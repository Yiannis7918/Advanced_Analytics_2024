(Wojciech Grzedzinski\nfor The Washington Post)\n\nListen\n\n11 min\n\nShare\n\nComment2889\n\nSave\n\nFormer president Donald Trump has privately said he could end Russia\u2019s war in\nUkraine by pressuring Ukraine to give up some territory, according to people\nfamiliar with the plan. Some foreign policy experts said Trump\u2019s idea would\nreward Russian President Vladimir Putin and condone the violation of\ninternationally recognized borders by force.\n\nTrump\u2019s proposal consists of pushing Ukraine to cede Crimea and the Donbas\nborder region to Russia, according to people who discussed it with Trump or\nhis advisers and spoke on the condition of anonymity because those\nconversations were confidential. That approach, which has not been previously\nreported, would dramatically reverse President Biden\u2019s policy, which has\nemphasized curtailing Russian aggression and providing military aid to\nUkraine.\n\nAs he seeks a return to power, the presumptive Republican nominee has\nfrequently boasted that he could negotiate a peace deal between Russia and\nUkraine within 24 hours if elected, even before taking office. But he has\nrepeatedly declined to specify publicly how he would quickly settle a war that\nhas raged for more than two years and killed tens of thousands of soldiers and\ncivilians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nTrump-aligned foreign-policy thinkers have emphasized addressing threats to\nU.S. interests from China and seeking ways to reverse Russia\u2019s increasing\ndependence on China for military, industrial and economic assistance. They\nhave also embraced limiting NATO expansion.\n\nFollow Election 2024\n\nPrivately, Trump has said that he thinks both Russia and Ukraine \u201cwant to save\nface, they want a way out,\u201d and that people in parts of Ukraine would be okay\nwith being part of Russia, according to a person who has discussed the matter\ndirectly with Trump.\n\nAccepting Russian control over parts of Ukraine would expand the reach of\nPutin\u2019s dictatorship after what has been the biggest land war in Europe since\nWorld War II. Some of Trump\u2019s supporters have been trying to persuade him\nagainst such an outcome.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been spending 100 percent of my time talking to Trump about Ukraine,\u201d\nsaid Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a onetime Trump critic turned ally. \u201cHe has\nto pay a price. He can\u2019t win at the end of this,\u201d Graham added, speaking of\nPutin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussia has previously declared it was annexing Ukrainian land beyond the\nDonbas region and Crimea and Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, has said\nhe would not accept surrendering any territory. Exchanging territory for a\ncease-fire would put Ukraine in a worse position without assurances that\nRussia would not rearm and resume hostilities, as it has in the past, said\nEmma Ashford, a senior fellow at the Stimson Center, a nonpartisan think tank.\n\u201cThat is a terrible deal,\u201d she said of Trump\u2019s proposal.\n\nThe Trump campaign declined to directly address questions for this article.\n\u201cAny speculation about President Trump\u2019s plan is coming from unnamed and\nuninformed sources who have no idea what is going on or what will happen,\u201d\ncampaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \u201cPresident Trump is\nthe only one talking about stopping the killing.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nBiden said in his State of the Union address that Putin is \u201con the march,\ninvading Ukraine and sowing chaos throughout Europe and beyond,\u201d and that\nUkraine is trying to defend itself. The president has outlined a long-term\nplan of support for Ukraine that would build up its military capabilities this\nyear so that it is in a better place to go on the offensive next year. But\nU.S. aid is already in jeopardy as House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) faces a\nrevolt from Republican hard-liners who are digging in against any more funding\nand clamoring to oust him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOut of office, Trump has pressured congressional Republicans to resist\nadditional American support for Ukraine\u2019s war effort and a return to the White\nHouse would significantly expand his influence over the debate. Seeing the\npolitical dynamics in the U.S., European allies have jump-started military\nindustry to a point where they hope to supplant a significant portion of the\ncurrent U.S. assistance to Kyiv. But analysts said that realistically,\nUkraine\u2019s capacity to keep fighting would be weakened if Trump succeeds in\nblocking further U.S. aid.\n\nIn many ways, Trump\u2019s plan is in line with his approach as president. His\npreference for splashy summits over policy details, confidence in his own\nnegotiating skills and impatience with conventional diplomatic protocols were\nall hallmarks of how he approached foreign affairs in his first term.\n\nIn his eight years as the GOP\u2019s standard-bearer, Trump has led a stark shift\nin the party\u2019s prevailing orientation to become more skeptical of foreign\nintervention such as military aid to Ukraine. Trump has consistently\ncomplimented Putin, expressed admiration for his dictatorial rule and gone out\nof his way to avoid criticizing him, most recently for the death in jail of\npolitical opponent Alexei Navalny. He has not called for the release of Evan\nGershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter held in Russia for a year\nwithout charges or a trial.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nTrump has refused to acknowledge Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election\nand falsely blamed Ukraine for trying to help Democratic rival Hillary Clinton\n\u2014 a smear spread by Russian spy services. His attempt in 2019 to withhold aid\nto Ukraine unless Zelensky announced an investigation into Biden led to\nTrump\u2019s first impeachment.\n\nIn a phone call with Zelensky that year that Trump said was \u201cperfect,\u201d the\nU.S. president pressured Zelensky to investigate Biden and the discredited\ntheory that Ukraine and not Russia sought to interfere with the 2016 election.\nThe GOP-controlled Senate later acquitted Trump.\n\n\u201cFormer president Trump\u2019s inexplicable and admiring relationship with Putin,\nalong with his unprecedented hostility to NATO, cannot give Europe or Ukraine\nany confidence in his dealings with Russia,\u201d said Tom Donilon, President\nBarack Obama\u2019s national security adviser. \u201cTrump\u2019s comments encouraging Russia\nto do whatever it wants with our European allies are among the most unsettling\nand dangerous statements made by a major party candidate for president. His\nposition represents a clear and present danger to U.S. and European security.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nGraham said he has warned against giving Russia desired land and wants Trump\nto embrace a pathway forward to Ukraine to join NATO.\n\n\u201cThe way you end this war to me is you make sure Ukraine gets into NATO and\nthe E.U.,\u201d he said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t say much about that. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s\nthought too much about it.\u201d\n\nIn his public promises to end the war, Trump has pointedly withheld the\nspecifics on how he would negotiate with Putin and Zelensky. \u201cI will say\ncertain things to each one of them that I wouldn\u2019t say to the rest of the\nworld, and that\u2019s why I can\u2019t tell you much more than that,\u201d Trump said in a\nMarch interview with former aide Sebastian Gorka.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nHis public silence on his negotiating tack has left room for others to fill in\nthe blanks. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has antagonized\nEuropean allies with his autocratic and pro-Russian tendencies, met with Trump\nlast month and afterward claimed Trump told him he will force the war to end\nbecause \u201che will not give a penny\u201d to help Ukraine. Orban\u2019s statement was\nfalse, but the former president didn\u2019t want to publicly contradict him after\nentertaining him all night at his Mar-a-Lago Club and admiring his toughness\nand anti-immigration positions, according to a person close to Trump, who\nspoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a private conversation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the meeting, Orban spoke at length about Soviet history, Russia\u2019s\ndesire for Ukrainian territory and the military challenges facing Ukraine, the\nperson said. Trump listened but was noncommittal, the person said. An Orban\nspokesman did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWord of Trump\u2019s plan for Ukraine circulated in Washington last November at a\nmeeting at the Heritage Foundation between right-of-center foreign policy\nfigures and a visiting delegation from the European Council on Foreign\nRelations. Former Trump White House aide Michael Anton described the expected\ncontours of Trump\u2019s peace plan as Ukraine ceding territory in Crimea and\nDonbas, limiting NATO expansion and enticing Putin to loosen his growing\nreliance on China, according to multiple people present for the meeting, who\nlike others spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a private\ndiscussion.\n\nReached by phone in March, Anton said he hadn\u2019t spoken with Trump in 18 to 24\nmonths and denied knowing anything about Trump\u2019s plan for Ukraine. He did not\nrespond to further questions.\n\nJames Carafano, a Heritage Foundation fellow who convened the meeting,\ndeclined to comment on the private discussion but criticized the idea of\nsplitting Russia from China. \u201cThat is stupid idea 101,\u201d he said. \u201cAnything you\ncould give Russia that they would really value would compromise all your other\ninterests. The way to deal with the Russia-China relationship is to make\nRussia a weaker partner.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nPeeling Russia away from China would presumably involve sanctions relief,\nsince the Kremlin has turned toward Beijing to try to offset broad-based\nWestern sanctions on its energy, defense and financial sectors, said Jeremy\nShapiro, head of the Washington office of the European Council on Foreign\nRelations, who brought the group\u2019s delegation to the meeting in November.\nShapiro declined to comment on the specifics of the conversation, citing\nground rules of the November event that prohibited attributing anything that\nwas said, but he said that Trump\u2019s Ukraine peace plan did not appear to be\ndetailed.\n\n\u201cTrump people feel as if one of the great sins of the Ukrainian war and the\nRussia policy, generally speaking, is to push Russia toward China and to make\nit all the more dependent on China,\u201d he said. Trump\u2019s \u201cfundamental approach\nwith all things is to get men in a room together to discuss,\u201d without\nnecessarily having detailed plans in advance, Shapiro said.\n\nRussia experts doubted Trump\u2019s peace efforts could succeed. Fiona Hill, a\nsenior fellow at the Brookings Institution who was Trump\u2019s top Russia adviser\nand has since emerged as a prominent critic, said it reminded her of 2017 \u2014\nwhen unvetted foreigners and business executives approached Trump with various\npeace plans, and he thought he could sit down with Russia and Ukraine and\nmediate on the strength of his personal charisma.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s team \u201cis thinking about this very much in silos, that this is just a\nUkraine-Russia thing,\u201d Hill said. \u201cThey think of it as a territorial dispute,\nrather than one about the whole future of European security and the world\norder by extension.\u201d\n\nEven drawing an armistice line might not be so straightforward. The Kremlin in\nSeptember 2022 declared that it was annexing four southern and eastern\nUkrainian provinces, including the Donbas region but extending well beyond it.\nSince Kyiv still controls much of the territory, any attempt to resolve the\nwar with territorial concessions is likely to involve extensive haggling \u2014\nunless both sides simply agree to freeze the front lines that are in place at\nthe moment of a deal.\n\nUkraine and European allies would probably resist Trump\u2019s efforts to strike a\ndeal with Moscow, Hill said. She said the Europeans have jump-started their\nmilitary industry to a point where they hope to supplant a significant portion\nof the current U.S. assistance to Kyiv. She added that the U.S. has limited\nleverage for a unilateral deal because meaningful sanctions relief would rely\non European cooperation.\n\n\u201cNo amount of leverage the United States has is likely to compel Ukrainian\nleadership to engage in policies that would constitute domestic political\nsuicide,\u201d said Michael Kofman, an analyst of the Russia-Ukraine war at the\nCarnegie Endowment for International Peace, a nonpartisan research center.\n\u201cAnd no amount of leverage the United States has can compel Ukraine to cede\nterritory or engage in these types of concessions. This is a situation where\nif you\u2019re willing to give a hand, the other side will very quickly want the\nrest of the arm.\u201d\n\n### Election 2024\n\nGet the latest news on the 2024 election from our reporters on the campaign\ntrail and in Washington.\n\nWho is running?
