The\nanalysts had two arguments for the downgrade: 1) the market overestimates Cash\nApp\u2019s gross profit growth potential (user growth should slow down, and it will\ntake time to scale lending), and 2) it will be difficult for Block to reignite\ngrowth in its Square business due to increasing competition.\n\nI will leave the topic of Square\u2019s growth potential for later, and today will\nfocus on Cash App. I would argue that Cash App\u2019s main growth driver, at least\nin the short term, will not be lending, but rather Cash App Pay. Cash App Pay\nallows Cash App users to make online, offline, and in-app purchases using\ntheir stored balance or connected debit cards. You can think of Cash App Pay\nas Block\u2019s alternative to the PayPal button.\n\nImage source: Q4 2023 Shareholder Letter\n\nIn its Q4 2023 Shareholder Letter, Block disclosed that in December 2023, Cash\nApp Pay generated $2.5 billion in annualized Gross Payment Volume. This is not\nmuch, but the product was rolled out only in late 2022, so it is growing fast.\nCash App Pay has a much higher take rate than the interchange that Block earns\non the Cash Card spending. Thus, even if only a portion of Cash Card spending\ngoes through Cash App Pay, it will give Block a meaningful boost to gross\nprofit.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nJevgenijs p.s. if you have feedback or questions, just reply to this email\n\nThanks for reading Popular Fintech! Subscribe to receive new posts and support\nmy work.\n\nA quick intro to Cash App Pay. Cash App Pay allows Cash App users to make\nonline, offline, and in-app purchases using their stored balance or connected\ndebit cards. You can think of Cash App Pay as Block\u2019s alternative to PayPal,\nwith Cash App Pay being the PayPal button at checkout, and Cash App being the\nPayPal wallet. Initially, it was available only to Square merchants, but later\nthe product was rolled out outside of Block\u2019s ecosystems. For example, the\nservice is available to U.S. merchants using Adyen or Stripe.\n\nImage source: Stripe\n\nTo understand the impact that Cash App Pay might have on Block\u2019s financials,\nwe need to go back to Block\u2019s Investor Day 2022. During its Investor Day,\nBlock\u2019s management revealed the \u201cinflows framework\u201d, which decomposes Cash\nApp\u2019s gross profit. Cash App\u2019s gross profit is the result of Monthly Active\nUsers multiplied by the Inflows per Active and multiplied by the Monetization\nRate. For instance, in Q4 2023, Cash App generated $942 million in gross\nprofit excluding the contribution from Afterpay.\n\nImage source: Q4 2023 Investor Presentation\n\nIn 2023, Cash App continued to gain customers with the number of monthly\nactive users reaching 56 million by December 2023, up 9.8% from 51 million in\nDecember 2022. The growth is slowing (the number of actives increased 15.9%\nYoY in December 2022, and 22.2% YoY in 2021), but continues. The slowdown in\nuser growth was one of the key Morgan Stanley\u2019s arguments for a bearish\noutlook on Cash App\u2019s gross profit growth prospects.\n\nImage source: Q4 2023 Investor Presentation\n\nInflows also continued to grow reaching $248 billion in 2023, an increase of\n22.2% compared to $203 billion in 2022. For the full year 2023, inflows per\nactive increased 8.2% YoY. Morgan Stanley analysts argued that Cash App users\nmight be approaching the maximum amount they can spend, given their income\nprofile (Cash App\u2019s customer base \u201cis largely made up of customers with a\nhousehold income of less than $100,000 per year\u201d).\n\nHowever, as per the comments in the company\u2019s latest Shareholder Letter,\nBlock\u2019s management sees the opportunity to \u201cserve customers with a household\nincome of up to $150,000 per year\u201d by improving Cash App\u2019s capabilities to\nserve families, including families \u201cwith higher-household-income parents and\ntheir dependents.\u201d Serving customers with higher income would extend Block\u2019s\nrunway in terms of growing inflows per active use.\n\nImage source: Q4 2023 Investor Presentation\n\nNow let\u2019s get to how Block monetizes these inflows...In 2023, 38% of Cash\nApp\u2019s gross profit came from Financial Services (Cash App Card interchange,\nATM fees, Cash App Borrow, interest on customer funds, and Cash App Pay), 29%\ncame from Instant Deposit fees, 17% was contributed by BNPL (Afterpay), 8%\ncame from peer-to-peer payments, and finally, 7% was contributed by Bitcoin\nmarkup.\n\nImage source: Q4 2023 Investor Presentation\n\nPlease note that the monetization rate used in the \u201cinflows framework\u201d does\nnot include BNPL. So, if we exclude BNPL contribution, then Cash App\u2019s gross\nprofit in 2023 was $3.57 billion, and Financial Services contributed 46% while\nInstant Deposit fees contributed 35% of Cash App\u2019s gross profit excluding the\ncontribution by BNPL.\n\nThe way to think about it is that Cash App customers added $248 billion to\ntheir accounts (the inflows), spent a portion of this money with the Cash Card\nand withdrew some via ATMs (with Cash App earning the interchange and ATM\nfees), spent some money with merchants using Cash App for Business (with Cash\nApp charging the merchant 2.75% fee), bought some Bitcoin (with Cash App\ncharging a 2.2% markup), and withdrew the rest to their accounts (in some\ncases using Instant Deposit and paying a 0.50 - 1.75% fee).\n\nLet\u2019s try to size these flows. Total inflows in 2023 were $248 billion. Money\nspent on Bitcoin was $9.5 billion (same as Bitcoin revenue). Some clients most\nlikely bought and then sold Bitcoin, but for the sake of simplicity, let\u2019s\nassume they bought and held. Cash App for Business GPV in the quarter was\n$18.1 billion (reported as Cash App GPV). Customer funds were almost unchanged\nfrom 2022 to 2023 according to Block\u2019s 10-K, so Cash App\u2019s customers did not\naccumulate extra balances on their accounts.\n\nThis means that roughly $220 billion was spent with Cash Card or withdrawn to\nbank accounts or via ATMs. Using Marqeta\u2019s disclosures (Marqeta is Cash App\u2019s\nissuer processor), I estimate that, in 2023, $140 billion was spent using Cash\nCard with Block earning around 0.90% on this spending in interchange. This\nleave around $80 billion that was withdrawn via ATMs, or to users\u2019 bank\naccounts. According to my estimates, the Cash Card volume increased by around\n30% compared to 2022.\n\nFinally, putting it all together. As can be seen from the pricing on Stripe\nand Adyen websites, Block charges merchants 2.9% for Cash App Pay\ntransactions. This means, that Cash App Pay has a 2-3 times higher\nmonetization rate than Cash Card, Instant Deposits, or ATM withdrawals. Even\nif the number of active users and the average inflows per active stop growing,\nCash App can continue growing its gross profit by incentivizing its customers\nto spend money via Cash App Pay instead of using Cash Card (or withdrawing\naltogether).\n\nImage source: Stripe\n\nYes, it will take some time for Block to get the adoption of the Cash App Pay.\nHowever, we should not forget that Block already has relationships with\nmerchants via Square and Afterpay, and merchants already see Cash App users\namongst their customers via Cash Card purchases. As per Block\u2019s disclosures,\nmore than 50% of Cash App spent was made in discretionary categories, such as\nbig box and discount retail, restaurants, as well as travel and entertainment.\n\nGetting back to the \u201cinflows framework.\u201d If Block manages to successfully\nscale Cash App Pay, monetization of the inflows will increase, as Cash App Pay\nhas a much higher take rate than Cash Card spend or ATM/Instant Deposit\nwithdrawals. I don\u2019t know how fast this will happen, but to illustrate the\npotential, we can assume that the monetization rate will increase from 1.48%\nto 2.00%. This would result in $1.3 billion in gross profit even if the number\nof actives and the inflow per active remain the same (see below). That\u2019s a 35%\ngrowth.\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts completely dismissed the idea of Block succeeding in\nconnecting merchants with Cash App users as \u201cdriving the necessary awareness\nand engagement to achieve that aspiration [ will be ] challenging.\u201d I\ndisagree. I believe Block can connect its two ecosystems and go beyond that by\ngetting Cash App Pay installed on non-Square merchant websites. Let the time\ntell who\u2019s right on this.\n\nThanks for reading Popular Fintech!
