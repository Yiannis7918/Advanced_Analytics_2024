It read:\n\u201cAlthough we may face some criticism later on, we are proposing to try and\nsuppress the guidelines for as long as possible on the grounds that the most\nrecent version is not relevant ... For now we\u2019ll do what we can to avoid\ndisclosure of these guidelines and try to do so in a way that looks\nlegitimate.\n\n\u201cHowever, we are ultimately withholding a key document and this may attract\nsome criticism ... we\u2019ll adopt this approach until such time as we sense the\ncriticism is becoming serious.\u201d\n\nWBD has been contacted for comment.\n\nWilliams told the inquiry it was a \u201cconcerning email\u201d and \u201cregrettable\u201d but\nadded that he \u201cdid not recall\u201d it or reply to it. He said the email was sent\nrelatively early in the litigation and before orders for disclosure were made.\n\u201cI do not believe POL [Post Office Ltd] sought to \u2018suppress\u2019 disclosure during\nthe litigation,\u201d he said in his witness statement.\n\nSir Wyn Williams, the retired judge chairing the inquiry, put to him: \u201cIn\nreality Mr Williams this email should have had a prompt response from you to\nthe effect that you can\u2019t possibly do that. That\u2019s right, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nThe Post Office lawyer replied: \u201cI\u2019d like to have said I did that, but I\ndidn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe testimony came as the government confirmed it had agreed to an independent\nreview of separate computer software linked to a second IT scandal at the Post\nOffice. The Department for Business and Trade will be setting out details\n\u201cshortly\u201d, Rishi Sunak\u2019s spokesperson said.\n\nThey added: \u201cAs soon as these specific accusations came to light, we asked the\npost office to investigate the Capture system. They have been investigating\ntheir records to identify postmasters that may have had issue with Capture,\nand we would continue to encourage anyone who has experienced issues to come\nforward so we can review that information.\u201d\n\nThe Horizon inquiry also heard on Thursday that as an in-house lawyer Williams\nwas involved in the Post Office\u2019s response to the BBC in 2014 as the\nbroadcaster prepared to broadcast a programme about branch operators and their\nconcerns about the Horizon system.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Business Today\n\nFree daily newsletter\n\nGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and\nanalysis you need every morning\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

I don\u2019t\nparticularly like working in Old Street [Post Office\u2019s premises] with its\nrodent problem,\u201d Bourke said. Williams replied that Bourke was \u201cthe only\nperson I\u2019ve met more cynical than me\u201d.\n\nJason Beer KC, counsel to the inquiry, put it to Williams that the email\n\u201cbanter\u201d between the two men showed \u201cbravado\u201d and competition \u201cabout who could\nbe more cynical about subpostmasters\u201d, with both men having the attitude that\n\u201csubpostmasters should put up with the system or leave\u201d.\n\nWilliams replied: \u201cI think you are reading too much into an email exchange.\u201d\n\nThe public inquiry continues.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Post Office Horizon scandal\n  * Post Office\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### Former Royal Mail chair apologises for \u2018tragic\u2019 Post Office prosecutions\n\n23h ago\n\n  * ### Post Office chief Nick Read cleared of misconduct in separate inquiry\n\n1d ago\n\n  * ### Former Post Office executive says he should not have said Horizon was robust\n\n2d ago\n\n  * ### Post office operators may prosecute to hold officials to account, says Alan Bates\n\n5d ago\n\n  * ### Ex-Post Office boss wrote of \u2018subbies with hand in the till\u2019, inquiry hears\n\n6d ago\n\n  * ### Post office operator wrongly jailed while pregnant rejects executive\u2019s apology\n\n7d ago\n\n  * ### Ex-MP tells inquiry Post Office ran a \u2018behind-the-scenes deception process\u2019\n\n10 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### Alan Bates tells Post Office inquiry ministers tried to sabotage his claim\n\n9 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### Adam Crozier and Alan Bates to give evidence at Post Office Horizon inquiry\n\n8 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### Post Office had flawed court defence, leaked internal report shows\n\n29 Mar 2024\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * UK\n  * UK politics\n  * Education\n  * Media\n  * Society\n  * Law\n  * Scotland\n  * Wales\n  * Northern Ireland\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
