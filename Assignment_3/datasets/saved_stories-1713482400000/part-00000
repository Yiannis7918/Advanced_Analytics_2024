(Tokyo\nElectron)\n\nTAKUYA MATSUDA, Nikkei staff writerApril 14, 2024 00:00 JST | Japan\n\nCopyCopied\n\nSENDAI, Japan -- Japanese chipmaking equipment manufacturer Tokyo Electron is\nmaking big capital investments in Japan's northeast, a region once known as\nthe \"Silicon Road,\" as the company works to hone mass-production technology\nseveral generations away.\n\nRelated suppliers are also setting up shop in nearby industrial parks,\ncreating a Tokyo Electron supply chain sphere in the Tohoku region seeking to\nreclaim its past glory as a semiconductor hub.\n\nConstruction is underway on a third development building on the company's\npremises in Miyagi prefecture, scheduled for completion in spring 2025.\n\n\"We are working with our customers to develop technology four generations into\nthe future,\" said Nobuto Doi, vice president at Tokyo Electron Miyagi.\n\nTokyo Electron Miyagi develops and produces plasma etching equipment, which\nhandles the process of defining circuit patterns formed by lithography on\nfilms coated onto wafers.\n\nThe company's development sites test cutting-edge technology to manufacture\nprototypes to the specifications of customers and prepare for mass production.\nThey serve important roles for bringing chip technology, which is evolving day\nby day, to practical use by working with the world's top chipmakers.\n\nIn the No. 1 development building, engineers evaluate whether wafers provided\nby customers can be etched into the desired shape. They also test whether the\nequipment can operate stably over a long period of time under set conditions\nlike gas type and pressure for mass production.\n\n\"In the end, our engineers go to the customer's factory and oversee use of the\nequipment for mass production,\" said a representative.\n\nIn addition to two development and production buildings, Tokyo Electron Miyagi\nopened an innovation center in 2021 to conduct joint research with other\ncompanies.\n\nAt the center's \"Flexible Lab,\" virtual reality technology projects a three-\ndimensional image of chipmaking equipment based on design drafts. The\ntechnology is used to finalize such details as parts and verify\nmaintainability.\n\nMeanwhile, in Oshu, Iwate prefecture, Tokyo Electron Technology Solutions --\nwhich handles equipment for wafer deposition, another core chipmaking process\n-- is building a production and logistics center to be completed in fall 2025.\nIt will be the company's seventh facility in Oshu.\n\nThe new building will have two floors, with deposition equipment produced on\nthe second floor. The first floor will house a distribution center that will\nstore parts made by partner companies, with the aim of shortening lead times.\n\nAll 12 lots in the Oshu industrial park have been reserved. Of the five\ncompanies scheduled to set up shop there, four, including a Tokyo Electron\nsubsidiary, are said to be related to chip manufacturing.\n\nTokyo Electron is playing an outsized role in the restoration of the once\nbooming semiconductor industry in Tohoku. Proximity to customers can help\nfacilitate troubleshooting with its products.\n\nMany Japanese semiconductor manufacturers have lost out in the investment race\nwith overseas companies. At the same time, companies supplying manufacturing\nequipment and materials still maintain a strong presence.\n\nClustering together semiconductor-related companies that support the\nchipmaking process could be key to strengthening the Japanese chip supply\nchain.\n\n## Read Next\n\n  * Semiconductors\n\n#### Shin-Etsu to bolster chip supply chain with first Japan plant in 56 years\n\n  * Semiconductors\n\n#### Japan outspends U.S., Germany on chip subsidies as share of GDP\n\n  * Semiconductors\n\n#### Renesas restarts shuttered plant to meet power chip demand\n\n  * Semiconductors\n\n#### TSMC expands Japan college collaboration amid worker shortage concern\n\n  * Markets\n\n#### Japan chip stocks slump amid signs of overheating\n\n## Latest On Semiconductors\n\n  * Semiconductors\n\n#### TSMC says global tech recovery 'not fast enough' despite AI boom\n\n  * Semiconductors\n\n#### Japan chip materials maker JSR seeks to scale up after $6bn takeover\n\n  * Semiconductors\n\n#### Thousands of Samsung employees rally for better working conditions\n\n## Sponsored Content\n\n### About Sponsored Content This content was commissioned by Nikkei's Global\nBusiness Bureau.\n\nDiscover the all new Nikkei Asia app\n\n#### Get Insights on Asia in your inbox\n\nRegister for our newsletters\n\n#### Connect With Us\n\nNikkei Inc.
