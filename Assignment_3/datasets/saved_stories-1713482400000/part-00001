These expectations, also called \u201cprior beliefs,\u201d help us\nmake sense of what we are perceiving in the present, based on similar past\nexperiences. Consider, for instance, how a shadow on a patient\u2019s X-ray image,\neasily missed by a less experienced intern, jumps out at a seasoned physician.\nThe physician\u2019s prior experience helps her arrive at the most probable\ninterpretation of a weak signal.\n\nThe process of combining prior knowledge with uncertain evidence is known as\nBayesian integration and is believed to widely impact our perceptions,\nthoughts, and actions. Now, MIT neuroscientists have discovered distinctive\nbrain signals that encode these prior beliefs. They have also found how the\nbrain uses these signals to make judicious decisions in the face of\nuncertainty.\n\n\u201cHow these beliefs come to influence brain activity and bias our perceptions\nwas the question we wanted to answer,\u201d says Mehrdad Jazayeri, the Robert A.\nSwanson Career Development Professor of Life Sciences, a member of MIT\u2019s\nMcGovern Institute for Brain Research, and the senior author of the study.\n\nThe researchers trained animals to perform a timing task in which they had to\nreproduce different time intervals. Performing this task is challenging\nbecause our sense of time is imperfect and can go too fast or too slow.\nHowever, when intervals are consistently within a fixed range, the best\nstrategy is to bias responses toward the middle of the range. This is exactly\nwhat animals did. Moreover, recording from neurons in the frontal cortex\nrevealed a simple mechanism for Bayesian integration: Prior experience warped\nthe representation of time in the brain so that patterns of neural activity\nassociated with different intervals were biased toward those that were within\nthe expected range.\n\nMIT postdoc Hansem Sohn, former postdoc Devika Narain, and graduate student\nNicolas Meirhaeghe are the lead authors of the study, which appears in the\nJuly 15 issue of Neuron.\n\nReady, set, go\n\nStatisticians have known for centuries that Bayesian integration is the\noptimal strategy for handling uncertain information. When we are uncertain\nabout something, we automatically rely on our prior experiences to optimize\nbehavior.\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t quite tell what something is, but from your prior experience you\nhave some expectation of what it ought to be, then you will use that\ninformation to guide your judgment,\u201d Jazayeri says. \u201cWe do this all the time.\u201d\n\nIn this new study, Jazayeri and his team wanted to understand how the brain\nencodes prior beliefs, and put those beliefs to use in the control of\nbehavior. To that end, the researchers trained animals to reproduce a time\ninterval, using a task called \u201cready-set-go.\u201d In this task, animals measure\nthe time between two flashes of light (\u201cready\u201d and \u201cset\u201d) and then generate a\n\u201cgo\u201d signal by making a delayed response after the same amount of time has\nelapsed.\n\nThey trained the animals to perform this task in two contexts. In the \u201cShort\u201d\nscenario, intervals varied between 480 and 800 milliseconds, and in the \u201cLong\u201d\ncontext, intervals were between 800 and 1,200 milliseconds. At the beginning\nof the task, the animals were given the information about the context (via a\nvisual cue), and therefore knew to expect intervals from either the shorter or\nlonger range.\n\nJazayeri had previously shown that humans performing this task tend to bias\ntheir responses toward the middle of the range. Here, they found that animals\ndo the same. For example, if animals believed the interval would be short, and\nwere given an interval of 800 milliseconds, the interval they produced was a\nlittle shorter than 800 milliseconds. Conversely, if they believed it would be\nlonger, and were given the same 800-millisecond interval, they produced an\ninterval a bit longer than 800 milliseconds.\n\n\u201cTrials that were identical in almost every possible way, except the animal\u2019s\nbelief led to different behaviors,\u201d Jazayeri says. \u201cThat was compelling\nexperimental evidence that the animal is relying on its own belief.\u201d\n\nOnce they had established that the animals relied on their prior beliefs, the\nresearchers set out to find how the brain encodes prior beliefs to guide\nbehavior. They recorded activity from about 1,400 neurons in a region of the\nfrontal cortex, which they have previously shown is involved in timing.\n\nDuring the \u201cready-set\u201d epoch, the activity profile of each neuron evolved in\nits own way, and about 60 percent of the neurons had different activity\npatterns depending on the context (Short versus Long). To make sense of these\nsignals, the researchers analyzed the evolution of neural activity across the\nentire population over time, and found that prior beliefs bias behavioral\nresponses by warping the neural representation of time toward the middle of\nthe expected range.\n\n\u201cWe have never seen such a concrete example of how the brain uses prior\nexperience to modify the neural dynamics by which it generates sequences of\nneural activities, to correct for its own imprecision. This is the unique\nstrength of this paper: bringing together perception, neural dynamics, and\nBayesian computation into a coherent framework, supported by both theory and\nmeasurements of behavior and neural activities,\u201d says Mate Lengyel, a\nprofessor of computational neuroscience at Cambridge University, who was not\ninvolved in the study.\n\nEmbedded knowledge\n\nResearchers believe that prior experiences change the strength of connections\nbetween neurons. The strength of these connections, also known as synapses,\ndetermines how neurons act upon one another and constrains the patterns of\nactivity that a network of interconnected neurons can generate. The finding\nthat prior experiences warp the patterns of neural activity provides a window\nonto how experience alters synaptic connections. \u201cThe brain seems to embed\nprior experiences into synaptic connections so that patterns of brain activity\nare appropriately biased,\u201d Jazayeri says.\n\nAs an independent test of these ideas, the researchers developed a computer\nmodel consisting of a network of neurons that could perform the same ready-\nset-go task. Using techniques borrowed from machine learning, they were able\nto modify the synaptic connections and create a model that behaved like the\nanimals.\n\nThese models are extremely valuable as they provide a substrate for the\ndetailed analysis of the underlying mechanisms, a procedure that is known as\n\"reverse-engineering.\u201d Remarkably, reverse-engineering the model revealed that\nit solved the task the same way the monkeys\u2019 brain did. The model also had a\nwarped representation of time according to prior experience.\n\nThe researchers used the computer model to further dissect the underlying\nmechanisms using perturbation experiments that are currently impossible to do\nin the brain. Using this approach, they were able to show that unwarping the\nneural representations removes the bias in the behavior. This important\nfinding validated the critical role of warping in Bayesian integration of\nprior knowledge.\n\nThe researchers now plan to study how the brain builds up and slowly fine-\ntunes the synaptic connections that encode prior beliefs as an animal is\nlearning to perform the timing task.\n\nThe research was funded by the Center for Sensorimotor Neural Engineering, the\nNetherlands Scientific Organization, the Marie Sklodowska Curie Reintegration\nGrant, the National Institutes of Health, the Sloan Foundation, the\nKlingenstein Foundation, the Simons Foundation, the McKnight Foundation, and\nthe McGovern Institute.\n\n### Share this news article on:\n\n  * X\n  * Facebook\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Reddit\n  * Print\n\n## Related Links\n\n  * Paper: \"Bayesian computation through cortical latent dynamics\"\n  * Mehrdad Jazayeri\n  * McGovern Institute for Brain Research\n  * Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences\n  * School of Science\n\n## Related Topics\n\n  * Research\n  * Brain and cognitive sciences\n  * Memory\n  * Neuroscience\n  * McGovern Institute\n  * School of Science\n  * National Institutes of Health (NIH)\n\n## Related Articles\n\n### How we make complex decisions\n\n### Study reveals how the brain overcomes its own limitations\n\n### How the brain performs flexible computations\n\n## More MIT News\n\n### New major crosses disciplines to address climate change\n\nCombining engineering, earth system science, and the social sciences, Course\n1-12 prepares students to develop climate solutions.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n### Four MIT faculty named 2023 AAAS Fellows\n\nEngelward, Oliver, Rothman, and Vuleti\u0107 are recognized for their efforts to\nadvance science.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n### For more open and equitable public discussions on social media, try\n\u201cmeronymity\u201d\n\nA communication system whose users reveal only a few verified aspects of their\nidentity can empower less confident participants to speak up, researchers\nreport.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n### Erin Kara named Edgerton Award winner\n\nThe award recognizes exceptional distinction in teaching, research, and\nservice at MIT.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n### Q&A: Claire Walsh on how J-PAL\u2019s King Climate Action Initiative tackles\nthe twin climate and poverty crises\n\nSince 2020, K-CAI has innovated and tested climate policies in more than 35\ncountries and supported scale-ups that have reached over 15 million people.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n### Knight Science Journalism Program launches HBCU Science Journalism\nFellowship\n\nThe fellowship will incubate early-career science journalists, providing them\nwith a year of skill-building freelance experience and dedicated mentorship.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n  * More news on MIT News homepage \u2192\n\n## More about MIT News at Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nThis website is managed by the MIT News Office, part of the Institute Office\nof Communications.\n\n### News by Schools/College:\n\n  * School of Architecture and Planning\n  * School of Engineering\n  * School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences\n  * MIT Sloan School of Management\n  * School of Science\n  * MIT Schwarzman College of Computing\n\n### Resources:\n\n  * About the MIT News Office\n  * MIT News Press Center\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Press Inquiries\n  * Filming Guidelines\n  * RSS Feeds\n\n### Tools:\n\n  * Subscribe to MIT Daily/Weekly\n  * Subscribe to press releases\n  * Submit campus news\n  * Guidelines for campus news contributors\n  * Guidelines on generative AI\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA,\nUSA\n\nRecommended Links:\n\n  * Visit\n  * Map (opens in new window)\n  * Events (opens in new window)\n  * People (opens in new window)\n  * Careers (opens in new window)\n  * Contact\n  * Privacy\n  * Accessibility\n  *     * Social Media Hub\n    * MIT on X\n    * MIT on Facebook\n    * MIT on YouTube\n    * MIT on Instagram\n\n", "frontpage": false}
