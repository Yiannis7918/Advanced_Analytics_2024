Back then, it was idyllic. Or at least it felt that way as a\n5-year-old kid.\n\nI had friends every few houses, a massive park at the end of the street, and a\nconvenience store two blocks over that always had Reese's Cups on sale.\nF*cking perfection.\n\nIt was the 90s, so us kids did pretty much whatever we wanted. Kickball in the\nstreet, racing bikes past dark, stealing Playboys from our friend's dad's\nbasement and reading them on the sidewalk in broad daylight. Ah, good times.\n\nBut that\u2019s why when Tim (we\u2019ll call him Tim even though that\u2019s not his real\nname) invited me over to his house to play video games, I immediately said\nyes. Tim and his parents (whom I hadn't met yet) had just moved into the\nneighborhood, about 5 houses down on the opposite end of the street (all this\ninfo will matter later).\n\nWe head over, and his house is awesome. There\u2019s posters of rock bands\neverywhere, not just in his room, but literally all over the house. And it\nsmells like barbeque sauce. I honestly have no freaking idea why those are the\ntwo things I remember, but that was my 5-year-old brain for you.\n\nTim\u2019s asking me what we should play and showing me his gaming collection when\nI hear voices. Oh, that must be his parents. As they get closer, they\nsound...bigger. Before I can finish processing the thought, in pop two of the\nlargest grown-ups I had ever seen smiling ear to ear.\n\nSo, what do I do? Yell, \u201cPLEASE DON\u2019T EAT ME!\u201d And proceed to run, yes Usain\nBolt sprint, back to my house across the street.\n\nMy god, do I wish I was making this story up. But it\u2019s 100% the truth.\n\nOh, and all because of Hymie.\n\n## Keep reading with a 7-day free trial\n\nSubscribe to Bending Pink Steel to keep reading this post and get 7 days of\nfree access to the full post archives.\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
