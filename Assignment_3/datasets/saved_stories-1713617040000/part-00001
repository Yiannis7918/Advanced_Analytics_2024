His tactics to secure\nvictory for Microsoft as its CEO look bolder by the day.\n\nMicrosoft's latest move to steamroll the competition in AI came this week when\nit emerged that it was investing $1.5 billion in G42 \u2014 an Abu Dhabi AI-\ndevelopment firm that has slowly built ties with OpenAI, the Redmond giant's\nmain partner in the field.\n\nBut making it happen required some shrewd maneuvering on Microsoft's part.\n\nG42 has been a concern for US lawmakers after it first partnered with OpenAI\nin October. The Emirati firm's CEO, Peng Xiao, once led a subsidiary of\nDarkMatter, a spyware company previously in the crosshairs of US law\nenforcement after three people linked to the firm admitted to unlawful\nhacking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nG42 also has ties to Huawei, a Chinese tech giant sanctioned by the US over\nfears its telecoms gear can offer surveillance backdoors to Beijing. Although\nG42 has denied \"connections to the Chinese government,\" it hasn't stopped the\nWhite House from making noise about risks.\n\nBut with G42 reported to be in talks to finance a new chip venture planned by\nOpenAI's chief, Sam Altman, it seems Nadella didn't want to cut G42 out of the\npicture.\n\nRelated stories\n\nIt's why ahead of the $1.5 billion investment, Microsoft was reported to have\nworked closely with the US government and G42 behind closed doors to offer\nguarantees that the Emirati firm would divest from China. Microsoft's\npresident, Brad Smith, who's a key Nadella lieutenant, is also set to join its\nboard.\n\n> .@Microsoft's investment in @G42ai will enhance the UAE\u2019s position as a\n> leading #AI hub and provide digital infrastructure and services to help\n> underserved nations innovate and grow. We will combine world-class\n> technology with world-leading standards for safe, trusted, and...\n>\n> \u2014 Brad Smith (@BradSmi) April 16, 2024\n\nGiven China's huge market, it's hard to imagine the decision came easy for\nG42, not least because the United Arab Emirates has dedicated much time and\neffort to forging business relations with China. But it seems Nadella was able\nto offer something even better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is just the latest instance of Nadella making clever power plays to\nsecure Microsoft's position as the team to beat in AI.\n\nSince the drama that unfolded at OpenAI in November with the firing and\nrehiring of Altman, the Microsoft CEO has diversified the number of higher-\nprofile bets his company has in AI.\n\nLast month, Nadella pulled off a big coup by hiring Mustafa Suleyman, a\ncofounder of DeepMind who was the CEO of Inflection AI, and several of his\nsoftware engineers to head up a new AI division at Microsoft.\n\nMustafa Suleyman. Inflection\n\nThe move involved a $650 million payment to Inflection AI that would also\nallow Microsoft to license Inflection's AI models. The cash was reported to\nallow Inflection to pay its investors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, from Microsoft's point of view, it was a small price to pay to secure\ntalent and access to technology playing a similar game to OpenAI.\n\nMicrosoft made a similar bet on an OpenAI rival earlier this year after\ninvesting in Paris' Mistral AI in a deal that it described as a \"multi-year\npartnership.\" Mistral has accrued a $2 billion valuation less than 12 months\nsince its founding in April 2023.\n\nThese sprawling bets are now forming a part of Nadella's bigger plan to take\nhis rivals to task. Their ability to compete is set to increasingly depend on\ntheir response to his gambit.\n\nAxel Springer, Business Insider's parent company, has a global deal to allow\nOpenAI to train its models on its media brands' reporting.\n\nRead next\n\n### Watch: Sam Altman moves to Microsoft after OpenAI fires him as CEO\n\nMicrosoft OpenAI AI\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecommended video\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollow us on:\n\n  * * Copyright \u00a9 2024 Insider Inc.
