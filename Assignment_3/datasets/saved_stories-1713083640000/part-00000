Social factors that prohibit success include:\nsecrecy and paranoia, pride, class structure, a lack of coordination on all\nlevels, and little individual freedom or initiative.\n\nArabic-speaking armies have been generally ineffective in the modern era.\nEgyptian regular forces did poorly against Yemeni irregulars in the 1960s. _1\nSyrians could only impose their will in Lebanon during the mid-1970s by the\nuse of overwhelming weaponry and numbers. _2 Iraqis showed ineptness against\nan Iranian military ripped apart by revolutionary turmoil in the 1980s and\ncould not win a three-decades-long war against the Kurds. _3 The Arab military\nperformance on both sides of the 1990 Kuwait war was mediocre. _3 And the\nArabs have done poorly in nearly all the military confrontations with Israel.\nWhy this unimpressive record? There are many factors--economic, ideological,\ntechnical--but perhaps the most important has to do with culture and certain\nsocietal attributes which inhibit Arabs from producing an effective military\nforce.\n\nIt is a truism of military life that an army fights as it trains, and so I\ndraw on my many years of firsthand observation of Arabs in training to draw\nconclusions about the ways in which they go into combat. The following\nimpressions derive from personal experience with Arab military establishments\nin the capacity of U.S. military attach\u00e9 and security assistance officer,\nobserver officer with the British-officer Trucial Oman Scouts (the security\nforce in the emirates prior to the establishment of the United Arab Emirates),\nas well as some thirty years\ufffd study of the Middle East.\n\nFalse Starts\n\nIncluding culture in strategic assessments has a poor legacy, for it has often\nbeen spun from an ugly brew of ignorance, wishful thinking, and mythology.\nThus, the U.S. army in the 1930s evaluated the Japanese national character as\nlacking originality and drew the unwarranted conclusion that the country would\nbe permanently disadvantaged in technology. _5 Hitler dismissed the United\nStates as a mongrel society _6 and consequently underestimated the impact of\nAmerica\ufffds entry into the war. As these examples suggest, when culture is\nconsidered in calculating the relative strengths and weaknesses of opposing\nforces, it tends to lead to wild distortions, especially when it is a matter\nof understanding why states unprepared for war enter into combat flushed with\nconfidence. The temptation is to impute cultural attributes to the enemy state\nthat negate its superior numbers or weaponry. Or the opposite: to view the\npotential enemy through the prism of one\ufffds own cultural norms. American\nstrategists assumed that the pain threshold of the North Vietnamese\napproximated their own and that the air bombardment of the North would bring\nit to its knees. _7 Three days of aerial attacks were thought to be all the\nSerbs could withstand; in fact, seventy-eight days were needed.\n\nIt is particularly dangerous to make facile assumptions about abilities in\nwarfare based on past performance, for societies evolve and so does the\nmilitary subculture with it. The dismal French performance in the 1870 Franco-\nPrussian war led the German high command to an overly optimistic assessment\nprior to World War I. _8 The tenacity and courage of French soldiers in World\nWar I led everyone from Winston Churchill to the German high command vastly to\noverestimate the French army\ufffds fighting abilities. _9 Israeli generals\nunderestimated the Egyptian army of 1973 based on Egypt\ufffds hapless performance\nin the 1967 war. _10\n\nCulture is difficult to pin down. It is not synonymous with an individual\ufffds\nrace nor ethnic identity. The history of warfare makes a mockery of attempts\nto assign rigid cultural attributes to individuals--as the military histories\nof the Ottoman and Roman empires illustrate. In both cases it was training,\ndiscipline, esprit, and \u00e9lan which made the difference, not the individual\nsoldiers\ufffd origin. _11 The highly disciplined, effective Roman legions, for\nexample, were recruited from throughout the Roman empire, and the elite\nOttoman Janissaries (slave soldiers) were Christians forcibly recruited as\nboys from the Balkans.\n\nThe Role of Culture\n\nThese problems notwithstanding, culture does need to be taken into account.\nIndeed, awareness of prior mistakes should make it possible to assess the role\nof cultural factors in warfare. John Keegan, the eminent historian of warfare,\nargues that culture is a prime determinant of the nature of warfare. In\ncontrast to the usual manner of European warfare which he terms \ufffdface to\nface,\ufffd Keegan depicts the early Arab armies in the Islamic era as masters of\nevasion, delay, and indirection. _12 Examining Arab warfare in this century\nleads to the conclusion that Arabs remain more successful in insurgent, or\npolitical warfare _13 --what T. E. Lawrence termed \ufffdwinning wars without\nbattles.\ufffd _14 Even the much-lauded Egyptian crossing of the Suez in 1973 at\nits core entailed a masterful deception plan. It may well be that these\nseemingly permanent attributes result from a culture that engenders subtlety,\nindirection, and dissimulation in personal relationships. _15\n\nAlong these lines, Kenneth Pollack concludes his exhaustive study of Arab\nmilitary effectiveness by noting that \ufffdcertain patterns of behavior fostered\nby the dominant Arab culture were the most important factors contributing to\nthe limited military effectiveness of Arab armies and air forces from 1945 to\n1991.\ufffd _16 These attributes included over-centralization, discouraging\ninitiative, lack of flexibility, manipulation of information, and the\ndiscouragement of leadership at the junior officer level.\n\nThe barrage of criticism leveled at Samuel Huntington\ufffds notion of a \ufffdclash of\ncivilizations\ufffd _17 in no way lessens the vital point he made--that however\nmuch the grouping of peoples by religion and culture rather than political or\neconomic divisions offends academics who propound a world defined by class,\nrace, and gender, it is a reality, one not diminished by modern\ncommunications.\n\nBut how does one integrate the study of culture into military training? At\npresent, it has hardly any role. Paul M. Belbutowski, a scholar and former\nmember of the U.S. Delta Force, succinctly stated a deficiency in our own\nmilitary education system: \ufffdCulture, comprised of all that is vague and\nintangible, is not generally integrated into strategic planning except at the\nmost superficial level.\ufffd _18 And yet it is precisely \ufffdall that is vague and\nintangible\ufffd which defines low-intensity conflicts. The Vietnamese communists\ndid not fight the war the United States had trained for, nor did the Chechens\nand Afghans fight the war the Russians prepared for. This entails far more\nthan simply retooling weaponry and retraining soldiers. It requires an\nunderstanding of the enemy\ufffds cultural mythology, history, attitude toward\ntime, etc.--demanding a more substantial investment in time and money than a\nbureaucratic organization is likely to authorize.\n\nMindful of walking through a minefield of past errors and present cultural\nsensibilities, I offer some assessments of the role of culture in the military\ntraining of Arabic-speaking officers. I confine myself principally to training\nfor two reasons. First, I observed much training but only one combat campaign\n(the Jordanian Army against the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1970).\nSecondly, armies fight as they train. Troops are conditioned by peacetime\nhabits, policies, and procedures; they do not undergo a sudden metamorphosis\nthat transforms civilians in uniform into warriors. General George Patton was\nfond of relating the story about Julius Caesar, who \ufffdIn the winter time. . .\nso trained his legions in all that became soldiers and so habituated them to\nthe proper performance of their duties, that when in the spring he committed\nthem to battle against the Gauls, it was not necessary to give them orders,\nfor they knew what to do and how to do it.\ufffd _19\n\nInformation as Power\n\nIn every society information is a means of making a living or wielding power,\nbut Arabs husband information and hold it especially tightly. U.S. trainers\nhave often been surprised over the years by the fact that information provided\nto key personnel does not get much further than them. Having learned to\nperform some complicated procedure, an Arab technician knows that he is\ninvaluable so long as he is the only one in a unit to have that knowledge;\nonce he dispenses it to others he no longer is the only font of knowledge and\nhis power dissipates. This explains the commonplace hoarding of manuals,\nbooks, training pamphlets, and other training or logistics literature. On one\noccasion, an American mobile training team working with armor in Egypt at long\nlast received the operators\ufffd manuals that had laboriously been translated into\nArabic. The American trainers took the newly-minted manuals straight to the\ntank park and distributed them to the tank crews. Right behind them, the\ncompany commander, a graduate of the armor school at Fort Knox and specialized\ncourses at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds ordnance school, collected the manuals\nfrom the crews. Questioned why he did this, the commander said that there was\nno point in giving them to the drivers because enlisted men could not read. In\npoint of fact, he did not want enlisted men to have an independent source of\nknowledge. Being the only person who can explain the fire control\ninstrumentation or boresight artillery weapons brings prestige and attention.\nIn military terms this means that very little cross-training is accomplished\nand that, for instance in a tank crew, the gunners, loaders, and drivers might\nbe proficient in their jobs but are not prepared to fill in for a casualty.\nNot understanding one another\ufffds jobs also inhibits a smoothly functioning\ncrew. At a higher level it means there is no depth in technical proficiency.\n\nEducation Problems\n\nTraining tends to be unimaginative, cut and dried, and not challenging.\nBecause the Arab educational system is predicated on rote memorization,\nofficers have a phenomenal ability to commit vast amounts of knowledge to\nmemory. The learning system tends to consist of on-high lectures, with\nstudents taking voluminous notes and being examined on what they were told.\n(It also has interesting implications for foreign instructors; for example,\nhis credibility is diminished if he must resort to a book.) The emphasis on\nmemorization has a price, and that is in diminished ability to reason or\nengage in analysis based upon general principles. Thinking outside the box is\nnot encouraged; doing so in public can damage a career. Instructors are not\nchallenged and neither, in the end, are students.\n\nHead-to-head competition among individuals is generally avoided, at least\nopenly, for it means that someone wins and someone else loses, with the loser\nhumiliated. This taboo has particular import when a class contains mixed\nranks. Education is in good part sought as a matter of personal prestige, so\nArabs in U.S. military schools take pains to ensure that the ranking member,\naccording to military position or social class, scores the highest marks in\nthe class. Often this leads to \ufffdsharing answers\ufffd in class--often in a rather\novert manner or junior officers concealing scores higher than their\nsuperior\ufffds.\n\nAmerican military instructors dealing with Middle Eastern students learn to\nensure that, before directing any question to a student in a classroom\nsituation, particularly if he is an officer, the student does possess the\ncorrect answer. If this is not assured, the officer will feel he has been set\nup for public humiliation. Furthermore, in the often-paranoid environment of\nArab political culture, he will believe this setup to have been purposeful.\nThis student will then become an enemy of the instructor and his classmates\nwill become apprehensive about their also being singled out for humiliation--\nand learning becomes impossible.\n\nOfficer vs. Soldiers\n\nArab junior officers are well trained on the technical aspects of their\nweapons and tactical know-how, but not in leadership, a subject given little\nattention. For example, as General Sa\ufffdd ash-Shazli, the Egyptian chief of\nstaff, noted in his assessment of the army he inherited prior to the 1973 war,\nthey were not trained to seize the initiative or volunteer original concepts\nor new ideas. _20 Indeed, leadership may be the greatest weakness of Arab\ntraining systems. This problem results from two main factors: a highly\naccentuated class system bordering on a caste system, and lack of a non-\ncommissioned-officer development program.\n\nMost Arab officers treat enlisted soldiers like sub-humans. When the winds in\nEgypt one day carried biting sand particles from the desert during a\ndemonstration for visiting U.S. dignitaries, I watched as a contingent of\nsoldiers marched in and formed a single rank to shield the Americans; Egyptian\nsoldiers, in other words, are used on occasion as nothing more than a\nwindbreak. The idea of taking care of one\ufffds men is found only among the most\nelite units in the Egyptian military. On a typical weekend, officers in units\nstationed outside Cairo will get in their cars and drive off to their homes,\nleaving the enlisted men to fend for themselves by trekking across the desert\nto a highway and flagging down busses or trucks to get to the Cairo rail\nsystem. Garrison cantonments have no amenities for soldiers. The same\nsituation, in various degrees, exists elsewhere in the Arabic-speaking\ncountries--less so in Jordan, even more so in Iraq and Syria.\n\nThe young draftees who make up the bulk of the Egyptian army hate military\nservice for good reason and will do almost anything, including self-\nmutilation, to avoid it. In Syria the wealthy buy exemptions or, failing that,\nare assigned to noncombatant organizations. As a young Syrian told me, his\nmusical skills came from his assignment to a Syrian army band where he learned\nto play an instrument. In general, the militaries of the Fertile Crescent\nenforce discipline by fear; in countries where a tribal system still is in\nforce, such as Saudi Arabia, the innate egalitarianism of the society\nmitigates against fear as the prime motivator, so a general lack of discipline\npervades. _21\n\nThe social and professional gap between officers and enlisted men is present\nin all armies, but in the United States and other Western forces, the\nnoncommissioned officer (NCO) corps bridges it. Indeed, a professional NCO\ncorps has been critical for the American military to work at its best; as the\nprimary trainers in a professional army, NCOs are critical to training\nprograms and to the enlisted men\ufffds sense of unit esprit. Most of the Arab\nworld either has no NCO corps or it is non-functional, severely handicapping\nthe military\ufffds effectiveness. With some exceptions, NCOs are considered in the\nsame low category as enlisted men and so do not serve as a bridge between\nenlisted men and officers. Officers instruct but the wide social gap between\nenlisted man and officer tends to make the learning process perfunctory,\nformalized, and ineffective. The show-and-tell aspects of training are\nfrequently missing because officers refuse to get their hands dirty and prefer\nto ignore the more practical aspects of their subject matter, believing this\nbelow their social station. A dramatic example of this occurred during the\nGulf war when a severe windstorm blew down the tents of Iraqi officer\nprisoners of war. For three days they stayed in the wind and rain rather than\nbe observed by enlisted prisoners in a nearby camp working with their hands.\n\nThe military price for this is very high. Without the cohesion supplied by\nNCOs, units tend to disintegrate in the stress of combat. This is primarily a\nfunction of the fact that the enlisted soldiers simply do not trust their\nofficers. Once officers depart the training areas, training begins to fall\napart as soldiers begin drifting off. An Egyptian officer once explained to me\nthat the Egyptian army\ufffds catastrophic defeat in 1967 resulted from a lack of\ncohesion within units. The situation, he said, had only marginally improved in\n1973. Iraqi prisoners in 1991 showed a remarkable fear and enmity toward their\nofficers.\n\nDecisionmaking and Responsibility\n\nDecisions are made and delivered from on high, with very little lateral\ncommunication. This leads to a highly centralized system, with authority\nhardly ever delegated. Rarely does an officer make a critical decision on his\nown; instead, he prefers the safe course of being identified as industrious,\nintelligent, loyal--and compliant. Bringing attention to oneself as an\ninnovator or someone prone to make unilateral decisions is a recipe for\ntrouble. As in civilian life, conformism is the overwhelming societal norm;\nthe nail that stands up gets hammered down. Orders and information flow from\ntop to bottom; they are not to be reinterpreted, amended, or modified in any\nway.\n\nU.S. trainers often experience frustration obtaining a decision from a\ncounterpart, not realizing that the Arab officer lacks the authority to make\nthe decision--a frustration amplified by the Arab\ufffds understandable reluctance\nto admit that he lacks that authority. This author has several times seen\ndecisions that could have been made at the battalion level concerning such\nmatters as class meeting times and locations requiring approval from the\nministry of defense. All of which has led American trainers to develop a rule\nof thumb: a sergeant first class in the U.S. Army has as much authority as a\ncolonel in an Arab army. Methods of instruction and subject matter are\ndictated from higher authorities. Unit commanders have very little to say\nabout these affairs. The politicized nature of the Arab militaries means that\npolitical factors weigh heavily and frequently override military\nconsiderations. Officers with initiative and a predilection for unilateral\naction pose a threat to the regime. This can be seen not just at the level of\nnational strategy but in every aspect of military operations and training. If\nArab militaries became less politicized and more professional in preparation\nfor the 1973 war with Israel, _22 once the fighting ended, old habits\nreturned. Now, an increasingly bureaucratized military establishment weighs in\nas well. A veteran of the Pentagon turf wars will feel like a kindergartner\nwhen he encounters the rivalries that exist in the Arab military headquarters.\n\nTaking responsibility for a policy, operation, status, or training program\nrarely occurs. U.S. trainers can find it very frustrating when they repeatedly\nencounter Arab officers placing blame for unsuccessful operations or programs\non the U.S. equipment or some other outside source. A high rate of non-\noperational U.S. equipment is blamed on a \ufffdlack of spare parts\ufffd--pointing a\nfinger at an unresponsive U.S. supply system despite the fact that American\ntrainers can document ample supplies arriving in country and disappearing in a\nmalfunctioning supply system. (Such criticism was never caustic or personal\nand often so indirect and politely delivered that it wasn\ufffdt until after a\nmeeting that oblique references were understood.) This imperative works even\nat the most exalted levels. During the Kuwait war, Iraqi forces took over the\ntown of Khafji in northeast Saudi Arabia after the Saudis had evacuated the\nplace. General Khalid bin Sultan, the Saudi ground forces commander, requested\na letter from General Norman Schwarzkopf, stating it was the U.S. general who\nordered an evacuation from the Saudi town. _23 And in his account of the\nKhafji battle, General Bin Sultan predictably blames the Americans for the\nIraqi occupation of the town. _24 In reality the problem was that the light\nSaudi forces in the area left the battlefield. _25 The Saudis were in fact\noutgunned and outnumbered by the Iraqi unit approaching Khafji but Saudi pride\nrequired that foreigners be blamed.\n\nAs for equipment, a vast cultural gap exists between the U.S. and Arab\nmaintenance and logistics systems. The Arab difficulties with U.S. equipment\nare not, as sometimes simplistically believed, a matter of \ufffdArabs don\ufffdt do\nmaintenance,\ufffd but something much deeper. The American concept of a weapons\nsystem does not convey easily. A weapons system brings with it specific\nmaintenance and logistics procedures, policies, and even a philosophy, all of\nthem based on U.S. culture, with its expectations of a certain educational\nlevel, sense of small unit responsibility, tool allocation, and doctrine.\nTools that would be allocated to a U.S. battalion (a unit of some 600-800\npersonnel) would most likely be found at a much higher level--probably two or\nthree echelons higher--in an Arab army. The expertise, initiative and, most\nimportantly, the trust indicated by delegation of responsibility to a lower\nlevel are rare. The U.S. equipment and its maintenance are predicated on a\nconcept of repair at the lowest level and therefore require delegation of\nauthority. Without the needed tools, spare parts, or expertise available to\nkeep equipment running, and loathe to report bad news to his superiors, the\nunit commander looks for scapegoats. All this explains why I many times heard\nin Egypt that U.S. weaponry is \ufffdtoo delicate.\ufffd\n\nI have observed many in-country U.S. survey teams: invariably, hosts make the\ncase for acquiring the most modern of military hardware and do everything to\navoid issues of maintenance, logistics, and training. They obfuscate and\nmislead to such an extent that U.S. teams, no matter how earnest their sense\nof mission, find it nearly impossible to help. More generally, Arab reluctance\nto be candid about training deficiencies makes it extremely difficult for\nforeign advisors properly to support instruction or assess training needs.\n\nCombined Arms Operations\n\nA lack of cooperation is most apparent in the failure of all Arab armies to\nsucceed at combined arms operations. A regular Jordanian army infantry\ncompany, for example, is man-for-man as good as a comparable Israeli company;\nat battalion level, however, the coordination required for combined arms\noperations, with artillery, air, and logistics support, is simply absent.\nIndeed, the higher the echelon, the greater the disparity. This results from\ninfrequent combined arms training; when it does take place, it is intended to\nimpress visitors (which it does--the dog-and-pony show is usually done with\nuncommon gusto and theatrical talent) rather than provide real training.\n\nThis problem results from three main factors. First, the well-known lack of\ntrust among Arabs for anyone outside their own family adversely affects\noffensive operations. _26 Exceptions to this pattern are limited to elite\nunits (which throughout the Arab world have the same duty--to protect the\nregime, rather than the country). In a culture in which almost every sphere of\nhuman endeavor, including business and social relationships, is based on a\nfamily structure, this orientation is also present in the military,\nparticularly in the stress of battle. Offensive action, basically, consists of\nfire and maneuver. The maneuver element must be confident that supporting\nunits or arms are providing covering fire. If there is a lack of trust in that\nsupport, getting troops moving forward against dug-in defenders is possible\nonly by officers getting out front and leading, something that has not been a\ncharacteristic of Arab leadership.\n\nSecond, the complex mosaic system of peoples creates additional problems for\ntraining, as rulers in the Middle East make use of the sectarian and tribal\nloyalties to maintain power. The \ufffdAlawi minority controls Syria, East Bankers\ncontrol Jordan, Sunnis control Iraq, and Nejdis control Saudi Arabia. This has\ndirect implications for the military, where sectarian considerations affect\nassignments and promotions. Some minorities (such the Circassians in Jordan or\nthe Druze in Syria) tie their well-being to the ruling elite and perform\ncritical protection roles; others (such as the Shi\ufffda of Iraq) are excluded\nfrom the officer corps. In any case, the assignment of officers based on\nsectarian considerations works against assignments based on merit.\n\nThe same lack of trust operates at the interstate level, where Arab armies\nexhibit very little trust of each other, and with good reason. The blatant lie\nGamal Abdel Nasser told King Husayn in June 1967 to get him into the war\nagainst Israel--that the Egyptian air force was over Tel Aviv (when most of\nits planes had been destroyed)--was a classic example of deceit. _27 Sadat\ufffds\ndisingenuous approach to the Syrians to entice them to enter the war in\nOctober 1973 was another (he told them that the Egyptians were planning total\nwar, a deception which included using a second set of operational plans\nintended only for Syrian eyes). _28 With this sort of history, it is no wonder\nthat there is very little cross or joint training among Arab armies and very\nfew command exercises. During the 1967 war, for example, not a single\nJordanian liaison officer was stationed in Egypt, nor were the Jordanians\nforthcoming with the Egyptian command. _29\n\nThird, Middle Eastern rulers routinely rely on balance-of-power techniques to\nmaintain their authority. _30 They use competing organizations, duplicate\nagencies, and coercive structures dependent upon the ruler\ufffds whim. This makes\nbuilding any form of personal power base difficult, if not impossible, and\nkeeps the leadership apprehensive and off-balance, never secure in its careers\nor social position. The same applies within the military; a powerful chairman\nof the joint chiefs is inconceivable.\n\nJoint commands are paper constructs that have little actual function. Leaders\nlook at joint commands, joint exercises, combined arms, and integrated staffs\nvery cautiously for all Arab armies are a double-edged sword. One edge points\ntoward the external enemy and the other toward the capital. The land forces\nare at once a regime-maintenance force and threat at the same time. No Arab\nruler will allow combined operations or training to become routine; the usual\nexcuse is financial expense, but that is unconvincing given their frequent\npurchase of hardware whose maintenance costs they cannot afford. In fact,\ncombined arms exercises and joint staffs create familiarity, soften rivalries,\nerase suspicions, and eliminate the fragmented, competing organizations that\nenable rulers to play off rivals against one another. This situation is most\nclearly seen in Saudi Arabia, where the land forces and aviation are under the\nminister of defense, Prince Sultan, while the National Guard is under Prince\nAbdullah, the deputy prime minister and crown prince. In Egypt, the Central\nSecurity Forces balance the army. In Iraq and Syria, the Republican Guard does\nthe balancing.\n\nPoliticians actually create obstacles to maintain fragmentation. For example,\nobtaining aircraft from the air force for army airborne training, whether it\nis a joint exercise or a simple administrative request for support of\ntraining, must generally be coordinated by the heads of services at the\nministry of defense; if a large number of aircraft are involved, this probably\nrequires presidential approval. Military coups may be out of style, but the\nfear of them remains strong. Any large-scale exercise of land forces is a\nmatter of concern to the government and is closely observed, particularly if\nlive ammunition is being used. In Saudi Arabia a complex system of clearances\nrequired from area military commanders and provincial governors, all of whom\nhave differing command channels to secure road convoy permission, obtaining\nammunition, and conducting exercises, means that in order for a coup to work,\nit would require a massive amount of loyal conspirators. Arab regimes have\nlearned how to be coup-proof.\n\nSecurity and Paranoia\n\nArab regimes classify virtually everything vaguely military. Information the\nU.S. military routinely publishes (about promotions, transfers, names of unit\ncommanders, and unit designations) is top secret in Arabic-speaking countries.\nTo be sure, this does make it more difficult for the enemy to construct an\naccurate order of battle, but it also feeds the divisive and compartmentalized\nnature of the military forces. The obsession with security can reach ludicrous\nlengths. Prior to the 1973 war, Sadat was surprised to find that within two\nweeks of the date he had ordered the armed forces be ready for war, his\nminister of war, General Muhammad Sadiq, had failed to inform his immediate\nstaff of the order. Should a war, Sadat wondered, be kept secret from the very\npeople expected to fight it? _31 One can expect to have an Arab counterpart or\nkey contact to be changed without warning and with no explanation as to his\nsudden absence. This might well be simply a transfer a few doors down the way,\nbut the vagueness of it all leaves foreigners with dire scenarios--scenarios\nthat might be true. And it is best not to inquire too much; advisors or\ntrainers who seem overly inquisitive may find their access to host military\ninformation or facilities limited.\n\nThe presumed close U.S.-Israel relationship, thought to be operative at all\nlevels, aggravates and complicates this penchant for secrecy. Arabs believe\nthat the most mundane details about them are somehow transmitted to the Mossad\nvia a secret hotline. This explains why a U.S. advisor with Arab forces is\nlikely to be asked early and often about his opinion of the \ufffdPalestine\nproblem,\ufffd then subjected to monologues on the presumed Jewish domination of\nthe United States.\n\nIndeference to Safety\n\nIn terms of safety measures, there is a general laxness, a seeming\ncarelessness and indifference to training accidents, many of which could have\nbeen prevented by minimal efforts. To the (perhaps overly) safety-conscious\nAmericans, Arab societies appear indifferent to casualties and show a\nseemingly lackadaisical approach to training safety. There are a number of\nexplanations for this. Some would point to the inherent fatalism within Islam,\n_32 and certainly anyone who has spent considerable time in Arab taxis would\nlend credence to that theory, but perhaps the reason is less religiously based\nand more a result of political culture. As any military veteran knows, the\nethos of a unit is set at the top; or, as the old saying has it, units do\nthose things well that the boss cares about. When the top political leadership\ndisplays a complete lack of concern for the welfare of its soldiers, such\nattitudes percolate down through the ranks. Exhibit A was the betrayal of\nSyrian troops fighting Israel in the Golan in 1967: having withdrawn its elite\nunits, the Syrian government knowingly broadcast the falsehood that Israeli\ntroops had captured the town of Kuneitra, which would have put them behind the\nlargely conscript Syrian army still in position. The leadership took this step\nto pressure the great powers to impose a truce, though it led to a panic by\nthe Syrian troops and the loss of the Golan Heights. _33\n\nConclusion\n\nIt would be difficult to exaggerate the cultural gulf separating American and\nArab military cultures. In every significant area, American military advisors\nfind students who enthusiastically take in their lessons and then resolutely\nfail to apply them. The culture they return to--the culture of their own\narmies in their own countries--defeats the intentions with which they took\nleave of their American instructors.\n\nWhen they had an influence on certain Arab military establishments, the\nSoviets reinforced their clients\ufffd cultural traits far more than, in more\nrecent years, Americans were able to do. Like the Arabs\ufffd, the Soviets\ufffd\nmilitary culture was driven by political fears bordering on paranoia. The\nsteps taken to control the sources (real or imagined) of these fears, such as\na rigidly centralized command structure, were readily understood by Arab\npolitical and military elites. The Arabs, too, felt an affinity for the Soviet\nofficer class\ufffds contempt for ordinary soldiers and the Soviet military\nhierarchy\ufffds distrust of a well-developed, well-appreciated, well-rewarded NCO\ncorps.\n\nArab political culture is based on a high degree of social stratification,\nvery much like that of the defunct Soviet Union and very much unlike the\nupwardly mobile, meritocratic, democratic United States. Arab officers do not\nsee any value in sharing information among themselves, let alone with their\nmen. In this they follow the example of their political leaders, who not only\nwithhold information from their own allies, but routinely deceive them.\nTraining in Arab armies reflects this: rather than prepare as much as possible\nfor the multitude of improvised responsibilities that are thrown up in the\nchaos of battle, Arab soldiers, and their officers, are bound in the narrow\nfunctions assigned them by their hierarchy. That this renders them less\neffective on the battlefield, let alone places their lives at greater risk, is\nscarcely of concern, whereas, of course, these two issues are dominant in the\nAmerican military culture, and are reflected in American military training.\n\nChange is unlikely to come until it occurs in the larger Arab political\nculture, although the experience of other societies (including our own)\nsuggests that the military can have a democratizing influence on the larger\npolitical culture, as officers bring the lessons of their training first into\ntheir professional environment, then into the larger society. It obviously\nmakes a big difference, however, when the surrounding political culture is not\nonly avowedly democratic (as are many Middle Eastern states), but functionally\nso. Until Arab politics begin to change at fundamental levels, Arab armies,\nwhatever the courage or proficiency of individual officers and men, are\nunlikely to acquire the range of qualities which modern fighting forces\nrequire for success on the battlefield. For these qualities depend on\ninculcating respect, trust, and openness among the members of the armed forces\nat all levels, and this is the marching music of modern warfare that Arab\narmies, no matter how much they emulate the corresponding steps, do not want\nto hear.\n\nEndnotes\n\n*: This article is reprinted with permission from Middle East Quarterly, Vol. 4, No. 4 (December 1999) Back.\n\n**: Norvell De Atkine is a retired U.S. army colonel.
