It is turned\non through the DuckDuckGo browser so a second app is not required, and it does\nfilter traffic through all apps and browsers.\n\nDuckDuckGo's personal information removal tool regularly scans 50 sites that\nsell information, such as Spokeo. Personal information is stored on device,\nand removal requests are initiated using the information provided during\nsetup. The process is automated, and there is a dashboard to monitor results.\n\nIdentity theft restoration includes the support of a dedicated advisor that\nwill work with users to restore stolen accounts, replace bank cards and other\nidentifying documents, recover financial losses, and correct credit reports.\n\nPrivacy Pro from DuckDuckGo is priced at $9.99 per month or $99.99 per year,\nand it is currently only available in the United States. Users will need to\nensure they are using the latest version of the DuckDuckGo browser to take\nadvantage of the features.\n\nTag: DuckDuckGo\n\n[ 80 comments ]\n\n## Top Rated Comments\n\ncraigatkinson\n\n14 hours ago at 01:09 pm\n\n> 1) Get people to fear the internet 2) Sell a product to keep people safe on\n> the internet 3) Profit\n\n1) Get people to trust the internet. 2) Sell a product built on that trust. 3)\nProfit off of betraying that trust.\n\nScore: 22 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nJippaLippa\n\n15 hours ago at 12:47 pm\n\nI was thinking of getting onboard with one of these data removal service,\nstill I can't decide which one.
