We have long said\nthat this is the wrong approach to supporting journalism. If passed, CJPA may\nresult in significant changes to the services we can offer Californians and\nthe traffic we can provide to California publishers.\n\nBy helping people find news stories, we help publishers of all sizes grow\ntheir audiences at no cost to them. CJPA would up-end that model. It would\nfavor media conglomerates and hedge funds\u2014who\u2019ve been lobbying for this\nbill\u2014and could use funds from CJPA to continue to buy up local California\nnewspapers, strip them of journalists, and create more ghost papers that\noperate with a skeleton crew to produce only low-cost, and often low-quality,\ncontent. CJPA would also put small publishers at a disadvantage and limit\nconsumers\u2019 access to a diverse local media ecosystem.\n\nAs we\u2019ve shared when other countries have considered similar proposals, the\nuncapped financial exposure created by CJPA would be unworkable. If enacted,\nCJPA in its current form would create a level of business uncertainty that no\ncompany could accept. To prepare for possible CJPA implications, we are\nbeginning a short-term test for a small percentage of California users. The\ntesting process involves removing links to California news websites,\npotentially covered by CJPA, to measure the impact of the legislation on our\nproduct experience. Until there\u2019s clarity on California\u2019s regulatory\nenvironment, we\u2019re also pausing further investments in the California news\necosystem, including new partnerships through Google News Showcase, our\nproduct and licensing program for news organizations, and planned expansions\nof the Google News Initiative.\n\n## A better approach\n\nTo be clear, we believe CJPA undermines news in California. We don\u2019t take\nthese decisions lightly and want to be transparent with California publishers,\nlawmakers, and our users. To avoid an outcome where all parties lose and the\nCalifornia news industry is left worse off, we urge lawmakers to take a\ndifferent approach.\n\nFor more than two decades, we\u2019ve provided substantial support to help news\npublishers navigate the changing digital landscape and innovate. We\u2019ve rolled\nout Google News Showcase, which operates in 26 countries, including the U.S.,\nand has more than 2,500 participating publications. Through the Google News\nInitiative we\u2019ve partnered with more than 7,000 news publishers around the\nworld, including 200 news organizations and 6,000 journalists in California\nalone.\n\nThese investments in the news ecosystem are geared towards helping journalists\nand news publishers evolve in response to the rapidly changing way people are\nlooking for and consuming information. It\u2019s well known that people are getting\nnews from sources like short-form video, topical newsletters, social media,\nand curated podcasts, and many are avoiding the news entirely. In line with\nthose trends, just 2% of queries on Google Search are news-related.\nNevertheless, we want to continue making targeted contributions to the news\necosystem to help news publishers navigate this inflection point. CJPA as\ncurrently constructed would end these investments.\n\nWe\u2019ve been engaging with California publishers and lawmakers throughout the\nlegislative process and have proposed reasonable and balanced alternatives to\nCJPA. A healthy news industry in California will require support from both the\nCalifornia government and a broad base of private companies. This support\nshould involve predictable, broad-based contributions, structured in ways that\ndo not harm smaller, local publishers to benefit the largest players and hedge\nfund owners. It must also maintain the principles of the open web, which is\ncritical to ensuring news publishers can connect with people for free.\n\nLooking ahead, we will continue our efforts to work with lawmakers on\nalternative paths that will allow us to continue linking to news and\nsupporting the news ecosystem in California.\n\nPOSTED IN:\n\n###\n\nRelated stories\n\n  * Public Policy\n\n#### How Android and Google Play drive global growth\n\nNew research shows Android and Google Play help contribute to economic growth,\nsmall business success and more.\n\nBy Government Affairs and Public Policy Team\n\nApr 10, 2024\n\n  * Public Policy\n\n#### Our new report on AI's opportunity for developing countries\n\nBy Karan Bhatia\n\nApr 03, 2024\n\n  * News\n\n#### News Showcase is launching in Finland\n\nBy Jenny Feldhausen\n\nFeb 29, 2024\n\n  * News\n\n#### New funding, trainings and tools to help journalists\n\nBy Matt Cooke Yuval Shukroon\n\nFeb 01, 2024\n\n  * News\n\n#### News Showcase is launching in Bulgaria\n\nBy Elina Naydenova\n\nJan 24, 2024\n\n  * Public Policy\n\n#### How Google is supporting repair and sensible right to repair legislation\n\nGoogle releases Right to Repair white paper\n\nBy Steven Nickel\n\nJan 11, 2024\n\n  * .\n\nLet\u2019s stay in touch.
