He wants anyone, anywhere to\nhave access to humanity's backlog of knowledge, built up throughout millennia.\nOpenAI\u2019s product, he says, is not ChatGPT but \u201cmagic intelligence in the sky.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s rather ironic, then, that humans are using the awesome AI tools his\ncompany and others like Google or Meta are building to do stuff that hardly\nqualifies as smart: create spam farm sites, flood existing sites with fake\nads, or replace them with AI-generated garbage; cheat by outsourcing homework;\nand the worst use case, generate fake people and fake porn with real people.\n\nTwisting information in batches to saturate the channels of distribution is\nsuper cheap now. It\u2019s possible to make deepfake media in a personalized way,\nat scale. Passing written exams\u2014even those of elite universities\u2014is trivial\nwith GPT-4. Attacking someone\u2019s public image, like an ex or a celebrity, is a\nfew clicks away. The reputation of political figures and the capacity of our\npolitical system to handle the disinformation challenge will be heavily tested\nin the upcoming elections.\n\nAllow me now to make the caveat you\u2019re waiting for: That\u2019s not all we do. I am\nsure you, like myself, aren\u2019t one of them. We\u2019re learning new things, teaching\nin new ways, building new tools, creating new artistic styles and techniques,\nand exploring new productivity-boosting practices for work. But we\u2019re\nexceptions to the norm. The most common uses for this gift we\u2019ve been given\nare spamming, cheating, and faking.\n\nWe are not them but they are part of us\u2014of the AI community which the world\nsees as a monolith. Sadly, as the evidence I\u2019ve provided suggests, a\nmajoritarian part indeed\u2014if not in number in the level of noise. Ignoring this\nfact is to put a blindfold on your eyes. You decide. The rest of the world\nalready has.\n\nIt\u2019s not the fault of the tools or the companies spearheading ChatGPT-like\nproducts; our use is our responsibility. The culprit is the human condition,\nwhich explains the prevalence of these use cases but doesn\u2019t excuse them at\nall. We pride ourselves as the most intelligent species but our simplest,\ndumbest instincts drive us still.\n\nAs a result, AI is taking to zero not the cost of intelligence but the cost of\ntransforming those instincts into bullshit. Generative AI is the first\ntechnology ever to be used primarily for BaaS: Bullshit as a Service.\n\n##\n\nA gift for the undeserving\n\nIn October I published an essay against elitism and in defense of the\n\u201cdemocratization of creative freedom,\u201d as Vauhini Vara referred to the\npossibility that everyone had access to the wonders of writing well through\nAI.\n\nIt was a hard piece for me; I experienced an inner struggle between what I\nthought was right\u2014that everyone should be able to write well\u2014and what I wanted\nto be right\u2014that good writing deserves a singular place in the Museum of Human\nGenius and then should be a reward, not a gift.\n\nProviding people with the means to write \u201cthe book of their dreams,\u201d as\nElizabeth Ann West says, is a pursuit so genuinely noble that I can\u2019t see how\nanyone would stand against it. I still stand by that part. But I can\u2019t agree\nwith the rest of my thesis.\n\nThe reason is not that I\u2019m an elitist gatekeeper\u2014that I want the ability to\nwrite well to remain exclusive to a few brilliant authors\u2014but that the\ndemocratization of creative freedom, although nice-sounding on paper, is the\ndelusion of an idealist. At least for now.\n\nThe world is not prepared for it. I dare to say we\u2019re not made for it.\n\nThose who truly, deeply want creative freedom just go for it. They put no\nexcuses. They don\u2019t let resistance get in their way. Those who want to write\nthe book of their dreams will try their hardest to get it done.\n\nThose who are given the gift of creative freedom without wanting it\u2014unwilling\nto fight to achieve it\u2014will use it for other much less laudable purposes.\n\nI wrote that essay from a \u201chow the world should be\u201d bubble without attending\nto how it is. How many people want to write the book of their dreams actually?\nA few people, like West argues, probably want that freedom genuinely but can\u2019t\nachieve it despite trying hard. Such cases are not unheard of. But fully\noutsourcing the effort and the experience of writing your dream book to an AI\nis a maddening oxymoron.\n\nI don\u2019t need to resort to arguments about how these tools are created by\nstealing the non-credited and non-compensated work of others (which is true),\nor the limitations of ChatGPT to write novels (which is true), I just have to\nlook at the world as it is.\n\nEven if AI writing tools were created ethically and people could input a\nsentence and obtain a whole novel in return, most wouldn\u2019t use that superpower\nto write the book of their dreams. This realization is powerful once you\ninternalize it. We\u2019re just not like that. The majority would use it to earn\nmoney quickly or minimize the effort it takes to do their job.\n\nThe democratization of creative freedom is an honorable goal. But the people\nwho respect that\u2014who care about democracy and creativity and freedom are those\nwho want to develop the skills themselves\u2014are those willing to fight for them.\nThe main beneficiaries of that gift, it seems, are precisely the ones who\ndon\u2019t respect it.\n\nIt\u2019s a gift for the undeserving.\n\nShould we still pursue our ideals in a far-from-ideal world filled with people\nwho don\u2019t respect them? Perhaps it\u2019s a matter of adapting to the new\ntechnology and learning to combine it with our love for creativity.\n\nFor now, however, I\u2019m not willing to keep defending the eroding of creative\nmastery\u2014and the effort and work it takes\u2014to give an undeserved gift to those\nwho are not willing to acknowledge the giants on whose shoulders they stand.\n\n##\n\nThe ape who understood the universe\n\nTechnology and innovation prompt us to imagine worrying future scenarios. It\u2019s\nour nature. We are not afraid of AI, we are afraid of everything. Not because\neverything is dangerous but because if we can think of it, and can\u2019t disregard\nit as impossible, then uncertainty will capture our minds.\n\nThat\u2019s where AI risk narratives are born. However, as it\u2019s apparent from the\nmore common applications of generative AI, reality tells a different story:\nthe distribution of possibilities converges on the mundane.\n\nAI, at the extremes, is either a vector for a post-scarcity world or a vector\nof catastrophic destruction yet the primary use we\u2019re giving it seems to be\nfor the most prosaic, simplistic, and dumb stuff. AI, Apocalypse of doomers;\nPromethean fire of boosters... no, it\u2019s just BaaS.\n\nWhat I see here is the reflection of a tragic tale\u2014the curse and blessing of\nhumanity.\n\nWe are a species of intelligent beings capable of bending the laws of nature\nto our will and transforming energy to propel ourselves through the universe\nboth figuratively and literally.\n\nWe believe ourselves to be so complex yet are actually so simple. We are the\napes who understood the universe\u2014from an invisible prison. We keep extending\nour arms high up in the air, reaching ever further, but our feet won\u2019t leave\nthe ground.\n\nWe remain, despite our prowess, unable to escape the most primal, basic drives\nthat inevitably remind us that although we may be able to witness the stars\nfrom afar\u2014and see that magic intelligence in the sky\u2014we were not made to touch\nthem.\n\n86\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Generative AI, Bullshit as a Service\n\nwww.thealgorithmicbridge.com\n\n55\n\nShare\n\n55 Comments\n\nBirgitte RasineThe MuseFeb 7Liked by Alberto RomeroAnd you know, of course,\nthat any time we hear someone claim they're building tech to give the gift of\ndemocracy (whether in art, politics, or knowledge) to humanity, if you squint\njust a little you'll see the glint of dollar signs... and the electric sizzle\nof power.
