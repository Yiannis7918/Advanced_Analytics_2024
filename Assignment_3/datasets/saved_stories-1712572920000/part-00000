Affiliates skyrocket growth of an AI startup\n\n  2. How many accounts does a single Onlyfans model own?\n\n  3. A tool to go down the rabbit hole of Reddit\n\n  4. One recommended video on how to win\n\nAn AI Startup used these growth hacks in the 1st AI Wave (text-to-text) to\ngrow incredibly fast.\n\nThe 2nd AI Wave (text-to-image) used a few different hacks that we\u2019ll cover\nlater.\n\nBut, the 3rd AI Wave (ai agents) is upon us.\n\nYou can copy the playbook laid out here if you\u2019re building for the 3rd wave.\n\n## 1\\. Affiliate marketing\n\nAffiliate marketing works if you help affiliates make a lot of money through a\ngenerous referral plan. Incentives rule the world. And money is a powerful\nincentive.\n\nCopy AI's best move was to give a really generous affiliate plan. They gave\naway 45% on every referral for a year.\n\nLet's say you bring them 10 referrals. They are gonna pay you $49 x 45% x 10 =\n$49 x 4.5 = $220.5/mo.\n\nCopy AI affiliate program source: https://affiliates.copy.ai/apply\n\nThis allowed everyone on Twitter go crazy by sharing their affiliate links to\nmake money. Even today people share it if you search for copy.ai?via= on\ntwitter.\n\nCopy AI affiliates sharing their affiliate url on twitter to make some money\n\nMind you, the first link doesn't look like copy.ai because they are using a\nurl shortener. when you click on that link, it goes to copy.ai?via= url.\n\nLots of youtubers made videos on copy ai spamming affiliate links everywhere\nto the point where people were complaining about it asking \"how legit the tool\nis?\" on blackhatworld forums.\n\nCopy AI affiliates sharing their affiliate url by making youtube videos\n\nThey probably contacted specific youtube influencers in the copywriting niche\nto make videos on it.\n\nTheir affiliate marketing strategy was soo good that I kept seeing it in\nforums like blackhatworld & other not-so-well-known places on the internet.\n\n## 2\\. Yearly Pricing by Default\n\nYearly plan is switched on by default. You have to toggle a button to see the\nmonthly plan.\n\nYearly plan is priced at $35/month ($420/year) & monthly plan at $49/month.\n\nThis helped them reduce churn & make people used to the tool since they have\nalready paid for it a year.\n\nIt also gave them upfront cash to reinvest in marketing efforts till they\nraised vc money!\n\nyearly pricing source:\nhttps://twitter.com/chris__lu/status/1403114410982395906\n\n## 3\\. Do Good\n\nPositivity is contagious. Mr. Beast grows his YouTube channel by giving away\nfree stuff.\n\nCopy AI Founder did the same.\n\ncopy ai is free for non-profits source:\nhttps://twitter.com/PaulYacoubian/status/1384966950082777091\n\nThey gave many free accounts to students, non-profits & first-time\nentrepreneurs.\n\ncopy ai is free for non-profits source:\nhttps://twitter.com/PaulYacoubian/status/1384966950082777091\n\nThey extended the same courtesy to people who lost their jobs due to covid.\n\ncopy ai is free for the unemployed\n\n## 4\\. Product as Marketing\n\nThey kept launching again & again with fun tools like a .com domain finder & a\nmake more tool.\n\ncopy ai dot com domain tool source:\nhttps://twitter.com/PaulYacoubian/status/1349406675766276096\n\ncopy ai make more tool source:\nhttps://twitter.com/PaulYacoubian/status/1353031139854864390\n\nYou can see their free ai tools at copy.ai/tools.\n\nThey give away the tool for free, just like ahrefs, so users can try it\nthemselves & get a dopamine hit faster.\n\nsource: https://twitter.com/BrianNorgard/status/1316022238408175619\n\n## 5\\. Webinars with Influencers\n\nThey did webinars with influencers like pat flynn, the founder of smart\npassive income, to gain a portion of his audience.\n\nPat has 163k twitter followers, 290k youtube subscribers, & 6 businesses.\n\npat flynn webinar with copy ai source:\nhttps://superpeer.com/blake/event/webinar-grow-your-personal-brand-w-pat-flynn\n\nPat's audience got a 30-day free trial instead of a 7-day free trial & a\nwhopping 40% off of first year.\n\nspecial deal for pat flynn's audience source: https://www.copy.ai/spi\n\nWho doesn't want 40% off? This goes back to the yearly plan which helps in\nreducing churn & gives you a long-time to make yourself familiar with the\nproduct.\n\nThey did similar webinars with others as well.\n\n## Onlyfans is a volume game\n\nStartup boys get tired after marketing just 1 time to 100 people.\n\nBut not Onlyfans girls.\n\nThey use 10+ phones, multiple mobile proxies with anti-detect browsers like\nDolphin Anty, & operate 100s of aged-Reddit accounts while simultaneously\ninteracting with other models in their same niche like an engagement pod to\nget the upvotes party going.\n\nA short 12-second video on China's Click Farm. Exactly how you manipulate the\npublic on a massive scale to buy from you.\n\nThe best marketers operate in the adult niche. Learning from adjacent industry\nis such a game-changer. Not enough people do it.\n\nImagine SaaS boys marketed like Onlyfans girls operating 100s of Reddit\naccounts at the same time. It'll be so easy to get to $10k mrr by manipulating\nthe social media algorithm.\n\nEither you use Big Tech or the Big Tech uses you. Your choice.\n\n## A tool to go down the rabbit hole of Reddit\n\nAvanka's Sayit is a tool that allows you to go down the rabbit hole of Reddit\nwith a few searches.\n\nIt isn't updated for a long time so it has many banned subreddits but it works\nwell enough to find subreddits.\n\nIf you're an entrepreneur looking for subreddits to join, just search\n\"Entrepreneur\" at https://anvaka.github.io/sayit/\n\navanka sayit entrepreneur\n\nFor more inspiration, search for \"onlyfans\" to find onlyfans creator-related\nsubreddit, \"crypto\" to find crypto enthusiasts, \"programming\" to find coding\nsubreddits, \"chatgpt\" to find ai-related subreddits, or \"hollywood\" to find\nhollywood-related subreddits.\n\nReddit has niche subreddits for everything from \u201cfeet\u201d to \u201csaas\u201c.\n\n## Recommended video of the day\n\nThere is one YouTuber who has impressed me over the last 2 years since I found\nhim on April 2022 by accident. His name is Alex Hormozi. Probably the only guy\nwho I've watched more than Naval.\n\nHe's a philosopher, sales guy, businessman, teacher, & bodybuilder.\n\nHe has 2 incredible books that are must-read: $100m offers & $100m leads.\n\nAnd a mind-blowing YouTube channel.\n\nSo I'll recommend his video on how to win in 2024 to kickstart this\nnewsletter. Ignore the title as it doesn't do justice to how good the video\nis.\n\nThis newsletter is experimental so some stuff might change. Reply with which\npart of the newsletter you liked the most & which one you didn't.\n\nPS: If you need the entire 3000-word Copy AI marketing secrets, reply with\ncopy ai to this email. The original essay was written 2 years ago before Elon\nnuked search but I have a big list of 11 tips.\n\nUntil next time,\n\nYour Spells Maester!\n\n## Footer\n\n#### Startup Spells \ud83e\ude84\n\nStartup secrets they won't tell you\n\nHomePosts\n\n\u00a9 2024 Startup Spells \ud83e\ude84.\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTerms of Use\n\nPowered by beehiiv\n\n", "frontpage": false}
