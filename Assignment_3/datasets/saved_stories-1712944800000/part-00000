A year later Brazilians have taken to the streets to demand that\nthere be no amnesty for its perpetrators.\n\nThe Supreme Court effectively halted a coup attempt, designed to prevent\nelected president Lula da Silva from taking office, led by his defeated\nadversary Jair Bolsonaro, far-right generals and the former commander of the\nBrazilian navy. Only hesitance elsewhere in the Armed Forces prevented the\nsituation becoming far worse.\n\nIn the wake of Supreme Court investigation and prosecution of the key\nplotters, a new proto-coup is being fomented in the most resource-rich nation\non earth.\n\nIn early April 2024 Elon Musk-allied activist Michael D. Shellenberger\nlaunched \u201cTwitter Files Brazil\u201d. Billed as a bombshell leak it was in fact a\ntepid fantasy, built using cherry picked information from the company\u2019s own\nemails, misinterpretation of Brazilian law, and blatant journalistic\nmalpractice. These messages were reassembled, haphazardly, and in bad faith,\nto reach desired conclusions, and then spread by an army of far right flacks\nto generate maximum online repercussion, in an effort to intimidate both the\nSupreme Court and Lula administration.\n\nAs a measure of the publication\u2019s accuracy, what Shellenberger depicted as\nSupreme Court Minister Alexandre de Moraes\u2019 threat to arrest Twitter Brasil\u2019s\nlawyer was shown by UN advisor Estela Aranha to be actually a S\u00e3o Paulo police\ndemand for the personal information of a leader of the PCC organised crime\ngang.\n\n(Shellenberger later, and in Portuguese, admitted his \u201cmistake\u201d and apologized\nfor it, but not before the lie had circulated to millions who would never see\nhis admission.)\n\nNews had emerged that X/Twitter was part of Supreme Court investigations into\nJanuary 8, and so called Fake News inquiry. At time of writing it has been\nreported that telecoms regulator Anatel has already told operators to prepare\nfor formal removal of X/Twitter from Brazilian networks.\n\nThe resulting distractive wall of noise was intended to defend both Musk\u2019s\nbusiness interests, and the far right figures which now act as his Brazilian\nsentinels, such as arrest-threatened Jair Bolsonaro himself.\n\nShellenberger and other Musk outriders had attempted to build a narrative that\nBrazil is now an \u201cauthoritarian socialist dictatorship\u201d, on account of the\ninvestigation of January 8 coup plotters and demands that Twitter hand over\ntheir personal data to police and the court, as per Brazilian law. Free speech\nin Brazil is covered under what is called harmony of rights, similar to the\nGerman legal system. In arrogant colonial disregard of sovereignty, Musk and\nhis sycophantic cronies attempt to apply US first amendment style standards\nwhich do not exist in Brazil, as if the 1988 constitution, drafted to replace\na US supported dictatorship, has no worth whatsoever.\n\nIn a glaring double standard, Musk has complied with almost all government\ndemands in Modi\u2019s authoritarian India, making it very clear that \u201cfreedom of\nspeech\u201d is not the issue at all.\n\nA spurious \u201cAuthoritarian Brazil\u201d fantasy could well form the ideological\nbasis of, and manufacture consent for, the US supporting a future coup\nattempt, under Trump or other far right administration, the seeds of which are\nalready in place.\n\nThis use of the \u201cAuthoritarian Brazil\u201d narrative Musk is pushing to shape US\nforeign policy was demonstrated in reports by Agencia Publica that this March,\na delegation of Brazilian far right congresspeople, led by Eduardo Bolsonaro,\nwent to Washington D.C. in an effort to convince Republican lawmakers to\napprove US sanctions against Brazil. Their action, which is potentially\ntreasonous and an attack on national sovereignty, was blocked by Democratic\nRepresentative James P. McGovern.\n\nSenator Randolfe Rodrigues remarked: \u201cThe spoiled neo-fascist decided to\ndouble down and attack the President of the Republic. The goal is to have X\nsuspended in Brazil by judicial decision so he can cry censorship, encourage\nhatred, and foster attacks against our institutions\u201d.\n\nResearcher Nina Santos told Wired magazine: \u201cThey are trying to use Brazil as\na laboratory on how to interfere in local politics.\u201d\n\nFollow the Lithium\n\nAs Musk himself said regarding the US and UK backed antidemocratic attack on\nlithium rich Bolivia, \u201cWe will coup whoever we want\u201d.\n\nIn 2023 Chinese electric car manufacturer BYD, Tesla\u2019s main competitor,\nannounced the building of three factories in Brazil\u2019s north eastern Bahia\nstate.\n\nIt was then reported by the Financial Times in January that BYD was striking a\nsupply deal with Sigma Lithium, which Musk had allegedly been trying to\npurchase.\n\nJournalist Renato Souza reported: \u201cHours before Elon Musk\u2019s attacks against\nBrazil began, chief executive of Sigma Lithium, Rio de Janeiro native Ana\nCabral-Gardner, told Reuters that she will not sell company and that she\nintends to increase lithium production to 520k tons per year in 2025.\u201d\n\nThere are other business incentives for Musk in a pliant entreguista,\nBolsonaro-style government, besides lithium.\n\nTwo months prior to Musk\u2019s attacks it was announced that R$8bn government\ncontracts with his Starlink communication satellite system for use in schools,\nhastily drawn up before Bolsonaro left office, were now to be reviewed. Now\nthey are set to be cancelled with haste. Starlink equipment was earlier found\nto be being used by illegal miners in the Amazon, amid allegations that Musk\nhad been given information on mineral deposits in the region by the Bolsonaro\ngovernment, which it denied.\n\nLast but not least the Alcantara space base in Maranh\u00e3o state, hugely\nattractive for Space X launches, was offered to Musk in 2022 by Jair\nBolsonaro, in a proposed partnership which now seems highly improbable under\nthe Lula government.\n\nLegislation\n\nMusk\u2019s attacks have strengthened calls for regulation of social networks, and\nrevived legislative proposals for new laws against so called \u201cfake news\u201d of\nwhich \u201cTwitter Files Brazil\u201d is a prime example.\n\nThe biggest opponents of expanding legal controls on disinformation are of\ncourse the Brazilian far right, who, for example, have called to decriminalise\napologia for Naziism, such as the right to call for the creation of a\nBrazilian Nazi party. This is what US free speech absolutists are defending in\nBrazil.\n\nWithin this noise also lurks a dishonest false equivalency, to take far-right\noperation Lava Jato prosecutors using anti-constitutional and illegal lawfare\nstrategies as the basis for a coup and control of political outcomes, as they\ndid between 2014-2018, and equating with the Supreme Court now\nconstitutionally punishing those responsible for an attempted violent far\nright coup d\u2019etat.\n\nBut such is the maelstrom of compounded brain damage that Musk\u2019s X platform\nhas become nowadays, that many are falling for such fallacies.\n\nJournalist Brian Mier described Musk\u2019s campaign in terms of hybrid war,\nremarking that Brazil faced \u201ca QAnon-level psyop\u201d.\n\nGiven that the January 8 putschists planned to kidnap and possibly murder de\nMoraes as part of their January 8 coup attempt, you may forgive him for having\nskin in this game, but depiction of the minister as if \u201cLula\u2019s man\u201d is wildly\ninaccurate, given he was appointed by Bolsonaro\u2019s golpista predecessor, Michel\nTemer, following the death of Teori Zavascki, who himself was under far right\nattack for his skeptical approach to the malfeasance of Operation Lava Jato.\nMoraes predecessor Teori presented a risk to the plot, now proven, to jail\nLula and prevent him running in the 2018 election, and he was not part of the\ndiscredited, US orchestrated, anti corruption purge, as some Musk supporters\nhave wilfully misinterpreted.\n\nTucker Carlson favourite Glenn Greenwald, who has provided no insight or\nuseful analysis on Brazil for five years, has intervened on Musk\u2019s side and\nfed far-right conspiracy theories. Greenwald\u2019s attacks on de Moraes began\napproximately when the Supreme Court Minister became arch nemesis of then\npresident Bolsonaro and Lava Jato judge S\u00e9rgio Moro, Lula\u2019s jailer now\nimpeachment threatened senator. It was only then, during Bolsonaro\u2019s\ncatastrophic presidency, that Moraes gained supporters on the left as an\nunlikely anti fascist ally, despite being a right wing figure who had voted to\ndeny Lula Habeas Corpus thus removing him from the 2018 election race while\nfront runner, opening the way for Bolsonaro. It is easy to envisage him\nregretting that vote now, of course.\n\nYet to personalise it at all, as many are doing, even in de Moraes\u2019 defence,\nis to enter the fascists\u2019 rhetorical trap.\n\nIt is not an individual, but Brazil\u2019s democratic institutions that are under\nattack, as was the case on January 8 2023, and for which the perpetrators are\nbeing legally and rightfully prosecuted.\n\nThere is tragicomedy in seeing vocal supporters of the 1964-85 dictatorship,\nwhich tortured and disappeared countless opponents, exiled artists and\nmurdered journalists, now complaining about freedom of expression. They demand\nthe freedom to spread hatred, peddle disinformation, and to attack the very\ninstitutions which established their post dictatorship freedoms.\n\nIn addition, support for Musk in Brazil is one of the purest and most pathetic\nexpressions of Viralatismo, or stray dog complex, ever observed. This plays\nperfectly into his inherently racist white saviour self image. The gringo\nknows best.\n\nHowever, many if not most Brazilians expressed a desire to see Musk punished.\n\nVeteran journalist Jamil Chade wrote: \u201cElon Musk is a threat to democracy. In\nan orchestrated plan with the far right, he corrupts the term \u201cfreedom\u201d in\norder to open the door for the right to do harm, to hate, to discriminate and\nto oppress. The corollary of this \u201cabsolutism\u201d is the legitimation of\nviolence.\u201d whilst popular commentator and influencer Felipe Neto went for the\nthroat: \u201cF*ck you Elon Musk. You have no idea what we\u2019re facing here and how\nclose we came to having a state coup in our country ESPECIALLY because of the\nconspiracy theorists and neofascists assh*les you\u2019re trying to protect at all\ncosts. I hope Twitter shuts down in Brazil while you own it\u201d\n\nAmid the ensuing backlash, Musk, with all the geopolitical imagination of an\neleven year old, posted an AI generated image of himself standing heroically\nbefore Brazil\u2019s flag, claiming that \u201cthe Brazilian people are behind him\u201d.\n\nPushback\n\nIn the days prior to Musk attacks, an Oliver Stuenkel article in Foriegn\nPolicy fed far right conspiracy theories that the CIA were somehow behind\nLula\u2019s election. On the contrary, it was behind his jailing and Bolsonaro\u2019s\nelection, something Stuenkel and his like have never acknowledged. Such\ninversion of reality is becoming commonplace.\n\nNaive assumptions that the Biden administration would oppose Bolsonaro for\nanything other than his direct connection to Trump, exposes the probability\nthat a less embarrassing far right president, such as S\u00e3o Paulo governor\nTarcisio, would be entirely palatable to DEM and GOP alike. The Biden\nadministration sent multiple delegations to visit Bolsonaro and normalise\nrelations prior to the 2022 election, which they then publicly insisted would\nbe free and fair.\n\nLawyer and analyst Walfrido Warde of the nonpartisan IREE think tank remarked:\n\u201cNo one becomes the owner of a spaceship factory and social networks without\nthe authorization or determination of the North American military-industrial\ncomplex and intelligence system, which thrive on the chaos among us, with the\nconfusion that limits and delays the our development, like the clashes between\nBrazilian political groups, which insist on diverging instead of converging\nfor the good of the country. \u201cThey\u201d want us to be eternal providers of natural\nresources at a bargain price. And we, bovinely, accept it.\u201d\n\nMusk\u2019s moves are no gaffe, and need to be viewed in the context of a far right\npushback in Latin America, whose front facing activity is conducted via\nprivate entities but ultimately serves US and North Atlantic allies resource\ninterests regardless.\n\nThey call it \u201cletting others lead\u201d and it isn\u2019t new; after all US Business\nbankrolled Brazil\u2019s 1964 coup via the nascent Council of the Americas, and\nduring 2013-18 it the likes of Koch\u2019s Atlas Network and US hedge funds\nchanneling dollars to far right golpista activists and organisations.\n\nBut even as the social media storm in Brazil raged, Council of the Americas\u2019\nown Eric Farnsworth called for COA member X/Twitter to ban Venezuelan\nPresident Nicolas Maduro from the platform, with almost zero repercussion.\nFreedom of speech, again evidently no issue. Also absent is any comparison\nbetween Brazilian Supreme Court calling for X/Twitter compliance and\naccountability, and US efforts to force Chinese competitor TikTok\u2019s sale to a\nUS company in \u201cdefence of democracy\u201d. Other countries are evidently expected\nto welcome the manic whims of US tech oligarchs with guns trained on their\ndemocracies.\n\nMeanwhile the Biden administration can plant feel good stories about how they\nhelped avert a coup in Brazil, having orchestrated the rise to power of the\nregime it was defending, and with the seeds of another already planted.\n\n\u00a9 2024 BRASILWIRE\n\nPowered by WordPress\n\nTo the top \u2191 Up \u2191\n\n", "frontpage": false}
