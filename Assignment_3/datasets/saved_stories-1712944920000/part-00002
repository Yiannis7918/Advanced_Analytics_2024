We\noften cringe at the thought of having people just sit there, saying nothing.\nThe impulse therefore\u2014especially as a team leader\u2014is to intervene; to break\nthe silence.\n\nDon't.\n\n### The Dependency Trap\n\nThe influential English psychoanalyst Wilfred Bion saw that groups tend to\nhave underlying tendencies (he called them \"basic assumptions\") that hinder a\ngroup's ability to reach its goals. He called one of these assumptions\n\"dependency\"\u2014a dynamic in which the group members behave passively, expecting\nthe leader to make all the decisions and \"take care\" of them. An example of\nthis dynamic is when the leader poses a question to the team, only to be met\nby docile silence.\n\n### Why Silence Can Be Good\n\nAs a team leader, being the one to fill every silent moment creates an\nenvironment which fosters \"dependency\". The group becomes accustomed to the\nmanager calling all the shots, and gradually relinquishes more and more\ncontrol to him or her. The team becomes less effective, and struggles to\nfunction when the manager is not around.\n\n## Empowering Your Team: Strategies for Leaders\n\n  1. ### Talk Less, Listen More\n\nLet the team marinate a bit in uncomfortable silence. Don't try to jump in and\nsave them. In time, this will empower them to speak, and be able to act\nindependently of you. At first they will do it to break the silence, but\neventually it'll just become the new normal\u2014they will learn that their voices\nare as valuable as yours.\n\n  2. ### Let Others Shine\n\nLet others speak, even when you think you know the answer. Firstly, you'll\nsometimes find out that you, in fact, did not know the answer. But even when\nyou do, having someone else propose it will serve two functions: you've raised\nsomeone else's profile, and you've acquired an ally. Both will help the group\nmake better decisions, especially in the long term.\n\n  3. ### Embrace Change and Pushback\n\nModel accepting pushback and changing your mind. The team needs to see that\nthem talking and disagreeing with you is not just for show. If you want the\ngroup to not be dependent on you, they need to see that their opinions matter.\nOne of the best ways to ensure that they do, is to be persuaded by them. If\nyou propose one thing, a team member proposes another, and hers is the one\naccepted, you've shown the group that you value a good decision being made\nmore than you value being right.\n\n  4. ### Empower Decision Making\n\nAllow others to have the final word. As managers, it's tempting for us to\nbookmark every discussion. Being the one to close each conversation can be\nseen as a sign of strength\u2014having the final word makes the decision yours, in\na sense. Avoid this temptation. Enable others on the team to be the ones to\nconclude a discussion. You'll empower the group to make decisions in your\nabsence, and you'll witness new leaders emerge.\n\nThere are other ways to avoid the \"dependency\" trap, but they all begin with\nspeaking less, listening more, and embracing the silence.\n\n### Forter Engineering\n\nFollow us on social media to stay up-to-date with cutting edge technologies,\n\n", "frontpage": false}
