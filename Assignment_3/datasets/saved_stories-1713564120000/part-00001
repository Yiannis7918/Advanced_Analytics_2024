This comprehensive approach ensures all cloud usage is\nauthorized, minimizing shadow IT. In addition, cloud security and operations\nplay an essential role in maintaining and refining governance frameworks.\n\nIn a LinkedIn post, Stephen Sumner, a senior content developer (Patterns &\npractices) at Microsoft, writes:\n\n> To control the cloud, you set up guardrails that allow for productive\n> freedom but prevent the bad stuff. Guardrails are the policies, procedures,\n> and tools you use to enforce control. With guardrails up, you're free to\n> focus on using the cloud to reach business goals.\n\nAccording to the company, the updated governance guidance in the CAF\nincorporates insights from customer experiences and recent technological\nadvancements to present a streamlined, proven approach to cloud governance.\nThese revisions offer several benefits, like a single, five-step process to\nestablish and maintain cloud governance over time, including a checklist that\noutlines every task in that process.\n\nOverview of the five-step process (Source: Tech Community blog post)\n\nIn addition, the guidance includes references and links to Azure tools and\nservices that facilitate cloud governance, as well as examples of cloud\ngovernance documentation and recommendations for gathering the correct\ngovernance data, for instance, for the raci matrix. Finally, the company also\nupdated the Cloud Governance assessment. This tool helps customers identify\nand address gaps in their cloud governance strategy and directs them to the\nrelevant guidance in the new guidance to fix those gaps.\n\nThe other cloud companies, AWS and Google, also offer governance guidance in\ntheir respective cloud adoption frameworks. Customers can find them in the\nGoogle Cloud Adoption whitepaper and AWS CAF governance sections.\nAdditionally, there are other cloud governance frameworks available, such as\nNIST Cloud Computing Framework, SOC2, and Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) STAR.\n\nWhen asked how the new governance guidance can help address challenges in\norganizations facing challenges in areas such as AI and data governance,\nSumner told InfoQ:\n\n> The new guidance includes examples showing how Azure can facilitate cloud\n> governance across common categories to accelerate organizations' adoption of\n> cloud governance. The guidance provides examples of regulatory compliance,\n> cost, security, resource management, operations, data, and artificial\n> intelligence (AI).\n>\n> These examples offer a sample starting point for organizations looking to\n> implement cloud governance in these categories of cloud governance. These\n> are not the only categories relevant to cloud governance, but they are some\n> of the most common. Given their rising importance, the data and AI\n> governance examples expand the scope of the previous guidance and provide\n> valuable and timely direction for many businesses.\n\nLastly, more details on the Microsoft Adoption Framework are available on the\nMicrosoft Learn documentation pages.\n\n## About the Author\n\n#### Steef-Jan Wiggers\n\nSteef-Jan Wiggers is one of InfoQ's senior cloud editors and works as an\nIntegration Architect at i8c in The Netherlands.
