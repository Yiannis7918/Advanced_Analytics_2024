Often, it is hard to tell if a method is better\n> than another or just better tuned. Tuning curves fix this ambiguity by\n> accounting for tuning effort. Specifically, they plot validation performance\n> as a function of the number of hyperparameter choices tried so far. While\n> several estimators exist for these curves, it is common to use point\n> estimates, which we show fail silently and give contradictory results when\n> given too little data. Beyond point estimates, confidence bands are\n> necessary to rigorously establish the relationship between different\n> approaches. We present the first method to construct valid confidence bands\n> for tuning curves. The bands are exact, simultaneous, and distribution-free,\n> thus they provide a robust basis for comparing methods. Empirical analysis\n> shows that while bootstrap confidence bands, which serve as a baseline, fail\n> to approximate their target confidence, ours achieve it exactly. We validate\n> our design with ablations, analyze the effect of sample size, and provide\n> guidance on comparing models with our method. To promote confident\n> comparisons in future work, we release opda: an easy-to-use library that you\n> can install with pip. this https URL\n\nComments:| Accepted to NAACL 2024. 18 pages, 20 figures  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Machine\nLearning (stat.ML)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2311.09480 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2311.09480v2 [cs.CL] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2311.09480arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Nicholas Lourie [view email] [v1] Thu, 16 Nov 2023 00:50:37 UTC (877 KB)\n[v2] Mon, 8 Apr 2024 18:21:53 UTC (1,101 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Show Your Work with Confidence: Confidence\nBands for Tuning Curves, by Nicholas Lourie and 2 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2311\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.LG stat stat.ML\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
