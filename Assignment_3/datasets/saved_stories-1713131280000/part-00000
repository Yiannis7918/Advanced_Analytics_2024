It's a\nthing that annoys me once a year and makes me happy once a year. I never gave\nit much more thought than that, other than to kind of vaguely think that it\nseemed pretty stupid, and having the impression that this was a commonly held\nbelief.\n\nA few weeks ago, I read Craig's weeknotes, where he wrote:\n\n> My social feeds have been full of people grumbling about daylight savings,\n> and that\u2019s set to kick off again next week when UK clocks change. But I love\n> it. (The clocks changing \u2013 not the grumbling.) In an instant, we\u2019ll go from\n> sunset around 18:30 to 19:30, meaning I\u2019ll be able to start playing football\n> in the street with my daughter after dinner again.\"\n\nThis actually got me wondering what the real impact of daylight saving time\nwas. A quick search led me to SunriseSunset.io, a super cool website that\nprovides a free API that returns sunset and sunrise times for any location on\nearth. So I wrote some code to visualize the effect of daylight saving time at\nmy location.\n\nHere it is:\n\nFrom top to bottom, this shows the daylight for each day. You can clearly see\nwhen daylight saving time becomes active, and when we switch back to standard\ntime. The blue areas on either side are the times when I'm typically asleep.\n\nAt least in my location for my sleep pattern, daylight saving time makes\nsense. I gain some light in the evening without losing any in the morning.\n\nHowever, standard time doesn't seem to make a lot of sense. It would be more\nsensible for daylight saving time to be used for the whole year. I now lose\nsome morning light because I sleep through it. By keeping daylight saving time\nall year, I would get that lost light back in the evenings. The only cost\nwould be very dark mornings around the winter solstice.\n\nIf you want to see a graph like this for your location and your sleep pattern,\ngo to ignorethecode.net/dst and see for yourself.^1 You need to give the page\naccess to your location for it to work. If you get an error, try again in a\nfew minutes. And if you find this useful, buy the guy who made the API a\ncoffee.\n\n  1. Note that if you're publishing generated pictures, you're probably doxing your own location, since the light pattern narrows down possible locations you could live at. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\nIf you require a short url to link to this article, please use\nhttp://ignco.de/805\n\nBut wait, there's more!\n\nWant to read more like this?
