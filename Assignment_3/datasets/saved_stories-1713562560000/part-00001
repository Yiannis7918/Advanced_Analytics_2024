He is also recognized as\nhaving made significant contributions to the concept of intentionality and\ndebates on free will.

I agree with folks like Andrew Brook and Don Ross that Dennett\n(on whom I have written) built a full philosophical system. His last interview\nmust have been a YouTube chat with Jordan Peterson, just days ago. Looking\nback now, I am even more annoyed that Peterson (on whom I have also written)\nspoke so much and listened so little...
