controversyDate| 17 November 2009  \n---|---  \nLocation| Climatic Research Unit, University of East Anglia  \nAlso known as| \"Climategate\"  \nInquiries| House of Commons Science and Technology Committee (UK)^[1]\nIndependent Climate Change Email Review (UK) International Science Assessment\nPanel (UK) Pennsylvania State University (US) United States Environmental\nProtection Agency (US) Department of Commerce (US)  \nVerdict| Exoneration or withdrawal of all major or serious charges  \n  \nThe Climatic Research Unit email controversy (also known as\n\"Climategate\")^[2]^[3] began in November 2009 with the hacking of a server at\nthe Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia (UEA) by an\nexternal attacker,^[4]^[5] copying thousands of emails and computer files (the\nClimatic Research Unit documents) to various internet locations several weeks\nbefore the Copenhagen Summit on climate change.\n\nThe story was first broken by climate change denialists,^[6]^[7] who argued\nthat the emails showed that global warming was a scientific conspiracy and\nthat scientists manipulated climate data and attempted to suppress\ncritics.^[8]^[9] The CRU rejected this, saying that the emails had been taken\nout of context.^[10]^[11] FactCheck.org reported that climate change deniers\nmisrepresented the contents of the emails.^[12] Columnist James Delingpole\npopularised the term \"Climategate\" to describe the controversy.^[13]\n\nThe mainstream media picked up the story, as negotiations over climate change\nmitigation began in Copenhagen on 7 December 2009.^[14] Because of the timing,\nscientists, policy makers and public relations experts said that the release\nof emails was a smear campaign intended to undermine the climate\nconference.^[15] In response to the controversy, the American Association for\nthe Advancement of Science (AAAS), the American Meteorological Society (AMS)\nand the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) released statements supporting the\nscientific consensus that the Earth's mean surface temperature had been rising\nfor decades, with the AAAS concluding: \"based on multiple lines of scientific\nevidence that global climate change caused by human activities is now\nunderway... it is a growing threat to society\".^[16]\n\nEight committees investigated the allegations and published reports, finding\nno evidence of fraud or scientific misconduct.^[17] The scientific consensus\nthat global warming is occurring as a result of human activity remained\nunchanged throughout the investigations.^[18]\n\n## Timeline of the initial incident[edit]\n\nThe incident began when a server used by the Climatic Research Unit was\nbreached in \"a sophisticated and carefully orchestrated attack\",^[5] and 160\nMB of data^[8] were obtained including more than 1,000 emails and 3,000 other\ndocuments.^[19] The University of East Anglia stated that the server from\nwhich the data were taken was not one that could be accessed easily, and that\nthe data could not have been released inadvertently.^[20] Norfolk Police later\nadded that the offenders used methods that are common in unlawful internet\nactivity, designed to obstruct later enquiries.^[5] The breach was first\ndiscovered on 17 November 2009 after the server of the RealClimate website was\nalso hacked and a copy of the stolen data was uploaded there.^[21]\nRealClimate's Gavin Schmidt said that he had information that the files had\nbeen obtained through \"a hack into [CRU's] backup mail server\".^[22] At about\nthe same time, a short comment appeared on climate sceptic Stephen McIntyre's\nClimate Audit website saying that \"A miracle has happened.\"^[23]\n\nOn 19 November, an archive file containing the data was copied to numerous\nlocations across the Internet.^[8] An anonymous post from a Saudi Arabian IP\naddress^[24] to the climate-sceptic blog The Air Vent^[21] described the\nmaterial as \"a random selection of correspondence, code, and documents\",\nadding that climate science is \"too important to be kept under wraps\".^[25]\nThat same day, McIntyre was forwarded an internal email sent to UEA staff\nwarning that \"climate change sceptics\u201d had obtained a \"large volume of files\nand emails\". Charles Rotter, moderator of the climate-sceptic blog Watts Up\nWith That, which had been the first to get a link and download the files, gave\na copy to his flatmate Steve Mosher. Mosher received a posting from the hacker\ncomplaining that nothing was happening and replied: \"A lot is happening behind\nthe scenes. It is not being ignored. Much is being coordinated among major\nplayers and the media. Thank you very much. You will notice the beginnings of\nactivity on other sites now. Here soon to follow.\" Shortly afterwards, the\nemails began to be widely publicised on climate-sceptics blogs.^[23] On 20\nNovember, the story emerged in mainstream media.^[8]\n\nNorfolk police subsequently confirmed that they were \"investigating criminal\noffences in relation to a data breach at the University of East Anglia\" with\nthe assistance of the Metropolitan Police Central e-Crime unit, the\nInformation Commissioner's Office (ICO), and the National Domestic Extremism\nTeam (NDET).^[26] Commenting on the involvement of the NDET, a spokesman said:\n\"At present we have two police officers assisting Norfolk with their\ninvestigation, and we have also provided computer forensic expertise. While\nthis is not strictly a domestic extremism matter, as a national police unit we\nhad the expertise and resource to assist with this investigation, as well as\ngood background knowledge of climate change issues in relation to criminal\ninvestigations.\" However, the police cautioned that \"major investigations of\nthis nature are of necessity very detailed and as a consequence can take time\nto reach a conclusion\".^[27] On 18 July 2012, the Norfolk police finally\ndecided to close its investigation because they did not have a \"realistic\nprospect of identifying the offender or offenders and launching criminal\nproceedings within the time constraints imposed by law\". They also said that\nthe attack had been carried out \"remotely via the internet\", and that there\nwas \"no evidence to suggest that anyone working at or associated with the\nUniversity of East Anglia was involved in the crime\".^[5]\n\n## Content of the documents[edit]\n\nFurther information: Climatic Research Unit documents\n\nThe material comprised more than 1,000 emails, 2,000 documents, as well as\ncommented source code pertaining to climate-change research, covering the\nperiod from 1996 to 2009.^[28] According to an analysis in The Guardian, the\nvast majority of the emails were from or to four climatologists: Phil Jones,\nthe head of the CRU; Keith Briffa, a CRU climatologist specialising in tree\nring analysis; Tim Osborn, a climate modeller at CRU; and Mike Hulme, director\nof the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research. The four were either\nrecipients or originators of all but 66 of the 1,073 emails, with most of the\nremainder of the emails being sent from mailing lists. A few other emails were\nsent by, or to, other staff at the CRU. Jones, Briffa, Osborn and Hulme had\nwritten high-profile scientific papers on climate change that had been cited\nin reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.^[22]\n\nMost of the emails concerned technical and mundane aspects of climate\nresearch, such as data analysis and details of scientific conferences.^[29]\nThe Guardian's analysis of the emails suggests that the hacker had filtered\nthem. Four scientists were targeted and a concordance plot shows that the\nwords \"data\", \"climate\", \"paper\", \"research\", \"temperature\" and \"model\" were\npredominant.^[22] The controversy has focused on a small number of emails^[29]\nwith climate change denier websites picking out particular phrases, such as\none in which Kevin Trenberth said, \"The fact is that we can\u2019t account for the\nlack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we can\u2019t\".^[21] This\nwas actually part of a discussion on the need for better monitoring of the\nenergy flows involved in short-term climate variability,^[30] but was grossly\nmischaracterised by critics.^[31]^[32]\n\nLook up trick of the trade in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.\n\nThe most quoted email was one in which Phil Jones said that he had used\n\"Mike's Nature trick\" when preparing a graph as a 1999 cover illustration for\nthe World Meteorological Organization \"to hide the decline\" in reconstructions\nbased on tree-ring proxy data post-1960, when measured temperatures were\nactually rising. The \"trick\" was a technique to combine instrumental\ntemperature record data with long term reconstructions, and \"the decline\"\nreferred to the tree-ring divergence problem,^[33] which had already been\nopenly discussed in scientific papers,^[34]^[35] but these two phrases were\ntaken out of context by commentators promoting climate change denial,\nincluding US Senator Jim Inhofe and former Governor of Alaska Sarah Palin, as\nthough the phrases referred to some decline in measured global temperatures,\neven though they came from an email written at a time when temperatures were\nat a record high.^[32]\n\nJohn Tierney, writing in The New York Times in November 2009, said that the\nclaims by sceptics of \"hoax\" or \"fraud\" were incorrect, but that the graph on\nthe cover of a report for policy makers and journalists did not show these\nnon-experts where proxy measurements changed to measured temperatures.^[36]\nThe final analyses from various subsequent inquiries concluded that in this\ncontext \"trick\" was normal scientific or mathematical jargon for a neat way of\nhandling data, in this case a statistical method used to bring two or more\ndifferent kinds of data sets together in a legitimate fashion.^[37]^[38] The\nEPA notes that in fact, the evidence shows that the research community was\nfully aware of these issues and that no one was hiding or concealing\nthem.^[39]\n\nAn Associated Press review of the emails concluded that they showed scientists\nfending off critics, stating that \"One of the most disturbing elements\nsuggests an effort to avoid sharing scientific data with critics skeptical of\nglobal warming\", and mentioned ethical problems with this action due to the\nfact that \"free access to data is important so others can repeat experiments\nas part of the scientific method\". They cited a science policy expert as\nstating that it was \"normal science politics, but on the extreme end, though\nstill within bounds\".^[40]\n\n## Responses[edit]\n\nIn the United States, former Republican House Science Committee chairman\nSherwood Boehlert called the attacks a \"manufactured distraction\", and\nNewsweek and The New York Times described the dispute as a \"highly\norchestrated\" and manufactured controversy. Concerns about the media's role in\npromoting early allegations while also minimising later coverage exonerating\nthe scientists were raised by journalists and policy experts. Historian\nSpencer R. Weart of the American Institute of Physics said the incident was\nunprecedented in the history of science, having \"never before seen a set of\npeople accuse an entire community of scientists of deliberate deception and\nother professional malfeasance\".^[41] The United States National Academy of\nSciences expressed concern and condemned what they called \"political assaults\non scientists and climate scientists in particular\".^[42]\n\nIn the United Kingdom and United States, there were calls for official\ninquiries into issues raised by the documents. The British Conservative\npolitician Lord Lawson said: \"The integrity of the scientific evidence ... has\nbeen called into question. And the reputation of British science has been\nseriously tarnished. A high-level independent inquiry must be set up without\ndelay.\" Bob Ward of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the\nEnvironment at the London School of Economics said that there had to be a\nrigorous investigation into the substance of the email messages, once\nappropriate action has been taken over the hacking, to clear the impression of\nimpropriety given by the selective disclosure and dissemination of the\nmessages.^[43] United States Senator Jim Inhofe, who had previously stated\nthat global warming was \"the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American\npeople\",^[44] also planned to demand an inquiry.^[45] In a debate in the\nUnited States House of Representatives on 2 December 2009, Republicans read\nout extracts from eight of the emails, and Representative Jim Sensenbrenner\nsaid: \"These e-mails show a pattern of suppression, manipulation and secrecy\nthat was inspired by ideology, condescension and profit\". In response, the\npresident's science adviser John Holdren said that the science was proper, and\nthe emails only concerned a fraction of the research. Government scientist\nJane Lubchenco said that the emails \"do nothing to undermine the very strong\nscientific consensus\" that the Earth is warming, largely due to human\nactions.^[46]\n\nClimate change sceptics gained wide publicity in blogs and news media,^[32]\nmaking allegations that the hacked emails showed evidence that climate\nscientists manipulated data.^[8] A few other commentators such as Roger A.\nPielke^[47] said that the evidence supported claims that dissenting scientific\npapers had been suppressed.^[48] The Wall Street Journal reported that the\nemails revealed apparent efforts to ensure that the IPCC included their own\nviews and excluded others, and that the scientists withheld scientific\ndata.^[49]\n\nAn editorial in Nature stated that \"A fair reading of the e-mails reveals\nnothing to support the denialists' conspiracy theories.\" It said that emails\nshowed harassment of researchers, with multiple Freedom of Information\nrequests to the Climatic Research Unit, but release of information had been\nhampered by national government restrictions on releasing the meteorological\ndata researchers had been using. Nature considered that emails had not shown\nanything that undermined the scientific case on human-caused global warming or\nraised any substantive reasons for concern about the researchers' own\npapers.^[50] The Telegraph reported that academics and climate change\nresearchers dismissed the allegations, saying that nothing in the emails\nproved wrongdoing.^[51] Independent reviews by FactCheck and the Associated\nPress said that the emails did not affect evidence that man-made global\nwarming is a real threat, and said that emails were being misrepresented to\nsupport unfounded claims of scientific misconduct. The AP said that the\n\"[e]-mails stolen from climate scientists show they stonewalled sceptics and\ndiscussed hiding data\".^[52]^[40] In this context, John Tierney of The New\nYork Times wrote: \"these researchers, some of the most prominent climate\nexperts in Britain and America, seem so focused on winning the public-\nrelations war that they exaggerate their certitude \u2013 and ultimately undermine\ntheir own cause\".^[36]\n\nClimate scientists at the CRU and elsewhere received numerous threatening and\nabusive emails in the wake of the initial incidents.^[53]^[54] Norfolk Police\ninterviewed Phil Jones about death threats made against him following the\nrelease of the emails; Jones later said that the police told him that these\n\"didn't fulfil the criteria for death threats\".^[55] Death threats against two\nscientists also are under investigation by the US Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation.^[53]^[needs update] Climate scientists in Australia have\nreported receiving threatening emails including references to where they live\nand warnings to \"be careful\" about how some people might react to their\nscientific findings.^[56] In July 2012, Michael Mann said that the episode had\ncaused him to \"endure countless verbal attacks upon my professional\nreputation, my honesty, my integrity, even my life and liberty\".^[57]\n\n### University of East Anglia[edit]\n\nThe University of East Anglia was notified of the security breach on 17\nNovember 2009, but when the story was published in the press on 20 November,\nthey had no statement ready.^[58] On 24 November, Trevor Davies, the\nUniversity of East Anglia pro-vice-chancellor with responsibility for\nresearch, rejected calls for Jones' resignation or firing: \"We see no reason\nfor Professor Jones to resign and, indeed, we would not accept his\nresignation. He is a valued and important scientist.\" The university announced\nthat it would conduct an independent review into issues including Freedom of\nInformation requests to the Climatic Research Unit: it would \"address the\nissue of data security, an assessment of how we responded to a deluge of\nFreedom of Information requests, and any other relevant issues which the\nindependent reviewer advises should be addressed\".^[59]\n\nThe university announced on 1 December that Phil Jones was to stand aside as\ndirector of the Unit until the completion of the review.^[60]^[61] Two days\nlater, the university announced that Sir Muir Russell would chair the inquiry,\nwhich would be known as the Independent Climate Change Email Review, and would\n\"examine email exchanges to determine whether there is evidence of suppression\nor manipulation of data\". The review would also scrutinise the CRU's policies\nand practices for \"acquiring, assembling, subjecting to peer review, and\ndisseminating data and research findings\" and \"their compliance or otherwise\nwith best scientific practice\". In addition, the investigation would review\nCRU's compliance with Freedom of Information Act requests and also \"make\nrecommendations about the management, governance and security structures for\nCRU and the security, integrity and release of the data it holds\".^[62] The\nIndependent Climate Change Email Review report was published on 7 July\n2010.^[63]\n\nOn 22 March 2010 the university announced the composition of an independent\nScience Assessment Panel to reassess key CRU papers that have already been\npeer-reviewed and published in journals. The panel did not seek to evaluate\nthe science itself, but rather whether \"the conclusions [reached by the CRU]\nrepresented an honest and scientifically justified interpretation of the\ndata\". The university consulted with the Royal Society in establishing the\npanel. It was chaired by Lord Oxburgh, and its membership consisted of Huw\nDavies of ETH Zurich, Kerry Emanual of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,\nLisa Graumlich of the University of Arizona, David Hand of Imperial College\nLondon, and Herbert Huppert and Michael Kelly of the University of Cambridge.\nIt started its work in March 2010 and released its report on 14 April\n2010.^[64] During its inquiry, the panel examined eleven representative CRU\npublications, selected with advice from the Royal Society, that spanned a\nperiod of over 20 years, as well as other CRU research materials. It also\nspent fifteen person-days at the UEA carrying out interviews with\nscientists.^[64]\n\n### Climatologists[edit]\n\nAmong the scientists whose emails were disclosed, the CRU's researchers said\nin a statement that the emails had been taken out of context and merely\nreflected an honest exchange of ideas. Michael Mann, director of Pennsylvania\nState University's Earth System Science Center, said that sceptics were\n\"taking these words totally out of context to make something trivial appear\nnefarious\"^[19] and called the entire incident a careful, \"high-level,\norchestrated smear campaign to distract the public about the nature of the\nclimate change problem\".^[65] Kevin E. Trenberth of the National Center for\nAtmospheric Research said that he was appalled at the release of the emails\nbut thought that it might backfire against climate sceptics, as the messages\nwould show \"the integrity of scientists\".^[21] He also said that climate\nchange sceptics had selectively quoted words and phrases out of context and\nthat the timing suggested an attempt to undermine talks at the December 2009\nCopenhagen global climate summit.^[66] Tom Wigley, a former director of the\nCRU and now head of the US National Center for Atmospheric Research, condemned\nthe threats that he and other colleagues had received as \"truly stomach-\nturning\", and commented: \"None of it affects the science one iota. Accusations\nof data distortion or faking are baseless. I can rebut and explain all of the\napparently incriminating e-mails that I have looked at, but it is going to be\nvery time consuming to do so.\"^[53] In relation to the harassment that he and\nhis colleagues were experiencing, he said: \"This sort of thing has been going\non at a much lower level for almost 20 years and there have been other\noutbursts of this sort of behaviour \u2013 criticism and abusive emails and things\nlike that in the past. So this is a worse manifestation but it's happened\nbefore so it's not that surprising.\"^[67]\n\nOther prominent climate scientists, such as Richard Somerville, called the\nincident a smear campaign.^[68] David Reay of the University of Edinburgh said\nthat the CRU \"is just one of many climate-research institutes that provide the\nunderlying scientific basis for climate policy at national and international\nlevels. The conspiracy theorists may be having a field day, but if they really\nknew academia they would also know that every published paper and data set is\ncontinually put through the wringer by other independent research groups. The\ninformation that makes it into the IPCC reports is some of the most rigorously\ntested and debated in any area of science.\"^[53] Stephen Schneider compared\nthe political attacks on climate scientists to the witch-hunts of\nMcCarthyism.^[69]\n\nJames Hansen said that the controversy has \"no effect on the science\" and that\nwhile some of the emails reflect poor judgment, the evidence for human-made\nclimate change is overwhelming.^[70]\n\nOne of the IPCC's lead authors, Raymond Pierrehumbert of the University of\nChicago, expressed concern at the precedent established by this incident:\n\"[T]his is a criminal act of vandalism and of harassment of a group of\nscientists that are only going about their business doing science. It\nrepresents a whole new escalation in the war on climate scientists who are\nonly trying to get at the truth... What next? Deliberate monkeying with data\non servers? Insertion of bugs into climate models?\"^[71] Another IPCC lead\nauthor, David Karoly of the University of Melbourne, reported receiving hate\nemails in the wake of the incident and said that he believed that there was\n\"an organised campaign to discredit individual climate scientists\". Andrew\nPitman of the University of New South Wales commented: \"The major problem is\nthat scientists have to be able to communicate their science without fear or\nfavour and there seems to be a well-orchestrated campaign designed to\nintimidate some scientists.\"^[56]\n\nIn response to the incident, 1,700 British scientists signed a joint statement\ncirculated by the UK Met Office declaring their \"utmost confidence in the\nobservational evidence for global warming and the scientific basis for\nconcluding that it is due primarily to human activities\".^[72]\n\nPatrick J. Michaels, who was criticised in the emails and who has long faulted\nevidence pointing to human-driven warming, said: \"This is not a smoking gun;\nthis is a mushroom cloud\". He said that some emails showed an effort to block\nthe release of data for independent review and that some messages discussed\ndiscrediting him by stating that he knew his research was wrong in his\ndoctoral dissertation, \"This shows these are people willing to bend rules and\ngo after other people's reputations in very serious ways.\"^[21]\n\nJudith Curry wrote that, in her opinion, \"there are two broader issues raised\nby these emails that are impeding the public credibility of climate research:\nlack of transparency in climate data, and 'tribalism' in some segments of the\nclimate research community that is impeding peer review and the assessment\nprocess\". She hoped that the affair would change the approach of scientists to\nproviding their data to the public and their response to criticisms of their\nwork. She had herself learned to be careful about what to put in emails when a\n\"disgruntled employee\" made a freedom of information request. Mann described\nthese comments as \"somewhat naive\" considering that in recent years scientists\nhad become much more open with their data. He said that sceptics \"will always\ncomplain about something else, want something more. Eventually, as we see,\nthey've found a way to get access to private communications between\nscientists.\"^[65]\n\nHans von Storch, who also concurs with the mainstream view on global\nwarming,^[73] said that the University of East Anglia (UEA) had \"violated a\nfundamental principle of science\" by refusing to share data with other\nresearchers. \"They play science as a power game,\" he said.^[74] On 24 November\n2009 the university had stated that 95% of the raw station data was accessible\nvia the Global Historical Climatology Network, and had been for several years.\nThey were already working with the Met Office to obtain permissions to release\nthe remaining raw data.^[75]\n\n### Scientific organisations[edit]\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Working Group I issued\nstatements that the assessment process, involving hundreds of scientists\nworldwide, is designed to be transparent and to prevent any individual or\nsmall group from manipulating the process. The statement said that the\n\"internal consistency from multiple lines of evidence strongly supports the\nwork of the scientific community, including those individuals singled out in\nthese email exchanges\".^[76]^[77]\n\nThe American Meteorological Society stated that the incident did not affect\nthe society's position on climate change. They pointed to the breadth of\nevidence for human influence on climate, stating:^[78]\n\n> For climate change research, the body of research in the literature is very\n> large and the dependence on any one set of research results to the\n> comprehensive understanding of the climate system is very, very small. Even\n> if some of the charges of improper behavior in this particular case turn out\n> to be true\u2014which is not yet clearly the case\u2014the impact on the science of\n> climate change would be very limited.\n\nThe American Geophysical Union issued a statement that they found \"it\noffensive that these emails were obtained by illegal cyber attacks and they\nare being exploited to distort the scientific debate about the urgent issue of\nclimate change\". They reaffirmed their 2007 position statement on climate\nchange \"based on the large body of scientific evidence that Earth's climate is\nwarming and that human activity is a contributing factor. Nothing in the\nUniversity of East Anglia hacked e-mails represents a significant challenge to\nthat body of scientific evidence.\"^[79]\n\nThe American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) reaffirmed its\nposition on global warming and \"expressed grave concerns that the illegal\nrelease of private emails stolen from the University of East Anglia should not\ncause policy-makers and the public to become confused about the scientific\nbasis of global climate change. Scientific integrity demands robust,\nindependent peer review, however, and AAAS therefore emphasised that\ninvestigations are appropriate whenever significant questions are raised\nregarding the transparency and rigour of the scientific method, the peer-\nreview process, or the responsibility of individual scientists. The\nresponsible institutions are mounting such investigations.\" Alan I. Leshner,\nCEO of the AAAS and executive publisher of the journal Science, said: \"AAAS\ntakes issues of scientific integrity very seriously. It is fair and\nappropriate to pursue answers to any allegations of impropriety. It\u2019s\nimportant to remember, though, that the reality of climate change is based on\na century of robust and well-validated science.\"^[80]\n\n### UK Met Office[edit]\n\nOn 23 November 2009, a spokesman for the Met Office, the UK's national weather\nservice, which works with the CRU in providing global temperature information,\nsaid that there was no need for an inquiry. \"The bottom line is that\ntemperatures continue to rise and humans are responsible for it. We have every\nconfidence in the science and the various datasets we use. The peer-review\nprocess is as robust as it could possibly be.\"^[43]\n\nOn 5 December 2009, however, the Met Office indicated its intention to re-\nexamine 160 years of temperature data in the light of concerns that public\nconfidence in the science had been damaged by the controversy over the\nemails.^[81] The Met Office would also publish online the temperature records\nfor over 1,000 worldwide weather stations.^[82]^[83] It remained confident\nthat its analysis would be shown to be correct^[81] and that the data would\nshow a temperature rise over the past 150 years.^[82]^[84]\n\n### Other responses[edit]\n\nRajendra Pachauri, as chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate\nChange, told the BBC in December 2009 that he considered the affair to be \"a\nserious issue\" and that they \"will look into it in detail\".^[85] He later\nclarified that the IPCC would review the incident to identify lessons to be\nlearned and rejected suggestions that the IPCC itself should carry out an\ninvestigation.\n\nIn a series of emails sent through a National Academy of Sciences (NAS)\nlistserv, apparently forwarded outside the group by an unknown person,\nscientists discussing the \"Climategate\" fallout considered launching\nadvertising campaigns, widening their public presence, pushing the NAS to take\na more active role in explaining climate science and creating a nonprofit to\nserve as a voice for the scientific community.^[86]\n\nA paper by Reiner Grundmann used a limited account of the events to discuss\nnorms of scientific practice in relation to two science ethics approaches, the\nMertonian norms as of Robert K. Merton, and Roger Pielke Jr.'s concept of\nhonest brokering in science policy interactions. Sources for the paper were\nchosen for accessibility, emphasising \"critical accounts\".^[87]\n\n## Inquiries and reports[edit]\n\nEight committees investigated the allegations and published reports, finding\nno evidence of fraud or scientific misconduct.^[17] The scientific consensus\nthat global warming is occurring as a result of human activity remained\nunchanged by the end of the investigations.^[18] However, the reports urged\nthe scientists to avoid any such allegations in the future, and to regain\npublic confidence following this media storm, with \"more efforts than ever to\nmake available all their supporting data \u2013 right down to the computer codes\nthey use \u2013 to allow their findings to be properly verified\". Climate\nscientists and organisations pledged to improve scientific research and\ncollaboration with other researchers by improving data management and opening\nup access to data, and to honour any freedom of information requests that\nrelate to climate science.^[88]\n\n### House of Commons Science and Technology Committee[edit]\n\nOn 22 January 2010, the House of Commons Science and Technology Select\nCommittee announced it would conduct an inquiry into the affair, examining the\nimplications of the disclosure for the integrity of scientific research,\nreviewing the scope of the independent Muir Russell review announced by the\nUEA, and reviewing the independence of international climate data sets.^[89]\nThe committee invited written submissions from interested parties, and\npublished 55 submissions that it had received by 10 February. They included\nsubmissions from the University of East Anglia, the Global Warming Policy\nFoundation, the Institute of Physics, the Royal Society of Chemistry, the Met\nOffice, several other professional bodies, prominent scientists, some climate\nchange sceptics, several MEPs and other interested parties.^[90] An oral\nevidence session was held on 1 March 2010.^[91]\n\nThe Science and Technology Select Committee inquiry reported on 31 March 2010\nthat it had found that \"the scientific reputation of Professor Jones and CRU\nremains intact\". The emails and claims raised in the controversy did not\nchallenge the scientific consensus that \"global warming is happening and that\nit is induced by human activity\". The MPs had seen no evidence to support\nclaims that Jones had tampered with data or interfered with the peer-review\nprocess.^[92]\n\nThe committee criticised a \"culture of non-disclosure at CRU\" and a general\nlack of transparency in climate science where scientific papers had usually\nnot included all the data and code used in reconstructions. It said that \"even\nif the data that CRU used were not publicly available\u2014which they mostly are\u2014or\nthe methods not published\u2014which they have been\u2014its published results would\nstill be credible: the results from CRU agree with those drawn from other\ninternational data sets; in other words, the analyses have been repeated and\nthe conclusions have been verified.\" The report added that \"scientists could\nhave saved themselves a lot of trouble by aggressively publishing all their\ndata instead of worrying about how to stonewall their critics.\" The committee\ncriticised the university for the way that freedom of information requests\nwere handled, and for failing to give adequate support to the scientists to\ndeal with such requests.^[93]\n\nThe committee chairman Phil Willis said that the \"standard practice\" in\nclimate science generally of not routinely releasing all raw data and computer\ncodes \"needs to change and it needs to change quickly\". Jones had admitted\nsending \"awful emails\"; Willis commented that \"[Jones] probably wishes that\nemails were never invented,\" but \"apart from that we do believe that Prof.\nJones has in many ways been scapegoated as a result of what really was a\nfrustration on his part that people were asking for information purely to\nundermine his research.\"^[37] In Willis' view this did not excuse any failure\nto deal properly with FOI Act requests, but the committee accepted that Jones\nhad released all the data that he could.^[37] It stated: \"There is no reason\nwhy Professor Jones should not resume his post. He was certainly not co-\noperative with those seeking to get data, but that was true of all the climate\nscientists\".^[94]\n\nThe committee was careful to point out that its report had been written after\na single day of oral testimony and would not be as in-depth as other\ninquiries.^[92]\n\n### Science Assessment Panel[edit]\n\nThe report of the independent Science Assessment Panel was published on 14\nApril 2010 and concluded that the panel had seen \"no evidence of any\ndeliberate scientific malpractice in any of the work of the Climatic Research\nUnit.\" It found that the CRU's work had been \"carried out with integrity\" and\nhad used \"fair and satisfactory\" methods. The CRU was found to be \"objective\nand dispassionate in their view of the data and their results, and there was\nno hint of tailoring results to a particular agenda.\" Instead, \"their sole aim\nwas to establish as robust a record of temperatures in recent centuries as\npossible.\"^[64]\n\nThe panel commented that it was \"very surprising that research in an area that\ndepends so heavily on statistical methods has not been carried out in close\ncollaboration with professional statisticians.\" It found that although the CRU\nhad not made inappropriate use of statistical methods, some of the methods\nused may not have been the best for the purpose, though it said that \"it is\nnot clear, however, that better methods would have produced significantly\ndifferent results.\" It suggested that the CRU could have done more to document\nand archive its work, data and algorithms and stated that the scientists were\n\"ill prepared\" for the amount of public attention generated by their work,\ncommenting that \"as with many small research groups their internal procedures\nwere rather informal.\" The media and other scientific organisations were\ncriticised for having \"sometimes neglected\" to reflect the uncertainties,\ndoubts and assumptions of the work done by the CRU. The UK Government's policy\nof charging for access to scientific data was described as \"inconsistent with\npolicies of open access to data promoted elsewhere.\" The panel was also stated\nthat \"Although we deplore the tone of much of the criticism that has been\ndirected at CRU, we believe that this questioning of the methods and data used\nin dendroclimatology will ultimately have a beneficial effect and improve\nworking practices.\" It found that some of the criticism had been \"selective\nand uncharitable\" and critics had displayed \"a lack of awareness\" of the\ndifficulties of research in this area.^[64]\n\nSpeaking at a press conference to announce the report, the panel's chair, Lord\nOxburgh, stated that his team had found \"absolutely no evidence of any\nimpropriety whatsoever\" and that \"whatever was said in the emails, the basic\nscience seems to have been done fairly and properly.\" He said that many of the\ncriticisms and allegations of scientific misconduct had been made by people\n\"who do not like the implications of some of the conclusions\" reached by the\nCRU's scientists. He said that the repeated FOI requests made by climate\nchange sceptic Steve McIntyre and others could have amounted to a campaign of\nharassment, and the issue of how FOI laws should be applied in an academic\ncontext remained unresolved.^[95] Another panel member, Professor David Hand,\ncommended the CRU for being explicit about the inherent uncertainties in its\nresearch data, commenting that \"there is no evidence of anything underhand \u2013\nthe opposite, if anything, they have brought out into the open the\nuncertainties with what they are dealing with.\"^[96]\n\nAt the press conference, Hand also commented on the well publicised 1998 paper\nproduced in the United States by scientists led by Michael E. Mann, saying\nthat the hockey stick graph it showed was a genuine effect, but he had an\n\"uneasy feeling\" about the use of \"inappropriate statistical tools\" and said\nthat the 1998 study had exaggerated the effect. He commended McIntyre for\npointing out this issue. Mann subsequently told The Guardian that the study\nhad been examined and approved in the US National Academies of Science North\nReport, and described Hand's comment as a \"rogue opinion\" not meriting \"much\nattention or credence\".^[95]\n\nThe UEA's vice-chancellor, Edward Acton, welcomed the panel's findings.\nDescribing its report as \"hugely positive\", he stated that \"it is especially\nimportant that, despite a deluge of allegations and smears against the CRU,\nthis independent group of utterly reputable scientists have concluded that\nthere was no evidence of any scientific malpractice.\"^[97] He criticised the\nway that the emails had been misrepresented, saying that \"UEA has already put\non record its deep regret and anger that the theft of emails from the\nUniversity, and the blatant misrepresentation of their contents as revealed\nboth in this report and the previous one by the Science and Technology Select\nCommittee, damaged the reputation of UK climate science.\"^[98] The UEA issued\na statement in which it accepted that \"things might have been done better.\" It\nsaid that improvements had already been undertaken by the CRU and others in\nthe climate science community and that the University would \"continue to\nensure that these imperatives are maintained.\"^[99]\n\nIt later emerged that the Science Assessment Panel was not assessing the\nquality but instead the integrity of the CRU's science. Phil Willis described\nthis a \"sleight of hand\" and was not what the Parliamentary Committee he had\nchaired had been led to believe. There were also questions about the selection\nof publications examined by the panel.^[100] Lord Oxburgh said that Acton had\nbeen wrong to tell the Science and Technology Select Committee in March that\nhis inquiry would look into the science itself. \"I think that was inaccurate,\"\nOxburgh said. \"This had to be done rapidly. This was their concern. They\nreally wanted something within a month. There was no way our panel could\nevaluate the science.\"^[101]\n\n### Pennsylvania State University[edit]\n\nPennsylvania State University announced in December 2009 it would review the\nwork of Michael E. Mann, in particular looking at anything that had not\nalready been addressed in the 2006 North Report review by the National\nResearch Council of the National Academy of Sciences which had investigated\nMann's \"hockey stick graph\" studies and found some faults with his 1998\nmethodology but agreed with the results which had been reaffirmed by later\nstudies using different methods.^[102]^[103]^[104] In response, Mann said he\nwould welcome the review.^[104] The inquiry committee determined on 3 February\n2010 that there was no credible evidence Mann suppressed or falsified data,\ndestroyed emails, information and/or data related to the IPCC Fourth\nAssessment Report, or misused privileged or confidential information. The\ncommittee did not make a definitive finding on the final point of inquiry \u2013\n\"whether Dr Mann seriously deviated from accepted practices within the\nacademic community for proposing, conducting, or reporting research or other\nscholarly activities\". The committee said that the earlier NAS inquiry had\nfound \"that Dr Mann\u2019s science did fall well within the bounds of accepted\npractice\", but in light of the newly available information this question of\nconduct was to be investigated by a second panel of five prominent Penn State\nscientists from other scientific disciplines.^[38]^[105]\n\nThe second Investigatory Committee reported on 4 June 2010 that it had\n\"determined that Dr Michael E. Mann did not engage in, nor did he participate\nin, directly or indirectly, any actions that seriously deviated from accepted\npractices within the academic community.\" Regarding his sharing unpublished\nmanuscripts with colleagues on the assumption of implied consent, it\nconsidered such sharing to be \"careless and inappropriate\" without following\nthe best practice of getting express consent from the authors in advance,\nthough expert opinion on this varied. It said that his success in proposing\nresearch and obtaining funding for it, commenting that this \"clearly places Dr\nMann among the most respected scientists in his field. Such success would not\nhave been possible had he not met or exceeded the highest standards of his\nprofession for proposing research.\" Mann's extensive recognitions within the\nresearch community demonstrated that \"his scientific work, especially the\nconduct of his research, has from the beginning of his career been judged to\nbe outstanding by a broad spectrum of scientists.\" It agreed unanimously that\n\"there is no substance\" to the allegations against Mann.^[106]^[107]\n\nMann said he regretted not objecting to a suggestion from Jones in a 29 May\n2008 message that he destroy emails. \"I wish in retrospect I had told him,\n'Hey, you shouldn't even be thinking about this,'\" Mann said in March 2010. \"I\ndidn't think it was an appropriate request.\" Mann's response to Jones at the\ntime was that he would pass on the request to another scientist. \"The\nimportant thing is, I didn't delete any emails. And I don't think [Jones] did\neither.\"^[108]\n\n### Independent Climate Change Email Review[edit]\n\nFirst announced in December 2009, a British investigation commissioned by the\nUEA and chaired by Sir Muir Russell, published its final report in July\n2010.^[109] The commission cleared the scientists and dismissed allegations\nthat they manipulated their data. The \"rigour and honesty\" of the scientists\nat the Climatic Research Unit were found not to be in doubt.^[110] The panel\nfound that they did not subvert the peer review process to censor criticism as\nalleged, and that the key data needed to reproduce their findings was freely\navailable to any \"competent\" researcher.^[111]\n\nThe panel did rebuke the CRU for their reluctance to release computer files,\nand found that a graph produced in 1999 was \"misleading,\" though not\ndeliberately so as necessary caveats had been included in the accompanying\ntext.^[112] It found evidence that emails might have been deleted in order to\nmake them unavailable should a subsequent request be made for them, though the\npanel did not ask anyone at CRU whether they had actually done this.^[113]\n\nAt the conclusion of the inquiry, Jones was reinstated with the newly created\npost of Director of Research.^[110]^[111]^[114]\n\n### United States Environmental Protection Agency report[edit]\n\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had issued an\n\"endangerment finding\" in 2009 in preparation for climate regulations on\nexcessive greenhouse gases. Petitions to reconsider this were raised by the\nstates of Virginia and Texas, conservative activists and business groups\nincluding the United States Chamber of Commerce, the Competitive Enterprise\nInstitute and the coal company Peabody Energy, making claims that the CRU\nemails undermined the science.^[115]\n\nThe EPA examined every email and concluded that there was no merit to the\nclaims in the petitions, which \"routinely misunderstood the scientific\nissues\", reached \"faulty scientific conclusions\", \"resorted to hyperbole\", and\n\"often cherry-pick language that creates the suggestion or appearance of\nimpropriety, without looking deeper into the issues.\"^[116] In a statement\nissued on 29 July 2010, EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson said the petitions\nwere based \"on selectively edited, out-of-context data and a manufactured\ncontroversy\" and provided \"no evidence to undermine our determination. Excess\ngreenhouse gases are a threat to our health and welfare.\"^[117]\n\nThe EPA issued a detailed report on issues raised by petitioners and\nresponses, together with a fact sheet,^[118] and a \"myths versus facts\" page\nstating that \"Petitioners say that emails disclosed from CRU provide evidence\nof a conspiracy to manipulate data. The media coverage after the emails were\nreleased was based on email statements quoted out of context and on\nunsubstantiated theories of conspiracy. The CRU emails do not show either that\nthe science is flawed or that the scientific process has been compromised. EPA\ncarefully reviewed the CRU emails and found no indication of improper data\nmanipulation or misrepresentation of results.\"^[119]\n\n### Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Commerce[edit]\n\nIn May 2010 Senator Jim Inhofe requested the Inspector General of the United\nStates Department of Commerce to conduct an independent review of how the\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) had dealt with the\nemails, and whether the emails showed any wrongdoing.^[120] The report, issued\non 18 February 2011,^[121] cleared the researchers and \"did not find any\nevidence that NOAA inappropriately manipulated data or failed to adhere to\nappropriate peer review procedures\". It noted that NOAA reviewed its climate\nchange data as standard procedure, not in response to the controversy. One\nemail included a cartoon image showing Inhofe and others marooned on a melting\nice floe, NOAA had taken this up as a conduct issue. In response to questions\nraised, NOAA stated that its scientists had followed legal advice on FOIA\nrequests for information which belonged to the IPCC and was made available by\nthat panel. In two instances funding had been awarded to CRU,^[120] NOAA\nstated that it was reviewing these cases and so far understood that the funds\nsupported climate forecasting workshops in 2002 and 2003 assisting the\ngovernments of three countries.^[122]\n\n### National Science Foundation[edit]\n\nThe Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of the National Science Foundation\nclosed an investigation on 15 August 2011 that exonerated Michael Mann of\nPennsylvania State University of charges of scientific misconduct.^[123] It\nfound no evidence of research misconduct, and confirmed the results of earlier\ninquiries.^[124] The OIG reviewed the findings of the July 2010 Penn State\npanel, took further evidence from the university and Mann, and interviewed\nMann. The OIP findings confirmed the university panel's conclusions which\ncleared Mann of any wrongdoing, and it stated \"Lacking any evidence of\nresearch misconduct, as defined under the NSF Research Misconduct Regulation,\nwe are closing the investigation with no further action.\"^[125]\n\n## ICO decisions on Freedom of Information requests[edit]\n\nMain article: Freedom of Information requests to the Climatic Research Unit\n\nIn two cases, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) issued decisions on\nappeals of Freedom of Information (FOI) requests which had been turned down by\nthe university.\n\nDavid Holland, an electrical engineer from Northampton, made a 2008 FOI\nrequest for all emails to and from Keith Briffa about the IPCC Fourth\nAssessment Report; the university's information policy and compliance manager\nrefused the request. On 23 November 2009, after the start of the controversy,\nhe wrote to the Commissioner explaining in detail the relevance of the alleged\nCRU emails to his case,^[126] with specific reference to a May 2008 email in\nwhich Phil Jones asked others to delete emails discussing AR4 with\nBriffa.^[127] In January 2010 news reports highlighted that FOI legislation\nmade it an offence to intentionally act to prevent the disclosure of requested\ninformation, but the statute of limitations meant that any prosecution had to\nbe raised within 6 months of the alleged offence. This was discussed by the\nHouse of Commons Science and Technology Select Committee.^[128] The ICO\ndecision on Holland's requests published on 7 July 2010 concluded that the\nemails indicated prima facie evidence of an offence, but as prosecution was\ntime-barred the Commissioner had been unable to investigate the alleged\noffence. On the issue of the university failing to provide responses within\nthe correct time, no further action was needed as Holland was content not to\nproceed with his complaint.^[127]\n\nThe Climatic Research Unit developed its gridded CRUTEM data set of land air\ntemperature anomalies from instrumental temperature records held by National\nMeteorological Organisations around the world, often under formal or informal\nconfidentiality agreements that restricted use of this raw data to academic\npurposes, and prevented it from being passed onto third parties. Over 95% of\nthe CRU climate data set had been available to the public for several years\nbefore July 2009,^[75] when the university received numerous FOI requests for\nraw data or details of the confidentiality agreements from Stephen McIntyre\nand readers of his Climate Audit blog. Phil Jones of CRU announced that\nrequests were being made to all the National Meteorological Organisations for\ntheir agreement to waive confidentiality,^[129] with the aim of publishing all\nthe data jointly with the Met Office.^[130] McIntyre complained that data\ndenied to him had been sent to Jones's colleague Peter Webster at the Georgia\nInstitute of Technology for work on a joint publication, and FOI requests for\nthis data were made by Jonathan A. Jones of the University of Oxford and Don\nKeiller of Anglia Ruskin University.^[131] Both requests were refused by the\nUEA by 11 September 2009.^[132] Though some National Meteorological\nOrganisations gave full or conditional agreement to waive confidentiality,\nothers failed to respond, and the request was explicitly refused by Trinidad\nand Tobago and Poland. In discussions with the ICO, the university argued that\nthe data was publicly available from the Met organisations, and the lack of\nagreement exempted the remaining data. In its decision released on 23 June\n2011, the ICO stated that the data was not easily available, and required the\nuniversity to release the data covered by the FOIA request.^[132] On 27 July\n2011 CRU announced that the raw instrumental data not already in the public\ndomain had been released and was available for download, with the exception of\nPoland which was outside the area covered by the FOIA request. The university\nremained concerned \"that the forced release of material from a source which\nhas explicitly refused to give permission for release could have some damaging\nconsequences for the UK in international research collaborations.\"^[131]^[133]\n\nIn September 2011 the ICO issued new guidance to universities, taking into\naccount issues raised in relation to the CRU information requests. This\ndescribes exceptions and exemptions to protect research, including allowance\nfor internal exchange of views between academics and researchers, leaving\nformulation of opinions on research free from external scrutiny. It notes the\nbenefits of actively disclosing information when it is in the public interest,\nand disclosure of personal email information related to public authority\nbusiness.^[134]\n\n## Media coverage[edit]\n\nSee also: Media coverage of climate change\n\nThe initial story about the hacking originated in the blogosphere,^[6] with\ncolumnist James Delingpole picking up the term \"Climategate\" from an anonymous\nblogger on Watts Up With That?, a blog created by climate sceptic Anthony\nWatts. The site was one of three blogs that received links to the leaked\ndocuments on 17 November 2009. Delingpole first used the word \"Climategate\" in\nthe title of his 20 November article for The Telegraph: \"Climategate: the\nfinal nail in the coffin of 'Anthropogenic Global Warming'?\" A week later, his\nco-worker Christopher Booker gave Delingpole credit for coining the term.^[13]\nFollowing the release of documents in the blogosphere, unproven allegations\nand personal attacks against scientists increased and made their way into the\ntraditional media. Physicist Mark Boslough of the University of New Mexico\nnoted that many of the attacks on scientists came from \"bloggers, editorial\nwriters, Fox News pundits, and radio talk show hosts who have called them\nliars and vilified them as frauds\". According to Chris Mooney and Sheril\nKirshenbaum in their book Unscientific America (2010), the accusations\noriginated in right-wing media and blogs, \"especially on outlets like Fox\nNews\". Journalist Suzanne Goldenberg of The Guardian reported that according\nto an analysis by Media Matters, \"Fox had tried to delegitimise the work of\nclimate scientists in its coverage of the hacked emails from the University of\nEast Anglia\" and had \"displayed a pattern of trying to skew coverage in favour\nof the fringe minority which doubts the existence of climate change\".^[14]\n\nThe intense media coverage of the documents stolen from climate researchers at\nthe University of East Anglia created public confusion about the scientific\nconsensus on climate change, leading several publications to comment on the\npropagation of the controversy in the media in the wake of a series of\ninvestigations that cleared the scientists of any wrongdoing. In an editorial,\nThe New York Times described the coverage as a \"manufactured controversy\" and\nexpressed hope that the investigations clearing the scientists \"will receive\nas much circulation as the original, diversionary controversies\".^[135]\nWriting for Newsweek, journalist Sharon Begley called the controversy a\n\"highly orchestrated, manufactured scandal\", noting that the public was\nunlikely to change their mind. Regardless of the reports exonerating the\nscientists, Begley noted that \"one of the strongest, most-repeated findings in\nthe psychology of belief is that once people have been told X, especially if X\nis shocking, if they are later told, 'No, we were wrong about X,' most people\nstill believe X.\"^[136]\n\nJean-Pascal van Ypersele, vice-chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate\nChange (IPCC) and science historian Naomi Oreskes said that the \"attacks on\nclimate science that were made ahead of the Copenhagen climate change summit\nwere 'organised' to undermine efforts to tackle global warming and mirror the\nearlier tactics of the tobacco industry\".^[137] Noting the media circus that\noccurred when the story first broke, Oreskes and Erik Conway writing about\nclimate change denial, said that following the investigations \"the vindication\nof the climate scientists has received very little coverage at all.\nVindication is not as sexy as accusation, and many people are still\nsuspicious. After all, some of those emails, taken out of context, sounded\ndamning. But what they show is that climate scientists are frustrated, because\nfor two decades they have been under attack.\"^[138]\n\nBill Royce, head of the European practice on energy, environment and climate\nchange at the United States communications firm Burson-Marsteller, also\ndescribed the incident as an organised effort to discredit climate science. He\nsaid that it was not a single scandal, but \"a sustained and coordinated\ncampaign\" aimed at undermining the credibility of the science.\nDisproportionate reporting of the original story, \"widely amplified by climate\ndeniers\", meant that the reports that cleared the scientists received far less\ncoverage than the original allegations, he said.^[139] Journalist Curtis\nBrainard of the Columbia Journalism Review criticised newspapers and magazines\nfor failing to give prominent coverage to the findings of the review panels\nand said that \"readers need to understand that while there is plenty of room\nto improve the research and communications process, its fundamental tenets\nremain as solid as ever\".^[140] CNN media critic Howard Kurtz expressed\nsimilar sentiments.^[141]\n\nIn June 2021, the BBC reported that Climategate would be the subject of a film\nentitled The Trick with actors Jason Watkins, George MacKay, Victoria\nHamilton, Jerome Flynn and Adrian Edmondson.^[142]\n\nIn November 2021, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a five-part series, The Hack that\nChanged the World, about the issue; it was presented by BBC Security\nCorrespondent Gordon Corera.^[143]\n\n## Public opinion and political fallout[edit]\n\nJon Krosnick, professor of communication, political science and psychology at\nStanford University, said that scientists were overreacting. Referring to his\nown poll results of the American public, he said: \"It's another funny instance\nof scientists ignoring science.\" Krosnick found that \"Very few professions\nenjoy the level of confidence from the public that scientists do, and those\nnumbers haven't changed much in a decade. We don't see a lot of evidence that\nthe general public in the United States is picking up on the (University of\nEast Anglia) emails. It's too inside baseball.\"^[144]\n\nThe Christian Science Monitor, in an article titled \"Climate scientists\nexonerated in 'climategate' but public trust damaged\", stated: \"While public\nopinion had steadily moved away from belief in man-made global warming before\nthe leaked CRU emails, that trend has only accelerated.\"^[145] Paul Krugman,\ncolumnist for The New York Times, argued that this, along with all other\nincidents that called into question the scientific consensus on climate\nchange, was \"a fraud concocted by opponents of climate action, then bought\ninto by many in the news media\".^[146] But UK journalist Fred Pearce called\nthe slow response of climate scientists \"a case study in how not to respond to\na crisis\" and \"a public relations disaster\".^[147]\n\nA. A. Leiserowitz, Director of the Yale University Project on Climate Change,\nand colleagues found in 2010 that:^[6]\n\n> Climategate had a significant effect on public beliefs in global warming and\n> trust in scientists. The loss of trust in scientists, however, was primarily\n> among individuals with a strongly individualistic worldview or politically\n> conservative ideology. Nonetheless, Americans overall continue to trust\n> scientists more than other sources of information about global warming.\n\nIn late 2011, Steven F. Hayward wrote that \"Climategate did for the global\nwarming controversy what the Pentagon Papers did for the Vietnam war 40 years\nago: It changed the narrative decisively.\"^[148] An editorial in Nature said\nthat many in the media \"were led by the nose, by those with a clear agenda, to\na sizzling scandal that steadily defused as the true facts and context were\nmade clear\".^[149]\n\n## Further release, 2011[edit]\n\nOn 22 November 2011, a second set of approximately 5,000 emails, apparently\nhacked from University of East Anglia servers at the same time as those in the\n2009 release, was posted on a Russian server, with links distributed to the\nmessage boards on several climate-sceptic websites.^[150] A message\naccompanying the emails quoted selective passages from them, highlighting many\nof the same issues raised following the original incident. Juliette Jowit and\nLeo Hickman of The Guardian said that the new release was \"an apparent attempt\nto undermine public support for international action to tackle climate change\"\nwith the start of the 2011 United Nations Climate Change Conference scheduled\nin Durban, South Africa, a week later.^[150]^[151] Nature described the\nfurther release as a \"poor sequel\" and claimed that \"it is hard for anyone\nexcept the most committed conspiracy theorist to see much of interest in the\ncontent of the released e-mails, even taken out of context\".^[149]\n\n## Further reading[edit]\n\n  * James Lawrence Powell, (2011) The Inquisition of Climate Science, Columbia University Press.\n  * Fred Pearce, (2010) The Climate Files: The Battle for the Truth about Global Warming, Guardian Books; London.\n  * Maibach, Edward; Leiserowitz, Anthony; Cobb, Sara; Shank, Michael; Cobb, Kim M.; Gulledge, Jay (May 2012). \"The legacy of climategate: undermining or revitalizing climate science and policy?\".
