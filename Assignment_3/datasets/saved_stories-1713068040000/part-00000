Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n# Jim Keller suggests Nvidia should have used Ethernet to stitch together\nBlackwell GPUs \u2014 Nvidia could have saved billions\n\nNews\n\nBy Anton Shilov\n\npublished 9 hours ago\n\nSuitable for programmability and for porting to other platforms.\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nAs a strong supporter of open standards, Jim Keller tweeted that Nvidia should\nhave used the Ethernet protocol chip-to-chip connectivity in Blackwell-based\nGB200 GPUs for AI and HPC. Keller contends this could have saved Nvidia and\nusers of its hardware a lot of money. It would have also made it a bit easier\nfor those customers to migrate their software to different hardware platforms,\nwhich Nvidia doesn't necessarily want.\n\nWhen Nvidia introduced its GB200 GPU for AI and HPC applications, the company\nprimarily focused on its AI performance and advanced memory subsystem, telling\nlittle about how the device was made. Meanwhile, Nvidia's GB200 GPU comprises\ntwo compute processors stitched together using TSMC's CoWoS-L packaging\ntechnology and the NVLink interconnection technology, which uses a proprietary\nprotocol. This isn't an issue for those who already use Nvidia's hardware and\nsoftware, but this poses a challenge for the industry in porting software from\nNvidia's platforms.\n\n(Image credit: Jim Keller)\n\nThere is a reason why Jim Keller, a legendary CPU designer and chief executive\nofficer of Tenstorrent, an Nvidia rival, suggests that Nvidia should have used\nEthernet instead of proprietary NVLink. Nvidia's platforms use proprietary\nlow-latency NVLink for chip-to-chip and server-to-server communications (which\ncompete against PCIe with the CXL protocol on top) and proprietary InfiniBand\nconnections for higher-tier comms. To maximize performance, the software is\ntuned for both technologies' peculiarities. For obvious reasons, this could\nsomewhat complicate software porting to other hardware platforms, which is\ngood for Nvidia and not exactly suitable for its competitors.

Ethernet is a ubiquitous technology both on the\nhardware and software level, and it is a competitor to Nvidia's low-latency\nand high-bandwidth (up to 200 GbE) InfiniBand interconnection for data\ncenters. Performance-wise, Ethernet (particularly next-generation 400 GbE and\n800 GbE) can compete with InfiniBand.\n\nHowever, InfiniBand still has some advantages regarding features for AI and\nHPC and superior tail latencies, so some might say that Ethernet's\ncapabilities don't cater to emerging AI and HPC workloads. Meanwhile, the\nindustry \u2014 spearheaded by AMD, Broadcom, Intel, Meta, Microsoft, and Oracle \u2014\nis developing the Ultra Ethernet interconnection technology, poised to offer\nhigher throughput and features for AI and HPC communications. Of course, Ultra\nEthernet will become a more viable competitor to Nvidia's InfiniBand for these\nsorts of workloads.\n\nNvidia also faces challenges with its CUDA software platform dominance, hence\nthe advent of the widely industry-supported Unified Accelerator Foundation\n(UXL), an industry consortium that includes Arm, Intel, Qualcomm, and Samsung,\namong others, that's intended to provide an alternative to CUDA.\n\nOf course, Nvidia needs to develop data center platforms to use here and now,\nwhich is probably at least part of its desire to spend billions on proprietary\ntechnologies. If open-standard technologies like PCIe with CXL and Ultra\nEthernet will outpace Nvidia's proprietary NVLink and InfiniBand technologies\nregarding performance and capabilities, Nvidia will have to redevelop its\nplatforms, so Keller advises (or trolls) that Nvidia should adopt Ethernet.\nHowever, this may be years away, so for now, Nvidia's designs continue to\nleverage proprietary interconnects.\n\n## Stay on the Cutting Edge\n\nJoin the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC\ntech news \u2014 and have for over 25 years.

In that they are building roadblocks against\nanother competitor having the chance to compete and win over the customer,\nthus creating a de facto monopoly in a certain market. Only the anti-trust\ncase must be looked at on a per-capita basis being locked into the company\u2019s\necosystem instead of simply from the classical \u201clack of competitor in the\nmarket-place\u201d basis.\n\nEx: if Nvidia sells to 80% of the datacenter customers, and let\u2019s say Intel or\nAMD come out with superior products incompatible with Nvidia\u2019s required\nsecondary hardware/connectivity/etc., if the only reason Intel and AMD cannot\nwin over any part of the Nvidia 80% is because customers state they had to buy\nexpensive proprietary Nvidia secondaries to use their current Nvidia hardware\nand abandoning Nvidia would incur losing all the investment in proprietary\nNvidia secondaries, then that is a \u201cDeFacto Monopoly\u201d on 80% of the market,\nnot because Nvidia is more competitive, but because of an artificial \u201cball and\nchain\u201d arresting customers. All while their competitors offer better products\nusing open source secondaries.\n\nMaybe I\u2019ve had too much coffee, but when I read this article, this idea popped\nin my head and I rolled with it lol.\n\nReply\n\n  * hotaru251\n\n> The Historical Fidelity said:\n>\n> with superior products incompatible with Nvidia\u2019s required secondary\n> hardware/connectivity/etc\n\nI mean they do go out of there way to do so. https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA\nwas made that let AMD gpu's (some not all) run CUDA on non nvidia\ngpu's...nvidia updated their licensing agreement to make that agasint the\nterms of use.\n\nThat \"could\" potentially be used in a case if it ever got to that point.\n\nReply\n\n  * thisisaname\n\nWas the next generation of Ethernet out when they where designing it?\n\nReply\n\n  * Alvar \"Miles\" Udell\n\n> Keller contends this could have saved Nvidia and users of its hardware a lot\n> of money.\n\nExcept it wouldn't save users any money, it'd just increase nVidia's profit\nmargin if what he says is true.\n\nReply\n\n  * ezst036\n\n> hotaru251 said:\n>\n> if that leaked memo a while ago was anything to go by Jensen entirely wants\n> to be like Apple.\n\nI agree. Though, to be fair, it is always the leaders who take the arrows.\nNvidia and Apple respectively, are the unrefuted leaders in their domains.\n\nThe most hilarious thing I think though is how Apple for years refused to have\nany dealings whatsoever with Nvidia, only supporting AMD(ATi) video cards\nthroughout the decade, beginning around 2010. Nvidia was entirely outmoded in\nMohave.\n\nApple's schemes of vendor lock-in found a hard deadlock against Nvidia's\nschemes of vendor lock-in. hehehe\n\nReply\n\n  * edzieba\n\n> thisisaname said:\n>\n> Was the next generation of Ethernet out when they where designing it?\n\nNo. And back when NVLink was developed, Ethernet was still limited to 10\nGigabit (the 25 Gigabit alliance had not even formed yet) and lacked the\nlatency and coherency requirements for inter-chip communication.\n\nThe headline could effectively read \"Jim Keller suggests Nvidia could reduce\nchip costs using time travel\".\n\nReply\n\n  * hotaru251\n\n> ezst036 said:\n>\n> Nvidia and Apple respectively, are the unrefuted leaders in their domains.\n\nApple isn't. Apples a brand more than unmatched products.\n\n> ezst036 said:\n>\n> Apple for years refused to have any dealings whatsoever with Nvidia\n\nnot really. that bad blood was due to business co-op blame game and made total\nsense.\n\nReply\n\n  * AmazingGoose\n\nBlackwell NVLink supports 1.8TBps. Is there an Ethernet equivalent to\n14.4Tbps? Even with some form of bonded or multichannel link, I'd be surprised\nif such an Ethernet solution exists.\n\nReply\n\n##### Most Popular\n\nFirst AI-generated rom-com is due this summer -- and the trailer puts Hallmark\nChannel to shame\n\nNanotronics promises modular, shippable chip fab facilities powered by Nvidia\nGPUs and AI\n\nRTX 4090s continue to melt \u2014 GPU repair facility claims it works on 200\nflagship Nvidia cards per month\n\nChinese gamers can't RMA their RTX 4090s due to US sanctions \u2014 users are being\nvery careful with how they treat their top-tier GPUs\n\nNearly 90% of chips used in Russia come from China despite US sanctions:\nReport\n\nCritical EUV chipmaking tool supplier hacked, pressed to pay $10 million for\nransomware unlock \u2013 Hoya dismisses hack as an \u2018IT system incident\u2019\n\nNvidia blames Intel for GPU VRAM errors, tells GeForce gamers experiencing\n13th or 14th Gen CPU instability to contact Intel support\n\nUbuntu 24.04 Beta released after week delay due to malicious code\n\nRaspberry Pi Pico brings Gundam to life with interactive LED light show\n\nApple M4 processor family tipped to deliver AI focus \u2014 three next-gen chips\nbelieved to be nearing production\n\nXYZA Tiny Keyboard Custom 2.0 launched \u2014 offers three customizable keys plus a\ndial\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and\nleading digital publisher.
