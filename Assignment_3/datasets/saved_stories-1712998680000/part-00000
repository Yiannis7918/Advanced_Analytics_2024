The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) approved a request by\nthe state\u2019s largest investor-owned utilities to cut compensation to customers\nthat export excess solar generation to the grid, a process called net energy\nmetering.\n\nNet metering rates were rapidly cut by 80% under NEM 3.0. This change,\ncombined with a high interest rate environment, has pushed the state\u2019s robust\nrooftop solar industry off a cliff, damaging the return on investment for\nhomeowners, and leading to more than 17,000 solar jobs lost, demand falling\n80% post-implementation, and numerous companies filing for bankruptcy.\n\n\u201cThe commission\u2019s new rooftop solar policy enables the utilities\u2019 self-\ninterested attack on rooftop solar,\u201d said Bill Powers, an energy expert with\nThe Protect Our Communities Foundation. \u201cThe real problem is heedless pursuit\nof maximum profit by the utilities at the expense of reasonable rates and\ncommonsense climate action.\u201d\n\nThe petition under review raises the question: \u201cBy ignoring the acknowledged\nsocietal and other benefits of customer-sited renewable generation and\nassigning value solely to limited economic benefits, did the Commission fail\nto proceed in the manner required by section 2827.1(b)(3), which mandates that\na net energy metering tariff must be \u2018based on the costs and benefits of the\nrenewable electrical generation facility?\u2019\u201d\n\nRooftop solar offers \u201cmyriad benefits for the environment and consumers,\u201d said\na report from Environment America. This includes reducing the need for dirty\npower plants and expensive transmission lines, providing lower costs, and\nincreasing the grid\u2019s resilience to extreme weather and other shocks.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision is a ray of hope for rooftop solar at a time\nwhen plummeting installations and massive layoffs are wrecking this vital\nindustry and jeopardizing California\u2019s climate goals,\u201d said Roger Lin, a\nsenior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity.\n\nAnalysis from the California Solar and Storage Association (CALSSA) shows that\nthe state is unlikely to meet its clean energy targets without a robust\nrooftop solar market. The California Energy Commission (CEC) projects that the\nstate will need to build 6 GW of solar-plus-storage every year for the next 26\nyears straight to meet the 2045 target. Over the past five years, California\nhas only averaged about half of the 6 GW deployment figure.\n\n\u201cWe started to get on pace in the past two years, but it is driven at least\n50% by the distributed [rooftop solar] market,\u201d said CALSSA executive director\nBernadette del Chiaro.\n\nCPUC moved forward with NEM 3.0 despite filed requests for delays to run a\ncomplete cost-benefit analysis of the rate structure that considers non-energy\nbenefits of distributed rooftop solar. Critics of the regulatory proceeding\nallege that the decision was made on internal data and analysis from the\nstate\u2019s largest investor-owned utilities.\n\nA report from the Center for Biological Diversity explains why utilities are\nmotivated to gut rooftop solar and maintain their traditional profit model.\n\nRead more on California\u2019s electricity multi-crisis and the potential role for\ndistributed technologies like rooftop solar and battery energy storage virtual\npower plants to help alleviate the state\u2019s problems.\n\nThis content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.

I don\u2019t know\nwho approved this as Pge actually burned some cities and killed many people!\nWho granted this and why! No normal business would allow this! The governor\nshould address this and ALL new fees rolled back. This is what is needed\nasap!! Randy Baker Danville\n\nReply\n\n  2. Gregory Sittler says:\n\nApril 11, 2024 at 11:19 pm\n\nIs anyone in the CA legislature listening to anyone besides their campaign\ncontributors? Does anyone care what we want if we\u2019re not handing them money to\nhear us? How much does it co$t to get the hearing aids turned on? How long do\nwe have to be bullied by the rich shareholders into doing the wrong thing to\nour planet just to provide them with bloody profits? Why can\u2019t we get to doing\nthe right thing for everybody, instead of just the PROFITABLE thing for the\nfew?\n\nReply\n\n  3. Richard Mercer says:\n\nApril 12, 2024 at 12:04 am\n\nBecause California has the biggest rooftop solar market in the U.S., this is\nreally hurting all the companies involved with rooftop solar.\n\n\u201cOn Thursday, the California Solar and Storage Association unveiled data\nshowing a 77 to 85 percent drop in rooftop solar projects since April. That\u2019s\nwhen the California Public Utilities Commission\u2019s controversial \u2019net metering\n3.0\u2032 decision.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/californias-rooftop-solar-policy-\nis-killing-its-rooftop-solar-industry\n\nReply\n\n  4. Jerry says:\n\nApril 12, 2024 at 10:57 am\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about single-family residential rooftop solar. It\u2019s much\nbigger. Utility monopoly shareholder solutions to the renewable energy\ntransition are all based on very large utility scale generation & storage\ninstallations that they bill to customers. That requires more new &/or\nupgrades to expensive transmission infrastructure, again, billed to\ncustomers.....That\u2019s the utility monopoly shareholder business model.\n\nLarge multi-family residential & commercial rooftop & parking lot canopy solar\n+stationary storage batteries +Vehicle-2-Grid EV chargers installed behind the\nutility meter don\u2019t require any new utility transmission, site acquisition,\nother site improvement spending, or utility inter-connection & NIMBY\nopposition delays........just ordinary local building permits.\n\nReply\n\n  5. Jay says:\n\nApril 12, 2024 at 11:43 am\n\nNET meeting was the stupidiest thing to allow in the first place. Many states\ndid the same thing. If we want to encourage going green the more you should\nnot be limited on what is sold back to utility company.\n\nReply\n\n#### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nPlease be mindful of our community standards.\n\nBy submitting this form you agree to pv magazine using your data for the\npurposes of publishing your comment.\n\nYour personal data will only be disclosed or otherwise transmitted to third\nparties for the purposes of spam filtering or if this is necessary for\ntechnical maintenance of the website.
