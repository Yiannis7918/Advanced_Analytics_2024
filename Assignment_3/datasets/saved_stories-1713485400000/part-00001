Wing and the Anthropocene Working Group\n\nThe concept of the Anthropocene epoch was born in February 2000 out of a\nmoment of spontaneity. Chemist and Nobel Prize winner Paul Crutzen had been\nlistening to a narrative emerging at an international convening of scientists\nin Mexico.\n\nAll day, scientists had presented data that showed how the human-caused\nchanges in climate, chemical cycles and biology of recent decades were\njarringly different from the relative stability of the Holocene, the\ngeological epoch that began 11,700 years prior. They kept referring to the\nremarkably rapid environmental changes of the late Holocene.\n\nExasperated, Crutzen finally broke into the discussion: \u201cWe aren\u2019t in the\nHolocene anymore, we\u2019re in ... the Anthropocene!\u201d The improvised term quickly\ncaught fire as a foundational concept among earth scientists, and in the last\ndecade the word has proliferated through other sciences, the arts, humanities\nand popular culture.\n\nAlong the way, \u201cAnthropocene\u201d gained many meanings and implications unrelated\nto\u2014or even opposing\u2014Crutzen\u2019s original concept, blurring and sometimes wholly\nobscuring its original meaning. But what did Crutzen intend by the\nAnthropocene, a concept since enhanced and refined by years of scientific\nstudy?\n\nIt\u2019s absurdly simple. The shift from the Holocene to the Anthropocene epoch\nhits like a brick wall when looking at graphs that show changes in three major\ngreenhouse gases and in global temperature during the last 30 millennia. All\nfour of these critical planetary parameters shift from near-horizontal to\nnear-vertical lines in the last 70 years or so. The graphs are simple, but\nthey show changes in atmospheric chemistry and\u2014lagging a little\nbehind\u2014temperature, that affect the habitability of the planet for all its\norganisms, including humans. On a time scale of millennia, the shifts don\u2019t\nresemble a hockey stick as much as a stair step. Furthermore, these changes\naffect the whole atmosphere and ocean, so they are essentially irreversible on\nany human time scale. Our distant descendants will still be living with the\nplanetary changes that humans have wrought in a single lifetime.\n\nThe stunning effect of humans on the atmosphere can be seen in the\nconcentration of three important greenhouse gases: nitrous oxide, methane and\ncarbon dioxide. These gases have increased far more in the last 70 years than\nin the previous 30,000 years or more. Global temperature has begun to spike as\na result, and it will continue to rise as the full effect of higher greenhouse\ngas concentration is felt. Martin Head\n\nIf we zoom in on the time axis to look at just the last 300 years, ten human\ngenerations, we see remarkably large and rapid change in a whole range of\nfactors that mark the effect of humans at a global scale: not just carbon\nemissions, but also production of metals, plastics, fertilizers, concrete and\nfarm animals, and even a giant increase in the ultimate geological currency:\nsediment. The amount of sediment moved every year by humans now exceeds the\namount moved by non-human processes by a factor of 15.\n\nCropping the time frame tightly in this way, we see that the global shifts are\nmost rapid beginning in the mid-20th century. The Anthropocene Working Group,\na body of 34 scientists from 14 countries constituted in 2009 by the\nInternational Commission on Stratigraphy, proposed placing the beginning of a\nnew Anthropocene Epoch in 1952, when sediments are marked globally by the\nfirst major increase in the element plutonium, derived from the earliest tests\nof thermonuclear weapons.\n\nScientists proposed recognizing a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene,\nmarked by rapid changes beginning in the mid-20th century. Sediments deposited\nin the last 70 years are marked by abundant artificial materials including\nconcrete, metals, plastics and fertilizer. Ecosystems have also been\ntransformed by the great increases in fertilizer production (ammonia) and\nraising livestock (meat production). Humans are also prodigious producers of\nsediment. Colin Waters\n\nBy proposing a formal, geologically defined Anthropocene epoch, the working\ngroup intended to provide a precise definition for this recent, large,\npermanent and rapid transition in Earth\u2019s physical, chemical and biological\nsystems.\n\nThe proposal was rejected by the international hierarchy of stratigraphy\u2014of\nwhich the International Commission on Stratigraphy is a part\u2014without citing\nsubstantive reasons, but most public criticisms of the Anthropocene stem from\na range of sources: from within the heart of geology, to well outside it,\namong the social sciences and humanities.\n\nTourists look down at the Hoover Dam. The amount of sediment settled behind\nthe world\u2019s thousands of big dams would cover all of California to a depth of\nfive meters. Robert Nickelsberg / Getty Images\n\nAcross a spectrum of disciplines, the Anthropocene touched\u2014and often jabbed\u2014a\nnerve: sometimes as a gut response to a disturbing new idea and sometimes with\ndiscomfort at unfamiliar sociopolitical implications. For whatever reasons,\nthe Anthropocene came under fire.\n\nBut the barrage of criticism has often focused on what the Anthropocene isn\u2019t\nrather than what it is. Fundamental misconceptions have come to surround this\nconcept and to cloud its meaning. Here we debunk ten common myths about the\nAnthropocene.\n\n## 1\\. The Anthropocene fails to represent all human impacts.\n\nThis is true enough\u2014but it misses the point entirely. Recognizing an\nAnthropocene epoch does not at all underplay the impacts that humans have\ncaused for many millennia by hunting, by farming, and by building cities and\ntrade networks. But those early impacts were not global, were not synchronous\naround the planet and did not shift the global environment permanently. The\nreason for naming a new geological epoch, both in Crutzen\u2019s original\nformulation and in the highly detailed proposal of the working group, is to\nmark the departure of the Earth and its inhabitants from the stable planetary\nsystem of the Holocene. The Anthropocene epoch was never meant to encompass\nall anthropogenic impacts.\n\n## 2\\. The Anthropocene is too short to be a geological epoch\u2014just one human\nlifetime.\n\nThe Anthropocene\u2019s duration is short, true\u2014so far. But it\u2019s the Holocene that\nshows the greatest change in duration from other epochs: nearly three orders\nof magnitude (0.0117 million years versus 2.57 million years for the\nPleistocene epoch that precedes it). The difference in duration between\nHolocene and Anthropocene epochs is proportionately less, and the Anthropocene\nrepresents far more significant and enduring change to the planet than does\nthe Holocene.\n\n## 3\\. The Anthropocene is just a blip in Earth history.\n\nOr, as the New York Times writes, a senior member of the geological time-scale\nhierarchy calls it \u201ca blip of a blip of a blip.\u201d What this point of view\nmisunderstands is that these approximately 70 years have altered the planet\nfundamentally and set it on a new trajectory. Already, many geological signals\nare sharper than, and as pronounced as, the sudden carbon release and global\nwarming that initiated the Eocene epoch 56 million years ago.\n\nTake just the climate impacts from burning fossil fuels, of which 90 percent\nhave been burned in the last 70 years. These impacts will roll across the\nplanet for at least many thousands of years. We and many generations to come\nare locked into a climate unlike that of the Holocene. Carbon dioxide already\nin the atmosphere will make the Earth hotter than it has been for at least 3\nmillion years. Many of the biological changes of the last 70 years are\npermanent, too: extinctions, of course, but also the spread of many species\nthrough the intended and unintended assistance of humans, making fauna and\nflora more homogeneous worldwide. The biosphere has been changed forever. This\nis no blip.\n\n## 4\\. Anthropocene strata are \u201cminimal\u201d or \u201cnegligible.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a very geological objection\u2014but it\u2019s wrong. Humans have, since the\nmid-20th century, been prodigious reshapers of the landscape and movers of\nrock and sediment (now, by more than an order of magnitude than natural\nsediment movers such as glaciers and rivers.) The amount of sediment settled\nbehind the world\u2019s thousands of big dams would cover all of California to a\ndepth of five meters, and such sediments are full of distinctive markers, like\npesticide residues, metals, microplastics and the fossils of invasive species.\nTo define a time period formally, geologists must identify distinctive signals\nin sediments or rocks that can be correlated around the globe, and the\npresence of such markers is ubiquitous. The geology is real.\n\nPlastic debris collects after a rainstorm near Culver City, California.\nMicroplastics that result from such debris can often be found in sediment.\nCitizen of the Planet / UIG via Getty Images\n\n## 5\\. The geological record is too complex and gradational to draw one single\nboundary for the Anthropocene.\n\nAll of history (of Earth and of humans) is complex, is gradational and varies\nthrough time and across space. Nevertheless, geologists define epochs because\nsuch time units are useful, indeed indispensable to their work. In geology,\neach time unit is precisely defined by a \u201cgolden spike\u201d\u2014a specified level in a\nsedimentary succession at a specified location that is chosen because it can\nbe correlated to other sedimentary sequences around the globe. This golden\nspike identifies a global time plane, but the planetary transition that\nmotivates the placement of a golden spike can be anything but simple.\n\nThe last ice age of the Pleistocene gave way to Holocene interglacial\nconditions over the course of about 13,000 years\u2014and took a different course\nbetween Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Yet the defined Holocene boundary\nwithin that transition, at 11,700 years ago, is accepted and used without\ncomplaint. The Holocene-Anthropocene transition is much sharper and more\nglobally synchronous, and so is easier to define and recognize.\n\n## 6\\. Other animals have affected the environment and caused geological\nchange, so there\u2019s nothing special about the Anthropocene.\n\nOther animals have indeed changed the environment, but that can help rather\nthan hinder the recognition of geological time intervals. For instance, the\nrise of mobile, muscular animals that could burrow through sediment serves as\nthe basis for defining the Cambrian Period. But none of those previous changes\nhas swept across all environments on the planet so quickly\u2014or been triggered\nby an animal conscious of the changes it was making. This consciousness, we\nnote, is yet to be effectively translated into action to ward off the worst\nconsequences of these changes. Too many still pursue economic and industrial\ndevelopment without considering the long-term cost to planetary health.\n\n## 7\\. The Anthropocene blames all humans equally for the global environmental\ncrises.\n\nThe Anthropocene assigns neither blame nor credit; it simply recognizes a\ngreat, abrupt and more or less permanent change to the course of Earth\nhistory. There is no doubt that some humans, societies, institutions and\nnation-states have driven far more change than others, and that the benefits\nand costs of change have been and are unevenly distributed. The societal value\nof the Anthropocene epoch is that it announces the unambiguous scientific\nevidence showing that humans have permanently changed the global environment.\nAnd it might encourage us to recognize that we all must deal with the rapid,\npermanent, global changes that are underway.\n\n## 8\\. The Anthropocene signals defeat in our efforts to mitigate\nenvironmental change.\n\nThe first step in solving problems is to diagnose them. We cannot return the\nEarth to the conditions in which our grandparents or any other Holocene\ngeneration lived. But we can make wiser decisions about the future that will\nameliorate and mitigate change. That\u2019s realism, not defeatism.\n\n## 9\\. Naming the Anthropocene after humans is hubristic.\n\nThe planetary transformation that ushered in the Anthropocene epoch was caused\nby humans. It could have been called a lot of things, but Anthropocene caught\nthe imagination of many because its meaning is evident and accurate.\n\n## 10\\. The Anthropocene is just a publicity stunt.\n\nIf only that were true. Accepting that we are no longer living in a Holocene\nworld is a first step in addressing the issues facing humans and non-humans in\nthe immediate future.\n\nThese myths have persisted in the scientific community despite being\nsystematically refuted in scientific papers by the Anthropocene Working Group\nand others. This suggests that, like all myths, they are reactions based on\nideology, conviction or personal philosophy rather than evidence. These\nmisconceptions lie at the heart, too, of the recent formal rejection of the\nAnthropocene epoch by the hierarchy of international stratigraphy.\n\nWhy has the Anthropocene been misunderstood and mythologized in so many ways?\nProbably because it\u2019s deeply uncomfortable to many. It\u2019s very brief (so far).\nIt includes smelly landfill sites as strata to \u201cfoul up\u201d a geological time\nscale that is sacrosanct to many geologists. And it raises the specter that\nthe calm abstractions of geological time have come up against the tough\npredicaments we face in the present and future.\n\nChange is hard, and the Anthropocene is an uncomfortable concept. It is hard\nto accept that we as a society have gained so much power to change the Earth\nand have thought so little about how to use that power. Scientific knowledge\ncan transform our perspectives (think of heliocentrism and evolution)\u2014so it\u2019s\nnot surprising that the Anthropocene is hard to accept. But, recognizing our\nrole in suddenly, recently driving the Earth towards a new future is a\nnecessary first step to engaging with the planetary changes we have set in\ntrain.\n\nGet the latest on what's happening At the Smithsonian in your inbox.\n\nJan Zalasiewicz | READ MORE\n\nJan Zalasiewicz is emeritus professor of paleobiology at the University of\nLeicester in the United Kingdom and a member of the Anthropocene Working\nGroup.
