Launched\nin 2011, Siri was introduced as heralding a new era in human-computer\ninteraction, offering an intuitive voice-controlled interface for accessing\ninformation, scheduling appointments, sending messages, and much more. The\nvision was grand: A personal assistant in your pocket, capable of\nunderstanding and acting upon a wide array of voice commands with ease and\naccuracy. So what happened?\n\nEnthusiasm for Siri has undeniably waned in the intervening years. Despite\nregular updates and improvements from Apple, Siri has struggled to keep pace\nwith its advancing rivals, and in an era of generative AI chatbots and large\nlanguage models, Siri's failings have only been magnified. Issues ranging from\nmisinterpreted commands to limited contextual understanding have not only\nhindered Siri's usability but have also led to an almost universal perception\nof the virtual assistant as a source of user frustration rather than\nassistance. This persistent underperformance begs the question: Is it time for\nApple to kill Siri and start over?\n\n## Siri's Birth Pangs\n\nSiri's conceptual roots at Apple can be traced back to the company's early\nexploration of human-computer interaction. Thirty years ago, Apple\ncommissioned a group of employees to create a video showing how in the future\nhumans might interact with computers using spoken language. The video, known\nas \"Knowledge Navigator,\" featured a professor chatting with a virtual\nassistant to perform everyday tasks and academic research. In one of the\ntasks, the professor asks the assistant to search for a five-year-old\npublication. The assistant pulls up an article dated 2006, suggesting the\nvideo is supposed to be set in September 2011.\n\nThe video was criticized at the time for being an unrealistic portrayal of the\ncapacities of a virtual assistant in the foreseeable future. Yet the\ndemonstration inspired developers Adam Cheyer, Dag Kittlaus, and Tom Gruber,\nwho began AI research on virtual assistants at SRI International, a DARPA-\nfunded research laboratory in Menlo Park, California. Their work would result\nin a spin-out called Siri, named by Kittlaus after a co-worker in Norway.\n(Siri is short for Sigrid, which has its origins in Old Norse for words\nmeaning \"victory\" and \"beautiful\".)\n\nIn February 2010, Kittlaus launched Siri as an app on Apple's App Store. Steve\nJobs soon began playing with the app and was impressed with how it allowed the\nuser to search the internet by voice. A few weeks later, Apple acquired the\nstart-up. Siri's AI backend was in place, while its voice recognition\ntechnology would be supplied by Nuance Communications. Apple subsequently\nreleased its Siri virtual assistant (in beta) for the iPhone 4S in October\n2011, just one month later than the fictional future in which Knowledge\nNavigator had been originally envisioned.\n\n## Fiction vs. Reality\n\nApple marketed Siri as more than just a tool \u2014 it was your intelligent\nassistant ready to help with a variety of tasks. Whether setting reminders,\nsending texts, making phone calls, or finding information online, Siri aimed\nto streamline it all with a simple voice command. There was nothing like it at\nthe time and the initial results were impressive, but the underlying promise\nwas that Siri would not only understand you but also learn from you, becoming\nmore efficient and personalized over time.\n\nRegular iOS updates in the intervening years have worked towards making Siri\nmore effective and realizing its original promise. Whenever a new iOS feature\ncomes along, Apple usually ensures that it works with Siri, and these days it\ncan be used to identify songs, get driving directions, send money via Apple\nPay, and control HomeKit products, to name just a few of its skills. In 2021,\nApple announced that Siri would work offline by default \u2013 whenever possible,\nit would process user requests on-device, with the same quality of server-\nbased speech recognition.\n\nHowever, even now, the assistant that was supposed to understand context and\ngrow with the user still faces significant challenges with context,\nunderstanding, and integration, regardless of whether it pings Apple's servers\nor processes requests locally. Many Apple device owners often say it struggles\nwith even basic commands. Indeed, many users believe that, at least in some\nareas, Siri's abilities have gotten worse over time, especially since the\nrelease of iOS 17.\n\n> It is astounding how bad it is. Even things that used to work fine like\n> asking Siri to send a text message now don\u2019t seem to work consistently\n> anymore. Sometimes she asks me if I want to use the phone number or email,\n> and other times it just tries to call the person. Sigh. \u2014 Joseph Bella\n> (@jbella) March 20, 2024\n\nMichael Tsai's blog has done a good job of recording users' more recent\nfrustrations with Siri. Here are just a handful of serial issues some users\nhave recently reported:\n\n  * Setting timers instead of alarms.\n  * Bungling music requests (even for purchases that Siri has local access to).\n  * Delayed responses over fast data connections.\n  * Nonsense responses to conversion requests.\n  * Creating notes instead of reminders.\n  * Acknowledging requests without acting on them.\n  * Overwrought punctuation when dictating.\n  * Inability to consistently control smart devices.\n\nThe list could go on. But has Siri really gotten more stupid? Could most\nissues be put down to fringe use cases, or over-expectations in a brave new\nworld of chatbots powered by immensely resource-heavy large-language models?\nConsider what Walt Mossberg said in 2016, writing for The Verge:\n\n> Before Apple bought it, Siri was on the road to being a robust digital\n> assistant that could do many things, and integrate with many services \u2014 even\n> though it was being built by a startup with limited funds and people. After\n> Apple bought Siri, the giant company seemed to treat it as a backwater,\n> restricting it to doing only a few, slowly increasing number of tasks, like\n> telling you the weather, sports scores, movie and restaurant listings, and\n> controlling the device's functions.\n>\n> ...On too many occasions, Siri either gets things wrong, doesn't know the\n> answer, or can't verbalize it. Instead, it shows you a web search result,\n> even when you're not in a position to read it.\n\nMany users would agree that very little has changed in the past eight years.\n\n## AI Hopes on the Horizon\n\nApple's next major software update, iOS 18, is rumored to include new\ngenerative AI features for Siri that will assist users in their daily lives.\n\"Generative AI\" is the key term here. The concept surged in popularity in late\n2022, when OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot that can reply to questions and\nprompts with unnervingly nuanced human-like responses. The company has since\nexpanded into generative AI tools for images and videos.\n\nOne leaker has suggested that Apple is planning to use large-language models\nto entirely revamp Siri and turn it into the \"ultimate virtual assistant.\"\nRumors suggest that improvements could come in the form of better natural\nconversation capabilities (potentially aided by an improved iPhone microphone)\nand improved user personalization. The new functionality is expected to be\navailable across devices, so Siri may retain conversation information from one\ndevice to another. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, one of the specific\nfeatures Apple is developing is an improved interaction between Siri and the\nMessages app, which would let Siri auto-complete sentences more effectively\nand answer complex questions.\n\nHowever, more recent reports have claimed that Apple is not planning to debut\nits own generative AI chatbot. Apple has reportedly held discussions with\ncompanies such as Google, OpenAI, and Baidu about potential generative AI\npartnerships, but Apple's first set of new AI features in iOS 18 will not rely\non cloud servers at all, according to Gurman.\n\n## Move Over Siri?\n\nWhether or not a groundbreaking incarnation of Apple's virtual assistant is on\nthe cards, given the persistent issues that have tarnished Siri's reputation,\ncould a new name and branding help Apple distance itself from past failures?\n\nThe idea of rebranding Siri into something entirely new has been floated by\nsome observers in the tech world. Josh Johnson's blunt assessment echoes a\ncommon sentiment: \"I honestly think Apple should kill the Siri brand. I'm not\nsure it can recover from the universal understanding that it\u2019s just not good.\"\nHe suggests the introduction of an LLM-powered assistant under a new name,\nproposing a fresh start to overcome the negative associations that currently\nplague Siri.\n\nTy Belisle supports a drastic transformation, noting, \"I've thought they\nshould make a very bold 'Siri 2.0' announcement, but it's true the name Siri\nis so spoiled that they should ditch it.\" He also points out the practical\nbenefits of a new name, such as reducing accidental activations \u2014 a problem\nthat shorter names like \"Siri\" often face.\n\nJohn Gruber's perspective underscores the importance of first impressions and\nthe long-term effects of Siri's underwhelming performance: \"First impressions\nreally matter, but in Siri's case, it's over a decade of lived experience.\" If\nApple has significantly improved its voice technology, he argues, it should be\nintroduced under a new brand to signify a clean break from the past.\n\nThese voices present a compelling case for rebranding, but Apple would face\nsignificant risks if it introduced a new virtual assistant. Siri is deeply\nintegrated into Apple's ecosystem and recognized worldwide. Abandoning the\nbrand could confuse and alienate existing users who are accustomed to the name\nand functionality, despite its flaws. That being said, unlike Amazon's Alexa\nand Google's assistant, Siri has become the butt of numerous jokes. A new name\nand persona for the assistant could potentially revitalize its image, but\nApple would have to ensure that any new product lives up to its promises,\notherwise another misstep could be potentially disastrous.\n\nWhat are your thoughts about and experiences with Siri? Has its performance\ngotten better over time as Apple's software has become more complex, or is it\nin a death spiral?
