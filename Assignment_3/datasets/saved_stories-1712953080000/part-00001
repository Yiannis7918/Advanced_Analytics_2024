Now, with a deeper understanding\nand having watched developments very closely, we have real concerns,\" Sarah\nCardell, the chief executive of the CMA said.\n\n\"The essential challenge we face is how to harness this immensely exciting\ntechnology for the benefit of all, while safeguarding against potential\nexploitation of market power and unintended consequences.\"\n\nMs Cardell delivered the warning in a speech on Thursday in Washington.\n\nThe CMA said that a small number of incumbent technology firms - already\npowerful in the most important digital markets - were also now taking the lead\nwith foundation models.\n\nTrained on vast amounts of data, they underpin tools which are transforming\nworkplaces and other aspects of modern life.\n\n  * What is AI and how does it work?\n\nThe big tech firms have strong positions in terms of computing power, and\naccess skilled employees, the CMA said, and can influence access to the market\nthrough apps and platforms.\n\nThis could profoundly impact fair competition \"ultimately harming businesses\nand consumers, for example through reduced choice, lower quality, and higher\nprices, as well as stunting the flow of potentially unprecedented innovation\nand wider economic benefits from AI\", the CMA argued.\n\n## Pivotal moment\n\nThe CMA said it wanted to learn from previous experience in digital markets\nwhere \"winner takes all dynamics\" led to the rise of a small number of\npowerful platforms.\n\nIt said it was \"determined to apply the lessons of history\" at what it termed\na \"pivotal moment in the emergence of a new, potentially transformative\ntechnology.\"\n\nIn a new paper, it found more than 90 connected investments and partnerships\ninvolving the same small number of tech giants.\n\nThe watchdog is already undertaking a review of Microsoft's multi-billion\ndollar partnership with OpenAI.\n\nBut it said it recognised \"the huge wealth of resources, expertise and\ninnovation capability these large firms can bring to bear\".\n\nHowever, these should not \"insulate\" powerful firms from competition.\n\n## Microsoft-OpenAI ties under scrutiny by watchdog\n\n## What is AI and how does it work?\n\nArtificial intelligence\n\nCompetition and Markets Authority\n\nRelated\n\nWATCH\n\n## How AI and deepfakes are changing politics\n\n2 hrs ago\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\n## Millions of bat calls analysed by AI\n\n1 day ago\n\nGuernsey\n\n## How AI is helping to prevent future power cuts\n\n2 days ago\n\nBusiness\n\nMore\n\n27 Mar 2024\n\n## Budget fashion brands pledge clearer green claims\n\nAsos, Boohoo and George at Asda will make changes after intervention from the\ncompetition authority.\n\n27 Mar 2024\n\nBusiness\n\n22 Mar 2024\n\n## Vodafone-Three merger could lead to higher prices\n\nMerger of two of the UK's biggest mobile network providers could now face an\nin-depth investigation.\n\n22 Mar 2024\n\nTechnology\n\n26 Feb 2024\n\n## Housebuilders probed over sharing prices privately\n\nThe regulator finds evidence information may be being swapped, which could\naffect selling prices.\n\n26 Feb 2024\n\nBusiness\n\n20 Feb 2024\n\n## 'Too high' baby milk prices to be investigated\n\nParents could be saving up to \u00a3500 in a baby's first year, according to the UK\ncompetition watchdog.\n\n20 Feb 2024\n\nBusiness\n\n26 Jan 2024\n\n## Vodafone-Three merger faces competition probe\n\nThe Competition and Markets Authority will judge whether the deal would harm\nthe UK telecoms market.\n\n26 Jan 2024\n\nTechnology\n\nCopyright 2024 BBC.
