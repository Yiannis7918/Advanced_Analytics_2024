English III teaches you how to write things that English III teachers\nwant to read.\n\nI had to write an essay about Eudora Welty\u2019s short story Why I live at the\nP.O. If you haven\u2019t read it, don\u2019t fret. (Yes, the email program \u201cEudora\u201d is\nnamed after Welty.)\n\nNo one in the class understood what the story meant. It just seemed\nextraordinarily dull where nothing was happening, and then nothing happened,\nand then it ended. The teacher asked us what it meant; no one volunteered an\nanswer. I piped up: \u201cI really don\u2019t know. I\u2019d like to know but I don\u2019t.\u201d The\nteacher wasn\u2019t happy. The teacher\u2019s pet said the same. The teacher was so\ndisgusted with our lack of insight that she never did tell us the answer.\n\nSince I never learned to write well\u2014persuasively, with entertainment, with\ninterest\u2014I learned by copying.\n\nNot plagiarizing\u2014that\u2019s when you use someone else\u2019s words. Rather, I tried to\ncopy style. By copying I learned what I liked, what I had some ability to do.\n\nsource\n\nPasting style, not text.\n\nFor example, in Hello, I\u2019m 1074018628, a little ditty from 2008, I copied Seth\nGodin\u2019s style. It\u2019s 160 words. It makes a simple, solitary point. It runs\nright from specific example to overarching lesson bordering on a morality\ntale. At the end you\u2019re left inspired to improve yourself, and by extension\nimprove the world.\n\nExcept... when you think about how to implement your newfound inspiration, you\nhave no tools. The example is apt, but then again you\u2019re not that bad\u2014you\ndon\u2019t mail-merge numbers in MailChimp. And when you\u2019re trying to be creative\nand innovative, you realize that \u201cnot shitty\u201d isn\u2019t a goal. So then you re-\nread the post looking for guidance for how to be extraordinary, but saying \u201cbe\nthe opposite of shitty\u201d is not a lesson at all. It\u2019s just Seth (or me) staring\nback at you like my English III teacher, full of expectation and no answers.\n\nSo here\u2019s what I learned by copying Seth: I like evocative examples, but I\ndon\u2019t like leaving the reader without a framework for finding a solution. I\ncan\u2019t explore an interesting thought in only 160 words. I like trying to leave\nthe reader on an up-note. And I really did learn; see for example this article\nwhich exemplifies each of those specific lessons.\n\nI copied others too, sometimes with attribution, like this satire piece about\nJoel Spolsky whose construction was 100% lifted off the first essay of Steve\nAlmond\u2019s Rants, Exploits, and Obsessions (not that you asked). Here I learned\nthat it was really fun, but inventing structures like that is beyond my\nability.\n\nEven now I\u2019m copying! Even now, after I seem to have \u201cfound my voice,\u201d with\n47,000 subscribers in apparent agreement, I\u2019m still experimenting with other\nvoices. Like this very post, which I\u2019m doing in the style of James Altucher,\nexcept without the sexual exploits, and therefore far less entertaining.\n\nSpecifically, like this post of James\u2019s, I started with a personal story, but\nit won\u2019t quite finish until the end where it wraps up with an almost trivial\nconclusion but leaves you with a sense of the larger point. I\u2019m using shorter\nsentences than is my wont. I\u2019m admitting embarrassing or disdainful things\nabout myself, like how I\u2019m insecure and how I have to copy others\u2019 style\nrather than being strong and perceptive enough to develop my own.\n\nNow that you know this is an attempt at style duplication, you can see for\nyourself how much better James is at it than I. But \u201cbeing as good as James at\nJames\u2019 style\u201d is not the goal. The goal is to learn and grow as a writer, and\nthis was fun to do.\n\nThis technique is useful in almost any pursuit. I was the inter-mural\nracquetball champion at the University of Texas, and although it required lots\nof practice, I learned by watching the good players and trying to copy their\nmovements\u2014their swing, where they\u2019d run, where they\u2019d place the ball.\n\nDid any great chef not, at various points in her career, intentionally learn\nvarious styles from various cultures?\n\nEven Picasso\u2014one of the most creative, innovating artists in history\u2014first\nlearned his craft by copying the styles of the Great Masters.\n\nAs a culture, at least in America, we cherish creativity, we reward\nuniqueness. We\u2019re obsessed with \u201cinnovation.\u201d We\u2019re trained that copying is\nevil.\n\nRather, copying is one of the best ways of learning, growing, evaluating, and\nexploring. It\u2019s a valid tool so long as we regard it as a means to an end.\n\nCopying ironically helps you discover yourself: The way to discovering who you\nare, what you value, what you\u2019re good at, what you believe, is to try things\non, like clothes, to see what fits. Bits and pieces of you are already\nreflected in the things around you, so pick up handfuls of other creations and\nsee which bits you want to keep.\n\nEventually the teacher\u2019s pet found some commentary on Eudora Welty in our\ntextbook, saying that Welty encapsulates Southern life and mores. We memorized\nit, in case it was on the test.\n\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear https://longform.asmartbear.com/learn-by-copy/ \u00a9\n2007-2024 Jason Cohen @asmartbear\n\n\u261e If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! \u261c\n\n##### Subscribe for more, and Thank you for sharing!\n\nLearn by Copy\n\n1 of 1\n\n### Thank you for sharing this article:\n\nNo ads.
