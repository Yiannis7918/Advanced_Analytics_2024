Photograph: Terence Kerr/Alamy\n\nInstead of evolution, Buffon used the term \u201cdegeneration\u201d to refer to a\nnatural process \u201coutside the regular reproductive process\u201d that brought about\nchange to a species. The term did not have negative connotations at the time.\n\nBut Buffon never figured out how this species change actually took place: it\ntook Darwin, and his theory of natural selection, to shed light on the\nprocess.\n\nEven without this key insight, Buffon postulated that new species must have\ncome into existence and changed over time, while some species must have gone\nextinct. \u201cThat was a very, very radical idea at the time, and Buffon was\ncensured for it by the Sorbonne: he had to write a statement publicly\nrenouncing everything he had written,\u201d said Roberts. Buffon was later formally\naccused of heresy for implying that Earth was older than the biblical record.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to This is Europe\n\nFree weekly newsletter\n\nThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to\neconomics to the environment\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

But then he would have to add a sentence: \u2018But of course, that\u2019s\nridiculous speculation. The Bible tells us otherwise.\u2019\u201d\n\nSince Buffon had to keep undermining his own observations, it was easy for\nVictorian naturalists to brush aside his contributions, suggesting \u2013 as Darwin\ndid \u2013 that Buffon\u2019s opinions \u201cfluctuated greatly\u201d\n\nRoberts hopes his book will help to reassert Buffon\u2019s rightful place in\nhistory: \u201cThe outrage that greeted Darwin in 1859 is well known,\u201d he said.\n\u201cImagine if those ideas had been asserted in 1759.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Charles Darwin\n  * The Observer\n  * Evolution\n  * Biology\n  * France\n  * Europe\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
