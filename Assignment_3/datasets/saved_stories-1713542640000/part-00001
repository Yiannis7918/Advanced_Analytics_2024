We need to talk.\n\nchaosguru.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nI just love how every single website and application reinvents the wheel when\nit comes to how people log in.\n\nFor instance, Radisson Rewards is now forcing me to reset my password for\n\"Suspicious activity\" on my account. For my security and privacy, you say.\n\nWhat was my old password?\n\ngantlet3SCAM!biology\n\nWhich is weird cause normally my password would be longer than that... OK,\nfine, let's reset it.\n\nGo through the password reset flow, I ask my trusted 1Password to generate a\nnew one. What's the new password?\n\nauburn5spin4greeting_pasteup8COIF\n\nOK, that's more like it. But what's this, password not accepted??\n\nPassword must contain the following: Between 8 - 20 characters\n\nMy new password is rejected for being TOO LONG.\n\nWhat, please, I beg you, do you do with my password that it can't be more than\n20 characters? Do you perhaps store it in plain text, instead of hashed in a\nmodern way? \ud83e\udd26\u2642\ufe0f\n\nAnd since you care so much for my security, do you offer any modern\nauthentication methods? No, of course not. No mention of 2FA, not even by SMS.\nPasskeys? HA!\n\nYOU are the reason YOU had to lock down my account and force me to go through\npassword reset. YOU are storing passwords in plain text and not allowing me to\nfurther secure my account. The passwords they tried on your site for my\naccount didn't come from me, they came from you and other similarly terrible\nwebsites. And the shorter and less secure password I had set before was\nbecause of your restrictions.\n\nHonestly, if you're gonna do such a shitty job at account security I'd rather\nyou just outsource the problem and allow log in with Google and Facebook.\n\nAccount security grade 2/10, and the only reason it's not a 1 is that you seem\nto be doing the bare minimum definition of \"something\" about brute force\nattacks.\n\nShame on you, Radisson Hotels. \ud83d\udca9\n\nThanks for reading The Chaos Guru!
