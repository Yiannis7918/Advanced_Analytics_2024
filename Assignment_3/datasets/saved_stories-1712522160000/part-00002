A tick and\nthree crosses on his clipboard. With his back to Paul, the Doctor watched the\nlatest batch of recruits performing drills on a field outside, while the\nuntethered part of his brain probably imagined a firefight on some unknown\ndistant battlefield. At least not here on Hope.\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t thought anything of it in truth, until now. In light of everything\nwe\u2019ve seen, the company and I: the horrors of the Antelifon, the massacre of\nGossen Hill, the Shine. I\u2019m the last of many. This voice, whoever it is, if I\nlisten, it guides me. They\u2019re the reason I\u2019m still here, Doctor.\u201d Paul took\nanother breath as if meaning to go on but then, held by a momentary wave of\nguilt, let all the air in his lungs out. He should have been getting back to\nhis squad.\n\n\u201cIn a way, I do understand\u201d, the Doctor replied forgivingly. \u201cAnd the Colony\nis extraordinarily grateful for what you\u2019ve done. You\u2019ve been out there a long\ntime.\u201d\n\nSitting upright in his bed, Paul tried to imagine a version of himself that\nhadn\u2019t experienced everything he had, all the purpose and pain; a person who\u2019d\nhad more respect for his father\u2019s cautionary advice back home; a person who\u2019d\nsought a clean, comfortable life working the fields, without other people\u2019s\npolitics and wars. No matter how hard he tried, that person didn\u2019t resemble\nhim as he was now or anything he\u2019d ever wanted. The call to fight had pulled\nhim across the galaxy like a backwash pulls a person out to sea. It had been\nhelpless to struggle.\n\nPaul couldn\u2019t recall an exact moment he\u2019d started hearing the voice. More like\na series of moments when he realised its utterances weren\u2019t being said by\npeople or machines. It grew from whispers, into vaguely discernible sounds.\nHuman sounds, pervading dreams. Then fully-formed words.\n\nOn base, while waiting for orders and time moved perceptibly slower, Paul\nwould wake suddenly from deep sleep to the snores of his bunkmates or the\noccasional radio broadcast from Hope, playing some old-timey music from the\nend of the last century. He\u2019d walk the corridors at night so he could shake\noff some excess energy then wake the next morning, his head on his pillow,\nwondering if any of it had really happened.\n\n\u201cStick to your drills. Keep the squad ready. The rest will follow\u201d, was the\nadvice of his commanding officer.\n\nBut no word came for days or weeks; it didn\u2019t matter. Then Paul and his squad\nwere thrust into combat. Fighting who? The jungle was his greatest enemy, left\nuntouched for millenia and now showered with bullets, lasers piercing the sky,\nsplintering wood. Something unnatural. But always giving way to silence.\n\nThe guerrillas had retreated further in they would say, where our tanks\ncouldn\u2019t go. Back to base. Back to sleep.\n\nAfter one such skirmish, a preacher swept the still smouldering battlefield,\ntaking a knee beside each of the slain to say a short prayer. Stopping to\ncatch his breath and drink the last of his canteen, Paul could hear the man\nmuttering behind him. Not individual words, only the \u201cs\u201d sounds, like\nwhispers.\n\n\u201cYou are loved, Paul\u201d, the man asserted from his kneeled position only a few\nfeet away.\n\n\u201cThank you\u201d, Paul replied hesitantly. They\u2019d never spoken before, so Paul was\nsurprised the preacher even knew his name. He thought he\u2019d made his position\nclear to others: he had no respect for the devoted. How could anyone in their\nright mind believe there was a physical being watching over their every move,\nevery decision? Among all the galaxy\u2019s troubles, this conflict. There were\njust two sides. Paul was certain of it.\n\nHe stood and turned to face the preacher but there was nobody there. The\nbattlefield, the dead, all still intact. Dropships ready to collect those that\nhad survived. But no preacher.\n\nA few steps away lay the body of a comrade, someone Paul hadn\u2019t known well but\ntrained with at an earlier time. Sadly, he couldn\u2019t remember the man\u2019s name.\nWith the corpse\u2019s head turned away Paul unashamedly reached into its pocket,\nfinding a New Testament there. Entire civilisations had been scorched, but\nsomehow, unrelenting, religion found a way. And so would he, Paul thought,\ntossing the book to the ground.\n\nWhy was his voice any of the Army\u2019s concern? Why he\u2019d felt the need to tell\none of his squadmates, Paul still wondered. It had been an unnecessary\novershare. A person devoid of sleep will do questionable things.\n\nIn some ways he felt lucky to have been chosen. \u201cNo\u201d, he almost muttered to\nhimself, he was never chosen. How could he know the voice wasn\u2019t him? A\npartition in his brain. In tones and accents he\u2019d heard before but not the\nvoice of anyone he personally knew, it would tell him how to navigate the\nbattlefield to avoid being shot, who to shoot, and sometimes who to speak to\nand which frequency to call on. But Paul knew this wasn\u2019t just another part of\nhis brain telling him things he already knew; it was another person entirely;\nhis own Guardian Angel, looking out for him. He appreciated the irony.\n\nThe Doctor placed a probe in Paul\u2019s left ear and music started to play,\ninitially only faintly and then becoming louder. This lasted a few minutes.\n\u201cFunctionally, your hearing works exactly as it\u2019s supposed to. Our scans\nhaven\u2019t revealed anything out of the ordinary\u201d, said the Doctor reassuringly.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be able to return to the field, Paul, but only after you rest. I\u2019m\nrecommending you stay off-world, at least for a month or two\u201d.\n\nPaul felt disappointed to not be returning to his squad soon, but relieved to\nknow there wasn\u2019t anything fundamentally wrong with him. What had been the\npoint of all of this? The urgency with which the Army had removed him from his\npost had surprised him, initially labelling him \u201cinsane\u201d but then privately\nretracting what it had said. There hadn\u2019t been any apparent danger. He hadn\u2019t\nrepresented a threat to others, or to order. Or had he? While his comrades\nfell, Paul continued to survive impregnable odds, not by any of his own\nstrengths or merits but by, as he had described to the Doctor, a voice. He\ncould challenge Death. Where had the voice come from if not from Paul himself?\n\nMore\n\n", "frontpage": false}
