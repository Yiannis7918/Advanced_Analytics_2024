While it isn't entirely unexpected for\nthese types of customization apps to break with major updates, Microsoft has\nactually explicitly blocked some apps, citing stability and security issues\u2014an\nassertion that a third-party app maker has disputed.\n\nThe upcoming Windows 11 version is a highly anticipated update that is\nexpected to be released in a few months. It will have many interesting and\nuseful features, but there may be a tradeoff as Microsoft created low-effort\nblocks (at least for now) for customization apps.\n\n> See normal job vs botched pic.twitter.com/dS0sTzy0KsApril 6, 2024\n\nSee more\n\nStartAllBack and ExplorerPatcher provide interface customization options for\nWindows 11, allowing users to switch to the familiar Windows 10 interface.\nStartAllBack, one of the well-known customization apps, showed that its\nexecutable file name is hard-blocked, indicating that Microsoft is taking\nsteps against specific apps. When you try installing these apps, Windows 11\ntriggers a notice that it will not allow the installation as it causes\nsecurity or performance issues. But there is an easy workaround\u2014you can simply\nrename the exe file.\n\nIrrespective of how easy it can be to circumvent, creating these types of\nrestrictions, especially when the 'offending' app apparently doesn't create\nsecurity or stability issues, always leaves a bad aftertaste. Microsoft may\nalso resort to a more aggressive block in future releases. At the time of\nwriting, Windows 11 version 23H2 has no problems with StartAllBack or\nExplorerPatch installation.\n\nMicrosoft encourages users to switch to Windows 11, but many are hesitant due\nto UI changes and the mandatory Microsoft account integration (which also has\na workaround). The software giant could have addressed these issues (some if\nnot all) by providing options to switch to a Windows 10-style interface,\nreducing the need to rely on third-party apps (assuming legitimate security or\nstability concerns exist).\n\nMicrosoft may remove the blocks once Windows 11 24H2 releases, but we'll have\nto wait and watch how this unfolds in the near future. Many users rely on\ncertain customization options to have an older interface or make it\nlightweight via apps such as Tiny11.\n\n## Stay on the Cutting Edge\n\nJoin the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC\ntech news \u2014 and have for over 25 years.

These blocks are only for those versions,\nafter all. From the tweet: \"Fixing the bugs and revving the version number is\nlikely all that's needed here (this time).\"\n\nReply\n\n  * ezst036\n\nMicrosoft: If you want to stay on Windows then what you need to do is pipe\ndown, shut up, and do things the Microsoft way.\n\nI think its quite obvious that Microsoft does not care, they were even brazen\nenough to give instructions on how to install Linux only a few months ago. If\nyou really want a customizable GUI, you only have one choice. Things like this\nare the reason why Linux went from 3% to 4% market share in less than a year.\n\nReply\n\n  * coromonadalix\n\nyeah right Microsoft IS an unreliable high crash rate software that is\nextremely sensitive to Microsoft updates I had this week an fresh win 11, and\nsuddenly crashed, due to their KBxxxx quality updates, had to remove them TO\nBE ABLE TO WORK\n\nStartallisback combined with explorer patcher on my personal pc is the sole\nreason i can work with this piece of #%@$ of windows, they destroyed what was\ngood in W10 ............\n\nSo sick and tired of Msoft, but alas need an windows platform if React OS was\ndevelopped enough i would say f u microsoft, for ever\n\nReply\n\n  * waltc3\n\nThis has not been my experience with Startallback and all the beta-channel\nupdates through the most recent build, 22635.3430. The couple of times that\nStarttallback has caused a problem with a beta-channel Win11 build, the\ndeveloper has responded immediately with an update that solves the problem--\nsometimes on the same day. StartallBack even updates through the standard\nWin11 update system. Startallback deals with the problem of the Win11 taskbar\nbeing nowhere near as customizable as it has been in previous versions of\nWindows, so when Microsoft changes the code relative to some taskbar\nfunctionality, it may cause a problem with the current version of SAB, but as\nI say it will be remedied immediately by the SAB developer. Current version of\nSAB is 3.7.8. I've got software costing far more than the $4.99 cost of SAB\nthat isn't updated nearly as often as SAB...;) It's made Win11 far more fun to\nuse than that butt-ugly bottom-feeding taskbar that is immovable. Ugh.\n\nReply\n\n  * coromonadalix\n\nyep same here the developpers degugged pretty fast\n\nand i was glad to pay a mere 5-6 $ CAD to have something good and working\n\nthe 2 ones who work are starallisback and start 11, but not free\n\nopenshell mmmm never really tried it back, was messy in the past\n\nReply\n\n  * Alvar \"Miles\" Udell\n\nArticle title should be: \"Microsoft disables third party UI tools for\nstability\". I use ExplorerPatcher and it can have issues, just right clicking\non Start and choosing an option can cause it to crash and Windows Powershell\n(Administrator) doesn't work, among other things, so considering the supposed\nmajor update of 24H2 it seems prudent to disable them. Bit of a dick move to\njust outright disable them without a warning prompt first, but it's far from\n\"stifling\" third party UI programs, since those programs still work.\n\nReply\n\n  * MacZ24\n\nPeople are hesitating to switch to Windows 11 because it is an inferior\nsystem.\n\nJust like the Windows store, MS tries to remove options and freedom from its\nusers to benefit ITSELF.\n\nLike in a lot of industries, the lack of meaningful innovations has led to\ncorporations turning on their users for growth.\n\nCall it mission creep, feature creep or inflation : it essentially forces\nusers to buy stuff they don't want or need (for 90% of them) because it is\n'new'. And if it involves a recurring payment, it is even better.\n\nBut at the end of the day, it is, for most people, paying more for no more\nusefulness : it's pure inflation.\n\nReply\n\n##### Most Popular\n\nMSI rolls out a new high-end Nvidia gaming GPU in China \u2014 GeForce RTX 4090D\n24G Ventus 3X comes as a more affordable option\n\nBy Aaron KlotzApril 06, 2024\n\nRaspberry Pi powers a five-foot magic mirror that doubles as a retro gaming\nconsole\n\nBy Ash HillApril 06, 2024\n\nAMD may have a new platform for upcoming Ryzen CPUs \u2014 AM5+ socket and Granite\nRidge CPUs listed in a microcode extraction tool\n\nBy Anton ShilovApril 06, 2024\n\nLaptop BIOS password reset technique uses contorted paperclips stuffed into a\nparallel port\n\nBy Mark TysonApril 06, 2024\n\nSteam download causes M2 MacBook Pro SSD to became so full that data couldn't\nbe deleted \u2014 user had to wipe SSD to make system functional again\n\nBy Mark TysonApril 06, 2024\n\nAMD announces open-sourcing of its GPU software stack and documentation,\nincluding MES\n\nBy Christopher HarperApril 06, 2024\n\nSamsung to double investment in Texas fab, spend $44 billion to build leading-\nedge chips: Report\n\nBy Anton ShilovApril 06, 2024\n\nKioxia aims to mass produce 1000-layer 3D NAND by 2031 \u2014 quadruple the current\nnumber of layers\n\nBy Anton ShilovApril 05, 2024\n\nIntel confirms new round of layoffs in its Sales and Marketing Group\n\nBy Roshan Ashraf ShaikhApril 05, 2024\n\nAMD claims LLMs run up to 79% faster on Ryzen 8040 CPUs compared to Intel\u2019s\nnewest Core Ultra chips\n\nBy Aaron KlotzApril 05, 2024\n\nAMD's latest China-exclusive CPUs benchmarked \u2014 Ryzen 7 8700F and Ryzen 5\n8400F aren't much slower than costlier models\n\nBy Zhiye LiuApril 05, 2024\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and\nleading digital publisher.
