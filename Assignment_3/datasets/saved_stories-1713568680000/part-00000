The photon,\nthe quantum of light, has an infinite lifetime. Or does it?\n\nBy firing a pulse of light at a semi-transparent/semi-reflective thin medium,\nresearchers can measure the time it must take for these photons to tunnel\nthrough the barrier to the other side. Although the step of tunneling itself\nmay be instantaneous, the traveling particles are still limited by the speed\nof light. By taking high-speed images of this light pulse, we can construct a\nmovie that appears continuous.\n\nCredit: J. Liang, L. Zhu & L.V. Wang, 2018, Light: Science & Applications\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n  * In the expanding Universe, for billions upon billions of years, the photon seems to be one of the very few particles that has an apparently infinite lifetime.\n  * Photons are the quanta that compose light, and in the absence of any other interactions that force them to change their properties, are eternally stable, with no hint that they would transmute into any other particle.\n  * But how well do we know this to be true, and what evidence can we point to in order to determine their stability? It's a fascinating question that pushes us right to the limits of what we can scientifically observe and measure.\n\nEthan Siegel\n\nShare Does light itself truly have an infinite lifetime? on Facebook\n\nShare Does light itself truly have an infinite lifetime? on Twitter (X)\n\nShare Does light itself truly have an infinite lifetime? on LinkedIn\n\nOne of the most enduring ideas in all the Universe is that everything that\nexists now will someday see its existence come to an end. The stars, galaxies,\nand even the black holes that occupy the space in our Universe will all some\nday burn out, fade away, and otherwise decay, leaving what we think of as a\n\u201cheat death\u201d state: where no more energy can possibly be extracted, in any\nway, from a uniform, maximum entropy, equilibrium state. But, perhaps, there\nare exceptions to this general rule, and that some things will truly live on\nforever.\n\nOne such candidate for a truly stable entity is the photon: the quantum of\nlight. All of the electromagnetic radiation that exists in the Universe is\nmade up of photons, and photons, as far as we can tell, have an infinite\nlifetime. Does that mean that light will truly live forever? That\u2019s what Anna-\nMaria Galante wants to know, writing in to ask:\n\n\u201cDo photons live forever? Or do they \u2018die,\u2019 and convert to some other\nparticle? The light we see erupting from cosmic events over a verrrrry long\npast ... we seem to know where it comes from, but where does it go? What is\nthe life cycle of a photon?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a big and compelling question, and one that brings us right up to the\nedge of everything we know about the Universe. Here\u2019s the best answer that\nscience has today.\n\nAs was first noted by Vesto Slipher back in the 1910s, some of the objects we\nobserve show the spectral signatures of absorption or emission of particular\natoms, ions, or molecules, but with a systematic shift toward either the red\nor blue end of the light spectrum. When combined with distance measurements\nfor those objects, this data gave rise to the initial idea of the expanding\nUniverse: the farther away a galaxy is, the greater its light will appear\nredshifted to our eyes and instruments.\n\nCredit: Vesto Slipher, 1917, Proc. Amer. Phil. Soc.\n\nThe first time the question of a photon having a finite lifetime came up, it\nwas for a very good reason: we had just discovered the key evidence for the\nexpanding Universe. The spiral and elliptical nebulae in the sky were shown to\nbe galaxies, or \u201cisland Universes\u201d as they were then known, well beyond the\nscale and scope of the Milky Way. These collections of millions, billions, or\neven trillions of stars were located at least millions of light-years away,\nplacing them well outside of the Milky Way. Moreover, it was quickly shown\nthat these distant objects weren\u2019t just far away, but they appeared to be\nreceding from us, as the more distant they were, on average, the greater the\nlight from them turned out to be systematically shifted toward redder and\nredder wavelengths.\n\nOf course, by the time this data was widely available in the 1920s and 1930s,\nwe had already learned about the quantum nature of light, which taught us that\nthe wavelength of light determined its energy. We also had both special and\ngeneral relativity well in hand, which taught us that once the light leaves\nits source, the only way you could change its frequency was to either:\n\n  1. have it interact with some form of matter and/or energy,\n  2. have the observer moving either toward or away from the observer,\n  3. or to have the curvature properties of space itself change, such as due to a gravitational redshift/blueshift or an expansion/contraction of the Universe.\n\nThe first potential explanation, in particular, led to the formulation of a\nfascinating alternative cosmology: tired light cosmology.\n\nLight may be emitted at a particular wavelength, but the expansion of the\nUniverse will stretch it as it travels. Light emitted in the ultraviolet will\nbe shifted all the way into the infrared when considering a galaxy whose light\narrives from 13+ billion years ago. The more the expansion of the Universe\naccelerates, the greater the light from distant objects will be redshifted and\nthe fainter it will appear.\n\nCredit: Larry McNish/RASC Calgary\n\nFirst formulated in 1929 by Fritz Zwicky \u2014 yes, the same Fritz Zwicky who\ncoined the term supernova, who first formulated the dark matter hypothesis,\nand who once tried to \u201cstill\u201d the turbulent atmospheric air by firing a rifle\nthrough his telescope tube \u2014 the tired light hypothesis put forth the notion\nthat propagating light loses energy through collisions with other particles\npresent in the space between galaxies. The more space there was to propagate\nthrough, the logic went, the more energy would be lost to these interactions,\nand that would be the explanation, rather than peculiar velocities or cosmic\nexpansion, for why light appeared to be more severely redshifted for more\ndistant objects.\n\nHowever, in order for this scenario to be correct, there are two predictions\nthat should be true.\n\n1\\. ) When light travels through a medium, even a sparse medium, it slows down\nfrom the speed of light in vacuum to the speed of light in that medium. The\nslowdown affects light of different frequencies by different amounts. Just as\nlight passing through a prism splits into different colors, light passing\nthrough an intergalactic medium that interacted with it should slow light of\ndifferent wavelengths down by different amounts. When that light re-enters a\ntrue vacuum, it will resume moving at the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\nThrough the vacuum of space, all light, regardless of wavelength or energy,\ntravels at the same speed: the speed of light in a vacuum. When we observe\nlight from a distant star, we are observing light that has already completed\nthat journey from the source to the observer.\n\nCredit: Lucas Vieira/Wikimedia Commons\n\nAnd yet, when we observed the light coming from sources at different\ndistances, we found no wavelength-dependence to the amount of redshift that\nlight exhibited. Instead, at all distances, all wavelengths of emitted light\nare observed to redshift by the exact same factor as all others; there is no\nwavelength-dependence to the redshift. Because of this null observation, the\nfirst prediction of tired light cosmology is falsified.\n\nBut there\u2019s a second prediction to contend with, as well.\n\n2.) If more distant light loses more energy by passing through a greater\nlength of a \u201clossy medium\u201d than less distant light, then those more distant\nobjects should appear to be blurred by a progressively greater and greater\namount than the less distant ones.\n\nAnd again, when we go to test this prediction, we find that it isn\u2019t borne out\nby observations at all. More distant galaxies, when seen alongside less\ndistant galaxies, appear just as sharp and high-resolution as the less distant\nones. This is true, for example, for all five of the galaxies in Stephan\u2019s\nQuintet, as well as for the background galaxies visible behind all five of the\nquintet\u2019s members. This prediction is falsified as well.\n\nThe main galaxies of Stephan\u2019s Quintet, as revealed by JWST on July 12, 2022.\nThe galaxy on the left is only about ~15% as distant as the other galaxies,\nand the background galaxies are many scores of times farther away. And yet,\nthey\u2019re all equally sharp to JWST\u2019s eyes, demonstrating that the Universe is\nfull of stars and galaxies practically everywhere we look.\n\nCredit: NASA, ESA, CSA, and STScI\n\nWhile these observations are good enough to falsify the tired light hypothesis\n\u2014 and, in fact, were good enough to falsify it immediately, as soon as it was\nproposed \u2014 that\u2019s only one possible way that light could be unstable. Light\ncould either die out or convert into some other particle, and there\u2019s a set of\ninteresting ways to think about these possibilities.\n\nThe first arises simply from the fact that we have a cosmological redshift.\nEach and every photon that\u2019s produced, irrespective of how it\u2019s produced,\nwhether thermally or from a quantum transition or from any other interaction,\nwill stream through the Universe until it collides and interacts with another\nquantum of energy. But if you were a photon emitted from a quantum transition,\nunless you can engage in the inverse quantum reaction in rather rapid fashion,\nyou\u2019re going to begin traveling through intergalactic space, with your\nwavelength stretching due to the Universe\u2019s expansion as you do. If you\u2019re not\nlucky enough to be absorbed by a quantum bound state with the right allowable\ntransition frequency, you\u2019ll simply redshift and redshift until you\u2019re below\nthe longest possible wavelength that will ever allow you to be absorbed by\nsuch a transition ever again.\n\nThis synthesis of three different sets of spectral lines from a mercury vapor\nlamp shows the impact that a magnetic field can have. In (A), there is no\nmagnetic field. In (B) and (C), there is a magnetic field, but they\u2019re\noriented differently, explaining the differential splitting of the spectral\nlines. Many atoms exhibit this fine-structure or even hyperfine-structure\nwithout the application of an external field, and those transitions are\nessential when it comes to constructing a functional atomic clock. Many\ntransitions, such as the ones shown here, are discrete, rather than continuous\nprocesses.\n\nCredit: Warren Leywon/Wikimedia Commons\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a second set of possibilities that exists for all photons:\nthey can interact with an otherwise free quantum particle, producing one of\nany number of effects.\n\nThis can include scattering, where a charged particle \u2014 usually an electron \u2014\nabsorbs and then re-emits a photon. This involves an exchange of both energy\nand momentum, and can boost either the charged particle or the photon to\nhigher energies, at the expense of leaving the other one with less energy.\n\nAt high enough energies, the collision of a photon with another particle \u2014\neven another photon, if the energy is high enough \u2014 can spontaneously produce\na particle-antiparticle pair if there\u2019s enough available energy to make them\nboth through Einstein\u2019s E = mc2. In fact, the highest energy cosmic rays of\nall can do this even with the remarkably low-energy photons that are a part of\nthe cosmic microwave background: the Big Bang\u2019s leftover glow. For cosmic rays\nabove ~10^17 eV in energy, a single, typical CMB photon has a chance to\nproduce electron-positron pairs. At even higher energies, more like ~10^20 eV\nin energy, a CMB photon has a significantly large chance to convert to a\nneutral pion, which robs cosmic rays of energy rather quickly. This is the\nprimary reason why there\u2019s a steep drop-off in the population of the highest-\nenergy cosmic rays: they\u2019re above this critical energy threshold.\n\nThe energy spectrum of the highest energy cosmic rays, by the collaborations\nthat detected them. The results are all incredibly highly consistent from\nexperiment to experiment, and reveal a significant drop-off at the GZK\nthreshold of ~5 x 10^19 eV. Still, many such cosmic rays exceed this energy\nthreshold, indicating a flaw in the most simplified picture of these cosmic\nrays.\n\nCredit: M. Tanabashi et al. (Particle Data Group), Phys. Rev. D, 2019\n\nIn other words, even very low-energy photons can be converted into other\nparticles \u2014 non-photons \u2014 by colliding with another high-enough-energy\nparticle.\n\nThere\u2019s yet a third way to alter a photon beyond cosmic expansion or through\nconverting into particles with a non-zero rest mass: by scattering off of a\nparticle that results in the production of still additional photons. In\npractically every electromagnetic interaction, or interaction between a\ncharged particle and at least one photon, there are what are known as\n\u201cradiative corrections\u201d that arise in quantum field theories. For every\nstandard interaction where the same number of photons exist at the beginning\nas at the end, there\u2019s a little less than a 1% chance \u2014 more like 1/137, to be\nspecific \u2014 that you\u2019ll wind up radiating an additional photon in the end over\nthe number you started off with.\n\nAnd every time you have an energetic particle that possesses a positive rest\nmass and a positive temperature, those particles will also radiate photons\naway: losing energy in the form of photons.\n\nPhotons are very, very easy to create, and while it\u2019s possible to absorb them\nby inducing the proper quantum transitions, most excitations will de-excite\nafter a given amount of time. Just like the old saying that \u201cWhat goes up must\ncome down,\u201d quantum systems that get excited to higher energies through the\nabsorption of photons will eventually de-excite as well, producing at least\nthe same number of photons, generally with the same net energy, as were\nabsorbed in the first place.\n\nWhen a hydrogen atom forms, it has equal probability of having the electron\u2019s\nand proton\u2019s spins be aligned and anti-aligned. If they\u2019re anti-aligned, no\nfurther transitions will occur, but if they\u2019re aligned, they can quantum\ntunnel into that lower energy state, emitting a photon of a very specific\nwavelength (21 cm) on very specific, and rather long, timescales. The\nprecision of this transition has been measured to better than 1-part-in-a-\ntrillion, and has not varied over the many decades it\u2019s been known. It is the\nfirst light emitted in the Universe after the formation of neutral atoms: even\nbefore the formation of the first stars, but also thereafter: whenever new\nstars are formed, ultraviolet emission ionizes hydrogen atoms, creating this\nsignature once again when those atoms spontaneously re-form.\n\nCredit: Tiltec/Wikimedia Commons\n\nGiven that there are so many ways to create photons, you\u2019re probably\nsalivating for ways to destroy them. After all, simply waiting for the effects\nof cosmic redshift to bring them down to an asymptotically low energy value\nand density is going to take an arbitrarily long time. Each time the Universe\nstretches to become larger by a factor of 2, the total energy density in the\nform of photons drops by a factor of 16: a factor of 2^4. A factor of 8 comes\nbecause the number of photons \u2014 despite all the ways there are to create them\n\u2014 remains relatively fixed, and doubling the distance between objects\nincreases the volume of the observable Universe by a factor of 8: double the\nlength, double the width, and double the depth.\n\nThe fourth-and-final factor of two comes from the cosmological expansion,\nwhich stretches the wavelength to double its original wavelength, thereby\nhalving the energy-per-photon. On long enough timescales, this will cause the\nenergy density of the Universe in the form of photons to asymptotically drop\ntoward zero, but it will never quite reach it.\n\nWhile matter (both normal and dark) and radiation become less dense as the\nUniverse expands owing to its increasing volume, dark energy, and also the\nfield energy during inflation, is a form of energy inherent to space itself.\nAs new space gets created in the expanding Universe, the dark energy density\nremains constant.\n\nCredit: E. Siegel/Beyond the Galaxy\n\nYou might try to get clever, and imagine some sort of exotic, ultra-low-mass\nparticle that couples to photons, that a photon could convert into under the\nright conditions. Some sort of boson or pseudoscalar particle \u2014 like an axion\nor axino, a neutrino condensate, or some sort of exotic Cooper pair \u2014 could\nlead to precisely this sort of occurrence, but again, this only works if the\nphoton is sufficiently high in energy to convert to the particle with a non-\nzero rest mass via E = mc2. Once the photon\u2019s energy redshifts below a\ncritical threshold, that no longer works.\n\nSimilarly, you might imagine the ultimate way to absorb photons: by having\nthem encounter a black hole. Once anything crosses over from outside the event\nhorizon to inside it, it not only can never escape, but it will always add to\nthe rest mass energy of the black hole itself. Yes, there will be many black\nholes populating the Universe over time, and they will grow in mass and size\nas time continues forward.\n\nBut even that will only occur up to a point. Once the density of the Universe\ndrops below a certain threshold, black holes will begin decaying via Hawking\nradiation faster than they grow, and that means the production of even greater\nnumbers of photons than went into the black hole in the first place. Over the\nnext ~10^100 years or so, every black hole in the Universe will eventually\ndecay away completely, with the overwhelming majority of the decay products\nbeing photons.\n\nIn the far future, there will be no more matter around black holes, but\ninstead their emitted energy will be dominated by Hawking radiation, which\nwill cause the size of the event horizon to shrink. The transition from\n\u201cgrowing\u201d to \u201cdecaying\u201d black holes will occur whenever the accretion rate\ndrops below the mass loss rate due to Hawking radiation, an event estimated to\noccur some ~10^20 years in the future. How the information that went into\nmaking the black hole gets encoded into the outgoing radiation, or whether\nthat\u2019s even the case, has not yet been determined.\n\nCredit: The EU\u2019s Communicate Science\n\nSo will they ever die out? Not according to the currently understood laws of\nphysics. In fact, the situation is even more dire than you probably realize.\nYou can think of every photon that was or will be:\n\n  * created in the Big Bang,\n  * created from quantum transitions,\n  * created from radiative corrections,\n  * created through the emission of energy,\n  * or created via black hole decay,\n\nand even if you wait for all of those photons to reach arbitrarily low\nenergies due to the Universe\u2019s expansion, the Universe still won\u2019t be devoid\nof photons.\n\nWhy\u2019s that?\n\nBecause the Universe still has dark energy in it. Just as an object with an\nevent horizon, like a black hole, will continuously emit photons due to the\ndifference in acceleration close to versus far away from the event horizon, so\ntoo will an object with a cosmological (or, more technically, a Rindler)\nhorizon. Einstein\u2019s equivalence principle tells us that observers cannot tell\nthe difference between gravitational acceleration or acceleration due to any\nother cause, and any two unbound locations will appear to accelerate relative\nto one another owing to the presence of dark energy. The physics that results\nis identical: a continuous amount of thermal radiation gets emitted. Based on\nthe value of the cosmological constant we infer today, that means a blackbody\nspectrum of radiation with a temperature of ~10^\u201330 K will always permeate all\nof space, no matter how far into the future we go.\n\nFrom outside a black hole, all the infalling matter will emit light and is\nalways visible, while nothing from behind the event horizon can get out. But\nif you were the one who fell into a black hole, your energy could conceivably\nre-emerge as part of a hot Big Bang in a newborn Universe.\n\nCredit: Andrew Hamilton, JILA, University of Colorado\n\nEven at its very end, no matter how far into the future we go, the Universe\nwill always continue to produce radiation, ensuring that it will never reach\nabsolute zero, that it will always contain photons, and that even at the\nlowest energies it will ever reach, there ought to be nothing else for the\nphoton to decay or transition into. Although the energy density of the\nUniverse will continue to drop as the Universe expands, and the energy\ninherent to any individual photon will continue to drop as time ticks onward\nand onward into the future, there will never be anything \u201cmore fundamental\u201d\nthat they transition into.\n\nTravel the Universe with astrophysicist Ethan Siegel. Subscribers will get the\nnewsletter every Saturday. All aboard!\n\nThere are exotic scenarios we can cook up that will change the story, of\ncourse. Perhaps it\u2019s possible that photons really do have a non-zero rest\nmass, causing them to slow down to slower than the speed of light when enough\ntime passes. Perhaps photons really are inherently unstable, and there\u2019s\nsomething else that\u2019s truly massless, like a combination of gravitons, that\nthey can decay into. And perhaps there\u2019s some sort of phase transition that\nwill occur, far into the future, where the photon will reveal its true\ninstability and will decay into a yet-unknown quantum state.\n\nBut if all we have is the photon as we understand it in the Standard Model,\nthen the photon is truly stable. A Universe filled with dark energy ensures,\neven as the photons that exist today redshift to arbitrarily low energies,\nthat new ones will always get created, leading to a Universe with a finite and\npositive photon number and photon energy density at all times. We can only be\ncertain of the rules to the extent that we\u2019ve measured them, but unless\nthere\u2019s a big piece of the puzzle missing that we simply haven\u2019t uncovered\nyet, we can count on the fact that photons might fade away, but they\u2019ll never\ntruly die.\n\nEthan is on medical leave until May 6th.
