As\nproof, they published dozens of these confidential documents on the dark web.\nRTL said it verified those documents.\n\nBram Nauta, a professor of chip design at the University of Twente, thinks the\nstolen data can be a big problem for the chip maker. \u201cNexperia\u2019s knowledge is\nnot necessarily in the chips because they are relatively simple, but in the\nproduction process of these parts. The machines used to make these chips are\nextremely secret, you don\u2019t want those secrets on the streets.\u201d\n\nNexperia, which was acquired by the Chinese company Wingtech Technology in\n2019, focuses on simpler chips for everyday products. It produces over 100\nbillion of these chips, used worldwide in everything from smartphones to\nrefrigerators and vacuums, every year. Last year, Nieuwsuur reported that\nNexperia chips were also found in Russian military drones and missiles.\n\n## Follow us:\n\n## Latest stories\n\n  * Former secret church in Amsterdam's Red Light District added to EU heritage list\n\n  * Nijmegen chipmaker hit by ransomware attack; Hackers threatening to leak trade secrets\n\n  * Netherlands losing direct train to Switzerland; Last Amsterdam-Basel train on July 15\n\n  * Teacher at Veenendaal Islamic Center preaching hatred toward non-Muslims: report\n\n  * No noise standards for Leeuwarden airbase, Defense says after years of F-35 complaints\n\n  * Prosecutors drop case against nurse suspected of murdering dozens of Covid patients\n\n## Top stories\n\n  * Prosecutors drop case against nurse suspected of murdering dozens of Covid patients\n\n  * Dutch tourists killed in Austria avalance were 33, 35, & 60; Two from Apeldoorn\n\n  * Municipalities extra alert to disruptions to WWII commemorations on Remembrance Day\n\n  * Third Dutch tourist dies from injuries during Austria avalanche; Fourth hospitalized\n\n  * Father of abducted Amsterdam girl facing 9 years in prison for taking her to India\n\n  * Avalanche kills two Dutch people in Austrian Alps; Two others rescued, 13 unharmed\n\n\u00a9 2012-2024, NL Times, All rights reserved.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
