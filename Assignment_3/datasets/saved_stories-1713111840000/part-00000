And I think that\u2019s one thing that we\u2019ve all lost. And\nit\u2019s led, I fear... I don\u2019t want to get too into anything, current events,\nbut... to an extraordinary, extraordinary dropping away of basic morality,\nlike a basic \u2018This is wrong. This should not happen\u2019. I just think that what\u2019s\nhappened is the lack of respect for women in general has degraded especially\nthe left, has degraded their sense of what is right and wrong.\n\nThere is obviously a deal of enigmatic content swirling through this answer\nand Linehan seemed to be struggling a little both to marshal his line of\nthought and contain his emotions. \u201cCurrent events\u201d is, I think, a reference to\nthe Hamas attack on Israel and, in particular, the rapes committed by the\nattackers. (The interview took place in mid-October.) Linehan\u2019s comment about\nfeeling embarrassed about what has happened to the Catholic Church probably\nstems from a feeling that too much has been made of Father Ted as some kind of\nsurreal, comedic battering ram, that was bravely carried in the cause of\nsocial change in Ireland: \u201cI don\u2019t want give myself too much credit there,\u201d he\nhas said elsewhere. \u201cIt was kind of safe. Catholic priests don\u2019t try and\ndestroy your career.\u201d\n\nBut his answer also contains a fairly clear and plaintive expression of loss.\nThe demise of Mass attendance in Ireland has come at the expense of much\neveryday solidarity and togetherness.Indeed, Linehan returned to this theme in\nanother interview a few weeks later. Talking about Father Ted: The Musical\n(which remains unperformed), he said: \u201cI wrote it thinking it will be a bit\nlike being in a lovely Mass. Even though I\u2019m an atheist, I do feel a bit of a\nloss of the fact that we don\u2019t have a weekly event where we all go and shake\nhands with our neighbours, you know.\u201d\n\nA comment on an Irish website, also from last year, vividly fills out further\nthis picture of what has gone:\n\nWhen I was a child, and even though I only appreciate it now, Sunday mass was\na wonderful weekly Community Fire Drill: Is everyone at mass, who\u2019s missing\nand why, who\u2019s expecting, who\u2019s sick, what\u2019s the trouble, what\u2019s new, who\u2019s\n\u201cailing\u201d or \u201cdamn bad looking\u201d, who\u2019s \u201cflying again\u201d, who\u2019s \u201cgrowing up grand\nand strong\u201d, etc\n\nIn effect, this commenter and Linehan appear to be pointing out an unfilled\ncrater that has appeared in Irish life following the fall of Catholicism. They\nare not the only ones to do so and the exodus from Mass is not the only change\nthat is preoccupying people.\n\nAccording to psychotherapist Stella O\u2019Malley, the loss of ritualistic\ngestures, with all of the weight of meaning and consolation they carried, as\nwell as the simpler comforts of the familiar, provides another: \u201cWhen you look\nat some of the anxiety that\u2019s manifesting, you really start thinking about the\npost-religious age,\u201d she said last year in an interview given not long after\nLinehan\u2019s. \u201cOCD is a very good example.\u201d O\u2019Malley pointed out the reliance on\nrepetitive, symmetrical gestures among those with OCD and drew parallels with\nwhat religion used to provide through actions such as blessing yourself or\npraying the Rosary. According to O\u2019Malley, for anxious people, \u201cwho were\ninclined towards looking for a framework, the feeling that \u2018God\u2019s in his\nheaven, and if I do, you know, seven decades of the Rosary, I\u2019ll be ok\u2019\u201d was a\ntremendous calming resource to fall back on. And all of those people, she\ncontinued, \u201chave been plugged out of that framework\u201d. For centuries, there was\na repertoire of gestures that soothed the vulnerable, but, in abandoning\nreligion, \u201cwe took it away from them and they have nothing. Where are they\ngoing? They\u2019re going into anxiety and OCD.\u201d\n\nThe Irish writer John Waters once made an adjacent point: \u201cPreviously, God\nacted as a kind of buffer between the human being and absolute responsibility\nto be in control of every aspect of his or her own life. Problems could be\noffered up, handed over or placed for mediation with the Blessed Virgin or\nSaint Anthony. Now, unless I am able to guarantee my own and my family\u2019s\nsafety, security, comfort and happiness, the responsibility rests on my\nshoulders alone.\u201d Prayer and prayerful habits, Waters and O\u2019Malley seem to be\nsuggesting, formed an essential part of the social and psychological machinery\nthat Ireland ran on. But they have been stripped out \u2014 and the replacement\nparts are not working.\n\nFor the country as a whole, however, the collapse of Catholicism seems to\nremain either a more or less unalloyed good or certainly a net societal gain.\nEqually, however, post-Catholic Ireland is plainly enough the scene of\nenormous, disorientating changes \u2014 in demography, in housing, in employment\nand economics.\n\n> The country\u2019s sexual constitution, both written and unwritten, has been\n> completely upended\n\nAnd there is also much going on a layer or two below these mega-trends. The\ncountry\u2019s sexual constitution, both written and unwritten, has been completely\nupended, as signalled most notably by the abortion and equal marriage\nreferendums of the 2010s. But in the culture too everything has changed. I\nrecall leaving Shannon Airport a couple of years ago and passing a billboard\nadvert for RTE\u2019s new drama season. It featured a seductively lit hotel\nbedroom, crumpled bed sheets, discarded shoes and underwear, an ice bucket, a\ntoppled champagne flute, and the brash but knowing legend \u201cLocal drama always\nleaves its wedding ring at home\u201d. The national broadcaster, which had employed\nthe cross of St Brigid as its logo as recently as 1995, was now flying the\nflag for adultery.\n\nSimilarly, the Queen of Ireland may once have been, according to the hymn, Our\nLady of Knock, but in Irish public life these days the title belongs squarely\nto Panti Bliss, a drag artist and activist, who last month accompanied the\nMinister for Education to London to act as Grand Marshal for the St Patrick\u2019s\nDay Parade. Back in Dublin, the symbol of the annual, four-day, government-\nfunded St Patrick\u2019s Festival is not the saint but a serpent. A non-binary,\nhalf-Swedish witch is representing the country at Eurovision. Newspapers are\nbursting with advice on throupling, friends with benefits, and botox.\n\nThis headlong rush into a radically un-Catholic Ireland has not been\nuntroubled. Driving the Church from the field does not seem to have led to a\nsafer system of public care: in 2022, academics from University College Dublin\npublished a report claiming that girls in residential care, and those who go\nmissing, are being targeted for sexual exploitation by gangs of predatory men.\nThere is much state-level dysfunction in other areas where the Church once\nheld sway: the cost of the new National Children\u2019s Hospital has spiralled to\nsuch an extent that, even though the hospital remains unfinished and unopened,\nit now appears in Wikipedia\u2019s list of the most expensive buildings in the\nworld, somewhere between One World Trade Centre and the Burj Khalifa. Among\ncertain hospitals that are open, stories of neglect and malpractice, both\ntragic and catastrophic, cause consternation.\n\n> The state of the city centres in places such as Dublin and Cork has become a\n> subject of intense concern\n\nThe one-time \u201cbest Catholics in the world\u201d are now the biggest cocaine users\nin Europe. Barbaric crimes that in Graham Linehan and Stella O\u2019Malley\u2019s\nchildhoods would have caused national soul-searching for months and years now\nseem to come and go from the headlines and public discussion in a matter of\nweeks or even days. The state of the city centres in places such as Dublin and\nCork has become a subject of intense concern, when it comes to public safety,\ndrug taking, dereliction, and the disappearance of small family businesses.\nConsumerism seems to be flooding every crevice of life: Kristy Kreme is adding\nFirst Holy Communion doughnuts to its Irish range.\n\nAll in all, it seems fair to say then that, even as the most distant of\nideals, Eamon de Valera\u2019s much-derided vision of \u201cthe Ireland that we dreamed\nof\u201d \u2014 \u201cthe home of a people who valued material wealth only as a basis for\nright living, of a people who, satisfied with frugal comfort, devoted their\nleisure to the things of the spirit (...) The home, in short, of a people\nliving the life that God desires that men should live\u201d \u2014 has been reduced to\n\u201csmoke in a gale, dust in the wind\u201d, to borrow a phrase from Cork poet Theo\nDorgan. Back in 2009, Dorgan, was pondering \u201cthe damage done in our country\u2019s\nshort-lived flirtation with mammon\u201d, and worrying about the future of \u201cthe\nfoundational ideals of justice, charity, compassion and mercy\u201d. The Irish, he\nwrote, \u201cwould do well to begin thinking clearly, and very soon, about what we\nwill choose for the moral foundations of a post-Catholic Ireland.\u201d\n\nDid Dorgan\u2019s warning go unheeded? Well, the current state of things has\nprompted Ireland\u2019s superstar millennial novelist Sally Rooney to observe that:\n\nFree-market ideology has replaced Catholic ideology. We see that as liberating\nbecause we have things like the contraceptive pill now, which is good, but\nwhat has replaced the values we had on community, family and things like that?\nThe free market has nothing to say about, no concern for, and in fact has even\nopen hostility towards these things. To me, it doesn\u2019t seem like\nstraightforward progress. We got rid of the Catholic Church and replaced it\nwith predatory capitalism. In some ways that was a good trade off, and in\nother ways, really bad.\n\nWhatever one makes of it, change of this kind, on this scale, at this pace, in\na close-knit society like Ireland that has abandoned without yet replacing its\nonce venerated source of values and rules, was probably going to spook people\neventually \u2014 and to prompt the backward glances of the kind Linehan, O\u2019Malley\nand Rooney have been giving to some of the more benign aspects of the ancien\nr\u00e9gime. It is also now increasingly open season when it comes to debating and\ncontesting the benefits of developments such as large-scale immigration or\nlegislation to tackle hate speech. And the bruises inflicted by exceptionally\nsevere Covid restrictions are also still being felt.\n\nWhat is staggering, then, is that the political class decided that this would\nbe a good time to push even more change by tinkering unconvincingly with\nclauses in the constitution touching on home and the family and by proposing\nto erase the word \u201cmother\u201d from the constitution altogether. One explanation,\ntherefore, of the result of the recent referendums is that many Irish people\ntook up the invitation unintentionally extended by politicians and activists\nto \u2014 pace William F Buckley, himself a distant son of Erin \u2014 to stand athwart\nhistory and yell \u201cStop!\u201d\n\nWhat happens next is uncertain. Ireland has gone far and fast on its journey\ninto modernity and post-modernity, in ways that \u2014 even if most people came to\nsee such a course of action as broadly desirable \u2014 would be very hard to undo.\nPost-referendums, Irish politics does seem to have entered a kind of\ninterregnum; but the latest Taoiseach-swap \u2014 Simon Harris for Leo Varadkar \u2014\ncould open the way to a slow return to business as usual, ushered along by a\ncertain amount of stage managed gestures, showy concessions, and rhetorical\nflourishes \u2013 all calculated to demonstrate that \u201cwe\u2019ve listened\u201d \u2014 plus an\neasing off some of the wilder activism.\n\nBut nothing is certain. Keep your eye on Ireland: The period between now and\nthe general election next year, which includes forthcoming local and European\npolls two months from now, could get quite wild.\n\nShare\n\n## Enjoying The Critic online?
