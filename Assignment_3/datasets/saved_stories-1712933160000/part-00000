The cover\nfeatures a photo of a 1972 work by prominent contemporary artist Mel Bochner\ntitled Meditation on the Theorem of Pythagoras.\n\nThe artwork references the idea of relating the lengths of the sides of a\n3-4-5 right triangle to the areas of the squares on those sides. To create the\npiece, Bochner used chalk and hazelnuts placed directly on the floor,\nmaterials that would have been familiar to Pythagoras. The construction\nrepresented his response to a visit to a temple in Metapontum, the city where\nPythagoras purportedly died.\n\nFor some, the artwork represents a mathematical bungle. A contributor to the\n360 blog, for example, wrote recently: \"If the intent was to illustrate a\nright triangle, then the arrangement of hazelnuts is off.\" 360 is the\nunofficial blog of the Nazareth College math department in Rochester, N.Y.,\nand features contributors from the college, local rival St. John Fisher\nCollege, and elsewhere.\n\n\"To my eye,\" the commenter continued, \"the hazelnut grids look exactly like\npins on a Geoboard, or lattice points in the plane. And given that perspective\non this image, we see a 2-3-4 triangle, an obtuse triangle, and squares of\narea 4, 9, and 16.\" So, from that viewpoint, the mathematics isn't correct.\n\nThe commenter then presented his own version of what the artist might have\nmeant in illustrating \"the fundamental ideas of relating the lengths of the\nsides of a triangle to the areas of the squares on those sides using readily\navailable materials.\"\n\nIn the end, the critic wrote, \"I find Bochner's Meditation rather confusing,\nand to some extent disappointing.\"\n\nIn response, CMJ Editor Michael Henle of Oberlin College noted that Bochner's\ncreation is still \"marvelously evocative\" of the Pythagorean Theorem, a common\nthread that links several articles in the January issue of CMJ. \"This is,\nafter all, a work of art, not mathematics,\" he added.\n\nMoreover, the Pythagorean Theorem \"is more than a piece of mathematics,\" Henle\nsaid. It is \"also a piece of our culture and history over 2500 years old.\" The\ntheorem, he noted, \"still says what it says and Meditation on the Theorem of\nPythagoras says something different.\"\n\nMel Bochner had his own rejoinder. He had visited the deserted temple on a\ncold and wet day in 1972, finding it little more than a few reconstructed\ncolumns, some ancient debris, and scattered building stones. Nonetheless, he\nstrongly sensed the presence of Pythagoras and had the urge to commemorate\nthat feeling.\n\nRemembering his 10th-grade geometry (3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2, or 9 + 16 = 25), Bochner\ngathered 50 small stones from the temple debris and laid them down. But when\nhe created his pattern, he found that he had three stones left over. Finally,\nit dawned upon him that the surplus came from counting the corners of the\ntriangle twice.\n\n\"What I had stumbled upon was that physical entities (stones) are not\nequatable with conceptual entities (points),\" Bochner said, \"or the real does\nnot map onto the ideal.\"\n\nThat's \"why the title of the work is Meditation on the Theorem of Pythagoras\nand not simply Theorem of Pythagoras,\" Bochner noted, \"and also why art is not\nan illustration of ideas but a reflection upon them.\"\n\nBochner welcomed the rediscovery of this \"discrepancy\" so many years after he\nhad created the artwork. Yet he also wondered \"about the unwillingness to\nassume that I already knew what they had just discovered (do mathematicians\nstill think all artists are dumb?) and not take the next step and ask\nthemselves if it might have been intended to be 'confusing.'\"\n\nHenle is pleased with the ongoing debate. \"This is the kind of thing I hoped\nwould happen,\" he said.\n\nPosted by\n\nMath

surplus, and the representation would have been correct\n\n    5:24 PM\n\nAnonymous said...\n\n    \n\nYes, vish is right....While I agree that the \"real does not map onto the\nideal,\" this piece is not an illustration of this idea because the artist is\nusing the wrong \"map\" in the first place.\n\n    6:22 PM\n\nPost a Comment\n\nNewer Post Older Post Home\n\nSubscribe to: Post Comments
