All prices\nare subject to change, and this article only reflects the prices available at\ntime of publication.\n\nThe LattePanda Mu is a 70 x 60mm (2.8\u2032\u2032 x 2.4\u2032\u2032) compute module with an Intel\nProcessor N100 chip, 8GB of RAM, 64GB of onboard storage, 9 PCIe 3.0 lanes,\nand support for up to three displays, two SATA drives, or other hardware.\n\nAvailable from DFRobot with a list price of $139, the LattePanda Mu will be\navailable for an early bird price of $99 for the first week after launch. But\nkeep in mind that in order to actually use this board, you\u2019re going to need to\npair it with a carrier board for ports, power supply, and other features.\n\nThe good news is that there are a few options for doing that. There\u2019s a Lite\nCarrier Board that sells for $39 and a larger \u201cFull-Function Evaluation\nCarrier Board\u201d priced at $89.\n\nLattePanda has also open sourced the carrier board designs and libraries for\nfolks that would prefer to design and manufacture their own.\n\nThe company says part of the idea behind offering the Mu as system-on-a-module\n(SOM) rather than a more traditional motherboard is that it allows users to\ndesign their own carrier boards for a variety of applications depending on\nwhether they\u2019re looking to use the system as a router, network-attached-\nstorage device, general purpose computer, or even a cluster board.\n\nLattePanda Mu Lite carrier boardLattePanda Mu Full Function carrier board\n\nAt the heart of the SOM is an Intel Processor N100 chip with 4 cores, 4\nthreads, CPU speeds up to 3.4 GHz and an Intel UHD iGPU with 24 execution\nunits and speeds up to 750 MHz. Intel positions the chip as a 6 watt\nprocessor, but LattePanda says the TDP can be adjusted to run anywhere from 6\nwatts to 35 watts.\n\nOther features include:\n\n  * 8GB LPDDR5-4800 memory\n  * 64GB eMMC 5.1 storage\n  * Up to 3 displays supported simultaneously (1 x eDP 1.4 or up to 3 HDMI 2.0 or DisplayPort 1.4)\n  * Up to 9 PCIe 3.0 lanes\n  * Up to 2 SATA 3.0 connections\n  * Up to 4 USB 3.2 Gen 2 ports or up to 8 USB 2.0 ports\n  * 4 x I2C\n  * 4 x UART\n  * Expandable to 64 GPIOs\n  * 9~20V power\n\nThe company notes that the board should be compatible with a wide range of\noperating systems including Windows and most GNU/Linux distributions.\n\n## Support Liliputing\n\nLiliputing's primary sources of revenue are advertising and affiliate links\n(if you click the \"Shop\" button at the top of the page and buy something on\nAmazon, for example, we'll get a small commission).\n\nBut there are several ways you can support the site directly even if you're\nusing an ad blocker* and hate online shopping.\n\n### Contribute to our Patreon campaign\n\nor...\n\n### Contribute via PayPal\n\n* If you are using an ad blocker like uBlock Origin and seeing a pop-up message at the bottom of the screen, we have a guide that may help you disable it.\n\n## Subscribe to Liliputing via Email\n\nJoin 9,543 other subscribers\n\nTagged: alder lake n, lattepanda, lattepanda mu, som\n\n## Leave a comment\n\nCancel reply\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
