The PS1\nsection is half empty. The tourists have taken everything. I don\u2019t bother\nshopping for retro games in big Japanese cities anymore.\"\n\nJia adds that his local Surugaya once offered two whole floors of games, but\nnow it is reduced to just one \u2013 and that he personally witnessed someone\nliterally scooping up an entire shelf of stock. \"I saw a guy just taking\neverything off the already paltry DS shelf. There [are] tons of people like\nhim and very little anyone can do because it\u2019s obviously not illegal. So I\ndon\u2019t even bother anymore.\"\n\nHowever, the researcher is keen to stress that he has no issue with people\nbuying up games to play \u2013 it's the resellers he's less keen on. \"I should\nspecify that if you\u2019re a tourist in Japan and buying these games because you\ngenuinely want to play them, I don\u2019t have an issue with you,\" Jia says. \"It\u2019s\nthe people who clear entire shelves just to scalp them online when they get\nhome that ruin the hobby here for everyone.\"\n\n> The Surugaya in Kyoto is a skeleton now.\n>\n> A year ago there were tons of Famicom Disk System games, but this is all\n> that\u2019s left.\n>\n> The PS1 section is half empty.\n>\n> The tourists have taken everything.

I\u2019m fully aware that\n> the economy needs it, but there are always trade-offs to over-tourism on\n> locals. So we have to deal with that for the near future.\n>\n> Demand for retro video games and other similar nostalgic items comes and\n> goes. We\u2019re currently in a period where there\u2019s high demand. But once that\n> demand is satiated, prices and supply tend to stabilize again. I anticipate\n> it\u2019s going to take about five years at best.\n\nWhile this is certainly a sad situation, it's hard to see how it can be\nresolved; retro games, by their very nature, are a 'finite' resource. While\nscalpers and resellers from outside of Japan are certainly speeding up the\nprocess, sooner or later, retro stock is going to get harder and harder to\ncome by \u2013 especially when you're talking about items which are over 30 years\nold.\n\nHowever, it's easy to see why Japanese residents might take issue with\ntourists flagrantly lifting entire shelves of stock in order to simply flip\nthem online, rather than to actually play and enjoy them.\n\nJia adds that he now shops for his retro items online, as \"you need a Japanese\naddress to get stuff shipped, so it\u2019s generally stuff tourists won\u2019t find.\"\n\n## Related Articles\n\n### Guide Retro Game Shopping In Tokyo, Japan\n\nThe place where you can find everything\n\n### News Japanese Retro Arcade That Took 10 Years To Build Goes Up In Flames\n\n\"We never imagined it would end like this\"\n\n### News Japanese Second-Hand Stores Are Making Their Own Famiclones To Cope\nWith Retro Demand\n\n\"Sales have doubled at some stores\"\n\n  * Share:\n  * 0\n\n  * 0\n  * 23\n\nAbout Damien McFerran\n\nDamien has been writing professionally about tech and video games since 2007\nand oversees all of Hookshot Media's sites from an editorial perspective.

And then paralleling it is the industry\u2019s own practice of turning\neverything within a modern video game into currency, and that gold rush is on.\nThere\u2019s a dollar pursuit on all sides\n\n  * 3\n  * Reply\n\n  * 2\n  * JayJ\n  * Yesterday, 10:13am\n\nThis sort of thing is just a product of the effect that all the scalpers,\nscammers, and opportunists have had on the retro gaming market these days.\nPeople buying up copies of old games to jack up the prices on them, rich\npeople turning rated sealed video games into a money laundering scheme making\nit crazy overpriced, and just scammers and opportunists all over trying to get\nanything they can for them. A part of the problem is youtubers and social\nmedia influencers, another part is the Ebay/Amazon culture of selling stuff,\nthe collecting scene has been ruined by all the people trying to make money\noff it, and it really sucks for all those gamers who just really had a passion\nfor it. I'm glad I was into collecting before everything got so crazy.\n\n  * 6\n  * Reply\n\n  * 3\n  * boatie\n  * Yesterday, 10:23am\n\nOne foreigner criticises other foreigners because HE'S the SPECIAL one who\nlives there.\n\n  * 4\n  * Reply\n\n  * 4\n  * LowDefAl\n  * Yesterday, 10:34am\n\n\u201c Jia adds that he now shops for his retro items online, as \"you need a\nJapanese address to get stuff shipped, so it\u2019s generally stuff tourists won\u2019t\nfind.\"\u201d\n\nYeah about that, more Japanese goods are bought by foreigners on those sites\nfrom outside Japan than are buying them as \u201ctourists\u201d from within Japan. One\nproxy alone has 2million registered customers, although obviously they aren\u2019t\nall buying games.\n\nAlso the yen is pretty weak right now and the Japanese are definitely not\naverse to scalping either.\n\nI\u2019m sure Suruga-ya would rather foreigners buy their cheap games than them\nsitting on the shelves collecting dust.\n\n  * 3\n  * Reply\n\n  * 5\n  * Guru_Larry\n  * Yesterday, 11:06am\n\n'Tis true, Americans have also taken all our copies of Mega Man: The Wily Wars\nand Shenmue II.\n\nThen again, we've taken a load of their copies of Earthbound, Super Mario RPG\nand Chrono Trigger.\n\nExclusivity migration is an issue caused by the original publishers back in\nthe day.\n\nAlso, That \"you need a Japanese address\" can easily be flaunted, there's loads\nof companies that will act as a proxy for you to ship stuff to them, and then\nthem to you. I did that a few years ago for a Japanese auction site for a\ncollection of Sega Titan Games.\n\n  * 4\n  * Reply\n\n  * 6\n  * Fighting_Game_Loser\n  * Yesterday, 11:06am\n\nAnd the sad thing is most of the online sellers are getting all of these on\nthe cheap, and then selling them online in the US for prices like they\nactually imported with stupid fees, but obviously didn't.\n\n  * 3\n  * Reply\n\n  * 7\n  * GhaleonUnlimited\n  * Yesterday, 11:47am\n\n@JayJ Yeah, I know these YouTube people expose people to games they didn't\nknow about, but it sucks ass reading about some obscure Playstation 2 or Mega\nDrive game and you already know it's going to be $50-200 on ebay now.\n\nSNES is the worst. \"Oh, Metal Warriors. I never heard of this before... Oh,\nit's $400 loose. Wtf\".\n\nAnd worse is that people let these sit on ebay way overpriced, so you really\nhave to wait for an auction go get a remotely fair priced game. And if there's\nlike one auction up you have a bidding war to deal with.\n\nI started being able to buy lots of old games in 2000, when I started college\n(USA) , and it was so exciting to go to a used store and find something you'd\nread about years before. \"Oh cool, Mega Man 7 for $7.\" \"Awesome, Snatcher!\n$15, cool.\" (Real pickups).\n\nAnd yeah, JP stores are amazing. It sucks to see stuff that was super cheap\nlike boxed SNES RPGs steadily climbing just because people want to stare at\nit.\n\nYouTube culture really emphasis just having these things sit on a shelf for\nyour video background, and people even back to AVGN are completely\ndisingenuous about the actual games.\n\nI enjoy the fan translation scene a lot because people are working really hard\nso people can just enjoy games they couldn't otherwise and (generally) aren't\ndoing it for money, it's a passion thing.\n\n  * 4\n  * Reply\n\n  * 8\n  * rob7979\n  * Yesterday, 12:57pm\n\nYour guide series to shopping in for retro games in Japan are obviously a\nlittle to successful!!\n\n  * 1\n  * Reply\n\n  * 9\n  * Nahhhtendo\n  * Yesterday, 1:56pm\n\n@boatie That was definitely my take away from this as well.

I should note that my\nlocal retro stores sell JP games/systems cheap and I think it is because not a\nlot of people but them.\n\nI just feel sad for those younger kids who will never have the experience of\nwalking through a game store and picking up 5 good games for $40. No more\n\"this looks interesting and is only $5\" pick ups. I still have my copy of Duck\nHunt with the price sticker on the back, which reads $0.29. It probably sells\nfor $10 today even though most people don't have a CRT to play it. Oh well.\n\n  * 2\n  * Reply\n\n  * 11\n  * Sketcz\n  * Yesterday, 4:37pm\n\nBuying online and the JP address means nothing. As pointed out by @LowDefAl\nproxy sites solve this.\n\nI spoke to Joseph of the GPS, and according to research done by Beep, the\nfigure he quoted me was, something like 70% of games sold on Japanese auction\nsites end up leaving the country. Way above half.\n\nI do it myself - scalpers and speculators on UK ebay have jacked up prices to\nsuch insane heights, with items that sit getting endlessly relisted\n(artificially inflating the sense of value these items have), that even after\ndomestic shipping within Japan, handling fees, import tax, and postage out of\nJapan to my house, an item via proxy is STILL cheaper than from these filthy\ndamned local scalpers.\n\nI feel bad for the Japanese. Or people who live there, regardless of origin.\nEven foreigners in Japan.\n\nAround 2001 it was a paradise. Even in 2013 when I went again, it was OK. Lose\ngames, controllers, all sorts were fairly priced and abundant.\n\nI absolutely blame the speculators. Places like Wata and Heritage Auctions.\nThey put games in plastic coffins, sell stuff for millions, speculators see\nthis and want in on the investing action. Boom! All domestic prices rise\nastronomically. So legitimate players turn to importing direct.\n\nIt's over for Japan. It'll never recover.\n\nNow the wealthy collectors are travelling further afield in Asia. Hong Kong,\nThailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, etc.\n\nThey're buying the Japanese games which had been imported into these countries\nback in the day, and which still haven't yet been picked clean by speculators\nand scalpers.\n\n  * 3\n  * Reply\n\n  * 12\n  * Dramlin\n  * Yesterday, 5:01pm\n\nThe U.S retro market is messed up. Take Panzer Dragoon Saga for example, which\nis averaging at $555 just for the discs. Then you've got the NTSJ version\nwhich can be had for less than $30. That's not an isolated case. Most $100+\nEnglish games can be had for cheap in their NTSJ forms, which is definitely\ngoing to cause a market for NTSJ games to rise in price and still sell as a\nbargain compared to the English versions. This will lead to resellers\nprofiting, and it has nothing to do with foreigners or tourists. Unfortunately\ngame prices will rise and that's just how it's going to be until demand goes\ndown.\n\n  * 3\n  * Reply\n\n  * 13\n  * LowDefAl\n  * Yesterday, 5:03pm\n\n@Sketcz Beep are an outlier though because they know their auctions, which are\noften for very specific items that aren\u2019t always freely available elsewhere\nare going to proxy sites because that\u2019s where the market is and they will make\nmore money by doing so. They also actively encourage foreign buyers on their\nweb store. They also start all their listings at 1yen which encourages people\nto bid more freely. While the group that owns beep operate multiple auction\naccounts and sell both console and computer items, their console stuff is\nlargely ten a penny. People follow their auctions because they have the stuff\nthat is hard to find and it\u2019s just easier to watch their account.\n\nWhereas the people who block proxies are loosing money by doing so or their\nitems sit around not moving because Japanese interest is so low.\n\n  * 1\n  * Reply\n\n  * 14\n  * BugCatcherGarl\n  * Yesterday, 5:32pm\n\nAt least money is going into the economy.

The early\n2000s were kind of the golden age for that sort of thing, when prices weren't\nridiculously inflated. I remember picking up a used dreamcast copy of\nMvC2,(which I still have incidentally), for no more than 30-40 bucks,\n(canadian), now it's closer to $300, yeesh.\n\n  * 4\n  * Reply\n\n  * 17\n  * EvilLives\n  * Yesterday, 11:49pm\n\n@OldManHermit I'm ready to just sell most of my stuff and rely on emulation.\nAs much as I am a purist that prefers to play on original hardware,\nspeculation and scalpers have ruined it for me. I can honestly use the money\nto put a down payment on a single family home when I do that, which shouldn't\neven be a thing, but I've been collecting since I was 13 years old which is a\nlittle over 30 years ago. It's a functional collection too when I have time to\nplay it. I'm going to do my best to make sure that whomever I sell my stuff to\nactually isn't a scalper but I kind of am done with collecting with market\nbeing so toxic and I could use the space buying a house for my dogs and rest\nof my family...\n\n  * 0\n  * Reply\n\n  * 18\n  * Steel76\n  * 12:02am\n\nI collected the games I used to own, on the NES, back in the 80:s. Around\n40-45 games total. But after that, I quit collecting cart/discs. I have some\nAnalogue consoles, for the few SNES and Mega Drive carts I have, but mostly\nuse them for roms. And I also modded my Saturn and PS2, to run games from SD\ncards and HDD. I don't ever wanna deal with discs and dying lasers ever again.\nCollecting physical retro games, just isn't fun anymore. It becomes too much\nclutter.\n\n  * 3\n  * Reply\n\n  * 19\n  * OldManHermit\n  * 12:37am\n\n@EvilLives Yeah, if emulation works for you, then you absolutely should! If\nthe end goal is acquiring a space for yourself and your family, seems totally\nworthwhile to me. Definitely hold onto the games you have the most sentimental\nvalue for, I'm sure you know the ones. I'm not opposed to selling off my\ncollection one day either, but there's certain games I don't think I could\npart with haha.\n\n  * 2\n  * Reply\n\n  * 20\n  * TimChuma\n  * 1:34am\n\n\"Welcome to my world! ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!\" With all the weeaboo gamers putting\nup \"retro game guides\" to shopping in Japan it wasn't going to be long until\nit was picked clean. No market is immune it happened over the pandemic\neverywhere else. A lot of people are saying not to go to the main stores in\nTokyo these days at all as stuff is either overpriced or sold out. Even retro\nstuff in local cashies and opp shops is way overpriced now, Master System\ngames in particular seem to not turn up at all or cost way more than you would\nthink.\n\n  * 1\n  * Reply\n\n  * 21\n  * Bakamoichigei\n  * 4:35pm\n\nWell, it was only a matter of time before we ruined their retro games market\ntoo. I'm not going to pretend for even a second that I'm not part of the\nproblem (having racked up like a grand in shipping fees alone in the past\nyear, on massive proxied hauls of SFC and PSX games) but to my credit, every\nbit of it is for personal consumption. I also preserve and reverse-engineer\nobscurities and esoterica.\n\n  * 0\n  * Reply\n\n  * 22\n  * TechaNinja\n  * 5:47pm\n\nThe thing about this is that sometimes older and newer games just sit there\nbeing ignored.\n\nI went to Japan Sept 2023 and I had found some specific games I wanted limited\nedition of (Japanese only limited edition, regular or digital in West only)\nwere in stock at specific places.\n\nI checked about a month before the trip and then when I went, I found those on\nmy list still there. Meaning no one was interested in them during that time\nperiod.\n\nThe same could also go for some retro games too. Sometimes they just sit there\nfor ages and it takes a non local to buy it, since no one locally wants it.\n\n  * 0\n  * Reply\n\n  * 23\n  * TechaNinja\n  * 5:55pm\n\nAnd yeah it's lame as heck the people buying rarer japanese games and stuff to\nsell online for 3x price or more.\n\nI buy games in Japan for certain reasons.\n\n1\\. Limited Edition is Japanese only OR they got a cooler Limited Edition then\nthe West\n\n2\\. Japanese version of a game that was digital only in West.\n\n3\\. Game only released in Japan.\n\n4\\. Western game that's cheaper then buying it back in Australia with added\nbonus usually of having Japanese dub and sub (alongside english). I've gotten\ngames for half price and under compared to Australia version.\n\n5\\. A game / franchise I love and want to collect cheap older copies of em for\ncollection purposes (I have older Yakuza and Trails games from Japan cheap\nyay)\n\n  * 0\n  * Reply\n\nTap here to load 23 comments\n\nLeave A Comment\n\nHold on there, you need to login to post a comment...\n\n## Related Articles\n\n  * All Is Not Well In The World Of FPGA Retro Gaming\n\nSocial media blocking, apology videos and system delays - what's going wrong?\n\n  * \"The Tourists Have Taken Everything\" Laments Japanese Resident As Retro Runs Dry\n\n\"I don\u2019t bother shopping for retro games in big Japanese cities anymore\"\n\n  * 33 Years Later, Game Boy Title's 16-Player Mode Is Finally Unlocked\n\nFaceball 2000, the way it was meant to be played\n\n  * One Of The Rarest NES Games Is Currently Up For Auction At Goodwill\n\nLittle Samson is highly sought after by collectors\n\n  * Former Citra Dev Says Team Behind 3DS Emulator Lemonade Stole His Code\n\n\"This is highly disrespectful\"\n\nPopular Right Now\n\n  * \"The Tourists Have Taken Everything\" Laments Japanese Resident As Retro Runs Dry\n\nYesterday, 9am\n\n  * All Is Not Well In The World Of FPGA Retro Gaming\n\nWed, 12pm\n\n  * One Of The Rarest NES Games Is Currently Up For Auction At Goodwill\n\nThu, 11:45am\n\n  * Former Citra Dev Says Team Behind 3DS Emulator Lemonade Stole His Code\n\nThu, 1:45pm\n\n  * Hands On: Xeno Crisis On SNES Really Is A Dream Come True\n\nThu, 11:35am\n\n  * 33 Years Later, Game Boy Title's 16-Player Mode Is Finally Unlocked\n\nMon, 10:05am\n\n  * Dev Behind MiSTer's \"Impossible\" N64 FPGA Core Is Working On A Game Next\n\nThu, 2:30pm\n\n  * Random: Gamers Are Using 3DSen To Play NES Games In Mixed Reality\n\nTue, 10:45am\n\n  * Guide: The Best Retro Gaming Gifts - April 2024\n\nMon, 1pm\n\n  * You Can Now Control Your Switch Using Your GBA\n\nYesterday, 2:30pm\n\n  * 'Sunsoft Is Back! - Retro Game Selection' Will Get English Options After All\n\nThu, 9am\n\n  * Review: Piko Interactive Collection 4 (Evercade) - N64 Emulation Comes To Evercade\n\nYesterday, 2:05pm\n\nShow More\n\n\u00a9 2024 Hookshot Media, partner of ReedPop.
