Submit an\nanonymous question here.\n\nP.S. Don\u2019t miss my video podcast production service (focusing on podcasts in\nthe sex, relationships, leftist space), Glamorous and Polyamorous (my podcast\nwith my partner about exploring polyamory after leaving religion) and Violet\nPaniko\u2019s swag store.\n\nDear Xavi,\n\nMy friend and I recently started a podcast and I\u2019m looking for any and all\nadvice. We record in Riverside so it\u2019s video as well, but I\u2019m not loving the\nediting capabilities. I\u2019m currently using CapCut but I can\u2019t send edits to my\nco-host.\n\nWhat are your editing recommendations?\n\nI\u2019d like something that allows me to create clips for social media.\n\nLastly, what platforms should I distribute the podcast to? Currently on\nSpotify and Apple Podcasts.\n\n\u2014Just Starting Out\n\nXavi Benjamin is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and\nsupport my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.\n\nDear Just Starting Out,\n\nThanks so much for this question! Congratulations on your new podcast. I\u2019m so\nhappy for you on your new adventure!\n\nRecording in Riverside is great. It\u2019s a well-designed experience. The paid\nversion of their software however is going to get you better quality\nrecordings, and live streaming capabilities. I think it\u2019s more worth it for\nthe live streaming, but we\u2019ll come back to it when we talk about your later\nquestion on distribution.\n\nMy opinion changes on whether you should publish the entire show in video or\nnot. But that\u2019s probably for a different article. I will say it's a good idea\nto record your podcast in video format for promotional reasons alone. So good\non you for doing that.\n\n##\n\nEditing Your Show\n\nCapCut has a lot of great features out of the box. But if you want a more\nfully fledged editor, look at apps like Premiere Pro or DaVinci Resolve. The\nlatter of which has a free option.\n\nBoth of these are used by professional editors and have quite a learning\ncurve. The decision of whether to learn these apps yourself comes down to\ntime, budget, and intention. If you want to learn how to edit your own\npodcasts and have interest in helping others with this skill, learning it\nmight be a great idea.\n\nBoth of those editing apps will allow you to create custom social media clips.\nOpus Clip is a helpful tool I\u2019ve used to take my podcast videos and create\nshort-form clips. It\u2019s a huge timesaver and even integrates with Premiere Pro.\n\nYour other option is to hire a video podcast editor. I happen to know a good\none \ud83d\ude09 An external editor can be great because it gets you a third-party\nperspective on your show. If you hire the right editor, they\u2019ll easily elevate\nit.\n\n##\n\nLive streaming and distribution\n\nI\u2019ve become bullish on live streaming. It\u2019s a way to create more interaction\nwith your audience, it helps keep you consistent, makes creation of your\ncontent much easier, and can be a way to distribute your show instantly after\nyou\u2019ve recorded it.\n\nBut first, let\u2019s address your question on distribution. The short answer is\nthis: distribute your podcast to every place you possibly can. One of those\nplaces should be YouTube.\n\nI do want to acknowledge that YouTube is like every other censorious platform\nin the United States (i.e. Facebook, Instagram, and yes X as well): only\ntopics within their Overton Window are allowed. I\u2019ve seen them demonetize\nseveral creators I love, and anyone who creates political content on YouTube\nunderstands this. Many creators have started streaming and uploading to sites\nlike Rumble, Rockfin, Kick, and others as a way to diversify.\n\nThat being said, YouTube is the largest podcast platform in the world.\nYouTube\u2019s unmatched search and discovery opens opportunities to be discovered\nby new listeners looking for exactly what your podcast offers.\n\nWhen you livestream on YouTube, your entire broadcast is turned into a video\nthat can be replayed later. Even the live chat is replayed for viewers.\nYouTube comments are another way for discussion to happen around each of your\nepisodes.\n\nI\u2019m not saying to put all of your eggs in the YouTube basket, but I think it\u2019s\nan essential platform to have a presence on. Direct people from there to a\nsafe place, like Substack or Rumble.\n\nWishing you all the best with your podcast \u2764\ufe0f\n\nWhat did you think of this advice? Let me know in the comments below.
