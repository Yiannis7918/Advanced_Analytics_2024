These repositories contain obfuscated\nmalware that steals passwords and cryptocurrency from developer devices,\nresearchers said.\n\nThe malicious repositories are clones of legitimate ones, making them hard to\ndistinguish to the casual eye. An unknown party has automated a process that\nforks legitimate repositories, meaning the source code is copied so developers\ncan use it in an independent project that builds on the original one. The\nresult is millions of forks with names identical to the original one that add\na payload that\u2019s wrapped under seven layers of obfuscation. To make matters\nworse, some people, unaware of the malice of these imitators, are forking the\nforks, which adds to the flood.\n\n## Whack-a-mole\n\n\u201cMost of the forked repos are quickly removed by GitHub, which identifies the\nautomation,\u201d Matan Giladi and Gil David, researchers at security firm Apiiro,\nwrote Wednesday. \u201cHowever, the automation detection seems to miss many repos,\nand the ones that were uploaded manually survive. Because the whole attack\nchain seems to be mostly automated on a large scale, the 1% that survive still\namount to thousands of malicious repos.\u201d\n\nGiven the constant churn of new repos being uploaded and GitHub\u2019s removal,\nit\u2019s hard to estimate precisely how many of each there are. The researchers\nsaid the number of repos uploaded or forked before GitHub removes them is\nlikely in the millions. They said the attack \u201cimpacts more than 100,000 GitHub\nrepositories.\u201d\n\nGitHub officials didn\u2019t dispute Apiiro\u2019s estimates and didn\u2019t answer other\nquestions sent by email. Instead, they issued the following statement:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n> GitHub hosts over 100M developers building across over 420M repositories,\n> and is committed to providing a safe and secure platform for developers. We\n> have teams dedicated to detecting, analyzing, and removing content and\n> accounts that violate our Acceptable Use Policies. We employ manual reviews\n> and at-scale detections that use machine learning and constantly evolve and\n> adapt to adversarial tactics. We also encourage customers and community\n> members to report abuse and spam.\n\nSupply-chain attacks that target users of developer platforms have existed\nsince at least 2016, when a college student uploaded custom scripts to\nRubyGems, PyPi, and NPM. The scripts bore names similar to widely used\nlegitimate packages but otherwise had no connection to them. A phone-home\nfeature in the student's scripts showed that the imposter code was executed\nmore than 45,000 times on more than 17,000 separate domains, and more than\nhalf the time his code was given all-powerful administrative rights. Two of\nthe affected domains ended in .mil, an indication that people inside the US\nmilitary had run his script. This form of supply-chain attack is often\nreferred to as typosquatting, because it relies on users making small errors\nwhen choosing the name of a package they want to use.\n\nIn 2021, a researcher used a similar technique to successfully execute\ncounterfeit code on networks belonging to Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, and dozens\nof other companies. The technique\u2014known as a dependency confusion or namespace\nconfusion attack\u2014started by placing malicious code packages in an official\npublic repository and giving them the same name as dependency packages Apple\nand the other targeted companies use in their products. Automated scripts\ninside the package managers used by the companies then automatically\ndownloaded and installed the counterfeit dependency code.\n\nThe technique observed by Apiiro is known as repo confusion.\n\n\u201cSimilar to dependency confusion attacks, malicious actors get their target to\ndownload their malicious version instead of the real one,\u201d Wednesday\u2019s post\nexplained. \u201cBut dependency confusion attacks take advantage of how package\nmanagers work, while repo confusion attacks simply rely on humans to\nmistakenly pick the malicious version over the real one, sometimes employing\nsocial engineering techniques as well.\u201d\n\n#### reader comments\n\n89\n\nDan Goodin Dan Goodin is Senior Security Editor at Ars Technica, where he\noversees coverage of malware, computer espionage, botnets, hardware hacking,\nencryption, and passwords.
