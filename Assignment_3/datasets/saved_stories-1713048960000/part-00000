When I\u2019m not in the\n\u201cstartup pitch\u201d mood, I default to, \u201cWe\u2019re Stripe Billing, but open source\u201d.\nOr my co-founder might say, \u201cWe\u2019re like an open-source Chargebee.\u201d Frankly, it\ngets the job done.\n\nOf course, if that\u2019s all there was to us, we would have failed by now. What\nwe\u2019ve learned is that open-source tools can\u2019t rely on being an open-source\nalternative to an already successful business. A developer can\u2019t just imitate\na product, tag on an MIT license, and call it a day. As awesome as open source\nis, in a vacuum, it\u2019s not enough to succeed.\n\nTo be clear, I\u2019m talking about open-source projects that compete with popular\npaid solutions. Commercial open source, so to speak. Some community-driven,\nsponsored products\u2014like React, TypeORM, or VSCode\u2014have different priorities.\nThey are either bankrolled by a larger organization (e.g., Meta for React) or\nrely on donations to fund development (e.g., TypeORM). They aren\u2019t businesses\nat heart.\n\nBut open-source companies, like us, need to be more than just an open-source\nalternative to succeed. They either need a concrete reason for why they are\nopen source or have to surpass their competitors.\n\n## Profit, not usage, is a measure of success\n\nExcluding non-profit projects that are sponsored by donations or parent\norganizations, a typical open-source business needs profit to be the ultimate\nnorth star.\n\nFor some, this might be a tough pill to swallow. But a for-profit business\nexists for profit. Definitionally and practically. Profit is what allows the\ncompany to hire employees, grow, and sustain itself\u2014it is quite literally what\nfunds ongoing development. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that; the fact that\nbusinesses can be profitable while building free software is a great thing.\nIt\u2019s not that open-source companies aspire to gouge customers\u2014but they do\naspire to remain in business.\n\nThis is precisely what has enabled MongoDB to grow into one of the largest\ndatabases with over 4,600 employees. (Granted, MongoDB eventually switched to\na special SSPL license to add specific restrictions on Cloud Providers from\ndistributing a service without contributing to the project, which isn\u2019t OSI\napproved, but is open-source practically).\n\nBut why make this point? Well, splitting the hair between profit and usage is\nimportant to measuring long-term success. If a project gets great adoption but\ncannot drive revenue, it will die. Some wishful thinking might argue that the\ncommunity will take over, but there\u2019s been little evidence to indicate this\nhappens.\n\n## How open source does not win\u2014by being cheaper\n\nCatering to the price-conscious is a losing battle.\n\nImagine a buddy who wants to create an open-source version of Amplitude. She\nargues that Amplitude is pretty expensive, particularly prohibitive for some\nearly-stage companies, and larger companies could save a fortune by using an\nopen-source version.\n\nIn theory, sure. While this pitch might resonate with early-stage companies,\nthose same price-conscious early-stage companies will either use an open-\nsource version or a free tier. That is not enough to sustain the business.\nBuilding a cheaper alternative is typically a ticket to future bankruptcy.\n\nWhat about larger companies? With some caveats, larger companies aren\u2019t\nworried about going out of business because their Amplitude is too expensive.\nThey might be price-conscious in terms of negotiating a contract in context of\ntheir budget, but most SaaS software is just a line item at the end of the\nday. What matters more is that the solution is (a) a good solution, (b) around\nfor the long haul, and (c) easy to manage. And, unfortunately, deploying an\nopen-source solution can be tricky to manage.\n\nThe caveat is if the solution is a massive cost on the overall budget, then a\ncorporation may seek out a more price-friendly solution; there are plenty of\ncompanies that needed to kick Oracle when their database costs skyrocketed due\nto usage. But most open-source solutions aren\u2019t replacing a top-three line\nitem, and therefore price isn\u2019t the north star deciding factor.\n\n## How open source wins\u2014by solving a transparency problem\n\nA great case for an open-source solution is when a transparency problem is\npresent. What is a transparency problem? It\u2019s when a solution being closed\nsource creates distrust between the client and vendor.\n\nLet\u2019s return to the previous example\u2014open-source Amplitude. That product\nactually does exist, and it is winning: PostHog. Growing with Airbus, DHL, and\nStaples as clients, PostHog combines a few product SaaS solutions together and\nis open source. It\u2019s actually super open source\u2014even the blog source code and\nroadmap is available publicly. We\u2019ve modeled a lot of our open-source mantras\nafter them.\n\nPostHog is positioned as a better product than its competitors because\nanalytics tools need to process sensitive client data such as IP addresses,\nnames, session recordings, etc. In a world of increasing data regulations\n(e.g., GDPR and CCPA), it can be daunting for third parties to store that\ndata. So PostHog provides an alternative\u2014either (a) self-host an analytics\nsolution yourself or (b) hire PostHog as a third party to do it, but with\ntransparency into how that data is stored and how possibly migrating to self-\nhosted in the future would work.\n\nThis split is important. Even if the most privacy-conscious technique is to\nself-host the open-source solution (which often leads to no revenue for the\ndeveloper), many companies will still opt for a hosted model. But they do so\nnow with assurances of how the software works\u2014line by line\u2014and the process of\nmigrating to a self-hosted model in the future if necessary. It\u2019s not that\nopen-source companies win by preventing the need for a third party; they win\nby allowing for the open audit of how it works.\n\nNowadays, there are many early open-source solutions taking advantage of these\nselling points. Medplum is an open-source electronic health record platform\ncompeting with closed-source incumbents; being open-source gives users\nassurance of exactly what is and isn\u2019t supported by the platform. SuperTokens\nis an open-source alternative to authentication solutions like Auth0; logins\ndeal with sensitive data including names, emails, and passwords, and by being\nopen source, Supertokens is able to capture more trust. TableFlow is an open-\nsource alternative to CSV import platforms like Flatfile; once again, the\nimported data is sensitive.\n\nOne of the biggest ones is Minio, which is an open-source alternative to AWS\nS3 storage. Given that S3 often stores customer PII (either inadvertently via\nscreenshots or actual structured JSON files), Minio is a great alternative to\ncompanies mindful of who has access to user data. Of course, AWS claims that\nAWS personnel doesn\u2019t have direct access to customer data, but by being\nclosed-source, that statement is just a function of trust.\n\nThe list goes on and on. We could say the same about our own story; we deal\nwith billing and product usage information, which is pretty high on the list\nof sensitive content. By being open source, we\u2019re able to better build trust\namong our users.\n\n## How open source wins\u2014by solving an extensibility problem\n\nOne of the big benefits of open source is that it opens the development of\nniche features to the community. While the core product is typically\nmaintained by a central engineering team, integrations or plugins are often\nbuilt by community developers and then occasionally merged into the main\nbranch. Conversely, closed-source solutions struggle with this because they\nrely on their engineering team.\n\nThis is particularly advantageous for open-source companies building systems\nthat require lots of connections with other libraries, frameworks, or\napplications. For instance, Airbyte, an open-source ELT platform, blew up\nbecause of community-driven additions to its connectors. The same could be\nsaid about Elastic, an even bigger originally open-source company that hosts a\nbastion of data integrations.\n\nOne of the founders I\u2019ve met is Advait Ruia of Supertokens. For them,\nextensibility was a core part of their value proposition, as their community\nmembers are able to build integrations with uncommon authentication providers,\nbenefiting everyone.\n\n## How open source wins\u2014by being better\n\nBoth of the above issues contribute to commercial open-source being a better\nproduct in the long run. But by tapping the community for feedback and help,\nopen-source projects can also accelerate past closed-source solutions.\nPostHog\u2014who raised a $15M Series B\u2014started as an alternative to Amplitude and\nFullStory, but has accelerated into a massive, encompassing solution that even\ncompetes with LaunchDarkly and Pendo. This happened over the last few years,\nand they heavily credit their community as one of the core reasons.\n\nOpen-source projects\u2014not just commercial open source\u2014have served as a critical\ndriver for the improvement of products for decades. However, some software is\ngoing to remain closed source. It\u2019s just the nature of first-mover advantage.\nBut when transparency and extensibility are an issue, an open-source successor\nbecomes a real threat.\n\n## Two hosting options, same benefits\n\nWhether you choose the cloud version or decide to host the solution yourself,\nyou will benefit from our powerful API and user-friendly interface.\n\n###### Open source\n\nThe optimal solution for small projects.\n\nDeploy Open Source\n\n###### Premium\n\nThe optimal solution for teams who want control and flexibility on cloud or\nself-hosted version.\n\nBook a demo\n\nSubscribe to our updates\n\nSign up for our newsletter, we promise not to spam you.\n\nThank you!
