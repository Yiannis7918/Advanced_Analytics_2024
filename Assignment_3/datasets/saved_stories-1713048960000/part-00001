We conduct experiments with algorithmic pricing agents based on\n> Large Language Models (LLMs), and specifically GPT-4. We find that (1) LLM-\n> based agents are adept at pricing tasks, (2) LLM-based pricing agents\n> autonomously collude in oligopoly settings to the detriment of consumers,\n> and (3) variation in seemingly innocuous phrases in LLM instructions\n> (\"prompts\") may increase collusion. These results extend to auction\n> settings. Our findings underscore the need for antitrust regulation\n> regarding algorithmic pricing, and uncover regulatory challenges unique to\n> LLM-based pricing agents.\n\nSubjects:| General Economics (econ.GN); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI);\nComputer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.00806 [econ.GN]  \n(or arXiv:2404.00806v1 [econ.GN] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.00806arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Sara Fish [view email] [v1] Sun, 31 Mar 2024 21:43:05 UTC (1,215 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Algorithmic Collusion by Large Language Models,\nby Sara Fish and 2 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\necon.GN\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI cs.GT econ q-fin q-fin.EC\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
