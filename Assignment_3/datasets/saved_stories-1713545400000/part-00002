This example is Outlook 2016, configuring a\nGMail account[1], but I've seen similar screens in other apps.\n\n\"Microsoft apps & services\" is ambiguous and the prompt doesn't make it clear\nwhether the access and information described will be shared with Microsoft or\nonly the local application I'm using.\n\nI'm not deeply familiar with OAuth but I know it involves tokens, challenges,\nresponses.\n\nDoes this authentication take place only between the software on my machine\nand Google's servers? Or does Microsoft's implementation rely on some of their\ncloud infrastructure to support the sign-in process?\n\ni.e. Does using this form of authentication 'ping' Microsoft in a way that\ncould leak to them the fact that I'm signing in?\n\nI understand how 'legacy' passwords work. You set up credentials in the\nsoftware and it presents them to the server when you want to authenticate.\n\nMy mental model of OAuth isn't as clear, and I want to understand the privacy\nimplications as the line between 'local' and 'cloud' becomes more blurred.\n\n[1]Starting in Fall 2024, GMail is disabling access to apps that don't use\nOAuth (such as older IMAP clients which log in using a traditional username\nand password). So you'll no longer have the choice to do it the old fashioned\nway, and I can see more services following suit.\n\n  * oauth\n  * privacy\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\nImprove this question\n\nFollow this question to receive notifications\n\nedited 46 mins ago\n\nGreg Askew\n\n36.8k66 gold badges5555 silver badges8282 bronze badges\n\nasked 1 hour ago\n\nrkagererrkagerer\n\n10144 bronze badges\n\n1\n\n  * This has nothing to do with technology. It's similar to the change that Microsoft made when they switched to modern authentication. You receive a longer lived token from a server to use for authentication rather than authenticating with the application server directly. If you have questions about privacy, contact the vendor .\n\n\u2013 Greg Askew\n\n1 hour ago\n\nAdd a comment |\n\n## 0\n\nReset to default\n\n## You must log in to answer this question.\n\n##\n\nBrowse other questions tagged\n\n  * oauth\n  * privacy\n\n.\n\n  * The Overflow Blog\n  * How do you evaluate an LLM?
