Thoughts appeared on the\nscreen coherently, articulately, and it aimed (or at least tried) to execute\ntasks precisely as instructed. It seemed magical.\n\nHowever, it still required:\n\n  1. Prompting the system\n  2. Absorbing the information\n  3. Taking the next action\n\nHumans are still very much in the loop. A human is necessary for each of these\nsteps, limiting the extent to which we can delegate tasks to AI systems.\n\n## Invisible AI\n\nAn invisible AI is any AI system that takes correct actions without active\nhuman intervention. It eliminates the first step mentioned above, \"Prompting\nthe system.\"\n\nAn invisible AI agent listens to events or information. When triggered, it\nautomatically takes the correct action without human prompting.\n\nThis approach frees up vital mental energy from humans, allowing us to focus\non supervising and managing AI agents.\n\n## Human in the Loop\n\nWe cannot delegate everything to AI.\n\nActions have consequences, and humans must be responsible and accountable for\nthe AI's actions.\n\nInvisible AI involves humans in the loop as the final step.\n\nThe human's responsibility is to confirm or reject the action suggested by the\nAI.\n\nIt is the human preventing incorrect actions and executing the correct ones.\n\n## GabrielAI as Invisible AI\n\nWe designed GabrielAI to be an invisible AI. Our focus is on emails and\ncommunication. GabrielAI assists in managing email inboxes, filters new emails\nand automatically drafts possible responses.\n\nUpon receiving an email, users find a drafted response in their inbox without\ntaking any action. The human's responsibility is to review the draft and send\nit.\n\nThis approach saves users valuable mental energy and time. Users no longer\nneed to manually type and craft entire emails. In most cases, an AI can draft\nan email better than a human, so we let the AI handle it.\n\nThe trade-off is the initial setup required by the user. The user must inform\nGabrielAI of which emails to filter, how to reply to each email, and provide\nall necessary information. However, after this initial setup, GabrielAI\noperates as an invisible AI.\n\n## A Reasonable Compromise\n\nWhile having a human in the loop is ideal, some actions are inconsequential or\nof such low value that they do not require human intervention. In fact, human\nintervention would decrease the value of automation.\n\nEvery system is engineered upon sensible trade-offs.\n\nIn the case of GabrielAI, the system can also organize emails by adding\nlabels. This feature is not overseen by a human; the system automatically adds\nlabels to emails if instructed to do so.\n\n## Not only LLM\n\nIt is important to notice that an invisible AI, does not need to be a LLM.\n\nHowever, those class of AI agents are so useful and mainstream that it makes\nsense to re-surface this topic.\n\nMade with Material for MkDocs\n\n", "frontpage": false}
