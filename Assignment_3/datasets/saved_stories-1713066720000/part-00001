From\nEast to West, storytellers paint them as creatures of fire, of deep waters, of\nthe wilds and the storms, as anthropomorphic, with scales and teeth and\npersonalities that keep guard of treasures. This Lunar New Year of the Dragon\nis the ideal time to deep-dive into East Asian art and culture to trace the\norigins and practices around this mythical being.\n\n### Summary\n\n  * 2024 is the Lunar Year of the Dragon, a token of courage, creativity, wisdom, and strength. The occasion has been observed across East Asia in various degrees.\n  * The Chinese Long is interlaced with ancient Chinese cosmology, philosophy, and politics; its legacy has been kept alive through the Chinese Zodiac and visual arts.\n  * Long is an umbrella term where regional or diasporic expressions are in rich supply. For example, blue/azure dragons gain more visibility in the southeast Chinese mainland and Taiwanese culture, as they mirror the seaside environment and sailing culture there.\n  * Japanese dragons (ry\u016b) that are feared and revered as powerful deities and creators of the mythical universe. Some dragons appear to be living in the water, others stay on the hills, many are depicted as rain-inducing.\n  * Korea\u2019s Goryeosa categorizes a melange of creatures as dragons, with yong being its mature form. In this stage, the dragon governs the sky and regulates the weather. Yong is associated with the royal family and is known for being powerful, friendly, and even humorous.\n\nUtagawa Kuniyoshi, Tamatori Escaping the Dragon King with the Treasure Pearl,\n19th century.\n\n## Year of the Dragon\n\nAs the only mythological creature in the lunar calendars, the dragon holds\nspecial significance. It is a powerful and auspicious zodiac associated with\ncourage, creativity, leadership, wisdom, and strength. Chinese astrology also\ndocuments each lunar year according to a Wuxing (\u4e94\u884c; consisting of Fire,\nWater, Wood, Metal, and Earth) cycle. 2024, for example, is the year of the\nwood dragon. The wood element stands for creative vision and reliability. Once\ncoupled with a powerful zodiac such as the dragon, the year is bound to be a\nyear of growth, reinvention, and opportunities.\n\nCarvings with Chinese Zodiac on the ceiling of the gate, 757, Kushida Shrine,\nFukuoka, Japan.\n\n## Chinese Dragon\u2013Long\n\n### Provenance and Iconographies\n\nSince the earliest archaeological evidence, Chinese dragons, or Longs (\u9f99),\nhave been known as benevolent, wise, and divine. The Chinese Long is the\nworld\u2019s oldest: Tomb excavations from the Yangshao (\u4ef0\u97f6) Village in Henan\nProvince from ca. 5000\u20133000 BCE reveal one of the most ancient Longs as\nelongated and reptile-like. Jade objects from the Neolithic age would feature\niconographies of a \u201cpig dragon (\u732a\u9f99)\u201d with pricked ears. Besides their\nvariegated visual representations, Chinese dragons are considered composite.\nHypotheses associate Long with the neck of a snake, the scales of a carp, the\nnose of a pig, the head of an ox, the whiskers of rat, the goatee of a goat,\nthe horns of a deer, the eyes of a rabbit, the ears of a dog, the claws of a\nhawk, the legs of a horse, the crest of a rooster, the whiskers of a monkey,\nand the paws of a tiger. Drawn from real-life animals, Long has the strengths\nof each but is more potent than all of them.\n\nJade Pig-dragon, BC 3500-BC 3000, National Palace Museum, Taipei, Taiwan.\n\nDragon Chasing Flaming Pearl, 14th century, Yuan dynasty, Metropolitan Museum\nof Art, New York City, NY, USA.\n\n## Jade Pig-dragon\n\nJade objects from the Neolithic age would feature iconographies of a \u201cpig\ngragon (\u732a\u9f99)\u201d with pricked ears.\n\n## Dragon Chasing Flaming Pearl\n\nThe Dragon and the Pearl is one of the most common images associated with the\nChinese dragon. In folklores, the burning pearl foregrounds Longs\u2019 wisdom.\n\n### Dragons and Pearl\n\nThe Dragon and the Pearl is one of the most common images associated with the\nChinese dragon. In folklores, the burning pearl foregrounds Longs\u2019 wisdom. How\nLongs came into contact with the pearl is but a snap from discursive\nnarratives.^ In visual arts, however, Long becomes reduced into a symbol more\nclosely coupled with culture and aesthetics than mythology, that is, the\nimagery of dragons playing with a pearl. The creature would prance and bounce,\nsometimes act as if they are about to swallow that burning orb! Although it\nseems easy to picture the relation between dragons and pearls in a way similar\nto the pearls from an oyster, little evidence shows these pearls are from the\nwater. They are, in fact, \u201cflaming\u201d and \u201cluminary.\u201d Western scholars tend to\ncompare it to the sun, and Longs\u2019 act of swallowing them to the solar or lunar\neclipse. By contrast, Chinese interpretations tend to be more lenient. In\nlocal contexts, the pearl could denote any valuable object that enhances its\nbeholder\u2019s positive qualities.\n\n### Dragons and Water\n\nYet Chinese people do connect Longs to water; ancient philosophies, including\nTaoism, profusely portray dragons alongside it. Long has been a literary image\nassociated with great lakes, rivers, and valleys and ascribed cosmological\nsignificance, as they were believed to influence water circulation.\nFolklorists and anthropologists have been studying the role of dragons in\nrainmaking rituals as harbingers of rain and storms. Terms in the Chinese\nlanguage such as \u201cDragon King (or Dragon God; \u9f99\u738b)\u201d refer to one type of Longs\nthat is considered sovereign of the waters. They govern the four seas (east,\nsouth, west, and north), but myths of smaller Longs could be found near any\nwater bodies. And until now, people hold gatherings and ceremonies in Dragon\n(King) Temples (\u9f99\u738b\u5e99) to worship the Dragon King in their region and pray for\nthe new year.\n\n### Dragons in Everyday Life\n\nFrom folkloric beliefs to philosophical underpinnings, the Chinese dragons\nhave been created by the people, serving elites and commoners alike. As early\nas the Shang (\u5546) dynasty, they became a popular motif for bronze and jade\nobjects. Moving onward, Chinese dragons further blended into secular practices\nby displaying specific patterns in their designs, which led to some\nclassifying Chinese dragons based on their colors. Blue dragons (\u9752\u9f99, \u82cd\u9f99), for\ninstance, can represent water. Green dragons symbolize growth, vegetation, and\nforests. Black dragons represent winter, as well as the hidden and mystical.\nHowever, what color should be used is dependent on the historical era an\nartwork is made, as well as regional customs. For example, white traditionally\nsignifies death. Thus, any Longs presented in funerary contexts should also be\nwhite. On the other hand, for those who want to get off to a good start for\nthe 2024 Chinese New Year of the Dragon, red should be best.\n\n### Imperial Dragons\n\nPopular culture today seems to frequently tie Long to imperial power. This has\nsome basis in history since \u201cthe true descendent of the dragon (\u771f\u9f99\u5929\u5b50)\u201d is a\nphrase on the Chinese emperor dating back to the Han (\u6c49) dynasty. Up to the\nQing dynasty, the said metaphor had been reinforced to validate a lineage\nbetween Long and the ruling emperors and further explain what dragon-related\nvisuals should be used in what setting: for jewelry, architecture, clothing,\nand more. Based on the dragon robe (\u9f99\u888d), or the emperor\u2019s formal attire from\nprevious dynasties, the Qing Empire affirmed the regulations on the number of\nclaws in dragons that emperors and their descendants should wear and use since\nYuan (\u5143) China. Once again, the five-claw dragon (\u4e94\u722a\u9f99) was deemed of the\nhighest hierarchy that corresponded to the Qing emperor, whereas dragons below\nthat have four or fewer claws.\n\nFestival Robe, 2nd half of the 18th century, Qing dynasty, Metropolitan Museum\nof Art, New York City, NY, USA.\n\n## Long Beyond Mainland China\n\nAround the 1960s, it occurred to the West that the collective once labeled as\nChinese might have stretched beyond the Chinese mainland. The reminder came in\nthe form of an economic surge in four regions\u2013South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan,\nand Hong Kong\u2013collectively called \u201cthe Four Little Asian Dragons\u201d or \u201cthe Four\nAsian Tigers.\u201d^ Also uncovered in the wake of the booming trade and commerce\nwas a rich tradition influenced by coastal environments and mercantile\npractices, with Long as a shared totem at the heart of it. For the Chinese-\nspeaking people residing in those regions during the decades, a culture\nrevolving around a symbolic \u201cLong\u201d was taking shape and strengthening their\nbonds to a collective commonly referred to as the descendants of the dragon\n(\u9f99\u7684\u4f20\u4eba).\n\nBlue/azure dragons gain more visibility in the southeast Chinese mainland and\nTaiwanese culture, as they mirror the seaside environment and sailing culture\nthere. Early spring blue dragon festivities, including the Zhonghe Festival\n(or Longtaitou; \u4e2d\u548c\u7bc0/\u9f8d\u62ac\u982d) and the Dragon King worship, were introduced to\nLukang (\u9e7f\u6e2f\u93ae), Taiwan from the southern Chinese mainland between the Ming and\nQing dynasties. Although many of the powers previously attributed to the blue\ndragon, ruler of the East Sea, and other Dragon Kings have been delegated to\nother deities, who now have shrines outside major Dragon Temples, the\nTaiwanese Long remain in close relation with the humid subtropical climate.^\nLocals still turn to Longs with offerings and the hopes that the deities could\nprotect the crops and the people from pests and humid weather. The wooden\ndragon statue in the Lotus Pond in Kaohsiung (\u9ad8\u96c4\u5e02) is a tourist and religious\nsite revolving around this worship.\n\nDragon and Tiger Pagodas, 1976, Lotus Pond, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.

But it is\ncelebrated locally with a Japanese version of the twelve zodiac signs. Nihon\nno ry\u016b (referred to as tatsu in the Japanese Zodiac;\u65e5\u672c\u306e\u7adc/\u9f8d) encompass a\nspectrum of Japanese dragons that are feared and revered. Meanwhile, Japanese\ndragons, or (more commonly) ry\u016b, are remembered as legendary figures in myths,\nlegends, and artistic productions. As powerful deities and creators of the\nmythical universe, documentations claim they eventually gave birth to the\nfirst emperor.\n\nThe earliest documentation of ry\u016b comes from Kojiki (\u53e4\u4e8b\u8a18), a chronicle of\nancient Japanese myths, ceremonies, and emperors from ca. 680 AD\u2013as progeny of\ndragons. Some dragons appear to be living in the water; Ry\u016bjin (\u9f8d\u795e), the\nDragon King, is said to rule the great seas. Others stay on the hills, like\nthe great serpent Hachidai-ry\u016b\u014d (\u516b\u5927\u9f8d\u738b).^ Moreover, many ry\u016b are depicted as\nrain-inducing. Apart from Ry\u016bjin, the chief rain and water god, Kojiki also\nmentions another dragon called Kuraokami (\u95c7\u9f97). The name roughly translates as\n\u201cgod of rain and snow.\u201d These are some examples of how dragons, based on\nlegends, defined the Japanese weather phenomenon.\n\n### The Great Waves\n\nBased on existing ukiyo-e, artists tend to incorporate images of ocean waves\nand waterfalls when ry\u016b is their subject matter, which implies a special\nconnection between ry\u016b and water, or, more specifically, the ocean.^ But other\nthan examining it from economic structures or lifestyles, it is arguable that\nthe same artistic choice was made at the service of iconographic traditions\nand storytelling.\n\nWhile they are able to fly, ry\u016b is hardly ever considered one of the \u201cflying\ndragons.\u201d Instead, it often appears wingless. Some of its features resemble\nthat of a snake. Katsushika Hokusai, the artist behind Under the Wave off\nKanagawa, offered his approach. The webbed feet and a \u201cvignette\u201d of waves\ncontain their subjects in a playful manner. Both elements situate ry\u016b right\nnext to the ocean and subtly reveal via a symbolic language the former\u2019s\nnature. The detailed line art makes evident another visual element that is\ntypical of ry\u016b. As this dragon curls and stares at the viewer, its talons\nextend, and each has three claws. Despite the fact that three-claw dragons\nwere less prominent in older times, Japan would make it a new standard for its\nart.\n\nUtagawa Kuniyoshi viewed the same subject from a different perspective.\nKuniyoshi engaged with a motif of the ocean from the narratives qua\nnarratives. These involve legends about tide jewels, which writings refer to\nas treasures that could control the ebbs and flows that the Dragon Gods\npossessed and the less-godly ones coveted. One story related to this imagery\nis about Princess Tamatori, an ama (\u6d77\u5973; female pearl diver) on a mission to\nretrieve the jewel stolen by the Dragon King from a ship sent by the Tang\ndynasty emperor. The waves are necessary for setting the scene as Tamatori is\nchased by the shoal of sea creatures about to seize the treasure from her.\nTidal waves give shape to the turbulence, which stands for both the fury from\nbeneath the sea caused by the pearl and the Dragon, as well as the inner\nstruggle and sacrifice Tamatori would have to go through during the journey. A\nDragon King lurks in the top right section, showing that the jewel was not\ninherent but used by him as an extension of his power.\n\nKatsushika Hokusai, Matsuri Yatai Dragon, 1844, Hokusai Museum, Obuse, Japan.\n\nUtagawa Kuniyoshi, Recovering the Stolen Jewel from the Palace of the Dragon\nKing, 1853, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City, NY, USA.\n\n## Matsuri Yatai Dragon\n\nAs this dragon curls and stares at the viewer, its talons extend, and each has\nthree claws. Despite the fact that three-claw dragons were less prominent in\nolder times, Japan would make it a new standard for its art.\n\n## Recovering the Stolen Jewel from the Palace of the Dragon King\n\nThis print depicts Princess Tamatori, an ama (\u6d77\u5973; female pearl diver) on a\nmission to retrieve the jewel stolen by the Dragon King from a ship sent by\nthe Tang dynasty emperor.\n\nTidal waves give shape to the turbulence, which stands for both the fury from\nbeneath the sea caused by the pearl and the Dragon, as well as the inner\nstruggle and sacrifice Tamatori would have to go through during the journey. A\nDragon King lurks in the top right section, showing that the jewel was not\ninherent but used by him as an extension of his power.\n\n## Korean Dragon\u2013Yong\n\n### Genealogies Between East and West\n\nKorean mythology compiled in Goryeosa (\uace0\ub824\uc0ac), or the history of the Goryeo\ndynasty, features a spectrum of dragons. According to the document, Imugis\n(\uc774\ubb34\uae30) are where dragons started. This less-than-dragon form is considered part\nof the reptiles and will aspire to be a full-fledged flying dragon or\nyong/ryong (\uc6a9/\ub8e1). The formative aspect is a trait underscored among Korean\ndragons. The trope this trait entails, that dragons represent a transcendental\nend, finds resonance across East Asia and beyond. On top of it, theories\nposition Korean yong between Eastern and Western cultures due to its\nadaptation of European and Chinese elements.\n\nArchaeological finds in question include the \u201cchicken-dragon\u201d (gyeryong) in\nSamguk yusa ( \uc0bc\uad6d\uc720\uc0ac; Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms). It allegedly has\nfeatures similar to the European basilisk (or cockatrice) and is the origin of\nthe name Gyeryong Province, as well as that of Gyeryongsan (\u9dc4\u9f8d\u5c71), the latter\nhas a ridge shaped like the spine of a dragon with a chicken crest on it and\ntranslates to \u201cthe Mount of the Chicken-Dragon.\u201d For the Korean yong, the\nmountain might not be a far-fetched analogy because the creature, typically\nwith four claws, is known for being gargantuan and living in close proximity\nto the sky and water, often accompanied by clouds.\n\n### Communications and Comparative Engagement\n\nYong is a symbol of the Korean Empire. The royal family used it to justify\nthemselves as governors, as much as they valued its auspicious implications\nand characteristics of strength, wisdom, and divinity. Thus, yong are also\nprevalent in imperial palaces and objects, from attires to furniture and\narchitectural designs. The dragon\u2019s growth corresponds well with that of the\nemperor, who might reference yong to explain how the weather changed and,\nconsequently, seek its aid for betterment.\n\nFor thousands of years, the Korean dragon is believed to have coexisted with\nKorea and witnessed the rise and fall of its kingdoms. They were heavily\nfeatured in the late-Goguryeo periods, as inferred from the tomb walls. One of\nthem is in the Tonggu Sasinchong (\u901a\u6e9d\u56db\u795e\u585a, Four Directional Deities Tomb in\nTonggu). Among the mural paintings, there is an Azure Dragon. The figure is on\nthe east wall, side-by-side with the other three deities: the White Tiger on\nthe west, the Vermilion Bird on the south, and the Black Tortoise-and-Serpent\n(intertwined snake and tortoise) on the north. The sinuous and supple motifs\nthat convey its shape and movements drew influences from Taoism and were\nexecuted to the minutest detail with local artistry.\n\nAs Korea has been engaging with the global art and cultural world more than\never before, contributions from academies and artists also remind us of the\ntypological difference between Eastern and Western lore about \u201cdragons.\u201d For\nthe West, dragons are often malicious creatures for heroes to conquer and\nslay. East Asians, on the other hand, cast the \u201cdragons\u201d in separate cultural\ncontexts and endow them with more positive character traits. As a result, an\nimmortal, benevolent, yet protective creature was born, partly out of the\ncoastal living some inhabitants were used to, partly as an offshoot of the\nestablished agrarian or fishing culture across the shores and the inland\nregions.\n\nAdditionally, it is also worthy of note that, particularly in the Korean\nregions, the image of yong has experienced some transformations due to recent\ninfluences from abroad and changing public opinions regarding traditions.\nKorean popular culture has shifted from perceiving yong as the divine,\nbenevolent, and unfathomable to bracketing them with other supernatural beings\nable to wield superpowers. Most of the time, these creatures appear as\nfriendly but monstrous neighbors with a touch of humor.\n\nAzure Dragon, 37 BCE-668 CE, Tonggu Sasinchong, Ji\u2019an, North Korea.\n\n## Closing Remarks\n\nThese are just fragments that, hopefully, help understand how \u201cdragons\u201d were\nintertwined with East Asian history. In short, Long, ry\u016b, yong, and many more\nexpressions used in that part of the continent and beyond are identity\nshaping; they contribute to systems and branches of mythology, with art\ncapturing parts of it. But among all those similarities and differences in\nvisual forms, expressions and notions embedded in that mythical creature\nshowcase how people from different ethnicities and cultural backgrounds could\nbe united together, either through a totem-like symbol or through an imagined\ncollective, or else through the act (and art) of celebrating.\n\nHappy Year of the Dragon!\n\n## Bibliography\n\n1.\n\nMichael Ashkenazi, Handbook of Japanese Mythology, Oxford: ABC Clio, 2003.\n\n2.\n\nAdrienne Barbanson, Fables in Ivory: Japanese netsuke and their Legends,\nLondon: Mark Paterson & Co.
