This is surprisingly common behavior for software\ndevelopers. Some of us spend the entire work week coding for a company, then\nchoose to continue coding as a hobby in our mornings, evenings, and weekends.\nI plan my work around my two-and-a-half-year-old daughter\u2019s sleep schedule.\n\nAt the beginning of the project, I often imagined a voice asking nervous \u201cwhy\u201d\nquestions. Why build a text editor when other ones already exist? Why work on\nsomething that you will never get paid for? What if the long-term maintenance\nof the project eventually leads to burnout? Aren\u2019t there more important\nproblems you could be working on?\n\nThen, I started watching Adam Savage building stuff.\n\nFor several years, but especially since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic,\nAdam Savage has been live-streaming from his workshop in San Francisco. I\u2019ve\nwatched him build cabinets, doors, movie prop replicas, clothing, and tools.\nHe seems to enjoy both the process of learning and applying new skills, as\nwell as the joy of creating something that exactly fits his workflow and\naesthetic.\n\nSo I would imagine asking Adam Savage the \u201cwhy\u201d questions that were bothering\nme. And the questions seemed so ridiculous that I had to laugh. Would Adam\nSavage stop building that lighsaber replica because other people have done it\nbefore, and he could just buy one online instead? Does he worry that spending\nhours building a miniature chop saw won\u2019t meaningfully advance his career?\n\nI\u2019m building my side project simply because I want it to exist. I want to\nunderstand everything about how it works, down to the last detail. And someday\nI hope to share it with people that will get why it\u2019s awesome.\n\nIsn\u2019t that enough?\n\n", "frontpage": false}
