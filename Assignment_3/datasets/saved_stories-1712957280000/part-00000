This typeface is the practical result of the Primarium research\nproject [www.primarium.info] which studies handwriting instruction\nmethodologies around the world. Its findings with regards to the calligraphic\nmodels currently in use, their development and rationale, informed the design\nof the Playwrite glyphs.\n\nThe shape of the handwritten Latin alphabethas developed following different\ncurrents, trends and colonial influences around the world. As a result, the\nvery notion of what constitutes primary school cursive writing varies\ndramatically. It could be vertical or slanted, fully joined or semi-joined,\nuppercase letters can be ornate and decorative or simply borrowed from print\nstyles, lowercase letters can be based on round or oval foundational shapes,\nand the proportion of the x-height vis-a-vis the ascenders and descenders can\ndiffer.\n\n## Build instructions\n\nFor complete build instructions refer to /sources/build-models-HowTo-README.md\n\n## Letter variations\n\nBased on the Primarium study the TypeTogether team isolated a limited number\nof structural variations for the Latin letter shapes: 8 variation styles for\nlower cases and three for uppercases. With the help of a sturdy contextual\nalternate (CALT) opentype code these different veriation groups can be\nseamlessly combined.\n\n  * Precursive. Default set of lower case letters. These are completely unjoined.\n\n  * Modern cursive. Same design as precursive in isolated shape but it istriggers a semi-connected typesetting. Uses .mod suffix (eg. n.mod).\n\n  * Fully joined odern cursive. Adds loops to descenders and connecting strokes to letters that do not connect in .mod. Uses .jmc suffix (eg. g.jmc).\n\n  * Full Cursive. Construction os several glyphs change to match a continuous cursive style. Uses .ful suffix (eg. s.ful).\n\n  * Speed loops. Adds speedloops to most letters with ascender strokes. Uses .lop suffix (eg. h.lop).\n\n  * Curved entry stroke. Changes the lead-in connection at x-heigh level for several letters. Uses .cnt suffix (eg. n.cnt).\n\n  * Mirrored loops. Adds loops in to two letters and switches loop direction in \u201cf\u201d. Uses .mrr suffix (eg. f.mrr).\n\n  * Microloops. Adds knots or small loops to mark stroke direction change in some letters. Uses .mlp suffix (eg. o.mlp).\n\n  * Print. Default set of upper case letters. These are completely unjoined.\n\n  * Cursive upper cases. Cursive capitals. SAlso enable connection with a number of lowercase letters Uses .cur suffix (eg. A.cur).\n\n  * Decorative upper cases. Secondary set of decorative capitals to match certain handwriting models. These are semi-connected. Uses .dec suffix (eg. G.dec).\n\n  * Regional variants lower cases. Alternative designs necessary for one or more specific regions. These use suffix locl when used in several fonts or locl_XX where XX is a two letter country code. (eg. Q.dec_pt).\n\n  * Regional variants upper cases.\n\n## Design variation axes\n\nPlaywrite's design space spans over four variation axes: the slant of the\nletters, ascender and descender length, typographic color, and a stroke speed\naxes that controls the tension of the curves and the direction and connection\nof the strokes.\n\nWeight axis wght Min: 100 Max: 400\n\nSlant axis. slnt Min: 0 Max: 18\n\nSpeed axis SPED Min: 0 Max: 100\n\nExtension axis. YEXT Min: 375 Max: 1000\n\n## Country recipes\n\nRecipes for regional models of the Playwrite font arecreated by recipes that\nreside on a CSV file Playwrite/sources/data/models-all.csv. Each row of the\nfile contains the data that names the font model, specifies a location in\nthree of the founr axes (the weight axis always remains variable), and\ncontains a selection of the of the letter variants that are preferred in that\nregion.\n\nStructure of each row is as follows: Country;lang_tag;slnt;EXTD;SPED;UC;lc\n\nThe classes UC and lc must contain the exact number of glyphs that is expected\nin the substitution classes, and in the correct order: @UC = [A B C D E F G H\nI J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z AE Eth IJ Eng OE Thorn Germandbls];\n\n@lc = [a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z ae eth ij eng oe\nthorn germandbls idotless jdotless];\n\nHere is an example of the recipe used for the Canada Playwrite Font:\nCanada;CAN;18;496;100;A.cur_locl B.dec C.cur D.dec E.cur F.dec G.dec H.dec\nI.cur J.cur K.dec L.dec M.cur N.cur O.dec P.dec Q.cur R.dec S.cur T.dec U.cur\nV.cur W.cur X.cur Y.cur Z.cur AE.cur Eth IJ.cur Eng OE.cur Thorn\nGermandbls;a.mod b.lop c.mod d.mod e.ful f.mrr g.jmc h.lop i.mod j.jmc k.lop\nl.lop m.cnt n.cnt o.mod p.mrr_ca q.mrr r.ful s.ful t.mod u.mod v.cnt w.cnt\nx.ful y.cnt z.cnt ae.ful eth.mod ij.jmc eng oe.ful thorn.jmc germandbls.jmc\nidotless.mod jdotless.jmc\n\n## List of fonts by region\n\nCountry| Tag| Variant| Family name  \n---|---|---|---  \nArgentina| ARG| Playwrite ARG  \nAustralia| AUS| NSW| Playwrite AUS NSW  \nAustralia| AUS| QLD| Playwrite AUS QLD  \nAustralia| AUS| SA| Playwrite AUS SA  \nAustralia| AUS| TAS| Playwrite AUS TAS  \nAustralia| AUS| VIC| Playwrite AUS VIC  \nBelgium| BEL| WAL| Playwrite BEL WAL  \nBelgium| BEL| VLG| Playwrite BEL VLG  \nBrazil| BRA| Playwrite BRA  \nCanada| CAN| Playwrite CAN  \nChile| CHI| Playwrite CHI  \nColombia| COL| Playwrite COL  \nCroatia| HRV| Playwrite HRV  \nCroatia| HRV| Left Hand| Playwrite HRV Left Hand  \nCuba| CUB| Playwrite CUB  \nCzech Republic| CZE| Playwrite CZE  \nSlovakia| SVK| Playwrite SVK  \nDenmark| DNK| Looped| Playwrite DNK Looped  \nDenmark| DNK| Unlooped| Playwrite DNK Unlooped  \nEngland| ENG| Semi Joined| Playwrite ENG Semi Joined  \nEngland| ENG| Joined| Playwrite ENG Joined  \nFinland| FIN| Playwrite FIN  \nFrance| FRA| Traditional| Playwrite FRA Traditional  \nFrance| FRA| Modern| Playwrite FRA Modern  \nGermany| DEU| Grundschrift| Playwrite DEU Grundschrift  \nGermany| DEU| LA| Playwrite DEU LA  \nGermany| DEU| SAS| Playwrite DEU SAS  \nGermany| DEU| VA| Playwrite DEU VA  \nIceland| ISL| Playwrite ISL  \nIndonesia| IDN| Playwrite IDN  \nIreland| IRL| Playwrite IRL  \nItaly| ITA| Traditional| Playwrite ITA Traditional  \nItaly| ITA| Modern| Playwrite ITA Modern  \nMexico| MEX| Playwrite MEX  \nNetherlands| NLD| Playwrite NLD  \nNew Zealand| NZL| Playwrite NZL  \nNorway| NOR| Playwrite NOR  \nPeru| PER| Playwrite PER  \nPoland| POL| Playwrite POL  \nPortugal| PRT| Playwrite PRT  \nSlovakia| SVK| Playwrite SVK  \nSouth Africa| ZAF| Playwrite ZAF  \nSpain| ESP| Playwrite ESP  \nSpain| ESP| Ornate Caps| Playwrite ESP Ornate Caps  \nSweden| SWE| Playwrite SWE  \nTurkey| TUR| Playwrite TUR  \nUSA| USA| Modern| Playwrite USA Modern  \nUSA| USA| Traditional| Playwrite USA Traditional  \nVietnam| VNM| Playwrite VNM  \n  \n## Create or edit handwriting models\n\nAfter creating or editing glyphs and modifying the Recipe table you will need\nto prepare the files for font generation following these four steps.\n\n  1. Write the model dictionary\n  2. Write the feature file for models\n  3. Update the design space\n  4. Create UFOs from the Glyphpackage file\n\nNow you are ready to build new fonts following the build instructions:\n/sources/build-models-HowTo-README.md\n\n## About\n\nSensei primary repository.\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\n### License\n\nOFL-1.1 license\n\nActivity\n\n### Stars\n\n8 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n8 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n0 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases\n\nNo releases published\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Contributors 3\n\n  * josescaglione\n  * casasin Joancarles Casasin\n  * TypeTogether TypeTogether\n\n## Languages\n\n  * Shell 100.0%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
