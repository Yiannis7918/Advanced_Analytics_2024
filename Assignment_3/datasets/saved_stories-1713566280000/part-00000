To receive new posts and\nsupport my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.\n\nThey hated doing them.\n\nSo we stopped.\n\nThen, their homework caught up to their level, and they struggled with\nproblems that required extensive multiplications (think a 5-digit number times\na 4-digit number).\n\nWe brought out the flashcards again.\n\nWhich they continued to hate.\n\nWe worried that they were going to continue struggling.\n\nGiven it was an often fractious encounter, we decided that perhaps they would\nlearn them after having to skip-count seventy billion times for each problem\nthey were doing.\n\nSo we let it go.\n\nThey eventually learned their multiplication tables.\n\n###\n\nHelping students to better regulate their learning through the use of\neffective learning techniques\n\nIn 2013, John Dunlosky, Katherine A. Rawson, Elizabeth J. Marsh, Mitchell J.\nNathan, and Daniel T. Willingham wrote a research article titled: \u201cImproving\nStudents\u2019 Learning With Effective Learning Techniques: Promising Directions\nFrom Cognitive and Educational Psychology.\u201d\n\nYou can find the paper here:\nhttps://journals.sagepub.com/stoken/rbtfl/Z10jaVH/60XQM/full\n\nThe paper covers:\n\n> In this monograph, we discuss 10 learning techniques in detail and offer\n> recommendations about their relative utility. We selected techniques that\n> were expected to be relatively easy to use and hence could be adopted by\n> many students. Also, some techniques (e.g., highlighting and rereading) were\n> selected because students report relying heavily on them, which makes it\n> especially important to examine how well they work. The techniques include\n> elaborative interrogation, self-explanation, summarization, highlighting (or\n> underlining), the keyword mnemonic, imagery use for text learning,\n> rereading, practice testing, distributed practice, and interleaved practice.\n\nThe methodology of each technique is covered in the paper as follows:\n\n> In particular, each review is divided into the following sections:\n>\n>   1. General description of the technique and why it should work\n>\n>\n\n>   2. How general are the effects of this technique?\n>\n>     1. Learning conditions\n>\n>     2. Student characteristics\n>\n>     3. Materials\n>\n>     4. Criterion tasks\n>\n>   3. Effects in representative educational contexts\n>\n>   4. Issues for implementation\n>\n>   5. Overall assessment\n>\n>\n\n>\n> The review for each technique can be read independently of the others, and\n> particular variables of interest can be easily compared across techniques.\n\nThe PDF is 58 pages (including the References).\n\nThe findings are roughly broken down as follows:\n\nHigh Effectiveness\n\n  * Distribute Practice - setting a practice schedule spread out over time.\n\n  * Practice Testing - taking tests (self-administered work as well) over the material\n\nModerate Effectiveness\n\n  * Elaborative Interrogation - creating a statement for why the material is true\n\n  * Interleaved Practice - setting a schedule (during a single study session) for practicing different parts of the material or different problem types of the materials\n\n  * Self-explanation - explaining how the new information connects to information that is already known and/or explaining steps in a multi-step problem\n\nLow Effectiveness\n\n  * Highlighting - coloring parts of the material while reading\n\n  * Imagery use for text learning - creating mental images of text materials\n\n  * Re-reading - doing multiple reads of the same material\n\n  * Summarization - writing summaries (length didn\u2019t matter) of material\n\n  * The keyword mnemonic - inventing interactive mental imagery to group new material with already known (striking) visual things.\n\n###\n\nThe research takeaway - testing and distributed practice\n\nThe takeaway from the paper (which you should read at some point because it\u2019s\nwonderful and goes into so many details about how they tested these things and\nwhat prior research had been done) is that the most effective way to study is\nto do testing and distribute practice.\n\nOkay, that\u2019s good.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\n> Note that we use the term practice testing here (a) to distinguish testing\n> that is completed as a low-stakes or no-stakes practice or learning activity\n> outside of class from summative assessments that are administered by an\n> instructor in class, and (b) to encompass any form of practice testing that\n> students would be able to engage in on their own\n\nand\n\n> The term distributed- practice effect refers to the finding that\n> distributing learning over time (either within a single study session or\n> across sessions) typically benefits long-term retention more than does\n> massing learning opportunities back-to-back or in relatively close\n> succession.\n\n###\n\nWhy not both?\n\nIf both are highly effective, then doing both should be even more effective.\n\nRight?\n\nRight?\n\nWell, yes, with an asterisk.\n\nCognitive psychologist Thomas Toppino, who chairs the Department of\nPsychological and Brain Sciences at Villanova University, was interviewed for\na segment on KQED-FM (San Francisco NPR station)1, where he shared:\n\n> Never test yourself immediately after you study. You\u2019re going to grossly\n> overestimate how well you know the information if you test yourself right\n> away.\n\nWhat he and other researchers recommend in their 2016 paper2, Relearn Faster\nand Retain Longer: Along With Practice, Sleep Makes Perfect, is\n\n> We found that interleaving sleep between learning sessions not only reduced\n> the amount of practice needed by half but also ensured much better long-term\n> retention. Sleeping after learning is definitely a good strategy, but\n> sleeping between two learning sessions is a better strategy.\n\nSo what the students should be doing is distributed practice and testing WHILE\nsleeping in between the distributed practices.\n\n###\n\nYou just invented homework.\n\nHow about that?!\n\nWe want the student to do a \u201clow-stakes or no-stakes practice or learning\nactivity outside of class from summative assessments that are administered by\nan instructor in class, and (b) to encompass any form of practice testing that\nstudents would be able to engage in on their own.\u201d\n\nWe want the student to do it in a spaced fashion.\n\nWe want the student to sleep in between.\n\nYou just invented homework.\n\nSeriously, though, that\u2019s neat.\n\nBut the way the schools usually do it is that the homework gets turned in, and\nthen days (weeks?!) later, it is returned with marks on the paper of what the\nstudent got wrong.\n\nWhich my kids may look at? I look at it but I\u2019m not sure they do.\n\nWhat\u2019s missing is a more immediate feedback loop.\n\n###\n\nHomework with self-reflection\n\nA simple self-reflection strategy can work wonders while the kid does homework\n(or outside-of-school work).\n\nHave the student self-reflect (or you ask them) - what took a long time?\n\nThat\u2019s what they need to work on.\n\nIt was the 7 and 8 times tables for one of our kids.\n\nWe didn\u2019t need to create extra practice / work for ourselves.\n\nAll we had to do was do the daily homework and ask them what they were\nstruggling with.\n\nIf you work with your kid one-on-one, you won\u2019t even have to ask them, as\nit\u2019ll be (painfully) obvious when they encounter material that hasn\u2019t been\nmastered.\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t believe the mental gymnastics involved in multiplying 7 times 8.\nIt was frequently 6 * 6 = 36, then add a 6, a 7, and another 7\u2014all in their\nheads.\n\n(Think of it geometrically: 6 rows of 6 unit columns - add another column of\n6, so you have 6 rows of 7 unit columns; then you add a row of 7, so you have\n7 rows of 7 unit columns, and then you add a final row of 7 so you have 8 rows\nof 7 unit columns)\n\nIt seemed much easier to know that 7 * 8 is 56 rather than doing the above\nprocess in your head.\n\n###\n\nConclusion - make every homework a test\n\nWe get back to the title of this piece.\n\nThe key is to make every homework a low-stakes test.\n\nThe way homework works in the US is that the teacher goes over the material\nand then the homework is a way to explore the material further and to practice\nthe problems.\n\nSince homework is done at home and the teacher is at school (unless\nhomeschooling or doing outside-of-school work), there is a space of time\nbetween having seen the material and doing the \u201ctest.\u201d\n\nWith some self-reflection, the kid can figure out what stuck and didn\u2019t.\n\nThen, when they do the next homework (which should build on previous\nhomework), it\u2019ll be evident if they remember the past material and what still\nneeds to be mastered.\n\nTry it out and let me know how it goes :)\n\nThat\u2019s all for today :) For more Kids Who Love Math treats, check out our\narchives.\n\nStay Mathy!\n\nAll the best, Sebastian Gutierrez\n\n1\n\nhttps://www.kqed.org/mindshift/49750/a-better-way-to-study-through-self-\ntesting-and-distributed-practice\n\n2\n\nMazza, S., Gerbier, E., Gustin, M.-P., Kasikci, Z., Koenig, O., Toppino, T.\nC., & Magnin, M.
