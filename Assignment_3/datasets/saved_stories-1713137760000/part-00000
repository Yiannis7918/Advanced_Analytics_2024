The genre\nbecame popular in South Korea in the early 2010s, and has become a global\ntrend since the mid-2010s. Varieties of foods ranging from pizza to noodles\nare consumed in front of a camera. The purpose of mukbang is also sometimes\neducational, introducing viewers to regional specialties or gourmet spots.^[1]\n\nA mukbang may be either prerecorded or streamed live through a webcast on\nmultiple streaming platforms such as AfreecaTV, YouTube, TikTok, and Twitch.\nIn the live version, the mukbang host chats with the audience while the\naudience types in real time in the live chat-room. Eating shows are expanding\ntheir influence on internet broadcasting platforms and serve as virtual\ncommunities and as venues for active communication among internet\nusers.^[2]^[3]^[4]^[5]\n\nMukbangers from many different countries have gained considerable popularity\non numerous social websites and have established the mukbang as a possible\nviable alternative career path with a potential to earn a high income for\nyoung South Koreans. By cooking and eating food on camera for a large\naudience, mukbangers generate income from advertising, sponsorships and\nendorsements, as well as viewers' support.^[6] However, there has been growing\ncriticism of mukbang's promotion of unhealthy eating habits, particularly\neating disorders, animal cruelty and food waste.^[7]^[8]^[9]\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\nThe word mukbang (\uba39\ubc29; meokbang) is a portmanteau of the Korean words for\n\"eating\" (\uba39\ub294; mugneun) and \"broadcast/show\" (\ubc29\uc1a1; bangsong).^[4] It would thus\nbe morphologically comparable to \"eatcast\" or \"eatshow\".\n\n## Historical background and origins[edit]\n\nPrior to the 21st century, Korea had traditionally had a food culture based on\nhealthy eating practices and strict Confucian etiquette.^[10] However, a new\nfood culture since the late 2000s has emerged in South Korea characterized by\ninternet eating culture (mukbang). It was first introduced on the real-time\ninternet TV service AfreecaTV in 2009, it now has become a trend in cable\nchannels as well as terrestrial broadcasting. This form of programming\nemphasizes the attractiveness of the person who prepares the food. Eating and\ncooking shows are becoming effective programs for broadcasting companies as\nproduction costs are lower than reality entertainment programs.^[11]\n\nAcademics have also attributed the origins of mukbang in South Korea as being\na part of widespread anxiety, loneliness and unhappiness in many South Koreans\nwith their hypercapitalist country's socioeconomic situation and society,\nwhich they deem as \"hellish\" and \"hopeless\", known as Hell Joseon (\ud5ec\uc870\uc120).^[12]\nConsequently, mukbang gives them an opportunity to relieve some of these\nstressors.^[12]\n\nIn each broadcast, a host will interact with their viewers through online chat\nrooms. Many hosts generate revenue through mukbang by accepting donations or\npartnering with advertising networks.^[4] The popularity of mukbang streams\nhas spread outside of Korea, with online streamers doing their own mukbang\nstreams in other countries.^[13] In 2016, Twitch introduced new categories\nlike \"social eating\" to spotlight them.^[14]^[15]\n\nArticles about mukbang have also appeared in The Huffington Post and The Wall\nStreet Journal.^[16] The Korean word for eating show, \"mukbang,\" has been\nwidely adopted in other types of eating shows, such as those featuring ASMR on\nplatforms such as YouTube.^[17] This eating performance from South Korea has\nalso rapidly spread in influence and popularity to other Asian countries, such\nas Japan and China. In China, mukbang is called \"Chibo\"; hosts make their\ncontent into short videos and vlogs and upload them onto social media\nplatforms like Weibo.^[18]\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\nMukbang emerged from a solo-eating population in South Korea, that found\nentertainment in watching actors and actresses eating in TV shows and\nmovies.^[1] The contrast to the traditional eating culture that revolves\naround eating from the same communal dishes at the family dinner table has\nbeen acknowledged.^[1]\n\nIt has been suggested one can vicariously satisfy the desire for food by\nviewing.^[19] In Korea, individuals who stream mukbang are called broadcast\njockeys (BJs).^[20] As a result, high level of interaction BJ-to-viewer and\nviewer-to-viewer contributes to the sociability aspect of producing and\nconsuming mukbang content.^[20] For example, during broadcast jockey\nChanghyun's interaction with his audience he temporarily paused to follow a\nfan's directions on what to eat next and how to eat it.^[20] Viewers may\ninfluence the direction of the stream but the BJ retains control over what he\nor she eats.^[20] Ventriloquism, by which BJs mime the actions of their fans\nby directing food to the camera in a feeding motion and eating in their stead,\nis another technique that creates the illusion of a shared experience in one\nroom.^[20]\n\nA study conducted by Seoul National University found that within a two-year\ntime frame (April 2017 to April 2019) the term \"mukbang\" was used in over\n100,000 videos from YouTube. It reported that alleviating the feelings of\nloneliness associated with eating alone may be the primary reason for\nmukbang's popularity.^[21] In a pilot study from February 2022 on mukbang\nwatching and mental health, psychologists lay the foundation for future\ninvestigation into the potential detriments of using mukbang, or virtual\neating, as a substitute for social experiences.^[22] Another reason for\nmukbang viewing could be its potential sexual appeal. Researchers have argued\nthat mukbangs can be viewed to satisfy eating-related fetishes, and have\ncommented on the sexualized gaze brought about by watching hosts in such a\nprivate and intimate state.^[7]\n\nMukbang has also been described as a multi-sensory experience and compared to\na similar carnal video type, pornography. It has been proposed that strict\nregulation on pornography and sexual material in Korea could be a contributing\nfactor to the popularity of mukbang. Researchers liken the reduced\nsatisfaction of eating from fervid viewership of mukbang to the diminished\nsatisfaction of sex from overconsumption of pornography.^[1] Other studies\nargue that individuals who watch mukbang do so for entertainment, as an escape\nfrom reality, or to get satisfaction from the ASMR aspects of mukbang such as\nthe eating sounds and sensations.^[7]^[21]^[23]^[24] Watching Mukbang videos\noften creates an parasocial interaction between the mukbanger and the viewer,\nand it could also increase the likelihood of solo-dining of viewers.^[25]\n\n## Varieties[edit]\n\nA popular sub-genre of the trend is \"cook-bang\" (\ucfe1\ubc29) show, in which the\nstreamer includes the preparation and cooking of the dishes featured as part\nof the show.^[26]\n\nSouth Korean video game players have sometimes broadcast mukbang as breaks\nduring their overall streams. The popularity of this practice among local\nusers led the video game streaming service Twitch to begin trialing a\ndedicated \"social eating\" category in July 2016; a representative of the\nservice stated that this category is not necessarily specific to mukbang, but\nwould leave the concept open to interpretation by streamers within its\nguidelines.^[27]\n\n## Monetization[edit]\n\nMukbangers incurring income from such videos can earn from advertising.^[6]\nThis performance of eating can allow top broadcasters to earn as much as\n$10,000 a month which does not include sponsorships. Live-streaming platforms\nlike AfreecaTV and Twitch allow viewers to send payments to their favorite\nstreamers.^[28]\n\nCreators can also earn income through endorsements, e-books, and product\nreviews. Bethany Gaskin, under the name Bloveslife for her channel, has made\nover $1 million from advertising on her videos as reported by The New York\nTimes.^[6]\n\nSoo Tang, also known as MommyTang on YouTube, is a mukbanger with 490,000\nsubscribers on her channel. In an interview with Today Food, Tang claimed that\nsuccessful mukbangers can earn about $100,000 in a year.^[6]\n\n## Top mukbangers[edit]\n\nThe following list of top mukbangers around the world include those people who\nhave been quoted in news channels and broadcasts worldwide.\n\nChannel(s)| Country| Primary Platform| Host(s)| Notes  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nblndsundoll4mj| United States| YouTube| Trisha Paytas| She is one the earliest\nYouTubers to \"catch the trend\" and post mukbang videos.

The Ministry of Health and Welfare announced the\nmeasures, which were intended to address binge eating and harm to the public\nhealth caused by mukbang. Criticisms were levied against the ministry: the\nBlue House petition board received about 40 petitions against mukbang\nregulations, which maintained arguments such as \"there is no correlation\nbetween mukbang and binge eating\" and \"the government is infringing on\nindividual freedom.\"^[43]\n\nA study, which investigated the popularity of mukbang and its health impacts\non the public, analyzed media coverage, articles, and YouTube video content\nrelated to \"mukbang\" and concluded that people who frequently watch mukbang\nmay be more susceptible to adopting poor eating habits.^[21] In a survey\ninvolving 380 non-nutrition majors at a university in Gyeonggi Province, and\ntheir tendencies to watch mukbang and its close variant, cookbang, a\nsignificant 29.1% of frequent mukbang-watchers self-diagnosed negative habits,\nsuch as increased intake of processed and delivered foods or eating out.^[44]\nMukbang has also been credited as a dietary restriction device for curbing\nfood cravings and excessive watching may be correlated with the exacerbation\nor relapse of eating disorders.^[45]\n\nA netnographic analysis of popular mukbang videos on YouTube revealed a\nsignificant number of viewer comments expressing fascination with the ability\nto remain thin after ingesting large amounts of unhealthy foods, a major\nsubcategory of which attempted to explain this phenomenon by citing intense\nphysical exercise by the hosts, physiological quirks such as a \"fast\nmetabolism\", or by attributing it to the host's Asian ethnicity.^[46] BJs'\nexperiences with fat shaming and their underweight counterparts' with\nspeculation for purging and engaging in other unhealthy eating habits off-\ncamera were also noted.^[46]\n\nIn 2019, Ukrainian-born American mukbanger Nicholas Perry, known as Nikocado\nAvocado, shared that the amount of binge eating from mukbang has taken a toll\non his health, leading to issues such as erectile dysfunction, frequent\ndiarrhea, sleep apnea, mobility problems and weight gain.^[47]^[48]\n\nIn 2023, Indian Mukbanger Ashifa, known as Ashifa ASMR, shared that the food\nshown in mukbang videos cannot be consumed all in one go. She resorts to\neating the food in multiple sittings and just edit the videos to make it a\ncontinuously shot video. According to her, this fact has been disclosed in her\ndisclaimers as a caution to the viewers to prevent unhealthy eating\nhabits.^[42]\n\n### Food wastage[edit]\n\nExcessive amounts of food can be consumed and wasted during mukbang.\n\nTo prevent weight gain, some mukbangers chew food and then spit it out, but\nedit their videos to remove the spitting, to create the false impression that\na large volume of food has been consumed. In 2020, South Korean mukbanger Moon\nBok Hee, who uploaded on YouTube under Eat With Boki, was criticized for\nspitting out her food in her videos. This came after dubious editing portions\nwas observed in her videos, leading many of her viewers to doubt their\nauthenticity.^[49]^[35]^[50]\n\nIn 2020, General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping launched\nthe 'Clean Plate' campaign, calling on the nation to guard against food waste.\nThis campaign prompted state-run media outlets such as CCTV to run reports\ncritical of mukbangers. Users on several Chinese apps received warnings about\ntheir mukbang contents and faced an influx of negative comments.^[51] Later,\nDouyin promised to have stricter verification on food-related videos. Other\nmedia platforms, including Bilibili and Kuaishou, have encouraged not wasting\nfood.^[52]\n\n### Incidents of animal cruelty[edit]\n\nSee also: Cruelty to animals and Shock site\n\nSeveral mukbang streamers, particularly Ssoyoung, have received attention and\nmuch criticism for inflicting cruelty to living sea creatures before and\nduring their consumption in their mukbang videos. Examples of live animals\nthat Ssoyoung has subjected to prolonged bodily harm while alive include fish,\nsharks, crabs, squid, and octopuses, and include an incident where Ssoyoung\npoured table salt onto a basin of live eels, and an incident where squids had\ntheir mantles cut off, but were supposedly kept alive before having soy sauce\npoured over their exposed nerves, inflicting excessive pain and suffering to\nthe animals.^[33] In reality the squid were dead before consumption and the\nsupposed \"dancing\" was the result of involuntary movement.^[8]^[53]^[54]\n\n### Health impacts[edit]\n\n#### Eating disorders[edit]\n\nYoutubers drinking alcoholic drinks on \"Cold Ones\"\n\nA study in 2021 which addressed Mukbang and the effect of influencers' food\nconsumption on their viewers showed that engaging in \"problematic mukbang\nwatching\" was positively associated with eating disorders and with internet\naddiction.^[55] In addition, academics and dietitians added that mukbangers\nand their viewers often have a bad relationship with their eating habits, and\nits popularity only serves to further encourage such behaviors.^[55]^[56]^[57]\n\n#### Alcohol consumption[edit]\n\nA sulbang (\uc220\ubc29, pronounced [sulpa\u014b]) or eating show with alcohol videos can be\nwatched by anyone including minors, which may inadvertently stimulate alcohol\nconsumption among teenagers.^[58]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Cooking show\n  * Food competition\n  * Food porn\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c ^d Kim, Yeran (4 June 2020). \"Eating as a transgression: Multisensorial performativity in the carnal videos of mukbang (eating shows)\".
