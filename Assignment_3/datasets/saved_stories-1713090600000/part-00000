Having just started\nfresh as Junior Linux sysadmin at a major German telecommunications provider.\nStrictly speaking, the rule was the following: \"No standard changes to a\nproduction system if the next day isn't a normal workday.\" This was put in\nplace to ensure that problems in production can be fixed in a timely manner,\nthat all required resources and people are available. A plain, simple logical\nrule\u2014and a very effective one.\n\nBut how do my wisdom teeth come into play? Well, as I am currently learning\nfor my ITIL4 certification, I remembered a story from that time. I was\nvisiting my dentist, and the whole appointment just felt strange. I knew I had\nsome minor pain in one or two teeth a few weeks ago. Which was when I first\nvisited them. But the dentist\u2014a big clinic with several doctors\u2014did not have\nenough time at that point and gave me a new appointment.\n\nNaive as I was, I didn't note down what would be done at that appointment.\nTrusting that the doctor will document everything, right? Well.. He didn't.\nThis time I got another doctor, and he did the one thing I remembered and then\njust left the room. I wasn't told the appointment was over. It didn't feel\nlike it was over. So I just kept sitting in the chair, waiting.\n\nSome 10 minutes later, a doctor's assistant comes into the room to prepare it\nand is surprised I am still there. I am told that I am free to go, and, well,\nI do. I had just put my jacket on when another assistant approached me. \"Oh,\ngood that I managed to catch you. You need to make an appointment for the\nremoval of two of your wisdom teeth. The doctor spotted caries in them.\"\n\nI was surprised. He didn't say anything about that. But, ah, well. Doctors can\nhave a bad day too. So off to the reception I went to make an appointment for\nthe removal. Only to learn that these removals are done by an external doctor\nwho solely does wisdom teeth removal. Additionally, all of his appointments\nfor the next 3 months are fully booked. The reason? He is only present on\nFridays.\n\nImmediately, the beloved ITIL phrase comes to mind. Realizing full well that\nif I should have any pain or bigger problems, I will be in minor trouble.\nHaving to go to the emergency on-call dentist in my town for that weekend\u2014or\ndirectly to the hospital. I wasn't really keen on that. So the receptionist\nand I agreed that I would call some days later to schedule an appointment when\nI had sufficient time to organize my calendars.\n\nOnly that.. Well, I never called back. I grew more and more suspicious over\nthe days and said to myself, \"Let's wait until I start to feel something in my\nteeth.\" The doctor's strange behavior didn't contribute to my inner well-being\neither.\n\nI waited. And waited. And waited. And when it was time for my next regular\ndentist visit, I decided to get a second opinion. I asked some colleagues,\nchecked a few \"Rate your doctor\" websites, and went to another dentist.\n\nThere, they did an X-ray of my whole jaw to get a complete overview. The\ndoctor was nice. Explained what he was looking for. What he can and can't see,\nand I asked fairly simply if there is any caries in some of my wisdom teeth.\nHe looked a bit stunned for a second and said, \"No, not from what I see. If\nthere is caries, usually black spots are visible. But there are none, as far\nas I can see. Do you feel any pain? Especially when they come into contact\nwith something hot or cold?\"\n\nSo, I explained the whole situation to him, and then he told me a few details\n(which I won't write down here for legal reasons), which made it obvious to me\nthat changing my dentist was indeed a good decision.\n\nAnd all of that, just because I followed ITIL procedures from my employer.
