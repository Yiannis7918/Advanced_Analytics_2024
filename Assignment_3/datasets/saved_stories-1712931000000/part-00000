For example, you might want to show\na progress bar to your users when they are uploading a file, or when they are\ndownloading something. Some Use cases:\n\n  * Show a progress bar to your users when they are uploading a file.\n  * Show a progress bar to your users when they are downloading something.\n  * Show a progress bar to your users when they are processing a form.\n  * When reading a blog post, show a progress bar to show long is left to read.\n\n### Let\u2019s create the structure\n\nThe important parts:\n\n  * x-data=\"{ progress: 0, interval: null }\" is the data that will be used to store the progress value.\n  * x-init=\"() => { interval = setInterval(() => { progress < 100 ? progress += 5 : clearInterval(interval); }, 100); }\" is the code that will be executed every 100ms to update the progress value.\n  * x-text=\"progress + '%'\" is the code that will be executed to display the progress value.\n  * x-bind:style=\"'width: ' + progress + '%;'\" is the code that will be executed to set the width of the progress bar.\n\n    \n    \n    <div x-data=\"{ progress: 0, interval: null }\" x-init=\"() => { interval = setInterval(() => { progress < 100 ? progress += 5 : clearInterval(interval); }, 100); }\"> <div x-text=\"progress + '%'\"> </div> <div> <div x-bind:style=\"'width: ' + progress + '%;'\" > </div> </div> </div>\n\n### Let\u2019s add some the classes with Tailwind CSS\n\nThe important parts:\n\n  * w-full is the width of the container.\n  * text-sm text-gray-500 is the text color.\n  * bg-gray-200 is the background color.\n  * rounded-full is the border radius.\n  * h-2 is the height of the progress bar.\n  * transition-all is the transition effect.\n  * ease-in-out is the animation effect.\n  * duration-500 is the duration of the animation.\n  * cursor-pointer is the cursor style.\n  * relative is the positioning style.\n  * overflow-hidden is the overflow style.\n\n    \n    \n    <div x-data=\"{ progress: 0, interval: null }\" x-init=\"() => { interval = setInterval(() => { progress < 100 ? progress += 5 : clearInterval(interval); }, 100); }\" class=\"w-full\"> <div class=\"text-sm text-gray-500\" x-text=\"progress + '%'\"> </div> <div class=\"relative h-2 mt-2 bg-gray-200 rounded-full\"> <div x-bind:style=\"'width: ' + progress + '%;'\" class=\"absolute top-0 left-0 h-full bg-orange-500 rounded-full\"> </div> </div> </div>\n\nWell that was it!
