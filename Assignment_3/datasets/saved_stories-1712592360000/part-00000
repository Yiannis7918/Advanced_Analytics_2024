That\nby trying your best to couch employee performance feedback in overly gentle\nlanguage, you end up confusing the message, and cheating the recipient out of\nthe clarity they desperately need to improve \u2013 or prepare for what happens if\nthey don't.\n\nThis concept extends to more than just direct employee feedback. It can also\nseep into other forms of communication, policies, and ultimately the entire\nculture. At 37signals, we've labeled this broader problem being \"overly\nprecious\".\n\nLet me give you an example. We used to have official \"mental health days\" for\nemployees. With an explicit invitation that people really should just take\nsome time off if they felt \"overwhelmed\" or \"mentally fatigued\". Here's the\nold paragraph:\n\n> Basecamp recognizes, too, that your mental health is just as important as\n> your physical health. Consider taking a mental health day every now and\n> again when you're feeling overwhelmed or mentally fatigued. If a day or two\n> won't cut it, we'll work with you to find a way to reduce the burden of your\n> work at Basecamp on your overall mental health. We really do want your work\n> at Basecamp to be the best work you do in your life, and we appreciate that\n> that's not possible if you're uncertain about your health.\n\nThat's precious. Overly precious. In fact, I cringe when I now read this. The\nidea that employees are so mentally fragile that \"feeling overwhelmed\" is a\nreason to be absent is bonkers. Everyone feels \"overwhelmed\" every now and\nthen. That's not an adequate reason not to show up for work!\n\nCould you imagine if the rest of the world ran on something like this? That\nyour trash cans wouldn't get emptied if the truck driver \"felt overwhelmed\"?\nNo. Just no.\n\nNot every day is going to be magical at work. Some days you really do just\nhave to power through. And if you can't, then use some paid time off to\nrecover. Taking it out of the same allowance that someone else would spend on\na holiday.\n\nIn fact, I've come to believe that this type of language and expectation\nsetting actually makes people more fragile. That it plants the idea that\nworking in front of a computer is so mentally taxing that almost nobody can\nbear it without the occasional \"mental health day\". That's just not true, and\nit's not helpful.\n\nGetting rid of this nonsense is part of how we've been scrubbing the precious\nout of the organization. And we've been far better off for it over the past\nfew years.\n\nThat doesn't mean scrubbing out caring. It doesn't mean turning into a hard\nass. The opposite of precious is not being cruel, but being clear. It's\nexpecting a reasonable baseline from people that anyone out in ThE ReAL wORlD\ncould recognize as fair.\n\nBeing too precious is the same as being fragile. That's not a goal to aspire\nto. We should all be chasing higher resilience instead.\n\nAbout David Heinemeier Hansson\n\nMade Basecamp and HEY for the underdogs as co-owner and CTO of 37signals.\nCreated Ruby on Rails.
