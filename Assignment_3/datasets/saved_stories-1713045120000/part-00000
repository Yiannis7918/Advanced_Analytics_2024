While I have half a dozen cameras laying around\nthe house, none of them support this.\n\nDisclaimer: I have not yet moved to Klipper but it is on the list and I\u2019m\naware will probably solve some of these problems (and/or make new ones)\n\nSomething went wrong\n\nSuccess!\n\n### Cheap Wyze/Kasa Cameras#\n\nThose cheap $20 cameras you can get on Amazon are pretty great. Of course,\nthey\u2019re all locked down to only work with their associated mobile apps out of\nthe box, but most are able to be exposed over RTMP if you do some command line\nwith FFMPEG.\n\nThese cameras can\u2019t really work wtih Octoprint without you doing something\ncrazy like converting RTMP to an mjpeg stream, which feels like going\nbackwards. I have done this in the past and don\u2019t recommend it.\n\nI\u2019ll cover setting up RTMP on the 2 cameras I\u2019m using, the Xiamoi Yi 4k+ and a\nKasa EC60, in the setup steps below.\n\n### The Pi Problem#\n\nThe real issue with using Octoprint to stream your 3d printer videos is the\nhardware most people are running it on. A Raspberry pi that\u2019s working with the\nprinter to figure our GCODE to stepper-motor translation isn\u2019t the place to\nalso pipe in one or more HD live stream feeds, unless you want skipped steps\nand layer shifts.\n\n## Enter Youtube Live#\n\nNow that we don\u2019t have to worry about Octoprint\u2019s restrictions, we\u2019ll have to\nfigure out where our stream will live. Youtube Live will let us easily stream\ndozens of hours of our printer feed with no hassle and make sure it\u2019s\navailable anywhere with an internet connection. We also can make clips, seek\nback 2 hours to see why a print failed, etc.\n\nWhy deal with your own stream when YT makes this so nice and easy (and free!)\n\n## The Full List of Tools#\n\nHere\u2019s everything we\u2019ll be using to make our stream.\n\n  * Youtube Live\n  * OBS Studio for streaming to Youtube\n\n    * URL/API Plugin for OBS to create our job and temp data.\n  * Yi 4k+ and Kasa EC60 setup for RTMP Streaming\n\n    * QR Code Generator for Yi4k RTMP stream\n  * Monaserver to run our own RTMP Server\n  * FFMPEG\n\n## Setting up RTMP#\n\nSetting up Monaserver is simple. We don\u2019t need to do any configuration, just\ndownload and run it and make sure you see Protocols.h[82] RTMP server started\non 0.0.0.0:1935 in the console when it launches.\n\n### Camera Setup#\n\nIf you happen to have a Yi 4k+, it comes with a live stream mode out of the\nbox. You can use this qr code generator to connecto to Monaserver. You\u2019ll need\nto enter the local IP Address of the computer running Monaserver for the RTMP\nURL: x.x.x.x:1935 and enter your wifi details as well. It\u2019s handy to print\nthis out on paper so you can easily connect the camera when you need to.\n\nFor the Kasa EC60 or similar, I followed this article to get RTMP working. I\ndid not find all the info in the article to be correct. You should just be\nable to update and save the code below in a .bat file on Windows and run the\nfile after your start Mona and connect to the Kasa camera.\n\nBe sure to replace KASA_EMAIL_ADDRESS, MY_PASSWORD and [KASA_IP_ADDRESS]\nbefore use.\n\n    \n    \n    @echo off F:\\download\\curl-8.7.1_6-win64-mingw\\curl-8.7.1_6-win64-mingw\\bin\\curl.exe -vv -k -u KASA_EMAIL_ADDRESS:MY_PASSWORD --ignore-content-length \"https://[KASA_IP_ADDRESS]:19443/https/stream/mixed?video=h264&audio=g711\" --output - |ffmpeg -re -i - -f flv rtmp://127.0.0.1:1935/live/2\n\n## Setting up OBS#\n\nNow that we have our cameras both streaming out to Monaserver, we can start\nsetting up OBS with the inputs we\u2019ll need.\n\nI\u2019ve exported my OBS Scene with all features here. You should just need to\nchange the camera setups if different than I\u2019m using and replace the Auth\ntoken for the Octoprint API.\n\n### Cameras#\n\nImporting our feeds into OBS is easy. Just select New Source \u2013> Media Source\nand enter rtmp://127.0.0.1:1935/live\n\nif you setup a 2nd camera, setup a 2nd Media Source and enter\nrtmp://127.0.0.1:1935/live/2\n\n### Data#\n\nGetting all our data in will be a bit more challenging. The URL/API Source\nPlugin can help us set this up in a nice way.\n\nYou\u2019ll need an API key from Octoprint to set this up. I won\u2019t go into each\nsource I\u2019ve setup, but I\u2019ll briefly cover how to use the plugin.\n\n  * After you install the plugin, setup a new source and select URL/API, then click Setup Data Source.\n\n  * Enter http://[MY_OCTOPRINT_IP]:5000/api/printer in the URL field and setup a new header `Authorization: BEARER [MY_OCTOPRINT_KEY].\n\n  * In the JSON Pointer field, enter /temperature/tool0/actual to grab the Extruder Temperature from the API. Other fields can be pulled in in a similar way.\n\n  * Exit the Data Source screen and scroll down to the output template. Enter Extruder Temp: {{output}}\u00b0\n\n### Print Image#\n\nThe last thing we\u2019ll walk through setting up is the print image. This requires\nthe Slicer Thumbnails plugin for Octoprint and that you setup your slicer to\noutput the preview images.\n\nCaution: I tried dynamically pulling in the jpg file through the URL/API\nsource based on the active job file name, but the string manipulation tools in\nthe plugin/OBS didn\u2019t let me find a way that could work. I know setting up\nthings this way is pretty nonstandard \u2013 If you can get the image URL pulled\ninto OBS dynamically, please leave a comment!\n\n  * Create a Browser Source and enter your Octoprint Dashboard URL.\n  * Open the filters pane on the Browser Source and select \u201cCrop/Pad\u201d and adjust the cropping to only show the printer image\n  * Create a new filter \u201cColor Key\u201d, pick custom color and select white (#ffffff)\n  * Adjust the settings to make the background transparent\n  * Optionally add a \u201cColor Correction\u201d filter to change the color of the image.\n\n## Final Thoughts#\n\nAnd that\u2019s it! Now you can multi-camera monitor your 3d prints from anywhere.\nWith this and the telegram notification plugin in Octoprint to tell me when\nprints are done, I\u2019m having a much better 3d print experience than in the\npast.\n\nI\u2019ve also recently spent a ton of time fine-tuning my Kingroon trying to get\nas close to perfect settings and dimensions and may do a quick write up on\nthat in the near future since there were some things even as a long time 3d\nprinter that were new to me.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n  * 3dprint\n  * all\n  * Tutorial\n\nSomething went wrong\n\nSuccess!\n\n\u00a9 2024 Reticulated Powered by Hugo & PaperMod\n\nThanks for reading!
