There are no known cases of CWD transmission to humans. Photo by\nMoose Henderson / Alamy Stock Photo\n\nThe hunting community is experiencing whiplash after several articles appeared\non mainstream news sites this week announcing that two hunters have died after\neating venison from deer with chronic wasting disease. Wildlife experts say\nthere is no evidence to support these claims.\n\nViral news website The Daily Mail published a story on Thursday titled \u201cTwo\nhunters \u2018become first Americans to die from ZOMBIE DEER disease\u2019 after eating\ninfected venison.\u201d The coverage is based on a research abstract published in\nNeurology on April 9 titled \u201cTwo Hunters from the Same Lodge Afflicted with\nSporadic CJD: Is Chronic Wasting Disease to Blame?\u201d The Mail story also\nappears to draw on the article \u201cStudy: Hunters Die After Consuming CWD-\nInfected Venison\u201d published by Field & Stream Wednesday. (The F&S article has\nsince been removed and replaced with more skeptical coverage of the Neurology\nabstract; a syndicated version of the original story remained on Yahoo! News\nat press time.) Now false reports of CWD infecting humans are spreading\nconcerns and misinformation on hunting forums and social media.\n\n\u201cThis is not a study and this is not a scientific paper,\u201d veteran deer\nbiologist and wildlife science coordinator for the Arizona Game and Fish\nDepartment Jim Heffelfinger wrote in an Instagram post Thursday. \u201cThe whole\nthing is only 344 words and is simply a mention about two hunters that died of\n[Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease] and both of them ate deer from the same deer\npopulation. There is no evidence of CWD infecting hunters.\u201d\n\nThe authors \u2014 three of whom are doctors of neurology and one an MD candidate\nat the University of Texas San Antonio Long School of Medicine \u2014 attempt to\nconnect two men who died from sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in 2022 to a\npopulation of CWD-infected deer the men supposedly hunted and ate. CJD is a\nprion disease that affects humans and behaves similarly to CWD and other\ntransmissible spongiform encephalopathies, like mad cow disease in cows and\nscrapie in sheep. The research abstract says the men both died from sporadic\nCJD, which is the most common version of the disease; it\u2019s thought to occur\nrandomly and mostly impacts people older than 60. (There are three kinds of\nCJD: sporadic, variant, and genetic. Variant CJD can come from contamination\nin surgical settings or eating beef from cows with mad cow disease, according\nto the Mayo Clinic. Genetic CJD is caused by an inherited predisposition.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that this sketchy report has caused the alarm and confusion\nthat it has,\u201d National Deer Association\u2019s director of communications Lindsay\nThomas, Jr. tells Outdoor Life. The NDA published a response to the abstract\non Thursday. \u201cThere are no details, no evidence, or facts presented, so\nthere\u2019s not much to go on. But the bottom line is, nothing has changed. We\nstill don\u2019t have evidence of transmission of CWD from deer to people. We\ndidn\u2019t before, and this doesn\u2019t change that. Nothing changes about the advice\nfor people regarding CWD and their health, either. If you hunt in a CWD zone,\nget your deer tested and wait for the results before you eat the venison.\u201d\n\nIn an email to Outdoor Life, a representative of Neurology described its\narticle as \u201ca scientific abstract presented at the 2024 American Academy of\nNeurology Annual Meeting and reprinted in Neurology.\u201d The research abstract\ndoes not mention where the men hunted or whether the deer they consumed\nvenison from was ever tested for CWD.\n\n\u201cAfter speaking with [one of the authors] Dr. Sarah Horn, she informed us that\nthe information is not from a research study, it was a poster presentation of\na case report presented at the AAN annual meeting,\u201d UT Health San Antonio\npublic and media relations specialist Eileen Teves tells Outdoor Life in an\nemail statement. \u201cThe conclusion from that presentation was there remain no\nproven cases of transmission to date.\u201d\n\n## Factual Problems with the Latest \u2018Zombie Deer Disease\u2019 News\n\nJust because a deer lives in a CWD zone doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s infected. Photo by\nKenny Seals / USFWS\n\nThe Neurology abstract centers on \u201ca 72-year-old man with a history of\nconsuming meat from a CWD-infected deer population\u201d and his friend, who also\nate venison from the same population and had recently died from CJD. The first\nman passed away a month after developing symptoms of CJD. A post-mortem\nconfirmed CJD was the cause of death. The Neurology abstract does acknowledge\nthe limitations of its attempt to link CWD and CJD: \u201cAlthough causation\nremains unproven, this cluster emphasizes the need for further investigation\ninto the potential risks of consuming CWD-infected deer and its implications\nfor public health.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are clusters of CJD throughout the country \u2014 some in CWD areas and some\noutside CWD areas,\u201d writes Heffelfinger. \u201cWith the spread of CWD nationwide it\nis not very noteworthy that [two] CJD victims in the same rural area may have\nboth eaten venison. We have to be vigilant about the possible jump of a Prion\ndisease from deer to hunter, but this note appears to me to be a very careless\nand childish attempt at making a splash in the media.\u201d\n\nThe abstract does not include proof that the venison the men ate actually came\nfrom an infected deer. In fact, CWD prevalence is quite low, so eating venison\nfrom a deer herd known to contain CWD doesn\u2019t even mean you might be eating\nvenison from a CWD-infected deer. Hunters harvest uninfected deer from CWD\nhost herds every season. The only way to know for sure is to test your deer\nfor CWD.\n\n\u201cMost of the deer populations across the country where we have found CWD,\nprevalence rates are very low, in the single digits in most cases,\u201d Thomas\nsays. \u201cMissouri has been fighting CWD for 12 years. They have CWD in 33\ndifferent zones. All of those zones are under three percent prevalence.\nSeventy-five percent of them are under one percent prevalence. You can hunt,\nharvest, and eat a lot of deer before you encounter one that has CWD.\u201d\n\nWhile the Daily Mail article opens with a bullet point reading \u201cA study\nsuggests that two men in Wyoming died from chronic wasting disease,\u201d nowhere\nelse in the article does the author make any mention of the state of Wyoming.\nNothing in the research abstract mentions Wyoming hunters, either. One photo\nin the Mail is captioned \u201cBecause CWD is so contagious, when one deer is\nconfirmed to have died from it, an entire herd is infected.\u201d This is\ncategorically false, as Thomas points out.\n\nRead Next: Here\u2019s What Top Chronic Wasting Disease Researchers Can\u2019t Say on\nthe Record\n\nMisinformation about CWD is all too familiar to the deer biologists, wildlife\ndisease pathologists, and hunters who are informed about the issue.\n(Mainstream media\u2019s continued use of the misnomer \u201czombie deer disease\u201d is a\nmajor culprit.) But the implications of CWD transmission to humans are far too\ngreat to be treated so casually by both the research and media communities,\nThomas says.\n\n\u201cThat just makes this report seem all the more shaky, and thin, and casually\nirresponsible. This question of CWD in human health is so important. It would\nhave such an impact on deer hunting and conservation and wildlife in North\nAmerica, that it must be treated extremely carefully and cautiously and with\nan abundance of evidence and investigation. And it does not appear to me from\nthis paper that that\u2019s what occurred here. Were these neurologists strictly\nlooking at this from a human dimension? They seem unaware of the implications\nof what they\u2019re saying for deer hunting and wildlife conservation. This is\njust me speculating, but they don\u2019t seem to be aware of the earthquake they\nhave just caused in the hunting community.\u201d\n\n##### Share\n\n  * Big Game Hunting\n\n  * Conservation\n\n  * Deer Hunting\n\n  * Hunting\n\n  * Mule Deer Hunting\n\n  * Whitetail Deer Hunting\n\n  * Wildlife Management\n\nSummary\n\nA research article attempting to link the death of two hunters to chronic\nwasting disease in venison has kickstarted a media frenzy.
