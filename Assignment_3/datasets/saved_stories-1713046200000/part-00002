Now, a new study suggests\nthat for the ancient Egyptians, a key figure of their cosmos \u2013 the sky goddess\nNut \u2013 may have been linked to the most prominent feature of the night sky: our\nown galaxy the Milky Way.\n\nIn Egyptian mythology, Nut (pronounced \u201cnoot\u201d) was a central deity, the\ngoddess of the sky itself. She was often depicted as a woman arched over the\nearth, her body covered in stars. The Sun god Ra was said to travel across her\nbody each day, disappearing into her mouth at sunset and emerging again,\nreborn, at dawn from between her legs.\n\nBut while Egyptologists have long known of Nut\u2019s symbolic connection to the\nsky, her specific link to astronomical features was less clear. Was she just a\nfigurative representation, or did the Egyptians tie her to something they\ncould actually observe?\n\nThat\u2019s the question that Dr. Or Graur, an astrophysics professor at the\nUniversity of Portsmouth, set out to investigate. Using advanced astronomical\nsoftware, he simulated what the night sky would have looked like in ancient\nEgypt during different eras and seasons. Then, he compared those views to\ndescriptions of Nut found in key Egyptian texts. His paper is published in the\nJournal of Astronomical History and Heritage.\n\nWhat Graur discovered was intriguing. In the \u201cFundamentals of the Course of\nthe Stars,\u201d a cosmological text from around 1880 BCE, Nut\u2019s head was described\nas aligned with the western horizon, with her arms outstretched to the north\nand south. Meanwhile, her groin was placed in the east.\n\nThe image shows the sky goddess Nut, covered in stars, is held aloft by her\nfather, Shu, and is arched over Geb, her brother the Earth god. On the left,\nthe rising sun (the falcon-headed god Re) sails up Nut\u2019s legs. On the right,\nthe setting sun sails down her arms towards the outstretched arms of Osiris,\nwho will regenerate the sun in the netherworld during the night. (Credit: E.\nA. Wallis Budge, The Gods of the Egyptians, Vol. 2 (Methuen & Co., 1904))\n\nWhen Graur looked at his astronomical simulations, he found something similar.\nDuring summer nights in ancient Egypt, the Milky Way would have stretched\nacross the sky from northeast to southwest, in an orientation very close to\nthe description of Nut\u2019s torso. In the winter months, the orientation shifted,\nto run from northwest to southeast \u2013 now highlighting the goddess\u2019s\noutstretched arms.\n\nSo was the Milky Way literally seen as the body of Nut arching over the earth\neach night? Graur believes the connection may have been more figurative than\nliteral. Nut\u2019s roles as the all-encompassing sky and mother of the sun\nrequired her to remain eternally present, a static backdrop against which the\nSun, Moon and stars cycled in their daily and yearly rhythms.\n\nThe Milky Way, on the other hand, changes position hour by hour as the earth\nrotates, with different sections rising and setting throughout the night.\nRather than strictly embodying the Milky Way, then, Graur suggests that the\nshifting celestial band may have served as a symbolic marker of Nut\u2019s body,\nemphasizing different aspects of her at different times \u2013 her torso in the\nsummer months, her arms in winter.\n\nInterestingly, Graur found similar mythological themes in other cultures\nacross the world. From the Eastern Pawnee of North America to the Navajo and\nthe Maya, the Milky Way is often seen as intimately connected to the\nafterlife, a path that souls travel to reach the realm of the dead. Nut, too,\nwas linked to the afterlife in Egyptian belief. She was said to ingest the Sun\neach night only to give birth to it again at dawn, a cycle of death and\nrebirth. She received the souls of deceased kings and helped them ascend to\nthe imperishable stars.\n\nMilky Way Panorama at Aoraki Mackenzie International Dark Sky Reserve (Photo\nby eroxust on Shutterstock)\n\nThe cross-cultural parallels don\u2019t end there. In Ptolemaic Egypt, Nut was\nlinked to the autumn bird migration that brought millions of avians south from\nEurasia each fall. A text describes them arriving from the \u201cnorthwest to\nnortheast\u201d \u2013 directions that line up with the orientation of the Milky Way in\nthose months. The birds were said to emerge from the Duat \u2013 the Egyptian\nunderworld, a place Nut swallowed the Sun into each night. It\u2019s a concept that\nbears an almost eerie similarity to myths from the Baltic region of Europe,\nwhere the Milky Way was seen as the path birds followed on their southward\nmigration.\n\nOf course, we must be cautious about drawing too many parallels between\ndistant cultures. The night sky is vast, and the human imagination even more\nso \u2013 similarities can arise by pure coincidence. But Graur\u2019s research provides\na tantalizing possibility, a new way of glimpsing how one of the world\u2019s\noldest civilizations may have made sense of the cosmos wheeling above them.\n\n\u201cI chanced upon the sky-goddess Nut when I was writing a book on galaxies and\nlooking into the mythology of the Milky Way. I took my daughters to a museum\nand they were enchanted by this image of an arched woman and kept asking to\nhear stories about her,\u201d Graur says in a university media release. \u201cMy\nresearch shows how combining disciplines can offer new insights into ancient\nbeliefs, and it highlights how astronomy connects humanity across cultures,\ngeography, and time. This paper is an exciting start to a larger project to\ncatalog and study the multicultural mythology of the Milky Way.\u201d\n\nThe ancient Egyptians, like us, were naturally drawn to the Milky Way, that\nmost spectacular of night sky phenomena. And in a world where the boundaries\nbetween earth and heaven, natural and supernatural were fluid, it\u2019s not hard\nto imagine them projecting one of their most powerful deities onto that\nshimmering celestial path.\n\nNut\u2019s embrace may no longer literally arch above us. But when you find\nyourself under a clear night sky, take a moment to trace the path of the Milky\nWay as it shifts from season to season. In connecting yourself to that view,\nyou connect yourself, in a way, to the ancient Egyptians who once spun their\nstories in the stars.\n\nTags: ancient egypt, astronomy, Milky Way\n\nAdd a Comment\n\nRandom ArticleNext Article\n\nAbout the Author\n\n### StudyFinds Editor\n\nView StudyFinds's article archive\n\nThe contents of this website do not constitute advice and are provided for\ninformational purposes only.
