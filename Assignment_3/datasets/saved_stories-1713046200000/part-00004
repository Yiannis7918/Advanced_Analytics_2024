The FCC Needs to Stop Them\n\nBy Barbara van Schewick on April 11, 2024 at 5:18 pm\n\nThe FCC is set to vote on April 25 to restore its authority over the companies\nwe pay to get online, and reinstate federal net neutrality protections that\nwere jettisoned by the Trump administration in 2017.\n\nNet neutrality protections are supposed to ensure that we, not the internet\nservice providers (ISPs) we pay to get online, get to decide what we do\nonline.\n\nThe FCC released its draft rules early in April and there\u2019s much to celebrate\nin them. Mobile carriers like T-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon that have been\ndegrading video quality for mobile users will have to stop. The FCC kept in\nplace state neutrality protections like California\u2019s net neutrality law,\nallowing for layers of enforcement. The FCC also made it harder for ISPs to\nevade net neutrality at the point where data enters their networks.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a huge problem: the proposed rules make it possible for\nmobile ISPs to start picking applications and putting them in a fast lane -\nwhere they\u2019ll perform better generally and much better if the network gets\ncongested.\n\nT-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon are all testing ways to create these 5G fast lanes\nfor apps such as video conferencing, games, and video where the ISP chooses\nand controls what gets boosted. They use a technical feature in 5G called\nnetwork slicing, where part of their radio spectrum gets used as a special\nlane for the chosen app or apps, separated from the usual internet traffic.\n\nThe FCC\u2019s draft order opens the door to these fast lanes, so long as the app\nprovider isn\u2019t charged for them.\n\nThat means we could soon see fast lane offerings like this:\n\nOr we could see add-ons like Enhanced Video Conferencing for $10 a month, or\none-time 24-hour passes to have Prioritized Online Gaming.\n\nThis isn't imagination.\n\nThe ISPs write about this in their blogs and press releases. They talk about\nthese efforts and dreams openly at conferences, and their equipment vendors\nplainly lay out how ISPs can chop up internet service into all manner of fast\nlanes.\n\nThese kinds of ISP-controlled fast lanes violate core net neutrality\nprinciples and would limit user choice, distort competition, hamper startups,\nand help cement platform dominance.\n\nNet neutrality means that we, the people who use the internet, get to decide\nwhat we do online, without interference from ISPs. ISPs do not get to\ninterfere with our choices by blocking, speeding up or slowing down apps or\nkinds of apps. Apps compete on a level playing field, and users, not ISPs,\ndetermine which apps are successful.\n\nLetting ISPs decide which apps get to be in a fast lane violates these\nprinciples. Apps that are in a fast lane work better than those that are not,\nespecially when the network is busy and apps in the regular lane start\nsuffering. If HBO Max is in a fast lane, it will continue to work well even if\nthe network is busy, while all other video is buffering.\n\nDifferences in performance, including relative differences in performance,\nmatter. Even small differences in load times affect how long people stay on a\nsite, how much they pay, and whether they\u2019ll come back. Those differences also\naffect how high up sites show in search results.\n\nThus, letting ISPs choose which apps get to be in a fast lane lets them, not\nusers, pick winners and losers online.\n\nAnd as we\u2019ve seen in the past, programs like this favor the most popular apps,\neven when the program is supposedly open to all apps in a category and no apps\nare paying the ISP. So the biggest apps will end up in all the fast lanes,\nwhile most others would be left out. The ones left out would likely include\nmessaging apps like Signal, local news sites, decentralized Fediverse apps\nlike Mastodon and PeerTube, niche video sites like Dropout, indie music sites\nlike Bandcamp, and the millions of other sites and apps in the long tail.\n\nLegislators, government agencies, attorneys general in states both red and\nblue, public interest groups, startups, and open-source technologists are all\nworking to reduce the power and dominance of the biggest platforms. The FCC\nshould be working to help that effort by creating a level playing field and\nbanning these ISP-controlled 5G fast lanes.\n\nMeaningful net neutrality protections prohibit ISPs from speeding up and\nslowing down apps and kinds of apps.\n\nISPs can pick winners and losers by putting winners in a fast lane or losers\nin a slow lane.\n\nThis is a what it would look like if an ISP put everything except YouTube and\nTikTok in a slow lane.\n\nThis is what it would look like if an ISP put YouTube and TikTok in a fast\nlane.\n\nIt\u2019s the same picture. The effect is the same. In either case, disfavored apps\nwill find it harder to compete.\n\nMeaningful net neutrality protections need to protect against both.\n\nThis is not controversial.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s November 2014 net neutrality proposal included this\nprotection:\n\n\u201cThe rules I am asking for are simple, common-sense steps that reflect the\nInternet you and I use every day.\u201d That included, he said, a brightline ban on\nISPs \u201cintentionally slow[ing] down some content or speed[ing] up others \u2014\nthrough a process often called \u201cthrottling\u201d \u2014 based on the type of service or\nyour ISP\u2019s preferences.\u201d\n\nEven proposed Republican net neutrality bills prohibited ISPs from speeding up\nand slowing down apps and kinds of apps.\n\nMany, including me, thought the 2015 Order did so, too.\n\nAlmost certainly, the millions of Americans who celebrated the 2015 Open\nInternet Order and fought the 2017 repeal think that net neutrality\nprotections ban fast lanes and slow lanes.\n\nThe draft order takes a different approach.\n\nThe no-throttling rule that the FCC proposed in October explicitly prohibited\nISPs from slowing down apps and classes of apps; it was silent on whether the\nrule also applies to speeding up.\n\nGiven the mobile ISPs\u2019 public statements about their plans for 5G fast lanes,\npublic interest groups, startups, and members of Congress asked the FCC to\nclarify in the Order that the no-throttling rule also prohibits ISPs from\nspeeding up apps and classes of apps.\n\nThe draft order did not do that.\n\nWhile draft order acknowledges that some speeding up of apps could violate the\nno-throttling rule, it added some unclear, nebulous language suggesting that\nthe FCC would review any fast lanes case-by-case, without explaining how it\nwould do that.^1 This language gives the FCC maximum flexibility to accept or\nreject specific fast lanes in the future as it sees fit.\n\nAccording to the draft order, the agency \u201ccould\u201d find a violation of the no-\nthrottling rule, if:\n\n  1. an ISP speeds up specific apps (but not necessarily classes of apps), and\n\n  2. the decision to speed up is \u201cunreasonably discriminatory,\u201d and\n\n  3. the speeding up has the effect of \u201c\u2018impair[ing] or degrad[ing]\u2019 other ... apps not given the same treatment.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the proposed no-throttling rule is a bright line rule for slow\nlanes \u2013 ISPs can\u2019t slow down apps or kinds of apps; but for fast lanes, it\u2019s a\nfuzzy, unclear case-by-case standard.\n\nFor example, would it be \u201cunreasonably discriminatory\u201d to create a 5G fast\nlane that includes the most popular apps in a category since it responds to\nconsumer preferences? Does an unreasonably discriminatory fast lane need to\ntechnically degrade or impair the apps that are not in the fast lane for the\nFCC to find a violation of the no-throttling rule?\n\nThere is no way to predict which kinds of fast lanes the FCC might ultimately\nfind to violate the no-throttling rule. This gives ISPs cover to flood the\nmarket with various fast-lane offerings, arguing that their version does not\nviolate the no-throttling rule and daring the FCC to enforce its rule.\n\nAnd if the mobile ISPs do this, the cable companies will soon follow. Cable\ncompanies have the tech to build their own fast lanes, and increasingly they\ncompete with 5G to the Home services. If T-Mobile and Verizon start selling\nhome plans that have \u201cenhanced streaming video,\u201d you can bet the cable\ncompanies will launch their own version.\n\nThe FCC would then investigate these offerings case-by-case in lengthy and\ncostly proceedings. In the meantime, apps that are not in the fast lane will\nsuffer.\n\nEntrepreneurs and application providers that are not included in a fast lane\nwill have to decide whether to try to get into the fast lane, file an FCC\ncomplaint, or just silently suffer.\n\nCompanies that do file complaints will waste years litigating the meaning of\n\u201cunreasonably discriminatory,\u201d all the while going up against giant telecoms\nthat stockpile lawyers and lobbyists.\n\nUnless you are a high-paid telecom lawyer who bills by the hour, the proposed\ntest for what\u2019s a good or bad fast lane is a nightmare.\n\nNot all 5G slices are harmful.\n\nJust to be clear, net neutrality proponents are not asking the FCC to ban\nnetwork slicing. There\u2019s lots of ways for ISPs to use slices for things that\nare not normal internet service such as a dedicated slice for a farming\noperation using remote controlled tractors, slices for telemetry data and\noversight of autonomous cars, or providing a slice for a stadium\u2019s video\nsystem at a crowded game.\n\nThere are good reasons to isolate this kind of traffic, and it can be done\nwithout reducing user choice or tilting the online playing field. Under the\nFCC\u2019s draft order, such services would be so-called enterprise service\nofferings, to which the Open Internet protections don\u2019t apply.\n\nBut the 5G fast lanes ISPs are imagining for regular internet access \u2013 where\nISPs decide which apps or kind of apps get a fast lane \u2013 would cause real harm\nand violate the core tenets of net neutrality.\n\nWe don\u2019t need our ISP deciding for us what\u2019s important and what\u2019s not; we want\nour ISP to let us decide and stick to the job of connecting our devices to the\nservices we want to use.\n\nIt\u2019s not even clear why such fast lanes are necessary for consumer internet\naccess. As one industry analyst noted, isn\u2019t 5G already supposed to be the\nfast lane for everything?\n\nLuckily, there\u2019s still time to fix this.\n\nThe FCC can and should edit the draft order ahead of the vote on April 24 and\nclarify in the Order that the no-throttling rule also prohibits ISPs from\ncreating fast lanes for select apps or kinds of apps.\n\nThe FCC just needs to put this fix in the fast lane to get it done before it\nvotes on April 25.\n\n^1 2024 Draft Order, para. 492 (\u201cOur interpretation of \u201cthrottling\u201d\nencompasses a wide variety of conduct that could impair or degrade an end\nuser\u2019s ability to access content of their choosing; thus, we decline\ncommenters\u2019 request to modify the rule to explicitly include positive and\nnegative discrimination of content. We agree, however, with Free Press that a\nBIAS provider\u2019s \u201cunreasonably discriminatory\u201d decision to speed up specific\ncontent, applications, or services could \u201cimpair or degrade\u201d other content,\napplications, or services not given the same treatment.\u201d (footnotes omitted)).\n\nFocus Areas:\n\nArchitecture and Public Policy\n\nRelated Topics:\n\nNetwork Neutrality\n\n## Add new comment\n\n  * Privacy Policy\n\nBuilt by New Signature, powered by Drupal\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported\nLicense.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
