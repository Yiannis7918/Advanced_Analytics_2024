(Image credit:\nPaul Myrow, Science Advances)\n\nA major extinction in the midst of a huge expansion of life on Earth may have\nbeen driven by plate tectonics.\n\nNew research finds links between rock layers in Antarctica and Southern\nAustralia, which at the time were part of the supercontinent Gondwana. This\nsuggests that similar dynamics were occurring around the supercontinent\nroughly 513 million years ago: Mountains were uplifting, ancient reefs were\ndying, and eroded material from the continent was pouring into the sea. These\nmoments in time coincide with the extinction known as the Sinsk event, said\nstudy leader Paul Myrow, a sedimentologist at Colorado College.\n\n\"Oddly, it was tectonics that triggered an extinction,\" Myrow told Live\nScience.\n\nThe Sinsk event occurred during the Cambrian period (540 million to 485\nmillion years ago), which saw a huge diversification of life on Earth known as\nthe Cambrian explosion.\n\nBut in the middle of this flourishing, the Sinsk extinction killed off several\nmajor groups, including cone-shelled animals called hyoliths and sponges\ncalled archaeocyathids, which once built enormous reefs all over the globe.\nResearchers know that the Sinsk event was linked to falling levels of oxygen\nin the oceans, but they haven't been able to pinpoint the precise cause.\n\nRelated: The 5 mass extinction events that shaped the history of Earth \u2014 and\nthe 6th that's happening now\n\nA map showing the positions of Australia and Antarctica in the Gondwanan\nsupercontinent. (Image credit: Paul Myrow, Science Advances)\n\nNow, Myrow and his colleagues say they have the answer. The tectonics of\nGondwana, which formed between 600 million and 540 million years ago,\ntriggered a series of events that drowned the archaeocyathid reefs and altered\nthe oceans, they reported March 29 in the journal Science Advances.\n\n## Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now\n\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nThe clue to these events was found in rock layers in Antarctica\u2019s\nTransantarctic Mountains and on Kangaroo Island, Australia. Myrow and his\ncolleagues collected samples in Antarctica in 2011, including trilobite\nfossils from long-dead archaeocyathid reefs. Then, about a year ago, Pomona\nCollege geologist Robert Gaines told Myrow he'd seen similar rocks on Kangaroo\nIsland, which is also studded with fossil trilobites.\n\nThese trilobites were the key to the timing of the loss of the reefs. Because\ntrilobites evolved quickly, researchers can tell how old a rock is by the\nspecies of trilobite fossilized inside it. In both Antarctica and Australia,\nthe fossils dated to between 514 million and 512 million years ago \u2014 right\naround the time of the Sinsk event.\n\n\"Everything clicked into place,\" Myrow said. \"There was the same geologic\nhistory all the way over in Australia as there was in Antarctica.\"\n\nAt the time of the Sinsk event, both continents were part of Gondwana, with\ntoday's Antarctica sitting on the equator and Australia at a higher latitude.\nThe locations showed a similar story in the rock layers. The extinction of the\narchaeocyathid reefs coincided with giant mountain-building events. As the\nmountains popped up on land, the nearby shallow oceans right off the coast\nsubsided in a kind of seesaw motion of the crust. This caused the\narchaeocyathid reefs to suddenly deepen, submerging them past their ability to\nsurvive. Next, erosion from the new mountain ranges dumped layers of cobbles\nand gravel over the drowned reefs.\n\nMeanwhile, Myrow said, the tectonic movements that caused mountains to lift in\nsome places also caused the crust to stretch out in others, allowing magma to\nrise to the surface and harden into the rock basalt, a geologic formation\nknown as a \u201clarge igneous province.\u201d These hot magmas brought lots of\ngreenhouse gases, like sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide, causing Earth's\natmosphere to warm.\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\n\u2014Scientists just found a hidden 6th mass extinction in Earth's ancient past\n\n\u201419 'mass extinctions' had CO2 levels we're now veering toward, study warns\n\n\u2014After the 'Great Dying,' life on Earth took millions of years to recover.\nNow, scientists know why.\n\nThis warming, in turn, slowed the circulation in the ocean \u2014 a phenomenon that\nresearchers worry may happen again today with human-induced climate change.\nThis slowdown of ocean circulation led less-oxygen-rich water to sink to the\nocean bottom. This killed off many existing organisms, Myrow said.\n\n\"The older, more primitive ones didn't do so well,\" he said.\n\nLarge igneous provinces have been blamed for other extinctions, but with less\ncertainty than the Sinsk event, Myrow said, \"I don't know of any others that I\ncould point to where it's so clearly laid out.\"\n\nStephanie Pappas\n\nLive Science Contributor\n\nStephanie Pappas is a contributing writer for Live Science, covering topics\nranging from geoscience to archaeology to the human brain and behavior.
