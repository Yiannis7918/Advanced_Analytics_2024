Most recently it's switched to\na hidden USB-C connector.\n\nNow it wants to get rid of all of that.\n\nThis is the central point of the newly-revealed patent application called\n\"Photo-Sensing Enabled Display For Stylus Detection.\" There are other\nelements, though, and the whole thing is an example of how to improve one\ndevice, sometimes you have to change another one.\n\nWatch the Latest from AppleInsider TV\n\nPowered By\n\n10\n\nHow to Add Apple Wallet Loyalty Cards -- Even Unsupported Ones!\n\nShare\n\nNext\n\nStay\n\nSo the way that this future Apple Pencil can escape ever needing to be charged\nis that it will use no power. And the way that it will still be able to\nfunction is the screen you write and draw on is what will handle all of the\nwork, instead of the cooperative effort that exists now.\n\nThe patent application is about an \"optical stylus system\" that chiefly uses\nthe screen \"to determine one or more of the target or touch location,\ncentroid, hover distance, tilt angle, azimuth, and in some instances the\norientation and rotation of the stylus.\"\n\nApple even proposes adopting this technology for the MacBook Pro and Apple\nWatch\n\nApple specifically describes a passive stylus, meaning that it is basically a\ndumb stick that needs no power. Instead, it reflects light back at the iPad or\ndevice it's being used by, and the iPad does all the sensing, optically.\n\nIt says that such a stylus \"including a diffractive (patterned) reflector can\nalso reflect light emitted from the optical sensing system.\"\n\nGiven \"a consistent reflected light pattern...\" Apple proposes that different\n\"tilt angles and rotations of the stylus can generate different reflected\nlight patterns.\" Consequently, the Pencil's location and hover distance,\nperhaps also rotation, can be calculated.\n\nThe patent application then goes on to detail issues where such detection\nisn't possible, or actually when it might be more accurate than current\nsystems. It really details it, too \u2014 the patent application is 70 pages long,\nincluding 30 pages of drawings.\n\nHowever, nowhere in all of that does it look beyond the use of an Apple Pencil\nas a dumb stylus. Patent applications are concerned with how something can be\nachieved, not why, or what could then be done with the proposal.\n\nIn this case, there is a particularly obvious issue that is ignored. If a\nfuture Apple Pencil has no battery and draws no power, as detailed in this\npatent, it cannot have any features Apple has previously proposed, such as\ntouch-sensitive controls.\n\nRight now a second-generation Apple Pencil features a double-tap option, for\ninstance. You can tap, tap near the tip of the Pencil to get the iPad\napplication you're using to switch to a different tool.\n\nSimilarly, it's been reported that an Apple Pencil 3 could feature a squeeze\ngesture, or perhaps even more.\n\nIt is conceivable that an Apple Pencil without a battery could effectively\nmimic all of these options. Double-tapping on the Pencil, for instance, will\ninescapably make it move, and that movement might be quite distinctive.\n\nAs well as iPhones, Apple suggests a Pencil could be used on an antique iPod.\nThis may not be Apple's most serious suggestion.\n\nYet really they all require on-Pencil sensing and processing, and a processor\nand sensors need on-device power. So what Apple could be proposing here is a\nmore basic, entry level Apple Pencil, rather than a future replacement for the\ndevice.\n\nThen in what's possibly just a more fanciful idea, the drawings for the patent\napplication show a vastly increased use of the Apple Pencil. The drawings show\na Pencil being used on an iPhone, which might be a reference to a previously\nrumored $49 Apple Pencil for iPhone.\n\nBut the drawings also then show an Apple Pencil being used on a MacBook Pro's\nscreen, and even an Apple Watch. The patent application was filed in 2023, but\nit also includes a drawing of an Apple Pencil for iPod, the last of which were\ndiscontinued the year before.\n\nThis patent application is credited to three inventors, who are therefore\nhaving a laugh about the iPod, or are making certain their patent covers every\npossible use anyone could put it to.\n\nFollow AppleInsider on Google News\n\nWilliam Gallagher\n\nApple Historian & Senior Editor\n\nWilliam Gallagher has 30 years of experience between the BBC and AppleInsider\ndiscussing Apple technology.
