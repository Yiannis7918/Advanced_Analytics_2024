Spider-Man movies, most famously, now take place in the Spider-\nverse, in which the superhero coexists with a multiplicity of other crime-\nstopping web-slingers, each from their own distinct universes. 1\n\nWe can think of the multiverse as the hypothetical set of all possible\nuniverses. It\u2019s the kind of thing theoretical physicists take seriously, and\nsome of us might have thought about when we were kids with overactive\nimaginations. What if each time we make a decision, the universe splits into\ntwo: we continue to live in one universe and an alternative version of us,\nhaving made the different decision, spins off into a distinct alternative\nuniverse.\n\nIn the movie \u201cEverything, Everywhere...\u201d the character of Alpha Waymond,\nhailing from the Alpha universe, explains this concept to his incredulous\nwife, Evelyn, from our mundane reality:\n\n> ALPHA WAYMOND\n>\n> You underestimate how the smallest decisions can compound into significant\n> differences over a lifetime. Every tiny decision creates another branching\n> universe, another... [t]his is your universe, one bubble floating in the\n> cosmic foam of existence. Every surrounding bubble has slight variations.\n> But the further away you get from your universe, the bigger the differences.\n>\n> EVELYN\n>\n> A universe where I am finished with my taxes?\n>\n> ALPHA WAYMOND\n>\n> We are talking about infinity. If you can imagine it, somewhere out there,\n> it exists.\n>\n> EVELYN\n>\n> A universe... where I don\u2019t have any taxes?\n>\n> ALPHA WAYMOND\n>\n> Sure.\n\nHow about a multiverse where nutritionists always get exactly the answer they\nwant from their studies?\n\nAs Alpha Waymond might put it, sure.\n\nThis scenario is in fact our reality, according to a recent analysis published\nin The Journal of Clinical Epidemiology. Nutrition science, and particularly\nnutritional epidemiology, has a multiverse problem, the paper asserts, and\nit\u2019s yet another reason to be very skeptical of this research.\n\nThe analysis was the product of a collaboration led by Dena Zeraatkar of\nMcMaster University in Ontario Canada. She and her colleagues looked\nspecifically at the science on red meat and health (which I discussed in\nFebruary), but the goal was not to arrive at any conclusion about red meat.\nInstead, they aimed to investigate a potential source of uncertainty in\nnutrition science\u2014and more specifically, nutritional epidemiology. If\nreplicated, their work represents an important discovery.\n\nZeraatkar is among a small and critically important discipline of researchers\nin medicine and health who consider themselves methodologists. They identify\nand study the techniques and strategies used in research \u2013 the methods --\nidentifying potential problems and, with luck, providing viable solutions.\n\nIn an ideal world, methodologists like Zeraatkar would work hand-in-glove with\nthe researchers themselves \u2013 in this case, the nutritional epidemiologists \u2013\nto assure the scientific integrity of these studies that are, after all, so\nextraordinarily influential in shaping our ideas about healthy eating. But, as\nwe\u2019re often discussing in Unsettled Science, epidemiology and nutrition\nscience generally are far from ideal scientific worlds.\n\nThe methodologists tend to work independently \u2013 the group at McMaster, for\ninstance, or at Stanford University led by John Ioannidis, most prominently.\nWe\u2019ve seen little evidence over the years that the epidemiologists even care\nto address the issues that these methodologists have raised. (For those who\nwant to see how this plays out in reality, Ioannidis presented a\nmethodological critique of nutritional epidemiology in 2018 at the BMJ \u201cFood\nfor Thought\u201d conference in Zurich, Switzerland, and the very influential\nnutritional epidemiologist Darius Mozaffarian presented his rebuttal the next\nday. They\u2019re both worth watching.)\n\nUnsettled Science is a reader-supported publication.

The epidemiologists have never done the necessary hard\nwork to establish which of any number of strategies and techniques is reliably\ncorrect.\n\nAny analytical strategy, as Zeraatkar explained in an interview, can involve\nhundreds, if not thousands of decisions, large and small, about how best to\nconduct an analysis.2 Hence, the uncertainty in the diet-health associations\nthat these studies produce is not just about whether we can trust, for\ninstance, that the self-reported dietary data accurately reflects what people\nreally ate, but all the particular decision points made by the researchers\ndoing these analyses. A different analytic technique or different decisions\nabout how best to handle the data can produce different answers \u2013 a different\nmultiverse of answers, in effect. Use one set of criteria, and the diet or\nlifestyle factor of interest will be associated with an increased risk of a\nparticular disease; use a different set of criteria, and the reverse appears\ntrue. How do we know which is right? Which multiverse is our reality, the one\nwe\u2019re living in?\n\nZeraatkar and her colleagues were motivated to do their analysis by the\nseminal study on the multiverse problem, a 2018 report called \u201cMany Analysts,\nOne Data Set: Making Transparent How Variations in Analytic Choices Affect\nResults.\u201d Lead author, psychologist-turned-methodologist Brian Nosek, and his\ncolleagues crowdsourced the analysis of a single database to answer what\nseemed to be a simple question: In soccer (or football, for those outside the\nU.S.), are referees more inclined to give red cards for penalties committed by\nplayers with darker skin? Today we might ask, is there a problem with\nsystematic racism among soccer referees?\n\nNosek and his colleagues recruited 61 academics experienced in using\nanalytical techniques for their research (all would be co-authors), divided\nthem into 29 teams and asked them to analyze a database that contained all the\nnecessary information on players (including photos to determine skin color),\nreferees, games played, penalties committed and red or yellow cards given. As\nNosek and his colleagues reported, these professional analysts then chose to\nuse different analyses, often entirely, and got very different answers: 20\nteams found that the referees were essentially racist; 9 concluded they were\nnot.\n\nThe results, wrote Nosek and his colleagues, \u201cmake transparent how defensible,\nyet subjective, analytic choices influence research results.\u201d One obvious\nimplication was that researchers looking for publishable results could easily\nmake the decisions \u2013 consciously or subconsciously \u2013 to get the results they\nwanted, whether or not that was the correct result.3\n\nThank you for reading Unsettled Science. This post is public so feel free to\nshare it.\n\nShare\n\nZeraatkar and her colleagues took a different approach to examine the same\npotential multiverse problem. In 2019 they had published a systematic review4\nthat identified every observational study on whether red meat consumption is\nassociated with mortality: i.e., is eating red meat associated with premature\ndeath? That review had identified 15 such studies, including some of the most\nfamous cohorts in the field of nutritional epidemiology \u2013 the Nurses Health\nStudy, for instance, and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, both\nproducts of the Harvard School of Public Health.\n\nNow Zeraatkar and her colleagues identified 70 different strategies used in\nthose 15 studies to analyze the data. They then applied a technique called\nspecification curve analysis5 that used random combinations of those 70\ndifferent strategies to analyze the data from yet another epidemiological\nsurvey \u2013 the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. By doing so,\nthey could establish how the choice of strategy and the analytical decisions\nmade by the epidemiologists might influence the results. Had these nutritional\nepidemiologists made different, justifiable analytical decisions would they\nhave found themselves in entirely different multiverses?\n\nShort answer: yes.\n\nOut of 1208 possible combinations of analytic choices made in these studies,\n435 \u2013 more than one in three -- led to the conclusion that red meat\nconsumption is associated with an increased risk of premature death; the\nremaining 773 (64%) led to the opposite conclusion: the more red meat\nconsumed, the longer people lived. Only 4% of the 1208 choices were found to\nbe \u201cstatistically significant\u201d \u2013 i.e., meaningful, by the relatively loose\nstandards of nutritional epidemiology -- and of those, 83% (40 of 48) found\nred meat consumption to be benign.\n\nThe implications are disturbing: If the great majority of the justifiable\nanalytic choices led to multiverses in which red meat consumption is\nassociated with a longer life, for instance, why do nutritional\nepidemiologists keep reporting the opposite? Are they consciously or\nsubconsciously, letting their preconceptions bias their analyses?\n\nThis kind of potential group-think is less of a problem in clinical trials,\nZeraatkar notes, because the researchers have to specify in advance their\noverall analytical strategy before launching the trial and gathering any data.\nAlthough the researchers doing the clinical trials can still make numerous\nsmaller decisions about how to analyze their data that can influence their\nresults. The history of science, even in the hard sciences like physics, is\nrife with examples of researchers getting the incorrect results they expect,\nrather than what eventually turns out to be the right answer.6\n\nWorth remembering is that Zeraatkar et al\u2019s analysis doesn\u2019t actually speak to\nthe harms or benefits of eating red meat, only to the validity of these\nnutrition-health associations and the many problems with interpreting what\nthey mean. The explicit conclusion of the paper is that this kind of\n\u201cmultiverse analysis,\u201d as Zeraatkar likes to call it, is feasible. Despite the\nextra work it entails, nutrition epidemiologists should use it in the future\nto protect against their own subjective judgments and improve the credibility\nof their research.\n\n\u201cAnalytical flexibility is a major, major problem in nutrition,\u201d says\nZeraatkar. Multiverse analysis \u201cmight help with that, but of course, it\ndoesn\u2019t solve all the other problems of nutritional epidemiology.\u201d\n\nUnsettled Science is a reader-supported publication.

Zeraatkar was the first author in that review.\n\n5\n\nThe specification curve analysis is a twist on a randomized controlled trial:\nrather than randomizing participants of the study to different interventions\n(eating a lot of meat, say, or a little), which is impossible in these\nepidemiologic surveys, the technique randomizes analytic choices used -- in\nthis case, in the 15 different studies. The result is still only an\nassociation and so says nothing about causality, but it solves the problem of\nthe epidemiologists making decisions about analysis based on their biases.\n\n6\n\nHere\u2019s how the Nobel Laureate Richard Feynman describes an example, in his\nfamous commencement 1974 address on Cargo Cult Science: \u201cWe have learned a lot\nfrom experience about how to handle some of the ways we fool ourselves. One\nexample: Millikan measured the charge on an electron by an experiment with\nfalling oil drops and got an answer which we now know not to be quite right.\nIt\u2019s a little bit off, because he had the incorrect value for the viscosity of\nair. It\u2019s interesting to look at the history of measurements of the charge of\nthe electron, after Millikan. If you plot them as a function of time, you find\nthat one is a little bigger than Millikan\u2019s, and the next one\u2019s a little bit\nbigger than that, and the next one\u2019s a little bit bigger than that, until\nfinally they settle down to a number which is higher. Why didn\u2019t they discover\nthat the new number was higher right away? It\u2019s a thing that scientists are\nashamed of\u2014this history\u2014because it\u2019s apparent that people did things like\nthis: When they got a number that was too high above Millikan\u2019s, they thought\nsomething must be wrong\u2014and they would look for and find a reason why\nsomething might be wrong. When they got a number closer to Millikan\u2019s value\nthey didn\u2019t look so hard. And so they eliminated the numbers that were too far\noff, and did other things like that.\u201d\n\n### Subscribe to Unsettled Science\n\nThousands of paid subscribers\n\nWhy it's hard to get trustworthy advice on nutrition & health\n\n81 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n5 Restacks\n\n81\n\nShare this post\n\n#### No End to Parallel Universes in Nutrition\n\nunsettledscience.substack.com\n\n4\n\nShare\n\n4 Comments\n\nChef Dr. MIkeApr 10Interestingly, professor and theoretical physicist John\nWheeler commented on this many years ago when looking at how the researcher's\nbias and experimental design can determine the outcome of an experiment. He\nreferenced the famous double-slit experiment of quantum physics. Depending on\nhow the experiment is set up, the result is either an interference pattern\nsuggesting that the nature of light is wave-like or a result that suggests the\nnature of light is composed of discrete particles. Furthermore, the results\ncannot be determined until the researcher commits to their method of\nobservation; in other words, light is both a particle and a wave until the\nresearcher commits to an observation method and records the result. This\narticle was a great refresher in reminding us that HOW we observe (and\nsubsequently choose to analyze those observations) goes a long way toward\ndetermining the results.
