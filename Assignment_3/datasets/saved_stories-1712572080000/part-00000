What is noteworthy is how they\nmanaged to reduce the number of chips necessary over time.\n\nLooking at a summary table may seem like it is a daunting task to make sense\nof all of it.\n\nNTSC Motherboards| 1990| 1991| 1992| 1993| 1994| 1995| 1996| 1997  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nSHVC-CPU-01  \nSNS-CPU-GPM-01  \nSNS-CPU-GPM-02  \nSNS-CPU-RGB-01  \nSNS-CPU-RGB-02  \nSNS-CPU-APU-01  \nSNS-CPU-1CHIP-01  \nSNS-CPU-1CHIP-02  \nSNS-CPU-1CHIP-03  \nSNN-CPU-01  \nPAL Motherboards| 1990| 1991| 1992| 1993| 1994| 1995| 1996| 1997  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nSNSP-CPU-01  \nSNSP-CPU-1CHIP-01  \nSNN-CPU-01  \n  \nIt is actually not that hard since most of the changes were minor updates.\nThere were only four major generation named Classic (\u25a0), APU (\u25a0), 1-CHIP (\u25a0),\nand Junior (\u25a0).\n\nClassic\n\nThe original Super Nintendo from 1990-1992 had a lot of chips inside. Count\nthem and you will find fifteen.\n\nThe cartridge slot divides the system in two. Above are the sound system\nprocessors and RAM^[2]^[3]:\n\n  * U10: OpAmp (LM358)\n  * U11: Measure against erroneous issues at power on/off (T529D)\n  * U13: Audio Processor: S-SMP (Sony SPC-700)\n  * U14: Audio DSP: S-DSP\n  * U15, Audio ARAM 32KiB SRAM (MCM51L832F10)\n  * U17: Audio D/A Converter: NEC PD6376\n  * U18: Audio Panasonic Operational Amplifiers\n\nBelow the cartridge slot are the CPU/PPU sub-systems and their RAM:\n\n  * U1: S-CPU (Ricoh 5A22)\n  * U2: S-PPU1\n  * U3: S-PPU2\n  * U4: PPU RAM: 32KiB SRAM (Victronix NV44256S-10LL)\n  * U5: PPU RAM: 32KiB SRAM (Victronix NV44256S-10LL)\n  * U6: CPU S-WRAM: 128 KiB SRAM\n  * U7: RGB Encoder (BA6592F S-ENC). Converts RGB into S-Video and Composite\n  * U8: CIC Copy-protection (F411A)\n  * U9: Reset / CIC circuit: (74HCU04)\n\nNotice in U12, this is not a chip but a +5V Regulator (7805). This little guy\nis present on every version of the SNES.\n\nAPU\n\nThe APU version of the SNES brings down the chip total to twelve. This version\nis also sometimes referenced as \"3-CHIP\".\n\nThe Nintendo developer documentation mentioned a logical Audio Processing\nUnit^[4], made of a S-SMP chip and a DSP chip. With this version, the two are\nfused into an actual chip labeled \"APU\".\n\nTop part (audio):\n\n  * U7: S-RGB (BA6592F), Converts RGB into S-Video and Composite\n  * U10: Sound mixer (S-MIX)\n  * U13: ASIC APU (S-SMP + S-DSP)\n  * U14: DAC (6379a)\n\nBottom part (cpu + graphics):\n\n  * U1: S-CPU (Ricoh 5A22)\n  * U2: S-PPU1\n  * U3: S-PPU2\n  * U4: PPU RAM: 32KiB SRAM\n  * U5: PPU RAM: 32KiB SRAM\n  * U6: CPU S-WRAM: 128 KiB SRAM\n  * U7: RGB Encoder (SEC)\n  * U8: CIC\n  * U9: Reset / CIC circuit\n\nNotice the oscillator (left of red thingy in X1) and resonator (blue thingy in\nX2) we studied last week. There two will be the only unchanged components\nthrough the whole console lifetime.\n\n1-CHIP\n\nWith the 1-CHIP version, Nintendo took a giant step forward to fuse the CPU\nand the two PPU into a single ASIC. This motherboard brings down the total\nnumber of chips to nine.\n\nTop part (audio):\n\n  * U2: ASIC APU (S-SMP + S-DSP)\n  * U6: DAC (6379a)\n  * U7: S-RGB (BA6592F), Converts RGB into S-Video and Composite\n  * U10: Sound mixer (S-MIX)\n\nBottom part (audio):\n\n  * U1: ASIC with CPU + PPU1 + PPU2\n  * U3: CPU S-WRAM: 128 KiB SRAM\n  * U4: VRAM 32KiB\n  * U5: VRAM 32KiB\n  * U8: CIC (F411B)\n\nThe red thingy is gone, the red variable capacitor is likely moved to the back\nof the mobo.\n\nJr\n\nThe Super Nintendo Jr (also called Mini) is the final form of the SNES. Only\nnine chips remain. The top and bottom part no longer are dedicated to a\nspecific sub-system.\n\nTop part:\n\n  * U6: Audio D/A Converter: 6379A\n  * U7: S-RGB\n  * U8: CIC\n  * U10: S-MIX\n\nBottom part:\n\n  * U1: ASIC with CPU + PPU1 + PPU2\n  * U2: ASIC APU with S-SMP + S-DSP\n  * U3: S-WRAM\n  * U4: VRAM 32KiB\n  * U5: VRAM 32KiB\n\nNotice how the blue resonator (in X2) has managed to survive all this. So did\nthe oscillator (in X1).\n\nWhich one was the best?\n\nThe retro community has established guidelines^[5]^[6] to help enthusiasts buy\nthe right console for themselves. From failure rate to video output quality,\neverything is detailed on consolemods.org SNES Wiki.\n\nReferences\n\n^| [1]| Introduced in 1991 in Japan, last produced in 2003.  \n---|---|---  \n^| [2]| SNES motherboards chips reference  \n^| [3]| SNES & N64 Video Encoder Information/Datasheets  \n^| [4]| SNES Development Manual, fig 2-22-1  \n^| [5]| SNES Buying Guide  \n^| [6]| SNES Model Differences  \n  \n*\n\n", "frontpage": false}
