It's gotten some positive press recently,\nironically right after I made my blog post about why I no longer liked or\ntrusted it. This blog post was called \"Why I Lost Faith In Kagi\" and was a\npretty simple quick collection of my thoughts that I primarily wrote so it'd\nbe easier to find again later to link to people when discussing Kagi versus\nmaking it a fedi thread I couldn't search for easily later. Across the four\nsocial media platforms I linked this blog post on, I'd say it got a total of\nabout 40 likes and few reblogs.\n\nhttps://d-shoot.net/kagi.html\n\nI say this because this morning I woke up to an email from Kagi's CEO, Vlad,\nwho had seen the post and was upset about it. I have an email address listed\non my blog (which is why I didn't bother removing it from these logs), which\nis what he sent his emails to. I am posting this entire email chain in this\nthread and will briefly post my thoughts about it, but I feel like it's\nsomething that needs to be seen. Please take note of the subject of the email\nas well (EDIT: It got cropped out sorry, the subject is \"Fatih [sic] can not\nbe lost\"). Also, since the alt text would get extremely long with some of the\ntranscripts, I've provided a text dump of the emails here for screen reader\nusers and will offer a more abridged description in the alt text:\nhttps://d-shoot.net/files/kagiemails.txt\n\nALT\n\nALT\n\nALT\n\nALT\n\nApr 11, 2024, 23:16 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 314 \u00b7 263\n\nlori@lori\n\nEN\n\nContinuing the email chain: (edit: looks like an image got duplicated here\nsorry, the full text in the first post in the thread would probably be easier\nto read anyway)\n\nALT\n\nALT\n\nALT\n\nALT\n\n17h *\n\nlori@lori\n\nEN\n\nLast bit (as of now):\n\nALT\n\nALT\n\n17h\n\nlori@lori\n\nEN\n\nMy reaction to all of this has been pretty straightforward:\n\n1) If there's one thing I know about online interactions, it's not to let\nsomeone take you to Crime Scene Number Two. Having a private debate with Vlad\nabout this would mean no witnesses and no accountability, meaning he could\nclaim anything about the discussion. Even moreso when done through a call\ninstead of text.\n\n2) I repeatedly told Vlad I would not engage with him and he continued to come\nat me, increasingly so even\n\n3) This is the CEO of a company getting extremely twisted up because one\nnobody posted a blog post that barely got any engagement or shares that said\nthey didn't trust him or his company.\n\n4) This subject line that implies...what, that this can be fixed? \"Fatih (sic)\ncan not be lost\"? It's a bizarre thing to start with.\n\n17h\n\nlori@lori\n\nEN\n\nBased on the type of posting I do, you may think to yourself \"so, you're going\nto go through his rebuttal post, right?\"\n\nBut no, I'm not. Because, as I told him, I'm not debating this with him. And\nthat includes not debating his points away from him either. I'm not engaging\nwith this bullshit, because I explicitly told him I wouldn't be and he vomited\nit out at me anyway. He does not deserve it. And frankly, 90% of it isn't even\nsaying I'm wrong.\n\n17h\n\nlori@lori\n\nEN\n\nI think this is petty and sad behavior from the CEO of a company and I think\nthis is a man that does not understand boundaries at ALL.\n\nAnd you know what I truly believe? I already thought this before based on\nseeing his responses to feedback, but I believe it a thousand times more now\nthat I've been on the receiving end: I think it genuinely eats him alive that\nsomeone doesn't agree with him or doesn't think he's doing great work, and he\nalso truly believes that if he can just keep explaining himself to them\nthey'll OBVIOUSLY see it his way. He cannot accept that someone might think\nKagi sucks, to the point where he has to reach out to someone like me to try\nto argue them into Thinking Correctly.\n\n17h\n\nlori@lori\n\nEN\n\nAnyway, unless I get anything else in my inbox that's it, but I think it's\nsuch absolutely unhinged behavior that people should know about it. I don't\nwant to hear a single other fucker tell me \"but the search is good!\" Use that\nline on literally anyone else but me, no other search CEO has shown up in my\nemail inbox to mansplain their company to me.\n\n17h\n\nlori@lori\n\nEN\n\nJust for some perspective, if you want to know how little reach the fedi post\nwith the link to this blog post got: the first post in this thread already has\nmore likes and boosts after less than a hour since posting it than my blog\npost ever did that he felt the need to confront me over.\n\n17h\n\njack@JackEric@strangeobject.space\n\nEN\n\n@lori I don't understand why he'd email you... surely he could just send his\nquery to a chatbot and ask it to tell him what your reply would be?\n\n6h\n\nmilas@milas@notaphish.fyi\n\nEN\n\n@lori \"Harassed via email by CEO\" is irrefutable, I'd say\n\n15h\n\nbigiain@bigiain@aus.social\n\nEN\n\nThis is gold: \u201c no other search CEO has shown up in my email inbox to\nmansplain their company to me.\u201d\n\nhttps://hackers.town/@lori/112255132348604770\n\n@lori\n\n9h\n\nMichael@fincham@cloudisland.nz\n\nEN\n\n@lori hey when I closed my trial account with them aaagggess ago and said it\nwas because I didn\u2019t realise they were so keen on AI bullshit I got a similar\ne-mail from Vlad! I didn\u2019t bother to reply, seems like that was the right\nchocie\n\n7h\n\nlori@lori\n\nEN\n\n@fincham God that's amazing, I can't say I'm shocked (or shocked by the one I\ngot) because I've seen him in discord trying to debate people into thinking\nthey should give him money. He can't even tolerate \"I don't think this fits in\nmy budget\"\n\n6h\n\n0xC0DEC0DE07E8@c0dec0dec0de@hachyderm.io\n\nEN\n\n@lori @fincham if you are waiting in line to be harassed by the Kagi CEO for\nnot liking his product, STAY IN LINE. He will get around to emailing you!\n\n5h *\n\nLnklnx @bgardner@mastodon.sdf.org\n\nEN\n\n@lori I'd been a Kagi subscriber for a bit, but I eventually soured on all the\nAI bullshit and walked away. Sounds like I made the right call.\n\n5h\n\nRiver @River@derg.social\n\n@lori@hackers.town honestly, pushing for a call gives me infamous \"business\nthe Russian way\" vibes, where criticism is a threat and you would never start\nyour letter with \"hi lori, i'm Vlad, and as a CEO of Kagi I would like to\nthank you for the time you've taken to write the blog article...\"\n\n5h\n\nReina @Reina@antabaka.me\n\nEN\n\n@lori His response is so fuckinh hilarious because it's basically just \"I\ndon't believe [thing you wrote]. Let me explain. What I believe is [thing you\nwrote but phrased differently]\"\n\nDoes he not realise that none of the things he said refuted your points? He\njust repeated you while pretending to disagree ...\n\nThis is what he's been doing in everything I've seen from him too. He thinks\nthat explaining himself multiple times will make people somehow change their\nmind. But people aren't misunderstanding him, they're disagreeing with him.\nFundamentally.\n\nAlso, like, why does he even bother responding to everything? Is that just all\nhe does every day? xD\n\nI already disliked him for his \"technology is apolitical\" stance, but now I\ndislike him even more. Fuck him.\n\n2h\n\nlori@lori\n\nEN\n\n@Reina This is honestly a common thing I saw in Reddit comments. \"If you\ndisagree with me it must be that I'm not explaining my point clearly enough,\nbecause it's impossible that you actually think I'm wrong\"\n\n2h\n\nJonbjohns@Jonbjohns@idlethumbs.social\n\nEN\n\n@Reina\n\nI'd be curious if this response thread is the same he gives others that\ndisagree\n\n1h\n\nReina @Reina@antabaka.me\n\nEN\n\n@Jonbjohns Not entirely sure what you mean, but if what you meant is if he\ndoes this same kind of thing to others as well, then the answer is yes. I've\nseen him talk in the forums doing the exact same tactic. Instead of arguing\nagainst others, he'll just state his own opinions again but in a different\nway, because his opinion is obviously correct, so surely he just has to repeat\nhimself enough until everyone else gets it too /s\n\n23m\n\nJack William Bell@jackwilliambell@rustedneuron.com\n\nEN\n\n@lori\n\nThis appears to be your first experience dealing with a narcissist. This is\nhow they roll. And, yea, it probably does eat him alive to think someone would\nnot love his company and, by extension, him.\n\nHopefully he's the run-of-the-mill type. Because if he's a malignant\nnarcissist he may not stop until he feels you have been properly punished for\nyour lack of faith.\n\n(I know this territory well; I've worked for several of them and had a\nmalignant narcissist parent.)\n\n15h\n\nlori@lori\n\nEN\n\n@jackwilliambell sorry but no, not my first time dealing with a Vlad and\nwasn't even totally shocked about this Vlad doing this\n\n14h\n\nJack William Bell@jackwilliambell@rustedneuron.com\n\nEN\n\n@lori\n\nThey *are* terribly common in tech industry C-Suites.\n\nAnd when I say that I don't just mean people with narcissistic and selfish\npersonalities; there are a lot of those everywhere. I mean people with the\nactual mental disorder. And it isn't common in the general population at all;\nless than 1 in 200 people fit the DSM-5 diagnosis. (Malignant narcissists are\noften diagnosed as psychopaths.)\n\nThey are also over-represented in the medical field and the military. No\nsurprises there!\n\n14h\n\n{proper_name} deilann {very_surname}@deilann@tech.lgbt\n\nEN\n\n@lori this is tommy tallarico levels of response\n\n17h\n\nlori@lori\n\nEN\n\n@deilann YOU ARE NOT WRONG\n\n17h\n\n{proper_name} deilann {very_surname}@deilann@tech.lgbt\n\nEN\n\n@lori\n\nif the CEO of Google or Microsoft wanted to clarify things to you you'd sit\ndown and talk to them (tommy tallarico voice)\n\n17h\n\nrixx@rixx@chaos.social\n\nEN\n\n@lori @deilann Do you think Vlad's mother is very proud of him tho\n\n6h\n\n{proper_name} deilann {very_surname}@deilann@tech.lgbt\n\nEN\n\n@rixx @lori\n\nhow many guinness world records does vlad have\n\n4h\n\nBen S.@HunterZ@mastodon.sdf.org\n\nEN\n\n@lori I'm not owned! I'm not owned!\n\n15h\n\nslow learner, deep feeler@melanie@queer.party\n\nEN\n\n@lori I'm writing to say that I admire your response so much. The second crime\nscene boundary, your direct communication style, making the whole thing\npublic, thank you for modeling such great boundaries.\n\n10h\n\nAnna@venite@mastodon.nl\n\nEN\n\n@melanie @lori seconded, this is an education!\n\nAnd... they started their own physical t-shirt printing business? To give away\nmerch? That\u2019s wild.\n\n9h\n\nlori@lori\n\nEN\n\n@venite @melanie in a different country! They had to set up a legal entity in\na whole other country to print tshirts! I hope this is some kind of money\nlaundering scam because otherwise what the hell are you DOING\n\nAnd the shirts don't even have their logo on them and they're giving the\n20,000 shirts away for free\n\n6h\n\nAnna@venite@mastodon.nl\n\nEN\n\n@lori @melanie I thought one of my previous employers had it bad when they\ndecided to build their own Java framework because they disliked one (1) thing\nabout Spring. This is a class of their own.\n\n6h\n\nfunnymonkey@funnymonkey@freeradical.zone\n\nEN\n\n@lori I love how tax compliance was too hard to implement, but starting a new\nseparate tshirt printing business was totally in scope and achievable. @venite\n@melanie\n\n5h\n\nAnna@venite@mastodon.nl\n\nEN\n\n@funnymonkey Both are such obvious signs that they think building in-house\nfrom scratch is the only solution. And that\u2019s a pretty big blind spot to have.\n@lori @melanie\n\n5h\n\nLeona@Lionesslady@mindly.social\n\nEN\n\n@funnymonkey @lori @venite @melanie re: creating t-shirt company vs\nimplementing tax compliance - - YES omg. I hadn't put the weirdness clear in\nmy head until you pointed that out. So, so much of A Choice.\n\n2h\n\nlori@lori\n\nEN\n\n@melanie I've dealt with this type of guy before, if you try to debate them\nthey just feel rewarded for their behavior, the best thing you can do is give\nthem nothing. Then if they keep insisting on yelling at you it's clear that\nthis was never a discussion, they're just ranting at random strangers. They\nhave nothing to twist the story with later, but you have a lot of proof of\nthem being boundary crossers later.\n\n6h\n\nmagic@daisy55@eldritch.cafe\n\nEN\n\n@lori yo i saw you say \u201chey don\u2019t email me\u201d and then noticed i still had like\nhalf the page to scroll through and it\u2019s almost all another email to you???\n\ntf?\n\n16h\n\nlori@lori\n\nEN\n\n@daisy55 Every single reply I made to him told him I didn't want to talk to\nhim about it lmao and his replies got longer and longer\n\nI went ahead and posted this because I stopped getting replies but I'm worried\nI'm going to wake up tomorrow and find out it's because it took him hours to\ndraft a 500 page reply next\n\n16h\n\nmagic@daisy55@eldritch.cafe\n\nEN\n\n@lori \u201ci must explain to this person why they are wrong, but first i must\nexplain why they do, in fact, want to hear from me.\u201d\n\n16h\n\nlori@lori\n\nEN\n\n@daisy55 \"i mostly have issues iwth people not wanting to listen to what i\nhave to say\" YEAH NO SHIT BUDDY I CAN SEE THAT\n\n16h\n\nmagic@daisy55@eldritch.cafe\n\nEN\n\n@lori wait did he actually say this omg i haven\u2019t actually read his whole\nreply yet because i am eating but that\u2019s self parody\n\n16h\n\nlori@lori\n\nEN\n\n@daisy55 this is an exact quote lmao\n\n16h\n\nlori@lori\n\nEN\n\n@daisy55 including the typo\n\n16h\n\nsadmac356@sadmac356@restless.systems\n\nEN\n\n@lori @daisy55 my god TECH PEOPLE LEARN TO UNDERSTAND CONSENT CHALLENGE\n(impossible)\n\n16h\n\nmagic@daisy55@eldritch.cafe\n\nEN\n\n@sadmac356 @lori sorry, consent is a bug we\u2019re still trying to squash\n\n16h\n\nsadmac356@sadmac356@restless.systems\n\nEN\n\n@daisy55 @lori sure seems that way...I hate it\n\n15h\n\ndiametric so electric@dexiheart@laserdisc.party\n\nEN\n\n@lori this dude is a straight up moron like lmfaooooooooo\n\n16h\n\nlori@lori\n\nEN\n\n@dexiheart you just don't understand his VISION, which is exactly what i\ndescribed it as being except with a more positive attitude about it >:(\n\n16h\n\ndiametric so electric@dexiheart@laserdisc.party\n\nEN\n\n@lori the moment he started about sales tax made me think \"... does this man\nnot know what sales tax is????? like at all???????\"\n\n16h\n\nlori@lori\n\nEN\n\n@dexiheart lmao again i don't wanna get into Rebuttals here but I have posted\nthis about kagi's financials before so I'll restate it: they talked about how\nthey hadn't been paying sales tax they DID owe, so it's not like they JUST\nstarted having to pay it, they needed to before and just never did until now\n\n16h\n\nExplore\n\nLogin to follow profiles or hashtags, favorite, share and reply to posts.
