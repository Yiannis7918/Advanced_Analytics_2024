Police are hopeful of developing their own AI tools to help eliminate child abuse material.\n\nIt takes less than one minute, with the help of a few prompts into an\nartificial intelligence (AI) image generator, to create a photo depicting a\nchild in a sexually explicit way.\n\nLess than one minute.\n\nWarning: This article contains details that readers may find distressing.\n\nIt's one of the latest online threats that law enforcement agencies fear will\nonly increase.\n\n\"We do anticipate this increasing, very much so,\" said Detective\nSuperintendent Frank Rayner from the Australian Centre To Counter Child\nExploitation (ACCCE).\n\n\"The tools that people can access online to create and modify using AI are\nexpanding and they're becoming more sophisticated as well.\n\n\"You can jump onto a web browser and enter your prompts in and do text-to-\nimage or text-to-video and have a result in minutes.\"\n\nAI image generators have advanced at a startling pace and grown in\nsophistication in the past year or two.\n\nMainstream image generators such as Microsoft's Copilot have protections built\ninto them to stop sensitive or harmful images being generated.\n\nBut this is not the case for every AI tool.\n\nAs an example of their sophistication, the following two images were all\ngenerated by Copilot in just a few seconds with just a simple prompt.\n\nAn AI-generated image from the prompt, \"two people chatting in a\ncafe\".(Supplied: Microsoft Copilot)\n\nAn AI-generated image from the prompt, \"an Australian police officer sits at a\ncomputer and works on an AI image generator\".(Supplied: Microsoft Copilot)\n\n## Tasmanian man jailed over AI-generated material\n\n## Sexual assault support lines:\n\n  * 1800 Respect National Helpline: 1800 737 732\n  * Men's Referral Service: 1300 766 491\n  * Lifeline (24-hour crisis line): 131 114\n  * Victims of Crime Helpline: 1800 819 817\n  * Full Stop Australia: 1800 385 578\n\nLast month, a Tasmanian man was jailed for two years for uploading and\ndownloading child abuse material generated by AI. It is believed to be the\nfirst case of its kind in the state.\n\nThe 48-year-old from Gravelly Beach in Tasmania's north pleaded guilty to\npossessing and accessing child abuse material.\n\nA joint team of Australian Federal Police and Tasmania Police officers opened\nan investigation after receiving multiple reports that an Australian-based\nuser was saving and downloading child abuse material from a website and social\nmedia platform.\n\nDetective Superintendent Frank Rayner has been investigating reports of AI-\ngenerated content since 2022.(Supplied)\n\nIt was in 2022 that Detective Superintendent Rayner first received reports of\nchild exploitation material circulating online that had been generated by AI\ntools.\n\nBefore moving to the ACCCE, which was set up in 2018, Detective Superintendent\nRayner worked for 25 years as a police officer.\n\nOver 12 months, the ACCCE received 40,232 reports of child sexual exploitation\nand charged 186 offenders with 925 child exploitation-related offences last\nfinancial year.\n\nDetective Superintendent Rayner said reports had been steadily increasing.\n\n\"And in the last calendar year we've received near to 49,500 reports,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"It's obviously very concerning for us here, and law enforcement not only\nlocally but throughout the world.\"\n\nThe ACCCE said each report contains images and videos of children being\nsexually assaulted or exploited for the sexual gratification of child sex\noffenders.\n\nImages can be generated easily using artificial intelligence.(ABC News: Paul\nYeomans)\n\n## The search for real child victims vs AI\n\nSpecialist victim identification teams work to identify the victims in photos.\n\nIt is a laborious job, and has been made harder with AI generating such\nrealistic images.\n\n### Inside the police unit unmasking child predators\n\nFor the parents behind the Australian Federal Police's Victim Identification\nTeam, disconnecting from the office takes on an entirely different meaning.\nBut they say without careful effort, they would risk becoming \"very unwell\nvery quickly\".\n\nRead more\n\n\"Our fear is that if our teams are looking at material and we can't tell if\nit's AI-generated or a real-life person, then obviously we're devoting a lot\nof time to try to identify the victim and work out who they are and where they\nare,\" Detective Superintendent Rayner said.\n\n\"That's time taken away from looking at real victims.\"\n\nTasmania's Commissioner for Children and Young People, Leanne McLean, said it\ndid not matter whether a child depicted in child abuse material was real or\nAI-generated.\n\nLeanne McLean says all child abuse material is abhorrent, regardless of\nwhether the children depicted are real or AI-generated.(ABC News: Luke Bowden)\n\n\"Producing, sharing, consuming, tolerating or excusing any child abuse\nmaterial \u2014 regardless of whether it is real or generated through AI \u2014 is\nabhorrent,\" Ms McLean said.\n\n\"It's incredibly concerning; any material that denigrates any group in our\ncommunity is harmful.\n\n\"Its very presence in our community is sending a terrible, terrible message to\nchildren and young people about how we value them ... it's completely\nunacceptable.\"\n\nMs McLean said she predicted fighting the production of child exploitation\nmaterial online through AI would be the next battle for child protection\nglobally.\n\n\"Despite the many merits of AI for our society, its power and its ease of use,\n[it] means that the production of child exploitation material is made easier,\"\nshe said.\n\n\"The speed at which technology is developing means that it is a race between\nthose trying to uphold the law and protect the vulnerable, and those\nexploiting technology and harming people.\"\n\n## Offenders can be prosecuted over generated images\n\nIt can take less than a minute to create a sexually explicit image of a child\nusing artificial intelligence tools.(ABC News: Paul Yeomans)\n\nDetective Superintendent Rayner said people can be charged with child abuse\nmaterial offences, regardless of whether an image of a child is of a real\nchild or not.\n\nHe said the Criminal Code defined very clearly what child exploitation\nmaterial was.\n\n\"It includes things like animations, cartoons, fantasy, even text-based\nmaterial that relates to child abuse can constitute abuse material under the\nact,\" he said.\n\n## Abusers using 'fake' images as blackmail\n\nWeProtect Global Alliance is a coalition of more than 100 governments, 70\ncompanies and dozens of advocacy groups that have come together to try and\nstamp out online child exploitation material being made and shared.\n\nThe organisation's head of policy, advocacy and research, Shailey Hingorani,\nsaid there were tools that abusers were using to blackmail young people.\n\nShailey Hingorani says abusers are using AI tools to blackmail young\npeople.(Supplied: Shailey Hingorani)\n\n\"There is an app where you can upload a fairly innocuous photo from a social\nmedia site, and you can modify it and then use it as a threat to try and get\nreal images from children,\" Ms Hingorani said.\n\nThe app can modify the photo so the person appears to be nude.\n\n\"And they're saying it doesn't matter that you haven't sent me any sexual\nimagery because I can generate it on my own using generative AI and release it\nto your friends,\" Ms Hingoran said.\n\nShe said it was having extremely negative impacts and had resulted in a small\nnumber of young people taking their own lives.\n\nMs Hingoran said AI was giving abusers the ability to abuse at a scale and in\na way where grooming conversations could be tailored to a child's specific\ntastes and their needs.\n\n\"The ability to produce these conversations and this type of content in\nseconds ... is so absolutely shocking,\" she said.\n\n## AI also being used to help police\n\nDetective Superintendent Rayner said police were hoping to develop AI tools to\nhelp them.\n\n### How families can protect their kids from online predators\n\nThere are two questions sexual predators ask children when they are grooming\nthem online.\n\nRead more\n\n\"It's obviously early days, but we would hope we can develop AI tools that\ncould potentially help us in terms categorising this material and potentially\nlessen the amount of material that individual officers have to go through,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"We are committed to developing the tools in a transparent and ethical way and\nit's something that many law enforcement agencies are dealing with.\n\n\"So it's potentially a tool that could help law enforcement agencies as well.\"\n\nIn September last year, the AFP launched the My Pictures Matter campaign.\n\nIt asked everyday Australians to submit a photo of them as a child, which was\nthen to be uploaded into an AI tool so it could learn what was a photo of a\nnormal child in a normal childhood setting.\n\nIt is hoped that explicit images will be able to be fed into the tool and, as\nit learns, it will be able to say whether a child is real or not, and make it\neasier for police to lay charges.\n\n### More Tasmanian storiesCarousel\n\nMove cancelled\n\n### UTAS Law School confirms it won't move from Sandy Bay campus into Hobart's\nCBD\n\nThe
