As a result of this strike, a\n33-year-old man and a 71-year-old woman were wounded.\n\nThen, at 1:55 a.m., two more drones struck the city, killing the three\nEmergency Response workers who were called to the scene following the first\nattack: 52-year-old Vladyslav Lohinov, 32-year-old Serhii Baidalinov, and\n41-year-old Volodymyr Matiushenko.\n\nAccording to local police, a 69-year-old civilian woman was also killed.\n\nIn total, 12 individuals were reported injured as a result of the drone\nstrikes, including an Emergency Service worker, a policeman, and a nurse.\n\nThree high-rise buildings, three firetrucks, a hospital building, and two\nambulances were damaged in the attacks.\n\nSeparate attacks on Kharkiv Oblast on April 3 injured a 55-year-old woman as\nwell as a 70-year-old man.\n\nSettlements in Ukraine\u2019s Kharkiv Oblast are subjected to near-daily attacks by\nRussian forces due to their proximity to the border with Russia.\n\nState Emergency Service: Russian double-tap attacks have killed 91 first\nresponders, injured 348\n\nMost recently, Russian forces used such a tactic in a drone attack against\nKharkiv overnight on April 4, killing three State Emergency Service employees:\n52-year-old Vladyslav Lohinov, 32-year-old Serhii Baidalinov, and 41-year-old\nVolodymyr Matiushenko.\n\nThe Kyiv IndependentMartin Fornusek\n\n## SBU: Russian forces used cyberattack to target Ukraine's 128th brigade\n\nThe Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said on April 4 that it uncovered\nevidence that Russian forces were able to hack into the devices of military\npersonnel in order to guide a missile to strike the 128th Mountain Assault\nBrigade, killing at least 19 Ukrainian soldiers, in November last year.\n\nMembers of the 128th brigade were gathered for an award ceremony in honor of\nArtillery Day on Nov. 3, 2023, in the front-line zone of Zaporizhzhia Oblast\nwhen a Russian Iskander-M missile struck the group.\n\nThe brigade later confirmed that 19 of its soldiers had been killed in the\nattack.\n\nA preliminary investigation found that reports of Russian reconnaissance\ndrones operating in the area, including an air alert, were ignored.\n\nIn addition, the soldiers were gathered in the yard of a house, with 10 cars\nparked outside, which was plainly visible from above.\n\nIn the weeks following the attack, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said that\n\"all rules of disguise were ignored.\"\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky promised to implement changes in the armed forces\nto address negligence, Soviet-era practices, and bureaucracy.\n\nSBU cybersecurity chief Illia Vitiuk said in an interview on April 4 that\nRussian soldiers sent phishing messages to hack the messenger applications of\nspecific military personnel. When they managed to \"crack\" the device, they got\naccess to messengers and computers through mail.\n\nAccording to the SBU official, the investigation found that one of the devices\non which the Signal messenger was installed received a message about the\nspecific date and place of the formation of servicemen. The Russian missile\nlater struck this exact location.\n\nVitiuk also announced that up to 30 soldiers had been killed in the attack,\ndespite official reports that only 19 service members died.\n\nSBU: Ukraine gathers evidence for ICC on Russian GRU hackers behind Kyivstar\ncyberattack\n\nThe SBU linked the attack to SandWorm, which is reportedly \u201ca full-time unit\u201d\nof Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency, the GRU.\n\nThe Kyiv IndependentMartin Fornusek\n\n## German FM says Berlin will initiate search for more air defense for Ukraine\n\nBerlin will call on allies worldwide to examine their air defense capabilities\nand \"to provide whatever we all can\" to Ukraine, Germany's Foreign Minister\nAnnalena Baerbock said after a NATO-Ukraine Council meeting in Brussels on\nApril 4.\n\nAs Russia intensified its attacks on Ukraine during the spring, the shortage\nof air defense systems in Ukrainian cities and villages became more tangible.\n\nAccording to President Volodymyr Zelensky, Russia launched over 400 missiles\nof various types, 600 Shahed drones, and 3,000 guided aerial bombs at Ukraine\nin March, causing severe damage to the civilian and energy infrastructure.\n\n\"We see what's happening in Ukraine, we realize that you need air defense now\nbecause it's now that schoolchildren really have to be in safety, that in\nOdesa the port has to be protected,\" Baerbock said in a joint video address\nwith Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba.\n\n\"We will call on Europe again that everybody has to check where their air\ndefense is, what they can provide for Ukraine, but also have this pledge\nworldwide, arrange the funding. Because we definitely know: every day, every\nmonth counts, and it's not only words, it's action that matters now for you in\nUkraine.\"\n\nIn December last year, Germany delivered the second Patriot air defense system\nto Ukraine.\n\nAt the April 4 meeting, Kuleba called on partners to supply Ukraine with\nadditional Patriot air defense systems that are vital in protecting Ukraine's\nairspace, as they have proven effective even against advanced Russian\nballistics such as Kinzhal missiles.\n\n\"It is impossible to understand why the allies cannot find additional\nbatteries to take them to places where ballistic missiles are fired every\nday,\" said Kuleba, as cited by the Foreign Ministry's press service.\n\n\"In March alone, 94 ballistic missiles were launched at Ukraine. On average,\nthree per day. This does not happen anywhere else in the world.\"\n\nKuleba previously told Reuters that Ukraine's partners had more than 100\nPatriot systems at their disposal, but they did not want to share at least\nfive or seven of them \u2013 the minimum required number to significantly improve\nadditional protection, according to Kyiv's calculations.\n\nThe minister also met with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, urging\nWashington \"to find ways to provide additional Patriot air defense systems as\nsoon as possible.\"\n\n\"I am grateful to the Secretary for taking action right away to reciprocate\nthis call. We also discussed next steps in the coming days and weeks to unlock\nsupplemental U.S. aid for Ukraine,\" Kuleba said on X.\n\nAir defense ammunition has been dwindling recently as $60 billion in U.S. aid\nremains effectively blocked in Congress by political disputes. The American\nmedia wrote that Ukraine may soon be forced to \"ration\" its air defense\nmissiles, targeting only one out of every five enemy projectiles.\n\nMedia: German companies involved in Russian \u2018reconstruction\u2019 of occupied\nMariupol\n\nGerman companies Knauf and WKB Systems GmbH are involved in the so-called\nrestoration efforts of occupied Mariupol in Donetsk Oblast, which was\ndestroyed by Russian troops, according to an investigation published on April\n3 by journalists of the Monitor program of the German TV channel ARD.\n\nThe Kyiv IndependentKateryna Denisova\n\n## Energoatom: Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant 'on verge of blackout' after recent\nRussian attack\n\nAn external overhead line that supplies power from Ukraine's energy grid to\nthe Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in the city of Enerhodar\nwas disconnected on April 4 after Russian attacks, the state nuclear energy\nagency Energoatom said.\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, the largest nuclear plant in Europe, has\nbeen under Russian occupation since March 2022.\n\nThroughout its occupation, the plant has been repeatedly disconnected from the\nUkrainian power grid due to Russian attacks on the country's energy\ninfrastructure.\n\nAs of April 4, the plant is connected to Ukraine's energy system only by one\npower line, which was recently restored. This situation \"threatens to cause an\nemergency,\" Energoatom said.\n\n\"If this last line of communication with the national power grid is\ndisconnected, the plant will be on the verge of another blackout, which is a\nserious violation of the conditions for its safe operation,\" the statement\nread.\n\nBefore Russia's full-scale war, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant had six\nbackup lines and four main lines of 750 kV.\n\nThe six reactors at the Russian-occupied plant are currently shut down, but\nthe facility's front-line position puts it at risk. International Atomic\nEnergy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Grossi has warned that heavy\nfighting near the plant poses serious threats to nuclear safety.\n\nUkrenergo: Russia targeted solar power plant in Ukraine\u2019s rear for the first\ntime\n\nRussian forces carried out a targeted attack on a solar power plant in\nUkraine\u2019s rear for the first time since the beginning of the full-scale\ninvasion, Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, the head of Ukraine\u2019s state grid operator\nUkrenergo, said at a press conference on April 4.\n\nThe Kyiv IndependentKateryna Denisova\n\n## Poll: Fewer than 50% of Ukrainians believe war will end with restoration of\n1991 borders\n\nOnly 45% of Ukrainians said they believe the war will end with Ukraine\nrestoring its 1991 borders, the Ukrainian media outlet NV reported on April 4,\nciting a poll conducted by the International Republican Institute (IRI).\n\nKyiv has vowed to liberate all of the territories occupied by Russia,\nincluding Crimea. Previous polls have indicated that an overwhelming majority\nof Ukrainians are opposed to territorial concessions in exchange for peace.\n\nAccording to the IRI poll, the 45% still represented a plurality.\n\nTied for second place at 16% were two options: Ukraine would regain all of the\nterritory it held up to the beginning of the full-scale war (excluding Crimea\nand parts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts occupied since 2014), and that Russia\nwould gain some additional territories.\n\nThe 45% of respondents who believed that Ukraine would regain all of its\nterritory represented a decrease from a high point in February 2023, in which\n74% of respondents believed it was possible.\n\nThere was also a generational divide present in the most recent poll, with\nyounger people ages 18-35 less likely (37%) to believe the 1991 borders would\nbe restored, compared to those 51+, 52% of whom believed it was possible.\n\nDespite the less-than-optimistic results, 39% of respondents still said that\nthe restoration of 1991 borders was one of the most important goals of the\nwar.\n\nNV wrote that the survey was conducted throughout Ukraine, excluding\nterritories occupied by Russia.\n\nUkrainian man sentenced to life in prison for role in helping target attack on\nKramatorsk cafe that killed 13\n\nThe well-known writer Victoria Amelina was among those killed in the strike.\n\nThe Kyiv IndependentNate Ostiller\n\nAuthor: The Kyiv Independent news desk\n\nSupport independent journalism in Ukraine.
