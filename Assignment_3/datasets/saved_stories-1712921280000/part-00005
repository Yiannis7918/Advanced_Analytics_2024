No reproduction without permission. (Cowboy State Daily Staff)\n\nUPDATE, April 8, 2024: Director Says Wyoming Game And Fish Not Hiding Anything\nIn Wolf Torment Case\n\nCowboy State Daily has obtained a photo of a wolf that was captured and had\nits mouth taped shut while it was reportedly taken to a local man\u2019s house and\na bar in rural Daniel, Wyoming, before it was killed.\n\nThe photo shows the wolf with red tape wound tightly around its muzzle sitting\nand looking down while Cody Roberts of Daniel poses with the animal in his\nhouse. They are on a tile floor with coats and other clothing hanging behind\nthem.\n\nThe photo, provided exclusively to Cowboy State Daily, confirms some of the\nreports about a Wyoming man who captured a live wolf and showed it off around\ntown before killing it.\n\nThe story has sparked outrage throughout Wyoming\u2019s outdoors and wildlife\ncommunity, along with anger from animal rights groups calling for harsher\npunishment for the man, who was cited by the Wyoming Game and Fish Department\nfor having the wolf.\n\n'Sickened'\n\nRob Wallace, who oversaw the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National\nPark Service as the Assistant Secretary for the Interior under the Trump\nadministration, said he was \u201csickened\u201d by the photo, which Cowboy State Daily\nshared with him Saturday morning.\n\n\u201cThis is awful,\u201d Wallace said from his Teton County home. \u201cWyoming represents\nthe best in wildlife stewardship and this is a sad and disgusting outlier.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn no way do I believe this represents who we are as a state,\u201d he added.\n\nWallace has been around the wolf issue for decades. He served as the\ngovernor\u2019s chief of staff when wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone back in\n1995.\n\n## Hit With A Snowmobile\n\nThe story began Feb. 29 when a man reportedly ran down the wolf with a\nsnowmobile, disabling it.\n\nInstead of killing the animal on the spot, he kept the wolf and took it back\nto his home, then to the bar, before finally taking it out behind the bar and\nkilling it.\n\nThe Wyoming Game and Fish Department verified that somebody has been cited and\nfined for being in possession of a live wolf, but didn\u2019t release that person\u2019s\nname, the name of the investigating game warden or any exact details of the\ncase.\n\nSublette County Circuit Court records, however, show that local resident Cody\nRoberts, 42, was cited for a wildlife violation stemming from an incident that\nday, Feb. 29, and that Adam Hymas was the investigating agent.\n\nGame and Fish spokeswoman Breanna Ball sent Cowboy State Daily a statement\nabout the case via email Tuesday.\n\n\u201cAn anonymous reporting party notified the Wyoming Game and Fish Department\nthat an individual was alleged to be in possession of a live wolf. The\nreporting party notified the Department on March 1, 2024. According to the\ninvestigation, the individual possessed the live wolf on 2/29/24,\u201d according\nto the statement.\n\n\u201cThe individual was hunting when he came across the wolf in the predator zone\nand intended to harvest it. However, the wolf was transported alive back to\nhis residence and later to a business in Daniel, WY. The individual euthanized\nthe wolf later that day. The individual was cited for violating Chapter 10,\nImportation and Possession of Live Warm-Blooded Wildlife,\u201d according to Game\nand Fish.\n\nCited for possessing a live wolf, the Roberts was fined $250, a penalty Game\nand Fish has confirmed is the only violation the agency has the power to\nenforce.\n\nBecause killing a wolf in one of Wyoming\u2019s \u201cpredator zones\u201d is legal, that\nmeans they may be killed at any time, without a bag limit and no hunting tags\nrequired.\n\n## Call For More Charges\n\nThat regulation also makes the mistreatment of this wolf not illegal under\nWyoming\u2019s laws. While people can be charged with cruelty to animals, that only\napplies to pets and domestic animals, not predators like wolves.\n\nEven so, there has been a loud and emotional outcry to charge Roberts for\ncruelty, including a pair of animal rights groups lobbying Sublette County\nofficials to level harsher penalties in the case.\n\nBut it\u2019s unclear whether any further charges could be filed under Wyoming\nstatutes, Sublette County Attorney Clayton Melinkovich told Cowboy State Daily\non Friday.\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, no documents from a law enforcement agency calling for\nfurther charges in the case had come across his desk, he said.\n\nIn their letter, Animal Wellness Action and the Center for a Humane Economy\nwrite: \u201cRoberts\u2019 actions clearly warrant a punishment more severe than the\n$250 ticket he received for possession of live wildlife \u2014 such an anemic\nresponse on the part of law enforcement will be seen by some as tacit approval\nof his crime and can only motivate other like-minded individuals driven by\nhatred of wolves to engage in similar, repugnant behavior.\u201d\n\nEven if he wanted to, Melinkovich said he can\u2019t act on his own.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t do anything independently on my own until something comes to me from\na peace officer,\u201d Melincovich said.\n\nIf and when such documents are sent to his office, Melincovich said he could\nmake a determination whether to file charges.\n\nGreg Johnson can be reached at: Greg@CowboyStateDaily.com\n\n## In case you missed it\n\n### Why A Cheyenne Credit Union Didn\u2019t Cash Woman\u2019s $1 Million Check\n\nClair McFarland6 min read\n\n### Guest Column: Innocent Beings Should Never Be Tortured Or Killed -- Period\n\nCSD Staff4 min read\n\nShare this article\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nEnvelope\n\n## Authors\n\n### Greg Johnson\n\n#### Managing Editor\n\nVeteran Wyoming journalist Greg Johnson is managing editor for Cowboy State\nDaily.\n\nView Profile\n\n### Mark Heinz\n\n#### Outdoors Reporter\n\nView Profile\n\n## More in Outdoors\n\n### Disturbing Video Released By Game And Fish Shows Tortured Wyoming Wolf\n\nMark HeinzApril 11, 2024\n\n### Advocacy Groups Could Use Wolf Torment To Push For Re-Listing Wolves\n\nMark HeinzApril 10, 2024\n\n### Investigation Could Lead To More Charges For Accused Wyoming Wolf\nTormentor\n\nMark HeinzApril 10, 2024\n\n### Wyoming Wolf Abuser Could Get Hunting Privileges Taken Away\n\nMark HeinzApril 09, 2024\n\n## Most read\n\n  1. ### Why A Cheyenne Credit Union Didn\u2019t Cash Woman\u2019s $1 Million Check\n\nClair McFarlandApril 12, 2024\n\n  2. ### Casper Coin Shop Owner Accused Of Faking Theft Of $100,000 Collection\n\nDale KillingbeckApril 11, 2024\n\n  3. ### Wyoming Department Of Health Gives $3,000 For Annual Drag Show; Freedom Caucus Livid\n\nClair McFarlandApril 11, 2024\n\n  4. ### Disturbing Video Released By Game And Fish Shows Tortured Wyoming Wolf\n\nMark HeinzApril 11, 2024\n\n  5. ### Public Officials, Law Agencies Flooded With Threats Over Reports Of Wolf Torture\n\nClair McFarlandApril 10, 2024\n\n  6. ### Investigation Could Lead To More Charges For Accused Wyoming Wolf Tormentor\n\nMark HeinzApril 10, 2024\n\nSign-up to our newsletter to stay in touch with our latest newsSubscribe to\nour NewsletterArrow right\n\n  * FacebookFacebook\n\n  * TwitterTwitter\n\n  * InstagramInstagram\n\n  * LinkedInLinkedIn\n\nAs your #1 Wyoming News Source our mission is to provide you high quality\nstatewide and local news for Wyoming.
