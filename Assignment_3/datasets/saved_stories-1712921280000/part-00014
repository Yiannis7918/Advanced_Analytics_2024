It occurs when they seek\nexternal technologies for their business or external markets for their own\ntechnologies. It has implications for the value of technology and innovations\nas well as their development by more than one firm, and for the need for and\nlimitations of patent protection.\n\nArrow's information paradox theory was set out in a 1962 article by K. J.\nArrow.^[3] Cornell Law School professor Oskar Liivak has written in a paper\nfor a conference at Stanford University that Arrow's article \"has been one of\nthe foundational theoretical pillars of the incentive based theory of patents\nas Arrow\u2019s work is thought to rule out a strictly market-based solution\".^[4]\n\nA fundamental tenet of the paradox is that the customer, i.e. the potential\npurchaser of the information describing a technology (or other information\nhaving some value, such as facts), wants to know the technology and what it\ndoes in sufficient detail as to understand its capabilities or have\ninformation about the facts or products to decide whether or not to buy\nit.^[5]^[6] Once the customer has this detailed knowledge, however, the seller\nhas in effect transferred the technology to the customer without any\ncompensation.^[2] This has been argued to show the need for patent\nprotection.^[4]\n\nIf the buyer trusts the seller or is protected via contract, then they only\nneed to know the results that the technology will provide, along with any\ncaveats for its usage in a given context.^[7] A problem is that sellers lie,\nthey may be mistaken, one or both sides overlook side consequences for usage\nin a given context, or some unknown unknown affects the actual outcome.\n\nDiscussions of the value of patent rights have taken Arrow's information\nparadox into account in their evaluations.^[8] The theory has been the basis\nfor many later economic studies.^[9] These include theories that pre-patent\ninnovation can be carried out only by a single firm.^[10]^[11]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Arrow's impossibility theorem\n  * Non-disclosure agreement\n  * Zero-knowledge proof\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Piazza, Mario; Pedicini, Marco (2017-01-31).
