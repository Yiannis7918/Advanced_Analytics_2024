I feel this with every core of my\nbeing,\u201d she told the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on the\nConstitution and Limited Government.\n\nHerridge, who most recently worked for CBS News, was held in contempt of court\nfor refusing to divulge sources for her reporting during her time at Fox News.\nShe is facing a fine of $800 every day that she does not burn her sources,\nalthough the penalty is stayed while she appeals.\n\n\u201cForcing a reporter to disclose confidential sources would have a crippling\neffect on investigative journalism,\u201d said Herridge, later adding that \u201cIf you\ncannot offer a source a promise of confidentiality as a journalist, your\ntoolbox is empty.\u201d\n\nAlthough Herridge said she \u201chas not lost a night\u2019s sleep about my decision to\nprotect my confidential sources,\u201d she noted that one of her children had asked\nher whether she was going to go to jail, and whether they were going to lose\ntheir home and savings, all because she refused to renege on her promises to\nher sources. \u201cI wanted to answer that in this United States, ... it was\nimpossible, but I could not offer that assurance,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI hope that I am the last journalist that has to spend two years in the\nfederal courts fighting to protect my confidential sources,\u201d Herridge\nproclaimed. \u201cIf confidential sources are not protected, I fear investigative\njournalism is dead.\u201d\n\nThe PRESS Act passed the House unanimously and with broad bipartisan\nsponsorship in January, and representatives from Jim Jordan to Jerry Nadler\nreiterated their support for the bill at today\u2019s hearing. It\u2019s now pending in\nthe Senate, with strong bipartisan support in that chamber as well, but it\nneeds to clear the Senate Judiciary Committee to further advance.\n\nThe highest-ranking senators from both parties that sit on that committee,\nDick Durbin and Lindsey Graham, are both sponsors of the bill. Senate Majority\nLeader Chuck Schumer recently told the New York Post that he\u2019d like to see the\nbill on the president\u2019s desk this year.\n\nOther witnesses at today\u2019s hearing also testified powerfully in favor of the\nPRESS Act. Nadine Farid Johnson, policy director of the Knight First Amendment\nInstitute at Columbia University, explained that \u201cModern newsgathering\nrequires that reporters are able to give assurances of confidentiality to\ntheir sources.\u201d She noted that the Supreme Court had \u201cinvited\u201d Congress in\n1972 to pass a law protecting journalist-source confidentiality and encouraged\nit to finally do so.\n\nLike Herridge, Farid Johnson emphasized the PRESS Act\u2019s broad definition of\n\u201cjournalist,\u201d explaining that \u201cin the digital age, a significant amount of\nimportant reporting is done by journalists who do not fit a traditional mold,\u201d\nand that journalists must be protected \u201cwhether writing for The Washington\nPost or offering a subscription on Substack.\u201d\n\nJournalist Sharyl Attkisson added that \u201ccountless news stories that I broke or\nfacets of them could not have been reported without sources whose identities\nneeded to be protected.\u201d She added that \u201cthere\u2019s no way to quantify with any\ncertainty the impact of what we\u2019ve lost and what we\u2019re not able to do\u201d without\nadequate protection for journalist-source confidentiality. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think\nthere are many investigative reporters who would say it isn\u2019t having a big\nimpact.\u201d\n\nMary Cavallaro, chief broadcast officer, SAG-AFTRA News & Broadcast\nDepartment, also endorsed the PRESS Act. \u201cThis long-overdue legislation\nrepresents a significant leap forward not just for journalists, but for the\nsanctity of journalism itself, and for the constitutional right to freedom of\nthe press,\u201d she said.\n\nHerridge noted in her testimony that the PRESS Act is supported by numerous\npress freedom and civil liberties organizations, including Freedom of the\nPress Foundation (FPF).\n\nSeth Stern, FPF\u2019s Advocacy Director, said: \u201cThe PRESS Act is the most\nimportant press freedom legislation in modern times. It\u2019s truly remarkable\nthat, despite all the political divisions in Congress, legislators from both\nparties proudly support the PRESS Act. We hope that senators in both parties\ntake the testimony of Catherine Herridge and others to heart and advance this\ncrucial legislation without further delay.\u201d\n\n## Donate to support press freedom\n\nYour support is more important than ever.\n\nDonate now\n\nFreedom of the Press Foundation\n\n49 Flatbush Avenue #1017 Brooklyn NY 11217\n\n  * Home\n  * Contact Us\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * About Freedom of the Press\n\n  * Guides & Training\n  * Projects\n  * News & Advocacy\n  * Press Releases\n  * Newsletters\n\nThis work licensed under a Creative Commons 4.0 Attribution International\nLicense\n\n  * News & Advocacy\n  * Guides & Training\n  * Projects\n\n  * Donate\n  * Store\n  * Jobs\n  * Contact\n  * About\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * Mastodon\n\n", "frontpage": false}
