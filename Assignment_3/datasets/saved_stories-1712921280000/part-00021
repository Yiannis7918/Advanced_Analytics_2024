I simply want the hard working employees\nto be paid as per the norms,\u201d says Vijay Gopal when asked about the whole\nordeal. He told HRKatha that he intends to pursue this case until the \u2018illegal\npolicies\u201d are changed.\n\nGopal is a renowned Right to Information (RTI) activist who has been quite\nvocal about this issue since 2018. He was an L5 operations manager, when he\nreceived a termination letter from the Company on November 27, 2020, with\nimmediate effect. The letter formalised his termination under the clause 12.1\nof his contract with Amazon. He was paid one month\u2019s salary with a month\u2019s\nnotice.\n\nVijay Gopal\n\n> \u201cI am not looking to be reinstated. I simply want the hard working employees\n> to be paid as per the norms.\u201d\n\nIn 2019, Gopal, in his complaint to Telangana\u2019s Department of Labour, penned\ndown that the Company was clearly violating laws of the Shops & Establishments\nAct, 1988. The hearing of his complaint was taken up on October 22.\n\nHe further alleged that employees working overtime \u2014 over 48 hours to be\nprecise \u2014 were not being paid for the extra hours. According to him, employees\nare made to work for nine hours per day, whereas during hiring the contract\nreads 40 hours per week, including lunch break. The truth is that it goes up\nto 45 hours per week, minus the compensation! Employees are asked to work up\nto 20 extra hours per week, and the Company claims that it has authorisation\nfrom the government for the same.\n\nThe Company had tried to justify that its calculations of work hours for its\nemployees is in alignment with government regulations, excluding the breaks.\nThis goes against the rules of the Department of Labour, which states that the\nweekly hours\u2019 calculation should include breaks.\n\nGopal\u2019s RTI revealed that the Company\u2019s claims were wrong, because the Law\ndoes not exempt anyone as far as overtime for employees is concerned. The\nmaximum legal limit remains 6 hours per week.\n\n### Comment on the Article Cancel reply\n\nValue our content... contribute towards our growth.
