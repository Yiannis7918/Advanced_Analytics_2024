At right in a provided\nexclusively to Cowboy State Daily, a wolf with red tape wound tightly around\nits muzzle looks down as Cody Roberts of Daniel, Wyoming, poses with it. No\nreproduction without permission. (Cowboy State Daily Staff)\n\nSince reports broke of a wolf being captured, tormented and killed in and\naround the tiny western Wyoming town of Daniel, there has been international\noutcry for stiffer penalties in the case \u2014 and those may be coming.\n\nThe Sublette County Sheriff\u2019s Office on Wednesday afternoon issued a statement\nthat it\u2019s working with the Sublette County Attorney and the Wyoming Game and\nFish Department to investigate the allegations that have sparked a flood of\nangry and highly charged responses from around the globe.\n\nBecause it\u2019s an \u201cactive investigation,\u201d the statement didn\u2019t contain any\nspecific details about the case, or the names of any person or people who may\nbe under investigation.\n\nGame and Fish previously stated that a person had been fined $250 for illegal\npossession of live wolf, but didn\u2019t identify that person.\n\nSublette County Court records indicate that Cody Roberts, 42, of Daniel, was\nfined for that offense. Roberts also has been identified as the man in a photo\nobtained and published by Cowboy State Daily pictured posing with a young wolf\nthat had its muzzle taped shut.\n\n## Worldwide Rage\n\nAccording to accounts of events in Sublette County on Feb. 29, Roberts\nallegedly ran the wolf down with a snowmobile and captured it. He then\nallegedly took it to his home, and then showed it off at a local bar in Daniel\nbefore taking out behind the bar and killing it.\n\nThe photo and story have since gone viral across the country and around the\nworld, causing widespread livid reactions and calls for Roberts to face\npenalties beyond the $250 fine.\n\n## More Charges Could Be In The Works\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s investigation could mean that stiffer penalties are forthcoming\nin the case, as previously explained by experts to Cowboy State Daily.\n\nSublette County Attorney Clayton Melinkovich said it wasn\u2019t certain whether\nanimal cruelty charges could be brought to bear in the case.\n\nBut, he could consider filing such charges if an investigation by \u201ca peace\nofficer\u201d requested that he do so. And peace officers could include sheriff\u2019s\ndeputies or Game and Fish wardens.\n\nRetried federal game warden Tim Eicher of Cody also told Cowboy State Daily\nthat a sheriff\u2019s investigation could possibly lead to a revocation of hunting\nprivileges in cases such as the alleged wolf torment.\n\n## Attention Prompted Investigation\n\nThe sheer volume of attention to the case might have prompted the\ninvestigation, according to the sheriff\u2019s office statement.\n\n\u201cThe Sheriff\u2019s Office did not receive any complaints from the public until\nnews of the incident went viral early last week,\u201d the statement says. \u201cWyoming\nGame and Fish was the agency who handled the initial investigation, and\nrightfully so, as this involved wildlife.\n\n\u201cOur office, along with the Sublette County Attorney\u2019s Office, are working\nwith Wyoming Game and Fish to gather evidence and information relevant to the\ncase.\u201d\n\nMark Heinz can be reached at mark@cowboystatedaily.com.\n\n## In case you missed it\n\n### Casper Coin Shop Owner Accused Of Faking Theft Of $100,000 Collection\n\nDale Killingbeck6 min read\n\n### Chuck Gray Spearheads Effort For Guns In State Capitol, Other State\nBuildings\n\nLeo Wolfson8 min read\n\nShare this article\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nEnvelope\n\n## Authors\n\n### Mark Heinz\n\n#### Outdoors Reporter\n\nView Profile\n\n## More in Outdoors\n\n### Disturbing Video Released By Game And Fish Shows Tortured Wyoming Wolf\n\nMark HeinzApril 11, 2024\n\n### Advocacy Groups Could Use Wolf Torment To Push For Re-Listing Wolves\n\nMark HeinzApril 10, 2024\n\n### Wyoming Wolf Abuser Could Get Hunting Privileges Taken Away\n\nMark HeinzApril 09, 2024\n\n### Wyoming Men With Same Name As Alleged Wolf Tormentor Get Death Threats\n\nMark HeinzApril 08, 2024\n\n## Most read\n\n  1. ### Why A Cheyenne Credit Union Didn\u2019t Cash Woman\u2019s $1 Million Check\n\nClair McFarlandApril 12, 2024\n\n  2. ### Casper Coin Shop Owner Accused Of Faking Theft Of $100,000 Collection\n\nDale KillingbeckApril 11, 2024\n\n  3. ### Wyoming Department Of Health Gives $3,000 For Annual Drag Show; Freedom Caucus Livid\n\nClair McFarlandApril 11, 2024\n\n  4. ### Disturbing Video Released By Game And Fish Shows Tortured Wyoming Wolf\n\nMark HeinzApril 11, 2024\n\n  5. ### Public Officials, Law Agencies Flooded With Threats Over Reports Of Wolf Torture\n\nClair McFarlandApril 10, 2024\n\nSign-up to our newsletter to stay in touch with our latest newsSubscribe to\nour NewsletterArrow right\n\n  * FacebookFacebook\n\n  * TwitterTwitter\n\n  * InstagramInstagram\n\n  * LinkedInLinkedIn\n\nAs your #1 Wyoming News Source our mission is to provide you high quality\nstatewide and local news for Wyoming.
