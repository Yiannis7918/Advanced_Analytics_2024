It's a PCAP-based tool\nthat allows you to specify an extended regular or hexadecimal expression to\nmatch against data payloads of packets. It understands many kinds of\nprotocols, including IPv4/6, TCP, UDP, ICMPv4/6, IGMP and Raw, across a wide\nvariety of interface types, and understands BPF filter logic in the same\nfashion as more common packet sniffing tools, such as tcpdump and snoop.\n\n## What's New\n\n  * Fix \"no VLAN support for XXX\"-related problems\n  * Fix truncated/garbled output (e.g. SIP over SLL/Linux cooked sockets)\n  * Change exit behavior to match BSD & GNU grep (see manpage)\n  * Add Solaris IPnet support\n  * Update to use 32bit values where relevant\n  * Emit frame # in header, useful for reference/analysis\n  * Emit total received, matched upon exit (dropped unreliable PCAP stats)\n  * Import debian patches related to autotools, manpage, and compilation on other platforms\n  * Fix build clean/distclean when not linked against provided GNU regex\n  * Fix build --enable/--disable flag processing\n  * Fix building under MS VS2012 / Win32\n  * Update to latest autotools (2017)\n\n## How to use\n\nngrep was originally developed to:\n\n  * debug plaintext protocol interactions such as HTTP, IMAP, DNS, SIP, etc.\n  * identify and analyze anomalous network communications such as those between malware, zombies and viruses\n  * store, read and reprocess pcap dump files while looking for specific data patterns\n\nAs well, it could be used to do plaintext credential collection, as with HTTP\nBasic Authentication, FTP or POP3 authentication. Like all useful tools, it\ncan be used for good and for bad.\n\nVisit EXAMPLES to learn more about how ngrep works and can be leveraged to see\nall sorts of neat things.\n\n## Support, Feedback, & Patches\n\nIf you need help, have constructive feedback, or would like to submit a patch,\nplease visit ngrep's project at GitHub and use the online tools there. It will\nhelp the author better manage the various requests and patches so that nothing\nis lost or missed (as has been the case in the past, unfortunately).\n\n  * Issues: https://github.com/jpr5/ngrep/issues\n  * Patches: https://github.com/jpr5/ngrep/pulls\n\n## Confirmed Working Platforms\n\n  * Linux 2.0+ (RH6+, SuSE, TurboLinux, Debian, Gentoo, Ubuntu, Mandrake, Slackware)/x86, RedHat/alpha Cobalt, (Qube2) Linux/MIPS\n  * Solaris 2.5.1, 2.6/SPARC, Solaris 7, Solaris 8/SPARC, Solaris 9/SPARC\n  * FreeBSD 2.2.5, 3.1, 3.2, 3.4-RC, 3.4-RELEASE, 4.0, 5.0\n  * OpenBSD 2.4 (after upgrading pcap from 0.2), 2.9, 3.0, 3.1+\n  * NetBSD 1.5/SPARC\n  * Digital Unix V4.0D (OSF/1), Tru64 5.0, Tru64 5.1A\n  * HPUX 11\n  * IRIX\n  * AIX 4.3.3.0/PowerPC\n  * BeOS R5\n  * Mac OS X 10+\n  * GNU HURD\n  * Windows 95, 98, NT, 2000, XP, 2003/x86, 7, 8, 8.1, 10\n\n## Miscellany\n\nPlease see CREDITS for a partial list of the many people who helped make ngrep\nwhat it is today.
