According\nto my very rough calculations, this would correspond to a BAC in the range of\n0.12\u20130.14 for a 73kg human. The paper concludes\n\n> ...modest alcohol consumption inhibits aspects of creativity based mainly on\n> the secondary process (preparation, certain parts of illumination, and\n> verification), and disinhibits those based mainly on the primary process\n> (incubation, certain parts of illumination, and restitution).\n\nIn other words, moderate alcohol consumption does improve certain types of\ncreative thinking, while inhibiting other types of creative thinking. Since\nthe skills required for computer programming are solely cognitive in nature\n(discounting the motor skills required to type, of course), and given that\ncreativity is a large part of computer programming, it is at least plausible\nthat one might gain some amount of improvement from alcohol consumption.\n\nThere have also been studies on the relationship between alcohol consumption\nand creative output. That study examined 34 well known, heavy drinking, 20^th\ncentury writers, artists, and composers/performers. It concludes:\n\n> Analysis of this information yielded a number of interesting findings.\n> Alcohol use proved detrimental to productivity in over 75% of the sample,\n> especially in the latter phases of their drinking careers. However, it\n> appeared to provide direct benefit for about 9% of the sample, indirect\n> benefit for 50% and no appreciable effect for 40% at different times in\n> their lives. Creative activity, conversely, can also affect drinking\n> behavior, leading, for instance, to increased alcohol consumption in over\n> 30% of the sample. Because of the complexities of this relationship, no\n> simplistic conclusions are possible.\n\nSo for a small portion of people there was a notable increase in creative\noutput as a result of alcohol intake. It does appear that the study did not\ncontrol for the quantity of alcohol intake, though, so this may not be\ndirectly applicable to the Ballmer Peak.\n\nThe best study I was able to find on the subject was by Lapp, Collins, and\nIzzo. They gave subjects vodka tonics of varying strengths (by varying the\nratio of tonic to vodka), some of which did not even contain any alcohol. The\nsubjects believed that they were drinking a standard-strength vodka tonic. The\nsubjects then were asked to perform a number of cognitively and creatively\nchallenging tasks. Here is what they conclude:\n\n> The present results support the idea that creative people probably gain\n> inspriation from consuming alcohol ..., but show that this effect may be due\n> to the expected rather than the pharmacological effects of the drug. ... A\n> convergence of evidence supported the idea that creativity is enhanced (at\n> least in some aspects) by the expected effects of alcohol.\n\nIn other words, alcohol can improve certain aspects of one's cognitive\nability, but this effect is not likely due to any pharmacological process\n(i.e., it is often sufficient to merely believe that one is drinking alcohol\nin order to achieve the same benefit).\n\nAnd remember: The Ballmer Peak, as it is currently understood, is but a two\ndimensional projection of what in reality is a higher dimensional space, vi&.,\n\n;-)\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 3.0\n\nImprove this answer\n\nFollow this answer to receive notifications\n\nedited Jun 4, 2016 at 1:59\n\nonzinsky\n\n10522 bronze badges\n\nanswered May 4, 2011 at 21:18\n\nESultanikESultanik\n\n8,05833 gold badges3939 silver badges4949 bronze badges\n\n8\n\n  * 39\n\n+1 for esoteric joke no-one will get. -1 for original research. :-)\n\n\u2013 Oddthinking \u2666\n\nJun 7, 2011 at 2:04\n\n  * 1\n\nmoderate alcohol consumption (1.0ml/kg body weight) There is no time given.\nPer day?

What's dubious is that\nthere is no mention of whether or not the quicker answers overall were more\nlikely to be correct or not. If you give 7 solutions in 10 minutes while sober\nwith 71% of them correct and 18 solutions in 9 minutes when intoxicated with\n50% correct, then you technically solve more problems correctly in a shorter\ntime, but I wouldn't say it improved creativity, just impulsivity.\n\n\u2013 Jim\n\nJul 7, 2017 at 13:33\n\nAdd a comment |\n\nThis answer is useful\n\n6\n\nSave this answer.\n\nShow activity on this post.\n\nIf we think about driving a car, it is generally agreed that there is no\nalcohol level at which one is a better driver than when one is sober.

With programming, there is always a chance to take a program that\ndoesn't compile and go back over it. Furthermore, the claim is more along the\nlines that you try solutions in programming you'd not have considered when\nsober. This means one can implement a broad solution, which may have plenty of\nminor errors due to intoxication, but be able to fix the errors when sober\nagain while maintaining the novel overall solution you otherwise wouldn't have\n\n\u2013 Jim\n\nJul 7, 2017 at 13:37\n\nAdd a comment |\n\nThis answer is useful\n\n-2\n\nSave this answer.\n\nShow activity on this post.\n\nThe Observer reports on a study showing it is real.\n\n> A recent study at the University of Illinois tested the creative problem\n> solving ability of a group of men who were given vodka cranberry and snacks\n> and asked to solve brain teasers.
