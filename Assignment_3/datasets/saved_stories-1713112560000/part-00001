Expect bugs and changes. Do\nnot use it as the only way to store your photos and videos!\n\n# Introduction\n\n## Welcome!\n\nHello, I am glad you are here.\n\nMy name is Alex. I am an Electrical Engineer by schooling, then turned into a\nSoftware Engineer by trade and the pure love of problem solving.\n\nWe were lying in bed with our newborn, and my wife said, \"We are starting to\naccumulate a lot of photos and videos of our baby, and I don't want to pay for\nApp-Which-Must-Not-Be-Named anymore. You always want to build something for\nme, so why don't you build me an app which can do that?\"\n\nThat was how the idea started to grow in my head. After that, I began to find\nexisting solutions in the self-hosting space with similar backup functionality\nand the performance level of the App-Which-Must-Not-Be-Named. I found that the\ncurrent solutions mainly focus on the gallery-type application. However, I\nwant a simple-to-use backup tool with a native mobile app that can view photos\nand videos efficiently. So I set sail on this journey as a hungry engineer on\nthe hunt.\n\nAnother motivation that pushed me to deliver my execution of the App-Which-\nMust-Not-Be-Named alternative or replacement is for contributing back to the\nopen source community that I have greatly benefited from over the years.\n\nI'm proud to share this creation with you, which values privacy, memories, and\nthe joy of looking back at those moments in an easy-to-use and friendly\ninterface.\n\nIf you like the application or it helps you in some way, please consider\nsupporting the project. It will help me to continue to develop and maintain\nthe application.\n\nEdit this page\n\nLast updated on Apr 14, 2024 by renovate[bot]\n\nOverview\n\n  * Welcome\n  * Installation\n\nCommunity\n\n  * Discord\n\nLinks\n\n  * GitHub\n\nImmich is available as open source under the terms of the GNU AGPL v3 License.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
