The police officers would arrest Indigenous people, who were usually\nmale, for alleged drunkenness and/or disorderly behaviour, sometimes without\ncause.^[2] The officers would then drive them to the outskirts of the city at\nnight in the winter, and abandon them, leaving them stranded in sub-zero\ntemperatures.^[3]\n\nThe practice is known as taking Indigenous people for \"starlight tours\"^[4]\nand dates back to at least 1976.^[5] As of 2021, despite convictions for\nrelated offences, no police officer has been convicted specifically for having\ncaused freezing deaths.\n\n## Incidents[edit]\n\nVictims who died from hypothermia include Rodney Naistus, Lawrence Wegner, and\nNeil Stonechild. Naistus and Wegner died in 2000, and their bodies were\ndiscovered on the outskirts of Saskatoon. Inquests in 2001 and 2002 into their\ndeaths determined they were due to hypothermia. The inquest jury's\nrecommendations all related to police policies and indigenous-police\nrelations.^[6] Neil Stonechild's body was found on November 29, 1990, in a\nfield outside Saskatoon, which had led to an Inquiry Into Matters Relating to\nthe Death of Neil Stonechild.^[7]^[8] On the night of Stonechild's\ndisappearance, five days prior on November 24, 1990, the temperature reached\n\u221228.1 \u00b0C (\u221218.6 \u00b0F).^[9] The 2003 inquest could not determine the\ncircumstances that led to his death.^[10]^[11]\n\nIn January 2000, Darrell Night was dropped off on the outskirts of Saskatoon\nbut was able to call a taxi from the nearby Queen Elizabeth Power Station. The\ntwo officers involved, constables Dan Hatchen and Ken Munson of the Saskatoon\nPolice Service, claimed they had simply given Night a ride home and dropped\nhim off at his own request, but were convicted of unlawful confinement in\nSeptember 2001 and sentenced to eight months in prison.^[12]^[13]^[14] Yet\ninvestigations into the deaths of Wegner and Naistus were deemed\n\"inconclusive.\"^[15]\n\nThe Saskatoon police initially insisted these were isolated incidents. But in\n2003, police chief Russell Sabo admitted that there was a possibility that the\nforce had been dumping First Nations people outside the city for years, after\nrevealing that in 1976 an officer was disciplined for taking an indigenous\nwoman to the outskirts of the city and abandoning her there.^[5]\n\nOn April 21, 2018, Ken Thomas alleged that he was picked up by two Saskatoon\nPolice officers and dropped off outside city limits at night in the cold. This\naccusation was investigated by the Public Complaints Commission, which stated\nthat it was unfounded. In a news release, Saskatoon Police chief Troy Cooper\nsaid it was unlikely that there was contact on the night of April 21, 2018,\nbetween the police and Mr. Thomas, based on video and audio recordings taken\nfrom police cars.^[16]^[17]^[18]\n\n## Censorship attempts[edit]\n\nBetween 2012 and 2016, the \"Starlight tours\" section of the Saskatoon Police\nService's English Wikipedia article was deleted several times. An internal\ninvestigation revealed that two of the edits originated from a computer within\nthe police service. Alyson Edwards, a spokesperson for the force denied that\nthe removal of content was officially approved by the force.^[19] On March 31,\n2016, the Saskatoon StarPhoenix reported that \"Saskatoon police have confirmed\nthat someone from inside the police department deleted references to\n'Starlight tours' from the Wikipedia web page about the police force.\"^[20]\nAccording to the report, a \"police spokeswoman acknowledged that the section\non starlight tours had been deleted using a computer within the department,\nbut said investigators were unable to pinpoint who did it.\"^[20] The police\nspokeswoman stated that the force is working to \"move forward with all of the\npositive work that has been done, and continues to be done that came out of\nthe Stonechild inquiry\".^[20]\n\n## In media[edit]\n\n### Film[edit]\n\nThese incidents have been addressed in two films. Darrell Night's experiences\nwere documented in Tasha Hubbard's 2004 National Film Board of Canada\ndocumentary Two Worlds Colliding, winner of the Canada Award.^[11]^[21] A\nfictional incident was also portrayed in the half-hour drama Out in the Cold,\ndirected by Colleen Murphy and starring Gordon Tootoosis,^[4] Matthew\nStrongeagle, and Erroll Kinistino.\n\n### Music[edit]\n\nIn 2005, the Canadian punk rock band Propagandhi released the album Potemkin\nCity Limits, including the song \"The Bringer of Greater Things\", which was\n\"dedicated to Rodney Naistus, Neil Stonechild and Lawrence Wegner, murdered by\nmembers of the Saskatoon Police Department\" (album liner notes).\n\nCanadian musician Kris Demeanor's song \"One Shoe\" was written about the\nSaskatoon freezing deaths, particularly Stonechild's.^[22] The Wailin' Jennys'\nsong \"Starlight\" was also inspired by the freezing deaths.^[23]\n\nIn 2017, Mi'kmaq artist Cathy Elliott completed a five-week workshop with\nstudents from Sheridan College for her musical Starlight Tour. This work was\ncommissioned by the Grand Theatre in London, Ontario^[24] in collaboration\nwith Sheridan College's \"Canadian Music Theatre Project\".^[25]\n\n### Podcasts[edit]\n\nThe freezing deaths are discussed in podcasts such as Criminal^[26]^[27] and\nCommons.^[28]\n\n### Television[edit]\n\nThe Da Vinci's Inquest episode \"The Sparkle Tour\" involved the death of a\nNative activist, allegedly as a result of the police arresting, assaulting,\nand dumping him in the outskirts in the middle of the night without his shoes;\nthe incident sparks discussion between investigators about the Saskatoon\nfreezing deaths, which are referred to as \"sparkle tours.\"\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * History portal\n  * Canada portal\n\n  * Disappearances of Terrance Williams and Felipe Santos\n  * List of cases of police brutality in Canada\n  * Police brutality against Indigenous Canadians\n  * Pinkenba Six\n  * Highway of Tears\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"Saskatoon Diefenbaker INT'L A\".
