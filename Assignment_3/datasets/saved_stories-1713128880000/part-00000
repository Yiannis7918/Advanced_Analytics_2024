And yet, he has not yet paid a political price for his\nincreasingly unstable behavior.\n\nWhile for many it\u2019s obvious how serious Trump\u2019s declining mental capacity has\nbecome, for too many Americans that reality has not yet broken through. The\nmedia continues to treat Trump like a normal candidate; many Americans have\nbaked Trump\u2019s bizarre behavior into their perceptions of him; and many take\nright-wing lies about Joe Biden\u2019s mental fitness at face value.\n\nGiven this, we wanted to hear from John Gartner, founder of Duty To Warn, a\ngroup of mental health professionals who have been raising the alarm about\nTrump\u2019s increasingly sociopathic behavior since 2017. Now in 2024, Gartner has\nan even more dire warning about Trump: that there are increasing signs the\nformer president is heading fast down the road toward dementia.\n\nSeven months out from Election Day, it\u2019s more important than ever to\nunderstand the signs of Trump\u2019s steep and disturbing decline directly from a\nmental health professional. And then it\u2019s on all of us to help amplify the\nsignal.\n\n\u2014 Jay and The Big Picture Team\n\nJohn Gartner, Founder of Duty To Warn\n\nYou have been sounding the alarm about Trump\u2019s declining mental state for some\ntime now. Can you give us a sense of the history of that effort, including why\nyou believe so many folks in the media seemed to gloss over the risk?\n\nWhen Duty to Warn began in 2017, our mission as mental health professionals\nwas to warn the world that Trump was dangerously unfit and a malignant\nnarcissist. Practically conventional wisdom today among anyone who\u2019s not in\nthe cult. But we had to bang that drum every day for 5 years to penetrate the\npublic mind. 58,000 tweets. Hundreds of interviews, all while we were being\npilloried as unethical for daring to warn the world about the American Hitler.\n\nAfter Biden won, I took off my uniform and went home. We all did. The last\nthing\u2014truly the very last thing\u2014I wanted to do, was re-enter politics. But I\ncouldn\u2019t believe my eyes. Day after day the press was gaslighting the American\npeople: Pathologizing Biden\u2019s normal signs of aging, such as forgetting names,\nand normalizing Trump\u2019s flagrant signs of dementia. That false narrative was\nhaving a real impact on the polls, and no one with the right letters after\ntheir name was stepping in to correct the record.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a new issue for me. I had written a series of op-eds about Trump\u2019s\nsigns of dementia in 2018 and 2019, and I was part of a group that publicly\npressured Ronny Jackson to give Trump the dementia screening test that he\ncan\u2019t stop bragging about \u201cacing.\u201d I\u2019d known for years Trump was showing\nmedically unmistakable signs of dementia, but the press was hyper-focused on\nBiden falling off his bike, forgetting names, and being \u201ctoo old.\u201d\n\nOne day, in silence, in my garden, I felt the Universe, God, the Force,\nwhatever you want to call it, communicate with me. It was a simple message: If\nsomeone was going to take up this struggle, it would have to be me and I said\nyes. I reactivated my long-dormant Twitter account, to fight the information\nwar, one last time.\n\nWe hear a lot about Biden\u2019s age and gaffes, to the point where most Americans\ncite Biden\u2019s age but not Trump\u2019s as a big issue for the election, even though\nthey are only three years apart. Based on what you and other experts have\nobserved, why are you sounding the alarm about Trump, but not about Biden?\n\nI call it the \u201cdouble lie.\u201d Pathologizing Biden\u2019s normal aging is the first\nlie. Normalizing Trump\u2019s dementia is the second. The sorts of small lapses\nwe\u2019ve seen in Biden are part and parcel of normal aging. Forgetting names and\ndates doesn\u2019t make us seniors less competent. What we lack in memory we more\nthan make up for in judgment, experience, and wisdom. Other cultures revere\ntheir elders, but America in 2024 mocks and devalues theirs. The problem isn\u2019t\nold people in government\u2014the dreaded \u201cgerontocracy.\u201d It\u2019s age-ism.\n\nJoe Biden\u2019s calling the current president of France by the old president of\nFrance\u2019s name is like me calling my youngest daughter by my oldest daughter\u2019s\nname, which I do all the time. When I get together with my fellow senior\ncitizens, the topic of forgetting often comes up. Sure, I forget names and\neven appointments sometimes. But I\u2019m a better psychologist now than I\u2019ve ever\nbeen. I actually pity the patients who had the young Dr. Gartner. He didn\u2019t\nknow anything, and, honestly, I can\u2019t even imagine why anyone paid him. I\nwould argue that Biden, too, has objectively performed well at his job,\ndespite, or maybe even because, of his age. Don\u2019t judge us senior citizens by\nhow fast we walk, or if we stumble over a name or two. Judge us by our\nperformance.\n\nAnd hello. Forgetting the name of the president of France isn\u2019t the same as\nthinking Obama is president or that Nikki Haley and Nancy Pelosi are one\nperson. Can we introduce a sense of proportion and some common sense here?\n\nIn other interviews, you have provided examples and evidence of Trump\u2019s\ndementia. Can you explain what that is and how it typically manifests? And can\nyou connect the dots and give examples of how Trump exhibits symptoms?\n\nI don\u2019t know if people know this, but in real life, in day-to-day clinical\npractice, we diagnose dementia based on behavioral observation and informant\nreports every day of the week. Thousands of medical charts would back me up on\nthat. An \u201cinterview\u201d with a demented person doesn\u2019t usually yield a lot of\ninformation, for obvious reasons.\n\nAs a professional community, thousands of us have observed hundreds of hours\nof Trump\u2019s public behavior. We also have dozens of informant reports. So all\nthe people hyperventilating about \u201cdiagnosing from a distance\u201d should take a\nbreath. This is more business as usual than you might think. In real life,\nwe\u2019ve institutionalized tens of thousands of patients on far less data.\n\nThe evidence for Trump\u2019s dementia is this: Trump shows an overall decline from\nhis own cognitive baseline, with marked progressive deterioration in 4 areas:\nmemory, ability to use language, behavior, and gross and fine motor skills.\n\nLet\u2019s take these one by one:\n\n1) Decline from baseline:\n\nOverall, he shows a shocking decline in verbal fluency from his previous\nbaseline. Trump was once highly articulate. He spoke in polished paragraphs\nwith a sophisticated vocabulary. Now, his vocabulary is impoverished, and he\noften can\u2019t finish a sentence or even a word. Typical of dementia patients, he\nrepeats himself and overuses superlatives and filler words.\n\nIn \u201cTrump wasn\u2019t always so linguistically challenged. What could explain the\nchange?\u201d senior science writer Sharon Begley conducted an informal study of\nTrump\u2019s linguistic decline in 2017:\n\n> \u201cWe asked experts in neurolinguistics and cognitive assessment, as well as\n> psychologists and psychiatrists, to compare Trump\u2019s speech from decades ago\n> to that in 2017; they all agreed there had been a deterioration, and some\n> said it could reflect changes in the health of Trump\u2019s brain. ..For decades,\n> studies have found that deterioration in the fluency, complexity and level\n> of vocabulary of spontaneous speech can indicate slipping brain function due\n> to normal aging or neurodegenerative disease.\u201d\n>\n> \u201cIn the 1980\u2019s,\u201d Begley wrote, \u201cTrump fluently peppered his answers with\n> words and phrases such as \u201csubsided,\u201d \u201cinclination,\u201d \u201cdiscredited,\u201d\n> \u201csparring session,\u201d and \u201ca certain innate intelligence.\u201d He tossed off well-\n> turned sentences such as, \u201cIt could have been a contentious route,\u201d and,\n> \u201cThese are the only casinos in the United States that are so rated\u201d...Now,\n> Trump\u2019s vocabulary is simpler. He repeats himself over and over, and lurches\n> from one subject to an unrelated one.\u201d\n\nA Boston Globe study found in 2015 that Trump was speaking at a 4th grade\nlevel, much lower than the other candidates, but more importantly much lower\nthan his former self. An Ivy League graduate who once \u201ctossed off well-turned\nphrases\u201d had fallen to a 4th-grade level of speech. The MOCA dementia\nscreening test that Trump brags about passing is slated to the mental age of a\nkindergartener (\u201cShow me the picture of the lion?). Only a few grades to go.\n\nBut not only has Trump declined dramatically since the 1980s. More alarming is\nthat Trump has declined far more precipitously in the last 4 years. Multiple\nformer members of his administration report being shocked that \u201che\u2019s not the\nsame person he was.\u201d\n\nThis is very important for people to understand. Not only will Trump continue\nto get worse and worse, his rate of decline is accelerating, and if he is\ntypical, he will fall off what they call the \u201ccognitive cliff\u201d relatively\nsoon. Based on his current accelerating rate of decline, it seems very\nunlikely that Trump could see out a second term without falling off the cliff\nand becoming totally incapacitated.\n\n2) Memory:\n\nForgetting names and dates is normal for people who are aging, like Joe Biden,\nand me, and millions of others. By stark contrast, the Dementia Care Society\nsays \u201cconfusing people and generations\u201d is a sign of advanced dementia. And\nthis is the type of profound memory disturbance we\u2019re seeing in Trump.\n\nRecently, Trump confused Nikki Haley and Nancy Pelosi. You can kind of intuit\nhow the demented thought process works in Trump\u2019s mind to combine people.\nThere\u2019s an archetype in his head of a hated powerful female politician he is\nfighting. Fragments of Nikki Haley and Nancy Pelosi stick to this miasma of\nill-defined thought and feeling, and combine in his imagination to form a new\ncombined person who doesn\u2019t really exist: Bad, bad, Nikki-Pelosi woman. Me\nhate her.\n\n8 times he\u2019s said he\u2019s running against Obama. How often does he say and think\nit in private? I think this suggests that Trump has also combined Obama and\nBiden into one imaginary hated Joe-Obama person. The Trump campaign is trying\nto spin it as if Trump was either joking or suggesting Biden is an Obama\npuppet or some such thing. Nice try. Trump said it plainly, over and over. He\ndidn\u2019t look like he was joking (does he ever?) and said literally nothing to\nsuggest he was referring to some Biden-Obama cabal.\n\nThe more plausible explanation is that once again we are watching the workings\nof his demented mind in real time. Obama and Biden have something very\nimportant in common in Trump\u2019s brain that can allow them to be fused in his\nmolten mind: two Democratic presidents who bested and humiliated him have\nbecome one imaginary super-villain.\n\nWhat happens to a nation when its chief executive has lost his capacity for\nexecutive functioning? Michael Wolff wrote that Trump not infrequently failed\nto recognize old friends. I don\u2019t mean he forgot their names. He acted as if\nhe\u2019d never seen them before in his life. If you\u2019ve ever had a relative with\ndementia you know how heartbreaking that stage of decline can be-- to have to\nremind a loved one of who you are.\n\nTrump is almost there.\n\n3) Language\n\nTrump shows formal signs of disordered speech we typically see only in\norganically impaired dementia patients:\n\nA) \u201cphonemic aphasia\u201d\n\nTrump uses non-words in place of real words, that usually include a fragment\nof the actual word. For example saying \u201cmishuz\u201d instead of missile, or\n\u201cChrishus\u201d instead of Christmas. You can look at supercut reels assembled by\nRon Filipkowski on Twitter, The Daily Show, and now by the Democratic House\nJudiciary Committee, as well. Both Chairman Nadler and Rep. Swalwell showed\ntheir own supercuts of Trump\u2019s cognitive decline at the Hur hearings, to\ncounteract Hur\u2019s partisan slur about Biden\u2019s \u201cpoor memory.\u201d\n\nTo demonstrate how pervasive these errors are, I present this long but far\nfrom exhaustive list of Trump\u2019s phonemic aphasias:\n\n> \u201cPresident U-licious S Grant\u201d (For Ulysses S. Grant)\n>\n> \u201cspace-capsicle\u201d (for space capsule)\n>\n> \u201ccombat infantroopen\u201d(for combat infantry)\n>\n> \u201csahhven country\u201d(for sovereign country)\n>\n> \u201crenoversh\u201d (For renovations)\n>\n> \u201cAnonmmiss\u201d (for anonymous).\n>\n> \u201ctranspants\u201d (for transplants)\n>\n> \u201clawmarkers\u201d (for lawmakers)\n>\n> \u201csupply churn\u201d (for supply chain)\n>\n> \u201cRusher\u201d (for Russia)\n>\n> \u201craydoh\u201d (for radio)\n>\n> \u201cLiberal-ation (for liberation\u201d)\n>\n> \u201cbenefishers\u201d (for benificiaries)\n>\n> \u201ccon-ducking\u201d (for conducting)\n>\n> \u201cstat-tics, suh-tic-six\u201d (for statistics)\n>\n> \u201ccrimakle\u201d (for criminal)\n>\n> \u201carmed forsiva\u201d (for armed forces)\n>\n> \u201cinternate\u201d (for Internet)\n>\n> \u201ctransjija\u201d (for transition)\n>\n> \u201cstanktuary\u201d (for sanctuary)\n\nThat last example took place during Trump\u2019s State of the Union Address, just\nto contrast that with the SOTU we just witnessed. In recent rallies in GA, NC,\nand VA over the course of just a few days Trump evidenced more examples:\n\n> \u201cWe have becrumb a nation\u201d\n>\n> \u201cAll comp-ply-ments\u201d to Joe Biden.\n>\n> \u201cI know Poten.\u201d\n>\n> \u201cHe can\u2019t cam-pay. He can\u2019t campaign.\u201d\n>\n> \u201cWe will expel the wald-mongers.\u201d\n\nBut of course, this is exactly what we should expect. As he deteriorates,\nthese deficits will make themselves apparent more and more often. Now he can\u2019t\nget through a rally without an example. Cornell psychologist Harry Segal\nspeculated Trump may be \u201csundowning\u201d and hence most vulnerable to going off\nthe rails at night-time rallies.\n\nSome have argued that Trump\u2019s impaired speech could be an articulation\nproblem, rather than a brain problem. Some have argued he could be slurring\nfrom a variety of causes, from loose dentures to drug toxicity (indeed many\nhave speculated that Trump might be abusing or even snorting Adderall or some\nother stimulant.)\n\nBut all those competing explanations are disproven by one fact. Trump commits\nthese aphasic errors in his written posts, as well, proving the problem is in\nhis brain, not his articulation.\n\nFor example, he recently posted:\n\n> \u201cJoe Buden DISINFORMATES AND MISINFORMATES\u201d\n\nB) \u201cSemantic aphasia\u201d\n\nSemantic aphasia is using a real word, but in a way that doesn\u2019t correspond to\nits meaning. For example, when Trump referred to the \u201coranges of the\ninvestigation.\u201d Another example would be \u201cmidtown and midturn elections.\u201d\nRecently, when apparently trying to say \u201cthree years later,\u201d Trump said:\n\n> \u201cThree years, lady, lady, lady.\u201d\n\nMore recently Trump said at a rally:\n\n> \u201cWe\u2019re going to protect pro-God...\u201d\n\nIn mid-sentence he goes blank and looks at the ceiling. When he reboots, the\nwords he uses to complete the sentence don\u2019t make sense:\n\n> \u201c...context and content.\u201d\n\nC) Complete loss of all verbal language\n\nLike an infant sometimes, Trump just makes sounds:\n\n> \u201cGang boong. This is me. I hear bing.\u201d\n\nUntil finally, he is reduced to silence.\n\n> \u201cSaudi Arabia and Russia will re-ve-du. Ohhh...\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s face went blank, followed by a sigh, and a silent pause while he\nlooked at the ceiling.\n\nD) Tangential Thinking\n\nTrump evidences \u201ctangential thinking\u201d where he drifts from one unrelated\nthought fragment to another, and sometimes tries to \u201cconfabulate\u201d them into a\nstory. But the narrative is literally incoherent. When the press describes\nTrump\u2019s speeches as \u201crambling,\u201d they are gaslighting us with a euphemistic\nword that normalizes the grossly abnormal. Trump regularly degenerates into\nincomprehensible strings of words.\n\nJust recently outside a New York courtroom, Trump declared:\n\n> \u201cWe can\u2019t have an election in the middle of a political season. We just had\n> Super Tuesday. And we had a Tuesday after Tuesday already.\u201d\n\nOther examples would be:\n\n> \u201cWe are an institute in a powerful death penalty. We will put this on.\u201d\n\n> \u201cI could tell you about aircraft carriers, where they use electric\n> catapults. They couldn\u2019t go to the steam, which works better for about\n> 1/100th the price, you know? The electric catapult, you know that story? I\n> could tell you about the elevators on a tremendous carrier, the Gerald Ford,\n> and they decided not to use hydraulic like the John Deere tractor, they\n> decided to use magnets, \u2018we\u2019re gonna use magnets!\u2019 to lift up the elevators\n> with seven planes.\u201d\n\nIn a recent string of rallies in GA, SC, and VA he said:\n\n> \u201cThey say I\u2019m cognitively impaired. I\u2019m not cognitively.\u201d\n\n> \u201cThey don\u2019t want illegal immigrants knocking on their front door and saying\n> I\u2019m going to use your kitchen. And I\u2019m going to use your bedroom and there\u2019s\n> not a damn thing. And that\u2019s the nice ones, okay?\u201d\n\n> \u201cThey raided my house in Florida, Mar-a-Lago, they raided. With no raid,\n> they had no reason to do so.\u201d\n\nSome of his utterances are incomprehensible for a different reason. They\nsuggest Trump is so disoriented he\u2019s occupying a different reality than\neveryone else.\n\nFor example:\n\n> \u201cThey\u2019re weaponizing law enforcement for high-level interference against Joe\n> Biden\u2019s top and only political appointment. A guy named me. A guy named me.\u201d\n\nAt a recent rally, he said:\n\n> \u201cBiden beat Barack Hussein Obama. Ever heard of him?\u201d\n\nBiden never beat Obama. So we have to conclude that Trump is confused about\nbasic reality, and living in a different reality that changes unpredictably.\nWhen a confused patient is evaluated in an emergency room, a standard\npsychiatric question to determine if a patient is disoriented is:\n\n> \u201cWho is President of the United States?\u201d\n\nIf you get that wrong the most probable explanations are dementia, psychosis\nor drug toxicity, and most probably you\u2019d be admitted for observation in any\ncase.\n\n4) Motor Performance:\n\nDementia expert Elisabeth Zoffmann, assistant professor of Forensic Psychiatry\nat the\n\nUniversity of British Columbia, told Salon that Trump evidences a \u201cwide-based\ngait, commonly found among patients with dementia. Video online shows that he\nswings his right leg in a semi-circle as if it were dragging a dead weight. He\nhas also shown deterioration in his fine motor coordination, for example\nhaving difficulty drinking a bottle or a glass of water without two hands.\n\nSome doctors have also pointed out the peculiar way he leans forward as a\ntypical sign of a type of dementia known as frontotemporal dementia. It could\nbe frontotemporal, or it could be Alzheimer\u2019s like his father had. There\u2019s\nmore than one cause of dementia and that\u2019s where a brain scan would be\nhelpful, but we\u2019re never going to get to see that.\n\n5) Behavior:\n\nHe is showing marked deterioration in impulse control and judgment, becoming\never more paranoid, aggressive and confused. Even the judges in his cases are\nthrowing up their hands because they see Trump actually can\u2019t control his\noutbursts at this point, it\u2019s like a Tourette\u2019s tic.\n\nWhat are the real risks to our nation of a president who is exhibiting signs\nof dementia? I can imagine a list of horribles, but what are some of the ones\nthat spring foremost to mind?\n\nIt\u2019s an axiom that when a patient with a personality disorder becomes\ndemented, everything about their personality-disordered behavior gets\nexponentially worse. Trump will become more horribly Trumpian, if you can\nbelieve it. Everything evil and destructive about him will become even more\nexaggerated in an unbound, and even more erratic way, until he is nothing but\nrageful id, with no rational control or inhibitions. It will be pure chaos.\nFrom that point, there\u2019s simply no bad outcome that you can think of that\u2019s\ninconceivable.\n\nPeople need to understand dementia is a progressive illness, which means the\nTrump you see today is the best Trump you\u2019re ever going to see. It\u2019s all\ndownhill from here. Trump\u2019s rate of decline is accelerating, and if he\u2019s\ntypical, at some point, he will \u201cfall off a cognitive cliff\u201d and become\ncompletely disabled.\n\nTrump could be found wandering the lawn of the White House in his pajamas\nconfused about where he is. I\u2019m not joking. I honestly believe that will\nhappen if he\u2019s reelected. At the rate that he\u2019s deteriorating, I don\u2019t believe\nit would be possible for him to get through the next 4 and a half years\nwithout becoming incapacitated while in office.\n\nIn the Middle Ages they said: \u201cA bad king is better than no king. And no king\nis better than a child king.\u201d That\u2019s what we would have: a king (because he\u2019ll\nbe a dictator from \u201cday one\u201d) who, while always a child temperamentally, will\nhave becomes a child mentally, as well.\n\nEven in this scenario where his cronies try to control him, I see Trump\nescaping his handlers, and seizing control, even in his demented state, to\nwreak catastrophic havoc, destruction, and revenge.\n\nYou\u2019re not alone in your concerns about Trump, and you\u2019ve even begun a\npetition from medical professionals warning of the danger. Can you tell us\nabout that effort and whether it is moving the needle?\n\nI knew I couldn\u2019t break through the false narrative about Trump and Biden\u2019s\ncognitive health alone. We needed a chorus of professional voices. To summon\nthem I reached out to colleagues and put a petition for licensed medical and\nmental health professionals online that states in part:\n\n> \u201cOur diagnostic impression of Trump is probable dementia. From our years of\n> training and experience, we are convinced that, while a definitive diagnosis\n> would require further testing, Donald Trump is showing unmistakable signs\n> strongly suggesting dementia, based on his public behavior and informant\n> reports that show progressive deterioration in memory, thinking, ability to\n> use language, behavior, and both gross and fine motor skills.\u201d\n\nWe have over 500 valid signatures (we have to discard 2/3 of the signatures\nthat we can\u2019t confirm are professionals), and that number is growing. However,\nto me, more persuasive than the number of signatures, are the comments left by\nthe signers explaining their professional reasoning and describing the\nsymptoms of dementia they see in Trump.\n\nI put those comments together in one tweet thread and pinned it to the top of\nmy Duty To Warn account. I\u2019m grateful that 1.8 million people have had a\nchance to read it. The collective voices of these professionals are powerful.\n\nHere are a few examples:\n\n> \u201cI am a neuropsychiatrist and movement disorders neurologist at an academic\n> medical center. There is more than enough reason to suspect dementia\n> including worsening thought process, looser connections between thoughts,\n> tangentiality, paraphasias, irritability, paranoia, persecutory ideation,\n> impulsivity, and so on; which are clearly different than videos of him from\n> 10 years ago.\n>\n> \u201cWithout personally examining him, I cannot clarify further, but he appears\n> to at least have a cautious gait. The most plausible disorder would be a\n> mixture of frontal lobe dysfunction (sort of like frontotemporal Dementia or\n> CTE) from a vascular Dementia.\u201d -- Ankur Butala, M.D.\n\n> \u201cAs an experienced physician who was board-certified in Family Medicine,\n> Geriatrics, and Emergency Medicine...Trump clearly demonstrates\n> deteriorating cognitive function. His public posture, leaning forward when\n> standing, his difficulty walking down a ramp, and his increasing speech\n> difficulties are suggestive of frontotemporal dementia. Again, this is all\n> based on public information and my years of experience.\u201d ---Thomas C. Long,\n> M.D.\n\n> \u201cThe evidence for dementia in Donald Trump has become overwhelming.

Some psychologists were eloquent about Trump\u2019s\nmalignant narcissism in 2019, but no one is talking about Trump\u2019s dramatic\ndecline at the podium. It\u2019s true that Biden has an old brain, but it\u2019s\nfunctioning well. Trump demonstrates atypical dementia onset every week.\n\nI have extensive experience with elderly populations, and any geriatric\npsychologist will tell you that dementia doesn\u2019t come on all at once. It\nbegins to show when someone is under stress or tired, that\u2019s why the term\n\u201csun-downing\u201d is so descriptive. My grave concern: we are now seeing Trump at\nan early, yet very troubling, stage of dementia. I\u2019ve seen from Donald Trump\nin the past six months, his speech is riddled with cognitive errors,\nmisattributions, and odd digressions indicating a significant decline in\nfunctioning. I would strongly insist on an extensive mental\nhealth/neuropsychological assessment if one of my elderly relatives was\nspeaking the way Trump does.\n\nIn the past few months, Republicans have accused Joe Biden of being \u201cconfused\u201d\nand \u201cincoherent,\u201d arguing that he\u2019s aging badly. Yet his State of the Union\naddress disproved any of these claims \u2013 he is a high-functioning elderly\npresident. All of this focus on Biden\u2019s age has distracted commentators and\nreporters from the obvious decline in Trump\u2019s functioning. He repeatedly\nstates he\u2019s running against Obama, while his speeches often give way to odd\ndigressions that leave him and the audience bewildered. During his presidency,\nTrump was erratic, explosive, and prone to pathological lying. Now, it\u2019s even\nmore dire because he\u2019s losing his ability to think coherently.\u201d --Harry Segal,\nPh.D. Department of Psychology, Cornell University\n\nWe\u2019ve met plenty of resistance but more and more we\u2019re starting to be heard.\nThe funny thing is that every time a journalist writes about us, they\u2019re\nshocked by the magnitude of the public response. We\u2019ve been covered by Salon,\nThe Hill, and my hometown paper, the Baltimore Sun. In each case, the article\nsat on their respective publication\u2019s leaderboards as the #1 most-read article\nfor days.\n\nDan Rodricks who wrote the Sun column told me the last article that got that\nmany views was \u201cRavens make the playoffs.\u201d People are hungry for reality and\nobjective truth. They want to know the medical truth about both Biden and\nTrump\u2019s cognitive health and learn it from credible sources they can trust. If\nyou can\u2019t trust doctors, when we\u2019re talking about a medical condition, then\nwho can you trust?\n\nShare\n\nJohn Gartner is a former assistant professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity Medical School.

They also all recognize that Trump is still their \"big ticket\nitem\" for getting GOP turnout, and that without him the Republicans will not\ngalvanize their base and get the voter turnout that they need to win in\nNovember. They are using Trump as their spearpoint for project 2025, and are\nfully prepared to invoke the 25th amendment once he gets into office. Once\nthey have captured the government, they don't need him anymore.Expand full\ncommentLike (230)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n55 replies\n\nBruceApr 11Liked by Jay KuoOne small correction, the former guy DOES NOT HAVE\nAN MBA.
