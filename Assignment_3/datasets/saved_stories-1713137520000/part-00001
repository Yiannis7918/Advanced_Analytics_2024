Stripe or Paddle?\n\nA founder's guide to payment processing for subscription start-ups\n\nBy\n\nGeoff Roberts\n\n\u00b7\n\n11 min read\n\n## In this post\n\nMerchant of Record\n\nVAT (Value Added Tax)\n\nShould I use a Merchant of Record?\n\nHow much am I going to end up paying in payment processing fees?\n\nSo... Stripe or Paddle?\n\nWhat about Outseta?\n\nUpdated April 2023\n\nIf there's one thing that I've learned in six years as the founder of a\npayments company, it's that most founders are confused about what they need\nand what they'll actually end up paying when it comes to payment processing. I\ncome across threads like this daily, where founders ask questions like:\n\n  * Should I use Stripe or Paddle?\n  * I'm based in Europe\u2014what do I need to handle VAT?\n  * What does \"Merchant of Record\" mean?\n  * How much am I going to end up paying for payment processing?\n\nI set out to write a guide to make sense of it all\u2014what I found in the process\nsurprised me.\n\n> The vast majority of founders\u2014many of whom were experienced founders that\n> vehemently insisted that they knew exactly what they were paying for payment\n> processing\u2014didn't know the actual effective rate they're currently paying to\n> process payments.\n\nLet's make sense of this topic once and for all so you know what you need and\nwhat you'll pay, starting with a few important definitions.\n\n## Merchant of Record\n\nA merchant of record (MoR) is the entity that is authorized, and held liable,\nby a financial institution to process a consumer\u2019s credit and debit card\ntransactions. The MoR is also the name that appears on the consumer\u2019s credit\ncard statement.\n\n## VAT (Value Added Tax)\n\nVAT is a tax that's applied to most goods and services bought for consumption\nor use in the European Union.\n\nAs it pertains to selling subscription based digital products there are a few\nimportant items to consider:\n\n  * First, VAT is sometimes included in the total cost of an item rather than being calculated on top of the advertised price of the product or service. This is often referred to as tax inclusive or tax exclusive pricing.\n  * Second, there are additional specifics in terms of how VAT is displayed at checkout and on invoices that need to be considered in order to be compliant with EU regulations.\n  * Finally, there are thresholds for each country in the EU\u2014if you're processing less than these amounts you don't need to worry about VAT at all. Founders in the EU can start processing payments with any product they like without worrying too much about VAT... that is until their sales volume crosses certain thresholds.\n\nWith these terms understood, let's tackle the tough questions founders often\nface.\n\n## Should I use a Merchant of Record?\n\nThere are a growing number of companies out there\u2014like Paddle and Gumroad\u2014that\nact as a merchant of record on your behalf. If you choose one of these\nproducts to process payments for your business, your customers are technically\ntransacting with these businesses rather than yours. There are both pros and\ncons to this to consider:\n\n#### Pros\n\n  * The primary benefit of using a merchant of record is convenience around VAT\u2014they'll handle VAT for you. They remit all taxes and paperwork then send you the remaining funds\u2014in essence these companies issue your business a payout as if you were an affiliate after they've paid the required taxes. This is particularly useful if you're an individual creator without the resources required to file corporate taxes in Europe.\n\n#### Cons\n\n  * You'll pay a premium price to work with a merchant of record. For example, Paddle charges 5% per transaction and Gumroad charges 10% per transaction plus Stripe fees. But in either case, there's fine print\u2014if you're selling subscription products internationally, you'll be charged at least another 2% on top of these fees. That means paying fees of 7%-14% per transaction is very common when using a MoR.\n  * Customers will see the name of the merchant of record on their bank statements rather than the name of your business. This is a common source of confusion that you'll need to plan to address. It's a substantial enough issue that an awful lot of Paddle's website is devoted to deflecting support volume from customers trying to figure out why they were charged by Paddle.\n  * You'll be subject to slower approval processes when you start your business. A merchant of record assumes responsibility for all of the products and services sold via their platform\u2014as a result they have slower approval processes to get started.\n  * You open your business up to significantly higher platform risk. If a merchant of record sells a product on their platform that's not permitted, all sellers that use the platform are at risk\u2014your ability to process and collect payments can be shut down altogether. It's worth educating yourself on the platform risk associated with merchant or record payment processors.\n\nMy own two cents\u2014if you're the founder of a start-up in the EU that sells one-\ntime products, I think the convenience offered by using a merchant of record\nmakes a lot of sense as you're getting your business off the ground. But if\nyou sell subscription based products, I'd be uncomfortable paying 7%-14% of my\nrevenue in perpetuity for the convenience a merchant of record affords.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that Paddle can only be used by founders of SaaS\ncompanies. That's not the case with Gumroad\u2014I think it makes a ton of sense\nthat Gumroad acts as a merchant of record given their focus on processing\npayments for individual creators.\n\n## How much am I going to end up paying in payment processing fees?\n\nLet me state this outright so there's no confusion around this:\n\n> \"Stripe fees\" are not created equal!\n\nOne of the most common misconceptions in the start-up world is that Stripe\nfees are simply 2.9% + $.30 per transaction. I was able to show almost every\nsingle founder that I spoke to in the process of writing this post that this\nis not what they're currently paying for payment processing, despite the vast\nmajority thinking that this was the full rate they are paying on each\ntransaction.\n\nThis is not a criticism of Stripe\u2014Outseta is a Stripe Verified Partner and\ngiven the complexity of what they offer I think their pricing is both fair and\ntransparent. But it is to say that the assumption that \"Stripe fees\" are all\nthe same regardless of the products you use to process payments is flat out\nwrong. If this is an important topic to you, the devil is in the details.\n\n### Any product that creates \"subscriptions\" in your Stripe account uses\nStripe Billing\u2014and you're being charged extra for it\n\nWhether you're using Stripe's own tools or third party membership software, if\n\"Subscriptions\" are being created in your Stripe account you're paying extra\nfees to use Stripe Billing. This ranges from an additional fee of .5% to .8%\nper transaction, meaning that 2.9% per transaction just became 3.4%-3.7% at a\nminimum. Let me be very clear about this, because this has surprised the vast\nmajority of founders I've chatted with:\n\n  * Stripe's own billing tools aren't free\u2014you incur additional charges to use them.\n  * Membership software products that create subscriptions in Stripe pass these additional fees on to their customers.\n\nYou won't find these fees if you look at your Stripe fees at an individual\ntransaction level\u2014they're billed at the account level. You can find these fees\nwithin your Stripe account by going to All Transactions.\n\nThe takeaway here is simple\u2014look in your Stripe account and if you see\n\"Subscriptions\" then you're already paying for Stripe's billing products. This\nis even more important if you're actively evaluating membership management\nsoftware. Most vendors, Outseta included, charge a fee that ranges from 1% to\n5% in addition to \"Stripe fees.\" Customers often evaluate products largely\nagainst these additional fees, but almost never stop to consider that \"Stripe\nfees\" may be different between products.\n\n> If you use any product to process payments that creates subscriptions in\n> Stripe, you'll pay at least .5% to .8% in higher fees on every transaction.\n\n### Additional differences in Stripe fees seen at the individual transaction\nlevel\n\nA closer inspection of your individual transactions can also reveal\nsignificant differences in what you're paying as Stripe fees. There's a lot of\nnuance here and it's up to you, as the consumer, to dig into what's actually\nbeing charged. Here's a specific transaction from one of the most popular\nmembership software providers:\n\nIn the case of this particular transaction, the Application Fee represents the\nadditional fee paid to the membership software provider. It's very clearly 1%\nin this scenario.\n\nBut the Stripe processing fees of $10.03 aren't as clear\u2014it's very easy to\nlook at this transaction and just assume it's the standard 2.9% fee. If we\ntake out the $.30 per transaction fee, the Stripe processing fees are $9.73.\nThis represents a 3.9% fee rather than a 2.9% fee\u2014easy to miss, but\nundoubtedly higher than the assumption that all \"Stripe fees\" are 2.9% + .30\nper transaction.\n\nSome additional circumstances to be aware of when it comes to what you'll pay:\n\n  * Standard Stripe fees vary by geography. For example, in the US credit cards incur costs of 2.9% + $.30 per transaction. For cards in Europe, standard fees are 1.4% + .25\u20ac per transaction.\n  * Cross border transactions typically incur additional Stripe fees between .8%-1.2% per transaction. This makes sense, as Stripe incurs additional costs for these transactions and passes the costs along to you. But it's worth noting that this does raise the effective rate that you're paying in processing fees by another 1% or so.\n  * Stripe has additional products for invoicing, taxes, and other scenarios that may also result in you paying higher fees. Here's a list of those products and the associated fees.\n\nAs you can see, there's a lot more to \"Stripe Fees\" than 2.9% + $.30 per\ntransaction!\n\n## So... Stripe or Paddle?\n\nA lot of the founders that I have this conversation with say to me, \"It's just\ncrazy that Paddle takes a 5% fee on every transaction... right?\"\n\nIn short, I'd say no it's not\u2014you're paying for the convenience of not needing\nto deal with VAT. While I personally wouldn't want to pay a 5%-7% fee in\nperpetuity, I think it's completely reasonable to do so as you get your\nbusiness off the ground.\n\nAs you consider this question, you also need to evaluate Stripe's alternative\nto Paddle\u2014as mentioned before, an EU customer is going to get charged 1.4% +\n$.25\u20ac per transaction. If Stripe's tax product is also used, that's an\nadditional .5% per transaction\u2014but you're still nearly 3% under what you'd be\npaying Paddle on a per transaction basis.\n\nStripe's tax product is fantastic in that it handles VAT calculation and\nreporting for you, you still need to actually remit your taxes. This isn't\ndone for you as it is with a merchant of record, so you'll likely need to\nexpend your own time or hire someone at additional costs to file your taxes.\nAnd then there's also additional Stripe fees that could be incurred aside from\njust their tax product, so the effective rate that you end up paying may creep\nup close to 5% anyways.\n\nMy hope is this post arms you with the information needed to look at what\nyou'd actually be paying Stripe versus Paddle.\n\n## What about Outseta?\n\nI started digging into this topic because for the past few months we've been\nwrestling with arguably the most difficult product decision we've had to make\nin Outseta's five year history. We originally set out to build Outseta largely\nbecause there wasn't any way to create subscriptions in Stripe when we started\nbuilding\u2014we set out to build the product we wanted and needed as SaaS founders\nourselves!\n\nStripe would start building their own subscription management and billing\ntools about two years after we launched Outseta, but by that point we'd\nalready built our own subscription management and invoicing features upon\nwhich Outseta relies today. This also has it's own pros and cons.\n\n#### Pros\n\n  * We have the flexibility to offer any product types and billing scenarios we want. There are a bunch of billing scenarios that we support that Stripe doesn't, on which we win business.\n  * We don't use Stripe's Billing products today, so we can offer substantial savings to our customers versus competitors that do use these products under the hood (which is the vast majority of our competitors).\n\n#### Cons\n\n  * We need to continue to maintain our own subscription management and invoicing tools.\n  * There are a good number of products in Stripe's ecosystem that work \"out-of-the-box\" with other tools that use Stripe Billing. We can still integrate with most of these tools, but it requires more effort.\n\nWe now have a significant competitive advantage as a result of building this\nfunctionality ourselves\u2014we don't pass the costs of Stripe Billing on to our\ncustomers as the vast majority of our competitors do. In addition, I was\nsurprised to see how much some of our competitors are charging in addition to\nStripe fees\u2014often 2%, 3%, or 4%. Frankly, I think that's kind of nuts\u2014we're\ncommitted to never charging more than 1%, and for our 1% fee you also get our\nCRM, email, help desk, and reporting tools.\n\nAnd a final difference\u2014these additional fees are almost always taken out at\nthe point of the transaction as Application Fees. As I showed earlier, that\nmakes it easy to miss how much you're actually paying in total fees to a\nmembership software provider. Instead, we don't take our 1% fee out as part of\nthe transaction\u2014we directly bill our customers for the 1% fee each month based\non their payment volume.\n\nHonestly, this probably hurts us because we're deliberately sending our\ncustomers an invoice that shows the total payment processing fees that they're\npaying to Outseta. That can look like a big number but it's almost certainly\nsubstantially less than fees captured at the point of the transaction. Based\non all the confusion around this topic, I'm happy that we're overtly\ntransparent with our fees.\n\nHere's a very common illustrative example for a US-based customer:\n\nOutseta\n\n  * Standard Stripe fees of 2.9% + $.30 per transaction\n  * 1% fee (to Outseta)\n  * Total fees: 3.9% + $.30 per transaction\n\nOther membership software providers\n\n  * Standard Stripe fees of 2.9% + $.30 per transaction\n  * Stripe Billing fee of .8% per transaction\n  * 2% fee (to membership software provider)\n  * Total fees: 5.7% + $.30 per transaction\n\nWhile Outseta's pricing is a huge advantage for our customers\u2014and frankly,\nsomething we weren't entirely aware of until now\u2014it's worth note that we still\nhave work to do to better handle VAT for our customers in Europe. This is\ncurrently our #1 product priority and something we're working closely with the\nteam at Stripe on.\n\nIf you have questions on any of the material covered in this article, we'd\nlove to hear your feedback. We hope this post help clear up a lot of the\nconfusion around these topics that founders often struggle with!\n\nIn addition to this post, we published a deeper exploration on the topic of\nPaddle vs. Stripe, when to use a merchant of record, and global sales tax\ncompliance. This is a rapidly changing topic that we'll continue to cover on\nan ongoing basis.\n\n## About your hosts\n\nNo items found.\n\nAwesome, thanks for signing up!\n\nOops!

But I still have some questions. Recently, we've\nbeen considering whether to continue using Paddle as our Merchant of Record or\nswitch to Stripe as our Payment Processor to handle our orders. We sell\nsoftware worldwide, with customers from the United States, Canada, Australia,\nthe United Kingdom, various European countries (such as France, Germany,\nSpain, Italy, Portugal, etc.), as well as Brazil, Mexico, and other countries.\nIf we switch to Stripe, we'll face a significant issue with taxes since global\ntaxation is a complex issue for us. Do you have any good suggestions? Thank\nyou so much!\n\nReply\n\nAdding your reply...\n\nOops!

There is a big error in the article when\nsaying that you only need to account sales taxes in the EU. There is an\nobligation to raise and report sales tax on digital goods sold in the US as\nwell as in many other countries around the world besides EU.\n\nReply\n\nAdding your reply...\n\nOops!

I am a\nlittle confused by one thing though, you say that VAT is only applicable in\nthe EU? My advisors and tax consultants don't agree, there is an obligation to\nraise and report sales tax on digital goods sold in the US now too, as well as\nin about 50 other countries that we sell to? How did you conclude that\nopposite? Would love to save the work ;).\n\nReply\n\nAdding your reply...\n\nOops!

Our legal advice is always \"you should talk to your accountant.\"\nYour location, what you sell, and ever-changing laws means there's a lot of\nnuance here and it's your obligation to ensure you're in compliance. That\nsaid, I'd say the following in terms of offering practical advice. At some\npoint you absolutely do have to pay sales tax in the US on digital\nsubscriptions\u2014that's true. But there are revenue thresholds on a state by\nstate basis where this becomes true. In the EU those thresholds are fairly\nlow, in the US you often need to sell somewhere between $100,000-$500,000 of\nsubscription products in a given state before you have any responsibility to\npay tax there. As a result, this a non-factor for most start-ups for a long\ntime to come. Beyond that, you'll need to assess where your business has\n\"nexus.\" This loosely defined as where you have offices / full-time employees.\nMost SaaS businesses that we see will start paying sales tax in the state(s)\nwhere they have nexus to start, then will fold in additional states as they\npass the required revenue thresholds. Long story short, for a US based\nbusiness this is a problem that will need to be solved eventually but is\ntypically not something that you need to worry much about in the early stages\nof your company. Hope this helps!\n\nA\n\nAnonymous\n\nMarch 19, 2023\n\nGreat article\n\nReply\n\nAdding your reply...\n\nOops!
