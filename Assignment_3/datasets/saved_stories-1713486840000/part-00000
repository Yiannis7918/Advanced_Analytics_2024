Mainstream proprietary offerings\nlike macOS or ChromeOS may have some security benefits over the many Linux\ndistros available, but Linux's strengths far outweigh these potential\nshortcomings.\n\nThat being said, the applications you put on your machine can make or break\nyour privacy and/or security as well, regardless of what operating system you\nrun. That's why I have three Linux desktop apps that you should give a try\ntoday that can help improve your digital privacy in one way or another.\n\n## Metadata Cleaner\n\nMany people don't know how much information a picture can actually store,\napart from the obvious \u201ca thousand words\u201d and all. Whether it's information\nregarding the time the photo was taken, where it was taken, or even which\ndevice took it, a photo can carry a lot of metadata that can accidentally dox\nyou if you aren't careful.\n\nAnd it's not just photos either. Many files and documents can contain metadata\nabout to whom they belong, who made them, their origins, etc. That's where\nMetadata Cleaner comes in. Metadata Cleaner does exactly what the title\nsays\u2014it cleans all that metadata from your files and photos, so you can safely\nshare them with other people or online.\n\nJust open the app, add the files you want to be scrubbed, and let it do its\nthing. It even has light mode if your needs are minor and you want a quicker\noutput. The app is easy to use, it does a quality job from what I can tell,\nand thanks to Flathub, it's easy to install.\n\nDownload Metadata Cleaner\n\n## Obfuscate\n\nMaybe it's not metadata you are worried about. Perhaps there is something or\nsomeone in your photos you want omitted for one reason or another. Obfuscate\nis here to save the day.\n\nObfuscate lets you quickly and easily redact private information from your\nphotos. You can simply blur out any portion of the photo you want or need, or\nyou can even draw a solid black box over it.\n\nThe latter is significantly more private and secure, so I recommend using that\noption most of the time.\n\nThis is particularly handy when sharing sensitive files online for whatever\nreason. Let's say you need to email a copy of your driver's license to\nsomeone, but you don't want them to know your home address. Perhaps you've\ntaken a photo you wish to share on social media but need to hide a license\nplate as illustrated in the photo above.\n\nNo matter the reason, it's nice to have a straight forward way to redact\ninformation from photos, and Obfuscate is that exact tool. Maybe you'll never\nneed it, but the one time you do, you'll be glad you have it.\n\nYou can download Obfuscate from Flathub in the link below.\n\nDownload Obfuscate\n\n## File Shredder\n\nLosing or accidentally deleting a file can be a real headache. Sometimes,\ntrying to get back the photo or file you accidentally trashed can be quite\ndifficult, though not impossible. Other times that's exactly what you need.\n\nFile Shredder is here to make any deleted file stay that way. Deleting a file\nwith File Shredder instead of manually in your file manager is a more secure\nand permanent way to do so.\n\nDigital file shredding is a process of obfuscation that writes random data\nover the content of your previous files. This makes those files irrecoverable.\n\nFile Shredder implements this using its own internal shredding code rather\nthan an external option. Just open the app, point it at the files you want to\ndelete, and click the shred button. It's that simple.\n\nLike the programs listed before it, File Shredder is dumb simple to use, and\nit's available to download from Flathub.\n\n[Download File\nShredder}(https://flathub.org/apps/com.github.ADBeveridge.Raider)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThere you have it, three desktop GNU/Linux applications to help boost your\ndigital privacy. I've needed all three in the past, and I hope you find them\nhalf as useful as I do.\n\nNow, these apps aren't going to inherently make you more private on their own\nor anything, but they can certainly become useful free software tools on your\nprivacy journey.\n\nWhat do you think? Don't like my picks? Think I left something out? Feel free\nto let me know in the comments below. I'd love to hear your feedback.\n\nTags: #Apps Comments: Discuss...\n\n", "frontpage": false}
