Citi CFO Mark Mason said today that\nthe bank expects to make annualized run rate savings of $1.5bn a year from\nthose 7,000 job cuts. This means the bank was spending an average of no more\nthan $214k on each of those people, including employer's taxes.\n\nThe implication is that as Citi stripped out five layers of management and\nhalved its internal governance committees, most of the people disassociated\nfrom their jobs were comparatively junior. As we've noted before, at the top\nof the hierarchy many heads of division were retained as \"chairmen\" in their\nbusiness areas.\n\nCiti CEO Jane Fraser said today that the cuts were \"the most consequential set\nof changes\" Citi has made, and that they've enabled both her and Mason to run\nthe bank like \"operators\" instead of people running a holding company. \"It's\nmuch easier to get things done,\" she added.\n\nCutting juniors is perhaps inevitable given the pyramidal structure of banking\nhierarchies and the fact that Citi wants to remove 20,000 people by 2026.\nHowever, the cuts are equally a reminder that even when a bank is explicitly\ntrimming its 'management hierarchy', it's more junior staff who are often most\naffected.\n\nCiti also said today that it spent $258m on \"repositioning costs\" as it cut\nthe 7,000 people, implying that severance payments were more than $37k each.\n\nCiti's layoffs aren't over. The bank wants to cut 20,000 people in total, and\nso has 13,000 still to go, of which 5,000 are expected to come from business\ndivestments and the remainder are expected to come from technology and support\nteams.\n\nThis doesn't mean there won't be more cuts in the investment bank. Some teams\nare likely to be safe, though. Citi said today that prime services revenues\nare thriving. It's also focusing on technology, healthcare and industrials\nsector teams in investment banking, which it says now account for a combined\n50%+ of its banking revenues.\n\nHave a confidential story, tip, or comment you\u2019d like to share?
