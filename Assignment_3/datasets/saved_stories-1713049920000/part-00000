The storm developed south of Sydney on the afternoon of Wednesday, 14\nApril 1999, and struck the city's eastern suburbs, including the central\nbusiness district, later that evening.^[1]\n\nThe storm dropped an estimated 500,000 tonnes of hailstones in its\npath.^[2]^[3] The insured damage bill caused by the storm was over A$1.7\nbillion (equivalent to $3.8 billion in 2022),^[4] with the total bill\n(including uninsured damage) estimated to be around $2.3 billion.^[5]^[6] It\nwas the costliest single natural disaster in Australian history in insured\ndamage, surpassing the $1.1 billion in insured damage caused by the 1989\nNewcastle earthquake. Lightning also claimed one life during the storm, and\nthe event caused approximately 50 injuries.^[7]^[8]\n\nThe storm was classified as a supercell following further analysis of its\nerratic nature and extreme attributes. During the event, the Bureau of\nMeteorology was constantly surprised by the frequent changes in direction, as\nwell as the severity of the hail and the duration of the storm. The event was\nalso surprising as neither the time of year, time of day, nor the general\nmeteorological conditions in the region were seen as conducive for extreme\nstorm cell formation.^[4]^[9]\n\n## Conditions and climatology\n\nThe conditions around Sydney on Wednesday, 14 April were calm, although a\nslight instability in atmospheric conditions was recorded by the Bureau of\nMeteorology in the region. Two instability events had been identified in the\ngreater Sydney area, but both were considered minor by the meteorological\nagencies. A weak cold front was moving north along the coast, and moderate\nprecipitation was falling over the Blue Mountains, southwest of the city. The\nmeteorological reports and figures, however, suggested that the general\natmospheric conditions were \"not conducive\" to support the formation of a\nmajor thunderstorm in the region.^[10]\n\nHistorical records show that the formation of severe thunderstorms for the\ntime of day and year had been rare, and it was improbable that they would\nmaintain their intensity and cause significant damage.^[11]^[12] This long-\nstanding belief contributed to the Bureau of Meteorology's decision not to\nissue warnings in the early part of the storm's development.^[10] The 1999\nevent was only the second time in recorded history that hail larger than 2 cm\n(0.8 in) had fallen in the Sydney metropolitan area in the month of\nApril,^[13] and only the fifth hailstorm to strike Sydney during April in the\n200 years of meteorological records for the city.^[14]\n\nHailstorms have had a history of significant damage in Australia. Since\nrecords on insured losses by the Insurance Disaster Response Organisation\nbegan in 1967 three other hailstorms \u2013 Sydney in 1986 and 1990, as well as\nBrisbane in 1985 \u2013 feature on the top-ten list of most insured damage caused\nby a single natural disaster, in addition to the 1999 storm. Hailstorms have\ncaused more than 30% of all insured damage inflicted as a result of natural\ndisasters in Australia during this period, and around three-quarters of all\nhailstorm damage has occurred in New South Wales.^[4]\n\n## Development of the storm\n\n### Formation and southern Sydney\n\nPath of the storm from formation and in the southern regions of Sydney\n\nThe storm cell formed at 4:25 pm AEST to the north of Nowra, roughly 115 km\n(71 mi) south-southwest of Sydney. After forming, it initially headed towards\nthe coast in a northeasterly direction. The cell passed just to the west of\nKiama at around 5:15 pm and gained a 'severe' classification from the Bureau\nof Meteorology at the same time.^[15] 'Severe' is a classification used by the\nBureau of Meteorology for thunderstorms which meet a specific criteria, namely\nproducing hailstones with a diameter of 2 cm (0.8 in) or more, wind gusts of\n90 km/h (56 mph) or greater and flash flooding, or tornadoes. This\nclassification is also used by the Bureau to classify the attributes of a\nstorm at any given time during its life.^[7]^[16]\n\nThe storm continued to move in a northeasterly direction, crossing the coast\njust north of Kiama at 5:25 pm. It was downgraded from a severe thunderstorm\nand proceeded to move further off the coast for another 15 minutes while\ngaining speed to around 37 km/h (23 mph). The storm then veered northward at\n5:40 pm and continued parallel to the coast. Around 6:00 pm, directly east of\nWollongong, the storm changed direction again, this time to north-northeast,\nand continued parallel to the coastline. Moderate hailstones were recorded\nfalling in Wollongong as the western edge of the storm passed over the area,\nand the storm was reclassified as severe.^[15]\n\nThe storm moved parallel to the coast in a north-northeasterly direction for\nthe next fifty minutes. It maintained a severe classification though did not\nimpact heavily on the coastal suburbs, because it was entirely offshore. The\nwestern edge of the storm, however, recrossed the coastline just east of\nHelensburgh, 40 km (25 mi) south-southwest of Sydney, at about 7:00 pm. Ten\nminutes later the direction of the storm veered slightly more northward and\nthe centre of the storm crossed back onto land at Bundeena at around 7:20\npm.^[17]\n\n### Immediate Sydney region\n\nPath of the storm over the eastern suburbs area of Sydney\n\nThe Bureau of Meteorology had not issued warnings for Sydney Airport, located\non the northern shore of Botany Bay, or the rest of the eastern suburbs to\nprepare for large hail. They were not expecting the storm to veer northward\nagain, but rather to continue to head further out into the Tasman Sea in a\nconsistent north-northeasterly direction.^[17]^[18]\n\nAfter crossing the coast, the storm continued to move northward, crossing\nBotany Bay at 7:40 pm and reaching the Airport five minutes later. It\ntravelled across the eastern suburbs between Botany Bay and Sydney Harbour\nbetween 7:45 pm and 8:05 pm, dropping massive hailstones on both houses and\nbusinesses in the eastern suburbs district and the central business\ndistrict.^[17] Some of the largest hailstones ever recorded in the Sydney\nregion fell on the eastern suburbs during this storm. There were reports of 13\ncm (5.1 in) diameter hailstones in the eastern suburbs, although the largest\nconfirmed hailstone was 9 cm (3.5 in) in diameter.^[19] It was the first time\nin 52 years that stones greater than 8 cm (3.1 in) had fallen in Sydney, with\nthe last reported event being the 1947 hailstorm.^[14]\n\nThe storm continued across Sydney Harbour and changed direction slightly to be\nheading north. It weakened after travelling over the Harbour, and was\ndowngraded from a severe storm at 8:15 pm. The Bureau of Meteorology had\nconcluded that the storm would weaken after heading across Sydney Harbour,\nbelieving it was dissipating and would therefore not produce any more\nsubstantial hail as it moved northward; therefore it did not issue warnings\nfor the northern suburbs.^[11]^[18]\n\n### Northern Suburbs and dissipation\n\nPath of the storm after crossing Sydney Harbour until dissipating\n\nThe storm then continued north for twenty minutes over the North Shore suburbs\nof Sydney before regaining strength and veering north-northwest again,\nredeveloping severe thunderstorm characteristics. The storm's redevelopment\nagain caught the Bureau of Meteorology off-guard, who had expected the storm\nto dissipate and move out to sea without causing further substantial\ndamage.^[17]\n\nIt proceeded to drop large amounts of hail on the northern beach suburbs of\nMona Vale and Palm Beach around 8:50 pm, and the centre of the storm again\ncrossed the coast and back out to sea just after 9:00 pm. The storm maintained\nits intensity, however, and continued to move in a northwesterly direction\nacross Broken Bay. The western edge of the storm had a minor impact on\nsouthern suburbs of the Central Coast between 9:15 pm and 9:30 pm.^[17]\n\nThe storm moved entirely off the coastline and into open water at around 9:45\npm. It then dissipated rapidly around 9:55 pm, directly east of Gosford. It\nwas subsequently downgraded from severe status and the storm cell had faded\ncompletely by 10:00 pm.^[1]\n\n## Aftermath\n\n### Secondary storm cell\n\nThe Bureau of Meteorology radar image from 8:10 pm, showing the first cell\ndirectly over the Sydney central business district and the second cell\napproximately 80 km (50 mi) south along the coastline\n\nA second, far smaller storm cell passed along a similar route to the first\nlater in the evening of 14 April. This cell was never given the classification\nof 'severe' by the Bureau of Meteorology, nor did it develop into a supercell\nlike its predecessor.^[20] Therefore, the route of the second cell was more\ndirect and predictable than the first, following the general movement of the\ncold front (see conditions and climatology), and the Bureau of Meteorology\nissued warnings to all residents in the second cell's projected path to expect\nfurther storm activity.^[21]\n\nThe secondary cell passed through Sydney two hours later than the first, just\nafter 10:00 pm, having been approximately 80 km (50 mi) south of Sydney when\nthe supercell struck. It dropped hail up to 2 cm (0.8 in) in diameter, as well\nas producing heavy rainfall. Damage caused by the second cell was mostly due\nto rain coming in through roofs already damaged by hail from the first cell.\nHail from the second cell also contributed to the damage.^[12]^[22]\n\n### Damage caused\n\nThe downpour of an estimated 500,000 tonnes of hail across Sydney suburbia\nresulted in widespread damage on the coastal suburbs in its path.^[2]^[3]\nInsured losses due to the disaster reached roughly A$1.7 billion, with total\ncosts estimated to be around A$2.3 billion.^[5]^[6] The storm was the\ncostliest natural disaster ever to hit Australia in terms of insured losses,\nsurpassing the 1989 Newcastle earthquake by around A$600 million.^[4] The\nareas that incurred the most damage were between Lilli Pilli and Darling\nPoint, located 25 km (16 mi) apart on the coastline of Sydney.^[23]\n\nThe vast majority of damage was done by hail and rain. Approximately 24,000\nhouses were significantly damaged, with many suffering water damage through\nthe holes in roofs that the large hailstones created. The stones were\nestimated as travelling at up to 200 km/h (120 mph) in some periods of the\nstorm, causing indentation damage to around 70,000 vehicles.^[24] Twenty-three\naeroplanes and helicopters at Sydney Airport were reported as having incurred\nnotable damage from the hail, caused by the inability to place them under\nhangars in time to avoid the storm. This has been significantly attributed to\na lack of warnings from the Bureau of Meteorology, who had expected the storm\nto continue moving further out into the Tasman Sea in the north-northeasterly\ndirection in which it had previously been travelling.^[17]\n\nThe most significant insurance costs were in the areas of residential property\ndamage with 31.8% of total payments, motor vehicle damage with 28.6% and for\nproperties which service the commercial and industrial sectors at 27.5%.\nDamage to aviation property, mainly planes at the vulnerable Sydney Airport,\namounted to 5.9% of the claims, while 5.8% of all insurance payments were made\nfor 'business interruption' and 0.4% for damage to boats as well as other\nmiscellaneous claims.^[24]\n\nThe storm caused one fatality; a 45-year-old man, who was fishing about 100\nmetres (300 ft) from the north shore of Dolans Bay in the Port Hacking\nestuary, was killed when his boat was struck by lightning.^[5] Fifty injuries\nwere recorded, caused by flying objects, road accidents due to poor visibility\nand smashed windscreens and other factors.^[8]^[22]\n\n### Emergency response\n\nThe aftermath of the storm, Darlinghurst, inner-city Sydney\n\nOwing to the magnitude of the storm, the State Emergency Service were aided by\nthe New South Wales Rural Fire Service, the New South Wales Fire Brigades and\nthe Australian Capital Territory Emergency Service in recovery work.^[4]\nWithin hours of the storm striking the city, all affected areas were declared\nas 'disaster zones' and the New South Wales Government, under Premier Bob\nCarr, invoked a state of emergency, which gave control and co-ordination of\nthe response to the State Emergency Service.^[25] In the days following the\nstorm, John Moore (Minister for Defence) approved a request for 300 Australian\nDefence Force personnel to assist recovery operations, although their\nassistance was only for one week while resources were stretched. The\ngovernment, one week later, \"unexpectedly\" removed complete control from the\nState Emergency Service and placed certain suburbs and areas under the control\nof the Rural Fire Service and Fire Brigade.^[25]^[26]\n\nIn the five hours following the storm striking Sydney, the State Emergency\nService received 2,000 emergency calls to 1,092 separate incidents.^[27] In\ntotal, the State Emergency Service received 25,301 calls for assistance to\n15,007 incidents, with the New South Wales Rural Fire Service also receiving\n19,437.^[28] The recovery and clean-up mission used an estimated A$10 million\nworth of tarpaulin covers while waiting for permanent repairs.^[24]\n\nAfter nine days, approximately 3,000 buildings (out of a total of 127,947\ninitially damaged) were still waiting for assistance and temporary fixes to\nshattered roofs and windows, while a similar number still required assistance\na further week later (as a number of tarpaulins became detached or otherwise\nineffective).^[4]^[26] One month after the disaster, the main priority of the\nemergency services was ensuring that temporary fixes remained in place, as\nSydney suffered further adverse weather in the period immediately following\nthe storm.^[25]^[26]\n\nA study of samples taken of affected areas suggested that roughly 62% of\nbuildings in the affected areas suffered damage to roofs, around 34% to\nwindows and 53% to vehicles.^[12] Construction of infrastructure for the 2000\nSydney Olympics in the city's west at the time meant there was a deficiency of\ntradespeople who could be contracted to repair roofs and windows. Estimates\nput between 45,000 and 50,000 tradespeople in Sydney at the time of the storm,\nyet owing to high demand \"companies were quoting householders A$14,000 or more\nfor roof repairs which would normally cost $3,000.\"^[26] The situation led to\na warning from the Minister for Fair Trade, John Watkins, on the day following\nthe storm, urging homeowners to ensure that tradespeople working to repair\nhomes were fully qualified and legitimate.^[29]\n\n## See also\n\n  * Earth sciences portal\n\n  * Emergency management\n  * List of disasters in Australia by death toll\n  * Severe storms in Australia\n  * Severe storm events in Sydney\n\n## References\n\n### Citations\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b Zillman (1999), 19.\n  2. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b Steingold, et al.
