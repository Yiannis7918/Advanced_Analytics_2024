Over the years many brave gamers have\nwhole-heartedly taken up the challenge to restore a mixed Rubik's cube to it's\ncolorful and perfect original configuration, only to find the solution\nlingering just out of their grasp time and time again. After spending hours\nand days twisting and turning the vaunted cube in vain, many resorted to\nremoving and replacing the multi-colored facelets of the cube in a dastardly\nattempt to cheat the seemingly infallible logic of the cube, while others\nsimply tossed it to the side and dubbed it impossible. The Rubik's cube, it\nseemed, had defeated all.\n\nHumanity required a solution, so intelligent gamers went to work to take down\nthe so-called \"frustration cube\". Amazingly, not only did they discover a\nsolution, they formulated many of them, ranging from beginner-level to\nadvanced. One of these bright bulbs was Denny Dedmore. Not only did he\ndiscover an efficient and fool-proof solution for solving the cube, he also\nprovided several amazing \"algorithms\" (move-sequences) which made following\nhis talented solution very simple. Mr. Dedmore completed his now easy-to-\nmaster solution by inventing the brilliant move notation found throughout the\nguide, which made explaining the various twists and turns necessary to solve\nthe Rubiks cube visually understandable.\n\nNow spreading bad grammar and randomness via Twitter.  \n---  \n  \nWe are proud to bring you the stunning Rubiks cube strategy guide originally\ndeveloped by Denny Dedmore, now optimized and refreshed by Chess and Poker Dot\nCom, that will allow all of us to claim vindication and defeat the previously\nunbeatable Rubik's cube. Take your time, work through all of the steps until\nyou understand them and you'll be able to successfully solve the rubik's cube.\nFinally!\n\n## Rubiks Cube Terminology and Move Notation\n\nThe terms used in the Rubiks cube strategy guide are well-known to the cubing\nworld. The squares that make up the Rubiks cube are known as Cubies. The\ncolored stickers on the fronts of all the Cubies are known as Facelets. There\nare three types of Cubies: Corners, Edges and Center Cubies. Corners have\nthree facelets, edges have two and the center Cubies have only one facelet.\nNotice that in our graphic there is also a label under one side of the cube\nthat says \"Front\". Since all of the diagrams are shown at an angle, also\nshowing the right and top sides of the cube, it's important to always look at\nthe cube from the front perspective when making your moves. Showing the cube\nat an angle is necessary because you will have to make different sets of moves\nbased on various arrangements of Cubies on both of these other two sides.\n\nThis group of notation graphics indicate which direction the various\nhorizontal rows of the Rubiks cube should be turned. There are 3 different\nrows.\n\nThis group of notation graphics indicate which direction the various vertical\ncolumns of the Rubiks cube should be turned. There are 3 different columns.\n\nThese notation graphics indicate which direction the entire front face of the\ncube should be turned.\n\nNow that you know the terminology used throughout the strategy guide, let's\nlearn how to understand the move notation graphics. Utilizing the Rubik's cube\nmove notation chart, you can find the definitions of each tiny graphic. The\nfirst two sets show which horizontal row or vertical column should be moved,\nand in which direction. When looking at the front of the cube, the top three\nhorizontal Cubies make up the top row. The middle horizontal row of cubies\n(from the top or bottom) make up the middle row, and finally the bottom three\nhorizontal cubies make up the bottom row. So what about the columns? Still\nlooking at the front of the cube, the three vertical cubies on the left make\nup the left column. Then the next three vertical cubies make up the middle\ncolumn and the last three vertical cubies make up the right column. But what\nabout the looping arrow notation graphics?\n\nWhen you are looking directly at the front of the cube, which you should\nalways be doing, the nine Cubies with various facelets that you see are known\nas the front face of the cube. When you see the \"turning arrow\" notation\ngraphics from the third set, they are instructing you to turn all nine of\nthese cubies at the same time to either the right (clockwise) or left\n(counter-clockwise). So instead of moving individual rows or columns, when you\nsee these graphics you should turn the entire front face of the cube to the\ndirection indicated. Using these and the other notation graphics explained\nabove you are now ready to begin solving the cube. But before you begin, we\nsuggest that you first play around with the cube for a while and try to\nunderstand these moves and how they move the various parts of the cube around.\nSome of the moves can be a bit tricky for your fingers. For example, when you\nare moving a middle row or column, you in fact must move two columns or rows,\nand then turn the non-middle one back to it's previous spot. This is because\nthe middle rows or columns do not move independently. Don't forget to move the\nother row or column back! Once you are comfortable with all of the moves, it's\ntime to solve.\n\n## The Seven-Step Guide to Solving a Rubiks cube\n\nTo begin the solution, we must first prime the cube. To do so, simply pick a\ncorner cubie and turn it so that it is the upper-right-hand corner cubie on\nthe front of your cube. It can be any color, but for our example we will be\nusing the Blue-Red-White corner as shown, with the white facelet on the front,\nthe red facelet on the right and the blue facelet on the top. Then, you must\nturn the rest of the cube around until the top color of your selected first\ncorner cubie also matches the center. Our top color is blue so we must turn\nthe blue center cubie around to the top of the cube. You can move the Blue\ncenter around in any direction you want until it arrives at the correct top-\ncenter position as shown. By priming the cube in this way, you have already\nsolved two of the top row cubies. We are now ready to solve the rest of the\ncube.\n\nWe used (and pretty much destroyed) our Collector's Edition Rubik's Cube when\ndeveloping our Rubik's cube guide.\n\n## Step One: Place the Top Row Corners\n\nSince we have solved the first corner of our top row when we primed it, we are\nnow ready to solve the other three. To do so, you must turn the entire cube\n(not any rows, columns or faces) to the left so that your original corner\ncubie is now the upper-left-hand corner on the front of the cube. In our\nexample, you can see that the upper-left-hand corner is now the original blue-\nred-white corner with the blue and red facelets showing on the graphic (since\nwe turned the entire cube to the left). We now need to solve the upper-right-\nhand corner again, so we must figure out which corner to put there. In fact,\nthis is quite easy. Since the mystery cubie must have blue on it (otherwise it\nwon't match the rest of the top color), and it must also have red on it (or it\nwon't make a full-red side with the first red facelet there), we simply must\nfind the other corner on the cube with blue and red on it. On our cube, this\nwould be the Blue-Red-Yellow cubie.\n\nThe next step is to maneuver this target cubie to the bottom-right-hand corner\nof the cube (shown here in black to help demonstrate the target location). The\nblue, red and yellow facelets on this cubie can be in any order and on any\nside as long as the cubie is in its proper spot. Simply turn the bottom row\naround (without disturbing the top row) until your target cubie is in its\nplace. Once the cubie is at the bottom-right-hand corner on the front,\ndepending on the location of the top color (Blue) we will choose one of the\nfollowing algorithms to move it up to the top-right-hand corner and flip it\naround to line it up properly.\n\nFor example, if our Blue-Red-Yellow cubie happens to have the blue facelet\nshowing on the right side of the cube (position 1) we would use the first\nalgorithm. If instead it was on the front side (position 2) we would use the\nsecond algorithm. Finally, if the Blue facelet is on the bottom of the cubie\n(position 3, indicated by the hand pointing to the bottom) you would use the\nthird algorithm.\n\nIt may also happen that the target Blue-Red-Yellow Cubie is already in its\nproper top-row position but it is not facing the right way (the red facelet is\nnot on the same side as the original red facelet). If the Blue facelet is on\nthe front (position 4) use the fourth algorithm, and of course if it is on the\nright side of the cubie (position 5) use the fifth algorithm. If your desired\ncubie is trapped in the middle layer, simply skip to another corner and once\nyou solve it the target cubie will have been forced back into the top or\nbottom row. When you are finished with the corners, your cube will have a Blue\n\"X\" on the top with all of the corner colors matching up horizontally with\ntheir partners.\n\n## Step Two: Place the Edges and Finish the Top Layer\n\nNow that we know the general ideas on how to find the proper target cubie and\nthen move it into position, we're ready to finish the top layer. Keeping the\nabove concepts in mind, we must now find the target edge cubies (those that\nwill complete the top row) and move them into the new target positions, again\ncolored black here. Simply turn the bottom and middle layers until the target\ncubie is in one of these spots, and based on which side the top color (blue)\nis on, select from the following algorithms to move it into its place. When\nyou are finished with step two, the entire top layer of the cube is solved.\n\n## Step Three: Align the Centers and Place the Middle Layer Edges\n\nTo begin step 3, you must first turn the middle layer around so that the\ncenter cubies in the middle layer all match with their top layer counterparts.\nIn our example, you can see that the red center and yellow center match up\nwith their respective colors above them. This is known as forming the Half-T.\nOnce you have the centers aligned, you've already partially solved the middle\nlayer. The only thing left to do is place the remaining edges.\n\nNow, turning only the bottom row, we will position the target cubie so that it\nwill match up with its same-color center forming the Full-T. In our example,\nwe have turned the bottom row around so that we have formed a Full Red T on\nthe front of the cube. We may be ready to place this cube into position, but\nwe must first check to make sure it is indeed the correct edge. On our cube,\nwe would need the bottom of the Red T cubie to be either Yellow (which when\nmoved to the right would match up with the Red and Yellow centers) or the Red-\nWhite cubie (which on our cube could be moved left, matching up with the Red\nand White centers). If this edge cannot connect either of the two centers to\nthe left or right, or it is upside down (there is not a T formed, the Red\nfacelet is improperly on the bottom) you must move on to another T formation.\nThere will almost always be another T immediately possible. Here are the\nalgorithms you'll use to move the target cubie to the left or right as needed:\n\nLeft Right\n\nIf you find that no T is possible, or that the correct edge is in the proper\nposition but is turned around so that the colors do not match up, simply place\na random cubie into its place by performing either of the algorithms once,\nwhich will force the proper cubie back to the bottom. Occasionally, you will\nhave to do this several times to get the positioning correct. When you have\nfinished, your cube will have both the top and middle layers fully solved.\n\n## Step Four: Turn the Cube Over and Arrange the Last Layer Corners\n\nNow you'll turn the entire cube upside down (the Blue top now becomes the\nbottom) and arrange the last unfinished layer (Green) corners into their\ncorrect positions, although not yet finished. On our cube, the front face is\nthe red side. So the correct corners for the front (labeled as 1 and 2) must\nboth have Green and Red facelets on them so they'll match up with the bottom\ntwo layers we've already solved and also the Green top. Using this logic, the\nback side of our cube is Orange so the back corners (labeled as 3 and 4) must\nboth then contain Green and Orange facelets. Furthermore, all the final\ncorners must also be on their correct sides. For example, on our cube the\nGreen-Red-White corner must be in position 1 and the Green-Red-Yellow corner\nmust be in position 2. Once we are ready to finish them in the next step they\nmust be ready to match up with all three colors.\n\nRemember, we aren't trying to completely solve these final corners yet, just\nmoving them into place to be finished in the next step. As an example, on the\nmini-cube to the right you can see that the Green-Red-White corner is in the\ncorrect position but not yet finished (the green facelet is on the front, the\nwhite facelet is on the top etc). The Green-Orange-White cubie on the back\nright side is also in the correct position, but obviously not matching up\ncorrectly yet (the orange facelet is on the white side). However, that's all\nyou have to do for this step! We'll be flipping all of these corners around to\nfinish them in Step Five. Here are the maneuvers used to arrange the corners\ninto their correct positions, although not yet solved:\n\nSwitch 1 and 2 Switch 1 and 3\n\nMany times you can take a look around the unfinished top layer and find the\ntwo Red corners already side-by-side. If that's the case, just turn the top\nlayer around so that both Red corners are on the Red front (without disturbing\nthe two finished layers below of course). Then you'll just have to use the\n\"Switch One and Two\" maneuver to move them back and forth to the proper sides.\nConcerning the Orange corners, you must turn the entire cube around (not\nmoving any rows or columns) so that the Orange side is now the front. Then you\ncan perform the switching maneuvers as needed. If two Reds are diagonal from\none another (the red corners are currently at positions 2 and 3), perform the\n\"Switch One and Three\" maneuver to bring them side-by-side. When you have\nfinished this step, your cube will have the corners arranged to their proper\npositions, but probably not yet finished.\n\n## Step Five: Completely Finish the Last Layer Corners\n\nIn this step, we will flip all of the last layer corners around into their\nfinal finished positions. On our cube, Green is the last layer color. To solve\nthe corners, we will focus on three different configurations concerning the\nGreen facelets. Using the graphic to the left, hold your cube so that when you\nare looking at the front you can see any of these Green facelet configurations\nexactly as shown. For this step, none of the other remaining facelets (or the\nrest of the cube) matter so they are not shown, including any other Green\nfacelets on the last layer. Once you've located one of the three arrangements,\nperform the following algorithm:\n\nSeveral times\n\nRemember that while two of the configurations (the middle and bottom) require\nthe green facelets be located on the right side of the cube, it's still\nnecessary to perform the algorithm above from the front. You'll have to\nperform this algorithm several times, and you'll need to use at least two of\nthe three different configurations to continue (finding the same configuration\nover and over again will just get you stuck). If you couldn't find one of the\nstarting configurations to begin this step, perform the algorithm once and\nthen you'll be able to find one of them.\n\n## Step Six: Completely Finish Two Edges and Prepare the Remaining Two\n\nYou should now find that you have also placed at least one of the remaining\nlast layer edges into its final position, although not necessarily turned\naround correctly. Turn the entire cube around so that the side with a\ncorrectly positioned edge is now the front (in some cases, you'll have a\ncouple to choose from). In our diagram, the side with the Green-White edge is\nthe front because the edge is in its proper place (just needing to be flipped\nover). Then perform the following repositioning algorithm to move the rest of\nthe edges into their proper places (up to two times). If you couldn't find a\ncorrectly positioned edge to start with, perform the algorithm once from any\nfront and then proceed as usual.\n\nFrom the Correctly-Positioned Edge Side\n\n## Step Seven: Solve the Rubik's Cube\n\nWe are now ready to completely solve the Rubik's cube. At this point, only the\nlast unfinished layer concerns us so the rest of the cube is not shown. In\nalmost all cases, there will be two edges completely solved after finishing\nstep six above, and two edges unsolved. The two unsolved edges, however, are\nnow properly positioned on their correct sides and simply need to be turned\naround to be finished. Turn the entire cube around until the last two unsolved\nedges match up to either of the graphics shown to the left when looking at the\nfront of the cube. In our graphic, the completely solved cubies of the last\nlayer are shown in Pink, and the two unsolved edges are shown in Purple.\n\nOnce you are ready, perform the applicable last layer algorithm below to\ncompletely solve the cube. The first is known as the \"H\" Pattern, and the\nsecond is known as the \"Fish Pattern\". If for some reason you had all four\nedges flipped (instead of the usual two edges) when you finished step six,\nsimply perform the \"H\" Pattern once from any front. You will then be able to\nfind either of the two original patterns at that point.
