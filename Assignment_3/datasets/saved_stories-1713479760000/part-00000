We've come across examples of\ncompanies coming up with fictional, AI-generated material as set dressing \u2014a\nrecent episode of HBO's \"True Detective\" featured bizarre, AI-generated\nposters in the background of a shot. But resorting to the tech to generate\npictures of a real person, especially of somebody who's still in jail and will\nonly be eligible for parole around 2040, should raise some alarm bells.\n\nThis isn't inventing a fictional narrative for the sake of entertainment \u2014\nthis is tinkering with the fabric of reality itself to manipulate a true story\nthat actually happened.\n\nFuturism has reached out to Netflix for comment.\n\nMore on AI-generated images in media: [UPDATED] AI-Generated Poster Confirmed\nin \"True Detective\"\n\nShare This Article\n\nAI Romcom\n\nThe First AI-Generated Romcom Is Coming Out This Summer\n\nApr 16, 5:30 PM EDT\n\nRead More\n\nEmad and Satya Sitting in a Tree\n\nOusted Founder of Stability AI Seen Meeting With Microsoft CEO\n\nMar 26, 2:00 PM EDT\n\nRead More\n\nInnkeeper 3000\n\nUbisoft Shows Off AI-Powered NPC That Can Talk Back\n\nMar 20, 1:08 PM EDT\n\nRead More\n\nFacebook Boomers\n\nFacebook Is Making Insane AI-Generated Fever Dreams Go Viral for Gullible\nBoomers\n\nMar 19, 2:25 PM EDT\n\nRead More\n\n+Social+Newsletter\n\nTopicsAbout UsEditorial StandardsContact Us\n\nDISCLAIMER(S)\n\nPrivacy PolicyTerms & ConditionsDMCA Policy\n\nArticles may contain affiliate links which enable us to share in the revenue\nof any purchases made.\n\nRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our Terms of\nService.\n\n\u00a9 Recurrent Ventures Inc, All Rights Reserved.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
