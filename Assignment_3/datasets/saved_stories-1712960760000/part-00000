This book gives you the theory behind\nescapement design and associated issues and will allow you to create your own\nescapement design, complete with schematic line-drawings, tables, charts and\nthe formulas needed for setting up escapement design and testing from your\ncomputer (the menu below shows the results of this, in motion, although the\nresults do not show the method, which is where the knowledge is learned!).\nProfessional clock repairmen and amateurs can benefit from this theoretical\ntreatment of the timepieces they are working on -- how they were designed and\nwhy. Regardless of what timepiece you are working on, ranging from an antique\ngrandfather clock to a modern wristwatch, this insight can improve your\nability to repair and adjust any mechanical timepiece that uses escapements.\nYou can now read the entire book online: Clock and Watch Escapement Mechanics.\nYou can download my book to read off line as a free EBOOK (pdf).\n\nHere is the most exciting part of this website: computer simulations of the\nWatch and Clock Escapements in motion! I sure hope you will enjoy them because\nI spent an enormous number of hours creating each one, and even longer to\ncreate the animated files from each drawing. For example, I spent a total of\nabout 25 hours on the Chronometer Escapement. The least amount of time spent\ncreating an animated file was about 6 hours (for the Cylinder Escapement). The\nanimations are intended to show viewers how each escapement is supposed to\nwork, as this is designed to be a website for horological education! Knowing\nhow each escapement is supposed to work would help you in designing or\nrepairing timepieces, from antique clock repair to modern wristwatch design.\nEach animation may take a long couple of minutes to prepare itself, but seeing\nthese complicated animated files in action is well worth the long wait. Be\npatient. If the animation does not work properly the first time, you may need\nto reload the page.\n\nDaniel's Double Wheel Watch EscapementDaniel's Coaxial Watch EscapementSwiss\nLever Watch EscapementEnglish Lever Watch EscapementCylinder Watch\nEscapementDuplex Watch EscapementChronometer Clock (or Watch) EscapementGraham\nClock EscapementRecoil Clock EscapementBrocot Clock EscapementPin Wheel Clock\nEscapementGravity Clock EscapementGrasshopper Clock EscapementA Modified Clock\nEscapementAnother Modified Clock Escapement  \n---  \n  \nHere is a history essay about escapements as presented in the April, 2002\nissue of the IEEE Control Systems magazine, The Origin and Evolution of the\nAnchor Clock Escapement.
