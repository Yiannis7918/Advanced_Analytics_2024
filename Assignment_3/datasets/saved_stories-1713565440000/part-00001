This standard takes inspiration from the globally recognised GHG\nProtocol and its emissions classification into Scopes 1, 2, and 3.\n\n## Why a New Standard?\n\nThe goal of this Technology Carbon Standard is to provide a standardised model\nof tech emissions that can help organisations when mapping out, measuring or\nimproving the environmental impacts of their technology estate. This fills a\ngap between high-level consultancy guidance and specific projects tackling\nindividual areas like cloud computing. Consistent standards facilitate\nproductive conversations between sustainability stakeholders, technology\nleadership and practitioners.\n\nBy delineating an organisation's technology estate into categories analogous\nto GHG Protocol scopes, technology practitioners can more easily identify the\nmost carbon-intensive areas to prioritise for impact reduction. This is not\nintended to reinvent existing efforts in sustainability measurement and\nreporting. Where relevant, the methodology references and integrates with\nestablished open-source initiatives for calculating technology emissions.\n\n## Technology Carbon Standard\n\nCategory\n\nCarbon Standard Category\n\n1/2/3\n\nGHG Protocol Scope\n\n### Upstream Emissions\n\nCategory U\n\n3\n\nUpstream emissions relating to the embodied carbon of hardware and the\ndevelopment of software.\n\n#### Software\n\nOff The Shelf including Open-Source Software\n\n#### Hardware Manufacture, Transport and Installation\n\nUser Hardware (laptops, printers, etc.)\n\nNetworking and Infrastructure Hardware\n\nServers and Storage Hardware\n\n### Operational Emissions\n\nOperational emissions are associated to the running of business IT functions\nand systems.
