That means, you can skip this automated script, and configure it\nmanually, using:\n\n    \n    \n    STARTUP=/sdcard/.adb/startup.sh alias adb-shell=\"adb shell -t \\\"HOME='/sdcard' ENV='$STARTUP' sh -i\\\"\"\n\nThe startup.sh is actually .mksh file for android, so if you want to config it\nmanually, you can.\n\nWhen you want to apply changes, run the following command: adb push startup.sh\n$STARTUP\n\n# Contribute\n\nOn all errors, problems or suggestions please open a GitHub issue\n\nIf you found this script useful, it would be great if you could buy me a\ncoffee:\n\n## About\n\nbetter `adb shell`\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\nActivity\n\n### Stars\n\n4 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n1 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n0 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases\n\nNo releases published\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Languages\n\n  * Shell 88.9%\n  * PowerShell 11.1%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
