Any notion of defeat was\nunthinkable, an almost taboo topic.\n\nBut now the question hovers, flitting in and out of view: What if?\n\nThe stalling of crucial American aid, a distinct dimming of the world\nspotlight, and simple war weariness are all exacting a heavy cost. On the\nfront lines, exhausted Ukrainian troops are rationing ammunition as they fend\noff the latest Russian advances, and anxiety is mounting along with the\nmilitary and civilian toll.\n\n\u201cEvery day, we\u2019re dying,\u201d said Marta Tomakhiv, 33, standing in a sharp-edged\nshadow in Kyiv\u2019s main Independence Square, mourning a friend from her western\nUkrainian hometown who was killed in battle days earlier in the east.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Ukrainian serviceman with howitzer weaponry in the Donetsk region of eastern\nUkraine on April 11, 2024.\n\n(Alex Babenko / Associated Press)\n\nBy and large, Ukrainians still believe they can hold out against a resurgent\nand powerful foe \u2014 if for no other reason, as nearly everyone here points out,\nthan that they are in a fight for their lives.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no choice \u2014 we know very well what they would do to us if\nthey could,\u201d Artem Morhun, a 30-year-old lawyer on his way to work in downtown\nKyiv, said of the invading Russian forces.\n\nFew Ukrainians have forgotten the brutal atrocities carried out by occupying\nRussian troops in Kyiv\u2019s once-placid suburbs early in the war, or the\nwholesale destruction and mass death in still-captive cities such as Mariupol,\nin the country\u2019s southeast.\n\nWorld & Nation\n\n### Will the people of Bucha, Ukraine, find justice?\n\nRussian atrocities number in the tens of thousands, Ukraine says. The ICC\nwants to arrest Putin. But what are the prospects for justice?\n\nMarch 17, 2023\n\nAfter months of military setbacks, however, many here wonder whether the long\nfront lines that arc across Ukraine\u2019s south and east can hold, or even whether\nRussian troops could seize a major city.\n\nWithout a rapid infusion of aid, \u201cit will be much harder for us to fight,\u201d\nsaid Andriy Borovyk, 38, who was having a coffee outdoors with a friend in the\ncity center. \u201cI think we could lose some territories, definitely.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike many others here, he likened the attitude of some of Ukraine\u2019s allies to\nthat of European leaders before World War II, as Adolf Hitler was coming to\npower.\n\n\u201cI think that Westerners are in a warm bath, as we say in Ukraine \u2014 like in\n1939, they think it will never affect them,\u201d said Borovyk, who works for an\nanti-corruption nongovernmental organization. \u201cBut it will. History has a\ncycle.\u201d\n\nWorld & Nation\n\n### In war-torn Ukraine, a woman searches for her husband. Will she find him?\n\nIn a Ukrainian village, a woman wants only one thing: to find her husband, who\ndisappeared shortly after Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine started two years ago.\n\nFeb. 24, 2024\n\nA metropolis the size of Chicago, Kyiv bears the earmarks of any sophisticated\nEuropean capital: stately architecture, craft breweries, ubiquitous electric\nscooters, colorful springtime blooms in spacious, well-tended parks. But\nbeneath the bustle runs an undercurrent of dread.\n\nAlthough Kyiv lies hundreds of miles from the battle zone, war\u2019s hallmarks are\nin plain view: a sea of fluttering blue-and-yellow flags commemorating fallen\nsoldiers, QR codes plastered on posters for crowdfunding efforts to buy drones\nor other supplies for field units, men and women in camouflage uniforms\nkissing loved ones goodbye at train stations.\n\nWorld & Nation\n\n### Sleepless in Kyiv: In Ukraine\u2019s capital, the stress of war weighs on\neveryone. How do people cope?\n\nHow do citizens of Kyiv cope with the sleep deprivation and stress from\nRussia\u2019s war on Ukraine? Some push it down, some try yoga or dancing.\n\nJuly 5, 2023\n\nEven an open-air display of wrecked, rusting Russian military vehicles \u2014\ninstalled early in the war as a morale booster in a square outside a landmark\nKyiv monastery \u2014 is more likely these days to inspire a frisson of foreboding\nthan a spurt of national pride.\n\nPeople view captured Russian equipment, including tanks, in front of St.\nMichael\u2019s monastery in Kyiv, Ukraine.\n\n(Pete Kiehart / For The Times)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA sea of flags, each representing a fallen Ukrainian soldier, is displayed on\nIndependence Square in Kyiv.\n\n(Pete Kiehart / For The Times)\n\nIn the war\u2019s heady early months, after Russian forces menaced Kyiv but then\nwere forced to pull back, people flocked to the square to take selfies, and\nchildren played tag between the hulking wrecks. The display has been a\nfrequent backdrop for visiting foreign dignitaries, including President Biden,\nwho strolled the square last year.\n\nFor Marina Kozulina, a 50-something Kyiv woman walking her little black dog\nnear a half-ruined tank, the military detritus in the square has become more a\nreminder of peril than triumph.\n\nPolitics\n\n### Biden makes surprise Ukraine visit, pledging more U.S. aid as war\u2019s\nanniversary nears\n\nEven as air-raid sirens wailed, Biden met with Ukraine\u2019s leader to pledge\ncontinued U.S. support, both moral and material, for Kyiv against Russia.\n\nFeb. 20, 2023\n\n\u201cSeeing this makes me nervous, to think about how close the Russians were to\nKyiv, and if they could be again,\u201d she said. \u201cI want us to win, but it\u2019s very\ndifficult.\u201d\n\nEven President Volodymyr Zelensky, the former comedian who has tirelessly\nrallied compatriots since the invasion of Feb. 24, 2022, is taking an\nincreasingly grim tone as cities across the country are pummeled nightly by\nrelentless Russian drone and missile attacks.\n\n\u201cIt is quite obvious that our existing air defense capabilities in Ukraine are\nnot sufficient,\u201d he said in a recent nightly address. \u201cAnd it is obvious to\nour partners.\u201d\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky inspects the fortification lines in the\nKharkiv region on April 9, 2024.\n\n(Ukrainian Presidential Press Office )\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore gloomy news from the battle zone came Saturday, as the head of Ukraine\u2019s\nmilitary warned that conditions in the country\u2019s east had \u201csignificantly\nworsened\u201d in recent days.\n\nWriting on the messaging app Telegram, the military chief, Gen. Oleksandr\nSyrskyi, said warmer spring temperatures were drying up previously muddy\nterrain, allowing Russian forces to step up their assaults with tanks and\nother armored vehicles.\n\nUntil recently, explicit talk of potential military defeat was considered\nlargely out of bounds for Ukrainian officials, because they did not want to\nappear to be seeking expensive Western backing to wage what could ultimately\nprove a fruitless struggle.\n\nBut Zelensky did not mince words in a video meeting last weekend with a\nUkrainian aid group: \u201cIt is necessary to specifically tell Congress that if\nCongress does not help Ukraine, Ukraine will lose the war,\u201d he said.\n\nMany Ukrainians have an extremely detailed grasp of U.S. election-year\npolitics, and any visiting American is asked again and again: When is more\nhelp coming?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re grateful \u2014 more than grateful,\u201d said Anastasia Shevchuk, 16, who was\nout shopping downtown with friends. \u201cBut everyone understands that if Russia\nwins here, it\u2019s a big, big threat to all of Europe, and the rest of the world\nas well.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorld & Nation\n\n### Ukrainians are grateful for U.S. military aid. But some ask whether they\ndeserve thanks too\n\nEven some of Kyiv\u2019s close allies have grumbled that it doesn\u2019t seem\nsufficiently grateful for the aid it\u2019s received. How thankful is thankful\nenough?\n\nSept. 21, 2023\n\nAttention here is heavily focused on the $60-billion U.S. aid package that has\nbeen blocked for months by congressional Republicans. It may yet be put to a\nvote this month, but is still in danger of being derailed by internecine\nfighting in the GOP.\n\n\u201cVoting on this aid, it\u2019s a matter of life and death \u2014 we depend on our\npartners, especially the U.S.,\u201d said Bohdan Krylyvenko, 38, sitting in the\nsunshine outside a fast-food restaurant. \u201cYou might think, \u2018Oh, McDonald\u2019s is\nopen, everything looks OK. But it\u2019s totally not OK.\u201d\n\nAcross the country, near-nightly Russian attacks exact a growing toll. The\nUnited Nations\u2019 human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine said this week that\nat least 604 Ukrainian civilians were killed or injured in such strikes \u2014\nhitting apartment blocks and shops, churches and cultural sites \u2014 in March.\n\n\u201cThe situation in Ukraine is dire; there is not a moment to lose,\u201d the U.S.\nambassador to Ukraine, Bridget Brink, wrote Thursday on the social media\nplatform X. She noted the latest predawn air alert at 4:15 a.m., as missile\nbarrages struck several parts of the country.\n\nIn a conflict marked by dramatic ups and downs over the last two years \u2014\ninitial fears that Ukraine would be swiftly subdued, an inspirational underdog\nnarrative as the country successfully defended itself, stunning Ukrainian\ncounteroffensives in the country\u2019s south and east in 2022 \u2014 recent months, by\ncontrast, have brought a drumbeat of bad news.\n\nLast year\u2019s much-vaunted summer counteroffensive foundered amid muted but\npointed mutual recrimination between Ukrainian officials and American backers\nover battle tactics. The eastern town of Avdiivka fell to Russian forces in\nFebruary, the first such Ukrainian loss in nine months, a defeat perhaps even\nmore stinging symbolically than tactically.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn apartment in a nine-story building damaged by Russian shelling on April 9,\n2024, in Selydove, in eastern Ukraine.\n\n(Oleksandr Buriak / Getty Images)\n\nManpower shortages in the ranks of a professional army bolstered at the war\u2019s\noutbreak by citizen soldiers \u2014 teachers, accountants and mechanics who rushed\nto volunteer \u2014 have forced an unpopular measure to lower the military\nmobilization age from 27 to 25. And in the battle zone, artillery stocks have\ndwindled alarmingly, the senior U.S. commander in Europe warned Congress on\nWednesday.\n\nWorld & Nation\n\n### After an artist\u2019s studio was damaged in a Russian missile strike, he found\na new medium: war debris\n\nThis Ukrainian artist was known for whimsical sculptures. Now, amid Russia\u2019s\nwar on Ukraine, he creates art from war debris, military weapons and fury.\n\nAug. 17, 2023\n\nTestifying before the House Armed Services Committee, Army Gen. Christopher\nCavoli said that within weeks, Ukrainian forces will be vastly outgunned if\nmore armaments are not rushed in.\n\n\u201cThey are now being outshot by the Russian side 5-1,\u201d Cavoli said of Ukrainian\ntroops. \u201cThe Russians fire five times as many artillery shells at the\nUkrainians than the Ukrainians are able to fire back. That will immediately go\nto 10-1 in a matter of weeks.\u201d\n\nThe general added: \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about months. We\u2019re not talking\nhypothetically.\u201d\n\nThe Ukrainian side can claim successes as well, some of which its leaders\nbelieve have gone unfairly unheralded. Those include stepped-up domestic\nproduction of much-needed drones, and securing a shipping lane for grain\nexports as Ukraine \u2014 a country without a formal navy \u2014 has sunk or disabled\none-third of all Russian warships in the Black Sea with missile and drone\nattacks.\n\nUkraine has also harried Moscow with strikes aimed mainly at Russian energy\ninstallations \u2014 mirroring, though at a far smaller scale, the destructive\nRussian attacks aimed at Ukraine\u2019s power grid. But some Ukrainian officials\nhave grumbled that they are not allowed to use Western-supplied weaponry\nbeyond the country\u2019s borders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMilitary analysts say the drop-off in aid not only contributes to battlefield\nhardship now, but also makes it difficult for Ukraine to make plans to try to\nrecapture military momentum.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dual challenge \u2014 to stabilize the current front line, and put in place\nsignificant defenses so the Russian advances this year are blunted,\u201d said\nMatthew Savill, the director of military sciences at the Royal United Services\nInstitute, a British defense and security think tank.\n\nBecause of the immediate and short-term difficulties, a major Ukrainian\ncounteroffensive this year is a near-impossibility, he said.\n\nIn the meantime, European allies are seeking to break the U.S. congressional\nlogjam. On Tuesday, British Foreign Secretary David Cameron met with Secretary\nof State Antony J. Blinken, describing the blocked assistance as not only\npivotal for Ukraine, but also \u201cprofoundly in your interest\u201d \u2014 that of the\nUnited States.\n\nIn a telling bit of realpolitik, however, the British foreign secretary also\nmade the trek to Florida for a meeting with former President Trump, who, as he\nseeks a second term, has played a key role in dissuading his congressional\nallies from endorsing the aid. After the meeting, Cameron made no claim of\nprogress.\n\nWorld & Nation\n\n### In Ukraine, a harvest of death as bodies of the fallen are returned to\ntheir hometowns\n\nEven far from Ukraine\u2019s front lines, military funerals set off waves of\nmourning. \u2018You can\u2019t see an end to it,\u2019 one chaplain says as the war drags on.\n\nJune 26, 2023\n\nIn every corner of Ukraine, the fallen return home daily.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Kyiv this week, two wooden caskets bearing soldiers\u2019 bodies were brought to\nIndependence Square \u2014 the heart of Ukraine\u2019s 2014 pro-democracy protests \u2014 in\na solemn parade, with mourners kneeling at their passing.\n\nPeople pay their respects to two Ukrainian servicemen killed in a battle with\nRussian troops during the funeral ceremony in Independence Square in Kyiv on\nApril 9, 2024.\n\n(Efrem Lukatsky / Associated Press)\n\nLooking on was a 36-year-old lieutenant colonel named Bohdan, a friend of one\nof the dead soldiers. He described his feelings when his own 2-year-old son,\nno stranger to air alerts, asked him when the missiles would come again.\n\n\u201cWhen he grows up, I don\u2019t want him to have to fight this kind of war, but\nwithout the world\u2019s help, maybe he will have to,\u201d said the officer, who, in\nkeeping with military policy, did not want his full name used.\n\nHe watched bleakly as the coffins were carried to the foot of a towering\nmonument to Ukraine\u2019s 1991 independence.\n\n\u201cMany people, the best people of our nation, will die,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut we\nwill fight.
