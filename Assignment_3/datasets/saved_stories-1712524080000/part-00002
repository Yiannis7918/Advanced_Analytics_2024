And here is an overview of the Greaseweazle models.\n\nGreaseweazle F7 Lightning PlusGreaseweazle V4\n\nA short note for the DOS and CP/M community: You can save/duplicate any DOS or\nCP/M disk with the Greaseweazle, but the so-called image or LUX files occupies\n10 to 20 MByte storage on your hard disk and this for each image!\n\nThe advantage of the Greaseweazle workflow is that you can use modern\nequipment and information technology and only need some old disk drives. It is\nmuch easier to keep running a few NOS floppy disk drives (8\", 1.2M, 360K,\n1.44M, 720K) than a whole DOS system.\n\n### Versions\n\nUntil the end of 2022, I always used GW version 0.28 for both F7 and V4.\nEverything ran fine, so I had no reason to look for updates. But in January\n2023 I realized that there is already version 1.5.\n\n## Test Station\n\ntop\n\n### New Version (since 01/2023)\n\nAll three drives are housed in a modern drive enclosure with its own power\nsupply. The connection to the respective FLUX adapter is made with the so-\ncalled Shugart-BUS also called daisy chaining. In other words, the cable has\nno cable twister. Access is via the DRIVE SELECT selection, which is set on\nthe respective drive. This also means that all three drives always rotate when\naccessed, because there is no separate MOTOR ON signal.\n\n  * DS1 or DS0\n    * Panasonic JU474-5 ........DS/HD, 360 rpm, 80 tracks, 96 tpi\n  * DS2 or DS1\n    * Teac FD-235 .............

Simply copy or install the current software and connect the Greaseweazle\nto the USB port. The installation will take no more than 2 minutes.\n\n> And this is unfortunately a disadvantage of the Kryoflux. It absolutely\n> needs its own Windows USB driver. After using the Greaseweazle and the\n> FLUXTEEN, which use/install the original Windows driver, I can no longer\n> work with the Kryoflux. This problem can be solved by a new installation,\n> but it requires some knowledge and is a bit tedious. For this reason I use\n> Kryoflux with macOS; works fine.\n\n### GUI\n\nFurthermore, you have the option to choose between two Windows GUIs if the\ncommand line version of GW.EXE is too inconvenient for you.\n\nI have both installed, but I like \"FluxMyFluffyFloppy by Frank Bopple\" a\nlittle better. In this GUI, you can easily create various templates and thus\nwork very flexibly and quickly.\n\n### Drive Select\n\nIn connection with the FLUXTEEN, which can only handle DAISY CHAINING, I\nnoticed that the Greaseweazle (GW) can handle both the crossed IBM floppy\ncable with twist (drive A: and B:) and the DAISY CHAIN cable (drive 0, 1 or\n2).\n\nYou can control this in GW with the command line parameter \"--drive=A or B or\n0 or 1 or 2\". With other words, you can use three different drives in GW.\n\nThe Kryoflux (KF) on the opposite can only handle two drives and uses the\nmodern IBM PC cable/jumper scheme with the twist. Here you jumper both drives\nas DS1, both as the 2nd drive. Connect drive B before and drive A after the\ntwist.\n\n## Information\n\ntop\n\n  * Keir Fraser: Github\n  * The Software Preservation Society: SPS\n\n  * Home\n  * Top\n  * Acronyms\n  * Literature\n  * Links\n  * Impressum\n  * Datenschutz\n\n\u00a9 2023 Thomas Brase\n\n", "frontpage": true}
