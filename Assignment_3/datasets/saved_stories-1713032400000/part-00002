By some accounts, it was the worst traffic jam ever observed.\n\nNotwithstanding extreme cases like China\u2019s, there is no historical record of\ntraffic jams. Like a rainy day, a traffic jam is an unexceptional event:\nstatistical noise without a unifying narrative, a cascading slowdown that\nmakes the inciting disruption irrelevant as it engulfs more and more cars.\nTraffic congestion is not a catastrophe but business as usual, often quite\npredictable, rising and falling on daily cycles like tides. And while a\ntraffic jam\u2019s aggregate cost is quantifiable, in dollars or wasted hours, the\npain it inflicts is ultimately personal, experienced as quotidian and\narbitrary tedium by thousands of individual drivers. Nothing is less\ninteresting than someone else\u2019s traffic jam story.\n\n### Traffic Jams as Protocol Friction\n\nLocal news media report on traffic in a manner that resembles their weather\ncoverage, as though it\u2019s a natural feature to plan one\u2019s day around and beyond\nthe scope of anyone\u2019s control (which it is). A phenomenon like traffic\ncongestion, having settled into its cyclical equilibrium, eventually congeals\ninto a permanent feature of the built environment, and the traffic-laden\nroadway is thus a microcosm of the urban landscape as a whole: a layered\nmatrix of material infrastructure (buildings, roads, fiber-optic cables)\nsupporting additional strata of flows (people, money, information), with each\nlayer possessing a different degree of flexibility.\n\nLike traffic itself, the jam is a recognizable pattern that emerges from the\ninteraction of these layers: human behavior, physical infrastructure, laws,\nand a variety of other forces. However slowly it moves, this congestion is not\na static object but a flow, a temporal mismatch between the supply of road\ncapacity and the demand for it. At first glance, traffic jams appear to be a\ncoordination failure\u2014not quite anyone\u2019s fault, but rather the emergent product\nof a self-organizing system. When understood as individual sacrifice in the\ninterest of collective mobility, however, traffic jams begin to blur the\ndistinction between failure and success: by broadening or narrowing one\u2019s\nperspective, either assessment is possible.\n\nTraffic congestion is a representative problem of the contemporary Western\ncity: a chronic tension between the built environment\u2019s hard constraints and\nthe fluid, volatile demand for that infrastructure and its various uses\u2014a\nconflict that, in its worst cases, reverses the utility of a system altogether\n(like a municipal sewer system overflowing during a storm). Better\ncoordination mechanisms could presumably help, but the tradeoffs necessary for\nsuch optimization are often undesirable, entailing higher costs or restricted\nfreedom. As growing vehicular flow approaches the limit of a road\u2019s maximum\nthroughput, a traffic jam becomes the most likely resolution, like a packet-\nswitched network suffering from bufferbloat2 and jitter3\u2014an analogy that\nhighlights how cars and drivers are more like a highway\u2019s informational\ncontent than individuals with agency, at least while on the road. Such\noutcomes, in their apparent disorder, may seem to indicate the absence of\nprotocols. But they are more likely just symptoms of flawed protocols, or\nnecessary headaches meted out by protocols working as intended.\n\nTraffic jams are a problem that is not meant to be solved but managed\u2014one\npossible approach to the challenge of distributing aggregate benefits and\ncosts among individuals. The jam is a feature of traffic, not a bug\u2014less a\nfailure than the janky avoidance of failure, a necessary compromise, the\nsufficient but \u201cdumb\u201d management of high throughput. What is traffic, after\nall, but a multitude of cars on the road, each driver pursuing their own self-\ninterest, using transportation infrastructure for its intended purpose? You\naren\u2019t stuck in traffic. You are traffic.\n\n### Cities and Their Problems\n\nAs nodes of concentrated human activity, cities are inherently sites of\nconflict, as well as systems for resolving that conflict. If civilization is\nincreasingly urbanized, so are its problems. Many of the contemporary city\u2019s\nseemingly disparate troubles, including traffic congestion, are unified by an\nunderlying condition: a mismatch between the built environment and the\ncollective needs of its inhabitants, between physical systems and information\nflows, between material structures and the ever-changing uses to which they\nare put.\n\nIn the United States and elsewhere, city dwellers grapple with this mismatch\nin a variety of ways: widespread, often imprecise complaints about\ngentrification, along with an increasingly polarized debate about the proper\nsolution to declining residential affordability, attest to a dissatisfaction\nwith how access to the built environment is distributed. Other urban areas,\nmeanwhile, face economic decline and population loss, a phenomenon epitomized\nby the deindustrializing American Rust Belt in the late 20th century. The more\nrecent explosion of remote work has led to a persistent underutilization of\ncentral city office space that seems poised to echo that previous phase of\nurban deindustrialization. Globally scaled problems like climate change and\nthe COVID-19 pandemic have threatened the perceived viability of specific\ncities, or of cities in general, while exposing flaws in how those cities are\norganized. Chronic issues like traffic congestion endure. In all of these\ncases, the cumbersome base layers of the built environment can\u2019t keep up with\ncircumstances that seem to change faster and faster\u2014and in their rigid\nmateriality, how could they?\n\nMore fundamentally, there is a prevailing sentiment among individuals that the\ncity they want is unattainable\u2014that they lack the agency to shape the built\nenvironment they inhabit, with real estate market conditions, digital\nplatforms, corporate interests, vast infrastructure networks, and inexorable\nclimate volatility superseding more local or individual control of housing,\npublic space, commerce, and other urban systems. This misalignment fuels a\ndesire for a more authentic, participatory urbanism: walkable cities, third\nplaces,4 local community, a flourishing small business ecosystem, and a\ngeneral reclamation of agency in an atomized, consumerized city.\n\nNot only is the built environment temporally mismatched to collective needs,\nit is spatially mismatched: the mechanisms for effecting change at local and\nindividual scales are deficient, exacerbating both categories of misalignment.\nTraffic exhibits this quality too, as a large-scale system that negatively\nimpacts specific neighborhoods or commercial districts while subsuming or\noverwhelming individual action. As these global forces exert a growing\ninfluence over local activities, there is a dearth of agency at more local\nscales: the individual, the household, the block, the neighborhood, and even\nthe city itself.\n\nThe urban environment, again, is a layered system. In his 1994 book How\nBuildings Learn, Stewart Brand quotes architect Frank Duffy\u2019s assertion that a\nbuilding is not a building per se, but \u201cseveral layers of longevity of built\ncomponents.\u201d5 These \u201cpace layers\u201d range from the more rigid\u2014the building\u2019s\nsite and structure\u2014to the more fluid and adaptable\u2014the interior layout,\nfurniture, and decorative elements. Beyond its practical insight, Brand\u2019s\nframing offers a broader understanding of how systems evolve over time and how\nhumans live with those systems. Organizational agency, he notes, often\ncorresponds to the pace layers, with faster-changing layers subject to more\nindividual control (a homeowner or tenant) and slower-changing layers\nstewarded by the community or state.\n\nFrom Stuart Brand, How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They\u2019re Built,\nchapter 2, \u201cShearing Layers\u201d (New York: Viking Penguin, 1994)\n\nPerhaps most importantly, Brand observes, the dynamics of a building, city, or\nany system \u201cwill be dominated by the slow components, with the rapid\ncomponents simply following along.\u201d6\n\nThis is both a blessing and a curse: the slow layers provide continuity,\nconstraint, and stability, while the quicker layers are sources of innovation\nand dynamism. \u201cBut if we let our buildings come to a full stop, they stop\nus.\u201d7 The tension or \u201cshearing\u201d between the built environment\u2019s various layers\nas they change at different rates is an unavoidable condition, but Brand notes\nthat an adaptive system allows for \u201cslippage\u201d between those layers:\n\nOtherwise the slow systems block the flow of the quick ones, and the quick\nones tear up the slow ones with their constant change.8\n\nWhen the base layers of the urban landscape, being both slow and expensive to\nmodify, are unable to adapt and change as quickly as we\u2019d like them to\u2014when\nthe hardware can\u2019t keep up with the software that runs on it (sometimes\nliterally)\u2014then, in the meantime, we can turn our attention from its more\nrigid base layers to the more flexible and adaptable upper layers\u2014the parts of\nthe built environment that aren\u2019t nailed down, so to speak, and the social,\ncommercial, and informational layers on top of it all.\n\nThose malleable upper layers, as Brand observed, are also more responsive to\nlocal and individual influence. It is easier to reorganize the furniture in\none\u2019s house than to change the building\u2019s structure or expand the site on\nwhich it\u2019s built. Longer-term interventions in the built environment that\nadapt the base layers to new conditions are still worthwhile\u2014they are as\ncritical as ever\u2014but, for individuals working at smaller spatial and temporal\nscales, the \u201csoftware\u201d (and the protocols that mediate it) may be a more\nfruitful domain of intervention than the hardware.\n\nThe traffic jam, again, exemplifies this dynamic, and foreshadowed the broader\nproblem when it first emerged in the 20th century: a coordination challenge\nbounded by physical infrastructure constraints that make subpar performance\nseem inevitable\u2014quick systems blocked by slow systems, with insufficient\nslippage between them (in contrast to the infrastructure for a transportation\nmode like the bicycle). Aside from limited solutions like tolls, congestion\npricing, and HOV lanes, highway traffic protocols amount to a faux-democratic\nnon-decision about how a multitude of overlapping vehicular trips should be\norganized and prioritized, with little regard for alternative paradigms that\nmight reflect different goals or priorities. (Notably, mobile apps like Waze\nand Google Maps have emerged as an ad hoc coordination layer for traffic,\nalthough they have not changed the underlying paradigm.) Despite the looming\nprospect of self-driving cars finally rationalizing traffic, most drivers do\nnot expect congestion to go away; our acceptance of the traffic jam is a kind\nof infrastructural fatalism.\n\nThe allocation challenges afflicting many other urban systems, such as housing\nand public space, are versions of the traffic jam. Like traffic jams, they\nhave become so familiar and so persistent that they seem less like problems\nthan like a sort of weather\u2014abiding circumstances we should just learn to live\nwith.\n\n### How Protocols Work\n\nTo claim that the built environment is full of infrastructurally constrained\ncoordination problems is another way of saying that cities have protocol\nproblems. If protocols are coordination mechanisms supported by\ninfrastructure, then cities are dense clusters of overlapping\nprotocols\u2014organizing processes that channel or filter physically grounded\nbehavior in the pursuit of some overarching goal, such as traffic flow, public\nspace usage, or the allocation of housing. In his 1996 paean to the urban\nstreet grid, Ladders, Albert Pope argues that the widespread expansion of the\ngrid in the 19th century \u201creconceived the city as an active process rather\nthan a discrete urban plan.\u201d9 As this has become even more true in the time\nsince, the role of protocols in the built environment has grown accordingly.\n\nAs with computers, the protocols of the built environment form a supple middle\nlayer between hardware and software, binding the two together by engaging with\nthe specific characteristics of each. Building codes and zoning laws, for\nexample, address both the physical forms of the structures they regulate as\nwell as their uses and externalities.\n\nBroadly, protocols can be understood as infrastructure plus behavior (this\noversimplifies the concept somewhat but will suffice for now). While protocols\noften depend upon their supporting infrastructure, they are also separate from\nit. At the end of Don DeLillo\u2019s novel White Noise, the protagonist\u2019s 6-year-\nold son rides his tricycle down an embankment and across the busy multi-lane\nexpressway near their home, narrowly avoiding a catastrophic accident:\n\nThe drivers could not quite comprehend. In their knotted posture, belted in,\nthey knew this picture did not belong to the hurtling consciousness of the\nhighway, the broad-ribboned modernist stream.10\n\nIt is thus possible to occupy infrastructure without participating in its\ncorresponding protocols. Traffic protocols are not the road itself, nor are\nthey the drivers, but a layer that mediates the interaction between those\ndomains\u2014a set of rules, norms, incentives, and design affordances that work\ntogether to translate a potentially chaotic range of behavior into a more\norderly result. To perhaps state the obvious, not every immaterial process or\nset of rules is a protocol. Additionally, not every protocol works well. There\nare certain characteristics that all protocols share, along with a larger set\nof criteria, such as legibility, that characterize good protocols.\n\nProtocols are essential to cities. The physical concentration of thousands or\nmillions of people and the intersection points of myriad local and global\nsystems, all competing to use the same finite space, are places of constant\ncompromise at every scale, full of externalities that must be managed,\nboundaries that must be negotiated, and conflicts that must be resolved. From\nthe individual lot to the block to the neighborhood and on up, cities contain\nsites of potential chaos that only maintain stability via the delicate\nbalancing act that protocols perform, constraining individual agency along\ncertain dimensions in order to extend it along others (but always within\nlimits).\n\nA local street in a dense urban core, for example, must accommodate traffic\ncirculation, pedestrian movement, commercial activity, the interface between\npublic and private residential space, and the wide range of additional\nactivities that happen in the urban public realm. These various systems are\noften at odds, sharing physical space by necessity. Pedestrians cross the\nstreet orthogonally to the flow of cars while delivery vehicles find it\nexpedient to park in bike lanes, risking a traffic citation that may be\ninconsistently enforced. Construction and maintenance work disrupt routine\nactivities in exchange for longer-term benefits, which do not always accrue to\nthe same parties who suffer its inconvenience. Protocols help to manage these\ninevitable conflicts: shared street usage depends upon a mixture of behavioral\npatterns and laws, such as pedestrians\u2019 right of way in crosswalks, along with\nphysical design elements like street signs, traffic lanes, and curbs. In many\nplaces, jaywalking is prohibited by laws that are largely unenforced, giving\nindividuals discretion to decide when such crossings are safe or appropriate.\n\nDefining what a city actually is, and what purpose cities ultimately serve,\naffirms the importance of protocols: a city is a place of concentrated\nexchange and interaction\u2014an active process, as Pope describes it. Urban\ntheorist Michael Batty writes that the city\u2019s essential feature is\n\u201cinteractions between different individuals rooted in time and space.\u201d11\nCities are where we meet to exchange money, goods, ideas, and above all,\ninformation. This implies a physical clustering of people\u2014the people who are\ndoing the interacting and exchanging, in the forms of commerce, cultural\nproduction, and social activity\u2014and while cities are sites of concentrated\npopulation, that is secondary to their status as sites of concentrated\ninteraction. A city is an information system, a conduit of flow. As\narchitecture historian Kazys Varnelis argues, a city is a communication\nsystem, inextricable from the network infrastructure that supports it.12\n(Suburbs and other settlement patterns that are not commonly understood as\n\u201ccities\u201d also enable interaction, but less densely.)\n\nViewed another way, protocols are the immaterial apparatus that support and\ndirect the physically grounded information flows that are concentrated in\ncities and transmitted by urban infrastructure. In her 2014 book\nExtrastatecraft, Keller Easterling describes the contemporary built\nenvironment as being increasingly structured by \u201cinfrastructure space,\u201d an\noperating system or medium of information that governs the physical realm:\n\nThe information resides in invisible, powerful activities that determine how\nobjects and content are organized and circulated.13\n\nThose \u201cinvisible, powerful activities\u201d are often protocols. And despite their\nimmateriality, protocols imprint themselves on the physical landscape itself,\nproducing observable patterns that both express the protocols\u2019 nature and\nshape their ongoing performance, in a feedback loop. The design of parks and\npublic squares, for example, often codifies the informal protocols of public\nspace usage (a process documented in William H. Whyte\u2019s 1980 book The Social\nLife of Small Urban Spaces).\n\n### Cities as Protocols\n\nWhere flows of information, human behavior, and physical infrastructure meet,\nprotocols are often found. Not only do cities contain protocols within and\nbetween systems like traffic and public space, cities also are protocols\nthemselves. A city, at its essence, is a localized system for organizing and\nfocusing collective behavior toward coherent goals, like commerce or cultural\nproduction. And that is just what protocols facilitate. A more robust\ndefinition of protocols is this: a structured process that organizes\nparticipants\u2019 behavior in the interest of achieving a collective goal.\n\nAlfred North Whitehead said that \u201ccivilization advances by extending the\nnumber of operations we can perform without thinking about them.\u201d14 Protocols\nembody this process; understanding them this way supports the assertion that\ncities themselves are protocols, efficiently compressing civilizational\nknowledge and effort, thereby maximizing others\u2019 ability to make use of it. As\nLewis Mumford writes in The Culture of Cities:\n\nWhat the shepherd, the woodman, and the miner know, becomes transformed and\n\u201cetherealized\u201d through the city into durable elements in the human heritage .\n. . Within the city the essence of each type of soil and labor and economic\ngoal is concentrated: thus arise greater possibilities for interchange and for\nnew combinations not given in the isolation of their original habitats.15\n\nProtocolization is thus an essential quality of the urban built environment.\nCities extend the operations available to their inhabitants by \u201cdoing the\nthinking\u201d for them, enabling more sophisticated forms of interaction than\nwould be possible in rural isolation. Geographic hubs like Silicon Valley,\nHollywood, and Wall Street all illustrate the amplifying effects of urban\nclustering and the shared infrastructure that it creates, but those are only\nthe most visible examples of a phenomenon that every city dweller benefits\nfrom. The cognitive burden of city life is likely higher than that of rural\nlife, of course\u2014a density of choices accompanies the density of\ninteractions\u2014but cities\u2019 ability to amplify and extend one\u2019s actions means\nthat the benefits of that cognitive burden are higher still, encouraging more\nintensive usage of urban infrastructure.\n\nA protocolized landscape tends to be user-friendly relative to the\nunprotocolized alternative, at least along the dimensions that align with the\nprotocols\u2019 functionality (and at the expense of dimensions that do not).\nToday, many individuals inhabit a nearly continuous globalized ecosystem of\nprotocolized infrastructure, evoked by metaphors like the \u201ccloud\u201d\u2014in this\nmilieu, an iPhone and a credit card are enough to ensure seamless passage\nthrough cities around the world, with relatively uninterrupted access to an\narray of services like Uber and Airbnb that smooth over the differences\nbetween places.\n\nIn his 1965 essay \u201cThe Great Gizmo,\u201d Reyner Banham praised the potent role of\nthe gizmo or \u201cclip-on device\u201d in American culture, which he describes as \u201ca\nsmall self-contained unit of high performance in relation to its size and\ncost, whose function is to transform some undifferentiated set of\ncircumstances to a condition nearer human desires.\u201d16 Although Banham did not\ninvoke protocols, his essay implies a complementary relationship between\nprotocols and gizmos, with the protocols making gizmos more potent and\nversatile and gizmos making protocols more useful and usable. Smartphones and\ncars are both ubiquitous because of robust mobile network coverage and road\naccess; widespread usage of those devices, in turn, creates demand for further\nrefinement and utilization of the protocols and infrastructure that support\nthem.\n\nIf the city itself is a protocol, it is also a Russian doll that comprises\nmany more protocols, at every scale. That is, protocols are frequently nested\nwithin other protocols, in the built environment and everywhere else. The most\ncomplex instances of protocols, such as markets or religions or cities, are\nmade up of countless \u201csmaller\u201d protocols that coordinate narrower subsets of\nbehavior. An auction is a protocol within markets, for example, just as a bid\nis a protocol within auctions. Likewise, cities function as nodes within\nglobal networks, linked via air travel, real estate investment, and circuits\nof business conferences and trade shows. Within cities, protocols operate at\nthe most local and granular scales, organizing informal retail, parking,\ninteractions between neighbors, and the usage of public spaces ranging from\nparks to sidewalks.\n\nLike all protocols, those that mediate the built environment possess\nfunctionality but lack higher purpose. Every protocol seeks to produce some\noutcome via behavioral coordination, but that outcome may not be worthwhile,\nand may even be counterproductive in other domains. The protocol itself does\nnot know or care, although its existence implies support for its functional\nobjective simply by making the objective\u2019s achievement more likely. Traffic\nprotocols, in this framing, express an inherent affinity for movement by car,\nas they enable driving from one place to another without any perspective on\nthe value of a given journey or its particular details. While a protocol\u2019s\ndesign often reflects the extrinsic values system or higher purpose that\noriginally gave rise to it, the intrinsic operation of the protocol itself is\nindependent of those values, and frequently drifts further from them over\ntime.\n\nCities are no different: they concentrate human interaction and facilitate\nexchange without answering the question of why such coordination matters (to\nanswer that question with a purpose like economic growth or progress is to beg\nthe question). For this reason, protocols become problematic, or at least\nunhelpful, within systems that demand such value judgments. Those questions\nmust be answered outside the scope of the protocol itself. Trying to project\nhigher purpose onto protocols is a futile endeavor\u2014one that is all the more\ntempting when their design hints at the system of values that originated them.\n\n### Protocol Failure\n\nIf protocols lack any higher purpose, then protocol failure is difficult to\ndiagnose. What does it mean for a protocol to fail, and which subset of urban\nproblems can accurately be described as protocol failures?\n\nWhen a protocol fails, it does not fail according to external criteria, but\naccording to its own internal objectives. A cryptocurrency protocol that\nfosters illicit activity via the financial transactions it was built to\nenable, or a bureaucratic protocol that has become decoupled from any external\nusefulness but persists by inertia, have not failed by their own standards.\nNeither has a traffic jam, as discussed above: what matters\u2014what the protocol\ncares about\u2014is that cars and passengers reached their destinations, however\nsignificant or pointless their journeys. A traffic jam highlights the\npossibility of improved performance, but from the narrow perspective of\ntraffic itself, that congestion is not quite a failure\u2014rather, a driver\u2019s\ndecision to forego car travel altogether, for fear of traffic, would be the\ntrue failure. According to its own internal logic, a protocol succeeds to the\nextent that it is used.\n\nWithin a complex ecosystem like a city, this solipsistic quality of protocols\nmeans that they have externalities that must be managed\u2014often by other\nprotocols. A protocol that is nested within another protocol, after all, can\nstill fail with respect to the encompassing protocol\u2019s objectives while\nsucceeding according to its own. Within a more broadly defined protocol of\nregional mobility, then, a traffic jam can indeed be considered a failure, if\nthe narrow traffic protocol achieves a suboptimal solution by prioritizing\nexcessive driving at the expense of other modes like transit or biking.\nZooming out far enough, it becomes possible to question the purpose of the car\npassengers\u2019 trips themselves, and ask whether they should have just stayed\nhome. These questions, again, cannot be answered within the context of traffic\nitself.\n\nProtocol failure can be hard to identify for other reasons. Many of the best\nprotocols fulfill Whitehead\u2019s mandate so effectively that the problems they\nsolve disappear from view, only to reappear when something breaks. We mainly\nthink about how the power grid works when it becomes unreliable, for example.\nIn this sense, protocol failure offers a more complete view of a protocolized\nsystem, making the invisible visible. The average person\u2019s awareness of\nprotocols, in the built environment and elsewhere, likely suffers from adverse\nselection: the most visible protocols are the most dysfunctional ones.\n\nThere are positive and negative modes of protocol failure. The positive mode\ncreates a tangible problem\u2014garbage piling up on the street, traffic\ncongestion, rising housing costs, crime. The negative mode, however, consists\nof missed opportunity: the markets that weren\u2019t made, the transactions that\ndidn\u2019t occur, the value not created. The negative failure mode is more\ndifficult to observe or quantify, but is theoretically infinite. To put it\nanother way, there is always room for protocols to improve.\n\nProtocol failure is ultimately difficult to assess. For chronic urban issues\nlike traffic congestion and housing shortages, the appearance of failure often\nmasks a system working more or less as designed, but to the detriment of\ncertain participants. The protocol itself does not care, and failure has\ndifferent meanings at different scales and from different perspectives.\nEfforts to solve problems that involve protocols, however those problems are\ndefined, must first identify the contours of those protocols, and then\nunderstand whether the proper domain of intervention is the protocols\nthemselves or the context in which they operate.\n\n### The Urbanist\u2019s Dilemma\n\nThe field of urban planning, Thomas Campanella writes:\n\nhas been largely unsuccessful over the last half century at its own game:\nbringing about more just, sustainable, healthful, efficient and beautiful\ncities and regions.17\n\nThe contemporary urbanist is stifled by protocols, having failed to adequately\nrecognize or engage with them. \u201cArchitects and designers stick to the discrete\nand the designable,\u201d Albert Pope writes, \u201ceven as their efforts are undermined\nby forces far beyond their control.\u201d18 As recent history has shown, urbanists\u2019\nfailure to shape so much of the built environment does not mean that no one\nhas done so, just that other industries like real estate and tech have shaped\nit instead\u2014and they have shaped it according to their own objectives. As\ndiscussed above, the built environment is both temporally and spatially\nmismatched to the collective needs of those who inhabit and use it, and it is\ntempting to believe that this is an unresolvable conflict.\n\nUrbanism, as a practice and a point of view, is hampered by its core\ncompetency, a focus on the design of the physical environment. The discipline\nsuffers from a bias toward the visible and the tangible\u2014a bias toward built\nforms. To a hammer, after all, every problem is a nail. Pope continues:\n\nThis retreat to the logic of form is a transparent attempt to regain our\ntraditional prerogatives, our fixation on the known and the designable, to the\nneglect of the actual state of the contemporary urban environment.19\n\nWhile form does matter, it is no longer the primary lever of meaningful\nchange. The overall quality of urban and suburban life has become less\ncorrelated with the quality of its physical design and more dependent upon\nglobal information flows, market forces, and infrastructural affordances (the\ntwo are not mutually exclusive, of course, and many places enjoy both).\n\nAs Stewart Brand\u2019s model implies, the shearing that occurs between a system\u2019s\nslow and fast layers is a fundamental feature of built structures, whether\nindividual buildings or cities. To somehow eliminate this quality\u2014by forcing\nsolid structures to become flexible or freezing moveable parts in place\u2014would\nundermine many of those structures\u2019 advantages. Demand for various parts of\nthe built environment will always fluctuate, and the volatility of those\nfluctuations is likely to keep increasing. The true problem is not that this\nhappens, but rather the urbanist\u2019s ongoing failure to properly engage with it.\n\nIn his 2001 essay \u201cJunkspace,\u201d architect Rem Koolhaas offers an ambiguous and\nbackhanded tribute to a protocolized urbanism, which the rest of his piece\ngoes on to describe:\n\nWe have built more than did all previous generations put together, but somehow\nwe do not register on the same scales. We do not leave pyramids.20\n\nMuch to the dismay of traditionalists who hope to restore a fading vision of\nthe city, the protocolized built environment is not inherently monumental or\neven photogenic, and must be evaluated according to different criteria. Core\nurbanist values like walkability and density\u2014the values espoused by Jane\nJacobs and codified by the profession in the subsequent half century\u2014have been\nhistorically correlated with the centers of European and prewar American\ncities, which happen to be aesthetically legible and visually appealing\n(partially due to nostalgia). The failure of any competing urbanist paradigm\nto emerge in the intervening decades suggests a lack of imagination at best\nand an abdication of responsibility for the built environment at worst.\n\nToday, we no longer build pyramids, or cathedrals, or Venice (unless you count\nthe simulacra found in Las Vegas or Disney World). Protocols don\u2019t require\nmonuments and they don\u2019t generate them. This is not for lack of ability,\nobviously, but rather a shift in priorities as well as the processes that\ncreate the built environment. Today we build fulfillment centers, freeways,\ncontainer ships, and supertall skyscrapers, all accidental monuments to the\nvarious protocols that utilize them, and equally impressive (but usually more\nesoteric, largely appreciated by the \u201cprotocol literate\u201d). Unlike cathedrals\nand pyramids, the charismatic qualities of protocol monuments are likely to be\nincidental, a side effect of their primary purpose. Like computer hardware,\nthey are often not even meant to be seen\u2014only indirectly, through the output\nof their software.\n\nThe people who claim to still want literal or figurative cathedrals are rarely\nthe ones shaping the contemporary built environment. If they were, they would\nlikely realize they wanted something else instead. And when they do get their\ncathedrals, they come in the form of marketing content or superficial\ndecoration that disguises otherwise unassuming infrastructure space.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that much of \u201curbanism\u201d as we know it today is a kind of pyramid\nor cathedral\u2014a red herring that reflects our bias toward the concrete and the\nvisible at the expense of protocols, which already mold the built environment\nwhether we choose to acknowledge them or not. To bemoan the unflagging\nprevalence of suburbia and the junkspace that Koolhaas describes is to miss\nthe point: those arrangements have clear problems, yes, but urbanists should\ninquire why so much of the built environment has escaped their purview, only\nto get their attention later as an object of knee-jerk criticism. When human\nsettlement is successfully protocolized, it no longer must wait for anyone to\nplan it. The same is true of the massive informal settlements that have\nflourished on the margins of cities around the world: permissionless urbanism\nfor populations who can\u2019t access the official version.\n\nTraffic congestion is notorious for being a problem you cannot simply build\nyour way out of. Expanding highway capacity induces additional demand\nfollowing a period of temporary relief, ultimately settling at a new\nequilibrium that is as bad as the original congestion.21 Occasionally, new\nroad capacity even makes the problem worse.22 The intuitive explanation is\nthat drivers have a congestion tolerance and will increase the amount they\ndrive as long as that threshold is not exceeded, but more fundamentally,\ntraffic congestion is an inherent feature of traffic protocols.\n\nProtocol problems exhibit this quality more generally: although\ninfrastructure, broadly defined, is a prerequisite for protocols to work,\ninfrastructure is not enough to ensure that they do work. Protocols are\nsupported by infrastructure but also separate from it, such that changing the\ninfrastructure doesn\u2019t necessarily change the protocol. Like traffic, then, we\ncan\u2019t build our way out of protocol problems\u2014we need to tweak (or overhaul)\nthe protocols themselves. This is a more complex and uncertain endeavor than\nsimply building, which is perhaps why we avoid doing it, and why bad protocols\nbecome intractable and endemic: in many cases, they can only be fixed by\nstepping outside of the protocols themselves, and addressing the broader\ncontext in which those protocols operate. Traffic protocols, in other words,\nwill not solve the fundamental problem that traffic represents.\n\nIn a 1994 essay, \u201cWhat Ever Happened to Urbanism,\u201d -Rem Koolhaas articulates a\nvision for a protocolized approach to urbanism, in contrast to efforts that\nhad remained fixated on built forms, master planning, and traditional ideals:\n\nIf there is to be a \u201cnew urbanism\u201d it will not be based on the twin fantasies\nof order and omnipotence; it will be the staging of uncertainty; it will no\nlonger be concerned with the arrangement of more or less permanent objects but\nwith the irrigation of territories with potential; it will no longer aim for\nstable configurations but for the creation of enabling fields that accommodate\nprocesses that refuse to be crystallized into definitive form . . . it will no\nlonger be obsessed with the city but with the manipulation of infrastructure\nfor endless intensifications and diversifications, shortcuts and\nredistributions.23\n\nNearly thirty years later, the relevance of Koolhaas\u2019s words continues to\ngrow. Good protocols, more than comprehensive physical design, enable the\nstaging of uncertainty, the irrigation of territories with potential, and the\naccommodation of unanticipated opportunity (protocols and physical design can\ncomplement each other, of course). Protocol literacy\u2014for individuals, groups,\nand institutions\u2014is more than just a means of appreciating the monuments of\nthe contemporary built landscape. It is a path to efficacy.\n\n### The Grid: Toward a Protocolized Urbanism\n\nWikipedia\n\nTraffic congestion represents a particular kind of modern drudgery: the\nunpleasant second-order consequences of new technology, expressed in Frederik\nPohl\u2019s assertion:\n\na good science fiction story should be able to predict not the automobile but\nthe traffic jam.\n\nProtocols are often generative, catalyzing an array of unforeseen outcomes\nbeyond the specific problem they address. But those emergent outcomes aren\u2019t\nalways good. Flawed protocols like traffic create bad surprises.\n\nGood protocols, on the other hand, create good surprises\u2014hence Koolhaas\u2019s call\nto \u201cirrigate territories of potential.\u201d In the century before traffic became\nan everyday concern, another protocol, the urban street grid, emerged as an\nequally fundamental organizing principle of the modernizing built environment.\nAlbert Pope writes in Ladders:\n\nAs they were grafted onto historical urban cores, the 19th-century grid\nextensions did not so much represent planned entities, but the initiation of a\nsystem . . . that preempted the need for future episodes of planning.24\n\nPope makes a compelling case for the grid as a successful protocol\u2014generative,\nlegible, and flexible enough to accommodate the slippage between the built\nenvironment\u2019s temporal layers. In its apparent simplicity, the grid is\nimperfect but good enough, reproducible, extensible, and widely applicable,\nreconciling a range of urban activities and enabling a self-organizing,\nunplanned form of urbanization. Although the grid had ceased to be the default\narrangement of urban growth by the 20th century, Pope writes, its residual\npresence in cities serves as an ongoing reminder of its generativity:\n\nThe bond between gridded space and urban development is related to the grid\u2019s\ninherent ability to generate systems of infinite complexity. Its ubiquitous\npower comes from the manner in which it conceals this complexity beneath an\notherwise simplistic pattern of organization... It is not the simplicity of\nthe grid that accounts for this elaborate social topography; it is its\ndeference to complexity that supports the wide range of its adaptive\nheterogeneity\u2014to be the enabling apparatus of such an unlikely collection of\nthings and events.25\n\nIn a way, the grid\u2019s permissiveness as a spatial organizing system is the\nopposite of traffic\u2019s self-sorting autonomy. Traffic surprises us with hard\nconstraints; the grid surprises us with expansiveness and adaptability,\ndemarcating new territory for urban development well before any buildings or\npeople arrive. As a protocol, the grid is far from perfect, but it is both\nflexible and constrained in the right ways. Traffic is both flexible and\nconstrained in all the wrong ways.\n\nProtocols don\u2019t build pyramids. But the grid may be the closest thing we have\nto a protocol monument, so fundamental to our perception of cities that it is\nhidden in plain sight. Seemingly humble in its understated simplicity, the\ngrid is as audacious as it is visible and comprehensible, promising to extend\ninfinitely outward and map the world onto its coordinate system. Although the\ngrid itself no longer furnishes the guiding logic of urban expansion,\nurbanists would do well to learn its lessons and seek their own grid-like\nprotocols\u2014even if the autonomy those protocols enable threatens to make\ncentral planning unnecessary. At their worst, protocols create traffic jams.\nAt their best, they can be something more enchanting: as Pope writes, \u201cthe\nconcrete configuration that gives access to a greater, unknowable whole.\u201d26\n\nDrew Austin is a writer whose work explores the relationship between\ntechnology, culture, and cities. His newsletter, Kneeling Bus, investigates\nthe complicated relationship between physical and digital space, inquiring how\nthose spaces evolve together and how they interact. Drew is trained as an\nurban planner and has spent his career looking for ways to make transportation\nbetter, including the design of protocols like ridesharing.
