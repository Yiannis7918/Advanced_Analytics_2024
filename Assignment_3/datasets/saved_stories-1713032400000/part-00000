The\nmost power-hungry component of a phone is the display \u2014 so a decrease in the\nbrightness of a bunch of pixels can go a long way.^1\n\n## But what about the picture of my family?\n\nWell, that's an excellent point. People do like their family \u2014 sometimes they\nlike their family even more than they like prolonging their phone's battery\nlife.\n\nThis makes sense on the lock screen \u2014 where you can see almost an entire image\nof a family. However, on the home screen, the background image is usually\nobscured by app icons. This makes for a bad viewing experience \u2014 and even\nmakes it harder to make out app icons.\n\nLuckily on modern phones you can have it both ways \u2014 setting a different image\non your lock screen and your home screen.\n\n## How to change the home screen to a solid color on iOS\n\n  1. Press and hold the background of the lock screen. This will allow you to edit the lock screen and home screen.\n  2. Press Customise\n  3. Press Home Screen\n  4. Press Color\n  5. Select black or a dark color of your choice\n  6. Press Done\n\n### Footnotes\n\n  1. 1\n\nWhat is the impact of Dark Mode on battery drain?\n\nTags\n\n    \n\n  * resilience\n  * prolonging battery life\n  * saving energy\n  * device longevity\n  * telephone\n  * iOS\n\nPublished\n\n    8 Apr 2024\nUpdated\n\n    8 Apr 2024\n\nFound this useful?
