And he\u2019s still bad at finding his\nway around.\n\nThe world is full of people like Uttal \u2014 and their opposites, the folks who\nalways seem to know exactly where they are and how to get where they want to\ngo. Scientists sometimes measure navigational ability by asking someone to\npoint toward an out-of-sight location \u2014 or, more challenging, to imagine they\nare someplace else and point in the direction of a third location \u2014 and it\u2019s\nimmediately obvious that some people are better at it than others.\n\n\u201cPeople are never perfect, but they can be as accurate as single-digit degrees\noff, which is incredibly accurate,\u201d says Nora Newcombe, a cognitive\npsychologist at Temple University who coauthored a look at how navigational\nability develops in the 2022 Annual Review of Developmental Psychology. But\nothers, when asked to indicate the target\u2019s direction, seem to point at\nrandom. \u201cThey have literally no idea where it is.\u201d\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE\n\nSociety\n\n### Reading a Pacific navigator\u2019s mysterious map may require a shift in\nperspective\n\nPhysical World\n\n### GPS is going places\n\nLiving World\n\n### How animals follow their nose\n\nWhile it\u2019s easy to show that people differ in navigational ability, it has\nproved much harder for scientists to explain why. There\u2019s new excitement\nbrewing in the navigation research world, though. By leveraging technologies\nsuch as virtual reality and GPS tracking, scientists have been able to watch\nhundreds, sometimes even millions, of people trying to find their way through\ncomplex spaces, and to measure how well they do. Though there\u2019s still much to\nlearn, the research suggests that to some extent, navigation skills are shaped\nby upbringing.\n\n## Nurturing navigation skills\n\nThe importance of a person\u2019s environment is underscored by a recent look at\nthe role of genetics in navigation. In 2020, Margherita Malanchini, a\ndevelopmental psychologist at Queen Mary University of London, and her\ncolleagues compared the performance of more than 2,600 identical and\nnonidentical twins as they navigated through a virtual environment, to test\nwhether navigational ability runs in families. It does, they found \u2014 but only\nmodestly. Instead, the biggest contributor to people\u2019s performance was what\ngeneticists call the \u201cnonshared environment\u201d \u2014 that is, the unique experiences\neach person accumulates as their life unfolds. Good navigators, it appears,\nare mostly made, not born.\n\nA remarkable, large-scale experiment led by Hugo Spiers, a cognitive\nneuroscientist at University College London, gave researchers a glimpse at how\nexperience and other cultural factors might influence wayfinding skills.\nSpiers and his colleagues, in collaboration with the telecom company T-Mobile,\ndeveloped a game for cellphones and tablets, Sea Hero Quest, in which players\nnavigate by boat through a virtual environment to locate a series of\ncheckpoints. The game app asked participants to provide basic demographic\ndata, and nearly 4 million worldwide did so. (The app is no longer accepting\nnew participants except by invitation of researchers.)\n\nThrough the app, the researchers were able to measure wayfinding ability by\nthe total distance each player traveled to reach all the checkpoints. After\ncompleting some levels of the game, players also had to shoot a flare back\ntoward their point of origin \u2014 a dead-reckoning test analogous to the\npointing-to-out-of-sight-locations task. Then Spiers and his colleagues could\ncompare players\u2019 performance to the demographic data.\n\nSeveral cultural factors were associated with wayfinding skills, they found.\nPeople from Nordic countries tended to be slightly better navigators, perhaps\nbecause the sport of orienteering, which combines cross-country running and\nnavigation, is popular in those countries. Country folk did better, on\naverage, than people from cities. And among city-dwellers, those from cities\nwith more chaotic street networks such as those in the older parts of European\ncities did better than those from cities like Chicago, where the streets form\na regular grid, perhaps because residents of grid cities don\u2019t need to build\nsuch complex mental maps.\n\nOrienteering \u2013 a sport that combines cross-country running with map-based\nnavigation \u2013 is popular in Nordic countries. This may be one reason why people\nfrom those countries tend to be better navigators than people from elsewhere.\n\nCREDIT: BORDER LINERS ORIENTEERING CLUB / FLICKR\n\nResults like these suggest that an individual\u2019s life experience may be one of\nthe biggest determinants of how well they navigate. Indeed, experience may\neven underlie one of the most consistent findings \u2014 and clich\u00e9s \u2014 in\nnavigation: that men tend to perform better than women. Turns out this gender\ngap is more a question of culture and experience than of innate ability.\n\nNordic countries, for example, where gender equality is greatest, show almost\nno gender difference in navigation. In contrast, men far outperform women in\nplaces where women face cultural restrictions on exploring their environment\non their own, such as Middle Eastern countries.\n\nThis cultural aspect, and the importance of experience, are also supported by\nstudies of the Tsimane, a traditional Indigenous community in the Bolivian\nAmazon. Anthropologist Helen Elizabeth Davis of Arizona State University and\nher colleagues put GPS trackers on 305 Tsimane adults to measure their daily\nmovements over a three-day period, and found no difference in the distance\nmoved by men and women. Men and women also were equally adept at pointing to\nout-of-sight locations, they reported in Topics in Cognitive Science. Even\nchildren performed extremely well at this navigation task \u2014 a result, Davis\nthinks, of growing up in a culture that encourages children to range widely\nand explore the forest.\n\nMost cultures aren\u2019t like the Tsimane, though, and women and girls tend to be\nmore cautious about exploring, for good reasons of personal safety. Not only\ndo they gather less experience at navigating, but nervousness about security\nor getting lost also has a direct effect on navigation. \u201cAnxiety gets in the\nway of good navigation, so if you\u2019re worried about your personal safety,\nyou\u2019re a poor navigator,\u201d says Newcombe.\n\nThe Santa Barbara Sense of Direction Scale is widely used in navigation\nresearch. Studies suggest that people are fairly accurate at evaluating their\nown sense of direction.\n\nPersonality, too, appears to play a role in developing navigational ability.\n\u201cTo get good at navigating, you have to be willing to explore,\u201d says Uttal.\n\u201cSome people do not enjoy the experience of wandering, and others enjoy it\nvery much.\u201d\n\nIndeed, people who enjoy outdoor activities, such as hiking and biking, tend\nto have a better sense of direction, notes Mary Hegarty, a cognitive\npsychologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara. So do people who\nplay a lot of video games, many of which involve exploring virtual spaces.\n\nTo Uttal, this accumulating evidence suggests that inclination and early\nexperience nudge some people toward activities that involve navigation, while\nthose who are temperamentally less inclined to explore, who have less\nopportunity to wander or who have an initial bad experience may be less likely\nto engage in activities that require exploration. It all snowballs from there,\nUttal speculates. \u201cI think a combination of personality and ability pushes you\nin certain directions. It\u2019s a developmental cascade.\u201d\n\n## Mental mappers\n\nThat cascade presumably influences acquisition of the specific skills that are\nhallmarks of good navigators. These include the ability to estimate how far\nyou\u2019ve traveled, to read and remember maps (both printed and mental), to learn\nroutes based on a sequence of landmarks and to understand where points are\nrelative to one another.\n\nMuch of the research, though, has focused on two specific subskills: route-\nfollowing by using landmarks \u2014 for example, turn left at the gas station, then\ngo three blocks and turn right just past the red house \u2014 and what\u2019s often\ntermed \u201csurvey knowledge,\u201d the ability to build and consult a mental map of a\nplace.\n\nOf the two, route following is by far the easier task, and most people do\npretty well at it once they\u2019ve taken a route a few times, says Dan Montello, a\ngeographer and psychologist also at UC Santa Barbara. In a classic experiment\nfrom almost two decades ago, Montello\u2019s student Toru Ishikawa drove 24\nvolunteers, once a week for 10 weeks, on two twisting routes in a tony\nresidential area of Santa Barbara that they\u2019d never visited before.\n\nLater, almost every person could accurately state the order of landmarks along\neach route and roughly estimate the distance travelled between them. But they\nvaried widely in their ability to identify shortcuts between the two routes,\npoint to landmarks not visible from where they stood, or sketch a map of the\nroutes. Those who couldn\u2019t identify shortcuts or find landmarks may suffer\nfrom an inability to create accurate mental maps, the researchers think.\n\nVolunteers were driven repeatedly along two connected routes in an unfamiliar\nneighborhood and then asked to draw a map of the routes from memory. Their\nmaps differed widely in quality, as these examples show. Map 1 (top left),\nfrom an excellent navigator, matches the actual routes almost perfectly; map 4\n(bottom right), from a poor navigator, shows almost no correspondence to\nreality apart from the existence of two routes.\n\nResearch by Newcombe and her then graduate student Steven Weisberg underscores\nthe importance of such mental maps in navigation. They asked 294 volunteers to\nuse a mouse and computer screen to navigate along two routes through a virtual\ntown. Once the volunteers had learned the routes and the landmarks they\ncontained, the researchers asked them to stand at one landmark and point to\nothers on both routes.\n\nPeople fell into three classes, the researchers reported in 2018 in Current\nDirections in Psychological Science. Some people had formed a good mental map:\nThey could point accurately to landmarks on both the same and different\nroutes. Others had good route knowledge but struggled to create an integrated\nmap: They were good at pointing within a route, but poor between routes. A\nthird group was poor at all the pointing tasks.\n\nThat ability to build and refer to a mental map \u2014 a person\u2019s survey knowledge\n\u2014 goes a long way toward explaining why they\u2019re better navigators, Montello\nsays. \u201cWhen the only skill you have is the ability to think in terms of\nroutes, you can\u2019t be creative to get around barriers.\u201d Survey knowledge gives\nthe ability to navigate creatively, he says. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty stunning\ndifference.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, better navigators may also be better at switching modes and\nchoosing the most appropriate navigational strategy for the situation they\nfind themselves in, says cognitive neuroscientist Weisberg, now at the\nUniversity of Florida. This could mean using landmarks when they are obvious\nand mental maps when more sophisticated calculations are needed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve moved toward thinking that our better navigators are also using a lot of\nalternate strategies,\u201d Weisberg says. \u201cAnd they\u2019re doing so in a much more\nflexible way that affords different kinds of navigation, so that when they\nfind themselves in a new situation, they\u2019re better able to find their way.\u201d\n\nVolunteers followed two routes in a virtual-reality urban setting and then\nwere placed along one route and asked to point to out-of-sight landmarks on\nboth the same route and the other route. Based on their accuracy in pointing\n(measured by how many degrees off the correct direction they were; 90 degrees\nis chance performance), researchers divided the volunteers into three groups:\nPeople with good mental maps (green), who pointed accurately both within and\nbetween routes; people with good route knowledge (orange), who pointed\naccurately within a route but not between routes; and people who were bad at\nboth pointing tasks, indicating poor overall navigational ability (blue).\n\nWhen Weisberg moves around Gainesville where he lives now, for example, he\nkeeps track of north, because that works well in a city with a regular street\ngrid; when he goes home to the winding streets of Philadelphia, he relies more\non other cues to stay oriented.\n\nResearchers do not yet know whether every bad navigator is simply poor at\nsurvey knowledge, or whether some of the lost might be failing at other\nnavigational subskills instead, such as remembering landmarks or estimating\ndistance traveled. Either way, what can poor navigators do to improve? That\u2019s\nstill an open question. \u201cWe all have our pet theories,\u201d says Elizabeth\nChrastil, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of California, Irvine,\n\u201cbut they haven\u2019t reached the level of testing yet.\u201d\n\n## Pros and cons of GPS\n\nSimply practicing seems like it should work \u2014 and, indeed, it does in lab\nexperiments. \u201cWe can improve people\u2019s navigational abilities in virtual\nenvironments,\u201d says Arne Ekstrom, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University\nof Arizona. It takes about two weeks to show fairly dramatic gains \u2014 but it\u2019s\nnot yet clear whether people are really becoming better navigators or just\ngetting better at finding their way through the particular virtual\nenvironments used in the experiments.\n\nStay in the Know Sign up for the Knowable Magazine newsletter today\n\nSupport for the notion that people might improve with practice also comes from\nstudies of what happens when people stop using their navigation skills. In a\n2020 study published in Scientific Reports, for example, neuroscientists\nLouisa Dahmani and V\u00e9ronique Bohbot of McGill University in Montreal recruited\n50 young adults and questioned them about their lifetime experience of driving\nwith GPS. Then they tested the volunteers in a virtual world that required\nthem to navigate without GPS. The heaviest GPS users did worse, they found.\n\nA follow-up with 13 of the volunteers three years later revealed that those\nwho had used GPS the most during the intervening period experienced greater\ndeclines in their ability to navigate without GPS, strongly suggesting that\nGPS reliance causes diminished skills, rather than poor skills leading to\ngreater GPS use.\n\nExperts also suggest that struggling navigators like Uttal could try paying\ncloser attention to compass directions or prominent landmarks as a way to\nintegrate their movements into a mental map. For Weisberg, the only way he\nlearns spaces in an integrated way is by paying attention to major cardinal\ndirections or prominent landmarks like the ocean. \u201cThe more attention I pay,\nthe better I can link things to the map in my head.\u201d He recommends that\nstruggling navigators ask themselves which way is north 10 times a day,\nreferring to a map if necessary. This, he suggests, could help them move\nbeyond mere route knowledge.\n\nThere\u2019s another option for those who don\u2019t really care about improving their\nskills as long as they just don\u2019t get lost, Weisberg notes: Just make sure\nyour GPS is handy.\n\n10.1146/knowable-041024-1\n\nBob Holmes is a science writer based in Edmonton, Canada, and a special\ncontributor for Knowable Magazine.
