That question may sound odd, owing to\nthe sheer commonness of the act in question; in the twenty-twenties, we take\nphotographs and share them worldwide without giving it a second thought. But\nin the nineteen-thirties, almost everyone who sent a photo did so through the\nmail, if they did it at all. Not that there weren\u2019t more efficient means of\ntransmission, at least to professionals in the cutting-edge newspaper\nindustry: as dramatized in the short 1937 documentary above, the visual\naccompaniment to a sufficiently important scoop could also be sent in mere\nminutes through the miracle of wire.\n\n\u201cTraveling almost as fast as the telephone story, wired photos now go across\nthe continent with the speed of light,\u201d declares the narrator in breathless\nnewsreel-announcer style. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of sending the whole picture at\nonce, but of separating the picture into fine lines, sending those lines over\na wire, and assembling them at the other end.\u201d\n\nIllustrating this process is a clever mechanical prop involving two spindles\non a hand crank, and a length of rope printed with the image of a car that\nunwinds from one spindle onto the other. To ensure the viewer\u2019s complete\nunderstanding, animated diagrams also reveal the inner workings of the actual\nscanning, sending, and receiving apparatus.\n\nThis process may now seem impossibly cumbersome, but at the time it\nrepresented a leap forward for mass visual media. In the decades after the\nSecond World War, the same basic principle \u2014 that of disassembling an image\ninto lines at one point in order to reassemble it at another \u2014 would be\nemployed in the homes and offices of ordinary Americans by devices such as the\ntelevision set and fax machine. We know, as the viewers of 1937 didn\u2019t, just\nhow those analog technologies would change the character of life and work in\nthe twentieth century. As for what their digital descendants will do to the\ntwenty-first century, as they continue to break down all existence into not\nlines but bits, we\u2019ve only just begun to find out.\n\nvia Kids Should See This\n\nRelated content:\n\nThe History of Photography in Five Animated Minutes: From Camera Obscura to\nCamera Phone\n\nWatch a Local TV Station Switch From Black & White to Color for First Time\n(1967)\n\nCreative Uses of the Fax Machine: From Iggy Pop\u2019s Bile to Stephen Hawking\u2019s\nSnark\n\nThe History of American Newspapers Has Been Digitized: Explore 114 Years of\nEditor & Publisher, \u201cthe Bible of the Newspaper Industry\u201d\n\nFrom the Annals of Optimism: The Newspaper Industry in 1981 Imagines its\nDigital Future\n\nBased in Seoul, Colin Marshall writes and broadcasts on cities, language, and\nculture.
