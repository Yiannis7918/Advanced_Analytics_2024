The second character is a component of the Chinese\nword for opportunity (j\u012bhu\u00ec, \u673a\u4f1a; \u6a5f\u6703), but has multiple meanings, and in\nisolation means something more like 'change point' or inflection point. The\nmistaken etymology became a trope after it was used by John F. Kennedy in his\npresidential campaign speeches and is widely repeated in business, education,\npolitics and the press in the United States.\n\n## Origin[edit]\n\nSinologist Victor H. Mair of the University of Pennsylvania states the popular\ninterpretation of weiji as \"danger\" plus \"opportunity\" is a \"widespread public\nmisperception\" in the English-speaking world. The first character w\u0113i (\u5371) does\nindeed mean \"dangerous\" or \"precarious\", but the second, highly polysemous,\ncharacter j\u012b (\u673a; \u6a5f) does not mean \"opportunity\" in isolation, but something\nmore like \"change point\". The confusion likely arises from the fact that the\ncharacter for j\u012b is a component of the Chinese word for \"opportunity\", j\u012bhu\u00ec\n(\u673a\u4f1a; \u6a5f\u6703).^[2]^[3]^[4]\n\n## History[edit]\n\nAmerican linguist Benjamin Zimmer has traced mentions in English of the\nChinese term for \"crisis\" as far as an anonymous editorial in a 1938 journal\nfor missionaries in China.^[5]^[2] The American public intellectual Lewis\nMumford contributed to the spread of this idea in 1944 when he wrote: \"The\nChinese symbol for crisis is composed of two elements: one signifies danger\nand the other opportunity.\"^[6] However, its use likely gained momentum in the\nUnited States after John F. Kennedy employed this trope in presidential\ncampaign speeches in 1959 and 1960, possibly paraphrasing Mumford:^[2] \"In the\nChinese language, the word \"crisis\" is composed of two characters, one\nrepresenting danger and the other, opportunity.\"^[7]^[8]\n\nThe word has since become a staple meme for American business consultants and\nmotivational speakers, as well as gaining popularity in educational\ninstitutions, politics and the popular press. For example, in 2007, Secretary\nof State Condoleezza Rice applied it during Middle East peace talks.^[9]\nFormer Vice President Al Gore has done so numerous times, such as in testimony\nbefore the U.S. House of Representatives, in the introduction of An\nInconvenient Truth, and in his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance lecture.^[10]^[11]\n\nBenjamin Zimmer attributes the appeal of this anecdote to its \"handiness\" as a\nrhetorical device and optimistic \"call to action\",^[12] as well as to \"wishful\nthinking\".^[4]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * May you live in interesting times\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \u6559\u80b2\u90e8\u91cd\u7de8\u570b\u8a9e\u8fad\u5178\u4fee\u8a02\u672c (in Chinese (Taiwan)).
