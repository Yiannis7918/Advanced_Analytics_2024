Worldwide losses were estimated at\nUS$1.71 trillion.^[2] The severity of the crash sparked fears of extended\neconomic instability^[3] or even a reprise of the Great Depression.^[4]\n\nPossible explanations for the initial fall in stock prices include a nervous\nfear that stocks were significantly overvalued and were certain to undergo a\ncorrection, persistent US trade and budget deficits, and rising interest\nrates. Another explanation for Black Monday comes from the decline of the\ndollar, followed by a lack of faith in governmental attempts to stop that\ndecline. In February 1987, leading industrial countries had signed the Louvre\nAccord, hoping that monetary policy coordination would stabilize international\nmoney markets, but doubts about the viability of the accord created a crisis\nof confidence. The fall may have been accelerated by portfolio insurance\nhedging (using computer-based models to buy or sell index futures in various\nstock market conditions) or a self-reinforcing contagion of fear.\n\nThe degree to which the stock market crashes spread to the wider (or \"real\")\neconomy was directly related to the monetary policy each nation pursued in\nresponse. The central banks of the United States, West Germany, and Japan\nprovided market liquidity to prevent debt defaults among financial\ninstitutions, and the impact on the real economy was relatively limited and\nshort-lived. However, refusal to loosen monetary policy by the Reserve Bank of\nNew Zealand had sharply negative and relatively long-term consequences for\nboth its financial markets and real economy.^[5]\n\n## United States[edit]\n\n### Background[edit]\n\nTimeline compiled by the US Federal Reserve\n\nDuring a strong five-year bull market,^[6]^[A] the Dow Jones Industrial\nAverage (DJIA) rose from 776 in August 1982 to a peak of 2,722 in August\n1987.^[8] The same bullish trend propelled market indices around the world\nover this period, as the nineteen largest enjoyed an average rise of 296\npercent.^[9]\n\nOn the morning of Wednesday, October 14, 1987, the United States House\nCommittee on Ways and Means introduced a bill to reduce the tax benefits\nassociated with financing mergers and leveraged buyouts. Unexpectedly high\ntrade deficit figures announced on October 14 by the United States Department\nof Commerce had a further negative impact on the value of the US dollar while\npushing interest rates upward and stock prices downward.^[10] As the day\ncontinued, the DJIA dropped 95.46 points (3.81 percent) to 2,412.70, and it\nfell another 57.61 points (2.39 percent) the next day, down over 12 percent\nfrom the August 25 all-time high. On Friday, October 16, the DJIA fell 108.35\npoints (4.6 percent).^[11] The drop on the 14th was the earliest significant\ndecline among all countries that would later be affected by Black Monday.^[12]\n\nThough the markets were closed for the weekend, significant selling pressure\nstill existed. The computer models of portfolio insurers continued to dictate\nvery large sales.^[13] Moreover, some large mutual fund groups had procedures\nthat enabled customers to easily redeem their shares during the weekend at the\nsame prices that existed at the close of market on Friday.^[14] The amount of\nthese redemption requests was far greater than the firms' cash reserves,\nrequiring them to make large sales of shares as soon as the market opened on\nthe following Monday. Finally, some traders anticipated these pressures and\ntried to get ahead of the market by selling early and aggressively on Monday,\nbefore the anticipated price drop.^[13]\n\n### The Crash[edit]\n\nBefore the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) opened on October 19, 1987, there\nwas pent-up pressure to sell. When the market opened, a large imbalance arose\nbetween the volume of sell and buy orders, placing downward pressure on\nprices. Regulations at the time allowed designated market makers (or\n\"specialists\") to delay or suspend trading in a stock if the order imbalance\nexceeded the specialist's ability to fulfill in an orderly manner.^[15] The\nimbalance on October 19 was so large that 95 stocks on the S&P 500 Index (S&P)\nopened late, as also did 11 of the 30 DJIA stocks.^[16] Importantly, however,\nthe futures market opened on time across the board, with heavy selling.^[16]\n\nOn that Monday, the DJIA fell 508 points (22.6 percent), accompanied by\ncrashes in the futures exchanges and options markets;^[17] the largest one-day\npercentage drop in the history of the DJIA.^[18] Significant selling created\nsteep price declines throughout the day, particularly during the last 90\nminutes of trading.^[19] Deluged with sell orders, many stocks on the NYSE\nfaced trading halts and delays. Of the 2,257 NYSE-listed stocks, there were\n195 trading delays and halts that day.^[20] Total trading volume was so large\nthat the computer and communications systems were overwhelmed, leaving orders\nunfilled for an hour or more. Large funds transfers were delayed and the\nFedwire and NYSE SuperDot systems shut down for extended periods further\ncompounding traders' confusion.^[21]\n\n### Margin calls and liquidity[edit]\n\nFrederic Mishkin suggested that the greatest economic danger was not events on\nthe day of the crash itself, but the potential for \"spreading collapse of\nsecurities firms\" if an extended liquidity crisis in the securities industry\nbegan to threaten the solvency and viability of brokerage houses and\nspecialists. This possibility first loomed on the day after the crash.^[22] At\nleast initially, there was a very real risk that these institutions could\nfail.^[23] If that happened, spillover effects could sweep over the entire\nfinancial system, with negative consequences for the real economy as a\nwhole.^[24] As Robert R. Glauber stated, \"From our perspective on the Brady\nCommission, Black Monday may have been frightening, but it was the capital-\nliquidity problem on Tuesday that was horrifying.\"^[25]\n\nThe source of these liquidity problems was a general increase in margin calls;\nafter the market's plunge, these were about ten times their average size and\nthree times greater than the highest previous levels.^[26] Several firms had\ninsufficient cash in customers' accounts (that is, they were\n\"undersegregated\"). Firms drawing funds from their own capital to meet the\nshortfall sometimes became undercapitalized; 11 firms received margin calls\nfor a single customer that exceeded that firm's adjusted net capital,\nsometimes by as much as two-to-one.^[23] Investors needed to repay end-of-day\nmargin calls made on October 19 before the opening of the market on October\n20. Clearinghouse member firms called on lending institutions to extend credit\nto cover these sudden and unexpected charges, but the brokerages requesting\nadditional credit began to exceed their credit limit. Banks were also worried\nabout increasing their involvement and exposure to a chaotic market.^[27] The\nsize and urgency of the demands for credit placed upon banks was\nunprecedented.^[28] In general, counterparty risk increased as the\ncreditworthiness of counterparties and the value of collateral posted became\nhighly uncertain.^[29]\n\n### Federal Reserve response[edit]\n\n\"[T]he response of monetary policy to the crash,\" according to economist\nMichael Mussa, \"was massive, immediate and appropriate.\"^[30] One day after\nthe crash, the Federal Reserve (Fed) began to act as the lender of last resort\nto counter the crisis.^[31] Its crisis management approach included issuing a\nterse, decisive public pronouncement; supplying liquidity through open market\noperations;^[32]^[B] persuading banks to lend to securities firms; and in a\nfew specific cases, direct action tailored to a few firms' needs.^[34]\n\nOn the morning of October 20, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan made a brief\nstatement: \"The Federal Reserve, consistent with its responsibilities as the\nNation's central bank, affirmed today its readiness to serve as a source of\nliquidity to support the economic and financial system\".^[35] Fed sources\nsuggested that the brevity was deliberate, in order to avoid\nmisinterpretations.^[32] This \"extraordinary\"^[36] announcement probably had a\ncalming effect on markets^[37] that were facing an equally unprecedented\ndemand for liquidity^[28] and the immediate potential for a liquidity\ncrisis.^[38] The market rallied after that announcement, gaining around 200\npoints, but the rally was short-lived. By noon the gains had been erased and\nthe slide had resumed.^[39]\n\nThe Fed then acted to provide market liquidity and prevent the crisis from\nexpanding into other markets. It immediately began injecting its reserves into\nthe financial system via purchases on the open market. On October 20 it\ninjected $17 billion into the banking system through the open market \u2013 an\namount that was more than 25 percent of bank reserve balances and 7 percent of\nthe monetary base of the entire nation.^[40] This rapidly pushed the federal\nfunds rate down by 0.5 percent. The Fed continued its expansive open market\npurchases of securities for weeks. The Fed also repeatedly began these\ninterventions an hour before the regularly scheduled time, notifying dealers\nof the schedule change on the evening beforehand. This was all done in a very\nhigh-profile and public manner, similar to Greenspan's initial announcement,\nto restore market confidence that liquidity was forthcoming.^[41] Although the\nFed's holdings expanded appreciably over time, the speed of expansion was not\nexcessive.^[42] Moreover, the Fed later disposed of these holdings so that its\nlong-term policy goals would not be adversely affected.^[32]\n\nThe Fed successfully met the unprecedented demands for credit^[43] by pairing\na strategy of moral suasion that motivated nervous banks to lend to securities\nfirms alongside its moves to reassure those banks by actively supplying them\nwith liquidity.^[44] As economist Ben Bernanke (who was later to become\nChairman of the Federal Reserve) wrote:\n\n> The Fed's key action was to induce the banks (by suasion and by the supply\n> of liquidity) to make loans, on customary terms, despite chaotic conditions\n> and the possibility of severe adverse selection of borrowers. In\n> expectation, making these loans must have been a money-losing strategy from\n> the point of view of the banks (and the Fed); otherwise, Fed persuasion\n> would not have been needed.^[45]\n\nThe Fed's two-part strategy was thoroughly successful, since lending to\nsecurities firms by large banks in Chicago and especially in New York\nincreased substantially, often nearly doubling.^[46]\n\n## International[edit]\n\nAll of the twenty-three major world markets experienced a sharp decline in\nOctober 1987.^[47] Stock markets crashed worldwide, first in Asian markets\nother than Japan, then Europe, then the US, and finally Japan.^[48] When\nmeasured in United States dollars, eight markets declined by 20 to 29 percent,\nthree by 30 to 39 percent (Malaysia, Mexico and New Zealand), and three by\nmore than 40 percent (Hong Kong, Australia and Singapore).^[47]^[C] The least\naffected was Austria (a fall of 11.4 percent) while the most affected was Hong\nKong with a drop of 45.8 percent. Out of twenty-three major industrial\ncountries, nineteen had a decline greater than 20 percent.^[50] Worldwide\nlosses were estimated at US$1.71 trillion.^[2] The severity of the crash\nsparked fears of extended economic instability^[3] or even a reprise of the\nGreat Depression.^[4]\n\n### United Kingdom[edit]\n\nFTSE 100 Index of the London Stock Exchange (June 19, 1987, to January 19,\n1988)\n\nOn Friday, October 16, all the markets in London were unexpectedly closed due\nto the Great Storm of 1987. After they re-opened, the speed of the crash\naccelerated. By midday, the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index (FTSE\n100) had fallen 296 points, a 14 percent drop.^[51] It was down 23 percent in\ntwo days, roughly the same percentage that the NYSE dropped on the day of the\ncrash. Stocks then continued to fall, albeit at a less precipitous rate, until\nreaching a trough in mid-November at 36 percent below its pre-crash peak.\nStocks did not begin to recover until 1989.^[52]\n\n### Japan[edit]\n\nMain article: Economy of Japan\n\nIn Japan, the October 1987 crash is sometimes referred to as \"Blue Tuesday\",\nbecause of the time zone difference, and its effects were relatively mild.^[2]\nAccording to economist Ulrike Schaede, the initial market break was severe:\nthe Tokyo market declined 14.9 percent in one day, and Japan's losses of\nUS$421 billion ranked next to New York's $500 billion, out of a worldwide\ntotal loss of $1.7 trillion. However, systemic differences between the US and\nJapanese financial systems led to significantly different outcomes during and\nafter the crash on Tuesday, October 20. In Japan the ensuing panic was no more\nthan mild at worst: the Nikkei 225 Index returned to its pre-crash levels\nafter only five months. Other global markets performed less well in the\naftermath of the crash, with New York, London and Frankfurt all needing more\nthan a year to achieve the same level of recovery.^[53]\n\nSeveral of Japan's distinctive institutional characteristics already in place\nat the time, according to economist David D. Hale, helped dampen volatility.\nThese included trading curbs such as a sharp limit on price movements of a\nshare of more than 10 to 15 percent; restrictions and institutional barriers\nto short-selling by domestic and international traders; frequent adjustments\nof margin requirements in response to changes in volatility; strict guidelines\non mutual fund redemptions; and actions of the Ministry of Finance to control\nthe total shares of stock and exert moral suasion on the securities\nindustry.^[54] An example of the latter occurred when the ministry invited\nrepresentatives of the four largest securities firms to tea in the early\nafternoon of the day of the crash.^[55] After their visit to the ministry,\nthese firms made large purchases of stock in Nippon Telegraph and\nTelephone.^[55]\n\n### Hong Kong[edit]\n\nMain article: Economy of Hong Kong\n\nThe worst decline among world markets was in Hong Kong, where share values\ndropped by 45.8 percent.^[50] In its biggest-ever single fall, the Hang Seng\nIndex of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange fell by 420.81 points, eliminating HK$65\nbillion' (10 percent) of its share value.^[56] Noting the continued fall of\nNew York markets on their next trading day and fearing steep drops or total\ncollapse of their own exchanges, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange Committee and\nthe committee of the Futures Exchange announced the following morning that\nboth would be closed. Their closure lasted for four working days.^[57] Their\ndecision was motivated in part by the high risk that a market collapse would\nhave serious consequences for the entire financial system of Hong Kong, and\nperhaps result in rioting, with the added threat of intervention by the army\nof the People's Republic of China.^[58] According to Neil Gunningham, a\nfurther motivation was brought on by a significant conflict of interest: many\nof these committee members were themselves futures brokers, and their firms\nwere in danger of substantial defaults from their clients.^[57]\n\nAlthough the stock exchange was in distress, structural flaws in the futures\nexchange, which was then the world's most heavily traded outside the U.S.,\nwere at the heart of the greater financial crisis.^[56] The structure of the\nHong Kong Futures Exchange differed greatly from many other exchanges around\nthe world. In many countries, large institutional investors dominate the\nmarket.^[59] Their principal motivation for futures transactions is\nhedging.^[60] In Hong Kong, the market itself, as well as many of its traders\nand brokers, was inexperienced. It was composed heavily of small, local\ninvestors who were relatively uninformed and unsophisticated, had only a\nshort-term commitment to the market, and whose goals were primarily\nspeculative rather than hedging. Among all parties involved, there was little\nor no expectation of the possibility of a crash or a steep decline or\nunderstanding of the consequences of such a fall.^[61] In fact, speculative\ninvesting that depended on the bull market to continue was prevalent among\nindividual investors, often including the brokers themselves.^[62]\n\nThe key shortcomings of the futures exchange, however, were mismanagement and\na failure of regulatory diligence and design. These failures were particularly\ngrave in the area of credit control. In Hong Kong, the approach to credit\ninvolved a system of margins and margin calls plus a Guarantee Corporation\nbacked by a guarantee fund. Although on paper the Hong Kong exchange's margin\nrequirements were in line with those of other major markets, in practice\nbrokers regularly extended credit with little regard for risk. In a lax,\nfreewheeling and fiercely competitive environment, margin requirements were\nroutinely cut in half and sometimes ignored altogether. Hong Kong also had no\nsuitability requirements that would force brokers to screen their customers\nfor ability to repay any debts.^[63] The absence of oversight creates an\nimbalance of risk due to moral hazard: it becomes profitable for traders with\nlow cash reserves to speculate in futures, reaping benefits if they speculate\ncorrectly, but simply defaulting if their hunches are wrong.^[64] If there is\na wave of dishonored contracts, brokers become liable for their clients'\nlosses, potentially facing bankruptcy themselves.^[65] Finally, the Guarantee\nCorporation was severely underfunded, with capital on hand of only HK$15\nmillion (US$2 million). That amount was obviously inadequate for dealing with\nany large number of clients' defaults in a market trading around 14,000\ncontracts a day, with an underlying value of HK$4.3 billion.^[66]\n\nThe crash initially left about 36,400 contracts worth HK$6.7 billion [US$1\nbillion] outstanding. As late as April 1988, HK$800 million had not been\nsettled.^[67] According to Neil Gunningham, the accumulative impact was nearly\nfatal to the Hong Kong futures market: \"Whereas futures exchanges elsewhere\n[in the world] emerged from the crash with only minor casualties, the crisis\nin Hong Kong has resulted, at least in the short term, in the virtual\ndemolition of the Futures Exchange.\"^[68] Finally, in the interest of\npreserving political stability and public order, the Hong Kong government was\nforced to rescue the Guarantee Fund by providing a bail-out package of HK$4\nbillion dollars.^[69]\n\n### New Zealand[edit]\n\nMain article: Economy of New Zealand\n\nThe crash of the New Zealand stock market was notably long and deep,\ncontinuing its decline for an extended period after other global markets had\nrecovered.^[70] Unlike other nations, moreover, for New Zealand the effects of\nthe October 1987 crash spilled over into its real economy, contributing to a\nprolonged recession.^[71]\n\nThe effects of the worldwide economic boom of the mid-1980s had been amplified\nin New Zealand by the relaxation of foreign exchange controls and a wave of\nbanking deregulation. Deregulation in particular suddenly gave financial\ninstitutions considerably more freedom to lend, though they had little\nexperience in doing so.^[72] The finance industry was in a state of increasing\noptimism that approached euphoria.^[73] This created an atmosphere conducive\nto greater financial risk taking including increased speculation in the stock\nmarket and real estate. Foreign investors participated, attracted by New\nZealand's relatively high interest rates. From late 1984 until Black Monday,\ncommercial property prices and commercial construction rose sharply, while\nshare prices in the stock market tripled.^[72]\n\nNew Zealand's stock market fell nearly 15 percent on the first day.^[74] In\nthe following three-and-a-half months, the value of its market shares was cut\nin half.^[75] By the time it reached its trough in February 1988, the market\nhad lost 60 percent of its value.^[74] The financial crisis triggered a wave\nof deleveraging with significant macro-economic consequences. Investment\ncompanies and property developers began a fire sale of their properties,\npartially to help offset their share price losses, and partially because the\ncrash had exposed overbuilding. Moreover, these firms had been using property\nas collateral for their increased borrowing. When property values collapsed,\nthe health of balance sheets of lending institutions was damaged.^[74]\n\nHolding onto a disinflationary stance, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand\ndeclined to loosen monetary policy \u2013 which would have helped firms settle\ntheir obligations and remain in operation.^[76] As the harmful effects spread\nover the next few years, major corporations and financial institutions went\nout of business, and the banking systems of New Zealand and Australia were\nimpaired, contributing to a \"long recession\".^[77] Access to credit was\nreduced.^[74] In fact, because of legislation requiring the Reserve Bank of\nNew Zealand to achieve an inflation rate no higher than 2 percent by 1993,\ninterest rates were volatile, with multiple increases.^[78] The combination of\nthese contributed significantly to a long recession running from 1987 until\n1993.^[74]\n\n## Causes[edit]\n\nDiscussions of the causes of the Black Monday crash focus on two theoretical\nmodels, which differ in whether they emphasise on variables that are exogenous\nor endogenous. The first searches for exogenous factors, such as significant\nnews events, that affect or \"trigger\" investor behavior. The second, \"cascade\ntheory\" or \"market meltdown\", attempts to identify endogenous internal market\ndynamics and interactions of systemic variables or trading strategies^[79]\nsuch that an order imbalance leads to a price change, this price change in\nturn leads to further order imbalance, which leads to further price changes,\nand so on in a spiralling cascade.^[80] It is possible that both could occur,\nif a trigger sets off a cascade.^[79]\n\n### Market forces[edit]\n\nSeveral events have been cited as potential triggers for the initial fall in\nstock prices. One of these was a proposed tax change that would make corporate\ntakeovers more costly.^[81] However, Nobel-prize winning economist Robert J.\nShiller surveyed 889 investors (605 individual investors and 284 institutional\ninvestors) immediately after the crash regarding several aspects of their\nexperience at the time. Only three institutional investors and no individual\ninvestors reported a belief that the news regarding proposed tax legislation\nwas a trigger for the crash.^[82]\n\nOther factors often cited include a general feeling that stocks were\novervalued and were certain to undergo a correction, the decline of the\ndollar, persistent trade and budget deficits, and rising interest rates.^[81]\nAccording to Shiller, the most common responses to his survey were related to\na general mindset of investors at the time: a \"gut feeling\" of an impending\ncrash\", perhaps driven by excessive debt.^[82] This aligns with an account\nsuggested by economist Martin Feldstein, who has made the argument that\nseveral of these institutional and market factors exerted pressure in an\nenvironment of general anxiety.^[83] Feldstein suggests that the stock market\nwas in a speculative bubble that kept prices \"too high by historic and\nsustainable standards\".^[84] The real economy was doing well, profits and\nearnings were rising, but stock prices were rising faster than the underlying\nprofits would warrant. These capital gains created high price-earnings ratios\nthat were unsupportable.^[83] There was a common perception that the market\nwas overpriced, and that a correction was certain to occur.^[9] At the same\ntime tight monetary policy and a market expectation of continued tightening\nwere driving up interest rates. Bad trade figures from August were announced\nin October. This created an anticipation that the Fed would raise interest\nrates again. With the stock market appearing overextended and interest rates\nrising, a switch from stocks to bonds began to appear increasingly\nattractive.^[83] Yet investors were also hesitant to make this move:\n\"...everybody knew the market was overpriced, but everybody was greedy and\ndidn't want to miss out on a continuation of the wonderful rise that had been\ngoing on since the beginning of the year. But they were very, very\nnervous\".^[85] As a final catalyst, there was also concern that portfolio\ninsurance would greatly accelerate any drop into an avalanche whenever it\nbegan. A return to equilibrium was thus inevitable, but when the bubble burst,\nthe combination of portfolio selling, and significant market nervousness\nbrought a sharp crash.^[83]\n\nA second explanation for the crash lies in a crisis of confidence in the\ndollar created by uncertainties regarding the viability of the Louvre\nAccord.^[86] International investment in the US stock market had expanded\nsignificantly in the prolonged bull market. However, trade and budget deficits\nwere bringing both downward pressure on the dollar and an expectation of\nhigher interest rates. These factors and others motivated the industrialized\nnations (and in particular, the US, Japan and West Germany) to reach the\nLouvre agreement with several related goals in mind, one of which was to keep\na floor beneath the value of the dollar while holding exchange rates within a\nspecified band or reference range of one another. However, the market had\nlimited confidence in the willingness of governments to abide by these\nagreements.^[87] The central banks of Japan and West Germany had been vocal\nabout their fears of rising inflation; this created an expectation that these\ncountries would raise interest rates to reduce liquidity and quell\ninflationary pressures. If those countries raised their rates, then in order\nto keep all countries within the agreed range of each other, the US would be\nexpected to raise rates as well.^[88] When the Bundesbank followed through on\nits remarks and took steps to raise short-term interest rates, US Treasury\nSecretary James Baker publicly clashed with the Germans, making remarks that\nwere interpreted as a threat to devalue the dollar.^[89] Even under normal\ncircumstances, a weaker dollar would tend to make US stocks look less\nattractive to foreign investors.^[90] These remarks, however, created shock\nand panic among investors outside the US.^[91] They raised the prospect of a\ncurrency war, or even the collapse of the dollar,^[92] an anonymous senior\nReagan administration later summarized the fear and uncertainty in investor's\nminds after Baker's statement:\n\n> ...wait a minute. If [Baker] is using it as a lever [to influence the\n> Bundesbank] and we believe it won't work, there is no bottom. If he isn't\n> using it as a lever, and he just actually wants the dollar to go down, then\n> there is no stability. And if he isn't clear whether it is one or the other\n> of those, then he doesn't understand his own system and his own business,\n> and we'll have a problem of confidence.^[93]\n\nIn this account, the result was a punishing selloff that started in Asia and\nspread to Europe and the US as markets opened up across the world.^[94]\n\n### Market meltdown[edit]\n\n#### De-linked markets and index arbitrage[edit]\n\nUnder normal circumstances the stock market and those of its main\nderivatives\u2013futures and options\u2013are functionally a single market, given that\nthe price of any particular stock is closely connected to the prices of its\ncounterpart in both the futures and options market.^[95] Prices in the\nderivative markets are typically tightly connected to those of the underlying\nstock, though they differ somewhat (as for example, prices of futures are\ntypically higher than that of their particular cash stock).^[96] During the\ncrisis this link was broken.^[97]\n\nWhen the futures market opened while the stock market was closed, it created a\npricing imbalance: the listed price of those stocks which opened late had no\nchance to change from their closing price of the day before. The quoted prices\nwere thus \"stale\" and did not reflect current economic conditions; they were\ngenerally listed higher than they should have been (and dramatically higher\nthan their respective futures, which are typically higher than stocks).^[98]\n\nThe decoupling of these markets meant that futures prices had temporarily lost\ntheir validity as a vehicle for price discovery; they no longer could be\nrelied upon to inform traders of the direction or degree of stock market\nexpectations. This had harmful effects: it added to the atmosphere of\nuncertainty and confusion at a time when investor confidence was sorely\nneeded; it discouraged investors from \"leaning against the wind\" and buying\nstocks since the discount in the futures market logically implied that\ninvestors could wait and purchase stocks at an even lower price; and it\nencouraged portfolio insurance investors to sell in the stock market, putting\nfurther downward pressure on stock prices.^[99]\n\nThe gap between the futures and stocks was quickly noted by index arbitrage\ntraders who tried to profit through sell at market orders. Index arbitrage, a\nform of program trading,^[100] added to the confusion and the downward\npressure on prices:^[16]\n\n> ...reflecting the natural linkages among markets, the selling pressure\n> washed across to the stock market, both through index arbitrage and direct\n> portfolio insurance stock sales. Large amounts of selling, and the demand\n> for liquidity associated with it, cannot be contained in a single market\n> segment. It necessarily overflows into the other market segments, which are\n> naturally linked. There are, however, natural limits to intermarket\n> liquidity which were made evident on October 19 and 20.^[101]\n\nAlthough arbitrage between index futures and stocks placed downward pressure\non prices, it does not explain why the surge in sell orders that brought steep\nprice declines began in the first place.^[102] Moreover, the markets\n\"performed most chaotically\" during those times when the links that index\narbitrage program trading creates between these markets was broken.^[103]\n\n#### Portfolio insurance hedges[edit]\n\nPortfolio insurance is a hedging technique which seeks to manage risk and\nlimit losses by buying and selling financial instruments (for example, stocks\nor futures) in reaction to changes in market price rather than changes in\nmarket fundamentals. Specifically, they buy when the market is rising, and\nsell as the market falls, without regard for any fundamental information about\nwhy the market is rising or falling.^[104] Thus, it is an example of an\n\"informationless trade\"^[105] that has the potential to create a market-\ndestabilizing feedback loop.^[106]\n\nThis strategy became a source of downward pressure when portfolio insurers\nwhose computer models noted that stocks opened lower and continued their steep\nprice decline. The models recommended even further sales.^[16] The potential\nfor computer-generated feedback loops that these hedges created has been\ndiscussed as a factor compounding the severity of the crash, but not as an\ninitial trigger.^[107] Economist Hayne Leland argues against this\ninterpretation, suggesting that the impact of portfolio hedging on stock\nprices was probably relatively small.^[108] Similarly, the report of the\nChicago Mercantile Exchange found the influence of \"other investors\u2014mutual\nfunds, broker-dealers, and individual shareholders\u2014was thus three to five\ntimes greater than that of the portfolio insurers\" during the crash.^[109]\nNumerous econometric studies have analyzed the evidence to determine whether\nportfolio insurance exacerbated the crash, but the results have been\nunclear.^[110] Markets around the world that did not have portfolio insurance\ntrading experienced as much turmoil and loss as the US market.^[111] More to\nthe point, the cross-market analysis of Richard Roll, for example, found that\nmarkets with a greater prevalence of computerized trading (including portfolio\ninsurance) actually experienced relatively less severe losses (in percentage\nterms) than those without.^[112]\n\n#### Noise trading[edit]\n\nContemporaneous causality and feedback behavior between markets increased\ndramatically during this period.^[113] In a volatile and uncertain market,\ninvestors worldwide^[114] were inferring information from changes in stock\nprices and communication with other investors^[115] in a self-reinforcing\ncontagion of fear.^[114] This pattern of basing trading decisions on market\npsychology is often referred to as one form of \"noise trading\", which occurs\nwhen ill-informed investors \"[trade] on noise as if it were news\".^[116] A\nsignificant amount of trading takes place based on information which is\nunquantifiable and potentially irrelevant, such as unsubstantiated rumors or a\n\"gut feeling\".^[117] Investors vary between seemingly rational and irrational\nbehaviors as they \"struggle to find their way between the give and take,\nbetween risk and return, one moment engaging in cool calculation and the next\nyielding to emotional impulses\".^[118] If noise is misinterpreted as\nmeaningful news, then the reactions of risk-averse traders and arbitrageurs\nwill bias the market, preventing it from establishing prices that accurately\nreflect the fundamental state of the underlying stocks.^[119] For example, on\nOctober 19 rumors that the NYSE would close created additional confusion and\ndrove prices further downward, while rumors the next day that two Chicago\nMercantile Exchange clearinghouses were insolvent deterred some investors from\ntrading in that marketplace.^[120]\n\nA feedback loop of noise-induced-volatility has been cited by some analysts as\nthe major reason for the severe depth of the crash. It does not, however,\nexplain what initially triggered the market break.^[121] Moreover, Lawrence A.\nCunningham has suggested that while noise theory is \"supported by substantial\nempirical evidence and a well-developed intellectual foundation\", it makes\nonly a partial contribution toward explaining events such as the crash of\nOctober 1987.^[122] Informed traders, not swayed by psychological or emotional\nfactors, have room to make trades they know to be less risky.^[123]\n\n## Aftermath[edit]\n\nAfter Black Monday, regulators overhauled trade-clearing protocols to bring\nuniformity to all prominent market products. They also developed new\nregulatory instruments, known as \"trading curbs\" or \"circuit breakers\",\nallowing exchanges to temporarily halt in instances of exceptionally large\nprice decline; for instance, the DJIA.^[124] The curbs were implemented\nmultiple times during the 2020 stock market crash.^[125]\n\nArguably, a second consequence of the crash was the death of the Louvre\nAccord.^[126] Its intent was already being defeated by market forces as early\nas April of that year. Then the response of the Reagan administration to the\ncrash was to deliberately let both interest rates and the value of the dollar\nfall to provide liquidity. They later resumed some interventions on behalf of\nthe dollar until December 1988, but eventually it became clear that\n\"international currency coordination of any kind, including a target zone, is\nnot possible.\"^[127]\n\nThe crash of 1987 altered implied volatility patterns that arise in pricing\nfinancial options. Equity options traded in American markets did not show a\nvolatility smile before the crash but began showing one afterward.^[128]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * 2010 Flash Crash\n  * List of largest daily changes in the Dow Jones Industrial Average\n  * Wall Street Crash of 1929 (Black Tuesday)\n  * Black Monday (TV series)\n  * Black Monday (2020)\n\n## Footnotes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Explanations [for the extended bull market] include \"...improved earnings growth prospects, a decrease in the equity risk premium...
