There were 101 Republicans and 210 Democrats who voted in\nfavor, while Rep. Dan Meuser, R-Pa., voted present. All 112 votes against came\nfrom Republicans.\n\nThe Israel bill passed 366-58, with 193 Republicans and 173 Democrats voting\nin favor.\n\nThe passage of the bills comes weeks after the Senate passed a mammoth bill\nwith aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, plus funding for border security.\nSpeaker Mike Johnson refused to bring that bill to the floor, instead opting\nto pass three separate bills with aid for the three nations.\n\nThe Ukraine aid bill comes at a crucial time in the country\u2019s war with Russia,\nas Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has expressed the urgent need for\nweapons and supplies to continue defending Ukraine from Russian attacks.\n\nThe House also voted on Saturday to force TikTok\u2019s parent company to sell it\nor be banned in the U.S. The measure includes a policy to force the China-\nbased ByteDance to sell TikTok within nine months \u2014 which the president could\nextend to a year \u2014 or face a nationwide ban. The policy, which lengthens the\ntime frame for a sale from an earlier House bill, has Senate buy-in along with\nBiden\u2019s support, putting TikTok closer than ever to a ban in the U.S.\n\nThe lower chamber also voted to provide $8.12 billion in aid to Taiwan.\n\nThe House was scheduled to vote in the afternoon on the four bills in\nsuccession, one day after a rare and extraordinary bipartisan coalition teed\nup the votes, with more Democrats (165) than Republicans (151) voting for the\n\u201crule\u201d to proceed to the measures.\n\nThe three foreign aid bills will now go to the Senate for approval. Taken\ntogether, they include the $95 billion aid package championed by Biden, with\nsome changes from the version passed by the Senate two months ago.\n\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., at the Capitol on April 17,\n2024.Aaron Schwartz / Sipa USA via AP\n\nHolding the votes represented an act of defiance by Speaker Mike Johnson,\nR-La., against an outspoken faction of conservative rebels who oppose Ukraine\nfunding and pushed him not to bring it to a vote. Three of them \u2014 Reps.\nMarjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Paul Gosar, R-Ariz. \u2014\nhave threatened to oust him as speaker. The passage of the bill may bring\nGreene one step closer to forcing a vote to remove him.\n\nAfter months of wavering, Johnson sided with Biden, Democrats and the\nRepublicans who believe that helping Ukraine fend off Russian aggression is\nessential to U.S. national security interests, citing briefings he has\nreceived and warning: \u201cVladimir Putin would continue to march through Europe\nif he were allowed.\u201d\n\n### Recommended\n\nCongress\n\n### CongressSenate passes bill renewing key FISA surveillance power moments\nafter it expires\n\nTrump trials\n\n### Trump trialsFrom stare-downs to shut-eye: Trump\u2019s every move in criminal\ntrial under the microscope\n\n\u201cI would rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys,\u201d Johnson told\nreporters, noting that his son will enter the Naval Academy this year. \u201cThis\nis a live-fire exercise for me as it is for so many American families. This is\nnot a game, this is not a joke.\u201d\n\nAhead of the vote, former President Donald Trump issued a confusing statement\nthat sympathized with both the pro- and anti-Ukraine aid factions of the GOP\nwithout taking a clear position.\n\nThe bills are expected to be packaged together and sent to the Senate, which\nwill have to vote on the whole legislation to send it to Biden's desk to sign\ninto law. It\u2019s unclear when that will happen, but Senate Majority Leader Chuck\nSchumer, D-N.Y., and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., are outspoken\nproponents of the foreign aid provisions in the package.\n\n\u201cI hope that President Biden will soon have on his desk long-awaited funding\nto support our friends in Ukraine and Israel and the Indo-Pacific, and aid for\ninnocent civilians in need of humanitarian aid in Gaza and around the world,\u201d\nSchumer said before the House vote, cautioning that Ukraine's hopes against\nRussia would diminish without additional U.S. weapons to defend themselves.\n\nLate Friday, Schumer said the Senate was working to get unanimous agreement to\nmove quickly to vote on the foreign aid legislation. \u201cWe are working on an\nagreement for consideration of the supplemental,\u201d he said on the Senate floor.\n\nMcConnell said earlier this week: \u201cHere\u2019s the political reality: If you think\nthe fall of Afghanistan was bad, the fall of a European capital like Kyiv to\nRussian troops will be unimaginably worse, and if stalled American assistance\nmakes that outcome possible, there\u2019s no question where the blame will land, on\nus.\u201d\n\nSahil Kapur\n\nSahil Kapur is a senior national political reporter for NBC News.\n\nKyle Stewart\n\nKyle Stewart is a field producer covering Congress for NBC News.\n\nRebecca Kaplan and Frank Thorp V contributed.\n\n\u00a9 2024 NBC UNIVERSAL\n\nWe and our partners use cookies on this site to improve our service, perform\nanalytics, personalize advertising, measure advertising performance, and\nremember website preferences.
