Can they be enticed to sell\nthem?\n\nBy Laurel Wamsley\n\nThursday, April 18, 2024 \u2022 5:00 AM EDT\n\nHeard on Weekend Edition Saturday\n\nAmong the many hard truths for those trying to enter America's brutal housing\nmarket, here's one: Baby boomers continue to own many of the country's large\nhouses, even after their households have shrunk to one or two people.\n\nBaby boomer empty nesters own twice as many of the country's three-bedroom-or-\nlarger homes, compared with millennials with kids, according to a recent\nanalysis from Redfin. That means those larger homes aren't hitting the market,\none factor limiting the supply for the younger generations who could use those\nextra bedrooms.\n\nSome baby boomers, the generation now between the ages of 60 and 78, are happy\nin their large homes, using the extra bedrooms for hobbies and visiting\nfamily. Others say they want to downsize, but it just doesn't make sense\nfinancially.\n\n### Some want to downsize, but the numbers don't add up\n\nSherry Murray, 73, and her husband, 80, bought their house in the North Hills\nof Pittsburgh in 1991, for $240,000. It's got four bedrooms, including some\nthey don't use anymore. Many of her friends are in the same boat.\n\n\"What a lot of us have done is not walled off the extra bedrooms, but closed\nthe doors, and you try not to have to maintain them,\" she says. \"It's just too\nmuch house at this point.\"\n\nThe house is paid off, and Murray has wanted to downsize for a while, but she\nsays homes that fit what she's looking for \u2013 2,000 square feet, all on one\nlevel, in the same suburban area \u2013 sell quickly and for a lot of money.\n\nSo they've stayed put.\n\n\"You don't want to be economically stupid. If my house is worth even $650,000,\nI don't want to spend $1.1 million to downsize substantially, knowing that on\ntop of that, I'm probably going to have to pay some [homeowner association]\nfees,\" she says.\n\nSmaller homes can cost more if they're newer, or are part of a community that\nprovides extra services. Some metro areas have few one-story homes, making\nthem hot commodities.\n\nSome homeowners are also affected by what's known as the mortgage lock-in\neffect. While 54% of baby boomer homeowners own their homes free and clear,\naccording to Redfin, most of those with mortgages have low rates. So it\ndoesn't make much sense to take out a new mortgage, with rates now around 7%.\n\n\"It just is a dumb economic decision to spend that much extra money for\ngetting so much less,\" Murray says.\n\nRelated Story: When mortgage rates are too low to give up\n\nAcross the country, many baby boomers are facing their own version of this\ncalculus: It can be cheaper \u2014 and more appealing \u2014 to stay in their current,\nlarge house, than to sell it and move to something smaller.\n\nThis doesn't only affect younger buyers.\n\n\"You've got a pure housing mismatch for older homeowners. They are mismatched\nphysically or functionally with the house that they're in,\" says Gary\nEngelhardt, an economist at Syracuse University who studies aging and housing\nmarkets. \"That's because it's multifloor living. It's stairs. It's also other\nupkeep.\"\n\nEngelhardt says that's a serious concern because it can can lead to things\nlike falls. \"And falls can be very devastating, could have very devastating\nhealth consequences, especially for the oldest old,\" he says. \"In general, we\nwould like to have older homeowners ... matched with their housing in a much\nbetter way than we currently have.\"\n\n### So what could be done?\n\nEngelhardt says there are basically two policy approaches to deal with what's\nhappening.\n\nFirst, he says, is to provide subsidies or tax credits for home modifications\nthat allow older adults to age in the homes they have. While that could make\nseniors' current housing safer, it doesn't put those houses back into the\nmarket.\n\nSecond, encourage building housing that's well suited to older Americans,\nEngelhardt says: \"You promote the construction of new residential units that\nare going to be ADA compliant, that are going to have universal design and all\nthe types of features that lend themselves to a better match of functionality\nat older ages.\"\n\nFor instance, the government could create a tax credit to encourage developers\nto build accessible housing, akin to the Low Income Housing Tax Credit that\nincentivizes building affordable housing.\n\nJenny Schuetz, a housing policy expert at the Brookings Institution, says in\ntrying to incentivize older adults to move out of homes that are now too large\nfor them, different tools are needed depending on their geography and\nfinancial resources. For instance, a lower-income homeowner of a deteriorating\nrow house might be willing to a swap for a newer, smaller apartment in an\nelevator building, if there was a program for that.\n\nRelated Story: Millions of seniors struggle to afford housing \u2014 and it's about\nto get a lot worse\n\nBut longtime California homeowners who've seen their property values skyrocket\nwould likely require a different approach, Schuetz says. There, Proposition 13\nstrictly limits increases in property taxes \u2013 so that many longtime homeowners\npay taxes on a small fraction of their home's value. That created its own\nlock-in effect, though a recent rule change allows those over age 55 to keep\ntheir lower tax rate if they buy and move into a home of equal or lesser\nvalue.\n\n### Building more housing that's attractive to seniors\n\nThere are other policy changes that could make it easier to build housing for\ndifferent life stages and thereby entice boomers to downsize.\n\n\"I think one of the things that we know to be true is that older adults want\nto be able to age in their communities,\" says Danielle Arigoni, managing\ndirector for Policy and Solutions at National Housing Trust. That's where they\nalready have friends and neighbors, doctors and bus routes they know \u2014\nfamiliarity that makes aging in their community possible.\n\nBut many areas, including neighborhoods where a lot of baby boomers live, have\nzoning that only allows single-family homes. That means when older adults\ndecide their current homes are too big, they basically have to move out of\ntheir neighborhoods.\n\n\"People want to be able to age in their communities, but there are very few\noptions available for people who do want to do that but want to downsize,\"\nArigoni says.\n\nSo if cities and states want to encourage more right-sizing, they could change\ntheir zoning rules to allow more types of housing in all neighborhoods.\n(Cities across the country are already working to change their zoning rules,\nfor reasons including boosting supply and lowering housing costs.)\n\nRelated Story: The hottest trend in U.S. cities? Changing zoning rules to\nallow more housing\n\nMunicipalities can also allow and encourage accessory dwelling units (ADUs),\nsecondary dwellings like backyard cottages or basement apartments. Arigoni\nsays these offer lots of advantages for older adults.\n\nFor instance, ADUs can be built all one level, with no steps at all. The\nhomeowners can move into the new, smaller ADU on their property, and make\nmoney renting the larger house \u2014 allowing them to stay in the neighborhood\nthey love, while adding a home to the rental market. The extra space can also\nprovide housing for caregivers or family members.\n\nRelated Story: 'Granny Pods' Help Keep Portland Affordable\n\nAnother way to unlock supply in lower-density neighborhoods is to allow\nhomeowners with large lots to split them, generating cash for the homeowner\nwhile creating space for a new house to be built.\n\nMore housing is coming: 1.6 million homes and apartments are currently under\nconstruction in the U.S. That supply should make it easier for buyers to find\nhomes that suit them.\n\nIn the meantime, many baby boomers are sympathetic to what the younger\ngenerations are up against.\n\n\"I really feel sorry for them,\" says Gaurang Patel, 67, a Maryland homeowner\nwho's hoping to downsize and move closer to his adult children. \"They should\nalso get the equal opportunity.\"\n\n### Correction\n\nApr. 18th, 2024\n\nA previous version of this story misspelled Gaurang Patel's first name.
