The internet, she said, should remain \u201ca tool\nfor learning,\u201d not for governments and private companies to \u201cinvade your\nprivacy.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nTwenty-four years later, Cantwell (D-Wash.) has finally unveiled a bipartisan\nagreement aimed at achieving that vision. But the path ahead remains murky. As\nthe Senate Commerce Committee chair, Cantwell has unusual power to regulate\nthe tech industry\u2019s abuses, but her panel\u2019s track record is sparse: Of dozens\nof bills introduced to address privacy, content moderation, even artificial\nintelligence, few have advanced.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where a lot of the tech legislation goes to die is that committee,\u201d\nsaid one House aide. \u201cIt\u2019s a graveyard over there.\u201d\n\nCantwell herself is a primary reason for the impasse, according to more than a\ndozen current and former congressional aides in both parties, and others\nfamiliar with the committee\u2019s dynamics, all of whom spoke on the condition of\nanonymity to speak candidly about the powerful senator. Some said they feared\nretaliation.\n\nCantwell has repeatedly upended privacy negotiations. In 2019, she broke up a\nworking group trying to hash out a compromise. In 2022, she rebuffed a\nlandmark agreement from three key lawmakers, a first-of-its kind bipartisan\ndeal. Again and again, aides said, she has thwarted promising talks by\nrefusing to iron out key disputes, speaking out publicly against colleagues\u2019\nefforts and not empowering her staff to fully negotiate.\n\nCantwell spokeswoman Ansley Lacitis said in a statement Friday that prior\nprivacy negotiations \u201cfell through when they couldn\u2019t agree on strong day-one\nenforcement mechanisms\u201d and other sticking points. Cantwell \u201cappreciates\nstrong staff leadership and has been impressed by staff on negotiating major\npolicy settlement\u201d on issues such as equal pay, prescription drug pricing and\nconsumer fraud, Lacitis said.\n\nSome former Senate aides, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly\ndiscuss dynamics, pushed back on the characterizations in this report. Two\ndescribed the senator as hard-working. \u201cShe\u2019s not a show horse. She gets\nthings done,\u201d said one aide who worked for Cantwell. Another former Cantwell\naide said that while it\u2019s \u201cdefinitely a member-driven office,\u201d the senator is\n\u201cdogged\u201d and \u201cdeliberative.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, Cantwell heralded a breakthrough privacy measure with House Energy\nand Commerce Committee Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), marking\nthe first time the leaders of the two critical committees had agreed on a plan\nto establish a federal baseline for what data companies can collect online and\nto give consumers new privacy rights. Lawmakers, privacy advocates and\nindustry leaders praised the deal, one of the most sought-after pieces of\ninternet policy in Washington.\n\nBut at least five aides said it was the type of agreement that could have been\nstruck years ago. And there\u2019s still skepticism about Cantwell\u2019s ability to\nclose out the process. \u201cExpectations are low,\u201d said one Senate aide.\n\nCantwell launched her first senatorial bid shortly after helping the streaming\nsoftware company RealNetworks weather a major privacy scandal.\n\nAdvocates revealed the tech firm\u2019s music player could secretly collect data on\nusers\u2019 listening habits. Cantwell, RealNetworks\u2019 former marketing chief, has\nsaid the incident influenced her thinking about the need for privacy\nprotections.\n\nOn her campaign website, privacy got near-top billing. \u201cThe government has an\nobligation to set the ethical and legal standards for the management of\npersonal data, and to enforce those standards,\u201d she wrote at the time.\n\nBut her role swelled much later, in 2019, when Cantwell became the senior\nDemocrat on Senate Commerce. Her ascension came as fury with Silicon Valley \u2014\npartly fueled by the 2018 Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal \u2014 was starting\nto generate legislative activity.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe European Union had implemented its own sprawling privacy protections,\nknown as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, as had California,\nand U.S. lawmakers pushed to follow suit.\n\nA bipartisan working group led by then-Commerce Chairman Roger Wicker\n(R-Miss.) was making steady headway toward a national bill to protect\nconsumers\u2019 personal information. When Cantwell and then-Senate Majority Whip\nJohn Thune (R-S.D.) joined the group, the expansion was touted as a sign of\ngrowing momentum.\n\nBut Cantwell undermined the negotiations, according to five current and former\nSenate aides, publicly questioning whether other group members were committed\nto producing a \u201cstrong bill\u201d and remaining \u201cnoncommittal\u201d and \u201csullen\u201d in\nprivate meetings with the members.\n\nThe discussions took a sharp turn a couple of months after the expansion, when\nCantwell pushed to narrow the negotiating pool to just herself and Wicker.\n\n\u201cNothing really happened after that,\u201d said one aide. Cantwell and Wicker\nrolled out separate privacy proposals later that year.\n\nThe two sides remained apart on key sticking points \u2014 whether a federal law\nshould override state privacy measures, as Republicans wanted, and whether\nconsumers should be able to sue companies directly, as Democrats desired. The\ndisputes have long befuddled negotiators.\n\nBut many aides said the episode was part of a pattern: Cantwell would publicly\ncriticize other members\u2019 tech initiatives, take umbrage at lawmakers leading\nthem in her stead, and then either let the push fizzle or quash it behind\nclosed doors.\n\n\u201cLegislation would be worked on for months, hours and hours and hours of staff\ntime would be invested, member conversations would be had, and then all of the\nsudden things would go in a completely different direction,\u201d said a former\nSenate aide.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a trend several aides said they fear will be repeated in other\nnegotiations, including over the fate of a recently passed House bill\ntargeting TikTok, the popular video-sharing app, which has been besieged by\nallegations that its China-based parent, ByteDance, poses a national security\nrisk.\n\nCantwell has said the Senate should consider the issue and had been drafting\nan alternative proposal to address the concerns around TikTok. But last month,\nshe poured cold water on the House bill, telling Politico, \u201cThat one, I don\u2019t\nthink will make it all the way through.\u201d\n\nCantwell and the other leaders of the Commerce and Intelligence committees\nhave agreed to amend the House legislation, but staffers have had difficulty\npinning down what updates she is seeking, according to a person with knowledge\nof the talks. When asked about it, Cantwell\u2019s office referred to a Politico\narticle published Thursday in which an unnamed Commerce aide said the senator\nis in talks with other lawmakers about changes to the bill.\n\nSome senators have called on Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer\n(D-N.Y.) to bypass Commerce \u2014 and Cantwell \u2014 by bringing the TikTok bill\nstraight to the Senate floor for a vote. Schumer has not commented on the\nidea.\n\nSome lawmakers and advocacy groups have argued that Congress would not need to\nworry so much about TikTok if it just passed a broader privacy law. But for\nyears, many bills aimed at grappling with the powerful tech sector have hinged\non the House and Senate commerce panels, where relationships have soured.\n\nIn 2022, Cantwell was notably absent from a deal struck by three of the four\nleaders of the committees on a landmark draft privacy proposal. Cantwell\npublicly torched the bill a few weeks later, arguing it had \u201cmajor enforcement\nholes\u201d and urging other lawmakers to \u201ccome back to the table on something\nstrong.\u201d\n\nBut weeks prior, Cantwell privately accused the group of cutting her out of\nthe discussions and then walked away from the negotiating table, according to\nmore than a half-dozen current and former Senate and House aides. Afterward,\nCantwell\u2019s office combatively declined to engage with lawmakers on their\nlegislation, several aides said.\n\nCantwell rebuked a provision in the bill delaying when consumers could bring\nlawsuits against companies and called for protections against forced\narbitration, an issue she also raised in 2019.\n\n\u201cShe wanted to do her own thing and couldn\u2019t be swayed to work\ncollaboratively,\u201d said a former House aide. Another aide said the dynamics\ncreated significant \u201cbad blood\u201d between Cantwell and her counterparts.\n\nOn Sunday, Cantwell said the \u201cfour corners\u201d group\u2019s effort \u201cdidn\u2019t go where it\nneeded to.\u201d Lacitis, her spokeswoman, said that at the time, Cantwell was also\nhelping lead efforts to pass \u201cone of the most consequential pieces of\nlegislation to reinvigorate American manufacturing\u201d in the semiconductor\nindustry.\n\nA spokesman for Wicker declined to comment. In a statement, top House Energy\nand Commerce Democrat Frank Pallone Jr. (N.J.) said: \u201cSenator Cantwell and I\nhave both passed legislation out of our committees that would finally begin to\nhold Big Tech accountable, but getting them across the finish line is\nchallenging. I\u2019m optimistic that we\u2019ll make meaningful progress together in\nthe months ahead.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, McMorris Rodgers said she was \u201cencouraged\u201d she and Cantwell were\nable to \u201chammer out language to address the sticking points and reach an\nagreement\u201d on a new bill.\n\nThe Washington Post first contacted Cantwell\u2019s office for an interview last\nmonth before lawmakers went on a two-week recess, during which The Post\ncontacted dozens of current and former aides. Plans for an interview were\ndelayed until Sunday. Two days before then, on April 5, Punchbowl News was the\nfirst to report on Cantwell\u2019s privacy deal.\n\nOn Sunday, Cantwell told The Post that McMorris Rodgers, another influential\nmember of Washington state\u2019s congressional delegation, approached her in\nDecember with an idea for breaking the logjam on privacy: \u201cMaybe a Northwest\nperspective could work here.\u201d\n\nCantwell\u2019s opposition was not the only hurdle for the 2022 privacy bill. Other\nSenate Democrats, including Richard Blumenthal (Conn.) and Brian Schatz\n(Hawaii), expressed concern that its enforcement and protections were lacking.\nMonths later, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) criticized the bill\nfor overriding protections in California.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe House bill was never brought to the floor.\n\nMultiple aides said Cantwell has often not given her staff enough license to\nspeak on her behalf, causing delays that threaten already tenuous momentum.\n\u201cThe staff aren\u2019t empowered enough to feel like they can be in a room and cut\nthe deals that need to be cut,\u201d said a former House aide.\n\nTurnover has also been an issue, aides said.\n\nCantwell was tied for the second-highest staff turnover rate of any current\nsenator between 2001 and 2022, behind only Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.),\naccording to data compiled by LegiStorm, a research organization that tracks\npersonnel changes on Capitol Hill. In 2019 and 2022, two key negotiating years\non privacy, Cantwell ranked third and 36th, respectively.\n\nCantwell has lost several top committee aides in recent years, some of whom\ndecamped for jobs at major tech companies including Meta. Other Cantwell\nstaffers have lobbied or consulted for TikTok.\n\nCantwell, who has served as Washington\u2019s junior senator since 2001, has long-\nstanding ties to tech leaders in and outside of Washington beyond her time at\nRealNetworks.\n\nStaffers from Microsoft and Amazon \u2014 both headquartered in her state \u2014 have\nbeen among Cantwell\u2019s biggest political contributors over the past five years,\naccording to OpenSecrets, an organization that tracks campaign donations.\n\nHer past tech and telecom donors have included Amazon Web Services CEO Adam\nSelipsky, Microsoft President Brad Smith, T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert and Amazon\nfounder Jeff Bezos, who owns The Washington Post, according to a review of\nfederal campaign disclosure forms.\n\nNone of the aides interviewed for this report presented any evidence of\npotential improper influence, instead largely attributing her disputes with\nother members on tech to a mix of personality clashes, political squabbling\nand policy differences.\n\nIn recent years, Senate Commerce has twice advanced a bill to expand federal\nprivacy laws for children and another sweeping measure led by Blumenthal and\nSen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) to force tech companies to take greater steps\nto protect children from harm. Both lawmakers expressed gratitude for\nCantwell\u2019s support in written statements.\n\nSen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), a member of the 2019 privacy working group, said\nCantwell has \u201cbeen helpful in including me in meetings and conversations.\u201d He\nadded: \u201cEverything takes a while around here.\u201d\n\nSchumer called Cantwell \u201cone of the most productive and effective members\u201d of\nthe chamber and said she is \u201cworking doggedly to achieve bipartisan results\u201d\non Commerce.\n\nBut some aides said her dizzying approach to negotiations isn\u2019t distinct to\ntech: The same dynamics that have rankled staffers have reared in other areas\nsuch as telecom and transportation policy.\n\nCantwell \u201chas been redefining transportation policy with investments in\nfreight, megaprojects, and fish passage,\u201d in addition to advancing aviation\nsafety legislation, Lacitis said.\n\nSeveral Senate aides criticized her for not holding more hearings on tech\nissues this Congress. Senate Commerce has held hearings on internet access,\nrobocalls and artificial intelligence. But it\u2019s been over two years since it\u2019s\nheld a session focused on privacy or social media regulation, major issues it\nhas primary jurisdiction over. Other panels, including Senate Judiciary and\nHouse Energy and Commerce, have been far more active.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nCantwell\u2019s landmark agreement with McMorris Rodgers on a draft proposal,\nhowever, has renewed hope a long-sought federal privacy law could once again\nbe within reach. Cantwell said that getting House GOP leaders to sign off on\nlanguage barring forced arbitration and removing the delay on when consumers\ncan bring lawsuits was key to reaching a compromise.\n\n\u201cIt just takes a while for these issues on how to protect those rights to be\nspecified,\u201d Cantwell said. She called the new bill stronger and \u201cnight and\nday\u201d from the House proposal in 2022.\n\nAsked what it would mean to her personally to finally pass federal privacy\nstandards after years of unsuccessful attempts, Cantwell demurred: \u201cIt\u2019s hard\nto comprehend. It\u2019s kind of hard to comprehend ... so I\u2019ll just leave it at\nthat.\u201d\n\nwashingtonpost.com \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n\n  * washingtonpost.com\n  * \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n\n", "frontpage": true}
