Bahlmann of VU\nUniversity Amsterdam sheds light on this intriguing question, revealing that\nthe physical attractiveness of male entrepreneurs and venture capitalists\nsignificantly impacts financial decision-making in the high-stakes world of\nventure capital investment. This research uncovers the subtle yet powerful\ninfluence of looks in determining the flow of millions of euros within the\nEuropean Information Technology (IT) industry.\n\nThe study was published in Frontiers in Psychology.\n\nBahlmann embarked on this research journey to explore the evolutionary\nunderpinnings of risk-taking behaviors, particularly in the context of\ninnovation and venture capital funding. \u201cRecently, I\u2019ve become fascinated by\nevolutionary psychology in general, and how embodied qualities affect our\nbehavior, perspectives, and risk-taking in particular. I\u2019m particularly\ninterested in the evolutionary nature of our risk-taking behaviors in\ninnovation decision-making contexts,\u201d explained Bahlmann, an assistant\nprofessor of management and organization.\n\nPrior studies have documented the effects of opposite-sex stimuli on behaviors\nsuch as financial risk-taking and decision-making. However, the realm of same-\nsex stimuli, especially among males, remained less explored, particularly in\nreal-world settings.\n\nBahlmann aimed to bridge this gap, focusing on the venture capital sector\u2014a\nfield where high-growth potential ventures attract substantial financial risks\nand where decisions have traditionally been attributed to rational analysis.\nYet, evidence suggests that these decisions are also susceptible to the\n\u2018attractiveness halo effect,\u2019 where good looks are often subconsciously\nassociated with positive traits such as intelligence or trustworthiness.\n\nTo conduct this research, Bahlmann compiled a dataset of 341 male-led European\nIT ventures by leveraging information from AngelList and Crunchbase,\ncomplemented by LinkedIn profiles to ensure a comprehensive understanding of\nthe ventures, their entrepreneurial teams, and associated investors. The focus\nwas specifically on ventures with male entrepreneur-investor dyads that\nprovided clear information on entrepreneurial team composition and funding\nprocesses across these platforms, ensuring the data\u2019s reliability and\nrelevance.\n\nPhysical attractiveness was assessed by having ten graduate students rate\nLinkedIn profile photos of the entrepreneurs and investors. The study measured\nventure capitalists\u2019 financial risk-taking by examining the amounts invested\nin the first and second funding rounds of the startups. Various control\nvariables, such as venture age, team size, and market orientation, were\nincluded to ensure the accuracy of the findings.\n\nBahlmann found evidence that the physical attractiveness of both entrepreneurs\nand venture capitalists played a significant role in the initial funding\nrounds.\n\nVenture capitalists of average or below-average attractiveness were more\ninclined to invest higher amounts in startups led by attractive entrepreneurs\nduring the first funding round. This suggests that perceptions of physical\nattractiveness can sway investment decisions, potentially as venture\ncapitalists seek to align themselves with entrepreneurs who exhibit desirable\ntraits symbolized by their attractiveness.\n\nThis effect, however, did not hold for venture capitalists considered above\naverage in attractiveness, who showed a more consistent risk-taking behavior\nirrespective of the entrepreneur\u2019s looks.\n\nThe findings indicate that \u201can entrepreneur\u2019s physical attractiveness acts as\na subconscious cue for a venture capitalists investment decisions, but that\nthe way in which this occurs is dependent on a venture capitalist\u2019s own\nphysical attractiveness,\u201d Bahlmann told PsyPost. \u201cThis implies that\nevolutionary, upward social comparison effects that originally serve to\ninspire a male\u2019s mating strategies, also generalize to the context of\nfinancial risk-taking.\u201d\n\nAs the funding process progressed to the second round, the Bahlmann observed a\nchange in how the physical attractiveness of entrepreneurs influenced\ninvestment decisions. For venture capitalists of below-average attractiveness,\nthe attractiveness of entrepreneurs had a negative relationship with second-\nround risk-taking.\n\nThis shift might be indicative of a \u201cbeauty penalty\u201d effect, where initial\npositive biases based on attractiveness could reverse if the entrepreneurs do\nnot meet the high expectations set by their physical appearance.\nAlternatively, it suggests a complex interplay where the initial\nattractiveness-driven biases wane as more substantive venture performance data\nbecome available, altering the risk assessment landscape.\n\n\u201cI was somewhat surprised by the notion that the positive effect of\nentrepreneur\u2019s physical attractiveness on venture capitalist risk-taking\nturned negative during the second round of risk-taking, but only for venture\ncapitalists of below-average attractiveness,\u201d Bahlmann said. \u201cThis effect was\nnot established for venture capitalists of average or above-average\nattractiveness.\u201d\n\nWhile Bahlmann\u2019s study offers important insights into the role of physical\nattractiveness in venture capital decision-making, it also has some\nlimitations. One of the study\u2019s constraints is its reliance on archival and\nobservational data, which did not include information on individual\npsychological dispositions that could influence financial risk-taking.\n\n\u201cThe research is based on correlational data,\u201d Bahlmann noted. \u201cThis means we\nneed to be cautious with causality claims, even though several statistical\ntechniques were used to create more robust cause-effect relationships.\u201d\n\nFuture research could explore the impact of same-sex attractiveness in other\nindustries or contexts, examine the long-term effects of physical\nattractiveness on venture success, and investigate how other personal\nattributes interact with physical appearance to influence professional and\nfinancial decisions. There\u2019s also a growing need to understand how these\nfindings apply to female entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, as the\nrepresentation of women in the tech industry and venture capital continues to\nincrease.\n\n\u201cIn the end, I hope to better understand the evolutionary mechanisms in\ninnovation decision-making contexts,\u201d Bahlmann said. \u201cThis ranges from venture\ncapitalists\u2019 investment decisions in startups to CEOs\u2019 and TMTs\u2019 decision-\nmaking on which new technological trajectories to follow.\u201d\n\nThe study, \u201cPhysical attractiveness, same-sex stimuli, and male venture\ncapitalists\u2019 financial risk-taking,\u201d was published January 11, 2024.\n\nTweetSendScanShareSendPin1ShareShareShare\n\n### RELATED\n\nAttractiveness\n\n### Physically attractive attorneys tend to have greater success in federal\ncourt\n\nApril 10, 2024\n\nNew research finds that attractive attorneys are more likely to win cases,\nsuggesting an unconscious bias in judicial decisions.
