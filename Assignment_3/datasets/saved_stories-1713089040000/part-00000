Google's Android phone and\nWindows Phone 7 mobile browsers and operating systems will support Flash. Even\nApple's Safari 5 will be HTML5 compliant, but their mobile browser, found on\nthe iPhone, iPod, and iPad products, will not support Flash.\n\nHowever, YouTube has noted some concerns with the HTML5 video tag as a\nreplacement for the traditional Flash Player. First, not all browsers have\nagreed on a codec standard, and with users uploading 24 hours worth of video\nevery minute to YouTube, it's important that they support the minimal amount\nof available codecs.\n\nCurrently Google, Opera, and Mozilla are supporting WebM VP8, which would\nhighly benefit the HTML5 video codec. VP8 is an open-sourced video streaming\nmedia project by Google which operates under a BSD-style royalty-free license.\nMicrosoft and Apple will be sticking with the H.264 standard, but Microsoft\nsaid Internet Explorer 9 will also allow users to install WebM if they wish.\n\nUntil all the browsers can agree on a video encoding format, YouTube said it\nwill still stick with H.264, which it has been using since 2007.\n\nHTML5 also has problems performing robust video streaming, and when streaming\nlive videos, it's important to have full control over buffering and video\nquality controls. DRM-protection is also important to YouTube, so they can\noffer services like YouTube Rentals, which requires making sure videos are not\ncopied and redistributed around the web without the owners consent.\n\nIf anyone has actually tried using the HTML5 player, there is a significant\ndifference between the Flash version of the site and the HTML5 player. One\nnoticeable difference between the two players is the delay when selecting a\ncertain part of a video. The HTML5 video seems to have a 1-2 second delay,\nwile the Flash player is almost instant.\n\nOn the comparison below is the HTML5 player (left) and the Flash version of\nthe player (right), running on Chrome 6.0.447.0 running Flash 10.1.53.64, on a\nWindows 7 x64 Ultimate edition installation. There is a significant difference\nin terms of loading time and video quality, both of which Flash has the\nadvantage.\n\nAnother important feature for YouTube is embedding videos on external\nwebsites. Although HTML5 allows for sandboxing and message-passing functions\nfor things like captions, annotations and advertising, Flash is still the tool\nmost sites use for embedded content.\n\nLastly, HTML5 does not support webcam and microphone access. Thousands of\nvideos are uploaded daily using YouTube's built-in video recording software\nthat uses the users webcam and microphone to record, something that would be\nimpossible to do without Flash.\n\nAs HTML5 is still in development and definitely still requires a lot more\nwork, it may be some time yet before users and major websites ditch Flash for\nHTML5.\n\n#### Tags\n\n  * Youtube\n  * Google\n  * Html5\n  * Flash\n  * Editorial\n\nLike\n\nPost\n\nShare\n\nReport a problem with article\n\nNext Article\n\n### Everyone's favourite fruit might be coming to a living room near you\n\nPrevious Article\n\n### Dell denies that they lied to consumers over faulty parts\n\n### Related Stories\n\n### Google reportedly let OpenAI transcribe a million hours of YouTube videos\nto train GPT-4\n\nSagar Naresh \u00b7 Apr 7, 2024 with 2 comment s\n\n### Google Podcasts bids adieu, users urged to shift over to YouTube Music\n\nSagar Naresh \u00b7 Apr 4, 2024 with 1 comment\n\n### Report: Playables mobile games inside the YouTube app are going away soon\n\nAditya Tiwari \u00b7 Mar 26, 2024 with 1 comment\n\n### Google is requiring YouTube creators to post labels for realistic AI-\ncreated content\n\nJohn Callaham \u00b7 Mar 18, 2024 with 1 comment\n\nFrom the WebPowered by ZergNet\n\nThe Tragedy Of Markiplier Is Just Depressing\n\nIf Hitler Had Won WW2, These Were His Plans For The US\n\nWe Might Know Where Human Teeth Came From & We Can't Sleep Now\n\nNever, Ever Kill A Spider In Your House.
