And even though\nwe\u2019re in rural southeastern Montana, more than 800 miles from the Pacific\nOcean, West Coast cities are largely to blame for the destruction of this\nlandscape.\n\nWorkers at the Rosebud Mine load coal onto a conveyor belt, which carries the\nplanet-wrecking fuel to a power plant in the small town next door. Plant\noperators in Colstrip burn the coal to produce electricity, much of which is\nshipped by power line to homes and businesses in the Portland and Seattle\nareas. It\u2019s been that way for decades.\n\n\u201cThe West Coast markets are what created this,\u201d Anne Hedges says, as we watch\na dragline move dirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn aerial view of the coal mine outside Colstrip that feeds the town\u2019s power\nplant.\n\n(Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times)\n\nShe sounds frustrated, and with good reason.\n\nHedges and her fellow Montana environmentalists were happy when Oregon and\nWashington passed laws requiring 100% clean energy in the next two decades.\nBut they\u2019re furious that electric utilities in those states are planning to\nstick with coal for as long as the laws allow, and in some cases making deals\nto give away their Colstrip shares to co-owners who seem determined to keep\nthe plant running long into the future.\n\n\u201cCoal is not dead yet,\u201d Hedges says. \u201cIt\u2019s still alive and well.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s an uncomfortable reality for West Coasters critical of red-state\nenvironmental policies but not in the habit of urging their politicians to\nwork across state lines to change them \u2014 especially when doing so might\ninvolve compromise with Republicans.\n\nOne example: California lawmakers have refused to pass bills that would make\nit easier to share clean electricity across the West, passing up the chance to\nspur renewable energy development in windy red states such as Montana and\nWyoming \u2014 and to show them it\u2019s possible to create construction jobs and tax\nrevenues with renewable energy, not just fossil fuels.\n\nInstead, California has prioritized in-state wind and solar farms, bowing to\nthe will of labor unions that want those jobs.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to blame Golden State politicians, and voters, for taking the easy\npath.\n\nBut global warming is a global problem \u2014 and whether we like it or not, the\nelectric grid is a giant, interconnected machine. Coal plants in conservative\nstates help fuel the ever-deadlier heat waves, fires and storms battering\nCalifornia and other progressive bastions. The electrons generated by those\nplants flow into a network of wires that keep the lights on across the\nAmerican West.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso important: Montana and other sparsely populated conservative states\ncontrol two U.S. Senate seats each, and at least three electoral votes apiece\nin presidential elections. Additional federal support for clean energy rests\npartly in their hands.\n\nThose are the practical considerations. Then there are the ethical ones.\n\nFor years, the West\u2019s biggest cities exported their emissions, building\ndistant coal generators to fuel their explosive growth. Los Angeles looked to\nDelta, Utah. Phoenix turned to the Navajo Nation. Albuquerque turned to the\nFour Corners region.\n\nThat wave of coal plants \u2014 some still standing, some demolished \u2014 created\nwell-paying jobs, lots of tax payments and a thriving way of life for rural\ntowns and Native American tribes. All are now struggling to map out a future\nwithout fossil fuels.\n\nMule deer roam through the town of Colstrip, not far from the power plant.\n\n(Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times)\n\nWhat do big cities owe those towns and tribes for producing our power and\nliving with our air and water pollution? Can we get climate change under\ncontrol without putting them out of business? What\u2019s their role in the clean\nenergy transition?\n\nIf they refuse to join the transition, how should we respond?\n\nA team of Los Angeles Times journalists spent a week in Montana trying to\nanswer those questions.\n\nWe explored the town of Colstrip, hearing from residents about how the coal\nplant and mine have made their prosperous lives possible. We talked with\nenvironmental activists who detailed the damage coal has caused, and with a\nfourth-generation rancher whose father fought in vain to stop the power plant\nfrom getting built \u2014 and wrote poems about his struggle.\n\nCoal is going to die, sooner or later. For the sake of myself and other young\npeople, I hope it\u2019s sooner.\n\nAnd for the sake of places like Colstrip, I hope it\u2019s the beginning of a new\nchapter, not the end of the story.\n\n## Coal pays the bills. For now\n\nFor a community of 2,000 people, Colstrip doesn\u2019t lack for nice things.\n\nThe city is home to 32 public parks and a gorgeous community center, complete\nwith child care, gym, spin classes, tanning booth and water slide. The\nspacious health clinic employs three nurses and two physical therapists, with\na doctor coming to visit once a week. There\u2019s an artificial lake filled with\nYellowstone River water and circled by a three-mile walking and biking trail.\n\nEverybody knows where the good fortune comes from.\n\nThe high school pays homage to the source of Colstrip\u2019s wealth with the\nhashtag #MTCOAL emblazoned on the basketball court\u2019s sparkling floor. A sign\nover the entrance to campus celebrates the town\u2019s 2023 centennial: \u201c100 Years\nof Colstrip. Powered by Coal, Strengthened by People.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have nothing to hide,\u201d Jim Atchison tells me. \u201cWe just hope that you give\nus a fair shake.\u201d\n\nJim Atchison steps out of his office in Colstrip.\n\n(Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times)\n\nI couldn\u2019t have asked for a better tour guide than Atchison, who for 22 years\nhas lived in Colstrip and led the Southeast Montana Economic Development Corp.\nHe\u2019s soft-spoken and meticulous, with a detailed itinerary for our day and a\nless ironclad allegiance to coal than many of the locals we\u2019ll meet.\n\nThey include Bill Neumiller, a former environmental engineer at the power\nplant. We start our day with him, watching the sun rise over the smokestacks\nacross the lake. He moved to Colstrip 40 years ago, when the coal plant was\nbeing built. He enjoys fishing in the well-stocked lake and teaching kids\nabout its history, in his role as president of the parks district.\n\nThe plant, he says, pays the vast majority of the city\u2019s property taxes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a great place to raise a family,\u201d he says.\n\nSo many people have similar stories \u2014 the general manager of a local\nelectrical contractor, the administrator of the health clinic. I especially\nenjoy chatting with Amber and Gary Ramsey, who have run a Subway sandwich shop\nhere for 30 years.\n\n\u201cIt takes us two to three hours to get through the grocery store, because you\nknow everybody,\u201d Gary says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe didn\u2019t plan to spend his life here. Sitting at a table at Subway, he tells\nus he grew up in South Dakota and went to college in North Dakota before\ntaking a job teaching math and coaching wrestling in Colstrip. He planned to\nstay for a year or two.\n\nThen he met Amber, who was working part-time as a bartender and doing payroll\nat the coal plant.\n\n\u201cForty years later, I\u2019m still here,\u201d he says. \u201cWe raised our kids here.\u201d\n\nThe power plant\u2019s smokestacks are visible from miles away in the town of\nColstrip.\n\n(Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times)\n\nJohn Williams was one of the first Montana Power Co. employees to move to\nColstrip, as planning for the plant\u2019s construction got started. Today he\u2019s the\nmayor. He\u2019s well-versed in local history, from the first coal mining in the\n1920s \u2014 which supplied railroads that later switched to diesel \u2014 to the\neconomic revitalization when the Portland and Seattle areas came calling.\n\nUnlike many of the other Colstrip lifers who share their stories, several of\nWilliams\u2019 kids have left town. But one of his sons lives in a part of\nWashington where some of the electricity comes from Colstrip. Same for another\nson who lives in Idaho.\n\nIt\u2019s hard for Williams to imagine a viable future for his home without the\npower plant.\n\n\u201cI believe they are intimately tied together,\u201d he says.\n\nAnd what about climate change, I ask?\n\nNearly everyone in Colstrip has a version of the same answer: Even if it\u2019s\nreal, it\u2019s not nearly as bad as liberals claim. And without coal power,\nblackouts will reign. West Coast city-dwellers don\u2019t understand how badly they\nneed us here in Montana.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAtchison is an exception.\n\nYes, he\u2019s dubious about climate science. And yes, he wants to save the mine\nand power plant. His office is plastered with pro-coal messages \u2014 a sign that\nsays, \u201cCoal Pays the Bills,\u201d a magnet reading, \u201cProve you\u2019re against coal\nmining: Turn off your electricity.\u201d\n\nBut he knows the market for coal is shrinking as the nation\u2019s most populous\ncities and most profitable companies increasingly demand climate-friendly\nenergy. So he\u2019s preparing for a future in which Colstrip has no choice but to\nstart providing it.\n\n\u201cWe have one horse in the barn now,\u201d Atchison says. \u201cWe need to add two or\nthree more horses to the barn.\u201d\n\nA conveyor belts carries coal from the Rosebud Mine to the Colstrip power\nplant.\n\n(Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times)\n\nEver since President Obama started trying to tighten regulations on coal\npower, Atchison has been developing and implementing an economic\ndiversification strategy for Colstrip. It involves expanding broadband\ncapacity, building a business innovation center and broadening the local\nenergy economy beyond coal. The transmission lines connecting Colstrip with\nthe Pacific Northwest are an especially valuable asset, capable of sending\nhuge amounts of clean electricity to the Pacific coast.\n\n\u201cColstrip is evolving from a coal community into an energy community,\u201d\nAtchison says. \u201cWe\u2019re changing. We\u2019re not closing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlready, Montana\u2019s biggest wind farm is shipping electricity west via the\nColstrip lines. A Houston company is planning another power line that would\nrun from Colstrip to North Dakota. Federal researchers are studying whether\nColstrip\u2019s coal units could be replaced with advanced nuclear reactors, or\nwith a gas-fired power plant capable of capturing and storing its climate\npollution.\n\nWest Coast voters and politicians could speed up the evolution, for Colstrip\nand other coal towns. Instead of just congratulating themselves for getting\nout of coal, they could fund training programs and invest in clean energy\nprojects in those towns.\n\nThey\u2019ll never fully replace the ample jobs, salaries and tax revenues\ncurrently provided by coal. But nothing lasts forever. One hundred years is a\npretty good run.\n\n## Some inconvenient truths\n\n\u201cGreat God, how we\u2019re doin\u2019! We\u2019re rolling in dough, As they tear and they\nravage The Earth. And nobody knows...or nobody cares... About things of\nintrinsic worth.\u201d\n\n\u2014Wally McRae, \u201cThings of Intrinsic Worth\u201d (1989)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrowing up outside Colstrip in the 1970s could lead to strange moments for\nClint McRae, the son of a cowboy poet.\n\nHe was a teenager then, and Montana Power Co. was working to build public\nsupport for Units 3 and 4 of the coal plant. One day his eighth-grade teacher\ninstructed everyone who supported the new coal-fired generators to stand on\none side of the classroom. Everyone opposed should stand on the other side.\n\nMcRae was the only student opposed.\n\n\u201cAnd then [the teacher] gave a lecture about how important the construction of\nthese plants was and handed out bumper stickers that said, \u2018Support Colstrip\nUnits 3 and 4,\u2019\u201d McRae tells me, shaking his head. \u201cIt was terribly\nuncomfortable.\u201d\n\nRancher Clint McRae was raised outside Colstrip and has followed in his\nfather\u2019s footsteps.\n\n(Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times)\n\nLater, his mom was doing laundry and found a pro-coal bumper sticker in his\npants pocket. She showed it to his cattle rancher father, Wally, \u201cand I guess\nhe went over there [to the school] and kicked ass and took names,\u201d McRae says\nwith a laugh.\n\nFifty years later, he\u2019s carrying on his dad\u2019s legacy.\n\nWe spend a morning in the Colstrip area on McRae\u2019s sprawling ranch, admiring\nsandstone rock formations and herds of black angus cows. The scenery is harsh\nbut elegant, rolling hills and pale green grasses and pink-streaked horizon\nlines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis country has a sharp edge to it,\u201d McRae says, quoting a photographer who\nvisited the property years ago.\n\nThe land has been in his family since the 1880s, when his great-grandfather\nimmigrated from Scotland. He hopes his youngest daughter \u2014 who recently moved\nback home with her husband \u2014 will be the fifth generation to raise cattle\nhere.\n\n\u201cAnd we just had a grandchild seven months ago, and she\u2019s the sixth,\u201d he says.\n\nRancher Clint McRae contemplates the environmental threats facing his family\u2019s\nland.\n\n(Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times)\n\nMcRae wears a cowboy hat and drives a pickup truck. He tells me right away\nthat he\u2019s \u201cnot the kind of person who participates in government programs\nunless I absolutely have to.\u201d He\u2019s certainly got no qualms about making a\nliving selling beef.\n\nBut McRae and his forebears defy stereotypes.\n\nHis father, Wally, not only raised cows but was also a celebrated poet,\nappointed by President Clinton to the National Council on the Arts. In the\n1970s, he joined with other ranchers to help found Northern Plains Resource\nCouncil, an advocacy group. They were moved to act by a utility industry plan\nfor nearly two dozen coal plants between Colstrip and Gillette, Wyo.\n\n\u201cI and others like me will not allow our land to be destroyed merely because\nit is convenient for the coal company to tear it up,\u201d Wally McRae said, as\nquoted in a 50th-anniversary book published by Northern Plains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow in his late 80s and retired from the ranch, Wally\u2019s got every reason to be\nproud of his son.\n\nClint has fought to limit pollution from the coal plant his dad couldn\u2019t stop\n\u2014 and to ensure the cleanup of dangerous chemicals already emitted by the\nplant and mine. He\u2019s written articles calling for stronger regulation of coal\nwaste, and slamming laws that critics say would let coal companies pollute\nwater with impunity. Like his father, he\u2019s a member of Northern Plains.\n\nMcRae wants me to know that even though he and his dad \u201cdamn sure have a\ndifference of opinion\u201d with many of the people who live in town, \u201cit was never\npersonal.\u201d The coal-plant employees are friends of his. He doesn\u2019t want them\nto lose their jobs.\n\n\u201cOur kids went to school together, played sports together,\u201d he says.\n\nRancher Clint McRae opens a gate on his family\u2019s land outside Colstrip.\n\n(Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times)\n\nBut even though McRae believes \u201cwe can have it both ways\u201d \u2014 coal generation\ncoupled with environmental protection \u2014 he\u2019s not optimistic. And history\nsuggests he\u2019s right to be skeptical. Various analyses have found rampant\ngroundwater contamination from coal plants, including Colstrip. Air pollution\nis another deadly concern. A peer-reviewed study last year estimated that\nfine-particle emissions from coal plants killed 460,000 Americans between 1999\nand 2020.\n\nThen there\u2019s the climate crisis.\n\nMcRae doesn\u2019t want to talk about global warming \u2014 \u201cthat\u2019s not my bag,\u201d he\nsays. But he\u2019s seen firsthand what it can look like.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn August 2021, the Richard Spring fire tore across 171,000 acres, devastating\nmuch of his ranch and nearly torching both of his family\u2019s houses. He was on\nthe front lines of the fast-moving blaze as part of the local volunteer\nfirefighting crew. Temperatures topped 100 degrees, adding to the strain of\ndry conditions and fierce winds. McRae had never seen anything like it.\n\nTwo and a half years later, he\u2019s still building back up his cattle numbers and\nletting the grass regrow.\n\n\u201cIt burned all of our hay. It was awful,\u201d he says.\n\nMcRae has a strong sense of history. As we drive toward the Tongue River,\nwhich forms a boundary of his ranch, he points out where members of the\nArapaho, Lakota Sioux and Northern Cheyenne tribes camped before the Battle of\nthe Little Bighorn in 1876, a few years ahead of his great-grandfather\u2019s\narrival in Montana. A few minutes later he stops to show off a series of tipi\nrings \u2014 artifacts of Indigenous life that he\u2019s promised local tribes he\u2019ll\nprotect.\n\nMcRae is acutely aware that this wasn\u2019t always ranchland \u2014 and that it\nprobably won\u2019t be forever.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna change,\u201d he says. \u201cWhether we embrace it or not.\u201d\n\n## The wind and the water\n\nSturgeon. Bubbles. Salamander. Jimmy Neutron.\n\nThose are \u201ccall signs\u201d for some of the 13 employees at the Clearwater wind\nfarm, where 131 turbines are spread across 94 square miles of Montana\nranchland a few hours north of Colstrip. The nicknames are scrawled on a\nwhiteboard in the trailer office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRaptor. Goose. Sandman.\n\nClearly, they have fun here. And it\u2019s an industry where you can make good\nmoney.\n\nTurbines spin at sundown at NextEra Energy\u2019s Clearwater wind farm, which sends\npower from Montana to Oregon and Washington.\n\n(Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times)\n\nClearwater\u2019s operator, Florida-based NextEra Energy, won\u2019t disclose a salary\nrange. But as of 2022, the median annual wage for a U.S. wind turbine\ntechnician working in electric power was $59,890, compared with $46,310 for\nall occupations nationally.\n\n\u201cIf someone wants to stay close to home and still have a good career, we\nprovide them that opportunity,\u201d Alex Vineyard says.\n\nVineyard lives in nearby Miles City and manages Clearwater for NextEra,\nAmerica\u2019s largest renewable energy company. Clad in a hard hat, sweater vest\nand orange work gloves, he drives to a nearby turbine and walks up a staircase\nto show us the machinery inside. The tower is 374 feet high, meaning the tips\nof the blades reach 582 feet into the air.\n\nNot far from here, hundreds of construction laborers are finishing the next\ntwo phases of the Clearwater project.\n\nAlex Vineyard manages the Clearwater wind farm for NextEra, America\u2019s largest\nrenewable energy company.\n\n(Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times)\n\n\u201cYou can see where we build wind sites. It\u2019s not downtown L.A.,\u201d Vineyard\nsays, the sunset casting a brilliant orange glow behind him. \u201cGenerally it\u2019s\nrural areas \u2014 and there are limited opportunities for kids in those areas. Not\na lot of great careers.\u201d\n\nWind will never replace coal. The construction jobs are temporary, the\npermanent jobs far fewer.\n\nBut they\u2019re better than nothing. A lot better.\n\nAs much as West Coast megacities owe it to coal towns like Colstrip to bring\nthem along for the clean energy ride, coal towns like Colstrip owe it to\nthemselves to take what they can get \u2014 and not let stubbornness or politics\ncondemn them to oblivion.\n\nFortunately, they\u2019ve got the power grid on their side.\n\nIn today\u2019s highly regulated, thoroughly litigated world, long-distance power\nlines are incredibly hard to build. They can take years if not decades to\nsecure all the necessary approvals \u2014 if they can get those approvals at all.\nAs a result, wind and solar developers prize existing transmission lines, like\nthose built to carry power from Colstrip and other coal plants to big cities.\n\nThe Clearwater wind farm offers a telling case study.\n\nTwo of Colstrip\u2019s four coal units shut down in 2020 due to poor economics,\nopening up precious space on the plant\u2019s power lines. That open space made it\neasier for NextEra to sign contracts to sell hundreds of megawatts of wind\npower to two of Colstrip\u2019s co-owners, Portland General Electric and Puget\nSound Energy \u2014 and thus get Clearwater built.\n\nAn electrical substation flanks the Colstrip power plant.\n\n(Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMontana wind is especially useful for Oregon and Washington because it blows\nstrongest during winter, when those states need lots of energy to stay warm.\nOn that front, Clearwater has been a huge success. During its first winter, it\nhad a capacity factor of 60%, meaning it produced 60% of all the power it\ncould possibly produce, if there were enough wind 24/7.\n\nSixty percent is a lot \u2014 \u201clike a home run,\u201d Puget Sound Energy executive Ron\nRoberts says.\n\nHe and his colleagues want more. Puget Sound plans to build more Montana wind\nturbines to serve its Washington customers \u2014 again taking advantage of the\nColstrip power lines.\n\nWest Coast states need to keep investing in exactly this type of project if\nthey hope to persuade their conservative neighbors to stop fighting to save\ncoal. The more they can bring the benefits of wind and solar power to the rest\nof the West, the better.\n\nAnd what about those low-wind, cloudy days when wind turbines and solar panels\naren\u2019t enough to avoid blackouts?\n\nCarl Borgquist has a plan for that.\n\nI meet up with him near Gordon Butte \u2014 a flat-topped landmass that juts up\n1,025 feet from the floor of Montana\u2019s Musselshell River valley, four hours\nwest of Colstrip but just over five miles from the coal plant\u2019s power lines.\nThere are already wind turbines atop the butte, built by the landowning Galt\nfamily with Borgquist\u2019s help.\n\nBorgquist assures me as we drive to the top that I\u2019ll soon understand why this\nsteep butte is perfect for energy storage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt will intuitively make sense, the elegance and simplicity of gravity as a\nstorage medium,\u201d he says.\n\nCarl Borgquist admires the views from atop Gordon Butte, where he\u2019s got plans\nfor a pumped storage project to augment Montana wind power.\n\n(Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times)\n\nThere will be two reservoirs \u2014 one up on the butte, another 1,000 feet below.\nThey\u2019ll be filled with water from a nearby creek.\n\nDuring times of day when there\u2019s extra power on the Western electric grid \u2014\nmaybe temperatures are moderate in Portland and Seattle, but Montana winds are\nblowing strong \u2014 the Gordon Butte project will use that extra juice to pump\nwater uphill, from the lower reservoir to the upper reservoir. During times of\nday when the grid needs more power \u2014 maybe there\u2019s a record heat wave, and not\nenough wind to go around \u2014 Gordon Butte will let water flow downhill,\ngenerating electricity.\n\nIt\u2019s called pumped storage, and it\u2019s not a new concept. But compared with\nother proposals across the parched West, this one is almost miraculously\nnoncontroversial. No environmentalists making hay over water use. No nearby\nresidents crying foul.\n\nBorgquist still needs to sign up a utility customer, or he would have already\nflipped Gordon Butte to a developer better suited to build the $1.5-billion\nproject, which will employ 300 to 500 people during construction. But\nBorgquist is confident that before too long, one or two of the Pacific\nNorthwest electric utilities preparing to ditch Colstrip will see the light.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for the market to catch up to me,\u201d he says.\n\nLet\u2019s hope it catches up soon. Because even though pumped storage won\u2019t keep\nus heated and cooled and well-lit every hour of every day, neither will wind,\nor solar, or batteries, or anything else. No one technology will solve all our\nclimate problems.\n\nThe sooner we learn that lesson, the sooner we can move on to the hard part.\n\nThe Colstrip power lines run near Gordon Butte, carrying coal-fired\nelectricity \u2014 and increasingly wind energy \u2014 from Montana to Oregon and\nWashington.\n\n(Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times)\n\n## The art of the deal\n\nI find myself wandering the halls of the state Capitol in Helena. Christmas is\na few weeks away, and there\u2019s a spectacular tree beneath the massive dome,\nflanked by murals of white settlers and Indigenous Americans.\n\nOn a whim, I step into Gov. Greg Gianforte\u2019s office and ask if he\u2019s in.\nGianforte has fought to keep the Colstrip plant open, and I want to ask him\nabout it. I\u2019m also curious to meet a man who easily won election despite\nhaving assaulted a journalist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of his representatives takes down my contact info. I never get an\ninterview.\n\nDespite the state\u2019s deep-red turn in recent years, Montanans have a history of\nenvironmental consciousness, owing to their love of fishing, hunting and the\ngreat outdoors (as seen in the film \u201cA River Runs Through It\u201d). They approved\na new state constitution in 1972 that enshrined the right to a \u201cclean and\nhealthful environment in Montana for present and future generations.\u201d\n\nTo the frustration of Gianforte and his supporters, that right may include a\nstable climate.\n\nThis time last year, a Montana judge revoked the permit for a gas-fired power\nplant being built by the state\u2019s largest electric utility, NorthWestern\nEnergy, along the banks of the Yellowstone River. The judge ruled that the\nstate agency charged with approving the gas plant had failed to consider how\nthe facility\u2019s heat-trapping carbon emissions would contribute to the climate\ncrisis.\n\nNorthWestern Energy says this gas-fired power plant on the Yellowstone River\nis needed to help keep the lights on for homes and businesses.\n\n(Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times)\n\nLegislators responded by rushing to pass a law that barred state agencies from\nconsidering climate impacts.\n\nThe Yellowstone River gas plant moved forward, but the law didn\u2019t last long. A\nfew months after it passed, another judge ruled in favor of 16 young people\nsuing the state over global warming, agreeing that the legislation violated\ntheir constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is such a solvable problem,\u201d says Hedges, the Montana environmentalist\ncritical of coal mining. \u201cIt\u2019s just that nobody wants to solve it.\u201d\n\nHedges is a leader of the Montana Environmental Information Center, where\nshe\u2019s spent three decades battling for clean air, clean water and a healthy\nclimate. It was her advocacy group, along with the Sierra Club, that sued\nMontana over the state\u2019s approval of the Yellowstone River gas plant, setting\noff the chain of increasingly consequential court rulings.\n\nBut as mad as she is at Gianforte \u2014 and at the local utility company\nexecutives who insist they need coal to keep the lights on in Montana \u2014 Hedges\nis at her most caustic when discussing the Pacific Northwest environmentalists\nwho, in her view, have failed to do everything they can to get the Colstrip\npower plant shut down.\n\nThat includes the Sierra Club, which, Hedges says, has shifted its focus too\nquickly from shutting down coal plants to blocking the construction of new gas\nplants \u2014 even in places such as Montana, where coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel,\nisn\u2019t dead yet.\n\nHedges\u2019 frustration also includes the Washington state lawmakers who passed a\nmuch-lauded bill, signed by Gov. Jay Inslee, requiring electric utilities to\nstop buying coal power by 2025 \u2014 only to sit idly by as some of those\nutilities then made arrangements to give away their shares in the Colstrip\nplant to coal-friendly co-owners rather than negotiate agreements to shut the\ncoal units.\n\n\u201cSo they\u2019re not actually decreasing carbon dioxide emissions even a little\ntiny bit. They are allowing this plant to continue, instead of using their\nvote to close this source of pollution. It\u2019s maddening,\u201d Hedges says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n1\\. A lone tumbleweed blows through piles of coal at the Rosebud Mine outside\nColstrip, a few miles from the power plant. 2. Coal is prepped for transport\nat the mine. 3. Coal is transferred to a truck at the mine. (Robert Gauthier /\nLos Angeles Times)\n\nWashington officials say they tried to get Colstrip shut down but were stymied\nby the plant\u2019s complicated six-company ownership structure, and by the Montana\nLegislature\u2019s staunch support for coal. Sierra Club activists, meanwhile, say\nthey\u2019re still pushing for Colstrip\u2019s closure, and for coal shutdowns across\nthe country \u2014 even as they also oppose the construction of gas plants.\n\n\u201cFrom a climate perspective, gas is just as bad as coal,\u201d says Laurie\nWilliams, director of the Sierra Club\u2019s Beyond Coal campaign.\n\nTo avoid a future of ever-more-dangerous fires, floods and heat, we need to\nditch both fossil fuels \u2014 fast.\n\nThis is the hard part. This is the part that will require compromise \u2014 for\nconservatives who believe anything smacking of climate change is woke liberal\npropaganda, and for liberals who want nothing to do with conservatives\nspouting that belief.\n\nSo how do we do it? How do we stop clashing and start cooperating?\n\nFirst off, West Coasters need to engage in good faith with the people who have\nsupplied their power for decades \u2014 and strike deals that might persuade those\nred staters to move on from coal. Deals like building more wind farms in\nMontana and not as many back home, even if that means fewer union jobs and\nlower tax revenues for California, Oregon and Washington.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s great that the coastal states are targeting 100% clean energy, but it\u2019s\nnot enough. They must bring the rest of the West along for the ride, or it\nwon\u2019t matter. Every solar farm in California is undermined by every ton of\ncoal burned at Colstrip.\n\nThe lesson for folks who live in Colstrip and other Western coal towns, might\nbe even more difficult to swallow.\n\nL.A. and Phoenix and Portland have funded your comfortable lifestyles a long\ntime. Now they want something different.\n\nIf Colstrip wants to stick around, it needs to start offering something\ndifferent.\n\nClimate activist Anne Hedges stands in a public park near the Colstrip power\nplant.\n\n(Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times)\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why that\u2019s a scary prospect. After we finish exploring the\ncoal mine with Hedges, we drive into town and stop at one of the immaculately\nmaintained public parks. The power plant\u2019s two active smokestacks aren\u2019t far,\nlooming 692 feet over a swing set and red-and-blue bench with the letters\n\u201cUSA\u201d carved into the backing.\n\n\u201cThe climate doesn\u2019t care who owns the power plant,\u201d Hedges says, as steam and\ncarbon and soot spew from the stacks.\n\nThe climate won\u2019t care any more when Houston-based Talen Energy \u2014 which\noperates the plant, and which didn\u2019t respond to requests for a tour or\ninterview \u2014 becomes the facility\u2019s largest owner next year, acquiring Puget\nSound Energy\u2019s shares.\n\nOur ability to solve this problem doesn\u2019t depend on which company is profiting\noff all that coal.\n\nWhat it does depend on is our willingness to make hard choices, ranchers and\nminers and activists setting aside their differences and writing the West\u2019s\nnext chapter together, rather than fighting so long and so hard that the tale\nends badly for everyone.\n\nChange is scary. But it\u2019s inevitable. Cowboy poet Wally McRae learned that the\nhard way.\n\nMaybe 50 years from now, his great-grandchildren will wax poetic about the\nbeauty of Colstrip without coal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupport our journalism\n\nYour support helps us deliver the news that matters most.
