However, the\niStore service centre required that the phone be wiped to comply with the\nPOPIA act prior to any kind of service work commencing. This was annoying, but\nbeing a thin client with good backup hygiene it was just inconvenient and not\na major issue.\n\nOnce I had my phone back up and running with all my apps re-installed I found\nmyself browsing Hacker News and followed a link to an article on one of the\nbigger news sites. And there were ads EVERYWHERE. I'd forgotten to re-install\nmy adblocker.\n\nHaving not been on the internet without an adblocker in over 10 years, this\nwas eye-opening. It was literally impossible for me to read the article due to\nall the slide ins, animated banners, giant separators in the content, hot\ngirls in my area, and the like. And it wasn't alone. Most of the sites I\nvisited via Hacker News were covered from head to toe in ads.\n\n\"Enshittification\" is a term coined by Cory Doctorow, which accurately\ndescribes what was happening here. A decreasing quality of online services in\nan attempt to monetise. It is also used to describe companies that offer a\nfree service but start charging once they've locked in a client-base (I'm\nlooking at you Heroku).\n\nI'd rather a product not exist in the first place if their business model\nrequires them to eventually enshittify after they've lured people in. Because,\nunfortunately, a subsidised product crowds out products that are more basic,\nyet more sustainable in the long run. Creating something that captures market\nshare and then turns the tables actively harms their users, and the market in\ngeneral.\n\nOn the other hand, I love the internet. It's a place where people come to\nshare ideas and digitally congregate. I see it as a bunch of campfires\nsprinkled throughout the darkness of cyberspace. I currently hang out on a\nSlack channel of devs in South Africa, where I can talk shop. I also spend a\ndecent amount of time reading about people moving to new cities; interesting\nside projects; thoughts and musings; slices of life; and more on the Bear\ndiscovery feed.\n\nI feel like these niche communities are so much harder to organically stumble\nupon since the wide-spread commercialisation of the internet. The first page\nof any major search engine, no matter what you search for, will be entirely\npopulated with SEO goop, quite possibly written by AI, or indistinguishable\nfrom it.\n\nThere's a reason many people are now searching Reddit rather than Google.\nSince it's more difficult to monetise content on Reddit, there is less\nincentive to stuff it with SEO goop in an attempt to capture keyword rankings.\nThat being said, even Reddit is becoming worse to use. Every page load tries\nto get me to install the app, they've killed off most third-party apps, and\nold.reddit.com is almost impossible to use on mobile. So even the\n\"alternative\" to traditional search engines is getting shittier.\n\nHere's the part where I try to wrap up this post with a nice little bow, and\nsay something like \"and all we need to do is X\" (damn, X is now a thing...so\nmaybe Y). But I can't. I don't have a solution. The internet is a\ndecentralised free-for-all, and there are obvious economic incentives to be\nexploited. I foresee communities becoming more exclusive, and I predict a\nfuture where curation and moderation are the hills that content sites and\nfeeds live and die on. I'll hold on to RSS right until the end.\n\nP.S. If you're looking for something nice to read, the Bear discovery feed is\nworth checking out.\n\n##### Enjoyed the article? I write about 1-2 a month.
