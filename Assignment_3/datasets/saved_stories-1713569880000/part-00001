Not only is most of the internet based on\nopen source software, but thousands of programs, non-profit organizations, and\ncompanies depend on openly developed software libraries.\n\nCurrently, lots of open source libraries have only a single person who is\nresponsible for its maintenance. However, reasons for not being able to put\ntime into security fixes and the further development of a project are\nmanifold. They reach from leaving the company or losing interest, to changes\nin your personal life, up to sad circumstances like illness, burnout or death.\n\nIf maintainers are not able to look after their projects anymore and they did\nnot give anyone else access to their repository and the package registry,\ntrouble is sure to follow. It will get harder and harder to keep the project\nwell-maintained, even if the community is involved in taking it over.\n\nAdoptoposs claims that open source software can be better maintained and\nmaintainers will be healthier when following one important rule:\n\n\u201cEach and every open source software project of considerable popularity should\nhave a team of co-maintainers.\u201d\n\nWhen a project gains popularity, original creators and maintainers will need\nhelp. Adoptoposs offers them a platform to find co-maintainers or put their\nprojects up for adoption. It allows to make the initial contact between\nmaintainers and future co-maintainers.\n\nReady for helping with open source maintenance?\n\nLog in with GitHub\n\n  * FAQ\n  * Found a bug?\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Contact\n\nFind us on GitHub\n\nMade with | Phoenix LiveView | Tailwind CSS\n\nBy using this website you agree to our Cookie Policy.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
