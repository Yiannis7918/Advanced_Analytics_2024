Growing numbers of merchants are considering using\nit, Sankar added, which has seen peer-to-merchant transactions account for an\nincreasing share of all CBDC transactions in the country.\n\n\"The CBDC pilots are currently in operation, with increasing number of use-\ncases and participating banks,\" revealed RBI. The bank has proposed to expand\nuse of retail CBDCs by enabling non-bank payment system operators to offer\nCBDC wallets.\n\nThese operators would presumably include third-party app providers like Google\nPay, and major India payment app company PhonePe.\n\nCBDCs are a digital form of fiat currency and are being tested around the\nworld. India's trials have focused on both wholesale and retail transactions.\n\nAnother announcement from the RBI last week saw the bank propose permitting\nthe use of third-party UPI payments from Prepaid Payment Instruments (PPIs).\n\nIn February, RBI announced it would enable programmable features and offline\ncapability in its digital currency.\n\nOn Friday, local media interpreted Sankar's press conference comments as\nindicating work on programmability is under way. He cited a use case where a\nfarmer transferred money designed specifically for buying agriculture-related\nitems.\n\nOffline CBDC usage is still being tested, and will launch at a later date,\nexplained Sankar.\n\nIndia's Universal Payments Interface is rapidly becoming one of the world's\nmore prominent payments schemes, with the government promoting its use as a\nmeans of luring tourists and speeding cross-border payments. If India's CBDC\ntakes off at home, it too could become a model for other banks around the\nworld. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * CBDC\n  * India\n  * Unified Payments Interface\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * CBDC\n  * India\n  * Unified Payments Interface\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Aadhaar\n  * Aatmanirbhar Bharat\n  * Bharti Airtel\n  * Payments\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * APAC\n\n#### More about\n\n1 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * CBDC\n  * India\n  * Unified Payments Interface\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * CBDC\n  * India\n  * Unified Payments Interface\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Aadhaar\n  * Aatmanirbhar Bharat\n  * Bharti Airtel\n  * Payments\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * APAC\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Vigorous US lobbying reportedly reversed India PC import license scheme\n\nWashington was most displeased and New Delhi knew it made a mistake\n\nPersonal Tech17 days | 5\n\n#### Indian court halts operations of government-run social media fact checker\n\nRights groups protested potential for sneaky censorship of political rivals\n\nPersonal Tech17 days | 1\n\n#### SWIFT embraces central bank digital currencies after sandbox success\n\nPromises it can handle digi-bucks and tokenized assets without new\ninfrastructure, maybe next year\n\nSoftware13 days | 20\n\n#### Developing AI workloads is complex.
