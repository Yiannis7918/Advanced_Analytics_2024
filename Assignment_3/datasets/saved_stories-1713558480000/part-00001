Normally, I post the abstract of my conference talk\nfor these sorts of things, but since I am moderating a roundtable, I don\u2019t\nhave an abstract or paper to share.\n\nI should add the game, while still very much early access, is already very\npretty. The large walled structure in the center is my modular little wooden\ncastle.\n\nHowever, I have been able to play the upcoming medieval city-builder-strategy\nhybrid Manor Lords as they let me have a review-code, so I thought I might\nshare some of my quick first impressions of that. We are in that magic window\nwhere the embargo on impressions is lifted, but before the embargo on reviews,\nso I can tell you about my experience playing the game, but I cannot yet\nanswer if it is worth buying or good or not or that kind of thing. Also, I\nshould note that the build I am playing is a pre-release build of a game that\nis releasing into early access later this month, so this is the pre-pre-\nrelease build. Large parts of it are unfinished, because that\u2019s how early\naccess works.\n\nWhat I can say is that Manor Lords has an interesting angle on the medieval\ntown and the city-builder genre. Like Farthest Frontier (the main competition\nin this space) there is a lot of Banished DNA in the game, but neither game is\na Banished-clone. Both of them push off in different directions. If I had to\nsimplify, I\u2019d say that Farthest Frontier is about building a medieval town \u2013\nan urban center with a civic government mostly notable for its economic\nproduction \u2013 whereas Manor Lords is, as the title implies, about building a\ncastle-town, a settlement nucleated around the private house (the manor) of a\nmilitary aristocrat (the lord) who owns the land and which can be primarily\nunderstood as a settlement primarily military in character.\n\nYou can see the pull those two different focuses have on mechanics. Both games\nhave seasons and crop rotation, but Farthest Frontier\u2018s system is rather more\ncomplex. Manor Lord\u2018s agricultural system isn\u2019t bad \u2013 you can already do two-\nfield rotation systems and given that they let you schedule out three seasons\nper field, I have to imagine the addition of legumes to enable the classic\nmedieval European three-field rotation (cereals then legumes then fallow;\nrepeat) is coming. But it isn\u2019t as much a focus. By contrast, both games have\nmilitary aspects, but here Manor Lords already has much more development,\nallowing fairly fine command of your forces in battle and including a\ndistinction between levies villagers and professional retinue troops. It\u2019s\nfocused on small-scale warfare \u2013 appropriate for the medieval-inspired setting\n\u2013 with Total War-esque mechanics.\n\nThe modeling of the game\u2019s economy is also quite interesting. As with many\ncity builders, there are some big simplifying assumptions here. Rather than,\nsay, dozens of households managing their own production and consumption, the\nplayer (as the Lord \u2013 and the game is very explicit that you are playing as\nthe landholding noble here, you can even walk around town in third-person\nclose-up) assigns folks to their jobs and all resources go into a common\nstore. That does make for some economic simplification, as you aren\u2019t dealing\nwith individual seigneurial contracts with individual households, though there\nis a system in place for a portion of your village\u2019s wealth to be converted\ninto money-resources, presumably representing dues owed the lord.\n\nWhat is really neat is that you don\u2019t assign individual workers to jobs, you\nassign families. And that\u2019s actually a really interesting idea that opens up a\nlot of neat design space. As moderns, we often think about individuals as the\nbasic unit of labor in a society, but as we\u2019ve discussed before, in pre-modern\nsocieties, the household, generally but not always built around a nuclear\nfamily, was instead the basic economic unit, with labor roles in the household\noften (but not always) gendered. Different households might have different\neconomic roles in the community and those roles were \u2018sticky,\u2019 with\nexpectations that a given family did certain things, often replicated through\nsystems of apprenticeships and so on. For production where the end product is\nsupposed to be distributed to people, these families in game will set up\nlittle stalls in your central market where other families can acquire the\ngoods. Interestingly, leather and textile goods are sold as raw fabric\n(\u2018leather\u2019 \u2018linen\u2019 \u2018yarn\u2019) rather than finished clothes and I wonder if this\nis meant to imply household production on gendered lines.\n\nRight now, this mechanic isn\u2019t super-developed, but the organization of the\ngame into households rather than individuals opens up a lot of interesting\nspace. Liability for military service abroad, obviously an interesting factor\nfor a game like this, was often based on households rather than individuals,\nwhich obviously would have very different impacts on a family with four sons\nthan a family with only daughters! Likewise, households were not always\nefficiently sized as units of labor for their economic role, either with too\nmany or too few members, something the game could easily represent. That said,\nas it stands now, all families are of a standard size (three individuals). The\ngame doesn\u2019t yet fully utilize this design-space, but I really hope they do,\nconfronting the player with all sorts of awkward family units and\ninterrelationships as development progresses.\n\nThe other exciting element of production here is household production. When\nfreshly built, houses are just houses and the player could, if their goal was\nto maximize population over space, keep them that way, packing them in\nrelatively small lots. But you can also give the housing lots (\u2018burgage plots\u2019\nbecause they\u2019re renting from you, the lord) more space, which can be used for\nvarious kinds of household production, like small-scale horticulture and\nanimal rearing (to give you more food variety), but also artisan production.\nSo instead of having some purpose-built \u2018blacksmith\u2019 somewhere in town, you\nhave the blacksmith\u2019s house, which has his forge as part of the building,\nwhich is of course very frequently how small-scale production would indeed be\norganized. I rather hope as the game develops, the player increasingly has a\nchoice between household production at a relatively small scale and larger\ncentralized production. Do you want, for instance, a single household tailor\nin town, or a larger-scale tailoring workshop with a single master and dozens\nof hired laborers engaging in a lot more production. For right now, I think\nthe only production that crosses over is baking (either a communal bakery or a\nhousehold baker) and, somewhat oddly, it is the household baker that is more\nefficient.\n\nOf course the other neat thing about the structure of these burgage plots is\nhow they look, with the main structure sitting on a lot with a small open\nspace (which you can, at the cost of some resources, turn over to these\nhousehold production sites) and a fence around it. For a game focused on\nvillages and castle towns, which is to say about more rural settlements than\nFarthest Frontier (where your village rapidly becomes first a town and then a\ncity), this really captures better what the houses in a manor\u2019s village or a\ncastle\u2019s town might look like, often multi-purpose structures which combined\nhousing with storage (barns, etc.) and production.\n\nFarms! In the rain, as the snow slowly melts at the end of winter. The main\ntown is on the next hill in the distance.\n\nThe game is also interested in livestock as a form of agricultural capital in\na few interesting ways, though again a lot of these features are, at this\npoint, quite skeletal. Horses, sheep and oxen are all livestock you can get\n(but they have to be acquired). Sheep obviously produce wool, but there is\nalso an option on the \u2018tech tree\u2019 to be able to pasture them in your fallow\nfields to improve fertility, a factor in agriculture we\u2019ve discussed before.\nOne wonders if we\u2019ll see human waste availability also become a favor in the\ngame (as it is in Farthest Frontier), since human waste was often one of the\nthings which might \u2018belong\u2019 to the lord in these sorts of arrangements. Oxen\nmove certain heavy goods around (mostly timber) and there\u2019s an option to\nupgrade farms with plow-teams, which would have been a very important bit of\nagricultural capital, likely under the lord\u2019s control.\n\nOf course since the game is interested in warfare, all of these economic\nelements in turn make for tempting targets of attack. Local bandit camps,\nright now, if not engaged, will steal small bits of your agricultural\nproduction, but there\u2019s a lot of groundwork here for a more complex diplomatic\nand military system, engaging not just with bandits but with \u2018peer\u2019\naristocrats. Often the way these fellows competed in the small-scale warfare\nthe game is clearly focused on was through raiding agricultural resources. The\nfact that the game is actively tracking livestock makes me hope for cattle-\nrustling as something that, say, a squad of mounted nobles might do to inflict\ndamage on an opposing lord (using their speed to get in, wreck stuff and get\nout before the opponent\u2019s larger militia could be mobilized). Likewise, your\npersonal manor comes with modular (but still at this point, very basic)\ncastle-design tools and I hope we see a lot of development on fortifications,\nwith the player being strongly incentivized to move anything really valuable\ninside at least basic defenses to avoid being counter-raided in exactly the\nsame way.\n\nTo summarize then, this is a game still in its early days (as implied by\n\u2018early access,\u2019 but I do want to stress this is an early early access build,\nmany promised features are not yet implemented) but it fits into a trend I\u2019ve\nnoticed where the medieval or medieval-inspired-fantasy space is where the\ninnovation is right now with city-builders (while ancient-oriented games\nstagnate, alas!). I\u2019m really quite excited to see this innovation and the neat\nhybrid games they are producing, as developers seem to be iterating on what a\nhistorical city-builder (or castle-town-builder!) can be and how it can work.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n## Published by Bret Devereaux\n\nView all posts by Bret Devereaux\n\nPublished April 19, 2024\n\n## 2 thoughts on \u201cGap Week: April 19, 2024 (Manor Lords First Impression)\u201d\n\n  1.

Did they have a method of treating it to be safe? Or was it more for\nother purposes like urine for leather tanning?\n\nLoading...\n\nReply\n\n  2. Alien@System says:\n\nApril 19, 2024 at 10:27 am\n\nI\u2019ll give Banished a lot of credit for creating this design space of the\nsmall-scale city builder, where you have to assign and manage a small number\nof workplaces and workers with more care. But I feel like a lot of these games\nget lost in micromanagement weeds and break down as soon as you try to scale\nup. It\u2019s not yet a quite perfect game structure, but then again, the\nImpressions city-builder also had to do a lot of evolving to refine its\napproach, so I\u2019m certainly in a \u201cwatch this space\u201d optimism about the genre.\n\nConcerning ancient city-builders, I wonder if the matter is that with the\ncurrent trend towards more individual simulation and assignment, the just more\nabundant source material is a major factor. Historians can tell you about the\nstructure, labor distribution and economy of a medieval village with more\nconfidence than about that of an Ancient Egyptian village. In addition, I\nthink the medieval political model (especially manorialism like here) fits the\nphilosophy of the city-builder, in which the city is the biggest political\nunit and you as player are in charge of it, better than the ancient states,\nwhich lack such a small independent unit \u2013 the absurdity of always having a\n\u201cPalace\u201d central building in the Impressions games, or the royal family\npresent in Children of the Nile (even at the start of the game, when the city\nis just a bunch of hovels along a road) does not do the immersion any favours.\n(Interesting aside: Because the Chinese wuxia and xianxia genres have a\nconvention of the world being full of mostly independent sects of martial\nartists, they can quite readily and neatly use these for the city-building and\nadjacent genres) I think for a return to the ancient empires, some developer\nwill have to figure out a way to simulate the hierarchy above the city\nmagistrate in a way that doesn\u2019t feel like pure punishment, which I think is\nwhat the historical reality would feel like: Once a year, the tax gatherer\ncomes by and carries off your surplus, once every few years, some of your\ncitizens get drafted into a war and might not come back, and if you\u2019re really\nunlucky, an army comes by and does some foraging. To me, it sounds about as\nfun as the random disasters from Banished, meaning not at all.\n\nLoading...\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a ReplyCancel reply\n\nUpdates every Friday!\n\nYou can support this project via Patreon, and by spreading the word!\n\n# Recent Posts\n\n  * Gap Week: April 19, 2024 (Manor Lords First Impression)\n  * Fireside Friday, April 12, 2024\n  * Collections: Phalanx\u2019s Twilight, Legion\u2019s Triumph, Part IVb: Antiochus III\n  * Fireside Friday, March 29, 2024 (On Roman Values)\n  * Fireside Friday, March 22, 2024\n  * Collections: Phalanx\u2019s Twilight, Legion\u2019s Triumph, Part IVa: Philip V\n\n# Questions?
