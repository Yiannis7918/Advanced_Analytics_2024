More and more,\nwe have remote teams and complex distributed systems, along with the growing\nneed for frequent launches and an acceleration of teams, processes, and\nsystems moving from a centralized model to a distributed model. All of this\nmeans that an organization and its systems need to be more resilient than\never.\n\nWith the increasing use of cloud computing, sharing resources efficiently has\nbecome easier. The development of multi-tenant applications is increasing\nexponentially, but although the use of the cloud is more understood and\ncustomers are aware that they are in a multi-tenant environment, what they\nstill want is the experience of a single-tenant environment.\n\nThis guidance aims to demonstrate how to increase the resilience of critical\napplications, bringing the same fault isolation concepts that AWS applies in\nits Availability Zones and Regions to the level of your workload architecture.\nIt expands one of the best practices from the AWS Well-Architected Framework,\nUse bulkhead architectures to limit scope of impact, to help you reduce the\neffect of failures to a limited number of components.\n\n##\n\nIntroduction\n\nResilience is the ability for workloads\u2014a collection of resources and code\nthat delivers business value, such as a customer-facing application or backend\nprocess\u2014to respond and quickly recover from failures.\n\nAt AWS, we strive to build, operate, and deliver extremely resilient services,\nand build recovery mechanisms and mitigations, while keeping in mind that\neverything fails all the time. AWS provides different isolation boundaries,\nsuch as Availability Zones (AZs), AWS Regions, control planes, and data\nplanes. These are not the only mechanisms we use. For more than a decade, our\nservice teams have used cell-based architecture to build more resilient and\nscalable services.\n\nOur service teams have a track record of developing services on a global scale\nwith high availability and one of the things that contributes to this high\navailability and resiliency is the use of cell-based architecture.\n\nEvery organization is at a different point in their resilience journey\u2014some\nare just beginning, while others might be more advanced and may require\nextreme levels of resilience in their applications. For these types of\napplications, this guidance can help you increase the resiliency of your\napplications and increase the trust of your services with your customers.\nCell-based architecture can give your workload more fault isolation,\npredictability, and testability. These are fundamental properties for\nworkloads that need extreme levels of resilience.\n\n##\n\nAre you Well-Architected?\n\nThe AWS Well-Architected Framework helps you understand the pros and cons of\nthe decisions you make when building systems in the cloud. The six pillars of\nthe Framework allow you to learn architectural best practices for designing\nand operating reliable, secure, efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable\nsystems. Using the AWS Well-Architected Tool, available at no charge in the\nAWS Management Console, you can review your workloads against these best\npractices by answering a set of questions for each pillar.\n\nDocument Conventions\n\nShared Responsibility Model for Resiliency\n\nDid this page help you? - Yes\n\nThanks for letting us know we're doing a good job!\n\nIf you've got a moment, please tell us what we did right so we can do more of\nit.\n\nDid this page help you? - No\n\nThanks for letting us know this page needs work.
