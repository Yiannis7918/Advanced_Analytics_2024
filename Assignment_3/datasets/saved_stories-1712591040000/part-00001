When the policy\nis in effect, it does two things: first, it overrides the Host\u2019s booking\ncancellation policy and enables guests to cancel eligible upcoming and active\nreservations at the impacted location for a refund; and second, it also allows\nHosts to cancel reservations without fees and other related consequences.\n\nNow, the policy will explicitly apply to foreseeable weather events, like a\nhurricane during hurricane season, that result in another covered event\nhappening, like a government travel restriction or large-scale outage of\nessential utilities. This means guests with eligible reservations can cancel\nand receive a refund and Hosts can cancel without fees and related\nconsequences.\n\nAs an example, if a hurricane were to impact Florida during hurricane season\nand this led to a mandatory evacuation order, under the old policy affected\nbookings for this destination would not be eligible for a refund. With this\nupdate, in these same circumstances, guests with affected bookings do qualify\nfor a refund.\n\n> \u201cThe changes to this policy, including its new name, were made to create\n> clarity for our guests and Hosts and ensure it\u2019s meeting the diverse needs\n> of our global community. Our aim was to clearly explain when the policy\n> applies to a reservation, and to deliver fair and consistent outcomes for\n> our users. These updates also bring the policy in line with industry\n> standards.\u201d\n>\n> Juniper Downs, Airbnb\u2019s Head of Community Policy\n\nOther updates to this policy include:\n\n  * Limiting coverage to large-scale events at the destination location only to help balance the needs of our entire community. This means that the policy will only apply for reservations where a major disruptive event has impacted the location of the listing.\n  * Making clear that mid-trip cancellations can be made due to a covered event, with guests receiving a refund for any nights they didn\u2019t stay and without fees and related consequences for Hosts.\n  * Reminding Hosts that they\u2019re obligated to cancel reservations if their listing is uninhabitable or no longer consistent with what was originally booked by their guest, and that they are able to do this without cancellation fees and related consequences.\n\nAs this cancellation and refund policy is not designed to apply to all types\nof unexpected issues and emergencies that can impact a trip, guests should\nconsider purchasing travel insurance.\n\nThese policy updates come into effect for all reservations taking place on or\nafter June 6, 2024.^1 Full details of our Major Disruptive Events Policy can\nbe found here.\n\n^1Except as otherwise notified by Airbnb to certain users. Application of this\npolicy may vary where required by local laws and regulations.\n\n## About Airbnb\n\nAirbnb was born in 2007 when two Hosts welcomed three guests to their San\nFrancisco home, and has since grown to over 5 million Hosts who have welcomed\nover 1.5 billion guest arrivals in almost every country across the globe.\nEvery day, Hosts offer unique stays and experiences that make it possible for\nguests to connect with communities in a more authentic way.\n\nDownload logo assets\n\n## Related stories\n\n### Our commitment to fighting hate\n\nMarch 15, 2024\n\n### An update on our policy on security cameras\n\nMarch 11, 2024\n\n### Airbnb Q4-2023 and full-year financial results\n\nFebruary 13, 2024\n\n#### Support\n\n  * Help Center\n  * AirCover\n  * Anti-discrimination\n  * Disability support\n  * Cancellation options\n  * Report neighborhood concern\n\n#### Hosting\n\n  * Airbnb your home\n  * AirCover for Hosts\n  * Hosting resources\n  * Community forum\n  * Hosting responsibly\n  * Airbnb-friendly apartments\n\n#### Airbnb\n\n  * Newsroom\n  * New features\n  * Careers\n  * Investors\n  * Airbnb.org emergency stays\n\n#### Disclaimer\n\nThe Airbnb Newsroom is aimed at journalists.
