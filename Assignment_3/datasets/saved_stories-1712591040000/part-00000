To\naddress those challenges, we assembled a group of SEO experts and consultants\nto evaluate the best way to build on the strength of the WooCommerce brand. We\ncollectively believe that reverting back to WooCommerce.com will deliver the\nbest outcomes for WooCommerce and the wider Woo community.\n\nThe decision wasn\u2019t taken lightly, but ultimately, we believe this change is\nin the best interest of building on WooCommerce\u2019s recognition across the wider\nWoo ecosystem.\n\n## What do I need to do to prepare for the change?\n\nAs with our previous domain name change in October 2023, we\u2019re asking you to\nupdate any URL references to Woo.com back to WooCommerce.com in your marketing\nmaterials, documentation, or code following the migration on April 9, 2024.\n\n## What about branding or visual identity changes?\n\nNo updates to icons or branding identity are needed to support this change.\nThe original domain change was just one part of our overall evolution to Woo\nas our core brand, and the updated brand remains the same.\n\nWe know this domain name change may require time and effort for some of our\npartners. We appreciate your cooperation as we focus on regaining our normal\ntraffic levels and reaching an even wider merchant audience over the coming\nmonths.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Pinterest\n  * LinkedIn\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n## 2 Responses\n\n  1.

Right now https://woocommerce.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2013/01/UPS-Packaging-Settings.jpg is live.\n\nI hope that your team can close these gaps and get this traffic back!\n\nReply\n\n## Leave a reply\n\n  * Share:\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n\n## WooCommerce\n\nThe most customizable ecommerce platform for building your online business.\n\nGet Started\n\n  * 30-day money-back guarantee\n\n  * Support teams across the world\n\n  * Safe and secure online payments\n\n## Footer Links\n\n### Sell\n\n  * WooCommerce\n  * Payments\n  * No-Code Customization\n  * Marketing\n  * Checkout\n  * Shipping\n  * Mobile App\n  * Enterprise Ecommerce\n\n### Extensions & Themes\n\n  * WooCommerce Extensions\n  * WooCommerce Themes\n  * New\n  * Essentials\n  * Collections\n  * Developed by Woo\n\n### Build\n\n  * Woo for Developers\n  * Developer Resources\n  * Stores: Become a WooExpert\n  * Products: Extensions, SaaS, Themes\n\n### Resources\n\n  * Blog\n  * Documentation\n  * Email Newsletter\n  * Support\n  * WooCommerce Hosting\n  * Customer Showcase\n  * Hire an Expert Agency\n  * Customer Success\n  * Support Policy\n  * Refund Policy\n  * Participate in Customer Research\n  * Accessibility\n\n### Woo\n\n  * About\n  * Press\n  * Trademark guidelines\n  * Brand and logo guidelines\n  * Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\n  * Contact Us\n\nX Facebook Instagram\n\nCopyright WooCommerce 2024 Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Privacy Notice\nfor California Users\n\nAn Automattic company\n\n%d\n\nUse of your personal data\n\nWe and our partners process your personal data (such as browsing data, IP\nAddresses, cookie information, and other unique identifiers) based on your\nconsent and/or our legitimate interest to optimize our website, marketing\nactivities, and your user experience.\n\nNotifications\n\n", "frontpage": false}
