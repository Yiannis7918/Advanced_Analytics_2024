However, most sellers refer to it as just 7S26. It is the\nsame thing. Equally suitable for this project would be 7S26B or 7S36.Which one\nto buy?With so many watches featuring a 7S26 movement, it would be tricky to\npick one without doing a bit of research. Like any other market place, this is\nwhat you will find on eBay:Since your goal is to learn how the watch works,\nthen the only appropriate stock would be \"in working order\". You are buying a\ncomplete watch! It must have the case, bracelet, dial, hands, and the lot. Box\nand papers are not important.It MUST keep time.It goes without saying: any\nincomplete or water damaged Seikos should not be on your shopping list.My\npersonal recommendation: if money is not an issue, go for a brand new one!\nThat's what I just did - I've just bought a SNK639 fitted with 7S26 movement\nfor $65.99 including free delivery. Why? Because I already have a bunch of\nincomplete movements which I can use for parts. It will be a very nervous\ncouple of weeks now till the baby arrives!You are now standing at a crossroads\n(the first one of many to come!).Both options are equally attractive - joy of\nsourcing discontinued parts or joy of wrecking a perfectly new watch :-)Should\nyou decide to go for a preowned Seiko then you must engage yourself in\nconversation with the seller. Try to find an enthusiastic seller who is prompt\nto reply and answer all your questions. The time keeping bit is crucial - it\nMUST keep reasonably good time (up to +/- 15 seconds per day. There should be\nno cracks in the case or crystal, no water damage and no rattling noise! But\nfinding an enthusiastic seller who is going to waste couple hours on you for\nthe sake of a $20 sale is always challenging. Squeezing a dollar or two is a\nwaste of time, but watch out for shipping costs and especially delivery time.\nYou want your baby in less than 2-3 weeks!Again there is so much to choose\nfrom so don't buy the first one you see.ModelDon't go for pre-1996 models like\n7002, 7009 or even older 6119, 6023 etc. While those movements do look similar\nthey are completely different and a DIY online tutorial will not be much good\nfor you.Also spare parts are incredibly difficult to source for those old\nmodels.Read the title and description carefully and ask the seller to verify\nmovement calibre- some sellers know less about their goods than you!In case\nyou insist to work on your own Seiko calibre then you can still follow DIY\nproject but you won't be able to squeeze the most out of it.Keep in mind one\nthing: there are hundreds of websites out there with beautiful photos of 7S26\nbut 98% of them are created by watch owners, not watchmakers. Even those 2%\nwhich are, are put up with the aim of explaining a certain feature or as an\noverview - not as a step by step DIY assembly tutorial! Therefore it is in\nyour interest to be 'on the same page' with the rest of the group by working\non the same calibre.Next chapter: More shopping: getting the right tools for\nthe job!  \n---  \nPrevious Chapter | Home | Next Chapter| Mailing list: SEIKO 7S26 DIY Mailing list home pageTo join please click above link or send a blank e-mail to 7S26-subscribe@yahoogroups.comThe mailing list will serve to allow better communication between 'students' and allow the rest to follow the progress of our project.
