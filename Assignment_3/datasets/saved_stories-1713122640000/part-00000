She\nis also the host of Hell or High Water: When Disaster Hits Home, a podcast\nfrom Vox Media and Audible Originals.\n\nApr 11, 2024, 7:14 PM UTC\n\n## Share this story\n\nExecutives hold shovels during a groundbreaking ceremony at the Occidental\nPetroleum and 1PointFive carbon removal plant in Ector County, Texas, on April\n28th, 2023.\n\nImage: Jordan Vonderhaar / Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nAttempting to filter enough carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere to make a\nsignificant impact on climate change would require hundreds of billions of\ndollars in government spending, according to a new report.\n\nThe suite of technologies emerging to attempt that task all fall under an\numbrella called carbon dioxide removal, or CDR. It\u2019s still risky and\nastronomically expensive. But there\u2019s been growing chatter about it,\nparticularly as the US continues producing record amounts of oil and gas.\n\nAccording to the new report by research firm Rhodium Group, the US needs to\nspend roughly $100 billion a year on CDR in order to scale up to a level that\nwould help the country meet its climate goals. A majority of that needs to\ncome in the form of supportive policies like tax credits and procurement\nprograms.\n\nThere\u2019s been growing chatter about it, particularly as the US continues\nproducing record amounts of oil and gas\n\nFor comparison, the Inflation Reduction Act passed in 2021 includes $369\nbillion for clean energy incentives \u2014 the nation\u2019s largest climate investment\nto date. So $100 billion of government spending annually, as the report\nrecommends, is a lot to spend on novel technologies that have yet to prove\nthemselves at scale and potentially still not enough to make this strategy\neffective. It\u2019s a big gamble, with the livability of our planet as we know it\non the line.\n\nSolving climate change is a numbers game, and the goal \u2014 as defined by the\nUnited Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \u2014 is to reach net-\nzero carbon dioxide emissions by roughly 2050. That\u2019s what\u2019s needed to stop\nglobal average temperatures from rising 1.5 degrees Celsius higher than they\nwere before the Industrial Revolution.\n\nCrossing that threshold means that climate-related disasters like extreme\nheat, sea level rise, and biodiversity loss become significantly worse,\nperhaps surpassing humans\u2019 ability to adapt to these changes in the most\nvulnerable parts of the world. That 1.5-degree target was set in the Paris\nagreement nearly a decade ago in 2015 \u2014 but greenhouse gas emissions are still\nclimbing.\n\nThe US is already dumping a good chunk of cash into capturing CO2, even though\nthe only way to stop climate change and meet goals set under the Paris\nagreement is to stop depending on fossil fuels. The 2021 Bipartisan\nInfrastructure Law includes $3.5 billion to build new carbon removal hubs\nacross the US. Big companies including Microsoft and Amazon are also paying\nstartups to capture some of their pollution. And the fossil fuel industry has\nembraced the technology, even using it to market supposedly more sustainable\noil. Apparently, that still isn\u2019t enough.\n\nThe US will need the capacity to draw down a gigaton of CO2 by 2050 to meet\nnet-zero goals, the report says. It\u2019s an enormous amount of carbon dioxide to\ncapture, equivalent to roughly 20 percent of the nation\u2019s carbon footprint.\nThe country\u2019s capacity to take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere is tiny in\ncomparison now \u2014 in the low single-digit megatons so far.\n\nThe report points to three different tactics for taking carbon dioxide out of\nthe atmosphere: natural methods that rely on plants, soil, and the ocean to\nabsorb CO2; building machines that capture carbon dioxide; and hybrid\ntechnologies that employ both natural and engineered processes. All three\nstrategies pose their own challenges.\n\nTree planting has been the most popular nature-based tactic so far \u2014 to little\nsuccess. A growing body of research and investigations has found that\noffsetting emissions with forestry projects has largely failed. The trees\noften don\u2019t survive long enough to make a meaningful dent in atmospheric CO2,\nfor example, and then there\u2019s double counting when more than one group claims\nthe carbon credits.\n\nMachines that suck carbon dioxide out of the air or seawater are supposed to\nbe better at keeping track of the amount of CO2 they trap. But the enormous\namount of energy they use makes these devices inefficient and exorbitantly\nexpensive. It costs upward of $600 to filter a ton of CO2 out of the air.\nMultiply that by a gigaton (a billion metric tons) and you get to hundreds of\nbillions of dollars of spending.\n\nWith that in mind, spending $100 billion on CDR is likely a minimum of what\nthese technologies could cost, according to Joseph Romm, senior research\nfellow at the Penn Center for Science, Sustainability, and the Media.\n\n\u201cI think there is a misleading level of certainty in this report,\u201d Romm says.\n\u201cIt is premature to be scaling up any of these [technologies]. These need a\nlot more study.\u201d There are so many limitations to the most studied CDR\ntechniques \u2014 including tree planting and machines that capture CO2 \u2014 that Romm\nsays the money would be better spent researching other ways to reduce\ngreenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\u201cThe two most urgent things that we have to do now, are stopping deforestation\nand stopping putting more CO2 into the air,\u201d he says. Once that\u2019s happening,\nthen it could be worth it to stretch resources toward carbon dioxide removal\nthat tackles our historic emissions. But why put a Band-Aid on the problem if\nwe aren\u2019t stopping the bleeding?\n\nFeatured Videos From The Verge\n\n## PSVR 2: future of VR, tethered to the past\n\n1/1 Skip Ad Continue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE\n\nSony\u2019s PSVR 2 launches February 22nd for $549.
