Andrea Kane / Institute for Advanced Study\n\nThe 2023 Turing Award\u2014the computing world\u2019s Nobel Prize equivalent\u2014has been\ngiven to mathematician Avi Wigderson for his groundbreaking and widely\napplicable contributions to computer science. The honor comes with a $1\nmillion prize.\n\nOver his decades-long career, the 67-year-old Institute for Advanced Study\nprofessor concerned himself with whether a problem could be solved, rather\nthan what the answer might be\u2014part of a specialization known as theoretical\ncomputer science.\n\n\u201cAs far as we know, for every problem that we face and try to solve, we can\u2019t\nrule out that it has an algorithm that can solve it,\u201d Wigderson tells Quanta\nMagazine\u2019s Stephen Ornes. \u201cThis is the single most interesting problem for\nme.\u201d\n\nAt the center of his work are randomness and unpredictability. Computers tend\nto work in a predictable way, following determined patterns. But beginning\nwith his research in the early 1980s, Wigderson discovered that in some\ninstances, adding unknowns\u2014or randomness\u2014to particular algorithms could turn\nup a solution more easily and quickly. And conversely, he found that\nrandomness could be removed from other algorithms, making it easier to arrive\nat a solution.\n\nHis work to study and refine this relationship\u2014between randomness and a\nproblem\u2019s difficulty and solvability\u2014has had profound impacts on modern\ncomputing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to work in any space in computer science without actually\nintersecting with Avi\u2019s work,\u201d Madhu Sudan, a computer scientist at Harvard\nUniversity who collaborated with Wigderson on research in the past, says to\nQuanta Magazine. \u201cAnd everywhere, you find very deep insights.\u201d\n\nWigderson (left) helped reshape researchers' understanding of randomness in\ncomputation. Andrea Kane / Institute for Advanced Study\n\nYannis Ioannidis, president of the Association for Computing Machinery, the\norganization that awards the Turing prize, called Wigderson a \u201ctowering\nintellectual force in theoretical computer science,\u201d in a statement this week.\n\nHis contributions, for example, helped researchers make better sense of one of\nthe field\u2019s most famous unproven conjectures, called the P versus NP problem.\nIt asks: If the solution to a problem is easy to verify, is the problem itself\neasy to solve? The conjecture suggests easy and hard problems for computers\nare fundamentally different. With randomness, Wigderson helped clarify\nparticular proofs and discover unique instances in which both easy and hard\nproblems were the same.\n\nWigderson also wrote about how concepts in theoretical computing can be\napplied to various natural and human-made processes\u2014randomness could play a\nrole in solving hard problems, such as finding a cure for cancer, writes the\nNew York Times\u2019 Cade Metz. Randomness governs lots of processes in the world,\nfrom stock markets, to internet gossip, to the spread of disease and the\nactivity of bacteria in a Petri dish.\n\nAs such, the impact of Wigderson\u2019s work has expanded far beyond computer\nscience. The modern fields of cryptography, cloud computing and blockchain\ndevelopment are all imbued with principles and discoveries from Wigderson.\n\nAvi Wigderson, 2023 Turing Award Laureate, Q&A with David Nirenberg | Institute for Advanced Study\n\nWatch on\n\nFor instance, his work with randomness and algorithms helped advance zero-\nknowledge protocols, a crucial method within computer security that allows for\nthe transfer and confirmation of sensitive information between parties. In its\nmost simple working, one party is able to prove that a condition is true to\nanother party, without revealing any other details. Random, unique digital\nkeys also help secure online data.\n\nIn another testament to how describing and harnessing randomness stretches\nacross multiple fields, the discipline has recently received recognition in\nmath. The 2024 Abel Prize, the world\u2019s top award in mathematics, was given to\nFrench mathematician Michel Talagrand last month for his advances in\nstochastic systems, which help model random variables more precisely.\n\nAmong a variety of other awards, Wigderson won the 2021 Abel Prize\u2014along with\nmathematician L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Lov\u00e1sz\u2014for work that helped connect math with computer\nscience. This new honor makes Wigderson the only person to win both a Turing\nAward and an Abel Prize.\n\n\u201cAvi\u2019s impact on the theory of computation in the last 40 years is second to\nnone,\u201d Oded Goldreich, a computer science professor at the Weizmann Institute\nof Science in Israel, tells New Scientist\u2019s Alex Wilkins. \u201cThe diversity of\nthe areas to which he has contributed is stunning.\u201d\n\nFor all his achievements in predictability, one process that Wigderson didn\u2019t\nsolve was his own Turing Award announcement.\n\n\u201cThe [Turing] committee fooled me into believing that we were going to have\nsome conversation about collaborating,\u201d Wigderson tells New Scientist. \u201cWhen I\nzoomed in, the whole committee was there and they told me. I was excited,\nsurprised and happy.\u201d\n\nGet the latest stories in your inbox every weekday.\n\nChristian Thorsberg | READ MORE\n\nChristian Thorsberg is an environmental writer and photographer from Chicago.\nHis work, which often centers on freshwater issues, climate change and\nsubsistence, has appeared in Circle of Blue, Sierra magazine, Discover\nmagazine and Alaska Sporting Journal.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  1.
