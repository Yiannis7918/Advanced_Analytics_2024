Why is that? What distinguishes those who are successful\nin doing it from those who aren\u2019t? The answer is simple: a startup's ability\nto get customers to love it.\n\nIn this piece, Rami McCarthy and I discuss customer love as a recipe for\nbuilding winning cybersecurity startups. Rami is a security engineer, author\nof an active blog for technical security practitioners, and a frequent\ncontributor to tl;dr sec, one of my favorite newsletters. I am excited to have\nRami contribute his first article to Venture in Security.\n\n#\n\nSignificance of customer love for the success of cybersecurity startups\n\nNo matter the industry or domain, customer love can influence business\nsuccess. It has the potential to drive inbound leads, turn users into\nevangelists, and make it possible to quickly win the hearts and minds of\ndecision-makers.\n\nThis is especially the case in cybersecurity.\n\nCompanies where technology is a profit center (SaaS, infrastructure providers,\nfintechs, biotechs, and others) and companies where security has embraced an\nengineering mindset, are more likely to have smaller security teams. In these\norganizations, individual contributors are usually well compensated, actively\ninvolved in the industry, familiar with industry trends, and influential on\nbuying decisions. It\u2019s not uncommon to see a team that consists of a CISO and\none or two mid-level product security engineers, which means that these mid-\nlevel (and sometimes even junior) hires often end up running the proof of\nvalue (POV) process for large contracts.\n\nTraditional organizations, on the other hand, tend to have more complex\nsecurity environments and subsequently longer lists of factors that could\nbecome a show-stopper for making a purchase. Additionally, because their\nsecurity teams are larger and less engineering-driven, they have more people\nwho need to be able to quickly learn new tools.\n\nRegardless of which kind of organization the startup is selling into, being\nable to elicit customer love can be a game changer as it shifts what people\npay attention to. When security practitioners and leaders are evaluating\nproducts that have achieved a great reputation and are loved in the community,\nthey are usually focused on the positives, seeking to find what others love\nabout these tools. The opposite is true as well: when doing diligence on a\nvendor that has a bad reputation, buyers are more likely to be critical. After\nthe tool is deployed, the consequences of customer love only get stronger.\nPeople who love a security product are much more likely to:\n\n  * Share useful feedback - because they want you to succeed.\n\n  * Be less critical and patient with the product\u2019s gaps - a huge perk when you\u2019re an early startup.\n\n  * Participate in content and event marketing - webinars, customer stories, engineering blogs.\n\n  * Recommend the solution to others - because sharing something you love is a win-win.\n\nPeople who are satisfied with a product are usually open to doing inbound\nreferrals when someone in their network has a problem they need solving and\nexplicitly asks for a recommendation. Customer love is something else - it\ngoes beyond product recommendations. The best way to spot customer love is\nwhen users start evangelizing about the product without being asked, when they\ntake it to social media to share their experiences, when they incorporate the\nproduct in their conference talks without the vendor\u2019s knowledge, and so on.\nNo one credible is going to do free advertising, even for a really good\nproduct, unless they have a strong feeling of connection and value.\n\n#\n\nExamples of customer love in cybersecurity\n\nWhen we think about examples of customer love in cybersecurity, one company\nthat immediately comes to mind is Thinkst Canary. Thinkst Canary is a fully\nbootstrapped product company that as of December 2023, had crossed over $16M\nin ARR.\n\nThere are many things Thinkst Canary did differently to get where they are\ntoday. First and foremost, the company focused on building a great product -\none that is easy to deploy, inexpensive to buy, and very simple to use.\nThinkst is uniquely great at what is often called \u201cengineering as marketing\u201d -\nusing valuable, free solutions to generate awareness of the product & get\npeople to use it. Canarytokens, described by the company as \u201ctiny tripwires\nthat you can drop into hundreds of places\u201d that are \u201ctrivial to deploy, with a\nridiculously high quality of signal\u201d, can be deployed for free. This fantastic\ntool has received a lot of love in the community. Thinkst Canary is a tool\nthat doesn\u2019t send many alerts - but when it finally does trigger a detection,\nthat single alert means something very worth paying attention to. When you\nthink about it, this is a huge challenge: how do you drive retention,\ndiscovery, and the \u201cwow\u201d moment with a product that ideally never makes a\npeep? The ambient customer love of Canaries is crucial social proof for\nbuyers. The number of happy Thinkst Canary users taking it to X (Twitter) and\nother social media to spread the word about their work is astounding.\n\nImage Source: Thinkst Canary\n\nAnother example of a successful player that is well-loved in the industry is\nDuo Security. Once upon a time, a large company was going through a\nparticularly nasty data breach. Their engineers stayed up at night trying to\nfix the problem. The Duo team decided to deliver pizza to support the hard-\nworking incident responders, even though this company was not even their\ncustomer. While this act of kindness never converted into a sale to this\nspecific enterprise, that wasn\u2019t the goal. By doing marketing differently, Duo\ngot passionate evangelists who would happily spread the word among their\nfriends and later advocate for the company\u2019s solutions at their next jobs.\n\nOne of the easiest ways to recognize security startups that put emphasis on\nfostering customer love is to look for the so-called \u201clove pages\u201d - web pages\nwith links to customer feedback. Of course, these pages aren\u2019t evidence that a\nproduct is genuinely loved, for that you need to look for faces you recognize\nand organic positive feedback coming from your security community.\n\nExamples of `/love` pages include Chainguard, Material, Impart, and Anvilogic.\n\nImage Sources: Chainguard, Material, Impart, and Anvilogic\n\nIt\u2019s important to not confuse customer love pages with customer testimonials.\nThe line between the two isn\u2019t always clear but it does exist. Many sites have\nwalls of customer testimonials but more often than not they read like \u201cthese\nare our customers giving us a quote\u201d, not like organic things people are\nshouting about in an authentic way. This isn\u2019t at all surprising as most\ncybersecurity products don\u2019t elicit the kind of love that would compel\nsecurity practitioners to talk to their friends or post on social media about\nthem.\n\n#\n\nWays to foster customer love in cybersecurity\n\nOver the past several decades, most cybersecurity solutions have been hard to\nlove. Some of the reasons include:\n\n  * The low signal-to-noise ratio, a high number of false positives, and the \u201cwe show you the problems and you have to fix them\u201d mentality created a lot of work for already under-resourced security teams.\n\n  * Poor user experience, along with reliance on training and documentation and insufficient support, made it hard to navigate security tools.\n\n  * Needing to attend multiple demos before one can access a tool and do a proof of value (POV) wasted a lot of security teams\u2019 time.\n\n  * Complicated technical products, by technical founders, can miss the mark on product design.\n\n  * Products either based or marketed on FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt).\n\nAll this also made it hard to adopt, mature, and realize the full value of\nsecurity solutions companies did purchase. The 2023 Panaseer security leaders\npeer report offers evidence that most security breaches could have been\nprevented by the tools enterprises already have in place. When security teams\nstruggle to understand how products work, what capabilities they do and do not\noffer, and what knobs and buttons have to be pressed to enable the\nfunctionality they are designed to provide, it\u2019s no wonder that most solutions\nget under-utilized. Add to the mix the large percentage of cybersecurity\nstartups that are solutions looking for problems, and it\u2019s no wonder that very\nfew companies in the industry are lovable.\n\nThe good news is that the bar for what can be considered a good product in\nsecurity is quite low. The bad news is that getting to a point where customers\ncan genuinely love what the startup is offering, and evangelize about the\ncompany among their peers does take time and focused effort. Here are some\nways for security startups to foster customer love.\n\n##\n\nPut people first\n\nEvery product is designed to be implemented and operated by people, so\ncybersecurity startup founders have to put people first. This means\nunderstanding who is going to use the product and which of their problems it\nwill be solving, who else besides the end users will be affected by the tool\nand in what ways, and how the product can impact the people\u2019s ability to get\npromoted, get a raise, or even retain their job.\n\nCompanies that put people first think about their go-to-market practices and\nmake decisions that prioritize relationship-building over transactional\ninteractions.\n\n##\n\nSolve papercuts and invest in user experience\n\nAn easy way to make people love a product is to relentlessly prioritize\nremoving papercuts. When users report bugs, gaps, and suboptimal product\nexperiences, product teams should be willing to listen and find a way to turn\naround and fix that, even though it may not be on a short-term roadmap.\nSecurity people are so used to bad user experience that if it\u2019s bad enough\nthat the vendor is hearing about it, founders should take it more seriously\nthan they would in other product domains.\n\nPapercuts prevent users from being able to realize the value of even the most\nadvanced security products. Fixing papercuts engenders emotional connection\nand makes people feel that they have an impact and are being listened to.\nThis, in turn, causes them to want to evangelize the product.\n\n##\n\nSolve problems, communicate value, and get out of the way\n\nThe times when security teams were satisfied with products that offer\n\u201cvisibility\u201d are coming to an end. Today, the amount of visible gaps has\nbecome overwhelming - thousands of workstations, tens of thousands of\ndependencies, hundreds of thousands of vulnerabilities, and so on. Security\nprofessionals need solutions that fix problems, don\u2019t just generate alerts to\nshow that there are problems. There are too many tools that say \u201cLook, there\nis an issue\u201d; and we need products that say \u201cHere is the issue I found, here\nis how I determined it to be the issue, and here is how I addressed it\u201d. A\ngreat example of a cybersecurity product that strives to solve a problem and\nget out of the way is Resourcely.\n\nIt is not enough to simply solve problems - founders need to design products\nthat make it easy for people to understand what is going on in the background,\nwhat exactly the tool is doing, and what value it provides. Without that,\nusers may take the work a security product does for granted or even cancel the\ncontract without realizing its importance.\n\n##\n\nPick a core area to focus on\n\nStartups need to focus and be very clear about who they are serving. This is\nbecause what can make them loved by one group, will not necessarily work for\nanother. CISOs and security practitioners love companies for different\nreasons. CISOs care most about the sales culture, pricing, relationships, ROI,\nand support. Buying pizza for security teams in the middle of an incident is\nlikely to resonate with them better than cold-calling and ambulance-chasing\n(\u201cYou would not have been breached if only you used our tool\u201d). Mike Pivette\nrecently wrote a great article about what works and what doesn\u2019t work for\nCISOs. Security practitioners, on the other hand, are likely to respond well\nto things like easy-to-access and free-to-try products, open source projects,\nand community leadership.\n\nCISOs and security practitioners aren\u2019t in competition with one another so\nstartups don\u2019t necessarily need to choose one group. But, since early-stage\ncompanies have limited resources, they need to pick one area to focus on. Some\nfounders are trying to do everything at once - assembling customer advisory\nboards and interviewing CISOs, but also launching open source, writing\ntechnical blogs, giving stuff away for free to practitioners, sponsoring\nBSides, speaking at conferences, and organizing capture the flag (CTF)\ncompetitions. Doing all this well at the same time requires resources -\nsomething startups usually don\u2019t have. Picking a core focus is critical for\nthese efforts to be successful.\n\n##\n\nBe authentic\n\nLast but not least, cybersecurity startups should look for ways to foster\ncustomer love while being authentic. A lot of companies try to brand\nthemselves as lovable using anthropomorphic mascots, sleek designs, and\nmarketing campaigns but that rarely translates into love. People crave\nauthenticity, and authenticity is best shown by being consistent about\nexperience partnering with a company throughout the whole customer journey,\nfrom initial interaction to post-closing support.\n\nAnother reason for being authentic is that authenticity sparks creativity.\nThere are many ways to build a genuine connection with the market by doing\nwhat a specific company and its founders are uniquely positioned to do.\n\n#\n\nThings to keep in mind about customer love\n\n##\n\nProducts that inspire love don\u2019t have to be revolutionary\n\nProducts that inspire love don\u2019t have to be revolutionary. Take Duo Security\nas an example: Duo didn\u2019t invent the concept of multi-factor authentication,\nand RSA tokens existed long before Duo started. Despite this fact, Duo\nSecurity was able to build a successful company to a large degree because of\ncustomer love the product was able to elicit. If people can fall in love with\nwhat\u2019s fundamentally a new generation of RSA tokens, they can fall in love\nwith many other products. The key is simplicity, and making cumbersome\nexperiences easier and much more pleasant.\n\n##\n\nDon\u2019t look for shortcuts\n\nGetting customers to love a security product takes a lot of time and effort.\nThere are ways to do it, but there are no shortcuts. Bribing people with $50\nAmazon gift cards to leave reviews on G2 doesn\u2019t work. Faking customer\ntestimonials by asking friends who have never used the solution to give a\nquote isn't the way to go either.\n\nThere are many cases when startups feature security leaders or practitioners\nas customers when in fact they are not. It\u2019s understandable why founders are\nasking their investors, friends, and former colleagues for help. What they\ndon\u2019t realize is that it\u2019s a small industry, and people talk, so eventually,\nsomeone will reach out to those who gave testimonials and ask how exactly\nthey\u2019ve used the product and what their experience has been.\n\n##\n\nBe realistic about what you can and cannot do\n\nFounders must understand that every activity comes at a cost, and be smart\nwhen they decide what to focus on. It\u2019s common for security startups to launch\nopen source or community editions of their products only to then realize that\nwhile free tools are easy to love, they are also quite costly to manage.\nSecurity entrepreneurs would benefit from examining their options,\nunderstanding what events, activities, or initiatives are most likely to make\npeople love them, and having a realistic conversation about the cost of each.\nIt may be better to, say, not release an open source project at all, instead\nof having to announce the end of support or the need to close-source it a few\nmonths later.\n\n##\n\nDon\u2019t lose sight of building a company\n\nLastly, it\u2019s important to not go too far when trying to build a deep\nconnection with customers. We frequently see that startup founders who do\nunderstand the value of fostering customer love, go too far and forget that\nlove is not a final outcome, but a way of offering value. Instead of seeking\nto be loved by everyone all the time, entrepreneurs must focus on building\nbusinesses that solve real problems for specific customer segments and\ngenerate revenue. While we don\u2019t think we as an industry should be striving to\ncreate soulless companies devoid of any culture and values, the opposite\n(world-loving projects with no commercial agenda) is not the only alternative\neither. Examples like Thinkst Canary, Duo Security, Tines, Chainguard,\nMaterial, Impart, Panther, Anvilogic, and LimaCharlie where Ross leads\nproduct, show that it is possible to be pragmatic (and successful!) as a\nbusiness and loved at the same time.\n\n##### If you like my blog, please subscribe & share it with your friends.
