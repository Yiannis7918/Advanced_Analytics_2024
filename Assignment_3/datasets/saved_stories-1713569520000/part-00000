It\u2019s cute. It claims to show why the numerals that we use\nlook the way that they do. Here it is:\n\nAccording to this, the shapes of the numbers was derived from a notation where\nfor each numeral contains its own number of angles. It\u2019s a really interesting\nidea, and it would be really interesting if it were true. The problem is, it\nisn\u2019t.\n\nLook at the numerals in that figure. Just by looking at them, you can see\nquite a number of problems with them.\n\nFor a couple of obvious examples:\n\n  * Look at the 7. The crossed seven is a recent invention made up to compensate for the fact that in cursive roman lettering, it can be difficult to distinguish ones from sevens, the mark was added to clarify. The serifed foot on the 7 is even worse: there\u2019s absolutely no tradition of writing a serifed foot on the 7; it\u2019s just a font decoration. The 7\u2019s serifed foot is no more a part of the number than serifed foot on the lowercase letter l is an basic feature of the letter ls.\n  * Worse is the curlique on the 9: the only time that curly figures like that appear in writing is in calligraphic documents, where they\u2019re an aesthetic flourish. That curly thing has never been a part of the number 9. But if you want to claim this angle-counting nonsense, you\u2019ve got to add angles to a 9 somewhere. It\u2019s not enough to just add a serifed foot \u2013 that won\u2019t get you enough angles. So you need the curlique, no matter how obviously ridiculous it is.\n\nYou don\u2019t even need to notice stuff like that to see that this is rubbish. We\nactually know quite a lot about the history of arabic numeral notation. We\nknow what the \u201coriginal\u201d arabic numerals looked like. For example, this\nwikipedia image shows the standard arabic numerals (this variant is properly\ncalled the Bakshali numerals) from around the second century BC:\n\nIt\u2019s quite fascinating to study the origins of our numeric notation. It\u2019s true\nthat we \u2013 \u201cwe\u201d meaning the scholarly tradition that grew out of Europe \u2013\nlearned the basic numeric notation from the Arabs. But they didn\u2019t invent it \u2013\nit predates them by a fair bit. The notation originally came from India, where\nHindu scholars, who wrote in an alphabet derived from Sanskrit, used a\nsanskrit-based numeric notation called Brahmi numerals (which, in turn, were\nderived from an earlier notation, Karosthi numerals, which weren\u2019t used quite\nlike the modern numbers, so the Brahmi numerals are considered the earliest\n\u201ctrue\u201d arabic numeral.) That notation moved westward, and was adopted by the\nPersians, who spread it to the Arabs. As the arabs adopted it, they changed\nthe shapes to work with their calligraphic notations, producing the Bakshali\nform.\n\nIn the Brahmi numerals, the numbers 1 through 4 are written in counting-based\nforms: one is written as one horizontal line; 2 as two lines; 3 as three\nlines. Four is written as a pair of crossed lines, giving four quadrants. 5\nthrough 9 are written using sanskrit characters: their \u201coriginal\u201d form had\nnothing to do with counting angles or lines.\n\nThe real history of numerical notations is really interesting. It crosses\nthrough many different cultures, and the notations reform each time it\nmigrates, keeping the same essential semantics, but making dramatic changes in\nthe written forms of individual numerals. It\u2019s so much more interesting \u2013 and\nthe actual numeral forms are so much more beautiful \u2013 than you\u2019d ever suspect\nfrom the nonsense of angle-counting.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThis entry was posted in Bad Numbers on July 21, 2015 by markcc.\n\n## 29 thoughts on \u201cArabic numerals have nothing to do with angle counting!\u201d\n\n  1.

While virtually all of the positional base-10\nsystems in use are derived from the Hindu-Arabic numerals, Wikipedia describes\nthe Suzhou numerals as being an unrelated positional base-10 system. I\u2019ve\nnever seen Arabic numerals used to refer to all positional base-10 systems,\nand it seems an unnecessary and confusing extension.\n\nLoading...\n\nReply \u2193\n\n  3.

The book is old enough to be out of\ncopyright, and the Internet Archive has a copy:\nhttps://archive.org/details/historyofmathema031756mbp\n\nIn this version, the ridiculous curl at the bottom of the 9 is replaced by an\nextension of the loop past the vertical line, giving two extra angles. But the\n7 is even worse.\n\nCajori does not, of course, give any credence to these hypotheses. \u201cThey serve\nmerely as entertaining illustrations of the operation of a pseudo-scientific\nimagination, uncontrolled by all the known facts\u201d.\n\nLoading...\n\nReply \u2193\n\n  5.

Like a jar, a pinch, a handful, a\ncart, a hectare. An Arabic symbol representing one pocket, two pockets, three\npockets. The abstract leap occurs in the relationship between the symbolic\nquantity holders. The necessity occurred in Sumeria between 10,000 BC and\n3,000 BC when the wealthy or powerful demanded a method to keep track of their\nbelongings like agriculture products and handiwork\u2019s and crafts. Writing and\ncounting were born. That\u2019s where the Semitic ancestors of the Phoenicians came\nin. Arab added the zero. India added the decimal point much later.

The truth of what the number\nshapes actually represent is amazing and so much more interesting. The reason\nwhy this idea of angles creating the shapes is so irritating, is that it\nobviously doesn\u2019t work and there is no logic to the decision of these\nparticular shapes. There are multiple ways of creating shapes within this\nalgorithm that possess the needed amount of angles to match the quantity of a\nnumber .
