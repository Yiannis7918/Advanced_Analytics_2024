With the help of large language models and vector\nembeddings, we conducted an in-depth analysis to determine whether the\nenhancements were solely due to A2P registration. We found that the\nimprovements in response rates differed among various categories, with \"app\nconversions\" showing the most notable gains.\n\n### 40%\n\nResponse rate before July 2023\n\n### 80%\n\nResponse rate after July 2023\n\n### 300%\n\nImprovement in conversion-yielding messages\n\n# After Twilio A2P: Using GPT to analyze SMS response rates\n\nIf you\u2019ve used Twilio to send text messages in the past few months, you may\nhave had to register an A2P (Application to Person) campaign. That entails\nconnecting your business details \u2014 EIN, business address, and point of\ncontact, for example \u2014 with your Twilio phone numbers.\n\nThe big US carriers like AT&T initiated the requirement, apparently hoping to\ncut down on burgeoning spam texts. After all, anonymous senders seem more\nlikely to exploit SMS channels and flout spam restrictions.\n\nAs longtime Twilio users, we jumped through the new hoops and wondered how\nthey might impact user response rates.\n\n## Background\n\nGetcho is an on-demand courier service and sister firm to K-Optional. You can\nuse Getcho to dispatch a delivery from its iOS and Android apps.\n\nGetcho\u2019s support team uses Twilio to talk to users. Sometimes they send\nautomatic notifications such as \u201cwe\u2019re at pick-up now\u201d. Other times, a human\nagent types up a message.\n\nOver the past few years, Getcho has managed tens of thousands of support\nchats; that includes plenty of data on both sides of July, 2023.\n\nWe helped Getcho examine response rates and analyze how user interaction has\nchanged.\n\n## The problem - confounding factors and an improving brand\n\nWe defined a \u201cresponse\u201d as a message from a user that we messaged less than 24\nhours before. We only looked at the first exchange with each user.\n\nWe ran the numbers and found that users replied twice as often after July 2023\n(40% vs 80%). That was easy.\n\nExcept we knew this was hardly a controlled experiment. For one thing, Getcho\nprobably wasn\u2019t sending the same types of messages then and now. If they\nimproved their verbiage, then any insight goes out the window.\n\nOn top of that, users probably reply more as a brand becomes reputable. Though\nGetcho isn\u2019t Uber yet, their active users have doubled a few times this year.\nUI and branding have improved. It\u2019s hard to ignore that factor in the data.\n\n## The solution - looking at response rates across vector embedding clusters\n\nWe accepted that we couldn\u2019t divorce reputation and response rate. So we\u2019d\nhave to take the data with a grain of salt.\n\nBut maybe we could control any changes we made to our text message content.\nInspired by Simon Wilson\u2019s primer on vector embeddings, we created 10 clusters\nof the text messages we sent and examined those response rates. In other\nwords: \u201cbreak our outbound texts into 10 types and give us the response rate\nfor each\u201d.\n\nThen we took a few dozen messages from each cluster, and had the GPT API\ngenerate an exemplar message which we used to label the group.\n\n## The results\n\n  1. Users responded slightly less to status updates. Message: \u201cYour courier, Jack has arrived\u201d. Before: 38%. After 35%.\n  2. Users responded thrice as likely to engagement messages. Message: \u201cHi there, I saw you checked a delivery price, but didn\u2019t dispatch. Is there something I can help you with?\u201c. Before: 7%. After: 21%.\n  3. Users responded more to niceties and greetings like \u201cthanks, have a nice day.\u201d Before: 38%. After: 54%\n  4. We sent more messages of the high-response types after July of 2023. This would indicate that better rates come at least in part from our messaging.\n\nWe can\u2019t conclude definitively that A2P changes helped response rates, but the\napples-to-apples comparison of each category makes it seem that way.\n\n## Footer\n\n#####\n\nAustin, Texas\n\nManhattan, New York\n\nChicago, Illinois\n\nContact\n\n### Stay Ahead with Software Innovation Insights\n\nSign up for our newsletter for the latest.\n\nLinkedinTwitterGitHub\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 K-Optional Software, LLC.
