He won the Arkle Challenge Trophy at the 2003 Cheltenham\nFestival, going on to win the Queen Mother Champion Chase the following\nyear,^[1] and then coming home third in the same race in 2005. He was trained\nby Paul Nicholls and was ridden by Ruby Walsh in every chase bar one. He is\nowned by John Hales who also owned One Man, who won the 1998 Queen Mother\nChampion Chase and the 1995 and 1996 King George VI Chase. His name derives\nfrom the top row of letters on the French keyboard layout.\n\n## Hurdling[edit]\n\nAzertyuiop won a hurdle at Auteuil, Paris in October 2000. He then went to\nWincanton in February and won the Kingwell Hurdle as a novice. That year's\nrenewal had a slightly substandard look to it. The runner-up Hors La Loi III\nwas in the middle of a poor run of form. Azertyuiop was due to be aimed at the\nCheltenham Festival's Triumph Hurdle rather than the Champion Hurdle. However,\nthe 2001 UK foot and mouth crisis ended the hopes of the Festival taking\nplace. In the 2001-02 season, he won one hurdle race, the Elite Hurdle, and\nwas well beaten in his other three races. He started the next season as a\nnovice chaser.\n\n## Chasing[edit]\n\nAzertyuiop went into the 2003 Arkle Challenge Trophy as a short-priced\nfavourite having won his three novice chases by at least 16 lengths. He won\nthe Arkle by 11 lengths.\n\nIn 2003-04, his form was mixed. He unseated Walsh in his first race and then\nlost to Moscow Flyer in the Tingle Creek Chase. His third race was a defeat to\nIsio in the Victor Chandler Handicap Chase. However, Azertyuiop was giving\naway nineteen pounds to the winner and twenty to the others. His Queen Mother\nChampion Chase prep race was at Newbury in the Game Spirit Chase, and he won\nby 12 lengths. The scene was set for a meeting at Cheltenham with the reigning\nChampion Chase winner Moscow Flyer. However, the latter made a terrible\nmistake at the fourth last fence and unseated Barry Geraghty. Azertyuiop won\nby 9 lengths from the 2002 champion Flagship Uberalles.\n\nIn 2004-05, he won his seasonal reappearance and then lost again to Moscow\nFlyer in the Tingle Creek Chase. His next race was a bid by his trainer to win\nthe 3 miles King George VI Chase. Azertyuiop's stamina gave out in the latter\nstages of the race, and he finished third. He then defeated his successor as\nArkle Challenge Trophy winner, Well Chief, in retaining the Game Spirit Chase.\nThe scene was set for a battle between him, Moscow Flyer, and Well Chief in\nthe Queen Mother Champion Chase. However, he made a very bad mistake at the\nwater jump. Azertyuiop came in third. He finished the season by finishing\nsecond to Well Chief at Sandown in the Betfred Celebration Chase.\n\nEarly in the 2005/2006 season, he suffered an injury which kept him off the\ncourse. The injury proved to be career ending, and Azertyuiop was retired on 8\nSeptember 2006.^[2]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"Azertyuiop takes victory\". BBC Sport. March 17, 2004.
