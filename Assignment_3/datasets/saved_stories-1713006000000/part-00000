It worked.\n\nSanderson has been very vocal about the state of audiobook royalties on his\nofficial blog, which he outlines here. For authors who have audiobooks on the\nAudible platform, there isn\u2019t much clarity in how royalties are paid. It\u2019s\nunclear what a sale means, how much of an Audible credit is given to authors\nwhen it is used to purchase their work, or just how audio royalties were being\ncalculated in general.\n\n\u201cI felt that the industry was taking advantage of authors because of their\nlack of powerful corporate interests to advocate for them,\u201d Sanderson wrote in\nhis recent blog post. \u201cWhile video game creators and musicians get 70-80% of a\nsale of their products on a digital platform\u2014Audible was paying as low as 25%,\nwith the high end being 40%.\u201d\n\nLoading Ad\n\n00:00\n\n/\n\n00:00\n\nSanderson says he felt he could have gotten a better deal for himself just\nnegotiating for his works, but he decided to do something that would impact\nthe whole industry. He withheld his most recent writing projects from Audible,\ninstead highlighting some of Audible\u2019s smaller competitors.\n\n\u201cI hoped this wake-up call would prompt change,\u201d Sanderson continues. \u201cI\ndidn\u2019t refuse to put my books on Audible out of retribution or to declare war;\nI did it because I wanted to shine as powerful a light as I knew how on a\nsystem that favored the audio distributors over the authors.\u201d\n\n#### The gambit worked as Sanderson says three key officers in Audible\u2019s\ncorporate structure flew to his offices to present a new royalty structure\nthat will be offered to independent writers and smaller publishers.\n\n\u201cThis new structure doesn\u2019t give everything I\u2019ve wanted, and there is still\nwork to do, but it is encouraging,\u201d Sanderson writes. \u201cThey showed me the new\nminimum royalty rates for authors\u2014and they are, as per my suggestions,\nimproved over the previous ones. The structure moves to a system like I have\nrequested, which pays more predictably on each credit spent\u2014and that is more\ntransparent for authors.\u201d\n\nPart of the new changes will see Audible pay royalties monthly instead of\nquarterly, with a spreadsheet breakdown that shows how the money is split with\nauthors. One of the key changes is giving authors a way to track how Audible\nis dividing money between books purchased with a credit and those listened to\nvia their Audible Plus program.\n\nThe move mirrors a similar one Taylor Swift made in 2018 when she asked\nUniversal Music Group to share proceeds from the eventual sale of its $1B+\nstake in Spotify with musicians signed to the label.\n\nShare on:\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Copy Link\n\n### Related Posts\n\n  *     * Save\n\n#### Latest Music Industry Hires: Round Hill, SESAC, Warner Chappell,\nDowntown, MaMA, More\n\nDylan Smith\n\nApril 12, 2024\n\n  *     * Save\n\n#### Amazon Music Announced As \u2018Exclusive Merch Provider\u2019 for Mariah Carey\u2019s\nLas Vegas Residency\n\nDylan Smith\n\nApril 12, 2024\n\n  *     * Save\n\n#### Another K-Pop Superstar Death \u2014 Park Bo Ram Passes Away, Aged 30\n\nAshley King\n\nApril 12, 2024\n\n  * #### Olivia Rodrigo Just Sold Out MSG Four Straight Times \u2014 And Other Fun Facts About Her North American Tour\n\nAshley King\n\nApril 12, 2024\n\n### Subscribe to Our Daily Newsletter\n\nTerms of Use | Privacy policy | Privacy settings Digital Music News \u00a92024.
