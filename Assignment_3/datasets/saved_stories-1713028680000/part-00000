Its body structure consists of three legs that are\nasymmetric to the body, so it cannot be easily balanced. In addition, the\nactuator is a servo motor that can only feed-forward rotational angle commands\nand the sensor can only sense the robot's posture quaternion. In such an\nasymmetric and imperfect body structure, we analyzed how gait is generated in\nwalking and stand-up motions by generating gaits with two different methods: a\nmethod using linear completion to connect the postures necessary for the gait\ndiscovered through trial and error using the actual robot, and a method using\nthe gait generated by reinforcement learning in the simulator and reflecting\nit to the actual robot. Both methods were able to generate gait that realized\nwalking and stand-up motions, and interesting gait patterns were observed,\nwhich differed depending on the method, and were confirmed on the actual\nrobot. Our code and demonstration videos are available here:\nhttps://github.com/shin0805/Chair-TypeAsymmetricalTripedalRobot.git\n\n#### Gimbal-Type 2-DOF Leg\n\nThe gimbal-type 2-DOF leg designed in this study is shown in the figure below.\nThe rotation axes of the two servo motors intersect at the apex of the leg,\nallowing the leg to move forward, backward, left, and right.\n\n#### System Overview\n\nThe system configuration diagram of the robot in this study is shown in the\nfigure below. The robot features an Arduino Nano Every that transmits command\nangles to six servo motors through the servo motor control board while\nreceiving quaternions of its posture from the IMU. The Arduino Nano Every is\nwired for connection with an external PC, using ROS to exchange command angles\nand quaternions.\n\n#### Gait Generation\n\nIn this study, two methods were employed to generate the gait of a chair-type\nasymmetric tripedal low-rigidity robot. The first method involves gait\ngeneration through connecting essential postures, while the second method\ninvolves gait generation through reinforcement learning.\n\n#### Bibtex\n\n    \n    \n    @inproceedings{inoue2024chair, title={{Body Design and Gait Generation of Chair-Type Asymmetrical Tripedal Low-rigidity Robot}}, author={Shintaro Inoue and Kento Kawaharazuka and Kei Okada and Masayuki Inaba}, booktitle={IEEE-RAS International Conference on Soft Robotics (RoboSoft)}, year={2024}, }\n\n#### Contact\n\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to contact Shintaro Inoue (s-inoue\n@ jsk.imi.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp).\n\n", "frontpage": false}
