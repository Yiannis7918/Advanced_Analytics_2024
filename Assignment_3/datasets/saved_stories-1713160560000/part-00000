He figured they knew\nthings that ordinary people just did not. I mean, of course they did, right?\n\nGOLDSTEIN: Obviously.\n\nOne day, Galton goes to a country fair. This was about a hundred years ago in\nEngland. And there's this contest going on at the fair - guess the weight of\nthe ox. Galton's a scientist and a statistician. And he figures, hey, I can do\nan experiment here, right? He figures, I'm going to take everyone's guesses,\ntake the average and compare that to the actual weight of the ox.\n\nKESTENBAUM: We heard this story from James Surowiecki. He's an economics\njournalist.\n\nJAMES SUROWIECKI: So he thought what you were going to end up with was a\nreally flawed guess because in his mind, what you were doing was you were\ntaking guesses of a few smart people, a few mediocre people and then a lot of\nmorons - 'cause he basically thought everyone was dumb. So he figured the\ngroup's guess was going to be way, way off the mark.\n\nKESTENBAUM: The contest organizers gave Galton the little slips of paper with\neveryone's guesses on them. He took them, calculated the average. The average\nwas 1,197 pounds. And the ox?\n\nSUROWIECKI: The ox weighed 1,198 pounds. So that - in other words, the crowd's\njudgment was, essentially, perfect.\n\nKESTENBAUM: One pound off?\n\nSUROWIECKI: One pound off.\n\nGOLDSTEIN: This is super creepy, right? Like, what's going on here? Is there\nsome kind of, like, collective unconscious magic?\n\nKESTENBAUM: Yeah, it's like a Ouija board or something, right? But the idea\nthat underlies this - it is everywhere. It's the idea of the stock market -\nyou know, thousands of random people buying and selling shares. Like, when you\nhear that Apple stock went up or the Dow plunged, that's basically people\nguessing the weight of an ox.\n\nGOLDSTEIN: Yeah, it's everywhere, right? It's the price of oil. It's the price\nof orange juice. All kinds of things that are really important to the world\nwork exactly this way.\n\nKESTENBAUM: But why should it work? Why should a bunch of random people - a\nlot of whom have no idea what they're doing - somehow magically produce an\nanswer that makes sense? Does this really work? And if it does, why does it\nwork?\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ALESSANDRO RIZZO AND ELLIOT GREENWAY IRELAND'S \"LA VIE PARIS\")\n\nGOLDSTEIN: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Jacob Goldstein.\n\nKESTENBAUM: And I'm David Kestenbaum. Today on the show, Mr. Galton, we redo\nyour experiment.\n\nGOLDSTEIN: What's the cow's name?\n\nKIRSTEN KUZMITCH: Penelope.\n\nGOLDSTEIN: Hi, Penelope. Thanks for letting us weigh you. Can I pet her?\n\nKUZMITCH: Yeah.\n\nGOLDSTEIN: She's chewing.\n\nKESTENBAUM: One pound off - come on.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ALESSANDRO RIZZO AND ELLIOT GREENWAY IRELAND'S \"LA VIE PARIS\")\n\nGOLDSTEIN: So we came up with a plan to repeat Galton's experiment. Find a\nfair and a cow and a big scale to weigh the cow. And then...\n\nKESTENBAUM: In secret. In secret.\n\nGOLDSTEIN: And then we were going to throw the question out to the crowd, ask\nthe world, how much does this cow weigh?\n\nKESTENBAUM: We didn't want to just limit it to people at the fair. So we\nfigured we'd take some pictures, post them online and ask the whole world to\nguess.\n\nGOLDSTEIN: So we went out to a county fair in Burlington County, N.J. We met\nPenelope the cow in the dairy tent. She was sitting on a bunch of hay.\n\nKESTENBAUM: Kirsten Kuzmitch (ph) was taking care of her.\n\nGOLDSTEIN: Can you just describe what she looks like?\n\nKUZMITCH: Yeah. She's mostly black. She has white legs, and she has a white\nspot in the middle of her head. But she's a big black cow (laughter).\n\nKESTENBAUM: What did you just say?\n\nGOLDSTEIN: I said holy cow without even realizing what I was saying. She's\nmuch bigger. She just stood up. She's walking out of the barn now. And she's\nway bigger than I thought when she was sitting down.\n\nKESTENBAUM: We took some pictures of you, Jacob, standing next to the cow for\nscale. And just for fun, we decided to ask people at the fair how much they\nthought Penelope weighed. As it happened, it was kids day, so there were a lot\nof kids around.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: Hi, Penelope.\n\nGOLDSTEIN: Which was fine. You know, they're nonexperts.\n\nKESTENBAUM: What's your name?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: Caleb (ph).\n\nKESTENBAUM: How much do you think Penelope weighs?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: Six pounds.\n\nKESTENBAUM: How'd you come up with that number?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: 'Cause I'm 6 years old.\n\nGOLDSTEIN: You guys want to guess how much this cow weighs.\n\nKARIN: Yes, sixty-hundred pounds.\n\nGOLDSTEIN: Like 6,000?\n\nKARIN: Yes.\n\nGOLDSTEIN: OK. Do you know how much you weigh?\n\nKARIN: Not at all.\n\nKESTENBAUM: I'm sympathetic. Looking at Penelope, I had no idea how much she\nweighed. Like, I didn't even know how to think about it. Did she weigh more\nthan my car? Did she weigh less than my car? I don't even know how much my car\nweighs.\n\nGOLDSTEIN: (Laughter) More than a cow. I'm going to say more than a cow.\n\nWe found an older group of kids. And, yeah, they also guessed on the low side.\nBut they had this bigger problem, this, really, more worrying thing. And it\nwas a problem that adults also seemed to have. And it was this. The first kid\nsaid a number. And then all the other kids said basically the same number -\nnumbers that were, like, too close to the first kid's.\n\nKESTENBAUM: It's like they were incapable of guessing anything different.\n\nESA: My name's Esa (ph).\n\nGOLDSTEIN: And, Esa, how old are you?\n\nESA: I'm 10.\n\nKESTENBAUM: And how much do you think that cow weighs?\n\nESA: Two-hundred pounds.\n\nGABRIELLA: My name's Gabriella (ph). I'm 10. And I think the cow weighs 300\npounds.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED CHILD #2: My name is Caleb (ph), and I am 7 years old. And I\nthink the cow weighs 300 pounds\n\nKESTENBAUM: Oh, Caleb (laughter).\n\nPeople are not that different from cows. We heard. If we don't know something,\nwe look for a leader, even if the leader maybe doesn't know anything.\n\nGOLDSTEIN: Penelope finished chewing, and we took her over to be weighed. It's\nactually pretty unusual to want to weigh a cow. And the scale they had at the\nfair was not for cows.\n\nWhat kind of scale is this?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON: It's actually like - a truck scale is what it's for -\nsame style of scale I'll use for big trucks and stuff, which we use it to\nweigh the tractors during the tractor pull.\n\nKESTENBAUM: But it'll work for a cow?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Yep.\n\nGOLDSTEIN: Kestenbaum, you were obsessed...\n\nKESTENBAUM: Paranoid.\n\nGOLDSTEIN: ...Arguably paranoid about keeping the results of this secret. You\ndidn't want it to leak out, I guess.\n\nKESTENBAUM: Yeah. And all these people had gathered.\n\nActually, can we clear - can we seriously clear everybody out except for just\na minimum of people? Like...\n\nGOLDSTEIN: Can we swear you to secrecy?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON: I'll swear.\n\nKESTENBAUM: OK, just you. Everybody else over there.\n\nKirsten walked Penelope up onto the scale.\n\nKUZMITCH: Easy.\n\nKESTENBAUM: And we watched this little digital display.\n\nKUZMITCH: Whoa.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Yep.\n\nGOLDSTEIN: OK. It's 1,355 pounds.\n\nKUZMITCH: We're good?\n\nKESTENBAUM: One thousand, three hundred and fifty-five pounds. We walked\nPenelope back to the dairy tent, and then we went home.\n\nGOLDSTEIN: The next day, we posted photos online of...\n\nKESTENBAUM: Of the cow and you.\n\nGOLDSTEIN: And me, right. I was there to give some sense of perspective.\n\nKESTENBAUM: We put you on the tractor scale.\n\nGOLDSTEIN: Yes, 165 pounds. That's how much - that's how much I weigh.\n\nKESTENBAUM: Then our colleague, Quoctrung Bui, here put it all up online.\nGuess the weight of this cow.\n\nGOLDSTEIN: And the idea was - our hope was that lots and lots of people would\nguess because the fundamental question here - the thing we're trying to figure\nout - is, if you have a bunch of random people making their best guess at\nsomething, do you get close to, you know, the truth? Do you get close to the\nright answer? So we put it up, and we waited for the results to come in.\n\nKESTENBAUM: All right. It's been up for how long now?\n\nGOLDSTEIN: Two minutes.\n\nKESTENBAUM: How many entries?\n\nGOLDSTEIN: There's 15 entries.\n\nKESTENBAUM: Reload, reload.\n\nGOLDSTEIN: OK, here we go.\n\nKESTENBAUM: It's still 15?\n\nGOLDSTEIN: Still 15.\n\nKESTENBAUM: Come on. Oh, my God. That's all we're going to get - 15.\n\nGOLDSTEIN: I'm going to retweet this.\n\nKESTENBAUM: (Laughter) You're worried it's already been buried after two\nminutes.\n\nGOLDSTEIN: (Laughter) I know.\n\nWe also showed the pictures of me and the cow to James Surowiecki. He's the\nNew Yorker writer we talked to at the beginning of the show. He actually wrote\na book called \"The Wisdom Of Crowds.\" So we asked him to guess.\n\nKESTENBAUM: Remember here, the actual weight of the cow - 1,355 pounds.\n\nSUROWIECKI: All right. I will guess that the cow weighs 725 pounds.\n\nKESTENBAUM: How did you come up with that number?\n\nSUROWIECKI: I don't know - maybe looks like four- or five-times Jacob's size,\nI guess. Although I'm sure cows are - well, I don't know. Are they denser or\nnot than humans? So you know, whatever. It's pretty random, actually.\n\nKESTENBAUM: Pretty random and pretty wrong. We told him Penelope's actual\nweight - twice as heavy as his guess.\n\nSUROWIECKI: (Laughter) It's so bad. It's a sad commentary that someone who's\nbeen talking about an ox for this long has absolutely no clue how much a cow\nweighs.\n\nKESTENBAUM: If we get a crowd of people like you, it's going to be terrible.\n\nSUROWIECKI: We're going to be in bad shape. I'm praying somebody was guessing\n2,200 on the other end.\n\nGOLDSTEIN: Because the key question is, what's the average going to be, right?\nIs the crowd going to get it right? Or at least how close are they going to\nget? So we left this up online for five days - let people guess for five days.\nOur colleague, Bui, tallied it all up. David, you and I came into the studio.\nWe didn't know the results. And Bui came in to give us the numbers.\n\nKESTENBAUM: First of all, how many people guessed?\n\nQUOCTRUNG BUI, BYLINE: So the number of people that guessed - 17,205 people.\n\nGOLDSTEIN: Seventeen thousand? That's legit. That's good. That's good.\n\nBUI: It's as if you got, like, a small town to all guess.\n\nKESTENBAUM: Bui took those guesses, added them up and calculated the average.\nThis was the big moment.\n\nBUI: You guys ready? One thousand, two hundred and eighty-seven pounds.\n\nKESTENBAUM: One thousand, two hundred and eighty-seven? Penelope actually\nweighed 1,355.\n\nGOLDSTEIN: Pretty close, right? So that's to within, like - what? - 60-ish\npounds?\n\nKESTENBAUM: That was pretty impressive.\n\nGOLDSTEIN: Yeah. I mean, they're only, like, 5 percent off, you know? And, OK,\nsure, the Galton thing was 1 pound off. This isn't that. But remember, this is\njust a bunch of random people, you know, looking at this little cow picture in\ntheir Facebook feed on their iPhone.\n\nKESTENBAUM: And here's another amazing thing. When we asked people to guess,\nwe also asked them this other question. We asked, are you an expert? Have you\never worked with cows? Because remember, Galton thought experts might be\nbetter. And 3,000-some people answered yes to that question. Jacob, you\nwondered, were they really, really experts?\n\nGOLDSTEIN: I mean, sure. These are just people clicking a button online. So we\nemailed a bunch of them, and we heard back. And they did seem pretty expert.\nYou know, a lot of them were farmers. One of them mentioned the, quote,\n\"absence of a visible udder.\"\n\nKESTENBAUM: Actually, a few of them mentioned that.\n\nGOLDSTEIN: (Laughter) And apparently that tells you something about how old\nthe cow is - how much it weighs.\n\nKESTENBAUM: So how did the experts do? Here's the answer.\n\nBUI: So the average guess for the experts was 1,272 pounds.\n\nKESTENBAUM: They're worse.\n\nBUI: They were worse. It's amazing.\n\nGOLDSTEIN: So OK - so maybe that is wisdom of the crowds.\n\nKESTENBAUM: To be fair, the experts were only marginally worse, but they did\nnot beat the crowd.\n\nGOLDSTEIN: We told Surowiecki about these results, and he wasn't surprised. In\nfact, he writes in his book, chasing the expert is a mistake. We should ask\nthe crowd.\n\nKESTENBAUM: And the fact that the larger crowd got it to within 5 percent - he\nsaid that seems about right to him. When people do versions of this experiment\n- asking people to guess the number of jelly beans in a jar, for instance -\nthe crowd usually gets it to within 3 to 5 percent.\n\nSUROWIECKI: You know, one of the things that's interesting about this is even\nthough I've written a book and done this experiment a number of times, every\ntime I do it and every time I hear the results, I'm like, it's not going to\nwork this time...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSUROWIECKI: ...Because the idea is so counterintuitive. You know, it's pretty\nextraordinary in that regard. The power of this - to actually let the group\narrive at really good decisions is - it's eerie. There's something eerie about\nit, I think.\n\nKESTENBAUM: It is eerie, right?\n\nSUROWIECKI: Yeah, it is. There's something magical about it that seems\nmagical, I think. It's not magic. It's just math, but it seems magical.\n\nKESTENBAUM: Surowiecki says the reason this seems to work is that every\nperson's guess is contributing some new, little piece of information.\nEverybody is different. Everybody thinks slightly differently when they're\ntrying to guess the cow's weight. Maybe one person studies that photo of the\ncow from the side. Some people are probably trying to figure out how many\nJacobs would fit in the cow. Someone else might know how much a horse weighs\nand kind of go from there.\n\nLike, every person's guess in some ways reflects their specific life\nexperience of judging the size of things in the world just from decades of\nliving. It's like every person's mind is a different scale for weighing the\ncow.\n\nGOLDSTEIN: Any one of those scales isn't going to be a great scale, right?\nEach one of those is probably going to be wrong. There's going to be some\nerror in every single one.\n\nKESTENBAUM: They're good in some way, but they also have some problem with\nthem.\n\nGOLDSTEIN: Yeah, and one of the essential things is those problems tend to\ncancel each other out, right? Maybe one person is wrong 200 pounds high, but\nthe next guy is wrong 200 pounds low. So the wrong parts - the wrongness -\nkind of washes out. And in the end, what you're left with is all those little\nbits of information. And the result is amazingly good. You know, collectively,\nwe do seem to know what we're doing.\n\nKESTENBAUM: Surowiecki says there are certainly times when this does not work,\nlike think stock market panics or bubbles.\n\nGOLDSTEIN: Yeah. A big problem is that thing we saw with the kids at the\nbeginning, where one person says a number and then everybody else around him\njust kind of latches on to that number. There's actually a technical term for\nthis. It's information cascade.\n\nKESTENBAUM: It's like, my neighbor just bought a house. That seems like a lot\nof money to pay for a house, but he did fine. I'm going to do the same thing.\nOr everyone's buying that stock. It must be a good stock. I'm going to buy it.\n\nSUROWIECKI: The stock market is not perfect, but what is amazing about the\nstock market is that investors individually, even very good investors, are\noftentimes irrational. They have tiny bits of information. They're making\ndecisions based on emotion or on, you know, some tip they got. And yet,\ncollectively, we trust them to set the value of all of these companies. It's\nkind of scary when you think about it.\n\nBut the interesting thing is I don't think there's a better way to do it, and\nthere is not a more effective way of doing it either.\n\nKESTENBAUM: This is why it is so hard to beat the stock market. The wisdom of\nthe crowd is pretty good. And the people who seem to beat it - who say, I can\nbeat the stock market - often, they are just plain lucky.\n\nGOLDSTEIN: In our experiment, for example, there were 15 people who got the\ncow's weight exactly right. They were off by 0 pounds.\n\nKESTENBAUM: We picked one of them at random as our winner. We called him up to\ntell him the news and to see how he did it.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING)\n\nHARRIS PAHLLICK: Hello.\n\nKESTENBAUM: Is this Harris (ph)?\n\nPAHLLICK: Yeah. How's it going?\n\nKESTENBAUM: Harris Pahllick (ph) is 20 years old. He's a student at Hamilton\nCollege, never touched a cow in his life. In fact, could not even remember his\nguess. We told him he'd guessed 1,355 pounds and that the weight of the cow\nwas also 1,355 pounds.\n\nPAHLLICK: Oh, my God.\n\nKESTENBAUM: You won.\n\nPAHLLICK: That's amazing. Do you want to know how I got to that guess?\n\nKESTENBAUM: Yes.\n\nPAHLLICK: I Googled it. I Googled average weight of female cow, and it said -\nhere. I'll get it. So it pops up in a little box. And it comes from Dairy Moos\n- dairymoos.com.\n\nGOLDSTEIN: Dairymoos.com says the average weight of a cow is 1,500 pounds,\ndepending on the age and whatever. Harris looked at the picture of Penelope\nthe cow and said, oh, she looks a little bit on the small side. He went with\n1,355. It was just a guess.\n\nPAHLLICK: Yeah, completely guessed.\n\nGOLDSTEIN: So we're going to send you the cheapest plastic cow trophy we can\nfind.\n\nKESTENBAUM: We talked with Harris about what we should put on the trophy\n'cause it's a bit of a puzzle, right? Like, should it say, I got lucky? He was\nactually fine with that. He said that made sense.\n\nGOLDSTEIN: I was pushing for mutual fund manager of the year.\n\nKESTENBAUM: Robert (ph) here suggested, someone had to win. In the end, I\nthink we are just going to say congratulations.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF DAVE BETHELL AND GEOFFREY MICHAEL GEIER'S \"HAPPY IS AS HAPPY\nDOES\")\n\nKESTENBAUM: Congratulations.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF DAVE BETHELL AND GEOFFREY MICHAEL GEIER'S \"HAPPY IS AS HAPPY\nDOES\")\n\nKESTENBAUM: All right, we got some footnotes. You know how at the end of\nresearch papers they put all the technical details there? A couple things we\nwant to tell you - when we calculated the average of the guesses, we did throw\nout outliers, like the person who just held down the nine key as their guess -\nnine, nine, nine, nine, nine.\n\nGOLDSTEIN: Nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine.\n\nKESTENBAUM: Thanks for that. Also, for people who love the median, we\ncalculated the median, too.\n\nGOLDSTEIN: I am a median lover. The median is the value in the middle where\nhalf the guesses are higher, half the guesses are lower. The median was pretty\nclose to the average. The median was 1,245 pounds - within 8 percent of\nPenelope's actual weight. The median expert guess was a little worse, but\npretty close. You can find all the numbers online at npr.org/money. Also,\nthere are some pictures of Penelope the cow, among other things, on our\nInstagram feed, @PlanetMoney.\n\nAnd one other thing - PLANET MONEY has a new weekly email newsletter. It's\ngreat. There are all these interesting questions, like, do plastic bag bans\nhelp or hurt the environment? Also, why did a bunch of countries in Europe try\na wealth tax and then give up on it? You can subscribe to the PLANET MONEY\nnewsletter at npr.org/planetmoneynewsletter.\n\nKESTENBAUM: You can also email us - planetmoney@npr.org. Thank you also to\neverybody for guessing. Thank you to Penelope the cow and to Rosemary Kay and\nthe other folks at the Burlington County Farm Fair.\n\nGOLDSTEIN: This show was originally produced by Nadia Wilson. Today's rerun\nwas produced by Liza Yeager and Rachel Cohn. Bryant Urstadt edits PLANET\nMONEY. Alex Goldmark is our supervising producer. I'm Jacob Goldstein.\n\nKESTENBAUM: And I'm David Kestenbaum. Thanks for listening.\n\nHow heavy is the cow?\n\nSANDY REO: Absolutely no idea. (Laughter) Absolutely no idea. I really\nwouldn't...\n\nKESTENBAUM: Like, does 10,000 pounds sound too heavy, or who knows?\n\nREO: I really have no idea.\n\nKESTENBAUM: Twenty-thousand pounds?\n\nREO: Twenty-thousand, I think, is going over the limit - yeah, no.\n\nKESTENBAUM: So less than 20,000.\n\nREO: Less than 20,000.\n\nKESTENBAUM: More than 5 pounds.\n\nREO: More than 5 pounds - more than a bird.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.
