Security cameras can use them to adjust the field\nof view remotely, astronomers can use them as telescope mounts to accurately\ntrack celestial objects, and of course photographers and videographers can use\nthem to add dynamic elements to shots. But getting the slow, smooth, and\nreliable movement isn\u2019t as simple as slapping some servos on a tripod. So\nunless you want to break the bank for a commercial mount, this DIY pan and\ntilt mount might be the way to go.\n\nThe mount is built largely out of 3D printed parts and a few fairly common\nmotors, belts, pulleys, and bearings. The movements are controlled using\nstepper motors, and there are two additional systems built in so that focus\nand zoom can be controlled through the system as well. The software\ncontrolling it all is open-source and available on GitHub, and controls the\nmount remotely through a network connection. It\u2019s also designed to use the\nreadily-available ESP32 chip, making it overall fairly adaptable.\n\nThe system doesn\u2019t slouch on features, either. It can move from one point to\nanother with various programmable speeds, has a key sequencer for more complex\nmovements, and can accommodate the needs of stop motion animators as well.\nIt\u2019s an impressive build that should be accessible to plenty of photographers\nwith a 3D printer and the right parts, but photography and astronomy aren\u2019t\nthe only reasons to use a pan and tilt mount. Check out this one that brings\nsome sunlight to a shaded room.\n\nPosted in digital cameras hacksTagged camera, ESP32, open source, pan and\ntilt, photography, remote\n\n## 2 thoughts on \u201cDIY Pan And Tilt Camera Mount\u201d\n\n  1. come2 says:\n\nAugust 23, 2023 at 2:11 pm\n\nIt is very polished and professionally-design, so much it seems\noverengineered, considering the number of features (there is even PoE). I may\nbe wrong, but without a demonstration footage, I fear that the steppers will\ncause vibrations in the image.\n\nAll things considered, it is very cool.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n    1.
