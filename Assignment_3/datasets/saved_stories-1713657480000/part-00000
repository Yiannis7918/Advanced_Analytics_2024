A small handful of\ncompanies: Meta, Google, ByteDance and Snap, dominate the share of eyeballs on\nsmartphones. Most mobile apps struggle to generate $1,000 in revenue per\nmonth. The number of apps people download is in sharp decline.\n\nAD\n\nBut Mayer, the former CEO of Yahoo and a longtime Google executive, is no\nstranger to the spotlight after years as a young, female Silicon Valley\ncorporate boss and her struggles to turn around Yahoo.\n\nAnd the idea behind Shine makes sense in the era of dying social media\nplatforms. It automatically creates albums around gatherings of people you\nknow and uses AI to remove duplicates, picking out the best ones. It saves the\ntime of having to create an album from an event and then adds everyone who was\nthere (hoping they all own iPhones).\n\nWe talked to Mayer about her startup, the AI landscape, and the tech industry\nwrit large (but before Munoz Torres left). Read below for an edited transcript\nof our conversation.\n\nAD\n\n### The View From Marissa Mayer\n\nQ: You started off with a contacts app and now you have a photo app. Can you\nexplain the strategy?\n\nA: Photos and contacts go together. It\u2019s obvious when you think about it, but\nthe contacts you\u2019re closest to, you tend to spend time with, and if you spend\ntime with them in this day and age you have photos of and with them. So you\ncan understand people\u2019s relationships if you can look at their camera roll.\nAnd now with the beauty of AI, we can actually analyze someone\u2019s camera roll\nreally succinctly and have an understanding of who you spend time with, when,\nwhere and why, at least in broad brushstrokes.\n\nThat\u2019s really useful when it comes to keeping people in touch with each other,\nhelping take those mundane, everyday touches and make them magical and really\nhelping people feel connected to each other. Contacts are a big part of that.\nIt was the foundation and that\u2019s why we started there. But photos are perhaps\none of the most meaningful ways that we all interact with each other. The way\nwe all build those relationships.\n\nAD\n\nQ: It resonates with me because I\u2019ve never loved social media but I do want to\nshare with people I know. Do you see consumer tastes changing these days in\nthe post-web 2.0 era?\n\nA: Yes, maybe. I also think that AI and our expectations from it are going to\ninfluence it. One way to think of it is if Instagram is one perfectly\nfiltered, edited photo that you push out to everyone you know and don\u2019t know\nwho is in your follower base, and person-to-person photo sharing is me\nsnapping a picture and texting it or air dropping it to you, Shine tries to\nsit in that space in between. The \u2018okay, I was just somewhere with 10, 20, 50\npeople.\n\nAnd it was an interesting night, but I didn\u2019t kind of want to take myself out\nof the moment and take a photo. But I know I took some, they took some, let\u2019s\njust make a big photo pool of what that trip, party, conference, event felt\nlike.\u2019 That\u2019s really the space we\u2019re trying to occupy.\n\nThere\u2019s not a lot happening in that space. I refer to it as smart, small-scale\nsharing. The early social networks and early social media tried to fill that\nspace. But then people would join, they wouldn\u2019t see a lot of the people there\nthat they wanted to share with. So they looked for who is famous, which is why\nyou suddenly started to get these counts into the millions for celebrity\nfollowers.\n\nBut at the same time, celebrities are interesting, but so are your friends,\nfamilies and your close contacts and they\u2019ve got stuff going on in their lives\nthat they want to share with you, too. That\u2019s really the space we want to play\nin. I think Snapchat showed this in a different way \u2014 you can share in a way\nthat\u2019s a little bit less perfect, and a little bit temporary and in the\nmoment. There\u2019s something really powerful about that.\n\nPlus the fact that, as engineers and product people, we look for everyday\nthings that just feel broken. And the fact that you\u2019re like, \u2018I know this\npicture was taken, and I don\u2019t have it, or my friend forgot to send it to me.\u2019\n\nOr that feeling that you have when you\u2019re at an event and you see someone snap\na scene of the first dance, the child blowing out the birthday candles and you\nfeel the need to pull your phone out and take the same picture. Because you\u2019re\nlike \u2018okay, the only way I\u2019m going to be sure I get it is I actually take it.\u2019\nTo me, these types of tools can let us be much more in the moment. At the same\ntime we don\u2019t want to just move a lot of photos around because there are lots\nof duplicates that aren\u2019t organized.\n\nQ: And that\u2019s how you\u2019re using AI? You\u2019re picking the best?\n\nA: I talked about how AI is going to change people\u2019s expectations. That\u2019s a\nbig part of it. Because now we can take photo sharing and make it so what you\nget is actually an organized album of things that people would want to share,\nthat you would want to see. And yes, if they took eight pictures and they\nweren\u2019t sure which one has all the eyes open, and they weren\u2019t sure which one\nwasn\u2019t blurry, AI can do all of that.\n\nQ: How else are you using AI?\n\nA: So we\u2019re doing AI-powered curation for the albums to understand what\u2019s\nshareworthy. When you\u2019re at an event there are things that aren\u2019t logical to\nshow up in the album and there are things that are. We\u2019re using AI there and\nalso to do the grouping near duplicates. We also use AI in our suggested\nalbums that live in our \u2018For You\u2019 tab.\n\nThe suggested albums are one of the most powerful features in the app because\nit doesn\u2019t mean that you have to necessarily have a Shine album right now. You\ncan actually build Shine albums in the past. We\u2019ve built AI algorithms that go\nback over the metadata of your camera roll. Where were you, when did you take\npictures? Basically analysis of it, and try to understand where and when you\ntake boring, mundane photos that you probably don\u2019t want to share, and where\nand when, and what do you take pictures of when they\u2019re pictures that you do\nwant to share? So we got AI operating there as well.\n\nAnd then one of the things that we noticed is that this is the kind of smart,\nsmall-scale sharing that you want to do at events. The natural place to get\nthe lead-in from that is invitations. So we have our Shine website that does\nevents. The nice thing is that in that case, you know the group of people, you\nknow they\u2019re all going to be there. And if you can actually just make the\nphoto sharing contiguous.\n\nIf you have all the RSVPs, it\u2019s all part of Shine. You\u2019re just naturally\njoined to the album, and you can enjoy the event, naturally participate in the\nphoto sharing, receive the photo sharing. Our invitations use a different form\nof AI, which is generative AI. We\u2019ve got really breathtaking, clever and\ncustom invitations that are based on AI prompts.\n\nQ: Those are great.\n\nA: Some of them have taken our breath away. Some of them make us laugh out\nloud. They\u2019re really fun and they really add a lot of personality to the\nevents that people are throwing.\n\nQ: You\u2019re a technical founder and you\u2019ve run teams of coders. Do you see AI\ntools changing the way software is developed?\n\nA: One of the most immediate impacts is in testing. The AI software is clearly\nthere. Lots of tools do a really good job with test harnesses. You can always\ndo more and you can always find more with testing, but I think that there are\nsome elements of coding and the process of bringing a product to market that\nare going to be AI-led sooner rather than later. Some of the end stage\nprocesses, like testing and QA, are clearly going to be better run and more\nefficiently run because of the AI tools.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t mean those jobs go away completely, but rather than writing the\ntest harness yourself, you can actually have the tools really do a lot of the\ndevelopment for you, which helps you cover a lot more cases and a lot more\nground quickly.\n\nQ: As somebody who started out in symbolic systems, do you geek out on the\narchitecture of these models these days?\n\nA: The thing that I\u2019ve found the most surprising and delicious in all of this\nis symbolic systems. Symbolic systems at Stanford is a unique major. It\u2019s\nbasically cognitive psychology with a really heavy CS bent. But the actual\nmakeup of the major is cognitive psychology: How do people learn? Philosophy:\nHow do they reason? Linguistics: How do they express themselves? And computer\nscience: Can you create a computer that can learn reason and express itself?\n\nI was fascinated by this in the mid 90s. Both my degrees at Stanford are in\nthe concentration or a specialization in AI for my bachelor\u2019s and my master\u2019s,\nrespectively. I thought that was very interesting and there\u2019s all these\nsymbolic systems. We see that thread, learn, reason and express yourself.\n\nI loved computer science from the very first time I coded. I didn\u2019t know much\nabout linguistics. I understood it was important for the intelligence to\nexpress itself, but my focus and I will say overall, the industry\u2019s focus, has\nover the past decade or two, been much more on learning. Building the models,\nreinforcement learning, all of the different techniques that go into building\na modern day model right now, and then deploying those models, giving them new\nthings to reason about and see how they perform. That\u2019s where all the energy\nis gone.\n\nAnd the big surprising thing that happened with OpenAI and ChatGPT, at least\nfor me, was that expression piece, that linguistics piece, that was perhaps\nunder-appreciated in that cycle of symbolic systems is what captured\neveryone\u2019s imagination, the fact that it can talk and express itself and write\nin a way that you can understand and feels really intelligent. The fact that\nDall-E can draw these wonderfully complicated pictures that would take an\nartist days or weeks to express. That really captured the imagination.\n\nSo it\u2019s funny because for a long time, I didn\u2019t understand and kind of\ndiscounted that expression piece. And in this moment, it\u2019s that expression\npiece that has been the big unlock for AI, and really helping everyone see its\npotential.\n\nQ: When you were at Google, all the deep learning that was happening then was\nreally a result of compute power. The ability to test a lot of these theories\nthat had been developed in academia. Now you have the data and you have the\ncompute resources to do it. But if you look at what\u2019s happening now, it just\ndwarfs what was going on then. Does that surprise you? Just how massive the\nresources are that are going into developing these things?\n\nA: Sure, I think that one they did not discount is the data, right? One of the\nreasons Google can do this is just the huge amount of data, as well as the\ncompute. It\u2019s easier to connect the dots backwards, than it sometimes is to\nconnect them forwards. I do think that when you look at everything Google did\nfrom spell check to Google Translate, this notion of building things that\nweren\u2019t modern day LLMs but basically used huge amounts of data, huge amounts\nof compute to make predictions about what comes next and how things should be\nconstructed, whether in another language, whether in terms of spelling.\n\nAnd so I think that it does boggle the mind what they\u2019re doing today. But when\nyou look back at those underpinnings and where Google was working, we were\nusing it on spelling and then later, we used it across languages. If you use\nthose same techniques, applied slightly differently within a language, you can\nalso get remarkable results.\n\nQ: If you put your CEO of a large company hat on, do you spend tens of\nbillions of dollars to scale up transformer models or do you use what\u2019s\nhappened with ChatGPT as the inspiration to find the next breakthrough and\narchitecture?\n\nA: The foundations of this, those underlying models are incredibly important.\nAt the same time, they are also even more incredibly expensive to build. So\neither you have to know you have natural applications that are going to sit on\ntop of those LLMs and those models that you build, which are going to be very\nuseful for people and therefore very profitable. Or you\u2019re going to have to\nmake APIs where other people are building applications on those models that\nhave that same type of lucrative nature.\n\nThat\u2019s why I remain really bullish on Google, because they have the data and\nthey have lots of natural applications in search, in email, in maps and docs,\nin lots of different areas where it absolutely makes sense for them to invest\nin that foundational model. They can build their applications and features on\ntop of it, and they can also make it available in various formats and APIs.\n\nI think for a medium or a small company, it makes sense to say no, I\u2019m not\ngoing to build a foundational model. I\u2019m going to count on technology giants\nto do it and then I\u2019m going to pick the model of theirs that works right for\nmy domain.\n\nQ: So you won\u2019t be developing your own foundation models?\n\nA: As a small start up, that doesn\u2019t necessarily make sense. I also feel\nempowered that we can pick among many different models. Even the cases that\nwe\u2019ve talked about here, from the AI that runs behind suggested albums, to\ncurated albums to the generative AI that powers our invitations, we\u2019ve got a\nbunch of different models and we can go in and shop for them and get them a la\ncarte.\n\nQ: So you\u2019re taking those and then fine tuning them?\n\nA: Exactly.\n\nQ: Is it good timing to be at a startup right now, as this technology becomes\nso powerful and potentially disruptive?\n\nA: It\u2019s a great time to be in technology because the big companies are doing\ninteresting things and so are the smaller companies. There are whole new\ngreenfield areas that are being opened up in terms of how this can be applied,\nhow it can be thought about and used.\n\nQ: But you still are within these walled gardens of Apple and maybe to a\nlesser extent, Google. Those restrictions put limits on your abilities. With\nthe recent antitrust litigation, what parts of that walled garden would you\nlike to break down?\n\nA: Location, maps, all things geo is something that is close to my heart\nbecause I worked on maps for a long time when I was at Google. I think that\nlocation is so powerful: Where we go, how we spend our time. It does affect\nyour photos, it affects who\u2019s in your contacts, or it should. Location can be\na big part of it. But I do think that the two platforms, Android and Apple,\nare different in terms of granularity, what they really allow you to access,\nand with how much ease.\n\nThey have different philosophies in terms of users and what they want to do,\nand the types of authorization they want to give. But it\u2019d be great if those\ntwo became more standardized, and really allowed developers to have access to\nthe same type of information that the platforms have.\n\nQ: Apple\u2019s line here is \u2018we\u2019re protecting our user privacy.\u2019 What do you say\nto that?\n\nA: I think user privacy and the trust that it builds is incredibly important.\nIt\u2019s important for Apple, it\u2019s important for startups. We know that especially\nin the type of work we\u2019re doing. Your contacts, your photos, are among the\nmost private things on your phone. So we need to really be very respectful of\nprivacy.\n\nAt the same time, we\u2019ve seen big historical examples and even modern everyday\nexamples, of people willing to, with a trusted source, offer views into their\nprivate information, if it\u2019s super useful to them. The classic example is your\ndriver\u2019s license. Why would you go and tell the state or the government, where\nyou live, what you weigh, how tall you are, your hair color, eye color, right?\nIt turns out driving is really, really helpful. So people make those kinds of\ntradeoffs.\n\nMy browser keeps track of my history and everywhere I\u2019ve gone and that\u2019s a lot\nof information about me, what I\u2019m interested in, what I\u2019m learning about.\nThat\u2019s very personal. But it\u2019s also helpful to later be able to ask \u2018wait,\nwhere was I? Where did I see that? Can I go back to my history?\u2019\n\nIf sharing data helps me get photos more easily and share photos more\nroutinely with less forgetting, then, I think there\u2019s a lot of people who\nwould say \u2018sure.\u2019 It\u2019s personal, but it\u2019s not even that personal in terms of\nwhere you were. Obviously your cell phone carrier has the same information,\nknowing where your phone was at different times. So there\u2019s other people who\nhave access to that same information that benefits you and also doesn\u2019t\nbenefit you.\n\nThis is a case that can clearly just benefit you. So overall I think there are\nusers who want to make that choice. They cannot be misled. That really\nviolates trust. But if they want to make that tradeoff, I think they should be\nable to do so more easily than they can today.\n\nQ: That tradeoff at Google and other companies means that your data will be\nmonetized. You\u2019re offering a freemium model. So does that mean you\u2019ll have the\nchoice of not having it monetized? I don\u2019t think you\u2019re doing any advertising\nat this point.\n\nA: Our contacts model is free, but you can pay us to export it back and become\nyour iOS contacts. So if you want your contacts upgraded on iOS, we\u2019ll take\nthe enhanced contacts we\u2019ve created, deduplicate, and enhance them. For Shine,\nour photos app, and our events app, right now they are just free. In our\nprivacy pledge that we laid out when we started the company, we don\u2019t sell\nyour information.\n\nWe want you to understand what information we have, exactly how it\u2019s used, and\nit should always benefit you as your data. You can take it with you at any\ntime. When we look at business models, I learned never to say never, but our\nproclivity and our actions to date are much more to go direct to consumers and\nto have services that people pay for either on a one time or an ongoing\nsubscription basis to ultimately monetize these services. So there\u2019s not a\nthird party in the mix because, especially for someone\u2019s very personal\ninformation, you don\u2019t want a third party involved.\n\nQ: It seems like the internet business model is shifting a bit, too, and\npeople are willing to pay for this technology in a way that they were not in\n1.0 and 2.0. Do you think that\u2019s true?\n\nA: I\u2018ll give you an analogy and a story. When I was at Google, we got very\ninterested in personalized search. When you search for an engine, we know that\nyou\u2019re interested in cars, where someone else might be interested in planes or\ndifferent train engines, or what have you. So we were like how can we make\nthis more personalized for people?\n\nSo we did an acquisition and it was a company called Kaltix. They came in, we\nlooked at all kinds of different things we could use to personalize your\nsearch, where you live and what you\u2019re an expert in to the extent we had the\nability to look at that. We looked at all these different factors and then we\nlooked at our overall search happiness and search satisfaction with results.\nAnd what do you think performed best? If you only get one thing to personalize\nsomeone\u2019s search, what\u2019s the one thing that\u2019s most useful?\n\nQ: I have no idea. Tell me.\n\nA: The search you just did. If I type carburetor, and then I type engine I\u2019m\nprobably looking for an automobile engine, right? Or I\u2019m looking for something\nthat has to do with the carburetor. Those types of things. So it was kind of\nfascinating because more than where you live, more than what you\u2019re an expert\non, more than what you know, if you know the search they just did, you get the\nbest result.\n\nWhen you start to look at some of these subscriptions and sign up services,\nChatGPT is almost the same principle. If they know the AI tasks you were just\nworking on, they\u2019re going to be able to meet you where you are and help you\nmove it forward that much faster. It\u2019s funny because even in our invitation,\nwe see that people have this tendency when they do prompts, as we\u2019re learning\nhow to help them do better prompts for their invitations. They\u2019ve even come to\nexpect, like make that one but with more red, that kind of iterative notion of\nbuilding off of where they already were.\n\nThat\u2019s something people are coming to expect from these AI technologies and\nchatbots. They want to be able to pick up the conversation where they left it\nor the task where they left it. That\u2019s among other reasons why it makes all\nthe sense in the world to have an account because you can do a good job with\nlimited history or with no history at all, just like Google did for years\nbefore it had personalized search. But the moment you have an element of\nhistory and that kind of longevity of getting to know someone, they\u2019re just\ngoing to be that much better.\n\nAnother unlock moment will happen in AI when we see these current AI models\nmeet personal information. Today, if you ask ChatGPT, \u2018What should I buy my\nnephew for his birthday next month?\u2019 They\u2019re like, \u2018Who is he? Where does he\nlive? How old is he?\u2019\n\nBut I think once you actually start to have a sense of people\u2019s personal\ninformation, personal relationships, personal preferences, and that comes to\nbear with a language model, or an image model that is strong and powerful,\nthat\u2019s when there\u2019ll be another big step up in terms of the unlock of what\npeople feel day today.\n\nQ: Do you think we\u2019ll get to this point where there is a model that\u2019s able to\nreally reason and consequently act as an agent for us and be reliable?\n\nA: The current models, which have some amount of reasoning in them but are\npretty limited in the philosophical sense, are doing well enough that I\u2019m not\nsure there\u2019s going to be that much pressure to do that type of reasoning. Over\ntime, it is a very intellectually interesting space and I do think that we\nwill see research advances there. But right now, with the current techniques\nand the current style of reasoning, the technology is getting us far enough\nthat I\u2019m not sure that type of causal reasoning model, which is pretty\ndifferent than the way these models are built today, is really called for and\nis really being driven towards that hard.\n\nQ: Do you do much angel investing and, if so, is there anything that\u2019s blown\nyour mind recently on the startup front?\n\nA: I do some angel investing, but it\u2019s pretty limited. Obviously, a lot of my\ninvestment in time and resources goes to Sunshine these days. I invested in a\ncompany called Halo AI a few years ago that is basically doing AI analysis,\nradiology images, and ultimately doing very early detection screens on things\nlike cancer and various conditions. I wanted to be a doctor for a long time\nwhen I was growing up. Those types of medical advances and medical\napplications always get me really excited.\n\nQ: It does seem like that area is so promising and drug discovery too. Do you\nenjoy the startup life, or is the corporate CEO life more fun?\n\nA: I love all phases of companies. I had a funny conversation with my mom,\nmany years ago, where she was talking about one of my friends who had just\nsaid, \u2018oh my gosh, 4 is my favorite age.\u2019 And afterwards, she said, \u2018I feel so\nbad for her because someday, she\u2019s going to have a 5-year-old.\u2019 And my mom was\nlike, \u2018I love all phases of my children.\u2019 And it was before I had children,\nbefore I was married, and I said, \u2018you know, Mom, I think I love all phases of\ncompanies.\u2019 I was like, \u2018I like it when they\u2019re small, when it\u2019s single\ndigits, double digits, triple, quadruple. I love it when I\u2019m an individual\ncontributor, I like managing small teams, big teams, teams of thousands. I\nlove the hypergrowth, I even love the challenge of turning around a company\nthat\u2019s in decline or a product line that is in decline. It\u2019s one of the\nrichest, most interesting intellectual and design problems you can work on. I\njust love building things. That\u2019s really what a company is about. It\u2019s about\nbuilding products, businesses, teams and cultures. That work and the way that\nall comes together is just truly fascinating.\n\nQ: You said you were going to be a doctor. And in a way, the human body is\nthis amazing system. Is a company similar to that?\n\nA: Maybe it\u2019s the fundamental engineering mindset. I just love systems. I love\nsymbolic systems and the way they support what is now modern day AI. That\u2019s a\nsystem, the system of cognition, the system of a body, I love the system of a\ncompany. I like thinking about really complicated systems and how to make them\nwork better. And that\u2019s what products are, too, whether it\u2019s a search engine\nor a photo sharing app like Shine. They\u2019re all complicated, interesting\nsystems that overall can be made to work better and more efficiently and have\na bigger impact.\n\nAD\n\n", "frontpage": false}
