It was easy for a pedestrian to stroll past her car and stay on the\nsidewalk. But she was still likely running a risk of getting ticketed under\nstate Vehicle Code Section 22500, which prohibits drivers from letting even a\nportion of their vehicles extend over the walkway.\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t she simply park the car in her garage?\n\nThat question was posed repeatedly about a Richmond neighborhood resident,\noften in less polite terms, after he went viral on X for crying foul over a\n$108 parking citation he received for partially blocking the sidewalk while\nmost of his Prius was sitting in his own driveway.\n\nThe reader response to The Standard\u2019s coverage of the controversy made it\nclear that this was not an isolated incident. Residents from across San\nFrancisco wrote in explaining that people in their neighborhoods habitually\ntry to stuff cars into too-short driveways, leaving part of their vehicles\nextending into the pedestrian walkway.\n\nWhat\u2019s behind this phenomenon of sidewalk blocking? The Standard hit the\nstreets of San Francisco\u2019s residential neighborhoods to find out, asking\ndriveway parkers blocking at least some of the sidewalk one simple question:\nWhy not put your vehicle in your garage?\n\nA person walked by a car jutting into a Richmond neighborhood sidewalk on Thursday. | Source: Paul Kuroda for The Standard\n\nThe answers ran the gamut, including the downsides of historical architecture,\nthe challenges of owning an electric vehicle and fear of car break-ins.\n\nLongtime practitioners of sidewalk blocking may be in for a rude awakening, as\nMayor London Breed has directed the San Francisco Municipal Transportation\nAgency to up enforcement of laws that ban obstructing sidewalks, blocking\ncrosswalks and parking too close to intersections. Those practices put\npedestrians and bicyclists at risk, especially people using wheelchairs or\nother devices to get around, by forcing them into the street, according to a\nMayor\u2019s Office spokesperson.\n\nBreed and other city leaders have placed renewed emphasis on street safety in\nthe wake of a crash that killed a family of four in March, a tragedy that\nhighlighted the city\u2019s failure to eliminate traffic deaths through its Vision\nZero initiative.\n\n## What\u2019s a reasonable amount to block the sidewalk?\n\nSo why doesn\u2019t Calcagno put her Bolt in the garage? Because her family\u2019s other\ncar was already occupying that single slot. While Calcagno normally street\nparks whichever car isn\u2019t in the garage, they\u2019re both electric vehicles and\nwere charging simultaneously on Wednesday, she explained. To charge her Bolt\nwhile street parking, she would have to stretch the charging cable across the\nsidewalk, creating a tripping hazard.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to get sued,\u201d Calcagno said.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t hate the idea of the city cracking down on vehicles that are\ncompletely blocking the sidewalk, but she wants officials to use discretion.\nSo long as there\u2019s space for a person using a wheelchair or walker to get by\non the sidewalk, the city should give parkers some grace, according to\nCalcagno.\n\n\u201cI think there needs to be some reasonableness,\u201d Calcagno said.\n\nMolly Calcagno\u2019s electric vehicle was parked in front of her home while charging on Wednesday, partially blocking the sidewalk. | Source: Noah Baustin The Standard\n\nThat was the consensus among the 10 sidewalk blockers The Standard\ninterviewed, all of whom had left at least some sidewalk space for pedestrians\nto navigate around.\n\nIssuing citations based on the letter of the sidewalk-blocking law\u2014instead of\nlooking the other way so long as a person in a wheelchair can get by\u2014is just\nanother example of the city screwing over working-class inhabitants, who may\nstruggle to pay pricey fines, according to a Sunset resident named Ted, who\ndeclined to give his last name.\n\n\u201cThings like that are just a ploy to get money out of people who are already\nworking too hard,\u201d Ted said.\n\nBut people without disabilities vastly underestimate how treacherous it can be\nto navigate all the obstacles on city sidewalks, according to Leslie Stepp.\nHer rheumatoid arthritis has forced her to walk with a cane, complicating\njourneys from her Pacific Heights home, Stepp said.\n\nThat\u2019s because she\u2019s often not the only person on the sidewalk. She may come\nacross dog walkers, people pushing strollers and more, leaving her wondering,\n\u201cHow am I going to get around this?\u201d A car jutting into the walkway makes that\nsituation all the more challenging.\n\nShe says she has fallen twice trying to get around cars poking into the\nsidewalk, once as a person pushing a stroller squeezed by simultaneously,\nforcing her onto the driveway decline, where she twisted her ankle and ended\nup on the ground.\n\nThat\u2019s why she has no sympathy for the idea that there is a reasonable amount\nof space that should be allowed for a car to encroach on the walkway.\n\n\u201cIf [people blocking the sidewalk] want to rationalize their way around it,\nthat\u2019s great, but they should still be ticketed,\u201d Stepp said. \u201cThe truth is,\nthe sidewalk is for people, not cars.\u201d\n\n## Why are these garages so small?\n\nDavid Jacoby, the Richmond neighborhood resident who kicked off the original\nparking controversy, said that he didn\u2019t park in his garage because his Prius\nsimply didn\u2019t fit.\n\nThat\u2019s not uncommon, according to longtime San Francisco building permit\nexpediter Jeremy Paul. Virtually every house west of Twin Peaks erected before\n1950 was built with a garage door that\u2019s too narrow for a modern car, Paul\nsaid. He\u2019s worked on many projects to widen garage doors so they can fit a\nTesla or a Range Rover.\n\nA row of cars blocked the sidewalk in the Richmond neighborhood on Thursday. | Source: Paul Kuroda for The StandardA person walks by a car partially obstructing the sidewalk in the Richmond District on Thursday. | Source: Paul Kuroda for The Standard\n\nMeanwhile, neighborhoods such as the Western Addition, Mission, Russian Hill\nand Noe Valley are chock full of homes built before everyday people owned\nautomobiles, according to San Francisco Heritage President Woody LaBounty.\nMany of these homes, constructed pre-1910, were built to have a half story of\nopen space underneath to get the house off the ground and away from the muddy,\nsandy streets of the era.\n\nOnce automobile ownership became commonplace, companies began turning those\nempty basement-level half-stories into garages, explaining why so many San\nFrancisco garages have steep declining driveways and shallow roofs, according\nto LaBounty. About a third of San Francisco homes were built before garages\nwere widespread, LaBounty estimates.\n\nMany of the driveway parkers The Standard spoke with had alternative uses for\ntheir garage space. One teen, who declined to give their name, explained that\ntheir family had converted the garage into a relaxation zone so they could\nhave a refuge from their younger siblings. David Turner, meanwhile, said he\nhad a home gym set up in the garage, outfitted with a bench press, squat rack,\nheavy bag and pull-up bar.\n\nTwo trucks block the sidewalk from both directions in a driveway in the Richmond District on Thursday. | Source: Paul Kuroda for The Standard\n\nOther driveway parkers, however, didn\u2019t even live in the attached home. Robyn\nTeisi commutes from the East Bay to San Francisco to work as a caregiver. She\nsaid she started parking in her client\u2019s driveway after her car was broken\ninto twice on city streets.\n\nTeisi was the only driver who cited security concerns. Many others, whether\ntheir garage was filled with another car or being used to store things, didn\u2019t\nsee parking inside as an option. As for why they chose to use their driveways\ninstead of street parking, there was a common thread.\n\nIt was summed up by the owner of a Blue Tesla who didn\u2019t want to share her\nname.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so I don\u2019t have to find a parking spot,\u201d she said.\n\nNoah Baustin can be reached at nbaustin@sfstandard.com\n\n## Filed Under\n\nCarsLifeNewsSFMTATransportation\n\n## Read More\n\n  * ### The $2 billion Central Subway has lots of leaks, few riders\n\nThere's an ongoing battle against leaks in San Francisco's new $2 billion\nCentral Subway.\n\n  * ### Oakland just changed its airport name.
