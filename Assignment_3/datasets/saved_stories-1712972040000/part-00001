Employees can fire up the grill for some Argentine asado\nbarbecue, play pingpong, hit the gym or even ride a mechanical bull.\n\nBut workers don\u2019t have to be there. Globant Chief Executive Officer Martin\nMigoya is choosing not to adopt a return-to-office policy for his nearly\n30,000 employees across 33 countries, making the software giant one of the\nworld\u2019s largest tech companies by headcount to remain fully remote.\n\nIt\u2019s not that Migoya doesn\u2019t appreciate in-person work. He\u2019s been adding\noffice space post-pandemic and employees are coming back, he said in an\ninterview with Bloomberg Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait. But it has\nhappened \u201cwithout putting a gun to the head of anybody,\u201d he said.\n\nMigoya said his initial impulse was: \u201cLet\u2019s make everybody come back.\u201d But\nhe\u2019s settled on a softer sell that includes making offices more flexible and\nwelcoming. \u201cWe found that people come, they get together, they use our offices\nin a different way, and we\u2019ve been modifying our offices to attend to that new\nreality,\u201d he said.\n\nMigoya\u2019s teams redesigned the offices post-pandemic, replacing individual\ndesks with more round tables that fit several people, while creating extra\nlounge space and phonebooth-style work stations for private meetings.\n\nRead More: New York City\u2019s Return-to-Office Rate Nears 80%, Driven by Banks\n\nGlobant\u2019s lack of return-to-office policy contrasts with the approach of Apple\nInc., Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc., which\nhave all adopted policies to bring employees back to their desks. Even\ne-commerce behemoth MercadoLibre Inc., which was also founded in Argentina,\nrequires its managers to spend 20% of their time in the office per quarter,\naccording to a spokeswoman.\n\nIn the US, where Globant has seven offices, businesses are seeing attendance\nrates at 63% of pre-pandemic levels. New York and Miami lead the pack, with\nlevels near 80%. San Francisco lags behind other major US metro areas at 45%,\naccording to Placer.ai\u2019s Nationwide Office Building Index.\n\nRead More: Globant Beefs Up Creative Operations by Purchasing Ad Firm GUT\n\nGlobant, whose clients include the NBA\u2019s Los Angeles Clippers, is in the early\nstages of hiring another 20,000 employees over the next five years as part of\na $1 billion investment. The company, headquartered in Montevideo, Uruguay,\nalso continues to open up office space beyond its large hub in Buenos Aires.\nLast year, it inaugurated a location in Tandil, a farming town three hours\nsouth of the capital that had little tech presence before.\n\n\u201cWe have been very flexible; we will continue being very flexible,\u201d Migoya\nsaid in the interview. \u201cThe office must be an attraction point for the people\nto get together, rather than just the desk in which you do your job. It\u2019s a\nconnection engine for the company.\u201d\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\n### FAANG stocks\n\n  * 2:05\n\n5 things you need to know for the trading day\n\n  * 6:52\n\nMeta has lost consumer trust, favour Alphabet and Amazon for FANG buys right\nnow: Hatem Dhiab\n\n  * 5:10\n\nStay away from the FAANG, but remain invested in tech: Strategist\n\n  * 3:57\n\nDarren Sissons discusses the FAANG stocks and Microsoft\n\n  * 5:40\n\nAmazon breakout would be a 'really big deal': Fairlead Strategies founder\nKatie Stockton\n\n  * 6:33\n\nInvestors to see 'nothing but blowout earnings' for this quarter: Belpointe's\nDavid Nelson\n\n  1.
