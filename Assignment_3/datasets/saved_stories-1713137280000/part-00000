The ZiG will replace the Zimbabwean dollar, which lost three-quarters of its value this year. Meanwhile, the country saw a 55% inflation peak in March this year. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Governor John Mushayavanhu says that a structured approach with a market-determined exchange rate will help stabilise the new currency. Zimbabweans have 21 days to exchange old notes. However, the US dollar, used in 85% of transactions in the country, still remains legal tender. ZiG banknotes range from 1 to 200 denominations. --- Zimbabwe | New Currency | Gold-Backed Money | Zimbabwe Dollar | Economy | Firstpost | News Live | World News | Latest News | Global News | International News | News | Trending News #zimbabwe #newcurrency #goldbackedmoney #zimbabwedollar #economy #firstpost #newslive #worldnews #latestnews #globalnews #news #internationalnews #trendingnews Firstpost is an Indian news and media website.
