A lot of people thought we were out\nof our minds. But we believed in the power and potential of these machines to\nchange the world. So every day, we came to work determined to make it happen.\nNow, it\u2019s hard to imagine the world any other way. In a few short decades,\nthat goal became reality for billions.\n\nIn 1990, the possibility that the world would be able to cut child mortality\nin half over the next thirty years would have seemed just as remote. But\nthat\u2019s exactly what happened. And I believe the world can do it again by\n2040\u2014we can cut child mortality in half once more\u2014and get even closer to\nending all preventable child deaths.\n\nMy introduction to this issue came 27 years ago, when I read a piece in the\nNew York Times about deadly drinking water in the world\u2019s poorest countries\nthat contained the following statistic: \u201cDiarrhea kills some 3.1 million\npeople annually, almost all of them children.\u201d Learning that shocked me to my\ncore. There\u2019s no greater pain than the death of a child. The death of millions\nof them\u2014from something easily treatable in much of the world\u2014is tragedy after\ntragedy on an almost unfathomable scale.\n\nBefore long, I was learning everything I could about global health generally\nand child mortality specifically. And shortly after, the Gates Foundation,\nwhich was just getting off the ground, made it our mission to fight\npreventable health disparities like this around the world\u2014with an emphasis on\nchildren whose lives were being cut short before they ever had a chance.\n\nWe had phenomenal partners in that effort across governments, in the private\nsector, and from foundations and organizations that share our mission. And by\n2019, something remarkable had happened\u2014what I consider to be one of the most\nimportant things humanity has ever achieved: In under three decades, child\nmortality was cut by more than half. (For more about how this happened, and\nall the partners who deserve credit, see my blog post from two years ago.)\n\nMeasles deaths fell 90 percent thanks to vaccines. Pneumonia deaths fell 70\npercent, also thanks to vaccines. Deaths from diarrhea\u2014which killed 3 million\nkids a year not too long ago\u2014fell 70 percent, too, thanks to low-tech\ninterventions like oral rehydration solution, large-scale sanitation programs,\nand (yes, you guessed it) a new rotavirus vaccine. Malaria deaths fell 36\npercent thanks to effective bed nets and sprays. Even deaths from HIV, which\nmore than tripled as a killer of kids in the 1990s, fell 33 percent once we\nfigured out how to protect and treat mothers so they don\u2019t pass the virus on\nto their babies.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the child mortality rates from these diseases that went down,\nthough. Year after year, the raw number of overall childhood deaths fell\u2014even\nas the global population rose\u2014from 12 million in 1990 to five million in 2019.\n\nWe\u2019ve made incredible progress, and we keep moving in the right direction. But\nwe aren\u2019t moving fast enough. Just under five million kids still die each year\nbefore reaching their fifth birthday. Another two million are stillborn.\nVirtually all of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries\u2014and\nevery single one is a tragedy that devastates families and entire communities.\n\nMy blog post from two years ago told the first part of this story\u2014explaining\nwhat we know about child mortality and what we did to cut it in half once\nbefore. This is part two: how we can cut child mortality in half again, to\nbelow three million deaths a year by 2040.\n\nThe main reason I believe we can do this is because we already have most of\nthe tools we need. As we shared in last year\u2019s Goalkeepers Report,\n\u201cResearchers have learned more about the health of mothers and babies over the\npast 10 years than they did in the century before that.\u201d While continued\ninnovation is always necessary, we currently have the know-how to save\nmillions of lives\u2014it\u2019s a matter of putting it to use and making sure it\nreaches the children who need it most.\n\nThat begins before children even take their first breaths. It begins with\nmothers.\n\nWhen a mother dies during childbirth, her child has a more than 63 percent\nchance of dying before their first birthday. To save those kids\u2019 lives\u2014and so\nmany others by 2040\u2014we need to focus on keeping women healthy before and\nthroughout pregnancy, so they can deliver and raise healthy children.\n\n## Stop women from bleeding to death after childbirth\n\nAround the world, postpartum hemorrhage (PPH)\u2014defined by the WHO as losing\nmore than half a liter of blood within 24 hours of childbirth\u2014is the primary\ncause of maternal mortality. Often, it isn\u2019t caught until it\u2019s too late,\nbecause it\u2019s hard to know how much blood loss is too much.\n\nBut with a low-cost tool called a calibrated obstetric drape and a trained\nbirth attendant monitoring it, blood loss can be accurately measured in real\ntime. By bundling five interventions that stop the bleeding and administering\nthem simultaneously rather than sequentially\u2014an approach known as\nE-MOTIVE\u2014healthcare workers can slash cases of severe bleeding by 60 percent.\nBy screening for and treating anemia, a common cause of PPH, during pregnancy,\nthe world can prevent some PPH cases entirely.\n\n## Prevent life-threatening infections during labor\n\nSepsis\u2014a life-threatening condition in which the immune system overreacts to\nan infection, causing widespread inflammation and organ damage\u2014is another\ncommon cause of maternal mortality. In the U.S., it\u2019s responsible for 23\npercent of cases. But researchers have recently discovered that azithromycin,\none of the world\u2019s most common antibiotics, can reduce sepsis cases by a third\nwhen given preventatively. This discovery will be lifesaving for mothers\u2014and\ntherefore babies\u2014especially in places where many women give birth at home, in\nconditions that aren\u2019t necessarily sterile.\n\n## Speed up the development of babies\u2019 lungs\n\nWhen babies are born pre-term, before 37 weeks of pregnancy, their organs are\nstill under-developed\u2014especially the lungs, one of the last organs to finish\ngrowing inside the womb. That leaves these babies vulnerable to a whole host\nof potentially fatal complications. But now, if doctors learn a mother is at\nrisk of going into pre-term labor, they can prescribe her antenatal\ncorticosteroids that help her baby\u2019s lungs grow as much as they would over a\nfew weeks\u2014in just a few days.\n\n## Fight malnutrition before and after birth\n\nWithout a healthy microbiome\u2014the universe of bacteria inside the gut\u2014babies\nstruggle to absorb the nutrients in breast milk no matter how much they\u2019re\nfed. That malabsorption is doubly destructive because it can lead to\nmalnutrition, which can leave babies more susceptible to contracting and dying\nfrom pneumonia.\n\nWhile experts used to believe that malnutrition could only be treated at\naround six months\u2014once a baby starts eating solid foods\u2014we now know that the\nmicrobiomes of mothers and babies are connected. That means micronutrient\nsupplements can be given to pregnant women; when they are, babies gain an\nadditional 5 grams of weight each day during the late stages of pregnancy and\nare more likely to be born with a healthy gut.\n\nAnd when a baby is born underweight or pre-term, probiotic powders that\ninclude bifidobacteria can be added to breast milk to improve their digestive\nsystem, help them absorb nutrients, and reduce their risk of contracting\nsevere infections and dying.\n\nThe focus, with each of these interventions, is on the beginning of a newborn\nbaby\u2019s life (and the lead-up to it). Why? Because half of all deaths of\nchildren under five occur in the first 28 days. If a baby is born healthy and\nsurvives that first month, the odds increase dramatically that they will live\nto see their fifth birthday\u2014and then onto adulthood. Making this happen will\nrequire renewed investments by governments and organizations around the world\nto get these life-saving interventions out to the people and places where\nthey\u2019re so sorely needed. But it doesn\u2019t require much new invention. Again:\nThe solutions to cut child mortality in half again already exist. (And they\u2019re\nall low-cost.)\n\nOf course, there\u2019s still much more to do to eliminate preventable deaths of\nchildren altogether. We need to continue improving sanitation and increasing\naccess to clean drinking water around the world. We need to develop a vaccine\nfor HIV and next-generation malaria vaccines to really stop them in their\ntracks; as we saw over the last 30 years, diseases with effective vaccines\ndeclined much faster than those we try to control without them.\n\nWe also need to ramp up vaccine distribution efforts, with an emphasis on\nreaching the 60 million \u201czero-dose\u201d kids in lower-income countries who\u2019ve\nnever received a single immunization and now make up half of all childhood\ndeaths from diseases with effective vaccines. These numbers spiked during the\npandemic, when routine immunizations were disrupted and vaccine misinformation\nsurged. Fortunately, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance\u2014which has helped vaccinate\nover 981 million children in the world\u2019s poorest countries since 2000\u2014is\nworking around the clock to reach these kids. The organization will be having\nits next replenishment cycle soon, and the more money raised, the more lives\nsaved. I often say that giving to Gavi is the best investment I\u2019ve ever made.\n\nNone of this work is easily accomplished. Most goals worth achieving aren\u2019t,\nthough, especially one as important as this. But with the right commitment, I\nthink preventable child deaths will one day be as unimaginable to us as life\nwithout computers. And in the not-too-distant future, a world where all\nchildren have the same chance to survive and thrive\u2014no matter where they\u2019re\nborn\u2014will become reality, too.\n\nRead this next\n\nNEXT\n\nCould a grain older than the wheel be the future of food?\n\nLost crops like fonio could help us fight climate change and malnutrition.\n\nI found inspiration in India\n\nHere are a few pictures from my latest visit to this amazing country.\n\nIndia's innovations are still changing the world\n\nI\u2019m excited to see the latest breakthroughs during my visit this week.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThank you for being part of the Gates Notes Insider community.\n\nNot seeing your comment?
