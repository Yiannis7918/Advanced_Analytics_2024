There's a lot in our society that pushes towards\nmothers having primary responsibility for kids, and it can be a very easy rut\nto fall into even if it's not what you want.\n\nPregnancy and birth are very asymmetric, and then breastfeeding continues the\npattern: nursing isn't going to be equitable. This means night feedings, more\nability to calm the baby, and even just her smelling more familiar to them.\nWhile this asymmetry isn't permanent, it pushes you towards starting with an\nunequal division.\n\nThen with parental leave it's very common for the mother to take more time off\nwork than the father. Many jobs give more leave to birth parents, and someone\nwho has just given birth often needs substantial recovery time. Fathers\ncommonly earn more than mothers and so if leave is unpaid many couples can\nafford more if the mother takes it than if the father does.\n\nIf you're the dad, what can you do? I see two main aspects: sharing the work,\nand sharing the parenting.\n\nFrom a work perspective, in as much as you want to be trying to make things\nfair you should be making up for the things you can't do by taking on more of\nthe remaining work: non-feeding care, diapers, cooking, etc. Sleeping\nelsewhere sometimes so you have more energy and be more alert the next day can\nwork well, as can taking the baby early in the morning so the mother can sleep\nin.\n\nThe other aspect is you want to be dividing the parenting, not just the work.\nThis is because you really need to avoid a situation where the mother has a\nmuch better understanding of the baby than you do. For example, you can get\ninto a cycle where you can't calm the baby as well, they spend more time with\ntheir mother, you get less experience and practice with them, and your\nrelative abilities with the baby get farther and farther apart.\n\nHaving time when you're watching the baby solo is pretty valuable: you get\npractice much faster and your kid can't just insist on their preferred parent.\nMy work gives (a very generous by US standards) twelve weeks of leave, which I\ntook each time as two weeks at birth and ten after Julia went back to work.\nHaving that time with the kids was great, both because I like them a lot but\nalso because all that solo time set me on good footing for equal parenting\nlater.\n\nWe've also found it useful to think through all the different aspects of\nparenting, both ones that take time and ones that take mental effort, and\nthink about who's been doing them: when you go out who remembers to bring\ndiapers, spare clothes, food? Who keeps track of medical appointments? Who\ndoes their baths? Who gets up in the night if they're crying? Who puts them to\nbed? Who arranges childcare? Splitting each individual task 50-50 loses a lot\nto coordination costs (more), but you can still split the tasks overall.\n\nOne pitfall here is that people will often assume that the mother is in charge\nof things related to the kids, and so judge her if they're not done well. If I\nwere charge of the kids having clothes that are the right size and I didn't do\na good job, other people wouldn't know that this was my responsibility.\n\nWhile it doesn't cover everything, we've also found time tracking to be useful\nin checking that we're approximately balancing overall work (example). We'll\ntake a representative couple weeks, see how our time shakes out, and compare.\n\nOne frame that can be useful is, if the mother had to suddenly take a 3-week\ntrip, would you be ok with the kids on your own? If not, why not? Can you get\nto where you would be ok?\n\nAnother frame I've found useful is one I'm hesitant to describe: since people\noften get advice that's the opposite of what they should hear, consider that\nthis might not be right for you. I've found trying to do substantially more of\nthe parenting work to be a useful approach. This doesn't mean that I actually\nend up doing substantially more than my share, but if I were shooting for 50%\nI would likely fall short.\n\nOverall, this is hard both because parenting is a lot of work but also because\nthere's not much of an equal parenting script to go on. Chances are both\nparents grew up in households where the mother was responsible for more of the\nchildcare, and models of balanced parenting are hard to find. Our division\nisn't perfect, but I hope thinking about some of this helps you end up being\nmore the kind of parent and spouse you want to be.\n\n\u2190\n\nTen Years Beantown Stomp: Low Fragrance\n\n\u2192\n\nComment via: facebook, lesswrong\n\nKitty (5y, via fb):link\n\nThis is a great write up. Thank you for sharing Jeff.\n\nAri (5y, via fb):link\n\nWe split by evening; Sophie is on duty Tues and Sunday, I\u2019m on duty mon and\nweds. The other days we are both around This also enforces the norm that both\nparents can cope solo.\n\nMichael (5y, via fb):link\n\nSince Vera as clergy works a lot of nights and weekends, it's done a really\ngood job of enforcing a more even parenting split. The downside, of course, is\nthat we don't get enough time together.\n\nMichael (5y, via fb):link\n\nEli\u0161ka Hah! You're making me think that \"Parent MWF\" and \"Parent TThSa\" might\nbe a way to go for some things!\n\nEli\u0161ka (5y, via fb):link\n\nRe: contact info - this obviously doesn't work for all situations, but one of\nthe places I've worked had contacts listed as \"parent 1\" and \"parent 2\", where\nparent 1 was who we should contact first.\n\nJeff Kaufman (5y, via fb):link\n\n\"I'd expect there to be significant value to splitting individual tasks just\nfor cross-training\"\n\nThe FB version doesn't have the link, but in the original I link to\nhttps://www.jefftk.com/p/dividing-tasks here which has a bit more on this. I\nthink for any parenting task that you would expect to come up in say a 1-month\nperiod it's good to have both people do it some. Even though I usually put the\nkids to bed, if Julia never did it then it would be really hard for me ever to\nbe out at night.\n\nOn the other hand, Julia handles the kids clothing (washing, mending, making\nsure there are going to be things for them to wear as they get bigger,\nhandling receiving and distributing hand-me-downs among friends/family,\nfinding things at the thrift store) and when she's away most of this can just\nbe on hold until she's back (pretty much everything except the washing). So\nthe reduced need for coordination (\"I didn't realize you had already bought a\nnew coat for Lily\", \"why did you give Sam the baby shoes I had told Pat they\ncould have?\") is really worth it.\n\nIt's also pretty good for one-off tasks. I handled potty training for both\nkids, and we did it in a short intensive way where having one person fully\ntake it on was way more efficient. And what they needed from us changed\nrapidly (daily) so the benefit of cross-training would have been very low.\n\n\"One specific situation where I'd appreciate advice is in giving other people\ncontact information.\"\n\nDaycare was long enough ago (https://www.jefftk.com/p/childcare-ii) that I\ndon't remember how this worked. There are probably some cases where it's\neasier to just go along with society and find other places where the dad can\ndo more to make up for it?\n\nWang (5y, via fb):link\n\nThank you for writing about a topic I've given a lot of thought recently.\nYou're correct, and it's so unfortunate, that a lot of factors often make it\ngenuinely easier for the mother to do the majority of the childcare. I wish we\ndidn't have to pay a premium for equal parenting.\n\n\"Splitting each individual task 50-50 loses a lot to coordination costs\"\n\nThis is true, but I'd expect there to be significant value to splitting\nindividual tasks just for cross-training. As you say, it's important that\neither parent be able to take full control if the other one becomes\nunavailable, whether for something as benign as a long trip or for something\nmore dire. How do you handle such situations, if you are splitting by task?\n\n\"people will often assume that the mother is in charge of things\"\n\nOne specific situation where I'd appreciate advice is in giving other people\ncontact information. One might expect the thing to do would be to give\ninformation for both parents, but I've heard that this results in people\nexclusively communicating with the mother. Apparently, if you want the father\ninvolved at all, you have to withhold access to the mother. But that's paying\na steep price in redundancy, because what if the father isn't immediately\navailable?\n\n\"models of balanced parenting are hard to find\"\n\nYeah, this is something I'm trying keep in mind. My father wasn't around much,\nbecause we needed all the overtime he could get. Sometimes he'd even bring\nhome piece-work so that we could do the easy steps for him at the kitchen\ntable. Fortunately, I married up by quite a bit (my wife makes websites,\nformerly for Google) so there won't be the same financial incentive in my\nmarriage.\n\nMaggie (5y, via fb):link\n\nHugh Yeman, Jeff made this a public post, so I am alerting you, and I think\nyou might find it useful.\n\nGianna (5y, via fb):link\n\nYou have just written, nearly verbatim, a conversation that Keith and I have\nhad in our household since before we had kids. One additional thing that I\nthink is worth considering: as with other societal/cultural biases, I think\nthe work also needs to be taken on by the \"default\" group. This means male-\nidentified people taking an active role in countering sexism, white people\ntaking an active role in countering racism, straight people taking an active\nrole in countering homophobia, AND mothers taking an active role in countering\nparenting bias. It's dads' responsibility too, of course, in all the ways you\ndescribe. But I've seen over and over again is an unwillingness on the part of\nmothers to give up any of the associated control, domain expertise, and\n(pride? bragging rights?) that comes from being the default parent. Even if\nthat control and expertise is gained at the expense of other things. I cannot\ncount the number of times, when I was a new mom attending mother/baby\ngatherings, that I heard other mothers lament how they \"couldn't possibly\nleave the baby alone\" with dad because of what amounted to not trusting dad to\nhandle things or figure things out, or an expectation that they as the mom\nwould still get to call the shots. It was a really interesting dynamic to\nobserve, and one I have to pay attention to in myself as well.\n\nDaniel (5y, via fb):link\n\nSame! <3 <3 <3\n\nAnna (5y, via fb):link\n\ni love this a hundred million hearts\n\nPavel (5y, via fb):link\n\nSame here, we don't share tasks, we split them up. Wife does toothbrushing, I\ndo story. I do dishes and cat litter, she does cooking. Etc., etc.\n\nJeff Kaufman (5y, via fb):link\n\nWe've also found it really useful to be careful not to make commitments on\nbehalf of the other. I won't tell the kids that Julia will read to them, she\nwon't start a project with them and expect me to finish it with them when she\nleaves, etc.\n\nJeff Kaufman (5y, via fb):link\n\nI think the main way we've tried to handle situations like this is separating\ntasks and stopping coordinating on them. So, on normal days I do bedtime with\nboth kids, and Julia works or has alone time. Or, Julia lined up our Au Pairs,\nand I trusted her judgement.\n\nDenise (5y, via fb):link\n\nI feel like what often happens with Alexander and me is that we do share tasks\nand then barely save any time due to coordination costs. We both get invested\ninto our different preferences on how to do things and spend way too much time\njust discussing them, nevermind handoffs. I have no idea how to fix this.\n\nMartin (5y, via fb):link\n\nThank you for your thoughtfulness on this and many other subjects!\n\nGunnar_Zarncke (3y, via lw):link\n\n> It's pretty common for a male-female couple to be intellectually on board\n> with the idea of splitting the work of parenting equally\n\nWhich implies that would be the one true thing to do. It sure is the thing\nsociety seems to tell everybody. I think it does serve as a kind of default\nsolution or fairness standard. But each individual solution may differ a lot.\n50/50 often just isn't the most effective solution either. The 'classical'\nmodel of bread-winner and child-care-taker may still work well for some (and I\nhave talked to couples where a woman is the bread-winner). A wide spectrum of\nmodels has become available and that comes with its own strengths and\nweaknesses. Mostly it means a lot of talking or negotiation.\n\nAs a specific example of a model that is neither classic nor 50/50 take our\nmodel: My now ex-wife and I split parenting time about 60/40 and parenting\neffort maybe 75/25. The kids stay a lot of time at my place these days but the\nyoungest is 10 now and rules are more relaxed here. Remote work is really a\nbig plus. It is great to stay in contact with them every day - even if they\njust drop by to say hello or wave at colleagues while I'm in a video call. The\nmain effort of parenting is really with their mother: Taking care of homework,\nshuttling to courses, doctors appointments, and whatnot. A full-time mom who\nis also a qualified science teacher worked really well during lockdown. My\nkids benefited from it school-wise - and liked it much better. And it is\nefficient with four kids. I am super grateful for her work and I believe our\nparenting agreement is equitable.\n\nAnother data point that I found interesting is The Couple That Pays Each Other\nto Put Kids to Bed.\n\njefftk (3y, via lw):link\n\nSorry, yes, I wasn't trying to say that splitting things 50/50 is the only\nacceptable way to do things. I meant more like, there are a lot of people who,\nintellectually, want to be splitting things 50/50, but don't end up doing\nanything close to that.\n\nEDIT: rephrased the introduction to remove \"on board\"\n\nGunnar_Zarncke (3y, via lw):link\n\nYeah, it is a complex topic. It is related to the general pattern that if one\nparty has even slightly higher standards they can end up being responsible for\nit almost always. Simply because they start to reach their mental threshold\nbefore the other party does or by mechanisms of practicing it more and getting\nbetter at it. For example, cleaning the kitchen. I have no aversion to it and\nconsider it relaxing to do but I'm also fine with more stuff lying around. But\nmy ex-wife and also my oldest son prefer it more orderly. If we don't come to\nsome agreement you can guess what happens. It can easily feel unfair that they\n'have to' do it always. And such things can evolve dynamically with a growing\nfamily or otherwise changing circumstances.\n\nViliam (3y, via lw):link\n\nI make twice as much money as my wife, which means that she was able to stay\nat home for six years, we were able to pay our bills and even save some money.\nIf we tried it the other way round, perhaps we would be able to pay our bills,\nbut would have zero financial slack, which sounds like a problem waiting to\nhappen. Working part-time... well, for my wife it took a phone call to her\ncurrent job and they agreed... but for me, it is an unachievable dream that I\nactually tried long before having kids. The employers want to see passion and\ndedication to the job, and nothing kills this signal faster than saying \"I\nwould like to work part-time\". (Even when I filter job offers by \"also allows\npart-time\", at interview I am inevitably told that this option is only for\nwomen returning from their maternal leave... and in a year they are expected\nto switch to full-time anyway.) So, this removes the option of \"everyone does\n50% of everything\".\n\nTo avoid the situation \"father completely clueless when left with kids alone\",\nour arrangement (pre-Covid) was that my wife leaves me alone with kids on\nSaturday. Of course that is far from 50% share, but it achieves the goal of\nkids knowing that both parents are there for everything.\n\n### Recent posts on blogs I like:\n\n#### How Does Fiction Affect Reality?\n\nSocial norms\n\nvia Thing of Things April 19, 2024\n\n#### Clarendon Postmortem\n\nI posted a postmortem of a community I worked to help build, Clarendon, in\nCambridge MA, over at Supernuclear.\n\nvia Home March 19, 2024\n\n#### How web bloat impacts users with slow devices\n\nIn 2017, we looked at how web bloat affects users with slow connections.
