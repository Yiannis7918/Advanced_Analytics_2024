It also introduces Spam-T5, a modified Flan-T5 model which\nsignificantly outperforms other models.\n\n### Abstract\n\nThis paper investigates the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in\nemail spam detection by comparing prominent models from three distinct\nfamilies: BERT-like, Sentence Transformers, and Seq2Seq. Additionally, we\nexamine well-established machine learning techniques for spam detection, such\nas Na\u00efve Bayes and LightGBM, as baseline methods. We assess the performance of\nthese models across four public datasets, utilizing different numbers of\ntraining samples (full training set and few-shot settings). Our findings\nreveal that, in the majority of cases, LLMs surpass the performance of the\npopular baseline techniques, particularly in few-shot scenarios. This\nadaptability renders LLMs uniquely suited to spam detection tasks, where\nlabeled samples are limited in number and models require frequent updates.\nAdditionally, we introduce Spam-T5, a Flan-T5 model that has been specifically\nadapted and fine-tuned for the purpose of detecting email spam. Our results\ndemonstrate that Spam-T5 surpasses baseline models and other LLMs in the\nmajority of scenarios, particularly when there are a limited number of\ntraining samples available.\n\n### Installation\n\nAll Python packages needed are listed in requirements.txt. You can install\nthem with the following commands:\n\n    \n    \n    git clone https://github.com/jpmorganchase/llm-email-spam-detection.git cd llm-email-spam-detection python -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate pip install -r requirements.txt --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116\n\n### Usage\n\nAll source code used to generate the results and figures in the paper are in\nthe src folder. The data used in this paper is automatically downloaded,\nprocessed, and stored in the data folder.\n\nYou can start training the 6 baseline techniques and 3 large language models\nwith the following command:\n\n    \n    \n    python main.py\n\n### Maintenance Level\n\nThis repository is maintained to fix bugs and ensure the stability of the\nexisting codebase.
