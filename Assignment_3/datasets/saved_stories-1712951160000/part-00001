A Coast Guard rescue center in Guam began a search, but had\nchallenges due to weather and the availability of resources. A Navy aircraft\nstationed in Japan and the Coast Guard ship, Oliver Henry, then joined the\nmission.\n\nCrews searched an area of more than 78,000 square nautical miles, and the Navy\naircraft spotted the trio's palm leaf message the following day.\n\n### Strange News\n\n### Stranded Mariners Rescued From Island In Micronesia, Thanks To 'SOS'\nEtched In Sand\n\n\"This act of ingenuity was pivotal in guiding rescue efforts directly to their\nlocation,\" said Lt. Chelsea Garcia, the search and rescue mission coordinator.\n\nAircraft crews deployed a radio and other supplies down, and the men said they\nhad food and water, were in good health and had their boat, though it was\ndamaged. On Tuesday, the men were returned to Polowat.\n\n\"Whether we're out there protecting valuable resources or saving lives, we're\nnot just visitors \u2013 we're members of this vibrant maritime community that\nconnects all these islands,\" said Lt. Ray Cerrato, the commanding officer of\nUSCGC Oliver Henry. \"This recent operation near Pikelot Atoll hits home the\nkind of difference we can make. It's about more than just performing a duty;\nit's about the real human connections we forge and the lives we touch.\"\n\n  * coast guard\n  * rescue\n\n###### Read & Listen\n\n  * Home\n  * News\n  * Culture\n  * Music\n  * Podcasts & Shows\n\n###### Connect\n\n  * Newsletters\n  * Facebook\n  * Instagram\n  * Press\n  * Public Editor\n  * Corrections\n  * Contact & Help\n\n###### About NPR\n\n  * Overview\n  * Diversity\n  * NPR Network\n  * Accessibility\n  * Ethics\n  * Finances\n\n###### Get Involved\n\n  * Support Public Radio\n  * Sponsor NPR\n  * NPR Careers\n  * NPR Shop\n  * NPR Events\n  * NPR Extra\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy\n  * Your Privacy Choices\n  * Text Only\n  * \u00a9 2024 npr\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor\n\n## Cookie Consent & Sponsorship Choices\n\nWe and our 157 partners store and/or access information on a device, such as\nunique IDs in cookies to process personal data.
