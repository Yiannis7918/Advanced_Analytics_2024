The company has a complex system for paying staff, so it's\ncommon for internal debates to crop up when updates such as this happen.\n\nSome staff posted on Slack recently that they were seeing cuts of as much as\n20% to their projected total compensation.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an\nInsider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nStock awards are a major part of how Amazon pays workers, so actual\ncompensation can end up being different from projections. This is especially\ntrue when the company's shares are volatile. And this has certainly been the\ncase in recent years when the stock plunged and then surged back.\n\nAmazon typically bakes in a 15% increase in its stock price every year when\ncalculating future compensation. If the stock price instead jumps 100% in that\ntimeframe, actual pay will exceed projections.\n\nIn some of the messages viewed by BI, Amazon employees wrote that their\nprojected compensation for 2025 was less than the projections for 2024.\n\n\"I was surprised to see my projected total compensation for 2025 in my 2024\nPCS is about 10% less than my projected total compensation for 2024 in my 2023\nPCS. Why would that happen,\" one employee wrote in a Slack channel labeled\n\"pay equity discussion.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"PCS\" refers to the personal compensation statements that Amazon employees\nget.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson, Margaret Callahan, said that there had been no\ncompanywide shift in pay approach and that compensation was based on factors\nincluding type of job, location, level, and performance.\n\nOther Amazon employees on Slack complained of cuts as high as 20% in total\ncompensation, though the messages didn't say whether the drop was between\nactual or projected pay.\n\nOne concerned employee shared their own pay projections with BI showing a drop\nin projected pay between 2024 and 2025.\n\n\"Business Insider is cherry picking anecdotes from a handful of employees to\nfit their pre-determined narrative,\" Callahan said in a statement.\n\n\"Due to the growth in Amazon's stock price over the past year (approximately\n77%), many employees' compensation in 2024 will meaningfully exceed the amount\nthat the company planned for them to earn,\" she added.\n\nAre you a tech-industry employee, or do you have insight to share?\n\nContact the reporter Ashley Stewart via the encrypted messaging app Signal\n(+1-425-344-8242) or email (astewart@insider.com).\n\nRead next\n\n### Watch: How tech layoffs could affect the economy\n\nAmazon Amazon Web Services Cloud Computing\n\nMore...\n\nFollow us on:\n\n  * * Copyright \u00a9 2024 Insider Inc.
