It doesn't require extracting text\ninto JSON files, and allows shipping multi-language apps fast, using an AI-\npowered API.\n\nIt comes in two parts:\n\n  1. Replexica Compiler - an open-source compiler plugin for React;\n  2. Replexica API - an i18n API in the cloud that performs translations using LLMs. (Usage based, has a free tier.)\n\nReplexica supports several i18n formats:\n\n  1. JSON-free Replexica compiler format;\n  2. .md files for Markdown content;\n  3. Legacy JSON and YAML-based formats.\n\nLooking to jump right in? Check out the Getting Started guide for Next.js App\nRouter!\n\n## Why\n\nHaving built tens of side-projects / micro-startups over the years, we found\none thing to be particularly annoying: adding i18n to the app. We wanted to\nship, and ship fast, not to mess with JSON files or extraction scripts.\n\nSo it got us thinking: why not build a tool that makes multi-language apps\nsimpler? I mean, anyone who's tried to add i18n to their project knows it's a\nheadache.\n\nAnd after we found out ~80% aren't fluent in English - that seemed like a\nmissed opportunity, since i18n could be a shortcut to reaching more users, if\nonly it was easier.\n\nThat's why we teamed up build a React compiler coupled with an AI-powered API,\nto make i18n as simple as possible, at the most fundamental level.\n\n### Does Replexica work with ... ?\n\nPlease drop by our new Discord channel and ask! Our co-founder Max is online\nalmost 24/7.\n\n## Quick Start\n\nNote\n\nThis guide is for Next.js App Router apps only. Support for other setups is\ncoming soon (ETA April 2024). #25\n\nTo give a general idea behind Replexica, here's the only change that's needed\nto the basic Next.js app to make it multi-language:\n\n    \n    \n    // next.config.mjs // Import Replexica Compiler import replexica from '@replexica/compiler'; /** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */ const nextConfig = {}; // Define Replexica configuration /** @type {import('@replexica/compiler').ReplexicaConfig} */ const replexicaConfig = { locale: { source: 'en', targets: ['es'], }, }; // Wrap Next.js config with Replexica Compiler export default replexica.next( replexicaConfig, nextConfig, );\n\n## Getting Started\n\nWe've prepared a Getting Started guide that walks you through the process of\nsetting up Replexica Compiler with Next.js App Router. Check it out!\n\n## What's under the hood\n\nReplexica is a full-stack LLM-powered i18n tool for React, and it consists of\ntwo main parts:\n\n  1. Replexica i18n Compiler (this repo) - an open-source compiler plugin for React:\n\n     * Doesn't require extracting strings into JSON files;\n     * Seamlessly integrates with React build system;\n     * Infers metadata and user-facing text from the app;\n     * Prepares the content for further context-aware translation.\n\nThe compiler hooks into the build process, infers metadata from the app, such\nas the text that needs to be translated and the context it's in. The Abstract\nSyntax Tree (AST) is traversed to gather the metadata, the context, and the\ntext that needs to be translated. This metadata is then stored alongside the\nbuild artifacts.\n\n  2. Replexica i18n API (replexica.com) - an i18n API in the cloud that translates apps into multiple languages, using LLMs, fast:\n\n     * $0/mo + usage, with free tier; Entirely free, during the launch period;\n     * Full context awareness + brand voice;\n     * State-of-the-art quality translations (adding more new languages soon!) via a mix of open-source and proprietary AI models;\n     * API is open, so anyone could build their own translation engine (self-hosting guide coming soon).\n\nThe i18n engine uses AI to translate the text, and the more it's used, the\nbetter it gets. The very first version used plain gpt-3.5, though currently\nit's more like a mix of Llama + Google Vertex AI + GPT + Mixtral, and we're\nswitching between models regularly as we improve the API.\n\nThe core idea behind Replexica is simple: apps must be multi-language by\ndefault, from day one. The Internet is global, and so must be any software\nthat runs on it.\n\n## The Replexica Rule\n\nAt Replexica, we believe in the elegance of Convention over configuration\nprinciple.\n\nTherefore, there's one important rule to remember when using Replexica:\n\nAlways put translatable text inside JSX.\n\nAs long as you follow this rule, the Replexica Compiler will automatically\ninfer the metadata from your app and prepare the text inside JSX for\ntranslation.\n\nIf you don't follow the rule and decide to store some of your translatable\ncontent in variables, that can be translated too, but you'll need to manually\nwrap that text in a helper function.\n\nSo, if you want a hassle-free i18n on autopilot, follow The Replexica Rule\nwhenever possible.\n\n### Dynamic content\n\nThere's a common scenario, when you have an array of items that you render in\na list:\n\n    \n    \n    const menuItems = [ { title: 'Home', url: '/', }, { title: 'About', url: '/about', }, { title: 'Contact', url: '/contact', }, ];\n\nIn this case, you can still follow The Replexica Rule by simply wrapping the\ntext in JSX! Here's how:\n\n    \n    \n    const menuItesm = [ { title: <>Home</>, url: '/', }, { title: <>About</>, url: '/about', }, { title: <>Contact</>, url: '/contact', }, ];\n\nThe Replexica Compiler will automatically infer the metadata from the JSX and\nprepare the text for translation.\n\n## Roadmap\n\nHere are the main features we're working on next:\n\n  * Next.js - Replexica Compiler currently supports only Next.js App Router. Support for other setups is coming soon (ETA April 2024).\n  * New Languages - Replexica Cloud currently supports only English and Spanish. More languages are coming soon (ETA April 2024).\n\nThe more detailed roadmap is below:\n\n  * Replexica Compiler\n\n    * Next.js App Router\n    * Next.js Pages Router (April 2024)\n    * Remix (May 2024)\n    * Create React App (May 2024)\n  * Replexica Framework\n\n    * Core JSX translation\n    * Custom context hints\n    * Translation of JSX attributes (title, alt, placeholder)\n    * Translation of generic literals with helper functions\n    * Translation of arbitrary attributes\n  * Replexica Cloud\n\n    * AI Translation Engine\n    * Context awareness aka Brand voice\n    * Supported locales (production-ready, state-of-the-art quality)\n\n      * English\n      * Spanish\n      * French (April 2024)\n      * German (April 2024)\n      * 10+ more languages to be announced (June 2024)\n      * (Create a GitHub issue to request a new language!)\n    * Self-hosting guides / docs\n  * Replexica CLI\n\n    * CLI for Replexica Platform\n    * Open-source API schema\n    * GitHub Actions integration\n\n## Core Team\n\nWe're a lean team of two:\n\n  * Veronica - Product, Data Science, and LLMs.\n  * Max - React, Typescript, and Compilers.\n\nWe've also got a few (11 to be precise) contributors who signed up to help us\nwith the project, and we're always looking for more.
