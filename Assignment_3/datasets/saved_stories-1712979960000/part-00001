Credit: Physical Review Letters\n(2024). DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.151901\n\nThe BESIII collaboration have reported the observation of an anomalous line\nshape around ppbar mass threshold in the J/\u03c8\u2192\u03b33(\u03c0^+\u03c0^-) decay, which indicates\nthe existence of a ppbar bound state. The paper was published online in\nPhysical Review Letters.\n\nThe proximity in mass to 2m_p is suggestive of nucleon-antinucleon bound\nstates, an idea that has a long history. Before the birth of Quark Model, a\nnucleon-antinucleon bound state was already proposed by Prof. E. Fermi and\nProf. C. N. Yang.\n\nThere is an accumulation of evidence for anomalous behavior in the proton-\nantiproton system near the ppbar mass threshold, e.g., J/\u03c8\u2192\u03b3ppabr ,\nJ/\u03c8\u2192\u03b3\u03c0^+\u03c0^-\u03b7' and the proton's effective form factor determined from\ne^+e^-\u2192ppbar, exhibiting a narrow peak or a very steep falloff around the\nppbar mass threshold, which inspired many speculations and renewed the\ninterests on the nucleon-antinucleon bound state.\n\nX(1840) is a new structure discovered in the J/\u03c8\u2192\u03b33(\u03c0^+\u03c0^-) process in 2013\nwith subdata sample of BESIII experiment, which is also located near the ppbar\nmass threshold. A further exploration of line shape of X(1840) is essential to\nhave a better understanding of its nature. Therefore, the BESIII experiment\nperformed an investigation on the 3(\u03c0^+\u03c0^-) mass spectrum with 10 billion J/\u03c8\nevents, which is about 45 times larger than the subdata sample used in the\nprevious measurement.\n\nThe anomalous line shape of the resonant structure around ppbar mass threshold\nin 3(\u03c0+\u03c0-) mass spectrum. Credit: Physical Review Letters (2024). DOI:\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.151901\n\nAn anomalous line shape of X(1840) near the ppbar mass threshold was observed\nfor the first time. After many attempts, it was found that the model with a\ncoherent sum of two Breit-Wigner parameterizations could provide a good\ndescription of data, which revealed a new resonance X(1880) with a statistical\nsignificance greater than 10\u03c3, and the mass and width were determined to be\n1882.1\u00b11.7\u00b10.7 MeV/c^2 and 30.7\u00b15.5\u00b12.4 MeV/c, respectively.\n\nThe proximity of its mass to the ppbar mass threshold supported the existence\nof a ppbar bound state. After publication, this result was selected as\n\"Featured in Physics\" by Physical Review Letters.\n\nMore information: M.
