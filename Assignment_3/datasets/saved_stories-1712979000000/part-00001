The Memrise app is changing. This is the place\nto stay up to date with what's going on and how may affect you.\n\nMarch 27 2024 Memrise News & Events\n\nFollow this blog post for updates to the Memrise apps. We\u2019ll always update\nthis page first. Last updated: 27 March, 2024\n\n### Summary of changes\n\nEarlier this year we announced the retirement of community courses from the\nmain Memrise product. From the 31st of March of 2024, they will be moved to a\nseparate website and will no longer be accessible on memrise.com or the mobile\napps.\n\nThis change could affect you differently, depending on the courses you are\nlearning. Here, you\u2019ll find all the information you need to understand what\u2019s\ngoing on and what you need to do.\n\nIf you\u2019re already familiar with these changes and would like to head over to\nthe new Community Courses website, tap the button below.\n\nGo to Community Courses\n\n### Community courses moving\n\nCommunity courses are word lists but don't have any of the video content that\nword lists in the main Memrise product have. All non-language lists, like\nGeography or Biology, are community courses.\n\nAll community courses are moving to a new website: community-\ncourses.memrise.com This site is live and you can try it out now by clicking\nhere. After the 31st of March, 2024, none of these courses will be available\non memrise.com or the mobile apps.\n\nHow does this change affect you, and what do you need to do?\n\n  * Your existing login credentials will continue to work\n  * Your entire progress is available in the new website\n  * Course creation continues to be available\n\n### Community Courses FAQ\n\nQ: What is a community course?\n\nA: Community courses are word lists that let you learn facts and word\ntranslations, but don't have any of the video content that word lists in the\nmain Memrise product have. All non-language lists, like Geography or Biology,\nare community courses.\n\nQ: Will my Memrise login still work on the new web URL?\n\nA: Yes, the same login will continue to work\n\nQ: What will happen to my progress?\n\nA: It will be exported to the new web app experience, and none of the words or\nphrases you have learned will be lost.\n\nQ: When will you remove community courses from the apps?\n\nA: All community courses will be retired from memrise.com and the Memrise apps\non March 31st. 2024\n\nQ: When will you shut down this new URL? How long do I have to access my\ncommunity courses?\n\nA: Community courses will live in the new URL at least until the end of 2024\n\nQ: What will happen to my community courses after you shut the new site down?\n\nA: Before we do, we\u2019ll have a way to give you your word lists in a format that\nallows you to take them, and continue to learn them, somewhere else. After we\nshut down, they will still exist in this format for you.\n\nQ: Can I still create and share new courses with other users?\n\nA: Yes, you can create new courses and share them.\n\nQ: I upgraded to PRO. Are PRO features available in the new web app\nexperience?\n\nA: Yes, absolutely\n\nQ: Will I be able to access Community Courses on mobile apps?\n\nA: Community Courses will only be accessible on community-courses.memrise.com.\nThey won\u2019t be accessible via the Memrise app past March 31st 2024, but you can\nuse the new website in a mobile web browser and create a shortcut for it on\nyour mobile phone or tablet. You can find instructions on how to do this here\nfor Android, and over here for iOS.\n\nQ: I can\u2019t find some of the courses I was learning on memrise.com, where have\nthey gone?\n\nA: If they were official Memrise courses (e.g. Spanish 2) and not community\ncourses, they are only accessible on the main Memrise website and apps. The\nnew URL is only for community courses. More information on changes to official\ncourses is in the FAQ below.\n\nQ: Can I get to my community courses with the links I had saved?\n\nA: No, all community courses have a new URL. You\u2019ll need to sign in to get to\nthem, and you can bookmark the new URLs for easy access, or share them with\nanyone.\n\n## Memrise Approved courses\n\nThere are 3 types of Memrise-approved courses:\n\n  * Wordlists based on the old \"Memrise official\" courses. If you were learning official courses on the old Memrise product, you'll find the same content here. There are 1000s of these wordlists in each language.\n  * Lists based on the most popular community courses. We've looked at the lists that people are most interested in, checked them, improved translations where needed and added videos. There are 1000s of these wordlists.\n  * Lists based on media content, YouTube videos and other user requests. We can generate lists based on any topic. There are 10k+ of these lists in each language.\n\n## Changes to Memrise-approved courses\n\nAlongside our flashcard features, over the last 12 months, Memrise has been\nintroducing:\n\n  * Hundreds of thousands of native speaker videos whose vocab corresponds with the words and phrases you learn. This allows you to hear the words you learn spoken with accents, truncation and at full tempo. This will help you recognise the words spoken in real life by native speakers.\n  * MemBot, our AI chatbot, allows you to have conversations, spoken or written, so you can practice using the words you\u2019ve learned.\n\nTo ensure everyone has access to these new benefits, we are working on an\nupdate of the app that will happen sometime after we have finished moving the\ncommunity courses to a separate website. We\u2019ll keep posting about that update\nin this blog.\n\nHow do these changes affect you?\n\n  * If you\u2019re only learning Memrise-approved courses, you don\u2019t have to do anything right now. All of your progress will be taken across to the new version of the app.\n  * If you are learning a mix of Memrise-approved courses and community courses, you\u2019ll need to use the new website and main Memrise product separately for each. You\u2019ll be able to use the same login details for both.\n\n### Memrise-approved courses FAQ\n\nQ: Where\u2019s my progress? How does the new experience work?\n\nInstead of having a series of \u201cLevels\u201d per language (e.g. Spanish 1 through to\nSpanish 7), there is now a single course for each language. The content in\neach course is broken down into \u201cScenarios\u201d.\n\n\u201cScenarios\u201d has two parts: \u201cLearn\u201d, and \u201cReview\u201d.\n\nEverything you have previously learned will appear in the \u201cReview\u201d section,\nincluding Difficult Words and Speed Review.\n\nAdditionally, the new experience includes thousands of native speaker videos\n(\u201cVideos\u201d tab) and an AI bot to practice speaking with (\u201cConversations\u201d tab).\n\nMemrise before: (showing levels)\n\nMemrise now: (showing scenarios)\n\nQ: But what are Scenarios?\n\nA: Scenarios are just vocabulary lists grouped by topic. They're similar to\nwhat you would recognise as \u201cWord lists\u201d or \u201cLevels\u201d. Most of these lists are\neveryday \u2018scenarios\u2019 such as checking into a hotel or buying groceries. Others\nare simpler, like months, numbers, or questions.\n\nQ: Where are my word lists?\n\nA: All of the words you learned previously now live in the \u201cScenarios\u201d tab.\n\nGo to the \u201cReview\u201d section in \u201cScenarios\u201d to find all the words and phrases\nyou previously learned in \u201cLevels\u201d.\n\n\u201cScenario\u201d names are not the same as the \u201cLevel\u201d names, but your words and\nphrases are there.\n\nQ: Is my progress lost?\n\nA: No, please be assured it\u2019s not lost. All the words you have learned now\nlive in \u201cScenarios\u201d.\n\nThe words you have learned are \u2018marked as known\u2019, which means you have fully\nlearned them. They will still be resurfaced in \u201cReview\u201d.\n\nHowever, some \u201cScenarios\u201d will have more words than the original lists. These\nshow up in the \u201cLearn\u201d section. There, you can mark these as \u201cI already know\nthis\u201d and the whole Scenario will be completed.\n\nFollow us for even more language related fun\n\n800k followers\n\n## The Memrise Way\n\n### Immersion language learning: The best way to learn a new language\n\n24/09/2021 0 Min Read\n\n### What language should I learn?\n\n26/05/2021 0 Min Read\n\n### Hardest Languages to Learn: Mind-Boggling Languages made easy\n\n14/05/2021 0 Min Read\n\nLearn more about Memrise\n\nStart learning\n\n  * About Us\n  * Learn Arabic\n  * Arabic Course\n  * Arabic Phrasebook\n  * Contact Us\n  * Learn Spanish\n  * Spanish Course\n  * Spanish Phrasebook\n  * FAQ & Help\n  * Learn French\n  * French Course\n  * French Phrasebook\n  * Mobile app\n  * Learn German\n  * German Course\n  * German Phrasebook\n  * Plans\n  * Learn Italian\n  * Italian Course\n  * Italian Phrasebook\n  * Our Philosophy\n  * Learn Russian\n  * Russian Course\n  * Russian Phrasebook\n  * Team\n  * Learn Japanese\n  * Japanese (Kanji) Course\n  * Japanese (Kanji) Phrasebook\n  * Memrise Blog\n  * Learn Korean\n  * Korean Course\n  * Korean Phrasebook\n  * Press\n  * Learn Chinese\n  * Chinese Course\n  * Chinese Phrasebook\n  * Jobs\n  * Learn Portuguese\n  * Portuguese Course\n  * Portuguese Phrasebook\n  * Engineering Blog\n  * Learn Turkish\n  * Turkish Course\n  * Turkish Phrasebook\n  * Learning a language\n  * Learn Dutch\n  * Dutch Course\n  * Dutch Phrasebook\n  * Phrasebooks\n  * Learn Norwegian\n  * Norwegian Course\n  * Norwegian Phrasebook\n  * Learn Danish\n  * Danish Course\n  * Danish Phrasebook\n  * Learn Polish\n  * Polish Course\n  * Polish Phrasebook\n  * Learn Swedish\n  * Swedish Course\n  * Swedish Phrasebook\n  * Learn Yoruba\n  * Yoruba Course\n  * Yoruba Phrasebook\n  * Learn Icelandic\n  * Icelandic Course\n  * Icelandic Phrasebook\n  * Learn Mongolian\n  * Mongolian Course\n  * Mongolian Phrasebook\n  * Learn Slovenian\n  * Slovenian Course\n  * Slovenian Phrasebook\n  * Learn Greek\n  * Greek Course\n  * Greek Phrasebook\n  * Learn Indonesian\n  * Indonesian Course\n  * Indonesian Phrasebook\n  * Brazilian Portuguese Course\n  * Brazilian Portuguese Phrasebook\n  * Japanese (Romaji) Course\n  * Japanese (Romaji) Phrasebook\n  * Mexican Spanish Course\n  * Mexican Spanish Phrasebook\n\nTerms of Use Privacy Policy Cookie Policy\n\n## Welcome\n\n# This site asks for consent to use your data\n\n  * perm_identity\n\nPersonalised advertising and content, advertising and content measurement,\naudience research and services development\n\n  * devices\n\nStore and/or access information on a device\n\n  * How can I change my choice?\n\n  * What if I don't consent?\n\n  * How does legitimate interest work?\n\n  * Do I have to consent to everything?\n\nYour personal data will be processed and information from your device\n(cookies, unique identifiers, and other device data) may be stored by,\naccessed by and shared with 136 TCF vendor(s) and 63 ad partner(s), or used\nspecifically by this site or app.\n\nSome vendors may process your personal data on the basis of legitimate\ninterest, which you can object to by managing your options below.
