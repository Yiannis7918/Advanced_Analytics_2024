See media help.\n\nZotero (/zo\u028a\u02c8t\u025bro\u028a/^[7]) is free and open-source reference management software\nto manage bibliographic data and related research materials, such as PDF and\nePUB files. Features include web browser integration, online syncing,\ngeneration of in-text citations, footnotes, and bibliographies, integrated\nPDF, ePUB and HTML readers with annotation capabilities, and a note editor, as\nwell as integration with the word processors Microsoft Word, LibreOffice\nWriter, and Google Docs. It was originally created at the Center for History\nand New Media at George Mason University and, as of 2021, is developed by the\nnon-profit Corporation for Digital Scholarship.\n\n## Features[edit]\n\nWhen the Zotero Connector extension^[8] is installed in a compatible web\nbrowser, a special icon appears in the browser toolbar when a catalog entry or\na resource (book, article, thesis) is being viewed on many websites (such as\nlibrary catalogues or databases like PubMed, Google Scholar, Google Books,\nAmazon.com, Wikipedia, and publishers' websites). Clicking this icon saves\nreference information to the Zotero library. Such functionality is made\npossible by 'translators' \u2013 short pieces of computer code, or scripts^[9] to\nunderstand the structure of web pages and to parse them into citations using\nits internal formats.^[10] For mobile devices or browsers that do not support\nthe Zotero Connector extension, a bookmarklet was available, but has been\ndiscontinued.^[11]\n\nZotero can also save a copy of the webpage, or, in the case of academic\narticles, a copy of the full text PDF. Users can then add notes, tags,\nattachments, and their own metadata. Items are organized through a drag-and-\ndrop interface, and can be searched.\n\nSelections of the local reference library data can later be exported as\nformatted bibliographies. Furthermore, all entries including bibliographic\ninformation and user-created rich-text memos of the selected articles can be\nsummarized into an HTML report.^[12]\n\nZotero users can generate citations and bibliographies through word processor\nplugins, or directly in Zotero, using Citation Style Language styles. The\nhouse styles of most academic journals are available in Zotero, and the\nbibliography can be reformatted with a few clicks. Zotero also allows users to\ncreate their own customised citation styles.\n\nZotero can import and export citations from or to many formats, including\nWikipedia Citation Templates,^[13] BibTeX, BibLateX, RefWorks, MODS, COinS,\nCitation Style Language/JSON, refer/BibIX, RIS, TEI, several flavours of RDF,\nEvernote, and EndNote.\n\nZotero can associate notes with bibliographic items. It can annotate PDFs and\nsynchronise them with any of its desktop apps and its iOS and Android apps.\n\nAs of 2022, Zotero supports more than forty languages (some of them not\ncompletely translated^[14]).\n\nZotero has no institutional customer support service, but the Zotero website\nprovides extensive information, including instructional screencasts,\ntroubleshooting tips, a list of known issues, and user forums. Questions and\nissues raised in the forums are answered quickly, with users and developers\nsuggesting solutions.^[15] Many academic institutions provide Zotero tutorials\nto their members.\n\nMost citation style and translator codes are written by volunteers from the\ncommunity and, as open-source scripts, may be used by third-party tools as\nwell, for example Wikipedia's 'Citoid' citation generator.^[16]\n\n## Extensions, plugins, related applications[edit]\n\n### Extensions[edit]\n\n#### Cita[edit]\n\nWhen using the Cita plugin, first released in 2021,^[17] Zotero supports\nautomated retrieval and sharing of citation network data from and to external\nsources, and local citation network visualization.^[18] This further\nintegrates Zotero to the Initiative for Open Citations ecosystem, including\nOpenCitations and Wikidata.^[19]\n\n#### ZotFile[edit]\n\nPDFs (or other files) can be synchronized from Zotero to other mobile apps\nthrough the ZotFile plugin.^[20]^[21]\n\n### Juris-M[edit]\n\nJuris-M is a fork of Zotero with additional features supporting legal research\nand multilingual citations.^[22]^[23]^[24] It allows for multilingual\ncitations, and translations and transliterations of citation fields and\nprovides additional support for needs of scholars in fields of law. It was\ncreated by Frank Bennett, an associate professor of comparative law at Nagoya\nUniversity, who continues to maintain it.^[25] Amongst the legal citation\nstyles supported are the American Bluebook style, the UK OSCOLA style, and the\nCanadian McGill style. Many other European and Commonwealth jurisdictions are\nalso supported.^[22]\n\n### Mobile apps[edit]\n\nZotero mobile apps are available for iOS (iPad and iPhone). Several apps not\ndeveloped by Zotero for Android tablets and phones are available as well.^[21]\nThe iOS app is developed by the creators of the Zotero desktop app and was\nreleased in March 2022.^[26] A Beta version of Zotero's own Android app by\nZotero was released in December 2023.^[27]^[28]\n\n### Web library[edit]\n\nSynchronizing a library to zotero.org allows users to access and edit the\nlibrary in the \"web library\" interface from any current web browser, including\nthe mobile version of the website on a tablet or mobile phone.^[21] Users can\nsave new references to the web library using its \"magic wand\" button.^[8]\n\n### ZoteroBib[edit]\n\nIn May 2018, Zotero's creators launched the web-based bibliography tool\nZoteroBib (zbib.org), where users can generate bibliographies on the web\nwithout installing Zotero or creating a Zotero account.^[29]\n\n## Financial support and awards[edit]\n\nDevelopment of Zotero has been funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the\nAlfred P. Sloan Foundation, and the Institute of Museum and Library Services,\nas well as user donations. The storage subscriptions of individuals and\ninstitutions, which allow cloud syncing of attached files in users' libraries,\nfund Zotero's development and services.\n\nZotero has won awards from PC Magazine, Northwestern University's CiteFest\ncompetition, and the American Political Science Association.^[30]\n\n## History[edit]\n\nThe name \"Zotero\" is loosely derived from the Albanian verb zot\u00ebroj, meaning\n\"to master\".^[31]\n\nThe first release of Zotero, 1.0.0b2.r1, was made available in October 2006 as\nan add-on for the Firefox web browser. Development of Zotero 1.0.x continued\nuntil May 2009, when Zotero 1.0.10 was released.\n\nIn 2008, Thomson Reuters sued the Commonwealth of Virginia and George Mason\nUniversity, based on the claim that Zotero's developers had, in violation of\nthe EndNote EULA, reverse-engineered EndNote and provided Zotero with the\nability to convert EndNote's proprietary .ens styles into Citation Style\nLanguage (CSL) styles.^[32] George Mason University responded that they would\nnot renew their site license for EndNote and that \"anything created by users\nof Zotero belongs to those users, and that it should be as easy as possible\nfor Zotero users to move to and from the software as they wish, without\nfriction\".^[33] The journal Nature editorialized that \"the virtues of\ninteroperability and easy data sharing among researchers are worth restating.\nImagine if Microsoft Word or Excel files could be opened and saved only in\nthese proprietary formats, for example. It would be impossible for OpenOffice\nand other such software to read and save these files using open standards\u2014as\nthey can legally do.\"^[34]\n\nThe case was dismissed on June 4, 2009, due to a lack of jurisdiction.^[35]\nAlthough the Virginia Supreme Court granted an appeal to Thomson Reuters in\nthis case on December 18, 2009, the appeal was withdrawn on January 11, 2011.\n^[citation needed]\n\nZotero 2.0, released in February 2010, added online features such as metadata\nand file syncing and group libraries, and included a license change from the\nEducational Community License to GPLv3.^[36] Development of Zotero 2.0.x\ncontinued until October 2010, when Zotero 2.0.9 was released.\n\nZotero 2.1, released in March 2011, adds CSL 1.0 support, Firefox 4\ncompatibility (the minimum is Firefox 3.6), and Zotero Commons, through which\nmaterials can be uploaded to the Internet Archive.\n\nZotero Standalone, first released in January 2011, allowed Zotero to be run as\nan independent program outside Firefox.^[37] Using XULRunner, Zotero\nStandalone was made available for Windows, Linux, and macOS.^[37] Browser\nconnectors were available to use Zotero Standalone with the web browsers\nSafari and Chrome.^[37]\n\nZotero 3.0, released in January 2012, includes the stable release of Zotero\nStandalone as well as several new major features, including overhauled Word\nand LibreOffice^[38] integration and duplicate detection. Version 3.0 also\nintroduced the Zotero bookmarklet for iOS^[39] browsers, Android browser,\nChrome for Android, Firefox mobile, and Opera mobile allowing uses to save\nreference data to their Zotero library when using mobile devices.^[40]\n\nZotero 4.0, released in April 2013, includes new features such as automatic\njournal abbreviations, direct downloading of PDFs to Zotero Standalone from\nthe Zotero Firefox plugin, a single save button on the Zotero browser plugin\n(which combines the functionality of the address bar icon and the \"Create Web\nPage Item from Current Page\" button), colored tags, and on-demand file\nsyncing.^[41]\n\nZotero 5.0, released in July 2017, did away with the Firefox plugin, replacing\nit with a Firefox connector for the new standalone product, which was now\nsimply branded as the Zotero app.^[42] This move was the result of Mozilla\ndiscontinuing its powerful extension framework on which Zotero for Firefox was\nbased.^[43] The Zotero Connectors for Chrome and Safari were also revamped,\nand given additional features.^[44] A point update also introduced a new PDF\nrecognizer, using a Zotero-designed web service that doesn't rely on Google\nScholar, to retrieve metadata for PDF files.^[45]\n\nIn October 2018, automatic PDF file retrieval, until then limited to directly\nsaving from original web sources, was expanded to include open-access PDF\nfiles available at Unpaywall,^[46] and integration with word processors was\nextended to include Google Docs through the Firefox and Chrome\nconnectors.^[47] In June 2019, as the result of a collaboration with\nRetraction Watch, Zotero started flagging retracted publications in its app,\nand warns users who try to cite retracted articles.^[48]\n\nIn March 2022, with the release of version 6.0, Zotero added an integrated PDF\nviewer and annotation functionality, in addition to a new note editor.^[49] An\niOS app was also released.\n\nIn May 2023, the Zotero 7 beta was officially announced.^[50] Zotero 7\nrepresents a major upgrade of the underlying Mozilla Firefox architecture,\naccompanied by a major rewrite of its source code.^[51] The upgrade of Zotero\nalso improved performance and compatibility with different operating systems,\nincluding native support for Apple Silicon Macs. A 64-bit Windows build also\nallows for a better handling of large libraries and PDF files.\n\nIn August 2023, EPUB and HTML readers with annotation tools were added to the\ndesktop app in the Zotero 7 beta.^[52]\n\nIn December 2023, a beta version of the Android app was released.^[28]\n\nIn January 2024, a major redesign of the graphical user interface of Zotero\nwas announced and directly made accessible to developers and beta testers\nalong with the last version of Zotero 7 beta.^[53] The new design exhibits a\nmore ergonomic and modern look while still remaining familiar to the long-time\nZotero users. It was also accompanied by a refreshed version of the Zotero\nlogo.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Free and open-source software portal\n\n  * Comparison of reference management software\n  * Citation Style Language (CSL)\n  * CiteProc\n  * JabRef\n  * LibX\n  * ScrapBook \u2013 A Firefox extension having similar capture features, but no bibliographic functions\n  * unAPI\n  * Mendeley \u2013 proprietary equivalent software tool\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"1.0 changelog [Zotero Documentation]\". zotero.org. 12 February 2015.\n  2. ^ \"Release 6.0.37\". 19 March 2024.
