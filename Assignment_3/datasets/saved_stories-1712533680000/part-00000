The company uses geofencing and\nproprietary algorithms to produce a \u201cTalitrix score\u201d that agencies can use to\ndetermine whether someone\u2019s behavior on pretrial release or probation should\nsubject them to re-arrest and incarceration.\n\nTalitrix provided a demonstration of the company\u2019s product for APF and Atlanta\nPolice Department (APD) officials in January 2023. During that demonstration,\nTalitrix CEO Justin Hawkins expressed an interest in integrating his company\u2019s\ntechnology with Fusus, the surveillance company that underpins Atlanta\u2019s\nmassive camera network.\n\nThe day after the demonstration, APF\u2019s vice president of programs, Gregory\nMcNiff, emailed Anthony Baldoni, senior vice president of strategic\ninitiatives at Fusus, to make introductions and express an interest in the\nintegration on behalf of the city. \u201cThe Mayor\u2019s office is ready to fund the\npurchase of Talitrix monitoring bracelets for the purpose of tracking repeat\noffenders,\u201d McNiff wrote.\n\nThe Fusus-Talitrix integration would combine GPS-enabled digital shackles\nfeaturing biometric monitoring capabilities with the growing canopy of Fusus-\nlinked video cameras in Atlanta. By integrating Talitrix equipment with AI-\npowered real-time video surveillance that can trigger multiple public and\nprivately owned \u201cpan-tilt-zoom\u201d (PTZ) cameras at a person\u2019s precise location,\nAPF planned to put up to 900 people under constant video, audio, biometric,\nand GPS surveillance as a condition of pre-trial release.\n\n\u201cThis [proposal] turns the City of Atlanta into an open-air prison for\neveryone on electronic monitoring,\u201d said Cooper Quinton, security researcher\nand senior staff technologist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation\u2019s Threat\nLab.\n\nSeveral technology and legal experts who reviewed the integration proposal\nconcluded it would be the most sweeping state-run electronic surveillance\nprogram in the United States and raised serious legal and ethical concerns.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeking huge upticks in the rate of electronic monitoring. It\u2019s gone up\ntenfold since 2005, and it doubled between 2021 and 2022. It\u2019s already very\ninvasive,\u201d Quinton said, referring to a report released by the criminal\njustice research and policy nonprofit Vera Institute. \u201cThis is an\nunprecedented expansion of that surveillance. Even if you have not yet been\nconvicted of a crime under this system, you and your family and your friends\ncould be subject to constant, targeted video surveillance.\u201d\n\nFallon McClure, deputy director of policy and advocacy with the ACLU of\nGeorgia, noted that Georgia\u2019s courts have disapproved of blanket electronic\nmonitoring. \u201cWe are gravely concerned about what will be a panopticon for\nthose on pre-trial release,\u201d she said.\n\nKendra Albert, a public interest technology researcher at Harvard University\u2019s\nBerkman Klein Center for Internet and Society, had a more emphatic\nperspective.\n\n\u201cGrave concerns would be putting it mildly. My level of concern would be best\nexpressed in expletives,\u201d said Albert.\n\nAlbert said that no other electronic surveillance program to their knowledge\nhas subjected people to the level of constant monitoring APF\u2019s proposed Fusus-\nTalitrix merge would entail. The proposal could subject people on pre-trial\nrelease and everyone around them to warrantless wiretapping without notice or\nconsent, they said, a prospect that \u201cfunctionally upends the relationship\nunder the Constitution that the police are supposed to have when they want to\nsurveil people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is fucked,\u201d Albert added.\n\n## Black Communities as \u201cunwitting research subjects\u201d\n\nRecords show the APF planned to test the Talitrix technology on a cohort of\nso-called \u201crepeat offenders.\u201d The group consists of 1,000 people convicted of\nthree or more felonies who are arrested again in Fulton County. Over 93\npercent of APF-designated \u201crepeat offenders\u201d are Black, according to a 2022\nannual report.\n\nDrug offenses are the most common charge, representing 34 to 40 percent of the\narrests in the dataset, according to APF\u2019s 2022 report.\n\nMayor Dickens and APD officials have worked with APF\u2019s Repeat Offender\nCommission on a multi-year public relations campaign to paint repeat offenders\nas a scourge whose \u201clife of crime\u201d makes up \u201c40 percent\u201d of the offenses in\nAtlanta. However, APF\u2019s data characterized 83 percent of repeat offender cases\nas non-violent.\n\nNotes from an APF Repeat Offender Commission meeting reflect racial concerns\namongst stakeholders. President and CEO of the Buckhead Coalition, Jim\nDurrett, is quoted in the notes questioning the presentation of the\ncommission\u2019s marketing materials. \u201cHow important is it to put their picture up\non the flyer? Five black males. What is being received? What message are we\nsending?\u201d Durrett asked.\n\nThose notes reflect an unnamed party responding, \u201cMost of the jail is\nprimarily African-American so the stats support it.\u201d\n\nTesting of \u201cunvetted Talitrix technology appears to align with this country\u2019s\nhistory of using Black people and communities as unwitting research subjects,\u201d\nsaid Tiffany Roberts, public policy director at the Southern Center for Human\nRights.\n\nLaura Rivera, an attorney with Just Futures Law, agreed, saying, \u201cMake no\nmistake: these draconian measures are meant not to ensure safety, but to\ncontrol the bodies of Black and Brown people, including immigrants.\u201d\n\nConcerns surrounding the use of Talitrix devices spurred APF to form a\ntemporary task force in June 2023 aimed at responding to objections and\nallowing the project to proceed.\n\nThe APF pushed forward with the plan and paid student volunteers at Georgia\nState University and Georgia Tech a $50 stipend to install and wear Talitrix\ndevices in October and November 2023 as a \u201cproof of concept\u201d plan for the\nintegration. A month before the pilot program, Talitrix donated at least\n$25,000 to the APF as a sponsor of the foundation\u2019s \u201cCrime is Toast\u201d\nbreakfast.\n\n## Repeat Offenders?\n\nBoth the price tag and the process of the Fusus-Talitrix proposal appear to\nfall outside Atlanta\u2019s procurement rules. Those rules require any solicitation\nfor a city contract over $1 million that would be presented to the city\ncouncil for approval to run through the city\u2019s procurement department and\nundergo a review by the city\u2019s Inspector General\u2019s (IG) Independent\nProcurement Review Division.\n\nThe APF planned to fund a 6-month Talitrix pilot for $234,000 and then have\nthe city assume the contract while adding 700 devices for a total cost\nexceeding $1 million. APF funding would have allowed the initial phase of the\nplan to avoid any pre-award independent procurement review.\n\nThe IG found in March 2023 that the $109 million single-source contract the\nAtlanta Police Department inked with Axon failed to follow procurement\nguidelines. APD agreed to revise its procedures and retrain its staff.\n\nAs of March 22, the City of Atlanta\u2019s Procurement Office confirmed Talitrix is\nnot listed as a vendor. Despite an email from the APF stating otherwise, APD\u2019s\npublic affairs office told the Atlanta Community Press Collective \u201cthe Mayor\u2019s\nOffice did not approve funding for Talitrix\u201d and \u201cthere was never a commitment\nto purchase\u201d the Talitrix technology.\n\nThe Atlanta Community Press Collective also inquired about the status of the\nplan to twelve members of the Repeat Offender Commission. Fulton County\nSuperior Court Judge Robert C. McBurney said the program is not active \u201cat\nleast not as a Court-authorized initiative.\u201d\n\n## \u201cDoes it pass the smell test?\u201d\n\nTalitrix is no stranger to controversy. In October 2023, the Fulton County\nCommission voted to terminate a $2.1 million contract Talitrix inked with\nSheriff Pat Labat for 1,000 devices. By October, the sheriff had deployed only\n15 devices inside Fulton\u2019s Rice Street jail. The decision to pull out of the\ndeal followed revelations that Talitrix donated tens of thousands of dollars\nto the Sheriff\u2019s campaign committee.\n\n\u201cSome $70,000 from a group of people all associated with this same enterprise\nand I think quite frankly, it raises questions, it could be perfectly legal,\nbut does it pass the smell test?\u201d Fulton County Commission Chair Rob Pitts\nsaid at the time. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (AJC) published an\ninvestigation in March alleging heavy-handed legal tactics Talitrix used\nagainst critics, including legal notices Talitrix\u2019s lawyer served on Forsyth\nCounty Commissioners who raised questions about the company. Forsyth\nCommissioner Todd Levent told the AJC that attorney Robert Ashe\u2014who is also\nrepresenting the city of Atlanta in its fight against the Cop City\nreferendum\u2014represented Talitrix in public records requests to the Forsyth\nCounty Commission following critical statements about the company by some of\nthe commissioners.\n\nThe Atlanta Police Foundation did not respond to ACPC inquiries in the weeks\nbefore publication.\n\nLocal, independent journalism takes time and resources.
