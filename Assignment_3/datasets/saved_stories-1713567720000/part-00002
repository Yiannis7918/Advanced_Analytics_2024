At least one question about the fake Leonardo bicycle\nremains, namely \u201cwho done it?\u201d Although Marinoni has been overly gullible,\nrejecting all reasonable arguments about the drawing being a fake, it should\nby no means be suggested it is he who drew the lines that made the circular\noutlines showing through from an unrelated drawing on the front into a bicycle\non the back. Nor has anyone so far pointed a finger at the monks of\nGrottaferrata. Unfortunately, some writers (including Jonathan Knight of the\nNew Scienctist and Frederico di Trocchio in L'Espresso) have interpreted the\ninformation that way, and thus indirectly implicated Prof. Lessing, the author\nof our article, as being the source of such speculation. The reader is invited\nto judge for him- or herself whether Prof. Lessing is making such claims in\nthe following texts.| Until some time ago, if you Click here you would get a\nlink to the related web site for the original article by Prof. Federico di\nTrocchio in the Italian weekly L\u2019Espresso. Update: Unfortunately, this link is\nno longer active  \n---|---  \nThe Evidence against \u201cLeonardo\u2019s Bicycle\u201dText of a paper presented at the 8th\nInternational Conference on Cycling History, Glasgow School of Art, August\n1997 Prof. Dr. Hans-Erhard LessingNews of a bicycle-like sketch said to have\nbeen discovered during the ten-year restoring period of Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s\nCodex Atlanticus popped up in 1974, when literary historian Augusto Marinoni\ngave a lecture in Vinci, Leonardo\u2019s birthplace. From the chronology of\ndisclosures and (in part circumstantial) evidence, it is now becoming clear\nthat we are dealing with a recent forgery.  \n---  \n  \nSeveral nations have been involved in the bicycle\u2019s (and the motorcycle\u2019s)\ndevelopment, and some decisive concepts can be attributed to individuals\nwithin those countries. Thus, for example, the basic two-wheeler concept on\nwhich all bicycles are based is attributed to Karl von Drais, a civil servant\nwith a background in technology acquired at the University of Heidelberg in\nGermany.[1 (Footnotes can be accessed by clicking the appropriate line \"Click\nhere for footnotes/bibliography\" above or the individual footnote number in\nthe text)] Drais\u2019 invention is well-documented with patent specifications and\nother materials which suggest that it was unprecedented.\n\nNevertheless, the competition between the industrial nations leading to World\nWar I created jingoistic priority myths, usually launched to attribute\npriority to the forger\u2019s nation. Even before this conference was initiated in\n1990 by Nicholas Clayton to replace such myths by serious historiography, our\nFrench delegate Jacques Seray had been able in 1976 to destroy the non-\nsteerable two-wheeler myth created in France in the 1890s and generally\naccepted thereafter.[2] But until 1976 it was believed worldwide that the\nfirst incarnation of the two-wheeler principle was not steerable (a myth that\nis still repeated by some today), and therefore competing priority myths\ndepict unsteerable two-wheelers, too.[3] Seen in the light of Seray\u2019s\nresearch, \u201cLeonardo\u2019s bicycle\u201d publicized worldwide in 1974[4]\u2014and again non-\nsteerable\u2014left bicycle historians like Derek Roberts skeptical, since a \u201claw\nof series\u201d appeared to apply.[5]\n\nEvidence: The \u201cLeonardo bicycle\u201d sketch shows a non-steerable two-wheeler in\nan attempt to outdo the false French priority which was still believed to be\ncorrect before 1976. This is also confirmed by a comparison of the pictorial\nbicycle evolution taken from the standard Italian book on history of\ntechnology[6] and from Marinoni, Ref. 19 (see Fig. 2).\n\nThe Sisyphean task of tracing the debate on the restoration of Leonardo\u2019s\nCodex Atlanticus in Italy thirty years ago is eased by the fact that Augusto\nMarinoni, an Italian lexicographer and philologian, then at the Catholic\nUniversity of Milan, appears to be the only maintainer of the genuineness of\nthe bicycle sketch among Leonardo scholars. Catalogues of exhibitions and\nbooks where Marinoni was not involved demonstrate a conspicuous absense of the\nbicycle sketch (e.g., Ref. 12). In what follows, I will concentrate on the\nbicycle sketch alone.\n\nThe restoration of the Codex Atlanticus was the result of an initiative of\nengineer Nando di Toni,[7] who ran a Centro Ricerche Leonardiane in Brescia\nwith a newsletter Notiziario Vinciano, and French Leonardo scholar Andr\u00e9\nCorbeau, who managed to exhibit original sheets from the Codex in Paris as\nearly as 1961. This may account for the different durations given for the\nrestoration period: While Marinoni talks of ten years, between 1960 and 1970\n(presumably to include dismantling of the album for the Paris exhibition), the\ndirector of the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan specified the restoration\nperiod as 1966 until 1969.[8] Pope Paul VI, born a Brescian and at that time\narchbishop of Milan, gave his consent to the restoration under the condition\nthat it was to be performed by monks in the cloister Grottaferrata near Rome\nfor the reason that the Codex Atlanticus and the Ambrosian Library belong to\nthe Vatican.\n\nAn American in Madrid Nine monks had already been working on the restoration\nof the Codex Atlanticus for one year at Grottaferrata when sensational news\nelectrified the press worldwide in 1967: Jules Piccus, a Bostonian Romanist,\nhad accidentally discovered two albums of Leonardo notes and drawings in the\nNational Library of Madrid when ordering something else. These were called\nCodices Madrid henceforth. The news[9] was accompanied by a sample page\n(Fig.3), definitely showing chainwheels with chains for lifting buckets with\ncounterweights for wells or the like, the idea being apparently to replace a\nrope and pulley in order to prevent the rope from jumping off the pulley or to\navoid early attrition. Leonardo\u2019s handwriting there says, \u201cHow to make the\nrope of a counterweight, which never winds upon itself, pull with strength...\u201d\nReti was enthusiastic:[10]\n\n\u201c... Leonardo\u2019s beautiful sketches of a hinged-link chain for a wheel-lock of\na gun[11] were well known, but that chain had only a few links and, of course,\nwas not endless. Now we have a whole collection of true chain-drives and\nsprocket wheels. In case we should be in any further doubt, attention is\ncalled to the little drawing at the bottom, where a complete assembly is\nmasterfully sketched.\u201d\n\nThirty years later this has given way to a more sober interpretation:[12]\n\n\u201c...Leonardo designed several types of chains. He especially recommended their\nuse in preference to ropes for lifting heavy loads. He did not, however, seem\ninterested in exploring the use of chains to transmit motion.\u201d\n\nBut at their press conference in Boston on February 1967, apparently Piccus or\nReti had popularized the transmission chain as \u201cbicycle-like.\u201d\n\nEvidence: The worldwide communication of the popularisation \u201cbicycle-like\u201d for\nthe transmission chains from Codices Madrid suggested the forgery of a\n\u201cLeonardo chain bicycle\u201d to the forger(s), allowing the forgery to be dated to\nthe post-1967 period. An identical chain drive appears in the bicycle sketch\nput into the Codex Atlanticus.\n\nIt seems that the library\u2019s director in Madrid became disenchanted with this\npress interpretation and cancelled his contract with Piccus and Reti,\ncontacting scholars in Milan and London for the facsimile edition of the\nCodices Madrid.[13]\n\nA Bicycle Like New Let us turn to the debate after Marinoni had released the\nbicycle sketch in a lecture[14] at Leonardo\u2019s birthplace Vinci on April 15,\n1974 covering the Codices Madrid\u2014although the bicycle sketch was found in the\nCodex Atlanticus. At the time of this lecture, the printing of the bicycle\nsketch was irrevocably underway in the Italian original of The Unknown\nLeonardo (Ref. 4) and in volume Two of the new Giunti facsimile,[15] which may\nhave been one reason for the delayed disclosure. Or is there another reason to\nwithhold disclosure of a seemingly sensational discovery for four years or\nmore?\n\nMarinoni never gave the details, nor the date of his discovery. In his\npresentation, he tried to disprove the objection from an undisclosed source\nthat a youngster may have manipulated the sketch into the Codex around the\nturn of the century\u2014 presumably a rhetorical position he thought up himself.\nIt is, of course, not good academic style to conceal names or quotes of\nopponents\u2014and Marinoni holds back the fact that the Codex Atlanticus had\nundergone a ten-year reproduction for the old Hoepli facsimile[16] at the turn\nof the century, providing access to it for many. Also it is the experience of\nthis conference that jingoism befalls those with greying temples rather than\nyoung people.\n\nThe bicycle sketch became known worldwide through the popular three-volume set\nThe Unknown Leonardo in 1974. Not many then realised that the bicycle find was\nnot in volume 3, Leonardo The Inventor, where it would have belonged, but\nbanished into an appendix to the second volume, Leonardo The Scientist, among\nwhose authors was Augusto Marinoni\u2014an indication of a dissension between\nsceptic editor Reti and maintainer Marinoni. Clearly the sketch is not from\nLeonardo\u2019s hand, and without proven contemporaneity of the scribbles,\nMarinoni\u2019s tale of a pupil copying the bicycle from a lost drawing of his\nmaster remains mere speculation.\n\nAfter Marinoni had placed the news[17] in the Italian weekly magazine\nL\u2019Espresso under the title \u201cA Bicycle like new,\u201d several authors came to the\nrescue of Italian scholarship. Nando de Toni, former member of the Commissione\nVinciana, wrote the following letter to the editor:[18]\n\n\u201cAs to the bicycle, I want to indicate that on various occasions some sheets\nfrom the Codex Atlanticus have left more or less officially the Ambrosiana\nbefore the restoration requested by friend Andr\u00e9 Corbeau and the writer.\nWhoever had the opportunity to take away, bring to Florence, or send back from\nLugano by mail, sheets of Leonardo, robbed from the Ambrosiana, was very well\nable at different times to poke fun at the descendants by drawing that\nrudimentary bicycle. To pretend to be a result of the times of Leonardo it\ncertainly did not need to have the fenders, the chain cover, the brakes, the\nheadlight, the bell and the rear reflector. It was sufficient to leave the\nidea of pedals, of multiplication, of chain transmission, of the seat, and of\nthe handlebars, even when it is obviously not working in the end.\u201d\n\nOne has to add that Marinoni always works with the model of a naive forger who\nlonged to put in a modern steel bike, only prevented from doing that by his\nown ineptitude. Marinoni\u2019s reaction can be read in his brochure on Leonardo\u2019s\nautomobile and bicycle[19]\u2014 he disproves statements that de Toni never made:\n\n\u201cSticking to the idea of a forgery, the engineer Nando de Toni proposed in a\nletter to L\u2019Espresso, that had published a short note by the author in April\n1974, the following solution to the \u201cwho-dunit.\u201d As is known, during a series\nof thefts in the Ambrosiana in the year 1966, also a sheet of the Codex\nAtlanticus was lost. According to de Toni, this should have concerned sheet\nNo. 133. To raise the value of his prey, the thief should have sketched a\nbicycle on it, believing that one would regard any scribble, however\nsenseless, as the work of the universal genius and forsighted Leonardo da\nVinci. What a foolish thief had indeed expected to be able to imitate Leonardo\nthis simply? In reality, the drawings concerned were on sheets 342\u201343\naccording to the old count, and have been published in the weekly magazine\nEpoca of November 24, 1963. Other sheets never left the Ambrosiana, and sheet\n133 was at the time of the theft already in Grottaferrata for restoration,\nsince the Codex was brought there in parts.\u201d\n\nThe strategy is to give the reader the impression that the opponent has been\ndisproved completely without letting him know the opponent\u2019s argument.\n\nAnother member of the Commissione Vinciana, Anna Maria Brizio, art historian\nat the university of Milan and coauthor of The Unknown Leoardo, was\ninterviewed[20] by the monthly magazine Panorama:\n\n\u201cThe point is to ascertain if the sketch of the bicycle was already on the\nback side of sheet 133, when Pompeo Leoni assembled the manuscript at the end\nof 1500s, or if somebody put it in during a following epoch. How can one be\nsure that in 300 years of migration the sheet had not fallen in the hands of\nan extemporaneous draftsman? To solve the question, it remains only to consult\nthe experts: only a chemical test could tell if Leonardo\u2019s bicycle is another\nmarvelous anticipation or a vulgar scrawl.\u201d\n\nMarinoni replies like this:\n\n\u201c...Professor Anna Maria Brizio, who uttered skepticism for the case, based\nher opinion on the following arguments: Firstly, we are not certain that the\nsheet has not fallen into the hands of a hobby drawer during its 300-year\nmigration. Secondly, the bicycle was drawn with a different ink than Leonardo\nused for the fortification on the front side of sheet 133. The first argument\nwas already partly invalidated by the journalist who didn\u2019t consider the error\nof the 300-year migration in detail (it presumably never happened in reality)\nbut who remarked correctly that the first modern bicycle goes back to the year\n1885 and that therefore the \u201cforgery\u201d\u2014if one has to do with that\u2014could not\nhave originated before the end of the last century. But the journalist did not\nknow that the sheet was in the codex in 1965 and that the forger could have\nbeen only one of the restorers or the first scholars concerned with the\nproject (possibly even the undersigned). The second argument, however, is an\nimprovised wrong assumption, since we have not an ink drawing\u2014as already\nsaid\u2014but a pencil drawing.\u201d\n\nApparently a chemical analysis or an age test was never performed on the\nbicycle sketch. And like in the famous case of the Piltdown Man, we always\nhave the option that Marinoni was the uninitiated discoverer of what was done\nby a different forger or forgers. However, an important piece of evidence in\ndating the bicycle sketch is that it is not from Leonardo\u2019s hand and produced\nno visible set-off overleaf in contrast to the obscene scribbles surrounding\nit\u2014an indication that it has been put in after the unfolding of the sheet.\n\nAn International Opponent A serious blow to \u201cLeonardo\u2019s bicycle\u201d appeared in\nCarlo Pedretti\u2019s catalog of the restored sheets of the Codex Atlanticus.[21]\nThe art historian at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)\ndescribes the restoration as chaotic\u2014he always talks of the monks as\n\u201crestorers\u201d in quote\u2014 and gives examples of how they made things worse. He\ndeplores the lack of any scientific report by the \u201crestorers\u201d\u2014reportedly some\nsketches have disappeared through the use of unknown chemicals. About the\nobscene back side of sheet 132 he writes:\n\n\u201cScribbles, not by Leonardo, probably not from Leonardo\u2019s time. Self\nexplanatory.\u201d\n\nAnd on the back side of sheet 133:\n\n\u201cScribbles, including the word \u201csalaj,\u201d not by Leonardo, probably not from\nLeonardo\u2019s time. Self-explanatory. See f. 132 verso, to which this sheet was\noriginally joined. When I examined the original sheets in 1961, holding them\nagainst a strong light so as to detect elements of their (at the time) hidden\nversos, I noticed the presence of scribbles in black chalk as well as light\ntraces of circles in pen and ink, which appeared to be the beginning of some\ngeometrical diagrams. These have turned out to be part of a rough sketch of a\nvehicle that resembles a bicycle. Similar rough sketches, not by Leonardo, are\nfound on other sheets of Leonardo\u2019s manuscripts and drawings.\u201d\n\nAnd he encloses a sketch from memory[22] of what he saw in translucence back\nin 1961 (Fig. 3 top); in a postscript he attributes no significance to the\nbicycle scribble:\n\n\u201cThe scurrilous scribble of a pupil on the verso of a two-part sheet of\nfortification studies, ff. 132 and 133, hardly deserve the attention they have\nreceived in recent publications, and even less so does the sketch of a\nbicycle.\u201d\n\nHe quotes Marinoni by Ref. 4 and Ref.\n\n14.Marinoni replies to Pedretti in his brochure, again disproving statements\nthat were not made:\u201cApparently Pedretti is convinced that we have to accept\nhis unfounded judgement simply quia ipse dixit. Still he acknowledges that the\ndrawings are authored by a young man, a pupil, but whose pupil?? Certainly not\nLeonardo\u2019s, if we assume following Pedretti that Leonardo had been dead a\nfairly long time. How could a young man\u2014some tens of years later\u2014have\nremembered another young man having lived much earlier and infuriated without\nreason against the shadow of a past meanwhile long gone? Which celestial\nintuition would have caused him to draw exactly this bicycle with the\nmeticulous detail of chain and chainwheel that was already drawn by Leonardo\nat a time unknown to him? There is no logical answer to these questions, but\nthe fact that a young man drew a bicycle in the middle of the 16th century\nappears to be quite unimportant to Pedretti. He pleads to pass this problem\nover, as if it would suffice to close one\u2019s eyes to let the bicycle disappear.\nI don\u2019t believe that other scholars are ready to follow this willful\nproposal.\u201d\n\nWhereas Marinoni\u2019s recent Internet Web page of the city of Legnano[23]\ncontends, \u201cThis is a decisive argument on which I could not rely in 1972.\u201d\n\nEvidence In 1961 the translucent back side showed geometrical circles and\nlines. The bicycle sketch definitely was not there, since its thick brown\ncrayon would have been detected easily in translucence.[24]\n\nThe forger(s) made economic use of the lines already present (to minimize\ncrude erasures like the ones between the wheels) which explains the\nidiosyncrasies of the handlebar design. Accordingly, the bicycle sketch is\ndefinitely a recent forgery that can be dated between 1967 and 1974.\n\nTo protect the inference that the appearance of the chainwheel from Codices\nMadrid within the sketch of the Codex Atlanticus warrants the mental\nauthorship by Leonardo himself, Marinoni leaves the path of truth in his\nbrochure, stating in the caption to the page from Codices Madrid (see Fig. 3\ncenter) and again on his Web page (Ref. 23):\n\nThe importance of this coincidence should not be underestimated, since this is\na detail that no modern forger could know before publication of the said Codex\nin the year 1974.\n\nThis refers to the facsimile edition of Codices Madrid, Ref. 13. But\u2014see\nabove\u2014there were numerous newspapers and news magazines worldwide reporting\nthis very sample page in 1967, including an Italian publication by Nando di\nToni in 1967.[25] It can be predicted that Marinoni or his Internet-publishing\nentourage will use his piecemeal release of discovery detail to claim now that\nhe discovered the sketch before 1967; but having lied once, he will no longer\nbe believed by academia.\n\nJingoism Forever\n\nIn 1983, three American authors realised that a nonsteerable two-wheeler was\nno longer credible and assembled a steerable one from Leonardo\u2019s machine\nelements. Their paper was apparently rejected by American referees of history\nof technology (assembling a dishwasher from Leonardo\u2019s elements does not prove\nhe thought of one), but not by the German journal Technikgeschichte.[26] Their\narticle disclosed the following:\n\n\u201cDr. Silvio A. Bedini of the Smithsonian Institution informed us amiably that\nDr. Reti has still been convinced until his death that the drawing is not\ngenuine and therefore he would not include it in his volume [The Unknown\nLeonardo, Ref. 4]. Professor Marinoni took over the editorship after Reti and\ndecided to include the sketch.\u201d\n\nThus we now have another reason for the delayed disclosure\u2014Reti\u2019s opposition\nuntil his death in 1974. When Marinoni was invited to give a presentation at\nthe 2nd Cycling History Conference in St. Etienne in 1991,[27] he was\nconfronted by the author of this paper with this statement of the leading\nLeonardo expert with a technological background. In return, Marinoni presented\nas a humorous anecdote that Reti indicted him to be the forger, which was\nunfortunately not recorded in the Proceedings, but can now be found on the Web\npage Ref. 23:\n\n\u201cThe first opponent was Ladislao Reti, whom I told the discovery during my\nfirst examination of the restored codex, while I wrote a report for the\nCommissione Vinciana in Rome. Reti denied resolutely any possibility that\nLeonardo could imagine such a vehicle in the 15th century. But when I\naccompanied him into the Biblioteca Ambrosiana and he was before the picture\nhe had to admit: \u2018This is really a bicycle\u2014therefore it is a forgery.\u2019 \u2018Who\nhas done it? And when?\u2019 I asked him. The answer was more extraordinary still\nthan the discovery: \u2018This was done by you!\u2019 [L\u2019hai fatto tu!]\u201d\n\nAgain, Marinoni fails to date this incident.\n\nSo what was the motive of the forger(s) or the uninitiated discoverer and\nmaintainer with a bad scholarly conscience? Perhaps the following passage,\nwritten in 1949 by the Italian literate Curzio Malaparte gives us the answer:\n\n\u201cIn Italy, the bicycle belongs to the national art heritage in the same way as\nMona Lisa by Leonardo, the dome of St. Peter or the Divine Comedy. It is\nsurprising that it has not been invented by Botticelli, Michelangelo, or\nRaffael. Should it happen to you, that you voice in Italy that the bicycle was\nnot invented by an Italian you will see: All miens turn sullen, a veil of\ngrief lies down onto the faces. Oh, when you say in Italy, when you say loudly\nand distinctly in a caf\u00e9 or on the street that the bicycle\u2014like the horse, the\ndog, the eagle, the flowers, the trees, the clouds\u2014has not been invented by an\nItalian (for it were the Italians that invented the horse, the dog, the eagle,\nthe flowers, the trees, the clouds) then a long shudder will run down the\npeninsula\u2019s spine, from the Alps to the Eatna.\u201d[28]\n\nFig. 1 (L), 3 (R)  \n---  \nFig. 2 of original article  \n---  \nFig. 4 of original article, also Fig \"Update-1\"  \nfig. \"  \nFootnotes / Bibliography 1.

Subsequent research by the French journalist Serge Lathi\u00e8re\nfor an article [2] brought news of an age test on the bicycle scribble, best\ndescribed by himself in a fax to Monsignore Prof Gianfranco Rabasi, the\ndirector of the Biblioteca Ambrosiana, where the Codex Atlanticus is kept:\n\u201c...I have just finished to write a paper about the \u2018Leonardo da Vinci\nbicycle.\u2019 But I've learned this morning that the page where the bicycle was\ndrawn was recently dated. So I'm sending you this fax to get more information.\nWhich team made the datation? What was dated (the ink used to draw the\nbicycle?) What kind of technique was used? What were the results? From Carlo\nPedretti and Paolo Galluzzi I've learned they found two kinds of ink:one made\nafter 1880 and another made after 1920. In this case the bicycle would be a\nfake. Could you confirm this information as soon as possible, because my\narticle has to be sent for printing very soon now...\u201d In fact, Pedretti\nconfirmed in a phone call the same day that he was told all this by Prof.\nPaolo Galluzzi, director of the Science Museum in Florence, who reportedly had\nread the news in the airplane but not noted the source. The test was \u201cnuclear\nsomething,\u201d as Pedretti put it. To the dismay of Lathi\u00e8re, Ravasi refused to\ncomment, although his library keeps the Codex Atlanticus[4]: \u201cThe library does\nnot conduct research nor give information of the kind that you request. The\nlibrary is open Monday through Friday from 9 till 17:30 o'clock. Cordiali\nsaluti.\u201d A recent letter by Galluzzi to the author confirms in essence what\nwas said above (see Fig \u201cUpdate-1\u201d). Hence not even the two circles are from\nLeonardo's hand. As late as the January 1998 issue of Scientific American,\nMarinoni's US partisan, Vernard Foley of Purdue University, returned with a\nvastly improved Leonardo bicycle replica, this time with a brand new brake\noperated by a pulling rope (see Fig. \u201cUpate-2\u201d). It came as an illustration\nwithin an article on Leonardo and the invention of the wheellock.[5].\nRectifying letters to the editor of Scientific American by David Gordon Wilson\nfrom MIT and me were not printed in subsequent issues. Remember, Foley had\nbuilt the steerable Leonardo bicycle from Leonardo's machine elements in\n1983[6]. Instead of a response to the recent letter to the Editor of the\nBoneshaker, I shall reprint Marinoni's view of the 2nd International Cycling\nHistory Conference in St. Etienne, 1991, where he was invited to speak. The\ntext stems from Marinoni's website[7] and for the sake of brevity, only the\nrelevant section is presented here in an English translation: \u201castonished the\nexperts and there were spontaneous but unspecific challenges to its\nauthenticity. However the vigorous skepticism of critics has failed to\nundermine any of (the) evidence for authenticity set up by Professor Augosto\nMarinoni, the leading Vinci scholar (pag. 12)\u201dFootnotes to update 1.
