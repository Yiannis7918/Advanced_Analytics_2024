Shakarian\n\nVladimir Mayakovsky Photograph of Vladimir Mayakovsky from the first edition\nof the Great Soviet Encyclopedia Source: Great Soviet Encyclopedia\n\nIn the fateful year of 1917, the Bolshevik Revolution shook Russia and forever\nchanged the world. Its impact left an indelible mark not only on the political\nhistory of the 20th century, but also on art, culture, film, and literature.\nPerhaps one of the greatest exponents of the new Russian Revolutionary\nzeitgeist was the poet, playwright, and artist Vladimir Mayakovsky, whose\nthunderous verse and visually arresting Cubo-Futurist agitprop shook the world\nas much as the history that surrounded him.\n\nIt was in 1925 that the poet brought his gospel of revolutionary futurism to\nthe working class of the great urban centers of America, including Cleveland.\nHe was not the first prominent Russian to visit the Forest City \u2013 Anna\nPavlova, Sergei Diaghilev, Vaslav Nijinsky, Feodor Chaliapin, and Sergei\nYesenin had already beat him to the punch. However, Mayakovsky\u2019s visit would\nstand as one of the more significant, underscoring Cleveland\u2019s position not\nonly as a fast-growing and densely populated industrial metropolis, but also\nas a hotbed for left-wing labor activism.\n\nMayakovsky was born on July 19, 1893, to a Russian family in Baghdati,\nGeorgia, near the city of Kutaisi, then part of the Imperial Russian Caucasus.\nThe family later moved to Moscow where the rebellious Mayakovsky became\nincreasingly drawn to the ideals of revolutionary socialism and Marxism. In\nMarch 1908, when he was not yet 15, he was arrested for the first time for\npossessing radical literature in a police raid on an underground printing\nhouse.\n\nIn 1911, Mayakovsky was admitted to the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture\nand Architecture. It was there, under the influence of the futurist artist\nDavid Burliuk, that he embraced poetry as his full-time passion and indeed,\nhis fate. Then, only few years later, in 1915, the poet met his great love and\nmuse, Lilya Brik. However, for the restless revolutionary, she was one of many\nwomen with whom he was passionately involved.\n\nIn 1917, Mayakovsky became an eyewitness to the revolutionary events in\nPetrograd and \u201centered the revolution as one would enter his own home,\u201d in the\nwords of the writer Viktor Shklovsky. Plunging headlong into the new\nrevolutionary fervor sweeping the arts, Mayakovsky soon became a favorite with\nthe Russian public, a status solidified by his authorship of the epic poem\n150,000,000. He collaborated with many Russian artists and writers in the\nperiod of Lenin\u2019s New Economic Policy (NEP), most prominently the great\ngraphic artist and photographer Aleksandr Rodchenko and the celebrated avant-\ngardist El Lissitzky. The poet also rose to renown as a prominent member of\nLEF, the Left Art Front. Meanwhile, Lenin\u2019s own taste in art was more\nconservative in comparison, and the Soviet leader himself even referred to\nMayakovsky, in a tongue-in-cheek way, as a \u201chooligan communist.\u201d\n\nThe thunderous Mayakovsky soon sought to preach his revolutionary futurism\nabroad, traveling to France, Cuba, Mexico (where he dined with muralist Diego\nRivera), and eventually the United States. In the latter, Mayakovsky traveled\nto the great urban centers of the Northeast and the Great Lakes \u2013 New York,\nCleveland, Detroit, Chicago, Pittsburgh, and Philadelphia. In all these\ncities, he sought to bring his revolutionary gospel to the tired, poor, and\nhuddled working masses of America. He also planned a stop in Boston that was\nultimately unrealized. On the side, he engaged in a passionate romantic affair\nwith Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 Elly Jones and had just enough time for a reunion with his\nmentor Burliuk, who was then living in the Bronx. In Manhattan, the Russian\nMayakovsky even reportedly surprised one of his audiences by addressing them\nin Georgian, a language that he picked up in his youth.\n\nMayakovsky fell in love with New York and the city left the greatest\nimpression on the poet. However, he was also spellbound by urban Americana in\ngeneral, expressing at once admiration and disgust with what he observed in\nhis later account, Moe otkrytie Ameriki (My Discovery of America). Cleveland,\nthen America's fifth largest city and fast approaching a population of one\nmillion people, was to be the poet\u2019s first stop after the Big Apple. There the\npoet spoke on September 29, 1925, at 8 PM at the Carpenters\u2019 Union Hall at\n2226 East 55th in the Cedar\u2013Central neighborhood, in the shadow of the city\u2019s\ndowntown. The event was sponsored by the Russian and Jewish departments of the\nWorkers Party of America (an earlier name for the Communist Party USA).\nAdmission was 50 cents.\n\nA Russian-language blurb in the New York-based paper Novyi Mir announced the\nCleveland event as follows: \u201cHey Clevelander, listen up! The theatre is not\ngoing anywhere! The movies are not going anywhere! Your acquaintances are not\ngoing anywhere! But MAYAKOVSKY will be departing for the USSR. However, before\nhe leaves, he will be visiting CLEVELAND.\u201d The advertisement advised readers\nnot to miss Mayakovsky\u2019s appearance at the hall, noting that the poet would be\ndelivering both a poetry recitation and a lecture. Similarly, the leftist\nJewish newspaper Freigait noted that Mayakovsky would be reciting \"his best\nworks with his usual mastery.\"\n\nOn September 26, The Daily Worker further noted that not only was Mayakovsky\nto give a \u201cproletarian culture lecture,\u201d but that he would also update the\naudience on the latest avant-garde trends in Soviet literature. The blurb also\nemphasized that \u201call Russian speaking workers\u201d were invited to attend the\nevent. Naturally, there were many individuals fitting this description in\nCleveland, which at the time boasted a foreign-born population of 30%.\nMoreover, the political upheavals of the First Red Scare would have still been\nfresh in the minds of many Clevelanders, including the violent May Day Riots\nof 1919.\n\nUnfortunately for today\u2019s historians, Mayakovsky\u2019s visit was not covered in\nthe major Cleveland newspapers, and no account of his Forest City recitation\nhas been preserved. The Carpenters\u2019 Union Hall where Mayakovsky spoke was a\nlarge building that originally housed the Fraternal Order of Eagles in\nCleveland. By 1924, the ownership had changed, and the structure was purchased\nby the Local 1750 United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners and became the\nJewish Carpenters\u2019 Union Hall. Its patrons were not exclusively Jewish and\nradical activists from other ethnic groups also advertised events held at the\nvenue. In September 1925, for example, the Cleveland-based Czech socialist\npaper Americk\u00e9 d\u011blnick\u00e9 listy advertised the visit of British Labour\npolitician Rennie Smith at the hall. The venue also hosted sporting events,\nincluding the early basketball tournaments of the Cleveland Rosenblums, the\ncity\u2019s first major basketball team.\n\nIn subsequent years, 2226 East 55th changed hands multiple times, and by the\nearly 1930s, it assumed the identity of a nightclub and dance hall known as\nthe \u201cCotton Club,\u201d hosting popular jazz orchestras, such as those of Don\nRedman and Fletcher Henderson. By the late 1940s, the building was rebranded\nagain as \u201cParadise Auditorium.\u201d In 1949 and again in 1952, singer and civil\nrights activist Paul Robeson performed there, and in October 1965, future\nCleveland Mayor Carl B. Stokes, who was inspired by Robeson to go into\npolitics, delivered some of his earliest campaign speeches at the auditorium,\nonly a few decades before its demolition.\n\nAlthough no accounts survive of Mayakovsky\u2019s poetry recitation at 2226 East\n55th, he did return to the USSR with a flyer in memory of the event, titled\n\"Unbelieveable in Cleveland\" (Nebyvaloe v Klivlende), which is now held at the\nState Literature Museum of Russia in Moscow. He also left us with his\nimpressions of the 1920s skyscraper boom that swept up urban America,\nincluding Cleveland. \u201cAll America, and New York in particular, is under\nconstruction, under interminable construction,\u201d he wrote in his Discovery of\nAmerica. \u201cTen-storey buildings are pulled apart to build twenty-storey ones;\ntwenty-storey ones for thirty-storey ones \u2013 for forty and so on.\u201d\n\nAs an example of this high-rise fever, Mayakovsky noted that just as he began\nto \u201creact with a sort of poetic inspiration to some twenty-storey Cleveland\nhotel,\u201d locals began complaining that the building\u2019s placement was \u201ccrowding\nus,\u201d like commuters on a streetcar. \u201cAnd so, they\u2019re just relocating it, ten\nblocks away, to the lake,\u201d Mayakovsky wrote, incredulously. \u201cI don\u2019t know\nprecisely who will be relocating this building, or how, but if a thing like\nthat slips from their hands, it will trample a lot of corns.\u201d\n\nMayakovsky\u2019s passage invites some curiosity. At the time of his visit, a\nprominent twenty-story Cleveland hotel was indeed under construction and close\nto completion \u2013 the Cleveland Allerton, at the corner of Chester and East\n13th. That hotel was officially opened the following year, in November 1926.\nHowever, the futurist\u2019s claim about the proposed relocation of the high-rise\nstructure to the Lake Erie shore was undoubtedly an exaggeration and most\ncertainly the result of a misunderstanding.\n\nIn a passage that Mayakovsky later cut from the final edition of his work, he\nalso condemned the conditions of poor African American families living in\nabject poverty alongside the streetcar line on Cleveland\u2019s Near East Side. He\nidentified them as workers from the \u201cRockefeller oil refineries\u201d living in\nshanty towns in what he described as an \u201cimmense ditch\u201d and \u201cwithout any hope,\nunder the current American conditions, to climb into something better.\u201d\nWriting of the inequality facing these men and women, the working poor of\nAmerica, he remarked, \u201cthe small standardized suburban house is the Winter\nPalace compared to their dwellings.\u201d\n\nMayakovsky\u2019s American trip represented the apogee of his success as a poet and\npublic persona. By contrast, the latter 1920s proved difficult for the\nrebellious futurist as he became increasingly disillusioned with the direction\nof the USSR under Lenin\u2019s successor, Joseph Stalin. Mayakovsky\u2019s work began to\nface increasing criticism and his final plays \u2013 The Bedbug and The Bathhouse \u2013\nwere flops. Meanwhile, his personal life was marred by an unhappy romance with\na Moscow actress.\n\nThis series of unfortunate events eventually culminated in Mayakovsky\u2019s\napparent suicide on April 14, 1930 \u2013 the circumstances of which continue to\nelicit much debate and discussion in contemporary post-Soviet Russia. Yet,\ndespite his death, Mayakovsky\u2019s towering influence on literature and the\ngraphic arts continues to live on. His work remains widely read across Russia\nand the former Soviet Union, and beyond.\n\n## Images\n\nVladimir Mayakovsky Photograph of Vladimir Mayakovsky from the first edition\nof the Great Soviet Encyclopedia Source: Great Soviet EncyclopediaMayakovsky's\nMy Discovery of America Aleksandr Rodchenko's cover design for the first\nedition of Mayakovsky's Moe otkrytie Ameriki (My Discovery of America) Source:\nNational Library of Russia, St. Petersburg Creator: Aleksandr Rodchenko Date:\n1926Poetry Reading Advertisement Russian-language advertisement for\nMayakovsky's poetry reading in Cleveland in Novyi Mir newspaper, New York, NY,\n26 September 1925.
