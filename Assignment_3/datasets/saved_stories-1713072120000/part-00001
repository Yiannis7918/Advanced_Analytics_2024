It is the\nfirst time that Iran has launched an attack on Israel from Iranian soil,\nIsraeli officials said. Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said the\nattack also included missiles.\n\nU.S. forces in the region were active in shooting down drones, a U.S. defense\nofficial said. By the early hours of Sunday morning, interceptions by Israel's\nanti-missile defense system were seen over populous areas including Tel Aviv\nand Jerusalem.\n\nThe Israeli emergency medical service Magen David Adom reported at least one\nperson was injured: a 10-year-old child in critical condition in the area of\nArad, a town near the southwestern edge of the Dead Sea.\n\nSaturday's attack, which was first announced by Israeli officials around 4\np.m. ET, was staged in waves and took hours to reach Israel, officials said.\nIsraeli military spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari warned Israelis to stay\nin safe rooms for 10 minutes when sirens sounded, and he said that Israel had\nturned off GPS capabilities across the country.\n\nRelated Story: How Iran and Israel became archenemies\n\nIn a statement broadcast on Iranian state television, Iran's Islamic\nRevolutionary Guard Corps described the attack as a \"large-scale military\noperation\" against multiple targets inside Israel.\n\nIn a post on the social media site X, Iran's permanent mission to the United\nNations wrote that the attack was a direct response to the strike on the\nconsulate and that \"the matter can be deemed concluded.\"\n\n\"However, should the Israeli regime make another mistake, Iran's response will\nbe considerably more severe,\" the statement continued. \"It is a conflict\nbetween Iran and the rogue Israeli regime, from which the U.S. MUST STAY\nAWAY!\"\n\nMore than 100 drones were launched by Iran, an Israeli military spokesperson\ntold reporters. In response, Israel had positioned tens of aircraft in order\nto counter the attack and would \"do our best to intercept them before they\nreach Israel,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe U.S. military was directly involved in the response, a U.S. defense\nofficial said. \"In accordance with our ironclad commitment to Israel's\nsecurity, U.S. forces in the region continue to shoot down Iranian-launched\ndrones targeting Israel. Our forces remain postured to provide additional\ndefensive support and to protect U.S. forces operating in the region,\" the\nperson said.\n\n### Israelis were urged to take shelter\n\nOfficials in Israel had explicitly urged residents of Nevatim, Dimona and\nEilat \u2014 three cities in Israel's Negev desert region \u2014 and people in the\nnorthern occupied Golan Heights to take shelter. A major Israeli air base is\nlocated near Nevatim, and an Israeli nuclear research facility is located in\nDimona.\n\nAirspace over Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon was closed late Saturday.\n\nHezbollah, the Lebanon-based militant group, said that it had staged its own\nattack by launching dozens of rockets toward an Israeli military base in the\nGolan early Sunday.\n\nIn a Saturday night address to Israelis, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin\nNetanyahu said that his country was ready for \"any scenario, both defensively\nand offensively.\"\n\n\"We have determined a clear principle: Whoever harms us, we will harm them. We\nwill defend ourselves against any threat and will do so level-headedly and\nwith determination,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nThe launch was also confirmed by the White House, where a spokesperson said\nPresident Biden would monitor the attack from the Situation Room alongside top\ndefense and diplomatic officials.\n\n\"President Biden has been clear: our support for Israel's security is\nironclad,\" said National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson. \"The\nUnited States will stand with the people of Israel and support their defense\nagainst these threats from Iran.\"\n\n### Iran blames Israel for an earlier attack on its consulate\n\nThe attack on Israel comes four days after Iran's leader Ayatollah Ali\nKhamenei vowed retaliation for an April 1 strike on an Iranian consulate in\nthe Syrian capital of Damascus. Iran said the strike killed seven members of\nIran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, including two generals, and it blamed Israel\nfor the attack. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied being behind the\nattack.\n\nBy Saturday, as anticipation had grown over a possible retaliation, Israeli\nofficials warned residents living in communities near Gaza and the Lebanon\nborder to limit the size of gatherings and to work indoors or within reach of\na shelter. Schools across Israel were closed through Monday.\n\nRelated Story: Iranian officials accuse Israel of a deadly attack on Iran's\nconsulate in Syria\n\n\"Iran is a terrorist state \u2014 the world is seeing this now more than ever,\"\nIsrael's defense minister Yoav Gallant said Saturday, hours before the launch.\n\"We are determined to defend our citizens against this terrorism, and we know\nhow to respond to it.\"\n\nIn anticipation of the attack, President Biden had cut short a trip to\nDelaware in order to return to the White House Saturday. \"We are devoted to\nthe defense of Israel. We will support Israel. We will help defend Israel. And\nIran will not succeed,\" Biden said Friday.\n\nU.S. defense officials told NPR Saturday that the U.S. military had moved\nassets around the region in anticipation of an attack, including aircraft, and\nhad shored up defensive positions for forces in the region. The top U.S.\nmilitary commander in the Middle East, Gen. Michael Kurilla, arrived in Israel\nThursday to coordinate with the Israeli military.\n\n### The attack is a large escalation of hostilities in the region\n\nThe strike and retaliation represent an escalation of conflict in the region\nthat many officials worldwide had expressed worry about ever since the\noutbreak of war between Israel and the Gaza-based militant group Hamas on Oct.\n7, the day Hamas led an attack on Israel that left some 1,200 people dead.\n\nIn a statement released late Saturday, Egypt's foreign affairs ministry called\nIran's attack a \"dangerous escalation\" and urged \"the exercise of the utmost\nrestraint to spare the region and its people further factors of instability\nand tension.\"\n\nIran has long supplied Hamas with funds and weapons. The White House has not\ndirectly linked Iran to the Oct. 7 attack.\n\nRelated Story: Biden returns to D.C. a day early to consult national security\nteam on Iran-Israel row\n\nIn the six months since Oct. 7, Israel has bombarded Gaza and conducted a\ndevastating ground invasion that has left much of the territory in ruins and\nmore than 33,000 Palestinians dead, according to Palestinian health officials.\n\nThe last time Iran launched a similar attack was in 2020, when it fired\nballistic missiles at the Ain al-Asad Air Base in Iraq, wounding dozens of\nU.S. troops, in retaliation for the killing of Iranian general Qassem\nSoleimani by a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad.\n\n\u00a9 NPR\n\n", "frontpage": false}
