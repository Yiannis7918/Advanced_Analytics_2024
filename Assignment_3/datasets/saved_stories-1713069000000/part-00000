There, he figured out how to express the perplexing\nspectroscopic observations of atoms \u2013 whereby they absorbed and emitted light\nat well-defined, characteristic frequencies \u2013 in mathematical form.\nHeisenberg\u2019s mentor, Danish physicist Niels Bohr, had proposed that the\nspectra could be understood on the assumption that an atom\u2019s electrons may\npossess only specific energies, switching from one energy level to another by\nemitting or absorbing a single \u201cquantum\u201d of light with an energy proportional\nto its frequency. That quantum hypothesis for light had been proposed by\nAlbert Einstein in 1905, and Bohr had developed it into a new theory of the\natom \u2013 albeit one that made no sense in classical terms.\n\nBy expressing the permitted energies of these \u201cquantum jumps\u201d as a matrix of\nexperimentally observed values, Heisenberg transformed the ad hoc, nascent\nquantum theory into a genuine quantum mechanics. His matrix algebra implied\nthat it was not possible to simultaneously know both the position and the\nmomentum of a particle with arbitrary accuracy. This \u201cuncertainty principle\u201d\nsuggested that quantum physics imposed limits on the knowledge we can have\nabout the atomic world.\n\nBohr, Heisenberg and their collaborators in Copenhagen went on to argue that\nthis restriction is fundamental. It is not that we are doomed to remain\nignorant about exactly how things are, but rather that there is no meaningful\n\u201chow things are\u201d until they are measured. The suggestion sparked a good-\nnatured but trenchant argument between Bohr and Einstein that lasted for much\nof their shared lifetime. \u201cEinstein could not make the concession. It would\nrub out separate, individual objects, essential traits of an acceptable world\npicture,\u201d write John Heilbron and Jim Baggott in their new book Quantum Drama:\nFrom the Bohr-Einstein Debate to the Riddle of Entanglement. Baggott, a\nphysicist and science writer, and Heilbron, a historian of science who died in\n2023, tell the history of quantum mechanics, from its inception to today\u2019s\ncutting edge of quantum information technology.\n\nFriendly foes Whilst at the 1930 Solvay Conference in Belgium, Albert Einstein\nconfronted Niels Bohr with a paradoxical thought experiment. (Courtesy: CC-BY-\nSA-2.0/PIXEL17.com)\n\nEinstein never tired of concocting new objections to the \u201cCopenhagen\u201d view. At\nthe Solvay Conference of 1930 in Belgium, which brought together the leading\nphysicists of the day, he confronted Bohr with a paradoxical thought\nexperiment involving a heavy box hanging from a spring, containing a photon\n(that escapes) and a fixed clock. Bohr produced a response to the puzzle that\nassuaged many doubts but seems not to have satisfied Bohr himself. \u201cHe fretted\nover it for the rest of his life,\u201d say Heilbron and Baggott. \u201cA rough sketch\nof the apparatus was on his blackboard the day he died.\u201d\n\nEinstein\u2019s opposition exposed the deeply counterintuitive nature of quantum\nmechanics \u2013 most famously in a thought experiment devised in 1935 with his\nyounger colleagues Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen. This \u201cEPR\n[Einstein\u2013Podolsky\u2013Rosen] experiment\u201d showed that, once two particles have\ninteracted, quantum mechanics seemed to insist that their properties\nthereafter remain interdependent, such that a measurement elicits impossible\ninstantaneous signalling between the two. Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, who shared\nEinstein\u2019s antipathy to the Copenhagen view, named this effect \u201centanglement\u201d.\n\nTo Einstein, the EPR paradox could be resolved only by assuming that the\nentangled particles had fixed properties all along, albeit ones that were\nunobservable and thus characterized by \u201chidden variables\u201d. The problem was\nthat both Bohr\u2019s and Einstein\u2019s interpretations made identical experimental\npredictions. With no obvious way to resolve the question, it was set aside,\nand many researchers in the 1940s and 1950s deemed such \u201cfoundational\u201d\nquestions pointless or even unseemly. Who cared, when quantum mechanics worked\nso well in practice? This was the attitude famously characterized by American\nphysicist David Mermin as \u201cshut up and calculate\u201d, which was particularly\ndominant in the pragmatic US. Taking an interest in such issues could be\ntantamount to career suicide. \u201cYou\u2019ll never get a PhD if you allow yourself to\nbe distracted by such frivolities,\u201d Mermin was told at Harvard, according to\nthe book. He remarks that \u201cit was a very unphilosophical time\u201d.\n\n> Nobel laureate Murray Gell-Mann charged Bohr with having brainwashed a\n> generation of physicists into thinking that the puzzles of quantum mechanics\n> had all been long solved\n\nIn her 1999 book Quantum Dialogue, historian of science Mara Beller accused\nBohr and his colleagues of imposing their Copenhagen orthodoxy and\nmarginalizing or ridiculing alternative interpretations such as David Bohm\u2019s\n\u201cpilot waves\u201d and Hugh Everett\u2019s \u201cuniversal wavefunction\u201d, also known as the\n\u201cmany worlds\u201d interpretation of quantum mechanics. Nobel laureate Murray Gell-\nMann charged Bohr with having brainwashed a generation of physicists into\nthinking that the puzzles of quantum mechanics had all been long solved. But\nHeilbron and Baggott show that it\u2019s fairer to lay the blame on the apathy of\nthe community at large. As Paul Dirac said of the theory\u2019s metaphysical\nconundrums: \u201cMany people live long and fruitful lives without ever worrying\nabout [them].\u201d\n\nRead more\n\n####\n\nThirty years of \u2018against measurement\u2019\n\nThat attitude began to change, however, in 1964 when the Northern Irish\nphysicist John Bell figured out a way to distinguish the so-called hidden-\nvariables models from no-frills quantum mechanics. All it needed was some\nserious thought \u2013 \u201cThere was nothing in Bell\u2019s inequality that was not known\nto the quantum founders,\u201d the authors say.\n\nIronically, Bell came up with his celebrated test because he wanted to find a\nflaw in Bohrian quantum mechanics. So did the first person to conduct the test\nexperimentally, John Clauser, working with Stuart Freedman at the University\nof California at Berkeley. Yet that experiment, and the many others later\ncarried out, have unfailingly supported quantum mechanics alone and ruled out\nany hidden variables \u2013 at least those that apply locally to assign each\nparticle fixed properties at a given position before measurement. (That does\nnot mean Bohr is right, although it seems nearly impossible to salvage\nEinstein\u2019s position.) The book gives a superb account of the resurgence of\ninterest in quantum foundations that followed from the work of Bell and\nClauser, involving in particular Clauser\u2019s fellow 2022 Nobel laureates Anton\nZeilinger and Alain Aspect. Far from being empty philosophizing, such studies\nnow undergird technologies such as quantum computing and quantum cryptography.\n\nQuantum Drama tells a complex story with a vast cast. While the authors\nsometimes demand a lot from their readers, I have never read a better account:\nbalanced, authoritative and spiced with elegant wit. Describing a trip to\nJapan made by several of the early quantum pioneers, Heilbron and Baggott\ndescribe how on a walk past a pagoda \u201cHeisenberg spontaneously climbed it and,\nstanding on its very apex (width \u2206q) on one foot in a howling wind, happily\nmaintained an uncertainty \u2206p too small to knock him over.\u201d\n\nThis book won\u2019t be all things to all people. As with Heilbron\u2019s earlier book\nNiels Bohr: A Very Short Introduction, its description of the Bohr atom is so\ntechnical as to be nigh impenetrable to all but specialists, creating a\nformidable hurdle so early in the book. And there are other occasions, such as\nin the descriptions of Bell tests, where one longs for a pithy summary of\nqualitative meaning among the details. At times the reader is thrown a\nsuccession of comments from experts without much indication of how to navigate\ntheir contradictions.\n\nBut if this makes the book occasionally challenging for the general reader,\nthe payoff for perseverance is considerable. As the author of a popular-level\naccount of quantum mechanics, I hesitate to suggest leaving such efforts aside\nin favour of this more substantial volume \u2013 but I would certainly recommend\ntreating all such accounts with caution until you have read this one.\n\n  * 2024 Oxford University Press 352pp \u00a325hb\n\nPhilip Ball is a science writer based in the UK, whose latest book is How Life\nWorks (2024), e-mail p.ball@btinternet.com\n\n### Physics World Careers\n\nProviding valuable careers advice and a comprehensive employer directory\n\nRead previous\n\n  * Quantum\n  * Opinion and reviews\n\n#### Africa's quantum future offers a beacon of hope\n\n## Discover more from Physics World\n\n    * Quantum mechanics\n    * Research update\n\n### Giant quantum tornado behaves like a black hole in miniature\n\n    * Quantum\n    * News\n\n### MEPs call for \u2018urgent action\u2019 to implement post-quantum encryption\nstandards\n\n    * Quantum\n    * Blog\n\n### Get set for World Quantum Day 2024\n\n## Related jobs\n\n  * United Kingdom | QinetiQ\n\n#### Senior Quantum Scientist\n\n  * Germany | Karlsruhe Institute of Technology\n\n#### University Professorship (W3) \"Quantum Materials\"\n\n  * Broomfield | Quantinuum US\n\n#### Principle Physicist\n\n## Related events\n\n  * Quantum | Conference IQT The Hague 22\u201424 April 2024 | The Hague, Netherlands\n  * Quantum | Conference Quantum.Tech USA 24\u201426 April 2024 | Washington DC, US\n  * Quantum | Conference IQT Vancouver-Pacific Rim 4\u20146 June 2024 | Vancouver, Canada\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 by IOP Publishing Ltd and individual contributors\n\n#### Explore Physics World\n\n  * About us\n  * Our team\n  * Our portfolio\n  * Advertising\n  * Contact us\n  * Feedback\n  * Sign in\n  * Register\n\n#### MORE INFORMATION\n\n  * Institute of Physics\n  * Join the Institute\n  * Modern Slavery Act\n  * Privacy and Cookies\n  * IOP Publishing\n  * Copyright\n  * Terms and Conditions\n  * Disclaimer\n\n#### OUR MISSION\n\nPhysics World represents a key part of IOP Publishing's mission to communicate\nworld-class research and innovation to the widest possible audience.
