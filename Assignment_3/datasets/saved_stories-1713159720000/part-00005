It inspired me to improve my resume. I am\nadding substance to it in the long term by doing a computer science degree and\nopen-source. But, there is also something to do in the short-term by working\non the packaging. Now you can also have your own beautiful resume website for\nfree and I will show you how.\n\n##\n\n1\\. Fork the repository\n\nGo to this link and fork the repository. Cloning the repository will not be\nenough. Forking the repository will be important for the deployment at step 5.\n\n##\n\n2\\. Add you information\n\nClone the forked repository locally to start adding changes. Open the\ndata.json file and insert your information. You can also remove or add\nsections. You can change the titles and the labels. Make it your own.\n\n##\n\n3\\. Customise\n\nWhen you open the main.js file, the first thing you will see is the banner.\nYou can make your own here. When adding your banner, make sure to keep the\nsame quotes and to keep String.raw.\n\nNext, you can open the main.css file to choose your colours. To see how your\nwebsite will look, you can open the index.html file with live server on vs\ncode.\n\n##\n\n4\\. Push to Github\n\nOnce you feel comfortable with the way your website looks, push the latest\nchanges to GitHub.\n\n##\n\n5\\. Deploy on Digital Ocean for free\n\nOnce you create a digital ocean account, go to app platform and create an app.\n\nThen, you can choose GitHub.\n\nNext, you might have to edit the GitHub permission to be able to see the\nrepository we pushed earlier.\n\nSelect the repository. Once it\u2019s done, the only thing to do is to click \u201cnext\u201d\non the following pages and finally \u201ccreate resources\u201c. You will find the URL\nto the deployed app at the top of the app platform page. Every time you push\non the main branch, it will automatically deploy the changes.
