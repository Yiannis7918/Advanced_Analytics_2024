Perfectly in keeping with his restless, artistically\nambitious yet self-deprecating character, Rossellini afterwards expressed a\nfair amount of ambivalence toward that film, despite its indisputable success.\nIt wasn\u2019t too much further along into his career that the great pioneer of\nNeorealism, after proving that he could crank out a hit movie if he really\nwanted to, finally turned his back on commercial aspirations, choosing instead\nto produce films on his own terms that attempted to elevate the consciousness\nand inform the intellect of his audience, or at least those who chose to make\nthe effort to follow wherever his vision led.\n\nSince I enjoyed Il Generale Della Rovere, I was curious to see just what kind\nof new directions Rossellini had in mind for the final phase of his life\u2019s\nwork. To discover what he was aiming for, I turned to Eclipse Series 14:\nRossellini\u2019s History Films \u2013 Renaissance and Enlightenment, which contains\nthree of his last productions, shot in the early 1970s. And when I saw that\none of the made-for-TV programs in that box featured a musical soundtrack\ncomposed by Manuel de Sica, son of the great Vittorio de Sica who played Il\nGenerale, that just sealed the deal. I knew I had to make a pilgrimage in\ntime, back to The Age of the Medici.\n\nSince I\u2019d already watched and reviewed Cartesius, one of the other titles in\nthis set last October, I already had some idea of what I was in for: a drily\nperformed, historically detailed and highly literate re-enactments of pivotal\nepisodes in the unfolding of European civilization, especially in regard to\nthe development of the \u201cbig ideas\u201d that shaped the modern society we now take\nfor granted. True to the convictions of a man who could state sincerely that\n\u201ccinema is dead,\u201d Rossellini made no attempt in these films to stir our\nemotions or hook us in via charismatic personalities, dramatic narrative\ntwists or any of the usual ploys that gratify the crowds. He knew, with\nsupreme confidence, that the subjects of his study were important in their own\nright, with little need for manipulative embellishments. If that significance\nwas not readily self-evident to members of his audience, he was content to let\nthem go their own way, distracting themselves with their banal entertainments\nuntil they were capable of recognizing the value of the hefty substance he\nplaced before them. And if that sounds haughty, arrogant, pretentious to you,\nthen go ahead and stop reading right now. You\u2019re just not ready to dig into\nRossellini\u2019s History films, let me be the first to tell you.\n\nOf course, summing up the conflicts of an era as complex and multi-faceted as\nthe emergence of what we now refer to as The Renaissance in 15th century\nFlorence, Italy requires a large canvas, which is why Rossellini delivers this\nhistory in a video approximation of one of the favored artistic formats of\nthat era, the triptych. The Age of the Medici is a three-part TV miniseries of\nsorts, each episode focusing our gaze on an important element of a larger\nstory. Part 1, \u201cThe Exile of Cosimo,\u201d chronicles the rise of Cosimo de Medici,\nhead of a prominent merchant family whose uncanny business sense enlarged his\nfortune to the point where he was able to wield massive power, not through the\nauthority of the church or the raw military power exercised by princes, but\nthrough the uniquely persuasive effects of cold hard cash. The series opens\nwith Cosimo attending his father\u2019s funeral, learning the terms of his\ninheritance and then swiftly setting in motion the machinations to put that\nmoney to work, advancing his influence, and in the process, all of human\ncivilization. The Medici were forerunners of today\u2019s ultrarich, able to bend\nthe forces of law, politics, religion, art, culture and even science in ways\nthat favored their ambitions and solidified their grip on power.\n\nOf course, no would-be giant among men makes his way to the top without facing\nhis share of formidable obstacles, and Cosimo found his adversary in Rinaldo\ndegli Albizzi, head of the rival Florentine clan who mistrusted the Medicis\u2019\nmotives and sought the means to cast them as disreputable, or even criminals,\nif they could only find appropriately damning evidence to back up their\nsuspicions.\n\nBut before we get into a necessarily brief recap of the storyline, a few words\nare in order about the verisimilitude with which Rossellini captures the\nspirit of old Florence. As the screencaps show, he had to resort to some\ncreative-but-cheap special effects that some might find cheesy but I consider\nadmirable. Clearly working on a limited budget, Rossellini had no ability to\nbuilt suitably convincing replicas of either the Florentine skyline circa 1430\nor the several stages of progress achieved in Cosimo\u2019s lifetime on the facade\nand dome of the Basilica Santa Maria del Fiore. So he resorted to hand-painted\n2-D mockups that don\u2019t really convince anyone, but they\u2019re brave efforts in\nany case. Watching the cathedral transition from rough wooden structure to\nsomething resembling the ornate extravagance we\u2019ve come to associate with the\nRenaissance over the course of four and a half hours is one of the small\npleasures I enjoyed. And don\u2019t worry, there are more than enough authentic\nexamples of period architecture and costumery to satisfy Renaissance purists.\nThough Rossellini doesn\u2019t allow his camera to revel in the scenery the way a\ndirector like Franco Zeffirelli did, I have no complaints; the settings are\noften quite wonderful to behold.\n\nA main theme of the series is the slipperiness and malleability of supposedly\neternal principles like law and ethics. This dialog-heavy script requires some\nclose listening and even supplemental reading in order to pick up all the\nnuances it contains. The gist of it though is how increasingly sophisticated\n(or you could say, hypocritical) the various powers-that-be are forced to\nbecome in order to maintain the appearance of respect for ancient religious\ntraditions (for example, the prohibitions against usury) while crafting legal\nloopholes such as those allowing merchants to operate pawn shops. Those who\nhave agreed to pay a financial penalty and assume the social status of moral\nreprobates are signified by a red drape on their storefront, in effect given\nlegal permission to break sacred law, reaping tidy profits for both\nentrepreneurs and the city fathers, and leaving matters of conscience to the\nindividual shopkeepers to sort out for themselves.\n\nBuilding on such evasive tricks so neatly woven into the emerging economic\norder, the stage is set to observe how Cosimo maneuvers his way through the\nlegal, religious and political snares set before him. When his capitalistic\ninstincts lead him to oppose a conflict between Florence and a neighboring\ncity-state (because war is bad for business), he\u2019s scapegoated by the Albizzis\nafter the battle goes poorly and the Florentine forces are routed. Cosimo is\nsummoned to appear before the Signoria, the local council of magistrates,\nwhere he faces certain arrest, imprisonment and possible execution. But Cosimo\nunwaveringly faces his accusers, intently pursuing a high-stakes experiment to\nsee if his economic clout is able to produce the results he thinks it ought.\n\nAnd so it turns out that, even within the confines of his lonesome prison\ncell, Cosimo somehow has the means to arrange for a messenger to visit his\ncaptor and drop off a gift, a simple leather bag stuffed with gold coins. And\nwouldn\u2019t you know, in the very next scene, prisoner and magistrate are seated\nat the same table, passing knives back and forth to each other, warmly\nnegotiating the terms of a settlement bound to disappoint those who thought\nthey\u2019d seen the last of Cosimo as a free and living man.\n\nIt may be worth pointing out that The Age of the Medici was broadcast in 1972,\nthe same year that Francis Ford Coppola released The Godfather. Perhaps its no\ncoincidence that the stories of these two prominent Italian families, known\nfor using both legitimate and ruthless means of establishing their fortunes,\nboth came out around the same time? There\u2019s certainly enough of a Mafioso\nflavor in Cosimo\u2019s smooth criminality to make the mental connection for many\nviewers, especially in the scene above, when the word vendetta is used to\ndescribe the punishment meted out on a poor soul who broke the code of honor\nby sharing silk-weaving secrets with others outside their ancient and\nnotoriously secretive guild.\n\nAnd just as central as economics and politics are to Rossellini\u2019s ideas, so\nalso art figures prominently in the story of the emerging Medici dynasty.\nEpisode 2, \u201cThe Power of Cosimo,\u201d depicts his return from exile in Venice,\nmore coldly calculating and relentlessly ambitious after a few years spent\nplotting his ever-so-respectably applied revenge. Though Cosimo\u2019s not beyond\nenforcing compliance through the administration of pain, he\u2019d much rather get\nhis point across building sublime monuments and establishing himself as a\nprominent patron of the arts. And what a time to be in that business, as the\nItalian Renaissance was about to burst into full bloom. Massacio\u2019s \u201cExpulsion\nfrom Eden\u201d and Donatello\u2019s statue of King David are just two of the famous\nmasterpieces put into historical context, enabling us to see the works as\nsomething beyond merely fancy ornaments as they\u2019re often regarded nowadays.\nThe locals respond to them with indignation and confusion, unsettled by\ninnovative, sensual details that call older traditions into question. We\u2019re\nreminded that progress in the visual arts is not simply an exploration of\naesthetic vanities, then or now. Each breakthrough, each shifting perspective\nin the portrayal of the human figure, carries with it larger implications\nabout how we regard and value life, and how we understand our place in the\ncosmos.\n\nBut before we lose ourselves entirely in ponderous highbrow musings,\nRossellini injects moments of visceral brutality to keep our feet firmly\nplanted on the ground. Art, architecture, philosophy and religion may all seek\nin their own way to inspire heavenly meditations, but there\u2019s still a dark,\ndirty, competitive world we each live in that has to be reckoned with as well.\n\nEpisode 3 shifts the focus away from Cosimo (though he still plays an\nimportant part) and on to another important Renaissance figure, \u201cLeon Battista\nAlberti: Humanist.\u201d This final installment is the most philosophically dense\nof the three, and one that I recommend to anyone who\u2019s looking for a well-\nrounded overview of the mindset of that era. Here Rossellini really indulges\nhis appetite for extended rhetorical exchanges, with characters routinely\ntossing out profundities and speculations that are worth pausing the DVD to\nponder a bit before proceeding on to the next priceless nugget of insight. Of\ncourse, some of the philosophical musings that so preoccupied these men (and\nthis is, for sure, a man\u2019s world on screen; women are almost entirely silent\nduring the scarce moments when they even appear) may not be so relevant for\nmany viewers, but for those whose taste in movies runs toward the cerebral and\nanalytical, I think there\u2019s a lot to chew on here, and it makes these discs\nvery rewatchable if you\u2019re into that sort of thing. Here\u2019s a sampler if you\nwant to have a taste. There\u2019s even a sly bit about the first \u201cmotion pictures\u201d\naround the 6:30 mark!\n\nOne thing I will add here is that even though the default setting for the DVDs\nis Italian, there\u2019s absolutely no reason why an English-speaking viewer should\nwatch it with subtitles instead of the dubbed English audio track, unless you\njust enjoy the sound of people speaking the language native to that setting.\nThe program was originally filmed in English, in the hopes that it could be\nsold to a forerunner of today\u2019s PBS TV network. That plan fell through, so\nthey dubbed an Italian language track over the top, and then re-dubbed an\nEnglish track later on when it eventually was picked up for American\ndistribution. The net effect is that the English dub actually syncs better\nwith the actors\u2019 mouths than the Italian does. The subtitles really only help\nif you need them to follow the progression of the dialog. I just recommend\npaying close attention. These are movies that actually play quite well on a\ncomputer screen, by the way, and yes, they\u2019re available on Hulu Plus!\n\nSo yeah, these late Rossellini\u2019s are definitely not among the thrillingest,\nsexiest, awesomest offerings to be found in the Eclipse Series, there\u2019s no\narguing that. But they do serve as important and unique specimens of what film\ncan accomplish and preserve for the sake of a small but appreciative audience.\nMaybe even more significantly, they represent a lost utopian possibility for\nwhat one visionary director hoped the medium of television could become.\nRossellini\u2019s desire to provide solid, historically informed visualizations of\ndefining moments in our cultural heritage, without either the dumbing down or\nthe hyping up of conventional potboiler gimmicks usually deemed necessary to\nwin a mass audience, hasn\u2019t shown itself to be all that commercially viable.\nIt\u2019s even fair to conjecture that if Rossellini himself hadn\u2019t established his\nreputation so profoundly in the 1940s and 50s, films like those he made in the\nlate 60s and 70s might not even be revisited today. Still, watching The Age of\nthe Medici makes me mourn just a bit for the wasted potential of commercial\ncable TV and what an entity like the History Channel might have become, if had\nwe more directors of Rossellini\u2019s singular integrity and intelligence working\nbehind the cameras.\n\nFacebookXReddit\n\n#### David Blakeslee\n\nDavid hosts the Criterion Reflections podcast, a series that reviews the films\nof the Criterion Collection in their chronological order of release.
