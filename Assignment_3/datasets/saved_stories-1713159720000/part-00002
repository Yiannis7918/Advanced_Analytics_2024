The app, Rejoyn, is intended to supplement treatment for major\ndepressive disorder: In a clinical trial of 386 adults with major depressive\ndisorder (who were also being treated with antidepressant medication),\nparticipants who used the app saw improved depression symptoms after 6 weeks\nof treatment.\n\nUsing digital tools to improve mental health is not new, of course. There are\ntons of apps available for meditation, journaling, and even connecting to a\ntherapist\u2014and there have been apps approved by the Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA) to treat ADHD, substance use disorder, and insomnia.\n\nRejoyn is expected to be available by prescription for iOS and Android devices\nin summer 2024, but there\u2019s no information yet on how much the app will cost\nor whether insurance companies will cover it. Here\u2019s what we know so far about\nhow Rejoyn works and whether you should look into it when it\u2019s available.\n\n## What to expect from Rejoyn\n\nRejoyn uses a six-week program of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) lessons,\nexercises, and personalized reminders and messages. During the program, you\nwill complete three lessons and three exercises each week. For four weeks\nfollowing the program, you can still access the lessons for review. Lessons (a\nshort video followed by an off-app or interactive activity) take 3-4 minutes\nand exercises take 11-26 minutes each.\n\nAccording to Otsuka, the company that made Rejoyn, lessons focus on cognitive\nrestructuring (observing and re-framing maladaptive cognitions such as\ncognitive distortions), behavioral activation (deliberately increasing goal-\ndirected behavior, physical activity, and interpersonal interaction), and\nemotional regulation (an individual\u2019s ability to modulate or control the\ninfluence an emotion has on them, or to modulate the degree to which an\nemotion is experienced).\n\n## Who is Rejoyn a good match for?\n\nRejoyn is intended for people who are 22 or older and are diagnosed with\ndepression. It will be most suited to people who are tech savvy and want to\nuse digital resources to accompany talk therapy and medication for depression.\n\n\u201cIt's essential to note that while Rejoyn represents a significant milestone\nas the first prescription digital treatment for major depressive disorder, its\nefficacy and suitability for individuals may vary,\u201d said Dr. Sanam Hafeez,\nneuropsychologist and director of Comprehend the Mind. \u201cAs with any treatment,\nconsulting with a therapist is crucial to determine whether Rejoyn is an\nappropriate option and to develop a comprehensive treatment plan tailored to\nthe individual's needs.\u201d\n\n## How can you access Rejoyn?\n\nRejoyn requires a prescription, so you will have to talk to your primary care\ndoctor, psychiatrist, or psychologist about your depression symptoms and\ntreatment.\n\n\u201cDuring this consultation, the healthcare provider will conduct an evaluation\nto assess the individual's symptoms, medical history, and current treatments.\nBased on this evaluation, the provider will discuss various treatment options,\nincluding Rejoyn, alongside traditional therapies like medication and\npsychotherapy,\u201d Hafeez said. \u201cIf Rejoyn is deemed suitable for the individual,\nthe healthcare provider will issue a prescription for the app.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile it may provide tools and resources for managing symptoms, it may not\naddress the underlying causes of depression in the same way that therapy and\nmedication can,\u201d Hafeez said. However, it could be a source of support between\ntherapy sessions.\n\n## Other apps that could help with depression\n\nHafeez said there are non-prescription apps that show promise in improving\nsymptoms of depression. She shared these examples:\n\n  * Headspace offers guided mindfulness and meditation exercises aimed at reducing stress and promoting emotional well-being. \"Research has suggested that mindfulness-based interventions can be effective in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety,\" Hafeez said.\n\n  * Woebot is a chatbot-based app that delivers CBT techniques through conversational interactions. \"Research has found that Woebot can be effective in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety, particularly among younger users,\" Hafeez said.\n\n  * Happify offers activities and games designed to promote happiness and well-being by targeting negative thoughts and behaviors. \"While research on Happify specifically is limited, interventions focused on positive psychology principles have shown promise in improving mood and psychological well-being,\" Hafeez said.\n\nWhile the number of digital tools available for tending your mental health are\ngrowing, don\u2019t ditch therapy and meds yet.\n\n\u201cIt's important to note that while these apps have shown effectiveness in\nresearch studies, they are not intended to replace professional treatment for\ndepression,\u201d Hafeez said. \u201cIndividuals experiencing depression should consult\nwith a healthcare provider to determine the most appropriate treatment options\nfor their needs. Additionally, ongoing research is needed to further evaluate\nthe efficacy and long-term effects of digital interventions for depression.\u201d\n\nLatest\n\nSee More\n\nWordle\n\nToday\u2019s Wordle Hints (and Answer) for Sunday, April 14, 2024\n\nApril 14, 2024\n\nConnections\n\nToday's NYT Connections Hints (and Answer) for Sunday, April 14, 2024\n\nApril 14, 2024\n\nFitness\n\nThe Best Exercises for a Stronger Upper Back\n\nApril 13, 2024\n\nAnna Lee Beyer\n\nAnna Lee Beyer writes about mental health, relationships, parenting, and books\nfor Huffington Post, Romper, Slate, Glamour, Parents, and others.\n\nRead Anna's full bio\n\nMore by Anna\n\nPlants\n\nThe Best Ways to Identify Any Wildflower You See\n\nApril 9, 2024\n\nBody\n\nHow to Stop Beating Yourself Up About Your Body Image\n\nMarch 11, 2024\n\nRelated Articles\n\nApril 11, 2024\n\nHow Long Can You Actually Go Without Sleep?\n\nApril 10, 2024\n\nEverything You Should Bring With You on a Run (and How to Carry It)\n\nApril 10, 2024\n\nHow to Add Up the Weights When You're Lifting With a Barbell\n\nApril 10, 2024\n\nWhat Is Zone 2 Cardio, and How Do I Actually Do It?\n\nLifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.\nOur mission is to offer reliable tech help and credible, practical, science-\nbased life advice to help you live better.\n\n  * Our Mission\n  * Our Team\n  * Newsletter\n\n  * Latest\n  * Tech\n  * Food\n  * Entertainment\n  * Health\n  * Money\n  * Home & Garden\n  * Relationships\n  * Deals\n  * Hacks\n  * #What to Watch This Weekend\n\n  * About Ziff Davis (Opens in a new tab)\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Advertise\n  * Accessibility\n  * Sitemap\n  * Do Not Sell My Personal Information\n\n\u00a9 2001-2024 Ziff Davis, LLC., A ZIFF DAVIS COMPANY.
