At least, that has been the conventional view.\n\nThe principle that everything looks the same everywhere is a fundamental\npillar of the standard model of cosmology, which aims to explain the big bang\nand how the universe has evolved in the 13.7bn years since.\n\nBut this week a meeting of some of the world\u2019s leading cosmologists will\nconvene at London\u2019s Royal Society to ask the question: what if this basic\nassumption is wrong?\n\nThe meeting comes after a number of high-profile astronomical observations\nhave challenged the conventional view, according to Prof Subir Sarkar, a\ncosmologist at the University of Oxford and co-organiser of the meeting.\n\n\u201cWe are, in cosmology, using a model that was first formulated in 1922,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cWe have great data, but the theoretical basis is past its sell-by date.\nMore and more people are saying the same thing and these are respected\nastronomers.\u201d\n\nThe conference brings together some of the scientists behind the recent\nanomalous findings. These include observations that suggest the universe is\nexpanding more quickly in some regions than others, hints at megastructures in\nthe night sky and evidence for cosmic flows \u2013 vast celestial rivers of\nmaterial on a scale that cannot be readily accommodated within conventional\ntheories.\n\nDr Nathan Secrest, of the US Naval Observatory and a collaborator with Sarkar,\nis presenting findings that raise the possibility that the universe is\nslightly lopsided. After analysing a catalogue of more than 1m quasars\n(extremely luminous galactic cores), the team found that one hemisphere of the\nsky appeared to host roughly 0.5% more sources than the other.\n\nIt may not sound like a major discrepancy but, according to Sarkar, if\nconfirmed it would undermine the basis for dark energy, which is supposed to\nbe the dominant component of the universe. \u201cIt would mean that two-thirds of\nthe universe has just disappeared,\u201d Sarkar said.\n\nDr Konstantinos Migkas, of Leiden University, will share findings that the\nHubble constant \u2013 the rate at which the universe is expanding \u2013 appears to\nvary across space. \u201cOur results add another problematic piece to the puzzle,\u201d\nMigkas said. At a local scale, at least, this suggests that observations do\nnot match predictions of the standard model. \u201cWe can\u2019t extrapolate that it\u2019s\nwrong over the full universe,\u201d he added.\n\nAlexia Lopez, a PhD student at the University of Central Lancashire, has\ndiscovered what appear to be cosmic megastructures, named Big Ring and Giant\nArc. These shapes, traced out by galaxies and galaxy clusters, occur on a\nscale beyond which the universe should be smooth and effectively featureless.\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re finding a list of structures that are exceeding this scale, are\nthey challenging this assumption that is so fundamental in cosmology?\u201d said\nLopez. \u201cMaybe there needs to be more of a critical analysis of our standard\nmodel.\u201d\n\nSarkar suggests that belief in the standard model of cosmology has been so\ndeeply ingrained that it is treated as \u201cthe religion\u201d. \u201cI find that frankly\nannoying that this principle hasn\u2019t been checked,\u201d he said, although not\neveryone agrees with this characterisation.\n\nProf George Efstathiou, an astrophysicist at the University of Cambridge, who\nis presenting a more sceptical take at the conference, said it was not true\nthat the model had not been repeatedly interrogated. \u201cPeople accuse me of\ndefending the model,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what they don\u2019t realise is how much time\nI\u2019ve spent trying to disprove it. I completely disagree that\u2019s there\u2019s some\nkind of groupthink.\u201d\n\nEfstathiou said that while intriguing, none of the anomalies being presented\nwere compelling enough to undermine standard theories. \u201cThe question is: how\ngood are the data?\u201d he said. The claimed lopsidedness of the universe, for\ninstance, could be due to the necessary use of multiple telescopes to observe\ndifferent hemispheres of the sky, so that sifting through data to look for\npatterns would inevitably throw up what appeared to be anomalies, he\nsuggested. \u201cThe Big Circle in the sky, I definitely don\u2019t believe in,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\nProf Wendy Freeman, who is presenting new findings from the James Webb space\ntelescope, said: \u201cHere are all these tantalising threads at varying levels of\nsignificance. We need more exploration on where, if at all, the standard model\nbreaks down. I don\u2019t think there is an obvious thing that is going to stand\nthe test of time.\u201d\n\nThis kind of robust debate is welcome at the conference. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward\nto a vigorous discussion,\u201d said Sarkar. \u201cLet them come at it with everything\nthey\u2019ve got.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Space\n  * Astronomy\n  * Physics\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * UK\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Ukraine\n  * Environment\n  * Science\n  * Global development\n  * Football\n  * Tech\n  * Business\n  * Obituaries\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
