How to provide customers with reliable and stable express\n> tracking has become one of the important issues that express companies need\n> to solve now. The current stage of courier tracking is not ideal in\n> challenging environments such as mountain roads, tunnels and city centres.\n> Therefore, the project aims to overcome the challenging environment and\n> achieve stable express tracking, and proposes the Ya'an scenario and\n> conducted multiple experiments. We show that opportunistic DTN-aware\n> protocols are feasible solution for trucks to maintain stable communication\n> in challenging environments, and nodes maintain extremely high message\n> delivery rates and average delays that can maintain communication.\n\nSubjects:| Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.03033 [cs.NI]  \n(or arXiv:2404.03033v1 [cs.NI] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.03033arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Milena Radenkovic [view email] [v1] Wed, 3 Apr 2024 19:37:53 UTC (1,235\nKB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Autonomous Vehicle Networks for More Reliable\nTruck Tracking in Challenged High Mountain Roads, Tunnels and Bridges\nEnvironments, by Junhao Chen and 1 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.NI\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
