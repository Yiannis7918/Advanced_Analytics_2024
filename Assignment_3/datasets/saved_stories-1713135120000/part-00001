Its failure\nwould represent a remarkable victory for advocates\u2014and a potential beginning\nof the end for the industry as we know it.\n\nPhoto: Rodnae Productions | Pexels\n\nDana Floberg, Morgan DuckettApr 04, 2024\n\nLast week, the nation\u2019s largest prison and jail telecom corporation, Securus,\neffectively defaulted on more than a billion dollars of debt. After decades of\npreying on incarcerated people and their loved ones with exploitative call\nrates and other predatory practices that have driven millions of families into\ndebt, Securus is being crushed under the weight of its own. In March, the\ncompany\u2019s creditors gave the corporation an eight-month extension to pay up,\nurging its sale to a new owner to stave off an otherwise imminent bankruptcy.\n\nSecurus is one of two corporations that dominate roughly 80 percent of the\nU.S. prison telecom industry, forming an effective duopoly that thrives on the\ncaptive markets found inside the nation\u2019s lockups. Both companies are owned by\nprivate-equity firms: Securus, by Platinum Equity, and ViaPath (previously\nGlobal Tel Link), by American Securities.\n\nThe slow death of the largest player in this space is not accidental. It\nfollows six years of intense advocacy to expose the vulnerability of the\nprison telecom industry\u2019s business model on both ethical and economic grounds.\nOrganizers have waged a strategic war against Securus, educating investors and\nthe public about the company\u2019s predatory practices while successfully\nadvocating for legislation and regulation to rein them in.\n\nWith Platinum now on the hook to pay $1.3 billion of Securus debt this year\nfollowing a series of failed attempts to refinance, bankruptcy seems\ninevitable. The company\u2019s failure would represent a remarkable victory for\nadvocates\u2014and a potential beginning of the end for the prison telecom industry\nas we know it.\n\n### A Predatory Business Model\n\nTogether, Securus and ViaPath contract with 43 state prison systems and over\n800 county jails. Their dominance of the market allows them to routinely\ncharge incarcerated people and their families egregious rates for rudimentary\ncommunications services: A 15-minute phone call can run as high as $8.25; a\n25-minute video call up to $15; and basic emails as much as $0.50, or more\nwith attachments. On top of this, telecom companies are raking in new revenue\nwith digital tablets that offer media, including movies, songs, and games, at\nprices far above market rate.\n\nThe nature of agreements between these telecom providers and correctional\nagencies often further incentivizes the financial exploitation of the\nincarcerated, creating profit-sharing kickback schemes that provide prisons\nand jails with a portion of sales revenue. As a result, many agencies award\ncontracts to the vendor with the highest commission, which often translates to\nthe highest prices.\n\nFacing extreme costs and abysmal or nonexistent wages, incarcerated people\nmust often turn to their families to help pay for communication services.\nFamilies routinely face an impossible choice between accepting a call from a\nloved one inside and paying their bills. Many fall into debt due to these\ncosts, and some are forced to cut contact entirely. The collapse of these\nbonds harms incarcerated people, their families and children, and society as a\nwhole, with research consistently showing that family contact is critical for\nsuccessful reentry upon release.\n\nFor years, corporations like Securus and ViaPath faced little scrutiny as they\nused this model to generate billions of dollars in revenue. More recently,\nhowever, these predatory practices have proven less viable. Despite raking in\nroughly $700 million in revenues annually, Securus has been in the red for the\nlast few years due in part to huge interest payments on debt taken out by\nPlatinum Equity upon acquiring the corporation, as well as management fees it\nmust pay the firm. ViaPath is facing a similar strain under massive debts that\nwill begin coming due in 2025.\n\n## The Appeal in Your Inbox\n\nSubscribe to our newsletters for regular updates, analysis and context\nstraight to your email.\n\n### Interrupting Business as Usual\n\nSecurus was initially formed in 2004 after the merger of two smaller\ncorrectional telecom corporations. The company changed private equity hands\nseveral times before Platinum Equity acquired it in 2017. Platinum took out\nover a billion dollars in debt to put in the winning bid for Securus\u2014a model\nthat is typical for private equity buyouts. Today, Securus has racked up a\ntotal of $1.6 billion in debt. While the private equity structure shields\nSecurus from the scrutiny applied to publicly traded corporations, this debt\nis publicly traded and provides insight into its financial health.\n\nDebt is priced relative to dollar, or par. Debt priced at 100 cents or more\nsuggests lenders are confident that the corporation is doing well, can make\ninterest payments, and will repay every dollar it borrowed. Anything lower\nindicates the opposite. During the first two years of Platinum Equity\u2019s\nownership, Securus\u2019 debt value was steady at par.\n\nA Flourish chart\n\nThings started to change in 2018 when a coalition led by the New York-based\nadvocacy organization Worth Rises passed first-of-its-kind legislation in New\nYork City to make jail calls free. In 2020, local advocates did the same in\nSan Francisco. In 2021, Connecticut became the first state to pass legislation\nmaking prison and jail communication free. These early victories sent a\npowerful message to the industry: the exploitative status quo upon which\nSecurus\u2019 profits depended was beginning to crumble.\n\nWhile advocates continued to organize, the industry was still largely\npreoccupied with pursuing a strategy of growth through acquisition. In 2018,\nSecurus sought to acquire ICSolutions, the third-largest player in the prison\ntelecom market. But Worth Rises and national partners contested the deal,\narguing to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that the merger would\nharm incarcerated people by reducing competition. If approved, the merger\nwould have further consolidated the industry, putting roughly 90 percent of\nthe market under Securus and ViaPath\u2019s control. The FCC agreed in April 2019,\nleading Securus and ICSolutions to abandon the deal.\n\nThe next step for advocates was to convince major investors to ditch Platinum\nEquity over its ties to Securus. In meetings over the next six months, they\nexplained that Platinum\u2019s investment in the prison telecom giant presented\nsubstantial reputational and financial risks, especially as policymakers and\nregulators turned their attention to the industry. The strategy paid off. In\nSeptember, the Pennsylvania State Employees\u2019 Retirement System denied Platinum\nEquity a $150 million investment, citing the extensive negative press\nsurrounding Securus.\n\nIn the wake of this campaign, Securus\u2019 debt dropped to distressed levels as\nlow as 47 cents on the dollar. The corporation still had its contracts and\nenough cash flow to stay in business, but investors were showing little\nconfidence that it would survive long enough to pay back its debts.\n\n### No Easy Exits\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic rescued Securus, at least temporarily. With prisons and\njails across the country locking down and banning visits, skyrocketing call\nvolume and expanded digital tablet programs provided new fuel to the industry.\nWhile families struggled to stay healthy, financially afloat, and connected,\nSecurus notched a 10 percent increase in revenue year-over-year from 2019 to\n2020, significantly higher than the year before. Its debt pricing reflected\nthis grim success, bouncing back to more than 90 cents on the dollar.\n\nAdvocates refused to back down, this time targeting Platinum Equity founder\nand CEO Tom Gores. In the fall of 2020, Worth Rises and the racial justice\norganization Color of Change called for his removal from the prestigious,\nmostly-billionaire board of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art over his ties\nto Securus. Hundreds of artists, curators, and collectors joined the campaign,\nand in less than a month, Gores was forced to resign. Two months later, Worth\nRises took out a full-page ad in the sports section of the New York Times\ncalling on the NBA to force Gores to sell the Detroit Pistons.\n\nPlatinum Equity and Gores were desperate to offload Securus and saw the\ncompany\u2019s pandemic-boosted financials as an opportunity to do so profitably.\nThey planned to sell Securus to a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC),\na public shell corporation formed solely to acquire and take a private\ncorporation public without the scrutiny of an initial public offering.\n\nWith broad mandates, SPAC investors pony up millions without knowing much\nabout what they\u2019re buying. Advocates quickly moved to change that, informing\nthe SPAC\u2019s management and investors that the sale would make them the not-so-\nproud shareholders of an ethically bankrupt and financially unstable prison\nprofiteer. In late 2022, the deal failed, forcing Platinum back to the drawing\nboard.\n\n\u201cAfter endlessly pillaging impacted communities, we did not want Platinum to\nwalk out the winner,\u201d said Bianca Tylek, the executive director at Worth\nRises. \u201cThey refused real change for years, so now, we weren\u2019t going to allow\nthem any easy exits.\u201d\n\nThe deal\u2019s collapse came as expiring prison restrictions and successful prison\ntelecom regulations began to cut into the industry\u2019s pandemic windfalls. In\nSeptember 2022, California passed a bill to make calls free in state prisons.\nBy the fall of 2023, Colorado and Minnesota had also mandated free phone calls\nfor people in prison, and Massachusetts had become the first state to make all\nprison communication free in both prisons and local jails.\n\nAround the same time, a decades-long fight in Congress finally led to the\npassage of the Martha Wright-Reed Just and Reasonable Communications Act. The\nlegislation\u2014named after Martha Wright-Reed, who first filed an FCC petition to\nreduce the price of prison calls so that she could stay in touch with her\nincarcerated grandson\u2014secured the FCC\u2019s authority to regulate rates for in-\nstate calls from correctional facilities, which make up 80% of all prison and\njail calls, and granted it regulatory authority over video calls for the first\ntime.\n\nThe enactment of that legislation sent Securus\u2019 debt prices tumbling once\nmore.\n\n### The Looming Debt Wall\n\nWith its debt prices sinking, Securus faced newfound urgency: $1.3 billion in\ndebt was set to come due in 2024. Hundreds of millions more would follow in\n2025. In May 2023, Platinum Equity announced a plan to go to the public debt\nmarket to refinance Securus\u2019 debt with new bonds. As a show of confidence for\ninvestors, Platinum promised to inject another $400 million of equity into\nSecurus.\n\nThe corporation\u2019s debt value improved after the announcement, but investor\nexcitement fizzled after Securus failed to secure a refinancing deal even with\nthe sweetener. Banks and lenders, it turned out, were not eager to jump on a\ntoxic prison industry asset that had become the focus of so much negative\nattention and pressure.\n\nWith the clock ticking on Securus\u2019 debt, Worth Rises reached out to credit\nrating agencies to share information about the state of the prison telecom\nindustry, including the legislative, regulatory, and contract pressures it\nincreasingly faced. In October, S&P Global downgraded Aventiv, Securus\u2019 parent\ncompany, to a CCC- credit rating with a negative outlook\u2014a highly speculative,\njunk bond grade. Analysts explained that the growth of legislation making jail\nand prison calls free threatened the corporation\u2019s model because \u201cprofits\ncould shrink if [Securus] is forced to negotiate with entities that have more\nnegotiating leverage.\u201d\n\nIn November, credit rating agency Moody\u2019s followed suit, downgrading Aventiv\nto \u201cjunk\u201d status. Analysts noted that neither the corporation\u2019s cost-savings\nefforts\u2014including the firing of nearly 300 employees\u2014nor its revenue expansion\nefforts had meaningfully changed this outlook.\n\nWith less than a year before the first tranche of loans came due, Securus made\na last-ditch effort to avoid bankruptcy. The corporation coerced its creditors\ninto a distressed debt exchange to delay its maturity dates and interest\npayments. The distressed deal gave Securus some immediate relief from its debt\nobligations but cost Platinum Equity $20 million and sparked last week\u2019s\ncredit ratings downgrade to default. Today, the company\u2019s debt is trading as\nlow as 8 cents on the dollar.\n\n### What Comes Next\n\nAs financial institutions have soured on Securus, their reasoning has\nreaffirmed an argument advocates have been making for years.\n\nThe success of the prison telecom industry depends entirely on investors, who\nonly recently began to question the ethics of the business, and government\ncomplicity from local jails all the way up to Congress. When correctional\nagencies\u2014rather than incarcerated people and their families\u2014are required to\ncover costs associated with these services, this predatory scheme collapses,\nas states finally have an incentive to demand lower prices from their prison\ntelecom vendors.\n\nAnd telecom services don\u2019t need to be made entirely free to destabilize the\nindustry\u2019s business model. Any movement to lower exorbitant rates can threaten\nthe bottom line of corporations that have built an empire around price-gouging\nthe incarcerated. In the wake of recent reforms, phone revenues have declined\nsharply, while sales of new products like digital tablets have not made up the\ndifference.\n\nAll of this spells bad news for cash-strapped Securus and similarly debt-\nburdened ViaPath. For years, ViaPath\u2019s owner, American Securities, has\nfollowed the same playbook as Platinum Equity, including trying and failing to\noffload ViaPath in a SPAC deal. When it comes time to refinance the company\u2019s\ndebt next year, investors will be even less likely to take a risk on ViaPath\nif Securus fails to repay its debts later this year.\n\nWhile much remains uncertain about how Securus or other prison telecom\nproviders will manage the hard road ahead, the destabilization of this\nindustry could have implications for the hundreds of thousands of incarcerated\npeople who are currently forced to rely on these companies to communicate with\nthe outside world.\n\nAdvocates note that even if a major provider like Securus were to declare\nbankruptcy, this would not necessarily lead to a disruption in prison telecom\nservices. Bankruptcy alone would not fully put these corporations out of\nbusiness, at least not immediately.\n\nInstead, they hope Securus\u2019 downfall would spur a broader reckoning that\nright-sizes the industry, stopping the growth of prison telecom corporations,\nreducing their profit margins, and driving private equity and other financiers\nout. Even modest changes could break the industry\u2019s current stranglehold on\nprisons and jails, opening the field up to creative new solutions like in-\nhouse telecom services or nonprofit providers that can offer the same service\nat a fraction of the cost. All of this bodes well for future efforts to make\nprison and jail communication free nationwide.\n\nThrough a yearslong campaign of strategic actions, Worth Rises and its\npartners have brought the largest correctional telecom operator to the brink\nof insolvency while exposing the industry\u2019s underlying vulnerability. Many of\nthe corporations that have profited off this predatory business model are\nprivate equity-owned, debt-laden, and facing serious financial challenges.\nAdvocates argue that the same tactics that brought Securus down\u2014narrative\nchange, policy campaigns, regulatory efforts, and investor activism\u2014offer a\nroadmap for tackling exploitative corporate profiteers across the prison\nindustry.\n\nAfter decades of exerting nearly unfettered power and influence over carceral\npolicies and practices, the prison industry racket could finally be coming to\nan end.\n\n\u201cPowerful prison profiteers are upholding mass incarceration so they can take\nhome billions every year, but they are not unstoppable,\u201d said Tylek of Worth\nRises. \u201cThis is a warning to all those with no scruples about how they make\ntheir money: hands off our communities.\u201d\n\nDana Floberg is the director of corporate campaigns at Worth Rises, where they\nlead strategic efforts to end corporate exploitation of incarcerated people\nacross prison industry sectors.
