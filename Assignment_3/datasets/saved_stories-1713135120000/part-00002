Kaspars Grinvalds -\nstock.adobe.com\n\nIt\u2019s a big problem \u2014 and it\u2019s growing even bigger.\n\nSocial media users are being bombarded with advertisements for easy access to\nerectile dysfunction drugs like Viagra and Cialis, along with affordable\ngenerics \u2014 and men hoping to improve their sexual performance are taking their\nchances.\n\nThat\u2019s a hard no, Cleveland Clinic urologist Raevti Bole, MD warns.\n\nJust because these medications are easier than ever to access doesn\u2019t mean you\nshould fall for the hype.\n\nRecreational use of the drugs can carry significant risks, the pro warns.\n\nHere\u2019s why.\n\n## Explore More\n\n### Dear Abby: My parents expect me to take off work to babysit while they're\non vacation\n\n### Flight attendant reveals her tactic to get passengers to swap seats so\nfamilies can sit together\n\n### My sex addiction took over my life and nearly drove me to suicide: 'I hurt\npeople'\n\nViagra, Cialis and their generic equivalents are what are known as\nphosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors.\n\nThey open up your blood vessels and can be used in a variety of ways,\nincluding the treatment of pulmonary hypertension, or urinary problems.\n\nThese days, they\u2019re most famous for being so-called magic cures for erectile\ndysfunction, or ED. Popping a pill leads to increased blood flow, which means\nbetter erections that last longer.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where the problem comes in, according to Dr. Bole \u2014 if you can get\nan erection at all, one that\u2019s good enough to allow penetration, you most\nlikely don\u2019t have ED, and you probably don\u2019t need drugs.\n\nReal problems with erectile dysfunction could be masking other health issues \u2014\nanother reason to consult your provider before popping a pill. Elnur \u2013\nstock.adobe.com\n\nNot that that\u2019s stopping men from popping unnecessary, and sometimes expensive\npills.\n\nReasons why, according to the doc, include compensating for alcohol or drug\nuse, allowing for longer sessions, or multiple sessions, and boosting\nconfidence.\n\nAnd some men are even using the drugs for non-sex purposes \u2014 like improving\ntheir stamina in the gym.\n\nTo all of the above, the pros say a big nope \u2014 with one surprising caveat.\n\nSome men are even using the drugs for non-sex purposes \u2014 like improving their\nstamina in the gym. Getty Images\n\n\u201cPDE5 medications can increase oxygen levels and heart function in people who\nhave cardiac risk factors or cardiac disease,\u201d says Dr. Bole. \u201cFor people who\nare healthy, there\u2019s no good evidence that the medications significantly\nimprove athletic abilities in a standard, sea-level environment.\u201d\n\nMentioning the altitude is no accident \u2014 that\u2019s because research has shown\nthat taking sildenafil, which is marketed as Viagra, can improve performance\nat high altitudes, like on Mt. Everest.\n\nFor most of us, however, that\u2019s not an issue.\n\n## Here are the risks of recreational Viagra and Cialis use\n\n### 1\\. If you\u2019re taking other drugs, there could be dangerous interactions\n\nBecause PDE5 inhibitors lower your blood pressure, mixing them with other\ndrugs that do the same thing could be life-thretening, Dr. Bole warns.\n\nEven if you go through another source to secure the medication, talk to your\ndoctor about it first \u2014 and make sure to talk to them about supplements and\nother recreational drugs you might be using.\n\nCommon double-ups that people might not know are dangerous include amyl\nnitrate, used frequently during sex and known better as \u201cpoppers,\u201d\nnitroglycerine, used for chest pain and heart-related issues, and certain\nblood pressure medications.\n\n### 2\\. Side effects are common when taking ED drugs\n\nWhile these are normally mild, they can be annoying \u2014 or worrying, if you\ndon\u2019t know what to expect.\n\nFor example, many users will get headaches \u2014 and they won\u2019t always be mild.\nThere\u2019s also acid reflux, facial flushing, muscle aces, stuffy nose and\nchanges in vision to watch out for.\n\nAlso be aware of the risk of what\u2019s known as priapism \u2014 an erection that won\u2019t\ngo away for hours, which can be quite painful.\n\n\u201cLuckily, it is quite rare when using oral ED medications,\u201d Dr. Bole said.\n\u201cBut if this happens to you, seek emergency medical care immediately.\u201d\n\n### 3\\. You can become psychologically dependent on a drug you don\u2019t need\n\nOne risk of using Viagra or Cialis to boost your confidence is that you might\nbegin to worry about having sex without popping a pill.\n\n\u201cIf you are having severe performance anxiety that\u2019s affecting your erections,\nI recommend talking to your healthcare provider or a sex therapist,\u201d said Dr.\nBole.\n\n\u201cA medical professional can discuss your worries about sex; help you set\npersonalized and realistic expectations; and develop strategies to improve\nyour confidence without relying on medication alone.\u201d\n\n### 4\\. You cannot trust many of the suppliers\n\nFrom quick telehealth appointments geared to getting you a prescription you\nthen fill directly with the supplier to online sellers and even gas station\ncounters, drugs and supplements are everywhere these days.\n\nBut do you know who you\u2019re buying from? The FDA warns against some common, so-\ncalled dietary supplements that may contain PDE5 inhibitors, found as close by\nas your corner bodega. Skip it, warns the agency.\n\n## 5\\. Association with high-risk behaviors\n\nAnother thing you shouldn\u2019t mix Viagra and Cialis use with? Alcohol or drugs.\nOne reason is, you could find yourself less inhibited, and more likely to\nindulge in behaviors that could leave you with a sexually transmitted\ninfection, or an STI.\n\n\u201cUsing ED medications to enhance your sexual performance when you\u2019re under the\ninfluence of alcohol or drugs can lead you to make choices that harm your\nsexual and overall health,\u201d Dr. Bole stressed.\n\n## Talk to your doctor before using Viagra or Cialis\n\nWhether you really need it or just want to use it recreationally, you should\nbe in contact with your healthcare professional first.\n\nWhat do you think? Post a comment.\n\nAnd there\u2019s one really good reason why, beyond safety \u2014 decline in erectile\nfunction could be masking a much larger health problem, like diabetes, heart\nand blood pressure issues, or even low testosterone, the experts say.\n\n\u201cSome patients may feel reluctant or embarrassed to talk about their sex\nlife,\u201d said Dr. Bole. \u201cBut we have these conversations all the time with\npatients. You are not alone. Our role is to help you understand the risks\nversus benefits and provide guidance without judgment.\u201d\n\n### Share this article:\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Flipboard\n  * WhatsApp\n  * Email\n  * Copy\n\nFiled under\n\n  * Erectile Dysfunction\n  * viagra\n  * 4/13/24\n\nRead Next Doctor reveals what a 'slice of penis' looks like under a ...\n\n#### Top Concerts\n\nVividseats: Official Ticketing Partner of New York Post Get seats.
