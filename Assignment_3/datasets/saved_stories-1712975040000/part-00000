Old\nideas that have dominated elite political thought, whether capitalism or\nliberalism or progressive social democracy or whatever else, are rapidly\nlosing popularity. The capitalists are supporting tariffs. The libertarians\nare pushing to ban lab-grown meat, and are actively railing against the few in\ntheir ranks who still remember that libertarianism is supposed to be about\nliberty. The \"new authoritarians\" of the world, meanwhile, are hardly\npresenting an attractive alternative.\n\nSome are trying to respond to this crisis by reminding us of the virtues of\nthe old ideals of civility and decorum, hoping that we could wind back the\nclock and return to them. My friend Dennis Pourteaux is a good example of this\nkind of mentality:\n\nThe problem is that this is a fundamentally reactionary mentality, and it\nfails for the exact same reasons why all other reactionary mentalities fail.\nIf before we were at political equilibrium A, and today we are at political\nequilibrium B, then that alone is strong evidence that A is unstable, and even\nif you somehow force a transition back to A, the likely outcome is that we'll\ncome right back to B again.\n\nAs much as defenders of the ancien regime might wish otherwise, pre-internet\nold guard elite notions of respectability and decorum are simply fundamentally\nincompatible with the world as it stands in the 2020s. And so instead of\ntrying to look backward, we need to look forward. So what is the forward-\nlooking ideology that solves these problems? Degen communism.\n\n## What is degen communism?\n\nWhat does the internet of the 2020s - not the \"respectable\" internet of\nSubstack, not a hypothetical version of Twitter where the bad people and\nsomehow only the bad people are censored, but the real internet as it exists\ntoday - fundamentally want? The answer is, it wants chaos. It does not want\ngentle debates between professionals who \"disagree on policy but agree on\ncivics\". It wants decisive action and risk, in all its glory. Not a world with\ngenteel respect for principles, where even the loser peacefully accepts defeat\nbecause they understand that even if they lose one day they may still win the\nnext, but a world with great warriors who are willing to bet their entire life\nsavings and reputation on one single move that reflects their deepest\nconviction on what things need to be done. And it wants a world where the\nbrave have the freedom to take such risks.\n\nAt the same time, the general welfare of humanity demands a greater focus on\nthe common good. We've seen too many instances of epic collapses, orchestrated\nby failed machinations of the elites, where the common people end up screwed\nbut the elites remain immune or even benefit. The 2008 financial crisis was\nitself an example of this. Rapid advances in technology, and rapid openings in\nimmigration and trade, leave most people better off, but often leave jobless\nthose who are not in a good position to adjust. Rapidly growing tech\ncompanies\" disrupt\" old extractive elites, but then quickly become extractive\nelites themselves. But most proponents of the common good associate the common\ngood with extreme notions of \"social stability\", which are often an excuse for\nkeeping old extractive elites entrenched, and in any case are lame and\nincompatible with the trends of the 21st century. Like the occasional forest\nfire and its positive effects on antifragility of natural ecosystems, chaos is\nthe mother of revitalization and renewal.\n\nThis brings me to the core idea of degen communism: a political ideology that\nopenly embraces chaos, but tweaks key rules and incentives to create a\nbackground pressure where the consequences of chaos are aligned with the\ncommon good.\n\nDegen communist ideas can be adopted by any type of entity with a network\neffect: crypto projects, social media sites, virtual game environments and\ngovernments. Many of the core ideas are common across all of these categories.\n\n## Cryptocurrency: the avant garde in degen. Can it become degen communist?\n\nThe world of cryptocurrencies is one of the sectors of society that embraces\nthe \"degen\" the most. It has ups and downs that are unseen in almost any other\nmarket. Meanwhile, the actual effects of the downs are often smaller than they\nseem, which is why the space has not collapsed completely. A 90% price drop\nerases billions of dollars of value, but the average dollar lost is only lost\nin mark-to-market book-value terms: it's people to held on the way up, and\nkept holding on the way down. The average coin lost from a $100 million defi\nhack is a coin that was worth ten times less two years earlier. Sometimes, the\nunpredictable chaos also does good: many memecoins have donated significant\namounts to charity.\n\nBut even still, when the prices crash, especially due to sudden failures of\nprojects that promised their users stability, too many people get hurt. Could\nwe create a world where the chaos remains, but the human harm that comes from\nthe downfalls is 10x smaller? Here, I will resurrect an idea that I supported\nduring the Terra/Luna collapse of 2022:\n\nWhen projects collapse or get hacked, and only partial refunds are possible,\ndon't make the refunds proportional. Instead, make smaller users whole first,\nup to some threshold (eg. $50k). Two years ago, when I proposed this idea,\nmany treated it with scorn, misrepresenting the idea as asking for government\nbailouts. Today, nobody seems to care about principles anymore, and so even\nversions of this idea that are government-backed can perhaps more easily get\nadopted. Here, though, I am not proposing anything to do with governments;\nrather, I am proposing that project teams put into their terms of service an\nexpectation that in the event of project insolvency, partial refunds will be\nprioritized in this way. The only request to governments is that appropriate\nrules get passed so that bankruptcy courts acknowledge the legitimacy of such\narrangements.\n\nThis mitigates the downsides of chaos toward the most vulnerable. Now, what\nabout better capturing the upsides of chaos? Here, I support a combination of\nsteps:\n\n  * Memecoins and games can donate a portion of their issuance to charity.\n  * Projects can use airdrops that try their best to distribute the most to individual users, as well as public good contributors such as open source software developers, solo stakers, etc. The Starknet airdrop was an excellent demonstration of this, as were other egalitarian airdrops like the ENS airdrop.\n  * Projects can have public goods funding programs (whether proactive or retroactive). The first three rounds of optimism retro funding were an excellent example; more projects should replicate this model.\n  * If a governance token gets too concentrated, and the concentrated players make bad decisions, the community should be more willing to fork the project and zero out the tokens of the concentrated players who made the bad decisions. This was done most successfully in the Hive fork of Steem.\n\nMany of these ideas, especially those that depend on some notion of \"per-\nperson\", would have been very difficult to reliably administer in 2019. In\n2024, however, we have more and more robust proof of personhood protocols,\nproofs of community participation such as POAPs, and reusable lists such as\nStarkware's list of solo stakers that they used for their airdrop. Hence, a\ndegen communist future for crypto is very possible.\n\nThe solution is to merge the two together. Keep the base instinct, especially\nthe base instinct of enjoying watching things blow up, but tilt it toward the\ncommon good. In exchange, the base instinct people can enjoy greater\nlegitimacy.\n\nIncidentally, maybe this is why that L2 is called \"Base\".\n\n## What might degen communism look like in government policy?\n\nThe two main forms of chaos in the broader world are social media and markets.\nRather than trying to defang both, we should embrace both (especially\nmarkets), and try to tilt them toward more often serving the common good.\nPolitics is inherently a more slow-moving domain, so the proposals will seem\n10x milder. However, the increased scale of their impact more than makes up\nfor it.\n\n### Land value taxes and YIMBY\n\nToday, real estate markets in many parts of the developed world are in crisis.\nIn the most expensive regions, wealthy landowners earn millions by simply\nholding on to pieces of real estate that they acquired at dirt-cheap prices\nmore than half a century ago. Rules like California's Proposition 13 mean that\nthey only have to pay property taxes calculated as though their plot still had\na much lower price. At the same time, many of these same people push to\nmaintain restrictive regulations that prevent more dense housing from being\nbuilt. This is a society that favors the rich. Traditional leftists' favorite\ncountermeasure, rent control rules, only benefit people who stay in the same\nplace for many years, at the expense of very long waits for new people who\nwant to come in. Meanwhile, governments' ability to raise revenue to fund\npublic services is limited by the fact that if income and sales taxes are\npushed too high, people simply go somewhere else.\n\nThis status quo is the exact opposite of degen, and the opposite of communist.\nAnd so a degen communist will seek to overturn all parts of it. Instead of\nfocusing on taxing income and business, which can flee a state or country that\ntaxes it too heavily, we would put the primary tax burden on land, which\ncannot. Land value taxes, a yearly property tax proportional on the value of\nland (but not the buildings on the land), have been broadly supported by many\neconomists for over a century. We can add per-person exemptions, limiting the\neffects of the tax on the most vulnerable: if we send half the entire revenue\nfrom a land value tax directly into a per-person dividend, then anyone who\nowns less than half the average amount of land (ie. almost all poor people)\nwould net-benefit!\n\nThis could be viewed as a market-based tax plus a dividend, or it can be\nviewed as a rationing scheme, where if you own less land than your quota you\ncan get a reward by renting your excess quota to people who own more.\n\nA degen communist would also repeal restrictive rules that heavily limit what\ncan be built on the land, allowing much more construction to take place. There\nare already places in the world that follow something close to this approach:\nmuch of East Asia and, surprisingly, Austin, Texas.\n\nAustin skyline, 2014 vs 2023.\n\nHousing supply growth in Austin is fast, and rents are dropping. Texas does\nnot have a land value tax, but it has high property taxes: 1.77% per year,\ncompared to 0.7% per year in much of California. Texas taxes its rich - but it\ntaxes their land, not their income. And it taxes stasis, rather than dynamism,\nand in doing so it makes itself more affordable to the poor.\n\nMany today are suffering from high prices - so let's drop the prices we can\ndrop (most notably, rent) with a few simple policy changes.\n\n### Harberger taxes on intellectual property\n\nSo-called \"intellectual property\" (ie. copyrights and patents) is one of the\nmost elite-controlled forms of \"property\" around, and one of the forms of\ngovernment regulation most harmful to dynamism. On the other hand, many are\nconcerned that removing intellectual property entirely would overly harm the\nincentive to innovate and make artistic works. To strike a balance, I propose\na happy medium: we keep copyrights and patents, but put Harberger taxes on\nthem.\n\nThis would work as follows. For a copyright or patent to be valid, whoever\nowns it must publicly register a value, which we will call that copyright or\npatent's \"exclusivity price\". They must then pay 2% of the exclusivity price\nannually in tax (they can change the exclusivity price at any time). Anyone\ncan pay the owner the exclusivity price, and get an unlimited right to also\nuse (and if they wish sub-license, including to the entire world) that\ncopyright or patent. The original owner would retain the right to use in all\ncases; others can gain permission to use either by getting the original\nowner's permission, or by paying the owner the exclusivity price.\n\nThis accomplishes two goals. First, it fixes defaults: if someone has no\ninterest in making money off of keeping an invention or work exclusive, it\nsets the default so that it's publicly available for anyone. Second, it leads\nto more permissionlessness, and less exclusion, on the margin, by putting a\nprice on exclusion. The revenues from this tax could go into a citizen's\ndividend, or they could go into a quadratic funding pool that supports non-\nprofit science and art.\n\n### Immigration\n\nLeft: the US standard immigration system. Backlogged and unfair. Right: the US\nalternative immigration system. Honest and fair.\n\nOne of the most beautiful and deeply good ideas in early communism is the\ninternationalism: the focus on \"workers of the world uniting\" and songs like\nThe Internationale. In 2024, we are unfortunately in an age of rising\nnationalism, where it's considered normal for each nation to only care about\neach own citizens, at the expense of people unlucky enough to be born outside.\nFaced with these restrictions, some are taking matters into their own hands,\nmaking their way into wealthy countries the old-fashioned way - the way that\npretty much everyone did up until globalist schemes of social control like\npassports were introduced about a century ago.\n\nA degen communist would embrace dynamism and change, especially when it seems\nlike such dynamism and change might benefit the global poor more than anyone\nelse. Degen communists would greatly expand safe and legal pathways for people\nto visit and live where they want to visit and live, trusting in liberalized\nhousing construction, plus governments made wealthy by taxes from such\nconstruction, to build needed infrastructure for them. Restrictions would be\nfocused on keeping out particularly risky or bad actors, rather than keeping\nout almost everyone. A \"proof of stake\" scheme could be adopted where someone\ncan put down funds (or the right to make future invitations) at stake on a\nclaim that a given person will not break any rules, which would then give that\nperson an automatic right to enter. Security can be improved while total\nfreedom of movement is increased.\n\n## Decision-making in degen communism\n\nDecision-making in degen communist institutions would be democratic, and would\nfollow three equally important principles: dynamism, cross-tribal bridging and\nquality. Decisions could be made quickly, using algorithms that identify ideas\nthat are held in common across groups which normally disagree with each other,\nand which elevate quality without entrenching a fixed set of elites.\n\nThis involves a two-layer stack:\n\n  * Public discussion and consensus-finding platforms, which can allow large groups of people to rapidly participate but include mechanisms to identify points of consensus. This includes tools such as pol.is and Community Notes, which focus on cross-tribal bridging. It also includes prediction markets (eg. Polymarket), which in addition to helping communities surface good predictions, serve the role of giving intellectuals an outlet to express their conviction about their strongest and most fervent beliefs - and for others to bet against them.\n  * The final governance mechanism (eg. voting). This can use quadratic voting, though the \"cross-tribal bridging\" functionality can be enhanced by ideas like the matrix-factoring algorithm in Community Notes or by pairwise-bounded quadratic voting.\n\nThese two sets of tools together allow decisions to be made quickly, at large\nscale, and in a way that favors quality in a dynamic way that allows experts\nto quickly rise and fall with each individual topic or decision.\n\nIn all of these possible implementations, the core theme of degen communism is\nthe same. Do not try to enforce stasis. Instead, embrace the chaos of markets\nand other fast-paced human activity. At the same time, however, tweak rules in\nsuch a way that the upsides get funneled into supporting public goods\n(including quality of the governance itself), and the downsides get capped or\neven outright removed for the people who are not able to handle it. This can\nbe a way forward for everyone in the 21st century.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
