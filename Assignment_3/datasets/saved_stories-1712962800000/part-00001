Kind Of. Well...Maybe.\n\nThe FCC\u2019s New \u2018Broadband Nutrition Label\u2019 Doesn\u2019t Solve The Actual Problem:\nUnchecked Telecom Monopoly Power\n\n# No, The Internet Hasn\u2019t Gotten Worse: Just Your Outlook\n\nStudies\n\n### from the scientifically-proven-godwin dept\n\nThu, Apr 11th 2024 08:13pm - Mike Masnick\n\nAh, the good old days of the internet \u2013 a utopian paradise where everyone was\nkind, respectful, and definitely not arguing about Hitler. Or was it? A recent\nstudy published in Nature has some surprising findings that might just shatter\nyour rose-tinted glasses about this past internet that never actually existed.\nBrace yourself for a shocking revelation: the internet has always been a bit\nof a dumpster fire.\n\nThe study in question has the compelling title of \u201cpersistent interaction\npatterns across social media platforms and over time.\u201d Caitlin Dewey\nsummarizes it more simply as \u201cactually, the internet\u2019s always been this bad.\u201d\n\nThere is a tendency in all things to assume that everything is progressively\ngetting worse and everything is falling apart in a way that is uniquely new.\nAnd yet, history keeps telling us that it\u2019s not true. Violent crime rates?\nThey\u2019re hitting historic lows, despite what you may have heard. The wave of\nshoplifting? Probably didn\u2019t happen.\n\nAnd how about the internet? Is the internet awash in hate, disinfo, and\ntoxicity way more than in the good old days?\n\nWell, nope.\n\nNot according to the study. It exists, certainly, but it\u2019s no worse than in\nthe past.\n\nThe researchers went deep:\n\n> To obtain a comprehensive picture of online social media conversations, we\n> analysed a dataset of about 500 million comments from Facebook, Gab, Reddit,\n> Telegram, Twitter, Usenet, Voat and YouTube, covering diverse topics and\n> spanning over three decades\n\nThree decades, 500 million comments, eight platforms. Seems like a good place\nto start.\n\nThe team used Google\u2019s Perspective API for classifying toxicity. Some may\nquibble with this, but the Perspective API has a history of being pretty\nreliable. Nothing is perfect, but when dealing with this much data, it seems\nlike a reasonable approach. On top of that, they spot checked the results as\nwell.\n\nThe researchers found: Godwin\u2019s Law is legit. If you\u2019ll recall, the original\nformulation is: \u201cAs an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a\ncomparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches 1.\u201d Godwin himself admits it\nwas written in the form of statistical language as a joke to make it seem more\nscientific. And the researchers determined that, well, yeah, pretty much:\n\n> The toxicity of threads follows a similar pattern. To understand the\n> association between the size and toxicity of a conversation, we start by\n> grouping conversations according to their length to analyse their structural\n> differences. The grouping is implemented by means of logarithmic binning\n> (see the \u2018Logarithmic binning and conversation size\u2019 section of the Methods)\n> and the evolution of the average fraction of toxic comments in threads\n> versus the thread size intervals is reported in Fig. 2. Notably, the\n> resulting trends are almost all increasing, showing that, independently of\n> the platform and topic, the longer the conversation, the more toxic it tends\n> to be.\n\nThat said, the research also shows that when a thread gets toxic, that doesn\u2019t\nnecessarily stop the conversation.\n\n> The common beliefs that (1) online interactions inevitably devolve into\n> toxic exchanges over time and (2) once a conversation reaches a certain\n> toxicity threshold, it would naturally conclude, are not modern notions but\n> they were also prevalent in the early days of the World Wide Web. Assumption\n> 2 aligns with the Perspective API\u2019s definition of toxic language, suggesting\n> that increased toxicity reduces the likelihood of continued participation in\n> a conversation. However, this observation should be reconsidered, as it is\n> not only the peak levels of toxicity that might influence a conversation\n> but, for example, also a consistent rate of toxic content. To test these\n> common assumptions, we used a method similar to that used for measuring\n> participation; we select sufficiently long threads, divide each of them into\n> a fixed number of equal intervals, compute the fraction of toxic comments\n> for each of these intervals, average it over all threads and plot the\n> toxicity trend through the unfolding of the conversations. We find that the\n> average toxicity level remains mostly stable throughout, without showing a\n> distinctive increase around the final part of threads\n\nI would suggest that seems consistent with Techdirt\u2019s experience...\n\nBut, the study also found that there\u2019s no particular evidence that\nconversations today are particularly more toxic than in the past when looking\nover this historical data. The key factor, as always, is just the length of\nthe conversation. Average toxicity over time remains pretty constant. However,\ntoxicity increases with the length of any conversation (though at different\nrates on different platforms).\n\nAs Dewey\u2019s report notes, the approaches of different platforms can matter, but\nit doesn\u2019t appear as if the world is somehow getting worse. It\u2019s just people\nsuck. And some platforms maybe attract more of the worst people.\n\n> That finding held true across seven of the eight platforms the team\n> researched. By and large, those platforms also exhibited similar shares of\n> toxic comments. On Facebook, for instance, roughly 4 to 6% of the sampled\n> comments failed Perspective AI\u2019s toxicity test, depending on the\n> community/subject matter. On YouTube, by comparison, it\u2019s 4 to 7%. On\n> Usenet, 5 to 9%.\n>\n> Even infamously lawless, undermoderated communities like Gab and Voat didn\u2019t\n> fall so far from the norm for more mainstream platforms: About 13% of Gab\u2019s\n> comments were toxic, the researchers found, and between 10 and 19% were\n> toxic on Voat.\n>\n> There\u2019s something deeply unfashionable and counterintuitive about all of\n> this. The suggestion that online platforms have not single-handedly poisoned\n> public life is entirely out of step with the very political discourse the\n> internet is said to have polluted.\n\nDewey also quotes one of the study\u2019s authors, Walter Quattrociocchi, pointing\nout that this isn\u2019t an argument for giving up moderating.\n\n> Quattrociocchi said it would be a mistake to assume his team\u2019s findings\n> suggest that moderation policies or other platform dynamics don\u2019t matter \u2014\n> they absolutely \u201cinfluence the visibility and spread of toxic content,\u201d he\n> said. But if \u201cthe root behaviors driving toxicity are more deeply ingrained\n> in human interaction,\u201d than effective moderation might involve both removing\n> toxic content and implementing larger strategies to \u201cencourage positive\n> discourse,\u201d he added.\n\nInterventions do matter, but the internet isn\u2019t inherently making people\nterrible. And, I guess that\u2019s a bit of good news these days?\n\nFiled Under: research, studies, toxicity\n\n58 CommentsLeave a Comment\n\nIf you liked this post, you may also be interested in...\n\n  * Studies Show Flock's ALPRs Reduce Crime...

I can\u2019t find where there is a comparison between\ndecades in the study, but I can find multiple figures using proxies to compare\nacross a conversation lifetime (emphasis mine):\n\n> Finally, using a similar approach, we studied the toxicity content of\n> conversations versus their lifetime\u2014that is, the time elapsed between the\n> first and last comment. In this case, most trends are flat, and there is no\n> indication that toxicity is generally associated either with the duration of\n> a conversation or the lifetime of user interactions (Extended Data Fig. 4).\n\nIn Extended Data Fig. 4, the lifetime is indicated in days. Moreover, in the\ndiscussion (emphasis mine):\n\n> Our analysis approach is based on breadth and heterogeneity. As such, it may\n> raise concerns about potential reductionism due to the comparison of\n> different datasets from different sources and time periods. [...] However,\n> we aim not to capture the full depth of every discussion but to identify and\n> highlight general patterns and trends in online toxicity across platforms\n> and time.\n\nIt seems that the authors use \u201ctime periods\u201d for the evolution between\ndecades, and \u201ctime\u201d for the timescale of a single conversation.\n\nNow given that the different subjects and platform data come from different\ntime periods, one could try to infer some information about the evolution of\ntoxicity. And it seems the authors have done that privately (from the quoted\nCaitlin Dewey newsletter):\n\n> \u201cThe toxicity level in online conversations has been relatively consistent\n> over time, challenging the perception of a continual decline in the quality\n> of discourse,\u201d said Walter Quattrociocchi, one of the study\u2019s authors, in an\n> email. \u201cWhile the platforms and how we use them have evolved, human\n> behaviors in these spaces have remained surprisingly stable.\u201d\n\nBut then I wouldn\u2019t use the study as proof of that, only this quote.

From\nthis study, at least. Sure, the internet might have always been full of\nassholes, but the internet hasn\u2019t always been a central part of everyone\u2019s\nlife.\n\nBetween 2000, and 2024, internet use among the public grew from about 40% to\nalmost 100%. During the same time, broadband use went from 0% to 80%.\nSubstantially more people are spending more time online.\n\nhttps://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/internet-broadband/\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nAnonymous Coward says:\n\nApril 12, 2024 at 9:33 am\n\nConversations between individuals have stayed largely the same, sure, I can\nbelieve that. But the Internet has gotten worse and more toxic in other ways.\n\nWe are seeing a lot more structural toxicity as bigots and other toxic\nindividuals organize or re-organize into full campaigns or gather around\nprovocateurs who tell them what they want to hear, said provocateurs being on\nYouTube, Twitter, Reddit, Discord, Steam, and more.\n\nOne horrid thing that this has led to: In the last few months, GamerGate\nreared its ugly head again in the form of angry right-wing gamers slinging\nharassment and abuse at writers, writing consultant companies, and community\nmanagers. These people are using platforms such as Discord to gather and talk,\nand then Steam\u2019s Community features to move in and harass and attack the\ncreators and community managers of games. The game South Of Midnight has had\nits Steam Community Forums inundated with racists. Alongside this, Steam\nitself doesn\u2019t bat an eye as it lets horrid people such as Alex Jones publish\ngames with racist and conspiratorial messages.\n\nThe scale of harassment, the organized nature of it, and the level of\npermissiveness that platforms are allowing feels like it goes beyond what\nwe\u2019ve seen in the past. KotakuInAction, a GamerGate Subreddit, has been\nallowed to fester and foment and exist for nearly a decade now because Reddit\njust refuses to ban it. Even though when they banned other Subreddits like\nr/fatpeoplehate and another one called r/(racist slur for black people)town,\ntoxicity had gone down site wide.\n\nReddit also had the opportunity to delete r/the_donald and remove a lot of\ntoxicity from their site when that Subreddit was still active. They only\nremoved it when it was a ghost town. It became a ghost town because Reddit\ngave them enough time to organize and build out their own website.\n\nSo I disagree with the stance of this article. I think the Internet has indeed\ngotten worse.\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nAnonymous Coward says:\n\nApril 12, 2024 at 10:33 am\n\n# Re:\n\nThe Ku Klux Klan would like to remind you that they organized cross-burnings\njust fucking fine without the Internet, emboldened by the Jim Crow bullshit of\nits era.\n\nCato the Elder would also like to remind you, from his grave, that Carthage\nmust burn.\n\nFox News would also like to remind you its sole purpose was to ensure that the\nSouthern Strategy would be a terminal success, and its entire goal is to\nentrench a Republican Presidency into power, and it didn\u2019t need a stinkin\u2019\nInternet to do that, just Nixon and something called Watergate...\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nAnonymous Coward says:\n\nApril 12, 2024 at 10:05 am\n\nYou know, what I\u2019m interested in seeing is how the AI decides what is and\nisn\u2019t \u201ca rude, disrespectful or unreasonable comment likely to make someone\nleave a discussion\u201d, since many AIs don\u2019t do nuance well if at all, words that\nmight be considered \u201ctoxic\u201d indicators now might not have made said\nconversations so in the past, and depending on what training data was used,\nmay not actually be accurate at all.

We're in Texas and ended up driving pretty far out to where it was predicted to be clearer and we had a great view.\n  * John Roddy: It's funny. I've actually been going around telling people that Sun is currently nearing the peak of its 11-year cycle and has been unusually active recently.\n  * Didn't even occur to me that you'd be able to *see* that during the eclipse.\n  * Because the corona is where all of that really shows.\n  * Also spaceweather.gov\n  * Not enough government websites have a chart on their homepage that shows real-time updates on the current measured proton flux.\n  * mildconcern: fantastic, I'm glad you got to see it too.\n  * And yes they were three solar flares going, one of which was big enough to be seen by the naked eye\n  * only two small sun spots though\n  * John Roddy: No, that's one *gigantic* sun spot.\n  * Mike Masnick: the weirdest thing, though, was we had no traffic at all. we found a small town in texas that was a bit off the beaten path, but looked like the weather would cooperate, and we drove 75 miles from our hotel to it, saw no traffic. was able to park easily, even grabbed a nice picnic table in a gazebo. soon after we got there, the park started to fill up, but it never got *crowded*. and then afterwards, we drove back and hit no traffic on the way back either. the only \"line\" we ran into was when stopped at a pie shop on our way back to get some pie to celebrate\n  * mildconcern: I think a lot of the real fanatics ditched going to Texas all together\n  * a fair few folks in the park I was at had plans to be there and then switched up at the last minute with the forecasts to come to New England instead\n  * The town I was in moved their location from the smaller park downtown to this bigger one just two days before the event because of the same factors\n  * Mike Masnick: like absolutely nothing has been crowded (other than the pie stand). pickup line for rental car was non existent. no traffic to the hotel. hotel did not seem crowded at all. everything has been smooth sailing.\n  * mildconcern: The second biggest cheer of the day (after totality) happened when a truck arrived with six more porta potties to help alleviate the hour long line\n  * But it was fun having a crowd. I brought my telescope which made me popular, and it was great letting other people look through it\n  * John Roddy: It was so overcast for me that I legit couldn't even see clouds.\n  * mildconcern: I wasn't really aiming to take pictures primarily but I did get a few\n  * John Roddy: Just a perfectly homogenous gray.\n  * mildconcern: https://www.instagram.com/p/C5jo...\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/C5jo_1bvI0S/?igsh=cW85dnc5czF4Zzg4\n\n  * Mike Masnick: Heh. Yeah, the park we were in had fixed bathrooms (and even cleaned them right after the eclipse so we had clean bathrooms to use before heading out) and a big row of porta potties, but neither ever got crowded. there was a *good* sized crowd but never got crowded\n  * The one thing we didn't really have where we were was a good view of the 360 degree sunset. I remember that from the last one we saw. but didn't really see it this time due to trees around the park.\n  * You should have driven over to where we were! No traffic, very few clouds.\n  * mildconcern: yeah I did not have as good a view of the 360 as I did in Casper Wyoming. It was pretty good and you got a sense of it because we were on a lakeshore but the other angles were mountains\n  * John Roddy: Unfortunately, I had a dentist appointment at just barely after the right time. :/\n  * Which is the only reason I'm able to eat anything again.\n  * Mike Masnick: we really lucked out in 2017, because we found this random hill in the middle of absolute nowhere, eastern oregon, that gave us a 360 degrees view of NOTHING but fields from the top. It was a perfect spot to watch\n  * John Roddy: They had to try like 20 different times to get the right set of x-rays.\n  * Mike Masnick: Yikes.\n  * John Roddy: So I'm expecting to grow a second tongue within the next few days or something.\n  * Interestingly, x-ray tech has finally been miniaturized enough that the camera is entirely handheld now.\n  * The tube just has a really thick glass shield lining the end of it, presumably lined with lead.\n  * deadspatula: Fascinatingly, the big advancement has been in better dosing, not simply the size of components. The big machines needed a big burst and leaked a lot of x-rays. That's why the dentist had to hide behind the lead wall and we covered the reproductive organs - the dose wasn't bad once every six months, but multiple times a day would be serious. And the units therefore needed to be mounted. The handheld units better direct a much lower dose, and manufacturers claim technicians do not get dangerous doses of stray x-rays. That said, the notable property of x-rays is penetration. Many of the units I've seen have a guard as you describe, but nothing opaque, and if its not opaque its not lined with enough lead to matter.\n  * John Roddy: Lead lined glass is almost certainly more than enough to at least scatter any stray x-rays that find their way back.\n  * But yeah, x-ray tech in general got a pretty significant overhaul in the past decade or so.\n  * When Chandra launched in '99, it was the heaviest payload the shuttle ever carried.\n  * Fast forward to '21, and we've got IXPE.\n  * Chandra is close to 6,000kg.\n  * IXPE is just over 300.\n  * mildconcern: I wonder how much the general advancement of detectors driven by the cell phone camera revolution has spilled over. That certainly has helped the field of astronomical detection quite a bit.\n  * Digital sensors that had laughable resolution used to cost a fortune in the 1990s when they started to come out. And now you can get miracle devices for far less.\n  * John Roddy: Cell phone stuff is all in the microwave range.\n  * That's most useful for detecting the cosmic microwave background, which is probably the closest thing to a natural encyclopedia we're ever going to get.\n  * mildconcern: phone cameras also do sense visual light\n  * John Roddy: I feel like everyone I tell this to is hearing it for the first time, but...\n  * I *thought* it was common knowledge that your phone camera is pretty good at seeing infrared too.\n  * It's a really quick and easy way to check if a remote control is working.\n  * Infrared LEDs *will* be visible through the sensor.\n  * mildconcern: Oh yeah I knew that, I was just being a wiseass\n  * it's not hugely far in the infrared spectrum\n  * can't use it as a heat detector or something. Just a smidge.\n  * but I'm mostly saying in terms of astronomy applications. The overall success in designing sensors and detectors in smaller scales has hugely helped anyway\n  * no matter the wavelengths\n  * John Roddy: Yeah, the interesting stuff requires some pretty intense tech.\n  * Almost everything glows in the infrared spectrum, after all.\n  * mildconcern: It's a big part of why they stuck the JWT in space\n  * since it's mostly working in that range\n  * John Roddy: That's only half the story\n  * Spritzer needed some pretty extreme shielding too.\n  * Except the tech wasn't *quite* ready to make the active cooling reliable enough.\n  * A lot of people think of \"cold\" in terms of what chilly weather feels like on earth.\n  * The cold air sucks the heat right out of you.\n  * But space doesn't have that air.\n  * So despite space being extremely cold, it's actually really hard to cool things down out there.\n  * The reason the space shuttle always had the bay doors open in orbit is because that's where the radiators were.\n  * mildconcern: yeah. but the IR wavelengfths that JWT are detecting can't even get through at all even in Earth orbit\n  * so that's why it's out at the Lagrange Point\n  * Despite the \"can't fuck this one up and fix it later\" nature of that as opposed to Hubble\n  * John Roddy: It's not even *at* the Lagrange point\n  * It's in an orbit around it\n\nBecome an Insider!\n\nRecent Stories\n\n## Friday  \n  \n---  \n09:26| Once Again, ExTwitter Makes Links Dangerous; The Kind Of Thing A Trust\n& Safety Team Would Catch (12)  \n05:22| The FCC's New 'Broadband Nutrition Label' Doesn't Solve The Actual\nProblem: Unchecked Telecom Monopoly Power (6)  \n  \n## Thursday  \n  \n20:13| No, The Internet Hasn\u2019t Gotten Worse: Just Your Outlook (58)  \n15:16| Apple App Store Update Says Emulation Is Coming Back.
