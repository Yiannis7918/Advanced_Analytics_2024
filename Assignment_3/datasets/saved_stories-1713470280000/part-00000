We were having dinner\nand the topic got to business ideas.\n\nIt was clear from how he was speaking that long-term in whatever capacity he\nwould venture out and look to create his ideas.\n\nHe then posed an interesting question to me, what advice would I offer him as\nsomeone who has started their own company.\n\nAs flattered as I was, I believe that our journey at Peritus Partners is still\nvery much formulating but I did share that I will go out and answer the\nquestion for him and anyone else in a similar position from someone who has\nbeen in their shoes.\n\nThis article is an eye-opener.\n\nIt breaks through the noise of starting your own company and tackles head-on\nkey elements that many people miss.\n\nThe individual responsible for helping me bring this to life is Brian\nPontarelli, the founder and CEO of fusionauth (https://fusionauth.io/) and\nsoftware engineer at heart. Brian and his team have built an authentication\nand authorisation platform for developers, he has raised financing, grown the\nteam, and gracefully looked back at the beginning of the company with me to\nprovide some of the best advice I have ever been shared \u2013 I say this with\nintention, what we share here is powerful and life-changing to those looking\nto embark on creating their own company, take every aspect of this article\nwith you on your journey as I know it will help.\n\nWhy set out to start your own company in the first place?\n\nEvery day, our minds buzz with countless ideas. You might be strolling to work\nwhen suddenly; a spark of inspiration strikes. Or, while completing a task,\nyou realise there's a more efficient way to do it. Maybe you are like me,\nworking in an industry where you see potential for superior service to clients\nand wish to pursue it.\n\nThe key takeaway from Brian is this: unless you're entirely devoted to\nlaunching your own business and persevering through the challenges, it's wise\nto wait. When the urge to make independent choices becomes irresistible,\nthat's when you're truly prepared. At that moment, you're ready to face any\nsurprise that comes your way and believe it, many will come unexpectedly.\n\nEmbarking on a journey for fame and fortune may yield success in favourable\nmarket conditions. However, when challenges arise, such as facing tough times,\nthe allure of stable employment, or the necessity to make difficult choices,\nthat's when you and your venture might face a real test of resilience that\ncould be too much if you enter with the wrong reasons to begin with.\n\nSignificant challenges and overcoming them...\n\nGoing from an individual contributor with an idea or even a leader of a team\nand venturing out to build something of your own will bring with it many\nunknowns. Brian shared that the first that he encounters from many looking to\nstart is Analysis Paralysis.\n\nThe fear of actually starting something. The fear of it not being successful.\nThe fear of being judged. The fear of not knowing how to start.\n\nAll these factors stop individuals from building something the world might\ntruly need and are the first big challenge you need to overcome. It links back\nto the former comments about why you should start in the first place. When\nthat feeling overwhelms you, use that fear to drive decisions and get the\nwheels moving, you will soon realise that the fear holding you back is nothing\nmore than your thoughts.\n\nOnce moving however, it is wise to take note of these common challenges that\ncould make or break your idea very quickly.\n\nUnderstanding the market\n\nBrian explained that nobody will sit down with you to price your product and\nshare who your clients are, consultants will charge but not always get it\nright, mentors can guide but you need to be aware of your idea, the market in\nwhich you are looking to enter and the client base you hope to sell to.\n\nCreating buying personas is a good starting point but there is nothing better\nthan simply going out there, speaking and absorbing what your potential market\nis sharing. You might find your idea needs iteration, your pricing needs\nadjusting, or you are on the right track.\n\nBrian also shared that even if you are the CTO of the venture, eventually you\nwill need to sell your products to clients and a good tactic is to learn about\nframing. Framing is not lying or manipulating a stakeholder rather it is about\nchoosing the best perspective to communicate your value proposition. If you\nare not aware of framing, this is your chance to dive deeper and explore it\noutside of this article.\n\nHiring the right team\n\nAnother significant challenge you might face is hiring the right team. This is\nnot a plug to say using a recruiter is the right way or solely hiring by\nyourself, both will bring advantages, but one thing Brian did stress in the\nearly years is that you build yourself a framework based on what you need to\ntest across every role required to build your company.\n\nIt is very easy to be impressed with jargon, especially when hiring for roles\noutside your expertise. To avoid this, focus on identifying the essential\nskills for each position and devise questions that test these skills. For\ninstance, when hiring an accountant, you will likely require this individual\nto be very organised, if you simply ask \u2018are you organised\u2019 you will be met\nwith a very basic \u2018yes\u2019 but the key question is how do you really know this?\n\nInstead, Brian would ask \u2018how do you organise your wardrobe\u2019. This disarms the\nindividual as they are not aware you are testing organisation but instead you\ncan learn about how they organise in their own life which tests the underlying\nskill.\n\nWith a framework in place next it is wise to lean into your friends and\nnetwork. You know these individuals or someone you trust does and this helps\nbuild rapport quicker and can get the project moving in the direction required\nfaster. Focus on looking at individuals you would work with anywhere, no\nmatter it being your company or not, then entice them with stock and a\nmission.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t always work when you hire friends, but it has for many, and it\ncould for you.\n\nProduct Market Fit\n\nAlthough Brian and fusionauth didn\u2019t have this issue directly themselves, they\nwere fortunate to have two products that took to market quickly, he\nappreciates that this is rare and more often not the case. As a result, you\nwill likely need to adapt your product offering based on your customer base.\n\nThis is business building 101, if you do not have a product that is required\nfrom the market, it doesn\u2019t matter how much time, money, and energy you\ninvest, it simply won\u2019t work in the long run. Brian highlighted that you\nshould give your customers a way to tell you exactly what is wrong with your\nproduct.\n\nCustomer interviewers are often designed in a way that shares the positives\nwhich strokes your ego but does little to move the needle in the direction of\nimprovements.\n\nTo gain real honest feedback adopt the question \u2018tell us everything not right\nwith the product\u2019 \u2013 this will give you more to work with than everything you\ndid right.\n\nEncountering what nobody previously shared...\n\nStarting a business, as Brian experienced with fusionauth, involves many\nunanticipated challenges. These aspects often remain undisclosed, not due to a\nlack of support, but because they are hard to anticipate without personal\nexperience or guidance from a seasoned network. Brian discovered a crucial\nlesson in valuing money (be it dollars, euros, or pounds). When you're\naccountable for approving expenses, it becomes evident what's essential and\nwhat's expendable.\n\nBrian also highlighted an often-overlooked aspect: customer interaction. This\ncan be a steep learning curve, especially for those not from sales or\ncustomer-oriented backgrounds. You'll encounter customers who may treat\nvendors with varying degrees of respect. Understanding who you're dealing with\ncan shape your approach and help you understand their behaviour. If a customer\ntreats you poorly, it's often better to part ways early, saving energy for\nmore deserving clients.\n\nMoreover, the mantra 'show, don\u2019t tell' is vital. Demonstrating your offerings\nhelps address challenging questions effectively, and your enthusiasm for your\nproduct or solution can be contagious, fostering similar excitement in your\ncustomers.\n\nApproaching innovation in your own company\n\nAs technology evolves rapidly, it becomes increasingly challenging to discern\nwhich innovations should be included in your roadmap and which might just be\ndistractions amidst the current hype. Brian shared valuable insights on how\nhis team navigates this terrain, a strategy they continue to use.\n\nListening to customers is key in maintaining focus. Through well-conducted\nfeedback sessions, customers can highlight necessary bug fixes and desired\nfeatures, offering clear direction for your roadmap.\n\nHowever, this doesn't mean you should overlook technological advancements.\nThey demand continuous evaluation and can unveil new business opportunities or\nenhance your current offerings. But it's important not to pursue every new\ntrend. A tactical approach is essential, and remember, it's the everyday\noperations where you truly add value.\n\nAdvice to get going...\n\nYou're probably familiar with the concept of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP),\nwhich is essential for testing market demand with a simplified version of your\nproduct, allowing for adjustments based on feedback.\n\nBrian advises that you should critically assess your idea, focusing on what\naspect you believe will most quickly and easily generate revenue and attract\ncustomers. This approach involves setting aside an elaborate roadmap\ntemporarily. Over-planning can lead to under-delivering, and in reality,\ncustomer feedback often drives the evolution of your plan, guiding necessary\npivots.\n\nHowever, do not rush to market with a subpar product just to claim you have an\nMVP. A poorly executed MVP can deter potential customers. Instead, view your\nMVP as a foundational platform, something you can enhance and build upon as\nyour customer base grows and you secure further investment. It should be a\nstarting point for development, not a disposable prototype.\n\nAnd to not do when starting your company\n\nReading this should inspire you to delve into the ideas you've been\ncontemplating. While entrepreneurship isn't for everyone, and success isn't\nguaranteed, if you feel a strong inclination, it's likely that you'll pursue\nit eventually. The guidance we've relayed from Brian, particularly about what\nnot to do when starting your own company, is timeless.\n\nFirstly, avoid making fundraising your initial focus. Concentrate on\ndeveloping a remarkable product and being adaptable in targeting the right\nmarket and acquiring customers. If you manage these aspects well, financial\nsuccess and investor interest will naturally follow.\n\nSecondly, if your business concept is heavily dependent on technology and you\nlack technical expertise, it's crucial to partner with a tech-savvy co-\nfounder. This collaboration can bridge the gap between your vision and the\ntechnological execution required to bring your ideas to life.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed researching and writing this article. Learning from\nBrian's vast experience and knowledge was enlightening, and I can only hope I\nhave done the conversation justice.\n\nEmbarking on the journey of starting your own company is no small feat,\nsomething I can attest to personally. It involves long hours and unexpected\nstressors, tackling tasks that may be outside your skillset, and financial\nchallenges - transitioning from a steady income to potentially no earnings for\na while.\n\nYet, the drive to create something of value, something that can positively\nimpact the world, makes all these challenges worthwhile. It's about having the\nright mindset and purpose from the outset, which can make all the difference\nin your entrepreneurial journey.\n\nInterested in starting your own thing?
