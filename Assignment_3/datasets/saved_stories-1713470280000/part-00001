We described that effort here. Ultimately, the\nHPSCI-sponsored bill (the FRRA) was pulled from the floor without receiving a\nvote.\n\nHPSCI is back with a new effort, with the same goal\u2014to overrule decisions of\nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) and the Foreign\nIntelligence Surveillance Court of Review (FISCR) interpreting the current\nstatutory definition of \u201celectronic communication service providers\u201d (ECSPs)\neligible to receive FISA 702 directives much more narrowly than the government\nwanted. Consistent with the plain statutory language, those decisions appear\nto have excluded from compelled assistance under FISA 702 non-communication\nservice providers who lack direct access to communications streams but who\nmerely have access to equipment on which communications are transmitted or\nstored.\n\nAs described in our prior blog post, the FRRA painted with too broad a brush\nand would have permitted the government to compel assistance not only from\ndata centers, colocation providers, and business landlords, but also from\noperators and employees of shared workspaces, hotels where guests connect to\nthe Internet, as well as from any third party involved in providing equipment,\nstorage, or even cleaning services to such entities. It did so by dropping the\nrequirement that the recipient of a FISA 702 directive be a \u201ccommunication\u201d\nservice provider, by expressly making access to equipment alone enough for\neligibility, and by adding the term \u201ccustodian\u201d as a person that could be\nasked to provide assistance.\n\nThe new amendment is a marginal improvement over the last go-around, but it is\nstill problematic. It is not a change that \u201cnarrowly updates the definition of\nelectronic communication service provider under Section 702.\u201d Like the FRRA,\nit: (1) drops the qualifier \u201ccommunication\u201d from the class of covered \u201cservice\nproviders;\u201d (2) makes access to communications-carrying equipment enough to\nestablish eligibility; and (3) adds \u201ccustodian\u201d to the list of individuals who\ncan be forced to provide assistance. But unlike the FRRA, it then enumerates a\nlist of business types that cannot be considered ECSPs, including public\naccommodations, dwellings, restaurants, and community facilities.\n\nThe new amendment would \u2014 notwithstanding these exclusions \u2014 still permit the\ngovernment to compel the assistance of a wide range of additional entities and\npersons in conducting surveillance under FISA 702. The breadth of the new\ndefinition is obvious from the fact that the drafters felt compelled to\nexclude such ordinary places such as senior centers, hotels, and coffee shops.\nBut for these specific exceptions, the scope of the new definition would cover\nthem\u2014and scores of businesses that did not receive a specific exemption remain\nwithin its purview.\n\nAnd even with these specific exceptions, the definition would include, for\nexample, the owners and operators of facilities that house equipment used to\nstore or carry data, such as data centers and buildings owned by commercial\nlandlords, who merely have access to communications equipment in their\nphysical space. It could also include other persons with access to such\nfacilities and equipment, including delivery personnel, cleaning contractors,\nand utility providers. It also means that any U.S. business could have its\ncommunications (if one side is foreign) tapped by a landlord with access to\noffice wiring, or the data centers where their computers reside, even if it\neliminates the possibility that the same surveillance could be conducted with\nthe assistance of hotels, restaurants, or community centers. For a specific\nhypothetical example of how this surveillance could occur, see our prior blog\npost. That\u2019s not a \u201cnarrow\u201d change.\n\nDoes the new HPSCI amendment represent a significant expansion of the universe\nof 702 recipients? Absolutely. Like the FRRA, it would go a long way toward\neffectively restoring the broad assistance provision of FISA 702\u2019s\npredecessor, the Protect America Act, which Congress specifically rejected\nwhen it originally enacted FISA 702 in 2008. While it would (relative to the\nFRRA) reduce the likelihood that individual U.S. persons\u2019 communications could\nbe collected by someone other than their communication service providers, it\u2019s\nstill a clear play for more access to communications among businesses that\nemploy many U.S. persons.\n\nMost problematically, it would expand the use of warrantless surveillance\nunder FISA 702 into a variety of new contexts where there is a particularly\nhigh likelihood that the communications of U.S. citizens and other persons in\nthe U.S. will be \u201cinadvertently\u201d acquired by the government. This amendment\nwill expand the government\u2019s use of FISA 702 to acquire communications.\nCongress should be fully aware of that when it considers this amendment.\n\nPrev\n\n/\n\nNext\n\n###### Related Tags\n\nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) Surveillance\n\n###### You Might Also Like\n\n  * ###### Law Enforcement\n\n### House Intelligence Committee FISA \u201cReform\u201d Bill Would Greatly Expand the\nClass of Businesses and Other Entities Required to Assist in FISA 702\nSurveillance\n\n  * ###### Law Enforcement\n\n### Congress Unveils Bill That Would Overhaul Government Surveillance Laws,\nIncluding ECPA\n\n  * ###### Practical Advice\n\n### The Future of AI Governance: Key Provisions in President Biden\u2019s Executive\nOrder\n\n  * ###### Law Enforcement\n\n### D.C.
