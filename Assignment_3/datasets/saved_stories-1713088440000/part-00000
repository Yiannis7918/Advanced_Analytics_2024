York Times bestselling author Hampton Sides, an epic account of the\nmost momentous voyage of the Age of Exploration, which culminated in Captain\nJames Cook\u2019s death in Hawaii, and left a complex and controversial legacy\nstill debated to this day.\n\n\u201cSides has mastered the art of you-are-there historical narrative. A thrilling\nand necessary update to one of history\u2019s most consequential cultural\ncollisions.\u201d \u2014John Vaillant, New York Times bestselling author of Fire Weather\nand The Tiger\n\nOn July 12th, 1776, Captain James Cook, already lionized as the greatest\nexplorer in British history, set off on his third voyage in his ship the HMS\nResolution. Two-and-a-half years later, on a beach on the island of Hawaii,\nCook was killed in a conflict with native Hawaiians. How did Cook, who was\nunique among captains for his respect for Indigenous peoples and cultures,\ncome to that fatal moment?\n\nHampton Sides\u2019 bravura account of Cook\u2019s last journey both wrestles with\nCook\u2019s legacy and provides a thrilling narrative of the titanic efforts and\ncontinual danger that characterized exploration in the 1700s. Cook was\nrenowned for his peerless seamanship, his humane leadership, and his\ndedication to science-\u2013the famed naturalist Joseph Banks accompanied him on\nhis first voyage, and Cook has been called one of the most important figures\nof the Age of Enlightenment. He was also deeply interested in the native\npeople he encountered. In fact, his stated mission was to return a Tahitian\nman, Mai, who had become the toast of London, to his home islands. On previous\nexpeditions, Cook mapped huge swaths of the Pacific, including the east coast\nof Australia, and initiated first European contact with numerous peoples. He\ntreated his crew well, and endeavored to learn about the societies he\nencountered with curiosity and without judgment.\n\nYet something was different on this last voyage. Cook became mercurial,\nresorting to the lash to enforce discipline, and led his two vessels into\ndanger time and again. Uncharacteristically, he ordered violent retaliation\nfor perceived theft on the part of native peoples. This may have had something\nto do with his secret orders, which were to chart and claim lands before\nBritain\u2019s imperial rivals could, and to discover the fabled Northwest Passage.\nWhatever Cook\u2019s intentions, his scientific efforts were the sharp edge of the\ncolonial sword, and the ultimate effects of first contact were catastrophic\nfor Indigenous people around the world. The tensions between Cook\u2019s overt and\ncovert missions came to a head on the shores of Hawaii. His first landing\nthere was harmonious, but when Cook returned after mapping the coast of the\nPacific Northwest and Alaska, his exploitative treatment of the Hawaiians led\nto the fatal encounter.\n\nAt once a ferociously-paced story of adventure on the high seas and a\nsearching examination of the complexities and consequences of the Age of\nExploration, THE WIDE WIDE SEA is a major work from one of our finest\nnarrative nonfiction writers.\n\n## About The Wide Wide Sea\n\nFrom New York Times bestselling author Hampton Sides, an epic account of the\nmost momentous voyage of the Age of Exploration, which culminated in Captain\nJames Cook\u2019s death in Hawaii, and left a complex and controversial legacy\nstill debated to this day.\n\n\u201cSides has mastered the art of you-are-there historical narrative.

The result is a work that\nwill enthrall Cook\u2019s admirers, inform his critics and entertain everyone in\nbetween.\u201d \u2014Los Angeles Times\n\n\u201cWith gripping prose, Sides details Cook\u2019s increasingly erratic behavior as he\nexplored vast swaths of the Pacific and scrambled to find the fabled Northwest\nPassage along the ice-choked coast of Alaska. His account lays bare the Age of\nExploration\u2019s moral perils, which continue to reverbarate today.\u201d \u2014Outside\nMagazine\n\n\u201cThe Wide Wide Sea portrays Cook as a complicated figure driven by instincts\nand motives that often seem to have been opaque even to him. . . [A]s Cook\nhimself seemed to have realized, and at times lamented, he was but an\ninstrument in a much, much larger scheme.\u201d \u2014The New Yorker\n\n\u201cAn acclaimed historian takes to the sea in this rousing tale of exploration\n... Sides draws on numerous contemporaneous sources to create a fascinating,\nimmersive adventure story featuring just the right amount of historical\ncontext ... Lusciously detailed and insightful history, masterfully told.\u201d\n\u2014Kirkus Reviews, (starred)\n\n\u201cThis exquisitely crafted and novelistic portrait of the mercurial captain\nenthralls.\u201d \u2014Publishers Weekly, (starred)\n\n\u201cBeautifully written and impeccably researched, The Wide Wide Sea will delight\nreaders new to the topic as well as those versed in earlier looks at James\nCook and his milieu.\u201d \u2014Booklist\n\n\u201cThe Wide Wide Sea transports the reader to one of the most thrilling eras of\nhuman exploration. With deft use of the words of Cook\u2019s own men and the oral\ntraditions of the Indigenous people whose lands they visited, Hampton Sides\nhas conjured Cook\u2019s fatal voyage in all its extraordinary and tragic\nmagnificence.\u201d \u2014Caroline Alexander, New York Times bestselling author of The\nEndurance and The Bounty\n\n\u201cIn all the annals of exploration, Cook\u2019s last journey around the world stands\nout for its fascination, tragedy, and sheer epic scope. Hampton Sides does\njustice to this extraordinary history, vividly capturing its splendor,\nviolence, and madness. Here are stories within stories, deeply researched and\nwoven into a tapestry that brings to life Captain Cook, his times, and the\noceans he explored. More than that, it portrays in a nuanced and respectful\nway those peoples impacted by his final voyage\u2014including the Aboriginal\nTasmanians, the M\u0101ori, the Tahitians, the Hawaiians, and Native Alaskans. I\nhighly recommend this fantastic book.\u201d \u2014Douglas Preston, #1 bestselling author\nof The Lost City of the Monkey God and Cities of Gold\n\n\u201cHampton Sides has a gift for taking stories you thought you knew and making\nthem feel fresh and revelatory. Along the way, he has also mastered the art of\nyou-are-there historical narrative. In The Wide Wide Sea, this combination is\nirresistible: fascinating and horrifying by turns, Sides puts us on deck with\nCaptain Cook, one of the world\u2019s greatest and most disciplined explorers, as\nhe comes undone in real time, in ways that make comparisons to our current\nplanetary moment inescapable. This is a thrilling and necessary update to one\nof history\u2019s most consequential cultural collisions.\u201d \u2014John Vaillant, New York\nTimes bestselling author of Fire Weather and The Tiger\n\n\u201cSo much is made of Western \u2018civilized\u2019 explorers heading out on grand\nadventures, but seldom is anything said of Indigenous people on their own\njourneys of exploration into the heart of whiteness. In The Wide Wide Sea,\nHampton Sides does just that. Alongside the narrative of Cook\u2019s voyage, Sides\ntells the gripping story of a young Pacific Islander named Mai, plucked from\nhis home in Tahiti in the late 18th century and brought to England as a\ncuriosity only to return to the South Pacific four years later. With quietly\nforceful and meticulous research, Sides gives us a tale that is fascinating,\nimportant, and inexplicably sad.\u201d \u2014David Treuer, New York Times bestselling\nauthor of The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee and Rez Life\n\n\u201cAn instant classic. . . this majestic account reminds us just how deep runs\nour desire to know the shape and limits of our world. Dispatched from England\nto seek the Northwest Passage, Captain Cook braved violent storms and unknown\nshores while coping with his own growing demons. Drawing on a wealth of detail\nfrom the crew\u2019s diarists and judiciously applying modern interpretation, Sides\nbrings Cook\u2019s glorious and tragic final act to shimmering life.\u201d \u2014Dean King,\nNew York Times bestselling author of A Sea of Words, Skeletons on the Zahara,\nand Patrick O\u2019Brian: A Life Revealed\n\n\u201cHere is an adventure so strange and epic it rivals the greatest tales of\nmyth. The cast of characters includes a restless Captain Cook, an anxious King\nGeorge III on the verge of losing his American colonies, a London high society\nnewly infatuated with the romance of the \u201cnoble savage,\u201d and a good-natured\nyoung Polynesian man heartily bent on an inter-island massacre. Sides turns\nthis riveting narrative into a cautionary tale about the heedless cruelty of\ncolonialism and the collateral damage that can result from even the best-\nintentioned first contact.\u201d \u2014Peter Heller, New York Times bestselling author\nof The Dog Stars, The River, and The Guide\n\n\u201cJames Cook was the paragon of eighteenth-century navigators and the master of\nPacific exploration. With The Wide Wide Sea, Hampton Sides has crafted an\nenthralling new account of Cook\u2019s last voyage and death, based upon careful\nresearch that sensitively balances European attitudes and Indigenous\nreactions.\u201d \u2014John B. Hattendorf, professor emeritus of the U.S. Naval War\nCollege and editor-in-chief of the Oxford Encyclopedia of Maritime History\n\n\u201cThere is no finer writer than Hampton Sides to pilot a narrative so densely\npacked with adventure, drama, and moral complexity. The Wide Wide Sea braids\nthe sweeping flair of a Patrick O\u2019Brian novel with Nathaniel Philbrick\u2019s\nboundless love for the world\u2019s wild oceans. Here is a saga as tautly tuned as\nan eighteenth-century sailing ship, told by a master storyteller at the height\nof his powers.\u201d \u2014Kevin Fedarko, New York Times bestselling author of The\nEmerald Mile\n\n\u201cA rare gift: One of the world\u2019s greatest storytellers tells one of the\nworld\u2019s greatest stories, in this thrilling, clear-eyed account.\u201d \u2014Julian\nSancton, New York Times bestselling author of Madhouse at the End of the Earth\n\n\u201cHampton Sides has embarked on a voyage to understand what drove this\nextraordinary but controversial explorer. Skillfully navigating the shoals of\nmyth, he transports readers back in time to give us a presence at Cook\u2019s\nhistoric encounters with the peoples of the Pacific and Northwest America.\u201d\n\u2014Cliff Thornton, former president of the international Captain Cook Society\n\nLooking for More Great Reads? 21 Books You\u2019ve Been Meaning to Read\n\nDownload Hi Res\n\nThe Wide Wide Sea\n\n#### Category: World History | Biography & Memoir\n\n#### Category: World History | Biography & Memoir\n\n#### Category: World History | Biography & Memoir\n\n#### Category: World History | Biography & Memoir | Audiobooks\n\n#### Category: World History | Biography & Memoir | Audiobooks\n\nThe Wide Wide Sea\n\n## Buy Now\n\nHardcover\n\nApr 09, 2024 | ISBN 9780385544764\n\nLarge Print\n\nApr 09, 2024 | ISBN 9780593863183\n\nEbook\n\nApr 09, 2024 | ISBN 9780385544771\n\nAudiobook Download\n\nApr 09, 2024 | ISBN 9780593821329 | 942 Minutes\n\nCD\n\nApr 23, 2024 | ISBN 9780593821312 | 930 Minutes\n\nSee All Formats (4) +\n\nNever miss a new book by Hampton Sides\n\nDismiss\n\nBack to Top\n\nGET PERSONALIZED BOOK RECS \ud83d\udcda\n\nConnect\n\nSign up for news about books, authors, and more from Penguin Random House\n\nAn Inbox Worth Reading\n\nglobal.penguinrandomhouse.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Penguin Random House\n\n  * About Us\n  * Our Story\n  * Our People\n  * Our Contributors\n  * Locations\n  * Management\n  * Social Impact\n  * Accessibility Statement\n  * Careers\n  * Imprints\n\n  * Quick Links\n  * Partnerships\n  * Media Queries\n  * Influencers\n  * Company Reads\n  * PenguinRandomHouse.biz\n  * Email Preferences\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * CA Privacy Policy\n  * Do Not Sell My Personal Info\n  * Affiliate Program Disclosure\n  * Fraud Alert\n\n  * Help\n  * Publishing Process\n  * FAQ\n  * Shopping & Shipping FAQ\n  * For Educators\n  * Subrights\n  * Permissions\n\nConnect\n\nSign up for news about books, authors, and more from Penguin Random House\n\nAn Inbox Worth Reading\n\nglobal.penguinrandomhouse.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Penguin Random House\n\nVisit other sites in the Penguin Random House Network\n\nBrightly\n\nRaise kids who love to read\n\nToday's Top Books\n\nWant to know what people are actually reading right now?\n\nTASTE\n\nAn online magazine for today\u2019s home cook\n\nAn Inbox Worth Reading\n\n\u00d7\n\nBecome a Member\n\nJust for joining you\u2019ll get personalized recommendations on your dashboard\ndaily and features only for members.\n\nFind Out More Join Now Sign In\n\nHi,\n\nMember Since\n\nAccount Overview Recommendations Orders Account Details Email Preferences\nBookshelf\n\n## Success!\n\nYour account has been created.
