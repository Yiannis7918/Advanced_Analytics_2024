This advantage holds even when\ntaking into account other important factors like race or the attorney\u2019s\nexperience. These findings suggest that, despite efforts to maintain fairness,\njudges might still be swayed by the appearance of attorneys, highlighting an\nunconscious bias that could impact legal outcomes.\n\nThe investigation into the impact of attorney attractiveness on judicial\ndecisions stems from a long-recognized human bias: the \u201cbeauty is good\u201d\nstereotype. A vast body of psychological research has established that\nphysically attractive individuals are often perceived more favorably across\nvarious life domains, from employment and education to social interactions.\nThis advantage is rooted in the halo effect, where positive attributes are\nascribed to people based solely on their appearance.\n\nWhile the impact of attractiveness has been studied in various fields, its\neffect within the judiciary \u2014 a domain where decisions have profound\nimplications for justice and societal norms \u2014 has been less explored.\n\n\u201cI have always been intrigued by questions that have real-world implications\nand are inherently interesting to many people. Physical attractiveness is an\nintuitive topic to study because, to some extent, it resonates with everyone,\nand everyone is capable of making an evaluation of it,\u201d said study author\nNicholas W. Waterbury, the Assistant Research Director for the Center for\nState Policy and Leadership at the University of Illinois, Springfield.\n\n\u201cBut as the paper says, to the extent an outside factor like attractiveness\naffects legal decision-making, it raises significant concerns about the\nfairness of the justice system and the way researchers study judges. I think\nexploring the effect this readily observable trait can have on something as\nsignificant as federal court decisions has been interesting, important, and at\ntimes surprising.\u201d\n\nTo establish a causal link between attorney attractiveness and judicial\ndecision outcomes, the study employed sophisticated matching algorithms to\npair attorneys who were equivalent in all respects except for their level of\nattractiveness. This \u201ctreatment\u201d variable (attractiveness) allowed for the\nisolation of its effect from other confounding variables such as attorney\nexperience, ideological alignment, and financial resources.\n\nWaterbury first compiled a dataset of attorneys who orally argued cases within\nthe United States Courts of Appeals between 2017 and 2019. He chose the Courts\nof Appeals for his study due to the impartial assignment process of cases:\nneither attorneys nor judges have control over the selection process, ensuring\nthat attorneys cannot choose judges likely to favor them, and judges cannot\nchoose their cases based on the attorneys arguing them.\n\nThe researcher then employed four distinct measures of attractiveness to\nassess the impact of attorney appearance on judicial decision-making.\n\nThe first measure relied on survey respondents\u2019 evaluations of attorneys\u2019\nprofessional photos obtained from their websites. Attorneys were rated on a\nscale from 1 to 10, with these scores averaged to represent each attorney\u2019s\nattractiveness.\n\nThe first measure introduced an objective counterpart to human ratings by\nemploying a machine learning algorithm developed by Megvii (Face++ Beauty\nScore). This algorithm analyzed facial features, symmetry, and other elements\nto assign a comparable attractiveness score.\n\nThe third measure was designed to assess how attorneys\u2019 appearances might\ninfluence perceptions in a courtroom setting. It utilized ratings from video\nclips of attorneys during oral arguments before the Ninth Circuit Court of\nAppeals, capturing the dynamic aspects of attractiveness that static images\ncannot convey. This method aimed to mimic the judges\u2019 visual experience as\nclosely as possible.\n\nLastly, the four measure focused on the comparative aspect of attractiveness\nby calculating the score difference between opposing attorneys and U.S.\ngovernment attorneys in the Ninth Circuit. This measure sought to explore the\ncompetitive edge that attractiveness might confer within the specific context\nof a legal case.\n\nAnalyzing over 3,000 judicial votes and 1,000 cases, Waterbury found that\nattorneys perceived as more attractive consistently enjoyed higher success\nrates in securing favorable votes from individual judges and winning cases\noutright, compared to their less attractive counterparts. These findings were\nrobust, holding true across various measures of attractiveness and even when\naccounting for traditional factors known to influence courtroom success, such\nas experience, ideology, and financial resources.\n\n\u201cI consider the main takeaway to be that \u2018judges are people too,'\u201d Waterbury\ntold PsyPost. \u201cWhen judges are overburdened with work they rely on some of the\nsame mental shortcuts (heuristics) the rest of us use to make decisions.\nResearchers have shown in many settings that attractive individuals have\nadvantages over less attractive counterparts. This research suggests that when\njudges need to quickly evaluate an attorney\u2019s argument they extend the same\nattractiveness advantage as everyone else.\u201d\n\nWaterbury not only investigated the general advantage of being perceived as\nmore attractive but also on how this advantage may intersect with the race and\ngender. Female attorneys with higher attractiveness scores appeared to receive\na greater advantage, especially when arguing before male judges. But\notherwise, there was little evidence that race or gender significantly\ninfluenced the attractiveness advantage.\n\n\u201cTo some extent I was surprised that the results were consistent regardless of\nthe race and gender of the judges, attorneys, and survey respondents involved\nin my study,\u201d Waterbury said. \u201cThere was some suggestion in my review of\nprevious research that race and gender effects would impact attractiveness\nratings and thus impact the relationship between attractiveness and success in\ncourt. I did not find strong evidence to support that expectation in my\nanalysis.\u201d\n\nOne of the primary limitations is the study\u2019s focus on the United States\nCourts of Appeals, specifically cases involving the U.S. government as a\nparty. This specific context raises questions about the generalizability of\nthe findings to other judicial settings, such as state courts or different\nlegal systems altogether, where the dynamics of attorney-judge interaction and\ndecision-making processes might differ.\n\n\u201cThe next step in this research agenda is to study the downstream effects of\nthis result,\u201d Waterbury said. \u201cWho are the parties/attorneys most likely to\nbenefit from the attractiveness advantage? Are any individuals or groups\nsystematically more likely to win or lose in court as a result?\u201d\n\nThe study, \u201cJustice Isn\u2019t Blind: Attorney Attractiveness and Success in US\nFederal Court,\u201d was published March 4, 2024.\n\nTweetSendScanShareSendPinShareShareShare\n\n### RELATED\n\nClimate\n\n### New study reveals public\u2019s feelings on climate protest tactics and targets\n\nApril 12, 2024\n\nResearchers have shed light on the perceived appropriateness of climate\nprotest tactics and targets.
