Some writers are good - and they write\nall the time. The holy trinity of newsletter writers (Matt Levine, Byrne\nHobart and Patrick McKenzie) write up to 700k words a year - so 2,000 words a\nday. I think Matt Levine\u2019s schedule looks a little bit like waking up and\ndoing 4000 words early in the morning about three times a week, then hitting\nsend on his newsletter. Marc Rubinstein (another pretty prolific writer!)\nrecently shared this Bloomberg profile of Jason Goldberg - \u201ca Barclays analyst\nwho has been writing a daily briefing note for 20 years\u201d. It\u2019s not just\nnewsletter writers - for instance, Philip Kerr managed to write 42 books in 29\nyears by just working obsessively, writing on birthdays and Christmas. Paul\nErd\u00f6s had an even more insane work schedule:\n\n> \u201cErd\u00f6s first did mathematics at the age of three, but for the last twenty-\n> five years of his life, since the death of his mother, he put in nineteen-\n> hour days, keeping himself fortified with 10 to 20 milligrams of Benzedrine\n> or Ritalin, strong espresso, and caffeine tablets. \"A mathematician,\" Erd\u00f6s\n> was fond of saying, \"is a machine for turning coffee into theorems.\" When\n> friends urged him to slow down, he always had the same response: \"There'll\n> be plenty of time to rest in the grave.\"\n>\n> Erd\u00f6s would let nothing stand in the way of mathematical progress. When the\n> name of a colleague in California came up at breakfast in New Jersey, Erd\u00f6s\n> remembered a mathematical result he wanted to share with him. He headed\n> toward the phone and started to dial. His host interrupted him, pointing out\n> that it was 5:00 A.M. on the West Coast. \"Good,\" Erd\u00f6s said, \"that means\n> he'll be home.\" ... Like all of Erd\u00f6s's friends, Graham was concerned about\n> his drug-taking. In 1979, Graham bet Erd\u00f6s $500 that he couldn't stop taking\n> amphetamines for a month. Erd\u00f6s accepted the challenge, and went cold turkey\n> for thirty days. After Graham paid up--and wrote the $500 off as a business\n> expense--Erd\u00f6s said, \"You've showed me I'm not an addict. But I didn't get\n> any work done. I'd get up in the morning and stare at a blank piece of\n> paper. I'd have no ideas, just like an ordinary person. You've set\n> mathematics back a month.\" He promptly resumed taking pills, and mathematics\n> was the better for it.\n\nLooking at these guys, one feels a bit inadequate. How do they do it? Why\naren\u2019t you doing it? What did you get done this week?\n\nOne answer to this question is Scott Alexander\u2019s essay is The Parable of the\nTalents. In the essay, he\u2019s basically trying to square a circle: to reconcile\nthe ideas that 1. natural talent exists and 2. everyone is morally equivalent.\nAlexander puts a lot of effort into proving point 1, and I think he does a\ngreat job. Here are the relevant sections. I agree with all of this, which is\nwhy I\u2019m not trying to put it into my own words. But I\u2019m particularly\ninterested in his point that talent is a real thing, and some people are just\nbetter at things than others. He takes this really seriously.\n\n> \u201cConsider for a moment Srinivasa Ramanujan, one of the greatest\n> mathematicians of all time. He grew up in poverty in a one-room house in\n> small-town India. He taught himself mathematics by borrowing books from\n> local college students and working through the problems on his own until he\n> reached the end of the solveable ones and had nowhere else to go but\n> inventing ways to solve the unsolveable ones.\n>\n> There are a lot of poor people in the United States today whose life\n> circumstances prevented their parents from reading books to them as a child,\n> prevented them from getting into the best schools, prevented them from\n> attending college, et cetera. And pretty much all of those people still got\n> more educational opportunities than Ramanujan did.\n>\n> And from there we can go in one of two directions. First, we can say that a\n> lot of intelligence is innate, that Ramanujan was a genius, and that we\n> mortals cannot be expected to replicate his accomplishments.\n>\n> Or second, we can say those poor people are just not trying hard enough.\n>\n> ... In high school English, I got A++s in all my classes, Principal\u2019s Gold\n> Medals, 100%s on tests, first prize in various state-wide essay contests,\n> etc. In Math, I just barely by the skin of my teeth scraped together a pass\n> in Calculus with a C-.\n>\n> Every time I won some kind of prize in English my parents would praise me\n> and say I was good and should feel good. My teachers would hold me up as an\n> example and say other kids should try to be more like me. Meanwhile, when I\n> would bring home a report card with a C- in math, my parents would have\n> concerned faces and tell me they were disappointed and I wasn\u2019t living up to\n> my potential and I needed to work harder et cetera.\n>\n> And I don\u2019t know which part bothered me more.\n>\n> Every time I was held up as an example in English class, I wanted to crawl\n> under a rock and die. I didn\u2019t do it! I didn\u2019t study at all, half the time I\n> did the homework in the car on the way to school, those essays for the\n> statewide competition were thrown together on a lark without a trace of real\n> effort. To praise me for any of it seemed and still seems utterly unjust.\n>\n> On the other hand, to this day I believe I deserve a fricking statue for\n> getting a C- in Calculus I. It should be in the center of the schoolyard,\n> and have a plaque saying something like \u201cScott Alexander, who by making a\n> herculean effort managed to pass Calculus I, even though they kept throwing\n> random things after the little curly S sign and pretending it made sense.\u201d\n>\n> And without some notion of innate ability, I don\u2019t know what to do with this\n> experience. I don\u2019t want to have to accept the blame for being a lazy person\n> who just didn\u2019t try hard enough in Math. But I really don\u2019t want to have to\n> accept the credit for being a virtuous and studious English student who\n> worked harder than his peers. ...\n>\n> When I was 6 and my brother was 4, our mom decided that as an Overachieving\n> Jewish Mother she was contractually obligated to make both of us learn to\n> play piano. She enrolled me in a Yamaha introductory piano class, and my\n> younger brother in a Yamaha \u2018cute little kids bang on the keyboard\u2019 class.\n>\n> A little while later, I noticed that my brother was now with me in my\n> Introductory Piano class.\n>\n> A little while later, I noticed that my brother was now by far the best\n> student in my Introductory Piano Class, even though he had just started and\n> was two or three years younger than anyone else there.\n>\n> A little while later, Yamaha USA flew him to Japan to show him off before\n> the Yamaha corporate honchos there.\n>\n> Well, one thing led to another, and my brother won several international\n> piano competitions, got a professorship in music at age 25, and now\n> routinely gets news articles written about him calling him \u201camong the top\n> musicians of his generation\u201d.\n>\n> Meanwhile, I was always a mediocre student at Yamaha. When the time came to\n> try an instrument in elementary school, I went with the violin to see if\n> maybe I\u2019d find it more to my tastes than the piano. I was quickly sorted\n> into the remedial class because I couldn\u2019t figure out how to make my\n> instrument stop sounding like a wounded cat. After a year or so of this, I\n> decided to switch to fulfilling my music requirement through a choir, and\n> everyone who\u2019d had to listen to me breathed a sigh of relief.\n>\n> Every so often I wonder if somewhere deep inside me there is the potential\n> to be \u201camong the top musicians of my generation.\u201d I try to recollect whether\n> my brother practiced harder than I did. My memories are hazy, but I don\u2019t\n> think he practiced much harder until well after his career as a child\n> prodigy had taken off.\n>\n> ...\n>\n> I dunno. But I don\u2019t think of myself as working hard at any of the things I\n> am good at, in the sense of \u201cexerting vast willpower to force myself kicking\n> and screaming to do them\u201d. It\u2019s possible I do work hard, and that an outside\n> observer would accuse me of eliding how hard I work, but it\u2019s not a\n> conscious elision and I don\u2019t feel that way from the inside.\n>\n> ...\n>\n> But I still feel like there\u2019s something going on here where the solution to\n> me being bad at math and piano isn\u2019t just \u201csweat blood and push through your\n> brain\u2019s aversion to these subjects until you make it stick\u201d. When I read\n> biographies of Ramanujan and other famous mathematicians, there\u2019s no sense\n> that they ever had to do that with math. When I talk to my brother, I never\n> get a sense that he had to do that with piano. And if I am good enough at\n> writing to qualify to have an opinion on being good at things, then I don\u2019t\n> feel like I ever went through that process myself.\n>\n> So this too is part of my deal with myself. I\u2019ll try to do my best at\n> things, but if there\u2019s something I really hate, something where I have to go\n> uphill every step of the way, then it\u2019s okay to admit mediocrity. I won\u2019t\n> beat myself up for not forcing myself kicking and screaming to practice\n> piano. And in return I won\u2019t become too cocky about practicing writing a\n> lot.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a related piece - his Apologia pro vita sua.\n\n> \u201cI have had a really busy few months. I think it will be letting up soon,\n> but I\u2019m not sure. And I\u2019ve told a lot of people who needed things from me,\n> for one reason or another, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m too busy to take care of this\n> right now.\u201d\n>\n> And I worry that some of those people read my blog and think \u201cWait, if you\n> have enough time to write blog posts nearly every day, some of which are up\n> to six thousand words long, why don\u2019t you have enough time to do a couple of\n> hours work for me?\u201d\n>\n> And the answer is \u2013 you fancy doctors with your mathematics and subtraction\n> might say that I could just take a couple of hours away from blogging and\n> use those free hours to write that one thing or analyze that one study or\n> whatever, but you\u2019re not going to fool me.\n>\n> Just as drugs mysteriously find their own non-fungible money, enjoyable\n> activities mysteriously find their own non-fungible time. If I had to\n> explain it, I\u2019d say the resource bottleneck isn\u2019t time but energy/willpower,\n> and that these look similar because working hard saps energy/willpower and\n> relaxing for a while restores it, so when I have less time I also have less\n> energy/willpower. But some things don\u2019t require energy/willpower and so are\n> essentially free. Writing this is my addiction, so it\u2019s free. Doesn\u2019t mean\n> anything else is.\u201d\n\nErd\u00f6s\u2019s genius, then, was that his 19 hour workdays were \u201cessentially free\u201d.\nHe didn\u2019t sweat blood and push though his brain\u2019s aversion to doing maths - it\nmust have come pretty naturally to him. So it\u2019s really important to do things\nthat come naturally to you.\n\nHere\u2019s Jim Donovan talking about his SLA with clients while working as an\ninvestment banker:\n\n> \u201cWhen I started at Goldman Sachs ... I would say to clients, you can leave\n> me a voicemail, any time, unless I\u2019m dead or asleep, I check it every ten\n> seconds... And I don\u2019t sleep very long either.\u201d\n\nI suspect that for Donovan, this didn\u2019t feel like sweating blood - it was just\nhow he was wired. Some people (not me!) are slow repliers, some people hate\nalways being available, and those people are going to be terrible investment\nbankers and Jim Donovan is going to take their clients. Because for him, this\nstuff came naturally. He\u2019s a 99.999th percentile voicemail replier. He was\nborn to do it - and what\u2019s awesome is that he found a way to turn his natural\ntalent into loads of money.\n\nI know professional writers that hear about Matt Levine and Scott Alexander\u2019s\nwork routine, and shake their heads. They produce a book every few years; they\nneed to waste a few hours to get in the mindset to do anything. The can\u2019t just\njot down a paragraph here and there in their breaks. And yet even though they\ncan\u2019t hold themselves to that standard, they\u2019re still professional writers. I\nmean, look how Hunter S. Thompson lived (yes, I know it\u2019s not real):\n\nMy writing process doesn\u2019t look much like Levine\u2019s. I don\u2019t have his\nconsistency. The general pattern is that I spend weeks or months stewing on\nsomething, and then take a few hours and write it all down in one go, with\nminimal editing. That\u2019s in contrast to a friend who told me recently that he\nspent two years writing 52 essays - one every two weeks, with metronomic\nconsistency.\n\nHere\u2019s an example from my finals. I had a coursework essay due at 12pm, and\nthe night before, I went for dinner with my two best friends. At about 5am I\nhad maybe the introduction written - and I felt my life flashing before my\neyes. Was this going to be the moment I failed my finals? But because I\u2019d\nspent six months thinking about the question on and off, over the next few\nhours I managed to write 2,000 words on the subject of \u201cOnly God, not Man,\nmakes an heir\u201d: to what extent did Henry II\u2019s legal reforms strengthen God\u2019s\nhand?\u201d, and got a 78 for my troubles - my best mark across all my papers.\n\nHonestly, that was super fun - it wasn\u2019t a sustainable or consistent way to\nget work done, but I enjoyed the pressure, I enjoyed the challenge, and I\ndefinitely enjoyed the 78. Writing seems to come to me in these spurts, which\nimplies that I\u2019m going to struggle to work with the consistency that Matt\nLevine achieves; ergo, I should not become a professional newsletter writer.\n\nIf you read enough finance books you start to pick up anecdotes about what\nmakes a good trader. Lots of my friends are traders - there\u2019s an archetype of\n\u201cBritish Indian, studied economics at Cambridge, grew up in northwest London\u201d\nthat seems particularly successful - and so I\u2019ve had feedback on these ideas.\nThese guys say that they see themselves in these quotes.\n\nOne useful trait is an extreme ability for self-control and rational thinking\nunder pressure:\n\n> \"Bill [Gross] was to a large extent a trend follower, but he had a unique\n> ability to know when it was time to lean against that trend and take a\n> contrary position. There were numerous occasions where everyone else was\n> scared shitless, and Bill put on his seat belt.\"\n>\n> Pimco partner Ben Trosky, quoted in The Bond King\n>\n> \"When the financial stakes were high, though, [Steve] Cohen demonstrated an\n> almost inhuman ability to stay calm and make rational trading decisions. ...\n> It was practically a genetic anomaly, this ability to behave like a reptile\n> when he was trading, as opposed to a human being prone to fear and self-\n> doubt. When he interviewed new hires he tried to test for this quality as\n> best he could.\"\n>\n> Sheelah Kolhatkar, Black Edge\n\nAnother is being inscrutable. For example, people talked about John Meriwether\nfrom LTCM like this:\n\n> \u201cJohn has a steel-trap mind. You have no clue what he's thinking.\u201d\n>\n> William McIntosh (who hired Meriwether into Salomon Brothers), quoted in\n> When Genius Failed\n>\n> \u201cHe wore the same blank half-tense expression when he won as he did when he\n> lost. He had, I think, a profound ability to control the two emotions that\n> commonly destroy traders - fear and greed - and it made him as noble as a\n> man who pursues his own interest so fiercely can be.\"\n>\n> Michael Lewis, writing about Meriwether\u2019s time at Salomon in Liar\u2019s Poker\n\nMostly, though, the key is to be an obsessive:\n\n> \u201cMy interview with the company - that is, with [Thomas] Peterffy - was\n> memorable. It took place it his apartment in Greenwich, where his butler\n> (his butler!) served us drinks. I made an offhand joke about programming,\n> and he chided me for not having respect for the practice. He told me: 'To be\n> successful in this business, you have to think about it all the time. Lots\n> of people in this business are very smart, but not everyone can think about\n> it all the time.' These words - you have to think about it all the time -\n> made a deep impression on me. Peterffy's phrase has pretty much become my\n> motto - at least, it's one of them. At the time, I was struck by how simple\n> and obvious it was. In fact, it was exactly what I did when I was faced with\n> a complex programming challenge.\u201d\n>\n> Igor Tulchinsky, talking about how he came to work at Timber Hill (a\n> Connecticut prop trading firm) in The Unrules\n>\n> \"Intentionally isolated, he said, 'a quiet oasis of serenity.'\n>\n> Serene for him, maybe, but his personality mangled whatever peace the rest\n> of them could have enjoyed. The place was suffused with Gross's clinical\n> insecurity that someone might catch up, that someone might threaten Pimco's\n> dominance.\n>\n> No moment wasted, no dollar left unsqueezed. This was the dominant culture,\n> trickled down from the trade floor: Gross's 'Pimbots' ground their teeth in\n> their sleep and woke up screaming: their marriages and livers disintegrated.\n> It was precisely that they were so intensely obsessive, going beyond what\n> everyone else did, that made them so great, they had to convince\n> themselves...\n>\n> Failure to deliver wasn't tolerated. Pimco would sniff out anyone's\n> weakness.\"\n>\n> Mary Childs discussing Bill Gross\u2019s decision to locate Pimco in Newport\n> Beach, in The Bond King\n\nAnd finally, a quote that hits the nail on the head - even though it doesn\u2019t\ncome from a trader:\n\n> \"A man has to live and sleep with his business if he wants to make a go of\n> it. You have to take it home with you at night, so you can lie there in the\n> darkness and figure out what you can do to improve it. In fact, you have to\n> become sort of a 'nut' about it, so that you become so enthused that you\n> will bore your friends talking about it. You have to be a one-man crusade.\"\n>\n> George Mecherle\u2019s answer to the question, \u201cwhat is the secret of your\n> success?\u201d, in The Farmer from Merna\n\nNassim Taleb once said, \"unless you're a trader, don't trade. Unless you're a\nbaker, don't bake. Unless you're a dynamite maker, don't make dynamite.\" I\nthink unless you can see yourself in at least some of those quotes, you\nprobably shouldn\u2019t be a trader.\n\nI once spent a huge amount of effort on something in which I had zero natural\ntalent.\n\nI started playing rugby at seven years old. I was always pretty useless, but I\nalways tried really hard. I remember deciding age 12 that I wanted to be\nbetter, so one day, at my (boarding) prep school, I woke up early, got a\ntackle bag, and started doing tackle practice - on my own, at 7am. A teacher\nwalked by, and said \u2018what are you doing?\u2019 Slightly sheepishly, I packed up the\nbag and went back inside. I didn\u2019t get picked to go on the rugby tour, and\nnever played for the U13 A team. When I went to secondary school, I was,\nagain, rubbish - I think at one point I played for the U14 D team. And then,\nin October 2014, Bath, my favourite rugby union team, signed Sam Burgess: the\nYorkshire-born Australian rugby league star. I watched his documentary on\nYouTube, and it changed my life. The Russell Crowe narration at the start made\na huge impression on me:\n\n> \u201cNow I have this theory about a certain kind of player. Like a Ron Coote, a\n> Steve Menzies, a Gorden Tallis. I call it the Sparkly-Eyed Man. He\u2019s a man\n> who can be as vicious as he needs to be over the course of eighty minutes to\n> get a result for his team. And the moment that final whistle is blown he\u2019s a\n> completely different person. He\u2019s able to laugh easily, he\u2019s good with kids,\n> respectful to women, and he appreciates life. Which is why he\u2019s the Sparkly-\n> Eyed Man. He has that thing built within him to never quit, and if you\u2019re\n> going to do something, you do it to the absolute utmost of your ability.\n> Those sparkly-eyed men, they carve their names deep in Rugby League.\u201d\n\nSam Burgess won the 2014 NRL Grand Final with South Sydney, just before he\nleft for Bath. He broke his cheekbone in the opening tackle of the game, was\nman of the match, and won the Bunnies their first premiership in 43 years.\n\nThis blew my mind. I wanted to be that guy. As a teenager, I absorbed all the\nsports motivational videos on YouTube. I watched this one, I watched this one,\nand this one above all. This stuff is burned into the back of my skull. I\nwatched these things over and over again. I tried to figure out how to set\nthem as an alarm.\n\n> \u201cWhen you immerse yourself in your craft, you not studying to get a grade,\n> you\u2019re not playing to score points, you immerse yourself in it, so you\n> become it, you gon\u2019 go to another level. The most important thing is this:\n> to be able to sacrifice yourself at any moment, to sacrifice what you are,\n> for what you are. Listen to me. Pain is temporary. It may last for a minute,\n> or an hour, or a day, or even a year, but eventually it will subside. And\n> something else will take its place. You ain\u2019t gon\u2019 die. At the end of pain\n> is success! You\u2019re not gon\u2019 die because you\u2019re feeling a little pain! I dare\n> you to take a little pain. I dare you.\n>\n> Your life is in your hand. You are the captain of your ship. You could have,\n> you could be, you could do whatever you want to do, remember boy, if it was\n> easy, everybody would do it. It\u2019s what they eat, it\u2019s what they sleep, it\u2019s\n> what they drink, it possesses them.\u201d\n\nSo I decided I was going to play for the school first XV. I had about two and\na half years to get ready. Let\u2019s be honest, there wasn\u2019t that much pain\ninvolved in that process - not like the pain Ray Lewis, who\u2019s quoted in the\nspeech above, had growing up. But this was the most difficult a quest I could\nfind. A lot of people told me I couldn\u2019t do it - my tutor, the U16A coach,\ntold me I\u2019d never play for the first XV.\n\nI ate so much food I vomited. I drank a gallon of milk a day. I did squats\nuntil my nose bled. Here\u2019s me, age 16, pulling 180 at Villain Strength in Mill\nHill; and age 17, squatting 140x5 in my South Sydney jersey.\n\nAnd ultimately, it worked. I played a few games for the XV. I proved the\ndoubters wrong. I achieved my goal. And I was still actually pretty useless at\nrugby.\n\nI knew what it felt like to be effortlessly good at something, because I had\nthat academically; when it came to maths tests, spelling bees, quizzes - I\njust had it. \u201cDo you know how easy this is for me? Do you have any fucking\nidea how easy this is? This is a fucking joke! And I'm sorry you can't do\nthis, I really am because I wouldn't have to fucking sit here and watch you\nfumble around and fuck it up.\u201d In the classroom, I was Will Hunting; on the\nrugby pitch, I fumbled around and fucked it up.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter that I\u2019d spent three years getting bigger and stronger and\nfitter and faster - I still wasn\u2019t anywhere near the level of the players with\nactual talent. They could see the game, they knew how to be in the right place\nat the right time, they could throw the final pass - and I had spent enough\ntime trying to be like that that I knew I never could. I spent 8 years at\nschool with a guy who\u2019s probably going to be an Olympic hurdler this year; he\nhad talent. And so it didn\u2019t matter how many Tri-Nations games I watched or\nhow many pushups I did, because I\u2019d never get it like they did. I had worked\nas hard as I could, and it wasn\u2019t ever going to be good enough.\n\nThat was my Scott Alexander sweating blood experience. I learned what it felt\nlike to stick with something. But my learning from that experience was that\nnext time I should make sure I sweated blood working on a strength. Do more of\nwhat comes naturally.\n\nI\u2019ve spent the last few years trying to figure out what that is. I studied\nlinear algebra, I read Marsilius of Padua, I wrote essays, I wrote SQL, I\nmanaged ad campaigns, I travelled the world selling software, I hired and\nfired a team, I tried to respond to messages in 10 seconds, I networked my way\ninto industries and learned what makes them tick, and I raised some venture\ncapital. Some of that felt natural; some of it didn\u2019t. I\u2019m still looking for\nwhat comes next.\n\nI was in LA last week, on a mission to meet great people. The best person I\nmet was the World\u2019s Strongest Man, Martins Licis, at his gym in El Segundo. It\nwas a complete accident; I didn\u2019t know he was there, and I didn\u2019t expect to\nwork out that day. But the reason I was able to walk in and learn strongman\nfrom the best in the world was all those hours spent under a bar, squatting\nuntil my nose bled.\n\nSo I guess it\u2019s ok to bake bread even if you\u2019re not a baker - we\u2019re all\nallowed hobbies. Just don\u2019t make it your full-time job.\n\nFelix Stocker\n\nNext\n\nNext\n\n## The Megazord; or, the Tony Blair Institute\n\n", "frontpage": false}
