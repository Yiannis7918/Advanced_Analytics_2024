There are no federal\nheat regulations.\n\nChandan Khanna/AFP via Getty Images\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis has signed a law that prevents cities or counties\nfrom creating protections for workers who labor in the state's often extreme\nand dangerous heat.\n\nTwo million people in Florida, from construction to agriculture, work outside\nin often humid, blazing heat.\n\nFor years, many of them have asked for rules to protect them from heat: paid\nrest breaks, water, and access to shade when temperatures soar. After years of\nnegotiations, such rules were on the agenda in Miami-Dade County, home to an\nestimated 300,000 outdoor workers.\n\nBut the new law, signed Thursday evening, blocks such protections from being\nimplemented in cities and counties across the state.\n\nMiami-Dade pulled its local heat protection rule from consideration after the\nstatewide bill passed the legislature in March.\n\n\"It's outrageous that the state legislature will override the elected\nofficials of Miami Dade or other counties that really recognize the importance\nof protecting that community of workers,\" says David Michaels, an\nepidemiologist at George Washington University and a former administrator at\nthe federal Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA).\n\nThe loss of the local rule was a major blow to Miami-Dade activists and\nworkers who had hoped the county heat protection rules would be in place\nbefore summer.\n\nIn a press conference on Friday, DeSantis said the bill he signed did not come\nfrom him. \"There was a lot of concern out of one county, Miami-Dade. And I\ndon't think it was an issue in any other part of the state,\" DeSantis said. \"I\nthink they were pursuing something that was going to cause a lot of problems\ndown there.\"\n\nBut extreme heat will only get worse. \"Last year was the hottest summer in\nFlorida's history. And this year will likely be the hottest summer in\nFlorida's history,\" says Esteban Wood, director of the advocacy group We-\nCount, one of the organizations working on heat protections in Miami-Dade. The\nnew law, he says, represents \"a profound loss for not only the campaign but\nfor all the families that have for many years been fighting for the\nminimum\u2014which was just water, shade and rest, and the right to return home\nafter work alive.\"\n\nLupe Gonzalo knows this reality well. She used to pick tomatoes in Florida\nduring the summer and she'd find herself woozy from the heat. Sometimes she'd\ncramp up or get piercing headaches. Gonzalo shoved bottles of water into every\npocket, but even that wasn't nearly enough to get her through the day. Some\ncolleagues, she says, went to the hospital with heat exhaustion\u2014and some even\ndied.\n\n\"Without water, without rests, without shade, the body of a worker\u2014it resents\nit,\" Gonzalo says in Spanish.\n\nThe heat has already caused problems this spring. Samuel Nava, a landscaper\nfrom Homestead, Florida, says in March his coworker collapsed with heat-\ninduced cramps. Nava helped him get to the emergency room.\n\nNava says he's used to the heat working for months on end in high humidity,\nhis clothes drenched in sweat.\n\n\"Es como una sauna,\" he says\u2014it's like a sauna.\n\n### Patchy national protections against heat\n\nHeat risks have grown dramatically in recent years. Globally, since the 1980s,\nclimate change has made heat waves last longer. They come more frequently and\naffect bigger areas. The worst heat waves are several degrees hotter now than\nthey would have been without human-caused climate change.\n\nThe U.S. experienced its hottest-ever summer in 2023, and Florida recorded its\nhottest-ever July and August. The heat index, a measure that incorporates both\ntemperature and humidity, stayed above 100 degrees Fahrenheit for 46 days in a\nrow in Miami.\n\nConstruction workers often labor under dangerously hot, humid conditions in\nFlorida, like during 2023's July heat wave. Heat records broke across the\nstate during 2023's summer.

Heat records broke across the\nstate during 2023's summer.\n\nEva Marie Uzcategui/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nDespite the increasing risks, there are no federal rules regulating when it's\ntoo hot to work, even though thousands of heat-related injuries and dozens of\ndeaths are reported across the U.S. every year. There is a federal requirement\nthat employers keep workers safe on the job, and recommendations for how to do\nso, including protecting workers from extreme heat. But the guidance doesn't\nsay exactly what those protections are or what to do when limits are\nsurpassed.\n\nA handful of states or local jurisdictions like Miami-Dade have attempted to\ncreate some protections. Some have succeeded, but more have stalled or failed.\n\nCalifornia was the first to establish regulations in 2006. They require\nemployers to provide shade, rest breaks, and access to cool, clean water for\noutdoor workers. After the rules were implemented, heat-related workers\ncompensation claims dropped, according to a 2021 study from UCLA.\n\nMore recently, after several farm workers died in the deadly June heat wave in\nthe Pacific Northwest in 2021, Washington and Oregon created worker\nprotections from heat.\n\nPolitical headwinds have blocked other efforts. Proposals in state\nlegislatures including Virginia and Nevada failed. In Texas, Austin and Dallas\ncreated ordinances that required employers to provide paid water breaks to\noutdoor workers. But last year Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed a \"preemption\"\nlaw that blocked local jurisdictions from making such rules. The goal,\nAbbott's office said, was to prevent a \"patchwork\" of differing local rules,\nwhich they contended would cause confusion for businesses in the state.\n\nFlorida's new law is similar to the one passed in Texas, though it is more\nnarrowly focused on preventing heat protections. Lobbyists cited similar\nconcerns to Texas, saying they wanted clarity and consistency statewide.\n\n\"Predictability and certainty is what we look for,\" says Carol Bowen, chief\nlobbyist for the Associated Builders and Contractors of Florida, an industry\ngroup. \"You want a set of consistent guidelines so you know the road map.\"\nRight now, she says, the federal recommendations provide a clear-enough\noutline.\n\nBut Shefali Milczarek-Desai, a labor law expert at the University of Arizona,\nsays \"If the legislature is really concerned about having a patchwork of heat\nstandards, then why doesn't the legislature itself pass a heat standard\nregulation?\" Proposed heat legislation has come up before the Florida\nlegislature several times in recent years but it has not moved forward.\n\nOSHA began working on national rules targeting heat in 2021, but the process\ncould take years. Creating a new OSHA rule takes on average seven years from\nstart to implementation, according to the Governmental Accountability Office.\n\nIn the meantime, the state-by-state patchwork of rules leaves tens of millions\nof workers at risk, says Michaels. \"We need a solution that protects all\nworkers, and that's what the federal standard will do,\" he says.\n\n### High heat risks in Florida\n\nNationally, the Bureau of Labor Statistics recorded 436 heat-related worker\ndeaths between 2011 and 2021. The true number is likely much higher, says\nJuley Fulcher, a policy expert at Public Citizen, an organization focused on\nworker health and safety. Public Citizen estimates 2,000 workers die, and more\nthan 100,000 are injured, from heat-related issues each year.\n\nThe discrepancy could come from counting technicalities. Only injuries or\ndeaths that can be directly linked to heat usually get recorded in official\nstatistics\u2014when someone passes out from heatstroke, for example, and falls off\na ladder. But heat can affect people in less obvious ways that still lead to\ninjury or death. Heat draws blood away from the brain, affecting people's\nability to think clearly. That can lead to clumsiness or dangerous mistakes.\n\nHeat also puts extra stress on the body, increasing the chance of other health\nproblems developing. Medical providers are seeing people with kidney problems\nfrom heat exposure, or strokes, or \"because their heart symptoms are worse\nafter people experienced extreme conditions in their homes if they couldn't\nrun air conditioning,\" says Shauna Junco, an infectious disease pharmacist and\nboard member of Florida Clinicians for Climate Action.\n\nAbsent federal rules protecting workers from heat, a few states like\nCalifornia, Oregon, and Washington have made their own. Others like Texas and\nnow Florida have blocked local attempts to create protective rules.\nChameleonseye/Getty Images hide caption\n\ntoggle caption\n\nChameleonseye/Getty Images\n\nAbsent federal rules protecting workers from heat, a few states like\nCalifornia, Oregon, and Washington have made their own. Others like Texas and\nnow Florida have blocked local attempts to create protective rules.\n\nChameleonseye/Getty Images\n\nIn a 2020 study, climate scientist Michelle Tigchellar and her colleagues\nlooked at the heat risks to agricultural workers across the country. Under\ngood working conditions\u2014with regular breaks, shade, and water access\u2014most\nworkers, they found, can stay relatively safe up to a heat index of about 83\ndegrees Fahrenheit. The risks build quickly beyond that threshold. In one\nFlorida county, they analyzed, working conditions are already hotter than that\nfor 113 days out of the year. That number could rise to 148 days if global\ntemperatures rise further.\n\n\"In places like Florida where there's a lot of humid heat, the entire growing\nseason will be unsafe to work,\" Tigchelaar says.\n\n### Florida does see risks for some people\n\nMany people in Florida recognize the dangers of heat.\n\nIn 2020, after the heat-related death of 16-year-old football player Zachary\nMartin-Polsenberg in 2017, Florida lawmakers unanimously passed a law\nrequiring schools to protect student-athletes from heat illness.\n\n\"In the same way high-school athletes should be protected, outdoor workers\nshould too,\" says Esteban Wood from We-Count.\n\nBut heat protections for workers will take time.\n\nMeanwhile, this summer's heat is projected to be another hot one in a string\nof record-breaking years. Wood is already worried about how bad things could\nget in the coming months. He and his colleagues are trying to figure out what\nthey can do to help people stay safe in the continued absence of stricter\nrules protecting them.\n\nOne strategy, says Lupe Gonzalo, is to find alternative solutions while the\npolicy-making slowly moves. She and her colleagues at the Coalition of\nImmokalee Workers, a farmworker organization based in south Florida, have\ndeveloped a community-led effort called the Fair Food Program.\n\nTheir organization has agreements with major food brands like Walmart and\nChipotle\u2014enormous buyers of the fresh produce their workers pick and prepare.\nThe buyers require the agricultural growers to provide safe working\nconditions, including water, shade, and rest breaks on a schedule dictated by\nheat conditions. So far, the program has been working effectively, Gonzalo\nsays\u2014doing what the state has not.\n\nJessica Meszaros with member station WUSF contributed to this story.\n\n##### Correction April 12, 2024\n\nAn earlier version of this story misspelled the last name of Florida Governor\nRon DeSantis.
