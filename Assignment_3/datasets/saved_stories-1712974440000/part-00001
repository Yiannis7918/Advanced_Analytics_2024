The title,\nMohs Hardness Scale is accompanied with the National Park Service arrowhead\nsymbol. The minerals are listed from hardest to softest with their hardness\nscale number as follows: Diamond, 10; Corundum, 9; Topaz, 8; Quartz, 7;\nOrthoclase, 6; Apatite, 5; Flourite, 4; Calcite, 3; Gypsum, 2; and Talc, 1.\nThe Common Objects for hardness comparisons are listed a column to the left\nas: Masonry Drill Bit, 8.5; Steel Nail, 6.5; Knife/Glass Plate, 5.5; Copper\nPenny, 3.5; and Fingernail, 2.5.\n\nNPS illustration by Heather Walborn, Guest Scientist (2013-2014), NPS Geologic\nResources Division.\n\nThe Mohs Hardness Scale is used as a convenient way to help identify minerals.\nA mineral's hardness is a measure of its relative resistance to scratching,\nmeasured by scratching the mineral against another substance of known hardness\non the Mohs Hardness Scale. This graphic outlines the index minerals and some\ncommon objects that are used to determine a mineral's hardness.\n\nThis method is especially useful for identifying minerals in the field because\nyou can test minerals against some very common objects (fingernail, a penny, a\nnail). The scale is named for its creator, the German geologist and\nmineralogist Friedrich Mohs. However, the method of comparing hardness has\nbeen used as far back as 300 BC, as mentioned by Theophrastus in his treatis\nOn Stones.\n\n#### Related Links\n\nNPS\u2014Geoscience Concepts\n\nGeology\n\nRocks and Minerals\n\nPart of a series of articles titled Fundamental Geologic Principles.\n\nPrevious: Geologic Principles\u2014Uniformitarianism\n\n## You Might Also Like\n\n### Junior Ranger: Rock Scavenger Hunt\n\nArticle\n\n### Series: Geology & Minerals\u2014Resource Laws, Regulations, and Policies\n\nArticle\n\n### Lepidodendron Fossil\n\nArticle\n\n### Giant Logs Trail Stop #1\n\nPlace\n\n### Coastal Sediments\u2014Material Size\n\nArticle\n\n### National Capital Area Natural History - Geology\n\nArticle\n\nLoading results...\n\n## Tags\n\n  * minerals\n  * geology\n\nLast updated: April 12, 2023\n\n### Success\n\nThank you.
