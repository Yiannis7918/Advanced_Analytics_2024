Those who dare to move day or night under the prying eyes of enemy\ndrones \u201care dead immediately,\u201d he said.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nCheap drones deployed in Ukraine have transformed modern warfare \u2014 and\ninitially gave Ukrainian troops an advantage on a battlefield where they are\nperpetually outnumbered and outgunned. \u201cThis is the evolution of our\nsurvival,\u201d Nastenko said.\n\nBut the Russians quickly caught on and began mass producing their own drones.\n\nWhat followed was an overabundance of disposable, deadly drones and electronic\nwarfare devices known as jammers that disrupt their flights. Most common are\nfirst-person-view, or FPV drones, typically controlled by a pilot wearing a\nheadset and holding a remote controller.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re witnessing right now is blitzkrieg drone warfare,\u201d said Andrew\nCot\u00e9, chief of staff at BRINC Drones, a Seattle-based drone company sending\nequipment to Ukraine. Cot\u00e9 said that drones in Ukraine are as game changing as\ntanks were in World War I. \u201cIt is pretty stalemate,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause if you\nare out in the open, you will be hunted.\u201d\n\nThe technological advances probably have saved lives because drone pilots can\nwork slightly farther from the zero \u2014 or contact \u2014 line than traditional\ninfantry. But the saturation of drones, many with thermal cameras that work at\nnight, has also shrunk the space where troops can move safely without being\nspotted \u2014 leading to high casualties and, in recent months, largely preventing\neither side from making major breakthroughs.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThese conditions \u2014 combined with widespread minefields and shortages of\nammunition and soldiers \u2014 now make it virtually impossible for Ukraine to\nretake swaths of territory as it did in 2022.\n\nRussia, which has ample missile stocks and superior aviation power,\ncapitalized on Ukraine\u2019s ammunition shortages to seize the strategic eastern\ntown of Avdiivka, and is now pushing to take more land. On Saturday, Ukraine\u2019s\ncommander in chief Oleksandr Syrsky warned that the situation on the eastern\nfront had \u201csignificantly deteriorated.\u201d\n\nUkraine will rely largely on drones to make it difficult for the Russians to\npress forward without putting expensive Russian fighting vehicles at risk\nwhenever they move.\n\nWith large-scale drone production underway in Russia, Ukraine is racing to\nmanufacture more than a million drones this year in hopes that it will prevent\nfurther Russian gains.\n\nThat task is turning even more urgent as Kyiv rapidly runs out of artillery\nand air defense ammunition from its Western partners, including the United\nStates. For months, Republicans in Congress have blocked a $60 billion aid\npackage proposed by President Biden.\n\nMykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine\u2019s minister of digital transformation who is\noverseeing much of the country\u2019s drone development, said Ukrainian drones have\nproved more accurate than artillery on some enemy targets. Still, artillery is\na top need.\n\nEarlier in Russia\u2019s invasion, Ukrainian troops relied on artillery to destroy\nhigh-value targets such as Russian tanks and halt the Russian advance. Now, a\nsevere shortage of 155-mm shells means that even if surveillance drones\nidentify dozens of targets, few will be attacked.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t get enough ammunition we will lose this war,\u201d said Denys, 31, a\ndrone commander in Ukraine\u2019s 45th brigade who conducts surveillance deep\ninside Russian-controlled territory, and who is being identified only by his\nfirst name for security reasons.\n\nIn the meantime, \u201cwe are holding off their advance with FPV drones,\u201d said\nNepal, 32, a drone operator in the same brigade who, like others in this\narticle, spoke on the condition he be identified only by his call sign, in\nkeeping with military rules.\n\nUkraine has trained tens of thousands of soldiers like Nepal as drone pilots \u2014\na role that effectively did not exist when Russia invaded Crimea in 2014. In\nFebruary, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky formalized the role of drone\noperators, establishing a new military branch called the Unmanned Systems\nForces. \u201cRepelling ground assaults is primarily the task of drones,\u201d Zelensky\nsaid, acknowledging that the role of infantry soldiers has changed\ndramatically.\n\nUkrainian factories are producing a wide range of drone models, including ones\nthat strike inside of Russia, and civilian volunteers are building FPVs\nthemselves, following directions on YouTube.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nDemand for drones is outpacing supply, Fedorov said. \u201cEven if we meet all the\nneeds that are formally there now ... tomorrow there will be 10 more attack\ndrone companies that also need drones,\u201d he said.\n\nThe sheer number of drones means the battlefield is \u201calmost transparent on\nboth sides,\u201d Nepal said, speaking from a makeshift base near the front line\nfilled with parts for FPVs.\n\nThe devices, while fairly cheap to construct, are so strategically valuable\nthat Nepal spends hours at his desk working to repair those seized from the\nRussians or fixing their own in hopes they can be used again.\n\nJamming systems, which disrupt drone frequencies and turn pilots\u2019 screens to\nstatic, have made missions even more difficult. Sometimes, Nepal said, he must\nhit his targets \u201cbeing almost blind.\u201d\n\nThere is little besides jamming the signal that troops can do to protect\nthemselves from a drone. Nepal often watches as Russian troops, holding\nassault rifles, try to save their lives by shooting down his explosive-laden\ndrones before they crash into them.\n\nNepal\u2019s commander, Fox, 32, said nonstop flights of Russian drones mean\n\u201ceverything is in danger.\u201d Last fall, his troops could fly their drones\nfreely, taking out Russian targets. Now, due to jamming, they often cannot\nmove them much more than one mile before their screens go gray.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStanislav, 35, who runs a drone unit in eastern Ukraine said that within a\n10-kilometer radius controlled by his brigade and two others, there might be\n100 reconnaissance and attack drones flying back-and-forth.\n\n\u201cThe most challenging thing to figure out is if it\u2019s Ukrainian or Russian\ndrones,\u201d Stanislav said. \u201cWhen you see 10 drones in the sky there\u2019s no way to\nunderstand if it\u2019s our drone coming back after reconnaissance in Russian-\ncontrolled territory or if it\u2019s their drone which is coming for reconnaissance\nor attacking Ukrainian-controlled territory.\u201d\n\nAlthough the jamming systems he uses, developed by Ukrainian company Kvertus,\nhelp disrupt Russian flights, they also hamper his own. He said he wishes\nthere was a \u201cmagic button\u201d to disrupt all signals, but with drones using an\nincreasingly wide range of frequencies such technology is not available.\n\nRussia knows how valuable drone pilots are to Ukraine and \u201care targeting our\ndrone operators with aerial guided bombs and grad systems,\u201d Fox said.\n\nNastenko compared the precision of an advanced pilot to that of a jeweler; Fox\nlikened the skill set to that of a Formula 1 racecar driver.\n\nOn a recent mission, Nastenko\u2019s team \u2014 working from a foxhole near the zero\nline \u2014 launched a Vampire drone toward Russian positions. The thermal camera\ncombed over dead trees until it found Russian troops hiding on their side of\nthe line. Then, the drone dropped its payload, igniting a massive explosion. A\nrecording showed Russian troops\u2019 bodies as they went flying.\n\nThe drone returned back to its base, where the Ukrainian troops loaded it up\nagain and sent it back to kill any survivors. Meanwhile, another drone called\na Mavic lingered overhead, monitoring Russian movements. Its camera picked up\ntwo disoriented soldiers running side by side in circles, their camouflage\nuniforms turned an eerie white under the thermal lens. Then they separated,\nlooking for anywhere to hide. The Vampire drone homed in and fired again.\n\nIntercepted communications showed that the attack, which took roughly an hour,\nkilled eight Russian troops, Nastenko said.\n\nDays later, troops in his unit embarked on another mission. While in the\nfield, they came under an artillery attack, losing two of their own.\n\nDavid L.
