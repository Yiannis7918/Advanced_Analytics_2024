On day 200, he reduced his daily mileage on doctors advice in Nigeria.\n\u201cI took a couple of days to get some scans. No bone damage so figured the only\noption left was to stop mincing about like a little weasel, get the strongest\npainkillers available and zombie stomp road again,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nVisa problems getting into Algeria were overcome after his appeal video on X\nwas seen by 11 million people and the Algerian embassy in the UK announced he\nwould be given a courtesy visa.\n\nHe was due to celebrate with a finish-line party at a hotel in Bizerte,\nTunisia. \u201cGet your daiquiris ready girls & boys this is gonna be mega,\u201d he\nwrote.\n\nBefore setting off on his challenge, Cook revealed he wanted to \u201cmake a\ndifference\u201d, saying: \u201cI\u2019m a totally normal bloke, so if I can do this,\nhopefully people can apply this to their own lives in whichever way they\nchoose. For 99% of people, it\u2019s not going to be running across Africa, but it\nmight look like chasing their dreams a little bit more.\u201d\n\nHe has called the challenge \u201cthe toughest in my life but an immense honour\u201d,\nadding: \u201cWe have met incredible people in every single country we\u2019ve been to\nthat have welcomed us with love and kindness. The human spirit is a beautiful\nthing.\u201d\n\nCook is not new to challenges; previous ones have included running from\nIstanbul to London, being buried alive for a week and the fastest marathon\npulling a car.\n\nAlex Eagle, a friend and the co-founder of the Running Charity, where Cook\nworked as an adventure coach for young people before embarking on Project\nAfrica, told the Guardian when Cook first suggested the African odyssey,\n\u201cobviously it was outlandish, but we all thought he could do it\u201d.\n\n\u201cHe is a determined man, and he\u2019s a man that has overcome things like a lot of\nthe young people that we work with have overcome difficult challenges in their\nlives,\u201d he added.\n\nEagle did worry for Cook at times going into the unknown, but whenever they\nspoke he was \u201cpositive, always positive, always one step ahead in the moment,\nreally grateful for the experience, really grateful for the people he\u2019s met\n... That is his personality.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you are squeamish, the images of his feet are quite horrific at times,\u201d\nEagle added. Of the challenges, he said: \u201cThe scale of it. You hear it, but\nyou don\u2019t really comprehend it. He\u2019s just consistently been able to bring his\nmind to it, to get up every day and do that. It\u2019s just awe-inspiring.\u201d\n\nThe charity plans a group run on his return and Cook will also be running the\nLondon Marathon with young people from the charity. \u201cI think that will be a\nwalk in the park for him,\u201d Eagle said.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Africa\n  * Running\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
