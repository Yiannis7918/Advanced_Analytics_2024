My post was focused on the risk that a war will occur,\nbut it didn\u2019t really focus on the risk that the U.S. and its allies will be\ndefeated in that war. Yes, nuclear weapons are a factor, but there\u2019s no\ncertainty they\u2019ll be unleashed in WW3, even by the losing side. So yes, there\nis a chance the U.S. and its allies could be defeated by China and its allies\nin a major conventional world war.\n\nHow big is this chance of defeat? Obviously, factors like training and\ncompetence come into play, and these are in favor of the U.S. Technological\nsophistication is also important, and here as well, the developed democracies\nprobably still have at least a small edge over China.\n\nBut in World War 2, both skill/experience and technological sophistication\nslightly favored the Axis over the Allies at the start of the war. Nazi\nGermany started with the best ground equipment, while Japan had the best\nfighter planes and torpedoes, and arguably the best aircraft carriers as well.\nBut over time, massive U.S. and Soviet production of ships, planes, tanks, and\nmateriel ground down the Axis. And as the war progressed, the Allies learned\nhow to fight, and improved their technology rapidly, until by the end it was\nbetter than what the Axis had.\n\nIn a long conventional war, production really matters. And China has, since\nthe turn of the century, become by far the world\u2019s biggest producer. Even\nbefore the current massive splurge of production, China was the world\u2019s\nlargest manufacturer by far, making as much physical stuff as the U.S. and all\nof Europe combined. The country\u2019s current effort to increase that share even\nfurther threatens to make China the \u201cmake-everything country\u201d in reality,\nturning the rest of the world into a de-industrialized hinterland. If that\nhappens, the democracies\u2019 edges in technology and training will prove short-\nlived, and they will likely lose a long war unless they can very rapidly\nremember how to make physical goods en masse.\n\nIn a post two years ago, I tried to illustrate the sheer size of the challenge\nthat the U.S. and its allies are facing. It\u2019s something we need to be taking\nvery seriously. Anyone who scoffs at industrial policy or the idea of bringing\nback manufacturing in the U.S. and Europe needs to be able to answer the\nquestions raised by this post.\n\nI wish I didn\u2019t have to live through an era of renewed great power conflict. I\nwish the end of the Cold War had meant that such destructive episodes were\nforever relegated to the history books. But unfortunately, those wishes did\nnot come true. The Ukraine war means that we are now definitely in a long-term\nCold War type struggle with Russia. And the substantial chance of a Chinese\ninvasion of Taiwan sometime in the next few years \u2014 as highlighted by the\nfuror over Nancy Pelosi\u2019s planned Taiwan visit \u2014 means that there\u2019s a high\nlikelihood that we\u2019ll also soon be enmeshed in a contest with China as well.\n\nHopefully neither of these conflicts will result in direct war between great\npowers (especially because all the great powers now have plenty of nuclear\nweapons). I am not arguing that we are headed for World War 3 here. But a\nsequel to the Cold War \u2014 a protracted geopolitical struggle in which both\nsides prepare for the possibility that they might have to fight each other \u2014\nseems extremely likely at this point. So likely, in fact, that we can\u2019t afford\nnot to plan for it.\n\nThat\u2019s what the concept of the War Economy is about. As Anduril founder Palmer\nLuckey says, \u201ccurrent year is too late to care about current thing\u201d. We began\nto prepare for a possible conflict with the original Axis several years before\nWorld War 2 broke out, and in the Cold War we prepared for a World War 3 that\nfortunately never came. We must prepare again now. And that means far more\nthan just spending money on defense; it means reorganizing our economy to\npromote certain industries, build or rebuild certain capacities, and\nreorganize supply chains.\n\nThe scale and nature of the task is determined by the capabilities of the\nopposition. In World War 2, the Axis powers had advanced manufacturing\nprowess, but small populations and a lack of access to fuel. In the Cold War,\nthe Soviet bloc had a lot of fuel and a population similar to ours, but had a\nsmall and dysfunctional economy and struggled with advanced manufacturing. In\ncontrast, a potential \u201cNew Axis\u201d of Russia and China would control enormous\npopulation, vast fuel resources, advanced manufacturing capabilities, and a\ncombined economy of enormous size. Except for the fuel part, this is all just\nChina.\n\nSo today\u2019s post is about how the U.S. and its likely allies stack up against\nthe New Axis in economic terms.\n\n####\n\nIs there actually a New Axis?\n\nBefore we compare the two potential blocs, we should ask whether the New Axis\nis a real thing. \u201cNew Axis\u201d is just a term I made up to refer to the\ncombination of China and Russia (and whatever other allies and fellow-\ntravelers they can muster). The idea that these two powers are de facto allies\nagainst the U.S. is based on the joint statement they released before the\nUkraine war.\n\nWhen I use the tern \u201cNew Axis\u201d, though, people occasionally scoff, arguing\nthat China and Russia have too few common interests and too much mutual\nsuspicion to form any kind of close alliance. And maybe this is true. So far,\nChina has been reluctant to offer substantial support to Russia for its\ninvasion of Ukraine:\n\nBrian Bonner @BSBonner\n\nChina is not coming to Russia\u2019s rescue @GIS_Reports\n\ngisreportsonline.comChina is not coming to Russia\u2019s rescueChina is snapping up\nenergy bargains from Western-sanctioned Russia, but Beijing is wary of arming\nMoscow in its war on Ukraine.\n\n6:17 AM \u2219 Jul 26, 2022\n\n492Likes114Retweets\n\nChinese companies, afraid of sanctions, aren\u2019t even investing much in Russia.\n\nBut it\u2019s worth remembering that the original Axis wasn\u2019t that close of an\nalliance either. Germany and Japan signed some agreements and both fought\nagainst the U.S., but they didn\u2019t work together much at all during the war.\nThey also didn\u2019t team up against the USSR \u2014 Japan signed a non-aggression pact\nwith the Soviets (which the Soviets themselves broke only in the very last\ndays of the war), and notably failed to come to Germany\u2019s aid in Operation\nBarbarossa.\n\nIn order to be comparable to the original Axis, a New Axis of Russia and China\nwouldn\u2019t even have to work together militarily or give each other arms. Russia\nwould have to sell China fuel, but other than that, they really could just\nignore each other and focus on fighting the U.S. and its allies in separate\ntheaters.\n\nEven in this \u201cminimal New Axis\u201d case, the U.S. and its allies have to prepare\nto oppose both Russia and China at the same time. As long as Russia and China\ndon\u2019t fight each other and Russia provides China with fuel, they might as well\nbe allies in the new Cold War.\n\n####\n\nWho would the two blocs include?\n\nTo size up the two blocs, we have to assign countries to them, and this is\nhighly speculative. Even in World War 2, the final composition of the Allies\nwasn\u2019t determined until Hitler invaded the USSR; indeed, during the early days\nof the conflict, it looked as if the USSR might even join the Nazis, or at\nleast sit things out. So there\u2019s a lot of guesswork here.\n\nOn the New Axis side, I\u2019m just going to include China and Russia. North Korea\nis also included, but it\u2019s very small and really all it can do is fight South\nKorea, so I\u2019ll ignore it. Then there are a couple of wild cards like Pakistan\nand Iran, but these have generally low capabilities and little reason to get\ninvolved with a global great-power conflict, so I\u2019ll leave them out too.\n\nThe harder question is which countries would be on the U.S.\u2019 side in this new\nCold War. Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has united most of Europe against Russia\nand deepened transatlantic cooperation, which puts a lot of people and GDP and\nmanufacturing capacity in the U.S.\u2019 corner. And Japan will likely be the U.S.\u2019\nmain partner in a conflict with China over Taiwan. So I\u2019ll include the EU, the\nUK, and Japan in the \u201cNew Allies\u201d. I\u2019ll leave out South Korea, assuming it\nwill be tied down by North Korea. I\u2019ll also leave out some smaller countries\nlike Canada and Australia that would almost certainly be part of the New\nAllies; this is at least partially balanced by the fact that some EU countries\nlike Hungary wouldn\u2019t really cooperate.\n\nThe really big wild card here is India, which has a huge population and a\nreasonably hefty economy. The USSR was India\u2019s protector during the Cold War,\nand much of India\u2019s military equipment still comes from Russia (though this is\nstarting to shift). So India can\u2019t be expected to enter into any conflict\nagainst Russia. But China is a very different matter. China is India\u2019s main\nmilitary threat, and the two countries have come to blows recently over a\ndisputed border. They are also rivals for influence in the Indo-Pacific\nregion. This is why India has joined the Quad, forging a loose quasi-alliance\nwith the U.S., Japan and Australia whose purpose is obviously to hedge against\nChina.\n\nThus, because India\u2019s status is still pretty uncertain, I\u2019ll do two\ncomparisons: one with just the New Allies of the U.S., EU, UK, and Japan, and\none with the New Allies + India.\n\nBecause of the uncertain nature of the coalitions (and because of my omission\nof smaller coalition partners on both sides), these comparisons should be\ntaken as rough and indicative rather than definitive. All numbers are the most\nrecent available.\n\n####\n\nThe tale of the tape: Population, GDP, and manufacturing output\n\n\u201cQuantity has a quality all its own.\u201d - Joseph Stalin\n\nFirst, let\u2019s just talk about population. Obviously that\u2019s only one input to\nnational power, but it\u2019s worth looking at anyway:\n\nWhat this chart really just shows is that China and India are really, really,\nreally big compared to every other country, and even compared to the EU.\nThat\u2019s a fact worth remembering.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at GDP. GDP is important for military strength because unless\nyou\u2019re operating a command economy, you have to pay for your army somehow, and\nGDP determines the available tax revenue. There\u2019s a debate as to whether it\u2019s\nmore appropriate to use nominal GDP or purchasing power parity adjusted GDP in\nthese comparisons. So I\u2019ll just sidestep that debate by showing both, because\nthey really don\u2019t tell that different of a story:\n\nSource: IMF\n\nSource: IMF\n\nNumbers here are in millions of dollars.\n\nThe basic story here is that the New Allies have a substantially higher GDP\nthan the New Axis, with or without India on board. The difference is a bit\nnarrowed when we use PPP, to a ratio of 1.7 instead of 2.3 (without India).\nThe other thing we see from this comparison is that in economic terms as well\nas population, the New Axis is mostly just China.\n\nOf course, we could expect these figures to change in the result of a war, as\na result of sanctions, disruptions to supply chains, financial market changes,\nwar production, and a variety of other things. So this is just an indicative\nmeasure of where we stand.\n\nBut anyway, paying for your army is one thing, but if your alliance can\u2019t\nactually make the things you need to fight a war, then having a bunch of\ndollars is not so useful. Modern warfare requires making a lot of stuff \u2014\nmissiles, drones, ships, tanks, trucks, ammo, and so on. So manufacturing\noutput is probably important, above and beyond simple GDP; when a war rolls\naround, dollars that come from tourism, or from selling fancy wine, are going\nto be of less use than dollars of factory output. Anyway, here\u2019s the\ncomparison, again in millions of dollars:\n\nSource: World Bank\n\nHere we see it\u2019s a much closer-run thing. India doesn\u2019t manufacture a ton, so\nwith or without India, the New Allies just barely out-manufacture the New\nAxis.\n\nThe reason, as before, is China. As Damien Ma says, China has become the \u201cmake\neverything country\u201d. Before the turn of the century, a very large percent of\nthe manufacturing in the world, in terms of value, was done in the old\nindustrialized economies of the U.S., Europe, and Japan. But in the last 20\nyears, China has emerged as a second center of manufacturing that rivals all\nof the old industrialized nations combined. On some deep level, I suspect this\nshift is why we\u2019re seeing the revival of great-power conflict.\n\nWhat this means is that while Russia itself can\u2019t manufacture the materiel for\na protracted local conflict with Europe, China can manufacture enough to\nsustain both itself and Russia in a conflict between the two blocs I\u2019m\nenvisioning here.\n\n####\n\nSpecific economic capabilities\n\n\u201cThe North can make a steam engine, locomotive, or railway car; hardly a yard\nof cloth or pair of shoes can you make.\u201d - William T. Sherman\n\nThe manufacturing comparison in the previous section was pretty broad; the\ntotal value added figure leaves out lots of important stuff. It doesn\u2019t tell\nus how technologically advanced a country\u2019s weapons systems are. It doesn\u2019t\ntell us what percent of manufacturing capacity could be repurposed to military\nuses.\n\nAnd most importantly, it doesn\u2019t show how complete a country\u2019s supply chains\nare. If you go into a war with manufacturing companies that depend on the\nenemy countries for critical components, it doesn\u2019t matter how much value-\nadded you produce in peacetime \u2014 your factories will grind to a halt. Value\nadded is calculated on the margin, in peacetime, while wartime manufacturing\ncapability is inframarginal \u2014 it\u2019s the amount you can make after wrenching\nchanges close you off to your peacetime supply chains. During the early Covid\npandemic, the U.S. painfully rediscovered this principle when it found itself\nunable to make enough masks, Covid tests, or ventilators. But later in the\npandemic, the U.S. had the advanced biotech supply chains to pump out huge\namounts of mRNA vaccines, while China was the one to struggle.\n\nThus, it\u2019s very hard to tell which supply chain pieces will end up being the\nchoke points in a conflict. This is why the Biden administration is working\nfeverishly on this problem, and I\u2019m sure the Chinese authorities are doing the\nsame. But there are a few things we can probably predict will be important.\n\nFirst, fuel. (At this point I\u2019ll stop doing the stacked bar charts and just\nshow a map.) We can see that both of the posited blocs would have ample access\nto oil:\n\nCoal is a similar story \u2014 China and Russia have plenty, but so do the U.S. and\nAustralia. Gas is also roughly similar.\n\nSo on paper, both blocs have enough fossil fuels. For the New Axis, the\nquestion would mainly be whether Russia can get enough oil and gas to China \u2014\nit would involve either moving a lot of tankers through potentially contested\nwaters, or building a ton of very expensive difficult pipelines across the\nvast expanses of Eurasia. Of course, the U.S. would face a similar problem\ngetting oil, coal and gas to its allies in Europe and Asia.\n\nOf course, fossil fuels aren\u2019t the only type of energy out there. There\u2019s also\nrenewables. Carting around the energy from renewables requires a lot of\nbatteries (and maybe some electrolyzers), which requires a lot of minerals.\nDavid Roberts has a good breakdown of mineral requirements for alternative\nenergy, with some good charts showing where the minerals are located. Graphite\nand rare earths are concentrated in China, while cobalt and platinum are\nconcentrated in Africa:\n\nSource: Volts, IEA\n\nOf course, this is just current production. The U.S. and its allies will\nprobably be able to develop domestic supplies of rare earths and graphite if\nthey have to, just as Japan started mining rare earths when China cut it off.\nBut finding and exploiting these resources takes time, so the New Allies\nshould probably be looking at this right now.\n\nThen there\u2019s the question of where the minerals are processed. Here we see\nthat the answer is mostly \u201cChina\u201d:\n\nSource: Volts, IEA\n\nThis seems like a real vulnerability for the New Allies. My suspicion is that\nthere are a lot of other basic, \u201cprimary industry\u201d type of tasks that\ndeveloped countries have lazily let migrate en masse to China because they\naren\u2019t very high up the value chain. But in a conflict situation, \u201chigh up the\nvalue chain\u201d suddenly means a lot less.\n\nSemiconductors \u2014 i.e., computer chips \u2014 are an additional consideration.\n\u201cChips are the new oil\u201d, as they say, which means that semiconductors are used\nin pretty much every piece of machinery. That includes all the machines of war\nand war production. Currently, the New Allies produce most of the\nsemiconductors in the world, though China is racing to catch up:\n\nBut despite China\u2019s mightiest efforts, this looks like an area where the New\nAllies will maintain a decisive advantage over the next decade.\n\nIn general, what looking at supply chain choke points shows us is that neither\nthe New Axis nor the New Allies represents a fully self-contained, integrated\neconomic machine that can make everything it needs for a major conflict. The\npast 20 years have seen China and the old industrialized nations develop a\nsymbiotic relationship \u2014 they are deeply intertwined. (One would hope this\nwould be enough to prevent a conflict, but that\u2019s almost certainly wishful\nthinking given past experience.)\n\nWhat that means is that in the event of a conflict, each bloc would be\nscrambling to shore up its weak points \u2014 China scrambling to build more chip\nfabs and secure more oil from Russia, the U.S. and Europe and Japan scrambling\nto rebuild the low-value primary industries that they outsourced to China.\n\n####\n\nThe stiffest economic competition ever\n\nI can\u2019t say whether or not the New Axis is the most formidable military\ncompetitor that the U.S. and its allies have ever faced. The original Axis was\ncertainly fearsome, and the USSR had tens of thousands of nuclear weapons\nready to roast the world at the touch of a button. But I think that the\ncomparisons above show that the New Axis certainly represents an economic\ncompetitor like none the U.S. and its allies have ever faced. And the reason\nis simply China. Russia is mainly a gas station with nukes. But China has\nthree things going for it:\n\n  1. China has far, far more workers than the original Axis or the Soviet bloc.\n\n  2. China has advanced manufacturing technology that probably rivals the original Axis in relative terms, and far exceeds the Soviet bloc.\n\n  3. China has the world\u2019s largest manufacturing cluster, making it the \u201cmake everything country\u201d, which neither the Axis nor the USSR managed to be.\n\nThis is simply a unique situation in modern history. The Industrial Revolution\nbegan in Europe and spread to the U.S. and the East Asian rim. The aftermath\nof WW2 saw central Europe and the East Asian rim incorporated into a U.S.-led\nalliance that dominated global manufacturing in a way that the communist\npowers could never threaten. Now, with the rise of China, world manufacturing\nis divided roughly in two.\n\nMuch of the War Economy in the U.S. (and its allies) will therefore be about\nrediscovering the manufacturing capabilities they neglected during China\u2019s\nmeteoric rise.\n\nShare\n\n99 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n10 Restacks\n\n99\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Sizing up the New Axis\n\nwww.noahpinion.blog\n\n18\n\nShare\n\n18 Comments\n\nBoogaloo8 hrs ago\u00b7edited 8 hrs agoI actually think the real determinant will\nbe geography. It's not just India that matters here. I strongly suspect it\nwill be 'The Entire World' vs 'China'We have that China has an attack vector\naimed at all of its neighbours: Vietnamn, Thailand, The Phillipines,\nIndonesia, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, and so forth. However, the\nUSA has no attack vectors aimed at any of these countries! Being the far away\npower.This means that the rational realist approach for any of these nations\nis to ally with the United States.The USA can not threaten the sovereignty of\nany of these nations the way that China can. Which means they will ally with\nthe USA. Furthermore the USA has proved to uphold international law over the\npast 60 years or so which allowed these nations to trade freely and they do\nnot know if China will allow them to do the same.History matters here too,\nChina has invaded many of these countries dozens of times in the past already.\nAnd none of them were very happy about that. China already has border disputes\nwith basically all of their neighbours:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_disputes_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_ChinaSome\nof these nations will try to balance for as long as they and can as I suspect\nIndonesia will. But if push comes to shove they will ally with the USA.Due to\nthe USA (And perhaps ultimately the Dutch) creating the current structure of\nthe global liberal word order China is checkmated at the outset because of\nwhere all the attack vectors point at. China will undoubtedly try to invade\nTaiwan, but strongly suspect it will find itself with no allies besides a weak\nally in Russia.I suspect we will have hot proxy conflicts with in total a few\nmillion dead the coming decade, and with near certainty we will have navy\nbattles in the Indo-Pacific for a while but I think due to the structure of\nthe international system and nuclear weapons we won't have a WW3.The global\nliberal order is indeed dead. The world is multipolar now and you will find a\nrise in illiberal nationalism in all of the western world (as is already\nhappening(and this is rational btw)), Israel is an apartheid state (and we\nwill continue to support Israel), and you will see China spend all of its\nenergy to carve out it's own block in this world. They will try, and we will\ntry, but we'll mostly end up on top.(Also 85% of the world's trade is done in\ndollars and the Ukraine war didn't change this)We should still manufacture all\nof the important things as much as possible of course.Expand full commentLike\n(8)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nChris McKee9 hrs agoCalifornia is building lithium extraction operations for\nUS batteries:https://www.enr.com/articles/58102-groundbreaking-lithium-\nextraction-plant-launches-in-californiaIt will need to be protected against\ndrones and missiles the way Israel was today.
