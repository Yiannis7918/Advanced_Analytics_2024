\ud83d\udcd6 usage | \ud83d\ude4b configuration | \ud83d\udc1a shell integration | \u2697\ufe0f development | \ud83d\udc96 acknowledgements\n\nmommy's here to support you! mommy will compliment you if things go well, and\nwill encourage you if things are not going so well~\n\nmommy is fully customizable, integrates with any shell, works on any system,\nand most importantly, loves you very much~ \u2764\ufe0f\n\n## \ud83d\ude9a installation ^top \u25b2\n\nmommy works on any system. mommy is tested on ubuntu, debian, archlinux,\nfedora, nixpkgs, macos, freebsd, netbsd, openbsd, and windows~\n\ndon't see your favourite distro or package manager listed? need help?\notherwise not satisfied? please open an issue~\n\n### \ud83d\udc69\ud83d\udcbc with a package manager\n\nfind your operating system and package manager for the right instructions~\n\n### \ud83d\udc10 without a package manager\n\n### \ud83d\udd2e what's next?\n\ncheck out how to use mommy, read all about ways you can configure mommy, and\nintegrate mommy with your shell~\n\n## \ud83d\udcd6 usage ^top \u25b2\n\nmommy processes (the output status of) a command and compliments you if the\ncommand succeeds and encourages you if it fails~\n\nTip\n\nthe recommended way of long-term mommy usage is to integrate mommy into your\nshell, so mommy will run after every command you run~\n\n### \ud83d\udc83 how to run\n\nfor reference, here's the three main ways to invoke mommy~\n\nformat| example| when to use  \n---|---|---  \nmommy [command] ...| mommy npm test| if you want mommy to respond to a single\ncommand~  \nmommy -e [command]| mommy -e \"ls -l | wc -l\"| if you want mommy when using | or >, or need mommy in a script~  \nmommy -s [status]| mommy -s $?| if you already ran a command and want mommy's\nhelp afterwards~  \n  \n### \ud83d\udef8 extra options\n\nadditionally, mommy knows a few extra options, which you can use to discover\nwho mommy is and to tell mommy which configuration files she should use~\n\nshort option| long option| description  \n---|---|---  \n-h| \\--help| opens mommy's manual page~  \n-v| \\--version| displays mommy's version information~  \n-1| writes output to stdout instead of stderr~  \n-c <file>| \\--config=<file>| tells mommy that she should read your config from <file>~  \n-d <dirs>| \\--global-config-dirs=<dirs>| sets global configuration dirs to the colon-separated list in <dirs>~  \n  \n## \ud83d\ude4b configuration ^top \u25b2\n\nmommy's behavior can be modified using config files. the easiest way to do so\nis to add your config to the file ~/.config/mommy/config.sh. you can also set\nup a global config file that is applied to all users, by default in\n/etc/mommy/config.sh. read more about the way config files are loaded~\n\nmommy supports a lot of different settings. if you want to configure the value\nof MOMMY_SWEETIE, add the following line to your config file:\n\n    \n    \n    MOMMY_SWEETIE=\"catgirl\"\n\nmake sure you do not put spaces around the =, and you do put quotes (\") around\nthe value~\n\n## \ud83d\udc1a shell integration ^top \u25b2\n\ninstead of calling mommy for each command, you can fully integrate mommy with\nyour shell to get mommy's output each time you run any command. here are some\nexamples on how you can do that in various shells. recall that you can add\nMOMMY_COMPLIMENTS_ENABLED=0 to your mommy config file to disable compliments\nwhile keeping encouragements~\n\nthis is just a small list of possibilities. if you know of another way to\nintegrate mommy, feel free to contribute them by opening a pull request!\n\n## \u2697\ufe0f development ^top \u25b2\n\nthis section explains how to build mommy from source, in case you want to help\nwith development or for any other reason~\n\n## \ud83d\udc96 acknowledgements ^top \u25b2\n\nmommy recognises all contributors, no matter the size of the contribution. if\nmommy should add,
