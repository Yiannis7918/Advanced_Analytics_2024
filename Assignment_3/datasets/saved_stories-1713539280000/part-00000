They have zero\n> right, none, to the tracking they\u2019ve been getting away with. We, as a\n> society, have implicitly accepted it because we never really noticed it.\n> You, the user, have no way of seeing it happen. Our brains are naturally\n> attuned to detect and viscerally reject, with outrage and alarm, real-world\n> intrusions into our privacy. Real-world marketers could never get away with\n> tracking us like online marketers do... Just because there is now a multi-\n> billion-dollar industry based on the abject betrayal of our privacy doesn\u2019t\n> mean the sociopaths who built it have any right whatsoever to continue\n> getting away with it. They talk in circles but their argument boils down to\n> entitlement: they think our privacy is theirs for the taking because they\u2019ve\n> been getting away with taking it without our knowledge, and it is valuable.\n> No action Apple can take against the tracking industry is too strong.\n\nJohn Gruber in 2024, on the EU\u2019s actions which limit Facebook\u2019s ability to\ntrack users:\n\n> What makes this all the more outrageous is that many major publishers in the\n> EU use this exact same \u201cpay or OK\u201d model to achieve GDPR compliance \u2014 and\n> none offer a free alternative with non-targeted ads. Don\u2019t hold your breath\n> waiting for Der Spiegel to offer free access without ads. Christ, they don\u2019t\n> even let you look at their homepage without paying or consenting to targeted\n> ads. And Spotify quite literally brags about its ad targeting. But Spotify\n> is an EU company, so of course it wasn\u2019t designated as a \u201cgatekeeper\u201d by the\n> protection racketeers running the European Commission... They\u2019re not saying\n> \u201cpay or OK\u201d is illegal. They\u2019re saying it\u2019s illegal only if you\u2019re a big\n> company from outside the EU with a very popular platform.\n\nI wonder what happened to turn John\u2019s attitude from \u201cno action Apple can take\nagainst the tracking industry is too strong\u201d to defending Facebook\u2019s \u201cright\u201d\nto choose how it invades people\u2019s privacy? Or is he suggesting that a private\ncompany is entitled to defend people\u2019s privacy, but governments are not?\n\nAnd John\u2019s second point about Spotify fundamentally misunderstands the nature\nof antitrust law in general and the EU gatekeeper system specifically. In\ncompetition, actions which are legal when you\u2019re not a monopoly become illegal\nwhen you are a monopoly.\n\nIn particular, Apple \u2013 and Facebook \u2013 are gatekeepers because they \u201care\ndigital platforms that provide an important gateway between business users and\nconsumers \u2013 whose position can grant them the power to act as a private rule\nmaker, and thus creating a bottleneck in the digital economy\u201d. Spotify is not\nin that position. Der Spiegel is not in that position. Different rules apply \u2013\nas they do to Tidal (not an EU company), and of course to the New York Times.\n\nThis really is not difficult to understand.\n\nBut underneath this in part is John\u2019s feeling that EU antitrust law is all an\nEU conspiracy to attack American companies. That would be news to Daimler,\nfined over a billion euros for an illegal cartel. It would news to Scania,\nfined 880m euro. To DAF, fined 715m euro. To Phillips, fined 705m euro. And so\non. The EU fines European companies big sums of money all the time for\nbreaking competition law.\n\nThe entire point of the EU is to create single, competitive markets. It does\nnot allow big companies to \u201cown\u201d markets because free markets (in the EU\u2019s\neyes) are good, and privately owned ones that allow big companies to stop\nbeing capitalists and act like feudal lords are bad. Facebook, Apple, and the\nrest have been doing this in digital for a long time, and the EU has decided\nit\u2019s going to stop.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### Related\n\nWeeknotes: Sunday 6th SeptemberSeptember 6, 2020In \"Weeknotes\"\n\nSome stuff which caught my eyes this weekOctober 16, 2022In \"Life\"\n\nWhat the Epic vs Google case means for contentDecember 13, 2023\n\n### One Comment\n\n  1. Ian Betteridge April 19, 2024 at 9:48 am\n\nmatthewcowen: @ianbetteridge I must admit that I didn\u2019t have Gruber as a\nFacebook apologist on my 2024 bingo care, but here we are. I\u2019ve seen his shift\nover the last couple of years ever since he started a podcast with Ben\nThompson. Although, I\u2019m not saying correlation is causation, of course. Ben\noften defends Facebook on the premise that it helps businesses, particularly\nsmall businesses, advertise like the big boys. That\u2019s false on two levels 1)\nthey get the worst rates, and 2) the efficiency of highly targeted ads is\npatently false, as this (and other) studies have shown:\nop.europa.eu/en/public... One last point: I\u2019ve seen arguments suggesting that\nthe EU is blocking Facebook from doing business, i.e. \u201cWhat business model can\nthey use?\u201d (ex. Casey Newton). The EU is not blocking advertising, and\nFacebook is free to use ads; it is blocking the egregious, surveillance,\nprivacy-trashing-crap-that-only-fills-the-coffers-of-Facebook-not-anyone-else\nadverts. The \u201cpay or show us the contents of your last turd\u201d Hobson\u2019s choice\nis just a step too far, and I\u2019m glad it is getting called out for what it is\nby the EU. Facebook is free to do business where it wants, but it must abide\nby the rules, unlike the many years it has wilfully avoided doing so with\nrespect to the GDPR. via micro.blog\n\nLikeLike\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a comment Cancel reply\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
