Rules\nfor detecting \"out-of-control\" or non-random conditions were first postulated\nby Walter A. Shewhart^[1] in the 1920s. The Nelson rules were first published\nin the October 1984 issue of the Journal of Quality Technology in an article\nby Lloyd S Nelson.^[2]\n\nThe rules are applied to a control chart on which the magnitude of some\nvariable is plotted against time. The rules are based on the mean value and\nthe standard deviation of the samples.\n\nRule| Description| Chart Example| Problem Indicated  \n---|---|---|---  \nRule 1| One point is more than 3 standard deviations from the mean.| One\nsample (two shown in this case) is grossly out of control.  \nRule 2| Nine (or more) points in a row are on the same side of the mean.| Some\nprolonged bias exists.  \nRule 3| Six (or more) points in a row are continually increasing (or\ndecreasing).| A trend exists.  \nRule 4| Fourteen (or more) points in a row alternate in direction, increasing\nthen decreasing.| This much oscillation is beyond noise.Note that the rule is\nconcerned with directionality only. The position of the mean and the size of\nthe standard deviation have no bearing.  \nRule 5| Two (or three) out of three points in a row are more than 2 standard\ndeviations from the mean in the same direction.| There is a medium tendency\nfor samples to be mediumly out of control.The side of the mean for the third\npoint is unspecified.  \nRule 6| Four (or five) out of five points in a row are more than 1 standard\ndeviation from the mean in the same direction.| There is a strong tendency for\nsamples to be slightly out of control.The side of the mean for the fifth point\nis unspecified.  \nRule 7| Fifteen points in a row are all within 1 standard deviation of the\nmean on either side of the mean.| With 1 standard deviation, greater variation\nwould be expected.  \nRule 8| Eight points in a row exist, but none within 1 standard deviation of\nthe mean, and the points are in both directions from the mean.| Jumping from\nabove to below while missing the first standard deviation band is rarely\nrandom.  \n  \nThe above eight rules apply to a chart of a variable value.\n\nA second chart, the moving range chart, can also be used but only with rules\n1, 2, 3 and 4. Such a chart plots a graph of the maximum value - minimum value\nof N adjacent points against the time sample of the range.\n\nAn example moving range: if N = 3 and values are 1, 3, 5, 3, 3, 2, 4, 5 then\nthe sets of adjacent points are (1,3,5) (3,5,3) (5,3,3) (3,3,2) (3,2,4)\n(2,4,5) resulting in moving range values of (5-1) (5-3) (5-3) (3-2) (4-2)\n(5-2) = 4, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3.\n\nApplying these rules indicates when a potential \"out of control\" situation has\narisen. However, there will always be some false alerts and the more rules\napplied the more will occur. For some processes, it may be beneficial to omit\none or more rules. Equally there may be some missing alerts where some\nspecific \"out of control\" situation is not detected. Empirically, the\ndetection accuracy is good.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Common cause and special cause\n  * Statistical process control\n  * Western Electric rules\n  * Westgard rules\n  * American Society for Quality, Quality Tools\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Engineering Statistics Handbook 6.3.2, NIST/SEMATECH e-Handbook of Statistical Methods National Institute of Standards and Technology, Dec 2006\n  2. ^ Lloyd S.
