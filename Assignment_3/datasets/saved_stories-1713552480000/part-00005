On Monday, the company laid\noff 10% of its workforce after disappointing company earnings showed a decline\nin the number of cars it delivered in the first three months of the year. Its\nstock price has fallen nearly 40% this year, and Tesla has reportedly stopped\ndevelopment of a cheaper vehicle option so it can focus on self-driving\nrobotaxis \u2014a move that has made some analysts more pessimistic about the\ncompany.\n\nThe Cybertruck has done little to change that narrative. The futuristic-\nlooking vehicle has generated plenty of buzz but also scrutiny over everything\nfrom its safety and reliability to its sharp edges and reports of rust spots\non its stainless steel body.\n\nThe pedal problem was raised on social media this week by one driver who found\nthat the vehicle was accelerating on its own after the accelerator became\nstuck to the floor when a rubber cover came loose.\n\nA TikTok video of Cybertruck owner Jose Martinez illustrating the problem has\nbeen shared more than 42,000 times and viewed more than 6 million times on X,\nthe social network which, like Tesla, is owned by billionaire Elon Musk.\n\nThe NHTSA said in its recall report that the fault was caused by \"residual\nlubricant (soap)\" which had been used to apply the rubber pad during the\nmanufacturing process. It said \"Tesla will replace or rework the accelerator\npedal assembly\" at no extra charge.\n\nThe NHTSA said Tesla first received notice of a customer complaint about the\naccelerators on March 31, followed by a second on April 3. The report said\nthat Tesla made the determination to voluntarily recall the vehicles on April\n12.\n\nIt also said Tesla has already begun to address the issue on vehicles in\nproduction or at delivery centers.\n\nPatrick Smith\n\nPatrick Smith is a London-based editor and reporter for NBC News Digital.\n\n\u00a9 2024 NBC UNIVERSAL\n\nWe and our partners use cookies on this site to improve our service, perform\nanalytics, personalize advertising, measure advertising performance, and\nremember website preferences.
