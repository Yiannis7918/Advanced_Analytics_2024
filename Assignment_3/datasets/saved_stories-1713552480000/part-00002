Misra, 39,\npreviously worked at Truecaller AB and Meta Platforms Inc. and is set to start\nat OpenAI toward the end of the month.\n\nThe hiring highlights the generative-AI company\u2019s efforts to push for\nfavorable rules as governments around the world consider how to regulate the\nrapidly developing technology. India \u2014 with its 1.4 billion people and a fast-\ngrowing economy \u2014 is a massive growth opportunity for global tech companies,\nbut it\u2019s also proven a difficult one to navigate because of lawmakers and\nregulators seeking to ensure local firms don\u2019t get trampled.\n\nOpenAI representatives didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment outside regular\nUS office hours. Misra didn\u2019t immediately respond to a LinkedIn message.\n\nMisra previously headed public affairs at Stockholm-traded contact\nverification firm Truecaller, which counts India as a top market. Before that,\nshe was at Meta Platforms Inc., where she led WhatsApp\u2019s campaign against\nmisinformation in 2018.\n\nIn India, OpenAI faces competition from the likes of Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google,\nwhich is developing an AI model specifically for the country. Its product will\nbe able to handle more than 100 local languages across speech and text, a\ndrive that would widen internet access beyond the country\u2019s urban English-\nspeaking minority.\n\nCountries such as India should support AI research in ways that can improve\ngovernment services like health care, OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam\nAltman said during his visit to India last year.\n\n\u201cThe main thing that I think is important is figuring out how to integrate\nthese technologies into other services,\u201d Altman said at the time. \u201cThat is an\narea that I think governments are behind on, and don\u2019t have the answers yet.\u201d\n\nAltman, who met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the tour, also said\nthat India was an early adopter of its generative-AI service ChatGPT.\n\nAltman has previously called for more regulations and said his \u201cgreatest fear\u201d\nis that the technology would cause significant harm. He has also said that big\nregulatory changes weren\u2019t needed for current versions of the technology, but\nwould be soon.\n\n## Latest in Tech\n\n  * 4 hours ago\n  * Tech - Apple\n\n## Apple could be trying to \u2018hedge its supply chain bets\u2019 away from China with\nCEO Tim Cook\u2019s whirlwind Southeast Asia tour\n\nBYLionel Lim\n\nApril 19, 2024\n\n  * 4 hours ago\n  * Tech - A.I.\n\n## OpenAI makes first India hire\u2014a public policy head to lobby government as\nit shapes AI regulations for world\u2019s most populous country\n\nBYSankalp Phartiyal and The Associated Press\n\nApril 19, 2024\n\n  * 9 hours ago\n  * Tech - China\n\n## Apple removes Meta-owned WhatsApp and Threads from its China app store\nafter Beijing deemed them national security risks\n\nBYMark Gurman, Sarah Zheng, and others\n\nApril 19, 2024\n\n  * a day ago\n  * Tech - semiconductors\n\n## Malaysia wants to benefit from chip companies trying to diversify their\nsupply chains: \u2018There is enough growth that will go around\u2019\n\nBYLionel Lim\n\nApril 18, 2024\n\n  * 2 days ago\n  * Tech - Indonesia\n\n## Apple CEO Tim Cook says \u2018we\u2019re investing\u2019 in Indonesia, fresh off his\npledge to spend more on Vietnam suppliers, continuing his Southeast Asia charm\noffensive\n\nBYNicholas Gordon\n\nApril 17, 2024\n\n  * 4 days ago\n  * Tech - smartphones and mobile devices\n\n## Apple loses its spot as the world\u2019s top seller of smartphones after tough\nChina competition from brands like Xiaomi and Huawei\n\nBYNicholas Gordon\n\nApril 15, 2024\n\n## Most Popular\n\n  * 2 days ago\n  * Retail\n\n## JCPenney expects to return half a billion dollars to customers this year\n\nBYChris Morris\n\nApril 17, 2024\n\n  * 2 days ago\n  * Finance\n\n## Luxury brands have a new headache in China: Stingy shoppers are returning\ntheir goods, erasing up to 75% of their sales value\n\nBYBloomberg\n\nApril 17, 2024\n\n  * 2 days ago\n  * Politics\n\n## Canada will soak the rich with capital gains tax jump to raise billions for\nhousing in market where Gen Z can\u2019t catch a break\n\nBYErik Hertzberg and Bloomberg\n\nApril 17, 2024\n\n  * 14 hours ago\n  * Tech\n\n## Exclusive: Mercedes becomes the first automaker to sell autonomous cars in\nthe U.S. that don\u2019t come with a requirement that drivers watch the road\n\nBYRachyl Jones\n\nApril 19, 2024\n\n  * 2 days ago\n  * Retail\n\n## Gen Z favorite Dr. Martens is struggling as its CEO steps down\u2014and it might\nbe because the shoes last too long\n\nBYJasmine Li\n\nApril 17, 2024\n\n  * 2 days ago\n  * Leadership\n\n## Dropbox\u2019s CEO says managers mandating returns to the office are just\n\u2018mashing the go-back-to-2019 button\u2019 and creating toxic relationships with\nstaff\n\nBYOrianna Rosa Royle\n\nApril 17, 2024\n\n\u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.
