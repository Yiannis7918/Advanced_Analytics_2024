By synergizing the strengths\n> of an off-the-shelf multiview diffusion model and a sparse-view\n> reconstruction model based on the LRM architecture, InstantMesh is able to\n> create diverse 3D assets within 10 seconds. To enhance the training\n> efficiency and exploit more geometric supervisions, e.g, depths and normals,\n> we integrate a differentiable iso-surface extraction module into our\n> framework and directly optimize on the mesh representation. Experimental\n> results on public datasets demonstrate that InstantMesh significantly\n> outperforms other latest image-to-3D baselines, both qualitatively and\n> quantitatively. We release all the code, weights, and demo of InstantMesh,\n> with the intention that it can make substantial contributions to the\n> community of 3D generative AI and empower both researchers and content\n> creators.\n\nComments:| Technical report.
