Isaac A. R. Kerr\n\nIn This Story\n\nDestination Guide\n\n### Australia\n\n92 Articles\n\n578 Places\n\nA dried-up lake bed sits in the heart of the Australian Outback, more than 100\nmiles from the nearest road or settlement. Beneath its dusty surface, multiple\nfossilized skeletons have been lying here for thousands\u2014even millions\u2014of\nyears. But though they\u2019re very large, these old bones do not belong to\ndinosaurs. The remains have been resting in Lake Callabonna since at least the\nlate Pleistocene epoch, and many of them belong to giant kangaroos that used\nto tower over humans.\n\nIt\u2019s really three previously unknown types of ancient kangaroos that met their\nend here. The findings at Lake Callabonna cracked open a world of marsupial\ndiscovery over the past decade, launching one Aussie researcher on a mission\nto find out more. That researcher is Isaac Kerr, a kangaroo paleontologist at\nFlinders University and the lead author of a study just published in the\njournal Megataxa.\n\nIsaac Kerr displays the fossil jaw of the giant kangaroo and the far smaller\njaw of the red kangaroo.

See Courses\n\nThe study identifies three previously undescribed kangaroo species belonging\nto the extinct genus Protemnodon, aka a genus of really big \u2018roos that lived\n40,000 to 5 million years ago. The biggest described is the newly named\nProtemnodon viator, a true behemoth that would have been twice the size of\neven the beefiest buck living today.\n\nCurrently, Australia\u2019s largest extant marsupial is the red kangaroo, which\nreaches about five feet when fully upright. P. viator would have stood at\nroughly six feet in a crouched position and eight feet tall if it were to\nstand up straight \u201cin a threat posture,\u201d Kerr says. But what\u2019s even more\nastonishing is their estimated weight: about 375 pounds versus the average\nmale red kangaroo of the present day, which weighs only up to 200 pounds.\n\nAn artist\u2019s impression of the newly described fossil species Protemnodon\nviator and its relative Protemnodon anak, compared at scale to the living red\nkangaroo and eastern grey kangaroo. Traci Klarenbeek\n\nP. viator would have looked sort of like a squat and muscular version of the\ngrey kangaroo (though clearly much bigger), as would all other Protemnodon\nspecies. Including the three introduced by this latest study\u2014P. viator, P.\nmamkurra, and P. dawsonae\u2014the genus now contains a total of seven species. The\ngenus was first raised 150 years ago by the Victorian-era British biologist\nSir Richard Owen, the same guy who coined the term \u201cdinosaur.\u201d\n\nAs technology advanced and better fossils were found, Owen\u2019s identification of\nthe species under Protemnodon have been challenged and redescribed. Part of\nthe reason for revisiting the research was the discovery of a megafaunal\nboneyard on Lake Callabonna in 2013. Kerr, who attended one of the subsequent\nexpeditions to Callabonna while pursuing his pHd, describes the lake as \u201cdry,\nvery remote in northeastern South Australia, and littered with megafauna\nskeletons poking out of the clay and eroding away.\u201d The dryness, he says, has\na lot to do with why the ancient Protemnodon species were so large.\n\nDigging up the largest-known skeleton of the extinct giant kangaroo, a\nspecimen nicknamed \u2018Old Gregg\u2019 for its great size and very worn teeth. Aaron\nB. Camens\n\nStarting about 10 million years ago, Australia experienced a period of\naridification that would have peaked 17,000 to 2.3 million years ago (i.e.,\nthe Protemnodon period). As the country dried out, kangaroos evolved to be\nbigger. They also became faster, more efficient hoppers, Kerr says, \u201cas they\nhad greater distances to cover for food and water, and more room to move\nquickly and in a straight line.\u201d\n\nThe fossils used for this study, found at Lake Callabonna as well as in the\ncollections of 14 different museums in four countries, show varying hopping\nmethods indicating a range of habitats across Protemnodon species. P. viator\nis named after the Latin word for \u201ctraveler,\u201d because it had such a broad\ndistribution, whereas P. dawsonae and P. mamkurra would have stuck to\nwoodlands.\n\nWith such a wide range, it\u2019s not unlikely that these giant kangaroos would\nhave crossed paths with some of the First Australians, who Kerr says probably\nwould have hunted them\u2014or at least would\u2019ve tried to. He says he hopes that\nthis investigation into Protemnodon lifestyles will help us better understand\nhow climate change has impacted Australian fauna in the past, and how it could\nimpact it in the future. Next, he anticipates returning to Lake Callabonna\nlater this year to collect specimens from the largest marsupial to ever live,\nthe Diprotodon optatum, a giant wombat-like creature that\u2019s now extinct, of\nwhich there are hundreds.\n\nRead next\n\n### Svalbard's Lonely Whaler Graves Included Burial Kits With Pieces of\nDistant Homes\n\nFor centuries, the cruel industry decimated entire whale species\u2014and claimed\ncountless human lives.
