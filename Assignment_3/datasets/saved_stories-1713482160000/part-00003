Most of them don\u2019t work, for most people, most of\nthe time.\n\nHow can this be?\n\nThe obvious answer seems to be that they are somewhat orthogonal to \u201cwhat\nactually works\u201d but accidentally hit some of the buttons, some of the time.\n\nSometimes, they use a heuristic that\u2019s not relevant, but leads some people to\ndo the right thing, and others to do the wrong thing.\n\nOther times, the diets do one thing right, but other things wrong: these work\nfor people whose only problem was the one thing this diet fixes.\n\n##\n\nFalse Positives\n\nA false positive would be something the diet allows, but which actually\nprevents fat loss. Presumably, the diet leaves this open to interpretation and\ndoesn\u2019t mandate it, or nobody would have success on the diet.\n\nOr it\u2019s only a false positive for certain people, and so it\u2019ll work for say\n30% of obese people, but not for the rest.\n\nAn example would be polyunsaturated fat or high protein on a Standard American\nKeto diet. The recommendations stipulate you eat a lot of fat, but not\ntechnically against PUFAs. Most ketoers won\u2019t exactly recommend you chug\nsoybean oil, but they do recommend a lot of foods that are very high in\nlinoleic acid, like commercial bacon or nuts.\n\nThis means that people who happen to like bacon and nuts will consume a lot of\nlinoleic acid, whereas people who naturally don\u2019t like those foods will avoid\nthem.\n\nThe efficacy of SAK can therefore depend on your food preferences, and if you\naccidentally travel the \u201ccorrect\u201d path across the wide-open keto space.\n\n##\n\nFalse Negatives\n\nFalse negatives are the opposite: the diet prohibits you from eating something\nwhich is not causal in your obesity. This might or might not be a problem.\n\nIn a not-so-bad case, say you\u2019re keto and it prohibits you from eating bread.\nMaybe you never liked bread, anyway. Maybe you\u2019ll miss pizza, but that\u2019s about\nit.\n\nOn the other hand, it could hit you real hard: if the diet prohibits most of\nyour favorite foods unnecessarily, it is unlikely you\u2019ll do it, even if it\nwould otherwise be efficacious.\n\nThis is a limiting factor for keto and carnivore. There\u2019s a certain percentage\nof the population that is willing to give up carbs forever, but it\u2019s probably\nno bigger than 15-30%. That means that 70-85% of people will never seriously\ndo keto or carnivore, even if it was the only effective way to lose weight.\n\nLuckily for those people, I don\u2019t think it is.\n\nStill, you can see how a diet with excessive false negatives would be harder\nto stick to, unless the foods that are allowed happen to exactly be your\nfavorites - as mostly happened with me and keto when I started it.\n\nPretty much the only foods I ever missed were pizza, once my favorite food,\nand - lentils. The lentil thing is a bit weird, and I\u2019ve never cheated with\nlentils once, I think. I just love the stew-like consistency.\n\nApart from that, I could still eat almost all of my favorite foods: meat, dark\nchocolate, cocoa, nuts, cream, cheese, grilled chicken, bacon & eggs.. keto\nhas a lot of false negatives (I think), but they barely affected me.\n\n##\n\nConcrete diet examples\n\nLet\u2019s analyze some diets in more detail so we can have concrete examples.\n\nFor this post let us stipulate that obesity is caused by these factors:\n\n  1. Excess linoleic acid in food intake & adipose tissue\n\n  2. Inability to switch efficiently between BCAA, glucose & fat metabolism (likely caused by 1.)\n\nThis post isn\u2019t about this particular set of hypotheses, even though it is\nwhat I believe to be true. But let\u2019s just use these to compare which diets\nhave which false positives & negatives, to illustrate the concept.\n\nIf these are the factors that cause obesity, what would the optimal diet\nrecommend to reverse obesity?\n\n  1. Cut out linoleic acid intake as much as possible\n\n  2. Severely limit at least 1, but likely 2 of {protein,carbs,fat}. You probably want to pick 1 of the energy macros (carbs/fat). You\u2019ll likely also need to restrict protein to a certain degree. In short, don\u2019t \u201cswamp\u201d your macros.\n\nOk, now that we\u2019ve assumed this to be the optimal diet (for comparison\npurposes), let\u2019s dive into some popular diets out there and see how they do.\n\n##\n\nVegetarianism / Veganism\n\nThe heuristics here are \u201cno dead animals\u201d or \u201cno animal products at all.\u201d\nSuffice it to say, both of these are completely orthogonal to our causal\nfactors.\n\nLinoleic acid is originally a plant product, but it is present in many animal\nproducts - monogastric animals fed a high corn/soybean diet, like commercial\npork and chicken.\n\nThe second causal factor, \u201cno swamping,\u201d is technically not implied at all by\neither heuristic, but in practice, most vegetarians or vegans will likely\nrestrict fat, and many protein.\n\nWhile you can get lots of fat from plant sources, cultural limitations and\n\u201cthat\u2019s how we\u2019ve always done it\u201d seem to lead most vegetarians/vegans to a\nlow-fat, low-protein diet.\n\nThis isn\u2019t always true: when I was vegetarian, I ate mostly dairy products. I\nlove dairy, and it\u2019s much more energy dense than most plant products, so I\ndidn\u2019t have to stuff my face with all those annoying grains & vegetables. Of\ncourse, I didn\u2019t lose much if any weight this way.\n\n##\n\nWhole-food plant based\n\nI\u2019m never quite sure if WFPB is just a vegan marketing ploy, trying to get you\nto be vegan without giving away the end goal.\n\nBut the \u201cwhole-food\u201d part does quite a bit toward our causal goals here,\nbecause seed oils are not a whole food.\n\nThe simple rule of cutting seed oils and processed food (which contains seed\noils) out of course does much more work than \u201cis it animal based?\u201d\n\nBut the \u201cno dead animals\u201d rule cuts out most of the atrocious linoleic acid\nsources that you can get from animal sources, such as chicken and bacon.\n\nPretty much the worst thing you can eat on WFPB is nuts, which are high in\nlinoleic acid despite being \u201cwhole.\u201d But unless you happen to binge on nuts\nall the time, chances are that you\u2019ll drastically lower your linoleic acid\nintake.\n\nThe culture and common canon of WFPB is also both low-fat and low-protein,\nmeaning that if you just follow their main gurus, you\u2019ll be good on that\nfront.\n\nSeems like a pretty good deal: WFPB gets a lot more things right than the more\nmorally oriented \u201cis it an animal product?\u201d rule.\n\nStill, there are quite a few false negatives: it cuts out all beef, lamb, and\ndairy, many of which are great and not at all at the root of obesity.\n\nIt also seems like long-term vegans/WFPB people become very skinny and\nsarcopenic to an unhealthy degree. I don\u2019t know if this is because they\nrestrict protein for way too long. But it\u2019s something I\u2019d watch out for if I\nwas to pursue this diet.\n\n##\n\nLow-carb / Standard American Keto\n\nOh boy, this is my favorite! What I call Standard American Keto is how I\ngained 100lbs after first losing it.\n\nWhat is Standard American Keto? It\u2019s not a real \u201cclassic ketogenic diet\u201d but\nwhat you\u2019d find being recommended for fitness/lifestyle fat loss purposes by\npopular keto diet gurus.\n\nIt\u2019s much higher in protein than a real ketogenic diet, and it\u2019s also\ntypically high in bacon, and often nuts. While most keto gurus probably\nwouldn\u2019t tell you to use seed oils, linoleic acid is rarely on their radar,\nand any critique of ad-lib daily bacon & chicken is perceived as vegan\npropaganda.\n\nThis diet avoids most literal seed oils if you cook at home, I\u2019ve yet to meet\na ketoer who cooks in seed oils.\n\nBut it quickly falls apart at restaurants. I mostly ate the chicken salads\nwhen I went to restaurants, and the dressings are all based on soybean oil.\n\nThese diets also often encourage nuts, which are high in fat, mostly\npolyunsaturated except macadamia. Nuts & cheese was my go to snack at the\noffice when on SAK, and it made me ravenous.\n\nThe SAK is also improbably high in the animal-based sources of linoleic acid:\nbacon is celebrated, as is roasted chicken, especially the fatty parts.\n\nFor our second causal factor: by definition, a keto diet is very low in carbs,\nso they\u2019re restricting 1 macro. That\u2019s likely the reason why keto works so\nwell for maybe 15-30% of people. They just needed to restrict any 1 macro, and\ntheir metabolism was fixed, or at least in remission if they were jacked up on\nlinoleic acid.\n\nBut for the people who need to restrict 2 macros, like myself, this \u201cfitness\noriented\u201d high-protein version of keto is terrible news, and can often even\nlead to weight gain, or just weight stalls.\n\nThese people will usually aggressively denounce anyone promoting a low-protein\ndiet as vegan propaganda. I got banned from r/keto for just mentioning that I\nwas doing low-protein. (I am unbanned, apparently! Maybe it expires after a\nyear?)\n\n##\n\nCarnivore\n\nCarnivore fares significantly better than Standard American Keto, which is\nlikely why it works for a number of people for whom regular keto didn\u2019t work.\nIt\u2019s also much simpler to explain, and simplicity is a huge benefit: it\nreduces potential for error, but it also reduces mental overhead for those new\nto the diet.\n\nWhat does carnivore exclude that SAK allows? Nuts, salads & dressings at\nrestaurants. Depending on the sort of carnivore you do (there is no One\nOfficial definition) it also excludes dairy, and cheese especially seems ultra\nobesogenic even among high-protein foods.\n\nThe downside is a much larger number of false negatives: it disallows pretty\nmuch everything except meat/maybe eggs/very maybe dairy, depending on which\nvariant you choose.\n\nInterestingly, there\u2019s also a cultural trend where most U.S. carnivores mainly\nchoose beef. This isn\u2019t usually canon, and exceptions are made, but it\u2019s very\ncommon to hear (U.S.) carnivores say that they \u201cfeel best on beef,\u201d and most\nlong-term carnivores choose beef as their primary meat.\n\nStill, a lot of carnivores post daily pictures of their bacon breakfast, and\ntheir eggs cooked in bacon grease. Roast chicken is also not uncommon. So it\nreally depends on your own interpretation of \u201ccarnivore\u201d if you\u2019ll get the\nlinoleic acid part very right or very wrong.\n\nThe swamping part is almost impossible to get right. Of course you\u2019ll get\nalmost 0 carbs, since you can only eat animal products, and most versions of\ncarnivore don\u2019t allow dairy, which is the major animal source of carbs\n(lactose).\n\nBut it is also both highly encouraged to eat high protein on carnivore, and,\nin practice, nearly impossible to avoid.\n\nEven if you only eat fatty ground beef (say 80% lean / 20% fat) and ribeye\nsteaks with slices of butter, you\u2019ll be eating an extremely high protein diet\nby any measure.\n\nTo get 3,000kcal/day from ribeye steaks, the TDEE of pretty much any adult\nman, you\u2019d need to eat 2-4lbs of ribeye, depending on the fat content. That\nmeans you\u2019re getting 200-500g of protein, by far more than anybody needs.\n\nYou can add butter to every steak, which I did when I tried carnivore for 90\ndays - but that\u2019ll merely turn it from a bizarrely-high-protein diet into a\nsuper-high-protein diet.\n\nA single pound of fatty beef contains roughly 80-100g of protein, which is way\ntoo much for any sort of protein restriction.\n\nAnd if you restrict yourself to, say, half a pound of beef per day, where are\nyou going to get the remaining 2,500kcal from? Butter, beef tallow, heavy\ncream (if allowed)?\n\nThere\u2019s a sub-category of carnivore called Keto AF, coined by Amber O\u2019Hearn.\nHer website is aptly named \u201cmostly fat\u201d and it promotes a carnivore variant of\nonly beef, mostly consisting of the beef fat with only an adequate amount of\nlean meat.\n\nBut while the \u201cwhoa, I get to eat all the steak & bacon I want?!\u201d of Standard\nAmerican Carnivore might sound great to maybe 20-30% of the population, the\n\u201cyou can\u2019t even eat a whole steak, and most of your food will be beef\ntrimmings\u201d version is much less \u201clion\u201d and manly sounding.\n\nMy own diet ex150 is sort of a version of Keto AF: in trying Amber\u2019s version,\nI couldn\u2019t stomach all the beef fat, so I substituted heavy cream instead. I\ntolerate dairy exceptionally well, much better than the beef fat. I\u2019m also not\ntotally avoiding plants, but I use them as seasoning/for flavor, typically\nlimiting them to 60g of green vegetables & 80g of tomato sauce per day, mostly\nto soak up the excess beef fat and butter from cooking.\n\nBoth Keto AF and ex150 get both our causal factors right, but they\u2019re also\nboth extremely limiting. You\u2019re not just down to \u201canimal products,\u201d you\u2019re\ndown to literally 3-4 different types of foods that are allowed: beef, beef\nfat, butter(, heavy cream).\n\n##\n\nPaleo\n\nPaleo was huge when I was in college, and I followed it for a long time.\nUnfortunately, while it put the extreme acid reflux I developed in my early\n20s into remission, I never lost any weight on it.\n\nThere are various different types of Paleo described by the various gurus like\nMark Sisson (\u201cPrimal\u201d), Robb Wolf, and others.\n\nI seem to remember one definition from then going something like this:\n\nEat lean meats, fruits & vegetables, nuts & seeds.\n\nUnfortunately, this is almost entirely wrong by our 2 causal criteria. Let\u2019s\nbreak it down:\n\n  * Lean meat: great advice for monogastric animals (pork/chicken), terrible advice for beef and other ruminants. Unnecessarily avoids a lot of ruminant fat, which is a cornerstone of pretty much any healthy diet.\n\n  * Fruits: fine if you\u2019re going High Carb, Low Fat, Low Protein, bad otherwise.\n\n  * Vegetables: mostly orthogonal for green/non-starchy vegetables, starchy vegetables same as fruit.\n\n  * Nuts & seeds: terrible except for macadamias, since most nuts & seeds are chock-full of linoleic acid.\n\nPaleo was very popular with CrossFitters at the time, and as a budding guy in\nmy 20s I obviously did & followed CrossFit. I remember videos of Chris\nSpealler, a prominent CrossFit \u201cFire Breather\u201d and one-time \u201c100 pull-ups in a\nrow\u201d performer, going into Whole Foods to buy & eat almond butter with a\nspoon.\n\nSuffice to say, I think that Paleo is pretty terrible in retrospect. It steers\nus away from ruminant fat, one of the best sources of energy available.\n\nAnother big downside is that Paleo pretty much prevents dairy. For me\npersonally, dairy is the ultimate superfood. I\u2019ve never lost weight without a\nsignificant part of dairy fat in my diet. Like ruminant fat, it is the\nultimate inert energy source, and unlike ruminant fat, I can digest near-\ninfinite amounts of it.\n\nWhen it comes to our second rule, \u201cno swamping,\u201d Paleo doesn\u2019t explicitly say,\nbut pretty much prevents you from doing this correctly. \u201cLean meats\u201d are\nusually high-protein meats. You could, of course, eat an extremely small meal\nof lean meat to restrict your protein, but nobody on Paleo has likely ever\ndone this.\n\nYou also can\u2019t really pick between energy and carbs on Paleo, unless you turn\nit into the potato diet or something. Nuts & seeds are very fatty, and even\n\u201clean meats\u201d are probably not entirely chicken breast.\n\nAny version that fulfilled our 2 causal rules would be such an extreme and\nbizarre version of Paleo that nobody would recognize it as such.\n\n##\n\nMediterranean Diet\n\nNow we\u2019re getting into diets I haven\u2019t tried personally, but I wanted to\ninclude some others just for reference.\n\nThe Mediterranean Diet was infamously invented by an American on vacation, and\nnobody in the Mediterranean has ever eaten it. It\u2019s a fun hobby of mine to\nwatch Spaniards, Italians, Greeks, and other natives of the Mediterranean\nreact to this diet in wonder.\n\nTo quote Wikipedia:\n\nThis approach [the Mediterranean Diet] emphasizes a plant-based diet, focusing\non unprocessed cereals, legumes, vegetables, and fruits. It also includes\nmoderate consumption of fish, dairy products (mostly cheese and yogurt), and a\nlow amount of red meat.\n\nI\u2019ve spent a number of vacations in Spain, Italy, and Greece, and I can tell\nyou that I haven\u2019t had a single cereal or legume in any of those countries. I\nsuppose paella and risotto have rice, but they use white rice.\n\nVegetables are served, but as sides to the main dish - red meat. These people\neat more pork than all of Congress combined, and they eat so much fatty cheese\nthat even I had to wave the white flag. Oh, and they just straight up eat\nanimal fat as a delicacy.\n\nBeef is a bit more rare there, but just because it\u2019s expensive. The Italians\nabsolutely have steak dishes like Bistecca alla Fiorentina and they love veal.\n\nOverall, I don\u2019t think you would have as easy a time as a vegan in any of\nthese countries as you would in the U.S. People would likely laugh at you if\nyou declared you don\u2019t eat animal products.\n\nDo they eat fish? Sure. But they eat way more meat than fish even on the\ncoasts.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the lardo?\u201d wonders the Italian.\n\nLardo. If the word sounds familiar...\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the Jamon Iberico?\u201d asks the Spaniard.\n\nJamon Iberico\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the gyros?\u201d cries the Greek.\n\nGyros. You can tell how lean it is by the thick, glistening shine.\n\nThat said, how does the Mediterranean Diet, as envisioned by Wikipedia/Ancel\nKeys, fare against our 2 criteria of obesity?\n\nIt actually does pretty well, if you go by the book. The Mediterranean Diet is\nbasically a watered-down whole-foods, plant-based diet, allowing for some\nfish, some red meat, and some dairy.\n\nThat means there\u2019s going to be little linoleic acid from animal products, and\nit\u2019s also not exactly encouraging you to cook in seed oils.\n\nOn the other hand, from what I\u2019ve seen, the fear of saturated fat is so\noverwhelming that they end up defaulting to seed oils, at least over butter or\nother animal fat sources.\n\nOlive oil is the end-all, be-all for Mediterranean Diet types, but since\n50-80% of all olive oil world wide is adulterated with seed oils, and even\ngenuine olive oil is 8-20% linoleic acid depending on the olives used & the\nprocessing, it\u2019s a bit less than optimal.\n\nStill, it\u2019s likely going to be much better than the Standard American Diet, or\neven - gasp! - many variants of Standard American Keto.\n\nOn the swamping front, both fat and protein are somewhat discouraged. There\nisn\u2019t much fat or protein in \u201cunprocessed cereals, legumes, vegetables, and\nfruits\u201d and so you\u2019ll have to get the entirety of your fat, and the majority\nof your protein, from the \u201calso ran\u201d group.\n\nOverall, the Med does quite well on the swamping front. If you actually chose\nolive oil, or no oil, or ignored that part and just used butter, you\u2019d likely\nfare quite well on it.\n\nThis is pretty ironic, given that the main goal of the Mediterranean Diet is\nto avoid saturated fat - which isn\u2019t implicated at all in obesity.\n\n##\n\nDASH diet\n\nDASH is a silly acronym for a bureaucrat \u201chealth\u201d diet that I\u2019ve never seen an\nactual person do, ever.\n\nThe DASH diet is rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy\nfoods. It includes meat, fish, poultry, nuts, and beans, and is limited in\nsugar-sweetened foods and beverages, red meat, and added fats.\n\nSo it\u2019s basically the exact same as the Mediterranean Diet. I don\u2019t even know\nwhy they bothered making an acronym. Are grains the same as cereals?\n\nInterestingly:\n\n2\u20133 servings of fats and oils\n\nAnd they\u2019re discouraging saturated fats. So unless you had access to the 20%\nof non-adulterated olive oil, and used that exclusively, they\u2019re recommending\nyou consume 2-3 servings of seed oils per day. I suppose you could eat a whole\navocado instead, too.\n\nStill, precarious: the entire balance for our causal factor #1 depends on how\nyou interpret/act on this one line.\n\nOverall, the DASH diet is a carbon copy of the Med and therefore scores\nsimilarly. Except it\u2019s less sympathetic.\n\n(Seriously, I\u2019ve never, ever met anyone who\u2019s tried it.)\n\n##\n\nZone diet\n\nThe Zone diet was very popular with the CrossFit crowd before Paleo kind of\ntook over. Many tried to combine the two approaches.\n\nThe Zone diet is based on a book of mostly junk \u201cscience\u201d and has pretty much\nexactly 1 principle: you need to keep your macronutrient distribution in a\ncertain \u201czone\u201d and that zone is: 40% carbs, 30% fats, 30% protein. As a\nsecondary factor, it recommends low-glycemic index carbs and MUFAs over other\nfats.\n\nThere was a huge debate when CrossFitters abandoned the Zone diet and migrated\nto Paleo, and I remember one funny interview: a famous CrossFitter interviewed\nBarry Sears, the inventor of the Zone diet, and asked him a hypothetical\nquestion: would it be healthier to eat a Twinkie-style diet with Zone macros,\nor a Paleo-style diet of whole foods, but with a \u201cwrong\u201d macro distribution?\n\nSears enthusiastically recommended the \u201cZone-balanced\u201d Twinkie diet.\n\nI haven\u2019t heard anyone mention the Zone diet in over a decade, and it seems\nthey now mostly sell diet candy bars, similar to Atkins. Honestly, the\ningredients on those candy bars aren\u2019t even particularly bad compared to\nothers.\n\nBut let\u2019s evaluate the zone: it\u2019s almost entirely orthogonal to linoleic acid,\nalthough apparently MUFAs are preferred, but I couldn\u2019t tell if to SFAs or to\nPUFAs. And it mandates swamping as its Prime Directive.\n\nOverall, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much behind the Zone diet. You might\naccidentally be successful if you avoided PUFAs on it and you were ok with\nheavy swamping, which few obese people are.\n\n##\n\nVolumetrics diet\n\nThis has got to be the dumbest idea I\u2019ve ever heard.\n\nIt\u2019s all about volume; lose weight by filling up on low-calorie, nutrient-\ndense foods\n\nYou know what has nutrients in it? CALORIES! All the macronutrients are full\nof cArOliEs. So a diet can - by definition - not be low-cAloRiE and nutrient-\ndense at the same time.\n\nI got news for ya: just eat sawdust & cardboard. Heck, why eat? Just fast!\n\nMy own dietary approach is the literal opposite of this: heavy cream is the\nleast calorie dense meal I eat. Why would you fill yourself with largely non-\nfoods? Your body\u2019s not that stupid, it won\u2019t \u201cstop being hungry\u201d just because\nyou bloat yourself up like a balloon. This is easy enough to try, eat\nexclusively non-caloric foods like salad and you\u2019ll know what I\u2019m talking\nabout.\n\nYou could actually have success on this diet, but it would be a mere\ncoincidence: like \u201cis it an animal product?\u201d the volume or energy density of a\nfood is entirely orthogonal to both linoleic acid and swamping.\n\n##\n\nAccidental Success\n\nAs you can see, many of these diets will lead many people to accidental\nsuccess. The heuristics they used often had almost nothing to do with their\nsuccess factors, it was the luck of the draw (they didn\u2019t require something\ntheir heuristic didn\u2019t cover) or they intuitively preferred a sub-variant\nthat, while not specified by the diet, happened to solve their problems.\n\nHCLFLP is all the rage on r/SaturatedFat right now, and it\u2019s basically WFPB +\nlean beef. Many people there read all the vegan books, discard the propaganda,\nand just skip straight to the recipe section.\n\nAll the low-fat diets are fine if you avoid linoleic acid. They tend to be\nlow-protein as well, if not per prescription, because people who like low-fat\nare vegans and vegans hate protein.\n\nThe high-fat diets are actually more dangerous, I think: if you eat 80% fat,\nyou only need to get a few things wrong to massively overconsume linoleic\nacid. Making bacon or other fatty pork a staple is enough. Eating restaurant\nsalad dressing a few times a week is enough. Nuts.\n\nAnd people who like high-fat diets also tend to love protein, so while they\nmight be restricting carbs, almost all of them will be swamping fat + protein.\n\n##\n\nAs Simple as Possible, but not Simpler\n\nSimplicity is a virtue. If you have to explain a diet by starting at\nbiochemistry and reminding your interlocutor of what double bonds are, and how\nredox balance works in the mitochondria, there might just be a slight\napprehension to trying your diet.\n\nOn the other hand, not everything can be simplified further. Eventually,\nsimplifying a signal will induce loss - think of old low quality music files,\nif you\u2019re old enough. To save on disk space, these compressed the audio too\nmuch. This caused them to lose important information and the music sounded\nterrible. Many modern music files are lossless, meaning they only compress\nenough to save space, but stop just short of losing audible information.\n\nDiets are a bit like this. I could give you a one-word diet description, but\nit likely wouldn\u2019t capture the entirety of the concepts.\n\n  * plant-based (allows seed oils, huge false negative rate)\n\n  * animal-based (allows bacon/chicken, huge false negative rate)\n\n  * low-fat (doesn\u2019t specify which fat, technically allows high-protein swamping)\n\n  * low-carb/keto (doesn\u2019t specify which fat, likely high-protein out of necessity)\n\nThe best answer isn\u2019t nearly as simple. For one, you\u2019ll have to understand\nwhat fatty acids are, and PUFAs, and linoleic acid, and how the food chain\nworks (soybean/corn \u2192 animals) and what monogastric vs. ruminant animals are,\nand you probably need to understand why swamping is a problem, which involves\nthe TCA/Krebs cycle and distinguishing individual amino acids..\n\nBut then, hopefully, if your 2 causal factors are indeed necessary &\nsufficient, you can create the optimal diet: no false negatives, and no false\npositives. This should ensure success, but also prevent you from cutting out\nanything you don\u2019t need to cut out, making dietary choice much wider and more\nsustainable for many people who e.g. couldn\u2019t stick to carnivore or just\npotatoes for the rest of their lives.\n\nIn a sense, we just need to eat the refined, processed food our grandparents\nate - but take the linoleic acid out of the food supply.\n\nMaybe we\u2019ll find out that these 2 are not enough, and then the \u201creal\u201d optimal\ndiet will become even more complex.\n\nBut I\u2019ll take efficacy over simplicity any time.\n\n17 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n1 Restack\n\n17\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Evaluating diets: why most don't work, for most people, most of the time\n\nwww.exfatloss.com\n\n57\n\nShare\n\n57 Comments\n\nKarsten GApr 15Liked by Experimental Fat Loss1.*they intuitively preferred a\nsub-variant that, while not specified by the diet, happened to solve their\nproblems*I think people need to try out everything until they find their\nproblem.It looks that for people who do not have success with one way or\nsuddenly gain weight back etc. That they might have a another problem that was\nnot adressed yet. Or that noticed they can't process \"xyz\" properly.Sure\npeople can loose weight now knowing what to avoid. They may get healthier,\nhopefully. But unless they fix the issue which isn't always possible by not\neating something in my opinion. They might be just as broken afterwards. But\nnow they are at least thin, right?So the spiral begins again or they follow\nthe diet until it does not work anymore. And than get fat again.So adding\nanother step of fixing your body might be more important than choosing diet\nalone.Maybe telling people how not to get sick is better? (i know its that\neasy ;P)2.*as much as necessary, as little as possible* (hope it translates\nwell)The best explanation is the one you can easily teach children (elemantary\nschool age).I think most adults who are 'broken' for a long time will never\nrecover from it. They will always somehow need to control food/diet etc. At\nworst they will teach their kids all the wrong things. So if you are able to\nteach children what to look out for or even avoid things than you are on the\nwinning team.Otherwise most people who are \"healthy\" or not acutally sick/fat\njust won't care. I feel explaining things more detailed should be left for\nthose interested in it. For the majority of people a small, easy to understand\nflyer that can be read within less than 5 minutes is all i can see to be\nhonest. The rest is just noise.3.I want to expand this part but i don't have\ntime now.I know this post was about diets. But anyway i think it does fit.What\ni miss here is behavior and the pychosogical side of things. Which is in my\nopinion almost as important or even more important than diet alone.Without\nfixing your relationship with 'food/yourself/others/anything really' it almost\ndoes not matter what you eat (i.e. emotion/stress/eating patterns/timing\netc.).I especially want to include those \"branches/groups\" within any diet\nthat will recreate a SAD-diet but with low/high-carb/fat stuff.They recreate\nthe same shit that made them fat. But now it is xyz-free. So its good now\n(taps forehead). They still shove 15 xyz-free muffin(insert anything here)\ninto their mouth every day.They have not changed at all. How do they expect\nchange when they do the same thing.Maybe this explains my view a bit better.\nThey never moved on, they only look in a different direction.Yes, it does not\naffect everyone.\\---I might have lost track while writing this.
