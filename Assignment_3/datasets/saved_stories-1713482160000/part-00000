But I hit the limit on the first 20-30\nminutes after testing it. :) I need much bigger limit as I have more than 5k\nstars. That can't be easily organized in a few lists.Anyway, I like to collect\ninteresting software projects and sort them in categories and lists so this\nfeature is really great. I already got hooked and can't imagine living without\nit. Good job GitHub-ers. \ud83d\udc4d  \n---  \n  \nBeta Was this translation helpful?

I estimate I would need around 50 categories\nto organize my ~500 likes. It's unusable with only 16. Will have to leave off\norganizing until this is increased.Also the lists should probably have their\nown page if the limit is increased. Or some way to pin x lists. I can see why\nthey might have been limited to this amount because they're all shown on the\nstars page and they occupy a huge space (they also have way too much padding\nimo).  \n---  \n  \nBeta Was this translation helpful?
