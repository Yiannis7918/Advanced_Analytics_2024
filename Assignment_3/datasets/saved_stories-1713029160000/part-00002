I loved Brian\u2019s\nidea of periodically cutting away from the narrative to offer little lessons,\nand we both felt that manipulating physical props on a soundstage, rather than\nusing computer animation, would be the most compelling way of demonstrating\ntypographic principles.\n\nThe three resulting segments, titled These Are Letters! and heralded by an\nimpish jingle, are the result. For the chapter about optical illusions, I\nwrote and storyboarded ten different examples, though in the end we whittled\nthese down to a leaner set of four. Since a number of people who teach design\nhave suggested that we manufacture these for use in the classroom, I thought\nI\u2019d take the more direct approach, and make them available as a free download,\nas a PDF that can be printed on transparencies. This also felt like a good\nmoment to publish the six additional lessons that didn\u2019t make the cut, which\nare illustrated below. Whether you\u2019re teaching typography, studying it, or\njust giving letters a closer look for the first time, I hope you\u2019ll find these\nuseful. \u2014JH\n\nNo. 1. Type design is a battle with optical illusions, which we only win\nthrough a complete surrender. We convince the eye to see things clearly not by\ncreating rational drawings, but through irrational ones, by introducing\nstrange distortions that outwit the eye: to shape not what we see, but what we\nthink we see.\n\nEven the alphabet\u2019s simplest goals begin with some unexpected accommodations.\nMaking all the letters appear the same height means drawing round characters\nto be measurably taller than flat ones, to counter our physiological tendency\nto see circles as smaller than squares of the same height. In a typeface,\nletters that are round at the top or bottom (such as this C) will need to\nproject beyond the height of the flat letters (such as T), by an amount that\ntype designers call \u201covershoot.\u201d Overshoot will apply throughout the character\nset, to the lowercase, numbers, symbols, and punctuation \u2014 and devilishly, it\nwon\u2019t always have the same measurement. It\u2019s not uncommon for the overshoot of\nan S and an O to differ, dictated only by how things appear to the eye.\n\nNo. 2. Our misperception about circles and squares extends to triangles, too:\nletters whose strokes converge into a point are prone to appear smaller than\nthey actually are. So type designers customarily apply some degree of\novershoot to diagonal letters like A, V, and W, and often, if the design calls\nfor especially sharp corners, the acute points of the letters N and M as well.\n\nNo. 3. Another thing we consistently misjudge is balance. This may be a\nvestige of how humans have evolved to process the physical environment,\nintuitively recognizing that remote objects appear smaller than those nearby.\nApplied to typography, it means that making a letterform appear equally\nbalanced requires drawing it to be measurably smaller on top. These\nexpectations about \u201cnatural balance\u201d are at work in letters like B, E, and S,\nwhich are visibly smaller above and larger below \u2014 and even in the letter H,\nwhich in order to appear symmetrical, needs a crossbar that\u2019s just above\ncenter.\n\nNo. 4. Curiously, a letterform\u2019s construction can also influence how we\nperceive its equilibrium. Take the letter A, whose most basic recipe is \u201ca\ndelta with a horizontal bar in the center.\u201d By rotating this letter about the\ncenter of the crossbar, we can see just how far below center this waistline\nreally is. This is because perception is subject to context, and for the bar\nof the A, what we perceive as its relevant context isn\u2019t the entire letter,\nit\u2019s the much smaller region that\u2019s inside the delta.\n\nNo. 5. Both kinds of typographic balance combine unexpectedly in the letters E\nand F, whose center arms appear identical, but in fact almost never align.\nFollowing what we know about natural balance, the arm of the E will be\npositioned just above center, in order to appear equidistant from the two\nother strokes. But owing to its relevant context, the arm of the F will be\ncentered not on the height of the character, but in the void between the\nunderside of the top stroke, and the empty bottom of the letter \u2014 making it\nlower than the arm of the E, its fraternal twin. Often, the arrangement of the\nF is a compromise between what its own construction suggests, and its need for\ncompatibility with the frequently adjacent letter E.\n\nNo. 6. The simple letter T conceals one of typography\u2019s great paradoxes: that\nlines appear thicker when oriented horizontally than vertically. Type\ndesigners call this property \u201ccontrast,\u201d and because it behaves differently in\ndifferent directions, it\u2019s said to be \u201canisotropic.\u201d To create letterforms\nthat appear to have a consistent weight throughout, a type designer will make\nsure that vertical strokes are measurably thicker than horizontal ones;\ndiagonal strokes, therefore, will fall somewhere in between.\n\nNo. 7. Anisotropic contrast affects not only weight, but also dimension: just\nas we perceive horizontal strokes to be thicker than they really are, we\nperceive horizontal distances to be longer than they actually are. To create\nwhat appears to be a perfect circle or a perfect square, a type designer will\ncreate a shape that\u2019s measurably narrower than it is tall. Looking at the\nletter O, we can see two effects of anisotropic contrast at once: in its\nnormal orientation, the stroke weight becomes steadily thinner as it reaches\nthe top and bottom of the letter, and the letterform itself is taller than it\nis wide.\n\nNo. 8. Complicating the way we perceive weight is the \u201ccalligraphic bias\u201d\nthat\u2019s implicit in the Latin alphabet itself. The very shapes of our letters\nare the product of the broad-edged pen, held at an oblique angle in the right\nhand, which, as it moves rightward, produces thin upstrokes and thick\ndownstrokes. This pattern of thins and thicks is apparent in many of the\ntypefaces we read every day, but it\u2019s also imperceptibly fossilized in even\nthe most evenly-weighted design. Looking at a mirror image of the letter A\nreveals that its left leg is subtly lighter than its right, a necessary\nmaneuver to satisfy our subliminal expectations about weight \u2014 all the\nconsequence of ancient right-handed scribes.\n\nNo. 9. To see all of these phenomena at work, look no further than the letter\nS: it only takes viewing the letter from a different angle to reveal all the\nsleight-of-hand that goes into making it appear balanced. Turning the S\nclockwise reveals the different proportions of its top and bottom halves, a\nnecessity to maintain natural balance. In this orientation, the ends of the\nstrokes appear to flare outward, a consequence of the anisotropic contrast\nthat causes weights to thicken as they approach verticality.\n\nNo. 10. Looking at its mirror image reveals an additional illusion: that the S\nis considerably thicker in the middle than above or below, a consequence of\nthe calligraphic bias that expects downward strokes to be the heaviest.\nNowhere is this more dramatic than in its lower left quarter, where the\nletter\u2019s heavy spine rapidly thins out as it approaches the baseline, the\ncombined effects of anisotropic contrast and calligraphic bias that are both\nundetectable in its normal orientation. \u2014JH\n\nDownload the PDF of these illustrations\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Pinterest\n  * Facebook\n  * Email\n  * Link\n  * 5 Nov 19\n\n  * Learning\n  * Netflix Abstract\n  * Optical Illusions\n  * Technique\n\n# Illusionary Typefaces:\n\n## Gotham Bold\n\nTo best illustrate the effects of these typographic illusions, we used the no-\nnonsense Gotham typeface. Take a tour of its character set to see all the\nstrategies that even simple letterforms must use to outwit the eye.\n\n## Ideal Sans Semibold\n\nIdeal Sans takes every opportunity to thwart geometric dogma, containing few\nstraight lines and fewer symmetries \u2014 decisions that are only revealed when\nexamining the typeface from unusual perspectives.\n\n## Landmark Shadow\n\nTo produce the simple effect of evenly-weighted dimensionality, the extruded\ndrop shadows of the Landmark typeface take great liberties with the design and\nmathematics of the alphabet.\n\n## Obsidian\n\nThe Obsidian typeface varies the strategies it uses to create visually\nconsistent facets over a wide range of forms: lines and curves, plain and\nsimple shapes, and gestures large and small.\n\n# Typography for NYC Pride\n\nTwo H&Co typefaces now grace the inclusive new identity for NYC Pride.\n\n  * Branding\n  * Gotham\n  * Knockout\n\nIt feels timely to celebrate H&Co\u2019s partnership with Lippincott to help\nreimagine the brand identity for NYC Pride, the trademark event of Heritage of\nPride, with a recognized legacy of unity, protest, advocacy, and fun. Our\nparent company, Monotype, provided two typefaces, Knockout and Gotham, from\nthe Hoefler&Co library.\n\nKnockout and Gotham lend a bold and direct yet warm appearance to the new\nvisual identity, aligning with the group\u2019s new brand purpose: \u201cTo inspire and\nempower every LGBTQIA person to proudly love and live their truth.\u201d H&Co is\nthrilled to see these two expressive typefaces working on behalf of this\ncause.\n\n40-plus years after the Stonewall Uprising in Greenwich Village, Heritage of\nPride had arrived at a crossroads of sorts. Formed in the aftermath of\nStonewall, the group\u2019s legacy is woven into the full sweep of the modern\nLGBTQIA+ movement. As the organizer of the iconic NYC Pride march, The Rally,\nand other marquee events, Heritage of Pride has seen it all\u2014from the early\ndays of proudly defiant public demonstration through all the challenges,\nvictories, and progress since.\n\nOver the years, however, the organization never settled on a single,\nconsistent brand identity for its centerpiece event, NYC Pride, choosing\ninstead to change the visuals in keeping with each year\u2019s theme.\n\nThe Heritage of Pride leadership team recognized it needed an enduring,\nresonant brand identity to help it drive equity and raise awareness around the\norganization\u2019s incredible impact. Lippincott eagerly came on board to help\nHeritage of Pride develop a new brand identity for NYC Pride that would\nreflect the organization\u2019s immense contributions to the LGBTQIA+ movement and\nthe crucial role it continues to play. H&Co was honored to be a part of this\nproject.\n\nThe goal of the rebrand was to create a feeling of inclusivity and capture the\nspirit and importance of the organization\u2019s home city. This is New York after\nall, and the significance of the city and its people to the LGBTQIA+ movement\ncannot be understated. Fittingly, the Heritage of Pride team chose two\ntypefaces with strong NYC roots to represent the brand: Gotham\u00ae and Knockout\u00ae,\nboth from H&Co and now part of the Monotype Library. More on them in a moment.\n\nThe project began with a new positioning that would act as a foundation for\nthe brand and experience. The new brand purpose, to inspire and empower every\nLGBTQIA+ person to proudly love and live their truth, speaks to NYC Pride\u2019s\nroots in protest, and the annual celebration\u2019s power in unifying and\nadvocating for its community.\n\nThe new visual identity is built around an inclusive, community-centric and\ntruly identifiable flag emblem\u2014one that draws from history and captures the\nfull range of today\u2019s movement. The iconic Pride flag, which has evolved into\na universal symbol of safety, community, and allyship, is at the center of it\nall, capturing the organization\u2019s spirit of celebration and activism. The flag\nsubtly features the letters \u2018NYC\u2019, and features an adaptive gradient,\nproviding storytelling flexibility and inclusivity for different subgroups\nwithin the LGBTQIA+ community.\n\nGotham and Knockout bring more than NYC street cred to the story. With its\nroots in the eclectic typography of 19th century broadsides, Knockout brings\nan enduring fighting spirit that honors the determination of Heritage of\nPride\u2019s decades-long push for equality and representation.\n\nThe unapologetically bold stature of Knockout perfectly counterbalances the\nfriendly openness of Gotham, a contemporary take on a style of sign lettering\nfound all over the streets of New York. Gotham\u2019s elemental forms were made to\nexpress as broad a range of voices as possible. The prominent use of Gotham\nCondensed Extra Black allows the organization to speak in a voice that is both\nbold and welcoming, assertive and inclusive. Heritage of Pride joins a long\nlist of prominent uses for Gotham, famously including the Obama campaign.\n\n\u201cI love seeing our typefaces put to use for such a meaningful cause and\norganization,\u201d said Sara Soskolne, Creative Type Director at Monotype.\n\u201cKnockout and Gotham are ideal choices to help tell the story of NYC Pride\u2019s\nhistory and mission of inclusivity while conveying that it\u2019s more than just an\nannual celebration\u2014it\u2019s a year-round commitment to equality.\u201d\n\nJenifer Lehker, Partner, Design at Lippincott, added, \u201cNYC Pride is recognized\nglobally as a beacon of safety, community and allyship, but also as a symbol\nof protest and activism. Monotype understood this and beautifully contributed\nto our cause with the Gotham and Knockout font families, both of which truly\nconvey the brand\u2019s spirit and legacy.\n\n\u201cPride began as a protest, and we wanted to capture a typographic voice\nreminiscent of bold, eye-catching posters used by protestors. Designed in NYC,\nKnockout and Gotham pay homage to the brand\u2019s roots, while providing the\nvisual boldness necessary to amplify the community\u2019s voices.\u201d\n\nThe fight for equality is never-ending, a fact that Heritage of Pride knows\nwell. H&Co hopes this new identity for NYC Pride catapults the organization\nforward into a new era of advocacy and activism, and H&Co is proud to play\neven a small role in that effort. \u2014MT\n\nTypefaces in the identity: Gotham and Knockout\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Pinterest\n  * Facebook\n  * Email\n  * Link\n\n  * Branding\n  * Gotham\n  * Knockout\n\n# Introducing Sagittarius\n\nA typeface with lightly-worn futurism, Sagittarius is equally at home among\nthe beauty and wellness aisles, or the coils of the warp core.\n\n  * Condensed\n  * Dictionaries\n  * Fashion\n  * Headlines\n  * Modular Letters\n  * New Releases\n  * Science\n  * Science Fiction\n\nTypeface designers spend a lot of time chasing down strange valences. We try\nto figure out what\u2019s producing that whiff of Art Deco, or that vaguely\nmilitaristic air, or what\u2019s making a once solemn typeface suddenly feel\ntongue-in-cheek. If we can identify the source of these qualities, we can\ncultivate them, and change the direction of the design; more often, we just\nextinguish them without mercy. Sometimes, we get the chance to follow a third\npath, which is how we arrived at our newest typeface, Sagittarius.\n\nDuring the development of Peristyle, our family of compact, high-contrast sans\nserifs, I often found myself unwittingly humming space-age pop songs. Nothing\nabout Peristyle\u2019s chic and elegant letterforms suggested the deadpan romp of\n\u201cThe Planet Plan\u201d by United Future Organization, let alone \u201cMusic To Watch\nSpace Girls By\u201d from the ill-advised (but delicious) Leonard Nimoy Presents\nMr. Spock\u2019s Music from Outer Space, but there they were. Something in the\nfonts was provoking an afterimage of the otherworldly, as if the typeface was\nsliding in and out of a parallel universe of high-tech spycraft and low-tech\nbrawls with rubber-masked aliens. It might have had something to do with a new\neyeglass prescription. But I liked the effect, and started thinking about\ncreating an alternate, space-age version of the typeface, one with a little\nmore funk, and a lot more fun.\n\nI wondered if softer edges, a measured dose of seventies retrofuturism, and\nsome proper draftsmanship might produce a typeface not only suitable for sci-\nfi potboilers, but for more serious projects, too: why not a line of skin care\nproducts, a fitness system, a high-end digital camera, or a music festival? I\nput a pin in the idea, wondering if there\u2019d ever be a project that called for\nequal parts sobriety and fantasy. And almost immediately, exactly such a\nproject appeared.\n\n## The Historical Dictionary of Science Fiction\n\nJesse Sheidlower is a lexicographer, a former Editor at Large for the Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary, and a longtime friend. He\u2019s someone who takes equal\npleasure in the words \u2018usufructuary\u2019 and \u2018megaboss,\u2019 and therefore a welcome\ncollaborator for the typeface designer whose love of the Flemish baroque is\nmatched by a fondness for alphabets made of logs. Jesse was preparing to\nlaunch The Historical Dictionary of Science Fiction, a comprehensive online\nresource dedicated to the terminology of the genre, whose combination of\nscholarship and joy was a perfect fit for the typeface I imagined. For\nlinguists, there\u2019d be well-researched citations to explain how the hitherto\nuninvented \u2018force field\u2019 and \u2018warp speed\u2019 came to enter the lexicon. For\nscience fiction fans, there\u2019d be definitive (and sometimes surprising)\nhistories of the argot of Stars both Trek and Wars. And for everyone, there\u2019d\nbe the pleasure of discovering science fiction\u2019s less enduring contributions,\nfrom \u2018saucerman\u2019 to \u2018braintape,\u2019 each ripe for a comeback. A moderated,\ncrowdsourced project, the dictionary is now online and growing every day.\nYou\u2019ll find it dressed in three font families from H&Co: Whitney ScreenSmart\nfor its text, Decimal for its navigational icons, and Sagittarius for its\nheadlines \u2014 with some of the font\u2019s more fantastical alternate characters\nturned on.\n\n## The New Typeface\n\nSagittarius is a typeface whose rounded corners and streamlined forms give it\na romantically scientific voice. In the interest of versatility, its\nletterforms make only oblique references to specific technologies, helping the\ntypeface remain open to interpretation. But for projects that need the full-\nthroated voice of science fiction, a few sets of digital accessories are\nincluded, which designers can introduce at their own discretion. There are\nalternate letters with futuristic pedigrees, from the barless A popularized by\nDanne & Blackburn\u2019s 1975 \u2018worm\u2019 logo for NASA, to a disconnected K recalling\nthe 1968 RCA logo by Lippincott & Margulies. A collection of digitally-\ninspired symbols are included for decorative use, from the evocative MICR\nsymbols of electronic banking, to the obligatory barcodes that forever haunt\nhuman\u2013machine interactions. More widely applicable are the font\u2019s arrows and\nmanicules, and the automatic substitutions that resolve thirty-four awkward\ncombinations of letters with streamlined ligatures.\n\nSagittarius takes its name from the constellation in the zodiac, and home to\nsome of astronomy\u2019s most inspiring discoveries. In 1977, a powerful radio\nsignal originating in the Sagittarius constellation was considered by many to\nbe the most compelling recorded evidence of extraterrestrial life. Thanks to\nan astronomer\u2019s enthusiastically penned comment, the 72-second transmission\nbecame known as the Wow! signal, and it galvanized support for one of\nscience\u2019s most affecting projects, the Search for Extraterrestrial\nIntelligence (seti). More recently, Sagittarius has been identified as the\nlocation of a staggering celestial discovery: a supermassive black hole, some\n44 million kilometers in diameter, in the Galactic Center of the Milky Way.\n\u2014JH\n\nSagittarius by H&Co.

What a wonderful\nand uplifting announcement this piece of typography gets to accompany: that\nthe formidable Senator Kamala Harris will join the presumptive Democratic\npresidential nominee in a bid for the White House.\n\nI can\u2019t remember an election in which so much attention (and speculation) has\nsurrounded the choice of a running mate, nor having such a large field of\neminently qualified candidates to choose from. A consequential decision at an\nunpredictable time, conducted under absolute secrecy, poses an interesting\ndilemma to the typographer: how do you create a logo without knowing for\ncertain what the words will say? Logos, after all, are meaningfully informed\nby the shapes of their letters, and a logo designed for an eisenhower will\nhardly work for a taft. The solution, naturally, involves the absurd\napplication of brute force: you just design all the logos you can think of,\nbased on whatever public information you can gather. Every credible suggestion\nspotted in an op-ed was added to the list that we designers maintained, and\nnot once did the campaign even hint at a preference for one name over another.\n\nWhile the press debated the merits of the candidates\u2019 backgrounds, my\ndiscussions concerned the shapes of their names. Short names versus long ones;\nnames that began with awkwardly-shaped letters; names with ornery kerning\npairs. Names whose letters aligned strangely with biden, disqualifying entire\ncategories of visual arrangement; names that run long, thanks to a W or M, or\nshort because of an I, or all three at once. \u2018Heterogrammatical\u2019 names, which\ncontain no repeating letters; names that are schnapps-words. One peculiar\nfeature of political design is that each logo is beholden to the others, which\nallows the campaign to safely prepare an identity that anticipates last-minute\ndevelopments. Another is how it affects the usual pattern of advocacy and\ncritique: recommending a logo that works for only a specific handful of\ncandidates, there\u2019s no way of truly knowing what calculus will inform the\nfeedback, because you never know if you\u2019re working with placebos. By\nnecessity, good political design is a rigorous, single-blind study.\n\nAs both a designer (second) and a citizen (first), I am immensely pleased with\nthe news, and enormously proud to have worked with Robyn and her team to\ncreate the typography that befits these two extraordinary public servants. \u2014JH\n\nJoe Biden for President: Official Campaign Website\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Pinterest\n  * Facebook\n  * Email\n  * Link\n  * 12 Aug 20\n\n  * Biden\n  * Decimal\n  * Logos\n  * Onomastics\n  * Politics\n  * The Presidency\n\n# Type Goes to the Emmys!\n\nThe episode of Abstract about typeface designer Jonathan Hoefler is nominated\nfor a 2020 Primetime Emmy Award\n\n  * Awards\n  * Cinema\n  * Documentary\n  * Netflix Abstract\n\nI\u2019m thrilled to discover that my episode of the Netflix original documentary\nseries Abstract: The Art of Design has been nominated for a 2020 Primetime\nEmmy Award for Outstanding Main Title Design. If ever there was a meaningful\ncategory for a typographer, this is it!\n\nDesigners know that typography plays a critical role in filmmaking, never more\nso than in a series like Abstract, and most especially in an episode devoted\nto typeface design. This is a documentary in which the visible typography of\nthe city is overlaid with typographic annotations, seamlessly segueing into an\nopening credit sequence that\u2019s used not merely to introduce the story, but to\nbegin telling it. I\u2019m overjoyed that this splendid piece of filmmaking has\nbeen singled out for recognition.\n\nWhile I had the privilege of contributing the most atomic raw materials to the\nmain titles, the nomination honors a sequence that\u2019s the work of the Abstract\nteam, beginning with Executive Producers Scott Dadich, Morgan Neville, and\nDave O\u2019Connor, Director Brian Oakes, Motion Graphics Producer Paula Chowles,\nCreative Director Allie Fisher, Motion Graphics Designer Anthony Zazzi, and\nComposers Timo Elliston and Brian Jones, to whom I am extraordinarily\ngrateful.

The hours we\u2019ve logged\nwith cookbooks, online recipes, woodworking plans, and patterns for sewing\nfacemasks has reminded us just how many fractions there are in the world \u2014 and\njust how inconvenient they are to typeset. We\u2019ve all seen instructions that\nbackslide into the occasional \u20181/2\u2019 where \u20181\u20442\u2019 was intended, as well as\ncountless improvisations for connecting whole numbers to their fractional\nparts. (The manuscript that reads \u20188-1/2\u2019 often produces \u20188-1\u20442\u2019 instead of\nthe desired \u201881\u20442,\u2019 a slippery typo that\u2019s hard to detect, and harder still to\nfix using a wholesale find-and-change.) In speaking with cookbook designers,\nwe\u2019ve come up with a new approach for typesetting fractions that we think\nmight make them easier to wrangle, and we\u2019ve baked this new mechanism directly\ninto the new Sentinel Pro fonts. You\u2019ll find more about how this works in the\n\u2018Smart Fractions\u2019 section of Sentinel\u2019s How to Use page, along with a few more\nautomated features to help make fine typography that much more attainable in a\nproduction workflow.\n\n## Sentinel Ornaments\n\nIn the early nineties, I fell in love with a set of nineteenth century\ndecorative printers\u2019 dashes that were reproduced in a journal article. I went\nabout faithfully digitizing them, as an exercise in understanding what made\nthem tick, but quickly discovered just how unforgiving digital outlines can be\nwhen it comes to capturing the charming idiosyncrasies of metal type. Reducing\nsome shapes to their underlying geometries made them sterile, but recording\ntheir every inconsistency made them awkward. Some shapes were so disfigured by\nthe effects of printing that it was difficult to guess what the original\ntypefounder had even intended. These ornaments have been my rainy day project\nfor the better part of thirty years, and their solution only recently came\ninto focus. I took the opportunity to prune the original set, and come up with\nnearly two hundred additional shapes in a sympathetic style. Their new form\nshares many of Sentinel\u2019s motifs, so I\u2019ve welcomed them into the family: these\nnew fonts, Sentinel Ornaments Bright and Dark, are available as a package, and\nalso included in Sentinel Pro. They\u2019re exactly what I\u2019d hoped for: not merely\na means to reproduce some handsome historical artifact, but a robust and well-\nappointed toolkit for creating new and more relevant kinds of typographic\ndecoration.\n\nMy thanks to the team at H&Co who contributed to this project, especially\nColin Ford who took on the challenge of constructing and painstakingly testing\nSentinel\u2019s new fraction feature, and Sara Soskolne who joined me on my mad\nodyssey into ornaments and manicules. Whether you\u2019re a designer who relies on\nSentinel already, or are taking an interest in the fonts for the first time, I\nhope the new Sentinel Pro will find a welcome home in your own font library.\n\u2014JH\n\nThe new Sentinel Pro, exclusively at H&Co.\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Pinterest\n  * Facebook\n  * Email\n  * Link\n  * 15 Jul 20\n\n  * Informational Typography\n  * New Releases\n  * ScreenSmart\n  * Sentinel\n  * Slab Serif\n  * Text Faces\n  * Web Fonts\n\n# Typography for Biden\n\nTwo H&Co typefaces, and a new typographic system designed for the campaign.\n\n  * Biden\n  * Decimal\n  * Mercury\n  * Politics\n  * The Presidency\n\nOn Independence Day, Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign began\nrolling out a new visual identity built on two typefaces by Hoefler&Co: the\nsans serif Decimal, and the seriffed Mercury Text. We could not be more proud\nto see our work support a campaign of nuanced thinking and decisive action, in\nthe critical election before us.\n\nWhen I was approached by Robyn Kanner, Senior Creative Advisor to Biden For\nPresident, she shared with me one of the campaign\u2019s most interesting\ncommunications challenges: its reliance on sophisticated and irreducible\nmessages, which would need the clarifying effects of typography. Kanner\ndescribed this in musical terms, talking about the ways in which rhythms and\nharmonic resolutions can shape the contours of a long lyric. For me, this\nresonated with the typography of America\u2019s revolutionary period, and its vogue\nfor capitalizing significant words: \u201cLife, Liberty and the pursuit of\nHappiness,\u201d as these unalienable rights are famously styled in The Declaration\nof Independence.\n\nWorking together, we came up with some guidelines for the campaign\u2019s\ntypography, which would help articulate thoughtful messages with attentive\ntypography. Words of action would be set in Decimal\u2019s declarative small\ncapitals, while the supporting syntax would rely on Mercury Text Grade Four.\nBoth fonts are considered and unobvious choices for a national campaign: less\nthan a year old, Decimal is a contemporary typeface, but one that\u2019s rooted in\nthe same traditions as our most enduring designs, while the time-tested\nMercury is a stalwart but adventurous text face designed to take on any\nchallenge. Both choices feel especially apt.\n\nThe words above come from the Vice President Biden\u2019s address on the Fourth of\nJuly, a surprisingly candid assessment of the unfinished American project. We\nat Hoefler&Co are honored that our work is helping give form to these ideas,\nand serving a campaign of optimism, determination, and ideas. \u2014JH\n\nMore at Business Insider\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Pinterest\n  * Facebook\n  * Email\n  * Link\n  * 7 Jul 20\n\n  * Biden\n  * Decimal\n  * Mercury\n  * Politics\n  * The Presidency\n\n# Text for Proofing Fonts\n\nA farewell to The Quick Brown Fox.\n\nby Jonathan Hoefler\n\nIllustration by Lydia Hill\n\n  * Breaking Rules\n  * Found Poetry\n  * Learning\n  * Process\n  * Puzzles\n  * Technique\n  * Words\n\nType designers love a good pangram.

Sometime in the early nineties, I whiled\naway an entire afternoon in a San Francisco caf\u00e9 coming up with a bunch of my\nown, honoring typeface designers (mix Zapf with Veljovi\u0107 and get quirky\nB\u00e9ziers), and philosophers (you go tell that vapid existentialist quack Freddy\nNietzsche that he can just bite me, twice), and the uplifting grace of a\ncosmos in balance (Wham! Volcano erupts fiery liquid death onto ex-jazzbo\nKenny G.) Pangrams are unctuous little brain ticklers, challenging to concoct,\ndroll to read, and immensely popular for presenting fonts.\n\nI find them singularly useless in type design, and I don\u2019t use them in my\nwork.\n\nContinues...\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Pinterest\n  * Facebook\n  * Email\n  * Link\n  * 19 May 20\n\n  * Breaking Rules\n  * Found Poetry\n  * Learning\n  * Process\n  * Puzzles\n  * Technique\n  * Words\n\n# Attractive Options for Unruly Letters:\n\n## Decimal\n\nThe unusual heritage of the Decimal typeface dictated a seriffed J, and a\nbranching K. An alternate lowercase J is included, with a sharp descender, one\nof the family\u2019s signature moves.\n\n## Cesium\n\nBecause the letters in the serpentine Cesium typeface are joined to their\ndiacritics, extra thought went into solving some of the rarer accents like the\nWelsh \u1e84.\n\n## Ringside Wide\n\nFor the letter Q, second rarest in the English language, we included three\nvariations in each style of our voluminous Ringside family, for a total of 516\nQs.\n\n## Requiem\n\nOne of Requiem\u2019s signature moments is its \u2018Greek Y\u2019 (akin to the letter\nupsilon), included as the default character in the Display and Fine styles,\nand as an alternate in Requiem Text.\n\n## Peristyle\n\nIn the Peristyle typeface, the upper- and lowercase K neatly synopsize two of\nthe family\u2019s typographic themes: the square-shouldered curve, and the darting\nwedge.\n\n## Sentinel\n\nWhile the letters v, w, x, y, and z are often a tedious end to an otherwise\ncolorful alphabet, in Sentinel Italic these diagonals are energized by\nstaccato pops and swelling curves.\n\n## Hoefler Titling\n\nAnother two diagonals saved from vapidity are the swash italic capital V and W\nin Hoefler Titling, whose sweeping gestures are balanced by taut, lachrymal\nterminals.\n\n## Isotope\n\nIn keeping with the mechanistic theme of the Isotope family are two variations\nof the letter Q: one with an acute diagonal tail, and one with a horizontal\nstroke that conforms to the baseline.\n\n## Acropolis\n\nThe angular motif of the Acropolis family produces tidily nipped corners in\nthe roman, but striking letterforms in the italics, where cursive shapes are\nrendered with electrifying geometry.\n\n## Mercury Text\n\nIn its italics, the flaring hairlines and punchy serifs of Mercury\u2019s romans\nare replaced by taut curves and swelling tails, that sparkle in even the\nfamily\u2019s heaviest weights.\n\n# Introducing Cesium\n\nAn inline adaptation of a distinctive slab serif, Cesium is an unusually\nresponsive display face that maintains its high energy across a range of\ndifferent moods.\n\n  * Decorative\n  * Headlines\n  * New Releases\n  * Slab Serif\n  * Vitesse\n\nI always felt that our Vitesse typeface, an unusual species of slab serif,\nwould take well to an inline. Vitesse is based not on the circle or the\nellipse, but on a less familiar shape that has no common name, a variation on\nthe \u2018stadium\u2019 that has two opposing flat edges, and two gently rounded sides.\nIn place of sharp corners, Vitesse uses a continuously flowing stroke to\nmanage the transition between upright and diagonal lines, most apparent on\nletters like M and N. A year of making this gesture with my wrist, both when\ndrawing letterforms and miming their intentions during design critiques, left\nme thinking about a reduced version of the typeface, in which letters would be\ndefined not by inside and outside contours, but by a single, fluid raceway.\nLike most straightforward ideas, this one proved challenging to execute, but\nits puzzles were immensely satisfying to solve.\n\nAdding an inline to a typeface is the quickest way to reveal its secrets. All\nthe furtive adjustments in weight and size that a type designer makes \u2014\nrelieving congestion by thinning the center arm of a bold E, or lightening the\nintersecting strokes of a W \u2014 are instantly exposed with the addition of a\ncenterline. Adapting an existing alphabet to accommodate this inline called\nfor renovating every single character (down to the capital I, the period, and\neven the space), in some cases making small adjustments to reallocate weight,\nat other times redesigning whole parts of the character set. The longer we\nworked on the typeface, the more we discovered opportunities to turn these\nconstraints into advantages, solving stubbornly complex characters like \u20ac and\n\u00a7 by redefining how an inline should behave, and using these new patterns to\nreshape the rest of the alphabet.\n\nThe slab serif Vitesse, and the inline Cesium.\n\nThe outcome is our new typeface, Cesium\u00ae. It shares many of Vitesse\u2019s\nqualities, its heartbeat an energetic thrum of motorsports and industry, and\nit will doubtless be welcome in both hardware stores and Hollywood. But we\u2019ve\nbeen surprised by Cesium\u2019s more reflective moods, its ability to be alert and\nsoftspoken at the same time. Much in the way that vibrant colors can animate a\ntypeface, we\u2019ve found that Cesium\u2019s sensitivity to spacing most effectively\nchanges its voice. Tighter leading and tracking turns up the heat, heightening\nCesium\u2019s sporty, high-tech associations, but with the addition of\nletterspacing it achieves an almost literary repose. This range of voices\nrecommends Cesium not only to logos, book covers, and title sequences, but to\nprojects that regularly must adjust their volume, such as identities,\npackaging, and editorial design. (Read more about how to use Cesium.)\n\nAs for its name: Cesium is a chemical element, one of only five metals that\u2019s\nliquid at room temperature. Resembling quicksilver, cesium is typically stored\nin a glass ampule, where the tension between a sturdy outer vessel and its\nvolatile contents is scintillating. The Cesium typeface hopes to capture this\nquality, its bright and insistent inline restrained by a strong and sinuous\ncontainer.\n\nCesium is one of only three H&Co typefaces whose name comes from the periodic\ntable, a distinction it shares with Mercury and Tungsten. At a time when I\nconsidered a more sci-fi name for the typeface, I learned that these three\nelements have an unusual connection: they\u2019re used together in the propulsion\nsystem of nasa\u2019s Deep Space 1, the first interplanetary spacecraft powered by\nan ion drive. I found the association compelling, and adopted the name at\nonce, with the hope that designers might employ the typeface in the same\nspirit of discovery, optimism, and invention. \u2014JH\n\nCesium by H&Co.
