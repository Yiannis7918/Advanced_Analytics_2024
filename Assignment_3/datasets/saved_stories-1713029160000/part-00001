This immersive and\nintense approach aims not just for language acquisition but for a memorable\nexperience within the literary world of your chosen language.\n\nToday, I'm excited to briefly share some insights from my latest milestone: 50\nbooks in 50 days.\n\nCOMPREHENSION and VOCABULARY EXPOSURE\n\nAs someone who started learning Polish just 5 and a half months ago with an A1\nability according to CEFR, my ability to follow along with native-speaking\nnarrators, even at 2x speed, has improved radically. My exposure to Polish\nvocabulary and the way words are combined continues to grow rapidly. I'm also\nnow familiar with many Polish words in their various grammatical forms.\n\nCHALLENGES and INSIGHTS\n\nBlitzing isn't always easy. Some books, like the Polish translations of H.G.\nWells' stories or Peter Thiel's \"Zero to One,\" required a very high\ncomprehension level. I spent a lot of time translating or making wild guesses\nabout certain passages. Business and technical books in Polish are definitely\nnot recommended for beginners like me.\n\nOther times, the book felt too long for a one-day reading, like with one\nparticular Polish version of \"Heart of Darkness.\" Luckily, tools like the\nNatural Reader app, which reads the text aloud and highlights as it goes,\nhelped me power through without losing my place.\n\nThe key to getting through any book, I've found, is knowing and using the\nlevers of flow. A flow state enhances cognitive performance and learning by\nreducing frontal brain activity, which minimizes mental interference and\ndistraction. I'm going to share my findings after a bit more experimentation\nand fine-tuning.\n\nTechnology is also an invaluable ally in Bimodal Blitzing. From LingQ and\nReadlang for quick translations to Natural Reader's excellent TTS feature that\nkept me on track even during a treadmill session, these tools have made it\npossible to persevere through challenging texts and long reading sessions.\n\nREFLECTIONS and LOOKING FOWARD\n\nFifty days and fifty books later, my understanding of Polish has deepened\nsignificantly. While I've encountered challenges, such as committing words to\nlong-term memory and comprehending complex texts, the journey has been\nrewarding. Bimodal Blitzing has not only improved my language skills but also\nallowed me to explore a wide range of literature that I wouldn't have\notherwise experienced.\n\nAs I look forward to the next fifty days, I'm stoke about the stories that\nawait and the progress I'll continue to make. The Bimodal Blitzathon is more\nthan just a language learning challenge; it's a feast of language and ideas,\none book at a time.\n\nStay tuned for more updates and insights on Goodreads and on my Twitter/x\nfeed. And for those intrigued by the Bimodal Blitz method, I encourage you to\ndive into a book in your target language and experience the immersive world of\nbimodal reading and listening.\n\nP.S. A book on how to Bimodal Blitz will eventually be released explaining the\nmethod in detail. For updates, please subscribe to this blog.\n\nYou just read issue #1 of Bimodal Blitz.
