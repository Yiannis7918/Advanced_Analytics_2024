The non-\ngovernmental organisation recently found that about 70% of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s sales in\nthe UK were of foods high in fat, salt and sugar.\n\nSimon Rawson, the deputy chief executive of ShareAction, said: \u201cWhile the vote\nwe achieved today may be less than we wanted, the direction of travel is\nclear. Investors and consumers are recognising the importance of addressing\nthe business risks and public health impacts of an industry that is heavily\nreliant on the sales of unhealthy food. They have growing expectations not\nonly from Nestl\u00e9 but from all food manufacturers.\u201d\n\nNestl\u00e9, which is listed in Zurich and owns brands including KitKat and Yorkie\nchocolate bars and Quality Street sweets, said its own figures showed that 60%\nof sales, excluding pet food, came from \u201cmore nutritious or specialised\nnutrition products\u201d, and only 21% of its portfolio was focused on indulgent\nfoods.\n\nIn video message to shareholders, its chair, Paul Bulcke, said Nestl\u00e9 had\nalways been committed to helping consumers make informed choices as part of a\nbalanced diet. \u201cOf course, this also includes enjoying moments of indulgence,\ngood chocolate for example, from time to time and in a responsible way,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\n\u201cA small group of shareholders led by the NGO ShareAction wants us to\ndisengage from indulgent products. This is wrong. It will restrict Nestl\u00e9\u2019s\nstrategic freedom and limit management\u2019s ability to make decisions or\nresponsible decisions. The shareholders\u2019 proposal is not in our best interest,\nnot for our consumers, and not for you.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Business Today\n\nFree daily newsletter\n\nGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and\nanalysis you need every morning\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

ShareAction said it fell far short of investor expectations.\n\nShareAction said the nutritious sales target was simply in line with Nestl\u00e9\u2019s\noverall growth forecasts and made no commitment on the sale of unhealthy\nproducts, which could increase at a similar rate. As a result, it would not\nshift Nestl\u00e9\u2019s reliance on sales of unhealthy products. The target also\nincludes products such as coffee that have no nutritional value, it added.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Nestl\u00e9\n  * Food & drink industry\n  * Health\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### Brexit import charges may mean rise in food prices, say trade groups\n\n4 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### UK food price inflation slows to 4.5% but many shoppers still struggling\n\n26 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### \u2018Beer louts with unhealthy diets\u2019: why British cooking still hasn\u2019t won over the French\n\n23 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### Love at first bite: how Britain fell for a little Portuguese custard tart\n\n2 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### Raw deal?
