Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n# DongleHider+ is a cunning new Framework laptop Expansion Card for hiding up\nto three dongles\n\nNews\n\nBy Mark Tyson\n\npublished March 21, 2024\n\nProject also provides a useful exterior USB port.\n\n(Image credit: LeoDJ)\n\nDeveloper and maker LeoDJ has shared his design for a Framework laptop\nexpansion card that will surely gain wide appreciation among owners of the\nmodular PC. The DongleHider+ can fit up to three dongles inside and offers an\noutward-facing USB Type-A connector.\n\nUsing this card does take a bit of DIY muscle, as it's not for sale. To hide\nyour Logitech Unifying dongle-sized device successfully, its outer casing\nneeds to be removed.\n\nFits flush, and provides a useful USB Type-A port. (Image credit: LeoDJ)\n\nLeoDJ didn't like the Bluetooth latency of his wireless mouse, so they wanted\nto keep the Logitech Unifying dongle permanently plugged into his laptop\nwithout spoiling the device's clean lines. The DongleHider+ project admirably\nachieves these goals, and more, by providing connectivity for up to three\n(tiny) dongles and offering a handy USB Type-A port.\n\nThere are more than enough instructions for those wishing to follow in LeoDJ's\nfootsteps. From the Framework community post, you can head over to the maker's\nGitHub repo and Mastodon threads, which are packed with useful source files\nfor getting the PCB and Framework laptop expansion card made. The Mastodon\nthread is particularly useful as it offers a pictorial assembly guide.\n\nFrom left to right: A standard USB A expansion card, A bare DongleHider+ PCB,\nTwo assembled DongleHider+ PCBs, A stock Logitech Unifying dongle, A fully\nassembled DongleHider+ expansion card, with installed dongle and 3D-printed\nshell. (Image credit: LeoDJ)\n\nSome people might be nervous about breaking apart and soldering in the dongles\nthey want to install permanently in the DongleHider+, but LeoDJ says they are\npretty cheap on used goods marketplaces. Clear instructions for disassembling\nLogitech's Unifying Gen1 and Gen2 dongles are provided. Furthermore, the\nsoldering of the dongle to the PCB shouldn't be too challenging \u2013 especially\nif you only decide to install a single dongle internally.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware\n\nReady to solder a dongle in place. (Image credit: LeoDJ)\n\nLeoDJ has provided a few compatibility notes: Using the Framework 13 (AMD\nversions) and 16 (AMD versions) he noticed that when connected to a USB4\ncapable expansion card slot, a USB 3 device is connected to the exterior port\nthe second internal USB dongle stops working.\n\nWe've reviewed various Framework laptop sizes and generations, most recently\nthe powerful Framework 16 with AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS and Radeon RX 7700S (8GB\nGDDR6, 100W TGP) graphics module option installed.\n\n## Stay on the Cutting Edge\n\nJoin the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC\ntech news \u2014 and have for over 25 years.
