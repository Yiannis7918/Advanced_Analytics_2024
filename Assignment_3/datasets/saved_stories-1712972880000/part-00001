What he found was\nabsolutely remarkable: all of the galaxies in the universe appeared to be\nmoving away from our planet. Furthermore, the farther a galaxy was, the faster\nit was receding. Generations of astronomers have improved upon Hubble\u2019s\noriginal methods and with time developed the new ones.\n\n### According to new analysis by Prof. Wendy Freedman, there may not be a\nconflict in the expanding universe debate\n\nImage credits: ESA / Hubble\n\nImage credits: ESA / Hubble\n\nImage credits: ESA / Hubble\n\nAt the moment there are 2 main methods of measuring the universe\u2019s rate of\nexpansion, in other words called the \u201cHubble constant.\u201d The 1st one is\ncalculated from nearby observations of supernovae, and the 2nd uses the\n\u201ccosmic microwave background,\u201d or radiation that began to stream freely\nthrough the Universe shortly after the Big Bang. These 2 methods were always\nin disagreement with one another because they differ by about 10%. This has\ncaused widespread debate among physicists and astronomers until today. The new\nstudy made by Wendy Freedman and her team may bring some light in here.\n\nMore info: APS\n\nWendy Freedman and her colleagues have used the James Webb Space Telescope\n(JWST) to add two more methods to the local distance ladder. The team were\nobserving 2 other type of stars \u2013 carbon stars and red giant branch ones. Each\nof them had predictable luminosities based on their mass.\n\nWendy Freedman presented her study on the 6th of April at a meeting of the\nAmerican Physical Society: \u201cThese much more precise data are not screaming out\nsaying you really need new physics. We are finally converging now \u2013 it\u2019s\nreally exciting,\u201d the scientist couldn\u2019t hold back her joy.\n\nFreedman and her team focused on the middle part of the cosmic distance ladder\nby observing nearby galaxies. Crucially, the galaxies they have chosen also\nhad supernovas in them; therefore, they could used them to calibrate the\ndistances to all of those more distant galaxies that have supernova absorbed\nin them. They did this for 3 different types of stars separately so they could\nlater compare the 3 different methods of calculating the distances.\n\nThis method is called blind analysis because in the beginning, you don\u2019t see\nany real numbers, nor any real values until the very end. Only when it\u2019s clear\nthat it\u2019s working can the scientists input the real data, a process called\nunblinding \u2013 when you finally get to see the real results.\n\n### Our universe is expanding, yet 2 different main ways to measure it until\nnow have resulted in different answers\n\nPowered By\n\n10\n\nSeverely Sick Man Posts His Last Wish To See Unreleased Avengers Movie, Disney\nContacts Him\n\nShare\n\nNext\n\nStay\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nImage credits: APS\n\nImage credits: ESO\n\nImage credits: ESA / Hubble\n\nImage credits: NOIRLab\n\nIt\u2019s important to mention that the scientific team not only carried out a\nblind analysis, but also completely reanalyzed all of the old Hubble Space\nTelescope data as well. After doing all of it, they have found that all the 3\ndifferent types of stars they used agreed on the distances to those\nneighboring galaxies, which meant that the data is consistent. And then they\ncould recalibrate the distances to those in more distant galaxies with the\nsupernova and then recalculate the current expansion rate of the universe. The\nscientists got a Hubble constant of about 69 km/sec/Mpc, which is consistent\nwith the CMB measurements. \u201cThe difference between a Hubble constant of 73 and\n69 is small, but these things are really important to get right,\u201d said\nFreedman.\n\nSome other scientists are skeptical about this new discovery. Daniel Scolnic,\nfrom Duke University in North Carolina, states that the number of galaxies\nobserved with JWST is relatively small and that the other groups have come up\nwith a higher figure for the Hubble constant based on JWST data, rather than\nthe lower one Freedman\u2019s team found.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAdam Riess, from Johns Hopkins University in Maryland, also looks at the new\nstudy carefully: \u201cI do not believe the Hubble tension has changed, but I do\nknow there is a difference in the way we are analyzing supernovae... one that\nproduces a difference in the Hubble constant. I don\u2019t think it would be fair\nor accurate to define the size of the tension from the lowest (or highest)\nmeasure.\u201d\n\nFreedman and her colleagues still have a long way to go by finishing\ncalculating the uncertainties of their measurement. Despite that, it leans\ntowards matching the CMB Hubble constant, and isn\u2019t inconsistent with previous\nlocal measurements. \u201cIs this the end of the tension? Nothing dies that simply.\nBut these data are pointing the way,\u201d concluded Freedman.\n\n### For the past decade, astrophysics have divided into 2 groups: the one that\nbelieves that the difference is significant and the 2nd one that thinks it\ncould be due to errors in measurements\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nImage credits: NASA\n\nImage credits: ESA / Hubble\n\nImage credits: NASA\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Hubble constant has seemed to be an unsolvable puzzle for many years.\nTherefore, according to Daniel Scolnic, if the Hubble tension finally\ndisappeared, it would mean passing the \u2018end-to-end\u2019 test of cosmology. Even\nthough Wendy Freedman and her colleagues still have to do more calculations to\nbetter prove their statement, to be so close to nailing down the most\ncontroversial numbers in cosmology for years is already a very huge\naccomplishment.\n\n### People shared their excitement about the new discovery of Hubble tension\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnyone can write on Bored Panda.
