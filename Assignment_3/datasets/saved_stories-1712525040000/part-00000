Audience of the Moon\n\nOctober 3, 2017\n\n# Audience of the Moon\n\nEdward Oakes Data Scientist\n\nJeffery Kline Principal Data Scientist\n\nOn Monday, August 21, 2017, the United States experienced an awesome event:\nthe first solar eclipse visible across the contiguous U.S. since 1918.\nMillions of Americans paused their daily routines to step outside and admire\nour moon as it passed in front of the sun. As the lunar shadow traced its path\nacross the country, a digital shadow of online activity traced along with it.\nThe audience of the eclipse, enchanted by events in the sky, was offline.\n\nAlthough everyone within the 48 contiguous states had at least a view of a\npartial eclipse, the path of totality was a narrow strip just 70 miles wide.\nThis path began in Oregon and passed from the Pacific Northwest to South\nCarolina, including through major cities such as Kansas City and St. Louis.\nAny fixed spot within this region experienced darkness of night for a brief 3\nminutes.\n\nKnowing with high precision when and where totality was occurring, it is\npossible to reconstruct the moon\u2019s path across the U.S. over time. Mapping\nthis path against comScore\u2019s geolocated data, we can visualize the\ncharacteristics of internet traffic during the eclipse. In the following\nseries of heatmaps, we display several snapshots of internet traffic at zip-\ncode granularity across the United States (red=high, blue=low) alongside the\ncenter of the path of the eclipse as it moves across the country.\n\nThese plots tell a clear story: internet traffic decreases along the path of\nthe center of the eclipse, and this feature is most dramatic during totality.\n\nSource: comScore Data Science; August 21, 2017\n\nIt is well-known that desktop browsing behavior and mobile browsing behavior\nhave very different characteristics. To explore this, we drill down into a\nsingle city over which the total eclipse travelled and categorize traffic as\noriginating from either a desktop or mobile user. In the following plot, we\ndisplay the traffic in Kansas City over the UTC day on which the eclipse\noccurred, split into the two streams.\n\nSource: comScore Data Science\n\nThere is a striking deviation here between the two traffic streams: during the\neclipse, desktop traffic decreased significantly more than mobile traffic did.\nIntuitively, this makes sense - people going outside to view the spectacle\nleft their desktop machines idle but may still have been browsing on their\nmobile devices.\n\nStudying this event from the perspective of comScore\u2019s data sources has\nprovided more than an interesting study on internet audience behavior. It has\nalso allowed us a unique opportunity to run a series of sanity checks on our\nmeasurements and metadata.\n\nIn summary, eclipses have scientific value beyond the realm of astronomy. As\ndemonstrated here, we used this extraordinary and rare spectacle as an\nopportunity to further our understanding of digital audience behavior and to\ntest our data\u2019s ability to expose such trends.\n\n#### More about\n\nEvents Marketing Research\n\n### Stay connected\n\nJoin Our Email List Get Our Mobile App\n\n## Related Insights\n\nBlog\n\n##### comScore Appoints Joseph R.
