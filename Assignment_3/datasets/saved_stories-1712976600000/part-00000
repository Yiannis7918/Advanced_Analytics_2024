The study, \u201cNYSolarCast: A Solar Power Forecasting System for New\nYork State,\u201d shows the tool\u2019s proficiency in forecasting global horizontal\nirradiance (GHI) using data from various locations in the state, often\noutshining its commercial counterparts.\n\nThe New York Independent System Operator (ISO) region, exclusive to the Empire\nState, employs five-minute wholesale electricity settling periods, segmenting\nelectricity sales into five-minute intervals for efficient grid distribution.\nWith natural fluctuation from wind and solar energy, plus the addition of\nsubstantial and rapidly responsive energy storage systems, the utility of\nfrequently updated electricity generation projections cannot be overstated.\nThis step mirrors global advancements in energy management, similar to the\nsignificant industry shift witnessed when Australia commenced its transition\nto five-minute settlements.\n\nNYSolarCast, developed by researchers from the National Center for Atmospheric\nResearch (NCAR) in 2021, was tailored to help New York state manage its\nexpanding solar power infrastructure. The tool\u2019s forecasts of GHI, which is an\nindicator of potential electricity production from solar plants, are updated\nevery 15 minutes at select solar farms and on an hourly basis for each zip\ncode.\n\nThe tool\u2019s predictive accuracy is honed by training on a plethora of data\nstreams. This includes three years of real-world data from 10 utility-scale\nsolar power plants and 490 distributed solar sites, paired with the\ncorresponding weather conditions when available. These data points are further\nenriched by weather information from New York state\u2019s expansive network of 126\nNYS Mesonet stations.\n\nNYSolarCast aligns its forecasts with the data from Mesonet weather stations,\nshown below:\n\nThe NYS Mesonet is a comprehensive network of 126 surface weather stations\nthat deliver \u201creal-time averaged observations at a temporal resolution of five\nminutes.\u201d These stations, spaced approximately 19 miles apart, ensure at least\none station per county across all 62 counties and the five boroughs of New\nYork City. They monitor and transmit data on a variety of atmospheric\nparameters, including temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, GHI, wind\nvelocity and direction, and precipitation.\n\n### Popular content\n\nThe research team notes that while NYSolarCast is open source and therefore\nfreely accessible and usable by all, it may serve best as a framework rather\nthan direct code application. This is attributed to the distinct weather input\nfeatures of New York state, which vary greatly from region to region, each\nnecessitating tailored tools and resources.\n\nThe source code of the tool is available for download on GitHub.\n\nWhen analyzing the data, the authors conducted tests to determine the\nimportance of various predictors (factors that influence the accuracy of their\nsolar generation forecasts). They discovered that certain key pieces of data,\nsuch as weather conditions or solar irradiance levels, were only relevant for\na short period, around 45 minutes before conditions changed.\n\nThe authors observed that prediction errors varied throughout the day, with a\nnoticeable increase in the late afternoon to evening hours. They attributed\nthis rise in inaccuracies to the data becoming less current as the day\nprogresses. While this time frame doesn\u2019t align with the peak solar generation\nperiod of 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., the evening hours are often marked by higher\nelectricity costs on the grid, making accurate predictions especially\nvaluable.\n\nThroughout a one-year validation period, wherein forecasts \u201cwere produced and\ndelivered on a quasi-operational schedule,\u201d the findings presented a complex\nand nuanced picture. Despite revealing various potential areas for\nimprovement, the core results of the study remained clear. NYSolarCast GHI\nforecasts overall out-performed both smart persistence and the NWP blended\nforecast of hourly-issued WRF-Solar and HRRR models at all intra-day (out to\nsix hours) lead and valid times.\n\nFurthermore, the forecasts made by NYSolarCast were \u201cnearly always better\u201d\nthan those derived from tools situated precisely at the weather stations. This\nis likely because the tool could analyze real-time data straight from active\nsolar farms, unlike weather stations, which had limited access to real-time\ndata.\n\nOne potential area for improvement identified by the researchers is the\nintegration of real-time data from the utility-scale solar facility\npyranometers, which measure the intensity of solar radiation. Although this\ndata contributed to the validation process, its inclusion in the predictive\nphase was hindered by the delay in data accessibility.\n\nThis content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.
