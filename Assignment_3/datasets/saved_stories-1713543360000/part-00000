The buttered cat paradox, submitted by artist\nJohn Frazee of Kingston, New York, won a 1993 Omni magazine competition about\nparadoxes.^[1]^[2] The basic premise, stating the conditions of the cat and\nbread and posed as a question, was presented in a routine by comic and juggler\nMichael Davis, appearing on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, July 22,\n1988.^[3]\n\n## Thought experiments[edit]\n\nThe buttered cat paradox has been highlighted as a paradigmatic example of a\nthought experiment.^[4] Some people jokingly maintain that the experiment\nproduces an anti-gravity effect. They propose that as the cat falls toward the\nground, it slows down and starts to rotate, eventually reaching a steady state\nof hovering a short distance from the ground while rotating at high speed as\nboth the buttered side of the toast and the cat's feet attempt to land on the\nground.^[5] In June 2003, Kimberly Miner won a Student Academy Award for her\nfilm Perpetual Motion.^[6]^[7] Miner based her film on a paper written by a\nhigh-school friend that explored the potential implications of the cat and\nbuttered toast idea.^[8]^[9]\n\n## In humor[edit]\n\nThe faux paradox has captured the imagination of science-oriented humorists.\nIn May 1992, the Usenet Oracle Digest #441 included a question from a\nsupplicant asking about the paradox.^[10] Testing the theory is the main theme\nin an episode of the comic book strip Jack B. Quick. The title character seeks\nto test this theory, leading to the cat hovering above the ground and the\ncat's wagging tail providing propulsion. The March 31, 2005, strip of the\nwebcomic Bunny also explored the idea in the guise of a plan for a \"Perpetual\nMotion MoggieToast 5k Power Generator\", based on Sod's law.^[11] In Science\nAskew, Donald E. Simanek comments on this phenomenon.^[12]\n\nBrazilian energy drink brand Flying Horse released a 2012 award-winning\ncommercial^[13] that simulates the recreation of this phenomenon, which is\nthen used to create perpetual energy.^[14]\n\n## In reality[edit]\n\nCats possess the ability to turn themselves right side up in mid-air if they\nshould fall upside-down, known as the cat righting reflex. This enables them\nto land on their feet if dropped from sufficient height.^[15]^[16]\n\nA study at Manchester Metropolitan University involving dropping 100 slices of\nbuttered toast under laboratory conditions established that it typically lands\non the floor butter-side-down as a result of the manner in which it is\ntypically dropped from a table, and the aerodynamic drag caused by the air\npockets within the bread. The toast is typically butter-side-up when dropped.\nAs it falls, it rotates; given the typical speed of rotation and the typical\nheight of a table, a slice of toast that began butter-side-up on the table\nlands butter-side-down on the floor in 81% of cases.^[17]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Philosophy portal\n\n  * High-rise syndrome\n  * List of paradoxes\n  * Schr\u00f6dinger's cat\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Morris, Scot (July 1993). \"I Have a Theory...\" (PDF).
