All photos by Lionel\nDelevingne.\n\nby Murray Bookchin\n\nOn August 24, 1978, Murray Bookchin gave a lecture at the Toward Tomorrow Fair\nin Amherst, Massachusetts. Also speaking at that year\u2019s gathering were several\nprominent thinkers, including R. Buckminster Fuller and Ralph Nader. In his\nspeech, Bookchin argues against the ideology of futurism and for ecological\nutopianism. In the Q&A session, he points out that he is not against\ntechnology itself, he is against technocracy, and he also describes, in\ndetail, his political vision for the future.\n\nThe speech is surprisingly relevant in today\u2019s context: it\u2019s as if he\npredicted the rise of fascist ideology and lifeboat ethics in the 21st\ncentury, and it feels like a direct rebuttal of Elon Musk-esque technocratic\nfuturism on both the right and the left.\n\nBecause his speech is so applicable today, we decided to republish it here,\nmaking it accessible to a wider audience. It has been transcribed and edited\nlightly for flow, brevity, and grammar, and we have divided it into sub-\nsections for ease of reading. The text is published with the permission of The\nBookchin Trust.\n\nThis morning at eleven o\u2019clock, I tried to explain to you why I was not an\nenvironmentalist, but rather was an ecologist. And I tried to give you some\nidea, at least from my point of view, what ecology meant, as distinguished\nfrom environmentalism. The point that I tried to make most fundamentally is\nthat environmentalism tries to patch things up, applies band-aids, cosmetics,\nto the environment. It sort of takes hold of nature, strokes it, and says,\n\u2018Produce!\u2019 It tries to use soil, pour chemicals into it and if only they\nweren\u2019t poisonous everything would be great. Whereas ecology believes in a\ngenuine harmonization of humanity with nature. And that harmonization of\nhumanity with nature depends fundamentally on the harmonization of human\nbeings with each other. The attitude that we\u2019ve had towards nature has always\ndepended on the attitude we\u2019ve had towards each other. Let\u2019s not kid\nourselves, there is no such thing as a \u2018pure nature.\u2019\n\nThe simple fact now is that I\u2019m not only not an environmentalist, I\u2019ve got\nsome hot news\u2014I\u2019m not a futurist. I\u2019m not a futurist at all. I\u2019m a utopian. I\nwant to see this word revived. I want to see us use it. I want to see us think\nutopian. Not think futurism. And it\u2019s these questions that I\u2019d like to talk\nabout, if I may.\n\nMurray Bookchin at the Toward Tomorrow Fair, 1977.\n\nWhat is futurism?\n\nWhat is futurism? Futurism is the present as it exists today, projected, one\nhundred years from now. That\u2019s what futurism is. If you have a population of X\nbillions of people, how are you going to have food, how are you going to do\nthis... nothing has changed. All they do is they make everything either\nbigger, or they change the size\u2014you\u2019ll live in thirty story buildings, you\u2019ll\nlive in sixty-story buildings. Frank Lloyd Wright was going to build an office\nbuilding that was one mile high. That was futurism.\n\nThe simple fact is, I just don\u2019t believe that we have to extend the present\ninto the future. We have to change the present so that the future looks very,\nvery different from what it is today. This is a terribly important notion to\nconvey. So a lot of people are walking around today who sound very idealistic.\nAnd what do they want to do? They want multinational corporations to become\nmulti-cosmic corporations [laughter from the audience]\u2014literally!\n\nThey want to bring them up in space, they want to colonize the Moon, they\ncan\u2019t wait to go to Jupiter, much less Mars. They\u2019re all very busy, they\u2019re\ncoming around, they even have long hair and they even have beards, and they\ncome around and they say \u2018Oh, I can\u2019t wait to get into my first space\nshuttle!\u2019\u2014that is the future.\n\nThis is regarded as ecology and it\u2019s not ecology. It\u2019s futurism! It\u2019s what\nExxon wants to do. It\u2019s what Chase Manhattan wants to do. It\u2019s what all the\ncorporations want to do. But it is not utopia, it is pure futurism. It is the\npresent extended into the future.\n\nA mass society, and how do we keep in touch with each other? We don\u2019t even\nhave to look at each other. We\u2019ll look at television screens. I\u2019ll press a\nbutton, I\u2019ll see you on the television screen, you\u2019ll be on Mars, for all I\nknow, and we\u2019ll have a wonderful conversation with each other, and we\u2019ll say\n\u2018Gee whiz! We\u2019ve got an alternate technology!\u2019 The point is it isn\u2019t a\nliberatory technology. I may know people in the future for years and\nyears\u2014play chess games with them, have interesting intellectual conversations\nwith them\u2014and never touch them once. If that is what the future is going to\nlook like, I\u2019m glad I\u2019m fifty-seven years old and don\u2019t have that much to go.\nI don\u2019t want it. [laughter from audience] I am very serious.\n\nThe anti-nuclear movement.\n\nNow I\u2019d like to touch a few nerves. I don\u2019t believe that the Earth is a\nspaceship.^6 I\u2019m asking you to think about what it means to think of the Earth\nas a spaceship. It does not have valves. It does not have all kinds of radar\nequipment to guide it. It is not moved by rockets. It hasn\u2019t got any plumbing.\nWe may have plumbing. But it is not \u2018a spaceship\u2019. It\u2019s an organic, living\nthing, to a very great extent, at least on its surface, built of inorganic\nmaterial. It is in the process of growth and it is in the process of\ndevelopment. It is not \u2018a spaceship\u2019.\n\nWe\u2019re beginning to develop a language which has nothing whatever in common\nwith ecology. It has a lot to do with electronics. We talk of input. \u2018Give me\nyour input. Plug in!\u2019 [laughter] Well, I don\u2019t \u2018plug in\u2019, I discuss\n[applause]. Machines \u2018plug in\u2019. Radar is the language that produced it and the\nmilitary is the language that produced the words \u2018plug in\u2019.\n\n\u2018Give me your input\u2019. That is not what I want. I don\u2019t want your output, I\nwant you. I want to hear your words. I want to hear your language. I\u2019m not\nengaged in \u2018feedback\u2019 with you [laughter], I\u2019m engaged in a dialogue, a\ndiscussion. It isn\u2019t your \u2018feedback\u2019 I want, I want your opinion. I want to\nknow what you think. I don\u2019t want to have a circuit plugged into me where I\ncan get your \u2018feedback\u2019 and you can get my \u2018input\u2019. [laughter]\n\nPlease, I\u2019m making a plea here, and if you think I\u2019m talking about language, I\nthink you would be wrong. I\u2019m not talking about language, I\u2019m talking about\nsensibility. A plant does not have \u2018input\u2019 or \u2018output\u2019. It does something for\nwhich electronics has absolutely no language\u2014it grows! It grows! [applause].\nAnd let me tell you another thing, it not only grows, it does more than\nchange; it develops. We have a big problem with all these words which reflect\na way in which we think, and that\u2019s what bothers me.\n\nThis is the sensibility of futurism. It is the language of futurism, in which\npeople themselves are molecularized and then atomized and then finally reduced\nto subatomic particles, and what we really have in the way of an ecosystem is\nnot growth, and not development, what we have is\u2014plumbing. We run kilocalories\nthrough the ecosystem. And we turn on valves here and we turn off valves\nthere.\n\nNow, this may be useful, I don\u2019t deny that. We should know how energy moves\nthrough an ecosystem. But that alone is not an ecosystem. We\u2019re beginning to\nlearn that plants have a life of their own and interact with each other. That\nthere are subtle mechanisms which we cannot really understand. They can\u2019t be\nreduced to energy, they can\u2019t be reduced to kilocalories, we have to look at\nthem from a different point of view. We have to view them as life, as\ndistinguished from the non-living, and even that distinction is not so sharp\nand clear as many people think.\n\nMost futurists start out with the idea, \u2018you got a shopping mall, what do you\ndo then?\u2019 Well, the first question to be asked is, \u2018why the hell do you have a\nshopping mall?\u2019\n\nSo this is the language of futurism, and the language of electronics, which\nreflects a very distinct sensibility, that bothers me very, very, much. It is\nnot utopian\u2014and I\u2019ll get to that afterwards\u2014it is the language of\nmanipulation. It is the language of mass society. Most futurists start out\nwith the idea, \u2018you got a shopping mall, what do you do then?\u2019 Well, the first\nquestion to be asked is, \u2018why the hell do you have a shopping mall?\u2019\n[laughter] That is the real question that has to be asked. Not \u2018what if\u2019 you\nhave a shopping mall, then what do you do.\n\nOut there in the great vast distance, which people feel we should colonize,\nmoving out into spacecraft, or somehow relate to the distant universe and\nlisten to the stars, but we haven\u2019t even begun to listen to our own feelings.\nWe haven\u2019t even begun to listen to our own locality. This planet is going down\nin ruin, and people are talking about means of projecting space platforms out\nthere, talking of a global village,^7 when we don\u2019t have villages anywhere on\nthis planet to begin with. We don\u2019t have them. We don\u2019t have any villages, we\ndon\u2019t have any communities, we live in a state of atomization, and we expect\nto electronically communicate with each other through global villages. This\nbothers me because it may be good physics, it may be good mechanics, it may be\ngood dynamics, it may be good anything you wish, but it is not ecology. It is\nnot ecology.\n\nWhat is ecology?\n\nThe most fundamental mistake begins with the idea that things change. Now, you\nknow, to change may mean something or may mean nothing. If I step away here\nand walk three feet away, I have \u2018undergone change\u2019. I\u2019ve moved three feet\naway, but I haven\u2019t done a damn thing so far as I\u2019m concerned, or so far as\nyou are concerned. It is not \u2018change\u2019 that I\u2019m concerned about. What I\u2019m\nconcerned about is development, growth. I don\u2019t mean growth in the business\nsense, I mean growth of human potentiality, I mean growth of human spirit. I\nmean growth of human contact. That is ecological. To develop is what is really\necological. To change can mean anything. The question is, what is the end\ntoward which you want to develop? What is the goal you\u2019re trying to realize,\nand then, afterward, whether or not you have developed to that goal. So mere\ninput and output and feedback, mere motion means nothing\u2014the real problem is\ndiscussion and dialogue, recognition of personality, growth and development,\nwhich is what biology is concerned with. It is not concerned merely with\nchange.\n\nLastly, it must be made very clear that if you believe that the Earth is a\nspaceship, then you believe that the world is a watch. You and Sir Isaac\nNewton agree perfectly, the world is a clock, just as a spaceship is a lot of\nplumbing with a lot of rockets, with a lot of dials, with a lot of pilots, and\nall the rest of that stuff. And if you believe in addition that the beauty,\ntoday, of change is that you can move all over the place in a helicopter,\nwhich will pick up your geodesic dome,^8 or use some type of electronic\ncommunications to relate to somebody who is three thousand miles away, whom\nyou may never see, then we are not changing, in the developmental sense,\nanything at all, we\u2019re making things worse, and worse all the time. And that\nis a matter, also, of very great concern to me.\n\nEcology\u2014social ecology\u2014must begin with a love of place. There must be home.\nOikos\u2014home\u2014ecology\u2014the study of the household. If we do not have a\nhousehold\u2014and that household is not an organic, rich community\u2014if we do not\nknow the land we live on, if we do not understand its soil, if we do not\nunderstand the people we live with, if we cannot relate to them, then at that\nparticular point we are really in a spaceship. We are really out in a void.\n\nEcology must begin with a very deep understanding of the interaction between\npeople, and the interaction between people and the immediate ecosystem in\nwhich we live. Where you come from, what you love, what is the land that you\nlove. I don\u2019t mean the country or the state, I\u2019m talking about the land that\nyou may occupy. It may even be a village, it may be a city, it may be a\nfarmstead.\n\nBut first and foremost, without those roots that place you in nature, and in a\nspecific form of nature, it is a deception to talk about cosmic oneness, it is\na deception to talk about spaceships, it is a deception even to talk about\necosystems without having this sense of unity with your immediate locale, with\nyour soil, with your community, with your home. Without that community and\nwithout that sense of home, without that sense of the organic\u2014of the organic\nand the developmental rather than the mere inorganic and \u2018change\u2019 in which you\nmerely change place\u2014you are changing nothing, the problems are merely\namplified or diminished, but they remain the same problems.\n\nWhat isn\u2019t ecology?\n\nIt is for this reason that futurism today plays an increasingly very very\nreactionary role, because it works with the prejudice that what you have is\ngiven. You have to assume what exists today, and you extrapolate into the\nfuture, and you play a numbers game. And then you go around and you\nlogistically manipulate here and there, and implicit in all of this is the\nidea that you are things to be manipulated. There are all kinds of technicians\nwho are going to decide through their knowledge of electronics, through their\n\u2018know-how\u2019, through their \u2018feedback\u2019 and their \u2018input\u2019, where you go, what you\nshould do: and this is becoming a very serious problem today, particularly\nwhen it is mistaken for ecology, based on the organic, on the growing, on the\ndevelopment as an individual, as a community and as a place.\n\nYou then finally reach the most sinister numbers game of all: who should live\nand who should die. The \u2018population game\u2019. The terrifying lifeboat ethic, in\nwhich now in the name of ecology, today views are being proposed that are\nalmost indistinguishable from German fascism.\n\nThere are those who are made to drown, they happen to live in India.\nConveniently, they happen to have black or dark skin, and you can identify\nthem. And then there are those who occupy another lifeboat, that lifeboat is\ncalled North America. And in that lifeboat, you have to conserve what you\nhave, you see?\n\nYou have to be prepared to develop an ethic, you have to be prepared to\ndevelop the stamina to see people die. Of course you\u2019ll regret it, but scarce\nresources and growing population, what can you do? You\u2019re out there on the\nocean, the ship is sinking, so instead of trying to find out what was wrong\nwith the ship that makes it sink, and instead of trying to build a ship that\nwill make it possible for all of us to share the world, you get into a\nlifeboat, just like you get into a spaceship, and at that particular point,\nthe world be damned. And that is a very sinister ideology.\n\nI speak as one who comes from the thirties, and remembers, very dramatically,\nthat there was the demographic ecology, if you like, in Germany, no different\nfrom some of the demographic ecology I have been witnessing today.^9 Remember\nwell that the implications of some of these conceptions are extremely\ntotalitarian, extremely un-ecological, extremely inorganic, and tend, if\nanything, to promote a totalitarian vision of the future in which there is no\nhuman scale, in which there is no human control.\n\nAnother thing that troubles me very deeply is the enormous extent to which\nsocial ecology or ecological problems are reduced simply to technological\nproblems. That is ridiculous. It\u2019s absurd. The factory is a place where people\nare controlled, whether they build solar collectors or not. It makes no\ndifference. [Applause] The same relationships will exist there as under any\nother circumstances of domination exist. If \u2018household\u2019 means that women take\ncare of the dishes, and men go out and do the manly work such as make war and\nclean up the planet, and reduce the population, where have we gone? Nothing\nhas changed. What will a \u2018spaceship\u2019 on earth look like? What will it be? Who\nwill be the general to give the orders, who will be the navigator to decide\nwhich way the \u2018spaceship\u2019 goes?\n\nPlease bear in mind what the implications of these things are. If people live\nin cities that are one mile high, how the hell can you get to know each other?\nHow can you have a feeling for the land in which you live, when the landscape\nthat you see goes up to a horizon twenty, thirty, forty miles away? On top of\nthe World Trade Center, I have no feeling for New York. If I were just an\nordinary, simple product of the United States Airforce, and I were ordered\nfrom the World Trade Center, way up there, to bomb Manhattan, looking down\nupon it, I would see nothing. I would press the button and it would be\nmeaningless. Up would go the great bomb, the great flash, the great cloud. It\nwouldn\u2019t have any meaning to me. Down on the ground, when I look up at the\nEmpire State Building or the World Trade Center, I feel oppressed. I feel that\nI have been reduced to a lowly ant. I begin to feel the demand for an\nenvironment that I can control. That I can begin to understand. But when I see\nplants growing around me, when I see life existing around me\u2014human life,\nanimal life of all its different forms, flora\u2014then I can relate. This is my\nland.\n\nThink human\n\nWhat we have to do is not only \u2018think small\u2019, we have to think human.^10 Small\nis not enough. What is human is what counts, not just what is small. What is\nbeautiful are people, what is beautiful is the ecosystems and their integrity\nin which we live. What is beautiful is the soil which we share with the rest\nof the world of life. And particularly that special bit of soil in which we\nfeel we have some degree of stewardship. It is not only what is small that is\nbeautiful, it is what is ecological that is beautiful, what is human that is\nbeautiful.\n\nWhat is important is not only that a technology is appropriate. As I have said\nbefore: the Atomic Energy Commission is absolutely convinced that nuclear\npower plants are appropriate technology\u2014to the Atomic Energy Commission. The\nB1 bombers are very appropriate technology\u2014to the Air Force.\n\nWhat I am concerned with is, again, what is liberatory, what is ecological. We\nhave to bring these value-charged words, and we have to bring these value-\ncharged concepts into our thinking, or else we will become mere physicists,\ndealing with dead matter and dealing with people as though they are mere\nobjects to be manipulated, in spaceships, or to be connected through various\nforms of electronic devices, or subject to world games, or finally, set adrift\non a raft or a lifeboat in which they kick off anyone who threatens to eat\ntheir biscuits or threatens to drink their distilled water\u2014and that becomes\necofascism. That becomes ecofascism, and it horrifies me to think that\nanything ecological\u2014even that word \u2018eco\u2019\u2014could be attached to fascism.\n\nFirst and foremost, we must go back to the utopian tradition, in the richest\nsense of the word. Not to the electronic tradition, not to the tradition of\nNASA, not to the tradition of Sir Isaac Newton, in which the whole world was a\nmachine or a watch.\n\nYou can travel all over the country and learn nothing, because you\u2019re carrying\nsomething that\u2019s very important with you, that will decide whether you learn\nor not, and that is: yourself. Move to California tomorrow, and if you\u2019ve\nstill got the same psychological and spiritual and intellectual problems,\nyou\u2019ll be sweating it out in San Francisco no differently than you do in\nAmherst or New York. That is the important thing\u2014to recover yourself, to begin\nto create a community. And what kind of community imagination can begin to\ncreate.\n\nWhat does it mean to be utopian?\n\n\u2018Imagination to power\u2019, as the French students said. \u2018Be practical, do the\nimpossible\u2019, because if you don\u2019t do the impossible, as I\u2019ve cried out over\nand over again, we\u2019re going to wind up with the unthinkable\u2014and that will be\nthe destruction of the planet itself. So to do the impossible is the most\nrational and practical thing we can do. And that impossible is both in our own\nconviction and in our shared conviction with our brothers and sisters, to\nbegin to try to create, or work toward a very distinct notion of what\nconstitutes a finally truly liberated as well as ecological society. A utopian\nnotion, not a futuristic notion.\n\nIt finally means this: that we have to begin to develop ecological\ncommunities. Not just an ecological society\u2014ecological communities, made up of\ncomparatively small numbers of groups, and beautiful communities spaced apart\nfrom each other so that you could almost walk to them, not merely have to get\ninto a car and travel sixty or seventy miles to reach them. It means that we\nhave to reopen the land and reuse it again to create organic garden beds, and\nlearn how to develop a new agriculture in which we\u2019ll all participate in the\nhorticulture.\n\nIf you don\u2019t do the impossible, we\u2019re going to wind up with the\nunthinkable\u2014and that will be the destruction of the planet itself.\n\nWe have to look into communities that we can take into a single view, as\nAristotle said more than 2200 years ago\u2014and we have yet to learn a great deal\nfrom the Greeks, despite all their shortcomings as slave-owners and as\npatriarchs\u2014a community that we can take into a single view, so that we can\nknow each other. Not a community in which we know each other not by virtue of\nsitting around and talking over the telephone, or listening to some honcho\ntalk over a microphone, or listening to some bigger honcho talk over a\ntelevision screen. It has to be done by sitting around in communities, in\nthose town meetings, and in those structures which we have here in the United\nStates as part of the legacy, at least\u2014the best legacy of the United\nStates\u2014and start thinking utopian in the fullest sense of the word.\n\nWe have also to develop our own technologies. We can\u2019t let other people simply\nbuild them for us. They can\u2019t be transported from God knows where to us. We\nhave to know how to fix our faucets, and create our own collectives. We have\nto become richly diversified human beings. We have to be capable of doing many\ndifferent things. We have to be farmer-citizens and citizen-farmers. We have\nto recover the ideal that even a Ben Franklin\u2014who by no means can be regarded,\nin my opinion anyway, as anything slightly more than a philistine\u2014believed in\nthe 18th century: you can both print and read, and when you printed, you read\nwhat you printed. That\u2019s what we have to bring to ourselves. We have to think\nnot in terms, merely, of change; we have to think in terms of growth. We have\nto use the language of ecology so that we can touch each other with the magic\nof words and communicate with each other, with the magic and the richness of\nconcepts, not of catchphrases that are really snappy [snaps fingers]\u2014\u2019input\u2019,\n\u2018output\u2019.\u2019Dialogue\u2019 is longer, but it has a beautiful ring to it. Dia logos,\nspeech between two, talking between two. Logos\u2014logic, reasoning out\ncreatively, dialectically, and growing through conversation, and growing\nthrough communication. This is what I mean by utopia. We have to go back to\nFourier, who said that measure of a society\u2019s oppression could be determined\nby the way it treats its women. It was not Marx who said that, it was Charles\nFourier.... We have to go back to the rich tradition of the New England town\nmeeting, and all that was healthy in it and recover that and learn a new type\nof confederalism.\n\nToday, the real movements of the future insofar as they are utopian in their\noutlook\u2014insofar as they are trying to create not an extension of the present,\nbut trying to create something that is truly new, that alone can rescue life,\nhuman spirit, as well as the ecology of this planet\u2014must be built around a\nnew, rich communication, not between leader and led\u2014but between student and\nteacher, so that every student can eventually become a teacher, and not a\ndictator, a governor, a controller and a manipulator.\n\nAnd above all, we have to think organically. We have to think organically\u2014not\nelectronically. We have to think in terms of life and biology, not in terms of\nwatches and physics. We have to think in terms of what is human, not what is\nmerely small or big, because that alone will be beautiful. Any society that\nseeks to create utopia will not only be a society that is free, it also has to\nbe a society that is beautiful. There can no longer be any separation\u2014any more\nthan between mind and body\u2014between art and the development of a free society.\nWe must become artists now, not only ecologists, utopians. Not futurists, not\nenvironmentalists.\n\n[applause]\n\nMurray Bookchin was asked two relevant questions from the audience, which were\ninaudible in the recording. The first questioner asked if he was against\ntechnology.\n\nMurray Bookchin: No, that is not at all true. I see a very great use for\ntechnology. What I\u2019m talking about is a technocracy. What I\u2019m talking about is\nrule by technicians. What I\u2019m talking about is the use of various types of\ntechnological devices that are inhuman to people and inhuman in their scale,\nand cannot be controlled by people. The beauty of an ecological technology\u2014an\necotechnology, or a liberatory technology, or an alternative technology\u2014is\nthat people can understand it if they are willing to try to devote some degree\nof effort to doing so. It\u2019s simplicity, wherever possible, it\u2019s small-scale,\nwherever possible. That\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m not talking about going\nback to the paleolithic, I\u2019m not talking about going back into caves. We\ncannot go back to that and I don\u2019t think we want to go back to that.\n\nIn the next question from the audience, Bookchin is asked to, very concretely,\ndescribe his political vision. There is laughter after the question.\n\nI\u2019m going to be really hard rocks about this and get down to it and not just\ntell you that I\u2019m giving you some vague philosophical principles. I would like\nto see communities, food cooperatives, affinity groups, all these types of\nstructures\u2014town meetings developed all over the United States. I\u2019d like to see\nneighborhood organizations, non-hierarchical in their form, developed all over\nthe United States, from New York City to San Francisco, from rural Vermont to\nurban California. When these particular organizations develop rapidly and\nconfederate, at first regionally, and hopefully, nationally, and perhaps even\ninternationally\u2014because we are no longer talking about the United States\nalone, we\u2019re even talking about what\u2019s going on in the Soviet Union to a very\ngreat extent\u2014I hope they will then, through one way or another, by example and\nthrough education win the majority of people to this sensibility. And having\ndone this, demand that society be changed, and then afterward we\u2019ll have to\nface whatever we have to face. The only alternative we have after that, if we\ndon\u2019t do that, will be as follows: we will be organized into bureaucracies,\nbureaucracies in the name of progress, as well as bureaucracies in the name of\nreaction, as well as bureaucracies in the name of the status quo. And if we\u2019re\norganized in the form of these bureaucracies, whether we use solar power or\nnerve gas, it makes no difference, we\u2019re going to wind up, ultimately, with\nthe same thing. In fact, the idea that solar power or wind power or methane is\ntoday being used instead of fossil fuels, will merely become an excuse for\nmaintaining the same multinational, corporate, and hierarchical system that we\nhave today.\n\nSo I propose that those types of organizations, and those types of social\nforms, be developed all over the country, and increasingly hopefully affect\nthe majority of opinion, to a point where the American people, in one way or\nanother, make their voices heard, because they are the overwhelming majority,\nand say they want to change the society. And if America turns over, the whole\nworld will change, in my personal opinion. Because this happens to be the\ncenter, literally the keystone of what I would call the whole capitalistic\nsystem that today envelops the world, whether it be China, Cuba and Russia, or\nwhether it be the United States, Canada and Western Europe. That is, very\nconcretely, what I propose.\n\nDaydreams are dangerous. They are pieces of imagination, they are bits of\npoetry. They are the balloons that fly up in history.\n\nI\u2019d like to make this very clear, the American people first will begin to\nchange unconsciously, before they change consciously. You\u2019ll go around to them\nand you\u2019ll say, what do you think of work? And they\u2019ll say it\u2019s noble. You\u2019ll\nask them what do you think of property? And they\u2019ll say it\u2019s sacred. And\nyou\u2019ll ask them, what do they think of motherhood, they\u2019ll say it\u2019s grand,\nit\u2019s godly. What do you think of religion and they\u2019ll say they belong to it\nand they are completely devoted to it. You\u2019ll ask them, what do they think of\nAmerica, and they\u2019ll say, either love it or leave it. You\u2019ll say, what do you\nthink of the flag and they\u2019ll say it\u2019s glorious, Old Glory.\n\nBut then one day something is going to happen. One day, the unconscious, the\nexpectation, the dream, the imagination, the hope that you go to bed with as\nyou sink into the twilight hours of sleep, or the early morning when you\ndaydream, just after the alarm clock has gone off and you\u2019ve shut it\ndown\u2014those expectations and dreams that lie buried in the unconscious mind of\nmillions upon millions of American people are going to break right into\nconsciousness. And when they break right into consciousness, heaven help this\nsociety. [audience cheers] I\u2019m very serious.\n\nThat is the strange catalysis, the strange process of education; everyone\ntoday is schizophrenic, we\u2019re all leading double lives, and we know it. And\nnot only are we leading double lives, those ordinary\u2014so-called\n\u2018ordinary\u2019\u2014people out there are also leading double lives. And one day, that\ndouble life is going to become one life. Maybe it\u2019ll be for the worse. But\nmaybe it\u2019ll be for the better. At that particular point, maybe something like\nMay, June 1968 in Paris will start. All over the place, all kinds of flags\nwill go up that don\u2019t look like the flag we\u2019re accustomed to seeing. [laughter\nfrom audience] Maybe black or red, I don\u2019t know. At that particular point,\nmillions of people will stop working, and they\u2019ll start discussing.\n\nThen you\u2019ll have that terrifying situation called mob rule. But that will\nhappen, and that\u2019s what happened here in 1776, they believed in the King,\nright up until July 1776. In the meantime, they were having doubts. They\ndidn\u2019t even know they didn\u2019t like the monarchy. But one day they woke up and\nsaid, the hell with King George. And they ran ahead, and they wrote the\nDeclaration of Independence, and it was read to the troops. At that particular\npoint, the Union Jack went down and the Stars and Stripes went up. This is the\nway people actually change. People change unconsciously before they change\nconsciously. They begin to float dreams\u2014daydreams are dangerous. Daydreams are\npieces of imagination, they are bits of poetry. They are the balloons that fly\nup in history.\n\nTranscribed and edited by Constanze Huther.\n\nMurray Bookchin was a political theorist, philosopher, and activist. He\ndeveloped the philosophy of social ecology and the political theory of\nlibertarian municipalism, or communalism, which has influenced the growing\n\u2018municipalist\u2019 movement around the world. He was the co-founder of the\nInstitute for Social Ecology, which is still active today. Bookchin died in\n2006.
