The most common type of levitation occurs through magnetic\nfields. Objects such as superconductors or diamagnetic materials (materials\nrepelled by a magnetic field) can be made to float above magnets to develop\nadvanced sensors for various scientific and everyday uses.\n\nProf. Jason Twamley, head of the unit, and his team of OIST researchers and\ninternational collaborators, have designed a floating platform within a vacuum\nusing graphite and magnets. Remarkably, this levitating platform operates\nwithout relying on external power sources and can assist in the development of\nultra-sensitive sensors for highly precise and efficient measurements. Their\nresults have been published in the journal Applied Physics Letters.\n\nWhen an external magnetic field is applied to \u2018diamagnetic\u2019 materials, these\nmaterials generate a magnetic field in the opposite direction, resulting in a\nrepulsive force \u2013 they push away from the field. Therefore, objects made of\ndiamagnetic materials can float above strong magnetic fields. For instance, in\nmaglev trains, powerful superconducting magnets create a strong magnetic field\nwith diamagnetic materials to achieve levitation, seemingly defying gravity.\n\nGraphite, the crystalline form of carbon found in pencils, is strongly\nrepelled by magnets (highly diamagnetic). By chemically coating a powder of\nmicroscopic graphite beads with silica and mixing the coated powder in wax,\nthe researchers formed a centimeter-sized thin square plate which hovers above\nmagnets arranged in a grid pattern.\n\nCreating a floating platform that requires no external power has several\nchallenges. The biggest limiting factor is \u2018eddy damping\u2019 which occurs when an\noscillating system loses energy over time because of external forces. When an\nelectrical conductor, like graphite, passes through a powerful magnetic field,\nit experiences energy loss due to the flow of electrical currents. This energy\nloss has discouraged the use of magnetic levitation to develop advanced\nsensors.\n\nOIST scientists set out to engineer a platform that can float and oscillate\nwithout losing energy \u2014 meaning that once set in motion, it will continue\noscillating for an extended period, even without additional energy input. This\ntype of \u2018frictionless\u2019 platform could have many applications, including new\ntypes of sensors for measuring force, acceleration, and gravity.\n\nHowever, even if scientists manage to decrease eddy damping, there is another\nchallenge: minimizing the motional (kinetic) energy of the oscillating\nplatform. Lowering this energy level is important for two reasons. First, it\nmakes the platform more sensitive for use as a sensor. Second, cooling its\nmotion toward the quantum regime (where quantum effects dominate) could open\nnew possibilities for precision measurements. Therefore, to achieve a truly\nfrictionless, self-sustaining floating platform both eddy damping and motional\nenergy challenges need to be solved.\n\nTo address these, the researchers focused on creating a new material derived\nfrom graphite. By chemically changing it, they transformed graphite into an\nelectrical insulator. This change stops energy losses, while allowing the\nmaterial to levitate in a vacuum.\n\nThe scientists chemically coated each graphite particle with a layer of\nelectrically insulating silica. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) helps silica bind to\nthe surface of the graphite. The coated graphite particles are mixed with wax\nand shaped into insulating diamagnetic slabs.\n\nA scanning electron microscope image of the coated graphite microbeads. Green\nregions indicate silicon and confirm the presence of the insulating coating.\n\nThe graphite composite plate wiggles above the magnets for a long time but\nloses energy over time due to air friction.\n\nIn their experimental setup, the scientists continuously monitored the\nplatform\u2019s motion. Using this real-time information, they applied a feedback\nmagnetic force to dampen the platform\u2019s motion \u2013 essentially, cooling down its\nmovement and slowing it down significantly.\n\n\u201cHeat causes motion, but by continuously monitoring and providing real-time\nfeedback in the form of corrective actions to the system, we can decrease this\nmovement. The feedback adjusts the system\u2019s damping rate, which is how quickly\nit loses energy, so by actively controlling the damping, we reduce the\nsystem\u2019s kinetic energy, effectively cooling it down,\u201d Prof. Twamley\nexplained.\n\nThe slab hovers over a pattern of alternating north and south pole magnets.\nThe system is isolated from vibrations and maintained in a high-vacuum\nenvironment. A mirror is used to monitor the vertical motion (position and\nvelocity) of the slab and a feedback loop is used to decrease its motion.\n\n\u201cIf cooled sufficiently, our levitating platform could outperform even the\nmost sensitive atomic gravimeters developed to date. These are cutting-edge\ninstruments that use the behavior of atoms to precisely measure gravity.\nAchieving this level of precision requires rigorous engineering to isolate the\nplatform from external disturbances such as vibrations, magnetic fields, and\nelectrical noise. Our ongoing work focuses on refining these systems to unlock\nthe full potential of this technology.\u201d\n\nProf. Twamley\u2019s unit focuses on using levitating materials to build mechanical\noscillators \u2013 systems that have repetitive or periodic motion around a central\npoint. These oscillations occur in various contexts, such as pendulums, masses\nconnected to springs and acoustic systems. This research opens exciting\npossibilities for ultra-sensitive sensors and achieving precise control over\noscillating platforms. By combining levitation, insulation, and real-time\nfeedback, Prof. Twamley\u2019s team are pushing the boundaries of what is\nachievable in materials science and sensor technology.\n\nDate:\n\n08 April 2024\n\nCategory:\n\nResearch Update\n\nCreator\n\nMerle Naidoo\n\nArticle Information\n\nTitle:\n\nFeedback cooling of an insulating high-Q diamagnetically levitated plate\n\nJournal:\n\nApplied Physics Letters\n\nAuthor(s):\n\nS.
