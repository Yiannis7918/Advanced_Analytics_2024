[Click for more info] The Pyra is only 13,9 x 8,7 x 3,2cm big.\nIt fits your pockets.\n\nClick here to preorder!\n\nThe most feature-rich ultra portable Mini Computer\n\nYou will not find as many ports on other this small mobile systems\n\nThese days, mobile devices only offer one, maybe two ports. The Pyra is\ndifferent.\n\nIt features one USB 3.0 OTG port, two full-sized USB 2.0 ports (one has\nadditional SATA output, available via an adapter), one Micro-USB Serial\nOutput-Port (which can also be used to charge the system), a headset port\n(that supports ALL TRRS standards) and a MicroHDMI port.\n\nYou can easily connect a mouse, keyboard and monitor without any additional\nhardware and use it as a desktop PC!\n\nThere are things we're missing these days.\n\nSmart users are not blind to the shortcomings of \"smart\" devices.\n\nPhysical keyboards and replaceable batteries don't really extract profits out\nof the pockets of users, keep your money and reach for a useful device, far\ninto the future.\n\nA 6000mAh battery means you have a companion that will be there for you,\nthrough use and at times other devices have given up long ago.\n\nBelow the battery you will find a MicroSDXC slot (and a SIM-Card slot for the\n4G/LTE version), meaning it's easy to experiment with different operating\nsystems, or expand upon the 32GB internal storage.\n\nThe mobile edition adds mobile internet, and also has telephony services\n(making the Pyra a phone), it also adds GPS, a 6-axis digital compass, a\npressure-, humidity- and gas -sensor.\n\nGo wherever you want.\n\nInto the future\n\nThe Pyra is built to be modular.\n\nIt consists of not one, but three circuit boards.\n\n* The CPU-Board (CPU, RAM and storage) * The Mainboard (all ports, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth) * The Display-Board (for the screen)\n\nEngineering, design and craftsmanship manufacture done in Germany.\n\nBuy a new board for updates, not a whole new device. Beneficial for both you\nand the environment.\n\nSecure, open and friendly!\n\nTake pride in something done the right way.\n\nYou get the full schematics. No secrets.\n\nAnd that screwdriver you own, use it to open hack and fix your device.\n\nYour privacy is yours. We collect nothing, no account is needed to fully use\nthe Pyra. This also means there is nothing to upsell later, up-front a more\nexpensive way to do it, but without any hidden costs.\n\nLong time support. The Pandora, which appeared in 2008, still received updates\n8 years later, and some users are still updating it!\n\nReplacement parts are still available for the Pandora. The same will be true\nfor the Pyra.\n\nAwesome community, join in the discussion and development.\n\nThe Pyra is upon us!\n\nOver 150 units have already been shipped to the users.\n\nWhile assembly itself still is a bit slow due to some issues we had with the\ncase, we are working on improving the speed and fixing these issues in the\nnear future. We already have over 500 full boards produced, so we can still\nassemble over 300 before the next PCB production run is needed.\n\nWe have around 1000 preorders, so it will still take a while until all of\nthese are delivered, but we're getting there!\n\nAdditionally, we also are looking into a new CPU for the next upgrade!\n\nThe downpayment from the preorder allows us to order the needed parts upfront.\nBetter for everyone.\n\nFollow the process and get the latest news, visit our forum blog!\n\nMuch to do with the Pyra\n\nPlay games, get work done, listen to music, use it as a photography asset. The\nPyra has unique features in all these areas. Debian GNU/Linux means even your\noldest relative can figure out how to browse the web, watch videos, do office\nwork, and edit photos. Firefox, Thunderbird, ClawsMail, Transmission, VLC,\nLibreOffice, GIMP and thousands of other tools can be downloaded within the\noperating system, it even takes care of updating them and keeping you secure.\n\nIf you want to get fancy, code, compile, port games and create websites to\nyour hearts content. GNU/Linux is faster than Android. The Pandora can already\nplay games like Diablo II, Call To Power II, Jedi Knight, or Return to Castle\nWolfenstein. It can even do fullspeed emulation of many arcade games and most\nsystems up to 2004. The Pyra is much faster. It might not be as fast as the\ncurrent x86 Mini PCs or latest generation smartphones, but it's fully open,\nhackable and a very unique niche device.\n\nPyra in the Press:\n\nDragonbox Pyra by ericomont on Sketchfab\n\nHosting Advice Pandora Live Liliputing Geeky Gadgets Obscure Handhelds Open\nConsoles News (French) The Verge Phoronix HW Upgrade (Italian) root.cz (Czech)\nReddit Bitcoin YCombinator Hup.hu (Hungarian) Circuit Board (German)\nTechnology Craze TechNews.tw (Chinese) Reddit LinuxAction Wikipedia Pro-Linux\n(German) Shard Labs\n\nGot questions?
