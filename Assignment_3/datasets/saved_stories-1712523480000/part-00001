I am currently building two products: Keep it Shot, which went\nviral and reached $3,000 in revenue with over $220 in MRR, and BrainMimic. I\nlaunched BrainMimic two days ago, born out of frustration I faced with Keep it\nShot support. It also made its first sale on day one.\n\nHere is a story of how I got the idea for Keep it Shot, What stack I used, How\nit went Viral.\n\n##\n\nIdeation:\n\nI was building a video-based search engine for lecture videos. Looking back, I\ndon't think anybody would have used it. In the process of building it, I\nconverted videos into images, renamed them using AI, extracted text, generated\ndescriptions, and built a semantic index. I used the same script to rename my\nscreenshots too. And I thought, wow, if I'm being honest with myself, this\nscreenshot renaming thing provided more value than the video search engine,\nwhich I may have used rarely. But this screenshot renamer, I will use it\ndaily.\n\n##\n\nStack:\n\nI dropped everything and decided to quickly build this thing in 10 days, but\nthere was only one problem: I am not good at Swift, but I am comfortable with\nRust. So, I naturally went with Tauri. It was super easy to build; their\ndocumentation was straightforward, and the bundle size, without including the\ntranscription model (Video renaming), was just less than 20MB. This comes from\nsomeone who has used Electron.\n\n##\n\nLaunch:\n\nOnce I finished the product, I quickly posted it on Reddit and I saw many\npeople asking for a one-time-use software that they could use with their own\nkey. Although I was half-hearted about this, it kind of made sense to\nconsider. So, I started working on it. However, my scheduled Product Hunt\nlaunch went live automatically the very next day. In fact, I reached out to\nthe PH team to postpone the launch. I am glad they did not postpone because\nthe demo video was tweeted from their Twitter account, which received 900+\nlikes, then was picked up by some big Telegram channels with millions of\nfollowers. The traffic alone took the site down (tiny EC2). But remember, at\nthis point, I still had not released the one-time package.\n\nBut after 2 days, I fixed all the important bugs and released the one-time\npackage with the option to use their own key, and emailed all my users. At\nthis point, I had sold a few LTDs and subscription plans; there were like\n2000+ users. I was surprised to see that right after I sent the email, sales\nstarted happening.\n\nAs of right now here are my stats:\n\nUsers: 3000+\n\nRevenue: $3,100+\n\nMRR: $220\n\nStripe Screenshot:\n\nAs you can see from the graph, the sales dropped. So yeah, the viral part is\njust luck. Now, I need to do actual marketing work.\n\nHey, if you like this type of content, please do consider subscribing. This\nwill encourage me to write more.\n\nChartMogul MRR:\n\n##\n\nSolving my next painful problem:\n\nAfter Keep it Shot got attention I spent next three straight days on customer\nsupport, emails, repeating the same thing again and again. I've tried tools\nlike templated/canned responses, but many times users ask two questions where\nI have answers separated in two different places; templated responses did not\nreally work, and I am not good at remembering shortcuts.\n\nThat's when I built BrainMimic, which launched 2 days ago. It is a browser\nextension that enables you to add content from your email or any site by\nselecting and saving it. This allows you to write grounded emails, Slack\nmessages, or input on any site with just one click, without the need for any\nadditional prompts. Also launched on ProductHunt, and I can't believe they\nwrote six whole paragraphs just about me and the product in their newsletter.\n\n##\n\nConclusion:\n\nOver the years, I have built numerous products, but if I have to choose the\nones that truly made money, they would be the products designed to solve my\nown problems\u2014something that did not exist in the market.\n\nThank you for reading.
