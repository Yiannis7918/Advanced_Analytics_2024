The advertising is\npresented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change\nactions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that\nthey are in an urban zone.\n\nA large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online\nadvertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its\naudience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and\navoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles\nabout how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been\npresented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often.\n\nVendors we use for this purpose42 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * Adform\n  * Advanced store\n  * Amazon Ad Server\n  * Appier\n  * AudienceProject\n  * Bannernow\n\n1-10 of 42\n\nCreate profiles for personalised advertising\n\nInformation about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit,\ncontent you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about\nyou (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and\nother websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or\nimprove a profile about you (that might include possible interests and\npersonal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present\nadvertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by\nthis and other entities.\n\nIf you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this\ninformation could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike\naccessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a\ndifferent website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike\naccessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury\ncar manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your\ninterest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are\ninterested in luxury cycling gear.\n\nAn apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It\ngets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income\ncustomers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create\nprofiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to\nhave a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising\nwithin partner apps based on those profiles.\n\nVendors we use for this purpose129 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * A.Mob\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdElement Media Solutions\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * AdSpirit AdServer\n  * AdTheorent\n  * AdTiming\n\n1-10 of 129\n\nUse profiles to select personalised advertising\n\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising\nprofiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or\napps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and\npersonal aspects.\n\nAn online retailer wants to advertise a limited sale on running shoes. It\nwants to target advertising to users who previously looked at running shoes on\nits mobile app. Tracking technologies might be used to recognise that you have\npreviously used the mobile app to consult running shoes, in order to present\nyou with the corresponding advertisement on the app.\n\nA profile created for personalised advertising in relation to a person having\nsearched for bike accessories on a website can be used to present the relevant\nadvertisement for bike accessories on a mobile app of another organisation.\n\nVendors we use for this purpose127 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * A.Mob\n  * ADventori\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdElement Media Solutions\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * AdSpirit AdServer\n  * AdTheorent\n\n1-10 of 127\n\nMeasure advertising performance\n\nInformation regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you\ninteract with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for\nyou or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For\ninstance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you\nto buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand\nthe relevance of advertising campaigns.\n\nYou have clicked on an advertisement about a \u201cblack Friday\u201d discount by an\nonline shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click\nwill be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will\nbe measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.\n\nYou are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an\n\u201cinternational appreciation day\u201d discount by an online gift shop within the\napp of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how\noften a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the \u201cinternational\nappreciation day\u201d ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in\norder to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad\nplacements.\n\nVendors we use for this purpose76 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * Adelaide\n  * Adform\n  * Adikteev\n  * Adloox\n  * Adnami\n\n1-10 of 76\n\nUnderstand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different\nsources\n\nReports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user\nprofiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your\ninteractions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising)\ncontent to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which\ntarget audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).\n\nThe owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the\nproportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or\nconsulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as\nthe average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data\nrelating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics\nis then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.\n\nAn advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with\nits adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics\nof users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of\nsimilar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the\nadvertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile\ndevices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.\n\nVendors we use for this purpose28 vendor(s)\n\n  * AdGear\n  * Amazon Ad Server\n  * Amobee (Nexxen)\n  * Appier\n  * AudienceProject\n  * Bombora\n  * Clinch\n  * Crimtan\n  * Emerse\n  * Google Ads\n\n1-10 of 28\n\nDevelop and improve services\n\nInformation about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with\nads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to\nbuild new products and services based on user interactions, the type of\naudience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or\nimprovement of user profiles and identifiers.\n\nA technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in\nmobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are\nconnecting through mobile connections. It uses a new technology to deliver ads\nthat are formatted for mobile devices and that are low-bandwidth, to improve\ntheir performance.\n\nAn advertiser is looking for a way to display ads on a new type of consumer\ndevice.

COMPLAINT In 2010, a top\nApple executive emailed Apple's then-CEO about an ad for the new Kindle\ne-reader. The ad began with a woman who was using her iPhone to buy and read\nbooks on the Kindle app. She then switches to an Android smartphone and\ncontinues to read her books using the same Kindle app. The executive wrote to\nJobs: one \"message that can't be missed is that it is easy to switch from\niPhone to Android. Not fun to watch.\" Jobs was clear in his response: Apple\nwould \"force\" developers to use its payment system to lock in both developers\nand users on its platform. Over many years, Apple has repeatedly responded to\ncompetitive threats like this one by making it harder or more expensive for\nits users and developers to leave than by making it more attractive for them\nto stay. For many years, Apple has built a dominant iPhone platform and\necosystem that has driven the company's astronomical valuation. At the same\ntime, it has long understood that disruptive technologies and innovative apps,\nproducts, and services threatened that dominance by making users less reliant\non the iPhone or making it easier to switch to a non-Apple smartphone. Rather\nthan respond to competitive threats by offering lower smartphone prices to\nconsumers or better monetization for developers, Apple would meet competitive\nthreats by imposing a series of shapeshifting rules and restrictions in its\nApp Store guidelines and developer agreements that would allow Apple to\nextract higher fees, thwart innovation, offer a less secure or degraded user\nexperience, and throttle competitive alternatives. It has deployed this\nplaybook 3\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 4 of 88 PageID: 4 across\nmany technologies, products, and services, including super apps, text\nmessaging, smartwatches, and digital wallets, among many others. Apple's\nconduct also stifles new paradigms that threaten Apple's smartphone dominance,\nincluding the cloud, which could make it easier for users to enjoy high-end\nfunctionality on a lower priced smartphone- -or make users device-agnostic\naltogether. As one Apple manager recently observed, \u201cImagine buying a\n[expletive] Android for 25 bux at a garage sale and it works fine.... And you\nhave a solid cloud computing device. Imagine how many cases like that there\nare.\" Simply put, Apple feared the disintermediation of its iPhone platform\nand undertook a course of conduct that locked in users and developers while\nprotecting its profits. Critically, Apple's anticompetitive conduct not only\nlimits competition in the smartphone market, but also reverberates through the\nindustries that are affected by these restrictions, including financial\nservices, fitness, gaming, social media, news media, entertainment, and more.\nUnless Apple's anticompetitive and exclusionary conduct is stopped, it will\nlikely extend and entrench its iPhone monopoly to other markets and parts of\nthe economy. For example, Apple is rapidly expanding its influence and growing\nits power in the automotive, content creation and entertainment, and financial\nservices industries-and often by doing so in exclusionary ways that further\nreinforce and deepen the competitive moat around the iPhone. This case is\nabout freeing smartphone markets from Apple's anticompetitive and exclusionary\nconduct and restoring competition to lower smartphone prices for consumers,\nreducing fees for developers, and preserving innovation for the future. The\nUnited States and the States of New Jersey, Arizona, California, Connecticut,\nMaine, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, North Dakota, Oklahoma,\nOregon, Tennessee, Vermont, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia, acting by\nand through their respective 4\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 5 of 88 PageID: 5 Attorneys\nGeneral, bring this case to address Apple's anticompetitive and exclusionary\nconduct and alleviate harm to competition. I. Introduction The Apple Computer\nCompany, as it was then called, was founded in 1976 to make and market\npersonal computers. From its inception, Apple had a knack for expensive, high-\nend design and niche marketing relative to its competitors. But it struggled\nto compete against rivals that offered lower prices and more programs. After\ntwo decades, Apple struggled to compete against Windows personal computers and\nby the late 1990s, it was on the brink of bankruptcy. 1. Apple's fortunes\nchanged around the time it launched the iPod in 2001. Innovative design and\nsavvy marketing had not been enough to drive a successful business strategy.\nThis time, the confluence of several factors made it a smash success. Apple's\niTunes application allowed iPod users to organize their song library and\nupdate their iPod. A pathclearing antitrust enforcement case, brought by the\nUnited States and state attorneys general, against Microsoft opened the market\nand constrained Microsoft's ability to prohibit companies like Apple from\noffering iTunes on Windows PCs. Licensing agreements with the major music\nlabels allowed Apple to offer iPod/iTunes users a wide selection of music for\na fee-perdownload. The iPod experience gave Apple a recipe for the future: a\nhigh-end device, a large number of platform participants (i.e., music labels\nand consumers), and a digital storefront. More importantly, it gave Apple a\nplaybook: drive as many consumers and third-party participants to the platform\nas possible and offer a wide selection of content, products, and services\ncreated by those third parties to consumers. This structure put Apple in the\ndriver's seat to generate substantial revenues through device sales in the\nfirst instance and subsequently the ancillary fees 2. 5\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 6 of 88 PageID: 6 that it\nderives from sitting between consumers on the one hand and the products and\nservices they love on the other. 3. Apple's experience with the iPod set the\nstage for Apple's most successful product yet. In 2007, Apple launched the\niPhone, a smartphone that offered high-end hardware and software applications,\ncalled \u201capps,\u201d built atop a mobile operating system that mimicked the\nfunctionality and ease of use of a computer. Apple initially offered only a\nsmall number of apps that it created for the iPhone. But Apple quickly\nrealized the enormous value that a broader community of entrepreneurial,\ninnovative developers could drive to its users and the iPhone platform more\nbroadly. So Apple invited and capitalized on the work of these third parties\nwhile maintaining control and monetizing that work for itself. The value of\nthird parties' work served an important purpose for Apple. Indeed, as early as\n2010, then-CEO Steve Jobs discussed how to \"further lock customers into our\necosystem\u201d and \u201cmake Apple['s] ecosystem even more sticky.\" Three years later,\nApple executives were still strategizing how to \"get people hooked to the\necosystem.\" That strategy paid off. Over more than 15 years, Apple has built\nand sustained the most dominant smartphone platform and ecosystem in the\nUnited States by attracting third-party developers of all kinds to create apps\nthat users could download on their smartphones through a digital storefront\ncalled the App Store. As developers created more and better products, content,\napps, and services, more people bought iPhones, which incentivized even more\nthird parties to develop apps for the iPhone. Today, the iPhone's ecosystem\nincludes products, apps, content, accessories, and services that are offered\nby content creators, newspaper publishers, banks, advertisers, social media\ncompanies, airlines, productivity developers, retailers and other merchants,\nand others. As Apple's power grew, its leverage over third parties reinforced\nits tight 4. 6\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 7 of 88 PageID: 7 control\nover how third parties innovate and monetize on and off the smartphone in ways\nthat were anticompetitive and exclusionary. 5. Today, Apple charges as much as\n$1,599 for an iPhone and earns high margins on each one, more than double\nthose of others in the industry. When developers imagine a new product or\nservice for iPhone consumers, Apple demands up to 30 percent of the price of\nan app whose content, product, or service it did not create. Then when a\nconsumer wants to buy some additional service within that app, Apple extracts\nup to another 30 percent, again for a service Apple does not create or\ndevelop. When customers buy a coffee or pay for groceries, Apple charges a fee\nfor every \"tap-to-pay\" transaction, imposing its own form of an interchange\nfee on banks and a significant new cost for using credit cards. When users run\nan internet search, Google gives Apple a significant cut of the advertising\nrevenue that an iPhone user's searches generate. 6. Apple keenly understands\nthat while a community of developers and accessory makers is indispensable to\nthe success of the iPhone, they also pose an existential threat to its\nextraordinary profits by empowering consumers to \"think different\" and choose\nperfectly functional, less-expensive alternative smartphones. 7. Apple's\nsmartphone business model, at its core, is one that invites as many\nparticipants, including iPhone users and third-party developers, to join its\nplatform as possible while using contractual terms to force these participants\nto pay substantial fees. At the same time, Apple restricts its platform\nparticipants' ability to negotiate or compete down its fees through\nalternative app stores, in-app payment processors, and more. In order to\nprotect that model, Apple reduces competition in the markets for performance\nsmartphones and smartphones generally. It does this by delaying, degrading, or\n8. 7\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 8 of 88 PageID: 8 outright\nblocking technologies that would increase competition in the smartphone\nmarkets by decreasing barriers to switching to another smartphone, among other\nthings. The suppressed technologies would provide a high-quality user\nexperience on any smartphone, which would, in turn, require smartphones to\ncompete on their merits. 9. Apple suppresses such innovation through a web of\ncontractual restrictions that it selectively enforces through its control of\napp distribution and its \u201capp review\" process, as well as by denying access to\nkey points of connection between apps and the iPhone's operating system\n(called Application Programming Interfaces or \"APIs\"). Apple can enforce these\nrestrictions due to its position as an intermediary between product creators\nsuch as developers on the one hand and users on the other. 10. This complaint\nhighlights five examples of Apple using these mechanisms to suppress\ntechnologies that would have increased competition among smartphones.\nSuppressing these technologies does not reflect competition on the merits.\nRather, to protect its smartphone monopoly and the extraordinary profits that\nmonopoly generates\u2014Apple repeatedly chooses to make its products worse for\nconsumers to prevent competition from emerging. These examples below\nindividually and collectively have contributed to Apple's ability to secure,\ngrow, and maintain its smartphone monopoly by increasing switching costs for\nusers, which leads to higher prices and less innovation for users and\ndevelopers. Apple has used one or both mechanisms (control of app distribution\nor control of APIs) to suppress the following technologies, among others:\nSuper apps provide a user with broad functionality in a single app. Super apps\ncan improve smartphone competition by providing a consistent user experience\nthat can be ported across devices. Suppressing super apps harms all smartphone\nusers\u2014 8\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 9 of 88 PageID: 9 \u25cf \u25cf\nincluding Apple users\u2014by denying them access to high quality experiences and\nit harms developers by preventing them from innovating and selling products.\nCloud streaming game apps provide users with a way to play computing intensive\ngames in the cloud. Cloud streaming games (and cloud streaming in general) can\nimprove smartphone competition by decreasing the importance of expensive\nhardware for accomplishing high compute tasks on a smartphone. Suppressing\ncloud streaming games harms users by denying them the ability to play high-\ncompute games, and it harms developers by preventing them from selling such\ngames to users. Messaging apps are apps that allow users to communicate with\nfriends, family, and other contacts. Messaging apps that work equally well\nacross all smartphones can improve competition among smartphones by allowing\nusers to switch phones without changing the way they communicate with friends,\nfamily, and others. Apple makes third-party messaging apps on the iPhone worse\ngenerally and relative to Apple Messages, Apple's own messaging app, by\nprohibiting third-party apps from sending or receiving carrier-based messages.\nBy doing so, Apple is knowingly and deliberately degrading quality, privacy,\nand security for its users and others who do not have iPhones. Apple also\nharms developers by artificially constraining the size of their user base.\nSmartwatches are an expensive accessory that typically must be paired to a\nsmartphone. Smartwatches that can be paired with different smartphones allow\nusers to retain their investment in a smartwatch when switching phones thereby\ndecreasing the literal cost associated with switching from one smartphone to\nanother, among other things. By suppressing key functions of third-party\nsmartwatches including 9\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 10 of 88 PageID: 10 the\nability to respond to notifications and messages and to maintain consistent\nconnections with the iPhone-Apple has denied users access to high performing\nsmartwatches with preferred styling, better user interfaces and services, or\nbetter batteries, and it has harmed smartwatch developers by decreasing their\nability to innovate and sell products. Digital wallets are an increasingly\nimportant way that smartphones are used and are a product in which users\ndevelop a great deal of comfort and trust as they typically contain users'\nmost sensitive information. Digital wallets that work across smartphone\nplatforms allow users to move from one smartphone brand to another with\ndecreased frictions, among other things. Apple has denied users access to\ndigital wallets that would have provided a wide variety of enhanced features\nand denied digital wallet developers\u2014often banks\u2014the opportunity to provide\nadvanced digital payments services to their own customers. By maintaining its\nmonopoly over smartphones, Apple is able to harm consumers in a wide variety\nof additional ways. For example, by denying iPhone users the ability to choose\ntheir trusted banking apps as their digital wallet, Apple retains full control\nboth over the consumer and also over the stream of income generated by forcing\nusers to use only Appleauthorized products in the digital wallet. Apple also\nprohibits the creation and use of alternative app stores curated to reflect a\nconsumer's preferences with respect to security, privacy, or other values.\nThese and many other features would be beneficial to consumers and empower\nthem to make choices about what smartphone to buy and what apps and products\nto patronize. But allowing consumers to make that choice is an obstacle to\nApple's ability to maintain its monopoly. 11. 10\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 11 of 88 PageID: 11 12. Of\ncourse, this is not the story Apple presents to the world. For decades, Apple\nbranded itself a nimble, innovative upstart. In 1998, Apple co-founder Steve\nJobs criticized Microsoft's monopoly and \"dirty tactics\" in operating systems\nto target Apple, which prompted the company \"to go to the Department of\nJustice\u201d in hopes of getting Microsoft \"to play fair.\u201d But even at that time,\nApple did not face the same types of restrictions it imposes on third parties\ntoday; Apple users could use their iPod with a Windows computer, and Microsoft\ndid not charge Apple a 30 percent fee for each song downloaded from Apple's\niTunes store. Similarly, when Apple brought the iPhone to market in 2007, it\nbenefited from competition among component makers and wireless carriers. 13.\nWhile Apple's anticompetitive conduct arguably has benefited its shareholders\u2014\nto the tune of over $77 billion in stock buybacks in its 2023 fiscal year\nalone it comes at a great cost to consumers. Some of those costs are immediate\nand obvious, and they directly affect Apple's own customers: Apple inflates\nthe price for buying and using iPhones while preventing the development of\nfeatures like alternative app stores, innovative super apps, cloud-streaming\ngames, and secure texting. 14. Other costs of Apple's anticompetitive conduct\nmay be less obvious in the immediate term. But they are no less harmful and\neven more widespread, affecting all smartphone consumers. Apple's smartphone\nmonopoly means that it is not economically viable to invest in building some\napps, like digital wallets, because they cannot reach iPhone users. This means\nthat innovations fueled by an interest in building the best, most user-focused\nproduct that would exist in a more competitive market never get off the\nground. What's more, Apple itself has less incentive to innovate because it\nhas insulated itself from competition. As Apple's executives openly\nacknowledge: \"In looking at it with hindsight, I think going forward we need\n11\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 12 of 88 PageID: 12 to set a\nstake in the ground for what features we think are 'good enough' for the\nconsumer. I would argue we're already doing *more* than what would have been\ngood enough. But we find it very hard to regress our product features YOY\n[year over year].\" Existing features \"would have been good enough today if we\nhadn't introduced [them] already,\" and \"anything new and especially expensive\nneeds to be rigorously challenged before it's allowed into the consumer\nphone.\" Thus, it is not surprising that Apple spent more than twice as much on\nstock buybacks and dividends as it did on research and development. 15.\nMoreover, Apple has demonstrated its ability to use its smartphone monopoly to\nimpose fee structures and manipulate app review to inhibit aggrieved parties\nfrom taking advantage of regulatory and judicial solutions imposed on Apple\nthat attempt to narrowly remedy harm from its conduct. Apple wraps itself in a\ncloak of privacy, security, and consumer preferences to justify its\nanticompetitive conduct. Indeed, it spends billions on marketing and branding\nto promote the self-serving premise that only Apple can safeguard consumers'\nprivacy and security interests. Apple selectively compromises privacy and\nsecurity interests when doing so is in Apple's own financial interest\u2014such as\ndegrading the security of text messages, offering governments and certain\ncompanies the chance to access more private and secure versions of app stores,\nor accepting billions of dollars each year for choosing Google as its default\nsearch engine when more private options are available. In the end, Apple\ndeploys privacy and security justifications as an elastic shield that can\nstretch or contract to serve Apple's financial and business interests. 16. 17.\nSmartphones have so revolutionized American life that it can be hard to\nimagine a world beyond the one that Apple, a self-interested monopolist, deems\n\"good enough.\u201d But under 12\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 13 of 88 PageID: 13 our\nsystem of antitrust laws, \"good enough\u201d is, quite simply, not enough.\nConsumers, competition, and the competitive process- -not Apple alone-should\ndecide what options consumers should have. And competition, not Apple's self-\ninterested business strategies, should be the catalyst for innovation\nessential to our daily lives, not only in the smartphone market but in closely\nrelated industries like personal entertainment, automotive infotainment, and\neven more innovations that have not yet been imagined. Competition is what\nwill ensure that Apple's conduct and business decisions do not thwart the next\nApple. 18. Protecting competition and the innovation that competition\ninevitably ushers in for consumers, developers, publishers, content creators,\nand device manufacturers is why Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit under Section 2\nof the Sherman Act to challenge Apple's maintenance of its monopoly over\nsmartphone markets, which affect hundreds of millions of Americans every day.\nPlaintiffs bring this case to rid smartphone markets of Apple's monopolization\nand exclusionary conduct and to ensure that the next generation of innovators\ncan upend the technological world as we know it with new and transformative\ntechnologies. 13\n\nI.

Apple is one of the world's most valuable public\ncompanies with a market capitalization over $2.5 trillion. In fiscal year\n2023, Apple generated annual net revenues of $383 billion and net income of\n$97 billion. Apple's net income exceeds any other company in the Fortune 500\nand the gross domestic products of more than 100 countries. The iPhone,\nApple's signature product, is the primary driver of Apple's growth and\nprofitability, routinely commanding profit margins of more than 30 percent on\ndevices alone\u2014significantly higher than its smartphone competitors. iPhone\nsales have made up a majority of Apple's annual revenue every year since 2012.\n21. Apple increasingly extracts revenue from iPhone users beyond the initial\nsmartphone sale. For example, Apple offers iPhone upgrades, apps and in-app\npayments, paid digital subscription services (e.g., Apple's music streaming,\nTV, news, gaming, fitness, and cloud storage subscriptions), accessories\n(e.g., tracking devices, headphones, chargers, iPhone cases), and more. Apple\nrefers to these offerings as \"Services\" and \"Wearables, Home, and\nAccessories,\" respectively. In fiscal year 2023, these offerings accounted for\nnearly one-third of Apple's total revenue, or four times what Apple earned\nfrom selling Mac computers. Some of the largest drivers of revenue within\nthese categories are Apple's smartwatch, the Apple Watch, and Apple's App\nStore, where iPhone users purchase and download apps. In recent years,\nServices have accounted for an increasing share of Apple's revenues, while the\niPhone has remained the primary gateway through which U.S. consumers access\nthese services. 22. Apple's U.S. market share by revenue is over 70 percent in\nthe performance smartphone market a more expensive segment of the broader\nsmartphone market where 19. 20. 16\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 17 of 88 PageID: 17 Apple's\nown executives recognize the company competes and over 65 percent for all\nsmartphones. These market shares have remained remarkably durable over the\nlast decade. 23. Apple's smartphone market shares understate Apple's dominance\nand likely growth in key demographics, including among younger American\nconsumers. For example, onethird of all iPhone users in the United States were\nborn after 1996, as compared to just 10 percent for Samsung, Apple's closest\nsmartphone competitor. Surveys show that as many as 88 percent of U.S.\nteenagers expect to purchase an iPhone for their next smartphone. iPhone users\nalso tend to come from higher income households. Because smartphone users\ngenerally use a single smartphone to access related products and services,\nlocking up key user groups allows Apple to capture greater spending on iPhone-\nrelated products and services, realize higher margins per user as compared to\nits smartphone rivals, and exercise greater control over developers and other\nsmartphone ecosystem participants. 24. In fiscal year 2023, Apple spent $30\nbillion on research and development. By comparison, Apple spent $77 billion on\nstock buybacks during the same year. 25. Apple was founded in 1976. During its\nfirst 25 years, the company focused in large part on producing and marketing\npersonal computers. Although the market for personal computers expanded over\nthe next several decades, Apple struggled to gain customer adoption for its\nhigher-priced products relative to its lower-cost competitors, including IBM\nand Microsoft. In the late 1990s, Apple significantly restructured the company\nand embarked on a new strategy focused not just on selling personal computers,\nbut also consumer devices like the iPod, which led to the development of the\niPhone. 17\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 18 of 88 PageID: 18 A. 26.\nApple launched the iPod, iTunes, and the iTunes Store against the backdrop of\nUnited States v. Microsoft When Apple began developing mobile consumer\ndevices, it did so against the backdrop of United States v. Microsoft, which\ncreated new opportunities for innovation in areas that would become critical\nto the success of Apple's consumer devices and the company itself. For\nexample, the iPod did not achieve widespread adoption until Apple developed a\ncrossplatform version of the iPod and iTunes for Microsoft's Windows operating\nsystem, at the time the dominant operating system for personal computers. In\nthe absence of the consent decree in United States v. Microsoft, it would have\nbeen more difficult for Apple to achieve this success and ultimately launch\nthe iPhone. 27. On May 18, 1998, the Justice Department and the attorneys\ngeneral of 19 states and the District of Columbia filed United States v.\nMicrosoft, an antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft alleging that the company\nhad violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act by monopolizing the market for\nIntel-compatible personal computer operating systems. At trial, the government\nsuccessfully established that Microsoft took steps to undermine the\ncompetitive threats posed by \"middleware,\" such as web browsers like Netscape,\nafter recognizing that if users could use middleware to access a variety of\ncontent and services via remote servers, over the internet, they might be less\nreliant on Windows. 28. Microsoft also took steps to undermine cross-platform\ntechnologies like QuickTime, a software architecture developed by Apple to\nplay multimedia content (e.g., music and videos) on Apple's Mac computers and\nMicrosoft's Windows PCs. In particular, Apple's then-Senior Vice President of\nSoftware Engineering testified that Microsoft \"[wrote] steps into its\noperating system to ensure that a QuickTime file will not operate reliably on\nWindows,\" \"trick[ed] the user into believing that QuickTime technology is part\nof the problem actually 18\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 19 of 88 PageID: 19 caused\nby the Windows operating system,\u201d and \u201cintroduced greater technical\nincompatibilities between QuickTime and Microsoft products.\" 29. In April\n2000, the trial court ultimately found that Microsoft's conduct violated\nSection 2 of the Sherman Act. An appeals court upheld the district court's\nfindings of liability regarding middleware. 30. In January 2001, Apple\nintroduced iTunes, software built on Apple's QuickTime architecture, and\nadvertised it as \"Jukebox Software\" for organizing and listening to music. The\ninitial version of iTunes was only compatible with Apple's Mac computers. 31.\nLater that same year, Apple debuted the iPod, a portable digital audio player\nthat worked alongside iTunes to \"let[] you put your entire music collection in\nyour pocket and listen to it wherever you go.\" Like iTunes, the initial iPod\nwas only compatible with Mac computers. 32. On November 1, 2002, the trial\ncourt accepted a proposed consent decree in United States v. Microsoft. Among\nother things, the consent decree prohibited Microsoft from retaliating against\ncompanies for developing or distributing products such as browsers and media\nplayers. The consent decree also required Microsoft to make various APIs\navailable to thirdparty developers, including Apple. 33. Following that\nconsent decree in October 2003, Apple launched a cross-platform version of\niTunes that was compatible with the Windows operating system. As a result, a\nmuch larger group of users could finally use the iPod and iTunes, including\nthe iTunes Store. The iTunes Store allowed users to buy and download music and\nplay it on their iTunes computer application or on the iPod. Apple benefited\nsubstantially from this new customer base. In the first two years after\nlaunching the iPod, Apple sold a few hundred thousand devices. The year after\nlaunching a Windows-compatible version of iTunes and gaining access to\nmillions more 19\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 20 of 88 PageID: 20\ncustomers, Apple sold millions of devices. Apple went on to sell hundreds of\nmillions of iPod devices over the next two decades. Moreover, iTunes became\nthe market leader in online music services. At an event in 2007, Apple's then-\nCEO said of the iPod, \u201cit didn't just change the way we all listened to music,\nit changed the entire music industry.\" At the same event, he announced that\nthe company would change its name from Apple Computer, Inc. to Apple, Inc. in\nlight of its shifting focus to consumer electronics rather than computers. 34.\nThe ubiquity of iPod and iTunes on Windows, in part because of a successful\nantitrust enforcement action against Microsoft, contributed to the development\nand success of Apple's next flagship product-the iPhone. But after launching\nthe iPhone, Apple began stifling the development of cross-platform\ntechnologies on the iPhone, just as Microsoft tried to stifle cross-platform\ntechnologies on Windows. In January 2007, Apple debuted the first-generation\niPhone, describing the device as \"an iPod, a phone, and an internet\ncommunicator,\" and touting the fact that users could \"sync[] content from a\nuser's iTunes library on their PC or Mac.\" Apple marketed the iPhone as a\nsmartphone that was easy to use. Reflecting on the company's learning from the\niPod, Apple's then-CEO announced, \u201ciTunes is going to sync all your media to\nyour iPhone\u2014but also a ton of data. Contacts, calendars, photos, notes,\nbookmarks, email accounts.\" 36. The original iPhone cost approximately\n$299-approximately $450 in 2024 dollars adjusted for inflation with a two-year\ncontract with a phone carrier. 37. At launch, nearly all native apps for the\niPhone were created by Apple. There were only about a dozen apps overall,\nincluding Calendar, Camera, Clock, Contacts, iPod, Messages, Notes, Phone,\nPhotos, Safari, Stocks, Voice Memos, and Weather. 35. 20\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 21 of 88 PageID: 21 38.\nWithin a year of launching the iPhone, Apple invited third-party developers to\ncreate native apps for the iPhone. Apple released its first software\ndevelopment kit essentially the digital tools for building native apps on\nApple's operating system (iOS) to encourage and enable third-party developers\nto create native apps for the iPhone. Apple also offered developers ways to\nearn money by selling apps and later in-app purchases and subscriptions. By\n2009, Apple was running marketing campaigns highlighting the value that third-\nparty apps provide to iPhone users with the trademarked slogan: \"There's an\napp for that.\u201d 39. Apple's decision to invite third-party participation on its\niPhone platform benefited Apple, too. The proliferation of third-party apps\ngenerated billions of dollars in profits for Apple and an iPhone user base of\nmore than 250 million devices in the United States. Apple's market shares-\n-over 70 percent of the performance smartphone market and over 65 percent of\nthe broader smartphone market\u2014likely understate its monopoly power today. 40.\nWhile Apple profits from third-party developers that increase the iPhone's\nvalue to users, Apple executives understand that third-party products and\nservices can, in their own words, be \"fundamentally disruptive\" to its\nsmartphone monopoly, decreasing users' dependence on Apple and the iPhone and\nincreasing competitive pressure on Apple. Apple therefore willingly sacrifices\nthe short-term benefits it would gain from improved products and services\ndeveloped by third parties when necessary to maintain its monopoly. Apple\ninvited third-party investment on the iPhone and then imposed tight controls\non app creation and app distribution Apple controls how developers distribute\nand create apps for iPhone users. For example, developers can only distribute\nnative iPhone apps through Apple's App Store, which is the only way for users\nto download native iOS apps. Limiting distribution to the Apple App Store\nenables Apple to exert monopoly power over developers by imposing contractual\nB. 41. 21\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 22 of 88 PageID: 22\nrestrictions and rules that limit the behavior of non-Apple apps and services.\nSpecifically, Apple sets the conditions for apps it allows on the Apple App\nStore through its App Store Review Guidelines. Under these guidelines, Apple\nhas sole discretion to review and approve all apps and app updates. Apple\nselectively exercises that discretion to its own benefit, deviating from or\nchanging its guidelines when it suits Apple's interests and allowing Apple\nexecutives to control app reviews and decide whether to approve individual\napps or updates. Apple often enforces its App Store rules arbitrarily. And it\nfrequently uses App Store rules and restrictions to penalize and restrict\ndevelopers that take advantage of technologies that threaten to disrupt,\ndisintermediate, compete with, or erode Apple's monopoly power. 42. Apple also\ncontrols app creation by deciding which APIs are available to developers when\nthey make third-party apps. For example, developers cannot provide native apps\non the iPhone unless they enter into Apple's non-negotiable Developer Program\nLicense Agreement (DPLA). That agreement requires developers to use public\nAPIs only \"in the manner prescribed by Apple.\" It also prohibits third-party\napps from using APIs that Apple designates as \"private.\" Apple selectively\ndesignates APIs as public or private to benefit Apple, limiting the\nfunctionality developers can offer to iPhone users even when the same\nfunctionality is available in Apple's own apps, or even select third-party\napps. Similar to Apple's App Store restrictions, Apple uses its DPLA to impose\nrestrictions that penalize and restrict developers that take advantage of\ntechnologies that threaten to disrupt, disintermediate, compete with, or erode\nApple's monopoly power. 43. Developers cannot avoid Apple's control of app\ndistribution and app creation by making web apps\u2014apps created using standard\nprogramming languages for web-based content and available over the internet-as\nan alternative to native apps. Many iPhone users do not look 22\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 23 of 88 PageID: 23 for or\nknow how to find web apps, causing web apps to constitute only a small\nfraction of app usage. Apple recognizes that web apps are not a good\nalternative to native apps for developers. As one Apple executive\nacknowledged, \u201c[d]evelopers can't make much money on the web.\" Regardless,\nApple can still control the functionality of web apps because Apple requires\nall web browsers on the iPhone to use WebKit, Apple's browser engine the key\nsoftware components that third-party browsers use to display web content. 44.\nNor can developers rely on alternative app stores even though this would\nbenefit developers and users. For example, developers cannot offer iPhone\nusers an app store that only offers apps curated for use by children, which\nwould provide opportunities to improve privacy, security, and child safety. By\ncontrast, Apple allows certain enterprise and public sector customers to offer\nversions of app stores with more curated apps to better protect privacy and\nsecurity. 45. Apple's control over both app distribution and app creation\ngives Apple tremendous power. For example, Apple designates as \"private\" the\nAPIs needed to send Short Message Service, or SMS, text messages, which is a\nprotocol used by mobile carriers since the early 1990s to allow users to send\nbasic text messages to other mobile phone numbers using their own mobile phone\nnumbers. Developers have no technical means to access these private APIs, but\neven if they did, doing so would breach their developer agreement with Apple,\nand therefore put the developer at risk of losing the ability to distribute\napps through the App Store. For example, Apple prohibits third-party iPhone\napps from sending or receiving SMS text messages even though this\nfunctionality is available through Apple Messages. Likewise, Apple can control\nthe functionality of third-party apps and accessories through its control of\napp distribution 23\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 24 of 88 PageID: 24 because\nif an app includes functionality that Apple does not like, Apple can and does\nexercise its discretion to simply block the app from the App Store. 46.\nApple's dominance is such that neither app developers nor iPhone users can\nbenefit from lower cost or higher quality means of distributing apps or\npurchasing and providing digital products and services. Instead, Apple\nguarantees that it continues to benefit from the contributions of third-party\ndevelopers and other platform participants while also protecting itself from\nthe competitive threats and pressure those participants pose to Apple's\nsmartphone monopoly. 47. This complaint focuses on Apple's use of its\ndominance to impose contracts and rules that restrict the behavior and design\ndecisions of companies other than Apple. III. Smartphones Are Platforms 48.\nSmartphones combine the functionality of a traditional mobile phone with\nadvanced hardware and software components. This cluster of services and\nfeatures results in a distinct product for consumers and developers. For\nexample, smartphones not only make phone calls, but also allow users to listen\nto music, send text messages, take pictures, play games, access software for\nwork, manage their finances, and browse the internet. Smartphones are\nplatforms. Platforms bring together different groups that benefit from each\nother's participation on the platform. A food delivery app, for example, is a\nmultisided platform that brings together restaurants, couriers, and consumers.\nA two-sided platform, for example, may bring together service providers on the\none hand and consumers on the other. The technology and economics of a\nsmartphone platform are fundamentally different from the technology and\neconomics of a simultaneous transaction platform, such as a credit card,\nbecause smartphone platforms compete over device features and pricing in ways\nthat do not directly relate to app store transactions. Whereas credit card\ntransactions reflect a single simultaneous 24 49.\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 25 of 88 PageID: 25 action\nthat requires both sides of the transaction for either side to exist,\nconsumers value smartphone platforms for a variety of reasons separate from\ntheir ability to facilitate a simultaneous transaction. Consumers care about\nnon-transactional components of the phone, such as its camera and processing\nspeed, and they care about non-transactional components of apps, such as their\nfeatures and functionality. 50. The economics of a smartphone platform are\nsuch that the platform's value to users and in turn to the platform operator-\nincrease when new apps and new features are added to the platform. In order to\ncreate these economic benefits for itself and its users, Apple has opened its\nsmartphone platform to third-party developers, whose countless inventions and\ninnovations have created enormous value. Apple has willingly opened the\nplatform to third-party developers to capture this value even though there is\nno extensive regulatory framework requiring it to do so or overseeing how it\ninteracts with those third parties. In this way, smartphone platforms are very\ndifferent from other platforms, like landline telephone networks, whose value-\nadding features were built primarily by the platform operator and which were\nonly opened to third parties when the platform operator was required to do so\nby regulation. When a third-party developer for the iPhone creates a valuable\nnew feature, consumers benefit and consumer demand goes up for Apple's\nproducts, increasing the economic value of the iPhone to Apple. This has\nplayed out hundreds of thousands of times for the iPhone, resulting in an\nenormously valuable smartphone platform reflecting the combined contributions\nof millions of developers. In contrast, limiting the features and\nfunctionality created by third-party developers and therefore available to\niPhone users makes the iPhone worse and deprives Apple of the economic value\nit would gain as the platform operator. It makes no economic sense 51. 25\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 26 of 88 PageID: 26 for\nApple to sacrifice the profits it would earn from new features and\nfunctionality unless it has some other compensating reason to do so, such as\nprotecting its monopoly profits. IV. Apple Unlawfully Maintains Its Monopoly\nPower Apple harms competition by imposing contractual restrictions, fees, and\ntaxes on app creation and distribution Apple's internal documents show that,\nsoon after the iPhone's introduction and notwithstanding its success, the\ncompany began to fear that disintermediation of its platform and the\ncommoditization of the iPhone would threaten Apple's substantial profits from\niPhone sales and related revenue streams. A. 52. 53. Accordingly, Apple\nexercised its control of app creation and app distribution in key cases to\ncement the iPhone and App Store as the primary gateway to apps, products, and\nservices. Apple often claims these rules and restrictions are necessary to\nprotect user privacy or security, but Apple's documents tell a different\nstory. In reality, Apple imposes certain restrictions to benefit its bottom\nline by thwarting direct and disruptive competition for its iPhone platform\nfees and/or for the importance of the iPhone platform itself. 54. Three\naspects of Apple's efforts to protect and exploit its smartphone monopoly are\nworth noting. First, Apple exercises its control over app distribution and app\ncreation to dictate how developers innovate for the iPhone, enforcing rules\nand contractual restrictions that stop or delay developers from innovating in\nways that threaten Apple's power. In so doing, Apple influences the direction\nof innovation both on and off the iPhone. 55. Second, Apple drives iPhone\nusers away from products and services that compete with or threaten Apple. In\ndoing so, Apple increases the cost and friction of switching from the iPhone\nto another smartphone and generates extraordinary profits through subscription\nservices 26\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 27 of 88 PageID: 27 (like\nApple's proprietary music, gaming, cloud storage, and news services),\nadvertisements within the App Store, and accessories like headphones and\nsmartwatches. 56. Third, Apple uses these restrictions to extract monopoly\nrents from third parties in a variety of ways, including app fees and revenue-\nshare requirements. For most of the last 15 years, Apple collected a tax in\nthe form of a 30 percent commission on the price of any app downloaded from\nthe App Store, a 30 percent tax on in-app purchases, and fees to access the\ntools needed to develop iPhone native apps in the first place. While Apple has\nreduced the tax it collects from a subset of developers, Apple still extracts\n30 percent from many app makers. Apple also generates substantial and\nincreasing revenue by charging developers to help users find their apps in the\nApp Store-something that, for years, Apple told developers was part of the\nreason they paid a 30 percent tax in the first place. For example, Apple will\nsell keyword searches for an app to someone other than the owner of the app.\nApple is able to command these rents from companies of all sizes, including\nsome of the largest and most sophisticated companies in the world. 57. As\nApple exercised its control of app distribution and app creation, Apple slowed\nits own iPhone innovation and extracted more revenue and profit from its\nexisting customers through subscriptions, advertising, and cloud services.\nThese services increase the cost of switching from the iPhone to another\nsmartphone because many of these services including its proprietary gaming,\ncloud storage, and news service\u2014are exclusive to the Apple ecosystem, causing\nsignificant frictions for iPhone users who try to use alternative services on\nanother smartphone. Moreover, Apple's conduct demonstrates that Apple\nrecognized the importance of digital products and services for the success of\nthe iPhone while at the same time it restricted the 27\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 28 of 88 PageID: 28\ndevelopment and growth of non-iPhone products and services especially those\nthat might make it easier for users to switch from the iPhone to another\nsmartphone. 58. Each step in Apple's course of conduct built and reinforced\nthe moat around its smartphone monopoly. The cumulative effect of this course\nof conduct has been to maintain and entrench Apple's smartphone monopoly at\nthe expense of the users, developers, and other third parties who helped make\nthe iPhone what it is today. Despite major technological changes over the\nyears, Apple's power to control app creation and distribution and extract fees\nfrom developers has remained largely the same, unconstrained by competitive\npressures or market forces. That this conduct is impervious to competition\nreflects the success of Apple's efforts to create and maintain its smartphone\nmonopoly, the strength of that monopoly, and the durability of Apple's power.\n59. Apple's monopoly maintenance has taken many forms and continues to evolve\ntoday; however, Apple's anticompetitive and exclusionary course of conduct is\nexemplified by its contractual rules and restrictions targeting several\nproducts and services: super apps, cloud streaming apps, messaging apps,\nsmartwatches, and digital wallets. By stifling these technologies, and many\nothers, Apple reinforces the moat around its smartphone monopoly not by making\nits products more attractive to users, but by discouraging innovation that\nthreatens Apple's smartphone monopoly or the disintermediation of the iPhone.\nApple continues to expand and shift the scope and categories of\nanticompetitive conduct such that the cumulative anticompetitive effect of\nApple's conduct is even more powerful than that of each exclusionary act\nstanding alone. 28\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 29 of 88 PageID: 29 Super\nApps: Apple prevented apps from threatening its smartphone monopoly by\nundermining mini programs that reduce user dependence on the iPhone 60. For\nyears, Apple denied its users access to super apps because it viewed them as\n\"fundamentally disruptive\" to \"existing app distribution and development\nparadigms\" and ultimately Apple's monopoly power. Apple feared super apps\nbecause it recognized that as they become popular, \u201cdemand for iPhone is\nreduced.\" So, Apple used its control over app distribution and app creation to\neffectively prohibit developers from offering super apps instead of competing\non the merits. 61. A super app is an app that can serve as a platform for\nsmaller \u201cmini\u201d programs developed using programming languages such as HTML5\nand JavaScript. By using programming languages standard in most web pages,\nmini programs are cross platform, meaning they work the same on any web\nbrowser and on any device. Developers can therefore write a single mini\nprogram that works whether users have an iPhone or another smartphone. 62.\nSuper apps can provide significant benefits to users. For example, a super app\nthat incorporates a multitude of mini programs might allow users to easily\ndiscover and access a wide variety of content and services without setting up\nand logging into multiple apps, not unlike how Netflix and Hulu allow users to\nfind and watch thousands of movies and television shows in a i. single app. As\none Apple executive put it, \"who doesn't want faster, easier to discover apps\nthat do everything a full app does?\" Restricting super apps makes users worse\noff and sacrifices the short-term profitability of iPhones for Apple. Super\napps also reduce user dependence on the iPhone, including the iOS operating\nsystem and Apple's App Store. This is because a super app is a kind of\nmiddleware 63. 29\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 30 of 88 PageID: 30 that can\nhost apps, services, and experiences without requiring developers to use the\niPhone's APIs or code. 64. As users interact with a super app, they rely less\non the smartphone's proprietary software and more on the app itself.\nEventually, users become more willing to choose a different smartphone because\nthey can access the same interface, apps, and content they desire on any\nsmartphone where the super app is also present. Moreover, developers can write\nmini programs that run on the super app without having to write separate apps\nfor iPhones and other smartphones. This lowers barriers to entry for\nsmartphone rivals, decreases Apple's control over third-party developers, and\nreduces switching costs. 65. Apple recognizes that super apps with mini\nprograms would threaten its monopoly. As one Apple manager put it, allowing\nsuper apps to become \"the main gateway where people play games, book a car,\nmake payments, etc.\" would \"let the barbarians in at the gate.\" Why? Because\nwhen a super app offers popular mini programs, \"iOS stickiness goes down.\" 66.\nApple's fear of super apps is based on first-hand experience with enormously\npopular super apps in Asia. Apple does not want U.S. companies and U.S. users\nto benefit from similar innovations. For example, in a Board of Directors\npresentation, Apple highlighted the \"[u]ndifferentiated user experience on [a]\nsuper platform\u201d as a \u201cmajor headwind\" to growing iPhone sales in countries\nwith popular super apps due to the \"[1]ow stickiness\" and \"[1]ow switching\ncost.\" For the same reasons, a super app created by a U.S. company would pose\na similar threat to Apple's smartphone dominance in the United States. Apple\nnoted as a risk in 2017 that a potential super app created by a specific U.S.\ncompany would \u201creplace[ ] usage of native OS and apps resulting in\ncommoditization of smartphone hardware.\" 30\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 31 of 88 PageID: 31 67.\nApple did not respond to the risk that super apps might disrupt its monopoly\nby innovating. Instead, Apple exerted its control over app distribution to\nstifle others' innovation. Apple created, strategically broadened, and\naggressively enforced its App Store Guidelines to effectively block apps from\nhosting mini programs. Apple's conduct disincentivized investments in mini\nprogram development and caused U.S. companies to abandon or limit support for\nthe technology in the United States. 68. In particular, part of what makes\nsuper apps valuable to consumers is that finding and using mini programs is\neasier than using an app store and navigating many separate apps, passwords,\nand set-up processes. Instead of making mini program discovery easy for users,\nhowever, Apple made it nearly impossible. 69. Since at least 2017, Apple has\narbitrarily imposed exclusionary requirements that unnecessarily and\nunjustifiably restrict mini programs and super apps. For example, Apple\nrequired apps in the United States to display mini programs using a flat,\ntext-only list of mini programs. Apple also banned displaying mini programs\nwith icons or tiles, such as descriptive pictures of the content or service\noffered by the mini program. Apple also banned apps from categorizing mini\nprograms, such as by displaying recently played games or more games by the\nsame developer. These restrictions throttle the popularity of mini programs\nand ultimately make the iPhone worse because it discourages developers from\ncreating apps and other content that would be attractive to iPhone users. 70.\nApple also selectively enforced its contractual rules with developers to\nprevent developers from monetizing mini programs, hurting both users and\ndevelopers. For example, Apple blocked mini programs from accessing the APIs\nneeded to implement Apple's in-app payment (IAP) system even if developers\nwere willing to pay Apple's monopoly tax. Similarly, 31\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 32 of 88 PageID: 32 Apple\nblocked developers' ability to use in-app payment methods other than directly\nusing IAP. For instance, super apps could create a virtual currency for\nconsumers to use in mini programs, but Apple blocked this too. Apple, however,\nallows other, less-threatening apps to do so. ii. Cloud Streaming Apps: Apple\nprevented developers from offering cloud gaming apps that reduce dependence on\nthe iPhone's expensive hardware 71. For years, Apple blocked cloud gaming apps\nthat would have given users access to desirable apps and content without\nneeding to pay for expensive Apple hardware because this would threaten its\nmonopoly power. In Apple's own words, it feared a world where \"all that\nmatters is who has the cheapest hardware\" and consumers could \"buy[] a\n[expletive] Android for 25 bux at a garage sale and . . . have a solid cloud\ncomputing device\" that \"works fine.\" Apple's conduct made its own product\nworse because consumers missed out on apps and content. This conduct also cost\nApple substantial revenues from third-party developers. At the same time,\nApple also made other smartphones worse by stifling the growth of these cross-\nplatform apps on other smartphones. Importantly, Apple prevented the emergence\nof technologies that could lower the price that consumers pay for iPhones. 72.\nCloud streaming apps let users run a computationally intensive program without\nhaving to process or store the program on the smartphone itself. Instead, a\nuser's smartphone leverages the computing power of a remote server, which runs\nthe program and streams the result back to the phone. Cloud streaming allows\ndevelopers to bring cutting-edge technologies and services to smartphone\nconsumers\u2014including gaming and interactive artificial intelligence services\neven if their smartphone includes hardware that is less powerful than an\niPhone. 73. Cloud streaming has significant benefits for users. For example,\nApple has promoted the iPhone 15 by promising that its hardware is powerful\nenough to enable \u201cnext-level 32\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 33 of 88 PageID: 33\nperformance and mobile gaming.\" But powerful hardware is unnecessary if games\nare played via cloud streaming apps. For a cloud game, the user experiences\nand plays the game on the smartphone, but the game is run by hardware and\nsoftware in remote computing centers (\u201cthe cloud\"). Thus, cloud gaming apps\ndeliver rich gaming experiences on smartphones without the need for users to\npurchase powerful, expensive hardware. As a result, users with access to cloud\nstreamed games may be more willing to switch from an iPhone to a smartphone\nwith less expensive hardware because both smartphones can run desirable games\nequally well. 74. Cloud streaming also has significant advantages for\ndevelopers. For example, instead of re-writing the same game for multiple\noperating systems, cloud platforms can act as middleware that allow developers\nto create a single app that works across iOS, Android, and other operating\nsystems. Cloud streaming provides more and simpler options for offering\nsubscriptions, collecting payments, and distributing software updates as well.\nAll of this helps game developers reach economies of scale and profitability\nthey might not achieve without offering cloud gaming apps and reduces their\ndependence on iOS and Apple's App Store. 75. Apple wielded its power over app\ndistribution to effectively prevent third-party developers from offering cloud\ngaming subscription services as a native app on the iPhone. Even today, none\nare currently available on the iPhone. 76. For years, Apple imposed the\nonerous requirement that any cloud streaming game or any update to a cloud\nstreaming game be submitted as a stand-alone app for approval by Apple. Having\nto submit individual cloud streaming games for review by Apple increased the\ncost of releasing games on the iPhone and limited the number of games a\ndeveloper could make available to iPhone users. For example, the highest\nquality games, referred to as AAA games, typically require daily or even\nhourly updates across different platforms. If these 33\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 34 of 88 PageID: 34 updates\nneed to be individually approved by Apple, developers must either delay their\nsoftware updates across all platforms or only update their games on non-iOS\nplatforms, potentially making the iOS version of the game incompatible with\nother versions on other platforms until Apple approves the update. Neither\noption is tenable for players or developers. 77. Until recently, Apple would\nhave required users to download cloud streaming software separately for each\nindividual game, install identical app updates for each game individually, and\nmake repeated trips to Apple's App Store to find and download games. Apple's\nconduct made cloud streaming apps so unattractive to users that no developer\ndesigned one for the iPhone. 78. Apple undermines cloud gaming apps in other\nways too, such as by requiring cloud games to use Apple's proprietary payment\nsystem and necessitating game overhauls and payment redesigns specifically for\nthe iPhone. Apple's rules and restrictions effectively force developers to\ncreate a separate iOS-specific version of their app instead of creating a\nsingle cloud-based version that is compatible with several operating systems,\nincluding iOS. As a result, developers expend considerable time and resources\nre-engineering apps to bring crossplatform apps like multiplayer games to the\niPhone. 79. Cloud streaming apps broadly speaking\u2014not just gaming\u2014could force\nApple to compete more vigorously against rivals. As one Apple manager\nrecognized, cloud streaming eliminates \"a big reason for high-performance\nlocal compute\" and thus eliminates one of the iPhone's advantages over other\nsmartphones because then \u201call that matters is who has the cheapest hardware.\"\nAccordingly, it reduces the need for users to buy expensive phones with\nadvanced hardware. This problem does not \"stop at high-end gaming,\u201d but\napplies to \u201ca number of high-compute requirement applications.\" 34\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 35 of 88 PageID: 35 B. Apple\nuses APIs and other critical access points in the smartphone ecosystem to\ncontrol the behavior and innovation of third parties in order to insulate\nitself from competition 81. i. Messaging: Apple protects its smartphone\nmonopoly by degrading and undermining cross-platform messaging apps and rival\nsmartphones 80. Apple undermines cross-platform messaging to reinforce\n\"obstacle[s] to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones.\" Apple could\nhave made a better cross-platform messaging experience itself by creating\niMessage for Android but concluded that doing so \"will hurt us more than help\nus.\" Apple therefore continues to impede innovation in smartphone messaging,\neven though doing so sacrifices the profits Apple would earn from increasing\nthe value of the iPhone to users, because it helps build and maintain its\nmonopoly power. Messaging apps allow smartphone users to communicate with\nfriends, family, and other contacts and are often the primary way users\ninteract with their smartphones. In Apple's own words, messaging apps are \u201ca\ncentral artery through which the full range of customer experience flows.\" 82.\nSmartphone messaging apps operate using \"protocols,\" which are the systems\nthat enable communication and determine the features available when users\ninteract with each other via messaging apps. 83. One important protocol used\nby messaging apps is SMS.1 SMS offers a broad user network, but limited\nfunctionality. For example, all mobile phones can receive SMS messages, but\nSMS does not support modern messaging features, such as large files, edited\nmessages, or reactions like a \"thumbs up\" or a heart. 1 Following industry\npractice, throughout this complaint, \"SMS\" refers to both SMS and MMS\n(\"multimedia messaging service\"). MMS is a companion protocol to SMS that\nallows for group messages and messages with basic multimedia content, such as\nsmall file sharing. 35\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 36 of 88 PageID: 36 84. Many\nmessaging apps such as WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Signaluse\nproprietary, internet-based protocols, which are sometimes referred to as OTT\n(\"over the top\") protocols. OTT messaging typically involves more secure and\nadvanced features, such as encryption, typing indicators, read receipts, the\nability to share rich media, and disappearing or ephemeral messages. While all\nmobile phones can send and receive SMS messages, OTT only works between users\nwho sign up for and communicate through the same messaging app. As a result, a\nuser cannot send an OTT message to a friend unless the friend also uses the\nsame messaging app. 85. Apple makes third-party messaging apps on the iPhone\nworse generally and relative to Apple Messages, Apple's own messaging app. By\ndoing so, Apple is knowingly and deliberately degrading quality, privacy, and\nsecurity for its users. For example, Apple designates the APIs needed to\nimplement SMS as \"private,\" meaning third-party developers have no technical\nmeans of accessing them and are prohibited from doing so under Apple's\ncontractual agreements with developers. As a result, third-party messaging\napps cannot combine the \"text to anyone\" functionality of SMS with the\nadvanced features of OTT messaging. Instead, if a user wants to send somebody\na message in a third-party messaging app, they must first confirm whether the\nperson they want to talk to has the same messaging app and, if not, convince\nthat person to download and use a new messaging app. By contrast, if an Apple\nMessages user wants to send somebody a message, they just type their phone\nnumber into the \"To:\" field and send the message because Apple Messages\nincorporates SMS and OTT messaging. 86. Apple prohibits third-party developers\nfrom incorporating other important features into their messaging apps as well.\nFor example, third-party messaging apps cannot continue operating in the\nbackground when the app is closed, which impairs functionality like 36\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 37 of 88 PageID: 37 message\ndelivery confirmation. And when users receive video calls, third-party\nmessaging apps cannot access the iPhone camera to allow users to preview their\nappearance on video before answering a call. Apple Messages incorporates these\nfeatures. 87. If third-party messaging apps could incorporate these features,\nthey would be more valuable and attractive to users, and the iPhone would be\nmore valuable to Apple in the short term. For example, by incorporating SMS,\nusers would avoid the hassle of convincing someone to download a separate app\nbefore sending them a message. Third-party messaging apps could also offer the\nability to schedule SMS messages to be sent in the future, suggest replies,\nand support robust multi-device use on smartphones, tablets, and computers as\nthey have already done on Android. 88. Moreover, messaging apps benefit from\nsignificant network effects as more people use the app, there are more people\nto communicate with through the app, which makes the app more valuable and in\nturn attracts even more users. Incorporating SMS would help thirdparty\nmessaging apps grow their network and attract more users. Instead, Apple\nlimits the reach of third-party messaging apps and reinforces network effects\nthat benefit Apple. Recently, Apple has stated that it plans to incorporate\nmore advanced features for cross-platform messaging in Apple Messages by\nadopting a 2019 version of the RCS protocol (which combines aspects of SMS and\nOTT). Apple has not done so yet, and regardless it would not cure Apple's\nefforts to undermine third-party messaging apps because third-party messaging\napps will still be prohibited from incorporating RCS just as they are\nprohibited from incorporating SMS. Moreover, the RCS standard will continue to\nimprove over time, and if Apple does not support later versions of RCS, cross-\nplatform messaging using RCS could soon be broken on iPhones anyway. 89. 37\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 38 of 88 PageID: 38 90. In\naddition to degrading the quality of third-party messaging apps, Apple\naffirmatively undermines the quality of rival smartphones. For example, if an\niPhone user messages a non-iPhone user in Apple Messages the default messaging\napp on an iPhone-then the text appears to the iPhone user as a green bubble\nand incorporates limited functionality: the conversation is not encrypted,\nvideos are pixelated and grainy, and users cannot edit messages or see typing\nindicators. This signals to users that rival smartphones are lower quality\nbecause the experience of messaging friends and family who do not own iPhones\nis worse- even though Apple, not the rival smartphone, is the cause of that\ndegraded user experience. Many non-iPhone users also experience social stigma,\nexclusion, and blame for \u201cbreaking\" chats where other participants own\niPhones. This effect is particularly powerful for certain demographics, like\nteenagers where the iPhone's share is 85 percent, according to one survey.\nThis social pressure reinforces switching costs and drives users to continue\nbuying iPhones\u2014solidifying Apple's smartphone dominance not because Apple has\nmade its smartphone better, but because it has made communicating with other\nsmartphones worse. Apple recognizes that its conduct harms users and makes it\nmore difficult to switch smartphones. For example, in 2013, Apple's Senior\nVice President of Software Engineering explained that supporting cross-\nplatform OTT messaging in Apple Messages \"would simply serve to remove [an]\nobstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones.\" In March 2016,\nApple's Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing forwarded an email to CEO\nTim Cook making the same point: \"moving iMessage to Android will hurt us more\nthan help us.\" 91. 38\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 39 of 88 PageID: 39 92. In\n2022, Apple's CEO Tim Cook was asked whether Apple would fix iPhone-toAndroid\nmessaging. \u201cIt's tough,\u201d the questioner implored Mr. Cook, \u201cnot to make it\npersonal but I can't send my mom certain videos.\" Mr. Cook's response? \u201cBuy\nyour mom an iPhone.\" 93. Recently, Apple blocked a third-party developer from\nfixing the broken crossplatform messaging experience in Apple Messages and\nproviding end-to-end encryption for messages between Apple Messages and\nAndroid users. By rejecting solutions that would allow for cross-platform\nencryption, Apple continues to make iPhone users' less secure than they could\notherwise be. ii. Smartwatches: Apple protects its smartphone monopoly by\nimpeding the development of cross-platform smartwatches 94. Apple uses\nsmartwatches, a costly accessory, to prevent iPhone customers from choosing\nother phones. Having copied the idea of a smartwatch from third-party\ndevelopers, Apple now prevents those developers from innovating and limits the\nApple Watch to the iPhone to prevent a negative \"impact to iPhone sales.\" 95.\nSmartwatches are wrist-worn devices with an interactive display and\naccompanying apps that let users perform a variety of functions, including\nmonitoring health data, responding to messages and notifications, performing\nmobile payments, and, of course, telling time. Smartwatches must generally be\npaired with a smartphone to operate and unlock their full functionality, such\nas receiving and responding to emails and text messages or answering phone\ncalls. Because of the nific cost of buying a smartwatch, users are less\nwilling to choose a smartphone if it is not compatible with their smartwatch.\n96. Apple's smartwatch Apple Watch is only compatible with the iPhone. So, if\nApple can steer a user towards buying an Apple Watch, it becomes more costly\nfor that 39\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 40 of 88 PageID: 40 user to\npurchase a different kind of smartphone because doing so requires the user to\nabandon their costly Apple Watch and purchase a new, Android-compatible\nsmartwatch. 97. By contrast, cross-platform smartwatches can reduce iPhone\nusers' dependence on Apple's proprietary hardware and software. If a user\npurchases a third-party smartwatch that is compatible with the iPhone and\nother smartphones, they can switch from the iPhone to another smartphone (or\nvice versa) by simply downloading the companion app on their new phone and\nconnecting to their smartwatch via Bluetooth. Moreover, as users interact with\na smartwatch, e.g., by accessing apps from their smartwatch instead of their\nsmartphone, users rely less on a smartphone's proprietary software and more on\nthe smartwatch itself. This also makes it easier for users to switch from an\niPhone to a different smartphone. 98. Apple recognizes that driving users to\npurchase an Apple Watch, rather than a third-party cross-platform smartwatch,\nhelps drive iPhone sales and reinforce the moat around its smartphone\nmonopoly. For example, in a 2019 email the Vice President of Product Marketing\nfor Apple Watch acknowledged that Apple Watch \"may help prevent iPhone\ncustomers from switching.\" Surveys have reached similar conclusions: many\nusers say the other devices linked to their iPhone are the reason they do not\nswitch to Android. 99. Apple also recognizes that making Apple Watch\ncompatible with Android would \"remove[an] iPhone differentiator.\" 100. Apple\nuses its control of the iPhone, including its technical and contractual\ncontrol of critical APIs, to degrade the functionality of third-party cross-\nplatform smartwatches in at least three significant ways: First, Apple\ndeprives iPhone users with third-party smartwatches of the ability to respond\nto notifications. Second, Apple inhibits third-party smartwatches from\nmaintaining a reliable connection with the iPhone. And third, Apple 40\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 41 of 88 PageID: 41\nundermines the performance of third-party smartwatches that connect directly\nwith a cellular network. In doing so, Apple constrains user choice and crushes\ninnovation that might help fill in the moat around Apple's smartphone\nmonopoly. 101. The ability to respond to notifications, e.g., new messages or\napp alerts, directly from a smartwatch is one of the top considerations for\nsmartwatch purchasers and one of the most used product features when it is\navailable. According to Apple's own market research, the ability to \"[s]end\nand receive text messages from social and messaging apps\" is a critical\nfeature for a smartwatch. In 2013, when Apple started offering users the\nability to connect their iPhones with third-party smartwatches, Apple provided\nthird-party smartwatch developers with access to various APIs related to the\nApple Notification Center Service, Calendar, Contacts, and Geolocation. The\nfollowing year, Apple introduced the Apple Watch and began limiting thirdparty\naccess to new and improved APIs for smartwatch functionality. For example,\nApple prevents third-party smartwatches from accessing APIs related to more\nadvanced Actionable Notifications, so iPhone users cannot respond to\nnotifications using a third-party smartwatch. Instead, Apple provides third-\nparty smartwatches access to more limited APIs that do not allow users to\nrespond to a message, accept a calendar invite, or take other actions\navailable on Apple Watch. 102. A reliable Bluetooth connection is essential\nfor a smartwatch to connect wirelessly with a smartphone, and thereby function\nas a companion to the user's smartphone and unlock its full functionality. But\nApple prohibits third-party smartwatch developers from maintaining a\nconnection even if a user accidentally turns off Bluetooth in the iPhone's\ncontrol center. Apple gives its own Apple Watch that functionality, however,\nbecause Apple recognizes that users frequently disable Bluetooth on their\niPhone without realizing that doing so 41\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 42 of 88 PageID: 42\ndisconnects their watch. As a result, iPhone users have a worse experience\nwhen they try to use a third-party smartwatch with their iPhone. Apple also\nrequires users to turn on \"Background App Refresh\" and disable the battery-\nsaving \"Low Power Mode\" in their iPhone settings for thirdparty smartwatches\nto remain consistently connected to their companion app, which is necessary to\nallow a user's iPhone and their smartwatch to update and share data about the\nweather or exercise tracking, even though Apple does not impose similar\nrequirements for Apple Watch. 103. Cellular-enabled smartwatches incorporate\nthe ability to connect directly to a cellular network, allowing users to make\ncalls, send messages, and download data even if their smartwatch is not paired\nto a smartphone. Cellular-enabled smartwatches are popular with consumers,\nmaking up approximately 20 percent of Apple Watch sales. Apple Watch users can\nuse the same phone number for their smartphone and smartwatch when connected\nto the cellular network. As a result, messages are delivered to both the\nuser's smartphone and smartwatch, providing an integrated messaging\nexperience. Although it is technologically feasible for Apple to allow an\niPhone user with a third-party smartwatch to do the same, Apple instead\nrequires these users to disable Apple's iMessage service on the iPhone in\norder to use the same phone number for both devices. This is a non-starter for\nmost iPhone users. In practice, iPhone users with a third-party smartwatch\nmust maintain separate phone numbers for the two devices, worsening their user\nexperience, and may miss out on receiving messages sent to their primary\niPhone number. Digital Wallets: Apple restricts cross-platform digital wallets\non the iPhone, reinforcing barriers to consumers switching to rival\nsmartphones 104. Apple recognizes that paying for products and services with a\ndigital wallet will eventually become \"something people do every day of their\nlives.\" But Apple has used its iii. 42\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 43 of 88 PageID: 43 control\nover app creation, including its technical and contractual control over API\naccess, to effectively block third-party developers from creating digital\nwallets on the iPhone with tap-topay functionality, which is an important\nfeature of a digital wallet for smartphones. As a result, Apple maintains\ncomplete control over how users make tap-to-pay payments with their iPhone.\nApple also deprives users of the benefits and innovations third-party wallets\nwould provide so that it can protect \"Apple's most important and successful\nbusiness, iPhone.\" 105. Digital wallets are apps that allow a user to store\nand use passes and credentials, including credit cards, personal\nidentification, movie tickets, and car keys, in a single app. For example,\ndigital wallets allow users to make in-person payments by tapping their device\non a payment terminal rather than tapping or swiping a physical credit card.\nDigital wallets can also be used for transactions in mobile apps and mobile\nwebsites. 106. Absent Apple's conduct, cross-platform digital wallets could\nalso be used to manage and pay for subscriptions and in-app purchases. 107.\nApple Wallet is Apple's proprietary digital wallet on the iPhone. Apple Wallet\nincorporates Apple's proprietary payment system Apple Pay, which processes\ndigital payments on the web, in apps, and at merchant points of sale. 108.\nToday, Apple Wallet offers users a way to make these payments using their\niPhone. But Apple envisions that Apple Wallet will ultimately supplant\nmultiple functions of physical wallets to become a single app for shopping,\ndigital keys, transit, identification, travel, entertainment, and more. As\nusers rely on Apple Wallet for payments and beyond, it \"drive[s] more sales of\niPhone and increase[s] stickiness to the Apple ecosystem\u201d because Apple Wallet\nis only available on the iPhone. Thus, switching to a different smartphone\nrequires leaving behind 43\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 44 of 88 PageID: 44 the\nfamiliarity of an everyday app, setting up a new digital wallet, and\npotentially losing access to certain credentials and personal data stored in\nApple Wallet. 109. Cross-platform digital wallets would offer an easier, more\nseamless, and potentially more secure way for users to switch from the iPhone\nto another smartphone. For example, if third-party developers could create\ncross-platform wallets, users transitioning away from the iPhone could\ncontinue to use the same wallet, with the same cards, IDs, payment histories,\npeer-to-peer payment contacts, and other information, making it easier to\nswitch smartphones. And because many users already use apps created by their\npreferred financial institutions, if these financial institutions offered\ndigital wallets, then users would have access to new apps and technologies\nwithout needing to share their private financial data with additional third\nparties, including Apple. In the short term, these improved features would\nmake the iPhone more attractive to users and profitable for Apple. 110.\nAccordingly, the absence of cross-platform digital wallets with tap-to-pay\ncapability on the iPhone makes it harder for iPhone users to purchase a\ndifferent smartphone. 111. The most important function for attracting users to\na digital wallet for smartphones is the ability to offer tap-to-pay, i.e., the\nability to make in-person payments by tapping your smartphone on a payment\nterminal. Apple uses its control over app creation and API access to\nselectively prohibit developers from accessing the near-field communication\n(NFC) hardware needed to provide tap-to-pay through a digital wallet app. 112.\nApple Wallet is the only app on the iPhone that can use NFC to facilitate tap-\ntopay. While Apple actively encourages banks, merchants, and other parties to\nparticipate in Apple Wallet, Apple simultaneously exerts its smartphone\nmonopoly to block these same partners from developing better payment products\nand services for iPhone users. 44\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 45 of 88 PageID: 45 113.\nApple also uses its smartphone monopoly to extract payments from banks, which\nneed to access customers that use digital wallets on iPhones. Since Apple\nfirst launched Apple Pay-long before it achieved meaningful adoption Apple has\ncharged issuing banks 15 basis points (0.15 percent) for each credit card\ntransaction mediated by Apple Pay. Payment apps from Samsung and Google are\nfree to issuing banks. Apple's fees are a significant expense for issuing\nbanks and cut into funding for features and benefits that banks might\notherwise offer smartphone users. The volume of impacted transactions is large\nand growing. A U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau report estimates that\nApple Pay facilitated nearly $200 billion in transactions in the United States\nin 2022. And the report goes on to explain that \u201canalysts estimate that the\nvalue of digital wallet tap-to-pay transactions will grow by over 150 percent\nby 2028.\" 114. Multiple app developers have sought direct NFC access for their\npayment or wallet apps. Yet Apple prohibits these developers from\nincorporating tap-to-pay functionality in their apps for fear that doing so\nwould \"be one way to disable [A]pple [P]ay trivially,\" leading to the\n\"proliferation of other payment apps\" that might operate cross-platform and\nultimately undermine Apple's smartphone monopoly. There is no technical\nlimitation on providing NFC access to developers seeking to offer third-party\nwallets. For example, Apple allows merchants to use the iPhone's NFC antenna\nto accept tap-to-pay payments from consumers. Apple also acknowledges it is\ntechnically feasible to enable an iPhone user to set another app (e.g., a\nbank's app) as the default payment app, and Apple intends to allow this\nfunctionality in Europe. 116. Apple further impedes the adoption of digital\nwallets by restricting others from offering the same ability to authenticate\ndigital payment options on online checkout pages. By 115. 45\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 46 of 88 PageID: 46 limiting\nthe ability of third-party wallets to provide a simple, fast, and\ncomprehensive solution to online purchasing, Apple further undermines the\nviability of such wallets. 117. Apple also blocks other digital wallets from\nserving as an alternative to Apple's in-app payment (IAP). This prevents these\nwallets from increasing their attractiveness and improving the overall user\nexperience on the iPhone by offering consumer experiences that may include use\nof rewards points in purchasing, digital receipts, returns, loyalty programs,\nand digital coupons for purchases of relevant subscriptions and digital goods.\nApple even prohibits developers on its App Store from notifying users in the\ndeveloper's app that cheaper prices for services are available using\nalternative digital wallets or direct payments. Apple's conduct reflects its\nknowing degradation of the experience of its own users by blocking them from\naccessing wallets that would have better or different features. In so doing,\nApple cements reliance on the iPhone and also imposes fees on a large and\ncritical slice of all digital wallet NFC transactions, which the U.S. Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau estimates will grow to $451 billion by 2028.\nApple's \"moat\" around its smartphone monopoly is wide and deep: it uses a\nsimilar playbook to maintain its monopoly through many other products and\nservices 118. C. The exclusionary and anticompetitive acts described above are\npart of Apple's ongoing course of conduct to build and maintain its smartphone\nmonopoly. They are hardly exhaustive. Rather, they exemplify the innovation\nApple has stifled and Apple's overall strategy of using its power over app\ndistribution and app creation to selectively block threatening 119.\ninnovations. 120. Apple has deployed a similar playbook for a much broader\nrange of third-party apps and services as well, many of which present\ntechnologies that function as middleware, 46\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 47 of 88 PageID: 47\nfacilitate switching, reduce the need for expensive hardware, or\ndisintermediate Apple's iPhone by enabling the development of cross-platform\ntechnologies. For instance, Apple has undermined third-party location\ntrackable devices that fully function across platforms. Apple has impaired\nthird-party, cross-platform video communications apps while steering users to\nits own video communication app, FaceTime. Apple has limited the capabilities\nof third-party iOS web browsers, including by requiring that they use Apple's\nbrowser engine, WebKit. Protocols that Apple has placed around new \"eSIM\"\ntechnology may introduce additional frictions for any user who seeks to\ntransition from an iPhone to a different phone while maintaining the same\nphone number. Apple has impeded cross-platform cloud storage apps in order to\nsteer iPhone users into iCloud, making data transfer between different devices\nmore difficult. Apple uses restrictions in sales channels to impede the sale\nand distribution of rival smartphones. And Apple has worsened its users'\nexperience by making it difficult for iPhone users to use superior voice and\nAI assistants and steering users to use Siri as a voice assistant. 121.\nUltimately, the strategies Apple has employed to date are not the only ones\nApple can use to achieve its anticompetitive and lucrative ends. As technology\nevolves, Apple continues to evolve and shift its anticompetitive behavior to\nprotect its monopoly power. For example, in recent years, Apple has\nincreasingly moved into offering its own subscription services, including\nnews, games, video, music, cloud storage, and fitness subscriptions that could\nbe used to keep users tethered to the platform. These subscription services\nand other ancillary fees are a significant part of Apple's net revenue. These\nsubscriptions services can also increase switching costs among iPhone users.\nIf an Apple user can only access their subscription service on an iPhone, they\nmay experience significant costs, time, lost content, and other frictions if\nthey attempt to switch to a non-Apple smartphone or subscription service. 47\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 48 of 88 PageID: 48 122.\nThese subscription services can also increase Apple's power over content\ncreators and newspapers, among others, by exerting control over how audiences\naccess their work, decreasing traffic to their websites and apps, and\npositioning Apple as the middleman or tollbooth operator in the relationship\nbetween creators and users. In so doing, Apple takes on outsize importance and\ncontrol in the creative economy, which may diminish incentives to fund, make,\nand distribute artistic expression. 123. In addition, when one road is closed\nto Apple, Apple has demonstrated its ability to find new roads to the same or\nworse ends. For example, Apple was recently ordered to stop blocking link-outs\nby third parties to their websites where users could buy the third party's\nproduct cheaper. In response, Apple reportedly allowed link-outs to websites\nbut now charges for purchases made on the web even if they are not an\nimmediate result of a click from a link in a native iPhone app. 124. Apple has\nalso attempted to undermine cross-platform technologies like digital car keys\nin ways that benefit Apple but harm consumers. For example, Apple has required\ndevelopers to add digital keys developed for their own apps to Apple Wallet as\nwell. The default status of Apple Wallet steers users to the Apple Wallet\nrather than allowing third parties to present digital car keys only in their\nown cross-platform app, increasing dependence on Apple and the iPhone whenever\nthey use their car. At the same time, it decreases the incentives of\nautomakers to innovate because automakers are forced to share data with Apple\nand prevented from differentiating themselves as they could absent Apple's\nconduct. 125. Apple's threatened dominance over the automotive industry goes\nwell beyond the Apple Wallet and Apple's demands on car makers to allow\ninnovative products and services on the iPhone. Apple's smartphone dominance\nextends to CarPlay, an Apple infotainment system 48\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 49 of 88 PageID: 49 that\nenables a car's central display to serve as a display for the iPhone and\nenables the driver to use the iPhone to control maps and entertainment in the\ncar. Like the smartphone market, infotainment systems are increasingly\nconsidered must-have capabilities in newer vehicles. After leveraging its\nsmartphone dominance to car infotainment systems, Apple has told automakers\nthat the next generation of Apple CarPlay will take over all of the screens,\nsensors, and gauges in a car, forcing users to experience driving as an\niPhone-centric experience if they want to use any of the features provided by\nCarPlay. Here too, Apple leverages its iPhone user base to exert more power\nover its trading partners, including American carmakers, in future innovation.\nBy applying the same playbook of restrictions to CarPlay, Apple further locks-\nin the power of the iPhone by preventing the development of other\ndisintermediating technologies that interoperate with the phone but reside off\ndevice. V. Anticompetitive Effects Apple's conduct harms the competitive\nprocess As described above, Apple protects its monopoly power in smartphones\nand performance smartphones by using its control over app distribution and app\ncreation to suppress or delay apps, innovations, and technologies that would\nreduce user switching costs or simply allow users to discover, purchase, and\nuse their own apps and content without having to rely on Apple. As a result,\nApple faces less competition from rival smartphones and less competitive\npressure from innovative, cross-platform technologies not because Apple makes\nits own products better but because it makes other products worse. With the\nbenefit of less competition, Apple extracts extraordinary profits and\nregulates innovation to serve its interests. This leaves all smartphone users\nworse off, with fewer choices, higher prices and fees, lower quality\nsmartphones, apps, and accessories, and less innovation from Apple and others.\nLeft unchallenged, Apple will continue to use and strengthen its smartphone\nmonopoly to dictate how 49 A. 126.\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 50 of 88 PageID: 50\ncompanies can create and distribute apps in the future so that they cannot\nthreaten Apple's smartphone monopolies. Apple's conduct has resulted in less\nchoice for smartphone users. Today, only two companies (Google and Samsung)\nremain as meaningful competitors to Apple in the premium smartphone market.\n127. 128. Even when users consider these alternatives, Apple's conduct has\nincreased the technical, behavioral, monetary, and other costs of switching\nfrom an iPhone to an alternative smartphone. This undermines competition and\nentrenches Apple's monopoly power. For example, according to user surveys, one\nof the biggest reasons iPhone users do not switch to rival smartphones today\nis to avoid the problems Apple has created for cross-platform messaging.\nLikewise, Apple exercised its control over app distribution and app creation\nto impede the development and growth of super apps, depriving users of\ntechnology that would have facilitated switching by decreasing user's\ndependence on Apple and the iPhone. Apple took a similar approach to cloud\nstreaming apps, delaying or suppressing technology that would have made it\neasier for users to switch to cheaper smartphones. Apple also used its control\nover app creation, including its control over critical APIs, to impose\ntechnical and contractual restrictions on messaging apps, third-party\nsmartwatches, and digital wallets, undermining cross-platform technologies\nthat would have helped users overcome switching costs and friction and\nultimately increased smartphone competition. 129. Apple's conduct has delayed\nor suppressed the emergence of cross-platform technologies that would put\ncompetitive pressure on Apple's ability to extract extraordinary profits from\nusers and developers. For example, if developers could distribute their\nprograms through super apps or cloud streaming apps, rather than the App\nStore, it would put competitive 50\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 51 of 88 PageID: 51 pressure\non Apple's ability to control app distribution and app creation as well as the\ntaxes Apple imposes on developers who want to distribute apps to iPhone users.\nSimilarly, third-party digital wallets, or other apps with tap-to-pay\nfunctionality, would benefit users and developers by putting more competitive\npressure on Apple as well. For example, digital wallets could eventually\nprovide developers an alternative way to process payments and manage customer\nrelationships, forcing Apple to compete more aggressively by lowering fees and\nimproving quality, which would ultimately benefit users. Instead, Apple\ncontinues to exert its power over customers and financial institutions when\nusers pay for something with their phone in the App Store, in an app, or\nincreasingly in the physical world with tap-to-pay. 130. Apple's conduct has\nharmed users in other ways. For example, third-party digital wallets would\nreduce Apple's ability to charge banks high fees when users make payments\nusing Apple Wallet, which ultimately cost consumers through higher prices or\nother reductions in quality. Alternative digital wallets could also provide\nsmartphone users better rewards, e.g., cash back, as well as a more private,\nsecure payment experience from a user's preferred financial institution rather\nthan being forced to go through Apple. But these tap-to-pay digital wallet\nproducts and services do not exist today because of Apple. 131. Apple's\nconduct has made its own products worse, sacrificing the short-term profits\nApple could earn from improving the iPhone in order to preserve the long-term\nvalue of maintaining its monopoly. In a competitive market, Apple would\ncompete aggressively to support the development of popular apps and\naccessories for iPhone users, which would in turn make iPhones more attractive\nto users and more valuable. But Apple takes steps to delay or suppress cross-\nplatform technologies that it recognizes would be popular with users, such as\nsuper apps and cloud streaming apps, because of the threat they pose to\nApple's smartphone 51\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 52 of 88 PageID: 52\nmonopolies. As a result, several developers have abandoned plans to develop\nsuper apps and cloud-based gaming apps even after making substantial\ninvestments in bringing them to market. Apple's conduct may have also slowed\nthe development of innovative, high-compute apps related to education,\nartificial intelligence, and productivity as well. Apple has also impeded\ninnovation by third-party smartwatches such that manufacturers have limited\nthe functionality of their smartwatches for iPhone users, suspended support\nfor iPhone compatibility because of Apple's restrictions, or canceled\ndevelopment of cross-platform smartwatches altogether. At least one company's\ncanceled smartwatch formed part of its overall wearables strategy, including\nfuture development of virtual-reality technology. Similarly, Apple degrades\nthird-party messaging apps, even though it makes cross-platform messaging less\nprivate and less secure for iPhone users, because doing so raises switching\ncosts. 132. Apple's conduct has harmed other smartphone users, too. Because of\nthe resources and risks required to maintain different features across\ndifferent smartphones, many potential super app, mini program, and other\ndevelopers do not implement features prohibited by Apple even on other\nsmartphones. For example, prospective digital wallet providers, including U.S.\nbanks, have abandoned the development of digital-wallet apps for either Apple\nor other smartphones. Another company decided not to offer users an innovative\ndigital car key in part because Apple required that company to add any\nfeatures related to the key into Apple Wallet rather than allowing that\ncompany to put its key solely in its own app. Other developers have shrunk,\nshuttered, or abandoned plans to launch super apps, cloud-streamed gaming\napps, smartwatches, and other apps. As a result, all smartphone users enjoy\nlower quality smartphones, less innovation, and less choice. 52\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 53 of 88 PageID: 53 133.\nApple's documents and conduct show that Apple is motivated by the\nanticompetitive purpose of building or maintaining monopoly power in the\nrelevant markets. For example, Apple sacrificed substantial revenues it could\nhave earned from super apps, mini programs, cloud streaming apps, and other\nthird-party apps and accessories. In particular, mobile gaming already\naccounts for a large and growing portion of Apple's revenue. Popular cloud\nstreamed gaming apps would offer iPhone users access to popular services\n(including games) and in turn generate significant revenue for Apple through\nsubscriptions and in-app purchases. Instead, Apple preferred the long-term\nbenefit of reduced smartphone competition to the revenue it would generate\nfrom cloud gaming, super apps, and mini programs or the quality (and consumer\ndemand) increase that would flow from this innovation. Apple has also used its\ncontrol over app distribution and app creation to selectively undermine cross-\nplatform technologies, not because this helps protect users but because it\nhelps protect Apple. 134. The harms to smartphone competition caused by\nApple's conduct are amplified by Apple's decision to grant itself exclusive\ndistribution rights to iPhone users through the Apple App Store. If Apple\nallowed users to access apps in other ways, users could choose an app store\nthat did not restrict super apps or mini programs, even if Apple ran its App\nStore the same way it does today. Apple does not allow that choice, however,\nbecause if it did developers could write their programs for any smartphone\nrather than specifically for iOS, just as internet browsers and Apple's\nQuickTime allowed developers to write programs that worked on a variety of\noperating systems not just Windows. That would lower users' switching costs\nand reduce users' and developers' dependence on Apple and the iPhone. 135.\nApple's smartphone monopoly gives it many levers to maintain its power even in\nthe face of interventions focused on eliminating or disciplining specific\nanticompetitive 53\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 54 of 88 PageID: 54\npractices. This is because Apple's iPhone monopoly, secured by its\nanticompetitive conduct, grants it the power to set the rules by which most\nsmartphone users buy digital and hardware products, and by which developers\nare allowed to sell these same products to users. If Apple is forced to change\nsome of these rules, it has the power to adopt new rules, restrictions, or\nfeatures that reinforce Apple's monopoly and harm competition in other ways.\nFor example, Apple has stated plans to adopt RCS due to market and\ninternational regulatory pressure. But Apple continues to contractually\nrestrict third parties from accessing other APIs and features that would\nenable cross-platform messaging apps. In another instance, Apple was enjoined\nfrom enforcing certain anti-steering provisions in its agreements with\ndevelopers. In response, Apple simply created a different set of onerous\nrestrictions on app developers to achieve a similar result. In other cases,\nApple has used its control over app distribution to force companies to comply\nwith Apple's policies that may contradict local laws by delaying the review of\nthe offending companies' apps. Apple has every incentive to use its monopoly\nplaybook in the future Apple's conduct does not just impact the past and\npresent but poses significant risk to the development of new innovations.\nApple may use its smartphone monopoly playbook to acquire or maintain power\nover next-frontier devices and technologies. As Apple grows its dominance,\nApple may continue delaying or stifling the innovations of cross-platform\ncompanies, in order to lock users into Apple devices. 137. Apple has countless\nproducts and services-AirPods, iPads, Music, Apple TV, photos, maps, iTunes,\nCarPlay, AirDrop, Apple Card, and Cash. These provide future avenues for Apple\nto engage in anticompetitive conduct and the ability to circumvent remedies.\nAppropriate forward-looking remedies are necessary to ensure that Apple cannot\nuse these products and services to further entrench its monopoly power. 54 B.\n136.\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 55 of 88 PageID: 55 138.\nApple's conduct extends beyond just monopoly profits and even affects the flow\nof speech. For example, Apple is rapidly expanding its role as a TV and movie\nproducer and has exercised that role to control content. 139. Apple has also\nattempted to use its monopoly to collect user data and stifle innovation in\nthe automotive industry by, among other things, impeding the development of\ndigital key technologies by requiring them to be offered in Apple's\nproprietary wallet product and creating new single points of power over\nemerging uses of the iPhone. These acts further reinforce Apple's power in the\niPhone by locking in Apple's services and excluding other alternative\ntechnologies that have the potential to disintermediate Apple's iPhone. 140.\nFinally, Apple's monopolization of smartphone markets gives it tremendous\npower over the lives of millions of Americans. Today, Apple uses that power to\nundermine rival smartphones, suppress innovative technologies, and stymie\nconsumer choice. Tomorrow, Apple may use its power to force its own users (and\ntheir data) to become its next profitable product. VI. Privacy, Security, and\nOther Alleged Countervailing Factors Do Not Justify Apple's Anticompetitive\nConduct 141. There are no valid, procompetitive benefits of Apple's\nexclusionary conduct that would outweigh its anticompetitive effects. Apple's\nmoat building has not resulted in lower prices, higher output, improved\ninnovation, or a better user experience for smartphone users. 142. Apple\nmarkets itself on the basis of privacy and security to differentiate itself\nfrom what competition is left in the smartphone market. But this does not\njustify Apple's monopolistic and anticompetitive conduct. Apple imposes\ncontractual restraints on app creation and distribution, imposes hefty fees on\nmany types of smartphone interactions, and conditionally restricts API access\non its smartphone platform simply because it can. There are limited if any\ncompetitive constraints on this conduct. As a point of comparison, Apple does\nnot engage in 55\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 56 of 88 PageID: 56 such\nconduct on its Mac laptops and computers. It gives developers the freedom to\ndistribute software directly to consumers on Mac without going through an\nApple-controlled app store and without paying Apple app store fees. This still\nprovides a safe and secure experience for Mac users, demonstrating that\nApple's control over app distribution and creation on the iPhone is\nsubstantially more restrictive than necessary to protect user privacy and\nsecurity. 143. In fact, many alternative technologies that Apple's conduct\nsuppresses would enhance user security and privacy. For example, Apple's\nconduct targeting digital wallets forces users to share information with Apple\neven if they would prefer to share that information solely with their bank,\nmedical provider, or other trusted third party. In particular, when an iPhone\nuser provisions a credit or debit card into Apple Wallet, Apple intervenes in\na process that could otherwise occur directly between the user and card issuer\nintroducing an additional point of failure for privacy and security. Likewise,\nsuper apps or alternative app stores could offer users and their families a\nmore curated selection of apps that better protect user privacy and security.\nIndeed, Apple allows enterprise and public sector customers to offer more\ncurated app stores on employee iPhones because it better protects privacy and\nsecurity. 144. Apple is also willing to make the iPhone less secure and less\nprivate if that helps maintain its monopoly power. For example, text messages\nsent from iPhones to Android phones are unencrypted as a result of Apple's\nconduct. If Apple wanted to, Apple could allow iPhone users to send encrypted\nmessages to Android users while still using iMessage on their iPhone, which\nwould instantly improve the privacy and security of iPhone and other\nsmartphone users. 145. Similarly, Apple is willing to sacrifice user privacy\nand security in other ways so long as doing so benefits Apple. For example,\nApple allows developers to distribute apps through its App Store that collect\nvast amounts of personal and sensitive data about users 56\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 57 of 88 PageID: 57\nincluding children at the expense of its users' privacy and security. Apple\nalso enters agreements to share in the revenue generated from advertising that\nrelies on harvesting users' personal data. For example, Apple accepts massive\npayments from Google to set its search engine as the default in the Safari web\nbrowser even though Apple recognizes that other search engines better protect\nuser privacy. 146. Finally, Apple selectively enforces its rules and\ncontractual restrictions for app distribution and app creation. For example,\nwhen it benefits Apple to do so, Apple permits developers to introduce mini\nprograms, stream content from the cloud, use virtual currency, and receive\nspecial permissions or access APIs not automatically available to everyone.\n147. Ultimately, Apple chooses to make the iPhone private and secure when\ndoing so benefits Apple; Apple chooses alternative courses when those courses\nhelp Apple protect its monopoly power. Apple's conduct underscores the\npretextual nature of any claim that Apple's conduct is justified by protecting\nuser privacy or security. VII. The Smartphone Industry A. Background 148.\nMobile phones are portable devices that enable communications over radio\nfrequencies instead of telephone landlines. These signals are transmitted by\nequipment covering distinct geographic areas, or \"cells,\" which is why mobile\nphones were called cell phones. The first commercial cell phones became\navailable in the 1980s. Since then, improvements in both cell phone components\nand wireless technology have made it possible to transfer large volumes of\ndata around the globe in a short period. As a result, mobile phones began to\noffer a wider array of features and the adoption of mobile phones dramatically\nincreased. Today, nearly all American adults own a mobile phone. 57\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 58 of 88 PageID: 58 149.\nSmartphones combine the functionality of a traditional mobile phone with\nadvanced hardware and software components. Smartphones not only make phone\ncalls, but allow users to listen to music, send text messages, take pictures,\nplay games, access software for work, manage their finances, and browse the\ninternet. Consumers choose between smartphones based, in part, on their\nfunctionality. Today, smartphone functionality is driven in large part, though\nnot exclusively, by a combination of hardware and software components. Thus,\nin a competitive market, smartphone manufacturers would compete and innovate\nto provide the best functionality. 150. Although consumers could replace some\nsmartphone functionality with separate devices such as by always carrying a\ncamera and laptop, they generally prefer to access this combination of\nfunctionality as part of a single device. Thus, phones with some but not all\nof these features are not reasonable substitutes for smartphones. For example,\na Canon or Nikon camera is not a substitute for an Apple or Samsung smartphone\nnotwithstanding that both these products are capable of taking digital\npictures. Smartphone Hardware B. 151. A smartphone's hardware includes the\nframe and screen. Higher performing smartphones are typically constructed from\nbetter materials like glass and metal instead of plastic, manufactured to\nhigher standards that make them more durable (e.g., water and dust proof), and\nhave higher quality displays. 152. A smartphone's hardware also includes the\nsemiconductor chipsets that run the smartphone: central processing of software\ninstructions, graphics, video, display, memory, storage, and connection to\nwireless networks. Chipsets that offer superior performance-faster processing\nand network connections, better graphics, more storage\u2014are costly. As a\nresult, smartphone manufacturers typically include them only in more expensive\nperformance smartphones. 58 data\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 59 of 88 PageID: 59 153.\nSmartphone hardware includes other important components like cameras, and\nposition and motion sensors. Performance smartphones typically have higher\nquality cameras, better battery life, wireless charging, and advanced\nbiometrics such as face scanning. 154. Smartphones also contain several types\nof antennas that allow the phone to communicate with other smartphones,\naccessories, or other devices using standard communication protocols such as\nWi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Near-Field Communications (NFC). Wi-Fi is a wireless\nnetworking technology that uses radio waves to provide wireless high-speed\nInternet access through mobile devices, computers, printers, and other\nequipment. \"Wi-Fi,\" in particular, refers to IEEE 802.11 standards that define\nthe protocols that enable communications with current Wi-Fi-enabled wireless\ndevices such as wireless routers and access points. Bluetooth is a wireless\nstandard that allows smartphones to use shortwave radios to communicate with\naccessories like headphones and smartwatches. An industrywide Bluetooth\nstandard specifies technological requirements to ensure that all Bluetooth\ndevices can recognize and interact with each other. A typical Bluetooth signal\nhas a range of about 30 feet. Near Field Communication (NFC) allows\nsmartphones to interact with NFCenabled devices like a credit card terminal at\na coffee shop. NFC relies on shortrange wireless technologies, including radio\nsignals, to communicate and share information. To operate, two NFC-enabled\ndevices must typically be within four centimeters or less of one another. 155.\nThree device manufacturers, Apple, Samsung, and Google, account for\napproximately 94 percent of all smartphones by revenue in the United States.\nApple and a. b. C. 59\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 60 of 88 PageID: 60 Samsung\nalone account for approximately 90 percent of all smartphone revenues in the\nUnited States. 156. Cloud-based technologies are run using hardware and\nsoftware in remote computing centers (\"the cloud\") rather than by hardware and\nsoftware on a smartphone. The user experiences the technology on the phone but\nthe complex computing that generates the rich experience and that executes the\nuser's commands happens in the cloud. Thus, cloud apps can deliver rich\nexperiences on smartphones with less capable hardware than iPhones currently\ncontain. Smartphone Operating Systems, Applications, and Other Software In\naddition to hardware, smartphones include various software components that\nmake a smartphone more attractive to users. 158. The most important software\ncomponent is a smartphone's operating system, the foundational software that\nmanages both the hardware and other software programs on the device. All\niPhones are preloaded with Apple's proprietary, exclusive iPhone operating\nsystem called iOS. The only other significant mobile operating system in the\nUnited States is Google's Android, which works with smartphones manufactured\nby Samsung, whose U.S. headquarters is located in this district, Google,\nMotorola, and smaller players. Software applications, known as \u201capps,\u201d are\nprograms that perform specific tasks at the smartphone user's request, such as\nsending messages, playing music, or web browsing. Apps depend on a\nsmartphone's operating system to function. For example, to make a video call,\napps must communicate with a smartphone's operating system to access various\nhardware components on the phone, such as the camera, microphone, and speaker.\nApps communicate with a smartphone's operating system through application\nprogramming interfaces (APIs). C. 157. 60\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 61 of 88 PageID: 61 159.\nApps that work with a particular smartphone operating system are called native\napps. Thus, Apple's native iOS apps work with iPhone and native Android apps\nwork with Android smartphones. 160. Most app developers do not view Android as\na substitute for iOS or iOS as a substitute for Android. The overwhelming\nmajority of users choose a single phone and do not \"multi-home\" by carrying an\nAndroid phone and the iPhone at the same time. Thus, a developer cannot reach\niPhone users on Android or Android users on iPhones. Due to the lack of user\nmulti-homing, most developers create native apps for both iOS and Android to\nreach the greatest number of smartphone users. For example, a food delivery or\nride-sharing app cannot develop an app just for Android phones or just for the\niPhone. Developing for both platforms is often necessary for developers to\nreach the scale they need to be viable. It is also important to develop apps\nfor the iPhone and other smartphone platforms because most apps are\nincreasingly \"social\" in nature and require users on one platform to reach\nusers on the other. For example, the developer of a dating app must enable its\nusers on iPhones to meet users on Android and vice-versa. A money-sharing app\nmust enable users on Android devices to send money to users on iPhones and\nvice versa. 162. App developers typically provide a similar user experience\nfor native apps on iPhones and Android smartphones to minimize the resources\nand risks of maintaining different features across different smartphones. Even\nso, developers must program native apps to work with a specific operating\nsystem and so they do not always interoperate or synchronize across different\noperating systems. 161. 163. Middleware is software that provides similar APIs\nand functionality across a diverse set of operating systems and devices. This\nallows developers to create cross-platform 61\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 62 of 88 PageID: 62\napplications without having to write separate code for individual operating\nsystems or devices because developers can rely on the APIs exposed by the\nmiddleware rather than APIs that only work on specific operating systems or\ndevices. Apple has long understood how middleware can help promote competition\nand its myriad benefits, including increased innovation and output, by\nincreasing scale and interoperability. As Apple's then-Senior Vice President\nof Software Engineering testified during the government's landmark\nmonopolization case in United States v. Microsoft: \"Because we have created\nQuickTime for both Windows and Macintosh computers, developers can write a\nsingle version of a content product that will run on both Macintosh and\nWindows, without the additional expense of 'porting' the product to different\noperating systems.\" In the context of smartphones, examples of middleware\ninclude internet browsers, internet or cloud-based apps, super apps, and\nsmartwatches, among other products and services. While not meeting the\ntechnical definition of middleware, certain other products and services may\nnonetheless have the same economic impact as middleware, such as eliminating\nthe added expense of porting a product or experience across hardware or\noperating systems. For the purposes of this complaint middleware refers to\nboth technical middleware and to products and services that, while not\ntechnically middleware, have the same economic effect. D. Relevant Markets\n164. All smartphones compete against each other in a broad relevant market.\nBut industry participants, including Apple, assess competition among\nsmartphones in narrower markets that are best understood as submarkets of the\nlarger all-smartphone market. Because Apple chooses not to compete to sell new\nsmartphones in the entry-level tier, the most relevant market to assess its\nconduct is a narrower submarket that excludes this tier. Regardless of how the\nmarket is drawn, however, Apple's conduct is unlawful. 62\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 63 of 88 PageID: 63 iv.\nPerformance smartphones are a relevant product market 165. Performance\nsmartphones are a narrower relevant product market within the broader\nsmartphone market. This narrower market includes those smartphones that\ncompete with most iPhones and excludes the lowest-end smartphones, which\nindustry participants sometimes refer to as \"entry-level\" smartphones. 166.\nIndustry participants recognize performance smartphones as distinct and\nfrequently group smartphones into tiers that include entry-level smartphones\nand higher tiers such as \"premium\" or \"flagship.\" 167. Apple has also long\nrecognized a distinction between these higher-end smartphones and lower-end,\nentry-level smartphones. Apple's own documents indicate it does not view\nentry-level smartphones as competing with the iPhone and other performance\nsmartphones. 168. Performance smartphones have distinct characteristics and\nuses as compared to other smartphones. For example, entry-level smartphones\nare generally made with lower-quality materials and are less durable (e.g.,\nplastic instead of metal and glass). They have lowerperformance components\nsuch as slower processors and lower-capacity storage, which prevent users from\nrunning more intensive applications or storing large volumes of pictures and\ndata on the device. Entry-level smartphones often lack features such as an NFC\nantenna that allows consumers to use their phone to make payments or access\npasses for public transit. 169. Consumers typically purchase performance\nsmartphones under different terms than entry-level smartphones. Consumers\ngenerally use entry-level smartphones along with prepaid service plans. By\ncontrast, consumers usually purchase performance smartphones for use with\npost-paid service plans that include promotional discounts to consumers who\npurchase performance smartphones. 63\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 64 of 88 PageID: 64 170.\nBecause of these differences, among others, between entry-level smartphones\nand performance smartphones, entry-level smartphones are not reasonable\nsubstitutes for performance smartphones. 171. Moreover, competition from non-\nperformance smartphones is not sufficient today to prevent Apple from\nexercising monopoly power in the performance smartphone market. V. Smartphones\nare a broader relevant product market Smartphones are a relevant product\nmarket. Smartphones are distinct from phones that offer less capable hardware\nand software options than smartphones. These other phones, sometimes called\n\"feature phones,\" may offer basic web browsing in addition to calling and\nmessaging options, but do not offer the breadth of access to the internet or\nthird-party apps as smartphones. Similarly, these phones often have lower-\nquality hardware, such as poorer displays, less capable cameras, and rely on\nphysical keyboards instead of smartphone touch screens. Thus, these phones are\nnot reasonable substitutes for smartphones. 173. Smartphones are also distinct\nfrom other portable devices, such as tablets, smartwatches, and laptop\ncomputers. These devices lack the combination of function, size, and\nportability that consumers rely on in a smartphone, even if they offer some\nsimilar capabilities. Thus, none of these other products are reasonable\nsubstitutes for smartphones. 174. Apple, other participants in the market, and\nthe public recognize that smartphones are distinct from feature phones and\nother portable devices. 175. Competition from feature phones, or other\nalternatives, is not sufficient to prevent Apple from exercising monopoly\npower in the smartphone market. 172. 64\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 65 of 88 PageID: 65 The\nUnited States is a relevant geographic market for performance smartphones and\nsmartphones 176. The United States is a relevant geographic market for the\nsale of performance smartphones and smartphones. Users in the United States\ndemand services offered by U.S. retailers when they purchase a smartphone. For\nexample, consumers who purchase a smartphone from their mobile carrier can get\nassistance with activating their new device, setting it up, and transferring\nimportant content like apps, messages, photos, and video to their new\nsmartphone. A smartphone purchased abroad for use in the United States might\nbe incompatible with the consumer's domestic carrier, may not have the\nnecessary radio technology to take advantage of the carrier's highest speed\nconnections, the carrier might not be able to offer support during setup or\nsubsequently, or the phone's warranty may be invalid. 177. Consumers must also\npurchase smartphones through a U.S. retailer if they want to take advantage of\nvaluable promotions offered by their mobile carrier. These same promotions and\nfree financing are unavailable to U.S. consumers who purchase their phones in\nother vi. countries. 178. Finally, potential new smartphone entrants to the\nU.S. market must also comply with telecommunications regulations and satisfy\nother legal requirements. No extensive regulatory framework governs how Apple\noperates its platform with respect to developers, but there are a number of\nregulatory requirements that must be met in order to enter the smartphone\nmarket. For example, some smartphone makers are effectively barred from\noffering their smartphones to U.S. consumers. 179. Consumers in the United\nStates could not avoid or defeat an increase in the price of performance\nsmartphones or smartphones by purchasing and importing smartphones from\nabroad. This allows Apple to set prices for the same smartphone in the United\nStates separately 65\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 66 of 88 PageID: 66 from\nthose in other countries. For example, Apple lowered the price of the iPhone\n11 in China relative to the United States because Apple faced greater\ncompetition in China. This additional competition arises in part because a\npopular super app put competitive pressure on Apple and made it easier for\nusers to switch from an iPhone to a rival smartphone. As a result, Apple is\nunable to command the same prices for the iPhone in China than they do in the\nUnited States due to less competition. E. 180. Apple has monopoly power in the\nsmartphone and performance smartphone markets Apple has monopoly power in the\nsmartphone and performance smartphone markets because it has the power to\ncontrol prices or exclude competition in each of them. Apple also enjoys\nsubstantial and durable market shares in these markets. Moreover, Apple's\nmarket shares likely underestimate Apple's power because they are protected by\nsignificant barriers to entry, network effects, and switching costs. Apple\nrecognizes and exploits these barriers to entry, network effects, and\nswitching costs to protect itself from competition from rival platforms and\ninnovations, products, and services that may diminish consumer reliance on the\niPhone. Apple's power will likely increase over time. 181. In the U.S. market\nfor performance smartphones, where Apple views itself as competing, Apple\nestimates its market share exceeds 70 percent. These estimates likely\nunderstate Apple's market share today. For example, Apple's share among key\ndemographics, including younger audiences and higher-income households, is\neven larger. Even in the broadest market consisting of all smartphones\nincluding many smartphones that Apple and industry participants do not view as\ncompeting with Apple's iPhones and other higher-end phones\u2014 Apple's share is\nmore than 65 percent by revenue. Similarly, even if consumers choose one phone\nover another, the vast majority of developers consider iPhones and Android\ndevices as 66\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 67 of 88 PageID: 67\ncomplements because developers must build apps that run on both platforms due\nto the lack of user multi-homing. In effect, the lack of multi-homing among\nusers necessitates multi-homing among developers. This market reality\nincreases the power that Apple is able to exercise over developers that seek\nto reach users on smartphones\u2014especially performance smartphones that run\nsophisticated apps. 182. Apple's high market shares are durable. Over the last\ndecade, Apple increased its share of smartphones sold in the United States\nmost years. Through the same period, Apple collected more than half the\nrevenue for all smartphones sold in the United States. Apple's monopoly power\nin the relevant markets is protected by substantial barriers to entry and\nexpansion. For example, since fewer than ten percent of smartphone purchasers\nin the United States are buying their first smartphone, there are fewer new\ncustomers available for Apple's rivals. Instead, rivals must encourage\nexisting iPhone users to switch from using an iPhone to using another\nsmartphone when they replace or upgrade their phone. As a result, switching\ncosts-many created or exacerbated by Apple-impose substantial barriers to\nentry and expansion for rival smartphones. This barrier is increasingly\nimpenetrable. Nearly 90 percent of iPhone owners in the United States replace\ntheir iPhone with another iPhone. At least one U.S. carrier estimates that as\nhigh as 98 percent of iPhone users on its network replace or upgrade their\niPhone in a given quarter by buying another iPhone. The increased switching\ncosts that consumers experience because of Apple's conduct underpins these\nexceedingly high 183. retention rates. 184. Apple's monopoly power in the\nrelevant markets is protected by other barriers to entry, expansion, or\nrepositioning as well. For example, introducing a new smartphone requires\nconsiderable investments in acquiring expensive and scarce components such as\nmobile chips 67\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 68 of 88 PageID: 68 and\nspecialized glass for screens. Other significant barriers to entry include\nproduct design, software development, regulatory approval, manufacturing,\nmarketing, and customer service. Because most smartphones are bought through\nmobile carriers including Verizon, which has its operations headquarters in\nthis district, new entrants or those seeking to expand or reposition must meet\nthe carriers' technical requirements to access the major carrier networks in\nthe United States. New entrants and smaller rivals must also negotiate\ndistribution agreements and persuade carriers and other retailers to promote\ntheir products to consumers. As explained above, rival smartphones must also\novercome the substantial network effects generated by interactions between\nusers, developers, and others who interact with the iPhone. 185. Apple's\niPhone platform is protected by several additional barriers to entry and\nexpansion, including strong network and scale effects and high switching costs\nand frictions. For example, if an iPhone user wants to buy an Android\nsmartphone, they are likely to face significant financial, technological, and\nbehavioral obstacles to switching. The user may need to re-learn how to\noperate their smartphone using a new interface, transfer large amounts of data\n(e.g., contacts), purchase new apps, or transfer or buy new subscriptions and\naccessories. These switching costs and frictions are even higher when software\napplications, APIs, and other functionality do not help the different devices\nand operating systems communicate and interoperate. These switching costs and\nfrictions increase the \"stickiness\" of the iPhone, making users more beholden\nto the smartphone manufacturer and platform operator. 186. Many prominent,\nwell-financed companies have tried and failed to successfully enter the\nrelevant markets because of these entry barriers. Past failures include Amazon\n(which released its Fire mobile phone in 2014 but could not profitably sustain\nits business and exited the following year); Microsoft (which discontinued its\nmobile business in 2017); HTC (which exited 68\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 69 of 88 PageID: 69 the\nmarket by selling its smartphone business to Google in September 2017); and LG\n(which exited the smartphone market in 2021). Today, only Samsung and Google\nremain as meaningful competitors in the U.S. performance smartphone market.\nBarriers are so high that Google is a distant third to Apple and Samsung\ndespite the fact that Google controls development of the Android operating\nsystem. 187. Apple's monopoly power is separately demonstrated by direct\nindicia. For example, Apple can and does profitably forego innovation without\nfear of losing customers to competitors. For example, Apple's vice president\nof iPhone marketing explained in February 2020: \"In looking at it with\nhindsight, I think going forward we need to set a stake in the ground for what\nfeatures we think are 'good enough' for the consumer. I would argue were [sic]\nalready doing *more* than what would have been good enough.\" After identifying\nold features that \"would have been good enough today if we hadn't introduced\n[updated features] already,\" she explained, \"anything new and especially\nexpensive needs to be rigorously challenged before it's allowed into the\nconsumer phone.\" 188. Apple's profits and profit margins, for nearly every\naspect of the iPhone, are further evidence of Apple's monopoly power. For\nexample, Apple's per-unit smartphone profit margins are far more than its next\nmost profitable rival. Apple charges carriers considerably more than its\nrivals to buy and resell its smartphones to the public and employs contract\nclauses that may impede the ability of carriers to promote rival smartphones,\na harmful exercise of monopoly power that is hidden to most consumers. Apple\nextracts fees from developers as much as 30 percent when users purchase apps\nor make in-app payments. Apple also extracts a 0.15 percent commission from\nbanks on credit card transactions through its digital wallet, while none of\nits smartphone competitors with digital wallets charge any fee. Apple predicts\nthat it will 69\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 70 of 88 PageID: 70 collect\nnearly $1 billion in worldwide revenue on Apple Pay fees by 2025. A recent\nreport by the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau suggest these revenues\nwill only increase, as \"analysts expect the value of digital wallet tap-to-pay\ntransactions will grow by over 150 percent by 2028.\" 189. Apple increasingly\ncharges developers additional fees to promote their apps in the App Store as\nwell. In fact, this is one of the fastest-growing parts of Apple's services\nbusiness, with revenue \"increasing by more than a third to $4.4B in FY 2022.\"\n190. These indicia of Apple's monopoly power are direct evidence of its\nmonopoly power in the relevant markets. VIII. Jurisdiction, Venue, and\nCommerce 191. The United States brings this action pursuant to Section 4 of\nthe Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C \u00a7 4, to prevent and restrain Apple's violations of\nSection 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. 192. The Attorneys General assert\nthese claims based on their independent authority to bring this action\npursuant to Section 16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 26, and common law, to\nobtain injunctive and other equitable relief based upon Apple's\nanticompetitive practices in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2. 193. The Attorneys General are the chief legal officers of their\nrespective states. They have authority to bring actions to protect the\neconomic wellbeing of their states and residents, and to seek injunctive\nrelief to remedy and protect against harm resulting from violations of the\nantitrust laws. 194. Apple's actions and course of conduct are ongoing and are\nlikely to continue or recur, including through other practices with the same\npurpose or effect. 70\n\nCase 2:24-cv-04055 Document 1 Filed 03/21/24 Page 71 of 88 PageID: 71 195.\nApple's actions complained of herein have harmed, and continue to harm,\ncompetition, consumers, and the general welfare and economies of the Plaintiff\nStates. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action under\nSection 4 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 4, and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1337(a),\nand 1345. 196. The Court has personal jurisdiction over Apple, and venue is\nproper in this District under Section 12 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 22,\nand under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391, because Apple transacts business and is found\nwithin this District. 197. Apple is a corporation headquartered in Cupertino,\nCalifornia. Apple is one of the largest publicly traded companies in the\nworld, generating hundreds of billions of dollars from the sale of\nsmartphones, computers, tablets, and related services and accessories. 198.\nApple engages in, and its activities substantially affect, interstate trade\nand commerce. Apple provides a range of products and services that are\nmarketed, distributed, and offered to consumers throughout the United States,\nin the plaintiff States, across state lines, and internationally.

While each of Apple's acts\nis anticompetitive in its own right, Apple's interrelated and interdependent\nactions have had a cumulative and self-reinforcing effect that has harmed\ncompetition and the competitive process. Apple's anticompetitive acts have had\nharmful effects on competition and consumers. 204. Apple's exclusionary\nconduct lacks a procompetitive justification that offsets the harm caused by\nApple's anticompetitive and unlawful conduct.
