Center for\nJewish History, New York. Public Domain.\n\nThroughout the history of mankind, no group has been more victimised than the\nJewish people. Today they are remembered for being mass-murdered in Hitler's\ndeath camps, yet their persecution goes back thousands of years. Why? In order\nto understand how Hitler was to use the Jews as scapegoats, we must first\nunderstand the latent hatred that Hitler was able to tap into against the\nJewish people, not just in Germany but all over Europe.\n\n### Biblical Times\n\nMuch of the history of the Jewish people can be found in the Old Testament, in\nwhich we learn that the Jews are the 'chosen people'. By making a covenant\nwith God, they would, in return for being chosen, obey his laws. After their\nexile in Egypt the Jewish people were led back by Moses into Israel, where, by\nforce of arms, they were able to carve out a land of their own around 1100 BC.\n\nIn the century before the birth of Christ, the Middle East and Judea were\nconquered by the Romans under Pompey and became part of the Roman Empire. From\nthe New Testament, Christians learn how the Romans governed Judea, and it is\nunder Pilate's orders - and amid Jewish cries of 'Crucify him!' - that Jesus\nwas executed. The Romans found the Jews with their one god to be a troublesome\npeople. They would not allow Roman gods to be worshipped in their temples even\nthough the Romans (although not always) respected the God of the Jews.\n\nUnrest broke out and the Romans put down the disturbances ruthlessly. After\nthe fall of Masada, Jewish resistance was broken and the Romans expelled the\nJews from Judea in AD 135 (the Diaspora). At this point we would expect the\nJews to leave history in the manner of the other ancient civilisations, such\nas the Babylonians and the Hittites; but no, the Jewish people survived even\nthough they were dispersed throughout the Roman Empire and beyond. If we\nunderstand why, we also begin to understand the persecution that followed.\n\n###### Read Next: The Roman Destruction of Jerusalem\n\n### Keeping the Faith\n\nThe contract with God bound the Jewish people together: if they kept his\nrules, then, whatever else happened, they would remain his chosen people. This\nbelief gave a sense of faith and identity which was to hold the Jewish people\ntogether but also to alienate them from other cultures. The strict rules that\nhad to be followed did not always match with the rules of the different\nsocieties in which the Jews now lived. They had, as far as possible, to reduce\ntheir contact with the outside society so that it would be easier to keep\ntheir own laws. Keeping themselves apart was the main way in which the Jewish\npeople would survive, yet it was also the main factor in their persecution. As\nvisible outsiders, they were seen to be aloof, strange, exotic - and even\nevil.\n\nIf the Jewish faith had been one of conversion like the Christian or Muslim\nreligions, then it would have been a direct threat to other societies and the\nJewish faith would have either triumphed or been vanquished. Yet neither\noccurred. Being Jewish depended on being born into the religion, and the Jews\nwould only take converts very reluctantly into their faith.\n\nBeing outsiders was bad enough, but having power as well represented a threat\nto the upper levels of the societies in which they were living. Unlike the\nChristian faith in its early days where the word of God was given to the\npeople by their priests, who were often the only group of people who could\nread, all Jewish males were required to be literate in order to read the Torah\nand to debate its contents. Two factors are important: one, the ability to\nread, which in the Dark Ages and Middle Ages was rare; second, not to accept\nblindly what was read but to interrupt and debate. This meant that the Jewish\npeople were a literate society which encouraged the art of debate and the\nsearch for knowledge.\n\n### The Rewards\n\nIt was no wonder, then, that the Jewish people were to provide society's\nprofessional classes, including doctors, lawyers, advisers and bankers. In\nsocieties before the modern age, wealth was land and its ownership. Landowners\ndid not 'work', since they ruled and also fought as soldiers. The Jews had no\nland and were often banned by the societies they were living in from owning\nland. Yet they had the skills which the landed classes wanted but were\nunwilling to acquire themselves: 'labourers' and 'cannon fodder' the ruling\nclasses had in plenty, but of doctors there were few.\n\nThe Jews were paid for their services in cash but with this cash they often\ncould not purchase land, and so they ended up with the capital required to run\nmoney-lending firms and banks. This factor, combined with the Christian ban on\nusury, meant that Jews were often forced to act as their adopted society's\nbankers.\n\nFrom this we can see that the Jews were an independent people who lived all\nover the known world and who cut themselves off from the indigenous people of\nthe area in which they lived; but at the same time they provided essential\nservices for those same indigenous people. This gave the Jews power that could\nbe abused or that could seem threatening to the local population. However,\npower was also a defence for the Jewish society against possible persecution.\n\nThe Jews, in addition to having money and power, also had knowledge. In a time\nwhen there was little movement of people or ideas, the Jews were unique. All\nover the known world there were Jewish settlements, and in all these societies\nthe Jewish people learnt both the language of the local people and their\nknowledge and wisdom. This knowledge was then dispersed among the Jewish\npeople through their travels and, of course, through books which the Jews\ncould read. Ideas spread but stayed within the Jewish community. So a Jewish\ndoctor might cure a patient in Scotland with knowledge gained from Syria.\nHowever, again there was a danger, for what was common sense in Syria might be\nperceived as 'Black Magic' in Scotland.\n\n###### Read Next: Jews and the Renaissance\n\n### Persecution\n\nThe first persecutions against the Jewish people were religious. They were\n'killers of Christ' and 'black magic worshippers' who did not follow or\nbelieve in Jesus. We can see that hatred was felt by the local populations;\nbut it was the leaders of the different societies which stirred up that hate,\nand their reasons for doing so could be mixed. Among the ring-leaders might be\na zealot Christian church leader, a knight in debt to a Jewish money-lender, a\njealous doctor or a usurped advisor to a king.\n\nIn the 19th century religious persecution gave way to racial persecution. The\nJews were seen as parasites. This change in attitude came from a volatile brew\nof Social Darwinism and rising European nationalism. The Jews were seen to be\nthe outsiders who not only did not belong but needed to be removed as a threat\nto society. This is the sort of emotion Hitler experienced when living in old\nImperial Vienna before 1914.\n\nMore sinister, in both cases, religious and racial persecution are a facade\nfor the real reason that the Jews were seen as threatening, namely the fear\nand threat from an outside group who through history had a position of power\nthat created jealously which turned to violence in troubled times.\n\nIn the 20th century another factor for persecution can be added, and this is\nthe Jewish connection to Communism. In 1897 in Basel, the first Zionist\nconference was held. Theodore Herzl, the father of Zionism, talked of sending\nJews to Palestine to build a homeland. The Zionist thinkers talked of a\nsociety which was less class-driven - Socialism. In 1917 the Russian\nrevolution took place and, among its leaders, Trotsky was Jewish. Trotsky\nbelieved in a world revolution, and his call was first answered in Germany,\nwhere many of the leaders in the 'Munich Soviet' of 1918-19 were Jewish. Thus\nthe greatest radical idea of the 20th century was to be linked to Jewish\nthinkers. In Nazi Germany, Social Darwinism, Communism, Socialism and war-\nprofiteering were to be mixed and brewed to become the hatred that Hitler\nstirred up from the 1920s to the 1940s.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAnti-Semitism was not a creation of Hitler. It has been part of European\nsociety for over 2000 years. The Jewish religion and the attempt to maintain\nit, when the Jews were expelled from their homeland by the Romans, was the key\nfactor in their survival as a group; but by being a recognisable group who had\npower they seemed to threaten many of their adopted societies.\n\nThe fate of the Jews is the fate of all minorities the world over. They are\naccepted when they are not a danger to their adopted society, but turned on\nwhenever they might appear threatening. The murder of the Jews in the\nHolocaust remains a 'beacon of remembrance' of what society can do when it\nturns on a group of its citizens.\n\nHitler tapped into the tendency that lies in all individuals to blame those\nwho-are 'not like us' in times of troubles. Though there may be elements of\ntruth behind our blame and hatred, the issues are far more complex than the\n'black-and-white' world Hitler and his like want people to believe in. We do\nnot hate an individual for his racial affiliation or belief, but we are made\nto hate a stereotype which we often have never met.\n\nFurther Reading:\n\n  * N. Cantor and R.
