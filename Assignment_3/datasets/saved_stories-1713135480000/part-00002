But if\nyou then work for a business or start a business, you will find that what you\nlearned is far from adequate, and some of what you were taught in economics\nclass you would be better off unlearning.\n\n####\n\nThe Complexity of Business Strategy\n\nIn the economics class, the emphasis is on two extreme types of markets. There\nis no strategy involved in either type. The firm just mechanically decides how\nmuch to produce.\n\nOne market type is called \u201cperfect competition,\u201d in which every firm must\ncharge the market price. Charge a penny more and you lose all your customers.\nCharge a penny less and you get plenty of sales, but you lose money on each\none. Given the market price, the right amount to produce turns out to be the\namount that minimizes average cost (I don\u2019t want to waste time here explaining\nthis\u2014consult an economics textbook if you care).\n\nThe other market is a monopoly. The monopolist faces no competition. It has\nthe entire market to itself. It picks the single price that maximizes profits.\nIt produces the amount that will match demand at that price. (Again, consult a\ntextbook if you need more explanation.) Economic textbooks assume that the\nmonopolist knows its demand curve, meaning that it knows how much it can sell\nat various prices. In the real world, you will never meet a firm, monopolist\nor otherwise, that knows its demand curve.\n\nIn the real world, the most common types of markets are imperfect competition\nand oligopoly. Even if the market demand curve were known, each firm would\nface uncertainty, because one firm\u2019s demand depends on what other firms choose\nto do.\n\nImperfect competition and oligopoly give rise to problems of strategy.\nTextbooks mention them, but they do not like to dwell on these cases. The\ncomplex, multidimensional nature of strategic choices seems to turn off most\neconomists.\n\nIn an oligopoly, there are a few firms in the market, and they watch each\nother. They try to jockey for advantage. But they also try to be careful not\nto compete too aggressively.\n\nFor example, in the late 1980s and early 1990s I was with Freddie Mac, which\nbought mortgages from orginators and sold securities backed by those\nmortgages. Our lone competitor was Fannie Mae, which made the two firms an\noligopoly. We could compete on many dimensions in order to induce sellers to\nchoose Freddie over Fannie. We could offer lower fees for guaranteeing\nmortgages. We could alter our fees based on perceived risk of the loans,\ntrying to \u201cskim the cream\u201d away from Fannie. We could choose to accept or\nrefuse mortgages with weaker risk. We could require more or less documentation\nfrom lenders. We could be lenient or stringent when mortgages defaulted early\n(being stringent required the lender to repurchase the mortgage and take the\nloss). We could propose alternative ways to share losses on risky mortgages.\n\nBut we also needed to \u201cmanage the duopoly.\u201d If we aggressively lowered fees,\nFannie could match, and the result would be low profits for each firm. Or if\nwe tolerated riskier mortgages, we ran the risk of suffering losses later.\nWhile I was at Freddie, our CEO, Leland Brendsel, put a stop to a competition\nto offer \u201clow-doc\u201d loans, in which borrowers were not required to prove that\nthey had the income and job stability needed to be able to repay a mortgage.\nAbout 15 years later, Brendsel was gone (so was I), and another \u201clow-doc\u201d\ncompetition broke out. This time, nobody stopped it, and the country\nexperienced the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 mostly caused by the\nproliferation of NINJA (\u201cno verification of Income, Job, or Assets\u201d) loans.\n\nWith imperfect competition, there are many firms offering products that are\nsimilar, but not identical. Think of all of the restaurants in your area. They\nhave multidimensional strategic choices. They can compete on price. They can\nchange their menu selections. They can compete on the basis of location. They\ncan compete on decor and atmosphere. They can offer daily specials. They can\noffer senior discounts. They can use different methods of advertising. They\ncan provide entertainment. They can offer customer convenience, by allowing\nonline orders. And so on. All of that is ignored in the textbook model that\nfocuses solely on the decision of how much to produce.\n\n####\n\nPrice Discrimination Strategy\n\nEconomists also under-rate the significance of fixed costs. See The Marginal\nRevolution is Dead.\n\n> In the twenty-first century, marginalism does not apply to pricing or to\n> wage-setting. To understand the contemporary economy, we have to think in\n> terms of overhead. Real-world business is often dominated by overhead.\n\nI have a catch-phrase Price Discrimination Explains Everything. Why do\ngroceries offer coupons? Price discrimination. Why do airlines offer discounts\nfor advance purchases and for stand-by passengers? Price discrimination. Why\ndo cell phone providers offer different plans? Price discrimination.\n\nThe goal of all these tactics is to bring in more revenue in order to help\ncover overhead. Price discrimination means finding a way to charge more to\ncustomers who would rather just pay a higher price than go to a lot of effort\nto get something cheaper. Meanwhile, the business looks for a way to sneak in\ndiscounts to customers who are more discretionary about when and where they\nbuy.\n\n####\n\nCorporate Soap Opera\n\nEconomists treat \u201cthe firm\u201d as if it were a single, cohesive unit. In 2016,\nBengt Holmstrom and Oliver Hart won a Nobel Prize for undertaking analysis of\njust one internal conflict\u2014that between a manager wanting performance and a\nworker preferring to shirk. But in the real world, a business is a cauldron of\nconflicts.\n\nEven the best economists assume that there is a stable relationship between\nincentives and outcomes, so that there is a single optimal \u201cincentive\ncompatible\u201d compensation system. But in fact employees learn over time how to\nhack compensation systems. As a result, compensation systems always degrade\nover time. No system is ever optimal to begin with, and every system weakens\nas employees discover how to game it. The important thing about compensation\nsystems is to change them with the right frequency. Change them too often and\nthe expenses of training and implementation are excessive. Keep them in place\ntoo long and the incentives degrade too much.\n\nMore important, if you look inside a real-world business, especially a large\norganization, what you see are all sorts of personality conflicts, inter-group\nrivalries, strange embedded behaviors, and so on. I call this Corporate Soap\nOpera.\n\nOne day, a senior VP at Freddie Mac had me in his office and asked me if there\nwere any shortcuts to implementing my pet idea, which was to use statistical\npattern-matching to underwrite mortgage loans more accurately at less cost. I\nthought for a moment, went to his whiteboard, and drew a matrix of down\npayments and credit scores. Thus was Freddie Mac\u2019s automated underwriting\nsystem born.\n\nShortly afterward, I was quitting Freddie. My supervisor (not the senior VP)\nhad demoted me without even informing me. Corporate Soap Opera.\n\nThe key innovation that made Large Language Models like ChatGPT possible was\ninvented at Google. But the engineers who developed this technique, which they\ncalled the Transformer, left the firm. That smells to me like Corporate Soap\nOpera. Obviously, the conflict a few months ago between Sam Altman and his\nBoard was Corporate Soap Opera.\n\nIf you interview anyone who works in a large organization, I will bet you will\nfind that the person has people he considers enemies. In his view, they cause\nharm to him and to the firm overall. Corporate Soap Opera.\n\nI sometimes think that workers in organizations reproduce family dysfunction\nat work. Their competitions for pay and status are like sibling rivalries.\nThey resent bosses the way children resent parents. Their pursuit of positions\nin other parts of the organization can feel like marital infidelity. Corporate\nSoap Opera.\n\nRecently, Robin Hanson wrote,\n\n> A firm\u2019s tangible assets include buildings, machines, contracts, and\n> inventory. But for firms in the S&P 500, only 10 percent of firm value, on\n> average, is accounted for by such assets. ...\n>\n> firms are complex social systems.

The usual life history of a firm\u2019s culture is that, after some\n> initial improvement, it will tend to drift, accumulating dysfunction, until\n> the firm ceases to be worth saving and dies.\n\nGood cultures minimize the cost of corporate soap opera. For example, Freddie\nMac tried to inculcate the principle \u201cassume positive motivation.\u201d That is,\nrather than assume that the person from finance is trying to undermine the\nsales rep, assume that the finance person has a positive motivation to do cost\naccounting correctly.\n\nAnother example of corporate culture is Amazon\u2019s \u201ctwo pizza teams\u201d approach to\nprojects. A project team is kept small and integrates with the rest of the\ncompany via software interfaces rather than using the meetings and discussions\nfavored by bureaucratic organizations.\n\nWhen I had a web business that I ran myself and merged with another small\nfirm, their culture included something that they called \u201cthe integrity\nagreement.\u201d This meant that if another partner did something that bothered\nyou, rather than letting your resentment fester you would schedule a meeting\nwith that partner, with another partner present to act as neutral. Then you\nand the partner who had bothered you would hash out the problem.\n\nWhether these cultural elements work or not, their intent is to minimize the\ndamage that otherwise might come from Corporate Soap Opera. As Hanson points\nout, cultural norms contribute significantly to the overall value of a modern\nfirms.\n\nBut all corporate cultures are flawed in some way. I like to say that anyone\nwho is afraid of competing with a big corporation has never been inside one.\n\n####\n\nConclusion\n\nMany people see businesses as inherently rich and all-powerful. Taking an\neconomics class can help you to see past this naive view. But the only way to\nreally understand real-world firms is to work for them.\n\nShare\n\n26 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n2 Restacks\n\n26\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Do Economists Understand Business?\n\narnoldkling.substack.com\n\n20\n\nShare\n\n20 Comments\n\nTom Kirkendall6 hrs agoMilton Friedman observed the following about economists\ngiving investment advice.

Students are buying a peer group. Admissions officers are\n\"composing a class\" on paper -- a conceit that students-as-inputs are\ncomplements to one another -- but the target interaction and integration are\nhard to engineer in reality.The business strategies are puzzling insofar as\nthere is little product differentiation. Branding is important for marketing,\nbut selective colleges are mostly alike. Similar curricula (with a few niche\nexceptions). A semester abroad. Total institution (residential campus with\ncommunal residence and meals, athletics, clubs). Four years. Very similar\nsticker prices (even for out-of-state students at flagship public\nuniversities) despite vast variance in endowments. Similar price\ndiscrimination (patterns of financial aid). True, there are notable\ndifferences in org size (large public universities vs small liberal-arts\ncolleges).Are business models (supply) similar across colleges because that is\nwhat students want (demand)? Are the prevalent similarities driven by\naccreditation regs? Are they a side-effect of the peculiar institution,\ntenure? Or etc?I will be grateful for any insights Arnold or readers might\nhave.PS: Re: \"the corporate soap opera.\" There is an old saw: Fights in\nacademe are vicious because the stakes are low.Expand full commentLike\n(5)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n2 replies\n\n18 more comments...\n\nThe Strategy of Dating Short Men\n\nWhy don't more women use it?\n\nSep 24, 2023 \u2022\n\nArnold Kling\n\n50\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Strategy of Dating Short Men\n\narnoldkling.substack.com\n\n111\n\nI Condemn. . .But\n\nThe worst form of evil\n\nOct 14, 2023 \u2022\n\nArnold Kling\n\n99\n\nShare this post\n\n#### I Condemn. . .But\n\narnoldkling.substack.com\n\n80\n\nAssimilating Women into Male Institutions\n\nWe have not done it well\n\nMay 10, 2023 \u2022\n\nArnold Kling\n\n64\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Assimilating Women into Male Institutions\n\narnoldkling.substack.com\n\n61\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Arnold Kling\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
