During the\npandemic, the sector boomed as digital networking and communication became an\neven more essential part of how humans across the world interacted\u2014leading to\na frenzy of growth and hiring activity. However, the industry has been dogged\nby significant obstacles since then. With monetary policy tightening, the\nsurge in online activity caused by the pandemic fading, macroeconomic\nuncertainty rising, and key tech financial institutions failing, late-2022 saw\nthe beginning of the so-called \u201ctech-cession,\u201d exemplified by layoffs at high-\nprofile companies like Amazon, Google, and Meta.\n\nYet the US has not actually seen tech employment drop during the tech-\ncession\u2014rather, net job growth in the sector has slowed to a complete crawl\nthroughout 2023 after two years of extremely rapid gains. US tech employers\nadded 308k total jobs in 2021, 180k in 2022, and a mere 32k last year.\nAlthough some subsectors saw outright payroll declines, much of the industry\u2019s\nslowdown was born by workers as reduced hiring and compensation rather than\ndrops in employment.\n\nNevertheless, many of the tech industry\u2019s traditional hubs have indeed\nsuffered significantly since the onset of the tech-cession\u2014and nowhere more so\nthan California. As the home of Silicon Valley, the state represented roughly\n30% of total US tech sector output and got roughly 10% of its statewide GDP\nfrom the tech industry in 2021. However, the Golden State has been bleeding\ntech jobs over the last year and a half\u2014since August 2022, California has lost\n21k jobs in computer systems design & related, 15k in streaming & social\nnetworks, 11k in software publishing, and 7k in web search & related\u2014while\ngaining less than 1k in computing infrastructure & data processing. Since the\nbeginning of COVID, California has added a sum total of only 6k jobs in the\ntech industry\u2014compared to roughly 570k across the rest of the United States.\n\nAs a result, the share of US tech jobs located in California has fallen\nsignificantly since 2020, dropping a full percentage point over the last year\nand hitting the lowest levels in more than a decade. California had gone from\nhaving less than 15% of all US tech industry jobs in 2010 to nearly 19% in\nlate 2019, but the pandemic immediately reversed that trend. In early COVID\nCalifornia losing ground as a share of the total US tech sector wasn\u2019t an\nextreme problem though\u2014the whole industry was expanding so rapidly that the\nstate was still adding tech jobs at a robust rate. In 2021 San Francisco and\nSan Jose saw their real GDP jump by 11% and 13.5%, respectively, even as they\nwere becoming a smaller share of overall tech employment.\n\nYet throughout 2022, California went from holding a smaller slice of a growing\npie to seeing outright declines in its tech sector, and as a result, many of\nthe states\u2019 tech hubs have still not seen their job markets fully recover from\nthe pandemic. The San Francisco metro area has lost 54k jobs since 2020, the\nlargest drop of any major American city, Los Angeles has lost the second-most\njobs at 38k, and San Jose is still down 6k. In fact, the San Francisco and San\nJose metro areas continued losing jobs over the last year, joining a small\nclub of major cities with shrinking workforces alongside Portland, Memphis,\nMilwaukee, and Detroit. Vacant office buildings in downtown SF, once a rarity,\nare now increasingly common. For California, the loss of tech jobs represents\na major drag on the state\u2019s economy, a driver of acute budgetary problems, and\nan upending of housing market dynamics\u2014but most importantly, it represents a\nsquandering of many of the opportunities the industry afforded the state\nthroughout the 2010s.\n\n##\n\nCalifornia and the Tech-cession\n\nThe extent of the job losses in California\u2019s tech sector wasn\u2019t fully apparent\nuntil the recent release of new official data on state-level job growth. Every\nyear, the Bureau of Labor Statistics revises its regional jobs data using more\ncomprehensive information sources as part of its regular data benchmarking\nprocesses\u2014yet this year\u2019s revisions to state-level payroll data were\nespecially pronounced in California. Old numbers saw the state add 814k jobs\nfrom the start of 2022 to the end of 2023, but revised numbers reduced that\nfigure by 247k. That was the single-largest gross downward revision of any\nstate, and the third-largest downward revision as a percent of total payrolls\n(behind only Massachusetts and DC).\n\nThe downward revisions to California job growth were also even more pronounced\nin tech-related industries. Most tech jobs\u2014like software publishing, web\nhosting, computing infrastructure, data processing, streaming, and social\nmedia\u2014fall under the greater umbrella of the \u201cinformation\u201d sector, while a\ncouple other subsectors\u2014like computer systems design and custom computer\nprogramming\u2014fall under professional & business services. In those information\nand professional/business services sectors that encompass tech-related\nemployment, California job growth was originally estimated at 28k but revised\ndownward by 156k. Payrolls were revised down by 11.6% in computing\ninfrastructure & data processing, 9.5% in web search portals & related, and\n5.1% in computer systems design & related.\n\nThose revisions solidified the fact that California was losing ground as a\nshare of US employment across wide swathes of the tech industry. At best, the\nstate remains at roughly its pre-pandemic share of nationwide employment in\nsome subsectors like computing infrastructure, streaming services, and social\nnetworks. However, California\u2019s share of jobs in other subsectors like\nsoftware publishing and computer system design has fallen to some of the\nlowest levels on record\u2014and in web search, it has fallen to the lowest level\nin more than a decade.\n\nThe drop in California tech employment over the last year has been especially\npronounced within Silicon Valley\u2014the San Francisco metro area has lost 16,100\njobs in the information sector over the last year, while the San Jose metro\narea has lost 7,700. In percentage terms, those are the largest drops in\ninformation employment that the Bay Area has experienced since the dot-com\nbust and the 2001 recession. Outside of the information sector, both the San\nFrancisco and San Jose metro areas added a small number of jobs over the last\nyear, but the loss of tech jobs was enough to more than completely offset job\ngrowth across other parts of the economy.\n\nThat still leaves an obvious question: where are California tech jobs going?\nRight now, that\u2019s hard to answer with a high degree of precision\u2014full 2023\ndetailed state-level jobs data has yet to be released, and many tech\nsubsectors\u2019 data was broken by a change in industry classifications in 2022.\nHowever, we can get a general idea by looking at the overall information\nsector and then excluding sub-industries like movies and telecoms. By this\nmetric, Texas added 25k info tech jobs from the start of the pandemic to Q3\n2023 while Washington state added 22k and Florida added 20k. Meanwhile,\nCalifornia added only 16k and New York added only 14k. In percentage terms,\nthat means Florida\u2019s info tech payrolls grew 27%, Texas\u2019 grew 24%,\nWashington\u2019s grew 18%, New York\u2019s grew 8%, and California\u2019s grew a meager 5%.\nOther states with notable info tech job growth include New Jersey (+11k,\n+28%), Tennesse (+10k, +43%), North Carolina (+9k, +19%), Georgia (+8k, +14%),\nand Pennsylvania (+8k, +15%).\n\nUsing longitudinal Census data on net interstate job-to-job transitions in the\ninformation sector, we can also get an idea of where California tech workers\nspecifically are moving, rather than just which states are adding the most\ntech jobs. Since the start of the pandemic, Texas has been the single-largest\ndestination for net outmigration of California information-sector workers,\nfollowed by Washington, New York, and then Oregon\u2014with Nevada, Tennesse,\nColorado, Arizona, and Florida also meriting honorable mention. The raw amount\nof outmigration peaked in mid-2022 and has decelerated since the start of the\ntech-cession\u2014yet this reflects the large nationwide decrease in tech hiring\nand job churn rather than California stabilizing its employment share in the\nindustry.\n\n###\n\nWhat it Means for the Golden State\n\nWhat has the loss of so many tech jobs meant for California? First, there was\na broad economic slowdown\u2014the state\u2019s GDP fell 2.1% through 2022, the second-\nbiggest drop of any state over that period, driven by a massive deceleration\nacross the information sector. That allowed states like Texas to overtake\nCalifornia in the post-pandemic GDP recovery, creating a gap that California\nstill hasn\u2019t been able to close despite its economic rebound in 2023.\n\nShifts in tech jobs out of the Bay Area and California broadly have also\nsignificantly impacted the state\u2019s housing market. Rent price growth in San\nFrancisco (and Los Angeles) tended to be much higher than the national average\nthroughout the latter half of the 2010s, but has come in well below the\nnational average since the start of the pandemic as remote work enabled many\nto move for cheaper housing elsewhere in the US. SF-area rent prices have also\ncooled significantly over the last year as the region lost tech jobs,\nincreasing by more than three percentage points less than the national\naverage. These shifts have affected home prices, too\u2014by Zillow\u2019s estimate,\nhome values within the city of San Francisco proper are at their lowest levels\nsince 2017, down more than 17% from their mid-2022 peaks, while California\nstatewide home price growth has trailed the national average since mid-2022,\nfalling 0.5% while nationwide prices grew 2.5%.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, California losing tech jobs also significantly hurts\nthe state\u2019s public finances, which have grown heavily dependent on Silicon\nValley. Witholdings on regular equity compensation at major publicly traded\ntech companies were responsible for 7% of the state\u2019s total income tax\nrevenues in 2021, and that\u2019s before discussing the volatile initial public\nofferings that can each put billions into the state\u2019s coffers. California\u2019s\ncalendar-year income tax revenues dropped $34B between 2022 and 2023 As the\ntech-cession has raged, with corporate net income tax revenues also falling\n$13B. Facing significant consecutive annual budget deficits this year,\nCalifornia has had to tap into its financial reserves while cutting or\ndelaying various state spending projects on infrastructure, education,\nhealthcare, and climate. In the short term, the state can hope for a further\nrebound in tech and a reopening of the IPO window, but to the extent the US\ntech industry is now structurally less concentrated in California it will mean\nless future potential revenue\u2014forcing the state to raise tax rates or pare\nback spending on investment, social services, and more.\n\n###\n\nConclusions\n\nHowever, California may indeed have some short-term tech rebound to look\nforward to, as much of the US tech sector has now moved past the slowdown of\n2022. Revenue growth among computing infrastructure providers & data\nprocessors, software publishers, computer systems designers, and web search\nportals have all recovered from their post-pandemic lows.\n\nPhysical investment within the tech industry is also skyrocketing to keep up\nwith increasing demands for computing power, especially those of the booming\nartificial intelligence industry. The net property, plant, and equipment held\nby US information technology firms has shot up by more than $70B over the last\nyear, a dramatic acceleration that was by far the largest increase on record.\nAll of that has put some more life into Cali\u2019s tech industry\u2014in a highly\nsymbolic victory, OpenAI recently signed the largest post-pandemic downtown\nSan Francisco office lease, surpassing the size of a lease signed just months\nearlier by competing AI firm Anthropic. California income tax withholdings\nposted strong gains in February and March and are now running slightly ahead\nof expectations despite trailing budget projections at the very start of the\nyear, propelled forward by strong stock performance at companies like NVIDIA,\nMeta, and more.\n\nIndeed, despite losing significant amounts of tech jobs to other states,\nCalifornia still retains a massive advantage at the high end of the\nindustry\u2014while making up only 18% of nationwide employment in the information\nsector, Californians receive a whopping 31% of the industry\u2019s total\ncompensation. In 2022, the average Californian in the software publishing\nindustry took home $247k including stock options and bonuses, while the\naverage non-Californian earned only $176k. Those dynamics are a central part\nof how cumulative GDP growth in California has been 9.9% since the start of\nCOVID, ahead of the nationwide average of 8.9%, despite job growth in the\nGolden State being 1.8% against a US average of 3.8% over the same period.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s long-standing problem is not that its economy is failing or lacks\ndynamism\u2014rather, it\u2019s that the state refuses to accommodate everyone in its\neconomic success. Opportunity hoarding, particularly via exclusionary\nrestrictions on housing construction designed to protect the value of\nhomeowner\u2019s properties, places harsh limits on how many jobs California can\nadd regardless of how much the state\u2019s economy grows. The pandemic remote work\nboom was the first time when the kind of well-educated high-income workers who\ncompose the backbone of the tech industry left California in large numbers,\nbut rising housing costs were already driving low and middle-income residents\nout of California for decades beforehand.\n\nTexas has built half a million more homes than California since the start of\nthe pandemic, and metro Austin has built 100k more homes than the entire Bay\nArea despite being a fraction of the size. Should it be any wonder, then, why\nCalifornia is losing tech jobs to Texas?\n\nAttempts at opportunity hoarding have now led to opportunity loss\u2014San\nFrancisco will never be able to go back and allow the housing units that were\nso ravenously in demand when the city\u2019s downtown and its tech industry were at\nthe zenith of its power, making it just that much harder for the still-\nextremely-expensive-city to compete for startups and tech talent going\nforward. For California, policy failures have significantly weakened the\nstate\u2019s grip on the world\u2019s most valuable industry cluster\u2014perhaps\npermanently.\n\nThanks for reading!
