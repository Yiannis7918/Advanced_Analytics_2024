But the community fought back.\n\nPlaya Carrizalillo is one of the beaches in Puerto Escondido, Mexico [Nick\nHilden/Al Jazeera]\n\nBy Nick Hilden\n\nPublished On 6 Apr 20246 Apr 2024\n\nSave articles to read later and create your own reading list.\n\nPuerto Escondido, Mexico \u2013 With its bucolic beaches, lush greenery and\nkaleidoscopic sunsets, it is not difficult to see why the remote tropical\nparadise of Puerto Escondido has become so popular.\n\nThe coastline, tucked away on the southern Pacific hip of Mexico\u2019s Oaxaca\nregion, is a mecca for surfers, bar hoppers and bohemian beach bums. Wildlife\nabounds, with pelicans perched on rocky outcroppings, buzzards gliding\noverhead, turtles and dolphins making appearances at sea and random iguanas\nscurrying about.\n\n## Keep reading\n\nlist of 4 items\n\nlist 1 of 4\n\n### Old ways survive in Bali despite mass tourism, but for how long?\n\nlist 2 of 4\n\n### In Mexico, a community gathers to celebrate a quincea\u00f1era \u2014 for the\nelderly\n\nlist 3 of 4\n\n### Photos: Bullfighting resumes in Mexico City\n\nlist 4 of 4\n\n### Photos: Mexico\u2019s weed \u2018nuns\u2019 taking the plant back from the narcos\n\nend of list\n\nBut because so many are choosing to experience this beach oasis, the town\nfaces a problem that plagues similar destinations around the world: the rising\ntide of tourism and a lack of preparation for it.\n\nA decade ago, Puerto Escondido was a rather unassuming place largely off the\ninternational radar, save for a smattering of retirees from North America and\nsurfers from Europe and Australia. But around that time, a flurry of articles\ndrew an abundance of attention to this secluded Shangri-la due to a\ncombination of word of mouth driven largely by the rising influence of\nInstagram and a boom of tourism across Mexico in general.\n\nSince then, the impact of the town\u2019s growing reputation has become starkly\napparent.\n\nIn March 2020, many people flocked to Puerto Escondido to wait out the COVID\npandemic. The small town swelled with Mexicans escaping the density of Mexico\nCity and people from all over the world fleeing strict COVID restrictions in\ntheir countries in favour of Mexico\u2019s more lax approach \u2013 borders remained\nopen for the duration of the pandemic, while business closures and lockdowns\nwere relatively brief and inconsistently enforced \u2013 and the tranquil shores of\nOaxaca.\n\nThis influx of temporary residents was a turning point for Puerto Escondido.\nConstruction exploded: hotels, restaurants, bars, dubious dance clubs \u2013 the\nworks. The economic dominance of the so-called \u201cdigital nomads\u201d skyrocketed\nrental prices and the cost of living climbed.\n\nBefore long, the community was struggling to keep up in the face of unchecked\ntourism and development.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s grown a little too much\u201d for its own good,\u201d says local graphic artist\nOrlando Salinas, who grew up visiting Puerto Escondido with his family before\nmoving there in 2017 and has since become involved with various community\ngroups. Salinas notes that while the fast flow of tourism has had economic\nbenefits for those in the industry, \u201calmost every other aspect is being\nnegatively affected\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn the last five years, Puerto has experienced a growth in unsustainable\ntourism with a lack of proper management and regulation, causing a huge impact\non the environment and local economy,\u201d says Emmett Balassone, the\ncommunications coordinator for the nonprofit Save the Waves, which was formed\nto protect surf ecosystems around the world.\n\n### Sign up for Al Jazeera\n\n#### Americas Coverage Newsletter\n\nprotected by reCAPTCHA\n\nThis situation has resulted in \u201cinadequate wastewater infrastructure, erosion\nissues associated with development and the lack of legal protection for some\nof the critical habitats in the area\u201d.\n\nPlaya Zicatela, Puerto Escondido\u2019s main tourist strip [Nick Hilden/Al Jazeera]\n\n## The community fights back\n\nOver the years, several efforts have coalesced to address these issues and\nrecently, activists scored an important victory in their attempts to reduce\ntourism\u2019s manifold strains.\n\nThe fight involved the area\u2019s last untouched beach \u2013 a wildlife-rich, lagoon-\nnestled cove known as Playa Punta Colorada \u2013 which had fallen into the\ncrosshairs of developers. The struggle to protect it dates back more than a\ndecade and its story is largely at the centre of the community\u2019s advocacy for\nmore sustainable tourist regulation.\n\nThe first threat to Punta Colorada came in 2011 when officials announced the\nconstruction of a dock. Opponents argued this would wreck the adjacent beach,\nlagoon and reef, and organised a group that eventually took the name Salvemos\n(\u201cSave\u201d) Colorada. They prevailed then and when a second attempt to resurrect\nthe dock project reared its head in 2021. But the biggest danger was yet to\ncome.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNew concerns arose in August 2023 when the state government announced a new\ndevelopment project,\u201d explains Salvemos Colorada member Almendra Gomezleyva\nMelchor. The plans included the construction of a shopping centre, a low-\nbudget hotel, a luxury residential area and four all-inclusive hotels.\n\n\u201cThis news once again jeopardised the ecosystem of Punta Colorada,\u201d Melchor\nadds.\n\nAnd as Balassone points out, the negative impact had not only local but also\nwider implications. \u201cPlaya Colorada is one of the last intact coastal\necosystems in this part of Oaxaca and includes mangroves, which are key in\nfighting climate change.\u201d\n\nSalvemos Colorada joined a coalition of groups united in opposition to the\ndevelopment, including Save the Waves, Costa Unida, the Oaxacan Conservation\nFund and SOS Puerto \u2013 the last of which has played an increasingly prominent\nrole in advocating for local tourism and environmental regulations.\n\nControversial construction in the La Punta neighbourhood [Nick Hilden/Al\nJazeera]\n\n## SOS\n\nSOS Puerto formed spontaneously in 2022 when founder Andrea Esquerra noticed a\nnewly-fenced-off area on one of the town\u2019s still-lesser-developed beaches,\nBacocho. While it was already home to a couple of hotels and a beach club,\nthis particular stretch of sand tends to be quieter and frequented by locals\nrather than rowdy tourists. The foreigners who do visit typically come to\nparticipate in the baby turtle release program; the lush, sylvan space between\nBacocho and Colorada is home to turtles, crocodiles and many other species.\n\nThis area was being threatened by a planned construction of an 80-unit luxury\napartment building. At a meeting to discuss the complex, which was held by the\nState Water Commission and attended by the municipal president and\ncouncillors, Esquerra questioned the project. This drew support from other\nattendees who named her as the representative of Bacocho, Colorada and another\nadjacent beach, Coral.\n\n\u201cDays later, they began to remove sand with trucks,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI went and\ntried to stop the trucks while sending messages for help on my Whatsapp\ngroups, then more citizens began to arrive and we closed the street for four\ndays.\u201d\n\nBlocking streets and highways has been a common tactic among various protest\ngroups in the region, with varying success. In this case, it worked. The\nproject was cancelled, and as a result, SOS Puerto became a recognised voice\nfor the community. Today, it has roughly 14,000 followers on Instagram \u2013\nimpressive numbers considering the town\u2019s population is three times that\nnumber.\n\nSOS has earned popular support among residents, says the local artist Salinas,\nbecause \u201cthey\u2019ve been hitting a lot of the goals that they\u2019ve set for\nthemselves. Especially lately\u201d.\n\nThe green space between Playa Bacocho and Playa Colorada is home to turtles,\ncrocodiles and many other species [Nick Hilden/Al Jazeera]\n\n## A new threat\n\nThat \u201clately\u201d refers to the most recent threat to loom over Punta Colorada \u2013\nthe aforementioned shopping centre and hotels. Once again, organisations\nopposed to development joined forces to save the beach.\n\n\u201cThis ecosystem is crucial,\u201d explains Melchor, \u201cbecause \u2013 besides having one\nof the most significant waves for bodyboarding \u2013 it hosts a wetland with white\nand red mangroves, protected species such as the leatherback turtle and\ncrocodiles, various species of migratory birds, mammals, reefs and even\ngeological remnants.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the proposed complex would shut down public beach access,\ndepriving the residents of the last pristine beach in Puerto Escondido.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAccess to that beach,\u201d says Esquerra, \u201cwould be totally privatised by the\nlarge hotel chains\u201d.\n\nTo make matters worse, it was discovered that a water treatment plant next to\nthe beach was overflowing due to inadequate tourist infrastructure and that\nwastewater was pouring directly into the ocean. So the coalition\u2019s efforts\nbecame threefold: to improve sanitation, prevent the privatisation of beaches\nand stave off the alteration of the ecosystem.\n\nThis struggle went from the streets to the courts, starting with peaceful\ndemonstrations, an online petition and requests for meetings with the governor\nand other political figures \u2013 to no avail.\n\n\u201cSeeing that the government persisted in its plan to develop Punta Colorada,\u201d\nsays Melchor, \u201cwe took legal action and initiated a collective protective\nlawsuit, claiming our right to a healthy environment\u201d.\n\nThe groups gathered some 300 signatures, which were enough to convince a judge\nto suspend the construction permits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor now, that area cannot be sold or privatised,\u201d says Esquerra.\n\nBut while this victory is promising, the fight isn\u2019t over yet: The judge\u2019s\norder is only temporary.\n\n\u201cWe are still in the trial process awaiting the verdict,\u201d says Melchor,\nexplaining that the coalition is going over conservation proposals with the\nministries of environment and tourism. \u201cWe are hopeful that the government\nwill listen and understand the importance of preserving Punta Colorada.\u201d\n\nAdvocates of the Colorada complex \u2013 including officials from the state and\nmunicipality \u2013 did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nLong-abandoned construction looming over the Zicatela tourist strip [Nick\nHilden/Al Jazeera]\n\n## The big question\n\nThe fight over Colorada implies a broader question: How will Puerto Escondido\nreact in the face of its rapid tourist influx?\n\nEsquerra emphasises that the coalition is not against tourism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOur fight is against inequality and the lack of investment and planning in\nthe face of growth,\u201d she says, \u201cwhich leaves both locals and tourists\nunprotected. A strong investment in infrastructure is needed to sustain growth\nand to guarantee access to clean water, beaches and seas free of wastewater,\ntransportation and health and safety.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince the pandemic,\u201d says Melchor, \u201cthe growth of Puerto Escondido has been\nexponential. However, this is not reflected in infrastructure improvement\u201d.\n\nAs a result, she adds, the town has experienced wastewater spills, power\noutages, water shortages and increasing traffic issues, as well as \u201cnew social\nproblems such as gentrification, displacement, and dispossession\u201d caused by\nthe rapid increase in housing prices and cost of living.\n\nSo what can Puerto Escondido do to address these matters?\n\nMelchor says that among the various solutions proposed, key factors involve\ninvestment in basic service infrastructure like drainage systems and treatment\nplants, as well as the regulation of construction, housing density and\nvacation rentals to ensure that money stays in the region and that taxes will\nbe collected for reinvestment in the community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProponents of these actions argue they will not only protect the town but\nsecure its status as a thriving tourist destination.\n\n\u201cThe area will continue to grow,\u201d notes Balassone, \u201cso adopting these changes\nnow will ensure that Puerto keeps the natural treasures that have drawn\nsurfers and visitors from around the world in the first place\u201d.\n\nPlaya Carrizalillo is one of several beaches in Puerto Escondido [Nick\nHilden/Al Jazeera]\n\n## A global consideration\n\nPuerto Escondido is not alone in its struggle to confront surging tourism.\nResidents of destinations around the world \u2013 from Thailand\u2019s Chiang Mai to\nColombia\u2019s Medellin, Bali to Barbados, Portugal\u2019s Lisbon to Vietnam\u2019s Hoi An \u2013\nare facing similar issues. And it is only going to become more pressing as the\nnumber of travellers and location-independent workers continues to climb.\n\nAccording to those fighting in Puerto Escondido, solutions arise from\ndedicated community organisations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing a good job of cultivating a solid community,\u201d says Salinas.\n\u201cAlmost everybody is involved in some sort of social project.\u201d\n\n\u201cChange happens when communities unite at the grassroots level,\u201d agrees\nBalassone, \u201cand develop a long-term vision for the place that they love and a\nstrategy for long-term protection\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf the residents of similarly afflicted destinations should learn anything\nfrom the case of Puerto Escondido, these activists advise the prioritisation\nof people over profits.\n\n\u201cPuerto Escondido\u2019s struggle can inspire other cities to unite and work as a\ncommunity,\u201d says Melchor. \u201cI think we are an example that working together can\nachieve things that might seem impossible at first, such as stopping large\nconstructions or billion-dollar developments.\u201d\n\nIt all comes down to collective action.\n\n\u201cThe unity of citizens is very important,\u201d Esquerra affirms. \u201cPower lies with\nthe people and we are the ones who decide what we want for our cities and\ndestinations. It is important to get involved and inform yourself, and to\nraise your voice when the interests of a few pass over the needs of the\npeople.\u201d\n\nSource: Al Jazeera\n\n  *     * About Us\n    * Code of Ethics\n    * Terms and Conditions\n    * EU/EEA Regulatory Notice\n    * Privacy Policy\n    * Cookie Policy\n    * Cookie PreferencesManage preferences\n    * Sitemap\n    * Work for us\n    * HR Quality\n\n  *     * Contact Us\n    * User Accounts Help\n    * Advertise with us\n    * Apps\n    * Newsletters\n    * Channel Finder\n    * TV Schedule\n    * Podcasts\n    * Submit a Tip\n\n  *     * Al Jazeera Arabic\n    * Al Jazeera English\n    * Al Jazeera Investigative Unit\n    * Al Jazeera Mubasher\n    * Al Jazeera Documentary\n    * Al Jazeera Balkans\n    * AJ+\n\n  *     * Al Jazeera Centre for Studies\n    * Al Jazeera Media Institute\n    * Learn Arabic\n    * Al Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human Rights\n    * Al Jazeera Forum\n    * Al Jazeera Hotel Partners\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:\n\n\u00a9 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\n## You rely on Al Jazeera for truth and transparency\n\nWe and our 816 partners store and access information on your device, such as\nunique IDs in cookies to process personal data.
