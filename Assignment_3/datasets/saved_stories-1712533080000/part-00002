The move, along with the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, have helped spike the\nprice of the precious metal to new highs.\n\nhttps://p.dw.com/p/4eQ0C\n\nCopy link\n\nChina has led other reserve banks in buying gold over the past two yearsImage:\nChris Clor/Blend Images/picture alliance\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe price of gold broke the $2,300 (\u20ac2,212) level for the first time this week\nas geopolitical issues, expectations of US interest rate cuts and China's\naccumulation of the precious metal spurred interest from speculators.\n\nGold is seen by investors as a safe haven in times of turmoil and a hedge\nagainst currency devaluation, so the conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine\nhave helped the recent price rise, along with the post-COVID inflation spike.\n\nThe move by China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBC), has been\nmirrored by other mostly emerging market central banks, who are all keen to up\ntheir gold holdings.\n\nDW takes a look at why Beijing has gone on a gold-buying spree.\n\n## What\u2019s behind today\u2019s new gold rush?\n\n04:17\n\n## What exactly has China been doing?\n\nThe PBC has been adding to its gold reserves for the past 16 months in a row,\naccording to the World Gold Council. In 2023, the PBC bought more gold than\nall other central banks.\n\nThe industry body calculated China's purchases of the precious metal last year\nat 225 metric tons, roughly a quarter of the 1,037 tons bought by all the\nworld's central banks.\n\nIn January and February alone, the PBC increased its gold reserves by 22 tons,\nKrishan Gopaul, senior analyst EMEA, at the World Gold Council wrote on X,\nformerly known as Twitter.\n\nChina's central bank now holds roughly 2,257 tons of gold in its vaults.\n\nAs well as the PBC, Chinese consumers have been buying gold coins, bars and\njewelry, after their real estate investments, the yuan currency and the\ncountry's stock market dropped in value due to recent economic woes in the\nworld's second-largest economy.\n\n\"From the start of the year, we've seen enormous Chinese retail buying ...\nrecord amounts of buying on the domestic Shanghai Gold Exchange,\" John Reade,\nchief market strategist at the World Gold Council, told Bloomberg TV last\nmonth.\n\nAfter the property crash, Chinese consumers are again dazzled by gold's allure\nas a store of valueImage: CFOTO/picture alliance\n\n## Why is China buying so much gold?\n\nChina is heavily reliant on the US dollar for trade with the rest of the\nworld. As the world's reserve currency, most commodities are priced in dollars\nand more than half the world's trade is conducted using the greenback.\n\nWhile growing to challenge the US's economic dominance over the past 30 years,\nChina has built up huge foreign exchange reserves, mostly in dollars.\n\nBut Beijing fears it has become too reliant on the greenback and is keen to\ndiversify the PBC's reserves.\n\nChina has been gradually reducing its holdings, which have gradually fallen by\na third since 2011 to around $800 billion, according to US data. The drop has\naccelerated since the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe goal of diversification aligns with those of other countries in the BRICS\n(Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) group, whose economies are set\nto dominate the global economy by 2050.\n\nThe BRICS have even mooted the idea of a shared currency in the future, which\ncould potentially challenge the dollar as the world's reserve currency.\n\n## How Xi Jinping\u2019s authoritarianism is killing China\u2019s economy\n\n22:51\n\n## Why does China want to diversify from the dollar?\n\nBRICS nations, including China, are concerned about how Washington weaponizes\nthe dollar to preserve its global economic and geopolitical position.\n\nThe dollar's position allows the US to borrow money at a much lower cost.\nWashington can also use the currency as a diplomacy tool, for example when\nimposing sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea.\n\nFollowing Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the US and European\nUnion imposed several rounds of sanctions on Moscow, including freezing the\nRussian central bank's foreign reserves.\n\nUnder US pressure, most Russian banks were also ejected from the SWIFT payment\nsystem, which facilitates international money transfers.\n\n\"I think it [the sanctions] has made a lot of central banks think carefully\nabout what they hold in their reserves,\" Reade told Bloomberg last month.\n\nChinese leaders are worried that the country could face similar US curbs if it\ndecided to further flex its military muscles or if the trade war with\nWashington worsened.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping has said that his country could retake Taiwan, a\ndemocratically run island Bejing considers its own territory, by force if\nnecessary.\n\nThe World Gold Council analyst expects central bank purchases to continue for\nseveral years, a signal that the diversification is far from over.\n\nEven after nearly 18 months of buying, China's gold reserves account for\nroughly 4% of the PBC's total reserves. That figure is well below the reserve\nthreshold by the central banks of developed countries.\n\nHaving said that, many gold analysts think the price has been overinflated by\nspeculators and that continued demand by central banks like China's may not\nspur prices much higher.\n\nEven so, unlike paper currencies, gold has intrinsic value as it is a rare\ncommodity that is difficult to extract. It also has multiple economic uses, in\nelectronics, dentistry, medical tools, and the defense, aerospace, and\nautomotive sectors.\n\nEdited by: Rob Mudge\n\nSend us your feedback\n\nYour feedback\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSkip next section Explore more\n\n## Explore more\n\n### Chinese subsidies endanger world economy, says US' Yellen\n\n### Chinese subsidies endanger world economy, says US' Yellen\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said that China's subsidy-fueled\n\"overcapacity\" could overload the global market.
