He squinted at the world\nthrough round-framed spectacles. When he removed his broad-brimmed hat, the\nsudden exposure of the baldness beneath added years to his appearance.\n\n\u201cA pudgy little man, with only a vague collar of chestnut hair,\u201d was the\nassessment of James Kilgalen of the International News Service, one of the\njournalists in the courtroom that day. \u201cHe seemed old and tired.\u201d Other\nnewsmen were more charitable in their descriptions. One called him \u201ca meek\nlamb.\u201d Another thought he could pass for a retired stockbroker. Yet another\nfound him \u201cstill alert of mind and fast in repartee.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of the smartest men I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d noted one of the detectives who\nhad hunted him down and arrested him for passing a worthless check. \u201cMight\nhave been a judge, or a doctor,\u201d and he could have \u201cgone far\u201d if he had not\nbeen \u201ctoo lazy to use his mind in the right direction.\u201d\n\nThe man was sixty-eight, born the year before the outbreak of the Civil War.\nHe had been arrested more than a dozen times and had spent years in New York\u2019s\ninfamous Sing Sing prison.\n\nJohn McCarthy \u2013 also known as George C. Parker and William McCloundy \u2013\nlaunched his swindling career by selling shares in the Brooklyn Bridge.\n(Brooklyn Times Union, July 8, 1928)\n\nHis name? That depends. Some knew him as William McCloundy, others as Mr.\nRoberts or Mr. Taylor. When he was posing as the captain of an ocean liner, he\nwent by George C. Parker. He had brazenly signed the name \u201cI.O.U. O\u2019Brien\u201d on\nchecks and gotten away with the ruse. Police officers who remembered the day\nhe walked out of a prison where he was serving time, posing as the man in\ncharge, nicknamed him \u201cThe Warden.\u201d Lately he had been calling himself Albert\nMurch.\n\nThe New York police considered him \u201can aristocrat of crookdom.\u201d In the press,\nhe was crowned the \u201cdean of confidence men\u201d and \u201cthe biggest of the big-time\u201d\nswindlers. The Brooklyn Daily Eagle hailed his signature fraud as \u201cthe epic of\nthe confidence world.\u201d\n\nHis real name appears to have been John McCarthy. And he was the con man who\nsold the Brooklyn Bridge.\n\n* * *\n\nIt was hailed as the Eighth Wonder of the World. The Brooklyn Bridge was \u201cthe\ngreatest work wrought by the hand of man\u201d in the nineteenth century,\nBrooklyn\u2019s Daily Eagle proclaimed on the day it officially opened in May 1883,\na \u201cmonument to human ingenuity, mechanical genius and engineering skill.\u201d It\nwas then the longest suspension bridge in the world, spanning the East River\nto connect Manhattan Island to Brooklyn. The span and roadway approaches\nstretched for more than a mile. The soaring, Gothic-arched stone towers were,\nfor a time, the tallest structures in the Western Hemisphere. It took more\nthan a dozen years to build, at a cost of $16 million \u2013 the equivalent of\nabout $425 million today. It was simply, the New York Tribune asserted, \u201cthe\ngreatest Bridge the world ever saw.\u201d The vaudeville comedians who delighted in\nbashing the city at the eastern end of the bridge, however, remained\nunconvinced. \u201cAll that trouble,\u201d one wisecracked, \u201cjust to get to Brooklyn.\u201d\n\nThe bridge was also a magnet for crime. Allegations of fraud, graft, and\npolitical corruption dogged the massive project during the construction phase.\nOnce it opened, thousands of people crossed on foot every day and crammed the\nwalkways for weekend strolls, offering tempting targets for pickpockets. \u201cThe\nbridge is likely to be a favorite field for the operations of ... the light\nfingered fraternity,\u201d noted one press report. The warning came too late for\nJames Cruikshank, a Long Island man who inspected the bridge soon after it\nopened and was relieved of his gold watch. The bridge had its own police force\nand, in 1885 alone, officers made 228 arrests for offenses ranging from\ndrunkenness and assault to theft and swindling. Even one of the boys hawking\nnewspapers to passersby near the bridge tried to get a piece of the action.\nOne tearfully told a potential customer he needed to sell his stack of papers\nor his parents would beat him when he got home, then absent-mindedly switched\nsob stories and claimed he was an orphan.\n\nA vintage postcard showing pedestrians crossing the Brooklyn Bridge, which\nopened in 1883. (Author Collection)\n\nThe bridge itself was a money-making machine. For many years tolls were\ncollected from everyone who crossed \u2013 ten cents for a horse-drawn wagon, three\ncents for pedestrians and cyclists \u2013 and the pennies added up. Annual revenues\ntopped a half-million dollars by the end of 1884. Despite the bridge\u2019s\ngrandeur and financial prospects, the editor of a Milwaukee paper was\nunimpressed and offered some pointed advice to his readers. \u201cIf anybody comes\naround here selling stock in that bridge,\u201d he warned, \u201cdon\u2019t any of you invest\na dollar.\u201d\n\nSometime in 1885, with the bridge a commercial success,\nMcCloundy/Parker/O\u2019Brien/McCarthy/Murch \u2013 let\u2019s call him McCarthy \u2013 hit upon\nthe idea of selling New York\u2019s newest landmark, or a stake in it, at least.\nThe twenty-five-year-old swindler, in the words of journalist James Kilgalen,\nwas suave, \u201ca \u2018slick\u2019 talker, and a dapper dresser\u201d who found it easy \u201cto\nstrike up acquaintance with gullible strangers.\u201d McCarthy prided himself on\nignoring rubes and preying on bigger fish. He seemed to relish the challenge\nof duping well-heeled victims who should have known better. It was \u201cthe clever\nones that fall,\u201d he once told New York detective Charles Kane.\n\n___________________________________\n\nThis article first appeared in Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine.\n\n___________________________________\n\nMcCarthy was \u201ca smooth, high pressure salesman invariably giving his customers\na good \u2018bargain,\u2019\u201d Kane recalled. To sell his bridge investment scheme, the\ndetective explained, he touted \u201cthe very fine return\u201d to be made from toll\nrevenues \u201cin view of the large amount of traffic involved.\u201d\n\nHis first target was a visitor from Indiana, who was hooked by the sales pitch\nand agreed to McCarthy\u2019s terms: $1,000 cash and $4,000 more to be paid in\nquarterly instalments. The day he handed over the initial $1,000, of course,\nwas the last time he saw McCarthy.\n\nHow many times McCarthy pulled the swindle is unknown. Kilgalen, writing in\n1928, claimed he sold the bridge \u201cover and over\u201d and the Brooklyn Times Union\nreported that his bridge frauds alone netted $50,000. And it\u2019s not clear that\nhe first sold the bridge in 1885 \u2013 the scam does not appear to have attracted\npress coverage at the time, and some later accounts claim he pioneered the\nfraud in 1895 or 1901. If the latter date is correct, he may have stolen the\nidea from Edward Brasso, who was reportedly doing a brisk business of selling\nthe bridge to Italian newcomers as early as 1900.\n\nMcCarthy soon moved on to a new but similar scam, selling lots in New York\u2019s\nCity Hall Park to unwary New Englanders for $25,000. His first conviction for\ngrand larceny, in 1901, earned him two and a half years in Sing Sing. Soon\nafter his release he was convicted of forgery and imprisoned for four more\nyears. He was sent back to Sing Sing in 1911 for theft and passing a worthless\ncheck. Convictions for forgery in 1917 and theft in 1923 put him once again\nbehind bars. After being caught trying to loosen a stone in the wall of his\ncell, he devised an easier way to escape: he got his hands on the warden\u2019s hat\nand coat, confidently exchanged greetings with guards as he passed, and walked\nout of the prison. He was soon recaptured and the caper added six months to\nhis sentence.\n\nNew York police estimated McCarthy reaped as much as a million dollars during\nhis swindling career. His victims, they believed, included prominent people\nwho refused to report their losses, fearing they would be subjected to public\nridicule. And it was easier to separate fools from their money \u201cin the good\nold days,\u201d he lamented as detectives questioned him about his criminal record,\n\u201cbefore the police became so systematic.\u201d\n\nHe seemed unable to pass up a chance to make a quick buck at someone else\u2019s\nexpense. As he awaited his court appearance in 1928, one of his suspected\nvictims was brought to the police station to see if he could identify\nMcCarthy. The man, who had been swindled out of $10,000, did not recognize him\nand, as he left, the incorrigible and ever-optimistic con man sensed an\nopportunity.\n\n\u201cLet me have your card,\u201d he said. \u201cWe may be able to do business some time.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nMcCarthy\u2019s final scam was modest. The bogus check he tried to cash in 1928 was\nfor a measly $150. But when the police picked him up in New Jersey for that\noffense, he was on the verge of a big payday. He was about to sell ten\nbuilding lots in Asbury Park to a realtor for $17,000. McCarthy, of course,\ndid not own the lots.\n\nHis timing could not have been worse. Under a state law introduced in 1926,\nrepeat offenders convicted of a fourth felony received an automatic sentence\nof life in prison. McCarthy\u2019s criminal record put him well over the threshold\nand he was dispatched to his alma mater, Sing Sing, in November 1928. \u201cIt\nlooks like a sad Christmas,\u201d noted one news report. \u201cfor the last of the old\ntime crooks.\u201d He died in prison eight years later.\n\nMcCarthy was sixty-eight in 1928 when his arrest on a minor fraud charge put\nhim in prison for the rest of his life. (Brooklyn Daily Eagle, November 23,\n1928)\n\nThe Detroit Free Press thought there was a lesson in McCarthy\u2019s audacious\nfraud. \u201cCrooks are sent into the world to teach those who want to get rich\nquick that there is no royal road to riches,\u201d the paper editorialized. \u201cThey\nwill go on selling Brooklyn bridges as long as people can be induced to buy\nthem, which looks as if it might be until the end of time.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy\u2019s swindle has become the ultimate con, synonymous with gullibility\nand blind trust. The catchphrase, \u201cif you believe that, I\u2019ve got a bridge to\nsell you\u201d has been around almost as long as the bridge has been standing.\n\nWhen New Yorkers celebrated the bridge\u2019s one hundredth birthday in 1983 with\nparades and fireworks, the structure went on sale for real. Bits of wooden\nwalkway and slivers of cable salvaged during repair work were sold as\nsouvenirs, and ten dollars bought a certificate purporting to be the deed to\nthe bridge, signed by Sid E. Slicker.\n\nOn the eve of the celebrations, New York cab driver Lou Henderson told a\njournalist the iconic bridge ranked with the Statue of Liberty and the Empire\nState Building as a landmark tourists wanted to see.\n\n\u201cBrooklyn Bridge is still the most, the greatest,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of these days\nI\u2019m gonna get lucky and find a buyer.\u201d\n\nShare:\n\n  * Share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)\n  * More\n\n  * Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)\n\nBrooklyn Bridgecon menconfidence artistsDean JobbJohn McCarthyNew Yorktrue\ncrime history\n\n###### Dean Jobb\n\nDean Jobb\u2019s new book A Gentleman and a Thief: The Daring Jewel Heists of a\nJazz Age Rogue tells the incredible true story of Arthur Barry, who charmed\nthe elite of 1920s New York while planning some of the most brazen jewel\nthefts in history.
