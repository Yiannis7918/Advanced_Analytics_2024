My\ncoworkers and I are PR, fundraising, and outreach staff. All of us are brand\nnew due to turnover. Today we received an email from our boss that says:\n\n\u201cWhen we are traveling for work, we try, when possible, to stay at a state\npark \u2014 cabins in the winter, camping \u2018normally\u2019 in the summer since most\ncabins are booked for a week. The state agency responsible for camping fees\nprovides us a waiver so that we stay for free. Print this waiver.\u201d\n\n(By camping \u201cnormally\u201d in summer, she means outdoors in a tent. Although she\nhas a camper and uses that herself when camping).\n\nWe are affiliated with a state environmental agency and although I can\u2019t\nswear, because I haven\u2019t looked into it, I don\u2019t believe the governor requires\nstate employees on travel to camp.\n\nI know at least one of my new coworkers feels as I do \u2014 we\u2019re not going to\ncamp alone in a park in a tent.\n\nI can\u2019t believe this. Advice?!?!\n\nP.S. Even if we book a cabin (which have limited availability), we\u2019d have to\ntake bedding, etc. And our boss has previously told us that many of the state\ncabins have bed bug problems.\n\nWhat.\n\nNoooo.\n\nIt\u2019s absolutely not reasonable to expect people traveling for work to camp\nrather than having standard business lodgings.\n\nI get that you\u2019re an environmental group. It\u2019s still not reasonable.\n\nYou need to show up for business meetings rested, washed, and productive \u2014\nwhich an awful lot of people would not be after sleeping in a tent.\n\nEven plenty of experienced campers wouldn\u2019t want to camp the night before work\nmeetings. And beyond that, plenty of people \u2014 including even some\nenvironmentalists \u2014 don\u2019t like camping. Or they want to do it once a year,\nwith friends. And alcohol.\n\nAnd then there are people with medical needs that make camping impractical or\nimpossible.\n\nThis would be bad enough if it were some once-a-year, misguided team-building\nevent for your whole staff. But as your routine lodgings for regular business\ntrips?! It\u2019s wildly unreasonable and out of sync with any business norm.\n\nIf your boss enjoys doing camping on business travel herself, that\u2019s fine. But\nit\u2019s not okay for her to impose it on others.\n\nIf the organization can\u2019t afford to pay for hotel rooms, then it can\u2019t afford\nto send employees on work trips, period. Just like if it couldn\u2019t afford the\nairfare or train ticket, it wouldn\u2019t be okay to suggest you hitchhike.\n\nSay this to your boss: \u201cCan you clarify the travel policy? You mentioned\ncamping, but that\u2019s not something I\u2019d be able to do for a business trip. My\nplan is to book affordable hotels instead.\u201d If she holds firm, feel free to\nsay, \u201cIt\u2019s really not an option for me and I\u2019ll need to stay in hotels. I\u2019ll\nof course make sure to choose budget options.\u201d If you want, feel free to say,\n\u201cThere are lots of reasons why people wouldn\u2019t be able to camp \u2014 including\nhealth concerns that people shouldn\u2019t have to disclose in order to get\nstandard business accommodations.\u201d\n\nEven better, get a group of your coworkers to push back and say \u201cno, this\nwon\u2019t work for us.\u201d There\u2019s power in numbers.\n\nTents! It\u2019s ridiculous.\n\nRead an update to this letter here.\n\n##### You may also like:\n\n  * I have to share a hotel room with a coworker who screams in her sleep\n  * I'm too sick to do a volunteer job -- but they're insisting I attend anyway\n  * a 3-day camping trip for work, taking time off after a break-up, and more\n\n{ 729 comments }\n\nPosted in wait, what?!, workplace practices\n\n## { 729 comments... read them below }\n\nCollapse/Expand all threaded comments\n\n  1. bunniferous* January 21, 2020 at 11:04 am\n\nWell, now we know why there was turnover.\n\n\u25bc Collapse 92 replies\n\n    1.

Like how many campsites are that close to\nwhere the meeting is actually happening? Like imagine if your meeting was in a\ncity of any size or with suburbs. You\u2019d probably have to go at least 45\nminutes away to find a campground. So bizarre.\n\n            2. LunaLena* January 21, 2020 at 12:34 pm\n\nPlaying devil\u2019s advocate here, but since it\u2019s a environmental/conservation\nnon-profit, I\u2019m guessing most of their clients ARE state parks or associated\ngroups. And perhaps the group does consulting work with parks to make them\nmore eco-friendly or something, so it makes sense for them to spend a night on\nthe grounds.

Iris Eyes* January 21, 2020 at 12:39 pm\n\nIf all of the business activities are in an outdoor setting and/or at the\nstate parks then I could see especially a case for using the cabins even\nthough most of the one\u2019s I\u2019ve seen don\u2019t have running water. But tent or\nhammock or other forms of camping should at best allowed but I wouldn\u2019t go so\nfar as to recommend.\n\n\u25bc Collapse 1 reply\n\n                1.

Either way, as you\nsay, it should still be an option, not a requirement.\n\nEspecially because apparently the cabins have BEDBUGS! It\u2019s not more\nacceptable to make people stay in a bedbug-infested place just because they\u2019re\ncamping: bedbugs \u2013 unlike mosquitoes, bears, scorpions, and spiders \u2013 are not\nnormal hazards of camping.\n\n\u25bc Collapse 5 replies\n\n                1.

Upon exiting the shower,\nDickinson went to use her hair dryer only to find there was no power. After an\nintense period of yelling and screaming with a frizzy, soaked head, the\npartners told her to simply put her hair in a little poof-ball on the top of\nher head and be done with it.\n\n\u201cI looked like Little Orphan Annie,\u201d Dickinson chortles. Here she was, about\nready to speak to a huge room of hairdressers, all the while having her own\nhair discombobulated in a knotted little poof-ball. Just when it seemed things\ncouldn\u2019t get any worse, she was informed that they\u2019d be making the final part\nof the trip to shore on a small dinghy, because of course there was no money\nto dock the boat. Dickinson sat at the front of the tiny boat and by the time\nthey\u2019d reached shore she was soaked from head to toe, looking like a drowned\npoodle.\n\n\u201cWe pull up to the dock where Bob is standing,\u201d she explains. \u201cHe helps me up\nonto the dock and looks me up and down and says \u2018we don\u2019t have time to fix\nthat.\u2019\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll include the link to full story in a reply.\n\n\u25bc Collapse 1 reply\n\n                1.

If you cheap out on gear, you *will* pay for it\nin at least one of these categories.\n\nOn comfortable tent camping, where I would be expected to give a business\npresentation the next day? I would anticipate all of my gear would cost at\nleast $600, depending on time of year for being outdoors.

Also, after throwing my back out two years ago, I don\u2019t think\nI\u2019d be able to sleep on an inflatable mattress anymore to begin with.

It was never a hard requirement, but we didn\u2019t have\nany money in the budget for hotels. If we wanted to travel, we\u2019d need to make\na choice between camping or staying home. If we could stay in state park\ncabins for free, we absolutely would have!\n\nI\u2019ve also been a state park ranger, and we always stayed in cabins when\ntraveling. LW doesn\u2019t name their state, but every state park\u2019s system is\ndifferent.

We also had connections with other nonprofits\nthat offered \u201cgear libraries\u201d where people without gear can borrow what they\nneed.

A\nbackpacking tent (where you cannot stand up in it and it\u2019s lightweight) can\nrange anywhere from $200 to several thousand dollars. A car camping tent\n(where you can stand up and it is much heavier) can still range from $150 to\naround $1000.\n\nThis does not include a sleeping pad ($100-500), a sleeping bag ($100-1000),\ncooking supplies, camping supplies, etc.\n\nThe other concern is during the summer if there are heat advisories. Usually\ntent camping is not recommended during heat advisories due to the health risk.\nYou could possibly bring that up as well, that it\u2019s a literal health risk to\ntent camp in those situations.\n\nI LOVE camping and backpacking, but I would not want to try that on a work\ntrip.

But to be at the workshop on time looking well enough groomed\nthat people would take me seriously was a challenge (everyone else was either\nstaying in a nice hotel or commuting), and then I wasn\u2019t getting back to the\ncampground until dusk, meaning that it was hard to enjoy cooking and eating. I\ncouldn\u2019t make notes or read for the next day\u2019s session. Also, camp\nhousekeeping is time consuming, and having to strike a whole campsite and pack\nout before attending the last day of the workshop meant that I really didn\u2019t\nget enough sleep.\n\nTerrible idea.\n\n  64. Governmint Condition* January 21, 2020 at 11:38 am\n\nI once met with somebody from an environmental agency who clearly had a\npersonal agenda. She was taking a position on a matter related to both our\nagencies that was quite extreme, and beyond that of her own agency. When it\nbecame impossible to move a project through because of her position, higher-\nups at both agencies became involved and helped correct the situation. (And I\nthink they moved her out of that position.)\n\nBased on that experience, I would first check if the boss\u2019s e-mail is based on\ntheir own position, or if it came from higher up. It will help identify who\nyou can try to push back to, and whether you can expect any success. (If the\nboss is the head of the nonprofit, it may be a lost cause.)\n\n  65.

Even in my last job, in Large Western Square State, state employees\nmight be required to share rooms, but mandatory camping? Never.\n\nI strongly suspect that this is the private madness of the OP\u2019s boss. (No\nwonder she has turnover.)

Anon for this* January 21, 2020 at 11:46 am\n\nMy first thought, as a program manager at a state environmental agency, was:\nWHAT????\n\nNot even \u201cwhat is this NGO doing?\u201d but \u201cwhat is this state agency doing.\u201d\nBecause in our neck of the woods, camping reservations, especially for camper\ncabins, are very sought-after. It\u2019s not only extremely likely the NGO wouldn\u2019t\nbe able to find a space unless they\u2019d booked months in advance for sought-\nafter parks, but the idea that we\u2019d give vouchers and encourage this would NOT\nbe encouraged by the public. If this agency\u2019s campsites are empty enough that\nthis isn\u2019t an issue, man they\u2019ve got other problems. And maybe they do, since\nthey\u2019re apparently okay with providing vouchers to the NGO out of their parks\nrevenue stream, rather than reimbursing for totally normal travel costs. Wow.\n\nWe do have staff who choose to camp out at some parks when we\u2019re doing\nretreats, it\u2019s not unheard-of. It\u2019s their own choice when it happens; most of\nthe rest of us are in more standard lodgings thank you very much. I also know\nNGOs that do field work that require camping\u2013 that\u2019s normal enough. But as a\ntravel standard? No. No. Ten THOUSAND times no.\n\n\u25bc Collapse 5 replies\n\n    1.

Many National and State parks near me book up their\ncampsites very quickly. If this organization was coming out here for a work\nfunction they would not be able to find a campsite if it isn\u2019t during the\nsummer (and 110+ every day...).\n\n    3.

Anon for this* January 21, 2020 at 1:25 pm\n\nWell then I\u2019d REALLY question what that state agency is doing! At least here,\nwe state employees don\u2019t get vouchers for our parks, much less hand them out\nto our NGO partners as perks. It\u2019s both an ethical (no using our positions for\nprivate gain) and a public perception (putting our/our partners desires above\npublic access) issue. But again, many of our state parks are very full\u2013 and\nnot of bedbugs!\n\nIf I had to go with a likely scenario, I\u2019d say the state agency probably\nprovides the vouchers for field work on or near the state land in question,\nand may be unaware the NGO is using it for travel for its operational services\ntypes for general travel. Although if that is the case, it makes the boss\u2019s\nmove even more questionable.\n\n  73. Chris* January 21, 2020 at 11:48 am\n\nJust simply reading the title made my eyes roll. Camping? Seriously, that is\nnot reasonable at all. And as someone who doesn\u2019t like camping, I would have\nbeen heartsick just hearing this. Also, if you camp in a tent, you are\nobviously more likely to have to deal with the hurdles of nature. Bugs, the\nweather, animals \u2013 what if there is a heatwave and you sweat all night in a\ntent and bugs keep pestering you? You wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep well and\nconsequently you wouldn\u2019t be your best the next day when you are at your\nmeeting.\n\nBut yeah, this is ridiculous. If there is a business trip, it needs to AT\nLEAST be in a hotel. Period.\n\n  74. Rebecca* January 21, 2020 at 11:49 am\n\nWhenever I read these weird money saving schemes, I always wonder if the boss\ngets a bonus for not spending it.

The State\nagencies always had a reimbursable rate for hotels/lodging, and if you went\nover that amount you had to justify why and get approval from your manager. Or\njust pay the difference yourself. I once attended a conference at a resort\nwhere the room was a State rate but they tacked on a \u201cresort fee\u201d. I was able\nto justify the extra expense because staying at an offsite hotel would require\nmore than the resort fee in parking costs and mileage driving back and forth\nevery day. My manager approved and everything was covered. So even the State\nwill approve things over the State rate. I would look up whatever the State\nrate is and find hotels comparable to that.

My younger sister used to work for a state\nenvironmental agency for a large mid-western state. Like all states they had a\ntravel limitation within the state. If an event was within 50 miles you could\nnot book overnight accommodations. One year they were HOSTING a statewide\nconference and the location was 49 miles away. The state absolutely refused to\nallow them to book rooms in the conference hotel. So, they all camped at a\nnearby state park. Fortunately, denim and down vests were acceptable\nconference attire, but it was fairly cold. This state was in the northern part\nof the mid-west.

There is a subset of\nenvironmental non-profits (especially those that are very field work-heavy)\nthat have cultures where this would be very normal.\n\nThat said, even then it would not be mandated, would probably be limited to\nrelatively local or in-state events, and definitely would only apply when the\n\u201cmeetings\u201d were collaborative field work (think clearing brush, installing\nboundary line signage, doing prescribed burns, and other very physical labor).\n\n\u25bc Collapse 1 reply\n\n    1.

I recently upgraded from a tent to a little pop up camper and\nwe frequently stay at a state park that is about a half hour out of town. I\nlive in an area where even rush hour traffic doesn\u2019t make for a bad commute\n(pretty much 20 minutes max to get anywhere in town, unless there\u2019s an\naccident somewhere).\n\nSo, factoring in that I have accommodations and a place to stay that isn\u2019t\nterribly far away, I still take vacation time to camp during the week. There\nis no way I\u2019m going to commute to work from my campsite. Set up and tear down\nare exhausting, and almost inevitably take place in the hottest and humid\nweather possible. I have no AC in my pop up, which is fine for a camping\ntrip\u2013but not fine if I have to get up and be \u201cput together\u201d the next day.\n\nIf I\u2019m camping, I\u2019m getting AWAY from daily obligations.

I don\u2019t know how to camp. I\u2019ve never done it. I don\u2019t know what to bring\nor how it all works, or the presumed ettiquette particular to campsites.\n\n2\\. I don\u2019t have any of the equipment. I don\u2019t even know how to buy good\nequipment. I\u2019m sure as hell not first-time-camping with bad/cheap equipment.\nIs the company buying me a tent (and associated stuff) or an RV?\n\n3\\. I can\u2019t drive an RV! Are you nuts? They\u2019re huge!\n\n4\\. I\u2019m not sharing ANYTHING except maybe the actual tent and a campstove. And\nI\u2019m not having second-hand camping equipment either. Not organised by a\ncompany like this. I\u2019m sure the company will be happy to \u201cinvest\u201d in some\nfuture-landfill so they can save the environment by making me camp.\n\n5\\. What do I eat? Isn\u2019t official camping food (just-add-water type)\nexpensive? I\u2019m sure as hell not doing actual cooking in the dark after a full\nday\u2019s work.\n\n6\\. Where do I charge my laptop? How do I keep it secure? And my phone?\n\n7\\. How far is it to that day\u2019s work? Oh, we have to drive, rather than taking\npublic transport or a taxi or walking? Huh, seems like a lot of wasted petrol\nto me.\n\n8\\. The company is paying to decontaminate everything I own (including my own\nbody) after staying in one of those bedbug cabins, right? Even if I don\u2019t\nspecifically *see* a bedbug.\n\n9\\. I guess they\u2019re paying for a bodyguard too if I ever have to go to a\ncampsite alone. Or maybe just really good life insurance?\n\n10\\. And they have some kind of insurance against me catching hypothermia or\nbeing eaten by a bear or having an allergic reaction to the 5000 mosquito\nbites I\u2019ll get. Cuz did I mention I\u2019ve never camped before and have no idea\nhow to do it?\n\n...seriously, I could go on.\n\nThe important points are: 1. Once the company adds up ALL the expenses they\nwould have to cover (without pushing any costs of doing business onto\nemployees) this will not save money. 2. I also seriously doubt it will save\nthe planet either, once you look at everything involved. 3. The absolute\ncrushing dead weight this will put on the employees mentally and physically is\nNOT the best way to ameliorate the already-demanding task of business travel\nand ensure employees perform at their best during the workday.

Otherwise I would\u2019ve said, \u201cyou know,\nyour request made me realize that I don\u2019t trust you not to run off and leave\nme to be eaten by bears, which means we cannot go camping; and I guess it also\nmeans we shouldn\u2019t be together, see ya!\u201d Instead I just kept making excuses\nwhy we could not go in the next month, and then the next.

Uldi* January 21, 2020 at 1:59 pm\n\n~picks jaw up off the floor~\n\nWhere to start with this... First, I\u2019d ask if the non-profit will be providing\nthe camping gear; tents, cooking gear, sleeping bags are all expensive and\nshould not be a burden shouldered by an employee. Second, ask how you are\nexpected to be showered and presentable; most Western countries aren\u2019t known\nfor their public baths, I think. Ask about how meals are to be provided for\nand if you are expected to cook those meals at the camp. Ask if they intend to\ncover any potential luggage fees for the camping gear you will be forced to\ntake with you.\n\nThen push back. The cheaper the gear, the more environmentally unfriendly it\nis. Cheap tents and sleeping bags are mostly polyester/nylon, and cheap lamps\nare usually plastic and battery-powered. Even the expensive tents will have\nplastic rain covers and a plastic groundcloth. Being clean and presentable is\nimportant, and you should gently emphasis this while trying to avoid implying\nthat your boss is fine with being a little stinky. Even if the campsite has\nbathing facilities, they usually aren\u2019t particularly kept super clean and pose\na potential health hazard. Speaking of health hazards: lyme disease. You\nshould ask if they\u2019ll cover any medical expenses associated with camping.\n\nYou can also point out that outdoor cooking gear, while often quite clever, is\nnot for a novice and requires a certain amount of experience to use. Unless\nyou are using MREs, in which case there is the fact that they are packaged in\nplastic, and they still require at least a little familiarity to heat and eat.\n\n\u25bc Collapse 2 replies\n\n    1. Uldi* January 21, 2020 at 2:19 pm\n\nOh, and ask who the non-profit is insured by, and if they will cover any\ninjuries or illnesses that result from camping.\n\nThen contact said insurer to confirm that they will compensate any medical\nexpenses due to lyme disease or injuries associated with camping outdoors. I\nhave more than a sneaking suspicion that if they do have insurance, they have\nneglected to inform the insurer of these additional risks they are taking.\n\n\u25bc Collapse 1 reply\n\n      1.

The only time you should have to camp is\nifnkts actually part of the job, like your going to be cleani g out invasive\nspecies of plants from the forest or something. Since you are PR and outreach\nthere would be no reason to camp. Plus you would be expected to come to the\nmeetings and looked kept up and professional, something that you wouldn\u2019t be\nable to do so in a tent. Furthermore there has to be some way to get\ndiscounted hotel fair. If possible I would add up all of the costs for camping\n(camping capable food, tent, heater, water ) plus costs to get from camp site\nto the meeting. Then do some research and see if their are discounts for\nhotels. Often times if your going to a conference at a hotel they discount\nrooms for those attendjng. You may be able to get it tax free if your a\nnonprofit. I bet it\u2019s going to be less expensive to go to a hotel in the long\nrun.

So sometimes when he doesn\u2019t want to\ndrive 10 hours in one day, he camps. Luckily, he enjoys camping, and luckily a\nconstruction site visit usually means people in work boots & flannel so he\nwon\u2019t look out of place.

I was a ranger for over 40 years and know something about camping and\ncheap-ass employers. Our primary duty station was yep, camping in the\nbackcountry (trail access only) which was great! But, we\u2019d also have to spend\nabout 3 weeks in the \u201cfrontcountry\u201d (roads, buildings, etc.) during training\nwhere we were expected to camp. In the backcountry, we\u2019d have either a station\nor some sort of base setup with at least a sun shower (plastic bag that warms\nwater up in the sun), our spare clothes, food, gear all together. In the\nfrontcountry training: No showers after a day in 100 deg temps doing PT &\ndefensive tactics (we were LE); living in the backs of our pickup trucks;\nnowhere to store our food; no kitchen to cook it in \u2014 it was outrageous.\n\nEvery year we\u2019d push back and, some miraculous years, we\u2019d be allowed to use\nan empty building or fire station. Usually, though, the empty buildings were\nfull of mice or otherwise sub-standard (no electricity, no running water). Oh\nyeah, training was spread out over about 70 miles of frontcountry facilities\nso we\u2019d have to drive to whatever our assigned training was on a particular\nday and be there at 0800. Since our assigned duty station was the backcountry,\nwe figured we should get at least per diem while in FC. That, too, had to be\nfought for each year.\n\nThis was, incidentally, the National Park Service. They\u2019re in charge of some\npretty special places and have a group of terrific dedicated people working\nfor them but they treat their employees abysmally. I\u2019m retired and just \u2014 sigh\n\u2014 venting here after decades of bad experience with them. But, when you\u2019re\nvisiting a National Park, keep in mind that the friendly, cheerful (mostly!)\nrangers and maintenance employees you run into are likely working under truly\nawful conditions.\n\nAlison is spot on here by saying employees need to come together here to push\nback and set limits to how much they\u2019re willing to have their love for and\ndedication to a job be exploited by an organization that is too cheap-ass to\nreally care about them. That\u2019s the only way we won the few and sporadic\nconcessions we did. Take home message: don\u2019t let yourselves be exploited. Stop\nthem now. Good luck!\n\n  147. old curmudgeon* January 21, 2020 at 6:48 pm\n\nOP, if your org is affiliated with a state agency, you are very likely\nrequired to follow state travel regulations \u2013 which I highly doubt involve\nstaying in tents. At least the travel regs in my state certainly don\u2019t\nstipulate that.\n\nMy recommendation is that you reach out to whichever state agency is\nresponsible for developing and implementing statewide policies and procedures\nto find out exactly what is required for state employees who travel. It might\nbe called something like \u201cDepartment of Administration\u201d or a similar term. If\nyou have access to the state network (you should), browse the administrative\nagency\u2019s web page for travel regs for state employees. Or contact a colleague\nfrom another agency and ask them for a link to the state travel policies.\n\nWhen you locate the state regulations governing travel, you can expect them to\ninclude things like \u201cuse a state-owned vehicle,\u201d \u201cmaximum hotel rate is A\ndollars,\u201d \u201cmaximum breakfast rate is X, maximum lunch rate is Y, maximum\ndinner rate is Z\u201d and so on. I can pretty much guarantee you that you will not\nfind anything about being required to stay in a tent when traveling for state\nbusiness. Present that information, either printed out or by email with a link\nto the URL where state travel regs are posted, to your boss with the\nexplanation that while you understand that she\u2019d prefer you to stay in tents,\nthese regulations clearly do not include tents as acceptable habitation for\nemployees traveling on state business.\n\nAnd good luck. I fear that you\u2019ll need it.\n\n  148. LeastBittern* January 21, 2020 at 7:16 pm\n\nIf you\u2019re doing fieldwork instead of meetings and you\u2019re in California this is\npretty standard.

Can\u2019t Sit Still* January 21, 2020 at 8:21 pm\n\nAlso, rabies exposure. Bats are the primary vector from human rabies\ninfections in the US, particularly in the South. If you wake up with a bat in\nyour cabin or tent, you must get treated for rabies. You can roll the dice, of\ncourse, but rabies is 99.99999% fatal, it hurts the whole time you\u2019re dying,\nAND it can take up to two years to show up after exposure.\n\nI learned a lot about rabies while I went through the series of shots this\npast summer, after potential exposure while staying in a mountain cabin. I\ndreamed I was bitten by a vampire and woke up with a bat in the cabin. At\nleast it was a funny story for the ER and the injection clinic. The rabies\nshots aren\u2019t bad, but they give you a terrible headache, like a migraine, but\nworse, somehow. The rabies human immunoglobulin injections are pretty painful\nand I had huge bruises for a long time afterwards.\n\nAbout a week after I finished my shots, rabid bats were found in that county,\nthe first ones in years. The whole treatment cost me $101 out of pocket, but\nmy EOB was about $38k, mostly for the immunoglobulin. I also had to miss work\nfor the injections, since they have to happen on a strict schedule.\n\nAnyway, I won\u2019t be camping or staying in mountain cabins any time soon.\n\n  150.

This is Why We Sing* January 21, 2020 at 10:03 pm\n\nOP here, new to this site and loved reading your poignant and funny replies.\nThe camping requirement is for cost savings, hence the waiver of fee to stay\nfor free in cabin or on campsite at a state park. It\u2019s not to reduce\nenvironmental impact. To clarify, we\u2019re a NPO that operates throughout a\nstate, although not part of the state government, but we find ourselves\nworking together toward a mutual purpose. Our business travel wouldn\u2019t be to\nmajor cities, but around the state (that remains unnamed). One thing not\ndiscussed is the hourly pay. Say an employee drives 3 hours to the park, then\nhas 1-3 hrs to set up/strike camp. Wouldn\u2019t all that time have to be paid? But\nI would stop tracking my travel time as soon as I arrived at a hotel. The\nother worrisome point is the safety/security of a single woman/person camping\nalone in a lonely park. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m ever going to do this, but I was\nfuming when I wrote to Alison and wanted validation. Thank you for that\n\n\u25bc Collapse 2 replies\n\n    1. Working Hypothesis* January 22, 2020 at 6:19 am\n\nValidation gladly provided, OP!! By pretty much all of us, as you see. :) This\nis nuts. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re not doing it.\n\nPlease update us on how the not-doing goes? Are you pushing back directly or\njust ignoring the whole suggestion and continuing to hook hotels like a\nreasonable person? Either way, please let us know what you did to deal with\nthe demand and how your boss responded to it \u2014 we\u2019re rooting for you!\n\n    2. Massive Dynamic* January 22, 2020 at 12:08 pm\n\nGood for you on holding your ground, OP! Please update us on how it goes with\nthe boss!\n\n  154. Anono-me* January 21, 2020 at 11:05 pm\n\nOP I would just stay at a hotel. If your boss pushes back, say it was cheaper.\nMost hotels are between $75 and $200 a night. RV rates average between $100 to\n$350 per night for a week\u2019s rental. Mileage on an RV is between 25 to 40 cents\nper mile and gas mileage is between 8 and 15 miles per gallon. If she pushes\nback on the RV versus a tent, ask her when she\u2019s going to start tenting it.\n\nAlso, I really hope that your state is not in the Upper Midwest. It\u2019s super\nhard to get a camping site and our parks and DNR are constantly underfunded.\nIf I found out that my state was giving away campgrounds passes to contractors\nrather than letting families compete to rent the spot (and pay money to rent\nthem) I would be livid. Actually I\u2019m probably going to contact my state\nrepresentative tomorrow and ask them to look into it. Even if it\u2019s not the\nsame state, this is a boneheaded enough idea that somebody probably is doing\nit here too.\n\n  155. Roughing it* January 22, 2020 at 12:27 am\n\nI shared this post today with colleagues before heading off to a hotel. Where\nthe power shut off shortly after I arrived. About 20 minutes later there\u2019s a\nknock on the door from Mack, the front desk clerk, offering me a glow stick.\nI\u2019m kind of sorry I don\u2019t have my camping gear with me.\n\n  156. Oh Snap!* January 22, 2020 at 10:52 am\n\nI photographed a wedding at a resort in the Catskills a couple of summers ago\nand they put us in a \u201cglamping\u201d tent for the night. It was just big enough for\ntwo twin beds but they managed to squeeze a full size AC unit in the tent that\nhad been left on full blast until we checked in at 11pm. And in spite of it\nbeing the middle of the summer, deep in the valley next to a river the\nnighttime temp was in the low 50\u2019s. We had light cotton blankets and even\nthough I was able to track down someone at the resort to get us more blankets\nI still wore all my clothes and barely slept a wink because it was so\nunbearably cold in that tent. I was exhausted for days afterward. If there\u2019s\never a time you need to be well rested it\u2019s when work is involved.\n\n  157. Former Employee* January 22, 2020 at 2:30 pm\n\nWhen Possible = Never!\n\nI have been asked how I know I wouldn\u2019t like camping since I\u2019ve never tried\nit. My response is that I\u2019m also sure I wouldn\u2019t like prison even though\n(thank goodness) I\u2019ve never experienced it personally.\n\nTo me, camping is equivalent to living like a homeless person. I don\u2019t want to\nsleep outdoors, on the ground, go to the \u201cbathroom\u201d outdoors, etc. I don\u2019t\nunderstand the attraction, but if someone enjoys it, great for them.\n\n  158. vlookup* January 22, 2020 at 2:35 pm\n\nI love camping and would totally camp during a business trip if given the\nopportunity.\n\nThat said, even as an outdoorsy person who already has the necessary gear and\nskills, I can\u2019t see camping working for typical white collar business travel.\nGetting yourself looking presentable, getting from the campground to your\nmeeting/conference location, charging electronics, accessing wifi to do any\nafter hours email \u2014 even aside from all the ways this requirement is\ninappropriate, which have been adequately covered above, it doesn\u2019t seem\nlogistically feasible for any travel where you need to show up to an office in\na city looking nice.\n\n  159. Amlan Gupta* January 22, 2020 at 6:37 pm\n\nI\u2019m going to be an outlier and also, which happens rarely, disagree with\nAllison. But, I\u2019ll say it bluntly \u2013 live by the ideals you want to push onto\neveryone else. So, don\u2019t travel, when you do, live in tents, etc. If you\nbelieve strongly in what you are doing, then you should willingly want to do\nso. That is worthy of respect even if one disagrees with your ideals.\nOtherwise, sorry but you are just another hypocrite like Dicaprio lecturing us\nto be green while flying around in his private jet and lounging on his yacht.\n\nI realize I will get a lot of vitriol for this but that is fine. I fully\nexpect that for daring to go against the religion of the day.\n\n  160. Nannerpuddin* January 22, 2020 at 6:54 pm\n\nIf my new boss told me I\u2019d have to sleep in a tent, I\u2019d be looking around for\nthe Candid Camera crew.\n\n  161. RB* January 22, 2020 at 7:26 pm\n\nStraight-up NOPE for me. Just weighing in here...\n\n  162. Raisin Girl* January 23, 2020 at 12:05 pm\n\nCan you imagine seeing someone suit up in a campground shower?
