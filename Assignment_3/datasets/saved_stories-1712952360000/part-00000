Experts fear it may someday evolve to spread among humans.\n\nA cattle feed lot in Texas, USA.Photograph: Bim/Getty Images\n\nLast Friday, a health alert from the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention pinged its way across the inboxes of clinicians and state health\ndepartments all over the US. The message described how a dairy farm worker in\nTexas had contracted H5N1, the highly infectious strain of avian influenza, or\nbird flu, that\u2019s currently circling worldwide. The dairy worker had caught the\nvirus, apparently, from cattle.\n\nThe CDC\u2019s alert urged doctors to be vigilant and consider H5N1 a possibility\nin any patients presenting with acute respiratory symptoms or sore eyes who\nhad recently been in contact with animals.\n\nAround the world, virologists responded to the news with varying degrees of\nalarm. While this is the second confirmed human case of H5N1 infection in the\nUS in the past two years\u2014in 2022, a worker at a poultry farm in Colorado\ncontracted it from infected birds\u2014it appears to be the first known case of the\nvirus jumping from another mammal to humans.\n\nAccording to Raina MacIntyre, who heads the Biosecurity Program at the Kirby\nInstitute in Sydney, the biggest concern is that as the virus adapts more and\nmore to mammalian species, it will gain mutations that make it better equipped\nto spread between humans. So far, the public health threat from H5N1 has been\nminimal because it cannot easily enter the cells of the human nose and mouth,\nthough when the virus does infect people, it can be deadly.\n\n\u201cThe virus is not one that can transmit easily between humans,\u201d says\nMacIntyre. \u201cThe key event that could result in a human pandemic is a mutation\nthat switched the affinity of the virus to certain receptors in the human\nrespiratory tract.\u201d\n\nH5N1 is not a new virus. It was first detected in chickens in Scotland way\nback in 1959, and between January 2003 and December 2023, 882 human cases were\nreported across 23 countries, with a case fatality rate of 52 percent. The\nsubtype that infected the Texan farm worker, known as 2.3.4.4b, has been\nspreading in the wild on an unprecedented scale over the past four years.\nReports suggest that it has killed hundreds of millions of domestic and wild\nbirds since 2020, while at least 48 mammal species across 26 countries have\nalso perished from the virus. This strain of H5N1 has already spread so far\nand wide that it has even reached Antarctica and infected species ranging from\nfoxes to polar bears.\n\nMacIntyre describes the spiraling infections in animals as being\n\u201cunprecedented\u201d and says that urgent surveillance is needed to monitor whether\nH5N1 begins spreading between pigs or ferrets, animals which have a similar\nreceptor profile to humans.\n\n\u201cI have been following H5N1 since 1997, and the current situation is extremely\nworrying,\u201d MacIntyre says. \u201cIn the past, H5N1 epidemics in birds were sporadic\nand would die down after culling of infected poultry. Since 2021 the pattern\nhas changed, and it has not gone away but steadily increased.\u201d In this time,\nmany new mammalian species have been infected. \u201cSome may be suitable genetic\nmixing vessels to create a human pandemic strain,\u201d she says.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nThis Woman Will Decide Which Babies Are Born\n\nJason Kehe\n\n  * Politics\n\nInside the Election Denial Groups Planning to Disrupt November\n\nDavid Gilbert\n\n  * Security\n\nDuckDuckGo Is Taking Its Privacy Fight to Data Brokers\n\nMatt Burgess\n\n  * Business\n\nBeeper Took On Apple\u2019s iMessage Dominance. Now It\u2019s Been Acquired\n\nLauren Goode\n\nIn recent weeks, health officials in the US have detected the presence of H5N1\nin cows from 16 herds across six states, the biggest known outbreak in cattle.\nResearch currently suggests, however, that the viral load is greatest in the\nanimals\u2019 milk, hinting that H5N1 may be spreading through contaminated\nequipment, such as milking machines, rather than through the air, a\ntransmission pathway which would be harder to stop.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we need to panic; I think we just need to be alert,\u201d says Nadav\nDavidovitz, an epidemiologist and public health expert at Ben-Gurion\nUniversity of the Negev in Israel. \u201cWe need to invest in more routine animal\nsurveillance and create a system of sharing data about this virus. But one of\nthe problems is that there\u2019s a lot of pandemic fatigue.\u201d\n\nIf there is a human outbreak, MacIntyre says, the public health systems around\nthe world are much better prepared to cope compared with a more novel virus,\nlike SARS-CoV-2 was when it emerged. This is because influenza has been\nsubject to decades of intensive research. The World Health Organization has a\nlist of potential candidate vaccines for various subtypes of H5N1 that could\nbe mass produced at short notice. The CDC has revealed that the strain\nisolated in the Texan farm worker is closely related to two H5N1 strains that\ncan be targeted by existing vaccine candidates.\n\n\u201cThe last human influenza pandemic was in 2009, and vaccines were available\nsix months after the first cases,\u201d says MacIntyre. \u201cWe now have many new\nvaccine technologies that can be made faster. We also have antivirals which\nwork against all flu strains and do not need to be matched. Getting your\nseasonal flu shot can also confer a small amount of cross-protection.\u201d\n\nOther researchers point out that H5N1 remains a virus that is best adapted to\nbirds, and the isolated infections of farm workers do not suggest that it will\nsuddenly acquire the ability to spread rapidly between humans or even cows.\n\u201cThe virus sequence data still shows that the virus is an avian virus, so the\nlikelihood of it persisting [long-term] in cattle will be low,\u201d says Munir\nIqbal, who leads an avian influenza research group at the Pirbright Institute\nin the UK.\n\nInstead, a more pressing concern may be the impact H5N1 is already having on\nfood security. Maurice Pitesky, a researcher at the UC Davis School of\nVeterinary Medicine, told WIRED that in the past week, two of the biggest\ncommercial poultry facilities in the US have reported an H5N1 outbreak,\nresulting in the euthanasia of nearly 4 million laying hens. Last year,\nsimilar outbreaks cost the US government half a billion dollars in\ncompensation payouts to poultry producers and caused a surge in the price of\neggs.\n\n\u201cThe impact on commercial poultry from a welfare, economic, and food security\nperspective is unprecedented,\u201d says Pitesky. \u201cWe can\u2019t seem to get this under\ncontrol, and we\u2019re kind of teetering a little in terms of how far this could\npotentially propagate and continue to spread in farm animals throughout the\nworld.\u201d\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nThis Woman Will Decide Which Babies Are Born\n\nJason Kehe\n\n  * Politics\n\nInside the Election Denial Groups Planning to Disrupt November\n\nDavid Gilbert\n\n  * Security\n\nDuckDuckGo Is Taking Its Privacy Fight to Data Brokers\n\nMatt Burgess\n\n  * Business\n\nBeeper Took On Apple\u2019s iMessage Dominance. Now It\u2019s Been Acquired\n\nLauren Goode\n\nAs a recent example of what may ensue, Pitesky points to the repeated African\nswine fever outbreaks across various Asian countries in the past decade, which\ndecimated the pig farming industry to the extent that pork was briefly usurped\nby poultry as the most widely consumed animal protein on the planet. Pitesky\nargues, however, that the current model of governments heavily compensating\nfarmers for their livestock losses in the wake of a viral outbreak is\nfinancially unsustainable, and more investment needs to be diverted toward AI-\ndriven technologies that can prevent these infections in the first place.\n\n\u201cI work on predictive models, using a combination of weather radar, satellite\nimagery, and machine learning, to understand how waterfowl behavior around\ndifferent farms is changing,\u201d says Pitesky. \u201cWe can use this information to\nunderstand which of the 50,000 to 60,000 commercial poultry facilities in the\nUS are at most risk, and form strategies to protect all the birds in those\nfacilities.\u201d\n\nTechnology may ultimately offer a path toward eliminating the virus in\ncommercial poultry. In October, a team of researchers in the UK published a\nstudy in the journal Nature Communications demonstrating that it is possible\nto use the gene-editing tool Crispr to make chickens resistant to avian\ninfluenza. This was done through editing genes that make the proteins ANP32A,\nANP32B, and ANP32E in chickens, which the virus uses to gain access to chicken\ncells.\n\nCrispr has been shown to be capable of making livestock resistant to other\ninfections such as the cancer-causing viral disease avian leukosis and porcine\nreproductive and respiratory syndrome, which is responsible for widespread\neconomic losses in pig farms.\n\n\u201cThe currently available methods are the use of strict farm biosecurity,\npoultry vaccinations in some countries, and massive depopulation of infected\nor exposed chicken flocks,\u201d says Alewo Idoko-Akoh at the University of\nBristol, the lead researcher on the Nature Communications study. \u201cThese\nmethods have been partially successful but have so far failed to stop\nrecurrent bird flu outbreaks around the world. Gene editing of chickens to\nintroduce disease resistance should be considered as an additional tool for\npreventing or limiting the spread of bird flu.\u201d\n\nPitesky described the paper as \u201creally interesting\u201d but pointed out that it\nwould require widespread public acceptance toward consuming gene-edited\nchicken for it to become commercially viable. \u201cI think that those\ntechnological solutions have a lot of potential, but the issue more than\nanything, especially in the United States, is sentiment toward chickens that\nhave been genetically modified,\u201d he says.\n\nFor now, Iqbal says that the best chance of keeping avian influenza under\ncontrol is more active surveillance efforts in animal populations around the\nworld, to understand how and where the H5N1 is spreading.\n\n\u201cThe surveillance system has been improved, and any infection that appears\nunusual is thoroughly investigated,\u201d he says of the situation in the US. \u201cThis\nhas helped to identify unusual outbreaks, such as infections in goats and\ncattle.\u201d However, he says, much more work is needed to detect the virus in\nanimals that don\u2019t show signs of disease.\n\n## You Might Also Like ...\n\n  * Navigate election season with our Politics Lab newsletter and podcast\n\n  * Think Google\u2019s \u201cIncognito mode\u201d protects your privacy?
