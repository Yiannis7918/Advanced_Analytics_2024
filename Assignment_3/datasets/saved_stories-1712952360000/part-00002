Planned Power Capacity is\nNearly All Zero-Carbon\n\nFor the first time since the mid-20^th century, over 95 percent of this year\u2019s\nplanned new electric-generating capacity in the United States is zero-\ncarbon.[1] Natural gas has long been relied on to ensure the nation\u2019s power\ngrids deliver electricity when needed. However, recent trends indicate a\nshift: Between 2020 and 2024, the share of new capacity burning natural gas\nfell from 21 percent to 4 percent while the share of new battery storage\ncapacity has skyrocketed, increasing from 1 percent to 23 percent. This\nstunning growth in battery deployment means that moving forward, utilities\nwill be able to bring online even more renewable energy\u2014such as solar or\nwind\u2014without relying as much on natural gas.\n\nWhile there is still plenty of existing fossil fuel capacity across the United\nStates, this increase in new capacity from battery storage is an important\nmilestone toward a fully clean power grid. There has already been significant\nprogress reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the U.S. power sector.\nOver the past two decades, a drop in carbon-intensive coal-fired generation\ncoupled with the rise in less carbon-intensive natural gas[2] and zero-carbon\nrenewable generation has led to a steady decline in power sector GHG emissions\n(Figure 1).\n\nHowever, because natural gas use has continued to trend upwards, some have\nsuggested that there is a complementarity between renewables and natural gas\nthat will stall progress on net zero emissions goals. The argument goes: As\nrenewables become more common, so too is the need for electricity that can\nreadily meet variable demand when there is no sun or wind. Because natural gas\nis dispatchable\u2014that is, it can, unlike sun or wind, be readily switched on or\noff\u2014it provides a quick supply response that allows utilities to provide power\nexactly when it is needed. Given this possible complementarity between\nrenewables and natural gas, it is hard to imagine achieving a zero-carbon\ngrid\u2014particularly as electricity demand grows with increased adoption of\nelectric vehicles, heat pumps, data centers, and other technologies.\n\nRecent data, however, suggest a new phase of decarbonization is upon us. The\nEnergy Information Agency reported that for 2024, planned natural gas capacity\nis at a 25-year low of 2.5 gigawatts (GW), or just 4 percent of total planned\ncapacity. This is down from 21 percent of planned capacity as recently as 2020\n(Figure 2). Meanwhile, there is an unprecedented rise in total planned\ncapacity coming from battery storage, up from a mere 1 percent of planned\ncapacity in 2020 to 23 percent (14.3 GW) in 2024. This new battery capacity is\noccurring while solar and wind capacity continues to grow, with 44.6 GW of\nplanned capacity for 2024, or 71 percent of total. Altogether, combining\nbatteries, renewables, and nuclear, a stunning 96 percent of new electric-\ngenerating capacity for 2024 is zero-carbon. And while fossil fuels still\naccount for 60 percent of existing electricity generation, having almost no\nfossil capacity planned for 2024 represents a significant milestone on the\nroad to a net-zero future.\n\nWhat is happening here? Just as natural gas generators can ramp down when\nrenewables are available and ramp up when they are not, batteries can charge\nand discharge. This makes batteries a complement to renewables and a\nsubstitute for natural gas. In fact, one version of a net-zero future has\nrenewables both providing power when the sun is out or the wind is blowing and\nalso charging batteries that can discharge power at other times\u2014like charging\nyour phone while talking on it. This is how the power grid can become\nemissions-free: When the sun is down or the wind is slow, batteries discharge\npower so that electrons from renewables can supply power at all times.\n\nIn the coming years, the installation of batteries that can replace natural\ngas will likely accelerate. Between 2020 and 2023, utility-scale battery\ncapacity in operation more than tripled. The share of planned battery capacity\nof total annual planned capacity has increased in nearly every major power\ngrid since 2017, with battery shares exceeding 25 percent in many grids for\n2024.\n\nThe policies of the Biden-Harris Administration have played an important role.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) introduced an investment tax credit for\nutility-scale battery storage covering up to 50 percent of the developer\u2019s\ninvestment. This investment tax credit is part of a broader package of demand-\nand supply-side policies under the IRA that include subsidies for residential\nadoption of batteries and investment and production tax credits for domestic\nmanufacturing of batteries, which CEA details in Chapter 6 of this year\u2019s\nEconomic Report of the President. Since the passage of the IRA, domestic\nmanufacturing investments in battery production\u2014for both grid scale and EV\nbatteries\u2014have increased from $2.3 billion to $9.9 billion according to the\nClean Investment Monitor. As of 2023:Q4, battery manufacturing investments\nrepresented 67 percent of investments in clean technology manufacturing.\n\nThese policies will supercharge battery deployment in the coming years,\nparticularly as two ongoing trends continue to increase the demand for\nbatteries. First, increasing electrification of the economy, from EVs to heat\npumps, is increasing electricity demand for the first time in over a decade.\nSecond, even without increases in overall electricity demand, there are\nmoments in places such as in California and Texas where excess supply of zero-\ncarbon, zero-marginal cost renewable electricity must be turned away from the\ngrid. This curtailment of renewable energy is expected to grow. Batteries can\nabsorb excess clean power, simultaneously meeting greater electricity demand\nand enabling accelerated power sector decarbonization.\n\n[1] CEA calculations based on data from Meng (2022). Hydropower, which is\nzero-carbon, was a large share of new power capacity during the first half of\nthe 20^th century. We henceforth use renewables to refer to only wind and\nsolar.\n\n[2] Natural gas is roughly half as carbon-intensive as coal.\n\n## Stay Connected\n\nOpt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.\n\nShare\n\n  * Share this page on Facebook\n  * Share this page on X\n  * https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2024/04/11/the-next-phase-of-electricity-decarbonization-planned-power-capacity-is-nearly-all-zero-carbon/?utm_source=link\n\nThe White House 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW Washington, DC 20500\n\nWH.gov\n\nScroll to Top\n\nTop\n\n", "frontpage": false}
