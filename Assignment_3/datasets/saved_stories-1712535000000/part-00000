The advent of\n> artificial intelligence (AI) promises better decision-making and increased\n> military effectiveness. However, there is still debate about how AI systems,\n> especially large language models (LLMs), behave as compared to humans. To\n> this end, we use a wargame experiment with 107 national security expert\n> human players designed to look at crisis escalation in a fictional US-China\n> scenario and compare human players to LLM-simulated responses. We find\n> considerable agreement in the LLM and human responses but also significant\n> quantitative and qualitative differences between simulated and human players\n> in the wargame, motivating caution to policymakers before handing over\n> autonomy or following AI-based strategy recommendations.\n\nSubjects:| Computers and Society (cs.CY); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI);\nComputation and Language (cs.CL)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2403.03407 [cs.CY]  \n(or arXiv:2403.03407v1 [cs.CY] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2403.03407arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Max Lamparth [view email] [v1] Wed, 6 Mar 2024 02:23:32 UTC (152 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Human vs. Machine: Language Models and\nWargames, by Max Lamparth and 5 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CY\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2403\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI cs.CL\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
