Read below for info on upcoming releases. The\nnext update will probably not be until early January.\n\n### Introduction\n\nbsp2wrl will convert any Quake BSP map into OpenInventor, VRML 1.0, or VRML\n2.0. It includes lights, viewpoints, and full texturing with proper\ntexturemapping coordinates.\n\nOne cool application is to build a VRML preview of your Quake maps so people\ncan check them out without having to start Quake.\n\nIt was originally used as a small part of our final 6.837 project, because we\nneeded large architectural worlds to work with. You can view our project\nreport.\n\nThe Quake worlds are incredibly complex and will push your VRML browser to the\nlimit. Each one has anywhere from 2000-8000 polygons, each textured with one\nof 60-100 different texture maps.\n\nLive3D appears to handle these VRML files rather well, and you can actually\nmove around at a reasonable pace in some of them. Live3D is rumored to have a\nnew release out soon (with Netscape 4.0); when it comes, it should provide\neven better performance\n\nFor UNIX machines, I have had the best luck with VRweb, except for the\nannoying problem where it prints an error message for every light past #8.\nThis is not a bug, really, just a warning that since OpenGL only handles 8\nlights, it is ignoring all the extra ones. Unfortunately, you get warned on\nevery render, and some files have over 200 lights. Turning off lighting\ncalculations should make it go away. Texturing, while slow, is accurate.\n\nYou may also be interested in Ken Russell's work with DOOM and VRML at the\nMedia Lab with his wadtoiv and doomtovrml2 programs.\n\nThere are two known problems. First, some viewers cannot cope with the large\nnumber of pointlights, and those that do appear to render them oddly. Since\nthe textures are pretty dark, that means that some viewers will render the\nQuake worlds very darkly. You may need to adjust gamma correction in order to\nsee more detail.\n\nSecond, all viewpoint rotations are at 90 degrees; we ignore the angle\ninformation for now. It will be fixed later.\n\n### Quake VRML\n\nHere is the full set of shareware Quake levels. Thanks to Brad Porter for\ngiving us the needed server space. As we update bsp2wrl, these VRML files will\nbe updated accordingly. All files are gzipped, and range from 70-250K before\ntextures.\n\nThese files are not available ungzipped, as there is not enough space.\n\nPlease try E1M7 first! Once you've verified that your browser can handle the\nrather small House of Chthon, try the others.\n\nVRML 1.0| VRML 2.0  \n---|---  \nStart| Start  \nE1M1| E1M1  \nE1M2| E1M2  \nE1M3| E1M3  \nE1M4| E1M4  \nE1M5| E1M5  \nE1M6| E1M6  \nE1M7| E1M7  \nE1M8| E1M8  \n  \n### Sample Screens\n\nBelow is some sample output. Click on the images to see the large version.\n\nSGI Indy running OpenInventor| Outside wireframe shot, same Indy  \n---|---  \n  \n### Download bsp2wrl V1.2\n\nFor now, we are only offering binaries for Linux and Win95/NT systems. A DOS\nversion may appear later. An IRIX version will have to wait until we write in\ncode to handle big-endian systems. Source code is not yet available.\n\nThe Linux version has been known to not work on systems with really old\nlibraries.\n\n  * Linux binary\n  * Win NT/95 binary\n\n### Future Plans\n\n  * Fixing the lights. This is extremely viewer-dependent. We will be looking at this more closely.\n  * Fixing camera rotation. It is currently always at 90 degrees on the Z axis.\n  * Using VRML 2.0 features to enable the trigger boxes to work as they do in Quake.\n  * Windows 95 GUI.\n\nSend additional thoughts and feature requests to bsp2wrl@mit.edu.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis project would not have been possible without the following:\n\n\\- from the guys at id Software. - for VRML and Moving Worlds. - for giving us\nthe time to write this program.\n\nQuake Documentation V3.4 - by Olivier Montanuy and others for helpful hints on\nBSP files.\n\nhits since 12/15/96.\n\n###### (C) 1996 Patrick McCormick Contact pmccormi@mit.edu with any questions\nor comments.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
