The present Union Flag dates from 1801 when St Patrick\u2019s Cross was\nadded to represent Ireland. It then became possible to display the flag,\nincorrectly, upside down. There is no Flag Act in UK law, and the Union Flag\nis the national flag by long-established custom and practice rather than by\nstatute.\n\n### The Flag Protocol of the United Kingdom\n\nThe national flags of the United Kingdom (ie. the Union Flag and the flags of\nEngland, Scotland and Wales) should be displayed only in a dignified manner\nbefitting the national emblems. They should not be displayed in a position\ninferior to any other flag or ensign.\n\nIt is improper to use the national flags as a table or seat cover or as a\nmasking for boxes, barriers, or the intervening space between a dais or\nplatform and the floor. The use of any of the national flags to cover a\nstatue, monument or plaque for an unveiling ceremony is discouraged.\n\nThe First Union Flag\n\n### Flying the Flag\n\nFlags may be flown on every day of the year. Government and local authority\nbuildings in England, Scotland and Wales are encouraged to fly national flags\nevery day of the year (the flying of flags at certain locations in Northern\nIreland is constrained by The Flags Regulations [Northern Ireland] 2000 and\nPolice Emblems and Flag Regulations [Northern Ireland] 2002).[2]\n\nFlags are normally flown from sunrise to sunset but they may also be flown at\nnight, when they should be illuminated.\n\nNo permission is needed to fly the national flags and they are excluded from\nmost planning and advertising regulations (but flagpoles may not be).\n\nNational flags should never be flown in a worn or damaged condition, or when\nsoiled. To do so is to show disrespect for the nations they represent.\n\nImportant: the Union Flag has a correct way up \u2013 in the half of the flag\nnearest the flagpole, the wider diagonal white stripe must be above the red\ndiagonal stripe, as Scotland\u2019s St Andrew\u2019s Cross takes precedence over\nIreland\u2019s St Patrick\u2019s Cross. It is most improper to fly the flag upside down.\n\nIf a purely decorative effect is desired it is better to confine the display\nto flags of lesser status; for example, house flags, pennants or coloured\nbunting.\n\nThe Modern Union Flag\n\nThis Flag is Upside Down!\n\n#### Position of Honour\n\nThe order of precedence of flags in the UK is: Royal Standards, the Union\nFlag, the flag of the host country (England, Scotland, Wales, etc.), flags of\nother nations (in alphabetical order, see the list below), the Commonwealth\nFlag, the European Union Flag, county flags, flags of cities or towns, banners\nof arms, and house flags. See Appendix B for a detailed precedence list and\nspecial precedence orders for international organisations.\n\nWhen British national flags are flown with the flags of other nations each\nflag should be the same size (or have the same width \u2013 the measurement from\ntop to bottom) and should fly from a separate flagpole of the same height.[3]\nThe UK\u2019s flag shape of 3:5 works well with nearly all other nations\u2019 flags and\nit is recommended to use these proportions if a standard size is required for\nall the flags in a display.[4]\n\nThe senior British national flag (eg. the Union Flag or the flag of England,\nScotland or Wales) should be raised first and lowered last, unless all the\nflags can be raised and lowered simultaneously. Flags should be raised and\nlowered in a dignified manner. An alternative British tradition for flag\nraising is to hoist the flag while rolled up and secured with a thin piece of\ncotton or a slip knot. A sharp tug of the halyard will break the cotton and\nrelease the flag to fly free. This is known as \u2018breaking\u2019 the flag, and is\nsometimes used to signal the beginning of an event, or the arrival of a VIP.\n\n1\\. Fold in half\n\n2\\. Fold in half again\n\n3\\. Fold the last 1/3 inwards\n\n4\\. Roll towards the heading\n\n5\\. Tie with light cotton\n\n6\\. The flag is now ready for breaking\n\nNational flags should be displayed as follows:\n\n#### In Front of and On a Building\n\nWhere there are two or more flagpoles parallel to the building line, the\nsenior national flag should be the first flag on the left of an observer\nfacing the main entrance of the building. The remaining flags then appear in\norder of precedence from left to right.\n\nWhere there are two or more flagpoles on the forecourt of a building angled to\nthe main entrance, the senior national flag should be flown on the outermost\npole when the flagpoles are to the left of the main entrance and on the\ninnermost pole when the flagpoles are to the right of the main entrance, as\nshown in the diagram.\n\nIf only one flag is to be flown and there are two flagpoles, it should be\nflown on the flagpole to the observer\u2019s left. If there are more than two\nflagpoles, it should be flown as near as possible to the centre. This only\napplies when the other flagpoles remain empty. It is permissible to fly the\nsame national flag on more than one flagpole by repeating the order of\nprecedence.\n\nIf one flagpole is higher than the rest, then the senior national flag can fly\nfrom that flagpole; however no non-UK national flags can be flown on the other\nflagpoles. These can be used for more junior flags such as county and house\nflags. Alternatively the higher flagpole can be left empty and the remaining\nflagpoles used. In general when siting flagpoles it is preferable to keep them\nat the same level to avoid protocol restrictions.\n\nThe appropriate size of flag for any flagpole is a matter of aesthetics but,\nas a guide, a ground-level flagpole should have a flag whose length (its\nlonger dimension) is no more than 1/3 of the pole\u2019s height. A flagpole on top\nof a building may need a larger flag because of the added height of the\nbuilding.\n\n#### Within a Circle of Flags\n\nIn a semi-circle of flags representing a number of nations, the senior\nnational flag should be in the centre. The remaining flags should be placed\nwith the next most senior flag (or first in alphabetical order if all the\nflags are of equal seniority) on the left of the central flag, the next on the\nright of the central flag, the next on the 2nd left from the central flag, and\ncontinuing to alternate left and right.\n\nIn an enclosed circle of flags representing a number of nations, the senior\nnational flag should be flown on the flagpole immediately opposite the main\nentrance to the venue, or above the Royal Box if there is no main entrance.\nThe remaining flags should be arranged as for the semi-circle of flags\ndescribed above. Alternatively they can be arranged alphabetically, going\nclockwise.\n\n#### From a Flagpole with Yardarm and Gaff\n\nWhen displayed on a flagpole fitted with yardarms (horizontal cross-pieces),\nthe senior national flag or ensign[5] should be flown from the starboard\nyardarm (the right as viewed from the rear, the left as viewed from the\nfront).\n\nIf the flagpole is fitted with a gaff (a short pole attached to the flagpole\nat an angle \u2013 see diagram), the senior ensign should be flown from the gaff.\nIf there is no ensign to be flown, the gaff should be left empty and the\nsenior national flag flown from the starboard yardarm, as described above.\n\nA yacht club burgee or distinguishing flag can be flown from the masthead, the\nhighest point of the flagpole.\n\n#### In Processions\n\nThe senior national flag should always lead in a single file of flags.\n\nWhen two or more flags are carried side-by-side, the senior national flag\ntakes the position of honour at the right-hand side of the line facing the\ndirection of movement (the left of an observer watching the line approach).\n\nWhen passing the person taking the salute the flag should be lowered so that\nthe staff is horizontal. This can be done by simply lowering the staff\nstraight ahead, or by lowering the staff towards the person taking the salute\nand then swinging it round to straight ahead. All the movements should be slow\nand dignified. After the salute, the flag should be raised again.\n\n#### With Crossed Flags\n\nWhenever crossed with the flag of another nation or organisation, the senior\nnational flag should be on the left of the observer facing the flag. Its staff\nshould be in front of the staff of the other flag.\n\n#### Suspended Vertically Above a Street\n\nCare should be taken to ensure that all flags suspended vertically across a\nstreet are hung to be seen from the same direction.\n\n#### Flat Against a Surface\n\nUnion Flag \u2013 If hung horizontally or vertically, the broad white diagonal\nshould be uppermost in the top-left corner.\n\nOther flags \u2013 If hung vertically, the edge that would normally be the top of\nthe flag should be on the left, so, for example, ensigns have their Union Flag\ncanton in the upper left corner. On ensigns that have an armorial badge, if\npossible the badge should be upright, and the correct way round.\n\n#### On a Speaker\u2019s Platform\n\nWhen displayed from a staff, on a speaker\u2019s platform, the senior national flag\nshould be placed on the right-hand side of the speaker, and therefore to the\naudience\u2019s left.\n\nFor interior or parade use a \u2018dress flag\u2019 may be used. This is sometimes made\nof silk or satin with a fringe around three sides. The fringe can be gold or\nred/white/blue for the Union Flag, red/white for St George\u2019s Cross, blue/white\nfor St Andrew\u2019s Cross and green/white for the Red Dragon. The fringe is purely\ndecorative.\n\n#### Double-Flagging\n\nSometimes it may be desired to display two flags when only one flagpole is\navailable. As long as both flags are British this is possible. The senior flag\nshould fly at the top, with a gap of about 30cm (12\u201d), assuming there is\nenough vertical space on the pole. For example, the Union Flag can be flown\nover the flag of England, Scotland or Wales (as shown), or over a county, city\nor house flag. When flags are at half-mast the lower flag must be removed.\n\n#### As a Pall for a Coffin\n\nIf a national flag is to be used on a coffin, it should be placed so that the\ntop-left corner of the flag is over the deceased\u2019s left shoulder. The flag\nshould be removed before interment or cremation and folded.\n\nIf the flag is to be retained by the next of kin it can be folded using the\nRoyal Navy\u2019s method shown here, based on a 1:2 flag (138cm x 276cm) with no\nfittings (ie. ropes, toggles or clips), or using the method shown above:\n\nA Coffin with a Fitted Cover\n\n(if a flag is used, 1:2 proportions fit the shape of the coffin better)\n\nThe Union Flag is pulled taut. The Union Flag is folded in half, lengthways\n(Fig. 1).\n\nKeeping the Union Flag taut it is then folded in half (lengthways) a second\ntime (Fig. 2).\n\nA straight fold of 1/14 of the flag\u2019s length (20cm on a casket cover) is taken\nfrom the foot of the Union Flag (Fig. 3). This fold may not be necessary, or\nmay need to be a different length, depending upon the shape, size and material\nof the flag being folded \u2013 practise first!\n\nThe first triangular fold is made ensuring it is within 5mm of the straight\nedge (Fig. 4).\n\nThe triangular folding procedure continues until it reaches the head of the\nUnion Flag (Figs. 5, 6 & 7).\n\nAny remainder is tucked away into the fold of the triangular shape (Fig. 8 &\n9).\n\nThe Union Flag ready for presentation (Fig. 10).\n\n#### On Vehicles\n\nA car flag should be placed on a staff fitted to the front-right wing, in the\ncentre of front edge of the bonnet, or in the centre of the front edge of the\nroof. If two flags are to be flown, the senior flag should be on the front-\nright wing and the junior flag on the front-left wing.\n\nWhen flags are painted onto a vehicle, or on the tail fin of an aircraft, the\nflag on the port side should show the obverse of the flag (ie. the flagpole on\nthe left), while that on the starboard side should show the reverse (ie. the\nflagpole on the right). On surfaces perpendicular to the direction of travel\n(eg. the back of the vehicle) the obverse of the flag should be shown.\n\n#### On Uniforms\n\nWhen flag shoulder patches are worn on uniforms the flag on the left shoulder\nor sleeve should show the obverse of the flag (ie. the flagpole at the\nwearer\u2019s front). If there is a patch on the right shoulder or sleeve it should\nshow the reverse of the flag (ie. still with the flagpole at the wearer\u2019s\nfront). If more than one flag is to be worn, the Union Flag should be at the\ntop.\n\n#### At Civilian Transport Facilities\n\nCivilian marine facilities should fly the Civil Ensign (the undefaced Red\nEnsign) as their national flag, unless they belong to an organisation that\nholds a warrant for a special ensign, when that ensign should be used instead.\n\nCivilian air facilities, such as airports and airfields, should fly the Civil\nAir Ensign as their national flag, rather than the Union Flag. They may\nadditionally fly the flag of England, Scotland or Wales and the appropriate\ncounty flag.\n\nThe Civil Air Ensign\n\n### Pennants\n\nIt is sometimes impractical to fly a full-size flag throughout the year \u2013\nflags can wear out quickly, especially if they are flown in adverse\nconditions. Bare flagpoles are a sad sight. The pennant, or vimpel, is a\nsolution to these problems. The long narrow streamer-like flags are designed\nto be left flying day and night. The optional single point attachment and the\nnarrow tail reduce wear and their length means that they can be easily\nrepaired.\n\nUnion\n\nEngland\n\nScotland\n\nWales\n\n### The Royal Standard\n\nThe Royal Standard (actually the Royal Banner \u2013 a standard being an heraldic\nflag similar to the pennants above) should only be flown whilst the Royal\nperson is on the premises, being hoisted (or broken) on their arrival and\nlowered following their departure. If the Royal person is to be present in a\nbuilding, the Lord Chamberlain\u2019s Department or the Royal person\u2019s private\nsecretary should be consulted. They will advise on the flag to be flown. The\nRoyal Standard is never hoisted when the Royal person is passing in\nprocession.\n\nThe Royal Standard takes precedence over all other flags in the United\nKingdom, including the Union Flag.\n\nThe Royal Standard\n\n(in Scotland the design is different)\n\n### Flags at Half-mast\n\nHalf-mast means the flag is flown two-thirds of the way up the flagpole, with\nat least the height of the flag between the top of the flag and the top of the\nflagpole. Flags cannot be flown at half-mast on poles that are more than 45\u00b0\nfrom the vertical, but a mourning cravat can be used instead (see below).\n\nWhen a flag is to be flown at half-mast, it should first be raised all the way\nto the top of the mast, allowed to remain there for a second and then be\nlowered to the half-mast position. When it is being lowered from half-mast, it\nshould again be raised to the top of the mast for a second before being fully\nlowered.\n\nWhen a British national flag is at half-mast, other flags on the same stand of\npoles should also be at half-mast or should not be flown at all. Flags of\nforeign nations should not be flown, unless their country is also observing\nmourning.\n\nThe Royal Standard never flies at half-mast. It represents the Monarchy, which\nis continuous, and it would therefore be inappropriate for it to fly at half-\nmast.\n\nFlags should be flown at half-mast on the following occasions:\n\n  1. From the announcement of the death until the funeral of the Sovereign, except on Proclamation Day when flags are flown at full-mast following the proclamation.\n  2. From the announcement of the death until the funeral of a member of the Royal Family styled \u2018Royal Highness\u2019, subject to special commands from the Sovereign in each case.\n  3. On the day of the announcement of the death and on the day of the funeral of other members of the Royal Family, subject to special commands from the Sovereign in each case.\n  4. The funerals of foreign Rulers, subject to special commands from the Sovereign in each case.\n  5. The funerals of Prime Ministers and ex-Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom, subject to special commands from the Sovereign in each case.\n  6. The funerals of First Ministers and ex-First Ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, subject to special commands from the Sovereign in each case. Unless otherwise commanded by the Sovereign, this only applies to flags in their respective countries.\n  7. At British Embassies, High Commissions and Missions when flags in the host country are flown at half-mast, subject to the discretion of the Chef de Mission.\n  8. Any other occasions where the Sovereign has given a special command.\n\nIf the body of a very distinguished citizen is lying in a building, the flag\nshould fly at half-mast on that building until the body has left.\n\nA Stand of Flags at Full-mast\n\nThe Same Stand at Half-mast\n\nAn alternative mark of mourning, used when half-masting is unsuitable, is to\nadd a black cravat or ribbon to the top of the flag, at the hoist.\n\nThe above cover Royal and National Mourning, but flags may be flown at half-\nmast on private or non-Government buildings on other relevant occasions. Flags\nfly at full-mast on Remembrance Sunday.\n\nMourning Cravats\n\n### The Proper Disposal of Flags\n\nWhen a flag becomes tattered or faded and is no longer in a suitable condition\nfor use, it should be destroyed in a dignified way, for example by burning,\ntearing or cutting into strips that no longer resemble the original flag.\n\n#### Footnotes\n\n[1] See Hansard \u2013 House of Lords Debate 14 July 1908 vol 192 cc 579 \u2013 80.\n\n[2] See www.opsi.gov.uk/Sr/sr2000/nisr_20000347_en.pdf &\nwww.opsi.gov.uk/Sr/sr2002/20020023.htm\n\n[3] International protocol prohibits the flying of any nation\u2019s flag higher\nthan another (apart from at medal ceremonies during sporting events).\n\n[4] If each country\u2019s official dimensions are being used, any of the flags\nthat are square or nearly square can have a slightly larger width (up to 25%\nmore) to give a more equal area.\n\n[5] Ensigns are the national flags that identify a vessel\u2019s nationality and in\nthe UK have the Union Flag in the top corner.\n\n### Appendix A \u2013 British Flags\n\nA selection of the principal flags of the United Kingdom, British Overseas\nTerritories and Crown Dependencies:\n\nUnion Flag\n\nEngland\n\nScotland\n\nWales\n\nAlderney\n\nAnguilla\n\nBermuda\n\nBritish Antarctic Territory\n\nBritish Indian Ocean Territory\n\nBritish Virgin Islands\n\nCayman Islands\n\nFalkland Islands\n\nGibraltar\n\nGuernsey\n\nIsle of Man\n\nJersey\n\nMontserrat\n\nPitcairn Islands\n\nSaint Helena\n\nSark\n\nSouth Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands\n\nTristan da Cunha\n\nTurks and Caicos Islands\n\nWhite Ensign (Royal Navy)\n\nRoyal Air Force Ensign\n\nRed Ensign (Merchant Navy)\n\nCivil Jack\n\nBlue Ensign (Royal Fleet Auxiliary)\n\nBritish Army (Non-Ceremonial)\n\nDiplomatic Service Flag (eg.

A\ncouple of examples: the Taiwan flag may cause offence to representatives of\nthe People\u2019s Republic of China; and the North Cyprus flag may cause offence to\nrepresentatives of Cyprus and Greece. If you are planning to fly either of\nthese flags it is worth checking who will be attending.\n\n#### English Alphabetical Order\n\nTo help with international flag displays, the nations of the world are listed\nhere in the normal English alphabetical order. The order uses the short name\nof the country rather than its formal name (ie. \u2018Australia\u2019 rather than\n\u2018Commonwealth of Australia\u2019) and ignores \u2018The\u2019. Some of the names that might\nnot be familiar are: Congo-Brazzaville \u2013 the former French colony of Congo;\nCongo-Kinshasa \u2013 the former Belgian Congo, now formally called the Democratic\nRepublic of Congo; and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire \u2013 the Ivory Coast.\n\nThe countries marked with an asterix (*) are British (the constituent\ncountries of the UK, the Crown Dependencies and the British Overseas\nTerritories); for displays of flags within these countries, dependencies or\nterritories, the local national flag takes precedence immediately after the\nUnion Flag and before any British ensigns (White, RAF, Red, Blue and Civil\nAir). The remainder should be displayed in alphabetical order as shown, with\nthe countries that make up the United Kingdom taking precedence.\n\nCountries marked with a dagger symbol (\u2020) are dependencies of other nations.\n\nUnited Kingdom England* Scotland* Wales* Alderney* Anguilla* Bermuda* British\nAntarctic Territory* British Indian Ocean Territory* British Virgin Islands*\nCayman Islands* Falkland Islands* Gibraltar* Guernsey* Isle of Man* Jersey*\nMontserrat* Pitcairn Islands* Saint Helena* Sark* South Georgia and the South\nSandwich Islands* Tristan da Cunha* Turks and Caicos Islands* Afghanistan\nAlbania Algeria American Samoa\u2020 Andorra Angola Antigua and Barbuda Argentina\nArmenia Aruba\u2020 Australia Austria Azerbaijan Bahamas, The Bahrain Bangladesh\nBarbados Belarus Belgium Belize Benin Bhut\u00e1n Bolivia Bosnia and Herzegovina\nBotswana Brazil Brunei Darusalam Bulgaria Burkina Faso Burma Burundi Cambodia\nCameroon Canada Cape Verde Central African Republic Chad Chile China Christmas\nIsland\u2020 Colombia Comoros Congo-Brazzaville Congo-Kinshasa (DR) Cook Islands\u2020\nCosta Rica C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire Croatia Cuba Cyprus Czech Republic Denmark Djibouti\nDominica Dominican Republic Ecuador Egypt El Salvador Equatorial Guinea\nEritrea Estonia Eswatini (Swaziland) Ethiopia Faroe Islands\u2020 Fiji Finland\nFrance French Polynesia\u2020 Gabon Gambia, The Georgia Germany Ghana Greece\nGreenland\u2020 Grenada Guam\u2020 Guatemala Guinea Guinea-Bissau Guyana Haiti Honduras\nHong Kong SAR\u2020 Hungary Iceland India Indonesia Ir\u00e2n Iraq Ireland Israel Italy\nJamaica Japan\n\nJordan Kazakhstan Kenya Kiribati Kosovo Kuwait Kyrgyzstan Laos Latvia Lebanon\nLesotho Liberia Libya Liechtenstein Lithuania Luxembourg Macau SAR\u2020 Madagascar\nMalawi Malaysia Maldives Mali Malta Marshall Islands Mauritania Mauritius\nM\u00e9xico Micronesia Moldova Monaco Mongolia Montenegro Morocco Mozambique\nNamibia Nauru Nepal Netherlands, The Netherlands Antilles\u2020 New Zealand\nNicaragua Niger Nigeria Niue\u2020 Norfolk Island\u2020 North Korea North Macedonia\nNorthern Marianas\u2020 Norway Oman Pakistan Palau Panam\u00e1 Papua New Guinea Paraguay\nPer\u00fa Philippines Poland Portugal Puerto Rico\u2020 Qatar Rom\u00e2nia Russian Federation\nRwanda Saint Kitts and Nevis Saint Lucia Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\nSamoa San Marino S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe Saudi Arabia Senegal Serbia Seychelles\nSierra Leone Singapore Slovakia Slovenia Solomon Islands Somalia South Africa\nSouth Korea South Sudan Spain Sri Lanka Sudan Suriname Sweden Switzerland\nSyria Taiwan Tajikistan Tanzania Thailand Timor Leste Togo Tokelau\u2020 Tonga\nTrinidad and Tobago Tunisia T\u00fcrkiye (Turkey) Turkmenistan Tuvalu Uganda\nUkraine United Arab Emirates United States of America Uruguay Uzbekistan\nVanuatu Vatican City Venezuela Vi\u00eat Nam Virgin Islands\u2020 Yemen Zambia Zimbabwe\n\n#### Footnotes\n\n[6] Only one Royal Standard is normally flown, and the order of precedence is:\nThe Royal Standard of HM The King, The Personal Flags of HM The Queen, HRH The\nPrince of Wales and Duke of Rothesay, HRH The Duke of York, HRH The Duke of\nEdinburgh, HRH The Princess Royal, HRH The Duke of Gloucester, HRH The Duke of\nKent, HRH Prince Michael of Kent, HRH Princess Alexandra, The Other Members\u2019\nStandard.\n\n[7] When these ensigns are flown in place of the Union Flag they take the same\nprecedence as the Union Flag.\n\n### Appendix C \u2013 United Kingdom Flag Specifications\n\nThe normal proportions for the national flags of the United Kingdom are 3:5 on\nland, but ensigns are customarily made in proportion 1:2.\n\n### Join or renew online\n\n### Search this website\n\n### Flag Days\n\nApr\n\n23\n\nTue\n\n2024\n\nall-day England: St George\u2019s Day\n\nEngland: St George\u2019s Day\n\nApr 23 all-day\n\nSt George\u2019s Day is England\u2019s national day \u2013 St George was named as England\u2019s\nprincipal patron saint in 1416.
