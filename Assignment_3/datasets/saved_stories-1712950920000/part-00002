Now\nthe World Health Organization has declared the antimicrobial resistance crisis\nas one of the top 10 global public health threats.\n\nWhen an infection is treated repeatedly, clinicians run the risk of bacteria\nbecoming resistant to the antibiotics. But why would an infection return after\nproper antibiotic treatment? One well-documented possibility is that the\nbacteria are becoming metabolically inert, escaping detection of traditional\nantibiotics that only respond to metabolic activity. When the danger has\npassed, the bacteria return to life and the infection reappears.\n\n\"Resistance is happening more over time, and recurring infections are due to\nthis dormancy,\" says Jackie Valeri, a former MIT-Takeda Fellow (centered\nwithin the MIT Abdul Latif Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health) who\nrecently earned her Ph.D. in biological engineering from the Collins Lab.\nValeri is the first author of a recent paper published in Cell Chemical\nBiology that demonstrates how machine learning could help screen compounds\nthat are lethal to dormant bacteria.\n\nTales of bacterial \"sleeper-like\" resilience are hardly news to the scientific\ncommunity\u2014ancient bacterial strains dating back to 100 million years ago have\nbeen discovered in recent years alive in an energy-saving state on the\nseafloor of the Pacific Ocean.\n\nMIT Jameel Clinic's Life Sciences faculty lead James J. Collins, a Termeer\nProfessor of Medical Engineering and Science in MIT's Institute for Medical\nEngineering and Science and Department of Biological Engineering, recently\nmade headlines for using AI to discover a new class of antibiotics, which is\npart of the group's larger mission to use AI to dramatically expand the\nexisting antibiotics available.\n\nAccording to a paper published by The Lancet, in 2019, 1.27 million deaths\ncould have been prevented had the infections been susceptible to drugs, and\none of many challenges researchers are up against is finding antibiotics that\nare able to target metabolically dormant bacteria.\n\n00:00\n\n-00:08\n\nStill from a time-lapse microscopy video of E. coli cells treated with\nsemapimod in the presence of SYTOX Blue. Credit: Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology\n\nIn this case, researchers in the Collins Lab employed AI to speed up the\nprocess of finding antibiotic properties in known drug compounds. With\nmillions of molecules, the process can take years, but researchers were able\nto identify a compound called semapimod over a weekend, thanks to AI's ability\nto perform high-throughput screening.\n\nSemapimod is an anti-inflammatory drug typically used for Crohn's disease, and\nresearchers discovered that it was also effective against stationary-phase\nEscherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumannii.\n\nAnother revelation was semapimod's ability to disrupt the membranes of so-\ncalled \"gram-negative\" bacteria, which are known for their high intrinsic\nresistance to antibiotics due to their thicker, less-penetrable outer\nmembrane.\n\nExamples of gram-negative bacteria include E. coli, A. baumannii, Salmonella,\nand Pseudomonis, all of which are challenging to find new antibiotics for.\n\n\"One of the ways we figured out the mechanism of sema [sic] was that its\nstructure was really big, and it reminded us of other things that target the\nouter membrane,\" Valeri explains. \"When you start working with a lot of small\nmolecules ... to our eyes, it's a pretty unique structure.\"\n\nBy disrupting a component of the outer membrane, semapimod sensitizes Gram-\nnegative bacteria to drugs that are typically only active against gram-\npositive bacteria.\n\nValeri recalls a quote from a 2013 paper published in Trends Biotechnology:\n\"For Gram-positive infections, we need better drugs, but for Gram-negative\ninfections we need any drugs.\"\n\nMore information: Erica J.
