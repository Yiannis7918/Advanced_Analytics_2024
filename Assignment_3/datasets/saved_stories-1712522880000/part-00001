Slovinsk\u00fd\n\nScientists have analyzed the first batch of data from the Dark Energy\nSpectroscopic Instrument's quest to map the universe and unravel the mysteries\nof dark energy.\n\nWith 5,000 tiny robots in a mountaintop telescope, the Dark Energy\nSpectroscopic Instrument (DESI) allows researchers to gaze 11 billion years\ninto the past. The light from far-flung objects in space is just now reaching\nDESI, enabling scientists to map the cosmos as it was in its youth while also\ntracing its growth. Understanding how the universe has evolved is tied to one\nof the biggest mysteries in physics: dark energy, which researchers\nhypothesize is driving the universe's expansion.\n\nDESI is an international science collaboration involving more than 800\nscientists from around the globe. Among them are researchers from the\nUniversity of Rochester's cosmology group, an interdisciplinary group that\nincludes professors, postdoctoral research associates, graduate students, and\nundergraduates from physics, astronomy, data science, and computer science.\nThe group is co-led by Regina Demina, a professor of physics; Segev BenZvi, an\nassociate professor of physics; and Kelly Douglass, an assistant professor of\nphysics and astronomy (instructional).\n\nDESI is currently in the midst of a five-year quest to measure 40 million\ngalaxies and quasars and create the largest 3D map of the cosmos ever\nconstructed, with the most precise measurements to date. The instrument began\nits survey in 2021, and researchers recently announced their analysis of the\nfirst year of collected data, including measurements of the expansion rate and\ncomposition of the universe. They published their analysis in multiple papers\non the arXiv preprint server.\n\n\"The DESI data is an enormous increase in size over anything that we've\ncollected before,\" Douglass says. \"DESI's year-one sample of galaxies and\nquasars is already six times larger than the combined measurements of all\nprevious spectroscopic surveys conducted over the last 40 years.\"\n\nAnd the year-one data is just the beginning, Demina adds, \"The full dataset\nwill enable us to take a closer look at the very dawn of our universe\u2014a period\nwhen the universe went through a rapid exponential expansion.\"\n\n## Optical eyes on the skies\n\nThe DESI instrument resides at the retrofitted Mayall Telescope at the\nNational Science Foundation's Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson,\nArizona. The instrument incorporates optics that increase the field of view of\nthe telescope and includes 5,000 robotically controlled optical fibers to\ngather spectroscopic data from objects in the telescope's field of view and\nsurvey the three-dimensional positions of galaxies and quasars in the\nuniverse.\n\nUniversity of Rochester PhD student Zack Brown completed a shift at Kitt Peak\nNational Observatory in Arizona in October 2023.

Credit: Ann Elliott, Ohio State University\n\nThe Rochester group has been part of DESI since 2017. Group members played key\nroles in commissioning and operating the instrument, including developing and\ntroubleshooting software to ensure the 5,000 fibers are optimally pointed at\ntheir targets.\n\nRochester group members also significantly contributed to validating the year-\none data, including studying systematic uncertainties\u2014potential errors or\nvariations\u2014that could affect the measurements, to better ensure the accuracy\nand reliability of the findings.\n\n## Decoding the universe's expansion\u2014and dark energy\n\nDESI is built to measure baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO)\u2014huge bubble-like\nstructures that galaxies follow, formed by conditions shortly after the Big\nBang. In its first year, DESI used 5.7 million galaxies and quasars from its\nspectroscopic sample to measure the size of the BAO and estimate how fast the\nuniverse is expanding, a quantity known as Hubble's Constant.\n\nThe BAO are also used to constrain the densities of dark matter and dark\nenergy. Scientists long believed the universe was expanding at a constant\nrate, but in 1999 the expansion rate was found to be accelerating. Dark energy\nis hypothesized to be driving the acceleration.\n\nSome theories suggest that one or more scalar fields (invisible forces that\nexpand the universe), similar to the scalar field hypothesized to drive the\ninflationary growth of the universe shortly after the Big Bang, contribute to\ndark energy.\n\n\"So far, only one scalar field is known to humankind\u2014the Higgs field,\" says\nDemina, who was part of the team that discovered the Higgs field in 2012 using\nthe Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland. \"Now is the time to check if\nthere are more such fields.\"\n\nAnother question DESI seeks to answer is whether dark energy has a constant\nvalue everywhere in the universe\u2014known as a cosmological constant\u2014or if its\nproperties differ in time and space. While DESI's year-one BAO measurements\nare compatible with a cosmological constant, they slightly favor a model that\nsuggests dark energy is an evolving or \"dynamical\" field.\n\nAccording to BenZvi, \"The evidence in favor of evolving dark energy could be\nvery interesting, but it could also be a chance fluctuation. We can't be sure\nuntil we look at the next batch of data. The current estimate is late 2025 for\nthe next release.\"\n\nMore information: DESI papers: data.desi.lbl.gov/doc/papers/\n\nJournal information: arXiv\n\nProvided by University of Rochester\n\nCitation: DESI first-year data delivers unprecedented measurements of\nexpanding universe (2024, April 6) retrieved 7 April 2024 from\nhttps://phys.org/news/2024-04-desi-year-unprecedented-universe.html\n\nThis document is subject to copyright.
