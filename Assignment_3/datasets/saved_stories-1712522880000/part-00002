(Howard Kingsnorth/Getty Images)\n\nCity planners aren't doctors. They don't have to consider how cancer grows and\nspreads to do their job. But perhaps they should.\n\nA new study suggests that large cities, like London and Sydney, grow oddly\nsimilarly to malignant tumors. Researchers argue that the same key factors\nthat govern the growth of cancer also seem to govern the spread of urban\nspaces.\n\nThe team led by urban climate scientist Isabella Capel-Timms at University\nCollege London (UCL) says understanding that similarity could help us build\nbetter cities for the future.\n\nOver the past 180 years, mathematical models show the British capital has\nrapidly swelled in size to become the sprawling metropolis we know today.\n\nThe original city of London that existed during the Middle Ages is known as\nthe 'square mile'. All of modern London is now more than 600 times the size of\nthat historical 'nucleus'.\n\nTo reach such enormous proportions, the capital grew like cancer between 1831\nand 2011. Mathematical models show that before the advent of the city's\nrailway network, London's population was clustered in a small, central area.\nLong-distance travel to the fringes was expensive and difficult.\n\nThe use of trains, however, permitted a shift to suburban living, allowing\nresidents to live further and further out from the center.\n\nThis seems to be a trend in other cities of the world, too: People tend to\nlike living in lower-density areas if transportation to a central area is\navailable.\n\nSuch dynamics, the international team of researchers argue, are comparative to\nhow blood vessels in cancerous tumors sprout and split, forging new 'roads'\ninto emerging tissue.\n\nThis process, called angiogenesis, allows cancer to grow more than just a few\nmillimeters in size; the blood vessels deliver oxygen and nutrients to cells\nfurther than diffusion could.\n\nThe same principle appears to hold true for many major cities around the\nworld, such as London, Washington DC, Paris, and Sydney \u2013 and for different\npublic transport systems other than trains.\n\nWhen scientists at UCL teamed up with researchers at the University of Sydney,\nthey found that the Australian harbor city grew in a similar way to London.\nUsing data from 1851 to 2011, Sydney's rail system and its urban population\nevolved side by side in models.\n\nLike London, the two biggest factors that seemed to govern the Australian\ncity's growth were the mass of its population and its interconnectedness.\nThese are the same factors that govern the growth of cancerous tissue.\n\nToday, the world is experiencing \"accelerated urbanization and\ndigitalization,\" the authors of the study explain, where cities are \"generally\ntreated as large machines or logistic systems that can be controlled by top-\ndown interventions.\"\n\nBut in reality, they argue, cities \"behave like complex adaptive systems which\nevolve \u2013 to a certain extent \u2013 like living organisms.\"\n\nThis isn't a new analogy \u2013 architects and scientists have made the comparison\nbefore \u2013 but the new study does provide quantitative comparisons between urban\nand biological growth that could prove useful.\n\nThe team hopes that city planners will look to the field of biology for future\nsolutions.\n\n\"For example,\" they suggest, \"policies aimed at regulating the development of\nroad, metro and railway networks may constrain future urban growth patterns in\na similar manner as strategies aimed at controlling vascularization and cell-\nto-cell interactions can mitigate cancer growth.\"\n\nThe study was published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface.\n\nTrending News\n\nVenting Doesn't Reduce Anger, But Something Else Does, Study Finds Humans6\ndays ago\n\nThe Polar Vortex Has Shifted Into Reverse \u2013 And Is Now Spinning Backwards\nEnvironment2 days ago\n\nRare Genetic Variants Are Curiously Connected With Being Left-Handed Humans5\ndays ago\n\n", "frontpage": false}
