Also,\nwhy does it feel like I could get fired for asking this?\u201d\n\nThanks for reading Santiago Pliego! Subscribe for free to receive new posts\nand support my work.\n\nA screenshot of Damore\u2019s own tl;dr at the beginning of the memo.\n\nHe was, of course, fired less than three months later for \u201c[advancing]\nincorrect assumptions about gender\u201d and for raising a perspective that \u201cis not\na viewpoint that I or this company endorses, promotes, or encourages,\u201d1 said\nDanielle Browne, Google\u2019s VP of Diversity, Integrity, and Governance.\n\nWhat struck me the most in revisiting his story is that this happened at the\nend of 2017. In my mind, this was something that happened circa 2012\u2014at least\nor nearly a decade ago, with enough time for the Overton Window to collapse to\nthe point where this kind of discussion is now ubiquitous on X and in other\nplaces.\n\nHad he waited for the Vibe Shift, Damore could have posted the above tl;dr to\na receptive audience of tens of millions:\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say exactly how long it\u2019s taken for the eponymous vibe to shift,\nbut everyone knows it\u2019s happening. For at least the last six months, not a day\nhas gone by when I haven\u2019t seen something, heard a statement, read a post, or\nhad a conversation with someone that doesn\u2019t leave me completely shocked\u2014in a\ngood way.\n\n\u201cThis would not have happened a year ago. Vibe shift.\u201d\n\nThe Vibe Shift I\u2019m talking about is the speaking of previously unspeakable\ntruths, the noticing of previously suppressed facts. I\u2019m talking about the\ngive you feel when the walls of Propaganda and Bureaucracy start to move as\nyou push; the very visible dust kicked up in the air as Experts and Fact\nCheckers scramble to hold on to decaying institutions; the cautious but\nelectric rush of energy when dictatorial edifices designed to stifle\ninnovation, enterprise, and thought are exposed or toppled.\n\nFundamentally, the Vibe Shift is a return to\u2014a championing of\u2014Reality, a\nrejection of the bureaucratic, the cowardly, the guilt-driven; a return to\ngreatness, courage, and joyous ambition.\n\nIt is best exemplified by this meme I made in my viral response against Paul\nGraham\u2019s explanation for why young men are overwhelmingly more conservative\nand young women overwhelmingly more liberal. When he argued that this trend\nhas a \u201cboringly obvious\u201d explanation (basically \u201cboys and girls don\u2019t spend as\nmuch time together anymore\u201d), I took a different approach:\n\nBoys in red, girls in blue.\n\nAs a society, is much easier to be detached from reality if you\u2019re sloshing\naround the SaaS casino of the 2010s, where things are easy and you can\ngenerate life-changing money by shipping the 10th notetaking app of the year\nor posting on Instagram. It\u2019s much safer to keep your mouth shut about The\nCurrent Thing\u2014no matter how insane\u2014if the alternative is to have your life\ndestroyed.\n\nBut we do not live in either easy or safe times, and as the cultural,\ntechnical, and political stakes get higher, a stoical \u201cjust keep your mouth\nshut\u201d attitude\u2014surprise!\u2014just doesn\u2019t cut it.\n\nAs Isaiah Berlin writes,\n\n> \u201cThis [a cowardly retreat towards the inward] is certainly what happened in\n> Ancient Greece when Alexander the Great began to destroy the city-States,\n> and the Stoics and the Epicureans began to preach a new morality of personal\n> salvation, which took the form of saying that politics was unimportant,\n> civil life was unimportant, all the great ideals held up by Pericles and by\n> Demosthenes, by Plato and Aristotle, were trivial and as nothing before the\n> imperative need for personal individual salvation.\u201d2\n\nMost folks in the tech and venture orbits are probably aware of the most\nsalient example of the vibe shift in startups: the happenings in The Gundo.\nThe tl;dr on the Gundo is a bunch of bright, young, ultra-ambitious dudes in\nEl Segundo, CA have forsaken the \u201cdon\u2019t rock the boat by saying what you\nbelieve and focus on hitting the SaaS jackpot\u201d ethos of 2010-2020s Silicon\nValley and are instead unapologetically pro-America, pro-family values, openly\nreligious, all of which they channel into challenging and important missions\nlike manufacturing hydrocarbons out of thin air, making it rain where it\ndoesn't, and more generally \u201crebuilding America.\u201d\n\nBut part of what is causing the Vibe Shift is that it goes well beyond the\nGundo: indeed, no matter what circles you run in, almost everyone\u2014from AI\naccelerationists to techbros to gun owners to Bitcoiners to Christians to\nnormal families to children who like math to American citizens\u2014is undergoing a\nvariation of the same kind of pressure to conform, stagnate, decelerate.\n\nNot only does the Current Thing demand total and unquestioning loyalty from\nall of these groups, but not even a year and a half ago anyone willing to\nspeak out could be barred from participating in the public square, forever.\n\nAnd then, Elon freed the bird.\n\nAs Mike Solana recently wrote,\n\n> \u201cFor over twenty years it\u2019s been obvious the internet doomed the 20th\n> Century media oligopoly. But it took decades for a majority of Americans to\n> move online, and in 2016, at precisely the moment it seemed social media\n> would replace the former order, an unofficial alliance of powers refortified\n> an elitist hold on discourse. A year ago, Elon shattered that alliance. The\n> thought criminals were freed, and the window of acceptable discourse\n> broadened until it broke \u2014 a total Overton collapse. Now, for better and for\n> worse, there is no more curation, there are no more fake trends, there are\n> no more Washington Post-employed state sock puppets propped up artificially,\n> and there is no more political censorship. Yes, whatever Elon finds\n> personally annoying tends to vanish (R.I.P. Substack links), and he\u2019s still\n> not been tested by a major election. But, for now at least, news trends are\n> dominated by stories people actually care about (even when they suck). This\n> has never happened before, and so the phenomenon necessarily poses\n> opportunity that has never before existed.\u201d [emphasis mine].\n\nIt is hard to overstate how much Elon\u2019s purchase of Twitter has accelerated\n(and perhaps directly caused) the Vibe Shift. The old ways of cutting and\nslicing the world have broken down, and now the most unexpected groups have\nfound themselves as co-belligerents in an existential war to preserve our\nability to speak, compute, build, worship, transact, and live in peace.\n\nAnd thus\u2014cutting across communities and denominations and occupations and\nhobbies\u2014we get to the Vibe Shift:\n\nThe Vibe Shift looks like ditching childless civilizational nihilism and\nsaying, yeah, having kids is good, actually.\n\nThe Vibe Shift is the repudiation of homogenizing hyperglobalism and instead\nintentionally pursuing the communal, the local, and the national.\n\nThe Vibe Shift is the rejection of reality denial and instead embracing that\nmen and women are unique and different.\n\nThe Vibe Shift is the refusal to subordinate yourself and your family to the\nwhims and anxieties of activists and bureaucrats and relearning to trust your\neyes and ears.\n\nThe Vibe Shift is the rejection of secular liberal materialism and a return to\nthe Christian foundations of the West.\n\nThe Vibe Shift is taking off the ironic veil that aims to cover the festering\nwounds of despair and putting on the vestments of seriousness instead.\n\nThe Vibe Shift is laughing at those trying to demonize men and cheerfully\nproclaiming \u201cDudes rock.\u201d\n\nThe Vibe Shift is spurning the fake and therapeutic and reclaiming the\nauthentic and concrete.\n\nThe Vibe Shift is a healthy suspicion of credentialism and a return to human\njudgment.\n\nThe Vibe Shift is living not by lies, and instead speaking the truth\u2014whatever\nthe cost.\n\nThe Vibe Shift is directly facing our tumultuous times, refusing to blackpill,\nand choosing to build instead.\n\nThere is no denying that whatever else, the Vibe Shift is an electric\ntime\u2014after all, things hidden before the foundation of the world are being\nrediscovered, and things thought to last until the end of time are crumbling\nat hypersonic speeds.\n\nIt is also a time fraught with opportunities for new, disruptive technology.\nIt doesn\u2019t surprise me that as we enter what could very well be the most\nvolatile political and cultural period in recent American history we\u2019re also\nseeing some of the boldest bets of the last few decades. The printing press\nemerged\u2014as if by chance\u2014amid the most apocalyptic geopolitical and cultural\nrearrangement of Europe since the Great Schism of 1054. In a time charged with\nexplosive tension and excuses for violent conflict, a new technology gave the\nReformers a strategic, non-coercive lever against the status quo, with various\nhistorians almost singlehandedly crediting the success of the Protestant\nReformation to such a device. Closer to home, the age of American Westward\nexpansion accelerated with the aid of technologies that the frontier itself\ninspired: from 1830 to 1895, the photograph, the telegraph, the rotary power\nprinter, the typewriter, the transatlantic cable, the telephone, the motion\npicture wireless signals, and other now-ubiquitous technologies emerged to\nhelp advance civilization past a kind of topographic-political gridlock and\ninto a new era of possibility and abundance.3\n\nFundamentally, the Vibe Shift is a time for real courage. Like Tim O\u2019Brien\u2019s\nmain character in \u201cOn the Rainy River,\u201d we\u2019ve indulged in cowardice for too\nlong:\n\n> \u201cAll of us, I suppose, like to believe that in a moral emergency we will\n> behave like the heroes of our youth, bravely and forthrightly, without\n> thought of personal loss or discredit. Certainly that was my conviction back\n> in the summer of 1968. [...] If the stakes ever became high enough\u2014if the\n> evil were evil enough, if the good were good enough\u2014I would simply tap a\n> secret reservoir of courage that had been accumulating inside me over the\n> years. Courage, I seemed to think, comes to us in finite quantities, like an\n> inheritance, and by being frugal and stashing it away and letting it earn\n> interest, we steadily increase our moral capital in preparation for that day\n> when the account must be drawn down. It was a comforting theory. It\n> dispensed with all those bothersome little acts of daily courage; it offered\n> hope and grace to the repetitive coward; it justified the past while\n> amortizing the future.\u201d4\n\nWhether through self-immolation or disruption from technologies like AI, the\nold world of Ivy League diplomas and a carefully curated \u201ccolor inside the\nlines\u201d public image is passing away. In the new world, things like\ncourage\u2014things that cannot be faked, things that are really real\u2014are, perhaps\nfor a moment, \u201cproof of credibility\u201d for those who are actively and explicitly\nbuilding amid our decline and eager to leave a better future for our\nchildren\u2019s children.\n\nHow long this Vibe Shift lasts remains to be seen. It may be fleeting, though\nI hope it sticks around. However long it lasts, we must steward it. And so I\nleave you with the words of Nehemiah to the Israelites, as they faced\nopposition and threats from surrounding adversaries who sought to deter them\nfrom rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem:\n\n\u201cAnd I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and\nto the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them: remember the Lord, which\nis great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your\ndaughters, your wives, and your houses.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Santiago Pliego\n\n1\n\nhttps://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/08/google-fires-engineer-who-crossed-\nthe-line-with-diversity-memo/\n\n2\n\nIsaiah Berlin, \u201cThe Roots of Romanticism,\u201d 1965.\n\n3\n\nNeil Postman, \u201cTechnopoly,\u201d 1992.\n\n4\n\nTim O\u2019Brien, \u201cOn The Rainy River,\u201d in \u201cThe Things They Carried\u201d, 1990.\n\n362 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n68 Restacks\n\n362\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Vibe Shift\n\npliego.substack.com\n\n85\n\nShare\n\n85 Comments\n\nDeborah Tate22 hrs agoLiked by Santiago PliegoI caught your interview with\nTucker this morning then immediately read your post.

While Twitter\nfreedom did mark change in discourse, many of us had been drawn to SubStack as\na result of the excesses of the pandemic. Huge numbers then found the platform\nwhere alternate theories could be debated among the like minded and we were\nnot drowned out nor cancelled for thinking masks and other mitigation actions\nwere failing. It didn't help that media was going on daily with dire warnings\nwhich were beyond silly stoking fear in way too many - needless fear.So the\ndam broke when the public, at large, refused the boosters. They were\ndiscarding fear and were questioning the media dogma because they could\nobserve for themselves. And the voices within SubStack had become public\nknowledge.I can see the valiant effort on X to push J6 as a way to discredit\nTrump, but I suspect many now question the government's overreach. We do seem\nat a turning point where we are beginning to really distrust much of what the\nmedia is saying - perhaps because they repeatedly are found in error.We see\nCarlson't large audience and many tuning into alternative media, like\nNewsNation, for other opinions. While Fox News remains king, others are\nfailing to reach an audience. We are quite willing now to be contrarian in our\nviews and not worry so much about the nonsense among the foolish young on\ncampus. Hopefully this is a trend back to some cultural norm where we are\ncomfortable thinking for ourselves.Expand full commentLike (24)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n1 reply\n\n83 more comments...\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Santiago Pliego\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great writing\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
