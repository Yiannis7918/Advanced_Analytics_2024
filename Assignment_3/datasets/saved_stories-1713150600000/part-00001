To those who knew Bob, it will provoke warm memories to say\nthat he was not a language guy; he understood image, and story, and the\ndelicate way in which those elements should meet.\n\nBob spent a too-short lifetime on film sets, working beside real filmmakers \u2013\nScorsese, Bertolucci, Pakula, Levinson, Ang Lee \u2013 helping to shepherd the\nideas of many great directors and eschewing the limelight altogether for the\nchance. But, hey, if you don\u2019t believe me about how substantial his resume\nwas, go to imdb right now and trace the arc of his career. That he ended up\ntethered to some ex-police reporter in Baltimore was pure forbearance on his\npart; for my part, I can just say I got very lucky.\n\nIt is no exaggeration that Bob had to explain \u201ccrossing the line\u201d to me a\ndozen times, often twice in the same day, before my brain could grasp a\nconcept that first-year film students everywhere take for granted. If you go\nto the fourth episode of the first season of The Wire, and watch the\ncamerawork on that long scene with Freamon and McNulty in the bar, you\u2019ll be a\nbystander to the moment when the linear word-brain that I drag to set every\nday was finally allowed a few rays of cinematic light, courtesy of a patient\nmentor.\n\n\u201cSee what happens when we cross over and everything flips?\u201d he explained for\nthe thirteenth time. \u201cIf you see the move happen, you aren\u2019t disoriented, but\nif we were to cut that moment and then suddenly be on the other side...\u201d\n\nHe paused, looked at me. Nothing. Dead crickets.\n\n\u201cSo...the dialogue that they\u2019re saying when we cross the line and reverse on\nthem \u2013 those words \u2013we can\u2019t cut those. You good with that?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I get it now.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight. Then we\u2019re good.\u201d\n\nHuh. The next day, I sauntered up to Bob at the video monitors and, in my best\ndeadpan, asked him yet again to explain crossing the line. He looked on me\nsadly as a terminal case, until I started laughing. No, I had finally learned\nsomething about the camera and the credit was his. I just couldn\u2019t resist\npulling the man\u2019s coat one more time.\n\nIn telling that story on myself, I\u2019m trying to make clear that while I might\nhave learned to put film in the can in a basic way before the marriage to Mr.\nColesberry, I had no claim to anything remotely resembling a film auteur. It\nwas Bob who created the visual template for The Corner and The Wire both, and\nhaving died suddenly after the latter drama\u2019s second season, it is Bob who is\nremembered wistfully every time we begin to construct the visuals for some\nfresh narrative world. He would have reveled in Generation Kill, and knowing\nwhat I do about the visual palate that New Orleans offers the world, I am\nunsure that Bob Colesberry could have ever been pried from that city had he\ngone down there for Treme.\n\nAs devoted as he was to imagery and story, language was always a lesser\ncurrency in Bob\u2019s life; he often made his arguments elliptically, curling in\nsentence-fragment circles until he got to where he needed to go. You had to\nlean in and listen a little harder, but it was always worthwhile and he was\nusually correct when he got to his point. Once, at a TCA panel on The Wire,\nBob answered a reporter\u2019s question in vague terms and at length. To lighten\nthe moment, I tossed off a joke: \u201cNow you can see why Bob\u2019s in command of the\nvisuals.\u201d It was teasing and steeped in affection, but I regretted the remark\nas soon as I uttered it. Bob\u2019s contributions to the storytelling were\nprofound, and though he laughed it off, I had been heedless. His claim on The\nWire and what it was trying to do was genuine and elemental; for years, before\nand after his death, I wanted that moment back to exalt my friend and\ncolleague.\n\nSo when HBO sent out some promo ads about a conversion of The Wire to HD and a\n16:9 ratio a few months ago, I reacted not merely as David Simon, showrunner\nand ink-stained scribbler, but as David Simon, the medium for Robert\nColesberry, professional filmmaker. WWBD. What would Bob do?\n\n* * *\n\nWell, for one thing, he would make sure to be included in the process.\n\nNina Noble and I were told a year ago that HBO wanted to experiment with\ntaking The Wire, filmed in standard definition and a 4:3 ratio, to the new\nindustry standards. We endorsed the effort, but after we last spoke to folks\non the production side, we had expected to be shown some work recast in high\ndefinition and wider screen and to begin discussions at that point. Instead,\nwe heard nothing until on-air promos for The Wire in HD began to be broadcast\nand packaging material for a fresh release of the drama was forwarded to us in\nYonkers, where we are shooting our current HBO project.\n\nNo offense was taken, particularly when the production people explained that\nthe transfer to HD had been laborious and ornate, and it was simply assumed\nthat we were too busy with current production to dive into the process in\ndetail. And, too, there was a further assumption at HBO that as a transfer to\nHD could provide a fresh audience for the drama, there was no real\ndisincentive to an HD transfer of The Wire on any terms; if it could be done,\nthey reasoned, it should be done.\n\nAnd yet, I still had Bob Colesberry in my ear. Moreover, Bob\u2019s history with HD\nand a 16:9 ratio in regard to The Wire was a tortured one. His intentions, the\nlimitations imposed on our production, and his resulting template for the\ndrama were known to me, if not to the folks presently struggling with a\nretroactive transfer to HD and widescreen.\n\nIn fact, Bob had asked before filming The Wire pilot in late 2001 for a\nwidescreen aspect ratio. He correctly saw television screens growing wider and\n16:9 ratio becoming industry standard, and coming from the feature world, it\nwas his inclination to be as filmic as possible. But, to be honest, The Wire\nwas at its inception a bit of shoestring affair and expectations for the drama\nat HBO were certainly modest. Filming in letter-box was more expensive at the\ntime, and we were told, despite Bob\u2019s earnest appeals, that we should shoot\nthe pilot and the ensuing season in 4:3.\n\nAt which point, Bob set about to work with 4:3 as the given. And while we were\nfilming in 35mm and could have ostensibly \u201cprotected\u201d ourselves by adopting\nwider shot composition in the event of some future change of heart by HBO, the\nproblem with doing so is obvious: If you compose a shot for a wider 16:9\nscreen, then you are, by definition, failing to optimize the composition of\nthe 4:3 image. Choose to serve one construct and at times you must impair the\nother.\n\nBecause we knew the show would be broadcast in 4:3, Bob chose to maximize the\nstorytelling within that construct. As full wide shots in 4:3 rendered\nprotagonists smaller, they couldn\u2019t be sustained for quite as long as in a\nfeature film, but neither did we go running too quickly to close-ups as a\nconsequence. Instead, mid-shots became an essential weapon for Bob, and on\nthose rare occasions when he was obliged to leave the set, he would remind me\nto ensure that the director covered scenes with mid-sized shots that allowed\nus to effectively keep the story in the wider world, and to resist playing too\nmuch of the story in close shots.\n\nSimilarly, Bob further embraced the 4:3 limitation by favoring gentle camera\nmovements and a combination of track shots and hand-held work, implying a\ndocumentarian construct. If we weren\u2019t going to be panoramic and omniscient in\n4:3, then we were going to approach scenes with a camera that was intelligent\nand observant, but intimate. Crane shots didn\u2019t often help, and anticipating a\nmovement or a line of dialogue often revealed the filmmaking artifice. Better\nto have the camera react and acquire, coming late on a line now and then.\nBetter to have the camera in the flow of a housing-project courtyard or squad\nroom, calling less attention to itself as it nonetheless acquired the tale.\n\nIn the beginning, we tried to protect for letterbox, but by the end of the\nsecond season, our eyes were focused on the story that could be told using\n4:3, and we composed our shots to maximize a film style that suggested not the\nvistas of feature cinematography, but the capture and delicacy of\ndocumentarian camerawork. We got fancy at points, and whatever rules we had,\nwe broke them now and again; sometimes the results were a delight, sometimes\nless so. But by and large, Bob had shaped a template that worked for the\ndystopian universe of The Wire, a world in which the environment was\nformidable and constricting, and the field of vision for so many of our\ncharacters was limited and even contradictory.\n\nBob Colesberry died during surgery while we were prepping season three of the\ndrama. A short time later, HBO came to us with news that the world was going\nto HD and 16:9, as Bob had anticipated. We could, if we wanted, film the\nremaining seasons of The Wire in HD and widescreen. But at that point a\ncollective decision then was made to complete the project using the template\nthat we had honed, the construct that we felt we had used to good effect to\nmake the story feel more stolen than shaped, and to imply a more journalistic\nrendering of Baltimore than a filmic one.\n\nJust as important, we had conceived of The Wire as a single story that could\nstand on its own across the five seasons. To deliver the first two seasons in\none template and then to switch-up and provide the remaining seasons in\nanother format would undercut our purpose tremendously, simply by calling\nattention to the manipulation of the form itself. The whole story would become\nless real, and more obviously, a film that was suddenly being delivered in an\naltered aesthetic state. And story, to us, is more important than aesthetics.\n\nWe stayed put and honored what we had already created. As I believe Bob would\nhave, at that late point, stayed put.\n\n* * *\n\nAnd now comes HBO with the opportunity to deliver the story to a new audience.\n\nTo their great credit, once we alerted HBO production executives to our\nabsolute interest in the matter, they halted the fall HD release and allowed\nus to engage in detail. And over the past several months, looking at some of\nwhat the widescreen format offered, three things became entirely clear: First,\nthere were many scenes in which the shot composition is not impaired by the\ntransfer to 16:9, and there are a notable number of scenes that acquire real\nbenefit from playing wide. An example of a scene that benefits would be this\none, from the final episode of season two, when an apostolic semicircle of\nlongshoremen forms around the body of Frank Sobotka:\n\nFine as far as it goes, but the dockworkers are all that much more vulnerable,\nand that much more isolated by the death of their leader when we have the\nability to go wider in that rare crane shot:\n\nBut there are other scenes, composed for 4:3, that lose some of their purpose\nand power, to be sure. An early example that caught my eye is a scene from the\npilot episode, carefully composed by Bob, in which Wee Bey delivers to\nD\u2019Angelo a homily on established Barksdale crew tactics. \u201cDon\u2019t talk in the\ncar,\u201d D\u2019Angelo reluctantly offers to Wee Bey, who stands below a neon sign\nthat declares, \u201cburgers\u201d while D\u2019Angelo, less certain in his standing and\nperformance within the gang, stands beneath a neon label of \u201cchicken.\u201d\n\nThat shot composition was purposed, and clever, and it works better in the 4:3\nversion than when the screen is suddenly widened to pick up additional neon to\nthe left of Bey:\n\nIn such a case, the new aspect ratio\u2019s ability to acquire more of the world\nactually detracts from the intention of the scene and the composition of the\nshot. For that reason, we elected in the new version to go tighter on the key\ntwo-shot of Bey and D\u2019Angelo in order to maintain some of the previous\ncomposition, albeit while coming closer to our backlit characters than the\nscene requires:\n\nIt is, indeed, an arguable trade-off, but one that reveals the cost of taking\nsomething made in one construct and recasting it for another format. And this\nscene isn\u2019t unique; there are a good number of similar losses in the transfer,\nas could be expected.\n\nMore fundamentally, there were still, upon our review, a good hundred or so\nscenes in which the widening revealed sync problems with actors who would\notherwise have remained offscreen, or even the presence of crew or film\nequipment. These scenes, still evident in the version that HBO originally\nintended to broadcast several months ago, required redress. The high-\ndefinition transfer also made things such as Bubbles\u2019 dental work, or certain\ncomputer-generated images vulnerable; other stuff held up pretty well in the\ntransfer.\n\nThis is no poor reflection on HBO\u2019s initial efforts. In traversing 60 hours of\nfilm, the HBO production team had done a metric ton of work painting out\nC-stands and production assistants, as well as solving a good many sync\nproblems. They felt they had protected sufficiently to air the drama in HD and\nwidescreen several months ago. However, for myself and Nina \u2013 examining even a\nsmall portion of the whole and finding light flares and sync issues that could\nbe better corrected \u2013 we were confirmed in our need to slow the process and\ntake a last, careful look.\n\nUnfortunately, as we have spent the fall in production for HBO, there was no\nchance we could find time enough to attend to a complete review of the entire\nseries. That fell to a film editor in whom we place great trust and who knows\nthe The Wire well from his service to it over the years. Matthew Booras took\nthe notes and concerns of the surviving filmmakers into an editing suite and\nbegan making hard decisions about what we might live with, what we might\nimprove, and which choice did the least violence to the story when a scene\nbecame vulnerable. Narrowing the workload for Nina and myself, he made it\npossible for us to focus on the handful of essential problems in every\nepisode. The hard work here on our part should actually be credited to him.\n\nAt HBO, Rosalie Camarda managed the synthesis of our late notes with the film\nedit, and long before Matthew weighed in on the remaining problems, Laurel\nWarbrick capably performed the lion\u2019s share of the transfer, going scene by\nscene through the cuts and resizing and painting away problems throughout. The\ntwo then worked with Matthew, Nina and myself on the remaining issues, and we\nare grateful for their patience and commitment to the process.\n\nAt the last, I\u2019m satisfied what while this new version of The Wire is not, in\nsome specific ways, the film we first made, it has sufficient merit to exist\nas an alternate version. There are scenes that clearly improve in HD and in\nthe widescreen format. But there are things that are not improved. And even\nwith our best resizing, touchups and maneuver, there are some things that are\nsimply not as good. That\u2019s the inevitability: This new version, after all,\nexists in an aspect ratio that simply wasn\u2019t intended or serviced by the\nfilmmakers when the camera was rolling and the shot was framed.\n\nStill, being equally honest here, there can be no denying that an ever-greater\nportion of the television audience has HD widescreen televisions staring at\nthem from across the living room, and that they feel notably oppressed if all\nof their entertainments do not advantage themselves of the new hardware. It\nvexes them in the same way that many with color television sets were long ago\nbothered by the anachronism of black-and-white films, even carefully conceived\nblack-and-white films. For them, The Wire seems frustrating or inaccessible \u2013\neven more so than we intended it. And, hey, we are always in it to tell people\na story, first and foremost. If a new format brings a few more thirsty\ncritters to the water\u2019s edge, then so be it.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m going to choose to believe that Bob Colesberry would forgive\nthis trespass on what he built, and that he, too, would be more delighted at\nthe notion of more folks seeing his film than distressed at the imprecisions\nand compromises required. If there is an afterlife, though, I may hear a good\ndeal about this later. And in consideration of that possibility, I\u2019m going to\nask anyone who enjoys this new version of The Wire to join me in sending five\nor ten or twenty dollars to the following address:\n\nThe Robert F. Colesberry Scholarship\n\nTisch School For The Arts\n\nNew York University\n\n721 Broadway, 12th Floor\n\nNew York, N.Y. 10003\n\nAs I\u2019ve made clear, I\u2019ve messed with a Bob Colesberry template here, and the\nman, when passionate, spoke in long coils, building slowly and inexorably to a\nsummation. And yes, eternity is a long fucking time. So if you\u2019ve long wanted\nThe Wire in HD, unass a bit of coin for a scholarship that honors Bob and\nsupports future filmmakers in his name. You\u2019ll be doing me a small, karmic\nsolid.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nBaltimore, Md.\n\nDecember 1, 2014\n\n  * 2.7Kshares\n  * Share on Facebook\n  * Share on Twitter\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Reddit\n  * Email\n  * Print\n\n### 253 Comments\n\n  * Ron says:\n\nJune 3, 2022 at 10:54 am\n\nCan we get updated video/image links?

Thanks for all the hard work and sweating the headaches to\ngive us the best possible 16:9 version of something that was perfect.\n\nAs a filmmaker doing the dance to get his first feature made, all I can say is\nmy fervent hope is I get to make a film #2 and in it will be at least one alum\nfrom the Wire. I have my list, but I win whoever is the first one my budget\nand scheduling allows me to get.\n\nMy goal is to make period movies about the black middle class, Merchant/Ivory\nbut for us. I imagine Lance Reddick in a tux, or J.D. Williams in a three\npiece suit, or Sonia Sohn in a gown, each portraying a Striver, one the\ndoctors, lawyers, dentists, and teachers who were the core of black\ncommunities before they were blasted by indifference, redlining, abandoned\ninner cities and racism.\n\nThe Wire masterfully told what happened during the part of the tale that is\nnow, I hope one day to tell what happened fifty, sixty, even seventy years\nbefore the cities fell and we scattered to the winds.\n\nAnd one day, someone will finish the story and it will be how we rose and\npersevered.\n\nWe beat the Rebels, we beat the propaganda of Birth of a Nation, the re-birth\nof the Klan and its 50 year reign of terror and Hitler too, we beat Jim Crow,\nand by God we\u2019ll beat this too.\n\nI don\u2019t know what historians will call the period after WWII, during the time\nbetween black vet being cheated out of their G.I. Bill rights, Vietnam, Iraq\ntimes two, Reagan, the rise of the Right, the Drug War with prisons filled to\nbursting, and finally the crash of the economy.\n\nThe Wire will stand out as a chronicle of part of a story that\u2019s not done yet.\nPart of an epilog to a very long and terrible story that will not end with us\nquitting or giving in. Like the man said, \u201cRise up ye mighty race, accomplish\nwhat you will.\u201d\n\nReply\n\n    * South TX Man says:\n\nJune 13, 2015 at 8:10 pm\n\nI won\u2019t be satisfied until The Wire is scanned in 4K, cropped to 2:35 aspect\nratio, with 10.2 surround sound, Dolby Atmos encoded, and in 3D. Ahh WTF, lets\ndo it in IMAX as well!\n\nReply\n\n      * Donald says:\n\nOctober 27, 2015 at 2:39 pm\n\nMaybe its not that freaking necessary to put The Wire in today\u2019s tech\nstandards for those who already know it. But it is definitely the only way to\nget on the screens of the younger audience. Maybe some seeds will grow there\ninspite of the omnipresent banality-terror of the mainstream entertainment.\nAlso first homo sapiens sapiens felt a bit lonely after finding out that\nhe/she was, yeah, a little different...\n\nReply\n\n  * \u2018The Wire\u2019 creator David Simon explains why HD isn\u2019t always better | My Power Health says:\n\nJune 2, 2015 at 9:12 pm\n\n[...] producer David Simon has chimed in about what we can expect to see this\ntime around.

A definite boxset to get for one of\nthe best series ever made.!\n\nReply\n\n  * THE WIRE: THE COMPLETE SERIES - AndersonVision says:\n\nMay 26, 2015 at 3:27 pm\n\n[...] community. David Simon has made the case for moving from 4:3 to 1.78:1\nand it makes sense. Click here for the comparison shots from the actual show\ncreator.

There are subtleties which\nyou don\u2019t always pick up on the first time around. I\u2019ll be honest, I didn\u2019t\neven pick up on the burger/chicken thing. It would be a shame if some of these\nsubtleties are lost in translation, but apparently HBO did an amazing job.\n\nStill wondering about the significance of the train track where the Bunk and\nMcNulty write themselves off. I was watching it again earlier, I noticed that\nas well that when the Police high-command are reaming out the lower echelon\nabout crime-stats, Stan Valcheck has his foot rested on a metal pole,\nindicating to me, he\u2019s casual about this \u2013 he knows this shit isn\u2019t going to\naffect him.\n\nReply\n\n\u00ab Previous 1 2 3 4\n\n### Leave a Comment X\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
