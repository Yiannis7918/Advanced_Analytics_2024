Image: University of Sydney and Queensland University of Technology\n\nFrom robotic vacuum cleaners and smart fridges to baby monitors and delivery\ndrones, the smart devices being increasingly welcomed into our homes and\nworkplaces use vision to take in their surroundings, taking videos and images\nof our lives in the process.\n\nIn a bid to restore privacy, researchers at the Australian Centre for Robotics\nat the University of Sydney and the QUT Centre for Robotics (QCR) at\nQueensland University of Technology have created a new approach to designing\ncameras that process and scramble visual information before it is digitised so\nthat it becomes obscured to the point of anonymity.\n\nKnown as sighted systems, devices like autonomous vacuum cleaners form part of\nthe \u201cinternet-of-things\u201d \u2013 smart systems that connect to the internet. They\ncan be at risk of being hacked by bad actors or lost through human error,\ntheir images and videos at risk of being stolen by third parties, sometimes\nwith malicious intent.\n\nActing as a \"fingerprint,\u201d the distorted images can still be used by robots to\ncomplete their tasks but do not provide a comprehensive visual representation\nthat compromises privacy.\n\n\u201cSmart devices are changing the way we work and live our lives, but they\nshouldn\u2019t compromise our privacy and become surveillance tools,\u201d said Adam\nTaras, who completed the research as part of his Honours thesis.\n\n\u201cWhen we think of \u2018vision\u2019 we think of it like a photograph, whereas many of\nthese devices don\u2019t require the same type of visual access to a scene as\nhumans do. They have a very narrow scope in terms of what they need to measure\nto complete a task, using other visual signals, such as colour and pattern\nrecognition,\u201d he said.\n\n## What a normal camera sees VS what the privacy preserving camera sees\n\nThe researchers have been able to segment the processing that normally happens\ninside a computer within the optics and analogue electronics of the camera,\nwhich exists beyond the reach of attackers.\n\n\u201cThis is the key distinguishing point from prior work which obfuscated the\nimages inside the camera\u2019s computer \u2013 leaving the images open to attack,\u201d said\nDr Don Dansereau, Taras\u2019 supervisor at the Australian Centre for Robotics and\nDigital Sciences Initiative. \u201dWe go one level beyond to the electronics\nthemselves, enabling a greater level of protection.\u201d\n\nThe researchers tried to hack their approach but were unable to reconstruct\nthe images in any recognisable format. They have opened this task to the\nresearch community at large, challenging others to hack their method.\n\n\u201cIf these images were to be accessed by a third party, they would not be able\nto make much of them, and privacy would be preserved,\u201d said Taras.\n\nDr Dansereau said privacy was increasingly becoming a concern as more devices\ntoday come with built-in cameras, and with the possible increase in new\ntechnologies in the near future like parcel drones, which travel into\nresidential areas to make deliveries.\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want images taken inside your home by your robot vacuum cleaner\nleaked on the dark web, nor would you want a delivery drone to map out your\nbackyard. It is too risky to allow services linked to the web to capture and\nhold onto this information,\u201d said Dr Dansereau.\n\nThe approach could also be used to make devices that work in places where\nprivacy and security are a concern, such as warehouses, hospitals, factories,\nschools and airports.\n\nThe researchers hope to next build physical camera prototypes to demonstrate\nthe approach in practice.\n\n\u201cCurrent robotic vision technology tends to ignore the legitimate privacy\nconcerns of end-users. This is a short-sighted strategy that slows down or\neven prevents the adoption of robotics in many applications of societal and\neconomic importance. Our new sensor design takes privacy very seriously, and I\nhope to see it taken up by industry and used in many applications,\u201d said\nProfessor Niko Suenderhauf, Deputy Director of the QCR, who advised on the\nproject.\n\nProfessor Peter Corke, Distinguished Professor Emeritus and Adjunct Professor\nat the QCR who also advised on the project said: \u201cCameras are the robot\nequivalent of a person's eyes, invaluable for understanding the world, knowing\nwhat is what and where it is. What we don\u2019t want is the pictures from those\ncameras to leave the robot\u2019s body, to inadvertently reveal private or intimate\ndetails about people or things in the robot\u2019s environment.\u201d\n\nRESEARCH\n\nThe research, Inherently privacy-preserving vision for trustworthy autonomous\nsystems: Needs and solutions, was published by the Journal of Responsible\ntechnology.\n\nDECLARATION\n\nThe authors declare no competing interests.\n\n### Luisa Low\n\nMedia and PR Adviser (Engineering & IT)\n\nMobile\n\n  * +61 438 021 390\n\nEmail\n\n  * luisa.low@sydney.edu.au\n\n### Related news\n\nNews_\n\n03 April 2024\n\n### Five Sydney researchers honoured by Australian Academy of Science\n\nAustralian Academy of Science recognises outstanding work in geosciences,\nmathematics, solar energy research, biomedical engineering and applied\nbiological sciences.\n\nNews_\n\n04 March 2024\n\n### Nanothin printing of electronics hardware could slash costs\n\nEngineering researchers have developed a 2D printing process using liquid\nmetals that they say could create new ways of creating more advanced and\nenergy efficient computing hardware that is manufactured at the nanoscale.\n\nNews_\n\n25 January 2024\n\n### Centralised social networks potentially hinder innovation\n\nSocial systems where influence is centred around one or two individuals can\nlead to pack mentality and group think in farming communities, according to\nnew research.\n\nnext slide\n\nprevious slide\n\nWe recognise and pay respect to the Elders and communities - past, present,\nand emerging - of the lands that the University of Sydney's campuses stand on.\nFor thousands of years they have shared and exchanged knowledges across\ninnumerable generations for the benefit of all.\n\nLearn more\n\nUniversity of Sydney\n\nLeadership for good\n\n## Media\n\n  * Find an expert\n  * Media contacts\n\n## Student links\n\n  * How to log in to University systems\n  * Key dates\n  * Class timetables\n  * Policies\n\n## About us\n\n  * Our rankings\n  * Faculties and schools\n  * Research centres\n  * Campus locations\n\n## Connect\n\n  * Contact us\n  * Find a staff member\n  * Careers at Sydney\n  * Emergencies and personal safety\n  * Find an event\n\nGroup Of Eight APRU Athena Swan member\n\nDisclaimer Privacy Accessibility Website feedback\n\nABN: 15 211 513 464\n\nCRICOS Number: 00026A\n\nTEQSA: PRV12057\n\nWe use cookies to improve your experience on our site and to show you\npersonalised content.
