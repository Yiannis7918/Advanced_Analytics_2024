but gave no more details.\n\n\"Everything happened in silence... of course this is a clear political attack,\nthere is no doubt here,\" he added.\n\nKremlin officials declined to comment on the arrests during a news conference\non Friday.\n\nMr Volkov was briefly hospitalised after the attack, which took place as he\narrived at his Vilnius home by car on 12 March.\n\nPictures were posted on social media at the time, by another member of the\nNavalny team, showing Mr Volkov with bruising to his head and a bloodied leg.\nHe said he had been pepper sprayed and hit with a hammer multiple times.\n\nRussia's late opposition leader Alexei Navalny died suddenly in prison in the\nRussian Arctic in February.\n\nThis week, his widow Yulia Navalnaya said Mr Volkov's attack had prompted her\nto hire a bodyguard.\n\n\"Today they attacked Leonid, tomorrow they'll break into the house,\" she told\nTime magazine, adding that Mr Volkov's wife was in their home \"with their\nlittle kids\" at the time.\n\nMs Navalnaya said neither she nor her late husband used to have security, \"but\nwhen you're too cavalier, you can make a wrong move\".\n\n## Navalny ally blames Putin's men for hammer attack\n\nRussia\n\nLithuania\n\nAlexei Navalny\n\nRelated\n\n## US Congress close to passing long-awaited Ukraine aid\n\n6 hrs ago\n\nUS & Canada\n\n## Nato pledges more advanced air defences to Ukraine\n\n13 hrs ago\n\nEurope\n\n## Children among seven dead in Russia strike on Ukraine\n\n14 hrs ago\n\nEurope\n\nMore\n\n11 Apr 2024\n\n## Alexei Navalny's memoir to be published in October\n\nThe anti-corruption campaigner began work on his book while recovering from\nhis 2020 poisoning.\n\n11 Apr 2024\n\nEntertainment & Arts\n\n21 Mar 2024\n\n## Court denies Navalny mother's case against prison\n\nLyudmila Navalnaya had filed a claim of improper medical care against the\nRussian penal colony.\n\n21 Mar 2024\n\nEurope\n\n21 Mar 2024\n\n## Young people in West becoming unhappier, survey says\n\nResearchers at the World Happiness Report said the findings should ring alarm\nbells for policy-makers.\n\n21 Mar 2024\n\nWorld\n\n18 Mar 2024\n\n## Putin names Navalny and claims he agreed swap\n\nRussia's leader always refused to refer to the Kremlin critic by name, but now\nhe is dead, that has changed.\n\n18 Mar 2024\n\nEurope\n\n18 Mar 2024\n\n## Putin claims landslide and scorns US democracy\n\nOfficials give Vladimir Putin 87% of the vote, in an election where no\ncredible opponent could stand.\n\n18 Mar 2024\n\nEurope\n\n## Let us know you agree to cookies\n\nWe use cookies to give you the best online experience.\n\nPlease let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.\n\n  * No, take me to settings\n\n", "frontpage": true}
