I literally know people who don't even have home Internet because\nthey have unlimited mobile data (and generally some bucket of data for\ntethering). Right now, with an LTE only model cell phone on my first floor I\nsee 71.1 Mbps down and 9.15 Mbps up. Sometimes I see almost 100 Mbps down. On\nbad days it's still generally like 15 Mbps down. At good locations it's often\ncloser to 150 Mbps down. My daughter's new 5G cell phone is getting almost 300\nMbps down. I actually use my mobile connection to offload capacity from my\nhome Internet. Since Apple sells more iPhones than every other non iPhone\ndevice combined, I really don't think it matters a ton from the iPhone\nperspective. But even if the iPhone becomes your \"smart home remote control\"\nwhen at home, what routers don't work with the iPhone? This is such a bizarre\nmisunderstanding of the requirements for home networking, I can't even imagine\nhow this got published as an article.\n\nTwo, Apple's Airport models were rarely competitive for longer than a year or\ntwo and Apple was generally slow to update the hardware with revisions\nlanguishing for years. The fact that the thrust of the article is how people\nreally should upgrade because 6e is such a big deal, when the market is\nstarting to already move to WiFi 7 kind of shows the issues with being stuck\nin a single vendor world. 6e has been a thing for years now (going on 4 years\nif I have my math right), is Apple really only now incorporating the chips\ninto their devices? Either way, there's been 6e clients on the market for a\nwhile now with 6e routers available to support them. Even if Wifi 5, aka\n802.11ac, and WiFi 6, aka 802.11ax (non 6GHz variety) still has a strong\nfoothold of course. I readily acknowledge the reality of supporting devices\nfor years.\n\nThree, Apple's management software for their devices kind of sucked. If you\nhad a non Apple client device, I don't think you could manage the last model\nAC routers at all with those non Apple clients. No, not even with Windows with\nAirport Utility. Also, Airport models didn't offer a ton of features compared\nto their competitors. They were generally stripped down affairs says my memory\nas an owner of multiple Airport models, especially with the newer management\nsoftware (that literally removed features!). The client software was pretty\nmid, like pretty much all app only management solutions (let me tell you how\nmuch I loathe all these half baked tools, hate, hate, hate app only\nmanagement).\n\nFour. There are a lot of really good current WiFi 6e devices on the market,\nhow do these tech writers not understand how to configure one and connect a\nbackup drive to their existing routers and toggle drive sharing? There's a\nwhole thing in this article about how they need network backup and Apple could\nsolve this vacuum; yet, existing solutions allow backup targets and/or network\ndata sharing. My router has options for Samba, Time Machine, and even rsync.\nThese aren't your average users mind you, yet they don't understand how to\nmake this work right now? \"And just think of how much they could charge for\nthat embedded solid-state storage! They\u2019re leaving money on the table! Bleed\nus dry, Tim! Sell a line of them: AirPort Express mesh nodes, AirPort Extreme\nwith ports, AirPort Ultra with Time Capsule\" This thinking is so stupid, I\ndon't even understand how single source consumers can manager to make any\npurchasing decisions given the reasoning. You have good options for backup\nnow, use them. Don't let Apple bleed you dry!\n\nNathan\n\nApril 17, 2024 3:39 PM\n\n@Kristoffer Agreed. There are simply so many easy to use and robust models on\nthe market and made by companies who actually care about the product line.\n\nFor example: My current router is an AC model that is nearly 10 years old and\nit still rocks! For one reason, Asus actually added features to it over the\nyears via software update (hello mesh mode!), whereas my Airport gear\nliterally lost features after software updates. Secondly, it has decent\nsupport for 3rd party firmware, so there's always an outlet there to keep the\nrouters going if Asus were to drop support. Right now, at least 3 other\nfirmware providers support my model. Choice is excellent and it has kept many\nof my other network devices running for the same reason, whereas my Airport\ngear became a dead end once Apple lost interest. In fact, this router model\nactually started as a locked down T-Mobile branded model that was\nunsurprisingly abandoned when T-Mobile lost interest (sound familiar?).\nLuckily the community stepped in and kept the devices running with support.\n\nI have considered WiFi 6 and 6e upgrades to my home networking, but with\nthings more or less just continuing to work, I hate junking functional gear.\nYes, my Wifi connection can now bottleneck Internet speed to any one single\nclient given my home Internet is 500 Mbps down, and I can managed about 300\nMbps/400Mbps over Wifi generally with my AC clients. Since I do backups over\nnetwork, I really could use a speed boost and have considered it, then again,\nmy devices do incremental backups and generally there's not more than 20GB of\nbackup at any given time. It's tempting to upgrade, but I've never clamored\nfor Apple to get back into the game because why single source when there's\nalready excellent gear to choose from that will accomplish the same goals.\n\nTotal\n\nApril 17, 2024 5:22 PM\n\n@Nathan I'm sorry, I passed out several thousand words into your screed. Did\nyou say anything useful?\n\nOn a larger level, I love when the consensus yells about Apple and monopoly\nand how dare they but they should definitely build a new router / printer /\ndisplay. How dare they not do the things I WANT THEM TO.\n\nSam Rowlands\n\nApril 17, 2024 8:45 PM\n\nI love the performance and range of my single TP-Link router. But I'd rather\nhave my eye balls pecked at by crows than touch their admin interface.\n\nThe one reason that I bought so many Apple Base Stations, right from the\nmoment that Apple starting selling their own, was just how easy it was to\nadminister and maintain from a Mac.\n\nStupor\n\nApril 18, 2024 1:02 AM\n\n@Nathan Spill the beans then, son: what's the make/model of your all-singing,\nall-dancing router with Samba, Time Machine and rsync support? I'm in the\nmarket for one and could do with some recommendations.\n\nRamzez\n\nApril 18, 2024 2:03 AM\n\nFor WiFi backup to work first and for all Apple needs to fix their outdated\nTime Machine implementation. It\u2019s slow. It corrupts. It wastes so much space.\n\nWe had NAS from pretty much every vendor and now and then you get backup\ncorrupted. Connecting external drive will give the same results.\n\nAnd although on our current Unifi WiFi 6 we still can get easily 600/700 mbit\n- when Time Machine doing backup it barely uses 10.\n\nKristoffer\n\nApril 18, 2024 6:24 AM\n\n@Nathan WRT your point number four I think it's a combination \"what I see is\nall there is\" and learned helplessness.\n\n### Leave a Comment\n\n\u2190\n\nBlog Archives Tag Cloud Top Posts\n\nRecently Updated RSS Feed \u00b7 Comments Mastodon \u00b7 Twitter Apple News\n\nSupport this site via Patreon.\n\nTry my Mac apps:\n\nDropDMG EagleFiler SpamSieve ToothFairy\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2000\u20132024 Michael Tsai.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
