And it\u2019s starting to go global\nwith more features. You can use Meta AI on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and\nMessenger to get things done, learn, create and connect with the things that\nmatter to you. We first announced Meta AI at last year\u2019s Connect, and now,\nmore people around the world can interact with it in more ways than ever\nbefore.\n\nWe\u2019re rolling out Meta AI in English in more than a dozen countries outside of\nthe US. Now, people will have access to Meta AI in Australia, Canada, Ghana,\nJamaica, Malawi, New Zealand, Nigeria, Pakistan, Singapore, South Africa,\nUganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe \u2014 and we\u2019re just getting started.\n\nThanks to our latest advances with Meta Llama 3, Meta AI is smarter, faster\nand more fun than ever before.\n\n## Make Meta AI Work for You\n\nPlanning a night out with friends? Ask Meta AI to recommend a restaurant with\nsunset views and vegan options. Organizing a weekend getaway? Ask Meta AI to\nfind concerts for Saturday night. Cramming for a test? Ask Meta AI to explain\nhow hereditary traits work. Moving into your first apartment? Ask Meta AI to\n\u201cimagine\u201d the aesthetic you\u2019re going for and it will generate some inspiration\nphotos for your furniture shopping.\n\nWe want Meta AI to be available when you\u2019re trying to get things done at your\ncomputer too, so we\u2019re rolling out meta.ai (the website) today. Struggling\nwith a math problem? Need help making a work email sound more professional?\nMeta AI can help! And you can log in to save your conversations with Meta AI\nfor future reference.\n\n## Seamless Search Integration in the Apps You Know and Love\n\nMeta AI is also available in search across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and\nMessenger. You can access real-time information from across the web without\nhaving to bounce between apps. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re planning a ski trip in your\nMessenger group chat. Using search in Messenger you can ask Meta AI to find\nflights to Colorado from New York and figure out the least crowded weekends to\ngo \u2013 all without leaving the Messenger app.\n\n## Meta AI in Feed\n\nYou can also access Meta AI when you\u2019re scrolling through your Facebook Feed.\nCome across a post you\u2019re interested in?

We\u2019re starting to roll this out\ntoday in beta on WhatsApp and the Meta AI web experience in the US.\n\nYou\u2019ll see an image appear as you start typing \u2014 and it\u2019ll change with every\nfew letters typed, so you can watch as Meta AI brings your vision to life.\n\nThe images generated are also now sharper and higher quality, with a better\nability to include text in images. From album artwork, to wedding signage,\nbirthday decor and outfit inspo, Meta AI can generate images that bring your\nvision to life faster and better than ever before. It\u2019ll even provide helpful\nprompts with ideas to change the image, so you can keep iterating from that\ninitial starting point.\n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t stop there. Found an image you love? Ask Meta AI to animate it,\niterate on it in a new style or even turn it into a GIF to share with friends.\n\nWith our most powerful large language model under the hood, Meta AI is better\nthan ever. We\u2019re excited to share our next-generation assistant with even more\npeople and can\u2019t wait to see how it enhances people\u2019s lives. While these\nupdates are specific to Meta AI in Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger\nand on the web, Meta AI is also available in the US on Ray-Ban Meta smart\nglasses \u2014 and coming to Meta Quest.
