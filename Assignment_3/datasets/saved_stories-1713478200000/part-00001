Crucially,\nSafeguard owned a controlling portion of NDSI as part of this funding deal.\nCanova was the the company\u2019s first president while Davis was in charge of\nsales and marketing, and Warren Van Dyke Musser (Pete) of Safeguard was\nchairman. Their first building had previously been a truck dealership, and the\ncompany\u2019s mission was to make computers and printers. Their first products\nwere Zilog Z-80 machines with 64K RAM and printers capable of around one\nhundred sixty characters per second. The company quickly grew to around one\nhundred twenty employees and created a few products that never went on sale\nbut certainly cost money to design and prototype. From what I\u2019ve been able to\nfind, the only products from NDSI before 1983 were the Nexus microcomputer\nseries and the Image 800 printer series.\n\nNovell Data Systems Nexus 1 from Reddit user redruM69, z80, 5MB HDD, CP/M\n\nNDSI advertisement, BYTE, July 1981\n\nDrew Major was born on the 17th of June in 1956 in Los Angeles. He attended\nBYU and received his Bachelor of Science from the university in 1980. Along\nwith Dale Neibaur and Kyle Powell, he founded SuperSet Software in Provo\n(essentially, just drive south on State St from Orem, which is south from Salt\nLake City on I-15). SuperSet\u2019s primary goal was to further develop and then to\nmarket networking technology that the three former classmates had worked on\nwhile attending BYU and the Eyring Research Institute. All of these\ntechnologies and the gentlemen\u2019s research work had been for ARPANET projects,\nand most of these technologies were originally derivative works of Xerox\u2019s XNS\nprotocol but over time these became both the IPX (internetwork packet\nexchange) and SPX (sequenced packet exchange) protocols.\n\nIn 1981, Novell was on hard times. They simply didn\u2019t sell much equipment and\nthey\u2019d burned quite a bit of cash. As a general rule, investors like to make\nreturns and they dislike losses. The company needed something to set their\nmachines apart and drive sales. Someone thought it would be good to lean into\nnetworking. Accordingly, Novell hired SuperSet as consultants to help them\ndevelop that capability. This was an extremely good idea, as not long after,\nSafeguard sent Jack Messman to determine whether or not Novell was worth\nsaving and serve as the company\u2019s president for a time. He arrived to find\nMajor, Neibaur, and Powell playing a game they\u2019d written called Snipes.\nNormally, this wouldn\u2019t be a good thing, but in this case, it was a great\nthing. The three men were on different computers (TRS-80, Commodore PET, Apple\nII), but they were playing together over a network. Messman reported back:\n\u201cYou know, Pete, they've got something pretty interesting that they can do\nhere with this networking.\u201d According to Musser, it was that single visit that\nkept Novell alive, but Davis first and then later Canova were fired. Through\n1982 the company had no less than six different presidents, and the company\nwas mired in chaos. While there was quite a bit of turn over in leadership,\nthe company also laid off nearly all of its staff reducing head count to just\nfifteen.\n\nWhile Canova and Davis got zero credit for it, bringing network expertise into\nthe company allowed the company to demonstrate real network capabilities at\nthe November COMDEX of 1982 and to attract quite a bit of attention. One\nperson in particular who was attracted by this networking capability was Ray\nNoorda. Messman met him at COMDEX and from what I understand Jack Davis had\npreviously recommended him to Safeguard/Novell as a potential candidate to\nlead the company. According to Musser, Noorda wasn\u2019t one who was generally\nexcitable, he wasn\u2019t fond of many people, and he was a rather hard man. He was\nknown for being a no-nonsense kind of person who could turn a company around\nand save it.\n\nOn the 25th of January in 1983, Safeguard reincorporated NDSI as just Novell\nInc, and in April of that year Ray Noorda became the ninth president and the\nCEO of the newly renamed and brevity valuing company. Messman became chairman\nof the board and he represented Safeguard\u2019s interests. Noorda and his\nremaining fifteen employees promptly set about completely changing the focus\nof the company. Novell would now focus on software and not hardware, and\nNoorda made this non-optional as he completely disbanded the hardware division\nof the company. Importantly, the company also formally acquired SuperSet in\n1983, and subsequently, Drew Major became became the Chief Scientist at\nNovell.\n\nNovell logo from 1983 - 1996\n\nNoorda brought $125000 (roughly $389465 in 2024) of his own money into the\ncompany, and he borrowed another $1.3 million (around $4 million in 2024). For\nthis, he gained a personal stake in the company of thirty three percent. He\nhad tied his fortunes to Novell, and he was determined to win. The visionary\nidea he had was to take Major\u2019s earlier disk and printer sharing network\ntechnologies and make it possible to do file sharing instead. Why lock a whole\ndisk if you a person only requires a single file? This was Novell NetWare 1.0\nthat allowed users of the first true network operating system to access files\non a server as if they were local. NetWare had a true dedicated server\narchitecture, a specific and dedicated machine was the server and managed\nresources and services for clients. In a true stroke of genius, Novell thought\nabout security from day one. Networks were still somewhat new in 1983, and\nmost people hadn\u2019t even begun to consider the security implications of the\ntechnology, but NetWare had both user authentication and access controls.\nFinally, while NetWare was initially IPX/SPX only, it was designed in such a\nway that it would be adaptable. Whatever the network topology was, NetWare\nwould be there.\n\nThe timing of NetWare was truly remarkable. In 1983, hard disks were really\njust starting to penetrate the market with the PC XT having been released on\nthe 8th of March of that year. NetWare was there for the office that was\nwealthy enough to own both a hard disk or two and some networking equipment.\nThe first version supported both PC-DOS and CP/M clients. The server hardware,\nhowever, was initially required to be a Motorola 68000 (NetWare 68) but this\nchanged very quickly following the release of the XT. NetWare was ported to\nthe Intel 8088/8086 (NetWare 86), and it began to gain support for a very wide\nvariety of expansion cards. These were followed by Advanced NetWare 1.0 in\n1985 which allowed for more than one server on any given network. Later that\nyear (or early in 1986), Advanced NetWare 1.2 was released with limited\nsupport for the 286 and its various features and improvements.\n\nNetWare 2.0 for the Motorola 68000 was released in December of 1985, for the\n8088/8086 in January of 1986, and for the 80286 in December of 1986. NetWare\n2.0 for the 286 allowed for protected mode operation, use of 16MB of RAM,\nbetter multitasking, larger volume size limits, and RAM disk caches for\nfrequently accessed files. All of this taken together increased performance\nsignificantly which made larger networks more feasible. NetWare 2 supported\nmore hardware from its first day on the market, and it supported all major\nnetwork configurations of the day (ARCNET, Token Ring, Ethernet). What\u2019s more,\nNetWare 2 also supported Loadable Modules (NLMs). This feature allowed both\nNovell and third parties to release add-on software with new capabilities such\nas database servers, backup solutions, anti-virus programs, mail, groupware\nsuites, and much more. Third parties had been making add-on products for\nNetWare as early as April of 1983, but NetWare Loadable Modules brought\nstandards and an official status to the various services that add-ons enabled.\n\nNetWare 2 for 286 improved on other versions in another way that allowed\nNovell to position its network solution as an alternative to minicomputers and\nmainframes: fault tolerance. This included things like read-after-write\nverification, bad-block remapping done during the course of normal operation,\nsoftware RAID, transaction tracking (so an incomplete write could be\nreversed), and support for up to four network cards in concurrent use. A\nstandard license for NetWare was for one hundred clients. From what I can\nfind, most Novell customers at this time bought pre-assembled and purpose\nbuilt servers when going for that standard license. The cost was then\ndetermined based upon the hardware and client count with typical pricing\nranging from $4500 to $12000. If one were to purchase NetWare only, the\npricing was around $2000 (roughly $5600 in 2024) depending upon precisely\nwhich version, client count, and feature set was desired. This price could go\nup to $4995 (around $14000 in 2024) if a company wished for every feature. For\nthe price conscious, any random 286-based machine could run the server with an\nintroductory price for four concurrent users of $595 (this was referred to as\nELS NetWare [ELS stands for Entry Level Solution], cost around $1700 in 2024).\nThis entry level system could later be upgraded to ELS II with support for\neight concurrent users at a discounted price, though I haven\u2019t found what that\nprice was as most ads advise purchasers to call the software vendor. With the\nfull NetWare 2 286 release, a dedicated server could serve bootable disk\nimages for clients as long as those clients\u2019 boot ROMs or BIOS had NetWare\nnetwork boot capabilities, but the ELS versions of NetWare lacked this\nability.\n\nIn 1987, Novell re-entered the hardware market albeit in a rather modest way.\nThe company felt that a primary issue in driving NetWare adoption was the\ndearth of affordable network hardware. Their answer, released in February, was\nthe NE1000. This was an 8 bit card based off of the National Semiconductor\n8390. The first versions were branded as the E-Net adapter and priced at just\n$395 (around $1000 in 2024) while many competitors\u2019 products were closer to\n$600. A 16 bit card, the NE2000, was released in 1988 at a price of $495\n(about $1300 in 2024). Both cards were designed using off-the-shelf components\nand manufactured by Eagle (an arm of Anthem Technologies). Novell\u2019s\ndistributors would actually order and purchase these cards directly from Eagle\nand not from Novell. Novell simply received a royalty for their design work.\nThe company also permitted other companies to clone their designs. For Novell,\nmore network cards meant a larger potential market for network software, and\nthat was a market in which their influence was very swiftly rising. The NE1000\nand NE2000 were wildly successful selling at nearly twenty thousand per month.\nThe cards\u2019 status as a top seller was further cemented in 1989 when the prices\nwere lowered to $295 (about $738 in 2024) for the NE1000 and $345 (around $863\nin 2024) for the NE2000.\n\nHaving fifty percent of the network operating system market and sizable chunk\nof the network interface card market wasn\u2019t enough. There were still all of\nthese minicomputers and mainframes out there without Novell\u2019s involvement and\nI suppose that this fact annoyed Noorda? So, making headlines on the 1st of\nFebruary in 1987, Novell purchased CXI. CXI specialized in making equipment\nand software that allowed the integration of IBM PCs and compatibles into\nnetworks of IBM mainframes and terminals. This acquisition involved a stock\nswap valued at around $34 million (around $93 million in 2024) and made CXI a\nwholly owned subsidiary of Novell. In October of that same year, CXI\nintroduced an IBM PS/2 add-in board that would connect PS/2s to both IBM\nmainframes and NetWare LANs. The board cost $545 (around $1489 in 2024) and\ncame with software to enable all of the various functionality required.\n\nSoftCraft was started by Doug and Nancy Woodward in 1982 in Austin with Nancy\nas the company president, and Doug as the VP and lead software developer.\nTheir primary product was called Btrieve, a transactional database program. It\nwas pretty neat. The early versions for PC-DOS ran as a TSR providing an API\nto the database engine. Later versions featured network access capabilities\nand multi-user functionality and record locking. This wasn\u2019t a cheap product\npriced at nearly $1000 (about $3000 in 2024) but applications built using\nBtrieve\u2019s TSR could be distributed without a royalty. By 1985, SoftCraft\u2019s\nproducts were seeing significant use in the finance sector, and more than five\nthousand developers were building products on their APIs. Novell acquired the\ncompany in 1987. Nancy Woodward became the VP and GM of Novell\u2019s presence in\nAustin while Doug became the VP of Advanced Database Technologies. The first\nfruit of this was released that same year with Btrieve being present on\nNetWare 2.15 as a value added process. Expanding their products with\nmainframes and databases was successful, and Novell closed 1988 with sales\npassing $347 million (roughly $910 million in 2024) and a market share over\nfifty percent.\n\nNovell released NetWare 3.0 for the 80386 in 1989. This version was a 32 bit\nnetwork operating system operating in protected mode, with dynamically\nloadable/unloadable drivers, a C language API and a library set for NetWare\nloadable modules, with better support for both Macintosh and UNIX clients,\nsupporting far larger disks, much more memory, and it cached the entire file\nallocation table in memory greatly which increased performance. NetWare 3.0\ndid not, however, have preemptive multitasking, and all NLMs ran in ring 0. As\na result of these two shortcomings, NetWare 3.0 did little to improve upon\nNetWare\u2019s reliability which wasn\u2019t bad by the standards of the day, but not\nexactly amazing either. Performance was simply deemed more important at the\ntime. Yet, while the system itself may not have been more reliable, version\n3\u2019s network communications certainly were. Version 3 saw the introduction of\nthe NetWare Core Protocol which was an overhaul of the IPX/SPX implementation\nthat brought uniformity to the way file, print, and other services were\nhandled. With NCP, Novell brought better authentication as well as stronger\nencryption to the product. This version also saw Novell introduce the NetWare\nLink Services Protocol which was an improved routing protocol that allowed for\nmore efficient scaling and thus much larger networks. NetWare 3.0 was still\nconfigured and administered using text-based utilities and lacked a graphical\nuser interface.\n\nNetWare 3.12 Console Monitor, image from MegaTech YouTube channel\n\nBy 1990, if anyone on Earth had a network server in a medium to small office\nsetting, it was almost certainly a Novell server as the company\u2019s products\nclaimed an easy monopoly with somewhere from sixty five to possibly ninety\npercent of the market and sales of $497.5 million (almost $1.2 billion in\n2024). The company had a strong presence in Europe, South America, and Asia,\nand made a strong push into Japan in 1990/1991. By the end of 1991, half of\nNovell\u2019s annual revenue was from locations outside of the USA. Corvus had\nfiled for bankruptcy a few years earlier, and Banyan VINES and Artisoft\nLANtastic were battling for that remaining minority percentage of the market.\nThe company began changing around this same time. Microsoft\u2019s NT was getting a\nlot of buzz in the tech press, and Novell wanted to be in a position to\ncompete with Microsoft directly.\n\nOn the 12th of December in 1991, Novell announced a joint venture with AT&T\nnamed Univel, headquartered in San Jose, that aimed to develop the Destiny\ndesktop UNIX operating system. Novell held the controlling share in the\nventure with fifty five percent, and the bulk of the engineering efforts took\nplace in Sandy, Utah. The basis for this system was UNIX SVR4.2 with the\nMoOLIT toolkit providing the looks of either OPEN LOOK or MOTIF depending upon\nthe user\u2019s preferences. This system made use of virtual filesystems as a\ndescendent of SVR4, and it allowed support for VxFS or UFS as root, featured\nboth TCP/IP and IPX networking, and it had DOS compatibility via DOS Merge 3\n(essentially VDMs) and DR-DOS 6. This system became known as UnixWare upon its\nrelease in 1992. From articles of the time period, Novell made the assumption\nthat UnixWare\u2019s desktop release would only ever require NetWare, and their\nPortable NetWare packages for UNIX became NetWare for UNIX although overhauled\nfor this first party effort. The Advanced Server edition of UnixWare is the\nrelease that featured IPX, SPX, and TCP/IP. The other notable difference\nbetween the two was that the desktop release only supported two concurrent\nusers while the Advanced Server had no limit. Despite lowering its prices in\nApril of 1993, Univel couldn\u2019t move units. On the 21st of December in 1992,\nNovell announced its intentions to acquire USL including all of the UNIX\ncopyrights, trademarks, and licensing contracts. This was completed by June of\n1993. USL was folded into the Novell UNIX Systems Group and moved to Utah.\nShortly after the acquisition, Joel Appelbaum, former Univel President & CEO,\nand Roel Pieper, former CEO of USL, resigned. UnixWare 1.1 was released in\nDecember of 1993.\n\nTo compete with Microsoft Windows 3, Novell intended to add rich networking\ncapabilities to a multitasking version of DR-DOS and then use GEM as a\ngraphical environment. Don\u2019t think of this as DOS though. After booting into\nthe 16 bit DR-DOS environment with which many of us are familiar, the system\nloaded Vladivar, a 32 bit preemptively multitasking, multithreaded, operating\nsystem kernel featuring hardware virtualization, scheduling, dynamically\nloadable device drivers, and namespaces. This software was previously used for\nisolated virtual DOS machines, but was modified and repurposed to be a more\ngeneral OS kernel. However, the possibility of legal action from Apple over\nGEM\u2019s look and feel presented a problem. Accordingly, Novell\u2019s head of\nmarketing, Darrell Miller, reached out to Apple\u2019s CEO, John Sculley, about\nporting System 7 to the 486. Sculley agreed, and on the 14th of February in\n1992, project Star Trek began with a scheduled prototype completion date set\nfor the 31st of October. Yeah... about that... classic MacOS was largely\nwritten in Motorola 68k assembly language. The newer Pascal bits were\ncertainly easier to port, but the 68k and the 486 are very different CPUs.\nAdditionally, the Macintosh was heavily reliant on ROMs. This porting effort\nwould be a rather Herculean task. Ultimately, the ROMs were implemented as\nsoftware that would run on Valdivar, many of the assembly language bits were\nrewritten in a higher level language, and a functional prototype was indeed\ndelivered but a bit late, the 1st of December. They did overshoot the goal\nthough. The prototype had working QuickDraw GX and QuickTime. Despite\ndelivering the working product, the project was cancelled at Apple when\nMichael Spindler took over as CEO. Novell then released the updated DOS\nenvironment without Apple\u2019s bits and bytes as Novell DOS 7 with TASKMGR\nproviding the multitasking controls and also providing an API for GUIs to\nleverage within EMM386. Unrelated to our main topic, some of Apple\u2019s code\nrewriting helped in the transition to PowerPC and the file-based ROMs were\nlater used in the iMac.\n\nTo compete with Microsoft\u2019s graphical programming tools, Novell purchased\nSerius in June of 1993. Serius was a company Novell had worked with in the\npast, and this acquisition provided them with a graphical programming\nlanguage, Serius89, that they renamed AppWare, and products built with AppWare\nbecame AppWare Loadable Modules for NetWare.\n\nNovell completed the purchase of both WordPerfect Corporation as well as the\nrights, trademarks, and assets of Quattro Pro (from Borland) on the 24th of\nJune in 1994. These products were combined WordPerfect Corp\u2019s Presentations\nand GroupWise and the combined product became Novell PerfectOffice 3 in\nDecember of 1994.\n\nThrough all of this, various NetWare releases were made. NetWare\u2019s primary\nrelease had made it to version 4.0 by April. This version brought NetWare\nDirectory Services to the market in direct competition with Microsoft Active\nDirectory. NetWare 4 also introduced filesystem level compression,\npublic/private key encryption, and NetWare Asynchronous Services Interface\nwhich allowed the server to share multiple serial devices like modems with\nclients via port redirection. By this point, clients had been made at some\npoint in time for machines on all available x86 chips, 68k Macintosh, VMS,\nUNIX, DOS, Windows, and OS/2 and servers were available for UNIX, OS/2, VMS,\nand of course NetWare as the server OS. Various versions existed for different\nprice points, but the ELS system ended with 2.12, and Novell introduced\nNetWare Lite in 1991 as its successor. Following the release of version 4,\nhowever, the version craziness came to an end so that things like \u201cELS NetWare\nLevel I v2.12\u201d from March of 1990 would no longer be something that a sales\nperson at Novell would need to elucidate to the bewildered customer who hadn\u2019t\nexpected to need a glossary when he/she really just needed file and printer\nsharing. Version 4 also brought graphical tooling to NetWare for the first\ntime (for some functions on some platforms).\n\nNetWare server for OS/2, showing the console monitor, image from zx.net.nz\n\nNetWare 4 was easier to install, operate, and maintain while also being more\nrobust with preemptive multitasking, symmetric multiprocessing, directory\nservices, TCP/IP on all SKUs, web services, and GroupWise (email, calendaring,\nPIM, instant messaging, document management).\n\nOn the 6th of April in 1994, Ray Noorda resigned as CEO of Novell. He had\nsaved the company from the dustbin of history and brought it to amazing\nheights as the third largest software company on Earth at the time. He\nremained chairman of the company and placed Robert J. Frankenberg as CEO.\nFrankenberg had been at HP for twenty five years where his last position saw\nhim leading the personal computer business there. This change in leadership\ncame at a rough time for Novell. The company had spent around $1.5 billion\n(over $3 billion in 2024) getting its hands on WordPerfect and Quattro Pro,\nand Novell\u2019s stock price took a hit as did the company\u2019s profits with Novell\ntaking a substantial loss for the year.\n\nBy 1995, it became quite obvious that many of the acquisitions Novell had made\nweren\u2019t great moves. Frankenberg promptly reversed course. Btrieve had already\nbeen sold back to its owners, UnixWare and related technologies were sold to\nSCO, AppWare was sold to Network Multimedia Inc, the PerfectOffice products\n(except for GroupWise) were sold to Corel, and with the company\u2019s focus back\nto its core product things went decently well. Revenues for 1995 were strong\nwith $2.041 billion (about $4.1 billion in 2024) in revenue and $338 million\n(about $688 million in 2024) in profits.\n\nWhile NetWare continued to ship, the company made tons of money and things\ngenerally seemed to be going well, the board pressured Frankenberg to quit.\nPrimarily, revenues were strong over Frankenberg\u2019s two and half years but\nprofits weren\u2019t particularly great (about a fifty percent drop in profits in\nthe company's third quarter), and the board was increasingly worried that\nNovell was \u201cmissing out on the Internet.\u201d The company announced Frankenberg\u2019s\nresignation on the 29th of August in 1996. John Young of HP took over as\ninterim chairman, and Joseph Marengi became interim company president while he\nsearched for a suitable replacement for Frankenberg. Eric Emerson Schmidt,\nauthor of lex, took over the company on the 7th of April in 1997 as Chairman\nand CEO. Prior to this, he\u2019d been at Bell Labs, PARC, and Sun. The company he\ntook over was decidedly moribund. From 1995 forward, all of NetWare\u2019s major\noperating system competitors shipped with networking support out of the box.\nIn particular, Noorda\u2019s fears had materialized more strongly than anyone may\nhave thought; Windows NT was good. It provided file and print services on a\nnetwork, and it could also run applications. Unlike NetWare, NT was\nexceedingly easy to use and the entire system could be administered\ngraphically. NT was also truly and fully preemptively multitasking, and\nperhaps most importantly for small businesses... NT was cheaper. NT was better\nthan NetWare in many ways, and NT was cheaper than NetWare. While NetWare had\nemphasized speed and security above all else, it was a worse product in every\nother way for many users. In a very short time (start of 1997), NT had taken\nforty three percent of the network operating system market, and Novell\u2019s\nNetWare had fallen to just thirty three percent.\n\nEric Schmidt\n\nAlmost immediately, Schmidt laid off somewhere between fifteen and twenty\npercent of Novell\u2019s workforce, reduced shipments of NetWare as existing retail\nstocks were high, and dedicated the company to upgrading NetWare. Oddly, the\ncompany still chose to build a new headquarters of four hundred twelve\nthousand square feet for its twelve hundred employees. The company didn\u2019t end\nup moving into their new offices for a few years, but the construction and\ncosts started in the era of Schmidt\u2019s joining the company.\n\nNovell headquarters in Provo, image from Bloomberg\n\nOn the 4th of March in 1997, Novell announced that it had filed two separate\nlawsuits against LG and Super Resources alleging copyright and trademark\ninfringement. Novell claimed that the two companies had used upgraded serial\nnumbers for NetWare and had then sold them as new products to unwitting end-\nusers. Novell claimed that these end-users were not entitled to the upgrade\nproduct as they hadn\u2019t been previous license holders. This was not the first\nlawsuit of this kind. The company had filed a similar suit against Aqua\nSystems in 1994, which had been settled in August of 1995.\n\nNovell\u2019s logo from 1996 forward, image from Novell\n\nLater in March of 1997, Netscape and Novell started a joint venture named\nNovonyx. The idea with Novonyx was to create an enterprise webserver for both\nintranet and internet use-cases that would work on Novell NetWare. Novell\nclosed 1997 with $1 billion (nearly $2 billion in 2024) in revenue and a $78\nmillion (about $151 million in 2024) loss.\n\nNovell\u2019s alternate logo from 1996 forward\n\nOn the 27th of January in 1998, Novonyx was shut down. NetWare 5 was released\nin October of 1998 and shipped with Netscape\u2019s FastTrack webserver instead.\nThis version of NetWare shifted the default network protocol to TCP/IP, had\nfull GUI support, introduced Novell Storage Services as the default\nfilesystem, added a JVM, introduced Novel Distribution Print Services, added\npubkey support to directory services along with DNS and DHCP, added support\nfor SANs, and added clustering support. This release was a success with just\nover a million copies installed, a higher figure than NetWare\u2019s competition,\nand returned the company to profitability with nearly $1 billion in revenue\nand $102 million (about $194 million in 2024) in income.\n\nNetWare Administrator showing the ACME business tree, image from Novell\n\nOn the 27th of August in 1998, Novell announced a lawsuit against PMI\nIndustries of San Diego for trademark and copyright infringement for selling\nupgrades as though they were full products to customers who\u2019d not previously\nheld a NetWare license along with unbundled OEM products.\n\nWith Novell\u2019s litigious fervor and the growing preference in the market for\nWindows NT, many resellers dropped NetWare altogether, recertified their\nNovell Certified Engineers as Microsoft Certified Professionals, and severed\nall ties with Novell. Sadly for Novell, 1999 proved to be the year that\nWindows NT truly won the fight with two million copies sold, roughly double\nNetWare. Yet, Novell was still profitable with nearly $1.3 billion in revenue\nand $191 million (around $355 million in 2024) in income.\n\nIn 2001 after multiple rounds of layoffs, Novell needed reinvent itself. While\nNovell had always offered some services in addition to its software, the\nsoftware was always the clear focus. Shifting to services simply wasn\u2019t\nsomething in which the company had any deep expertise, and they were losing\nmoney fast, so there wasn\u2019t really time enough to build that expertise\ninternally. The solution was found in Cambridge Technology Partners at which\nJack Messman was CEO. He also happened to have a board seat at Novell. The\nacquisition was announced on the 13th of March in 2001 and it was completed on\nthe 9th of July in 2001. Jack Messman became CEO of the company, while Eric\nSchmidt remained chairman and chief strategist. On the 11th of July, Messman\ngave his first address to the unified company stating an intent to \u201cleverage\nsynergies and execute on an innovative go-to-market strategy in order to best\ndeliver on existing market opportunity.\u201d Schmidt had joined the board of\nGoogle as chairman in March of 2001, became CEO of Google in August, and he\nsubsequently left Novell behind. After the CTP acquisition, Novell relocated\nto Cambridge, Massachusetts but the company chose to keep technical\ndevelopment work in Provo, Utah. In October of 2001, Novell released NetWare\n6. This release greatly simplified the licensing scheme for NetWare, and it\nadded the ability for remote users to access intranet services. Novell lost\n$273 million in 2001 (around $478 million in 2024).\n\nAs other companies before it, Novell was faced with two unbeatable foes. There\nwas Microsoft on one side and Linux on the other. In response the company did\nwhat it had done so well in the past, it made two more acquisitions. In August\nof 2003, Novell purchased Ximian who made Evolution (an enterprise style email\nclient) and Mono (an opensource .Net implementation). In November of 2003,\nNovell purchased SuSE.\n\nIn August of 2003, the last major release of NetWare was made: version 6.5.\nThis release brought quite a bit of open source software into NetWare with a\nGNU userland, MySQL database, and PHP while also extending quite a bit of\nfunctionality to the web. This final version gave NetWare customers USB\nstorage support, a Java application server, and encrypted volume support. As a\nsign of Novell\u2019s changing fortunes, however, administrators could synchronize\ntheir NetWare directory with either a Windows NT domain or with Active\nDirectory. I imagine that this was the route through which most customers left\nNetWare altogether.\n\nOn the 20th of January in 2004, SCO filed a slander of title lawsuit against\nNovell in the Utah state court system. SCO\u2019s hope was to have Novell remove\nall claims to UNIX. That case ended in Novell\u2019s favor on the 9th of June in\n2004, and Novell filed a counter suit against SCO on the 29th of July in 2005\nwith multiple claims. This ended on the 10th of August in 2007 with Novell\nbeing named the owner of both UNIX and UnixWare copyrights and with SCO being\nrequired to pay Novell its portion of profit from the Sun and Microsoft UNIX\nlicenses. Before any payments could be made, SCO filed for bankruptcy. This\nmove didn\u2019t work out for the Santa Cruz Operation, and they were denied a\nstay. Appeals and motions were made, but on the 30th of August in 2011, an\nappeals court affirmed everything in Novell\u2019s favor.\n\nFrom the time of the SuSE acquisition forward, Novell operated as an\nenterprise Linux services company, and provided support for legacy NetWare\ncustomers. The company laid off quite a bit of staff in 2005, and Messman was\nfired in 2006 along with Joseph Tibbetts, the CFO.\n\nOn the 30th of April in 2011, Attachmate completed their acquisition of\nNovell. On Monday, the 2nd of May, eight hundred employees were laid off.\nAttachmate was then purchased by Micro Focus on the 20th of November in 2014\nwith SuSE being sold to EQT Partners in 2019. Micro Focus was acquired by\nOpentext in 2023.\n\nI now have readers from many of the companies whose history I cover, and many\nof you were present for time periods I cover.
