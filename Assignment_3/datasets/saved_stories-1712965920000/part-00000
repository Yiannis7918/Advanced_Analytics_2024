(NOIRLab/NSF/AURA/J. da Silva )\n\nOne day, the Sun will die.\n\nOur beautiful star can't last forever. Eventually the elements that fuel its\nfusion will run out, and Sol will undergo the wild transformation into a white\ndwarf \u2013 puffing up into a red giant whose radius might reach as far as Mars\nbefore ejecting its outer material as its core collapses into a stellar\nremnant that shines only with the heat left over from its death.\n\nWe have a pretty good idea of how this will go for the Sun itself, kicking off\nin about 5 billion years. But the planets \u2013 what about them? What about Earth?\nWhat about us?\n\nLed by physicist Amornrat Aungwerojwit of Naresuan University in Thailand, a\nteam of scientists has analyzed long-term changes in brightness for three\nwhite dwarfs, and extrapolated what that means for the planetary systems\naround them.\n\nFortunately we can rest assured that humanity (and whatever we evolve into)\nwill be long gone by then, extinct if not living it up elsewhere in the\ncosmos. But this beautiful blue marble we call home, and other planets, will\nnot escape unscathed. According to the analysis of white dwarf stars, the\ndeath throes of the Sun are going to unleash Solar System carnage.\n\nIn short, Mercury and Venus are goners, as is anything else in the innermost\ncircle of the Solar System. They're going to end up torn apart and devoured by\nthe Sun, slurped down like planet spaghetti.\n\nEarth may or may not survive, depending on how its orbit changes with respect\nto the Sun's shrinking mass and shifting interactions between the planets. If\nit does narrowly escape, it will look very different from the lush, habitable\nworld it is today.\n\n\"Whether or not the Earth can just move out fast enough before the Sun can\ncatch up and burn it is not clear,\" says physicist Boris G\u00e4nsicke of the\nUniversity of Warwick in the UK, \"but [if it does] the Earth would [still]\nlose its atmosphere and ocean and not be a very nice place to live.\"\n\nHow can we tell all this from looking at white dwarf stars? By studying\nchanges in their brightness.\n\nFluctuations in starlight can mean a few things, but if they're regular, the\nrise and fall in intensity can suggest something is orbiting the star,\nperiodically blocking some of its light.\n\nThe three stars analyzed by the researchers in this latest study have changes\nin brightness that previous research suggests is produced by orbiting clouds\nof planetary debris.\n\n\"Previous research had shown that when asteroids, moons, and planets get close\nto white dwarfs,\" Aungwerojwit says, \"the huge gravity of these stars rips\nthese small planetary bodies into smaller and smaller pieces.\"\n\nAn artist's impression of clouds of debris orbiting a white dwarf, and causing\nit to dim. (Dr Mark Garlick/The University of Warwick)\n\nBy studying 17 years' worth of data on their three very different white dwarf\nstars, the researchers were able to put together a picture of how this process\ncan evolve. All three stars showed signs of transits \u2013 dips in starlight \u2013\nconsistent with giant, irregular clouds of debris getting pulverized into\nsmaller and smaller dust before disappearing, probably because the clumps of\ndust and rock were being slurped into the white dwarf.\n\nOne star showed signs of some sort of catastrophic event in 2010, another in\n2015. The third star had irregular dimming events every few months, and\nchaotic fluctuations on the scale of minutes. All three stars are now behaving\nperfectly normally, with the transit events no longer occurring.\n\nThis suggests that planetary dismemberment and devouring happens pretty\nquickly. But if Earth is fated for destruction, it's unlikely to be quite so\nviolent.\n\n\"The sad news is that the Earth will probably just be swallowed up by an\nexpanding Sun, before it becomes a white dwarf,\" G\u00e4nsicke says.\n\n\"For the rest of the Solar System, some of the asteroids located between Mars\nand Jupiter, and maybe some of the moons of Jupiter may get dislodged and\ntravel close enough to the eventual white dwarf to undergo the shredding\nprocess we have investigated.\"\n\nNot to worry, though. Earth's oceans are going to boil away in about a billion\nyears, long before the Sun gets to that point.\n\nThe research has been published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal\nAstronomical Society.\n\nTrending News\n\nFasting-Style Diet Seems to Result in Dynamic Changes to Human Brain Health4\ndays ago\n\nThe Polar Vortex Has Shifted Into Reverse \u2013 And Is Now Spinning Backwards\nEnvironment7 days ago\n\nBrain Acidity Linked With Multiple Neurological Disorders Health2 days ago\n\n", "frontpage": false}
