Christie's Images LTD. 2024\n\nSome 1,700 years ago, a scribe living at a monastery in Egypt wrote out two\ncomplete books of the Bible over a 40-year period. Today, the rare liturgical\ntext is known as the Crosby-Sch\u00f8yen Codex, one of the world\u2019s oldest books.\n\nThe 104 pages of papyrus illustrate the early spread of Christianity\u2014and this\nsummer, they are expected to sell for between $2.6 million and $3.8 million.\n\nThe codex features Coptic script, an Egyptian language written in the Greek\nalphabet primarily used by Christians. It has survived the centuries in\nfragments: Pages are preserved in individual panes of plexiglass, all of which\nfit in two lockable wooden boxes, reports CNN\u2019s Lianne Kolirin.\n\nAccording to Christie\u2019s, which will auction the work in June, the codex is the\nearliest known surviving Christian liturgical book. Created in Upper Egypt\nbetween the third and fourth centuries C.E., it features the New Testament\u2019s\nfirst epistle of Peter and the Old Testament\u2019s Book of Jonah.\n\n\u201cThe Crosby-Sch\u00f8yen is one of the earliest witnesses to a development in\ncultural and textual transmission,\u201d Eugenio Donadoni, senior specialist for\nbooks and manuscripts at Christie\u2019s in London, tells CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely\nanything like this will ever come to auction again.\u201d\n\nOne of the oldest books in existence up for auction * FRANCE 24 English\n\nWatch on\n\nDiscovered in the 1950s, the text is part of a collection known as the Bodmer\nPapyri\u2014a trove of ancient Christian writings, biblical manuscripts and pagan\nworks found in Egypt and purchased by Swiss collector Martin Bodmer. The codex\nmade its way to the University of Mississippi, where it resided until 1981,\nbefore it was acquired by the Norwegian manuscript collector Martin Sch\u00f8yen in\n1988.\n\nThe upcoming sale will feature a number of texts from Sch\u00f8yen\u2019s collection,\nwhich is \u201cone of the largest private manuscript collections in the world,\u201d per\nReuters\u2019 Christine Kiernan. The Crosby-Sch\u00f8yen Codex is billed as the oldest\nknown book that\u2019s privately owned.\n\nThe historic text is a valuable \u201cwitness to the earliest spread of\nChristianity around the Mediterranean,\u201d Donadoni tells CNN. \u201cThe earliest\nmonks in Upper Egypt in the earliest Christian monastery were using this very\nbook to celebrate the earliest Easter celebrations, only a few hundred years\nafter Christ and only a hundred or so years after the last Gospel was\nwritten.\u201d\n\nThe text also sheds light on a pivotal moment in the history of bookmaking.\nFor millennia, ancient Egyptians wrote and read literature on rolled papyrus\nscrolls. But in the first few centuries C.E., the codex design\u2014stacks of pages\nbound together\u2014became increasingly popular, ultimately replacing scrolls as\nthe dominant medium. Donadoni tells Reuters that the Crosby-Sch\u00f8yen Codex was\nmade during that transitional period.\n\nResearchers think the book survived due to Egypt\u2019s arid climate. Few other\ntexts from the third and fourth centuries exist today, as Donadoni tells\nReuters, adding: \u201cAll the major finds of Christian manuscripts that we had in\nthe 20th century and at the end of the 19th century are all concentrated in\nEgypt for those very precise climactic conditions.\u201d\n\nAfter going on view in Paris in late April, the Crosby-Sch\u00f8yen Codex will\ntravel to London, where it will be sold on June 11.\n\nGet the latest stories in your inbox every weekday.\n\nSonja Anderson | READ MORE\n\nSonja Anderson is a writer and reporter based in New York City.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  1.
