Virtually all of these exploit the natural\nproperties of the underlying materials.\n\nBut an emerging class of materials is more versatile, even programmable.\n\nKnown as metamaterials, these substances are meticulously engineered such that\ntheir structural makeup\u2014as opposed to their composition\u2014determines their\nproperties. Some metamaterials might make long-distance wireless power\ntransfer practical, others could bring \u201cinvisibility cloaks\u201d or futuristic\nmaterials that respond to brainwaves.\n\nBut most examples are solid metamaterials\u2014a Harvard team wondered if they\ncould make a metafluid. As it turns out, yes, absolutely. The team recently\ndescribed their results in Nature.\n\n\u201cUnlike solid metamaterials, metafluids have the unique ability to flow and\nadapt to the shape of their container,\u201d Katia Bertoldi, a professor in applied\nmechanics at Harvard and senior author of the paper, said in a press release.\n\u201cOur goal was to create a metafluid that not only possesses these remarkable\nattributes but also provides a platform for programmable viscosity,\ncompressibility, and optical properties.\u201d\n\nThe team\u2019s metafluid is made up of hundreds of thousands of tiny, stretchy\nspheres\u2014each between 50 to 500 microns across\u2014suspended in oil. The spheres\nchange shape depending on the pressure of the surrounding oil. At higher\npressures, they deform, one hemisphere collapsing inward into a kind of half\nmoon shape. They then resume their original spherical shape when the pressure\nis relieved.\n\nThe metafluid\u2019s properties\u2014such as viscosity or opacity\u2014change depending on\nwhich of these shapes its constituent spheres assume. The fluid\u2019s properties\ncan be fine-tuned based on how many spheres are in the liquid and how big or\nthick they are.\n\nGreater pressure causes the spheres to collapse. When the pressure is\nrelieved, they resume their spherical shape. Credit: Adel Djellouli/Harvard\nSEAS\n\nAs a proof of concept, the team filled a hydraulic robotic gripper with their\nmetafluid. Robots usually have to be programmed to sense objects and adjust\ngrip strength. The team showed the gripper could automatically adapt to a\nblueberry, a glass, and an egg without additional sensing or programming\nrequired. The pressure of each object \u201cprogrammed\u201d the liquid to adjust,\nallowing the gripper to pick up all three, undamaged, with ease.\n\nThe team also showed the metafluid could switch from opaque, when its\nconstituents were spherical, to more transparent, when they collapsed. The\nlatter shape, the researchers said, functions like a lens focusing light,\nwhile the former scatters light.\n\nThe metafluid obscures the Harvard logo then becomes more transparent as the\ncapsules collapse. Credit: Adel Djellouli/Harvard SEAS\n\nAlso of note, the metafluid behaves like a Newtonian fluid when its components\nare spherical, meaning its viscosity only changes with shifts in temperature.\nWhen they collapse, however, it becomes a non-Newtonian fluid, where its\nviscosity changes depending on the shear forces present. The greater the shear\nforce\u2014that is, parallel forces pushing in opposite directions\u2014the more liquid\nthe metafluid becomes.\n\nNext, the team will investigate additional properties\u2014such as how their\ncreation\u2019s acoustics and thermodynamics change with pressure\u2014and look into\ncommercialization. Making the elastic spheres themselves is fairly\nstraightforward, and they think metafluids like theirs might be useful in\nrobots, as \u201cintelligent\u201d shock absorbers, or in color-changing e-inks.\n\n\u201cThe application space for these scalable, easy-to-produce metafluids is\nhuge,\u201d said Bertoldi.\n\nOf course, the team\u2019s creation is still in the research phase. There are a\nplenty of hoops yet to navigate before it shows up in products we all might\nenjoy. Still, the work adds to a growing list of metamaterials\u2014and shows the\npromise of going from solid to liquid.\n\nImage Credit: Adel Djellouli/Harvard SEAS\n\n  * Tags\n  * Future\n  * Science\n\nShare\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nReddIt\n\nEmail\n\nCopy URL\n\nJason Dorrier\n\nJason is editorial director of Singularity Hub.
