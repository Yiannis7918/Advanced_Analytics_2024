As a result, a chain of \"friend of a friend\"\nstatements can be made to connect any two people in a maximum of six steps. It\nis also known as the six handshakes rule.^[1]\n\nThe concept was originally set out in a 1929 short story by Frigyes Karinthy,\nin which a group of people play a game of trying to connect any person in the\nworld to themselves by a chain of five others. It was popularized in John\nGuare's 1990 play Six Degrees of Separation.\n\nThe idea is sometimes generalized to the average social distance being\nlogarithmic in the size of the population.\n\n## Early conceptions[edit]\n\n### Shrinking world[edit]\n\nTheories on optimal design of cities, city traffic flows, neighborhoods, and\ndemographics were in vogue after World War I. These^[citation needed]\nconjectures were expanded in 1929 by Hungarian author Frigyes Karinthy, who\npublished a volume of short stories titled Everything Is Different. One of\nthese pieces was titled \"Chains\" or \"Chain-Links\". The story investigated\u2014in\nabstract, conceptual, and fictional terms\u2014many of the problems that captivated\nfuture generations of mathematicians, sociologists, and physicists within the\nfield of network theory.^[2]^[3]\n\nTechnological advances in communications and travel enabled friendship\nnetworks to grow larger and span greater distances. In particular, Karinthy\nbelieved that the modern world was \"shrinking\" from this ever-increasing\nconnectedness of human beings. He posited that despite great physical\ndistances between the globe's individuals, the growing density of human\nnetworks made the actual social distance far smaller.^[4]\n\nAs a result of this hypothesis, Karinthy's characters believed that any two\nindividuals could be connected through at most five acquaintances. In his\nstory, the characters create a game out of this notion. He wrote:\n\n> A fascinating game grew out of this discussion. One of us suggested\n> performing the following experiment to prove that the population of the\n> Earth is closer together now than they have ever been before. We should\n> select any person from the 1.5 billion inhabitants of the Earth\u2014anyone,\n> anywhere at all. He bet us that, using no more than five individuals, one of\n> whom is a personal acquaintance, he could contact the selected individual\n> using nothing except the network of personal acquaintances.^[5]\n\nThis idea influenced a great deal of early thought on social networks, both\ndirectly and indirectly. Karinthy has been regarded as the originator of the\nnotion of six degrees of separation.^[3] A related theory deals with the\nquality of connections, rather than their existence. The theory of three\ndegrees of influence was created by Nicholas A. Christakis and James H.\nFowler.^[citation needed]\n\n### Small world[edit]\n\nMain article: Small-world experiment\n\nMichael Gurevich conducted seminal work in his empirical study of the\nstructure of social networks in his 1961 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nPhD dissertation under Ithiel de Sola Pool.^[6] Mathematician Manfred Kochen,\nan Austrian who had been involved in urban design, extrapolated these\nempirical results in a mathematical manuscript, Contacts and Influences,^[7]\nconcluding that in a U.S.-sized population without social structure, \"it is\npractically certain that any two individuals can contact one another by means\nof at most two intermediaries. In a [socially] structured population it is\nless likely but still seems probable. And perhaps for the whole world's\npopulation, probably only one more bridging individual should be needed.\" They\nsubsequently constructed Monte Carlo simulations based on Gurevich's data,\nwhich recognized that both weak and strong acquaintance links are needed to\nmodel social structure. The simulations, carried out on the relatively limited\ncomputers of 1973, were nonetheless able to predict that a more realistic\nthree degrees of separation existed across the U.S. population, foreshadowing\nthe findings of American psychologist Stanley Milgram.^[citation needed]\n\nMilgram continued Gurevich's experiments in acquaintanceship networks at\nHarvard University. Kochen and de Sola Pool's manuscript, Contacts and\nInfluences,^[8] was conceived while both were working at the University of\nParis in the early 1950s, during a time when Milgram visited and collaborated\nin their research. Their unpublished manuscript circulated among academics for\nover 20 years before publication in 1978. It formally articulated the\nmechanics of social networks, and explored the mathematical consequences of\nthese (including the degree of connectedness). The manuscript left many\nsignificant questions about networks unresolved, and one of these was the\nnumber of degrees of separation in actual social networks. Milgram took up the\nchallenge on his return from Paris, leading to the experiments reported in The\nSmall World Problem ^[9] in popular science journal Psychology Today, with a\nmore rigorous version of the paper appearing in Sociometry two years\nlater.^[10]\n\nMilgram's article made famous^[9] his 1967 set of experiments to investigate\nde Sola Pool and Kochen's \"small world problem.\" Mathematician Benoit\nMandelbrot, born in Warsaw, growing up in Poland then France, was aware of the\nStatist rule of thumb, and was also a colleague of de Sola Pool, Kochen and\nMilgram at the University of Paris during the early 1950s. (Kochen brought\nMandelbrot to work at the Institute for Advanced Study and later IBM in the\nU.S.)\n\nThis circle of researchers was fascinated by the interconnectedness and\n\"social capital\" of human networks. Milgram's study results showed that people\nin the United States seemed to be connected by approximately three friendship\nlinks, on average, without speculating on global linkages; he never actually\nused the term \"six degrees of separation\". Since the Psychology Today article\ngave the experiments wide publicity, Milgram, Kochen, and Karinthy all had\nbeen incorrectly credited as the origin of the notion of six degrees; the most\nlikely popularizer of the term \"six degrees of separation\" was John Guare, who\nattributed the concept of six degrees to Marconi.^[11]\n\n### Continued research: Small World Project[edit]\n\nIn 2003, Columbia University conducted an analogous experiment on social\nconnectedness amongst Internet email users. Their effort was named the\nColumbia Small World Project, and included 24,163 e-mail chains, aimed at 18\ntargets from 13 countries.^[12] Almost 100,000 people registered, but only 384\n(0.4%) reached the final target. Amongst the successful chains, while shorter\nlengths were more common, some reached their target after only 7, 8, 9, or 10\nsteps. Dodds et al. noted that participants (all volunteers) were strongly\nbiased towards existing models of Internet users^[Note 1] and that\nconnectedness based on professional ties was much stronger than those within\nfamilies or friendships. The authors cite \"lack of interest\" as the\npredominating factor in the high attrition rate,^[Note 2] a finding consistent\nwith earlier studies.^[13]\n\n## Research[edit]\n\nSeveral studies, such as Milgram's small-world experiment, have been conducted\nto measure this connectedness empirically. The phrase \"six degrees of\nseparation\" is often used as a synonym for the idea of the \"small world\"\nphenomenon.^[14]\n\nHowever, detractors argue that Milgram's experiment did not demonstrate such a\nlink,^[15] and the \"six degrees\" claim has been decried as an \"academic urban\nmyth\".^[13]^[16]\n\n### Computer networks[edit]\n\nIn 2001, Duncan Watts, a professor at Columbia University, attempted to\nrecreate Milgram's experiment on the Internet, using an e-mail message as the\n\"package\" that needed to be delivered, with 48,000 senders and 19 targets (in\n157 countries). Watts found that the average (though not maximum) number of\nintermediaries was around six.^[17] A 2007 study by Jure Leskovec and Eric\nHorvitz examined a data set of instant messages composed of 30 billion\nconversations among 240 million people. They found the average path length\namong Microsoft Messenger users to be 6.^[18]\n\nIt has been suggested by some commentators^[19] that interlocking networks of\ncomputer-mediated lateral communication could diffuse single messages to all\ninterested users worldwide as per the six degrees of separation principle via\ninformation routing groups, which are networks specifically designed to\nexploit this principle and lateral diffusion.\n\n### An optimal algorithm to calculate degrees of separation in social\nnetworks[edit]\n\nBakhshandeh et al.^[20] have addressed the search problem of identifying the\ndegree of separation between two users in social networks such as Twitter.\nThey have introduced new search techniques to provide optimal or near optimal\nsolutions. The experiments are performed using Twitter, and they show an\nimprovement of several orders of magnitude over greedy approaches. Their\noptimal algorithm finds an average degree of separation of 3.43 between 2\nrandom Twitter users, requiring an average of only 67 requests for information\nover the Internet to Twitter. A near-optimal solution of length 3.88 can be\nfound by making an average of 13.3 requests.\n\n## Popularization[edit]\n\nNo longer limited strictly to academic or philosophical thinking, the notion\nof six degrees recently has become influential throughout popular culture.\nFurther advances in communication technology\u2014and particularly the\nInternet\u2014have drawn great attention to social networks and human\ninterconnectedness. As a result, many popular media sources have addressed the\nterm. The following provide a brief outline of the ways such ideas have shaped\npopular culture.\n\n### Popularization of offline practice[edit]\n\n#### John Guare's Six Degrees of Separation[edit]\n\nMain articles: Six Degrees of Separation (play) and Six Degrees of Separation\n(film)\n\nAmerican playwright John Guare wrote a play in 1990 and released a 1993 film\nthat popularized it; it is Guare's most widely known work. ^[citation needed]\nThe play ruminates upon the idea that any two individuals are connected by at\nmost five others. As one of the characters states:\n\n> I read somewhere that everybody on this planet is separated by only six\n> other people. Six degrees of separation between us and everyone else on this\n> planet. The President of the United States, a gondolier in Venice, just fill\n> in the names. I find it A) extremely comforting that we're so close, and B)\n> like Chinese water torture that we're so close because you have to find the\n> right six people to make the right connection... I am bound to everyone on\n> this planet by a trail of six people.^[21]\n\nGuare, in interviews, attributed his awareness of the \"six degrees\" to\nMarconi.^[11] Although this idea had been circulating in various forms for\ndecades, it is Guare's piece that is most responsible for popularizing the\nphrase \"six degrees of separation.\"^[citation needed] Following Guare's lead,\nmany future television and film sources later incorporated the notion into\ntheir stories.^[citation needed]\n\nJ. J. Abrams, the executive producer of television series Six Degrees and\nLost, played the role of Doug in the film adaptation of this play.^[22]\n\n#### Kevin Bacon game[edit]\n\nThe game \"Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon\"^[23] was invented as a play on the\nconcept: the goal is to link any actor to Kevin Bacon through no more than six\nconnections, whereby two actors are connected if they have appeared in a movie\nor commercial together. It was created by three students at Albright College\nin Pennsylvania,^[24] who came up with the concept while watching Footloose.\nOn September 13, 2012, Google made it possible to search for any given actor's\n\"Bacon Number\" through its search engine.^[25]\n\nUpon the arrival of the 4G mobile network in the United Kingdom, Kevin Bacon\nappears in several commercials for the EE Network in which he links himself to\nseveral well known celebrities and TV shows in the UK.\n\n#### John L. Sullivan[edit]\n\nAn early version involved former world heavyweight boxing champion John L.\nSullivan, in which people asked others to \"shake the hand that shook the hand\nthat shook the hand that shook the hand of 'the great John L.'\"^[26]\n\n### Websites and software[edit]\n\n#### Internet[edit]\n\nIn 2013, Hungarian physicist Albert-L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Barab\u00e1si discovered that, on\naverage, there are 19 degrees of separation between any 2 web pages.^[27]\n\n#### Six Degrees of Wikipedia[edit]\n\nSeveral \"degrees of Wikipedia\" web services have been created, which\nautomatically provide the shortest paths between two Wikipedia articles.^[28]\n\n#### Facebook[edit]\n\nFacebook friend distances as reported in Feb 2016 ^[29]^[30]Year| Distance  \n---|---  \n2008| 5.28  \n2011| 4.74  \n2016| 4.57  \n  \nA Facebook platform application named \"Six Degrees\" was developed by Karl\nBunyan, which calculates the degrees of separation between people. It had over\n5.8 million users, as seen from the group's page. The average separation for\nall users of the application is 5.73 degrees, whereas the maximum degree of\nseparation is 12. The application has a \"Search for Connections\" window to\ninput any name of a Facebook user, to which it then shows the chain of\nconnections. In June 2009, Bunyan shut down the application, presumably for\nissues with Facebook's caching policy; specifically, the policy prohibited the\nstoring of friend lists for more than 24 hours; following this policy would\nhave made the application inaccurate.^[31] A new version of the application\nbecame available at Six Degrees after Karl Bunyan gave permission to a group\nof developers led by Todd Chaffee to re-develop the application based on\nFacebook's revised policy on caching data.^[32]^[33]\n\nThe initial version of the application was built at a Facebook Developers\nGarage London hackathon with Mark Zuckerberg in attendance.^[34]\n\nYahoo! Research Small World Experiment has been conducting an experiment and\neveryone with a Facebook account can take part in it. According to the\nresearch page, this research has the potential of resolving the still\nunresolved theory of six degrees of separation.^[23]^[35]\n\nFacebook's data team released two papers in November 2011 which document that\namongst all Facebook users at the time of research (721 million users with 69\nbillion friendship links) there is an average distance of 4.74.^[36]^[29]\nProbabilistic algorithms were applied on statistical metadata to verify the\naccuracy of the measurements.^[37] It was also found that 99.91% of Facebook\nusers were interconnected, forming a large connected component.^[38]\n\nFacebook reported that the distance had decreased to 4.57 in February 2016,\nwhen it had 1.6 billion users (about 22% of the world population).^[29]\n\n#### LinkedIn[edit]\n\nThe LinkedIn professional networking site operates the degree of separation\none is away from a person with which he or she wishes to communicate. On\nLinkedIn, one's network is made up of 1st-degree, 2nd-degree, and 3rd-degree\nconnections and fellow members of LinkedIn Groups. In addition, LinkedIn\nnotifies users how many connections they and any other user have in common.\n\n#### SixDegrees.com[edit]\n\nSixDegrees.com was an early social-networking website that existed from 1997\nto 2000. It allowed users to list friends, family members and acquaintances,\nsend messages and post bulletin board items to people in their first, second,\nand third degrees, and see their connection to any other user on the site. At\nits height, it had 3,500,000 fully registered members.^[39] However, it was\nclosed in 2000. ^[40]\n\n#### Twitter[edit]\n\nUsers on Twitter can follow other users creating a network. According to a\n2010 study of 5.2 billion such relationships by social media monitoring firm\nSysomos, the average distance on Twitter is 4.67. On average, about 50% of\npeople on Twitter are only four steps away from each other, while nearly\neveryone is five steps or less away.^[41]\n\nIn another work, researchers have shown that the average distance of 1,500\nrandom users in Twitter is 3.435. They calculated the distance between each\npair of users using all the active users in Twitter.^[42]\n\n## Mathematics[edit]\n\nMathematicians use an analogous notion of collaboration distance:^[43] two\npersons are linked if they are coauthors of an article. The collaboration\ndistance with mathematician Paul Erd\u0151s is called the Erd\u0151s number. Erd\u0151s-Bacon\nnumbers and Erd\u0151s-Bacon-Sabbath (EBS) numbers^[44] are further extensions of\nthe same thinking.\n\nWatts and Strogatz showed that the average path length (APL) between two nodes\nin a random network is equal to ln N / ln K, where N = total nodes and K =\nacquaintances per node. Thus if N = 300,000,000 (90% of the US population) and\nK = 30 then Degrees of Separation = APL = 19.5 / 3.4 = 5.7 and if N =\n7,200,000,000 (90% of the world population) and K = 30 then Degrees of\nSeparation = APL = 22.7 / 3.4 = 6.7. (It is assumed that 10% of population are\ntoo young to participate.)\n\n## Psychology[edit]\n\nA 2007 article published in The Industrial-Organizational Psychologist,^[45]\nby Jesse S. Michel from Michigan State University, applied Stanley Milgram's\nsmall world phenomenon (i.e., \"small world problem\") to the field of I-O\npsychology through co-author publication linkages. Following six criteria,\nScott Highhouse (Bowling Green State University professor and fellow of the\nSociety of Industrial and Organizational Psychology) was chosen as the target.\nCo-author publication linkages were determined for (1) top authors within the\nI-O community, (2) quasi-random faculty members of highly productive I-O\nprograms in North America, and (3) publication trends of the target. Results\nsuggest that the small world phenomenon is alive and well with mean linkages\nof 3.00 to top authors, mean linkages of 2.50 to quasi-random faculty members,\nand a relatively broad and non-repetitive set of co-author linkages for the\ntarget. The author then provided a series of implications and suggestions for\nfuture research.\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n### Films[edit]\n\n  * The Oscar-winning film Babel is based on the concept of six degrees of separation. The lives of all of the characters were intimately intertwined, although they did not know each other and lived thousands of miles from each other.\n  * Six Degrees of Separation is a 1993 drama film featuring Will Smith, Donald Sutherland, and Stockard Channing.\n\n### Games[edit]\n\n  * One of the achievements in the video game Br\u00fctal Legend is called \"Six Degrees of Schafer\", after the concept and Tim Schafer, who was presumably in the handful of players to have the achievement as of the game's release. A player can only obtain this achievement by playing online with someone who already has it, further paralleling it to the concept.\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n  * Joined-Up Thinking and Connectoscope by Stevyn Colgan are trivia books based upon the idea of \"Six Degrees\" of information; that everything is connected.\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n  * The No Doubt song \"Full Circle\" has a central theme dealing with six degrees of separation.\n  * The Weird Al song \"Lame Claim to Fame\" has the lines: \"I know a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy/Who knows a guy who knows a guy who knows Kevin Bacon\"\n  * \"Six Degrees of Separation\" is the 10th track on the second disc The Heart of the 2016 double album The Weight of These Wings by American country artist Miranda Lambert. It is the 22nd track overall.\n  * \"Six Degrees of Separation\" is the 2nd track on The Script's third album, #3.\n  * \"Six Degrees\" is the sixth track on Scouting for Girls' album, The Light Between Us.\n  * Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence is a 2002 album by progressive metal band Dream Theater.\n  * English progressive rock band Arena released an album titled The Seventh Degree of Separation in 2011.\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n  * Six Degrees is a 2006 television series on ABC in the US. The show details the experiences of six New Yorkers who go about their lives without realizing they are affecting each other, and gradually meet one another.^[46]\n  * Lonely Planet Six Degrees is a TV travel show that uses the \"six degrees of separation\" concept: The hosts, Asha Gill and Toby Amies, explore various cities through its people, by following certain personalities of the city around and being introduced by them to other personalities.\n  * The Woestijnvis production Man Bijt Hond, broadcast on Flemish TV, features a weekly section Dossier Costers, in which a worldwide event from the past week is linked to Gustaaf Costers, an ordinary Flemish citizen, in six steps.^[47]\n  * Six Degrees of Martina McBride is a television pilot wherein six aspiring country singers from America's smallest towns tried to connect themselves to Martina McBride in under six points of human connection. Those who made it from \"Nowhere to Nashville to New York,\" got both a shot at a studio session with McBride and a record deal with SONY BMG. It was not picked up as a series.\n  * \"Six Degrees of Separation\" is an episode of the reimagined Battlestar Galactica series.\n  * Six Degrees of Everything is a comedy series starring Benny Fine and Rafi Fine, in which they illustrate that everything in the world is connected by a six-degree separation.^[48]\n  * Jorden runt p\u00e5 6 steg is a seven-episode infotainment game show produced by Nexiko Media which aired on Swedish Kanal 5 in 2015. In each episode, hosts Filip Hammar and Fredrik Wikingsson selected one random elderly person (in Bolivia, Nepal, Senegal, Namibia, Mongolia, Madagascar, and Vietnam) and traced their relationships to different celebrities, including Gordon Ramsay and Buzz Aldrin, with the goal of doing so in six or fewer degrees of separation, within a time limit of one week.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Composition of relations \u2013 Mathematical operation\n  * Connections \u2013 Documentary TV series and book by James BurkePages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets, a TV documentary that follows a similar concept but involving history and science\n  * Erd\u0151s number \u2013 Closeness of someone's association with mathematician Paul Erd\u0151s\n  * Erd\u0151s\u2013Bacon number \u2013 Closeness of someone's association with mathematician Paul Erd\u0151s and actor Kevin Bacon\n  * Hyperlink cinema \u2013 Multilinear filmmaking style\n  * Jewish geography \u2013 Game amongst global Jewish community\n  * Professional network service \u2013 Type of social network\n  * Shusaku number \u2013 Closeness of someone's association with mathematician Paul Erd\u0151sPages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets\n  * Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon \u2013 Parlor game on degrees of separation\n  * SixDegrees.org \u2013 Charity led by actor, musician, and philanthropist Kevin Bacon\n  * Small-world experiment \u2013 Experiments examining the average path length for social networks\n  * Social network \u2013 Social structure made up of a set of social actors\n  * The Game (mind game) \u2013 Mental thought-suppression game\n  * The Tipping Point \u2013 2000 book by Malcolm Gladwell\n  * Three-click rule \u2013 Unofficial web design rule\n  * Six Degrees of Separation (film) \u2013 1993 film by Fred Schepisi\n  * Wikipedia:Six degrees of Wikipedia\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"More than half of all participants resided in North America and were middle class, professional, college educated, and Christian, reflecting commonly held notions of the Internet-using population\"^[12]\n  2. ^ \"suggesting lack of interest ... was the main reason\" for the \"extremely low completion rate\"^[12]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"6 Handshake Rule - Are We Still 6 People Away From Each Other?\".
