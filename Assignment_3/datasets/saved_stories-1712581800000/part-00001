It features an integrated quota management system and\na scheduler that administers a consolidated resource pool. The G\u00f6del\nscheduling system is a critical component in the management of clusters.\n\nThanks to the G\u00f6del architecture, we can realize enhanced performance in terms\nof resource utilization, resource elasticity, and scheduling throughput,\noptimizing the overall functionality and efficiency of cluster management.\n\n## Overall Architecture\n\n  * Drawing inspiration from the Kubernetes scheduler and incorporating the concept of optimistic concurrency, we have optimized the most time-intensive process of matching application nodes\u2014encompassing both filtering and scoring\u2014within the scheduler component. This approach allows for concurrent execution, enhancing the scheduling throughput for large-scale clusters.\n\n  * Our two-tiered scheduling semantic abstraction, comprising Unit and Pod, along with its framework implementation, offers a more versatile \"batch\" scheduling capability. This significantly bolsters support for offline services while simultaneously enhancing throughput and scalability.\n\n  * The system boasts a plethora of features coupled with outstanding performance, fulfilling a diverse range of business requirements including online, offline (batch, stream), and training operations, thereby achieving truly unified scheduling.\n\n  * While remaining compatible with the Kubernetes ecosystem and serving as a potential substitute for the Kubernetes scheduler, our framework distinguishes itself through performance and architectural advancements. Although the framework interface deviates slightly from that of the Kubernetes scheduler, its extensibility remains uncompromised. Scheduling plugins can be developed in a manner akin to Kubernetes.\n\n## Local G\u00f6del Environment Setup with KIND\n\nWe offered a guide to set up a local Kubernetes cluster installed with G\u00f6del.\nPlease refer to Local G\u00f6del Environment Setup with KIND for details.\n\n## Quick Start Guide for Key Features\n\nPlease refer to the below links for quick start guides on key features. Please\nnote that G\u00f6del supports Kubernetes versions from 1.21.4 up to 1.24.6. Using\nlower or higher Kubernetes versions may cause compatibility issues.\n\n  * Basic Pod Scheduling\n  * Gang Scheduling\n  * Preemption\n  * Job Level Affinity\n  * SubCluster Concurrent Scheduling\n\n## Contribution Guide\n\nPlease refer to Contribution.\n\n## About\n\nan unified scheduler for online and offline tasks\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\n### License\n\nApache-2.0 license\n\n### Code of conduct\n\nCode of conduct\n\nActivity\n\nCustom properties\n\n### Stars\n\n258 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n9 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n37 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases\n\nNo releases published\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Contributors 7\n\n## Languages\n\n  * Go 98.2%\n  * Shell 1.6%\n  * Other 0.2%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
