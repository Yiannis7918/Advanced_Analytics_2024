Short-coherence-length light can be obtained\nusing a superluminescent diode (SLD) with a broad spectral bandwidth or a\nbroadly tunable laser with narrow linewidth. The first demonstration of OCT\nimaging (in vitro) was published by a team from MIT and Harvard Medical School\nin a 1991 article in the journal Science.^[1] The article introduced the term\n\"OCT\" to credit its derivation from optical coherence-domain reflectometry, in\nwhich the axial resolution is based on temporal coherence.^[2] The first\ndemonstrations of in vivo OCT imaging quickly followed.^[3]^[4]^[5]\n\nThe first US patents on OCT by the MIT/Harvard group described both a time-\ndomain OCT (TD-OCT) system^[6]^[7] and a Fourier-domain OCT (FD-OCT) system of\nthe swept-source variety.^[6] These patents were licensed by Zeiss and formed\nthe basis of the first generations of OCT products until 2006. Tanno et al.\nobtained a patent on optical heterodyne tomography (similar to TD-OCT) in\nJapan in the same year.^[8]\n\nIn the decade preceding the invention of OCT, interferometry with short-\ncoherence-length light had been investigated for a variety of\napplications.^[9]^[10]^[11]^[12]^[13]^[14]^[15]^[16]^[17]^[18]^[19]^[20] The\npotential to use interferometry for imaging was proposed,^[20] and measurement\nof retinal elevation profile and thickness had been demonstrated.^[19]\n\nThe initial commercial clinical OCT systems were based on point-scanning TD-\nOCT technology, which primarily produced cross-sectional images due to the\nspeed limitation (tens to thousands of axial scans per second). Fourier-domain\nOCT became available clinically 2006, enabling much greater image acquisition\nrate (tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands axial scans per second)\nwithout sacrificing signal strength. The higher speed allowed for three-\ndimensional imaging, which can be visualized in both en face and cross-\nsectional views. Novel contrasts such as angiography, elastography, and\noptoretinography also became possible by detecting signal change over time.\nOver the past three decades, the speed of commercial clinical OCT systems has\nincreased more than 1000-fold, doubling every three years and rivaling Moore's\nlaw of computer chip performance. Development of parallel image acquisition\napproaches such as line-field and full-field technology may allow the\nperformance improvement trend to continue.\n\nOCT is most widely used in ophthalmology, in which it has transformed the\ndiagnosis and monitoring of retinal diseases, optic nerve diseases, and\ncorneal diseases. It has greatly improved the management of the top three\ncauses of blindness \u2013 macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma\n\u2013 thereby preventing vision loss in many patients. By 2016 OCT was estimated\nto be used in more than 30 million imaging procedures per year worldwide.^[21]\n\nOCT angioscopy is used in the intravascular evaluation of coronary artery\nplaques and to guide stent placement. Beyond ophthalmology and cardiology,\napplications are also developing in other medical specialties such as\ndermatology, gastroenterology (endoscopy), neurology, oncology, and\ndentistry.^[22]^[23]\n\n## Introduction[edit]\n\nOptical coherence tomogram of a fingertip. It is possible to observe the sweat\nglands, having \"corkscrew appearance\"\n\nInterferometric reflectometry of biological tissue, especially of the human\neye using short-coherence-length light (also referred to as partially-\ncoherent, low-coherence, or broadband, broad-spectrum, or white light) was\ninvestigated in parallel by multiple groups worldwide since 1980s. In 1991,\nDavid Huang, then a student in James Fujimoto laboratory at Massachusetts\nInstitute of Technology, working with Eric Swanson at the MIT Lincoln\nLaboratory and colleagues at the Harvard Medical School, successfully\ndemonstrated imaging and called the new imaging modality \"optical coherence\ntomography\".^[24] Since then, OCT with micrometer resolution and cross-\nsectional imaging capabilities has become a prominent biomedical imaging\ntechnique that has continually improved in technical performance and range of\napplications. The improvement in image acquisition rate is particularly\nspectacular, starting with the original 0.8 Hz axial scan repetition rate^[1]\nto the current commercial clinical OCT systems operating at several hundred\nkHz and laboratory prototypes at multiple MHz. The range of applications has\nexpanded from ophthalmology to cardiology and other medical specialties. For\ntheir roles in the invention of OCT, Fujimoto, Huang, and Swanson received the\n2023 Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award and the National Medal of\nTechnology and Innovation.^[25] These developments have been reviewed in\narticles written for the general^[21] scientific^[26] and medical^[27]\nreadership.\n\nIt is particularly suited to ophthalmic applications and other tissue imaging\nrequiring micrometer resolution and millimeter penetration depth.^[28] OCT has\nalso been used for various art conservation projects, where it is used to\nanalyze different layers in a painting. OCT has interesting advantages over\nother medical imaging systems. Medical ultrasonography, magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI), confocal microscopy, and OCT are differently suited to\nmorphological tissue imaging: while the first two have whole body but low\nresolution imaging capability (typically a fraction of a millimeter), the\nthird one can provide images with resolutions well below 1 micrometer (i.e.\nsub-cellular), between 0 and 100 micrometers in depth, and the fourth can\nprobe as deep as 500 micrometers, but with a lower (i.e. architectural)\nresolution (around 10 micrometers in lateral and a few micrometers in depth in\nophthalmology, for instance, and 20 micrometers in lateral in\nendoscopy).^[29]^[30]\n\nOCT is based on low-coherence interferometry.^[31]^[32]^[33] In conventional\ninterferometry with long coherence length (i.e., laser interferometry),\ninterference of light occurs over a distance of meters. In OCT, this\ninterference is shortened to a distance of micrometers, owing to the use of\nbroad-bandwidth light sources (i.e., sources that emit light over a broad\nrange of frequencies). Light with broad bandwidths can be generated by using\nsuperluminescent diodes or lasers with extremely short pulses (femtosecond\nlasers). White light is an example of a broadband source with lower power.\n\nLight in an OCT system is broken into two arms \u2013 a sample arm (containing the\nitem of interest) and a reference arm (usually a mirror). The combination of\nreflected light from the sample arm and reference light from the reference arm\ngives rise to an interference pattern, but only if light from both arms have\ntraveled the \"same\" optical distance (\"same\" meaning a difference of less than\na coherence length). By scanning the mirror in the reference arm, a\nreflectivity profile of the sample can be obtained (this is time domain OCT).\nAreas of the sample that reflect back a lot of light will create greater\ninterference than areas that don't. Any light that is outside the short\ncoherence length will not interfere.^[34] This reflectivity profile, called an\nA-scan, contains information about the spatial dimensions and location of\nstructures within the item of interest. A cross-sectional tomogram (B-scan)\nmay be achieved by laterally combining a series of these axial depth scans\n(A-scan). A face imaging at an acquired depth is possible depending on the\nimaging engine used.\n\n## Layperson's explanation[edit]\n\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

It is effectively \"optical ultrasound\", imaging reflections\nfrom within tissue to provide cross-sectional images.^[35]\n\nOCT has attracted interest among the medical community because it provides\ntissue morphology imagery at much higher resolution (less than 10 \u03bcm axially\nand less than 20 \u03bcm laterally^[36] ) than other imaging modalities such as MRI\nor ultrasound.\n\nThe key benefits of OCT are:\n\n  * Live sub-surface images at near-microscopic resolution\n  * Instant, direct imaging of tissue morphology\n  * No preparation of the sample or subject, no contact\n  * No ionizing radiation\n\nOCT delivers high resolution because it is based on light, rather than sound\nor radio frequency. An optical beam is directed at the tissue, and a small\nportion of this light that reflects from sub-surface features is collected.\nNote that most light is not reflected but, rather, scatters off at large\nangles. In conventional imaging, this diffusely scattered light contributes\nbackground that obscures an image. However, in OCT, a technique called\ninterferometry is used to record the optical path length of received photons\nallowing rejection of most photons that scatter multiple times before\ndetection. Thus OCT can build up clear 3D images of thick samples by rejecting\nbackground signal while collecting light directly reflected from surfaces of\ninterest.\n\nWithin the range of noninvasive three-dimensional imaging techniques that have\nbeen introduced to the medical research community, OCT as an echo technique is\nsimilar to ultrasound imaging. Other medical imaging techniques such as\ncomputerized axial tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or positron\nemission tomography do not use the echo-location principle.^[37]\n\nThe technique is limited to imaging 1 to 2 mm below the surface in biological\ntissue, because at greater depths the proportion of light that escapes without\nscattering is too small to be detected. No special preparation of a biological\nspecimen is required, and images can be obtained \"non-contact\" or through a\ntransparent window or membrane. It is also important to note that the laser\noutput from the instruments used is low \u2013 eye-safe near-infrared or visible-\nlight^[38] \u2013 and no damage to the sample is therefore likely.\n\n## Theory[edit]\n\nThe principle of OCT is white light, or low coherence, interferometry. The\noptical setup typically consists of an interferometer (Fig. 1, typically\nMichelson type) with a low coherence, broad bandwidth light source. Light is\nsplit into and recombined from reference and sample arms, respectively.\n\nFig. 1 Full-field OCT optical setup. Components include: super-luminescent\ndiode (SLD), convex lens (L1), 50/50 beamsplitter (BS), camera objective (CO),\nCMOS-DSP camera (CAM), reference (REF), and sample (SMP). The camera functions\nas a two-dimensional detector array, and with the OCT technique facilitating\nscanning in depth, a non-invasive three-dimensional imaging device is\nachieved.| Fig. 2 Typical optical setup of single point OCT. Scanning the\nlight beam on the sample enables non-invasive cross-sectional imaging up to 3\nmm in depth with micrometer resolution.  \n---|---  \nFig. 3 Spectral discrimination by swept-source OCT. Components include: swept\nsource or tunable laser (SS), beamsplitter (BS), reference mirror (REF),\nsample (SMP), photodetector (PD), and digital signal processing (DSP)| Fig. 4\nSpectral discrimination by Fourier-domain OCT. Components include: low\ncoherence source (LCS), beamsplitter (BS), reference mirror (REF), sample\n(SMP), diffraction grating (DG) and full-field detector (CAM) acting as a\nspectrometer, and digital signal processing (DSP)  \n  \n### Time domain[edit]\n\nIn time domain OCT the path length of the reference arm is varied in time (the\nreference mirror is translated longitudinally). A property of low coherence\ninterferometry is that interference, i.e. the series of dark and bright\nfringes, is only achieved when the path difference lies within the coherence\nlength of the light source. This interference is called autocorrelation in a\nsymmetric interferometer (both arms have the same reflectivity), or cross-\ncorrelation in the common case. The envelope of this modulation changes as\npath length difference is varied, where the peak of the envelope corresponds\nto path length matching.\n\nThe interference of two partially coherent light beams can be expressed in\nterms of the source intensity, , as\n\nwhere represents the interferometer beam splitting ratio, and is called the\ncomplex degree of coherence, i.e. the interference envelope and carrier\ndependent on reference arm scan or time delay , and whose recovery is of\ninterest in OCT. Due to the coherence gating effect of OCT the complex degree\nof coherence is represented as a Gaussian function expressed as^[33]\n\nwhere represents the spectral width of the source in the optical frequency\ndomain, and is the centre optical frequency of the source. In equation (2),\nthe Gaussian envelope is amplitude modulated by an optical carrier. The peak\nof this envelope represents the location of the microstructure of the sample\nunder test, with an amplitude dependent on the reflectivity of the surface.\nThe optical carrier is due to the Doppler effect resulting from scanning one\narm of the interferometer, and the frequency of this modulation is controlled\nby the speed of scanning. Therefore, translating one arm of the interferometer\nhas two functions; depth scanning and a Doppler-shifted optical carrier are\naccomplished by pathlength variation. In OCT, the Doppler-shifted optical\ncarrier has a frequency expressed as\n\nwhere is the central optical frequency of the source, is the scanning velocity\nof the pathlength variation, and is the speed of light.\n\nThe axial and lateral resolutions of OCT are decoupled from one another; the\nformer being an equivalent to the coherence length of the light source and the\nlatter being a function of the optics. The axial resolution of OCT is defined\nas\n\nwhere and are respectively the central wavelength and the spectral width of\nthe light source.^[39]\n\n### Fourier domain[edit]\n\ninterference signals in TD vs. FD-OCT\n\nFourier-domain (or Frequency-domain) OCT (FD-OCT) has speed and signal-to-\nnoise ratio (SNR) advantages over time-domain OCT (TD-OCT) and has become the\nstandard in the industry since 2006. The idea of using frequency modulation\nand coherent detection to obtain ranging information was already demonstrated\nin optical frequency domain reflectometry^[9] and laser radar^[14] in the\n1980s, though the distance resolution and range were much longer than OCT.\nThere are two types of FD-OCT \u2013 swept-source OCT (SS-OCT) and spectral-domain\nOCT (SD-OCT) \u2013 both of which acquire spectral interferograms which are then\nFourier transformed to obtain an axial scan of reflectance amplitude versus\ndepth. In SS-OCT, the spectral interferogram is acquired sequentially by\ntuning the wavelength of a laser light source. SD-OCT acquires spectral\ninterferogram simultaneously in a spectrometer. An implementation of SS-OCT\nwas described by the MIT group as early as 1994.^[6]^[40] A group based in the\nUniversity of Vienna described measurement of intraocular distance using both\ntunable laser and spectrometer-based interferometry as early as\n1995.^[41]^[42] SD-OCT imaging was first demonstrated both in vitro and in\nvivo by a collaboration between the Vienna group and a group based in the\nNicholas Copernicus University in a series of articles between 2000 and\n2002.^[43]^[44]^[45] The SNR advantage of FD-OCT over TD-OCT was analyzed by\nmultiple groups of researchers in 2003.^[46]^[47]^[48]\n\n#### Spectral-domain OCT[edit]\n\nSpectral-domain OCT (spatially encoded frequency domain OCT) extracts spectral\ninformation by distributing different optical frequencies onto a detector\nstripe (line-array CCD or CMOS) via a dispersive element (see Fig. 4). Thereby\nthe information of the full depth scan can be acquired within a single\nexposure. However, the large signal-to-noise advantage of FD-OCT is reduced\ndue to the lower dynamic range of stripe detectors with respect to single\nphotosensitive diodes, resulting in an SNR advantage of ~10 dB at much higher\nspeeds. This is not much of a problem when working at 1300 nm, however, since\ndynamic range is not a serious problem at this wavelength range.^[39]\n\nThe drawbacks of this technology are found in a strong fall-off of the SNR,\nwhich is proportional to the distance from the zero delay and a sinc-type\nreduction of the depth-dependent sensitivity because of limited detection\nlinewidth. (One pixel detects a quasi-rectangular portion of an optical\nfrequency range instead of a single frequency, the Fourier transform leads to\nthe sinc(z) behavior). Additionally, the dispersive elements in the\nspectroscopic detector usually do not distribute the light equally spaced in\nfrequency on the detector, but mostly have an inverse dependence. Therefore,\nthe signal has to be resampled before processing, which cannot take care of\nthe difference in local (pixelwise) bandwidth, which results in further\nreduction of the signal quality. However, the fall-off is not a serious\nproblem with the development of new generation CCD or photodiode array with a\nlarger number of pixels.\n\nSynthetic array heterodyne detection offers another approach to this problem\nwithout the need for high dispersion.\n\n#### Swept-source OCT[edit]\n\nSwept-source OCT (Time-encoded frequency domain OCT) tries to combine some of\nthe advantages of standard TD and spectral domain OCT. Here the spectral\ncomponents are not encoded by spatial separation, but they are encoded in\ntime. The spectrum is either filtered or generated in single successive\nfrequency steps and reconstructed before Fourier transformation. By\naccommodation of a frequency scanning light source (i.e. frequency scanning\nlaser) the optical setup (see Fig. 3) becomes simpler than spectral domain\nOCT, but the problem of scanning is essentially translated from the TD-OCT\nreference arm into the swept source OCT light source. Here the advantage lies\nin the proven high SNR detection technology, while swept laser sources achieve\nvery small instantaneous bandwidths (linewidths) at very high frequencies\n(20\u2013200 kHz). Drawbacks are the nonlinearities in the wavelength (especially\nat high scanning frequencies), the broadening of the linewidth at high\nfrequencies and a high sensitivity to movements of the scanning geometry or\nthe sample (below the range of nanometers within successive frequency steps).\n\n## Scanning schemes[edit]\n\nFocusing the light beam to a point on the surface of the sample under test,\nand recombining the reflected light with the reference will yield an\ninterferogram with sample information corresponding to a single A-scan (Z axis\nonly). Scanning of the sample can be accomplished by either scanning the light\non the sample, or by moving the sample under test. A linear scan will yield a\ntwo-dimensional data set corresponding to a cross-sectional image (X-Z axes\nscan), whereas an area scan achieves a three-dimensional data set\ncorresponding to a volumetric image (X-Y-Z axes scan).\n\n### Single point[edit]\n\nSystems based on single point, confocal, or flying-spot time domain OCT, must\nscan the sample in two lateral dimensions and reconstruct a three-dimensional\nimage using depth information obtained by coherence-gating through an axially\nscanning reference arm (Fig. 2). Two-dimensional lateral scanning has been\nelectromechanically implemented by moving the sample^[49] using a translation\nstage, and using a novel micro-electro-mechanical system scanner.^[50]\n\n### Line-field OCT[edit]\n\nLine-field confocal optical coherence tomography (LC-OCT) is an imaging\ntechnique based on the principle of time-domain OCT with line illumination\nusing a broadband laser and line detection using a line-scan camera.^[51] LC-\nOCT produces B-scans in real-time from multiple A-scans acquired in parallel.\nEn face as well as three-dimensional images can also be obtained by scanning\nthe illumination line laterally.^[52]^[53] The focus is continuously adjusted\nduring the scan of the sample depth, using a high numerical aperture (NA)\nmicroscope objective to image with high lateral resolution. By using a\nsupercontinuum laser as a light source, a quasi-isotropic spatial resolution\nof ~ 1 \u03bcm is achieved at a central wavelength of ~ 800 nm. On the other hand,\nline illumination and detection, combined with the use of a high NA microscope\nobjective, produce a confocal gate that prevents most scattered light that\ndoes not contribute to the signal from being detected by the camera. This\nconfocal gate, which is absent in the full-field OCT technique, gives LC-OCT\nan advantage in terms of detection sensitivity and penetration in highly\nscattering media such as skin tissues.^[54] So far this technique has been\nused mainly for skin imaging in the fields of\ndermatology^[55]^[56]^[57]^[58]^[59]^[60] and cosmetology.^[61]\n\n### Full-field OCT[edit]\n\nSchematic view of a full-field OCT\n\nAn imaging approach to temporal OCT was developed by Claude Boccara's team in\n1998,^[62] with an acquisition of the images without beam scanning. In this\ntechnique called full-field OCT (FF-OCT), unlike other OCT techniques that\nacquire cross-sections of the sample, the images are here \"en-face\" i.e. like\nimages of classical microscopy: orthogonal to the light beam of\nillumination.^[63]\n\nMore precisely, interferometric images are created by a Michelson\ninterferometer where the path length difference is varied by a fast electric\ncomponent (usually a piezo mirror in the reference arm). These images acquired\nby a CCD camera are combined in post-treatment (or online) by the phase shift\ninterferometry method, where usually 2 or 4 images per modulation period are\nacquired, depending on the algorithm used.^[64]^[65] More recently, approaches\nthat allow rapid single-shot imaging were developed to simultaneously capture\nmultiple phase-shifted images required for reconstruction, using single\ncamera.^[66] Single-shot time-domain OCM is limited only by the camera frame\nrate and available illumination.\n\nThe \"en-face\" tomographic images are thus produced by a wide-field\nillumination, ensured by the Linnik configuration of the Michelson\ninterferometer where a microscope objective is used in both arms. Furthermore,\nwhile the temporal coherence of the source must remain low as in classical OCT\n(i.e. a broad spectrum), the spatial coherence must also be low to avoid\nparasitical interferences (i.e. a source with a large size).^[67]\n\n## Selected applications[edit]\n\nOptical coherence tomography is an established medical imaging technique and\nis used across several medical specialties including ophthalmology and\ncardiology, and is widely used in basic science research applications.\n\n### Ophthalmology[edit]\n\nOcular (or ophthalmic) OCT is used heavily by ophthalmologists and\noptometrists to obtain high-resolution images of the retina and anterior\nsegment. Owing to OCT's capability to show cross-sections of tissue layers\nwith micrometer resolution, OCT provides a straightforward method of assessing\ncellular organization, photoreceptor integrity,^[68]^[69]^[70]^[71] and axonal\nthickness in glaucoma,^[72] macular degeneration,^[73] diabetic macular\nedema,^[74] multiple sclerosis,^[75] optic neuritis,^[76] and other eye\ndiseases or systemic pathologies which have ocular signs.^[77] Additionally,\nophthalmologists leverage OCT to assess the vascular health of the retina via\na technique called OCT angiography (OCTA).^[78] In ophthalmological surgery,\nespecially retinal surgery, an OCT can be mounted on the microscope. Such a\nsystem is called an intraoperative OCT (iOCT) and provides support during the\nsurgery with clinical benefits.^[79]^[80]^[81] Polarization-sensitive OCT was\nrecently applied in the human retina to determine optical polarization\nproperties of vessel walls near the optic nerve.^[82]\n\n### Cardiology and neurovascular applications[edit]\n\nMain article: Intracoronary optical coherence tomography\n\nIn the settings of cardiology, OCT is used to image coronary arteries to\nvisualize vessel wall lumen morphology and microstructure at a resolution ~10\ntimes higher than other existing modalities such as intravascular ultrasounds,\nand x-ray angiography (intracoronary optical coherence tomography). For this\ntype of application, 1 mm in diameter or smaller fiber-optics catheters are\nused to access artery lumen through semi-invasive interventions such as\npercutaneous coronary interventions.\n\nThe first demonstration of endoscopic OCT was reported in 1997, by researchers\nin James Fujimoto laboratory at Massachusetts Institute of Technology,\nincluding Guillermo James Tearney and Brett Bouma.^[83] The first TD-OCT\nimaging catheter and system was commercialized by LightLab Imaging, Inc., a\ncompany based in Massachusetts in 2006. The first FD-OCT imaging study was\nreported by Massachusetts General Hospital in 2008.^[84] Intracoronary FD-OCT\nwas first introduced in the market in 2009 by LightLab Imaging, Inc.^[85]\nfollowed by Terumo Corporation in 2012 and by Gentuity LLC in 2020.^[86] The\nhigher acquisition speed of FD-OCT enabled the widespread adoption of this\nimaging technology for coronary artery imaging. It is estimated that over\n100,000 FD-OCT coronary imaging cases are performed yearly, and that the\nmarket is increasing by approximately 20% every year.^[87]\n\nIntravascular OCT has been further investigated for use in neurovascular\napplications including imaging for guiding endovascular treatment of ischemic\nstroke and brain aneurysms.^[88] Clinical use of existing technologies has\nbeen limited to proximal intracranial anatomy of patient with limited\ntortuosity, however, it showed the potential of OCT for the imaging of\nneurovascular disease.^[89] An intravascular OCT imaging catheter design\ntailored for use in tortuous neurovascular anatomy has been proposed in\n2020.^[90]\n\nFurther developments of intravascular OCT included the combination with other\noptical imaging modalities (multi-modality imaging). OCT has been combined\nwith near-infrared fluorescence molecular imaging (NIRF) to enhance its\ncapability to detect molecular/functional and tissue morphological information\nsimultaneously.^[91]^[92] In a similar way, combination with near-infrared\nspectroscopy (NIRS) has been implemented.^[93]\n\nRetinal imaging with PS-OCT demonstrated how the thickness and birefringence\nof blood vessel wall tissue of healthy subjects could be quantified, in\nvivo.^[94] PS-OCT was subsequently applied to patients with diabetes and age-\nmatched healthy subjects, and showed an almost 100% increase in vessel wall\nbirefringence due to diabetes, without a significant change in vessel wall\nthickness.^[95] In patients with hypertension however, the retinal vessel wall\nthickness increased by 60% while the vessel wall birefringence dropped by 20%,\non average.^[96] The large differences measured in healthy subjects and\npatients suggest that retinal measurements with PS-OCT could be used as a\nscreening tool for hypertension and diabetes.^[95]^[96]^[97]\n\n### Oncology[edit]\n\nEndoscopic OCT has been applied to the detection and diagnosis of cancer and\nprecancerous lesions, such as Barrett's esophagus and esophageal\ndysplasia.^[98]^[99]^[100]\n\n### Dermatology[edit]\n\nThe first use of OCT in dermatology dates back to 1997.^[101] Since then, OCT\nhas been applied to the diagnosis of various skin lesions including\ncarcinomas.^[102]^[103]^[104] However, the diagnosis of melanoma using\nconventional OCT is difficult, especially due to insufficient imaging\nresolution.^[105] Emerging high-resolution OCT techniques such as LC-OCT have\nthe potential to improve the clinical diagnostic process, allowing for the\nearly detection of malignant skin tumors \u2013 including melanoma \u2013 and a\nreduction in the number of surgical excisions of benign lesions.^[106] Other\npromising areas of application include the imaging of lesions where excisions\nare hazardous or impossible and the guidance of surgical interventions through\nidentification of tumor margins.\n\n### Dentistry[edit]\n\nResearchers in Tokyo medical and Dental University were able to detect enamel\nwhite spot lesions around and beneath the orthodontic brackets using swept\nsource OCT.^[107]\n\n### Research applications[edit]\n\nResearchers have used OCT to produce detailed images of mice brains, through a\n\"window\" made of zirconia that has been modified to be transparent and\nimplanted in the skull.^[108]^[109] Optical coherence tomography is also\napplicable and increasingly used in industrial applications, such as\nnondestructive testing (NDT), material thickness measurements,^[110] and in\nparticular thin silicon wafers^[111]^[112] and compound semiconductor wafers\nthickness measurements^[113]^[114] surface roughness characterization, surface\nand cross-section imaging^[115]^[116] and volume loss measurements.^[117] OCT\nsystems with feedback can be used to control manufacturing processes. With\nhigh speed data acquisition,^[118] and sub-micron resolution, OCT is adaptable\nto perform both inline and off-line.^[119] Due to the high volume of produced\npills, an interesting field of application is in the pharmaceutical industry\nto control the coating of tablets.^[120] Fiber-based OCT systems are\nparticularly adaptable to industrial environments.^[121] These can access and\nscan interiors of hard-to-reach spaces,^[122] and are able to operate in\nhostile environments\u2014whether radioactive, cryogenic, or very hot.^[123] Novel\noptical biomedical diagnostic and imaging technologies are currently being\ndeveloped to solve problems in biology and medicine.^[124] As of 2014,\nattempts have been made to use optical coherence tomography to identify root\ncanals in teeth, specifically canal in the maxillary molar, however, there is\nno difference with the current methods of dental operatory\nmicroscope.^[125]^[126]^[non-primary source needed] Research conducted in 2015\nwas successful in utilizing a smartphone as an OCT platform, although much\nwork remains to be done before such a platform would be commercially\nviable.^[127] Photonic integrated circuits may be a promising option to\nminiaturized OCT. Similarly to integrated circuits silicon-based fabrication\ntechniques can be used to produce miniaturized photonic systems. First in vivo\nhuman retinal imaging has been reported recently.^[128] In 3D\nmicrofabrication, OCT enables non-destructive testing and real-time inspection\nduring additive manufacturing. Its high-resolution imaging detects defects,\ncharacterizes material properties and ensures the integrity of internal\ngeometries without damaging the part.^[117]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Angle-resolved low-coherence interferometry\n  * Ballistic photon\n  * Confocal microscopy\n  * Dual-axis optical coherence tomography\n  * Interferometry\n  * Intracoronary optical coherence tomography\n  * Leica Microsystems\n  * Medical imaging\n  * Novacam Technologies\n  * Optical heterodyne detection\n  * Optical projection tomography\n  * Spectroscopic optical coherence tomography\n  * Terahertz tomography\n  * Tomography\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b Huang D, Swanson EA, Lin CP, Schuman JS, Stinson WG, Chang W, et al.
