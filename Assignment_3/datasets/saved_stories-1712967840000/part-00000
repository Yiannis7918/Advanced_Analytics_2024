Israel staged its\ndefence the following day, claiming that \u2018if there were acts of genocide, they\nhave been perpetrated against Israel.\u2019 Its lawyers called on the court to\ndismiss the case and reject South Africa\u2019s request that military operations\nagainst Gaza be halted.\n\nLess than two hours after Israel concluded its case, Germany announced that it\nwould intervene as a \u2018third party\u2019, siding with Israel. Any signatory to the\n1948 Genocide Convention can put forward \u2018substantive arguments\u2019 in a dispute\nover the interpretation of the treaty. In 2023, Germany intervened in the\ngenocide case brought by Gambia against Myanmar for its treatment of the\nRohingya, in support of the view that Myanmar\u2019s actions constituted genocide.\nIn the South African case, a German government spokesman declared that \u2018in\nlight of Germany\u2019s history and the crime of humanity \u2013 the Shoah \u2013 the federal\ngovernment sees itself as particularly committed to the Genocide Convention.\u2019\nIn other words, it had expertise in such questions, and the current\naccusations against Israel had \u2018no basis whatsoever\u2019: they were merely an\nattempt to politicise the convention. The memory of the Holocaust is\nconsidered to be the moral foundation of postwar Germany, and the defence of\nIsrael\u2019s security, as Angela Merkel affirmed in 2008, is Germany\u2019s\nStaatsr\u00e4son. The idea that Israel can be accused of perpetrating a genocide \u2013\nor that any genocide can be compared to the Holocaust \u2013 is therefore heresy.\n\nOn 13 January, the day after the German announcement, the president of\nNamibia, Hage Geingob (who died on 4 February), rebuked Germany, arguing that\nit \u2018cannot morally express commitment to the UN Convention on Genocide ...\nwhile supporting the equivalent of a holocaust and genocide in Gaza\u2019. He added\nthat \u2018the German government is yet to fully atone for the genocide it\ncommitted on Namibian soil.\u2019 Tlaleng Mofokeng, the South African UN special\nrapporteur on the right to health, summed up the situation: \u2018The state that\ncommitted more than one genocide throughout its history [Germany] is trying to\nundermine the efforts of a country that is a victim of colonialism and\napartheid [South Africa] to protect another genocide [Israel\u2019s].\u2019 Two weeks\nlater, on 26 January, by fifteen judges to two, the ICJ accepted that the\nallegation that Israel was in violation of the 1948 convention was plausible,\nand ordered it to take measures to prevent genocidal acts.\n\nMofokeng\u2019s allusion to Germany having been responsible for \u2018more than one\ngenocide\u2019 was echoed by a curious historical coincidence. The date of the\nsecond day of the hearing and of Germany\u2019s intervention \u2013 12 January \u2013 was the\n120th anniversary of the events that put into motion the first genocide of the\n20th century, which was perpetrated by Germany\u2019s colonial army, the\nSchutztruppe. The targets were the Ovaherero (often referred to in European\nsources as Herero) and Nama peoples in a territory Germany had claimed and\ncolonised as South-West Africa \u2013 what is now called Namibia. The region had\nbeen ceded to Germany by the other European powers at the Berlin Conference of\n1884-85, which formalised the partition of Africa. Bismarck\u2019s Second Reich\nsought the colonial empire it believed its power on the world stage merited,\nand the territories covering what are now Togo, Cameroon, Tanzania, Rwanda,\nBurundi and Namibia were established as German \u2018protectorates\u2019.\n\nOn 12 January 1904, fighting broke out in the town of Okahandja between German\ntroops and Ovaherero fighters led by Samuel Maharero. More than a hundred\nsoldiers and settlers, mostly farmers and missionaries, were killed in the\nfollowing days and the Schutztruppe was forced to retreat. Humiliated, Germany\nstarted to plan retribution. The Ovaherero were cattle herders whose lands\nwere located in the region\u2019s central plateau. These fertile hills were late to\nbe colonised and had escaped the worst of the Atlantic slave trade because the\nsand dunes that stretch for hundreds of miles along the coast hid them from\nthe view of European seafarers on their way to the Cape. In the Nama/Damara\nlanguage, namib means \u2018shield\u2019. But once the German protectorate was\nestablished, the region became an ideal candidate for what in 1897 the German\ngeographer Friedrich Ratzel termed Lebensraum \u2013 the space that was needed to\nsustain a species or people in their Darwinian struggle for survival. To allow\nGerman settlement, Indigenous peoples had to be moved out of the way. At first\nthe land was taken piecemeal by enforced protection contracts and sales\nagreements, threats, bribes and massacres, but gradually German Africa came\ninto existence as a matrix of farms, missionary outposts, mineral and diamond\nmines, and military forts like the one in Okahandja. Ratzel believed that\nSouth-West Africa was a place where the \u2018German race\u2019 could harden its\ncharacter. He took his inspiration from Frederick Jackson Turner, who argued\nthat American political and cultural identity had largely been formed, half a\ncentury earlier, by the experiences of the rugged Western frontier. The\nAfrican frontier was similarly inhabited by people seen as subhuman, part of\nthe natural environment, who could be exploited, expelled or exterminated at\nwill.\n\nIn June 1904, General Lothar von Trotha, a Saxon colonial officer who had\nbuilt his reputation by helping to crush the Boxer Rebellion in China, arrived\nin South-West Africa to oversee the Schutztruppe\u2019s revenge war against the\nOvaherero. Trotha argued for \u2018absolute terrorism\u2019, and vowed to \u2018destroy the\nrebellious tribes by shedding rivers of blood\u2019. In August 1904 an estimated\nthirty thousand Ovaherero took refuge around the homesteads of the Kambazembi\nclan, at the foot of the mountain plateau of Waterberg. The Schutztruppe\nformed a bulwark to prevent the Ovaherero from fleeing westwards, forcing men,\nwomen and children into the Kalahari desert, where many were hunted down and\nshot. On 2 October, in front of his troops, Trotha issued an infamous\nextermination order:\n\n> The Herero are no longer German subjects. They have murdered and stolen,\n> they have cut off the ears, noses and other body parts of wounded soldiers\n> ... The Herero people must ... leave the land. If the populace does not do\n> this I will force them with the Groot Rohr [a cannon]. Within the German\n> borders every Herero, with or without a gun, with or without cattle, will be\n> shot. I will no longer accept women and children, I will drive them back to\n> their people or I will let them be shot at.\n\nClose to the site of Trotha\u2019s genocidal proclamation, in a place that became\nknown as Ozombu Zo Vindimba (\u2018wells of skin disease\u2019 in Otjiherero), many\nOvaherero died a slow and excruciating death after drinking water from wells\nthat had been poisoned by German troops. A great many others succumbed to\nthirst and starvation in the desert. Those who survived did so through their\nintimate knowledge of the terrain, of where and how to find groundwater. Some\nmanaged to find relative safety across the border in British Bechuanaland,\ncontemporary Botswana.\n\nThe Nama and Ovaherero traditional leaders date the start of the genocide not\nto the attack in Waterberg but to a little-known raid eleven years earlier. On\n12 April 1893 a contingent of Schutztruppe attacked the Nama settlement of\n||N\u00e2\u2021g\u00e2s \u2013 known in German as Hornkranz. It was the seat of Hendrik Witbooi,\nchief of the Witbooi Nama people. The territory between the Nama and the\nOvaherero to the north was disputed, and skirmishes were not uncommon, but\nWitbooi turned down all German offers of protection, insisting that local\npeoples should be allowed to deal with their own problems. When in 1886 he was\napproached by German emissaries sent by the colonial administrator, Heinrich\nG\u00f6ring, he refused to negotiate with anyone but the emperor himself. \u2018I\nunderstand that you want to negotiate peace, you who call yourself a\n\u201cdeputy\u201d,\u2019 he responded. \u2018How shall I respond? You are someone else\u2019s\nrepresentative, and I am a free and autonomous man answering to none but God.\u2019\nWitbooi kept a diary that gives an important African perspective on the\nexperience of German colonisation.\n\nThe Nama were skilled fighters and small groups on horseback frequently\nambushed the German convoys that trespassed into their lands. Cartographers\nwere unable to enter the area and it remained blank on the map. The Germans\nconcluded that the only way to stop the \u2018rebellious natives\u2019 was to eradicate\nthem. The Schutztruppe approached undetected at night and attacked at dawn,\nforcing the Witbooi fighters to retreat. The German soldiers razed the\nsettlement, murdering women, children and the elderly. A police station and a\nfarm were established in the ruins.\n\nIn the years that followed, Nama tribes continued to join battle against the\nGermans. On 22 April 1905, Trotha issued another extermination order, this\ntime against the Nama: \u2018The few who do not submit will suffer the same fate as\nthe Herero people, who in their delusion also believed that they could defeat\nthe powerful German emperor and the great German people. I ask you, where are\nthe Herero today?\u2019 By this time, the German government had rescinded Trotha\u2019s\nextermination order against the Ovaherero, which had damaged Germany\u2019s\nreputation in Europe. The order against the Nama was never officially revoked.\n\nNama and Ovaherero survivors were sent to concentration camps, where they were\nexploited for slave labour to build the colony\u2019s roads, railways, farms and\nadministrative outposts. More than half the prisoners died in their first year\nof captivity. One camp was on Shark Island, a windy and exposed peninsula near\nthe South Atlantic port of L\u00fcderitz that breaks the endless miles of sand\ndunes to create a small bay. This was the first anchorage made by Portuguese\nseafarers in the 15th century. On Shark Island, captives were starved, beaten,\nraped and executed. Women were forced to boil heads severed from the corpses \u2013\nwhich sometimes belonged to their own relatives \u2013 and scrape off the flesh\nwith glass so that the skulls could be sent to museums, universities and\nanthropological collections in Germany. Shark Island is often referred to by\ndescendants of the survivors as the first extermination camp. Up to 80 per\ncent of the prisoners there died.\n\nBy the end of the German campaign, in 1908, more than 65,000 Ovaherero, more\nthan two-thirds of the population, and 10,000 Nama, around half the\npopulation, had been killed. Their ancestral lands were not returned to the\nsurvivors. Instead, some former officers in the Schutztruppe, including those\nwho had participated in the genocide, were rewarded with farms on their\nvictims\u2019 land. In 1902, less than 1 per cent of South-West Africa was owned by\nEuropeans; after the genocide the figure was more than 20 per cent. The German\nsettlers\u2019 possession of the land was respected when South Africa, a dominion\nof the British Empire, occupied South-West Africa during the First World War:\naffinities between European colonial nations trumped wartime animosity.\nEuropeans farmed the fertile areas, while the Indigenous peoples were confined\nto Bantustans in areas affected by drought. This structure of land ownership\nremained in place after independence from South Africa and the foundation of\nNamibia in 1990.\n\nToday, 44 per cent of Namibia\u2019s land area, and 70 per cent of its agricultural\nland, is owned by 4500 European farmers who make up 0.3 per cent of the\npopulation. The Ovaherero and Nama descendants of the genocide victims have\nfounded towns in their \u2018ethnic homelands\u2019 that bear the names of their\nancestral homesteads, and have kept alive their demands for reparations from\nGermany and the right of return to their lands.\n\nThe Ovaherero Traditional Authority (OTA) and the Nama Traditional Leaders\nAssociation (NTLA) wholeheartedly supported the South African case against\nIsrael and expressed their solidarity with the Palestinians. \u2018We the Nama and\nOvaherero people are all too familiar with the relation between settler\ncolonialism and genocide, with the way genocide emerges as a direct\nconsequence, and culmination, of violent settler colonialism,\u2019 their statement\nran. But they also accused the Namibian president of \u2018hypocrisy at its highest\nlevel\u2019, for continuing \u2018to play an adverse role in the quest of the Nama and\nOvaherero people to achieve justice\u2019. There has been a long-standing dispute\nbetween the communities affected by the genocide and the Swapo-led government,\nwhose power base is the Ovambo people and other ethnic groups in northern\nNamibia, and whose history is tied not to German colonialism but to the armed\nliberation struggle against apartheid, in which Swapo took the lead alongside\nthe ANC. The government\u2019s nationalisation of memory meant that the \u2018Ovaherero\nand Nama genocide\u2019 became known anachronistically as the \u2018Namibian genocide\u2019.\nThe dispute was over the significance of the genocide to Namibian history \u2013\nGeingob claimed that \u2018apartheid was worse than the genocide\u2019 \u2013 and about who\nhad the right to negotiate with the German government over its acknowledgment\nof responsibility.\n\nIn 2015, after years of struggle by Namibian and German civil society groups,\nthe German government agreed to acknowledge that genocide had been committed\nbetween 1904 and 1908. This paved the way for bilateral negotiations.\nGermany\u2019s position was that it could only negotiate with another government\nand that the Namibian government should choose its own representatives. While\nthe delegation Namibia sent included Nama and Ovaherero individuals,\nrepresentatives of their elected and traditional authorities did not take\npart. In May 2021 an agreement was reached between the two countries.\nAccording to the joint declaration, Germany said it was ready to recognise its\n\u2018moral responsibility for the colonisation of Namibia\u2019 and to apologise \u2018for\nthe historic developments that led to genocidal conditions between 1904 and\n1908\u2019. The Namibian government announced that it and its \u2018people accept\nGermany\u2019s apology\u2019. But they hadn\u2019t asked the affected communities.\n\nLast year, a number of UN special rapporteurs sent a letter to both\ngovernments making clear that according to the UN Declaration on the Rights of\nIndigenous Peoples, signed by Germany and Namibia in 2007, \u2018Indigenous peoples\nhave the right to participate in decision-making in matters which would affect\ntheir rights, through representatives chosen by themselves.\u2019 The OTA and NTLA\nposition is encapsulated in a slogan: \u2018Anything about us, without us, is\nagainst us.\u2019 Germany\u2019s acknowledgment of genocide amounted to less than the\naffected communities had hoped for. Germany understood its admission to be\nmorally rather than legally binding; the events of 1904 to 1908 could be\ndescribed as genocide, but only if considered from today\u2019s perspective. It was\nrelying on a legal formality, long challenged in cases of genocide and\nslavery: the \u2018intertemporal principle\u2019 holds that a legal question must be\nassessed on the basis of the laws in effect at the time the act was committed.\nGermany argued that since the UN Convention on Genocide only came into force\nin 1948 it couldn\u2019t be applied to the genocide in South-West Africa. A similar\nargument was presented by Eichmann at his trial in Jerusalem: since Hitler\u2019s\norders possessed \u2018the force of law\u2019 in the Third Reich, Eichmann was acting\naccording to the laws of the time. The mass killing of civilians in the\ncontext of war was already illegal under the terms of The Hague Convention of\n1899 when both genocides were perpetrated; but since international law\nreferred to wars between \u2018civilised peoples\u2019 this was taken to exclude\ncolonial violence against Indigenous populations. Germany argued that crimes\ncommitted in South-West Africa should be assessed not in line with modern\nlegal standards but in accordance with the racist laws of the colonial era.\nThis prompted Sima Luipert of the NTLA to retort that Germany was effectively\nsaying that the Nama and Ovaherero were exterminated as \u2018uncivilised savages\u2019.\n\nGermany\u2019s admission of genocide in the historical rather than the legal sense\nalso meant it denied it had any obligation to pay reparations or facilitate\nrestitution. Accepting legal responsibility would have set a precedent that\ncould be used by other colonial peoples that had experienced genocide at the\nhands of European states including France and Britain. Germany announced that\nit would pay \u20ac1.1 billion over thirty years in development aid. Before\ncolonisation, the Ovaherero and Nama had been rich in land, cattle and\nculture. Luipert puts it like this: \u2018Development is the greatest Northern lie,\nthe presumed generosity of a civilisation founded on our oppression.\u2019 The\naffected communities insisted that Germany purchase some of their ancestral\nlands from the descendants of German settlers and return them. Almost three\nyears after its publication, as a result of objections from Namibian civil\nsociety groups and opposition parties, the joint declaration has not been\nratified by either the German or the Namibian parliament.\n\nThe OTA and the NTLA often make historical connections between the genocide\nthey suffered and the Holocaust. \u2018We always felt empathy and affinity with the\nJewish people as survivors of a German genocide, and were inspired by their\nquest for reparation,\u2019 their statement reads. \u2018This is not only because we too\nexperienced genocide, but because the Jewish Holocaust is directly linked to\nwhat happened at Shark Island and other German-established extermination camps\non our lands.\u2019\n\nThere are clear continuities between the two German genocides. Many of the key\nelements of the Nazi system \u2013 the systematic extermination of peoples seen as\nracially inferior, racial laws, the concept of Lebensraum, the transportation\nof people in cattle trucks for forced labour in concentration camps \u2013 had been\nemployed half a century earlier in South-West Africa. Heinrich G\u00f6ring, the\ncolonial governor of South-West Africa who tried to negotiate with Hendrik\nWitbooi, was Hermann G\u00f6ring\u2019s father.\n\nThe claim that there is a relationship between colonialism and National\nSocialism may still be controversial in German academic and political circles,\nas well as in the media, but it is certainly not new. In The Origins of\nTotalitarianism (1951), Hannah Arendt argued that \u2018European imperialism played\na crucial role in the development of Nazi totalitarianism and associated\ngenocides.\u2019 The \u2018boomerang effect\u2019, as defined by Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire, identified\nEuropean fascism as the homecoming of colonial violence. In 1947, W.E.B. Du\nBois wrote that \u2018there was no Nazi atrocity \u2013 concentration camps, wholesale\nmaiming and murder, defilement of women, or ghastly blasphemy of childhood \u2013\nwhich the Christian civilisation of Europe had not long been practising\nagainst coloured folks in all parts of the world.\u2019 These connections have been\ndiscussed more recently by David Olusoga and Casper W. Erichsen in The\nKaiser\u2019s Holocaust (2010), and by Juergen Zimmerer in From Windhoek to\nAuschwitz? (2019). The links between the genocide in South-West Africa and the\nHolocaust depend on something else that Zimmerer makes clear: the colonial\ndimension of the Nazi exterminatory war in Eastern Europe. As Timothy Snyder\nput it, colonial ambitions transformed the \u2018black earth\u2019 of the Ukrainian\nsteppe into \u2018bloodlands\u2019 of ethnic conquest, enslavement and genocide. After\nimperial Germany lost its colonial empire in the First World War, the Nazis\nplanned to attain Lebensraum by colonising the fertile, food-producing regions\nin Ukraine, where the majority of Eastern European Jews lived. Germany\u2019s\ncolonial policies may have been factors in the near total destruction of Jews\nand the enslavement of Slavic peoples in Eastern Europe, but the imperial-\ncolonial dimension can\u2019t explain every aspect of the Holocaust, which has\nideological roots in a European antisemitism that long predates colonialism.\n\nThe connection between the Namibian genocide and the Holocaust isn\u2019t only\nacademic. In 2017, plaintiffs representing Nama and Ovaherero organisations\nbrought a class-action lawsuit against Germany in New York City, claiming that\nsome of the wealth derived from slave labour and the expropriation of property\nin former South-West Africa had been invested there. They demanded the same\nlegal redress and reparations that Jewish Holocaust survivors had received.\nTwo years later the judge announced that the case had no legal standing, and\nit was dismissed.\n\nI have visited Namibia several times over the past few years with teams from\nForensic Architecture and its Berlin-based sister group, Forensis. We were\nasked by the OTA, the NTLA and the Ovaherero/Ovambanderu Genocide Foundation\nto collaborate with traditional oral historians to locate and map ancestral\nvillages destroyed during the genocide, along with concentration camps and\nmass graves, and to help construct evidence files to be presented in support\nof cases demanding their preservation, along with reparations and land\nrestitution. In December, together with the OTA and the NTLA, we presented our\nfindings in a cultural centre in Berlin and at the Bundestag\u2019s Committee on\nHuman Rights.\n\nSome of the sites we identified are found in farmland owned by descendants of\nthe Schutztruppe. The farms around the Waterberg have in recent decades been\nturned into game reserves where tourists pay to hunt. On occasion, affected\ncommunities have been refused access on memorial days, on the grounds that\nthey would disturb the wildlife. This is a historical irony: Indigenous people\nwere dispossessed because under the legal principle of terra nullius, which\nwas used to facilitate the transfer of lands from Indigenous people to\nsettlers in the colonial era, they were considered \u2018part of the natural\nenvironment\u2019.\n\nThere are countless monuments across Namibia to German perpetrators of\ngenocide. But a lack of government funding and structural neglect has allowed\nsites important to the affected communities to fall into ruin. In Swakopmund,\nlocal residents have taken it on themselves to maintain a cemetery where\ngenocide victims are buried in face of mainly white residents who use it as a\nfield on which to test all-terrain vehicles. Other historical sites are\nunknown and unmarked. Namibia\u2019s economy depends on European tourism, and\ncommemorating a European genocide makes visitors uncomfortable. In the tourist\ncamp at the Waterberg National Park, a restaurant serving German dishes \u2013\n\u2018game Schnitzel\u2019 was on the menu when I went \u2013 occupies a colonial-era police\nstation. A photograph of the Kaiser looms over the diners. The wine is sent up\nfrom a cellar that was used as a prison during the genocide. The only cemetery\nin the area \u2013 well-tended and much visited \u2013 contains the remains of the\nGerman soldiers killed when attacking the Ovaherero in Waterberg. Few visitors\nto this breathtaking landscape realise that the cemetery stands on the ruins\nof the Kambazembi homesteads destroyed in August 1904. This fact, known to\noral historians, was confirmed by a single old photograph of the village that\nwe found in the Colonial Photography Archive in Frankfurt. A distinctive rock\nformation in the mountain range in the background of the picture settled the\nmatter.\n\nIn a recent visit to the farm still called Hornkranz \u2013 you have to make\nprivate arrangements to gain access \u2013 we saw two apartheid-era signs\nmisrepresenting the genocide as a \u2018battle\u2019 and using a derogatory term to\ndescribe the Nama. Walking across the rocks that surround the farmstead we\nfound 19th-century bullet cartridges testifying to the location of the\nskirmishes that preceded the massacre. The dry environment had preserved other\ntraces, such as the footprints of homes made from wood and straw, allowing us\nto map the extent of the settlement.\n\nOn the site of the extermination camp at Shark Island, the Namibian government\nhas poured gravel to enable cars to drive in between the rocks, and erected\ntables and benches for tourists who want to camp and barbecue there. Instead\nof a \u2018place of contemplation, a place of remembrance and a place which warns\nthat such acts of genocide should never happen,\u2019 Johannes Isaack, the Nama\nchief and chairperson of the NTLA, said, \u2018after 33 years of independence Shark\nIsland continues to be a tourist destination where visitors may ... wine and\ndine on the bones of the heroes and heroines who started the earliest\nresistance against colonial occupation.\u2019\n\nI am currently in Namibia for the anniversary on 12 April of the beginning of\ngenocide in Hornkranz and to support the communities\u2019 legal attempts to stop\nthe imminent expansion of the port of L\u00fcderitz over the site. The irony is\nthat the planned expansion is part of a major \u2018green energy\u2019 project supported\nby both the Namibian and German governments. The unusually strong winds that\nbrought colonisation to these shores and froze to death some of the prisoners\non Shark Island will now power hundreds of turbines to produce liquid hydrogen\n\u2013 fuel that will be transported to Europe from a dock on Shark Island.\n\nThere are \u2018worrying similarities between what was played out in South-West\nAfrica and what is being played out today in Gaza\u2019, as Didier Fassin wrote a\nfew weeks after 7 October. In both cases, the mass killing, destruction and\ndisplacements followed humiliating military defeats by people they thought to\nbe inferior. The Nama and Ovaherero traditional authorities insist on the\nrecognition of these historical continuities: \u2018Our shared experience of\nsettler colonialism and apartheid becomes a platform from which we do not\nclaim for singularity but rather pursue global justice and a quest for\nsolidarity and universal freedom.\u2019 It is important to listen to these voices.\nSuch continuities could bring together the history of the Holocaust with that\nof colonialism and enslavement, allowing the historical solidarity between\nBlacks and Jews, and between anti-Zionist Jews and Palestinians, to be\nrecognised.\n\nIsrael and Germany\u2019s insistence on the singularity and uniqueness of the\nHolocaust opens a gap between the histories of antisemitism and racism to such\na degree that these two forms of political power fuelled by hatred are pitted\nagainst each other. In this context it\u2019s inspiring that the Nama and Ovaherero\ngroups decided to respond to the political atmosphere of censorship and\nintimidation that greets any expression of support for Palestinians \u2013\nsomething they experienced when they visited Berlin in December. \u2018It is also\nwith concern that we note attacks against voices from activists from\nPalestine, the Global South, the Muslim world, as well as dissident Jewish\nartists and scholars speaking out against [Israeli] policies. We stand with\nthem because we know what it means to speak truth to repressive powers, and\nwhat are the consequences of such acts.\u2019\n\n12 April\n\nShare on TwitterShare on FacebookEmailPrintLetters\n\nSend Letters To:\n\nThe Editor London Review of Books, 28 Little Russell Street London, WC1A 2HN\n\nletters@lrb.co.uk\n\nPlease include name, address, and a telephone number.\n\n### Eyal Weizman\n\nEyal Weizman is founder of Forensic Architecture.
