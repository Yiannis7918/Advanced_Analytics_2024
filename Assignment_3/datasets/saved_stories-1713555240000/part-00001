Flickr\n\nWhen Fred Boyce and dozens of other boys joined the Science Club at Fernald\nState School in 1949, it was more about the perks than the science. Club\nmembers scored tickets to Boston Red Sox games, trips off the school grounds,\ngifts like Mickey Mouse watches and lots of free breakfasts. But Fernald\nwasn\u2019t an ordinary school, and the free breakfasts from the Science Club\nweren\u2019t your average bowl of cereal: the boys were being fed Quaker oatmeal\nlaced with radioactive tracers.\n\nThe Fernald State School, originally called The Massachusetts School for the\nFeeble-Minded, housed mentally disabled children along with those who had been\nabandoned by their parents. Conditions at the school were often brutal; staff\ndeprived boys of meals, forced them to do manual labor and abused them. Boyce,\nwho lived there after being abandoned by his family, was eager to join the\nScience Club. He hoped the scientists, in their positions of authority, might\nsee the mistreatment and put an end to it.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know anything at the time,\u201d Boyce said of the experiments. \u201cWe just\nthought we were special.\u201d Learning the truth about the club felt like a deep\nbetrayal.\n\nThe boys didn't find out the whole story about their contaminated cereal for\nanother four decades. During a stretch between the late 1940s and early 1950s,\nRobert Harris, a professor of nutrition at the Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology, led three different experiments involving 74 Fernald boys, aged 10\nto 17. As part of the study, the boys were fed oatmeal and milk laced with\nradioactive iron and calcium; in another experiment, scientists directly\ninjected the boys with radioactive calcium.\n\n1 / 3\n\nFernald State School, where the boys lived when they were part of MIT's\nScience Club.

Wikimedia Commons\n\n3 / 3\n\nQuaker Oats funded the radiation studies for commercial reasons.\n\nThe Fernald students\u2019 experiment was just one among dozens of radiation\nexperiments approved by the Atomic Energy Commission. Between 1945 and 1962,\nmore than 210,000 civilians and GIs were exposed to radiation, often without\nknowing it. What seems unthinkable in today's era of ethics review boards and\ninformed consent was standard procedure at the dawning of the Atomic Age.\n\nJohn Lantos, a pediatrician at University of Missouri-Kansas City School of\nMedicine and expert in medical ethics, says the experiments were indicative of\nAmerica's post-war mindset. \u201cTechnology was good, we were the leaders, we were\nthe good guys, so anything we did could not be bad,\u201d he says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until\nthe '70s, after the Tuskegee study, that Congress passed federal regulation\nrequiring a specific kind of oversight.\u201d\n\nThe Tuskegee study is the benchmark example of medical abuse and involved\nhundreds of African-American men with syphilis who were promised treatment but\nnever received it. In another case reminiscent of the one at Fernald, students\nat Willowbrook State School (also considered mentally handicapped) were\npurposely exposed to the Hepatitis A virus so that researchers could develop a\nvaccine.\n\nHow did a seemingly innocuous breakfast food get tied up with Atomic Age\nresearch? At the time, scientists were eager to conduct experiments concerning\nhuman health, and the booming breakfast cereal industry meant there was big\nmoney to be made or lost. As a result, brands like Quaker wanted science on\ntheir side. They'd been locked in competition with another hot breakfast\ncereal\u2014Cream of Wheat, made with farina\u2014since the early 1900s. And both of the\nhot cereal companies had to contend with the rise of sugary dry cereals,\nserved with cold milk and a heaping portion of advertising.\n\nTo make matters worse for Quaker, a series of studies suggested high levels of\nphytate (a naturally occurring cyclic acid) in plant-based grains\u2014like\noats\u2014might inhibit absorption of iron, whereas farina (Cream of Wheat) didn\u2019t\nseem to have the same effect. The market for cereal products was booming\u2014in\nthe post-WWII years, Quaker\u2019s sales grew to $277 million. Nutrition was high\nin the minds of buyers of the era, especially since the Department of\nAgriculture produced its first dietary guidelines in 1943, including oatmeal\nas an ideal whole grain. Television advertisements from the 1950s highlighted\nQuaker Oats\u2019 nutritional content as a selling point.\n\nQuaker Oats Commercial\n\nWatch on\n\nIn a bid to refute the research that unfavorably compared Quaker with Cream of\nWheat, Quaker decided to do experiments of its own. So Quaker supplied the\ncereal, MIT received funding for their research, and the school, presumably,\nprovided free breakfast and entertainment for its students.\n\nIn the three experiments, the boys at Fernald ate oats coated with radioactive\niron tracers, milk with radioactive calcium tracers (radioactive atoms whose\ndecay is measured to understand chemical reactions happening in the body), and\nwere given injections of radioactive calcium. The first two experiments'\nresults were encouraging to Quaker: Oatmeal was no worse than farina when it\ncame to inhibiting absorption of iron and calcium into the bloodstream. The\nthird experiment showed that calcium entering the bloodstream goes straight to\nthe bones, which would prove important in later studies of osteoporosis.\n\nThe details of the experiments came out in 1993, when Secretary of Energy\nHazel O\u2019Leary declassified a number of Atomic Energy Commission documents,\nspurred in part by Eileen Welsome\u2019s investigative reporting on other radiation\ntesting by the U.S. government, and intensified concern over the nuclear\nweapons industry. Then came a report in the Boston Globe. Soon other\npublications were urging victims to come forward.\n\nA 1995 lawsuit pinpointed the purpose of these experiments: Quaker\u2019s\ncommercial interests. \u201cWhat was the genesis of these particular experiments?\nIt seems simply to be what are the relative benefits of oatmeal and Cream of\nWheat,\u201d prosecuting attorney Michael Mattchen told the Associated Press.\n\nA hearing before the Senate\u2019s Committee on Labor and Human Resources was\ncalled in January 1994 to investigate the Fernald experiments. During the\nsession, Senator Edward Kennedy, the committee chair, asked why researchers\nhadn\u2019t conducted the experiment on MIT students or children at private\nschools. \u201cAren\u2019t you appalled at the fact that the most vulnerable people in\nour society, which are young people, 7, 8 years old, that are in an\ninstitution, aren\u2019t you appalled that they were the ones selected?\u201d he asked.\n\nAt the Senate hearing, David Litster of MIT said the experiment involving\noatmeal only exposed the boys to 170 to 330 millirems of radiation, roughly\nthe equivalent of receiving 30 consecutive chest x-rays.\n\n\u201cAs to what are the medical and biological effects of that, with such low\ndoses of radiation, it\u2019s very difficult,\u201d Litster said. A child exposed to\nthat kind of dose, he said, would have a one in 2,000 chance of contracting\ncancer, which was barely higher than the average rate. A 1994 Massachusetts\nstate panel concluded none of the students suffered significant health\nimpacts, and radioactive tracers continue to be used in medicine.\n\nBut the real issues weren\u2019t simply a matter of future health risk: the boys,\nwho were especially vulnerable without parents and guardians looking out for\ntheir best interests in the state school, were used for experiments without\ntheir consent.\n\nWhen the case went to court, 30 former Fernald students filed suit against MIT\nand Quaker Oats. In 1995, President Clinton apologized to the Fernald\nstudents, since the Atomic Energy Commission had indirectly sponsored the\nstudy with a contract to the radioactivity center at MIT. A settlement for\n$1.85 million was reached in January 1998. Even before this particular case,\nregulations like the National Research Act of 1974 had been enacted to protect\nAmericans from unethical experiments.\n\nAt the end of the three experiments the boys at Fernald unwittingly\nparticipated in, scientists did have some important new findings\u2014though they\nhad nothing to do with cereal. After injecting nine young boys with\nradioactive calcium, researchers were able to determine what happens to\ncalcium after it enters the bloodstream (it quickly goes to the bones) and how\nit is excreted (mostly through urine). This research on calcium metabolism\nprovided the groundwork for later research on osteoporosis, according to\nLitster.\n\nBut for Boyce, the pain of abuse lingers. \u201cIt\u2019s a funny type of animosity.\nIt\u2019s a disappointing type of feeling,\u201d he said of the researchers who had the\nopportunity to help, but instead took advantage of students in need.\n\nGet the latest History stories in your inbox?\n\nLorraine Boissoneault | | READ MORE\n\nLorraine Boissoneault is a contributing writer to SmithsonianMag.com covering\nhistory and archaeology.
