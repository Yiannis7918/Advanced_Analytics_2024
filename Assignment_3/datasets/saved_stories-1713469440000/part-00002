Persistent\nactivity of the sympathetic nervous system is required to maintain\nhomeostasis, as it modulates processes such as cardiac output, blood glucose\nmonitoring, and digestion. The system is also best known for mediating the\nfight-or-flight response in vertebrates.\n\nLamprey, or Petromyzon marinus, are the closest thing we have today to\nstudying the ancient fish ancestors from which we evolved 550 million years\nago. Researchers in the laboratory of Marianne Bronner, Edward B. Lewis\nProfessor of Biology and director of the Beckman Institute, use lamprey to\nstudy how developmental changes may have promoted progressive evolution of\nvertebrate traits. Now, new research from Bronner's lab finds sympathetic\nneurons in lamprey, revising the timeline of sympathetic nervous system\nevolution.\n\n\"Over a hundred years of literature has suggested that lamprey lack a\nsympathetic nervous system,\" says Bronner. \"Surprisingly, we found that\nsympathetic neurons do, in fact, exist in lamprey but arise at a much later\ntime in lamprey development than expected.\"\n\nThe research was led by postdoctoral scholar Brittany Edens and is described\nin a paper appearing on April 17 in the journal Nature.\n\nBronner's laboratory studies neural crest cells, a kind of stem cell specific\nto vertebrates that gives rise to various cell types throughout the body.\nUntil this study, it was thought that lamprey lacked the neural crest-derived\nprecursors, or progenitors, that ultimately comprise the sympathetic nervous\nsystem.\n\nThat's because, Bronner says, researchers previously looked for evidence of\nsympathetic nervous system too early in lamprey development. In birds, for\nexample, the sympathetic nervous system forms in the first two or three days\nof development, and many other vertebrates develop these cells early in\ngestation. But in lamprey, Edens and her team discovered that the neural\ncrest\u2013derived progenitor cells (those that will ultimately give rise to\nsympathetic neurons) only first appear as long as a month post-fertilization\nand do not fully mature into neurons until around four months, during the\nlarval stage.\n\nWhile it remains unknown whether the sympathetic nervous system of lamprey\nmediates fight-or-flight-like behaviors similar to those observed in other\nvertebrates, these findings suggest that the developmental program governing\nformation of sympathetic neurons is evolutionarily conserved across all\nvertebrates, from lamprey to mammals.\n\nThe paper is titled \"Neural crest origin of sympathetic neurons at the dawn of\nvertebrates.\" In addition to Edens and Bronner, co-authors are postdoctoral\nscholar Jan Stundl and graduate student Hugo Urrutia.
