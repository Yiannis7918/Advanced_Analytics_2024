It is bordered by\nthe Indian Ocean to the south and the Java Sea to the north. With a population\nof 151.6 million people, Java is the world's most populous island, home to\napproximately 56% of the Indonesian population.^[3] Indonesia's capital city,\nJakarta, is on Java's northwestern coast.\n\nMany of the best known events in Indonesian history took place on Java. It was\nthe centre of powerful Hindu-Buddhist empires, the Islamic sultanates, and the\ncore of the colonial Dutch East Indies. Java was also the center of the\nIndonesian struggle for independence during the 1930s and 1940s. Java\ndominates Indonesia politically, economically and culturally. Four of\nIndonesia's eight UNESCO world heritage sites are located in Java: Ujung Kulon\nNational Park, Borobudur Temple, Prambanan Temple, and Sangiran Early Man\nSite.\n\nJava was formed by volcanic eruptions due to geologic subduction of the\nAustralian Plate under the Sunda Plate. It is the 13th largest island in the\nworld and the fifth largest in Indonesia by landmass, at about 138,800 square\nkilometres (53,600 sq mi). A chain of volcanic mountains is the east\u2013west\nspine of the island.\n\nFour main languages are spoken on the island: Javanese, Sundanese, Madurese,\nand Betawi. Javanese and Sundanese are the most spoken.^[4] The ethnic groups\nnative to the island are the Javanese in the central and eastern parts and\nSundanese in the western parts. The Madurese in the Eastern salient of Java\nare migrants from Madura Island, while the Betawi in the capital city of\nJakarta are hybrids from various ethnic groups in Indonesia. Most residents\nare bilingual, speaking Indonesian (the official language of Indonesia) as\ntheir first or second language. While the majority of the people of Java are\nMuslim, Java's population comprises people of diverse religious beliefs,\nethnicities, and cultures.^[5]\n\nJava is divided into four administrative provinces: Banten, West Java, Central\nJava, and East Java, and two special regions, Jakarta and Yogyakarta.\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\nSee also: Zabag kingdom and Al-Wakwak\n\nThe origins of the name \"Java\" are not clear. The island could possibly have\nbeen named after the j\u00e1wa-wut plant, which was said to be common in the island\nduring the time, and that prior to Indianization the island had different\nnames.^[6] There are other possible sources: the word ja\u00fa and its variations\nmean \"beyond\" or \"distant\".^[7] And, in Sanskrit yava means barley, a plant\nfor which the island was famous.^[7] \"Yavadvipa\" is mentioned in India's\nearliest epic, the Ramayana. Sugriva, the chief of Rama's army, dispatched his\nmen to Yavadvipa, the island of Java, in search of Sita.^[8] It was hence\nreferred to in India by the Sanskrit name \"y\u0101vaka dv\u012bpa\" (dv\u012bpa = island).\nJava is mentioned in the ancient Tamil text Manimekalai by Chithalai Chathanar\nwhich states that Java had a kingdom with a capital called\nNagapuram.^[9]^[10]^[11] Another source states that the word \"Java\" is derived\nfrom a Proto-Austronesian root word, meaning \"home\".^[12] The great island of\nIabadiu or Jabadiu was mentioned in Ptolemy's Geographia composed around 150\nCE in the Roman Empire. Iabadiu is said to mean \"barley island\", to be rich in\ngold, and have a silver town called Argyra at the west end. The name indicates\nJava^[13] and seems to be derived from the Sanskrit name Java-dvipa\n(Yavadvipa).\n\nThe annual news of Songshu and Liangshu (5th century CE) referred to Java as\n\u95cd\u5a46 (She-p\u00f3 or She-b\u00f3), He-ling (640\u2013818), then called it She-po again until\nthe Yuan dynasty (1271\u20131368), where they began mentioning \u722a\u54c7 (Zhao-Wa or Chao-\nWa).^[14] According to Ma Huan's book (the Yingya Shenlan), the Chinese called\nJava Chao-Wa, and the island was called She-po in the past.^[15] Sulaiman al-\nTajir al-Sirafi mentioned two notable islands which separated Arabia and\nChina: One is the 800 farsakh long Al-Rami, which is identified as Sumatra,\nand the other is Zabaj (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0627\u0628\u062c, Indonesian: Sabak), 400 farsakh in\nlength, identified as Java.^[16]^: 30\u201331 When John of Marignolli returned from\nChina to Avignon, he stayed at the Kingdom of Saba for a few months, which he\nsaid had many elephants and was led by a queen; Saba may be his interpretation\nof She-b\u00f3.^[17]^: xii, 192\u2013194 Afanasij Nikitin, a merchant from Tver (in\nRussia), traveled to India in 1466 and described the land of java, which he\ncalled \u0448\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 (shabait/\u0161abajte).^[18]^[19]\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\nSee also: Volcanoes of Java\n\nMount Bromo in East Java\n\nJava lies between Sumatra to the west and Bali to the east. Borneo lies to the\nnorth, and Christmas Island is to the south. It is the world's 13th largest\nisland. Java is surrounded by the Java Sea to the north, the Sunda Strait to\nthe west, the Indian Ocean to the south and Bali Strait and Madura Strait in\nthe east.^[citation needed]\n\nJava is almost entirely of volcanic origin; it contains thirty-eight mountains\nforming an east\u2013west spine that have at one time or another been active\nvolcanoes. The highest volcano in Java is Mount Semeru, 3,676 metres (12,060\nft). The most active volcano in Java and also in Indonesia is Mount Merapi,\n2,930 metres (9,610 ft). In total, Java has more than 150 mountains.^[citation\nneeded]\n\nJava's mountains and highlands split the interior into a series of relatively\nisolated regions suitable for wet-rice cultivation; the rice lands of Java are\namong the richest in the world.^[20] Java was the first place where Indonesian\ncoffee was grown, starting in 1699. Today, coffea arabica is grown on the Ijen\nPlateau by small-holders and larger plantations.^[citation needed]\n\nParahyangan highland near Buitenzorg, c. 1865\u20131872\n\nThe area of Java is about 150,000 square kilometres (58,000 sq mi).^[20] It is\nabout 1,000 km (620 mi) long and up to 210 km (130 mi) wide. The island's\nlongest river is the 600 km long Solo River.^[21] The river rises from its\nsource in central Java at the Lawu volcano, then flows north and eastward to\nits mouth in the Java Sea near the city of Surabaya. Other major rivers are\nBrantas, Citarum, Cimanuk and Serayu.^[citation needed]\n\nThe average temperature ranges from 22 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F) to 29 \u00b0C (84 \u00b0F); average\nhumidity is 75%. The northern coastal plains are normally hotter, averaging 34\n\u00b0C (93 \u00b0F) during the day in the dry season. The south coast is generally\ncooler than the north, and highland areas inland are even cooler.^[22] The wet\nseason begins in November and ends in April. During that rain falls mostly in\nthe afternoons and intermittently during other parts of the year. The wettest\nmonths are January and February.^[citation needed]\n\nWest Java is wetter than East Java, and mountainous regions receive much\nhigher rainfall. The Parahyangan highlands of West Java receive over 4,000\nmillimetres (160 in) annually, while the north coast of East Java receives 900\nmillimetres (35 in) annually.^[citation needed]\n\n## Natural environment[edit]\n\nCymbidium dayanum - typical orchid in Java.\n\nJava is an island with a large amount of biodiversity. The natural environment\nof Java is tropical rainforest, with ecosystems ranging from coastal mangrove\nforest on the north coast, rocky coastal cliffs on the southern coast, and\nlow-lying tropical forest to high altitude rainforest on the slopes of\nmountainous volcanic regions in the interior. The Javan environment and\nclimate gradually alters from west to east; from wet and humid dense\nrainforest in western parts, to a dry savanna environment in the east,\ncorresponding to the climate and rainfall in these regions.^[citation needed]\n\nMale Javan rhino shot in 1934 in West Java. Today only small numbers of Javan\nrhino survive in Ujung Kulon; it is the world's rarest rhino.\n\nJavan wildlife originally supported a rich biodiversity, where numbers of\nendemic species of flora and fauna flourished; such as the Javan\nrhinoceros,^[23] Javan banteng, Javan warty pig, Javan hawk-eagle, Javan\npeafowl, Javan silvery gibbon, Javan lutung, Java mouse-deer, Javan rusa, and\nJavan leopard. With over 450 bird species and 37 endemic species, Java is a\nbirdwatcher's paradise.^[24] There are about 130 freshwater fish species in\nJava.^[25] There are also several endemic amphibian species in Java, including\n5 species of tree frogs.^[citation needed]\n\nSince ancient times, people have opened the rainforest, altered the ecosystem,\nshaped the landscapes and created rice paddy and terraces to support the\ngrowing population. Javan rice terraces have existed for more than a\nmillennium and had supported ancient agricultural kingdoms. The growing human\npopulation has put severe pressure on Java's wildlife, as rainforests were\ndiminished and confined to highland slopes or isolated peninsulas. Some of\nJava's endemic species are now critically endangered, with some already\nextinct; Java used to have Javan tigers and Javan elephants, but both have\nbeen rendered extinct. Today, several national parks exist in Java that\nprotect the remnants of its fragile wildlife, such as Ujung Kulon, Mount\nHalimun-Salak, Gede Pangrango, Baluran, Meru Betiri, Bromo Tengger Semeru and\nAlas Purwo.\n\n## History[edit]\n\nMount Sumbing surrounded by rice fields. Java's volcanic topography and rich\nagricultural lands are the fundamental factors in its history.\n\nFossilised remains of Homo erectus, popularly known as the \"Java Man\", dating\nback 1.3 million^[26] years were found along the banks of the Bengawan Solo\nRiver.^[27]\n\nThe island's exceptional fertility and rainfall allowed the development of\nwet-field rice cultivation, which required sophisticated levels of cooperation\nbetween villages. Out of these village alliances, small kingdoms developed.\nThe chain of volcanic mountains and associated highlands running the length of\nJava kept its interior regions and peoples separate and relatively\nisolated.^[28] Before the advent of Islamic states and European colonialism,\nthe rivers provided the main means of communication, although Java's many\nrivers are mostly short. Only the Brantas river and Solo river could provide\nlong-distance communication and this way their valleys supported the centers\nof major kingdoms. A system of roads, permanent bridges, and toll gates is\nthought to have been established in Java by at least the mid-17th century.\nLocal powers could disrupt the routes as could the wet season and road use was\nhighly dependent on constant maintenance. Consequently, communication between\nJava's population was difficult.^[20]\n\nStanding warrior bronze figures, Java, c. 500 BC \u2013 300 AD\n\nThe emergence of civilization on the island of Java is often associated with\nthe arrival of Aji Saka in 78 AD. Although Aji Saka is said to be the bearer\nof civilization on Java, the story received several objections and rebuttals\nfrom other historical sources. Valmiki's Ramayana, made around 500 BC, records\nthat Java already had a governmental organization long before the story:\n\n> \"Yawadwipa is decorated with seven kingdoms, gold and silver islands, rich\n> in gold mines, and there is Cicira (cold) Mountain that touches the sky with\n> its peak.\"^[29]^: 6\n\nThe Greek geographer Ptolemy called the island Yabadiou or Sabadiou (Ancient\nGreek: \u0399\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03b4\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 or \u03a3\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03b4\u03af\u03bf\u03c5).^[30]^[31]\n\nAccording to Chinese record M\u00edng Sh\u01d0, the Javanese kingdom was founded in 65\nBC, or 143 years before the story of Aji Saka began.^[32]^: 39\n\nThe story of Aji Saka is a Neo Javanese story. This story has not yet been\nfound to be relevant in the Old Javanese text. This story tells of events in\nthe Medang Kamulan kingdom in Java in the past. At that time, the king of\nMedang Kamulan Prabu Dewata Cengkar was replaced by Aji Saka. This story is\nconsidered as an allegory of the entry of Indians into Java. Referring to the\nLiang dynasty information, the Javanese kingdom was divided into two: the pre-\nHinduism kingdom and the post-Hindu kingdom, which began in 78 AD.^[16]^: 5\nand 7\n\n### Hindu\u2013Buddhist kingdoms era[edit]\n\nSee also: History of Southeast Asia \u00a7 Early historical era\n\nThe 9th century Borobudur Buddhist stupa in Central Java\n\nThe Taruma and Sunda kingdoms of western Java appeared in the 4th and 7th\ncenturies respectively, while the Kalingga Kingdom sent embassies to China\nstarting in 640.^[33]^: 53, 79 However, the first major principality was the\nMataram Kingdom that was founded in central Java at the beginning of the 8th\ncentury. Mataram's religion centered on the Hindu god Shiva, and the kingdom\nproduced some of Java's earliest Hindu temples on the Dieng Plateau. Around\nthe 8th century, the Sailendra dynasty rose in Kedu Plain and become the\npatron of Mahayana Buddhism. This ancient kingdom built monuments such as the\n9th century Borobudur and Prambanan in central Java.^[citation needed]\n\nAround the 10th century, the center of power shifted from central to eastern\nJava. The eastern Javanese kingdoms of Kediri, Singhasari and Majapahit were\nmainly dependent on rice agriculture, yet also pursued trade within the\nIndonesian archipelago, and with China and India. Majapahit was established by\nWijaya,^[33]^: 201 and by the end of the reign of Hayam Wuruk (r. 1350\u201389) it\nclaimed sovereignty over the entire Indonesian archipelago, although control\nwas likely limited to Java, Bali, and Madura. Hayam Wuruk's prime minister,\nGajah Mada, led many of the kingdom's territorial conquests.^[33]^: 234\nPrevious Javanese kingdoms had their power based on agriculture, however,\nMajapahit took control of ports and shipping lanes and became Java's first\ncommercial empire. With the death of Hayam Wuruk and the coming of Islam to\nIndonesia, Majapahit went into decline.^[33]^: 241\n\n### Spread of Islam and rise of Islamic sultanates[edit]\n\nSee also: Spread of Islam in Indonesia \u00a7 Central and eastern Java\n\nThis section does not cite any sources.

The principalities of Surabaya\nand Cirebon were eventually subjugated such that only Mataram and Banten were\nleft to face the Dutch in the 17th century.\n\n### Colonial periods[edit]\n\nTea plantation in Java during Dutch colonial period, in or before 1926\n\nJava's contact with the European colonial powers began in 1522 with a treaty\nbetween the Sunda kingdom and the Portuguese in Malacca. After its failure,\nthe Portuguese presence was confined to Malacca and to the eastern islands. In\n1596, a four-ship expedition led by Cornelis de Houtman was the first Dutch\ncontact with Indonesia.^[34] By the end of the 18th century the Dutch had\nextended their influence over the sultanates of the interior through the Dutch\nEast India Company in Indonesia. Internal conflict prevented the Javanese from\nforming effective alliances against the Dutch. Remnants of the Mataram\nsurvived as the Surakarta (Solo) and Yogyakarta principalities. Javanese kings\nclaimed to rule with divine authority and the Dutch helped them to preserve\nremnants of a Javanese aristocracy by confirming them as regents or district\nofficials within the colonial administration.\n\nJava's major role during the early part of the colonial period was as a\nproducer of rice. In spice-producing islands like Banda, rice was regularly\nimported from Java, to supply the deficiency in means of subsistence.^[35]\n\nBritish Occupation of Java; men of the Bengal Sappers and Miners burn houses\nin the village of Bekasi as a reprisal for the murder of five members of the\nRoyal Air Force and twenty Maharatta riflemen whose Dakota transport aircraft\ncrash-landed near the village.\n\nDuring the Napoleonic wars in Europe, the Netherlands fell to France, as did\nits colony in the East Indies. During the short-lived Daendels administration,\nas French proxy rule on Java, the construction of the Great Post Road was\ncommenced in 1808. The road, spanning from Anyer in Western Java to Panarukan\nin East Java, served as a military supply route and was used in defending Java\nfrom British invasion.^[36] In 1811, Java was captured by the British,\nbecoming a possession of the British Empire, and Sir Stamford Raffles was\nappointed as the island's governor. In 1816, under the governorship of John\nFendall, Java was returned to the Dutch as per the terms of the Treaty of\nParis.^[37]^[38]\n\nIn 1815, there may have been five million people in Java.^[39] In the second\nhalf of the 18th century, population spurts began in districts along the\nnorth-central coast of Java, and in the 19th century population grew rapidly\nacross the island. Factors for the great population growth include the impact\nof Dutch colonial rule including the imposed end to civil war in Java, the\nincrease in the area under rice cultivation, and the introduction of food\nplants such as cassava and maize that could sustain populations that could not\nafford rice.^[40] Others attribute the growth to the taxation burdens and\nincreased expansion of employment under the Cultivation System to which\ncouples responded by having more children in the hope of increasing their\nfamilies ability to pay tax and buy goods.^[41] Cholera claimed 100,000 lives\nin Java in 1820.^[42]\n\nJapanese prepare to discuss surrender terms with British-allied forces in\nJava, 1945.\n\nThe advent of trucks and railways where there had previously only been buffalo\nand carts, telegraph systems, and more coordinated distribution systems under\nthe colonial government all contributed to famine elimination in Java, and in\nturn, population growth. There were no significant famines in Java from the\n1840s through to the Japanese occupation in the 1940s.^[43] However, other\nsources claimed the Dutch's Cultivation system is linked to famines and\nepidemics in the 1840s, firstly in Cirebon and then Central Java, as cash\ncrops such as indigo and sugar had to be grown instead of rice.\n\n### Independence[edit]\n\nMain article: Indonesian National Awakening\n\nIndonesian nationalism first took hold in Java in the early 20th century, and\nthe struggle to secure the country's independence following World War II was\ncentered in Java. In 1949, Indonesian independence was recognized.\n\n## Administration[edit]\n\nSee also: Public administration of Java\n\nBantenWest JavaCentral JavaEast Java121 Jakarta2 Yogyakarta  \n---  \n  \nJava is divided into four provinces and two special regions:^[citation needed]\n\n  * Banten, capital: Serang\n  * Special Region of Jakarta\n  * West Java, capital: Bandung\n  * Central Java, capital: Semarang\n  * Special Region of Yogyakarta, capital: Yogyakarta\n  * East Java, capital: Surabaya, (which province also include Madura Island)\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n### Demographic profile[edit]\n\nJakarta, the capital of IndonesiaHistorical populationYear| Pop.| \u00b1%  \n---|---|---  \n1961| 63,059,575| \u2014  \n1971| 76,086,320| +20.7%  \n1980| 91,269,528| +20.0%  \n1990| 107,581,306| +17.9%  \n2000| 121,352,608| +12.8%  \n2010| 136,610,590| +12.6%  \n2015| 145,013,583| +6.2%  \n2020| 151,591,262| +4.5%  \n2022| 154,280,080| +1.8%  \nRefers to the administrative region (including Madura). Source:\n^[44]^[45]^[46]  \n  \nJava has been traditionally dominated by an elite class, while the people in\nthe lower classes were often involved in agriculture and fishing. The elite\nclass in Java has evolved over the course of history, as cultural wave after\ncultural wave immigrated to the island. There is evidence that South Asian\nemigres were among this elite, as well as Arabian and Persian immigrants\nduring the Islamic eras. More recently, Chinese immigrants have also become\npart of the economic elite of Java. Although politically the Chinese generally\nremain sidelined, there are notable exceptions, such as the former governor of\nJakarta, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama. Though Java is increasingly becoming more\nmodern and urban, only 75% of the island has electricity. Villages and their\nrice paddies are still a common sight. Unlike the rest of Java, the population\ngrowth in Central Java remains low. Central Java however has a younger\npopulation than the national average.^[47] The slow population growth can in\npart be attributed to the choice by many people to leave the more rural\nCentral Java for better opportunities and higher incomes in the bigger\ncities.^[48] Java's population continues to rapidly increase despite many\nJavanese leaving the island. This is somewhat due to the fact that Java is the\nbusiness, academic, and cultural hub of Indonesia, which attracts millions of\nnon-Javanese people to its cities. The population growth is most intense in\nthe regions surrounding Jakarta and Bandung, which is reflected through the\ndemographic diversity in those areas.^[citation needed]\n\n### Population development[edit]\n\nJava is the most populous major island in the world and is home to 56% of\nIndonesia's population, with a combined population of 151.6 million in the\n2020 census (including Madura's 4.0 million).^[49] At nearly 1,200 people per\nkm^2 in 2020, it is also one of the most densely populated parts of the world,\non a par with Bangladesh. Every region of the island has numerous volcanoes,\nwith the people left to share the remaining flatter land. Because of this,\nmany coasts are heavily populated and cities ring around the valleys\nsurrounding volcanic peaks.^[citation needed]\n\nThe population growth rate more than doubled in economically depressed Central\nJava in the latest 2010\u20132020 period vs 2000\u20132010, indicative of migration or\nother issues; there were significant volcanic eruptions during the earlier\nperiod. Approximately 45% of the population of Indonesia is ethnically\nJavanese,^[50] while Sundanese make a large portion of Java's population as\nwell.\n\nThe western third of the island (West Java, Banten, and DKI Jakarta) has an\neven higher population density, of roughly 1,563 per square kilometer and\naccounts for most of the population growth of Java.^[49] It is home to three\nmetropolitan areas, Greater Jakarta (with outlying areas of Greater Serang and\nGreater Sukabumi), Greater Bandung, and Greater Cirebon.^[citation needed]\n\nProvince or Special Region| Capital| Area km^2| Area %| Population census\n2000^[51]| Population census 2010^[52]| Population census 2020^[53]|\nPopulation estimate mid 2022^[54]| Population density mid 2021  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nBanten| Serang| 9,662.92| 7.1| 8,098,277| 10,632,166| 11,904,562| 12,250,000|\n1,248  \nSpecial Region of Jakarta| \u2013| 664.01| 0.5| 8,361,079| 9,607,787| 10,562,088|\n10,680,000| 15,978  \nWest Java| Bandung| 35,377.76| 27.1| 35,724,093| 43,053,732| 48,274,160|\n49,405,810| 1,379  \nWestern Java (3 areas above)| 45,704.69| 34.7| 52,183,449| 63,293,685|\n70,740,810| 72,335,810| 1,563  \nCentral Java| Semarang| 32,800.69| 25.3| 31,223,258| 32,382,657| 36,516,035|\n37,032,400| 1,120  \nYogyakarta Special Region| Yogyakarta| 3,133.15| 2.4| 3,121,045| 3,457,491|\n3,668,719| 3,761,900| 1,185  \nCentral Java Region (2 areas above)| 35,933.84| 27.7| 34,344,303| 35,840,148|\n40,184,754| 40,794,300| 1,126  \nEast Java| Surabaya| 47,799.75| 37.3| 34,765,993| 37,476,757| 40,665,696|\n41,149,970| 855  \nRegion Administered as Java| Jakarta| 129,438.28| 100%| 121,293,745|\n136,610,590| 151,591,260| 154,280,080| 1,180  \n  \n    Madura Island of East Java\n| \u2013| 5,025.30| 3.3| 3,230,300| 3,622,763| 4,004,564| 4,065,230| 802  \n  \n    Java Island^1)\n| \u2013| 124,412.98| 96.7| 118,063,445| 132,987,827| 147,586,696| 150,214,850|\n1,196  \n  \n^1) Other islands are included in this figure, but are very small in\npopulation and area, Nusa Barung 100 km^2, Bawean 196 km^2, Karimunjawa 78\nkm^2, Kambangan 121 km^2, Panaitan 170 km^2, and the Thousand Islands 8.7 km^2\n\u2013 with a combined population of roughly 90,000.\n\n^2) Land area of provinces updated in 2010 Census figures, areas by 2020 may\nbe different from past results.\n\nFrom the 1970s to the fall of the Suharto regime in 1998, the Indonesian\ngovernment ran transmigration programs aimed at resettling the population of\nJava on other less populated islands of Indonesia. This program has met with\nmixed results, sometimes causing conflicts between the locals and the recently\narrived settlers. Nevertheless, it has caused Java's share of the nation's\npopulation to progressively decline.\n\nJakarta and its outskirts, being the dominant metropolis, is also home to\npeople from all over the nation. East Java is also home to ethnic Balinese, as\nwell as large numbers of Madurans due to their historic poverty.\n\n### Ethnicity and culture[edit]\n\nSee also: Culture of Indonesia, Music of Java, and Music of Sunda\n\nBetawi mask dance (Tari Topeng Betawi)SambaSunda music performance, featuring\ntraditional Sundanese music instrumentsLakshmana, Rama and Shinta in Ramayana\nballet at Prambanan, Java\n\nDespite its large population and in contrast to the other larger islands of\nIndonesia, Java is comparatively homogeneous in ethnic composition. Only two\nethnic groups are native to the island\u2014the Javanese and Sundanese. A third\ngroup is the Madurese, who inhabit the island of Madura off the northeast\ncoast of Java, and have immigrated to East Java in large numbers since the\n18th century.^[55] The Javanese comprise about two-thirds of the island's\npopulation, while the Sundanese and Madurese account for 38% and 10%\nrespectively.^[55] The fourth group is the Betawi people that speak a dialect\nof Malay, they are the descendants of the people living around Batavia from\naround the 17th century. Betawis are creole people, mostly descended from\nvarious Indonesian archipelago ethnic groups such as Malay, Sundanese,\nJavanese, Balinese, Minang, Bugis, Makassar, Ambonese, mixed with foreign\nethnic groups such as Portuguese, Dutch, Arab, Chinese and Indian brought to\nor attracted to Batavia to meet labour needs. They have a culture and language\ndistinct from the surrounding Sundanese and Javanese.^[citation needed]\n\nThe Javanese prose text Tantu Pagelaran (c. 15th century) explained the\nmythical origin of the island and its volcanic nature.^[citation needed]\n\nFour major cultural areas exist on the island: the central part of Java or\nYogyakarta is the Javanese people heartland and the north coast of the pasisir\nregion, the Sunda lands (Sundanese: \u1b92\u1b92\u1b81 \u1b9e\u1ba5\u1b94\u1baa\u1b93, Tatar Sunda) in the western\npart of Java and Parahyangan as the heartland, the eastern salient of Java\nalso known as Blambangan. Madura makes up a fifth area having close cultural\nties with coastal eastern Java.^[55] The kejawen of Javanese culture is the\nisland's most dominant. Java's remaining aristocracy is based here, and it is\nthe region from where the majority of Indonesia's army, business, and\npolitical elite originate. Its language, arts, and etiquette are regarded as\nthe island's most refined and exemplary.^[55] The territory from Banyumas in\nthe west through to Blitar in the east and encompasses Indonesia's most\nfertile and densely populated agricultural land.^[55]\n\nIn the southwestern part of Central Java, which is usually named the\nBanyumasan region, a cultural mingling occurred; bringing together Javanese\nculture and Sundanese culture to create the Banyumasan culture.^[56] In the\ncentral Javanese court cities of Yogyakarta and Surakarta, contemporary kings\ntrace their lineages back to the pre-colonial Islamic kingdoms that ruled the\nregion, making those places especially strong repositories of classical\nJavanese culture. Classic arts of Java include gamelan music and wayang puppet\nshows.^[citation needed]\n\nJava was the site of many influential kingdoms in the Southeast Asian\nregion,^[57] and as a result, many literary works have been written by\nJavanese authors. These include Ken Arok and Ken Dedes, the story of the\norphan who usurped his king, and married the queen of the ancient Javanese\nkingdom; and translations of Ramayana and Mahabharata. Pramoedya Ananta Toer\nis a famous contemporary Indonesian author, who has written many stories based\non his own experiences of having grown up in Java, and takes many elements\nfrom Javanese folklore and historical legends.\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\nLanguages spoken in Java (Javanese is shown in white). \"Malay\" refers to\nBetawi, the local dialect as one of Malay creole dialect.\n\nThe three major languages spoken on Java are Javanese, Sundanese and Madurese.\nOther languages spoken include Betawi (a Malay dialect local to the Jakarta\nregion), Osing, Banyumasan, and Tenggerese (closely related to Javanese),\nBaduy and Bantenese (closely related to Sundanese), Kangeanese (closely\nrelated to Madurese), and Balinese.^[58] The vast majority of the population\nalso speaks Indonesian, often as a second language.^[citation needed]\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\nReligion in Java (2023)^[59]\n\nIslam (96.06%)\n\nProtestant (2.26%)\n\nRoman Catholic (1.07%)\n\nBuddhism (0.48%)\n\nHinduism (0.11%)\n\nAliran Kepercayaan (0.01%)\n\nConfucianism (0.013%)\n\nIndian influences came first with Shaivism and Buddhism penetrating deeply\ninto society, blending with indigenous tradition and culture.^[60] One conduit\nfor this were the ascetics, called resi, who taught mystical practices. A resi\nlived surrounded by students, who took care of their master's daily needs.\nResi's authorities were merely ceremonial. At the courts, Brahmin clerics and\npudjangga (sacred literati) legitimised rulers and linked Hindu cosmology to\ntheir political needs.^[60] Small Hindu enclaves are scattered throughout\nJava, but there is a large Hindu population along the eastern coast nearest\nBali, especially around the town of Banyuwangi.^[citation needed]\n\nThe coming of Islam, strengthened the status structure of this traditional\nreligious pattern. More than 90 percent of the people of Java are Sunni\nMuslims with very minority being Shia and Ahmadis (respectively 1% and 0.2%),\non a broad continuum between abangan (more traditional) and santri (more\nmodernist). Muslim scholars (Kyai) became the new religious elite as Hindu\ninfluences receded. Islam recognises no hierarchy of religious leaders nor a\nformal priesthood, but the Dutch colonial government established an elaborate\nrank order for mosque and other Islamic preaching schools. In Javanese\npesantren (Islamic schools), The Kyai perpetuated the tradition of the resi.\nStudents around him provided his needs, even peasants around the school.^[60]\n\n  * A Hindu shrine dedicated to King Siliwangi in Pura Parahyangan Agung Jagatkarta, Bogor\n\n  * Mendut Vihara, a Buddhist monastery near Mendut temple, Magelang\n\n  * Masjid Gedhe Kauman in Yogyakarta, built in traditional Javanese multi-tiered roof\n\n  * Ganjuran Church in Bantul, built in traditional Javanese architecture\n\nPre-Islamic Javan traditions have encouraged Islam in a mystical direction.\nThere emerged in Java a loosely structured society of religious leadership,\nrevolving around kyais, possessing various degrees of proficiency in pre-\nIslamic and Islamic lore, belief and practice.^[60] The kyais are the\nprincipal intermediaries between the villages masses and the realm of the\nsupernatural. However, this very looseneess of kyai leadership structure has\npromoted schism. There were often sharp divisions between orthodox kyais, who\nmerely instructed in Islamic law, with those who taught mysticism and those\nwho sought to reform Islam with modern scientific concepts. As a result, there\nis a division between santri, who believe that they are more orthodox in their\nIslamic belief and practice, with abangan, who have mixed pre-Islamic\nanimistic and Hindu-Indian concepts with a superficial acceptance of Islamic\nbelief.^[60]\n\nThere are also Christian communities, mostly in the larger cities, though some\nrural areas of south-central Java are strongly Roman Catholic. Buddhist\ncommunities also exist in the major cities, primarily among the Chinese\nIndonesian. The Indonesian constitution recognises six official religions.\n\nA wider effect of this division is the number of sects. In the middle of 1956,\nthe Department of Religious Affairs in Yogyakarta reported 63 religious sects\nin Java other than the official Indonesian religions. Of these, 35 were in\nCentral Java, 22 in West Java and six in East Java.^[60] These include\nKejawen, Sumarah, Subud, etc. Their total membership is difficult to estimate\nas many of their adherents identify themselves with one of the official\nreligions.^[61] Sunda Wiwitan is a traditional Sundanese religion, its\nadherents still exist in several villages.^[62]\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\nWater buffalo ploughing rice fields near Salatiga, in Central Java\n\nInitially the economy of Java relied heavily on rice agriculture. Ancient\nkingdoms such as the Kingdoms of Sunda, Mataram, and Majapahit were dependent\non rice yields and tax. Java was famous for rice surpluses and rice export\nsince ancient times, and rice agriculture contributed to the population growth\nof the island. Trade with other parts of Asia such as ancient India and China\nflourished as early as the 4th century, as evidenced by Chinese ceramics found\non the island dated to that period. Java also took part in the global trade of\nMaluku spice from ancient times in the Majapahit era, until well into the\nDutch East India Company (VOC) era.^[citation needed]\n\nJava transport network\n\nThe VOC set their foothold on Batavia in the 17th century and was succeeded by\nthe Dutch East Indies in the 19th century. During these colonial times, the\nDutch introduced the cultivation of commercial plants in Java, such as\nsugarcane, rubber, coffee, tea, and quinine. In the 19th and early 20th\ncentury, Javanese coffee gained global popularity. Thus, the name \"Java\" today\nhas become a synonym for coffee.^[63]^[64]^[65]^[66]\n\n\"Welcome!\" statue in Central Jakarta\n\nJava has been Indonesia's most developed island since the Dutch East Indies\nera and continues to be so today in the modern Republic of Indonesia. The road\ntransportation networks that have existed since ancient times were connected\nand perfected with the construction of Java Great Post Road by Daendels in the\nearly 19th century. It became the backbone of Java's road infrastructure and\nlaid the base of Java North Coast Road (Indonesian: Jalan Pantura,\nabbreviation from \"Pantai Utara\"). The need to transport commercial produces\nsuch as coffee from plantations in the interior of the island to the harbour\non the coast spurred the construction of railway networks in Java. Today,\nindustry, business, trade and services flourished in major cities of Java,\nsuch as Jakarta, Surabaya, Semarang, and Bandung; while some traditional\nSultanate cities such as Yogyakarta, Surakarta, and Cirebon preserved its\nroyal legacy and has become the centre of art, culture and tourism. Industrial\nestates are also growing in towns on northern coast of Java, especially around\nCilegon, Tangerang, Bekasi, Karawang, Gresik and Sidoarjo. The toll road\nhighway networks was built and expanded since the New Order until the present\nday, connecting major urban centres and surrounding areas, such as in and\naround Jakarta and Bandung; also the ones in Cirebon, Semarang and Surabaya.\nIn addition to these motorways, Java has 16 national highways.\n\nBased on the statistical data by the year of 2021 released by Statistics\nIndonesia (Badan Pusat Statistik), Java alone contributes around 60% of\nIndonesia's GDP or equivalent to US$686 billion (int$2.0 trillion, PPP).^[67]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Indonesia portal\n  * Islands portal\n\n  * History of Indonesia\n  * List of monarchs of Java\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ /\u02c8d\u0292\u0251\u02d0v\u0259, \u02c8d\u0292\u00e6v\u0259/;^[2] Indonesian: Jawa, pronounced [\u02c8d\u0292awa]; Javanese: \ua997\ua9ae; Sundanese: \u1b8f\u1b9d\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"Sekretariat Kabinet Republik Indonesia | Hasil Sensus Penduduk 2020; BPS: Meski Lambat, Ada Pergeseran Penduduk Antarpulau\". 23 January 2021.
