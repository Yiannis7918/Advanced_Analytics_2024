It will save lives.\u201d\n\nThe rule, which clarifies who is considered to be \u201cengaged in the business\u201d as\na firearms dealer, will take effect in 30 days\u2019 time, and follows a three-\nmonth consultation period that attracted almost 388,000 comments to the\nwebsite of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).\n\nThe White House estimates that 22% of guns owned by Americans were acquired\nwithout a background check and that about 23,000 more individuals will be\nrequired to be licensed as a dealer after the rule\u2019s implementation.\n\n\u201cThere is a large and growing black market of guns being sold by people in the\nbusiness of dealing and doing it without a license, and therefore they are not\nrunning background checks the way the law requires,\u201d the ATF director, Steven\nDettelbach, said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not safe for innocent, law-abiding Americans. In fact, it\u2019s doggone\ndangerous.\u201d\n\nGarland presented the rule as a hardening of the 2022 bipartisan Safer\nCommunities Act, which said all persons \u201cwho devote time, attention, and labor\nto dealing in firearms as a regular course of trade or business to\npredominantly earn a profit\u201d would be considered a dealer.\n\n\u201cThe regulation expands the definition of who must obtain a license and\nconduct a background check before selling guns,\u201d Garland said.\n\n\u201cIt will close the gun show loophole, and it closes the fire-sale loophole by\nclarifying how firearms dealers who go out of business must go about\nliquidating their inventory.\u201d\n\nIntra-family transfers of firearms, or occasional sales to enhance a\ncollection, will not be presumed business transactions, a White House\nspokesperson said.\n\nThe new rule is the latest in a series of unilateral steps the Biden\nadministration has taken to tighten gun laws, while at the same time\nhighlighting the difficulty of getting legislation through Congress.\n\nRepublicans were lukewarm to near-identical proposals by Barack Obama in 2016,\ntowards the end of his second term, while Biden was vice-president; and, with\na current House majority, have been resistant to calls for meaningful gun\ncontrol measures since.\n\nLast month, Kamala Harris, the vice-president, visited Parkland, Florida, the\nsite of a 2018 high school shooting that claimed 17 lives, to announce the\nsetting up of a national resource center to assist states in implementing red\nflag laws.\n\nIn September, Biden tapped Harris to lead the first federal gun violence\nprevention office, and the pair have repeatedly urged Congress to pass tougher\nregulations, including a ban on private ownership of assault weapons.\n\n\u201cFor decades, many dealers who sell weapons someplace other than the\ntraditional gun store, say a gun show or flea market, or through social media,\nhave gotten away without conducting background checks,\u201d she told reporters on\nthe call.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to First Thing\n\nFree daily newsletter\n\nOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you\nwhat\u2019s happening and why it matters\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

I believe countless families and communities\nwill be spared the horror and heartbreak of gun violence by this new rule.\u201d\n\nGun control advocacy groups welcomed the rule.\n\nGabby Giffords, the former US congresswoman who founded the Giffords center to\nprevent gun violence after she was seriously injured in a 2011 shooting, said:\n\u201cPresident Biden stood strong and saved lives today. His administration took\nbold action to address a gaping loophole that allowed firearm dealers to sell\nguns without performing background checks and let anyone intent on doing harm\nto buy a gun, no questions asked.\n\n\u201cThis new rule will make sure fewer people slip through the cracks, and we\u2019re\nall safer for it.\u201d\n\nMark Barden, who co-founded Sandy Hook Promise after his seven-year-old son\nDaniel was among the 26 victims of a 2012 elementary school shooting in\nNewtown, Connecticut, said: \u201cWhile today\u2019s victory can never take away the\npain of having my youngest son taken from our family, it represents the power\nof our collective voices when we come together to keep kids safe.\n\n\u201cWe are energized to keep up the fight and will work day in and day out to\nensure that this isn\u2019t the last action we see on expanding background checks.\u201d\n\nThe group promoted background check legislation in both chambers of Congress\nlast year and is pressing for a vote, citing studies that show overwhelming\npublic support for such a measure.\n\n\u201cWe sincerely thank the more than 11,000 supporters, including teachers,\nparents, students, gun violence survivors and other concerned community\nmembers, who spoke out in support of this critical rule,\u201d said Nicole Hockley,\nchief executive of Sandy Hook Promise, and mother of Dylan, six, another\nNewtown victim.\n\n\u201cTheir support has been a fountain of hope and we share this victory with\nthem.\u201d\n\nThis article was amended on 11 April 2024. A previous version quoted a White\nHouse spokesperson as saying that \u201cinter-family transfers of firearms ... will\nnot be presumed business transactions\u201d. This reference should have been to\nintra-family transfers, and has been corrected.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * US gun control\n  * Law (US)\n  * Biden administration\n  * Florida\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
