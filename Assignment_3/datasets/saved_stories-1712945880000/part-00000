Enjoy.\n\nDear new developer,\n\nI\u2019m enjoying the season I\u2019m in. That\u2019s the simple phrase I find myself\nconveying to others lately.\n\nI have 21 years of post-college professional experience. Except for a handful\nof short-term consulting gigs, all of that has been working on something I\nfounded or for the acquirer of the thing I founded post-acquisition. This puts\nme in a unique position of never having applied for a job.\n\nI really enjoy creating new things and expressing that through starting new\nbusinesses. Even my current boss identifies me as an entrepreneur in\nconversations with others.\n\nAnd yet, I\u2019m an employee. And I\u2019m enjoying the season I\u2019m in.\n\nMost people who know me would assume that I\u2019m still employed with our acquirer\nbecause I signed an employment contract or that there were stay bonuses that\nkept me around for a specific period. Neither of those happened.\n\nSome aspects of the sale incentivized all of us as HomeSpotter shareholders if\nthe business performed post-acquisition. But those milestones are now behind\nme. And I\u2019m still here.\n\nWhy? You guessed it. I\u2019m enjoying the season I\u2019m in.\n\nEarlier this week, I had an internal meeting at work that I got super\nfrustrated about. I knew we could collectively do better at something. And I\u2019m\ncompetitive and want us to win as an organization.\n\nThe following morning I was still a little salty. But then I just continued my\nday and tackled my priorities. And that frustrating meeting was a distant\nmemory by the next day.\n\nI just spent over 11 years building a single business before selling it. There\nwasn\u2019t a time during that journey I wasn\u2019t 100% all in. I couldn\u2019t brush off\nanything that bothered me about the business within 24 hours.\n\nI still work hard. It\u2019s not in me to not. But it\u2019s different.\n\nI do ~35% of school drop-offs and pick-ups now. I\u2019m figuring out how to run a\nshort-term rental business 2,400 miles away. I traveled more last year than\nany other \u2013 hardly any of that was for work. And Kate and I just decided to\nbuild a new house, and we\u2019re starting that process.\n\nI\u2019m finding ways to level up my management skills in a larger corporate\nenvironment. I\u2019m making an impact on the industry that gave me so much. I\u2019m\nexpanding my product management capacity. And I love working with one of the\nbest teams I\u2019ve assembled.\n\nBut at the end of the day, the buck doesn\u2019t stop with me. And for this season,\nI\u2019m ok with that. I don\u2019t spend my non-existent off hours thinking about cash\nflow and keeping employees paid. I don\u2019t feel the weight of the organization\non me at all times. Not getting to make the final decision on all matters\nfeels like more than a fair exchange in that trade.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long ago that I assumed I\u2019d have put in my notice by now. I\u2019m an\nentrepreneur! I have to start the next thing!\n\nAnd it is inevitable \u2013 I will start other businesses. Eventually. The best\nrepeat entrepreneurs are forgetful. Like mothers who decide to have another\nkid \u2013 they forget about the pain.\n\nBut for now, I\u2019m enjoying the season I\u2019m in.\n\nHonestly, it took a bit of a mental shift for me to get there. It takes\nactively adopting an abundance mindset. I hope you can also find reasons to\nembrace whatever season you\u2019re in.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAaron\n\nThis post was first published here.\n\nAaron Kardell is VP of Product at Lone Wolf Technologies.
