The rule lays out a number of\nacceptable methods for gaining parental consent but also includes a provision\nallowing interested parties to submit new verifiable parental consent methods\nto the Commission for approval.\n\nAfter receiving more than 350 comments, the Commission voted 4-0 to deny the\napplication without prejudice to the applicants filing in the future, when the\nCommission anticipates that additional information will be available to assist\nthe Commission and the public in better understanding age verification\ntechnologies and the application. In declining the application at this time,\nthe Commission is taking no position on the merits of the application.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission works to promote competition and protect and\neducate consumers.
