The emergence of two groups of cicadas will\nassemble a chorus of the insects not seen in several hundred years, experts\nsay.\n\nThe simultaneous appearance of the two cicada broods \u2013 known as Brood XIX and\nBrood XII \u2013 is a rare event, not having occurred since 1803, a year when\nThomas Jefferson was US president. \u201cIt\u2019s really exciting. I\u2019ve been looking\nforward to this for many years,\u201d said Catherine Dana, an entomologist who\nspecializes in cicadas at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. \u201cFor\nthe public, it\u2019s going to be a really special experience.\u201d\n\nThere are thousands of species of cicadas around the world but only 10 are\nconsidered periodical \u2013 having a life cycle that involves the juvenile cicadas\nliving underground and feeding on plant sap for years before emerging en masse\nto the surface.\n\n\u2018This is a spectacular chorus\u2019: walk into the cicada explosion\n\nRead more\n\nThis year will see Brood XIX, the largest of all periodical cicada groups,\nemerge after a 13-year dormancy underground at the same time as Brood XII, a\nsmaller group that appears every 17 years. The emergence will occur in spring,\nas early as this month in some places, and will see trillions of cicadas pop\nup in as many as 16 states, from Maryland to Oklahoma and from Illinois to\nAlabama.\n\nThis phenomenon, which has been dubbed \u201ccicada-geddon\u201d or \u201ccicada-palooza\u201d,\nwill see huge clumps of cicadas across urban and rural areas, where the\ninsects will make quite a noise \u2013 their songs collectively can be louder than\na revving motorbike. After a frenzy of calling and mating and being devoured\nby predators, the cicadas will begin the cycle all over again in July.\n\nThe two broods may only overlap slightly in a small area of central Illinois,\nmeaning there mostly won\u2019t be a larger-than-normal boom in numbers in any one\nplace, but researchers have said the emergence of all seven periodical species\nfound in the US will be noticeable in many places and provide a rare glimpse\nof a grand ecological spectacle.\n\n\u201cI like to remind people that this is a natural wonder of the world. You just\ndon\u2019t see this biomass of terrestrial life anywhere else,\u201d said Dana. There\nare several theories as to why cicadas do this, among the most popular being\nthat an overwhelming surge of the creatures ensures that a good number will\nsurvive predators to spawn the next generation.\n\nSome Americans are planning trips in order to see hotspots of cicadas, with\nother, more insect-phobic people wondering whether they should flee the\nonslaught. Cicadas aren\u2019t harmful to people or pets in any way, though, with\nthe insects having a straw-like mouth rather than any sort of biting parts.\nSome cicadas have been found to expel jets of urine when threatened, however.\n\nAs with most interactions between humans and the natural world, humans pose\nthe bigger threat. Cicadas choose to burst aboveground when the soil\ntemperature hits a certain point \u2013 usually around 64F (17C) \u2013 and global\nheating, caused by the burning of fossil fuels, is potentially scrambling this\nnatural process.\n\n\u201cThis could mess with their phenology. If they come out earlier than usual,\nthat can be problematic for them,\u201d said Dana.\n\nFor now, onlookers can still enjoy this rare burst of nature in their gardens\nand public spaces. \u201cSit back and be in awe at the spectacle,\u201d advised John\nCooley, a cicada expert at the University of Connecticut who tracks the\nemergences. \u201cIt will be over soon enough. Then think about where you will be\nin 13 or 17 years. It\u2019s a time for introspection.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Insects\n  * Wildlife\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Environment\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Wildlife\n  * Energy\n  * Pollution\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
