And every item has a reason to be in the collection, like a\nspecial feature or innovation. Each item also has a story to tell. Stories\nabout industrial design and brands. Or about lifestyle, women's liberation,\npackaging design or useability. Or about how rare an item is and how it has\nfound its way to the collection.\n\nMany items should look familiar if you were born in or before the 1970s, but\nyou haven't seen many of the other items before. They are all forgotten\nproducts. The high quality of these products was never matched again since the\nend of the last century. After that manufacturing has moved completely to\nAsia, and planned obsolescence was put into every product.\n\nIn comparison to Hard Electronics these products were designed and built to be\nused by women in the first place. Each product was supposed to help in daily\nroutines in the household, but still be easy to use and add no extra work or\nmaintenance.\n\n# Exhibition\n\n###\n\nA selection of 250 household devices is shown in the exhibition \u201eMen, women\nand their appliances\u201c at the Design Museum Den Bosch.\n\nOn display until 23 June 2024.
