Talented individuals, particularly those from\nhistorically marginalized communities, may seek opportunities beyond the games\nindustry due to the instability, leading to skill gaps and underrepresentation\nof various demographics.\n\nTo foster a resilient and thriving industry, studios must better plan for\nsustainable growth and stop driving talent away from their own companies and\nthe greater industry.\n\nStudios Must:\n\n  * Maintain short term and long term company and industry forecasts with an understanding that periods of accelerated growth are usually followed by periods of stagnation or even decline.\n  * Keep headcount reductions to a minimum. Drastically reducing headcount only helps short term finances and is costly both in terms of team morale and in training and onboarding when those teams need to be regrown later.\n  * Reduce risk and headcount fluctuations by maintaining multiple projects if possible. Spreading risk over several projects in different stages of development provides a better chance of success and a place to utilize talent as they ramp off of other projects.\n  * Maintain transparent communication with your team and address concerns related to well-being and job security when raised.\n  * Support diversity initiatives and internal roles to help retain the increased diverse talent the games industry has developed over the last decade.\n  * Provide ample support to departing employees to ensure their wellbeing and future success.\n\nThe IGDA will work to create resources for studio leaders and other decision\nmakers to help them to sustainably grow, reduce headcount reductions, and\nbetter forecast the future of their company and the game industry. If you\nwould like to contribute to any of these resources or to recommend or provide\nadditional resources, please contact us at info@igda.org.\n\nTogether, we can navigate the current challenges facing developers and the\nindustry at large with resilience and empathy while building a sustainable\nfuture for games and all those who create them.\n\nResources to Support Those Impacted by Layoffs\n\n  * Application for free IGDA membership + priority in mentorship matching in IGDA\u2019s Global Mentorship Program\n  * Stronger Together in Games \u2013 Consolidated Resource List: includes resources for mental health, community, jobs, and more\n  * Unionization Information: foundational information about unionization in games for developer knowledge, including IGDA\u2019s Worker Empowerment & Unionization in Games Webinar.\n  * IGDA Business Sustainability: Best Practise Guidelines\n  * IGDA Best Practices in Resource Management and Scheduling\n  * IGDA Expert Resource: HR Policy Guidebook Template\n  * IGDA Guide for Game Companies: How to Create and Sustain a Positive Work Culture\n  * IGDA\u2019s Career Center & Resource Library\n  * IGDA\u2019s Consolidated Resource Initiative: The IGDA is aggregating and consolidating available resources and resource lists that are helpful to devs experiencing layoffs, as well as those advancing their game dev careers.
