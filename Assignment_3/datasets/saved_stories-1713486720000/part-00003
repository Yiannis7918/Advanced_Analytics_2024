This influx of pointless\ngems, referencing one of the reasonably popular packages, hinted at an attempt\nto manipulate the tea.xyz protocol. As with any potentially risky incident, we\ndelved deeper into the motives and mechanics behind these submissions. This\nshort article contains our investigation, the conclusions we\u2019ve reached, and\nhow, theoretically, individuals looking to abuse the system can distort the\nidea of rewarding OSS contributions.\n\n## tea.xyz Trigger\n\nThe tea.xyz cryptocurrency creators claim that it came to life to enhance the\nsustainability of open-source software by rewarding projects based on their\ninfluence in the software ecosystem. It claims to utilize a \u2018Proof of\nContribution\u2019 system, inspired by Google\u2019s PageRank, to measure the impact of\nvarious OSS packages.\n\n## The Unintended Consequences\n\nHowever, good intentions often come with challenges. At RubyGems.org, we began\nnoticing a strange trend: the proliferation of empty gems. These gems weren\u2019t\nharmful per se but were peculiar in their consistent reference to a mildly\npopular OSS package.\n\n## Investigating the Anomalies\n\nAs with any deviation in the ecosystem, we began an investigation. We\nconsidered multiple scenarios:\n\n  * A spam attack to overwhelm our system.\n  * A cover for malicious activities.\n  * A scheme to manipulate tea.xyz ranking system.\n\nWhat struck us was that many of these gems were published under account with\notherwise legitimate packages.\n\nDigging deeper, we discovered that these accounts linked to a gem with over\n100,000 downloads, which had its GitHub source changed after six years to\ninclude a tea.yaml file. This was a moment in our investigation that suggested\nthe activities were aimed at exploiting the tea.xyz protocol rather than\nharming our ecosystem.\n\n## Addressing the Issue\n\nThis realization led us to tighten our gem publishing limitations and increase\nmonitoring for non-malicious but unexpected user behaviors. During the\ncleanup, we had minor, temporary delays in gem index updates. We also took\nstrict action against accounts solely created for spamming, ensuring they\ndidn\u2019t disrupt the community further.\n\n## Conclusion and Appeal\n\nWhile rewarding open-source contributions may seem noble, it can lead to\nunintended consequences, affecting RubyGems.org and other platforms, as\ndetailed by this web3isgoinggreat.com article. At RubyGems.org, we\u2019ve\nencountered exploitation attempts that divert our resources and undermine\ntrust and collaboration within our community. We remain committed to\nmaintaining the integrity of RubyGems.org and supporting the broader open-\nsource community, urging others to refrain from exploitative practices like\nthe one described in this incident report. The RubyGems.org team takes these\nincidents seriously and accounts found violating terms or abusing the service\nwill be blocked and ownership access revoked.\n\nMaciej Mensfeld\n\n2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010\n2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004\n\nStatus Uptime Code Data Discuss Stats Blog About API\n\nRubyGems.org is the Ruby community\u2019s gem hosting service.
