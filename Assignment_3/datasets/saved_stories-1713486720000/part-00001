It's been an eventful year for the\ngenerative art platform, which added support for Ethereum last winter and\nrecently expanded to include Base as well.\n\nNow fxhash is taking a beat to revamp its existing infrastructure, looking to\n\"improve efficiency and velocity\" going forward. Florian explained that some\nof fxhash's technology still dates from the early days when founder ciphrd\n(Baptiste Crespy) was writing everything by himself.\n\nThe first iteration of an ambitious project like fxhash succeeds by getting\nyou where you need to go, above all else \u2014 then once you've arrived, you're\nsort of amazed that the wheels didn't pop off along the way. \"fxhash involves\nmany moving parts, it's very complex machinery,\" Florian told us, so the team\nis focused on rationalization and simplification. We're impressed that fxhash\nis actually addressing tech debt, instead of the traditional solution (hoping\nit will magically disappear).\n\nMeanwhile, fxhash still has an eye to the future. Multichain engineering is\nexciting and fast-paced, with new tools constantly emerging and the paradigm\nof the moment constantly in flux. \"We are at the edge of everything and we are\nexploring anything we want,\" Florian said, which is paradise for lovers of\ntechnology, art, and the combination thereof.\n\n## Split a song of sixpence#\n\nWhen fxhash decided to debut Ethereum, Splits came in handy. fxhash uses\nSplits in two ways, depending on whether the NFT sale is primary or secondary.\nOn primary, revenue is divided between the artist (90% cut) and fxhash (10%\ncut). On secondary, fxhash takes a 25% cut of royalties.\n\n\u2022 fxhash fee details \u2022\n\nSplits makes it easy for the fxhash team to route payments to the right\nrecipients in the correct proportions. According to Florian, the Splits app\nhas also served its purpose. Names and tags \"drastically help us to know where\nwe stand in review,\" and the API makes it practical to rely on those features\nat scale.\n\n## Visions in code#\n\nfxhash facilitates the distribution of generative art. Creative coders define\na possibility space, and then snapshots from that space are minted as NFTs. We\ncurated a selection of artworks currently available to mint on fxhash, for\nyour viewing (and perhaps purchasing) pleasure.\n\nVertical Projection by unsleeping_ik brings to mind an abandoned alien\nsettlement:\n\nVariation owned by 0x0cb27e883E207905AD2A94F9B6eF0C7A99223C37.\n\nA strange kind of physical reality by Amy Goodchild gestures at \"particles\nspreading out as waves and then collapsing into particles again at a moment of\ninteraction.\" Goodman ponders:\n\n> At the quantum scale, classical ideas of space and form come apart, replaced\n> by concepts, probability and mathematics. Yet I cannot help but imagine tiny\n> structures. There are moments when it feels like, if I concentrated closely\n> enough or reached out in just the right way, I could perceive my hand\n> floating through the particle soup.\n\nVariation owned by 0xC13CF604aC4c6C00fc251c8b0345BbD2665bd7cd.\n\nETHygrogen by Obsukiy likewise investigates physics; the series \"invites you\nto immerse yourself in the ethereal beauty of Hydrogen's Quantum Probability\nDensity Functions.\" The artist writes, \"May these artworks inspire you to\nponder the delicate dance of electrons and the harmonious chaos that underlies\nthe fabric of reality.\"\n\nVariation owned by 0x6d81F93D99a51D57573bA355C4890dde5424F424; variation owned\nby 0x1eC945af051F5eDc01319d9047605197B456943f.\n\nCatho by Infinity evokes yesteryear through pattern: \"As the colors shift\nthrough bounds, they inadvertently create an effect reminiscent of the classic\nCRT TV display. This parallel adds a layer of nostalgia to the project,\noffering a contemporary twist on the familiar, pixel-like patterns of old\nscreens.\"\n\nVariation owned by Peter 'pet3rpan'.\n\nRuralRhythms by SaraSmith offers candy-colored townscapes from a video-game\nphantasmagoria:\n\nVariation owned by 0xa5E5d3afE7daF372972559C7Fa3b75cb7A4AE0d7.\n\ng-scapes by joey zaza roams through a landscape of Impressionism on acid, with\nan accompanying soundtrack:\n\nVariation owned by joey zaza, multiple views.\n\nTeardrop by aotearoan is a neo-Bauhaus exploration of shape, contrast, and\nrepetition:\n\nVariation owned by nudoru.\n\n### Subscribe for future updates\n\nWarpcastTwitter\n\nResources\n\nApp\n\nDocs\n\nSDK\n\nContracts\n\nSplit\n\nSwapper\n\nWaterfall\n\nDiversifier\n\nCommunity\n\nWarpcast\n\nGithub\n\nTwitter\n\nEtherscan\n\n\u00a9 2024 Splits Protocols, Inc.\n\nTerms of Service\n\nProtocol Disclaimer\n\n", "frontpage": false}
