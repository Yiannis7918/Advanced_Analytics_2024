By contrast, the\nmove toward inquiry values the opportunity to learn over the desire to\nvalidate one\u2019s existing\u2014and necessarily incomplete\u2014knowledge. That is, inquiry\nis a dynamic, active movement, unlike the stuckness and stagnancy that a\ndecree evokes. Inquiry is an open door; decree, a closed one.\n\nMoreover, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an accident that we associate those hedge words\nwith femininity. Oppression always demands absolutes: unable to stand up to\ninquiry, it marks inquiry as proscribed. But like a king living in a glass\nhouse declaring a ban on bricks, the decree is itself impossible to maintain.\nSooner or later, everyone picks up a stone.\n\n## Related books\n\n# Being Wrong\n\n## Kathryn Schulz\n\nKathryn Schulz posits a vision of wrongness as both the inevitable human\ncondition and a generative source from which creativity, art, brilliance,\nrisk-taking, and so much more arises.\n\n# Newsletter\n\n## Occasional reading notes delivered to your inbox\n\n  * RSS\n  * Colophon\n  * Copyright \u00a9 2008-2024 Mandy Brown\n  * mandy@aworkinglibrary.com\n  * @aworkinglibrary\n\n", "frontpage": false}
