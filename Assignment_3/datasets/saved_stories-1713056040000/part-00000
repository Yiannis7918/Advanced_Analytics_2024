The bill seeks to limit the data that U.S. data\nbrokers could sell about U.S. persons to individuals located in North Korea,\nChina, Russia, or Iran\u2014and to entities headquartered, owned by a person, or\notherwise controlled by the governments in those countries. The measure was\nintroduced just a few weeks ago, alongside a TikTok and foreign-owned app\ndivestment bill, and now heads to the Senate for consideration.\n\nThe central concern behind the bill stems from the highly unregulated U.S.\ndata brokerage industry, composed of thousands of companies in the business of\ncollecting, packaging, and selling data, including identified or easily\nidentifiable data about individuals. Members of Congress in both parties as\nwell as the intelligence community have expressed worries that foreign\nadversaries could use this ecosystem to obtain data on U.S. government\nemployees, clearance-holding contractors, military service members, and other\nindividuals to profile, blackmail, coerce, or target them. The bill also comes\non the heels of an executive order designed largely to place limits on U.S.\ndata brokers\u2019 sale of certain sensitive data to certain foreign actors. The\nHouse Energy and Commerce Committee has demonstrated strong bipartisan\nleadership in drawing attention to these problems.\n\nIt is important to not make the perfect the enemy of the good\u2014and typically,\nany marginal improvement on the status quo when it comes to data brokerage\nwould benefit consumer privacy and national security. There are several\nelements of the bill that are noteworthy in this respect, including the fact\nthat its protections are aimed beyond government personnel, it would not carve\nout sales of covered data below a certain threshold (for example, data set\nsize), and it has a fairly strong definition of sensitive data that it could\nput into federal law. At the same time, given the ongoing executive order\nprocess on bulk data transfers and national security, it is difficult to make\nsense of the reasoning behind this new bill and why Congress is taking such a\nweak approach.\n\nThe bill purports to tackle a problem similar to what the executive order is\nalready addressing under existing law\u2014except by creating a new law, and with\nan ultimately narrower scope, fewer measures to counteract circumventions, a\ndifferent and non-national security-focused enforcement agency in charge, and\na significantly slower timeline for identifying and mitigating national\nsecurity risks. If Congress is going to spend time writing a new law focused\non the data brokerage ecosystem, it should aim bigger and look beyond a\nnational security framework to avoid coming away with a narrower and weaker\nenforcement regime, with less benefit to national security, than the executive\nbranch can build under current law. The bill\u2019s drafters are focused on\nimportant data brokerage problems, and they should be commended for injecting\ndata brokerage into the too narrowly focused policy conversation dominated by\ndebates about TikTok and non-U.S. apps. But the Senate should force a\nsignificant amendment and strengthening of the bill before pushing it forward\nand trying to address the privacy and security risks the House has\nhighlighted.\n\nUnpacking H.R. 7520\u2019s Definitions\n\nThe House bill is in some ways broader than the administration\u2019s executive\norder. It focuses on national security risks from the brokerage of all\nAmericans\u2019 data, not just data on government-linked individuals (a constraint\nthe executive branch has that Congress does not), and it does not have minimum\nthresholds for what counts as a covered data sale. The bill\u2019s description of\nsensitive data builds on a previous comprehensive privacy bill (discussed more\nbelow)\u2014a possible argument alone for getting the bill into law. But the bill\ncompletely excludes from its scope the many first-party collectors of data\nthat also sell it and, in doing so, carves out a significant part of the data\nbrokerage industry and a large driver of the market for geolocation data:\nmobile apps. The bill does not contain language to address the risks of data\npurchases routed through third countries, either. All told, if the executive\nbranch can draft regulations under current law that address risks from both\nfirst- and third-party data collectors selling data, with some attempt to\naddress a piece of the third-country circumvention problem, it is confusing\nwhy Congress is pushing a new law that is weaker and ultimately narrower,\nfocused only on third-party data brokers.\n\nCovering the sale of data about any U.S. individual to the listed countries,\nnot just (as the executive order focuses on) data about defined categories of\nnational security personnel\u2014such as U.S. government contractors, active-duty\nU.S. military personnel, and current and recent, former senior U.S. government\nemployees\u2014is an important choice. The bill defines U.S. individuals as any\nnatural persons residing in the United States. This is a stronger approach to\nthe sale of Americans\u2019 data because it includes more people under its\nprotections. In fact, it\u2019s many multiples more, if you count the more than 2\nmillion people serving in the military (active duty and reserve), the\nestimated 3 million or so people with security clearances, and so on against\nthe 336 million-plus people living in the country.\n\nIt is also a stronger approach because attempting to limit the sale of data\nabout individuals, organizations, or even places through a list-based\nframework is inherently limited. Malicious actors will most likely figure out\nways around it, and in a foreign intelligence context, they can dance around\nthe letter of the law to access data on family members, close acquaintances,\nand others who lie just outside the scope of regulatory coverage. This is one\narea where the White House, the Justice Department, and the Department of\nHomeland Security face legal constraints in the recent executive order, and\nits underlying authority (the International Emergency Economic Powers Act),\nand therefore have to rely on a list-based approach that draws out national\nsecurity risks. It\u2019s much like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) taking a\nlist-based approach to prohibiting the sale of data on defined \u201csensitive\nlocations\u201d\u2014it is an efficient, clearly understandable way for an executive\nbranch agency to mitigate harm in the interim but fundamentally requires new\nfederal laws to tackle the problem.\n\nThe bill does not have minimum thresholds for data set sizes; in other words,\nany covered third-party data broker engaging in the data sales laid out in the\nbill would be subject to regulation, whether it sold data on a single U.S.\nindividual or on 2 million. Such a design is different from the executive\norder\u2019s language, which scopes data brokerage regulations around \u201cbulk\ntransfer\u201d of sensitive personal data and transfers of any size or amount of\ncovered, government-related data. For instance, the proposed regulations\nfollowing the executive order could potentially cover only the transfer of\nmore than 100 U.S. persons\u2019 biometric data on the low end or only the transfer\nof more than 1,000 U.S. persons\u2019 biometric data on the high end. The bill\ndrops this threshold limitation.\n\nThat said, a serious gap in the bill is that it would only prohibit third-\nparty data brokers from selling certain sensitive data, which is not the case\nfor the executive order. (The scope of covered data is discussed next.) This\nis because the bill defines a data broker as\n\n> an entity that, for valuable consideration, sells, licenses, rents, trades,\n> transfers, releases, discloses, provides access to, or otherwise makes\n> available data of United States individuals, that the entity did not collect\n> directly from such individuals, to another entity that is not acting as a\n> service provider.\n\nSome state laws, such as data broker registry laws in California, Vermont,\nTexas, and Oregon, define data brokers (generally) as companies selling data\non individuals with whom they have no direct business relationship. Put\nsimply, they define covered data brokers as third parties that are not selling\ndata on their own customers and users. While many data brokers fall under the\nthird-party category, there are also many first-party data collectors\u2014from\nonline health services to retailers to mobile apps\u2014that sell their own\ncustomers\u2019 and users\u2019 data. For example, much of the booming market for\npeople\u2019s geolocation data\u2014historical data, real-time data, pattern data, and\nmore\u2014is driven by mobile apps that quietly sell their users\u2019 GPS and location\ndata to other organizations. Not covering first-party sale of data means the\nbill would fail to cover a substantial portion of data brokerage activity. It\nalso means, in a national security context, that mobile apps, pharmacies,\nretailers, telehealth services, and social media platforms could sell\nsensitive data types on military and government users to foreign governments\nwith no restriction.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the real irony of this situation: If the Protecting Americans from\nForeign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (the TikTok divestment bill)\nbecame law, and this data broker bill became law as well, TikTok could still\nlegally sell Americans\u2019 data to the Chinese government\u2014whether it was owned by\nByteDance or not.\n\nAdditionally significant is the bill\u2019s definition of \u201csensitive data.\u201d The\nterm includes government-issued identifiers (for example, Social Security\nNumber, passport number); information revealing past, present, or future\nhealth conditions or treatments; financial account, credit card, and income\nnumbers; biometric information; genetic information; \u201cprecise\u201d geolocation\ninformation; and some other data types fairly common to sensitive data lists\nin bills and regulations. Many of these categories are similar to the\ncategories laid out in the recent executive order on bulk data transfer, such\nas genomic data, biometric data, and precise geolocation data. The bill also\ncontains fairly strong language to cover data used to infer the listed data\ntypes.\n\nHowever, the bill notably diverges from many of these other bills,\nregulations, and proposals by including under the scope of sensitive data:\n\n> (G) An individual\u2019s private communications such as voicemails, emails,\n> texts, direct messages, mail, voice communications, and video\n> communications, or information identifying the parties to such\n> communications or pertaining to the transmission of such communications,\n> including telephone numbers called, telephone numbers from which calls were\n> placed, the time calls were made, call duration, and location information of\n> the parties to the call. ...\n>\n> (J) Calendar information, address book information, phone or text logs,\n> photos, audio recordings, or videos, maintained for private use by an\n> individual, regardless of whether such information is stored on the\n> individual\u2019s device or is accessible from that device and is backed up in a\n> separate location.\n>\n> (K) A photograph, film, video recording, or other similar medium that shows\n> the naked or undergarment-clad private area of an individual.\n\nThis is where it becomes clear that the bill drew its definition of \u201csensitive\ndata\u201d from the American Data Privacy and Protection Act, the comprehensive\nprivacy bill from the last Congress, and added in one more line covering\n\u201cinformation that reveals the status of an individual as a member of the Armed\nForces.\u201d The definitions are almost identical.\n\nOf course, the sale of private communications, calendars and related\ninformation, and naked photos and videos, if that were to occur, would\ncertainly pose national security risks. A foreign actor could exploit access\nto Americans\u2019 private communications in a variety of ways, including to\nidentify financial hardship, marital problems, or any other piece of\ninformation that could be used to approach or blackmail an individual to spy.\nOn first glance, the inclusion of this kind of information could raise\ninteresting questions about speech and the transmission of content. The bill\naddresses this head on by clearly stating that a \u201cdata broker\u201d does not\ninclude an entity \u201ctransmitting data, including communications of a United\nStates individual at the rest or direction of such individual\u201d; an entity\n\u201creporting, publishing, or otherwise making available news or information that\nis available to the general public\u201d; or an entity \u201cacting as a service\nprovider.\u201d This would appear to address concerns about communications. Putting\nall of these considerations together, there could be an argument, despite the\nbill\u2019s many drawbacks, that it would be valuable for the U.S. to get this\n\u201csensitive data\u201d definition passed into federal law.\n\nThe bill also limits data sales to entities \u201ccontrolled by a foreign\nadversary\u201d in China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea (drawing the country list\nfrom 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 4872). An entity is defined as \u201ccontrolled by a foreign\nadversary\u201d if the entity or at least 20 percent of its owners are domiciled,\nheadquartered, principally operating, or legally organized in a foreign\ncountry on the list; or if the entity is a person \u201csubject to the direction or\ncontrol of a foreign person or entity\u201d domiciled, headquartered, principally\noperating, or legally organized in a foreign country on the list.\nInterestingly, this language does not explicitly call out potential buyers\u2019\nconnections to foreign governments or intelligence services per se but,\ninstead, orients the national security concerns around where individuals and\norganizations are based, ostensibly due to concern about authoritarian\ngovernments\u2019 intelligence laws and extralegal coercive measures. As for the\nfour countries: They are well familiar to anyone reading national security\ndocuments, such as the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s annual worldwide threat\nassessment. The bill\u2019s list is slightly shorter than the one the Commerce\nDepartment developed in response to Executive Order 13873 from 2019, which\nincludes China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea as well as Cuba and Venezuela.\n\nSignificantly, the bill does not make any mention of third countries, or cases\nwhere, for instance, a Chinese intelligence agency could use an intermediary\nshell company in Europe to acquire data. This has been a criticism of the\nexecutive order\u2014that it will not stop all sales. While this idea of\neliminating risk completely is a false bar for the executive order or other\nnational security policies, there is a greater reason why the executive branch\nfaces constraints in tackling those activities; it has to draw on existing\nlaws and authorities. Congress, however, does not. The stated national\nsecurity concerns about data brokerage again lead to the question of why the\nbill does not aim to do more through new law.\n\nLimits to the Bill\u2019s Enforcement Regime\n\nThe way the bill would be enforced\u2014and, thus, deliver the purported\nprotections that would be afforded to Americans\u2019 data and national security\u2014is\nquite limited. On top of the exclusion of first-party data brokers and other\nlimits covered in the preceding section, the enforcement regime proposed by\nthe bill is substantially weakened by giving the FTC not broad privacy\nauthority, but a national security-focused data authority. The FTC is deeply\nexpert on data privacy but is not set up, institutionally or in knowledge, to\ndeal with fast-moving national security issues; one can count on a single hand\nthe number of FTC employees with high security clearances, and the standard of\nmultiyear case timelines is unworkable in a fast-paced national security\ncontext. These limits in enforcement approach again point back to the need for\nCongress to pass a broader bill regulating data brokerage generally\u2014and to\ngive the FTC more authorities in that vein.\n\nUnder the bill, any violation of the data sale prohibitions by a third-party\ndata broker would be considered an \u201cunfair or deceptive act or practice\u201d under\nSection 5 of the FTC Act. This would give the FTC the power to investigate and\nbring enforcement actions against violators, as it already does for companies\nviolating the FTC Act currently with respect to facial recognition abuses,\ndeceptive privacy statements, or breaches of consumer health data. If the bill\nwas broadly about consumer privacy and investigating company data practices,\nthis assignment of authority would make total sense and fit in with work the\nFTC is already doing. When it comes to a national security context, however,\nthe reasoning is less sound.\n\nMake no mistake: The FTC is doing important, leading work to address data\nbrokerage and risks to consumers\u2019 privacy. But the FTC\u2019s primary expertise\nareas surround consumer protection, privacy, and antitrust rather than\nnational security and foreign governments\u2019 intelligence operations. If\nCongress is going to give the FTC new authorities around data brokerage, it\nshould give the commission authorities to protect all consumers against all\nkinds of privacy risks, not just against selected activities defined to impact\nnational security. Congress\u2019s concern should be how all individuals in the\nU.S. are impacted by the data brokerage industry, spanning everything from\ncounterintelligence risks to ongoing harms of stalking and gendered violence,\nthreats to judges and elected officials, scams of elderly people suffering\nfrom Alzheimer\u2019s, and predatory targeting of people seeking medical care. The\nlegislature alone has the power to put those kinds of comprehensive reforms in\nplace.\n\nAnd even if Congress did want additional provisions in law focused\nspecifically on data brokerage and national security, the FTC is not set up to\nsystematically ingest classified intelligence and assess national security\nissues across the organization, such as the ways in which Chinese or Russian\nintelligence agencies covertly obtain data about U.S. persons to blackmail\ntargets, build dossiers on selected individuals, or otherwise run intelligence\noperations. As of October 2022, according to a congressional letter, just four\npeople at the FTC had high-level (Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented\nInformation, or TS/SCI) security clearances. Foreign governments could\ntherefore buy Americans\u2019 sensitive data through intermediaries or use proxy\ngroups or front companies to acquire data, and the FTC would not be as well\nequipped as some other agencies to track and access the intelligence needed to\ndetect those activities. The House bill\u2019s choice of enforcement organization\nfor a national security scope would greatly undermine its effectiveness.\n\nIt is a continual problem that Congress has a stream of bills seeking to give\nthe FTC more authority to protect against data privacy abuses (a positive\nstep) but without enough conversation on the Hill about giving the FTC any\nadditional resources for its privacy team to scale up enforcement. The FTC has\nfor years had approximately 40 attorneys in its privacy division working to\nprotect hundreds of millions of people\u2014a testament to the attorneys\u2019 expertise\nand incredible case output and a repeating signal of the legislature\u2019s failure\non increasing funding. Many of the offices and staffers supporting the House\u2019s\ndata broker bill have spent years working on privacy and well understand this\npoint; many of them, in fact, are in the small group in Congress calling over\nand over to direct more funding to the FTC. Yet, it is worth stating this\nproblem nonetheless, because it impacts the national security issues discussed\nabove and the FTC\u2019s ability to substantially invest in hiring security-cleared\npeople to work on cases.\n\nThis comes back to the need to give the FTC wider privacy authorities not\nheavily dependent on understanding foreign governments\u2019 data-gathering\nactivities, intelligence objectives, and secret networks of proxy groups and\nfront companies. The prime example of those wider authorities would be heavily\nrestricting or outright banning the sale of U.S. persons\u2019 sensitive data to\nany organization, foreign or domestic\u2014because the FTC could investigate and\nenforce against data sales themselves without needing access to sensitive\nintelligence about foreign governments.\n\nAnother reason for wider legal reform is that FTC cases on data privacy and\ncybersecurity abuses take years. This is already too long in a consumer\nprotection context\u2014another reason for Congress to give the FTC and its\nprolific attorneys more funding and empower them to move faster\u2014but is\nespecially too long in a national security context. If a foreign intelligence\nagency is buying location and financial data on U.S. military bases to inform\nrecruitment of spies in the military, the U.S. government cannot afford to\nwait years to merely find out a U.S. company is part of the transaction. Every\nday that goes by could mean more information exposed or more individuals\nprofiled and targeted. The timeline for identifying and mitigating risks needs\nto be far quicker. This again begs the question of why the bill is constructed\nin such a fashion; if Congress is creating new legal authorities to address\nrisks associated with data brokerage, it should heavily regulate all sales of\ndata on Americans and give the FTC greatly enhanced powers to protect all\npeople. Should Congress specifically wish to pursue measures to additionally\naddress national security risks, the law it writes should not create a slower\nprocess than the one the executive branch is already building.\n\nLegislators with the power to protect all Americans\u2019 privacy from this\necosystem should use it\u2014and doing so will ultimately improve protections for\nnational security as well.\n\nH.R. 7520, Off to the Senate\n\nThe Senate will now consider the legislation. It is again commendable that the\nHouse Energy and Commerce Committee has done much work on data privacy\nlegislation and has drawn attention to the risks posed by data brokerage to\nAmericans\u2019 privacy and safety as well as U.S. national security. The sponsors\nare right to focus on this problem and what kinds of privacy measures can be\nimplemented in the absence of a comprehensive federal privacy law.\n\nNonetheless, Congress is looking to pass a law that would seemingly hardly do\nmore (if at all) than the executive branch is already able to do under\nexisting law\u2014which, given the extraordinary lack of U.S. data privacy and\ncybersecurity laws, is telling about the weakness and narrowness of the bill\u2019s\nscope. Prohibiting the sale of data about lists of people or locations is a\nfine approach in the interim for the executive branch but a doomed-to-fail\napproach for legislators. As mentioned above, foreign governments could\ncontinue targeting people in the national security community through\ncommercial data by just widening the net on individuals in the targets\u2019\nnetworks, outside the scope of the law. The failure to include any provisions\nabout data sales to third countries further underscores the gaps in the bill\u2019s\nnarrow approach to data privacy and security regulation. It is important to\nrecognize partial measures for what they are, particularly when the need for\nmeaningfully new legislation is so great.\n\nThe best step for the Senate is to propose considerable amendments to the\nbill. Ideally, this would include designing restrictions on the sale of data\nto protect all Americans, especially individuals constantly impacted by\nstalking and gendered violence, not just those whose data is sold to certain\nforeign entities. For instance, Congress could consider banning the sale of\nAmericans\u2019 geolocation data and biometric data. Any Senate revisions to the\nbill should also come with discussion of greatly increased funding for the\nFTC, which has undertaken years of strongly bipartisan work on data privacy\nand cybersecurity enforcement\u2014and desperately needs the resources to increase\nits impact. And if the bill does carve out any narrow areas of data sales, it\nshould impose strong requirements on companies to implement comprehensive\nprivacy, security, and compliance control programs for how data is gathered,\naggregated, analyzed, stored, sold, and ultimately used, which can then be\nassessed by independent, third-party auditors and regulators.\n\nIf the Senate did choose to stick with the national security lens (which is\nagain not preferable to comprehensive protections), then it needs to do\nsubstantially more than is happening under current law and executive\nauthority. To accomplish this, the bill should drop the complete exclusion of\nfirst-party data brokers, add additional requirements into law for data\nbrokers to track and vet their customers in all countries, require regular\nreporting from the covered companies to executive branch regulatory agencies,\nand ensure there is a way for both privacy experts and national security\nexperts\u2014who can access sensitive intelligence on foreign governments\u2019 data-\ngathering activities\u2014to make the enforcement regime effective.\n\nThere are at least two obvious counterarguments that could be raised. One is\nthat executive orders come and go, and there is no guarantee that a future\nadministration, regardless of political party, keeps the current executive\norder and attached regulations in place. It is of course true that executive\norders do not have the staying power of a federal law. But this does not\nnegate the point that Congress should pass a robust law, even if just a robust\nfederal law focused on data brokerage (and leaving comprehensive privacy\nlegislation writ large to a full package). Executive action potentially\nchanging on a dime and the public needing comprehensive federal laws to\nprotect against data harms are not mutually exclusive. The second, obvious\ncounterargument that could be raised to this article is that Congress needs to\npass what is \u201cpolitically feasible\u201d and that excluding first-party sellers of\ndata from coverage\u2014from mobile apps to major telehealth platforms\u2014is the\neasiest path to passage. Yet this appears contradictory to Congress\u2019s ability\nand responsibility to protect constituents from harm\u2014because members should\nnot be simultaneously stating that they believe there are considerable\nnational security risks posed by the sale of Americans\u2019 data, so much so that\nthis bill is receiving attention and follow-through over many other policy\nissues, and that they also are willing to exempt and not push back against a\nconsiderable portion of the data brokerage market selling that very data.\n\nWhile the current bill draws attention to an important issue\u2014and its coverage\nof all Americans, fairly strong definition of sensitive data, and lack of a\nminimum data set threshold limitation are all positives\u2014it has much further to\ngo to make an impact.\n\nTopics:\n\nCongress Cybersecurity & Tech Surveillance & Privacy\n\nBack to Top\n\n### Justin Sherman\n\n@jshermcyber\n\nRead More\n\nJustin Sherman is a contributing editor at Lawfare.
