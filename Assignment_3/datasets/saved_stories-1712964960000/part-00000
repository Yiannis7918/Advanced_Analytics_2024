Back in 2011-12, when the\nGreat Recession was still lingering and the European debt crisis was raging,\neveryone wanted to hear why the economists had gotten it all wrong. By \u201cthe\neconomists\u201d, of course, they meant macroeconomists \u2014 nobody wanted to hear\njeremiads against labor economists doing careful empirical studies of minimum\nwages, or tax theorists quietly working out the impact of changes in\ninternational tax policy. That stuff\u2019s boring. Macro \u2014 the grand theories of\nbooms and busts, growth, trade, inequality, and so on \u2014 has always been the\nglamor division of economics, and it was macro that people wanted to see taken\ndown a peg.\n\nAnd so we did. The intellectual revolution that I got to be a tiny part of in\nthe early 2010s largely succeeded. In the decade since, the status of academic\n(macro)economists has fallen among the U.S. political class. The demotion\nbegan under Donald Trump, who downgraded the head of the Council of Economic\nAdvisers from a cabinet-level post, and whose economic advisers consisted\nmainly of businessmen like Steve Mnuchin, right-wing think-tankers like\nStephen Moore, and \u2014 to be brutally honest \u2014 hacks like Peter Navarro.\n\nBiden has largely continued this trend. Janet Yellen was a prestigious\neconomics professor, but Biden\u2019s CEA leadership is mostly think-tankers, and\nits chief economist up until this month was Ernie Tedeschi, who has a Master\u2019s\nin public policy and primarily worked as a private-sector economist in the\nfinance industry. (This is not a knock on Ernie, who is a very smart and good\nguy; just a demonstration that academic cred is no longer at the premium it\nonce was.) Meanwhile, anecdotally, economists are no longer regarded as the\nall-purpose sages they once were \u2014 Tyler Cowen still has excellent advice on\nwhere to get lunch, but the fact that he is an economist no longer seems to\nlend that advice a special sheen of intellectual authority.\n\nThe blogger rebellion gave voice to built-up frustrations, but ultimately the\ncause of (macro)econ\u2019s loss of prestige was its obvious failure to stay\nrelevant in a changing world.\n\nThe financial crisis was a big part of that, of course \u2014 economic theorists\nlargely failed to anticipate the possibility of such a crisis, to observe the\nrisks building up, to anticipate the consequences of the crash, or to prepare\na policy response \u2014 a very rare exception being Ben Bernanke, whom we were\nvery lucky to have as Fed chair in 2008-9. (Ironically, the post-pandemic\ninflation has conformed much, much more closely to standard textbook\nmacroeconomics, and few people have noticed or cared.)\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just the financial crisis. There was a whole litany of macro\nthings that seemed to have gone very wrong, right under the economists\u2019 noses.\nThe profession barely even paid attention to the long rise in inequality that\nbegan in the 1970s, and when they did start to pay attention, they had few\ntheories to explain it. Economists had almost dogmatically supported free\ntrade, and were thus blindsided by the China Shock in the 2000s. And the\nrelentless focus on shareholder value as the one goal of a corporation seemed\nto have financialized the economy, with managers now focused on slashing jobs\nto juice quarterly profits rather than investing in innovation for long-term\ngrowth.\n\nSo it made sense to stop listening to (macro)economists quite so much \u2014 or at\nleast, to no longer give them pride of place, and to supplement their\nperspectives with people from different backgrounds. But that left many\neconomists themselves casting around forlornly for the relevance they once\nenjoyed. A prime example is Angus Deaton, who won the Econ Nobel in 2015, but\nwho now spends much of his time making public mea culpas for both himself and\nhis profession. In a recent post on the International Monetary Fund\u2019s website\ncalled \u201cRethinking My Economics\u201d, Deaton rattled off a whole list of things\nthat he thinks economics has gotten wrong and needs to change.\n\nThis is, in principle, a healthy exercise. But Deaton\u2019s post reads like a\npastiche of populist political causes from the 2010s that are already starting\nto go stale, along with a few inside-baseball methodological gripes that he\u2019s\nbeen nursing for a while. Ultimately it still seems to take it for granted\nthat economists are still the West\u2019s key intellectuals. It, and other\ncritiques like it, have largely failed to grapple with what I see as the key\nproblem \u2014 the fact that macroeconomic theory itself, as it\u2019s practiced today,\nis ill-suited to helping us understand the problems we face.\n\nSo first let\u2019s go through Deaton\u2019s critiques, and then I\u2019ll talk a bit about\nwhat I think the real problem is, and how it could be fixed.\n\n####\n\nDeaton\u2019s complaints (and others like them)\n\n## Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Noah Smith.\n\nOr upgrade your subscription.
