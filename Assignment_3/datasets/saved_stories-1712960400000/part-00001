Instead, the bottleneck is the heart\u2019s ability to pump oxygen-rich\nblood to the muscles, or the muscles\u2019 ability to make use of that oxygen.\nThat\u2019s why the heart and muscles get bigger and stronger in response to\ntraining, while the lungs stay the same: we already suck in more oxygen than\nwe\u2019re able to use.\n\nOr maybe not, according to a new study in Medicine & Science in Sports &\nExercise that takes a fresh look at what it means to be out of breath. It\nturns out there are different subtypes of breathlessness. Your chest might\nfeel tight; or your breathing muscles might feel overworked; or you might feel\nthat you can\u2019t get enough air in. That last one, sometimes called \u201cair hunger\u201d\nor (more scientifically) \u201cunsatisfied inspiration\u201d is usually associated with\nlung conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. But the new study\nfinds that about a third of healthy adults experience air hunger during all-\nout exercise\u2014and it\u2019s the fittest people who are most susceptible.\n\n## Air Hunger Research\u2014Led by a Mountain Athlete\n\nDr. Jordan Guenette is a champion runner, along with being a researcher at the\nUniversity of British Columbia.

But That\u2019s Not the Worst Part.\n\nSports Psychology Has an Evidence Problem\n\nThe study, headed by researcher (and accomplished mountain runner) Jordan\nGuenette and graduate student Olivia Ferguson of the University of British\nColumbia, reanalyzed earlier results from lung-function tests completed by 321\nhealthy adults between the ages of 19 and 40 in labs at the University of\nBritish Columbia and McGill University in Canada. Among the tests was an\nincremental cycle to exhaustion, after which subjects were given a list of 15\nphrases that described subjective sensations of breathlessness and asked to\npick which ones applied to them.\n\nFour of the phrases corresponded to air hunger: \u201cI cannot get enough air in,\u201d\n\u201cI cannot take a deep breath in,\u201d \u201cMy breath does not go in all the way,\u201d and\n\u201cI feel a need for more air.\u201d Those who picked at least three of those four\nphrases were classified as having air hunger. Healthy adults usually associate\nbreathlessness with the perception that their breathing muscles are working\nreally hard, rather than with air hunger. But to the surprise of the research\nteam, 34 percent of the subjects fell into the air hunger category.\n\n> One version of the story is that fitter people can push themselves harder\n> for longer, but their lungs aren\u2019t equipped to handle the higher load, so\n> they\u2019re more likely to approach their breathing limits.\n\nAir hunger doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you\u2019re truly short of oxygen\u2014but it\nfeels that way, which is enough to create problems. There are two distinct\ndimensions of breathlessness: the sensory experience (what it feels like) and\nthe affective/emotional response (how you react to that feeling). Air hunger\nis a sensory experience, but it\u2019s tightly linked to a negative emotional\nresponse. No one likes to feel that they can\u2019t get enough air in. In patients\nwith lung disease, the feeling of air hunger is a major deterrent to exercise\neven when it doesn\u2019t directly compromise exercise capacity.\n\nTo figure out if the same thing happens in healthy adults, the subjects were\nalso asked to rate the discomfort in their legs on a scale of zero to ten, do\nthe same for breathing discomfort, and make as estimate of how much their\ndecision to give up in the exercise test was due to leg and breathing\ndiscomfort, respectively. Sure enough, breathing discomfort was higher in the\nair hunger group, and about half of them said that it played a part in their\ndecision to quit, compared to less than 30 percent in the non-air hunger\ngroup.\n\n## Burning Lungs, CIC, and Physical Limitations\n\nOne sign that this breathing discomfort wasn\u2019t all in their heads is that the\nair hunger group had stronger markers of \u201ccritical inspiratory constraints\u201d\n(CIC)\u2014that is, limitations on their ability to breathe more deeply. When your\nbody detects that carbon dioxide levels in your blood are rising, it\nautomatically triggers deeper breathing to flush out the carbon dioxide and\nget more oxygen in. But if you have CIC, you\u2019re at a point where it\u2019s hard to\ninflate your lungs any further, so there\u2019s a mismatch between your desire to\ninhale and your ability to do so. Sure enough, the people in the air hunger\ngroup had several indicators of more severe CIC. For example, they had a\nsmaller peak inspiratory capacity (the maximum volume of air they could\ninhale), and a smaller increase of inspiratory capacity during exercise.\n\nThe next question is what determines who suffers from air hunger and CIC. One\ndifference between the groups is that those with air hunger had, on average,\nhigher VO2 max by 1.5 percent, and reached a higher peak power output by 3.4\npercent. They were also breathing faster at exhaustion (50 breaths per minute\ncompared to 47) and sucking in more air (120 liters per minute compared to\n116). \u201cContrary to popular belief,\u201d Guenette points out, \u201cexercise training\ndoesn\u2019t improve lung capacity.\u201d So one version of the story is that fitter\npeople can push themselves harder for longer, but their lungs aren\u2019t equipped\nto handle the higher load, so they\u2019re more likely to approach their breathing\nlimits.\n\nOn the other hand, while the differences in VO2 max are statistically\nsignificant, they\u2019re pretty subtle. Could there be other factors that dictate\nwho suffers from the feeling of air hunger\u2014something in the structure of the\nlungs or the strength of respiratory muscles? Is it a function of how the\nbrain and central nervous systems respond to a given level of oxygen and\ncarbon dioxide in the blood? None of this is clear yet, and neither is the\ncrucial question of whether there\u2019s anything you can do about it. There\u2019s been\na lot of research over the years about the idea of training your breathing\nmuscles (including some by Guenette), and one of the theories is that any\nperformance benefits are more about changing your subjective response to the\nfeeling of breathlessness rather than actually delivering more oxygen to your\nmuscles. That might be one way of combating the feeling air hunger; another\npossibility is the asthma medication salbutamol, which Guenette hopes to study\nfurther.\n\n## New Data, New Approaches\n\nFor now, what I take from this study is that I need to rethink one of my\nstandard pieces of advice to beginner runners. Feeling out of breath is one of\nthe dominant sensations when you first start running, but I\u2019ve always assured\npeople that it\u2019s a feeling you get used to, and not something that really\nlimits your performance. It turns that, for at least some people, that\u2019s not\ntrue. My sense is that the recent hype about \u201cbetter breathing\u201d has far\noutpaced the evidence, but it\u2019s clear that we still have a lot to learn.\n\nFor more Sweat Science, join me on Threads and Facebook, sign up for the email\nnewsletter, and check out my book Endure: Mind, Body, and the Curiously\nElastic Limits of Human Performance.\n\nFiled to:\n\n  * Athletes\n  * Endurance Training\n  * Running\n  * Science\n\nLead Photo: Kathrin Ziegler/Getty Images\n\n### Popular on Outside Online\n\n## Join Outside+\n\nEnjoy coverage of racing, history, food, culture, travel, and tech with access\nto unlimited digital content from Outside Network's iconic brands.\n\nLearn More\n\n### Healthy Living\n\n  * Clean Eating\n  * Oxygen\n  * Vegetarian Times\n  * Yoga Journal\n\n### Outdoor\n\n  * Backpacker\n  * Climbing\n  * Fly Fishing Film Tour\n  * Gaia GPS\n  * National Park Trips\n  * Outside\n  * Outside TV\n  * SKI\n  * Warren Miller\n\n### Endurance\n\n  * Beta MTB\n  * Fastest Known Time\n  * Pinkbike\n  * Trailforks\n  * Trail Runner\n  * Triathlete\n  * Velo\n  * Women's Running\n\n### Industry\n\n  * athleteReg\n  * Bicycle Retailer & Industry News\n  * FinisherPix\n  * Nastar\n  * Outside Events Cycling Series\n  * Outside Shop\n\n\u00a9 2024 Outside Interactive, Inc\n\n", "frontpage": false}
