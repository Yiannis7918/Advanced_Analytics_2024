There are many among them whose support is fake, a\nmask worn out of a necessity to survive.\n\nIn the past, the Iranians have tried several times to overthrow the government\nthemselves but failed due to the murderous brutality of the regime.\n\nThe regime is weak. It is a paper tiger that has no legitimacy from the\npeople. The ayatollah rules only through boundless brutality.\n\nThe regime can be overthrown, but for this we need help from the outside.\n\nIranian President Ebrahim Raisi visits the military equipment of IRGC Navy in\nBandar Abbas, Iran, February 2, 2024. (credit: IRAN'S PRESIDENCY/WANA (WEST\nASIA NEWS AGENCY)/HANDOUT VIA REUTERS)\n\nFirst, the international community must understand that there is no choice \u2013\nthat the overthrow of the regime must be achieved. Regional and global peace\nand security depend on it.\n\nWhat is Outbrain\n\n### The Islamic Republic of Iran is a real existential threat\n\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran is a real existential threat to Israel, to the\nregion, to Europe, to the United States and to the entire West.\n\nWe dare not underestimate this regime.\n\nThey have an ideology, patience, determination, orderly plan and large budget.\nThose who have the impression that the country or its people are poor should\nunderstand that it isn\u2019t because the regime has no money. It simply does not\nshare the country\u2019s wealth with the people. The regime invests all the money\nin developing its power, in weapons, in violence, because that\u2019s the only way\nit can survive and realize its fanatic ideology.\n\nThe regime is working to break up the West from within. They use democracy to\nfight democracies.\n\nThey radicalize the youth in the United States and Europe, finance media and\npropaganda, and support universities, in cooperation with Qatar, and with the\nsupport of Russia and China.\n\nJust a few days ago, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said in his meeting with\nHamas leader Ismail Haniyeh that their propaganda war is succeeding, and\nsubsequently released a tweet, declaring: \u201cWar also takes place within the\nmedia, whoever has the strongest media in their hands will succeed in\nachieving the goals they seek.\u201d\n\nThe message of the Iranian people to the various regional threats by Iran\u2019s\nmany violent proxies is to not waste time and energy on the octopus\u2019s\ntentacles. If the head is not destroyed, it will continue to grow more\ntentacles, even if one is eliminated, in the Middle East and all over the\nworld.\n\nThe focus must be on the head.\n\nWhat is Outbrain\n\nFinally, this week, Israel took the first serious step in this regard.\n\nThe only way to keep attacking is not to be afraid to attack the bases of the\nIRGC, the symbols of the regime, and its leaders. We have a window of\nopportunity, and we dare not miss it.\n\nWhen Iran has nuclear weapons, it will be too late. They will not hesitate to\nuse it. This is neither North Korea nor the Soviet Union. This is a fanatical\nmurderous extremist ideology.\n\nWhen the Iranian people realize that the West is serious about the overthrow\nof the Iranian regime and is ready to go all the way, they will join.\n\nI know this, I know these people.\n\nI am part of them, and from my throat I carry the voice of tens of millions\nwho are afraid.\n\nI\u2019m not afraid to speak my mind.\n\nThis is why I came to Israel to meet with the people and speak in the Knesset\nas well as recently in the US Congress, both at the invitation of the Middle\nEast Forum.\n\nIn the name of the Iranian people, I call for a struggle to the end of the\nregime. Don\u2019t stop, don\u2019t let them get stronger and don\u2019t think they are\ndeterred.\n\nDon\u2019t make the mistake made before October 7, because a mistake or\nmiscalculation of the intentions of Iran will be far worse.\n\nI call on all free countries to support us. Join us, please don\u2019t be afraid,\nand don\u2019t play a double game.\n\nToday is a time of great historical tests, like that of 1938.\n\nIf we give up and appease Iran and Qatar, like Chamberlain tried to appease\nNazi Germany, we could be dragged into another world war. Only this time it\nwill be much more bloody.\n\nThis is the moment. Don\u2019t hesitate.\n\nTogether, we will win!\n\nThe writer is a prominent Iranian opposition leader based in London, and a\nformer political prisoner in Iran.\n\nRelated TagsIranQatarArab worldIRGCIsrael-Hamas War 2024\n\nTake Israel home with the new Jerusalem Post Store\n\nShop now >>\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\nWhat is Outbrain\n\nWhat is Outbrain\n\nHot Opinion\n\n### A grim fate and raw wounds\n\nBy JPOST EDITORIAL\n\n### Following failure in withholding Hamas, now is Doha's chance to rebrand\n\nBy OHAD MERLIN\n\n### The psychology of soldiers and accidents in the Hamas war\n\nBy RENEE GARFINKEL\n\n### Yellow nail polish: Remembering the Gaza hostages and Hamas's victims\n\nBy BARBARA SOFER\n\n### Memories: A 10-minute conversation with former Israeli Prime Minister\nMenachem Begin\n\nBy DVORA WAYSMANMost Read\n\n1\n\n### Strategic blow: Alleged Israeli airstrike takes out Iranian general in\nDamascus\n\n2\n\n### 'Preparing strikes on Israeli embassies': The coming Iranian response to\nSyria strike\n\n3\n\n### This is everything we know so far about Kate Middleton's cancer\n\n4\n\n### Donald Trump: 'If I don't get elected, it's going to be a bloodbath for\nthe country!'\n\n5\n\n### Russian warships enter the Red Sea, navy says\n\nInformationAbout UsContact usFeedbackTerms Of ServicePrivacy PolicySubscriber\nAgreementJPost JobsCancel SubscriptionSitemap\u05e4\u05e8\u05e1\u05d5\u05dd \u05d1\u05d2'\u05e8\u05d5\u05d6\u05dc\u05dd \u05e4\u05d5\u05e1\u05d8Customer\nServiceAdvertise with UsThe Jerusalem Post GroupBreaking NewsWorld NewsIran\nNewsIvritTalk- Free trial lessonThe Jerusalem ReportJerusalem Post Lite\u05d7\u05d3\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea\n\u05de\u05e2\u05e8\u05d9\u05d1Real Estate ListingsHypeSpecial ContentAdvisor50 JewsJP\nStoreBrandBlendTools and servicesJPost PremiumUlpan OnlineJPost NewsletterOur\nMagazinesLearn HebrewRSS feedJPost.com ArchiveDigital LibraryLists of Jewish\nholidaysLaw\u05dc\u05d5\u05d7 \u05d7\u05d2\u05d9\u05dd \u05d5\u05de\u05d5\u05e2\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd 2023\u05d6\u05de\u05e0\u05d9 \u05db\u05e0\u05d9\u05e1\u05ea \u05e9\u05d1\u05eaSites Of InterestPoalim\nOnlineJNF-USAWho is HamasThe Jerusalem Post Customer Service Center can be\ncontacted with any questions or requests: Telephone: *2421 * Extension 4\nJerusalem Post or 03-7619056 Fax: 03-5613699 E-mail: subs@jpost.com The center\nis staffed and provides answers on Sundays through Thursdays between 07:00 AM\nand 14:00 PM and Fridays only handles distribution requests between 7:00 AM\nand 12:30 PM For international customers: The center is staffed and provides\nanswers on Sundays through Thursdays between 7AM and 14PM Israel time Toll\nFree number 1-800-448-9291 Telephone +972-3-761-9056 Fax: 972-3-561-3699\nE-mail: subs@jpost.comCopyright \u00a9 2024 Jpost Inc.
