Examples include health patients\nrefusing X-rays because they believe the radiation will kill them, such as\nSteve Jobs and Bob Marley who both died after refusing radiation treatment for\ntheir cancer.^[1]^[2] Given that overdoses of radiation are harmful, even\ndeadly (i.e. radiation-induced cancer, and acute radiation syndrome) it is\nreasonable to fear high doses of radiation. The term is also used to describe\nthe opposition to the use of nuclear technology (i.e. nuclear power) arising\nfrom concerns disproportionately greater than actual risks would merit.\n\n## Early use[edit]\n\nThe term was used in a paper entitled \"Radio-phobia and radio-mania\" presented\nby Dr Albert Soiland of Los Angeles in 1903.^[3] In the 1920s, the term was\nused to describe people who were afraid of radio broadcasting and receiving\ntechnology.^[4]^[5] In 1931, radiophobia was referred to in The Salt Lake\nTribune as a \"fear of loudspeakers\",^[6] an affliction that Joan Crawford was\nreported as suffering.^[7] The term \"radiophobia\" was also printed in\nAustralian newspapers in the 1930s and 1940s, assuming a similar meaning.^[8]\nThe 1949 poem by Margarent Mercia Baker entitled \"Radiophobia\" laments the\nintrusion of advertising into radio broadcasts.^[9] The term remained in use\nwith its original association with radios and radio broadcasting during the\n1940s^[10] and 1950s.^[11]\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, the Science Service associated the term with fear\nof gamma radiation and the medical use of x-rays.^[12]^[13] A Science Service\narticle published in several American newspapers proposed that \"radiophobia\"\ncould be attributed to the publication of information regarding the \"genetic\nhazards\" of exposure to ionising radiation by the National Academy of Sciences\nin 1956.^[14]\n\nIn a newspaper column published in 1970, Dr Harold Pettit MD wrote:\n\n> \"A healthy respect for the hazards of radiation is desirable. When atomic\n> testing began in the early 1950s, these hazards were grossly exaggerated,\n> producing a new psychological disorder which has been called \"radiophobia\"\n> or \"nuclear neurosis\".^[15]\n\n## Castle Bravo and its influence on public perception[edit]\n\nOn March 1, 1954, the operation Castle Bravo, testing a first-of-its-kind\nexperimental thermonuclear Shrimp device, overshot its predicted TNT\nequivalent yield of 4\u20136 Mt and instead produced 15 Mt. This produced an\nunanticipated amount of Bikini snow or visible particles of nuclear fallout,\nwhich caught in its plume the Japanese fishing boat the Daigo Fukury\u016b Maru or\nLucky Dragon outside the initially predicted ~5 Mt fallout area cordoned off\nfor Castle Bravo. Approximately 2 weeks after the test and fallout exposure,\nthe 23-member fishing crew began to fall ill with acute radiation sickness,\nlargely brought on by beta burns caused by the direct contact their bare hands\nhad scooping the Bikini snow into bags. Kuboyama Aikichi, the boat's chief\nradioman, died 7 months later, on September 23, 1954.^[16]^[17] It was later\nestimated that about a hundred fishing boats were contaminated to some degree\nby fallout from the test. Inhabitants of the Marshall Islands were also\nexposed to fallout, and a number of islands had to be evacuated.^[17]\n\nThis incident, due to the era of secrecy around nuclear weapons, created\nwidespread fear of uncontrolled and unpredictable nuclear weapons, and also of\nradioactively contaminated fish affecting the Japanese food supply. With the\npublication of Joseph Rotblat's findings that the contamination caused by the\nfallout from the Castle Bravo test was nearly a thousand times greater than\nthat stated officially,^[citation needed] outcry in Japan reached such a level\nthat the incident was dubbed by some as \"a second Hiroshima\".^[18] To prevent\nthe subsequent strong anti-nuclear movement from turning into an anti-American\nmovement,^[citation needed] the Japanese and U.S. governments agreed on\ncompensation of 2 million dollars^[citation needed] for the contaminated\nfishery, with the surviving 22 crew men receiving about \u00a52 million\neach^[19]^[20] ($5,556 in 1954, 63,000 in 2024).^[21]\n\nThe surviving crew members, and their family, would later experience prejudice\nand discrimination, as local people thought that radiation was\ncontagious.^[19]\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\nThe Castle Bravo test and the new fears of radioactive fallout inspired a new\ndirection in art and cinema. The Godzilla films, beginning with Ishir\u014d Honda's\nlandmark 1954 film Gojira, are strong metaphors for post-war radiophobia. The\nopening scene of Gojira echoes the story of the Daigo Fukury\u016b Maru, from the\ninitial distant flash of light to survivors being found with radiation burns.\nAlthough he found the special effects unconvincing, Roger Ebert stated that\nthe film was \"an important one\" and \"properly decoded, was the Fahrenheit 9/11\nof its time.\"^[22]\n\nA year after the Castle Bravo test, Akira Kurosawa examined one person's\nunreasoning terror of radiation and nuclear war in his 1955 film I Live in\nFear. At the end of the film, the foundry worker who lives in fear has been\ndeclared incompetent by his family, but the possible partial validity of his\nfears has transferred over to his doctor.\n\nNevil Shute's 1957 novel On the Beach depicts a future just six years later,\nbased on the premise that a nuclear war has released so much radioactive\nfallout that all life in the Northern Hemisphere has been killed. The novel is\nset in Australia, which, along with the rest of the Southern Hemisphere,\nawaits a similar and inevitable fate. Helen Caldicott describes reading the\nnovel in adolescence as 'a formative event' in her becoming part of the anti-\nnuclear movement.^[23]\n\n## Radiophobia and Chernobyl[edit]\n\nIn the former Soviet Union, many patients with negligible radioactive exposure\nafter the Chernobyl disaster displayed extreme anxiety about low level\nradiation exposure;^[24]^[25] they developed many psychosomatic problems, with\nan increase in fatalistic alcoholism also being observed. As Japanese health\nand radiation specialist Shunichi Yamashita noted:^[26]\n\n> We know from Chernobyl that the psychological consequences are enormous.\n> Life expectancy of the evacuees dropped from 65 to 58 years\u2014not\n> [predominately] because of cancer, but because of depression, alcoholism and\n> suicide. Relocation is not easy, the stress is very big. We must not only\n> track those problems, but also treat them. Otherwise people will feel they\n> are just guinea pigs in our research.\n\nThe term \"radiation phobia syndrome\" was introduced in 1987^[27] by L. A.\nIlyin and O. A. Pavlovsky in their report \"Radiological consequences of the\nChernobyl accident in the Soviet Union and measures taken to mitigate their\nimpact\".^[28]\n\nThe author of Chernobyl Poems Lyubov Sirota^[29] wrote in her poem\n\"Radiophobia\":\n\n> Is this only\u2014a fear of radiation?\n>\n> Perhaps rather\u2014a fear of wars? Perhaps\u2014the dread of betrayal,\n>\n> Cowardice, stupidity, lawlessness?\n\nThe term has been criticized by Adolph Kharash, Science Director at the Moscow\nState University:\n\n> It treats the normal impulse to self-protection, natural to everything\n> living, your moral suffering, your anguish and your concern about the fate\n> of your children, relatives and friends, and your own physical suffering and\n> sickness as a result of delirium, of pathological perversion.^[30]\n\nHowever, the psychological phobia of radiation in sufferers may not coincide\nwith an actual life-threatening exposure to an individual or their children.\nRadiophobia refers only to a display of anxiety disproportionate to the actual\nquantity of radiation one is exposed to, with, in many cases, radiation\nexposure values equal to, or not much higher than, what individuals are\nnaturally exposed to every day from background radiation. Anxiety following a\nresponse to an actual life-threatening level of exposure to radiation is not\nconsidered to be radiophobia, nor misplaced anxiety, but a normal, appropriate\nresponse.\n\nMarvin Goldman is an American doctor who provided commentary to newspapers\nclaiming that radiophobia had taken a larger toll than the fallout itself had,\nand that radiophobia was to blame.^[31]\n\n### Chernobyl abortions[edit]\n\nFollowing the accident, journalists mistrusted many medical professionals\n(such as the spokesman from the UK National Radiological Protection Board),\nand in turn encouraged the public to mistrust them.^[32]\n\nThroughout the European continent, in nations where abortion is legal, many\nrequests for induced abortions, of otherwise normal pregnancies, were obtained\nout of fears of radiation from Chernobyl; including an excess number of\nabortions of healthy human fetuses in Denmark in the months following the\naccident.^[33]\n\n> As the increase in radiation in Denmark was so low that almost no increased\n> risk of birth defects was expected, the public debate and anxiety among the\n> pregnant women and their husbands \"caused\" more fetal deaths in Denmark than\n> the accident. This underlines the importance of public debate, the role of\n> the mass media and of the way in which National Health authorities\n> participate in this debate.\n\nIn Greece, following the accident there were panic and false rumors which led\nto many obstetricians initially thinking it prudent to interrupt otherwise\nwanted pregnancies and/or were unable to resist requests from worried pregnant\nmothers over fears of radiation; within a few weeks misconceptions within the\nmedical profession were largely cleared up, although worries persisted in the\ngeneral population. Although it was determined that the effective dose to\nGreeks would not exceed 1 mSv (0.1 rem), a dose much lower than that which\ncould induce embryonic abnormalities or other non-stochastic effects, there\nwas an observed 2500 excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated,\nprobably out of fear in the mother of some kind of perceived radiation\nrisk.^[34]\n\nA \"slightly\" above the expected number of induced abortions by request\noccurred in Italy, where, upon initial request, \"a week of reflection\"\nfollowed by a 2 to 3 week \"health system\" delay usually occur before the\nprocedure.^[35]^[36]\n\n## Radiophobia and health effects[edit]\n\n> \"My former colleague, William Clark, has likened the public\u2019s frenzy over\n> small environmental insults to the fear of witches in the later Middle Ages.\n> Some million certified \u201cwitches\u201d were executed because they could not prove\n> that they had not caused harm to someone or something. In the same way,\n> since one cannot prove that tiny amounts of radiation did not cause a\n> particular leukemia\u2014for that matter one cannot prove that they caused it\n> either\u2014those who wish to succumb to low-level phobia succumb. As a result\n> nuclear energy [...is] under siege. Not until the low\u2013level controversy is\n> resolved can we expect nuclear energy to be fully accepted.\"\n\n\u2014 Alvin M. Weinberg^[37]\n\nThe term \"radiophobia\" is also sometimes used in the arguments against\nproponents of the conservative LNT concept (Linear no-threshold response model\nfor ionizing radiation) of radiation security proposed by the U.S. National\nCouncil on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) in 1949. The \"no-\nthreshold\" position effectively assumes, from data extrapolated from the\natomic bombings on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, that even negligible doses of\nradiation increase one's risk of cancer linearly as the exposure increases\nfrom a value of 0 up to high dose rates. The LNT model therefore suggests that\nradiation exposure from naturally occurring background radiation may be\nharmful.^[38] There is no biological evidence and weak statistical evidence\nthat doses below 100 mSv have any biological effect.^[39]\n\nAfter the Fukushima disaster, the German news magazine Der Spiegel reported\nthat Japanese residents were suffering from radiophobia.^[26] British medical\nscientist Geraldine Thomas has also attributed suffering of the Japanese to\nradiophobia in interviews and formal presentations.^[40] Four years after the\nevent The New York Times reported that \u2032\u2032about 1,600 people died from the\nstress of the evacuation\u2032\u2032. The forced evacuation of 154,000 people \u2032\u2032was not\njustified by the relatively moderate radiation levels\u2032\u2032, but was ordered\nbecause \u2032\u2032the government basically panicked\u2032\u2032.^[41]\n\nAt the same time as part of the public fears radiation, some commercial\nproducts are also promoted on the basis of their radioactive content, such as\n\"negative ion\" bracelets or radon spas.\n\nMain article: Radioactive quackery\n\n## Radiophobia and industrial and healthcare use[edit]\n\nRadiation, most commonly in the form of X-rays, is used frequently in society\nin order to produce positive outcomes. The primary uses of radiation in\nhealthcare are in radiographic examination and procedures, and radiotherapy in\nthe treatment of cancerous conditions. Radiophobia can be a fear which\npatients experience before and after either of these procedures;^[42] it is\ntherefore the responsibility of the healthcare professional at the time, often\na Radiographer or Radiation Therapist, to reassure the patients about the\nstochastic and deterministic effects of radiation on human physiology.\nAdvising patients and other irradiated persons of the various radiation\nprotection measures that are enforced, including the use of lead-rubber\naprons, dosimetry and Automatic Exposure Control (AEC) is a common method of\ninforming and reassuring radiophobia sufferers.\n\nSimilarly, in industrial radiography, there is the possibility of persons\nexperiencing radiophobia when radiophobia sufferers are near industrial\nradiographic equipment.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Electromagnetic hypersensitivity\n  * Atomic Age\n  * Background radiation\n  * Backscatter X-ray\n  * Chernobyl: Consequences of the Catastrophe for People and the Environment\n  * Dirty bomb\n  * Electromagnetic radiation and health\n  * Fear mongering\n  * Nuclear power debate\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Walton, Alice G. \"Steve Jobs' Cancer Treatment Regrets\".
