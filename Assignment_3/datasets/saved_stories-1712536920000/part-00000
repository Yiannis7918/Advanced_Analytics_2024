Bonk is a command-line tool that provides\nsubcommands to modify windows, adjust window properties, change window\ndecorations, and more.\n\nBonk is designed with X11 in mind.\n\n### Requirements\n\nA C compiler, CMake, and libxcb to build Bonk. Running the testing suite\nrequires Python 3, Xephyr, xtrace, and lcov. The following will build Bonk:\n\n    \n    \n    cmake . make sudo make install\n\n### Examples\n\nBonk executes commands based on what is read from the command line. Here's a\nstarter example:\n\n    \n    \n    bonk get-focus lower\n\nThe first command, get-focus, places the current window into the window stack.\nThe second command, lower, moves a window to the very back of the desktop.\nCommands that operate on a window always default to the first window in the\nstack.\n\nHow about making this more interactive?\n\n    \n    \n    bonk pick lower get-title\n\nThe pick command prompts the user to select a window by left-clicking on it.\nSelection can be cancelled by using any other mouse press. Like get-focus,\npick loads a window into the window stack for lower and get-title to operate\non.\n\nWhat about using a specific window instead?\n\n    \n    \n    bonk raise --window 0xdeadbeef get-title\n\nIn this case, a window id is specified by the --window argument to raise. The\n--window argument is accepted by all commands that operate on windows. It is\nimportant to note that specifying a window replaces all other windows in the\nwindow stack.\n\nWhat about finding windows that match a certain criteria?\n\n    \n    \n    bonk select --class firefox\n\nThis will return all visible windows that were created by firefox. To return\nminimized windows, add --all to the criteria.\n\nIt's possible to narrow the search further:\n\n    \n    \n    bonk select --all --class firefox --title Example\n\nThis returns windows created by firefox that have 'Example' in their title.\nThe --all option means to include windows that are currently minimized.\n\nThe above search may return windows that are of no use to the user. How about\nlimiting the search to windows that are only in the taskbar?\n\n    \n    \n    bonk select --clients\n\nMost window managers provide a list of windows that they're managing. Adding\n--clients to search criteria provides a way to only search within that list,\nto prevent turning up windows that are of no interest to the user.\n\n### Window stack\n\nThe window-arg property on a command allows the following:\n\n  * %N: N-th window (first window is %0)\n  * %-N: Select from the end of the stack (last window is %-1)\n  * %@: Select all windows.\n\n    \n    \n    %-1: Last argument %@: All windows\n\n### Testing\n\nExecute ./run-tests.sh to run all tests.\n\n### Command reference\n\nHere are all commands that Bonk supports (output of bonk help).\n\n    \n    \n    Usage: bonk <commands [arguments]> window stack management get-active Use window manager's active window get-focus Use the window that currently has input focus pick Left click to select a window reject Remove windows using criteria select Search for a window using criteria window actions activate Tell window manager to set active window close Attempt to close a window decoration Set MOTIF (titlebar + border) hints focus Give input focus to a window lower Push a window to the back, behind other windows map Reveal a window a window hidden with unmap move-resize Specify an exact size and place for a window raise Pull a window to the front, ahead of other windows state Minimize, maximize, fullscreen, and more unmap Hide a window (does not minimize to taskbar) information get-title Get title of a window properties prop-adjust Update a simple property (class, instance, etc.) prop-delete Remove a property from a window (use with caution)\n\n## About\n\nX11 window management toolkit\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\n### License\n\nGPL-2.0 license\n\nActivity\n\n### Stars\n\n8 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n2 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n1 fork\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases\n\nNo releases published\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Languages\n\n  * C 81.5%\n  * Shell 11.4%\n  * Python 5.7%\n  * CMake 1.4%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
