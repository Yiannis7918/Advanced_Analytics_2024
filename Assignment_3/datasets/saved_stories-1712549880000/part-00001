In 3 days I converted my petrol car to electric using\nwhat I think is the strangest yet simplest EV conversion technique. In this\nvideo, I'm going to walk you through how I converted the car, and show you all\nthe modifications I made to the engine using a toy model. This technique gives\nthe car power steering and air conditioning without any additional motors!\nLeaving in half the engine saves you the time, money and effort it would take\nto pull out the engine and machine out motor mounts and brackets. The\nconverted car uses a single 6kW, 72V BLDC motor connected to a 350A Kelly\nController. In the trunk, you will find the 72V 100Ah Lithium Ferrophosphate\n(LFP) battery. To retain power braking, I did have to add an electric brake\nbooster vacuum pump to the car, to provide the brake booster with the vacuum\nit needs to assist you during braking. Also, since we don't have an alternator\nin the car anymore, I used a 72-12V DC-DC convertor to bring the 72V from the\nLFP battery in the back down to 12V to charge the lead acid battery to power\nthe central locks, power windows, and the car's lights. While the performance\nof a conversion like this would benefit from a larger motor and battery, the\ncurrent specs produce the perfect city car - with a top speed of 60Km/h and a\nrange of 80-90Km - you'll fit right into the Gurgaon traffic! Best of all, the\ncar costs you less than \u20b91/Km to run! I really hope you enjoy this video and\nwould love your thoughts and feedback in the comments! Please feel free to\nreach out to me for any questions you may have - I would love nothing more\nthan to be a part of your switch from dinosaur bones to electric power!
