If legislated, it would ban the hugely popular\nTikTok social media app in the U.S., where it has 150 million users \u2014 unless\nits owner, the Chinese tech company ByteDance, sells off TikTok within six\nmonths to a buyer not \u201ccontrolled\u201d by a \u201cforeign adversary.\u201d The U.S. Senate\ncould take up the TikTok bill soon, and President Joe Biden has said he\u2019ll\nsign it into law.\n\nWhile U.S. geopolitical and economic competition with China is the underlying\ndriver of the ongoing attacks on TikTok, another factor has emerged: its role\nin spreading news about the plight of Palestinians amid Israel\u2019s monthslong\nassault on Gaza that has killed over 33,000 people and wounded over 76,000.\nKey backers of the TikTok ban have, with little evidence, openly criticized\nthe app for being \u201canti-Israel.\u201d\n\nTruthout spoke to several tech experts and Palestinian organizers about the\nTikTok bill. They stressed that social media platforms have offered\nPalestinians the ability to document and share their stories with mass\naudiences across the world. For younger people in particular who sympathize\nwith Palestinians, apps like TikTok have been ways to gather news and spread\ninformation. All this comes even as social media platforms \u2014 TikTok included \u2014\nhave been accused of flagging and repressing pro-Palestinian content.\n\n\u201cFor so long, a Palestinian narrative has been censored in the mainstream\nmedia,\u201d says Sandra Tamari, a Palestinian organizer and the executive director\nof Adalah Justice Project, a Palestinian-led advocacy organization based in\nthe U.S. Now, amid horrific violence, \u201cit\u2019s Palestinians in Gaza narrating\ntheir story.\u201d\n\n### Related Story\n\nNews\n\n|\n\nPolitics & Elections\n\n## Ocasio-Cortez: A TikTok Ban Wouldn\u2019t Solve Data Privacy Risks Posed by Big\nTech\n\nProgressives have been pointing out that conservative arguments against TikTok\noften boil down to Sinophobia.\n\nBy\n\n    Sharon Zhang ,\n    Truthout\n\nMarch 27, 2023\n\nTruthout\n\n## The Forces Behind the TikTok Ban\n\nThe effort to ban TikTok in the U.S. is not new. Former President Donald\nTrump, amid years of anti-Chinese racist baiting, issued an executive order in\nAugust 2020 to ban \u201cany transaction by any person\u201d in the U.S. with TikTok\nowner ByteDance. The order invoked the \u201cspread in the United States of mobile\napplications developed and owned by companies in the People\u2019s Republic of\nChina\u201d as a \u201cnational emergency.\u201d Ultimately, a federal judge blocked Trump\u2019s\nTikTok ban in December 2020.\n\nParis Marx, author and host of the popular \u201cTech Won\u2019t Save Us\u201d podcast, told\nTruthout that U.S. efforts for global dominance over China in the tech sector\nare driving the attacks on TikTok as well as other measures, including\nblocking Huawei telecom technologies and restricting Chinese access to U.S.\nchip technology.\n\nAll this amounts to \u201ca broader approach by the U.S. government to try to\nrestrict the Chinese tech sector\u201d and \u201creduce its access to international\nmarkets and ability to compete with U.S. tech companies,\u201d says Marx. The\nTikTok ban, says Marx, is part of a broader effort to protect U.S.\ncorporations against \u201cChinese competitors that, in some cases, are matching or\neven out-innovating some of the things that American tech companies are\ndoing.\u201d\n\nMarx says alarmist narratives about China accessing Americans\u2019 user data\nthrough TikTok or the Chinese Communist Party manipulating algorithms are\n\u201cbased on falsehoods or are inaccurate,\u201d with \u201cvery little reporting to\nsuggest any of that is true.\u201d The spread of pro-Palestinian content on TikTok,\nsays Marx, is now being used \u201cas a justification to keep pushing this agenda\nforward.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this idea that exists in the minds of some American lawmakers that\nChina is puppeteering the algorithms and showing people content that goes\nagainst American interests,\u201d Marx said.\n\nIn recent months, numerous politicians and Zionist groups have expressed alarm\nover TikTok, alleging that it has an anti-Israel bias and conflating that with\nantisemitism. Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-New Jersey), cosponsor of the TikTok\nbill, posted on social media that \u201cChina-owned TikTok has been pushing\nantisemitic, anti-Israel, anti-American, and pro-Hamas content\u201d and \u201cis a\npropaganda machine to influence Americans.\u201d Other members of Congress \u2014 such\nas Josh Hawley (R-Missouri), Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Illinois), Ritchie Torres\n(D-New York), Marco Rubio (R-Florida) and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tennessee) \u2014\nhave made similar statements supporting the TikTok ban.\n\nIn claiming that TikTok is fueling \u201canti-Israel\u201d and \u201cpro-Hamas\u201d content,\nelected officials are aligned with major Zionist organizations. Last fall,\nJonathan Greenblatt, president of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), was\nrecorded saying, \u201cwe really have a TikTok problem, a Gen-Z problem,\u201d and\ngroups like the Jewish Federations of North America and the Republican Jewish\nCoalition have applauded the TikTok ban.\n\nNotably, some of the most vocal proponents of the TikTok ban \u2014 like\nGottheimer, Torres and Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wisconsin), who sponsored the\nTikTok bill \u2014 are among the top recipients of donations from the American\nIsrael Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), though AIPAC has not made any\nstatements about the TikTok bill.\n\n## \u201cA Site of Struggle\u201d\n\nThe popularity of pro-Palestinian context on TikTok and other social media\nplatforms isn\u2019t explained by the manipulation of technology, Marx said, but\nrather the underlying political reality of opposition to Israel\u2019s assault on\nGaza.\n\n\u201cYoung people have much more empathy and compassion for what is happening in\nPalestine and in Gaza than lawmakers and many people in the media do,\u201d Marx\nsaid, and they\u2019re \u201csharing the stories that are coming out of Gaza across\nsocial media, whether it\u2019s TikTok or [X, formerly known as] Twitter or\nInstagram.\u201d\n\nTamari notes that if antisemitism was a driving concern, backers of the TikTok\nban would focus on X, which studies show is a hotbed of anti-Jewish\nconspiracies. X owner Elon Musk regularly attacks George Soros, a common\ntarget for coded antisemitism by the far right, and Musk\u2019s recent endorsement\nof a clearly antisemitic X post provoked outrage. Notably, the ADL\u2019s\nGreenblatt faced backlash when, just days after the antisemitic post, he\npraised Musk and his decision to ban phrases like \u201cdecolonization\u201d and \u201cfrom\nthe river to the sea\u201d from X.\n\nThe real concern over TikTok, says Tamari, is that it has allowed Palestinian\nvoices to reach a mass audience. \u201cPeople are hearing directly from\nPalestinians, and this is not something that they can censor,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\ndon\u2019t have control over TikTok. It\u2019s not owned by a U.S. company. It\u2019s not\nbeholden to U.S. interests.\u201d\n\nA 2021 study from an MIT computer science professor found that an \u201canti-\nPalestinian bias persisted disproportionately\u201d across 33,000 New York Times\narticles. One scholar found that \u201cless than 2 percent of the nearly 2,500\nopinion pieces that discussed Palestinians since 1970\u201d published in The New\nYork Times \u201cwere actually written by Palestinians.\u201d\n\nTamari notes that Palestinian journalists like Motaz Azaiza, Bisan Owda and\nPlestia Alaqad have broken through traditional media blackouts with their\nsocial media accounts. \u201cThey can turn the camera around and show the\ndevastation,\u201d she said. \u201cThey can talk to people and bring those stories\ndirectly to an American public, without editors that are saying no.\u201d\n\nTamari says Adalah Justice Project\u2019s social media accounts, including TikTok,\nhave grown substantially during Israel\u2019s war on Gaza. \u201cWe think that\u2019s a very\nimportant site of struggle for narrative,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are hungry for\nnews and hungry to understand the context of why we\u2019re here.\u201d\n\nIman Abid-Thompson, director of advocacy and organizing at U.S. Campaign for\nPalestinian Rights, which provides resources and strategic support to the\nU.S.-based Palestine solidarity movement, says that her organization\nestablished a TikTok account a few months ago, particularly to reach younger\npeople.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t talk about TikTok without talking about Gen Z,\u201d said Abid-Thompson.\n\u201cYounger people have turned to TikTok in a new way over the last couple of\nyears, and we wanted to ensure that we, as an organization, had a voice\nthere.\u201d The Pew Research Center reports that 32 percent of U.S. adults from 18\nto 29 years old \u201cregularly get news from TikTok.\u201d\n\nAbid-Thompson says that \u201cthe issue of Palestine is really prominent\u201d among Gen\nZ, which is now using TikTok and other social media to highlight and oppose\nthe genocide in Gaza. Polls show criticism of Israel and sympathy with\nPalestinians steadily increased among younger people well before the current\nwar in Gaza.\n\n## \u201cA Double-Edged Sword\u201d\n\nHowever, even as pro-Palestinian content breaks through to a mass audience\nover TikTok, Abid-Thompson stresses that the social media is a \u201cdouble-edged\nsword,\u201d with repression, censorship and surveillance of pro-Palestinian voices\nand content. \u201cTikTok is a really great platform for folks to share their\ninsights and perspectives on, but people have been repressed on it for using\nhashtag Gaza or hashtag Rafah,\u201d she said. \u201cWe saw the same thing happen on\nInstagram and [X].\u201d\n\nA December 2023 Human Rights Watch report notes, \u201cMeta\u2019s policies and\npractices have been silencing voices in support of Palestine and Palestinian\nhuman rights\u201d during the war on Gaza, and the group documented \u201cover 1,050\ntakedowns and other suppression of content\u201d on Instagram and Facebook. Another\nFebruary 2024 report also found that \u201cPalestinian and pro-Palestinian voices\nhave been censored and suppressed across Meta\u2019s platforms.\u201d\n\nReporting from Al Jazeera and Vice has suggested that censorship and flagging\nof pro-Palestinian content also occurs on TikTok. Abid-Thompson says she\nposted a TikTok video with an image of a man carrying his dead son that was\nflagged for violence. \u201cYou have Israeli soldiers who post images of themselves\nin demolished homes, and they\u2019re holding up lingerie of people that they\u2019ve\nkilled, and those images never get flagged for TikTok,\u201d she said. \u201cYet on the\nother hand, we\u2019re trying to post images of bulldozed homes or massacres or\ngenocide, and our videos are getting flagged.\u201d\n\nA February 2024 New York Times investigation documented videos posted on\nsocial media by Israeli soldiers that show them \u201cvandalizing local shops and\nschool classrooms, making derogatory comments about Palestinians, bulldozing\nwhat appear to be civilian areas and calling for the building of Israeli\nsettlements in Gaza.\u201d TikTok only removed such videos after the Times\ncontacted them; Meta, owner of Facebook and Instagram, did not respond.\n\nStudies also show that social media platforms ignore Islamophobic content. A\n2022 report by the Center for Countering Digital Hate found that \u201cFacebook,\nInstagram, TikTok, Twitter, and YouTube collectively fail to act on 89% of\nposts containing anti-Muslim hatred and Islamophobia\u201d even after these were\nreported to moderators.\n\nDespite challenges, Tamari stresses the importance of continuing to post about\nwhat\u2019s happening in Palestine. \u201cWe\u2019re nearly six months into this genocide,\nand we should use every tool that we have,\u201d says Tamari. \u201cContinue to post and\ncontinue to engage with posts that raise the issues that are facing the people\nof Gaza. We can\u2019t be deterred.\u201d\n\nUltimately, says Abid-Thompson, the TikTok ban is an intentional derailment\nand distraction from the conversation we really need to be focusing on:\nachieving a permanent and total ceasefire and an end to the genocide in\nPalestine.\n\n##### Tired of reading the same old news from the same old sources?\n\nSo are we!
