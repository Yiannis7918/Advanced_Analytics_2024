(Credit: Getty Images)\n\nFinding a long-term partner is trickier than ever, argues Paul C Brunson,\nauthor of the book Find Love. David Robson asks him how cultural and\ntechnological shifts are changing our relationships.\n\nTechnology offers us many new opportunities for meeting romantic or sexual\npartners, but has this altered our overall attitudes to dating and\nrelationships?\n\nTo find out, science writer David Robson spoke to Paul C Brunson, a global\nrelationships insight expert for Tinder and author of the new book Find Love:\nHow to Navigate Modern Love and Discover the Right Partner for You.\n\nIs it true that finding a partner is harder now than ever before?\n\nFinding a partner has always been a very important decision, but based on the\nresearch for this book, I do believe that finding and keeping love today is\nharder than any point in human history. One reason is that today, we have more\nvariations of what is considered an acceptable relationship. You can be\nmonogamous or in a polyamorous relationship, living together or living apart \u2013\nthere are dozens and dozens of acceptable forms. And that makes finding the\npartner to match your end goal more challenging.\n\nSecondly, we demand more from our partner than ever before. Formerly, it was\nthe person to help protect or raise the child, or to tend the farm. Then, as\nyou move through the ages, it became someone who would be a companion. But now\n\u2013 as [psychologist] Eli Finkel discusses in his research \u2013 we've reached a\npoint of \"self-evolution\", where we are searching for everything out of our\npartner. We want them to be our intellectual equal, we want them to be the CEO\nof the business that we launch, we want them to be a great co-parent, we want\nthem to be a phenomenal sex partner.\n\nHow about technology? Some people seem to feel overwhelmed by the\nopportunities of meeting new people.\n\nWe fool ourselves into the paradox of choice. We believe that we have endless\noptions. But in actuality, if you downloaded 100 dating apps, how many actual\ndates could you get that week? It's limited, so we don't have as many choices\nas we believe.\n\nGetty Images\n\nTinder researcher Paul C Brunson says people may be seeking too much from a\nsingle partner (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nIn your book, you describe another apparent paradox: the fact that on average,\npeople are less happy with their relationships, but the top 20% \u2013 those who\nare the most happy with their partners \u2013 are even more content than they had\nbeen. How do you explain that?\n\nMany marriages now have low satisfaction, and there's a variety of reasons.\nFor example, we are aware that there's more choice and believe the grass is\ngreener, and we also have more knowledge. You can take an assessment of\nattachment style online, for example, and figure out whether or not you or\nyour partner are paired in a strong way.\n\nThat could create doubts about the relationship?\n\nRight, a lot of people are disgruntled. But some people are using these tools\nto their advantage. They are trying to figure out the void in their\nrelationship, so they can make it better. They are inspiring each other to\nwork on their wellbeing. This means there is a smaller percentage of people\nwith high satisfaction, and a large percentage with, unfortunately, lower\nsatisfaction.\n\nYou mentioned attachment styles. How do they reflect our childhood experiences\nwith our caregivers, and how do they influence our adult relationships?\n\nYou have secure attachment, which is essentially someone who, when their\ncaregiver was absent, felt secure and were able to self-soothe. They knew\ntheir caregiver would come back. Then you have the anxious attachment style:\nif the caregiver left the room and came back, they would have a hard time\nrestabilising, because they're anxious that the caregiver could leave again.\nThere's the avoidant attachment style: if the caregiver left the room and came\nback, the child doesn't care, because they believe that the caregiver doesn't\nreally care about them, and so they can only rely on themselves. The fourth\ncategory is \"disorganised\", which is a combination of avoidant and anxious.\n\nThe way that we attached as children is often how we attach as adults to our\nloved ones. So you can see someone who has an anxious style is always\nconcerned that their partner is going to leave. Someone who has an avoidant\nstyle is not going to be emotionally open to their partner. A secure style is\nessentially going to be healthier.\n\nAttachment styles have become very popular, but it's important to be aware of\nthe cultural differences and the cultural nuances. A child who is considered\nanxious in one area may be considered secure in another, because of how the\nchild is raised differently.\n\nGetty Images\n\nThere are good and bad ways to present yourself on Tinder, according to the\napp's research (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nGiven your work at Tinder, what kinds of errors are people making in their\napproaches to online dating?\n\nThere are several mistakes. One is not doing the work ahead of time to\nidentify the relationship goal. Because there are so many types of variations.\nWe've now built a feature into Tinder that allows you to select your\nrelationship goal. Because, if you're looking for a long-term partner, but I'm\nlooking for a short-term partner, and we enter a relationship, it's going to\nbe disastrous.\n\nAll of us think we look like we did 10 years ago, but we don't \u2013 Paul C\nBrunson\n\nAnother big problem is that the photos are atrocious. People don't have recent\nphotos, so when they show up on the date, they look nothing like the picture.\nIt can seem like they are intentionally catfishing \u2013 but they're not. You\nknow, when I joined Tinder two years ago, I had to open an account to see what\nit was all about, and I loaded a photo that was probably 12 years old. Now the\nperson [I was working with] at Tinder said Paul, you don't look like that. All\nof us think we look like we did 10 years ago, but we don't. You should have\nthree to five photos \u2013 one that shows a genuine smile, one that shows your\nfull body, and some photos of you doing something that you're passionate\nabout.\n\nLast but not least, include some \"beige flags\" on your profile. These are the\nthings that people may perceive as quirky, but you own it. One beige flag that\nI might [personally] give is that every month I play Dungeons and Dragons. A\nlot of people might make generalisations, and turn away. But then there would\nbe another group that will be interested. And the fact that I have included my\nbeige flag shows how much self-esteem I have, because I'm putting it out\nthere.\n\nAre there any big generational differences in dating?\n\nWe have to understand that Gen Z in your city or country may be different from\nthe Gen Z population in another city or country, but there are generational\ndifferences. And one of the things I love is that they value authenticity. In\nour research at Tinder, we found that the number one determinant as to whether\nor not they wanted a second date was whether they felt comfortable being\nthemselves with their partner, whereas in all previous generations, physical\nattraction was number one. Now, physical attraction was still number two [for\nGen Z], but we're making strides.\n\nCorrection: This article has been updated to reflect Brunson's relationship\nwith Tinder.
