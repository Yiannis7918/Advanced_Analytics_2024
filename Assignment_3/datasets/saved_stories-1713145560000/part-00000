The field of medical technology, or\nMedTech, is currently undergoing such a process as AI, machine learning, and\nan array of new sensors including computer vision technologies combine to\ncreate an entirely new movement \u2013 TechMed \u2013 that promises to drive better\npatient outcomes globally.\n\nTraditional MedTech is a $500-billion-a-year industry focused primarily on\nmedical devices. It is a hardware-centric field providing an enormous profit\nsanctuary for legacy players, even when the devices are effectively high-\nquality commodities. Indeed, the motivation is focused on consumption of\nmaterials around the device. This is especially true in an array of\northopedic, spine, and cranial surgical areas, which represent over $100\nbillion of annual spend. In these procedures, items such as titanium screws\nand rods that are priced at thousands of dollars are inserted into the patient\nto correct a deformity or broken bone. Glibly, the orthopedic market resembles\nthe shaving market: many large MedTech companies such as Medtronic and Stryker\nmake more on the plates, rods, and screws (blades) than the devices to\ninternally fixate them (razors).\n\nUnlike MedTech, the emerging TechMed industry starts from a fundamentally\ndifferent base, leveraging cutting-edge technological capabilities like data\nvisualization, real-time sensors and sensor fusion, computer vision systems,\nGPU-accelerated computing power, and machine learning models trained on large,\nproprietary data sets. These deep-tech competencies are then adapted and\napplied to various medical and surgical use cases. Because TechMed is being\nbuilt in the modern AI era, it can take full advantage of technologies like\nneural networks, convolutional deep learning, and other advanced methods to\nparse through and derive insights from the massive troves of medical data\nbeing generated.\n\nRather than developing new medical devices per se, TechMed companies are\nfocused on creating intelligent software systems that can augment and optimize\nthe human technique involved in the practice of medicine itself. Their AI \u201cco-\npilots\u201d can guide physicians on how diagnostic exams or procedures should be\nproperly performed, automatically read and interpret medical images like MRIs\nor CT scans, recommend optimal surgical plans, and even provide real-time\nsurgical navigation and decision support.\n\nIn effect, TechMed companies cultivate a \u201cdata river\u201d rather than a data moat,\na continuous and dynamic flow of data that spans the entire patient lifecycle,\nfrom diagnostics to intra-procedures, and post-procedure phases. The depth,\nbreadth, and constant updating of these datasets ensure they remain\ncomprehensive and relevant, with each new data input enhancing the model\u2019s\ncapabilities. This contrasts with traditionally \u201csiloed\u201d institutional data\nstores that are fragmented, narrow in scope, and quickly become stale.\n\nThe economics and business-model implications of the TechMed movement more\nclosely mirror the dynamics we see from dominant tech platforms and\necosystems. Whereas MedTech players are primarily product companies that\nmonetize device sales, TechMed companies are fundamentally software- and\nplatform-centric.\n\nIn this sense, an analogy can be drawn to Microsoft\u2019s evolution from its\nWindows operating system as the base layer enabling an entire ecosystem of\ncomplementary applications, services, and hardware offerings. The first\n\u201coperating systems\u201d for TechMed \u2013 connected data platforms ingesting multi-\nmodal inputs from the clinic and hospital environment \u2013 will similarly yield a\ndiverse array of smart, AI-guided applications tailored for different medical\nspecialties and use cases. This creates an opportunity for TechMed companies\nto develop into multibillion-dollar, all-encompassing platforms monetizing at\na much greater scale than the product silos of the legacy medical industry.\n\nFor investors and entrepreneurs, TechMed represents a potential departure from\nthe traditional \u201ccookie cutter\u201d MedTech business model of splitting up the\nhuman body into discrete component verticals like ortho, cardio, neuro, etc.\nRather than having to hyper-specialize in inherently limited markets, TechMed\nenables building horizontal platforms that can scale across multiple\ntherapeutic areas and use cases.\n\nProprio and Caption Health: Poster Children for TechMed\n\nTwo DCVC-backed companies exemplifying the TechMed thesis are Proprio and\nCaption Health. Proprio is a surgical navigation and intelligence company\nfocused initially on spine procedures like posterior spinal fusions to correct\ncurvature of the spine. It relies on an advanced array of sensor technologies\nincluding lightfield imaging, which captures visuals with far more depth and\ndimensionality than traditional cameras.\n\nProprio\u2019s system gives surgeons real-time 3D guidance akin to \u201csurgical GPS,\u201d\ncontinuously mapping and adjusting the operative field to ensure optimal\nimplant placement and spinal alignment. It leverages computer-vision AI models\nbuilt from analyzing hundreds of prior procedures by world-class surgeons\nacross 250+ gigabytes of multi-modal operating-room data per procedure. This\nproprietary data pipeline allows Proprio\u2019s system to improve with every\nsurgery, learning new techniques and adjusting for any intraoperative changes.\n\nIn 2023, Proprio secured its landmark FDA 510(k) clearance as the first such\nAI-guided surgical navigation system for spine surgery. With a robust pipeline\nof further FDA submissions across other spine procedure types and ultimate\nambitions to expand into orthopedics, neurosurgery, and more, Proprio is\npositioned to become the default \u201cco-pilot\u201d platform augmenting surgeons\nacross myriad therapeutic areas.\n\nCaption Health, acquired by GE HealthCare in 2023, took a similar data-driven\nAI approach but for the imaging diagnostic realm. Its breakthrough product was\nan AI guide that enabled minimally trained operators to capture diagnostic-\nquality ultrasound image sequences on par with expert sonographers or\ncardiologists. By studying tens of thousands of prior exams, Caption\u2019s AI\nlearned to identify standard views and provide real-time instructions on\nproperly manipulating the ultrasound wand.\n\nFor conditions like heart disease, which require assessing the heart\u2019s\nejection fraction (the percentage of blood pumped out of the heart with each\ncontraction), Caption\u2019s \u201cvirtual instructor\u201d democratized the ability to\nadminister these studies at the point of care, rather than having to rely on\nscarce, trained staff constantly shuttling between imaging rooms and offices.\nCaption subsequently expanded its product into other use cases like lung\nimaging and maternal health, creating AI-guided imaging protocols for a\nvariety of acute and chronic conditions.\n\nReal-World Impact\n\nThe human and economic impact of the TechMed movement is multifaceted and\ntransformative. Unlike the slower innovation cycles of traditional MedTech\ncompanies, TechMed players like Proprio and Caption more resemble agile tech\nindustry disruptors.\n\nA key driver for TechMed\u2019s rapid innovation is addressing significant labor\nshortages plaguing healthcare systems. In the U.S. alone, there is a shortage\nof tens thousands of surgeons and a million nurses \u2013 gaps that can\u2019t be\nbridged simply by training more professionals. TechMed innovations that make\nprocedures faster and more efficient can mitigate this workforce crunch.\nProprio\u2019s technology, for instance, reduces operating times by 20 to 30\nminutes by optimizing implant placement and workflow. This minimizes patient\nrisk from excessive time under anesthesia while boosting operating room\nthroughput and utilization for healthcare facilities.\n\nMoreover, unlike MedTech and BioTech businesses dependent on a blockbuster\ndevice (pacemaker) or drug (Ozempic), TechMed companies can sustainably grow\nby continuously delivering new AI-guided software applications atop their core\nplatform. This echoes how companies like Cisco successfully monetized and\nexpanded the core Internet protocol suite across myriad complementary\nnetworking services and applications. The ability to nimbly integrate new\ncapabilities creates stickier, more comprehensive solutions than MedTech\u2019s\ntraditionally siloed offerings.\n\nTechMed is poised to create more abundance and better outcomes in healthcare.\nThe shift among health insurers toward value-based reimbursement models tied\nto quality metrics gives these solutions a powerful tailwind. By enhancing\nprecision and consistency, TechMed lowers the variability that today can make\noutcomes dependent on factors like provider expertise or patient\nsocioeconomics. As more aspects of care delivery become data-driven and AI-\nguided, all patients can access a consistently high standard of evidence-based\nmedical practice.\n\nDigitizing human anatomy into quantifiable data models also helps break down\nthe fragmented hyper-specialization that can compromise holistic, patient-\ncentered care. Rather than treatment paths being dictated by specialty silos\nand fragmented data, TechMed enables more integrated care journeys fueled by\ncomprehensive \u201cdata rivers\u201d that span the entire continuum. Robust data and AI\ninscription of medical knowledge boosts accessibility and outcomes, which are\nultimately the crucial determinants of patient satisfaction.\n\nData is becoming the atomic element of healthcare.\n\nLooking ahead, the TechMed movement is poised to continue revolutionizing\nhealthcare. The future will likely see the development of even more\nsophisticated AI-driven feedback loops, enhancing patient care and response\nover time. The accumulation of large, proprietary datasets will facilitate\nthis, enabling a deeper understanding of surgical techniques and outcomes.\nUltimately, TechMed stands at the forefront of a healthcare transformation,\npromising better patient care, more efficient medical practices, and a more\neconomically sustainable healthcare system.\n\nAlan Cohen is a General Partner at DCVC.\n\nShare\n\n##\n\nRelated Companies\n\n### Caption Health\n\nHelping non-specialists deliver echocardiograms in any setting\n\nEXIT - Acquisition (GE HealthCare: GEHC)\n\n### Proprio\n\nThe next generation of surgical navigation technology\n\n##\n\nRelated Content\n\nNews\n\n### Game Changer: Proprio\u2019s First-in-Human Spine Surgery\n\nBy Alan Cohen\n\n16 Oct 2023\n\nNews\n\n### Congratulations to Proprio on its Series B and move into commercialization\n\nBy Alan Cohen\n\n08 Aug 2023\n\nNews\n\n### A 3D Google Maps for Surgeons: Proprio Secures FDA Clearance for Spinal\nSurgical Navigation\n\nBy Alan Cohen\n\n08 May 2023\n\nNews\n\n### GE HealthCare acquires Caption Health, energizing DCVC\u2019s thesis around AI\nin medicine\n\nBy Alan Cohen\n\n09 Feb 2023\n\n  * Companies\n  * About\n  * DCVC Bio\n  * Team\n  * News & Insights\n  * Careers\n\nContent Topics\n\n  * Climate\n  * Computational Bio & Chem\n  * Computational Healthcare\n  * Cybersecurity, Security, & Defense\n  * Enterprise Enablement\n  * Finance & Insurance\n  * Foundational Technology\n  * Industrial Transformation\n  * Smart Agriculture\n  * Space\n\nLocations\n\nPalo Alto 270 University Avenue Palo Alto, CA 94301\n\nSan Francisco 500 2nd Street, Floor 2 San Francisco, CA 94107\n\nMedia Resources\n\nDCVC\n\n\u00a92024 DCVC.
