The automatic text replacement reportedly\napplied to any URL ending in \"twitter.com\" even if it wasn't actually a\ntwitter.com link.\n\nThe change apparently went live on X's app for iOS, but not on the web\nversion. It seems to have been a problem for a day or two before the company\nfixed the automatic text replacement so that it wouldn't affect non-\nTwitter.com domains.\n\nSecurity reporter Brian Krebs called the move \"a gift to phishers\" in an\narticle yesterday. It was a phishing risk because scammers could register a\ndomain name like \"netflitwitter.com,\" which would appear as \"netflix.com\" in\nposts on X, but clicking the link would take a user to netflitwitter.com.\n\n\"A search at DomainTools.com shows at least 60 domain names have been\nregistered over the past two days for domains ending in 'twitter.com,'\nalthough research so far shows the majority of these domains have been\nregistered 'defensively' by private individuals to prevent the domains from\nbeing purchased by scammers,\" Krebs wrote.\n\nEven if the change had been implemented smoothly, auto-replacing \"twitter.com\"\nwith \"x.com\" doesn't do much to help Musk cement his branding shift because\nx.com still redirects to twitter.com.\n\n## Domains ending in \u201cx\u201d could be spoofed\n\nOne of the newly registered domain names inspired by X's text replacement is\nthe example mentioned above. Navigating to netflitwitter.com will show you a\nmessage that says, \"This domain has been acquired to prevent its use for\nmalicious purposes.\" The webpage was set up by X user @yuyu0127_ and goes on\nto say:\n\n> As of April 8, 2024, the iOS Twitter (now X) client automatically replaces\n> the text \"twitter.com\" in posts with \"x.com\" as part of its functionality.\n> Therefore, for example, a URL that appears to be \"netflix.com\" will actually\n> redirect to \"netflitwitter.com\" when clicked.\n>\n> Please be aware that there is a potential for this feature to be exploited\n> in the future, by acquiring domains containing \"twitter.com\" to lead users\n> to malicious pages. This domain, \"netflitwitter.com,\" has been acquired for\n> protective purposes to prevent its use for such malicious activities.\n\nAs another X user (@Arcticstar0) pointed out, \"the actual link is unchanged.\nIt's just the text placeholder that appears different. So the link goes to a\ndifferent url than it appears.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKrebs quoted Sean McNee, VP of research and data at DomainTools, as saying\nthat \"bad actors could register domains as a way to divert traffic from\nlegitimate sites or brands given the opportunity\u2014many such brands in the top\nmillion domains end in x, such as webex, hbomax, xerox, xbox, and more.\"\n\n## First fix attempt reportedly fell short\n\nIn an article on Tuesday, Mashable wrote that X had fixed the problem \"for\nsome of the domains affected by this change\" so that domains like\nnetflitwitter.com no longer appeared as netflix.com. But at the time of that\narticle's publication, Mashable said it was able to \"confirm that the X for\niOS app is currently still changing many other references of 'Twitter.com' to\n'X.com.'\"\n\nX may have the text replacement working as intended now so that it changes the\nappearance of twitter.com links but not other links containing the word\n\"twitter.\"\n\nA post by @Arcticstar0 lists some real Twitter URLs alongside \"space-\ntwitter.com.\" A screenshot in the Mashable article showed that at one point,\nthis post, when displayed on the iOS app, rendered \"space-twitter.com\" as\n\"space-x.com.\" But today, the same post when viewed in the iOS app displays\n\"space-twitter.com\" correctly while rendering the \"twitter.com\" link as\n\"x.com.\"\n\nOf course, clicking that latter link actually takes you to twitter.com. Typing\nx.com into your browser also redirects you to twitter.com because the Twitter-\nto-X transition is woefully incomplete.\n\nToday, when we emailed X's media contact address, press@x.com, we got the\nstandard \"busy now, please check back later\" auto-reply. It came not from an\nx.com email but from press+noreply@twitter.com.\n\n#### reader comments\n\n159\n\nJon Brodkin Jon has been a reporter for Ars Technica since 2011 and covers a\nwide array of telecom and tech policy topics.
