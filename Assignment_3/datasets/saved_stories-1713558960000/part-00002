See\nour ethics statement.\n\nThe Limitless Pendant comes in a bunch of colors and doesn\u2019t really look like\nan AI gadget.\n\nImage: Limitless\n\nThe Limitless Pendant doesn\u2019t exactly scream \u201cAI.\u201d As Dan Siroker, the CEO of\nthe company behind the new device, lifts it up to show me over Zoom, the\nround, rubbery-looking gizmo reminds me more of an old-school clippable\nFitbit. But what Siroker is actually showing me is a device that can be\nclipped onto your shirt or worn on a string around your neck that is meant to\nrecord everything you hear \u2014 and then use AI to help you remember and make\nsense of it.\n\nThe Limitless Pendant is part of the whole Limitless system, which the company\nis launching today. (Oh, and in case you\u2019re wondering: yes, it\u2019s very much a\nreference to the movie.) Siroker\u2019s last AI product, Rewind, was an app that\nran on your computer and would record your screen and other data in order to\nhelp you remember every tab, every song, every meeting, everything you do on\nyour computer. (When the company first teased the Limitless Pendant, it was\nactually called the Rewind Pendant.) Limitless has similar aims, but instead\nof just running on your computer, it\u2019s meant to collect data in the cloud and\nthe real world, too, and make it all available to you on any device. Rewind is\nstill around, for the folks who want the all-local, one-computer approach \u2014\nbut Siroker says the cross-platform opportunity is much bigger.\n\n\u201cThe core job to be done is initially around meetings,\u201d Siroker tells me.\n\u201cPreparing you for meetings, transcribing meetings, giving you real-time notes\nof meetings and summaries of meetings.\u201d For $20 a month, the app will capture\naudio from your computer\u2019s mic and speakers, and you can also give it access\nto your email and calendar. With that combination \u2014 and ultimately all the\nother apps you use for work, Siroker says \u2014 Limitless can do a lot to help you\nkeep track of conversations. What was that new app someone mentioned in the\nboard meeting? What restaurant did Shannon say we should go to next time?\nWhere did I leave off with Jake when we met two weeks ago? In theory,\nLimitless can get that data and use AI models to get it back to you anytime\nyou ask.\n\nSiroker and I are talking the day after the first reviews of the Humane AI Pin\ncame out, and he\u2019s careful to differentiate his company\u2019s approach from these\nall-encompassing AI tools. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to do a few things exceptionally\nwell, not be a mile wide and an inch deep,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re not, you know,\ntrying to reinvent the wheel with lasers.\u201d His plan is to integrate into all\nthe apps you use and put Limitless inside of those apps; you should be able to\ntake notes in Notion or get action items in Slack, he thinks, instead of\nhaving to go to some other app entirely. \u201cWhy would I even have to make you\nlog into my cloud based app, when I could just have you show up to the thing\nyou\u2019re already using?\u201d\n\nIs it just me or does this thing look like a tiny pair of AirPods Max\nheadphones?\n\nImage: Limitless\n\nBut only a few minutes later, Siroker\u2019s ambition gets the best of him, and he\nstarts to imagine a much bigger future for Limitless. (I mean, the thing is\ncalled Limitless \u2014 there\u2019s no \u201cdon\u2019t do too much\u201d faux-humility allowed here.)\n\u201cYou know, of course it\u2019ll do the generic fun facts, Perplexity, OpenAI\nstuff,\u201d he says. \u201cThe next step is proactive, and not reactive. I have access\nto your email, I have access to your Slack messages \u2014 when you get a message\nfor which the context of your past can help answer it, I can just give you\nthat draft.\u201d\n\nOnce Limitless gets that down, he says, it\u2019ll be about AI agents that actually\ndo stuff on your behalf, so Limitless can know everything about you and do\neverything for you and everything will be amazing.\n\nAfter a minute of this, Siroker catches himself. \u201cBut that\u2019s a much harder\nproblem to solve.\u201d For now, meetings.\n\nOn its own, the first version of the Limitless system is not especially\nunusual. Practically every meeting tool is baking in AI features for\nextracting key points and action items; transcription apps are a dime a dozen;\nthere\u2019s a whole industry of startups hoping to get a few bucks a month in\norder to make your meetings a little more efficient. Siroker is confident\nLimitless can do it well, in part because Rewind has been doing it well for a\nwhile, but ultimately meeting AI is probably a feature and not a product.\n\nThe Limitless Pendant, which is shipping in August, is what might change\nthings. The $99 device is meant to be with you all the time \u2014 Siroker says its\nbattery lasts 100 hours \u2014 and uses beam-forming tech to more clearly record\nthe person speaking to you and not the rest of the coffee shop or auditorium.\nAn LED lights up whenever it\u2019s recording, and the Limitless Pendant also has a\n\u201cConsent Mode\u201d that detects new voices and doesn\u2019t record them until the\nsoftware hears them agree to being recorded. (It\u2019s worth noting this mode is\noff by default.) Everything you record gets uploaded to Limitless, mingled\nwith your other data, and made available through the apps.\n\nWhen I ask Siroker why it was worth it to build a device to go along with his\nsoftware, when voice recorders already exist, he says getting good real-world\naudio is key to being more than just an AI for your Zoom calls. He also once\nagain references the Humane AI Pin \u2014 specifically The New York Times\u2019 review\nof the product, which concludes by saying there\u2019s something cool about the\nwearable form factor and hopes for a future iteration of the product, \u201cperhaps\na cheaper one that lacks a camera and a laser.\u201d That future iteration, Siroker\nsays with a laugh, is basically the Limitless Pendant.\n\nMake no mistake: Limitless absolutely intends to be a big-deal AI gadget, as\nfull-featured and powerful as anything from Meta or Rabbit or Humane. But the\nplan is to not lead with cool hardware or some sci-fi vision of a still-\ndistant future. It\u2019s to pick a problem AI can solve, solve it, and then pick\nanother one. Meeting prep may not be the most exciting AI story to tell, but\nit\u2019s one that works. And that\u2019s probably the way to start.\n\nMost Popular\n\nMost Popular\n\n  1. ## The invisible seafaring industry that keeps the internet afloat\n\n  2. ## Meta\u2019s battle with ChatGPT begins now\n\n  3. ## US Air Force confirms first successful AI dogfight\n\n  4. ## Google is combining its Android and hardware teams \u2014 and it\u2019s all about AI\n\n  5. ## The future of the Xbox looks a lot like a PC\n\nFrom our sponsor\n\nAdvertiser Content From\n\n## More from Artificial Intelligence\n\n  * ### Adobe Premiere Pro is getting generative AI video tools \u2014 and hopefully OpenAI\u2019s Sora\n\n  * ### Galaxy AI features are coming to last-gen Samsung phones \u2014 including the S21 series\n\n  * ### The good, the bad, and the Humane Pin\n\n  * ### Find the best AI-powered app to transcribe your audio\n\n  * Advertiser Content From\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Notice\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Info\n  * Licensing FAQ\n  * Accessibility\n  * Platform Status\n  * How We Rate and Review Products\n\n  * Contact\n  * Tip Us\n  * Community Guidelines\n  * About\n  * Ethics Statement\n\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Jobs @ Vox Media\n\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
