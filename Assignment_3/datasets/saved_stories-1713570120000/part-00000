The scheme impacted both\ninvestors trading and the exchange itself, which had to suspend operations\nafter Eisenberg's attack made the exchange insolvent.\n\nNicole M. Argentieri, the principal deputy assistant attorney general who\nheads the DOJ's criminal division, said that Eisenberg's manipulative trading\nscheme \"puts our financial markets and investors at risk.\"\n\n\"This prosecution\u2014the first involving the manipulation of cryptocurrency\nthrough open-market trades\u2014demonstrates the Criminal Division\u2019s commitment to\nprotecting US financial markets and holding wrongdoers accountable, no matter\nwhat mechanism they use to commit manipulation and fraud,\u201d Argentieri said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMango Labs has similarly sued Eisenberg over the price manipulation scheme,\nbut that lawsuit was stayed until the DOJ's case was resolved. Mango Labs is\nexpecting a status update today from the US government and is hoping to\nproceed with its lawsuit.\n\nArs could not immediately reach Mango Labs for comment.\n\nEisenberg's lawyer, Brian Klein, provided the same statement to Ars,\nconfirming that Eisenberg's legal team is \"obviously disappointed\" but \"will\nkeep fighting for our client.\"\n\n## How the Mango Markets scheme worked\n\nMango Labs has accused Eisenberg of being a \"notorious cryptocurrency market\nmanipulator,\" noting in its complaint that he has a \"history of attacking\nmultiple cryptocurrency platforms and manipulating cryptocurrency markets.\"\nThat history includes allegedly embezzling $14 million in 2021 while Eisenberg\nwas working as a developer for another decentralized marketplace called\nFortress, Mango Labs' complaint said.\n\nEisenberg's attack on Mango Markets intended to grab tens of millions more\nthan the alleged Fortress attack. When Eisenberg was first charged, the DOJ\nexplained how his Mango Markets price manipulation scheme worked.\n\nOn Mango Markets, investors can \"purchase and borrow cryptocurrencies and\ncryptocurrency-related financial products,\" including buying and selling\n\"perpetual futures contracts.\"\n\n\"When an investor buys or sells a perpetual for a particular cryptocurrency,\nthe investor is not buying or selling that cryptocurrency but is, instead,\nbuying or selling exposure to future movements in the value of that\ncryptocurrency relative to another cryptocurrency,\" the DOJ explained.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n22\n\nAshley Belanger Ashley is a senior policy reporter for Ars Technica, dedicated\nto tracking social impacts of emerging policies and new technologies.
