Most existing observational studies\nfind that exposure to poor individuals is positively associated with support\nfor redistribution among the well-off, but one prominent field experiment\nfound a negative link. We seek to resolve these divergent findings by\nemploying a design closer to the studies that have found a positive link, but\nwith more causal leverage than these; specifically, a three-wave panel survey\nlinked with fine-grained registry data on local income composition in Denmark.\nIn within-individual models, increased exposure to poor individuals is\nassociated with lower support for redistribution among wealthy individuals. By\ncontrast, between-individual models yield a positive relationship, thus\nindicating that self-selection based on stable individual characteristics\nlikely explains the predominant finding in previous work.\n\n## Keywords\n\neconomic inequalityattitudes toward redistributionneighbourhood effectspanel\ndataadministrative data\n\nType\n\n    Letter\n\nInformation\n\n    \n\nBritish Journal of Political Science , First View , pp. 1 - 11\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007123424000061 [Opens in a new window]\n\nCreative Commons\n\n    \n\nThis is an Open Access article, distributed under the terms of the Creative\nCommons Attribution licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/),\nwhich permits unrestricted re-use, distribution and reproduction, provided the\noriginal article is properly cited.\n\nCopyright\n\n    \n\nCopyright \u00a9 The Author(s), 2024. Published by Cambridge University Press\n\nMotivated by concerns over growing income inequality across developed\ndemocracies (Piketty and Saez Reference Piketty and Saez2014), a large and\ngrowing literature has investigated the relationship between inequality and\nvoters' support for redistribution (Condon and Wichowsky Reference Condon and\nWichowsky2020; Kenworthy and McCall Reference Kenworthy and McCall2008; Lupu\nand Pontusson Reference Lupu and Pontusson2011). The nature of this\nrelationship is crucial because voters can\u2014via their policy preferences that\nanimate politicians to enact policies\u2014contribute to both the amelioration\n(Meltzer and Richard Reference Meltzer and Richard1981) and the aggravation of\neconomic inequality (Kelly and Enns Reference Kelly and Enns2010) depending on\nhow they respond to it.\n\nA significant body of work suggests that the link between income inequality\nand support for redistribution is partly rooted in local experiences. Economic\ndifferences observed in one's local surroundings shape perceptions of economic\ninequality and ultimately influence attitudes toward redistribution (Condon\nand Wichowsky Reference Condon and Wichowsky2020; Newman Reference Newman2020;\nSands Reference Sands2017; Sands and De Kadt Reference Sands and de\nKadt2020).Footnote ^1 However, there is disagreement over the empirical\nevidence.\n\nThe dominant finding in the literature is that residential exposure to higher\nlocal economic inequality in general\u2014and exposure to poorer individuals among\nthe well-off in particular\u2014is associated with more support for redistribution\nand related attitudes (for example, Bailey et al. Reference Bailey, Gannon,\nKearns, Livingston and Leyland2013; Franko and Livingston Reference Franko and\nLivingston2022; Kearns et al. Reference Kearns, Bailey, Gannon, Livingston and\nLeyland2014; Minkoff and Lyons Reference Minkoff and Lyons2019; Newman\nReference Newman2020; see also Franko Reference Franko2016). These findings\nhave been interpreted as being consistent with an extended version of\nintergroup contact theory, which predicts that contact with out-group\nmembers\u2014particularly under facilitating conditions\u2014can generate more positive\nattitudes toward these groups. This applies most straightforwardly to affluent\nindividuals for whom the effect of such contact may extend beyond sympathy for\npoorer individuals to greater support for redistribution benefitting this\ngroup. While cross-income group contact is not the only explanation for the\npositive relationship, we label these studies \u2018contact-supporting\u2019 for\nsimplicity.Footnote ^2\n\nIn sharp contrast to the general finding of a positive relationship between\nrich people's exposure to poorer individuals and their support for\nredistribution, Sands (Reference Sands2017) finds\u2014in a prominent field\nexperiment\u2014that the presence of a noticeable poor-appearing person in affluent\nneighbourhoods in Boston, United States reduce passerby's redistribution\nsupport, gauged by their reduced willingness to sign a petition in support of\na millionaire's tax. This finding is consistent with theories of intergroup\nconflict, which predict that exposure to economic out-groups prompts material\nconflict or evokes negative out-group stereotypes that, in turn, lead to a\nreduced willingness to redistribute among the better-off.Footnote ^3^,\nFootnote ^4 Correspondingly, we label Sands' finding \u2018conflict-supporting\u2019.\n\nThe sharp divergence in their conclusions naturally raises the question of\nwhat may explain the difference between the contact- and conflict-supporting\nstudies. At least two potential explanations lend themselves. The self-\nselection explanation attributes the diverging results to different abilities\nto eliminate bias from the selection of individuals into neighbourhoods in the\ntwo lines of work. Conversely, the single episode vs. repeated exposure\nexplanation reconciles the divergent findings by attributing them to\ndifferences in the temporal extension of the out-group exposure studied as a\nproxy for associated intergroup processes (conflict or contact).\n\nThis paper proposes and tests the two potential explanations for the\nliterature's divergent findings by analyzing the relationship between exposure\nto poor people and support for redistribution among rich individuals in\nDenmark, an economically equal country, comparatively speaking (Solt Reference\nSolt2020). We do so by employing a design closer to the contact-supporting\nstudies (focusing on repeated exposure to poor neighbours, providing the basis\nfor eventual contact) but with more causal leverage than these (a three-wave\nindividual-level panel design linked to fine-grained registry data on local\nincome composition) to study the consequences of temporally extended\nresidential exposure to poor people among the better-off. Our design thus\nallows us to address whether the divergent existing findings are (i) a\nfunction of the strength of causal identification in the design employed or\n(ii) the time horizon of the studied exposure.\n\nTo preview, in within-individual models analyzed using two-way fixed effects,\nwe find that exposure to poor individuals is associated with lower support for\nredistribution among wealthier individuals. Our results resonate with Sands'\n(Reference Sands2017) findings in supporting the conflict perspective on the\nlink between exposure to poor individuals and support for redistribution.\nFurther, we substantiate the self-selection explanation by showing that when\nanalyzed cross-sectionally (in between-individual models), we find a positive\nrelationship between exposure to poor individuals and redistribution support\namong the better-off, thus indicating that self-selection based on stable\nindividual characteristics is a likely explanation for previous \u2018contact-\nsupporting\u2019 findings. Our results thus support the negative effect of exposure\nto poor individuals on the better-off's support for redistribution and point\nto one plausible explanation for why some studies have found the opposite.\n\n## Self-Selection or Different Time Frames? Explaining the Divergent Results\n\nAs noted, two accounts\u2014the self-selection explanation and the single episode\nvs. repeated exposure explanation\u2014may plausibly explain the divergent findings\nin the literature on the relationship between local inequality and support for\nredistribution.\n\nThe self-selection explanation takes its starting point in the fact that\ncontact-supporting studies rely on observational\u2014almost exclusively cross-\nsectional\u2014data, while Sands' (Reference Sands2017) conflict-supporting study\nis based on an experiment. Consequently, one explanation for the different\nfindings is that the positive correlation between inequality and support for\nredistribution observed in the contact-supporting studies reflects confounding\nfrom self-selection. More specifically, rich individuals\u2014who, given their\nfinancial resources, are less constrained in where they live\u2014may partly choose\nneighbourhoods and neighbours based on their predispositions toward the less\nwell-off. Because these predispositions likely correlate with attitudes toward\nredistribution, the contact-supporting evidence may reflect a choice to live\nin certain areas that is correlated with redistribution attitudes. Conversely,\nbecause Sands (2017) randomizes exposure to poor individuals, the observed\nrelationship is free from selection bias. Lastly, if the self-selection\nexplanation is correct, a logical follow-up question is which selection\nprocesses\u2014for example, contemporary experiences or personality traits\u2014explain\nthe difference in the results.\n\nThe single episode vs. repeated exposure explanation attributes the\nliterature's divergent results to the time horizon of the observed\nrelationship between exposure to poor individuals and support for\nredistribution. Rather than siding with either line of work, this explanation\nattributes the divergent findings to the difference between short-term/single-\nshot (conflict-supporting studies) and repeated (contact-supporting studies)\nexposure. More specifically, theory and empirical evidence from other domains,\nespecially immigration, suggest that it is exactly the fleeting exposure to\nout-groups, which Sands studies, that likely prompts adverse reactions to\nthese groups (Allport Reference Allport1954; Enos Reference Enos2017). As\nsuch, and by extension, the reduction in support for redistribution among the\nbetter-off when briefly exposed to poorer individuals aligns perfectly with\nthe broader literature on group conflict. However, whether repeated out-group\nexposure consolidates or moderates the negative effect so that it (possibly)\nbecomes positive is a matter of debate. Inferring from related research\u2014for\nexample, on the relationship between local ethnic diversity and social trust\n(Dinesen and S\u00f8nderskov Reference Dinesen and S\u00f8nderskov2015)\u2014the type of\ntransient exposure studied by Sands might accumulate over time to manifest\nitself in lower support for redistribution more generally. Yet, consistent\nwith the literature on out-group contact, exposure may also come to resemble\n\u2018actual contact\u2019 (that is, meaningful personal interactions) when occurring\nover extended periods of time (Allport Reference Allport1954; Pettigrew and\nTropp Reference Pettigrew and Tropp2011). Consequently, such contact could\ngive rise to the positive relationship between exposure to inequality and\nsupport for redistribution observed in the contact-supporting work, which\narguably studies repeated exposure resulting from the general socio-economic\ncomposition in an area, which only changes gradually over time.Footnote ^5 In\nshort, the contrasting results from the two lines of work observing conflict\nand contact effects may potentially be reconcilable given the different time\nhorizons they implicitly study.\n\n## Research Design, Data, and Measurement\n\nOur study utilizes a within-individual research design linking panel survey\ndata with fine-grained individual-level registry data. The panel data are from\nthe Social and Political Panel Study, which is a three-wave panel collected in\n2008/9 (wave 1, collected as part of the European Social Survey), 2011/12\n(wave 2), and 2017 (wave 3). Appendix A.1 describes the panel data in detail.\n\nThe panel survey data are linked to individual-level registry data from\nStatistics Denmark, which contains longitudinal data on the exact geographical\nlocation of the place of residence for all individuals with primary residence\nin Denmark, except for some EU citizens, illegal residents, and asylum seekers\n(see Appendix A.2.1), and extensive socio-economic information, including\npersonal income, reported by public authorities. This allows us to construct\nmeasures of the income composition of individualized local contexts flexibly\nas circles with a given radius around the respondents. The precise and\nflexible measures of local inequality (and related variables, including\npotentially confounding factors) provide for a strong test of the proposed\nrelationship between local economic conditions and support for redistribution\ncompared to studies measuring exposure in more aggregate contexts (for\nexample, US counties) that may be imprecise reflections of people's everyday\nexperiences of income differences (Bisgaard, Dinesen, and S\u00f8nderskov Reference\nBisgaard, Dinesen and S\u00f8nderskov2016).\n\nOur dependent variable, support for redistribution, is measured by the widely\nused question included in the European Social Survey: \u2018[the] Government should\ntake measures to reduce differences in income levels\u2019 (for example, Dimick,\nRueda, and Stegmueller Reference Dimick, Rueda and Stegmueller2018)\u2014assessed\non a five-point Likert-scale from \u2018Agree strongly\u2019 (1) to \u2018Disagree strongly\n(5)\u2019 (reversed in the analysis). Focusing on a relatively general orientation\nrather than a stance on a specific policy (for example, the millionaire's tax\nin Sands' study) renders our test conservative, given the importance of\n\u2018linkability\u2019 between policies and attitudes (Citrin and Green Reference\nCitrin and Green1990).\n\nInspired by previous studies (Condon and Wichowsky Reference Condon and\nWichowsky2020; Franko and Livingston Reference Franko and Livingston2022), the\nindependent variable in the primary analyses\u2014exposure to poor individuals\u2014is\nmeasured as the share of residents in a local context (of a given size) with\nan income below the 20th percentile in the national income distribution. In\nrobustness checks, we employ two alternative measures of the independent\nvariable (see Appendix B.1). To examine the local foundation of our results,\nwe use measures of exposure to poor individuals in a range of context sizes,\nspecifically, circles with radii from 100 meters (=0.031 km^2; our primary\nspecification) up to 2,500 meters. The smallest, ultra-local context is our\nprimary focus because the immediate local context is more likely to capture\nquotidian exposure to social phenomena (Bisgaard, Dinesen, and S\u00f8nderskov\nReference Bisgaard, Dinesen and S\u00f8nderskov2016; Danckert, Dinesen, and\nS\u00f8nderskov Reference Danckert, Dinesen and S\u00f8nderskov2017; Dinesen and\nS\u00f8nderskov Reference Dinesen and S\u00f8nderskov2015)\u2014in our case, poverty.Footnote\n^6\n\nFigures A8\u2013A9 in the Appendix provide information about the correlates of\nwithin-individual changes in the share of poor individuals over time. All\nobserved covariates were only weakly correlated with changes in exposure to\npoor people (r < 0.17). Furthermore, neither positive nor negative changes\nseem to be concentrated in specific geographic regions (Figure A10). We also\nexamined whether changes in exposure to poor people are driven by replacement\nof residents (people moving in/out), changes in income of current residents,\nor relocation of respondents themselves in Appendix B.4.3 (note that we\nexcluded observations of recently relocated respondents altogether, see\nfootnote 6). The analyses show that all three kinds of changes contribute to\nthe variation in exposure to poor people. These analyses indicate that changes\nin exposure to poor individuals are not confined to particular places or\nprocesses.\n\nWe analyzed the panel data by means of two-way\u2014individual and time\u2014fixed-\neffects (TWFE) models, which analyze the relationship between exposure to the\npoor and support for redistribution within individuals over time and net of\nany general temporal fluctuations in support for redistribution. This strategy\nallows us to rule out confounding of the relationship between exposure to poor\npeople and redistribution support from time-invariant factors. In addition, we\ninclude a rich set of time-varying registry-based individual- and contextual-\nlevel control variables that potentially confound the relationship (see Table\nA1 in Appendix B.2). Parallel to related work (Danckert, Dinesen, and\nS\u00f8nderskov Reference Danckert, Dinesen and S\u00f8nderskov2017), we do not include\nmeasures of political ideology (or other predispositions) out of concerns for\npost-treatment bias (Angrist and Pischke Reference Angrist and Pischke2009) in\nthe fixed effects model that only analyze over-time changes.Footnote ^7 To\nanalyze the relationship separately for income groups, we interact exposure to\nthe poor with respondents' income quintile in the first survey wave in which\nthey are included in the analyses. Lastly, to gauge potential time-invariant\nsources of confounding, we also analyzed the relationship between exposure to\npoor individuals and support for redistribution in cross-sectional models\n(that is, without individual fixed effects).\n\n## Results\n\nThe upper panel in Fig. 1 presents the marginal effect of the share of poor\npeople in the local context across five income quintiles based on Model 1,\nTable A8 in the Appendix. As Fig. 1 illustrates, the marginal effect of the\nshare of poor in the local context is, statistically, significantly negative\n(\u22120.40, p < 0.01) for the top income quintile. By contrast, the corresponding\nmarginal effects are insignificant for all other income groups, and they\ndiffer significantly from the estimate for the richest group (except for the\nlower-middle income group). Further, the negative effect of exposure to poor\nindividuals for the richest quintile is quite substantial; a one standard\ndeviation increase in the local share of poor decreases support for\nredistribution by 5.1 percentage points. By comparison, Sands (Reference\nSands2017) finds that subjects become 4.4 percentage points less supportive of\na millionaire's tax when exposed to a noticeably poor-appearing person.\nFurther, Fig. 1 (lower panel, dark lines) indicates that the estimate is only\nsignificantly negative in smaller contexts (up to a radius of a couple of\nhundred meters). This tentatively suggests a rather local nature of the effect\nof exposure to the poor on the well-off's redistribution attitudes (Sands and\nde Kadt Reference Sands and de Kadt2020), but the imprecise estimates in\nlarger contexts prevent us from drawing any firm conclusions about this. In\nshort, our results demonstrate that exposure to poor individuals is associated\nwith lower support for redistribution among the richest individuals, thus\nsubstantiating the conflict perspective and, by implication, speaking in\nfavour of the self-selection explanation for the literature's diverging\nresults.\n\nFigure 1. Marginal effects of exposure to poor individuals across income\ngroups and context sizes.\n\nNote: The upper panel is based on the estimates reported in Model 1 in Table\nA8. The panel estimates in the lower panel are based on specifications similar\nto Model 1 in Table A8 but with varying contextual sizes. The cross-sectional\nestimates are based on specifications similar to Model 1 in Table A9.\n\nHow do we know that our results are driven by exposure to poor individuals,\ngiven that this group share is mechanically correlated with the share of other\nincome groups? Or, put more substantively, perhaps it is the psychological\ncomfort of being among more of their own kind (and thus fewer poor\nindividuals) that makes richer individuals less sceptical of redistribution.\nChanges in the share of poor and rich individuals, respectively, are\nrelatively highly correlated (r = \u20130.40), making it difficult to distinguish\ntheir effects empirically. Nevertheless, when adding the share of rich and its\ninteraction with income quintiles to our baseline specification, we observe\nthat while the negative marginal effect of exposure to the poor among the\nrichest quintile is reduced (from \u22120.40 to \u22120.34), it remains relatively\nstrong and statistically significant (see Appendix Table A8, Model 2).\nRelatedly, adding the local Gini coefficient (see Appendix B.2)\u2014a commonly\nused indicator of inequality, especially in country-comparative work (for\nexample, Dimick, Rueda, and Stegmueller Reference Dimick, Rueda and\nStegmueller2018)\u2014and its interaction with income quintiles (Model 3, Table\nA8), also leaves the estimated association for the richest individuals\nessentially unchanged.Footnote ^8 Similarly, repeating this analysis with a\nmeasure capturing income diversity (Minkoff and Lyons Reference Minkoff and\nLyons2019) does not affect the results (Model 4, Table A8). Surviving these\ndemanding tests speaks to the robustness of the relationship, and it carries\nthe important theoretical implication that it is specifically local exposure\nto poor individuals that reduces the well-off's support for redistribution,\nnot living among fewer people from their own income bracket or an unequal\nincome distribution in a more general sense.\n\nWe can further assess the self-selection explanation for the divergent results\nin the literature by comparing the estimated relationship between exposure to\npoor individuals and redistribution support among the better-off in cross-\nsectional and panel models, respectively. The dark (panel results) and light-\ngrey (cross-sectional results) lines in the lower panel of Fig. 1 provide this\ncomparison for different context sizes. Interestingly, while the relationship\nis consistently negative for the richest quintile in the panel models, it\nis\u2014in line with results from previous studies using cross-sectional\ndesignsFootnote ^9\u2014consistently positive (and sometimes statistically\nsignificant) in the cross-sectional models.Footnote ^10 This striking\ndivergence indicates that the selection, which plausibly accounts for the\ndivergence between the existing conflict and contact-supporting studies, is\nrooted in time-invariant characteristics that are held constant in the panel\nmodels but not in the cross-sectional models. Further supporting the selection\naccount for rich individuals is the fact that we find no such inversion in\neffects between the panel and the cross-sectional models for those in the\nlowest income quintile, who\u2014compared to the well-off\u2014are likely to be much\nmore constrained in their choice of residence (see Appendix C.2). The results\nalso hint at the sources of this time-invariant confounding. Given that the\ncross-sectional models control for a long list of precisely measured\n(registry-based) socio-demographic confounders, this suggests that the time-\ninvariant confounding is not rooted in social deprivation broadly conceived.\nInstead, \u2018deep\u2019 psychological predispositions (for example, personality traits\nor values)\u2014that cannot be measured through the registry data\u2014appear as\nplausible time-invariant confounders. Put more substantively, when we, at a\ngiven point in time, observe that richer individuals are more supportive of\nredistribution when living in a neighbourhood with a higher share of poorer\nindividuals, this reflects a sorting\u2014plausibly based on deep-held\npredispositions\u2014of more pro-redistribution individuals into these\nneighbourhoods rather than an effect of living among poor individuals.\n\nWe probe the negative effect of the share of poor individuals on\nredistribution support among the well-off in several robustness checks\n(reported in Appendices D.1\u2013D.4). First, we show that our results are robust\nwhen applying a matching TWFE-estimator, where individuals experiencing\npositive and negative changes, respectively, are matched on pre-treatment\ncharacteristics to allow changes in redistribution attitudes to vary with\nthese characteristics (see, for example, Sant'Anna and Zhao Reference\nSant'Anna and Zhao2020).Footnote ^11 Second, our results are generally robust\nto using alternative measures of exposure to poor individuals (a measure based\non half of the median income and a weighted (gradual) measure). Third, the\nresults are also robust to various sample modifications; for example,\nexcluding individuals younger than thirty years of age when calculating the\nshare of poor individuals to avoid conflating poverty with age composition,\nlimiting the sample to people staying put in the neighbourhood to (partly)\naddress the consequences of self-selection in and out of neighbourhoods over\ntime, and to drop restrictions on the length of residence as well as the\nnumber of people living within 100 meters of the respondents' residences.\nFourth, the within-individual estimates of exposure to poor individuals remain\nnegative and statistically significant when restricting the sample to include\nrich individuals only, thereby addressing income-group specific confounding\nfrom the control variables. Fifth, we find that past changes in support for\nredistribution do not significantly predict subsequent changes in the local\nshare of poor individuals, thereby supporting the parallel trends assumption.\nAlthough insignificant, the association between prior changes in\nredistribution attitudes and subsequent exposure is positive, tentatively\npointing to the self-selection explanation as a plausible account for the\npositive relationship found in contact-supporting studies. Collectively, these\nanalyses suggest that our results are rather robust.\n\nWe also conducted additional analyses to explore the conditionalities and\nscope of our results (see Appendix D.5). First, we find that the effect is\nprimarily driven by positive changes in exposure to poor individuals,\nsuggesting that the rich respond specifically to increases in exposure to poor\nindividuals. Second, consistent with the literature on politically motivated\ninformation processing (Bisgaard Reference Bisgaard2015; Taber and Lodge\nReference Taber and Lodge2006), political predispositions may condition\nresponses to exposure to poor individuals. More specifically, in the case of\npolitical ideology, exposure to a higher share of poor people locally might\ntrigger stronger opposition to redistribution among ideologically right-\nleaning, well-off individuals. We examine this conjecture by interacting\npolitical ideology (measured in the first wave of the panel survey) with\nsubsequent exposure to poor individuals among the rich (see Table A19 and\nFigure A23, Panel A in the appendix). We find no support for ideologically\nconditioned responses to local exposure to poor individuals. Third, we tried\nusing political ideology as the dependent variable to examine if the effect of\nexposure to poor individuals extends from a specific aspect of distributional\npolitics to more general political orientations among the rich. While in a\nsimilar direction as the results for support for redistribution, the estimated\neffects for political ideology are substantially weaker and statistically\ninsignificant (see Model 2, Table A19 in the Appendix). Thus, living among\npoor neighbors only to a limited extent manifests itself in rich individuals'\nbroader political ideology. Fourth, a placebo-like test shows that exposure to\npoor individuals does not matter with regard to immigration attitudes,\nindicating that the effect is restricted to classical distributional politics,\nnot newer, more value-based issues.\n\nLastly, while not our primary focus, it is worth noting that higher local\nexposure to poor individuals generally significantly increases support for\nredistribution among the lowest income quintile. Conversely, and in contrast\nto Sands and de Kadt's (Reference Sands and de Kadt2020) findings from South\nAfrica, we find no systematic effect of exposure to a higher share of rich\nindividuals for this income group (see Appendix E). One explanation for this\nresult might be that living with more people of the same low economic standing\nfurthers a sense of group solidarity. More importantly, when seen in\nconjunction with the primary result, this suggests that it is specifically\nexposure to poor individuals that is consequential for redistribution\nattitudes\u2014both for the bottom and the top income quintile. We conjecture that\nthis might have to do with the visibility of this group, but this remains\nspeculation and merits further attention in future research.\n\n## Conclusion and Discussion\n\nThis paper aims to explain the divergent findings in the literature on the\nrelationship between local inequality\u2014specifically exposure to poor\nindividuals among the well-off\u2014and support for redistribution. In short, we\nfind that local exposure to poor individuals reduces support for\nredistribution among the well-off\u2014supporting the conflict perspective\u2014and that\nself-selection is a likely explanation for why previous studies have found\nthat exposure to poor individuals furthers support for redistribution.\n\nOur study contributes by expanding the scope conditions of the negative effect\nof exposure to poor individuals on support for redistribution among the\nbetter-off observed in Sands' (Reference Sands2017) foundational study. First,\nwe show that the negative effect of exposure to poor individuals ostensibly\nconsolidates over time and thus extends beyond a transient effect after a\nspecific episode. Second, beyond the millionaire tax studied by Sands\n(Reference Sands2017), we show that the negative effect is observable in a\nmore abstract outcome by tapping general attitudes toward redistribution.\nThird, our findings show that the negative effect of exposure to poorer\nindividuals for redistribution support extends to a relatively economically\nequal Scandinavian welfare state where income differences are likely to be\nless pronounced and visible. In short, our findings significantly extend the\nscope of the negative effect of exposure to poor individuals on support for\nredistribution among the better-off.\n\nAt the same time, our work has limitations and raises new questions.\nTheoretically, we still have only a relatively rudimentary understanding of\nwhy exposure to poor individuals makes rich people less supportive of\nredistribution. Exploring what exact mechanisms\u2014for example, stereotype\nactivation or negative out-group affect\u2014underlie this \u2018conflict response\u2019 and\nwhy we do not see a symmetrical response when poor people are exposed to rich\nindividuals are relevant foci for future research. Further, while we have\nshown that self-selection might account for the \u2018contact-supporting\u2019 findings\nin the literature, discarding the extended version of contact theory based on\nour results would be mistaken. Like others, we have only addressed intergroup\ncontact by proxy of temporal exposure (arguably \u2018contact potential\u2019). This is\nclearly not an exhaustive measure of contact\u2014indeed, there are situations\nwhere contact may never emerge, even with temporally extended exposure\u2014and\nthere are other \u2018facilitating conditions\u2019\u2014friendship potential, common goals,\netc.\u2014that have been shown to promote positive intergroup relations (Allport\nReference Allport1954; Pettigrew and Tropp Reference Pettigrew and Tropp2011).\nFurther, work on the consequences of ethnic diversity has shown that contact\ncan moderate conflict responses (Stolle, Soroka, and Johnston Reference\nStolle, Soroka and Johnston2008), thereby pointing to the potential interplay\nbetween conflict and contact. In this regard, one avenue for further research\nwould be to study the consequences of economic out-group exposure in other,\nmore \u2018contact-prone\u2019 contexts than the residential one. Building on recent\nresearch (Rao Reference Rao2019), schools\u2014where parents work for a common\npurpose\u2014would be an interesting setting in this regard.\n\nLastly, finding that local exposure to poor individuals decreases support for\nredistribution among the well-off highlights the challenges associated with\nameliorating high levels of economic inequality. Rather than animating a self-\ncorrecting demand for greater equality, such experiences tend to perpetuate\ninequality by lowering the desire for redistribution among those who have the\nmeans to redistribute. At the same time, our finding that poor individuals\nrespond to local exposure to other poor people by becoming more supportive of\nredistribution provides a silver lining for those hoping to redress existing\ninequality. Ultimately, the contrasting reactions to local poverty between the\nrich and the poor highlight the material conditions underlying political\nconflicts around inequality.\n\n## Supplementary material\n\nThe supplementary material for this article can be found at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0007123424000061.\n\n## Data availability statement\n\nReplication material for this article can be found in Harvard Dataverse at:\nhttps://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/GCCULO.

The latter\n\u2018relational approach\u2019 can be viewed as an attempt to unpack which groups are\ndriving a given inequality effect. While we follow the latter approach in this\npaper\u2014our main operationalization of inequality is rich people's exposure to\npoor individuals\u2014our study is informed by previous work based on both\napproaches.\n\n^2 For example, a similar prediction follows from Dimick, Rueda, and\nStegm\u00fcller's (Reference Dimick, Rueda and Stegmueller2018) theory of income-\ndependent altruism, although instead of increased sympathy for the poor\nspecifically, this theory holds that rich individuals become more altruistic\nin general, when faced with inequality.\n\n^3 Relatedly, in a recent study, Sands and de Kadt (Reference Sands and de\nKadt2020) show that exposure to wealth prompts conflict-responses (i.e.,\nhigher support for redistribution) among poor individuals.\n\n^4 At more aggregate subnational levels\u2014e.g., American States\u2014there is mixed\nevidence for the conflict perspective (see, e.g., C\u00f4t\u00e8, House, and Willer\nReference C\u00f4te, House and Willer2015; Franko Reference Franko2016).\n\n^5 More specifically, existing contact-supporting studies, which link\ntraditional surveys to administrative data, measure more prolonged or repeated\nexposure to poor people living nearby than the transient single-episode\nexposure that Sands' study. This type of exposure, occurring over extended\nperiods, may come to resemble meaningful personal interactions (Allport\nReference Allport1954; Pettigrew and Tropp Reference Pettigrew and Tropp2011),\nwhich may then in turn explain the divergent findings.\n\n^6 As we discuss in Appendix A.1, we exclude person-wave observations of\npersons who, at the time of interview, had moved to their current address\nwithin 6 months prior to the interview as well as observations living in\nsparsely populated contexts (less than 15 neighbors and 2 families living\nwithin 100 meters) to increase validity and reliability of our contextual\nmeasures. In Appendix D.3, we examine the sensitivity of our results to these\nsample restrictions. The estimates based on models without restrictions are\nslightly attenuated but neither substantially nor significantly different from\nthose based on our primary sample.\n\n^7 To the extent that these predispositions do change over time and therefore,\nby implication, are not accounted for by the fixed effects, their changes may\nthemselves be a consequence of local exposure to poor individuals, which would\nintroduce post-treatment bias\u2014most likely a downward bias\u2014in the estimated\nrelationship between the latter and support for redistribution. To facilitate\ncomparison with earlier work, we tried including a measure of political\nideology (left-right self-placement) in the cross-sectional models (see\nfootnote 10).\n\n^8 We also examined the unconditional and conditional effect of Gini on\nsupport for redistribution without the parallel interaction between the income\nquintile and the share of the poor. As reported in Table A10 in Appendix C.1,\nwe find a negative but insignificant effect.\n\n^9 Ceteris paribus, this also speaks in favour of our findings being\nrepresentative of the larger universe of studies.\n\n^10 In Figure A24 in the appendix, we report results from cross-sectional\nmodels that include left-right self-placement as a measure of ideology to\nfacilitate comparison with earlier work including similar measures. As is\nevident from the figure, the cross-sectional estimates from models with and\nwithout left-right self-placement are virtually identical. Therefore, its\ninclusion has no implications for our inference regarding self-selection as a\nlikely explanation for the divergent results in the existing literature.\n\n^11 We also estimated the effect for each period to accommodate potential\nnegative weighting bias that may affect the ATT estimate in panel models with\nmore than one time period (Chaisemartin and D'Haultfoeuille Reference\nChaisemartin and D'Haultfoeuille2022). Again, we find a negative effect among\nthe well-off, although imprecisely estimated in the first period (see Figure\nA13).\n\n## References\n\nAllport, GW (1954) The Nature of Prejudice.
