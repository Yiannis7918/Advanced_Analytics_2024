Public companies drive the economy. They boost\nshareholder wealth, create jobs, deliver goods and services, fuel innovation,\nand influence communities. Thanks to reporting requirements, data for public\ncompanies is easy to come by, making them convenient subjects of study.\n\nOn the other hand, private companies in their earlier stages contribute to the\neconomy on a smaller scale, they have fewer stakeholders, and they don\u2019t\nreport to the SEC so collecting data is difficult.\n\nHowever, the economic and innovative potential of startups demands that this\nbusiness sector not be overlooked in studies of board composition and\ncorporate oversight.\n\n## Private Companies Dwarf Public Companies In Number\n\nFewer than 10,000 companies are traded on U.S. stock exchanges.\n\nThe number of public companies in this country is dwarfed by the more than\n60,000 private, venture-backed companies founded here since 1999.\n\nAccording to Crunchbase, these private companies have raised more than $1\ntrillion and employ more than 3 million people.\n\n## Today\u2019s Private Companies Are Tomorrow\u2019s Corporate Giants\n\nNearly half of public companies founded since 1979 began as venture-backed\nstartups.\n\nIn fact, the S&P 500 companies known as the \u201cMagnificent 7,\u201d which represent\nmore than a quarter of the entire U.S. market, all began as venture-backed\nstartups and went public within the last 24 years. The cumulative value of\nthose enterprises at the time of their IPOs was $132 billion. Those seven\ncompanies are worth $11.7 trillion today.\n\nThe market-movers of the future are getting their start today in kitchens,\ngarages and dorm rooms around the country.\n\n## Private Companies Drive Innovation\n\nIn many ways, private companies are the country\u2019s technology incubator,\ndesigning the future we will inhabit, from AI to health care to clean tech.\n\nConsider rideshare services or social media platforms to appreciate how\ncompanies can change the way we and our families live. Uber and Meta (then\nFacebook) were privately held when they created the offerings that have become\npart of our everyday lives.\n\nBefore they hit the public markets, private companies build the products and\ndefine the business models that will shape society for decades to come.\n\n## The Opportunity For Significant Influence Is Early\n\nIt\u2019s during these early years of rapid innovation, long before they go public,\nthat companies come to codify their corporate DNA \u2013 their market offerings,\ntheir way of doing business, their corporate culture.\n\nFor that reason, the pre-IPO period is formative \u2013 a critical time for\ninfluence before the scrutiny of the public markets makes dramatic business\nchanges more challenging and costly.\n\n## Yet Data On Private Company Boards Has Been Scarce\n\nWhen Him For Her was formed in 2018, we looked for studies to help us\nunderstand board diversity and track progress. Annual reports from Spencer\nStuart and Equilar, for example, provide insight into the boards of S&P 500\nand Russell 3000 public companies, respectively. But we couldn\u2019t find tracking\nstudies focused on private company boards \u2013 not surprising since private\ncompanies aren\u2019t usually required to disclose their boards in public filings.\n\nTo fill this data gap, we teamed up with Crunchbase and Professor Lauren\nRivera from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern to create a\nmethodology for researching the boards of the most heavily funded private\ncompanies. We released our inaugural study in 2019.\n\nFive years later, we are releasing our latest annual report with a data set\nencompassing 735 companies and nearly 5,000 board members, responsible for\noverseeing roughly $220 billion in funding and nearly 300,000 employees.\n\nOne of the private companies profiled in our study, Virta Health, is working\nto reverse type 2 diabetes in 100 million people. \u201cWith a goal this\nambitious,\u201d says founder and CEO Sami Inkinen, \u201cdiversity must be a\ncornerstone of our approach. To build a great business we have to understand\nand identify with the people we serve.\u201d\n\nSuccessfully navigating today\u2019s business challenges requires a breadth of\nperspectives. That\u2019s as true for private companies as it is for public.\n\nSee our research on private company boards or request help with your board\nsearch.\n\n\u00a9 2024 HIM FOR HER, INC.
