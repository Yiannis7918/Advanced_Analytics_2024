It offers a minimal low-level API and does not prescribe trust\nschemes or key management policies. It fully supports all functionality\nrequired by the Autocrypt 1.1 e-mail encryption specification.\n\nrPGP is regularly published as the pgp Crate and its RSA implementation lives\nunder the collective RustCrypto umbrella. For ECC crypto support we are using\nCurve25519-dalek.\n\n> Please note that the API is not well documented yet. You may check out the\n> tests which exercise the API. Please open issues here if if you are\n> attempting to use rPGP and need help.\n\n## Status (Last updated: October 2019)\n\nrPGP and its RSA dependency got an independent security audit mid 2019, see\nhere for the full report from IncludeSecurity. No critical flaws were found\nand we have fixed most high, medium and low risk ones.\n\nrPGP is used in production by Delta Chat, the e-mail based messenger app\nsuite, successfully running on Windows, Linux, macOS, Android and iOS in 32bit\n(only Windows and Android) and 64 bit builds (for the other platforms).\n\nMore details on platform and OpenPGP implementation status:\n\n  * OpenPGP Status document which describes what of OpenPGP is supported\n  * Platform status document which describes current platform support.\n\n### Experimental WASM Support\n\nWhen enabeling the wasm feature, rpgp can be compiled to run using WASM in\nNode.js and the supported Browsers. Experimental bindings for this can be\nfound in rpgp/rpgp-js.\n\n## Developement\n\nTo run the stress tests,\n\n    \n    \n    > git submodule update --init --recursive > cargo test --release -- --ignored\n\nTo enable debugging, add\n\n    \n    \n    use pretty_env_logger; let _ = pretty_env_logger::try_init();\n\nAnd then run tests with RUST_LOG=pgp=info.\n\n## How is rPGP different from Sequoia?\n\nSome key differences:\n\n  * rPGP has a more permissive license than Sequoia, which allows a broader usage\n\n  * rPGP is a library with a well-defined, relatively small feature-set where Sequoia also tries to be a replacement for the GPG command line tool\n\n  * All crypto used in rPGP is implemented in pure Rust, whereas Sequoia by default uses Nettle, which is implemented in C.\n\n## Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)\n\nAll crates in this repository support Rust 1.70 or higher. In future minimally\nsupported version of Rust can be changed, but it will be done with a minor\nversion bump.\n\n## LICENSE\n\nMIT or Apache 2.0\n\n## Contribution\n\nUnless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution submitted for\ninclusion in rPGP by you, as defined in the Apache-2.0 license, shall be dual\nlicensed as above, without any additional terms or conditions.\n\n## About\n\nPure rust implementation of OpenPGP\n\ndocs.rs/pgp\n\n### Topics\n\nrust cryptography pgp openpgp\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\n### License\n\nActivity\n\nCustom properties\n\n### Stars\n\n449 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n10 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n67 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases 4\n\nv0.11.0 Latest\n\nFeb 21, 2024\n\n\\+ 3 releases\n\n## Used by 756\n\n\\+ 748\n\n## Contributors 31\n\n\\+ 17 contributors\n\n## Languages\n\n  * Rust 99.5%\n  * Other 0.5%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
