Nowadays, online networked platforms dominate digital markets\n> and capitalization leader-boards, while social networks drive public\n> discussion. Despite the importance of networks in many economic and social\n> domains (economics, sociology, anthropology, psychology,...), the knowledge\n> about the laws that dominate their dynamics is still scarce and fragmented.\n> Here, we analyse a wide set of online networks (those financed by\n> advertising) by investigating their value dynamics from several\n> perspectives: the type of service, the geographic scope, the merging between\n> networks, and the relationship between economic and financial value. The\n> results show that the networks are dominated by strongly nonlinear dynamics.\n> The existence of non-linearity is often underestimated in social sciences\n> because it involves contexts that are difficult to deal with, such as the\n> presence of multiple equilibria -- some of which are unstable. Yet, these\n> dynamics must be fully understood and addressed if we aim to understand the\n> recent evolution in the economic, political and social milieus, which are\n> precisely characterised by corner equilibria (e.g., polarization, winner-\n> take-all solutions, increasing inequality) and nonlinear patterns.\n\nSubjects:| Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph); Social and Information\nNetworks (cs.SI); General Economics (econ.GN)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2208.04813 [physics.soc-ph]  \n(or arXiv:2208.04813v2 [physics.soc-ph] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2208.04813arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Antonio Scala PhD [view email] [v1] Tue, 9 Aug 2022 14:44:59 UTC (571\nKB) [v2] Wed, 26 Oct 2022 13:08:30 UTC (271 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled The explosive value of the networks, by Antonio\nScala and Marco Delmastro\n\n  * View PDF\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\nphysics.soc-ph\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2022-08\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.SI econ econ.GN physics q-fin q-fin.EC\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
