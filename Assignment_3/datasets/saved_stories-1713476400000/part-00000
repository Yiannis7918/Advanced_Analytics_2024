Gitlin - 4/17/2024, 1:57 PM\n\nEnlarge / Honda's forward collision warning system has always been sensitive.\nNow the NHTSA is investigating some Hondas for false-positive automatic\nemergency brake activations.\n\nHonda\n\n#### reader comments\n\n174\n\nThis week, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration decided to\nexpand an ongoing investigation into the alarming tendency of some modern\nHondas to inappropriately trigger their automatic emergency braking systems.\nStudies have shown that automatic emergency braking systems have reduced road\ndeaths in the US, Europe, and China, but so-called phantom braking problems\nhave dogged systems from Tesla and Honda.\n\nWe first learned of the problem in 2022, when NHTSA opened a preliminary\ninvestigation into the matter, based on 278 complaints. Now, NHTSA's Office of\nDefects Investigation has received 1,294 complaints from drivers of Honda CR-\nVs (model years 2017\u20132022) and Honda Accords (model years 2018\u20132022), all\nclaiming that their Hondas' automatic emergency braking system slammed on the\nbrakes with no apparent obstruction in the way.\n\nHonda says it's aware of even more cases\u20141,991 in all, and NHTSA says that,\nwhen it takes out cases where multiple reports affect the same vehicle, it\nknows of 2,976 reports of inadvertent automatic emergency braking, with 93\ninjury reports and 47 crashes to date.\n\nNow, NHTSA's ODI has upgraded the case to a full engineering analysis and\nincludes the model year 2018\u20132022 Honda Accord, model year 2018\u20132022 Honda\nAccord Hybrid, model year 2017\u20132022 Honda CR-V, and model year 2020\u20132022 Honda\nCR-V Hybrid\u2014all told, about 3 million cars on US roads.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n174\n\nJonathan M.

Beginning with the original Drivatar AI in Forza Motorsport for\nXBOX in 2005, Greenawalt and his colleagues experimented with computer\nlearning, refining their methods from iteration to iteration. It was once the\nAI system was unshackled from local hard drives and placed online in Forza\nMotorsport 5, however, that the floodgates truly opened. As the AI rapidly\nevolved, producing unexpected new behaviors, the Forza team quickly learned\nhow challenging it would be to wield this two-edged sword in creating\nrealistic opponents.\n\n  * ##### How Forza's Racing AI Uses Neural Networks To Evolve\n\n  * ##### The supercharged Ferrari 488 GTB | Ars Technica\n\n  * ##### Aston Martin's DB11 V12\n\n  * ##### Fast, fun, and freaky: A review of the Alfa Romeo Stelvio\n\n  * ##### The best features of the best cars at the L.A.
