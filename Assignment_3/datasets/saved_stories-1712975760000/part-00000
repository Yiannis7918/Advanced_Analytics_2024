Security, Identity, & Compliance | Permalink | Comments | Share\n\nToday, AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is introducing faster options for\nautomatic symmetric key rotation. We\u2019re also introducing rotate on-demand,\nrotation visibility improvements, and a new limit on the price of all\nsymmetric keys that have had two or more rotations (including existing keys).\nIn this post, I discuss all those capabilities and changes. I also present a\nbroader overview of how symmetric cryptographic key rotation came to be, and\ncover our recommendations on when you might need rotation and how often to\nrotate your keys. If you\u2019ve ever been curious about AWS KMS automatic key\nrotation\u2014why it exists, when to enable it, and when to use it on-demand\u2014read\non.\n\n## How we got here\n\nThere are longstanding reasons for cryptographic key rotation. If you were\nCaesar in Roman times and you needed to send messages with sensitive\ninformation to your regional commanders, you might use keys and ciphers to\nencrypt and protect your communications. There are well-documented examples of\nusing cryptography to protect communications during this time, so much so that\nthe standard substitution cipher, where you swap each letter for a different\nletter that is a set number of letters away in the alphabet, is referred to as\nCaesar\u2019s cipher. The cipher is the substitution mechanism, and the key is the\nnumber of letters away from the intended letter you go to find the substituted\nletter for the ciphertext.\n\nThe challenge for Caesar in relying on this kind of symmetric key cipher is\nthat both sides (Caesar and his field generals) needed to share keys and keep\nthose keys safe from prying eyes. What happens to Caesar\u2019s secret invasion\nplans if the key used to encipher his attack plan was secretly intercepted in\ntransmission down the Appian Way? Caesar had no way to know. But if he rotated\nkeys, he could limit the scope of which messages could be read, thus limiting\nhis risk. Messages sent under a key created in the year 52 BCE wouldn\u2019t\nautomatically work for messages sent the following year, provided that Caesar\nrotated his keys yearly and the newer keys weren\u2019t accessible to the\nadversary. Key rotation can reduce the scope of data exposure (what a threat\nactor can see) when some but not all keys are compromised. Of course, every\ntime the key changed, Caesar had to send messengers to his field generals to\ncommunicate the new key. Those messengers had to ensure that no enemies\nintercepted the new keys without their knowledge \u2013 a daunting task.\n\nFigure 1: The state of the art for secure key rotation and key distribution in\n52 BC.\n\n### Fast forward to the 1970s\u20132000s\n\nIn modern times, cryptographic algorithms designed for digital computer\nsystems mean that keys no longer travel down the Appian Way. Instead, they\nmove around digital systems, are stored in unprotected memory, and sometimes\nare printed for convenience. The risk of key leakage still exists, therefore\nthere is a need for key rotation. During this period, more significant\nsecurity protections were developed that use both software and hardware\ntechnology to protect digital cryptographic keys and reduce the need for\nrotation. The highest-level protections offered by these techniques can limit\nkeys to specific devices where they can never leave as plaintext. In fact, the\nUS National Institute of Standards and Technologies (NIST) has published a\nspecific security standard, FIPS 140, that addresses the security requirements\nfor these cryptographic modules.\n\n### Modern cryptography also has the risk of cryptographic key wear-out\n\nBesides addressing risks from key leakage, key rotation has a second important\nbenefit that becomes more pronounced in the digital era of modern\ncryptography\u2014cryptographic key wear-out. A key can become weaker, or \u201cwear\nout,\u201d over time just by being used too many times. If you encrypt enough data\nunder one symmetric key, and if a threat actor acquires enough of the\nresulting ciphertext, they can perform analysis against your ciphertext that\nwill leak information about the key. Current cryptographic recommendations to\nprotect against key wear-out can vary depending on how you\u2019re encrypting data,\nthe cipher used, and the size of your key. However, even a well-designed AES-\nGCM implementation with robust initialization vectors (IVs) and large key size\n(256 bits) should be limited to encrypting no more than 4.3 billion messages\n(2^32), where each message is limited to about 64 GiB under a single key.\n\nFigure 2: Used enough times, keys can wear out.\n\nDuring the early 2000s, to help federal agencies and commercial enterprises\nnavigate key rotation best practices, NIST formalized several of the best\npractices for cryptographic key rotation in the NIST SP 800-57 Recommendation\nfor Key Management standard. It\u2019s an excellent read overall and I encourage\nyou to examine Section 5.3 in particular, which outlines ways to determine the\nappropriate length of time (the cryptoperiod) that a specific key should be\nrelied on for the protection of data in various environments. According to the\nguidelines, the following are some of the benefits of setting cryptoperiods\n(and rotating keys within these periods):\n\n> 5.3 Cryptoperiods\n>\n> A cryptoperiod is the time span during which a specific key is authorized\n> for use by legitimate entities or the keys for a given system will remain in\n> effect. A suitably defined cryptoperiod:\n>\n>   1. Limits the amount of information that is available for cryptanalysis to\n> reveal the key (e.g. the number of plaintext and ciphertext pairs encrypted\n> with the key);\n>   2. Limits the amount of exposure if a single key is compromised;\n>   3. Limits the use of a particular algorithm (e.g., to its estimated\n> effective lifetime);\n>   4. Limits the time available for attempts to penetrate physical,\n> procedural, and logical access mechanisms that protect a key from\n> unauthorized disclosure;\n>   5. Limits the period within which information may be compromised by\n> inadvertent disclosure of a cryptographic key to unauthorized entities; and\n>   6. Limits the time available for computationally intensive cryptanalysis.\n>\n\n>\n> Sometimes, cryptoperiods are defined by an arbitrary time period or maximum\n> amount of data protected by the key. However, trade-offs associated with the\n> determination of cryptoperiods involve the risk and consequences of\n> exposure, which should be carefully considered when selecting the\n> cryptoperiod (see Section 5.6.4).\n>\n> (Source: NIST SP 800-57 Recommendation for Key Management, page 34).\n\nOne of the challenges in applying this guidance to your own use of\ncryptographic keys is that you need to understand the likelihood of each risk\noccurring in your key management system. This can be even harder to evaluate\nwhen you\u2019re using a managed service to protect and use your keys.\n\n### Fast forward to the 2010s: Envisioning a key management system where you\nmight not need automatic key rotation\n\nWhen we set out to build a managed service in AWS in 2014 for cryptographic\nkey management and help customers protect their AWS encryption workloads, we\nwere mindful that our keys needed to be as hardened, resilient, and protected\nagainst external and internal threat actors as possible. We were also mindful\nthat our keys needed to have long-term viability and use built-in protections\nto prevent key wear-out. These two design constructs\u2014that our keys are\nstrongly protected to minimize the risk of leakage and that our keys are safe\nfrom wear out\u2014are the primary reasons we recommend you limit key rotation or\nconsider disabling rotation if you don\u2019t have compliance requirements to do\nso. Scheduled key rotation in AWS KMS offers limited security benefits to your\nworkloads.\n\nSpecific to key leakage, AWS KMS keys in their unencrypted, plaintext form\ncannot be accessed by anyone, even AWS operators. Unlike Caesar\u2019s keys, or\neven cryptographic keys in modern software applications, keys generated by AWS\nKMS never exist in plaintext outside of the NIST FIPS 140-2 Security Level 3\nfleet of hardware security modules (HSMs) in which they are used. See the\nrelated post AWS KMS is now FIPS 140-2 Security Level 3. What does this mean\nfor you? for more information about how AWS KMS HSMs help you prevent\nunauthorized use of your keys. Unlike many commercial HSM solutions, AWS KMS\ndoesn\u2019t even allow keys to be exported from the service in encrypted form.\nWhy? Because an external actor with the proper decryption key could then\nexpose the KMS key in plaintext outside the service.\n\nThis hardened protection of your key material is salient to the principal\nsecurity reason customers want key rotation. Customers typically envision\nrotation as a way to mitigate a key leaking outside the system in which it was\nintended to be used. However, since KMS keys can be used only in our HSMs and\ncannot be exported, the possibility of key exposure becomes harder to\nenvision. This means that rotating a key as protection against key exposure is\nof limited security value. The HSMs are still the boundary that protects your\nkeys from unauthorized access, no matter how many times the keys are rotated.\n\nIf we decide the risk of plaintext keys leaking from AWS KMS is sufficiently\nlow, don\u2019t we still need to be concerned with key wear-out? AWS KMS mitigates\nthe risk of key wear-out by using a key derivation function (KDF) that\ngenerates a unique, derived AES 256-bit key for each individual request to\nencrypt or decrypt under a 256-bit symmetric KMS key. Those derived encryption\nkeys are different every time, even if you make an identical call for encrypt\nwith the same message data under the same KMS key. The cryptographic details\nfor our key derivation method are provided in the AWS KMS Cryptographic\nDetails documentation, and KDF operations use the KDF in counter mode, using\nHMAC with SHA256. These KDF operations make cryptographic wear-out\nsubstantially different for KMS keys than for keys you would call and use\ndirectly for encrypt operations. A detailed analysis of KMS key protections\nfor cryptographic wear-out is provided in the Key Management at the Cloud\nScale whitepaper, but the important take-away is that a single KMS key can be\nused for more than a quadrillion (2^50) encryption requests without wear-out\nrisk.\n\nIn fact, within the NIST 800-57 guidelines is consideration that when the KMS\nkey (key-wrapping key in NIST language) is used with unique data keys, KMS\nkeys can have longer cryptoperiods:\n\n> \u201cIn the case of these very short-term key-wrapping keys, an appropriate\n> cryptoperiod (i.e., which includes both the originator and recipient-usage\n> periods) is a single communication session. It is assumed that the wrapped\n> keys will not be retained in their wrapped form, so the originator-usage\n> period and recipient-usage period of a key-wrapping key is the same. In\n> other cases, a key-wrapping key may be retained so that the files or\n> messages encrypted by the wrapped keys may be recovered later. In such\n> cases, the recipient-usage period may be significantly longer than the\n> originator-usage period of the key-wrapping key, and cryptoperiods lasting\n> for years may be employed.\u201d\n>\n> Source: NIST 800-57 Recommendations for Key Management, section 5.3.6.7.\n\n## So why did we build key rotation in AWS KMS in the first place?\n\nAlthough we advise that key rotation for KMS keys is generally not necessary\nto improve the security of your keys, you must consider that guidance in the\ncontext of your own unique circumstances. You might be required by internal\nauditors, external compliance assessors, or even your own customers to provide\nevidence of regular rotation of all keys. A short list of regulatory and\nstandards groups that recommend key rotation includes the aforementioned NIST\n800-57, Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmarks, ISO 27001, System and\nOrganization Controls (SOC) 2, the Payment Card Industry Data Security\nStandard (PCI DSS), COBIT 5, HIPAA, and the Federal Financial Institutions\nExamination Council (FFIEC) Handbook, just to name a few.\n\nCustomers in regulated industries must consider the entirety of all the\ncryptographic systems used across their organizations. Taking inventory of\nwhich systems incorporate HSM protections, which systems do or don\u2019t provide\nadditional security against cryptographic wear-out, or which programs\nimplement encryption in a robust and reliable way can be difficult for any\norganization. If a customer doesn\u2019t have sufficient cryptographic expertise in\nthe design and operation of each system, it becomes a safer choice to mandate\na uniform scheduled key rotation.\n\nThat is why we offer an automatic, convenient method to rotate symmetric KMS\nkeys. Rotation allows customers to demonstrate this key management best\npractice to their stakeholders instead of having to explain why they chose not\nto.\n\nFigure 3 details how KMS appends new key material within an existing KMS key\nduring each key rotation.\n\nFigure 3: KMS key rotation process\n\nWe designed the rotation of symmetric KMS keys to have low operational impact\nto both key administrators and builders using those keys. As shown in Figure\n3, a keyID configured to rotate will append new key material on each rotation\nwhile still retaining and keeping the existing key material of previous\nversions. This append method achieves rotation without having to decrypt and\nre-encrypt existing data that used a previous version of a key. New encryption\nrequests under a given keyID will use the latest key version, while decrypt\nrequests under that keyID will use the appropriate version. Callers don\u2019t have\nto name the version of the key they want to use for encrypt/decrypt, AWS KMS\nmanages this transparently.\n\nSome customers assume that a key rotation event should forcibly re-encrypt any\ndata that was ever encrypted under the previous key version. This is not\nnecessary when AWS KMS automatically rotates to use a new key version for\nencrypt operations. The previous versions of keys required for decrypt\noperations are still safe within the service.\n\nWe\u2019ve offered the ability to automatically schedule an annual key rotation\nevent for many years now. Lately, we\u2019ve heard from some of our customers that\nthey need to rotate keys more frequently than the fixed period of one year. We\nwill address our newly launched capabilities to help meet these needs in the\nfinal section of this blog post.\n\n## More options for key rotation in AWS KMS (with a price reduction)\n\nAfter learning how we think about key rotation in AWS KMS, let\u2019s get to the\nnew options we\u2019ve launched in this space:\n\n  * Configurable rotation periods: Previously, when using automatic key rotation, your only option was a fixed annual rotation period. You can now set a rotation period from 90 days to 2,560 days (just over seven years). You can adjust this period at any point to reset the time in the future when rotation will take effect. Existing keys set for rotation will continue to rotate every year.\n  * On-demand rotation for KMS keys: In addition to more flexible automatic key rotation, you can now invoke on-demand rotation through the AWS Management Console for AWS KMS, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or the AWS KMS API using the new RotateKeyOnDemand API. You might occasionally need to use on-demand rotation to test workloads, or to verify and prove key rotation events to internal or external stakeholders. Invoking an on-demand rotation won\u2019t affect the timeline of any upcoming rotation scheduled for this key.\n\n> Note: We\u2019ve set a default quota of 10 on-demand rotations for a KMS key.\n> Although the need for on-demand key rotation should be infrequent, you can\n> ask to have this quota raised. If you have a repeated need for testing or\n> validating instant key rotation, consider deleting the test keys and\n> repeating this operation for RotateKeyOnDemand on new keys.\n\n  * Improved visibility: You can now use the AWS KMS console or the new ListKeyRotations API to view previous key rotation events. One of the challenges in the past is that it\u2019s been hard to validate that your KMS keys have rotated. Now, every previous rotation for a KMS key that has had a scheduled or on-demand rotation is listed in the console and available via API.\n\nFigure 4: Key rotation history showing date and type of rotation\n\n  * Price cap for keys with more than two rotations: We\u2019re also introducing a price cap for automatic key rotation. Previously, each annual rotation of a KMS key added $1 per month to the price of the key. Now, for KMS keys that you rotate automatically or on-demand, the first and second rotation of the key adds $1 per month in cost (prorated hourly), but this price increase is capped at the second rotation. Rotations after your second rotation aren\u2019t billed. Existing customers that have keys with three or more annual rotations will see a price reduction for those keys to $3 per month (prorated) per key starting in the month of May, 2024.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn this post, I highlighted the more flexible options that are now available\nfor key rotation in AWS KMS and took a broader look into why key rotation\nexists. We know that many customers have compliance needs to demonstrate key\nrotation everywhere, and increasingly, to demonstrate faster or immediate key\nrotation. With the new reduced pricing and more convenient ways to verify key\nrotation events, we hope these new capabilities make your job easier.\n\nFlexible key rotation capabilities are now available in all AWS Regions,\nincluding the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. To learn more about this new\ncapability, see the Rotating AWS KMS keys topic in the AWS KMS Developer\nGuide.\n\nIf you have feedback about this post, submit comments in the Comments section\nbelow.
