If you\u2019d like to\nsign up, you can do so here. Or just read on...\n\nToday I\u2019m going to write about Varsity Brands, the Bain Capital-owned\ncorporation which controls the sport of cheerleading. I love this monopoly\nbecause it\u2019s so easy to explain, and also because the tactics Varsity Brands\nuses are the same that every monopolist uses, only with more glitter. But\nfirst, two pieces of good news.\n\nOne, the Federal Trade Commission blocked a merger! The FTC threatened to file\nsuit against a merger of two companies - TreeHouse Foods and Post Holdings -\nin the private label cereal market. So the companies abandoned the deal.\nStopping mergers like this sends a message that there are cops on the beat.\nThe popular interest in monopoly is working. Absent a more highly charged\npolitical atmosphere, the FTC would almost certainly have let this one go\nthrough.\n\nTwo, the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice withdrew their\n1984 non-horizontal merger guidelines. Basically they are admitting that the\nway they looked at mergers for forty years is dumb. It\u2019s good but not great\nnews. The FTC/DOJ are trying to replace those guidelines with new rules so\nsilly they don\u2019t even mention \u2018data.\u2019 But at least we\u2019re out of the Reagan era\nhellscape.\n\nAnd now...\n\n##\n\nBring It On\n\nOne of the most fascinating parts of studying monopolies is how most of them\nuse very similar tactics in different industries, like Bill Gates and John D.\nRockefeller, or A&P supermarket in the 1920s vs Amazon. What I also love is\nfinding weird areas of monopolization, and there are so many, because\nconcentration is a systemic feature of the American political economy. This\nmonopoly combines both aspects.\n\nTwo days ago, a colleague of mine, Sarah Miller, told me, \u2018hey did you know\nthere\u2019s a cheerleading monopoly?\u2019 I looked, and sure enough, there is! And\nit\u2019s owned by Bain Capital. Sometimes the universe aligns and gives me the\nperfect monopoly to write about.\n\nCheerlebrities and Dollars\n\nCheerleading is a huge part of American culture, evolving from a male oriented\nsideline spectacle in the 1940s to a serious female-dominated sport that sits\nbetween dance and gymnastics. There were many later famous men who were\ncheerleaders, everyone from FDR to Jimmy Stewart to George W. Bush. Here\u2019s a\npicture of cheerleader Ronald Reagan.\n\nToday most cheerleaders are girls and young women, with one estimate of\n400,000 in public high schools alone. But cheer goes way beyond high schools,\nthere are now thousands of competitive dance teams, with members ages 7-17,\nwho enter competitions, with something like 3.3 million who cheer in any given\nyear, and 1.3 million cheerleaders across American who cheer for more than 60\ndays a year.\n\nHigh school and college age athletes participate in high profile competitions,\nget sponsorships, endure immense amounts of pain, and show off in contests and\non social media. Cheerleaders are disciplined and often fanatical. The sport\ncauses more than half the catastrophic injuries for female athletes in\nAmerica, including skull fractures. And yet thousands of young girls wear\ncheer leggings and t-shirts, practice arm motions and cartwheels nonstop, and\nobsess over Instagram star \u201ccheerlebrities.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an expensive sport, especially at the top, with top athletes spending\n$15,000 or more a year for competition uniforms, practice clothes, jackets,\npersonalized bags, summer camps, tumbling classes, squad practices with\nprofessional cheerleading programs, and choreography fees. Families involved\nin cheerleading are above average in terms of affluence, and even non-top\nathletes spend between $2,500 to $10,000 a year.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where the monopoly comes in. The key player in the cheerleading\nworld is Varsity Brands, which makes its money from cheerleading apparel,\ncamps and competitions. The founder, Jeff Webb, started Varsity in the 1970s\nto offer high school training camps and clinics, eventually creating\ncompetitions for cheerleaders.\n\nIt\u2019s with equipment and apparel where Varsity makes its money, \u201ceverything\nfrom the sequined uniforms on cheerleaders\u2019 backs to the big bows in their\npoofed-up hair.\u201d The key to Varsity\u2019s monopoly is its chokepoint control of\nmajor cheerleading competitions. In the early 1980s, ESPN began showcasing the\nnew sport, giving it wide distribution. In 2004, Varsity bought the National\nCheerleaders Association, and has rolled up a dozen more, including its main\ncompetitor in 2015, Jam Brands. Today, competing means entering Varsity\u2019s\nworld.\n\nWhile Webb is an aggressive businessman, Varsity had help from private equity;\nCharlesbank Capital Partners bought the company in 2014. Charlesbank organized\na roll-up of the industry, in its public case study noting that it helped\norchestrate the Jam Brands purchase, as well as a series of \u201chighly strategic\nacquisitions.\u201d These new private equity owners had Varsity buy up sports\nequipment distributors and enter the marching band space. Charlesbank sold it\nto fellow private equity firm Bain Capital in 2018.\n\nVarsity\u2019s market power over the business of cheerleading is entrenched.\nParticipating in cheerleading competitions is expensive. If you want to see a\nbunch of cynical cheerleaders and cheerleading families angry about monopoly\npower, check out the discussion on Fierceboard about the acquisition and what\nit meant for what they would have to pay. It\u2019s also costly to be a spectator.\nHere\u2019s a sycophantic interviewer interviewing Webb about how much it costs as\na parent spectator to watch one of these events, congratulating the CEO on his\npricing power. This market power extends to media. Not only does Varsity own\nmagazines, but on Netflix\u2019s Cheer, cheerleaders complain that they can\u2019t watch\ncheerleading on TV anymore, because Varsity streams its competitions over its\nfor-pay app Varsity TV, moving ESPN out of the picture.\n\nIn 2018, when speaking to Chief Executive magazine, Webb made it clear that\nmonopolization was the strategy.\n\n> We were really creating an industry as we went along and it became an\n> ecosystem in that we were creating the concept, we were creating the\n> industry, and then we were positioning ourselves to provide all the products\n> and services that that affinity group utilized.\n\nWebb\u2019s strategy worked. In 2016, competitors estimated that Varsity had 80% of\nthe market for apparel, and 90% of the market for competitions.\n\nRebates, Gyms and Vertical Integration\n\nVarsity uses tactics reminiscent of a glittery John D. Rockefeller. According\nto Leigh Buchanan in Inc., \u201cTeams appearing in Varsity competitions can wear\nwhatever uniforms they want. But rival apparel makers can't show their wares\nat those events, which are important showrooms for cheer merchandise.\u201d That is\nin antitrust parlance a form of \u2018vertical foreclosure,\u2019 or using your control\nof one part in the supply chain, in this case competitions, to block rivals\nwho compete with you in another area, apparel. This became quite obvious when\nJam Brands, which ran most non-Varsity competitions, merged with Varsity,\nimmediately ending marketing agreements with Varsity apparel competitors.\n\nThere\u2019s more than blocking advertising and distribution at these competitions.\nWebb admitted that in at least one contest, cheerleaders got more points if\nthey used more Varsity equipment as props. In other words, it\u2019s not just a\nrigged game as some sort of metaphor, Varsity actually rigged the rules of its\ncheerleading competition to coerce purchases of Varsity products. Indeed, Webb\nhas testified in court that the competitions exist solely for the \u201cpromotion\nof his cheerleading supply business.\u201d\n\nThis level of control hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed. As one person in the cheerleading\nworld sarcastically put it in 2014:\n\n> Shocking that they don't have officially sanctioned Varsity make-up,\n> underwear, and no-show socks yet (or maybe they do, who knows?) I can\n> foresee the Varsity Secret Police (the same ones that patrol the lobbies of\n> non-STP hotels looking for girls in bows & bling) checking each athlete in\n> warm-ups to make sure they are wearing Varsity brand hair clips and rubber\n> bands.\n\nAnd then there are the gyms, where cheerleaders train and form teams. Most\ncheerleaders buy their uniforms and apparel from their gym. Varsity owns some\ngyms, and has strong control over others. Varsity signs multi-year supply\ncontracts with gyms, giving them a cash rebate if gyms send their cheerleaders\nto Varsity competitions and buy Varsity equipment. It\u2019s not a surprise to see\nrebates used in this space. Rebates are a standard tool of monopolists; they\nare how Standard Oil controlled railroads, and how Microsoft orchestrated its\npower over computer makers.\n\nLike a good organizer of market power, Varsity also extends and expands its\nlegal powers. The corporation sued a competitor for copyright violations,\ngoing all the way to the Supreme Court to establish the ability to copyright\ncheerleading outfits (Sotomayor, Kagan, and RBG took Varsity\u2019s side).\n\nSuffice to say, it is difficult to compete in the market.\n\n> Some small competitors just throw up their hands. Tish Reynolds launched\n> Just Briefs, a maker of cheerleading practice wear, in 2005, and grew the\n> business to $3 million. But \u201cVarsity kept telling [customers] you\u2019ve got to\n> buy your uniforms from us,\u201d says Reynolds. Varsity acquired Just Briefs in\n> 2010 and closed it, even though it hired Reynolds as part of the deal.\n\nVarsity has such an entrenched competitive position that CNBC noted that it\n\u201cstands out as one of the few retail businesses of scale that may also have an\nAmazon defense.\u201d That\u2019s how powerful Varsity is, it\u2019s a retail brand that is\nnot even afraid of Amazon.\n\nFear, Safety, Political Control and Monopoly\n\nAs with nearly all monopoly power, Varsity also has imposed fear of\nretaliation across the industry.\n\n> \u201cVarsity has free rein,\u201d Kimberly Archie, founder of the National Cheer\n> Safety Foundation, said. Archie said she has tried to loosen Varsity\u2019s grip\n> on cheerleading by assisting plaintiff teams during personal injury claims\n> and even attempting to bring antitrust lawsuits against Varsity. But she\n> said she has been unable to get any current gym owners or cheerleaders to\n> testify against Varsity because they fear possible retaliation.\n>\n> \u201cVarsity has control over cheerleading at every level in the U.S. and\n> abroad,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no resistance.\u201d\n\nIn a glittery version of Google\u2019s financing of civil society groups focusing\non privacy, Varsity finances nonprofit associations associated with\ncheerleading, including the governing body that handles safety, the nonprofit\nAmerican Association of Cheerleading Coaches & Administrators. And it\naggressively lobbied to prevent cheerleading from being considered a sport so\nthat it could remain unregulated. (It\u2019s \u2018more than a sport\u2019 says Varsity.)\n\n> In one of Varsity\u2019s 2003 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission\n> (Varsity was briefly a public company), the company stated that recognition\n> of cheerleading as an official sport and the ensuing increased regulation\n> \u201cwould likely have a material adverse affect on Varsity\u2019s business,\n> financial condition and results of operations.\u201d\n>\n> Should cheerleading be more closely regulated, it could mean implementing\n> participation restrictions on teams and athletes, threatening Varsity\u2019s\n> competitions and its off-season camps, one of the company\u2019s most profitable\n> components.\n\nThere is one looming problem for Varsity. Last year, the NCAA, which controls\ncollege athletics, established a cheerleading-like sport called \u201cAcrobatics\nand Tumbling,\u201d and placed control of the sport not under Varsity but under\nscandal-ridden USA Gymnastics. In other words, the only thing that has stopped\nVarsity was another more powerful monopoly.\n\nSo there we have it all. Catastrophic injuries, rigged competitions, vertical\nforeclosure, private equity. Fixing this situation isn\u2019t that hard, and\nbasically requires a restoration of basic anti-monopoly principles, with\nglitter. That means stopping coercive rebates, ending long-term gym contracts,\nhaving competitions not controlled by Varsity, and regulating cheerleading\nlike a sport.\n\nOh, and there\u2019s one more thing. Cheerleading monopolist Jeff Webb, after\nselling his business to private equity, has entered politics. He now runs a\npro-Trump anti-immigrant political advocacy group called the New American\nPopulist, one of whose goals is to \u201cadvance our use of existing anti-trust\nlaws.\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t make this up. And what I love about studying monopoly is that you\nreally don\u2019t have to.\n\n##\n\nWhat I\u2019m Reading\n\nWells Fargo Attorney Moonlights as Buttigieg Campaign Policy Antitrust Adviser\n(The Prospect)\n\n\u2018I Honestly Don\u2019t Trust Many People at Boeing\u2019: A Broken Culture Exposed\n(Seattle Times)\n\nBeyond pilot trash talk, 737 MAX documents reveal how intensely Boeing focused\non cost (Seattle Times)\n\n\u2018Techlash\u2019 Hits College Campuses (New York Times)\n\nChinese Spyware Pre-Installed on All Samsung Phones (& Tablets), Reddit\n\nThanks for reading.
