The network is being built by SpaceX's Starshield\nbusiness unit under a $1.8 billion contract signed in 2021.\n\nWhile this network will be separate from SpaceX's Starlink Internet\nconstellation, the National Reconnaissance Office contract is leveraging\nSpaceX's capability to put a large number of Starlink satellites into orbit\nwith its existing manufacturing facilities and the reusable Falcon 9 rocket.\nThe current Starlink megaconstellation has more than 5,700 operational\nsatellites.\n\nThis spysat constellation is considered to be \"proliferated\" because there\nwill be swarms of satellites launched into low-Earth orbit to provide imaging\nand other capabilities, and these should be less vulnerable to enemy attack\nbecause of their large numbers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough no nation has ever attacked another nation's satellites, major space\npowers, including the United States, Russia, and China, are clearly working on\nsuch measures. A good reference for these efforts is the Secure World\nFoundation's annual Global Counterspace Capabilities report.\n\nIn its reporting, Reuters suggests that the high-quality imaging sensors on\nthe SpaceX satellites in low-Earth orbit will exceed the resolution of some of\nthe best US spy satellites at higher altitudes. They may also provide a\nsuperior alternative to the current use of drones and reconnaissance aircraft,\nwhich can be risky to fly in the airspace of other nations.\n\nThe first elements of this proliferated constellation are likely to launch\nnext month from Vandenberg Space Force Base on the NROL-146 mission. According\nto Troy Meink, the National Reconnaissance Office\u2019s principal deputy director,\nthis will be the first of as many as six such launches in 2024.\n\n\"This launch will be the first launch of an actual operational system,\" Meink\nsaid at the annual Space Symposium earlier this month. \"This system will\nincrease timeliness of access, diversity of communication paths and enhance\nour resilience.\"\n\n## An uneasy partnership\n\nTypically, in its 22 years of operation, SpaceX has eschewed deep partnerships\nwith traditional aerospace contractors, including Northrop Grumman. Early on,\nin fact, SpaceX had a legal confrontation with Northrop over the pintle engine\ninjector technology used in the Merlin rocket engine that powered the Falcon\n1, and later Falcon 9 rocket. SpaceX counter-sued, saying Northrop had abused\nits position in an advisory role in the Air Force to spy on SpaceX.\nEventually, the lawsuits were both dropped with no damages.\n\nMore than a decade later, SpaceX launched the \"Zuma\" satellite, an ultra-\nexpensive classified spacecraft valued in excess of $3 billion and built by\nNorthrop for the National Reconnaissance Office. The launch on a Falcon 9\nrocket was successful in January 2018, but the spacecraft was subsequently\nlost. The failure was later blamed on a payload adaptor supplied by Northrop\nGrumman, although this has never been publicly confirmed.\n\nIt is clearly hoped by US government officials that this collaboration between\nSpaceX and Northrop will meet a happier fate.\n\n#### reader comments\n\n45\n\nEric Berger Eric Berger is the senior space editor at Ars Technica, covering\neverything from astronomy to private space to wonky NASA policy, and author of\nthe book Liftoff, about the rise of SpaceX.
