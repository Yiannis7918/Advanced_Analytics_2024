It was a pivotal advancement\nin the mechanisation of weaving during the initial stages of the Industrial\nRevolution, and facilitated the weaving of considerably broader fabrics,\nenabling the production of wider textiles. Moreover, its mechanical\nimplementation paved the way for the introduction of automatic machine looms.\n\nThe brainchild of John Kay, the flying shuttle received a patent in the year\n1733. Its implementation brought about an acceleration of the previously\nmanual weaving process and resulted in a significant reduction in the required\nlabour force. Formerly, a broad-cloth loom necessitated the presence of a\nweaver on each side, but with the advent of the flying shuttle, a solitary\noperator could handle the task proficiently. Prior to this breakthrough, the\ntextile industry relied upon the coordination of four spinners to support a\nsingle weaver.\n\nThe widespread adoption of the flying shuttle by the 1750s dramatically\nexacerbated this labour imbalance, marking a notable shift in textile\nproduction dynamics.^[1]\n\n## History[edit]\n\nThe history of this device is difficult to accurately ascertain due to poor\nrecordings. Nonetheless, there are two general schools of thought around this;\nfirst those that believe that it appears to have been invented in the region\nof Languedoc of southern France (one year before its introduction in England),\nbut was destroyed by state cloth inspectors of the rent-seeking Ancien\nRegime.^[2] On the other side, are those that believe it simply originated\nwhere it was industrialized; England.\n\n## Operation[edit]\n\nHolding the reed beater bar in the left hand and the (stick-mounted) string\ntugged to return the flying shuttle in the right hand. See video below.\n\nIn a typical frame loom, as used previous to the invention of the flying\nshuttle, the operator sat with the newly woven cloth before them, using\ntreadles or some other mechanism to raise and lower the heddles, which opened\nthe shed in the warp threads. They then had to reach forward while holding the\nshuttle in one hand and pass this through the shed; the shuttle carried a\nbobbin for the weft. The shuttle then had to be caught in the other hand, the\nshed closed, and the beater pulled forward to push the weft into place. This\naction (called a \"pick\") required regularly bending forward over the fabric;\nmore importantly, the coordination between the throwing and catching of the\nshuttle required multiple operators if the width of the fabric exceeded that\nwhich could be reasonably reached across (typically 60 inches (150 cm) or\nless).\n\nThe flying shuttle employs a board, called the \"race,\" which runs, side to\nside, along the front of the beater, forming a track on which the shuttle\nruns. The lower threads of the shed rest on the track and the shuttle slides\nover them. At each end of the race, there is a box which catches the shuttle\nat the end of its journey, and which contains a mechanism for propelling the\nshuttle on its return trip.^[clarification needed] The shuttle itself has some\nsubtle differences from the older form. The ends of the shuttle are bullet-\nshaped and metal-capped, and the shuttle generally has rollers to reduce\nfriction. The weft thread is made to exit from the end rather than the side,\nand the thread is stored on a pirn (a long, conical, one-ended, non-turning\nbobbin) to allow it to feed more easily. Finally, the flying shuttle is\ngenerally somewhat heavier, so as to have sufficient momentum to carry it all\nthe way through the shed.\n\n  * Handloom with a flying shuttle. The shuttle runs in a shuttle race attached to the front of the (bottom-mounted) beater bar.\n\n  * Narrow tanmono loom with an obvious shuttle race on a top-mounted beater bar. Late 1800s Japan.\n\n  * This 1893 Yorkshire-made handloom has a flying shuttle; it is not just controlled but powered by the pedals.\n\n  * The fully-automated shuttle moves almost too fast to see.\n\n  * An early fully-automated loom. The arms at the sides can be seen swinging to bash the flying shuttle back and forth.\n\n## Social effects[edit]\n\nThe increase in production due to the flying shuttle exceeded the capacity of\nthe spinning industry of the day and prompted the development of powered\nspinning machines. Beginning with the spinning jenny and the waterframe until\nultimately culminating in the spinning mule, which could produce strong, fine\nthread in the quantities needed^[3]^[4] these innovations transformed the\ntextile industry in Great Britain. The innovation was seen as a threat to the\nlivelihood of spinners & weavers, which resulted in an uprising that had Kay's\npatent largely ignored. It is often incorrectly written that Kay was attacked\nand fled to France, but in fact he simply moved there to attempt to rent out\nhis looms, a business model that had failed him in England.^[5]\n\nThe flying shuttle produced a new source of injuries to the weaving process;\nif deflected from its path, it could be shot clear of the machine, potentially\nstriking and injuring workers. Turn-of-the-century injury reports abound with\ninstances in which eyes were lost or other injuries sustained and, in several\ninstances (for example, an extended exchange in 1901), the British House of\nCommons was moved to take up the issue of installing guards and other\ncontrivances to reduce these injuries.^[6]\n\n## Obsolescence[edit]\n\nSee also: Loom \u00a7 Weft insertion\n\nThe flying shuttle dominated commercial weaving through the middle of the\ntwentieth century. However, by that time, other systems had begun to replace\nit. The heavy shuttle was noisy and energy-inefficient (since the energy used\nto throw it was largely lost in the catching); also, its inertia limited the\nspeed of the loom. Projectile and rapier looms eliminated the need to take the\nbobbin/pirn of thread through the shed; later, air- and water-jet looms\nreduced the weight of moving parts further. Flying shuttle looms are still\nused for some purposes, and old models remain in use.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"History of technology\". www.historyworld.net.
