Having the logic [chip]\nfoundry in the US and then a bit of the packaging there is not enough,\u201d said\nMyron Xie, an analyst at boutique consultancy SemiAnalysis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTSMC\u2014which makes chips under contract at hugely complex and expensive\nfabrication plants, or fabs\u2014plans to start manufacturing 2-nanometer chips in\nthe US in 2028. This is an upgrade from the company\u2019s previous plans. At that\ntime 2 nm technology is expected to be the latest in mass production\nworldwide, whereas previously the company had intended each new US fab to\nstart operating with process technology one generation behind Taiwan.\n\nTSMC has also committed to offer a third plant using 2 nm or even newer\ntechnology by 2030.\n\nWashington is paying a hefty price for the upgrade, with US$6.6 billion in\ngrants and up to $5 billion in loans for TSMC. The money comes from the 2022\nChips and Science Act, which aims to onshore advanced chipmaking for the US.\nCommerce secretary Gina Raimondo has said the US will be on track to make\nabout 20 percent of the world\u2019s most advanced chips by the end of the decade.\n\nBut while Washington\u2019s money offers some incentive, TSMC\u2019s most important\nmotive for stepping up its commitment to the US was to bring its own US\nstrategy in line with the needs of Nvidia and other vendors of the AI chips\nthat have become the most potent driver of global semiconductor demand.\n\nEnlarge\n\nFT\n\nWhile TSMC will kick off 2 nm volume production in Taiwan next year, its\noriginal plans would have offered less powerful 3 nm chips only from 2028 in\nthe US, putting it years behind the AI chip cycle, analysts said.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How Scientists Respond to Science Deniers\n\n#### reader comments\n\n28\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### Channel Ars Technica\n\n#### SITREP: F-16 replacement search a signal of F-35 fail?\n\nFootage courtesy of Dvids, Boeing, and The United States Navy.\n\n  * ##### SITREP: F-16 replacement search a signal of F-35 fail?\n\n  * ##### Sitrep: Boeing 707\n\n  * ##### Steve Burke of GamersNexus Reacts To Their Top 1000 Comments On YouTube\n\n  * ##### Scott Manley Reacts To His Top 1000 YouTube Comments\n\n  * ##### LGR's Clint Basinger Reacts To His Top 1000 YouTube Comments\n\n  * ##### How Forza's Racing AI Uses Neural Networks To Evolve\n\n  * ##### The F-35's next tech upgrade\n\n  * ##### Fighter Pilot Breaks Down Every Button in an F-15 Cockpit\n\n  * ##### Linus \"Tech Tips\" Sebastian Reacts to His Top 1000 YouTube Comments\n\n  * ##### Customizing Mini 4WD Racers For High Speeds On A Small Scale\n\n  * ##### MegaBots: Born to Smash Anything in Their Path\n\n  * ##### First Look: Xbox Adaptive Controller\n\n  * ##### Quantum Computing Expert Explains One Concept in 5 Levels of Difficulty\n\n  * ##### Kids versus 80s tech: Game Boy, Vectrex and a stereo system\n\n  * ##### Expert Explains One Concept in 5 Levels of Difficulty - Blockchain\n\n  * ##### Best wearable tech of 2017\n\n  * ##### The Moov HR Sweat - heart rate monitor in a headband | Ars Technica\n\nMore videos\n\n\u2190 Previous story Next story \u2192\n\n### Related Stories\n\n### Today on Ars\n\nCNMN Collection WIRED Media Group \u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
