In an omen of what Western automakers will need to contend with, it's\nnow launched a futuristic luxury coupe with a next-gen battery pack and crab-\nwalking capability.\n\nThe high-density lithium batteries we enjoy today were an absolute\ntechnological revolution. They blew rechargeable nickel-cadmium and nickel-\nmetal-hydride batteries out of the water, offering such a leap in energy\nstorage by weight and volume that suddenly all sorts of things became\npossible.\n\nMore Stories\n\nAutomotive\n\n8-seat mini-camper shifts instantly from MPV to RV via stackable pods\n\nMarine\n\nABB's cycloidal marine propellers: Efficient thrust in any direction\n\n### We recommend\n\nPowered by\n\n  * Targeting settings\n  * Do not sell my personal information\n  * Google Analytics settings\n\nSmartphones, all-day laptops, drones, electric cars, skateboards, motorcycles,\nscooters, electric aircraft, eVTOLs, ebikes... Suddenly, you could carry\nenough energy in a safe, reliable, high-input, high-output format that all\nthese ideas became (or are becoming) world-changing products at an epic scale.\n\nBut of course, as amazing as anything is in the modern world, we quickly find\nthe new limits and start getting annoyed about them. Solid-state batteries are\namong a number of contenders for the title of \"next big thing\" in the battery\nworld, promising another leap forward in energy density. Their solid\nelectrolytes theoretically allow them to store much more energy per weight and\nvolume than the liquids in conventional batteries, as well as being\npotentially safer and operating much better in sub-zero temperatures.\n\nFloor-mounted battery pack is a semi-solid state 130-kWh beauty with long-\nrange and fast-charging capabilities\n\nIM Motors\n\nThe issues delaying solid-state packs from mass adoption have been around\npower density \u2013 how hard you can run them and how fast you can charge them \u2013\nas well as cost, durability and cycle life; the range of boxes you need to\ntick for a useful mass-market battery is pretty crazy. Still, EV manufacturers\nare very eager to get these things happening; Honda, Nissan and Toyota in\nparticular have oriented their future plans around the idea.\n\nBut China has taken a big bite out of getting these things up and running\nright now, at ludicrous Chinese scale and prices. The debut comes as part of\nthe all-new IM L6 sedan, a rolling engineering lab loaded with the most\nbleeding-edge technologies IM \u2013 and parent company SAIC \u2013 have at their\ndisposal.\n\nIM calls the battery pack in question \"Lightyear\" and offers it as the power\nsource for the \u00a5330,000 (approx. US$45,600) flagship L6 Lightyear Max. It's\nnot a strictly zero-fluid solid-state chemistry, instead utilizing a semi-\nsolid layout that includes solid material suspended in a liquid electrolyte.\nIt's a step toward the solid-state future, though.\n\nFour wheel steering for superb maneuverability\n\nIM Motors\n\nThe 900-V Lightyear pack has a capacity of 130 kWh for a total range estimated\nto exceed 1,000 km (620 miles) on China's CLTC testing cycle. Just as\nimpressively, it's said to be capable of adding 400 km (249 miles) of range in\njust 12 minutes when wired up to a properly quick ultra-fast charger.\n\nBeyond those range-topping power cells, the L6 has its foundation on a new\ndigital chassis with multi-system Vehicle Motion Control. China likes its cars\nwith cartoon-like motion capability, and the digital chassis rolls together\nfour-wheel steering, intelligent electronic damping, air suspension, and\nadditional hardware to enable moves like crab-walking tight corners and\ndiagonally sliding in place of parallel parking.\n\nIt's a nice-looking thing, with a futuristic white interior and expansive\ntouch screens all competing for your grubby finger smudges. The exterior sends\na few nods and winks towards Germany and Korea. It's a tidy and fun-looking\ndesign.\n\nTidy white interior\n\nIM Motors\n\nIt's also less than US$32,000 (RMB 230,000) as a starting price, and around\nUS$45,000 (RMB 330,000) when fully decked out with the fancy battery in the L6\nMax Lightyear Edition. Those are Chinese prices, obviously, but they\nillustrate the enormous advantages of scale and cheap labor that China wields.\nWith a colossal domestic market to address, that's where a lot of the focus is\ngoing. But nobody can do scale like China, and cars like the L6 give a glimpse\nof the formidable competition the rest of the world needs to prepare for.\n\nSource: IM Motors\n\nView gallery - 6 images\n\n## Tags\n\nAutomotiveElectric VehiclesSolid-stateBattery+Electric+VehicleChinaBattery\nTechnology\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Flipboard\n  * LinkedIn\n\n10 comments\n\nC.C.

The company web\nsite doesn't have a compact comparison chart for features of the three\nversions. No info in the article about how much Chinese-government subsidy\nallows such low sales prices for these features. Battery longevity/warranty\nwould be a key factor. As the article says, it's a test bed.\n\ngybognarjr April 11, 2024 09:11 AM\n\nMeanwhile Ford and GM would not even consider to set up an alliance to develop\nand manufacture affordable electric cars. Alone, they will not be able to\ncatch up with China and South Korea, even if they would be racing towards\nthem.\n\nRobt April 11, 2024 09:20 AM\n\nThose prices aren\u2019t due to scale (there is none at this stage), or cheap\nlabour, as manufacturers have been fleeing China for years now due to elevated\ncosts of labour. They are entirely predatory; designed to set the stage for\noverseas sales at ruinously low prices to attack overseas auto companies who\nare already struggling in the electric car arena.\n\nTechGazer April 11, 2024 09:50 AM\n\n\" Their solid electrolytes can theoretically store much more energy than the\nliquids in conventional batteries,\" Electrolytes don't store energy; the\nelectrodes do. Less electrolyte volume or mass would improve the respective\nenergy densities.\n\nmartinwinlow April 12, 2024 05:34 AM\n\nWhy this *truly* ludicrous obsession with ridiculously long range? The average\ncar does little more than 30 miles *a day*. Even for those (unfortunate)\nenough to have to do hundreds of miles a day, we all still need to eat and...\nother things. If we are that sort of driver, taking an hour over lunch and\ncatching up on your emails, etc is not exactly a crazy notion, nor time that\nany reasonable person would consider to be 'wasted' whilst charging.\n\nA huge battery is going to come with an equally huge price tag and if you only\nrarely need to be able to do more than 300 miles at one sitting, why fork out\nall that extra money only for it to cost you *even more* through all the\nwasted energy and wear&tear on the drive train (and tyres) accelerating and\ndecelerating all that necessary extra weight day-in, day-out? So, what's the\npoint of having an EV with more than 300 miles of range... for just about\n*anyone*?!\n\nRic April 12, 2024 05:42 AM\n\nWhat Robt said, and also, cheap labor is going to seem expensive compared to\nthe free labor humanoid robotics is going to bring, and it\u2019s not that far down\nthe pipeline. A vast destitute population willing to work for inhumane prices\n(and under inhumane conditions) will not be much of an advantage for very much\nlonger...\n\nWhite Rabbit April 12, 2024 08:25 AM\n\n@martinwinlow - It's 1736 km to my cottage. In my ancient ICE vehicle it takes\nless than 18 hours, including 3 pit stops. Were I driving a Tesla Model Y\n(with approximately the same range per \"fill up\") the 3 stops would add 15-18\nHOURS to the trip, according to www.tesla.com. That's providing I could find a\nplace to plug in! For every hour the vehicle is driving, it takes hour to\ncharge. Imagine if it took as long to fill the gas tank as it does to use the\nfuel. I can't imagine lounging over lunch for 5-6 hours, 3 times in one trip!!\nEither range needs to extended, or charge times significantly reduced (in the\nreal world - not a fantasy in which there are as many 440V charge stations as\ngas stations) for EVs to be useful to just about any highway user.\n\nguzmanchinky April 12, 2024 10:12 AM\n\nI'd rather have a much lighter car that goes 300 miles with this tech. And if\nMurica keeps going on about how EV's aren't as good as loud V8s, every car we\ndrive will say \"Made in China\", just like every piece of electronic equipment\nwe all now own...\n\nAross April 14, 2024 09:49 AM\n\nI agree with Whit Rabbit. Until batteries are easily replaceable when the ware\nout or fail and rechargeable in 15 minutes or less an EV is useless for my\nneeds.\n\n## GET OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nOver 220,000 people receive our email newsletter.
