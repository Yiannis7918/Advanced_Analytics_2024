And in this desert, where logically\nnothing should happen, here humanity made its most important steps in\ndevelopment.\n\nIn the beginning there was ... natron\n\nNatron is a kind of salt which is abundant in the Nile valley. People have\nbeen hand-picking and collecting it in baskets since ancient times. Ancient\nEgyptians used natron for at least ten different purposes:\n\n  * Washing clothes, drying food, medical treatment, mouthwashing, ceramics, textile dyeing, insepticide, conserve papyrus, cosmetic and...\n  * Mummification, of course\n\nOh, and one more thing!\n\nNatron was also used to create glass. So called \"natron glass\", which is still\nthe most common format of glass we use today. In fact, this happened way\nbefore the Egyptians even dreamed of having an empire. Between 5000 and 4000\nBC they already created small glass amulets and glass beads*.\n\n*Badarian culture\n\nWhat is glass, and why is it important?\n\nNatron glass is nothing more than natron, sand and limestone \"cooked\" together\non 851 degrees Celsius. Which means Egyptians were able to melt natron since\nthe beginning of time**.\n\n**It's a - so called - \"fact\"\n\nNow tell me straight to my face, are you seriously saying that normal, healthy\nancient men didn't try melting stones with molten natron, but only bothered\nwith sand?\n\nOf course they tried! And what did they find?\n\nThey found a bunch of dominos that can be knocked over\n\nDominos like \"granite being so hard that it can't be damaged by any everyday\nchemical\" or how our ancestors transported stone blocks weighing several\nhundred tons over hundreds of miles.\n\n...and the rest is history.
