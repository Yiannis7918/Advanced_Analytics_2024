In many ways, this past month has been one of\nthe most unique times in my personal life as well as on the world stage. The\nworld is wrought with anguish at the genocide that\u2019s happening right now by\nthe Zionist European settler-colonial state of Israel against the Palestinian\npeople. In many ways, this has been the focal point for Muslims around the\nworld, as nary a talk, event, khutbah (sermon), fundraiser, or even social\nmedia posting can go by without mentioning what\u2019s happening in the Holy Land.\n\nThat said, on a more personal note, this Ramadan has been a struggle as well,\nbut not because of difficult fasting. Rather, on the personal level, I have\nfound myself struggling to balance the various aspects of my life. What I\u2019ve\ncome to realize is that this may be due to the fact that I am in a major state\nof transition in my own life. While I will spare you all the details here\npublicly, my family is preparing for a big move and most of the heavy lifting\n(literally and metaphorically) has been happening during this month of\nRamadan. What I\u2019ve found in myself during these times, upon reflection, is\nthat, even as I have eclipsed (haha, if you know, you know) 43 years of life,\nI am discovering more-and-more about myself, and not all of it is roses.\n\nOn top of the natural changes that happen as you get older (things just don\u2019t\nwork the way they used to, you can\u2019t do the same things as when you were\nyounger, etc.), I am also finding out that what I used to think were positive\ntraits of my own personal character were, rather, just blank spaces of\nexperience where I hadn\u2019t really gone through any hardships or tests. In other\nwords, to put it simply, I thought I was a \u201cgood person\u201d because I was able to\nmaintain a good attitude when life was seemingly on \u201ceasy mode\u201d. In fact, I\ncan\u2019t even say that life has gotten harder, but rather, my own veneer of good\nattitude has been peeling away. I cannot maintain the same happy-go-lucky\nattitude of blissful ignorance I once had when I was younger, and I am\nstruggling with adapting to this new norm.\n\nThe ugliness I\u2019ve seen, and become aware of, in life, over the past decade or\nso, and not a small part of it the enormous hypocrisy and disregard by the\nWestern world for the well-being or even humanity of the people of Palestine,\nhas taken a huge mental toll on me. And I will readily admit that I have not\nbeen perfect about not allowing that to affect other parts of my life. It is\nin this weakness and failure that I have been the most disappointed in myself.\n\nBut, I will say that I am grateful to at least recognize it. I believe that,\namong other things, I have tended towards being self-aware enough to know when\nI am doing something wrong or when I am going through something that affects\nhow I behave, and I usually can recognize when I\u2019ve done something wrong, if\nnot before I do, at least after. It gives me a chance to at least apologize\nand/or make amends. I generally am comfortable with admitting when I\u2019ve made a\nmistake, even to my wife and kids, and I believe this is a great virtue to\nhave. I\u2019m not saying I get it right all the time, but I know too that I am not\noblivious to it.\n\nI say all of this to highlight that I\u2019ve also recognized that my character and\nmanners are not where I thought they used to be. Having said that, I believe\nthat this also means it\u2019s a great time for the transition that my family & I\nare working on. We\u2019ve lived where we live now for close to 10 years, and we\u2019ve\nexperienced a lot of good, and some bad, but the good has been overwhelmingly\nmore than the bad, for sure. But, we also recognize that, well, part of our\ndissatisfaction may be due to the fact that it\u2019s time to move on.\n\nI traveled with my wife in March to another city, and what I experienced there\nwas something that hearkened back to an era I remember fondly. I felt that\nwarmth and glow that I once did when I was younger, and that\u2019s what woke me up\nto the idea that, maybe that youthful energy, optimism, and drive are still\nthere, and, in fact, have less to do with youth and more to do with finding\nthe context in which it can thrive. I found acts of worship there easier,\nconnecting with people easier, and even the experience with my wife was full\nof so many positives, it felt like a second honeymoon, alhamdulillaah.\n\nI have a lot more to say, but I already feel I\u2019m so far off any clear topic\nthat I\u2019ll wrap it up here, but I will say that, for me, I believe I am at\npoint in my life where transitioning to a new location can offer me a much-\nneeded reset so that I can recalibrate and come back into a mode of service\nand Islamic work that I\u2019ve not felt for a long time.\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\n### Find it\n\n### Tags\n\nadministration (2) amd (1) baby (2) blessing (2) Blog (2) cli (2) coding (2)\ncoronavirus (2) database (2) development (5) devops (2) employment (2) Fedora\n(10) freedom (4) Free Software (10) fun (2) gnu/linux (3) hacking (2) hdr (2)\nhorror (1) humor (2) hunting (1) innodb (1) journey (2) laravel (3) lekhonee\n(2) linux (4) new job (2) open source (2) palestine (3) php (2) plugin (1)\nprogramming (1) qtpfsgui (2) release (5) screen (2) server (1) story (2)\nstrikeforgaza (2) tech (2) tip (1) update (3) web development (2) WordPress\n(7) work (2)\n\n### Blogs\n\n  * ahmed el-helw\u2019s blog\n  * Wikimedia Technical Blog\n  * xiphmont\n\n### Development\n\n  * MariaDB\n  * PHP\n\n### My Regular Reads\n\n  * Astronomy Picture of the Day\n  * Hacker News\n\n### Meta\n\n  * Log in\n  * Entries feed\n  * Comments feed\n  * WordPress.org\n\nApril 2024M| T| W| T| F| S| S  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7  \n8| 9| 10| 11| 12| 13| 14  \n15| 16| 17| 18| 19| 20| 21  \n22| 23| 24| 25| 26| 27| 28  \n29| 30  \n  \n### Archives\n\n  * April 2024 (1)\n  * December 2023 (2)\n  * September 2023 (3)\n  * April 2020 (2)\n  * March 2020 (1)\n  * January 2020 (3)\n  * November 2019 (1)\n  * October 2019 (4)\n  * July 2019 (1)\n  * May 2019 (2)\n  * October 2018 (1)\n  * September 2018 (3)\n  * August 2018 (4)\n  * July 2018 (1)\n  * June 2018 (1)\n  * March 2018 (3)\n  * November 2013 (1)\n  * March 2012 (1)\n  * November 2011 (1)\n  * December 2010 (1)\n  * November 2010 (1)\n  * October 2010 (1)\n  * August 2010 (1)\n  * May 2010 (2)\n  * March 2010 (1)\n  * August 2009 (4)\n  * July 2009 (3)\n  * June 2009 (3)\n  * April 2009 (2)\n  * March 2009 (4)\n  * February 2009 (6)\n  * January 2009 (8)\n  * December 2008 (4)\n  * November 2008 (7)\n  * October 2008 (2)\n  * September 2008 (2)\n  * August 2008 (5)\n  * July 2008 (2)\n  * June 2008 (4)\n  * May 2008 (10)\n  * April 2008 (5)\n  * March 2008 (3)\n  * February 2008 (1)\n  * January 2008 (2)\n  * December 2007 (2)\n  * November 2007 (4)\n  * October 2007 (2)\n  * September 2007 (1)\n  * August 2007 (4)\n  * July 2007 (1)\n  * June 2007 (2)\n  * March 2007 (3)\n  * February 2007 (4)\n  * January 2007 (6)\n  * December 2006 (3)\n  * November 2006 (4)\n  * October 2006 (8)\n  * September 2006 (2)\n  * August 2006 (2)\n  * July 2006 (2)\n  * June 2006 (2)\n  * May 2006 (6)\n  * April 2006 (4)\n  * March 2006 (4)\n  * February 2006 (3)\n  * January 2006 (4)\n\n#### Find It\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 .
