Jones\n\n## June 6, 2023\n\nMy grandfather died this year, but you wouldn\u2019t know it. In fact, he preferred\nyou didn\u2019t. Ray Harrell came up as the youngest of eight in the Cataloochee\nValley in the 1930s \u2014 outrunning mountain lions and driving cattle off the\nmountain and crashing borrowed jeeps \u2014 and on January 20, nine decades later,\nhe passed from this earth without a sound. That\u2019s how he wanted it. You won\u2019t\nfind a headstone. Nobody gathered for a funeral. He was here, sitting on that\nporch he shared with his wife of nearly 70 years, and then he wasn\u2019t. Dust to\ndust.\n\nI was driving home after a day of teaching when Grandma called me. The cancer\nslowly draining him of life for the past year had held him in bed that\nmorning, and it seemed he would stay there for the rest of his life.\n\n\u201cWould you write your papaw\u2019s obituary?\u201d she asked, ever practical even amid\nthe loss of the love of her life.\n\nThere was plenty to tell. He\u2019d stolen a school bus as a teenager and backed it\nover a teacher\u2019s car. He\u2019d been shipped to Germany with the Army in 1950,\nwhere he flew up the ranks despite accidentally firing artillery through an\nempty house. He\u2019d led the union at the textile mill where he worked most of\nhis life. But he never talked much about any of that. What he set out to do\nwas build a small life in Fruitland, North Carolina, to raise up his daughters\nand do the dishes and fix the broken garage door. He set out to live quietly \u2014\nand then pass away just the same.\n\nWhen I sat down to write, I found myself dropping details into a template \u2014\nson of, survived by. The obituary form puts a particular pressure on what\nmatters, on what should be remembered and praised, but what does one say about\na life that aimed to carry on in the background, that had no interest in a\nname in newsprint or an award on the mantel? Ray Harrell, son of Jim and Cora,\nwas content to sit still and watch the breeze scatter the leaves? Ray Harrell,\nsergeant first class, arranged the bills in his wallet in descending order?\nRay Harrell, survived by Grace, whistled the same invented tune year after\nyear while searching for the right nail in the shed? I filled in the expected\ndetails and sent the obituary to the newspaper, but I knew it wasn\u2019t right. It\ncaptured nothing of the life he lived. What I returned to in the days after he\npassed, as the ladies from church covered the table in casseroles and Grandma\nslept in a bed alone for the first time since she was 19, was the sheer\naudacity of a quiet life.\n\n> Ray Harrell after a day driving a laundry truck. His bride, Grace, snapped\n> the photo outside their first house.\n\nWhen the notable figures of our day pass away, they wind up on our screens,\nshort clips documenting their achievements, talking heads discussing their\ninfluence. The quiet lives, though, pass on soundlessly in the background. And\nyet those are the lives in our skin, guiding us from breakfast to bed. They\u2019re\nthe lives that have made us, that keep the world turning.\n\nThey\u2019re taking out the trash before we notice and walking up the road to see\nif the mail\u2019s come. They\u2019re showing us how to lay out the biscuit dough at\njust the right thickness. They took our sons up on the tractor on spring\nafternoons. They helped the neighbor with the busted sink. They jumped in the\nriver to pull an 18-month-old out. They caught the man who\u2019d been pinned by\nthe forklift, his back broken, and held him as he died. They slipped money\ninto their nephew\u2019s pocket when he hadn\u2019t a penny to his name but was too\nashamed to admit it. They did the laundry. They swept the floor. They played\nin the yard like a kid. They ate a pack of saltines and climbed into bed night\nafter night until there were no more nights, only all the people left behind\nwho\u2019d carry on living because making a little life on a piece of land off\nFruitland Road is about the holiest thing we can think of.\n\nAll around us are these lives \u2014 heads down and arms open \u2014 that ignore the\nsiren call of flashy American individualism, of bright lights and center\nstage. I\u2019m fine right here is the response from the edge of the room, and that\ncontentment is downright subversive. How could you want only that? the world\ndemands. There\u2019s more to have, always more.\n\nThe newlyweds pose outside of Grace's childhood home in Fruitland, north\ncarolina. The home stood across the road from where Ray and Grace built their\nhouse \u2014 and lives \u2014 together.\n\nWhat Ray Harrell had was a reliable tractor and a fiery woman. He had a pat of\ncornbread waiting at noon dinner and an RC Cola every night before bed. He had\nkids and grandkids and great-grandkids enough to fill the house every\nChristmas. And that was plenty. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a good life,\u201d he said to me nearly\nevery time I visited in his final year, and I knew it to be true even if it\nmight have seemed odd from a distance. On paper, this small life above Clear\nCreek should have left a long list of regrets, of what ifs. But this life was\nthe life, the very thing he and my grandmother Grace set out to make when they\nmarried in the little church up the road in 1954.\n\nOn those visits, I settled down with the cornbread and asked for stories. Over\ntime, I collected histories I\u2019d never known. I learned of the stolen school\nbus and the crashed jeeps and the cow he got stuck in the mud. I learned of\nPapaw winning big playing cards while stationed in Germany during the Korean\nWar, and then taking his earnings and traveling all across Europe. I learned\nof him being fired \u2014 over and over \u2014 from the textile mill.\n\n\u201cHow come?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cWell, because I was aggravating, I guess.\u201d\n\nThat was right, mostly. He said no when no one wanted to hear it, rallied the\nunion when the bosses didn\u2019t want to see it. Like when they told him to climb\n10 feet without a harness and swap out a roller by himself. \u201cI told them I\nwasn\u2019t a-gonna do it.\u201d They fired him, the union lawyers stepped in, and he\ncame back to work.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a stubborn old man,\u201d Grandma said.\n\nMaybe that was right, too, but as I pieced together these stories of seeing\nthe world and fighting back against injustice, I realized that a quiet life\nisn\u2019t a passive life. Sitting still on the porch doesn\u2019t mean letting the\nworld go by. He and Grandma took their camper across the country. He served as\npresident of the union. Being content doesn\u2019t mean being blind. It means\nknowing the difference between a good fight and a selfish one.\n\n\u201cI believe in standing up for what is right,\u201d he said between bites of corn.\n\u201cAnd I oughtn\u2019t say this, but everybody liked me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Grandma asked.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have thought you\u2019d have to ask that. I\u2019m a good old boy.\u201d\n\n> The best time of his life was when his girls were little, Ray said as he\n> neared the end. He and Grace raised two daughters: Joy (pictured left) and\n> Debbie.\n\nWhat I\u2019ll miss most is the sound of his voice, cooked up in the North Carolina\nmountains out of remnants from across an ocean. There always thar, fire always\nfar. I loved the phrase ever which a\u2019way but loose. Loved how things liked to\nhappen. How hello was what do you say and how being still meant setting\nawhile.\n\nEven his voice was quiet, throaty and clipped in the way of men in these\nmountains \u2014 a voice meant for conversations beyond a crowd, meant for the\ngroup of men eyeing the door, aiming to be outside where it\u2019d be easier to\ntalk about nothing or just as soon not talk at all.\n\nHe could go hours without saying a word, but a flash of wit always waited on\nhis tongue. For nearly 70 years he kept up a constant, good-natured banter\nwith Grandma over anything and everything.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t rightly remember,\u201d she said on one of my story-seeking visits.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting too old to remember all that, woman.\u201d\n\n\u201cI surely am.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know the feeling.\u201d\n\nA month before he passed, faded and worn down to a wheelchair, his head still\npopped up when Grandma walked into the kitchen: \u201cHey thar, pretty girl.\u201d\n\nThe morning after Grandma called me, I took my boys by to see Papaw for the\nlast time. He\u2019d been unresponsive for a day, but when we entered the bedroom,\nhe was awake again. He couldn\u2019t find his voice \u2014 he\u2019d been breathing through\nhis mouth, and his throat was too dry to speak up \u2014 so I leaned in. He looked\nto my sons and said, \u201cHey, fellers.\u201d\n\nThey waved.\n\n\u201cI love you,\u201d I told him.\n\n\u201cLove you, buddy,\u201d he whispered.\n\n\u201cYou done good,\u201d I said because that\u2019s how he would\u2019ve said it, but also\nbecause that\u2019s how I meant it. He\u2019d done so much good, even if it couldn\u2019t be\nlisted on official records or captured in the stat sheet of an obituary. The\ngood of his life was ever-rippling water, quiet and steady, and my boys and I\nwould long be swept up in it.\n\n> Jeremy B.
