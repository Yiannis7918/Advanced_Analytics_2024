Now, a year and a half after Parker\u2019s death, Sparhawk\nis back on the road.\n\nBy Justin Taylor\n\nApril 11, 2024\n\nPhotographs by Jenn Ackerman and Tim Gruber for The New Yorker\n\nLast winter, I flew to Minneapolis to hear a funk quartet play at a bar. The\nweather was miserable: hard-frozen snowbanks in every gutter, skating-rink\nsidewalks, roads so ripped up by rock salt and plow blades that I had to\nreturn my first rental car, because it shook like a leaf if I took it above\nthirty. I had come to see the band Derecho (since rechristened the Derecho\nRhythm Section), the newest project of Alan Sparhawk, who for three decades\nfronted the seminal indie-rock band Low, which he co-founded with his wife,\nMimi Parker.\n\nSparhawk had grown his hair out during the pandemic, and the red-blond mane\nwas still shaggy past his shoulders. He wore work boots, a black T-shirt,\nbrown overalls, and a black beanie that came off as the room warmed up. As in\nLow, he plays guitar and sings lead. Cyrus Sparhawk, his and Parker\u2019s\nnineteen-year-old son, plays bass and writes much of the music. On this icy\nnight, the Sparhawk boys\u2014abetted by Al Church and Izzy Cruz on\npercussion\u2014served up two piping-hot sets of Roy Ayers, Parliament-Funkadelic,\nand Childish Gambino covers, alongside a handful of original compositions.\n\nThe audience numbered perhaps fifty people, including several dancing couples\nand two bootleggers, whose taping rigs sat on their tables, beside their\nchicken wings. Sparhawk noted their presence with bemusement but without\nconcern. The music was tight, buoyant, punk-inflected, and exploratory enough\nto explain what the tapers were doing there. Between songs, Sparhawk joked\nabout the band being willing to play weddings and bar mitzvahs\u2014any gig that\npaid. It was a happy, high-spirited show, but there was unspoken sorrow in the\nair.\n\nLow was supposed to have reached its thirtieth anniversary in 2023. The band\u2019s\npast few albums had been critical hits. A pandemic-era live-from-home concert\nseries had deepened the connection to old fans and won over a legion of new\nones. Cyrus, Parker and Sparhawk\u2019s younger child, had come of age. Low should\nhave been out on tour, taking well-deserved victory laps across the U.S. and\nEurope, claiming its rightful place in the indie-rock pantheon alongside the\nlikes of Pavement, Sleater-Kinney, and Yo La Tengo. But there was no more Low.\nIn late 2020, Mimi Parker had been given a diagnosis of ovarian cancer. After\na brutal two-year struggle, she died on November 5, 2022. She was fifty-five\nyears old. As Parker and Sparhawk themselves sing in uncanny harmony on the\nfirst single from Low\u2019s 2021 album, \u201cHey What,\u201d \u201cWhen you think you\u2019ve seen\neverything / You find we\u2019re living in days like these.\u201d\n\nAlan Sparhawk and Mimi Parker were childhood friends turned high-school\nsweethearts turned longtime artistic collaborators. Across four decades,\nthirteen albums, five bass players, and two children\u2014through Sparhawk\u2019s semi-\npublic struggles with mental illness and addiction in the early two-thousands,\nas well as Parker\u2019s more recent and more private illness\u2014they produced one of\nthe most singular bodies of music in the history of rock. Low\u2019s sound is\nsolemn, sometimes glacial, with elliptical lyrics that often touch on\nquestions of faith. (Sparhawk was raised Mormon; Parker converted before they\nmarried.) The band\u2019s music demands patience and attention, which it repays in\nbeauty and transcendence, punctuated by occasional bursts of earworm jangle-\npop or cathartic, pummelling storms of noise.\n\nSharon Van Etten first heard Low in 1999, when one of the first friends she\nmade at college played Low\u2019s record \u201cSecret Name\u201d for her in her dorm room.\n\u201cThey are so deceptively simple,\u201d she said. \u201cI could feel their love and their\npain.\u201d Michael Hadreas, who performs as Perfume Genius, spoke of the band\u2019s\n\u201chymnal quality.\u201d \u201cThere was a warmth to it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it was also really\nfucked up. The music is kind of fucked. And dark. That\u2019s comforting to me,\nthat those all exist at the same time.\u201d\n\nRilke writes in \u201cDuino Elegies\u201d that \u201cbeauty is nothing but the beginning of\nterror\u201d and that it is on this account that \u201cevery angel is terrifying.\u201d I\u2019ve\nthought of Rilke often while listening to Low, because so much of the band\u2019s\nwork explores divine love, dissolving the border between awe and fear. In\n\u201cNothing But Heart,\u201d from the album \u201cC\u2019mon\u201d (2011), Sparhawk, adopting what I\ntake to be the persona of God, sings, \u201cI would be your king / But you want to\nbe free / Confusion and art / I\u2019m nothing but heart.\u201d That last line is\nrepeated at least twenty times, with Parker harmonizing, in the next several\nminutes, while the music builds to a whirlwind roar. The song is at once\nopenhanded and gnomic, elegant and menacing. It\u2019s the song that converted\nme\u2014at a 2011 concert at Terminal 5, in New York City\u2014from a casual, even\ndismissive listener to an ardent fan. When the band kicked into \u201cNothing But\nHeart,\u201d I felt the nature and depth of my attention shift. It was as though\nthe music were a long-locked door to which I\u2019d finally found a key\u2014or, better,\nas if I contained a long-locked door, which the music had finally pried open.\n\nSparhawk and Parker met on the second day of fourth grade in Clearbrook,\nMinnesota, a hardscrabble town of fewer than five hundred people. He was the\nnew kid: his family had relocated from Utah because his father had bought a\nfarm, pursuing what Sparhawk described to me as a \u201cMormon version of \u2018back to\nthe land\u2019 \u201d for which the family was woefully ill-equipped. (Per the refrain\nof Low\u2019s \u201cCalifornia\u201d: \u201cThough it breaks your heart / we had to sell the\nfarm.\u201d) Parker also lived on a farm, and music ran in both families. Her\nmother had tried to break into country music, and her father sang around the\nhouse. Parker learned to sing by harmonizing with her older sisters.\nSparhawk\u2019s mother played church organ, and his father wrote songs and played\ndrums in a country band. \u201cIf it were up to him, he played jazz,\u201d Sparhawk\nsaid, \u201cbut, because of where we lived, that was the gig he could get. For a\nwhile, that was the only cash he made.\u201d\n\nIn Clearbrook, alcoholism was rampant and violence commonplace. In a 2021\ninterview, Parker said that the song \u201cLaser Beam,\u201d which she wrote, was based\non a childhood memory of accompanying her mother to pick up her intoxicated\nfather from a bar and watching from the back seat of the family car as he was\nmaced by a cop in the parking lot. Sparhawk\u2019s parents didn\u2019t drink\u2014they were\npracticing Mormons\u2014but his father was mercurial. \u201cI got some broken ribs from\ntussles with my father,\u201d he told me, though he hastened to add, \u201cI got tons of\nfriends who put up with way more shit than I did.\u201d Sparhawk, who was diagnosed\nwith severe A.D.H.D. and borderline personality disorder in his late thirties,\nnow believes that his father had similar problems.\n\nSome of Alan Sparhawk\u2019s music equipment, in Duluth, Minnesota.\n\nMusic was a way to repair, or at least circumvent, the damage in the father-\nson relationship\u2014a way to express love. Sparhawk would watch his father play\nguitar, and, as he began to learn the instrument himself, they were able to\nplay together. \u201cIt\u2019s a language that\u2019s untainted,\u201d he said. \u201cYou completely\nconnect with this person, and all the other stuff falls away.\u201d In fifth grade,\nParker joined the school band, drawn to drums because banging on stuff was fun\nand she didn\u2019t have to learn to read music. Sparhawk started playing guitar\naround the same age. He couldn\u2019t pinpoint when they started dating, but he\nremembered the first time they played music together. They were fifteen, and\nhe was over at her house one day after school. He started playing Neil Young\u2019s\n\u201cHeart of Gold,\u201d hoping she would join in on the harmony without his having to\nask. She did.\n\nSparhawk spent a year at Brigham Young University before transferring to the\nUniversity of Minnesota Duluth, where Parker was enrolled. They graduated and\nmarried. Duluth had a small but energetic music scene powered by an intensely\ncommunitarian ethos. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of camaraderie,\u201d Sparhawk said. \u201cWe\u2019re\nall trying to get through the winter, and the town is off the beaten path,\nwith an underdog complex, so there\u2019s a certain flavor to your determination.\u201d\nSparhawk and his friend John Nichols were in a rock band called Zen Identity,\nbut they had grown restless. They were thinking about the inverse propositions\nsuggested by loud, fast music. How much could you strip out of a song before\nit stopped being one? How slow\u2014and, crucially, how low\u2014could you play the\nremaining elements while still commanding the attention of a rock crowd?\n\nSparhawk and Nichols, who was on bass, coaxed a reluctant Parker to play\ndrums. She devised a minimalist setup, playing with brushes more often than\nsticks. Sparhawk sang most of the leads, but it quickly became clear that the\nheart of Low\u2019s sound was the harmonies that Parker and Sparhawk could achieve,\nalong with Parker\u2019s spare drumming. Their first album, \u201cI Could Live in Hope,\u201d\nwas released in February of 1994 on Vernon Yard, then an imprint of Virgin\nRecords. The music is hushed, skeletal, haunting. All the songs have one-word\ntitles, and the album closes with a wrenching cover of \u201cYou Are My Sunshine\u201d\n(listed simply as \u201cSunshine\u201d) that is as bereft as a funeral dirge.\n\nBy staying in Duluth rather than defecting to New York or Seattle (or even\nMinneapolis), Parker and Sparhawk were able to keep their overhead low. They\nworked odd jobs when they had to but lived as full-time musicians as much as\nthey could, which meant long stretches on the road to cultivate the following\nthey were gaining in Europe and the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we were married helped,\u201d Sparhawk said. \u201cI think it gave a\ncertain license for creative intimacy and trust, though it also made us each\nother\u2019s harshest critics and harshest editors.\u201d Nobody knew that better than\nZak Sally, who replaced Nichols in 1994 and went on to become Low\u2019s longest-\nserving bassist. \u201cWe hit it very, very, very hard,\u201d Sally said. \u201cThis is a\nband that makes music, this is also a marriage, this is also a matter of\nfaith. This is also family, this is also friends, and it\u2019s also a job, and\nsome of those lines just cross over each other.\u201d\n\nLow released four albums between 1994 and 1999, as well as a dead-earnest\nChristmas EP with a cover of \u201cLittle Drummer Boy\u201d that ended up soundtracking\na Gap commercial the following year. \u201cSlow Down\u201d is a sixty-second spot in\nwhich seven people, bundled up in brightly colored Gap sweaters and scarves,\nhave a fun-filled slow-motion snowball fight in a frosty field while Low\nperforms one of the most moving versions of \u201cLittle Drummer Boy\u201d ever\nrecorded\u2014not least because Sparhawk\u2019s solemn vocals and Parker\u2019s martial\ntiming suggest that this drummer boy is aware his story is unfolding in the\nshadow of Herod\u2019s massacre of the innocents.\n\nThe ad ran in heavy rotation throughout the 2000 holiday season. And it came\nalong at a critical moment: they\u2019d just found out Parker was pregnant with\ntheir first child, Hollis, so they knew they were headed for a long stretch\nwithout any touring income. They used their Gap-sponsored sabbatical to write\nand record \u201cThings We Lost in the Fire,\u201d which closes with what might be the\nsweetest song in the Low catalogue, \u201cIn Metal.\u201d \u201cPartly hate to see you grow /\nAnd just like your baby shoes / Wish I could keep your little body / In\nmetal,\u201d Parker sings to Hollis, whose laughter and babble can be heard\nthroughout the track. It wasn\u2019t dubbed in later; they\u2019d brought her to the\nrecording sessions. The album came out in January, 2001, and the band launched\na tour to support it. Hollis was ten months old, her Pack \u2019n Play stowed in\nthe back of the van amid the instrument cases and sundry gear.\n\nA year later, Low released \u201cTrust,\u201d which found the band oscillating between\nextremes. \u201cCanada\u201d and \u201cLast Snowstorm of the Year\u201d are loud and catchy enough\nfor rock radio, whereas \u201cLittle Argument with Myself\u201d and \u201cPoint of Disgust\u201d\nare among the most gorgeous and anguished faith songs in the band\u2019s catalogue.\nBut it was \u201cThe Great Destroyer,\u201d from 2005\u2014an angry, muscular, moshable\nrecord\u2014that threw down the gauntlet. It was the band\u2019s first record with the\nlabel Sub Pop, and it was recorded the same year that Parker gave birth to\nCyrus. Parker and Sparhawk were well into their thirties, more than a decade\ninto Low, and tired of being the standard-bearers of \u201cslowcore,\u201d a term that\nthey\u2019d been saddled with early on but had never embraced. Beloved now but\ndivisive at the time (Pitchfork used the words \u201ccrass and boorish\u201d and rated\nit a 5.5), \u201cThe Great Destroyer\u201d proved its point\u2014that Low would not be boxed\nin by critics, fans, or its own history\u2014but the album\u2019s tremendous energy can\nfeel compulsive, as if the band is trying to stay two steps ahead of its own\nexhaustion.\n\nThey kept touring. Parker had mounting reservations about bringing both kids\non the road, but the obvious alternatives\u2014leaving them behind for months at a\ntime, or Parker taking leave from the band\u2014both seemed worse. Amid all this,\nSparhawk\u2019s mental health was deteriorating. He was treating his undiagnosed\nconditions with substance abuse, which for a believing Mormon presented a\nspiritual crisis on top of the practical one. In May, 2005, the band cancelled\nits summer tour because Sparhawk was having what he later described as a\nnervous breakdown. He had visions of the apocalypse and came to believe that\nhe was the Antichrist. He spent about a week in a psychiatric hospital. \u201cLong\nenough to get a little bit of antipsychotic medication and realize you are\ndelusional,\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd then you crash really, really, really, really,\nreally hard. Because you realize this spiritual experience that you\u2019ve been\nhaving is a complete joke and a lie.\u201d\n\nSparhawk began to pursue formal treatment, including medication and talk\ntherapy. He hasn\u2019t had another serious episode since. But it was a tumultuous,\nhalting recovery. Sally, the band\u2019s bassist, told me, \u201cThere was a candle\nburning at both ends for many years, and it just stopped burning, and I had to\nleave.\u201d He quit the band in October, 2005. In a message that he later wrote to\nHollis, he told her, \u201cMe and your mom and dad were mad at each other for a\nwhile, but we never did not love each other. Ever.\u201d\n\nSally was replaced by Matt Livingston, who played in Sparhawk\u2019s hard-rock\nsideband, the Retribution Gospel Choir. Low launched back into writing and\nrecording, but now scheduled tours with some deference to the school calendar\nand usually limited itself to a few weeks at a time on the road. A couple\nyears later, Parker and Sparhawk bought their neighbor\u2019s house, in Duluth, and\ncreated a practice space in the light-filled living room next door. There was\nmore space for Sparhawk\u2019s collection of guitars and effects pedals, and they\ncould even record if they wanted to, without having to go anywhere or pay for\nstudio time. Technology had improved enough that weird or extravagant ideas\ncould be attempted with the click of a button.\n\n\u201cAlan, in particular, took what he would otherwise do with a guitar and did it\nwith electronic equipment and editing stuff,\u201d the music writer Bruce Adams\ntold me. (Adams is currently working on an oral history of Low.) \u201cAlso, I\nthink Mim\u2019s influence is in there: \u2018What can we do with the vocals? How can we\nmaintain these threads of melody through all this static?\u2019 \u201d On \u201cDouble\nNegative\u201d (2018), Low threw down another gauntlet. Released the year of the\nband\u2019s twenty-fifth anniversary, the album is jagged and unforgiving\u2014full of\nfeedback, distortion, industrial stutter, and glitched-out chaos. The eleven\nsongs flow into one another, like a long explosion detonating in waves.\nSparhawk told me, \u201cSay I have a song. I know the chords and movement and the\narrangement in and out, but I want to hear it done with sounds I\u2019ve never\nheard before. And I want it to blow my mind. Once you taste that, it\u2019s really,\nreally difficult to go back.\u201d\n\nThe first episode of Low\u2019s streaming series, \u201cIt\u2019s Friday I\u2019m in Low,\u201d was\nbroadcast on YouTube on April 3, 2020, a few weeks after the first COVID-19\nlockdown began in the U.S. We see Parker and Sparhawk, slightly out of focus\non what is clearly a cell-phone camera. She\u2019s haloed by a full head of curly\ndark-brown hair, perched on a radiator behind her trademark minimalist drum\nkit: one cymbal, one floor tom, one snare. He\u2019s sitting on a plain wooden\nchair, steadying his electric guitar on his thigh with one hand and holding a\npint glass full of water in the other. They\u2019re both wearing black button-up\nshirts and black jeans; Sparhawk has begun to let his hair grow out. The first\nthing you hear is Hollis off camera, twenty years old and home from college,\ntelling her parents, \u201cYou\u2019re now live. All right, go.\u201d Sparhawk introduces the\nproject: \u201cThis is for everybody who is out there alone, especially, and people\ngoing through some tough times and some questions and some fears.\u201d Their five-\nsong set included a Hendrix-homage take on \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d and the\nd\u00e9but of an unnamed song that would go on to become \u201cDays Like These.\u201d It\nwasn\u2019t long before Cyrus joined the streaming series to sit in on bass.\n\nLow was putting the finishing touches on \u201cHey What\u201d when Parker\u2019s ovarian\ncancer was detected, near the end of 2020. The diagnosis came late, and the\nprognosis was dire. There were multiple surgeries and heavy chemotherapy. For\na while, she seemed to have beaten long odds. When \u201cHey What\u201d was released in\nSeptember, 2021, she was well enough that the band toured to support it. But\nthe cancer returned in the summer of 2022, and it had spread to her lungs. Low\nplayed its last show on September 4, 2022, in Duluth\u2019s Bayfront Park. It was a\ncold, gray, blustery day, and everyone onstage was wearing winter coats.\nParker\u2019s voice sounded as strong as ever. The next month, she was told that\nshe had a month to live. A week after that, she was gone.\n\nThere was no question of Low continuing without Parker. \u201cMim was the glue,\u201d\nSally told me. \u201cShe had this effortless melodic sense. Me and Alan would be\nbanging our heads against the wall downstairs in the practice room trying to\nget at the core of some song, and she\u2019d just walk in and do something first\ntake\u2014it was intuitive for her.\u201d Some people close to her say she was shy or\nguarded, but onstage that reserve came across as impeccable cool. Lois Maffeo,\nwho records as Lois, and who met Sparhawk and Parker when they started\ntouring, told me, \u201c \u2018Majestic\u2019 is a word that comes to mind for Mim, not in\nthe sense that she held herself in a position of power, but that her essence\nas a person was to be so comfortable with herself.\u201d\n\nAs word spread of Parker\u2019s death, tributes poured in from across the music\nworld. Death Cab for Cutie added a cover of Low\u2019s \u201cThe Plan\u201d to the acoustic\nversion of their album \u201cAsphalt Meadows.\u201d Phoebe Bridgers and Storefront\nChurch covered \u201cWords,\u201d from Low\u2019s first album, which came out the year\nBridgers was born. \u201cI probably took a lot of inspiration from Low, because my\nmusic tends to be pretty slow and drawn out,\u201d Bridgers told me. \u201cThere\u2019s\nsparsity, letting people fill in the gaps, to feel something that isn\u2019t\ndirectly handed to them.\u201d Like many of the women I spoke to about Parker,\nBridgers emphasized that she had been a role model: a female drummer (rare\nenough in rock) who was also co-lead singer and songwriter, and who didn\u2019t try\nto hide the fact that she was a mother. \u201cI have a friend who saw them when\nMimi was, like, very pregnant,\u201d Bridgers told me. \u201cAnd that rocks to me\u2014that\nimage really sticks in my mind.\u201d\n\nLike their parents and grandparents, Cyrus and Hollis have music in their\nblood. They both play multiple instruments and sing. Cyrus had stayed on as\nbass player until the end of the streaming show\u2019s run, and, before long, he\nand his father were jamming and writing songs together. \u201cIt feels right to be\nplaying this music with my son,\u201d Sparhawk told me soon after I met him. We\nwere at the practice space in Duluth, eating a couple of sandwiches at one\ncorner of a large dining table, most of which was given over to a circus-\nthemed jigsaw puzzle that Parker had been working on before she died. He\u2019d\nmade the statement with confidence, but the phrasing had emphasized that the\narrangement might be temporary, or at least conditional. I asked him recently\nwhether he still felt that way. \u201cWell, we\u2019re still playing,\u201d he said. Derecho\nRhythm Section now has ten songs up on Bandcamp, six of which feature Hollis\non backing vocals.\n\nIn late 2023, Sparhawk began to play more often as a solo act: there was a\nshort European tour in November, and this year he\u2019s played shows in New York\nCity, Chicago, and a handful of cities around the South, all of them with\nCyrus playing bass in his backing band. (Hollis sat in on drums at the New\nYork shows.) He\u2019s also been recording again, experimenting with improvising\nguitar and pitch-shifted vocals over a preset synthesizer clocked to a drum\nmachine. \u201cI was messing with this rigid stuff. There were moments where it\nwould quickly become very visceral, very spontaneous,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve\ncreated the structure for it to happen and come through you, but you\u2019re\ntrusting the universe about what is going to come in.\u201d The fruits of this work\nwill be released this fall under his own name, as a record called \u201cWhite\nRoses, My God.\u201d \u2666\n\n## New Yorker Favorites\n\n  * Why facts don\u2019t change our minds.\n\n  * The tricks rich people use to avoid taxes.\n\n  * The man who spent forty-two years at the Beverly Hills Hotel pool.\n\n  * How did polyamory get so popular?\n\n  * The ghostwriter who regrets working for Donald Trump.\n\n  * Snoozers are, in fact, losers.\n\n  * Fiction by Jamaica Kincaid: \u201cGirl\u201d\n\nSign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New\nYorker.\n\nMore:Music, MusiciansIndie Rock\n\n### Goings On\n\nWhat we\u2019re watching, listening to, and doing this week, online, in N.Y.C., and\nbeyond.
