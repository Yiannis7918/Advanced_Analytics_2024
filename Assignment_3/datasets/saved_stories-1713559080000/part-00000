As the country that had sent him into space no longer existed, his\nreturn was delayed and he stayed in space for 311 consecutive days, twice as\nlong as the mission had originally called for.^[2]\n\nHe retired as a cosmonaut in 2007 and was working^[when?] as vice president of\nSpace Corporation Energia. From 2009 to 2014, he headed the Yuri Gagarin\nCosmonaut Training Center.\n\n## Biography[edit]\n\nKrikalev was born in Leningrad in the Soviet Union (now Saint Petersburg,\nRussia). He enjoyed swimming, skiing, cycling, aerobatic flying, and amateur\nradio operations, particularly from space (callsign U5MIR). He graduated from\nhigh school in 1975. In 1981, he received a mechanical engineering degree from\nthe Leningrad Mechanical Institute, now called Baltic State Technical\nUniversity.\n\nAfter graduation in 1981, he joined NPO Energia, the Russian industrial\norganization responsible for crewed space flight activities. He tested space\nflight equipment, developed space operations methods, and participated in\nground control operations. When the Salyut 7 space station failed in 1985, he\nworked on the rescue mission team, developing procedures for docking with the\nuncontrolled station and repairing the station's on-board system.\n\n### Mir[edit]\n\nKrikalev was selected as a cosmonaut in 1985, completed his basic training in\n1986, and, for a time, was assigned to the Buran Shuttle program. In early\n1988, he began training for his first long-duration flight aboard the Mir\nspace station.\n\nThis training included preparations for at least six EVAs (space walks),\ninstallation of a new module, the first test of the new Manned Maneuvering\nUnit (MMU), and the second joint Soviet-French science mission. Soyuz TM-7 was\nlaunched on 26 November 1988, with Krikalev as flight engineer, Commander\nAleksandr Volkov, and French astronaut Jean-Loup Chr\u00e9tien. The previous crew\n(Vladimir Titov, Musa Manarov, and Valeri Polyakov) remained on Mir for\nanother 25 days, marking the longest period a six-person crew had been in\norbit. After the previous crew returned to Earth, Krikalev, Polyakov, and\nVolkov continued to conduct experiments aboard the Mir station. Because the\narrival of the next crew had been delayed, they prepared the Mir for a period\nof uncrewed operations before returning to Earth on 27 April 1989.\n\nIn April 1990, Krikalev began preparing for his second flight as a member of\nthe backup crew for the eighth long-duration Mir mission, which also included\nfive EVAs and a week of Soviet-Japanese operations. In December 1990, Krikalev\nbegan training for the ninth Mir mission which included training for ten EVAs.\nSoyuz TM-12 launched on 19 May 1991, with Krikalev as flight engineer,\nCommander Anatoly Artsebarsky, and British astronaut Helen Sharman. Sharman\nreturned to Earth with the following crew after one week, while Krikalev and\nArtsebarsky remained on Mir. During the summer, they conducted six EVAs to\nperform a variety of experiments and some station maintenance tasks.\n\nIn July 1991, Krikalev agreed to stay on Mir as flight engineer for the next\ncrew, scheduled to arrive in October because the next two planned flights had\nbeen reduced to one. The engineer slot on the Soyuz TM-13 flight on 2 October\n1991, was filled by Toktar Aubakirov, an astronaut from the Kazakh Soviet\nSocialist Republic, who had not been trained for a long-duration mission. Both\nAubakirov and Franz Viehb\u00f6ck, the first Austrian astronaut, returned with\nArtsebarsky on 10 October 1991. Commander Alexander Volkov remained on board\nwith Krikalev. After the crew replacement in October, Volkov and Krikalev\ncontinued Mir experiment operations and conducted another EVA before returning\nto Earth on 25 March 1992.\n\nThroughout his various missions aboard Mir, Krikalev regularly communicated\nwith various amateur radio operators (hams) across the globe. A particularly\nlengthy relationship was formed between Krikalev and amateur radio operator\nMargaret Iaquinto. At one point during one of his stays in space, he contacted\nher once a day for an entire year. Krikalev and Iaquinto successfully\ncommunicated via packet radio for the first time in history between an\norbiting space station and an amateur radio operator. They communicated about\npersonal matters, as well as political ones. Iaquinto set up a makeshift\ndigital bulletin board that the Mir cosmonauts would often use to obtain\nuncensored western news and information regarding the state of the collapsing\nSoviet Union.^[3]\n\nKrikalev was in space when the Soviet Union was dissolved on 26 December 1991.\nWith the Baikonur Cosmodrome and the landing area both being located in the\nnewly independent Kazakhstan, there was a great deal of uncertainty about the\nfate of his mission. He remained in space twice as long as originally planned,\nspending a total of 311 days in space.^[2] Because Krikalev spent so much time\nin space traveling at high velocities, time dilation (or the slowing down of\nclocks) caused him to be 0.02 seconds younger than other people born at the\nsame time as him.^[4]^[5] He returned to Earth on 25 March and is sometimes\nreferred to as the \"last Soviet citizen\".^[2]^[6]^[7]^[8] These events are\ndocumented and contextualized in Romanian filmmaker Andrei Ujic\u0103's 1995\ndocumentary Out of the Present.^[9] Krikalev's story inspired the 2017 film\nSergio & Sergei, directed by Ernesto Daranas.^[10]\n\n### Space Shuttle[edit]\n\nExpedition 11 Commander Sergei Krikalev dons a training space suit.\n\nIn October 1992, NASA announced that an experienced cosmonaut would fly aboard\na future Space Shuttle mission. Krikalev was one of two candidates named by\nthe Russian Space Agency for mission specialist training with the crew of\nSTS-60. In April 1993, he was assigned as prime mission specialist. In\nSeptember 1993, Vladimir Titov was selected to fly on STS-63 with Krikalev\ntraining as his backup.\n\nKrikalev flew on STS-60, the first joint U.S./Russian Space Shuttle Mission.\nLaunched on 3 February 1994, STS-60 was the second flight of the Space\nHabitation Module-2 (Spacehab-2), and the first flight of the Wake Shield\nFacility (WSF-1). During the eight-day flight, the crew of Discovery conducted\na wide variety of materials science experiments, both on the Wake Shield\nFacility and in the Spacehab, Earth observation, and life science experiments.\nKrikalev conducted significant portions of the Remote Manipulator System (RMS)\noperations during the flight. Following 130 orbits of the Earth in 3,439,705\nnautical miles (6,370,334 km), STS-60 landed at Kennedy Space Center, Florida,\non 11 February 1994. With the completion of this flight, Krikalev logged an\nadditional eight days, seven hours, nine minutes in space.\n\nKrikalev returned to duty in Russia following his American experience on\nSTS-60. Periodically he returned to the Johnson Space Center in Houston to\nwork with CAPCOM in Mission Control and ground controllers in Russia\nsupporting joint U.S./Russian Missions STS-63, STS-71, STS-74 and STS-76.\n\nKrikalev and Robert Cabana became the first people to enter the ISS in\nDecember 1998, when they turned on the lights in the US module Unity.\n\nSergei Krikalev with James H. Newman on the left during STS-88\n\nKrikalev flew on STS-88 Endeavour (4\u201315 December 1998), the first\nInternational Space Station assembly mission. During the 12-day mission the\nUnity module was mated with Zarya module. Two crew members performed three\nspace walks to connect umbilicals and attach tools and hardware for use in\nfuture EVAs. The crew also performed IMAX Cargo Bay Camera (ICBC) operations,\nand deployed two satellites, Mighty Sat 1 and SAC-A. The mission was\naccomplished in 185 orbits of the Earth in 283 hours and 18 minutes.\n\n### International Space Station[edit]\n\nKrikalev was a member of the Expedition 1 crew. They launched 31 October 2000,\non a Soyuz rocket from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, successfully docking\nwith the station on 2 November 2000. During their stay on the station, they\nprepared the inside of the orbital outpost for future crews. They also saw the\nstation grow in size with the installation of the U.S. solar array structure\nand the U.S. Destiny Laboratory Module. They left the station with the STS-102\ncrew, undocking from the station on 18 March with landing at the Kennedy Space\nCenter, Florida, on 21 March 2001.\n\nKrikalev was also the commander of Expedition 11. He lived and worked aboard\nthe International Space Station on a six-month tour of duty. This was the\nthird time he had flown to the International Space Station. Expedition 11\nlaunched from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 14 April 2005 aboard a\nSoyuz spacecraft and docked with the ISS on 16 April 2005. Following eight\ndays of joint operations and handover briefings, they replaced the Expedition\n10 crew who returned to earth aboard Soyuz. Expedition 11 plans called for two\nspacewalks, the first in August from the US Quest airlock in US spacesuits,\nand the second, in September, in Russian spacesuits from the Pirs airlock. On\n16 August 2005 at 1:44 a.m. EDT he passed the record of 748 days in space held\nby Sergei Avdeyev.^[1]\n\nExpedition 11 undocked from the ISS on 10 October 2005 at 5:49 p.m. EDT and\nlanded in Kazakhstan on 10 October 2005 at 9:09 p.m. EDT. They were replaced\nby William S. McArthur and Valeri Tokarev, the crew of Expedition 12.^[1]\n\nIn completing his sixth space flight, Krikalev logged 803 days and 9 hours and\n39 minutes in space, including eight EVAs. He is currently fourth to Gennady\nPadalka, Oleg Kononenko and Yuri Malenchenko in the record for the most time\nspent in space.\n\nKrikalev's contributions to the ISS were not limited to his on-orbit time. On\n15 June 2007, Krikalev was brought to the Russian Mission Control center to\ninstruct Expedition 15 Flight Engineer Oleg Kotov on how he and ISS Commander\nFyodor Yurchikhin could jump-start the Russian segment's crippled computer\nsystems.\n\n### Later career[edit]\n\nOn 15 February 2007, Krikalev was appointed Vice President of the S.P. Korolev\nRocket and Space Corporation Energia (Russian: \u0420\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0442\u043d\u043e-\u043a\u043e\u0441\u043c\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f\n\"\u042d\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0438\u044f\" \u0438\u043c. \u0421.\u041f.\u041a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0430) in charge of crewed space flights.^[citation\nneeded] In that office, he was the administrator of the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut\nTraining Center from 2009 to 2014.^[11]\n\n### In popular culture[edit]\n\nA character based on Krikalev features in the 2017 Cuban film drama Sergio and\nSergei, in which a professor and amateur radio enthusiast in Havana contacts a\ncosmonaut named Sergei aboard the Mir space station. The film draws parallels\nbetween economic hardships in Cuba at the time and the fall of the Soviet\nUnion, which occurred as the real-life Krikalev was aboard Mir.^[12]\n\nChilean rock band Fulano composed a song after him, named Krikalev, included\nin their 1997 album \"Trabajos In\u00fatiles\" (Useless works).\n\n## Public activities[edit]\n\nFrom 1999 to 2007, Krikalev was President of the Russian Gliding Federation.\n\nOn 14 February 2012, Krikalev was approved as a member of the Public Chamber\nof the Central Federal District and a confidant of the Prime Minister and\npresidential candidate Vladimir Putin,^[13] and at the first plenary meeting\non 14 September of the same year, he was elected Secretary of the\nChamber.^[14]\n\nOn 12 April 2014, Krikalev was appointed Plenipotentiary Representative of the\nGovernor of Sevastopol in Moscow and St. Petersburg.^[15]^[16]\n\nIn September 2016, Krikalev became a confidant of the United Russia party in\nthe elections to the State Duma of the 7th Convocation.\n\nSince 2017, Krikalev has been the President of the Aircraft Sports Federation\nof Russia. On 16 December 2017, at the Baikonur Cosmodrome, he became the\nAmbassador of the WorldSkills Kazan 2019 Championship.\n\nIn January 2018, Krikalev became a confidant of Vladimir Putin in the upcoming\npresidential elections on 18 March 2018.^[17]\n\nKrikalev is a member of the Expert Council of the National Prize \"Crystal\nCompass\"^[18] and President of the International Environmental Foundation\n\"Clean Seas\" (since 2009).^[19]\n\n## Missions[edit]\n\n  * Soyuz TM-7: Launched 26 November 1988\n  * Soyuz TM-12: Launched 19 May 1991\n  * STS-60 Space Shuttle Discovery: Launched 3 February 1994\n  * STS-88 Space Shuttle Endeavour: Launched 4 December 1998\n  * ISS Expedition 1: Launched 31 October 2000\n  * ISS Expedition 11: Launched 14 April 2005\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\nHe was a member of the Russian and Soviet national aerobatic flying teams, and\nwas Champion of Moscow in 1983, and Champion of the Soviet Union in 1986.\n\nFor his contributions to the Russian space program, he was the very first\nperson awarded with the title of Hero of the Russian Federation.\n\nFor his space flight experience, he was awarded:\n\n  * the title of Hero of the Russian Federation;\n  * the title of Hero of the Soviet Union (USSR);\n  * the title of Pilot-Cosmonaut of the USSR (USSR);\n  * the Order of Lenin (USSR);\n  * Order For Merit to the Fatherland 4th class;\n  * Order of Honour;\n  * Order of Friendship of Peoples (USSR);\n  * Medal \"For Merit in Space Exploration\";\n  * Medal \"In Commemoration of the 300th Anniversary of Saint Petersburg\".\n\nForeign awards:\n\n  * Officer of the Legion of Honour (France);\n  * NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal (USA);\n  * three NASA Space Flight Medals (USA).\n\nHe overtook Sergei Avdeyev's previous record for the career total time spent\nin space (747.59 days) during Expedition 11 to the International Space\nStation.
