Some were\naffiliate marketing sites and some people had their entire livelihoods\ndepended on it.\n\nIts so bad that people have been making posts on /r/SEO about Google killing\nthe SEO industry as many have to go back to finding their jobs after a decade.\n\nGoogle killing the SEO industry\n\n\u275d\n\nThe best time to buy is when there's blood in the streets.\n\n~ Baron Rothschild\n\nSo while most of them are oblivious to the UGC game, some of them are using it\nto their benefit.\n\nSince UGC sites are ranking way up, most are busy gaming sites like Reddit,\nLinkedin Pulse, Medium, and Quora that let you submit your own UGC content\nwithout needing any big publication\u2019s approval.\n\nReddit UGC Traffic Shot Up\n\nLinkedin UGC Traffic Shot Up\n\nMedium UGC Traffic Shot Up\n\nThis algorithm allowed every simple reddit query to rank up.\n\nSince 2020, Tiktokers have been giving tips about appending \"reddit\" to a\nGoogle Search so most people are used to doing that now.\n\nIf you search for \"best vpn\" which is a very high-quality search term, you\nwill see tons of Reddit posts ranking and affiliates making money through it.\n\nThere's 3 ways to do it which is covered super in-depth here:\n\n  1. Hijacking a Top Comment - Just reply to the top comment and later edit it to add your affiliate link\n\n  2. Making your own top comment - Post the comment when the post it is on Rising and then buy upvotes on comments\n\n  3. Creating Your Own Post and Making it Rank - Don't add any links until you get 50+ upvotes and then edit it to add links\n\nRanking on \"best vpn 2024\" is easy on Reddit. Check out this Reddit post.\n\nReddit Rank VPN 2024 - Sneaky first comment\n\nLook at the sneaky first comment here disguising as https://nordvpn.com/free-\ntrial but if you click on it, it actually goes to https://go.nordvpn.net/SH6LI\n\nIts just basic markdown magic on anchor tag.\n\nAlmost all of them are affiliate links if you hover over the links.\n\nIt might be operated by single person or a team of people using 100 different\naccounts.\n\nCreating multiple accounts isn't hard. You only need to verify with Google\n(tons of phone verification services) and need a SIM card (E-SIM works) and\nfinally just sign-up for multiple Reddit accounts since Reddit is anonymous,\nits easy to create multiple accounts.\n\nAll you need are different kinds of proxies with anti-detect browser.\n\nInstead of directly posting affiliate links, one can use a middleman site as\nwell that redirects so you are even more sneaky.\n\nIn any case, this update broke too many people's income and gave too many\npeople a way to get rich.\n\nWhen people make tons of money, they are usually quiet.\n\nThis golden goose might still be quite effective as Google is finding it hard\nto crack down on AI sites.\n\nA well-written AI site is indistinguishable from a well-written human site.\n\nIf you want to rank a product or your site right now, try all the UGC\nplatforms, Reddit being the #1 as you only have to get past the moderators.\n\nI got viral on Reddit with 300k views with a decent strategy.\n\nTwitter is getting into long-form now so it might be the next site to game.\n\nThis is one reason to be on social media because Google prioritizes stuff\nbased on it.\n\nYou can't expect people to find you if you live in the mountains. Don't expect\nGoogle to find you if you have no social presence.\n\nYears ago, I saw a post from a person who stopped posting about their agency\non Social Media. In a matter of months, they saw a dip in clients.\n\nThey did so because they thought social wasn't working with no likes and all\nbut this is one of the under-talked benefits of being on socials.\n\nThe entire web is a chain of interconnected links. If you want to be seen,\nconnect your stuff to more links.\n\n### A tool to do reverse phone lookup so you can find the owner behind the\nphone call\n\nIf you want to know who is calling you from a US phone number, you can look it\nup through This Number. It helps find unknown phone numbers.\n\nYou can also use it to contact local businesses, government organizations, or\nan old friend by state.\n\nCold email is good. Cold call is even better.\n\nIf you have a target audience that fits this demographic, you can just start\ndialing.\n\n### One recommended video on how to get 10,000 people to promote your stuff\nfor free\n\nThe best kind of marketing is word-of-mouth.\n\nBecause even if you are dead, your book will still sell through word-of-mouth.\n\nMarcus Aurelius died centuries ago yet Meditations still sells purely through\nword-of-mouth.\n\nImagine if your best friend told you to try a product that would help you, you\nwould do it without hesitation.\n\nCaveat: The product must be good or else you will have less goodwill with your\nfriend.\n\nThis video dives deep into how to get thousands of affiliates to promote your\nproduct for free.\n\nGive your affiliates good incentives and they will promote your product like\ncrazy.\n\nLike how Copy AI gave 45% in referral incentives.\n\nYou can copy the affiliate strategies of the VPNs linked above in Reddit\nposts.\n\n### Rabbit Hole Reads\n\n  1.
