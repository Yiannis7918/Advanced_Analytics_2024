They have the giant-defeating potential that David did.\n\nWhat\u2019s \u201ccounter-positioned pricing?\u201d It\u2019s a pricing model that incumbents\ncan\u2019t copy without losing money.\n\nThe classic example1 of counter-positioning is Vanguard index funds. Fund\nmanagers could not offer passively managed funds without cannibalizing high-\nmargin revenue from their managed funds. Even worse: offering unmanaged funds\nwas tantamount to admitting that their core value proposition was bogus, that\nfund managers couldn\u2019t really beat the market.\n\nLLMs open up new counter-positioned pricing models for software.\n\nFor example, lots of marketing software for SaaS companies charge based on\nnumber of users or number of emails sent, but the customer doesn\u2019t get any\nadditional value when an email is sent or a new contact is added. The customer\nonly cares when those marketing efforts convert a free user to a paying\ncustomer.\n\nIf you feed an LLM data about how a user is using a piece of software, the LLM\ncan tell you when the user converts, which means customers can pay for\nconverted users \u2014 the thing they actually care about \u2014 instead of emails sent.\nThis is literally what we\u2019re building.\n\nIncumbents can build LLMs that understand what users do in an app, but they\ncan\u2019t copy the startup\u2019s pricing without losing money. An incumbent that\nprices on emails sent will inevitably build a product that doesn\u2019t optimize a\ncustomer\u2019s ability to convert their users because they get paid regardless.\nSwitching pricing models forces them into a dilemma: lose revenue from\ncustomers who aren\u2019t converting their users or price higher than the startup.\n\nThere are very likely other cases where LLMs open up counter-positioned\npricing models that startups can exploit. I don\u2019t know any others offhand,\nwhich shouldn\u2019t be surprising. Startups exploit billion dollar mistakes, and\ngiven that people are strongly incentivized to avoid making billion dollar\nmistakes, it\u2019s hard for anyone to find a single mistake, much less two.\n\n1\n\nThe idea of \u201cCounter-positioning\u201d and this example comes from 7 Powers, a book\non business strategy by a Stanford economist turned VC.\n\n### Subscribe to Philosophical Hacker\n\nBy Matt Dupree \u00b7 Launched 2 months ago\n\nThoughts on building startups from a wannabe philosophy professor turned\nprogrammer turned founder\n\nShare this post\n\n#### How AI startups can beat incumbents\n\nphilosophicalhacker.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nInternal tools often make bad startup ideas\n\nUsefulness as an internal tool is an overrated signal\n\nFeb 14 \u2022\n\nMatt Dupree\n\n1\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Internal tools often make bad startup ideas\n\nphilosophicalhacker.substack.com\n\n1\n\nWhat your MVP says about your market\n\nThe longer it takes to build an MVP, the less reason you have to build it.\n\nMar 12 \u2022\n\nMatt Dupree\n\n4\n\nShare this post\n\n#### What your MVP says about your market\n\nphilosophicalhacker.substack.com\n\nConflicting employee vs. business incentives slow B2B SaaS growth rates\n\nAn observation from a B2B founder in the trenches\n\nFeb 9 \u2022\n\nMatt Dupree\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Conflicting employee vs. business incentives slow B2B SaaS growth rates\n\nphilosophicalhacker.substack.com\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Matt Dupree\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
