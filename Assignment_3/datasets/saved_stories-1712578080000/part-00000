Sentiment analysis can be a powerful\ntool. This article dives into what it is, how it works, and how to use\navailable APIs to enhance user experience.\n\n## What is Sentiment Analysis?\n\nSentiment analysis isn't anything new and hasn't come about as a result of the\nlatest developments in Large Language Models (LLMs), however, the heightened\ninterest in anything that can be remotely labeled as \"AI\" has made\ncapabilities like sentiment analysis more accessible than ever.\n\nBefore I show you how to implement sentiment analysis, it makes sense first to\nunderstand what it is. Sentiment analysis is a field within natural language\nprocessing (NLP) that focuses on identifying and understanding the underlying\nemotions expressed within text. It goes beyond simple word recognition to\ndecipher the tone and intent behind the words, providing valuable insights\ninto attitudes and opinions expressed within the text. Put simply it tries to\nlabel a piece of text as either positive, negative, or neutral.\n\n## How does Sentiment Analysis work?\n\nSentiment analysis leverages a combination of techniques to take the textual\ninput and return the sentiment and associated metadata. These techniques\ninclude:\n\n  * Natural Language Processing (NLP): This involves breaking down sentences into individual words and phrases, understanding their meaning, grammatical structure, and how they relate to each other.\n  * Machine Learning: Many sentiment analysis tools use machine learning algorithms trained on large datasets of labeled text data. These algorithms learn to associate specific words and phrases with positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.\n  * Lexicon-based Approaches: These utilize pre-built dictionaries of words and phrases associated with particular emotions. These dictionaries may be general or tailored to specific domains or industries.\n\nSentiment analysis can also be performed at different levels of granularity:\n\n  * Document-level: Classifies the overall sentiment of a complete piece of text, such as a product review or a social media post.\n  * Sentence-level: Identifies the sentiment expressed in individual sentences within a document.\n  * Aspect-level: Goes even deeper, pinpointing the sentiment towards specific aspects or features mentioned in the text (e.g., \"The camera is great, but the battery life is terrible.\")\n\nThe good news for software engineers is that powerful third-party services\nsimplify the process, eliminating the need for a deep, low-level understanding\nof these complex concepts. This lets you focus on results.\n\n## How can Sentiment Analysis be used to improve user experience?\n\nOne final thing before we move on to a demonstration. Why would you even want\nto use sentiment analysis? There are probably quite a few more use cases for\nsentiment analysis than you might have considered.\n\n### Direct benefit to users\n\nI believe sentiment analysis can benefit your users' experience in two key\nways: direct and indirect.\n\nEnhance existing software capabilities with sentiment analysis to give more\npower to your users.\n\nDirect is where sentiment analysis is implemented as a feature in your\nsoftware so users can use this additional data to their advantage. A great\nexample of this would be in a news app, where users are able to filter results\nbased on sentiment. This would empower users to customise their news feeds\nduring those days when they need a break from the negativity that can dominate\nnews content. This concept easily extends to other types of data feeds, social\nmedia, product reviews, forums, and more.\n\nYou could also surface the overall sentiment of other types of content to help\nprioritisation of tasks, for example, if you're building a ticket\nmanagement/support solution, allowing teams to identify negative or positive\nrequests might provide some efficiency gains.\n\nThe general concept is to surface sentiment data within your product directly\nto users to enhance their understanding and interaction with your content.\n\nIf you've used sentiment analysis in a software product in the past, please\nshare in the comments for the benefit of all.\n\n### Indirect benefit to users\n\nIndirect, no less beneficial to end-users, is how you, as a business or\nproduct owner can use sentiment analysis outside of your products to learn how\nto improve your products or business.\n\nThere are many ways sentiment analysis can indirectly improve user experience:\n\nPinpointing Problem Areas\n\nUsing aspect-level sentiment analysis you could analyse app store reviews and\nin-app feedback to identify areas that are consistently producing negative\nreactions (frustration with bugs, confusion in the UI, etc.). This allows you\nto focus on fixes where they'll have the most impact on user satisfaction.\n\nSocial Media Monitoring\n\nTrack sentiment around your brand, products, or campaigns across social\nplatforms. Respond quickly to negative comments and nurture positive\nengagement.\n\nRival Products\n\nAnalyse customer sentiment about your competitors' offerings. Spot their\nweaknesses and identify areas where your solution can excel.\n\nMarket Trends\n\nTrack overall sentiment in your industry. Notice shifts in customer needs or\nproblems to inform your product roadmap.\n\n## How can I Implement Sentiment Analysis?\n\nHopefully, you can now see the advantage sentiment analysis could have on your\nproduct's user experience. So how do you go about implementing this as a\nsolution?\n\n### Choose a service to integrate with\n\nAs mentioned early on, we can utilise third-party solutions to do the heavy\nlifting, so step 1 is to choose which service to use. Here are some of the\nbest available today:\n\nMajor Cloud Providers\n\nThese are often a go-to choice due to their scalability and ease of\nintegration if you're already using their platforms.\n\n  * Google Cloud Natural Language API: Well-rounded with good accuracy and detailed sentiment scores. Supports multiple languages.\n  * Amazon Comprehend: Part of Amazon's AI suite. Offers targeted sentiment analysis towards specific entities, helpful for product feedback.\n  * Microsoft Azure Text Analytics: Solid general-purpose option. Its strength lies in seamless integration with other Azure services.\n\nSpecialized Sentiment Analysis Providers\n\nThese often boast refined models for sentiment with a focus on usability:\n\n  * MeaningCloud: Offers features like aspect-based sentiment, useful for analysing opinions on specific product features.\n  * IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding: The natural language AI service for advanced text analytics. Does a lot more than sentiment analysis!\n\nOpen-source\n\nIf you're interested in added flexibility then there are some open-source\noptions available too that you can use to build your own system:\n\n  * NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): A classic Python library. Provides tools for sentiment analysis but requires more coding than pre-built APIs.\n  * VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner): (\ud83d\udcac What a cool name!) Rule-based tool, good for handling social media language and slang.\n\nFactors in Choosing\n\nWhen it comes to deciding which solution to use there are several key factors\nto consider:\n\n  * Accuracy: Do you need the absolute best sentiment analysis for critical tasks, or is general trend analysis sufficient?\n  * Cost: Cloud providers often have flexible pricing, while some specialized APIs may have a per-request cost model.\n  * Language Support: Ensure your chosen API supports the languages relevant to your text data.\n  * Customization: Do you need to fine-tune the sentiment model for your specific industry jargon? Some APIs offer more customization than others.\n\nIf you're already using one of the above-mentioned cloud providers, I'd\nrecommend sticking within your chosen ecosystem as it'll be much easier to\nintegrate into your existing stack.\n\n### A deeper look using Google Cloud Natural Language API\n\nNow we'll take a closer look via an implementation example of how to interface\nwith one of these third parties and perform sentiment analysis. In this\nexample, we'll be using the Google Cloud Natural Language API, for no reason\nother than I'm already familiar with Amazon Comprehend and want to use this as\nan opportunity to explore alternatives! I'll be using Python as the\nprogramming language to demonstrate this.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nBefore we can get started we need to install and set-up a few prerequisites.\n\n  1. Install the gcloud CLI so we can authenticate with the API: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install\n  2. Initialise and log in to gcloud : ./google-cloud-sdk/bin/gcloud init\n  3. Create your credentials file: gcloud auth application-default login\n  4. Ensure the project you are using is set as a quota project: gcloud auth application-default set-quota-project [PROJECT ID]\n  5. Enable the Natural Langage API on your project and configure billing if you've not done so already: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/language.googleapis.com?project=[PROJECT ID]\n  6. Install the google-cloud-language client library: https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/reference/libraries (pip install --upgrade google-cloud-language)\n\nUsing Python and the Google Cloud Natural Language API to analyse sentiment\n\nA simple Python application to get a deeper understanding of how these\nservices work.\n\nNow everything is set we can write a simple Python application to take an\ninput string, send it to the Google Cloud Natural Language API, and return the\nsentiment information.\n\n  1. Create a new directory called sentiment-analysis and cd into it\n\n    \n    \n    $ mkdir sentiment-analysis && cd $_\n\n  2. Create a new file called analyse-sentiment.py in the root of this directory\n\n    \n    \n    $ touch analyse-sentiment.py\n\n  3. Add the following code to the newly created Python file:\n\n    \n    \n    # Imports the Google Cloud client library from google.cloud import language_v1 # Import library so we can accept CLI arguments import argparse # Create the parser and add an argument for the text input parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() parser.add_argument('--text', required=True, help='The text to analyse') args = parser.parse_args() # Instantiate a client for the Natural Language API client = language_v1.LanguageServiceClient() # Create a document with the embedded text input text = args.text document = language_v1.types.Document( content=text, type_=language_v1.types.Document.Type.PLAIN_TEXT ) # Make a request to the API to analyse the sentiment of the text sentiment = client.analyze_sentiment( request={\"document\": document} ) # Print the results of the sentiment analysis print(\"\\n=== SENTIMENT ANALYSIS: =========\") print(\"Input: '{}'\".format(text)) print(\"--- RESULTS: --------------------\") # Display the score and magnitude of the sentiment print(\"Score: {}\".format(sentiment.document_sentiment.score)) print(\"Magnitude: {}\".format(sentiment.document_sentiment.magnitude)) print(\"=================================\")\n\nWith that saved we have a simple application we can run from a terminal to\ndemonstrate how interfacing with the Google Cloud Natural Language API is\ndone.\n\nWithin the root of the sentiment-analysis directory you can issue the\nfollowing command to see the output of the API result:\n\n    \n    \n    $ python analyse-sentiment.py --text \"This meal is delicious.\" === SENTIMENT ANALYSIS: ========= Input: 'This meal is delicious.' --- RESULTS: -------------------- Score: 0.8999999761581421 Magnitude: 0.8999999761581421 =================================\n\nThe API returns score and magnitude values for the document we submitted.\n\n  * score signifies the sentiment of the entire document and ranges from -1.0 which is considered strongly negative and 1.0 which is strongly positive.\n  * magnitude signifies the overall strength of emotion within the document, both positive and negative. The more emotion you have within a document the higher the magnitude.\n\ni\ufe0f\n\nThe API also returns data for each sentence within the input text. For\nsimplicity, we'll only focus on the sentiment of the entire document.\n\nIf we use our simple application we can get a better understanding of how\nscore and magnitude work.\n\nInput Text| Results| Explanation  \n---|---|---  \nI had a great meal last night.| Score: 0.80 Magnitude: 0.80| A positive\nsentiment but not much emotion just the single use of \"great\".  \nI had an amazing meal last night. Honestly, the main was fabulous! The service\nwasn't great though.| Score: 0.40 Magnitude: 2.59| A less positive sentiment\nbecause the bad service partly cancels out the quality of the meal, but this\nincludes more emotion, therefore the magnitude is much higher.  \nThe meal I had last night was awful. The main was cold and the service was\nslow. The worst part was how noisy the place was.| Score: -0.80 Magnitude:\n2.50| A negative sentiment with lots of emotion.  \nThe meeting is at 1 pm.| Score: 0.0 Magnitude: 0.0| A neutral statement with\nno emotion.  \n  \nHopefully, this makes it clearer as to how score and magnitude are affected\nbased on the input. A useful quote from the official API documentation says:\n\n\ud83d\udcac\n\nA document with a neutral score (around 0.0) may indicate a low-emotion\ndocument, or may indicate mixed emotions, with both high positive and negative\nvalues which cancel each out. Generally, you can use magnitude values to\ndisambiguate these cases, as truly neutral documents will have a low magnitude\nvalue, while mixed documents will have higher magnitude values.\n\nIt is important to ensure you fine-tune how you interpret the returned values\nto best suit your use case. For example, if you consider a score of anything\ngreater than 0.0 as positive then you'd need to be happy that the input \"This\nmeal is satisfactory.\", is a positive statement (As its score is 0.30), which\nto me, is at best neutral.\n\nHopefully, this simple example has given you a better understanding of how you\nwould go about implementing a solution using these APIs and it's also given\nyou a deeper understanding of how they work. If you'd like me to follow this\nwith greater detail, perhaps going into how to implement aspect/entity-based\nsentiment analysis please let me know in the comments.\n\nClone the code from GitHub: https://github.com/RevillWeb/sentiment-analysis-\nexample/tree/main\n\nImplementation Considerations\n\nWhen integrating sentiment analysis, carefully consider when to analyse your\ncontent. Cost is a significant factor, as these APIs can become expensive with\nlarge volumes of text. Analyse content once upon creation and only re-analyse\nif it's modified. For example, in a news app, you'd determine and store the\nsentiment of a new article when it's added to your platform. Re-analysing\nevery time a user searches or filters would be inefficient and costly.\n\n### Limitations of Sentiment Analysis\n\nSentiment analysis, while incredibly powerful, has its limitations. Human\nlanguage is remarkably nuanced, filled with subjectivity, sarcasm, and irony.\nThese elements prove challenging for machines to fully understand, often\nleading to misinterpretations. Additionally, words can hold multiple meanings\nand negations can reverse sentiment \u2013 complexities that sentiment analysis\nmodels need to learn to navigate.\n\nFurthermore, sentiment analysis tools can be domain-specific. A model that\nexcels at analyzing movie reviews might struggle with social media posts due\nto differences in language patterns and slang. It's also important to remember\nthat these systems are trained on data, and any inherent biases in that data\ncan lead to skewed results.\n\nWhile sentiment analysis continues to improve, it's important to remain aware\nof these limitations. By using more comprehensive datasets, combining analysis\ntechniques, and aiming for context awareness in models, we can make\nsignificant progress. In critical applications, a human touch to verify the\nresults may still be necessary.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy using third-party services like the Google Cloud Natural Language API we\ncan easily detect sentiment in user-generated text and unlock deeper insights\ninto our users' perception of our products and business. We can also directly\nimpact user experience by surfacing sentiment data within our app to empower\nusers to use our features in new ways.\n\nIf you found this article useful, please share it for the benefit of others\nand subscribe and follow to ensure you don't miss the next one.
