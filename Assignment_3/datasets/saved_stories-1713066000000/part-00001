Given approximately a\n4:1 glide ratio, that means a minimum descent rate of between 25 and 35 mph (=\n~2200 to over 3000 ft/min).\n\nEven neglecting forward speed, impact with a solid surface at that speed will\nbe above 90% fatal; either chest trauma or head trauma can do the job.\n\nA good flare can reduce this descent rate by more than half, perhaps even to\nnear zero if excess forward speed is carried, but then the \"landing\" becomes a\nslide at speeds normally only seen when a motorcyle road racer comes off his\nbike. Those racers often survive with only minor injuries, however; I'd have\ndo say, on that basis, that it's probably possible for an experienced wingsuit\nflier to land, if not safely, at least survivably on smooth asphalt or\nconcrete (water is less desirable as this would then be equivalent to a speed\nwater skier falling at above 100 mph).\n\nThe big issue here is that it's impossible to practice this kind of maneuver\n-- your first landing is the first time you'd try to land, and unlike when\nlearning to fly an aircraft (or even a glider) you don't have an instructor\naboard to coach you and take the controls if necessary, nor the ability to \"go\naround\" if the landing doesn't look right. By the time you're close enough to\ntell if it's good or not, you're fully committed.\n\nIt's worth adding here that wearing a full face helmet and hard body armor on\nchest, abdomen, groin, thighs, knees and shins, plus reinforced boots with\nsteel/composite safety toes and ankle support would greatly reduce the\npossibility of broken bones and life-threatening levels of abrasion and\nlaceration from high speed ground contact. This would be effectively the front\nhalf of what a motorcycle road racer wears (if you do this right, your back\nwon't ever touch the ground).\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\nImprove this answer\n\nFollow this answer to receive notifications\n\nedited Oct 17, 2023 at 17:01\n\nanswered Oct 17, 2023 at 13:34\n\nZeiss IkonZeiss Ikon\n\n17.1k22 gold badges4848 silver badges6565 bronze badges\n\n8\n\n  * 1\n\ndang it zeiss, you beat me to this...\n\n\u2013 Jpe61\n\nOct 17, 2023 at 14:13\n\n  * all of those reinforced armors also do increase form drag and wing loading\n\n\u2013 user21228\n\nOct 17, 2023 at 17:25\n\n  * 1\n\nWing loading, for certain, @jkztd; form drag depends on how the armor is\nshaped and applied.\n\n\u2013 Zeiss Ikon\n\nOct 17, 2023 at 17:55\n\n  * 2\n\nOne possible thought I could have here would be to equip a wing suit flyer\nwith a Landing gear \u2013 I\u2019m thinking something like a pair of skids, similar to\na child\u2019s, snow sled - which would be fitted to the front of the wing suit\nrider\u2019s body.

Wingsuits\naren't especially a \"precision instrument\" to begin with when it comes to\nmaneuvering .\n\nQuestion specifies \"Specific body techniques on impact like rolling\": the\nchances of survival would be highest if the \"pilot\" manages a controlled flat\ntouchdown at reasonable vertical speed.\n\nAs for the conditions, the ground should be extremely flat, a little soft and\npreferably slippery to avoid tumbling which would certainly if not instantly\nkill, then seriously injure the daredevil. My preferred choice of terrain\nwould be a flat wet grass field. A steady headwind might at first sound like a\ngood condition, but when we take into account the fact that wind speed\ndiminishes quickly at low altitudes as the ground approaches, I think headwind\nwould actually make landing harder, as the airspeed would quickly bleed out\nbefore touchdown.\n\nAs an example, motorcycle racers try to avoid rolling if they are thrown off\nthe bike, and instead glide on the ground to bleed off speed. You should note\nthat mc racing gear is like a full body armour, which would of course protect\nthe wingsuit lander, but then again the mc racing gear is very stiff, and\nwould make already hard steering of the wingsuit even more difficult.\n\nI thinks it's safe to assume landing on water would be lethal, as touchdown\nwould most likely lead to a sudden dive/stop. The body form of a skydiver is\nnot able to support aquaplaning , and even if it was, dropping out of planing\nwould lead to a sudden stop and most likely a loss of consciousness.\n\nAs a side note, it is possible to survive a non-parachute landing in a\nwingsuit as demonstrated by Gary Connery, but you need a lot of cardboard\nboxes for it:\n\nHis technique was to bleed off airspeed as much as possible and then slam into\nthe \"cardboard runway\" in a more or less controlled manner.\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\nImprove this answer\n\nFollow this answer to receive notifications\n\nanswered Oct 17, 2023 at 14:11\n\nJpe61Jpe61\n\n28.7k22 gold badges7575 silver badges123123 bronze badges\n\n7\n\n  * 3\n\nGreat video!

One has to distinguish between gaining altitude with room to spare and flaring to land. Very, very different. When you pull up in flight, you think in tens of feet. When flaring to land in a wingsuit you think in inches \ud83d\ude03\n\n\u2013 Jpe61\n\nOct 17, 2023 at 21:06\n\n  * Gary connery's landing could best be described by the aviation term \"positive landing\".

And it would be at\nleast as feasible to attempt as the cardboard box landing seen in the other\nanswer.\n\nAs seen in this video, (thanks @jkztd) the wingsuit flyer levels off\napproximately 10-20 feet above the water, then climbs enough to crest a dam at\nthe end.\n\nWith this kind of precision and control a skilled flyer could fly low enough\nand almost parallel to the surface to begin dragging their toes, eventually\nsettling and slowing enough to arch their back and skim the water on their\nbelly. Effectively they could \"body surf\" at high speed until the drag slowed\nthem enough to settle fully into the water.\n\nFor comparison, consider that even if you fall hard towards the water from\nstanding level on a water ski at 25-30mph it will result in skipping and\nsliding for some distance before settling down.\n\nThere's no reason why you couldn't do the same thing on the vast expanse of a\nfrozen lake either.\n\nHowever, I don't agree it would be possible to survive without significant\ninjury on solid ground, (grass, dry lake bed, etc.) since the increased\nfriction could result in violent tumbling. (although I have seen videos of\nrather violent tumbling and sliding at high speeds by motorcycle racers and\nthey have walked away...)\n\nI'm not saying that it would be easy, or that I would try, but it seems quite\nfeasible to attempt...\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\nImprove this answer\n\nFollow this answer to receive notifications\n\nedited Oct 19, 2023 at 19:50\n\nanswered Oct 19, 2023 at 19:44\n\nMichael HallMichael Hall\n\n26k22 gold badges6262 silver badges9999 bronze badges\n\n2\n\n  * For the very reason of tumbling avoidance, I suggested the \"best case scenario\" of wet grass. You have made a good point about water skiers skipping on water after falling though. My concern is that the speed of the wingsuit wacko would be twice that of the water skier. Certainly that might make for more spectacular skipping, but also for more violent tumbling. +1 anyway.\n\n\u2013 Jpe61\n\nOct 20, 2023 at 11:57\n\n  * 1\n\n@Jpe61, the risk of tumbling on water could be mitigated by incorporating some\nlongitudinal striations or shallow fins in the bottom of the wingsuit for\ndirectional stability upon touchdown.\n\n\u2013 Michael Hall\n\nOct 20, 2023 at 19:33\n\nAdd a comment |\n\nThis answer is useful\n\n2\n\nSave this answer.\n\nShow activity on this post.\n\nEven if the wingsuiter can indeed flare to reach zero vertical velocity very\nclose to the ground, or water, contact point will still be feet and knees\nfirst, pivoting around that point to slam the wingsuiter's head against the\nsurface.\n\nHaving some landing gear, monowheel or nautical ski might help\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\nImprove this answer\n\nFollow this answer to receive notifications\n\nedited Oct 20, 2023 at 12:25\n\nanswered Oct 17, 2023 at 18:01\n\nuser21228user21228\n\n10\n\n  * Nifty video!
