A nothing message sent by Ray Tomlinson in 1971\nto test the system. But email has stayed, and has largely stayed\ndecentralized, and from that \u2014 its ubiquity and lack of central authority \u2014\nemail has become one of the most boringly powerful publishing platforms\naround.\n\nI fear we\u2019re entering an era of newsletter fatigue, but a month ago I started\na new one. It\u2019s called Ridgeline, it\u2019s about walking \u2014 the perambulatory,\nwandery version \u2014 through the mountains and old paths of Japan.\n\nThe newsletter is weekly, composed of a single photograph, and (usually,\nhopefully) no more than 500 words.^1 It\u2019s meant to be low-stress high-reward.\nAn email you knock down in about a minute, scan quickly, mark as done. But\nI\u2019ve written several of them so far, and I am incapable of abiding by these\nrules.\n\nAs to the primary topic: Japan has been my home base for the better part of my\nlife, and I\u2019ve compulsively walked bits and pieces of the country these past\nsix years. I\u2019m interested in the connection between this impulse and the\nboundless connectivity we\u2019re all presently awash in.\n\nBut more broadly, launching it has given me reason to consider the state of\nnewsletters and email, in 2019: Things are unexpectedly amazing.\n\nNewsletters and newsletter startups these days are like mushrooms in an open\nfield after a good spring rain. I don\u2019t know a single writer who isn\u2019t\nnewslettering or newsletter-curious, and for many, the newsletter is where\nthey\u2019re doing their finest public work.\n\nAs for the present landscape of NAASes (Newsletter As A Services):\n\n  * Substack is the current NAAS darling, built from the ground up for charging subscribers a monthly or yearly fee.^2\n  * Buttondown is a (somewhat) recently launched NAAS built by a very engaged developer, beautifully designed, that looks like it might be the new TinyLetter. Subscription integrations forthcoming (eating into Substack territory?). This is probably where I\u2019d start if I were starting a public newsletter today.\n  * TinyLetter, founded in 2010, was the old darling that rekindled a general interest in the newsletter genre. It was quickly gobbled up by MailChimp in 2011, though, and has a somewhat uncertain future, so it\u2019s tricky to recommend starting your newsletter on it today.\n  * Memberful is a generalized subscription service, but it integrates with most major NAASes, thereby allowing one to roll their own paid newsletter with a bit more flexibility, as Ben Thompson has done to much success with Stratechery. My own SPECIAL PROJECTS membership program and its attendant Inside SP private newsletter is powered by Memberful as well.\n\nAs to why the landscape now burgeons, I address that in part in a recent Wired\nessay:\n\n> One way to understand this [newsletter] boom is that as social media has\n> siloed off chunks of the open-web, sucking up attention, the energy that was\n> once put into blogging has now shifted to email. Robin Sloan [(Year of the\n> Meteor newsletter)] in a recent \u2014 of course \u2014 email newsletter, lays it out\n> thusly:\n\n> > In addition to sending several email newsletters, I subscribe to many, and\n> I talk about them a lot; you might have heard me say this at some point (or\n> seen me type it) but I think any artist or scholar or person-in-the-world\n> today, if they don\u2019t have one already, needs to start an email list\n> immediately.\n\n> > Why? Because we simply cannot trust the social networks, or any\n> centralized commercial platform, with these cliques and crews most vital to\n> our lives, these bands of fellow-travelers who are \u2013 who must be \u2013 the first\n> to hear about all good things. Email is definitely not ideal, but it is:\n> decentralized, reliable, and not going anywhere \u2013 and more and more, those\n> feel like quasi-magical properties.\n\nOwnership is the critical point here. Ownership in email in the same way we\nown a paperback: We recognize that we (largely) control the email subscriber\nlists, they are portable, they are not governed by unknowable algorithmic\ntimelines.^3 And this isn\u2019t ownership yoked to a company or piece of software\noperating on quarterly horizon, or even multi-year horizon, but rather to a\nhalf-century horizon. Email is a (the only?) networked publishing technology\nwith both widespread, near universal adoption,^4 and history. It is, as they\nsay, proven.\n\n#### #Minimize Instagram\n\nThat ownership of platform, putting edges around digital things \u2014 creating a\nwell-defined unit, a package, something to be delivered \u2014 and of course the\ndesire to share my walking-in-Japan experiences led me to launch Ridgeline as\na newsletter. But I also felt impelled to minimize reliance on Instagram.^5\n\nFacebook has collapsed as a viable marketing / distribution platform for me.\nTwitter is fine, but the audience trends heavily to certain demographics. And\nas lovely as Instagram has been,^6 with the loss of its cofounders in 2018, I\nfeel like we are entering the Death By Monetization/OptimizationTM spiral that\nFacebook is so very good at.\n\nPart of what made Facebook a breath of fresh air ten years ago was its\nrelative minimalism compared to MySpace, etc. Now it\u2019s a full-blown space\nshuttle interface.\n\nRepeat for Messenger.\n\nAnd, now, repeat once again for Instagram.\n\nInstagram will only get more complex, less knowable, more algorithmic, more\nengagement-hungry in 2019.^7\n\n#### #Weary bones\n\nI\u2019ve found this cycle has fomented another emotion beyond distrust, one I\u2019ve\nfelt most acutely in 2018: Disdain? (Feels too loaded.) Disappointment? (Too\nmoralistic.) Wariness? (Yes!) Yes \u2014 wariness over the way social networks and\nthe publishing platforms they provide shift and shimmy beneath our feet, how\nthe algorithms now show posts of X quality first, or then Y quality first, or\nhow, for example, Instagram seems to randomly show you the first image of a\nmulti-image sequence or, no wait, the second.^8\n\nI try to be deliberate, and social networks seem more and more to say: You\ndon\u2019t know what you want, but we do. Which, to someone who, you know, gives a\nshit, is pretty dang insulting.\n\nWariness is insidious because it breeds weariness. A person can get tired just\nopening an app these days. Unpredictable is the last thing a publishing\nplatform should be but is exactly what these social networks become. Which can\nmake them great marketing tools, but perhaps less-than-ideal for publishing.\n\nThe desire is simply to publish photos on my own terms. And to minimize the\nchemical rewards for being anodyne, which is what these general algorithms\nseem to optimize for: things that are easily digestible, firmly on the scale\nof \u201cfine, just fine.\u201d It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, as the more\nboring stuff we shove into our eyeballs, the more boring our taste becomes.\n\nAnd so here we are: leaning on an open, beautifully staid, inert protocol.\nSMTP as our savior.\n\n#### #Silence\n\nHere\u2019s another, more subtle, point about the grace of email and newsletters:\nCreation and consumption don\u2019t happen in the same space. When I go to send a\nmissive in Campaign Monitor the world of my laptop screen is as silent as a\nmidnight Tokyo suburb.^9 I think we\u2019ve inured ourselves to the (false) truth\nthat in order to post something, in order to contribute something to the\nstream, we must look at the stream itself, \u201cBird Box\u201d-esque, and woe be the\nperson in a productive creative jag, wanting to publish, who can resist those\nhot political tweets.\n\n#### #Good peoples\n\nIf I\u2019m writing about newsletters, let me point at some that excite and\ndelight:\n\n  * Joanne McNeil\u2019s All My Stars \u2014 a catalyst that has led me to pick up a number of books that have enchanted to the moon.\n  * VQR\u2019s Allison Wright\u2019s I Don\u2019t Hate It for similar reasons and fine writing.\n  * Warren Ellis\u2019 Orbital Operations for making me feel like I am never working hard enough. It has also become an archetype of the rhythm of work work working and a real-time account of the writing life. (Without the slightest sarcasm or cynicism, it\u2019s the closest thing to a ... vlog ... for writers as I\u2019ve seen. (Sorry, Warren.))^10\n  * Laura Olin\u2019s newsletter \u2014 known for her Everything Changes newsletter way back in the yet-to-be-burning-world of 2015, Laura does the link-list format justice. And her Jobs Board at the bottom is a fine idea.\n  * Frank Chimero\u2019s FTC/ETC which Mr. Chimero almost never writes but when he does makes the day a good day.\n  * Jenna Wortham\u2019s fermentation & formation \u2014 rarely sent, but always appreciated, center-aligned prose poems.\n  * Clear Left\u2019s Clearletter \u2014 a superb example of a company having a voice and giving you just two or three well-chosen industry-adjacent gems a week. (A good counterexample to the newsletters that seem to think volume of links is a virtue.)\n  * FSG/MCD\u2019s Electric Eel for insight into what a publishing house can do with the format when they stretch out a bit and don\u2019t just focus on the upcoming season\u2019s list.\n  * Tim Carmody\u2019s Amazon Chronicles \u2014 following in the paid-tech-commentary footsteps of Ben Thompson\u2019s Stratechery. Tim very smartly ran a campaign to \u201cunlock\u201d the commons, to make the newsletter available for free for all if two hundred people signed up as paying subscribers. Well, that happened in a scant 24 hours. Tim\u2019s newsletter is a great example of what extreme focus (Amazon Amazon Amazon) and clear intent gets you: bucks in hand.\n\nThis list leaves out a mountain of others \u2014 we are, truly, awash in great-\nwriting-via-email \u2014 which brings us back to the top: Newsletters are having a\nbit of a moment.\n\nBut, why?! Why all this newslettering?\n\nAside from the sense of ownership and distance from social media, let me\nexplain why I\u2019m so attracted to them:\n\nIn parallel with my walking, these past six years I\u2019ve written another\nnewsletter called The Roden Explorers Club. And of all of my publishing online\n\u2014 either through this site or publications, on social networks, in blips or\nblops or bloops or 10,000 word digressions on the sublimity of Japanese pizza\n\u2014 almost nothing has surpassed the intimacy and joy and depth of conversation\nI\u2019ve found from publishing Roden.\n\nThis intimacy \u2014 both from my side and that of the recipients \u2014 seems to\nengender a kind of vulnerability that I haven\u2019t found elsewhere online. But\nthe intimacy is not surprising: the conversation is one-to-one even though the\ndistribution is one-to-many.\n\nYears ago, I helped build a storytelling platform called Hi (a simplification\nof its original name: Hitotoki, now shuttered and archived) and one of the\nthings I\u2019m most proud of our team having concocted is the commenting system.\nWe had tens of thousands of users and almost no issues with harassment. You\ncould comment on anyone\u2019s story and your having commented would be public \u2014 a\nlittle avatar at the bottom of the page \u2014 but the comment itself would be\nprivate. This allowed folks to reap the public validation of engagement\n(\u201cWhoa! So many comments!\u201d) while simultaneously removing any grandstanding or\nattacks. It wasn\u2019t quite messaging. It wasn\u2019t quite commenting. It felt very\nmuch like a contemporary, lighter take on email, and in being so was a joy to\nuse. Here\u2019s what the bottom of an entry looks like:\n\n\"Commenting\" on Hitotoki\n\nAnd so I use the word \u201cintimacy\u201d up above not in some dopey or saccharine way,\nbut rather to signal a dropping of artifice we are often encouraged to project\nonline. I would say Roden is not cool, in the coolest possible way. And the\nepistolary nature of email helps reinforce our shared humanity \u2014 the one-to-\noneness \u2014 we so often lose on social networks.\n\nFrom my end, this intimacy has profoundly affected what I\u2019ve chosen to write\nabout: Identity and multiculturalism, perfect laughs, meditation, great walks,\nartist retreats, and more.\n\nEven though I also publish Roden on this website, there\u2019s something about the\nframing of email \u2014 the inbox, that weird neither-here-nor-there networked\nspace \u2014 that unlocks a permission to write about things I wouldn\u2019t otherwise\nfeel ... welcomed? to write about. I don\u2019t know where I\u2019d pitch half of these\nessays, and when I start most of them, I don\u2019t intend for them to go as long\nas they do.\n\nWhich is to say, my experience with the generalized nature of Roden has been\nso good^11 that I wanted to expand in an even more deliberate and focused way.\nHence: Ridgeline.\n\nAnnie Dillard\u2019s \u201cThe Force That Drives the Flower\u201d, written in 1973, is\nstriking not only for feeling so epistolary (as is so much of Dillard\u2019s\nwriting; why it can hit the gut with such a thud), but also in how a passage\nlike this, might have been lifted from her Tinyletter in, say, 2016:\n\n> So far as I know, only one real experiment has ever been performed to\n> determine the extent and rate of root growth, and when you read the figures,\n> you see why. I have run into various accounts of this experiment, and the\n> only thing they don\u2019t reveal is how many lab assistants were blinded for\n> life.\n\n> The experimenters studied a single grass plant, winter rye. They let it grow\n> in a greenhouse for four months; then they gingerly spirited away the\n> soil\u2014under microscopes, I imagine\u2014and counted and measured all the roots and\n> root hairs. In four months the plant had set forth 378 miles of roots\u2014that\u2019s\n> about three miles a day\u2014in 14 million distinct roots. This is mighty\n> impressive, but when they get down to the root hairs, I boggle completely.\n> In those same four months the rye plant created 14 billion root hairs, and\n> those little things placed end to end just about wouldn\u2019t quit. In a single\n> cubic inch of soil, the length of the root hairs totaled 6000 miles.\n\nThat tonal mix of the casual, the literary, the scientific, an unfussy awe\nwrapped in smarts \u2014 this is what I open my inbox for these days. The\ndifference here is The Atlantic published, cared for, and made available this\nessay/letter from so long ago. As to the archives of our newsletters? That\u2019s a\nmore complex matter. But as Dillard says: \u201cI merely failed to acknowledge that\nit is death that is spinning the globe.\u201d\n\nA lot of this newsletter writing is happening, probably, because the archives\naren\u2019t great. Tenuousness unlocks the mind, loosens tone. But the archival\nreality might be just the opposite of that common perception: These\nnewsletters are the most backed up pieces of writing in history, copies in\nmillions of inboxes, on millions of hard drives and servers, far more than any\nblog post. More robust than an Internet Archive container. LOCKSS to the max.\nThese might be the most durable copies yet of ourselves. They\u2019re everywhere\nbut privately so, hidden, piggybacking on the most accessible, oldest\nnetworked publishing platform in the world. QWERTYUIOP indeed.\n\n  1. A limit to keep the messages from spiraling out of control for both your sake and mine. One of the problems I\u2019ve had with my other newsletter, Roden is that the letters can become so unwieldy, so wild, so ever expanding, that to even begin one is like preparing to dive down to some sunken ship wedged in a trench. And so by capping things around 500 words means I have an out, and a constraint to keep things focused. And with fifty-two weeks, any spillover from one week feeds into another. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  2. I worry about the defensibility of their platform though. And suspect MailChimp and the other biggies are getting ready to roll out subscription options sooner than later. That said, although Substack isn\u2019t offering, for example, substantially more beautiful templates than the competition, they do have an increasingly strong, and well-respected brand. I imagine they\u2019ll be an acquisition target sooner than later. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  3. Although, with \u201csmart\u201d inboxes, and pre-filtered slots, Gmail and other email apps are making it a little less straightforward than before. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  4. Although, this isn\u2019t necessarily the case in the developing world where email addresses are less common than WhatsApp or Facebook accounts as communication vectors. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  5. Not to completely disconnect, per se, but to shift it from a plan A, to a solidly secondary plan B status. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  6. And it has been. So good. So free of spite or cynicism. Perhaps one of the most joyful big-league social networks of the last decade. It certainly felt fresh \u2014 light, unencumbered by your previously bloated social graph or too many options \u2014 until just recently. Which is why it gained so much traction these past few years. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  7. I don\u2019t bring any of this up with malice. This is the contract we enter into in using \u201cfree\u201d venture backed social networks. They have to achieve scale and maximize profitability, often (paradoxically) at the expense of usability. Frogs boiling in water and all that. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  8. I understand the design dynamic that is supposedly at play: you\u2019re shown the second image if you\u2019ve already scrolled past the first. The problem is, 99.99% of the time I am certain I haven\u2019t seen the first. So it feels less like an aid to get me to see more content of accounts I love and more an intrusion, an obnoxious nanny state move with little real user benefit. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  9. That is: Extremely. Or even a Tokyo backstreet late at night. The silence that envolops central corridors of the city can maximally disorient a western city dweller. It\u2019s not an ominous, bad-things-about-about-to-transpire silence, not a silence before some horrible storm, but a true stillness, like standing in the woods with your eyes closed on a windless day. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  10. About three years ago (or was it four?) I really wanted to do a profile on Casey Neistat. At that time \u2014 when he had just begun his daily vlog \u2014 he was pulling back the curtain on a really interesting set of life challenges. He was starting a family, starting a business, and being creative with video every single day. It was showing us all the contexts of life, all the messiness. It was an act of heroic focus which would have been unfathomable, had he not been doing it all in public, in real-time. That daily rhythm of his publishing demystified the required effort (a ton). It wasn\u2019t a maybe Casey\u2019s working hard kinda feeling, it was a Holy Moses. This is what going for it looks like. I think his vlog, in the best of moments, became a true archetype of the consistent energy and gumption required to achieve a certain reach and output. Anyway, it was inspired and inspiring and when I think of the power of daily publishing, Casey all those years back, Casey where the first child was still on the way, Casey before having launched his startup, that Casey \u2014 the Casey of sleeping fewer hours and running more miles than Fidel Castro \u2014 swings to the top of my list. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  11. And so much better than just publishing on my website. Newsletter subscriptions are the push that RSS promised but never became. And CMD-R to reply is the best, most intuitive commenting system I\u2019ve yet seen. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\nThis essay, published February 2019. Thoughts?
