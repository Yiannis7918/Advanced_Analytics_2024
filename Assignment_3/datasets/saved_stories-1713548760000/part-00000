It is only a first step\ntowards climate-neutral chemicals.\n\nApr 19 2024\n\nBASF's new cracker furnace runs on electricity but still processes naphtha\nmade from fossil oil. (Image: BASF SE)\n\nThe chemical companies BASF, SABIC, and Linde have announced the startup of\nthe world's first large-scale electric steam cracking furnace at BASF's site\nin Ludwigshafen, Germany. Steam crackers are amongst the most important and\nenergy-intensive facilities in the chemical industry.\n\nSteam crackers convert fossil input materials into basic building blocks of\nmany products. In Europe, most steam crackers process naphtha made from oil.\nElsewhere, using by-products from fossil gas drilling like ethane is also\ncommon. The most important output products of steam cracking are the olefins\nethylene and propylene, which are the building blocks of most plastics.\n\nThe input materials in the cracker need to be heated to temperatures above 800\ndegrees Celsius (approximately 1,500 \u00b0F). Today, that heat is usually produced\nwith fossil gas.\n\n## Two electric furnaces, six megawatts\n\nBASF is now testing two electric furnaces, each with three megawatts electric\npower. Both use resistance heating, which is one of the simplest ways to turn\nelectric energy into heat. One furnace directly heats the cracker, while the\nother uses radiative heat transfer.\n\nCompared to some other industrial high-temperature processes, the temperatures\nin crackers are not exceptionally high. But, as BASF's Andrea Haunert\nexplained to me in an interview I did in 2022 for a previous article, the\nchemical reaction inside the cracker is endothermic. That means the reaction\nitself consumes energy that must be constantly provided.\n\nWhile BASF says it is testing the technology at an industrial scale, the\nelectric furnaces are still small compared to the gas-powered ones BASF\noperates.\n\nBASF spokesperson Thomas Nonnast told me that the existing Cracker 2 \u2014 the\nlarger one of two steam crackers in Ludwigshafen \u2014 has ten furnaces that can\neach process around 20 tons of input material per hour. The two electric\nfurnaces have a capacity of 2 tons per hour.\n\nThe project received around 15 million Euros in funding via a support program\nfor the decarbonization of industries by the German government. According to\nthe funding program, the total project costs are around 79 million Euros. BASF\nhad previously tried to get funding via the EU Innovation Fund, but the\nelectric cracker furnace was not among the selected projects.\n\n## Electric energy, but still a fossil feedstock\n\nElectrification of chemical processes allows using renewable energy and can\nalso increase energy efficiency due to avoided losses through hot emissions.\nHowever, it is important to realize that electric crackers do not enable a\nclimate-neutral and fossil-free production of chemicals.\n\nThe chemical industry uses fossil fuels not just as an energy source but also\nas its feedstock. Olefins and many other precursors of everyday products are\nmade from fossil fuels, and electric crackers do not change that.\n\nCarbon embodied in products like plastics usually ends up in the atmosphere in\none way or another. It is most obvious in places like Germany, where most\nplastic waste ends up in waste incinerators. Emissions from those waste-to-\nenergy plants are releasing carbon dioxide created by the fossil fuels that\nthe chemical industry uses as inputs.\n\nA truly climate-neutral chemical industry needs to replace its input\nmaterials. There are three options for this: biomass, recycled materials, and\ncarbon capture and utilization technologies (CCU) that make carbon-containing\nchemicals from CO2 and hydrogen.\n\nTwo very different CCU approaches exist to make olefins and other cracker\nproducts. One involves making naphtha from a Fischer-Tropsch process and using\nthat in steam crackers. An entirely different process can use methanol as its\ninput material. It is already commonly used in China, although not for climate\nreasons: Methanol is made from coal gasification, which is very emission-\nintensive.\n\nAs we have discussed previously in this newsletter, the methanol-based CCU\nroute has some efficiency advantages. While steam crackers may still be\nneeded, it is not clear how big the role of the e-cracker will be in a future\nclimate-neutral chemical industry.\n\n## Other companies have also announced plans for e-crackers\n\nOther chemical companies have also announced electric cracker projects in\nrecent years. For some of them, it is unclear whether they are still pursued.\n\nDow and Shell have received funding from the Dutch government for the\ndevelopment of an electric cracker. They announced the startup of a small,\nexperimental unit in 2022 but have not made any further announcements since\nthen. Dow and Shell have not answered questions about the state of the\nproject.\n\nMore recently, Technip Energies, LyondellBasell, and Chevron have announced\nplans for an electric cracker at LyondellBasell's facility in Texas, USA.\n\nAn industry collaboration called \"Cracker of the Future\" led by the Chemelot\nchemical site in the Netherlands, also planned to develop an electric cracker.\nIn 2021, the consortium announced that the companies Repsol and Versalis (Eni)\njoined the project. That was the last update from the project. Chemelot has\nalso not answered questions about the project's status.\n\nBASF and SABIC were originally part of the \"Cracker of the Future\" consortium.\nThey left it to pursue their own project - which resulted in the two electric\ncracker units in Ludwigshafen.\n\nAuthor: Hanno B\u00f6ck\n\nWant to read more stories like this?

They share a common conclusion: Carbon capture technology is unlikely to play a significant role in emission reduction in the steel industry. Only one Steel-CCS project exists worldwide, which IEEFA's report discusses in depth. The Al Reyadah project in the United Arab Emirates is a gas-powered DRI plant that uses some of its CO2 for Enhanced Oil Recovery. According to IEEFA, capture rates are only around 20 percent. Most existing steel plants are coal-powered. Coal-fired blast furnaces with CCS technology currently do not exist at all.\n\n  * Carbon Recycling International, the Icelandic company that pioneered CO2-to-methanol technology more than a decade ago, has announced a third large project deploying their tech in China.\n\n  * The German environmental NGO Deutsche Umwelthilfe and the city of Borkum have won a court case in the Netherlands, stopping a gas drilling operation in the North Sea.\n\n### You may also want to read:\n\n### How to make Plastics without Fossil Fuels\n\n### Do Ammonia Crackers make sense?\n\n### Unburning CO2: The Problem with Fossil Carbon Capture and Utilization\n\n### Making Glass without Fossil Gas\n\nYou can find this article online at\nhttps://industrydecarbonization.com/news/basf-starts-the-worlds-first-\nelectric-cracker-furnace.html\n\nSubscribe to the Industry Decarbonization Newsletter:\n\n", "frontpage": false}
