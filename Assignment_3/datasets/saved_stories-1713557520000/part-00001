Neuralink\u2019s goal is to enable individuals with paralysis to\nuse a cursor or keyboard with just their thoughts.\n\nIn March, Arbaugh demonstrated his ability to use the system in a short\nlivestream on the social media platform X. A diving accident eight years ago\nleft Arbaugh paralyzed from the shoulders down. In the video, he\u2019s shown using\na computer to play online chess. He said he also uses the Neuralink interface\nto play the video game Civilization.\n\n\u201cWe chose to partner with Barrow based on their extensive expertise in caring\nfor patients with complex neurological conditions,\u201d Neuralink said in a recent\nblog post. Barrow put out its own press release announcing the partnership as\nwell. The institute has more than 300 active clinical trials currently\nunderway and performs around 6,000 neurosurgeries a year. When reached via\nemail, a Barrow spokesperson said the institute is not conducting interviews\nat this time. Neuralink did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nNeuralink has been criticized for not publishing any peer-reviewed research or\nlisting its study on ClinicalTrials.gov, an online repository for research\ninvolving human subjects. Updates about the trial have instead emerged from\nsocial media posts by Neuralink or by Musk himself, who cofounded the company.\nThe company did publish a brochure last fall that provides some details about\nthe study, including basic information on how the device works and who is\neligible to participate. The trial site announcement, Arbaugh's livestreamed\ndemonstration, and Neuralink\u2019s recent blog post fill in some of those gaps.\n\nThe study will evaluate the safety and initial effectiveness of the Neuralink\ndevice. It\u2019s open to adults with quadriplegia due to vertical spinal cord\ninjury or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis who are 22 or older and have a\ncaregiver. An initial assessment of the safety and usability of Neuralink\u2019s\nsystem will be submitted to the FDA in the coming months, according to the\nBarrow statement.\n\nAccording to Neuralink\u2019s brochure, the study will take approximately six years\nto complete. A surgical robot developed by Neuralink will install the implant\nin a region of the brain that controls movement intention. The coin-sized\nimplant reads neural activity from 1,024 electrodes distributed across 64\nthreads. Those signals are wirelessly sent to a device running Neuralink\u2019s\nsoftware, which then decodes them into movements.\n\nNeuralink has launched a patient registry for paralyzed people who are\ninterested in learning whether they qualify for the study. The company says it\nis still in the early stages of the study and plans to provide additional\nupdates on Arbaugh and future participants.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Security\n\nHackers Linked to Russia\u2019s Military Claim Credit for Sabotaging US Water\nUtilities\n\nAndy Greenberg\n\n  * Security\n\nThe Real-Time Deepfake Romance Scams Have Arrived\n\nMatt Burgess\n\n  * Business\n\nGoogle Fires 28 Workers for Protesting Cloud Deal With Israel\n\nCaroline Haskins\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Rise of the Carbon Farmer\n\nJessica Rawnsley\n\n## You Might Also Like ...\n\n  * Navigate election season with our Politics Lab newsletter and podcast\n\n  * Think Google\u2019s \u201cIncognito mode\u201d protects your privacy?
