It sets out good practice on flexible working requests and will help\nemployers and employees avoid any pitfalls.\n\n\u201cThere are many types of flexible working such as part-time working,\nflexitime, job sharing, staggered hours, hybrid and home working.\n\n\u201cThe starting position for businesses should be to consider what may be\npossible.\u201d\n\nA study of 4,000 workers by campaign group Timewise found that half would\nconsider asking for a flexible pattern of work using the day-one right to\nrequest in a new job.\n\nThe Timewise chief executive, Claire Campbell, said: \u201cThe new legislation will\nhelp job hunters feel entitled to ask about flexible working options and\nrequests could start coming thick and fast.\n\n\u201cFlexible working and diversity and inclusion are interwoven, and businesses\nthat make the most of the opportunity could really open some doors to new and\nexciting talent.\u201d\n\nResearch by campaign group Pregnant Then Screwed found that mothers were twice\nas likely as fathers to ask for flexible working after parental leave.\n\nJoeli Brearley, the chief executive of the group, said: \u201cMothers are more\nlikely to shoulder the lion\u2019s share of the unpaid labour required to care for\nchildren and manage a household. As a result, they are more likely to need\nflexible working. Just three in 10 job adverts offer flexibility, limiting the\nprogression opportunities and earning potential of mothers.\n\n\u201cThen we wonder why the gender pay gap widens when couples have children and\ncontinues to widen further over the subsequent decades.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Employment law\n  * Work & careers\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### How women and younger UK workers are being hit by \u2018underemployment\u2019\n\n1 Jan 2024\n\n  * ### Nationwide rescinds \u2018work anywhere\u2019 policy and tells staff to come to office\n\n6 Dec 2023\n\n  * ### Flexible working can significantly improve heart health, study shows\n\n9 Nov 2023\n\n  * ### Ministers warn English councils not to adopt four-day working weeks\n\n26 Oct 2023\n\n  * ### Two-thirds of CEOs think staff will return to office five days a week, survey finds\n\n5 Oct 2023\n\n  * ### \u2018We feel we\u2019ve earned it\u2019: UK over-50s on switching to part-time work\n\n27 Sept 2023\n\n  * ### Burnt-out from work?
