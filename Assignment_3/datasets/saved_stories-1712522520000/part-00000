The latest\npolls show a neck-and-neck race between President Yoon Suk-yeol\u2019s right-wing\nruling People Power Party (PPP) and the main opposition \u201cliberal\u201d Democratic\nParty which currently holds a majority. This election will serve as a\nreferendum on Yoon\u2019s repressive \u201crepublic of prosecutors\u201d and his\nadministration\u2019s dismal neoliberal economic policies. One critical issue that\nhas been absent in the media coverage of these critical elections is Yoon\u2019s\ndecision to entirely subsume South Korea\u2019s national interests to Washington\u2019s\nregional objectives, particularly with respect to the Biden administration\u2019s\nnew Cold War with China and the massive expansion of the provocative U.S.-led\nmilitary exercises in the Korean Peninsula.\n\nYoon\u2019s complete acquiescence to the demands of Biden\u2019s aggressive new Cold War\nhas earned steady criticism from opposition liberal and progressive parties.\nLee Jae-myung, chair of South Korea\u2019s Democratic Party, has criticized Yoon\nfor \u201cCold War posturing ... [that] stokes fear and division,\u201d calling for\nSouth Korea to pursue its own national interests rather than allowing itself\nto be reduced to a \u201cpawn in the plans of others.\u201d Similarly, Cho Kuk, chair of\nthe progressive Rebuilding Korea Party, opposes South Korea\u2019s regression\ntoward Cold War-era diplomatic relations with China and Russia, which he\nargues are straining relations to the breaking point.\n\nNevertheless, in spite of the considerable opposition to Washington\u2019s\nimposition of its new Cold War on South Korea, Yoon has obediently rubber-\nstamped two years of virtually unabated U.S.-led military exercises at North\nKorea\u2019s doorstep, putting the South Korean military entirely at Washington\u2019s\ndisposal and thrusting it firmly in the front lines of the new U.S. Cold War.\nIn the continued absence of any meaningful Korea policy, President Biden has\nfailed to mention North Korea in his State of the Union address for the third\nyear running. Despite being the world\u2019s largest military exercises in\npeacetime, these war games have hardly received any attention in the United\nStates.\n\nThe latest U.S.-led military exercise, \u201cFreedom Shield 2024,\u201d mobilized more\nthan 300,000 South Korean troops alongside 10,000 American troops in a\nstaggering series of 48 field maneuvers \u2014 double those of last year\u2019s \u201cFreedom\nShield.\u201d These combined battle-ready attack and invasion forces carried out\nairstrikes, tactical live fire drills, and air combat and bombing runs at the\nNorth-South Korean border. Per Operations Plan (OPLAN) 5015 between the U.S.\nand South Korean Army, which envisages a preemptive strike against North\nKorea, these forces are armed, deployed and poised to cross the border\nliterally at a moment\u2019s notice.\n\n### Related Story\n\nNews Analysis\n\n|\n\nWar & Peace\n\n## The US Is Fanning the Flames of War With China\n\nU.S. actions intensify the danger of nuclear war in the Asia-Pacific.\n\nBy\n\n    Marjorie Cohn ,\n    Truthout\n\nAugust 31, 2023\n\nTruthout\n\nThat the United States and South Korea are ramping up provocations against\nNorth Korea is nothing new: Every U.S. president since 1945 has been\nantagonistic toward the North. Donald Trump threatened North Korea \u201cwith fire\nand fury like the world has never seen\u201d while Biden vowed the \u201cend of North\nKorean regime if it attacks.\u201d But the scope, intensity and frequency of the\nwar drills have been steadily intensifying and now far surpass those held\nduring the Cold War. The past year alone included:\n\n  * 250+ days of U.S. and South Korean joint military maneuvers, including almost every day between February and April 2023, compared with 30 days of North Korean military exercises over the entire year;\n  * 21 instances in which U.S. strategic assets, including nuclear-capable weapon platforms, were deployed to South Korea;\n  * 10+ UN Command member nations participating in U.S. and South Korean joint military maneuvers, and pledging to provide firepower in the event of hostilities;\n  * Attainment of a new record as the world\u2019s largest military exercises to date in scale and scope.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s defense chief has pledged to \u201cswiftly eliminate North Korean\nleadership\u201d as a pillar of the military\u2019s three-axis deterrence system against\nthe North, which includes a \u201cKill Chain\u201d preemptive strike platform designed\nto destroy North Korea\u2019s ballistic missiles prior to launch as well as\nselectively \u201cremove\u201d North Korean leadership. To further drive the point home,\nSouth Korea\u2019s far right President Yoon Suk-yeol has encouraged frontline\ntroops to \u201cshoot first and ask questions later\u201d in the event of any exchange\nwith the North. For its part, while continuing the customary line that the\nU.S. harbors no hostile intent toward North Korea, Washington justifies the\nrapidly expanding U.S. military posture on the Korean Peninsula as purely a\n\u201cdefensive response to North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs\u201d and its\n\u201cresistance to negotiations.\u201d\n\nEven conservative security analysts dispute Washington\u2019s claim, while experts\nstress that \u201cneither North Korean conventional forces nor its nuclear weapons\npose a significant threat of war on the peninsula.\u201d The combined United States\nForces Korea (USFK) and South Korean forces far overshadow those of North\nKorea, whose entire military budget is $1.47 billion compared to that of South\nKorea at $43.1 billion, not to mention that of the U.S. at $816.7 billion.\n\nOthers draw attention to the fact that, despite Pyongyang\u2019s rhetoric, North\nKorea\u2019s nuclear platforms are a defensive tool. In his speech to the North\nKorean legislature this past January, Kim Jong Un reaffirmed the self-\ndefensive posture and stressed, \u201cWe will never unilaterally unleash a war if\nthe enemies do not provoke us ... there is no reason to opt for war, and\ntherefore, there is no intention of unilaterally going to war.\u201d Even USFK\nCommander General Paul LaCamera has admitted that the North Korean leader\u2019s\npriorities are in fact \u201cregime survivability\u201d and \u201cpreparing to defend his\nnation.\u201d\n\nThree important points merit particular attention with respect to the ongoing\nU.S.-led joint military exercises within the context of U.S. foreign policy in\nthe Korean Peninsula.\n\nFirst, the driving force of the increasingly offensive U.S.-led joint military\nexercises is Washington\u2019s \u201chyper-militarized Indo-Pacific Strategy\u201d in support\nof its new Cold War against China. While the USFK notes that the military\nexercises \u201caim to bolster security and stability not only on the Korean\npeninsula but also across Northeast Asia and the Indo-Pacific,\u201d Washington\u2019s\nactions are in fact increasingly destabilizing. In addition to ramping up the\nscope and frequency of regional military exercises, the U.S. is deploying more\nthan half of its aircraft carriers to the Pacific in the coming weeks \u2014 an\nunprecedented regional concentration of naval power that is being branded as a\n\u201cshow of force\u201d against China and North Korea.\n\nSecond, the U.S. quest to leverage an ever-increasing network of global assets\nin its conflict with China directly drives U.S. military exercises in South\nKorea. Case in point is the increasing involvement of the United Nations\nCommand (UNC) in the U.S.-led joint military exercises. Despite its name, the\nUNC is not an organization under the control of the United Nations; it is in\nfact a U.S.-controlled military alliance organized under the nominal auspices\nof the \u201cinternational community.\u201d According to Tim Beal, a preeminent\nresearcher on U.S. imperialism in Asia and the author of Crisis in Korea:\nAmerica, China and the Risk of War, the U.S. has initiated a rapid\n\u201cmodernization program\u201d for the UNC in order to upgrade it to a key component\nof the U.S. military architecture in the Indo-Pacific. This effort entails:\n\n  * A multi-year push to revitalize the UNC into a \u201cformidable military asset\u201d and induct its member states to take part in military exercises in the Korean Peninsula. Some states such as the U.K. have already been sending combat troops to participate in joint landing exercises.\n  * Expansion of UNC as part of a U.S. push to frame the UNC as the core of an \u201cexpanded and repurposed global alliance structure\u201d that \u201cstretches far beyond the Korean peninsula\u201d to serve Washington\u2019s geopolitical aims.\n\nThird, U.S. military cooption of countries along China\u2019s perimeter requires\nthe seamless management of a network of multinational military assets via the\nU.S.-controlled UNC, the recent emergence of the U.S.-led Japan-South\nKorea-U.S. (JAKUS) military alliance, and carving out a greater role for NATO\nin East Asia that has, in Tim Beal\u2019s words, uncomfortable \u201cechoes of the\nEuropean imperialisms of the past\u201d along with Washington\u2019s parallel efforts to\ncreate a NATO-like bloc in Asia. South Korea, the U.S. military outpost\nclosest to China, is a critical linchpin in the network of U.S. \u201cforce-\nmultipliers,\u201d serving as a frontline launch pad for any U.S.-led war in East\nAsia. The U.S. has retained continuous wartime operational control of the\nSouth Korean military since the Korean War in 1950, and ensures that South\nKorea\u2019s 600,000 troops and 3.1 million reservists \u2014 Washington\u2019s principal\nregional instrument against China \u2014 are constantly combat-ready as the first\nwave in any such conflict. In his hearing at the U.S. House Armed Services\nCommittee on March 20, USFK Commander General LaCamera bluntly admitted that\nthe strategic value of the USFK in fact lies in the fact that it serves as a\n\u201ccounterweight to China and Russia.\u201d As a result, South Korea is being swept\nup in Washington\u2019s intensifying hegemonic war, even though there is, in author\nKim Sung-hae\u2019s words, \u201cno inherent reason why Korea should be an enemy of\nChina or Russia.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. is using North Korea as a pretext for its new Cold War against China,\nand, with its control of 40 percent of the world\u2019s nuclear stockpile, is even\nwilling to risk nuclear war to further its geopolitical aims. As Noam Chomsky\nputs it, \u201cU.S. policy is very provocative. Nuclear war ends everything, but\nthe United States always plays with fire.\u201d It is in fact the U.S., not North\nKorea, that not only fans the flames of confrontation between North and South\nKorea, but appears to be actively planning for the possibility of a new war in\nthe Korean Peninsula \u2014 an inconvenient truth that is absent from Western media\namid fearmongering about Pyongyang.\n\n##### Before you go: Truthout faces a serious threat after 22 years of\npublishing.\n\nTruthout has been a stalwart independent news publication for over two\ndecades.
