The\nnew policy came into effect for all artists in 1st April 2024.\n\nThe revised revenue scheme was announced last year, and means music will only\nbe included in the royalty pool calculation if it passes a threshold of 1,000\nplays in the preceding 12 months. According to a Spotify blog post, 99.5% of\nall streams on the platform are of tracks that have above that many plays,\nwith the platform claiming that these tracks will now earn more as a result.\n\nAdditionally, Spotify now requires a minimum number of unique listeners for\nroyalties to apply. This attempt to stop \"further manipulation by bad actors\"\ntargets people using automatic and artificial plays to ramp up stream counts.\nMeanwhile, \"functional\" genres, such as white noise, are being targeted, too.\nWhereas before these types of recordings could generate income from as little\nas 30 seconds of play, this has now been increased to two minutes.\n\nHowever, the change has been met with anger and frustration from some corners\nof the music industry. This week, United Musicians and Allied Workers shared a\npost on X which suggested those numbers could be wildly overstated, arguing\nthat 86% of all content on Spotify will now fail to meet the criteria for\nroyalties based on play count.\n\n> As of April 1st, Spotify has demonetized any track on the platform that\n> receives less than 1000 streams per year. That\u2019s an estimated 86% of tracks\n> on the platform. This new policy will impact small artists the most \u2014 the\n> same artists that Spotify claims to support.\n>\n> \u2014 United Musicians and Allied Workers (@UMAW_) April 3, 2024\n\nUnited Musicians and Allied Workers recently spearheaded the Make Streaming\nPay initiative, demanding fairer revenue split for artists using platforms\nincluding Spotify and Apple Music. The campaign is behind a new Living Wage\nFor Musicians Bill, which was introduced to US congress in March and aims to\n\"ensure that artists and musicians can build sustainable careers in the\ndigital age\". You can find out more about this here.\n\nWhile political and public pressure for better royalty payments grows, Spotify\nis looking to bring in more revenue to plug its own shortfall. Since going\npublic on the stock market in 2018, the company has lost money every year.\nJust this week, it was reported that the streaming giant has confirmed\nintentions to revise and increase its pricing.\n\nBetween $1 and $2 will be added to monthly bills for customers in several\nterritories, including the UK, Australia, and Pakistan, Bloomburg reports.\nThis is said to cover the cost of audiobooks, added to the platform late-2023.\nMore recently, video learning content was introduced to further diversify the\noffering. A new basic tier package will be rolled out for those who do not\nwant to access audiobooks, the first of several updated pricing options. This\nnews led to a 4.6% jump in Spotify's share value, although it's unclear what\nthe long-term impact will be.\n\nSpotify Music Streaming Music Sales Living Wage For Musicians\n\nMost Popular\n\nNews\n\n##### Tomorrowland Thailand: \u2018Nothing officially confirmed\u2019, festival\nclarifies\n\n2 How Allen & Heath\u2019s Xone:92 wrote a new blueprint for DJ mixers\n\n3 Akai unveils stem separation for legendary sampler, MPC Stems\n\n4 Tomorrowland is coming to Thailand in 2026\n\n5 The Top 100 Festivals of 2023, as voted by DJ Mag readers\n\n### Related Content\n\nTech\n\n### Spotify adds video learning content for music performance and production\n\nNews\n\n### James Blake announces subscription-style alternative to streaming for\nartists, Vault\n\nNews\n\n### Living Wage for Musicians bill aims to increase streaming royalties for\nartists\n\nNews\n\n### 86% of music on streaming platforms had less than 1000 plays in 2023,\nreport shows\n\nNews\n\n### Streaming now accounts for 87.7% of music consumption in UK, BPI reports\n\nNews\n\n### Spotify CFO departure announced, days after $9.3m shares cash in and\nlayoffs\n\nDJMAG\n\nback to top\n\nDJ MagTM - living & breathing dance music.\n\nThrust Publishing Ltd, Unit 3, 30-40 Underwood Street, London, N1 7JQ, United\nKingdom.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
