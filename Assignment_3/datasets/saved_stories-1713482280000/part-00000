If life made sense, they would\nall be older when they went. How did they get old enough to die?\n\nMy father\u2019s death feels like it was twenty years ago but it was more than\nforty-five. It races, like scrolling through microfiche, zzzzzip, and nothing\nanyone says can make this less awful. Well, maybe one thing: Kitty Carlisle\u2019s\nmother said the good thing about being older is that every fifteen minutes,\nit\u2019s time for breakfast again. Karen has tea, an OxyContin, and orange Jell-O\nfor breakfast now.\n\nShe is so sick and sad that it can be hard to be with her, but until I got\nCOVID recently, I showed up and listened. Most of the time that is all we have\nto offer, and it is enough. Come to think of it, it was also hard in its own\nway to be with her many times over the years because she can be a curmudgeon\nand contrarian.\n\nPlus, horribly for me, her three grown kids, who are all pretty amazing, were\nalso extreme achievers, which my son Sam was not. All those years until 2012\nwhen my son got clean and sober, she and I would be on a trail at Deer Park\nand she\u2019d tell me all about the grad schools her kids had graduated from or\njust been admitted to, and then ask what Sam was up to.\n\n\u201cAh, well, still living in the Tenderloin,\u201d I\u2019d say, a young father, scaring\nus all to death. But he was alive\u2014I was one of the lucky ones, and I knew\nthat, and this gave me a shaky hope. But I lived in the minus tide of long-\nterm fear, where most of life\u2019s safety and predictability seemed to have been\nsucked away to unknown places. All I had throughout were my friends and faith\nthat the tide would come in again.\n\nIt is so hard for Karen to stay alive right now, and we both know she is about\nto die, but when I pay attention, I see that this takes a back seat to her\nbeing alive.\n\nThe worst phase was one year when Karen\u2019s son was in medical school, and she\nrejoiced in recounting the details of his summer job as a runway model in\nMilan. She\u2019d asked what Sam had been up to. He was at his lowest point\u2014we both\nwere\u2014but he did have a decent job and a wonderful girlfriend and so I ran with\nthat. Then when grace beckoned to Sam and lured him back and into the company\nof some sober guys in San Francisco, I got to tell her the minutiae of our\nmiracle, and she cried with relief for me and we got to be two proud braggy\nmothers.\n\nIt is so hard for Karen to stay alive right now, and we both know she is about\nto die, but when I pay attention, I see that this takes a back seat to her\nbeing alive, stroking the luxurious fur of her cat, sipping her tea with a\nbest friend, watching videos of her grandchildren. And her face brightens when\nshe sees me; her light is still on in there, like a nightstand lamp between\nthose dark, dangerous lungs.\n\nSometimes when I sit with her on her bed, memories float up to her of our\nearliest adventures that I\u2019ve forgotten. Doing the Banana Dance twenty-five\nyears ago to accompany our folk singer friend at a bookstore whose carpet was\ntiled in young children, singing along to the song of the same name. Scantily\ndressed, we were a couple of foxes shimmying. Oh, did we peel.\n\nAnd another memory: When I helped out at the dance classes she held for\ndevelopmentally disabled adults every Tuesday for years, one young man told\nher later: \u201cI liked that girl. She was a helper, and she danced.\u201d This will be\nin the swag bag of general instructions I leave behind for my grandson when\nI\u2019m gone. Be a helper, and dance.\n\nThe small walk-in closet in Karen\u2019s hilariously tiny apartment is stuffed with\nclothes and shoes, heavy on Doc Martens. Recently while instructed to move\nthings around in the hopes of locating a clean tube for her emergency oxygen\nmachine, I found two heavy winter coats. I said, \u201cDo you want to give one\naway?\u201d She doesn\u2019t: It\u2019s been freezing and she doesn\u2019t know which one she\u2019ll\nbe in the mood for the next time she goes in for treatment, the dark gray one\nor the navy blue. I love that so much.\n\nIt now takes friends an hour to help her get awake, dressed, and down a flight\nof stairs, and the whole time she\u2019s in pain and gasps for breath.\n\nThe other day when I talked to Tom about how some days everything sucks, his\nroommate, another Jesuit, was listening on speakerphone and called out, \u201cYes,\nJesus was full of compassion for those suffering, but also says to look for\nhope one day at a time, to see that if the lilies of the field and the\nsparrows were cared for, how much more would we be?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s very nice, Jim. It would be easy if you were a bird or plant,\u201d I\ncountered.\n\n\u201cYou have a choice,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat are you going to focus on, Annie?\u201d he\nasked. \u201cAll the things that suck, or sparrows and lilies?\u201d\n\nI thought this over. \u201cCan I get back to you on that?\u201d As I\u2019ve said before, I\nhave a PhD in morbid reflection, and in a strange way it centers me.\n\nKaren loves to look through photos in her albums and on her laptop. The last\ntime we were together, she showed me photographs of the last extreme minus\ntide. Looking at the pictures, you can\u2019t help but wonder where all that water\ngoes. It looks as if it has all been sucked up in a great inhalation by a sea\nmonster; what if she gets sick of the routine and expels it all at once,\ncausing a tsunami, burying this gorgeous tidal creation and darling me? Will\nthese tide pools disappear forever someday as the sea levels rise? Luckily, I\nsuppose, we\u2019ll be gone, but our grandchildren won\u2019t and this shakes me to my\ncore.\n\nI scare myself with recreational morbidity by wondering when will my last day\ncome, and if I will be very afraid. But these are the wrong questions to\nponder. Watching Karen, the question is how do you notice your own life force\nnow?\n\nI have been with many people who were dying, and what is revealed besides the\nworry is all that they loved, both what they will miss and what still fills\nand feeds them.\n\nShe has a photo of herself with a walking stick on the reef at the last minus\ntide. She\u2019s smiling. She was always beautiful and loved that about\nherself\u2014she\u2019d been a model as a young woman\u2014and now she looks rather like some\nsherpa\u2019s favorite grandmother in her wool cap and layers of warmth. What\nbrought her here to this point? Well, what brought any of us here with her? An\nunimaginably complex and infinite number of intergenerational variables that\nmade her specifically herself.\n\nThe theologian Frederick Buechner wrote: \u201cThe grace of God means something\nlike: \u2018Here is your life. You might never have been, but you are, because the\nparty wouldn\u2019t have been complete without you.'\u201d Being at all, living, is a\nmiracle, and\u2014note to self\u2014 attention must be paid.\n\nKaren started planning a party on the beach a couple of weeks ago. She called\nit her last hurrah, a wake to be held while she was alive, with a few of us in\nthe sand with torches, barbecue, singing, she in a wheelchair that can travel\nin sand. But then the rains came and the party has been postponed. I\u2019d give\nalmost anything to sit with her in the sand one more time.\n\nI have been with many people who were dying, and what is revealed besides the\nworry is all that they loved, both what they will miss and what still fills\nand feeds them. Karen in bed with her cat and us, photos of her family; my\nfather happy as a child that last morning on the beach, wet pants and all.\nThose ornate ordinary times, the grip of a hand as you walk up the trail to\nthe car, laughing in spite of it all, vanilla pudding.\n\nI show up, and Karen and I look at things together. Sometimes we make each\nother laugh. Her imagination is intact, as are her flights of fancy and her\nglorious plans for revenge. I make her tea with sugar.\n\nWhen I last saw her, she told me a story about how once when she and her son\nwere about to head back to the car from the tide pools, they saw a coyote come\ntrotting out of the chaparral and run down to the beach, frolicking in the\nwater, running in and out of the foam at the shore, the way you would if you\nwere a dog, or a kid, as my brothers and I did when we were small, as some\nchildren will almost certainly do later today when the tide is in.\n\nTalk about the joy of living. Talk about life making sense.\n\n______________________________\n\nSomehow: Thoughts on Love by Anne Lamott is available via Riverhead.\n\nagingAnne LamottdeathFrederick BuechnergrieflossLovememorymourningold\nageRiverheadSomehow: Thoughts on Love\n\nShare:\n\n  * Share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)\n  * More\n\n  * Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)\n\n###### Anne Lamott\n\nAnne Lamott is the author of the New York Times bestsellers Hallelujah Anyway;\nHelp, Thanks, Wow; Small Victories; Stitches; Some Assembly Required; Grace\n(Eventually); Plan B; Traveling Mercies; Bird by Bird; and Operating\nInstructions.
