Here\nare some tips for both parties to ensure a safe and respectful traffic stop:\n\n### For Drivers on the Autism Spectrum:\n\n  1. Stay Calm: Try to remain as calm as possible. Deep breathing can help manage stress levels.\n  2. Use Your Blue Envelope: When the officer gets to your car, say \"I have a Blue Envelope\". Keep your Blue Envelope in an easily accessible and visible place, like the sun visor. When the officer tells you, slowly get the Blue Envelope. If the officer is unaware of the purpose of the Blue Envelope, politely request that they scan the QR code to learn more.\n  3. Follow Instructions: Listen to the officer\u2019s instructions and try to follow them as best as you can. If you don\u2019t understand something, it\u2019s okay to ask for clarification.\n  4. Waiting: When the officer needs to go back to their cruiser, you will need to wait in your car for the officer until they come back. You may need to wait up to 10-15 minutes. When the officer comes back, they will explain the end of the stop and will tell you when to leave.\n  5. Safety First: Always keep your hands visible and avoid making sudden movements. Inform the officer if you need to reach into your pocket or glove compartment for anything.\n  6. Hand Placement: Keep your hands on the steering wheel until otherwise directed, even if the officer is not at your car.\n  7. Flashing Lights and Noise: Remember that the officer may shine a flashlight in your car, may have a radio, and may have flashing lights on their car.\n  8. Calling Contact: In a situation where you feel overwhelmed or may not be able to communicate clearly, you can request the officer to contact your designated emergency contact.\n\n### For Law Enforcement Officers:\n\n  1. Recognize the Blue Envelope: The Blue Envelope is a signal that the driver is on the autism spectrum. Note the communication tips provided on the envelope.\n  2. Exercise Patience: Understand that the individual may need more time to process information and respond. Avoid rushing them.\n  3. Clear Communication: Use simple, direct language and give one instruction at a time. Avoid idioms or phrases that might be misunderstood. Allow drivers extra time to respond as they may need more time to formulate their response. Clearly tell the driver when the stop is over and that they may leave.\n  4. Be Observant: Pay attention to non-verbal cues that might indicate the driver is feeling overwhelmed or stressed. Drivers may exhibit signs of high anxiety, especially due to bright lights and noises like your radio. Individuals on the autism spectrum may display repetitive body movements or fidgeting and may have unusual eye contact. Additionally, note that they may exhibit unusual speech patterns, especially under stress.\n  5. De-escalate When Necessary: If you notice signs of distress, consider ways to de-escalate the situation, such as reducing sensory inputs (e.g., turning off sirens, speaking calmly). If the driver becomes upset, ask and/or consider contacting the person listed on the contact card.\n\n#### Creating a Positive Outcome\n\nBy following these tips, both drivers on the autism spectrum and law\nenforcement officers can contribute to a traffic stop that is safe,\nrespectful, and positive for everyone involved. It\u2019s about building mutual\nunderstanding and adapting traditional procedures to accommodate the needs of\nall community members.\n\nRemember, the goal of the Blue Envelope program is not just to facilitate\nsmoother traffic stops, but also to foster a sense of security and confidence\namong drivers on the autism spectrum. For law enforcement officers, it\u2019s an\nopportunity to demonstrate compassion and enhance their ability to serve and\nprotect all individuals in the community.\n\nThrough awareness, preparation, and empathy, we can all contribute to making\nour roads safer and more inclusive spaces.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n\nQ: Who can request a Blue Envelope?
