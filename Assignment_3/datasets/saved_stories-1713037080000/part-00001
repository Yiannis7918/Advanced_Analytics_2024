For a\nblog relying on ad impressions and affiliates to make money, this is\nsignificant.\n\nGoogle Search has a system that produces signals that their automated ranking\nmechanisms utilize to prioritize displaying original and useful content in\nsearch results pages.\n\nThis is known as the \u201cHelpful Content Update\u201c.\n\nTo date, there have been three updates officially named by Google as Helpful\nContent updates. These were released in August 2022, December 2022, and now\nSeptember 2023.\n\nTo dive into this and see if the data supports the narrative, I\u2019ve scraped an\ninitial sample of 150 travel blogs (not company blogs, specific travel blogs),\nand after removing those with no third-party traffic \u2013 I\u2019ve analyzed 103,\nlooking at estimated month-on-month organic sessions to determine potential\nimpact.\n\n## TLDR\n\n  * Overall more travel blogs benefitted from this Helpful Content Update than saw a decline. 54% of travel blogs saw a MoM increase in estimated organic sessions overall, whilst 45% saw a decrease\n  * 26% of travel blogs in the sample of 103 saw an increase in MoM estimated organic sessions between 0-10%\n  * 23% of travel blogs in the sample of 103 saw a decrease in MoM estimated organic sessions between 0-10%\n  * 4.85% of the travel blogs saw an increase greater than 100%\n  * Growth was relatively spread out across 1% and 100%+, whereas almost 40% of travel blogs saw declines between 1% and 20%\n  * Qualitative analysis shows some correlation between travel blogs selling guest posts, with sporadic topic distribution, versus focusing on a single topic\n  * There are some clear victims of algorithm crossfire in the sample, but all could make improvements to avoid being impacted this way\n\nThe win/loss data spread of the travel blog sample.\n\nI\u2019ve worked in the travel sector a lot, from 50+ SMEs through to a top 5\nlargest commercial airline, with the usual suspects, OTAs, and vacation rental\nwebsites in between \u2013 so I know how valuable and amazing this sector can be,\nbut I also know the \u201cother side\u201d to online travel.\n\nTravel bloggers were some of the first websites to offer \u201cinfluencer exposure\u201d\n10+ years ago, and a large number actively sell links.\n\nThe above screenshot is taken from a travel blog that saw a 31.66% decrease in\nMoM estimated organic sessions.\n\n## Travel Industry Perspectives\n\nThis is why I ask if the industry could have seen this update coming. In May\n2023 Google started to talk about Perspectives more. I wrote an article on how\nto incorporate perspectives on Search Engine Land (as I believe this is a key\ncomponent of future SEO success), you can read that article here \u2013 I also\nincluded this in my September 2022 BrightonSEO talk, on how to incorporate\nperspectives into eCommerce product pages (creating higher value\npropositions).\n\nBut a key takeaway from this May 2023 Google blog is this:\n\n> We\u2019ll roll out an update to this system that more deeply understands content\n> created from a personal or expert point of view, allowing us to rank more of\n> this useful information on Search.\n\n\u201cPersonal or expert point of view\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not against the monetization of blogs, but if one week you\u2019re posting\ncontent on African safaris, and the next the best golf resorts in Portugal...\nDoes it feel (or look) authentic? Can you be an expert in both of those\ntopics? Or can others online add greater expertise weight to them?\n\n### Travel Blog Example 1 \u2013 Negative Impact\n\nAs I write this, I\u2019m looking at the last 5 posts written by a site that\u2019s lost\njust over a third of it\u2019s traffic, and the last 5 posts (all written by the\nsame author over the past six weeks) cover the topics:\n\n  * Urban street photography\n  * 5 Reasons listicle on visiting Mexico\n  * 5 Reasons listicle on the best rooftop bars in an American city (in New England)\n  * A guide on Canadian visas\n  * An ultimate guide on visiting China\n\nAt least two of these, I would confidently say, contain sponsored/paid for\nlinks with exact match keyword anchor text to random companies that add no\nvalue/context to the article.\n\n### Travel Blog Example 2 \u2013 Negative Impact\n\nAnother example of loss is a site that\u2019s lost ~24% of it\u2019s estimated organic\nsessions, which is roughly 55,000.\n\nThe last 5 articles on this website (all published in a 28 day period) cover\nthe topics:\n\n  * 5 Reason listicle on New Zealand\n  * An eSim review (including promo code and affiliate links)\n  * A passport safety article with an obvious link to an AI tool\n  * An article on hiking trails in Canada, with a link to a \u201cfast payout\u201d page for a Canadian online casino... This is probably one of the most obvious and worst link placements I\u2019ve seen in 10 years.\n  * The 5 best car rental companies in New York, with a link only to one of them, mentioned \u2013 and specifically an exact match anchor for \u201cSUVs\u201d going directly to their SUV page... Hmm...\n\nNone of this content aligns with what Google is looking for.\n\nIt\u2019s not trustworthy, it\u2019s not coming from an expert... And there are clear\nguideline violations in action.\n\n### Travel Blog Example 3 \u2013 Positive Impact\n\nOn the flip side, looking at a travel blog that\u2019s seen a 51.43% increase\nfollowing the update, the content pattern still has affiliate links and some\nquestionable links... But over the same period as Example 1 and 2, the 5\narticles cover:\n\n  * A review of a specific luggage brand\n  * A listicle of best-checked luggage brands\n  * A listicle of best carry-on luggage\n  * A listicle of the best light-weight luggage options\n  * A listicle of hotel booking broker websites\n\nAnd if you look back further, there are random articles that don\u2019t talk about\nluggage \u2013 but there is a consistent theme tying things together. If I look at\nthe Destination guide content, the majority of it is focusing on the US and\nincluding affiliate links \u2013 and for every article I see covering Germany or\nSpain, I see 5/6 covering different areas of California or the West Coast.\nThere is a theme of expertise, with tangents \u2013 not scattergun topics.\n\nAlso, seeded throughout are articles 100% not targeting keywords, but personal\nreflections talking about learnings from the past year, the past 10 years...\nThere\u2019s a foundation of good, helpful content that the affiliate and brand\ncontent is then built on.\n\n## If You\u2019ve Been Affected...\n\nThe issue is, that there are a lot of websites like this in the \u201ctravel blog\nsector\u201d, and Google has to take a stand.\n\nUnfortunately, algorithms occasionally confuse bad actors with genuine\nbloggers, who might be monetizing their websites through ads and affiliates,\nbut nowhere near the extent of these others \u2013 who are clearly just spamming\nthe internet.\n\nThe rise of AI content generation has almost poured petrol on this bonfire,\nand the ability to create a travel blog and mimic maybe 70% of the content\nalready out there is so easily achievable.\n\nSadly there will be a number of genuine websites caught up in this crossfire.\n\nOverall, more travel blogs in the sample saw growth from the update than\nlosses... So if you have been caught in the crossfire, I would look at:\n\n  * How you\u2019re monetizing your blog, and whether or not the \u201cbeneficial purpose\u201d of the majority of your content is clearly to be educational, insightful, and informative.\n  * The publishing frequency of specific topics, authors... A lot of travel blogs are framed as an individual (or a couple)... It\u2019s impossible to demonstrate expertise and publish weekly on such varying topics.\n  * Consider if the articles being published are adding value to the conversation, or regurgitating what a lot of the internet already says about the topic (this is why Google wants unique perspectives!)\n  * Reviewing your collaboration policies, and ensuring they\u2019re in line with Google\u2019s guidelines. Genuine brands who genuinely want exposure from genuine bloggers will still work with you regardless if it\u2019s a follow link or not.\n  * Make sure you\u2019re regularly adding Perspective content that adds personal value and isn\u2019t just targeting keywords.\n  * Structure your content plan to show you\u2019re an expert, and not just randomly publishing different topics one after the other.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible that before this update has fully finished rolling out (at\nthe time of publication it hasn\u2019t), there will be some correction.\n\n## Other Useful Related Resources\n\nIf you have been affected by this update, or want to improve your travel blog\n\u2013 I\u2019d recommend reading the below resources:\n\n  * How to optimize content for Google Perspectives\n  * The Big Guide To SEO For Travel Brands\n  * Early Stage User Queries & Query Stacking\n  * Riding The Core Algorithm Update Rollercoaster\n  * How Travel Companies Can Adopt Micro-Moments for Better Content\n  * Travel Micro-Moments Guide: How to Be There and Be Useful for Travelers\n  * How micro-moments are reshaping the travel customer journey\n\nPost Views: 1,234\n\nShare\n\n  * 0\n  * 0\n  * 0\n  * 0\n\nPrevious Post\n\nBeginner SEO\n\n## The Beginner\u2019s Guide to Creating Content Hubs and Spokes\n\nBy Dan Taylor\n\nSenior SEO Consultant\n\nJuly 4, 2023\n\nNext Post\n\nInternational SEO\n\n## Baidu SEO Basics: Optimizing For China\n\nBy Dan Taylor\n\nSenior SEO Consultant\n\nDecember 13, 2023\n\n  * Get in touch\n  * Testimonials\n  * HTML Sitemap\n\n  * 020 3984 9931\n  * dan@salt.agency\n  * Privacy Policy\n\n  * Case Studies\n  * YouTube Channel\n  * Media & Portfolio\n  * Cadence Newsletter\n\nCopyright 2024 | Dan Taylor SEO & Organic Growth Consultant\n\n", "frontpage": false}
