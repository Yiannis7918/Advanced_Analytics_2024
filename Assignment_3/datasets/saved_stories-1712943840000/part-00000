File | Photo Credit: RITU RAJ KONWAR\n\nThe Supreme Court has recognised a much-felt, but less articulated right\nagainst the adverse effects of climate change as a distinct fundamental right\nin the Constitution.\n\n\u201cIt is yet to be articulated that the people have a right against the adverse\neffects of climate change. This is perhaps because this right and the right to\na clean environment are two sides of the same coin. As the havoc caused by\nclimate change increases year-by-year, it becomes necessary to articulate this\nas a distinct right. It is recognised by Articles 14 (right to equality) and\n21 (right to life),\u201d the Supreme Court observed in a judgment released on\nApril 6.\n\nThe judgment came in a case connected with the survival of the endangered\nGreat Indian Bustard species.\n\nWatch | Why is the Great Indian Bustard endangered?\n\nAn order was pronounced in open court on March 21, constituting an expert\ncommittee to examine the problem faced by the bird species whose natural\nhabitat and flight routes collide with power transmission lines in Gujarat and\nRajasthan.\n\nThe case had been posted for further hearing in August 2024. However, the\ncourt, unannounced, uploaded a judgment during the weekend. The text of the\njudgment mainly focuses several paragraphs on climate change and its\nadversities.\n\n#### Climate change and human rights\n\nLinking the right against climate change to Articles 21 and 14, Chief Justice\nChandrachud said the rights to life and equality could not be fully realised\nwithout a clean, stable environment.\n\n\u201cThe right to health (which is a part of the right to life under Article 21)\nis impacted due to factors such as air pollution, shifts in vector-borne\ndiseases, rising temperatures, droughts, shortages in food supplies due to\ncrop failure, storms, and flooding. The inability of underserved communities\nto adapt to climate change or cope with its effects violates the right to life\nas well as the right to equality... If climate change and environmental\ndegradation lead to acute food and water shortages in a particular area,\npoorer communities will suffer more than richer ones,\u201d the judgment said.\n\nThe court also highlighted the interconnection between climate change and\nvarious human rights, including the right to health, indigenous rights, gender\nequality, and the right to development\n\nThe judgment noted that the right to a healthy environment, safe from the ill-\neffects of climate change, was a \u201cfundamental human right\u201d.\n\n\u201cViolations of the right to a healthy environment can reverberate across\nnumerous rights domains, including the right to life, personal integrity,\nhealth, water, and housing, as well as procedural rights such as information,\nexpression, association, and participation... Unequal energy access\ndisproportionately affects women and girls due to their gender roles and\nresponsibilities such as through time spent on domestic chores and unpaid care\nwork,\u201d the court noted.\n\nThe court underscored the important role solar power would play in arresting\nthe ills of climate change.\n\n#### India\u2019s solar potential\n\nIndia urgently needed to shift to solar power due to three issues - One, the\ncountry is likely to account for 25% of global energy demand growth over the\nnext two decades; Two, rampant air pollution emphasises the need for cleaner\nenergy sources; Three declining groundwater levels and decreasing annual\nrainfall.\n\nAlso read: India\u2019s solar capacity: Milestones and challenges\n\nThe court noted that the country was endowed with vast solar energy potential\nand received about 5,000 trillion kWh per year of solar energy.\n\nSolar photovoltaic power offered immense scalability in India, allowing for\neffective harnessing of solar energy.\n\nIndia\u2019s goal to achieve 500 GW of non-fossil-based electricity generation\ncapacity by 2030 aligned with its efforts to be net zero by 2070.\n\nIn 2023-24, out of the total generation capacity of 9,943 MW added, 8,269 is\nfrom non-fossil fuel sources. According to the Renewable Energy Statistics\n2023 released by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), India has\nthe 4th largest installed capacity of renewable energy.\n\nA Flourish hierarchy chart\n\nIndia\u2019s commitment to transitioning to non-fossil fuels is not just a\nstrategic energy goal but a fundamental necessity for environmental\npreservation. Investing in renewable energy not only addresses these urgent\nenvironmental concerns but also yields a plethora of socio-economicbenefits.\n\nBy shifting towards renewable energy sources, India enhances its energy\nsecurity, reducing reliance on volatile fossil fuel markets and mitigating the\nrisks associated with energy scarcity. Additionally, the adoption of renewable\nenergy technologies helps in curbing air pollution, thereby improving public\nhealth and reducing healthcare costs\n\nAlso read: Fired up and plugged in \u2013 Driving India\u2019s energy security and\ndecarbonisation this decade\n\nDespite governmental policy and rules and regulations recognising the adverse\neffects of climate change and seeking to combat it, there is no single or\numbrella legislation in India which relates to climate change and the\nattendant concerns. However, this does not mean that the people of India do\nnot have a right against the adverse effects of climate change.\n\n  * Copy link\n  * Email\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Telegram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * WhatsApp\n  * Reddit\n\nRemove SEE ALL\n\n### Related Topics\n\nclimate change (politics) / climate change / Climate mitigation\n\n### Popular\n\n  1.
