(ADI) that can be used to introduce\nfundamentals of Software Defined Radio (SDR) or Radio Frequency (RF) or\nCommunications as advanced topics in electrical engineering in a self or\ninstructor lead setting. The PlutoSDR allows students to better understand the\nreal-world RF around them, and is applicable for all students, at all levels,\nfrom all backgrounds. Early learning in a hands-on manner with the PlutoSDR\nwill ensure a solid foundation for students to build on, as they pursue\nscience, technology, or engineering degrees.\n\nThe PlutoSDR Active Learning Module is a tool that closes the relationship\nbetween theory and practical radio frequency activities of the user. It\nprovides a personal portable lab that, when used with a host, can augment the\nlearning that takes place in the classroom. A variety of software packages\nsuch as MATLAB or Simulink provide an innovative graphical user interface\n(GUI), allowing intuitive usage and minimizing the learning curve, enabling\nstudents to learn faster, work smarter, and explore more!\n\nThe ADALM-PLUTO Active Learning Module is a learning tool for everyone.\n\nBased on the AD9363, it offers one receive channel and one transmit channel\nwhich can be operated in full duplex, capable of generating or measuring RF\nanalog signals from 325 to 3800 MHz, at up to 61.44 Mega Samples per Second\n(MSPS) with a 20 MHz bandwidth. The PlutoSDR is completely self-contained,\nfits nicely in a shirt pocket or backpack, and is entirely USB powered with\nthe default firmware. With support for OS XTM, WindowsTM, and LinuxTM, it\nallows exploration and understanding of RF systems no matter where the user is\nor when.\n\n# Introduction\n\nPlutoSDR is a self-contained RF lab in your hand. It's more than the\ncombination of a few parts, but to understand the capabilities of the module,\nyou must understand the fundamental operation of each part inside the module.\nDepending on who you are, and what you want to do, you may have different\nneeds, different wants, and will use different software. It's expected that\nmany people will stop when they solve their immediate problem and don't want\nto go any deeper into the stack. Before digging into the documentation, check\nout the module prerequisites, and try to think about how you will use the\nADALM-PLUTO.\n\nPlutoSDR will populate as a Mass Storage Device when plugged into a computer.\nThe presented storage device contains a getting started guide (info.html),\nconfiguration control for your device (config.txt), and licensing information\n(LICENSE.html).\n\n  1. PlutoSDR Users & students\n\n     * PlutoSDR users normally interact with RF signals with MATLAB, Simulink, GNU Radio or custom C, C++, C#, or Python environment on a host (x86) Windows, Linux or Mac or embedded Linux platform (Raspberry Pi, Beaglebone, 96boards.org, insert your favorite embedded Linux platform) over USB.\n\n     * If you want to see how to generate or capture RF waveforms, this is the place.\n\n     * Everyone should read this section, as it describes the device, and describes how to get the drivers and host software installed properly.\n\n     * Most users should find all the information they need in this section.\n\n  2. HDL and Embedded Software Resources:\n\n     * This material is for those who normally write custom software or HDL (for the FPGA) that runs directly on the PlutoSDR. This may put the PlutoSDR in different modes, and support different external USB devices (including LAN (via USB), or WiFi (via USB)), extending the capabilities of the device. This includes all the information to compile HDL projects, compile kernels, change to custom USB PID/VID and/or run custom user space applications. For example, you could set up:\n\n       * a standalone airplane tracking station which communicates to the internet via Wifi or LAN.\n\n       * a mobile terminal to emulate someone else's keyboard.\n\n  3. PCB and Layout Resources:\n\n     * This section may be useful for those taking the PCB out of the case and making hardware modifications, or connecting GPIO to different devices, or attempting to synchronize multiple PlutoSDRs together. Since this is pretty wide open, we don't have any examples of this - but we do provide the info needed, including all the schematics and layout.\n\nIt's expected that most people will work their way down through each section,\nreading and skimming most of the content. The content is in a constant state\nof improvement, so if you do have a question, please ask at EngineerZone, or\ncheck the help and support page.\n\nAll the products described on this page include ESD (electrostatic discharge)\nsensitive devices. Electrostatic charges as high as 4000V readily accumulate\non the human body or test equipment and can discharge without detection.\n\nAlthough the boards feature ESD protection circuitry, permanent damage may\noccur on devices subjected to high-energy electrostatic discharges. Therefore,\nproper ESD precautions are recommended to avoid performance degradation or\nloss of functionality. This includes removing static charge on external\nequipment, cables, or antennas before connecting to the device.\n\nuniversity/tools/pluto.txt \u00b7 Last modified: 22 Oct 2021 16:04 by Robin Getz\n\n### Page Tools\n\n  * View Source\n  * History\n  * Backlinks\n  * Fold/unfold all\n  * [ Back to top ]\n\n  * Legal and Risk\n  * Accessibility\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Privacy Settings\n  * Cookie Settings\n\n\u6caaICP\u590709046653\u53f7-1\n\n\u00a92024 Analog Devices, Inc.
