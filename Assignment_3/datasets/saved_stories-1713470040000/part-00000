Instead, the White\nHouse is going out of its way to keep Chinese EVs out of the U.S. What gives?\n\nThe key to understanding this seeming contradiction is something known as \u201cthe\nChina shock.\u201d American policy makers long considered free trade to be close to\nan unalloyed good. But, according to a hugely influential 2016 paper, the\nloosening of trade restrictions with China at the turn of the 21st century was\na disaster for the American manufacturing workforce. Consumers got cheap toys\nand clothes, but more than 2 million workers lost their jobs, and factory\ntowns across the country fell into ruin. Later research found that, in 2016,\nDonald Trump overperformed in counties that had been hit hardest by the China\nshock, helping him win key swing states such as Michigan, Wisconsin, and\nPennsylvania.\n\nUpon taking office, the Biden administration committed itself to making sure\nnothing like this would happen again. It kept in place many of Donald Trump\u2019s\ntariffs on China and even introduced new trade restrictions of its own.\nMeanwhile, it pushed legislation through Congress that invested trillions of\ndollars to boost domestic manufacturing. For Biden, the transition to green\nenergy represented a chance to bring good jobs back to the places that had\nbeen hurt the most by free trade.\n\nThen China became an EV powerhouse overnight and made everything much more\ncomplicated. As recently as 2020, China produced very few electric vehicles\nand exported hardly any of them. Last year, more than 8 million EVs were sold\nin China, compared with 1.4 million in the U.S. The Chinese market has been\ndriven mostly by a single brand, BYD, which recently surpassed Tesla to become\nthe world\u2019s largest producer of electric vehicles. BYD cars are well built,\nfull of high-tech features, and dirt cheap. The least expensive EV available\nin America retails for about $30,000. BYD\u2019s base model goes for less than\n$10,000 in China and, without tariffs, would probably sell for about $20,000\nin the U.S., according to industry experts.\n\nThis leaves the White House in a bind. A flood of ultracheap Chinese EVs would\nsave Americans a ton of money at a time when people\u2014voters\u2014are enraged about\nhigh prices generally and car prices in particular. And it would accelerate\nthe transition from gas-powered cars to EVs, drastically lowering emissions in\nthe process. But it would also likely force American carmakers to close\nfactories and lay off workers, destroying a crucial source of middle-class\njobs in a prized American industry\u2014one that just so happens to be concentrated\nin a handful of swing states. The U.S. could experience the China shock all\nover again. \u201cIt\u2019s a Faustian bargain,\u201d David Autor, an economist at MIT and\none of the authors of the original China-shock paper, told me. \u201cThere are few\nthings that would decarbonize the U.S. faster than $20,000 EVs. But there is\nprobably nothing that would kill the U.S. auto industry faster, either.\u201d\n\nAndrew Moseman: The inconvenient truth about electric vehicles\n\nThe president has chosen which end of the bargain he\u2019s willing to take. The\nBiden administration has left in place a 25 percent tariff on all Chinese\nvehicles (a measure initiated by Donald Trump), which has kept most Chinese\nEVs out of the U.S. even as they are selling like crazy in Europe. That\nprobably won\u2019t hold off Chinese EVs forever, which is why the administration\nis contemplating further restrictions. \u201cChina is determined to dominate the\nfuture of the auto market, including by using unfair practices,\u201d Biden said in\na statement in February. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let that happen on my watch.\u201d\n\nOne view of this approach is that Biden is choosing to sabotage his own\nclimate goals by cynically pandering to a tiny group of swing voters. As Vox\u2019s\nDylan Matthews has observed, less than 1 percent of Americans work directly in\nthe auto industry, whereas more than 90 percent of American households have a\ncar.\n\nThe Biden administration, unsurprisingly, sees the situation differently.\nBiden\u2019s team starts from the premise that decarbonizing the U.S. economy will\nbe a decades-long effort requiring sustained political buy-in from the public.\nChinese EVs might lower emissions in the short term, but the resulting\nbacklash could help elect Trump and other Republicans intent on rolling back\nthe Biden administration\u2019s hard-won climate achievements. Keeping out Chinese\nEVs now, in other words, may be necessary to save the planet later.\n\n\u201cWe ran this experiment before,\u201d Jennifer Harris, who served as the senior\ndirector for international economics in the Biden administration, told me,\nreferring to the first China shock. \u201cWe saw whole industries shift overseas,\nand Trump rode those grievances right to the White House. And last time I\nchecked, he didn\u2019t do much decarbonizing.\u201d Already, Trump is trying to turn\nChinese EVs into a wedge issue in the 2024 election; his recent \u201cbloodbath\u201d\ncomments were a reference to what would happen to America if Chinese cars were\nallowed into the country.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the Biden administration is giving up on an electric-vehicle\nfuture; it just means that future will need to be built at home instead of\nimported from abroad. Threading that needle won\u2019t be easy. Apart from Tesla,\nAmerican automakers still make the bulk of their profits selling gas-powered\npickup trucks and SUVs while bleeding money on EVs. (Last year, GM lost $1.7\nbillion on its EV business; Ford lost $4.7 billion.) Although the generous\nsubsidies in the Inflation Reduction Act are designed to speed up the pivot to\nelectric vehicles, U.S. companies\u2014including Tesla\u2014aren\u2019t close to profitably\nproducing EVs nearly as cheaply as China can today.\n\nThe most straightforward way to buy time is by imposing further trade\nrestrictions. But doing so effectively requires careful calibration: Expose\nAmerican automakers to Chinese competition too quickly and they could whither\nand die, but protect them for too long and they might remain complacent\nselling expensive gas-guzzling cars instead of transitioning toward cheaper\nEVs. \u201cThe sweet spot is where you prevent a rapid shift of production to China\nwhile also holding the auto industry\u2019s feet to the fire,\u201d Jesse Jenkins, who\nleads the Princeton Zero-Carbon Energy Systems Research and Optimization Lab,\ntold me.\n\nSeparating technocratic analysis of policy objectives from the vicissitudes of\npolitics, however, is easier said than done. Trump recently called for a 100\npercent tariff on Chinese cars; Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri\nrecently proposed legislation to raise that to 125 percent. Even congressional\nDemocrats\u2014many of whom are facing close elections in Rust Belt states such as\nMichigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin\u2014have recently begun pressuring the Biden\nadministration to raise tariffs further.\n\nThat isn\u2019t the only way political currents could undermine the transition to\nelectric vehicles. In order to compete with Chinese EVs, American companies\nmust, paradoxically, learn from Chinese battery makers, who have spent decades\ndeveloping the best EV batteries in the world. The U.S. auto industry knows\nthis, which is why in February of last year Ford announced a partnership with\nChina\u2019s leading battery maker, CATL, to open a factory in Michigan. Ford would\npay CATL to, in the words of Ford\u2019s chairman, \u201chelp us get up to speed so that\nwe can build these batteries ourselves\u201d and create 2,500 new manufacturing\njobs in the process. (Such partnerships are common in the EV industry; Tesla,\nfor instance, partnered with the Japanese company Panasonic to develop its\nbatteries.) Everybody would win: Ford, CATL, American workers, the planet.\n\nBut the backlash was swift. Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin of Virginia\ncalled the Ford-CATL partnership a \u201cTrojan-horse relationship with the Chinese\nCommunist Party\u201d and vowed to keep similar projects out of his state. House\nRepublicans launched multiple investigations into the deal, claiming that it\ncould pose a national-security risk. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who\nwas instrumental in passing the Inflation Reduction Act, has balked at the\nnotion that a partnership with a Chinese company could qualify for the\nsubsidies that that law provides.\n\nZo\u00eb Schlanger: Joe Biden and Donald Trump have thoughts about your next car\n\nPerhaps not coincidentally, the Biden administration eventually announced new\nguidelines that could disqualify the deal, and others like it, from being\neligible for some of the IRA\u2019s tax credits and grants\u2014a move that would make\nit much harder for American car companies to gain the expertise they need to\nproduce better, cheaper EVs. \u201cIt\u2019s ironic, really,\u201d Ilaria Mazzocco, a senior\nfellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told me. \u201cOur\nefforts to cut China out from every part of the supply chain might actually be\nwhat prevents us from competing with their EVs.\u201d\n\nHerein lies the Biden administration\u2019s deeper dilemma. Decarbonizing the U.S.\nwhile retaining a thriving auto industry requires a delicate balance between\ntariffs and subsidies, between protection and competition, between beating the\nChinese and learning from them. The prevailing sentiment toward China in\nWashington, however, is neither delicate nor balanced. That America\u2019s leaders\nare committed to preventing another China shock is commendable. But going too\nfar in the other direction could produce a different kind of avoidable\ndisaster.\n\nSupport for this project was provided by the William and Flora Hewlett\nFoundation.\n\nRog\u00e9 Karma is a staff writer at The Atlantic.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
