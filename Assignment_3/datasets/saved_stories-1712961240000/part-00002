We test economic theories of belief-based utility in the context of\nvideo-game engagement. Using data on 2.8 million matches from League of\nLegends, we find evidence supporting reference-dependent preferences, loss\naversion, preferences for surprise and suspense, preferences for clumped\nsurprise, and flow theory from psychology. We then leverage our estimated\nmodel and an evolutionary algorithm to find the information-revealing process\nthat maximizes player engagement. We find that the optimal version of the game\nhas increased game play equivalent to 43% of the winner-loser gap.\n\nYou may have unlimited free access to working papers.
