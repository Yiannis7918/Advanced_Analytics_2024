Given the hair-trigger sensibilities of interested\nparties, she seems to have been unable to state unambiguously that now-popular\ntreatments for young people confused or distressed by their sexed bodies are\nblatant quackery: keeping pre-pubescent kids in suspended chemical animation\non the basis of a single, discredited study; dosing teenagers liberally with\nopposite-sex hormones; or \u2014 when a child reaches the tender age of 18, though\neven earlier in other countries \u2014 empowering her to have major body parts cut\noff.\n\nInstead, time and again in Cass\u2019s report she is forced back into the conceit\nthat the most pressing problem for contemporary gender medicine is the lack of\ngood evidence for such interventions either way. It is as if a modern-day\nmedic had been tasked with reviewing the efficacy of trepanning, and then\nordered to defend her findings in front of fanatical fifth-century devotees.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that drilling a hole in a child\u2019s skull to release demons is\nnecessarily harmful, you understand \u2014 indeed, it may be the best outcome in\nsome cases. The main issue is the lack of long-term follow up.\u201d\n\nAlongside Cass\u2019s cumulatively devastating account of reckless decision-making,\npoor evidential standards, and patchy record-keeping at Gids and elsewhere, a\nwhole section of the report gently attempts to educate its readership about\n\u201cthe components of evidence-based medicine\u201d \u2014 complete with basic explainers\nabout randomised controlled trials, blinding processes, and the possibility of\nbias. She might as well be addressing an archaic people who have just emerged\nblinking from a time capsule, still convinced that disease is God\u2019s punishment\nfor insufficient acts of propitiation.\n\nIn a sense, though, this is indeed very like one group to whom the report is\naddressed: those clinicians, parents and patients immersed in bubbles of\nidentity affirmation, and cognitively isolated from any reasoning or evidence\nthat would confound their worldview. Perhaps unusually for a medical review,\nit is clear from Cass\u2019s overtly respectful tone and at times still-euphemistic\nlanguage that her aim is not just to inform these readers but also to\ndeprogram them.\n\nThe very first sentence of her report begins with a weary disavowal of\nStonewall-endorsed paranoias (\u201cThis Review is not about... undermining the\nvalidity of trans identities, challenging the right of people to express\nthemselves, or rolling back on people\u2019s rights to healthcare\u201d). Somewhat\nnonsensically, references to \u201cbirth-registered females\u201d are scattered\nthroughout the text, as if the author were somehow only concerned with those\nwith birth certificates \u2014 presumably an attempt to build bridges with child-\nlike souls still convinced sex is something coercively assigned to neonates at\nrandom. Generally, there is a sense of gingerly addressing a group of\nemotionally labile people who are not quite ready to face the whole truth.\n\nAnd no wonder: nearly every indicator of cult membership is present among so-\ncalled affirmative clinicians and their hapless patients. Among the most\ntelling signs are a fervent belief in a transcendent new way of life;\ninduction into a mystical world of occult symbols, flags and lanyards; the\nlove-bombing of new recruits with affirmative language and talk of \u201cqueer\njoy\u201d; and the replacement of traditional support systems (one Pride post on\nthe South London and Maudsley NHS Trust website \u2014 a hospital involved in\ncreating the new youth gender services to replace Gids \u2014 talks about \u201cthe\nfight for LGBT rights\u201d as something \u201cto be won against your family or your\nneighbours or whoever is directly around you\u201d).\n\n\u201cNearly every indicator of cult membership is present among so-called\naffirmative clinicians and their hapless patients.\u201d\n\nRelatedly, there is a lot of what cult specialists call \u201chate-bonding\u201d \u2014 that\nis, framing critical voices as evil enemies to be automatically discredited, a\nprocess which neatly shuts down intellectual curiosity while solidifying group\ncohesion at one fell swoop. A recent example of such attitudes was the\nintensely hostile protest last month at a clinician-organised conference\ncritical of child transition, purportedly led by an NHS doctor. When\nconsidered alongside other obvious signs of religious commitment \u2014 the mantras\nand incantations, sacred texts, citations of high priests, annual holy weeks,\nand so on \u2014 it is not hard to conclude that, for many in the medical\nprofession, transactivism is based on faith not reason. Consider, for\ninstance, the astonishing levels of religiosity in this 2023 publication from\nthe NHS Confederation, at one point encouraging \u201callies\u201d to \u201crecognise the\nprivilege afforded to them as a cisgender person and uses this to uplift the\nvoices of trans and non-binary colleagues\u201d.\n\nCults are not unusual, as human phenomena go; the unusual point is that one\ncame to control parts of the NHS. As Cass relates, again euphemistically, \u201cfor\nthis group of young people expertise has been concentrated in a small group of\npeople, which has served to gatekeep the knowledge\u201d. Suitably translated, so\nthat \u201cexpertise\u201d means \u201cpower\u201d and \u201cgatekeep the knowledge\u201d means \u201cdeflect\nreal scrutiny\u201d, she is effectively pointing to the fact that much damage can\nbe done in an institution by only a few zealots, as long as they are the ones\npresumed in charge of things by others.\n\nThere is no better evidence of this than the fact, also highlighted in the\nreport, that according to current NHS guidelines, a newly socially\ntransitioned young person can be given a different NHS number in alignment\nwith their preferred identity. As well as affecting the provision of sex-\nappropriate screening and other kinds of differentiated care, this change\nalone has made it very difficult to track long-term outcomes of gender\ntreatment. When first mooted, it would not have been hard to anticipate\nproblems; but such petty worries obviously paled in comparison to the thrill\nof achieving metamorphosis-by-bureaucracy.\n\nMore from this author\n\n##### Kathleen Stock: Inside Britain\u2019s new trans clinics\n\nBy Kathleen Stock\n\nAnother clue to the level of ideological capture emerges when Cass describes a\nproposed data linkage study, originally envisaged as culling information about\n9,000 patients from \u201cGids, hospital wards, outpatient clinics, emergency\ndepartments and adult gender dysphoria clinics\u201d, and so providing \u201ca\npopulation-level evidence base of the different pathways people take and the\noutcomes\u201d. In the end, the much-needed study didn\u2019t happen because clinicians\nin existing gender services nearly all refused to cooperate. (An inquiry into\nadult clinics has since been announced.)\n\nReasons for refusal included that the Cass Review would be politically biased;\nand that \u201c[t]aking part in a study of this kind could bring into question the\nintegrity of clinic staff and the relationships they have with patients\u201d. It\nis hard to imagine such a self-serving affront to patient safeguarding being\nconsidered acceptable in any other healthcare context. Another reason offered,\nalso with an apparently straight face, was that \u201cthe study outcomes focus on\nadverse health events, for which the clinics do not feel primarily\nresponsible\u201d. Once you have fixed the problems with a young person\u2019s soul,\napparently what happens to their body afterwards is not your concern.\n\nOne could be forgiven for thinking that medical culture should easily be able\nto condemn bizarre physical interventions performed upon children in the name\nof religion, without having to undertake a four-year clinical review first.\nIndeed, lawmakers have previously criminalised practices such as FGM without\nrequiring any such tests. But one instructive thing we can learn from the\nwreckage of gender medicine is that, with the right kind of institutional and\nrhetorical scaffolding, doctors can become unsure about what their goals are\nsupposed to be. It\u2019s no good telling them to first do no harm, when they can\u2019t\nwork out how to reliably detect it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no good telling them to first do no harm, when they can\u2019t work out how\nto reliably detect it.\u201d\n\nA superficial reason for this confusion is that the harms taken to fall\nsquarely under the medical profession\u2019s remit include negative psychological\nimpacts as well as physical ones. And indeed, this looks like the right\nresult: we can all think of obvious cases where mental suffering causes real\ndamage to a person, and going to see a doctor is an appropriate response. But\nthe downside is that, in a culture very picky about physical looks, or in the\ngrip of some other body-related derangement, a person\u2019s perceptions of her own\nhealthy body can cause her severely negative psychological impact too; and\nthen what is the clinician supposed to focus upon first? Cass herself talks\nabout the rise among teenage girls in \u201cBody Dysmorphic Disorder\u201d, an obsessive\npreoccupation \u201cwith body image and with compulsive revisiting or avoidance of\nthoughts to manage distress\u201d.\n\nAt least in theory, the doctor then has a choice: changing the mind to be\nbetter able to cope with the body, or changing the patient\u2019s healthy body to\nrelieve the mind. Cosmetic surgery opts for the latter strategy. Though\ndescribed as \u201cnot routinely provided\u201d, the NHS will sometimes fund implants\nfor uneven breasts, reduction for large ones, or ear-pinning, as long as these\nthings are causing \u201csignificant distress\u201d. This, then, is a case where\npsychological feelings are taken to justify an assault, quite literally, upon\nphysically healthy flesh.\n\nTransactivists tend to ramp up this strategy, often baselessly suggesting that\nearly physical interventions to change children\u2019s bodies will avoid\ndevastating psychological consequences and perhaps even suicide later on.\nInflated figures have been disseminated by mainstream sources for years about\nthe prevalence of suicide attempts in trans-identified young people, and\nweaponised in order to motivate medical \u201caffirmation\u201d. Dr Christine Mimnagh,\nclinical lead at the Merseyside adult gender service CMAGIC and a member of an\ninfluential Clinical Reference Group at NHS England for gender dysphoria\nservices, was recently caught on camera telling listeners at Dorset Healthcare\nUniversity NHS Foundation Trust that if child services \u201cworked as they should\u201d\nwe would induce \u201cmenopause\u201d in some nine-year-old girls before menarche.\n\nBut a deeper reason for medical confusion about what counts as harm these days\nis widespread acknowledgement that judgements of harm are often or even always\nvalue-laden \u2014 that is, that they implicitly depend on background assumptions\nabout what sort of life is worthwhile. People can put up with all sorts of\nphysical discomfort, on their own behalf or that of their children, when the\ncause is placed in a moral or religious framework making it look better than\nthe alternative. Some Christian Scientists will avoid all medical treatment\nfor sick children, failing to shield them from great pain in the process; some\nRoman Catholics will put their mortally ill children through invasive medical\nprocedures to keep them alive a bit longer. More mundanely, many parents\nvaccinate their children, circumcise baby boys, or pierce girls\u2019 ears \u2014 not\nbecause they are sadists (of course), but because they believe that benefits\noutweigh somewhat painful costs.\n\nSuggested reading\n\n##### The Cass Report's cowardly converts\n\nBy Julie Bindel\n\nAcknowledging that judgements about physical harm are not always\nstraightforward, and often depend upon background values, can make the use of\npuberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and radical surgery disappear into an\nethically confusing fog; and especially when the doctor herself has no strong\nintuitions about the prioritisation of bodily integrity over mental wellness\nto call upon. Certainly, there are other adults who swear that such physically\ndamaging treatments \u2014 for what else can we call them? \u2014 have made their lives\nbetter overall in terms of other goals: mental health, or aesthetics, or self-\nexpression.\n\nBut there are obvious differences when it comes to children and young adults \u2014\ndifferences that apply well beyond the age of majority, to at least one\u2019s mid-\ntwenties. One is that so-called affirming procedures are far more physically\ndebilitating, for longer, than things like ear-piercing, tattoos, or even most\nkinds of cosmetic surgery. Another is that each of them negatively affects\nwhat a recently published journal article has argued is a child\u2019s \u201cright to an\nopen future\u201d: roughly, important freedoms or capacities that can only be\nexercised as autonomous adults (such as biological parenthood or a fulfilling\nsex life), and whose value is unlikely to be recognised by an individual until\nlater in life. When Cass writes that \u201cthe central aim\u201d of treatment \u201cis to\nhelp young people to thrive and achieve their life goals\u201d, she does not of\ncourse mean the life goals they have now, but the ones they may well have\nafterwards.\n\nThe liberal ideal that each adult individual should be free to pursue her own\nconception of a good life, as long as it doesn\u2019t impede others from doing the\nsame, takes a bashing these days from both Right and Left. But one thing the\nideal can do \u2014 at least when properly understood, and robustly applied \u2014 is\nprotect our children from fanatics with mad glints in their eye, wishing to\nimprint their religious ideals, quite literally, upon children\u2019s healthy\ndeveloping bodies. In her report, Cass encourages a much wider range of people\nwith relevant specialties to get involved with the care of trans-identified\nyouth, moving forward; by which she presumably means, clinicians whose\npersonal value systems won\u2019t have such perilous physical consequences for\ntheir young charges. We can only hope that right-minded people answer her\ncall.\n\nKathleen Stock is an UnHerd columnist and a co-director of The Lesbian\nProject.\n\nDocstockk\n\n## Join the discussion\n\n### Join like minded readers that support our journalism by becoming a paid\nsubscriber\n\n### To join the discussion in the comments, become a paid subscriber.\n\n#### Join like minded readers that support our journalism, read unlimited\narticles and enjoy other subscriber-only benefits.\n\nSubscribe\n\nSubscribe\n\n50 Comments\n\nMost Voted\n\nNewest Oldest\n\nInline Feedbacks\n\nView all comments\n\nJack Robertson\n\n12 hours ago\n\nThe grown-ups are taking back control of elite intellectual public discourse.\nWatch the mediocre, the grubby, the rent-seeking, the creepy, the craven, the\nopportunist...abandon the always-minority religious crackpots and zealots.\nWatch these p*ssant enablers scatter, go to ground, melt away, frantically\nrewrite their backstories...watch them run, run, run like hell, far and fast\naway from gender affirmation therapy barbarism.

They don\u2019t want to\nbe female in a male dominated world. They realise with shock their future will\nbe difficult on so many levels. They don\u2019t want to suck boys willies\n(absolutely don\u2019t!) or be the butt of endless prurience. They are both\nprotected and exploited, denied full agency and mocked if they don\u2019t conform.\nAdd to this monthly often painful bleeding and breasts you didn\u2019t want which\nimpede your otherwise streamlined body. And then ....some people, your\nteachers even, say you don\u2019t have to be a girl if you don\u2019t want to be! none\nof the above is inevitable, you can change it. Take some pills...because deep\nInside you are really a boy! You bet. Form a queue.\n\nNow what is needed is girls to discover all the realities of their sex and the\nimpediments and fight to change the rules. Fight for equality of rights. I\nknow because I was this girl. I watched while my brother was allowed to ride\nhis and my bike with no rules whilst I had to be accompanied by my father\nalthough I had just passed my profiency certificate which brother hadn\u2019t. I\nremember binding my breasts because they brought too much attention of the\nwrong kind. I remember being chased and flashed. I remember buying a\ntypewriter because I wanted one but never telling any employer that o could\ntype. I remember being the only girl in the evening class for A level zoology\nbecause all the boys were going to be doctors and I was told I could be a\nnurse and finally settled in medical research.. but not a doctor. That\u2019s when\nit happened for me and I have fought it ever since. Which doesn\u2019t mean I\ndidn\u2019t fall in love and have children and fall out of love and refuse to wear\nstilettos.

To take just one, I believe in\nthe Roman Republic one did not get the vote until 25. We have already reduced\nthe age from 21 to 18 with a probability it will reduce further to 16. On\nKathleen\u2019s logic this is ill considered.\n\n2/ I think the problem of the authority we cede to \u201cexperts\u201d is a far wider\nchallenge than that presented by the self appointed paragons of the trans\nadvocacy movement. In some subjects, the \u201cexperts\u201d really do know what they\nare talking about but in others they are merely spouting some fashionable\ngroupthink. e.g. physicists vs psychologists. It as if we need two different\nterms. We defer too much to experts without real expertise who, at a minimum,\noverstate the confidence we should have in their views.
