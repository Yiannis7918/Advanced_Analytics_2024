Two of these were formed through a process called\nendosymbiosis, in which a once free-living organism is incorporated into a\ncell. These are the mitochondrion, where a former bacteria now handles the\ntask of converting chemical energy into useful forms, and the chloroplast,\nwhere photosynthesis happens.\n\nThe fact that there are only a few cases of organelles that evolved through\nendosymbiosis suggests that it's an extremely rare event. Yet researchers may\nhave found a new case, in which an organelle devoted to fixing nitrogen from\nthe atmosphere is in the process of evolving. The resulting organelle, termed\na nitroplast, is still in the process of specialization.\n\n## Getting nitrogen\n\nNitrogen is one of the elements central to life. Every DNA base, every amino\nacid in a protein contains at least one, and often several, nitrogen atoms.\nBut nitrogen is remarkably difficult for life to get ahold of. N_2 molecules\nmight be extremely abundant in our atmosphere, but they're extremely difficult\nto break apart. The enzymes that can, called nitrogenases, are only found in\nbacteria, and they don't work in the presence of oxygen. Other organisms have\nto get nitrogen from their environment, which is one of the reasons we use so\nmuch energy to supply nitrogen fertilizers to many crops.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome plants (notably legumes), however, can obtain nitrogen via a symbiotic\nrelationship with bacteria. These plants form specialized nodules that provide\na habitat for the nitrogen-producing bacteria. This relationship is a form of\nendosymbiosis, where microbes take up residence inside an organism's body or\ncells, with each organism typically providing chemicals that the other needs.\n\nIn more extreme cases, endosymbiosis can become obligatory. with neither\norganism able to survive without the other. In many insects, endosymbionts are\npassed on to offspring during the production of eggs, and the microbes\nthemselves often lack key genes that would allow them to live independently.\n\nBut even states like this fall short of the situation found in mitochondria\nand chloroplasts. These organelles are thoroughly integrated into the cell,\nbeing duplicated and distributed when cells divide. They also have minimal\ngenomes, with most of their proteins made by the cell and imported into the\norganelles. This level of integration is the product of over a billion years\nof evolution since the endosymbiotic relationship first started.\n\nIt's also apparently a difficult process, based on its apparent rarity. Beyond\nmitochondria and chloroplasts, there's only one confirmed example of a more\nrecent endosymbiosis between eukaryotes and a bacterial species. (There are a\nnumber of cases where eukaryotic algae have been incorporated by other\neukaryotes. Because these cells have compatible genetics, this occurs with a\nhigher frequency.)\n\nThat's why finding another example is such an exciting prospect.\n\n#### reader comments\n\n32\n\nJohn Timmer John is Ars Technica's science editor.
