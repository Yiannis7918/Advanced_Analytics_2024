Will He?\n\nwww.thebignewsletter.com\n\n5\n\nShare\n\nThis week\u2019s monopoly round-up has lots of news, as usual, including some\nvictories for the Antitrust Division, the government causing big health\ninsurance stocks to tumble, and a privacy bill deal in Congress.\n\nBut I want to start with a ray of hope for those who want to break up big tech\nand are tired of waiting. A judge in California finally has the power and\nmandate to take apart Google. Not in five years. Not after a long trial. But\nright now. Will he? Guest-author and antitrust lawyer Lee Hepner has written\nan important piece on the subject.\n\nLet\u2019s dive in.\n\nLots of antitrust cases, but where\u2019s the beef?\n\nTo understand the biggest challenge to the practice of antitrust, it helps to\nstart with a basic axiom of our legal system, which is the need for a speedy\ntrial. You can go back to the Magna Carta and find indications of that\nprinciple, or to Martin Luther King Jr., who wrote that \u201cJustice too long\ndelayed is justice denied.\u201d In 1970, Supreme Court Justice Warren Burger\nissued a warning to Congress and the American Bar Association: \"If people come\nto believe that inefficiency and delay will drain even a just judgment of its\nvalue,\u201d he said, it would \u201cdo incalculable damage to society.\u201d\n\nOver the last ten years, we\u2019ve heard increasing criticism of \u2018Big Tech\u2019 \u2013 the\nhandful of trillion-dollar giants that organize the information commons in our\nsociety \u2013 resulting in the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission\nbringing sweeping antitrust lawsuits against Google, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon,\nand \u2013 most recently \u2013 Apple.\n\nThese suits are popular, with 75% of likely voters supporting the Biden suit\nagainst Apple and only 16% of respondents in opposition. It\u2019s a tidal shift\nfrom just a decade ago, when most people still saw Big Tech as the crown\njewels of American innovation.\n\nBut these hefty lawsuits are taking years to resolve, with Google and Facebook\nsuits filed in 2020, and not close to done four years later. And that, as\nJustice Warren would have observed, is a problem, because it leaves a\nfestering impression that there\u2019s little anyone can do about market power.\nEvery crushed competitor, every cheated customer, they have to wait years for\njustice.\n\nBut a private lawsuit against Google\u2019s Play Store monopoly has received much\nless attention even though it could bring relief much sooner. In 2020, Epic\nGames, the studio behind the massively popular video game Fortnite, sued\nGoogle for illegally maintaining a monopoly over app store distribution on\nAndroid phones. Late last year, in a jury trial, Epic won, and next week it\nwill submit its request for remedies. And the judge in the case, James Donato\nof the Northern District Court of California, is a confident lawyer willing to\nkeep a brisk process moving. In fact, he has publicly encouraged antitrust\nplaintiffs to swing for the fences when requesting relief.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s a possibility, perhaps even likely, that one of the\nbiggest corporations in the world could be split apart over its monopolistic\nbehavior. And it could happen this year.\n\nSo when\u2019s the last time a break-up happened? Most people would say AT&T in\n1984, when the phone giant was split apart in response to a government suit.\nIt almost happened in 1998, when the government won a case against Microsoft.\nBut those are government suits. What about a private lawsuit? Interestingly,\nthe answer is actually... 2021, when a private plaintiff, exactly like Epic\nGames, won a case to break up a window and door making giant named Jeld-Wen.\nSo there\u2019s very recent precedent.\n\n###\n\nGoogle\u2019s Epic Blunder\n\nWhy might a break-up make sense in this case? The answer to that question\nrequires an understanding of the facts and evidence in the case itself,\nGoogle\u2019s acquisition history, and the purpose of remedies to unfetter markets\nfrom anticompetitive conduct and restore competition where it was constrained.\n\nIn Epic v. Google, Epic Games argued that Google is a monopolist of one of the\nkey gateways on your phone, which is the Google Play Store. With over 90%\nshare of the markets for Android-based app distribution and in-app payment\nsystems, Google controls how any other app developer \u2013 including Spotify,\nTikTok, Amazon, Facebook, and beyond \u2013 reaches users on Android phones. (The\nother major phone system, Apple\u2019s iPhone, is the subject of a different\nantitrust suit also brought by Epic Games.)\n\nAt the core of Google\u2019s Play Store monopoly is Android. Android is an\noperating system, the brains of the phone, and Google acquired it back in 2005\nso it could start cutting deals with mobile device makers. There are many\nproducers of smartphones, but virtually all of them (with the exception of\nApple) now use Google\u2019s Android as their operating system. Google doesn\u2019t\ncharge consumers for Android directly, but monetizes Android indirectly\nthrough its app store and other highly profitable business lines that are\nbundled with Android.\n\nOver the course of a 4-week trial nicknamed \u2018Fortnite Court,\u2019 Epic sought to\nshow how Google stops rivals from creating app stores that might compete with\nthe Google Play Store. Every antitrust trial is a morality play, and in this\nstory, Google was easily cast as the villain, with the judge sanctioning the\nfirm for destroying evidence relevant to the trial. And the proof Epic Games\ndid present was overwhelming.\n\nEpic showed how Google forced agreements on smartphone manufacturers that\nrequired pre-installation and prominent placement of the Play Store on\nhundreds of millions of devices. Smartphone manufacturers, like Samsung and\nMotorola, consented to this arrangement because Google gave them a lot of\nmoney through \u201crevenue sharing agreements,\u201d paid for out of Google\u2019s monopoly\nprofits that smartphone manufacturers helped secure. These agreements created\na closed platform ecosystem, or walled garden, around Google\u2019s business.\n\nGoogle didn\u2019t just buy off smartphone manufacturers. When major developers\nlike Activision, Riot Games, and Tencent became frustrated with Google\u2019s 30%\ncommission and threatened to develop their own distribution and payment\nsystems, Google launched a \u201cPlay Risk Mitigation\u201d strategy that included\npaying hundreds of millions of dollars to prevent them from doing so. Google\u2019s\nhead of partnerships Don Harrison estimated that there are now \u201cbillions of\ndollars flowing\u201d between Google and Activision-Blizzard (now a subsidiary of\nMicrosoft) as part of a deal to quash innovation by would-be rivals.\n\nAs a result, Google now controls the only meaningful app store for Android\nphones and the primary gateway for how any other business reaches consumers.\nIts 30% commissions on all app sales and in-app payments is not a competitive\nprice, but a monopoly price it extracts while preventing rival stores from\nundercutting it. By comparison, Epic\u2019s Game Store proposed a commission of\njust 12%, a far more attractive rate for developers that would likely have\nresulted in lower prices for consumers, too \u2013 if Epic could have gotten its\nfoot in the door.\n\nThe financial incentive for Google to prevent companies like Epic, Activision,\nSpotify and Tencent from undercutting its monopoly profits is significant. In\n2008, Google said that it had no intent to operate the Google Play Store as a\nprofit center. By 2020, the Google Play Store was, on its own, one of the most\nprofitable business segments in the world, with a 65 percent operating margin\nand $4.4 billion in half-year profit.\n\nA jury found the evidence in Epic v. Google compelling, deliberating for just\nunder 4 hours before reaching a unanimous verdict that Google is an illegal\nmonopolist.\n\nBut the question at hand now is, so what? And that\u2019s what makes this situation\nso interesting.\n\n###\n\nA Verdict and $3 Can Buy You a Cup of Coffee\n\nSo far, what we know is that Google got dinged by a jury. But absent a remedy\nthat fully wrests control of the market from Google\u2019s monopoly, that verdict\nonly exists on paper. Such a remedy can be broad-based, anything from monetary\ndamages to break-ups to creating internal compliance departments to voiding\nunlawful contracts to banning senior executives from the industry.\n\nEpic Games is, conspicuously, not asking for money, but for the right to\ncompete on a level playing field. Before Google bought Android and converted\nit into a chokepoint in the value chain between device manufacturers and\nconsumers, Android was an open-source operating system. That\u2019s what Epic has\nstated it is seeking to restore, the openness of the Android ecosystem for the\nbenefit of all developers and consumers.\n\nForcing Google to spinoff Android may be the cleanest way to achieve this goal\nand blow open a lane for new competition and innovation to occur. Developers\nother than Google could seek arrangements with Android that simultaneously\nincrease the quality and diversity of apps, lower costs for developers and\nconsumers, and encourage smartphone innovation. At the dawn of artificial\nintelligence, a structural separation of Android would also loosen Google\u2019s\ngrip on innovation at the relative infancy of that technology.\n\nThough a breakup of Google might sound radical, it\u2019s a fairly orthodox remedy\nfor an illegal monopoly. Six decades ago, the Supreme Court described\n\u201cdivestiture\u201d \u2013 a type of structural remedy that includes breakups \u2013 as \u201cthe\nmost important of remedies. It is simple, relatively easy to administer, and\nsure.\u201d Ten years later, the Supreme Court reiterated the core purpose of\nantitrust relief to \u201cunfetter a market from anti-competitive conduct and \u2018pry\nopen to competition a market that has been closed by defendants\u2019 illegal\nrestraints.\u201d\n\nWhile they\u2019ve become less favored in recent decades, breakups have\nhistorically been successful. In 1911, Standard Oil was broken into 34\nseparate companies, leading to, among other things, the commercialization of\ngasoline. In the 1940s, the Paramount Decrees broke up film production studios\nfrom movie theater chains, ushering in a new golden era of cinema over the\nfollowing decades.\n\nAnd then there was the 1982 breakup of AT&T into seven regional telephone\nnetworks, and the vertical separation of those local networks from the rest of\nthe Bell System. That breakup led to an explosion of competition and\ninnovation among telephone device manufacturers and long-distance\ntelecommunications providers \u2013 and lower prices for consumers. A similar\npositive outcome would flow from a structural separation of Google and\nAndroid, which would blow open the smartphone field for innovation among\ndevelopers and device manufacturers currently under Google\u2019s thumb.\n\nBreakups are particularly effective where, as with Google and Android, the\nimplicated business segments have natural fault lines and can effectively\nstand alone. This is often the case with monopolies that were the result of\nmergers \u2013 again, like the merger of Google and Android \u2013 which combine\ninherently distinct business segments, and which remain visibly distinct.\n(Jeld-Wen was an unwinding of a merger.)\n\nBy comparison, the costs associated with ineffective behavioral remedies are\nsignificant, such as monitoring for compliance, addressing evasion, chilled\ninnovation by the constrained actor, and the costs of hampering a company\u2019s\nability to adapt to market conditions. More fundamentally, an ineffective\nremedy is justice delayed, which as Justice Warren said so many years ago, is\ncorrosive to society. Both FTC Chair Lina Khan and DOJ Antitrust Chief\nJonathan Kanter have made clear their aversion to behavioral remedies and an\nintent to \u201cpursue structural remedies in our conduct cases whenever possible.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s pretty obvious big tech firms see laws as suggestions. In recent months,\nApple has drawn criticism for its \u201cmalicious non-compliance\u201d with new European\nUnion regulations and a court order in Epic\u2019s separate app store case against\nApple. In the latter case, Apple was ordered to allow developers to use third-\nparty payment systems, but is undercutting would-be competition by taking a\n27% commission for facilitating those transactions. Google too is under\ninvestigation in Europe for similar behavior in refusing to comply with the\nlaw. As long as Google retains control over the Android operating system, it\nwould do the same.\n\n###\n\nThe Courage to Provide Effective Relief\n\nSo how is Judge Donato thinking about the problem? At a recent status\nconference in Epic v. Google, he made clear his aversion to behavioral\nremedies that would require ongoing court supervision or otherwise result in\nawkward micromanagement of Google: \u201cI\u2019m not going to say \u2018you can have four\nclick screens, not eight.\u201d He added, \u201cI have great doubts I\u2019m in any position\nto set a fee that developers might pay.\u201d Moreover, he is curious about the\nbehavior of other dominant tech firms in response to remedies that seem to\nhave failed. (\u201cWhat did Apple just do?\u201d he asked, about malicious non-\ncompliance over the judicial order in Epic\u2019s other antitrust case.)\n\nEpic has a clear opportunity to request structural remedies and Judge Donato\nhas broad latitude to grant them. If Epic doesn\u2019t call for Google to spin off\nAndroid, it may still call for other forms of structural relief, like\ncompulsory licensing of core tech infrastructure, that could go a long way to\nrestoring competition to broader markets. We\u2019ll know Epic\u2019s request soon\nenough, Google will file its own more limited proposal, and dueling economic\nexperts will jump in another of Judge Donato\u2019s \u201chot tubs\u201d at the end of May.\nShortly thereafter, Judge Donato will decide how and whether Google\u2019s vice\ngrip over the Android ecosystem should be meaningfully weakened.\n\nWhy is all of this important? Innovation, whether on smartphones or tablets or\naugmented reality headsets, works best when wrested from the control of\nmonopolists whose overriding motivation is the preservation of their monopoly.\nWe all benefit when companies are forced to differentiate themselves by\noffering new and better products, or, at the very least, the same old things\nat lower prices.\n\nFor its part, Epic has a powerful verdict in hand. For it to be more than\npyrrhic, remedies must now accomplish several goals: they must unfetter the\nmarket from monopoly power, they must deprive the monopolist of the spoils of\nits illegal conduct, and they must provide certainty that the monopoly will\nnot re-emerge.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, Judge Donato has the ability to help Americans\nunderstand that the rule of law actually means something, and that when a jury\nsays that a giant firm has broken the law, the wrongdoing will be remedied.\nGiven that mandate, the biggest impediment to an effective remedy is lacking\nthe temerity to impose one that may actually work.\n\nAnd now for the monopoly related news of the week.\n\n## Keep reading with a 7-day free trial\n\nSubscribe to BIG by Matt Stoller to keep reading this post and get 7 days of\nfree access to the full post archives.\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
