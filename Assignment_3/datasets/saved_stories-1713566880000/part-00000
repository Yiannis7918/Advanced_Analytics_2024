My general\nthoughts in \"very useful\" stream-of-consciousness type posts? Coding\ntutorials, given that's my \"professional background\"? Book and TV show reviews\nwhere I share my \"wise insights\" into pop culture? Maybe I will touch on any\nor all of those later, but for now I just want to share where I'm at.\n\nEssentially, I will do tiny projects expecting them to fail.\n\nI hope this will be an antidote against my near-obsession with overthinking,\noverplanning, overanalyzing and ultimately not nearly enough doing. It's long\nbeen the case that the most comfortable place for me to exist is in my own\nhead, where the difficult and unpleasant (if not terrifying and horrifying)\naspects of reality can be ignored. But clearly something is missing when I'm\njust meandering from thought to thought. And doing tiny projects expecting\nthem to fail is a step away from my thought-prison.\n\nObviously, \"do tiny projects expecting them to fail\" isn't a particularly new\nidea. Since the dawn of time, humans and generally pretty much all life has\nbeen based on trial and error. Try something new; fail; learn; try again a\nslightly better way. From early bacteria to modern man, all of it seems to be\nbased on trial and error. Sure, humans are doing it in infinitely more complex\nand intricate ways than bacteria ever could, but to me there's surprising\nsimilarities at the root of it. Try something new; fail; learn; try again a\nslightly better way: from corporations to institutions to each person's\njourney through each day.\n\nThere is certainly much more to being human than just that cycle, something\nincredibly special about humans compared to the rest of life. I'm still\nfiguring that part out myself, but language and especially storytelling seems\nto be a key part of it. But for the purposes of this post and my short term\nplan, I will focus on this cycle and my relation to it. I can \"unravel the\nsecrets of humanity and the universe\" another time.\n\nWhen I am lost in my thoughts, I am breaking the try; fail; learn; try again\ncycle. Instead it looks more like try; fail; think about how I failed; think\neven more, taking it even more personally; think about why I am thinking so\nmuch; think; think; ... realize what I'm doing; try; fail; think ....\n\nWriting it out, it seems pretty clear to me where the problem originates. In\nthe day to day, it is much more subtle and difficult to catch. A core part of\nthe problem is associating a failure of a project with my personality or\ncharacter, not as a natural part of the process. Taking failures personally\nand ruminating on them has cost me literal months of time, and if I'm not\ncareful can cost me many more.\n\nThis distinction between \"I failed\" and \"the project failed\" was highlighted\nto me in an excellent conversation between Youtubers Dr. K and Pirate\nSoftware. Pretty much all of the insight and wisdom I am trying to channel in\nthis post comes from this video. I highly recommend watching the entire video\nif you have the time, but a core part of their discussion is agreeing that\nframing failures as \"the project failed\" is infinitely more helpful than\nviewing it as \"I failed\". The former enables learning and moving on to the\nnext project to try while the latter has enabled me to sink deeper and deeper\ninto a thought-prison.\n\nTo come back to my goal, \"do tiny projects expecting them to fail\" highlights\nto me that projects failing is the natural way of things, and that learning\nwhat I can and moving on to the next project is a better reaction than\noverthinking endlessly. The projects being framed as \"tiny\" further helps\nspeed up the learning cycle by making it easier to start each new project,\nknowing the end goal is not only in sight, but close at hand. Lastly, if a\nproject actually does succeed, it would be a nice surprise (although I might\nlearn less from it than if it didn't go according to plan).\n\nA lot of this post has been pretty specific to my difficulties and what I need\nto do for me to grow, but I hope it inspires you to action as well. If you are\nfeeling stuck (as I have been for a while now), I hope you also give \"do tiny\nprojects expecting them to fail\" a try. I promise it will be worth it.\n\nI'll update post updates here and on my youtube as I pursue this goal/framing\nover the next days/weeks/months(/years?). I can already feel some excitement\nand freedom and aliveness just thinking about what tiny projects I'll work on\nand which will very likely fail, but in a good way.\n\nAgain, feel free to reach out to me at gueejla@gmail.com with any comments or\nsuggestions.\n\nAnd again, I wish you all the best in your projects big and small.\n\nTake care,\n\n\u2013 Greg\n\n#### Greg\n\nApr 17, 2024\n\nprojects\n\ngueejla \u00a9 2024.
