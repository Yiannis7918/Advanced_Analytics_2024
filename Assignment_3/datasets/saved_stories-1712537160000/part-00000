Satellite cloud\nretrievals have so far not taken into account the lunar shadow, hindering a\nreliable spaceborne assessment of the eclipse-induced cloud evolution. Here we\nuse satellite cloud measurements during three solar eclipses between 2005 and\n2016 that have been corrected for the partial lunar shadow together with\nlarge-eddy simulations to analyze the eclipse-induced cloud evolution. Our\ncorrected data reveal that, over cooling land surfaces, shallow cumulus clouds\nstart to disappear at very small solar obscurations (~15%). Our simulations\nexplain that the cloud response was delayed and was initiated at even smaller\nsolar obscurations. We demonstrate that neglecting the disappearance of clouds\nduring a solar eclipse could lead to a considerable overestimation of the\neclipse-related reduction of net incoming solar radiation. These findings\nshould spur cloud model simulations of the direct consequences of sunlight-\nintercepting geoengineering proposals, for which our results serve as a unique\nbenchmark.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### Five million years of Antarctic Circumpolar Current strength variability\n\nArticle Open access 27 March 2024\n\nFrank Lamy, Gisela Winckler, ...

This type of\n(solar) geoengineering is based on placing sun shields or reflecting particles\nin space between the Earth and the Sun^5,6,7,8,9,10, or on the injection of\naerosols into the stratosphere^11,12. General circulation models (GCMs)\nsuggest that an insolation reduction of 3.5\u20135.0% can largely undo the global\ntemperature rise and intensified hydrological cycle associated with a\nquadrupled pre-industrial CO_2 concentration^13,14,15,16. However, those GCMs\nalso predict latitudinal variations in temperature response, and an extra\nreduction of precipitation in the tropics. Moreover, although clouds play a\nvital role in the Earth\u2019s radiation balance^17, the impact of solar dimming on\nclouds is still poorly understood^18,19,20,21. GCMs modeling the response to\n(extraterrestrial) dimming of sunlight are based on idealized scenarios^22.\nThey inherently suffer from uncertainties^23, mainly focus on the long-term\nimpact, and highly parameterize short-term and small-scale processes such as\ncloud formation^20,23. Twice a year on average, for a few hours the\nopportunity arises to take measurements of the Earth experiencing gradual\ninsolation reductions from 0 to nearly 100%, during the partial phase of a\nsolar eclipse. Although the time scales involved with solar geoengineering\nwill most likely not be equivalent to those of solar eclipses, these\nmeasurements can help to better understand (and test models that predict) the\nimmediate cloud response to the deployment of sunlight intercepting material.\n\nGround-based meteorological observations during solar eclipses have primarily\nfocused on fast drops in air temperature, winds and turbulence, and on\nchanging (photo)chemistry^24,25. Weather publications contain anecdotal\ndescriptions of dissipating low-level cumulus clouds right before totality,\nwhile mid- and high-level clouds survived^26,27. The timing of the eclipse-\ninduced effect on cumulus clouds is difficult to quantify with ground-based\nmeasurements due to the chaotic nature of cumulus cloud evolution and the\nmissing observation of the non-eclipse state, and atmospheric model studies of\neclipses did not yet analyze the cumulus cloud sensitivity^28,29,30,31.\nAdditionally, the precise locations of the affected clouds can be hard to\npredict and are sometimes inaccessible for ground-based observers. Earth\nobservation satellites in geostationary orbit can continuously monitor clouds\nin large geographical areas^32,33,34 and hints of dissipating cumulus clouds\nhave been observed by comparing satellite images before and after a total\nsolar eclipse, without estimating the non-eclipse state^26,35. However, during\nsolar eclipses, satellite images show spatio-temporally varying\ndarkening^35,36 and satellite retrievals of cloud cover and cloud optical\nthickness (COT) are biased. This bias is caused by not taking into account the\ninsolation reduction in the calculation of the top-of-atmosphere (TOA)\nreflectance from which cloud properties are derived. Hence, it has remained\nunknown how fast clouds are modified by various solar obscuration fractions.\n\nHere, we present geostationary satellite measurements of clouds during three\nsolar eclipses between 2005 and 2016 that have been corrected for the\ninsolation reduction. Our corrected measurements reveal that shallow cumulus\nclouds start to dissipate at a solar obscuration of ~15% over cooling land\nsurfaces, which would have been hidden in the partial lunar shadow without\ninsolation reduction correction. Using large-eddy simulations we explain the\ntiming of the cloud dissipation and demonstrate that the rising air parcels in\nthe atmospheric boundary layer are already affected by the solar eclipse at\neven smaller obscurations. We calculate that neglecting the dissipating cloud\nbehavior in the simulations would result in an overestimation of 20 W m^\u22122 of\nthe eclipse-related reduction of net incoming shortwave radiation at TOA.\nFinally, we discuss that the high cloud sensitivity to rather small insolation\nreductions should spur cloud model simulations of the short-term impact of\nsunlight-intercepting geoengineering concepts.\n\n## Results\n\n### Satellite observations\n\nFigure 1 shows the uncorrected and corrected TOA visible (VIS) reflectance\nover East Africa and part of the Indian Ocean, at four subsequent hours during\nthe annular solar eclipse on 3 October 2005, obtained by the Spinning Enhanced\nVisible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) instrument (see Methods). In the first\nhour, cumulus clouds were present over land. They are better visible in the\ncorrected high resolution images of the COT zoomed in on the specific area\nover land at 3^\u2218\u20137^\u2218 latitude and 27^\u2218\u201331^\u2218 longitude (Fig. 1c), which we call\nthe study area. The derived COT in the cloudy pixels was \u22725 and SEVIRI\nestimated a cloud top altitude of ~2 km (see Supplementary Fig. 1), indicating\nthat they were shallow and located in the planetary boundary layer. Similar\nlarge-scale daytime shallow cumulus cloud fields over land can be found in\ncentral Africa and the Amazonian rainforest throughout the year, and in\nnortheast America and Siberia during the boreal summer^37,38. When the\nobscuration increased in the second hour, the cloud cover in the study area\ndiminished, although remnants of the cloud pattern of the previous hour are\nstill recognizable. In the third hour, the insolation increased again, but the\nshallow cumulus clouds stayed away while the clouds that survived had grown in\nsize and COT. It was only during the final stage of the eclipse that shallow\ncumulus clouds returned throughout the study area. Over ocean, the cumulus\nclouds did not disappear. In Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3, we provide two more\nexamples of vanishing shallow cumulus clouds over land during solar eclipses.\n\nFig. 1: SEVIRI images of the annular solar eclipse on 3 October 2005.\n\na The original and b the eclipse corrected TOA VIS reflectance over East\nAfrica (in the West) and Indian Ocean (in the East), at 09:37, 10:37, 11:37\nand 12:37 UTC (from top to bottom). The colored contour lines indicate the\nsolar obscuration fraction and the white squares over land mark the study\narea. c The corresponding eclipse corrected cloud optical thickness zoomed-in\non the study area.\n\nFull size image\n\nThe disappearance of shallow cumulus clouds only occurred on the day of the\nsolar eclipse. Figure 2a shows the time series of the cloud cover in the study\narea, compared to that during 11 comparable days which we selected based on a\nsimilar type of cloud pattern before the eclipse started (see Methods). Also\ndepicted in Fig. 2 is the obscuration fraction on the eclipse day. The time\nseries shows that the increasing cloud cover in the morning already halted at\nlow obscuration fractions (~0.15), happening at around 09:30 UTC which was 30\nminutes after the start of the eclipse. Secondly, there was a ~50 min time lag\nwith respect to the instant of maximum obscuration at 10:52 UTC before the\nclouds started to return. During the increase in cloud cover between 12:00 and\n12:30 UTC, the mean COT in the cloudy pixels decreased (see Fig. 2b), which\ncan be attributed to the contribution of the newly formed shallow clouds. This\ndecrease is absent in the time series of the comparable days.\n\nFig. 2: Time series of cloud and land surface parameters in the study area\n(i.e., the white square in Fig. 1).\n\na The retrieved cloud cover by SEVIRI. b The cloud optical thickness (COT)\nretrieved by SEVIRI. c The spatial mean land surface temperature (LST)\nretrieved by SEVIRI. d The modeled cloud cover with DALES. e The COT simulated\nwith DALES. f The sensible and latent heat fluxes modeled with DALES. The\nblack solid lines are for the day of the solar eclipse (3 October 2005). The\ngray dashed lines in a\u2013c are for the comparable days but without solar\neclipse. The black dashed lines in d\u2013f are the results of the modeled\nreference case. The blue solid lines illustrate the spatial average\nobscuration fraction, with error bars in a\u2013c representing the standard\ndeviation of the spatial variation. The blue vertical dotted lines indicate\nthe start, maximum, and end of the eclipse (from left to right). The missing\nobservations between 9 and 10 UTC in b are caused by COT retrieval errors at\nthat scattering geometry due to the cloud bow. The insets show the time series\nzoomed in on 09:00 to 10:00 UTC. Local noon occurred at 10:04 UTC.\n\nFull size image\n\nBecause shallow cumulus clouds in the boundary layer are generated by rising\nthermals originating from air close to the surface^39, we collected land\nsurface temperature (LST) measurements from space by SEVIRI, derived from\ninfrared radiation emitted by the shallow land surface layer (see Methods).\nFigure 2c shows the spatially averaged LST in the study area on the eclipse\nday and the comparable days. The maximum LST on the comparable days was two\nhours delayed with respect to local noon at 10:04 UTC, which could possibly be\nexplained by the smaller heat flux into the ground due to the warmed\nsubsurface layer in the afternoon^40. On the eclipse day, the LST drops\ninstantly with the obscuration fraction, due to the direct response of the\nshallow land surface layer temperature to net radiation forcing^40. We\nestimate a maximum LST drop of 5.8 K induced by the eclipse at 11.00 UTC (see\nMethods). Comparable fast drops in satellite LST measurements have been found\nin a study over Europe during the total solar eclipse of 20 March 2015 by ref.\n^41 who showed dependencies of the drop magnitude on the eclipse duration and\ntime of the day (earlier eclipses gave larger drops), vegetation, surface\nheight and distance to the coast. We did not detect a time lag in the LST\nminimum with respect to maximum solar obscuration: a time lag of ~1.5 min as\nreported in literature^41 is not resolved in our LST data at 15 minutes\nintervals. Hence, the measured time lag of ~50 min before clouds return in\nFig. 2a cannot be explained by a time lag in the LST. Over ocean, we found no\nsea surface temperature drop when the eclipse passed (see Supplementary Fig.\n4), due to the large heat capacity of water and the efficient heat transport\nfrom the sea surface to deeper water layers through turbulent mixing^40.\n\n### Large-eddy simulations\n\nIn order to explain the land-cloud interaction in the study area, we simulated\nthe evolution of shallow cumulus clouds during a solar eclipse with the Dutch\nAtmospheric Large-Eddy Simulation (DALES) model^42. Figures 2d and e show the\ntime series of the simulated cloud cover and mean COT, respectively, as would\nbe measured from space (see Methods), and Supplementary Fig. 5 contains\nsnapshots of the spatially resolved cloud fields. We present the results for\nthe solar eclipse case, using the measured LST as input, and a reference case\nwithout eclipse-induced LST drop (see Methods). Indeed, in the solar eclipse\ncase, our simulations show a substantial decrease in cloud cover with respect\nto the reference case. The cloud cover already differed ~15 to ~20 min after\nthe start of the eclipse when the obscuration was still smaller than 10%. As\nin the observations (Fig. 2a), there is a time lag in the instant of minimum\ncloud cover with respect to mid-eclipse, after which the cloud cover rapidly\nincreases. We note that the simulated cloud cover right after the eclipse is\neven larger than in the reference case, while the simulated COT is lower. A\nlarger cloud cover after the eclipse compared to the hypothetical non-eclipse\nscenario is difficult to prove with our observations, due to the large\nvariability of the cloud cover on the comparable days in the afternoon (cf.\nFig. 2a). During the rapid increase in cloud cover, the simulated COT also\nincreases, which is not in agreement with the observations, but can be\nattributed to the absence of the deeper convective clouds in the south part of\nthe study area due to the horizontally averaged input settings in our\nsimulations (see Methods).\n\nThe disappearing clouds during a solar eclipse can be explained by the drop in\nsensible (thermal) and latent (moisture) heat fluxes from the surface to the\nlowest atmosphere layer (Fig. 2f), as a result of the dropping LST (see Eqs.\n(1) and (2)). Those heat fluxes drive the buoyancy flux (Fig. 3b, f) of\nrelatively warm and moist air parcels from the surface, through the well-mixed\nboundary layer, up to the level of minimum buoyancy flux (LMBF) where the\nparcels are capped by a temperature inversion (see Supplementary Fig. 6). The\nrising parcels are cooled through adiabatic expansion which increases the\nparcel relatively humidity (RH) up to 100% at the lifting condensation level\n(LCL) where shallow cumulus clouds are formed that can extend to higher\naltitudes (Fig. 3a, e). During a solar eclipse, this process is suppressed,\nwhich is clear from the overall drop in buoyancy flux. The drop in surface and\nbuoyancy fluxes is consistent with the diminished boundary layer turbulence\nduring solar eclipses found in other studies^31,43,44. It should be noted that\nthe LMBF is still higher in our model than the LCL, but with smaller upward\nparcel velocities (Fig. 3c) which are controlled by the surface buoyancy flux,\nfewer parcels reach the LCL.\n\nFig. 3: Large-eddy simulation results from DALES for the solar eclipse and\nreference case.\n\na Time-varying vertical profiles of the horizontal mean liquid water specific\nhumidity q_l and b the buoyancy flux \\\\(\\overline{{w}^{{\\prime} }{\\theta\n}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{v}}}}}}}}}^{{\\prime} }}\\\\) for the solar eclipse case. c The\nvertical updraft velocity w_3% of the 3-percentile fastest rising parcels at\nvarious altitudes and d the travel time \u0394t of the 1- to 5-percentile fastest\nrising parcels from the surface to lifting condensation level (LCL) and to the\ncloud top (indicated with brown and gray color shades, respectively), for the\nsolar eclipse case. Similar for Figs. e\u2013h, but then for the reference case. In\nFigs. a, b, e and f, the LCL and level of minimum buoyancy flux (LMBF) are\nindicated with a dashed and dotted line, respectively.\n\nFull size image\n\nThe ~15\u201320 min delay of the simulated vanishing cloud cover with respect to\nthe dropping LST can be related to the ~16\u201324 min travel time around 09:00 UTC\nof the fastest rising parcels from the lowest atmospheric layer to the cloud\ntop as shown in Fig. 3d, after which the first individual clouds could fully\ndisappear. We note that the vertical updraft velocity of the lowest layer\nresponded within 5 min to differences in surface fluxes. The travel time\ndepends on the cloud top height and vertical updraft velocities (see Fig. 3c,\ng and Methods). Thus, the cloud response was initiated when the parcels\naffected by the eclipse started rising, at even smaller obscuration fractions\nthan at which this response could be observed. The ~18 min time lag of the\nsimulated cloud cover minimum with respect to mid-eclipse can be related to\nthe relatively long travel time around 11:10 UTC of ~13\u201319 min to LCL at which\nthe newly formed clouds started influencing the cloud cover. Furthermore, we\nnote that the LCL and cloud base remained slightly lower after the eclipse\ncompared to the reference case, due to the continued colder air near the\nsurface (see Supplementary Fig. 7 and Eq. (4)). In Fig. 4 we provide a\nconceptual model in which we summarize the most important processes\nresponsible for the shallow cumulus cloud behavior during a solar eclipse.\n\nFig. 4: Conceptual model of shallow cumulus cloud evolution during a solar\neclipse.\n\nThe time progresses in the horizontal direction to the right. Background color\nshading indicates the virtual potential temperature of the atmosphere and land\nsurface in our simulation. The red and blue arrows are the sensible and latent\nheat fluxes, respectively, which depend strongly on the temperature difference\nbetween the surface and the atmosphere just above the surface. The yellow\narrows represent the amount of incoming solar radiation, which is largest\naround noon but is reduced during a solar eclipse as illustrated by the lunar\ndisk covering the solar disk. When the growing atmospheric boundary layer\nheight (dotted line) intersects with the lifting condensation level (dashed\nline), clouds are formed, but they are diminished when the updrafts are slowed\ndown during a solar eclipse, as indicated by the smaller inclination of the\nblack arrow.\n\nFull size image\n\nThe disappearance of the shallow cumuli during the solar eclipse has a notable\nfeedback on the solar radiative fluxes. This can be understood from Fig. 5,\nwhich shows the simulated reflected and net incoming shortwave (SW) radiative\nflux at TOA, for both the reference and solar eclipse cases. As a result of\nthe solar eclipse the net incoming SW flux started to decrease at 09:00 UTC.\nHowever, this change, which has solar dimming as its main cause, is also\naffected by the decrease of SW radiation reflected back into space due to the\nclearance of the sky. Indeed, the latter indirect effect causes an opposing\nincrease in the net incoming SW flux at TOA. Neglecting the solar eclipse-\ninduced cloud disappearance in our simulations (as illustrated by dotted line\nin Fig. 5), resulted in an overestimation of 20 W m^\u22122 of the eclipse-related\nreduction of net incoming SW flux at TOA at 11:22 UTC. We note that this error\nwould further increase with longer time lags of the cloud return with respect\nto mid-eclipse, such as found in the satellite observations (Fig. 2a), because\nthen more sunlight illuminates the cloud-free scenes.\n\nFig. 5: Simulated radiative fluxes at the top-of-atmosphere (TOA).\n\na The reflected and b the net incoming shortwave (SW) radiation (note the\ndifferent scales of the vertical axes). The solid line is for the solar\neclipse case, the dashed line is for the reference case, and the dotted line\nis for reference case multiplied by (1 \u2212 f_o), with f_o the solar obscuration\nfraction. The bottom panels show the deviation of the latter from the solar\neclipse case.\n\nFull size image\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe observed response of shallow cumulus clouds to a solar eclipse at already\n~15% obscuration, initiated at even smaller obscurations due to the parcel\ntravel time, reveals the potential direct consequence of deploying sunlight\nintercepting material in the stratosphere or in space. We note that the\nduration of the cloud response is expected to depend on the speed and\nmagnitude of the local obscuration variations, as the altered difference\nbetween the near-surface air and surface temperature, which causes the\nresponse, may possibly restore after a certain period. Diminished shallow\ncumulus clouds would partly oppose the objective of solar geoengineering which\nis to decrease the amount of net incoming solar radiation, and could prevent\nthe growth into deeper convective and possibly precipitating clouds^45. While\nsolar geoengineering proposals aim to reduce the solar radiation reaching the\n(lower) atmosphere and surface globally by only a few percent (depending on\nthe required compensation), the use of non-uniform reductions to achieve this\ngoal could increase the locally experienced variations in obscuration^10.\nSpace-based examples are the deployment of solar reflectors in Earth orbit^8,9\nor in orbit around the 1st Lagrange point^10, offering daily and seasonally\nvarying shading, respectively. Injected stratospheric aerosols can also\nexhibit spatio-temporally varying patterns due to seasonally changing global\nstratospheric circulation, depending on the injection location^46 and strategy\nemployed (whether constant or step-wise)^47,48. Consequently, aerosol optical\ndepths of 0.4\u20130.6 could be attained locally^46,47,48, causing up to ~45% of\nthe local direct sunlight to be scattered or absorbed by the aerosols before\nit reaches the lower atmosphere. Our results should spur model simulations\ninvestigating the response of shallow cumulus clouds to those geoengineering\nconcepts, particularly for scenes over land where the surface temperature can\nadjust quickly. Additionally, our measurements provide an opportunity to\nvalidate these models, enhancing their reliability in predicting cloud\nbehavior under natural conditions and in a world influenced by solar\ngeoengineering.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Cloud measurements\n\nThe primary data set used in this research consists of measurements from the\nSpinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) on board the Meteosat\nSecond Generation (MSG) series of geostationary satellites operated by\nEUMETSAT. We used data from Meteosat-8 and Meteosat-10, for the 2005\u20132006 and\n2016 cases, respectively. SEVIRI measures TOA radiances over the full Earth\ndisk centered at 0^\u2218 latitude and 0^\u2218 longitude every 15 minutes in twelve\nchannels across the visible and near-infrared part of the spectrum^49. Eleven\nchannels have a narrow bandwidth at low spatial resolution (3 \u00d7 3 km^2 at sub-\nsatellite point) and one channel has a broad bandwidth (0.6\u20130.9 \u03bcm) at high\nspatial resolution (1 \u00d7 1 km^2), the latter being referred to as the HRV\nchannel. Shortwave channel reflectances were obtained from the observed\nradiances and the calculated solar irradiance, and were calibrated with MODIS\nfollowing ref. ^50. For the longwave channels, the operational calibration\nfrom EUMETSAT was used.\n\nFor the surface temperature analyses at low spatial resolution (see Surface\ntemperature measurements), cloud masks were calculated using the EUMETSAT\nNowcasting and Very Short Range Forecasting Satellite Application Facility\n(NWC SAF) v2021 cloud algorithm^51. The NWC SAF software also provided the\ncloud top height at low spatial resolution. For the cloud analyses at high\nspatial resolution, we used the low-resolution NWC SAF cloud mask as a basis\nand improved the spatial resolution of the cloud mask using the HRV TOA\nreflectances by comparing with a HRV TOA reflectance climatology, which was\ngenerated for each pixel with HRV TOA reflectance measurements in a 16-day\nperiod centered at the day of the eclipse, following the method of ref. ^52.\nThe TOA reflectances of the 0.6 and 1.6 \u03bcm channels were paired to\nsimultaneously retrieve the COT and effective droplet radius^34,53, which were\ndownscaled to high spatial resolution using the HRV channel as described in\nmore detail in refs. ^54,55. The COT of the pixels that were not masked as\ncloudy was set equal to zero. For the study area (3\u20137^\u2218 N latitude, 27\u201331^\u2218 E\nlongitude on 3 October 2005) and between 06:00 and 09:00 UTC, pixels with a\nTOA reflectance value larger than 1.0, originating from the sunglint in the\nrivers, were removed from the cloud product.\n\n### Solar eclipse correction\n\nWe corrected the TOA reflectance for its reduction during a solar eclipse,\nthat was due to the ignorance of the reduced solar irradiance in its\ncalculation, through a division by 1 \u2212 f_o, with f_o the solar obscuration\nfraction. In previous work^56, we validated this approach with the TROPOMI\nsatellite instrument, which allowed for accurate monitoring of aerosols in the\npartial lunar shadow up to f_o = 0.92. Recently, Wen et al.^57 applied a\nsimilar type of correction to images of the Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera\n(EPIC) instrument on the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR), to quantify\nthe measured TOA reflectance error without eclipse correction of the sunlit\nside of the Earth during the annular solar eclipse on 21 June 2020. The value\nof f_o is different for every pixel as it depends on measurement time, surface\nheight, latitude and longitude, which are provided with the SEVIRI data. The\nso-called Besselian elements describing the temporal variation of the Moon\nshadow\u2019s geometry were taken from ref. ^58. The value of f_o also depends on\nwavelength through the wavelength dependent limb darkening of the solar\ndisk^59. For the corrections of the TOA reflectances in the HRV channel and\n0.6 \u03bcm, 0.8 \u03bcm and 1.6 \u03bcm channels, we used the limb darkening coefficients of\nPierce et al.^60 and Pierce et al.^61 at 0.7 \u03bcm and the central wavelengths\n0.635 \u03bcm, 0.81 \u03bcm and 1.64 \u03bcm, respectively. We refer to Trees et al.^56 for\nmore details about the solar eclipse correction of the TOA reflectance.\nApplying the cloud algorithms to the corrected TOA reflectance yielded the\ncorrected cloud mask and COT.\n\n### Surface temperature measurements\n\nFor the measurements of land surface temperature (LST), we used the LST\nproduct of the Land Surface Analysis Satellite Application Facility (LSA\nSAF)^62 derived from the 10.8 \u03bcm and 12 \u03bcm SEVIRI channels^63 with an\nuncertainty of 1 to 2 K^64 which is expected to be stable within the time\nscales of solar eclipses^41. We computed the horizontal average LST in the\nstudy area in every 15 minutes time step, after replacing the cloudy pixels by\ninterpolated nearest neighbor values using the corrected SEVIRI NWC SAF cloud\nmask (see Cloud algorithm and Solar eclipse correction). The maximum LST drop\ndue to the eclipse was estimated with respect to the average LST of comparable\ndays (see Selection of comparable days). For the measurements of the sea\nsurface temperature (SST), we used the hourly SST product of the Ocean and Sea\nIce Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF)^65 derived from the 10.8 \u03bcm and\n12 \u03bcm SEVIRI channels with an uncertainty well below 1 K^66.\n\n### Selection of comparable days\n\nThe selection of days without solar eclipse that are comparable to our study\ncase on 3 October 2005 in East Africa was done by first selecting 100 days\nfrom September and October in 2004, 2005 and 2006 with the smallest\ndifferences with respect to our study case in the sums of the predicted\nsensible and latent heat fluxes by ERA5^67 (which does not take into account\nthe solar eclipse effect) in the complete diurnal cycle. Subsequently, we\nrefined the selection by removing the days for which the mean of the absolute\ndifferences in high spatial resolution cloud cover with respect to our study\ncase between 06:00 and 09:00 UTC was larger than the threshold of 0.1. In this\nway, we obtained 11 days for which we find the cloud cover comparable in the\nmorning before the lunar shadow reached the study area: 2004-09-10,\n2004-10-24, 2005-09-03, 2005-09-19, 2005-09-25, 2005-09-29, 2005-10-04,\n2006-09-01, 2006-09-04, 2006-09-08, 2006-10-06. We visually inspected the HRV\nTOA reflectance and COT for those comparable days and indeed found between\n06:00 and 09:00 UTC similar types of shallow cumulus clouds throughout the\nscene, with low COTs (\u22725) as shown in Fig. 2b.\n\n### Cloud simulations\n\nThe cloud simulations were performed with the Dutch Atmospheric Large-Eddy\nSimulation (DALES) model^42. The setup was a horizontally cyclic domain of 50\nby 50 km^2 with horizontal cell sizes of 100 by 100 m^2 and 209 vertical\nlayers between 0 and 14 km altitude. The vertical extent of each layer was\nstretched by a factor 1.01 with respect to the layer just below, and it was 20\nm in the lowest layer. The ground surface was assumed flat. The atmosphere\nvariables in the domain were initialized with horizontally homogeneous\nvertical profiles of the liquid potential temperature, total water specific\nhumidity, and horizontal wind speed and direction. Those profiles were the\nhorizontal mean profiles at 02:00 UTC in the study area (3^\u2218-7^\u2218N latitude,\n27^\u2218-31^\u2218E longitude on 3 October 2005), taken from ERA5^67. The pressure\nprofile was determined with the use of the thermodynamic profiles, the gas law\nand mean hydrostatic balance. After 02:00 UTC, the simulation freely\npropagated those variables, until 15:00 UTC when the simulations ended. The\ntime and altitude dependent mean horizontal advective tendencies of heat and\nmoisture, in addition to the geostrophic winds, were all diagnosed from ERA5\nand prescribed in the DALES runs. That is, we neglect the horizontal in- and\noutflow of eclipse-induced atmospheric changes at the boundaries of the\ndomain, e.g. due to short-term disturbances in the horizontal pressure\ngradient^68. At the top boundary during the simulation, we imposed large-scale\nsubsidence, also taken from ERA5.\n\nThe surface fluxes of heat and moisture were computed according to the\nvertical difference of potential temperature \u03b8 and the water vapor specific\nhumidity q_v between the ground surface and the lowest atmospheric model layer\n(indicated by the subscript \u2018bot\u2019), respectively. With the appropriate\nconversion of potential temperature to temperature the sensible and latent\nfluxes can be expressed as\n\n$${F}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{SH}}}}}}}}}=\\frac{\\rho\n{c}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{p}}}}}}}}}}{{r}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{a,T}}}}}}}}}}\\left({T}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{sfc}}}}}}}}}-{T}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{bot}}}}}}}}}-\\frac{g{z}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{bot}}}}}}}}}}{{c}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{p}}}}}}}}}}\\right)$$\n\n(1)\n\n$${F}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{LH}}}}}}}}}=\\frac{\\rho\n{L}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{v}}}}}}}}}}{{r}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{a,q}}}}}}}}}}\\left({q}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{sat}}}}}}}}}({T}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{sfc}}}}}}}}})-{q}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{v,bot}}}}}}}}}\\right)$$\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c1 is the air density in kg m^\u22123, c_p = 1004 J kg^\u22121 K^\u22121 the heat\ncapacity of dry air, g = 9.81 m s^\u22122 the gravitational acceleration, L_v = 2.5\n\u22c5 10^6 J kg^\u22121 the latent heat for vaporization of water, and q_sat the\ntemperature dependent saturation specific humidity. The aerodynamic resistance\ncoefficients for heat and moisture, r_a,T and r_a,q, respectively, depend on\nthe atmospheric stability near the surface following Monin-Obukhov similarity\ntheory^42. The dependencies of the r_a values on the surface roughness length\nand the actual soil water content, which for land conditions will typically be\nmuch lower than the saturated value q_sat, were taken into account by\nmultiplying them with constant correction factors. This calibration step was\nmade to obtain sensible and heat fluxes that were consistent with the ECMWF\nmodel for the reference case. As a consequence, the surface heat fluxes were\nnot parameterized as functions of net incoming radiation, to avoid unnecessary\ncomplexity and uncertainties. Instead, the surface temperature T_sfc was\nprescribed using the SEVIRI LST measurements in the study area (see Satellite\nmeasurements), and shifted to the ERA5 skin temperature at 02:00 UTC through a\npositive offset of 2.0274 K applied to the complete LST time series, for\nconsistency with the initial atmospheric profiles. In the simulation without\neclipse and until 09:00 UTC, T_sfc was identical to that in the simulation\nwith eclipse, but after 09:00 UTC it was the average of the LST time series of\nthe comparable days shifted to the ERA5 skin temperature at 02:00 UTC.\n\nThe simulated cloud cover in the study area was computed as follows. First, we\nregridded the DALES output liquid water specific humidity q_l in kg kg^\u22121 to a\ngrid with cell sizes of 1 \u00d7 1 km^2, for a fair comparison with the SEVIRI\nobservations. Secondly, we computed the COT by evaluating the following\nintegral from the surface (0) to TOA (z_TOA)^69:\n\n$${{{{{{{\\rm{COT}}}}}}}}(x,y)=\\int\\nolimits_{0}^{{z}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{TOA}}}}}}}}}}\\frac{\\frac{3}{2}{\\rho\n}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{air}}}}}}}}}(z){q}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{l}}}}}}}}}(x,y,z)}{{\\rho\n}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{liq}}}}}}}}}{r}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{eff}}}}}}}}}}dz$$\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03c1_air is the air density in kg m^\u22123, \u03c1_liq = 1000 kg m^\u22123 is the density\nof liquid water, and r_eff is the droplet effective radius which we assumed to\nbe constant and equal to 10^\u22125 m. Thirdly, the columns (x, y) with a COT\nlarger than 1 were flagged as a cloudy column. The cloud cover was computed as\nthe number of cloudy columns divided by the total number of columns in the\ndomain. For the mean COT time series, we computed the horizontal average COT\nconsidering the cloudy columns only.\n\nThe lifting condensation level (LCL) in m was computed from the DALES output\nof air temperature T_bot in K and relative humidity RH_bot in % of the bottom\natmospheric layer (at 10 meter altitude), using the suggested formula by^70:\n\n$${z}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{LCL}}}}}}}}}=\\left(20+\\frac{{T}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{bot}}}}}}}}}-273.15}{5}\\right)\\cdot\n(100-{{{\\mbox{RH}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{bot}}}}}}}}})$$\n\n(4)\n\nThe level of minimum buoyancy flux (LMBF) was computed as the altitude at\nwhich the buoyancy flux \\\\(\\overline{{w}^{{\\prime} }{\\theta }_{v}^{{\\prime}\n}}\\\\) was minimum, where \u03b8_v is the virtual potential temperature which\ndepends on specific humidity q_v in kg kg^\u22121, temperature T in K, pressure p\nin Pa, reference pressure p_0 = 10^5 Pa, c_p, the gas constant for dry air R_d\n= 287.0 J kg^\u22121 K^\u22121, and the gas constant for water vapor R_v = 461.5 J kg^\u22121\nK^\u22121^71:\n\n$${\\theta\n}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{v}}}}}}}}}=T{\\left(\\frac{{p}_{0}}{p}\\right)}^{\\frac{{R}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{d}}}}}}}}}}{{c}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{p}}}}}}}}}}}\\left(1+\\left(\\frac{{R}_{v}}{{R}_{d}}-1\\right)\\cdot\n{q}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{v}}}}}}}}}\\right)$$\n\n(5)\n\nand \\\\(\\overline{{w}^{{\\prime} }{\\theta }_{{{{{{{{\\rm{v}}}}}}}}}^{{\\prime}\n}}\\\\) was defined as:\n\n$$\\overline{{w}^{{\\prime} }{\\theta }_{{{{{{{{\\rm{v}}}}}}}}}^{{\\prime}\n}}=\\frac{\\mathop{\\sum }\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{{N}_{x}}\\mathop{\\sum }\\nolimits_{j =\n1}^{{N}_{y}}{w}_{ij}({\\theta }_{{{{{{{{\\rm{v,}}}}}}}}ij}-{\\overline{\\theta\n}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{v}}}}}}}}})}{{N}_{x}{N}_{y}}$$\n\n(6)\n\nin which N_x and N_y are the number of grid cells in the horizontal x- and y\ndirections, and the overbar indicates a horizontal mean value. The mean\nupdraft virtual potential temperature, \\\\({\\overline{\\theta\n}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{v,up}}}}}}}}}(z)\\\\), was computed as the mean of \u03b8_v(z) of the\nupdrafts only (i.e., the grid points at a certain altitude z for which w_ij >\n0). The velocities of the fast rising parcels were defined by the p-percentile\nvelocities w_p% (with p = 1, 3 and 5), which were the vertical velocities at a\ncertain altitude z for which a percentage p of the w-distribution contained\ngrid points with w_ij > w_p% (see ref. ^72). The travel time \u0394t of the fast\nrising parcels from the surface to a certain altitude z_*, using vertical\nvelocity w_p%, was computed by numerically evaluating\n\n$$\\Delta t=\\int\\nolimits_{0}^{{z}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{*\n}}}}}}}}}}\\frac{dz}{{w}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{p}}}}}}}} \\% }(z)}$$\n\n(7)\n\nwith z_* = z_LCL for the travel time to LCL and z_* = z_CT for the travel time\nto the cloud top. The cloud top was defined as the highest altitude for which\nq_l > 0.\n\nDALES uses the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model for Global climate model\napplications (RRTMG) radiation scheme^73,74 to compute the shortwave (SW) and\nlongwave (LW) radiative fluxes through the atmosphere, emitted and reflected\nby the surface, and emerging from TOA during the simulation. In the solar\neclipse case, the SW radiation incident at TOA was multiplied by (1 \u2212 f_o),\nwhere f_o was the horizontal mean obscuration fraction in the study area taken\nat 0.635 \u03bcm (see Solar eclipse correction). We used vertical profiles of the\nozone mass mixing ratios in the study area from ERA5^67. The surface albedo\nwas the horizontal mean white-sky albedo in the study area measured by\nMODIS^75.\n\n### Reporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio\nReporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n## Data availability\n\nThe data required to replicate the timeseries presented in this article, as\nwell as the input and boundary conditions for our model simulations, are\navailable in the public repository Zenodo\n(https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10371414).\n\n## Code availability\n\nThe Dutch Atmospheric Large-Eddy Simulation (DALES) software used for this\nresearch is publicly available under the terms of the GNU GPL version 3 on\nhttps://github.com/dalesteam/dales.\n\n## References\n\n  1.
