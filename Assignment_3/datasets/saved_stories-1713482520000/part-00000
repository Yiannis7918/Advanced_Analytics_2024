In 1994, I had started one of the very first Web-based businesses, a\nsite focused on real estate and mortgage finance, as a solo entrepreneur. I\nfolded it into a partnership with a relocation firm more than a year later,\nand we unloaded it onto one of the public Dotcom companies in 1999, which was\na good time to sell a Web business.\n\nThe experience was intense. In those days, we talked about dog-years, where\none year of being in business on the Net was like several years of being in\nbusiness in the pre-Web days. So for me writing the book was to some degree\ntherapeutic, a chance to pause and reflect back.\n\nThe book that I intended to write was my analysis of the significance of the\nInternet, both commercially and in general. But that is not what I ended up\nwriting.\n\nMy thinking was that if I wanted people to read the book, I needed to get a\npublisher behind it. In order to get a publisher behind it, I believed I\nneeded an agent. I contacted one of the authors of The Cluetrain Manifesto, a\nsuccessful book about the Internet, and asked for suggestions about an agent.\nI took the suggestion.\n\nI wound up writing the book that the agent succeeded in pitching instead of\nthe book I wanted to write. It was a book that described my own experience\n(that is probably the best part) and also had short \u201ccase studies\u201d of a couple\ndozen other entrepreneurs, most of whom were just getting started.\n\nI advise against writing a book based on what an agent is able to pitch. Years\nfrom now, the only people who might care about your book are your\ngrandchildren. You want them to read your book, not your agent\u2019s book.\n\nI expected that the publisher would work on publicizing my book. That was\nwrong. Publicizing your book is your responsibility. In fact, publishers\nnowadays care about your ability to self-promote (how many Twitter followers\ndo you have?) at least as much as they care about your manuscript.\n\nNot satisfied with that experience, I self-published my next book. Titled\nLearning Economics, it was a collection of essays that I had written on the\nWeb, mostly for a site called TechCentralStation (TCS). There was no conflict\nwith an agent over the content of the book. But there was no publicity for the\nbook. So that was not particularly satisfying, either.\n\nHealth care policy was a major issue in the early 2000s, and I wrote several\nessays on that topic for TCS. Cato\u2019s Brink Lindsey and Michael Cannon\ncommissioned me to write a book, which became Crisis of Abundance. I don\u2019t\nknow how well it did, but I am very proud of it. I said in 2006 when it was\npublished that I thought that the analysis would hold up for ten years,\nregardless of how health care policy might change in the meantime. In fact, as\nof 2024 I still think that the analysis holds up. I don\u2019t think you will find\na better book on health care policy written before or since.\n\nAnother book that made me proud was my next effort, written with TCS editor\nNick Schulz. We championed an approach to economics that emphasized intangible\nfactors, as opposed to the materialist focus of mainstream econ. I contributed\nchapters that were essays on various topics, and Nick contributed chapters\nthat were interviews with famous economists, such as Paul Romer and Robert\nFogel.\n\nFor publication, we went with a conservative publisher, Encounter Books. We\nstruggled to come up with a title for the book. The first edition was called\nFrom Poverty to Prosperity, which captured some aspects of the book but failed\nto convey the main theme. When the paperback version came out, it was retitled\nInvisible Wealth, which better described the theme of intangible economic\nfactors.\n\nWhatever you title that book, its lessons are timeless. That is fortunate,\nbecause the process of getting it into print was delayed.\n\nMeanwhile, I had written another book, this one solicited by Peter Berkowitz\nof the Hoover Institution. Titled Unchecked and Unbalanced, it is my most\nlibertarian book. But while it was being written in 2008, the Great Financial\nCrisis occurred, and Peter convinced me to tie that event to the main theme of\nthe book, which was that in the United States power has become too\ncentralized.\n\nThe result is a mixture of some timeless thoughts and a discussion of then-\ncurrent events. I think that each detracts from the other. When I refer to the\nbook, I always call it \u201cwidely unread.\u201d One consolation is that George Gilder\nread it and credited in his book Knowledge and Power, because one of my main\nthemes was what I called the knowledge-power discrepancy, with policy makers\nin Washington having too much power relative to their knowledge.\n\nSpeaking of the financial crisis, Mercatus published my lengthy analysis\ncalled Not What They Had in Mind. You might think of it as a book, although it\nis shorter than that.\n\nIn 2013, not long after Amazon introduced self-publishing for the Kindle, I\ncame out with The Three Languages of Politics. This was to become my most\nwell-known work. Cato\u2019s Aaron Ross Powell offered to publish a new and\nexpanded edition in their Libertarianism.org imprint. I have not tracked total\nsales, and I took a fixed $5000 payment with no royalties, but that book has\nbeen a pretty decent word-of-mouth success.\n\nI am also very proud of another book that Cato published, called\nSpecialization and Trade. I think of it as economics as it should be\npresented, as opposed to mainstream economics today. You owe it to yourself to\nread it. You can download it for free. Of course, reading it will cost your\ntime.\n\nI wish that this book were better appreciated. The late Herb Gintis put up a\nnasty review on Amazon, which I am sure inhibited sales. He was a creative\neconomic thinker, but way over on the left, and he hated the book for that\nreason.\n\nI think that most of my books are under-promoted. As disappointed as I am with\npublishers, I have to put most of the blame on myself. I just seem unable to\nfocus on self-promotion. If you write, and you want to be read, do as I say\nand not as I do. That is, play the promotion game really well.\n\nShare\n\n32 Likes\n\n32\n\nShare this post\n\n#### My Books, Essay #1\n\narnoldkling.substack.com\n\n10\n\nShare\n\n10 Comments\n\nFazeApr 17Arnold should not beat himself up over not publicizing his own work.\nHe has done a fine job through his ASK and this Substack. After all, I'm a\nrandom non-economist in the midwest, and somehow, some years ago, I stumbled\non his writings and was won over to his way of thinking. Now I'm a fan, and\ninterested to know his views on any topic whatsoever, knowing that, whether I\nagree with them or not, they will have been well thought out and clearly\nexpressed. Alas, the very qualities that make Arnold worth reading are the\nvery qualities that militate against his becoming a media sensation.(For my\npart, I was fortunate enough to have a successful book in the early 90s. Sales\nwere driven entirely by rave reviews in major media outlets nationwide. When\nthe publisher finally got around to buying ads in the NYT, Washington Post,\netc., the sales curve was well past its peak and the ads accomplished little.\nI co-wrote another book, and my co-author got 83 rejections before it won a\nprize and was picked up by a major publisher and sold well. His persistence\ntaught me the validity of the \"ten times more\" rule. If I were to publish\ntoday, I'd work ten times more than other authors to get copies before\nreviewers' eyes - print, social media, and whatever else is out there.)Expand\nfull commentLike (4)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nThucydidesApr 17I particularly loved the Specialization and Trade book, as it\nprovided a compelling alternative interpretive framework for understanding the\neconomy in place of tired and obviously deficient old Keynesian \"GDP factory\"\nmodel. The S&T book corresponds to the reality of human interactions; the GDP\nfactory model was an attempt to entirely mathematize them, with dismal\nresults.Expand full commentLike (4)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n8 more comments...\n\nThe Strategy of Dating Short Men\n\nWhy don't more women use it?\n\nSep 24, 2023 \u2022\n\nArnold Kling\n\n50\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Strategy of Dating Short Men\n\narnoldkling.substack.com\n\n111\n\nI Condemn. . .But\n\nThe worst form of evil\n\nOct 14, 2023 \u2022\n\nArnold Kling\n\n99\n\nShare this post\n\n#### I Condemn. . .But\n\narnoldkling.substack.com\n\n80\n\nAssimilating Women into Male Institutions\n\nWe have not done it well\n\nMay 10, 2023 \u2022\n\nArnold Kling\n\n64\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Assimilating Women into Male Institutions\n\narnoldkling.substack.com\n\n61\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Arnold Kling\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
