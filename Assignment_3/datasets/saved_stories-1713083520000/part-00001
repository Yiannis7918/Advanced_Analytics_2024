But another,\nmore surprising answer ought to be your own house. About a tenth of the\nworld\u2019s residential property by value is under threat from global\nwarming\u2014including many houses that are nowhere near the coast. From tornadoes\nbattering midwestern American suburbs to tennis-ball-size hailstones smashing\nthe roofs of Italian villas, the severe weather brought about by greenhouse-\ngas emissions is shaking the foundations of the world\u2019s most important asset\nclass.\n\nThe potential costs stem from policies designed to reduce the emissions of\nhouses as well as from climate-related damage. They are enormous. By one\nestimate, climate change and the fight against it could wipe out 9% of the\nvalue of the world\u2019s housing by 2050\u2014which amounts to $25trn, not much less\nthan America\u2019s annual gDP. It is a huge bill hanging over people\u2019s lives and\nthe global financial system. And it looks destined to trigger an almighty\nfight over who should pay up.\n\n#### Already have an account?Log in\n\n## Get the full story\n\n### Enjoy a month of insightful analysis for free.
