But for every promise Musk has helped make a reality through\na company like SpaceX, there are many more the billionaire would probably like\npeople to forget about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk made some bold predictions on Monday about the future of artificial\nintelligence. The billionaire tech mogul earnestly seems to believe artificial\ngeneral intelligence (AGI), the point when AI can apply reason and logic in\nthe same way as humans, is just a year or two away.\n\n\u201cIf you define AGI as smarter than the smartest human, I think it\u2019s probably\nin the next year. Like within two years,\u201d Musk said during a chat with the\nhead of Norway\u2019s sovereign fund on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s still a pretty big leap beyond that to say smarter than the\nmachine-augmented human collective,\u201d Musk continued. \u201cSo like, is it smarter\nthan all humans working together who are also using computers to augment their\noutput? And that I think is probably five years away.\u201d\n\nIronically, Musk\u2019s talk on X Spaces was cut short because of technical\nproblems, something that\u2019s happened frequently when Musk has tried to host a\nchat over recent months. The idea that we\u2019re on the cusp of AGI while Musk\u2019s\nsocial media platform struggles with hosting a basic audio chat is pretty\nfunny to any outside observer.\n\nObviously, we\u2019ll just have to wait and see whether Musk\u2019s prediction on AGI\nproves correct. But there are plenty of people who don\u2019t think Musk\nunderstands just how far away we are from developing what most people would\nconsider AGI. Gary Marcus, the CEO of Geometric Intelligence, has offered to\nbet Musk $1 million that AI won\u2019t actually be \u201csmarter\u201d than humans by the end\nof 2025. Another CEO followed suit and offered $10 million.\n\nAs Marcus points out, computers have been \u201csmarter\u201d than humans for decades.\nSo the parameters of what Musk is talking about need to be defined in a\nclearer way. Much like the term \u201cartificial intelligence,\u201d the definition of\nAGI is still pretty hazy. But it makes for very cool-sounding headlines when\nMusk makes these proclamations.\n\nToday, we\u2019re taking a look at some of the promises and predictions that Musk\nhas made which haven\u2019t come true. It\u2019s entirely possible that some of these\nthings might become a reality in the future. But there have been enough\nfailures that it can be enlightening to look back and ask yourself what went\nwrong\u2014as well as what motivation Musk might have for hyping up technologies\nlong before they\u2019re ready.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrevious Slide\n\nNext Slide\n\n## Robotaxis by 2020\n\n## Robotaxis by 2020\n\nScreenshot: Tesla / YouTube (Fair Use)\n\nIn 2019, Musk made quite a prediction about the future of robotaxis.\n\n\u201cI feel very confident predicting autonomous robotaxis for Tesla next year.\nNot in all jurisdictions because we won\u2019t have regulatory approval everywhere.\nBut I\u2019m confident we will have at least regulatory approval somewhere\nliterally next year,\u201d Musk said back in April 2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t all. Musk said owning anything but a Tesla by 2022 would be\nlike owning a horse because only Tesla would have the autonomous driving\nsoftware required to deliver next-level capabilities.\n\n\u201cIf you buy a car that does not have the hardware for full self-driving, it is\nlike buying a horse,\u201d Musk said. \u201cAnd the only car that has the hardware for\nfull self-driving is a Tesla.\u201d\n\nMusk is still reportedly working on robotaxis behind the scenes. The Tesla CEO\nhas even promised to unveil a robotaxi in August. But there\u2019s a pretty wide\nconsensus that whatever Musk shows off to the world won\u2019t be a commercial\nrobotaxi service anytime soon.\n\nPlenty of other companies have been developing robotaxis\u2014like Cruise and\nWaymo\u2014but with trials and tribulations that have caused the companies to shut\ndown for extended periods of time following crashes and scandals. Robotaxis\nare hard, and it\u2019s entirely possible Musk could be the one to finally deliver\nthem at scale. But we\u2019ll believe it when we see it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrevious Slide\n\nNext Slide\n\n## Hyperloop to O\u2019Hare\n\n## Hyperloop to O\u2019Hare\n\nAnimation of Elon Musk\u2019s \u2018Loop\u201d transportation system that has since been\nscrubbed from Vimeo.Gif: The Boring Company / Vimeo\n\nMusk made a lot of bold predictions about the Hyperloop when he announced the\nconcept back in 2013. But the billionaire insisted he wouldn\u2019t be the one to\ndevelop the 600-mile-per-hour tech. Instead, Musk set his sights on a mass\ntransportation idea that was much more humble.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA Loop is like a Hyperloop, but without drawing a vacuum inside the tube.\nDon\u2019t need to get rid of air friction for short routes,\u201d Musk tweeted in Nov.\n2017.\n\nBy the next year, Musk was holding a press conference with the mayor of\nChicago to announce that the Boring Company would be building a tunnel\ncovering the 18 miles between downtown Chicago and O\u2019Hare Airport. It would\ndeliver passengers in about 12 minutes, according to Musk.\n\nThe Loop system even had some fancy animation of the autonomous 16-passenger\nvehicles that were supposed to be whipping around underground, as you can see\nabove. But that didn\u2019t happen. Musk\u2019s Loop has just one existing application\nand it\u2019s in Las Vegas. But it doesn\u2019t have any 16-passenger vehicles or\nincredibly fast speeds. It\u2019s just regular Tesla vehicles being driven by human\ndrivers slowly in a tunnel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrevious Slide\n\nNext Slide\n\n## Humans on Mars by 2024\n\n## Humans on Mars by 2024\n\nArtist\u2019s conception of a SpaceX Martian colonyImage: SpaceX\n\nOf all Musk\u2019s companies, SpaceX has arguably been the most impressive at\ndelivering results. The company has incredibly lucrative contracts with the\ngovernment launching payloads like spy satellites into space and Starlink\nsatellite internet has expanded access in hard-to-serve corners of the globe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Musk\u2019s predictions for space have also been some of the most ridiculous,\nespecially when he\u2019s put a timetable on plans for getting humans to Mars\u2014like\nthe time he imagined there might be humans there by 2024.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hopeful that the first people could be taken to Mars in 10 to 12 years, I\nthink it\u2019s certainly possible for that to occur,\u201d Musk told CNBC in June 2014.\n\nMusk reiterated that he wants to build a city on Mars, something he\u2019s talked\nabout for a very long time, even claiming that he\u2019d like to die on the red\nplanet (presumably of old age).\n\n\u201cBut the thing that matters long term is to have a self-sustaining city on\nMars, to make life multi-planetary,\u201d Musk said.\n\nWe\u2019re still quite a ways from putting humans on Mars, as we\u2019re currently doing\nour best to just return to the Moon. Space enthusiasts would obviously love to\nsee a person set foot on Mars, even if the details of Musk\u2019s plans for a\ncolony of 1 million people on the planet are weird and unrealistic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrevious Slide\n\nNext Slide\n\n## Trips Around the Moon by 2018\n\n## Trips Around the Moon by 2018\n\nPresident Barack Obama walks to look at the Falcon 9 launch vehicle with\nSpaceX CEO Elon Musk at Kennedy Space Center Thursday, April 15, 2010.Photo:\nAlex Brandon (AP)\n\nBack in 2017, Musk said that SpaceX would be flying private citizens around\nthe Moon by 2018. That hasn\u2019t happened yet, obviously, and the most recent\ngoal of trying to send paying customers around the Moon in 2023 also fell\nthrough.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NASA-led Artemis-2 mission is currently scheduled to fly humans around the\nMoon in September 2025, but there\u2019s no word from SpaceX about a new date for\nwhen average citizens might make the trip.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrevious Slide\n\nNext Slide\n\n## \u201cProbably close to zero new cases...\u201d\n\n## \u201cProbably close to zero new cases...\u201d\n\nElon Musk on September 25, 2020, in Los Angeles, California (left) and Musk\u2019s\ntweet from March 19, 2020.Image: zz/Wil R/STAR MAX/IPx (AP)\n\nOne of Musk\u2019s most infamous predictions comes from March 19, 2020, when the\nbillionaire predicted there would be \u201cprobably close to zero new cases\u201d of\ncovid-19 in the U.S. \u201cby the end of April.\u201d In reality, the U.S. was recording\nabout 20,000 new cases each day by the end of April 2020. But that didn\u2019t stop\nMusk from turning into a reactionary crank relatively early into the pandemic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFREE AMERICA NOW,\u201d Musk tweeted when there were 58,355 deaths in the U.S.\nfrom covid-19.\n\nThe U.S. has seen over 1.1 million deaths from covid-19 and millions more\nsuffering from longer-lasting effects of contracting the virus. Thankfully,\nwastewater detection indicates cases are extremely low right now, but the\nvirus never really went away. And experts predict it will be with us for the\nforeseeable future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrevious Slide\n\nNext Slide\n\n## Coast-to-Coast Autonomous Driving\n\n## Coast-to-Coast Autonomous Driving\n\nElon Musk leaves the executive committee meeting of the CDU/CSU in Westhafen\nin a Tesla on Sept 20, 2020.Photo: Fabian Sommer/picture-alliance/dpa (AP)\n\nBack in 2016, Musk predicted Tesla drivers would be able to summon their cars\nfrom anywhere connected by land, including from New York to Los Angeles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn ~2 years, summon should work anywhere connected by land & not blocked by\nborders, eg you\u2019re in LA and the car is in NY,\u201d Musk tweeted in January 2016.\n\nWhen the year 2018 rolled around without Teslas being able to do that, Musk\ndidn\u2019t admit he was wrong. Instead, he insisted it was just around the corner.\n\n\u201cTime-wise, we could probably do a coast-to-coast drive in 3 months, 6 months\nin the outside,\u201d Musk claimed in February 2018.\n\nWe\u2019re still waiting on that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrevious Slide\n\nNext Slide\n\n## Full Self-Driving \u201cNext Year\u201d\n\n## Full Self-Driving \u201cNext Year\u201d\n\nElon Musk promising #Tesla robotaxis next year for almost a decade. #tesla\n#elonmusk #spacex\n\nA viral video, which was deleted from YouTube by the original creator, but has\nbeen re-uploaded by others, is simply a supercut of Musk promising fully\nautonomous driving \u201cnext year.\u201d The problem, it seems, is that he made the\n\u201cnext year\u201d promise over and over and over again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrevious Slide\n\nNext Slide\n\n## AI More Dangerous Than Nukes\n\n## AI More Dangerous Than Nukes\n\nElon Musk speaks at Nasdaq before the opening bell for Tesla\u2019s initial public\noffering on June 29, 2010, in New York.Photo: Mark Lennihan (AP)\n\nMusk has been instrumental in developing generative AI tech, first as a major\ninvestor in OpenAI, but then as a major competitor to the creator of ChatGPT.\nOn the surface, Musk has always warned of the dangers of AI, while also trying\nto develop it, creating a strange kind of cognitive dissonance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWorth reading Superintelligence by Bostrom. We need to be super careful with\nAI. Potentially more dangerous than nukes,\u201d Musk tweeted in August 2014.\n\nMany people pointed out at the time this was a rather absurd thing to say,\neven if all our brains have been poisoned by dystopian sci-fi. And it\u2019s easy\nto see how people could still be worried about this stuff due to the\nsensationalistic media coverage.\n\nLarge-language models have opened up new doors for people in the world of\nchatbots and Musk has clearly been impressed, launching his own version with\nGrok on X and starting his own AI company headquartered in Nevada. Tools like\nChatGPT, Grok, and Gemini allow people to ask questions and receive a response\nthat sounds remarkably like a human. But the dirty little secret about this AI\nhype cycle is that even though they sound like they\u2019re applying logic and\nreason to various questions, that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening under the hood.\n\nThese LLMs work as predictive text machines. They work by spitting out words\nat an incredibly rapid rate that can trick us into thinking there\u2019s some real\n\u201cthinking\u201d going on. But if you ask the chatbots illogical questions they\u2019ve\nnever heard before, it can become clear they\u2019re not actually applying any kind\nof deep reasoning.\n\nIt\u2019s entirely possible that AI could be very dangerous in the future, but the\nidea that it\u2019s because Skynet is just over the horizon simply isn\u2019t grounded\nin reality. The danger of AI is people believing it can do many more things\nbeyond its real capabilities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrevious Slide\n\nNext Slide\n\n## Elon Musk\u2019s Candy Company\n\n## Elon Musk\u2019s Candy Company\n\nElon Musk drinks during an in-conversation event with Britain\u2019s Prime Minister\nRishi Sunak in London, Thursday, Nov. 2, 2023.Photo: Kirsty Wigglesworth (AP)\n\nRemember when Musk said he was going to start a candy company?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m starting a candy company & it\u2019s going to be amazing,\u201d Musk tweeted in May\n2018. \u201cI am super super serious.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk never started a candy company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrevious Slide\n\nNext Slide\n\n## Tesla Will Have a 1,000-Kilometer (621 Mile) Range\n\n## Tesla Will Have a 1,000-Kilometer (621 Mile) Range\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk unveils the new Tesla factory in Fremont, Calif.,\nWednesday, Oct. 27, 2010.Photo: Paul Sakuma (AP)\n\n\u201cThe record right now for the Model S is 800 kilometers (497 miles).

Needless to say, this prediction\ndidn\u2019t pan out by 2017, nor has it happened in the seven years after that. The\nrecord for the longest distance driven in a Tesla is 901 kilometers (roughly\n560 miles) and that was only achieved because of some absolutely bonkers\nconditions. For example, the drivers planned meticulously and maximized every\npossible efficiency, driving in a closed loop at an average speed of just 24\nmiles per hour.\n\nEven under those conditions, it\u2019s still a long way from 1,000 kilometers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe may earn a commission from links on this page.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
