In\nturn, many countries have developed a solution for remote workers who wish to\nlive abroad by offering special digital nomad visas that allow extended stays.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in working remotely in another country, here\u2019s what you\nshould know when applying for a digital nomad visa, as well as which countries\nare accepting remote workers.\n\n## What is a digital nomad visa?\n\nRemote employees who work from more than one location are often called digital\nnomads \u2014 they have no fixed office and can earn an income from wherever they\nwant. While some only travel within their home country, others work from\nabroad.\n\nHowever, many countries limit travelers without a visa to a short visit \u2014\ntypically one to three months. Additionally, working in any country without a\nvisa, or with a tourist visa, may be illegal, depending on your citizenship\nand the country\u2019s immigration and employment regulations.\n\nSo, how do you get around this potential issue? The answer is a digital nomad\nvisa, which is a temporary residency permit for remote workers who are\nemployed and paid by foreign companies.\n\nIn other words, you\u2019re allowed to stay and work legally in the country that\nissued you a digital nomad visa.\n\nDepending on the country, the visa may allow you to stay for as long as a year\nor longer, and there may be an option to extend if you still meet the\nrequirements.\n\n\ud83e\udd13Nerdy Tip\n\nBecause of U.S. and foreign tax laws, a digital nomad visa might be a little\neasier to obtain for independent contractors or freelancers rather than full-\ntime W-2 employees. In either case, you\u2019ll need to talk with your boss or HR\nrepresentative and ask if it\u2019s possible to not only work outside the office,\nbut work in another country.\n\n\u00bb Learn more: Has remote work changed the travel landscape?\n\n## Digital nomad visa countries\n\nMore than 50 countries offer visas for digital nomads.\n\nCountries with digital nomad visas\n\n  * Albania.\n\n  * Andorra.\n\n  * Anguilla.\n\n  * Antigua and Barbuda.\n\n  * Argentina.\n\n  * Armenia.\n\n  * Barbados.\n\n  * Belize.\n\n  * Bermuda.\n\n  * Brazil.\n\n  * Cabo Verde.\n\n  * Cayman Islands.\n\n  * Colombia.\n\n  * Costa Rica.\n\n  * Croatia.\n\n  * Cura\u00e7ao.\n\n  * Cyprus.\n\n  * Czechia.\n\n  * Dominica.\n\n  * Ecuador.\n\n  * El Salvador.\n\n  * Estonia.\n\n  * Georgia.\n\n  * Germany.\n\n  * Greece.\n\n  * Grenada.\n\n  * Hungary.\n\n  * Iceland.\n\n  * India.\n\n  * Indonesia.\n\n  * Italy.\n\n  * Latvia.\n\n  * Malaysia.\n\n  * Malta.\n\n  * Mauritius.\n\n  * Mexico.\n\n  * Montenegro.\n\n  * Montserrat.\n\n  * Namibia.\n\n  * North Macedonia.\n\n  * Norway.\n\n  * Panama.\n\n  * Portugal.\n\n  * Romania.\n\n  * Saint Lucia.\n\n  * Serbia.\n\n  * Seychelles.\n\n  * South Africa.\n\n  * South Korea.\n\n  * Spain.\n\n  * Sri Lanka.\n\n  * Taiwan.\n\n  * Thailand.\n\n  * The Bahamas.\n\n  * United Arab Emirates.\n\n  * Uruguay.\n\nHere's a selection of countries with digital nomad visas to give you an idea\nof your options.\n\n### 1\\. Estonia\n\nEstonia was the first country to offer what\u2019s now called a digital nomad visa.\nYou can apply if you work for a company outside of Estonia.\n\n  * Application fee: $109 (100 euros).\n\n  * Duration: One year.\n\n  * Monthly income requirement: $3,825 (3,504 euros).\n\n  * Proof of remote employment: Work contract with a company outside of Estonia.\n\n  * Additional requirements: Bank statements from the last six months and valid health insurance coverage of at least $32,749 (30,000 euros).\n\nEstonia is part of the Schengen zone, and its digital nomad visa allows you to\nvisit other Schengen countries for up to 90 days within a 180-day period.\n\n\u00bb Learn more: Tips for buying Schengen zone travel insurance\n\n### 2\\. Portugal\n\nPortugal offers a temporary stay visa that lets remote workers reside and work\nin the country for a non-Portuguese employer.\n\n  * Application fee: $82 (75 euros).\n\n  * Duration: One year.\n\n  * Monthly income requirement: $3,319 (3,040 euros).\n\n  * Minimum bank balance: $39,827 (36,480 euros).\n\n  * Proof of remote employment: Work contract or partnership agreement.\n\n  * Additional requirements: Valid health insurance coverage in Portugal.\n\nIf you reside in Portugal as a digital nomad for at least 183 days in a\ncalendar year, you\u2019ll attain taxed residency status. However, you\u2019ll also be\neligible to apply for non-habitual resident status, which reduces your tax\nburden from 48% to 20%.\n\n### 3\\. Mexico\n\nMexico is also a good choice for American digital nomads who want to avoid\ntime zone differences. It offers a temporary resident visa for those who want\nto work remotely while exploring what the country has to offer.\n\n  * Application fee: $40 (plus $150 to $350 for a residence card).\n\n  * Duration: Six months to four years.\n\n  * Monthly income requirement: $2,595.\n\n  * Additional requirement: Valid health insurance coverage.\n\nIf you don\u2019t earn $2,595 per month, you can still qualify for a temporary\nresidence permit if you can show a balance of at least $43,000 in your bank\naccount for the past 12 months. To apply, you must schedule an appointment at\nan embassy or a consulate in your home state or country.\n\n\u00bb Learn more: Remote work visa opportunities (and how to get there on points)\n\n### 4\\. Colombia\n\nOne of the easier digital nomad visas to qualify for in terms of monthly\nincome is Colombia\u2019s Visa V N\u00f3madas Digitales, available to foreigners looking\nto live in and work remotely from Colombia.\n\n  * Application fee: $52. If approved, an additional visa fee of $170 to $230 is required.\n\n  * Duration: Two years. However, you can only stay 180 days within a one-year period.\n\n  * Monthly income requirement: $738 (3 million Colombian pesos).\n\n  * Proof of remote employment: Work contract or proof of business ownership.\n\n  * Additional requirement: Valid health insurance coverage.\n\n### 5\\. Saint Lucia\n\nTo get a taste of island life without the large price tag, you can apply for\nthe Saint Lucia Live It program.\n\n  * Application fee: $75 (paid on arrival).\n\n  * Duration: One year.\n\n  * Monthly income requirement: None.\n\n  * Proof of remote employment: Work contract or job letter.\n\nSaint Lucia doesn\u2019t have minimum monthly income requirements, doesn\u2019t tax\ndigital nomads and offers a multi-entry visa for 12 months. Its relatively low\ncost of living (when compared wiy the U.S.) makes it a desirable location for\nremote workers.\n\n### 6\\. Malaysia\n\nThe Southeast Asian country of Malaysia has fairly accessible requirements for\nits version of the digital nomad visa, called De Rantau Nomad Pass.\n\n  * Application fee: $214 (1,000 Malaysian ringgit).\n\n  * Duration: Three to 12 months, with option to renew another year.\n\n  * Yearly income requirements: $24,000 (or $2,000 per month).\n\n  * Proof of remote employment: You must be working in the tech industry.\n\nAlthough your job must be in the tech industry, the definition is rather loose\nand includes digital creators, marketing professionals, software developers\nand cybersecurity specialists.\n\nDigital nomads are also allowed to work for a Malaysian company. Though the\nannual income requirement is reduced to $7,704 (36,000 Malaysian ringgit),\nyou\u2019ll have to pay local taxes.\n\nThose working for foreign companies don\u2019t need to pay taxes on their income in\nMalaysia.\n\n## Advantages of a digital nomad visa\n\nWhile organizing all of the necessary paperwork, approvals and logistics can\nbe a hassle, getting a digital nomad visa comes with some real advantages,\nnamely experiencing life abroad and being able to live like a local.\n\n### Ability to live and work overseas\n\nThe chance to live and work abroad is the number one reason to apply for a\ndigital nomad visa.\n\nYou can legally live and work in a foreign country for an extended period of\ntime, get paid in your home country\u2019s currency and use the free time to\nexplore the city or country you\u2019ve chosen. For many travelers, this is the\nopportunity of a lifetime.\n\n### Ability to stay in one place longer\n\nIf you\u2019re traveling somewhere as a tourist, you\u2019re only given a certain\ntimeframe to visit before you have to leave the country. In some countries,\nyou could be allowed to stay 90, or even 180, days, but in others, you may\nonly have 30 days.\n\nWith a digital nomad visa, you don\u2019t have to worry about leaving the country\nevery couple of months to fulfill immigration requirements.\n\n\u00bb Learn more: Why hotels make great coworking spaces for remote workers\n\n## Disadvantages of being a digital nomad\n\nDespite the appealing opportunity to live and work abroad, there are some\ndownsides to the digital nomad lifestyle, too.\n\n### Potential tax implications\n\nDepending on the country you go to, you might be taxed as a resident \u2014 even\nfor short-term stays. In some places, your tax liability can represent a\nhigher amount than what you\u2019re used to in your home country, or you might have\nto pay taxes in both your home and host country. Not to mention, researching\ntax obligations could involve lots of time, paperwork and possibly even a\nlawyer.\n\n### Getting used to a new schedule\n\nIf you\u2019re a freelancer who sets your own work hours, this may not apply to\nyou. However, if you have a set work schedule, you\u2019ll have to manage time zone\nshifts and adjust your work hours accordingly.\n\nIf you normally work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST in New York City, you\u2019re going\nto have to shift your day by five to seven hours when working remotely from\nEurope \u2014 your work day might end between 10 p.m. and midnight.\n\nThis becomes even more complicated if you\u2019ve decided to work from somewhere\nlike Malaysia, which is 13 hours ahead of the U.S. East Coast. Your work\nschedule there would begin at 10 p.m. and end at 6 a.m. local time.\n\n\u00bb Learn more: Workcations: Should your next trip mix work and play?\n\n## How do I apply for a digital nomad visa?\n\nOnce you\u2019ve decided you want to work as a digital nomad, you\u2019ll need to apply\nfor a visa. The application process and cost of the visa vary widely by\ncountry. However, in most cases, you have to already be employed, have\nadequate health insurance coverage and prove you have sufficient income to\ncover your expenses.\n\nFor example, to apply for a 12-month residency permit to live in Croatia,\nyou\u2019ll need to be employed by a foreign company or be an independent\ncontractor. You also need to show proof of at least $31,550 in a personal bank\naccount and health insurance coverage.\n\nConversely, Belize offers a 6-month digital nomad visa in which you must show\nproof of a minimal annual income of $75,000 as well as employment with a\nforeign employer. A travel insurance policy is also required.\n\n\u00bb Learn more: Best places to work remotely\n\n## Digital nomad visas recapped\n\nFollowing the rise of remote workers, which was exacerbated by the pandemic,\nmany countries have introduced their own versions of digital nomad visas to\nlure in remote workers and their money.\n\nThe option can be appealing to those embracing a location-independent\nlifestyle or who just want to experience life in another country.\n\nIf you have a remote job that\u2019ll let you work abroad, and you want to trade in\nyour home office for the world, you have plenty of options.\n\n### How to maximize your rewards\n\nYou want a travel credit card that prioritizes what\u2019s important to you.
