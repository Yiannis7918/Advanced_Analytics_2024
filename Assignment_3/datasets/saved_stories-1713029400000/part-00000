By day, she works as a Twilio\ndeveloper evangelist, and by night, is a substitute tennis coach at Golden\nGate Park, a lead with Urban Environmentalists, and a volunteer with SF YIMBY.\n\nTo bike in San Francisco is to learn about and love the city, getting to know\nit both familiarly and lovingly. Riders become acquainted with the streets,\nthe hills, and the people in a manner they can\u2019t get from a car or Muni. To\nbike with a group is to move as one. To bike with a Bike Party is to fly and\nsing in harmony with people who may have nothing in common but their shared\nmethod of transit.\n\nIn February, I attended my first Bike Party, the East Bay Bike Party, and\nloved it so much that I had to write about it. The sheer number of cyclists,\nlights, costumes, music, dancing, routine cheers of \u201cBike party!\u201d and the\noverall joy... I was in awe. I couldn't stop talking about it to anyone who\nwould listen! Although words cannot do this jubilant celebration of people and\nriding justice, I had to try\u2013and after finally attending my first San\nFrancisco Bike Party three months later, I\u2019m trying once more.\n\nThough some drizzling did deter some riders (including the three friends who\nsaid they would go with me) from this month\u2019s Cinco de Mayo ride, the weather\ncould not dampen the festivities. At Precita Park, the first stop of the\nnight, I took part in an SF Bike Party tradition: I bought a burrito for $10\nfrom an attendee whose wife works at a restaurant and makes them for each SF\nBike Party. Munching on it contentedly alongside other attendees, I couldn't\nhelp but notice the diversity in age, background, race, costume, bike type,\nand how many attendees came from outside the city. It wasn't as diverse as the\nEast Bay Bike Party, but it was more diverse than many would expect.\n\nI would be remiss not to mention hills in an article about biking in San\nFrancisco. They weren't as bad as I had expected, and going through them with\nthe Party made them less noticeable. Cars and onlookers honked and cheered us\non. Yes, some yelled at us angrily for taking up space that society has been\nconditioned to believe should be for cars. Still, we trekked on \u2013 nothing\ncould dampen the mood.\n\nThough this was a smaller Bike Party (hey, SF isn\u2019t a big city), spirits were\nnot lacking\u2013gosh darn it, we took up our government-given space, celebrating\nand riding unitedly. I actually found it easier to meet new people and\nremember names as everyone grew familiar throughout the night. SF\u2019s Bike Party\nwas more intimate because I saw the same people at each stop and throughout\nthe ride, making everything more tight-knit. I took down more names and phone\nnumbers from potential biking buddies, appreciating the rapport that we built\nfrom biking alongside each other and seeing each other throughout the ride and\nat different stops. I met this ride\u2019s volunteer lead, SF native Luna\nArciniega, and I couldn't imagine meeting the lead at EBBP. She was kind,\npassionate, and caring, and did an excellent job leading her first ride. I\nhope to volunteer with her on future ones!\n\nI thought I would leave en route from the second to the third stop because I\nlive in-between them, but was having such a good time that I chose to go all\nthe way. The staccato beats of my heart matched the staccato beats of the\ntunes pumping from portable speakers on the backs of bikes as the Party\ncontinued through downtown to Pier 27 along the Embarcadero. A new friend kept\nme preoccupied as we took in the views and vibes of other riders dancing near\nthe water so much that I barely noticed we were some of the last attendees\nstanding as everyone said their goodbyes!\n\nYet it wasn't the end: there's the East Bay Bike Party the following Friday,\nthen San Jose Bike Party the Friday after that, SF Critical Mass the last\nFriday of the month, and then back again to SF Bike Party on the first Friday\nof the month. I hope to see you there\u2013more people should experience such a\nmagical night with such magical people. Each event and location is different,\nbut it\u2019s the hearts of the attendees that make each event a welcoming\ncommunity.\n\n  * Share on Facebook\n  * Share on X (formerly Twitter)\n  * Share on Reddit\n  * Share on Email\n\nDamien Newton\n\n## Stay in touch\n\nSign up for our free newsletter\n\n## More from Streetsblog San Francisco\n\nHeadlines\n\n### Headlines, April 12\n\nApril 12, 2024\n\nToday's Headlines\n\n### Headlines, April 11\n\nApril 11, 2024\n\nStreetsblog CaliforniaStreetsblog California\n\n### More Early Bill Approvals: E-bike Classifications and Batteries, Adding\nMalibu to Speed Camera Program\n\nApril 11, 2024\n\n### Streetsblog San Francisco is Taking a Spring Break\n\nRoger Rudick\n\nApril 10, 2024\n\nToday's Headlines\n\n### Headlines, April 10\n\nApril 10, 2024\n\nSee all posts\n\nCovering San Francisco's livable streets movement\n\n## Stay in touch\n\nSign up for our free newsletter\n\n  * Streetsblog San Francisco Facebook\n  * Streetsblog San Francisco X (formerly Twitter)\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2024\n\nMade in partnership with Lede\n\n", "frontpage": false}
