We have the definitive answer.\n\nBy\n\nSusan B. Barnes\n\nSusan B. Barnes\n\nSusan is a food, travel and lifestyle journalist who is as comfortable\nexperimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.\n\nAllrecipes' editorial guidelines\n\nPublished on April 2, 2024\n\nTrending Videos\n\nI have a confession to make: I\u2019m a pre-rinser. Before I load dirty dishes into\nour dishwasher, I thoroughly rinse them off so that they\u2019re nearly clean\nbefore being placed in the racks. But I\u2019m not sure why I do it. Perhaps it was\nthe thing to do when I was growing up and doing my chores, or maybe it\u2019s\nbecause I\u2019m worried about the water pressure and plumbing in our 1940s home.\n\nTurns out, I\u2019m not alone in my pre-rinsing habit. A recent survey commissioned\nby Procter & Gamble shows that 86% of us pre-rinse or pre-wash as part of our\ndishwashing routines.\n\nI began to wonder, is my taking the time to pre-rinse dishes before loading\nthem into the dishwasher beneficial in any way, or is it a waste of time and\nresources, like water? I reached out to dishwasher detergent giant Cascade to\nfind the answers.\n\n## Do You Need to Pre-Wash Your Dishes Before Putting Them in the Dishwasher?\n\nAccording to Cascade Senior Scientist Morgan Eberhard, the answer is no. But\nthere is a caveat.\n\n\u201cYou want to make sure to scrape off any chunks of remaining food that could\npotentially gunk up or clog your machine, but go ahead and leave that last\nlayer of food soil, sauces, and grease on the dishes,\u201d advises Eberhard. \u201cNo\nneed to turn the water on at all.\u201d\n\nShe adds that we can all save water and energy, not to mention time, by using\nthe dishwasher and skipping the pre-rinse-wash.\n\n\u201cEnergy Star-certified dishwashers use less than four gallons of water in one\ncycle; a running sink can use the same amount in just two minutes,\u201d Eberhard\ntells Allrecipes. \u201cBy skipping the sink and using your dishwasher every day,\nyou can save 100 gallons of water per week.\"\n\n\u201cEnergy Star-certified dishwashers also use less energy than washing dishes at\nthe sink, so you can save money on your utility bill by using the dishwasher\nas well,\u201d she adds.\n\nThinking of my home\u2019s aging, and perhaps fragile, plumbing, I asked Eberhard\nhow dishwasher soaps like Cascade break down the food, sauces, and grease left\nof dirty plates sitting in the dishwasher.\n\n\u201cSuper-packed dishwasher detergent [like Cascade Platinum Plus!] has a\npowerful combination of cleaning ingredients that hydrate and scrub tough,\ndried-on food resulting in virtually spot-free, cabinet-ready dishes,\u201d she\nexplains. \u201cThe dual-power cleaning formula is composed of starch-fighting and\nprotein-fighting enzymes that break down tough-to-clean foods better than ever\nbefore.\u201d\n\n## Tips for Loading a Dishwasher Efficiently\n\nNow that we have the definitive answer that it\u2019s not necessary to pre-rinse or\npre-wash dishes before loading them into the dishwasher, I asked Eberhard for\nher tips on how to make sure our dishes come out spotless every time.\n\n### Cascade Senior Scientist Morgan Eberhard\n\n\u201cThe most important thing to remember when loading the dishwasher is that the\nwater coming from the spray arms has to be able to reach the dirty part of the\ndish. If bowls are nesting together or dishes are stacked on top of one\nanother, the water won\u2019t be able to get to them, meaning the detergent won\u2019t\nbe able to break down the food and grease left on the dish.\"\n\n\u2014 Cascade Senior Scientist Morgan Eberhard\n\n\u201cMake sure each dish has a clear path to the water source in each load for\noptimal cleaning,\u201d Eberhard continues. \u201cThe same goes for your flatware. By\ndesign, spoons like to, well, spoon. Try to mix up what type of utensils are\nin each section of your cutlery basket so they don\u2019t end up resting together.\u201d\n\nShe adds that the best way to ensure forks and spoons are their cleanest when\nthey come out of the dishwasher is to load them standing up, \u201cso the dirtiest\npart is more exposed to the water instead of getting packed into the bottom of\nthe basket.\u201d Be sure to load knives down for safety, \u201cso you don\u2019t\naccidentally cut yourself while unloading.\u201d\n\nAdditional dishwasher loading tips from Cascade include:\n\n  * Double check items are dishwasher safe: A dishwasher may be too rough for some prized kitchen items, or might not be appropriate for some materials, like wood, aluminum, and cast iron. Be sure to double-check that all items are dishwasher safe before loading if you\u2019re unsure.\n  * Load the bottom rack: Put plates and messy, burnt-on pots and pans on the bottom rack in the direction of the prongs, facing the water source. Typically, the water source is in the center of the machine, and you want as clear a path as possible between the spray and your dirty dishes.\n  * Load the top rack: Place cups, mugs, and bowls face down on the top rack between prongs to prevent rattling. This way, they\u2019ll also get cleaned better and won\u2019t collect water, which can leave behind unsightly deposits. With wine glasses and other delicate glassware, load them a finger-width apart on the top rack and utilize the stemware holder, if your dishwasher has one, to keep them in place so they don\u2019t fall over. Plasticware also belongs on the top rack. Temperatures typically remain cooler on the top rack, which will prevent plastic from melting.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nThanks for your feedback!\n\nTell us why!\n\nAllrecipes\n\nNewsletters\n\n## Follow Us\n\n  * About Us\n  * Editorial Process\n  * Anti-Racism Pledge\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Product Vetting\n  * Terms of Service\n  * Advertise\n  * Careers\n  * Contact\n  * EU Privacy\n\nAllrecipes is part of the Dotdash Meredith publishing family.\n\nPlease review our updated Terms of Service.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up\n\nNewsletter Sign Up\n\n## We Care About Your Privacy\n\nWe and our 100 partners store and/or access information on a device, such as\nunique IDs in cookies to process personal data.
