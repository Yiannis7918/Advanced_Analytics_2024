[+] Century Economy' panel during the The\nJuggernaut Summit 2023 at Spring Studios on September 22, 2023 in New York\nCity. (Photo by Roy Rochlin/Getty Images)\n\nGetty Images\n\nThere have been many articles written about the inevitable takedown of the\nfemale founder. Sara Mauskopf, CEO and co-founder of Winnie, said, \u201cWe love to\ncelebrate the rise of female-founded companies... until they rise too far.\u201d\nFemale founder takedown articles have been about hyped-up companies with\nfounders who were put on pedestals, who were celebrated on the covers of\nglossy magazines, and who raised hundreds of millions in venture funding. Most\nimportantly, there was always an egregious incident of sexual harassment,\nfraud, the founder lying about their credentials, racism, an unsafe space for\nunderrepresented groups, a toxic work environment, or a pattern of overworking\nemployees at the center of the articles.\n\nThe reporters who published these stories received backlash for judging female\nfounders more harshly than men and being unfair to women. \u201cThese are dynamics\nthat need to be called out and eliminated at all companies, whether female or\nmale-led... targeting female founders and CEOs does nothing to encourage\ngender equality. It only ensures that the number of female CEOs is dwindling\nunder the pressure of living up to stricter standards than men,\u201d says\nMauskopf. Now, the zeitgeist of the startup ecosystem is that we should be\nmore supportive of female founders.\n\nAccordingly, during Women\u2019s History Month, it was shocking to read a recent\ntakedown article in Business Insider about Snigdha Sur, the Founder and CEO of\nthe Juggernaut. The article, which is written by Senior Reporter Katie Warren\nand titled South Asian news startup The Juggernaut is struggling to stay\nafloat amid fundraising woes, disenchanted staffers, and a CEO in \"constant\ncrisis,\u201d ex-employees say, is downright damning and unfair. The article\nmentions no allegations of fraud, sexual harassment, Sur lying about her\ncredentials, or creating an unsafe work environment for underrepresented\ngroups. The article mentions anonymous sources and provides no supporting\nevidence, such as Slack screenshots or contractual equity/ payment agreements.\nSo why was this article published? No one writes takedown articles about such\nearly-stage companies. More importantly, as a founder, Sur was never put on a\npedestal previously, and she never did anything egregious to warrant a\ntakedown in the first place.\n\n__________________________________________________________\n\n## \u201cAs an Indian American woman, Sur most likely had a much harder time\nraising money than a white male (or white female) founder would have. In 2022,\nstartups founded by women of color received only 0.39% of VC funds.\u201d\n\n__________________________________________________________\n\nIronically, Warren included a paragraph about how hard it is for female\nfounders and even harder for South Asian female founders to raise venture\ncapital funding for their startups within the slam piece. It stated, \u201cRaising\nventure-capital money has been challenging in the past couple of years as the\nmarket has corrected from what Kyle Stanford, the lead US venture-capital\nresearch analyst at PitchBook, described as an \"overheated\" 2020 and 2021,\nwhich saw record-breaking investments in startups. As an Indian American\nwoman, Sur most likely had a much harder time raising money than a white male\nfounder would have. In 2022, startups founded by women of color received only\n0.39% of VC funds. Still, The Juggernaut's piecemeal approach to raising money\n\"would definitely be more typical of a company that's struggling. \u2019\u2019 Stanford\nsaid. Going 3 1\u20442 years without closing a fundraising round is unusual, even\nin today's market, Stanford, the PitchBook analyst, said, adding that the\ntypical time between rounds is closer to 1 1\u20442 years.\u201d Several VCs I have\nspoken with said these conclusions are unfair and could be wrong. In this\nenvironment, many of the most hyped companies are raising a combo of VC\n(equity financing) and debt financing and not disclosing that some of the\nfunds received are actually debt financing or down rounds.\n\nMORE FROMFORBES ADVISOR\n\n### Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\n\nBy\n\nKevin Payne\n\nContributor\n\n### Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\n\nBy\n\nCassidy Horton\n\nContributor\n\nThe article failed to include the macro trends of the tech and venture\necosystem, such as the number of unicorns that are shutting down and the\nripple effects of higher interest rates. Higher interest rates have increased\nVCs\u2019 return expectations, causing them to become more selective and deploy\nless capital. As a result, investment activity has decreased. The article\nfailed to note how it\u2019s harder for most founders to fundraise; even founding\npartners of venture funds are having a rough time in this market. Many\nstartups and venture funds are hobbling along.\n\nIt\u2019s too early to judge the Juggernaut. Unlike Outdoor Voices, it is not\nplanning to file for bankruptcy. The Juggernaut has successfully created a\nvery engaged online community with a large, organic social media following due\nto its content with a community of more than 10,000 paying subscribers.\nBusiness Insider named it one of the top media startups to watch. In June\n2023, The Guardian published a glowing write-up describing The Juggernaut as\n\"the website that found a refreshing way to tell a community's story.\"\n\n__________________________________________________________\n\n## The South Asian community is less cohesive than other communities because\nof its vast cultural diversity, religions, and languages. We need publications\nlike the Juggernaut to unite us and give us representation, support, and\nvoice. Sur is correct that \"South Asians deserve the same targeted, exclusive\nfocus\" as other communities.\n\n__________________________________________________________\n\nThe South Asian community is less cohesive than other communities because of\nits vast cultural diversity, religions, and languages. We need publications\nlike the Juggernaut to unite us and give us representation, support, and\nvoice. Sur is correct that \"South Asians deserve the same targeted, exclusive\nfocus\" as other communities.\n\nSur has been successful as a founder. She raised $3 million in seed funding\nand is a YC alumna. Despite her impressive educational and professional\nbackground, which includes a degree from Yale, a Harvard MBA, and a stint at\nMcKinsey, $3M is not that much funding, and that paltry amount was hard to\nraise because she is a South Asian American female founder with a digital\nmedia startup for South Asians. Diversity funds and initiatives don\u2019t include\nSouth Asian female founders. They are typically only reserved for funding\nBlack, Latin, and Native Americans as per Softbank\u2019s Opportunity Fund or\nAndreesen Horowitz\u2019s Talent X Opportunity Fund.\n\nMoreover, most VCs don\u2019t appreciate the void that the Juggernaut fills for the\nSouth Asian community and the representation and voice it provides. According\nto Axios, more than 50% of The Juggernaut's investment by value came from\ngeneral partners of color. Underrepresented investors understood the\nopportunity and value of the Juggernaut.\n\nThe BI article states that Charles Hudson of Precursor Ventures, The\nJuggernaut's biggest investor, said the outlet's employee turnover was on par\nwith other companies in his firm's portfolio. \"Working in very, very early-\nstage startups is often different than working with more mature\norganizations,\" he said. \"And for some people, they try the startup thing and\nit's just not a great fit for them.\" He said that he was optimistic about The\nJuggernaut under Sur's leadership and that he would continue to invest. \"I\nthink she's kind of in a race against herself,\" Hudson said. \"It's not like\nthere's a mini Juggernaut nipping at her heels. For us, we're always looking\nfor companies that we think can kind of pioneer something new, ideally create\nsomething that feels unique and iconic. And I think she has that opportunity\nwith The Juggernaut.\"\n\n__________________________________________________________\n\n## If she is struggling to keep her company afloat, she isn\u2019t the only one,\nand that\u2019s not news. The nature of early stage startups is constant crisis.\nThe assumption that a seed-stage company isn\u2019t in crisis is a joke.\n\n__________________________________________________________\n\nThe South Asian community is less cohesive than other communities because of\nits vast cultural diversity, religions, and languages.

Sur is correct that \"South Asians deserve the same targeted, exclusive\nfocus\" as other communities.\n\nSur didn\u2019t deserve the takedown article, especially since and it is even\nharder for South Asian female founders to raise venture capital funding for\ntheir startups which Warren admitted in her article. What Sur has accomplished\nwith $3M in funding is impressive. Sure, she has made some mistakes, but she\nisn\u2019t alone. Nearly every early-stage startup founder has made some mistakes.\nIf she is struggling to keep her company afloat, she isn\u2019t the only one, and\nthat\u2019s not news. The nature of early stage startups is constant crisis.
