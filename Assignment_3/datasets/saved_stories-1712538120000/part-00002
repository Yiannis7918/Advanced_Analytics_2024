This week we try to understand why.\n\nChris Dalla Riva\n\nApr 04, 2024\n\n36\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Land Where the CD Never Died\n\nchrisdallariva.substack.com\n\n16\n\nShare\n\nArticle voiceover\n\n1\u00d7\n\n0:00\n\n-19:20\n\nEach year, we get industry reports from music organizations like the RIAA, the\nIFPI, and Luminate. The top line numbers for 2023 are worth celebrating.\nAccording to the IFPI, total recorded music revenues crossed $28.6 billion in\n2023, up 10.5% from 2022 and 58.7% from 2019. Of course, much of this was\ndriven by the global proliferation of streaming, but there was also growth in\nphysical sales.\n\nAnytime you read about the physical format revival, it is almost always\nfocused on vinyl. But as I was digging through this year\u2019s IFPI report, I was\nsurprised to see that the CD market is still generating billions of dollars.\nIn fact, 36% of those billions come from just one country: Japan. This week I\ndecided to try to figure out why the Japanese love their CDs. As always, this\nnewsletter is also available as a podcast on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and\nSubstack.\n\nDid Streaming Really Kill the Compact Disc Star?\n\nWhen Sony and Philips introduced the compact disc (CD) to label heads at a\nconference in 1981, their innovation was not well received. In journalist\nSteve Knopper\u2019s book Appetite for Self-Destruction: The Spectacular Crash of\nthe Record Industry in the Digital Age, Jay Timmer, an early CD advocate and\nthen-head of PolyGram Records, recalls the industry response: \u201cHostile. Very\nhostile. I am fortunate there weren\u2019t any rotten tomatoes in the room.\nOtherwise, they would have thrown them at me.\u201d\n\nThere were clear advantages to CDs over other popular formats available at the\ntime. Primarily, they didn\u2019t degrade like cassettes and vinyl. They were also\nvery portable. Though some people argued that CDs were of inferior sound\nquality compared to vinyl, the record industry\u2019s initial opposition had little\nto do with that. Switching over to a new format was just expensive.\nManufacturing plants would have to be revamped to make CDs. Studios would need\nto be fitted with new gear to record digitally. Record stores would even have\nto rebuild their displays.\n\nVinyl display case at Skippy White\u2019s Boston record shop [Credit: Boston.com]\n\nBut the industry did an about face when they realized something else: They\ncould charge almost double for a CD compared to what they could charge for\nvinyl. And this wouldn\u2019t only apply to new releases. They could also rerelease\nall their older material at this higher price point.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to forget, but CDs were very expensive. According to a USA Today\nhistory of the format, when CDs were first marketed, they \u201ccost $16-$20 ...\nthe equivalent of $48-$60 today\u201d. That price point largely explains why\nindustry profits ballooned in the lead up to the year 2000. But it also\nexplains why they cratered right after.\n\nBoth legal and illegal digital music services of the 2000s (e.g., iTunes,\nNapster, LimeWire) unbundled the album. Now, if you wanted to get a copy of\n\u201cSmooth\u201d by Santana, you didn\u2019t need to go out and buy his star-studded album\nSupernatural. You could just get the single song for very cheap. Whether that\nwas good for musicians or not, listeners really liked this new level of choice\nafforded by music on the internet. As streaming came to dominate the industry,\nthis level of musical choice only became more pervasive.\n\nThis brief history raises some important questions. If consumers like the\nflexibility of online music, what has driven the vinyl revival of the last few\nyears? Furthermore, why have the Japanese people clung to their CDs and not\nmoved their listening to streaming as rapidly as the rest of the world?\n\n###\n\nWhy are Listeners Buying Vinyl?\n\nVinyl\u2019s resurgence in the last two decades has been nothing short of\nastounding. If you told someone in 1990 that teenagers would be buying vinyl\n30 years in the future, they wouldn\u2019t have believed you. But that\u2019s exactly\nwhat happened.\n\nI think there are a few factors that explain this resurgence. First, there is\nthis somewhat popular idea that vinyl not only has the best sound quality, but\nit\u2019s the correct way to listen to music. If you want to hear your favorite\nalbum as it is meant to be heard, you need to get it on vinyl. To be clear, I\ndon\u2019t think this is true. I think if you were looking at sound in some\nobjective sense, sound reproduced from vinyl would be laden with hiss, pops,\nand other imperfections. I think we just like the way these \u201cimperfections\u201d\nsound.\n\nSound quality aside, vinyl also provides things that other formats just don\u2019t.\nWith vinyl, you not only get a record, but you also get a big piece of\nartwork, along with liner notes, lyric sheets, posters, and other knick-\nknacks.\n\nA copy of Lorde\u2019s album Melodrama with lyrics, liner notes, and inserts\n\nIn this sense, vinyl is just a collectible that has very little to do with\nsound reproduction. This aligns with some data that has emerged in the last\nfew years. According to Luminate, only half of vinyl-purchasers actually own a\nrecord player. Furthermore, megastars are starting to release the same album\nwith different artwork variants. Fans are buying all of those variants even\nthough the music is the same. Still, this doesn\u2019t explain why CDs remain\ntremendously popular in Japan.\n\n###\n\nWhy are CDs so Popular in Japan?\n\nDespite the fact that Japan is the 11th most populated country on Earth, they\nhave been the second largest music market by revenue for a long time. You\ncould use this point to argue why the CD has remained so popular in Japan. The\nJapanese people love their music. Of course, they remain infatuated with the\ncompact disc, a format with high quality audio.\n\nThat\u2019s a nice theory. But it\u2019s incomplete. Though some of the Japanese CD\ninfatuation is driven by musical factors, demographic and economic factors are\nfar more important.\n\nFirst, Japan\u2019s population is old. As of 2021, the United Nations lists 29.8%\nof Japanese people as 65 or older, the highest percentage among any country\nwith a population of at least one million people. Other metrics tell the same\nstory. For example, in 2023, the CIA listed the median age of a person living\nin Japan as 49.5, the oldest on Earth among countries with a population of at\nleast one million people. Older people, more set in their ways, are more\nlikely to listen to music in antiquated formats.\n\nBut this can\u2019t tell the whole story. Compare Japan with Italy. Both countries\nhave some of the oldest populations on Earth, and those populations are\ngetting older. Their respective music listening couldn\u2019t be more different,\nthough. In 2023, 65% of Italian music revenues came from streaming. Only 14%\ncame from physical sales, more than half of which was from vinyl. In Japan, on\nthe other hand, 36% of revenues came from streaming. 55% came from physical\nsales, only 3% of which were vinyl. The large majority of that physical volume\nwas CDs. Why do these two aging populations listen to music so differently?\n\n  * Government Price Control: In 1953, Japan established its \u201cprice retail maintenance system,\u201d known as \u201csaihanbai kakaku iji seido\u201d or \u201csaihan seido.\u201d This allowed copyright owners, rather than retailers, to set a minimum price for copyrighted material that couldn\u2019t be lowered even if something was being resold. According to Billboard, the goal of this system was to ensure \u201ccopyrighted material\u2019s availability by reducing price competition among retail outlets.\u201d In reality, it led to inflated prices. These prices have created a strong incentive for Japanese record labels to maintain the status quo.\n\n  * Bundling: According to Reuters, CDs have remained so popular in Japan because \u201crecord labels often bundle CD singles and albums with perks ... including vouchers for priority concert ticket purchases and invitations to handshake events.\u201d These practices are not as common in other countries.\n\n  * Fan Culture: While pop star worship is common around the globe, it seems to be particularly potent throughout many Asian countries, including Japan. In fact, the Recording Industry Association of Japan notes in its FAQ that \u201cidol groups\u201d are some of the most popular on the archipelago. Fans of these groups are often willing to buy multiple copies of the same album and coordinate mass-purchase campaigns to push their favorite artists up the charts.\n\n  * Sony\u2019s Influence: Spotify was founded in Sweden in 2006. Thus, it\u2019s not shocking that the Swedes were some of the first users on the service. According to the IFPI, music streaming now represents 80% of Swedish music revenues. As noted earlier, Sony was one of the inventors of the CD. Part of the compact disc\u2019s long-term domination might be connected to the Japanese firm\u2019s power in its homeland.\n\nCan\u2019t Get Much Higher is here to keep you abreast of all the latest trends in\nthe music industry. Subscribe to get our newsletter sent to your inbox each\nweek.\n\nIn a 2014 New York Times exploration of the continued popularity of the CD in\nJapan, Universal Music Group CEO Lucian Grainge noted, \u201cJapan is utterly,\ntotally unique.\u201d A decade later, Grainge\u2019s characterization of the music\nlandscape on the Japanese archipelago remains accurate. But there are signs\nthat things are changing.\n\nDespite the fact that CDs still generate a ton of revenue in Japan, streaming\nis finally taking hold. In 2019, streaming only accounted for 17.5% of\nrecorded music revenue in Japan. In 2023, that percentage had increased to\n35.7%. And that\u2019s a good thing.\n\nAccording to the Recording Association Industry of Japan, industry revenues\nhave fallen almost unimpeded since 2005. This is because just like in the west\nin the early 2000s, music piracy is rampant. That\u2019s particularly crazy given\nthat pirating copyrighted material is a criminal offense in Japan that can\nresult in up to two years of jail time. Also like the west, the one thing that\nseems to be turning revenues around is the widespread adoption of streaming.\n\nOf course, I don\u2019t want every Japanese record shop to shut down. In fact, I\nthink it\u2019s really cool that you can still walk into a Tower Records in Japan.\nBut there are some practices around physical media that I think are wasteful.\nBillie Eilish recently espoused this belief in an interview with Billboard:\n\n> [I]t\u2019s some of the biggest artists in the world making fucking 40 different\n> vinyl packages that have a different unique thing just to get you to keep\n> buying more. It\u2019s so wasteful, and it\u2019s irritating to me that we\u2019re still at\n> a point where you care that much about your numbers and you care that much\n> about making money.\n\nOver the next decade, streaming will likely win out in Japan. If it doesn\u2019t,\nwe will see the United Kingdom or Germany overtake it as the world\u2019s second\nlargest music market. I do hope that the Japanese are able to maintain their\nlove for physical media as our world becomes more digital. I just hope that\nthat love can be maintained in a way that isn\u2019t as wasteful.\n\nA New One \"Time Paradox\" by Vaundy 2024 - Jaunty Pop\n\nWhile I was writing this newsletter, I thought it would be appropriate to\nlisten to some popular songs in Japan. So, I fired up Spotify\u2019s top songs in\nJapan chart and clicked play. The first song that struck me was this tune by\nVaundy, a tune whose title I believe translates to \u201cTime Paradox\u201d.\n\n\u201cTime Paradox\u201d was written for Doraemon the Movie: Nobita's Earth Symphony, a\nrecent film adaptation of the popular anime focused on the titular character.\nI have no idea what the movie is about. I also have no idea what the song is\nabout. But the light, jaunty melody has been banging around in my head for a\nfew days.\n\nAn Old One \"Sukiyaki\" by Kyu Sakamoto 1961 - Orchestral Pop\n\nOne of my favorite pointless facts is that in under 20 years after the end of\nWorld War II, artists from all three of the former Axis Powers had topped the\nAmerican pop chart, namely the Billboard Hot 100. First, it was the Italian\nDomenico Modugno crooning his song \u201cNel Blu Dipinto di Blu\u201d in 1958. Then it\nwas German Bert Kaempfert conducting his orchestra for the sleeping-walking\ninstrumental \u201cWonderland by Night\u201d in 1961. Finally, it was Japanese singer\nKyu Sakamoto on his wistful number \u201cSukiyaki\u201d two years later.\n\n\u201cSukiyaki\u201d has a strange history. Lyricist Rokusuke Ei wrote the song in\nresponse to the then-controversial U.S.-Japan Security Treaty under the title\n\u201cI Look Up When I Walk\u201d. An American record executive heard it and decided to\nrelease it stateside, albeit under \u201cSukiyaki\u201d, the name of a hot pot dish that\nhas nothing to do with the song. Nevertheless, the incorrectly-titled song was\na smash. Almost two decades later, new lyrics were written in English and it\nwas again a hit, this time for the group A Taste of Honey. It\u2019s continued\npopularity is proof that a great melody knows no borders.\n\nWant to hear the music that I make?
