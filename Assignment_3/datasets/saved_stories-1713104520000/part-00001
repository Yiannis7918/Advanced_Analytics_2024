But only now\nis the technology coming of age\n\nRobin McKie Science Editor\n\nShare\n\nTwenty years ago, scientists announced they had created a new miracle material\nthat was going to transform our lives. They called it graphene.\n\nConsisting of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal pattern,\nit is one of the strongest materials ever made and, for good measure, it is a\nbetter conductor of electricity and heat than copper.\n\nThe prospects for revolutionising technology seemed endless and a new\ngeneration of ultra-fast processors and computers was predicted. Reports said\nit could allow batteries to charge five times faster, and make concrete 35%\nstronger.\n\nIt was even put forward as the solution to potholes; just mix it with\ntraditional surfacing material and the curse of modern driving would be\neradicated, it was claimed.\n\nManchester University professors Andre Geim (left) and Konstantin Novoselov\ndiscovered graphene.

Graphene has\nyet to trigger an electronics revolution; potholes are still with us.\n\nSo what happened to the graphene revolution? Why has it not transformed our\nworld? Sir Colin Humphreys, professor of materials science at Queen Mary\nUniversity of London, has a straightforward answer: \u201cGraphene is still a very\npromising material. The problem has been scaling up its production. That is\nwhy it has not made the impact that was predicted.\u201d\n\nGraphene was originally made in a rather unusual manner, Humphreys explained.\nGeim and Novoselov created it by putting sticky tape on lumps of graphite and\npeeled away the layers until they got one that was the thickness of an atom.\n\n\u201cBut it would be just a tiny flake, a few millimetres across,\u201d he added. \u201cYou\ncannot make electronic devices with scraps like that. For functioning devices,\nyou have to have at least 6in wafers of material. So IBM, Samsung, and Intel\nbetween them spent billions trying to scale up graphene production to produce\nit in useful forms and quantities \u2013 with little success.\u201d\n\nAs a result, the graphene revolution was put on hold, although recently there\nhave been encouraging signs that the technology may soon regain much of its\noriginal promise.\n\nHumphreys believes the market could soon be re-energised thanks to\nbreakthroughs in the manufacture of graphene-based devices. A key development\nin this drive has been made by Humphreys and his colleagues, who realised the\ntechnology used to make gallium nitride electronic components could be\nexploited to make graphene on a large scale.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Observed\n\nFree weekly newsletter\n\nAnalysis and opinion on the week's news, culture and stories brought to you by\nthe best Observer writers\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

Two\nreactors \u2013 shaped like pizza ovens \u2013 are now producing enough graphene to make\n150,000 devices a day.\n\nThese are being used by Paragraf in two ways: first, to make sensors that\nmeasure magnetic fields. These can be used to detect malfunctioning batteries\nin e-bikes and e-scooters, preventing fires.\n\nThe second type of sensor can differentiate between bacterial and viral\ninfections, showing whether antibiotics would be an appropriate treatment. \u201cWe\nalso believe we could use our biosensors to detect whether or not someone has\nsepsis, in a few minutes,\u201d said Humphreys.\n\nThe fact that graphene devices are likely to consume less energy than current\ndevices is also important, he added.\n\n\u201cThe silicon age is coming to an end. We have reached the limit to the number\nof transistors that we can cram on a single chip while the energy they consume\nis doubling every three years.\n\n\u201cAnd that means if nothing happens, and we continue as we are doing, silicon\ndevices will consume all the world\u2019s generation of electricity \u2013 which is a\nhuge threat to our net zero aspirations.\n\n\u201cGraphene technology may have arrived later than we had originally hoped but\nit has the potential to get around these problems and make a real difference\nto modern life.\u201d\n\nGraphene \u2018has the potential to make a real difference to modern life\u2019, says\nprofessor of materials science Sir Colin Humphreys.
