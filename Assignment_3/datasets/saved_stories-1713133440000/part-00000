It\u2019s time for Congress\nto take a hard look at the IRS\u2019s hand in health care.\n\nThe agency uses a vague \u201ccommunity benefit\u201d standard to liberally grant tax-\nexempt status to so-called nonprofit hospitals even as many of them are\nfinancially taking advantage of sick Americans with inflated medical bills.\nSeveral of my Johns Hopkins colleagues and I published a study in the Journal\nof the American Medical Association showing that some nonprofit hospitals sue\nand garnish the wages of low-income patients who can\u2019t afford to pay their\nmedical bills. Where\u2019s the community benefit in that? Nonprofit hospitals are\nsupposed to be compassionate and merciful, not predatory and ruthless.\n\nadvertisement\n\nMany hospitals force people who are suffering and seeking care in earnest to\nsign their financial life away as a condition of treatment. Some make\ncontesting a bill difficult and others do not comply with the federal hospital\ntransparency rule which requires hospitals to post prices for common shoppable\nservices. The most recent money game that nonprofit hospitals are dialing up\nis adding billions of dollars in \u201cfacility fees\u201d for routine care. These\nbilling tricks are fleecing everyday Americans. Congress could make them\ndisappear overnight if it passed a law disqualifying hospitals that use them\nfrom getting the coveted tax-exempt benefit.\n\nMany tax-exempt hospitals argue that they provide millions of dollars in free\ncare. But here\u2019s what\u2019s really going on: Much of what they call free care is\nemergency care that hospitals are required to provide by law (the 1986\nEmergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act requires hospitals to care for\nanyone who walks in with an emergent condition). But after the care has been\nprovided, patients are often hounded for payment, often at an artificially\ninflated price. Hospitals then report the difference between their high\nsticker price and what they actually collect after shaking down a patient as\ncharity care.\n\nBut that\u2019s not charity. In a twist of irony, a 2021 study published in Health\nAffairs found that for-profit hospitals provided 65% more charity care than\nnonprofit ones.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe bar for receiving tax-exempt status should not be simply abiding by the\nlaw.\n\n## Related: HCA reports almost $1 billion more in charity care to Medicare\nthan to its shareholders, drawing more taxpayer money\n\nHospitals leaders across the nation have told me that they need to avoid\nfederal taxes in order to survive. But the way taxes work, businesses are\ntaxed only on their profits. Some hospitals hide their profits in cost-shift\naccounting and loan refinancing, even engaging in aggressive real estate and\nventure capital investing. According to public tax records, Cedars Sinai in\nBeverly Hills had an income surplus of $750 million in 2022 and paid no\nfederal taxes. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York had $400\nmillion and also paid no federal taxes. The top three hospital administrators\nthere made nearly $20 million in salaries.\n\nTry booking an appointment at these or any nonprofit hospital and see if you\ncan do it without insurance or cash up front. It\u2019s nearly impossible. Most\nnonprofit hospitals will refuse to schedule appointments, even cancer care,\nunless you financially qualify by showing your ability to pay.\n\nIf hospitals schedule appointments and operations only for people who\nfinancially qualify, arguing that they are a business, they should pay their\nfair share of taxes like every other American business. A Kaiser Family\nFoundation study estimated the total value of tax exemptions for nonprofit\nhospitals was $28 billion in 2020 alone. By my calculation, that\u2019s equivalent\nto a $107 tax credit for every American who filed a return that year.\n\nMomentum to stop this gaming of the system is growing. In August, a bipartisan\ngroup of U.S. senators including Bill Cassidy and Elizabeth Warren demanded\nmore transparency from the IRS on the issue after a General Accountability\nOffice report found that the agency \u201cdid not have a well-documented process\u201d\nto ensure that hospitals met tax-exempt criteria.\n\nUPCOMING EVENT\n\n## Connect with today's innovators & tomorrow's thought leaders\n\nWe're hosting events nationwide (and virtually) to tackle the biggest\nquestions in health and medicine. Browse our upcoming events to see what's on\nthe horizon.\n\nIn October, Bernie Sanders, the chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor\nand Pensions committee stressed the need to address the problem. \u201cMany\nnonprofit hospital systems across the country are failing to provide low-\nincome Americans with the affordable medical care required by their nonprofit\nstatus \u2014 despite receiving billions in tax benefits and providing exorbitant\ncompensation packages to their senior executives,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nIn another sign that government officials are getting fed up with hospitals\npaying no taxes, in 2023 a Pennsylvania judge revoked a hospital\u2019s property\ntax exemption. This action came after the Pottstown school district sued the\nhospital, arguing that its special tax treatment resulted in $900,000 less\nrevenue for the school each year.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the IRS\u2019s lackadaisical approach to hospitals that\u2019s mind-\nboggling. It\u2019s also the agency\u2019s hostility to direct primary care and other\ncreative strategies developed by doctors to address chronic diseases. The IRS\ndoes not allow individuals or families who subscribe to direct primary care \u2014\na type of intensive primary care that takes extra time to focus on prevention\n\u2014 to include that cost as a tax-deductible health savings account expense. A\n2019 White House executive order challenged this position to no avail. Last\nmonth, the IRS sternly warned Americans that they cannot use their own health\nsavings account to buy healthy foods as directed by their doctors.\n\nThe IRS continues to propagate a reactionary approach to sickness rather than\na proactive approach to health. Chronic diseases are the leading cause of\ndeath in the U.S. and consume a majority of the $4.5 trillion Americans spend\non health care. The current Whac-a-Mole system isn\u2019t working. Most American\nadults take 4 or more prescription medications regularly, making the U.S. the\nmost medicated population in the world. The country needs to try new\napproaches to health.\n\nInstead of scolding Americans who sign up for direct primary care or want to\neat healthier foods, the IRS should hold hospitals accountable for the taxes\nthey should be paying.\n\nMarty Makary, M.D., M.P.H., is a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of\nMedicine and Carey Business School and author of the forthcoming book \u201cBlind\nSpots: When medicine gets it wrong and what it means for our health\u201d\n(Bloomsbury Press, Sept. 2024).\n\n## LETTER TO THE EDITOR\n\n#### Have an opinion on this essay?
