The relentless march of\nthe railroad brought with it a wave of new towns, bustling trains, and\ninterconnected telegraph lines, heralding an era of rapid change.\n\nThis transformation spelled trouble for the bison, as European settlers,\nspurred by profit, decimated the once-plentiful herds.\n\nBy the 1880s, their numbers had plummeted from around 30 million to a mere\n325, marking a catastrophic decline.\n\nA man stands in front of a huge pile of bison skulls.\n\nBefore horses were introduced, Native American hunters used innovative methods\nto hunt bison.\n\nThey would guide the animals into large chutes made of rocks and willow\nbranches, then trap them in a corral known as a buffalo pound.\n\nOnce contained, the bison were either slaughtered on the spot or driven over\ncliffs in a practice called buffalo jumps.\n\nArchaeological sites containing both pounds and jumps can be found in various\nlocations across the U.S. and Canada.\n\nThe arrival of horses, originally brought by the Spanish, revolutionized\nhunting techniques. By the early 1700s, horses had become integral to the\nnomadic hunting cultures of Indigenous groups.\n\nThis advancement allowed tribes, once confined to the eastern regions, to move\nwestward in pursuit of the larger bison populations found on the Great Plains.\n\nThese \u201cbuffalo runners\u201d could kill up to 5,000 bison per day.\n\nThe horse was the missing tool that made it possible for Native Americans to\nbegin a systematic exploitation of the enormous resource of protein, fat, and\nhides that was stored in the bodies of an estimated 30 million bison in the\nPlains.\n\nOn horseback, hunters could follow the migrating herds more closely and over a\nwider range, kill the animals more efficiently, and carry back more meat and\nhides.\n\nAttracted by previously unimagined hunting possibilities, Native Americans\npoured into the Plains from all directions, creating one of most renowned\nhunting cultures in history.\n\nMen standing with piles of buffalo skulls, Michigan Carbon Works, Rougeville\nMich., 1892.\n\nBy the early 19th century, Plains Native Americans had perfected a range of\nhorseback bison-hunting methods tailored to the region\u2019s seasons and\nlandscapes.\n\nIn winter, they guided bison into snow-filled gulches or drifts, while summer\nhunts led them to swamps, rivers, or makeshift corrals.\n\nIn the Northern Plains, where horses were scarce, many tribes relied on\ntraditional methods like the foot surround.\n\nA taxidermist shop displays bison heads.\n\nTo control bison movements, Plains tribes often burned sections of grasslands.\nYet, the most popular technique was the mounted chase.\n\nHere, hunters galloped after bison on swift horses, using lances or arrows to\nstrike their prey.\n\nDespite the availability of muskets, hunters preferred the short bow for its\nease of use on horseback and the scarcity of gunpowder and shot, which were\ntypically saved for warfare.\n\nLaw men pose with bison heads confiscated by poachers. Date unknown.\n\nIt was during this period that most Plains Native Americans developed a\nsingular dependency on the buffalo.\n\nThe western Plains became the domain of highly specialized hunter-nomads who\nfed, clothed, sheltered, and decorated themselves from the skin, flesh, fat,\nand bones of the bison.\n\nWhat they could not get by hunting, they acquired by trading surplus hides,\ndried meat, pemmican, and other products of the hunt.\n\nSuch reliance on a narrow ecological base ultimately proved unsustainable,\npushing the bison populations into a steep decline by the mid\u201319th century.\n\nThe traditional hunting culture of Plains Native Americans met its demise in\nthe 1870s and 1880s, as commercial European-American hunters nearly\nexterminated the bison.\n\nA man holds a rifle on top of a dead bison in an 1897 print titled \u201cGlory\nenough for one day\u2019s hunt.\u201d\n\nIn contrast to Indigenous practices, where hunters harvested only what was\nnecessary and utilized every part of the animal, European settlers engaged in\nmass hunting for the skins and tongues of bison, leaving the rest of the\ncarcass to waste away.\n\nAs the animals decomposed, their bones were gathered and transported in large\nquantities back east. The roaming nature of bison made them easy targets for\nEuropean hunters.\n\nWhen one bison in a herd is killed, the other bison gather around it.\n\nDue to this pattern, the ability of a hunter to kill one bison often led to\nthe destruction of a large herd of them.\n\nBuffalo hunting, Yellowstone Park, from Robert N. Dennis collection of\nstereoscopic views, 1900s.\n\nIn 1889, an essay in a journal of the time observed:\n\nThirty years ago millions of the great unwieldy animals existed on this\ncontinent. Innumerable droves roamed, comparatively undisturbed and unmolested\n...\n\nMany thousands have been ruthlessly and shamefully slain every season for past\ntwenty years or more by white hunters and tourists merely for their robes, and\nin sheer wanton sport, and their huge carcasses left to fester and rot, and\ntheir bleached skeletons to strew the deserts and lonely plains.\n\nA buffalo hunt in 1869, Kansas.\n\nFor settlers in the Plains region, bison hunting became a key economic\nactivity.\n\nTrappers and traders earned their livelihoods by selling buffalo fur; during\nthe winter of 1872\u20131873 alone, over 1.5 million buffalo were shipped by train\nto the east.\n\nApart from the profits derived from buffalo leather, which was commonly used\nfor machinery belts and army boots, the rise of buffalo hunting also led\nNative Americans to rely more on beef from cattle.\n\nA postcard featuring a killed buffalo. It reads: \u201cKilling cows and spikes.\u201d\n\nCommercial bison hunting became increasingly prevalent during this period.\nMany military forts supported hunters, who often had civilian connections near\ntheir base.\n\nWhile officers hunted bison for both sustenance and sport, it was the\nprofessional hunters who had a significant impact on the decline of the bison\npopulation.\n\nFort Hays and Wallace even saw competitions like the \u201cbuffalo shooting\nchampionship of the world,\u201d featuring figures such as \u201cMedicine Bill\u201d Comstock\nand \u201cBuffalo Bill\u201d Cody.\n\nA pile of bison skulls following a hunt in Wyoming, 1870.\n\nThe US Army sanctioned and actively endorsed the wholesale slaughter of bison\nherds.\n\nThe federal government promoted bison hunting for various reasons, primarily\nto pressure the native people onto the Indian reservations during times of\nconflict by removing their main food source.\n\nWithout the bison, native people of the plains were often forced to leave the\nland or starve to death. One of the biggest advocates of this strategy was\nGeneral William Tecumseh Sherman.\n\nOn June 26, 1869, the Army Navy Journal reported: \u201cGeneral Sherman remarked,\nin conversation the other day, that the quickest way to compel the Indians to\nsettle down to civilized life was to send ten regiments of soldiers to the\nplains, with orders to shoot buffaloes until they became too scarce to support\nthe redskins.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrail of the hide hunters.\u201d Buffalo lying dead in snow, 1872.\n\nFinnish historian Pekka H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen suggests that certain Native American\ntribes also played a role in the decline of the bison in the southern Plains.\n\nBy the 1830s, the Comanche and their allies were hunting around 280,000 bison\nannually, pushing the region\u2019s sustainability limit.\n\nThe introduction of firearms and horses, alongside a growing demand for\nbuffalo robes and meat, led to an escalating number of bison being killed each\nyear.\n\nA prolonged and intense drought hit the southern plains in 1845, lasting into\nthe 1860s, causing a widespread collapse of the bison herds.\n\nHowever, by the 1860s, the rains returned, and the bison herds began to\nrecover to some extent.\n\nHunters skinning the buffalo to make money from their pelts.\n\nOld West bison hunting was very often a big commercial enterprise, involving\norganized teams of one or two professional hunters, backed by a team of\nskinners, gun cleaners, cartridge reloaders, cooks, wranglers, blacksmiths,\nsecurity guards, teamsters, and numerous horses and wagons.\n\nMen were even employed to recover and recast lead bullets taken from the\ncarcasses.\n\nBuffalo hunting in Montana, date unspecified.\n\nMany of these professional hunters, such as Buffalo Bill Cody, killed over a\nhundred animals at a single stand and many thousands in their careers.\n\nOne professional hunter killed over 20,000 by his count. The average prices\npaid the buffalo hunters from 1880 to 1884 were as follows.\n\nFor cow hides, $3; bull hides, $2.50; yearlings, $1.50; calves, $0.75 cents;\nand the cost of getting the hides to market brought the cost up to about $3.50\n($89.68 accounting for inflation) per hide.\n\nA pile of bison bones next to train tracks. As new railroad lines extended\nacross the country, settlers poured west into land long held by Native\nAmericans.\n\nFor a decade after 1873, there were several hundred, perhaps over a thousand,\nsuch commercial hide-hunting outfits harvesting bison at any one time, vastly\nexceeding the take by Native Americans or individual meat hunters.\n\nThe commercial take arguably was anywhere from 2,000 to 100,000 animals per\nday depending on the season, though there are no statistics available.\n\n\u201cRath & Wright\u2019s buffalo hide yard in 1878, showing 40,000 buffalo hides,\nDodge City, Kansas.\u201d\n\nDue to the mass slaughter of bison during the 1870s, the plains bison\npopulation underwent a population bottleneck.\n\nThe population plummeted from an estimated 60 million individuals, as observed\nby Colonel R.I. Dodge along the Arkansas River in Kansas in 1871, to a\nfounding population of around 100 individuals.\n\nThese survivors were divided into six herds, with five managed by private\nranchers and one by the New York Zoological Park (now the Bronx Zoo).\n\nAdditionally, a wild herd of 25 individuals in Yellowstone National Park\nsurvived the bottleneck.\n\nBison hunters in Montana, 1882.\n\nFrom the late 19th century onwards, the bison population gradually rose from\n325 in 1884 to 500,000 in 2017, as a result of careful preservation and a\ngeneral population boom.\n\nAlthough they are no longer classified as endangered, there are still\nconservation efforts in order to prevent population crashes down the line.\n\nOnce numbering as many as 60 million, only a few hundred bison remained in the\nwild at the turn of the century.

Sherman\nexpressed frustration in letters about resistance from Native Americans. He\ncontroversially proposed a large-scale \u201chunt\u201d of the bison as a means to\npressure Native Americans into relocating to reservations.\n\nPhilip Sheridan, who allegedly once said that the \u201cThe only good Indians I\never saw were dead\u201d endorsed the hunting of the bison. Of buffalo hunters he\nsaid: \u201cThese men have done more in the last two years, and will do more in the\nnext year, to settle the vexed Indian question, than the entire regular army\nhas done in the last forty years.\u201d\n\nThe Crow Indian Buffalo Hunt diorama at the Milwaukee Public Museum.\n\nIllustration of Indians hunting the bison by Karl Bodmer.\n\nNumerous Native American tribes depended extensively on bison. The animals\nprovided essential resources such as food, shelter, and clothing, and were\nalso revered in spiritual contexts.\n\nMen like \u201cBuffalo\u201d Bill Cody made a career out of killing bison, slaughtering\n4,000 in two years. But even that wasn\u2019t enough to make a dent in their\npopulation.\n\n(Photo credit: Library of Congress / Wikimedia Commons).\n\nUpdated on: April 5, 2024\n\nAny factual error or typo?
