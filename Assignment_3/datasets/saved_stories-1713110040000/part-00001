This is helpful feedback in clarifying the expectations of the Ballot, and we\u2019ve responded to them directly on GitHub [1]. We also staged [2] these updates in and a separate branch [3] to avoid any confusion with the in-progress discussion period. Feedback on these proposed updates are welcome. The new branch will serve as the basis for a subsequent round of Public Discussion once this one closes.

certificates, which led to the > impersonation of HTTPS websites [3][4]. > - Routing security defenses (e.g., RPKI) can mitigate the risk of global > BGP attacks, but localized, equally-specific BGP attacks still pose a > significant threat to the Web PKI [5][6]. > - Corroborating domain control validation checks from multiple network > perspectives (i.e., MPIC) spread across the Internet substantially reduces > the threat posed by equally-specific BGP attacks, ensuring the integrity of > domain validation and issuance decisions [5][7][8]. > - Existing deployments of MPIC at the scale of millions of certificates a > day demonstrate the feasibility of this technique at Internet scale [7][9]. > > > > *Intellectual Property (IP) Disclosure*: > > > > - While not a Server Certificate Working Group Member, researchers from > Princeton University presented at Face-to-Face 58, provided academic > expertise, and highlighted publicly-available peer-reviewed research to > support Members in drafting this ballot. > - The Princeton University researchers indicate that they have not filed > for any patents relating to their MPIC work and do not plan to do so in the > future. > - Princeton University has indicated that it is unable to agree to the > CA/Browser Forum IPR agreement because it could encumber inventions > invented by researchers not involved in the development of
