As we share, communicate, and store an increasing amount of\nsensitive information online, the need to safeguard it from prying eyes and\nmalicious actors becomes paramount. Encryption serves as the digital guardian,\nplacing our data in a lockbox of algorithms that only those with the proper\nkey can unlock.\n\nWhether it\u2019s personal messages, health data, financial transactions, or\nconfidential business communications, encryption plays a pivotal role in\nmaintaining privacy and ensuring the integrity of our digital interactions.\nTypically, data encryption protects data in transit: it\u2019s locked in an\nencrypted \u201ccontainer\u201d for transit over potentially unsecured networks, then\nunlocked at the other end, by the other party for analysis. But outsourcing to\na third-party is inherently insecure.\n\nBrandon Reagen, Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering and\nElectrical and Computer Engineering at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering.\n\nNYU Tandon School of Engineering\n\nBut what if encryption didn\u2019t just exist in transit and sit unprotected on\neither end of the transmission? What if it was possible to do all of your\ncomputer work \u2014 from basic apps to complicated algorithms \u2014 fully encrypted,\nfrom beginning to end.\n\nThat is the task being taken up by Brandon Reagen, Assistant Professor of\nComputer Science and Engineering and Electrical and Computer Engineering at\nthe NYU Tandon School of Engineering. Reagen, who is also a member of the NYU\nCenter for Cybersecurity, focuses his research on designing specialized\nhardware accelerators for applications including privacy preserving\ncomputation. And now, he is proving that the future of computing can be\nprivacy-forward while making huge advances in information processing and\nhardware design.\n\n## All-encompassing Encryption\n\nIn a world where cyber threats are ever-evolving and data breaches are a\nconstant concern, encrypted data acts as a shield against unauthorized access,\nidentity theft, and other cybercrimes. It provides individuals, businesses,\nand organizations with a secure foundation upon which they can build trust and\nconfidence in the digital realm.\n\nThe goal of cybersecurity researchers is the protection of your data from all\nsorts of bad actors \u2014 cybercriminals, data-hungry companies, and authoritarian\ngovernments. And Reagen believes encrypted computing could hold an answer.\n\u201cThis sort of encryption can give you three major things: improved security,\ncomplete confidentiality and sometimes control over how your data is used,\u201d\nsays Reagen. \u201cIt\u2019s a totally new level of privacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy aim is to develop ways to run expensive applications, for example, massive\nneural networks, cost-effectively and efficiently, anywhere, from massive\nservers to smartphones\u201d \u2014Brandon Reagen, NYU Tandon\n\nFully homomorphic encryption (FHE), one type of privacy preserving\ncomputation, offers a solution to this challenge. FHE enables computation on\nencrypted data, or ciphertext, to keep data protected at all times. The\nbenefits of FHE are significant, from enabling the use of untrusted networks\nto enhancing data privacy. FHE is an advanced cryptographic technique, widely\nconsidered the \u201choly grail of encryption,\u201d that enables users to process\nencrypted data while the data or models remain encrypted, preserving data\nprivacy throughout the data computation process, not just during transit.\n\nWhile a number of FHE solutions have been developed, running FHE in software\non standard processing hardware remains untenable for practical data security\napplications due to the massive processing overhead. Reagen and his colleagues\nhave recently been working on a DARPA-funded project called The Data\nProtection in Virtual Environments (DPRIVE) program, that seeks to speed up\nFHE computation to more usable levels.\n\nThe microarchitecture of Reagen\u2019s designed Ring Processing Unit (RPU), one of\nseveral designs to remake cybersecurity in computing. The RPU was designed for\ngeneral ring processing with high performance by taking advantage of\nregularity and data parallelism.\n\nNYU Tandon School of Engineering\n\nSpecifically, the program seeks to develop novel approaches to data movement\nand management, parallel processing, custom functional units, compiler\ntechnology, and formal verification methods that ensure the design of the FHE\nimplementation is effective and accurate, while also dramatically decreasing\nthe performance penalty incurred by FHE computations. The target accelerator\nshould reduce the computational run time overhead by many orders of magnitude\ncompared to current software-based FHE computations on conventional CPUs, and\naccelerate FHE calculations to within one order of magnitude of current\nperformance on unencrypted data.\n\n## The Hardware Promising Privacy\n\nWhile FHE has been shown to be possible, the hardware required for it to be\npractical is still rapidly being developed by researchers. Reagen and his team\nare designing it from the ground up, including new chips, datapaths, memory\nhierarchies, and software stacks to make it all work together.\n\nThe team was the first to show that the extreme levels of speedup needed to\nmake HE feasible was possible. And by early next year, they\u2019ll begin\nmanufacturing of their prototypes to further their field testing.\n\nReagen \u2014 who earned a doctoral degree in computer science from Harvard in 2018\nand undergraduate degrees in computer systems engineering and applied\nmathematics from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, in 2012 \u2014 focused\non creating specialized hardware accelerators for applications like deep\nlearning. These accelerators enhance specialized hardware that can be made\norders of magnitude more efficient than general-purpose platforms like CPUs.\nEnabling accelerators requires changes to the entire compute stack, and to\nbring about this change, he has made several contributions to lowering the\nbarrier of using accelerators as general architectural constructs, including\nbenchmarking, simulation infrastructure, and System on a Chip (SoC) design.\n\nCheetah accelerator architecture, an earlier project from Reagen. (a) The\naccelerator is composed of parallel PEs operating in output stationary\nfashion. Off-chip data is communicated via a PCIe-like streaming interface,\nand data is buffered on-chip using global PE SRAM. (b) Each PE contains\nPartial Processing Lanes which compute the HE dot product. (c) Lanes comprise\nindividual HE operators.\n\nNYU Tandon School of Engineering\n\n\u201cMy aim is to develop ways to run expensive applications, for example, massive\nneural networks, cost-effectively and efficiently, anywhere, from massive\nservers to smartphones,\u201d he says.\n\nBefore coming to NYU Tandon, Reagen was a former research scientist on\nFacebook\u2019s AI Infrastructure Research team, where he became deeply involved in\nstudying privacy. This combination of a deep cutting-edge computer hardware\nbackground and a commitment to digital security made him a perfect fit for NYU\nTandon and the NYU Center for Cybersecurity, which has been at the forefront\nof cybersecurity research since its inception.\n\n\u201cA lot of the big problems that we have in the world right now revolve around\ndata. Consider global health coming off of COVID: if we had better ways of\ncomputing global health data analytics and sharing information without\nexposing private data, we might have been able to respond to the crisis more\neffectively and sooner\u201d \u2014Brandon Reagen, NYU Tandon\n\nFor Reagen, this is an exciting moment in the history of privacy preserving\ncomputation, a field that will have huge implications for the future of data\nand computing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an optimist \u2014 I think this could have as big an impact as the Internet\nitself,\u201d says Reagen. \u201cAnd the reason is that, if you think about a lot of the\nbig problems that we have in the world right now, a lot of them revolve around\ndata. Consider global health. We\u2019re just coming off of COVID, and if we had\nbetter ways of computing global health data analytics and sharing information\nwithout exposing private data, we might have been able to respond to the\ncrisis more effectively and sooner. If we had better ways of sharing data\nabout climate change data from all over the world, without exposing what each\nindividual country or state or city was actually emitting, you could imagine\nbetter ways of managing and fighting global climate change. These problems\nare, in large part, problems of data, and this kind of software can help us\nsolve them.\u201d\n\nFrom Your Site Articles\n\n  * IBM Makes Encryption Paradox Practical \u203a\n  * How to Compute With Data You Can\u2019t See \u203a\n  * Homomorphic Encryption - IEEE Spectrum \u203a\n  * Stop Trusting Your Cloud Provider - IEEE Spectrum \u203a\n  * Chips to Compute With Encrypted Data Are Coming - IEEE Spectrum \u203a\n\nRelated Articles Around the Web\n\n  * Home - NYU Center for Cyber Security \u203a\n  * Brandon Reagen | NYU Tandon School of Engineering \u203a\n  * Homomorphic encryption - Wikipedia \u203a\n\nencryptionsecuritynyu tandonprivacycybersecurity\n\nNYU Tandon School of Engineering\n\nThe NYU Tandon School of Engineering is the engineering and applied sciences\nschool of New York University.\n\nThe Conversation (0)\n\nSort by\n\nThe InstituteHistory of TechnologyIEEE HistoryArticle\n\n## 50 Years Later, This Apollo-Era Antenna Still Talks to Voyager 2\n\n17 hours ago\n\n5 min read\n\n1\n\nBiomedicalNews\n\n## This Blood-Sampling Cytometer Is Small Enough for Mars\n\n20 hours ago\n\n4 min read\n\nBiomedicalNewsJournal Watch\n\n## Tiny Sensor Aims to Monitor Tumors in Real Time\n\n21 hours ago\n\n3 min read\n\n## Related Stories\n\nComputingNewsConsumer ElectronicsTelecommunications\n\n## Meta\u2019s Global Encryption Rollout Ups Privacy Stakes\n\nSemiconductorsMagazineFeatureTop Tech 2024ComputingSpecial ReportsJanuary\n2024Telecommunications\n\n## Chips to Compute With Encrypted Data Are Coming\n\nHistory of TechnologyMagazineSeptember 2021Feature\n\n## The Scandalous History of the Last Rotor Cipher Machine\n\n", "frontpage": false}
