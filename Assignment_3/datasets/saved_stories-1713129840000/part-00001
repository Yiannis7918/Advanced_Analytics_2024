(David Paul\nMorris/Bloomberg)\n\nBy Bloomberg | wordpress@medianewsgroup.com\n\nPUBLISHED: April 4, 2024 at 9:40 a.m. | UPDATED: April 4, 2024 at 10:12 a.m.\n\nBy Todd Woody\n\nAs California\u2019s longtime chief climate regulator, Mary Nichols once championed\nhydrogen fuel cell cars. Just a few years ago, as the state spent tens of\nmillions of dollars on a planned network of fueling stations dubbed \u201cthe\nhydrogen highway,\u201d Nichols was extolling the 300-mile (range and quick\nrefueling time of her own hydrogen ride, a futuristic Toyota Mirai.\n\nToday, though, Nichols drives a battery-electric Ford Mustang Mach-E. It too\noffers 300 miles of range. \u201cI would have no problem driving a hydrogen car\nagain but I don\u2019t know that I would feel like I had to,\u201d says Nichols, who\nserved multiple terms as chair of the California Air Resources Board before\nstepping down in 2020. \u201cRight now, I don\u2019t think it would be a good bet to\nassume that there\u2019s going to be a big shift to hydrogen vehicles except for\nheavy-duty trucks, where being able to move a lot of weight is important.\u201d\n\nDespite billions of dollars of investment, fuel cell cars in the US are\ndisappearing in the rearview mirror, overtaken by battery-electric models and\nstalled by hydrogen shortages and soaring fuel prices. Last year, drivers\nbought just 3,143 hydrogen cars in California \u2014 the only state that sells them\n\u2014 compared with 380,000 battery-electric vehicles (or BEVs).\n\nHYDROGEN CARS: Despite few buyers, California may pay $300M for fuel stations\n\nHydrogen\u2019s proponents aren\u2019t throwing in the towel. Toyota and Hyundai are\npushing fuel cell models, albeit at heavy discounts, and Honda just announced\na hydrogen hybrid version of its best-selling CR-V. California continues to\nbuild new infrastructure. But for drivers and would-be car buyers, the\npractical experience of going hydrogen-electric is bad and getting worse.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear what technology has won in the marketplace,\u201d says David Reichmuth,\na senior engineer with the Union of Concerned Scientists\u2019 clean transportation\nprogram. \u201cIf we want to go as fast as possible to decarbonize, then the plug-\nin electric vehicle is clearly the technology with the infrastructure\navailable to do that now.\u201d\n\nFuel cells work by converting compressed hydrogen gas in an onboard tank into\nelectricity that powers the vehicle\u2019s motor. Carmakers started developing them\nin the 1990s after California passed a zero-emissions vehicle mandate to fight\nsmog. Those efforts accelerated in the wake of the state\u2019s landmark 2006\nclimate law, which ordered a sharp drop in greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nHYDROGEN NICHE? California phases out new diesel trucks by end of 2035\n\nThe first hydrogen car efforts were bespoke \u2014 in 2006, I drove a prototype of\na hand-built Mercedes fuel cell car that cost $1 million. Then in 2013,\nCalifornia enacted legislation allocating $20 million a year to finance 100\nhydrogen stations. Soon Honda, Hyundai and Toyota started selling or leasing\nhydrogen cars in the only state that offered the ability to fuel them.\n\nIn 2018, Governor Jerry Brown set a target of 200 hydrogen stations by 2025, a\ngoal to which the state has committed nearly $257 million. But last year Shell\nPlc quietly declined a $41 million state grant to build 50 stations, and\nCalifornia scaled back its target to 130 stations by 2027. In February, Shell\nshuttered six of its seven retail hydrogen stations in the state. A total of\n66 stations remain, but 12 have been offline for more than 30 days and others\nsporadically shut down due to supply shortages or equipment problems.\n\nHYDROGEN BUS: First hydrogen-powered transit bus in LA County hits streets in\nDecember, starting new trend\n\nBy contrast, California boasts just over 105,000 charging stations for plug-in\nvehicles. Battery-electric models accounted for 21% of new car sales in the\nstate last year and Tesla\u2019s Model Y and Model 3 were California\u2019s top two\nbest-selling vehicles.\n\nEven for functional hydrogen fuel stations, downtime is routine. On April 2,\nfor instance, 16 of the state\u2019s 54 stations in operation were closed,\naccording to real-time data from the Hydrogen Fuel Cell Partnership. Southern\nCalifornia, hit particularly hard by the Shell closures, sees about half of\nits stations go offline on any given day.\n\nIn Northern California, drivers in affluent Marin County rely on a single fuel\nstation, which on one afternoon in late March had only enough hydrogen to fill\nup a few cars. (Three days later, it went offline due to \u201cmechanical issues.\u201d)\nOn the other side of San Francisco Bay, Shell\u2019s exit cost Berkeley, where fuel\ncell car sightings aren\u2019t uncommon, its sole open station.\n\nBIG RIG: This hydrogen-fueled 18-wheeler at L.A., Long Beach ports emits only\nwater from tailpipe\n\nAcross the state, the closures and downtime are leaving drivers scrambling to\nfind fuel. On Reddit, one Mirai owner posted that their car had been towed\ntwice recently after running out of fuel, as every hydrogen station within 25\nmiles had gone offline. A Sacramento-area tow truck driver chimed in that they\ntow several marooned hydrogen cars a month to the only fueling station still\nopen in the state capital region.\n\nComplaints about fuel prices are just as common. Filling up a Mirai, a Hyundai\nNexo or a Honda FCX Clarity runs a California driver about $200 \u2014 the\nequivalent of paying $14.60 for a gallon of gas.\n\n\u201cThe car is AMAZING but the fueling infrastructure and cost of hydrogen per\nmile is TERRIBLE,\u201d wrote one Mirai owner on Facebook. On Reddit, a hydrogen\nfuel cell car owner in Southern California vented that, \u201cThe cost is the\nequivalent of driving a monster truck that gets 9 mpg.\u201d\n\nThe sky-high fuel prices are discouraging even hardcore hydrogen enthusiasts\nlike Tina Imahara. A documentary film editor in Southern California, Imahara\nbought her first fuel cell car, a 2017 Mirai, after working on environment-\nthemed movies. \u201cThe car itself is incredible,\u201d she says. \u201cI lived 84 miles\nfrom my closest station when I first got my first one, so I really had to\nplan. There were some close calls when I was running on fumes.\u201d\n\nBy the time Imahara upgraded to a 2021 Mirai \u2014 which came with a $15,000 fuel\ncard \u2014 the number of stations had grown and she now lives close to one. But as\nhydrogen fuel prices soared last year, she reluctantly traded the Mirai for a\nbattery-electric Toyota bZ4X SUV.\n\n\u201cWe went right through our card,\u201d she says. \u201cHydrogen was double the price of\ngas and we weren\u2019t going to go back to gas.\u201d\n\nIn February, Shell closed its seven retail hydrogen stations in California \u2014\nincluding the only station serving the Berkeley area. (Tim Rue/Bloomberg)\n\nJust a decade ago, hydrogen cars\u2019 future looked brighter. In 2014, I visited\nHonda\u2019s North America headquarters in the Los Angeles suburb of Torrance to\ntake a spin in the carmaker\u2019s 2013 FCX Clarity. The sedan could travel 240\nmiles on a tank of H2, an impressive distance for an EV at a time when most\nbattery-electric models had 80 miles of range. I stopped by a Shell hydrogen\nstation near Honda\u2019s corporate campus, where it took only a few minutes to\nfill the Clarity\u2019s tank. It seemed like a game-changer.\n\nWhen I returned to Torrance last month, the game had indeed changed: Honda\ndiscontinued the Clarity in 2021. I was there for a preview of the 2025 Honda\nCR-V e:FCEV, a battery-electric hydrogen hybrid version of the company\u2019s CR-V\ncompact SUV. The e:FCEV has a range of 270 miles and can run on battery power\nfor 29 of them, mitigating the volatility of the hydrogen market and the\nunreliability of fueling stations. Honda\u2019s pitch is essentially: Do most of\nyour daily driving on battery power, charge at home, and save trips to a\nhydrogen station for longer journeys.\n\nHonda has sold nearly 6 million internal-combustion CR-Vs in the US, and the\ne:FCEV I drove around LA wouldn\u2019t look out of place in any suburban driveway.\nThe ride is as quiet and smooth as EV drivers have come to expect. But the\nspecs are nothing special: My Uber from the airport, a Tesla Model 3, had more\nthan 300 miles of range. Honda anticipates leasing just 300 hydrogen CR-V\u2019s a\nyear to start, only in California and for a price to be announced later.\n\nOther carmakers are also hedging their bets with hydrogen. Hyundai sells the\nNexo SUV, which debuted in the US in late 2018 and now boasts up to 380 miles\nof range. But the carmaker moved only a few hundred of them in California last\nyear. Hyundai declined to make an executive available to discuss its hydrogen\nstrategy.\n\nToyota, which has placed a major bet on hybrid cars, also remains committed to\nhydrogen. Since introducing the Mirai in 2015, the carmaker has sold more than\n14,000 of them in California; the most recent models get up to 400 miles per\ntank.\n\n\u201cWe not only see fuel cells as great for the light vehicle, but we also see it\nas an option for heavy-duty vehicles and we also see it as a great option for\nelectrical generation,\u201d says Tim Bliss, general manager of Toyota vehicle\nmarketing in North America.\n\nHonda, too, says its fuel cell car is about creating demand for hydrogen, as a\nsource of backup power and for difficult-to-electrify transportation such as\ntrains, planes and heavy-duty trucks. \u201cFor us it\u2019s a long-term play to not\njust grow light vehicles, but to grow the overall hydrogen economy, and light\nvehicles are an essential part of that,\u201d says Jay Joseph, vice president for\nsustainability and business development at American Honda Motor Co.\n\nBut deep discounts on fuel cell cars tell a different demand story. In March,\nToyota offered up to $40,000 cash back on a new $49,500 2023 Mirai Limited, a\nlower-range model, plus 0% financing. (Bliss says this inventory adjustment\napplied to a small number of cars.) Over at a Hyundai dealership, you could\npick up a new $63,585 Nexo for $28,585 and pay no interest. At one San\nFrancisco Toyota dealership, a used 2020 Mirai could be had for about $12,000.\n\nCalifornia has no plans to walk away from hydrogen. The state is still\nspending tens of millions of dollars a year on infrastructure and hydrogen\nproduction, which can also be used to electrify heavy-duty trucks. Because a\nfuel cell powertrain weighs less than a battery, hydrogen-powered trucks can\ndrive longer distances with greater loads. Trucks also disproportionately\ncontribute to the state\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions and adverse health effects,\nparticularly on low-income communities of color.\n\n\u201cA big priority for us right now with regard to hydrogen fuel cell electric\nvehicles is to improve the reliability and performance of the existing\nrefueling network, so that those who purchased or leased hydrogen vehicles can\nbe confident they will be able to refuel when needed,\u201d says Hannon Rasool,\ndirector of the California Energy Commission\u2019s fuels and transportation\ndivision.\n\n## Related Articles\n\n  * Business |\n\nMusk denies report Tesla is scrapping less-expensive car\n\n  * Business |\n\nRivian beats EV production estimates with shipments rebounding\n\n  * Business |\n\nPrices are falling on used EVs.

Most of the hydrogen\ndispensed in California is gray, meaning it\u2019s produced from natural gas,\naccording to a state report released in December. Rasool says California has\nawarded $22 million for green hydrogen projects, including three plants that\nwill tap renewable electricity to power electrolyzers, which produce hydrogen\nfrom water. The Biden administration also awarded the state $1.2 billion to\ncreate its own hydrogen hub, which Rasool says will boost supplies of green\nhydrogen over the next eight years.\n\nWhether that means fuel cell rides can ever catch up with battery-electrics in\nthe race to decarbonize cars remains to be seen. But some superfans are\nwatching closely. If fuel prices do drop, Imahara plans to jump back on the\nhydrogen highway. She likes that hydrogen is produced in the US and that fuel\ncell cars don\u2019t rely on metals controlled by other countries. \u201cThe future\nneeds to be hydrogen and not completely battery,\u201d she says.\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to print (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share a free article with a friend\n\n###### GIFT THIS ARTICLE\n\n###### What is article sharing?\n\nSubscribers are entitled to 10 gift sharing articles each month.
