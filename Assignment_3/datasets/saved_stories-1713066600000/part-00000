The\ncalendar is packed with a whole slew of planned missions in the coming months\nand years to set the stage for a more sustained presence on the lunar surface.\nBut some astronomers want to use the Moon for something perhaps less\nexpendable than water ice \u2014 sorry, fans of For All Mankind \u2014 or a cosmic home\nbase: a vantage point to peer into Cosmic Dark Ages.\n\nGetting a look at the Cosmic Dark Ages \u2014 the period when the early universe\nwas covered in pure darkness \u2014 has long been a holy grail for astronomers. It\ncould tell us about the most fundamental aspects of our Universe and\npotentially help solve mysteries that puzzle us today.\n\n\u201cThis is a wonderful place to look for any new physics,\u201d says Jack Burn, a\nUniversity of Colorado physicist, including understanding \u201cthe nature of dark\nmatter, and maybe early dark energy, and really probe and test our fundamental\nmodels of cosmology and physics.\u201d\n\nBut to see back into the Cosmic Dark Ages you need a very dark place indeed,\nfree from a radiation-blocking ionosphere and away from the constant chatter\nwe create here on Earth. This is why astronomers like Burns and the Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory\u2019s Joseph Lazio have plans to build radio telescopes on\nthe far side of the Moon.\n\nIf engineers and astronomers at private companies, universities, NASA\u2019s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory, and Brookhaven National Laboratory have their way, the\nfar side of the moon could soon be the spot from which astronomers stare 13\nbillion years back in time, to an era before the first stars were born. Teams\nof scientists worldwide are developing concepts to build huge radio telescopes\non the far side of the Moon, and the first prototype could launch as early as\n2025, with more rudimentary telescopes set to go even sooner. Here\u2019s a look at\nthe race so far.\n\n## \u201cIf We Didn\u2019t Have a Moon, We\u2019d Have to Build It\u201d\n\nIn the beginning, as hydrogen gas drifted through the darkness of the early\nUniverse, atoms occasionally bumped into each other, releasing energy in the\nform of radio waves. The radio waves from those dark clouds of gas were 21\ncentimeters long (that\u2019s just the natural wavelength that hydrogen atoms emit,\nand they\u2019re very consistent about it). But those radio waves have spent\nbillions of years crossing a rapidly expanding universe, and that journey has\nstretched them out until they\u2019re several meters long.\n\nCharged particles in an upper layer of Earth\u2019s atmosphere, called the\nionosphere, block radio waves longer than about 10 meters, so it\u2019s impossible\nto study the Cosmic Dark Ages with a telescope here on Earth. And radio\ntelescopes, especially ones meant to map the sources of such long radio waves,\nhave to be much too large to build in space. You need something like a planet,\nbut without an ionosphere \u2013 or all the radio noise that surrounds our busy,\nhigh-tech world.\n\nBurns has argued for decades that the far side of the Moon is the best of both\nworlds. There\u2019s solid ground to build on, but there\u2019s no ionosphere to block\nincoming radiation, and the whole bulk of the Moon (2,000 miles of solid rock)\nwould shield the telescope from Earth\u2019s constant radio noise and \u2013 for two\nweeks out of every month, during the lunar night \u2013 the Sun\u2019s radio emissions,\ntoo.\n\n\u201cIt's the ideal place,\u201d says Burns. \u201cIf we didn't have a moon, we'd have to\nbuild it.\u201d\n\nThis illustration shows what FarView\u2019s zigzagging array of antennas might\neventually look like.\n\nRonald Polidan/NASA\n\nFortunately, we don\u2019t have to build the Moon \u2014 just the observatory. Burns is\nworking with Texas-based Lunar Resources, Inc. on a project called the Farview\nObservatory, which will \u2014 if everything goes according to plan \u2014 be a\n5-square-mile array of radio antennas sprawling across a lunar plain. Picture\nan antenna something like an old-fashioned television antenna; now picture\nroughly 100,000 of them, lined up end-to-end in a series of zig-zags.\nCombined, those antennas will act as one giant radio receiver, listening for\nfaint signals from the Cosmic Dark Ages.\n\nMeanwhile, at JPL, a team led by JPL robotics technologist Saptarshi\nBandyopadhyay is working on the Lunar Crater Radio Telescope, which has the\nsame scientific goal as Farview but will look very different. LCRT would be a\nsemicircle of wire mesh about a third of a mile wide, lining the bottom of a\n1.9-mile-wide crater on the Moon. The result will be a radio dish similar to\nArecibo (the large, now-shuttered observatory in Puerto Rico), but with bare\nwires instead of the aluminum panels that lined Arecibo\u2019s crater.\n\nThis artist\u2019s illustration shows what the Lunar Crater Radio Telescope might\neventually look like, with a receiver suspended over a radio dish set in a\nlunar crater.\n\nVladimir Vustyansky, JPL\n\nComparing these two possible Moon telescopes is similar to comparing Earth-\nbased telescopes like the Very Large Array (VLA) and China\u2019s Five-hundred-\nmeter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST). The VLA is an array of dish-shaped\nradio antennas lined up across a swath of New Mexico desert. It turns out that\nif you line up several radio receivers (or mirrors, if you\u2019re studying shorter\nwavelengths like infrared or visible light), and connect them with the right\nsoftware, those individual antennas can add up one giant telescope.\nAstronomers call this an interferometer.\n\nFAST and the LCRT, like the now-defunct Arecibo, are something called single-\naperture, or filled-aperture, telescopes. FAST is one enormous radio dish, set\ninto a crater that provides structural support for the dish (and the\ndelightful irony of using a crater formed by a meteor impact to study other\nobjects in space).\n\nEach design has its advantages. An interferometer like the VLA or Farview can\nsee the universe in much higher resolution than a filled-aperture telescope\nlike FAST or LCRT, because the interferometer is wider. But the tradeoff is\nthat a filled-aperture telescope like FAST or LCRT can \"see\" fainter signals\nthan an interferometer, because it's got an entire surface to catch them with.\nNeither is a \u201cbetter\u201d option than the other; radio astronomers here on Earth\nrely on both types of telescope to scan the skies.\n\n## A Truly High-Tech Construction Crew\n\nDuring a field test in the Mojave Desert, the DuAxel robot separates into two\nsingle-axled robots, connected by a tether, so that one can rappel down a\nsteep slope.\n\nNASA/JPL-Caltech/J.D. Gammell\n\nThere\u2019s one thing both telescope designs require: robotic construction teams.\nThe LCRT team plans to use pairs of rappelling construction robots, developed\nat JPL, to lay the mesh grid in the base and along the sides of their chosen\ncrater. Each pair of robots \u2014 together called a DuAxel \u2014 will be linked by a\ntether. One robot will anchor itself on the rim of the crater, while its\npartner rappels down the crater\u2019s side to actually lay out the mesh for the\ntelescope.\n\nFarview, meanwhile, has even more ambitious plans for its robotic builders,\nstarting with making the array\u2019s 100,000 antennas from scratch, using aluminum\nextracted from lunar regolith (the dusty, ground-up rock that covers the lunar\nsurface). The goal, says Burns, is to reduce the amount of material that has\nto be launched to the Moon from Earth.\n\nAnd both telescopes will depend on a satellite in lunar orbit to send data\nhome to Earth, since the far side of the Moon is constantly pointed out into\nthe vastness of space, which is the whole point.\n\nAt the moment, both are in their second phase of development under a program\ncalled NASA Advanced Innovative Concepts, which funds projects that work out\nthe engineering and science details of possible future missions like Farview\nand LCRT. Farview\u2019s team will spend the next two years devising the best\nantenna layouts, narrowing down mission requirements, and tackling other\nengineering issues. They\u2019ll also ask more specific science questions and plan\nhow to use Farview to answer them. At JPL, the LCRT team is busy working on\nsimilar problems.\n\n## One Small Step For A Lunar Lookout\n\nOne or the other of the more ambitious observatory concepts could be ready to\nlaunch to the Moon by the late 2030s, but there are no guarantees.\n\nMeanwhile, the first telescope to land on the Moon was a much smaller, much\nsimpler version of a radio telescope: a crossed pair of antennas, spanning\nabout 20 feet, called Radio wave Observation at the Lunar Surface of the\nphotoElectron Sheath (ROLSES). ROLSES landed near the south pole of the Moon\naboard Intuitive Machines\u2019 Odysseus Lander earlier this year. Its goal was to\nstudy the background radiation that already exists on the Moon. (Most of that\nradiation comes from our Sun, but that\u2019s likely to change soon, since nearly\neveryone with a space program seems to be aiming to set up shop near the lunar\nsouth pole.) Its other goal is to simply prove that a radio telescope could\nwork on the Moon\n\n\u201cThese are all kinds of multi-billion dollar projects that I think are, in\nsome sense, ahead of their time,\u201d Brookhaven National Laboratory physicist\nAn\u017ee Slosar tells Inverse. \u201cYou're not going to get a $2 billion project\nunless you can at least prove the principle at some point.\u201d\n\nThis illustration shows what LuSEE-Night might look like perched atop its\nlander.\n\nFirefly Aerospace\n\nNear the end of 2025, a similar telescope called the Lunar Surface\nElectromagnetic Experiment \u2013 Night (LuSEE-Night) is scheduled for launch\naboard a Firefly Aerospace rocket. If all goes well, it will touch down on the\nfar side of the Moon in January 2026.\n\nLike ROLSS, LuSEE-Night will be a fairly simple telescope: a pair of 20-foot-\nwide radio antennae, spring-loaded and mounted on a turntable. But LuSEE-Night\nwill try to last through a two-week-long lunar night. To do that, it will\ncarry a 110-pound battery, heavily insulated against the deep cold of lunar\ndarkness.\n\n\u201cThe main role of LuSEE-Night is really to test this theoretical promise \u2013\nwhether the Moon really is such a great place to do observation,\u201d says Slosar.\n\u201cMaybe the Moon has more ionosphere than we thought; maybe there are plasma\ntracks; maybe there are micrometeorites; maybe there's something we haven't\nthought about. Really, there is this kind of notion that the Moon is the best\nplace, but nobody has tested it.\u201d\n\nLUSEE-Night will do some real science, too. It\u2019s too small to capture the\nlong, slow radio waves rippling in from the Cosmic Dark Ages, but it will also\nbe astronomers\u2019 first chance to test their models of what the galaxy should\nlook like at low radio frequencies they can\u2019t see from Earth.\n\nOnce we have eyes on the moon, there\u2019s no telling what we\u2019ll be able to see.\n\nRelated Tags\n\n  * Physics\n  * NASA\n  * Space Science\n\n", "frontpage": false}
