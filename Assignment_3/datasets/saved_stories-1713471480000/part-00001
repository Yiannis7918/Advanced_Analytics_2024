What happened?\n\nNew AI programs that analyze bodycam recordings promise more transparency but\nare doing little to change culture.\n\nby\n\n  * Patrick Sisson archive page\n\nApril 16, 2024\n\nOn July 25 last year, in circuit court in Dane County, Wisconsin, a motion was\nfiled to dismiss a criminal case as a result of what defense attorneys\ndescribed as \u201cinstitutional bad-faith actions\u201d by a local police department.\nThe evidence was unearthed, in part, because of artificial intelligence.\n\nAttorney Jessa Nicholson Goetz had been preparing to defend her client against\na sexual assault charge that arose from a 2021 Tinder date. During pretrial\nmotions, Nicholson Goetz\u2019s co-counsel noticed discrepancies around how the\nlead police investigator was discussing and documenting his use of a body\ncamera, which department policy required him to wear at all times. Nicholson\nGoetz asked to review footage connected to the investigation; she said the\npolice department delivered 40 hours of video before the trial began.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis kind of data dump is commonplace, typically right before the start of a\ntrial. Manually reviewing body camera footage isn\u2019t always a useful source of\ninsight into a case; more often, especially for defense attorneys without\nresources, it\u2019s a nightmare. Actually watching the tapes is very time\nconsuming, and paying to have them transcribed can add tens of thousands of\ndollars to tight budgets.\n\nBut this time, Nicholson Goetz and her team were using JusticeText, an AI-\npowered evidence management program that two former University of Chicago\ncomputer science students named Devshi Mehrotra and Leslie Jones-Dove\ndeveloped when they were outraged at the police killing of Laquan McDonald in\ntheir city in 2014. JusticeText analyzes the audio from bodycam footage,\ntranscribes it, and marks it up in minutes, not hours. Released in 2021, it\nnow aids private criminal attorneys as well as public defenders in states such\nas Texas, Massachusetts, and Kentucky.\n\nAlthough it did not reveal anything that would have directly proved her\nclient\u2019s innocence, JusticeText did bring to light possible evidence of police\nmalfeasance\u2014specifically, destruction of \u201capparently and potentially\nexculpatory evidence,\u201d according to the motion.\n\nAfter going through just a few JusticeText analyses of videos, Nicholson Goetz\nfroze when she read the following transcribed directions the investigator gave\nto the alleged victim, who was a prosecution witness: \u201cOkay, I\u2019m trying to\nspeak vaguely here. Um. Just because, you know, I don\u2019t want this on record.\u201d\nThe witness would later ask the investigator whether they were speaking in\nconfidence, and he responded that he wasn\u2019t going to put their conversation\ninto police reports. In light of this exchange and what Nicholson Goetz\ndescribes in the motion as the department\u2019s alleged propensity to \u201cmishandle,\ndestroy, intentionally omit, recklessly fail to preserve evidence,\u201d including\ncamera footage from the night in question that could have had exculpatory\nvalue, she filed the motion to dismiss. The judge would eventually dismiss the\ncase, noting in a decision on March 8 that \u201c[the defendant\u2019s] defense has\nsuffered irreparable prejudice due to [the investigator\u2019s] actions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout JusticeText, the trial would have started, instead of being delayed\nand dismissed,\u201d Nicholson Goetz says. \u201cThis has changed the way that I do my\ndiscovery, because now I\u2019m really very curious as to what\u2019s out there.\u201d\n\n> Bodycams have generated millions of hours of video footage, most of which\n> goes unwatched.\n\nNo one is entirely sure what is out there. When police departments began\nbuying and deploying bodycams in earnest in the wake of the police killing of\nMichael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014, activists hoped it would bring\nabout real change. The cameras were originally hailed as \u201csupervisory force\nmultipliers,\u201d says Seth Stoughton, a law professor at the University of South\nCarolina who studies the technology.\n\nYears later, despite what\u2019s become a multibillion-dollar market for these\ndevices, the tech is far from a panacea.\n\nPart of the problem is scale: bodycams have generated millions of hours of\nvideo footage, most of which goes unwatched. Police departments also\nsystematically delay releasing footage, and they often refuse to discipline\nofficers who fail to wear the cameras properly. And when they do finally\nprovide video to the public, it\u2019s often selectively edited, lacking context\nand failing to tell the complete story. A recent New York Times analysis\nconcluded that bodycams \u201cmay do more to serve police interests than those of\nthe public they are sworn to protect.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA handful of AI startups see this problem as an opportunity to create what are\nessentially bodycam-to-text programs for different players in the legal\nsystem, mining this footage for misdeeds. That could help improve\nprofessionalism within the police. But like the bodycams themselves, the\ntechnology still faces procedural, legal, and cultural barriers to success.\n\n## Related Story\n\nWelcome to Chula Vista, where police drones respond to 911 calls\n\nThe technology is already out in force in some cities, but the true debate on\nprivacy and policies is lagging behind.\n\nIn essence, bodycam analysis programs work in three steps. First, a speech\nrecognition algorithm turns the audio into draft text; after recordings get\nbroken up into phonemes, the smallest unit of sound, a probability analysis\ndetermines how these building blocks come together in words and sentences.\nThen a machine-learning algorithm and natural-language-processing programs,\ntrained on vast collections of text and previous conversations, clean up the\nrough copy and remove errors. Finally, the system checks that finished copy\nfor specific keywords and patterns, which are flagged and analyzed.\n\nThe true test of the technology will be whether it can accurately scan and\nscour hours and hours of unwatched video. But a more important question is\nwhether it can meet a bigger challenge: moving the process and culture of\npolicing toward accountability.\n\nJusticeText is tackling these issues at the court level. During its\ndevelopment, cofounder Mehrotra and her colleagues surveyed public defenders\nand found that roughly 80% of their cases involved data of some sort. Most\ndefenders, serving dozens of defendants simultaneously, couldn\u2019t ingest this\ntype of evidence, understand it, and present it in court, putting them at a\ndisadvantage. To help address the problem, JusticeText spent time building\ntools to set up timelines for attorneys and making sure the system was able to\nread files from different vendors and police departments.\n\nMehrotra says she\u2019s hearing from attorneys who have gotten high-level felony\ncases dismissed outright after using the program to analyze bodycam\nrecordings. Before, she says, they didn\u2019t have time to pull clips from these\nfiles. Now they\u2019re walking into court with highlight reels.\n\nOther firms working on similar technology think its best use is in helping the\npolice more effectively police themselves. Polis Solutions is developing an AI\ntool to analyze not only audio but also facial expressions caught by these\ncameras. Another company, Truleo, offers tailored video-to-text transcription\nservices for police departments. Cofounder Anthony Tassone envisions flagging\nincidents that need review, bringing attention to positive policing, and\nsharing video clips for training; he hopes to create a \u201cTikTok for cops.\u201d His\nsales pitch has connected with law enforcement. Currently, 28 departments use\nthe service, including New York City\u2019s. The NYPD signed up for a Truleo trial\nlast October; 1,000 of the force\u2019s roughly 36,000 officers are set to be\ntracked and trained with the system.\n\nA tech-savvy stock trader who has been building natural-language-processing\nmodels for decades, Tassone has long been dedicated to police foundations and\ncauses, donating to fundraisers and serving on the board of the FBI National\nAcademy. The police chiefs he met while fundraising had common complaints: a\nshortage of supervisors, challenges with new recruits who didn\u2019t meet current\nperformance standards, and the difficulty of rewarding good policing. Tassone\nsaw AI as a way to help address these challenges. Turn the tech loose on the\naudio of bodycam footage, he thought, and you could create transcripts that\nsupervisors could use to track, study, and improve officers\u2019 interactions with\nmembers of the public.\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s perception was that bodycam footage was a liability,\u201d Tassone\nsays. \u201cThey [police department higher-ups] didn\u2019t want to view it unless\nthere\u2019s a horrific use-of-force or civilian complaint. I just thought that was\ndumb. This is like game-time footage of all your athletes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTassone claims that Truleo, which hit the market in 2021, can identify events\nlike an officer frisking someone or reading Miranda rights to a suspect, and\ncalculate a professionalism score. The software doesn\u2019t eliminate human\nreview, he says; it augments it. Police chiefs or supervisors set up lists of\nkeywords or events, get emails and notifications when the system detects these\ntriggers, and then review the footage. Truleo\u2019s tech is installed on\ndepartment servers, so the data remains sequestered.\n\nIn the company\u2019s own studies, Tassone claims, officers monitored by Truleo\nalways score better than the control group; a study of one client, the police\ndepartment in Alameda, California, found a 36% reduction in uses of force. No\nthird-party analyses of Truleo have yet been completed; researchers at the\nnonprofit RTI are currently studying its analysis of bodycam footage from\nGeorgia state parole and probation officers, but results aren\u2019t expected\nanytime soon. Secure Justice, a nonprofit based in Oakland, California, that\nfocuses on police tech and abuses of power, briefly considered pushing a bill\nto mandate the use of Truleo across the state, but executive director Brian\nHofer says the group hadn\u2019t \u201cdone sufficient due diligence at this stage to be\ncomfortable making an aggressive move like that\u201d and may revisit the idea in\n2025.\n\n> \u201cIt just opens up law enforcement\u2019s frame of surveillance in a way that we\n> haven\u2019t really previously had to deal with.\u201d\n>\n> Beryl Lipton, investigative researcher, Electronic Frontier Foundation\n\nStill, Hofer suspects the technology does work. In fact, that very efficacy\nmay be one reason it hasn\u2019t been universally welcomed: drama has erupted\nwithin two police departments that used and then dropped Truleo. In Vallejo,\nCalifornia, officers and police union officials objected to the introduction\nof the technology, with its potential to reveal unsavory behavior, and blamed\nit for inaccuracies and labor violations. The controversy helped accelerate\nthe departure of the department\u2019s reformist chief, Shawny Williams, last July.\nIn Seattle, where the police department also canceled its contract with Truleo\namid union objections, an officer was caught on bodycam footage last fall\nmocking a woman\u2019s death; Truleo had flagged the incident.\n\nPolice officers aren\u2019t the only ones with reasons to question this technology,\nthough. The growing use of bodycam-to-text programs, along with increased use\nof cameras and drones, further normalizes surveillance by law enforcement,\nadding more everyday interactions to a searchable, indexable database.\nJennifer Lee, former manager of the technology and liberty project at the ACLU\nof Washington, said in a statement that \u201cthe potential to use AI technology\nfor purposes other than accountability raises significant questions that must\nbe addressed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt just opens up law enforcement\u2019s frame of surveillance in a way that we\nhaven\u2019t really previously had to deal with so much but increasingly have to\ndeal with constantly,\u201d says Beryl Lipton, an investigative researcher at the\nElectronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit digital rights group. The\nrecording, transcription, and cataloguing of what someone says on the street\nin public during interactions with police raises a red flag, she says. She\nalso points to concerns about bias and inaccuracy in the technology itself\nthat arose when phone calls from prisoners were recorded, analyzed, and later\nmade searchable via AI.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to fully address such concerns because, as with many AI\nsystems, the exact way these bodycam-to-text systems work remains opaque, and\nit\u2019s all the more so when outsiders can\u2019t know what terms police departments\nare searching for. Besides, the significance of their findings depends on\ncontext, says Rob Voigt, a Northwestern University researcher and linguistics\nexpert, who coauthored a 2017 paper that used bodycam footage to measure\nracial disparities in police attitudes toward minorities.\n\n\u201cCan you make a computational model that can identify what\u2019s a threat or not?\nThat\u2019s really complicated,\u201d he says.\n\nPolice departments have little incentive to ask pointed questions about racial\nbias, Voigt says, and those questions are central to reforming the policing\nmodel. The promise of these bodycam-to-text programs won\u2019t be fully met if key\nterms, phrases, and interactions aren\u2019t commonly tagged and analyzed. And even\nif they are, trusting law enforcement to do the right thing with whatever data\na system like Truleo or Polis produces might be misguided.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven Truleo\u2019s Tassone can\u2019t answer the \u201cWho\u2019s watching the watchmen?\u201d question\nin a wholly satisfying way.\n\nTassone claims that Truleo has identified otherwise unrecorded use-of-force\nincidents or police pursuits, but he declines to provide examples. When\npressed about whether those incidents get reported to the public, he said, \u201cWe\nhave no idea what happens downstream from our technology. That\u2019s on the\ndepartment to follow up with that. Our mission is to give them the tools to\nfind these things.\u201d\n\n## Related Story\n\nHow an undercover content moderator polices the metaverse\n\n\u201cWe can be the first line of defense.\u201d\n\nTools are no good unless they\u2019re used, of course, and the ability to analyze\npolice performance isn\u2019t helpful if bodycam recordings don\u2019t exist in the\nfirst place. Cops can simply turn off the camera or \u201cforget\u201d to turn it on, in\nwhich case there is simply nothing to examine. And since Truleo sequesters\neach department\u2019s data, there\u2019s no opportunity to do any meta-analysis of\npolice performance, which academics say would provide a gold mine of data.\nAdvocates for police reform also can\u2019t, say, file a public records request and\nuse the tool to comb archival footage for the past actions of certain cops, or\nfind patterns of misbehavior; no third party is using it to watch how cops are\nbehaving. EFF\u2019s Lipton says if the technology works as advertised, and its\nmakers really want to improve public trust, it seems like \u201ca waste of money\nand a missed opportunity\u201d not to make it available to the public.\n\nFinally, law enforcement will likely continue to push back against the release\nof bodycam recordings, and slow-walk and delay the release of any questionable\nfootage.\n\n\u201cWe need to worry about applying technological solutions to sociological\nproblems,\u201d says the University of South Carolina\u2019s Stoughton. \u201cNothing about\nTruleo will fundamentally change the culture of a police department, or alter\na public commitment to accountability that doesn\u2019t have behind-the-doors\nfollow-through.\u201d\n\nTruleo\u2019s track record when it comes to changing the culture of law enforcement\nis decidedly mixed so far. The police force in Castle Shannon, Pennsylvania,\nhas used the system for roughly two years with generally positive results.\nChief of police Ken Truver, a self-described evangelist for law enforcement\ntech, says that even with just 14 officers in his department, actually\nwatching and utilizing hours of bodycam footage becomes overwhelming. He\u2019s\nconstantly thinking about what he\u2019s missing, since even mandated spot checks\ninvolve only about 1% of what\u2019s stored. Truleo helps him efficiently review\nbehavior; every day at 6 p.m. he gets an email with incidents to flag and\ncheck. He claims he hasn\u2019t found any untoward behavior.\n\n\u201cPolice are generally cynical of technology,\u201d he says. \u201cThe first thing\nthey\u2019re gonna say is, \u2018How could I possibly get in trouble with this\ntechnology?\u2019 The purpose of the technology is not to find an officer doing\nsomething wrong. Matter of fact, the opposite is true. I want to find my\nofficers doing something right.\u201d\n\nBut the rank-and-file officers in Vallejo, California, argued that the\ntechnology did the reverse. Their frustration with the system was one factor\nthat led to the departure of the chief responsible for setting up Truleo.\nMichael Nichelini, president of the Vallejo Police Officers\u2019 Association,\nfeels the technology was meant for discipline. He\u2019s not against transparency,\nhe says, but he\u2019s sick of efforts to change the department\u2019s culture. He\u2019s\nfrustrated with poor pay and understaffing, and he objects to what he sees as\nefforts to fix those issues with software instead of addressing them with\nbetter leadership and compensation. In the Seattle case, too, a police union\npresident accused department leaders of using the tech to \u201cspy\u201d on officers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTassone, who was raised in a police and military family on Chicago\u2019s South\nSide, dismisses the privacy complaints from cops.\n\n\u201cNothing they say on camera is considered private. That\u2019s all public records,\u201d\nhe says. \u201cAll my work on Wall Street for 20 years, all my emails, had\nidentical employee quality assurance monitoring in place. The idea that police\nwouldn\u2019t have it when they have guns and badges, ability to take people\u2019s\nrights\u2014nobody\u2019s going to support that.\u201d\n\nTruleo takes issues of privacy for police and civilians very seriously; video\nis never analyzed, and personally identifiable information is automatically\nscrubbed. \u201cWe need to be super sensitive and super delicate around how the\ntechnology is deployed to maximize civilian privacy,\u201d Tassone says.\n\nHe believes these kinds of safeguards make the proposition simply\nirresistible: better transparency for a low monthly fee. He expects that local\nand state lawmakers will mandate the use of Truleo or other bodycam-to-text\nsoftware.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be the future of policing,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019ll be the law\nwithin five years.\u201d\n\nPatrick Sisson, a Chicago expat living in Los Angeles, covers technology and\nurbanism.\n\n### by Patrick Sisson\n\n### Share\n\n  * Share story on linkedin\n\n  * Share story on twitter\n\n  * Share story on facebook\n\n  * Share story on email\n\n### Deep Dive\n\n### Policy\n\n### Is there anything more fascinating than a hidden world?\n\nSome hidden worlds--whether in space, deep in the ocean, or in the form of\nwaves or microbes--remain stubbornly unseen.
