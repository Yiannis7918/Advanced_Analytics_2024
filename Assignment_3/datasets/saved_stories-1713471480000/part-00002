This month, Rafael Sadykov will talk about using ACL2 for the\nhardware verification of cryptographic chips.\n\nTo attend, you must register here in accordance with Stripe\u2019s security policy.\nIf you only RSVP on Meetup.com, you will be asked to register at the door when\nyou arrive.\n\nAbstract: This presentation focuses on ACL2 for the hardware verification of\ncryptographic chips that utilize the Feistel block ciphers. ACL2, a powerful\ntheorem prover and a variant of Common Lisp, is instrumental in verifying the\ncorrectness and security of hardware designs. The presentation delves into\nmethodologies for ensuring that cryptographic hardware (designed in Verilog)\nmeets rigorous safety and performance standards. It highlights the challenges\nand solutions in hardware verification, describing the role of formal methods\nin achieving low-latency bug-free cryptographic devices.\n\nSpeaker: Rafael Sadykov is a mathematician with a degree in Fundamental\nMathematics and Mechanics, an M.Sc. in Financial Mathematics and a PhD (ABD)\nin Computer Science. His work spans formal software verification, blockchain\ndesign, smart contract verification, and ML. He's also developed courses in\nsoftware quality, formal verification, and deep learning.\n\n## COVID-19 safety measures\n\nEvent will be indoors\n\nThe event host is instituting the above safety measures for this event.
