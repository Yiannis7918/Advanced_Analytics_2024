Students are\nflocking to arts degrees in record numbers despite a 113% rise in student\ncontributions for communications, humanities and society and culture degrees,\nimplemented as part of the widely condemned Job-ready Graduates (JRG) scheme.\n\nIt\u2019s equivalent to $16,323 a year, or about $50,000 for a three-year degree.\n\nThe University of NSW is among many of Australia\u2019s largest institutions where\nenrolments for humanities and arts degrees are growing despite higher fees.\nPhotograph: Carly Earl/The Guardian\n\nDespite the spike, Australia\u2019s largest universities including UNSW, the\nUniversity of Melbourne, the University of Sydney and Monash have all\nexperienced a jump in applications for arts degrees, leading to higher\nenrolments.\n\nAustralian students struggling to put food on the table in unpaid training,\nbut this could be a thing of the past\n\nRead more\n\nAt the University of Melbourne, demand for its Bachelor of Arts degree is\nhigher in 2024 than any time in the past five years.\n\n  * Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\n\nIt\u2019s had a 14% surge in the number of first preferences for the bachelor\nprogram since 2022, while enrolments have also jumped since 2021, rising from\n1,597 to 1,641 this year.\n\nMonash University has seen first preferences for arts degrees rise by 11%\nsince 2021. Enrolments jumped almost 2% this year, at the same rate as the\nUniversity of Sydney, which has consistently grown its arts enrolments since\nthe JRG reforms were introduced.\n\nProf Claire Annesley, dean of arts, design and architecture at UNSW, says\nthere has been a \u201cmassive swell\u201d of students choosing degrees in her faculty.\n\nFirst preferences for arts degrees surged by 14% at UNSW this year, while the\nstudent course load was also up.\n\n\u201cI think they can see the future better than we can,\u201d she says. \u201cThis\ngeneration of young people will be creating jobs you and I can\u2019t imagine \u2013 and\nindustry knows that as well.\u201d\n\nThe latest graduate outcomes survey reported the largest increase in\nemployment rates in the field of humanities (up from 81.7% in 2021 to 86.6% in\n2022).\n\nMedian graduate salaries also jumped, sitting at $66,700 compared with\nsciences and mathematics at $66,000 and business and management $65,000.\n\nAn \u2018exciting advance\u2019 or \u2018poor public policy\u2019?

Complex societal problems \u2013 from the\nclimate emergency to the pandemic \u2013 need effective communicators and\npolicymakers.\n\n\u201cAI can reproduce what we already know, but creativity is an innately human\nskill,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cRight now we\u2019re penalising people we need to be part of the business of\ninnovation and core solutions. There\u2019s an urgency here.\u201d\n\nThe CEO of Universities Australia, Luke Sheehy, says JRG \u201cfailed\u201d to encourage\nstudents into certain disciplines and instead shifted additional costs on to\nstudents and universities.\n\nAccording to the University Admissions Centre (UAC), which manages\napplications for New South Wales universities, 21% of first preferences were\ndirected to society and culture degrees in the most recent intake, with\nroughly the same number of offers provided.\n\nThe most popular courses were a Bachelor of Arts at the University of Sydney\nand a Bachelor of Double Law at UNSW.\n\nThe figures are nearly identical to 2021. Yet in the same period, first\npreferences to health, historically the most popular study area, have reduced\n(28% to 25%), as year 12 applicants have turned to arts degrees in higher\nnumbers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already called and will continue to call on government to prioritise\nstudent support measures in the forthcoming budget,\u201d he says.\n\nThe Universities Accord final report recommended JRG needed \u201curgent\nremediation\u201d, adding it had \u201csignificantly and unfairly increased what\nstudents repay\u201d.\n\nThe education minister, Jason Clare, told Guardian Australia the government\nwould respond to the recommendations in the accord \u201cshortly\u201d.\n\nBut to Magee, the further into his course he gets, the more concerned about\nhis economic future he becomes.\n\n\u201cDown the road, my student debt will take a lot of my income ... it worries\nme,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe government should be encouraging students to find paths they enjoy, not\nrestricting it.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Australian education\n  * Higher education\n  * Australian universities\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Comments (...)\n\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
