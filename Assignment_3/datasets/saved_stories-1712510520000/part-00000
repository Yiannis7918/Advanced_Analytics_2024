We are very pleased to present the latest and greatest release of\nKodi, v21.0 \"Omega\".\n\nWith this release we have seen over 3,750 commits since v20.0 \"Nexus\" was\navailable to the world on January 15th, 2023. As always, this has been a huge\neffort from many contributors, testers and supporters. Thanks go out to our\nteam members, plus everyone in our community who sent in a pull request,\ntested and gave feedback, or provided support to users on the forum. We always\nappreciate your contribution to making Kodi better.\n\nLet's review some of the changes you can expect:\n\n### Major Features\n\nFFmpeg 6\n\nKodi relies significantly on FFmpeg to do a lot of heavy lifting for us. Many\ndevelopers have contributed to upgrading the project to make use of the newer\nFFmpeg releases over the past 15 months, initially starting with targeting\nFFmpeg 5, but later updating to FFmpeg 6. We are always greatly appreciative\nof the work of all of the Open Source software projects that we rely on to\nbring you Kodi.\n\nDolbyVision On-the-Fly Profile Conversion\n\nFor our Android users, a fantastic contribution from quietvoid allows users to\nconvert some less well-supported DV profile types to more well-supported\nprofiles.\n\nmacOS Now Uses \"Native\" Windowing\n\nAnother change that has been years in the making. This was started by some\namazing developers many years ago, and we have now been able to finally remove\nthe last remnants of SDL library usage in Kodi. We now use native\nimplementations for window displays on the Apple macOS platform.\n\nA New Platform: webOS\n\nA new platform can now run Kodi natively: a port to LG webOS TVs has been\nworked out by some amazing developers who have reverse engineered huge amounts\nof the webOS media pipelines. One of our newest team members, sundermann, has\nhelped shepherd our newest supported platform, to extend the reach of Kodi to\neven more devices.\n\nIn-game Player Viewer\n\nController configuration for games gets a little better in v21: a window has\nbeen added in-game to view which game port each player's controller is\ncurrently connected to.\n\nBehind the Scenes\n\nA large majority of changes are \"under the hood\" and invisible to users but\nimprove the stability, performance, and safety of Kodi: API changes have been\nmade to evolve Python and binary add-ons and bring new skinning features;\nthere are updates to Kodi dependencies on most if not all Kodi platforms;\nfixes from regular use of code static-analysis tools, database migration fixes\nfor a smoother update ... and lots more.\n\nThere are too many individual changes to detail everything. If you would like\nto know more, please look back through the Omega Alpha to RC2 release\nannouncements and review the GitHub changelog here.\n\nTime doesn't stand still, and we have already branched Kodi v22 \"P*\" for\ndevelopment. Thank you again for your continued support as we continue to make\nKodi great!\n\nHelp Wanted!\n\nIf you experience any issues or find any remaining bugs, please post in the\nGeneral Support section of our forum. If you have fixes for issues please\nsubmit a pull request with your changes to our master branch on GitHub. We\nalso welcome users who want to help answer questions in the forum or write\narticles for the wiki.\n\nDonate\n\nTo show support and appreciation for Kodi, please consider making a donation\nor purchasing merchandise such as a T-shirt or Raspberry Pi case. Your\ndonations are greatly appreciated and help us to function, covering operating\nexpenses, hardware and software licences for developers, and legal fees, as\nwell as paying for team members to attend industry/FLOSS events and our annual\nconference.\n\nAvailability\n\nKodi 21.0 \"Omega\" is being pushed to the usual channels right now, both our\nown download pages and various app stores/repositories, so should be with your\ndevices shortly. It's worth noting that, for the first time in a while, we've\ncleared all known blockers, so all supported platforms will be updated just as\nsoon as the various app stores process things.\n\nIf you are an Android user and wish to update to Kodi 21.0 as soon as\npossible, you can either sideload, or join the Google Play - Kodi testing\ntrack which will get the release submitted more quickly. The \"open\" release\nwill be promoted from the testing track in a week or two. We strongly advise\nAndroid users who use alternative skins to follow up with their skin\ndeveloper, or to disable auto update before this time period, as not every\nskin will yet have been updated.\n\n## Footer\n\nKodi is a free and open source media player application developed by the Kodi\nFoundation, a non-profit technology consortium.
