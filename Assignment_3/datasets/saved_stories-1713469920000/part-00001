Remember, in any interview you're trying to get to know the company\nand the people you might be working with as much as they're trying to get to\nknow you. Maybe more.\n\nThere are a lot of questions here. Some are just simple nuts-and-bolts\nquestions. Some are only appropriate for certain types of companies. Some\nmight help after you've already got a whiff of an org smell. You'll never ask\nall of these -- there's no time! But usually, after you've read the role\ndescription and had a phone screen, you should have a pretty good idea of\nwhich questions you want to highlight and ask.\n\nI've broken them out by subject matter, with some notes on things to look for.\n\nIf you'd like more questions for director-and-above positions, Jacob Kaplan-\nMoss has a great list.\n\n## Table of contents\n\n  * Getting started\n  * Culture\n  * Work/life balance\n  * Bureaucracy\n  * Diversity, equity, inclusion and ethics\n  * Understanding the company and team\n  * Leadership\n  * Doing the work\n  * Career development\n  * Performance evaluation\n  * Compensation\n  * For engineering organizations\n  * Things to look for in real life\n\n## Getting started\n\nWhat is the onboarding process like? Do they have one? How well-defined is it?\nDo they have a \"buddy system\" or some other mechanisms to help you get ramped\nup, or do they just let you sink or swim?\n\nIn the first 60 to 90 days of employment, what would be my most urgent\npriorities? This is helpful for getting past the position description to the\nreal expectations of the work. Plus the first 90 days are critical.\n\nWhat are the key accomplishments you\u2019d like to see in this role over the next\nyear? What is the one thing I absolutely must get right the first year? This\none extends on the previous question, looking longer term. This helps you get\na sense of what your success criteria would be as well as how well the\nemployer has defined the role. This one can also help get a better sense of\nthe real priorities, which may differ from what the role description\nindicated. If they don't have clear answers to either of these questions, the\nrole is probably poorly defined and not set up for success.\n\nWhat does success look like for your customers for someone in this role? A\ngood question to help get a sense of how user-focused the organization is.\n\n## Culture\n\nWhat type of people are successful here? What type of people are not?\nAlternate: What characteristics do the people who are most celebrated have in\ncommon with each other? Conversely, what are the characteristics that are\ncommon to the promising people you hired, but who then flamed out and failed\nor left? Pay close attention to this one. You can potentially pick up a lot of\nred flags about what type of culture they really have versus what kind of\nculture they want you to think they have. The phrase \"culture fit\" itself can\nbe a warning sign of homogenous, non-inclusive, bro-grammer culture.\n\nHow do you determine if someone is a poor fit for the company? Same as above,\nthey may tell you more than they mean to about what they value (and what they\ndon't).\n\nIf an employee does something harmful that isn't a fireable offense, how do\nyou handle that? What steps do you take to create a culture of accountability?\nThey should have a plan for this. If they don't, any number of toxic-but-not-\nfireable behaviors are probably not being addressed.\n\nIs there any sort of institutionalized way of dealing with plateauing or\npreventing burnout? You should hear something about rotation of duties or\nlocation, sabbaticals, etc. In other words, a real plan for avoiding burnout,\nnot empty platitudes. Follow-up: Is it possible to take sabbaticals or unpaid\nvacation?\n\nHow does internal communication work? How does the company communicate with\nitself, and is that effective? This can be a really telling question. Are\ncompany communications scattered? Leaked out? Top down? How does it work? Does\nit work?\n\nAre there catered suppers? This may sound like a nice perk, but you may want\nto learn more about why it's necessary. In a properly functioning organization\nwith normal 8-5 or 9-5 hours, you should be home for supper. In crunch times\nit's nice when the organization brings in some decent food, but does the org\nfind itself in crunch times all the time? If so, why?\n\nWhat is your turnover rate? How many people were hired last year and how many\nleft? Over the past 2-3 years? What is the average time that people stay at\nthe company? Attrition is one of the strongest tells that a culture is bad. If\nmore than 30% of the company left in the past year, that's a real problem.\nWhat is the company doing about it?\n\nHow are disagreements solved? What happens when personalities clash? You're\nlooking for a real, equitable and fair plan here, not a handwave-y answer.\n\nGiven everything you like about the company culture, what's the flip side?\nWhat failure modes do you think your culture creates? Are those potential\nfailure modes or have you seen them happen? How do you try to guard against\nthem? Even great cultural choices have downsides. If the person who's\nanswering you has been in the company for a while and can't give you a good\nanswer, either they're unwilling to give you bad news about the company, or\nthey're not very thoughtful about the culture and its failure modes.\n\n## Work/life balance\n\nHow many hours a week does senior management work? Do they put in 80-hour\nweeks? If so, run away.\n\nHow much vacation do people get? If there's \"unlimited\" vacation, how much\nvacation do people normally take? What is the expectation for \"excessive\"\nvacation? There is always a number.\n\nWhat holidays are observed? Some companies do not observe federal and state\nholidays. For parents, this can be a real problem since schools usually do. If\nso, you may have to use a vacation day for your child's holiday.\n\nDoes this position require travel? How often? This should have been in the job\npost, but if it wasn't, ask about it and think about how it fits with your\nlifestlye and commitments. Some folks are fine being road warriors, but if\nyou've got kids or other commitments at home, it can be difficult.\n\nWould I need to be on call? How often? Another nuts-and-bolts question, but\non-call rotations can be tough. While you're asking, consider asking of being\non-call comes with extra compensation.\n\nHow many hours do people work in an average week? What time do people normally\nleave work? What time do they normally start? Do people work on the weekend?\nSeriously, if the job can't be done in 40 hours, more or less, something is\nprobably wrong.\n\nDo people check in when they're on vacation? They shouldn't, and they\nshouldn't be expected to. Take the vacation.\n\nWhat kinds of tasks are routinely demanded of by management beyond the\noriginal job description? This can be a bit confrontational, or can sound like\nyou want to do nothing more than what's explicitly in the job description. Be\ncareful with it. Still, it can be useful if you're concerned you may be asked\nto walk your manager's dog or something weird.\n\nWhat is the rhythm to the work? Is there a time that's \u201call hands on deck\u201d and\neveryone pulls all-nighters, or is it pretty consistent throughout the year?\n\nHow often are there emergencies or times when people have to work extra hours?\nFor most orgs, the number of emergencies and unplanned extra hours should be\nnear zero. Generally speaking, emergencies indicate either faulty DevOps or\nfaulty management. There are times and places where extra hours should be\nexpected -- if you're involved in taxes in the U.S. in any way, you know April\nis busy, for example -- so it's worthwhile to differentiate planned extra\nhours from unplanned.\n\nAre the company\u2019s managers inclined to call employees at home with questions\nor comments? If so, that could be an indicator of poor boundaries or a poor\nwork-life balance. Or it could just be a busy boss trying to catch up with\nyou. Use your judgement and ask follow-up questions if you're concerned.\n\n## Bureaucracy\n\nWalk me through the process of expensing a $[price] [item] Choose an item and\nprice -- that could be a $50 book or something larger, it doesn't matter. What\nyou're looking for here is a process that sounds reasonable and navigable for\nthe price and item you chose.\n\nHow many layers of company managers or executives does one have to go through\nto get approval for a new idea? The more layers, the more difficult and time\nconsuming it will be. Well-defined process can mitigate the difficulty, but it\nis still a good indicator of overall bureaucracy and speed.\n\nWhat is the policy on alternate work schedules? Is variability okay, or is\neveryone expected to be on the same schedule? In modern orgs, especially\ndistributed orgs, asking everyone to punch the clock at the same time is\nbackwards, at best.\n\nWhat is your remote work policy? Why is that your remote work policy?\n\nWhat is the company\u2019s policy on work/life balance? How does that work out in\npractice?\n\nIs it easy to move to other divisions or offices? Warning: the interviewer\ncould infer that you are a difficult teammate and like to jump around.\n\nWhat information is shared with the employees in terms of revenue, costs,\noperating metrics, etc? Is this an \u201copen book\u201d shop, or do they play it closer\nto the vest? How is information shared? How do you get access to the\ninformation you need to be successful?\n\nDoes the company require a prospective employee to sign a non-compete\ncontract? If so, could you explain in a few words how restrictive it is. Is it\nnegotiable?\n\n## Diversity, equity, inclusion, belonging, and ethics\n\nTell me about a situation where someone raised a concern about DE&I or ethics?\nHow was it handled? If not, have there really not been any? Is management\nlistening?\n\nTell me about the organization leadership demographics. What specifically are\nyou doing to drive greater diversity in management? Bad orgs don\u2019t know or get\ndefensive; good orgs are open and transparent; the best orgs share what\nthey\u2019re doing to improve. Follow-up: What benefits do you expect from\nincreasing diversity among leadership?\n\nTell me about your effort to attract a diverse pool of candidates. What\nmetrics are they currently using to track DE&I in hiring?\n\nTell me about your efforts to retain a diverse group of employees. This is a\nparticularly useful question. Lots of companies try to recruit diverse\ncandidates and then don't do much at all after that to keep them. Again, what\nare the metrics they're using to track this?\n\nTell me about a time when a challenge or suggestion from an under-represented\ngroup was acted on in their favor? How long ago was that?\n\nHow transparent is your salary and compensation data? Not long ago, most orgs\ndid not share salary and compensation info at all. State salary transparency\nlaws have been changing that, but the information can still be vague or\nmisleading. The best orgs will understand why salary transparency is valuable.\n\nAm I the only one [in the demographic or under-represented group I identify as\na member of]? If so, how do you plan to do to ensure that I am welcome,\nincluded and equal? Incorrect answers include blinking in confusion, saying\n\"everything's fine and we don't see why we'd have to do anything in\nparticular\", and \"you're not the only one; we have a [person] in a\n$other_role!\" Follow-up: Where do you anticipate challenges?\n\nDo you have a standard insurance package that covers trans health care? Even\nif you yourself might not use the insurance package, this still gives you good\ninsight into their commitment to inclusion.\n\nDo you offer paternity leave, or just maternity leave? If they only offer\nmaternity leave it can say a lot about the roles they expect women to play.\n\nMost/all of my interviewers were men. Can I speak to someone else on the team\nto hear more about their own experience? Does the team lacks diverse\nperspectives?\n\n## Understanding the company and team\n\nHow are your teams structured? What is the management structure like? Pay\nparticular attention if you have any questions about reporting or power\nstructures. Get clarity.\n\nWhat\u2019s the biggest challenge the team has gone through in the last year? Does\nthe team currently feel optimistic about what's next? Useful for getting a\nsense of team morale and working conditions.\n\nIs this a new role? If so, follow up with more questions about how the company\nplans to get buy-in for this new role and support the people in it. This can\nbe useful to understand how well-defined the position is and if it's a\nposition set up for success. If it is not a new role, see if you can learn\nmore about why the person left. Best case is they were promoted up, meaning\nthis role can lead to similar opportunities for you. Follow-ups:\n\n  * If this is a replacement position, what happened to the former employee? How long were they in the role?\n  * If it's a new position, how is the company supporting it? What does success look like?\n\nHow does the organization reward employees? Is it a star system / team-\noriented / equity-based / bonus-based / golf-clap-based? Does it reward\nindividual performance? Team performance? Is the reward tangible and real? How\ndoes the company demonstrate to an employee that they are an asset to the\ncompany? Follow-ups:\n\n  * Why is that your reward system?\n  * If you could change any one thing about it, what would it be?\n\nWhat has you most worried? What keeps you up at night? A competitor? Something\nelse?\n\nWhat\u2019s one thing that\u2019s key to this company\u2019s success that somebody from\noutside the company wouldn\u2019t know about? Can help you set priorities as you\nonboard.\n\nWhat do you wish you had known when you joined this company? Can tell you a\nlot about the culture or challenges.\n\nWhat would you say are the company\u2019s strengths? Alternately, what would you\nsay are the company\u2019s weaknesses? It can be illuminating to flip these\ntraditional interview questions back on the company.\n\nWhat is the company\u2019s current strategy for generating new business? What is\nthe company\u2019s strategy for maintaining existing business? This speaks to the\nviability of the business model and is particularly useful for start-\nups/scale-ups.\n\nAre you profitable? if not, how does this affect what you can do? What's your\nplanned timeline for becoming profitable? Again, particularly useful for\nstartups. Don't ask a publicly traded company this. It will just show you\ndidn't do any research on readily available information.\n\nHow do you make money? Again, mostly for startups, but can they explain the\nbusiness model in a way that makes sense?\n\nAre company financials transparent throughout the company? What about\nsalaries? (see the DE&I section). This is another question that you probably\ndon't want to ask a publicly traded company, because the financials should be\npublic record. If you're curious, you should probably have already checked.\n\nHow much are you planning to hire in the next year? If it's a large number,\nask the follow-up: How do you plan to hire and onboard that many people?\n\nHow does the company usually solve problems: through committee, group\nmeetings, individual meetings or management only? Are they consensus-driven?\nTop-down? How well is that working for them?\n\nHow are important decisions made and communicated? How many people are\ndirectly or indirectly involved in creative decisions? Are they dictated top\ndown? Are ideas from anyone welcomed? If so, in what scope/context?\n\nHow does sales / operations / technology / marketing / finance work around\nhere? Groups other than the one you\u2019re interviewing for -- the interviewer\nshould have familiarity with those groups, and should (hopefully) speak well\nof them.\n\n## Leadership\n\nDo managers regularly hold 1:1s? What about skip levels? What sort of topics\nare discussed?\n\nWho would I directly report to? In some cases, this question can help you get\na better sense of the org chart and where you'd be on it. It can also be a\nclue on whether the org is hiring you for a specific team, or just putting you\nin a pool of new hires to be farmed out as needed.\n\nWhat\u2019s your (or my future boss\u2019) leadership style? Is that style aligned with\nwhat you're looking for in a manager?\n\nHow do you know if people are comfortable giving you candid feedback? How do\nyou fix it if they\u2019re not? Does your future manager value feedback and want to\nknow what's not working? Hopefully, this is something they've thought about.\n\nHow do you nurture psychological safety in your team? The best organizations\nhave probably spent considerable time thinking meaningfully about how they\nfoster psychological safety on their teams and can readily articulate actions\nthey've taken. Plenty of good organizations may not have thought about it in\nthose terms -- they may lack the vocabulary -- but when prompted can still\narticulate what they've done. However, if get a blank stare or dismissiveness,\neven after prompting, that can indicate a toxic or hostile environment.\n\n## Doing the work\n\nHow does work get assigned?\n\nHow often do inexperienced people get to work directly with more experienced\npeople? And how so? Pairing, or something else? How does it work?\n\nHow do you balance support and feature development?\n\nTell me about your cross-functional teams Do they have dedicated designers?\nProduct owners? QA? Technical writer? Dev manager? How cross-functional teams\nare built tells you a lot about what the company values enough to put on the\nteam.\n\nHow often do you have meetings? Are there scheduled/standing meetings? How\nmuch time should I expect to be in meetings Remember, though, that for some\npositions (especially senior positions) meetings are a core component of the\njob.\n\nWhen something goes wrong, how do you handle it?\n\nWhat kind of tools are provided by management to help an me do my job?\n(machinery, computers, office supplies, etc.)? How often is this equipment\nupdated?\n\n## Career development\n\nAre employees encouraged to go speak at conferences? Do you cover travel to\nconferences?\n\nDoes your company support continuing education? If so, how (and how much?)\n\nIn what other ways do you support career development?\n\nDoes the company routinely provide training, either internal or external, for\nnew technologies such as software updates or best practices?\n\nDoes the company allow employees to pursue their own training path To what\nextent?\n\nWhen was the last time you promoted someone on your team? How did it happen?\nHow are they likely to handle it when you want a promotion?\n\nTell me about a time you supported a direct report leaving your team or\ncompany for the benefit of their own growth? A supportive manager cares about\nyour goals, not gluing you to your seat. The very best managers realize when\nit's time to move you up, even if that means moving you out.\n\n## Performance evaluation\n\nHow is performance evaluated? What criteria does the company use for\nperformance reviews? On what cycle? Are these criteria documented? If not, how\ndo you ensure fair and equitable performance reviews?\n\nHow often can I expect job performance to be reviewed by management?\n\nAre raises based solely on job performance reviews? If not, what else is a\nfactor?\n\nDo you stack-rank employees? Can you tell me how your stack ranking process\nworks? Most times, this should be a big red flag. \"Stack ranking\" usually\nmeans the company smooshes everyone into a bell curve, and the people who find\nthemselves at the wrong end of the bell curve are now \"underperformers\" no\nmatter how great they may be. In other words, stack ranking companies may say\n\"we only hire the best\" but then they'll treat at least half of their\nemployees as under-performers, by design. Note that there are companies that\nemploy some other sorting methods they may call \"stack ranking\", so it's\nimportant to be sure you're working from the same definition.\n\nCan you tell me about a time when you've had to let someone go?\n\n## Compensation\n\nIf this is an exempt (salaried) position how much overtime do you assume I\nwould put in without compensation?\n\nIf this is an exempt (salaried) position, am I required to track all my time?\nIf so, how? And if it's not hourly, why?\n\nWhat is the salary you expect to pay for this position?\n\nIs there a company/employee bonus structure and if so, how does it work?\n\nHow often do you offer above asking? Can you speak with someone who got such\nan offer?\n\n## For engineering orgs\n\nWhat's the process for code review? How do you think about code correctness?\nBonus points if they can point to documented guidelines for behavior in code\nreviews.\n\nHow do you make sure that all code is understood by more than one person?\n\nHow do you find bugs in your team's code? Testing? Something else?\n\nWhat happens when you find a serious bug in production code? If they say this\ndoesn't happen, that's a warning sign.\n\nWho is responsible for doing deployment? How often do you deploy?\n\nIs there a written roadmap all developers can see? How far into the future\ndoes it extend? How closely is it followed?\n\nHow/when do developers talk to non-developers? How cross-functional are the\nteams? Is it easy to talk to the people who will be using your product?\n\nWhat's your approach to technical debt?\n\nDo you contribute to open source projects? Which projects? Which teams work on\nopen source? Do you work mostly in the community or do you have a private\nfork?\n\nCan I see some code the team I'm interviewing for has written? From an open-\nsource project, for example.\n\n## Things to look for in real life\n\n  * How is the office space physically organized?\n\n  * Is it clean? Well kept?\n\n  * Are employees expected to pay for basics (like coffee)?\n\nWith many thanks to all who have contributed to this list\n\n## About\n\nA big collection of useful questions to ask potential employers.\n\n### Topics\n\nculture interview\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\nActivity\n\n### Stars\n\n729 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n21 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n34 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases\n\nNo releases published\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Contributors 4\n\n  * tBaxter Carter Baxter\n  * jassingh9 Jas\n  * garrypolley Garry Polley\n  * rmoff Robin Moffatt\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
