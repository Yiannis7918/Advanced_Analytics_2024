Scared shitless of the future.\n\n\u00ab Dr. Fox and the Borg Collective\n\nA Young Squid\u2019s Illustrated Primer \u00bb\n\n28\n\nJul\n\n2015\n\n## No Brainer.\n\nFor decades now, I have been haunted by the grainy, black-and-white x-ray of a\nhuman skull.\n\nIt is alive but empty, with a cavernous fluid-filled space where the brain\nshould be. A thin layer of brain tissue lines that cavity like an amniotic\nsac. The image hails from a 1980 review article in Science: Roger Lewin, the\nauthor, reports that the patient in question had \u201cvirtually no brain\u201d. But\nthat\u2019s not what scared me; hydrocephalus is nothing new, and it takes more to\ncreep out this ex-biologist than a picture of Ventricles Gone Wild.\n\nThe stuff of nightmares. (From Oliveira et al 2012)\n\nWhat scared me was the fact that this virtually brain-free patient had an IQ\nof 126.\n\nHe had a first-class honors degree in mathematics. He presented normally along\nall social and cognitive axes. He didn\u2019t even realize there was anything wrong\nwith him until he went to the doctor for some unrelated malady, only to be\nreferred to a specialist because his head seemed a bit too large.\n\nIt happens occasionally. Someone grows up to become a construction worker or a\nschoolteacher, before learning that they should have been a rutabaga instead.\nLewin\u2019s paper reports that one out of ten hydrocephalus cases are so extreme\nthat cerebrospinal fluid fills 95% of the cranium. Anyone whose brain fits\ninto the remaining 5% should be nothing short of vegetative; yet apparently,\nfully half have IQs over 100. (Why, here\u2019s another example from 2007; and yet\nanother.) Let\u2019s call them VNBs, or \u201cVirtual No-Brainers\u201d.\n\nThe paper is titled \u201cIs Your Brain Really Necessary?\u201d, and it seems to\ncontradict pretty much everything we think we know about neurobiology. This\nForsdyke guy over in Biological Theory argues that such cases open the\npossibility that the brain might utilize some kind of extracorporeal storage,\nwhich sounds awfully woo both to me and to the anonymous neuroskeptic over at\nDiscovery.com; but even Neuroskeptic, while dismissing Forsdyke\u2019s wilder\nspeculations, doesn\u2019t really argue with the neurological facts on the ground.\n(I myself haven\u2019t yet had a chance to more than glance at the Forsdyke paper,\nwhich might warrant its own post if it turns out to be sufficiently\nsubstantive. If not, I\u2019ll probably just pretend it is and incorporate it into\nOmniscience.)\n\nOn a somewhat less peer-reviewed note, VNBs also get routinely trotted out by\nreligious nut jobs who cite them as evidence that a God-given soul must be\ndoing all those things the uppity scientists keep attributing to the brain.\nEvery now and then I see them linking to an off-hand reference I made way back\nin 2007 (apparently rifters.com is the only place to find Lewin\u2019s paper online\nwithout having to pay a wall) and I roll my eyes.\n\nAnd yet, 126 IQ. Virtually no brain. In my darkest moments of doubt, I\nwondered if they might be right.\n\nSo on and off for the past twenty years, I\u2019ve lain awake at night wondering\nhow a brain the size of a poodle\u2019s could kick my ass at advanced mathematics.\nI\u2019ve wondered if these miracle freaks might actually have the same brain mass\nas the rest of us, but squeezed into a smaller, high-density volume by the\npressure of all that cerebrospinal fluid (apparently the answer is: no). While\nI was writing Blindsight\u2014 having learned that cortical modules in the brains\nof autistic savants are relatively underconnected, forcing each to become more\nefficient\u2014 I wondered if some kind of network-isolation effect might be in\nplay.\n\nNow, it turns out the answer to that is: Maybe.\n\nThree decades after Lewin\u2019s paper, we have \u201cRevisiting hydrocephalus as a\nmodel to study brain resilience\u201d by de Oliveira et al. (actually published in\n2012, although I didn\u2019t read it until last spring). It\u2019s a \u201cMini Review\nArticle\u201d: only four pages, no new methodologies or original findings\u2014 just a\nbit of background, a hypothesis, a brief \u201cDiscussion\u201d and a conclusion calling\nfor further research. In fact, it\u2019s not so much a review as a challenge to the\nneuro community to get off its ass and study this fascinating phenomenon\u2014 so\nthat soon, hopefully, there\u2019ll be enough new research out there warrant a real\nreview.\n\nThe authors advocate research into \u201cComputational models such as the small-\nworld and scale-free network\u201d\u2014 networks whose nodes are clustered into highly-\ninterconnected \u201ccliques\u201d, while the cliques themselves are more sparsely\nconnected one to another. De Oliveira et al suggest that they hold the secret\nto the resilience of the hydrocephalic brain. Such networks result in \u201chigher\ndynamical complexity, lower wiring costs, and resilience to tissue insults.\u201d\nThis also seems reminiscent of those isolated hyper-efficient modules of\nautistic savants, which is unlikely to be a coincidence: networks from social\nto genetic to neural have all been described as \u201csmall-world\u201d. (You might\nwonder\u2014 as I did\u2014 why de Oliveira et al. would credit such networks for the\nnormal intelligence of some hydrocephalics when the same configuration is\npresumably ubiquitous in vegetative and normal brains as well. I can only\nassume they meant to suggest that small-world networking is especially well-\ndeveloped among high-functioning hydrocephalics.) (In all honesty, it\u2019s not\nthe best-written paper I\u2019ve ever read. Which seems to be kind of a trend on\nthe \u2018crawl lately.)\n\nThe point, though, is that under the right conditions, brain damage may\nparadoxically result in brain enhancement. Small-world, scale-free networking\u2014\nfocused, intensified, overclocked\u2014 might turbocharge a fragment of a brain\ninto acting like the whole thing.\n\nCan you imagine what would happen if we applied that trick to a normal brain?\n\nIf you\u2019ve read Echopraxia, you\u2019ll remember the Bicameral Order: the way they\nused tailored cancer genes to build extra connections in their brains, the way\nthey linked whole brains together into a hive mind that could rewrite the laws\nof physics in an afternoon. It was mostly bullshit, of course: neurological\nspeculation, stretched eight unpredictable decades into the future for the\nsake of a story.\n\nBut maybe the reality is simpler than the fiction. Maybe you don\u2019t have to\ntweak genes or interface brains with computers to make the next great leap in\ncognitive evolution. Right now, right here in the real world, the cognitive\nfunction of brain tissue can be boosted\u2014 without engineering, without\naugmentation\u2014 by literal orders of magnitude. All it takes, apparently, is the\nright kind of stress. And if the neuroscience community heeds de Oliveira et\nal\u2018s clarion call, we may soon know how to apply that stress to order. The\nsingularity might be a lot closer than we think.\n\nAlso a lot squishier.\n\nWouldn\u2019t it be awesome if things turned out to be that easy?\n\nThis entry was posted on Tuesday, July 28th, 2015 at 7:05 am and is filed\nunder blindsight, neuro, Omniscience, sentience/cognition.

Regular\nhydrocephaly might take away as much as the stress/damage/resilience response\ngives, leaving them net normal, but if there is such a response, then it\nshould sometimes be accidentally triggered on its own, in the same way that\nother repair processes (like bone growth) sometimes get triggered when they\nshouldn\u2019t, making for a few people who get all the upside and none of the\ndownside.\n\nIf net brain performance could be boosted by one order of magnitude, or even\njust doubled (compare humans with ~100b neurons to creatures with 50b\nneurons), they would be as gods unto men.

Brains are metabolically expensive.\n\nDepends on a couple of things. If the malady\u2019s congenital, then the net\nbenefit to the small fraction of hydrocephalics who are functional VNBs would\nhave to outweigh the deleterious effects imposed on the greater hydrocephalic\npopulation (effects that include a shitload of nasty diseases in addition to\nthe usual impacts of retardation, blindness, and convulsions inflicted\ndirectly by the condition, according to Wikipedia).\n\nAnd of course, if the malady\u2019s developmental, then there\u2019s no gene to spread.\n\nGuest\n\nTrottelreiner\n\n8 years ago\n\nFirst of, do we really know there are no cognitive defecits? Something that\nmight not show up on an test for g, whatever that is, but maybe on some test\nfor spatial orientation, motor coordination, attention shifting or episodic\nmemory? Knowing some mathematicians, deficits in those are not necessarily\ndetrimental for mathematics. It might also be interesting how many social\ninteractions they have, since there is some correlation between the size of\nsome brain structures and group size in primates, e.g. Dunbar\u2019s number.\n\nSecond of, it might be the parts least affected are the ones at the surface,\ne.g. the cortex, so maybe it\u2019s just the deeper areas missing. So viewing etc.\nusually just work normal, but the deeper areas that just play in with\nblinsight etc. are missing. Seems still somewhat strange, but evolution is\nsomewhat conservative, and if e.g. said older structures are needed in early\ndevelopment, but not later on, selection would keep them.\n\nThird of, usually half your brain is occupied with shouting the other half\ndown, so maybe it\u2019s an reallocation of resources.\n\nAnd last but not least, maybe it\u2019s not so much neuron volume but surface area\nthat is important for cognition, which might not be that much changed in those\nsubjects.\n\nStill somewhat strange, though...\n\nGuest\n\nEric\n\n8 years ago\n\n> And of course, if the malady\u2019s developmental, then there\u2019s no gene to\n> spread.\n\nThe point isn\u2019t that hydrocephaly itself would be selected for, rather that if\nall that brain matter isn\u2019t actually needed, then why are so many humans\nspending 20% of their energy on a mostly useless organ \u2013 not to mention the\nselection pressure of mothers not dying in childbirth that would come from\nsmaller heads. There are so many negative effects of the larger brain/head\nthat there must have been some immense selection pressure for more brain\nmatter to even get to this point. That pressure seems to be strongly at odds\nwith the claim that a human can be normal with only 5% of the tissue.\n\nGuest\n\nHugh\n\n8 years ago\n\nDid some computational science (AKA a quick Python script) on volumes of\nnormal brains compared to these \u201cshell\u201d brains.\n\nHead circumference in cm seems to be the most common measurement used, with\nCanadian adults averaging 55-57cm according to Wikipedia.\n\nIf the \u201cshell\u201d brain is 1cm thick, then at 65cm circumference it would be\nroughly the same volume as a 43cm circumference normal brain. These are both\noutside the average range, but are they excessively so? Are there no examples\nof people with below average brain volumes having an IQ of 126?\n\nHas anyone tried measuring the reflexes of VNBs rather than IQ? Would sending\nsignals around the circumference rather than through the interior be\nmeasurably slower?\n\nGuest\n\nScott P.\n\n8 years ago\n\n\u201cAre there no examples of people with below average brain volumes having an IQ\nof 126?\u201d\n\nGuinness lists (or used to) Anatole France as having the smallest documented\nbrain for a human.\n\nGuest\n\nNathanael\n\n8 years ago\n\nMost of our brain is simply spares, basically. Spares are really really\nimportant. Stuff breaks a lot.\n\nMy grandmother was an old yogi, trained from a fairly young age. She had a\nstroke and lost the ability to speak. Part of her brain (one of the language\ncenters) was blacked out, permanently gone, never lit up again. She taught\nherself how to speak again, using a different part of her brain. Had another\nstroke, lost the ability to speak again, permanently lost another section of\nher brain. She taught herself how to speak again, using a different part of\nher brain.\n\nThe standard \u201cmap\u201d of what is processed in what part of the brain is just an\naverage. For any given feature, there\u2019s a fairly large percentage of people\nwho are wired completely differently \u2014 a different part of the brain performs\nthe function which Broca\u2019s area performs in average people. Et cetera. This is\njust known science. Brain tissue is exceptionally plastic, and can be used for\na lot of purposes.\n\nHaving spares seems really really useful.\n\nGuest\n\nNathanael\n\n8 years ago\n\nAlso, remember that old claim that people only used a small fraction of their\nbrains? The missing statement there was \u201cat any one time\u201d \u2014 it all gets used,\ngenerally, but not all at *once*. Perhaps you can\u2019t overclock the brain\nbecause it\u2019ll overheat. Maybe you can run everything on a small, tight brain\nnetwork (with sufficient cooling). But arguably it\u2019s better to only wake up a\nfew smaller sections at a time and let them cool down in between thoughts,\nwhich is roughly what we seem to actually do. Do these functional\nhydrocephalics die younger than average?\n\nGuest\n\nJason\n\n8 years ago\n\n> The point, though, is that under the right conditions, brain damage may\n> paradoxically result in brain enhancement.

Naturally, the absence of\ngyri and sulci is part of lissencephaly as a condition, but one has to wonder.\n\nI hope the patient has a hippocampus......somewhere. *shudder*\n\nGuest\n\nwhoever\n\n8 years ago\n\nKurzweil\u2019s *How to Create a Mind* does talk about redundant clusters as a form\nof backup, especially for memory.

Would\n> sending signals around the circumference rather than through the interior be\n> measurably slower?\n\nI wouldn\u2019t care so much about reflexes, of which quite a few are in the brain\nstem or even the spinal chord. It also depends somewhat which structures are\nspared; as already mentioned, it seems like the hindbrain (rhombencephalon) is\noften relatively unaffected, which might indicate they use some\nphylogenetically older structures for apei, err, lizarding human behaviour.\nThough being myself somewhat on the autism spectrum [1], I wonder how\neffective that would be. BTW, they would not necessarily be P zombies, since\nthere would be quite some other differences beside self consciousness. Hm,\nremind me to do a WADA test to know what it\u2019s like to switch of brain areas...\n\nAlso, if the damage goes from the in- to the outside, it could be the outer\nareas are less affected. Now humans differ from chimps not just in brain\nvolume, but also in the, err, invagination of the brain tissue,\n\nwhich might indicate whatever makes us superior in some (but not all) areas\n(AFAIR chimps have better memory, inter alias) has more to do with surface\narea than with volume. Maybe associative networks work best in 2D or limited\n3D, or whatever. And just getting rid of much of the deeper structures might\nnot damage those that much, but that would raise the question why evolution\nkept the underlying structures in the first place. So it would be quite\ninteresting to search for subtle differences, e.g. more concrete thinking in\nsome areas.\n\nOTOH, it might be that the surface areas are more damaged, though that would\nraise the opposite question, e.g. why the deep sulci.\n\nAlso, maybe the kind of work the brain does is subject to some strange work\nrequirements,\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity\n\nand it takes relatively little to get work done relatively well, e.g. touching\nyour nose. to get a somewhat more precise result, though, e.g. touching the\ntip of your nose, which is maybe 10 times as precise, you might not need 10\ntimes the time or number of processors, but 100 times.

But when you have problems learning math\nor a new language, could this task really become easier with more connections?\nInstead of asking why it is easy for some people to learn these things, maybe\none could also ask why it is so difficult for others who have a perfectly\nhealthy, normal brain.\n\nAn old myth is that we only use 10% of our brain. But how efficient could it\nbecome if the neurons were more connected?\n\nStuart Hameroff and Roger Penrose have been arguing for long now that the\nimportant stuff happens in the microtubule, and the neurons and glial cells\nare just specialized cells that connects all microtubule processes in each\nindividual cell with each other.

When you look at a tiny nematode finding its way around in\na pond, and looks at a large ciliate about the same size as the nematode, has\nthe multicellular worm mental qualities that place it higher than the protist?\nThey can sense the environment, orient themselves, try other solutions when\nthey meet obstacles, speed up to chase a prey or escape danger, mate and show\nsimilar behavior in general. Are the nematodes in any way better than the\nsimilar sized protists in this? Faster reactions, better memory or something\nelse?

As we know, the\nvast majority of brain cells within the cerebrum is in the cortex. The cortex\nis clearly intact in this man with hydracephalus. The rest of the space is\nwhite matter that composes of axon fibers. What this case probably\ndemonstrates is that the axon fibers in the white matter can condense\ntremendously under the pressure of hydrocephalus and still function. Clearly\nknowledge is known to be stored in the brain as you can lose it by suffering\nbrain trauma or stroke.

Myopia\ncorrelates with high intelligence. Is compensation a factor in enhancing\ncognition? High IQ + low vestibular function is another thing I\u2019ve noticed\noccurring together (anecdotally.) Potentially interesting.\n\nGuest\n\nTimothy Gawne\n\n8 years ago\n\nVery interesting. However, there are a few issues that many people forget\nabout.\n\nFirst, consider Moravec\u2019s paradox: what seems easy is hard, and what seems\nhard is easy. In principle \u2018higher math\u2019 could be done with very little brain\ntissue \u2013 it just seems hard to most of us, because it\u2019s not what our brains\nevolved for (like using a jumbo jet to travel down the street to the grocery\nstore). If this patient grew up with this condition he might have a \u2018savant\nlike\u2019 efficient wiring for math.\n\nThe other issue is that we evolved to compete and win, but there are\ndiminishing returns. For example: suppose that in order to run 5% faster, you\nneed 50% more muscle mass (I made this up). In the wild the person that runs\n5% faster eats and the other person does not eat and dies. However, they can\nstill run at 95% of the speed with half the muscle mass. From that perspective\nit might seem like 50% of your muscles are useless, but not really.\n\nConsider vision. Each eye has about 1 million nerve fibers connecting it to\nthe rest of the brain. However, this is massively overkill for most tasks. You\ncan lose almost all of your retinal nerve fibers through glaucoma and still\nread, drive a car etc. That doesn\u2019t mean those million fibers are useless. In\na winner-take-all competition, the person with a million fibers per eye will\nlikely beat out the person with only 100,000 fibers per eye. But the person\nwith 100,000 fibers would still appear to function almost normally for non-\ncompetitive simple functional tasks.\n\nI mean, compare a 2 megapixel camera with a 25 megapixel camera. You can still\nsee basic objects with the 2 megapixel one, right? But if you are hawk\nsearching for rabbits, you want the 25 megapixel equivalent.\n\nIt\u2019s not that most of the brain is useless. it\u2019s that the human brain is a\nbleeding-edge combat system designed for maximal performance. It can still\nwork pretty good with only a fraction of the neurons, though, as long as the\ndamage is not all at once and doesn\u2019t cut the major connecting paths or the\nvital subcortical nuclei.\n\nGuest\n\nTimothy Gawne\n\n8 years ago\n\nOh sorry, just had another idea.\n\nIt does suggest that if we were willing to settle for slightly (maybe just\nSLIGHTLY) lower levels of performance in things like visual acuity and\ncoordination etc., we might be able to free up maybe half the cerebral cortex\nor more for other tasks, for which we presently have no ability at all.\nProbably hard/impossible to do once you are grown up, but maybe during\ndevelopment? Force the normal brain functions into a restricted space \u2013 the\nperson likely won\u2019t grow up to be a major league baseball player but they will\nstill be able to do normal tasks (drive, read, etc.) fine.

Then I pondered a bit\nfarther and decided that if I was, it could explain a lot about me, and also\ndecided that if I was a p-zombie I\u2019d probably rather not know since there\nprobably wouldn\u2019t be anything anyone could do about it that didn\u2019t involve\nviolence or sequestration.\n\nBut back to the search for relevance: I had often wondered about the source of\nthe old saw \u201cpeople don\u2019t even use but about 10 or 20 percent of their brain\u201d.\nReading this article and the comments, it looks like maybe 80 to 90 percent of\nthe \u201cnormal\u201d brain mass is missing from these well-adapted survivors of\nhydrocephalus. I don\u2019t know how far back in the history of neurology/medicine\nthis phenomenon has been observed, but the old saw seems to fit, so to speak,\nbut it seems to perhaps be an unreasonable generalization from extreme\nexamples. One does wonder what might be the function of all of the\n\u201cextraneous\u201d tissue without which these people seem to be able to function on\na level considered to be at least normal.\n\nI would propose that the \u201cextraneous\u201d tissues are a reserve against trauma.\nThere are some classics of the field such as various head-trauma cases in\nmilitary medicine, where someone pretty much loses half a brain and has a\nmiraculous recovery months or years later, regaining most of their previous\ncapacities practically overnight (a year later), but now they are left-handed\ninstead of right-handed. There are the folks who get half of their brain\nanaesthetized and we see the emergence of different personalities which\ndisappear as the anaesthesia subsides. There are the fairly rare cases of\npeople who get a bang on the head and they\u2019re perfectly functional aside from\nnot knowing who they are or much else that\u2019s personal to their own lives. The\nastonishing thing is that despite trauma that we might expect to permanently\ncripple, recovery may be more common than not, for some values of \u201ccomplete\u201d\nin recovery.\n\nI can\u2019t think of many ways to test this theory which wouldn\u2019t be totally out\nof ethical bounds, but perhaps however well these people may seem to live\nnormal and competent lives having lost a great deal of brain mass to\nhydrocephalus, they might have almost no hope of recovery following additional\nbrain trauma, because there\u2019s just no tissue there to be re-purposed by\nplasticity of the brain. Leaving out of the discussion that these people are\nin their condition as the result of a technological intervention, we might\nthink that there might be some evolutionary value in having all of the\ncapability of a \u201cnormal\u201d using only 20 percent of the brain mass, but in the\npre-technical world in which we all evolved, it might be far more valuable to\nhave a reserve left idle against the likelihood of needing it for trauma\nrecovery. In a social animal such as primates, which also might be thought\nmore likely than most to suffer brain traumas as a result of falling out of\ntrees, such a reserve might actually be likely to get a chance to be used, and\nmight likely be conserved in the gene pool if recovered specimens went on to\nsuccessfully reproduce. That normal function is possible after technical\nintervention in hydrocephalus, that\u2019s just serendipity. But if you were trying\nto write a story about specially bred/engineered hominids designed for\n\u201cnormal\u201d mental function in extreme environments (military etc) you would\nprobably have to throw in some bit about any specimen\u2019s fellows instantly\nabandoning their members who had any significant cranial damage, as almost\nincapable of recovery to anything like \u201cnormal\u201d.\n\nI guess a good question here might be \u201cbut how could we use imaging techniques\nto discern in healthy brains, what might be \u201cdaily use\u201d brain tissues, from\n\u201cidle in reserve\u201d tissues? Maybe there\u2019s some indicator that tuning to task or\nfunction hasn\u2019t occurred yet?

(The famous shorthand is that\ngenes are not a blueprint, but a recipe.)\n\nDon\u2019t know if that leads to the conclusion that most of the brain s useless,\nthough. The brain is a big glucose hog; there\u2019d be strong selection pressure\nto reduce that cost if it didn\u2019t carry it\u2019s weight somehow. Of course, no\nmatter how strong the selection pressure, nothing happens until you get a\nfavorable mutation that lets you start down that road\u2014 but there\u2019s so much\nbrainular variability throughout the animal kingdom that I gotta think such a\nmutation would have happened by now.\n\n> Trottelreiner: To play devil\u2019s advocate for the mammal in gasform folks,\n> what if the brain is just a receiver, and the stroke just shuts down part of\n> the antenna array or some other part of the damn radio?\n\nActually, I think that might be one of the claims Penrose and Hameroff are\nmaking..\n\nAuthor\n\nPeter Watts\n\n8 years ago\n\n> Merkator: As a fan of yours, I would like to ask you a question.

For the past solid year.\n\n\u2022 The East Antarctic Plateau just hit 38.5\u00b0C above its seasonal average. In\nrelated news, emperor penguin colonies are collapsing.\n\nMarch \u201924\n\n\u2022 2023 was 0.2\u00b0C higher than expected and no one knows why.

Let\u2019s just ignore that Nature paper that says it could happen as soon\nas 2025...\n\n\u2022 New \u201cCategory 6\u201d hurricane proposed. Because hurricanes are way stronger now\nthan they were in the old days.\n\nJanuary \u201924\n\n\u2022 Air pollution from Alberta Tar Sands 1,900-6,300% higher than previously\nreported. Meaning the tar sands emit as much air pollution as all other\nCanadian sources combined.\n\n\u2022 Greenland losing thirty million tones of ice per hour, 20% more than\npreviously thought. Another nail in AMOC\u2018s coffin.\n\n\u2022 Norwegian government approves deep-sea mining. I\u2019ve spoken to a couple of\nNorwegian scientists who think this is a very bad idea.

On the up side,\nthat means they\u2019ll outlast civilization itself by a good two decades.\n\n\u2022 Number of species in danger of extinction doubles to two million. Personally\nI bet that\u2019s extremely conservative; we don\u2019t even know how many species are\nout there in the first place.\n\n\u2022 World\u2019s governments plan to produce more than twice the 1.5\u00b0C-limit for\nfossil fuels by 2030.
