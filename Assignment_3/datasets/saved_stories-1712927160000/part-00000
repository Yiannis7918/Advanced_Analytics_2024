Popular AI images boosted through\nsponsored posts on Hokage Modi Sama feature Modi as a reincarnation of\nBhishma, a suit-wearing son of god, embracing Hindu heritage and the King of\nHindu Rashtra settled on his throne, garnering millions of likes and views.\n(Hindu Rashtra is the contentious ideology of a Hindu-majoritarian rule of\nIndia, a move away from its secular founding principle.)\n\n\u201cThrough these images, the attempt appears to be to impart a simultaneous\nsage-like and warrior-like quality to Modi, both of which create the aura of a\npolitical leader who is indefatigable, undefeatable, beyond reproach and thus\nworthy of our unquestioned loyalty,\u201d Amogh Dar Sharma, a lecturer at the\nUniversity of Oxford who studies political communications, told Al Jazeera.\n\nBut the posts by the most prolific online advertiser of Modi\u2019s AI images also\nshow the challenges with enforcing AI-related rules on social media, amid\nfears of manipulated images being leveraged for propaganda among voters who\nmight not fully understand the extent of alteration that photos and memes\ncould have gone through.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeta is aware of such use and before a crucial 2024 election year, it\nannounced that starting January, political advertisements on Instagram and\nFacebook created using artificial intelligence (AI) will have to disclose the\nuse or risk getting banned.\n\n### Sign up for Al Jazeera\n\n#### Weekly Newsletter\n\nprotected by reCAPTCHA\n\nIn the 30 days leading up to March 29, Hokage Modi Sama spent 537,799 Indian\nrupees ($6,500) to boost 363 pieces of political content, including images and\nvideos on its Instagram page, according to Meta Ad Library data. Our analysis\nshows that nearly 14 percent of all sponsored advertisements, amounting to 50\nimages, were AI-generated.\n\nAll Hokage Modi Sama AI ads were sponsored posts on Instagram and the\ndisclosure of AI\u2019s use was through hashtags such as #aiartwork,\n#midjourneyart, #midjourneyai and others. Midjourney, which the hashtags\nappear to refer to, is a popular generative artificial intelligence program.\n\nBut Meta told Al Jazeera that hashtags are not an acceptable disclosure for an\nadvertisement which is digitally created or altered. In cases where\nadvertisers need to disclose that their content is digitally created or\naltered, Meta will add a label that says \u201cDigitally created\u201d near the \u201cPaid\nfor by\u201d disclaimer, including in the Ad Library. Such labels are currently not\npresent on Hokage Modi Sama AI advertisements.\n\nMeta did not answer Al Jazeera\u2019s specific question on whether the\nphotorealistic images advertisements of Modi violated its policy of depicting\na real person doing something they did not, or depicting a realistic-looking\nevent that did not happen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, Meta pointed Al Jazeera\u2019s reporter to a blog post from March 2024 on\nAI disclosure requirements for advertisers and how the company is preparing\nfor the Indian elections.\n\nPrateek Waghre, the executive director of the India-based Internet Freedom\nFoundation (IFF), told Al Jazeera that since these particular advertisements\nare tagged as #aiart, there is a need for content creators to acknowledge the\nattempt at boosting AI images through some form of disclosure to comply with\nMeta\u2019s recently updated policies requiring AI disclosure.\n\n## AI used to push \u2018strategic narratives\u2019\n\nIndian election campaigns have been a vehicle for a slow diffusion of AI-\ngenerated images and videos, including through AI resurrections of dead\npolitical leaders, and their use as campaign art in official party accounts,\nas Al Jazeera reported earlier. Despite the threat of AI-generated election\nmisinformation, deepfakes aren\u2019t being exclusively used to deceive voters.\nInstead, generative AI is being co-opted to build a narrative.\n\n\u201cWhile disinformation is definitely a serious problem that requires our\nattention, it also deflects attention from the more subliminal ways in which\nAI-generated content can help push strategic narratives of political parties,\u201d\nSharma of Oxford University told Al Jazeera, after reviewing the AI image\nadvertisements.\n\n\u201cIt is not simply that AI is \u2018deceiving\u2019 voters into believing something that\nis blatantly false; rather, AI enables content to be produced that is more\ncreative and that can draw upon more innovative cultural references \u2013 this\nyields political propaganda which is more entertaining and therefore more\nshareable, which enables widespread circulation\u201d he added.\n\nFor instance, the most popular AI image posted by the Hokage Modi Sama page is\nthe \u201cOur Saffron Superhero\u201d. It shows Modi wearing saffron kurta pyjamas, with\na flowing cape walking beneath the \u201cOm\u201d flag, a Hindu spiritual symbol. The AI\nimage has nearly two million likes with comments such as, \u201cWho wants India to\nbe a Hindu nation?\u201d in the comments section on Instagram. Most images recast\nthe Indian prime minister as a \u201csaviour\u201d, \u201csaffron-clad guardian of India\u2019s\nfuture\u201d, \u201csymbol of Hindu renaissance\u201d and more.\n\nSharma pointed out that while mythologising political leaders or featuring\nthem in Hindu epics is not new, AI is allowing it to be executed with greater\nfinesse.\n\n\u201cThese AI-generated images of Narendra Modi seem to be the latest iteration in\na long-running strategy of the BJP to create a cult about [Modi] as a wise and\nsagacious leader,\u201d Sharma said.\n\nWhile the Instagram and Facebook pages of Hokage Modi Sama do not have\nexplicit disclaimers on a direct affiliation to Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party\n(BJP), the page has a history of publishing pro-Hindutva and pro-BJP content.\nPreviously, the page had gained traction after sharing an image of social\nmedia platform X\u2019s owner Elon Musk as a Hindu monk, with the caption, \u201cOur\nfellow bhakt Elon\u201d, denoting Musk as a Hindu nationalist.\n\nMultiple attempts to contact the administrator of Hokage Modi Sama were\nunsuccessful. In the anime Naruto, \u201cHokage\u201d is a prestigious title bestowed on\na village leader, while Sama is a respectful way to say \u201csir\u201d in Japanese, so\nthe page roughly means \u201cLeader Modi Sir\u201d. The Instagram handle with 130,000\nfollowers now sells merchandise such as T-shirts, coffee mugs and diaries\nbased on the saffron superhero AI image.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGlobally, AI images have been used in political campaigns. In March,\nsupporters of United States presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s campaign\nused fake AI images of him posing with Black voters for \u201cstrategic outreach\u201d\nto the Black community. In Argentina, two presidential hopefuls used AI-\ngenerated images to boost their popularity and attack opponents. And in\nIndonesia, President-elect Prabowo Subianto, the once-feared military\ndictator, used AI images to rebrand himself as a \u201ccuddly grandpa\u201d on his\ncampaign trail.\n\nIn India, in the run-up to the Telangana state elections in December 2023,\nfact-checking outlet BOOM Live reported that AI images falsely portrayed\nregional political leader K Chandrashekar Rao at the launch of a free meals\nscheme for students, which he never attended.\n\nAn Al Jazeera review of the Meta Ad Library from December 2023 revealed that\nthe page Mana Telangana shared multiple fake AI images on Instagram and\nFacebook of Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi of the Congress Party posing\nwith children and farmers. Farmers constitute an influential voting block in\nIndia and have frequently protested against Modi\u2019s market-friendly agriculture\nlaws.\n\nThere are multiple fake AI images on Instagram and Facebook of Indian\nopposition leader Rahul Gandhi of the Congress Party [File: Altaf\nHussain/Reuters]\n\nGandhi\u2019s fake image with farmers was accompanied by the caption: \u201cRahul Gandhi\nempathizes with farmers, promising unwavering support and a commitment to\naddressing their concerns individually.\u201d The sponsored post contained the\nhashtags #aigenerated and #aiimages, indicating they were AI-generated, and\nhad an estimated 7,000 impressions.\n\n## West vs Global South\n\nThere is also a disparity in the way platforms in the West and the Global\nSouth are tackling the trend of AI images ahead of elections.\n\nFor instance, to mitigate the potential abuse of AI images ahead of the\nNovember US presidential elections, popular AI image-generator Midjourney\nbanned the creation of fake President Joe Biden and Donald Trump images in\nMarch.\n\nBut there have been no such steps in India, raising \u201cconcern regarding the\nequitable enforcement of policies by tech platforms across different regions\u201d,\nBaybars Orsek, the managing director of Logically Facts, told Al Jazeera.\nLogically Facts is part of Meta\u2019s third-party fact-checking programme and part\nof the misinformation combat alliance in India.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAttempts by Al Jazeera to generate AI images on Midjourney of Modi and Gandhi\nshaking hands were successful, while the prompt to generate an image of Modi\nand Trump shaking hands resulted in a \u201cBanned Prompt Detected\u201d notification.\n\n\u201cThis decision brings to light the disparities in how such moderation policies\nare applied globally, especially in the context of the Global South, including\ncountries like India, which is heading into the most significant election of\nthe year,\u201d Orsek said.\n\nAl Jazeera emailed Midjourney about the disparity in moderation and is yet to\nhear back.\n\nIt is similar to how social media companies such as Facebook or Twitter\npolicies to keep their platforms safe are skewed towards the West and often\nneglect perspectives from the Global South, added the IFF\u2019s Waghre.\n\nSource: Al Jazeera\n\n  *     * About Us\n    * Code of Ethics\n    * Terms and Conditions\n    * EU/EEA Regulatory Notice\n    * Privacy Policy\n    * Cookie Policy\n    * Cookie PreferencesManage preferences\n    * Sitemap\n    * Work for us\n    * HR Quality\n\n  *     * Contact Us\n    * User Accounts Help\n    * Advertise with us\n    * Apps\n    * Newsletters\n    * Channel Finder\n    * TV Schedule\n    * Podcasts\n    * Submit a Tip\n\n  *     * Al Jazeera Arabic\n    * Al Jazeera English\n    * Al Jazeera Investigative Unit\n    * Al Jazeera Mubasher\n    * Al Jazeera Documentary\n    * Al Jazeera Balkans\n    * AJ+\n\n  *     * Al Jazeera Centre for Studies\n    * Al Jazeera Media Institute\n    * Learn Arabic\n    * Al Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human Rights\n    * Al Jazeera Forum\n    * Al Jazeera Hotel Partners\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:\n\n\u00a9 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\n## You rely on Al Jazeera for truth and transparency\n\nWe and our 816 partners store and access information on your device, such as\nunique IDs in cookies to process personal data.
