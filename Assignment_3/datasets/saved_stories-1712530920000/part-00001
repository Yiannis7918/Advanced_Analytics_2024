(DARPA)\n\nHave you ever wondered if that video you're watching, the photo you're looking\nat, or even that person on the other line is the real deal?\n\nDeepfakes aren't just Hollywood magic anymore\u2014they're part of our everyday\nlives, found in everything from the news we consume to the memes we share.\nDuring this panel, experts dive into the world of deepfakes to break down the\nimpacts of digital deception and what we can do about it. Industry,\ngovernment, and academic leaders discussed how new analytical tools \u2014\nincluding those developed by DARPA's Semantic Forensics program \u2014 can help\norganizations and individuals protect themselves against manipulated media.\n\nSpeakers included:\n\n  * Donie O'Sullivan (moderator), Politics and Technology Correspondent, CNN\n  * Wil Corvey, Semantic Forensics Program Manager, DARPA\n  * Matt Turek, Deputy Director, Information Innovation Office, DARPA\n  * Nick Dufour, Misinformation Mitigation Researcher, Google\n  * Amruta Deshpande, Senior Research Scientist, Graphika\n  * James Verbus, Senior Staff Machine Learning Engineer, LinkedIn\n\nDARPA recently announced its analytic catalog of open-source resources\ndeveloped under SemaFor for use by researchers and industry. As capabilities\nmature and become available, they will be added to this repository.\n\nThe agency also launched the AI Forensics Open Research Challenge Evaluation\n(AI FORCE). This open community research effort invites participants to\ncontribute their expertise in developing innovative and robust machine\nlearning, or deep learning, models that can accurately detect synthetic AI-\ngenerated images. Through a series of mini challenges, AI FORCE asks\nparticipants to build models that can discern between authentic images,\nincluding ones that may have been manipulated or edited using non-AI methods,\nand fully synthetic AI-generated images.\n\nFor more information on the above efforts and resources, visit\nhttps://semanticforensics.com/.\n\n## Tags\n\n| Analytics | Artificial Intelligence | Trust |\n\n## Similarly Tagged Content\n\nDeepfake Defense Tech Ready for Commercialization, Transition  \n---  \nVoices from DARPA Podcast Episode 69: Demystifying Deepfakes  \nDARPA Announces Research Teams Selected to Semantic Forensics Program  \nUncovering the Who, Why, and How Behind Manipulated Media  \nExplainable Artificial Intelligence  \n  \n## Images\n\n## Resources\n\n## Contacts\n\n  * Print\n\n## Selected DARPA Achievements\n\nDARPA\u2019s Stealth Revolution\n\nIn the early days of DARPA\u2019s work on stealth technology, Have Blue, a\nprototype of what would become the F-117A, first flew successfully in 1977.\nThe success of the F-117A program marked the beginning of the stealth\nrevolution, which has had enormous benefits for national security.\n\nNavigation in the Palm of Your Hand\n\nEarly GPS receivers were bulky, heavy devices. In 1983, DARPA set out to\nminiaturize them, leading to a much broader adoption of GPS capability.\n\nPaving the Way to the Modern Internet\n\nARPA research played a central role in launching the Information Revolution.\nThe agency developed and furthered much of the conceptual basis for the\nARPANET\u2014prototypical communications network launched nearly half a century\nago\u2014and invented the digital protocols that gave birth to the Internet.\n\n  * About Us\n  * About DARPA\n  * People\n  * Offices\n  * Innovation Timeline\n  * Testimony\n  * Budget and Finance\n  * History list page\n  * Image Gallery\n\n  * Our Research\n  * Coronavirus: DARPA Response\n  * Ethical Legal Societal Implications of Research\n  * Fundamental Research: Seeds of Surprise\n  * Voices from DARPA\n  * Our Programs\n\n  * News\n\n  * Events\n\n  * Work With Us\n  * Opportunities\n  * DARPAConnect\n  * DARPA Innovation Fellowship\n  * New Program Managers\n  * Contract Management\n  * Public Release\n  * For Industry\n  * For Small Businesses\n  * For Universities\n  * For Government and Military\n  * DARPA Toolbox Initiative\n  * Employment at DARPA\n\n  * Site Info\n  * Sitemap\n  * Cookie Disclaimer\n\n  * Web Policy\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Accessibility/Section 508\n  * No Fear Act\n  * Whistleblower Protection Act\n  * Usage Policy\n  * DoD Hotline\n\n  * USA.gov\n  * /\n  * Freedom of Information Act\n  * /\n  * Privacy and Civil Liberties\n  * /\n  * Visitor Information\n  * /\n  * Contact Us\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * Linked In\n  * RSS\n\nDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency 675 North Randolph Street Arlington,\nVA 22203-2114 703.526.6630\n\nThis is an official U.S. Department of Defense website sponsored by the\nDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency.\n\nYou are now leaving the DARPA.mil website that is under the control and\nmanagement of DARPA.
