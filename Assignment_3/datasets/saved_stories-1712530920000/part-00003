Securing Canada\u2019s AI advantage\n\nGo to the translated article\n\nApril 7, 2024\n\nMontr\u00e9al, Quebec\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has incredible potential to transform the\neconomy, improve the way we work, and enhance our way of life. The global race\nto scale up and adopt AI is on, and Canada is at the forefront of this\ntechnology. To make sure we can seize every opportunity in the economy of the\nfuture, and set every generation up for success, we need to scale up our\ninnovation ambitions. And do it in a way that brings everyone along. For\nMillennials and Gen Z, who feel their hard work isn\u2019t paying off like it did\nfor previous generations, we must invest in good-paying opportunities that\nhelp them get ahead. That\u2019s why we\u2019re focused on creating more good jobs,\nincluding in innovation and technology, which are among the highest paying of\nall industries.\n\nAI is already unlocking massive growth in industries across the economy. Many\nCanadians are already feeling the benefits of using AI to work smarter and\nfaster. The rapid advance of generative AI today will unlock immense economic\npotential for Canada, significantly improving productivity and reducing the\ntime workers have to spend on repetitive tasks. Researchers and companies in\nCanada are also using AI to create incredible new innovations and job\nopportunities across all facets of the Canadian economy, from drug discovery\nto energy efficiency to housing innovation. In the past year, job growth in AI\nincreased by nearly one third in Canada \u2013 among the highest growth of any\nsector. And most AI jobs pay well above the average income.\n\nCanada has a world-leading AI ecosystem \u2013 from development, to\ncommercialization, to safety. We have an advantage that can make sure Canadian\nvalues and Canadian ideas help shape this globally in-demand technology.\nCanada was the first country in the world to introduce a national AI strategy\nand has invested over $2 billion since 2017 to support AI and digital research\nand innovation. Since then, countries around the world have begun investing\nsignificant funding and efforts into AI to advance their economies,\nparticularly in computing infrastructure. In order to maintain Canada\u2019s\ncompetitive edge, and secure good paying jobs and job security for generations\nof young Canadians, we must raise the bar.\n\nThe Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, today announced a $2.4 billion package of\nmeasures from the upcoming Budget 2024 to secure Canada\u2019s AI advantage. These\ninvestments will accelerate job growth in Canada\u2019s AI sector and beyond, boost\nproductivity by helping researchers and businesses develop and adopt AI, and\nensure this is done responsibly.\n\nThese measures include:\n\n  * Investing $2 billion to build and provide access to computing capabilities and technological infrastructure for Canada\u2019s world-leading AI researchers, start-ups, and scale-ups. As part of this investment, we will soon be consulting with AI stakeholders to inform the launch of a new AI Compute Access Fund to provide near-term support to researchers and industry. We will also develop a new Canadian AI Sovereign Compute Strategy to catalyze the development of Canadian-owned and located AI infrastructure. Ensuring access to cutting-edge computing infrastructure will attract more global AI investment to Canada, develop and recruit the best talent, and help Canadian businesses compete and succeed on the world stage.\n  * Boosting AI start-ups to bring new technologies to market, and accelerating AI adoption in critical sectors, such as agriculture, clean technology, health care, and manufacturing, with $200 million in support through Canada\u2019s Regional Development Agencies.\n  * Investing $100 million in the NRC IRAP AI Assist Program to help small and medium-sized businesses scale up and increase productivity by building and deploying new AI solutions. This will help companies incorporate AI into their businesses and take on research, product development, testing, and validation work for new AI-based solutions.\n  * Supporting workers who may be impacted by AI, such as creative industries, with $50 million for the Sectoral Workforce Solutions Program, which will provide new skills training for workers in potentially disrupted sectors and communities.\n  * Creating a new Canadian AI Safety Institute, with $50 million to further the safe development and deployment of AI. The Institute, which will leverage input from stakeholders and work in coordination with international partners, will help Canada better understand and protect against the risks of advanced or nefarious AI systems, including to specific communities.\n  * Strengthening enforcement of the Artificial Intelligence and Data Act, with $5.1 million for the Office of the AI and Data Commissioner. The proposed Act aims to guide AI innovation in a positive direction to help ensure Canadians are protected from potential risks by ensuring the responsible adoption of AI by Canadian businesses.\n\nToday\u2019s announcement is about investing in innovation and economic growth to\nsecure Canada\u2019s world-leading AI advantage today and for generations to come.\nThis will create good-paying opportunities for every generation, boost\ninnovation across the economy, raise productivity, and accelerate economic\ngrowth \u2013 and it\u2019s just one of the things that we are going to be doing in\nBudget 2024. Alongside these measures, we\u2019re building more homes faster,\nensuring every kid has the food they need, investing in health care, making\nlife more affordable, and creating good jobs to make sure every generation can\nget ahead.\n\n## Quotes\n\n> \u201cAI has the potential to transform the economy.
