Questions Arise Over The Future Of x86-64 Micro-Architecture\nFeature Levels\n\nWritten by Michael Larabel in Hardware on 7 April 2024 at 09:24 AM EDT. 18\nComments\n\nWhile recently there has been more Linux distribution vendor interest in\nevaluating x86-64-v2 and/or x86-64-v3 baselines for future Linux distribution\nreleases as well as offering optimized packages for higher x86-64 baselines\neither for x86-64-v3 with being able to assume AVX/AVX2 or in the x86-64-v4\nlevel where AVX-512 is introduced, the prospect of x86-64 micro-architecture\nfeature levels for future processors isn't clear.\n\nThe x86-64 micro-architecture levels were established in the first place by\nengineers from Red Hat, SUSE, Intel, and AMD that were picked up by the\nGCC/GNU toolchain and then LLVM for coming up with sane feature levels beyond\nthe x86_64 baseline specifications. These have worked out well with x86-64-v2\nencompassing useful additions and rather robustly supported by any non-\nobsolete x86_64 CPUs, x86-64-v3 adding AVX/AVX2 and other ISA features of the\npast decade, and then x86-64-v4 for AVX-512. But what about x86-64-v5 or any\nfuture iterations?\n\nThe possibility of x86-64-v5 was raised this week on the LLVM Discourse.\nLawrence Benson with TU Munich was raising the possibility of a x86-64-v5\ntarget that could encompass CPU ISA features of the very latest AMD and Intel\nCPUs. The hypothetical x86-64-v5 could fit well for AMD Zen 4 and Intel\nIcelake Server and newer. It also makes sense having a stepping stone prior to\nAVX10 rolling out.\n\nThat would make sense though no visible action on x86-64-v5 has happened yet.\nPhoebe Wang of Intel raised the matter that they have been having issue as\nwell internally with how to handle x86-64 micro-architecture feature levels\nwith respect to AVX10. With AVX10 making a maximum vector length of either 256\nor 512-bit, AVX 512-bit isn't necessarily guaranteed and thus hard to\nincorporate into an x86-64 feature level if a lot of CPU cores end up only\ngoing for 256-bit support... Or it could end up being a moot point if the\nfuture Intel/AMD CPUs tend to go the 512-bit route in practice. But otherwise\nnewer CPUs may be restricted to lower feature levels depending upon how the\nversions are structured.\n\n> \"Yes, how to perfectly arrange AVX10 256-bit to x86-64-vN is a headache\n> problem. We have some internal discussions and haven\u2019t made any consensus.\n> Suggestions are welcome!\"\n\nSo it will be interesting to see how future AVX10 iterations play out and if\nnew x86-64 feature level versions reach consensus.\n\n18 Comments\n\nRelated News\n\nFramework Hiring For Open-Source Firmware Development\n\nRust Bindings Are Being Worked On For Linux CPUFreq Drivers\n\nUPower Power Profiles Daemon v0.21 Automatically Adapts For Linux Laptop\nBattery Use\n\nPCIe 7.0 Specification v0.5 Published - Full Spec Next Year\n\nASUS WMI Driver For Linux Preps New Features For Recent ASUS Laptops\n\nTiny Corp Details More Of Their Planned Tinybox System Specs\n\nAbout The Author\n\nMichael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site\nin 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.
