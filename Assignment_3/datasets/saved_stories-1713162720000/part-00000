Thomas Kron | 10 April 2024\n\n## Key Messages\n\nFrom this month, adults in Germany can legally possess and consume certain\namounts of cannabis. While opinions on this development vary, it\u2019s widely\nacknowledged that cannabis can pose potential health risks. Hajar Zebbakh and\ncolleagues at the Ibn Sina University Hospital in Rabat, Morocco, have\nhighlighted a potential complication of recreational cannabis use based on the\ncase history of a young man.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\n## The Patient and His Story\n\nAccording to the authors, the 24-year-old man was admitted to the clinic in\nRabat experiencing status epilepticus. He reported a daily consumption of 8-10\ncannabis joints since the age of 18 years, with no use of alcohol or tobacco.\n\n## The Findings\n\n  * Glasgow Coma Scale: 8 out of 15\n  * Temperature: 36.8 \u00b0C\n  * Stable cardiovascular status; SpO2: 91%\n  * Leukocytosis: 25,000/mm\u2265\n  * Raised C-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels: 45 and 2.65 mg/L, respectively\n  * Normal kidney function, and lactate and serum carboxyhaemoglobin levels\n  * Electroencephalogram within normal limits\n  * Cerebral computed tomography revealed no lesions\n  * Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was normal\n  * Toxicological blood test positive for cannabis, but negative for alcohol or other drugs\n  * Cerebral MRI showed bilaterally symmetrical swelling of the hippocampi with high signal anomalies in T2-FLAIR and T2 sequences, hyperintense diffusion, and no enhancement after contrast injection\n\nDiagnosis: Acute hippocampal encephalopathy\n\n## Treatment and Course\n\nThe patient received treatment that included intravenous acyclovir (10 mg/kg\nevery 8 hours) despite negative PCR tests for herpes simplex viruses in the\ncerebrospinal fluid. Additionally, a corticosteroid bolus (500 mg/day),\nantibiotics, and immunoglobulins were administered due to suspected autoimmune\nencephalitis.\n\nAfter initial intensive care, the patient was transferred to a general\nneurological ward. According to Zebbakh and her colleagues, the patient showed\nclinical improvement and was discharged from the clinic after 10 days.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe authors explain that cannabis contains two psychoactive components,\n\u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol, both of which target type 1\ncannabinoid receptors found in the neural endings of several brain regions,\nincluding the hippocampus. This clarifies the involvement of the hippocampus\nin the case of the young patient. Additionally, these psychoactive components\ninteract with type 2 receptors in immune cells.\n\nExcessive cannabis use can lead to acute bilateral hippocampal lesions, as\nobserved on FLAIR and diffusion sequences of MRI. In the case of the 24-year-\nold patient, other potential causes of bilateral hippocampal lesions, such as\nherpes encephalitis and autoimmune encephalitis, were ruled out.\n\nA few years ago, French neurologists led by Laurent Cleret de Langavant from\nAssistance Publique-H\u00f4pitaux de Paris, CHU Henri Mondor, France, highlighted\nthe risk of acute hippocampal encephalopathy in heavy cannabis users in The\nAmerican Journal of Medicine.\n\nThey reported similar findings in two men with heavy cannabis use (>10\njoints/day), where MRI showed significant signal anomalies in the hippocampal\nregions. These patients also exhibited kidney dysfunction, rhabdomyolysis, and\nan inflammatory syndrome. However, no evidence of infectious or autoimmune\nencephalitis was found. Repeated electroencephalograms showed no epileptic\nactivity. The acute clinical and magnetic resonance imaging findings improved\nwithin a few weeks. Notably, a subsequent exposure to cannabis led to a new\nencephalopathic episode. A few months later, both patients experienced severe\nand long-lasting impairments of episodic memory, along with hippocampal\natrophy, as observed by the authors.\n\nCannabis is the most commonly used drug in Europe, according to Lars Wilhelm\nand Professor Jan Kramer and colleagues from LADR GmbH Medical Care Center in\nGeesthacht, Germany, as outlined in a journal article on the drug's\ntoxicology. Approximately 60% of the nearly 80 million consumers are male.\nLifetime prevalence of cannabis use in Europe varies widely, ranging from 4%\nin Malta to 45% in France. Cannabis-related offences dominate drug-related\ncrimes, with 57% of trafficking offences related to cannabis. The consumption\npatterns among today's youth suggest a continued increase in the recreational\nuse of cannabis as a narcotic drug.\n\nIn addition to the desired intoxicating effect of cannabis, undesirable\neffects also occur. These include impaired cognitive performance, particularly\naffecting memory, attention, and psychomotor skills. Regular use has been\nobserved to lead to a drop of eight IQ points. However, cognitive restrictions\nare usually no longer detectable after prolonged abstinence. Furthermore,\nstructural changes in brain regions with high CB1 receptor density, such as\nthe amygdala and hippocampus, have been demonstrated, as reported by the two\nauthors.\n\nThis story was translated from Univadis Germany using several editorial tools,\nincluding AI, as part of the process.
