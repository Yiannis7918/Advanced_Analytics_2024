I never wondered why\nnewspapers were printed on broadsheets that were too big for the bus. But\nFreek Vermeulen did. The clumsily sized standard for newspapers of record\npeeved him.\n\nIt took the associate professor of strategy and entrepreneurship at the London\nBusiness School years to ascertain that the widely used broadsheet dated back\nto 1712. That\u2019s when the English government began taxing newspaper owners by\nthe number of pages they printed. Bigger pages meant fewer pages and thus less\ntax. The tax was eventually abolished, but the broadsheet remained the\nstandard \u2014 even though the cost of the paper was high and its unwieldy\nhandling irritated readers such as Vermeulen.\n\nIn 2003, an English newspaper bucked the long-established standard. The\nstruggling Independent ran an experiment. It offered its paper in broadsheet\nand in a format exactly half that size in one market. The smaller paper\noutsold the larger by three to one. The Independent\u2019s leaders quickly adopted\nthe half-size version nationwide, and the paper\u2019s print circulation rose 20\npercent annually for several years.\n\nThe lesson, says Vermeulen, and the worthy theme of his new book, Breaking Bad\nHabits: \u201cKilling bad practices can open up new avenues of growth and\ninnovation and reinvigorate your business.\u201d\n\n\u201cKilling bad practices can open up new avenues of growth and innovation and\nreinvigorate your business.\u201d\n\n  * Share to:\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * LinkedIn\n\nVermeulen, who has written for strategy+business, devotes the first third of\nthe book to admiring the problem of bad practices. He points to the many\nfailed total quality management implementations in the 1980s and 1990s as an\nexample of how leaders try to replicate the successful practices of other\ncompanies, but muck it up through oversimplification. He blames the\norganizational tendency to assume there is a good reason for established\npractices for perpetuating the bad ones, \u00e0 la broadsheet newspapers. He calls\nout the perception biases and casual ambiguities that can blind leaders to the\nnegative, long-term consequences of the practices they adopt. As an example,\nVermeulen cites the continuing adherence of many companies to ISO 9000 quality\nassurance standards, even in the face of studies that show they have a\nstifling effect on breakthrough innovation and agility.\n\nIn the second third of the book, Vermeulen explores the silver lining in this\ncloud of bad corporate practices. Here, he offers two chapter-length cases of\nsuccessful businesses: Netherlands-based citizenM, a hotel chain founded in\n2008 that cut construction and staffing costs by 40 percent each and boasts\n95-plus percent occupancy rates, and U.K.-based consultancy Eden McCallum,\nwhich has built a client list of more than 300 corporations since 2000. But,\nas the author describes it, citizenM carved out a market space for itself by\ncreating a hotel that caters specifically to young, frequent business\ntravelers, and Eden McCallum cut its costs by hiring freelance consultants\ninstead of full-time employees. Precisely what \u201cbad\u201d practices the companies\neliminated are unclear.\n\nRelated Stories\n\n  * s+b Blogs\n\nBest Practices Are Dead\n\nby Tom Puthiyamadam\n\n  * Will Stronger Borders Weaken Innovation?\n\nby Barry Jaruzelski, Volker Staack, and Robert Chwalik\n\n  * Best Business Books\n\nBest Business Books 2017: Innovation\n\nby James Surowiecki\n\nAlthough the two cases may be a bit of a stretch, they do lead to the best\npart of Breaking Bad Habits: Vermeulen\u2019s \u201cTen Commandments\u201d for identifying\nand eliminating bad practices. These include replacing your company\u2019s\nbenchmarking efforts with \u201creverse benchmarking\u201d \u2014 that is, looking at\nestablished practices in your industry and asking what might happen if you\nstopped practicing them \u2014 which is what Herb Kelleher and Southwest Airlines\nfamously did when the airline eliminated the de rigueur airline meals. It\nturned out few travelers actually wanted them. Another of Vermeulen\u2019s\ncommandments is to pay close attention to the new companies and the distressed\ncompanies in your industry. They\u2019re likely to be questioning established\npractices and thus may lead you to an opportunity for innovation. It\u2019s not a\ncoincidence that The Times (of London) downsized its paper after the\nIndependent\u2019s experiment proved out.\n\nIn the final third of Breaking Bad Habits, Vermeulen roughly stitches together\nhis advice for stimulating organizational innovation, though the connection of\nthis advice to bad practices is tenuous at best. He reprises the 2010 Harvard\nBusiness Review article in which he and his coauthors made a strong case for\ncreating organizational change whether there\u2019s an explicit need for it or not,\nbecause corporate success is a quest without end. He argues in favor of doing\nhard things, because challenging tasks yield valuable organizational learning.\nAnd he advises leaders to cast their innovation nets as widely as they can to\ncollect ideas, but to be highly selective in choosing which ideas to pursue\nand fund.\n\nIn all, Breaking Bad Habits isn\u2019t the most coherently argued book. But it does\ncontain nuggets of insight and advice that are well worth mining.\n\n## Author profile:\n\n  * Theodore Kinni is a contributing editor of strategy+business.
