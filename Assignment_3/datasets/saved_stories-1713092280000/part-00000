Then I\ndiscovered the Django framework.\n\nILLUSTRATION: SAMUEL TOMSON\n\nThe German historian Oswald Spengler considered our age the age of\nabstraction. Nowhere is this more apparent than in programming, where\nabstraction isn\u2019t just a conceptual convenience but an absolute necessity.\nProgrammers like to talk about their tools (rather abstractly) as a \u201cstack.\u201d\nAt the top of the stack\u2014the surface most of us encounter first\u2014are simple\nmarkup languages, HTML being the best known. At the bottom are the \u201cbare\nmetal\u201d languages of the machine. Thus there is a hierarchy, and the further\ndown in the stack you go, the less abstract\u2014and, in a way, more\ndifficult\u2014programming gets.\n\nMachine Readable\n\nA regular column about programming. Because if/when the machines take over, we\nshould at least speak their language.\n\nIt\u2019s not really metal down there, of course. It\u2019s sand\u2014impossibly thin layers\nof silicon dioxide that conduct electrical impulses in ordered patterns we\nexperience as a screen showing us a rectangle with text on it, flickering\nimages, and so on. Still, you can see how Spengler, though he died before the\nera of digital computing, was on to something. None of us are keeping 1s and\n0s etched in sand in our head, and yet we all manipulate them every day using\nfriendly, high-level abstractions.\n\nThe danger of living in this Spenglerian moment is that it\u2019s easy to mistake\nsuch abstractions for the world as it really is. This, I think, is why\nprogrammers often dive deeper into the stack as they progress through their\ncareers. We think that maybe when we reach bare metal our world will finally\nbe real.\n\nFeatured Video\n\nI started, like most, at the top of the stack. HTML. 1995. Geocities.\nAngelfire. Blink tags. Marquee. I\u2019ll admit it: I loved me some marquee tag,\nwhich scrolled text across the screen. I loved marquee so much I ran straight\nout of HTML and into the welcoming arms of Flash. Blame the Matrix website.\nCoolest animation ever.\n\nFlash was not really programming. Or, it didn\u2019t start that way. It was an\nanimation app. You drew shapes on a stage, dragged them around, and set\nkeyframes like animated film. A UI abstraction descended from Looney Toons.\nBut then someone shoehorned a scripting language in there, and next thing you\nknow I was writing quadratic easing equations to control the shapes. (Turns\nout my high school trig teacher was right\u2014I really was going to use this stuff\none day.)\n\nI was drawn to the elegance and simplicity of writing code in a text file\nrather than clicking and dragging things around. This felt like the way it\nshould be: Write code; things happen. But with Flash there was a very limited\namount of things that could happen. I wanted to go lower in the stack. I\nwanted fewer abstractions.\n\nBack then, my escape from the world of programming was a day job running a\nrestaurant kitchen. There\u2019s nothing abstract about the Friday night rush.\nOddly enough, that was where I was when I figured out how to get closer to the\nmachine.\n\nIt was 2004 when my best dishwasher, Aaron, a young man who enjoyed solving\nunsolved math theorems in his spare time (yes, it was a lot like working with\nGood Will Hunting), told me, \u201cIf you want to go deeper in the stack, learn\nPython.\u201d He was smarter than me, so I wrote it down. Learn Python.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Security\n\nHow Israel Is Defending Against Iran's Drone Attack\n\nBrian Barrett\n\n  * Gear\n\nKeurig\u2019s New Coffee Pods Are Completely Compostable\u2014but You\u2019ll Need a New\nMachine to Use Them\n\nJaina Grey\n\n  * Gear\n\n24 Mother\u2019s Day Gift Ideas for the Superhero in Your Life\n\nAdrienne So\n\n  * Security\n\nSpace Force Is Planning a Military Exercise in Orbit\n\nStephen Clark, Ars Technica\n\nThe difficulty with any new programming language is the sharp learning curve,\nall that drudgery and bashing your forehead into the keyboard. There was no\nCodecademy or Stack Overflow in those days. We bought books from the likes of\nO\u2019Reilly and No Starch Press. I bought Learning Python and skimmed the first\nfew chapters, but I had no project to motivate me. Without something that\nobsesses you, you\u2019ll never learn to program.\n\nI also didn\u2019t have much time. Running a restaurant kitchen is an all-\nconsuming, life-sucking thing to do. After another year I burned out. I\nscraped together what money I had, bought a plane ticket, and headed off to\nlose myself in Asia. Hey, it worked for the Beatles. Sort of.\n\nOne day, I decided I needed some more music by the great jazz guitarist Django\nReinhardt. I went down to the internet caf\u00e9 below my guest house in Bangkok to\nsearch for it. The problem was that the keyboard, naturally enough, was Thai.\nI could change the layout in Windows settings, but the symbols on the keys\nwere still Thai. I figured \u201cDjango\u201d was a distinctive enough name that that\nwas all I needed. (This was before the Tarantino movie existed.) I typed it in\nand, sure enough, Reinhardt was right there in the first couple of results.\n\nBut what caught my eye was a website for something called Django, \u201cthe web\nframework for perfectionists with deadlines.\u201d I didn\u2019t have any deadlines, but\nperfectionist? I can\u2019t tell you how many times I messed with tabs and spaces\nto make sure my handwritten HTML was properly indented when you viewed the\nsource. Was there, possibly, a web framework for people like me? Tell me more.\n\nDjango, it turned out, was a Python framework. If this were a movie, there\nwould have been a badly animated sequence here where Aaron\u2019s face cut through\na cloud of Southeast Asian traveler haze, saying, Learn Python. Learn Python.\nSix months later, back in Los Angeles, a friend asked me to build a website\nfor a bike charity, Wheels4Life. I agreed to do it, on the condition that I\nuse Django. I had a project.\n\nThat website turned out well. It led to another. And another. Eventually I had\na small business building Django-based websites. It took a couple of years,\nbut I wrapped my head around Python and got to the point where, given a\nproblem, I could work out a way to solve it.\n\nBut here\u2019s what surprised me: I never went any deeper. Never wanted to. Python\nfalls about midway down the stack, but it\u2019s unique in its ability to move in\neither direction. You can work at the highest levels of abstraction and spit\nout HTML websites (Django\u2019s specialty), but you can also get closer to the\nmachine through an API that lets you import C modules. Working in Python, I\ncould build anything I ever wanted to build. At a certain point, I realized I\nwasn\u2019t even thinking about the stack anymore. I was just thinking about the\npossibilities.\n\nI went to the first Django conference, ostensibly covering it for WIRED, but I\nwas also there to meet the founders and learn from the community. What I found\nwas a welcoming group of fellow nerds and programmers all working together to\nsolve problems and build cool stuff. It was all very concrete. Tangible. Even\nas it arose from abstractions.\n\nTo say that we live in an age of abstraction can be pejorative. The word\nimplies an excessive distance from the bedrock truth of things, and we tend to\nview that\u2014often rightly\u2014with suspicion. But it seems to me, now, that the\nquest to de-abstract everything, to get to the bottom of the stack, is an urge\nborn of bygone times. The bare metal can be wherever you find yourself, your\nlanguage of choice, your community. That\u2019s where you build your world.\n\n## You Might Also Like ...\n\n  * In your inbox: The best and weirdest stories from WIRED\u2019s archive\n\n  * Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s island visitors exposed by data broker\n\n  * 8 Google employees invented modern AI.
