[iStock]\n\nA good friend\u2014a well-known, longtime aviator and author of books and aviation\ncolumns (alas, for another magazine)\u2014told me he had attempted to write\nsomething about the glorious obsession many of us have with airplanes and\nflying...often from childhood. But despite chewing on it for a long time, he\nfinally gave up\u2014saying it just wouldn\u2019t \u201ccome together.\u201d\n\nFearless when it comes to busting into places where other\u2014often more\ncompetent\u2014flyers and writers are reluctant to go, I decided to give it a try.\nAfter all, who has more firsthand knowledge of what happens when this very\nreal, deep-rooted part of us is sabotaged by events such as a denied medical\nor insurance, a financial problem, or even something as weird as flying under\na bridge? (And, no, I didn\u2019t turn my transponder off!)\n\n#### This Article First Appeared in FLYING Magazine\n\nIf you\u2019re not already a subscriber, what are you waiting for?

Then, beginning with ex-World War I flyers who\nbecame the daredevil barnstormers and mail pilots of the 1920s and \u201930s and\nfeats of Lindbergh, Earhart, Post, and other household names, publicity and\ninterest grew. In the years following World War II, a bunch of \u201clittle\u201d\nairplanes appeared that were simple enough that almost anybody could learn to\nfly. And aviation was more accessible, affordable, and hugely popular.\n\nSporty\u2019s Pilot Shop founder Hal Shevers told me one time, \u201cMarf, we lived\nthrough the \u2018Golden Era of General Aviation.\u2019\u201d And he was right. The 1950s,\n\u201960s, and \u201970s were the glory days before airplane prices exploded\u2014as did\ntomes of onerous regulations and complex airspace restrictions\u2014and insurance\nrequirements, maintenance costs, and manufacturer liability issues mushroomed.\nSadly, it was those liability issues and an unacceptable accident rate that\nbegan to choke private and small business aviation in the \u201980s and \u201990s.\n\nBut the die-hards stayed with it, forming flying clubs and partnerships,\nbuying and renovating old airplanes, or building experimental models\nthemselves. It was costly, but their obsession made them find a way.\n\n  * READ MORE: Let Me Tell You About Tom\n\nNow there\u2019s a desperate need for pilots. With that comes the danger of\n\u201centicing\u201d applicants who lack the deep-seated desire and passion but are\nbeguiled by the salaries and prestige that go with being an airline pilot.\nFlight training schools and universities are eager to enroll students who\nqualify for generous scholarships\u2014 some from the airlines themselves. Others\nare attracted by the ease of borrowing huge sums to complete \u201cfast-track\u201d\ntraining with the promise of an interview and likely a job in the right seat\nof an airliner. What isn\u2019t advertised is that flight training dropout\nstatistics average 80 percent.\n\nA genuine interest in and aptitude for flying airplanes is a huge blessing for\nthose becoming professional pilots. Despite the growing need for more pilots,\nit is vital that airline companies don\u2019t lower hiring standards\u2014as has been\naccused\u2014and put marginally qualified new hires in their cockpits by maybe\nthinking experience will \u201cfix\u201d the problem.\n\nFlight schools advertise that you\u2019re guaranteed an airline interview by\nsuccessfully completing their \u201cfast-track\u201d programs. They\u2019ll guide you through\nthe process of logging 1,500 hours of flight and simulator time. Simply sign\nup, pay something close to $100,000, pass an FAA medical, get a student\ncertificate, and take the dual for solo and solo cross-country signoffs.\nYou\u2019ll learn enough in ground schools to pass the FAA knowledge exams and log\nenough time and have the skill to pass a private pilot check ride. Ditto for\nthe instrument, commercial, multiengine, and CFI certificates and ratings. And\nthey assure you this can be accomplished in \u201conly seven months.\u201d Then you\ninstruct for the school, earning between $15 and $50 per hour until you\naccumulate the necessary 1,500 (or, in some cases, 1,200) hours to apply for\nthe right seat with an air carrier. All this is possible in two to three years\nwith no guarantee of actually being hired...and not living in your parents\u2019\nbasement.\n\nOne major carrier has pledged that 50 percent of its new hires will be \u201cpeople\nof color and females.\u201d Its program offers scholarships from the Latino Pilots\nAssociation, National Gay Pilots Association, Organization of Black Aerospace\nProfessionals, Professional Asian Pilots Association, Sisters of the Skies,\nand Women in Aviation International. It is hoped that making the training\navailable inspires young people\u2014regardless of sex, color, ethnicity, people\nwho may never have had the opportunity to learn about aviation\u2014to embrace the\ntraining. That\u2019s laudable, so long as it doesn\u2019t exclude anyone.\n\nA retired airline pilot friend commented: \u201cAnyone who remembers the Colgan\n[Air] crash at KBUF [Buffalo, New York, in 2009] should understand the\nsignificance of airlines hiring qualified pilots. That accident was a \u2018perfect\nstorm\u2019 of pilot incompetence, management failure, weather, and other factors\ncausing the deaths of a planeload of people. Aviation is inherently dangerous,\nand when incompetent pilots are given the controls of an aircraft filled with\npeople, the situation becomes an accident waiting to happen.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a poignant quote from an article in FLYING Magazine in July 1953: \u201cTen-\nthousand articles have been written about the ebb of aviation enthusiasm and\nactivity in the land. Apathy to aviation is just one of many indications that\n20 years\u2019 education that \u2018the world owes me a living\u2019 has wrought havoc with\nour individual spirits. We babble about Social Security and prate in terms of\nmasses and promise \u2018extended benefits.\u2019 ...It means we\u2019ve had a flameout of\nthe fire that molded us and gave us power. We\u2019ve stopped running to meet life\nbecause that takes faith and courage and pride.\u201d\n\nIt was written by no less a personage than Gill Robb Wilson, one of the\nmagazine\u2019s founders and editors, and a World War I combat pilot in France,\ndevoted patriot, founder of the Civil Air Patrol, writer, and poet (and,\ncuriously, a Presbyterian minister). I think his comments apply to young men\nand women today who look upon aviation training and airline flying as a quick\nroad to success, prestige, and security.\n\nI recently took Theo, a neighborhood kid, up in the Cessna 180 because he\u2019s\ncrazy about aviation and airplanes. Theo is intelligent and amazingly\nknowledgeable because he reads everything in sight about airplanes and pilots.\nHe\u2019s just beginning high school but, when I asked him if he\u2019d thought about\ncollege, he named a large \u201cdegree plus aviation training mill\u201d in Florida. I\nsuggested maybe he think about a degree in engineering, business, or whatever\nat a good college while learning to fly \u201cthe old-fashioned way\u201d and then\ninstructing to learn and build time. He\u2019s wired for an airline career, and\nhe\u2019ll make it\u2014with the passion for it well in place.\n\nThis column first appeared in the November 2023/Issue 943 of FLYING\u2019s print\nedition.\n\nMartha Lunken\n\nMartha Lunken is a lifelong pilot, former FAA inspector and defrocked pilot\nexaminer.
