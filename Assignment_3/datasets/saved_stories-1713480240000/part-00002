Typically, the imposter journal\nsets up a fraudulent website for the purpose of offering scholars the\nopportunity to rapidly publish their research online for a fee\u201d (para. 1,\n2023).\n\nWe hope this post will provide clarity for the journal\u2019s subscribers, readers\nand authors, and will be useful for other publishers.\n\nWe also, as a mission driven University Press, want to be as transparent as\npossible.\n\nFraudulent journal site\n\nThe first indication something was amiss came in the form of an email from an\nauthor on 17^th December 2023, asking why the journal Scopus listing was\nincorrect \u2013 pointing out (correctly) that it was our responsibility as\npublishers to keep the details up to date. After requesting the listing be\namended, we assumed this was a simple error.\n\nEstablished by Liverpool University Press in 1979, International Development\nPlanning Review (IDPR) is published Open Access under our LUP Open Planning\n\u2018Subscribe to Open\u2019 agreement, meaning that there are no APCs (Article\nPublishing Charge) for authors. When an author contacted us to enquire how\nmuch the journal APC was on 20^th December, and supplied the following website\nas part of our conversation with them \u2013\nhttps://idpr.org.uk/index.php/idpr/index \u2013 we became concerned.\n\nThis was a clone of the journal\u2019s own homepage \u2013 containing the journal\nbranding, requesting (and accepting) submissions, and displaying content. The\ncontent seemed to be nonsense, and had not been taken from our site, but the\nsite was very convincing. Our concern was not that genuine IDPR content was\nbeing scraped, but that someone posing as the editor of the journal was\naccepting papers and liaising with authors.\n\nStep 1\n\nOur first step was to email the \u2018Editor\u2019 with a take-down notice. We informed\nthem that \u201ca CC-BY-ND license permits reuse and sharing of the open access\ncontent it does not permit the hosting of the material on any sites\nfraudulently purporting to be the journal. This is a deceptive practice that\nis damaging to both the journal\u2019s and the publisher\u2019s reputation\u201d\u2013 even more\nconfusingly, the email bounced.\n\nStep 2\n\nWe contacted the Public Knowledge Project and asked for advice \u2013 they were\nvery helpful:\n\nI sympathize with your current predicament \u2013 it is an increasingly common\nsituation we are seeing globally. The journal in question does appear to use\nOpen Journal Systems (OJS), which is developed by the Public Knowledge Project\n(PKP). However, OJS is open source and freely downloadable and usable by\nanyone, without direct involvement by our team. As such, we cannot act\ndirectly to manage or otherwise intervene where it is being used as a tool by\nothers. I can confirm that our own journal hosting service, PKP Publishing\nServices, is in no way involved in managing that particular domain, and we do\nnot provide hosting or other services to this group.\n\nThey recommended that we report the journal to the Retraction Watch Hijacked\nJournal Checker, which lists hijacked journals \u2013 the journal is now listed\nthere but we are unsure how many authors are aware.\n\nThey also recommended that we \u201creport the fraudulent site on this page to\nrequest to have it excluded from Google\u2019s main and Scholar search results.\u201d\n\nSites such as the above come and go with some speed, so I\u2019d encourage you to\nthink of this not so much as an issue with this site specifically, but as an\nongoing general concern that will require some information literacy from your\nreadership (as well as across the scholarly landscape more generally). We\nrecommend supporting efforts such as Think. Check. Submit.\n(http://thinkchecksubmit.org/) in this regard.\n\nGoogle have not been particularly helpful, responding to my queries with a\nrequest of \u2018proof of ownership of copyright\u2019 stating that \u2018copyright in a\ncreative work is generally owned by the person who created it\u2019. They have\nignored our assertions that Liverpool University Press owns the journal and\nall associated copyrights (branding, cover design, ISSN etc) stating that they\ncannot delist the fake journal site, as we are not the \u2018creators\u2019.\n\nIn the meantime, our journal editors started receiving a number of spam\nsubmissions and emails, plus a couple offering to buy the journal (!). Our\neditors started blocking/deleting/ignoring. Author queries were responded to\nquickly, and most quoted the fake site.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nBy mid January 2024, the Editors of IDPR were receiving 3-6 submissions a day\non \u2018dog breeding\u2019, lung cancer, cricket games, cat influenza in Baghdad etc.\nThey continue to delete and block.\n\nOur authors continue to contact us as publishers and the editors to ask\nwhere/whether an APC should be paid, and we continue to advise. They are also\nbeing sent fake acceptance letters and contacting us to check.\n\nIn March 2024 the journal\u2019s Scholar One site was affected. The \u201cJournal Home\u201d\nlink mysteriously changed to the fraudulent site \u2013 Scholar One were unable to\ntell us who made/requested the change, or how they did it? This was a worrying\ndevelopment.\n\nWe are not alone in the issues we have been facing. We note that the problem\nhas become so serious, that SCOPUS has removed links to the homepages of all\nthe journals it indexes \u2013 https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/28/elseviers-\nscopus-deletes-journal-links-following-revelations-of-hijacked-indexed-\njournals/ from Retraction Watch.\n\nThis blog piece has been put together to share with all our authors and\nreaders to make them aware, and to alert other publishers of our size to this\npredatory practice.\n\n\u2014\n\nInternational Development Planning Review is a peer-reviewed journal which\nprovides an interdisciplinary platform for the critical study of development\nrelated practices, planning and policy in the global South.\n\nThe journal publishes theoretically informed and empirically grounded papers,\ncritical reviews, and viewpoints.\n\nThe latest issue has just been published \u2013\nhttps://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/toc/idpr/current and the editors\ncontinue to welcome submissions in the field.\n\nThe journal\u2019s impact factor was 1.6 in 2022 and the CiteScore was 3.6.\n\n\u2014\n\nEditors\u2019 statements\n\n\u201cWe hope that this blog is shared widely to alert researchers, readers, and\neditors of other journals, to the growing problem of copycat journal websites.\n\nAs editors, we are very concerned about the direct effects of this attack on\nanyone who may have submitted to the fake site.\n\nWe are also concerned about the wider impact on the journal: IDPR is run by a\nsmall team, for whom a hacking attack like this represents a significant\nburden of extra work, as well as the loss of a range of genuine submissions\nand the continued existence of a fraudulent site using our branding.\n\nIDPR has always offered close support to our contributors, particularly to\nearly career researchers and those writing from the Global South, and perhaps\nour best response to this attack is to reiterate this as a central part of how\nthe journal operates.\n\nWe\u2019d therefore like to assure potential authors that they can get in touch\nwith the editorial team directly at any stage of the publication process \u2013\nfrom pitching ideas to discussing reviewers\u2019 comments \u2013 and receive a\npersonal, professional and constructive response. IDPR values this dialogue as\nit contributes to the quality of our output, and more generally to upholding\nthe relationships of trust on which academic publishing so heavily depends.\n\nWe would also strongly encourage all authors \u2013 whether for IDPR or any other\nlegitimate academic journal \u2013 to double-check the authenticity of webpages and\nsubmission links before submitting their work to avoid falling victim to this\ntype of scam.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/journal/idpr\n\nClare Hooper, Director of Journals Publishing, LUP.\n\nFollow us for more updates Sign up to our mailing list Twitter | Instagram www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * Email\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### Related\n\nImportant Notice: Distribution of Australian Journal of French Studies &\nBritish Journal of Canadian StudiesSeptember 4, 2023In \"Journals\"\n\nLiverpool University Press to publish the Journal of Jewish Studies from\n2024March 13, 2024In \"Jewish Studies\"\n\nThe Journal of Romanian Studies moves to a new distribution modelDecember 19,\n2023In \"Journals\"\n\nClone journals, Copied journal sites, copycat journal websites, fraudulent\njournal sites, Hijacked journals, idpr, international development planning\nreview, Journals, planning, urban planning\n\n# Sign up to our mailing list\n\n# Recent Posts\n\n  * Featured in Town Planning Review 95.2: Ideology, statecraft and the \u2018double shuffle\u2019 of Conservative planning reform in England\n  * Journals and publishers facing issues from fraudulent sites\n  * Lord Byron after 200 years\n  * In Conversation with...
