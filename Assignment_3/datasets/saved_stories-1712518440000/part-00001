I might cringe\nbecause I see some past writing was naive, mistaken, locked-in, overconfident,\nunkind, insensitive, aggressive, or grandiose.\n\nI now have a pretty big dataset to identify my secret trick to write more\ncringe: less sleep.\n\nFor this post I combined 2,500 nights of sleep data with 58 blog posts. A 7\nyear experiment to see how sleep affects my writing.\n\nInteractive version.\n\n# ~7 Hours is the Cutoff\n\nMost posts above 7 hours of sleep do not need a sleep disclaimer. Most posts\nbelow 7 hours do. Not to say there is no value in the posts made with under 7\nhours of sleep, it's just less rigorous writing (and thinking). On the plus\nside, writing with little sleep can be more concise at times. It might\nexaggerate the key ideas, but nevertheless identify them fearlessly and\nconcisely.\n\n# Interactive Table\n\nStatic image of table above.\n\n# More Posts. Similar Word Counts. Higher Scatteredness. Similar IQ. Higher\nConfidence.\n\nI actually post slightly more when I sleep less (Pearson correlation\ncoefficient of -.14), but fewer words per post, which is indicative of a more\n\"scattered\" thinking state. I was surprised to see that I don't generally\ngenerate a whole lot more words in deprived sleep states. I perceive my\nwriting to be smarter during those times, but looking back it's clearly not.\n\n# Other Social Media\n\nBesides this blog, I have long written and posted content to HackerNews,\nReddit, other discussion forums, and at times Twitter, Instagram, Facebook,\nYouTube, and LinkedIn. I haven't done the data grunt work, but if my memory\nserves me correctly I am confident my publishing behavior on those platforms\nmirrors the same patterns as my blogging behavior, with regards to sleep.\n\n# Public vs Private Writing\n\nThere have been stretches where I published little publicly but was generating\na similar amount of tokens, just in private groups. My writing patterns in\nprivate groups also mirrors my patterns on this blog, with regards to sleep.\n\nTangent: when I've been lucky to be a part of brainiac private organizations\n(such as Microsoft, YCombinator, Our World in Data, academia, and so on), I\ngot to read so much brilliant writing by people who rarely post publicly, and\nevery time I think about that I am humbled. There is so much well written\ncontent on the public web, and to think it is only a fraction of the great\ncontent ever written, is humbling.\n\n# Sleep Disclaimers\n\nI realize I already have an unofficial \"sleep disclaimer\" policy. I have de-\nindexed (but kept published) at least a couple of sleep-deprived posts, and\nadded a disclaimer/correction to at least 2 others. Now with this dataset I am\nsure I will append a few more sleep disclaimers.\n\nWith sleep disclaimers, I can say, \"hey, might be interesting ideas here, but\ndon't train too heavily on this\".\n\n# Grateful for Git\n\nI am happy with my decision to use git for this blog so that I always keep an\nhonest history, while still being free to down weight sleep deprived content\nand try and keep my more thought-out out ideas front and center.\n\n# Benefits of Peer Review\n\nI don't have a column for it (yet), but it does seem my better posts often\nwere the ones where I took the time to get friends and/or colleagues to\nreview, IRL. Sleep deprived posts I would generally blast out without talking\nto anyone.\n\nPeer review is a great filter, and a great forcing function to put more effort\nin.\n\nOn the other hand, because the importance of ideas varies by so many orders of\nmagnitude (there are \"black swan\" ideas), you could make an argument that\nspending too much time in one area of ideas isn't the optimal strategy, and\npublishing things as you go, improving them later, is an approach with merit.\n\n# Writing data reflects the current phenomena in your brain\n\nIt seems when I sleep less, my brain is in more of a pleasure seeking state,\nhas a bias to action (\"don't think, just do\"), and feels less pain than in a\nmore rested state. Less sleep means less critical thinking. Less sleep seems\nto make me less willing to invest the time in rewiring my brain to correct\nmistaken thought habits.\n\n# Grateful for FitBit\n\nI started wearing a Microsoft Band when it first came out in November 2014.\nThen a Band 2, then FitBit Charge, Ionic, Versa, and now Sense 2. I am\ngrateful for all the people involved with creating these things. I think\ncontinued progress in the wearable sensor field is the best bet for improving\nhuman health.\n\nim-back.html \u00b7 sleepWriting.html \u00b7 doHumanBrainsMolt.html\n\nView source\n\nBuilt with Scroll v75.0.0\n\n", "frontpage": true}
