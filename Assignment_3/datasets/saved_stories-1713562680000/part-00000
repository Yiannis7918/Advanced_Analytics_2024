No buttons, no clicking - just forward an email, and a calendar\nevent gets added to your Google Calendar.\n\nfwd2cal uses an LLM to parse the thread, generate a JSON of the event details,\nand then adds the event to your google calendar.\n\nfwd2cal.com - running in production, free until it gets annoying/expensive to\nrun.\n\nYou can self host - it runs on firebase functions.\n\n## Features:\n\n  * Signup with an email: just email calendar@fwd2cal.com and you'll be sent a google auth link.\n  * Send from multiple email addresses: send add myworkemail@address.com to calendar@fwd2cal.com, and then you can add events to your google calendar from another email address\n  * Completely private: No logging, or storage of any emails. All that is stored are your email addresses.\n  * That's it. The goal is to just do one thing correctly and stay out of the way of the user.\n\n## Self hosting setup\n\nYou will need:\n\n  1. a firebase project\n  2. an openAI API key with gpt4 access\n  3. a sendgrid account setup with a domain to receive emails\n\n    \n    \n    firebase functions:config:set environment.name=\"production\" firebase functions:config:set environment.openai_api_key=\"sk-YOUR_API_KEY\" firebase functions:config:set environment.sendgrid_api_key=\"YOUR_API_KEY\" firebase functions:config:set environment.sendgrid_endpoint=\"very_hard_to_guess_endpoint\"\n\nMake sure you then set the secret URL as your parse URL in sendgrid.\n\n## Local setup\n\nFor local, edit .runtimeconfig.json\n\n    \n    \n    { \"environment\": { \"name\": \"local\", \"openai_api_key\": \"sk-YOUR_API_KEY\", \"sendgrid_api_key\": \"your-sendgrid-api-key\", } }\n\nAlso - you're probably going to want to save your credentials from\nhttps://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials to: functions/auth/google-\nauth-credentials.json.\n\nYou want to make sure your redirect_uris are setup correctly. It is a list,\n[0] should be the default from firebase, [1] should be\nhttp://localhost:5001/yourappname/your-region/oauthCallback, and [2] should be\nthe prod url.\n\n## Testing\n\n    \n    \n    export TESTER_PRIMARY_GOOGLE_ACCT=\"your@gmail.com\" export TESTER_SECONDARY_EMAIL_ACCT=\"anotherEmailAddressThatYouUse@anything.com\" cd functions npm test\n\nMake sure you authorize your google account in 30 seconds after starting the\ntest so the tests can run.\n\nTo test pubsub cron jobs:\n\n    \n    \n    firebase functions:shell refreshTokensScheduled()\n\nIf you know how to make a test script properly send a pubsub message on the\nfirebase emulator, a PR would be appreciated.\n\n## Contributing\n\nAll contributions are welcome. I will do by best to keep main stable.\n\n### Where you can help:\n\n  * functions/util/prompts.js - Prompt engineers can help here, if you notice fwd2cal fail to add your event correctly, think of adding an example to the prompt that teaches gpt4\n  * Timezones - I find the current prompt is bad at understanding timezones; likely worth adding another prompt only to detect the timezone.\n  * Multiple calendars: right now all events are added to the default calendar - but GPT4 can likely understand the context of all the users calendar and select an appropriate one.\n  * Get rid of all the hard coded references to fwd2cal.com so it can be self hosted easier.\n  * Find a way to add a test for the oAuth refresh tokens. I didn't bother\n  * Upgrade to firebase functions v2\n\n## Author\n\nThis was written by @moeadham to get familiar with firebase and webstudio -\ntraining for a much larger project I'm working on.\n\n## About\n\nForward an email and use AI to turn it into a calendar event.\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\n### License\n\nApache-2.0 license\n\nActivity\n\n### Stars\n\n1 star\n\n### Watchers\n\n2 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n0 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases\n\nNo releases published\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Languages\n\n  * JavaScript 95.2%\n  * HTML 4.6%\n  * Shell 0.2%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
