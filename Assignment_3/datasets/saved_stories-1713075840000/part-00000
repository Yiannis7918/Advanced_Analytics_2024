She\nis also the host of Hell or High Water: When Disaster Hits Home, a podcast\nfrom Vox Media and Audible Originals.\n\nApr 10, 2024, 9:00 AM UTC\n\n## Share this story\n\nPart of a filtration system designed to filter out PFAS forever chemicals from\nthe drinking water supply at Well #2 of the Horsham Water and Sewer Authority\nfacility in Horsham, Pennsylvania, on August 22nd, 2019.\n\nPhoto by Bastiaan Slabbers / NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has finalized rules for the amount\nof certain \u201cforever chemicals\u201d allowed in drinking water. This is the first\ntime the US has placed legally enforceable federal limits on per- and\npolyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), chemicals so ubiquitous that they\u2019ve likely\nalready made their way into most Americans\u2019 bloodstreams.\n\nThere are thousands of different kinds of PFAS used to make products resistant\nto water, stains, and heat. Before potential health risks came to light, these\nchemicals became staple ingredients in everything from nonstick pans, food\npackaging, fire-fighting foams, and fabric protector to dental floss and\nmenstrual products. The chemicals\u2019 hallmark hardiness also means that they\naccumulate and persist in the environment for a long time, making their way\ninto water supplies.\n\nEnvironmental and health advocates have pushed the EPA to place limits on PFAS\nin drinking water for years\n\nThe drinking water standards finalized today set limits for just five widely\nused types of forever chemicals: PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, PFHxS, and HFPO-DA (also\nknown as \u201cGenX Chemicals\u201d), plus mixtures of several chemicals, including\nperfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS) found in floor wax, carpeting, and carpet\ncleaners.\n\nScientists are still trying to understand how exposure to PFAS affects people.\nBut initial studies have linked high exposure to heightened risk of certain\nkinds of cancer, liver damage, high cholesterol, and reproductive health\nissues including lower infant birth weight.\n\nFor years, environmental and health advocates have pushed the EPA to place\nlimits on PFAS in drinking water. Manufacturers, including 3M, have faced\nthousands of lawsuits from consumers and states over the use of PFAS in their\nproducts. They\u2019ve since phased out the use of certain kinds of forever\nchemicals, but replacements, including GenX chemicals and PFBS, have raised\nsimilar concerns as their predecessors.\n\nUnder the EPA\u2019s new rules, public water systems will be required to test\ndrinking water and make sure levels of the five kinds of regulated PFAS stay\nbelow mandated thresholds. The limit is 4 parts per trillion for PFOA and\nPFOS, the two most common types of forever chemicals, and 10 parts for\ntrillion for the other three types of PFAS. Noting \u201cthe latest science showing\nthat there is no level of exposure to these contaminants without risk of\nhealth impacts, including certain cancers\u201d in a press release, the EPA is also\nsetting a \u201cnon-enforceable health-based goal\u201d of zero for PFOA and PFOS.\n\n\u201cA growing body of scientific research shows that PFAS chemicals are more\nharmful to human health than previously thought, and at extremely low levels,\u201d\nAnna Reade, director of PFAS advocacy at the Natural Resources Defense Council\n(NRDC), said in an emailed statement.\n\nMore than 100 million people in the US drink water from systems with PFAS\nlevels higher than the new regulations, according to the NRDC. The EPA\nestimates that up to 10 percent of the nation\u2019s 66,000 public drinking water\nsystems may have to treat water or find new water supplies in order to fall in\nline with the new standards. Public water systems will have three years to\nsample their water and notify the public about PFAS levels and five years to\nimplement plans to lower the amount of forever chemicals if they run afoul of\nthe new regulations.\n\n### Related\n\n  * Forever chemicals are disproportionately polluting Black and Hispanic neighborhoods\n  * A new way to smash the \u2018forever\u2019 out of \u2018forever chemicals\u2019\n\nA Harvard study published last year found that communities with larger\nproportions of Black and Latino residents are disproportionately exposed to\nharmful levels of PFAS in drinking water.\n\nIn a call with reporters ahead of today\u2019s announcement, EPA Administrator\nMichael Regan said, \u201cI have to say it\u2019s a good day for the people in this\ncountry who have long borne the impact of pollution from these forever\nchemicals.\u201d\n\nUpdate April 10th, 2024 8:40AM ET: This post has been updated with more\ndetails on limits to each individual type of PFAS, and a reaction from the\nNRDC.\n\nMost Popular\n\nMost Popular\n\n  1. ## Spotify\u2019s lossless audio could finally arrive as part of \u2018Music Pro\u2019 add-on\n\n  2. ## Oh no, I started playing Fallout Shelter again\n\n  3. ## Galaxy AI features are coming to last-gen Samsung phones \u2014 including the S21 series\n\n  4. ## Tesla slashes price for monthly Full Self-Driving subscription\n\n  5. ## The Google One VPN service is heading to the Google graveyard\n\nFrom our sponsor\n\nAdvertiser Content From\n\n## More from Science\n\n  * ### In a first, international court upholds right to be safe from climate change\n\n  * ### Can you watch a solar eclipse in the Apple Vision Pro?\n\n  * ### The total eclipse shows us how important solar energy is to the US\n\n  * ### Everything you need to know about the upcoming solar eclipse\n\n  * Advertiser Content From\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Notice\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Info\n  * Licensing FAQ\n  * Accessibility\n  * Platform Status\n  * How We Rate and Review Products\n\n  * Contact\n  * Tip Us\n  * Community Guidelines\n  * About\n  * Ethics Statement\n\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Jobs @ Vox Media\n\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
