I would spend decades playing this \"human\"\ngame of going to school and work, for what? I'd have to keep waking up and\nplay pretend in this made-up system, over and over, every day for the rest of\nmy life.\n\nThe existential depression never went away. And the more I got depressed and\ntalked to myself endlessly, the more bleak everything seemed.\n\nI got bullied in high school, and was forced to drop out of college. I created\na hugely successful website, only to get hated for the work I did. I helped\nproduce documentaries, only to then get doxed by the same people who worked\nwith me. I co-authored journal papers that made waves in the academic world,\nonly to get my dataset stolen.\n\nI'm not even sure what to write anymore. I have a lot of wisdom stemming from\na lot of crisis and pain, but seems there's no place for me to belong or to\nhelp humanity.\n\nThat's it. That's the post.\n\nPowered by Bear \u0295\u2022\u1d25\u2022\u0294\n\n", "frontpage": false}
