It\u2019s not like most such articles \u2014 often decrying\njust how much disinformation is flowing out there, but rather taking a very\ncritical eye about how we (especially the media) talk about such things. The\npiece is thought-provoking and well worth reading, and I\u2019ve spent the last\nweek or so letting it sit and percolate in my head before writing up this post\nabout it.\n\nRight after the 2016 election, there was a flurry of hand-wringing from the\nmedia, trying to understand how what they were positive would happen (a\nHillary Clinton victory and a Donald Trump loss), didn\u2019t actually happen. A\nconvenient scapegoat for this surprising turn of events was... Facebook. The\nnarrative took over that it was \u201cfake news\u201d on Facebook that convinced a bunch\nof gullible people to support a clearly unqualified candidate. That this\nconvenient scapegoat also happened to be successfully siphoning advertising\ndollars away from some traditional media organizations was mostly just made\npointing fingers at it feel even better. However, as we warned at the time,\nfocusing in on social media and \u201cfake news\u201d was not just silly, but\npotentially counterproductive. Indeed, within weeks, authoritarians around the\nworld started adopting the term \u201cfake news\u201d as a convenient excuse for\ncensoring the media. And, obviously, it became a key part of Donald Trump\u2019s\nstump speech as well.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long until \u201cfake news\u201d was used against any content someone in power\ndidn\u2019t like, and it became a key tool to push for censorship of those who were\nactually exposing malfeasance.\n\nBernstein\u2019s article highlights how this same sort of thinking is happening\nwith the term \u201cdisinformation.\u201d Of course, disinformation doesn\u2019t have a clear\ndefinition, and often it\u2019s in the eye of the beholder (like \u201cfake news\u201d before\nit). But, the media (and many politicians) have become so obsessed with\n\u201cdisinformation\u201d that, once again, we\u2019ve turned it into a kind of moral panic\n\u2014 and a convenient one for censors around the globe. As Bernstein notes, the\nhue and cry over \u201cdisinformation\u201d has made many Americans think it\u2019s one of\nthe biggest threats around:\n\n> Everyone scrounges this wasteland for tainted morsels of content, and it?s\n> impossible to know exactly what anyone else has found, in what condition,\n> and in what order. Nevertheless, our American is sure that what her fellow\n> citizens are reading and watching is bad. According to a 2019 Pew survey,\n> half of Americans think that ?made-up news/info? is ?a very big problem in\n> the country today,? about on par with the ?U.S. political system,? the ?gap\n> between rich and poor,? and ?violent crime.? But she is most worried about\n> disinformation, because it seems so new, and because so new, so isolable,\n> and because so isolable, so fixable. It has something to do, she knows, with\n> the algorithm.\n\nAn important (and often overlooked!) point that Bernstein makes in the piece\nis that the big internet companies were pretty quick to embrace this idea that\n\u201cdisinformation\u201d is a problem. It is true that Mark Zuckerberg initially\npushed back on the idea, but after basically everyone attacked him for that,\nhe quickly began his apology tour. And, why not? Even as it makes the company\nlook bad in the narrative, at its core, the idea that disinformation on\nFacebook impacted the American election can be spun to be positive for\nFacebook. After all, if Facebook is so powerful, shouldn\u2019t you be advertising\non it, Mr. Toilet Paper maker? If Facebook can help get Trump elected because\nof some memes posted by idiots, just think how much beer and nachos it can\nsell as well? Literally, Facebook has a vested interest in having people\nbelieve that disinformation works on its platform, because that\u2019s literally\nsomething the company can profit from.\n\n> Denial was always untenable, for Zuckerberg in particular. The so-called\n> techlash, a season of belatedly brutal media coverage and political pressure\n> in the aftermath of Brexit and Trump?s win, made it difficult. But\n> Facebook?s basic business pitch made denial impossible. Zuckerberg?s company\n> profits by convincing advertisers that it can standardize its audience for\n> commercial persuasion. How could it simultaneously claim that people aren?t\n> persuaded by its content? Ironically, it turned out that the big social-\n> media platforms shared a foundational premise with their strongest critics\n> in the disinformation field: that platforms have a unique power to influence\n> users, in profound and measurable ways. Over the past five years, these\n> critics helped shatter Silicon Valley?s myth of civic benevolence, while\n> burnishing its image as the ultra-rational overseer of a consumerist future.\n>\n> Behold, the platforms and their most prominent critics both proclaim:\n> hundreds of millions of Americans in an endless grid, ready for\n> manipulation, ready for activation. Want to change an output?say, an\n> insurrection, or a culture of vaccine skepticism? Change your input. Want to\n> solve the ?crisis of faith in key institutions? and the ?loss of faith in\n> evidence-based reality?? Adopt a better content-moderation policy. The fix,\n> you see, has something to do with the algorithm.\n\nBut... is it actually true? Are most Americans actually gullible suckers who\nwill fall for any piece of made up nonsense that gives them a dopamine hit? As\nBernstein\u2019s piece explores, the American advertising industry has spent\ndecades pushing this very notion \u2014 even putting forth various industry-\nsupported studies to \u201cprove\u201d it. Whether or not those studies are accurate\nportrayals of reality is another question, but if they\u2019re not, well, wouldn\u2019t\nthat create quite a paradox? The disinformation from questionable studies\nabout how it\u2019s possible to manipulate people into believing things worked \u2014 so\neven if the studies are inaccurate, there\u2019s at least one example of how their\nown \u201cdisinformation\u201d had an impact. And, as Bernstein does highlight, much of\nthat early research on how easy it is to manipulate people with ads was...\nhighly questionable.\n\n> The profitable relationship between the ad industry and the soft sciences\n> took on a dark cast in 1957, when the journalist Vance Packard published The\n> Hidden Persuaders, his expos? of ?motivation research??then the bleeding\n> edge of collaboration between Madison Avenue and research psychology. The\n> alarming public image Packard?s bestseller created?ad men wielding some\n> unholy concoction of Pavlov and Freud to manipulate the American public into\n> buying toothpaste?is still with us today. And the idea of the manipulability\n> of the public is, as Arendt noted, an indispensable part of the product.\n> Advertising is targeted at consumers, but sold to businesses.\n>\n> Packard?s reporting was based on what motivation researchers told him. Among\n> their own motivations, hardly hidden, was a desire to appear clairvoyant. In\n> a late chapter, Packard admits as much:\n>\n\n>> Some of the researchers were sometimes prone to oversell themselves?or in a\nsense to exploit the exploiters. John Dollard, [a] Yale psychologist doing\nconsulting work for industry, chided some of his colleagues by saying that\nthose who promise advertisers ?a mild form of omnipotence are well received.?\n\nSo, the public (and the media and politicians) have been primed \u2014 with\ndisinformation \u2014 to believe that disinformation works. And the big internet\ncompanies have their own vested interest in continuing that belief, even if\nit\u2019s not quite true.\n\n> The media narrative of sinister digital mind control has obscured a body of\n> research that is skeptical about the effects of political advertising and\n> disinformation. A 2019 examination of thousands of Facebook users by\n> political scientists at Princeton and NYU found that ?sharing articles from\n> fake news domains was a rare activity??more than 90 percent of users had\n> never shared any. A 2017 Stanford and NYU study concluded that\n>\n\n>> if one fake news article were about as persuasive as one TV campaign ad,\nthe fake news in our database would have changed vote shares by an amount on\nthe order of hundredths of a percentage point. This is much smaller than\nTrump?s margin of victory in the pivotal states on which the outcome depended.\n\nBut, of course, part of the problem is that \u2014 like \u201cfake news\u201d before it \u2014\nthere is no easy definition of \u201cdisinformation,\u201d and thus the research on it\nisn\u2019t always talking about the same thing.\n\n> The most comprehensive survey of the field to date, a 2018 scientific\n> literature review titled ?Social Media, Political Polarization, and\n> Political Disinformation,? reveals some gobsmacking deficits. The authors\n> fault disinformation research for failing to explain why opinions change;\n> lacking solid data on the prevalence and reach of disinformation; and\n> declining to establish common definitions for the most important terms in\n> the field, including disinformation, misinformation, online propaganda,\n> hyperpartisan news, fake news, clickbait, rumors, and conspiracy theories.\n> The sense prevails that no two people who research disinformation are\n> talking about quite the same thing.\n>\n> This will ring true to anyone who follows the current media discussion\n> around online propaganda. ?Misinformation? and ?disinformation? are used\n> casually and interchangeably to refer to an enormous range of content,\n> ranging from well-worn scams to viral news aggregation; from foreign-\n> intelligence operations to trolling; from opposition research to harassment.\n> In their crudest use, the terms are simply jargon for ?things I disagree\n> with.? Attempts to define ?disinformation? broadly enough as to rinse it of\n> political perspective or ideology leave us in territory so abstract as to be\n> absurd.\n\nAnother key point that Bernstein highlights is why \u201cdisinformation\u201d is such a\nconvenient term for the traditional media. After all, for decades they\u2019ve\npushed the idea that they\u2019re the ones pushing \u201cobjective truth\u201d and taking a\nview from nowhere. So they\u2019re the ones who are supposed to save us from\ndisinformation. When you\u2019ve positioned yourself as the gatekeeper for truth,\nit helps to play up the constant threat of untruths. As Bernstein notes:\n\n> A quick scan of the institutions that publish most frequently and\n> influentially about disinformation: Harvard University, the New York Times,\n> Stanford University, MIT, NBC, the Atlantic Council, the Council on Foreign\n> Relations, etc. That the most prestigious liberal institutions of the pre-\n> digital age are the most invested in fighting disinformation reveals a lot\n> about what they stand to lose, or hope to regain. Whatever the brilliance of\n> the individual disinformation researchers and reporters, the nature of the\n> project inevitably places them in a regrettably defensive position in the\n> contemporary debate about media representation, objectivity, image-making,\n> and public knowledge. However well-intentioned these professionals are, they\n> don?t have special access to the fabric of reality.\n\nAnd they sure do seem eager to put in place official arbiters of truth:\n\n> Still, Big Disinfo can barely contain its desire to hand the power of\n> disseminating knowledge back to a set of ?objective? gatekeepers. In\n> February, the tech news website Recode reported on a planned $65 million\n> nonpartisan news initiative called the Project for Good Information. Its\n> creator, Tara McGowan, is a veteran Democratic operative and the CEO of\n> Acronym, a center-left digital-advertising and voter-mobilization nonprofit\n> whose PAC is funded by, among others, Steven Spielberg, the LinkedIn co-\n> founder Reid Hoffman, and the venture capitalist Michael Moritz. The former\n> Obama campaign manager David Plouffe, currently a strategist at the Chan\n> Zuckerberg Initiative, is an official Acronym adviser. Meanwhile, a February\n> New York Times article humbly suggested the appointment of a ?reality czar?\n> who could ?become the tip of the spear for the federal government?s response\n> to the reality crisis.?\n\nIf you step back, you can absolutely see the thinking here, though it\u2019s\ndifficult to see any path by which it is actually effective. It only does make\nsense if it really is true that false info on Facebook really fried many\npeople\u2019s brains \u2014 rather than a much larger, and much more complex series of\nvariables that have all contributed to large segments of the society being\nopen to crazy ideas and conspiracy theories. What\u2019s notable in all of this is\nhow ready many people are to believe that a meme on Facebook magically\nconvinced their aunt to believe in the dumbest conspiracy theories, but\nsomehow they, themselves, are miraculously immune to such things.\n\nNone of this is to argue that conspiracy theories and those who push them are\nnot a problem. Clearly it\u2019s a part of the problem, but we\u2019re so focused on the\nsymptoms that we see, rather than the underlying causes, that we get wrapped\nup in bad ideas that sound good from a narrative perspective, but will have no\nreal impact on the solution.\n\nFor years I\u2019ve tried to highlight that what we see \u2014 what Facebook and other\nsocial media has exposed \u2014 is often the consequences of huge societal\nfailings. There are problems with education, with social safety nets, with\nhealthcare (especially mental healthcare). There are problems with income\ninequality and corruption. There are tons of problems out there, and many of\nthese manifest themselves through false information that people share online.\nBut saying that the \u201cdisinformation\u201d is the problem \u2014 rather than a way in\nwhich the underlying problem shows itself \u2014 misses the point entirely.\n\nAnd Bernstein\u2019s article really does a great job calling this out. Is\ndisinformation real? Sure, though what it actually is remains amorphous. But\nthe focus on treating disinformation as the problem, rather than simply an\nexposed symptom of a much deeper, much more complex, much more troubling\nunderlying societal ill, is missing the point.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot more in Bernstein\u2019s piece, and I really recommend reading the\nwhole thing. He doesn\u2019t necessarily come to the same conclusion I come to\nhere, but it really includes a lot of useful thinking about how we\u2019ve over-\nindexed on disinformation as the problem when it\u2019s not at all clear that it\nreally is the problem. Indeed, it\u2019s easy to come away from the article and\nrealize that there\u2019s an awful lot of, er... disinformation about\ndisinformation. The problem is not Facebook. The problem is that Facebook is\nshining a light on a whole bunch of other terrible shit.\n\n> Only certain types of people respond to certain types of propaganda in\n> certain situations. The best reporting on QAnon, for example, has taken into\n> account the conspiracy movement?s popularity among white evangelicals. The\n> best reporting about vaccine and mask skepticism has taken into account the\n> mosaic of experiences that form the American attitude toward the expertise\n> of public-health authorities. There is nothing magically persuasive about\n> social-media platforms; they are a new and important part of the picture,\n> but far from the whole thing. Facebook, however much Mark Zuckerberg and\n> Sheryl Sandberg might wish us to think so, is not the unmoved mover.\n>\n> For anyone who has used Facebook recently, that should be obvious. Facebook\n> is full of ugly memes and boring groups, ignorant arguments, sensational\n> clickbait, products no one wants, and vestigial features no one cares about.\n> And yet the people most alarmed about Facebook?s negative influence are\n> those who complain the most about how bad a product Facebook is.

Why have we been so eager to accept Silicon\n> Valley?s story about how easy we are to manipulate?\n\nNone of this means that manipulation never works. Or that people are not\npersuadable. Of course people are persuadable. But not in the way that many\npeople think. It\u2019s not because of a random meme that make people embrace crazy\nideas about vaccines or 5G. There needs to be much more infrastructure and\nissues for people to be susceptible. And, as Bernstein notes, perhaps the most\nmanipulated are those who feel they need to believe in this story of\n\u201cdisinformation\u201d to explain away all of their other failures to build a better\nsociety:\n\n> Indeed, it?s possible that the Establishment needs the theater of social-\n> media persuasion to build a political world that still makes sense, to\n> explain Brexit and Trump and the loss of faith in the decaying institutions\n> of the West. The ruptures that emerged across much of the democratic world\n> five years ago called into question the basic assumptions of so many of the\n> participants in this debate?the social-media executives, the scholars, the\n> journalists, the think tankers, the pollsters.

More than that, it\n> creates a world of persuasion that is legible and useful to capital?to\n> advertisers, political consultants, media companies, and of course, to the\n> tech platforms themselves. It is a model of cause and effect in which the\n> information circulated by a few corporations has the total power to justify\n> the beliefs and behaviors of the demos. In a way, this world is a kind of\n> comfort. Easy to explain, easy to tweak, and easy to sell, it is a worthy\n> successor to the unified vision of American life produced by twentieth-\n> century television.\n\nBut I\u2019d take that even a step further. Many of the \u201cEstablishment\u201d that are\npushing this are also the people whose previous policies failed. The reason we\nhave so many societal problems are because their beliefs about their own\npolicy powers and what they could accomplish in the past did not work the way\nthey expected. The world did not progress the way they planned. And thus,\npushing the \u201coh it\u2019s social media and disinformation\u201d button not only gives\nthem a convenient story, it also absolves themselves of their own failures.\n\nI recognize that this can be read to be saying that Facebook isn\u2019t a problem.\nOr that \u201cdisinformation\u201d and false info isn\u2019t a problem. But that\u2019s not what I\nam saying at all (and I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not what Bernstein is saying\neither). It\u2019s just that the world is a lot more complicated than that. What\nwe\u2019re seeing on Facebook and the flow of disinformation is a problem \u2014 but\nit\u2019s not a problem you solve by sweeping it under the rug. It\u2019s a mirror on\nthe real underlying societal problems the world faces \u2014 which we should be\ntalking about and trying to come up with better solutions for, rather than\ninsisting that Facebook can make it all go away if only they had a better\nalgorithm or better employees.\n\nFiled Under: cable news, content moderation, disinformation, fake news, finger\npointing, media literacy, misinformation, newspapers, propaganda, social media\n\n29 CommentsLeave a Comment\n\nIf you liked this post, you may also be interested in...\n\n  * Ctrl-Alt-Speech: Watch Out, AI Is Getting More Persuasive\n  * Company At Center Of Sports Illustrated, Gannett 'AI' Content Scandals Continues To Fail Upward\n  * Bureau Of Prisons Seeking To Criminalize Social Media Access By Inmates\n  * Ninth Circuit Dumps Three More 'Sue Twitter Because Terrorism' Lawsuits\n  * Both Things Can Be True: Meta Can Be Evil AND It's Unlikely That The Company Deliberately Blocked A Mildly Negative Article About It\n\nClick to toggle\n\nRate this comment as insightful\n\nRate this comment as funny\n\nYou have rated this comment as insightful\n\nYou have rated this comment as funny\n\nFlag this comment as abusive/trolling/spam\n\nYou have flagged this comment\n\nThe first word has already been claimed\n\nThe last word has already been claimed\n\n## Comments on \u201cMost Information About Disinformation Is Misinformation\u201d\n\nSubscribe: RSS Leave a comment\n\n29 Comments\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nThis comment has been flagged by the community.

I brought my telescope which made me popular, and it was great letting other people look through it\n  * John Roddy: It was so overcast for me that I legit couldn't even see clouds.\n  * mildconcern: I wasn't really aiming to take pictures primarily but I did get a few\n  * John Roddy: Just a perfectly homogenous gray.\n  * mildconcern: https://www.instagram.com/p/C5jo...\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/C5jo_1bvI0S/?igsh=cW85dnc5czF4Zzg4\n\n  * Mike Masnick: Heh. Yeah, the park we were in had fixed bathrooms (and even cleaned them right after the eclipse so we had clean bathrooms to use before heading out) and a big row of porta potties, but neither ever got crowded. there was a *good* sized crowd but never got crowded\n  * The one thing we didn't really have where we were was a good view of the 360 degree sunset. I remember that from the last one we saw. but didn't really see it this time due to trees around the park.\n  * You should have driven over to where we were! No traffic, very few clouds.\n  * mildconcern: yeah I did not have as good a view of the 360 as I did in Casper Wyoming. It was pretty good and you got a sense of it because we were on a lakeshore but the other angles were mountains\n  * John Roddy: Unfortunately, I had a dentist appointment at just barely after the right time. :/\n  * Which is the only reason I'm able to eat anything again.\n  * Mike Masnick: we really lucked out in 2017, because we found this random hill in the middle of absolute nowhere, eastern oregon, that gave us a 360 degrees view of NOTHING but fields from the top. It was a perfect spot to watch\n  * John Roddy: They had to try like 20 different times to get the right set of x-rays.\n  * Mike Masnick: Yikes.\n  * John Roddy: So I'm expecting to grow a second tongue within the next few days or something.\n  * Interestingly, x-ray tech has finally been miniaturized enough that the camera is entirely handheld now.\n  * The tube just has a really thick glass shield lining the end of it, presumably lined with lead.\n  * deadspatula: Fascinatingly, the big advancement has been in better dosing, not simply the size of components. The big machines needed a big burst and leaked a lot of x-rays. That's why the dentist had to hide behind the lead wall and we covered the reproductive organs - the dose wasn't bad once every six months, but multiple times a day would be serious. And the units therefore needed to be mounted. The handheld units better direct a much lower dose, and manufacturers claim technicians do not get dangerous doses of stray x-rays. That said, the notable property of x-rays is penetration. Many of the units I've seen have a guard as you describe, but nothing opaque, and if its not opaque its not lined with enough lead to matter.\n  * John Roddy: Lead lined glass is almost certainly more than enough to at least scatter any stray x-rays that find their way back.\n  * But yeah, x-ray tech in general got a pretty significant overhaul in the past decade or so.\n  * When Chandra launched in '99, it was the heaviest payload the shuttle ever carried.\n  * Fast forward to '21, and we've got IXPE.\n  * Chandra is close to 6,000kg.\n  * IXPE is just over 300.\n  * mildconcern: I wonder how much the general advancement of detectors driven by the cell phone camera revolution has spilled over. That certainly has helped the field of astronomical detection quite a bit.\n  * Digital sensors that had laughable resolution used to cost a fortune in the 1990s when they started to come out. And now you can get miracle devices for far less.\n  * John Roddy: Cell phone stuff is all in the microwave range.\n  * That's most useful for detecting the cosmic microwave background, which is probably the closest thing to a natural encyclopedia we're ever going to get.\n  * mildconcern: phone cameras also do sense visual light\n  * John Roddy: I feel like everyone I tell this to is hearing it for the first time, but...\n  * I *thought* it was common knowledge that your phone camera is pretty good at seeing infrared too.\n  * It's a really quick and easy way to check if a remote control is working.\n  * Infrared LEDs *will* be visible through the sensor.\n  * mildconcern: Oh yeah I knew that, I was just being a wiseass\n  * it's not hugely far in the infrared spectrum\n  * can't use it as a heat detector or something. Just a smidge.\n  * but I'm mostly saying in terms of astronomy applications. The overall success in designing sensors and detectors in smaller scales has hugely helped anyway\n  * no matter the wavelengths\n  * John Roddy: Yeah, the interesting stuff requires some pretty intense tech.\n  * Almost everything glows in the infrared spectrum, after all.\n  * mildconcern: It's a big part of why they stuck the JWT in space\n  * since it's mostly working in that range\n  * John Roddy: That's only half the story\n  * Spritzer needed some pretty extreme shielding too.\n  * Except the tech wasn't *quite* ready to make the active cooling reliable enough.\n  * A lot of people think of \"cold\" in terms of what chilly weather feels like on earth.\n  * The cold air sucks the heat right out of you.\n  * But space doesn't have that air.\n  * So despite space being extremely cold, it's actually really hard to cool things down out there.\n  * The reason the space shuttle always had the bay doors open in orbit is because that's where the radiators were.\n  * mildconcern: yeah. but the IR wavelengfths that JWT are detecting can't even get through at all even in Earth orbit\n  * so that's why it's out at the Lagrange Point\n  * Despite the \"can't fuck this one up and fix it later\" nature of that as opposed to Hubble\n  * John Roddy: It's not even *at* the Lagrange point\n  * It's in an orbit around it\n\nBecome an Insider!\n\nRecent Stories\n\n## Saturday  \n  \n---  \n12:00| This Week In Techdirt History: April 7th - 13th (1)  \n  \n## Friday  \n  \n19:39| Court Rules For Paramount In Lawsuit Over 'Top Gun' Movies (15)  \n14:20| Ctrl-Alt-Speech: Watch Out, AI Is Getting More Persuasive (2)  \n12:56| Microsoft Warns That China Wants To Use AI To Disrupt Elections; But\nBasically Ignores Its Failures To Disrupt The Taiwanese Election (34)  \n10:54| Cops Battered A Man Suffering A Seizure, Cooked Up Criminal Charges To\nCover Up Their Actions (95)  \n10:51| Daily Deal: 2-in-1 Keychain Wireless Charger for iPhone and Apple Watch\n(0)  \n09:26| Once Again, ExTwitter Makes Links Dangerous; The Kind Of Thing A Trust\n& Safety Team Would Catch (36)  \n05:22| The FCC's New 'Broadband Nutrition Label' Doesn't Solve The Actual\nProblem: Unchecked Telecom Monopoly Power (13)  \n  \n## Thursday  \n  \n20:13| No, The Internet Hasn\u2019t Gotten Worse: Just Your Outlook (76)  \n15:16| Apple App Store Update Says Emulation Is Coming Back.
