Pretty much everyone who has R / M HNSCC\ndies, and R / M HNSCC doesn\u2019t readily respond to treatment, so anything with\neffectiveness like this is important.\n\nStill, this is not so great: \u201cAbout 27% of those receiving the vaccine showed\nan overall response rate, or ORR, with 3.4 months of progression-free\nsurvival, or PFS, and 24.6 months of overall survival, or OS.\u201d Having only\nthree and a half extra months without tumor progression is good, but not\nsomething like, say, three years. And surviving 24.6 months is nice\u2014the R / M\nHNSCC median lifespan is just twelve months after diagnosis\u2014but could, again,\nbe longer. Moreover, on a personal level, if I\u2019m going to survive I need\naccess as soon as possible, and, at least as of January, one oncologist who\nworks closely with Moderna told me she\u2019s not aware of any phase 2 trial\nplanned for 2024. That was three months ago, so things might\u2019ve changed since.\n\nI also note this, from the poster presentation: \u201cPart C of this study enrolled\npatients \u00ac18 years old with checkpoint inhibitor (CPI)-naive, recurrent /\nmetastatic HPV- HNSCC.\u201d \u201cCPI-na\u00efve\u201d means patients who haven\u2019t receive\npembrolizumab (Keytruda), which I have. If the phase 2 trial also requires\nthat I be CPI-na\u00efve, I\u2019ll be out of luck. While phase 2 drugs can sometimes be\npetitioned for compassionate use if a terminal patient doesn\u2019t qualify for a\ntrial, it\u2019s less likely that a personalized, tumor-specific treatment that\nrequires more intensive preparation than, say, mailing an IV bag of a batch-\nproduced drug, will be acquirable.\n\nThere\u2019s another ominous phrase in the presentation, too: \u201cRandomized\nassessment of the mRNA-4157 + pembrolizumab treatment effect in the advanced\ndisease setting may be warranted.\u201d So there will probably be a placebo group\nthat gets only pembro, which I\u2019ve already failed.\n\nI don\u2019t understand why the results so far aren\u2019t enough for accelerated FDA\napproval, given the grim prognosis for R / M HNSCC, the limited treatments\navailable, and the safety of mRNA-4157. It could be that Moderna doesn\u2019t have\nthe capacity to mass produce mRNA vaccines yet\u2014the company is building a\nfactory in Massachusetts that won\u2019t come online until 2025\u2014though that article\nalso notes that \u201cIn 2018, the company opened a $110 million, 200,000-square-\nfoot mRNA plant in Norwood.\u201d Part of the approval process could I guess be\nproving not only efficacy, but the ability to mass-produce the vaccine; so\nModerna won\u2019t file paperwork for approval until the facility is running, which\nmeans that patients like myself, who so desperately need better treatment\noptions now, will likely not be running at all by then, having run out of\ntime.\n\nRight now I\u2019m about to begin a clinical trial of Seagen\u2019s PDL1V antibody drug\nconjugate, which is good, though it\u2019s unclear whether I\u2019ll get dosed soon\nenough for PDL1V to work well enough to stop the tumors in my neck from\nbreaching critical structures. Knowing what I know now, I probably should\u2019ve\ngotten chemo immediately upon getting the tumor-growth news on March 13. But I\ndidn\u2019t for somewhat complex reasons I\u2019ll explain in the next essay\u2014primarily\nbecause PDL1V, like many clinical trials, has an arbitrary-seeming limit on\nthe number of \u201csystemic therapies\u201d a patient can have undergone. Cruelly, the\nclinicaltrials.gov page for PDL1V doesn\u2019t even appear to list a lines-of-\ntherapy limitation, which means patients like me have to call sites to\neventually get the news. That should be publicly stated, so as not to waste\neveryone\u2019s time. But \u201cwasting time\u201d is normal, though maddening, in clinical\ntrials. Ultimately, the time that matters to the sponsoring drug companies is\nnot the patient\u2019s, but the persnickety FDA\u2019s.\n\nOverall, we should be working to have drugs like mRNA-4157 get much, much\nfaster approval, rather than leaving people dead and dying at the gates of\noncology clinical trials. Particularly frustrating is the unavailability of\nmRNA-4157 when considered with the other highly promising, low-side-effect,\nunavailable drugs in the pipeline: petosemtamab / MCLA-158 (which I just\nfailed), Purple Biotech\u2019s NT219 small molecule, the Seagen (now Pfizer) ADCs\nlike PDL1V.\n\nThe real benefit is likely to come by combining therapies with differing\nmechanisms of action. Getting mRNA-4157 or petosemtamab or PDL1v as\nmonotherapies or duotherapies is nice, but R / M HNSCC has time to adapt to\nand defeat treatment. Using multiple drugs at once might make a larger number\nof \u201ccomplete responses\u201d\u2014cures\u2014conceivable. Instead, playing whack-a-mole with\ncancer by trying a new drug every time an old drug pressures the cancer to\nmutate, creates a recursive loop until there are no more drugs to try, or the\nnext drug doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s possible, though unlikely, that some unforeseen\ninteraction among treatments will prove fatal, but so what? R / M HNSCC is\nalready fatal. I should have the right to try, without the FDA blocking me and\nthousands of other dying patients. We need faster treatments, not more trials\nthat let the dying languish.\n\nIn other HNSCC news, Transgene is moving its personalized vaccine to a phase 2\ntrial. That vaccine targeted at patients who have an initial surgery and then\nwant to prevent recurrence; in the phase 1 trial, patients \u201cwere randomized to\none of two treatment arms: one in which patients received repeated injections\nof the personalized vaccine as an additional adjuvant therapy and another in\nwhich they did not receive any additional adjuvant therapy.\u201d No patients who\nreceived the vaccine relapsed; three of those who didn\u2019t, did. \u201cRoughly 40\npercent of head and neck cancer patients are expected to experience cancer\nrecurrence within two years of surgery and adjuvant therapy, according to\nTransgene.\u201d If that TG4050 vaccine had been available in October 2022, when I\nhad my initial surgery, I\u2019d probably still have a tongue, be able to work, and\nlook forward to spending years if not decades with Bess. Instead, every day is\na fight and every month I\u2019m alive a surprise. The technology exists but we\u2019re\nslow-walking it to patients, which is insane.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Share\n\n  * Email\n  * Facebook\n  * Reddit\n  * Twitter\n  * Print\n\nLike
