Unfortunately, having had a few things\nthat have gone on in my life that have led me to make these decisions and\npost-traumatic stress disorder, I do suffer [with my] mental health as well.\n\n\"And so that's [ketamine] kind of been my turn-to.\"\n\nBeth is now struggling with the physical impact of prolonged use as well.\n\nHer ketamine use caused a big growth in her bladder, which had to be burnt\naway, and she also says the drug could be seen floating in her urine on a\nhospital camera screen, when she was seen by urologists.\n\n## What is ketamine?\n\nKetamine is widely used in the NHS as an anaesthetic, sedative and pain\nreliever, and is also commonly used on animals.\n\nBecause of its hallucinogenic effects, it is also thought of as a \"party\ndrug\".\n\nIt was the main reason cited in the accidental death of Friends star Matthew\nPerry\n\nKnown on the street as Special K, it usually comes as a crystalline powder or\nliquid.\n\nGetty Images\n\nKetamine was one of the major factors in the death of Friends TV star Matthew\nPerry\n\nKetamine is classed by the government as a Class-B drug, which means it is\nillegal to take, carry, make or sell.\n\nTolerance is known to build quickly, so users increasingly need more and more\nto feel an effect.\n\nChronic usage affects the lining of the bladder, and can shrink it.\n\nThis can lead to frequency in needing to urinate, infections, bleeding,\nblockages and incontinence.\n\n## 'Very serious consequences'\n\nDr Mohammed Belal is from the British Association of Urological Surgeons,\nwhich is now putting together a document to help other health professionals\nspot the signs of 'ketamine bladder'.\n\n\"I think we've seen a huge explosion of young people taking ketamine\nthroughout the country, and that means that they come to see us with a\nsignificant urinary symptoms and these symptoms can include going to the\ntoilet every hour or even every half an hour,\" he said.\n\n\"Ketamine destroys the lining of the bladder, and that can have very serious\nconsequences.\n\n\"We've noticed lots of young patients with severe bladder problems that we\nwould not expect to see until patients are much older.\"\n\nPagan has recovered from a 12-year addiction to ketamine\n\nPagan, from Oxfordshire, has now recovered from a 12-year addiction to\nketamine, and is using her experience to try and help others get clean.\n\nAt her worst point she said she was taking more than 10 grams a day.\n\n## 'I wanted to die'\n\n\"I wanted to die, yeah, I just didn't want to be alive anymore,\" she said.\n\n\"I didn't want to be in the world in that pain - completely reliant on\nketamine.\"\n\nAs a result of her addiction Pagan's daughter was adopted, she had bladder\nsurgery and ended up going to rehab for the third time in 2022.\n\n\"I spent eight weeks in hospital and I kind of felt like I tempted fate too\nmany times, so I needed to give it up, otherwise I would have would have ended\nup dead.\"\n\nPagan is now a peer mentor for other people struggling with addiction\n\nShe says her journey to recovery was \"really, really difficult\" at first, and\nshe couldn't have done it without the support of drug and alcohol charity\nTurning Point, where she now volunteers as a peer mentor.\n\n## 'It's never too late'\n\nIn a statement the UK government told the BBC it is committed to offering\nsupport and tackling the supply of illegal drugs.\n\nJasmine King is a specialist urologist nurse at Southmead Hospital, working to\nhelp people struggling with the impacts of chronic ketamine use.\n\nShe describes the increase in patients as \"very concerning\" and urges people\nto seek support through drug charities, mental health services and hospitals\nif needed.\n\n\"One thing I want to make people aware of is if they do come and see us, we\nare not judging them,\" she said.\n\n\"We're here to support them and help them with their problems. We just want to\nhelp.\"\n\nAs for Pagan, she says: \"No matter how much you think it's taken your life,\nit's never too late to reach out for help.\"\n\nYou can watch 'Young and addicted: Generation Ketamine\" on BBC iPlayer now.\n\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this article, you can\nfind advice here.\n\nFollow BBC West on Facebook, X and Instagram.
