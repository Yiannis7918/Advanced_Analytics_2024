And with\nKubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe ending a couple of weeks ago, we figured now\u2019s\nthe perfect time to ask some of our engineers which talks they enjoyed the\nmost across KubeCon and in the parallel co-located community days. Here\u2019s what\nthey said:\n\n## Shivtej Narake \u2013 Founding Engineer\n\nArchitecting Growth: Scaling Tactics for Prometheus Metrics Collection \u2013\nArthur Silva Sens & Nicolas Takashi, Coralogix (YouTube)\n\nBoth of my favorite talks were part of Observability Day. The reason I\u2019ve\npicked them is because I\u2019ve been working on very similar problems as we\u2019ve\nscaled ObserveNow over the last few years.\n\nFinding Needles in the Observability Haystack \u2013 Ivan Ne\u010das & Katya Gordeeva,\nRed Hat (YouTube)\n\nThe term \u201cObservability Intelligence\u201d really resonated with me here, and as I\nhave been playing around with data science libraries, Obsinthe is a tool that\nI\u2019ll definitely be exploring more going forward.\n\n## Aravind N \u2013 Founding Engineer\n\nDemystifying Argo Workflows: An Architectural Deep Dive \u2013 Darko Janji\u0107,\nPipekit & Becky Pauley (YouTube)\n\nThis is a perfect talk for beginners that intuitively explains what Argo\nWorkflows is: The architecture it is structured on, the building blocks, and\nfunctionalities it provides. If anyone is looking to explore Argo Workflows,\nthis talk paired with the project documentation is a really good starting\npoint.\n\nMastering Argo Workflows at Scale: A Practical Guide to Scalability Excellence\n\u2013 Tim Collins, Pipekit & Alec Stansell, Fetch Analytics (YouTube)\n\nWe use Argo Workflows frequently within OpsVerse\u2019s DeployNow to handle the\norchestration of complex workflows in Kubernetes (and we\u2019ve also been\nexperimenting with using it as a general-purpose workflow engine) as it allows\nusers to define a sequence of tasks and dependencies between them, enabling\nthe automation of multi-step processes. I liked this talk because it addresses\nscaling issues and provides a practical checklist to navigate the challenges\nof scaling Argo Workflows, ensuring the pipeline remains resilient.\n\nThe most interesting data point from the talk for me was when they spoke about\nscaling Argo Workflows from single-pod deployment to handling over 18,000+\npods per workflow that handle more than 500 billion data records!\n\n## Amogh Prakash \u2013 Founding Engineer\n\nDynamically Tuning Pods: Leveraging Time Series ML Models with KubeFlow \u2013\nChristopher Nuland (YouTube)\n\nCloud cost optimization is something that\u2019s crucial to most organizations and\nhas been a focus area for us at OpsVerse as well. I really enjoyed this talk\nbecause it presented an interesting approach to combining traditional\nstatistical methods with machine learning models to dynamically predict and\nadjust Kubernetes resource usage. Like the speaker, I also believe in the idea\nthat machine learning methods should be used to complement traditional methods\nrather than replace them outright. It\u2019s a recipe for success when building new\nsystems today.\n\n## Navin Pai \u2013 Founding Engineer\n\nReal-World Sampling \u2013 Lessons Learned After Reducing ~80% of Our O11y Costs \u2013\nJuraci Paix\u00e3o Kr\u00f6hling & Alexandre Magno Prado Machado (YouTube)\n\nSampling is a good example of a process that sounds quite straightforward in\ntheory, but opens up a can of worms in practice \u2013 especially as you scale\n(which is, ironically enough, also when sampling makes the most sense). We\u2019ve\nhad our fair share of (mis)adventures when building out sampling as a feature\nfor ObserveNow, so it was fun to hear folks talk about a lot of the same\nroadblocks we encountered and their approaches to solving them. In some cases,\nwe ended up with similar solutions; in others, we chose other tradeoffs. But\noverall, it was a really good talk for folks interested in exploring sampling\nand the challenges it presents.\n\nAI-Assisted Runbooks \u2013 Instigating Precision and Efficiency in Kubernetes\nOperations \u2013 Vinothini Raju (YouTube)\n\nSince we started building out Aiden, our North Star has always been to see how\nwe can leverage GenAI to build out human-in-the-loop workflows to augment\ninformation that SREs and DevOps teams have access to, and then build out a\nDevOps copilot that can learn from the environment it operates in and\nsimultaneously develop a symbiotic connection with the engineering team. The\nreason I chose this talk is because it discussed similar workflows for GenAI\nin the tangential domain of ITOps using a low-code platform (Paddle), and it\nwas nice to hear from others in the industry on how they are approaching GenAI\nuse cases where solution-verification is of utmost importance.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to learn more about the open-source based, fully managed, cloud\nagnostic, DevOps tool stacks that OpsVerse offers, read more about ObserveNow,\nDeployNow, and OpsVerse One. If you want to get a sneak peek at the exciting\nfuture of DevOps, check out our latest GenAI-based DevOps copilot, Aiden.\n\nShare\n\n#### Written by Udaya Kumar\n\nTable of Contents\n\nToggle\n\n## Latest Posts\n\n  * OpsVerse Engineers Discuss Their Favorite Talks from KubeCon 2024\n  * The Impact of Real User Monitoring: Capabilities and Benefits\n  * What is Real User Monitoring?
