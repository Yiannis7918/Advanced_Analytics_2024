IP over\nAvian Carriers was initially described in RFC 1149 issued by the Internet\nEngineering Task Force, written by David Waitzman, and released on April 1,\n1990. It is one of several April Fools' Day Request for Comments.\n\nWaitzman described an improvement of his protocol in RFC 2549, IP over Avian\nCarriers with Quality of Service (1 April 1999). Later, in RFC 6214\u2014released\non 1 April 2011, and 13 years after the introduction of IPv6\u2014Brian Carpenter\nand Robert Hinden published Adaptation of RFC 1149 for IPv6.^[1]\n\nIPoAC has been successfully implemented, but for only nine packets of data,\nwith a packet loss ratio of 55% (due to operator error),^[2] and a response\ntime ranging from 3,000 seconds (50 min) to over 6,000 seconds (100 min).\nThus, this technology suffers from high latency.^[3]\n\n## Real-life implementation\n\nOn 28 April 2001, IPoAC was implemented by the Bergen Linux user group, under\nthe name CPIP (for Carrier Pigeon Internet Protocol).^[4] They sent nine\npackets over a distance of approximately 5 km (3 mi), each carried by an\nindividual pigeon and containing one ping (ICMP echo request), and received\nfour responses.\n\n    \n    \n    Script started on Sat Apr 28 11:24:09 2001 $ /sbin/ifconfig tun0 tun0 Link encap:Point-to-Point Protocol inet addr:10.0.3.2 P-t-P:10.0.3.1 Mask:255.255.255.255 UP POINTOPOINT RUNNING NOARP MULTICAST MTU:150 Metric:1 RX packets:1 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0 TX packets:2 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0 collisions:0 RX bytes:88 (88.0 b) TX bytes:168 (168.0 b) $ ping -c 9 -i 900 10.0.3.1 PING 10.0.3.1 (10.0.3.1): 56 data bytes 64 bytes from 10.0.3.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=255 time=6165731.1 ms 64 bytes from 10.0.3.1: icmp_seq=4 ttl=255 time=3211900.8 ms 64 bytes from 10.0.3.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=255 time=5124922.8 ms 64 bytes from 10.0.3.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=255 time=6388671.9 ms --- 10.0.3.1 ping statistics --- 9 packets transmitted, 4 packets received, 55% packet loss round-trip min/avg/max = 3211900.8/5222806.6/6388671.9 ms Script done on Sat Apr 28 14:14:28 2001\n\nThis real life implementation was mentioned by the French member of parliament\nMartine Billard in the French National Assembly,^[5] during debates about\nHADOPI.\n\n## Risks\n\nIn December 2005, a Gartner report on bird flu that concluded \"A pandemic\nwouldn't affect IT systems directly\" was humorously criticized for neglecting\nto consider RFC 1149 and RFC 2549 in its analysis.^[6]\n\nKnown risks to the protocol include:\n\n  * Carriers being attacked by birds of prey. RFC2549: \"Unintentional encapsulation in hawks has been known to occur, with decapsulation being messy and the packets mangled.\"\n  * Carriers being blown off course. RFC1149: \"While broadcasting is not specified, storms can cause data loss.\"\n  * The absence of viable local carriers. RFC6214: \"In some locations, such as New Zealand, a significant proportion of carriers are only able to execute short hops, and only at times when the background level of photon emission is extremely low.\" This describes the flightless and nocturnal nature of kiwis.\n  * Loss of availability of species, such as the extinction of the passenger pigeon.\n  * Disease affecting the carriers. RFC6214: \"There is a known risk of infection by the so-called H5N1 virus.\"\n  * The network topologies supported for multicast communication are limited by the homing abilities of carriers. RFC6214: \"... [carriers] prove to have no talent for multihoming, and in fact enter a routing loop whenever multihoming is attempted.\"\n\n## Other avian data transfer methods\n\nRafting photographers already use pigeons as a sneakernet to transport digital\nphotos on flash media from the camera to the tour operator.^[7] Over a 30-mile\n(48 km) distance, a single pigeon may be able to carry tens of gigabytes of\ndata in around an hour, which on an average bandwidth basis compares very\nfavorably to current ADSL standards, even when accounting for lost drives.^[8]\n\nOn March 12, 2004, Yossi Vardi, Ami Ben-Bassat, and Guy Vardi sent three\nhoming pigeons a distance of 100 kilometres (62 mi), \"each carrying 20\u201322 tiny\nmemory cards containing 1.3 GB, amounting in total of 4 GB of data.\" An\neffective throughput of 2.27 Mbps was achieved. The purpose of the test was to\nmeasure and confirm an improvement over RFC 2549.^[8] Since the developers\nused flash memory instead of paper notes as specified by RFC 2549, the\nexperiment was widely criticized as an example in which an optimized\nimplementation breaks an official standard.^[citation needed]\n\nInspired by RFC 2549, on 9 September 2009, the marketing team of The\nUnlimited, a regional company in South Africa, decided to host a tongue-in-\ncheek pigeon race between their pet pigeon Winston and local telecom company\nTelkom SA. The race was to send 4 gigabytes of data from Howick to Hillcrest,\napproximately 60 kilometres (37 mi) apart. The pigeon carried a microSD card\nand competed against a Telkom ADSL line.^[9] Winston beat the data transfer\nover Telkom's ADSL line, with a total time of two hours, six minutes and 57\nseconds from uploading data on the microSD card to completion of download from\nthe card. At the time of Winston's victory, the ADSL transfer was just under\n4% complete.^[10]^[11]^[12]\n\nIn November 2009, the Australian comedy/current-affairs television program\nHungry Beast repeated this experiment. The Hungry Beast team took up the\nchallenge after a fiery parliament session wherein the government of the time\nblasted the opposition for not supporting telecommunications investments,\nsaying that if the opposition had their way, Australians would be doing data\ntransfer over carrier pigeons. The Hungry Beast team had read about the South\nAfrican experiment and assumed that, as a developed western country, Australia\nwould have higher speeds. The experiment had the team transfer a 700 MB file\nvia three delivery methods to determine which was the fastest: a carrier\npigeon with a microSD card, a car carrying a USB stick, and a Telstra\n(Australia's largest telecom provider) ADSL line. The data was to be\ntransferred from Tarana in rural New South Wales to the western-Sydney suburb\nof Prospect, New South Wales, a distance of 132 kilometres (82 mi) by road.\nApproximately halfway through the race, the internet connection unexpectedly\ndropped and the transfer had to be restarted. The pigeon won the race with a\ntime of approximately 1 hour 5 minutes, the car came in second at 2 hours 10\nminutes, while the internet transfer did not finish, having dropped out a\nsecond time and not coming back. The estimated time to upload completion at\none point was as high as 9 hours, and at no point did the estimated upload\ntime fall below 4 hours.^[13]\n\nA similar pigeon race was conducted in September 2010 by tech blogger\n(trefor.net) and ISP Timico CTO Trefor Davies with farmer Michelle Brumfield\nin rural Yorkshire, England: delivering a five-minute video to a BBC\ncorrespondent 75 miles away in Skegness. The pigeon (carrying a memory card\nwith a 300 MB HD video of Davies having a haircut) was pitted against an\nupload to YouTube via British Telecom broadband; the pigeon was released at\n11:05 am and arrived in the loft one hour and fifteen minutes later while the\nupload was still incomplete, having failed once in the interim.^[14]^[15]^[16]\n\n## See also\n\n  * Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol\n  * Pigeon post\n  * Semaphore Flag Signaling System\n  * Sneakernet\n\n## References\n\n  1. ^ B.
