I taught mathematical statistics at GSBS [1, 2] several times, and\neach time I taught it I became more aware of how pointless some of the\nmaterial was.\n\nI do believe mathematical statistics is useful, even some parts whose\nusefulness isn\u2019t immediately obvious, but there were other parts of the\ncurriculum I couldn\u2019t justify spending time on [3].\n\n## Fun and profit\n\nI\u2019ll say this in partial defense of computing precise answers to useless\nquestions: it can be fun and good for your career.\n\nMathematics problems coming out of statistics can be more interesting, and\neven more useful, than the statistical applications that motivate them.\nSeveral times in my former career a statistical problem of dubious utility\nlead to an interesting mathematical puzzle.\n\nSolving practical research problems in statistics is hard, and can be hard to\npublish. If research addresses a practical problem that a reviewer isn\u2019t aware\nof, a journal may reject it. The solution to a problem in mathematical\nstatistics, regardless of its utility, is easier to publish.\n\n## Private sector\n\nOutside of academia there is less demand for precise answers to useless\nquestions. A consultant can be sure that a client finds a specific project\nuseful because they\u2019re willing to directly spend money on it. Maybe the client\nis mistaken, but they\u2019re betting that they\u2019re not.\n\nAcademics get grants for various lines of research, but this isn\u2019t the same\nkind of feedback because the people who approve grants are not spending their\nown money. Imagine a grant reviewer saying \u201cI think this research is so\nimportant, I\u2019m not only going to approve this proposal, I\u2019m going to write the\napplicant a $5,000 personal check.\u201d\n\nConsulting clients may be giving away someone else\u2019s money too, but they have\na closer connection to the source of the funds than a bureaucrat has when\ndispensing tax money.\n\n## Notes\n\n[1] When I taught there, GSBS was The University of Texas Graduate School of\nBiomedical Sciences. I visited their website this morning, and apparently GSBS\nis now part of, or at least co-branded with, MD Anderson Cancer Center.\n\nThere was a connection between GSBS and MDACC at the time. Some of the GSBS\ninstructors, like myself, were MDACC employees who volunteered to teach a\nclass.\n\n[2] Incidentally, there was a connection between GSBS and Allen Downey: one of\nmy students was his former student, and he told me what a good teacher Allen\nwas.\n\n[3] I talk about utility a lot in this post, but I\u2019m not a utilitarian. There\nare good reasons to learn things that are not obviously useful. But the appeal\nof statistics is precisely its utility, and so statistics that isn\u2019t useful is\nparticularly distasteful.\n\nPure math is beautiful (and occasionally useful) and applied math is useful\n(and occasionally beautiful). But there\u2019s no reason to study fake applied math\nthat is neither beautiful or useful.\n\nCategories : Uncategorized\n\nBookmark the permalink\n\n## One thought on \u201cPrecise answers to useless questions\u201d\n\n  1.
