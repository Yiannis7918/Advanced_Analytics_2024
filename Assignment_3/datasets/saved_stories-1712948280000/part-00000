More years have\npassed since I spent time in Berlin\u2014supposedly to study German for grad\nschool, but in reality organized entirely around going to Tresor\u2014than I had\nbeen alive at the time.\n\nBecause I\u2019m here again on a reporting trip, I was speaking yesterday evening\nwith a former geophysicist who, when the Berlin Wall came down, found work\ndoing site-remediation studies and heritage-mapping projects on land beneath\nthe old path of the Wall. He was tasked with looking for environmental damage\nand unexploded ordnance, but also for older foundations and lost buildings,\nearlier versions of Berlin that might pose a structural threat to the city\u2019s\nfuture or that needed to be recorded for cultural posterity.\n\nIronically, in a phase of my life I rarely think about, I wrote my graduate\nthesis on almost exactly this topic, focused specifically on Potsdamer\nPlatz\u2014once divided by the Wall\u2014and the role of architectural drawings in\ncommunicating historical context. When I was first here, in 1998 into early\n1999, Potsdamer Platz was still a titanic hole in the ground, an abyss flooded\nwith groundwater, melted snow, and rain, a kind of maelstr\u00f6m you could walk\nover on pedestrian bridges, where engineering firms were busy stabilizing the\nearth for what would become today\u2019s corporate office parks.\n\nAs I told the former geophysicist last night, I remember hearing at the time\nthat there were people down there, SCUBA diving in the floodwaters, performing\ngeotechnical studies or welding rebar or looking for WWII bombs, I had no\nidea, but, whatever it was, their very existence took on an outsized\nimaginative role in my experience of the city. Berlin, destroyed by war,\ndivided by architecture, where people SCUBA dive through an artificial sea at\nits broken center. It felt like a mandala, a cosmic diagram, with this\ninverted Mt. Meru at its heart, not an infinite mountain but a bottomless pit.\n\nWhat was so interesting to me about Berlin at the time was that it felt like a\ntriple-exposure photograph, the city\u2019s future overlaid atop everything else in\na Piranesian haze of unbuilt architecture, whole neighborhoods yet to be\nconstructed, everything still possible, out of focus somehow. It was\nincoherent in an exhilaratingly literal sense. In Potsdamer Platz, what you\nthought was the surface of the Earth was actually a bridge; you were not\nstanding on the Earth at all, or at least not on earth. It was the\nAnthropocene in miniature, a kind of masquerade, architecture pretending to be\ngeology.\n\nThe more that was built, however, the more Berlin seemed to lose this inchoate\nappeal. The only people with the power to control the rebuilding process\nseemed to be automobile consortiums and international hotel groups, office-\nstrategy consultants not wizards and ghosts or backpacking writers. Perhaps\nthe city still feels like that to other people now\u2014unfinished, splintered,\njagged in a temporal sense, excitingly so, a city with its future still taking\nshape in the waves of an underground sea\u2014but it seems to me that Berlin\u2019s blur\nhas been misfocused.\n\nIn any case, with the caveat that I am in Berlin this week for a very specific\nresearch project, so many people I\u2019ve met have pointed to the fall of the Wall\nas an explosive moment for geophysical surveys in the East. Engineers were\nhired by the dozen to map, scan, and survey damaged ground left behind by a\ncollapsed imperialist Empire, and the residues of history, its chemical spills\nand lost foundations, its military bunkers and archaeological remains, needed\nto be recorded. The ground itself was a subject of study, an historical\nmedium. On top of that, new freeways were being built and expanded, heading\neast into Poland\u2014and this, too, required geophysical surveys. The future of\nthe region was, briefly, accessible only after looking down. The gateway to\nthe future was terrestrial, a question of gravel and sand, forgotten basements\nand fallen walls.\n\nThe SCUBA divers of the Potsdamer Sea now feel like mascots of that time,\ndream figures submerged in the waves of a future their work enabled, swimming\nthrough historical murk with limited visibility and, air tanks draining,\nlimited time. Their pit was soon filled, the hole annihilated, and the surface\nof the Earth\u2014which was actually architecture\u2014returned with amnesia.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n\n### Related\n\nTresorJanuary 24, 2007With 7 comments\n\nUndergroundMay 20, 2011With 8 comments\n\nPallet HouseAugust 22, 2010In \"Architecture\"\n\nAuthor Geoff ManaughPosted on June 14, 2022June 17, 2022Categories\nBLDGBLOGTags Anthropocene, Berlin, Cities, Earth, Geology, Geophysics, Ground,\nPotsdamer Platz, Subterranean, Underground\n\n## 8 thoughts on \u201cPotsdamer Sea\u201d\n\n  1. Federico Sanna says:\n\nJune 16, 2022 at 7:12 am\n\nIt\u2019s hard to list what DOESN\u2019T come to mind reading this post, whether\npersonal, public, or related to the deep roots and history of this very blog.\n\nI\u2019m not even going to try to write any sort of coherent comment. I\u2019m just\ngoing to list things: \u2013 your posts about and interviews with Lebbeus Woods,\napplied in this case to the Wall-less Berlin that could have been, a permanent\npost-war laboratory were geological and architectural layers fight to one-up\neach other; \u2013 Wenders\u2019 Potsdamer Platz in Der Himmel \u00fcber Berlin, with the\nWall cutting the ground and an elevated walkway cutting the air: both a one-\nway mirror to the captive East; \u2013 the Berlin I had been told about, in the mid\nto late Nineties, where raves and underground electronica seemed to have taken\nover everything, day morphing into night in a continuous drug-induced loop; \u2013\nthe Berlin I later saw, where Potsdamer Platz was already the sleek sanitized\nand oblivious affair it is now, with the Sony Center dominating the landscape,\nand a few hundred metres to the right, the Holocaust Memorial: memory goes\ndeeper into Berlin\u2019s sins of the past, but skips over the more recent ones\nthat cut it in two for almost three decades; \u2013 your typewriter, which I hope\nwas less mobile than Burroughs\u2019 one in Cronenberg\u2019s film; \u2013 SCUBA Divers! \u2013\nKabbalah. Apartments near Synagogues. Bronze Swords! I wonder how much magick\n(with and without a k) is left in the Berlin of today, which when I visited\nfor the first time I could only define as \u201cThe city with the largest number of\nfew people that I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d. \u2013 Before the pandemic, I kept going back at\nleast once a year, and every year found it more built, more clean, and with\nless magic.\n\nReply\n\n    1. Geoff Manaugh says:\n\nAugust 10, 2022 at 11:17 am\n\nThanks, Federico\u2014very sorry for the long-delayed reply. I think BLDGBLOG\u2014as\nyou potentially surmised here in your comment\u2014made a whole lot of sense (to\nme) back when I launched it, both biographically and (for me)\nintellectually/thematically; but, as you have likely also surmised here, that\noriginal context no longer exists. Blogging now has the feel of stuffing curls\nof paper into a brick wall in a meadow somewhere, an act of almost willed\nderangement rather than one of communication. But perhaps I\u2019ve fallen prey to\nage and cynicism. Thanks for the comment and for sticking around here over the\nyears!\n\nReply\n\n  2. greg says:\n\nJune 25, 2022 at 12:20 pm\n\nGlad you resurfaced here to write Potsdamer Sea, Geoff, you were missed.\n\nReply\n\n    1. Geoff Manaugh says:\n\nAugust 10, 2022 at 11:18 am\n\nCheers, Greg; I\u2019ve, somewhat ill-advisedly, been taking an extended break from\nthe site, but I miss writing here, as well!\n\nReply\n\n  3. rachel says:\n\nJune 28, 2022 at 6:25 am\n\nI too have missed your meditations. This was a particularly poetic one.\nThanks.\n\nReply\n\n    1. Geoff Manaugh says:\n\nAugust 10, 2022 at 11:18 am\n\nThanks, Rachel.\n\nReply\n\n  4. Renato says:\n\nAugust 2, 2022 at 10:31 pm\n\nYour blog has been inspiring to me for years now, thanks\n\nReply\n\n  5. GlenH says:\n\nNovember 6, 2022 at 3:31 am\n\nMissed this one! The strange triple exposure feeling was still there in late\n2001 even when Potsdam Platz was mostly complete.\n\nReply\n\n## Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
