As an epimer of\nfructose, it has been steadily gaining popularity within the last few years,\nand not without good reason! Allulose is not only nearly calorie-free, but\nalso decreases blood glucose levels with meals, and seems to have a wide range\nof potentially beneficial effects.This post is a short summary of why allulose\nis so appealing over sugar and other sugar substitutes.\n\n70% as sweet; 100% as white and crystalline\n\n## Overview of Allulose\n\nAllulose is found naturally in wheat, figs, raisins, maple syrup, and\nmolasses, although in relatively trace amounts. It has around 10% the calories\nof traditional sucrose and can be manufactured from fructose. It\u2019s around 70%\nas sweet as sucrose (regular sugar), but has a similar taste and feel, which\nis a large factor behind why it makes a great substitute (or partial\nsubstitute) for baking or dissolving into things. The taste of Allulose has a\nmore natural and relaxing quality than some other sugar-replacement options\nsuch as xylitol and erythritol, which are both sugar alcohols, but generally\nhave a \u2018cooling effect\u2019 (often likened to the aftertaste of consuming mint,\nwhich allulose conveniently lacks).\n\nAllulose is also an actual sugar (not a sugar alcohol or other compound), and\nhas similar browning properties to sucrose via the Maillard reaction. One\ndownside to mention is that it does seem challenging to keep some styles of\nbaked goods crunchy with allulose as the only sugar; while it definitely seems\nto be one of the best options for sweetening drinks, yogurts, ice creams,\ncakes, and so on, it may not be the best option for super-crunchy cookies\n(although can make great softer ones!). This seems to be due to allulose not\ncrystallizing when it cools, its ability to hold more moisture, and that it is\nmore soluble in liquids than sucrose; hence it being a great fit for drinks,\nsauces, and spongy baked goods.\n\nAllulose was designated as GRAS by the FDA in 2019, so is still relatively new\nto the market compared to many other sugar substitutes, although has been\ngaining significant popularity for the short period that it has been available\nfor general usage in foods. I\u2019m sometimes now able to find allulose for sale\nin a supermarket or included in a sweet good (and it is also now being used in\nproducts such as Soylent), although its usage is still a small fraction to\nthat of sugar and corn syrups. It can easily be purchased on Amazon for around\n$10 per lb (regular sugar is generally closer to $1-2 per lb, so it is quite a\nbit more expensive if you happen to use very large amounts of sugar).\n\n## What Sets Allulose Apart\n\nWhy might we want alternative sources of sweetness from sucrose to begin with?\nAlthough much has been said about the ways sugars are (in some cases)\npotentially harmful, it seems reasonable to posit that there are two qualities\nof a diet with high sugar content (remember, this means any typical western\ndiet!) that are undesirable: firstly, the high caloric content of sugar, which\nmakes over-eating significantly easier and therefore contributes to obesity,\nand secondly, the effects of sucrose on blood glucose levels and thus insulin\nresistance, which contributes to diabetes and metabolic syndrome.\n\nAs we would hope from an alternative to sucrose, allulose doesn\u2019t cause an\nincrease in blood sugar. The reason for this is that it is not absorbed and\ndigested by the gastrointestinal tract, but rather processed by intestinal\nbacteria. For the most part this is a good thing, and is what enables allulose\nto both be low-calorie and to not be converted to glucose in the blood stream.\nThe downside of this is that for some people, especially if consumed in large\nenough quantities, it can cause mildly discomforting side effects such as\nflatulence, subpar digestion, and abdominal discomfort. This is much more\nlikely to occur if you, for example, eat an entire batch of allulose cookies\nby yourself (who would do such a thing..!?), rather than simply use it to\nsweeten a drink or a snack. While I haven\u2019t experienced anything negative\nmyself, everyone is certainly very different when it comes to food.\n\nBut, it gets much better than this! Allulose not only doesn\u2019t increase your\nblood sugar, but actually decreases it! It does this by inhibiting alpha-\nglucosidase (along with several other similar enzymes), which is an enzyme\nthat breaks down starches and disaccharides into glucose (i.e. causes\ncarbohydrates to lead to blood glucose spikes). Other well-known inhibitors of\nalpha-glucosidase include acarbose, a popular and simple diabetic drug which\nsignificantly extends lifespan in mice and has the exact same potential side\neffect profile as large allulose doses (and in my opinion is probably very\ngood for most people to be taking, perhaps extending human lifespan via the\nsame mechanism of action as in mice), and sweet potatoes (source, another\nsource). Thus, adding allulose to meals that contain carbohydrates will result\nin less of a blood glucose spike than if allulose had been excluded.\n\nComparison of blood glucose area under curve for small quantities of fructose\nvs allulose (source: figure 1)\n\nThere\u2019s now quite a few studies showing this in humans (and dogs and mice!),\nwith allulose consistently attenuating the postprandial glucose levels both in\ndiabetic and regular adults (effect sizes are often larger in pre-diabetic and\ndiabetic individuals, as is often the case here).\n\nAllulose blood glucose and insulin areas under the curve in comparisons with\nother sugars (source: figure 2)\n\n## But wait, there\u2019s more!\n\nSeveral studies also appear to show lower plasma triglyceride levels and\nimproved lipid profiles (perhaps via the lowering of hepatic lipogenic enzyme\nactivity, maybe involving SCARB1, but probably many others as well), decreased\nfeeding (perhaps via agonizing glucagon-like peptide-1), enhanced fat\noxidation, and a reduction in inflammation related to adipokine and cytokine\nplasma levels (one paper claims this is partially due to down-regulating\ngm12250 in mice, but if this applies to humans it may be a side-effect of more\nupstream metabolic changes more so than specific agonism/antagonism, although\nas is the case with most foods, things get absurdly complicated very quickly\nwith the amount of pathways involved).\n\nAllulose resulting in reduced feeding in high-fat diet obese and diabetic mice\n(source: figure 3)\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that several of the above studies (particularly ones that\nattempt to hone in on specific mechanisms of action) are in mice, and in fact,\nwe could go much further if we want to look at mice; it\u2019s trivial to find many\nmore potentially favorable results such as \u201cNot only metformin, but also\nD-allulose, alleviates metabolic disturbance and cognitive decline in\nprediabetic rats\u201d or \u201cD-allulose provides cardioprotective effect by\nattenuating cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction in obesity-induced insulin-\nresistant rats\u201c. Although there is less (and sometimes conflicting) evidence\nfor e.g. improved lipid profiles in humans, there is certainly more than\nsufficient evidence of allulose\u2019s effect on reducing blood glucose levels and\noverall calories consumed, from which we would naturally expect many other\nbeneficial effects to follow. Searching for allulose on pubmed results in a\nwonderful selection of studies showing very consistent outcomes in this area,\nand it thus seems plausible that, at the very least, we would see significant\nreductions in diabetes and obesity if allulose were to be more widely adopted\nin consumer food products.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn general it seems like replacing sugar with allulose will result in fewer\ncalories consumed, a lower risk of obesity, lower blood glucose (average and\narea under the curve, sometimes peak) levels and thus improved insulin\nresistance and a lower risk of diabetes and metabolic syndrome, and\npotentially some other beneficial effects (which may or may not apply in\nhumans, but if allulose improves your diet and lowers your food intake, I\nwould not be surprised to see improved lipid profiles and a reduction in\ninflammation, even if entirely for indirect reasons, e.g. cooking at home with\nallulose instead of purchasing processed foods from the store. It\u2019s also worth\nnoting that while some of these benefits are a direct result of allulose\nconsumption, many are also partially from a reduced intake of sugar and\ncalories \u2013 similar to how cutting down on your sugar intake would offer many\nbenefits).\n\nIt\u2019s quite possible that if a notable fraction of other sugars in our diet\nwere to be replaced with allulose, the amount we would gain both in QALYs and\ndollars saved via the resulting reduced healthcare burden would be extremely\nfavorable. Allulose is still relatively new to the market, and as it is also\nmuch more expensive than sugar or corn syrups, its future market penetration\nmay be relatively limited by consumer preferences. Regardless of its presence\nin our broader food ecosystem, you can start experimenting with it yourself\ntoday! (Amazon search results page link, in case this saves you 10 seconds)\n\nI usually use allulose to sweeten drinks, greek yogurt, and sometimes add it\nto sauces or baked goods in small quantities. I\u2019m also pretty interested in\nglycine and think it may be something that most of us should be having a lot\nmore of as well (some notes on this in the glycine section on my supplements\npage), but consider it outside the scope of this article for now. Lastly, if\nthe idea of significantly reducing the glycemic index of your meals is\nappealing, I strongly suggest looking into acarbose \u2013 it is a much stronger\ninhibitor of alpha-glucosidase, well-tolerated, and also relatively cheap.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article you might also enjoy my supplements page which\ndiscusses many other ingredients and drugs that I find interesting with\nrespect to longevity.
