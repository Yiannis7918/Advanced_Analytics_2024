Their flagship app, OKR for Jira, has earned the trust of 1000+\ncompanies across 80 countries.\n\n### The Process\n\nThe client initially outlined a set of front-end requirements for the project.\nThe collaboration process started with just one developer. After a month of\nactive development, the scope expanded to include backend development, and our\nteam had grown to five.\n\nWe closely collaborated with the Digital Toucan team, ensuring our developers\nwere directly accessible and overseeing the entire project management.\n\nAdhering to Scrum best practices, we managed the project through a well-\norganized backlog, two-week sprint cycles, daily stand-ups, sprint reviews,\nretrospectives, and detailed release planning. By utilizing epics and user\nstories, we clearly defined tasks, ensuring all team members maintained focus\nand had a clear vision of the desired outcome. Jira and Confluence were our\nprimary sources of truth for project tracking and documentation. Slack was our\ngo-to for internal communication, while Google Workspace supported our meeting\nand email needs. Additionally, the client used Bitbucket to store and provide\ncode feedback.\n\nVarbintech is committed to our project. They make us feel like they're a part\nof our team and that our business results are important to them.\n\nFilip Rogaczewski\n\nProduct Director & Co-Founder at Digital Toucan\n\n### The Problem\n\nThe client discovered a new business opportunity via their different product,\nand an experienced front-end team was needed to assist in developing the new\nproduct.\n\nThe goal was to build the new application from the ground up while using the\nexisting one as a reference point. After reviewing the current solution, we\nidentified significant opportunities for improvement across various aspects.\nWe prepared a detailed report outlining these findings and shared it with the\nclient. Based on this report, we agreed not just to replicate the existing\nsolution for the new Jira version but also to invest in code quality tools,\ncode review practices, CI/CD automatization, and architecture.\n\nThe client's expectations for the team were to:\n\n  * Develop front-end and back-end features as outlined in Jira ticket descriptions\n\n  * Manage project maintenance, including team coordination\n\n  * Enhance code quality, implement best practices, and address critical issues\n\n### The Solution\n\n#### Clear Communication\n\nOur top priorities for building a sustainable base were transparent\ncommunication, efficient project management, and cultural awareness. We agreed\non communication methods, including messaging, video calls, and project\nmanagement tools, which helped to ensure everyone stayed connected and\ninformed. Beyond the regular daily stand-ups and weekly team meetings, we\nadvocated for direct dialogues with the product owner, actively seeking and\nproviding feedback. This strategy enabled us to tackle any potential issues or\nconcerns proactively.\n\n#### Testing Environment\n\nThe development of an add-on for Jira's on-premise version required\nconsideration of nearly 20+ different Jira versions potentially used by end-\nusers. Manually testing across all these versions was impractical in terms of\ntime and budget. By collaborating closely with the in-house team, we rolled\nout the initial version of our testing environment within three weeks. This\npivotal move drastically reduced time and budget and allowed us to concentrate\non tasks critical to business operations. Moreover, we crafted scripts to\nautomate specific tasks, including generating mock data and further\nstreamlining the development process.\n\n#### Maintainability and Extensibility\n\nThe original cloud-based version was built using outdated React methods. For\nthe new app, the client's team aimed for us to employ the latest React\ntechniques and practices to enhance maintainability and extensibility\nsignificantly. Unlike the previous version, we adopted a component-based\narchitecture, minimizing outdated practices. This approach not only maintained\nthe core features of the original app but also ensured the new version was\nbuilt on a solid, future-proof foundation.\n\n### Achievements\n\nOur team delivered the app's first version in less than three months. The\nclient has significantly benefited from enhanced customer satisfaction, driven\nby superior product performance and a minimal bug rate. We helped Digital\nToucan provide its customers with a top-notch experience without hassle.\n\nWe split the majority of the application into reusable pieces, using smart and\ndumb components. This step also allowed us to migrate the old version of the\napp to the newest codebase while developing new features.\n\nThe essential part of our partnership was not only the new application version\nbut also the smooth and predictable development environment. As a result, we\nsignificantly improved the time to delivery, minimized the number of issues\nand bugs, and simplified the testing process.\n\nAdditional outcomes:\n\n  * Transparent development process with no additional costs\n\n  * 100 end-to-end tests covering 20+ versions of Jira\n\n  * 60% reduction in code duplication\n\n  * The set of reusable components ready to use in both applications\n\n###### Don't miss your chance:\n\nBook a call\n\n### contact@varbintech.com\n\nTake the next step towards achieving your goals by leveraging our top-notch\nexperience with a proven record\n\nWe help startups and companies of all shapes and sizes to build high-quality\nFront-End solutions.\n\n#### Navigation\n\n  * Case studies\n  * Services\n  * Pricing\n\n#### Services\n\n  * Front-end development\n\n  * Source code audit\n\n  * Dedicated front-end team\n\n  * MVP development\n\n  * Team management\n\n#### Hire Engineers\n\n  * Hire React.js Developer\n\n  * Hire Front-End Developer\n\n  * Hire Angular Developer\n\n  * Hire Software Development Team\n\n##### \u00a9 Varbintech 2024\n\n##### Cookie Use\n\nThis site uses cookies from Google to deliver its services and to analyze\ntraffic.\n\nFAQ cookies\n\n", "frontpage": false}
