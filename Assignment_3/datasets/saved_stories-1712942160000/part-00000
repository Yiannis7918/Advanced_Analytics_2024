Who had it? And could it be recovered before it was too late?\n\nSian Cain\n\nShare\n\nThirty years ago, a humble silver bus was transformed into a cinematic icon\nwhen the low-budget Australian film The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the\nDesert became a heart-warming, Oscar-winning smash hit.\n\nBut for years, no one has known where the bus used in Stephan Elliott\u2019s film\nwent. Not long after the 38-day shoot finished in 1993, it seemingly vanished\nwithout a trace. This did not stop countless Australians from claiming they\neither owned it or knew who owned it, or that they had spotted it somewhere up\nand down the country.\n\nThe story of where she ended up, and how she was found, is worthy of a film in\nitself.\n\n## \u2018We were a bit suspicious at first\u2019\n\nIn the 1994 film, Priscilla is home to drag queens Mitzi Del Bra (Hugo\nWeaving), Felicia Jollygoodfellow (Guy Pearce) and transgender woman\nBernadette Bassenger (Terence Stamp) as they drive from Sydney to Alice\nSprings.\n\nIn reality, Priscilla is a 1976 Japanese model Hino RC320. It was owned by\nSydney company Boronia Tours before it was sold to a couple who leased the bus\nto Latent Images, the film\u2019s production company, for the duration of the shoot\nin September and October 1993. Afterwards, the couple hired it out\noccasionally, including to the Australian band the Whitlams, who used it as a\ntour bus for six months in 1994.\n\nBut after that, Priscilla vanished without a trace.\n\nThe Adventures of Priscilla \u2013 five things you didn\u2019t know about the Aussie hit\n\nRead more\n\nFor years, the bus was the white whale for curatorial staff at the History\nTrust of South Australia, who hoped to acquire it for the National Motor\nMuseum in Birdwood, SA \u2013 home to several famous cars from cinema, including\nthe Mad Max Bigfoot buggy.\n\nSo when a man called Michael Mahon got in touch with the History Trust in 2019\nclaiming Priscilla was sitting on his property in Ewingar, New South Wales\n(population: 67), no one really believed him.\n\n\u201cMichael sent a message saying he had the bus and wanted to sell it. I felt\nlike I was in The Castle \u2013 I said, \u2018tell him he\u2019s dreaming\u2019,\u201d says Paul Rees,\nhead of museums at the History Trust and former director of the National Motor\nMuseum. \u201cWe were a bit suspicious at first, to be honest. But we put our\nSherlock Holmes hats on and soon realised it wasn\u2019t a joke, so we started our\ninvestigation.\u201d\n\nThe bus at Ewingar, in the NSW northern rivers. Photograph: History Trust of\nSouth Australia\n\nCurators spent months determining if the bus was truly Priscilla. \u201cA few\nthings really made us confident: it had the right number plates, the\ndistinctive animal print curtains and dashboard cover, and the original name\nroller,\u201d says Adam Paterson, manager curatorial at the History Trust.\n\nComplicating matters were the many pretenders to the throne: there are many\ncopies of Priscilla, including the bus that was driven around the 2000\nOlympics closing ceremony in Sydney; another was made for the talent show I\nWill Survive; and the one used in the Priscilla stage show, now displayed in\nBroken Hill.\n\nIn the film, the bus is famously painted bright pink partway through \u2013 but\nbecause the film-makers could only afford one bus, they painted just half of\nit pink and left the other side silver so they could shoot out of sequence.\nCrucially, some old pink paint hadn\u2019t been removed from a hinge.\n\n\u201cWhat convinced everyone in the end was the pink paint scrapings,\u201d says Rees.\n\u201cCurators are fantastically conservative - they will not jump until they\u2019re\nabsolutely sure. But I was jumping all over the place.\u201d\n\nSome facts and dates remain a little murky, but what everyone agrees on is\nthis: the couple who owned Priscilla eventually broke up and one of them got\nthe bus in the separation. That person drove it to their new partner\u2019s place\nin Ewingar sometime around 2006, where it was eventually abandoned when that\nrelationship ended. When the owner of that house in Ewingar died, it was sold\n\u2013 complete with Priscilla \u2013 to Mahon in 2016.\n\n> The fire went right alongside Priscilla and took out a van, a boat and two\n> cars right next to it\n\nMichael Mahon\n\n\u201cI\u2019d been here in Ewingar for about six months when I went down to the\ncommunity hall to say hello to everybody, and they said, \u2018G\u2019day! What are you\ngoing to do with the bus?\u2019\u201d says Mahon. \u201cI said to the bloke behind the bar,\n\u2018Why is everyone asking me about the bus?\u2019 and he went, \u2018That\u2019s Priscilla!\u2019\n\u2018Strewth,\u2019 I said.\u201d\n\nMahon did some research online and rewatched the film, then looked over the\nbus with fresh eyes. Everything matched, down to the number plates. He went on\nFacebook for advice on bus restoration, but \u201ceveryone thought I was an idiot\nand a liar because they thought she had been stolen or destroyed\u201d.\n\nGavin McOwan follows the route of Priscilla Queen of the Desert to Alice\nSprings\n\nRead more\n\nEventually he made friends with a few enthusiasts, who told him the rusting\nvehicle outside his house was known by two names in the bus-loving community.\n\u201cOne was \u2018The Hunt for Red October\u2019 because they\u2019d been looking for it for\nyears,\u201d says Mahon. \u201cThe other was \u2018the Holy Grail\u2019.\u201d\n\nBy that time, the bus had been languishing outdoors for a decade. In the years\nfollowing, it survived multiple bushfires and floods. In October 2019, when\nhuge flames came within centimetres of the bus, a water bomb struck it and\nsaved it.\n\nMichael Mahon\u2019s property at Ewingar in October 2019, after bushfires passed\nthrough and narrowly avoided destroying Priscilla. Photograph: Michael Mahon\n\n\u201cThe fire went right alongside Priscilla and took out a van, a boat and two\ncars right next to it,\u201d Mahon says. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe it. It was\n2,000-degree temperatures. The fire went straight over the roof of the house,\nthe fireball was 50 feet above the treetop. But Priscilla survived.\u201d\n\nRight after the 2019 fires came floods, which made finding a new home for\nPriscilla even more urgent. \u201cWith all the rain, it started to really rust\nbecause it copped a lot of heat,\u201d says Mahon. \u201cThankfully, the museum was in\nthe same frame of mind as me \u2013 it is a true blue, ridgy-didge Australian icon.\nIt\u2019s got to be saved.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard it so many times \u2013 \u2018I\u2019ve got the bus!\u2019 \u2013 that it gets boring,\u201d\nsays Stephan Elliott, the director and writer of The Adventures of Priscilla,\nQueen of the Desert. When the History Trust got in touch to see if he could\nhelp verify the bus\u2019s authenticity, he was sceptical.\n\n\u201cBut I was astonished when they showed me the photos,\u201d he says. \u201cI said,\n\u2018There\u2019s two things I need to see: the carpet and if there is a side-railing\non the roof.\u2019 They sent more photos and I immediately said, \u2018That\u2019s it. You\ngot her.\u2019 My jaw was just on the ground.\u201d\n\nPriscilla in a scene from the film. Photograph: Film Fin/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nThe side-railing was installed on the bus\u2019s interior so a camera could be hung\nfrom it \u201clike a little cable car\u201d, to allow for moving shots inside the bus\nwhile it was on the road. \u201cIt\u2019s so odd, no one else would think to put it\nthere,\u201d says Elliott.\n\nThe director, who fondly calls Priscilla \u201cthe old bus and chain\u201d, wrote the\nfilm at the same time as his 1993 comedy Frauds, which ended up being made\nfirst. The experience was \u201cterrible, the whole Hollywood nightmare ... I was\ncompletely ruined by the end, I was literally a dribbling wreck.\u201d\n\nThe Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert review \u2013 riotous return trip\n\nRead more\n\n\u201cWe were having an early production meeting for Priscilla and I said, \u2018I can\u2019t\ndo this. I don\u2019t want to ever make a film again.\u2019 Everyone was shocked. But\nOwen [Paterson, the production designer] said, \u2018Well, there\u2019s something that\nI\u2019ve found and it\u2019s about to pull up. Come and have a look.\u2019\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re sitting there in Paddington and around the corner she came. It was a\nvery weird moment where I got inside the bus and I put my hand on the wall. I\nturned to everyone and said, \u2018I think I can do this.\u2019\u201d\n\nElliott estimates he has seen 50 different copies of the bus over the years,\n\u201cat premieres, Mardi Gras and daggy things\u201d. \u201cSo to hear that the original was\nstill alive, it was very special,\u201d he adds. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how it is. It\nis just extraordinary.\u201d\n\nGiven the complex nature of who actually owned Priscilla, having been\nabandoned on a deceased estate, the History Trust applied to the NSW courts to\nbuy the vehicle as abandoned property in 2021, 18 months after Mahon first\ncontacted them. This process required them to wait another whole year for\nsomeone to come forward to claim it as their own. But no one did.\n\nMahon was finally deemed the legal owner of the bus and sold it to the History\nTrust in May 2023. In September, \u201ca whole army of very experienced mechanics\nand engineers\u201d turned up to Ewingar to move her for the first time in at least\n16 years.\n\n\u201cI was actually on leave but I drove myself all the way to NSW to watch it be\nmoved \u2013 this is what a project like this does to you,\u201d says Rees.\n\nThe Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert: rewatching classic\nAustralian films\n\nRead more\n\nThe bus\u2019s flat tyres were carefully filled with air; if they couldn\u2019t be\nfilled or burst, it would become a much more complex operation. Everyone held\ntheir breath as the bus was wriggled \u201cinch by inch\u201d out of a tight spot on a\nslope, then down the hill on to a truck. Just as it went on, one tyre popped.\n\nTen or so Ewingar locals gathered to watch her go. (\u201cWord started to spread\nand as the bus drove out, they all sort of waved goodbye,\u201d says Paterson.\n\u201cThat was pretty cool.\u201d)\n\nWas Mahon sad to see Priscilla go? \u201cYes and no,\u201d he says. \u201cI believe museums\nare important, so it was going to the right place.\u201d But long after she was\ntaken, he felt a pang when he looked over the spot, \u201clike something was\nmissing\u201d.\n\n\u201cPart of me was gone,\u201d Mahon says. \u201cBut if it stayed where it was for another\n12 months, it probably would have been unrepairable.\u201d\n\nPriscilla is now at a restoration business in Queensland, ready to be glammed\nup \u2013 but not too much.\n\nThe bus at the restoration company in Brisbane, Queensland. Photograph:\nHistory Trust of South Australia\n\n\u201cWe are restoring it to the state it was in during the making of Priscilla\nbecause the film is why it is significant,\u201d says Rees. \u201cSo if the crew say it\nwas a bit manky then, then it\u2019s going to be that way when we\u2019re done with it.\u201d\n\nBut Priscilla was almost 20 years old when she featured in the film and will\nturn 50 in two years\u2019 time, so she needs a lot of work. The History Trust is\nhoping people around the world will help raise A$2.2m (US$1.4m/\u00a31.1m) \u2013 a\ntotal that includes A$750,000 for an extensive restoration, including possibly\nmaking the bus roadworthy again. The rest will go to building an ambitious\n\u201cimmersive\u201d exhibit, fit for a queen, in the National Motor Museum in South\nAustralia. (The SA government has already committed $100,000.)\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not in good shape, she\u2019s not been loved and cared for. But she\u2019s very,\nvery salvageable \u2013 if you\u2019ve got money to throw at it,\u201d says Rees. \u201cWe want\nthe exhibition to be fabulous. If we\u2019re taking her on the road to Mardi Gras,\nwe want that to be a fabulous experience. All those things cost a lot of\nmoney, as do the decades of care we will provide her with.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s survived flood, fires, 16 years out in the open,\u201d he adds. \u201cBut the film\nis all about survival \u2013 and somehow, the bus survived.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Film\n  * Drag\n  * Australian film\n  * Adelaide\n  * South Australia\n  * New South Wales\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Comments (...)\n\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Books\n  * Music\n  * TV & radio\n  * Art & design\n  * Film\n  * Games\n  * Classical\n  * Stage\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
