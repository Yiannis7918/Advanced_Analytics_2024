Throughout most of human history, we could only talk to other neurons\nclose to us via 'synapses' of a spoken language.\n\nWith the invention of writing, we discovered the possibility to connect all of\nthese neurons. Our speed of communication was slow and the messages we\ntransmitted were few. Sometimes, it took centuries for some transformative\nideas like Arabic numerals or heliocentrism to travel across the globe. Still,\nwe solitary neurons became globally connected for the first time.\n\nWith the invention of the telegraph, telephone, radio and television, the\nspeed and quality of our connections improved vastly. Our shared network\nbecame stronger and more diverse in its messages.\n\n## The Internet as our superpower\n\nThen came the Internet - the quintessence of interconnectedness. More than any\nother time in human history, most of us are connected to the nervous system of\nhumanity.\n\nMany of us spend most of our waking hours on the Internet. We can broadcast\nwhat we think and feel, communicate with other neurons, and co-create\nintricate webs of cooperation. We can think of this digital nervous system as\nour collective superpower.\n\n### The internet is built as a great foundation for this nervous system. It is\ndecentralized by design - no single party controls it.\n\n## The cloud and its limitations\n\n0:00\n\n/0:15\n\nCloud-based architecture: where application developers are the keepers of our\nkeys\n\nThe problem is that the modern Internet relies strongly on cloud technologies,\nwhere client applications communicate with each other only via servers. It is\nakin to having a server between any two neurons in the nervous system, or each\nneuron being inside a box that decides if the signal from this neuron can go\nthrough.\n\nIn cloud architecture, application developers store keys of the accounts of\nusers on their behalf, so they are the keepers of keys. It means that these\napplications now hold the power to voice down some and promote others, to\nblock and to recommend, to decide which information is shared and distributed\non the Internet. Software companies can block people based on their geographic\nlocation, based on random algorithms, personal beliefs of their founders or\nshareholders, and the political agenda of powerful groups they are close to.\n\nIn some sense, we now have even different parts of these nervous systems\nloosely connected. The Western internet. The Chinese internet. The Russian\ninternet. The Iranian internet. And so on. They look different, but underneath\nthere is the same structure of power - different elites with different agendas\ncontrol how neurons talk, what information they see and if they can\ncommunicate at all.\n\nThis separateness is not the biggest problem; what is more dangerous is that\nin each of these versions of the Internet, the neurons can\u2019t talk and express\nthemselves directly to each other. Servers control our communication with\nthose closest to us: family members, neighbors and local communities.\n\nThe problems with cloud-based architecture don't stop there. Not only do\ncentral servers control who can do what, but their control is ubiquitous. Even\nwhen texting your family member on the couch next to you, the signal from your\ndevice to theirs needs to go to the application server first, and only after\nthat, return to your own living room.\n\n### If that center fails or does not respond, it means that even nearby\nneurons cannot communicate digitally. For a biological organism, an\nunresponsive nervous system would mean an instant death. The nervous system of\nhumanity needs an upgrade.\n\n## A no-one in between nervous system\n\n0:00\n\n/0:15\n\nAnytype: A no-one in-between network\n\nThere are parts of the Internet where server-first architecture is more\nefficient - massive online games, uber-like networks and other examples. For\nthe role the communication layer plays, we can use a better approach than the\ncloud.\n\nIf we are to design a nervous system that's resilient and agile, it needs a\ndifferent wiring - when neurons connect to each other directly. For this we\nneed to give the keys to neurons and wire them differently - on local first\nprinciples. This wiring we call a \u201cno-one in between\u201d communication system.\n\n### A no-one in between wiring is a better foundation for families,\ncommunities and associations of creators.\n\n## How to implement. Technological foundation.\n\nTwo pieces of technology look striking, especially if we imagine their\ncombined power. These technologies come under the obscure names of Public Key\nCryptography and CRDTs.\n\nPublic key cryptography can protect digital data in a way that is not possible\nin the world of atoms. Imagine each of us having a vault that no one in the\nwhole world can break into. Not a malicious hacker, not a powerful state, not\neven if they combined forces. This is not possible in the world of atoms.\n\nBy using public key cryptography, we can generate your very own vault where\nyour data and messages live, and which has two keys: private and public.\nKnowing your public key, anyone can send encrypted messages but only you - the\nholder of the private key - can open the vault and see what's inside. All of\nthe computational resources on Earth are not enough to decrypt a single\nmessage. Generating such keys does not cost any money and can be done on any\ncomputer, without the need to connect to the internet. Vault creation and\nauthorization can be fully independent from anyone. It means each neuron can\nbe digitally independent.\n\n### Once we have our independent vaults from which we control the keys, we can\nalso enable vaults to talk to each other on local-first principles. This is\nwhere CRDTs come in.\n\nIn traditional cloud architecture (also known as client-server), all clients\nneed to connect to a server where the master record is kept. This server\nresolves potential conflicts when clients are working on the same information,\nespecially in real time.\n\nIf we want to change the wiring to local first, we need a way to resolve\nconflicts independently by all clients, so that the client is not dependent on\na server for this. This is not easy as we cannot control which devices are\nonline, which are offline.\n\nFortunately, there is a new piece of technology called CRDTs (conflict-free\nreplicated data types) that allow reaching the same state irrespective of the\norder in which changes are received, so each device can resolve conflicts\nindependently - without relying on a single master copy.\n\nPublic key cryptography has been implemented widely. So far mostly in crypto\nwallets. CRDTs on the other hand is a fresh approach that emerged in computer\nscience in 2011 and has mostly been implemented in experiments and research.\n\n## The implementation\n\nThat\u2019s why our team at Anytype has been working on combining both approaches\ninto a new local first protocol based on creators\u2019 keys. It is called AnySync\nand it supports hi-performant and scalable synchronization of objects,\ndiscussions, communities and apps that do not depend on a cloud. You can read\nmore about our sync protocol here.\n\nAnytype is an interface to vaults, described in this article - encrypted,\nlocal first and with keys controlled by creators. This means in Anytype\nthere's nobody standing between you and your vault, you and your contacts, or\nyour devices and each other, and that these vaults talk to each other on\nlocal-first principles.\n\nanytype \u2014 the everything app\n\nfor those who celebrate trust & autonomy.\n\n## The future\n\nApplying it to the design of the web we aim to create a system where we can do\neverything offline and in local networks and the connection to the internet is\noptional. This will help the neuronal groups be more resilient and fast. We\ninvite others to join as co-creators to build a local first version of the\nInternet together.\n\n### The future will be the one you build.\n\nSources\n\n  1. Marshall McLuhan.
