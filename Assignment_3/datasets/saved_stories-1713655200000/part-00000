Amendments to expand\nprivacy safeguards failed.\n\nCongress renewed Section 702 at the last minute.Chip Somodevilla / Getty\nImages\n\nApril 20, 2024, 4:43 AM UTC / Updated April 20, 2024, 3:33 PM UTC\n\nBy Frank Thorp V, Sahil Kapur and Ryan Nobles\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate voted to reauthorize a powerful surveillance tool the\nU.S. government describes as critical to combating terrorism, after defeating\nefforts by civil liberties advocates on the left and right to rein it in.\n\nThe vote of 60-34 sends the bill to President Joe Biden, who has championed\nit. The legislation extends Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence\nSurveillance Act, or FISA, for two more years.\n\nThe final vote came after the Senate defeated six amendments from progressive\nand conservative senators who said the spying powers are too broad and\ndemanded protections for Americans\u2019 civil liberties and privacy. The Biden\nadministration and FISA supporters had warned that even a brief lapse could\nhave a detrimental impact on the intelligence-gathering process.\n\nSenators just missed the midnight deadline to reauthorize the FISA Section 702\nstatute but voted to reauthorize it minutes later. Had any amendments been\nadopted, the bill would have been sent back to the House, potentially forcing\na lengthy lapse of the law.\n\n\u201cIn the nick of time, bipartisanship has prevailed here in the Senate,\u201d Senate\nMajority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy, people had many different views, but we all know one thing:\nletting FISA expire would have been dangerous. It\u2019s an important part of our\nnational security to stop acts of terror, drug trafficking, and violent\nextremism,\u201d Schumer said on the Senate floor. \u201cThank you to all my Senate\ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle for their good work in getting this\ndone.\u201d\n\nThe House passed a two-year FISA renewal last week after defeating, by the\nslimmest of margins, an amendment to require a warrant to search through the\ncommunications of Americans as part of data collected while surveilling\nforeigners. Senators delayed a vote for days by pushing for amendments to make\nchanges to the bill.\n\nThe bill\u2019s passage came on the heels of a pitched battle between the U.S.\nintelligence community and an unusual coalition of progressive and\nconservative civil liberties advocates, who argued that the powers are too\nexpansive and impinge on the privacy of Americans.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that people understand how sweeping this bill is,\u201d said Sen.\nRon Wyden, D-Ore., a member of the Intelligence Committee and outspoken\nproponent of privacy protections. \u201cSomething was inserted at the last minute,\nwhich would basically compel somebody like a cable guy to spy for the\ngovernment. They would force the person to do it and there would be no\nappeal.\u201d\n\n### Recommended\n\nWar in Ukraine\n\n### War in UkraineHouse passes critical aid to Ukraine and Taiwan along with a\nTikTok ban\n\nTrump trials\n\n### Trump trialsFrom stare-downs to shut-eye: Trump\u2019s every move in criminal\ntrial under the microscope\n\nIn a rare break with Schumer and Biden, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the\npresident pro tempore, opposed the bill, saying: \u201cI have strong concerns that\nthis expansion of FISA Section 702 authorities would allow for increased abuse\nand misuse of the law \u2014 infringing on the rights of Americans here at home.\u201d\n\nSenate Intelligence Committee Chair Mark Warner, D-Va., pushed back on that\nand other criticisms of a House amendment added to the FISA reauthorization\nbill, arguing that it \u201cis narrowly focused on a significant intelligence gap,\u201d\nbut some members like Wyden worry it could be abused.\n\n\u201cContrary to what some have been saying, it expressly excludes coffee shops,\nbars, restaurants, residences, hotels, libraries, recreational facilities and\na whole litany of similar establishments,\u201d Warner said on the Senate floor\nWednesday. \u201cIt also absolutely would not, as some critics have maintained,\nallow the U.S. government to compel, for example, a janitor working in an\noffice building in Northern Virginia to spy for the intelligence community.\u201d\n\nWarner said that allowing FISA to expire would have put the U.S. in \u201cuncharted\nterritory\u201d as companies who work with the government to provide intelligence\nmight have stopped doing so without a reauthorization.\n\nSen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said that \u201c60% of the president\u2019s daily brief is\ncomposed of 702-derived materials, so this is absolutely critical.\u201d\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland called Section 702 \"indispensable\" in a\nstatement.\n\n\u201cThis reauthorization of Section 702 gives the United States the authority to\ncontinue to collect foreign intelligence information about non-U.S. persons\nlocated outside the United States, while at the same time codifying important\nreforms the Justice Department has adopted to ensure the protection of\nAmericans\u2019 privacy and civil liberties,\" he said.\n\nFrank Thorp V\n\nFrank Thorp V is a producer and off-air reporter covering Congress for NBC\nNews, managing coverage of the Senate.\n\nSahil Kapur\n\nSahil Kapur is a senior national political reporter for NBC News.\n\nRyan Nobles\n\nRyan Nobles is a correspondent covering Capitol Hill.\n\nRebecca Kaplan contributed.\n\n\u00a9 2024 NBC UNIVERSAL\n\nWe and our partners use cookies on this site to improve our service, perform\nanalytics, personalize advertising, measure advertising performance, and\nremember website preferences.
