She had never purchased a home, and as a\nlawyer, I just assumed I knew how the system worked: The buyer has an agent,\nbut the seller pays a commission (typically 6% of the sale price) that's split\nbetween their agent and the buyer's agent. So it's like I get free help to\nguide me through the morass of homebuying.\n\nI quickly learned how foolish I was, and how right she was. Three months\nlater, when I bought my Brooklyn apartment, I ended up being my own agent. In\nthe coming years, with real-estate agents facing pressure from sites like\nZillow and from the National Association of Realtors' agreeing to an industry-\nshifting $418 million price-fixing settlement in March, it's likely that a lot\nmore people will do what I did and represent themselves. That's because\ncommission splitting may soon be a thing of the past.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you're thinking about buying a home, ask yourself the following three\nquestions: Do you have an internet connection? Do you have at least a seventh-\ngrade reading level? Do you like saving money? If you answer yes to all three,\nyou're in fantastic shape to be your own agent.\n\nI wish someone had told me this before my house-hunting journey began.\n\nThe thought of buying a home has always terrified me, but as New York City\nrents were ticking up by the millisecond in a historic housing crisis, I felt\nlike it was now or never.\n\nFor months I searched on my own, first zeroing in on my ideal neighborhood and\nthen fumbling through the harrowing math exercise of deciding just what my\nprice limit was. I even made custom maps on StreetEasy, plotting down to the\nblock where I envisioned my future life.\n\nBut having grown up hearing the NYC apartment market likened to the Hunger\nGames, I had no idea how to actually go from looking to buying, and \u2014 I\nthought at the time \u2014 I desperately needed help. So when a close friend\nvouched for an agent who had represented her in several deals, I was ecstatic.\n\nThen I met my agent, and things began to feel off.\n\nThe best part of having an agent was realizing just how much I had already\nfigured out on my own. He said he'd want to know what my \"requirements\" and\n\"nice to haves\" were, so I made a chart, listing dozens of items. At least 900\nsquare feet: requirement. In-building gym: nice to have. In-unit laundry:\nreally nice to have. Looking at the list and the map, the agent told me what\nI'd known months before meeting him: \"You might need to be more flexible.\"\nStrike one for Captain Obvious.\n\n> \"Do you have an internet connection? Do you have at least a seventh-grade\n> reading level? Do you like saving money? If you answer yes to all three,\n> you're in fantastic shape to be your own agent.\"\n\nBut also: Wasn't an agent there for my pickiness? I knew that what I wanted\nwas at the very outer limit of my budget, especially at a time with record-low\ninventory. But my list of \"must haves\" truly were the things I needed for\nbuying an apartment to make sense. The list was already a small fraction of\nwhat I would have written when I started looking (farewell, pipe dreams of\nriver views and sprawling private decks). And where I looked had already\nexpanded far beyond the spots I ideally wanted. I wasn't asking for the\nimpossible, just something very particular and very hard to find. Wasn't that\nthe whole point of having an agent, someone paid to pluck for you your\npersonal paradise from the endless haystack of units you don't want or can't\nafford?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRather than find this magical listing, however, my agent went into sales mode,\ntrying to explain to me why I should settle for places I had already ruled\nout. He was always very responsive and polite (until he wasn't, more on that\nlater), sending me leads as soon as he saw something promising come on the\nmarket. But with a few exceptions, the \"leads\" my agent \"found\" were always\nthings I'd already seen on StreetEasy, sometimes weeks earlier. Strike two.\n\nIn fairness, all agents have a disadvantage here, because the internet has\ncome to democratize homebuying. For many years, even though sites like\nRealtor.com existed, buyers were at the mercy of agents to know what was for\nsale. This was because, a 2005 antitrust lawsuit from the US Department of\nJustice lays out, Realtors used their control of the listing services to\nstrangle the nascent online housing market and punish agents who listed homes\npublicly. All that ended in 2008, when a massive settlement opened up the\nfloodgates of public listings. These days, most agents largely have the same\nlistings the rest of us do.\n\nSo my agent wasn't going to find me my dream house, and the work of hunting\nwas basically on me. But I still needed his expertise to vet the apartment and\nnegotiate a deal that would surely come with reams of byzantine paperwork.\nDidn't I?\n\nAccording to Stephen Brobeck, a senior fellow at the Consumer Federation of\nAmerica, many of us don't. Homebuying, he says, is \"not rocket science.\" But\nthe real-estate industry has made it hard for many buyers to understand just\nhow little having an agent can help. \"I call it the 'Alice in Wonderland'\nworld, because things are not as they seem. And when you understand them, they\ndon't make much sense.\"\n\nFor me, I finally climbed out of the rabbit hole and woke up when my agent led\nme into a bidding war.\n\nThe apartment was bright, airy, just a few blocks from McCarren Park, and more\nthan 1,200 square feet \u2014 practically a mansion by Williamsburg standards. But\nthere were worrying signs. The unit's bottom floor was below street level, and\nthe block itself was in a flood zone. After touring the unit with the agent, I\nhad a bunch of questions. The inquiries I parroted, most of which I'd learned\nfrom Googling, were pretty straightforward: Any pending or anticipated\nbuilding repairs, assessments, or compliance measures? For example, in New\nYork City, larger buildings need to periodically erect costly scaffolding to\ninspect their facade \u2014 you want to know if that's around the corner. But to\nalmost every due-diligence question I asked, my agent said, \"That's something\nfor the lawyers in diligence.\"\n\nIt turned out that almost all the things that really concerned me \u2014 from the\ncondo association's financial health to the building's historical flood data \u2014\nwere to be investigated after the sale had been negotiated, after my agent had\ndone his part.\n\n> \"I've read tweets from reply guys longer than bidding documents.\"\n\nDespite my concerns, my agent prodded me to go for a bid. He kept telling me\nthat the apartment might sell very quickly, that we had to move soon. So we\nput in a bid. And when I saw it, I was shocked \u2014 not at the amount, but at the\ndocument. The whole thing was maybe a third of a page, summarizing the\napartment's location, the amount of the offer, and a few other easy-to-\nunderstand details (like cash offer or mortgage). I was expecting something\nmassive, confusing, and formal, but, again, it turned out that was for later,\nsomething for a lawyer to review, not the agent. I've read tweets from reply\nguys longer than the bidding document.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bid almost worked. It was down to me and one other buyer, someone very\nsimilarly situated and with a similar bid, according to my agent.\n\nThis is when he finally struck out. When I made my bid, I went to the absolute\nmaximum of what I felt comfortable spending, leaving zero wiggle room. But now\nmy agent said that wasn't enough. He knew my finances and kept telling me how\nhe knew I could afford to go higher. \"What's 50k really going to mean to you\nover the lifetime of the apartment?\" But I knew that was $50,000 more than I\nwas willing to spend, $50,000 more than I thought it was worth. Buying a house\ncan make even the largest sums seem negligible if you're not careful. But\n$50,000 is still $50,000. When I held firm, my agent couldn't hide his\nexasperation. He said something about me needing to \"get serious.\" I realized\nhe wanted the deal to go through more than I did. After all, that was the only\nway he got paid.\n\nI lost the bidding war, and a couple months later I was cosmically relieved I\nhad. During record-breaking rains in New York City last fall, the corner with\nthat apartment flooded several feet above street level. I imagined just how\nawful it would have felt to have overextended myself to buy that apartment\nonly to end up financially and literally underwater.\n\nBrobeck described the real-estate industry as \"rife with conflicts of\ninterest,\" including many scenarios far worse than what I faced. Where my\nagent was merely pushy, others have gone on to \"double-dip\" on payments from\nboth buyers and sellers, to drive up the price their client pays to increase\nthe commission, and even share confidential information from one client with\nanother. The National Association of Realtors' own 2015 report says, \"The real\nestate industry is saddled with a large number of part-time, untrained,\nunethical, and/or incompetent agents.\"\n\nI didn't want to pay someone who I felt was working against me, especially\nwhen I didn't see what they were bringing me in return. So I fired the agent\nand had a go on my own. I typed up my own bid form (all of 174 words) and kept\nan eye on StreetEasy, and a few weeks later I toured an open house.\n\nThe price was out of my budget, but the unit had been sitting on the market\nfor a few months. So I came in with a low bid, the sort of tactic my agent had\ndiscouraged. Rather than toss it out, the seller and I negotiated. By the time\nthey said \"best and final,\" the seller had carved six figures off the asking\nprice. Not bad for my first negotiation. Just before closing, while on a\nwalkthrough with the seller's agent, I asked how my representing myself had\naffected things. He was candid: \"Not splitting the commission meant they could\ndo $50,000 lower.\" Like so many sellers, the prior owners had baked my agent's\n3% commission into the selling price, and without it, I could save the\ndifference. $50,000 is $50,000.\n\nThe class-action settlement with the NAR is going to make it a lot harder for\nsellers to be forced to pay for buyers' agents. Going forward, for people like\nme without an agent, a savvy seller may pay just 3% of the sales price to\ntheir own agent instead of 6% to be split with a buyer's agent. Some\nhomebuyers may still want an agent, especially those who don't feel\ncomfortable representing themselves or don't have the time, but faced with the\nprospect of paying directly for agents who offer less and less of an edge, I\nexpect many more people will go their own way, and save tens of thousands of\ndollars in the process. Experts estimate that nationwide, after the NAR\nsettlement, buyers may save up to $30 billion a year.\n\nA few weeks after I moved into my new apartment, I ran into my ex-girlfriend.\nI told her I had bought a place, and she was thrilled for me. Then I\nsheepishly added: \"So, that whole agent thing, turns out you're right. It was\na scam after all.\" She just beamed more broadly.\n\nAlbert Fox Cahn is the founder and executive director of the Surveillance\nTechnology Oversight Project, or STOP, a New York-based civil-rights and\nprivacy group.\n\n#### About Discourse Stories\n\nThrough our Discourse journalism, Business Insider seeks to explore and\nilluminate the day\u2019s most fascinating issues and ideas.
