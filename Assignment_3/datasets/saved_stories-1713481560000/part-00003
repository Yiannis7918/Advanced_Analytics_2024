Product design\nengineers often work with the design system which requires a multidisciplinary\nmindset. Marketing-centric design engineers focus on the marketing website or\npublic facing projects often using advanced CSS and WebGL techniques.\n\nAs a dedicated job board, designengineer.io focuses on sharing roles that are\nexplicitly design engineering and also adjacent (for instance design role\nwhere all the existing designers on the team code).\n\nCON\n\n> Design Engineering is the embodiment of Steve's \u2018Design is how it works.\u2019\n> principle.\n>\n> I believe it's going to be one of the most important roles and\n> differentiators in the next generation of software companies.\u201d\n>\n> Guillermo Rauch\n>\n> CEO Vercel\n\nQUT\n\n## Discourse\n\nThe formalization of \u201cDesign Engineer\u201d as a role is contentious.\n\nLiving on the margins has its benefits. Making, creating, building without any\nformal requirements is what makes the web so much fun.\n\nCorporatizing the playfulness feels like a step back. Having a concrete role\ndefinition places observable edges on a generalist philosophy.\n\nThat said, design engineering (UX engineering, creative development,\nprototyping) work often happens without getting noticed or paid. The title\nisnt perfect, but it helps. It gives young tech creatives a clear career path\nbeyond having to specialize. Plus it paves a way to earn money for the cross-\ndiscipline value the skillset brings.\n\nDIS\n\n## Further Reading\n\n  * Comprehensive analysis of Design Engineer as a term by @david_luhr\n  * Breakdown of Design Engineering at DoorDash by @ryngonzalez\n  * Design Engineering at Vercel\n  * Design Engineering: An emerging role in software by @davidhoang\n\nLIN\n\nDesign\n\nEngineer\n\nIO\n\nJob board for design engineers...cause there isn't one\n\nFOT\n\n\u00a9 Copyright\n\n2024\n\nThis With That\n\nCOP\n\nColophon\n\n### Design\n\n  * Heading\n\nReckless Neue\n\n  * Body\n\nMaison Neue\n\n  * Mono\n\nIBM Plex Mono\n\n  * Icons\n\nStreamline\n\n### Engineer\n\n  * Styling\n\nTailwind\n\n  * Framework\n\nNext.js 14\n\n  * UI\n\nRadix & Sonner\n\n  * DB\n\nSupabase\n\nCOL\n\n", "frontpage": false}
