Credit: CERN\n\nOnce a particle of matter, always a particle of matter. Or not. Thanks to a\nquirk of quantum physics, four known particles made up of two different\nquarks\u2014such as the electrically neutral D meson composed of a charm quark and\nan up antiquark\u2014can spontaneously oscillate into their antimatter partners and\nvice versa.\n\nAt a seminar held March 26 at CERN, the LHCb collaboration at the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC) presented the results of its latest search for\nmatter\u2013antimatter asymmetry in the oscillation of the neutral D meson, which,\nif found, could help shed light on the mysterious matter\u2013antimatter imbalance\nin the universe.\n\nThe weak force of the Standard Model of particle physics induces an asymmetry\nbetween matter and antimatter, known as CP violation, in particles containing\nquarks. However, these sources of CP violation are difficult to study and are\ninsufficient to explain the matter\u2013antimatter imbalance in the universe,\nleading physicists to both search for new sources and to study the known ones\nbetter than ever before.\n\nIn their latest endeavor, the LHCb researchers have rolled up their sleeves to\nmeasure with unprecedented precision a set of parameters that determine the\nmatter\u2013antimatter oscillation of the neutral D meson and enable the search for\nthe hitherto unobserved but predicted CP violation in the oscillation.\n\nThe collaboration had previously measured the same set of parameters, which\nare linked to the decay of the neutral D meson into a positively charged kaon\nand a negatively charged pion, using its full data set from Run 1 of the LHC\nand a partial data set from Run 2.\n\nThis time around, the team analyzed the full Run-2 data set and, by combining\nthe result with that of its previous analysis, excluding the partial Run-2\ndata set, it obtained the most precise measurements of the parameters to\ndate\u2014the overall measurement uncertainty is 1.6 times smaller than the\nsmallest uncertainty achieved before by LHCb.\n\nThe results are consistent with previous studies, confirming the\nmatter\u2013antimatter oscillation of the neutral D meson and showing no evidence\nof CP violation in the oscillation. The findings call for future analyses of\nthis and other decays of the neutral D meson using data from the third run of\nthe LHC and its planned upgrade, the High-Luminosity LHC.\n\nOther neutral D meson decays of interest include the decay into a pair of two\nkaons or two pions, in which LHCb researchers observed CP violation in\nparticles containing charm quarks for the first time, and the decay into a\nneutral kaon and a pair of pions, with which LHCb clocked the speed of the\nparticle's matter\u2013antimatter oscillation. No avenue should be left unexplored\nin the search for clues to the matter\u2013antimatter imbalance in the universe and\nother cosmic mysteries.\n\nProvided by CERN\n\nCitation: Searching for new asymmetry between matter and antimatter (2024,\nApril 12) retrieved 13 April 2024 from\nhttps://phys.org/news/2024-04-asymmetry-antimatter.html\n\nThis document is subject to copyright.
