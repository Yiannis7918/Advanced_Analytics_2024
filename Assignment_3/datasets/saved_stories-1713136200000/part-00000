The emulator is already one of the top free apps\non the App Store charts.\n\nIt was not entirely clear if Apple would allow emulators to work with any\ngames, but iGBA is able to load any Game Boy ROMs that users download from the\nweb and open via the Files app on the iPhone. Accordingly, it seems like there\nare no game restrictions for emulators, unless Apple mistakenly approved iGBA\non the App Store.\n\niGBA works with Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance games. It is\nimportant to note that it can be illegal to possess certain ROMs from game\ndevelopers, but homebrew Game Boy games are typically in the clear.\n\niGBA appears to be a copy of Riley Testut's open-source GBA4iOS emulator, but\nwith ads that can track users. GBA4iOS is the predecessor to Testut's current\nNintendo game emulator Delta, which can be installed on the iPhone outside of\nthe App Store, and will soon be available through his alternative app\nmarketplace AltStore on iPhones in the EU. It is not clear if Testut plans to\nmake Delta available in the App Store following the rule change.\n\nTags: App Store, Emulator\n\n[ 31 comments ]\n\n## Top Rated Comments\n\nZapski\n\n2 hours ago at 08:35 am\n\nSo this is an ad and tracking enabled version of someone else\u2019s work.
