As\nhe left his tent, draped in the Iranian flag and surrounded by flowers, he\nclutched an envelope containing a letter for the king. After carefully\nsmartening himself up, he was wheeled to a taxi by his wife, Mattie Heaven, a\nConservative councillor.\n\nAt the garden party, he managed to shake hands with Camilla, the Queen\nConsort, and hand-deliver his letter to the king\u2019s representative. Heaven had\nreceived the royal invitation before Beheshti launched his hunger strike and\nsaid he was always her plus one and she had not wanted to go on her own.\n\nA gentle but deeply determined man, Beheshti has been camped outside the\nForeign Office in pursuit of his demand that the government proscribe the\nIslamic Revolutionary Guards Corps as a threat to British society. He claims\nthat the IRGC has been responsible for 10 death threats in the past seven\nmonths. Six other Iranians have pitched tents outside the Foreign Office in an\nact of solidarity.\n\nBeheshti said: \u201cIranian dissidents and journalists are persecuted and in\ndanger under the Islamic Republic. They shouldn\u2019t also have to fear for their\nlives in the UK. We have a responsibility to keep them safe from harm,\nparticularly when they are risking everything for freedom.\u201d\n\nThe foreign secretary, James Cleverly, had yet to stop to talk to him once in\nthe past 70 days, Beheshti said. Cleverly told MPs on Tuesday that he was\nconcerned for Beheshti\u2019s health and urged him to stop.\n\nBeheshti said he would only break his strike if he was driven unconscious or\nthe government met his demand, saying his body had grown weaker but his mind\nwas stronger.\n\nHis doctor, who comes to see him regularly to check his blood pressure and\nheart, has told him to stop, saying he is causing himself permanent damage.\nHis diet consists of water, coffee and a handful of sugar cubes.\n\nRichard Ratcliffe, who endured a 20-day hunger strike outside the Foreign\nOffice to secure the release of his wife, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, has said\nhe cannot begin to imagine Beheshti\u2019s state, remembering how his own mind\nslowed substantially.\n\nHeaven worries that ministers are divided over the issue. Beheshti has strong\ncross-party support for his campaign from MPs \u2013 more than 120 have signed a\npetition backing him \u2013 and on Saturday a mood of unity, rare in the Iranian\nopposition, prevailed as 18 speakers attended a rally to back his cause.\n\nBeheshti has met the security minister, Tom Tugendhat, and the Middle East\nminister, Tariq Ahmad, to press his case.\n\nWhile it is the Home Office that proscribes organisations, it is understood\nthat it is the Foreign Office that opposes such a move in this case, fearing\nthe impact it might have on the British diplomatic mission in Tehran.\n\nThe Foreign Office says the IRGC is already under sanctions in its entirety,\nwith many individual IRGC members also having sanctions imposed on them, so\nmaking them subject to travel bans.\n\nHeaven said her husband was not on hunger strike for himself or even for Iran,\nbut for the protection of British values and freedoms. She said Hamas and\nHezbollah were banned in the UK, yet the IRGC was the mother of these\norganisations.\n\nThe Terrorism Act 2000 requires the Home Office to look at five factors when\ndeciding whether to proscribe an organisation: the nature and scale of an\norganisation\u2019s activities, the specific threat it poses to the UK, the\nspecific threat it poses to British nationals overseas, the extent of the\norganisation\u2019s presence in the UK, and the need to support other members of\nthe international community in the global fight against terrorism.\n\nMembers of proscribed organisations or people who invite support for such\ngroups can be jailed for up to 14 years.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Foreign policy\n  * Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office\n  * James Cleverly\n  * Iran\n  * Middle East and north Africa\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### \n\nPolitics Weekly UK\n\nIs China a major threat to British democracy? \u2013 Politics Weekly UK\n\n28 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### UK minister rules out swap for Briton Vladimir Kara-Murza jailed in Russia\n\n19 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### Sunak seeks stature on the global stage \u2013 and to keep trouble away from home\n\n12 Jan 2024\n\n  * ### Rishi Sunak calls for \u2018specific pauses\u2019 in Israel-Hamas conflict\n\n25 Oct 2023\n\n  * ### The Great Jimmy Dimly does the real diplomatic donkey work \u2013 in his dreams\n\n24 Oct 2023\n\n...\n\n...\n\ncomments\n\n  * ### UK minister says west must learn to listen better to global south\n\n20 Sept 2023\n\n  * ### Isolating China would be a mistake, says UK foreign secretary\n\n30 Aug 2023\n\n  * ### UK foreign secretary to challenge China over support for Russia in Ukraine war\n\n29 Aug 2023\n\n  * ### Foreign Office failed to notice torture of British academic in UAE, watchdog finds\n\n4 Aug 2023\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
