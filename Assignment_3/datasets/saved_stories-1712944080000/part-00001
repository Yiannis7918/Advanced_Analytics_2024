The next release of GCC will have\ntheir sources permanently removed.\n\nIA64 is the official sobriquet of Intel's ill-fated Itanium architecture,\nwhich is why The Reg FOSS desk prefers it to \"x64\". x86-64, as invented by AMD\nand thus sometimes called AMD64, was not the first 64-bit architecture in the\ngreater Intel-compatible family, and as for \"x\" \u2013 well, X could mean anything.\n\nThis should not be a big surprise. As we reported while it was still in\ndevelopment, Linux kernel 6.7 accepted a patch to remove IA64 support. There\nwere, predictably, howls of dismay about this but it happened anyway.\n\nAs we reported then, celebrated industry diplomat Linus Torvalds \u2013 who marked\nthe code orphaned in 2021 \u2013 offered a modest proposal for those who wanted to\nkeep the Itanic afloat: maintain it out-of-tree for a year and we'll consider\nmerging it back in again. This didn't happen, and now it won't if the default\ncompiler used to compile the kernel no longer supports generating IA64\nbinaries.\n\n  * PumpkinOS carves out a FOSS PalmOS-compatible runtime environment\n  * Virtually and actually, LXC 6 and Incus 6 are here \u2013 both LTS versions\n  * VMS Software prunes OpenVMS hobbyist program\n  * Canonical cracks down on crypto cons following Snap Store scam spree\n\nAs we discussed when examining Rust support in the kernel, an important angle\nof Linux kernel development is which compiler you use. The kernel is the\nlargest single FOSS software project in the world, and you can't just throw it\nat any old compiler and expect a working result.\n\nThese days, there are two supported compilers: GCC, on multiple architectures,\nand Clang, which is based on LLVM, which primarily supports building kernels\nfor x86-64 and Arm. About 20 years ago, you could build the kernel with Intel\nC [PDF] \u2013 but as of 2021, Intel itself switched to LLVM as the basis of its\nC/C++ compiler.\n\nIt's no surprise. Red Hat let its Itanic version sink some 15 years ago. It\nhas been on its way out of the compiler suite for ages as well: it was\ndeprecated in 2019, and the Linux specialist site Phoronix predicted it would\nbe gone by GCC 11. It took a little longer, but finally, it is disappearing\ninto the inky abyss.\n\nWe thank a Reg reader, who'd prefer to remain anonymous, for the tip. He\ncommented:\n\nI spent much of 1999-2004 porting software to it, which was a prime waste of\ntime and money. I had realised by mid-2001 that it was a turkey.\n\nIt looks like this particular EPIC [PDF] is finally over. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * GNU\n  * Intel\n  * Linux\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * GNU\n  * Intel\n  * Linux\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Alder Lake\n  * Asahi Linux\n  * CentOS\n  * Debian\n  * Fedora\n  * GNOME\n  * Linux Foundation\n  * Mobileye\n  * One Way Forward\n  * Pat Gelsinger\n  * vPro\n  * Windows Subsystem for Linux\n  * x86\n  * Xen\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * FOSS\n  * FPGA\n  * Linus Torvalds\n  * Operating System\n  * Richard Stallman\n\n#### More about\n\n4 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * GNU\n  * Intel\n  * Linux\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * GNU\n  * Intel\n  * Linux\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Alder Lake\n  * Asahi Linux\n  * CentOS\n  * Debian\n  * Fedora\n  * GNOME\n  * Linux Foundation\n  * Mobileye\n  * One Way Forward\n  * Pat Gelsinger\n  * vPro\n  * Windows Subsystem for Linux\n  * x86\n  * Xen\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * FOSS\n  * FPGA\n  * Linus Torvalds\n  * Operating System\n  * Richard Stallman\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Intel Gaudi's third and final hurrah is an AI accelerator built to best\nNvidia's H100\n\nIntel Vision Goodbye dedicated AI hardware and hello to a GPU that fuses Xe\ngraphics DNA with Habana chemistry\n\nSystems3 days | 1\n\n#### Intel's foundry business bled $7B in 2023 with more to come\n\nCEO Gelsinger promises sunny days ahead as he confirms reorg\n\nSystems9 days | 17\n\n#### It's 2024 and Intel silicon is still haunted by data-spilling Spectre\n\nGo, go InSpectre Gadget\n\nResearch2 days | 22\n\n#### A different view from the edge\n\nHow Dell NativeEdge provides the single pane of glass which harmonizes your IT\nand OT perspective\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### Intel courts devs with open arms and exotic hardware\n\nInterview Is Developer Cloud enough to steal Nvidia's thunder?\n\nSoftware10 days |\n\n#### Meteor Lake CPUs splash down in socketed motherboards for edge and\nembedded workloads\n\nIntel reckons the NPUs that power the 'AI PC' are needed on your lap, on the\nedge, but not on the desktop\n\nOn-Prem4 days |\n\n#### German state ditches Windows, Microsoft Office for Linux and LibreOffice\n\n'Complete digital sovereignty' ... sounds familiar\n\nSoftware8 days | 184\n\n#### Intel over the Moon as Lunar Lake\u2019s NPU performance TOPS Meteor Lake\n\nIntel Vision Pat Gelsinger claims 3x performance in next-gen silicon for AI\nPCs\n\nSystems2 days | 1\n\n#### Intel fuels Huawei's AI PC ambitions with Meteor Lake CPUs in MateBook X\nPro\n\nBut for how much longer?\n\nPersonal Tech18 hrs | 1\n\n#### Beijing issues list of approved CPUs \u2013 with no Intel or AMD\n\n2024 may be the year of Linux On The Arm-or-RISC-desktop as China moves away\nfrom Western tech\n\nPublic Sector18 days | 36\n\n#### How this open source LLM chatbot runner hit the gas on x86, Arm CPUs\n\nWay to whip that LLaMA's ass\n\nApplications9 days | 3\n\n#### Intel CEO suggests AI can help to create a one-person Unicorn\n\nIntel Vision And possibly replace entire business units too\n\nAI + ML2 days | 36\n\nThe Register Biting the hand that feeds IT\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Contact us\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Who we are\n\n#### Our Websites\n\n  * The Next Platform\n  * DevClass\n  * Blocks and Files\n\n#### Your Privacy\n\n  * Cookies Policy\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Ts & Cs\n\nCopyright.
