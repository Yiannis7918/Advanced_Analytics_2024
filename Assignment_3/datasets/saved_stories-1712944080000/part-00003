Three icy moons. An eight-year journey. One special\nspacecraft.\n\nBuilding a mission to Jupiter took years of planning and thousands of people.\nNow that Juice is finally en route to its destination, our documentary \u2018The\nmaking of Juice\u2019 takes a look behind the scenes at the development and testing\nof the spacecraft in the three years leading up to launch. We hear from Juice\nProject Manager, Giuseppe Sarri, about how and why the film was made.\n\nDuring autumn 2019, Olivier Witasse (Juice Project Scientist) and I were\ndiscussing the long-term plan for Juice outreach and we came up with the idea\nof filming key moments in the final stages of the development and testing of\nJuice. That year in March we\u2019d had the \u2018Critical Design Review\u2019, which gave\nthe green light to integrate and test the Juice spacecraft. It seemed just the\nright moment to start recording our progress, with the idea to capture not\nonly the technical aspects but, above all, the human elements of this very\nchallenging endeavour.\n\nOlivier knew Maarten Roos who, besides being a well-known maker of space\nscience movies, is a planetary scientist with a deep understanding of Jupiter.\nOlivier met Maarten in October 2019 to brainstorm over a coffee at Leiden\nCentraal train station. A first draft of the concept was proposed and\ndiscussed all together in December, and the activity kicked off in January\n2020. After the first interviews with Olivier and myself in late February\n2020, the COVID-19 pandemic hit the project hard, as you can see from many\ninterviewees wearing masks. But we managed!\n\nMaarten was collecting so much special content, and we did not want to wait\nthe launch of Juice to show it publicly. So he came up with the idea of\nregularly (every two to three months) releasing self-standing movies, each\nabout five minutes long, to keep the public updated on the development of the\nspacecraft. With little imagination we called them \u2018episodes\u2019 and we released\n12 of them. We also released 17 one-minute videos, which we called \u2018snippets\nof action\u2019.\n\nAfter the launch of Juice, on 14 April 2023, Maarten combined everything\ntogether into one full-length documentary, and here we are: \u2018The Making of\nJuice\u2019 is ready for release. It includes stunning images of the integration\nand launch of the spacecraft; interviews with engineers, technicians,\nscientists and managers; and animations explaining the mission and its\nscientific objectives. It is an entertaining movie, easy to watch, telling the\nstory of Juice from initial conception to the start of its voyage to Jupiter.\nAnd it shows that behind all great projects are great people.\n\nThe making of Juice: the film Access the video\n\nThank you for liking\n\nYou have already liked this page, you can only like it once!\n\nEuropean Space Agency\n\nFAQ Contacts Terms and conditions Privacy notice Careers at ESA Subscribe\n\n", "frontpage": false}
