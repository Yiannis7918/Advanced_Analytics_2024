Every\ntime I thought I was safe, he\u2019d wait a couple months and renew his attack:\n\n> \u201cWhen are you going to write about seed oils?\u201d\n>\n> \u201cDid you know that seed oils are why there\u2019s so much {obesity, heart\n> disease, diabetes, inflammation, cancer, dementia}?\u201d\n>\n> \u201cWhy did you write about {meth, the death penalty, consciousness, nukes,\n> ethylene, abortion, AI, aliens, colonoscopies, Tunnel Man, Bourdieu,\n> Assange} when you could have written about seed oils?\u201d\n>\n> \u201cIsn\u2019t it time to quit your silly navel-gazing and use your weird obsessive\n> personality to make a dent in the world\u2014by writing about seed oils?\u201d\n\nHe\u2019d often send screenshots of people reminding each other that Corn Oil is\nMurder and that it\u2019s critical that we overturn our lives to eliminate\nsoybean/canola/sunflower/peanut oil and replace them with\nbutter/lard/coconut/avocado/palm oil.\n\nThis confused me, because on my internet, no one cares. Few have heard of\nthese theories and those that have mostly think they\u2019re kooky. When I looked\nfor evidence that seed oils were bad, I\u2019d find people with long lists of\npapers. Those papers each seemed vaguely concerning, but I couldn\u2019t find any\n\u201creputable\u201d sources that said seed oils were bad. This made it hard for me to\ntake the idea seriously.\n\nBut my friend kept asking. He even brought up the idea of paying me, before\nrecoiling in horror at my suggested rate. But now I appear to be writing about\nseed oils for free. So I guess that works?\n\n##\n\nContents\n\n  * On seed oil theory\n\n  * On fat\n\n  * The outside view\n\n  * The inside view\n\n  * On distraction\n\n##\n\nOn seed oil theory\n\n###\n\nThere is no one seed oil theory.\n\nI can\u2019t emphasize this enough: There is no clear \u201cbest\u201d argument for why seed\noils are supposed to be bad. This stuff is coming from internet randos (\u2661) who\ndiffer both in what they think is true, and why they think it. But we can\nexamine some common arguments.\n\n###\n\nWe ate seed oil and we got fat.\n\nOne argument is that for most of human history, nobody dieted and everyone was\nlean. But some time after the industrial revolution, people in Western\ncountries started gaining weight and things have accelerated ever since.\nHere\u2019s BMI at age 50 for white, high-school educated American men born in\nvarious years:\n\nFor the last few decades, obesity (BMI \u226530) has grown at around 0.6% per year.\nClearly we are doing something wrong. We evolved to effortlessly stay at a\nhealthy weight, but we\u2019ve somehow broken our regulatory mechanisms. Anywhere\npeople adopt a Western diet, the same thing happens.\n\nOf course, the Western diet is many things. But if you start reading\ningredients lists, you\u2019ll soon notice that everything has vegetable oil in it.\nAnything fried, obviously, but also instant noodles, chips, crackers,\ntortillas, cereal, energy bars, canned tuna, processed meats, plant-based\nmeat, coffee creamer, broths, frozen dinners, salad dressing, and sauces.\nAlso: Baby food, infant formula, and sometimes even ice cream or bread. People\neat a lot more vegetable oil than they used to (figure from Lee et al.\n(2022)):\n\nMany vegetable oils (and particularly seed oils) are high in linoleic acid.\nAnd guess what\u2019s making up a rapidly increasing fraction of body fat? (figure\nfrom Stephan Guyunet):\n\nEven many types of meat now have high linoleic acid levels, because the\nanimals are now eating so much vegetable oil. It\u2019s plausible this is doing\nsomething to us.\n\n###\n\nAnd seed oils are highly processed.\n\nAnother common argument is that even if we can\u2019t identify exactly where the\nWestern diet went wrong, we know that we spent almost our whole evolutionary\nhistory eating like hunter-gathers (and most of the rest eating like\nsubsistence farmers). And hunter-gatherers are all thin. So maybe we should\neat like they did?\n\nThat sounds kind of fanciful, but consider the most conventional dietary\nadvice, the thing that every expert screams every time they have a\nchance\u2014AVOID PROCESSED FOOD.\n\nThe USDA defines processing as:\n\n> washing, cleaning, milling, cutting, chopping, heating, pasteurizing,\n> blanching, cooking, canning, freezing, drying, dehydrating, mixing, or other\n> procedures that alter the food from its natural state. This may include the\n> addition of other ingredients to the food, such as preservatives, flavors,\n> nutrients and other food additives or substances approved for use in food\n> products, such as salt, sugars and fats.\n\nBasically, don\u2019t do... anything? That sounds awfully similar to eating like a\nhunter-gatherer. It\u2019s unclear why many of these types of processing would be\nharmful. (Cooking? Washing?) But maybe that\u2019s smart\u2014maybe biology and\nnutrition are so complicated that we shouldn\u2019t even try to understand them.\n\nTraditional oils involve some processing, but they\u2019re pretty easy. To make\nbutter, you milk a cow and churn the milk. To make olive oil, you grind some\nolives and press them. To make lard, you take a beautiful pig with hopes and\ndreams, you kill it, you cut off the fattiest bits, and then you boil them and\nstrain.\n\nBut here\u2019s how you make canola oil: Take rapeseeds, put them through a\nvibrating sieve, then a roller mill, then a screw press, then do a hexane\nextraction, then do a sodium hydroxide wash in a centrifuge, then cool and\nfilter out wax, then pass through bleaching clay, then do a steam injection in\na vacuum. Whatever comes out of this is not something your DNA anticipates.\n\n###\n\nAnd some studies say seed oils are bad.\n\nAnother argument is that seed oils are bad experimentally. Even if you don\u2019t\nunderstand how nutrition works, you can still try stuff\u2014e.g. you can have\npeople replace animal fat (or saturated fat) with vegetable oil (or\nunsaturated fat) and see if this makes them healthier. Usually, such trials\nwere done with the expectation that they\u2019d show vegetable oils were healthier.\nAnd often they do. But in a couple cases\u2014notably the Sydney Diet Heart Study,\nand the Minnesota Coronary Survey\u2014the groups with more vegetable oil did\nworse, not better.\n\n###\n\nAnd there are plausible mechanisms.\n\nOur last argument is that we know how seed oils hurt you. People seem to\nsuggest five possible mechanisms:\n\n  1. Maybe linoleic acid (common in seed oils) is metabolized into arachidonic acid, and thereby causes inflammation.\n\n  2. Maybe linoleic acid becomes oxidized LDL and thereby causes inflammation.\n\n  3. Maybe it\u2019s the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fats you eat that matters.\n\n  4. Maybe vegetable oil doesn\u2019t make you feel full like animal fats do, meaning vegetable oils lead to overeating.\n\n  5. Maybe vegetable oils have an increased propensity to become trans fats.\n\n(Details in footnote1)\n\n##\n\nOn fat\n\n###\n\nThere are many kinds of fat.\n\nWhen first trying to make sense of these arguments, I encountered terms like\n\u201ccis medium-chain omega-7 polyunsaturated fat\u201d, which left me confused and\nterrified. (Biochemistry\u2019s enormity has always had a way of making me feel\ninsignificant.) After looking into things, I\u2019m still quite scared, but at\nleast I\u2019ve made the Dynomight Fatty Acid Classifier.\n\nFat is made of fatty acids\u2014chains of carbon atoms linked via hydrogen bonds.\nUsually, these are \u201csingle\u201d bonds. But sometimes there are \u201cdouble\u201d bonds,\nwhich are very important because they are easier to break apart. So different\nfatty acids are categorized mostly based on the double bonds. So, behold:\n\nIf you want, you can further divide things up in terms of the length of the\nfatty acid, or even count how many single bonds there are between each double\nbond.\n\n###\n\nDifferent oils have different fats.\n\nHere\u2019s a picture (simplified from Mikael H\u00e4ggstr\u00f6m\u2019s version):\n\nAnimal fat tends to be high in saturated and monounsaturated fat while\nvegetable oil tends to be high in polyunsaturated fat. But there are a few\nnotable exceptions (not all listed above):\n\n  * Olive oil, canola oil, and avocado oil are high in monounsaturated fat.\n\n  * Coconut oil is high in saturated fat.\n\n  * Palm oil has both saturated and monounsaturated fat, but little polyunsaturated fat.\n\nOf course, you can also break things down into different subcategories of fats\nor even individual fatty acids.\n\n###\n\nTrans fat is bad.\n\nThe double bonds in fatty acids have two possible configurations. They can be\n\u201cnormal\u201d (cis) or they can be \u201creversed\u201d in a way that leaves the rest of the\nfatty acid chain \u201cflipped\u201d (trans). (The Dynomight Biologist howls in protest\nat this description, but is overruled.)\n\nStarting around 100 years ago, people noticed you could \u201chydrogenate\u201d\nunsaturated fats by heating them and cramming in extra hydrogen atoms. If this\nis done completely, it will transform all the double bonds into single bonds,\nchanging the unsaturated fat into saturated fat. This gives something similar\nto lard, but cheaper. You probably eat hydrogenated vegetable oils all the\ntime\u2014they\u2019re used for \u201cshortening\u201d and are in icing and all sorts of baked and\nfried foods.\n\nBut if you don\u2019t fully hydrogenate the oil you end up with\u2014you guessed\nit\u2014partially hydrogenated oil, in which many of the natural cis bonds will be\nconverted to trans bonds. Partially hydrogenated oils are cheap, have high\nshelf lives, and can easily be made in a range of consistencies.\n\nThat\u2019s a shame because trans fats are pretty rare in nature (maybe 3% of\nbutter/canola oil, around 0.5% of olive oil) and evolution doesn\u2019t seem to\nhave prepared us to eat large amounts of them. The WHO calls them \u201cdeadly\u201d.\nIts consensus that they cause obesity, diabetes, and heart disease, though the\nmechanism of harm often still isn\u2019t understood. Trans fats started being\nphased out around the world about 25 years ago. But before that happened, they\nwere estimated to cause 30k to 100k deaths per year in the United States.\n\nSo, don\u2019t eat trans fats.\n\nAbout that, bad news\u2014if you cook with unsaturated fat at high temperature you\ncan make your own trans fats right in your kitchen. Though it seems like not\nmuch happens if you stay below 200\u00b0C, and even with high temperatures and long\ntimes, it\u2019s hard to get above 8%. Still, deep-frying with the same oil for\ndays on end seems like a bad idea.\n\nAnd a note for Americans: If your food has less than 0.5 grams of trans fats\nper serving, then it can legally be labeled as having \u201czero\u201d trans fat.\nCooking oils typically have a serving size of a tablespoon (14g), meaning that\nthe \u201czero trans fat\u201d threshold is around 3.6% trans fat. Companies apparently\nrespond to this by diluting their trans-fat-containing products with regular\nvegetable oil just enough to get down to 3.6%. Ain\u2019t capitalism grand?\n\nAnyway, trans fats seem like a good lesson about unintended consequences and\nhow we should be careful about screwing around with what we eat.\n\nTrans fats are also sometimes suggested as a reason that animal fats might be\nhealthier than vegetable fats: Animal fats are mostly saturated fat, and\nsaturated fat cannot become trans because it has no double bonds.\n\n##\n\nThe outside view\n\n###\n\nMuch of this is plausible.\n\nThere\u2019s lots to like about seed oil theory. I\u2019m sympathetic to the idea that\nthe modern Western diet is somehow fundamentally broken. (Look at what\u2019s\nhappening to us!) Even if we don\u2019t understand exactly why, it looks like\n\u201cprocessing\u201d is bad, and seed oils sure are processed.\n\nThe suggested mechanisms for seed oils to be harmful seem plausible, too. I\ncould believe that omega-6 fats cause oxidization or inflammation or that\nsaturated fats might make you feel more full. Experts seem to agree that most\npeople should eat more omega-3 fats.\n\nAnd if you want a monocausal story for every modern health problem,\ninflammation is a good mechanism. We have other cases where one source of\ninflammation causes a range of seemingly unrelated health problems (e.g. air\npollution).\n\nFinally, seed oil theorists often suggest replacing unsaturated fat with\nsaturated fat. This conflicts with the old consensus that saturated fat\nincreases the risk of heart disease. But there seems to be increasing doubt\nabout that old consensus (Astrup et al. 2020). Many still defend it, but\nthere\u2019s real debate.\n\nSo that\u2019s good. But there are also reasons for doubt.\n\n###\n\nBut correlation \u21cf causation.\n\nJust because two things happened at the same time doesn\u2019t mean one caused the\nother. Maybe there\u2019s some causal relationship, or maybe it\u2019s just random.\nLet\u2019s not belabor this.\n\n###\n\nAnd it\u2019s a complex mechanistic argument.\n\nYes, there are plausible mechanisms for seed oils to hurt us. I agree! But\ncomplex mechanistic arguments for diet do not have a good track record. So far\nthey\u2019ve worked for... basically nothing? (We\u2019re still debating if eating salt\nor cholesterol are bad for you.)\n\nWhen humans build complex systems we modularize, so we can understand what\u2019s\nhappening. But evolution is a lunatic. It doesn\u2019t care about understanding. So\nbiological systems tend to be spectacularly non-modularized. When I started\nreading Molecular Biology of the Cell I almost felt like I wanted to throw up,\nwhat with all the exceptions to the exceptions to the exceptions.\n\nDid you know that dogs sneeze to signal they\u2019re feeling playful? I guess this\nhappened because evolution wanted a way to signal playfulness, so why not just\nuse an existing instinct for expelling particles? It\u2019s a little confusing, but\nno big deal, right? Our bodies are a collection of millions of these kinds of\nhacks stacked on top of each other.\n\nMaybe the mechanisms people give for seed oils are right. I\u2019m no expert, and\nI\u2019ve exhausted the patience of everyone I know who is. But there are 8 billion\nother interacting mechanisms. Above all, I don\u2019t understand why seed oil\ntheorists are so damned confident. It\u2019s fine to speculate about mechanisms,\nbut you do that for choosing what to investigate experimentally, not as a\nfinal source of truth.\n\n###\n\nAnd seed oil theories have features that make them hard to falsify.\n\nFor example:\n\n  * There are many variants of these theories. Is it all vegetable oil that\u2019s bad, or just seed oil? Is olive oil OK? Or is it unsaturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, omega-6 fat, or just linoleic acid? Is it the omega-6:3 ratio, and if so then why avoid canola oil with its extremely low ratio? People who criticize one theory are often told they aren\u2019t arguing against the One True seed oil theory. But what is that?\n\n  * Say some study gives some people more seed oil, and those people are fine. Is that evidence against seed oil theory? Some say no, because the harms of seed oil are nonlinear\u2014they mostly hurt you when you cross over some threshold. If people were already past that threshold before the study started, then adding additional seed oil wouldn\u2019t do more harm.\n\n  * Or say you reduce seed oils and don\u2019t get healthier. Evidence against seed oil theory? Again, some say no, because you can\u2019t \u201cun-ring the bell\u201d. When you eat seed oils, you cause your body to get dis-regulated. But fixing your diet won\u2019t make you well-regulated again, because the damage is done.\n\n  * People often report switching seed oils out for saturated fats and failing to lose weight. A common response is they should look at waistline size, not total weight.\n\n  * Say some trial shows that reducing sugar has a big effect. That might suggest that that seed oils aren\u2019t everything. But some just see this as further proof of seed oil\u2019s primacy\u2014it\u2019s because of seed oil that the sugar is able to do harm.\n\nAll of these things are possible. Maybe an invisible dragon really does live\nin your garage. But the more such features a theory has, the less I trust it.\n\n###\n\nSome seed oil theorists are selling stuff.\n\nSome of the big seed oil theorists run companies that sell seed-oil free\nproducts. I guess this is a conflict of interest, but... if you thought seed\noils were killing everyone, wouldn\u2019t you want to help provide alternatives?\nI\u2019m more worried about the internet\u2019s usual trick of corrupting everything by\nshowering attention on the overconfident.\n\n##\n\nThe inside view\n\n###\n\nHuman RCTs mostly say saturated fat is bad.\n\nIf you replace butter with seed oil, what happens? The best way to answer this\nquestion is to try it. Fortunately, many trials have been done. I stress:\nmany. In such cases, we shouldn\u2019t stress about individual results because\nanything can happen in one trial, from p-hacking to fraud to contaminated\ncoconut oil.\n\nThe thing to do is look at trials as a whole. Ideally, using a standard\nmethodology. Enter Hooper et al. (2020), who did a honking meta-analysis of\nrandomized trials in which saturated fat was reduced as part of the (highly\nrespected) Cochrane project. They found that getting more of your overall\nenergy from saturated fat was bad:\n\nIn more detail, they found that the groups that got less saturated fat:\n\n  * Had a 21% reduction in cardiovascular events.\n\n  * Had small (3-6%) non-statistically significant reductions in overall mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and cancer.\n\n  * Had cholesterol that looked slightly better by most measures\n\n  * Were an average of 1.8 kg (4 lb) lighter.\n\n  * Had no apparent change in cancer mortality, diabetes, or blood pressure.\n\nThis seemed to be true regardless of if saturated fat was replaced with\npolyunsaturated fat or carbohydrates. (There were few trials where it was\nreplaced with monounsaturated fats or protein.)\n\nThese meta-analyses are our most important information. Averaged over decades\nof studies, replacing saturated fats with polyunsaturated fats (i.e. replacing\nbutter with seed oil) seems to be good for you, not bad for you.\n\nI don\u2019t see this as a conclusive, or even close to conclusive. We really need\nmore, bigger, better trials. But at the moment, the experimental evidence\nsuggest vegetable oil is good, not bad.\n\n###\n\nThere\u2019s no conspiracy against the Sydney Diet Heart Study.\n\nThe Sydney Diet Heart Study study ran from 1966 to 1973. In it, 458 middle-\naged men with a recent coronary event were randomized to either continue their\nnormal diet or to substitute safflower (seed) oil for saturated fat. The group\nwith the extra seed oil had lower cholesterol, but did worse both in terms of\nall-cause mortality, and cardiovascular disease.\n\nSeed oil theorists talk about this trial a lot. It was a good trial! And the\nresults aren\u2019t good for seed oil. But it is included in the meta-analysis.\nLook:\n\nIn analysis after analysis, it\u2019s sitting there, being taken into account.\nAlong with all the other studies, which mostly don\u2019t support the same\nconclusion. The Nutrivore points out that the vegetable oil group got Miracle\nbrand margarine which was high in trans fats. That could explain their poor\nresults, but the other group was surely eating some trans fats too, and this\nkind of single-trial nitpicking makes me nervous.\n\n###\n\nThere\u2019s no conspiracy against the Minnesota Coronary Survey either.\n\nThe Minnesota Coronary Survey ran from 1968 to 1973. There\u2019s a story floating\naround that goes something like this: This was a huge trial with 9,423\nsubjects in nursing homes and mental hospitals. For the experimental group,\nthey replaced saturated fat with vegetable oil rich in lionleic acid. They\nexpected this to decrease heart disease, but when the opposite happened, the\ninvestigators just kind of dropped things. These \u201cinconvenient\u201d results were\nmostly ignored until 43 years later, Ramsden et al. (2016) came around and\nrecovered the old data.\n\nWhen I read this story I was pumping my fist. Fixing publication bias by\nscrounging up lost data from decades ago! Yes! But when I looked into the\ndetails, that story is mostly bogus. The main results of this trial have been\navailable for decades. Here is Figure 6 from Frantz et al. (1989), which\nclearly shows that the control group does a bit better:\n\nSome say that even if the results were published, they were ignored before\nRamsden et al., but that\u2019s not true either. Check the citations if you\nwant\u2014most come before 2016.\n\nNow, this study is not in the meta-analysis. They excluded it because there\nwere high dropout rates, meaning the average subject was only in the trial for\nonly one year. It was also very weird by modern standards\u2014they created fake\nmeat and cheese where the natural fats were replaced with vegetable oil.\n(There\u2019s a whole sub-debate debate about if that vegetable oil contained trans\nfat. We\u2019ll probably never know because the records are lost and no one who\nmight remember is still alive.)\n\nThe exclusion of this study is no conspiracy. Lots of trials where vegetable\noils look great were also excluded. For example, the legendary Finnish Mental\nHospital trial ran for 12 years and found that a similar (also weird) diet\nreduced heart disease by almost 50% and overall mortality by 11%. It was\nexcluded because it used a crossover design rather than randomization.\n\nIf you want different inclusion criteria, fine! Argue that your criteria are\nbetter, and do a new meta-analysis. But ad-hoc inclusion and exclusion of\nindividual studies is a recipe for getting answers that fit with your\npreconceptions. Just look at the track record of using polling data to predict\nelections.\n\n###\n\nPublic health authorities mostly say saturated fat is bad.\n\nI\u2019ve seen people claim that public health authorities in \u201cother countries\u201d\nsupport substituting saturated fats for unsaturated fats. This, for the\nrecord, is untrue. I looked up the official advice of all the G7 countries\nplus the WHO, Spain and Australia2:\n\nSeed oil folks often bring up the French paradox, the (controversial) claim\nthat French people are/were thin and have low cardiovascular disease despite\neating lots saturated-fat-rich croissants or whatever. And I guess France\ncomes closest to the seed oil position, since they don\u2019t endorse vegetable\noils and suggest increasing \u03b1-LA, an omega-3 fat. But France still says to\nlimit saturated fat. Japan seems focused on other things.\n\n###\n\nSeed oils don\u2019t seem to cause inflammation.\n\nThe most comprehensive meta-review I could find (Johnson and Fritsche, 2012)\nlooked at trials of trials that increased linoleic acid or omega-6 fats\n(basically, seed oils). It found that \u201cvirtually no data\u201d existed to support\nthe idea that this increased inflammation.\n\nBeyond that, the suggested \u201cLA \u2192 AA\u201d mechanism seems to be basically\ndisproven. The problem is that metabolism of lionoleic acid (LA) into\narachidonic acid (AA) saturates at low levels of LA consumption (Liou and\nInnis (2009). A meta-review (Rett and Whelan, 2011) found that many different\ntrials that decreased LA by up to 90% or increased it by up to 600% all seemed\nto do basically nothing:\n\n###\n\nIt\u2019s not clear if the timelines work out.\n\nTrue, seed oil consumption has skyrocketed along with obesity. But hold on. If\nseed oil consumption is causing obesity, then people should have started\ngetting fat after seed oils started increasing. Did they?\n\nBlasbalg et al. (2011) give some long-term estimates of vegetable oil\nconsumption: (Note the scale is smaller in the lower plot.)\n\nHow early would obesity have to have started increasing to falsify the idea\nthat it\u2019s caused by seed/vegetable oil? 1970? 1940? Earlier?\n\nNow, when did people start gaining weight? This is tricky, because nobody was\ncollecting BMI statistics back in the 1700s. But Kromlos and Brabec (2010) use\na set of surveys taken between 1959 and 1994 and fit a regression to predict\nweight at age 50 from birth year. They then use this to extrapolate back to\npeople born as early as 1882. (I think because someone born in 1882 would have\nbeen 77\u2014and still hopefully alive\u2014in 1959?) This gives this graph we saw\nearlier, with a long term trend of people at the median gaining around 0.05\nBMI/year:\n\nWhile it looks like people were getting heavier back in the 1880s, I emphasize\nthat the evidence is very weak: The leftmost part of the plot is an estimate\nfor men born in 1882 in 1932 (when they were 50) based on data collected in\n1959.\n\nThere\u2019s also data for the incoming classes at a couple military academies.\nHiermeyer (2010) collects data for people entering West Point and the Citadel:\n\nMaybe West Point cadets got a little heavier? There\u2019s a 20 year run, so at\n0.05 BMI/year we\u2019d only expect an increase of 1 BMI, close to what\u2019s observed.\nBut the Citadel, if anything is decreasing. Coclanis and Komlos (1997) give\nmore Citadel data, stratified by the age of the students:\n\nAgain, it looks like not much changed between those born in the 1870s and the\n1900s. But things started to pick up for those born in the 1920s.\n\nAll this data suggest people starting getting heavier during the 1920s or even\nearlier, when seed oil consumption was still very low. So I see this as some\nevidence against seed oil theory.\n\nOf course, none of this data is very good. Surely there\u2019s more long-term data\non weight lurking out there somewhere? Typically, seed oil theorists point at\ndata only going back to 1970 or so, but that will never prove anything, since\nobesity was already increasing at that time. We need to go back further.\n\n###\n\nOmega-6 doesn\u2019t explain inter-country obesity.\n\nPeople in different countries eat different amounts of seed oil. If eating\nseed oil makes you fat, then must per-country seed oil consumption correlate\nwith per-country obesity?\n\nNot necessarily, no. But I decided to check anyway. I found the WHO provides\nsome amazing data for obesity\u2014the estimated fraction of the population that\nhas a BMI of at least 30 by year. Here\u2019s what that looked like in 2010.\n\n(There\u2019s no data for South Sudan because it didn\u2019t exist in 2010. There\u2019s no\ndata for Antarctica because all the people there are penguins. I think there\u2019s\nno data for Greenland/French Guiana because they\u2019re considered part of\nDenmark/France. There\u2019s no data for Taiwan because the WHO is afraid of China.\nI don\u2019t know the deal with Turkey and Kosovo.)\n\nThe USA isn\u2019t quite #1\u2014It\u2019s beaten by Egypt, the Bahamas, Kuwait, and a bunch\nof tiny island nations. American Samoa is way ahead at 71.63%.\n\nAnyway, seed oil consumption data is harder to find, but Micha et al. (2014)\ngive estimates for 2010. Here\u2019s estimated omega-6 consumption:\n\nCan you see a relationship with obesity? I couldn\u2019t, so I made a scatterplot\nwith one circle per country. (You can zoom in and see country codes.)\n\nIs anything there? Maybe so, I\u2019m not sure. I did the same for saturated fat\nand all fat, which look about equally convincing. But if you put per-capita\nGDP on the x-axis...\n\nCould it be that something else is going on here?\n\n##\n\nOn distraction\n\nA weak version of seed oil theory is that seed oils are highly processed, so\nwhy not use cold-pressed olive oil instead? If that\u2019s the theory, fine. In\nfact, this is mostly what I do myself. I figure it might be useless, but it\u2019s\nunlikely to be harmful, and olive oil is delicious.\n\nAnd I wouldn\u2019t be shocked if one of the suggested mechanisms for seed oil\nturns out to be valid. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised at all if some mechanism turned\nout to part of a larger, more complicated story.\n\nAnd in practice, avoiding seed oils is probably really good for you, because\nit forces you to eliminate most of the processed crap you shouldn\u2019t be eating\nanyway.\n\nA middle-strength theory would be that seed oils might be harmful, so it\u2019s\nsafest to reduce seed oils and replace them with saturated fat. I disagree\nwith this, because the balance of evidence says that saturated fat is more\nrisky than unsaturated fat (monounsaturated or polyunsaturated). But I guess\nit\u2019s not totally crazy.\n\nBut seed oil theorists mostly seem to push a much stronger theory: We know\nthat seed oils are the cause of Western disease.\n\nI\u2019ll just be honest. I think this view is completely indefensible. I feel\nembarrassed when I see people promoting it. You\u2019re sure? How? I don\u2019t see any\nway to get to this conclusion other than heavily filtering the\nevidence\u2014ignoring the flaws in everything that supports a predetermined view\nwhile scrambling to find flaws in everything that contradicts it.\n\nAgain, I\u2019m sure you can send me long lists of random citations. (You don\u2019t\nneed to send them; it\u2019s OK; I\u2019ve seen them already.) But for anything that\u2019s\nbeen studied in detail, there\u2019s always lots of evidence to support any semi-\nplausible view. Do you have any idea how much evidence people can produce for\nUFOs or chronic Lyme or colloidal silver?\n\nMy real worry about seed oil theory is that it\u2019s a distraction. If you want to\nbe healthier, we know ways you can change your diet that will help: Increase\nyour overall diet \u201cquality\u201d. Eat lots of fruits and vegetables. Avoid\nprocessed food. Especially avoid processed meats. Eat food with low caloric\ndensity. Avoid added sugar. Avoid alcohol. Avoid processed food.\n\nI know this is hard. You could even argue it\u2019s unrealistic. That wouldn\u2019t make\nit wrong.\n\nLook, I wish strong seed oil theory were true. That would be great. All we\u2019d\nhave to do is reformulate our Cheetos with different oil, and then we could go\non merrily eating Cheetos. Western diet without Western disease! Sadly, I\nthink this is very unlikely.\n\n1\n\nThe first is LA \u2192 AA. This story goes something like this:\n\n  * Seed oil have lots of linoleic acid (LA). LA isn\u2019t inflammatory. In fact, if you didn\u2019t eat any LA, you would die.\n\n  * But LA gets metabolized into arachidonic acid (AA).\n\n  * AA isn\u2019t inflammatory either, but gets metabolized into some inflammatory signaling molecules.\n\n  * (AA is also metabolized into some anti-inflammatory signaling molecules, and various other stuff, did I mention this was complicated?)\n\nThe second is LA \u2192 oxidized LDL. This story goes:\n\n  * The body is constantly making LDL, a molecule that carries cholesterol around.\n\n  * If you eat lots of LA, you tend to have lots of LA in your LDL. This seems to increases the odds that oxygen will screw with the structure of the LDL, giving you oxidized LDL.\n\n  * Normally, cells take up LDL so they can use the cholesterol. (That\u2019s the point of LDL.) But if the LDL is oxidized, cells don\u2019t recognize it. So instead, oxidized LDL is eaten by macrophage immune cells.\n\n  * This initiates an inflammatory response, which might lead to various bad things like plaques or artery hardening.\n\nThe third is omega-6:3 ratios. The claim is that seed oils have lots of \u201comega\n6\u201d fats (like LA) that do inflammatory stuff, but that wouldn\u2019t be a problem\nas long as you ate lots of \u201comega 3\u201d fats too, because omega-3 fats have anti-\noxidant properties. Historically we used to get a lot more omega-3 fats than\nwe do now.\n\nThe fourth mechanism is saturated fat free radicals. The claim is that the\ncitric acid cycle produces free radicals when you eat saturated fat, but not\nunsaturated fat. But maybe those free radicals make you feel full, meaning\nthat eating too much unsaturated fat leads to overeating.\n\nWe\u2019ll discuss trans fats later.\n\n2\n\nLinks: WHO, United States, Germany, UK, France, Italy, Spain, Canada,\nAustralia, Japan\n\n### Subscribe to DYNOMIGHT INTERNET NEWSLETTER\n\nBy dynomight \u00b7 Launched 3 years ago\n\nscience and existential angst\n\n18 Likes\n\n15\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Thoughts on seed oil\n\ndynomight.substack.com\n\n4\n\nShare\n\n4 Comments\n\nDH2 hrs agoThank you for that excellent analysis.I am always suspicious of\nmono-factorial explanations of any complex phenomenon, whether it be obesity\nor climate change.
