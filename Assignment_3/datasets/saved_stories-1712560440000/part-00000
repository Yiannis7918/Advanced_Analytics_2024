It provides navigational support, data\ninput, hyperlinks, text and image presentation, and forms, much like HTML\n(Hypertext Markup Language). It preceded the use of other markup languages\nused with WAP, such as XHTML and HTML itself, which achieved dominance as\nprocessing power in mobile devices increased.\n\n## WML history[edit]\n\nBuilding on Openwave's HDML, Nokia's \"Tagged Text Markup Language\" (TTML) and\nEricsson's proprietary markup language for mobile content, the WAP Forum\ncreated the WML 1.1 standard in 1998.^[1] WML 2.0 was specified in 2001,^[2]\nbut has not been widely adopted. It was an attempt at bridging WML and XHTML\nBasic before the WAP 2.0 spec was finalized.^[3] In the end, XHTML Mobile\nProfile became the markup language used in WAP 2.0. The newest WML version in\nactive use is 1.3.\n\nThe first company to launch a public WML site was Dutch mobile phone network\noperator Telfort in October 1999 and the first company in the world to launch\nthe Nokia 7110. The Telfort WML site was created and developed as side project\nto test the device's capabilities by a billing engineer called Christopher Bee\nand National Deployment Manager, Euan McLeod. The WML site consists of four\npages in both Dutch and English that contained many grammatical errors in\nDutch as the two developers were unaware the WML was configured on the Nokia\n7110 as the home page and neither were native Dutch speakers.\n\n## WML markup[edit]\n\nWML documents are XML documents that validate against the WML DTD (Document\nType Definition)^[4] . The W3C Markup Validation service\n(http://validator.w3.org/) can be used to validate WML documents (they are\nvalidated against their declared document type).\n\nFor example, the following WML page could be saved as \"example.wml\":\n\n    \n    \n    <?xml version=\"1.0\"?> <!DOCTYPE wml PUBLIC \"-//WAPFORUM//DTD WML 1.1//EN\" \"http://www.wapforum.org/DTD/wml_1.1.xml\" > <wml> <head> <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> </head> <card id=\"main\" title=\"First Card\"> <p mode=\"wrap\">This is a sample WML page.</p> </card> </wml>\n\nA WML document is known as a \u201cdeck\u201d. Data in the deck is structured into one\nor more \u201ccards\u201d (pages) \u2013 each of which represents a single interaction with\nthe user.\n\nWML decks are stored on an ordinary web server configured to serve the\ntext/vnd.wap.wml MIME type in addition to plain HTML and variants. The WML\ncards when requested by a device are accessed by a bridge (WAP gateway), which\nsits between mobile devices and the World Wide Web, passing pages from one to\nthe other much like a proxy. The gateways send the WML pages on in a form\nsuitable for mobile device reception (WAP Binary XML). This process is hidden\nfrom the phone, so it may access the page in the same way as a browser\naccesses HTML, using a URL (for example, http://example.com/foo.wml).\n(Provided the mobile phone operator has not specifically locked the phone to\nprevent access of user-specified URLs.)\n\nWML has a scaled-down set of procedural elements which can be used by the\nauthor to control navigation to other cards.\n\nConsider a service that lets you enter a zip code, and obtain a list of\nclickable phone numbers of pizza parlors and taxicabs in your immediate\nlocation:\n\n    \n    \n    <card id=\"cM\" title=\"MY_DOMAIN.com\"> <p> Call A Taxi: <a href=\"wtai://wp/mc;%2B19035551212\">903-555-1212</a> </p> </card>\n\nMobile devices are moving towards allowing more XHTML and even standard HTML\nas processing power in handsets increases. These standards are concerned with\nformatting and presentation. They do not however address cell-phone or mobile\ndevice hardware interfacing in the same way as WML.\n\n## WML capability in desktop browsers[edit]\n\nScreenshot of WMLBrowser on Mozilla Firefox\n\nThe Presto layout engine (used by Opera before its switch to Blink) understood\nWML natively. Mozilla based browsers (Firefox (before its update to version\n57), SeaMonkey, MicroB) could interpret WML through WMLBrowser addon. Google\nChrome can also interpret WML via two extensions: WML and FireMobileSimulator.\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\nMain article: Wireless Application Protocol \u00a7 Criticism\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * WMLScript\n  * Wireless Application Protocol Bitmap Format\n  * Mobile browser\n  * List of document markup languages\n  * Comparison of document markup languages\n  * XHTML Mobile Profile\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ The HCI blog: A brief History of WAP\n  2. ^ WAP Forum: \"Wireless Markup Language (WML) 2.0 Document Type Definition\"\n  3. ^ Openwave Developer Network: \"One quick note about WML 2.0\"\n  4. ^ WAP Forum: \"Wireless Markup Language (WML) 1.3 Document Type Definition\"\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n  * Technical Specifications at the WAP Forum\n  * XHTML-MP Authoring Practices\n  * Open Mobile Alliance\n\n  * v\n  * t\n  * e\n\nStandards of Open Mobile Alliance  \n---  \nStandards|\n\n  * FUMO\n  * MMS\n  * OMA BCAST\n  * OMA CP\n  * OMA DM\n  * OMA DRM\n  * OMA DS\n  * OMA IMPS / Wireless Village\n  * OMA LWM2M\n  * OMA PoC\n  * OMA Presence SIMPLE\n  * OMA SE\n  * WAP\n  * WBMP\n  * WBXML\n  * WML\n  * WMLScript\n  * WSP\n  * WTP\n  * XHTML Mobile Profile\n  * MLP\n  * SCOMO\n\n  \n  \n  * v\n  * t\n  * e\n\nDocument markup languages  \n---  \nOffice suite|\n\n  * Compound Document Format\n  * OOXML\n    * SpreadsheetML\n    * PresentationML\n    * WordprocessingML\n  * ODF\n  * UOF\n\n  \nWell-known|\n\n  * HTML\n  * XHTML\n  * MathML\n  * RTF\n  * TeX\n  * LaTeX\n  * Markdown\n\n  \nLesser-known|\n\n  * AmigaGuide\n  * AsciiDoc\n  * BBCode\n  * CML\n  * C-HTML\n  * ConTeXt\n  * CrossMark\n  * DITA\n  * Djot\n  * DocBook\n  * EAD\n  * Enriched text\n  * FHTML\n  * GML\n  * GuideML\n  * HDML\n  * HyTime\n  * IPF\n  * LilyPond\n  * LinuxDoc\n  * Lout\n  * MIF\n  * MAML\n  * MEI\n  * MusicXML\n  * OMDoc\n  * OpenMath\n  * Org-mode\n  * POD\n  * ReStructuredText\n  * RTML\n  * RFT\n  * S1000D\n  * Setext\n  * TEI\n  * Texinfo\n  * troff\n  * Wikitext\n  * WML\n  * WapTV\n  * XAML\n\n  \nList of document markup languages  \n  \nAuthority control databases: National|\n\n  * France\n  * BnF data\n  * Israel\n  * United States\n\n  \n---|---  \n  \nRetrieved from\n\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wireless_Markup_Language&oldid=1205014309\"\n\nCategories:\n\n  * Wireless Application Protocol\n  * Open Mobile Alliance standards\n  * XML markup languages\n\nHidden categories:\n\n  * Articles with short description\n  * Short description matches Wikidata\n  * Articles with BNF identifiers\n  * Articles with BNFdata identifiers\n  * Articles with J9U identifiers\n  * Articles with LCCN identifiers\n\n  * This page was last edited on 8 February 2024, at 16:47 (UTC).\n  * Text is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0; additional terms may apply.
