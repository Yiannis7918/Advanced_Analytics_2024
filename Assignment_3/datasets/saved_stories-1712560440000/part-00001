This\nmissile has a range of 500 km., meaning it could hit all Arab capital cities\naround Israel, and is capable of carrying nuclear and chemical weapons.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Israel reportedly developed the Jericho 2 missile together\nwith South Africa from scratch. It's a two-stage ballistic missile with a\nrange of about 1500 km. Israel carried out several tests with it in the\nMediterranean Sea, with some of them reaching Crete and some falling near an\nAmerican ship north of Benghazi in Libya. The cooperation with South Africa,\nit was alleged by US, also took the form of a joint nuclear test conducted on\nan island south of South Africa in 1979.\n\nAccording to foreign reports, Israel in the late 1990s began to develop a\nthree-stage intercontinental missile with a range of up to 15,500 km, with the\nability to carry several nuclear and thermonuclear warheads with a power\nbetween 800 kilotons to 12 megatons, 650 times the power of the atomic bomb\nthat the United States dropped on Hiroshima.\n\nIranian President Ebrahim Raisi tours the base of the Revolutionary Guards\n(credit: REUTERS)\n\nForeign reports say the missile became operational in 2008. According to a\nsecret report given to the US Congress, the missile gives Israel the\npossibility of causing nuclear damage to all the countries of the Middle East,\nAfrica, Europe, Asia, almost all of North America, and large parts of South\nAmerica and North Oceania. Israel is also reportedly developing the next\ngeneration of the Jericho, the Jericho 4, a three-stage missile, whose\ncapabilities will include the possibility of carrying fragmentation warheads.\n\nAccording to foreign reports, Israel keeps the Jericho missiles at an Air\nForce base near Beit Shemesh. In addition to Israel's nuclear missile carrying\ncapabilities, according to foreign publications, Israel has equipped its\nDolphin series of submarines with a cruise missile called Popeye Turbo SLCM,\nwhich can reach a range of 1,500 km. and carry a nuclear warhead.\n\nWhat is Outbrain\n\nAccording to US intelligence sources, Israel conducted a test in 2000 with\nthis missile in the Indian Ocean. The purpose of the missile is to deliver a\npossible second strike, in case a country decides to attack Israel with a\nnuclear strike. According to foreign publications, each Dolphin submarine has\nfour Popeye Turbo SLCM cruise missiles.\n\nIn addition, according to foreign reports, Israel is developing new missiles\nfor Dolphin submarines that include a vertical launch system. The missiles\nthat will be on the new submarine are ballistic missiles that are launched\nfrom the submarine at the same time as the cruise missiles. This would be a\nserious leap forward for Israeli capabilities in the field of missiles, and it\nseems that this is a new missile with a very long range, perhaps a scaled-down\nversion of the Jericho 3 missile for launching submarines. According to the\nreports, the Dragon submarine has the ability to launch 4-6 such missiles.\n\nHowever, missiles are not the only long-range attack capability that Israel\nhas. Israel also possesses long-range attack capability from aircraft as early\nas the early 1990s, when the Phantom planes arrived in Israel. According to\ndocuments approved for publication by the IDF archives, the IDF built attack\ncapabilities in Libya and Yemen by double refueling between Phantom planes.\n\nThe fighter jets in Israel's hands, the F15, F16, and F35, can reach a range\nof 1,500-2,000 km. round trip without refueling. Israel has Boeing 707 type\nrefueling planes, which make it possible to extend the attack range of the\nplanes and cover the entire area of Iran. Israel also bought new Boeing KC-46\nrefueling planes, which are scheduled to enter service in 2025. Replacing the\nold Boeing 707s, they will significantly upgrade Israel's long-range bombing\ncapabilities.\n\nAdditionally, Israel possesses long-range bunker-busting bombs that can hit\nsome of Iran's nuclear facilities. However, Israel's attack capability is not\nlimited to the nuclear facilities: Israel can damage the institutions and\nsymbols of government in Tehran, damage the fuel terminal on Kharg Island, and\nparalyze Iran's oil export capacity via an attack on the Bandar Abbas port.\nThese injuries will cause the collapse of the Iranian economy and disrupt the\nability to live in Iran.\n\nIsrael has anti-missile defense capabilities, and a complete series of air-\ndefense missiles, including the Iron Dome, David's Slingshot, Arrow 2, and\nArrow 3, which allow Israel to neutralize a large part of the missile, drone,\nand rocket attack capabilities of Iran, Hezbollah, and the Houthis in Yemen,\nas has been proven in six months.\n\nAlthough not all the missiles will be stopped by the aforementioned systems,\ntheir damage will be less than any of the threats we hear every day in the\nmedia, and the damage Israel will cause to those countries is tens of times\ngreater than their ability to harm Israel.\n\nWhat is Outbrain\n\nRevolutionary Guards (credit: REUTERS/CAREN FIROUZ)\n\nIsrael has the ability to hit any target in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, or Yemen,\nthrough thousands of sorties of bombs from fighter jets. This capability could\ndo unprecedented damage to these countries, including damage to fuel\nterminals, bridges, vital infrastructure, and symbols of government such as\nthe presidential palace in Damascus. It is important that those who threaten\nIsrael recognize and understand Israel's attack and defense capabilities\nagainst missiles so that they understand what they are dealing with and the\nconsequences of their actions.\n\nRelated TagsIDFIranIraqLebanonIron DomeArrow-3missiles\n\nTake Israel home with the new Jerusalem Post Store\n\nShop now >>\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\nWhat is Outbrain\n\nWhat is Outbrain\n\nHot Opinion\n\n### A grim fate and raw wounds\n\nBy JPOST EDITORIAL\n\n### Following failure in withholding Hamas, now is Doha's chance to rebrand\n\nBy OHAD MERLIN\n\n### The psychology of soldiers and accidents in the Hamas war\n\nBy RENEE GARFINKEL\n\n### Yellow nail polish: Remembering the Gaza hostages and Hamas's victims\n\nBy BARBARA SOFER\n\n### Memories: A 10-minute conversation with former Israeli Prime Minister\nMenachem Begin\n\nBy DVORA WAYSMANMost Read\n\n1\n\n### Strategic blow: Alleged Israeli airstrike takes out Iranian general in\nDamascus\n\n2\n\n### 'Preparing strikes on Israeli embassies': The coming Iranian response to\nSyria strike\n\n3\n\n### This is everything we know so far about Kate Middleton's cancer\n\n4\n\n### Donald Trump: 'If I don't get elected, it's going to be a bloodbath for\nthe country!'\n\n5\n\n### Russian warships enter the Red Sea, navy says\n\nInformationAbout UsContact usFeedbackTerms Of ServicePrivacy PolicySubscriber\nAgreementJPost JobsCancel SubscriptionSitemap\u05e4\u05e8\u05e1\u05d5\u05dd \u05d1\u05d2'\u05e8\u05d5\u05d6\u05dc\u05dd \u05e4\u05d5\u05e1\u05d8Customer\nServiceAdvertise with UsThe Jerusalem Post GroupBreaking NewsWorld NewsIran\nNewsIvritTalk- Free trial lessonThe Jerusalem ReportJerusalem Post Lite\u05d7\u05d3\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea\n\u05de\u05e2\u05e8\u05d9\u05d1Real Estate ListingsHypeSpecial ContentAdvisor50 JewsJP\nStoreBrandBlendTools and servicesJPost PremiumUlpan OnlineJPost NewsletterOur\nMagazinesLearn HebrewRSS feedJPost.com ArchiveDigital LibraryLists of Jewish\nholidaysLaw\u05dc\u05d5\u05d7 \u05d7\u05d2\u05d9\u05dd \u05d5\u05de\u05d5\u05e2\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd 2023\u05d6\u05de\u05e0\u05d9 \u05db\u05e0\u05d9\u05e1\u05ea \u05e9\u05d1\u05eaSites Of InterestPoalim\nOnlineJNF-USAWho is HamasThe Jerusalem Post Customer Service Center can be\ncontacted with any questions or requests: Telephone: *2421 * Extension 4\nJerusalem Post or 03-7619056 Fax: 03-5613699 E-mail: subs@jpost.com The center\nis staffed and provides answers on Sundays through Thursdays between 07:00 AM\nand 14:00 PM and Fridays only handles distribution requests between 7:00 AM\nand 12:30 PM For international customers: The center is staffed and provides\nanswers on Sundays through Thursdays between 7AM and 14PM Israel time Toll\nFree number 1-800-448-9291 Telephone +972-3-761-9056 Fax: 972-3-561-3699\nE-mail: subs@jpost.comCopyright \u00a9 2024 Jpost Inc.
