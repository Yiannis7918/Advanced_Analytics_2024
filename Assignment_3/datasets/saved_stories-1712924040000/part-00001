In every issue, I cover topics related to Big Tech and startups\nthrough the lens of engineering managers and senior engineers. In this\narticle, we cover one out of four topics from today\u2019s subscriber-only The\nPulse issue. To get full issues twice a week, subscribe here.\n\nSella is a mid-sized bank in Italy with around $14B in assets under\nmanagement. However, Since Sunday (7 April), most of its services are\ninaccessible. The Sella banking app, the Sella Invest app, and internet\nbanking are all down. Two trading apps \u2013 Sella XTrading and Sella Trader,\ncontinue to operate normally. So, it seems all the banks\u2019 digital properties,\nexcept those for trading, have gone down hard.\n\n\u201cSomething, something Oracle.\u201d What caused this issue? From Sella\u2019s status\npage:\n\n> \u201cFollowing the installation of an update to the operating system and related\n> firmware which led to an unstable situation. Our technicians have been\n> collaborating with Oracle, a multinational and supplier of the Sella group's\n> operating system for over twenty years, to restore full operations: several\n> progresses have been made but at the time we are writing to you the\n> situation has not yet returned to normal.\n>\n> This type of intervention takes time, which is why the activities carried\n> out so far have not completely solved the problem.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to get too much out of these vague reports, but here\u2019s my attempt at\ndecrypting what might have happened:\n\n  * An Oracle version was updated, and/or database schema changes were made. There\u2019s a much smaller possiblity that both happened at the same time.\n  * The changes messed up all major databases in some unexpected way.\n  * Sella needs Oracle\u2019s help to figure things out. It\u2019s suggested that the problem was probably some edge case in how they use Oracle, or how they define schemas, or a widely-used Oracle feature might have been changed, etc.\n\nYou might expect something catastrophic like this to happen if Sella was\ntrying to \u201cjump ahead\u201d by updating to several versions of Oracle from a very\nold version. After all, if it was \u201cjust\u201d a schema change: this change should\nbe straightforward enough to revert.\n\nStill, I\u2019m puzzled by how long the system has been down. If it was a risky\nupdate, just restore the backups! Every sensible tech company has a backup\nstrategy to bring back its systems \u2013 and performing a backup before a major\nupdate is common practice. If you perform a risky update, this is a good\nreminder to start by doing a backup, or inserting a \u201crollback point\u201d that you\ncan revert to, should things go wrong.\n\nIf it was an update to Oracle, or to the operating system, then why not roll\nback the update? This is also why banks utilize a 2-day \u201cblackout period\u201d\nwhich creates space to revert failed migrations or updates. Of course, if it\nwas that simple, then Sella would surely have already done the change. It all\nsuggests there was an unexpected edge case.\n\nThe problem might be caused by an external \u2014 but kind of internal \u2014 platform\nowned by the banking group. Fabrick is a platform that Stella is operating on\ntop of. This platform was created in 2018 by the Stella group, and is a\nplatform that supports open banking and open payment services. The platform is\nused by clients outside of the Stella group as well. What confirms the\nsuspicion that this is a Fabick-level issue is Fabrick\u2019s status page that says\nFabrick\u2019s tech staff are involved:\n\n> \u201cWe would like to inform you that the event is currently still ongoing,\n> continuous monitoring is in place, and any slowdowns are affecting only the\n> services provided jointly with the Sella group. There are still ongoing\n> slowdowns in bank transfers, payments with debit and prepaid cards and in\n> accessing and using online services, including Internet Banking, Smart\n> Business Sella and apps. The resolution of the event has top priority for\n> all of us. (...)\n>\n> These events occurred after the installation of an update to the Sella\n> group's IT systems, which led to an instability affecting Fabrick's recalled\n> services.\u201d\n\nWe can already see a problem: a web of dependencies. So far, Stella mentioned\na problem with Oracle. The platform they use \u2014 Fabrick \u2014 says theere\u2019s an\n\u201cinstability\u201d caused by the update to Stella\u2019s own systems. So who is at fault\nhere?\n\nWould have this issue occurred if Stella owned its own platform, instead of\ncreating a platform that they spin off, and now something falls through the\ncracks? This might well have happened: but at least it would have been easier\nto identify the issue.\n\nA software engineer I talked with with visiblity into the issue shared that\nthe engineering team is grappling with tech debt built up, which is making it\nhard to identify and fix the issue. This engineer speculated that the common\npractice of subcontracting several layers within banks could also lead to the\nsituation that it becomes an \u201cit\u2019s not my problem\u201d situation \u2014 which is what\nwe see, as the Fabrick platform seems to blame the \u201cupdate to Stella group\u2019s\nIT systems\u201d which caused Fabrick instability. But Fabrick is \u2014 or should be \u2014\nStella group as well!Are 2-day \u201cblackout\u201d windows good for an engineering\nculture? Banks regularly do maintenance during weekends; it\u2019s when data\nmigration projects are run, and things like schema updates, rolling out of new\nsystems, and other riskier changes.\n\nIn some ways, banks are lucky to have these \u201cblackout periods\u201d when money\nmovements are frozen, and engineering teams have up to 48 hours to make\nchanges, test them, and roll them back if needed. In contrast, most other\nindustries like ecommerce, utilities, airlines, etc, have no such luxury and\nmust invest in zero-downtime migrations. This means these companies need to\nget very good at detecting and resolving incidents in real time. Banks rarely\ndo!\n\nSo, it\u2019s fair to ask if it is a net good or a net bad that banks don\u2019t need to\nplan for short downtime, or zero downtime maintenance or migration? I\u2019d argue\nthis approach unintentionally helps create a weaker engineering culture, and a\nworse work-life balance. Banks can simply have engineers work at weekends on\nrisky migrations. They don\u2019t need to do rollback plans, because they already\nhave one: \u201cif it goes wrong on Saturday, we have another 24 hours to fix it on\nSunday.\u201d\n\nGood luck to the Sella and Fabrick teams in resolving this outage. Perhaps\nwe\u2019ll learn what caused this serious incident.\n\nAs related reading, here are past articles touching on the topic of migrations\nand tricky outages:\n\n  * Why it took Roblox 73 hours to get their systems back online in 2021. An interesting deepdive, and details on why it took so long to find the root cause of the outage.\n  * Migrations done well: a guide for executing migrations well, at both small and large scales.\n\nUpdate on 11 April: clarified that Fabrick is, in fact, owned by Stella group.\n\nThis was one out of the five topics covered in this week\u2019s The Pulse. The full\nedition additionally covers:\n\n  1. Industry pulse. The first mass layoffs at Apple since 1997 (or not?); amateurish URL rewrite at X (formerly Twitter); never-ending job interviews for engineering executives, and more.\n  2. The end of Hopin. It took Hopin just two years to become the fastest-ever growing European startup by valuation. Four years later, the company is no more. The final valuable parts of Hopin are being sold, and all staff are expected to be let go. Exclusive details on the StreamYard sale.\n  3. Adyen, the only major Fintech with zero mass layoffs? All major Fintech startups have let go of some staff over the past two years, except Adyen. Meanwhile, the business has quietly become one of Stripe\u2019s biggest competitors. A close look at this curious phenomenon.\n\nRead the full The Pulse here.\n\n### Featured Pragmatic Engineer Jobs\n\n  * Director of Engineering at Synthesia. \u00a3180-250K.
