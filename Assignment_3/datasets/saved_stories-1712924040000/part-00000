In Melbourne, they email the trees. This\nbecame possible thanks to a decision to map every tree in the city and give it\na unique ID number.\n\n\"Dearest Golden Elm\", wrote one correspondent earlier this month, \"I finally\nfound you! I see you every day on my way to uni, but I had no idea of what\nkind of tree you are. You are the most beautiful tree in the city and I love\nyou.\"\n\nAbout 3,000 emails have been sent to individual trees in the last two years.\nThis didn't start out as an exercise in sentiment, but a hard-headed attempt\nby Melbourne city council to manage an urban forest in decline - as a result\nof drought, by 2009 40% of the 77,000 trees in Australia's \"garden city\" were\nstruggling or dying.\n\n\"Many of these trees were in a severe state of decline and we were staring\ndown the barrel of losing up to 50% of our beautiful tree population. That\nwould have fundamentally changed the way that Melbourne looked, the way it\nperformed environmentally, the way people felt about it socially and even\neconomically as well,\" says councillor Arron Wood, who leads on the\nenvironment.\n\n\"So what we did is we actually mapped all the trees in the city... In doing so\nwe had to assign each of them an individual tree ID and it was a logical step\nthen to allow our residents to actually interact on a digital platform. And\nthey could email whether a tree was dropping limbs or if it was in a severe\nstate of decline and we could easily locate that tree and come out and\nintervene.\"\n\nImage source, Other\n\nIt was then that something extraordinary happened. Instead of identifying a\ntree in need of attention and emailing the council to get it done, people in\nMelbourne began sending personal messages to the trees.\n\n\"As I was leaving St Mary's College today I was struck , not by a branch, but\nby your radiant beauty. You must get these messages all the time. You're such\nan attractive tree,\" reads one profession of love - and according to Wood it\nis quite typical.\n\n\"People literally are talking to these trees as if they are people, telling\nthem how much they love them, thanking them for protecting them against the\nsun, apologising when their dog pees on them in the morning,\" he says.\n\n\"So there are some quite humorous ones but also some really heartfelt emails\nas well.\"\n\nThere have been emails from former residents living in Germany and the United\nStates, telling the trees how much they miss them. English elms have been\nasked for their views on the Ashes series.\n\nSoon, there could be a lot more emails. The council believes planting\nadditional trees could bring down Melbourne's sizzling summer temperatures by\nfour degrees Celsius.\n\nAs well as cooling its citizens, planting 3,000 new trees a year will help the\ncity to breathe more easily. Individual trees have received emails thanking\nthem for extracting carbon dioxide from the air.\n\nImage source, Thinkstock\n\nMy favourite email was sent to tree number 1022165 at the end of May of this\nyear:\n\n\"Dear Green Leaf Elm, I hope you like living at St Mary's. Most of the time I\nlike it too. I have exams coming up and I should be busy studying. You do not\nhave exams because you are a tree. I don't think there is much more to talk\nabout as we don't have a lot in common, you being a tree and such. But I'm\nglad we're in this together.\"\n\nIn 1975, the singer Don Estelle, advised \"whispering grass don't tell the\ntrees, because the trees don't need to know\". Well, maybe they do.\n\n## Selected treemail (July 2015)\n\nWeeping Myrtle, Tree ID 1494392\n\n5 July 2015\n\nHello Weeping Myrtle,\n\nI'm sitting inside near you and I noticed on the urban tree map you don't have\nmany friends nearby. I think that's sad so I want you to know I'm thinking of\nyou. I also want to thank you for providing oxygen for us to breath in the\nhustle and bustle of the city.\n\nBest Regards, N\n\nGum, Tree ID 1032002\n\n11 July 2015\n\nDear Gum,\n\nApologies if that's not the form of address you prefer. I wanted very much to\ntell you how much I miss your family. I've lived in Texas for two and a half\nyears now, and I so fervently miss the heady scent of your cologne as the\nmorning sun warms you.\n\nI miss your gentle swish swish as the wind tousles your leaves playfully. I\nmiss your strong white trunk, rising majestically from the earth, striking up\ntowards the clouds. I miss the dappled shade you so generously provide.\n\nThe sound of magpies, harbouring in your foliage, does not grace my ears. The\nsilver green of your long, lithe leaves does not appear in my current\nsurrounds.\n\nI miss you, Gum. I miss all that you represent for me. Stand tall and strong,\nand know that my heart reaches out to you across the seas.\n\nWith immense fondness, A\n\nGolden Elm Tree ID 1040779\n\n11 July 2015\n\nDearest Golden Elm Tree, I finally found you! As in I see you everyday on my\nway to uni, but I had no idea of what kind of tree you are. You are the most\nbeautiful tree in the city and I love you ^_^ It always makes me so happy to\nsee you standing there minding your own business. I have to say, you have the\nmost beautiful canopy and I love how the light green leaves on your branches\ncontrast with the darkness of your trunk. We really should have more trees of\nyour kind in our city.\n\nStay awesome.\n\nHugs! A\n\nVariegated Elm, Tree ID 1033102\n\n13 July 2015\n\nDear Elm, I was delighted to find you alive and flourishing, because a lot of\nyour family used to live in the UK, but they all caught a terrible infection\nand died. Do be very careful, and if you notice any unfamiliar insects e-mail\nan arboriculturist at once. I miss your characteristic silhouettes and\nbeautifully shaped branches - used to be one of the glories of the English\nlandscape - more than I can say. Melbourne must be a beautiful city.\n\nSincere good wishes, D\n\nEnglish Elm, Tree ID 1032245\n\n14 July 2015\n\nAre you and your fellow English Elms enjoying the Ashes series as much as we\nin England are, and are you giving the native Aussie trees some stick over\ntheir team's performance?\n\nC\n\n[Note: Two days after this email was sent, Australia ended the first day of\nthe second Ashes test on 337-1- \"the most one-sided day of Test cricket you\ncould ever see\", as the BBC's Stephan Shemilt put it.]\n\nBrush Box, Tree ID 1039919\n\n14 July 2015\n\nHello, dear Tree. I read about this wonderful project and suppose to write you\nfrom another side of Earth - Russia. I hope you have a good care and don't\nsick. One day we will meet, may be.\n\nYours truly, R\n\nImage source, ALAMY\n\nCouncillor Arron Wood speaks to Shaun Ley on The World Tonight at 2200 BST on\nBBC Radio Four tonight.
