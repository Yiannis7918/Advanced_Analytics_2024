In\na 2023 Gallup poll, only 36 percent of Americans expressed confidence in\nhigher education, down from 57 percent in 2015. Among Republicans, confidence\nhas dropped 20 percentage points since 2018, to only 19 percent. A majority of\nAmericans now believe that higher education is unaffordable, not worth the\ncost, even for those who can afford it, and headed in the wrong direction.\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans cite high tuition as a major reason for\ncriticizing higher education. Republicans also emphasize politicized\ninstruction, lack of marketable skills training, and excessive efforts to\nshield students from views they might find offensive. And that was before\nHamas launched its October 7 terrorist attack on Israel and the conflict over\nfree speech and campus antisemitism that followed.\n\nThe picture, however, is more complicated than the headlines suggest.\nNotwithstanding public skepticism, a recent Chronicle of Higher Education poll\nfound that \u201c78 percent of respondents would recommend that a close friend or\nrelative pursue a bachelor\u2019s degree,\u201d though many respondents \u201cqualified\u201d\ntheir recommendation to say friends should \u201cchoose a course of study that\nwarrants the time and money involved.\u201d That said, less than one third of\nrespondents think colleges and universities do a good job of \u201cleveling the\nplaying field for success in society.\u201d Given a choice of five alternatives to\ncollege, ranging from trade school to apprenticeships to military service,\nlarge majorities \u201csaid each one was about the same as or better than a\nbachelor\u2019s degree in trying to achieve a successful livelihood.\u201d\n\nMost Popular\n\n#### Traction for the three-year bachelor\u2019s degree\n\n#### In sudden move, Harvard, Caltech return to test requirements\n\n#### National protest day planned against \u201cattacks\u201d on higher ed\n\n#### UNC System\u2019s roadmap of college credit for military experience\n\n#### Plan to close college prison program prompts \u201cheartbreak\u201d\n\n#### Berkeley professor admits that she is white, not Native American\n\n#### Why we should rethink performance-based funding (opinion)\n\n#### OCR: Hinds CC failed to support pregnant student\n\n#### Should instructors disclose their own use of AI in teaching? (opinion)\n\nUntil recently, most Americans believed college was a good investment. Study\nafter study demonstrated that college graduates earn substantially more than\nworkers without a college degree. According to one widely cited report,\ncollege graduates on average earn 84 percent more over their lifetimes than\nthose with just a high school degree.\n\nBetween 1965 and 2011, undergraduate enrollment almost quadrupled \u201cas the\nearning differential between high school and college graduates expanded.\u201d But\nas the cost escalated and student debt levels reached record highs, doubts\ngrew: between 2010 and 2021, undergraduate enrollment fell 15 percent from\n18.1 million to 15.4 million students, although this year the number of\ncollege applicants is up 6 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, new studies offered empirical support for doubters. Acknowledging\nthat the earnings differential remains high, these studies examined the\ncollege wealth premium\u2014the extent to which college degree holders accumulate\ngreater total assets than high school graduates over their lifetimes The\nresults were mixed. Older, white college graduates born before 1980\naccumulated two to three times as much wealth as their non-college\u2013educated\nwhite peers, but for more recent graduates, especially Black and Hispanic\ngraduates, the wealth premium was much smaller and for some cohorts\nnegligible.\n\nIn the aggregate, \u201cmore education still means more income,\u201d but for many\nstudents, the \u201cdownside risk[s]\u201d are large, and outcomes vary widely depending\non family background, access to financial aid, race and other factors.\n\nIn Is College Worth It? Class and the Myth of the College Premium, forthcoming\nthis month from Johns Hopkins University Press, Richard Ohmann, emeritus\nprofessor of English at Wesleyan University (now deceased), and Ira Shor,\nemeritus professor of English and urban education at City University of New\nYork, argue that the college wage premium is largely a myth that serves\nbusiness interests and reinforces class hierarchies. Doing little to promote\nsocial mobility, colleges instead have \u201cassumed a key role in reproducing\ninequality.\u201d\n\nThe authors acknowledge that the higher lifetime earnings of college graduates\nis among the best documented findings in the social sciences, but ask, \u201cwhat\nis it, precisely, about college that pays off?\u201d And for whom?\n\nOhmann and Shor argue strenuously that higher education is correlated with but\ndoes not \u201ccause\u201d higher earnings. They list a plethora of factors that might\nbe associated with the population that chooses to go to college and may\ninfluence earnings in ways unrelated to whatever an undergraduate learns,\nincluding race, gender, physical attributes, intelligence, ambition and family\nwealth. Thus, for example, \u201cfamily wealth could be a predictor of going to\ncollege, and college a predictor of high earnings, but since family wealth\ndirectly predicts high earnings, we can forget about college.\u201d\n\nFamily of origin, then, is critical in what makes people well off; affluent\nfamilies can pass wealth to the next generation and provide their children a\nboatload of advantages.\n\nFocusing only on an undifferentiated college premium \u201ccommits the fallacy of\ndivision: that what is true of a group is true of each individual in it.\u201d It\nignores large disparities in earnings by major and institutional type. The\ngraduates of highly selective institutions fare much better than other\nundergraduate degree holders. Most important, the qualities students bring\nwith them to college matter more than what they learn there. In short, the\nauthors \u201csee the idea that \u2018college\u2019 leads to high earnings as only one factor\nin a complex bundle of causes, most of which are not features of a college\neducation.\u201d\n\n#### Editors\u2019 Picks\n\n  * \u2018Game-Changing Crisis\u2019: Lawmakers, Experts Vent FAFSA Frustrations\n  * Degrees Earned Fall Again, Certificates Rise\n  * Study: Nearly 40 Percent of Students Started, Never Finished College\n\nOhmann and Shor acknowledge that colleges may help students develop\n\u201cgeneralized capabilities\u201d that make them more productive workers, such as\nliteracy, numeracy, critical thinking, communication and problem solving, but\nsuggest college is, at best, a \u201cwasteful and oblique way\u201d to acquire such\nskills. They also acknowledge that a college degree may serve a signaling\nfunction, letting employers know a job candidate has certain intellectual and\ncharacter attributes and the tenacity to complete a degree. But these\npossibilities say little about how much college itself contributes to higher\nearnings.\n\nMost higher education economists, it\u2019s worth noting, agree with Ohmann and\nShor that not all graduates benefit from a college wage premium and that\ngender, race, and wealth (and the social and cultural capital that come with\nit) play a major role in determining outcomes.\n\nWhat sets Is College Worth It? apart, then, is the authors\u2019 claim that the\ncollege wage premium is attributable \u201cchiefly to the necessities of capitalist\naccumulation, to the preferences and needs of employers, to systems of\ndomination (e.g., class, race, gender, able-bodiedness), and to the dynamics\nof social reproduction\u2014that is, the maintenance and adjustment of those\nprocesses [and] systems.\u201d In short, the \u201cpremium privileges the already\nprivileged, recapitulating historical inequities\u201d and preserving \u201cprevailing\nhierarchies.\u201d\n\nThe authors believe that in a capitalist, market-driven economy, \u201chigher\neducation has been moving steadily in a corporate direction,\u201d increasingly\nfocused on return on investment, turning colleges \u201cinto training and marketing\ncenters for business,\u201d and \u201creproducing rather than dispelling inequality.\u201d\n\nThis framing prevents Ohmann and Shor from offering much in the way of\npossible reforms that would render colleges and universities\u2014or American\nsociety\u2014more equitable.\n\nAnd so, in a concluding chapter, Shor indicates that meaningful reform would\nrequire \u201corganized opposition\u201d to \u201cthe institutional forces and ideologies\nsustaining inequality\u2014male domination, white privilege, corporate hegemony,\nheteronormativity, and imperialism\u2014as the foundational pillars of the status\nquo.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Shor offers a reform agenda, similar to the agenda advocated\nby other educational progressives, including free tuition at public\ninstitutions; student debt relief; \u201chigh levels of state subsidies for public\ncolleges in order to ... make mass higher education a rich experience,\u201d with\nsmall classes and interactive and student-centered pedagogy; the folding of\ncommunity colleges into four-year institutions; continuous, seven-day-a-week\noperation of classes to benefit working families; and greater support for\nmembers of vulnerable groups.\n\nNone of these policies, Shor recognizes, seem likely to be enacted any time\nsoon.\n\nSo, is college worth it? Ironically, the authors seem to think so. As they\nacknowledge in passing, \u201ceducation is intellectually, socially, and\nemotionally valuable, apart from any wage premium it may bring about.\u201d With\nthat important and, these days, all too often ignored assessment, we\nwholeheartedly agree.\n\nDavid Wippman is the president of Hamilton College.
