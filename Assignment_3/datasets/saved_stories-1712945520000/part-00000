The discovery of the\nbrightest gamma-ray burst (GRB) to date, GRB 221009A, presented an opportunity\nto spectroscopically test the idea that r-process elements are produced\nfollowing the collapse of rapidly rotating massive stars. Here we present\nJames Webb Space Telescope observations of GRB 221009A obtained +168 and +170\nrest-frame days after the gamma-ray trigger, and demonstrate that they are\nwell described by a SN 1998bw-like supernova (SN) and power-law afterglow,\nwith no evidence for a component from r-process emission. The SN, with a\nnickel mass of approximately 0.09 M_\u2299, is only slightly fainter than the\nbrightness of SN 1998bw at this phase, which indicates that the SN is not an\nunusual GRB-SN. This demonstrates that the GRB and SN mechanisms are decoupled\nand that highly energetic GRBs are not likely to produce significant\nquantities of r-process material, which leaves open the question of whether\nexplosions of massive stars are key sources of r-process elements. Moreover,\nthe host galaxy of GRB 221009A has a very low metallicity of approximately\n0.12 Z_\u2299 and strong H_2 emission at the explosion site, which is consistent\nwith recent star formation, hinting that environmental factors are responsible\nfor its extreme energetics.\n\n## Main\n\nThe origin of the heaviest elements in the Universe, specifically those formed\nby means of rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis, remains a major\nopen question in astrophysics^1,2. Given the high density of neutron-rich\nmaterial needed for the r-process to occur, the collisions of neutron stars\nhave long been a suspected source^3,4 and, indeed, the observations of the\nkilonova associated with GW 170817 confirmed that binary neutron star (BNS)\nmergers are the source of at least some of the r-process material in the\nUniverse^5,6,7,8,9. However, there is growing evidence that there may be\nmultiple sites of r-process nucleosynthesis from studies of low-metallicity\ngalactic halo stars, dwarf galaxy and globular cluster\nenrichment^10,11,12,13,14.\n\nA second proposed site of the r-process is in rapidly rotating cores of\nmassive stars that collapse into an accreting black hole, producing similar\nconditions as the aftermath of a BNS merger^15. Theoretical simulations\nsuggest that accretion disk outflows in these so-called \u2018collapsars\u2019 may reach\nthe neutron-rich state required for the r-process to occur^15,16. The larger\nmass of r-process material synthesized per event compared with BNS mergers\nsuggests that collapsars could be a dominant source, making them a possible\nmissing piece in our understanding of r-process enrichment in the Universe.\n\nThe discovery of the long-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) GRB 221009A, the\nbrightest GRB ever observed^17,18,19, on 9 October 2022 at a relatively nearby\nredshift of z = 0.151 (ref. ^20) presents a unique opportunity to search for\nr-process signatures in a collapsar. Collapsars are the favoured explanation\nfor long GRBs (LGRBs), which result from the launch of a relativistic jet and\nits subsequent interaction with the surrounding medium^21,22,23. r-Process\nnucleosynthesis is more likely to occur in collapsars with large accretion\ndisk masses, which are also thought to be linked with brighter GRBs^15, making\nGRB 221009A a particularly strong candidate to search for r-process\nsignatures. These events are known to be accompanied by broad-lined type Ic\nsupernovae (SNe Ic-BL) characterized by higher velocities than normal type Ic\nsupernovae, suggesting that the energy powering LGRBs also affects the\nassociated supernovae (see ref. ^24 for a review).\n\nIt is the supernova (SN) following a LGRB that would be responsible for\ncarrying r-process material from the explosion site into the interstellar\nmedium. Although early-time observations of GRB 221009A provided an exquisite\nview of the afterglow^25,26,27, to date, there are conflicting claims in the\nliterature regarding the presence of an associated SN, which are due, in part,\nto the bright afterglow and high Milky Way extinction^28,29,30,31. Moreover,\nthere have been claims that two recent LGRBs are associated with BNS\nmergers^32,33,34,35, making the search for an SN associated with GRB 221009A\ncrucial not only for an r-process search, but also for understanding the\norigin of its extreme luminosity.\n\nHere, we present late-time James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of\nGRB 221009A consisting of a near-infrared (NIR) spectrum and imaging in four\nNIR bands. These observations provide clear detection of an SN associated with\nthis extreme event and enable the search for r-process emission in a nebular-\nphase spectrum of a GRB-SN. Moreover, these data provide a detailed NIR view\nof the host galaxy, enabling an assessment of environmental factors that may\nbe responsible for this extraordinary GRB.\n\n## Identification of SN emission\n\nWe obtained spectroscopy with the Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) using\nthe medium-resolution gratings covering 1\u20133 \u03bcm on 20 April 2023 and imaging\nwith the Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) using the F115W, F200W, F277W and F444W\nfilters on 22 April 2023. These observations occurred +194 and +196 observer-\nframe days after the burst (rest-frame phases of +168 and +170 days,\nrespectively). The afterglow of GRB 221009A is clearly detected in our images,\nfrom which we measured photometry (Fig. 1; see Methods for details). In our\nNIRSpec observations, we detect a clear spectral trace containing flux from\nGRB 221009A and its host galaxy (Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2; see Methods for\ndetails of the spectral extraction). Owing to the high Milky Way extinction^36\nand possible non-negligible extinction intrinsic to the host galaxy^19,20,31,\nwe analysed archival early-phase NIRSpec/PRISM and Mid-Infrared Instrument\n(MIRI) spectra^31 of GRB 221009A using multiple dust laws to constrain the\nextinction (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 3). We used the resulting\nextinction parameters (Extended Data Table 1) to correct our rest frame +168\nday NIRSpec grating spectrum.\n\nFig. 1: JWST/NIRCam imaging.\n\nOur images of GRB 221009A (top row), best-fit GALFIT galaxy models (middle\nrow) and GALFIT model subtracted images (bottom row). Images are shown with\nnorth up and east to the left. A clear point source is detected at the\nlocation of GRB 221009A. The red rectangle shows the NIRSpec slit orientation.\nPSF photometry of GRB 221009A was performed on the galaxy-subtracted images.\nThe host galaxy is well described by a single S\u00e9rsic component, although some\nresidual galaxy structure remains in the F200W, F277W and F444W filters.\n\nFull size image\n\nIn Fig. 2, we show two versions of the spectrum, one corrected using an\nextinction curve from ref. ^37 and another using one from ref. ^38,\ntransformed to the rest frame of GRB 221009A. In both cases, the spectrum\nexhibits an overall flat shape in the range ~1\u20131.5 \u03bcm, with a smooth, gradual\nupturn at redder wavelengths extending to the edge of our coverage at ~2.7 \u03bcm\nand a sharp upturn at bluer wavelengths due, in part, to apparent broad\nemission features. The use of different extinction laws and parameters, within\nthe range of uncertainties from our fitting, does not change these fundamental\ncharacteristics.\n\nFig. 2: JWST/NIRSpec spectrum.\n\nOur +168 rest-frame phase JWST/NIRSpec G140M+G235M spectrum of GRB 221009A\ncorrected for extinction (see Methods for spectral extraction details; error\nspectra are shown in Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2). We show two versions\ncorrected using the G23 (orange)^38 and F99 (blue)^37 extinction laws and\ncorresponding best-fit extinction parameters from fitting the early-time\nNIRSpec/PRISM and MIRI data from ref. ^31 as described in Methods \u2018Constraints\non foreground dust from early-time spectroscopy\u2019. In both cases, the spectrum\nappears to exhibit multiple components, with SN-like emission at \u03bb \u2272 1.5 \u03bcm\nand rising flux at \u03bb \u2273 1.5 \u03bcm, which is likely to be due to the GRB afterglow\npower law. We also show our JWST/NIRCam photometry corrected using the F99\nextinction law^37 (points with 1\u03c3 error bars), as well as the ALMA-XRT power\nlaw (black line).\n\nFull size image\n\nThe gradual rise in the spectrum at wavelengths \u03bb \u2273 1.5 \u03bcm strongly resembles\na power-law shape and therefore this region is likely to contain a significant\ncontribution from the afterglow of GRB 221009A. In addition, our photometric\nobservation in the F444W filter (which lies redward of our spectroscopic\ncoverage) indicates that the flux continues to rise at longer wavelengths\n(\u22733.8 \u03bcm, rest frame). The fluxes measured in the F200W, F277W and F444W\nfilters are consistent with a single power law with an index of \u03b2 = \u22120.64 \u00b1\n0.10. The shape of the NIRSpec spectrum at wavelengths \u03bb \u2273 1.5 \u03bcm is slightly\nsteeper than this slope, with a power-law index of \u03b2 = \u22120.76 \u00b1 0.07, although\nit is consistent within the uncertainties.\n\nAt \u03bb \u2272 1.5 \u03bcm, the spectrum clearly deviates from an extrapolation of the\npower law at \u03bb \u2273 1.5 \u03bcm, exhibiting an overall flat shape and several broad\nSN-like emission features. Indeed, we identify two broad emission features\nlocated at wavelengths of ~0.86 \u03bcm and ~0.92 \u03bcm, which are consistent with the\nCa ii NIR triplet and O i, respectively. These are typical nebular-phase\nemission lines observed in core-collapse supernovae (for example, ref. ^39).\nWe show a zoomed-in comparison of these features with those seen in SN 1998bw,\nSN 2013ge and SN 2014ad in Extended Data Fig. 4. In addition to the flat\nspectral shape at ~1\u20131.5 \u03bcm, these emission features strongly support the\nidentification of SN emission in our spectrum of GRB 221009A. Our observation,\ntherefore, represents the latest phase NIR spectrum of an SN associated with a\nGRB to date.\n\n### Isolating the SN signal\n\nAlthough disentangling the SN and afterglow components is not straightforward,\nthe relative featureless nature of the red end of the spectrum indicates that\nthe afterglow component is sufficiently bright to not only affect the overall\nshape but also to dilute SN features with respect to the continuum in that\nregion (see Methods and Extended Data Fig. 5 for comparisons with previous\nsupernovae).\n\nTo separate the afterglow and SN components, we considered several afterglow\nmodels. First, we used Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and\nSwift X-ray Telescope (Swift/XRT) observations obtained at roughly the same\nphase as our NIRSpec spectrum and modelled the afterglow at NIR wavelengths as\na power law connecting the radio and X-ray data. We find flux density F_\u03bd \u221d\n\u03bd^\u22120.63 \u00b1 0.03 for frequency \u03bd (see Methods for details). We show this power\nlaw, normalized to the measured radio and X-ray flux, compared with our\nspectrum in Fig. 2. While the ALMA-XRT power-law slope is similar to the shape\nof our spectrum at \u03bb \u2273 1.5 \u03bcm, our data is systematically offset to higher\nflux, which indicates that the ALMA-XRT power law does not fully capture the\nafterglow contribution at NIR wavelengths. Moreover, the implied SN component\ndeviates from the expected spectral shape of an SN (Methods and Extended Data\nFig. 5).\n\nNext, we modelled the afterglow from our spectrum itself, namely, as a power\nlaw with a slope determined by fitting our spectrum at wavelengths \u03bb \u2273 1.5 \u03bcm,\nwhere the afterglow is likely to be dominating. We find a best-fit power law\nof F_\u03bd \u221d \u03bd^\u22120.76 \u00b1 0.07. This is steeper than the ALMA-XRT power law, which\nfurther confirms that interpolating the millimetre and X-ray bands is not\nlikely to provide the best representation of the afterglow at these\nwavelengths. We then performed a joint fit of an SN template and the fitted\npower law, with the power-law slope fixed, to determine the best-fit\ncombination of SN and afterglow. For the SN template, we used the +51 day\nspectrum of SN 1998bw as this is the latest available NIR spectrum of another\nGRB-SN^40, allowing the overall flux normalization to vary.\n\nIn Fig. 3, we present the best-fit SN 1998bw + afterglow spectrum and our\nspectrum of GRB 221009A after subtracting the best-fit afterglow component. We\ncompare our afterglow-subtracted spectrum with the SN 1998bw spectrum scaled\nto the distance of GRB 221009A and the brightness of SN 1998bw at the phase of\nour JWST spectrum using the light curve of SN 1998bw from ref. ^41. The best-\nfit SN component is ~30% fainter than the expected brightness SN 1998bw would\nhave at this distance and phase. We also compare with late-time spectra of the\nSN Ic SN 2013ge^42 and the SN Ic-BL SN 2014ad^39. To directly compare the\nshapes and features we scaled SN 2013ge and SN 2014ad to best match the\nspectral shape and features at the blue end of the afterglow-subtracted\nspectrum where the SN component dominates.\n\nFig. 3: Spectral fit and comparisons.\n\nOur NIRSpec spectrum of GRB 221009A (blue, smoothed) after subtracting our\nbest-fit afterglow model. The unsubtracted spectrum, best-fit afterglow model\n(dashed black line) and best-fit SN + afterglow (black line) are shown in the\ninset. We show late-time spectra of SN 2013ge (gold^42) and SN 2014ad\n(magenta^39) scaled to match the shape and features of the afterglow-\nsubtracted spectrum at \u03bb \u2272 1.5 \u03bcm where the SN dominates, demonstrating the\noverall resemblance with these comparison supernovae Ic/Ic-BL. We also show SN\n1998bw (orange^40) scaled to the distance of GRB 221009A and the phase of our\nspectrum, showing that it matches not only the shape but the overall flux\nlevel of our spectrum. The close match with supernovae Ic-BL, in particular,\ndemonstrates the presence of a typical GRB-SN in our spectrum.\n\nFull size image\n\nThese events provide an excellent visual match to the afterglow-subtracted\nspectrum, which confirms that our estimate of the afterglow contribution is\nreasonable. In addition, the inferred ratio of Ca ii/O i is a much better\nmatch to the ratios seen in the three comparison objects compared with the\ncase of no afterglow subtraction (Extended Data Fig. 4). Although the width of\nthe Ca ii emission complex exhibits a better match with SN 2013ge, the\nafterglow-subtracted spectrum does not show the same strong absorption seen at\n~1.1 \u03bcm in SN 2013ge, possibly due to the SN associated with GRB 221009A\nhaving a higher ejecta velocity. SN Ic-BL-like velocities are further\nsupported by the better overall match to SN 2014ad and SN 1998bw. The narrower\nwidth of Ca ii compared with SN 2014ad and SN 1998bw may be an artefact of the\ninstrumental response affecting the shape at the blue end of the line. We also\nidentify evidence for a broad emission feature near \u03bb \u2248 1.5 \u03bcm, which is\nconsistent with the location of the 1.503 \u03bcm line of Mg i seen in the\ncomparison objects and large samples of other supernovae Ic/Ic-BL^39.\n\nIn summary, our spectrum is well fit by an SN and power-law model; we do not\nrequire another component to explain the spectrum, although we explore the\npossibility that the afterglow contribution is lower and whether some of the\nresulting red excess in such a model (Methods section \u2018Constraints on the\nafterglow contribution\u2019) could be explained by r-process emission in the\nsection \u2018No sign of r-process enrichment\u2019 and Methods section \u2018Comparison with\nr-process light curve models\u2019. Importantly, our afterglow-subtracted spectrum\nis similar to, although slightly fainter than, the expected flux of SN 1998bw\nat the distance of GRB 221009A and the phase of our observations, which\nsuggests that the SN associated with GRB 221009A produced a similar quantity\nof ^56Ni.\n\n### A modest nickel mass indicates a typical GRB-SN\n\nEstimates for the mass of ^56Ni produced in SN 1998bw range from ~0.3 M_\u2299 to\n~0.7 M_\u2299 depending on the models and assumptions used to fit the light\ncurve^43,44,45,46,47. Reference ^47 considered a two-zone model where \u22480.44\nM_\u2299 of ^56Ni is contained in an outer high-velocity component that rapidly\nexpands and becomes optically thin, explaining the bright peak luminosity. An\nadditional \u22480.12 M_\u2299 exists in an inner dense low-velocity component that\nexplains the linear nature of the light curve at intermediate phases of\n~100\u2013200 days.\n\nWe directly estimated the mass of ^56Ni produced by the SN associated with GRB\n221009A by integrating the afterglow-subtracted spectrum. We estimated the\nunobserved flux using SN 2007gr as a spectral template owing to its\nsimultaneous optical and NIR coverage out to the same phase of our\nobservations. We find that the wavelength coverage of our NIRSpec spectrum\naccounts for about 50% of the total emitted flux. At the phase of our\nobservations, the luminosity of a nickel-powered SN is dominated by the decay\nof ^56Co, the daughter isotope of ^56Ni. Assuming a single component of the\nejecta and full gamma-ray trapping, we find M_Ni \u2248 0.03 M_\u2299. Under a more\nrealistic assumption of gamma-ray leakage, with a timescale of ~100 days for\nthe ejecta to become optically thin to gamma-rays (as inferred for SN 1998bw),\nwe find M_Ni \u2248 0.09 M_\u2299.\n\nThe ^56Ni mass we infer assuming gamma-ray leakage is therefore slightly lower\nthan the mass inferred by ref. ^47 for the inner dense component of SN 1998bw,\nwhich is consistent with our inference that the SN associated with GRB 221009A\nis slightly fainter than SN 1998bw at late time. Of course, assuming a\ndifferent afterglow contribution in our spectrum will affect the estimated\nmass. Our inferred mass is consistent with the results of ref. ^30, who found\nbest-fit values from modelling the early light curve of GRB 221009A in the\nrange M_Ni = 0.05\u20130.25 M_\u2299, depending on assumptions about the host\nextinction, with a 99% upper limit of M_Ni < 0.36 M_\u2299. These values are lower\nthan most early light curve estimates for SN 1998bw^43,45,47. This may\nindicate a lower ratio of the outer-to-inner ejecta components compared with\nSN 1998bw, or that a two-component model is not needed to explain the SN\nassociated with GRB 221009A. Our results, combined with the early light curve\nestimates, conclusively rule out the possibility that the SN was unusually\nbright compared with previous GRB-SNe. This is consistent with previous sample\nstudies that do not show a correlation between the luminosities of LGRBs and\ntheir associated supernovae^24,48. Crucially, our spectroscopic detection of\nthe SN confirms that the marginal deviation from a typical afterglow in the\nearly light curve claimed by ref. ^29 and ref. ^30 was indeed due to the SN.\n\n### No signs of r-process enrichment\n\nThe identification of the SN associated with GRB 221009A allows us to\nconstrain the presence of r-process material. One possibility is that the red\nexcess in our spectrum consists of a combination of afterglow and emission\nfrom r-process elements. Reference ^15 outlines how a collapsar with a massive\ntransient disk can lead to r-process production. However, the observational\nimpact of r-process material, if it is produced, is highly dependent on the\ndegree of outward mixing. In particular, ref. ^15 presents two possible\nscenarios: one (the \u2018magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\u2019 case) in which 0.025 M_\u2299 of\nr-process elements are mixed uniformly throughout the SN ejecta with v < 0.15c\nand one (the \u2018collapsar\u2019 case) in which 0.25 M_\u2299 of r-process elements are\nconfined to v < 0.015c. In both cases, 0.25 M_\u2299 of ^56Ni is mixed in the\nejecta. In the MHD case, the r-process material tracks ^56Ni, whereas in the\ncollapsar case, the r-process elements are embedded behind the ^56Ni. In\ntruth, the degree of mixing in the collapsar wind scenario is unknown, and is\nlikely to be variable with progenitor properties and may be sufficient to mix\nr-process elements with the outer layers.\n\nAlthough the MHD scenario has largely been ruled out by early-time\nobservations of previous events^15,49, few constraints exist on the collapsar\nwind scenario due to the lack of late-time NIR spectra of GRB supernovae.\nBefore our NIRSpec spectrum of GRB 221009A, the latest NIR spectrum of a GRB-\nSN was that of SN 1998bw taken at +51 days, which we have shown is an\nexcellent match to our spectrum (Fig. 3) after subtracting our best-fit\nafterglow power law. Here we consider the possibility that our best-fit power\nlaw overestimates the afterglow contribution and that our much later spectrum\nof the SN associated with GRB 221009A differs from the +51 day NIR spectrum of\nSN 1998bw owing to the presence of r-process signatures.\n\nIn Fig. 4, we compare our NIRSpec spectrum, with various assumptions about the\nafterglow contribution, to r-process enriched SN models from ref. ^15 (with\nr-process masses up to 0.25 M_\u2299). We compare with models corresponding to a\nphase of 95 days after explosion, the latest phase available, and shift them\nto the distance of GRB 221009A. At this phase, the MHD SN differs considerably\nfrom an SN without r-process enrichment, producing strong emission at \u22481.8\u20132.4\n\u03bcm that is clearly not present in our spectrum whatever the assumption on\nafterglow contribution. The collapsar wind model, on the other hand, largely\nshows SN features from non-r-process elements, although with enhanced flux\nnear \u22482 \u03bcm compared with what is seen in normal supernovae.\n\nFig. 4: Comparison with r-process models.\n\nComparison of our NIRSpec spectrum of GRB 221009A with r-process enriched SN\nmodels from ref. ^15 corresponding to a phase of 95 days after explosion,\nwhich is the latest phase available. We show our original spectrum without\nafterglow subtraction (top blue), as well as the resulting spectra after\nsubtracting the ALMA-XRT power law (middle black) and our best-fit afterglow\nmodel (shown in Fig. 3, bottom, light blue). Our spectrum, even after\naccounting for the afterglow, is clearly distinct from the predictions of an\nMHD SN. We also do not see evidence for spectral features in our spectrum that\ncan be linked to the collapsar wind model and not attributed to the SN.\n\nFull size image\n\nOwing to the noise in our spectrum, we are unable to identify individual lines\nin this region of the spectrum, beyond the likely Mg i at \u03bb \u2248 1.5 \u03bcm. However,\nwe compared the overall flux level and find that assuming no afterglow\ncontribution (that is, the original unsubtracted spectrum) leads to much\nhigher continuum flux than the collapsar wind model for \u03bb > 1 \u03bcm. Furthermore,\nthe expected strong nebular SN lines are diluted with respect to the continuum\n(Methods), indicating an extra continuum source is present (the afterglow of\nthe GRB). Assuming the afterglow shape and normalization given by\ninterpolating the contemporaneous ALMA and XRT observations, we find that,\noverall, the spectrum is inconsistent with the collapsar wind model, which\nindicates that the spectrum cannot be explained by a combination of the ALMA-\nXRT power law and an r-process enriched SN. Given the strong resemblance to\nprevious supernovae across the full wavelength range when assuming our best-\nfit afterglow power-law shape and contribution (Fig. 3), it is unlikely that\nflux from r-process elements are contributing significantly to our spectrum.\nOur observation highlights the need for a systematic survey of nebular-phase\nLGRB spectra across a broad range of GRB properties, in particular, in light\nof the recent theoretical work that correlates these properties to the degree\nof r-process production^50,51. We additionally compare our observations to the\nbroadband colour evolution models due to r-process enrichment from ref. ^52,\nwhich further highlights the need for spectroscopy (Methods section\n\u2018Comparison with r-process light curve models\u2019).\n\n## Host galaxy properties\n\n### A very low-metallicity, star-forming galaxy\n\nThe host galaxy of GRB 221009A is readily apparent in our JWST/NIRCam imaging\nshown in Fig. 1. Consistent with analysis of the optical Hubble Space\nTelescope (HST) images^31, we find that GRB 221009A is located 0.24 \u00b1 0.01\narcsec (0.66 \u00b1 0.02 kpc assuming the cosmological parameters presented in ref.\n^53) from the centre of its host galaxy, which appears to be a near edge-on\nsystem. From our GALFIT modelling (Methods) we find that this galaxy is well\ndescribed by a single S\u00e9rsic component with index n = 1.2 \u00b1 0.1 and effective\nradius r_e = 2.15 \u00b1 0.07 kpc. These values represent the mean and standard\ndeviation across the four filters. The AB magnitudes in each filter\ncorresponding to the best-fit GALFIT models are m_F115W = 21.58 \u00b1 0.20 mag,\nm_F200W = 20.62 \u00b1 0.10 mag, m_F277W = 20.88 \u00b1 0.10 mag and m_F444W = 21.38 \u00b1\n0.05 mag (not corrected for Milky Way extinction).\n\nIn Fig. 5, we show the global host spectrum (that is, including flux from the\nentire resolved spectral trace) and the spectrum at the position of GRB\n221009A (see Methods for details of the spectral extractions). We also show\nthe \u2018host-only\u2019 spectrum, which represents an estimate of the host galaxy\nspectrum excluding the region of the GRB. Comparing the spectrum at the\nposition of the GRB with the host-only spectrum clearly shows that certain\nlines, mostly from molecular H_2, are much stronger at the position of GRB\n221009A.\n\nFig. 5: Host galaxy spectra.\n\nSpectrum of the total host galaxy including the site of the GRB (grey), the\n`host-only' spectrum excluding the GRB site (red; see Methods section \u2018Late-\ntime NIRSpec observations\u2019) and a narrow aperture centred on the location of\nGRB 221009A (blue). We detect narrow H, H_2, He, Fe and S emission lines from\nthe galaxy. Importantly, we see that some narrow emission lines change in\nstrength over this galaxy, having notably strong molecular H_2 emission in the\nregion of GRB 221009A. The continuum of the afterglow and SN component can be\nseen clearly in the blue spectrum as a deviation from the host-only spectrum.\n\nFull size image\n\nWe measured the global host properties by fitting the global host spectrum, as\nwell as our NIRCam photometry and HST photometry from ref. ^31, using the\nstellar population modelling code Prospector^54 (see Methods for details of\nthe modelling procedure). The best-fit model spectrum and photometry compared\nwith the observed data are shown in Fig. 6. We find that the host has a\nstellar mass of \\\\(\\log (M/{{{{M}}}}_{\\odot })=9.6{1}_{-0.04}^{+0.02}\\\\) and\nlow stellar and gas-phase metallicities of \\\\(\\log ({Z}_{* }/{Z}_{\\odot\n})=-0.8{1}_{-0.05}^{+0.04}\\\\) and \\\\(\\log ({Z}_{{{{\\rm{gas}}}}}/{Z}_{\\odot\n})=-0.9{6}_{-0.03}^{+0.09}\\\\), respectively. This is one of the lowest\nmetallicity environments of any LGRB, which is a class of objects that prefer\nlow-metallicity galaxies^55,56,57,58 and it is, to our knowledge, the lowest\nmetallicity environment of a GRB-SN to date. This may suggest that very low\nmetallicity is required to produce a very energetic GRB. In addition, the\ngalaxy exhibits a recent star formation rate (SFR) of SFR_100 Myr = 0.17 M_\u2299\nyr^\u22121. We also find that the galaxy exhibits a visual extinction of\n\\\\({A}_{\\rm{V}}=0.6{7}_{-0.07}^{+0.11}\\\\) mag. This is consistent with our\nextinction constraints from the early-phase JWST data (Methods) where we found\na best-fit total extinction of \\\\({A}_{\\rm{V}}=4.6{3}_{-0.64}^{+0.13}\\\\) mag,\nwhich is in good agreement, within uncertainties, with the nominal Milky Way\nvalue plus the host galaxy extinction found here. Our SFR and host extinction\nvalues are consistent with those measured from H\u03b1 and Pa\u03b1 detected in an\nearly-phase X-shooter spectrum of GRB 221009A (ref. ^20).\n\nFig. 6: Best-fit galaxy model.\n\nLeft, best-fit Prospector model photometry (green circles) and spectrum\n(green) compared with the observed photometry shown with 1\u03c3 error bars (orange\ncircles, our NIRCam photometry and HST photometry measured by ref. ^31).\nRight, best-fit Prospector spectrum compared with our NIRSpec spectrum\n(orange). The bottom panels present the residuals.\n\nFull size image\n\nWe additionally model the spectrum at the site of the GRB, and find a similar\ngas-phase metallicity of \\\\(\\log ({Z}_{{{{\\rm{gas}}}}}/{Z}_{\\odot\n})=-0.9{4}_{-0.06}^{+0.11}\\\\) and a lower stellar metallicity of \\\\(\\log\n({Z}_{* }/{Z}_{\\odot })=-1.6{6}_{-0.10}^{+0.26}\\\\) compared with the global\nhost galaxy (Extended Data Fig. 6), which indicates that the progenitor of GRB\n221009A originated from a low-metallicity environment.\n\n### Strong H_2 emission at the explosion site\n\nWe observe many narrow H_2 vibrational and rotational emission lines that\nappear strongest at the site of GRB 221009A, as highlighted in Fig. 5.\nMolecular hydrogen traces dense star-forming regions, consistent with a birth\ncloud of a massive stellar progenitor of a LGRB. Neglecting the afterglow\nitself, H_2 can be excited by both shocks (driven by, for example, stellar\nwinds or Herbig\u2013Haro objects) or directly by fluorescence^59,60. Following\nref. ^61, we compared the ratios of H_2 lines in the range ~1.1\u20132.1 \u03bcm with\nvarious models of fluorescence versus collisionally excited emission from ref.\n^59 using a simple chi-squared metric (with appropriately propagated\nuncertainties). Owing to the strong detection of many lines (which are\npredicted to be absent in the case of collisional excitation), we find a\nbetter match to fluorescence models, which is consistent with the dominant\nexcitation method in many low-metallicity, blue compact dwarf galaxies^61. Our\nmeasured line ratios and predicted model ratios are given in Extended Data\nTable 2.\n\nOnly one other LGRB host, that of GRB 031203 (a relatively faint LGRB), has\nhad a marginal detection of H_2 emission^62. Molecular H in absorption due to\nvibrational excitation has also been observed in a small number of events\n(see, for example, refs. ^63,64). Statistical studies of GRB hosts have found\nthat most lack vibrationally excited H_2 (for example, ref. ^65), which\nsuggests that molecular H production is suppressed in LGRB hosts. It has been\nsuggested that this suppression may be partially due to the low metallicities\nof the hosts^66 or the ongoing star formation, leading to a strong ionizing\nfield^67. The low metallicity and modest SFR measured by Prospector suggests\nthat the latter may lead to observable H_2 emission in this event. These\nobservations highlight the importance of the unique sensitivity and spatial\nresolution of the JWST when analysing the local environments of LGRB\nprogenitors.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nWe present the detection with the JWST of an SN associated with the highly\nenergetic event GRB 221009A. Despite being associated with the brightest GRB\never observed, the SN produced a modest amount (\u22480.09 M_\u2299) of radioactive\n^56Ni with no obvious signs of r-process nucleosynthesis. The host galaxy\nsuggests a very low-metallicity progenitor system\u2014one of the lowest\nmetallicity environments of all known LGRBs. In addition, the exceptional\nsensitivity and spatial resolution of the JWST allows us to detect a series of\nmultiple molecular H_2 emission lines at the position of the GRB, which is an\nobservation that has been long anticipated. A secondary site of r-process\nnucleosynthesis remains an open question, which can observationally be\nuniquely probed by late-time IR spectroscopy. Our findings motivate future\nJWST campaigns to examine the nebular-phase spectra of supernovae associated\nwith LGRBs.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Imaging observations and photometry\n\nWe obtained imaging of GRB 221009A with the NIRCam using the F115W, F200W,\nF277W and F444W filters on 22 April 2023 starting at 07:08 UT. Each\nobservation consisted of four dithered exposures with a total exposure time of\n558 seconds. We downloaded the stage 3 pipeline products from the Mikulski\nArchive for Space Telescopes (MAST) for analysis. GRB 221009A is clearly\ndetected, along with its host galaxy.\n\nTo measure the flux from GRB 221009A in each filter, we first modelled the\nhost galaxy contribution using the galaxy profile fitting code GALFIT^68. We\nmodelled the host galaxy as a single S\u00e9rsic component. During the fit, we\nmasked the pixels containing the light from GRB 221009A; we fitted for\ntransient flux in a later step. The input, best-fit model and residual (best-\nfit model subtracted off) images are shown in Fig. 1. The residual image for\nthe F115W filter shows no structure indicating that the galaxy light is well\ndescribed by a single S\u00e9rsic component. The residual images in the three\nredder filters, however, exhibit remaining diffuse structure not captured by\nthe model near the centre of the galaxy and to the northeast. Although there\nis no obvious evidence for such diffuse structure emanating from the position\nof GRB 221009A, it is plausible that GRB 221009A is co-located with a brighter\nregion of its host galaxy that is not captured by our galaxy model. Such a\ndetermination can only be made when the transient fades.\n\nNext, we performed point spread function (PSF) photometry on the residual\nimages at the location of GRB 221009A. As WebbPSF only generates PSF models\nfor use with stage 2 imaging data, we used the following custom procedure to\ngenerate drizzled PSFs for use with stage 3 data. We generated stage 2 images\nwith model PSFs planted at the location of GRB 221009A and then ran these\nimages through the stage 3 pipeline. We then used the drizzled PSF models for\nthe PSF fitting of GRB 221009A. We found the following AB magnitudes in each\nfilter: m_F115W = 25.10 \u00b1 0.05 mag, m_F200W = 24.12 \u00b1 0.11 mag, m_F277W =\n23.77 \u00b1 0.05 mag and m_F444W = 23.22 \u00b1 0.08 mag (not corrected for extinction,\nwhich we assess in detail in Methods section \u2018Constraints on foreground dust\nfrom early-time spectroscopy\u2019). The uncertainties include the systematic\nuncertainty associated with the GALFIT modelling procedure, which we estimated\nby comparing PSF photometry with and without galaxy subtraction with GALFIT.\n\n### Spectroscopic observations and data reduction\n\n#### Late-time NIRSpec observations\n\nWe obtained spectra of GRB 221009A on 20 April 2023 with the NIRSpec^69\nonboard JWST (programme 2784; principal investigator (PI), Blanchard). Our\nobservations began at 14:40 UT, corresponding to a rest-frame phase of 167.7\ndays since the Fermi GBM trigger. Spectra were taken with the S200A1 fixed\nslit and the medium-resolution gratings G140M/F100LP and G235M/F170LP,\nyielding wavelength coverage in the range ~1\u20133 \u03bcm. For each grating and filter\nset-up, we used five primary dithers and a total exposure time of 10,942\nseconds. Owing to the small offset of GRB 221009A from its host galaxy^31,\ntarget acquisition was performed using an offset star to ensure proper\ncentring of the source in the slit.\n\nWe downloaded and inspected the pipeline products available on the MAST. A\nresolved trace is clearly present in the individual stage 2 exposures and\nfinal combined stage 3 products, indicating a substantial host galaxy\ncontribution. In addition, a compact trace spanning ~2 pixels is apparent at\nthe red end of the G140M/F100LP spectrum and the G235M/F170LP spectrum at the\nexpected location of GRB 221009A within the slit. This trace is also at a\nconsistent offset from the brightest part of the resolved trace representing\nthe centre of the host galaxy, which confirms that this unresolved trace is\nthe spectrum of GRB 221009A.\n\nThe pipeline products available on MAST were reduced using nod-subtraction,\nthe default background subtraction method for a point source with multiple\ndithered exposures. Owing to the resolved nature of the overall trace, we re-\nreduced the data using the JWST Science Calibration Pipeline with nod-\nsubtraction turned off to reduce the effect of subtracting source flux from\nitself. We then extract the one-dimensional spectrum of GRB 221009A from our\nre-reduced stage 3 combined and rectified two-dimensional (2D) spectra for\nfurther analysis. The final 2D spectra are shown in Extended Data Figs. 1 and\n2 (see Fig. 1 for the slit orientation).\n\nWe used the following extraction procedure to isolate the flux associated with\nGRB 221009A from the light of its host galaxy. We modelled the spatial profile\nof the overall trace as a two-component Gaussian with centres fixed at the\nposition of GRB 221009A and the centre of the host galaxy. We fitted the total\nspatial profile, summed over all wavelengths, to determine the best-fit\nGaussian width of each component. We then fitted this model, with widths fixed\nat these values, to the spatial profile at each wavelength. We also fitted for\na linear background component determined from background regions located on\nboth sides of the trace. The sum of the flux in each fitted Gaussian component\nthus represents the flux from GRB 221009A and its host galaxy as a function of\nwavelength. The resulting spectra of GRB 221009A in the G140M and G235M\ngratings are shown in Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2, respectively. We also show\ncorresponding error spectra calculated from the 2D pipeline-generated error\narrays for each grating. The fit to the host galaxy Gaussian component yields\na \u2018host-only\u2019 spectrum.\n\nWe note that the background exhibits evidence for PSF artefacts that are\npotentially from a nearby bright star (the pseudoperiodic signal at pixel rows\n~18\u201324 in the 2D frames; Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2), which is the most\nlikely explanation given the crowded nature of the field. Owing to the\ndifficulty of accurately modelling this component of the background, our\nbackground regions exclude those containing such artefacts. Our fitted\nbackground therefore represents the smooth underlying sky background. This may\nmean that the background at the location of GRB 221009A and its host galaxy is\nunderestimated. However, we extract regions of the background containing the\nsuspected PSF artefacts from a nearby star and find no evidence that these\nfeatures are present in our extracted spectrum of GRB 221009A. In addition,\nthe flux from these features decreases towards the spatial location of the GRB\nspectral trace.\n\n#### Combined G140M + G235M spectrum compared with photometry\n\nAs the photometry was obtained only two days after our NIRSpec spectra, we\nused the photometry to check the flux calibration of the spectra. We find that\nthe fluxes in the four NIRCam filters are an excellent match to the flux\ncalibration of the G140M and G235M spectra. In addition, the two spectra agree\nin the wavelength region where the gratings overlap. In Fig. 2, we show the\nfluxes in each filter compared with the combined G140M + G235M spectrum.\n\n#### Host galaxy spectral extractions\n\nAs seen in Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2, the host galaxy is resolved in our\nJWST/NIRSpec observations, extending across approximately ten rows in our 2D\nspectra and with numerous narrow emission lines. To study the global host\nproperties, we extracted the entire trace including the position of the GRB.\nWe note that there is significant variation of the strength of some emission\nlines across the spatial extent of the galaxy, where several lines are\nstronger at the position of GRB 221009A. To identify these lines and assess\nany potential variation in the galaxy properties at the position of the GRB,\nwe extracted a narrow aperture centred on the position of GRB 221009A. This\ndiffers from the Gaussian decomposition procedure described in Methods section\n\u2018Late-time NIRSpec observations\u2019 used to isolate the GRB spectrum, as here we\nare not modelling and subtracting the underlying host spectrum; the goal here\nis to measure the host properties at the position of the GRB.\n\n#### Archival NIRSpec/MIRI observations\n\nWe obtained archival spectroscopic observations of GRB 221009A from JWST,\nobserved with NIRSpec and the MIRI on 22 Oct 2022 (programme 2782; PI, Levan\nand originally presented in ref. ^31). These observations correspond to 13.16\nand 13.2 days post burst, respectively.\n\nAt this epoch, the NIRSpec observations were taken in the low-resolution PRISM\nmode, with spectral coverage from ~0.5 \u03bcm to ~5.5 \u03bcm. The pipeline products\nfrom MAST reveal a clear, high signal-to-noise ratio trace in the 2D spectrum.\nThe stage 3, reduced spectrum is consistent with that published in ref. ^31,\nand we thus use it for analysis in this work without additional reductions.\n\nThe MIRI spectrum was taken in the low-resolution spectroscopy mode with the\nP750L disperser. The automatic reduction of the MIRI spectrum failed, which\nwas likely to be due to improper selection of the afterglow trace. We used the\nofficial MIRI reduction pipeline to manually extract the spectrum from the\nstage 2 products, carefully selecting the correct trace and appropriate\nbackground from the nodded 2D image. At this epoch, the afterglow trace is\nclearly identified in the 2D spectrum and easily isolated using a simple\nboxcar extraction. We note that MIRI is uncalibrated below \u03bb \u2272 4.5 \u03bcm at the\ntime of analysis, and we therefore removed data below this wavelength of the\nspectrum from analysis. The MIRI observations are qualitatively consistent\nwith those of ref. ^31 and are well matched to their near-simultaneous\nphotometric observation in F560W.\n\n### ALMA observations\n\nFollowing the seven epochs of ALMA observations of GRB 221009A through\nprogramme 2022.1.01433.T (PI, Laskar), we obtained two additional epochs with\nthe same programme on 01 March 2023 at a mean time of 15:41 UT and on 11 April\n2023 at a mean time of 07:55 UT, corresponding to 143.6514 and 183.7838 days\nin the observer frame, respectively (\u2248124.80 and \u2248159.67 days in the rest\nframe). Both observations utilized two 4 GHz wide base-bands centred at 91.5\nand 103.5 GHz, respectively with J1924 \u2212 2914 as bandpass calibrator and J1914\n+ 1636 as complex gain calibrator. The millimetre-band afterglow previously\nreported in ref. ^25 was clearly detected in the pipeline-processed science-\nready data products in the first of the two epochs and more weakly (\u22484.7\u03c3)\ndetected in the second epoch. We performed photometry using imfit in the\nCommon Astronomy Software Applications^70 and find a best-fit flux density in\nthe two epochs of (163 \u00b1 22) \u03bcJy and (104 \u00b1 23) \u03bcJy (including a 5% systematic\nflux calibration uncertainty) at a mean frequency of 97.5 GHz, along with a\nposition of RA = 19 h 13 m 03.50 s and dec.= 19^\u221846\u203224.3\u2032\u2032 with an uncertainty\nof 0.1^\u2032\u2032 in each coordinate (consistent across both epochs). Together with\nthe last ALMA 97.5 GHz measurement reported in ref. ^25, the temporal decline\nrate of the millimetre-band afterglow at ~99\u2013188 days after the burst\n(observer frame) is \u03b1_mm = \u22121.54 \u00b1 0.08, which implies an extrapolated\nmillimetre-band flux density of (99 \u00b1 23) \u03bcJy at the time of the NIRSpec\nobservations (194 days, observer frame).\n\n### Swift/XRT observations\n\nWe downloaded the count-rate light curve of the X-ray afterglow of GRB 221009A\nfrom the Swift/XRT website^71. Using the spectral parameters presented in ref.\n^25 (Milky Way (MW) absorption of N_H,MW = 5.36 \u00d7 10^21 cm^\u22122, intrinsic\nabsorption of N_H,int = 1.35 \u00d7 10^22 cm^\u22122 and photon index of \u0393_X = 1.8566),\nwe converted the observed count rate to a flux density (F_X) at 1 keV and\nobtained F_X = (9.3 \u00b1 3.5) \u00d7 10^\u22123 \u03bcJy at \\\\(19{6}_{-9.1}^{+5.5}\\\\) days\n(observer frame; corresponding to \\\\(170.{4}_{-7.9}^{+4.9}\\\\) days, rest\nframe) after the burst. Comparing this with our ALMA observations, we find\nthat the spectral index between the ALMA and XRT observations at the time of\nthe NIRSpec observations (\u2248194 days, observer frame) is \u03b2_ALMA-XRT = 0.63 \u00b1\n0.03. We refer to this number elsewhere in the text as the ALMA-XRT power law,\nanchored to the inferred ALMA flux density of \u22480.1 mJy at the time of the\nNIRSpec observations.\n\n### Constraints on foreground dust from early-time spectroscopy\n\nGiven the location of GRB 221009A in the Galactic plane (b \u2248 4^\u2218), we expected\nsubstantial extinction due to interstellar dust in the MW. Reference ^36\nestimates the MW extinction contribution to be A_V = 4.10 \u00b1 0.06, assuming the\nstandard extinction factor R_V = 3.1. As noted in ref. ^72, these dust maps\ncan be unreliable for low galactic latitudes^73. Furthermore, this measurement\nneglects host contribution; however, given the relatively low redshift, we do\nnot expect to easily distinguish between dust arising from either the MW or\nhost galaxy (see, for example, the results of ref. ^20). For simplicity, we\nneglect redshift dependence of dust.\n\nGiven the significant uncertainties expected, we opted to use the first epoch\nof NIRSpec/MIRI data to determine the appropriate extinction correction. We\nassumed that the spectrum is dominated by some unknown combination of an\nafterglow (power-law model) and a thermal, SN-like component. Unless r-process\nmaterial is mixed significantly within the ejecta, we do not expect a red\nthermal component at early times. As such, we assumed that the event is\ndominated by a power-law afterglow at \u03bb_obs \u2273 3 \u03bcm; below this wavelength, it\nis reasonable that a SN 1998bw-like event could contribute significant flux.\nWe explore the systematic uncertainties associated with the extinction laws\nand assumptions on the SN contribution.\n\nFew extinction laws are calibrated across the full wavelength range covered by\nthe NIRSpec/MIRI observations; a new extinction law describing A(\u03bb)/A(V) as a\nfunction of R(V) in the range ~0.1\u201330 \u03bcm has been recently presented^38. We\ncontrast this solution with the commonly used extinction law described in ref.\n^37 to quantify systematic uncertainty from assumptions of dust laws. Given a\nprescribed dust law, we simultaneously fitted the observed day 13.2 (observer\nframe) spectrum to a power law (F_\u03bd \u221d \u03bd^\u2212\u03b2) and extinction parameters A_V and\nR_V using a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler implemented in emcee^74. Our\nmodels have four free parameters: the overall power-law normalization\n(\u2018norm\u2019), the power-law index \u03b2, the dust A_V and R_V values, and a white\nnoise scatter term. The scatter quantifies the uncertainty in JWST flux\nestimates as a fraction of the flux. We assumed a wide uniform prior for all\nparameters except normalization, in which we assumed a log\u2013uniform prior.\n\nWe first fitted using the dust law presented in ref. ^38. Fitting all observed\nwavelengths \u03bb_obs < 8 \u03bcm, we find \u03b2 = 0.39 \u00b1 0.01, A_V = 4.37 \u00b1 0.05 and\n\\\\({R}_{\\rm{V}}=3.0{7}_{-0.05}^{+0.04}\\\\). At \u03bb < 2 \u03bcm, we find that the\nresiduals are consistent with 0, suggesting no contribution from an additional\nthermal component. We next excluded wavelengths <2 \u03bcm in the fitting process\nto test the possibility of contamination from either a SN-like or r-process\nthermal event. We find that when excluding these wavelengths, the afterglow\nmodel overestimates the blue flux.\n\nNext, we fitted using the extinction law described in ref. ^37 (that is,\nfollowing the original analysis of ref. ^31). Again, we emphasize that this\nextinction law is not calibrated for IR observations and simply extrapolates\nat these wavelengths. We simultaneously fitted the observed spectrum (\u03bb_obs <\n8 \u03bcm) to a power law and extinction model. We find \u03b2 = 0.41 \u00b1 0.01,\n\\\\({A}_{\\rm{V}}=4.6{3}_{-0.64}^{+0.13}\\\\) and\n\\\\({R}_{\\rm{V}}=4.2{4}_{-0.64}^{+0.74}\\\\). This is significantly different\n(>3\u03c3) from the results presented in ref. ^31 when only accounting for\nstatistical uncertainties, which we attribute to a tight prior (versus our\nflat prior) set by those authors.\n\nWe report the results of our fits in Extended Data Table 1 and show these\ndata, models and associated residuals in Extended Data Fig. 3. The residuals\nof both dust models show significant structure throughout the spectrum. We\nspecifically compared the residuals to a spectrum of SN 1998bw taken 12 days\npost burst and scaled to the redshift of GRB 221009A. We note that the\nstatistical uncertainties and systematic difference between these two dust\nextinction models mean that we are unable to make a conclusive statement on\nthe SN emission from the early-time JWST spectrum. This is a different\nconclusion from that of ref. ^31, who, given their small statistical\nuncertainties, rule out SN 1998bw-like thermal emission at early times.\n\n### Constraints on the afterglow contribution\n\n#### Initial comparisons with previous supernovae\n\nIn Extended Data Fig. 5, we show our extinction-corrected spectrum (using the\nlaw in ref. ^37 and best-fit parameters listed in Extended Data Table 1)\ncompared with spectra of SN 1998bw^40, the canonical SN Ic-BL associated with\na GRB and SN 2013ge^42, one of the few supernovae Ic with high S/N late-time\nNIR spectra, taken at +51 and +118 days after peak, respectively. To achieve\ncomplete overlap with the blue end of our spectrum, we combined the +51 day\nNIR spectrum of SN 1998bw with an optical spectrum taken at +73 days. We\nscaled the spectra of SN 1998bw and SN 2013ge to the distance of GRB 221009A\nand used their light curves^41,42 to normalize to their brightnesses at the\nphase of our GRB 221009A spectrum. Our spectrum of GRB 221009A is brighter\nthan the comparison supernovae would be and relatively featureless with a\ndifferent overall spectral shape, which is consistent with significant\ncontamination from the afterglow. Our spectrum exhibits flux increasing at \u03bb \u2273\n1.5 \u03bcm, whereas the comparison supernovae exhibit declining flux.\n\nThe emission features shown in Extended Data Fig. 4 exhibit similar, although\nslightly narrower, widths than the corresponding features in SN 1998bw, SN\n2013ge and SN 2014ad. Owing to the lack of a late-time light curve for SN\n2014ad, we scaled its spectrum to roughly match SN 1998bw for comparison\npurposes. In addition, the lines in our JWST spectrum are diluted in strength\nand exhibit a different flux ratio. This, combined with the rising flux to the\nred, means that there is no simple luminosity scaling that will bring our\nspectrum of GRB 221009A into agreement with the comparison spectra. These\nobservations are consistent with afterglow contamination. Furthermore, the\nlack of many strong SN features (for example, the strong P-Cygni features near\n\u22481 \u03bcm, \u22481.5 \u03bcm and \u22482 \u03bcm commonly seen in supernovae^39) other than the two\nidentified (Ca ii NIR triplet and O i at \u22480.86 \u03bcm and \u22480.92 \u03bcm, respectively)\nindicates that the SN associated with GRB 221009A is not substantially\nbrighter than SN 1998bw and SN 2013ge.\n\n#### Constraints from contemporaneous ALMA and Swift/XRT observations\n\nDetermining the afterglow contribution is critical for constraining the\npresence of SN emission and a possible contribution from r-process material.\nFirst, we considered the power law formed by the ALMA and XRT observations\nthat we obtained around the same phase as our JWST observations. We analysed\nthe residual spectrum by subtracting off the ALMA-XRT power law from our\nspectrum of GRB 221009A which we show, compared with SN 1998bw and SN 2013ge,\nin Extended Data Fig. 5. Although the resulting spectrum matches more closely\nthe shape of the supernovae compared to the unsubtracted spectrum, in\nparticular at the blue end, the shape at \u03bb \u2273 1.5 \u03bcm still exhibits rising flux\nsubstantially different from the supernovae. Given the lack of strong emission\nfeatures in this region, the most likely explanation is that the ALMA-XRT\npower-law model does not adequately capture the afterglow contribution. In\nsection \u2018No signs of r-process enrichment\u2019 and Methods section \u2018Comparison\nwith r-process light curve models\u2019, we consider whether this red excess could\nbe due to emission from r-process material.\n\n#### Varying the afterglow contribution\n\nNext we considered the best-fit power law from fitting our spectrum at \u03bb \u2273 1.5\n\u03bcm (shown in Fig. 3) and analysed how the implied SN component changes with\ndifferent afterglow normalizations. We scaled the best-fit power law by\nfactors of 0.3, 0.6, 0.9 and 1.0 to generate four potential afterglow models,\nsubtracted them from the spectrum and compared the resulting residual spectra\nwith SN 1998bw and SN 2013ge. In Supplementary Fig. 1, we show the residual\nspectra and afterglow models for the four scalings. When scaled by 0.3 and\n0.6, the residual spectra still exhibit flux rising to the red, as in the\nunsubtracted spectrum, which indicates that these models are not likely to\naccount for all of the afterglow flux.\n\nIn addition, there is a mismatch between the flux ratios of the expected\nemission lines. In other words, the detection of the Ca ii NIR triplet at the\nstrength we see, would imply the detection of other lines at strengths that\nare not observed. Of course, this reasoning relies on the assumption that the\nSN associated with GRB 221009A should appear similar to previous supernovae\nIc/Ic-BL. Indeed it is possible that this SN may not show the same features as\nprevious events and potentially an additional component from r-process\nemission which we assess in section \u2018No signs of r-process enrichment\u2019 and\nMethods section \u2018Comparison with r-process light curve models\u2019. However, the\nlack of strong lines in this region indicates that the SN associated with GRB\n221009A is likely to be fainter than these models suggest and the afterglow is\ncorrespondingly brighter (as found when performing a joint SN + afterglow fit;\nsee section \u2018Isolating the SN signal\u2019), such that most emission lines are\ndiluted with respect to the continuum and are not detectable.\n\nIf instead the best-fit power law is scaled by 0.9, the residual spectrum\nappears consistent with the comparison spectra and is a close match to the\noverall flux level of SN 1998bw. Note that this is similar to the best-fit\nscaling (0.94) when performing the joint SN + afterglow fit as described in\n\u2018Isolating the SN signal\u2019 and shown in Fig. 3. Larger afterglow contributions\n(for example, scaling by 1.0) yield an overall steeper slope, inconsistent\nwith the comparison objects.\n\n### Comparison with r-process light curve models\n\nWe also considered the r-process enriched SN light curve models in ref. ^52.\nIn Supplementary Fig. 2, we show the J\u2013H and J\u2013K colour evolution of these\nmodels, for an SN Ic-BL with a typical simulated ejecta mass of 3.96 M_\u2299, a\n^56Ni mass of 0.33 M_\u2299, an r-process material mass of 0.03 M_\u2299 and various\nlevels of r-process mixing, from no mixing to nearly fully mixed, compared\nwith the colours of the SN component of GRB 221009A under different afterglow\nassumptions. We calculated J\u2013H and J\u2013K colours by convolving the filter\nbandpasses with our NIRSpec spectrum after subtracting the afterglow models.\nWe show the resulting colours for the afterglow models considered in section\n\u2018Constraints on the afterglow contribution\u2019 (the ALMA-XRT power law and the\nbest-fit power law from fitting the red end of our spectrum with various\nnormalizations; Extended Data Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 1).\n\nThe J\u2013K colours of the afterglow-subtracted spectra match the r-process\nenriched models when scaling the best-fit power law by \u22720.9. Decreasing the\nafterglow contribution leads to more residual red light, leading to redder\ncolours. When scaling by \u22720.6, including the ALMA-XRT model, the J\u2013K colours,\nif reddened due to r-process material, would imply significant mixing. In this\ncase, strong broad emission lines from r-process elements would be expected,\nas seen in the MHD model in Fig. 4 but not in our data. In addition, for a\ngiven afterglow contribution, the J\u2013H colours imply a different degree of\nr-process mixing than the J\u2013K colours, which suggests that the reddening\nsource is not due to r-process emission.\n\nIn Supplementary Fig. 2, we also show the colours of SN 1998bw and SN 2013ge\ncalculated from their late-time NIR spectra. SN 1998bw is notably blue\u2014bluer\neven than the models without r-process\u2014which suggests that these models do not\nfully capture the range of possible spectral energy distributions of typical\nGRB supernovae. SN 2013ge is notably red, which is consistent with the\nr-process enriched models for a mixing fraction of ~10%. This event, however,\nexhibits a clear example of carbon monoxide emission increasing the flux in\nthe K-band. These comparisons highlight that, without spectra, other sources\nof reddening are difficult to disentangle from that due to r-process material.\nSimilar conclusions have been drawn from studies of large samples of\nsupernovae Ic-BL light curves^49. We note that the spectrum of GRB 221009A\nafter subtracting the best-fit power law scaled by 0.9, which yields a good\nvisual match to SN 1998bw and SN 2013ge (Supplementary Fig. 1), exhibits a J\u2013K\ncolour that is ~0.1 mag redder than the no r-process model. However, as can be\nseen in Supplementary Fig. 1, there is an upturn in the spectrum in the K-band\nat the expected location of the first overtone carbon monoxide emission,\nsimilar to that seen in SN 2013ge.\n\n### Host galaxy modelling\n\nWe used Prospector^54, a Bayesian galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED)\nfitting code to simultaneously fit the global host galaxy photometry and\nspectroscopy. Additionally, we fitted the spectrum extracted at the position\nof the GRB to compare the global host properties and those at the GRB\nposition. We adopted the MIST isochrones^75 and the C3K stellar spectral\nlibraries in the Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis^76,77 framework. The\nstellar population is described by redshift, stellar mass, velocity\ndispersion, stellar metallicity and a step function non-parametric star\nformation history with 14 time bins^78. The nebular emission was parametrized\nby gas-phase metallicity and ionization parameter using the CLOUDY grid in\nref. ^79. We simultaneously fitted simple Gaussians to lines that are not\nincluded in our emission line model that assumes that all the emission is\npowered by the stars, namely, the He i, [Fe ii] and H_2 emission lines, with\nthe same kinematics but free amplitudes as our CLOUDY grid. We assumed a\nflexible two-component dust attenuation model that accounted for birth cloud\nand diffuse dust separately^80. Variation in the shape of the attenuation\ncurve was enabled using a power-law modification to a Calzetti curve^81. We\nalso incorporated the contribution of dust emission to the infrared photometry\nusing a three-parameter model^82. To fit the spectroscopy and photometry\ntogether, we marginalized over the shape of the observed spectrum (thereby\navoiding any wavelength-dependent flux calibration issues) with a polynomial;\nin this manner, the normalization and shape of the SED was entirely determined\nby the photometry, or not constrained at all for the GRB position, where there\nis no photometry. We also included a jitter parameter that inflated the\nspectroscopy uncertainties to account for imperfect JWST flux calibration and\nslit losses, and found typical values of 1.5\u20132, which are consistent with\nother early JWST spectroscopic analyses^83,84,85. Finally, we used a pixel\noutlier model to downweight pixels that were not consistent with our model^86,\nwhich were typically identified at a 1\u20132% level. In summary, the SED model for\nthe host galaxy fit has 28 free parameters, and the fit to the spectrum at the\nGRB position has 24 free parameters.\n\n## Data availability\n\nThe JWST data analysed in this work associated with programmes 2784 and 2782\nare publicly available on the MAST archive.\n\n## Code availability\n\nThe software tools used in this work (JWST Science Calibration Pipeline,\nGALFIT, WebbPSF, Prospector and Common Astronomy Software Applications) are\npublicly available.\n\n## References\n\n  1.

Blanchard.\n\n## Ethics declarations\n\n### Competing interests\n\nThe authors declare no competing interests.\n\n## Peer review\n\n### Peer review information\n\nNature Astronomy thanks Lauren Rhodes and the other, anonymous, reviewer(s)\nfor their contribution to the peer review of this work.\n\n## Additional information\n\nPublisher\u2019s note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional\nclaims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\n\n## Extended data\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 1 NIRSpec/G140M Spectrum.\n\nTop: Final combined 2D NIRSpec/G140M spectrum of GRB 221009A resulting from\nour re-reduction. The trace is clearly dominated by the spatially resolved\nhost galaxy. A broad emission feature is visible near \u2248 1\u03bcm (white arrow) at\nthe expected spatial location of GRB 221009A (red arrow). The background below\nthe trace contains structure that is likely due to the diffraction spike of a\nnearby star. Spatially resolved emission lines from the host galaxy are also\ndetected. Bottom: 1D spectrum of GRB 221009A extracted via a two-component\nGaussian fit to the spatially resolved trace to isolate the spectrum of GRB\n221009A from the host galaxy contribution.\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 2 NIRSpec/G235M Spectrum.\n\nTop: Final combined 2D NIRSpec/G235M spectrum of GRB 221009A resulting from\nour re-reduction. The trace from GRB 221009A (red arrow) is more clearly\nvisible at the red end. Bottom: 1D spectrum of GRB 221009A extracted via a\ntwo-component Gaussian fit to the spatially resolved trace to isolate the\nspectrum of GRB 221009A from the host galaxy contribution. Notably, several\nhost galaxy emission lines appear to be stronger at the position of GRB\n221009A than the rest of the galaxy, resulting in significant excess flux from\nthese lines appearing in the GRB 221009A spectrum (see Fig. 5 for line\nidentifications).\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 3 Extinction Fits to the Early JWST Data.\n\nTop: Comparison of the early-time NIRSpec/PRISM and MIRI spectra (black) along\nwith two models for the afterglow and dust law ([37] in blue, and [38] in\norange). Each line of the model represents a draw from the posterior. Note\nthat there is a silicate feature at \u2243 10\u03bcm which is not properly modeled\nwithout a detailed dust composition; here, we fit \u03bb < 8\u03bcm to avoid this\nfeature. Bottom: Model residuals compared to SN 1998bw (black; [40]). Again,\nindividual lines represent independent draws from the model posterior. For\nboth laws, strong systematic residuals are found across the full wavelength\nrange. An SN 1998bw-like supernova cannot be ruled out.\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 4 Broad SN Features.\n\nLeft: Zoom-in on the blue end of our spectrum of GRB 221009A highlighting the\nbroad emission features we attribute to the CaII NIR triplet and OI. Also\nshown are comparison spectra of SN 1998bw (orange) and SN 2013ge (gold) both\nscaled to the distance of GRB 221009A and their brightness at the phase of our\nobservations, as well as SN 2014ad (magenta) arbitrarily scaled. Right:\nSpectrum of GRB 221009A after subtracting our best-fit afterglow model from\nthe joint SN+afterglow fit described by the power law F_\u03bd \u221d \u03bd^\u22120.76\u00b10.07.\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 5 Comparisons with Previous SNe and Assessment of the\nALMA-XRT Power Law.\n\nLeft: Our NIRSpec spectrum of GRB 221009A, corrected for extinction using the\nlaw from ref. ^37 and best-fit parameters from the fitting described in the\nMethods (blue), compared to ground-based late-time NIR spectra of SN 1998bw\n(orange) and SN 2013ge (gold) scaled to the distance of GRB 221009A and the\nsame phase of our observations. Right: Comparison between SN 1998bw and SN\n2013ge and our spectrum of GRB 221009A (smoothed) after subtracting an\nestimate of the afterglow contribution as described by the power law\nconnecting ALMA and Swift/XRT observations taken around the same phase as our\nJWST data (F_\u03bd \u221d \u03bd^\u22120.63; black line). Significant flux rising toward the red\nremains in the resulting subtracted spectrum, inconsistent with the comparison\nSNe, indicating this model likely does not adequately describe the afterglow\ncontribution at these wavelengths.\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 6 Galaxy Model Posteriors.\n\nComparison of the Prospector model parameter posteriors for the galaxy spectra\nextracted at the location of GRB 221009A (orange) and the total galaxy (blue).\nThe gas-phase metallicities are similar, but the GRB position exhibits a lower\nstellar metallicity.\n\nExtended Data Table 1 Extinction Fitting Results\n\nFull size table\n\nExtended Data Table 2 H_2 Emission Line Measurements\n\nFull size table\n\n## Supplementary information\n\n### Supplementary Information\n\nSupplementary Figs. 1 and 2.\n\n## Rights and permissions\n\nOpen Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\nInternational License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate\ncredit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the\nCreative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.
