This post will render away all doubt\nabout my technolust. I love hardware. I love exotic hardware that I\u2019ve never\nseen before. I love to program or configure directly against this hardware to\nsqueeze every last bit of performance out of it. Think how some (even old)\nXBox or Playstation games still are amazing on the platform that is a decade\nold. They programmed down to the metal.\n\nWhere do you host your website?

There have been\n> rumors and conspiracy theories that Hussein\u2019s regime had developed a\n> powerful gaming console-based computer for military purposes, but these\n> claims have been widely debunked.\n>\n> The story likely originated from a 2000 article in the Iraqi newspaper Al-\n> Nasiriya Al-Gadida, which claimed that Iraqi scientists had built a\n> supercomputer using 3,000\n>\n> PlayStation 2 consoles.

If you want ME to build a super computer\nout of playstation2\u2019s let me know.\n\n## Building a Better Large Language Model System\n\nIf you have been following along, I have a consumer level machine learning rig\nand a Poweredge r720. Things are going great but I figured I\u2019d work my way\ntowards the newer GPUs for servers. I needed a new server and, why not let\u2019s\ntry the r730. It is a little more expensive on e-bay but it looks a bit better\nspec wise in some areas I find desirable.\n\nWhat area\u2019s are those?\n\n> >>> what is difference from a PCIe bus between a r720 and an r730?\n>\n> Both the Dell PowerEdge R720 and R730 servers use Peripheral Component\n> Interconnect Express (PCIe) slots to connect various expansion cards, such\n> as graphics cards, network interface cards, and storage controllers.\n> However, there are some differences in the PCIe bus architecture between\n> these two server models.\n>\n> The Dell PowerEdge R720 supports up to eight PCIe 3.0 slots with a maximum\n> bandwidth of 8 GT/s per lane. The server has a total of 40 PCIe lanes\n> available for expansion cards. The R720 also supports the use of mezzanine\n> cards, which are smaller expansion cards that can be mounted directly onto\n> the motherboard.\n>\n> On the other hand, the Dell PowerEdge R730 supports up to twelve PCIe 3.0\n> slots with a maximum bandwidth of 8 GT/s per lane. The server has a total of\n> 64 PCIe lanes available for expansion cards. The R730 also introduces\n> support for PCIe Gen 3 x16 slot, which provides higher bandwidth than the\n> previous generation.\n>\n> In summary, while both servers use PCIe 3.0 slots with similar maximum\n> bandwidth per lane, the R730 supports more PCIe lanes and slots compared to\n> the R720. Additionally, the R730 introduces support for a higher bandwidth\n> PCIe Gen 3 x16 slot, which is not available on the R720. These differences\n> can affect the overall performance and expandability of the server depending\n> on the specific workload requirements and expansion cards being used.\n>\n> Mixtral24\n\n### Poweredge R730\n\n  * Really struggled this time to get ollama, you can see in the history (setup) below\n\nsetupDownload\n\nthis is all you should need. starting point: fresh kubuntu install.\n\n  * sudo apt install nvtop\n  * nvtop # you will see no gpus probably\n  * sudo ubuntu-drivers \u2013gpgpu install\n  * sudo shutdown -r\n  * ...\n  * nvtop # hopefully you see gpus!\n  * # install ollama (hopefully seemless for you)\n  * # looking at vllm next\n\n### Nvidia Tesla T40 16gb\n\nI\u2019m spending more than i\u2019d like on these but I think the power savings will be\nworth it in the \u201cTotal Cost of Ownership\u201d (TCO).
