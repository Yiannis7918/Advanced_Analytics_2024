I even have a quotation in it, about\nhow I\u2019m sometimes freaked out by how optimistic I feel about things, at least\neconomically.\n\nI\u2019d be lying if I said that reading that line in the paper of record didn\u2019t\nmake my stomach do a flip or two. I\u2019m superstitious on the best day, and I\nfeel baseline uneasy about any positive outlook I might have for the US or\nworld economy at large. My mind may have even flashed to Gob Bluth saying over\nand over again, \u201cI\u2019ve made a huge mistake\u201d as I saw bemused reactions to the\npiece on social media: \u201cso ... uh... what makes this time different?\u201d \u201cjust\nwait for that Minsky moment!\u201d \u201cthese economists really think crises are over?\u201d\n\nSo, some clarification. First of all, read the piece! No one thinks the\neconomy is immune from external shocks; I certainly don\u2019t. When economists and\nanalysts discuss the possibility of a softening business cycle, what we\u2019re\ntalking about is what happens after the shock. There\u2019s also nothing saying\nthat business interests won\u2019t somehow bring about a recession of their own\nvolition; I have many ambivalent feelings about crypto and other asset\nbubbles, and I was on tenterhooks for the duration of the Silicon Valley Bank\nfiasco (about which more later). Here\u2019s what I feel optimistic about: in\ncontrast with 2008, the US\u2019s federal government and the Federal Reserve\ntogether mobilized lots of spending, massive liquidity provision, and novel\nmethods of stabilizing volatile asset markets to prevent fears about the\ndomestic and global economy from bringing about those feared changes. Solidly\nmainstream economists have discussed how their fears that expanded\nunemployment insurance might tank labor markets after the pandemic have\npublicly announced their errors, and recommended that policy makers consider\nsimilar measures next time around. Even the fickle Fed, which spent more than\na year raising rates and likely helping cause instability for a bunch of mid-\nsize banks continued to provide ample support for banks and international\ncentral banks (a selection of them, anyway) worried about their solvency in\nthe days and weeks after SVB\u2019s failure.\n\nIf we compare these responses with government and Fed responses to the 2008\nGlobal Financial Crisis, there\u2019s a wide gulf. The scope and the range of the\nFed\u2019s responses to crises since 2008 dwarfs that earlier response, which was,\nitself, remarkable at the time. The federal government\u2019s interventions have\nsupported households, small businesses and banks, and large businesses and\nbanks. As mentioned, mainstream economists that I \u2018did not have on my bingo\ncard\u2019 came out, on the record, in support of expanded unemployment insurance,\nand have levied more than fair criticism of the support that went to firms who\ndid not, um, use the funds for what they said they would. And to anyone\nsmirking about Minsky moments, it would be worthwhile to remember Mike Beggs\u2019s\nalways germane writing about those moments, and the fact that the Minsky\nMoment is the rescue, rather than the crisis itself.\n\nThere\u2019s also the point Talmon Smith makes about the makeup of the US economy,\nand the sheer mechanics of spending and GDP and what translates as a\nrecession. We all observed the massive decrease in spending in March and April\nof 2020, and then almost immediately, there was a big rebound in all kinds of\nspending. Many firms in the service industries \u2013 coffee shops, restaurants \u2013\nand other retailers figured out how to make the remote commerce thing work.\nPurchase of goods from online retailers boomed past anyone\u2019s imagination.\nLarge swathes of unemployment payments allowed furloughed waitstaff and other\nworkers to keep spending. All of this contributed to the recession being two\nmonths. Two months! It took a while for consumption to reach its pre-March\ntrajectory, but it\u2019s incredible that we\u2019ve actually rejoined our pre-2008\ntrajectory as other sectors of the economy have rebounded. I\u2019m always struck\nby this when I walk through US GDP data with my macro students, and I do it a\nbunch of times each semester.\n\nSomething that didn\u2019t make it into the piece that I think is really important\nis that while I think it is excellent that policy makers are quick to use\nthese tools during crises, I wish that policy makers in the government and at\nthe Fed were more sanguine about deploying these tools for the social benefits\nthat would follow outside of crises. Jamie Galbraith is right that we\nshouldn\u2019t dismiss perceptions that the economy is not perfect for everyone,\neven if many metrics, like wages for the lowest income brackets, have shown\nhuge improvement since 2020. I\u2019d like the Fed to make dollar swap lines\navailable to way more economies\u2019 central banks. The end of the Child Taxcare\nCredit was a huge policy failure. I want more targeted credit facilities, and\nI\u2019d really like the Federal Reserve to do something about liquidity risks\nlikely to flow from climate change. I think that subsidies for housing,\neducation, and more should be constant phenomena. I also think that a uniform\nand federally administered unemployment insurance system would be a gargantuan\nimprovement over the US\u2019s state-level hodgepodge of systems that range from\nthe overtaxed and slow to the frankly awful, before we can move on to\nexpanding unemployment payments more generously as a baseline. I also think\nthat we should raise corporate taxes and minimum wages, pass more union\nfriendly legislation, increase all manner of social benefits and on and on.\n\nUltimately, none of this is mutually exclusive with my being more optimistic\nabout the potential for the US government to respond to economic crises in\nways that lessen the long-term hardship created by the initial recession. We\nshould have more debt relief for students, and lower tuition levels for public\neducation in any event. We should have more unemployment for people, whether\nwe\u2019re in a once-in-a-century pandemic or not. We should have more policies\nthat have been proven to shrink the poverty rate (which should, itself, be\nrecalculated to better serve households across the country). At the same time,\nit\u2019s a very good thing to be able to count on a government to do more to\nsupport its population. What really freaks me out is the prospect of losing a\ngovernment that thinks that this is a good thing, on net. But that\u2019s another\nstory!\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### Related\n\nIndustrial Policy, Hamilton and Deese, and Odd Lots and Shift KeyMarch 24,\n2024In \"alexander-hamilton\"\n\nOn that lunch with Lloyd Blankfein pieceFebruary 22, 2020\n\nSome things I\u2019ve written in April and May, 2020:May 30, 2020\n\nPosted on April 12, 2024Author ninaephdTags business-cycles, economy, federal-\nreserve, new-york-times, policy\n\n### Leave a comment Cancel reply\n\nPowered by WordPress.com.\n\n  * Comment\n  * Reblog\n  * Subscribe Subscribed\n\n    * Nina Quinn Eichacker\n    * Already have a WordPress.com account?
