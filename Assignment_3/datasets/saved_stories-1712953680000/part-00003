Say that again.\n\nTraditional (boring) 24-hour days: out. Modern (revolutionary) 26-hour days:\nin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bizarre plan, promoted by a local town mayor in the Arctic Circle near the\nRussian border, aims to boost local values, increase family time and attract\nnew residents to the region. All nice ideas, but in practice, the details\nremain at best fuzzy.\n\nIn its letter to the European Commission \u2014 which confirmed that it has\nreceived the request \u2014 the region is asking the EU body to instruct Norwegian\nauthorities to approve the creation of a time zone with 26-hour days instead\nof 24-hour days.\n\nHow would the new time zones work in practice? Wenche Pedersen, the mayor of\nVads\u00f8 who authored the letter, is unsure.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t thought a lot about that\u201d she said. \u201cThe clock will go from 12 to\n13... and we have to see how this will go. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to say\nyes so we haven\u2019t thought about all the details.\u201d\n\nRight.\n\nAccording to Pedersen, the region has been struggling to attract new\nresidents. But the mayor is hoping this will change by showcasing the area\u2019s\nunique values.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThrough our \u2018MOREtime\u2019 project, we aim to celebrate and promote this unique\nway of life, offering individuals the opportunity to enjoy more quality time\nengaging in activities such as fishing, hunting, learning new languages, or\nsimply being with loved ones,\u201d Vads\u00f8 said in a letter.\n\n\u201cWhat is the good thing about living here? It\u2019s the time,\u201d she told POLITICO.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t run after the buses or after the trains or have to take a long time\nto travel to work and so on,\u201d she added. \u201cWe are very satisfied with living in\na part of Norway where we have more time to be with our friends, with our\nfamily and together.\u201d\n\nBy extending the length of the days, Pedersen hopes that more people will be\ninspired to move to the remote region. Ensuring that the area is populated is\n\u201cmore important than ever\u201d in light of Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine, Pedersen\nadded.\n\n\u201cWe like our lifestyle and we think that could be very exciting, especially\nfor families with small children,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a more calm\nand better everyday life than for example in a big city.\u201d\n\nCould it actually happen?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNorway is not an EU member, but the country is part of the European Economic\nArea (EEA). While a EU directive regulates summer time arrangements, whether\nit has authority over creating separate time zones is another question.\n\nAccording to a Commission official, time zones are a matter for countries\nthemselves, so it\u2019s unlikely that the EU will be able to grant the region\u2019s\nrequest.\n\nNevertheless, Pedersen is hoping to at least spread the word about the\nuniqueness of northern Norway.\n\n\u201cIn this respect we are one of the richest regions in Europe because [...] we\nhave more time,\u201d Pedersen said.\n\nRelated Countries\n\nNorway\n\n## Our readers read next\n\n## Starmer \u2018fully confident\u2019 Angela Rayner will be cleared by police\ninvestigation into tax row\n\n50 MINS ago 2 mins read\n\n## Belgium opens probe into pro-Russia network accused of paying MEPs\n\n2 HRS ago 2 mins read\n\n## German minister threatens \u2018indefinite driving bans\u2019 on weekends\n\n3 HRS ago 3 mins read\n\n## Social media is a threat to the French language, says France\u2019s PM\n\n4 HRS ago 2 mins read\n\n## More from Claudia Chiappa\n\n## Unlikely allies Viktor Orb\u00e1n and Donald Tusk rail against EU migration deal\n\nSurprising bedfellows criticized the pact, which has been in the works for\nyears.\n\nApr 11 2 mins read\n\n## EU court removes Russian oligarchs Fridman, Aven from sanctions list\n\nThe two businessmen were sanctioned over Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.\n\nApr 10 2 mins read\n\n## 6 countries move to protect the North Sea from Russians\n\nPotential foreign sabotage and attacks on critical infrastructure set off\nalarms.\n\nApr 9 2 mins read\n\n## Bulgaria appoints caretaker government with Dimitar Glavchev as new PM\n\nThe country will hold a snap parliamentary election on June 9 \u2014 the same day\nas the European election.\n\nApr 9 2 mins read\n\n", "frontpage": false}
