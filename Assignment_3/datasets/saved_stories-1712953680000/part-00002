This short article is a\ncollection of links to Windows and Microsoft code.\n\n## Leaked Windows Source Code\n\nLinks to leaked Windows source files:\n\n  * Windows XP (NT5) https://github.com/cryptoAlgorithm/nt5src\n  * Windows NT4 https://github.com/ZoloZiak/WinNT4\n  * Windows 2000 https://github.com/pustladi/Windows-2000\n  * Windows Research Kit https://github.com/Zer0Mem0ry/ntoskrnl\n\n## Official Microsoft Published Source Code\n\nMicrosoft has recently become significantly more Open Source oriented, and has\neven started actively developing Open Source projects and publishing some of\nits own code. Links to published Microsoft code:\n\n  * Microsoft .NET source https://referencesource.microsoft.com/\n  * Microsoft\u2019s Github https://github.com/Microsoft\n\n## Other Resources\n\nOther resources to help you with your Windows and Microsoft adventures:\n\n  * ReactOS - An Open Source OS implementing Window\u2019s API and functionality\n  * Windows Internals Book - Published by Microsoft Press, this book describes Window\u2019s internal mechanisms\n\n## A Note On Lost Source Code\n\nManaging a giant code base (and the corresponding compilation tool chain) is a\ndifficult task that gets harder as the code grows and ages, so it is not\nunexpected that Microsoft, a software giant founded over 40 years ago,\noccasionally misplaces a file or loses the ability to compile it. This is\nexactly what happened with the Microsoft Office Equation Editor\u2019s code.\n\nCVE-2017-11882 is a vulnerability in the Equation Editor in Microsoft Office\nthat could be exploited by an attacker to run malicious code on a victim\u2019s\ncomputer when the victim opens a malicious Word document. Microsoft typically\nfixes these vulnerabilities by updating the source code, recompiling it, and\nthen publishing a new executable file with the fix. However, this was not the\ncase with the Equation Editor: instead, it seems Microsoft has lost its source\ncode (or ability to compile it) and opted to directly patch the assembly of\nthe executable file!\n\nDirectly patching the assembly proved to be unsustainable \u2013 as new\nvulnerabilities in the Equation Editor were surfaced by security researchers,\nMicrosoft eventually disabled the Equation Editor completely.\n\nIn conclusion, it\u2019s entirely possible that the source code for the module\nyou\u2019re researching, something you dream of attaining, is the same dream of a\nMicrosoft engineer. Think about that. It\u2019s beautiful how common struggles\nconnect people \ud83d\udc98\n\nRead more about the Equation Editor vulnerability here and here\n\n  * Tags\n  * C/C++\n\n  * Reverse Engineering\n\nPrevious post\n\nHow I Compile Reverse Engineering Exercises For Maximum Learning And Minimum\nNoise\n\nNext post\n\nMav's 30 Reverse Engineering Tips & Tricks\n\n2023 Mav Levin All Rights Reserved.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
