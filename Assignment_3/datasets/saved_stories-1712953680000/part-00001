Wayt Gibbs\n\n16 hours ago\n\n6 min read\n\nCaltech\u2019s SSPD-1 [shown here in an artist's conception] has been testing the\nfeasibility of beaming solar energy from space to Earth\u2019s surface.\n\nCaltech\n\nsolar power power beaming space space based solar caltech\n\nThe idea of powering civilization from gigantic solar plants in orbit is older\nthan any space program, but despite seven decades of rocket science, the\nconcept\u2014to gather near-constant sunlight tens of thousands of kilometers above\nthe equator, beam it to Earth as microwaves, and convert it to\nelectricity\u2014still remains tantalizingly over the horizon. Several recently\npublished deep-dive analyses commissioned by NASA and the European Space\nAgency have thrown cold water on the hope that space solar power could\naffordably generate many gigawatts of clean energy in the near future. And yet\nthe dream lives on.\n\nThe dream achieved a kind of lift-off in January 2023. That\u2019s when SSPD-1, a\nsolar space-power demonstrator satellite carrying a bevy of new technologies\ndesigned at the California Institute of Technology, blasted into low Earth\norbit for a year-long mission. Mindful of concerns about the technical\nfeasibility of robotic in-space assembly of satellites, each an order of\nmagnitude larger than the International Space Station, the Caltech team has\nbeen looking at very different approaches to space solar power.\n\nFor an update on what the SSPD-1 mission achieved and how it will shape future\nconcepts for space solar-power satellites, IEEE Spectrum spoke with Ali\nHajimiri, an IEEE Fellow, professor of electrical engineering at Caltech, and\ncodirector of the school\u2019s space-based solar power project. The interview has\nbeen condensed and edited for length and clarity.\n\nSSPD-1 flew with several different testbeds. Let\u2019s start with the MAPLE\n(Microwave Array for Power-transfer Low-orbit Experiment) testbed for wireless\npower transmission: When you and your team went up on the roof of your\nbuilding on campus in May 2023 and aimed your antennas to where the satellite\nwas passing over, did your equipment pick up actual power being beamed down or\njust a diagnostic signal?\n\nAli Hajimiri: I would call it a detection. The primary purpose of the MAPLE\nexperiment was to demonstrate wireless energy transfer in space using\nflexible, lightweight structures and also standard CMOS integrated circuits.\nOn one side are the antennas that transmit the power, and on the flip side are\nour custom CMOS chips that are part of the power-transfer electronics. The\npoint of these things is to be very lightweight, to reduce the cost of launch\ninto space, and to be very flexible for storage and deployment, because we\nwant to wrap it and unwrap it like a sail.\n\nAli Hajimiri is the codirector of Caltech\u2019s space-based solar power\nproject.Caltech\n\nI see\u2014wrap them up to fit inside a rocket and then unwrap and stretch them\nflat once they are released into orbit.\n\nHajimiri: MAPLE\u2019s primary objective was to demonstrate that these flimsy-\nlooking arrays and CMOS integrated circuits can operate in space. And not only\nthat, but that they can steer wireless energy transfer to different targets in\nspace, different receivers. And by energy transfer I mean net power out at the\nreceiver side. We did demonstrate power transfer in space, and we made a lot\nof measurements. We are writing up the details now and will publish those\nresults.\n\nThe second part of this experiment\u2014really a stretch goal\u2014was to demonstrate\nthat ability to point the beam to the right place on Earth and see whether we\npicked up the expected power levels. Now, the larger the transmission array is\nin space, the greater the ability to focus the energy to a smaller spot on the\nground.\n\nRight, because diffraction of the beam limits the size of the spot, as a\nfunction of the transmitter size and the frequency of the microwaves.\n\nHajimiri: Yes. The array we had in space for MAPLE was very small. As a\nresult, the transmitter spread the power over a very large area. So we\ncaptured a very small fraction of the energy\u2014that\u2019s why I call it a detection;\nit was not net positive power. But we measured it. We wanted to see: Do we get\nwhat we predict from our calculations? And we found it was in the right range\nof power levels we expected from an experiment like that.\n\nSo, comparable in power to the signals that come down in standard\ncommunication satellite operations.\n\nHajimiri: But done using this flexible, lightweight system\u2014that\u2019s what makes\nit better. You can imagine developing the next generation of communication\nsatellites or space-based sensors being built with these to make the system\nsignificantly cheaper and lighter and easier to deploy. The satellites used\nnow for Starlink and Kuiper\u2014they work great, but they are bulky and heavy.\nWith this technology for the next generation, you could deploy hundreds of\nthem with a very small and much cheaper launch. It could lead to a much more\neffective Internet in the sky.\n\nTell me about ALBA, the experiment on the mission that tested 32 different and\nnovel kinds of photovoltaic solar cells to see how they perform in space. What\nwere the key takeaways?\n\nHajimiri: My Caltech colleague Harry Atwater led that experiment. What works\nbest on Earth is not necessarily what works best in space. In space there is a\nlot of radiation damage, and they were able to measure degradation rates over\nmonths. On the other hand, there is no water vapor in space, no air oxidation,\nwhich is good for materials like perovskites that have problems with those\nthings. So Harry and his team are exploring the trade-offs and developing a\nlot of new cells that are much cheaper and lighter: Cells made with thin films\nof perovskites or semiconductors like gallium arsenide, cells that use quantum\ndots, or use waveguides or other optics to concentrate the light. Many of\nthese cells show very large promise. Very thin layers of gallium arsenide, in\nparticular, seem very conducive to making cells that are lightweight but very\nhigh performance and much lower in cost because they need very little\nsemiconductor material.\n\nMany of the design concepts for solar-power satellites, including one your\ngroup published in a 2022 preprint, incorporate concentrators to reduce the\namount of photovoltaic area and mass needed.\n\nHajimiri: A challenge with that design is the rather narrow acceptance angle:\nThings have to be aligned just right so that the focused sunlight hits the\ncell properly. That\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019ve pulled away from that approach\nand moved toward a flat design.\n\nA view from inside MAPLE: On the right is the array of flexible microwave\npower transmitters, and on the left are receivers they transmit that power\nto.Caltech\n\nThere are some other major differences between the Caltech power satellite\ndesign and the other concepts out there. For example, the other designs I\u2019ve\nseen would use microwaves in the Wi-Fi range, between 2 and 6 gigahertz,\nbecause cheap components are available for those frequencies. But yours is at\n10 GHz?\n\nHajimiri: Exactly\u2014and it\u2019s a major advantage because when you double the\nfrequency, the size of the systems in space and on the ground go down by a\nfactor of four. We can do that basically because we build our own microchips\nand have a lot of capabilities in millimeter-wave circuit design. We\u2019ve\nactually demonstrated some of these flexible panels that work at 28 GHz.\n\nAnd your design avoids the need for robots to do major assembly of components\nin space?\n\nHajimiri: Our idea is to deploy a fleet of these sail-like structures that\nthen all fly in close formation. They are not attached to each other. That\ntranslates to a major cost reduction. Each one of them has little thrusters on\nthe edges, and it contains internal sensors that let it measure its own shape\nas it flies and then correct the phase of its transmission accordingly. Each\nwould also track its own position relative to the neighbors and its angle to\nthe sun.\n\nFrom your perspective as an electrical engineer, what are the really hard\nproblems still to be solved?\n\nHajimiri: Time synchronization between all parts of the transmitter array is\nincredibly crucial and one of the most interesting challenges for the future.\n\nBecause the transmitter is a phased array, each of the million little antennas\nin the array has to synchronize precisely with the phase of its neighbors in\norder to steer the beam onto the receiver station on the ground.\n\nHajimiri: Right. To give you a sense of the level of timing precision that we\nneed across an array like this: We have to reduce phase noise and timing\njitter to just a few picoseconds across the entire kilometer-wide transmitter.\nIn the lab, we do that with wires of precise length or optical fibers that\nfeed into CMOS chips with photodiodes built into them. We have some ideas\nabout how to do that wirelessly, but we have no delusions: This is a long\njourney.\n\nWhat other challenges loom large?\n\nHajimiri: The enormous scale of the system and the new manufacturing\ninfrastructure needed to make it is very different from anything humanity has\never built. If I were to rank the challenges, I would put getting the will,\nresources, and mindshare behind a project of this magnitude as number one.\n\nFrom Your Site Articles\n\n  * How Japan Plans to Build an Orbital Solar Farm \u203a\n  * Caltech Tests Space-Based Solar Power \u203a\n\nRelated Articles Around the Web\n\n  * New Study Updates NASA on Space-Based Solar Power - NASA \u203a\n  * Space-based solar power - Wikipedia \u203a\n\nsolar powerpower beamingspacespace based solarcaltech\n\n{\"imageShortcodeIds\":[]}\n\nW.
