So\nI purchased the Levitouch Dual-Arm Monitor Mount from Gabor to get more desk\nspace by removing two large monitor stands. The Levitouch supports two\nmonitors and moves each in four axes: rotation, tilt, swivel and pivot.\n\nHere\u2019s my review.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nI came late to the VESA party, so this is my first VESA mount. I discovered\nthat I like this Levitouch from Gabor a lot. It is solidly built, easy to\nassemble... ahem, if you read all the directions before you start \u2013 and\nsupports two computer monitors from 17 \u2013 32\u2032\u2032 and up to 19.8 pounds each.\n\nNOTE: VESA (Video Electronics Standards Association) standards are\nmeasurements for the distance between mounting holes at the back of flat-\nscreen TVs, monitors, and other flat-panel displays. There are three\nstandards: 75 x 75 mm, 100 x 100mm and 200 x 200 mm, however following the\nVESA mounting standards is voluntary for manufacturers.\n\nAssembly takes about fifteen minutes and uses industry-standard VESA mounts\nand bolts, which are supplied. Monitors can be moved up or down, pivoted left\nor right, tilted up or down and rotated from horizontal to vertical.\n\nIt can be attached to a desk via a clamp (more on that below), an existing\ncable port in the desktop or drilling a small, 3/8\u2032\u2032 (10mm) hole to mount the\nmain support plate to the desktop.\n\nThe monitor support arms include adjustable spring-steel tensions, so that\nmonitors will move easily and stay put once you stop pushing. Each arm is\nindependently adjustable, so your monitors don\u2019t need to match for size,\nweight, or orientation.\n\nThe mounts support:\n\n  * \u00b140\u00b0 Tilt\n  * 360\u00b0 Swivel (can be limited to 180\u00b0 so you don\u2019t bang into the wall)\n  * \u00b1180\u00b0 Pivot\n  * \u00b1180\u00b0 Rotation\n\nI\u2019ve only owned this device for a couple of days, but I am already enjoying\nmore desk space, better monitor positioning and the security of knowing these\nsupports will last for a long, long time.\n\nIf you are looking to add positioning flexibility to a dual-monitor setup, I\nhighly recommend the Levitouch Dual-Arm Monitor Mount from Gabor.\n\nManufacturer: Gabor Product: DM-552 Levitouch Dual-Arm Monitor Mount Website:\nDM-552 Dual Monitor Mount Price: $142.99 (US) ($110 at B&H)\n\nNOTE: Here\u2019s the single arm version, also available at a discount through B&H.\n\nPACKAGING\n\nThe unit arrives nicely packed in cardboard, with all pieces wrapped and\nlabeled in plastic bags.\n\n(Click to see larger image. Courtesy: Gabor User Manual.)\n\nWhat I especially liked was the quality of the assembly instructions. Clear\ndrawings, readable English and mostly accurate.\n\nNOTE: These instructions referred to the VESA plate being separate from the\nmounting bracket but, for this model, they are attached.\n\nAssembly is easy \u2013 but, I made the mistake of assembling this without reading\nthe directions. No harm was caused, but I wasted ten minutes because I was too\nproud to actually read the directions before I started. When you do, the\ndirections are clear and easy to follow. You\u2019ll need a Phillips screwdriver.\n\nASSEMBLY\n\nThe KEY decision you need to make is whether to clamp it to your desk, or\ndrill a small 3/8\u2032\u2032 hole in your desktop to mount it using a grommet. (Gabor\nsupplies mounting hardware for both in the box.)\n\nAs the screen shot above shows, you need a minimum of 1.5\u2032\u2032 for the clamp to\nbe securely attached to your desk. The ideal amount is 2.5\u2032\u2032. For my \u201ctest\ndesk,\u201d I only had a one inch overhang and, while that was enough to take\nphotos, it is not enough for actual use. The desk I will be using has 6\u2032\u2032 of\noverhang, so I\u2019m fine. But, if you only have an inch, as my test desk does,\nyou\u2019ll need to drill a hole in the desktop to make this safe and secure.\n\nOnce the clamp is secure, you\u2019ll add two swivel arms, then two more arms that\nactually hold the monitor. These are made out of steel and feel very solid and\nwell-built.\n\nEach monitor arm holds a steel spring whose tension is adjustable to\ncompensate for the weight of each monitor. Each arm is individually adjustable\nfor tension and position.\n\nThe back of virtually every computer monitor and TV made for the last decade\nor so has bolt holes for a VESA mount. The Levitouch supports both 75 x 75 and\n100 x 100 spacings.\n\nBolts to attach the mount to the monitor are supplied. Another nice feature is\nthat monitors can be quickly released from the arms, simply by twisting the\nthumb knob at the top of the mount. The two screws (red arrows) adjust\nrotation tension. As shipped, these are too tight to rotate the monitor and\nneed to be loosened.\n\nNOTE: Another benefit to the \u201cquick-release\u201d thumb lock at the top is that it\nis very easy to remove or replace a monitor without having to undo any of the\nmount from the desktop. As someone who likes to test different monitors, I\nlike this feature a lot.\n\nCable runs are built into the unit for both power and data. As well, the base\nplate has slots to hold the two hex (Allen) wrenches.\n\nOPERATION\n\nOnce everything is set up and monitors are attached \u2013 again, the whole process\ntook me 15 minutes \u2013 the last adjustment you need to make is tweaking the\nspring tension adjustments so that the monitor doesn\u2019t move once you set it\ninto position.\n\nThis involves twisting a bolt with a (supplied) Allen wrench until the monitor\nmoves easily in all directions. There\u2019s an indicator on the spring showing how\nmuch tension is applied.\n\nNOTE: There\u2019s also a set screw in the base to prevent it from swiveling so far\nthat the monitor bangs into the wall.\n\nOnce this tension adjustment is made, you are good to go. No additional\nmaintenance is required unless you change monitors and need to rebalance the\nsprings.\n\nAs I get ready to put this dual monitor mounting system into production, I\nfind myself getting excited about how this offers the opportunity combine both\nhorizontal and vertical monitor layouts and vary them on a whim. For example,\nI could display the file list (Browser or Project Monitor) on a vertical\nmonitor, while editing on a horizontal monitor. I suspect I\u2019ll play with this\nfeature more than I expect.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nClearly, if you only need to support one monitor, this unit is more than you\nneed. However, Gabor makes a variety of monitor mounts and, if they are all as\nwell built as this, you have a variety of excellent choices.\n\nI find the positioning flexibility of these mounts opens my imagination to the\ncreative freedom and efficiency of varying monitor position and orientation.\nFor example, a vertical monitor may be preferable for writing, spreadsheets,\nlists; even audio mixing and editing vertical video for social media. A\nhorizontal monitor may be preferable for traditional video editing and slide\npresentations. The ability to alter monitor position and orientation quickly\nand easily is an option I\u2019ve never had before.\n\nI\u2019m truly impressed with how well-built and flexible these are. I\u2019m also\nimpressed by the thoughtfulness of the design. Little things like places to\nstore tools, a set screw to limit hitting the monitor against the wall, built-\nin cable runs, the ease of adjusting spring tension and four axes of rotation\ncome immediately to mind.\n\nNow that my photos are done for this review, I can move all the stuff off my\nmain desk and get these permanently installed. I\u2019m looking forward to using\nthese Gabor Monitor Mounts for years to come.\n\nBookmark the permalink.\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\n# Larry Recommends:\n\nNEW & Updated!\n\nEdit smarter with Larry\u2019s latest training, all available in our store.\n\nAccess over 1,900 on-demand video editing courses.
