All of them said yes.\n\nI\u2019ve asked my favorite authors if, when they\u2019re done writing a new book, they\nfeel it was the best book ever. All of them said no.\n\nI don\u2019t know why the two groups are so different. Do you? (Please post your\nthoughts, below, if so.)\n\nAs for me? I think the best book ever written is \u201cHow to Live\u201d.\n\nIf I did nothing else with my life but write that book, it would have been a\nworthy life. It\u2019s not ego. It\u2019s not that I think I\u2019m so special. But that book\nis definitely something very special.\n\nI spent thousands of hours writing everything I ever learned, from the 400+\nbooks I\u2019ve read, and the 50+ years I\u2019ve lived. Rough draft: over 1300 pages.\n\nThen I spent thousands of hours editing it down to 112 poetic pages. Not a\nsingle unnecessary word.\n\nEvery now and then, I hear someone quote it. When they do, I think it\u2019s the\nmost beautiful quote I\u2019ve ever heard. Then I remember I wrote it.\n\nI feel I\u2019m not supposed to admit all of this. But it\u2019s honest.\n\nWhy don\u2019t more writers feel this way?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Derek Sivers.\n\n# Copy & share: sive.rs/htl00\n\n", "frontpage": true}
