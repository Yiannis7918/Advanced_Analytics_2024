Subscribers get:\n\n  * An anonymous VPN built for speed, security, and simplicity. Secure your connection anytime, anywhere, on up to five devices simultaneously.\n  * Personal Information Removal, which finds and removes personal details \u2013 like your name and home address \u2013 from data broker sites that store and sell them, helping to combat identity theft and spam.\n  * Identity Theft Restoration. If your identity is stolen, a dedicated advisor will help restore stolen accounts, assist in recovering resulting financial losses, and help correct your credit report.\n\nGetting these services separately from other companies could cost upwards of\n$30/month; our users can subscribe to Privacy Pro for $9.99/month or\n$99.99/year. Privacy Pro is currently only available to United States\nresidents, but we plan on expanding to other regions in the future. Sign up at\nduckduckgo.com/pro and make sure you're using the most up-to-date version of\nthe DuckDuckGo browser on all your devices.\n\n### What is Privacy Pro?\n\nEvery day, tens of millions of people rely on DuckDuckGo to add a layer of\nprivacy to their online activities. The centerpiece of our product offering is\nnow the DuckDuckGo browser, which offers the most comprehensive set of free\nprivacy protections by default. (One immediate benefit? Fewer ads and popups\nthan you\u2019d see on other browsers.) Our browser bundles our private search\nengine, tracker blocking, Email Protection, and more than a dozen other free\nprivacy features in one convenient package. However, there\u2019s only so much\nprotection we can provide for free. For example, some protections, like\nsecuring our users\u2019 network connections with a VPN, require significantly more\nbandwidth and other resources.\n\nEnter Privacy Pro: a three-in-one subscription service that offers even more\nseamless privacy protection. Privacy Pro subscribers get a fast, secure, and\neasy-to-use VPN that doesn\u2019t log your activity; Personal Information Removal,\nwhich helps remove your information from \u201cpeople search\u201d data broker sites\nthat store and sell it; and Identity Theft Restoration, which helps to fix\ncredit report mistakes and recover any resulting financial losses. (Please\nnote: Setting up and managing Personal Information Removal requires a Mac or\nWindows computer.)\n\nOn its own, the DuckDuckGo browser lets you search and browse privately. By\nadding Privacy Pro, you can also limit data brokers\u2019 access to your personal\ninformation and secure your Internet connection across your whole device,\nwhich hides your location and device IP address from sites you visit \u2014 all in\none place.\n\nAdding a Privacy Pro subscription makes the DuckDuckGo browser's best-in-class\nprotections even stronger.\n\n### More protections, same privacy promise.\n\nAt DuckDuckGo, we don\u2019t track you; that\u2019s our privacy policy in a nutshell,\nand this new subscription service is no exception. Guided by the principle of\ndata minimization, we designed Privacy Pro to maximize your privacy:\n\n  * We don\u2019t keep logs of your VPN activity. This means we have no way to tie what you do while connected to the DuckDuckGo VPN to you as an individual \u2014 or to anything else you do on DuckDuckGo, like searching.\n  * Personal Information Removal is the first service of its kind that works directly from your device to keep your sensitive information safe. The details you provide during setup are stored on your device, not on remote servers, and removal requests are initiated directly from that device.\n  * Unlike other data removal services, which take a more scattershot approach, Personal Information Removal only starts opt-out processes with data brokers once we\u2019ve confirmed that they have you in their databases.\n  * Unless you become a victim of identity theft and need help, you don\u2019t need to provide any information for Identity Theft Restoration. It\u2019s waiting for you when you need it.\n  * Payment information is securely handled by Stripe, Google Play, or the Apple App Store, depending on how you sign up. We do not hold or process any of your payment information ourselves.\n  * Instead of a traditional account, we assign you a random ID when you sign up for Privacy Pro. We have no way to connect this random ID back to your payment information.\n\nWe\u2019re here to seamlessly protect your privacy \u2014 not compromise it.\n\nRead the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service for Privacy Pro.\n\n### VPN\n\nOur non-logging VPN secures your Internet connection on up to five devices at\nonce.\n\nGet an extra layer of online protection with the VPN made for speed, security,\nand simplicity \u2014 built and operated by DuckDuckGo, not an outside provider.\nOur VPN encrypts your Internet connection for all your browsers and apps\nacross your entire device, hiding your location and IP address from the sites\nyou visit. Because connections are encrypted, your Internet service provider\n(ISP) can\u2019t see your online traffic either. And we have a strict no-logging\npolicy; we don\u2019t log or store data that can connect you to your online\nactivity, or to any other DuckDuckGo services, such as search.\n\nNo need to install a separate VPN app. Once you sign up for Privacy Pro, you\ncan install our VPN right in your DuckDuckGo browser. After that, you can\nsecure your connection in just one click and check its status at a glance. It\noffers full-device coverage on up to five devices at once.\n\nOur VPN is simple to use. If your VPN connection gets interrupted for any\nreason, it attempts to reconnect automatically and prevents data leaks until\nthe reconnection is successful. And it works perfectly with DuckDuckGo\u2019s other\nprotections; if you\u2019re an Android user, you should know our VPN is the only\none compatible with App Tracking Protection.\n\nWe currently have VPN servers across the US, Europe, and Canada, and we\u2019ll be\nadding more over time. To maximize speed and stability, you\u2019ll connect to the\nclosest available VPN server by default, but you can manually choose whichever\nlocation you prefer.\n\nTo encrypt your traffic and route it through a VPN server, we use the open-\nsource WireGuard protocol, which is fast and secure. We also route your DNS\nqueries automatically through the VPN connection to our own DNS resolvers,\nwhich further hides your browsing history from your ISP.\n\nLearn more about the VPN on our Help Pages.\n\n### Personal Information Removal\n\nPersonal Information Removal helps get your name, address, and more off of\npeople search sites.\n\nEver tried looking yourself up online? Where our other web tracking\nprotections help defend against trackers that gather your personal information\nwhile you browse, Personal Information Removal goes one step further: It works\nto actually remove personal information, such as your name and home address,\nfrom people search sites that store and sell it, helping to combat identity\ntheft and spam.\n\nHow does it work? People search sites, like Spokeo and Verecor, are a common\ntype of data broker. They collect your personal information from local and\nfederal records, public forums like social media, and even other data brokers,\nand make it available online. (You\u2019ve probably seen them in search results\nwhen you look up your name.) We scan dozens of these sites for your info and,\nif found, request its removal, even handling back-and-forth confirmation\nemails for you automatically behind the scenes. Unlike other similar services,\nwe only contact the data brokers once we confirm that you\u2019re in their\ndatabases, and the info you enter for scanning is stored on your device \u2014 not\non remote servers.\n\nTo help us build Personal Information Removal from the ground up while\nmaintaining our strict privacy standards, DuckDuckGo acquired data removal\nservice Removaly in 2022. Removaly was a pioneer in the data removal space,\ndeveloping a way to navigate data brokers\u2019 confusing opt-out process\nautomatically without compromising users\u2019 privacy in the process.\n\nPersonal Information Removal re-scans sites regularly to minimize the risk of\nyour info reappearing, using the data stored on your device. Your device also\ninitiates any removal requests. You can keep tabs on the progress of ongoing\nremovals \u2014 and see the personal information we\u2019ve already removed! \u2014 on your\npersonal dashboard within the DuckDuckGo browser. Once it\u2019s set up, simply\nselect Personal Information Removal from the browser\u2019s three-dot menu in the\nupper right.\n\nYou'll need to set up Personal Information Removal on one primary Mac or\nWindows computer. Right now, the dashboard can only be accessed from that\ndevice, but we are planning to add the ability to view it from your other\ndevices.\n\nLearn more about Personal Information Removal on our Help Pages.\n\n### Identity Theft Restoration\n\nGet some peace of mind: if your identity is ever compromised, Identity Theft\nRestoration is standing by to help.\n\nWith more than 1 million cases a year reported in the U.S., identity theft is\nmore common than you might think. And Personal Information Removal helps\nreduce the chance of identity theft, but unfortunately, nothing can totally\nprevent it. So, let us give you some peace of mind: If your identity is stolen\nor compromised, Identity Theft Restoration will help you handle the stress and\nexpense.\n\nIdentity Theft Restoration is brought to our users in partnership with Iris\u00ae\nPowered by Generali, one of the oldest firms specializing in identity theft in\nthe U.S. Iris\u2019 identity theft advisors are available 24/7, every day of the\nyear, and answer calls within 11 seconds on average.
