As a complete YouTube addict,\nI like sharing video links with a timecode to show stuff to my friends.\nYouTube makes this easy to do on desktop, but for some reason there is no way\nto do it in their app or even on their mobile website.\n\nI made this little tool as a replacement for what YouTube should have done\nyears ago. You can easily add the timecode to whatever video you want, and it\nwill even fetch the thumbnail and title. \ud83d\uddbc\n\nI had wanted to do it for years but never really got to it. Back in 2021, I\nmade some mockups of what the project could have looked like but gave up\nbecause the knob part was too complicated. I still love the idea though and I\nthink it could be handy, especially on mobile where keyboard inputs can be\nannoying. I think I'll try integrating it again eventually!\n\nOriginal mockups for the project, the knob might make a comeback \ud83e\udd14\n\nVisit the live version \u2192\n\n##### \u2728 Enjoying this project? \u2728\n\nPlease share it on social media and tell your friends about it! It helps\nmaking what I do worth it.\n\n\u00a9 2024 by Tahoe Beetschen See the source code\n\nMade in France with \u2764\ufe0f\n\nThanks for passing by!\n\n", "frontpage": false}
