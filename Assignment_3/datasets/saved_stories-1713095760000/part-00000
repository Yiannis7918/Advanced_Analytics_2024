I just want to share a beautiful\nproof of Heron\u2019s formula (or Hero\u2019s formula) with you guys. I didn\u2019t prove\nthis, actually the origin of the proof is unknown. Here it is:\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### Related\n\nBrahmagupta\u2019s formulaApril 11, 2013In \"Mathematics\"\n\nIntegrating Square Root of cos(x) from -pi/2 to pi/2 using beta functionMarch\n26, 2021In \"Mathematics\"\n\nvery first thing you need to learn before going into advanced\nmathematicsNovember 21, 2012In \"Mathematics\"\n\nComments\n\n  1.

It was published in the American Mathematical\nMonthly in December 2007.\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a comment Cancel reply\n\n2012 in review\n\nmost common wrong answer to a typical calculus question\n\nCreate a free website or blog at WordPress.com.\n\n  * Comment\n  * Reblog\n  * Subscribe Subscribed\n\n    * mathgarage\n    * Already have a WordPress.com account?
