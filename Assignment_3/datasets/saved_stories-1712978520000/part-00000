The item that\u2019s getting most of the attention is how much CEO Robert\nIsom makes $31.4 million although that headline number is somewhat misleading.\n\nThere\u2019s no question that Isom is well-compensated compared to the airline\nindustry as a whole (and American financially underperforms) and it\u2019s\nespecially controversial among employees when flight attendants haven\u2019t seen a\nraise since 2019 while first and second-year Boston-based flight attendants\nqualify for food stamps.\n\nBut there\u2019s a lot more in here that matters: Re-election of the Board of\nDirectors; ratification of KPMG as their auditor; non-binding vote on\nexecutive pay; allow amendments to bylaws and certificate of incorporation by\nmajority vote; and a vote on a proposal for third party audit of the airline\u2019s\nESG goals.\n\n## What American Airlines Top Executives Are Paid\n\nHere\u2019s American\u2019s 2023 compensation to named executives. This compensation is\nset by the board, but shareholders get an advisory (non-binding) vote \u2013 an\nopportunity to say whether they think it\u2019s awesome or off base.\n\nAmerican\u2019s officers don\u2019t just receive salary, bonus, and traditional benefits\nlike health and dental. They and their families receive free travel, lounge\naccess and AAdvantage status and they get travel passes to give away as well \u2013\nwith the airline picking up their tax liability for it.\n\n> The positive space flight privileges provided to our officers, including the\n> named executive officers, include unlimited reserved travel in any class of\n> service for the officer and his or her immediate family, including eligible\n> dependent children, for personal purposes. Officers and their immediate\n> families, including eligible dependent children, also have access to our\n> Admirals Club\u00ae travel lounges at various airports and have AAdvantage\n> Executive Platinum status. Officers are also eligible for 12 free round-trip\n> passes or 24 free one-way passes each year for reserved travel for non-\n> eligible family members and friends, and we cover the income tax liability\n> related to these flight privileges. Officers are required to pay any\n> international fees and taxes, if applicable. In addition, each of Messrs.\n> Isom, Johnson and May are vested into the foregoing lifetime travel benefits\n> and are entitled to continued receipt of these benefits upon their\n> termination of employment, other than coverage of income tax liability. Mr.\n> Raja is eligible for lifetime space available travel benefits.\n\nSome top executives at the airline do now have non-competes in their\nemployment agreements, something American was burned by in the past when they\nfired President Scott Kirby, who is now CEO of United and revitalizing that\ncarrier. Isom\u2019s non-compete is for 24 months. Vasu Raja does not have a non-\ncompete.\n\n## Walking Away Money And Other Benefits\n\nIt\u2019s actually interesting what happens if American Airlines were to be\nacquired. Isom gets a $23.8 million payout. Vasu Raja gets $4.2 million in\nthat circumstance, and CFO Devon May gets $3.4 million. Isom gets $23.5\nmillion if the board fires him. If he loses his job becaue of an acqusiiton\n(\u2018change in control\u2019) he gets $31.9 million.\n\nAmerican Airlines covered the costs Isom incurred negotiating against them for\nhis deal. He spent $46,200 on lawyers negotiating his employment deal, and\nAmerican picked up the tab. So much for his admonition not to spend a dollar\nmore than the airline needs to on anything.\n\n## American Sets Its Targets To Reward Executives Too Low\n\nAt the airline\u2019s Media and Investor Day in 2017, then-CEO Doug Parker famously\ndeclared that the airline would \u2018never lose money again.\u2019 His presentation\ndescribed the airline as being like an annuity. They were, effectively, on\nautopilot to earn $3 billion to $7 billion per year and would average $5\nbillion annually into the future. There\u2019s been 20% inflation since then \u2013 just\nsaying even should mean $6 billion!\n\nYet Isom\u2019s compensation package describes $2.5 billion as the airline\u2019s\ntarget, with $4 billion net profit as a home run \u2013 earning him the greatest\npossible bonus. As George W. Bush once said the soft bigotry of low\nexpectations.\n\n## American\u2019s Board Of Directors Doesn\u2019t Hold Executives Accountable\n\nAmerican Airlines board members receive Directors receive $100,000, plus\nadditional compensation for serving on committees, plus $150,000 in stock.\n\nThey also receive complimentary travel for themselves and family members;\npasses to give out; and ConciergeKey status \u2013 and the company covers their tax\nliability for it. Directors earn lifetime flight benefits based on length of\nservice.\n\nTheir job is to set the vision for the company, approve big decisions, and\nhold executives accountable.\n\nDuring the pandemic, then-American CEO Doug Parker told employees that the\nBoard lacked airline experience.\n\n> [O]ur board \u2013 which is a fantastic board \u2013 doesn\u2019t have anyone on the board\n> with airline expertise, that has worked for an airline before. That has an\n> impact on their deliberations and their ability to understand.\n\nHe shared that at the time American brought former Northwest Airlines CEO Doug\nSteenland onto its board. Steenland had been Robert Isom\u2019s boss, and so\npresumably was there to be an ally as Isom prepared to take the reins.\nSteenland serves on American\u2019s compensation committee.\n\nThis is a board that has stuck by management as they\u2019ve alienated\nshareholders, employees and customers.\n\n  * American has made bad investments in other airlines like China Southern (which they wrote down) and Gol (which went into bankruptcy).\n\n  * They lost major partnerships (LATAM to Delta). They lost their major play in New York (to an adverse anti-trust ruling).\n\n  * The carrier no longer talks about taking care of employees so employees take care of customers in order to earn a revenue premium. Instead, the schedule is the product.\n\nCEO Isom\u2019s mantra has been that reliability is what will make the airline\nperform, failing to understand that it\u2019s a baseline \u2013 it isn\u2019t enough.\nAmerican has become far more reliable, but not more profitable. Expenses are\ntoo high to earn money without a revenue premium.\n\nAnd failing strategically to secure its position in the biggest spend markets\nin the country (Northeast and Bay Area/Pacific Northwest), they admitted at\nInvestor Day that they\u2019ve fallen behind both Delta and United in co-brand\ncredit card charge volume when half a dozen years ago they were number one.\n\nThe board sets the vision and direction for the business, and this board\nsimply deferred to Doug Parker who led them down an unprofitable path. As CEO\nof US Airways he cut short American\u2019s bankruptcy process (leaving it less\ncompetitive than peers), overpaid for it in order to become CEO of the world\u2019s\nlargest airline, and left it with unprecedented debt, higher costs, and less\nof an ability to generate revenue from its assets than peers. In other words,\nthe board didn\u2019t do its job.\n\n## Does Robert Isom Deserve This Pay?\n\nCEOs of large public companies are well paid. Many CEOs are paid a lot more.\nAirline CEOs, which tend not to be prized by the market, aren\u2019t among the\nhighest paid in their group.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to assess how much a given CEO is worth. In general, they\ncapture a small amount of the overall value they create. The best ones are\nworth a tremendous amount to shareholders relative to the median person that\nmight fill the role. At the best companies well-compensated CEOs are probably\nunderpaid.\n\nRobert Isom was named the \u2018world\u2019s best airline CEO\u2019 last year so I guess he\u2019s\nworth quite a lot? Of course that list placed the CEO of China Southern in the\ntop 10 \u2013 and American literally wrote down the value of that investment. It\nalso misspelled the name of JetBlue\u2019s CEO and the name of Dubai-based\nEmirates.\n\nSome of reported compensation is a function of \u2018back pay\u2019 that the board feels\nthey owe Isom because he didn\u2019t get raises during the pandemic.\n\nRobert Isom, Vasu Raja, as well as the airline\u2019s CFO and Chief Legal Officer\nwere promoted at a time when the airline was under restrictions as to how much\nthey could compensate their officers. These were contained in the CARES Act,\nbecause it would be unseemly for the government to ultimately give American\napproximately $10 billion and have it go out to executives. But now that those\ntime-based restrictions have lifted, the airline justifies some of their\ncompensation on the basis of not having been able to give it earlier. That\nfeels awkward.\n\nSome of the reported compensation is, effectively, retro pay which is what\nmakes the amount so large and appears larger than what peers receive. The\nstock compensation is also large because he owned less of American than other\nCEOs \u2013 who have been in place longer! \u2013 own of their airlines.\n\nHis salary was \u201cset at a level $1.7 million below the last-reported annual\ntarget compensation of the CEO of Delta.\u201d Delta\u2019s CEO should be making a lot\nmore than American\u2019s CEO, though, given the relative performance of their\nbusinesses.\n\nRobert Isom didn\u2019t really earn $31 million in 2023. He was given a one-time\npayout to account for not having received a raise while the airline couldn\u2019t\ndo so because of the $10 billion in taxpayer money it received. He also\nreceived an unusually large stock grant aimed at bringing him closer to peer\nCEOs in ownership stake in the airline.\n\nBut he probably shouldn\u2019t be paid as much as other CEOs who have performed\nbetter. He shouldn\u2019t (yet) own as much of the airline. And the airline has\nlowered the bar for what is bonusable. Since this is a board that doesn\u2019t hold\nits executives accountable, this shouldn\u2019t be surprising.\n\n## Other Matters\n\nIn meeting and proxy materials, American asks shareholders to approve KPMG as\nits auditor right after a record $25 million for exam cheating by a firm\nleader and two years after a cheating scandal at the firm involving their\nSupervisory Chairman. But that\u2019s probably not worse than activity at other\nlarge accounting firms? And they aren\u2019t going to go with a small shop.\n\nThey want to eliminate supermajority requirements for changes to bylaws and\ncertificate of incorporation, which are meant to protect small shareholders.\n\nAnd the airline recommends rejecting a shareholder proposal to audit their\nprogress on ESG goals, including DEI. The airline did donate $2.5 million last\nyear to former CEO Doug Parker\u2019s foundation which pursues diversity in the\ncockpit. So there\u2019s that. And as for climate, I mean, they\u2019re an airline after\nall.\n\nUltimately, American Airlines remains perhaps the carrier in the world with\nthe greatest potential to be better than it is today. And they\u2019ve set up\ncompensation to top executives like they\u2019ve already achieved it.\n\nRandom Passengers Are Raiding Food From\n\nUnited\u2019s Grab \u2018N Go Lounge In Denver\n\nRead More\n\n86 Shares\n\n27\n\n56\n\n### More From View from the Wing\n\n#### American Airlines CEO: Firing Airline President Scott Kirby \u201cWas One of\nthe Worst Days of My Life\u201d\n\nAt last week's American Airlines employee town hall one flight attendant asked\nCEO Doug Parker whether he regrets American's decision to let airline\nPresident Scott Kirby go and elevate Chief Operating Officer Robert Isom to\nthe role of President.
