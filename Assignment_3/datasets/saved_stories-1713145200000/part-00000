The evidence base\ncould not support the use of such drastic treatments, and this approach was\nfailing to address the complexities of health problems in such children.\n\nMany trans advocacy groups appear to be cautiously welcoming these\nrecommendations. However, there are many who are not and have quickly tried to\ncondemn the review. Within almost hours, \u201cpress releases\u201c, tweets and\ncommentaries tried to rubbish the report and included statements that were\nsimply not true. An angry letter from many \u201cacademics\u201d, including Andrew\nWakefield, has been published. These myths have been subsequently spreading\nlike wildfire.\n\nHere I wish to tackle some of those myths and misrepresentations.\n\n## Myth 1: 98% of all studies in this area were ignored.\n\n### Fact\n\nA comprehensive search was performed for all studies addressing the clinical\nquestions under investigation, and over 100 were discovered. All these studies\nwere evaluated for their quality and risk of bias. Only 2% of the studies met\nthe criteria for the highest quality rating, but all high and medium quality\n(50%+) studies were further analysed to synthesise overall conclusions.\n\n### Explanation.\n\nThe Cass Review aimed to base its recommendations on the comprehensive body of\nevidence available. While individual studies may demonstrate positive outcomes\nfor the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones in children, the\nquality of these studies may vary. Therefore, the review sought to assess not\nonly the findings of each study but also the reliability of those findings.\n\nStudies exhibit variability in quality. Quality impacts the reliability of any\nconclusions that can be drawn. Some may have small sample sizes, while others\nmay involve cohorts that differ from the target patient population. For\ninstance, if a study primarily involves men in their 30s, their experiences\nmay differ significantly from those of teenage girls, who constitute the a\nprimary patient group of interest. Numerous factors can contribute to poor\nstudy quality.\n\nBias is also a big factor. Many people view claims of a biased study as\nmeaning the researchers had ideological or predetermined goals and so might\nmisrepresent their work. That may be true. But that is not what bias means\nwhen we evaluate medical trials.\n\nIn this case we are interested in statistical bias. This is where the numbers\ncan mislead us in some way. For example, if your study started with lots of\npatients but many dropped out then statistical bias may creep in as your drop-\nouts might be the ones with the worst experiences. Your study patients are not\non average like all the possible patients.\n\nIf then we want to look at a lot papers to find out if a treatment works, we\nwant to be sure that we pay much more attention to those papers that look like\nthey may have less risk of bias or quality issues. The poor quality papers may\nhave positive results that are due to poor study design or execution and not\nbecause the treatment works.\n\nThe Cass Review team commissioned researchers at York University to search for\nall relevant papers on childhood use of puberty blockers and cross-sex\nhormones for treating \u201cgender dysphoria\u201d. The researchers then graded each\npaper by established methods to determine quality, and then disregarded all\nlow quality papers to help ensure they did not mislead.\n\nThe Review states,\n\n> The systematic review on interventions to suppress puberty (Taylor et al:\n> Puberty suppression) provides an update to the NICE review (2020a). It\n> identified 50 studies looking at different aspects of gender-related,\n> psychosocial, physiological and cognitive outcomes of puberty suppression.\n> Quality was assessed on a standardised scale. There was one high quality\n> study, 25 moderate quality studies and 24 low quality studies. The low\n> quality studies were excluded from the synthesis of results.\n>\n> Independent review of gender identity services for children and young\n> people: Interim report (the \u201cCass Review\u201d).- https://cass.independent-\n> review.uk/publications/interim-report/\n\nAs can be seen, the conclusions that were based on the synthesis of studies\nonly rejected 24 out of 50 studies \u2013 less than half. The myth has arisen that\nthe synthesis only included the one high quality study. That is simply untrue.\n\nThere were two such literature reviews: the other was for cross-sex hormones.\nThis study found 19 out of 53 studies were low quality and so were not used in\nsynthesis. Only one study was classed as high quality \u2013 the rest medium\nquality and so were used in the analysis.\n\n> 12 cohort, 9 cross-sectional and 32 pre\u2013post studies were included (n=53).\n> One cohort study was high-quality. Other studies were moderate (n=33) and\n> low-quality (n=19). Synthesis of high and moderate-quality studies showed\n> consistent evidence demonstrating induction of puberty, although with\n> varying feminising/masculinising effects. There was limited evidence\n> regarding gender dysphoria, body satisfaction, psychosocial and cognitive\n> outcomes, and fertility.\n>\n> Taylor J, Mitchell A, Hall R, et al Masculinising and feminising hormone\n> interventions for adolescents experiencing gender dysphoria or incongruence:\n> a systematic review Archives of Disease in Childhood Published Online First:\n> 09 April 2024. doi: 10.1136/archdischild-2023-326670\n\nAgain, it is myth that 98% of studies were discarded. The truth is that over a\nhundred studies were read and appraised. About half of them were graded to be\nof too poor quality to reliably include in a synthesis of all the evidence. if\nyou include low quality evidence, your over-all conclusions can be at risk\nfrom results that are very unreliable. As they say \u2013 GIGO \u2013 Garbage In Garbage\nOut.\n\nNonetheless, despite analysing the higher quality studies, there was no clear\nevidence that emerged that puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones were safe\nand effective. The BMJ editorial summed this up perfectly,\n\n> One emerging criticism of the Cass review is that it set the methodological\n> bar too high for research to be included in its analysis and discarded too\n> many studies on the basis of quality. In fact, the reality is different:\n> studies in gender medicine fall woefully short in terms of methodological\n> rigour; the methodological bar for gender medicine studies was set too low,\n> generating research findings that are therefore hard to interpret. The\n> methodological quality of research matters because a drug efficacy study in\n> humans with an inappropriate or no control group is a potential breach of\n> research ethics. Offering treatments without an adequate understanding of\n> benefits and harms is unethical. All of this matters even more when the\n> treatments are not trivial; puberty blockers and hormone therapies are\n> major, life altering interventions. Yet this inconclusive and unacceptable\n> evidence base was used to inform influential clinical guidelines, such as\n> those of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH),\n> which themselves were cascaded into the development of subsequent guidelines\n> internationally.\n>\n> BMJ 2024;385:q837\n\n## Myth 2: Cass recommended no Trans Healthcare for Under 25s.\n\n### Fact\n\nThe Cass Review does not contain any recommendation or suggestion advocating\nfor the withholding of transgender healthcare until the age of 25, nor does it\npropose a prohibition on individuals transitioning.\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis myth appears to be a misreading of one of the recommendations.\n\nThe Cass Review expressed concerns regarding the necessity for children to\ntransition to adult service provision at the age of 18, a critical phase in\ntheir development and potential treatment. Children were deemed particularly\nvulnerable during this period, facing potential discontinuity of care as they\ntransitioned to other clinics and care providers. Furthermore, the transition\nmade follow-up of patients more challenging.\n\nCass then says,\n\n> Taking account of all the above issues, a follow-through service continuing\n> up to age 25 would remove the need for transition at this vulnerable time\n> and benefit both this younger population and the adult population. This will\n> have the added benefit in the longer-term of also increasing the capacity of\n> adult provision across the country as more gender services are established.\n>\n> Cass Review 19.28 p224\n\nCass want to set up continuity of service provision by ensure they remain\nwithin the same clinical setting and with the same care providers until they\nare 25. This says nothing about withdrawing any form of treatment that may be\nappropriate in the adult care pathway. Cass is explicit in saying her report\nis making no recommendations as to what that care should look like for over\n18s.\n\nIt looks the myth has arisen from a bizarre misreading of the phrase \u201cremove\nthe need for transition\u201d. Activists appear to think this means that there\nshould be no \u201cgender transition\u201d whereas it is obvious this is referring to\n\u201ccare transition\u201d.\n\n## Myth 3: Cass is demanding only Double Blind Randomised Controlled Trials be\nused as evidence in \u201cTrans Healthcare\u201d.\n\n### Fact\n\nWhile it is acknowledged that conducting double-blind randomized controlled\ntrials (DBRCT) for puberty blockers in children would present significant\nethical and practical challenges, the Cass Review does not advocate solely for\nthe use of DBRCT trials in making treatment recommendations, nor does it\nmandate that future trials adhere strictly to such protocols. Rather, the\nreview extensively discusses the necessity for appropriate trial designs that\nare both ethical and practical, emphasizing the importance of maintaining high\nmethodological quality.\n\n### Explanation\n\nCass goes into great detail explaining the nature of clinical evidence and how\nthat can vary in quality depending on the trial design and how it is\nimplemented and analysed. She sets out why Double Blind Randomised Controlled\nTrials are the \u2018gold standard\u2019 as they minimise the risks of confounding\nfactors misleading you and helping to understand cause and effect, for\nexample. (See Explanatory Box 1 in the Report).\n\nDoctors rely on evidence to guide treatment decisions, which can be discussed\nwith patients to facilitate informed choices considering the known benefits\nand risks of proposed treatments.\n\nEvidence can range from a doctor\u2019s personal experience to more formal sources.\nFor instance, a doctor may draw on their own extensive experience treating\npatients, known as \u2018Expert Opinion.\u2019 While valuable, this method isn\u2019t\nfoolproof, as historical inaccuracies in medical beliefs have shown.\n\nConsulting other doctors\u2019 experiences, especially if documented in published\ncase reports, can offer additional insight. However, these reports have\nlimitations, such as their inability to establish causality between treatment\nand outcome. For example, if a patient with a bad back improves after\nswimming, it\u2019s uncertain whether swimming directly caused the improvement or\nif the back would have healed naturally.\n\nFurther up the hierarchy of clinical evidence are papers that examine cohorts\nof patients, typically involving multiple case studies with statistical\nanalysis. While offering better evidence, they still have potential biases and\nlimitations.\n\nThis illustrates the \u2018pyramid of clinical evidence,\u2019 which categorises\ndifferent types of evidence based on their quality and reliability in\ninforming treatment decisions\n\nThe above diagram is published in the Cass Review as part of Explanatory Box\n1.\n\nWe can see from the report and papers that Cass did not insist that only\nrandomised controlled trials were used to assess the evidence. The York team\nthat conducted the analyses chose a method to asses the quality of studies\ncalled the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. This is a method best suited for non RCT\ntrials. Cass has selected an assessment method best suited for the nature of\nthe available evidence rather than taken a dogmatic approach on the need for\nDBRCTs. The results of this method were discussed about countering Myth 1.\n\nAs for future studies, Cass makes no demand only DBRCTs are conducted. What is\nhighlighted is at the very least that service providers build a research\ncapacity to fill in the evidence gaps.\n\n> The national infrastructure should be put in place to manage data collection\n> and audit and this should be used to drive continuous quality improvement\n> and research in an active learning environment.\n>\n> Recommendation 18, The Cass Review. p215\n\n## Myth 4: There were less than 10 detransitioners out of 3499 patients in the\nCass study.\n\n### Fact\n\nCass was unable to determine the detransition rate. Although the GIDS audit\nstudy recorded fewer than 10 detransitioners, clinics declined to provide\ninformation to the review that would have enabled linking a child\u2019s treatment\nto their adult outcome. The low recorded rates must be due in part to\ninsufficient data availability.\n\n### Explanation\n\nCass says, \u201cThe percentage of people treated with hormones who subsequently\ndetransition remains unknown due to the lack of long-term follow-up studies,\nalthough there is suggestion that numbers are increasing.\u201d\n\nThe reported number are going to be low for a number of reasons, as Cass\ndescribes:\n\n> Estimates of the percentage of individuals who embark on a medical pathway\n> and subsequently have regrets or detransition are hard to determine from GDC\n> clinic data alone. There are several reasons for this:\n>\n>   * those who do detransition may not choose to return to the gender clinic\n> and are hence lost to follow-up\n>   * the Review has heard from a number of clinicians working in adult gender\n> services that the time to detransition ranges from 5-10 years, so follow-up\n> intervals on studies on medical treatment are too short to capture this\n>   * the inflection point for the increase in presentations to gender\n> services for children and young people was 2014, so even studies with longer\n> follow-up intervals will not capture the outcomes of this more recent\n> cohort.\n>\n\nDamningly, Cass describes the attempt by the review to establish \u201cdata\nlinkage\u2019 between records at the childhood gender clinics and adult services to\nlook at longer term detransition and the clinics refused to cooperate with the\nIndependent Review. The report notes the \u201c...attempts to improve the evidence\nbase have been thwarted by a lack of cooperation from the adult gender\nservices\u201d.\n\nWe know from other analyses of the data on detransitioning that the quality of\ndata is exceptionally poor and the actual rates of detransition and regret are\nunknown. This is especially worrying when older data, such as reported in\nWPATH 7, suggest natural rates of decrease in dysphoria without treatment are\nvery high.\n\n> Gender dysphoria during childhood does not inevitably continue into\n> adulthood. Rather, in follow-up studies of prepubertal children (mainly\n> boys) who were referred to clinics for assessment of gender dysphoria, the\n> dysphoria persisted into adulthood for only 6\u201323% of children.\n>\n> World Professional Association for Transgender Health. (2012). Standards of\n> Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming\n> People [7^th Version]. https://www.wpath.org/publications/soc\n\nThis suggests that active affirmative treatment may be locking in a trans\nidentity into the majority of children who would otherwise desist with trans\nideation and live unmedicated lives.\n\nI shall add more myths as they become spread.\n\n### Related posts:\n\n  1.
