Schiff Introduces Groundbreaking Bill to Create AI Transparency Between\nCreators and Companies\n\nWashington, D.C.\u2014 Today, Representative Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) introduced\ngroundbreaking legislation to require transparency from companies regarding\ntheir use of copyrighted work to train their generative AI models. The\nGenerative AI Copyright Disclosure Act would require a notice to be submitted\nto the Register of Copyrights prior to the release of a new generative AI\nsystem with regard to all copyrighted works used in building or altering the\ntraining dataset for that system. The bill\u2019s requirements would also apply\nretroactively to previously released generative AI systems.\n\n\u201cAI has the disruptive potential of changing our economy, our political\nsystem, and our day-to-day lives. We must balance the immense potential of AI\nwith the crucial need for ethical guidelines and protections. My Generative AI\nCopyright Disclosure Act is a pivotal step in this direction. It champions\ninnovation while safeguarding the rights and contributions of creators,\nensuring they are aware when their work contributes to AI training datasets.\nThis is about respecting creativity in the age of AI and marrying\ntechnological progress with fairness,\u201d said Rep. Schiff.\n\nSchiff\u2019s bill has generated significant support from the creative community.\nSee below:\n\n\u201cAny effective regulatory regime for AI must start with one of the most\nfundamental building blocks of effective enforcement of creators\u2019 rights -\ncomprehensive and transparent recordkeeping. RIAA applauds Congressman Schiff\nfor leading on this urgent and foundational issue,\u201d said Ken Doroshow, Chief\nLegal Officer, Recording Industry Association of America.\n\n\u201cThe Directors Guild of America commends this commonsense legislation, which\nis an important first step toward enabling filmmakers to protect their\nintellectual property from the potential harms caused by generative AI. We\nthank Representative Schiff for championing these rights that will protect\nfilmmakers and the entire creative community,\u201d said Lesli Linka Glatter,\nPresident, DGA.\n\n\u201cProfessional Photographers of America and its 35,000 members strongly support\nthis bill. Photographers are particularly susceptible to having their works\nscraped by generative AI companies, as they must publicly exhibit their best\nwork to attract clients. The urgency of this issue should not be understated\nas copyright holders suffer from the harsh reality of competing with their own\nworks taken by generative AI companies to develop their systems,\u201d said David\nTrust, CEO, Professional Photographers of America.\n\n\u201cEverything generated by AI ultimately originates from a human creative\nsource. That\u2019s why human creative content\u2014intellectual property\u2014must be\nprotected. SAG-AFTRA fully supports the Generative AI Copyright Disclosure\nAct, as this legislation is an important step in ensuring technology serves\npeople and not the other way around,\" said Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, National\nExecutive Director and Chief Negotiator, SAG-AFTRA.\n\n\u201cThis bill is an important first step in addressing the unprecedented and\nunauthorized use of copyrighted materials to train generative AI systems.\nGreater transparency and guardrails around AI are necessary to protect writers\nand other creators,\u201d said Meredith Stiehm, President, Writers Guild of America\nWest.\n\n\u201cThe Generative AI Copyright Disclosure Act is an important piece of\nlegislation that will ensure companies use this new and rapidly advancing\ntechnology in ethical and transparent ways. Given the scope and potential\nthreat of AI, enforceable regulations are urgently needed to keep companies\nfrom implementing this technology in the shadows, without people\u2019s consent or\nknowledge.\u201d said Lisa Takeuchi Cullen, President, Writers Guild of America\nEast.\n\n\u201cWithout transparency around the use of copyrighted works in training\nartificial intelligence, creators will never be fairly compensated and AI tech\ncompanies will continue stealing from songwriters. This bill is an important\nstep toward ensuring that the law puts humans first, and we thank Congressman\nSchiff for his leadership,\u201d said Elizabeth Matthews, CEO, ASCAP.\n\n\u201cThe International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees commends Rep. Adam\nSchiff for introducing the Generative AI Copyright Disclosure Act.\nEntertainment workers must be fairly compensated when their work is used to\ntrain, develop or generate new works by AI systems. This legislation will\nensure there is appropriate transparency of generative AI training sets,\nthereby enabling IATSE workers to enforce their rights,\u201d said Matthew D. Loeb,\nInternational President, IATSE.\n\n\u201cProtecting the work of music creators is essential, and this all begins with\ntransparency and tracking the use of copyrighted materials in generative AI.\nBMAC hopes Rep. Schiff\u2019s Generative AI Copyright Disclosure Act helps garner\nsupport for this mission and that author and creator rights continue to be\nprotected and preserved,\u201d said Willie \u201cProphet\u201d Stiggers, Co-Chair, Black\nMusic Action Coalition.\n\n\u201cCongressman Schiff\u2019s proposal is a big step forward towards responsible AI\nthat partners with artists and creators instead of exploiting them. AI\ncompanies should stop hiding the ball when they copy creative works into AI\nsystems and embrace clear rules of the road for recordkeeping that create a\nlevel and transparent playing field for the development and licensing of\ngenuinely innovative applications and tools,\u201d said Dr. Moiya McTier, Senior\nAdvisor, Human Artistry Campaign.\n\nThe Generative AI Copyright Disclosure Act is supported by the Recording\nIndustry Association of America, Copyright Clearance Center, Directors Guild\nof America, Authors Guild, National Association of Voice Actors, Concept Art\nAssociation, Professional Photographers of America, Screen Actors Guild-\nAmerican Federation of Television and Radio Artists, Writers Guild of America\nWest, Writers Guild of America East, American Society of Composers, Authors\nand Publishers, American Society for Collective Rights Licensing,\nInternational Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, Society of Composers and\nLyricists, National Music Publishers Association, Recording Academy, Nashville\nSongwriters Association International, Songwriters of North America, Black\nMusic Action Coalition, Music Artist Coalition, Human Artistry Campaign, and\nthe American Association of Independent Music.\n\nTo read the full bill text, click HERE.\n\n###\n\n  * Print\n  * Email\n  * Share\n  * Tweet\n\nNext Article Previous Article\n\n  * Contact\n  * Helping You\n  * Issues\n  * News\n  * 30th District\n  * About\n\n  * Facebook Logo\n  * Twitter Logo\n  * Youtube Logo\n  * Instagram Logo\n\n", "frontpage": false}
