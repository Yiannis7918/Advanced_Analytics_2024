I can\u2019t even have a\nrecorded video of me played at German events.\n\nThe trouble started in earnest yesterday, when German police burst into a\nBerlin venue to disband our Palestine congress, which was hosted by the\nDemocracy in Europe Movement 2025 (DiEM25). Judge for yourselves what kind of\nsociety Germany is becoming if its police ban the sentiments below.\n\nCongratulations and heartfelt thanks for being here \u2014 despite the threats,\ndespite the ironclad police outside this venue, despite the panoply of the\nGerman press, despite the German state, despite the German political system\nthat demonizes you for being here.\n\n\u201cWhy a Palestinian congress, Mr Varoufakis?\u201d a German journalist asked me\nrecently. Because, as Hanan Ashrawi once said, \u201cwe cannot rely on the silenced\nto tell us about their suffering.\u201d\n\nToday, Ashrawi\u2019s reason has grown depressingly stronger, because we cannot\nrely on the silenced who are also massacred and starved to tell us about the\nmassacres and the starvation.\n\nBut there is another reason, too: because a proud, decent people, the people\nof Germany, are led down a perilous road to a heartless society by being made\nto associate themselves with another genocide carried out in their name, with\ntheir complicity.\n\nI am neither Jewish nor Palestinian. But I am incredibly proud to be here\namong Jews and Palestinians \u2014 to blend my voice for peace and universal human\nrights with Jewish voices for peace and universal human rights, with\nPalestinian voices for peace and universal human rights. Being together here\ntoday is proof that coexistence is not only possible \u2014 but that it is here\nalready.\n\n\u201cWhy not a Jewish congress, Mr Varoufakis?\u201d the same German journalist asked\nme, imagining that he was being smart. I welcomed his question.\n\nFor if a single Jew is threatened, anywhere, just because she or he is Jewish,\nI shall wear the Star of David on my lapel and offer my solidarity \u2014 whatever\nthe cost, whatever it takes.\n\n\"Universal human rights are either universal or they mean nothing.\"\n\nSo let\u2019s be clear: if Jews were under attack, anywhere in the world, I would\nbe the first to canvass for a Jewish congress in which to register our\nsolidarity.\n\nSimilarly, when Palestinians are massacred because they are Palestinians \u2014\nunder a dogma that to be dead and Palestinian, they must have been Hamas \u2014 I\nshall wear my keffiyeh and offer my solidarity whatever the cost, whatever it\ntakes.\n\nUniversal human rights are either universal or they mean nothing.\n\nWith this in mind, I answered the German journalist\u2019s question with a few of\nmy own:\n\n  * Are two million Israeli Jews, who were thrown out of their homes and into an open-air prison eighty years ago, still being kept in that open-air prison, without access to the outside world, with minimal food and water, with no chance of a normal life or of traveling anywhere, while being bombed periodically for these eighty years? No.\n  * Are Israeli Jews being starved intentionally by an army of occupation, their children writhing on the floor, screaming from hunger? No.\n  * Are there thousands of Jewish injured children with no surviving parents crawling through the rubble of what used to be their homes? No.\n  * Are Israeli Jews being bombed by the world\u2019s most sophisticated planes and bombs? No.\n  * Are Israeli Jews experiencing complete ecocide of what little land they can still call their own, with not one tree left under which they can seek shade or whose fruit they can taste? No.\n  * Are Israeli Jewish children killed by snipers today at the orders of a member state of the United Nations (UN)? No.\n  * Are Israeli Jews driven out of their homes by armed gangs today? No.\n  * Is Israel fighting for its existence today? No.\n\nIf the answer to any of these questions were yes, I would be participating in\na Jewish solidarity congress today.\n\nToday, we would have loved to have a decent, democratic, mutually respectful\ndebate on how to bring peace and universal human rights to everyone \u2014 Jews and\nPalestinians, Bedouins and Christians \u2014 from the Jordan River to the\nMediterranean Sea with people who think differently from us.\n\nSadly, the whole of the German political system has decided not to allow this.\nIn a joint statement including not just the CDU-CSU (Christian Democratic\nUnion\u2013Christian Social Union in Bavaria) and the FDP (Free Democratic Party)\nbut also the SPD (Social Democratic Party), the Greens, and, remarkably, two\nleaders of Die Linke (The Left), Germany\u2019s political spectrum joined forces to\nensure that such a civilized debate, in which we may disagree agreeably, never\ntakes place in Germany.\n\nI say to them: you want to silence us, to ban us, to demonize us, to accuse\nus. You therefore leave us with no choice but to meet your ridiculous\naccusations with our own rational accusations. You chose this, not us.\n\nYou accuse us of antisemitic hatred. We accuse you of being the antisemite\u2019s\nbest friend by equating the right of Israel to commit war crimes with the\nright of Israeli Jews to defend themselves.\n\nYou accuse us of supporting terrorism. We accuse you of equating legitimate\nresistance to an apartheid state with atrocities against civilians which I\nhave always and will always condemn, whoever commits them \u2014 Palestinians,\nJewish settlers, my own family, whoever. We accuse you of not recognizing the\nduty of the people of Gaza to tear down the wall of the open prison they have\nbeen encased in for eighty years \u2014 and of equating this act of tearing down\nthe wall of shame, which is no more defensible than the Berlin Wall was, with\nacts of terror.\n\nYou accuse us of trivializing Hamas\u2019s October 7 terror. We accuse you of\ntrivializing the eighty years of Israel\u2019s ethnic cleansing of Palestinians and\nthe erection of an ironclad apartheid system across Israel-Palestine. We\naccuse you of trivializing Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s long-term support of Hamas as\na means of destroying the two-state solution that you claim to favor. We\naccuse you of trivializing the unprecedented terror unleashed by the Israeli\narmy on the people of Gaza, the West Bank. and East Jerusalem.\n\nYou accuse the organizers of today\u2019s congress of being, and I quote, \u201cnot\ninterested in talking about possibilities for peaceful coexistence in the\nMiddle East against the background of the war in Gaza.\u201d Are you serious? Have\nyou lost your mind?\n\nWe accuse you of supporting a German state that is, after the United States,\nthe largest supplier of the weapons that the Netanyahu government uses to\nmassacre Palestinians as part of a grand plan to make a two-state solution,\nand peaceful coexistence between Jews and Palestinians, impossible. We accuse\nyou of never answering the pertinent question that every German must answer:\nHow much Palestinian blood must flow before your justified guilt over the\nHolocaust is washed away?\n\nSo let\u2019s be clear: we are here in Berlin with our Palestinian congress\nbecause, unlike the German political system and the German media, we condemn\ngenocide and war crimes regardless of who is perpetrating them. Because we\noppose apartheid in the land of Israel-Palestine no matter who has the upper\nhand \u2014 just as we opposed apartheid in the American South or in South Africa.\nBecause we stand for universal human rights, freedom, and equality among Jews,\nPalestinians, Bedouins, and Christians in the ancient land of Palestine.\n\n\"Unlike the German political system and the German media, we condemn genocide\nand war crimes regardless of who is perpetrating them.\"\n\nAnd so that we are even clearer on the questions, legitimate and malignant,\nthat we must always be ready to answer:\n\nDo I condemn Hamas\u2019 atrocities?\n\nI condemn every single atrocity, whoever is the perpetrator or the victim.\nWhat I do not condemn is armed resistance to an apartheid system designed as\npart of a slow-burning but inexorable ethnic-cleansing program. Put\ndifferently, I condemn every attack on civilians while, at the same time, I\ncelebrate anyone who risks their life to tear down the wall.\n\nIs Israel not engaged in a war for its very existence?\n\nNo, it is not. Israel is a nuclear-armed state with perhaps the most\ntechnologically advanced army in the world and the panoply of the US military\nmachine at its back. There is no symmetry with Hamas, a group that can cause\nserious damage to Israelis but has no capacity whatsoever to defeat Israel\u2019s\nmilitary, or even to prevent Israel from continuing to implement the slow\ngenocide of Palestinians under the system of Apartheid that has been erected\nwith long-standing US and European Union support.\n\nAre Israelis not justified to fear that Hamas wants to exterminate them?\n\nOf course they are! Jews have suffered a Holocaust that was preceded by\npogroms and a deep-seated antisemitism permeating Europe and the Americas for\ncenturies. It is only natural that Israelis live in fear of a new pogrom if\nthe Israeli army folds. However, by imposing apartheid on their neighbors and\nby treating them like subhumans, the Israeli state is stoking the fires of\nantisemitism and strengthening Palestinians and Israelis who just want to\nannihilate each other. In the end, its actions contribute to the awful\ninsecurity consuming Jews in Israel and the diaspora. Apartheid against the\nPalestinians is the Israelis\u2019 worst self-defense.\n\nWhat about antisemitism?\n\nIt is always a clear and present danger. And it must be eradicated, especially\namongst the ranks of the global left and the Palestinians fighting for\nPalestinian civil liberties around the world.\n\nWhy don\u2019t Palestinians pursue their objectives by peaceful means?\n\nThey did. The PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) recognized Israel and\nrenounced armed struggle. And what did they get for it? Absolute humiliation\nand systematic ethnic cleansing. That is what nurtured Hamas and elevated it\nthe eyes of many Palestinians as the only alternative to a slow genocide under\nIsrael\u2019s apartheid.\n\nWhat should be done now? What might bring Peace to Israel-Palestine?\n\n  * An immediate cease-fire.\n  * The release of all hostages \u2014 Hamas\u2019s and the thousands held by Israel.\n  * A peace process, under the UN, supported by a commitment from the international community to end apartheid and to safeguard equal civil liberties for all.\n  * As for what must replace apartheid, it is up to Israelis and Palestinians to decide between the two-state solution and the solution of a single federal secular state.\n\nFriends, we are here because vengeance is a lazy form of grief.\n\nWe are here to promote not vengeance but peace and coexistence across Israel-\nPalestine.\n\nWe are here to tell German democrats, including our former comrades of Die\nLinke, that they have covered themselves in shame long enough \u2014 that two\nwrongs do not one right make \u2014 and that allowing Israel to get away with war\ncrimes is not going to ameliorate the legacy of Germany\u2019s crimes against the\nJewish people.\n\nBeyond today\u2019s congress, we have a duty in Germany to change the conversation.\nWe have a duty to persuade the vast majority of decent Germans out there that\nuniversal human rights are what matters. That never again means never again\nfor anyone. Jewish, Palestinian, Ukrainian, Russian, Yemeni, Sudanese, Rwandan\n\u2014 for everyone, everywhere.\n\nIn this context, I am pleased to announce that DiEM25\u2019s German political party\nMERA25 will be on the ballot paper in the European Parliament election this\ncoming June \u2014 seeking the vote of German humanists who crave a member of\nEuropean Parliament representing Germany and calling out the EU\u2019s complicity\nin genocide, a complicity that is Europe\u2019s greatest gift to the antisemites in\nEurope and beyond.\n\nI salute you all and suggest we never forget that none of us is free if one of\nus is in chains.\n\n#### Share this article\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\n#### Contributors\n\nYanis Varoufakis was Greek finance minister during the first months of the\nSyriza-led government in 2015.
