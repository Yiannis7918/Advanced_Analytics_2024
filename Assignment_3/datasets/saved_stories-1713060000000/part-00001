(Yen-Chen Tsui, Princeton University)\n\nElectrons are marvelous little things. They often hang about orbiting atomic\nnuclei, but they don't have to \u2013 the Universe is full of loose electrons\nrattling about.\n\nNinety years ago, theoretical physicist Eugene Wigner proposed that they\ndidn't have to rattle about, either: that free electrons may be forced\ntogether in a peculiar kind of matter that has no atoms at all, just electrons\ntrapped by their own repulsion a neat, crystalline lattice.\n\nThis is known as a Wigner crystal, and physicists have finally obtained direct\nobservational evidence that it can exist.\n\n\"The Wigner crystal is one of the most fascinating quantum phases of matter\nthat has been predicted and the subject of numerous studies claiming to have\nfound at best indirect evidence for its formation,\" says physicist Al Yazdani\nof Princeton University.\n\n\"Visualizing this crystal allows us not only to watch its formation,\nconfirming many of its properties, but we can also study it in ways you\ncouldn't in the past.\"\n\nA crystal refers to the way atoms can be arranged in solid matter. In typical\ncrystalline materials, the atoms are bound to one another in a way that forms\na repeating pattern in space.\n\nWigner's groundbreaking 1934 paper proposed that electrons could form similar\narrangements, aided \u2013 not hindered \u2013 by the mutual revulsion generated by the\nnegative charge carried by all electrons.\n\nAt extremely low temperatures and at low densities, the repulsive interaction\nbetween electrons should, he theorized, see their potential energy dominate\ntheir need to zoom about, causing them to fall into crystal-like lattice\narrangements.\n\nThese crystals would not behave according to classical physics, but quantum\nmechanics, with the bound electrons behaving not like discrete particles but\nan individual wave. A variety of experiments involving two-dimensional systems\ndesigned to detect the outcomes of this behavior have ponied up indirect\nevidence of Wigner crystals, but direct evidence has been a bit trickier to\ncome by.\n\n\"There are literally hundreds of scientific papers that study these effects\nand claim that the results must be due to the Wigner crystal,\" Yazdani says,\n\"but one can't be sure, because none of these experiments actually see the\ncrystal.\"\n\nWith the flaws of these experiments in mind, a team led by physicists Yen-Chen\nTsui, Minhao He, and Yuwen Hu of Princeton University designed an experiment\nthat they hoped would resolve previous problems and reveal the crystal.\n\nThey used magnetic fields to induce an electron Wigner crystal in graphene,\nbut not just any old graphene. The material had to be as pristine as possible,\nto eliminate any effects that might be generated by atomic imperfections.\n\nTwo sheets of graphene were prepared and arranged in a specific configuration\nbefore being cooled to just a fraction above absolute zero. A magnetic field\nwas then applied to tune the density of the electron gas sandwiched between\nthe layers.\n\nThe Wigner crystal revealed using STM. (Yen-Chen Tsui, Princeton University)\n\nThe Wigner crystal has an electron density sweet spot. If the density is too\nlow, the electrons will push each other away and they'll just sort of zoom\noff. If the density is too high, the electrons will mush together into an\nelectron liquid.\n\nAt the Goldilocks spot, the electrons will try to repel each other... but\ntheir escape will be cut off by other electrons. So they'll just sort of\narrange themselves into a grid, maintaining as much equidistance between them\nas possible.\n\nTo measure this crystal phase, the researchers used high-resolution scanning\ntunneling microscopy (STM) to measure it. STM uses quantum tunneling to probe\nmaterials on an atomic scale, where optical microscopy can't quite reach.\n\n\"In our experiment, we can image the system as we tune the number of the\nelectrons per unit area. Just by changing the density, you can initiate this\nphase transition and find electrons spontaneously form into an ordered\ncrystal,\" Tsui explains.\n\n\"Our work provides the first direct images of this crystal. We proved the\ncrystal is really there and we can see it.\"\n\nTheir measurements also confirmed models describing the lattice as triangular\nwhen confined to a 2D space, though found it can remain stable as the density\nis tuned to quite a large degree \u2013 contradicting previous theories that the\ndensity range must be quite small. They also found that the electrons don't\noccupy a single point in the lattice, but a blurry range of positions\ndescribed as zero-point motion.\n\n\"Electrons, even when frozen into a Wigner crystal, should exhibit strong\nzero-point motion,\" says Yazdani. \"It turns out this quantum motion covers a\nthird of the distance between them, making the Wigner crystal a novel quantum\ncrystal.\"\n\nThe findings have been published in Nature.\n\nTrending News\n\nFasting-Style Diet Seems to Result in Dynamic Changes to Human Brain Health3\ndays ago\n\nThe Polar Vortex Has Shifted Into Reverse \u2013 And Is Now Spinning Backwards\nEnvironment6 days ago\n\nScientists Accidentally Made a Mouse Grow Legs in Place of Genitals Health4\ndays ago\n\n", "frontpage": false}
