Initially h5ai was an\nacronym for HTML5 Apache Index but now it supports other web servers too.\n\nSee the demo directory with most features enabled. A reduced example and my\nactual use case is the release directory for the projects on this page.\n\nRequires PHP 7.0+ and works fine with Apache httpd, lighttpd and nginx. Best\nuser experience with the latest versions of Chromium-based browsers, Firefox,\nSafari and Edge, but a static fallback is provided for older browsers or if\nJavaScript is disabled.\n\n## Features\n\nThere are lots of optional extensions and configuration options to customize\nthe web appearance of your directory listings. All markup is valid HTML5\nspiced up with CSS3 and finest JavaScript to build a fresh but minimal user\ninterface and a user experience that focuses on your files.\n\nSome of the optional features are: file sorting, different view modes,\nlocalization, a breadcrumb, a tree view, custom headers and footers, file\nfilter and search, folder sizes, auto refresh, packaged download, QR codes,\nthumbnails, file previews\n\n## Installation\n\n  1. Copy folder _h5ai to the document root directory of the web server: DOC_ROOT/_h5ai.\n    \n        DOC_ROOT \u251c\u2500 _h5ai \u251c\u2500 your files \u2514\u2500 and folders\n\n  2. Visit http://YOUR-DOMAIN.TLD/_h5ai/public/index.php, to check if h5ai is reachable. This page shows some hints on the server's capabilities.\n  3. Add /_h5ai/public/index.php (note the leading slash!) to the end of the default index-file list. In this way h5ai will manage all directories in and below DOC_ROOT that don't have a index file.\n\nApache httpd 2.2/2.4: in httpd.conf or in the root directory's .htaccess file\nset for example:\n\n    \n        DirectoryIndex index.html index.php /_h5ai/public/index.php\n\nlighttpd 1.4: in lighttpd.conf set for example:\n\n    \n        index-file.names += (\"index.html\", \"index.php\", \"/_h5ai/public/index.php\")\n\nnginx 1.2: in nginx.conf set for example:\n\n    \n        index index.html index.php /_h5ai/public/index.php;\n\nCherokee 1.2: in cherokee.conf set for example:\n\n    \n        vserver!1!directory_index = index.html,index.php,/_h5ai/public/index.php\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe main configuration file is _h5ai/private/conf/options.json. You might want\nto change some of the documented settings. But there are some more files in\n_h5ai/private/conf you might have a look at.\n\n## Hints\n\n  * No web server specific things are supported, that includes access restrictions! Best chance to make restricted areas work and secure might be to place folder _h5ai completely inside that resticted area. Use it at your own risk!\n\n  * Does not work with aliased folders in general (as available in Apache httpd). Aliased folders make it impossible to map URLs to file system folders.\n\n  * If no icons are displayed, chances are that you have to add the SVG MIME-type to your server.\n\n  * On Ubuntu servers you might need to install an additional package for PHP JSON support.\n\n  * To use optional features based on shell commands the PHP functions exec and passthru must not be disabled in php.ini (have a look for disable_functions).\n\n  * There was a security flaw in versions v0.22.0-v0.24.1 that was fixed in v0.25.0 (summer 2014). If you are still using one of these versions you are advised to upgrade.\n\n## Custom installation\n\nIt's possible to install h5ai into any sub directory of your web server's\ndocument root. This directory will then be considered the root directory when\nshowing a breadcrumb etc.\n\nFor example copy folder _h5ai to DOC_ROOT/some/folder/_h5ai:\n\n    \n    \n    DOC_ROOT \u2514\u2500 some \u2514\u2500 folder \u251c\u2500 _h5ai \u251c\u2500 your files \u2514\u2500 and folders\n\nVisit http://YOUR-DOMAIN.TLD/some/folder/_h5ai/public/index.php to see if\neverything works fine. In this example you need to add\n/some/folder/_h5ai/public/index.php to your index-file list (as in step 3\nabove).\n\n", "frontpage": false}
