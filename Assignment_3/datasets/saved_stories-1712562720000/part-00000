Ben Ray Lujan about their fight to get\ncompensation for New Mexico radiation victims.\n\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\n\nThe first time Americans had ever heard of the atomic bomb was hours after the\nU.S. bombed Hiroshima in August 1945. But it was tested a month before that in\nthe Jornada del Muerto desert of New Mexico. It was a top-secret mission. None\nof the locals knew what was coming - like a group of adolescent girls at a\nsummer dance camp about 40 miles away.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)\n\nLESLEY BLUME: It was 10 young girls, around 13, 14 years old. They were jarred\nfrom their beds when the blast went off at 5:29 that morning.\n\nSHAPIRO: Journalist Lesley Blume wrote about the survivors of the Trinity test\nand spoke to NPR in 2021. She said the young girls thought the ash falling\nfrom the sky was snow.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)\n\nBLUME: The apparent sole survivor of that episode described to me that they\nwere so excited that they got into bathing suits and played in a nearby river\nand were pressing the snow into their faces, into their skin, and that it\nabsorbed really quickly.\n\nSHAPIRO: Only one of those girls lived to tell the story. Others died from\nvarious illnesses. And at least hundreds of New Mexicans were sickened by the\nradiation. Tina Cordova is a downwinder of the Trinity test and a cancer\nsurvivor. She's been fighting alongside New Mexico Senator Democrat Ben Ray\nLujan to reauthorize and expand the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, or\nRECA. Earlier today, the Senate passed that legislation, and it's now up for a\nvote in the House. Tina Cordova and Senator Ben Ray Lujan, thank you for being\nhere.\n\nBEN RAY LUJAN: Ari, good to be with you. Thank you so much for telling this\nstory.\n\nTINA CORDOVA: We appreciate this opportunity, Ari.\n\nSHAPIRO: Tina, I'd love to start with you. Can you tell us about where you\ngrew up and how much of your community has suffered health problems, likely\nbecause of the radiation they were exposed to?\n\nCORDOVA: Yeah, absolutely. I grew up in a community about 45 miles, the way\nthe crows fly, from the Trinity bomb site. And my dad was a 4-year-old child\nat the time of the test, and today is the 11th anniversary of when he passed\naway from cancer. He actually had three different cancers before he died. And\nit's not just my family. I mean, we've documented hundreds and hundreds of\nfamilies like mine that are displaying four and five generations of cancer.\nI'm a cancer survivor. And so, you know, this is something that's had a\ntremendous negative effect on us, and everybody has always looked away.\n\nSHAPIRO: When you were first diagnosed with thyroid cancer at the age of 39,\ndid you know that it was probably because of radiation exposure?\n\nCORDOVA: Well, I have a background in the sciences, so I had a very strong\nfeeling that it was. And one of the first questions the doctors asked me at\nthe time of the diagnosis was, when were you exposed to radiation? And so yes,\nI always knew that it was as a result of the exposure to radiation I had\nexperienced as a child growing up.\n\nSHAPIRO: Senator Lujan, RECA has been in place since 1990. Why did it\ninitially fail to include the Trinity downwinders - the very first people in\nthe world who were exposed to radiation from nuclear testing?\n\nLUJAN: Ari, you're asking the right question here, and I'm sad to say that\nnobody can answer that question. How can the community where the first nuclear\nbomb was tested on soil anywhere in the world - how was that community left\nout of downwind inclusion? And no one can answer that. I mean, it's one of the\nreasons why we are all fighting diligently for all the families throughout New\nMexico and throughout America that deserve to be seen and heard and included\nin this compensation - families like Tina's.\n\nSHAPIRO: What do you hope this expanded program, if it is signed into law,\nwill do for people like Tina?\n\nLUJAN: It's going to, first, ensure that our friends and family, like Tina\nCordova, are seen, are heard. This is going to provide a level of support and\ncompensation to help them with their health struggles. They were never, ever\ngiven a heads-up that there was going to be a test of a nuclear site - an\nexplosion, a bright light. This will provide a level of support to help each\nand every one of these families to be made as whole as possible. But Ari, I\ndon't know that there's anything to ever make them completely whole, but I'm\ndoing everything that I can to ensure that the federal government accepts full\nliability and responsibility and that we can move together as Democrats and\nRepublicans working with the president, who has issued a statement of support\nto get this done, to recognize these families and all the sacrifices of them\nand the uranium mine workers who were - also were left out of the original\nlegislation.\n\nSHAPIRO: Tina, there is so much that can never be restored. You mentioned that\nyour father died 11 years ago. But what do you think this legislation can do?\nWhat tangible things do you hope to get from this bill if it passes?\n\nCORDOVA: What I will tell you is that, when this bill finally passes, there\nwill be people in New Mexico and across the American West and Guam - uranium\nworkers, as Senator Lujan has mentioned, and downwinders - who will for the\nfirst time ever be acknowledged. And Ari, honestly, I have lost count of all\nthe people who started out on this journey with me who are gone now and will\nnever see that day. And so for me, that acknowledgement is incredibly\nimportant, and the payment of restitution will assist people who are waiting\ntoday for cancer treatment and don't have the means for that.\n\nSHAPIRO: Your organization, the Tularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium, has\nbeen doing health surveys to document the health histories of people in your\ncommunity. It's really hard to know how many people in New Mexico and beyond\nwere impacted by the Trinity test. What have you learned from the surveys that\nyour organization has done?\n\nCORDOVA: Well, the primary thing we've learned is that hundreds of families\nhave been affected. It's multigenerational in nature. I mentioned earlier that\nI'm a cancer survivor, so I'm the fourth generation in my family, and there's\na fifth generation now. I have a 24-year-old niece who was diagnosed with\nthyroid cancer at the age of 23.\n\nSHAPIRO: Oh, my goodness.\n\nCORDOVA: And so - yeah - this is not something that's going away anytime soon,\nAri. And those health surveys have helped us to better understand how it's not\nonly affected us physically, but it's affected us emotionally, psychologically\nand financially. People end up losing everything that they have when they\ndon't have access to health care and they're trying to save their lives or the\nlives of their family members.\n\nSHAPIRO: I know this is a complicated question, but can you tell us why people\nstay in this part of New Mexico, even knowing what comes with it - the\ngenerations of cancer, of toxins?\n\nCORDOVA: First of all, let me start out by saying this - that footprints were\nfound at White Sands National Monument, which is literally adjacent to the\nTrinity test site. Those footprints are 23,000 years old. So we've lived in\nthis area for 23,000 years. You know, we are people that are very place-based\nand grounded in where we're from, so it's really difficult to uproot yourself.\nWe had an option to be warned and relocated in advance, but that didn't\nhappen, so now it's too late for us. We have been exposed, and we have the\ngenetics for this. It doesn't make any sense to leave now.\n\nSHAPIRO: Senator Lujan, you've chosen Tina to be your guest tonight for the\nState of the Union address. What do you hope her presence and story will get\nacross to legislators?\n\nLUJAN: Tina Cordova has already educated the American people about her life,\nabout the life of her family and so many others and other members' offices\nfrom the U.S. House of Representatives and senators that now know Tina Cordova\nby name. Tina Cordova alone is responsible for more colleagues in the House\nand in the United States Senate now voting in favor of fixing this injustice\nand addressing it.\n\nSHAPIRO: Senator Ben Ray Lujan, Democrat of New Mexico, and Tina Cordova,\ncancer survivor and advocate for the expansion of the Radiation Exposure\nCompensation Act. Thank you both so much.\n\nLUJAN: Thank you, Ari.\n\nCORDOVA: Thank you, Ari.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 NPR. All rights reserved.
