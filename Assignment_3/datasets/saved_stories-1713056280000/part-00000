This test has\nbeen standardized in ISO 3888-2.^[1]\n\nForms of the test have been performed in Sweden since the 1970s.^[2] The\ncolloquial and internationally better-known name for the test was coined in\n1997 by the German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung after the Swedish motor\nmagazine Teknikens V\u00e4rld together with the TV-show Trafikmagasinet flipped a\nMercedes-Benz A-Class in a test ostensibly made to measure the car's ability\nto avoid hitting a moose.\n\nIn reality, the test is constructed to simulate, for example, a reversing car\nor a child rushing out onto the road.^[3]^[4] This is because it is more\nlikely that the moose will continue across the road than remain in place or\nturn back, making it more advisable to brake hard and try to slip behind the\nanimal than to swerve in front of it.^[5]\n\n## Test specifications[edit]\n\nThe test is performed on a dry road surface. Traffic cones are set up in an S\nshape to simulate the obstacle, road, and road edges. The car to be tested has\none belted person in each available seat and weights in the boot to achieve\nmaximum load. In order to qualify as a \"pass\" the vehicle must successfully\nnavigate the course at 72 km/h (45 mph).^[6]\n\nWhen the driver comes onto the track, they quickly swerve into the oncoming\nlane to avoid the object and then immediately swerve back to avoid oncoming\ntraffic. The test is repeated at an increased speeds until the car skids,\nknocks down cones, or spins around.\n\n## 1997 Mercedes A-Class test[edit]\n\nOn 21 October 1997 the journalist Robert Collin from the motor magazine\nTeknikens V\u00e4rld overturned the new Mercedes-Benz A-Class in the moose test at\n60 km/h (37 mph), while a Trabant\u2014a much older, and widely mocked car from the\nformer East Germany\u2014managed it perfectly.^[7]\n\nDuring an interview in S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, Collin tried to explain this test\nby the example of an evasive manoeuvre for a moose on the road. It was soon\ncalled Elchtest (moose test).^[8]\n\nMercedes initially denied the problem, but then took the step of recalling all\nunits sold to date (2,600), rebuilding 17,000 cars^[9] and suspending sales\nfor three months until the problem was solved by adding electronic stability\ncontrol and modifying the suspension.^[10] The company spent DM 2.5 billion in\ndeveloping the car, with a further DM 300 million to fix it.^[11]\n\n## Ongoing testing[edit]\n\nSwedish automotive magazine Teknikens V\u00e4rld tests \"hundreds of cars every\nyear\".^[2] with the moose test. It publishes test results since 1983 on their\nwebsite.^[12] The car with the slowest speed to successfully complete the\nmanoeuvre is the Reliant Rialto at 42.5 km/h (26.4 mph).\n\nIn July 2005, the Dacia Logan appeared initially to fail the test, but a later\ninvestigation concluded that excessive testing had worn the car's tyres to\nfailure.\n\nSome current vehicles, such as the 2021\u2013present Mitsubishi Outlander and Volvo\nXC40 Recharge T4, still fail this test, although after the latest software\nrevision the RAV4 now passes the test.^[6]^[13]\n\n## Current champion[edit]\n\nThe Citro\u00ebn Xantia Activa V6 has held the record since 1999,^[14] beating cars\nsuch as the track-orientated 2008 Porsche 911 GT3 RS^[15]^[16] and the 2017\nMcLaren 675LT.^[17]^[18]^[19] The Citro\u00ebn performed the test at 85 km/h (53\nmph).\n\n## Actual moose collision testing[edit]\n\nAlthough the moose test itself is based on the avoidance of hitting an\nobstruction in the road, testing is also carried out on actual collision with\nanimals in the road. Both Volvo and Saab have a tradition of taking moose\ncrashes into account when building cars.^[20]\n\nThe Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute has developed a\nmoose crash test dummy called \"Mooses\". The dummy (which is made with similar\nweight, centre of gravity and dimensions to a live moose) is used to simulate\nrealistic moose collisions.\n\nAustralian car manufacturers use crash test kangaroo dummies for similar\nreasons.^[21]\n\nIn a 2008 episode of Mythbusters, the urban legend that accelerating to hit a\nmoose would cause less damage than braking was investigated and busted. It was\nfound that regardless of car type and speed, the damage to a vehicle was\ncatastrophic in all cases.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Tilt test (vehicle safety test)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"VEHICO Fahrroboter - Index\".\n  2. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b Rabe, Mattias (10 July 2012). \"How Jeep Grand Cherokee failed the evasive manoeuvre test\".
