Tehran holds Israel responsible for the attack earlier this month,\nwhich the US military believes Israel carried out. Israel has not commented on\nit.\n\nThe increased tensions have sparked international concern that Israel\u2019s\ndevastating war against Hamas in Gaza could spill over into the rest of the\nMiddle East.\n\nIsrael has called up additional air defense units and activated other troops\nin anticipation of an attack by either Iran or the many proxy militant groups\nit supports in the region.\n\nThe army\u2019s chief spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, told reporters Thursday\nthat an attack from Iranian territory \u201cwould be clear proof of Iranian\nintentions to escalate the Middle East and stop hiding behind the proxies.\u201d\n\nDON'T MISS: Israel's Iron Dome 'overwhelmed' by Hezbollah rockets as Iran\nunleashes hell [SPOTLIGHT] Iran's Israel strike options mapped as Netanyahu\nsinks deeper into 'quagmire' [EXCLUSIVE] Iran and Hezbollah to strike 'every\ninch of Israel' with missiles [REPORT]\n\nFuneral of IRGC members killed in Syria (Image: Getty)\n\n### Trending\n\nHagari said Israel has improved its offensive and defensive capabilities in\nrecent months. \u201cWe will know how to act where needed,\u201d he said.\n\nHagari added that the head of the US military\u2019s Central Command, Gen.
