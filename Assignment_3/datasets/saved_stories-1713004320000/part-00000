This emergent phenomenon of human\ncollaboration, enabled by the internet, makes it possible for organizations of\nevery size\u2014including for-profit businesses\u2014to get more done, faster, with less\nfriction and with more predictability. It's the foundation of our digital\neconomy.\n\nProprietary software is fine. It is what it is. Sure, it lacks the\ncollaborative advantages of open source software, but at least it does what it\nsays on the tin. Pay me this, I'll give you that, and you can use it according\nto this specific license we negotiate.\n\nProprietary software masquerading as open source\u2014what has been termed fauxpen\nsource\u2014is toxic. It's an intentionally deceptive hybrid that seeks to give its\nproponents the best of both worlds\u2014the positive vibe and broad distribution of\nopen source, together with the commercial leverage of proprietary software.\n\nFauxpen source isn't entirely new\u2014witness the discredited Sun Community Source\nLicense of the early '00s\u2014but in recent months this dysfunctional concept has\nresurfaced with a vengeance.\n\nFauxpen source is a disrespectful appropriation of free software and open\nsource culture.\n\nBut fauxpen source is also just plain bad for business. Here's why.\n\n## Fauxpen source is bad for business because it is confusing by design\n\nAlmost every business relies on open source components in their applications.\nIn fact, recent surveys indicate that 92% of applications include open source.\n\nWhat does it mean to be \"open source\"? It doesn't just mean that the source\ncode is available\u2014it means a lot more. To keep everyone on the same page, the\nnonprofit Open Source Initiative was formed in 1998 to define and govern the\nuse of the term \"open source.\"\n\nWhen businesses select open source components for their applications, they\nknow they can rely on the elements of the Open Source Definition, including:\n\n  * Free redistribution, without royalties or fees, including derived works\n  * Source code availability, so it can be adapted and modified\n  * No discrimination against persons, groups, or fields of endeavor so it can be used for any purpose, including any business\n\nMost fauxpen source licenses plainly don't comply with the requirements of the\nopen source definition. The source code may be available, but they are not\nopen source.\n\nSure, there are some important additional considerations that businesses\nconsuming true open source software must take into account\u2014copyleft vs.\npermissive licenses, attribution requirements, etc. But as a starting point,\nbusinesses can rest assured they enjoy the broad protections afforded by the\nOpen Source Definition.\n\nFauxpen source licenses upend the clarity of the open source definition by\nintroducing new complexity and confusion into the mix. That confusion and\nuncertainty significantly complicates things for businesses that critically\nrely on open source.\n\nIntroducing confusion into your software supply chain slows things down and\nadds risk to your company. And that's just bad for business.\n\n## Fauxpen source is bad for business because its costs and availability are\nunknowable\n\nThe terms of non-open source licenses can change at any time. And they\ndo\u2014witness recent events with software released by Redis Labs, Confluent, and\nothers.\n\nEven if those license changes don't apply to prior releases of the software,\nthey do apply going forward. Is it viable for your business to stay on an old\nversion of your database perpetually or carry the burden of maintaining a fork\nof that old software yourself forever? Certainly not, and fauxpen source\nproponents know that\u2014which is why this gambit works. Even if you can keep\nusing their software by buying a proprietary commercial license, the terms and\ncost can change at the time and place of their choosing.\n\nThe problem isn't that fauxpen source is expensive. It's that its future\ncosts, and even its future availability, are unknowable. You're one bad vendor\nacquisition away from being stuck up a creek without a paddle\u2014or stuck in a\ndark alley with a knife at your throat.\n\nDidn't the industry's shift away from proprietary software and towards open\nsource just get us out of this Stockholm syndrome where software vendors hold\nall the cards and demand fealty from their customers? What software-dependent\nbusiness would be eager to return to that dysfunctional dynamic?\n\nFauxpen source leaves your business susceptible to a bait-and-switch followed\nby a hold-up. That's a poor business strategy.\n\n## Fauxpen source is bad for business because it unfairly depletes our shared\nsoftware commons\n\nProponents of fauxpen source frequently offer the defense that they are\nprotecting themselves from free riders who would use their software without\nsubsidizing its creation and maintenance.\n\nMeanwhile, those same fauxpen source vendors freely appropriate millions of\nlines of code from other open source projects to power their own businesses\nwithout contributing back anything at all to most of those projects.\n\n> I'd have more sympathy for the \"Big companies don't pay us when they use our\n> free software, so we have to use a non-free license\" arguments if there was\n> any evidence that the people making this argument were funding all the free\n> software they depend on\n>\n> \u2014 Matthew Garrett (@mjg59) February 19, 2019\n\n> BRB re-licensing my software under licenses that are free for everyone\n> except people who add bullshit non-free clauses because they don't\n> understand the philosophy that allowed their company to exist in the first\n> place\n>\n> \u2014 Matthew Garrett (@mjg59) February 19, 2019\n\nIn reality, fauxpen source vendors themselves are free-riding on the efforts\nof the open source community, but in an even more pernicious way. Instead of\nadding to the commons they rely on, they are appropriating the open source\nbrand while withholding their own software from that commons. That's an unfair\ntrade.\n\nStrip-mining the open source community in this way, without contributing to\nthe underlying commons, while leveraging the benefits that the open source\nbrand enables, means fewer quality open source components for\neveryone\u2014including businesses\u2014to build on. And that's just plain bad for\nbusiness.\n\n## Let's reject fauxpen source and choose a better path\n\nFauxpen source is a cynical ploy that risks damaging the wonderful opportunity\nfor innovation that we've collectively created with open source software.\n\nBut as technologists and professionals, we don't have to put up with it.\n\nLet's reject fauxpen source in the marketplace and instead choose better\nbusiness models that are aligned with the values and traditions that have made\nopen source the world-changing phenomenon it is today.\n\nWhen software vendors choose to follow a fauxpen source approach, we should\nvote with our voices, our feet, and our dollars to push them back onto a more\nsustainable and responsible path.\n\nIf we do that, we can rest assured that we can continue to bet our businesses\non the amazing phenomenon of open source\u2014not fauxpen source\u2014for years to come.\n\nWhat to read next\n\nTags\n\nLicensing\n\nDonald Fischer\n\nDonald Fischer is co-founder and CEO of Tidelift, which makes open source work\nbetter\u2014for everyone.

Patches tat put functionality\nback are rejected...\n\nBai Hui | April 24, 2019\n\nOpen source must be forbidden by law. It s broken business ecosystems, stop\nreturn of investment, create unfair competitiveness and lie stupid users that\neverything is same time qualitative and free. Also programmers that do free\nsoftware mostly are highly paid by companies that some time lost money from\nopen source. Why programmers don't create only open source? How they will pay\ntheir mortgages, loans, food, beer if they only work for \"community\" for free?\n\nadmered1 | May 14, 2019\n\nIf that's your view, why are you even on this site ??!\n\nIn reply to Open source must be forbidden by Bai Hui (not verified)\n\nEthin Probst | May 14, 2019\n\nCan you provide evidence to prove these claims?
