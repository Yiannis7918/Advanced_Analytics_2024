Labour has vowed to close Conservative tax\n\u2018loopholes\u2019.

Instead of using the expected \u00a32.7bn of extra tax\nraised to fund breakfast clubs and hospital appointments, Hunt promised to cut\nnational insurance.\n\nLabour responded by announcing plans go harder and to close \u201cloopholes\u201d in\nHunt\u2019s plan, including one that allowed those who will lose the tax-free\nstatus to still avoid paying inheritance tax on foreign assets held in\noffshore trusts.\n\nShah said: \u201cWe, and our clients, expected Labour to scrap it if they won the\nelection. But no one expected the Conservatives to rush in there and scrap it\nfirst.\u201d\n\nHe said his non-dom clients, many with fortunes stretching into the hundreds\nof millions of pounds, were shocked at the speed with which Hunt was \u201cchanging\nthe rules of game and disrupting their lives when they had come to the UK to\nmake a life here [under the non-dom rules]\u201d. But he said Labour\u2019s plans had\nthe super-rich \u201cpetrified\u201d and \u201cactively looking at where to move to\u201d.\n\nShah and several other advisers contacted by the Guardian said many non-dom\nclients were exploring moving to Italy, which introduced a scheme through\nwhich rich people could pay a \u201cflat tax\u201d of just \u20ac100,000 no matter how much\nmoney they earned.\n\nLimassol, Cyprus.

Photograph: f8grapher/Alamy\n\nFrance, Greece, Cyprus, Malta, Portugal and Spain have similar schemes\ndesigned to attract the wealthy and internationally mobile elite. Spain\u2019s\nexpatriates tax regime is nicknamed the Beckham law after David Beckham, who\nbecame one of the first people to use it when he was playing for Real Madrid.\n\nOther UK-based non-doms are said to be considering moving to traditional tax\nhavens such as Monaco, Switzerland, Dubai and Caribbean islands. However,\nrecent academic research suggests super-rich people may not follow through\nwith threats to move because they fear they would be \u201cbored to death\u201d in the\noften \u201cculturally barren\u201d locations.\n\nUnder non-dom rules, anyone registered as non-domiciled with HMRC does not\nhave to pay UK tax on income and capital gains earned overseas \u2013 including on\ncompany shares or cash made from selling a second home \u2013 unless they bring\ntheir money into Britain or deposit it into a UK bank account. They can retain\nthe status for up to 15 years but there is an annual fee of at least \u00a330,000\nafter seven years.\n\nThere were 68,800 non-doms in the UK in 2021-22, according to the latest\navailable HMRC data.\n\nUnder Hunt\u2019s changes, new arrivals will only be able to avoid tax on overseas\nincome for the first four years of living in the UK. After that, they will be\ntaxed in full on their worldwide income and gains.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got people who only moved to the UK recently, and have built their lives\nand businesses here and have their children in schools here,\u201d said Shah. \u201cBut\nfrom next April they will be exposed to worldwide taxation. It is a cliff\nedge; it\u2019s not surprising that they are looking at leaving.\u201d\n\nMiles Dean, a partner and head of international tax at the tax advisory firm\nAndersen, said his advice to clients was simple: \u201cIf you can leave within six\nmonths, make plans to leave now. The UK is no longer safe as a tax\nenvironment.\u201d\n\nDavid Beckham signing a contract with Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u\nstadium in July 2003.

These people are highly mobile, many\nof them already have a second home somewhere \u2013 why would they stay in the UK?\u201d\n\nResearch by the London School of Economics suggested that scrapping the non-\ndom regime would lead to just 0.3% \u2013 or 77 people \u2013 leaving the UK. Dean\ndescribed this estimate as \u201cludicrous\u201d. \u201cThe comments from me and the other\nadvisers you\u2019ve spoken to aren\u2019t made up, these people will really leave. They\nare angry.\u201d\n\nAndrew Goldstone, a partner at Mishcon de Reya who specialises in advising\nhigh net worth people on offshore tax and trusts, said his clients thought the\nConservative and Labour plans were \u201centirely politically motivated and\neconomically foolish, on the basis that the very wealthiest will leave the UK\nand take with them their spending, investment, jobs and businesses\u201d.\n\nSophie Dworetzsky, a partner advising the super-rich at Charles Russell\nSpeechlys, said her clients thought Labour\u2019s proposals \u201cfeel like trying to\nsqueeze out every last drop until there\u2019s nothing left\u201d. She added: \u201cWe should\nbe concerned about driving away internationally mobile individuals and the\ninvestment that could bring into the country, and the revenue raised from\nwealth creation.\u201d\n\nControversy over the non-dom tax loophole went from being a niche issue among\ntax experts to wider public debate after it was revealed in 2022 that Rishi\nSunak\u2019s wife was using the status to avoid paying millions of pounds in tax on\ndividends she collected from her billionaire father\u2019s IT business.\n\nAfter widespread outrage, Akshata Murty said she would pay UK taxes on all\nfuture income as her tax arrangements were not \u201ccompatible with my husband\u2019s\n[then] job as chancellor\u201d, adding that she appreciated the \u201cBritish sense of\nfairness\u201d.\n\nRishi Sunak and Akshata Murty.

New arrivals will benefit\nfrom 100% relief on foreign income and gains for their first four years as a\nUK tax resident, and there will be transitional arrangements in place for\ncurrent non-doms.\u201d\n\nA Labour spokesperson said they did not believe the policy would lead to an\nexodus of non-doms. \u201cWe do not accept this argument,\u201d they said. \u201cBefore the\nConservatives stole Labour\u2019s non-dom policy, they were making the exact same\nargument only to conveniently drop their warning sound when they adopted the\npolicy.\n\n\u201cLabour\u2019s proposals are about making the tax system fairer. If you make your\nhome and do your business in Britain, then you should pay your taxes here\ntoo.\u201d\n\n  * Are you a non-dom?
