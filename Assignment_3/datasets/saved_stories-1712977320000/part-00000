For the cost of only a few dollars a\npair, reading glasses have a significant and sustained impact on an\nindividual\u2019s earnings and help others get back to work.\u201d\n\nElla Gudwin, a report co-author and chief executive of VisionSpring, said:\n\u201cGlasses to date have been an underdeployed tool ... We hope this evidence\nreveals this simple solution is uniquely powerful and should be deployed\nmore.\u201d\n\n\u2018Many patients are dying blind\u2019: South Africa\u2019s struggle to save eyesight\n\nRead more\n\nSarah Nakalyowa, 57, from Matugga in southern Uganda, is a basket weaver. When\nshe was younger she made two and a half baskets a day and earned\n400,000-500,000 Ugandan shillings (\u00a382-\u00a3103) a month. As her eyesight declined\nfrom around the age of 40, her productivity dropped.\n\n\u201cI use a needle and could not focus well while doing my work. The basket would\ncome out untidy,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen my eyesight got worse, it took four days to\ndo what used to take me a day. My income dropped to 100,000-150,000 Ugandan\nshillings a month.\u201d\n\nSpectacles have made a \u201chuge difference\u201d. \u201cMy work has been made easier.\nBefore, I missed points with the needle. Now it\u2019s OK. I couldn\u2019t read the\nBible, or newspapers. Now I can read very clearly.\u201d\n\nHer income is almost back to its previous level, and she has also started a\nside business growing mushrooms, which she says would not have been possible\nwithout her glasses.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Global development\n  * Bangladesh\n  * South and central Asia\n  * Employment\n  * Global health\n  * Uganda\n  * Health\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * UK\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Ukraine\n  * Environment\n  * Science\n  * Global development\n  * Football\n  * Tech\n  * Business\n  * Obituaries\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
