He was 93.\n\nMacNeil died of natural causes at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, according to\nhis daughter, Alison MacNeil.\n\nMacNeil first gained prominence for his coverage of the Senate Watergate\nhearings for the public broadcasting service and began his half-hour \"Robert\nMacNeil Report\" on PBS in 1975 with his friend Lehrer as Washington\ncorrespondent.\n\nThe broadcast became the \"MacNeil-Lehrer Report\" and then, in 1983, was\nexpanded to an hour and renamed the \"MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour.\" The nation's\nfirst one-hour evening news broadcast, and recipient of several Emmy and\nPeabody awards, it remains on the air today with Geoff Bennett and Amna Nawaz\nas anchors.\n\nIt was MacNeil's and Lehrer's disenchantment with the style and content of\nrival news programs on ABC, CBS and NBC that led to the program's creation.\n\n\"We don't need to SELL the news,\" MacNeil told the Chicago Tribune in 1983.\n\"The networks hype the news to make it seem vital, important. What's missing\n(in 22 minutes) is context, sometimes balance, and a consideration of\nquestions that are raised by certain events.\"\n\nMacNeil left anchoring duties at \"NewsHour\" after two decades in 1995 to write\nfull time. Lehrer took over the newscast alone, and he remained there until\n2009. Lehrer died in 2020.\n\nWhen MacNeil visited the show in October 2005 to commemorate its 30th\nanniversary, he reminisced about how their newscast started in the days before\ncable television.\n\n\"It was a way to do something that seemed to be needed journalistically and\nyet was different from what the commercial network news (programs) were\ndoing,\" he said.\n\nMacNeil wrote several books, including two memoirs \"The Right Place at the\nRight Time\" and the best seller \"Wordstruck,\" and the novels \"Burden of\nDesire\" and \"The Voyage.\"\n\n\"Writing is much more personal. It is not collaborative in the way that\ntelevision must be,\" MacNeil told The Associated Press in 1995. \"But when\nyou're sitting down writing a novel, it's just you: Here's what I think,\nhere's what I want to do. And it's me.\"\n\nMacNeil also created the Emmy-winning 1986 series \"The Story of English,\" with\nthe MacNeil-Lehrer production company, and was co-author of the companion book\nof the same name.\n\nAnother book on language that he co-wrote, \"Do You Speak American?,\" was\nadapted into a PBS documentary in 2005.\n\nIn 2007, he served as host of \"America at a Crossroads,\" a six-night PBS\npackage exploring challenges confronting the United States in a post-9/11\nworld.\n\nSix years before the 9/11 attacks, discussing sensationalism and frivolity in\nthe news business, he had said: \"If something really serious did happen to the\nnation \u2014 a stock market crash like 1929, ... the equivalent of a Pearl Harbor\n\u2014 wouldn't the news get very serious again? Wouldn't people run from `Hard\nCopy' and titillation?\"\n\n\"Of course you would. You'd have to know what was going on.\"\n\nThat was the case \u2014 for a while.\n\nBorn in Montreal in 1931, MacNeil was raised in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and\ngraduated from Carleton University in Ottawa in 1955 before moving to London\nwhere he began his journalism career with Reuters. He switched to TV news in\n1960, taking a job with NBC in London as a foreign correspondent.\n\nIn 1963, MacNeil was transferred to NBC's Washington bureau, where he reported\non Civil Rights and the White House. He covered the assassination of President\nJohn F. Kennedy in Dallas and spent most of 1964 following the presidential\ncampaign between Kennedy's successor, Lyndon Johnson, and Republican Barry\nGoldwater.\n\nIn 1965, MacNeil became the New York anchor of the first half-hour weekend\nnetwork news broadcast, \"The Scherer-MacNeil Report\" on NBC. While in New\nYork, he also anchored local newscasts and several NBC news documentaries,\nincluding \"The Big Ear\" and \"The Right to Bear Arms.\"\n\nMacNeil returned to London in 1967 as a reporter for the British Broadcasting\nCorp.'s \"Panorama\" series. While with the BBC, be covered such U.S. stories as\nthe clash between anti-war demonstrators and the Chicago police at the 1968\nDemocratic Convention, and the funerals of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.,\nSen. Robert Kennedy and President Dwight Eisenhower.\n\nIn 1971, MacNeil left the BBC to become a senior correspondent for PBS, where\nhe teamed up with Lehrer to co-anchor public television's Emmy-winning\ncoverage of the Senate Watergate hearings in 1973.\n\n\u00a9 NPR\n\n", "frontpage": false}
