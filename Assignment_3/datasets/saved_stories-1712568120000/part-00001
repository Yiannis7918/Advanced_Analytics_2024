Steele\n\nNovember 9, 2015\n\nBy Trey Ratcliff/StuckinCustoms.com.\n\nNot long ago I was waiting for a domestic flight in a departure lounge at one\nof the crumbling midcentury sheds that pass for an American airport these\ndays. There were delays, as we\u2019ve all come to expect, and then the delays\nturned into something more ominous. The airplane I was waiting for had a\nserious maintenance issue, beyond the ability of a man in an orange vest to\naddress. The entire airplane would have to be taken away for servicing and\nanother brought to the gate in its place. This would take a while. Those of us\nin the departure lounge settled in for what we suspected might be hours. From\nthe window I watched the ground crew unload the bags from the original\nairplane. When the new one arrived, the crew pumped the fuel, loaded the bags,\nand stocked the galley. It was a scene I\u2019d witnessed countless times. Soon we\nwould board and be on the way to our destinations.\n\nAs for the first airplane, the one with the maintenance problem\u2014what was its\ndestination going to be? When you have time on your hands, you begin to wonder\nabout things like this. My own assumption, as yours might have been, was that\nthe aircraft would be towed to a nearby hangar for a stopgap repair and then\nflown to a central maintenance facility run by the airline somewhere in the\nU.S. Or maybe there was one right here at the airport. In any case, if it\nneeded a major overhaul, presumably it would be performed by the airline\u2019s\nstaff of trained professionals. If Apple feels it needs a \u201cGenius Bar\u201d at its\nstores to deal with hardware and software that cost a few hundred dollars, an\nairline must have something equivalent to safeguard an airplane worth a few\nhundred million.\n\n### Hive\n\nWhere Wall Street, Washington, and Silicon Valley meet.\n\nAbout this I would be wrong\u2014as wrong as it is possible to be. Over the past\ndecade, nearly all large U.S. airlines have shifted heavy maintenance work on\ntheir airplanes to repair shops thousands of miles away, in developing\ncountries, where the mechanics who take the planes apart (completely) and put\nthem back together (or almost) may not even be able to read or speak English.\nUS Airways and Southwest fly planes to a maintenance facility in El Salvador.\nDelta sends planes to Mexico. United uses a shop in China. American still does\nmuch of its most intensive maintenance in-house in the U.S., but that is\nlikely to change in the aftermath of the company\u2019s merger with US Airways.\n\nThe airlines are shipping this maintenance work offshore for the reason you\u2019d\nexpect: to cut labor costs. Mechanics in El Salvador, Mexico, China, and\nelsewhere earn a fraction of what mechanics in the U.S. do. In part because of\nthis offshoring, the number of maintenance jobs at U.S. carriers has\nplummeted, from 72,000 in the year 2000 to fewer than 50,000 today. But the\nissue isn\u2019t just jobs. A century ago, Upton Sinclair wrote his novel The\nJungle to call attention to the plight of workers in the slaughterhouses, but\nwhat really got people upset was learning how unsafe their meat was. Safety is\nan issue here, too. The Federal Aviation Administration is supposed to be\ninspecting all the overseas facilities that do maintenance for airlines\u2014just\nas it is supposed to inspect those in America. But the F.A.A. no longer has\nthe money or the manpower to do this.\n\nOne of the fastest-growing of the offshore repair sites is on the perimeter of\nEl Salvador\u2019s Monse\u00f1or \u00d3scar Arnulfo Romero International Airport. Named for\nthe archbishop who was assassinated during Mass in 1980, the airport has\nbecome a busy hub, owing largely to a steady influx of foreign jetliners\nneeding maintenance and repair. Jets flying the insignia of US Airways,\nSouthwest, Jet Blue, and many smaller American carriers are a common sight as\nthey touch down and taxi to the Aeroman complex at the edge of the field.\n\nAeroman was once the repair base for El Salvador\u2019s modest national airline. It\nhas mushroomed into a complex of five hangars, 18 production lines, and\nnumerous specialty shops that perform virtually all phases of aircraft\noverhaul. The company has picked up the familiar multi-national technobabble,\ndescribing itself as a \u201cworld leader in providing aircraft-maintenance\nsolutions.\u201d About 2,000 mechanics and other employees work in the company\u2019s\ntightly guarded airport compound, encircled by a fence and barbed wire.\n\nThe airplanes that U.S. carriers send to Aeroman undergo what\u2019s known in the\nindustry as \u201cheavy maintenance,\u201d which often involves a complete teardown of\nthe aircraft. Every plate and panel on the wings, tail, flaps, and rudder are\nunscrewed, and all the parts within\u2014cables, brackets, bearings, and bolts\u2014are\nremoved for inspection. The landing gear is disassembled and checked for\ncracks, hydraulic leaks, and corrosion. The engines are removed and inspected\nfor wear. Inside, the passenger seats, tray tables, overhead bins, carpeting,\nand side panels are removed until the cabin has been stripped down to bare\nmetal. Then everything is put back exactly where it was, at least in theory.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Kate Middleton\u2019s Cancer Diagnosis Announcement Video \u201cMay Not Adhere\u201d to News Service\u2019s Standards, Getty Warns\n\nBy Kase Wickman\n\n  * Feud\u2019s Truman Capote Doesn\u2019t Shine Like the Man I Knew\n\nBy Lawrence Grobel\n\n  * Is Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson Turning to the Right?\n\nBy Eve Batey\n\nRelated: The Human Factor\n\nThe work is labor-intensive and complicated, and the technical manuals are\nwritten in English, the language of international aviation. According to\nregulations, in order to receive F.A.A. certification as a mechanic, a worker\nneeds to be able to \u201cread, speak, write, and comprehend spoken English.\u201d Most\nof the mechanics in El Salvador and some other developing countries who take\napart the big jets and then put them back together are unable to meet this\nstandard. At Aeroman\u2019s El Salvador facility, only one mechanic out of eight is\nF.A.A.-certified. At a major overhaul base used by United Airlines in China,\nthe ratio is one F.A.A.-certified mechanic for every 31 non-certified\nmechanics. In contrast, back when U.S. airlines performed heavy maintenance at\ntheir own, domestic facilities, F.A.A.-certified mechanics far outnumbered\neveryone else. At American Airlines\u2019 mammoth heavy-maintenance facility in\nTulsa, certified mechanics outnumber the uncertified four to one. Because\nheavy maintenance is labor-intensive and offshore labor is cheap, there\u2019s a\nperception that the work is unskilled. But that\u2019s not true. If something as\nmundane as the tray of a tray table becomes unattached, the arms that hold it\ncould easily turn into spears.\n\nThere are 731 foreign repair shops certified by the F.A.A. around the globe.\nHow qualified are the mechanics in these hundreds of places? It\u2019s very hard to\ncheck. In the past, when heavy maintenance was performed on United\u2019s planes at\na huge hangar at San Francisco International Airport, a government inspector\ncould easily drive a few minutes from an office in the Bay Area to make a\nsurprise inspection. Today that maintenance work is done in Beijing. The\ninspectors responsible for checking on how Chinese workers service airplanes\nare based in Los Angeles, 6,500 miles away.\n\nLack of proximity is only part of the problem. To inspect any foreign repair\nstation, the F.A.A. first must obtain permission from the foreign government\nwhere the facility is located. Then, after a visa is granted, the U.S. must\ninform that government when the F.A.A. inspector will be coming. So much for\nthe element of surprise\u2014the very core of any inspection process. That\ninspections have had the heart torn out of them should come as no surprise. It\nis the pattern that has beset the regulation of drugs, food, and everything\nelse.\n\nA facility in El Salvador\n\nBy Rodrigo Flores/ImageBrief.\n\nWhat effect does all this offshoring have on the airworthiness of the fleet?\nNo one gathers data systematically on this question\u2014which is worrying in\nitself\u2014but you don\u2019t have to look far in government documents and news reports\nto find incidents that bring your senses to an upright and locked position. In\n2011, an Air France Airbus A340 that had undergone a major overhaul at a\nmaintenance facility used by U.S. and European airlines in Xiamen, China, flew\nfor five days with 30 screws missing from one of its wings. The plane traveled\nfirst to Paris and then to Boston, where mechanics discovered the problem. A\nyear earlier, an Air France Boeing 747 that had undergone major maintenance at\nanother Chinese facility was grounded after it was found that some of the\nplane\u2019s exterior had been refinished with potentially flammable paint.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Kate Middleton\u2019s Cancer Diagnosis Announcement Video \u201cMay Not Adhere\u201d to News Service\u2019s Standards, Getty Warns\n\nBy Kase Wickman\n\n  * Feud\u2019s Truman Capote Doesn\u2019t Shine Like the Man I Knew\n\nBy Lawrence Grobel\n\n  * Is Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson Turning to the Right?\n\nBy Eve Batey\n\nIn 2013, yet another Air France aircraft, this one an Airbus A380 en route to\nCaracas from Paris, had to make an unscheduled landing in the Azores when all\nthe toilets overflowed and two of the airplane\u2019s high-frequency radios failed.\nThe Air France pilots\u2019 union said the incidents occurred on the airplane\u2019s\nfirst commercial flight after heavy-maintenance work in China. The company\nthat performed the work also does maintenance for American. (Air France has\ndenied that the problems were associated with maintenance done in China.)\n\nYou don\u2019t have to look far to find incidents that bring your senses to an\nupright and locked position.\n\nIn 2009, a US Airways Boeing 737 jet carrying passengers from Omaha to Phoenix\nhad to make an emergency landing in Denver when a high-pitched whistling sound\nin the cabin signaled that the seal around the main cabin door had begun to\nfail. It was later discovered that mechanics at Aeroman\u2019s El Salvador facility\nhad installed a key component of the door backward. In another incident,\nAeroman mechanics crossed wires that connect the cockpit gauges and the\nairplane\u2019s engines, a potentially catastrophic error that, in the words of a\n2012 Congressional Research Service report, \u201ccould cause a pilot to shut down\nthe wrong engine if engine trouble was suspected.\u201d\n\nIn 2007, a China Airlines Boeing 737 took off from Taiwan and landed in\nOkinawa only to catch fire and explode shortly after taxiing to a gate.\nMiraculously, all 165 people on board escaped without serious injury.\nInvestigators later concluded that during maintenance work in Taiwan mechanics\nhad failed to attach a washer to part of the right wing assembly, allowing a\nbolt to come loose and puncture a fuel tank. China Airlines does maintenance\nwork for about 20 other carriers.\n\nRelated: Everything You Need to Know About Flying Virgin Galactic\n\nAirline mechanics at U.S. airports who perform routine safety checks and\nmaintenance tasks before an airplane takes off report that they are\ndiscovering slipshod work done by overseas repair shops. American Airlines\nmechanics contended in a lawsuit last January that they had been disciplined\nby management for reporting numerous safety violations they uncovered on\nairplanes that had recently been serviced in China. Mechanics in Dallas said\nthey had discovered cracked engine pylons, defective doors, and expired oxygen\ncanisters, damage that had simply been painted over, and missing equipment,\namong other violations. An American spokesperson denied the allegations,\ncontending that the airline\u2019s \u201cmaintenance programs, practices, procedures and\noverall compliance and safety are second to none.\u201d Citing a lack of\njurisdiction, a federal judge dismissed the lawsuit. The F.A.A., however, is\ninvestigating the allegations.\n\nWith huge subsidies, the Chinese government has created an aircraft-\nmaintenance industry almost from scratch\u2014building hangars, hiring mechanics,\nand aggressively courting airlines to have work done in the People\u2019s Republic.\nEven engine repairs and overhaul\u2014the highly skilled aircraft-maintenance work\nthat has remained largely in the U.S. and Europe\u2014may follow heavy maintenance\nto the developing world. Emirates, the airline owned by the Gulf states, is\nconstructing a $120 million state-of-the-art engine-repair-and-overhaul\nfacility in Dubai.\n\nA 2007 explosion, traced to maintenance in Taiwan\n\nBy Yomiuri/Reuters/Landov.\n\nNot everyone in official Washington is oblivious to what has been happening.\nThe inspector general\u2019s office of the Department of Transportation has\nrepeatedly called for the F.A.A. to demand more stringent reporting\nrequirements. It needs to know where maintenance work is being done, and by\nwhom. In 2003, the inspector general called on the F.A.A. to require drug\ntesting of workers at foreign repair stations as a condition of F.A.A.\ncertification. Twelve years later, the agency still has no such requirement.\nSimilarly, there are no mandatory security checks for workers at foreign\nairplane-repair stations. In 2007, workers on a Qantas jet undergoing heavy\nmaintenance in Singapore were reportedly members of a work-release contingent\nfrom a nearby maximum-security prison, though the airline denied the\nallegation.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Kate Middleton\u2019s Cancer Diagnosis Announcement Video \u201cMay Not Adhere\u201d to News Service\u2019s Standards, Getty Warns\n\nBy Kase Wickman\n\n  * Feud\u2019s Truman Capote Doesn\u2019t Shine Like the Man I Knew\n\nBy Lawrence Grobel\n\n  * Is Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson Turning to the Right?\n\nBy Eve Batey\n\nIn addition to sending work offshore, airlines are also outsourcing more\nmaintenance work\u2014including heavy maintenance\u2014to private contractors in the\nU.S. Many of the issues that plague the foreign shops\u2014unlicensed mechanics,\nworkers who don\u2019t speak English, and poor workmanship\u2014are also present at some\nof these private American repair shops. The F.A.A. at least has the capability\nto inspect domestic facilities more frequently than it does those overseas.\n(Despite frequent attempts, the F.A.A. did not respond to requests for\ninformation or comment on the issues raised in this story.)\n\nThe reality is that from now on it\u2019s going to be up to the airlines to police\nthemselves. With the F.A.A. starved for funds, it will be left to the airlines\nto oversee the heavy maintenance of their aircraft. Have you noticed that this\nsort of arrangement never works? The F.A.A.\u2019s flight-standards office in\nSingapore\u2014the only field office it maintained in the entire developing\nworld\u2014once had half a dozen inspectors responsible for visiting more than 100\nrepair stations in Asia: not enough, to put it mildly, but they could\naccomplish something. By 2013 the number of inspectors was down to one. Now\nthere is no one at all.\n\nAnd I will confess that thinking about all this in the departure lounge puts\nthe prospect of endless delay into perspective. Yes, I\u2019ll happily wait a\nlittle longer to board my flight\u2014and then hope for the best.\n\n# James B. Steele\n\nSee More By James B.
