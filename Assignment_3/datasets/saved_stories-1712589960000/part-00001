Virginia\nutilities do not have the energy or transmission capacity to handle the\nenormous increases in energy consumption. Dominion Energy projects a doubling\nof CO2 and a new fossil fuel buildout. Drinking water sources are imperiled.\n\nThe governor is unfazed. Legislators are going to study the matter.\n\nSource: PJM\n\nAccording to data gathered by regional grid operator PJM, half of the coming\nsurge will occur in parts of Virginia served by Dominion Energy. In its 2023\nIntegrated Resource Plan (IRP), Dominion said it would meet the higher demand\nby increasing its use of expensive and highly polluting fossil fuels and\nbuilding new methane gas-fired generating plants. Dominion admitted this will\npush up carbon emissions at a time when the Virginia Clean Economy Act\nrequires the utility to build renewable energy and cut carbon.\n\nPJM projects equally huge data center growth in areas served by Virginia\nelectric cooperatives, especially Northern Virginia Electric Cooperative\n(NOVEC). The cooperatives are exempt from most VCEA requirements, and NOVEC\nbuys the bulk of its power from PJM\u2019s fossil fuel-heavy wholesale market.\nNOVEC\u2019s latest annual report cites load growth of 12% per year, almost\nentirely from data centers, but fails to even mention the increase in carbon\nemissions that will accompany that growth.\n\nUndeterred by these alarming statistics, the General Assembly put the growth\non steroids with a new round of tax breaks in 2023, while beating back any\nconditions that might have slowed the onslaught. This year it turned away\nevery bill that would have placed limits on the industry or protected ordinary\nconsumers from the inevitable cost increases.\n\nAt the same time, legislators rejected a host of bills that would have enabled\nmore renewable energy development in Virginia and given customers a greater\nability to secure their own electricity supply. Together these bills could\nhave brought thousands of megawatts of new solar projects online, lowered\ndemand growth through increased energy efficiency, and prevented the increases\nin carbon pollution that now appear inevitable.\n\nLegislators did greenlight Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power\u2019s ability to\nspend their customers\u2019 money on initial development efforts for two nuclear\nreactors of up to 500 megawatts (MW), one for each utility.\n\nThis is not a fix. It is like scheduling knee surgery for next year when you\nare having a heart attack today.\n\nThere is, famously, much doubt about whether small modular reactors (SMRs)\nwill prove viable in the coming decades, but there is no doubt whatsoever that\nthe surge in data center development is happening right now. Virginia\u2019s hoped-\nfor nuclear renaissance would be both too little and too late to meet a data\ncenter demand that Dominion says grew by 933 MW in 2023 alone. It\u2019s expected\nto reach almost 20,000 MW by 2034, the year Dominion\u2019s IRP shows its first\nsmall nuclear reactor delivering power.\n\nIn rejecting every serious measure to address data center demand, General\nAssembly leaders said they wanted to wait for a study being conducted this\nyear by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC). What the\nGeneral Assembly didn\u2019t do was defer new data center development until the\nstudy is complete. Another year has to pass before lawmakers will even\nconsider bills addressing land use, power and water concerns around data\ncenters or make it easier for renewable energy to come online.\n\nThe consequences of inaction could be deadly. It was only a year ago that\nVirginia\u2019s Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) proposed allowing certain\nNorthern Virginia data centers to violate their air quality permits by running\nmore than 4,000 highly-polluting diesel generators during periods of grid\nstress. It doesn\u2019t take much imagination to picture the public health disaster\nwe\u2019d have had if 4,000 diesel generators kicked into operation last summer\nwhen smoke from Canadian wildfires had already made Virginia air quality\nhazardous.\n\n> Building more Virginia data centers requires increased pollution controls\n\nDEQ backed off its proposal after a massive public outcry, but the idea is\nlikely still percolating at the agency and might reemerge as an emergency\ndemand-response measure. Even without allowing the generators to provide grid\nsupport, more data centers with more diesel generators will worsen air quality\nwith every power outage and every round of equipment testing.\n\nAs I argued at the time, the diesel generator fiasco could have been avoided\nin the first place if data centers had been equipped with renewable energy\nmicrogrids and battery storage. DEQ\u2019s decision not to require battery storage\nas the first line of defense against power outages deprived Dominion of a\ndemand-response option that would have been far cleaner and more useful than\ndiesel generators.\n\nOne of the bills the General Assembly rejected this year would have prohibited\nthe use of backup diesel generators by data centers that receive state tax\nsubsidies, and would have required greater energy efficiency. It was a missed\nopportunity that means the problem can only get worse in the coming year.\n\nThe governor, however, could still avert the crisis by imposing a pause in\ndata center development while the JLARC study is underway. He could accomplish\nthis through an executive order directing the Virginia Economic Development\nPartnership (VEDP) not to enter a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with any\ndata center operator until the JLARC study is complete and legislators have\nhad the opportunity to act on it. These MOUs are a requirement for data center\noperators to access Virginia\u2019s generous tax exemptions. Without the tax\nsubsidies, most data center developers would likely choose not to pursue\ndevelopment here.\n\nThis is not a novel idea. Last spring, data center reform advocates asked VEDP\nto include stringent efficiency and siting conditions in MOUs it entered with\nAmazon Web Services. They never got an answer.\n\nDown in Georgia, however, legislators just passed a Republican-led bill to\nsuspend that state\u2019s data center tax subsidies for two years pending the\nresults of a study of grid capacity. Legislators expressed concern about\nGeorgia Power\u2019s ability to provide electricity to all the data centers that\nwant to come to the state. And as Republican Sen. John Albers also noted, \u201cThe\nreality is these do not create many jobs. They create big buildings, but they\ndo not create jobs.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, the Georgia tax subsidies were modeled on the ones Virginia\nimplemented in 2010, which pushed our data center growth into overdrive. Isn\u2019t\nit interesting that Georgia lawmakers so quickly learned a lesson that\nVirginia leaders refuse to even acknowledge?\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons\nlicense CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.
