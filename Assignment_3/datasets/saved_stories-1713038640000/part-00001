Around the clock, the plant\nsucks the heated water back up to power generators. Since last November, this\ncarbon-free, Earth-borne power has been flowing onto a local grid in Nevada.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE\n\nFood & Environment\n\n### Nuclear\u2019s role in a net-zero world\n\nTechnology\n\n### The road to low-carbon concrete\n\nTechnology\n\n### How wind turbines could coexist peacefully with bats and birds\n\nGeothermal energy, though it\u2019s continuously radiating from Earth\u2019s super-hot\ncore, has long been a relatively niche source of electricity, largely limited\nto volcanic regions like Iceland where hot springs bubble from the ground. But\ngeothermal enthusiasts have dreamed of sourcing Earth power in places without\nsuch specific geological conditions \u2014 like Project Red\u2019s Nevada site,\ndeveloped by energy startup Fervo Energy.\n\nSuch next-generation geothermal systems have been in the works for decades,\nbut they\u2019ve proved expensive and technologically difficult, and have sometimes\neven triggered earthquakes. Some experts hope that newer efforts like Project\nRed may now, finally, signal a turning point, by leveraging techniques that\nwere honed in oil and gas extraction to improve reliability and cost-\nefficiency.\n\nThe advances have garnered hopes that with enough time and money, geothermal\npower \u2014 which currently generates less than 1 percent of the world\u2019s\nelectricity, and 0.4 percent of electricity in the United States \u2014 could\nbecome a mainstream energy source. Some posit that geothermal could be a\nvaluable tool in transitioning the energy system off of fossil fuels, because\nit can provide a continuous backup to intermittent energy sources like solar\nand wind. \u201cIt\u2019s been, to me, the most promising energy source for a long\ntime,\u201d says energy engineer Roland Horne of Stanford University. \u201cBut now that\nwe\u2019re moving towards a carbon-free grid, geothermal is very important.\u201d\n\n## A rocky start\n\nGeothermal energy works best with two things: heat, plus rock that is\npermeable enough to carry water. In places where molten rock sizzles close to\nthe surface, water will seep through porous volcanic rock, warm up and bubble\nupward as hot water, steam or both.\n\nIf the water or steam is hot enough \u2014 ideally at least around 300 degrees\nFahrenheit \u2014 it can be extracted from the ground and used to power generators\nfor electricity. In Kenya, nearly 50 percent of electricity generated comes\nfrom geothermal. Iceland gets 25 percent of its electricity from this source,\nwhile New Zealand gets about 18 percent and the state of California, 6\npercent.\n\nSome natural geothermal resources are still untapped, such as in the western\nUnited States, says geologist Ann Robertson-Tait, president of GeothermEx, a\ngeothermal energy consulting division at the oilfield services company SLB.\nBut by and large, we\u2019re running out of natural, high-quality geothermal\nresources, pushing experts to consider ways of extracting geothermal energy\nfrom areas where the energy is much harder to access. \u201cThere\u2019s so much heat in\nthe Earth,\u201d Robertson-Tait says. But, she adds, \u201cmuch of it is locked inside\nrock that isn\u2019t permeable.\u201d\n\nThe Lardarello plant in the Tuscany region of Italy, shown here in a photo\nfrom the 1950s, was the first geothermal power plant in the world. It was\ncompleted in 1913.\n\nCREDIT: UNIVERSAL IMAGES GROUP NORTH AMERICA LLC / ALAMY STOCK PHOTO\n\nTapping that heat requires deep drilling and creating cracks in these non-\nvolcanic, dense rocks to allow water to flow through them. Since 1970,\nengineers have been developing \u201cenhanced geothermal systems\u201d (EGS) that do\njust that, applying methods similar to the hydraulic fracturing \u2014 or fracking\n\u2014 used to suck oil and gas out of deep rocks. Water is pumped at high pressure\ninto wells, up to several miles deep, to blast cracks into the rocks. The\ncracked rock and water create an underground radiator where water heats before\nrising to the surface through a second well. Dozens of such EGS installations\nhave been built in the United States, Europe, Australia and Japan \u2014 most of\nthem experimental and government-funded \u2014 with mixed success.\n\nFamously, one EGS plant in South Korea was abruptly shuttered in 2017 after\nhaving probably caused a 5.5 magnitude earthquake; fracking of any kind can\nadd pressure to nearby tectonic faults. Other issues were technological \u2014 some\nplants didn\u2019t create enough fractures for good heat exchange, or fractures\ntraveled in the wrong direction and failed to connect the two wells.\n\nSome efforts, however, turned into viable power plants, including several\nGerman and French systems built between 1987 and 2012 in the Rhine Valley.\nThere, engineers made use of existing fractures in the rock.\n\nBut overall, there just hasn\u2019t been enough interest to develop EGS into a more\nreliable and lucrative technology, says geophysicist Dimitra Teza of the\nenergy research institute Fraunhofer IEG in Karlsruhe, Germany, who helped\ndevelop some of the Rhine Valley EGS systems. \u201cIt has been quite tough for the\nindustry.\u201d\n\nGeothermal electricity has long been limited to volcanic regions where\nunderground heat is easily accessible. But new kinds of power plants are\nmaking it possible to derive geothermal heat elsewhere in the world.\n\n## New momentum\n\nSolutions exist for both safety and technological problems. There are, in\nfact, robust protocols for avoiding earthquakes, such as by not drilling near\nactive faults. Long-term monitoring of the operating EGS plants in France and\nGermany has documented only minor tremors, building confidence in the safety\nof the technology. Importantly, drilling and fracking methodology has improved\nby leaps and bounds, thanks to the boom in oil and gas extraction from shale\nrocks that began in the 2010s. \u201cSince then, we\u2019ve seen a renewed interest in\nEGS as a concept, because the techniques that are central to EGS were\nperfected and brought down significantly in cost during that time,\u201d says\nWilson Ricks, an energy systems researcher at Princeton University.\n\nIn 2015, for instance, the US Department of Energy launched a research site in\nUtah dedicated to advancing EGS technologies. Several new North American\nstartups, including Sage Geosystems and E2E Energy Solutions, are developing\nnew EGS systems in Texas and Canada, respectively. The most advanced is Fervo\nEnergy, which has applied several techniques from the shale industry at its\nNevada plant, which now supplies a local grid that includes energy-sucking\ndata storage centers owned by Google. (Google partnered with Fervo to develop\nthe plant.)\n\nEngineers drilled almost 8,000 feet downward into the Nevada rock, reaching\ntemperatures of nearly 380 degrees Fahrenheit, and then, at the bottom,\ndrilled another 3,250-foot horizontal well to expand the area of hot rock that\nthe system touches \u2014 a technique used in oil and gas extraction in order to\nmaximize yield. The company also fractured the surrounding rock at several\nsites along the horizontal well to create a more extensive web of cracks for\nwater to trickle through. Technologically speaking, compared to earlier EGS\nefforts, \u201cthey are, in fact, a big step forward,\u201d says Horne, who is on\nFervo\u2019s scientific advisory board.\n\nThe geothermal power plant \u201cProject Red\u201d in Nevada, developed by startup Fervo\nEnergy, has been working on methods that could make geothermal a more\nwidespread electricity source.\n\nCREDIT: FERVO ENERGY\n\nIt remains to be seen how these new EGS systems perform in the long term. One\nadvantage of systems like Fervo\u2019s is that they can be made more profitable by\ntaking advantage of energy price fluctuations, according to recent research by\nRicks, a Princeton colleague and several experts at Fervo Energy. Operators\ncould plug the exit wells, causing water to accumulate inside the system,\nbuilding up pressure and heat. Then the energy could be extracted during times\nwhen it is most valuable \u2014 such as during cloudy or windless periods when\nsolar or wind aren\u2019t working.\n\nStill, such systems would have to be significantly scaled up to be\ncommercially viable, Ricks says. Although Project Red claims a larger capacity\nthan any other EGS plant \u2014 3.5 megawatts, enough to power more than 2,500\nhomes \u2014 it\u2019s still relatively small; a nuclear or coal plant can easily have\nan output of 1,000 megawatts, while large solar or traditional geothermal\nplants often produce several hundred megawatts.\n\nWhat the EGS field needs right now, Ricks says, is the funding to build and\ntest more such systems to inspire investor confidence. \u201cThis all needs to be\nvery well proven, out to the point where the perceived risk is low,\u201d he says.\n\nStay in the Know Sign up for the Knowable Magazine newsletter today\n\n## A turning point for geothermal?\n\nTo that end, the US Department of Energy recently awarded $60 million in\nfunding to three demonstration projects for EGS and related technologies as\npart of a broader initiative to speed up EGS development. One 2019 report from\nthe agency estimated that, with advances in EGS, geothermal power could\nrepresent around 60 gigawatts (60,000 megawatts) of installed capacity in the\nUnited States by 2050, generating 8.5 percent of the country\u2019s electricity \u2014 a\nmore-than-20-fold increase from today.\n\nEven an increase of a few percent could aid in a global energy transition\nthat\u2019s aiming to get to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. \u201cIf in fifteen,\ntwenty years, EGS is viable, I think it could play a huge part,\u201d says Nils\nAngliviel de La Beaumelle, who recently coauthored an article on the global\noutlook for renewable energy in the Annual Review of Environment and\nResources.\n\nOther geothermal technologies may also help. Some companies are exploring the\nfeasibility of \u201csuper hot rock\u201d geothermal \u2014 essentially, a young, extreme\nvariant of EGS that involves drilling down even deeper into Earth\u2019s crust, to\na depth where water reaches a \u201csupercritical\u201d vapor-like state that allows it\nto carry much more energy than either steam or liquid. In southern Germany,\nthe energy company Eavor is building the world\u2019s first \u201cclosed-loop\u201d\ngeothermal system: Once pipes funnel water into the deep rock, the system fans\nout into a network of parallel boreholes, without water ever penetrating the\nrock. That\u2019s a more predictable \u2014 albeit less efficient \u2014 way of warming\nwater, as it doesn\u2019t involve uncertainties around fracturing the rock in the\nright way, Teza says. \u201cI\u2019m really excited to see that there\u2019s investment into\nthese technologies,\u201d she says. \u201cI think it can only help.\u201d\n\nOn the whole, it\u2019s an important moment for geothermal energy \u2014 and not just\nfor providing carbon-free electricity, Robertson-Tait says. Geothermal brines\nhauled out of the Earth are rich in lithium and other critical minerals that\ncan be used to build green technologies like solar panels and EV batteries.\nThere\u2019s a growing push to use direct geothermal heat to warm buildings, either\nthrough shallow heat pumps for residential buildings or larger systems\ndesigned for entire districts \u2014 like Paris and Munich already have.\n\nSome oil and gas companies, recognizing that a change is coming, are\nincreasingly interested in building geothermal systems of various kinds, says\nRobertson-Tait. \u201cOur Earth is geothermal,\u201d she says, \u201cand so I think we owe it\nto ourselves to do everything we can to use it.\u201d\n\n10.1146/knowable-041124-2\n\nKatarina Zimmer is a science and environment journalist currently based in\nGermany.
