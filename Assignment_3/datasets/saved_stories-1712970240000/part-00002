How It Works\n\nClassroom Technology\n\n# This AI Tool Cut One Teacher\u2019s Grading Time in Half. How It Works\n\nBy Alyson Klein \u2014 April 10, 2024 4 min read\n\nE+\n\n  * Save to favorites\n\n  * Print\n\nEmail Facebook LinkedIn Twitter Copy URL\n\nIt usually takes Aimee Knaus, who has been teaching computer science for more\nthan two decades, upwards of two hours to grade a classful of coding projects.\n\nThis school year, she cut that time roughly in half, with the help of an AI\nteaching assistant developed by Code.org, a nonprofit organization that aims\nto expand access to computer science courses, and the Piech Lab at Stanford\nUniversity in Palo Alto, Calif.\n\nKnaus, who teaches middle school in Kimberly, Wis., was one of twenty teachers\nnationwide who tested the computer science grading tool\u2019s capability on about\na dozen coding projects also designed by Code.org, as part of a limited pilot\nproject.\n\n## See Also\n\nCurriculum Opinion Data Science Is the Future. Let's Start Teaching It\n(Opinion) The subject needs to be part of rigorous math prep leading to\ncollege and careers, argues Freakonomics author Steven D. Levitt.\n\nBeginning today, Code.org is inviting an additional 300 teachers to give the\ntool a try.\n\nIn early testing by Knaus and other teachers, the tool\u2019s assessment of student\nwork closely tracked those of experienced computer science teachers, said\nKarim Meghji, the chief product officer at Code.org. If that trend holds\nthrough this larger trial, the nonprofit hopes to make the tool widely\navailable to computer science teachers around the country, he said.\n\nMeghji would ideally like the tool to become widely available by the end of\nthe calendar year, but the timeline will depend on the results of the broader\ntesting.\n\n## \u2018I worry AI couldn\u2019t push my students to the next level\u2019\n\nMany educators see helping teachers tackle time-consuming but relatively rote\ntasks\u2014like grading\u2014as a huge potential upside of AI. Curriculum company\nHoughton Mifflin Harcourt\u2019s Writable tool, Essaygrader, Gradescope, and others\nhave already been released. And some teachers have experimented with using\nChatGPT, an AI-powered writing and research tool, to grade papers.\n\nBut others are wary of outsourcing grading\u2014especially on assignments that call\nfor making subjective decisions about students\u2019 writing or ideas.\n\n\u201cAfter all these years, I\u2019ve worked to perfect my feedback and my process,\u201d\nsaid Carly Ghantous, a humanities instructor at Davidson Academy Online, a\nprivate virtual school. \u201cI worry that the AI wouldn\u2019t be able to push my\nstudents to the next level of writing\u201d as well as an experienced teacher\ncould.\n\nBy contrast, the criteria for grading the coding projects that the computer\nscience tool examined are cut and dry, Meghji explained.\n\nThe AI tool must determine whether a student\u2019s coding project contains certain\nrequirements\u2014for instance, whether there are at least two changeable elements.\nThat\u2019s something the technology figures out quickly and accurately.\n\nMegjhi predicts that, down the road, AI tools could frequently be tapped to\nhelp grade student work. Given the technical nature of computer science, it\nmakes sense that the subject would be among the first out of the gate, he\nadded.\n\n\u201cI think we have a unique situation with computer science and coding,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cI do think that assessment will become an AI-assisted task for teachers\nacross multiple subjects. I can\u2019t say what that\u2019s gonna look like for English\nor for social studies or other subjects. But I can tell you that I do think\nbased on what I\u2019ve seen in computer science that there is there\u2019s definitely\nan opportunity for broader application.\u201d\n\n## \u2018I had the answer key, but I didn\u2019t know what I was doing\u2019\n\nGrading computer science tasks can be particularly tricky\u2014and time consuming,\nMeghji said, which is why Code.org was interested in exploring possible AI\nsolutions.\n\nMany teachers who lead computer science courses don\u2019t have a degree in the\nsubject\u2014or even much training on how to teach it\u2014and might be the only\neducator in their school leading a computer science course.\n\nKevin Barry, a former social studies teacher, was tapped to teach computer\nscience at his southern Maryland high school by a principal who noticed\nBarry\u2019s facility with technology. Barry, who is one of a hundred educators who\ngave Code.org information to inform the development of its tool, hasn\u2019t yet\ntested the product for himself.\n\nStill, he already wishes that something like it had existed when he first\nstepped into the computer science teaching role nearly ten years ago.\n\nBack then, \u201cit took me even longer to grade because I didn\u2019t know what I was\ngrading,\u201d said Barry, who teaches at La Plata High School. \u201cI was learning it\nas I was doing it with the students. I had the answer key, but I didn\u2019t know\nwhat I was doing.\u201d\n\nThese days, the tool could help him challenge his highest flyers\u2014giving Barry\nextra time to help those who may be struggling.\n\nIn his classes, \u201cI\u2019ve had the captain of the robotics team [and a] kid who\nlives on a farm and barely knows what the power buttons are,\u201d along with 28\nother students whose abilities are somewhere in between those extremes, Barry\nsaid.\n\n\u201cI have more advanced students that want to go on\u201d to trickier projects, Barry\nsaid. If the tool was able to examine their work, \u201cthey can be working three\nassignments down the road.\u201d\n\n## \u2018We should still always be the ones in control\u2019\n\nKnaus agrees that the tool could be a huge time-saver for teachers. She\u2019s\ninterested in seeing it go beyond grading, offering real-time feedback or\nassistance to students as they work on coding assignments.\n\nKnaus was surprised by how in sync the tool\u2019s assessment of student work\nseemed to be with her own. But if she disagreed with the tool\u2019s estimation of\nan assignment, she wouldn\u2019t hesitate to ignore the AI tool\u2019s recommendation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that it necessarily is going to always be completely accurate,\u201d\nKnaus said. \u201cWhen we think about AI, I think it\u2019s really important for humans\nto understand that we should still always be the ones in control.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we want to get to the point where we trust AI\u201d over our own\nknowledge, she concluded.\n\nAlyson Klein\n\nAssistant Editor, Education Week\n\nAlyson Klein is an assistant editor for Education Week.\n\n  * twitter\n  * email\n\nRelated Tags:\n\nArtificial Intelligence Grading Computer Science Wisconsin\n\n## Most Popular Stories\n\nE+ / Getty\n\nTeaching Student Apathy Is a Big Classroom Challenge, Teachers Say.
