This insanity has ruined far\ntoo many lives and the castle built on a foundation of lies is crumbling\nrather quickly.\n\nBut the truth is there has never been any \u201cscience\u201d or logical rationale to\nsupport the notion of a \u201ctrans child\u201d or the transitioning of minors. The\nentire concept of transgenderism was bunk from the getgo, as called out\ndecades ago by feminists like Germaine Greer and Sheila Jeffreys.\n\nThe Same Drugs is a reader-supported publication.

Had most bothered to be brave rather\nthan to protect their reputations and incomes, there would have been no\n\u201cgender clinics\u201d to review and report on, and the WPATH Files and the Cass\nReview would have been unnecessary, because duh.\n\nA child is never born in the wrong body. A boy who likes dresses is not\nactually a girl. The way for kids to truly be themselves is not to put them on\nhormones and chop off their healthy body parts. Sterilizing minors is not\n\u201clife-saving health care.\u201d Puberty sucks but it\u2019s a necessary part of human\ndevelopment.\n\nThis has always been true and those of us willing to say so did, and were\nignored, vilified, and censored.\n\nBut the good liberals shut their ears and went along with it because they\nweren\u2019t willing to lose social status, income, friends, or jobs. They let the\nrest of us suffer for things they are now suddenly piping up about, as though\nthis is new information.\n\nIf I sound bitter it\u2019s because I am.\n\nTruly, what we have collectively allowed to happen is a scandal and a travesty\nof epic proportions. And now that evidence is being compiled in reports that\ncannot be ignored, showing the the \u201cscience\u201d behind transing kids is not\nthere, things are being rolled back \u2014 the Tavistock gender clinic closed\npermanently at the end of March, Alberta is moving to prevent minors from\naccessing puberty blockers and hormones, numerous European countries have\nhalted so-called \u201cgender medicine\u201d for minors, both the New York Times and the\nWashington Post have published articles acknowledging there is a lack of\nevidence supporting the need for medical interventions to deal with youth\n\u201cgender issues\u201d and the reality of regret for those who are put on this path\ntowards \u201ctransition\u201d \u2014 people are playing rational. Oh, well now that the\nscience is in, perhaps we should reconsider doing dangerous, life-destroying\nmedical experiments on kids...\n\nYou think??\n\nDid we ever need fucking science or evidence to prove that boys are not\nactually girls on the inside or that preventing kids from going through\npuberty is dangerous?\n\nI am terribly sorry for my non-celebratory, crass attitude, but it\u2019s difficult\nto be thrilled when so much damage has been done, completely unnecessarily. We\ndidn\u2019t need to do this experiment to learn that transing kids is a\nreprehensible practice, because the entire concept of \u201ctrans kids\u201d has always\nbeen bunk.\n\nWhy did anyone go along in the first place? Why are those claiming to be\ncritical of \u201cgender medicine\u201d for minors still using the language supporting\nthe practice? Why are gender critical journalists still talking about \u201ctrans\nkids\u201d and using \u201cpreferred pronouns\u201d? What exactly are you criticizing if you\nare still supporting the notion that these barbaric practices and these insane\nlies are legitimate or necessary? Are we meant to trust the \u201crational\ncriticisms\u201d of those too afraid to tell the truth? Or treat people as leaders\nwho don\u2019t seem to actually understand this issue at all?\n\nWhy are people still pretending as though they don\u2019t know the truth, which is\nthat there are only two sexes, and it is impossible to switch. Why are full\ngrown adults who know exactly what it\u2019s like to be a kid \u2014 having been one\nthemselves at some point \u2014 pretending as though things that are perfectly\nnormal must somehow be \u201ctreated\u201d as \u201cconditions\u201d?\n\nI realize that those tasked with producing these kinds of reports, like\nHillary Cass, are working within a limited framework and attempting to get\nthrough to people who believe wholeheartedly something called a \u201ctrans kid\u201d\nexists and that the only way for that individual to survive and thrive is by\npretending it is possible to turn them into the opposite sex. I realize they\nare working backwards, against people who are convinced that there is\n\u201cscience\u201d supporting the concept of \u201cgender dysphoria\u201d and that without\nmedical \u201ctreatment\u201d those who suffer from \u201cgender dysphoria\u201d are at risk of\nbeing miserable or suicidal. I realize that many likely believe the best way\nto address and stop the immense harms caused by giving puberty blockers and\nhormones to minors is to ease people into a change of mind, using evidence-\nbased reports.\n\nTo me, though, leaving the underpinnings of transgenderism hanging out there\nin legitimacy is at the root of the problem, and the reason we are in this\npickle at all. Treating this as an issue of \u201cscience\u201d is also a problem. No\none needs scientific reports to understand obvious truth.\n\nA key conclusion in the Cass Report explains:\n\n> There remains diversity of opinion as to how best to treat these...young\n> people. The evidence is weak and clinicians have told us they are unable to\n> determine with any certainty which children and young people will go on to\n> have an enduring trans identity.\n\nTerms like \u201cgender-related distress,\u201d \u201cgender care for children,\u201d \u201cgender\ndysphoria,\u201d \u201cpediatric gender-transition treatment,\u201d \u201cgender incongruence,\u201d\nand \u201cgender-questioning young people\u201d are used throughout the report, not just\nconfusing the situation, but in fact justifying the reason the clinics exist\nin the first place. How productive is it to question the transitioning of kids\nwhile also conceding the basis of the \u201ctransition\u201d?\n\nCass explains, \u201cFor most young people, a medical pathway will not be the best\nway to manage their gender-related distress\u201d and that \u201cThe rationale for early\npuberty suppression remains unclear, with weak evidence regarding the impact\non gender dysphoria, mental or psychosocial health.\u201d\n\nThese assessments are true and important. But there is a problem with framing\nthe very normal experiences of kids going through puberty as \u201cgender-related\ndistress\u201d or \u201cgender dysphoria.\u201d\n\nHow one feels, whether child or adult, about \u201cgender\u201d is relevant to nothing\nand no one. Every single youth in the world struggles with confusion or\ndistress as their body goes through puberty. These are not exactly comfortable\nchanges. Many boys like playing with dolls or wearing dresses, and many girls\nlike \u201cboy things.\u201d When I was a kid I refused to wear the girls\u2019 ballet outfit\nand insisted on the boys\u2019 uniform instead. I hated all \u201cgirl\u201d things, wanted\nto play with the boys, and taught myself to pee standing up. Not once did\nanyone treat this as abnormal, and not once did I feel \u201cdistressed\u201d about any\nof this. This was perfectly normal kid stuff, and everyone knew it, myself\nincluded. The idea that a girl who feels or behaves exactly as I and countless\nother girls have, over eons, needs \u201cservices\u201d is ridiculous.\n\nLeave the kids alone.\n\nStop imposing adult politics, ideologies, academic ideas, jargon, and\nperversions on kids.\n\nI appreciate that these reports are being done because they have to be, but I\ndon\u2019t appreciate that they have to be done.\n\nI don\u2019t appreciate that we let this get so far out of hand, when we could have\nall just spoken the truth the moment anyone suggested a \u201ctrans kid,\u201d or at\nvery least supported the women who did.\n\nI have had enough of this. I have had enough of this for years. I will never\nforgive those who ignored the women fighting this with all their might, who\ndistanced themselves from us, who abandoned us, or who went along with the\nsilencing, censorship, and vilification. I will never forgive those who stayed\nsilent when they could have spoken out. Or when they could have simply donated\nmoney, or a venue, or a platform, or protection. I will not look at those men\nstanding up now and demanding to know why they are the \u201conly ones speaking up\nabout this\u201d and asking \u201cwhere are all the women on this\u201d as brave leaders. I\nwill not pretend away truth and reality in a fight for truth and reality and I\nwill not allow men to rewrite history to suit their wallets and egos. I will\nnot allow women who refused to come on my podcast or who demanded I remove\ntheir articles and content from my website or YouTube channel because they\ndidn\u2019t want to be associated with a \u201cTERF,\u201d as it might negatively impact\ntheir career.\n\nHere is how we win this fight: we say no. To all of it. To \u201cpreferred\npronouns,\u201d to \u201ctransgenderism,\u201d to \u201ctrans people,\u201d to \u201ctrans kids,\u201d to \u201cgender\ndysphoria\u201d and to the notion that one\u2019s personality, clothing preferences,\nfeelings about one\u2019s body or about gender stereotypes, or fetishes is an\nimportant part of one\u2019s identity that must for some reason be \u201cexpressed\u201d in\npublic and \u201cvalidated\u201d by every stranger on the planet.\n\nWe tell the truth and we stop pretending the truth is rude. We listen, with\nrespect, to those women who have refused to compromise on any of this and stop\npainting them as \u201ctoxic extremists,\u201d \u201cradicalized\u201d toward the cruelty of\npointing out that men are not women.\n\nAs soon as I realized what was going on and saw what was happening to the\nwomen pushing back, I spoke up, I stood up, and I supported those women\npublicly. Anyone could have done the same. And those who chose not to, and\nthose continuing to play it safe now, are not people who deserve our respect\nor trust.\n\nThe TERFs were right, and they\u2019re still right.\n\nFuck the experts. The experts failed us. Fuck the science. We don\u2019t need\nscience to know what every human has known for all of humanity. Fuck the\nmedia. Fuck the New York Times and the CBC for reporting clownfish ideology\nand for refusing to platform the women pushing back. Fuck the platforms that\nwent along with all of this and are now publishing scientists as though you\nneed a scientist to tell you that the term \u201cassigned sex at birth\u201d is stupid.\nFuck every single one of my friends who unfriended me on Facebook or told me\nthey couldn\u2019t hang out with me anymore or attacked me for being \u201cmean\u201d because\nit was so very important to them that children be mutilated and sterilized. I\nwas not bad, I am not bad, you are bad.\n\nThe TERFs were right, and they\u2019re still right. Say it loud and never forget\nit.\n\nGive a gift subscription\n\nPurchase tickets for the first ever event discussing gender identity, women\u2019s\nspaces, and parental rights in Victoria, B.C. on May 30th at tickettailor.com.\n\nThe Same Drugs is a reader-supported publication.
