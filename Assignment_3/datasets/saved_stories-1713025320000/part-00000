I talked myself out of it for months, pretending the time\nwasn't right and I was too busy, or that I hadn't done enough research. When I\nran out of links to click and pictures to examine, I finally accepted that it\nwas now or never. If I really wanted it, I would need to stop thinking about\nit and simply do it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVertical clitoral hood (VCH) piercings are the most popular female genital\npiercings, because of the quick healing time its natural conformity to the\nanatomical shape of the wearer. Aside from its aesthetic value, the VCH\npiercing increases clitoral stimulation during sexual activity and offers the\npossibility of more pleasure. The piercer places a surgical-steel bar (similar\nto those used in belly button piercings) through the little covering of skin\nthat protects the clitoris so that one steel ball at the end of the bar is\nvisible to the naked eye, while the other rests gently on top of a woman's\nclitoris under the little skin flap.\n\nObsessive by nature, I took my investigation into the world of genital\npiercings very seriously\u2014I wanted to be absolutely sure before I began poking\nholes down there. At first, I encountered horror stories of women who went in\nfor clitoral hood piercings and came out with nerve damage, caused by\ninexperienced piercers who permanently maimed their clients by piercing the\nclitoris along with the hood. While my insides clenched at the thought of\nbeing stabbed through my clitoris, I was relieved to find out that these cases\nof butchery were rare, and there were a surprising number of genital piercers\nwith excellent reviews in my area.\n\n> What if someone at the piercing place laughs at me? Will I ever be able to\n> cross my legs again?\n\nAfter months of explicit internet searches, I decided that I loved the way\nthey looked: delicate and feminine, but with an undeniable edge. And the\nprospect of having better sex and more intense orgasms was certainly\nintriguing. As far as piercings went, the VCH was also affordable: with an\napproximate service fee of $40 and a jewelry cost between $20 and $40, a VCH\npiercing would cost only a few dollars more than a belly button or tongue\nring.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough enthusiastic to get the piercing, I was still too ashamed to tell\nanyone aside from my boyfriend what I was doing. While 72 percent of American\nwomen have piercings of some kind, only 2 percent have piercings on the\ngenitals. I'm a nice, normal girl. And we nice, normal girls just don't do\nthings like pierce our vaginas\u2014which is probably why the National Health\nService in the UK now views consensual vaginal piercings as a crime, and why\nsome doctors treat women with genital piercings less favorably.\n\nBesides those concerns, my anxieties about the piercing were too personal to\nshare: What if I lose all sensation and it ruins sex forever? What if someone\nat the piercing place laughs at me? Will I ever be able to cross my legs\nagain? Will it show through my pants? What if I hate it?\n\nI also grappled with my existence as a straitlaced, disciplined athlete who\nhad never misbehaved in any major way in her entire life. I wondered how I\nmight come to terms with what I saw as a transgression from my own identity,\neagerly welcoming wildness into my otherwise orderly life. I wasn't the kind\nof person who did these sorts of things. And yet, I wanted so badly to get\nthis piercing.\n\nThe author\n\nEarly one Saturday afternoon I gritted my teeth and hailed a taxi, determined\nto go through with it. In the cab, I reminded myself that whatever happened, I\nwould (most likely) return alive and could easily pretend the whole episode\nhad never occurred. After all, I hadn't told anybody what I was doing in the\nfirst place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs I approached my destination, my cheeks burned with insecurity. I briefly\nwondered why I was even there, doing something I shouldn't in a place where I\ndidn't belong. Tucking my chin and folding my arms, I did my best to look\nsmall (not an easy task at over six feet tall) as I exited the cab. I saw the\nglass storefront of the piercing parlor and hustled to the safety of its\ncloud-colored walls.\n\nI scuttled inside and approached the counter, brimming with false confidence.\nI still felt painfully out of place; this piercing parlor, in spite of its\nspa-like motif, was no different than any other. There really wasn't a nice,\nquiet place for normal girls like me to get their vaginas pierced.\n\n\"Hi there, what can I help you with today?\"\n\nThe receptionist had a jewel-embossed piercing the size of a dime in the space\nbetween her chin and her bottom lip that sparkled when she talked.\n\n\"Hi, I'd like to get a VCH piercing?\"\n\nOn the word \"piercing\" my voice hitched and rose, squeaking out a question in\nplace of the confident declaration that I intended. I used the piercing's\nabbreviated name to sound sophisticated, and mostly to avoid saying\n\"clitoral.\" I was intensely uncomfortable with the word clitoris, even when I\nwas asking another person to pierce the skin above mine.\n\nThe receptionist prepared paperwork and invited me to browse the jewelry,\nwhere I scrutinized each piece. I refused to decorate my lady-bits with\nanything plastic, colored, or cheap-looking, though I appreciated the irony in\nwanting a \"classy\" genital piercing. I settled on a plain steel bar with a\ncubic zirconium stone on the visible ball end of the jewelry. I filled out my\nconsent forms as the receptionist rattled off information:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"As I'm sure you know, we sterilize all of our equipment in an autoclave to\navoid infections. You'll go over aftercare instructions and payment with your\npiercer after you're all done, but it'll be about $75 today. Please sign here\nto indicate that you understand all of our policies and procedures. Your\npiercer today will be Ed; he'll come get you when he's all set.\"\n\nA man. A man would be touching my vagina, poking a hole in it! The only men to\never even see that part of my body were my ex and current boyfriend, and now a\nperfect stranger who was a man would not only see me; he would also pierce me.\nI knew in the corner of my mind that I could probably wait a little longer and\nask for a female piercer instead, but such a prudish request would be too\nhumiliating. As far as I was concerned, the kind of girl who got her clitoral\nhood pierced was not the kind of girl who cared about the gender of her\npiercer. I would maintain the fa\u00e7ade of being that kind of girl if it killed\nme.\n\n> The cotton swab's aggressive intrusion into the most sensitive part of my\n> anatomy felt foreign and heavy. Was this how my piercing would feel?\n\n\"Gen?\"\n\nI looked up and saw Ed shuffle out to greet me, a gentle smile on his face. He\nwas a short, overweight Hispanic man with a close beard and dreadlocks on the\nparts of his head that weren't shaved. Like everyone else in the shop aside\nfrom me, his face was amply decorated with rings, bars, and glittering studs.\nHe looked a lot friendlier than I was expecting. I followed him into a\nprocedure room that looked like a doctor's office, only its padded table was\nblack and only half the length. I perched on the edge and dangled my legs as\nEd and I chatted about my piercing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I'm going to ask you to take your pants and underwear off, and lay down on\nthe table with your legs in a butterfly position when we get started.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's fine, that's what my waxer has me do!\" My nerves induced me to\nover-share, but Ed wasn't fazed.\n\n\"Great, and so at that point I will take a look and see if you're anatomically\nsuited for the piercing. I wouldn't worry about this. Most women are. From\nthere we will use a needle receiving tube under your clitoral hood, or NRT, to\nplace the jewelry.\"\n\nI almost interjected again to declare that I knew all that already. From my\nextensive research, I knew that the NRT technique was the most advanced way of\nperforming a VCH piercing, and I presumed that I knew exactly what to expect\nin the piercing process. Instead of speaking, I simply nodded and smiled as Ed\ntalked me through everything in his soft, understanding voice. I wondered if\nEd was gay. He had a maternal tone and the touch of an experienced nurse, and\nthough I usually consider myself too progressive to just assume a person's\nsexual orientation, I unquestioningly accepted my presumptions of Ed's same-\nsex inclinations. It felt less uncomfortable to have my vagina examined by a\ngay man than to lie spread-eagled in front of a straight one.\n\nI took off my pants and underwear and climbed onto the table as Ed instructed,\ncrossing my arms over my chest and watching him as he prepared his tools. He\nheld up a cotton swab with the soft cotton removed, saying, \"I'm going to\ncheck your hood now to make sure we can do the piercing; I'll be placing this\nthrough the opening of your hood and it will be resting on your clitoris where\nthe jewelry will sit. OK?\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"OK,\" I squeaked as he turned his attention from my face to my vagina. I\nsuppressed the urge to giggle at the word hood and stared at the ceiling. I\nfelt intense pressure and the pull of the cotton swab on my skin, and my eyes\nwidened. It hurt more than I thought it would. The cotton swab's aggressive\nintrusion into the most sensitive part of my anatomy felt foreign and heavy.\nWas this how my piercing would feel?\n\n\"The opening of your hood is a little tight, but you're suited for the\npiercing! I'm going to get started.\"\n\nI felt the cottonless cotton swab withdraw and the coldness of iodine in its\nplace. I put my hands to my face and exhaled deeply. As Ed worked, I\nconsidered the absurdity of discussing the tightness of my hood with a strange\nman. I shivered with pent-up nervous laughter.\n\nAll humor quickly evaporated as I felt the same pressure as with the cotton\nswab, followed by a sharp stab of pain. I wrinkled my nose and squinted\nagainst it, careful not to move my lower body.\n\nThe pain faded to a powerful sting as Ed secured my jewelry and swabbed off\nthe remainder of the iodine. In less than a minute, it was done.\n\n> He handed me a mirror, and I speechlessly took it and angled my newly\n> ornamented anatomy into view... I loved it.\n\n\"You doing OK, Gen? That wasn't so bad, was it?\"\n\nI could hear the reassuring smile in his voice as he spoke, and I wanted to\nslap him. He wasn't allowed to be cheerful while I was still suffering from\nthe shock of what had just transpired.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I'm OK... Yeah, that hurt more than I was expecting, 'cause everything I saw\nonline said it was so easy\u2014that it was just a little pinch because the skin\ndown there is so thin...\" My voice felt weak, emptied of all its energy from\nthe unexpected pain.\n\n\"Here's a mirror so that you can take a look at it. What do you think?\"\n\nHe handed me a mirror, and I speechlessly took it and angled my newly\nornamented anatomy into view. I held my breath while I peeked, and exhaled\nslowly as I took in the unadulterated appearance of my own body.\n\nI loved it. It looked exactly like all the pictures I'd spent so many minutes\nstaring at. And I'd made the perfect choice with the cubic zirconium; my\npiercing had just the right amount of sparkle.\n\nScared to touch it, I handed the mirror back to Ed, beaming at the results of\nwhat had been a perilous journey for me. I walked gingerly to the corner and\nhailed a cab, incredibly pleased with myself for having the courage to\nactually go through with it.\n\nThree weeks later, my piercing was almost completely healed. I had already\ngotten enthusiastic approval from my boyfriend in a very exhibitionistic Skype\ncall, where he declared it \"really hot.\" I was discovering how to move, sit,\nstand, and bathe in new ways to avoid disturbing the tender, healing skin and\nthe powerful sensation that flared any time I so much as nudged the piercing.\nAll sexual activity was forbidden for at least four weeks, so I had yet to\ninvestigate claims of enhanced pleasure.\n\nAs I learned how to navigate my newly adorned body, I gave up trying to\nnavigate my own silly binary of what was \"normal\" and what wasn't. I wasn't as\nsimple and straightforward as I had once thought. I was my own version of a\nnice, normal girl: one who happened to have her vagina pierced.\n\nRead more stories about piercings on VICE.com.\n\nTagged:piercingsVice BlogclitorisVCH piercingvertical clitoral hood\npiercinggenital piercingsnice normal girls\n\n### ONE EMAIL.
