It is of particular interest to linguists as they view\nit as a unique opportunity to study what many view to be the birth of a new\nlanguage.\n\n## History[edit]\n\nBefore the 1970s, a deaf community largely socializing with and amongst each\nother was not present in Nicaragua. [^[2]] Deaf people were generally isolated\nfrom one another and mostly used simple home sign systems and gesture\n(m\u00edmicas) to communicate with their families and friends, though there were\nseveral cases of idioglossia among deaf siblings.^[3] The conditions necessary\nfor a language to arise occurred in 1977, when a center for special education\nestablished a scheme which was initially attended by 50 deaf children. The\nnumber of pupils at the school (in the Managua neighborhood of San Judas) then\ngrew to 100 by 1979, the beginning of the Sandinista Revolution.\n\nIn 1980 a vocational school for deaf adolescents was opened in the Villa\nLibertad area of Managua. By 1983 more than 400 deaf pupils were enrolled in\nthe two schools. Initially the language scheme emphasized spoken Spanish and\nlipreading, and the use of signs by teachers was limited to fingerspelling\n(using simple signs to sign the alphabet).\n\nThe scheme achieved little success, with most pupils failing to grasp the\nconcept of Spanish words. The children subsequently remained linguistically\ndisconnected from their teachers, but the schoolyard, the street, and the\nschool bus provided fertile ground for them to communicate with one another.\nBy combining gestures and elements of their home-sign systems, a pidgin-like\nform and a creole-like language rapidly emerged \u2014 they were creating their own\nlanguage. The \"first-stage\" pidgin has been called Lenguaje de Signos\nNicarag\u00fcense (LSN) and is still used by many who attended the school at the\ntime.^[when?]\n\nStaff at the school, unaware of the development of this new language, saw the\nchildren's gesturing as mime and a failure to acquire Spanish. Unable to\nunderstand what the children were saying, they asked for outside help. In June\n1986 the Nicaraguan Ministry of Education contacted Judy Kegl, an American\nSign Language linguist from MIT. As Kegl and other researchers began to\nanalyze the language they noticed that the young children had taken the\npidgin-like form of the older children to a higher level of complexity, with\nverb agreement and other conventions of grammar. The more complex sign\nlanguage is now known as Idioma de Se\u00f1as de Nicaragua (ISN).\n\nFrom the beginning of her research until Nicaraguan Sign Language was well\nestablished, Kegl carefully avoided introducing the sign languages that she\nknew, in particular American Sign Language, to the deaf community in\nNicaragua.^[4] A type of linguistic imperialism had been occurring\ninternationally for decades, in which individuals would introduce ASL to\npopulations of deaf people in other countries, often supplanting existing\nlocal sign languages. Kegl's policy was to document and study rather than to\nimpose or change the language or its community. Whilst she did not interfere\nwith deaf Nicaraguans gaining exposure to other sign languages, she did not\nintroduce such opportunities. She has, however, documented contact and\ninfluences with other sign languages that have occurred since the 1990s.\nCritics, such as Felicia Ackerman, have taken issue with the ethics of\nisolating the Nicaraguan children.^[5]\n\nKegl's organization, Nicaraguan Sign Language Projects, helped establish a\ndeaf school staffed entirely by deaf Nicaraguan teachers and has supported\ndeaf Nicaraguans in attending and presenting at international conferences.^[6]\n\n## Linguistics[edit]\n\nISN offers a rare opportunity to study the emergence of a new language. Before\nISN, studies of the early development of languages had focused on creoles,\nwhich develop from the mixture of two (or more) distinct communities of fluent\nspeakers. In contrast, ISN was developed by a group of young people with only\nnon-conventional home sign systems and gesture.\n\nSome linguists, such as Kegl^[7] and R. J. Senghas,^[8] view the sign language\ndevelopment in Managua as proof that language acquisition is hard-wired inside\nthe human brain. Steven Pinker, author of The Language Instinct, claims that\n\"The Nicaraguan case is absolutely unique in history ... We've been able to\nsee how it is that children\u2014not adults\u2014generate language, and we have been\nable to record it happening in great scientific detail. And it's the only time\nthat we've actually seen a language being created out of thin air.\"\n\nSince 1990, other researchers including Ann Senghas, Marie Coppola, Richard\nSenghas, Laura Polich and Jennie Pyers, have begun to study and report on the\ndevelopment of this unique language and its community. Since then, whilst\nresearchers have their own interpretations of the events leading to the\nlanguage and its development since, all agree that to date, the phenomenon\nbeing studied is one of the richest sources of data on language emergence\ndiscovered.\n\n## Structure[edit]\n\nBierma^[9] provides a good foundation to ISN structures. He takes as an\nexample \"rolling down\". While a person may visualize this as one motion, ISN\nsplits this action into two parts, manner and direction. These smaller parts\nallow for them to be rearranged to create different phrases. The most\nsophisticated speakers use an A-B-A speech pattern; in our example, this\nreflects the signs roll-down-roll, to note that the rolling down motion is\ncontinuous, not that the subject rolled and then descended.\n\n### Spatial modulation[edit]\n\n\"See\" (a) and \"Pay\" (b), produced in a neutral direction and spatially\nmodulated to the signer's left\n\nSpatial modulations are the building blocks of all sign languages studied to\ndate. A neutrally placed sign is in front of the chest; however, a sign can be\nmodulated, or directionally altered, to convey many grammatical changes.\n\nSpatial modulations can perform functions including \"indicating person or\nnumber; providing deictic, locative, or temporal information; or indicating\ngrammatical relationships\".^[10]\n\nIn the article written by Senghas and Coppola, they explore spatial modulation\nas it occurs in ISN. They found that this movement from the neutral space was\nmuch more common among signers who began learning at a younger age than their\npeers who did so when they were older. Taking this into consideration (as well\nas their studies on spatial modulations for indicating shared reference and\nthe speed at which signers at different stages of learning signed), Senghas\nand Coppola determined that child learners are creating Nicaraguan Sign\nLanguage \u2013 they \"changed the language as they learned it\".^[11] The fact that\nstudents who began signing at a younger age use spatial modulation more often\nthan their older peers, who began signing at ISN's conception, is indicative\nthat the language matures as the younger cohorts make the grammar more\ncomplex. They go on to note that it is only when a language is not matured,\nsuch as with ISN, that language-learning abilities show their transformational\nand creative capacity.\n\nIn the signing space, the use of pointing to indicate referent identity has\nincreased greatly since the 1980s. Points can serve a \"pronoun-like function,\ncoordinating with the spatial modulations to verbs, to indicate the argument\nstructure of the sentence, and to co-index referents across\ndiscourse\".^[12]^[full citation needed]\n\nIllustration of unrotated and rotated representation of a giving event. The\nlocation is compared with the man's location in the event to determine the\nrotation of the representation.\n\nSenghas and Coppola have noted that signers who learned ISN before the\nExtensive Contact Period (before 1983) were inconsistent in whether an event\nwas represented as rotated or reflected (unrotated) in the signing space. If\nthe signer was watching an event where a man on the signer's left gave an\nobject to a woman on the signer's right, it was at random (when the signer\nreiterated the scene) whether or not the signer would use spatial modulation\nto mark left and right based on his view from in front of the scene or as if\nthe signer were facing the same way as the actors in the scene.\n\nSigners who began learning after 1983 were not inconsistent in that way.\nAcross multiple signers and multiple scenes, signers would apply the same\nrotated representation. Senghas and Coppola suggested that this meant that\n\"spatial modulations are being used as a shared grammatical element among this\nage cohort\".^[13]\n\n## Academic interpretation[edit]\n\n### When it became language[edit]\n\nResearchers disagree regarding at what stage in the development of ISN it\nbecame a full-fledged language.\n\n  * Coppola argues that isolated family-signed systems in Nicaragua contained components that can be called linguistic (but that does not mean she equates home sign with language).\n  * Kegl argues that following an intermediate stage when deaf contact gesturers came together and developed a communication sufficient to make young children think their input was a language to be acquired, the first generation of young children acquired a language as complete and rich as any human language known to date; subsequent changes constitute an expected process of historical change.\n  * Senghas argues that once ISN came into being, it became more and more complex over successive cohorts of young acquirers.\n\n### Evidence for innate language capacities[edit]\n\nWilliam Stokoe, known by many as the father of American Sign Language\nlinguistics, disagreed that the emergence of ISN is evidence of a language\nacquisition device. Stokoe also questions assertions that the language has\nemerged entirely without outside influence from, for example, Spanish or\nASL.^[14] There is so far no final evidence available to resolve the\ncontroversy surrounding nativism v. cultural learning, and the dispute reaches\nfar into theoretical linguistics, the approaches of which may conceptualize\ngrammar in different and incompatible ways. Even if the evidence collected\nseems to indicate a lack of access to Spanish and ASL in the early emergence\nprocess, the possibility remains that the development of ISN is facilitated by\nthe speaker's exposure to more general communicative strategies in early\ninfancy.\n\nAlternatives to theories proposing a language acquisition device have been\npresented by Michael Tomasello (among others).^[citation needed] Tomasello\nargues that the process of acquiring a first language is boosted by non-\nlinguistic communication, as in the establishment of joint intentional frames\nand in the understanding of communicative intentions.^[15]\n\nIn any case, once ISN came into being, like other languages it actively\nengaged in contact with languages in its environment.\n\n### As \"unwritable\"[edit]\n\nR. J. Senghas (1997) used the phrase \"unspeakable, unwritable\" language in the\ntitle of his dissertation to highlight the common misconception that those\nlanguages without a written form are not as \"real\" (a view often held by those\nwho do not study indigenous languages). In a similar fashion, sign languages\nare often not given proper recognition because they are not spoken or written.\n(Senghas has never claimed that Nicaraguan Sign Language is unwritable, just\nthat it was often thought of as such by those who do not study sign\nlanguages.)\n\nGenerally, the influence literacy has on the status of a language is also\naddressed in debates of the so-called \"written language paradigm\" in which it\nis acknowledged that the availability of written language to some extent must\nbe considered as a culturally and historically dependent phenomenon. Tim\nIngold, a British anthropologist, discussed these matters at some length in\nPerception of the Environment (2000), though he does not specifically deal\nwith ISN. Since 1996, however, Nicaraguans have been writing their language by\nhand and on computer using SignWriting. There are now many texts written in\nNicaraguan Sign Language, including three volumes of reading lessons in ISN,\nSpanish I and II (two levels of texts, workbooks and primers), Cuentos\nEspa\u00f1oles (a collection of stories in Spanish with ISN glossaries), and a\ngeography text.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Nicaragua portal\n\n  * Deafness in Nicaragua\n  * Adamorobe Sign Language\n  * Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language\n  * Kata Kolok\n  * Martha's Vineyard Sign Language\n  * Yucatec Maya Sign Language\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Nicaraguan Sign Language at Ethnologue (18th ed., 2015) (subscription required)\n  2. ^ Polich, L.
