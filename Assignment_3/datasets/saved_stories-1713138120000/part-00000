says it is sticking with tried-and-true tech for its October mission\nto an icy moon of Jupiter.\n\nBy Jason Nelson\n\nApr 13, 2024Apr 13, 2024\n\n8 min read\n\nAn animation of the Europa Clipper approaching Jupiter's Europa Moon.

The Europa Clipper\u2019s\nmission is engineered to document the Jovian moon and assess its habitability.\nIt will conduct detailed reconnaissance, study the icy surface and subsurface\nocean, search for signs of life, and analyze the moon's composition and\ngeology.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe media day began at the NASA/JPL visitor center, where we checked in with\nsecurity, issued our badges, and met with our guides.\n\n(Image: Jason Nelson/Decrypt)\n\nBoarding a tour bus, we headed to the building where the Europa Clipper was\nhoused and began entering \u201cthe clean room.\u201d\n\n## Meeting the Europa Clipper\n\nGetting ready to enter the Europa Clipper warehouse was an interesting\nexperience. First, we were told to walk across an adhesive mat that would\nremove any dirt or lingering particles from our shoes.\n\nAfter cleaning our shoes, we turned over all equipment we planned to take into\nthe warehouse to be cleaned before the gear was returned to us. Next, we were\ntaken into a room filled with gowns and protective gear to suit up.\n\n(Image: Jason Nelson/Decrypt)\n\nAfter suiting up, the last step before entering the clean room was to take an\nair shower to give us a last once-over to remove any dust or particles. As we\nentered the warehouse where the Europa Clipper was housed, the first thing I\nnoticed was how big the room was.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll need every inch of this space when all of the pieces to the Europa\nClipper are put into place, and it\u2019s time to move the unit out,\u201d a member of\nthe quality assurance team told Decrypt, pointing to the high ceiling.\n\n(Image: Jason Nelson/Decrypt)\n\n## How it's made\n\nMy first impression of the Europa Clipper was how delicate it looked, but the\nteam of engineers told me that the orbiter is built to take a punch.\n\n(Image: Jason Nelson/Decrypt)\n\n\u201cWe treat it delicately, and then we take it to a shaker that simulates the\nlaunch condition and shakes the craft really hard,\u201d JPL Harness Engineer Luis\nAguila told Decrypt. \u201cThat makes sure that everything is secure, nothing's\ngoing to break along the way, and then we test it again after that,\u201d he said,\nnoting that the team performed the vibration testing earlier this year.\n\nAguila also noted that the total weight of the Europa Clipper tops 13,000\npounds.\n\nAccording to Europa Clipper Project Manager Jordan Evans, the shape and design\nare intentional and serve multiple purposes.\n\n\u201cThe shape is driven by a variety of things: it has to fit inside the rocket,\nand the rocket only has a five-meter diameter (approximately 16.4 feet), so\neverything\u2014including the solar arrays\u2014have to fit,\u201d Evans told Decrypt. \u201cThen,\nas we do each flyby, different science instruments need to look down at the\nsurface of the moon.\u201d\n\nMore Videos\n\n0 seconds of 4 minutes, 45 secondsVolume 90%\n\nPress shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcuts\n\nKeyboard Shortcuts\n\nShortcuts Open/Close/ or ?\n\nPlay/PauseSPACE\n\nIncrease Volume\u2191\n\nDecrease Volume\u2193\n\nSeek Forward\u2192\n\nSeek Backward\u2190\n\nCaptions On/Offc\n\nFullscreen/Exit Fullscreenf\n\nMute/Unmutem\n\nDecrease Caption Size-\n\nIncrease Caption Size+ or =\n\nSeek %0-9\n\nNext Up\n\nHow Mino Games is Using Artificial Intelligence\n\n01:21\n\nLive\n\n00:00\n\n04:45\n\n04:45\n\n## NASA\u2019s Next Deep Space Mission Won\u2019t Use Artificial Intelligence\n\nOn Thursday, Decrypt Media visited NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in\nPasadena, CA to meet with the Engineering team behind the Europa Clipper\nbefore its launch to Jupiter's Europa moon in October.\n\nInterviews\n\nApr 13, 2024\n\n4m 45s\n\nGo to video page\n\nEvans explained that some instruments are positioned to face the direction the\ncraft is flying because they are designed to analyze the moon's atmosphere.\nOther instruments need to be isolated from the spacecraft to avoid\ninterference. Evans emphasized that each instrument has specific requirements\nthat must be integrated into the Europa Clipper\u2019s design.\n\nThe design of the Europa Clipper, Evans said, involves a complex process of\nbalancing these requirements to ensure that one does not negatively impact\nanother, leading to the final design of the spacecraft.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGetting the data that Europa Clipper collects back to Earth takes a three-\nmeter (approximately 9.84 feet) high gain antenna mounted on top of the\nspacecraft.\n\n(Image: NASA/JPL)\n\n\u201cThat goes to the Deep Space Network, which is also run by the Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory,\u201d Evans said. \u201cSo no matter where Jupiter and Europa Clipper are\nrelative to Earth, one of the ground stations around the Earth has a direct\nline of sight to the spacecraft,\u201d he said, adding that the craft is able to\nsend the data through the large antenna back to those on the ground.\n\n## AI and space exploration\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has played a significant role in recent space\nexploration endeavors. In October, a group of scientists and astronomers from\nNorthwestern University reported using AI to identify and classify supernovae\nin real-time.\n\nWhile artificial intelligence is playing a growing role in space exploration\nand NASA/JPL projects, Evans said Europa Clipper does not use AI in any\nmeaningful way.\n\n\u201cIt doesn't\u2014you can think of it more like a standard computer,\u201d added Tracy\nDrain, the Flight Systems Engineer. \u201cThere's software that runs on board where\nthings are fully programmed in to tell it what to do.\u201d\n\nEverything the spacecraft needs to operate must be on board since accessing\nthe cloud on Earth would mean a 52-minute delay each way.\n\nAfter visiting the Europa Clipper and going through the process of taking off\nall of the protective gear, we took a shuttle bus to the von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n auditorium\nto learn more about the facility and the mission.\n\n## High-tech history\n\n(Bust of Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n in the lobby of the von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n auditorium)\n(Image: Jason Nelson/Decrypt)\n\nFounded in 1943, JPL traces its history back to the 1930s with the work of a\ngroup of California Institute of Technology (Caltech) students, teachers, and\nenthusiasts dubbed the \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d by their peers. The Suicide Squad\nincluded American aeronautical engineer Frank Malina, Hungarian aerospace\nengineer Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n, and rocket scientist, chemist, and occultist\nJohn Whiteside \u201cJack\u201d Parsons.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n(Suicide Squad Members from left to right: Fred S. Miller, Jack Parsons, Ed\nForman, Frank Malina) (Image: NASA/JPL)\n\nIn December 1958, JPL was folded into the newly founded NASA.\n\nAfter visiting the Europa Clipper and going through the process of taking off\nall of the protective gear, we took a shuttle bus to the von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n\nauditorium. The space was lined with posters and displays from NASA/JPL\nmissions past and present, including Voyager, Cassini, and, of course, the\nEuropa Clipper.\n\n(Image: Jason Nelson/Decrypt)\n\n## Look, don't touch\n\n\u201cThe main goal is to search for an environment that could support life, not a\nlife detection mission,\u201d JPL Deputy Project Scientist Bonnie Buratti told\nDecrypt. \u201cWe are looking for an environment where life could form and be\nsustained.\u201d\n\nWhile the surface of Europa appears to be covered in ice, Buratti said, unlike\nthe ice world in the 2014 Christopher Nolan film, \u201cInterstellar,\u201d it is\nunclear if the moon\u2019s surface is safe to land or walk on.\n\nAs Buratti explained, evidence suggests visible sediment deposits, possibly\nplume deposits, forming a fragile surface. These distinct layers might conceal\ncrevasse that could be fallen into that remaining hidden.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that we're going to look for is activity because if you\nlook at that picture of Europa, it looks like there are not a lot of craters\non it,\u201d Buratti said. \u201cThere has been active geology in the last at least 50\nmillion years, which is a blink of an eye in geologic time.\u201d\n\nAs Buratti explained, if the Europa Clipper does discover signs of life on the\nmoon, it\u2019s not a call for concern but for more exploration, acknowledging that\nlanding on the lunar surface is not an option at this time.\n\n\u201cRight now, NASA does not plan to land on Europa,\u201d Burrata said. \u201cBut if we\ndid find anything that was suggestive of life, again, it's not a mission to\nlook for that we\u2019re looking for environments that could sustain life; I think\nNASA would probably plan to send [another mission] there.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n## Debrief\n\nVisiting the Jet Propulsion Laboratory was an amazing experience, and for a\nlife-long fan of space exploration and history, it was like Christmas had come\nearly. When asked how a student in middle school or high school who is\ninterested in science and space could get a job at JPL, Drain said the door\nwas open to everyone.\n\n\u201cMy favorite thing to tell kids is that you don't have to be an engineer or a\nscientist to do this kind of work,\u201d Drain said, emphasizing critical thinking\nas a key skill. \u201cIf you are interested in arts, journalism, computer science,\nand finance, there are so many ways that you can end up working here doing\nthings that are related to space.\u201d\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa.\n\n### Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.\n\nIPFSIPFS\n\n### Recommended News\n\n  * ## AI or Human?
