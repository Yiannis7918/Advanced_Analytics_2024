Catching me by surprise in the release\nannouncement was:\n\n> \"Welcome to the APT 3.0 development series. It has a new UI for apt(8). It\n> has colors, columnar display, some more padding, and shows removals last\n> (Closes: #755088), making the output more easy to quickly scan.\"\n\nCatching my interest, I decided to quickly try a test build of APT 2.9 on an\nUbuntu box.\n\nOoo yes APT is finally sporting colored text.\n\nI immediately loved the columnar format for the APT output. Paired with the\ncolors and columnar format, the new text UI is a big improvement over the\nlong-standing APT output.\n\nWhile just spending a few minutes with the new APT 2.9 build, it's a big\nimprovement in my perspective over how APT has long looked with its text user\ninterface. This will culminate with the APT 3.0 stable release but already the\ncoloring and columnar layout is a big improvement for quickly sorting through\nthe output when involving a long list of packages.\n\nIt's looking nice and I'm looking forward to APT 3.0. Downloads and more\ndetails on today's APT 2.9 release to Debian unstable via the v2.9\nannouncement.\n\n10 Comments\n\nRelated News\n\nDebian Policy 4.7 Outlines Latest Packaging/System Guidelines\n\nDebian 12.5 Released To Provide The Latest Security & Bug Fixes\n\nDebian 64-bit time_t Transition Underway For Addressing Y2038 Problem On\n32-bit Systems\n\nDebian Likely Moving Away From i386 In The Near Future\n\nDebian 12.4 Released With Dozens Of Fixes\n\nDebian 12.3 Delayed Due To An EXT4 Data Corruption Bug Being Addressed\n\nAbout The Author\n\nMichael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site\nin 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.
