His death was a tragic\naccident, but it had a root in rainforest politics.\n\nIssa Kanu died because chimpanzees escaped from a sanctuary in Sierra Leone.\nThe chimps needed that sanctuary because people had killed their parents and\ncaptured the youngsters to sell as pets. Poverty had propelled these people to\nhunt chimpanzees and widespread logging made it harder for the chimps to hide.\nTry explaining that to a child.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what author and illustrator Paul Glynn has done with his book\nKing Bruno, which he will launch in London on 6 February. It tells the true\nstory of how a legendary chimpanzee called Bruno was orphaned by hunters,\nlived among humans, survived encounters with soldiers during Sierra Leone\u2019s\ncivil war and then disappeared on a day of deep tragedy.\n\nThe story begins back in 1989. Accountant Bala Amarasekaran and his wife\nSharmila were in a small village 150 kilometres north of the capital Freetown\nwhen they saw a young male chimpanzee for sale. It looked sick so they paid\nUS$30 to rescue the animal and raised it in their home. They named it Bruno.\n\nBefore long they acquired a second chimpanzee they called Julie. But as the\napes grew bigger and stronger it became clear that they could not stay in a\nhuman home much longer. Jane Goodall, the world\u2019s foremost chimpanzee expert,\nagreed. She met Bala, Sharmila, Bruno and Julie in the early 1990s and sowed\nin Bala\u2019s mind the ideas of a sanctuary for Sierra Leone\u2019s orphan chimpanzees.\n\nIn 1995 the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry provided land in the Western\nArea Forest Reserve and funded staff to support Bala as he set up the Tacugama\nChimpanzee Sanctuary there. Within two years the centre was home to 24\nchimpanzees. Bruno was their boss. He was a giant among chimpanzees, around\n20-30 percent heavier than an average adult male. Here he is with Bala.\n\nKing Bruno describes how life in the sanctuary improved for the chimpanzees\nand how they even survived the dangers of the civil war, which ended in 2002.\nBombs fell nearby and soldiers twice raided the centre for supplies. Some even\nthreatened to shoot the chimpanzees, but Bruno\u2019s fame helped protect them.\nTragedy struck instead on 23 April 2006, when 31 chimpanzees escaped.\n\nFor taxi driver Issa Kanu and four other men it was a day of horror. Kanu\u2019s\npassengers that day were local man Melvin Mammah and three Americans \u2014 Alan\nRobertson, Gary Brown and Richie Goodie \u2014 who were sub-contractors working at\nthe site of the new US embassy about three kilometres away. The men had come\nto visit the sanctuary but as they drove along a forested back road, they came\nstraight into contact with the escaped apes.\n\nBruno charged. Then he smashed one of the car\u2019s windows, attacked Melvin\nMammah and bit off three of his fingers. In the chaos of the moment, the five\nmen fled on foot. Four escaped but the driver, Issa Kanu, ran towards a group\nof chimpanzees, which attacked and killed him before they melted into the\nforest.\n\n\u201cWhen the chimpanzees at Tacugama escaped and found themselves in unfamiliar\nterritory, approached by a strange human, they panicked,\u201d Glynn told me by\nemail when I asked how he handled such a tragic event in a children\u2019s story.\n\u201cThe visitors who arrived were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. In\nthe story I\u2019ve taken Bruno\u2019s point of view and done my best to present the\nincident this way: as a tragic accident.\u201d\n\nIshmael Kindama Dumbuya, environmental reporter at the Standard Times\nNewspaper told me that Bruno\u2019s escape captured the imagination of people\nacross Sierra Leone, despite his role in the loss of a man\u2019s life. \u201cHe was a\nfamous and loved animal,\u201d he said. \u201cBruno became the topic of the day.\u201d\n\nOf the chimpanzees that escaped, 27 soon returned but Bruno was among the four\nthat did not. \u201cI was heartbroken,\u201d writes Bala Amarasekaran in the Afterword\nto King Bruno. \u201cBut once again Bruno was showing us the way. Chimpanzees need\nmore than a sanctuary, they need to be protected in the wild, along with the\nforest they live in.\u201d\n\nProspects look gloomy for the wild chimps of Sierra Leone. In the early 1970s\nan estimated 20,000 of them lived there. Today there are only around 5,000.\nMore than 100 are in the sanctuary at Tacugama. A portion of the proceeds from\nsales of King Bruno will support the centre\u2019s work, which now includes visits\nto local schools and rural communities to raise awareness of the need to\nprotect chimpanzees and their habitat.\n\nBala Amarasekaran told me: \u201cI believe we have protected and continue to\nprotect hundreds of wild chimps by education, stopping the pet trade, banning\nall life exports, protecting habitats through law enforcement activities and\nworking with communities.\u201d\n\nAnd Bruno?\n\n\u201cI think he is alive,\u201d Amarasekaran told me by email. The sanctuary set camera\ntraps in the Western Area Forest Reserve and the photos seem to show Bruno in\nthe company of wild chimpanzees. \u201cIf he has integrated himself into a group of\nwild chimps, there is very little chance of him knocking on our doors. Besides\nseven years is a long time for him make up his mind to come home.\u201d\n\nMaybe that\u2019s the point. Maybe for Bruno \u2018home\u2019 now means a world without\nwalls.\n\nPicture credits: Paul Glynn/Tacugama\n\nRelated posts\n\n  * Q&A with Paul Glynn, author of King Bruno\n  * Borneo\u2019s eco-stranded apes with nowhere to call home\n  * What gorillas can teach children about being human\n\nIf you liked this post, please check out my book Ladders to Heaven (published\nin North America as Gods, Wasps and Stranglers).

Touches the heart.\n\nReply\n\n  2. wandile kallipa\n\nFebruary 5, 2013 at 8:50 pm\n\nI am an enviromental journalist working for channel Africa radio external\nservice of the SABC in Johannesburg. The story of Bruno touched me very much\nindeed. The way we humans treat our close relative as well as other species is\nunimaginable. one tries to imagine if it was the opposite would it be best for\nus. That is my question looking at the plight of other species.\n\nReply\n\n  3. Ivan Kakooza\n\nFebruary 12, 2013 at 7:12 am\n\nSad story for Issa indeed!! I do hope Bruno continues to survive in the wild\nand thank you for sharing this story with us.\n\nReply\n\n  4. pmglynn\n\nFebruary 24, 2013 at 6:07 pm\n\nFor anyone interested in learning more and supporting the sanctuary Bala\nfounded, you can buy King Bruno on http://www.amazon.co.uk or via\nhttp://www.kingbruno.com.

Skyler\n\nNovember 3, 2016 at 12:49 pm\n\nI hope they kill Bruno. You cannot justify what he did! Issa was a good man\nand friend and didn\u2019t deserve what happened to him.\n\nReply\n\n     * Rod\n\nApril 22, 2017 at 4:23 pm\n\nBruno didn\u2019t ask for this to happen to him either. His family was killed by\nhumans leaving him an orphan. It stands to reason that he would be fearful and\nviolent towards humans. I\u2019m sure Issa was a wonderful man and his death is a\ntragedy, but killing Bruno will not bring Issa back or make this tragedy any\nless painful for those involved.\n\nReply\n\n       * Skye\n\nApril 12, 2022 at 2:02 am\n\nMy comment is a reply to Rod: You make no sense, Bruno is a killer of humans\nand once he has tasted that kill he will continue like a serial killer and\nanyone who accidentally runs by him is doomed. Bruno is no hero and for the\nauthor to tell a tale by Brunos perception is only writing his human emotions\ninto the story, for the author does not know what\u2019s in the mind of a dangerous\nalpha chimpanzee.\n\n       * Rod\n\nApril 14, 2022 at 12:10 pm\n\nPeople like you believe that if an animal kills a human it should be put to\ndeath because humans are more important than an animal. I don\u2019t believe that.\nHuman beings are not the most important species on Earth! In fact, if human\nbeings went extinct, the rest of the world would thrive in our absence.\n\n       * Katya\n\nJanuary 10, 2023 at 5:53 am\n\nI agree 100%. Even though Issa won\u2019t come back, who\u2019s to say that Bruna won\u2019t\nkill another person? There\u2019s no reason for Bruna to fear humans since he\u2019s\nalready brutally killed one. Kind of weird for someone to think that Bruna is\nthis cute creature that should be allowed to hurt whoever he comes across.\n\n       * Rod\n\nJanuary 11, 2023 at 1:30 am\n\nI don\u2019t think the chimp is a cute cuddly animal! But......I do acknowledge the\nreason he is the way he is, is not his own making. Humans destroyed his family\nwhen he was young and he is terrified of humans. He is so terrified he will\nkill in defence of his own life. This much seems obvious to me but your\ncomment makes you sound young.\n\n     * Brenda C\n\nFebruary 23, 2018 at 5:19 am\n\nThus is nature and in the natural world, we are not by any means the top\npredator. RIP Issa\n\nReply\n\n       * Knarf Trakiul\n\nMay 25, 2020 at 1:48 am\n\nLook at the world. Yes we are.\n\n     * Emily Greene\n\nAugust 25, 2021 at 10:21 pm\n\nWell said Skylar. Any animal who kills a human deserves to be put to death.\nIgnore the animal lovers who will do anything to justify and downplay when\npeople who haven\u2019t harmed other animals and yet are victims of their\nunpredictable and savage behavior. In memory of all of the people who were\nkilled by animals.\n\nReply\n\n     * King bruno\n\nSeptember 20, 2023 at 10:57 am\n\nIssa was stupid. He should have driven away from chimps not back into them a\nwreck risking everyone\u2019s lives. Then ran off and left everyone. Seems like he\nwas the reason that the other men was left so vulnerable to begin with.\n\nReply\n\n  7.

MARTIN\n\nNovember 17, 2023 at 9:17 pm\n\nTHE DIVERSE OPINIONS EXPRESSED IN THIS DEBATE CONFIRM ONE THING WE HATE, LOVE\nAND FEAR CHIMPS BECAUSE THEY ARE SO LIKE US. THEY ARE VIOLENT, LOVING, CRUEL\nAND SMART IN EQUAL DOSES. JUST LIKE MAN, JUST NOT AS PLENTIFUL OR AS GLOBALLY\nDESTRUCTIVE. YOU ONLY HAVE TO LOOK AT RECENT EVENTS IN ISRAEL / PALESTINE TO\nREALISE HOW LIKE BRUNO AND CHIMPS IN GENERAL WE ARE.; ESPECIALLY WHEN EXPOSED\nTO VIOLENCE. TRAUMATISED AS YOUNGSTERS BY IT SO IT BECOMES \u2018NORMALISED\u2019.
