There has got to be a better way.\n\nThe idea is simple. Use an airship to float on the top of the airmosphere,\nthen the craft slowly accelerates using electric/chemical hybrid rocket\nengines over days until it reaches orbital velocity.\n\nThe details are complicated. For one, for an airship to fly at the edge of\nspace it will need to be big. I mean really big, over a mile long. It would\nalso need to be very light, a gossomer hypersonic airship. Such a vehicle is\nnot suited for flight in the lower atmopshere. This and other factors create\nthe need to a three stage approach.\n\nThe first stage is an airship that travels from the ground to 140,000 feet.\nThere it will dock with a waystation floating at the top of the atmosphere.\nCargo and crew then transfer to a large 'Orbital Airship' for the nine day\njourney to orbit.\n\nThis is an enormous undertaking. It requires developments in hypersonics,\nplasma rocket engines, active drag reduction and more. It needs a great deal\nof experience operating in the upper atmosphere. This is not idle speculation.\nWe are building the test vehicles, conducting the tests, flying development\nmission now.\n\nWe have conducted thousands of tests in the ATO program, both on the ground\nand at the edge of space.\n\nWe have build a series of large and small airships, one step at a time.\n\nOf course this whole thing is crazy. You can't possibly fly and airship to\nspace, can you? We are answering that question. It's been an over 40 year\nproject. We've had our share of successes and failures. While we are figuring\nit out I invite you for follow along on the journey. I can't promise success,\nbut it will be a heck of a ride.\n\nDark Sky Station\n\n### Back to the main page\n\nThis page was last edited on January 6, 2020 Email comments to\njpowell@jpaerospace.com Copyright\u00a9 2020 JP Aerospace.
