The final rule was\nannounced in January.\n\nThe H-1B program is intended to allow folks with specialized knowledge to work\nin the US. The visa is a gold ticket to America for foreigners: among other\nthings, it gives them a runway to apply for permanent residency, and greater\nfreedom, which in turn provides a pathway to citizenship.\n\nThe tech industry \u2013 which has come to rely on H-1B workers \u2013 welcomed the rule\nrevision, citing abuse of the application process.\n\nIntel, in comments filed with USCIS last November, argued that \"As is true for\nother employers, the misuse of the H-1B registration process has undermined\nIntel's ability to retain critical talent. Since implementation of the\nelectronic registration system, Intel's H-1B selection rates have steadily\nplummeted, hampering efforts to expand its semiconductor design and\nmanufacturing efforts in the United States. A system meant to help administer\nthe H-1B lottery process has instead become a source of frustration and\ndisappointment.\"\n\nThe changes may not be enough, however.\n\n\"I'd say it's insufficient,\" opined Robert Law, director of the Center For\nHomeland Security And Immigration at the America First Policy Institute, who\nserved as a senior policy advisor and chief of policy at USCIS during the\nTrump administration.\n\nLaw, in an interview with The Register, suggested policies adopted by the\nTrump administration that prioritized people by skill might have helped, but\nwere abandoned by the Biden administration. \"And really, I don't think the\nBiden administration has done anything in the H-1B space that puts integrity\ninto the system and accountability.\"\n\n> I don't think the Biden administration has done anything in the H-1B space\n> that puts integrity into the system and accountability\n\n\"The new rules are only intended to address one aspect of fraud, which is\nmultiple submissions by the same person,\" noted John Miano, a fellow with the\nconservative Center for Immigration Studies, who has testified before Congress\nabout foreign labor. \"But that isn't going to do very much at all. There's no\ntracking of people through the process. The reality is too many people benefit\nfrom the fraud so it goes on.\"\n\nAcross the political aisle, the progressive Economic Policy Institute (EPI)\nexpressed similar skepticism about the USCIS proposals.\n\nResponding to the NPRM's solicitation for comments, EPI declared: \"[T]he H-1B\nModernization rule only tinkers at the edges of improving program integrity,\nbut fails terribly to tackle any of the real problems that have been\ndocumented by investigative news reports, government audits, and researchers\nlike ourselves \u2013 while simultaneously proposing to dramatically expand the\nsize of an H-1B program that remains vulnerable to rampant fraud and abuse.\"\n\nThe H-1B program was created in 1990, and presently allocates 85,000 spots\nannually for temporary non-immigrant workers to come to the US \u2013 ostensibly to\nfill gaps in the American labor force. Counting other exemptions like those\nafforded academic institutions, the program awards about 130,000 visas per\nyear to foreign workers, and renews about 300,000 previously awarded visas \u2013\nwhich typically last for three years and can be extended for another three.\n\nThe process works as follows: Eligible H-1B applicants, or companies\nrepresenting them, register to enter the H-1B cap lottery. Some 20,000\nadvanced degree petitions and 65,000 general petitions get selected. For\nselected registrants, employers can submit H-1B petitions on behalf of\nprospective employees. USCIS then processes the selected petitions and those\napproved can then come and work in the US.\n\nPreviously, employers submitted completed H-1B petitions in March and USCIS\nconducted its H1-B cap lottery at the end of that month to determine which\npetitions would be processed for the 85,000 slots.\n\nThe new process is similar, but applicants must provide a valid passport or\ntravel document during electronic registration \u2013 under the new rules, a\nbeneficiary may not be registered under more than one travel document. Also,\nnow all employers and their would-be employees have to have a shared \"myUSCIS\norganizational account\" for the registration process. Once registration is\nconcluded, USCIS randomly selects 85,000 registrants from the pool and\nnotifies registering employers that they can file an H-1B petition on behalf\nof the selected employee.\n\nThe goal here is ideally to prevent employers from gaming the lottery system\nby submitting multiple registrations for a single beneficiary.\n\nAs we reported last year, demand for these visas far outstrips supply, with\n780,884 applications for FY 2024 (received between March 1, 2023, and March\n17). That's up from 483,927 for FY 2023. The FY 2025 lottery concluded on\nMarch 25, 2024, after being extended three days to make up for a system\noutage. The total number of applications has yet to be released \u2013 but as\nbefore, 85,000 H-1B visas are expected to be awarded.\n\n### Exploited\n\nThe H-1B program has been criticized for various reasons. EPI, for example,\nnotes that American employers do not have to recruit US residents before\nhiring foreign H-1B workers, that it's legal for US employers to underpay H-1B\nworkers, relatively speaking, and that H-1B workers are often exploited and\nlack job protection and mobility, among other issues.\n\nThen there's the fraud. \"For years, the H-1B program has been riddled with\nlarge-scale fraud yet the agency failed to take adequate fraud-prevention\nmeasures,\" the EPI argued. \"The integrity efforts proposed in the NPRM are\nwelcome, but even if fully implemented, would address only a fraction of the\nfraud.\"\n\n\"The system is entirely written to promote fraud,\" asserted the Center for\nImmigration Studies' Miano, noting that while the H-1B statute dictates\nworkers are supposed to be paid a prevailing wage for their role and industry,\nemployers get to determine that prevailing wage, and neither the US Department\nof Labor nor USCIS can really challenge the listed figure.\n\nOne form of H-1B fraud involves companies colluding to file multiple petitions\non behalf of the same foreign worker. This serves to give the IT consultancies\ninvolved in trying to bring this worker to the US a greater chance of having\ntheir applicant selected, and of collecting a commission. As above, that's\nsupposed to be more difficult under the new system.\n\nA 2017 report [PDF] from the DHS Office of the Inspector General noted that\nmany technology consulting firms submitted petitions for workers with the\nintent of contracting them out to a third party, and that \"in many cases, the\nprojects provided within the petition are non-existent.\"\n\n\"When I was at USCIS,\" explained Law, \"you would have registrations or\npetitions with very common names. The belief from some of the fraud folks was\nthat some of the common names were inserted in there and then these\nbusinesses, after they won the lottery, would then go out and actually find\nsomebody [with that name] as opposed to having a real candidate in place.\"\n\n### Indentured\n\nThe fraud extends beyond gaming the visa lottery.\n\nA source familiar with the Indian IT community in the US \u2013 who asked not to be\nidentified out of concern for retribution \u2013 described a culture of corruption\nthrough which technology consultancies, working with larger firms that turn a\nblind eye to abuse, exploit the lack of H-1B oversight for financial gain.\n\n\"It's not just that multiple visa applications are put in for one person to\nobtain a H-1B visa,\" our source explained. \"Once the visa is obtained, that\nstudent then works off the cost of that visa (illegal but more common than\nnot) \u2013 usually in a 70/30 split favoring the student at whatever tier they\nwere hired in at. The higher tier you get recruited at, the better off you are\nwith pay. They will also have indentured servant-like debt as the prize for\ngetting to America.\"\n\n> They will also have indentured servant-like debt as the prize for getting to\n> America\n\nForeign students studying in the US who didn't win the visa lottery may play a\nrole in further fraud. We're told some consultancies tap up foreigners to work\nfor clients illegally using the identities of legit citizens or green card\nholders.\n\n\"That's where the true scam is and the real money is at,\" our source\nexplained. \"These people, recent IT grads, will do almost anything to stay in\nthe US and work an IT job. The visa scam is small potatoes compared to what\nhappens to the losers.\n\n\"They are offered jobs paying fractions of a dollar, to live with six people\nin a one bedroom apartment to manage costs. These people number in the\nthousands each year, compounded over decades.\"\n\n\"Their job is to impersonate a green card holder or US citizen to receive 30\npercent of the pay,\" with 70 percent going to the people organizing the fraud,\nour source continued. \"Why? Because it\u2019s still more money than their family\nback home could dream about.\n\n\"The winner is the consultancy ... This scam is decades old and is becoming a\nmassive problem in the IT market. And quite frankly, it's a major national\nsecurity threat since it's a large exploitable population with access to\nsensitive American data.\"\n\nThese problems extend to other guest worker programs such as the Optional\nPractical Training (OPT) scheme, which allows foreign students to work in the\nUS for 36 months. In Senate budget committee testimony [PDF] last September,\nRonil Hira, an EPI researcher and associate professor in the department of\npolitical science at Howard University, described OPT as an unauthorized guest\nworker program that isn't policed because Homeland Security insists that it's\nmerely a training program.\n\n\"OPT workers directly compete with, and substitute for, US workers,\" argued\nHira. \"I know at least one worker who unwittingly trained his OPT replacement.\nWhen he filed formal complaints to ICE and the Department of Justice, the\nagencies told him tough luck.\"\n\n  * H-1B fraud consultancies grow, with application abuse openly discussed online\n  * Homeland Security will test out using genAI to train US immigration officers\n  * Supreme Court doesn't want to hear union's beef about STEM grad work visas\n  * Uncle Sam probes H-1B abuse surge: What do our vultures make of it?\n\nThen there's the fraud that happens after the visa selection process, in which\nIT consultancies for large clients create work for themselves, to boost\nbillable hours. For example, our source recounted an incident from years past\ninvolving an individual who worked for a healthcare firm under another green\ncard holder's name.\n\n\"Whenever he wanted overtime, he would just bring down the servers and cause a\nP0 [high-priority trouble ticket] to come through,\" we're told. \"You know, he\nand his team would get paid. And that meant that they would maybe get like 10\nto 12 hours of overtime, all the while knowing how to solve the problem. They\ncreated extra income for themselves.\"\n\nOur source opined that while IT outsourcing of this sort is supposed to reduce\ncosts, the consultancies providing these services are organized to do the\nopposite.\n\n\"They inflate the cost by doing these types of things, making things more\ndifficult than they need to be. And it's not like any one person is ever doing\nit. But it is a culture that is causing it. They're not trying to actually\nmake things easier, faster, more affordable, more reliable, and so on. They're\njust doing whatever will to cause enough roles to be created so the\nconsultancy is warranted.\"\n\n### Outsourcing\n\nDuring his testimony Hira described how the H-1B program evolved.\n\n\"More than twenty years ago, Cognizant, Infosys, and Tata Consultancy Services\n(TCS) pioneered the H-1B-outsourcing business model, which was so profitable\nit quickly came to dominate the IT services industry. They offer customers a\nway to cut costs by outsourcing their US IT work to a team of on-site (in the\nUS) and offshore workers.\"\n\nThe ratio of on-site to offshore workers, said Hira, was commonly 30/70,\nbecause a portion of jobs could not be shipped overseas.\n\n\"Rather than hire US workers to perform the onshore work, these firms hire\nlarge numbers of H-1B and L-1 visa workers to fill the jobs in America,\" Hira\nexplained to the Senate committee. \"Exploiting the visa programs enables them\nto drive revenue growth and increase firm profitability. Hiring visa workers\ninstead of US workers offers advantages. The H-1B guest workers are\ncontrollable, indentured, and are paid less than the US workers, and they\nfacilitate the transfer of work to offshore teams in India.\"\n\nUSCIS last year highlighted its \"extensive fraud investigations\" and\n\"referrals for criminal prosecution.\" Yet, a year later, it has added just two\norgs to its Willful Violator list: Bonzer, LLC and BER-IT, Inc. If there is a\nfraud crackdown underway, it's not particularly visible.\n\n> American workers are being sidelined, overlooked and their wages are being\n> suppressed\n\nLaw believes the primary concern is the impact the H-1B program has on the\neconomy.\n\n\"American workers are being sidelined, overlooked and their wages are being\nsuppressed because of H-1Bs,\" he argued. \"Whether it's IT outsourcing firms or\nmajor companies like Microsoft, IBM, Facebook, Apple, and so on, the way the\nlaw was drafted and is currently being applied, all of these companies are\nlegally allowed to pay less than market wages.\"\n\nIn 2021 rulemaking, the US Department of Labor estimated that employers were\nunderpaying H-1B workers to the tune of $15 billion per year.\n\nSince December, 2023, according to the Wall Street Journal, at least 22 former\nemployees of TCS, India's largest IT consultancy by revenue, have filed\ncomplaints with the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. They allege\nthe firm illegally discriminated against them based on race and age by firing\nthem and giving their jobs to lower paid Indian tech workers on temporary work\nvisas.\n\nThe EEOC investigation is ongoing, and may or may not result in a formal\ncomplaint, but TCS has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nWhile the US Justice Department has had some success going after visa fraud,\nit doesn't always prevail. In 2017, former TCS employee Anil Kini filed a\nwhistleblower lawsuit against TCS alleging the company \"violated the False\nClaims Act (FCA) by failing to obtain H-1B visas for, and pay the proper H-1B\nwage rate to, employees who were engaged in H-1B visa work, as well as\nretaliating against [him] for investigating the scheme.\"\n\nIn February the case, which had been taken over by US government prosecutors,\nwas dismissed because the judge determined TCS \"did not have an 'obligation'\nunder the FCA to pay its employees higher wages\" and because Kini's\ninvestigation was not a protected activity under the FCA. That decision has\nbeen appealed.\n\nLaw asserted that the biggest outrage is staffing companies, and pointed to\nDisney's replacement of US workers with H-1B workers several years ago.\n\n\"Many of these fired American tech workers are forced to sign various\nnondisclosure agreements or they can only get a severance package if they shut\nup, and things like that,\" he alleged. \"Pretty much the entire tech industry\nhas determined that H-1Bs are part of their business model.\"\n\nLaw doesn't expect the H-1B rule changes to have much impact on fraud.\n\n\"You're seeing a far more brazen attitude by those who have made it a business\nof their own to help people game the H-1B system,\" he lamented.\n\n\"The fact that a quick Google search can find you a chat room \u2013 or Discord\nserver or Reddit thread or whatever the case may be \u2013 about how to do things\nthat are not above board, the H-1B context just goes to show that there are\nnot currently really any repercussions for doing those things. So until the\nDepartment of Homeland Security, Department of Labor, [and other agencies\ninvolved in this] get serious about it, you're going to continue to see\n[fraud] happen on a very large scale.\" \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Employment\n  * Government\n  * H-1B\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Employment\n  * Government\n  * H-1B\n  * Security\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * 2FA\n  * Advanced persistent threat\n  * Application Delivery Controller\n  * Authentication\n  * BEC\n  * Black Hat\n  * BSides\n  * Bug Bounty\n  * Common Vulnerability Scoring System\n  * Cybercrime\n  * Cybersecurity\n  * Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\n  * Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act\n  * Data Breach\n  * Data Protection\n  * Data Theft\n  * DDoS\n  * DEF CON\n  * Digital certificate\n  * Employment Tribunal\n  * Encryption\n  * Exploit\n  * Federal government of the United States\n  * Firewall\n  * Freelancing\n  * Government of the United Kingdom\n  * Hacker\n  * Hacking\n  * Hacktivism\n  * Identity Theft\n  * Incident response\n  * Infosec\n  * Insider Trading\n  * Job cuts\n  * Kenna Security\n  * Layoff\n  * NCSAM\n  * NCSC\n  * Palo Alto Networks\n  * Password\n  * Phishing\n  * Quantum key distribution\n  * Ransomware\n  * Remote Access Trojan\n  * REvil\n  * RSA Conference\n  * Spamming\n  * Spyware\n  * Surveillance\n  * TLS\n  * Trade Union\n  * Trojan\n  * Trusted Platform Module\n  * Umbrella Firm\n  * Vulnerability\n  * Wannacry\n  * Working from Home\n  * Zero trust\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965\n  * Sector\n\n#### More about\n\n43 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Employment\n  * Government\n  * H-1B\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Employment\n  * Government\n  * H-1B\n  * Security\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * 2FA\n  * Advanced persistent threat\n  * Application Delivery Controller\n  * Authentication\n  * BEC\n  * Black Hat\n  * BSides\n  * Bug Bounty\n  * Common Vulnerability Scoring System\n  * Cybercrime\n  * Cybersecurity\n  * Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\n  * Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act\n  * Data Breach\n  * Data Protection\n  * Data Theft\n  * DDoS\n  * DEF CON\n  * Digital certificate\n  * Employment Tribunal\n  * Encryption\n  * Exploit\n  * Federal government of the United States\n  * Firewall\n  * Freelancing\n  * Government of the United Kingdom\n  * Hacker\n  * Hacking\n  * Hacktivism\n  * Identity Theft\n  * Incident response\n  * Infosec\n  * Insider Trading\n  * Job cuts\n  * Kenna Security\n  * Layoff\n  * NCSAM\n  * NCSC\n  * Palo Alto Networks\n  * Password\n  * Phishing\n  * Quantum key distribution\n  * Ransomware\n  * Remote Access Trojan\n  * REvil\n  * RSA Conference\n  * Spamming\n  * Spyware\n  * Surveillance\n  * TLS\n  * Trade Union\n  * Trojan\n  * Trusted Platform Module\n  * Umbrella Firm\n  * Vulnerability\n  * Wannacry\n  * Working from Home\n  * Zero trust\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965\n  * Sector\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### US government excoriates Microsoft for 'avoidable errors' but keeps\npaying for its products\n\nAnalysis In what other sphere does a bad supplier not feel pain for its\nfoulups?\n\nCyber-crime7 days | 19\n\n#### Rust developers at Google are twice as productive as C++ teams\n\nCode shines up nicely in production, says Chocolate Factory's Bergstrom\n\nDevops12 days | 132\n\n#### Microsoft slammed for lax security that led to China's cyber-raid on\nExchange Online\n\nCISA calls for 'fundamental, security-focused reforms' to happen ASAP,\ndelaying work on other software\n\nSecurity9 days | 37\n\n#### A different view from the edge\n\nHow Dell NativeEdge provides the single pane of glass which harmonizes your IT\nand OT perspective\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### Microsoft squashes SmartScreen security bypass bug exploited in the wild\n\nPatch Tuesday Plus: Adobe, SAP, Fortinet, VMware, Cisco issue pressing updates\n\nSecurity2 days | 11\n\n#### Feds probe alleged classified US govt data theft and leak\n\nUpdated State Dept keeps schtum 'for security reasons'\n\nSecurity8 days | 11\n\n#### French issue alerte rouge after local governments knocked offline by\ncyber attack\n\nEmbarrassing, as its officials are in the US to discuss Olympics cyber threats\n\nSecurity4 hrs | 3\n\n#### Feds finally decide to do something about years-old SS7 spy holes in\nphone networks\n\nAnd Diameter, too, for good measure\n\nNetworks9 days | 22\n\n#### Row breaks out over true severity of two DNSSEC flaws\n\nUpdated Some of us would be happy being rated 7.5 out of 10, just sayin'\n\nCSO17 days | 11\n\n#### Malicious xz backdoor reveals fragility of open source\n\nAnalysis This time, we got lucky.
