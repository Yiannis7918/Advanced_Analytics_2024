The response was\noverwhelming, and I was thrilled to see the positive impact SheetSavvy AI was\nhaving on users' workflows and productivity.\n\nI implemented a pricing model that offered value to users while ensuring the\nsustainability of the product. The initial traction and first sales were a\ngreat validation of the product and the problem it solves.\n\n#### The Journey:\n\nBuilding SheetSavvy AI has been an incredible journey filled with challenges\nand triumphs.
