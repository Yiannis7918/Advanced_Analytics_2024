He is in custody because of our\ncase. The cause of concern is he was allowed prescribed home cooked food\nbecause he claimed he has high diabetes. But he is having mangoes, sweets and\nsugar with with tea. This is a basis to create a ground for bail,\" Hossain\nsubmitted.\n\nHossain said that the details came to be known after the agency wrote to Tihar\njail and sought information about Kejriwal's diet and the medicines being\ntaken by him.\n\nAdvocate Vivek Jain, appearing for Kejriwal, objected to the submissions by ED\nand said that the investigating agency was making these allegations only for\nthe media.\n\nJain also said that he is withdrawing the present application and that he will\nfile a better one.\n\nKejriwal is currently lodged in Tihar jail in connection with the money\nlaundering probe related to Delhi excise policy case.\n\nHis lawyers had informed the Rouse Avenue Court that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)\nnational convenor's sugar levels had dropped to 46 and was continuously\nfluctuating.\n\nThe Court today sought a report from Tihar Jail about the diet chart of\nKejriwal.\n\nKejriwal was arrested on March 21 by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on\nallegations that he was the \"key conspirator\" in the money laundering case\nregistered in the matter.\n\nThe arrest took place hours after his plea for interim protection from arrest\nwas rejected by the Delhi High Court.\n\nOn March 22, Kejriwal was produced by the ED before judge Baweja, who\ninitially remanded the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader to ED custody till March\n28.\n\nOn March 28, Kejriwal's ED custody was extended further.\n\nFinally, on April 1, Kejriwal was remanded to judicial custody till today.\n\nEarlier, the Court had denied Kejriwal's plea to have five meetings with his\nlegal team in Tihar Jail instead of two meetings which he is allowed.\n\nWhen he was sent to judicial custody on April 1, the Court had allowed him to\ncarry books and have home-cooked meal along with certain other facilities.\n\nArvind Kejriwal\n\nEnforcement Directorate\n\nRouse Avenue Court\n\nTihar jail\n\nFollow Us\n\nSubscribe\n\n  * News\u2304\n\n    * Corporate & In-House News\n    * Litigation\n    * Law & Policy\n    * Law Schools\n    * Judges\n  * Interviews\u2304\n\n    * Corporate & In-House\n    * Litigation\n    * Law & Policy\n    * Law Schools\n  * Columns\u2304\n\n    * Corporate & In-House\n    * Law & Policy\n    * Litigation\n    * The Recruiters\n    * Working Title\n  * Others\u2304\n\n    * WhatsApp Updates\n    * News\n    * Columns\n    * Apprentice Lawyer\n    * Student Subscription\n  * Law Firms\u2304\n\n    * Viewpoint\n    * Dealstreet\n\n  * Terms Of Use\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Contact Us\n  * Careers\n  * Advertise with us\n  * About us\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2021 Bar and Bench.
