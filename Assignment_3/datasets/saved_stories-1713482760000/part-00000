This unit is also known by its unit symbol, the nat.\nOne nat is the information content of an event when the probability of that\nevent occurring is 1/e.\n\nOne nat is equal to 1/ln 2 shannons \u2248 1.44 Sh or, equivalently, 1/ln 10\nhartleys \u2248 0.434 Hart.^[1]\n\n## History[edit]\n\nBoulton and Wallace used the term nit in conjunction with minimum message\nlength,^[2] which was subsequently changed by the minimum description length\ncommunity to nat to avoid confusion with the nit used as a unit of\nluminance.^[3]\n\nAlan Turing used the natural ban.^[4]\n\n## Entropy[edit]\n\nShannon entropy (information entropy), being the expected value of the\ninformation of an event, is inherently a quantity of the same type and with a\nunit of information. The International System of Units, by assigning the same\nunit (joule per kelvin) both to heat capacity and to thermodynamic entropy\nimplicitly treats information entropy as a quantity of dimension one, with 1\nnat = 1.^[a] Systems of natural units that normalize the Boltzmann constant to\n1 are effectively measuring thermodynamic entropy with the nat as unit.\n\nWhen the shannon entropy is written using a natural logarithm,\n\nit is implicitly giving a number measured in nats.\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ This implicitly also makes the nat the coherent unit of information in the SI.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b \"IEC 80000-13:2008\".
