It would take effect 180 days after it's\nenacted, requiring anyone who creates or alters a training set not only to\nlist works referenced by the dataset, but also to provide a URL to the dataset\nwithin 30 days before the AI system is released to the public. That URL would\npresumably give creators a way to double-check if their materials have been\nused and seek any credit or compensation available before the AI tools are in\nuse.\n\nAll notices would be kept in a publicly available online database.\n\nSchiff described the act as championing \"innovation while safeguarding the\nrights and contributions of creators, ensuring they are aware when their work\ncontributes to AI training datasets.\"\n\n\"This is about respecting creativity in the age of AI and marrying\ntechnological progress with fairness,\" Schiff said.\n\nCurrently, creators who don't have access to training datasets rely on AI\nmodels' outputs to figure out if their copyrighted works may have been\nincluded in training various AI systems. The New York Times, for example,\nprompted ChatGPT to spit out excerpts of its articles, relying on a tactic to\nidentify training data by asking ChatGPT to produce lines from specific\narticles, which OpenAI has curiously described as \"hacking.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnder Schiff's law, The New York Times would need to consult the database to\nID all articles used to train ChatGPT or any other AI system.\n\nAny AI maker who violates the act would risk a \"civil penalty in an amount not\nless than $5,000,\" the proposed bill said.\n\nAt a hearing on artificial intelligence and intellectual property, Rep.\nDarrell Issa (R-Calif.)\u2014who chairs the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts,\nIntellectual Property, and the Internet\u2014told Schiff that his subcommittee\nwould consider the \"thoughtful\" bill.\n\nSchiff told the subcommittee that the bill is \"only a first step\" toward\n\"ensuring that at a minimum\" creators are \"aware of when their work\ncontributes to AI training datasets,\" saying that he would \"welcome the\nopportunity to work with members of the subcommittee\" on advancing the bill.\n\n\"The rapid development of generative AI technologies has outpaced existing\ncopyright laws, which has led to widespread use of creative content to train\ngenerative AI models without consent or compensation,\" Schiff warned at the\nhearing.\n\nIn Schiff's press release, Meredith Stiehm, president of the Writers Guild of\nAmerica West, joined leaders from other creative groups celebrating the bill\nas an \"important first step\" for rightsholders.\n\n\"Greater transparency and guardrails around AI are necessary to protect\nwriters and other creators\" and address \"the unprecedented and unauthorized\nuse of copyrighted materials to train generative AI systems,\" Stiehm said.\n\nUntil the thorniest AI copyright questions are settled, Ken Doroshow, a chief\nlegal officer for the Recording Industry Association of America, suggested\nthat Schiff's bill filled an important gap by introducing \"comprehensive and\ntransparent recordkeeping\" that would provide \"one of the most fundamental\nbuilding blocks of effective enforcement of creators\u2019 rights.\"\n\nA senior adviser for the Human Artistry Campaign, Moiya McTier, went further,\ncelebrating the bill as stopping AI companies from \"exploiting\" artists and\ncreators.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"AI companies should stop hiding the ball when they copy creative works into\nAI systems and embrace clear rules of the road for recordkeeping that create a\nlevel and transparent playing field for the development and licensing of\ngenuinely innovative applications and tools,\" McTier said.\n\n## AI copyright guidance coming soon\n\nWhile courts weigh copyright questions raised by artists, book authors, and\nnewspapers, the US Copyright Office announced in March that it would be\nissuing guidance later this year, but the office does not seem to be\nprioritizing questions on AI training.\n\nInstead, the Copyright Office will focus first on issuing guidance on\ndeepfakes and AI outputs. This spring, the office will release a report\n\"analyzing the impact of AI on copyright\" of \"digital replicas, or the use of\nAI to digitally replicate individuals\u2019 appearances, voices, or other aspects\nof their identities.\" Over the summer, another report will focus on \"the\ncopyrightability of works incorporating AI-generated material.\"\n\nRegarding \"the topic of training AI models on copyrighted works as well as any\nlicensing considerations and liability issues,\" the Copyright Office did not\nprovide a timeline for releasing guidance, only confirming that their \"goal is\nto finalize the entire report by the end of the fiscal year.\"\n\nOnce guidance is available, it could sway court opinions, although courts do\nnot necessarily have to apply Copyright Office guidance when weighing cases.\n\nThe Copyright Office's aspirational timeline does seem to be ahead of when at\nleast some courts can be expected to decide on some of the biggest copyright\nquestions for some creators. The class-action lawsuit raised by book authors\nagainst OpenAI, for example, is not expected to be resolved until February\n2025, and the New York Times' lawsuit is likely on a similar timeline.\nHowever, artists suing Stability AI face a hearing on that AI company's motion\nto dismiss this May.\n\n#### reader comments\n\n54\n\nAshley Belanger Ashley is a senior policy reporter for Ars Technica, dedicated\nto tracking social impacts of emerging policies and new technologies.
