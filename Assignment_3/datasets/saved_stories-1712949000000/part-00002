Hyde\n\nShare 6 books that shaped Japanese philosophy on Facebook\n\nShare 6 books that shaped Japanese philosophy on Twitter (X)\n\nShare 6 books that shaped Japanese philosophy on LinkedIn\n\nPicking a few books to characterize an entire intellectual tradition is tough.\nThat\u2019s because, in my view, history isn\u2019t driven by \u201cgreat men\u201d like the 19th-\ncentury historian Thomas Carlyle thought. On the contrary, history is the\nproduct of many social, economic, political, cultural, environmental, and\nmilitary forces, as well as completely arbitrary ones that defy\ncategorization. The same is true of intellectual history: At times, we can\nidentify certain works that have had a particularly great impact, like the\nBible in the West or the Confucian Analects in the East, but it would be silly\nto say that they wholly defined the intellectual history of a world region.\n\nThe other problem with identifying some books that shaped Japanese thought is\nthat we must first work out what shape Japanese thought has. Some think there\nis no such thing as Japanese philosophy, in part because lots of it was\nimported from China. In fact, at least three of the five books on Scotty\nHendricks\u2019 Big Think list of books that shaped Chinese thought could be\nincluded on my list as well.\n\nMany who think that there is such a thing as Japanese philosophy argue that\nwhat makes it distinctive is its syncretic character \u2014 i.e. opposing theories\nare combined rather than rejecting one for another. The books I have chosen as\nshaping Japanese thought are characteristic of this syncretism. They\u2019re also\nfoundational texts of different traditions within Japanese intellectual\nhistory, such as Buddhism and Bushid\u014d.\n\n## Prince Sh\u014dtoku\u2019s Seventeen-Article Constitution (604)\n\nRight from the outset, I\u2019m cheating a little in my choice of philosophy books\nbecause the Sh\u014dtoku Constitution isn\u2019t really a work of \u201cphilosophy.\u201d Nor, for\nthat matter, is it a \u201cconstitution\u201d either. As the 20th-century historian\nJames Murdoch described it in his history of Japan, it\u2019s \u201cnothing but a jumble\nof old and out-worn moral platitudes.\u201d\n\nThe reason I\u2019ve put it at the beginning of my list is the same reason why it\u2019s\nput at the beginning of the history of Japanese philosophy by intellectual\nhistorians like Thomas P. Kasulis, James W. Heisig, John C. Maraldo, H. Gene\nBlocker, and Christopher L. Starling: Not only is it the first written\ndocument in Japanese history, but it\u2019s also the first example of syncretism.\n\nThe Sh\u014dtoku Constitution was (allegedly) written at a time when Japan had just\ncome out of a civil war where the dispute was partly one between Buddhism and\nthe native animistic spirituality called Shint\u014d. Rather than siding with one\nof these religions, the Sh\u014dtoku Constitution combines both together, asserting\nthe importance of Buddhist religiosity and respect for Shint\u014d principles. It\nserves as the foundation for the syncretism of Shint\u014d and Buddhism (shinbutsu-\nsh\u016bg\u014d) that would come to be a core aspect of Japanese culture.\n\n## Kojiki (712) and Nihonshoki (720)\n\nAlthough two different texts, the Kojiki (Record of Ancient Matters)and\nNihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan) tell largely the same story. Both works of\nhistory, they begin with a story of the creation of the Japanese archipelago\ncalled the \u201cki-ki myth\u201d and go on to recount Japanese history from around the\n7th century BCE through to the 8th century ACE, becoming increasingly\nhistorically accurate (i.e. less pseudohistorical or mythical) in their\naccounts of later centuries.\n\nAt the time of their compilation in the 8th century, the texts didn\u2019t really\nhave much philosophical relevance, not least because they aren\u2019t supposed to\nbe works of philosophy (it\u2019s in the Nihonshoki, by the way, that the Sh\u014dtoku\nConstitution is recorded). A thousand years later, however, in the early 18th\ncentury, a movement called Native Studies gave the texts, particularly the ki-\nki myth, renewed importance \u2014 this time of a philosophical kind.\n\nWoodblock print of Emperor Jinmu, NihonShoki (Chronicles of Japan), by Ginko\nAdachi. Credit: Ginko Adachi (active 1874-1897) / Public domain / Wikimedia\nCommons\n\nScholars like Kada no Azumamaro, Kamo no Mabuchi, Motoori Norinaga, and Hirata\nAtsutane \u2014 the \u201cFour Great Men of Native Studies\u201d \u2014 reinvigorated the Kojiki\nand Nihonshoki. They believed that Japan had become too Chinese, and they\nabsolutely hated things Chinese. It was in these foundational texts that they\nfound the \u201cJapanese heart.\u201d\n\nThese texts took on another philosophical dimension in the late 19th and early\n20th centuries with the establishment of State Shint\u014d (spirituality turned\nideocracy in Imperial Japan) because it was the ki-ki myth that demonstrated\nthat the Japanese imperial household was descended from the gods \u2014 Amaterasu,\ngoddess of the sun, being the progenitrix of the imperial line. The ki-ki myth\nwas also cited as evidence of Japanese supremacy, until Japan\u2019s defeat in WWII\nwhen Emperor Hirohito was forced by the Allies to sign the Constitution of\nJapan, which asserted in its first article that the emperor\u2019s power comes not\nfrom his divine providence but \u201cfrom the will of the people with whom resides\nsovereign power.\u201d\n\n## K\u016bkai\u2019s Treatise on the Secret Mandala of the Ten States of Mind (830)\n\nAt the beginning of the 9th century, when the Buddhist Phase of Japanese\nintellectual history was just kicking off, two monks \u2014 Saich\u014d and K\u016bkai \u2014\nreturned from China, bringing back to Japan with them Tendai and Shingon\nBuddhism.\n\nBuddhism was not new to Japan. It had first arrived from Korea in the middle\nof the 6th century and had firmly taken root in Japan by the Nara Period\n(710-194) during which time Japanese Buddhism was characterized by the Six\nNara Schools, all of which had a base in the capital city of Nara, had close\nconnections with the aristocracy, and functioned somewhat like a religious,\nintellectual, and literary academy. It doesn\u2019t matter what those six schools\nwere; all that matters is that Shingon and Tendai weren\u2019t part of them \u2014 they\nwere intellectual outcasts.\n\nPart of the reason for this is that Shingon and Tendai had something in common\nthat massively distinguished them from the Six Nara Schools: they were both\nschools of esoteric Buddhism, whereas the established academy was entirely\nexoteric. The difference between them is mainly in the way that practitioners\naim to achieve enlightenment: exotericism tends to involve intellectual\nexercises like the study of literature; esotericism involves more \u2018spiritual\u2019\npractices like chanting mantras. In K\u016bkai\u2019s opinion, esotericism had much\ngreater access to truth and reality than exotericism.\n\nIn his Treatise on the Secret Mandala of the Ten States of Mind, he ranks ten\nmindsets that correspond to different philosophies, with Confucianism near the\nbottom, Buddhism further up, and esoteric Buddhism at the very top. Though\nK\u016bkai had placed his own school of Shingon Buddhism (unsurprisingly) at the\ntop of his list, it would ultimately prove a lot less successful than Saich\u014d\u2019s\nTendai sect which would dominate intellectual life, and even have enormous\nsway over politics, for centuries to come. Like Shingon, Tendai was esoteric\nand, thanks to its influence, Japanese Buddhism for the next thousand years\nwould be esoteric too.\n\n## Inazo Nitobe\u2019s Bushido: The Soul of Japan (1899)\n\nIt was in the Sengoku Period (1467-1615) that Bushid\u014d, or \u201cthe way of the\nwarrior,\u201d was systematized \u2014 though it\u2019s a point of contention to what extent\nit ever really was a proper system or code of thought, and historians like\nMichael Wert trace the kind of thought characteristic of Bushid\u014d back to at\nleast the Genpei War (1180-1185). Throughout the Tokugawa Period (1603-1868),\nmore foundational texts were produced, such as Miyamoto Musashi\u2019s Book of Five\nRings (1645) and Yamamoto Tsunetomo\u2019s Hagakure (1716), but it is widely agreed\nupon that it was Inazo Nitobe who formalized Bushid\u014d, what he called the \u201csoul\nof Japan\u201d \u2014 and in a book written in English no less (it was ten years before\nit was translated into Japanese)!\n\nFront cover of Bushido: The Soul of Japan (Philadelphia: Leeds & Biddle, 1900)\nby Inaz\u014d Nitobe (1862-1933). Credit: Houghton Library/ Public domain /\nWikimedia Commons\n\nNitobe associated Bushid\u014d with seven virtues: rectitude, courage, benevolence,\npoliteness, sincerity, honor, and loyalty. He compared it to Homeric values\nand medieval chivalry, which he considered European analogs of Bushid\u014d. The\nidea Nitobe had in mind was actually a complete myth and didn\u2019t represent the\nactual practices of premodern samurai, but it was his romanticized idea of\nBushid\u014d (sometimes called \u201cMeiji Bushid\u014d\u201d) that permeated Japanese society in\nthe 20th century and which came to be adopted by the Imperial Japanese Armed\nForces.\n\n## Nishida Kitar\u014d\u2019s Inquiry into the Good (1911)\n\n20th-century Japan was centered on what looked like one massive contradiction.\nOn the one hand, they were fiercely nationalistic, rejecting anything foreign.\nAt the same time, they sent their academics off to Europe to study with\nforeign academics and bring back to Japan with them modern European knowledge\nand technologies. Philosophy was one of the things that the Japanese brought\nback and seemingly accepted with open arms.\n\nIt was Nishida Kitar\u014d who fathered modern Japanese philosophy by Japanizing\nthis new intellectual import: A Zen Buddhist, he synthesized European\nphilosophy (particularly German idealism) with Zen. The chief result was the\nconcept of \u201cabsolute nothingness,\u201d and it was around this concept that the\nKyoto School \u2014 Japan\u2019s most prominent contribution to world philosophy \u2014 was\nformed.\n\nNishida (thanks to his Zen predilections) didn\u2019t like the dualisms of which\nthe world is full: hot and cold, left and right, up and down, me and you,\nexistence and non-existence. Like a true (Mahayana) Buddhist, he thought that\neverything is, at bottom, one. Absolute nothingness is that place before\nduality: it\u2019s the world as it really is, both existing and not existing,\nactual and potential. By thinking \u2014 that is, intellectualizing \u2014 we chop\nabsolute nothingness into bits and pieces to make the world dualistic, which\nis not how the world is. How to reach this state of absolute nothingness was\none of the principal questions around which modern Japanese philosophy was\norganized.\n\nTags\n\nClassic Literaturehistoryphilosophyreligion\n\nIn this article\n\nClassic Literaturehistoryphilosophyreligion\n\nRelated\n\nThinking\n\nIs there such a thing as \u201cJapanese philosophy\u201d?\n\nTraditionally, the long history of Japanese thought has not been viewed as\n\u201cphilosophy\u201d \u2014 even by Japanese scholars.
