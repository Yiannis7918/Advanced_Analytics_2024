These include the water cycle, carbon\ndioxide uptake by land and water, and rates of ice melt. Verifying and\nvalidating these equations are crucial for instilling confidence in climate\nmodels. Though some discrepancy between model predictions and actual\nobservations is inevitable, the aim is for specific configurations of the\nmodel to converge to the correct solution at the rate scientists expect.\n\nContinuous mathematical models must undergo a process called discretization,\nwhich converts them into forms that can be numerically solved by computers.\nTest cases can help with overall verification of a model by extracting subsets\nof the discretized equations and verifying each term. Measuring the rate at\nwhich the numerical solutions of these test cases converge toward the exact\nsolutions (meaning the errors approach zero) is the gold standard method for\nmodel verification. Convergence rates aligning with theoretical expectations\nis the best guarantee that the discretized equations are coded correctly.\n\nFor computational efficiency, ocean models typically split their governing\nequations into a 3D baroclinic component that models slow internal gravity\nwaves and ocean currents and a 2D barotropic component that models fast\nsurface gravity waves. The barotropic component assumes the form of shallow-\nwater equations. Bishnu et al. present a collection of test cases focused on\nthese equations.\n\nTo develop the test cases, the researchers drew on their experience developing\nthe Model for Prediction Across Scales\u2013Ocean (MPAS-Ocean), which is used to\nsimulate ocean activity and study how it is affected by anthropogenic climate\nchange. The authors note that their test cases are meant to verify the\naccuracy of the model (to ensure the discretized model equations are\nimplemented correctly), rather than to validate the results (to ensure the\nmodel predictions resemble real-world observations).\n\nThe researchers reviewed the theoretical foundations of the shallow-water\nequations alongside the discretization methods, offered an overview of the\ntest cases to ensure reproducibility, and demonstrated that the convergence\nrates match the anticipated predictions.\n\nThese test cases will enable other researchers to assess their models\u2019\ncomponents without the need for excessive computational power, the authors\nwrite. In addition, the test cases could be useful for broader fluid dynamics\nproblems and serve as instructional tools for studying and developing ocean\nmodels.
