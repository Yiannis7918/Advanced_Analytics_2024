It is a representation of the sun chariot, a bronze\nstatue of a horse and a large bronze disk, which are placed on a device with\nspoked wheels.\n\nThe sculpture was discovered with no accompanying objects in 1902 in a peat\nbog on the Trundholm moor in Odsherred in the northwestern part of Zealand,\n(approximately\n\nWikiMiniAtlas\n\n55\u00b055\u2032N 11\u00b037\u2032E / 55.917\u00b0N 11.617\u00b0E / 55.917; 11.617). It is now in the\ncollection of the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen.^[1] It is\nprominently featured on the 1000-krone banknote of the 2009 series.^[2]\n\n## Description[edit]\n\nThe gilded side of the Trundholm sun chariot\n\nThe horse stands on a bronze rod supported by four wheels. The rod below the\nhorse is connected to the disk, which is supported by two wheels. All of the\nwheels have four spokes. The artifact was cast in the lost wax method. The\nwhole object is approximately 54 cm \u00d7 35 cm \u00d7 29 cm (21 in \u00d7 14 in \u00d7 11 in) in\nsize (width, height, depth).^[3]^[1] Aspects of the decoration suggest a\nDanubian influence in the object, although it was produced locally.^[4]^[5]\n\nThe left side of the disk shows no traces of gildingGold disc detail\n\nThe disk has a diameter of approximately 25 cm (9.8 in). It is gilded on one\nside only, the right-hand side (when looking at the horse from behind). It\nconsists of two bronze disks that are joined by an outer bronze ring, with a\nthin sheet of gold applied to one face. The disks were then decorated with\npunches and gravers with zones of motifs of concentric circles, with bands of\nzig-zag decoration between borders. The gold side has an extra outer zone\nwhich may represent rays, and also a zone with concentric circles linked by\nlooping bands that \"instead of flowing in one direction, progress like the\nsteps of the dance, twice forward and once back\". The main features of the\nhorse are also highly decorated.^[6]\n\nThe two sides of the disk have been interpreted as an indication of a belief\nthat the Sun is drawn across the heavens from East to West during the day,\npresenting its bright side to the Earth and returns from West to East during\nthe night, when the dark side is being presented to the Earth. A continuation\naround a globe would have the same result. It is thought that the chariot was\npulled around during religious rituals to demonstrate the motion of the Sun in\nthe heavens.^[7]\n\nTwo similar discs have been found in Ireland: the Lattoon gold disc^[8]^[9]\nand the bronze Cooke disc, the latter dated to c. 1500\u2013 1300 BC. The Cooke\ndisc has similar fittings to the Trundholm chariot, suggesting that it was\nalso originally connected to a sun horse and mounted on wheels.^[10]\n\n## Date[edit]\n\nThe sculpture is dated to about 1400 BC,^[3] or Montellius period II (c.\n1500-1300 BC).^[11]\n\nEvidence for horse-drawn chariots first appears in Scandinavia around 1700 BC,\nin the form of petroglyphs, chariot bits and whip handles.^[12]^[13]^[14]\n\n## Calendar[edit]\n\nSome authors have suggested that the decoration on the disc numerically\nencodes a calendar, or calendrical information.^[15]^[16] The archaeologist\nChristoph Sommerfeld argues that both sides of the disc encode knowledge of\nthe 19-year lunisolar Metonic cycle.^[17] The Metonic cycle is also thought to\nbe encoded on the later Berlin Gold Hat, dating from c. 1000 BC.^[18]^[19]\n\n## Sun chariot in Indo-European mythology and religions[edit]\n\nMain article: Sun chariot\n\n### Norse mythology[edit]\n\nThe chariot has been interpreted as a possible Bronze Age predecessor to\nSkinfaxi,^[20] the horse that pulled Dagr, the personification of day, across\nthe sky.\n\n### Celtic Pantheon[edit]\n\nThe sky god Taranis is typically depicted with the attribute of a spoked\nwheel.\n\nSurya's chariot\n\n### Hindu scriptures[edit]\n\nMain article: Historical Vedic religion\n\nThe Rigveda in Hindu scriptures also reflects the mention of the Sun chariot.\nRV 10.85 mentions the sun god's bride as seated on a chariot pulled by two\nsteeds. The relevant verses are the following (trans. Griffith):\n\n> 10\\. Her spirit was the bridal car; the covering thereof was heaven: Bright\n> were both Steeds that drew it when Surya approached her husband's home. 11.\n> Thy Steeds were steady, kept in place by holy verse and Sama-hymn: All car\n> were thy two chariot wheels: thy path was tremulous in the sky, 12. Clean,\n> as thou wentest, were thy wheels, wind was the axle fastened there. Surya,\n> proceeding to her Lord, mounted a spirit-fashioned car.^[21]\n\n### Greek mythology[edit]\n\nIn Greek mythology, the solar deity Helios was said to wear a radiant crown as\nhis horse-drawn chariot raced across the sky, bringing daylight.^[22]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Egtved Girl\n  * Golden hat\n  * H\u00e5ga Kurgan\n  * Nebra skydisk\n  * Pha\u00ebton\n  * S\u00f3l (sun)\n  * Sun worship\n  * The King's Grave\n  * Urnfield culture\n  * Cult Wagon of Strettweg\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b \"Trundholm Sun Chariot\".
