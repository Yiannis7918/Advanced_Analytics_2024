Here is the first part of what will, with luck, be a\nthree-part series on \u201cprofessional writing.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m advised to add a disclaimer: that the following is derived from experience\nwith American and Americanized executives, and therefore may not be applicable\nbeyond that context.\n\nI spend a not-insubstantial amount of time writing for, and presenting to,\ncorporate and executive leadership. The principles underlying this type of\nwriting aren\u2019t complicated, mainly because executives are just people, albeit\npeople with far less patience and bandwidth than most, operating in a milieu\nthat has some fairly specific communication expectations.\n\nI\u2019m going to try to spell out some principles I\u2019ve absorbed about writing for\nexecutives. They\u2019re applicable across genres, formats, and contexts. These\nprinciples are useful even if you\u2019re not writing for executives\u2014because\nexpressing oneself clearly (and getting what one wants out of an interaction)\nare skills that can be applied everywhere in life, with anyone.\n\n  * Determine what you want\n\n  * Decide what you\u2019re saying\n\n  * Decide how you\u2019re saying what you\u2019re saying\n\n  * Lead with the point\n\n  * Situation, Complication, Resolution\n\n  * Rule of Three\n\n  * Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive (MECE)\n\n  * Tell AND Show\n\n  * Omit unnecessary words\n\n  * Don\u2019t over-framework\n\n  * Write the executive summary last\n\n####\n\nDetermine what you want\n\nYou are one of literally hundreds of people who want an executive\u2019s attention\nat any given minute of the business day. The best way to get what you want is\nto have some empathy and respect for your audience by using their time wisely.\nKnow what you want, and then ask for it, clearly and concisely.\n\nThe primary purpose of an executive is to make decisions. If you are\ninteracting with an executive, chances are you need to do one of three things:\ninform the executive of something, extract information from the executive, or\nget the executive to make a decision.\n\nWrite down what you want from the executive in a single sentence. If you\u2019re\ninforming the executive of something, also write down why that thing is\nhappening, and what you intend to do about that thing. If you\u2019re asking for\nsomething, also write down why you want it, why they should care, and what you\nintend to do with it. If you need a decision, articulate both the decision\nthat needs to be made, and why it needs to be made. Then, write down the\noutcome you want from your executive.\n\nNow, put all of the above aside. You will say (or write) none of the above to\nthe executive.\n\nInstead:\n\n####\n\nDecide what you\u2019re saying\n\nNow, write down what you will actually say to the executive. Be as concise as\nyou can. Bullet points are fine. Some people use the dotdash1 approach. Other\npeople \u201cwrite the headlines.\u201d Do what works for you.\n\nThen, whittle this down to the absolute shortest, most brief version of what\nyou want to say that still gets your point, and information, across. Remember:\nfor those with limited time, concision plus precision equals respect. Consider\nthat you are \u201coptimizing for time.\u201d\n\nEven better if you can make it three key points, as threes are deft way of\nstructuring writing (more on this shortly).\n\nThis does not have to be well written, or even cogent. Because next, you will:\n\n####\n\nDecide how you\u2019re saying what you\u2019re saying\n\nTo get what you want (or \u201cto have maximum impact\u201d), you need to consider a\ntricky, imprecise, yet critical dimension: how you position what you\u2019re\nsaying.\n\nA sidebar: it is a truth exhaustingly gestured-toward that, in corporate\ncontexts, one wants to make one\u2019s boss (or executive) look good. The inverse\nis also true: one does not want to make one\u2019s boss (or executive) look bad.\nAnother truth: what\u2019s appropriate communication between two colleagues is not\nappropriate communication in the boardroom. In the executive arena, new\ndynamics obtain: what is \u201cfrank\u201d or \u201cdirect\u201d or \u201creal\u201d can also, too easily,\nbe perceived as \u201cnegative\u201d or \u201cinflammatory\u201d or \u201calarming.\u201d What may be\ntolerated in good times as a \u201cidiosyncratic\u201d or \u201cunique\u201d or \u201crefreshing\u201d\ncommunication style can suddenly be perceived, in times of crisis, as\n\u201cunhelpful\u201d or \u201cuncooperative\u201d or \u201cradioactive.\u201d This is because a style that\nis overly direct can be conflated with accusation; that is, with placing undue\nexpectation and obligation on it\u2019s interlocutor. Managerial structures tend to\npush detail downward and reward timely resolution of difficulty by junior\nmanagers,2 and executives tend to dislike feeling blamed or complained-to by\nsomeone whose job it is to fix the problem.\n\nA further sidebar: rhetoric is the art of exerting an effect on an audience. I\nquote:3\n\n> Let it be said, first of all, that rhetoric is an inescapable activity in\n> our lives. Every day, we either use rhetoric or are exposed to it. Everyone\n> living in community with other people is inevitably a rhetorician. A parent\n> constantly uses rhetoric on a child; a teacher, on his or her students; a\n> salesperson, on customers; a supervisor, on workers. During every half hour\n> that we spend in front of a television set, we are subjected three or four\n> times to somebody's efforts to get us to buy something. During election\n> time, we are bombarded by candidates' appeals for our vote. Even when we are\n> driving on the streets and highways, our eyes are constantly assaulted by\n> sales pitches on huge billboards.\n\nOne may feel that, by paying so much attention to positioning, one is being\nscheming, calculating, even devious\u2014taking advantage of one\u2019s audience to\nhammer home one\u2019s particular view of the facts, to the detriment of the\nobjective \u201ctruth.\u201d One may calm down and rest in the reassurance that, by\ncarefully choosing one\u2019s words and framing, one is merely putting language to\nit\u2019s best, and arguably highest, purpose. If you truly have qualms about being\nperceived as manipulative, I say: grow up.\n\nBack to writing. Executives are sensitive: they appreciate precision, yet at\nthe same time are dowsing rods for bullshit. You need to be direct yet\ndiplomatic. Do not sugarcoat, but do not be unnecessarily negative either.\nExcess, of rhetoric or otherwise, can damage your credibility and diminish the\ntrust your executive has in you.\n\n    \n    \n    Draft: \u201cOur investors are skeptical and think we're idiots who don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n    \n    \n    Revision: \u201cOur investors are curious to learn more about our strategy and our implementation plans. Sharing more about our experience will help them understand our approach.\u201d\n\nYou may also discover a funny secret of extreme language: vehemence obscures\nimprecision.\n\n    \n    \n    Draft: \u201cOur customers hate our product.\u201d\n    \n    \n    Revision: \u201cOur customers don\u2019t complete transactions because of high site latency, return our product in an average of two days, and when asked do not refer us to others.\u201d\n\nTwo things. One, imprecision is lethal: push to know what you mean, and say it\nneatly. Two, rhetorically speaking, you want to reframe what you want to say\nto be, if not positive, then at least neutral. This is not \u201cdissembling\u201d or\n\u201cdisguising\u201d or \u201clying.\u201d Executives are not stupid: if you give them bad news,\nthey will see it is bad, no matter how diplomatically you deliver it. The art\nis in the \u201chow.\u201d If you deliver bad news histrionically, you are undermining\nyour credibility, creating distraction, and calling attention to yourself\nunnecessarily. By infusing emotional or hyperbolic language into these\ncontexts, you also risk being seen as manipulative. But, if you deliver bad\nnews precisely and neutrally, you are a professional.\n\nOne day I\u2019ll write a glossary. For now, here are a few repositioned favorites:\n\n    \n    \n    Negative / Positive Skeptical / Curious Problems / Challenges Defiant / Courageous Afraid / Thoughtful\n\nIn any kind of writing, structure is how you\u2019re built, style is how you sound,\nand composition is how you make it happen. Here are a few notes on structure:\n\n####\n\nLead with the point\n\nBegin with a cleaned up, brief statement of what you need.\n\n    \n    \n    We\u2019re here to talk about the quarterly results.\n    \n    \n    I\u2019d like to update you on our overall progress. Then, I\u2019d like to get your thoughts on two questions in our proposal.\n    \n    \n    I\u2019d like you to weigh in on both our strategic recommendation, and on a draft of the email to the CFO.\n\nUsing people\u2019s time wisely is a gesture of respect. Using as little of their\ntime as you need to get what you need is even better.\n\n####\n\nSituation, Complication, Resolution\n\nThis is an approach frequently used in consulting: state the situation, state\nthe complication, and state the resolution. The situation should be rooted in\nfacts and data, objective and ideally measurable. The complication describes\nthe problem or the reason for action. The resolution is the proposed solution.\nThis can be done in three sentences but it can also be done in one.\n\n    \n    \n    Airline ticket sales are down 31% over the last two quarters due to a spike in agoraphobia, likely resulting from the rise in ominous portents and the entry of Mars into retrograde at the start of Q1. We need to increase ticket sales to cover not only the loss of revenue from this period, but also to meet our annual targets. An atomic bomb set off in the upper atmosphere of Mars will redirect its orbit out of retrograde for the next 6,731 quarters, restoring ticket sales to baseline.\n    \n    \n    Our competitors are stealing market share, and our new product was late to launch, but our next product launch will recapture our market lead.\n\n####\n\nRule of Three\n\nThe Aristotelian rule is as appealing to the listener as it is to the memory.\nThree is few enough to easily track as an audience, with enough dimension to\ncover substantive detail while remaining plausible to remember. Never one,\nnever two, always three. (Well, sometimes two, if you know what you\u2019re doing).\n\n    \n    \n    This, that, the other thing.\n    \n    \n    Yours, mine, and ours.\n    \n    \n    Body, soul, and mind.\n\n####\n\nMutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive (MECE)\n\nAnother consulting tool, popularized by the consulting tools.4 Putting things\ninto categories is a quick way to make sense of a large set of information; to\nmake useful categories, one must ensure they are both mutually exclusive\n(i.e., that no one item can be in more than one category at a time) and\ncollectively exhaustive (i.e., they exhaust all of the possibilities in the\nset). Yes, this device oversimplifies and omits the very real ambiguities\ninherent in many information sets; as a director of mine would say, \u201cThat\u2019s\nwhat footnotes and the appendix are for.\u201d\n\n    \n    \n    Age brackets: 18-24, 25-36, 37-45, 46-55, 55+\n    \n    \n    Birthplace: New York City; Amsterdam; Moscow\n    \n    \n    Dice rolls: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n\n####\n\nTell AND Show\n\nTo be effective, you need to do both. The term \u201cshow, don\u2019t tell\u201d has\nproliferated widely as a blunt-force heuristic, but originates, allegedly,\nfrom a 1910 book by Arthur Edwin Krows,5 citing a playwright of his\nacquaintance:\n\n> On this day, he could talk of little else but a striking motto he had found,\n> and which he had placed on the wall above his desk. The magic line was\n> \u201cShow\u2014not tell.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve written number of scenes in which characters come in\n> and tell about what happened outside,\u201d he said; \u201cbut it\u2019s wrong. The\n> audience wants to see what\u2019s going on. It shouldn\u2019t have happened outside\n> but right on the stage where everybody could see it.\n\nLikewise, your executive needs to be shown; also, importantly, they need to be\ntold what to think about what they are shown. So, what better way to tell your\nexecutive than with a picture of data, trends, visualizations, or something\nelse that makes apparent what you are telling them; what better way to show\nthem than to strip away anything unnecessary, except for the point. I often\nrefer to these with affection as \u201cbrutalist charts.\u201d\n\nSome of the most effective investor relations presentations I\u2019ve seen include\nbar charts with no labels: only bars of a single color, with the exception of\na single brightly-colored bar labeled with the company\u2019s logo. Absurd and\noffensively imprecise, yet effective. I attempt to reproduce a similar effect:\n\nGoogle Ngram chart of \u201cshow do not tell\u201d; rise correlates to proliferation of\ncreative writing MFA programs across the United States; spike correlates to\niPhone Launch on January 9, 2007\n\nExecutives are a skeptical bunch. They like to see things for themselves. Show\nthem the \u201cdata,\u201d and then tell them a slightly pithier version of the\nconclusion they may be coming to as they see it.\n\n####\n\nOmit unnecessary words\n\nDon\u2019t use ten when you can use five. Or five, when three will do.\n\n####\n\nDon\u2019t over-framework\n\nIt\u2019s tempting. Frameworks make one feel smart: they make complicated\ninformation easy to understand, they slot ideas neatly into place and, in\ntemplatizing thinking, can seem to write themselves. The most any one\npresentation, or document, can stand is one. Sometimes two, if you space them\nout.\n\nThis goes for most devices, by the way\u2014metaphors, similes, or other stylistic\nflights, at least in a \u201ccorporate\u201d context.\n\n####\n\nWrite the executive summary last\n\nThe executive summary is a page, or a set of bullets, or a concise paragraph,\nsummarizing the material you are presenting. It will be the first part of your\ndocument, and often the only part of your document the executive will read.\n\nIt\u2019s best to write this once you\u2019ve finished everything else. The process of\nwriting the entire document (with \u201cwhat you want to say\u201d and \u201cwhat you need\u201d\nand \u201chow you want to say it\u201d in mind) will reveal to you what you are actually\nsaying.\n\nThis is part one of three. The next two installments will focus on composition\nand on style.\n\n1\n\nA dotdash is just an outline, formatted in bullet points. The main ideas or\nheadlines that drive your story are designated by \u201cdots.\u201d Supporting ideas,\nfacts, and data are indented, and designated by dashes. That\u2019s literally it.\n\n2\n\nWith deep affection to Jackall\u2019s Moral Mazes.\n\n3\n\nFrom Classical Rhetoric for the Modern Student, Third Edition\n\n4\n\nA note on consultants. They are indeed loathsome, with few redeeming\nqualities; however, the crisp communication patterns they practice as a\nfunction of synthesis and diligence, are one of the reasons behind their\nproliferation. The good ones, anyway.\n\n5\n\nPlaywriting for Profit\n\n### Subscribe to Autoscriptorium\n\nBy An Archivette \u00b7 Launched a year ago\n\nA work in progress\n\nShare this post\n\n#### How to Write for Executives, Part One\n\nanarchivette.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Archivette\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great writing\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
