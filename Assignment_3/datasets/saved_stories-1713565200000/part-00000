Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n# Exclusive: iPhone emulator Provenance following Delta onto the App Store,\nwith SEGA and PlayStation support in tow\n\nNews\n\nBy Daryl Baxter\n\npublished 7 hours ago\n\nGet ready for PlayStation and Saturn emulation.\n\n(Image credit: 8BitDo)\n\niMore can exclusively reveal that Provenance, a multi-system emulator, is in\nthe works for iPhone, following Apple\u2019s recent App Store rule change.\n\nIn an email, Joseph Mattiello, project lead of Provenance, told us his team\n\u201care working on a release,\u201d but stated \u201cI need to investigate these new rules\nbefore an App Store submission, and to improve some quality-of-life issues.\nAlso, I need to change some things to adhere to the App Store\u2019s rules, such as\nmentioning \u201cbeta\u201d.\u201d\n\nApple\u2019s rule change on April 5 means that retro gaming emulators can now be\nmade available on the App Store. These are apps that can behave like one or\nmore gaming systems \u2014 two great examples are Provenance and Delta, another\nmulti-system emulator created by Riley Testut, which was released on April 17.\nThis is, at the time of writing, the number one free app on the App Store\nworldwide charts.\n\nProvenance goes further than Testut\u2019s Delta emulator, at least for now. The\napp supports systems such as the Sony PlayStation, SEGA Saturn, Nintendo\nVirtual Boy, Nintendo Gamecube, and many more. The team has also confirmed\nthey\u2019re working on support for SEGA Dreamcast, Sony PlayStation 2, and others.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM imore\n\nUsers should be aware though, that downloading Sony, SEGA, and Nintendo titles\nfor emulation, even if you own the physical titles, is considered a breach of\ncopyright law, especially by Nintendo. For those who want to use Provenance\nand other emulators on an iPhone lawfully, there are free, independently\ndeveloped games available online. One such example is Unearthed, a Game Boy\ngame that you can get from Homebrew Hub.\n\nLike Delta, Mattiello\u2019s emulator also has a Patreon which includes an upcoming\nversion that features early support for Sony\u2019s PlayStation Portable and SEGA\nDreamcast. Mattiello wasn\u2019t clear on a date he\u2019s aiming for Provenance to be\nmade available on the App Store at the time of writing.\n\n## I\u2019ve used Provenance before, and it\u2019s fantastic \u2014 iMore\u2019s take\n\nHaving used Provenance on Apple\u2019s iPad Pro, I\u2019m happy to report that it\u2019s a\nfantastic experience, especially when paired with one of the best game\ncontrollers for iPhone.\n\n## Master your iPhone in minutes\n\niMore offers spot-on advice and guidance from our team of experts, with\ndecades of Apple device experience to lean on.

Just remember, most games you\nmight expect to play on an emulator are still protected by copyright laws,\nregardless of whether they\u2019re still available to buy or not. If you want to\nmake sure you\u2019re not breaking any laws, there are plenty of homebrew\nPlayStation 1 games you will be able to play on the app when it\u2019s eventually\nmade available.\n\nI had always hoped that the day would come when I\u2019d be able to download\nProvenance from the App Store. It looks like that hope is finally becoming a\nreality.\n\nWhile Mattiello has been developing Provenance since 2016, the emulator was\nfirst created by James Addyman in 2013. This was back when jailbreaking, a\nmethod of installing any app onto an iPhone, was the only way to load the\nemulator onto the handset. Apple\u2019s rule change now allows his emulator on the\nApp Store \u2014 and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing just how it will fare on my\niPhone 15 Pro Max, when it\u2019s released in the near future.\n\n### More from iMore\n\n  * How to play games on Delta for iPhone\n  * The creator of a PSP emulator has said it will come to iPhone but \u2018it all depends on how Apple interprets their own rules\u2019\n  * Delta iPhone emulator also works on Mac and Apple Vision Pro\n\nDaryl Baxter\n\nFeatures Editor\n\nDaryl is iMore's Features Editor, overseeing long-form and in-depth articles\nand op-eds.
