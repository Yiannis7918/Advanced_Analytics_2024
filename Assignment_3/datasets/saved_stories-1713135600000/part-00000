The consulting behemoth\u2019s\nfindings were consistent with those of its previous three diversity studies,\nin 2015, 2018, and 2020, each of which had been cited across industries and\ngovernment institutions as proof of the supposed financial benefits of race-\nand gender-conscious hiring policies. Now, a new paper raises questions about\nMcKinsey\u2019s methodology and suggests that its advertised findings may have\ngotten the causation backward: financial success may lead corporations to\nembrace diversity efforts, rather than the other way around.\n\nEarlier this week, journalist Christopher Brunet flagged a paper in the March\n2024 issue of Econ Journal Watch, a biannual publication edited by George\nMason economist Daniel Klein that publishes article-length responses to other\neconomists\u2019 errors. The paper, written by accounting professors Jeremiah\nGreen, of Texas A&M, and John R. M. Hand, of the University of North Carolina,\naddressed the first three of McKinsey\u2019s four-installment series of diversity\nstudies.\n\nGreen and Hand sought to test the replicability of McKinsey\u2019s findings. Could\nanother set of researchers, using the same data, come to the same conclusions?\nSince McKinsey refused to turn over its numbers, Green and Hand had to\nreverse-engineer the firm\u2019s 2015, 2018, and 2020 datasets. The results were\nstartling: Green and Hand couldn\u2019t replicate the results of McKinsey\u2019s first\nthree studies, which monitored the profitability and executive demographics of\nan undisclosed group of S&P 500 firms and claimed to have found a positive\ncorrelation between diverse leadership and firms\u2019 performance. \u201cWe do not find\na statistically significant positive correlation between McKinsey\u2019s measures\nof the racial/ethnic diversity of the executive teams of firms\u201d as measured in\nDecember 2019, Green and Hand reported, \u201cand either the likelihood of\nfinancial outperformance over 2015\u20132019 or financial outperformance per se\nover 2015\u20132019.\u201d\n\nGreen and Hand not only were unable to replicate the studies\u2019 findings; they\nalso found that each of the three studies had analyzed the data backward.\nInstead of looking at a firm\u2019s diversity policies in the years leading up to a\ngiven year\u2019s financial performance, McKinsey had reviewed each firm\u2019s\nfinancial performance in the four or five years leading up to the year in\nwhich its researchers snapshotted their executive demographics. In other\nwords, according to Green and Hand, the positive correlations that McKinsey\nresearchers observed may have reflected \u201cbetter firm financial performance\ncausing companies to diversify the racial/ethnic composition of their\nexecutives, not the reverse.\u201d\n\nWouldn\u2019t this methodological problem have been obvious to McKinsey\nresearchers? Apparently, it was. Buried in the firm\u2019s 2018 study, its\nresearchers concede the possibility that \u201cbetter financial outperformance\nenables companies to achieve greater levels of diversity\u201d\u2014in other words, that\nmore profitable firms may pursue diversity-hiring policies as a result of\ntheir profitability. McKinsey\u2019s public presentation of its results, however,\nhas not been so nuanced. As Green and Hand record, Dame Vivian Hunt, a\nMcKinsey managing partner and a coauthor on each of the firm\u2019s diversity\nstudies, claimed in 2018 that \u201cthe leading companies in our datasets are\npursuing diversity because it\u2019s a business imperative and driving real\nbusiness results\u201d (emphasis added).\n\nDespite these methodological concerns, major corporations and government\nentities have cited the McKinsey studies to justify antimeritocratic hiring\npractices. A series of posts from the think tank America2100 lists several\nentities, including Raytheon, JP Morgan, and even the U.S. Navy, that\nreferenced the studies in their DEI materials. Intel Corporation executive\nJackie Sturn, for example, cited McKinsey\u2019s research as evidence that\n\u201cdiversity is pivotal for long-term economic growth.\u201d\n\nThe hyping of these McKinsey studies reflects progressives\u2019 inability to\ngrapple with or even admit the existence of tradeoffs. They do not consider\ntheir preferred programs to be the best of a set of imperfect options; rather,\ntheir policies represent definitive advances that come with no corresponding\ndownsides. They don\u2019t see the debate over diversity-hiring programs, for\ninstance, as being between inclusion, on the one hand, and meritocracy, on the\nother. They think that firms can hire candidates at least partially for\nreasons having nothing to do with those candidates\u2019 qualifications and not\nsuffer any corresponding drag in performance. It can\u2019t be that diversity-\nhiring programs correct for past injustices and are worth their inherent\ncosts\u2014a straightforward and honest (if misguided) argument\u2014it has to be that\ndiversity programs actually make corporations richer.\n\nProgressive proponents of decarceration do the same thing. They may want to\nmake the normative case that America\u2019s legal system is wholly unjust and ought\ntotally to be torn down, but they feel compelled to make an instrumental case\nas well, one that denies the most obvious tradeoffs of their preferred\npolicy\u2014that it would free murderers and other dangerous criminals. So they\ninsist instead that arresting and incarcerating criminals actually \u201cmakes us\nless safe.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s entirely possible that McKinsey will address Green and Hand\u2019s\nmethodological objections and claim vindication for the firm\u2019s original\nfindings. It\u2019s also possible that Green and Hand\u2019s objections are sound, and\nthat McKinsey\u2019s studies are bunk. But if firms are hiring people for important\npositions at least partially based on irrelevant criteria like race and sex,\nit doesn\u2019t take a social scientist to deduce that some corresponding decline\nin performance will result. You don\u2019t need a multimillion-dollar study to tell\nyou what common sense makes obvious.\n\nJohn Hirschauer is an associate editor at City Journal.\n\nPhoto by PAU BARRENA/AFP via Getty Images\n\nDonate\n\nCity Journal is a publication of the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research\n(MI), a leading free-market think tank.
