If you're new here, don't worry;\nwe'll start from the basics. Web development involves three essential\nlanguages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\n\nHTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, forms the structure of a\nwebpage, defining elements like text, images, and links, similar to a\nblueprint for a building.\n\nCSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, adds style and design to your webpage, making\nit visually appealing and user-friendly.\n\nJavaScript adds functionality to your webpage, making it interactive and\nallowing users to engage with elements like forms and buttons.\n\n## Understanding Programming Languages\n\nIn web development, a programming language is a means for developers to\ncommunicate with computers. It's like a set of rules designed to interact with\ncomputers effectively.\n\nWhile there are numerous programming languages, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are\nfundamental for web development. Understanding their roles is crucial for\nnavigating the programming landscape.\n\n## Setting Up Your Workspace\n\nBefore diving into HTML, let's prepare your workspace for writing and\nexperimenting with code. All you need is a simple text editor like Notepad\n(Windows), TextEdit (macOS), or Visual Studio Code (available for multiple\nplatforms).\n\nIf you're new to Visual Studio Code, watch this video tutorial to get started:\n\nVideo tutorial on setting up Visual Studio Code for beginners.\n\n### For Smartphone Users:\n\n1\\. Download a code editor app like \"QuickEdit\" (Android) or \"Textastic Code\nEditor\" (iOS) from your app store.\n\n2\\. Create a new file within the app.\n\n3\\. Save the file with a .html extension (e.g., index.html).\n\n#### Regardless of your device:\n\n1\\. Start coding by typing or copying HTML examples into your file.\n\n2\\. View your webpage by opening the file in a web browser. On a computer,\nright-click the file and select 'Open with' or drag it into your browser. On a\nsmartphone, use the app's preview feature or open it in your mobile browser.\n\nAs you code and view your webpage, you'll see it come to life. This hands-on\napproach will reinforce your learning and give you a sense of accomplishment.\n\nSet up your coding environment, and in the next lesson, we'll start building\nour first webpage using HTML.\n\n## Interactive Example\n\nBelow is a simple HTML code example:\n\nThis is how you would write HTML code:\n\nThis is what it would look like in a browser:\n\n", "frontpage": false}
