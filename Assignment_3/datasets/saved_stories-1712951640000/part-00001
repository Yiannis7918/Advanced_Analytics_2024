(August\n2022)  \n---  \n  \n(Learn how and when to remove this template message)  \n  \nThe Pareto principle may apply to fundraising, i.e. 20% of the donors\ncontributing towards 80% of the total\n\nThe Pareto principle (also known as the 80/20 rule, the law of the vital few\nand the principle of factor sparsity^[1]^[2]) states that for many outcomes,\nroughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes (the \"vital few\").^[1]\n\nIn 1941, management consultant Joseph M. Juran developed the concept in the\ncontext of quality control and improvement after reading the works of Italian\nsociologist and economist Vilfredo Pareto, who wrote in 1906 about the 80/20\nconnection while teaching at the University of Lausanne.^[3] In his first\nwork, Cours d'\u00e9conomie politique, Pareto showed that approximately 80% of the\nland in the Kingdom of Italy was owned by 20% of the population. The Pareto\nprinciple is only tangentially related to the Pareto efficiency.\n\nMathematically, the 80/20 rule is roughly described by a power law\ndistribution (also known as a Pareto distribution) for a particular set of\nparameters. Many natural phenomena are distributed according to power law\nstatistics.^[4] It is an adage of business management that \"80% of sales come\nfrom 20% of clients.\"^[5]\n\n## History[edit]\n\nIn 1941, Joseph M. Juran, a Romanian-born American engineer, came across the\nwork of Italian polymath Vilfredo Pareto. Pareto noted that approximately 80%\nof Italy's land was owned by 20% of the population.^[6]^[4] Juran applied the\nobservation that 80% of an issue is caused by 20% of the causes to quality\nissues. Later during his career, Juran preferred to describe this as \"the\nvital few and the useful many\" to highlight that the contribution of the\nremaining 80% should not be discarded entirely.^[7]\n\n## Mathematical explanation[edit]\n\nThis section possibly contains original research. Please improve it by\nverifying the claims made and adding inline citations. Statements consisting\nonly of original research should be removed. (May 2020) (Learn how and when to\nremove this template message)  \n---  \n  \nThe demonstration of the Pareto principle is explained by a large proportion\nof process variation being associated with a small proportion of process\nvariables.^[2] This is a special case of the wider phenomenon of Pareto\ndistributions. If the Pareto index \u03b1, which is one of the parameters\ncharacterizing a Pareto distribution, is chosen as \u03b1 = log_45 \u2248 1.16, then one\nhas 80% of effects coming from 20% of causes.^[8]\n\nThe term 80/20 is only a shorthand for the general principle at work. In\nindividual cases, the distribution could be nearer to 90/10 or 70/30. There is\nalso no need for the two numbers to add up to the number 100, as they are\nmeasures of different things. The Pareto principle is an illustration of a\n\"power law\" relationship, which also occurs in phenomena such as bush fires\nand earthquakes.^[9] Because it is self-similar over a wide range of\nmagnitudes, it produces outcomes completely different from Normal or Gaussian\ndistribution phenomena. This fact explains the frequent breakdowns of\nsophisticated financial instruments, which are modeled on the assumption that\na Gaussian relationship is appropriate to something like stock price\nmovements.^[10]\n\n### Gini coefficient and Hoover index[edit]\n\nUsing the \"A:B\" notation (for example, 0.8:0.2) and with A + B = 1, inequality\nmeasures like the Gini index (G) and the Hoover index (H) can be computed. In\nthis case both are the same:\n\n## Analysis[edit]\n\nA Pareto analysis in a diagram showing which cause should be addressed first\n\nPareto analysis is a formal technique useful where many possible courses of\naction are competing for attention. In essence, the problem-solver estimates\nthe benefit delivered by each action, then selects a number of the most\neffective actions that deliver a total benefit reasonably close to the maximal\npossible one.\n\nPareto analysis is a creative way of looking at causes of problems because it\nhelps stimulate thinking and organize thoughts. However, it can be limited by\nits exclusion of possibly important problems which may be small initially, but\nwill grow with time. It should be combined with other analytical tools such as\nfailure mode and effects analysis and fault tree analysis for\nexample.^[citation needed]\n\nThis technique helps to identify the top portion of causes that need to be\naddressed to resolve the majority of problems. Once the predominant causes are\nidentified, then tools like the Ishikawa diagram or Fish-bone Analysis can be\nused to identify the root causes of the problems. While it is common to refer\nto pareto as \"80/20\" rule, under the assumption that, in all situations, 20%\nof causes determine 80% of problems, this ratio is merely a convenient rule of\nthumb and is not, nor should it be considered, an immutable law of nature.\n\nThe application of the Pareto analysis in risk management allows management to\nfocus on those risks that have the most impact on the project.^[11]\n\nSteps to identify the important causes using 80/20 rule:^[12]\n\n  1. Form a frequency of occurrences as a percentage\n  2. Arrange the rows in decreasing order of importance of the causes (i.e., the most important cause first)\n  3. Add a cumulative percentage column to the table, then plot the information\n  4. Plot (#1) a curve with causes on x- and cumulative percentage on y-axis\n  5. Plot (#2) a bar graph with causes on x- and percent frequency on y-axis\n  6. Draw a horizontal dotted line at 80% from the y-axis to intersect the curve. Then draw a vertical dotted line from the point of intersection to the x-axis. The vertical dotted line separates the important causes (on the left) and trivial causes (on the right)\n  7. Explicitly review the chart to ensure that causes for at least 80% of the problems are captured\n\n## Applications[edit]\n\n### Economics[edit]\n\nPareto's observation was in connection with population and wealth. Pareto\nnoticed that approximately 80% of Italy's land was owned by 20% of the\npopulation.^[6] He then carried out surveys on a variety of other countries\nand found to his surprise that a similar distribution applied.^[citation\nneeded]\n\nA chart that demonstrated the effect appeared in the 1992 United Nations\nDevelopment Program Report, which showed that the richest 20% of the world's\npopulation receives 82.7% of the world's income.^[13] However, among nations,\nthe Gini index shows that wealth distributions vary substantially around this\nnorm.^[14]\n\nDistribution of world GDP, 1989^[15]Quintile of population| Income  \n---|---  \nRichest 20%| 82.70%  \nSecond 20%| 11.75%  \nThird 20%| 2.30%  \nFourth 20%| 1.85%  \nPoorest 20%| 1.40%  \n  \nThe principle also holds within the tails of the distribution. The physicist\nVictor Yakovenko of the University of Maryland, College Park and AC Silva\nanalyzed income data from the US Internal Revenue Service from 1983 to 2001\nand found that the income distribution of the richest 1\u20133% of the population\nalso follows Pareto's principle.^[16]\n\nIn Talent: How to Identify Entrepreneurs, economist Tyler Cowen and\nentrepreneur Daniel Gross suggest that the Pareto Principle can be applied to\nthe role of the 20% most talented individuals in generating the majority of\neconomic growth.^[17] According to the New York Times in 1988, many video\nrental shops reported that 80% of revenue came from 20% of videotapes\n(although rarely rented classics such as Gone with the Wind must be stocked to\nappear to have a good selection).^[18]\n\n### Computing[edit]\n\nIn computer science the Pareto principle can be applied to optimization\nefforts.^[19] For example, Microsoft noted that by fixing the top 20% of the\nmost-reported bugs, 80% of the related errors and crashes in a given system\nwould be eliminated.^[20] Lowell Arthur expressed that \"20% of the code has\n80% of the errors. Find them, fix them!\"^[21] It was also discovered that, in\ngeneral, 80% of a piece of software can be written in 20% of the total\nallocated time. Conversely, the hardest 20% of the code takes 80% of the time.\nThis factor is usually a part of COCOMO estimating for software\ncoding.^[citation needed]\n\n### Occupational health and safety[edit]\n\nOccupational health and safety professionals use the Pareto principle to\nunderline the importance of hazard prioritization. Assuming 20% of the hazards\naccount for 80% of the injuries, and by categorizing hazards, safety\nprofessionals can target those 20% of the hazards that cause 80% of the\ninjuries or accidents. Alternatively, if hazards are addressed in random\norder, a safety professional is more likely to fix one of the 80% of hazards\nthat account only for some fraction of the remaining 20% of injuries.^[22]\n\nAside from ensuring efficient accident prevention practices, the Pareto\nprinciple also ensures hazards are addressed in an economical order, because\nthe technique ensures the utilized resources are best used to prevent the most\naccidents.^[23]\n\n### Engineering and quality control[edit]\n\nThe Pareto principle is the basis for the Pareto chart, one of the key tools\nused in total quality control and Six Sigma techniques. The Pareto principle\nserves as a baseline for ABC-analysis and XYZ-analysis, widely used in\nlogistics and procurement for the purpose of optimizing stock of goods, as\nwell as costs of keeping and replenishing that stock.^[24] In engineering\ncontrol theory, such as for electromechanical energy converters, the 80/20\nprinciple applies to optimization efforts.^[19]\n\nThe remarkable success of statistically based searches for root causes is\nbased upon a combination of an empirical principle and mathematical logic. The\nempirical principle is usually known as the Pareto principle.^[25] With regard\nto variation causality, this principle states that there is a non-random\ndistribution of the slopes of the numerous (theoretically infinite) terms in\nthe general equation.\n\nAll of the terms are independent of each other by definition. Interdependent\nfactors appear as multiplication terms. The Pareto principle states that the\neffect of the dominant term is very much greater than the second-largest\neffect term, which in turn is very much greater than the third, and so\non.^[26] There is no explanation for this phenomenon; that is why we refer to\nit as an empirical principle.\n\nThe mathematical logic is known as the square-root-of-the-sum-of-the-squares\naxiom. This states that the variation caused by the steepest slope must be\nsquared, and then the result added to the square of the variation caused by\nthe second-steepest slope, and so on. The total observed variation is then the\nsquare root of the total sum of the variation caused by individual slopes\nsquared. This derives from the probability density function for multiple\nvariables or the multivariate distribution (we are treating each term as an\nindependent variable).\n\nThe combination of the Pareto principle and the square-root-of-the-sum-of-the-\nsquares axiom means that the strongest term in the general equation totally\ndominates the observed variation of effect. Thus, the strongest term will\ndominate the data collected for hypothesis testing.\n\nIn the systems science discipline, Joshua M. Epstein and Robert Axtell created\nan agent-based simulation model called Sugarscape, from a decentralized\nmodeling approach, based on individual behavior rules defined for each agent\nin the economy. Wealth distribution and Pareto's 80/20 principle emerged in\ntheir results, which suggests the principle is a collective consequence of\nthese individual rules.^[27]\n\n### Health and social outcomes[edit]\n\nIn 2009, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality said 20% of patients\nincurred 80% of healthcare expenses due to chronic conditions.^[28] A 2021\nanalysis showed unequal distribution of healthcare costs, with older patients\nand those with poorer health incurring more costs.^[29] The 20/80 rule has\nbeen proposed as a rule of thumb for the infection distribution in\nsuperspreading events.^[30]^[31] However, the degree of infectiousness has\nbeen found to be distributed continuously in the population.^[31] In epidemics\nwith super-spreading, the majority of individuals infect relatively few\nsecondary contacts.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * 1% rule \u2013 Hypothesis that more people will lurk in a virtual community than will participate\n  * 10/90 gap \u2013 Health statistic\n  * Ninety\u2013ninety rule \u2013 Humorous aphorism in computer programming\n  * Sturgeon's law \u2013 \"Ninety percent of everything is crap\"\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b Bunkley, Nick (March 3, 2008). \"Joseph Juran, 103, Pioneer in Quality Control, Dies\".
