Here\u2019s How You Can, Too\n\nMarch 28, 2024 11:01 ET\n\nAll you need: your computer or smartphone, some free tools, and your child\u2019s\ninternet- or Bluetooth-connected toy By Ross Teixeira and Colin Lecher\n\nShirley Chong\n\n### Share This Article\n\nCopy Link Copied! Republish\n\nWelcome to The Markup, where we use investigative reporting, data analysis,\nand software engineering to challenge technology to serve the public good.\nSign up for Klaxon, a newsletter that delivers our stories and tools directly\nto your inbox.\n\nIt\u2019s a new era in entertainment for kids. Everywhere you look, new toys and\ndevices are marketed toward children with smart features. Gift guides and\nstore shelves tout Bluetooth- and Wi-Fi-enabled devices for kids, which\npromise an iPad-native generation a better way to play.\n\nBut are those toys secure? And precisely what data is being handed over when a\nkid is using these toys?\n\nThere are real reasons for concern: This year, the FTC hit Amazon with a $25\nmillion fine because Alexa devices were storing recordings and transcripts of\nchildren\u2019s voices, which the company retained even after parents requested\ndeletion of the data. It\u2019s just one of the many devices that could be\nrecording your children\u2019s speech or tracking their behavior.\n\nThe Markup is looking into what other toys collect private data on your\nchildren. The FBI recommends parents do their own research on digital toy\nprivacy but offers no advice on how to actually do so. We\u2019re here to help.\n\nThe BreakdownPrivacy\n\n### How to Quickly Get to the Important Truth Inside Any Privacy Policy\n\nAn investigative data journalist and a former tech lawyer teach you how to\nspot tricks and hidden disclosures within these interminable documents\u2014and\neven how to claw back some privacy\n\nAugust 3, 2023 08:00 ET\n\nThe first step is to read the privacy policy for a toy and, if applicable, its\ncompanion app. In particular, pay attention to what information is being\ntracked, how the info is used, and what partners that info is shared with. It\nmight also include a section about the toy company\u2019s compliance with the\n\u201cChildren\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act\u201d for protecting children under 13.\n\nThe next step is to figure out whether your device uses Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or\nboth; that information should be displayed on the toy\u2019s box or in the\ninstruction manual. A Wi-Fi-enabled toy will likely communicate with your\nwireless router to send data to the internet (though, in limited\ncircumstances, the toy may also communicate with other devices on the same Wi-\nFi network). Meanwhile, a Bluetooth toy will send data to another smart\ndevice, such as a smartphone, which may then relay that data to the internet\nusing Wi-Fi or cellular data.\n\nThen, grab your computer (and your smartphone if your toy uses Bluetooth). Our\ninstructions assume you\u2019re using macOS and iOS, though the tools below also\nhave Windows or Android (for HTTP Toolkit) alternatives. We have not tested\nthese instructions on Linux, but they should work there as well.\n\n\u21a9\ufe0e link\n\n## Bluetooth Toys\n\nIf your toy supports Bluetooth, it\u2019s likely that it needs to connect to a\nsmartphone app to function. For example, this \u201dEncanto\u201d karaoke machine uses\nthe \u201cEZ Link\u201d app on the iPhone or Android.\n\nTo capture traffic from a Bluetooth device, you will need to use a man-in-the-\nmiddle proxy that intercepts and monitors the network traffic between the\ndevice you want to monitor and the internet. We recommend using HTTP Toolkit,\nwhich has a nice interface and works on most operating systems.\n\nTo find out what your toy is up to, follow the steps below (modified from the\ninstructions here).\n\n  * Step 1: On your computer, download the HTTP Toolkit installer for macOS. When you open up the installer, you\u2019ll drag the app to your Applications folder (see below).\n\n  * Step 2: Ensure your smartphone and computer are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.\n  * Step 3: Find your computer\u2019s local network IP address by going to System Settings > Network > Wi-Fi. Then select the Details button (see below). Note the IP address listed there; you\u2019ll be entering it into your smartphone in Step 7.\n\n  1. Go to System Settings > Network > Wi-Fi. Then select the Details button, shown below.\n  2. Note the IP address, circled below.\n\nCredit:\n\n  * Step 4: Go to your Application folder and open HTTP Toolkit. If you have an Apple Silicon chip, your computer may ask you to install Rosetta, which is an Apple compatibility layer for older Intel software. Go ahead and click \u201cInstall.\u201d\n\nYou may get an alert that says, \u201c\u2018HTTP Toolkit\u2019 is an app downloaded from the\nInternet. Are you sure you want to open it?\u201d Yes, it\u2019s OK to open it.\n\n  * Step 5: Once HTTP Toolkit is open, you should automatically be on the Intercept HTTP page. Scroll down a bit and select the \u201cAnything\u201d box.\n  * Step 6: Now we\u2019ll configure our smartphone to use the proxy. Go to Settings > Wi-Fi. Then select the i icon next to the Wi-Fi network you\u2019re connected to. Scroll down the screen and select Configure Proxy. Select the Manual option.\n  * Step 7: Under \u201cServer,\u201d enter the IP address you saved from Step 3. Under \u201cPort,\u201d enter \u201c8000,\u201d which is HTTP Toolkit\u2019s default port setting (as long as you didn\u2019t change anything). You don\u2019t need to toggle \u201cAuthentication.\u201d Make sure you change your phone\u2019s proxy setting back to \u201cOff\u201d after you\u2019re finished monitoring your toy. Otherwise, you won\u2019t be able to connect to the internet. (We\u2019ll remind you again at the end of these steps.)\n  * Step 8: HTTP Toolkit shows data from every app on your phone all at once, so if you\u2019re running too many apps on your device, it may be difficult to see which traffic is coming from the toy. Before you go further, we recommend closing any apps by swiping up from the bottom edge of your phone and swiping up again on each open app.\n  * Step 9: Then, go to Settings > Battery and turn on Low Battery Mode, which pauses any apps from updating or sending traffic in the background. We\u2019ll remind you to turn Low Battery Mode back to \u201cOff\u201d after you\u2019re done monitoring your toy.\n\n## Report Deeply and Fix Things\n\nBecause it turns out moving fast and breaking things broke some super\nimportant things.\n\nGive Now\n\n  * Step 10: Finally, go to Settings > Privacy & Security. Turn off Tracking (the second option on the screen), then scroll to the bottom of the screen to find Analytics & Improvements and Apple Advertising. Turn those settings off as well. We recommend keeping these settings off after you\u2019re finished checking the toy.\n  * Step 11: Return to HTTP Toolkit on your computer, and download the root certificate by selecting \u201cExport CA certificate.\u201d Internet traffic is usually encrypted between your computer and the destination server, but the root certificate allows HTTP Toolkit to act as the \u201cdestination\u201d for your traffic and intercept it.\n  * Step 12: Email or AirDrop the certificate to your iPhone.\n\nIf using email, open with the built-in Mail app, which is the only iOS mail\napp that can open certificates. If using AirDrop, accept the request.\n\nIf you get a \u201cChoose a Device\u201d prompt, select \u201ciPhone.\u201d You should see a\n\u201cProfile Downloaded\u201d message on your phone after sending the certificate.\nClose this.\n\n  * Step 13: On your iPhone, go to Settings > General > VPN & Device Management. You should see \u201cHTTP Toolkit CA\u201d in the \u201cDownloaded profile\u201d section. Click on it, then click \u201cInstall\u201d in the top right corner. You may be prompted to enter your passcode. Click \u201cInstall\u201d again.\n\nThen, go to Settings > General > About > Certificate Trust Settings and enable\n\"Full Trust\" for the HTTP Toolkit certificate.\n\n  * Step 14: Head back to HTTP Toolkit on your computer and switch to the \u201cView\u201d tab on the left. You should see a bunch of text flying by on your screen. Each line of text is a piece of data that\u2019s being sent by your phone to the internet, including from iOS and any apps you have running on your phone that may be doing things in the background.\n  * Step 15: As a test, open an internet browser on your phone and navigate to any website (themarkup.org, for example).\n\nCaption: This is what appears in HTTP Toolkit when accessing themarkup.org in\nSafari on an iPhone.\n\n  * Step 16: If your window looks like this, congrats! Click on a line to get more details in the right window pane. For example, in the image above, the third line from the bottom shows that Safari downloaded an image from the Markup homepage.\n\nReminders: When you are finished monitoring your Bluetooth device, make sure\nyou return your computer and smartphone to its original settings:\n\n  * On your computer, quit HTTP Toolkit.\n  * On your phone, change the Wi-Fi proxy setting on your phone back to \u201cOff\u201d; otherwise, you will not be able to connect to the internet. Turn on \u201cWi-Fi assist\u201d if you prefer to keep it on. Then turn off \u201cLow Battery\u201d mode.\n  * To remove the root certificate from your phone, go to General > Settings > VPN & Device Management. Select \u201cHTTP Toolkit CA,\u201d then select \u201cRemove Profile.\u201d Select \u201cRemove\u201d when prompted.\n\nWe tested these instructions on the \u201cEncanto\u201d karaoke machine and monitored\nthe network traffic as we configured the toy using its EZ Link app. The app\nasked us to enter a birthday and choose which music streaming service we\nwanted to use. The app is very basic: When you push the big button on the\nfront of the karaoke machine, it sends a notification to your phone with a\nlink to the \u201cEncanto\u201d soundtrack on the streaming service you\u2019ve chosen.\n\nWe then tried all the features on the toy, including playing music, using the\nmicrophone, and recording to a USB drive. Overall, HTTP Toolkit finds ...\nnothing! It turns out this app is very secure and doesn\u2019t send any data. Nice\ngoing, eKids.\n\n\u21a9\ufe0e link\n\n## Wi-Fi Toys\n\nWi-Fi-enabled toys connect directly to your wireless network, so they require\na different method of tracking. There are expensive ways to track Wi-Fi toys,\nincluding buying a separate adapter, but we\u2019ll show you how to track these\ntoys for free using IoT Inspector, a research tool that allows you to monitor\nthe network traffic of IoT devices on your home Wi-Fi.\n\nPrivacy\n\n### Use Our Game Safety Buddy to Protect Your Kids and Yourself on Gaming\nConsoles\n\nOur tool and advice can help you navigate the overwhelming number of settings\non today\u2019s game platforms.\n\nFebruary 13, 2024 08:00 ET\n\nCaveat: IoT Inspector may have bugs. Running it might interfere with your\nnetwork, and, in the worst case, could require you to restart your router. Not\nevery toy is guaranteed to function correctly while IoT Inspector is running.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Do not run IoT Inspector on any network that you do not own. It is only\nsafe to run IoT Inspector on your home Wi-Fi.\n\n  * Step 1: Download and run IoT Inspector on your computer. If you are using Windows, you can download the zip file here, extract it, double-click \u201cIoT Inspector,\u201d and then skip to Step 7.\n  * Step 2: If you are on a Mac, open the Terminal app. It can be found by opening Finder, navigating to Applications > Utilities, and opening \u201cTerminal.\u201d\n  * Step 3: Install macOS\u2019s command line tools by copying xcode-select --install into the Terminal window, and press your \u21b5 Return (or \u21b5 Enter) key. This might take some time to install. If the tools are already installed, update your software in System Settings before continuing.\n  * Step 4: Next, we will download and configure IoT inspector. Copy and paste the following block of code into the Terminal and hit Return.\n\n\u21a9\ufe0e link\n\n    \n    \n    git clone https://github.com/nyu-mlab/iot-inspector-client.git cd iot-inspector-client python3 -m venv env source env/bin/activate pip install -r requirements-general.txt\n\n  * Step 5: Start IoT Inspector by pasting the following block of code into Terminal and hitting Return. Your Terminal may ask you for your password. If it does, type your computer account password into the Terminal\u2014it won\u2019t show you typing, but it works!\u2014and press Return.\n\n\u21a9\ufe0e link\n\n    \n    \n    source env/bin/activate cd ui ./start.bash\n\n  * Step 6: Copy the \u201cNetwork URL\u201d that appears in the Terminal, and paste it into your web browser.\n  * Step 7: Agree to the terms and warnings associated with running IoT Inspector. Optionally, you may consent to share your network data to the IoT Inspector research project at NYU. See the Privacy Policy for more info on the data it collects.\n  * Step 8: Once IoT Inspector is open, you will see a list of devices running on your home network. Each entry lists the device\u2019s local IP address (for internet connectivity) and MAC address (akin to a hardware serial number). For example, the second device in the image below has a local IP address of 192.168.12.164 and a MAC address ending in 9c:a4:1f.\n\nCaption: So many mysterious devices on the network!\n\n  * Step 9: IoT Inspector will try to identify the manufacturer of devices on your network. For example, the second device in the image above is guessed to be an Apple device. However, this guessing is not perfect. If you have never connected the toy to your home network, finding the toy is as simple as connecting the device and clicking the new device that appears at the bottom of the list. Otherwise, you will need to identify the toy by various means. The toy might display a MAC or local IP address in its settings or on a connected phone app that will help you identify the device. If not, try performing actions on the toy and see if one of the devices in IoT Inspector starts reporting more traffic.\n  * Step 10: Once you\u2019ve identified the toy, uncheck \u201cInspect\u201d for all other devices on the network so that you are only monitoring the toy you care about. When you click on the toy, you will see all traffic\u2014though unlike Bluetooth devices, IoT Inspector will only show you the domains being contacted, not exactly what data is being sent.\n\nReminders\n\n  * To quit IoT Inspector, click \u201cQuit IoT Inspector\u201d in the bottom left. If this does not work, go back to your Terminal and hit Command + Q or click \u201cTerminal\u201d in the top left of your screen and then \u201cQuit Terminal.\u201d\n  * When you are finished monitoring your toy, we recommend going to IoT Inspector\u2019s \u201cSettings\u201d and clicking \u201cReset IoT Inspector\u201d to clear the list of devices. Otherwise, you might see old devices in the list the next time you run IoT Inspector. If you opted into sharing your network data with NYU researchers, you may also delete your shared data here.\n\nRerunning IoT Inspector\n\n  * Step 1: To rerun IoT Inspector later, open Terminal and run the following lines of code:\n\n\u21a9\ufe0e link\n\n    \n    \n    cd iot-inspector-client python3 -m venv env source env/bin/activate cd ui ./start.bash\n\n  * Step 2: Then, go back to Step 6 and continue the instructions from there, skipping Step 7 since you\u2019ve already agreed to the terms and warnings.\n\nWith some toys, you may find that they are sending data to strange domains.\nTry to look for correlations between your actions and data. For example, if\nyou turn on a toy\u2019s camera and see large amounts of data being sent while the\ncamera is running, this suggests the toy is sending camera data. All of this\nanalysis should be combined with reading the toy\u2019s manual thoroughly and\nexperimenting with the toy\u2019s various actions to understand its full\ncapabilities.\n\nWe tried these instructions on a Tamagotchi Uni and found that the toy only\nsends data to aws.amazon.com. The Uni uses Amazon AWS to manage its online\nconnectivity. When starting up the Uni for the first time, the toy only asks\nfor a nickname and birthday. We could not confirm further what data is being\nsent to Amazon.\n\nTry these monitoring tools on your own toys and let us know if you find\nanything strange (or have any questions) at ross@themarkup.org.
