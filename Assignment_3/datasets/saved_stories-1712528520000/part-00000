It was proposed by Duncan J. Watts and Steven Strogatz in\ntheir article published in 1998 in the Nature scientific journal.^[1] The\nmodel also became known as the (Watts) beta model after Watts used to\nformulate it in his popular science book Six Degrees.\n\n## Rationale for the model[edit]\n\nThe formal study of random graphs dates back to the work of Paul Erd\u0151s and\nAlfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi.^[2] The graphs they considered, now known as the classical or\nErd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi (ER) graphs, offer a simple and powerful model with many\napplications.\n\nHowever the ER graphs do not have two important properties observed in many\nreal-world networks:\n\n  1. They do not generate local clustering and triadic closures. Instead, because they have a constant, random, and independent probability of two nodes being connected, ER graphs have a low clustering coefficient.\n  2. They do not account for the formation of hubs. Formally, the degree distribution of ER graphs converges to a Poisson distribution, rather than a power law observed in many real-world, scale-free networks.^[3]\n\nThe Watts and Strogatz model was designed as the simplest possible model that\naddresses the first of the two limitations. It accounts for clustering while\nretaining the short average path lengths of the ER model. It does so by\ninterpolating between a randomized structure close to ER graphs and a regular\nring lattice. Consequently, the model is able to at least partially explain\nthe \"small-world\" phenomena in a variety of networks, such as the power grid,\nneural network of C. elegans, networks of movie actors, or fat-metabolism\ncommunication in budding yeast.^[4]\n\n## Algorithm[edit]\n\nWatts\u2013Strogatz graph\n\nGiven the desired number of nodes , the mean degree (assumed to be an even\ninteger), and a parameter , all satisfying and , the model constructs an\nundirected graph with nodes and edges in the following way:\n\n  1. Construct a regular ring lattice, a graph with nodes each connected to neighbors, on each side. That is, if the nodes are labeled , there is an edge if and only if\n  2. For every node take every edge connecting to its rightmost neighbors, that is every edge such that , and rewire it with probability . Rewiring is done by replacing with where is chosen uniformly at random from all possible nodes while avoiding self-loops () and link duplication (there is no edge with at this point in the algorithm).\n\n## Properties[edit]\n\nThe underlying lattice structure of the model produces a locally clustered\nnetwork, while the randomly rewired links dramatically reduce the average path\nlengths. The algorithm introduces about of such non-lattice edges. Varying\nmakes it possible to interpolate between a regular lattice () and a structure\nclose to an Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi random graph with at . It does not approach the actual\nER model since every node will be connected to at least other nodes.\n\nThe three properties of interest are the average path length, the clustering\ncoefficient, and the degree distribution.\n\n### Average path length[edit]\n\nFor a ring lattice, the average path length^[1] is and scales linearly with\nthe system size. In the limiting case of , the graph approaches a random graph\nwith , while not actually converging to it. In the intermediate region , the\naverage path length falls very rapidly with increasing , quickly approaching\nits limiting value.\n\n### Clustering coefficient[edit]\n\nFor the ring lattice the clustering coefficient^[5] , and so tends to as\ngrows, independently of the system size.^[6] In the limiting case of the\nclustering coefficient is of the same order as the clustering coefficient for\nclassical random graphs, and is thus inversely proportional to the system\nsize. In the intermediate region the clustering coefficient remains quite\nclose to its value for the regular lattice, and only falls at relatively high\n. This results in a region where the average path length falls rapidly, but\nthe clustering coefficient does not, explaining the \"small-world\" phenomenon.\n\n    If we use the Barrat and Weigt^[6] measure for clustering defined as the fraction between the average number of edges between the neighbors of a node and the average number of possible edges between these neighbors, or, alternatively,\n\n    then we get\n\n### Degree distribution[edit]\n\nThe degree distribution in the case of the ring lattice is just a Dirac delta\nfunction centered at . The degree distribution for a large number of nodes and\ncan be written as,^[6]\n\nwhere is the number of edges that the node has or its degree. Here , and . The\nshape of the degree distribution is similar to that of a random graph and has\na pronounced peak at and decays exponentially for large . The topology of the\nnetwork is relatively homogeneous, meaning that all nodes are of similar\ndegree.\n\n## Limitations[edit]\n\nThe major limitation of the model is that it produces an unrealistic degree\ndistribution. In contrast, real networks are often scale-free networks\ninhomogeneous in degree, having hubs and a scale-free degree distribution.\nSuch networks are better described in that respect by the preferential\nattachment family of models, such as the Barab\u00e1si\u2013Albert (BA) model. (On the\nother hand, the Barab\u00e1si\u2013Albert model fails to produce the high levels of\nclustering seen in real networks, a shortcoming not shared by the Watts and\nStrogatz model. Thus, neither the Watts and Strogatz model nor the\nBarab\u00e1si\u2013Albert model should be viewed as fully realistic.)\n\nThe Watts and Strogatz model also implies a fixed number of nodes and thus\ncannot be used to model network growth.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Small-world networks\n  * Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi (ER) model\n  * Barab\u00e1si\u2013Albert model\n  * Social networks\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b Watts, D.
