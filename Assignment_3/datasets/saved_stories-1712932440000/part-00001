That page is solely about non-corporate tech blogs. So this post is\ntoo. I'll have to make another list for favorite corporate tech blogs.\n\nIn short, they:\n\n  * Tackle hard and confusing topics\n  * Show working code\n  * Make things simpler\n  * Write regularly\n  * Talk about tradeoffs and downsides\n  * Avoid internet slang, memes, swearing, sarcasm, and ranting\n\n### Tackle hard and confusing topics\n\nThere are a number of problems in programming and computer science where\notherwise knowledgeable programmers have to start mumbling about, or reverting\nto cliches or group-think, because they aren't sure.\n\nThese are the best topics you can possibly dive deep into. And my favorite\nwriters do exactly this.\n\nThey write about durability guarantees of disks and filesystems. They write\nabout common pitfalls in benchmarking. They write about database consistency\nanomalies. They write about threading and IO models.\n\nAnd they write about it by showing concrete examples and concrete logic so you\ncan learn how to stop handwaving on the topic.\n\nTheir writing helps you come out with a useful mental model you can apply to\nyour own problems.\n\nAnd you know, sometimes it's not about about the topic being obscure. Good\nwriters have the ability to tackle a boring topic in an interesting light.\nMaybe by digging deeper into a root cause. Or showing you the history behind\nthe scenes.\n\nMoreover, my favorite writers don't know everything. But they also don't\npretend to know everything. They're quick to admit they don't understand\nsomething and ask for help from their readers.\n\n### Show working code\n\nI love to see complete working code in a post. In contrast there are many\nprojects that start out simple and people write an article that covers the\nproject at a high level. But they keep working on the project and it becomes\nmore complex.\n\nIt's not always easy to follow commits over time.\n\nEli Bendersky and Serge Zaitsev are particularly great at developing small but\nmeaningful projects in a single post or short series.\n\n### Make things simpler\n\nOne of the marks of a good writer is that you can make complex topics simple.\nAnd not just by being reductive. Though sometimes even being reductive is\nuseful for education.\n\nIn contrast I sometimes see articles by less experienced writers and I marvel\nhow they make a simple topic so complex. I recognize this because I was\nabsolutely like that 10 years ago, if not 5 years ago.\n\n### Write regularly\n\nMy favorite blogs typically get a new post at least once a month. Some people,\nlike Murat, write once a week.\n\nI think the practice probably does improve your writing but mostly it's that\nthey keep my attention by publishing regularly!\n\n### Talk about tradeoffs and downsides\n\nNothing builds trust like talking about the issues with something you built.\nNo project is perfect. And to ignore the downsides risks seeming like you\ndon't know or understand them.\n\nSo the writers I like the most talk about decisions in context. They talk\nabout the good and the bad.\n\n### Avoid internet slang, memes, swearing, sarcasm, and ranting\n\nThere's no way I can think of talking about this without sounding super lame.\n\nOne thing I've noticed particularly among younger colleagues is the propensity\nto use memes or swear or use 4chan slang or use sarcasm. I also used to write\nlike this 10 years ago.\n\nThere is a chunk of your audience who won't care. The problem is that there's\nalso a chunk of your (potential) audience who definitely does care. There's\neven a chunk of your audience who may not care but just won't understand (i.e.\nnon-native English speakers).\n\nI have friends and folks I respect who write very well. But that also are also\noverly, unnecessarily edgy when they write. I don't like sharing these posts\nbecause I don't want to unnecessarily offend or turn off people either.\n\n### Closing thoughts\n\nIt would be boring if everyone wrote the same way. I'm glad the internet is\nstill fun and weird. But I wanted to share a few things that go into my\nfavorite technical blogs that I'm always happy to refer people to.\n\n> I wrote a short post on what I think makes a great technical\n> blog.https://t.co/QRFtQyQyU5 pic.twitter.com/QpsQC90EX5\n>\n> \u2014 Phil Eaton (@eatonphil) April 10, 2024\n\n#### Feedback\n\nAs always, please email or tweet me with questions, corrections, or ideas!\n\n#### Subscribe\n\nEnter your email if you'd like to be kept in the loop about future articles!\n\nYou can expect 2 to 4 messages per month depending on how motivated I'm\nfeeling. :)\n\nCheers, Phil\n\n### Thanks :)\n\nYou're in.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
