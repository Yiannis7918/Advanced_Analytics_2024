Pina focused on opening new pathways toward\ninnovating the universe of performing arts. When she staged her first pieces,\nthe audience was left surprised and puzzled. Many left the auditorium slamming\nthe doors shut. The choreographies were new, weird, and unappealing to some.\n\n## Pina Bausch\u2019s First Stage\n\nPina Bausch by Walter Vogel, 1966. Source: Pina Bausch Foundation\n\nBorn in 1940 in Solingen, Germany, Philippine Bausch was the daughter of\nAugust and Anita Bausch, who owned a small hotel with a restaurant in it. She\nand her siblings were always hanging around, helping their parents, and\ninteracting with customers. Her parents\u2019 workplace and its atmosphere\ncultivated Bausch\u2019s passion for dance, theater, and people. The hotel became\nthe first stage she performed on.\n\nBausch herself recalled how she used to hide under the tables and listen to\npeople\u2019s stories about many things\u2014happiness, grief, love, friendship,\nmelancholy, struggle, fear, desperation, hope, and light. This, along with the\nfact that she interacted with so many people and had the opportunity to\nobserve their personalities, shaped her own character. She remarked later in\nlife, \u201cI\u2019m not interested in how people move but what moves them.\u201d\n\nThe soon-to-be choreographer performed for the hotel\u2019s guests not only in the\nrestaurant but also in their rooms, trying to impress them with her talent.\nWhen Bausch was five, her parents took her to her first ballet class. Pina\nknew, from the very beginning, that there was something special about her.\nShortly after, she started performing on stage. She got small roles, of\ncourse, but they meant the world to her. That\u2019s when she realized that all she\nwanted to do in life was dance.\n\n## From Essen to New York\n\nPina Bausch by Walter Vogel, Year Unknown.

She was mentored by Kurt Jooss,\nwho aimed to combine the fundamental rules of ballet with the freedom of\nmovement and expression. Without a doubt, Kurt Jooss was one of the few people\nwho influenced and inspired Pina the most. At this school, Bausch also learned\nabout other forms of art, including music, drama, photography, and sculpture.\n\nAt 18, Bausch received a scholarship that gave her the opportunity to spend a\nyear in New York, studying at the famous Juilliard School. So she set off for\nAmerica to learn more. During her time in New York City, Pina was taught by\nAntony Tudor, the founder of the London Ballet and the Philadelphia Ballet\nGuild. Another notable teacher was Jos\u00e9 Lim\u00f3n, a dancer and choreographer who\nfounded the Jos\u00e9 Lim\u00f3n Dance Company and developed the Lim\u00f3n technique. Let\u2019s\nnot forget about Paul Taylor, the founder of the Paul Taylor Dance Company,\nwhom Bausch even performed with. All these people saw Pina for who she was\u2014a\nbrilliant, astounding dancer and choreographer.\n\nNot long after her arrival in New York City, Bausch was selected to perform at\nthe Metropolitan Opera Ballet Company with Antony Tudor himself. This was\nfollowed by multiple appearances on stage alongside other renowned dancers and\nchoreographers. Nonetheless, despite enjoying her time there, Bausch stayed in\nNew York for only two years, after which she returned to Essen to continue\nworking with Kurt Jooss.\n\n## A New Era: Tanztheater Wuppertal\n\nSweet Mambo by Pina Bausch, Oliver Look, Year Unknown. Credits: Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la\nVille, Paris\n\nSoon after returning to Essen, Bausch started choreographing her own pieces.\nThe first work she choreographed was called Fragment. The music was composed\nby B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k and the show premiered in 1967. Shortly after, she was\nappointed head of Jooss\u2019 Folkwang Tanzstudio. However, the true challenge\narose when Bausch was asked to become the artistic director of the Opernhaus\nWuppertal Ballet. This was not something she envisioned for herself, so she\nrefused. Luckily, Pina was pursued to take on the job. This marked a turning\npoint in both her life and the history of performing arts. The Opernhaus\nWuppertal Ballet was renamed to Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch.\n\nBefore working on the iconic pieces produced at Wuppertal, Bausch relied on\nthorough planning of every single detail. One day however, she decided to\ncompletely change her course of thinking and she gave up on planning anything.\nShe started going with the flow. Before her take-over, Wuppertal was known for\nshows featuring classical ballet. Pina, on the other hand, wanted to\nrevolutionize dance by combining multiple performing arts in a single piece.\nAt the same time, she wanted to express the feelings of a community and\nsimultaneously focus on a dancer\u2019s inner experiences.\n\n## Spectators Would Leave the Auditorium\n\nIphigenie auf Tauris by Pina Bausch, Ian Whalen, Year Unknown. Source:\nSemperoper, Dresden\n\nDuring rehearsals, Bausch used to ask her dancers questions. She asked what\nmoved them, what they yearned for, and how they felt once they lost something.\nShe also had other unconventional methods. For example, Pina once asked a\ndancer to express the moon through dance, while another was asked to show\nhappiness and joy. This way, Pina combined traditional choreographic\ntechniques with storytelling, drama, and the power of music.\n\nAs expected, the audience was outraged when Bausch\u2019s pieces premiered. They\nwere undoubtedly completely unconventional. People did not like them. It was\nnot easy to see feelings expressed so freely without a spoken word. Many\nvisitors left the auditorium. Others even made telephone calls to the\nrehearsal rooms to share their thoughts on the pieces. The newspaper reviews\nwere not great either. Not even the orchestra believed in what Pina was\nmaking, but she did not give her ideas up. Her goal was to challenge\nspectators and she did just that.\n\nThe Seven Deadly Sins by Pina Bausch, Photographer and Year Unknown. Source:\nTanztheater Wuppertal\n\nThis lasted for several years. The audience could not get used to the new way\nPina\u2019s artists performed on stage. Although it was a challenging period for\nher, Bausch continued working fervently, sketching thousands of her ideas,\ntrying to translate words and feelings into movement. Rolf B\u00f6rzik, the costume\nand set designer of many of Bausch\u2019s pieces who was also her husband, played a\nsignificant role in the process.\n\nHis inventiveness and out-of-the-box kind of thinking put Bausch\u2019s\nchoreographies into a new light. Together with B\u00f6rzik, Bausch combined her\nchoreographies with various natural elements, like fallen leaves, twigs,\nbranches, flowers, soil, coffee chairs and tables, animals, water, and stones.\nFor one piece, The Seven Deadly Sins, B\u00f6rzik and some stage technicians\nactually recreated a whole street on the stage. So, eventually, people started\nto understand her work better. They started hearing what Bausch was trying to\nsay.\n\n## Cafe M\u00fcller: A Choreography Performed With Eyes Closed\n\nCafe M\u00fcller by Pina Bausch, Photographer and Year Unknown. Source: Tanztheater\nWuppertal\n\nCafe M\u00fcller is by far the most renowned piece choreographed by Pina Bausch,\nnot only due to its iconic status in the history of 20th-century dance but\nalso due to Pina\u2019s presence in it. This is one of the few works she performed\nherself. The choreography was likely close to Bausch\u2019s heart since her\nchildhood served as inspiration for the piece. The stage for Cafe M\u00fcller was\nmade of randomly placed chairs in a room with three doors. The choreography\nrequired only six dancers\u2014three women and three men. Their costumes were\nhighly reminiscent of everyday clothes further enhancing the feeling of\neveryday life being.\n\nThe dancers performed repetitive movements with their eyes closed. Bausch\nherself stated that dancing in Cafe M\u00fcller with her eyes open would have\nchanged everything.\n\n## Male-Female Interactions in Pina\u2019s Choreographies\n\nThe Rite of Spring by Pina Bausch, Stephanie Berger, 2017. Source: Brooklyn\nAcademy of Music\n\nAnother Bausch choreography worth mentioning is The Rite of Spring by Igor\nStravinsky. It was performed on a stage covered in soil. The choreography\nrequired 32 dancers whose formations on the stage, along with the movements,\ncostumes, and facial expressions, combined perfectly to portray the tribal\ndynamics and the power of the sacrifice. In The Rite of Spring and other\npieces, the male-female interaction is omnipresent in Bausch\u2019s choreographies.\nThere\u2019s a focus on the imposed gender norms and invented concepts. For\nexample, Bausch hypersexualized women in her choreographies to satirize\nsociety\u2019s attitude toward them. Men, on the other hand, were often given\ncostumes that included dresses or heels that would further enhance the\nabsurdity of gender norms.\n\n## Vulnerabilities Shown As Strengths\n\nNelken by Pina Bausch, photographer and year unknown. Source: S\u00e3o Luiz Teatro\nMunicipal. Lisbon\n\nBausch\u2019s dancers remember her fondly. They considered her a mentor and an\nicon. Pina did not speak much. But when she did, she always said the right\nthings and she always asked the right things. Working with her meant digging\ninto one\u2019s memories and traumas. It also meant outlining a more clear idea of\none\u2019s dreams and goals. The dancers had to create gestures and use objects to\nexpress whatever they felt and found beneath the surface. This freedom equaled\nstrength and provided them with a safe space to explore their vulnerabilities.\n\nPina herself was always exposing herself on stage, if not physically, then\nemotionally. For instance, after B\u00f6rzik\u2019s death, Pina choreographed a piece\nnamed 1980 that unquestionably had touches of sadness to it. That same year,\nBausch met her future husband and the father of her child. After giving birth\nto Rolf Salomon Bausch in 1982, she choreographed Nelken, a highly\nrepresentative piece that required the stage to be filled with thousands of\ncarnations\u2014flowers given to mothers.\n\n## Pina Bausch\u2019s Legacy\n\nFull Moon by Pina Bausch, Vladimir Luvopskoy, 2022. Source: Impulstanz\n\nPina Bausch passed away in 2009 at the age of 68. That same year, she started\ncollaborating with Wim Wenders, a German filmmaker, in order to make a 3D\ndocumentary about her work. She died two days before the first day of the\nshooting. Wenders continued working on the documentary and the movie premiered\nin 2011 at the Berlin Film Festival. In 2009 and 2010, Bausch\u2019s work was\ncommemorated around the world through choreographies dedicated to her memory.\nHer pieces are still performed in different corners of the world.\n\nEven today\u2019s audience remains puzzled by her choreographies. They have been\ndescribed as dreamlike works that force the spectators to forget that they are\nlooking at a real stage. Pina Bausch is survived by her son Rolf Solomon\nBausch, but she is also survived by the many dancers that she mentored and the\nspectators that she moved. The effect Bausch had on people is undeniably\ntimeless.\n\n## READ NEXT:\n\nTamara Geva: A Pioneer in the World of Ballet\n\nShareTweetShareShareShare\n\nCopy\n\nEmail\n\nBy Mihaela GutuMA Literary Translations, BA EN/DE Language and\nLiteratureMihaela is a freelance writer, editor, and translator.
