The \u201cshit\u201d in\nquestion is platter after platter of shucked oysters, fat orange prawns, and\nlobsters smothered in garlic butter served up on beds of ice. \u201cPizza! We\u2019ll\nhave pizza,\u201d Logan commands. And so his staff carry away the dishes teeming\nwith crustaceans and unceremoniously dump them into the bins outside. The\nemergency pizzas are duly ordered and laid out on the dining table as the Roy\nfamily get down to business, but these too remain completely untouched.\n\nIn Succession, status is signalled by what characters eat \u2013 or don\u2019t eat. When\nCousin Greg brings along his arriviste date to Logan\u2019s birthday party \u2013 the\none with the \u201cludicrously capacious bag\u201d \u2013 Tom Wambsgans quips that she\u2019s\n\u201cwolfing all the canap\u00e9s like a famished warthog\u201d. Tom occasionally reveals\nhis own middle-class greed and snobbery through his irrepressible excitement\nabout fine food, as in the scene where he introduces Greg to the pleasures of\neating deep-fried ortolan. Later, when he\u2019s threatened with prison time, the\nfirst thing he frets about is the \u201cprison food\u201d and the logistics of making\n\u201ctoilet wine\u201d. By contrast, the Roys, the billionaires atop the Waystar Royco\nmedia empire, seem to barely eat or drink anything at all.\n\nRead More\n\nApril 2024 Horoscope: here\u2019s what the Solar Eclipse means for your sign\n\nRosacea can\u2019t be cured \u2013 but TikTok disagrees\n\n10 of the most erotic, explicit accounts on Instagram\n\nAre supplements a scam?\n\nSuccession is fiction, granted. But it remains an impressively accurate (and\nwell-researched) vignette of the lives of the mega-rich. Like the Roys, the\none per cent are increasingly styling themselves as having conquered and\nsubdued their appetites: X co-founder Jack Dorsey once admitted to fasting for\n22 hours a day, while multimillionaire biohacker Bryan Johnson has previously\nclaimed to do a 23-hour daily fast. Many other Silicon Valley workers swear by\nmeal replacement shakes like Soylent and Huel under the guise of \u201cbiohacking\u201d.\nBut extreme fasting isn\u2019t just confined to tech bros: Bella Hadid\u2019s morning\nroutine video featured over 20 different supplements and vitamins and just one\nbite of a sad-looking croissant.\n\nOf course, the most obvious example is Ozempic, the weight loss drug du jour\namong the elites, which works by suppressing hunger. Ozempic\u2019s impact has been\nso seismic that analysts have reckoned the drug could have an unprecedented\nimpact on food consumption. \u201cI obviously don\u2019t know when someone is taking\ndrugs,\u201d Anthony Geich, director of guest relations at Priyanka Chopra\u2019s haute\nIndian restaurant Sona, told The Cut back in 2023. \u201c[But] I\u2019ve definitely\nnoticed the trend of salads being ordered more, or people who are boxing their\nfood up at the end of the night.\u201d\n\nA person\u2019s relationship to food has always revealed a lot about their class.\nThe English king Henry I famously died after eating \u201ca surfeit of lampreys\u201d.\nIn the UK, the connotations carried by different foodstuffs have always been\n\u201cheavily dependent on scarcity,\u201d explains Pen Vogler, author of Stuffed: A\nHistory of Good Food and Hard Times in Britain. \u201cThe economists\u2019 old friend,\nthe supply and demand curve, is a fairly reliable indicator of what foods are\nused to signal high status: venison and game, the sale of which were highly\ncontrolled, from the Norman invasion onwards; spices in Medieval and Tudor\nEngland; French food in the 19th century,\u201d she says. \u201cFor centuries anything\nimported was high status \u2013 and we still grant \u2018middle class\u2019 to imported foods\nsuch as avocado or quinoa \u2013 even though they might be peasant foods in their\ncountries of origin.\u201d\n\nAs food choices are so closely linked to status, it follows that we also view\ncertain body types as more \u2018desirable\u2019 than others. \u201cFatness used to be a\nsymbol of wealth and lack of need \u2013 and therefore desirable \u2013 whereas thinness\nwas associated with poverty \u2013 and therefore undesirable,\u201d explains Dr Maxine\nWoolhouse, a senior lecturer in Psychology at Leeds Beckett University with\nexpertise in social class and eating practices. \u201cIn contemporary times, some\ntrends have flipped.\u201d Our work-centric society leaves little time for people \u2013\nparticularly people on low incomes \u2013 to plan, purchase and cook healthy food\nor exercise, and as Dr Woolhouse says, \u201cthis is a key reason why fatness is\nnow more associated with the working classes as opposed to thinness.\u201d\n\nToday, despite the \u2018body positivity\u2019 movement\u2019s best efforts, Western culture\ncontinues to valorise thinness. It's a trend which has had a devastating\nimpact on public health: in the UK, around 1.25 million people in the UK have\nan eating disorder and the number is rising sharply. Society has never prized\nthinness more, and yet it has never been so unattainable. \u201cWe are surrounded\nby so much food now, it is harder not to eat than to eat,\u201d Vogler explains.\n\u201cSo many things push food upon us: marketing, social media, TV advertising,\ndelivery apps, supermarket meal deals, cheap ultra-processed food which is\ndesigned to make us eat more.\u201d\n\nThings are very different for the elite. \u201cThe mega-rich don\u2019t have to eat\nobesogenic food,\u201d Vogler says. \u201cIt might be quite tough in our food and social\nmedia environment to be slim \u2013 and healthy too \u2013 but the mega-rich have the\nresources they need to do it: access to good fresh food, education, space,\ntime, social validation.\u201d It\u2019s also worth noting that Ozempic is still\nprimarily used by the wealthy, with reports claiming that users of the drug\nare concentrated in affluent areas like Manhattan and Hollywood. Elon Musk,\nthe third richest man alive, has also admitted to using the drug.\n\n> \u201cBeing able to demonstrate a lack of need for material goods, like food,\n> suggests social transcendence\u201d \u2013 Dr Maxine Woolhouse\n\nConsequently, hosting a lavish banquet or ordering lobster is no longer a\nsufficient signifier of status; today, a sign of true wealth is the ability to\nforgo food entirely. Eating essentially betrays a person\u2019s most basic human\nneeds; in an era obsessed with \u2018self-optimisation\u2019, not eating suggests that a\nperson is somehow \u2018beyond\u2019 needs and has achieved total mastery of their body\nwith a heightened capacity for efficiency and focus.\n\n\u201cThere is a history in Judeo-Christian societies \u2013 and likely in many other\nreligions, hence the widespread practice of fasting \u2013 where demonstrating a\nlack of need for material things, especially food, and being able to\ndemonstrate self-control and discipline are signs of spiritual transcendence,\u201d\nDr Woolhouse says. Famously, Italian saint Catherine of Siena would fast for\nprolonged periods of time as a means of demonstrating her devotion to God\nthrough extreme self-control. \u201cBut there\u2019s also a class dimension to this,\u201d Dr\nWoolhouse continues, \u201cbecause being able to demonstrate a lack of need for\nmaterial goods, like food, suggests social transcendence too; it\u2019s symbolic of\nliving a life whereby our material needs aren\u2019t a daily concern.\u201d She adds\nthat \u201cfad diets are very unlikely to take off in societies where there are\nfood shortages or food insecurity.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s still jarring to watch celebrities openly admit to fasting for 23 hours a\nday or taking 14 different supplement pills in lieu of a balanced breakfast.\n\u201cIt normalises and sanctions practises that in other contexts would be\nregarded as eating disordered,\u201d Dr Woolhouse says. \u201cWhen eating practices are\npackaged as \u2018done in the name of health\u2019, they are more socially acceptable\nand difficult to contest.\u201d She points out that a normal teenage girl\nrestricting her diet in the same way as Johnson would likely be regarded as\nill and in need of medical intervention. \u201cWhat we, as a society, regard as\n\u2018normal\u2019 and \u2018abnormal\u2019 eating is contextual and largely rides on how those\neating practices are framed.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s obvious but bears reiterating that extreme, fad diet trends are both\nineffectual and dangerous. But this trend isn\u2019t really about food or health.\nIt\u2019s about performance. It\u2019s a way for the moneyed classes to signal their\nwealth and status and posture as above us mere mortals who debase ourselves by\neating. Ultimately, though, there\u2019s no such thing as a jab or pill or meal\nreplacement shake that can totally eradicate the need to eat \u2013 so you might as\nwell enjoy it.\n\nBeautyFeaturefoodOzempiceating disorderssupplements\n\n#### Download the app \ud83d\udcf1\n\n  * Build your network and meet other creatives\n  * Be the first to hear about exclusive Dazed events and offers\n  * Share your work with our community\n\nJoin Dazed Club\n\nRead Next\n\nBeauty FeatureMenstrual magick: how to use your period blood for spells\n\nBeauty FeatureWhy are early YouTube beauty videos so comforting?\n\nBeauty FeatureA$AP Rocky: \u2018Home is anywhere that I have my lady and my\nchildren\u2019\n\nFashionMichael Kors\u2019 Colby is the only bag you need this springMichael Kors\n\n", "frontpage": false}
