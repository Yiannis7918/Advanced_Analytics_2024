Mentorship, coaching, and sponsorship are import tools in the staff\ndevelopment toolbox. Good leaders should be adept in all three, and know when\n(and when not) to use each. In my work with new managers, I sometimes see\nconfusion about these three different tools, and I see people using them in\nthe wrong circumstances.\n\nSo here\u2019s a glossary, a high-level explanation of what these three things are,\nhow they differ, and where to use them. Here\u2019s the very short version, and the\nslightly-longer version follows:\n\nMentorship| Coaching| Sponsorship  \n---|---|---  \nGoal| Knowledge transfer| Help the coachee achieve their goals| Career\nadvancement  \nFocus| Career progression, skill development| Goal attainment, skill\napplication| Unlocking organizational opportunities  \nModality| Hands-on guidance, sharing experience| Inquisitive, supportive\nquestioning and suggestions| Advocating for a sponsee - managing up or\nsideways  \nWhat it sounds like| \u201cI think you should...\u201d| \u201cWhat\u2019s your next step?\u201d|\n\u201cJasmine would be great at this\u201d  \nRelationship| Long-term, often outside of management chain| Short- or long-\nterm, inside or outside management chain or organization| Usually within\ncommand chain  \nExpertise| Mentor is usually more experienced| Coach may not be more skilled|\nSponsor has organizational influence  \n  \n## Mentorship\n\nMentorship is essentially passing on experience: a mentor has experience\nrelevant to what their mentee is working on, and is helping the mentee by\npassing on that knowledge. Mentors are almost always more senior than the\nmentee, at least in the specific domain involving mentorship.\n\nMentorship sounds like: \u201cI\u2019ve done this sort of thing before, and what I did\nwas ... I think you should ...\u201d.\n\nThe modality of mentorship is usually hands-on guidance: \u201cdo it like this\u201d.\nLike all good teaching there of course needs to be a balance of explicit\ndirection and letting students work through problems, but mentorship tends to\nmore often shift towards the explicitly didactic.\n\nMentorship is usually fairly broad, focused on career progression or\ndevelopment of a large swath of skills. So I might mentor someone trying to\nswitch careers from finance to software development, or a new manager looking\nto develop and eventually move up to Director, etc. Mentoring relationships\nare usually long-term, broad, and ongoing.\n\nMentorship tends to work best outside of the chain of command: peer\nmentorship, mentors from other teams, other companies, etc. The manager/report\nrelationship is quite different from a mentorship relationship, to the point\nthat it\u2019s usually ineffective for managers to mentor their reports. (Not\nalways, I\u2019ve seen it work \u2013 particularly in cases where the mentorship topic\ninvolves management \u2013 but it is unusual.)\n\n## Coaching\n\nCoaching is a process of helping someone achieve their goals. It can seem\nsimilar to mentorship (and they sometimes overlap), but the intent is quite\ndifferent. Mentorship is about knowledge transfer, but coaching is about\nachieving goals. Coaching may involve skill development sometimes, but often\ncoaching is more about helping someone figure out the best way to apply the\nskills they already have.\n\nCoaching sounds like: \u201cWhat are you trying to accomplish? What\u2019s standing in\nyour way? Have you tried ...? How\u2019d it go? What do you think you\u2019ll try\ndifferently next time? What are your next steps? Where do you want to be by\nnext week?\u201d\n\nThe modality of coaching is inquisitive, asking lots of questions. Coaches\ndon\u2019t typically provide answers; the best coaches help their clients come up\nwith the answers themselves. Coaches do make suggestions, and some coaches are\nmore proscriptive than others, but fundamentally coaching is supportive, not\ndirective.\n\nCoaches also help by providing external accountability. I work with a running\ncoach, and there are days when the only thing that gets me out of the door is\nknowing that if I don\u2019t I\u2019ll have to tell Joe I skipped a workout. It\u2019s not\nlike there are tangible consequences \u2014 coaches aren\u2019t bosses \u2014 but for me, and\nfor many people, the light pressure of feeling accountable to your coach can\nhelp overcome inertia. And, because ultimately a coach is helping you active\nyour goals, the knowledge that some activity is directly tied to that goal\nadds an additional bit of pressure to do the thing.\n\nCoaches are sometimes experts in the domain they\u2019re coaching, but not always.\nThey do need to have some knowledge, enough to observe and provide credible\nfeedback, but it\u2019s not uncommon for a coach to be less skilled than the person\nthey\u2019re coaching. Coaches for sports teams are an obvious example of this.\nSteve Kerr even in his prime wasn\u2019t as good a basketball player as Steph\nCurry, but he\u2019s a terrifically effective coach^1.\n\nCoaching works both within and outside the chain of command, and coaches can\nbe internal or external to your company. I\u2019ve frequently reached for coaches\noutside my company when I need support in some area that nobody at my\norganization can provide. Coaching methods differ a bit when you\u2019re coaching\nsomeone within your chain of command \u2013 for one, the power differential makes\nis harder to give suggestions that are truly heard as suggestions and not\norders \u2013 but these are subtle differences and beyond the scope of this\noverview.\n\n## Sponsorship\n\nUnlike mentorship and coaching, sponsorship isn\u2019t about helping someone learn\nor level up. The person already has the skills, and you are advocating for\ntheir career advancement. Sponsorship is a tool you reach for when someone is\ncapable of more, but is somehow blocked organizationally.\n\nSponsorship sounds like: \u201cthis is something Jasmine would be great at, why\ndon\u2019t we ask them to lead this project?\u201d\n\nThe modality of sponsorship is managing up (or sideways): using your position\nand organizational power to advocate for someone else. Other than getting the\nsponsee\u2019s permission, sponsorship doesn\u2019t really involve them directly very\nmuch: it\u2019s about advocating for them, usually in spaces they don\u2019t have access\nto. That said, you might also mentor or coach someone you\u2019re sponsoring, or\narrange for someone else to mentor/coach them, as a way of helping them be\nsuccessful.\n\nTypically, a sponsee is someone in your chain of command. It doesn\u2019t have to\nbe that way, but you need to be wary of the feelings on your team if you\u2019re\nsponsoring people outside of it. It can feel to them like you don\u2019t care as\nmuch about your own team, so be cautious.\n\nYou need to approach sponsorship carefully. If you push someone into a highly-\nvisible failure, it can mess up their career, potentially permanently. You\nneed to have have a high degree of confidence that you\u2019re putting them into a\nsituation where they\u2019ll be successful. Or if not, you should be extremely\nclear that it\u2019s a high-risk situation, and let them decide if they want to\nrisk it or not.\n\n  1. Seriously, you could teach a coaching and class management entirely through clips of Kerr coaching Curry. I love this clip of Kerr encouraging Curry during a game: Curry is have a terrible shooting night, and is down about it, so Kerr shows him stats proving that he\u2019s having a positive effect on the game despite shooting poorly. It\u2019s such a good example of helping someone reframe their work to focus on the team instead of the individual. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\nI always welcome feedback on my writing \u2014 please feel free to get in touch if\nyou have comments.
