Powell\n\nOverestimating your skills can land you in a world of trouble. Credit: Ren\u00e9\nSchmidt, Alamy\n\nDavid Dunning: \"The list of creative ways people have for reaching conclusions\nthey wish to reach and dismissing conclusions they find threatening is\namazing.\"\n\nThe Dunning-Kruger effect describes a disturbing cognitive bias that afflicts\nus all. People with limited expertise in an area tend to overestimate how much\nthey know\u2014and we all have gaps in our expertise. That disconnect may explain\nwhy some patients turn to \"Dr. Google\" to make at-home diagnoses of complex\nmedical problems, as well as the missteps we all make from time to time, from\nfixing the plumbing to representing ourselves in a court of law. Over the\nyears, the Dunning-Kruger effect has gone from a scientific hypothesis to a\npopular meme, pulled out in shouting matches across social media. In the\nhierarchy of insults, there are few more powerful than invoking the idea that\nyour opponents are so stupid that they don't even know how stupid they are.\nIt's just one step short of calling the other side a bunch of Nazis, aka\nGodwin's Law\u2014the traditional way that flame wars end.\n\nDavid Dunning, now a social psychologist at the University of Michigan, and\nJustin Kruger, now at NYU, proposed their namesake effect in a famous 1999\npaper. In a series of surveys combined with tests, they found that students\nfrom Cornell who scored in the bottom quartile estimated that they had scored\nin the third quartile, and identified related forms of unearned confidence.\nSince then, Dunning has extended his investigations into the mechanisms of\ntrust and belief. OpenMind co-editor Corey S. Powell spoke with Dunning about\nhis ubiquitous effect and how it colors self-knowledge for us all. (This\nconversation has been edited for length and clarity.)\n\n### LISTEN TO THE PODCAST\n\nOpenMind \u00b7 Expertise\n\nCorey S. Powell speaks with David Dunning on the nature of expertise\n\n### READ THE INTERVIEW\n\nThe Dunning-Kruger effect is a term that gets thrown around a lot in\narguments, especially online. People use it to say that their opponents don\u2019t\nknow what they are talking about. What\u2019s it like to have your research turn\ninto a pop-culture meme?\n\nIt's strange because public notoriety has nothing to do with scientific or\nacademic notoriety. I feel about it like Jack White of The White Stripes feels\nabout that riff from \u201cSeven Nation Army.\u201d It's everywhere, around the globe.\nJack White is tickled pink that something that he wrote passed into folk\nmusic. I feel the same way, but I wish people wouldn't use it as an invective,\nbecause it is really about being reflective about yourself and knowing that\nthere might be things you don't know. It\u2019s not about judging other people.\n\nThe common misconception is that the Dunning-Kruger effect means \u201cstupid\npeople don\u2019t know they\u2019re stupid.\u201d Can you explain the true significance of\nyour research?\n\nThe Dunning-Kruger result is a little complicated because it's actually many\nresults. The one that is a meme is this idea: On any particular topic, people\nwho are not experts lack the very expertise they need in order to know just\nhow much expertise they lack. The Dunning-Kruger effect visits all of us\nsooner or later in our pockets of incompetence. They\u2019re invisible to us\nbecause to know that you don't know something, you need to know something.\nIt\u2019s not about general stupidity. It\u2019s about each and every one of us, sooner\nor later.\n\nYou can be incredibly intelligent in one area and completely not have\nexpertise in another area. We all know very smart people who don't recognize\ndeficits in their sense of humor or their social skills, or people who know a\nlot about art but may not know much about medicine. We each have an array of\nexpertise, and we each have an array of places we shouldn't be stepping into,\nthinking we know just as much as the experts.\n\nMy philosopher friend and I call that \u201cepistemic trespassing,\u201d because you\u2019re\ntrespassing into the area of an expert. We saw this a lot during the pandemic.\nThere was a law professor who knew a little evolutionary biology and a little\nmath. He came up with a model of how many cases of COVID-19 there would be in\nthe United States, and his answer was 500, maybe 5,000. He had trespassed into\nthe realm of epidemiology, and he didn't know what he didn't know.\n\nDoes being aware of the Dunning-Kruger effect help you avoid it, or does it\nmake you even more vulnerable?\n\nOne common question I get asked is: What about you? What are your Dunning-\nKruger spots? My response is, if Justin and I are right about the Dunning-\nKruger effect, I'm the last person to know the areas where I'm incompetent.\nI'm sure I have colleagues and friends who\u2019d be very willing to fill you in.\nBut life is very good at revealing them. I think it was Vernon Law, the\nbaseball pitcher, who said that life is the cruelest teacher because it gives\nyou the test before it provides the lesson.\n\nI'm willing to listen to the lesson after the test. And I'm consigned to the\nobservation that you become a master at a science once you realize that you\nare always going to be a beginner. There are always going to be new challenges\nto face. I'm going to have to improve, to change what I do, to learn what\nmistakes I'm prone to. When I look back at my papers, including the 1999 paper\nthat caused us to have this interview, there are things I wish I could have\ndone differently. I welcome that feeling. I'm never going to be a finished\nproduct, despite my advanced age. That\u2019s the philosophy I've settled on.\n\nWe're built to be gullible. It is part of the rules that make civilization\npossible.\n\nThere have been several recent articles criticizing the 1999 Dunning-Kruger\nstudy, questioning both its methods and its conclusions. How do you respond?\n\nI'm glad you brought it up because you should know there's a critique. That's\npart of science. The critique is that the Dunning-Kruger effect is a\nstatistical artifact known as regression to the mean. People who are poor\nperformers on a test can only overestimate themselves. Those who are high\nperformers can only underestimate themselves, so it\u2019s a measurement error, an\nartifact. We talk about that issue in the original article. We did a nine-\nstudy series investigating regression to the mean. Other people have done\nstudies that call the artifact into question. The critique tends to focus on\nthe first two studies of a four-study paper in 1999. I can't dismiss the irony\nof people not taking into account the 25 years of research that have happened\nsince.\n\nAnother area of your research is decision-making. What have you learned about\nthe ways that we process information and then choose what to do?\n\nOne theme we look at is what psychologists call motivated reasoning; lay\npeople refer to it as self-deception, wishful thinking or rationalization. The\nlist of creative ways people have for reaching conclusions they wish to reach\nand dismissing conclusions they find threatening is amazing. We've shown that\nit goes down even to the level of visual perception: You literally see what\nyou want to see. If we show you wonderful chocolate truffles, they appear\nphysically closer to you than if we take those same chocolate truffles and\nform them into the shape of dog poop. The more you delve into it, the more you\nrealize the brain is interpreting what's going on all the time.\n\nWhen people are looking for advice, they often seek out authority figures who\nthey think share their values, or who believe the things they already believe\nto be true. Is there a way to break out of that pattern?\n\nRobert Heinlein, the famous science fiction author, said that it's difficult\nto learn from someone who always agrees with you. You have to find dissenting\nvoices. The best expert is plural. Look at consensus. Look at multiple\nexperts. Check out a variety of people, and watch out for just favoring the\nones who already agree with you.\n\nThis gets to another related area\u2014how we decide who to trust. Have you come up\nwith any helpful answers?\n\nIf you're a rational self-interested being, you should assume that other\npeople are rational, self-interested beings who are going to exploit you. (In\na purely rational system) you shouldn't trust other people, because they\u2019re\nnot going to reciprocate. And yet, everybody does it. That's a good thing\nbecause trust allows us to have something called civilization.\n\nIt\u2019s a mystery why we do it. Trust is especially a mystery to economists who\nbelieve in the rational-actor model. We took on that mystery by doing\nexperiments where people could trust another person with their money\u2014a\ncomplete stranger. The experiment is anonymous. If they trust the other\nperson, they can get money back at a profit. But the other person can also\ndecide to keep all the money. So the question is, do you give your money to a\nperson you've never met and never will meet. Maybe you'll get some money back\nat a profit, or maybe you'll lose all your money.\n\nAccording to a standard economic analysis, no one should give their money. But\na majority of people gave their money to a complete stranger. They trusted the\nother person, even though they thought the odds were likely that they were\nnever going to get the money back.\n\nOK, I\u2019ll bite. Why do we trust strangers, even when it\u2019s not the rational\nthing to do?\n\nIt took us 10 years, but we finally were able to document to our satisfaction\nwhat was going on. We all live in a world of norms\u2014certain principles that we\nlive by with other people, even if they're complete strangers. One\nparticularly salient norm is so well learned that we forget we even know it:\nWe do not insult other people. We have to give the money because if we don't\ngive the money, we're calling them untrustworthy. We\u2019re insulting them. And we\nwant to avoid that, even if we don't know who they are and we'll never meet\nthem. Our research suggests that a lot of our decisions, including purely\neconomic ones, are driven by social and emotional concerns.\n\nWell, people are often weird about money. Does irrational trust extend to\nother aspects of human behavior?\n\nIt\u2019s true for how we judge another person's knowledge too. Another of the\ngames we play shows that if someone tells us something, we've been taught to\nassume it's true. That's what makes us gullible. We're in an information age\nwhen people are concerned about the public being gullible to false\ninformation. But imagine if we believed that everything other people told us\nwas false. Civilization would break down! So we're built to be gullible. It is\npart of the rules that make civilization possible.\n\nI\u2019m amazed to hear you say these things since we\u2019re bombarded with stories\nabout how angry and suspicious the public has become. It sounds like you\u2019re\nsaying the opposite: We have so much kindness and politeness that we struggle\nto overcome it. Is that right?\n\nWell, that's true. But I think what's interesting about the internet and\nsocial media is that it takes us out of the setting where we learned all these\npoliteness rules. Right here, you and I are having a conversation. We're in a\nrelationship. Twitter is not that. On Twitter, I proclaim something by\nposting, and you come along a few hours later and you proclaim. We're not\ninteracting, we're proclaiming asynchronously. The kindness rules and the\npoliteness rules are not in play.\n\nMy anthropologist friends remind me that every time a new communication\ntechnology comes around, such as the telegraph or telephone, there is a\nbreakdown in social norms. Whatever politeness rules have been built up don't\nyet apply to the new platform. We're in the middle of that right now. I think\nwhat's happening with social media is that we haven't developed the politeness\nrules that we have for face-to-face interaction.\n\nOur ignorance is an everyday companion that we will all carry for the rest of\nour lives.\n\nHow do we strike the right balance: maintain enough trust for a functioning\ncivilization but keep our gullibility in check so we don\u2019t fall for every\nloud, crazy idea on the internet?\n\nIt's an interesting question, and the answer is: I don't know. It\u2019s likely\nthat scientists won't figure this out. Users will figure this out. Norms will\narise bottom-up. For example, on Facebook, a norm had to arise that when\ncouples break up, the person who was broken up with gets to announce it. That\nnorm didn\u2019t arise from a proclamation on high. This is one of the big\nquestions of the future. I just hope there are answers.\n\nIs there any way to know when we\u2019ve trespassed beyond our area of expertise in\nour own lives? And is there anything we can do about this type of blindness\nonce we are aware?\n\nThere are two types of interventions you can do. Something that you can do for\nother people is give feedback, although not all of us are skilled at giving\nfeedback. One of the best interventions was done by two chemistry professors\nwho taught these huge introductory chemistry classes. They had students\ncomplete weekly practice quizzes before they took the actual tests, so they\nfound out what they didn't know. Then the professors\u2014and this is key\u2014added a\nsecond component. They had the students sit down and plan out what they were\ngoing to do about the deficits they identified. Now they knew: You\u2019re missing\nthis, what are you going to do about it?\n\nSo is it just up to us to slog through all the issues surrounding self-\ndeception, motivated reasoning and trust?\n\nA lot of (helpful coping mechanisms) are already incorporated into\nprofessions. In law, you have another side, the opposing attorney, who is\ngoing to tell you how you're wrong. Doctors are trained to think about\nalternative diagnoses. The scientific method is aimed at disproving\nhypotheses, not proving hypotheses. In fact, you never use the term prove,\nbecause you're never certain. There are a lot of people in these professions\nout there, using these techniques every day.\n\nThat\u2019s an interesting point. Could we create social and professional\ninstitutions that do a better job of reining in our Dunning-Kruger blindspots\nand our gullibility?\n\nThat\u2019s something I'm looking at right now. Being overconfident is only human.\nI could argue that it is inevitable. We're always going to choose the course\nof action that we think is the most reasonable, so naturally we're going to\nhave some confidence in it. You'd have to evolve institutions that go: Wait a\nminute, stop and think. Those institutions would have to carry some wisdom\nthat we can thread into our own lives.\n\nThis conversation has left me unexpectedly optimistic. The real Dunning-Kruger\neffect seems a lot less damning toward human nature than the cartoon version\nthat people talk about online.\n\nYeah, it\u2019s not a question of stupidity. Our ignorance is an everyday companion\nthat we will all carry for the rest of our lives. And ignorance can be a bit\nof a trickster, darting around the corner, so we never actually get to see\nwhat it looks like. I teach a course on self-judgment, and in the first few\nweeks, I usually dwell on how meager self-insight is. The Greeks said to \u201cknow\nthyself,\u201d which turns out to be an almost impossible task. I warn my students\nnot to get depressed about this. People worry, \u201cOh no, there are all these\nthings I don't know.\u201d Well, that was true beforehand! The only difference is\nthat you now know a few more things than you did before. Maybe a few of those\nnuggets can be helpful in the future. So don't get depressed. Be optimistic.\n\nThis Q&A is part of a series of OpenMind essays, podcasts and videos supported\nby a generous grant from the Pulitzer Center's Truth Decay initiative.\n\nApril 5, 2024\n\nBack to Top\n\nRepublish\n\nCorey S.

Pair that with the human instinct\nfor overconfidence and we have a prescription for disaster in which we imagine\nourselves capable of steering any ship. This is the Dunning-Kruger effect, the\nhuman tendency to overestimate our competence. Here, OpenMind co-editor Corey\nS. Powell discusses the implications with none other than David Dunning,\nprofessor of psychology at the University of Michigan and author (along with\nJustin Kruger) of the paper that launched decades of research into how we know\nwhat we know.\n\nPamela Weintraub, co-editor, OpenMind\n\nThis conversation is part of an OpenMind series that includes a related essay\non the challenge of finding meaningful expertise about healthy eating, along\nwith a TikTok about the problems that overconfidence creates for all of us.\n\n## Share\n\nRepublish\n\n## Sign up for our newsletter\n\nTackling science controversies and deceptions\n\nOpenMind Magazine is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.
