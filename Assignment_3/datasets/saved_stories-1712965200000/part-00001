Gitlin - 4/12/2024, 3:46 PM\n\nEnlarge / BYD electric cars stand at a BYD dealership on April 05, 2024, in\nBerlin, Germany. BYD, which stands for Build Your Dreams, is a Chinese\nmanufacturer that went from making solar panels to electric cars. The company\nis seeking to gain a foothold in the German auto market.\n\nSean Gallup/Getty Images\n\n#### reader comments\n\n191\n\nInfluential US Senator Sherrod Brown (D\u2013Ohio) has called on US President Joe\nBiden to ban electric vehicles from Chinese brands. Brown calls Chinese EVs\n\"an existential threat\" to the US automotive industry and says that allowing\nimports of cheap EVs from Chinese brands \"is inconsistent with a pro-worker\nindustrial policy.\"\n\nBrown's letter to the president is the most recent to sound alarms about the\nthreat of heavily subsidized Chinese EVs moving into established markets.\nBrands like BYD and MG have been on sale in the European Union for some years\nnow, and last October, the EU launched an anti-subsidy investigation into\nwhether the Chinese government is giving Chinese brands an unfair advantage.\n\nThe EU probe won't wrap until November, but another report published this week\nfound that government subsidies for green technology companies are prevalent\nin China. BYD, which now sells more EVs than Tesla, has benefited from almost\n$4 billion (3.7 billion euro) in direct help from the Chinese government in\n2022, according to a study by the Kiel Institute.\n\nLast month, the EU even started paying extra attention to imports of Chinese\nEVs, issuing a threat of retroactive tariffs that could start being imposed\nthis summer.\n\nChinese EV imports to the EU have increased by 14 percent since the start of\nits investigation, but they have yet to really begin in the US, where there\nare a few barriers in their way. Chinese batteries make an EV ineligible for\nthe IRS's clean vehicle tax credit, for one thing. And Chinese-made vehicles\n(like the Lincoln Nautilus, Buick Envision, and Polestar 2) are already\nsubject to a 27.5 percent import tax.\n\n## An existential threat?\n\nBut Chinese EVs are on sale in Mexico already, and that has American\nautomakers worried. Last year, Ford CEO Jim Farley said he saw Chinese\nautomakers \"as the main competitors, not GM or Toyota.\" And in January, Tesla\nCEO Elon Musk said he believed that \"if there are no trade barriers\nestablished, they will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the\nworld.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBYD, which recently debuted a sub-$10,000 EV called the Seagull, is reportedly\nlooking for a factory in Mexico. That would allow it to build cars for the US\nmarket that aren't subject to the 27.5 percent tax.\n\nBut not if Congress gets its way. A few weeks ago, Joshua Hawley (R-Mo.)\u2014using\nvery similar language to Brown\u2014called for a tax increase on Chinese EVs.\nHawley wanted to raise the base tariff from 2.5 percent to 100 percent, which\nwould result in Chinese EVs being subject to an overall 125 percent import\ntax, up from today's 27.5 percent. Hawley also wanted to apply those rates to\nChinese EVs assembled in Mexico.\n\n\"A surge in Chinese EV sales would cripple the domestic manufacturing base,\nincluding critical inputs from parts suppliers to steel, tires, and glass\nproducers,\" wrote Brown, noting also that Chinese EVs could \"undermine efforts\nto reshore semiconductor production.\" Brown is similarly down on allowing\nmade-in-Mexico EVs from Chinese brands.\n\nIt's not just the potential damage to the US auto industry that has prompted\nthis letter. Brown wrote that he is concerned about the risk of China having\naccess to data collected by connected cars, \"whether it be information about\ntraffic patterns, critical infrastructure, or the lives of Americans,\"\npointing out that \"China does not allow American-made electric vehicles near\ntheir official buildings.\"\n\nAt the end of February, the Commerce Department also warned of the security\nrisk from Chinese-connected cars and revealed it has launched an investigation\ninto the matter.\n\nBrown doesn't just want a tariff on Chinese EVs, though. \"When the goal is to\ndominate a sector, tariffs are insufficient to stop their attack on American\nmanufacturing,\" Brown wrote. \"Instead, the Administration should act now to\nban Chinese EVs before they destroy the potential for the US EV market. For\nthis reason, no solution should be left off the table, including the use of\nSection 421 (China Safeguard) of the Trade Act of 1974, or some other\nauthority.\"\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How The Callisto Protocol's Gameplay Was Perfected Months Before Release\n\n#### reader comments\n\n191\n\nJonathan M.

Beginning with the original Drivatar AI in Forza Motorsport for\nXBOX in 2005, Greenawalt and his colleagues experimented with computer\nlearning, refining their methods from iteration to iteration. It was once the\nAI system was unshackled from local hard drives and placed online in Forza\nMotorsport 5, however, that the floodgates truly opened. As the AI rapidly\nevolved, producing unexpected new behaviors, the Forza team quickly learned\nhow challenging it would be to wield this two-edged sword in creating\nrealistic opponents.\n\n  * ##### How Forza's Racing AI Uses Neural Networks To Evolve\n\n  * ##### The supercharged Ferrari 488 GTB | Ars Technica\n\n  * ##### Aston Martin's DB11 V12\n\n  * ##### Fast, fun, and freaky: A review of the Alfa Romeo Stelvio\n\n  * ##### The best features of the best cars at the L.A.
