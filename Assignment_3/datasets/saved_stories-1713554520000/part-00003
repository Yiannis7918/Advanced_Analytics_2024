Now a general-purpose MCU enhances the\nRISC-V portfolio. It is the first MCU using a RISC-V core developed internally\nat Renesas.\n\nThe R9A02G021 general-purpose microcontroller features an interesting mix of\nanalog and digital peripherals, as shown in the block diagram below.\n\nImage\n\nFigure 1. R9A02G021 RISC-V MCU block diagram\n\nThe device has a generous program memory of 128KB which supports well in-field\nupdates, thanks to the small erasable block size granularity of 2KB, and the\ncapability to swap the initial 16KB startup section for implementing an\nupdatable user bootloader code. To make the update process even more reliable,\na flash shield function preserves areas from accidental erasure and the\nprotection can be made permanent.\n\nFor software IP confidentiality, a flash read protection function allows the\nuser to define a memory area to hold program code which can only be fetched\nfor execution but not read out as data. This effectively creates an executable\nsection that is protected from simple copying. Production control can be\nimplemented using the Unique ID (a read-only device unique serial number,\nprogrammed at the Renesas factory) and the User ID, a 64-bit user-defined\nvalue. The User ID can be programmed by the customer in production inside a\nhidden memory area and becomes readable only if the application image holds a\ncertain 'unlock key' value in a user-defined memory location. In this way, you\ncan make sure that only legitimate applications will have access to the\nconfidential value, which could be used further as a seed for authenticating\nexternal agents, generating data encryption keys, etc. In fact, a true random\nnumber generator hardware is embedded to support such simple but effective use\ncases.\n\nThe 16KB on-chip RAM is well dimensioned to provide the peripherals with data\nbuffering space and hold all application variables required. Almost the whole\nSRAM is protected by parity bits, for enhanced reliability 4KB are protected\nby an ECC code able to correct single and detect double bit errors. This is\nthe place to store application-critical variables that need to be additionally\nsecured from accidental environmental modifications (for example the ever-\npresent cosmic radiation particles).\n\nApplication parameters and runtime information status can be stored in a non-\nvolatile data flash memory of 4KB, erasable 1KB at the time, that can even be\nused to emulate an EEPROM.\n\nLooking at the system performance, the Renesas RISC-V CPU is achieving an\nexceptional baseline CoreMark score of 3.27CM/MHz already on an open-source\ncompiler, whilst other professional toolchains can even improve that further\n(watch for more scores to be published on the EEMBC website in future). The\nRISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA) is ideal to optimize the CPU\nimplementation and Renesas has taken care of adding several extensions which\nare very important for deeply embedded systems. The multiplication and bit\nmanipulation extensions, and the built-in hardware divider, accelerate\noperations since the same results can be achieved with fewer instructions. The\nadditional compressed instructions further contribute to code size reduction,\nfaster execution, and power saving as the number of flash program fetches is\nreduced.\n\nThe CPU has also built in a dynamic branch predictor which observes the\nprogram flow and can choose the most likely path being taken during a branch\nso that the next instruction can be executed without interrupting and flushing\nthe pipeline; this improves the total number of instructions per cycle. With\nall these CPU features combined, users can develop a very performant\napplication in such a compact device.\n\nOverall, having developed our own CPU core enables Renesas to optimize the\nimplementation, gives full control of the design choices, and secures the IP\nroadmap for future products. Renesas has historically deep experience in\nimplementing CPUs for microcontrollers. This provides customer assurance on\nthe deployment of commercially viable products, supported by renowned Renesas\nquality, and eliminates any concerns about proprietary architectures.\n\nRaw performance would be meaningless without enough I/O interfaces. This\ndevice has a well-balanced set of analog and digital peripherals to realize\nmixed-signal applications at a lower cost since many building blocks are\nalready embedded in the MCU. For example, on the analog side, there is a\n10-channel 12-bit A/D converter (ADC), a 2-channel 8-bit D/A converter (DAC),\ntwo comparators, and an on-chip temperature sensor. The ADC and comparators\ncan be used over the whole operating voltage range of 1.6V to 5.5V, and the\nADC can also input an external voltage reference, which makes it easy to adapt\nbest to the application needs.\n\nThe digital connectivity portion supports many protocols like UART, SPI, I^2C,\nand even a dedicated remote control interface. Battery-operated applications\nare covered by the excellent standby current consumption of 300nA with all\nSRAM contents retained. In this condition, the application can quickly resume\noperation in just 4\u03bcs, ready to react to the external wakeup event. Long\nstandby times can be achieved by means of a real-time clock or the internal\n32-bit low-power timer. Applications that focus on reliability will benefit\nfrom the application watchdog, a second clock-independent watchdog, a CRC\nunit, a clock monitor, and the ADC self-test logic. Even the operating\ntemperature is not a concern, because the device can operate up to a 125 \u00b0C\ntemperature without restriction.\n\nStarting with a new architecture is never easy, especially when used to\nworking with the dominant legacy and proprietary architectures established in\nthe market. It may feel like a large commitment of time and effort at the\nleast, to study the intricacies of the differences, and for the pragmatic\namong us, to grab some test platform and configure a suitable tool environment\nto explore and try things out. This is why Renesas makes your experience\nsmooth and easy, providing a full-featured set of free-of-charge tools. The\neclipse-based e2 studio IDE includes a code generator plugin, an LLVM-based\ncompiler, and a debug environment. All the building blocks required to start\ntesting a project! You can also start looking at many application notes with\nexample projects already available and more on the way.\n\nGet hold of our neat Fast Prototyping Board, it\u2019s truly the ideal hardware\nplatform...low-cost and ready to be expanded with sensing, display, and\nconnectivity functions. Do you have some PmodTM, Arduino, or Grove add-on\nmodules? Grab them and start experimenting! The onboard SEGGER J-Link enables\nyou to kick-start testing your project with just a USB-C cable. Note that the\nsame connection can also support a virtual UART-CDC channel so you can\nimplement a debug console or a control terminal for your application.\n\nThe tool bundled with the e2 studio environment is called Smart Configurator.\nIt can set up and generate the configuration code for IOs, clocks, system\nsettings, and even low-level hardware driver APIs for the peripherals. You can\nget a complete project generated with just a few mouse clicks.\n\nCommercial IDEs like IAR Embedded Workbench or SEGGER Embedded Studio already\nsupport the Renesas R9A02G021 in their RISC-V edition. The Smart Configurator\nis also available standalone and can generate projects for those IDEs to\nensure a smooth transition. What\u2019s more, SEGGER provides a special discount\nfor Renesas users developing on the R9A02G021 MCU, please refer to the\nEmbedded Studio software page for more information.\n\nRISC-V, the emerging free and open ISA, is enjoying a lot of momentum within\nthe engineering community.
