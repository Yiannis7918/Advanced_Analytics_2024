As I argued in my 2008 book, The Venturesome\n> Economy, transformative technologies \u2013 from steam engines, airplanes,\n> computers, mobile telephony, and the internet to antibiotics and mRNA\n> vaccines \u2013 evolve through a protracted, massively multiplayer game that\n> defies top-down command and control.\n\nAnother takeaway from Bhide\u2019s earlier book that I think is relevant here is\nthat consumers and businesses that adopt technology are important drivers of\ninnovation. In order to make technology practical, users adapt it and steer\nthe direction of technical progress.\n\nWhat we are seeing right now in AI is very accelerated development of\ntechnical capabilities of machine learning. But application development is not\nkeeping pace. Bhide writes,\n\n> AI spans disparate techniques \u2013 such as machine learning, pattern\n> recognition, and natural language processing \u2013 and has wide-ranging\n> applications. Their common feature is mainly aspirational \u2013 to go beyond\n> mere calculation to more speculative yet useful inferences and\n> interpretations.\n\nI added emphasis to the word \u201caspirational.\u201d The new techniques aspire to\nachieve definitive solutions to problems that previously were only imperfectly\nand partially solved. But will this occur?\n\nWill the new AI finally be able to make real-time language translation\npossible? I would bet \u201cyes.\u201d Will it be able to overcome what I call the Null\nHypothesis and transform education by enabling personal tutoring, realizing\nthe fictional Illustrated Primer of Neal Stephenson\u2019s The Diamond Age? Of that\nI am cautiously optimistic but much less certain.\n\nBhide writes,\n\n> AI developers have been at work for more than seven decades, quietly\n> inserting AI into everything from digital cameras and scanners to\n> smartphones, automatic-braking and fuel-injection systems in cars, special\n> effects in movies, Google searches, digital communications, and social-media\n> platforms. And, as with other technological advances, AI has long been put\n> to military and criminal uses.\n>\n> Yet AI advances have been gradual and uncertain....The inaccuracy of 16\n> generations of professional dictation software (I bought the first in 1997)\n> has repeatedly frustrated me.\n\nAgain, the high rate of technical improvement in AI over the past few years is\nundeniable. If software development were a sport, we would be witnessing new\nrecords being broken every week.\n\nBut the applications are way behind. Part of this is due to the Wayne Gretzky\nPrinciple. He famously said that in hockey you don\u2019t skate to where the puck\nis\u2014you skate to where it is going. If you are trying to build an application\nin the field of medical diagnostics, do you base your specifications on\nChatGPT-4 or on what you expect such models will look like in 2025? The\nGretzky Principle says to choose the latter, but that means that you will not\nhave a product this year.\n\nMost innovations do not immediately arrive in read-to-use form. Bhide writes,\n\n> As economic historian Nathan Rosenberg and many others have shown,\n> transformative technologies do not suddenly appear out of the blue. Instead,\n> meaningful advances require discovering and gradually overcoming many\n> unanticipated problems.\n\nIn his own work, for example, Bhide tried to use the latest Large Language\nModels to help in writing his latest book.\n\n> whereas I found my 1990s Google searches to be invaluable timesavers,\n> checking the accuracy of LLM responses made them productivity killers.\n> Relying on them to help edit and illustrate my manuscript was also a waste\n> of time. These experiences make me shudder to think about the buggy LLM-\n> generated software being unleashed on the world.\n\nI have said that the superpower of LLMs is that they make it easy to\ncommunicate with computers. But overcoming the models\u2019 weaknesses, notably\n\u201challucination,\u201d will take time. And a lot of application-specific\nreinforcement learning may be required.\n\nOnce developers iron out the applications, they will find that innovation\ndiffuses slowly in the world of business and consumers. Economic historian\nPaul David found that the this process took decades in the case of electric\nmotors.\n\nWhat does this mean for the existential risk scenarios? If existential risk\nfollows from technological innovation alone (as with the atomic bomb), then we\nshould be paying attention to what the leading-edge engineers are\nachieving\u2014the records that are falling in the sport of AI. But if existential\nrisk will only come from how the technology gets applied, then we need to pay\nattention to what application developers and consumers are up to, and their\nprocess of adapting new technology is slower.\n\nShare\n\n20 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n2 Restacks\n\n20\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The State of Progress in AI\n\narnoldkling.substack.com\n\n10\n\nShare\n\n10 Comments\n\nIan ShermanFlyover Analytics10 hrs agoBoth Bhide's article and this response\nare great examples of how much AI discussion is a (mostly accidental) motte-\nand-bailey fallacy. Because there's no strong definition of \"AI\" as a moniker,\nit can apply to almost anything, and by using the same term for two very\ndifferent concepts, we can all get very confused! On the one hand, machine\nlearning is really cool, allowing computers to (e.g.) generate semi-plausible\ntext (motte), and on the other, we've all seen _The Matrix_ (bailey).When\nBhide \"shudder[s] to think about the buggy LLM-generated software being\nunleashed on the world\" because of under-trained developers \"writing\" code\nwith ChatGPT copypasta, he's referring to the motte, and when he (along with\nmany commenters here and elsewhere) refers to \"existential risks to humanity,\"\nhe's referring to the bailey. ChatGPT is in no way Agent Smith from _The\nMatrix_. It just has a similar name.Expand full commentLike (2)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nDave FriedmanBuy the Rumor; Sell the News12 hrs agoI definitely think that\nSilicon Valley types overestimate the rate at which mainstream businesses and\npeople will adopt AI.
