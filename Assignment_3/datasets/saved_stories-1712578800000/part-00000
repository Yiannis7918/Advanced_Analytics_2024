Part of that privilege includes access to a trending news feed in the\nExplore tab powered by the company's artificial intelligence. The only issue?\nIt's garbage.\n\nHere's how Grok's trending news feed seems to work: The bot pulls together the\n\"top\" posts concerning any given news story, then generates a summary of the\nnews from those posts. Simple enough, and something that we've seen generative\nAI do before. But before you fire your human writers and editors and put Grok\nin charge of the news, you might want to see how exactly it's reporting works.\n\nGrok appears to be aggregating joke tweets and spitting out an AI-generated\nanswer as genuine news. You can see that from this post shared by X user\nBrettRedacted following the earthquake that shook much of the New York City\nmetro area. The bot generated the headline: \"Adams vs. Earthquake: 50,000 Cops\nin Subway Showdown,\" then reports how New York City Mayor Eric Adams is\ndeploying the NYPD to \"prevent further earthquakes,\" considering using \"robo\ncops,\" and has ordered \"every cop in the city\" to \"shoot the damn earthquake\nbefore it strikes again.\"\n\nSure, we live in weird times, but no reasonable person would ever believe that\nGrok's summary of the news was accurate. If you somehow couldn't decide for\nyourself, you could take a look at the top posts fueling that news summary,\nwhich in this case, are all joke tweets about the mayor's response to the\nearthquake.\n\n> Tweet may have been deleted\n\nThis is a sad but humorous example of the state of X in 2024. Past versions of\nthe site would have been the place to be to follow both legitimate updates on\nbreaking news like the NYC earthquake, and laugh at the jokes about the\nsituation. Now, the site treats the jokes as news. You get what you pay for, I\nguess.\n\nIt doesn't take much foresight to imagine how this situation goes from sad but\nhumorous to simply dangerous. What happens when Grok decides to \"report\" on\nsomething that seems at first glance legitimate, but is based on the rampant\nmisinformation spreading across the site? An X user may check into the Explore\npage to see that their city is being bombed, or that a candidate in their\nelection did something illegal, when neither \"story\" is actually true.\n\nWhile we can't stop the site from pushing this crap, we can all collectively\nagree to not treat Grok, or any generate AI for that matter, as a legitimate\nnews source, or an accurate summarizer of the day's top stories.\n\nLatest\n\nSee More\n\nWordle\n\nToday\u2019s Wordle Hints (and Answer) for Sunday, April 7, 2024\n\nApril 7, 2024\n\nConnections\n\nToday's NYT Connections Hints (and Answer) for Saturday, April 6, 2024\n\nApril 6, 2024\n\nPodcasts\n\nThe Podcast Landscape Is a Mess, and That\u2019s a Good Thing\n\nApril 5, 2024\n\nJake Peterson\n\nSenior Technology Editor\n\nJake Peterson is Lifehacker\u2019s Senior Technology Editor.
