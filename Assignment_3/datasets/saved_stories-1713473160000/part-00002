The tools and conventions available suggest that clear boundaries\nexist, but details about infrastructure need to make their way into the\nsoftware and details about the software need to make their way into\ninfrastructure.\n\nDeploy to Cloud\n\nNoop Cloud is currently in private preview and invite only. To learn more,\nschedule a demo or email us at hello@noop.dev.\n\nInfrastructure as code (IaC) is often introduced as a way to create a neat\nboundary between the two responsibilities. What IaC really does is bring\ngreater reliability to infrastructure by borrowing a concept from software\ndevelopment: declarative logic (and, most of the time, version control).\n\nThe scope of IaC is mostly limited to improvements in infrastructure. But the\nmain source of complexity associated with delivering software (getting the\ndeveloped software deployed) exists at the intersection between software and\ninfrastructure. Details from each need to find their way into the other. What\nensues is a negotiation process, often between individuals and teams.\n\nI think separating software from infrastructure causes more problems than it\nsolves. The running software is as much a product of the development process\nas it is infrastructure development. And it\u2019s possible to bring the two\ndisciplines closer together and give developers the ability to run their\nsoftware without overbearing operational procedures.\n\nThis is what we do at Noop. Noop redefines the boundaries between software and\ninfrastructure. It involves choices, we try to find the things about\ninfrastructre that developers care most about and make those things easy to\nuse. We want our developers to think about Applications, not Infrastructure.\n\nIf we look back, over a decade ago, platforms started prioritizing developer\nexperience. These platforms changed the perception of what a developer could\ndo on their own. They gave developers a level of control that was all at once\nmore accessible and (in most cases) less expensive than alternatives.\n\nIn some sense Noop picks up where they left off. While developer experience\nwithin individual tools is at an all-time high, agency and productivity are,\nonce again, bogged down. Best practices and conventional wisdom are more and\nmore leading to solutions associated with high costs in both service fees and\ndeveloper effort.\n\nThe irony is that individual SaaS tools (and open source alternatives) are\nactually very good at what they do, be it a log aggregation platform,\nperformance monitoring tool, CDN, whatever. The number of high quality SaaS\nand open source products and tools available today is staggering.\n\nExcept, the more we choose these specialized tools the more our work becomes\nintegration. The cumulative integration work associated with connecting\ndifferent tools complicates more than simplifies the operational\nresponsibilities of software developers.\n\nNoop is building the best set of application development primitives available\non a single fully-integrated platform\n\n## Footer\n\n### Support\n\n  * Documentation\n  * Community\n  * Help and Advice\n\n### Company\n\n  * Blog\n  * Changelog\n\n### Legal\n\n  * Privacy\n  * Terms\n  * License\n\nInstagram X.com GitHub\n\n\u00a9 2024 Noop, Inc.
