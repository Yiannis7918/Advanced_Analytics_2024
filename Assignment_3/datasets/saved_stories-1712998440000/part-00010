To\nnegotiate a turn successfully, the combined center of mass of the rider and\nthe single-track vehicle must first be leaned in the direction of the turn,\nand steering briefly in the opposite direction causes that lean.^[1] The\nrider's action of countersteering is sometimes referred to as \"giving a\nsteering command\".^[2]^[3]^: 15\n\nThe scientific literature does not provide a clear and comprehensive\ndefinition of countersteering. In fact, \"a proper distinction between steer\ntorque and steer angle ... is not always made.\"^[4]\n\nA hypothetical curve on dry asphalt\n\n## How it works[edit]\n\nImage montage showing different stages of countersteering. Here, a scooter is\ncountersteered to turn left.\n\nWhen countersteering to turn right, the following is performed:^[5]^[6]\n\n  * A torque on the handlebars to the left is applied.\n  * The front wheel will then rotate about the steering axis to the left and the tire will generate forces in the contact patch to the left.\n  * The machine as a whole steers to the left.\n  * Because the forces in the contact patch are at ground level, this pulls the wheels \"out from under\" the bike to the left and causes it to lean to the right.\n  * The rider, or in most cases the inherent stability of the bike, provides the steering torque necessary to rotate the front wheel back to the right and in the direction of the desired turn.\n  * The bike begins a turn to the right.\n\nWhile this appears to be a complex sequence of motions, it is performed by\nevery child who rides a bicycle. The entire sequence goes largely unnoticed by\nmost riders, which is why some assert that they do not do it.^[6]\n\nIt is also important to distinguish the steering torque necessary to initiate\nthe lean required for a given turn from the sustained steering torque and\nsteering angle necessary to maintain a constant radius and lean angle until it\nis time to exit the turn.\n\n  * The initial steer torque and angle are both opposite the desired turn direction.\n  * The sustained steer angle is in the same direction as the turn.\n  * The sustained steer torque required to maintain that steer angle is either with or opposite the turn^[7] direction depending on forward speed, bike geometry, and combined bike and rider mass distribution.\n\n### Need to lean to turn[edit]\n\nA bike can negotiate a curve only when the combined center of mass of bike and\nrider leans toward the inside of the turn at an angle appropriate for the\nvelocity and the radius of the turn:\n\nwhere is the forward speed, is the radius of the turn and is the acceleration\nof gravity.^[8]\n\nHigher speeds and tighter turns require greater lean angles. If the mass is\nnot first leaned into the turn, the inertia of the rider and bike will cause\nthem to continue in a straight line as the tires track out from under them\nalong the curve. The transition of riding in a straight line to negotiating a\nturn is a process of leaning the bike into the turn, and the most practical\nway to cause that lean (of the combined center of mass of bike and rider) is\nto move the support points in the opposite direction first.^[9]\n\n### Stable lean[edit]\n\nGraphs showing the lean and steer angle response of an otherwise uncontrolled\nsimplified model of a typical bike, traveling at a forward speed in its stable\nrange (in this case 6 m/s), to a positive steer torque (to the right) that\nbegins as an impulse and then remains constant. It causes an initial steer\nangle to the right, a lean to the left, and eventually a steady-state lean to\nthe left, steer angle to the left, and thus a turn to the left.\n\nAs the desired angle is approached, the front wheel must usually be steered\ninto the turn to maintain that angle or the bike will continue to lean with\ngravity, increasing in rate, until the side contacts the ground. This process\noften requires little or no physical effort, because the geometry of the\nsteering system of most bikes is designed in such a way that the front wheel\nhas a strong tendency to steer in the direction of a lean.\n\nThe actual torque the rider must apply to the handlebars to maintain a steady-\nstate turn is a complex function of bike geometry, mass distribution, rider\nposition, tire properties, turn radius, and forward speed. At low speeds, the\nsteering torque necessary from the rider is usually negative, that is opposite\nthe direction of the turn, even when the steering angle is in the direction of\nthe turn. At higher speeds, the direction of the necessary input torque often\nbecomes positive, that is in the same direction as the turn.^[7]^[10]\n\n### At low speeds[edit]\n\nAt low speeds countersteering is equally necessary, but the countersteering is\nthen so subtle that it is hidden by the continuous corrections that are made\nin balancing the bike, often falling below a just noticeable difference or\nthreshold of perception of the rider. Countersteering at low speed may be\nfurther concealed by the ensuing much larger steering angle possible in the\ndirection of the turn.^[citation needed]\n\n### Gyroscopic effects[edit]\n\nOne effect of turning the front wheel is a roll moment caused by gyroscopic\nprecession. The magnitude of this moment is proportional to the moment of\ninertia of the front wheel, its spin rate (forward motion), the rate that the\nrider turns the front wheel by applying a torque to the handlebars, and the\ncosine of the angle between the steering axis and the vertical.^[10]\n\nFor a sample motorcycle moving at 22 m/s (50 mph) that has a front wheel with\na moment of inertia of 0.6 kgm^2, turning the front wheel one degree in half a\nsecond generates a roll moment of 3.5 Nm. In comparison, the lateral force on\nthe front tire as it tracks out from under the motorcycle reaches a maximum of\n50 N. This, acting on the 0.6 m (2 ft) height of the center of mass, generates\na roll moment of 30 Nm.^[10]\n\nWhile the moment from gyroscopic forces is only 12% of this, it can play a\nsignificant part because it begins to act as soon as the rider applies the\ntorque, instead of building up more slowly as the wheel out-tracks. This can\nbe especially helpful in motorcycle racing.^[10]\n\n## Motorcycles[edit]\n\nDeliberately countersteering is essential for safe motorcycle riding, and as a\nresult is generally a part of safe riding courses run by organisations like\nthe Motorcycle Safety Foundation, the Canada Safety Council, or Australian\nQ-Ride providers. Deliberately countersteering a motorcycle is a much more\nefficient way to steer than to just lean.^[3]^: 15 At higher speeds the self-\nbalancing property of the bike gets stiffer, and a given input force applied\nto the handlebars produces smaller changes in lean angle.^[3]^: 16\n\n### Training[edit]\n\nMuch of the art of motorcycle cornering is learning how to effectively push\nthe grips into corners and how to maintain proper lean angles through the\nturn. When the need for a quick swerve to one side suddenly arises in an\nemergency, it is essential to know, through prior practice, that\ncountersteering is the most efficient way to change the motorcycle's\ncourse.^[3]^: 16 Many accidents result when otherwise experienced riders who\nhave never carefully developed this skill encounter an unexpected obstacle.\n\nTo encourage an understanding of the phenomena around countersteering, the\nphrase positive steering is sometimes used.^[11]^[12] Other phrases are \"PRESS\n\u2013 To turn, the motorcycle must lean\", \"To lean the motorcycle, press on the\nhandgrip in the direction of the turn\" or \"Press left \u2013 lean left \u2013 go\nleft\".^[13]\n\nThe Motorcycle Safety Foundation teaches countersteering to all students in\nall of its schools, as do all motorcycle racing schools. Countersteering is\nincluded in United States state motorcycle operator manuals and tests, such as\nWashington,^[14] New Jersey,^[15] California,^[16] and Missouri.^[17]\n\n### Safety[edit]\n\nAccording to the Hurt Report, most motorcycle riders in the United States\nwould over-brake and skid the rear wheel and under-brake the front when trying\nhard to avoid a collision. The ability to countersteer and swerve was\nessentially absent with many motorcycle operators.^[18] The often small amount\nof initial countersteering input required to get the bike to lean, which may\nbe as little as 0.125 seconds, keeps many riders unaware of the concept.^[19]\n\n## Multi-track vehicles[edit]\n\nSidecar on Vespa scooterTripendo recumbent tricycle, a tilting three-wheeler\n\nThree wheeled motorcycles without the ability to lean have no need to be\ncountersteered, and an initial steer torque in one direction does not\nautomatically result in a turn in the other direction. This includes sidecar\nrigs where the car is rigidly mounted on the bike. The three wheeled BRP Can-\nAm Spyder Roadster uses two front wheels which do not lean, and so it steers\nlike a car.^[20]\n\nSome sidecars allow the motorcycle to lean independent of the sidecar, and in\nsome cases, the sidecar even leans in parallel with the motorcycle. These\nvehicles must be countersteered the same way as a solo motorcycle.^[21] The\nthree wheel Piaggio MP3 uses mechanical linkages to lean the two front wheels\nin parallel with the rear frame, and so that it is countersteered in the same\nmanner as a two-wheeled motorcycle.^[20]\n\nFree-leaning multi-track vehicles must be balanced by countersteering before\nturning. Multi-track leaning vehicles that are forced-tilted, such as the\nCarver, are tilted without countersteering the control and are not balanced by\nthe operator. Later versions of the Carver introduced automatic countersteer\nto increase tilt speed and reduce the force required to tilt the vehicle.\nOther forced-tilted vehicles may incorporate automatic countersteering.^[22] A\nprototype tilting multi-track free leaning vehicle was developed in 1984 that\nemploys automatic countersteering and does not require any balancing\nskills.^[23]\n\n## Countersteering by weight shifting[edit]\n\nWith a sufficiently light bike (especially a bicycle), the rider can initiate\na lean and turn without using the handlebars by shifting body weight, called\ncounter lean by some authors.^[8]^[24]^[25]^[26] Documented physical\nexperimentation shows that on heavy bikes (many motorcycles) shifting body\nweight is less effective at initiating leans.^[27]\n\nThe following is done when countersteering using weight shifting to turn left:\n\n  * The rider applies a momentary torque, either at the seat via the legs or in the torso that causes the bike itself to lean to the right.\n  * The combined center of mass of the bike and rider is only lowered and not moved out, but if the front of the bike is free to swivel about its steering axis, the lean to the right will cause it to steer to the right by some combination of gyroscopic precession, ground reaction forces, gravitational force on an off-axis center of mass or simply the inertia of an off-axis center of mass depending on the exact geometry and mass distribution of the particular bike and the amount of torque and the speed at which it is applied.^[8]^[28]\n  * This countersteering to the right causes the ground contact to move to the right of the center of mass, as the bike moves forward, thus generating a leftward lean. Finally the front end steers to the left and the bike enters the left turn.\n\nThe amount of leftward steering necessary to balance the leftward lean\nappropriate for the forward speed and radius of the turn is controlled by the\ntorque generated by the rider, again either at the seat or in the torso.\n\nTo straighten back out of the turn, the rider simply reverses the procedure\nfor entering it: cause the bike to lean farther to the left; this causes it to\nsteer farther to the left, which moves the wheel contact patches farther to\nthe left, eventually reducing the leftward lean and exiting the turn.\n\nA National Highway Traffic Safety Administration study showed that rider lean\nhas a larger influence on a lighter motorcycle than a heavier one,^[29] which\nhelps explain why no-hands steering is less effective on heavy motorcycles.\nLeaning the torso with respect to the bike does not cause the bike to lean far\nenough to generate anything but the shallowest turns. No-hands riders may be\nable to keep a heavy bike centered in a lane and negotiate shallow highway\nturns, but not much else.\n\nComplex maneuvers are not possible using weight shifting alone because even\nfor a light machine there is insufficient control authority.^[24] Although on\na sufficiently light bike (especially a bicycle), the rider can initiate a\nlean and turn by shifting body weight,^[8] there is no evidence that complex\nmaneuvers can be performed by bodyweight alone.^[27]\n\n## Other uses[edit]\n\nMotorcycle speedway racing\n\nThe term countersteering is also used by some authors to refer to the need on\nbikes to steer in the opposite direction of the turn (negative steering angle)\nto maintain control in response to significant rear wheel slippage.^[10]\nMotorcycle speedway racing takes place on an oval track with a loose surface\nof dirt, cinders or shale. Riders slide their machines sideways, powersliding\nor broadsiding into the turns, using an extreme form of this type of\ncountersteering that is maintained throughout the turn. This also works,\nwithout power, for bicycles on loose or slippery surfaces, although it is an\nadvanced technique.\n\nThe term is also used in the discussion of the automobile driving technique\ncalled drifting.\n\n## The Wright Brothers[edit]\n\nWilbur Wright explained countersteering this way:\n\n> I have asked dozens of bicycle riders how they turn to the left. I have\n> never found a single person who stated all the facts correctly when first\n> asked. They almost invariably said that to turn to the left, they turned the\n> handlebar to the left and as a result made a turn to the left. But on\n> further questioning them, some would agree that they first turned the\n> handlebar a little to the right, and then as the machine inclined to the\n> left, they turned the handlebar to the left and as a result made the circle,\n> inclining inward.^[30]^[31]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Bicycle and motorcycle dynamics\n  * Motorcycle safety\n  * Non-minimum phase system\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Sheldon Brown. \"Countersteering\".
