Our findings reveal that several large language models (e.g.,\n> GPT-4, Claude 3) are able to perform regression tasks with a performance\n> rivaling (or even outperforming) that of traditional supervised methods such\n> as Random Forest, Bagging, or Gradient Boosting. For example, on the\n> challenging Friedman #2 regression dataset, Claude 3 outperforms many\n> supervised methods such as AdaBoost, SVM, Random Forest, KNN, or Gradient\n> Boosting. We then investigate how well the performance of large language\n> models scales with the number of in-context exemplars. We borrow from the\n> notion of regret from online learning and empirically show that LLMs are\n> capable of obtaining a sub-linear regret.\n\nComments:| 50 pages, 48 figures, preprint  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.07544 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2404.07544v1 [cs.CL] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.07544arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Robert Vacareanu [view email] [v1] Thu, 11 Apr 2024 08:12:43 UTC (10,436\nKB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled From Words to Numbers: Your Large Language\nModel Is Secretly A Capable Regressor When Given In-Context Examples, by\nRobert Vacareanu and 3 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
