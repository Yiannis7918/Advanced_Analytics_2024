He also offered deals in which six Pok\u00e9mon would be created\nfor the equivalent of roughly $30 in yen.\n\n### Pokemon Face-Off: Which Pocket Monster Is the Very Best?\n\n###\n\nPick a winner\n\nYamper\n\nDialga\n\n1ST\n\n2ND\n\n3RD\n\nSee your Results\n\nFinish playing for your personal results or see the community\u2019s!\n\nContinue playingSee results\n\nThe 36-year-old has reportedly admitted to committing the crimes at the heart\nof the ongoing investigation, while providing the justification that he did it\nto earn a living. According to Automaton, the suspect could face up to five\nyears imprisonment, and/or a fine of up to 5 million yen (over $32,600).\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that criminals have sought to make money off of Game\nFreak\u2019s wildly popular franchise. For example, In 2021 an ill-fated Pokemon\ncard heist saw one desperate man attempt to descend from a six-story building\nin order to steal a treasure trove of trading cards and cash from a Tokyo\nstore.\n\n2022 saw the trend continue, with criminals in Tokyo committing a series of\nhigh-value Pokemon burglaries, including one instance in which theives made\noff with a haul of cards worth over $60,000. Its worth noting that the raw\nlast for Pokemon \u2014 and the trouble it can land you in \u2014 is felt well beyond\nthe criminal fraternity. As a case in point January 2022 saw two Los Angeles\npolice officers fired after they ignored a call to attend a burglary in order\nto chase down a Snorlax in Pokemon Go.\n\nWhile you\u2019re here why not take a moment to check out IGN\u2019s ranking of the top\n10 best pokemon video games of all time, or discover which Pokemon our readers\nhave crowned as the very best of all time in our 2021 face off.\n\nAnthony is a freelance contributor covering science and video gaming news for\nIGN.
