Not merely to amuse you, but because they\nrealised that the easiest way to make you do what they want is to make it fun.\nTo escape their control, you must understand the creeping phenomenon of\ngamification, and how it makes you act against your own interests.\n\nThis is a story that encompasses a couple who replaced their real baby with a\nfake one, a statistician who cost the US the Vietnam War, and the biggest FBI\ninvestigation of the 20th century. But it begins with a mild-mannered\npsychologist who studied pigeons at Harvard in the Thirties. B.F. Skinner\nbelieved environment determines behaviour, and a person could therefore be\ncontrolled simply by controlling their environment. He began testing this\ntheory, known as behaviourism, on pigeons. For his experiments, he developed\nthe \u201cSkinner box\u201d, a birdcage with a food dispenser controlled by a button.\n\nSkinner\u2019s goal was to make the pigeons peck the button as many times as\npossible. From his experiments, he made three discoveries. First, the pigeons\npecked most when doing so yielded immediate, rather than delayed, rewards.\nSecond, the pigeons pecked most when it rewarded them randomly, rather than\nevery time. Skinner\u2019s third discovery occurred when he noticed the pigeons\ncontinued to peck the button long after the food dispenser was empty, provided\nthey could hear it click. He realised the pigeons had become conditioned to\nassociate the click with the food, and now valued the click as a reward in\nitself.\n\nThis led him to propose two kinds of reward: primary and conditioned\nreinforcers. A primary reinforcer is something we\u2019re born to desire. A\nconditioned reinforcer is something we learn to desire, due to its association\nwith a primary reinforcer. Skinner found that conditioned reinforcers were\ngenerally more effective in shaping behaviour, because while our biological\nneed for the primary reinforcer is easily satiable, our abstract desire for\nthe conditioned reinforcer isn\u2019t. The pigeons would stop seeking food once\ntheir bellies were full, but they\u2019d take far longer to get tired of hearing\nthe food dispenser click.\n\nSkinner\u2019s three key insights \u2014 immediate rewards work better than delayed,\nunpredictable rewards work better than fixed, and conditioned rewards work\nbetter than primary \u2014 were found to also apply to humans, and in the 20th\ncentury would be used by businesses to shape consumer behaviour. From\nfrequent-flyer loyalty points to mystery toys in McDonald\u2019s Happy Meals,\npurchases were turned into games, spurring consumers to purchase more.\n\nSuggested reading\n\n##### We need to calm down about screen time\n\nBy Timandra Harkness\n\nSome people soon began to consider whether games could be used to make people\ndo other things. In the Seventies, the American management consultant Charles\nCoonradt wondered why people work harder at games they pay to play than at\nwork they\u2019re paid to do. Like Skinner, Coonradt saw that a defining feature of\ncompelling games was immediate rewards. Most of the feedback loops in\nemployment \u2014 from salary payments to annual performance appraisals \u2014 were\ntorturously long. So Coonradt proposed shortening them by introducing daily\ntargets, points systems, and leaderboards. These conditioned reinforcers would\ntransform work from a series of monthly slogs into daily status games, in\nwhich employees competed to fulfil the company\u2019s goals.\n\nIn the 21st century, advances in technology made it easy to add game mechanics\nto almost any activity, and a new term \u2014 \u201cgamification\u201d \u2014 became a buzzword in\nSilicon Valley. By 2008, business consultants were giving presentations about\nleveraging fun to shape behaviour, while futurists gave TED Talks speculating\non the social implications of a gamified world. Underpinning every speech was\na single, momentous question: if gamification could make people buy more stuff\nand work more hours, what else could it be used to make people do?\n\nThe tone was generally utopian, because back then gamification seemed to be\nmostly a force for good. In 2007, for instance, the online word quiz FreeRice\ngamified famine relief: for every correct answer, 10 grains of rice were given\nto the UN World Food Programme. Within six months it had already given away\nover 20 billion grains of rice. Meanwhile, the software-as-a-service company,\nOpower, had gamified going green. It turned eco-friendliness into a contest,\nshowing each person how much energy they were using compared with their\nneighbours, and displaying a leaderboard of the top 10 least wasteful. The app\nhas since saved over $3 billion worth of energy. And then there was Foldit, a\ngame developed by University of Washington biochemists who\u2019d struggled for 15\nyears to discern the structure of an Aids virus protein. They reasoned that,\nif they turned the search into a game, someone might do what they couldn\u2019t. It\ntook gamers just 10 days.\n\nEven established corporations saw gamification\u2019s potential. In 2008,\nVolkswagen debuted a campaign called \u201cThe Fun Theory\u201d, based on the idea that\n\u201cfun is the easiest way to change people\u2019s behaviour for the better\u201d. Piano\nstairs were installed at a Stockholm rail station to encourage people to use\nthem instead of the escalator, leading to a 66% increase in stair use.\nVolkswagen also tried to gamify gamification itself, creating a contest for\ngood game ideas. The winning idea was a \u201cspeedcam lottery\u201d, where people who\nkept to the speed limit would be entered into a prize draw, funded by speeding\nfines.\n\nIt all seemed so simple: if we could only create the right games, we could\nmake humanity fitter, greener, kinder, smarter. We could repopulate forests\nand even cure cancers simply by making it fun.\n\nUnfortunately, that didn\u2019t happen. Instead, gamification took a less wholesome\nroute.\n\n***\n\nHumans, unlike pigeons, don\u2019t respond much to clicks; but we do respond to\nanother arbitrary sound: applause. We associate the sound of clapping hands\nnot with food, but with another primary reinforcer: esteem. And esteem appears\nto be one of the main reasons we play games. Will Storr has argued that the\nevolutionary function of games is to organise societies into hierarchies of\ncompetence, with score acting as a conditioned reinforcer of status. This\nassociation is so strong in our minds that, like the pigeons pecking the\nbutton long after the food dispenser has stopped dispensing, we\u2019ll chase\nscores long after everyone else has stopped watching.\n\nSo when, in 2009, Facebook added the \u201clike\u201d button, it abruptly created a\nscore to compete for. It motivated people to post more content \u2014 hitting\n\u201csend\u201d became like pecking a food dispenser button or activating a slot\nmachine, initiating an excitingly uncertain outcome. The post might go\ncompletely unnoticed, or hit the jackpot and go viral. Other social media\nplatforms followed, leveraging Skinner\u2019s three laws to maximise button-\npecking. They offered immediate reinforcement in the form of instant\nresponses, conditioned reinforcement in the form of \u201clikes\u201d and \u201cfollowers\u201d,\nand unpredictable reinforcement that varied with each post and each refresh of\nthe page. These features were crucial in turning social media into the world\u2019s\nmost addictive status game.\n\nBut this was just the beginning. Many in the managerial class began to wonder\nhow they could use gamification for their own ends. The Chinese Communist\nParty was among the first to apply the principles of social media to the real\nworld. In several towns and cities, it began trialling social credit schemes\nthat assign citizens a level of \u201cclout\u201d based on how well they behave. In some\nareas, such as Rongcheng and Hangzhou, there are public signs that display\nleaderboards of the highest-scoring citizens. The lowest-scoring citizens may\nbe punished with credit blacklists or throttled internet speeds.\n\nMeanwhile, in the West, gamification is used to make people obey corporations.\nEmployers like Amazon and Disneyland use electronic tracking to keep score of\nemployees\u2019 work rates, often displaying them for all to see. Those who place\nhigh on the leaderboards can win prizes like virtual pets; those who fall\nbelow the minimum rate may be financially penalised.\n\nGame features are even more pervasive in the digital world. The dating app\nZoosk works like a role-playing game, allowing you to accumulate experience\npoints simply by using the app, which unlocks new abilities, such as animated\nvirtual gifts to send to prospective dates. Meanwhile, on Tinder you can\npurchase various \u201clevel-ups\u201d \u2014 Boosts, Super Likes, and Rewinds \u2014 that\nincrease your chances of winning and compel you to keep playing to get your\nmoney\u2019s worth. And if you have no luck on dating apps, there are always AI\ngirlfriends to play with: apps like iGirl and Replika award users points for\ntheir commitment, which can be used to \u201clevel up\u201d their virtual lovers into a\nversion that is more intimate.\n\nThese are only a few examples. Virtually every kind of app, from audiobook\napps to taxicab apps to stock trading apps, now employs game mechanics like\npoints, badges, levels, streaks, progress bars, and leaderboards. Their\nubiquity attests to their success in hooking people. Gamification once\npromised to create a better society, but it\u2019s now used mainly to addict people\nto apps. The gamifiers, like Skinner\u2019s pigeons, prioritised immediate rewards\nover delayed ones, so they gamified for the next financial quarter and not for\nthe future of civilisation.\n\nSo where does this all lead? What is the endgame?\n\n***\n\nAt the University of Michigan in the mid-20th century, there was a zoologist\nnamed James V. McConnell. A strong believer in fun, he often presented his\nacademic research alongside satire and poetry, so it was difficult to tell\nwhich was which. One of the few things McConnell took seriously was\nbehaviourism. He was transfixed by Skinner\u2019s work on pigeons, and wished to\nexpand the work to humans, with an eye to creating a perfect society. In a\n1970 Psychology Today article he wrote: \u201cWe should reshape our society so that\nwe all would be trained from birth to want to do what society wants us to do.\nWe have the techniques now to do it. Only by using them can we hope to\nmaximize human potentiality.\u201d In short, he wanted to turn society into a\nSkinner box.\n\nA decade later, McConnell noticed how captivated people could become by video\ngames like Donkey Kong and Pac Man, and he became one of the first proponents\nof gamification. He pitched an ambitious project to gamify education to tech\ncompanies such as Microsoft and IBM, but he was 30 years too early, and they\ncouldn\u2019t yet see its promise. There was, however, one person who\u2019d taken a\nkeen interest in McConnell\u2019s work. His name was Ted Kaczynski.\n\nKaczynski had come to Michigan as a postgraduate from Harvard, where he\u2019d\nstudied mathematics and graduated at just 18. But at Harvard, he\u2019d also been\nsubjected to cruel experiments. In a lab not far from where Skinner had once\nexperimented with pigeons, psychologists linked to US intelligence were now\nexperimenting with humans \u2014 one of whom was Kaczynski. Under the glare of\nblinding lights, he was methodically humiliated to see how he reacted. He\nclaimed the experience didn\u2019t affect him, and yet, within just a few years, he\ndeveloped a paranoia about psychological conditioning and mind control. And\nso, when Kaczynski learned of McConnell\u2019s proposals to turn society into a\nSkinner box, he concluded that the jocular professor was an existential threat\nto humanity, and that he needed to die.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a decision Kaczynski had made lightly; he\u2019d developed an entire\nphilosophy to justify it. Influenced by techno-dystopian writers such as\nAldous Huxley and Jacques Ellul, Kaczynski believed the Industrial Revolution\nhad turned society into a cold process of production and consumption that was\ngradually crushing everything humans valued most: freedom, happiness, purpose,\nmeaning, and the ecosystem. In his view, everything society now produced \u2014\nincluding science and technology \u2014 served society, not humanity, and thus was\nincreasingly being purposed not to enrich our lives but to psychologically\ncondition us so we wouldn\u2019t resist what was being done to us and to the earth.\n\nMore from this author\n\n##### Is liberal society making us ill?\n\nBy Gurwinder Bhogal\n\nIn short, where society had once been shaped to accommodate people, now people\nwere being shaped to accommodate society. And this mis-shaping made people\nanxious and depressed because it conflicted with our deepest nature.\n\nKaczynski believed modern society made us docile and miserable by depriving us\nof fulfilling challenges and eroding our sense of purpose. The brain evolved\nto solve problems, but the problems it had evolved for were now largely solved\nby technology. Most of us can now obtain all our basic necessities simply by\nbeing obedient, like a pigeon pecking a button. Kaczynski argued that such\nconveniences didn\u2019t make us happy, only aimless. And to stave of this\naimlessness, we had to continually set ourselves goals purely to have goals to\npursue, which Kaczynski called \u201csurrogate activities\u201d. These included sports,\nhobbies, or chasing the latest product that ads promised would make us happy.\nFor Kaczynski, the result of reorienting our lives to chase artificial goals\nwas that we became increasingly dependent on society to provide us with them.\nAnd without our own inherent sense of purpose, we\u2019d inevitably be made to\nchase goals that were good for the industrial machine but bad for us.\n\nKaczynski\u2019s theories eerily prophesy the capture of society by gamification.\nWhile he overlooked the benefits of technology, he diligently noted its\ndangers, recognising its role in depriving us of purpose and meaning. Today\nthe evidence is everywhere: religion is dying out, Western nations are\nculturally confused, people are getting married less and having fewer\nchildren, and AI is reducing the need for labour, so the traditional pillars\nof life \u2014 God, nation, family, and work \u2014 are crumbling, and people are losing\ntheir value systems. Amid such uncertainty, games, with their well-defined\nrules and rewards, provide a semblance of order and purpose that may otherwise\nbe lacking in people\u2019s lives. Gamification is thus no accident, but an attempt\nto plug a widening hole in society.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems to be only a sticking plaster. Kaczynski observed that\nsurrogate activities rarely kept people contented for long. There were always\nmore stamps to collect, a better car to buy, a higher score to achieve. He\nbelieved artificial goals were too divorced from our actual needs to truly\nsatisfy us, so they instead kept us too busy to notice our dissatisfaction.\nRather than a fulfilled life, a life filled full. Today, people increasingly\nlive inside their phones, bossed around by notifications, diligently\ncollecting badges and filling progress bars, even though it doesn\u2019t make them\nhappy. On the contrary, substantial research comprising over a hundred studies\nfinds that prioritising extrinsic goals over intrinsic goals \u2014 in other words\ndoing things to win prizes and achieve high scores rather than for the\nintrinsic love of doing them \u2014 leads in the long term to lower well-being.\n\n\u201cPeople increasingly live inside their phones, bossed around by notifications,\ndiligently collecting badges and filling progress bars\u201d\n\nKaczynski seemed to recognise this long before the arrival of smartphones. He\nfelt that building a life around chasing what was offered on billboards and in\nmagazines wouldn\u2019t make him happy, and would only feed the Machine, so in 1971\nhe fled industrial society, holing himself up in a log cabin in the Montana\nwilderness. There he attempted a simple and self-sufficient life, enjoying the\nsmall things like the sound of birds singing and the feeling of the sun on his\nback.\n\nBut this idyll wouldn\u2019t last. While hiking across one of his favourite spots \u2014\na rocky ridge with a waterfall \u2014 he was aghast to find a road had been built\nacross it. As he saw it, industrialisation, like some creeping fungus, had\nfollowed him even here. Enraged, he decided modernity couldn\u2019t be escaped, and\nhad to be destroyed. His emotional instability got the better of him, and in\n1978 he began posting bombs to those he accused of betraying humanity. In\n1985, a package arrived at McConnell\u2019s home. It was opened by his assistant,\nNicklaus Suino. The package only partially exploded, injuring Suino and\nMcConnell, and leaving them both shaken for life.\n\nThey were lucky. Less than a month later, Kaczynski would send another, more\ncarefully prepared bomb to computer store owner, Hugh Scrutton, who\u2019d become\nKaczynski\u2019s first murder victim.\n\nBy then, the FBI\u2019s investigation into the bombings had grown into the largest\nin its history. For over a decade they scoured the country as Kaczynski\ncontinued to kill and injure, but much of their time, money, and manpower was\nwasted chasing mirages, for Kaczynski would often scatter his bomb parcels\nwith red herrings such as notes referencing fictitious conspiracies and signed\nwith made-up initials.\n\nKaczynski\u2019s actions, though unforgivable, can teach us as much about\ngamification as his philosophy. His red herrings lured people away from what\nthey actually sought, and this is also what gamified goals threaten to do. To\nunderstand how, we must consider a human error known as surrogation.\n\n***\n\nWhile Kaczynski wanted to demolish industrial society and return humanity to\nan agrarian life, US defence secretary Robert McNamara wanted the opposite: to\nuse American industrial might to crush the agrarian society of Vietnam.\n\nMcNamara was a statistician who believed what couldn\u2019t be measured didn\u2019t\nmatter. He charted progress in the Vietnam war by body count because it was\nsimple to measure. It became his way of keeping score. But his focus on what\ncould be easily measured led him to overlook what couldn\u2019t: negative public\nopinion of the US Army both at home and in Vietnam, which deflated US morale\nwhile boosting enemy conscription. In the end, the US was forced to withdraw\nfrom the war, despite winning the battle of bodies, because it had lost the\nbattle of hearts and minds.\n\nThus, the McNamara fallacy, as it came to be known, refers to our tendency to\nfocus on the most quantifiable measures, even if doing so leads us from our\nactual goals. Put simply, we try to measure what we value, but end up valuing\nwhat we measure. And what we measure is rarely what we mean to value. As\nSkinner showed, the goals of games \u2014 points, badges, trophies \u2014 are secondary\nreinforcers that only derive their worth due to their association with\nsomething we actually desire. But these associations are often illusory. A\nclick is not the same thing as a food pellet. And points are not the same as\nprogress.\n\nWe\u2019re easily motivated by points and scores because they\u2019re easy to track and\nenjoyable to accrue. As such, scorekeeping is, for many, becoming the\nfoundation of their lives. \u201cLooksmaxxing\u201d is a new trend of gamified beauty,\nwhere people assign scores to physical appearance and then use any means\nnecessary to maximise their score. And in the online wellness space, there is\nnow a \u201cRejuvenation Olympics\u201d complete with a leaderboard that ranks people by\ntheir \u201cage reversal\u201d. Even sleep has become a game; many people now use apps\nlike Pok\u00e9mon Sleep that reward them for achieving high \u201csleep scores\u201d, and\nsome even compete to get the highest \u201csleep ranking\u201d.\n\nMost such scores are simplifications that don\u2019t tell the whole story. For\ninstance, sleep trackers only measure what\u2019s easy to measure, like movement,\nwhich says nothing about crucial facts such as time spent in rapid-eye-\nmovement sleep. A more accurate measure of how well you slept would be how\nrefreshed you feel in the morning, but since this can\u2019t be quantified, it\ntends to be ignored. Further, if increasing one\u2019s youthfulness score requires\na daily two-hour skincare routine, a diet of 50 pills each day, abstention\nfrom many of life\u2019s pleasures, and constant fixation on one\u2019s vital metrics,\nis it really worth it? Of what value is adding a few years to your life if the\ncost is a life worth living? The scores we use to chart progress can\u2019t\narticulate the nuances of reality, and yet we often tie our life goals and\neven self-worth to such arbitrary numbers.\n\nSuggested reading\n\n##### We need to talk about ZOE\n\nBy Deborah Cohen and Margaret McCartney\n\nIn the end, Kaczynski himself was led astray by red herring goals. In 1995, he\nenacted his endgame, demanding the New York Times and Washington Post print\nhis anti-technology manifesto to prevent further bloodshed. All along, his\ngoal had been to get the widest possible newspaper coverage, to maximise how\nmany people would see his manifesto, but like McNamara, he didn\u2019t account for\nwhat couldn\u2019t be quantified, such as how people would see his manifesto.\nSkinner\u2019s pigeons had learned to desire the click of the food dispenser\nbecause it had been accompanied by food, and Kaczynski\u2019s intended audience\nlearned to hate his arguments because they had been accompanied by violence.\nBy maximising audience size at the expense of everything else, Kaczynski\ngained a massive audience unwilling to give him a fair hearing.\n\nFurther, his manifesto contained a peculiar choice of words (\u201ceat your cake\nand have it\u201d), which was recognised by his brother, David, who alerted the\npolice, leading to Kaczynski\u2019s capture. And so, by fixating on the most\nobvious metric \u2014 the size of his audience \u2014 Kaczynski lost the one thing he\u2019d\nbeen fighting for all along: freedom.\n\nKaczynski played the wrong game, and was trapped by it. Today, we all face\nsimilar traps. We chase numbers and icons because they\u2019re always available,\nand the chase is often so immersive that it keeps us from seeing where it\nleads, which is often far away from what we actually seek. This can lead to\nwhat the evolutionary psychologist Diana Fleischman calls \u201ccounterfeit\nfitness\u201d: the constant, momentary \u201cwins\u201d that come with playing digital games\ngive us a false sense of progression and accomplishment, a neurochemical high\nthat feels like victory but is not, and which, if it becomes a habit, risks\noverriding our actual ambitions.\n\nIt explains why so many young men have lost themselves in video games, and are\nno longer in employment or relationships. The false signals they\u2019re getting\nfrom video game progress, combined with the sexual reward of online porn, are\nconvincing their dopamine pathways that they\u2019re winning in life, even as their\nminds and futures atrophy. It\u2019s easy to persuade people into tying their sense\nof progress to fake or trivial goals. Casinos keep their customers happily\nlosing money by distracting them with minor side games they\u2019re likely to win.\nThe small victories convince them they\u2019re winning overall even as they lose\nthe only games that actually matter.\n\nSuggested reading\n\n##### Climate science is making you miserable\n\nBy Tom Chivers\n\nThis strange quirk of human behaviour can even cost lives. In South Korea, a\nyoung couple became so addicted to raising a virtual baby that they let their\nreal baby starve to death. The parents prioritised what they could quantify \u2014\nlevelling up their virtual baby \u2014 over that which they couldn\u2019t \u2014 the life of\ntheir real one.\n\nWhat makes pathological gameplaying so dangerous is that the more harm it\ndoes, the more alluring it becomes. If your baby is dead, why not raise a\nvirtual one? If your life of playing video games has stopped you finding a\ngirlfriend, why not play the AI girlfriend game? Thus, bad games form a\nfeedback loop: they distract us from pursuing the things that will bring us\nlasting contentment, and without this lasting contentment, we become ever more\ndependent on false, transient metrics such as scores, trophies, and\nleaderboards to imbue our lives with meaning.\n\nAll the things a gamified world promises in the short term \u2014 pride, purpose,\nmeaning, control, and happiness \u2014 it threatens in the long term. It has the\npower to seclude people from reality, and to rewrite their value systems so\nthey prioritise the imaginary over the real, and the next moment over the rest\nof their lives.\n\nFortunately, there is a solution.\n\n***\n\nIn prison, Kaczynski wrote a little-known sequel to his manifesto, entitled\nAnti-Tech Revolution: Why and How, in which he outlines his belief that all\nsufficiently advanced civilisations become trapped in fatal games. To\nillustrate his point, he employs a thought experiment involving a forested\nregion occupied by several rival kingdoms. The kingdoms that clear the most\nland for agriculture can support a larger population, affording them a\nmilitary advantage. Every kingdom must therefore clear as much forest as\npossible, or face being conquered by its rivals. The resulting deforestation\neventually leads to ecological disaster and the collapse of all the kingdoms.\nThus, a trait that is advantageous for every kingdom\u2019s short-term survival\nleads in the long term to every kingdom\u2019s demise.\n\nKaczynski was describing a \u201csocial trap\u201d, a term coined by a student of\nSkinner, John Platt, who had theorised that an entire population behaving like\npigeons in a Skinner box, each acting only for the next immediate reward,\nwould eventually overexploit a resource, causing ruin for everyone. What Platt\ncalled \u201csocial traps\u201d, Kaczynski called \u201cself-propagating systems\u201d, because he\nviewed them as negative-sum games that took on a life of their own, defeating\nevery player to become the only winner. He believed such games were an\ninevitable consequence of technological advancement, and had to be stopped\nbefore they reached a critical mass of players and became \u201calive\u201d.\n\nIn jail, Kaczynski was forbidden access to the web, and in letters he\nstruggled to understand what Facebook was. Nevertheless, his warnings could\neasily have been referring to social media. On Instagram, the main self-\npropagating system is a beauty pageant. Young women compete to be as pretty as\npossible, going to increasingly extreme lengths: digital filters, mask-like\nmakeup, plastic surgery. The result is that all women begin to feel ugly,\nonline and off. On TikTok and YouTube, there is another self-propagating\nsystem where pranksters compete to outdo each other in outrageousness to avoid\nbeing buried by the algorithm. Such extreme brinkmanship frequently leads to\ninjury, and has even led to the deaths of, among others, Timothy Wilks and\nPedro Ruiz.\n\nOn X, meanwhile, there lives a self-propagating system known as \u201cthe culture\nwar\u201d. This game consists of trying to score points (likes and retweets) by\nattacking the enemy political tribe. Unlike in a regular war, the combatants\ncan\u2019t kill each other \u2014 only make each other angrier \u2014 so little is ever\nachieved, except that all players become stressed by constant bickering. And\nyet they persist in bickering, if only because their opponents do, in an\nendless cycle of mutually assured distraction.\n\nThose are just three examples of social traps that have emerged in our\ngamified age. But the most worrying social trap is gamification itself. Every\ncompany that exploits our gameplaying compulsion to sell its products will\nhave an edge over those who do not, which forces every company to compete to\ngamify in ever more addictive ways, even though in the long term this harms\neveryone. As such, gamification is not just a fad; it is the fate of a digital\ncapitalist society. Anything that can be turned into a game sooner or later\nwill be. Games will be created not just to extract money from people, but also\ndata.\n\nMore from this author\n\n##### 33 concepts to survive the year\n\nBy Gurwinder Bhogal\n\nThe 2025 Enhanced Games, for instance, is a new futuristic version of the\nOlympics, funded by tech moguls including Peter Thiel, where contestants can\nexploit anything from cybernetic implants to performance-enhancing substances\nto get a competitive advantage. The purpose of the games seems to be\ntranshumanist: to motivate people to discover new ways to augment human\nabilities, with the eventual goal of turning men into gods. There is, after\nall, a vacancy in heaven. When God is dead, and nations are atomised, and\nfamily seems burdensome, and machines can beat us at our jobs and even at art,\nand trust and truth are lost in a roiling sea of AI-generated clickbait \u2014 what\nis left but games?\n\nThis isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. Games can motivate us to destroy\nourselves, but they can also motivate us to better ourselves. In a gamified\nworld, it\u2019s possible to play without getting played, if one only chooses the\nright games. As the poker player-turned-podcaster Liv Boeree said:\n\u201cIntelligence is knowing how to win the game. Wisdom is knowing which game to\nplay.\u201d So how do you decide which games to play? The story of gamification\noffers five broad rules.\n\nFirst: choose long-term goals over short-term ones. Short, frequent feedback\nloops offer regular reinforcement, which helps motivate us. But what is made\nto motivate us too often addicts us. So consider the long-term outcomes of the\ngames you\u2019re playing: if you did the same thing you did today for the next 10\nyears, where would you be? Play games the 90-year-old you would be proud of\nhaving played. They won\u2019t care how many trophies you have; they will care how\nmany times you saw your parents before they died.\n\nSecond: choose hard games over easy ones. Since the long-term value of games\nlies in their ability to hone skills and build character, easy games are\nusually a trap. People with unearned wealth \u2014 thieves, heirs and lottery\nwinners \u2014 often end up losing it all, because the struggle to obtain a reward\nteaches us the reward\u2019s worth, and is thus a crucial part of the reward.\n\nThird: choose positive-sum games over zero-sum or negative-sum ones. Games\nevolved to confer status, and status is zero-sum \u2014 for some to have it, others\nmust lose it. But we no longer have to play such games; we can change the\nrules so a win for me doesn\u2019t mean a loss for you. Educational games are one\nexample. Wealth creation is another. Positive-sum games \u2014 where every player\nbenefits by playing \u2014 are a form of competition that brings people together\ninstead of driving them apart.\n\nFourth: choose atelic games over telic ones. Atelic games are those you play\nbecause you enjoy them. Telic games are those you play only to obtain a\nreward. Chasing trophies and leaderboard rankings can help drive us to\nsucceed, but a fixation on such rewards can become a source of stress, and can\neven make leisure activities feel like drudgery, turning games into work.\n\nFinally, the fifth rule is to choose immeasurable rewards over measurable\nones. Seeing numerical scores increase is satisfying in the short term, but\nthe most valuable things in life \u2014 freedom, meaning, love \u2014 can\u2019t be\nquantified.\n\n\u201cThe most valuable things in life \u2014 freedom, meaning, love \u2014 can\u2019t be\nquantified.\u201d\n\nThere are an overwhelming number of games to choose from. If you want to keep\nfit, try Zombies Run, an app that takes the form of a post-zombie-apocalypse\nradio broadcast telling you which direction to run to avoid being eaten. If\nyou want to learn general knowledge while helping those in poverty, play the\nFreeRice quiz. If you want to learn a new language, try Duolingo. And if you\nwant to form good habits, there\u2019s Habitshare, which lets your friends track\nyour attempts, motivating you more than if you were only accountable to\nyourself.\n\nBut if, among the countless games out there, you can\u2019t find one right for you,\nthen you can just create your own. By now there\u2019s an app to keep any kind of\nscore, and an AI to formulate any possible ruleset. Kaczynski killed himself\nlast summer, still adamant humanity was doomed. His disturbing legacy has\nsince passed to his disciples, such as the Liverpool man Jacob Graham, who was\nlast month jailed for terrorism after trying to emulate his idol. Graham may\nhave thought he was saving the world, but, with all his talk of maximising\nkill counts, he was just playing a bad game.\n\nIn the end, Kaczynski and his followers made the same mistake as Skinner: they\nviewed us as mere puppets of our environment, devoid of agency and the ability\nto adapt. They needn\u2019t have feared the world becoming a Skinner box because,\namong all the papers written about that troublesome contraption, one fact is\nalways omitted: Skinner\u2019s pigeons only kept pecking the button because they\nwere in a cage, and had nothing else to do. But you are still free. Even in a\nworld where everything is a game, you don\u2019t have to play by other people\u2019s\nrules; you have a wide open world to create your own.\n\nYour move.\n\nGurwinder Bhogal is a freelance writer.

I cannot help but suspect that the actual story of\nKaczynski\u2019s identification has been obscured. Perhaps his brother had other\n\u2018clues\u2019 but this made for a story convenient to all.\n\nLast edited 30 minutes ago by Gerry Quinn\n\n0\n\n0\n\nReply\n\n##### Explore\n\n  * Politics\n  * Culture\n  * Science\n  * Faith\n  * War\n  * Society\n\n##### Quick Links\n\n  * Events Calendar\n  * UnHerd Club\n  * Our Mission\n  * Terms & Conditions\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Community Guidelines\n  * Contact Us\n\n##### Contribute to UnHerd\n\nWe welcome applications to contribute to UnHerd \u2013 please fill out the form\nbelow including examples of your previously published work.
