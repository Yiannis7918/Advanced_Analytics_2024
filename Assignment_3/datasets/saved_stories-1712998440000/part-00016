His adage is now over a decade old and political correctness\nas a concept has been subsumed within that of woke, but Sailer\u2019s\ncharacterisation is as valid as ever. In today\u2019s Britain there is more to\nnotice than ever before, while simultaneously the taboo against it keeps\ngrowing stronger. What this means is that people\u2019s natural perceptiveness\nabout the patterns of human behaviour they observe is dulled, either\nsubconsciously, by their own self-censoring mechanisms, or deliberately, by\nthose of the institutions they inhabit.\n\nOne recent example is the General Medical Council\u2019s \u201ctargets to address areas\nof inequality\u201d. The GMC aims to \u201celiminate two areas of inequality affecting\ndoctors\u201d which are that \u201cethnic minority doctors are twice as likely to be\nreferred to us by their employer than white doctors\u201d and that \u201cdoctors who\ngained their medical degree outside the UK are three times more likely to be\nreferred to us than doctors who took their medical degree in the UK.\u201d If you\nwere into noticing things, you might be able to think of some valid reasons\nwhy doctors who qualified outside the UK are more likely to be referred to the\nUK regulator than those who qualified in the UK, and then to consider perhaps\nwhether this disparity is an indictment of our policy of importing medical\nstaff rather than training sufficient numbers of our own. If you were not into\nnoticing though, or more likely if you were forbidden from noticing either by\nself or organisational censorship, then you would view this statistic as\nmerely \u201can area of inequality to be eliminated\u201d, as the GMC appears to. The\nGMC\u2019s responsibility is supposed to be to \u201cprotect, promote and maintain the\nhealth and safety of the public\u201d, yet this is clearly not what they are\nprioritising here: one of many examples of where the demands of DEI override\nan institution\u2019s actual purpose. As for the other area of inequality, ethnic\nminority doctors vs white doctors, this one could indeed be down to unfair\ndiscrimination, it could be some other factor, or it could be a combination,\nbut given what we know about the anti-racist philosophies behind DEI\ninitiatives, the same anti-noticing taboo would preclude a fair minded\ninvestigation. I wouldn\u2019t put it past the GMC to have not separated UK vs non-\nUK qualified ethnic minority doctors in the statistics, which would mean the\nfirst \u201carea of inequality\u201d would be a function of the second.\n\nAnother example of the war on noticing is the controversy over high rates of\nschool exclusions supposedly experienced by black children, which violate\nschools\u2019 statutory duty not to discriminate against pupils over race. If you\nwere into noticing things then you might note that the high rates apply only\nto black Caribbean children, not to black African ones (who have lower\nexclusion rates than white pupils overall) and therefore you would conclude\nthat it is in fact clearly nothing to do with racial discrimination by schools\nat all but rather about cultural and/or economic factors in the caribbean\npopulation (and indeed to some extent in the white British population as well,\nconsidering they have higher exclusion rates than most immigrant groups). If\nyou were not into or forbidden from noticing though, as Southwark Council\nseems to be, then you might decide to stop excluding disruptive pupils at all\nbecause you were afraid doing so might mean you\u2019re racist. Of course, even if\nthe African/Caribbean difference was absent this does not necessarily mean\nthat the cause of overrepresentation would be racism, but the obvious cultural\nreasons in this case make it an especially egregious example of easily\navoidable stupidity.\n\nThen there\u2019s the ever growing list of female sex offenders who turn out to be\ntrans women. \u201cTrans women are women\u201d is a perfect example of a statement of\nallegiance to the war on noticing. TWAW as an ideal can be preserved in some\ncontexts such as white-collar workplaces where inherent sex differences can be\nelided, but the problem for its advocates is that in other contexts where\nthese differences are more noticeable it becomes laughable. Real female sex\noffenders are so rare that it only takes a small number of male ones who are\nor who claim to be trans women to massively skew the statistics, as J. K.\nRowling recently illustrated. As of March 2021 around half of women imprisoned\nfor sex offences were trans women, despite them making up only 0.0016 per cent\nof the general female population. If nothing else, at least these trans sex\noffenders are doing their bit for gender equality in fields where women have\ntraditionally been underrepresented.\n\n> The taboo on noticing demonstrably contributed to the deaths of 22 people\n> and the maiming of hundreds of others\n\nThe twenty two people murdered by Salman Abedi in the 2017 Manchester Arena\nbombing were literally victims of the war on noticing. During the public\ninquiry into the bombing a security guard admitted that he did not approach\nthe bomber for fear of being branded racist: \u201cI did not want people to think I\nam stereotyping him because of his race ... I was scared of being wrong and\nbeing branded a racist if I got it wrong and would have got into trouble\u201d he\nsaid. Isn\u2019t it quite incredible that this admission has been widely known now\nfor years yet no lessons have been learned? The taboo on noticing demonstrably\ncontributed to the deaths of 22 people and the maiming of hundreds of others,\nbut this is generally ignored and we are encouraged instead to not look back\nin anger and instead to ramp up the war on noticing.\n\nI could go on and on. The war on noticing contributed to the abysmal response\nof the authorities to grooming gangs. It is behind the many examples over the\nyears of the Met Police being forced to change their approach to tackling\ncrime solely because black men were overrepresented as perpetrators. And\nbehind the battle to convince the public that trans women have no inherent\nadvantages and so should be able to compete in womens\u2019 sport. Forbidding\npeople from noticing isn\u2019t simply politeness, it has real costs, both for\nvictims of crime, terrorism and antisocial behaviour, but also in a broader\nmore spiritual sense: it is degrading for those of us who prefer to trust the\nevidence of our own eyes and our own reason over what we are told to believe.\n\n### Is the war on noticing fatal for society?\n\nHow dangerous for a society is the war on noticing? Today\u2019s ruling opinion\nseems to hold that the aforementioned victims merely represent acceptable\ncollateral damage and that the show can go on rolling indefinitely. Some\nthinkers, though finding wokeness to be distasteful themselves, have sought to\njustify it from a functional perspective as a largely symbolic and relatively\nlow cost way to include groups which do not compete sufficiently well in\nliberal meritocracies. Anatoly Karlin for example has claimed that \u201cwokeness\nis the tribute that meritocracy pays to human dignity\u201d. As an example Karlin\nhas compared the divergent fates of Sam Brinton (celebrated as the first\ngenderfluid person in US federal government leadership) with Russian defence\nminister Sergei Shoigu. Brinton, an interesting figure who somewhat resembles\nFeyd-Rautha Harkonnen from the recent Dune 2 (in a dress), was flying high\nuntil two unfortunate incidents came to light where he was found to have been\nstealing womens\u2019 luggage from airport carousels. He was then quietly binned.\nIn Russia however, Shoigu, though known chiefly for his incompetence and\ncorruption, has continued in his post for over a decade due to his loyalty to\nPutin. Karlin thus assesses wokeness as being manageable and much less\ndamaging than conservative crony authoritarianism. I agree with Karlin on this\n\u2014 I too would prefer, if I was forced to choose between them, a regime that\ncelebrated but then binned Sam Brinton over one that elevated and continued to\nsupport Sergei Shoigu. The US government in this case did \u201cmanage\u201d the war on\nnoticing such that DEI considerations did not override actual criminality when\nit came down to it. Unlike Karlin, however, I do not think that Putin\u2019s Russia\nor wokeness are the only two choices available to us.\n\nAnother example of an organisation that seemingly managed the war on noticing\nis Google, which for many years proudly highlighted its diversity programmes\nin public while in reality continuing to hire predominantly white and Asian\nmen as engineers in order to keep the show on the road. This is why James\nDamore had to go when he spoke up in his famous memo against \u201cGoogle\u2019s\nIdeological Echo Chamber\u201d: the ideology could be ignored or worked around but\nit could not be challenged openly. Damore perhaps unfortunately fell victim to\nRichard Hanania\u2019s \u201canti-woke as autism\u201d theory, whereby \u201canti-wokeness strikes\nme as a kind of autism, mistaking social desirability bias for underlying\nreality.\u201d Damore perhaps thought that if he could only explain the logical\nflaws in Google\u2019s diversity policies, the company bureaucracy would come\naround to his side. A more sensible Damore would have worked more\nstrategically to build alliances against DEI among power-brokers within\nGoogle. More recently though, with the embarrassment surrounding the Gemini\nrelease which portrayed things like black vikings and native American founding\nfathers, the costs of the war on noticing may finally have caught up to\nGoogle. Holding officially to an ideology that you do not in reality fulfil\ncan seem like a good solution for a while, but what happens when people in the\norganisation don\u2019t get the memo and actually do start trying to fulfil it? The\nwar on noticing is not necessarily fatal, at least not directly and\nimmediately. What it does do though is degrade institutions and repress the\nmost perceptive people in them, which over time leads to both material and\nspiritual decline.\n\n### The war on noticing is not inevitable\n\nIf you had asked me a few years ago I would have been quite a doomer on this\nissue, viewing the seemingly inexorable strengthening of taboos against\nnoticing as an inevitable consequence of the need to manage a diverse society.\nI still think that these taboos are enabled by increasing diversity and that\nthe failure to think hard about the costs of the immigration-driven\ntransformation of Britain has been the worst failing of our ruling class in\nthe last fifty years at minimum. However, more recently I have come to see our\ncurrent situation more as a consequence of the ideology that has taken hold of\nthis ruling class. The situation is certainly abetted by diversity, but it is\nnot made inevitable by it.\n\nThere is no reason to believe that there is an especially large number of\npeople in Britain, of whatever background, who are on board with the war on\nnoticing. Those that are can perhaps be conceptualised as the 13 per cent of\nthe population who the More in Common report on 2020s Britain described as\nProgressive Activists, who have sharply divergent views on most social issues\nfrom the rest of the country. This group is, to give one illustrative example,\nthe only subset of the population where over half think that workplaces do not\nfocus enough on diversity and inclusion. Or for an example more relevant to\nthe war on noticing, stop and search, a policy which is of course frequently\nbranded as racist by progressive activist types. Even among black people, who\nare generally deemed by this sort of person to be the most unfairly targeted\ngroup, slightly more support than oppose it, while among all other ethnic\ngroups, the numbers are more in support. I am confident that we would find the\nsame results in opinions of how to deal with disruptive behaviour in schools,\ncrime, illegal immigration and terrorism. It is not Nigerian parents for\nexample, who are the ones clamouring for \u201cno exclusions\u201d policies in schools.\n\n> Elite opinion is what really counts for shaping a society\u2019s ideological\n> makeup in the long term\n\nThis is not to argue that Britain will be saved by the common sense of the\npeople buttressed by injections of \u201cbased immigrants\u201d, nor that the\nprogressive activists\u2019 small numbers render them irrelevant. Elite opinion is\nwhat really counts for shaping a society\u2019s ideological makeup in the long term\nand these progressive activists are disproportionately represented among those\nwho shape it. Furthermore of course, the more diversity a society has, the\nmore potential grievances there are for the activists to exploit. My point\nrather is that an alternative ruling ideology that accepted a reasonable\ndegree of \u201cnoticing\u201d while proscribing genuine racial discrimination is one\nthat the population at large, whatever their background, would readily accept.\nProgressive activists would revolt, but most of their power is not held\ndirectly but results from their self-appointed role as moral arbiters plus the\nacquiescence of the rest of the population to shaming tactics and social\npressure. The remainder of it comes from DEI bureaucracies which have been\nmade necessary by quite recent legal changes, particularly the 2017 updates to\nthe public sector equality duty in the 2010 Equality Act. If those who head\nour institutions had the courage and ideological justification to simply \u201cjust\nsay no\u201d to woke shaming and those with political power had the will to reverse\nthe legal mechanisms that buttress it, there is little the progressive\nactivists could actually do in response.\n\nAs for what this ideological justification would be, I think that despite the\npotential appearance of naivety, the most plausible option remains Chris\nRufo\u2019s version of colourblind equality coupled with strong and smart political\nwill to enforce this (the link above regarding the Equality Act gives some\nexamples of this in the British context). This policy has the caveat that it\nis a national not international one: there is no obligation to extend\ncolourblind equality to the whole world, otherwise the entire concept of a\nnation becomes meaningless. There also needs to be an acceptance that groups\nare always going to differ on average, which is something that is already\ntacitly understood by most but is currently dangerous to state openly.\nBringing this future about will be a challenge, but it is a necessary one if\nwe don\u2019t want to be prevented from noticing for the rest of our lives and to\nhave to bear the increasing costs of not doing so.\n\nShare\n\n## Enjoying The Critic online?
