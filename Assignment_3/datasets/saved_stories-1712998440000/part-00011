While setting it up and installing\nessentials like Homebrew and Xcode, I also introduced my device to Stable\nDiffusion/Automatic 1111.\n\nHaving Stable Diffusion \u2013 a cutting-edge, open-source software marvel \u2013 ON MY\nLAPTOP feels surreal. It just flys on Apple Silicon too.\n\nMatt Webb\u2018s experiments with GP4 and I have been on my radar and I\u2019ve\ncontemplated employing AI as a creative co-pilot for quite some time. But the\nquestion has always been \u2018what?\u2019\n\nThat \u2018what?\u2019 was answered itself on a recent Zoom call. We were talking about\nhow the distance between Zero and One has shrunk in certain creative areas.\n\nIn the coming years as barriers to entry drop we are going to see an explosion\nin creative work built using game engines. I suspect interactive, single or\nmultiplayer software worlds will almost certainly become the folk art/media of\nthe early 21st century. No creative person will be working on their \u2018novel\u2019,\nthey\u2019ll be making a game.\n\nThe only way to really know just how quickly this near future is coming and\nhow close the distance between Zero and One has become \u2013 is to find out.\n\nPart 2 can be found here\n\n## I\u2019ve Decided To Speed Run Making A Solarpunk Visual Novel\n\nThe plan is to harness Stable Diffusion for the artwork, open-source game\nengine Godot to make the thing, and GPT4 for any coding needs. I already\nchecked and GPT4 assures me that its well-acquainted with Godot\u2019s scripting\nlanguage, GDScript. So we\u2019re good to go.\n\nI aim to reconnect with my younger self\u2014the one who dedicated a summer to\ncrafting a \u2018choose your own adventure\u2019 game using Visual Basic on my first-\never desktop computer back in the late \u201990s\u2014whilst making this game.\n\nI\u2019m not interested in \u2018the thing\u2019 being any \u2018good\u2019, I\u2019m interested in it being\ndone. Plus along the way I will have learnt the basics of everything I would\nneed to know for the next one.\n\nI\u2019m going to keep track of time I spend on this as it\u2019s important. for some\nreason I think I can can get to something \u2018ok-ish\u2019 in about 30 hours. Should\nanyone else join this adventure, they\u2019ll be on the clock as well.\n\nLet\u2019s begin.\n\n## Day 1 \u2013 Morning ~4 hours\n\n### What style?\n\nFirst things first, what art style is the game going to use?\n\nShall I use a base Stable Diffusion 1.5 model and prompt that? Or a custom one\noff civitai.com?\n\nIn the event I end up downloading a bunch of models from Civitai I liked the\nlook of and began by exploring the with some super simple prompts.\n\nShaking the magic 8 ball to see what comes back. Looking for some inspiration.\n\n#### Realistic?\n\n#### Anime?\n\nFor some reason these images remind me of Northern France as you\u2019re driving\ntowards Calais Euro-tunnel?\n\nHow do people look from both the realistic model and the anime one?\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards anime at this point. However I\u2019m not a big fan of the\nbasic near future Solarpunk landscapes it generated above.\n\n#### Manga?\n\nThis looks rad as hell. Also notice, the image and prompt is the same\nbackground/seed as the anime characters on their bikes above. Is nice as this\nstyle looks I\u2019m not sure I want to look at this for hours in a visual novel.\nIt would feel a bit like being inside a barcode.\n\nStill though. Making a mental note that this style is so easily achievable.\n\n#### Semi-Animated?\n\nNow we\u2019re talking!!!\n\nThese images instantly resonated with me \u2013 this is the game I want to play.\nTheses initial images are all a bit wonky and weird, with too many arms and\nhands and weird faces right now, but I like em\u2019.\n\nSo style found! This game is going to be SOOOOO good I know it already. Pre-\nTeen me is absolutely freaking out inside.\n\n### Characters\n\nModel picked, I now need to try and find some \u2018characters\u2019. I also try and\nimprove the level of detail in the images by doing some prompt engineering.\nI\u2019m looking for a chacter design that is striking and recognisable. The sort\nof character you meet when you arrive at a scene in Phoenix Wright or\nwhatever.\n\nSide note \u2013 What the hell kind of image ratio was I using here?\n\nThese initial images look .. a bit.. weird ... right?\n\nWhy do they have that weird Mona Lisa smile? The faces and eyes in particular\nare uncanny mashups of Disney and video games characters?\n\nAlso... this model must have seen so much porn in its time I\u2019m surprised it\u2019s\nnot blind. It just can\u2019t help itself can it?\n\nI give these women some \u2018big hats\u2019 in the prompt to distract from their er ...\nmassive racks. I try to get other things dialled in.\n\nWorking on image fidelity and detail mostly, so I messed with the prompts a\nbit.\n\nI was also trying out some \u2018more details\u2019 and \u2018add details\u2019 LoRA\u2019s I found on\nCivitai\n\nResults are below:\n\nMuch much better! Background details and the characters are much crisper and\nnicer. I like the blend between animated and realism.\n\nThe woman above is something like the character of \u2018Frannie\u2019 from my BSFA long\nlisted Solarpunk short story \u2018In the Storm, A Fire\u2019.\n\nI really need to do something about the \u2018boob\u2019 problem though. It\u2019s a bit out\nof hand. Tabled as a thing to address. Training data bias is a real problem.\n\nFor now though, I want to see just how much detail I can get out of the stack\nof embeddings, LoRA, and textual inversions I\u2019m using on top of the base\nmodel.\n\nHow about some Solarpunk street food vendors trying their best in the climate-\ncamps of a post disaster future?\n\nI decide to use the high-rez latent detail upscaler to see how good the images\ncan get.\n\nI\u2019m having whatever the things the guy on the right is selling. Looks\ndelicious.\n\nEach of these images took around 1m 15secs to pop out of the magic image-\nsynthesis machine I now have installed on my laptop. Just remarkable.\n\nIn 2021 it took over half an hour of waiting in a Google Colab doc to get\nsomething like this:\n\nCybernetic Meadow \u2013 500 iterations CLIP (2021)\n\nWe\u2019ve come so far in such a short amount of time.\n\n## Permanently Moved\n\nPermanently Moved (dot) Online is a weekly podcast 301 seconds in length;\nwritten, recorded and edited by @thejaymo\n\n### Characters in \u2018Places\u2019\n\nI remind myself that \u2018the plan\u2018 is to make a visual novel and I question why\nI\u2019m generating images in portrait? I change the aspect ratio back to landscape\nand start to explore an actual page/place/character/room that could make it\ninto the game.\n\nAt this point I mess with variations of \u2018big tits\u2019 and \u2018massive breasts\u2019 in as\nnegative prompt to see what happens. And important learning here is that\nprompts are essentially as course or as crude as the models training data.\n\u2018Cleavage\u2019 seems to be the best keyword to improve the \u2018boob situation\u2019.\n\nIt is starting to dawn on me that I\u2019m getting a somewhat consistent character\ndesign from the same prompt with different seeds. I have \u2018made a move\u2018 in\nlatent space.\n\nThis is a big success!\n\nLets see what the same prompt as above looks like in high detail with a hire-\nrez fix (both images below have different seeds btw)\n\nLOL @ the cucumbers? marrows? nailed(?) to the wall\n\nI\u2019m really happy with how everything is looking. I do a few more and pick the\nfollowing image as my favourite.\n\nI realise that the in one morning, I\u2019ve generated more images that look like\n\u2018Solarpunk\u2019 to me than probably exist on the internet in total. Having\nAphantasia I don\u2019t really have an idea of what it does look like. Tho I do\nhave opinions.\n\nThis is exactly the vibe I want.\n\nYou arrive at the location in the game and meet this character doing their\nthing. I think this person is a \u2018real character\u2018, the pose, background etc.\nThe fact she\u2019s not looking at the viewer instantly adds a little bit more to\nwhatever story line I might write for her.\n\nNext step is to get as quickly as possible to an animation test. Using in\npainting and batch generation I set stable diffusion to give me images of the\ncharacter with her mouth open\n\nI also in paint her eyebrows and add \u2018surprised\u2019 to the prompt and generate\nanother batch. I string the images together in DaVicnhi resolve and get the\nfollowing:\n\nThis is proof of concept! I can make a game with this. Lessgo!\n\nLastly I wonder, what if I need/want to put the character in a different\nlocation?\n\nFlush with the speaking animation success I generated this new image, and then\nattempt to use in-painting tool to remove the character from the scene.\n\nIt was here I hit my first major roadblock.....\n\nIt\u2019s pretty clear that I have absolutely no fucking idea what I\u2019m doing.\n\nStable-diffusion-art.com\u2018s tutorials and detailed walkthroughs suddenly become\nan invaluable resource and come to the rescue.\n\nWith much farting about I arrive at the following background. Not quite the\nrough and ready market garden we had before, and we\u2019re not in the city limits\nanymore but Solarpunk Tuscany?\n\nA make a quick matte of the original character from the animation gets made in\nAffinity photo.\n\nThen I place her in the image above and re-run it to though SD. It\u2019s only\nafter it generates that i realise that I had selected one of the facial\nexpression images rather than the original \u2013 but I\u2019m feeling thrilled and\nanother thing ticked off the list!\n\nI close out my first 4 hours really pleased with the above images. But the\nmatte making was looong, and in-painting disaster have left me a little\ndeflated.\n\nThinking about the workflow for making and designing other characters, I\nwondered if it would be better to generate characters separately from\nbackgrounds?\n\nOver lunch I watched a few Youtube tutorials on how to get consistent\ncharacters in Stable Diffusion and fall down a daunting rabbit hole of LoRA\ntraining.\n\nI also plug my laptop in to charge as I\u2019d ripped through 16 hours of battery\nlife in just 4. My friend who also has a new M2 Max told me in the pub the\nother day that he has never even heard its fan come on....\n\nI\u2019m right at the edge of compute doing all this stuff is thats for sure.\n\nI\u2019ll cover my afternoon experimenting with generating characters on white\nbackgrounds in the next post.\n\n## Next Post\n\n> Rapid Realms: A Visual Novel with AI | Part 2\n\n## Prefer Email? \ud83d\udce8\n\nSubscribe to receive new posts straight to your inbox!\n\nOr subscribe to my physical mailing list from \u00a35 a month\n\n## Leave a Comment \ud83d\udcac\n\nJay\n\nJay Springett is a Solarpunk and strategist, specialising in the distributed\nweb, metaverse, and world running.
