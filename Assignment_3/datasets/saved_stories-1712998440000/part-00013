An estimated 70% of global CO_2 emissions come from cities, yet few\nurban areas have granular data about where those emissions originate.\n\nIn 2012, Cohen began setting up a Bay Area sensing network that has now grown\nto more than 80 stations, including seven in San Francisco, that stretches\nfrom Sonoma County through Vallejo and down to San Leandro.\n\nBetween 2018 and 2022, 57 of the sensors in the Berkeley Environmental Air\nQuality and CO_2 Network (BEACO_2N) recorded a small but steady decrease in\nCO_2 emissions \u2014 about 1.8% annually \u2014 that translates to a 2.6% yearly drop\nin vehicle emission rates. Looking at California data for electric vehicle\nadoption \u2014 which is very high in the Bay Area \u2014 Cohen and graduate student\nNaomi Asimow concluded that the decrease was due to passenger vehicle\nelectrification.\n\n\"That's 2.6% less CO_2 per mile driven each year,\" said Asimow, who is in the\nDepartment of Earth and Planetary Science.\n\nA map showing the locations of the 57 sensor nodes of the BEACO2N network that\nwere used in this study. The network now consists of more than 80 nodes.\n\nNaomi Asimow and Ronald Cohen, UC Berkeley\n\nThe study, Cohen said, shows the utility of an urban network for monitoring\nand managing federal, state and city mandates for CO_2 reduction.\n\n\"We show from atmospheric measurements that adoption of electric vehicles is\nworking, that it's having the intended effect on CO_2 emissions,\" Cohen said.\n\nThis good news is tempered by the fact that, to meet California and Bay Area\ncarbon reduction goals, the yearly decrease needs to be much greater.\n\n\"The state of California has set this goal for net zero emissions by 2045, and\nthe goal is for 85% of the reduction to come from actual reduction of\nemissions, as opposed to direct removal of CO_2 from the atmosphere. What we\nreport is around half as fast as we need to go to get to net zero emissions by\n2045,\" Asimow said.\n\n\"We're at 1.8% per year today. To get to the state's goal, we would need\n3.7%,\" Cohen added. \"So it's not crazy higher than where we are; we're almost\nhalf of the way to that goal. But we have to sustain that for another 20\nyears.\"\n\nThe results emphasize the urgent need for accelerated actions to reduce CO_2\nin order to achieve the ambitious zero emission targets that cities seek, he\nsaid.\n\nAsimow, Cohen and their colleagues published their findings online April 4 in\nthe journal Environmental Science & Technology.\n\n### Monitoring climate goals\n\nOne impetus for the study was to see whether the BEACO_2N network could detect\nany downward trend in vehicle emissions since the state set goals for\ngreenhouse gas reduction and the electric vehicle market has blossomed.\n\n\"We were curious if our data would show us our progress toward meeting\nCalifornia's emissions goals,\" Asimow said.\n\nUC Berkeley graduate students Naomi Asimow and Milan Patel service a BEACO2N\nnode atop a school roof in eastern Richmond.\n\nKrystyna Koziol\n\nTypically, CO_2 emissions are estimated from known sources of carbon: how much\ngas is used in heating and, for vehicles, the fuel efficiency of registered\nvehicles in an area and overall fuel consumption. Asimow and Cohen noted that\nthis \"bottom-up\" method for estimating carbon dioxide emissions did not\npredict the small but significant downward trend in CO_2 emissions.\n\nThe UC Berkeley team's estimates combined direct CO_2 measurements with\nmeteorological data to calculate ground-level emissions \u2014 an approach using\natmospheric observations that did pick up the modest downturn in CO_2 levels.\nThe researchers employed a Bayesian statistical analysis that started with\nestimates based on economic data, but they revised them based on their\nnetwork's measured CO_2 concentrations and a meteorological model to predict\nwhere the emissions originated.\n\nCohen argues that his sensors are inexpensive enough \u2014 less than $10,000 per\nsensor, versus 20 times as much for pollution monitoring stations operated by\nthe Environmental Protection Agency \u2014 that major cities could afford to\ninstall a network to get a more granular view of unhealthy areas and sources\nof pollution. The network sensors also measure five critical air pollutants:\ncarbon monoxide, nitrous oxides (NO and NO_2), ozone and particulates (PM\n2.5).\n\nLos Angeles, California; Providence, Rhode Island; and Glasgow, Scotland, have\nalready adopted Cohen's sensors to create their own pollution monitoring\nnetworks.\n\nA BEACO2N node, consisting of a CO2 sensor and an air quality monitor, atop\nthe Exploratorium, an innovative science museum in San Francisco.

One of our goals is to\ndemonstrate, both on the CO_2 and the air quality side of what we do, that\nthis is cost-effective and translatable and easily accessible to the public in\na way that nothing else is.\"\n\nIn the future, satellites could monitor carbon dioxide levels across wide\nareas and with more granularity, but those satellites are not yet available,\nCohen said.\n\n\"The optimal solution will be some combination of space-based assets and\nground-based measurements,\" he said.\n\nAsimow was supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research\nFellowship (1752814).
