And they will often choose multi-\nalignment, a strategy that will make them critical\u2014and sometimes\nunpredictable\u2014forces in the world\u2019s next stage of globalization, and the next\nphase of great power competition.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the 2020s, everything is geopolitical. It took a global pandemic, Russia\u2019s\nwar on Ukraine, and heightened U.S.-China competition for the fact that the\nold era of globalization is over to become undeniable. Each great power has a\nprivileged position in the global economy, and they all face new risks and\nuncertain futures. The United States is leaning more into its status as the\nholder of the world\u2019s reserve currency, using the dollar and related payment\nsystems to sanction adversaries and competitors. China is leveraging\ndependency on its position in supply chains. And Russia\u2014with nowhere near the\npower of China or the U.S., but with more appetite for risk\u2014has wielded energy\nto intimidate and coerce its neighbors and limit global support for Ukraine.\nThere is no country or multilateral organization that has the capacity to\narbitrate these tensions.\n\nBut this unstable geopolitical reality doesn\u2019t mean that other countries or\norganizations are helpless, waiting for the dust to settle around the\ngeopolitical victor\u2014the old Cold War this is not, even if some of the patterns\nseem eerily reminiscent. When the U.S. and USSR were locked for four decades\nin what George Orwell described as \u201ca peace that is no peace,\u201d the rest of the\nworld had three options. Countries could join the U.S.\u2019s alliance system or\nsphere of influence, they could join the Communist bloc, or they could attempt\nto remain non-aligned.\n\nThe world is more connected today than it was during the Cold War, and the\npace of events is accelerating. Non-alignment is more challenging both in\ntheory and in practice. As the U.S. and China coexist, compete, and confront\neach other to determine who will set the geopolitical rules, they will either\ncourt or thwart an emerging group of countries to gain an edge. This new class\nof influential nations are the geopolitical swing states of the 21st century.\n\nIn American domestic politics, swing states can be won by either party, and\nthey decide presidential elections. In geopolitics, swing states have agency\nto chart their own course on an issue-by-issue basis, and they may decide the\nfuture of the international balance of power. They are relatively stable\ncountries that have their own global agendas independent of Washington and\nBeijing, and the will and capabilities to turn those agendas into realities.\nThey are growing more assertive in using their economic advantages to bolster\ntheir standing and influence. They are more demanding, flexible, dynamic, and\nstrategic than they could have been in the 20th century, whatever their shared\ninterests with one great power or another. And they will often choose multi-\nalignment, a strategy that will make them critical\u2014and sometimes\nunpredictable\u2014forces in the world\u2019s next stage of globalization, and the next\nphase of great power competition.\n\nThe era of multi-alignment\n\nRussia\u2019s unprovoked and brutal war in Ukraine is a turning point that\ndemonstrates the importance of democratic alliance systems and supporting\nsovereignty and territorial integrity. As the Center for a New American\nSecurity\u2019s Richard Fontaine argued, \u201c[Putin\u2019s] war could ultimately leave NATO\nlarger, more unified, better armed and with military deployments placed closer\nto Russia ... A land war on the continent may well have helped to birth a new\nEurope.\u201d Coupled with the announcement of Russia\u2019s \u201cno-limits partnership\u201d\nwith China, the war may have also given renewed purpose to the transatlantic\nalliance. But the majority of the world\u2019s population still lives in countries\nthat remain officially neutral, even if they condemned Russia\u2019s invasion. The\nbattle lines in Ukraine. and what\u2019s happened since February 24, 2022, have\ncast the era of multi-alignment into stark relief.\n\nIndia, which currently holds the G20 presidency, stands out as the\nparadigmatic example of a country with a newly influential and complex\ngeopolitical role. New Delhi\u2019s Minister of External Affairs, Subrahmanyam\nJaishankar, has said that we are witnessing the end of a \u201cworld order which is\nstill very, very deeply Western,\u201d and the rise of an era in which countries\nlike his will pursue their own \u201cparticular policies and preferences and\ninterests.\u201d Jaishankar\u2019s contention that Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine is ushering\nin the end of a Western-led international system is up for debate. But his\npoint that swing states like India have a great degree of autonomy\u2014even more\nso than they did as non-aligned countries during the Cold War\u2014is correct.\nIndia has many structural advantages and many vulnerabilities, including its\nlow literacy and labor-force participation rates, particularly for women. But\nit is now the most populous country in the world, and it has a relatively\nyoung population. Its GDP is still one-sixth that of China\u2019s, but with the\nright industrialization policies and infrastructure, its economy could double\nin size by 2030, making it the third-largest on the planet. As India continues\nits economic rise, its exclusion from the G7 will only become more\nanachronistic.\n\nWhile New Delhi is moving closer to the West through partnerships like the\nQuad and new technology and defense agreements with the United States, it is\nnot in one bloc or another. Jaishankar responded to Russia\u2019s invasion by\nstating that \u201cEurope has to grow out of the mindset that Europe\u2019s problems are\nthe world\u2019s problems but the world\u2019s problems are not Europe\u2019s.\u201d And despite\nWestern sanctions against Russia, India has increased its imports from Russia\nby almost 400 percent, much of that in the form of crude oil purchased at a\ndiscount.\n\nIndia has the capacity for multi-alignment not only because of its own\nactions, but also because of the broader geopolitical environment. For\ngeopolitical swing states to pursue their preferences requires that the\nworld\u2019s two preeminent geopolitical powers\u2014the U.S. and China\u2014don\u2019t let their\nbilateral relationship devolve into all-out war, shifting geopolitical\ndecisions from ones of preferences to ones of survival.\n\nDualistic frameworks like \u201cdemocracies versus autocracies\u201d do not have\nsufficient explanatory power for today\u2019s more complicated, multi-aligned\nworld. President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen recently\nspoke about the importance of \u201cde-risking,\u201d if not \u201cdecoupling\u201d Europe\u2019s\neconomy from China\u2019s\u2014language that U.S. National Security Advisor Jake\nSullivan has since echoed. However, a few days after Von Der Leyen\u2019s remarks,\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, accompanied by a significant business\ndelegation in Beijing, struck a different tone, arguing that Europe must\n\u201creduce its dependency on the U.S. and avoid getting dragged into a\nconfrontation between China and the U.S. over Taiwan.\u201d Going further, Brazil\u2019s\nLuiz Ignacio Lula da Silva headed to China in recent weeks, accompanied by 240\nbusiness leaders, and said he wonders \u201cevery night ... why all countries have\nto base their trade on the dollar.\u201d\n\nWhile appeals to democratic values resonate in many Western capitals and\nliberal societies, they do not always in countries that are critical partners\nfor the U.S. and its allies in today\u2019s global competition. For example, though\nIndia is the world\u2019s most populous democracy, it trades and engages with\nautocracies like Russia, which provides a significant portion of New Delhi\u2019s\narms imports. Singapore was excluded from the U.S. State Department\u2019s Summit\nfor Democracy and remains deeply connected to China, yet joined the countries\nleveling financial sanctions against Russia for invading Ukraine. Vietnam is a\ncritical U.S. partner in ASEAN, but China is its top trading destination. The\nenergy giants of the GCC are navigating a delicate balancing act as key\npartners of China, Russia, and the United States. The list goes on.\n\nThe rise of the geopolitical swing state\n\nGeopolitical swing states are critical to the world economy and balance of\npower, but they don\u2019t have the capacity by themselves to drive the global\nagenda, at least for now. However, as long as the tensions between the U.S.\nand China continue to get worse, they will have outsized abilities to navigate\ngeopolitical competition and take advantage of and influence it. They know\nthis and are consciously using that newfound power to shape the world order to\nmore effectively serve their national objectives.\n\nThese countries fall into four often overlapping categories.\n\n1\\. Countries with a competitive advantage in a critical aspect of global\nsupply chains.\n\nCountries that can command control of critical components of the world\u2019s\nsupply chains have significant economic advantages. For example, India\u2019s large\nlabor and consumer markets, edge in pharmaceuticals, digital connectivity, and\nproduction-linked incentives like \u201cMake in India\u201d position it to be the next\nglobal manufacturing hub. New Delhi is also working with partners like\nAustralia to increase supply chain resilience, with an eye toward economic\nthreats from China. Small countries with advanced semiconductor industries,\nsuch as Taiwan, manufacturer of the world\u2019s most advanced semiconductors, and\nThe Netherlands, with companies like ASML, also hold outsized influence.\n\nSupply chain advantages aren\u2019t just about manufacturing. Brazil, Latin\nAmerica\u2019s largest economy, leads in commodities and agriculture and is growing\nits service sector. Bangladesh\u2019s textile industry fuels large portions of the\nworld\u2019s fast fashion industry. Morocco has 70% of the world\u2019s phosphate\nreserves and is a critical bridge between the Arab and African worlds. As the\nU.S. and its allies and partners aim to disrupt China\u2019s dominance of critical\nsupply chains, including rare earths, countries like Australia, Canada,\nSweden, and Japan will become more important. Indonesia, as a member of the\nG-20, will benefit from being home to 22 percent of the world\u2019s nickel\nreserves, making it a hub for critical minerals necessary for the production\nof electric vehicles. So too will Chile, which has 26 percent of the world\u2019s\nlithium reserves.\n\nThe presence of critical natural resources is often necessary, but can be\ninsufficient to make a country a geopolitical swing state. The Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo (DRC) has the world\u2019s largest deposits of cobalt, a\nvital component of everything from electric vehicles to batteries. However,\ndue to conflicts, humanitarian crises and abuses, and a long-standing track\nrecord of corruption, the DRC has little hope of achieving its full potential\non the geopolitical stage in the medium term. Meanwhile, Chinese firms have\npositioned themselves to benefit as they extract the country\u2019s productive\ncobalt reserves.\n\nHowever, when countries are well-positioned to take advantage of their natural\nresources, they can achieve newfound geopolitical importance. No American\npresident has ever been to Guyana. But the small South American nation\nrecently found commercially recoverable petroleum reserves of up to 11 billion\nbarrels, positioning it as a global player in energy markets, raising the\nstandard of living of the Guyanese people, and offering it future potential to\none day become the next geopolitical swing state at a critical time. Last\nfall, the Biden administration reluctantly turned to Venezuela for new sources\nof energy but with the right long-term policies, it could be Guyana that\nshifts the politics of energy in Latin America and offers the U.S. a new, and\npreferred, alternative. Guyana could attract the investment required to make\nit a player in global energy markets, if it can transparently implement a\nsound policy framework for how the revenues will be spent.\n\n2\\. Countries with a unique ability to make themselves attractive for\nnearshoring, offshoring, or friendshoring.\n\nThe second category of geopolitical swing states benefit from relationships\nand locations that position them to capitalize on current trends toward\nnearshoring, offshoring and friendshoring, as global supply chains move to a\nmore geopolitically stable footing. In the Indo-Pacific, Vietnam\u2014which last\nyear replaced the United Kingdom as the United States\u2019 seventh-largest trading\npartner\u2014will benefit, especially if it can train a new generation of skilled\nengineers and business leaders who can optimize its strong labor supply and\nmake it a more attractive alternative for shipping and manufacturing. In the\nWestern Hemisphere, an emphasis on friendshoring and nearshoring will benefit\nMexico, Canada, and several Latin American countries, which can offer\nalternative manufacturing hubs with lower labor costs and lower transportation\nexpenses to markets in the United States. Nearshoring could turn Made in\nAmerica policies into Made in the Americas policies, and industrial\ninitiatives like the Inflation Reduction Act could shift the rare earths\nsupply chain from offshoring to friendshoring by offering miners in countries\nwith US free trade agreements, like USMCA, credits of 10 percent of production\ncosts.\n\n3\\. Countries with a disproportionate amount of capital and willingness to\ndeploy it around the world in pursuit of strategic objectives.\n\nHigh energy prices in recent years have given the Gulf Cooperation Council\n(GCC) countries significant opportunities, and the GCC\u2019s total wealth is\nexpected to rise from $2.7 trillion to $3.5 trillion by 2026. These countries\nhave emerged from an era in the Middle East dominated by the Global War on\nTerror with their long-standing power through OPEC+ intact. For decades, they\nhave struggled with the fact that geopolitics drove their economic interests;\nnow many are putting economics at the center of their geopolitical\nconsiderations. While the Middle East remains a challenging neighborhood, the\nGCC countries have the opportunity to reintroduce themselves to the world as\nproductive partners, not just as places for resource extraction or sources of\ncapital.\n\nPart of their strategy is to go big at home\u2014giga projects like Neom in Saudi\nArabia, the World Cup in Qatar, and creating a business nerve center in UAE\nare allowing them to differentiate themselves and attracting investments and\ntalent. A second part of their strategy is to deploy capital abroad in ways\nthat diversify their geographic touch points and calibrate with their\nexpertise. The UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are all actively investing\nin myriad locales from Latin America to Southeast Asia, India and Africa.\n\nAnother country that has benefited from high energy prices is Norway, a nation\nof 5.4 million people with a sovereign wealth fund that holds over $1.4\ntrillion in assets. Historically a neutral country, a member of NATO, but not\nthe European Union, Norway has the opportunity to advance an economic agenda\nwith relatively few worries about geopolitical entanglements. Prioritizing the\nfight against climate change, it has announced the goal to have every company\nin its portfolio reach net-zero emissions by 2050. Meanwhile, it will have\neven greater sway as the North Sea realizes its potential as a wind-power-\nproduction hub. Likewise Singapore, a global financial hub and tremendous\nbeneficiary of the age of hyper-globalization, is positioning by combining\nsocial planning and highly effective investments in human capital with the\nenormous wealth created in Asia over recent decades.\n\n4\\. Countries with developed economies and leaders who have global visions\nthat they pursue within certain constraints.\n\nThe fourth category of geopolitical swing states includes developed economies\nwhose leaders have global visions and are establishing their own positions on\ncontentious geopolitical issues. Germany, a NATO ally and pillar of the rules-\nbased international order, has phased out its reliance on Russian energy\nimports and is providing lethal aid to Ukraine\u2014a historic turning point in its\npost-Cold War foreign policy. But it, too, is pursuing a form of multi-\nalignment, making engagement with China a top priority in a way that serves as\na model for other members of the European Union. German Chancellor Olaf\nScholz\u2019s brief October visit to Beijing was the first by a G7 leader since the\nonset of the Covid-19 pandemic. President Macron advocates \u201cstrategic\nautonomy,\u201d and Paris has its eyes on Chinese consumers and manufacturing\nmarkets. France has made no secret of its desire to chart a middle path on\ntechnology and much else.\n\nThe pattern is different in East Asia. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol\nhas declared his country a global \u201cpivotal state,\u201d recalling the work of Paul\nKennedy and his co-authors, who in 1996 drew on British geographer Halford\nMackinder to describe \u201cpivotal states\u201d as \u201chot spot[s] that could determine\nnot only the fate of [their] region[s] but also affect international\nstability.\u201d President Yoon\u2019s strengthening ties with Prime Minister Fumio\nKishida\u2019s Japan\u2014which is doubling defense spending as a percent of GDP\u2014is a\nhistoric realignment that may cause discontent for Yoon at home, but also\ntempers what has been a burdensome political and economic distraction for both\nSeoul and Tokyo.\n\nThere is significant overlap among the categories of geopolitical swing\nstates. Saudi Arabia, for example, has a strategic geographic position, oil\nreserves, and significant capital to deploy globally. There\u2019s a reason China\nwent to such lengths to broker the recent restart of Saudi-Iran diplomatic\nrelations, beyond its own immediate interest; Beijing recognized that a swing\nstate like Saudi Arabia will have even more geopolitical relevance to China\u2019s\nown ambitions going forward. Saudi Arabia demonstrates how each geopolitical\nswing state has its own comparative advantages, and our current geopolitical\nmoment is prompting them to use these advantages like never before. That has\nramifications not just for the ways countries act individually, but how they\nact in concert as well.\n\nNew models of cooperation\n\nThe great powers are not the only players that matter in today\u2019s great power\ncompetition. Geopolitical swing states are taking on new prominence, and their\nimportance will lead to new forms of international cooperation. The additions\nof Finland and Sweden to NATO this year are pushing its geographic focus north\nand east, at the same time that Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has given the\nCold War-era alliance a renewed sense of purpose. But some of the most\ninteresting international cooperation may not take place at legacy\nmultilateral bodies, but through new, more flexible coalitions adapted for\nchanged realities.\n\nThe Quad and AUKUS are new models of security cooperation in the Indo-Pacific,\nalthough the latter rattled the transatlantic relationship between the U.S.\nand France. Mutual security concerns will drive additional cooperation, as\nwe\u2019ve seen recently with NATO\u2019s new liaison office in Tokyo. The U.S.-Mexico-\nCanada Agreement, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the\nComprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, and the\nIndo-Pacific Economic Framework all show that even in an age of populism and\nprotectionism, there\u2019s great appetite for trade agreements. Even policies like\nthe U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, which created consternation in European\ncapitals, could galvanize the creation of new trade and investment\narchitectures on green technologies.\n\nBut the most interesting new frontier of international cooperation is\ntechnology, where capability alliances will become more important. There\u2019s a\ncritical gap in democratic cooperation on technology issues, on everything\nfrom standards-setting to investment, in part because of protectionism, and\nalso because the U.S. has a difficult time determining which countries to\ninclude and exclude. Many, sometimes ad hoc organizations have formed in\nrecent years to fill this gap. The Quad has launched a Critical and Emerging\nTechnologies working group, and the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council\nfocuses democratic cooperation on issues like standards and investment. The\nso-called Chip 4 group\u2014the United States, South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan\u2014has\nnot yet become a true partnership, but together with the Netherlands these\ncountries control a significant portion of the world\u2019s supply of semiconductor\ndesign and production. Further up the supply chain, the United States has\nlaunched a Mineral Security Partnership focused on the clean-tech revolution.\nBut on issues like artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and\nbiotechnology, an overarching forum of like-minded countries is still needed\nto consolidate leadership and align priorities. Such a forum could also focus\non data\u2019s central role in global trade, perhaps building on the late Prime\nMinister Shinzo Abe of Japan\u2019s model of Data Free Flow with Trust, the\nprinciples of which were endorsed in arrangements like the Japan-U.S. Digital\nTrade Agreement and the Japan-UK Economic Partnership Agreement.\n\nThe most effective alliances will be those that are able to best harness\ntechnology to integrate military capabilities first, followed by economic\nlevers.\n\nNo return to business as usual\n\nThe rise of geopolitical swing states may balance the great powers and help\nstabilize the global order. Their interest-based decision-making could be a\nsource of consistency in uncertain times. Or their newfound prominence may\nincrease global instability by putting more actors and variables in play. But\neven if today\u2019s world is not yet multipolar, a rising group of countries\nrecognize that they can determine the course of world events. Those\ngeopolitical swing states are aware that their power may be unsustainable, or\neven fleeting, and they are determined to take advantage of the current window\nof opportunity.\n\nThe great powers should take note. So should multinational businesses, which\nincreasingly find themselves in the geopolitical crosshairs. These companies\nare struggling to parse macro trends, searching for investment sources and\ndestinations to deliver the most effective returns on their capital, and.\nlooking for ways to build more resilience into their supply chains. There are\nsignificant opportunities for U.S.-based companies to invest at home, and for\ninternational businesses to invest in America. The American economy remains\nthe largest and one of the most dynamic and productive in the world, and these\ncompanies owe much of their success to the security, rule of law, and educated\nworkforce that the United States and its form of government make possible.\nMany of these businesses\u2014especially technology companies and those critical to\nglobal supply chains\u2014are now recognizing their importance as national-security\nstakeholders in their own right.\n\nBut to rise to this occasion, companies also need to recognize the importance\nof geopolitical swing states, both now and in the future. Tracking the way\nswing states navigate our current global order will give businesses a good\nreference point to calibrate their own actions in response to Washington and\nBeijing (and to a lesser extent, Moscow). It will also reveal new and\ninteresting investment theses, like the rise of GCC countries as a major\nsource of investment capital across the world, and give them insight into how\nother businesses are reorienting their supply chains toward countries that can\nplay multiple sides in international conflicts.\n\nIdentifying and embracing the opportunities in global geopolitics is a\nnecessity in today\u2019s economic environment. It will be a sustainable\ncompetitive advantage for businesses going forward; the most effective\nbusiness leaders will be those who work relentlessly to understand how changes\nin the geopolitical landscape create new risks and present new business\nopportunities.\n\nFor years, geopolitics mattered more to certain industries than others. Now\nthey matter to everyone. The best bet for businesses just now waking up to\nthis reality is to learn from the experiences and strategies of these newly\npowerful swing states.\n\nThe information provided in this article is for informational purposes only\nand does not constitute a recommendation from any Goldman Sachs entity to the\nrecipient.
