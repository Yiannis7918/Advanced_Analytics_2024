Human civilization, the proposal explained, had begun with\nhunter-gatherers, passed through the agrarian and industrial stages, and was\nfast approaching the end of the information age. As then Prime Minister Shinzo\nAbe put it, \u201cWe are now witnessing the opening of the fifth chapter.\u201d\n\nThis chapter, called Society 5.0, would see made-on-demand goods and robot\ncaretakers, taxis, and tractors. Many of the innovations that will enable it,\nlike artificial intelligence, might be obvious. But there is one key\ntechnology that is easy to overlook: lasers.\n\nThe lasers of Society 5.0 will need to meet several criteria. They must be\nsmall enough to fit inside everyday devices. They must be low-cost so that the\naverage metalworker or car buyer can afford them\u2014which means they must also be\nsimple to manufacture and use energy efficiently. And because this dawning era\nwill be about mass customization (rather than mass production), they must be\nhighly controllable and adaptive.\n\nSemiconductor lasers would seem the perfect candidates, except for one fatal\nflaw: They are much too dim. Laser brightness\u2014defined as optical power per\nunit area per unit of solid angle\u2014is a measure of how intensely light can be\nfocused as it exits the laser and how narrowly it diverges as it moves away.\nThe threshold for materials work\u2014cutting, welding, drilling\u2014is on the order of\n1 gigawatt per square centimeter per steradian (GW/cm^2/sr). However, the\nbrightness of even the brightest commercial semiconductor lasers falls far\nbelow that.\n\nBrightness is also important for light detection and ranging (lidar) systems\nin autonomous robots and vehicles. These systems don\u2019t require metal-melting\npower, but to make precise measurements from long distances or at high speeds,\nthey do require tightly focused beams. Today\u2019s top-line lidar systems employ\nmore than 100 semiconductor lasers whose inherently divergent beams are\ncollimated using a complicated setup of lenses installed by hand. This\ncomplexity drives up cost, putting lidar-navigated cars out of reach for most\nconsumers.\n\nMultiple 3-millimeter-wide photonic-crystal semiconductor lasers are built on\na semiconductor wafer. Susumu Noda\n\nOf course, other types of lasers can produce ultrabright beams. Carbon dioxide\nand fiber lasers, for instance, dominate the market for industrial\napplications. But compared to speck-size semiconductor lasers, they are\nenormous. A high-power CO_2 laser can be as large as a refrigerator. They are\nalso more expensive, less energy efficient, and harder to control.\n\nOver the past couple of decades, our team at Kyoto University has been\ndeveloping a new type of semiconductor laser that blows through the brightness\nceiling of its conventional cousins. We call it the photonic-crystal surface-\nemitting laser, or PCSEL (pronounced \u201cpick-cell\u201d). Most recently, we\nfabricated a PCSEL that can be as bright as gas and fiber lasers\u2014bright enough\nto quickly slice through steel\u2014and proposed a design for one that is 10 to 100\ntimes as bright. Such devices could revolutionize the manufacturing and\nautomotive industries. If we, our collaborating companies, and research groups\naround the world\u2014such as at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, in\nHsinchu, Taiwan; the University of Texas at Arlington; and the University of\nGlasgow\u2014can push PCSEL brightness further still, it would even open the door\nto exotic applications like inertial-confinement nuclear fusion and light\npropulsion for spaceflight.\n\n## Hole-y Grail\n\nThe magic of PCSELs arises from their unique construction. Like any\nsemiconductor laser, a PCSEL consists of a thin layer of light-generating\nmaterial, known as the active layer, sandwiched between cladding layers. In\nfact, for the sake of orientation, it\u2019s helpful to picture the device as a\nliteral sandwich\u2014let\u2019s say a slice of ham between two pieces of bread.\n\nNow imagine lifting the sandwich to your mouth, as if you are about to take a\nbite. If your sandwich were a conventional semiconductor laser, its beam would\nradiate from the far edge, away from you. This beam is created by passing a\ncurrent through a stripe in the active \u201cham\u201d layer. The excited ham atoms\nspontaneously release photons, which stimulate the release of identical\nphotons, amplifying the light. Mirrors on each end of the stripe then\nrepeatedly reflect these waves; because of interference and loss, only certain\nfrequencies and spatial patterns\u2014or modes\u2014are sustained. When the gain of a\nmode exceeds losses, the light emerges in a coherent beam, and the laser is\nsaid to oscillate in that mode.\n\nThe problem with this standard stripe approach is that it is very difficult to\nincrease output power without sacrificing beam quality. The power of a\nsemiconductor laser is limited by its emission area because extremely\nconcentrated light can cause catastrophic damage to the semiconductor. You can\ndeliver more power by widening the stripe, which is the strategy used for so-\ncalled broad-area lasers. But a wider stripe also gives room for the\noscillating light to take zigzag sideways paths, forming what are called\nhigher-order lateral modes.\n\n### More Modes, More Problems\n\nA conventional semiconductor laser emits light from the front edge of its\nactive stripe. Output power can be increased by widening the stripe, but this\nalso gives room for light to oscillate along zigzag paths. These so-called\nhigher-order lateral modes cause the beam to become spotty and divergent,\nlimiting laser brightness to about 100 megawatts per square centimeter per\nsteradian.\n\nMark Montgomery\n\nYou can visualize the intesity pattern of a lateral mode by imagining that\nyou\u2019ve placed a screen in the cross section of the output beam. Light bouncing\nback and forth perfectly along the length of the stripe forms the fundamental\n(zero-order) mode, which has a single peak of intensity in the center of the\nbeam. The first-order mode, from light reflecting at an angle to the edge of\nthe sandwich, has two peaks to the right and left; the second-order mode, from\na smaller angle, has a row of three peaks, and so on. For each higher-order\nmode, the laser effectively operates as a combination of smaller emitters\nwhose narrower apertures cause the beam to diverge rapidly. The resulting\nmixture of lateral modes therefore makes the laser light spotty and diffuse.\n\nThose troublesome modes are why the brightness of conventional semiconductor\nlasers maxes out around 100 MW/cm^2/sr. PCSELs deal with unwanted modes by\nadding another layer inside the sandwich: the \u201cSwiss cheese\u201d layer. This\nspecial extra layer is a semiconductor sheet stamped with a two-dimensional\narray of nanoscale holes. By tuning the spacing and shape of the holes, we can\ncontrol the propagation of light inside the laser so that it oscillates in\nonly the fundamental mode, even when the emission area is expanded. The result\nis a beam that can be both powerful and narrow\u2014that is, bright.\n\nBecause of their internal physics, PCSELs operate in a completely different\nway from edge-emitting lasers. Instead of pointing away from you, for\ninstance, the beam from your PCSEL sandwich would now radiate upward, through\nthe top slice of bread. To explain this unusual emission, and why PCSELs can\nbe orders of magnitude brighter than other semiconductor lasers, we must first\ndescribe the material properties of the Swiss cheese\u2014in actuality, a\nfascinating structure called a photonic crystal.\n\n## How Photonic Crystals Work\n\nPhotonic crystals control the flow of light in a way that\u2019s similar to how\nsemiconductors control the flow of electrons. Instead of atoms, however, the\nlattice of a photonic crystal is sculpted out of larger entities\u2014such as\nholes, cubes, or columns\u2014arranged such that the refractive index changes\nperiodically on the scale of a wavelength of light. Although the quest to\nartificially construct these marvelous materials began less than 40 years ago,\nscientists have since learned that they already exist in nature. Opals,\npeacock feathers, and some butterfly wings, for example, all owe their\nbrilliant iridescence to the intricate play of light within naturally\nengineered photonic crystals.\n\nUnderstanding how light moves in a photonic crystal is fundamental to PCSEL\ndesign. We can predict this behavior by studying the crystal\u2019s photonic band\nstructure, which is analogous to the electronic band structure of a\nsemiconductor. One way to do that is to plot the relationship between\nfrequency and wavenumber\u2014the number of wave cycles that fit within one unit\ncell of the crystal\u2019s lattice.\n\n### How Light Moves in a Photonic Crystal\n\nAt certain wavelengths determined by the groove spacing, light refracts\nthrough and partially reflects off each interface. The overlapping reflections\ncombine to form a standing wave that does not travel through the crystal.\n\nIn a square lattice such as that used in PCSELs, air holes bend light backward\nand sideways. The combination of multiple such diffractions creates a 2D\nstanding wave. In a PCSEL, only this wave is amplified in the active layer,\ncreating a laser beam of a single wavelength.\n\nMark Montgomery\n\nConsider, for example, a simple one-dimensional photonic crystal formed by\nalternating ribbons of glass and air. Light entering the crystal will refract\nthrough and partially reflect off each interface, producing overlapping beams\nthat reinforce or weaken one another according to the light\u2019s wavelength and\ndirection. Most waves will travel through the material. But at certain points,\ncalled singularity points, the reflections combine perfectly with the incident\nwave to form a standing wave, which does not propagate. In this case, a\nsingularity occurs when a wave undergoes exactly half a cycle from one air\nribbon to the next. There are other singularities wherever a unit cell is an\ninteger multiple of half the wavelength.\n\nOne of us (Susumu Noda) began experimenting with lasers containing photonic\ncrystal-like structures before these materials even had a name. In the mid\n1980s, while at Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, he studied a semiconductor\nlaser called a distributed feedback (DFB) laser. A DFB laser is a basic stripe\nlaser with an extra internal layer containing regularly spaced grooves filled\nwith matter of a slightly different refractive index. This periodic structure\nbehaves somewhat like the 1D photonic crystal described above: It repeatedly\nreflects light at a single wavelength, as determined by the groove spacing,\nsuch that a standing wave emerges. Consequently, the laser oscillates at only\nthat wavelength, which is critical for long-haul fiber-optic transmission and\nhigh-sensitivity optical sensing.\n\n### Steel Slicer\n\nA 3-millimeter PCSEL rivals the brightness of gas and fiber lasers, thanks to\nits photonic-crystal layer. This 2D array of nanoscale holes manipulates light\ninside the laser to generate a surface beam that is both powerful and narrow.\n\nMark Montgomery\n\nAs the Mitsubishi team demonstrated, a DFB laser can be enticed to perform\nother tricks. For instance, when the team set the groove spacing equal to the\nlasing wavelength in the device, some of the oscillating light diffracted\nupward, causing the laser to shine not only from the tiny front edge of its\nactive stripe but also from the stripe\u2019s top. However, this surface beam\nfanned wildly due to the narrow width of the stripe, which also made it\ndifficult to increase the output power.\n\nTo Noda\u2019s disappointment, his team\u2019s attempts to widen the stripe\u2014and\ntherefore increase brightness\u2014without causing other headaches were\nunsuccessful. Nevertheless, those early failures planted an intriguing idea:\nWhat if laser light could be controlled in two dimensions instead of one?\n\n## Boosting Brightness\n\nLater, at Kyoto University, Noda led research into 2D and 3D photonic crystals\njust as the field was coming into being. In 1998, his team built the first\nPCSEL, and we have since honed the design for various functionalities,\nincluding high brightness.\n\nIn a basic PCSEL, the photonic-crystal layer is a 2D square lattice: Each unit\ncell is a square delineated by four holes. Although the band structure of a 2D\nphotonic crystal is more complicated than that of a 1D crystal, it likewise\nreveals singularities where we expect standing waves to form. For our devices,\nwe have made use of the singularity that occurs when the distance between\nneighboring holes is one wavelength. A gallium arsenide laser operating at 940\nnanometers, for example, has an internal wavelength of around 280 nm\n(considering refractive index and temperature). So the holes in a basic\ngallium arsenide PCSEL would be set about 280 nm apart.\n\nThe operating principle is this: When waves of that length are generated in\nthe active layer, the holes in the neighboring photonic-crystal layer act like\ntiny mirrors, bending the light both backward and sideways. The combined\neffect of multiple such diffractions creates a 2D standing wave, which is then\namplified by the active layer. Some of this oscillating light also diffracts\nupward and downward and leaks out the laser\u2019s top, producing a surface beam of\na single wavelength.\n\nA key reason this design works is the large refractive index contrast between\nthe semiconductor and the air inside the holes. As Noda discovered while\ncreating the first device, PCSELs with low refractive index contrasts, like\nthose of DFB lasers, do not oscillate coherently. Also unlike a DFB laser, a\nPCSEL\u2019s surface emission area is broad and usually round. It can therefore\nproduce a higher quality beam with much lower divergence.\n\n### Bigger and Brighter\n\nAs PCSEL size grows to accommodate more optical power, more lateral modes\nbegin to oscillate. Here\u2019s how those modes are eliminated in each device\ngeneration.\n\nMark Montgomery\n\nHigher-order lateral modes form when a standing wave has multiple average\npeaks of intensity. When the emission area of the PCSEL is relatively small,\nthe peaks sit near its edge. Consequently, most of the light leaks out of the\nsides, and so the higher-order modes do not oscillate.\n\nThe double lattice causes light diffracting through the crystal to interfere\ndestructively. These cancellations weaken and spread the intensity peaks of\nthe standing waves, causing the higher-order modes to leak heavily again.\nHowever, this method alone does not sufficiently suppress those modes in\nlarger devices.\n\nAdjustments to the holes and the bottom reflector induce light exiting the\nlaser to lose some of its energy through interference with the standing waves.\nBecause higher-order modes lose more light, they can be selectively cut off.\n\nIn 2014, our group reported that a PCSEL with a square lattice of triangular\nholes and an emission area of 200 by 200 \u03bcm could operate continuously at\naround 1 watt while maintaining a spotlike beam that diverged only about 2\ndegrees. Compared with conventional semiconductor lasers, whose beams\ntypically diverge more than 30 degrees, this performance was remarkable. The\nnext step was to boost optical power, for which we needed a larger device. But\nhere we hit a snag.\n\nAccording to our theoretical models, PCSELs using the single-lattice design\ncould not grow larger than about 200 \u03bcm without inviting pesky higher-order\nlateral modes. In a PCSEL, multiple modes form when the intensity of a\nstanding wave can be distributed in multiple ways due to the interference\npattern created by repeated diffractions. In the fundamental (read: desirable)\nmode, the intensity distribution resembles Mount Fuji, with most of the\noscillating light concentrated in the center of the lattice. Each higher-order\nmode, meanwhile, has two, three, four, or more Mount Fujis. So when the\nlaser\u2019s emission area is relatively small, the intensity peaks of the higher-\norder modes sit near the lattice\u2019s periphery. Most of their light therefore\nleaks out of the sides of the device, preventing these modes from oscillating\nand contributing to the laser beam. But as with conventional lasers, enlarging\nthe emission area makes space for more modes to oscillate.\n\nTo solve that problem, we added another set of holes to the photonic-crystal\nlayer, creating a double lattice. In our most successful version, a square\nlattice of circular holes is shifted a quarter wavelength from a second square\nlattice of elliptical holes. As a result, some of the diffracting light inside\nthe crystal interferes destructively. These cancellations cause the intensity\npeaks of the lateral modes to weaken and spread. So when we expand the laser\u2019s\nemission area, light from the higher-order modes still leaks heavily and does\nnot oscillate.\n\nUsing that approach, we fabricated a PCSEL with a round emission area 1\nmillimeter in diameter and showed it could produce a 10-W beam under\ncontinuous operation. Diverging just one-tenth of a degree, the beam was even\nslenderer and more collimated than its 200-\u03bcm predecessor and more than three\ntimes as bright as is possible with a conventional semiconductor laser. Our\ndevice also had the advantage of oscillating in a single mode, of course,\nwhich conventional lasers of comparable size cannot do.\n\nPushing PCSEL brightness higher required further innovation. At larger\ndiameters, the double-lattice approach alone does not sufficiently suppress\nhigher-order modes, and so they oscillate yet again. We had observed, however,\nthat these modes depart the laser slightly askew, which drew our attention to\nthe backside reflector. (Picture a sheet of tinfoil lining the bottom of your\nham and Swiss sandwich.)\n\nThis 50-watt PCSEL is bright enough to slice through steel. Susumu Noda\n\nIn previous device generations, this reflector had served simply to bounce\ndownward-diffracted light up and out from the laser\u2019s emitting surface. By\nadjusting its position (as well as the spacing and shape of the photonic-\ncrystal holes), we found we could control the reflections so that they\ninterfere in a useful way with the 2D standing waves oscillating within the\nphotonic-crystal layer. This interference, or coupling, essentially induces\nthe departing waves to lose some of their energy. The more askew a departing\nwave, the more light is lost. And poof! No more higher-order modes.\n\nThat is how, in 2023, we developed a PCSEL whose brightness of 1 GW/cm^2/sr\nrivals that of gas and fiber lasers. With a 3-mm emission diameter, it could\nlase continuously at up to 50 W while sustaining a beam that diverged a\nminuscule one-twentieth of a degree. We even used it to cut through steel. As\nthe bright, beautiful beam carved a disc out of a metal plate 100 \u03bcm thick,\nour entire lab huddled around, watching in amazement.\n\n## More Powerful PCSELs\n\nAs impressive as the steel-slicing demonstration was, PCSELs must be even more\npowerful to compete in the industrial marketplace. Manufacturing automobile\nparts, for instance, requires optical powers on the order of kilowatts.\n\nIt should be fairly straightforward to build a PCSEL that can handle that kind\nof power\u2014either by assembling an array of nine 3-mm PCSELs or by expanding the\nemission area of our current device to 1 cm. At that size, higher-order modes\nwould once again emerge, reducing the beam quality. But because they would\nstill be as bright as high-power gas and fiber lasers, such kilowatt-class\nPCSELs could begin to usurp their bulkier competitors.\n\nTo be truly game-changing, 1-cm PCSELs would need to level up by suppressing\nthose higher-order modes. We have already devised a way to do that by fine-\ntuning the photonic-crystal structure and the position of the reflector.\nAlthough we have not yet tested this new recipe in the lab, our theoretical\nmodels suggest that it could raise PCSEL brightness as high as 10 to 100\nGW/cm^2/sr. Just imagine the variety of unique and intricate products that\ncould be made when such concentrated light can be wielded from a tiny package.\n\nEspecially for those high-power applications, we\u2019ll need to improve the\nlaser\u2019s energy efficiency and thermal management. Even without any\noptimization, the \u201cwall plug\u201d efficiency of PCSELs is already at 30 to 40\npercent, exceeding most carbon-dioxide and fiber lasers. What\u2019s more, we\u2019ve\nfound a path we think could lead to 60 percent efficiency. And as for thermal\nmanagement, the water-cooling technology we\u2019re using in the lab today should\nbe sufficient for a 1,000-W, 1-cm PCSEL.\n\nHigh-brightness PCSELs could also be used to make smaller and more affordable\nsensor systems for self-driving cars and robots. Recently, we built a lidar\nsystem using a 500-\u03bcm PCSEL. Under pulsed operation, we ran it at about 20 W\nand got a terrifically bright beam. Even at 30 meters, the spot size was only\n5 cm. Such high resolution is unheard of for a compact lidar system without\nexternal lenses. We then mounted our prototypes\u2014which are roughly the size of\na webcam\u2014on robotic carts and programmed them to follow us and one another\naround the engineering building.\n\nIn a separate line of work, we have shown that PCSELs can emit multiple beams\nthat can be controlled electronically to point in different directions. This\non-chip beam steering is achieved by varying the position and size of the\nholes in the photonic-crystal layer. Ultimately, it could replace mechanical\nbeam steering in lidar systems. If light detectors were also integrated on the\nsame chip, these all-electronic navigation systems would be seriously\nminiature and low-cost.\n\nAlthough it will be challenging, we eventually hope to make 3-cm lasers with\noutput powers exceeding 10 kilowatts and beams shining up to 1,000\nGW/cm^2/sr\u2014brighter than any laser that exists today. At such extreme\nbrightness, PCSELs could replace the huge, electricity-hungry CO_2 lasers used\nto generate plasma pulses for extreme ultraviolet lithography machines, making\nchip manufacturing much more efficient. They could similarly advance efforts\nto realize nuclear fusion, a process that involves firing trillions of watts\nof laser power at a pea-size fuel capsule. Exceptionally bright lasers also\nraise the possibility of light propulsion for spaceflight. Instead of taking\nthousands of years to reach faraway stars, a probe boosted by light could make\nthe journey in only a few decades.\n\nIt may be a clich\u00e9, but we cannot think of a more apt prediction for the next\nchapter of human ingenuity: The future, as they say, is bright.\n\nFrom Your Site Articles\n\n  * This Mirror Reverses How Light Travels in Time \u203a\n  * Photonic Hypercrystals Are Now a Reality, and Light Will Never Be the Same \u203a\n\nRelated Articles Around the Web\n\n  * The diversity of three-dimensional photonic crystals | Nature ... \u203a\n\nlasersphotonic crystalssmart manufacturingpcselsemiconductor laserTechnology &\nComputingEducationComputingConsumer ElectronicsRoboticsInternetIT and Internet\nSupportWeb DevelopmentProgramming Languages\n\n{\"imageShortcodeIds\":[]}\n\nSusumu Noda\n\nis an IEEE Fellow and professor of electronic science and engineering at Kyoto\nUniversity, where he also leads the Center of Excellence for Photonic-Crystal\nSurface-Emitting Lasers.
