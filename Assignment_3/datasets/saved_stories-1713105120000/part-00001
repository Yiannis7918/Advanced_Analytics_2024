Locals Say\nThey\u2019re Causing It.\n\nAddicts have turned a minority neighborhood into an open-air drug market.\nResidents blame the mostly white advocates for \u2018destroying\u2019 their community.\n\nBy Olivia Reingold\n\nApril 8, 2024\n\n  * Like\n\n  * Comment\n\n  * Share\n\n## Subscribe now\n\nGet all of our stories delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nMaybe Later\n\nFor three years, Sonja Bingham, a 55-year-old mother of three, started every\nday the same way: with a broom. At dawn, she would come out to sweep away the\ndamage from the previous night\u2014the syringes, the fentanyl baggies, the\ncigarette butts, and the half-eaten sandwiches. And sometimes as she swept,\nshe couldn\u2019t help but think that the city of Philadelphia would\u2019ve never let\nthis fly during the crack epidemic.\n\n\u201cThey threw our black asses in jail,\u201d says Bingham, who\u2019s speaking to me in\nher living room where there\u2019s a TV streaming the live feed of four security\ncameras placed throughout her property.\n\n\u201cNow that the color of the addicts has changed, they\u2019re going to meet them\nwhere they are in our community and allow them to destroy it. So, now you have\nthe children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, watching how once again, our\nlives don\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nHer problem is not just with the hundreds of drug users camped out in\nKensington\u2014her neighborhood in northeast Philly that\u2019s been dubbed ground zero\nfor the city\u2019s opioid crisis. It\u2019s with an ecosystem of activists that call\nthemselves \u201charm reductionists.\u201d\n\nSonja Bingham, a community activist, yells at drug users and dealers with a\nmegaphone from her bedroom window in Kensington.\n\nThose who advocate for harm reduction\u2014a Biden-endorsed policy that prioritizes\nusers\u2019 safety over their sobriety or abstinence\u2014say they\u2019re helping fix the\nproblem. But when I visited Kensington last month, Bingham and almost a dozen\nother residents told me that the activists are actually the ones causing it.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t buy, use, and recover in the same neighborhood,\u201d Bingham says,\nechoing a line she first heard from one of her neighbors. \u201cThat\u2019s not a\nthing.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, she says anyone who complains about the nonprofit workers and\nvolunteers who hand out millions of free syringes a year in Kensington using\npublic dollars is \u201cvilified.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re being made to look like we don\u2019t care about people or we\u2019re racists,\u201d\nsays Bingham, adding that she\u2019s \u201cbeen called a lot of names\u201d by local drug\nusers, including \u201cn\u2014\u2014er\u201d and \u201cUncle Tom bitch.\u201d\n\nLocals noted that many of the activists handing out sandwiches and needles in\nKensington, which is a mostly minority neighborhood, are white. A spokesperson\nfor Prevention Point, the largest harm reduction nonprofit in Philadelphia,\ntold The Free Press that that 50 percent of their twelve-person leadership\nteam \u201care BIPOC\u201d (black, indigenous, or a person of color), and their eight-\nstrong board has \u201cthree members identifying as BIPOC.\u201d Sarah Laurel, the\nfounder of Savage Sisters, which also provides harm reduction services in\nKensington, describes herself as \u201cwhite presenting\u201d and says her father is\nIranian.\n\nBingham is tired of being told she \u201chas to care\u201d about the addicts defecating\nbetween the cars on her street and breaking into her garage. She said one\nthreatened her with a dirty needle.\n\nA growing chorus of Kensington homeowners, entrepreneurs, and even a city\ncouncil member\u2014many of them lifelong Democrats\u2014told me that for too long,\nPhiladelphia has offered harm reduction as the single solution to its opioid\ncrisis. On one end of the spectrum, harm reduction can mean doling out free\nsyringes, Narcan, and fentanyl test strips. But it can also mean \u201csafe\ninjection sites\u201d and even supplying addicts with \u201cmedical grade heroin,\u201d which\nCanada has been doing since 2020 as part of its \u201csafer supply\u201d program. There,\nas in Kensington, overdose rates have continued to reach record highs since\ninstating these protocols.\n\nBut now, all across America, even in the bluest of cities, constituents are\npushing back against harm reduction, saying that the very philosophy that\npurports to help addicts stand on their own two feet actually keeps them\ndown\u2014and ruins entire neighborhoods in the process.\n\nIn early March, Oregon became the first state in the nation to both\ndecriminalize and then recriminalize hard drugs after voters realized the\nlevel of chaos they\u2019d unleashed by making possession of small amounts of\nheroin, methamphetamine, and cocaine a civil matter in November 2020.\n\nA woman using drugs amid the garbage and needles in Kensington, Philadelphia.\n\nIn San Francisco, which got behind harm reduction in full force, briefly\nopening a city-run triage center in 2022 that critics called \u201can unofficial\nsafe injection site,\u201d there has been a major reversal. Democratic mayor London\nBreed has come out swinging against the philosophy, calling it a key driver of\nthe city\u2019s skyrocketing overdose rate.\n\n\u201cHarm reduction, from my perspective, is not reducing the harm,\u201d Breed told a\ncrowd before City Hall in February. \u201cIt is making things worse.\u201d\n\nEven as Skid Row in L.A. and San Francisco\u2019s Tenderloin steal the headlines,\nPat Trainor, a DEA agent who has been witnessing the problem in Philadelphia\nfor the past 26 years, told me, \u201cI know of no other area that has been more\nadversely impacted by the opioid epidemic than Kensington.\u201d\n\nBingham is tired of being told she \u201chas to care\u201d about the addicts defecating\nbetween the cars on her street and breaking into her garage. The other day,\nshe said one tried to threaten her with a dirty needle. She can\u2019t help but\nfeel like all the activists who visit her neighborhood, often walking past\nlocal kids to tend to the junkies, don\u2019t care about her or anyone else who\nactually lives there.\n\n\u201cDo you care that I\u2019m struggling to pay my bills?\u201d she wants to ask the never-\nending stream of volunteers. \u201cAnybody hear about that?\u201d\n\nShe takes a deep, long sigh, then slowly lifts her head. \u201cNobody wants to\nactually listen to the people who live here.\u201d\n\nHusband and wife Angel, 34, and Glenin Coll, 29, on their porch in Kensington.\nGlenin says, \u201cEven before we had children we always said we never wanted to\nraise our kids here.\u201d Angel, a barber, says, \u201cThis side of the city is just\nabandoned.\u201d\n\nSarah Laurel, the head of Savage Sisters, has more than six years of sobriety\nunder her belt, but for years she roamed the streets of Kensington, looking\nfor her next fix.\n\nThe final straw came in 2017, when a couple of drug dealers threw her out of a\nsecond-story window after an argument. She fell from the sky, hitting the\npavement in a pink dress stamped with bold, metallic letters: \u201cSavage.\u201d\n\nLater, the ICU staff had to cut the garment\u2014her one possession at the\ntime\u2014from her body in order to operate on her mangled frame. When she was\ndischarged a few days later, in a wheelchair, Laurel made a promise to\nherself.\n\n\u201cI wanted to chase my recovery with the same ferocious energy I chased my\ndrugs,\u201d Laurel, now 38, posted on her Facebook page last October in\ncelebration of her new sober life.\n\nNow, Laurel has become one of the most recognizable fixtures of Kensington\u2019s\nharm reduction scene.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to go back and help my friends,\u201d she told me over the phone.\n\nToday, her 11 \u201ctrauma-informed houses\u201d throughout the Philadelphia area offer\nrecovering addicts a safe place to stay, plus therapy sessions, yoga, and\nreiki for $160 a week in rent.\n\nWhen I asked Laurel if her goal is to help get addicts \u201cclean,\u201d she bristled.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, our friends aren\u2019t dirty,\u201d she replied. \u201cIf they want to get\ninto recovery, that\u2019s fine. Our goal is to provide safety and resources to\npeople who use drugs across the board.\u201d\n\n\u201cProgressives have basically turned harm reduction into mass enablement of\naddiction,\u201d says Michael Shellenberger, a former harm reduction advocate. \u201cAnd\nwe can see the consequences.\u201d\n\n\u201cSafety\u201d first began to overshadow sobriety in the early 1980s, when droves of\nintravenous drug users started falling ill with a mysterious illness\nscientists were calling AIDS. That\u2019s when activists began the first needle\nexchange programs, in which drug users could return syringes for fresh ones.\nAnd when studies began showing that these measures could effectively lower the\nspread of HIV, the public dollars came rolling in. By 1994, New York City\nalone had five syringe exchanges, partially funded by a $2 million grant from\nthe State Department of Health.\n\nAt that time, Michael Shellenberger, a former harm reduction advocate, was in\nthe streets of San Francisco, demanding free needles for heroin users. He says\nthese programs, which he convinced progressives like Rep. Maxine Waters to\nsupport, seemed like \u201cvery logical\u201d interventions to stop the spread of HIV.\n\nBut then he watched with horror as what first seemed like a \u201cminor\u201d part of\ntreating addiction suddenly became \u201cthe whole thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cProgressives have basically turned harm reduction into mass enablement of\naddiction,\u201d he tells me. \u201cAnd we can see the consequences.\u201d\n\nWhen he left the field in 2000, about 17,000 Americans had died from drug\noverdoses, which, Shellenberger said, seemed like \u201ca lot.\u201d As the death toll\nbegan to double, then triple, then quadruple throughout the decade, he began\nto wonder if harm reduction was actually the problem.\n\nHe tells me that \u201charm reduction became a substitute for doing the hard work\u201d\nof getting addicts clean, since most of them \u201crelapse multiple times\u201d and\nstruggle to stick to a plan. \u201cIt became a simplistic, quick, feel-good fix,\u201d\nhe said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just that it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d continued Shellenberger, who went on to\nwrite a book about his change of heart, San Fransicko. \u201cIt\u2019s making it worse.\u201d\n\nLast year, the U.S. saw more drug overdoses than ever in a 12-month period,\nwith over 112,000 Americans dead from substances. In 2022, the most recent\nyear for which data is available, Philadelphia recorded its highest number of\ndrug-related deaths: 1,413.\n\nThe streets of Kensington are full of addicts who say they\u2019ve come close to\njoining that number.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like a life where I don\u2019t live like this, but it\u2019s hard to imagine,\u201d said\nEddie. He\u2019s been homeless for the past eight years while injecting cocaine and\ntranq. \u201cMy body is so far gone, and nobody\u2019s helping me at this point.\u201d\n\nOn a Wednesday morning last month, Eddie, 29, is shaking, starting to curl\ninward. \u201cIt\u2019s just my body shivering,\u201d he tells me, draped in a Carhartt\njacket he found on the floor of a train station.\n\nYesterday he was a rich man, carrying bags of heroin that he says a dealer\ngave him to sell. But he injected them all himself. Then the dealer beat him\nwith a metal pole, focusing on his hands, which were already starting to rot\nfrom the xylazine or \u201ctranq,\u201d an animal tranquilizer that\u2019s infiltrated the\nfentanyl supply in Philadelphia since 2020. Now, he\u2019s in the early stages of\nwithdrawal, without drugs or a way to make the $3 to $7 it takes to secure his\nnext hit. And he doesn\u2019t see how to get out of the cycle.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t fucking do nothing,\u201d he said, holding his only possessions\u2014a\nnewspaper, a carton of milk, and a sweater. \u201cMy body\u2019s just so far gone. And\nnobody is helping me at this point.\u201d\n\nEverywhere you look along Kensington Avenue, there is chaos. A handful of\nusers are slumped over piles of debris on the sidewalk, rummaging through\npennies, a flip-flop shoe, and an empty Altoids container, looking for\nsomething to sell. Medical workers are helping addicts into a van, one by one,\nto bandage their wounds from injecting tranq.\n\nCrystal, a 43-year-old former prostitute, shows me the scar on her neck from\nthe time when a doctor at Prevention Point had to drain one of her injuries.\nAlthough she\u2019s been using drugs most of her life, she says she\u2019s \u201cnever seen\nwounds\u201d like the ones in Kensington.\n\nCrystal, 43, cried as she recalled her life of panhandling and drug addiction.\nOf the wounds she sees on her fellow drug users, she said, \u201cIt looks like\npeople got bit by sharks, or torn up by a bear or something, like they\u2019re\nmissing limbs.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bad out here,\u201d she tells me. \u201cIt looks like people got bit by sharks, or\ntorn up by a bear or something, like they\u2019re missing limbs.\u201d\n\nBut today is a good day because she and her partner, Pete, are headed to the\nrailroad tracks for \u201ca picnic.\u201d Once or twice a month, they like to take the\nmoney Prevention Point gives them in return for obtaining certain vaccines or\nmedications to buy a bunch of snacks, like Pringles and a Gatorade.\n\nPete just got $60 from the nonprofit for taking his monthly shot of Sublocade,\na extended-release opioid said to \u201cincrease the likelihood that a person will\ncontinue to not use drugs,\u201d according to the National Harm Reduction\nCoalition.\n\nBut Sublocade can\u2019t do a thing for his addiction to tranq, a non-opioid.\n\nAnd though Prevention Point says it gives users \u201cincentives,\u201d often in the\nform of Visa gift cards, there\u2019s nothing to stop them from buying products\nwith the cards\u2014and then selling those items for cash to buy drugs.\n\n\u201cBabe, you wanna go get something?\u201d Crystal asks Pete, passing him a few\ndollars.\n\nRight now, a group of users is lining up to pay a man named Bud $3 to $5 to\nshoot them up, since after years of injecting drugs, many of their veins have\ncollapsed. That\u2019s why they call him \u201cthe hitter\u201d\u2014because he and his steady\nhands can get anyone high.\n\nIn temps just above freezing, a dope-sick Chris (shirtless) hangs with his\nfriend Bud, known as \u201cthe hitter,\u201d because he can easily shoot up users and\nget them high.\n\nBud is surrounded by free syringes that he says he obtained through Prevention\nPoint, which told The Free Press it distributed 7,905,470 syringes last\nyear\u2014more than five times the city\u2019s population. The nonprofit\u2019s most recent\ntax filing reveals that it received more than $10 million in government grants\nin 2022, including from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. Those public\ndollars went toward programs like its syringe exchange and Beacon\nHouse\u2014Prevention Point\u2019s housing shelter that \u201cadmits people who are actively\nstill using substances.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Prevention Point told The Free Press that \u201cHarm reduction is\nmeeting people where they are. It is building trust day after day,\nconsistently, to help people move to the next place in their life.\u201d But in a\nreport from 2020, the Philadelphia Department of Health stated that the\nhighest overdose zones also \u201calign with Prevention Point Philadelphia\u2019s needle\nand syringe exchange sites.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Laurel, the founder of Savage Sisters, defends her work, saying\nthat her nonprofit treats addiction with \u201cdignity and safety.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is this antiquated idea that individuals must be made incredibly\nuncomfortable and hit \u2018rock bottom\u2019 in order to seek out treatment,\u201d she told\nme. \u201cBut that\u2019s not what harm reduction is there to do. We\u2019re not there to\ncoerce people to get into recovery or get sober\u2014we\u2019re there to mitigate harm.\u201d\n\nBud rips open a syringe packet with his teeth, telling me he does benefit from\nwhat Prevention Point gives him.\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d he adds, \u201cat the same time they\u2019re just enabling the problem.\u201d\n\nHe tells me that if the nonprofit went away, \u201cI would be doing worse, but\nthat\u2019s the point.\u201d\n\nZay, a drug user, smokes crack in Kensington, Philadelphia, on March 21, 2024.\n\nEarlier last month, Laurel and her Savage Sisters volunteers stormed through\nCity Hall chanting, \u201cWhat do we want? Harm reduction. When do we want it\u2014now.\u201d\n\nMany wore N95 masks while holding up signs with messages like \u201cBanning harm\nreduction is genocide\u201d and \u201cWhy do you want to kill my family?\u201d\n\nThey were there to push back against an effort led by council member Quetcy\nLozada, who founded the Kensington Caucus, an initiative to crack down on the\narea\u2019s open-air drug market.\n\nWhen I met Lozada on a Tuesday afternoon, she brushes off all the names harm\nreduction advocates have flung against her since starting the initiative.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t live there, your voice is not a priority to me,\u201d says Lozada,\nechoing a sentiment many residents told me\u2014that the loudest harm reduction\nadvocates often don\u2019t live in Kensington, which is 19 percent white, 28\npercent black, and 55 percent Hispanic, according to Lozada\u2019s office.\n(Prevention Point\u2019s spokesperson said 38 percent of its employees live in\nKensington. Sarah Laurel of Savage Sisters told me she is a resident of the\nneighborhood.)\n\nWhile most activists go home at five o\u2019clock, Lozada says residents remain\n\u201cprisoners in their own homes.\u201d She tells me that kids don\u2019t even play in the\nstreet anymore\u2014even McPherson Square, the local playground, is called \u201cNeedle\nPark\u201d now. And families can\u2019t buy groceries on Kensington Avenue because it\u2019s\nbeen \u201coccupied\u201d by drug users.\n\nCouncil member Quetcy Lozada founded the Kensington Caucus, an initiative to\ncrack down on the area\u2019s open-air drug market. \u201cIf you don\u2019t live there, your\nvoice is not a priority to me,\u201d she told The Free Press.\n\n\u201cWe are hurting and destroying an entire community, an entire generation of\nchildren, who in some way, one day, will be a part of our services,\u201d she tells\nme, seated at her desk. \u201cThey will be a part of our system at some point,\nbecause as a government, we have failed them.\u201d\n\nLozada is pushing for the city to institute a \u201ctriage system,\u201d in which drug\nusers would either be directed toward treatment or jail. She\u2019s already\nsucceeded in getting the city to mandate an 11 p.m. curfew for businesses in\nKensington, a first step toward tackling what she\u2019s described as the \u201ctotal\nchaos\u201d of the area.\n\nShe isn\u2019t the only city leader pushing for a return to order. At the helm is\nnewly instated mayor, Democrat Cherelle Parker, who campaigned on promises to\nclean up Kensington, even telling The Philadelphia Inquirer at one point that\nshe\u2019d enlist the National Guard to \u201cput an end to the open-air drug market and\ndrug use residents are being forced to live with.\u201d\n\nSonja Bingham says she is angered by harm reduction advocates in the\nneighborhood who \u201cwalk past a child who probably didn\u2019t have a hot meal,\u201d and\n\u201cgive it to some junkie on the ground.\u201d\n\nOn her first day in office, January 2, Parker committed to developing a plan\nto \u201cpermanently shut down\u201d the open-air drug trade in Kensington within her\nfirst hundred days in office.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans in the state House have impeached the city\u2019s district\nattorney Larry Krasner, a George Soros\u2013backed progressive who\u2019s now awaiting\nhis trial in the Senate. State Republicans blame Krasner\u2019s progressive reforms\nfor the city\u2019s near-constant gun violence.\n\nBut Sonja Bingham, the Kensington homeowner, isn\u2019t waiting for the new mayor,\nthe National Guard, or anyone else to come save her.\n\nIn 2022, she testified before the state House on her effort to clean up her\nneighborhood block by block.\n\n\u201cI am not here to advocate for addicts,\u201d she told the panel. \u201cMy purpose today\nis to advocate for those who are truly unheard, the black and brown residents\nheld captive in their homes because these people are allowed to live in our\npublic spaces.\u201d\n\nBingham told me she wants the activists to think about the message they\u2019re\nsending the kids who actually live in Kensington.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re in one of the poorest neighborhoods in the city, you\u2019re gonna walk\npast a child who probably didn\u2019t have a hot meal, right? You\u2019re gonna go right\npast them, and you\u2019re gonna give it to some junkie on the ground? Like, what\ndo you think your seeds are planting in the minds of our young people of their\nvalue and worth?\u201d\n\nShe says after three years of cleaning up her block, picking up needles, and\ncalling in hazmat teams to clean up feces from the street, her little stretch\nof Kensington is finally turning around. And when addicts wind up on her\ncorner, she picks up a bullhorn she keeps by her window to yell, You can\u2019t be\nhere!\n\n\u201cI can hear the kids playing again,\u201d she says. She can hear them pedaling\ntheir bikes down the street. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why we do what we do.\u201d\n\nOlivia Reingold is a writer for The Free Press.
