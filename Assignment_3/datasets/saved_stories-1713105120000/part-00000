We funded a few over the years, and we\ncontributed to others over the years, but nothing panned out (the history of\nthis is worth a dedicated post).\n\nAround 2013, we looked around, and there were two contenders at the time, one\nwas an embeddable engine with many cute features but not great UI support\ncalled Urho, and the other one was a Godot, which had a great IDE, but did not\nsupport being embedded.\n\nI reached out to Juan at the time to discuss whether Godot could be turned\ninto such engine. While I tend to take copious notes of all my meetings, those\nnotes sadly were gone as part of the Microsoft acquisition, but from what I\ncan remember Juan told me, \"Godot is not what you are looking for\" in two\ndimensions, there were no immediate plans to turn it into an embeddable\nlibrary, and it was not as advanced as Urho, so he recommended that I go with\nUrho.\n\nWe invested heavily in binding Urho and created UrhoSharp that would go into\nbecoming a great 3D library for our C# users and worked not only on every\ndesktop and mobile platform, but we did a ton of work to make it great for AR\nand VR headsets. Sadly, Microsoft's management left UrhoSharp to die.\n\nThen, the maintainer of Urho stepped down, and Godot became one of the most\npopular open-source projects in the world.\n\nLast year, @Faolan-Rad contributed a patch to Godot to turn it into a library\nthat could be embedded into applications. I used this library to build\nSwiftGodotKit and have been very happy with it ever since - allowing people to\nembed Godot content into their application.\n\nHowever, the patch had severe limitations; it could only ever run one Godot\ngame as an embedded system and could not do much more. The folks at Smirk\nSoftware wanted to take this further. They wanted to host independent Godot\nscenes in their app and have more control over those so they could sprinkle\nGodot content at their heart's content on their mobile app.\n\nThey funded some initial work to do this and hired Gergely Kis's company to do\nthis work.\n\nGergely demoed this work at GodotCon last year. I came back very excited from\nGodotCon and I decided to turn my prototype Godot on iPad into a complete\nproduct. One of the features that I needed was the ability to embed chunks of\nGodot in discrete components in my iPad UI, so we worked with Gergely to\nproductize and polish this patch for general consumption.\n\nNow, there is a complete patch under review to allow people to embed arbitrary\nGodot scenes into their apps. For SwiftUI users, this means that you can embed\na Godot scene into a View and display and control it at will.\n\nHopefully, the team will accept this change into Godot, and once this is done,\nI will update SwiftGodotKit to get these new capabilities to Swift users\n(bindings for other platforms and languages are left as an exercise to the\nreader).\n\nIt only took a decade after talking to Juan, but I am back firmly in Godot\nland.\n\nPosted on 23 Apr 2024\n\n#### Blog Search\n\n#### Contact\n\nEmail: miguel.de.icaza@gmail.com.\n\nRSS miguel.rss2\n\nTwitter @migueldeicaza\n\nMonoMac/MonoTouch blog.\n\n#### Archive\n\n  * 2024 Apr\n  * 2020 Mar Aug Sep\n  * 2018 Jan Feb Apr May Dec\n  * 2016 Jan Feb Jul Sep\n  * 2014 Jan Apr May Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\n  * 2012 Feb Mar Apr Aug Sep Oct Nov\n  * 2010 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\n  * 2008 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\n  * 2006 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\n  * 2004 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\n  * 2002 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Dec\n\n  * 2022 Apr\n  * 2019 Mar Apr\n  * 2017 Jan Nov Dec\n  * 2015 Jan Jul Aug Sep Oct Dec\n  * 2013 Feb Mar Apr Jun Aug Oct\n  * 2011 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\n  * 2009 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\n  * 2007 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\n  * 2005 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\n  * 2003 Jan Feb Mar Apr Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\n  * 2001 Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\n\nThis is a personal web page.
