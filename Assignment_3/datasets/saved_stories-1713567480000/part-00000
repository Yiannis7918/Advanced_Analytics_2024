But how ethical can forced identification be? Late nineteenth-\ncentury enthusiasts of pinning down the \u2018born criminal\u2019 enlisted scientific\nadvances to sinister ends. Might biometric data processing that registers\nmigrants entering the EU risk a similar transgression of human rights today?\n\nEurope\u2019s high-tech arsenal of border technologies is often narrated as a\nfuturistic tale of light, speed and computing power. Identification systems\nsuch as the Eurodac database store, process and compare the digitized\nfingerprints of migrants using near-infrared light, fibre optic cables and\ncentralized servers. Drones patrol the skies with their unblinking optical\nsensors. And large volumes of data are fed to computer programmes that predict\nthe next surge in arrivals.\n\nNews stories and NGO reports focusing on the high-tech nature of European\nborders abound. Each elicit how remote forms of surveillance, deterrence and\ncontrol increasingly supplement and, in certain cases, supersede border\nfortifications. While this kind of research and advocacy is essential for\nholding the EU and tech developers to account for their role in driving asylum\nseekers towards lethal migration routes, it glosses over the long histories of\nthese technologies and their established role in Western apparatuses of\ngovernance. This not only risks amplifying \u2018AI hype\u2019 among policymakers and\ndevelopers, who hail these tools as a means both to create \u2018smarter\u2019 borders\nand to protect the human rights of migrants. More importantly, this kind of\nhistorical amnesia can misread the violence and exclusions enacted by\ntechnical \u2018bias\u2019, which is seemingly easily corrected by more accurate\nmeasurements or larger datasets. Instead, much of the harm incurred by these\ntechnologies should be understood as inherent in their design.\n\n## A catalogue of identification\n\nThe deployment of advanced technologies to control human mobility is anything\nbut new. Picture an urban European police station in the late nineteenth\ncentury. If the municipality had adopted the latest identification technology,\nsuspects would have been subjected to a complex measurement process. Taking\ndown their measurements was a precise and highly specialized process,\nrequiring a skilled and trained technician.\n\nBertillion measurements being taken in the Palace of Education at the 1904\nWorld Fair. Image via Missouri History Museum, Wikimedia Commons\n\nConsider these instructions for measuring an ear:\n\n> The operator brings the instrument\u2019s fixed jaw to rest against the upper\n> edge of the ear and immobilizes it, pressing his left thumb fairly firmly on\n> the upper end of the instrument\u2019s jaw, with the other fingers of the hand\n> resting on the top of the skull. With the stem of the calliper parallel to\n> the axis of the ear, he gently pushes the movable jaw until it touches the\n> lower end of the lobe and, before reading the indicated number, makes sure\n> that the pinna [external part of the ear] is in no way depressed by either\n> jaw.1\n\nThis process may sound like a quaint if somewhat curious relic of the Fin de\nSi\u00e8cle, but it is anything but. Bertillonage, the system of measurement,\nclassification and archiving for criminal identification devised in the 1870s\nby the eponymous French police clerk, was a milestone in the history of\nsurveillance and identification technology. Remarkably, its key tenets\nunderwrite identification technologies to this day, from the database to\nbiometrics and machine learning.\n\nA close and historically established link exists between fears around the\nuncontrolled circulation of various \u2018undesirables\u2019 and technological\ninnovation. Nineteenth century techniques, developed and refined to address\nproblems around vagrancy, colonial governance, deviance, madness and\ncriminality, are the foundations of today\u2019s high-tech border surveillance\napparatus. These techniques include quantification, which renders the human\nbody as code, classification, and modern methods of indexing and archiving.\n\n## Modern invasive registration\n\nSmart border systems employ advanced technologies to create \u2018modern, effective\nand efficient\u2019 borders. Accordingly, advanced technologies translate border\nprocesses such as identification, registration and mobility control into a\npurely technical procedure, seemingly rendering the process itself fairer and\nless fallible. Algorithmic precision is often portrayed as a means of avoiding\nunethical political biases and correcting human error.\n\nAs a researcher of the technoscientific underpinnings of the EU\u2019s high-tech\nborder apparatus,2 I recognize both the increasing elasticity of contemporary\nborder practices, and the historically established methodology of its tools\nand practices.3\n\nTake the Eurodac database, a cornerstone of EU border management, for example.\nEstablished in 2003, the index stores asylum seeker fingerprints as\nenforcement of the Dublin Regulation on first entry.4 Fingerprinting and\nenrolment in interoperable databases are also central tools utilized in recent\napproaches to migration management such as the Hotspot Approach, where the\nattribution of identity serves as a means to filter out \u2018deserving\u2019 from\n\u2018undeserving\u2019 migrants.5\n\nOver the years, both the type of data stored on Eurodac and its uses have\nexpanded: its scope has been broadened to serve \u2018wider migration purposes\u2019,\nstoring data not only on asylum seekers but also on irregular migrants to\nfacilitate their deportation. A recently accepted proposal has added facial\nimagery and biographic information, including name, nationality and passport\ninformation, to fingerprinting. Furthermore, the minimum age of migrants whose\ndata can be stored has been lowered from fourteen to six years old.\n\nSince 2019 Eurodac has been \u2018interoperable\u2019 with a number of other EU\ndatabases storing information on wanted persons, foreign residents, visa\nholders and other persons of interest to criminal justice, immigration and\nasylum adminstrations, effectively linking criminal justice with migration\nwhilst also vastly expanding access to this data. Eurodac plays a key role for\nEuropean authorities, demonstrated by efforts to achieve a \u2018100%\nfingerprinting rate\u2019: the European Commission has pushed member states to\nenrol every newly arrived person in the database, using physical coercion and\ndetention if necessary.\n\n## Marking criminality\n\nWhile nation states have been collecting data on citizens for the purposes of\ntaxation and military recruitment for centuries, its indexing, organization in\ndatabases and classification for particular governmental purposes \u2013 such as\ncontrolling the mobility of \u2018undesirable\u2019 populations \u2013 is a nineteenth-\ncentury invention.6 The French historian and philosopher Michel Foucault\ndescribes how, in the context of growing urbanization and industrialization,\nstates became increasingly preoccupied with the question of \u2018circulation\u2019.\nPersons and goods, as well as pathogens, circulated further than they had in\nthe early modern period.7 While states didn\u2019t seek to suppress or control\nthese movements entirely, they sought means to increase what was seen as\n\u2018positive\u2019 circulation and minimize \u2018negative\u2019 circulation. They deployed the\nnovel tools of a positivist social science for this purpose: statistical\napproaches were used in the field of demography to track and regulate\nphenomena such as births, accidents, illness and deaths.8 The emerging\nmanagerial nation state addressed the problem of circulation by developing a\nvery particular toolkit amassing detailed information about the population and\ndeveloping standardized methods of storage and analysis.\n\nOne particularly vexing problem was the circulation of known criminals. In the\nnineteenth century, it was widely believed that if a person offended once,\nthey would offend again. However, the systems available for criminal\nidentification were woefully inadequate to the task.\n\nAs criminologist Simon Cole explains, identifying an unknown person requires a\n\u2018truly unique body mark\u2019.9 Yet before the advent of modern systems of\nidentification, there were only two ways to do this: branding or personal\nrecognition. While branding had been widely used in Europe and North America\non convicts, prisoners and enslaved people, evolving ideas around criminality\nand punishment largely led to the abolition of physical marking in the early\nnineteenth century. The criminal record was established in its place: a\nwritten document cataloguing the convict\u2019s name and a written description of\ntheir person, including identifying marks and scars.\n\nHowever, identifying a suspect from a written description alone proved\nchallenging. And the system was vulnerable to the use of aliases and different\nspellings of names: only a person known to their community could be identified\nwith certainty. Early systems of criminal identification were fundamentally\nvulnerable to mobility.10 Notably, these problems have continued to haunt\ncontemporary migration management, as databases often contain multiple entries\nfor the same person resulting from different transliterations of names from\nArabic to Roman alphabets.\n\nThe invention of photography in the 1840s did little to resolve the issue of\ncriminal identification\u2019s reliability. Not only was a photographic record\nstill beholden to personal recognition but it also raised the question of\narchiving. Criminal records before Bertillonage were stored either as annual\ncompendiums of crimes or alphabetical lists of offenders. While photographs\nprovided a more accurate representation of the face, there was no way to\narchive them according to features. If one wanted to search the index for,\nsay, a person with a prominent chin, there was no procedure for doing so.\nPhotographs of convicts were sorted alphabetically according to the name\nprovided by the offender, thereby suffering from the same weakness as other\nidentification systems.\n\n## Datafication\u2019s ancestor\n\nAlphonse Bertillon was the first to solve this problem by combining systematic\nmeasurements of the human body with archiving and record keeping. The\ncriminologist improved record retrieval by sorting entries numerically rather\nthan alphabetically, creating an indexing system based entirely on\nanthropomorphic measurements. Index cards were organized according to a\nhierarchical classificatory system, with information first divided by sex,\nthen head length, head breadth, middle finger length, and so forth. Each set\nof measurements was divided into groups based on a statistical assessment of\ntheir distribution across the population, with averages established by taking\nmeasurements from convicts. The Bertillon operator would take a suspect\u2019s\nprofile to the archive and look for a match through a process of elimination:\nfirst, excluding sex that didn\u2019t match, then head lengths that didn\u2019t match,\nand so forth. If a tentative match was found, this was confirmed with\nreference to bodily marks also listed on the card. Wherever this system was\nimplemented, the recognition rates of \u2018recidivists\u2019 soared; Bertillon\u2019s system\nsoon spread across the globe.11\n\nWith Bertillon, another hallmark of contemporary border and surveillance\ntechnology entered the frame: quantification, or what is known as\n\u2018datafication\u2019 today. Bertillon not only measured prisoners\u2019 height and head\nlengths but invented a method to translate distinctive features of the body\ninto code. For instance, if a prisoner had a scar on their forearm, previous\nsystems of criminal identification would have simply noted this in the file.\nBy contrast, Bertillon measured their distance from a given reference point.\nThese were then recorded in a standardized manner using an idiom of\nabbreviations and symbols that rendered these descriptions in abridged form.\nThe resulting portrait parl\u00e9, or spoken portrait, transcribed the physical\nbody into a \u2018universal language\u2019 of \u2018words, numbers and coded\nabbreviations\u2019.12 For the first time in history, a precise subject description\ncould be telegraphed.\n\nThe translation of the body into code still underwrites contemporary methods\nof biometric identification. Fingerprint identification systems that were\nfirst trialled and rolled out in colonial India converted papillary ridge\npatterns into a code, which could then be compared to other codes generated in\nthe same manner. Facial recognition technology produces schematic\nrepresentations of the face and assigns numerical values to it, thereby\nallowing comparison and matching. Other forms of biometric ID like voice ID,\niris scans, and gait recognition follow this same principle.\n\n## From taxonomy to machine learning\n\nBesides quantification, classification \u2013 a key instrument of knowledge\ngeneration and governance for centuries \u2013 is another hallmark of modern and\ncontemporary surveillance and identification technologies. As noted by many\nscholars from Foucault13 to Zygmunt Bauman14 and Denise Ferreira da Silva15 ,\nclassification is a central tool of the European Enlightenment, evidenced most\niconically by Carl Linnaeus\u2019 taxonomy. In his graduated table, Linnaeus named,\nclassified and hierarchically ordered the natural world from plants to insects\nto humans, dividing and subdividing each group according to shared\ncharacteristics. Classification and taxonomies are widely seen as an\nexpression of the fundamental epistemological shifts from a theocentric to a\nrationalistic epistemology in the early modern era, which enabled scientific\nbreakthroughs but were also tied to colonization and enslavement.16 In their\nbook on the theme, Geoffrey Bowker and Susan Leigh Star underscore\nclassification\u2019s use as a powerful but often unrecognized instrument of\npolitical ordering: \u2018Politically and socially charged agendas are often first\npresented as purely technical and they are difficult even to see. As layers of\nclassification system become enfolded into a working infrastructure, the\noriginal political intervention becomes more and more firmly entrenched. In\nmany cases, this leads to a naturalization of the political category, through\na process of convergence. It becomes taken for granted.\u201917\n\nToday, classification is central to machine learning, a subfield of artificial\nintelligence designed to discern patterns in large amounts of data. This\nallows it not only to categorize vast amounts of information but also to\npredict and classify new, previously unseen data. In other words, it applies\nlearned knowledge to new situations. While research on machine learning began\nin the middle of the last century, it has come to unprecedented prominence\nrecently with applications like ChatGPT.\n\nMachine learning is also increasingly applied in border work. Rarely used as a\nstand-alone technology, it is widely deployed across existing technologies to\naugment and accelerate long-established forms of surveillance, identification\nand sorting. For instance, algorithmic prediction, which analyses large\namounts of data including patterns of movement, social media posts, political\nconflict, natural disasters, and more, is increasingly replacing statistical\nmigration modelling for the purpose of charting migratory patterns. The\nEuropean Commission is currently funding research into algorithmic methods\nwhich would expand existing forms of risk analysis by drawing on wider data\nsources to identify novel forms of \u2018risky\u2019 conduct. Machine learning is also\nbeing either trialled or used in \u2018lie detector\u2019 border guards, dialect\nrecognition, tracking and identification of suspicious vessels, facial\nrecognition at the EU\u2019s internal borders and behavioural analysis of inmates\nat Greek camps. As this wide range of applications illustrates, there would\nseem to be no border technology exempt from machine learning, whether assisted\nimage analysis of drone footage or the vetting of asylum claims.\n\nClassification lies at the core of machine learning \u2013 or at least the type of\ndata-driven machine learning that has become dominant today. Individual data\npoints are organized into categories and sub-categories, a process conducted\neither through supervised or unsupervised learning. In supervised learning,\ntraining data is labelled according to a predefined taxonomy. In practice,\nthis usually means that humans assign labels to data such as \u2018dog\u2019 to an image\nof said dog. The machine learning model learns from this labelled dataset by\nidentifying patterns that correlate with the labels. In unsupervised learning,\nthe data is not labelled by humans. Instead, the algorithm independently\nidentifies patterns and structures within the data. In other words, the\nalgorithm classifies the data by creating its own clusters based on patterns\ninherent in the dataset. It creates its own taxonomy of categories, which may\nor may not align with human-created systems.\n\n## The supposed criminal type\n\nAs the AI and border scholar Louise Amoore points out, casting algorithmic\nclusters as a representation of inherent, \u2018natural\u2019 patterns from data is an\n\u2018extraordinarily powerful political proposition\u2019 as it \u2018offers the promise of\na neutral, objective and value-free making and bordering of political\ncommunity\u2019.18 The idea of the algorithmic cluster as a \u2018natural community\u2019\ncomprises a significant racializing move: forms of conduct associated with\nirregular migration are consequently labelled as \u2018risky\u2019. As these clusters\nare formed without reference to pre-defined criteria, such as \u2018classic\u2019\nproxies for race like nationality or religion, they are difficult to challenge\nwith existing concepts like protected characteristics or bias.19 For instance,\na migrant might be identified as a security risk by a machine learning\nalgorithm based on an opaque correlation between travel itineraries, social\nmedia posts, personal and professional networks, and weather patterns.\n\nThe creation of categories according to inherent attributes echoes and extends\nto other nineteenth-century practices: namely, a range of scientific\nendeavours using measurement and statistics to identify regularities and\npatterns that would point to criminal behaviour. Like unsupervised machine\nlearning, the fields of craniometry, phrenology and criminal anthropology\nsystematically accumulated data on human subjects to glean patterns that could\nbe sorted into categories of criminality.\n\nFor instance, phrenologists like Franz Joseph Gall linked specific personality\ntraits to the prominence of regions of the skull. In the related field of\nphysiognomy, figures like the Swiss pastor Johann Kaspar Lavater undertook a\nsystematic study of facial features as a guide to criminal behaviour. Fuelled\nby the development of photography, studies investigating signs of criminality\nin the face gained traction, with convicts and inmates of asylums repeatedly\nsubjected to such \u2018studies\u2019. The composite photographs of Frances Galton, the\nfounder of the eugenics movement and a pioneer of fingerprint identification,\nare a case in point: images of convicts were superimposed onto one another to\nglean regularities as physical markers of criminality.20\n\nCriminal anthropology consolidated these approaches into a coherent attempt to\nsubject the criminal body to scientific scrutiny. Under the leadership of the\nItalian psychiatrist and anthropologist Cesare Lombroso, criminal\nanthropologists used a wide range of anthropomorphic tools of measurement,\nfrom Bertillon\u2019s precise measurements of limbs to craniometric skull\nmeasurements, mapping facial features, and noting distinctive marks like scars\nand tattoos. On this basis, they enumerated a list of so-called \u2018stigmata\u2019 or\nphysical regularities found in the body of the \u2018born criminal\u2019 While this\nnotion is widely discredited today, the underlying method of classification\nbased on massed data characteristics still exists.\n\nTrusting the conclusions drawn from quantitative analysis of facial features\nremains a strong allure. A 2016 paper claimed it had successfully trained a\ndeep neural network algorithm to predict criminality based on head shots from\ndrivers licenses, while a 2018 study made similar claims about reading sexual\norientation from dating site photos.\n\nWhen engaging critically with these systems, it is imperative to remain\nmindful of the larger political project they are deployed to uphold. As AI\nscholar Kate Crawford writes: \u2018Correlating cranial morphology with\nintelligence and claims to legal rights acts as a technical alibi for\ncolonialism and slavery. While there is a tendency to focus on the errors in\nskull measurements and how to correct for them, the far greater error is in\nthe underlying worldview that animated this methodology. The aim, then, should\nbe not to call for more accurate or \u201cfair\u201d skull measurements to shore up\nracist models of intelligence but to condemn the approach altogether.\u201921 Put\ndifferently, techniques of classification and quantification cannot be\ndivorced from the socio-political contexts they are tasked to verify and vouch\nfor. To rephrase International Relations scholar Robert Cox, classification\nand quantification are always for someone, and for some purpose.22\n\nYet, as Science and Technology Studies scholar Helga Nowotny cautions, if we\n\u2018trust\u2019 the results of algorithmic prediction as fundamentally true, we\nmisunderstand the logic of deep neural networks. These networks \u2018can only\ndetect regularities and identify patterns based on data that comes from the\npast. No causal reasoning is involved, nor does an AI pretend that it is.\u201923\n\nWhile these machines may produce \u2018practical and measurable predictions\u2019, they\nhave no sense of cause and effect \u2013 in short, they have no \u2018understanding\u2019 in\nthe human sense.24 Furthermore, an overreliance on algorithms nudges us toward\ndeterminism, aligning our behaviour with machinic prediction in lieu of\nalternative paths. This is a problem in political cultures premised on\naccountability. If we wish to learn from the past to build better futures, we\ncannot rely on the predictive outputs of a machine learning model.\n\n## AI d\u00e9j\u00e0-vu\n\nThere are many threads besides the shared and continued reliance on\nquantification and classification one could pull on to explore the entangled\nhistory of surveillance and identification technologies from the nineteenth\ncentury to the present. Marginalized, surplus populations like convicts and\ncolonized people have long been used as \u2018technological testing grounds\u2019 to\nhone classificatory systems and train algorithms. A fear of uncontrolled human\nmobility continues to be leveraged as a driver for research and development,\nwith tech, in turn, deployed to fix problems it has itself created. And\npositivistic social scientific methods remain instrumental to the task of\ntranslating roaring multiplicities into neat, numerical values.\n\nInstead of falling for AI hype, we might instead attune ourselves to a sense\nof d\u00e9j\u00e0-vu: the unsettling feeling that we\u2019ve seen all this before. This way,\nwe might better resist the fantastical claims made by corporate and border\nactors, and begin uncoupling technologies from global projects of domination.\n\nThis article is based on research carried out during the project \u2018Elastic\nBorders: Rethinking the Borders of the 21st Century\u2019 based at the University\nof Graz, funded by the NOMIS foundation.\n\n1\n\nA.
