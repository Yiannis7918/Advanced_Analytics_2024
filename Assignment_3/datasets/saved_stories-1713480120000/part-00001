Recognizing the\nimportance of manufacturing capabilities for textiles, Tessmer\u2019s research has\nfocused on programming textiles with specific functional properties while also\nconsidering the feasibility of large-scale manufacturing of such products.\n\nA nonlinear path to MIT\n\nTessmer studied music as an undergraduate student at Duquesne University,\npursuing a passion that bloomed as a high schooler. One assignment opened her\neyes to a different career path: She was told to compare a piece of music to\nsome other artistic medium. Through this assignment, she discovered the world\nof architecture by underscoring the systematic nature of both disciplines,\nemphasizing the need for repetition and structure to unleash creativity. \u201cI\nimmediately realized that\u2019s what I want to do,\u201d she says.\n\nTessmer switched gears and decided to devote the year after college to\narchitecture, instead of auditioning for music ensembles. She says, \u201cI always\nliked making things, and then, with architecture, I realized that you can make\nthings as part of your profession.\u201d She relied on the basic drafting skills\nthat her father had taught her, and channeled these into building her\narchitecture portfolio.\n\nUltimately, she decided to pursue a master\u2019s degree in architecture at\nWashington University in St. Louis. She graduated with her master\u2019s at the end\nof the 2007 economic recession, a time when jobs in architecture were scarce.\nShe eagerly accepted a part-time role teaching at WashU. Over the next five\nyears, this role evolved into a full-time lecturer role, where she taught\nstudents while also independently establishing her own design practice and\nleading various installation design projects. Fittingly, all of the\ninstallations were inspired by textiles. \u201cThey were these high-performance\ncarbon-fiber braided structures that we hand-made into large-scale braided\nnets with specific geometries,\u201d Tessmer explains.\n\n\u201cSqueezing everything\u201d out of graduate school\n\nTeaching at WashU was a great experience, but the practice-oriented nature of\nthe architecture department motivated Tessmer to seek complementary\nperspectives on design. \u201cI wanted a totally new venue that was supportive of\nresearch and pushing the boundaries of design. I wanted to see what other\napproaches were out there,\u201d she says. As her interests continued to grow in\nthat direction, she learned that MIT has some renowned researchers in the\nfield. She decided to apply for a master\u2019s degree in architecture studies, and\nultimately a doctorate in design and computation, within the School of\nArchitecture and Planning.\n\nMIT\u2019s program stood out to Tessmer because of the interdisciplinary approach\nof the architecture department. She says, \u201cIf you are an architect or\ndesigner, it is not strange to end up in a class full of people who are not\narchitects, and that\u2019s totally normal and even expected.\u201d The integrated\nnature of her program is a shift from her previous academic experiences, where\neach discipline had been distinct and separate. She also values the lack of\nhierarchy between different disciplines within the architecture department\nhere. \u201cThere is respect across disciplines for the contribution from each\nparticipant,\u201d she says.\n\nAs an older student, Tessmer has a slightly different approach to graduate\nschool, compared to her peers. She says, \u201cMIT is amazing because there is so\nmuch variety and so many things that you can get involved in. But my style is\nto be hyperfocused on my interests. For me, there have been huge benefits to\nfocusing on this specific thing and squeezing everything I can out of it, even\nin the face of all of these other opportunities.\u201d\n\nTessmer has devoted herself to several projects throughout grad school, but\nall share a common thread: an emphasis on fiber development and textile\nprogramming. As a master\u2019s student in the Self Assembly Lab, she utilized the\ninherent properties of materials and optimized their configurations for\nspecific functions by integrating computation into the material itself. \u201cAt\nMIT, I learned a much broader definition of computation,\u201d she says. \u201cFor\nexample, in the Self Assembly Lab, we believe that material is a storage\nformat of information and that you can program material to behave in certain\nways.\u201d\n\nThe first project Tessmer worked on was designing a fiber that could respond\nto temperature fluctuations. Another project focused on embedding many\ndifferent properties within a single fabric, potentially for astronauts. \u201cThe\nhuman body is so varied in the number of properties that you need to match,\u201d\nshe says. In conjunction with collaborators across multiple MIT departments,\nshe designed a spacesuit sleeve with embedded padding, stretchable areas, a\ncompression gradient, and various sensors. Her third project has focused on\nembedding shapechange behavior into fabric structures to enhance human comfort\nor fit, as an alternative to manual tailoring. Finally, in a return to her\narchitectural roots, she is also working on designing a reinforced concrete\nbeam using textiles, a more sustainable solution to building with concrete,\nwhich has a significant carbon footprint.\n\nAnother crucial aspect of Tessmer\u2019s research is her focus on the feasibility\nof large-scale manufacturing for a product. She regularly relies on\nindustrial-scale machinery and consults with manufacturing partners. She says,\n\u201cThe way research is being conducted in the lab is a close parallel to how it\nwould be made in real life. The potential for a direct bridge between one and\nthe other is a high priority for me and a constraint that I have tried to\nlayer on to all of my projects.\u201d\n\nDabbling in entrepreneurship\n\nTessmer says with a laugh, \u201cMy entire hobby [textiles] has now been absorbed\ninto my research. So I am in the market for a new hobby.\u201d For now, that hobby\nhas taken the form of entrepreneurship. She has been exploring the\ncommercialization potential of her technologies, having filed multiple patents\nand completed the Blueprint program with The Engine Accelerator. She hopes\nthat one day her method for embedding properties in textiles, while also\nreducing manufacturing process steps, will be used for commercial fabrics.\n\nAs an example, she points to shoe manufacturing. \u201cYour shoes are normally an\nassembly of lots of different materials and lots of different layers. Instead,\nmy proposal to The Engine focused on embedding all of these properties in an\nautomated way, eliminating the need for an extensive assembly process.\u201d\nTessmer envisions entrepreneurship as one of her potential future paths.\n\nFor the time being, however, she plans to remain in academia. \u201cFrom the\noutside, being a professor seems like an unattainable position. However, I\nkeep being surprised at my ability to get to the next level of the academic\nhierarchy.\u201d She aims to integrate all her past experiences into a future\nresearch career, designing textiles within an architectural context, while\nalso weaving in the constraints of manufacturing scalability.\n\n### Share this news article on:\n\n  * X\n  * Facebook\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Reddit\n  * Print\n\n## Related Links\n\n  * Lavender Tessmer\n  * Self-Assembly Lab\n  * Department of Architecture\n  * School of Architecture and Planning\n\n## Related Topics\n\n  * Profile\n  * Students\n  * Graduate, postdoctoral\n  * Architecture\n  * Design\n  * Manufacturing\n  * Sustainability\n  * Innovation and Entrepreneurship (I&E)\n  * School of Architecture and Planning\n\n## Related Articles\n\n### Is this the future of fashion?\n\n### Redefining design through textiles\n\n### Fabric + form = a mask that uniquely fits your face\n\n## More MIT News\n\n### New major crosses disciplines to address climate change\n\nCombining engineering, earth system science, and the social sciences, Course\n1-12 prepares students to develop climate solutions.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n### Four MIT faculty named 2023 AAAS Fellows\n\nEngelward, Oliver, Rothman, and Vuleti\u0107 are recognized for their efforts to\nadvance science.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n### For more open and equitable public discussions on social media, try\n\u201cmeronymity\u201d\n\nA communication system whose users reveal only a few verified aspects of their\nidentity can empower less confident participants to speak up, researchers\nreport.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n### Erin Kara named Edgerton Award winner\n\nThe award recognizes exceptional distinction in teaching, research, and\nservice at MIT.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n### Q&A: Claire Walsh on how J-PAL\u2019s King Climate Action Initiative tackles\nthe twin climate and poverty crises\n\nSince 2020, K-CAI has innovated and tested climate policies in more than 35\ncountries and supported scale-ups that have reached over 15 million people.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n### Knight Science Journalism Program launches HBCU Science Journalism\nFellowship\n\nThe fellowship will incubate early-career science journalists, providing them\nwith a year of skill-building freelance experience and dedicated mentorship.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n  * More news on MIT News homepage \u2192\n\n## More about MIT News at Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nThis website is managed by the MIT News Office, part of the Institute Office\nof Communications.\n\n### News by Schools/College:\n\n  * School of Architecture and Planning\n  * School of Engineering\n  * School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences\n  * MIT Sloan School of Management\n  * School of Science\n  * MIT Schwarzman College of Computing\n\n### Resources:\n\n  * About the MIT News Office\n  * MIT News Press Center\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Press Inquiries\n  * Filming Guidelines\n  * RSS Feeds\n\n### Tools:\n\n  * Subscribe to MIT Daily/Weekly\n  * Subscribe to press releases\n  * Submit campus news\n  * Guidelines for campus news contributors\n  * Guidelines on generative AI\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA,\nUSA\n\nRecommended Links:\n\n  * Visit\n  * Map (opens in new window)\n  * Events (opens in new window)\n  * People (opens in new window)\n  * Careers (opens in new window)\n  * Contact\n  * Privacy\n  * Accessibility\n  *     * Social Media Hub\n    * MIT on X\n    * MIT on Facebook\n    * MIT on YouTube\n    * MIT on Instagram\n\n", "frontpage": false}
