State Police license scanners caught his black\nVolvo in Randolph, all the way on the other side of Boston, at 1:52 a.m. on\nApril 8 and then Lynn at 2:21 a.m.\n\nSurveillance video obtained by the FBI after the failed bombing showed him\nentering Salem around 2:41 a.m. He then drove around Salem for about 90\nminutes before pulling up on a street near the Satanic Temple, where he got\nout, walked over and used a lighter to ignite the pipe bomb, which he then\ntossed at the Temple building, according to the affidavit.\n\nAnd then, he raced back to his car and tried to book it out of Salem, only\nsince he's not from around there, he promptly got confused by the local roads:\n\n> As the vehicle approached the Essex Bridge, it turned and began traveling\n> south in the northbound travel late. The car then reversed, entered the\n> correct travel lane, and continued driving south. It appears from these\n> videos, therefore, that the driver of the car was likely not familiar with\n> the Salem area.\n\nIn addition to the IED, Palmer left behind a grammatically challenged note\nthat read:\n\n> DEAR SATANIST ELOHIM SEND ME 7 MONTHS AGO TO GIVE YOU PEACEFUL MESSAGE TO\n> HOPE YOU REPENT. YOU SAY NO, ELOHIM NOW SEND ME TO SMITE SATAN AND I HAPPY\n> TO OBEY. AND ELOHIM WANT ME TO CONTACT YOU TO TELL YOU REPENT. TURN FROM\n> SIN. ELOHIM NO LIKE THIS PLACE AND PLAN TO DESTROY IT. MAYBE SALEM TOO?\n> ELOHIM SEND ME TO FIGHT CRYBABY SATAN, BUT WANT ME TO MAKE HARD EFFORT SO NO\n> ONE DIES. I OBEY.\n\nDespite its name, members of the Satanic Temple do not actually believe in\nSatan: \"To embrace the name Satan is to embrace rational inquiry removed from\nsupernaturalism and archaic tradition-based superstitions. \"\n\nAccording to the affidavit, investigators found two hairs with the pipe bomb:\nOne that they have identified as belonging to a Caucasian man and one\nbelonging to a dog with dark hair. Palmer, the affidavit continues, is a white\nguy who has a dog with dark hair.\n\nPalmer, who will make his first court appearance in Oklahoma City federal\ncourt tomorrow, was formally charged with using an explosive to cause damage\nto a building used in interstate or foreign commerce, the US Attorney's office\nin Boston says. If convicted, Palmer faces up to 20 years in federal prison.\n\nInnocent, etc.\n\nNeighborhoods:\n\nSalem\n\nTopics:\n\nCrime\n\nFree tagging:\n\nSatanic Temple\n\nAttachment| Size  \n---|---  \nAttachment| Size  \n---|---  \nComplete complaint| 660.11 KB  \n  \n  * facebook\n  * twitter\n  * email\n  * print\n\n  * Reply\n\nAd:\n\nLike the job UHub is doing?

You can buy a $25 software defined radio to\nrecord this information if you wanted to make a log of almost every car that\npasses by your house.\n\nThe SDRs are also useful for logging weather station data among other things.\n\nup\n\n4\n\n  * reply\n\n### Yes, license plate scanners are recording your plates\n\nBy deselby on Thu, 04/18/2024 - 1:35am.\n\nlicense plate scanners are around, and will become more ubiquitous and\nresponsive.\n\nSince license plates are required for vehicle identification, the argument is\nthat you have no privacy interest in license plates being seen. It's a pretty\ngood argument, even if an examination of your vehicle's movements could\nintrude on your privacy and exercise of constitutional rights.\n\nMost people will take the tradeoff in today's USA. This case shows the utility\nof the scanners. Hit and runs?\n\nExtending the argument to facial recognition scanning and tracking is dubious.\nIt's true that you don't have a privacy right in your face not being seen in\npublic, or that you waive it if you go out without a mask or niqab. You are\nnot required by the government to have a photo ID in the USA, so the analogy\nto license plates is not there.\n\nLaw enforcement facial recognition use in the USA is through programs like\nClearviewAI which use the photos you and others have uploaded to social and\nother media. It's an after-the-fact thing, where CCTV images are presented to\nClearview's database for a match for further investigation. Contrast with\nChina, where constant face tracking is fed into AI programs to flag criminal\nand politically dissenting patterns.\n\nup\n\n10\n\n  * reply\n\n### While it\u2019s debatable\n\nBy Matt on Thu, 04/18/2024 - 9:11am.\n\nMany argue that your right to privacy ends at your doorstep\n\nup\n\n4\n\n  * reply\n\n### Need not be an absolute\n\nBy BostonDog on Thu, 04/18/2024 - 9:30am.\n\nI see a difference between privacy of communication and thoughts vs operation\nof a large vehicle.\n\nBasically, Verizon shouldn't be allowed to keep a record of my exact location\nand internet traffic from my phone and house.

The crime was in\nSalem/Essex County, the trial will be in Essex County.
