This is the case\nespecially in biodiversity-rich tropical nations, where roads can result in\nforest loss and fragmentation, wildfires, illicit land invasions and negative\nsocietal effects^1,2,3,4,5. Many roads are being constructed illegally or\ninformally and do not appear on any existing road map^6,7,8,9,10; the toll of\nsuch \u2018ghost roads\u2019 on ecosystems is poorly understood. Here we use around\n7,000 h of effort by trained volunteers to map ghost roads across the tropical\nAsia-Pacific region, sampling 1.42 million plots, each 1 km^2 in area. Our\nintensive sampling revealed a total of 1.37 million km of roads in our\nplots\u2014from 3.0 to 6.6 times more roads than were found in leading datasets of\nroads globally. Across our study area, road building almost always preceded\nlocal forest loss, and road density was by far the strongest correlate^11 of\ndeforestation out of 38 potential biophysical and socioeconomic covariates.\nThe relationship between road density and forest loss was nonlinear, with\ndeforestation peaking soon after roads penetrate a landscape and then\ndeclining as roads multiply and remaining accessible forests largely\ndisappear. Notably, after controlling for lower road density inside protected\nareas, we found that protected areas had only modest additional effects on\npreventing forest loss, implying that their most vital conservation function\nis limiting roads and road-related environmental disruption. Collectively, our\nfindings suggest that burgeoning, poorly studied ghost roads are among the\ngravest of all direct threats to tropical forests.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### Road expansion and persistence in forests of the Congo Basin\n\nArticle 24 June 2019\n\nFritz Kleinschroth, Nadine Laporte, ...

Steffen Fritz\n\n## Main\n\nBy the middle of this century, Earth is expected to have some 25 million km of\nnew paved roads relative to 2010\u2014enough to encircle the planet more than 600\ntimes^1. Roads serve a number of important societal functions, such as\npromoting trade and increasing access to natural resources and arable\nland^7,8,12. Without effective planning and law enforcement, however, roads\ncan also unleash a Pandora\u2019s box of environmental ills and societal\nchallenges^2,13,14,15,16. Unfortunately, many new roads are being constructed\ninformally or illegally, especially in lower-income nations where governance\nis often hindered by corruption and ineffective law enforcement^7,15. These\n\u2018ghost roads\u2019, invisible on official road maps, are one of the most vexing\ndirect threats to tropical forests and their wild and human inhabitants^6,7.\n\nWe define ghost roads operationally as those missing from the two leading\nglobal-road datasets: the Global Roads Inventory Project^17 (GRIP) and\nOpenStreetMap^18 (OSM). Ghost roads include informally or illicitly\nconstructed roads, bulldozed tracks in logged forests, roads in palm-oil\nplantations and other roads that are missing from existing road datasets for\nvarious reasons. Such roads can be either paved or unpaved, although most are\nunpaved. Ghost roads are being constructed by a range of people, including\nlegal or illegal agriculturalists, miners, loggers, land grabbers, land\nspeculators and drug traffickers, among others^6,7,8,9.\n\nThe accuracy and completeness of existing road maps vary greatly among nations\nand regions, and are typically poorest in developing nations with large forest\nestates^19,20. To assess the extent of ghost roads, we carried out an\nintensive sampling effort (1.42 million plots of 1 km^2 each) across a range\nof human-altered and native-forested regions of Borneo, Sumatra and New\nGuinea\u2014three of the world\u2019s largest continental islands. We manually mapped\nand digitized roads on each island using recent (circa 2019) high-resolution\nsatellite imagery in Google Earth. Mapping was conducted by 210 trained\nvolunteers or researchers whose individual mapping accuracy was quality-\nchecked by one or more co-authors of this study, using test datasets\n(Supplementary Information and Supplementary Fig. 1). Each mapper was required\nto attain an accuracy of more than 90% on test datasets (including road\nomissions and commissions) before commencing road-mapping.\n\nAfter generating high-accuracy road data, we (1) compared the extent of roads\nfrom our data directly with those from the two leading global-road datasets\n(GRIP^17 and OSM^18); (2) assessed how roads and other key socioeconomic and\nenvironmental variables influence forest loss; (3) gauged how protected areas\naffect the proliferation of roads and associated environmental disruption; and\n(4) used a temporal analysis to assess whether roads tend to precede, or\nfollow, deforestation across our study area.\n\n## Road extent and density\n\nWe compared our road data with those from the two global-road databases, GRIP\nand OSM, using the same 1.42 million plots for all datasets. Road extent (the\npercentage of mapped 1-km^2 cells containing at least one road) was 13.2%\nusing GRIP and 18.3% using OSM, but a much higher 32.9% when using our road\ndata (Fig. 1b). In addition, the total length of mapped roads was 3.0\u20136.6\ntimes greater when using our dataset (1.37 million km) than when using the\nGRIP (0.21 million km) and OSM (0.45 million km) datasets. Compared with GRIP\nand OSM, our data revealed that 35\u201345% of unmapped roads were in oil-palm or\nother plantations (23\u201333% in large plantations; 11\u201312% in small plantations),\n31\u201339% were in intact forests and 17\u201328% were in non-plantation agriculture\n(see Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Information for land-use\ndefinitions). Unmapped roads were less prevalent in urban areas, degraded\nforest and other land-use types (Supplementary Fig. 2).\n\nFig. 1: Road density in the tropical Asia-Pacific region is much higher than\nindicated by available global datasets.\n\na, The study region, comprising part or all of Indonesia, Malaysia and Papua\nNew Guinea (the yellow triangle shows the location of inset panels c\u2013e). b,\nCumulative plots comparing the total length of roads and proportion of land\npotentially affected by roads (road extent, percentage of 1-km^2 cells\ncontaining roads) in this study versus data from OSM and GRIP. Sites are\nordered from highest to lowest road length. c\u2013e, Mapped roads in a landscape\nin Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, as shown by GRIP (c; blue lines, imagery circa\n2018), OSM (d; red lines, circa 2020) and this study (e; black lines, circa\n2019), respectively.\n\nFull size image\n\nOur findings show that the extent and length of roads, at least in our study\narea, are severely underestimated in leading road databases and official\ngovernment statistics (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 2). Moreover, these\nbadly deficient road data partly underlie popular conservation metrics, such\nas the \u2018human footprint\u2019 index^21,22 and \u2018roadless\u2019 or \u2018wilderness\u2019\nareas^5,23, that are widely used in conservation research and management (see\nbelow).\n\n## Modelling forest loss\n\nNext, we tested the relative importance of roads and other potential spatial\npredictors in driving forest loss in our 1.42 million plots. To do this we\nfirst created a comprehensive land-cover map for our study region and then\nquantified the percentage of land cleared per plot (hereafter termed \u2018forest\nloss\u2019) as our response variable. Our map was explicitly designed to accurately\ndetect forest loss while not misclassifying current land covers, such as oil-\npalm or wood-pulp plantations, as forested land, or open vegetation, such as\nwetlands, as deforested land (Supplementary Information). We then identified\n38 key environmental, demographic or socioeconomic variables potentially\nrelated to deforestation (Supplementary Table 4). Included among these were\nneighbourhood road density (total length of roads within a 5-km radius of each\nplot) and road proximity (linear distance of the plot to the nearest road).\nMuch road building in the tropics is linked to agriculture\u2014the largest\nultimate driver of deforestation in the Asia-Pacific region^24,25,26\u2014which\nitself is influenced by underlying socioeconomic and demographic\nfactors^27,28. Roads also promote deforestation by markedly reducing the costs\nof transporting timber, bulk minerals, fossil fuels and poached wildlife to\ndomestic or international markets^27,29.\n\nTo model forest loss on the basis of our 38 potential predictor variables, we\ndeveloped a generalized linear model with LASSO regularization^11 (a technique\nthat encourages simple, sparse models, with fewer parameters and less model\nvariance and bias). Out of these 38 potential predictors, 14 had a discernible\nrelationship with forest loss (Supplementary Information), and their effects\nwere then contrasted using road datasets from this study, GRIP and OSM (Fig.\n2). Notably, the marginal relationship between road density and forest loss\nwas distinctly nonlinear (Fig. 2a). This sigmoidal curve suggests a general\nthreshold effect of roads, with deforestation rates being highest when new\nroads are first constructed in a landscape, and then gradually decreasing as\nroad density increases. Forests are expected to decline most sharply when\nroads initially encroach, up to a road density of around 4 km km^\u22122, with\naccessible forests becoming largely depleted if road density exceeds around\n7.5 km km^\u22122. Broadly similar dynamics have been observed in rural communities\nexperiencing \u2018boom-and-bust\u2019 development in the Brazilian Amazon^30, where\ninitial road building triggers rapid forest loss followed by declines in\nenvironmental and human welfare as forest resources are increasingly\nexhausted.\n\nFig. 2: Environmental and socioeconomic features that influence forest loss\nacross the tropical Asia-Pacific region.\n\na\u2013j, Partial differential plots showing relationships between the 10 most\ninfluential features and forest cover (road density (a), annual rainfall (b),\ndistance to city (c), slope (d), soil coarse fraction (e), distance to road\n(f), soil carbon (g), population density (h), soil sand fraction (i) and gross\ndomestic product (GDP) (j)). The x-axis values indicate the number of standard\ndeviations from the mean; see Supplementary Table 5. k\u2013m, Spatial predictors\nof deforestation, showing slope (beta) values for model using our road data\n(k) and the difference in slope values when using alternative road data from\nGRIP (l) and OSM (m). Abs, absolute values.\n\nFull size image\n\nIn our final LASSO regression model, several other variables\u2014annual rainfall,\ndistance to nearest city, topographic slope, soil coarse fraction, distance to\nnearest road, and country\u2014had modest explanatory power, with each having beta\n(slope) values significantly smaller than that of road density (Fig. 2b\u2013j).\nMarginal relationships of these variables with forest loss largely followed\nexpected trends (that is, forest loss was highest near townships or cities, in\nflatter areas and in less-rainy locales where forest burning is easier) (Fig.\n2b\u2013j). Notably, protected-area coverage (with a beta value of just \u22120.01) had\nlittle influence on model performance. We did not evaluate various other\npotential drivers of deforestation, especially ultimate factors (for example,\npoverty, access to global markets and social norms)^27 for which we lacked\nadequately spatially resolved data. Thus, although road density was the\nstrongest spatial predictor of forest loss in our study, we were unable to\nconsider every conceivable driver of deforestation in our model.\n\nWe also ran separate LASSO models for each country and then compared their\nperformance with that of our region-wide LASSO model, which indicated that\nIndonesia had a higher marginal rate of forest loss than did either Malaysia\nor Papua New Guinea. Notably, the region-wide model performed better (pseudo\nR^2 = 0.667) than the three country-level models (pseudo R^2 = 0.540,\ngenerated by using area-weighted averages for each nation) (Supplementary Fig.\n3). In addition, we reran our LASSO regression while excluding large-scale\noil-palm and pulpwood plantations (Supplementary Fig. 4), which are associated\nwith considerable deforestation in the Asia-Pacific region^24. This produced\nonly negligible changes in model slope parameters and overall outcome\n(Supplementary Information), underscoring the robustness of our region-wide\nmodel.\n\nThe LASSO model based on our road data, which included ghost roads, differed\nin three important ways from those based on the GRIP and OSM datasets (Fig.\n2k\u2013m). First, the model with our improved road data was considerably stronger,\nexplaining more of the total deviance in the response variable (66.7%) than\ndid either the GRIP- or the OSM-based models (49.8% and 51.0%, respectively).\nAs a result, our model was better at predicting spatial patterns of forest\nloss across our study area (Fig. 2). Second, when using our road data, road\ndensity was a much stronger correlate of forest loss (with a beta value of\n1.35, which is around 1.4\u20132.8 times greater than OSM- and GRIP-based values,\nrespectively). Third, the effect of country on forest-conversion rates\ndiffered substantially (particularly for Indonesia and Papua New Guinea) when\nusing GRIP or OSM data, compared with our comprehensive road dataset. Hence,\nthe widely used GRIP and OSM datasets are not just seriously incomplete but\nalso markedly inconsistent among nations or geographic regions (Supplementary\nTable 2)\u2014with developing nations generally having much poorer road data than\ndo wealthier nations^5,18.\n\n## Roads and protected areas\n\nNext, we assessed the degree to which areas that are designated as protected\nby the International Union for Conservation of Nature (categories I\u2013VI) limit\nroad incursions and forest loss, relative to non-protected areas, using the\nthree road datasets. We first used propensity-score matching^31 to account for\nnon-random locations of protected areas, such as biases toward steeper or less\nproductive lands (Supplementary Information). We then used separate\npropensity-score analyses to assess the capacity of protected areas to reduce\nboth road incursions and forest loss.\n\nWhen comparing matched sites, we found that average road density was more than\ntwice as high (256.7%) outside protected areas than inside them (Fig. 3a).\nHowever, after accounting for lower road densities inside protected areas, the\nmarginal effects of protected-area coverage on forest loss were surprisingly\nmodest: less than 1% in magnitude when based on the road datasets from this\nstudy, and less than 1.5% in magnitude when based on data from OSM or GRIP\n(Fig. 3b). This suggests that, on a per-kilometre basis, roads inside\nprotected areas lead to nearly as much forest loss as do roads outside\nprotected areas. We assert that the most crucial conservation function of\nterrestrial protected areas, at least in the Asia-Pacific region, is limiting\nroad incursions and their many associated impacts on forests.\n\nFig. 3: Effects of protected areas in limiting road construction and forest\nloss.\n\na, Differences in road density between protected and unprotected areas after\nsite-matching analysis. b, Marginal difference in forest loss between\nprotected and unprotected cells after site matching with the full dataset from\nthis study. For both panels, error bars show 95% confidence limits (in b, the\nerror is too small for the gap between bars to be visible).\n\nFull size image\n\n## Roads precede forest loss\n\nFinally, to test whether roads tend to precede deforestation, or rather,\nfollow it, we evaluated the temporal sequence of land-use change in 12 large\nland parcels (each around 400 km^2 in area) arrayed across Sumatra, Borneo and\nNew Guinea (Fig. 4a). We created 35 annual road maps using annual Landsat\nimagery from 1985 to 2020 and then identified the spatio-temporal relationship\nbetween road construction and deforestation using published annual\ndeforestation data^32 (Supplementary Information). We summarized this\nrelationship by classifying areas in each parcel that were deforested before,\nduring or after road construction, as well as areas that were deforested\nindependently of roads (more than 2 km from the nearest road).\n\nFig. 4: Roads usually precede deforestation.\n\na\u2013c, Temporal relationships between road construction and deforestation for 12\nstudy sites arrayed across the continental islands of Sumatra, Borneo and New\nGuinea. a, Locations of the 12 study sites. b, Partial plots for random forest\nmodels testing the temporal relationship between nearby road construction and\ndeforestation (negative values for \u2018Years since road construction\u2019 indicate\nthe number of years before road building, whereas the horizontal dotted line\nshows where true positive and true negative rates are maximized\u2014where cells\nare more likely to be deforested than not). Each individual line shows the\npartial plot from a single model iteration. c, Median deforestation rates\nassociated with different road-proximity categories. Error bars show the 5\u201395%\ninterpercentile range for each category.\n\nFull size image\n\nIn our 12 study locations, the probability of deforestation was low before\nroad construction, but spiked immediately after nearby roads were created\n(Fig. 4b). Our assessment showed that the large majority of\ndeforestation\u201492.2%, on average\u2014occurred after, or concurrently with, the\nconstruction of nearby roads (Fig. 4c). Forest loss preceded road construction\nin just 5.1% of the total area sampled. These trends indicate that forest loss\nin our study region is overwhelmingly triggered by ongoing road expansion,\nrather than vice versa. The 12 study locations include some large-scale oil-\npalm and pulpwood plantations, in which forest loss also typically followed\nroad construction (Supplementary Fig. 3).\n\n## Summary and conclusions\n\nUsing road data generated by trained volunteers, we recorded 3.0\u20136.6 times\nmore roads in the Asia-Pacific region than were found in leading global-road\ndatasets, while revealing vast numbers of unmapped \u2018ghost roads\u2019. These\nfindings have key implications for forest conservation. As a consequence of\nrapidly proliferating ghost roads, government datasets on roads often have\nlarge blind spots and inconsistencies, inhibiting spatial planning, law\nenforcement and the collection of government rents and royalties on exploited\nnatural resources (Supplementary Table 2).\n\nStriking gaps in road maps are not at all unusual, especially for developing\nnations^2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. For instance, studies in the Brazilian\nAmazon^6,33,34, Cameroon^35 and the Solomon Islands^10,36 also detected many\nunmapped or illegal roads, ranging from 2.8 to 9.9 times those recorded in OSM\nor government sources\u2014values that broadly overlap with and even exceed those\nobserved in our Asia-Pacific study area. Protected areas in this region\nprovided considerable protection against road incursions, containing just a\nthird as many roads as did comparable unprotected areas (Fig. 3a). On a per-\nkilometre basis, however, roads inside protected areas caused nearly as much\nforest loss as did those in unprotected areas (Fig. 3b). This underscores, in\nour view, an urgent need to limit unregulated road expansion in protected\nareas as a general conservation strategy^37,38,39,40.\n\nAlthough global-road databases are gradually improving in quality^41, their\nmany gaps and inconsistencies greatly limit their value for comparing\ndifferent nations, regions and ecosystem types. Furthermore, popular\nconservation metrics, such as the human footprint^21,22 and roadless or\nwilderness areas^23, are being based in part on seriously incomplete road\ndata. For example, the estimated human footprint in the environmentally\ncritical region of east\u2013central Borneo differs markedly when it is based on a\nrecent OSM road map (Fig. 5a), compared with when it is based on our road data\n(Fig. 5b). Among these differences, the mapped region in Borneo had twice as\nmuch land area with \u2018very high\u2019 disturbance (28.4% versus 14.5%), and only\nhalf as much land with \u2018low\u2019 disturbance (6.6% versus 13.6%), when based on\nour updated road map and forest-disturbance classifications from the human-\nfootprint study^22.\n\nFig. 5: Two versions of the human footprint for eastern and central Borneo,\nusing data from 2020.\n\na,b, These maps are based on incomplete road data from OpenStreetMap^22 (a)\nand more-complete road data from this study (b).\n\nFull size image\n\nThe road-mapping element of this study required around 7,000 h of effort by\nmore than 200 trained volunteers or study authors. Such an intensive\nundertaking is justified only because human eyes still outperform articial\nintelligence (AI)-based methods for identifying and mapping roads (especially\nwhen more-accurate, higher-resolution images are used, as in this study). At\nlarger spatial scales, the required effort is even more daunting. For example,\na global-scale analysis using our methods would require around 640,000 h of\neffort simply to map all of Earth\u2019s current roads just once. For this reason,\na viable AI-based road-mapping system is urgently needed^42. Such schemes are\nunder development^33,43,44,45 and could potentially be trained using major\ndatasets such as ours, aiming to provide accurate, global-scale road coverage\nin near real time. In practical terms, such an automated system is one of the\nmost urgent conservation needs for tropical forests today. Nothing else will\nkeep pace with the contemporary avalanche of proliferating roads.\n\n### Reporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio\nReporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n## Data availability\n\nThe datasets used for this study (including comprehensive road maps as a\nraster of road density at 1-km^2 resolution) are available in the\nSupplementary Information, on request to J.E.E. and W.F.L. or as follows.\nOpenStreetMap data are available from https://download.geofabrik.de/, and GRIP\nroad data from https://www.globio.info/download-grip-dataset.
