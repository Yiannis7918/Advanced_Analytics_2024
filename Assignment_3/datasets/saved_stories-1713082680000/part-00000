The project comprises a few repositories, but as a user you will\nlikely care about just one. It is:\n\n  * ipc repository - Start here.\n\nIf you'd like to contribute, the link above will surely explain how, as well.\n\nNot sure if this is for you? Please check out the Introduction to Flow-IPC\nblog-post. It summarizes the project and works through an example, including\nsome performance results.\n\n## Pinned\n\n  1. ipc ipc Public\n\n[Start here!] Flow-IPC - Modern C++ toolkit for high-speed inter-process\ncommunication (IPC)\n\nC++ 78 1\n\n### Repositories\n\nShowing 9 of 9 repositories\n\n  * ipc Public\n\n[Start here!] Flow-IPC - Modern C++ toolkit for high-speed inter-process\ncommunication (IPC)\n\nC++ 78 Apache-2.0 1 8 0 Updated Apr 12, 2024\n\n  * .github Public\n\n0 0 0 0 Updated Apr 9, 2024\n\n  * flow-ipc.github.io Public\n\nWeb site for the overall Flow-IPC product as contained in Flow-IPC\norganization\n\n1 Apache-2.0 0 0 0 Updated Mar 30, 2024\n\n  * flow Public\n\nFlow - Modern C++ toolkit for async loops, logs, config, benchmarking, and\nmore [See also `ipc` repo]\n\nC++ 1 Apache-2.0 0 25 0 Updated Mar 29, 2024\n\n  * ipc_shm_arena_lend Public\n\nFlow-IPC Sub-project - SHM-jemalloc - Commercial-grade jemalloc memory manager\nturbocharges your zero-copy work [See `ipc` repo first]\n\nC++ 0 0 1 0 Updated Mar 30, 2024\n\n  * ipc_session Public\n\nFlow-IPC Sub-project - Sessions - Painlessly establishing process-to-process\nconversations [See `ipc` repo first]\n\nC++ 0 Apache-2.0 0 0 0 Updated Mar 30, 2024\n\n  * ipc_shm Public\n\nFlow-IPC Sub-project - Shared Memory - End-to-end zero-copy transport support;\ndirect work with SHM; SHM-classic provider [See `ipc` repo first]\n\nC++ 0 Apache-2.0 0 0 0 Updated Mar 30, 2024\n\n  * ipc_transport_structured Public\n\nFlow-IPC Sub-project - Structured Transport - Transport of Cap'n Proto-backed\nstructured messages [See `ipc` repo first]\n\nC++ 0 0 1 0 Updated Mar 30, 2024\n\n  * ipc_core Public\n\nFlow-IPC Sub-project - Core - Basics, unstructured transport [See `ipc` repo\nfirst]\n\nC++ 0 Apache-2.0 0 1 0 Updated Mar 30, 2024\n\n#### People\n\nThis organization has no public members.
