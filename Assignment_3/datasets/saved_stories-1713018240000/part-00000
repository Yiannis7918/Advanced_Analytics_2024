Coded\nmessages were sent from tower to tower, with transmission being handled by\ntower operators using specially designed telescopes. The messages were decoded\nonce they reached their destination city. By the mid 19th century, the network\nspanned several hundred kilometres and covered most major French cities as\nwell as Venice, Mainz and Amsterdam.\n\nThe system was dismantled after the introduction of the electric telegraph.\nToday, about twenty Chappe towers remain, in varying states of repair.\n\n## Design[edit]\n\nDiagram of a Chappe telegraph. The regulator is segment AB. The indicators are\nsegments AC and BD. The mast is the vertical beam. At its base is the\nmechanical device (the manipulator), which the operator uses to form the\nsignal and which reproduces it in miniature (segments ac and bd).\n\nThe Chappe telegraph system embodied varying designs, with the variation\npartly due to technological improvements made as the system was used.^[1]\n\n### Physical layout of the towers[edit]\n\nThe typical tower's signaling mechanism was visible through specially designed\ntelescopes from a neighboring tower, 5 to 15 km away. The mechanism consisted\nof:^[2]\n\n  * a 7-meter sky blue mast, incorporating a ladder to access the moving parts and to carry out maintenance;\n  * the \"regulator\": a black main beam,^[3] 4.60 m long by 0.35 m wide;\n  * \"indicators\": two rotating black wings,^[4] 2 m by 0.30 m;\n  * \"ranges\": gray counterweights for each indicator\n  * the \"manipulator\": a system of cables and return pulleys at the foot of the mast in the work room, which the operator used to produce the signal. The manipulator reproduced the state of the signaling mechanism in miniature so that the operators could see what they were doing;\n\nThe regulators and indicators had fixed louvres to reduce wind resistance.^[5]\n\n### Telescopes[edit]\n\nTwo telescopes were used in each tower to see the signals up- and downstream\nfrom that tower. They had magnifications between 30\u00d7 and 65\u00d7, depending on the\narrangement of the towers. Each telescope was mounted in a wooden housing that\nkept it fixed and focused on one of the neighbouring towers.^[6] This avoided\nthe need to adjust the telescope for each message.\n\n### Coding and deciphering[edit]\n\nList of numerical values of Chappe signals. Document preserved in the museum\nof Saint-Marcan.\n\nThe code was based on different configurations of the moving parts of the\ntelegraph. The regulator could take two positions (horizontal and vertical)\nand each of the indicators could take seven positions. Thus, the total number\nof possible signals was 2 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 7 = 98. Six of these signals were reserved for\nservice purposes, for example to signal \"end of message\" or to indicate an\nerror or the absence of an operator. This left 92 possible signals, each\nassociated with a number, used to communicate the message itself.^[7] The\ntelegraph configurations corresponding to each number (1-92) are shown in the\nimage on the left.\n\nPage from the Chappe telegraph code book\n\nThe message was coded at the tower of origin using a code book and decoded at\nthe destination tower using an identical book. The code book contained 92\npages, each of which contained 92 entries, each with a word, a series of\nrelated words, or an expression. Messages were composed of words and\nexpressions from the 8464 (92 \u00d7 92) possible choices.^[8] For each word or\nexpression, two symbols were transmitted; the first indicated the page number\nfor the word or expression, and the second indicated the word's position on\nthe code book's page.^[8] For example, as shown in the photo on the right, the\ncode for \"ignorance\" would be (50, 87) since the word is on page 50 in\nposition 87.\n\n## History[edit]\n\nCommunication over long distances is a recurrent problem in history. This\nproblem was particularly pressing in France at the height of the French\nRevolution, as the country was surrounded by the hostile forces of Britain,\nAustria, Prussia and the Netherlands. In this context, France would obtain\nstrategic advantage if, unlike its enemies, it had a rapid system of reliable\ncommunication.\n\nThe telegraph Chappe provided just such a system of rapid and reliable\ncommunication. For example, sending a message carried by horses from\nStrasbourg to Paris took 4 days. With the Chappe telegraph, it took 2\nhours.^[9]\n\nConstruction of the system began in the early 1790s and proceeded rapidly\nafter that. It continued to be used for decades, but its decline began when\nthe first electric telegraph line, based on International Morse code, was set\nup in 1845. The last signal from a Chappe telegraph was sent in 1854.^[10]\n\n### Invention[edit]\n\nClaude Chappe, 1765-1828\n\nIn 1791, Chappe conceived a project that was to put \"the government in a\nposition to transmit its orders over a great distance in the least possible\ntime\".^[4] Having experimented with several solutions involving both sight and\nsound, he finally opted for the transmission of optical signs via a semaphore\nsystem with transmission effected by observation through a telescope.^[3]\nChappe found experimentally that the angle of the moving pieces of the\ntelegraph was easier to discern accurately at a distance than other\ncharacteristics of the towers or other sources of signal.\n\nOn 2 and 3 March 1791, Chappe tested an optical telegraph with a system of\nsynchronized pendulums and a white and black optical panel between the cities\nof Br\u00fblon and Parc\u00e9 in the Loire region. He then transmitted the following\nmessage: \"The National Assembly will reward experiences that are useful to the\npublic.\"^[11]\n\nIn June 1791, Chappe moved to Paris and carried out new experiments in\nM\u00e9nilmontant, on a site near what is now the rue du T\u00e9l\u00e9graphe in the 20th\narrondissement of Paris (this is the highest point in the city). Chappe and\nhis associates then sought political support in order to install the system\nthroughout France. On 22 March 1792 Chappe submitted a petition to the\nLegislative Assembly, in which he described his invention as \"a reliable means\nof establishing a correspondence such that the legislative body can send its\norders to our frontiers and receive the answer during the duration of the same\nsession.\"^[12]^[13] On 1 April a report vaunting the military use of the\ntelegraph was presented to the National Convention on behalf of the Committees\nfor Public Instruction and War.^[14]\n\nOn 12 July 1793 a successful first test was carried out over a distance of 26\nkm, between M\u00e9nilmontant, \u00c9couen and Saint-Martin-du-Tertre (in the\nVal-d'Oise, near Paris). On 25 July Chappe was appointed telegraph engineer by\ndecree. After a convincing presentation by Joseph Lakanal in support of the\nproject, the National Convention approved the construction of the Paris-Lille\ntelegraph line on 4 August 1793.^[15] In a letter sent the following day,\nChappe described the benefits of the system for the political unification of\nFrance as follows:\n\n> The establishment of the telegraph is, in fact, the best response to authors\n> who think that France is too large to form a Republic. The telegraph\n> shortens distances and somehow unites an immense population at a single\n> point.^[16]\n\n### Construction[edit]\n\nThe first Chappe telegraph line was a series of towers linking Paris and\nLille, a distance of 230 kilometres. The Paris-Lille line was operational for\nmilitary purposes only. Its fifteen towers made it possible to transmit a\nshort message between these two cities within 9 minutes. Later developments\nadded the major French cities, with Paris being the central node of the\nsystem. Between Paris and Brest in Brittany, 58 stations dotted the\nroute.^[17] In addition to Paris-Lille in 1794, other cities initially served\nwere: Strasbourg in 1798 and Brest in 1799. By 1844, 534 towers criss-crossed\nFrench territory, linking the 29 most important cities and covering more than\n5,000 km.^[18]\n\nThe network was also extended in Europe as far as Amsterdam, Mainz and\nVenice,^[18] and in North Africa, where it covered Algeria (Algiers-Oran and\nAlgiers-Constantine in 1853) and Tunisia (Tunis-La Goulette and Tunis-\nMohamedia in 1848\u20131849).^[19]\n\nOriginally, the mechanisms were built by the workshops of the central\nadministration in the premises of the administration of the telegraph. From\n1833 onwards, they were built in Paris in a workshop. This workshop\nspecialised in the manufacture of telegraphs and other machines and was\nlocated at 882, passage du D\u00e9sir, faubourg Saint-Denis in what is now the 10th\narrondissement of Paris.^[20]\n\nThe telescopes used in the system were originally produced in England, but\nwere very expensive. The government encouraged the development of French\nproduction capabilities, which eventually replaced English sources.^[6]\n\n### Management and personnel[edit]\n\nA Chappe tower at 103, rue de Grenelle in the 7th arrondissement of Paris\n\nOriginally, the system was managed by Claude Chappe and his brothers. This\nfamily-based system lasted until the July Monarchy in 1830, after which it was\nreplaced by an administrative system that was both hierarchical and military\nin style. Under it, three top administrators managed four departments\n(messaging, personnel, plant and equipment, and accounting). The headquarters\nwere located in the 7th arrondissement of Paris.^[21]\n\nAt the operational level, directors were responsible for coding, decoding,\ndistributing and entering telegraph dispatches. Below them, inspectors were\ntasked with overseeing groups of about ten towers, including keeping the plant\nand equipment in good working order, supervising the tower operators,\nidentifying the source of transmission errors and sanctioning operators for\npoor performance.^[21] The inspectors used military telescopes to observe and\nevaluate the performance of individual towers.^[6]\n\nThe tower operators accounted for more than 90 percent of the system's\npersonnel. Originally, each tower had two operators, one for reading the\nsignals and the other for manipulating the transmission mechanism. The\noperators did not have the code book needed to decipher the signals. Operators\nalso had to verify that the next tower down the line did not make a mistake\nwhen retransmitting the message.^[22] The operators worked 365 days per year,\nwere sanctioned for mistakes and were paid the same wages as a construction\nday-worker. Later, because of funding problems, often only one operator was\nassigned to each tower.^[21]\n\n### Use and misuse[edit]\n\nA Chappe Telegraph dispatch sent on 24 August 1838 from Paris to Toulouse\nannouncing the birth of the first son of the Duc d'Orl\u00e9ans. The message was\ntransmitted in two and a half hours.\n\nThe towers were effective in allowing news to travel quickly around France.\nThe first military use of the system was made to report the recapture from\nAustrian forces of the cities of Le Quesnoy on 15 August 1794 and the town of\nCond\u00e9-sur-l'Escaut on 30 August 1794. The news of these victories was known by\nthe National Convention in Paris within a few minutes.^[23]\n\nPrivate parties also took steps to profit from the rapid communications\noffered by the Chappe telegraph. Between 1834 and 1836, the telegraph was used\nby two Bordeaux businessmen, the brothers Fran\u00e7ois and Joseph Blanc, to\nreceive information on Paris Stock Exchange annuity prices before anyone else.\nThe use was discovered in 1836 and the two brothers spent time in jail\nawaiting trial but were ultimately found not guilty because there was no law\nagainst this behaviour, although they did have to pay a fine for bribing some\nof the telegraph operators.^[24]\n\n## Reception by French society[edit]\n\nCover of an Alsatian almanac from 1837, showing the Strasbourg cathedral with\na Chappe telegraph on its roof.\n\nThe first phases of construction of the system aroused the suspicions of the\npopulation. In several instances, the local telegraphs were destroyed during\npopular uprisings,^[25] possibly due to suspicions of witchcraft, but more\nprobably in order to hinder government communications.^[26]\n\nMany French writers of the time featured the telegraph in their writings\n(Hugo, Dumas, Chateaubriand, Stendahl, Flaubert). Alexandre Dumas incorporated\nit into his novel, The Count of Montecristo, with the Count pirating the\nsystem (through bribery) in order to undermine the financial position of one\nof his enemies. Victor Hugo described his horror at discovering, while\ntraveling in Normandy in 1836, that the statue of the Archangel on the\npinnacle of the steeple of the abbatial church of Mont Saint Michel had been\nreplaced by a Chappe telegraph.^[7]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Optical communication\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"Les techniques du t\u00e9l\u00e9graphe Chappe\". www.telegraphe-chappe.com.
