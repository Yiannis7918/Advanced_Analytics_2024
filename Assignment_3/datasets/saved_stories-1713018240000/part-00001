And it's not\njust me! I am working with collaborators from around the world to create\ndetailed CT scans of fish from museum specimens. One of the very, very useful\nthings is to understand exactly what the skeleton looks like. It is shockingly\ncomplex. For comparison, your skull is just a few bones, but fish skulls are\ndozens and dozens of bones. In the first three months of the project, we were\nable to scan more than 500 species!\n\nAn important part of this project is getting all our results up on the web for\nanyone to access for any purpose. To allow the general public and every\nscientist out there to just download these data is fabulous. It also\neliminates the needs for multiple teams to scan the same species of fish and\nusing valuable resources for overlapping work.\n\n### These scans & data are available to anyone who wants to use them, for\nresearch or otherwise.\n\n### CT scanner\n\nThis project uses a mini CT-scanner, which is different than the full-size\ndonut scanners used in hospitals. By creating a \"fish burrito\", we can scan\nmany fish at the same time, and it will only take only a few years to scan all\nthe fishes in the world at our current rate thanks to our novel approach to\nscanning.\n\n### scans available\n\nOnce the scan is complete, I make them available online. You can see all the\nones we've made on Open Science Framework here. We focus on using museum\nspecimens, and for larger species we scan juveniles, not full-size adults so\nthey still fit in our scanner.\n\n### 3-d printing\n\nThe scans can be used for research directly or used to create 3-D prints of\nfish parts for more biomechanics-related work. 3D-printable versions of our\nscans are on Open Science Framework here.\n\nscan your fish\n\n## fishguy@uw.edu\n\n### Adam Summers Friday harbor Laboratories University of Washington 620\nUniversity Drive Friday Harbor, WA 98250\n\n", "frontpage": false}
