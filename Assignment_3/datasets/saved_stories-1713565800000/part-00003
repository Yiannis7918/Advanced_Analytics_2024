And that\u2019s exactly what our entrepreneurial CEO\n(Bailey Stockdale) got up to over the holidays with some interesting findings\nto share about creating an agronomy chatbot.\n\nIn 2023 the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in agriculture was a hot\ntopic and an obvious trend that sparked many discussions. There are already\nmany ways AI is being used in agriculture but there are still many unknowns\nand uses to explore. Fascinated by the idea of an agronomy chatbot as an\napplication of AI in agriculture, Bailey set out to demonstrate how this could\nlook.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that Leaf has no current plans to offer this as a\nproduct and is a proof of concept at this stage, but the demo code is all\nopen-sourced so anyone can access it. Now onto the findings:\n\n### Project #1: talk to your fields\n\n\u2018Talk to your fields\u2019 is a concept where you can ask an AI chatbot questions\nabout your raw data (field operations like planting, applications, harvest and\ntillage); the model will construct queries to Leaf's API, retrieve the data\nand display it in a human-readable format. In Bailey\u2019s project, the chatbot he\ncreated was able to answer questions such as \u201cWhich field was most recently\nplanted?\u201d, \u201cWhich variety was planted\u201d and \u201cWhen did the operation begin and\nend?\u201d. I\u2019m sure growers would love to ask questions about machine performance,\ncosts and other indicators and get an answer without having to dig too deep\ninto the raw data.\n\nBut as Shane Thomas explores in his recent Upstream Ag Professional\nnewsletter, there are limitations to consider for the use of Large Language\nModels (LLMs) in agronomy. One limitation is that the effectiveness of AI\nchatbots for agronomic questions depends on the specificity of the prompts,\nwhere context and the many farming variables (such as weather, location and\nvariety) are very important when making an agronomic decision. Another factor\nto consider is the proficiency of the model and how well the model has been\ntrained, which leads us to Bailey\u2019s second project on benchmarking.\n\n### Project #2: benchmarking LLMs' ability to answer agronomic questions.\n\nBy setting up benchmarking, we can determine which AI models best answer\nagronomic questions. Bailey\u2019s second project assesses the model\u2019s ability to\nanswer multiple choice CCA exam questions as a proof of concept and in the\nresults you can see how each model performed. Bailey hopes that a leaderboard\nencourages faster improvement of the models and mentioned that he might try\nfree-form questions soon too. He has also been working on training the models\nwith agronomy textbooks and a benchmarking tool like this helps validate\nwhether training has improved accuracy.\n\n### Project #3: creating the first open-sourced agronomy AI model\n\nIn summary, Bailey has provided a proof of concept for an agronomy chatbot and\nfound a way to benchmark model accuracy. Making an agronomy chatbot tool could\nalready be made a reality, but there are some limitations to work through\nbefore using it with confidence. Leaf doesn't plan to offer these projects as\nproducts at this stage, however the code is open-sourced, extending an\ninvitation to all curious minds in agtech to explore further (talk to your\nfields, benchmarking & the open source agronomy AI model).
