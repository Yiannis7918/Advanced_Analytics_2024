The text-to-voice station was an original element of the\ncounty\u2019s PASSAGE intelligent transportation system, above. Courtesy of Lake\nCounty Division of Transportation\n\nAfter nearly 20 years on air, Lake County\u2019s Highway Advisory Radio 1620 AM is\nbeing retired. The voice-to-text station shared broadcast information gathered\nat the county\u2019s transportation management center, above. Courtesy of Lake\nCounty Division of Transportation\n\nAn AM radio station operating for nearly 20 years in Lake County never\nregistered on any ratings or rankings. But for awhile it was a reliable source\nof traffic information when there was a need to know.\n\nOnce an integral element to alert motorists to crashes and other situations in\nreal time, AM 1620 is going off the air May 1.\n\nThe five transmission towers need an investment of $400,000 or more to\ncontinue operating and with many other ways to track Lake County roads the\nfate of Highway Advisory Radio was sealed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s served a great purpose for us,\u201d said Jon Nelson, assistant county\nengineer.\n\nNews of the pending retirement has been broadcast the past few weeks in the\nfamiliar mechanical voice-to-text delivery. The message also is on the Lake\nCounty PASSAGE website and app, the mainstays of an intelligent transportation\nsystem introduced in 2006.\n\nLike an old wooden tennis racket in a pickleball era, the little 10-watt\nstation has become more nostalgia than necessity.\n\nNot that it is without fans. Though meant to cover Lake County, two people in\nFinland and a man in New York emailed the Lake County Division of\nTransportation saying they could hear the station, Nelson said.\n\nBut these days, many electric vehicles don\u2019t have radios and some may be hard\npressed to find AM radio on their devices.\n\nThe original three transmission towers were installed along Interstate 94 in\n2005 and two more added for western Lake County in 2010. Nelson noted the\niPhone came out in 2007, Google maps began providing traffic information in\n2008 and expanded in 2012 to more urban areas.\n\nPASSAGE debuted as an innovative combination of technology and communications\nto gather information, improve traffic flow and manage congestion on arterial\nroads. It operates from the Transportation Management Center on the Lake\nCounty government campus in Libertyville.\n\nAmong other functions, 675 traffic signals and more than 1,100 cameras are\nmonitored. In January, there were 43,143 website sessions, 47,449 phone app\nsessions, 263,048 email notifications and 4,433 X engagements, Nelson\nreported.\n\nThe website now is a go-to resource for information on crashes, construction\nor congestion. But it wasn\u2019t available until a year after PASSAGE opened so\n1620 AM was a key element.\n\n\u201cThe main service was the radio station,\u201d Nelson said.\n\nSpecific figures weren\u2019t available but surveys have shown a declining\naudience, Nelson said. The towers are getting old and rusty and each one\nrequires a dedicated fiber optic cable as a direct connection to PASSAGE, he\nadded. Replacing them would cost $400,000. Removing them will cost $50,000.\n\n\u201cThis really is antiquated technology and to pay that kind of money to fix an\nAM broadcast station, I wouldn\u2019t be in support of it,\u201d said county board\nmember J. Kevin Hunter of Ingleside. Hunter is a member of the county board\u2019s\npublic works and transportation committee, which unanimously recommended\nretiring the station.\n\nWhether that would leave the county without an outlet in an emergency, like\nthe cell network going down, was among the questions.\n\nDan Eder, program manager of the Lake County Emergency Management Agency, said\n1620 AM was introduced for road-related issues for people in vehicles and not\nintended as a source of mass notification if cell systems fail.\n\nIn that case, EMA would work directly with Radio Amateur Civil Emergency\nServices, which has a variety of redundant communications tools and methods,\nEder said.\n\nRACES is housed in the Lake County Emergency Center and can work directly with\nstate and federal partners to coordinate communication, most recently during\nthe solar eclipse, he added.\n\nWhen cellphones, regular phones, the internet and other systems are down or\noverloaded amateur radio hobbyists, known as \u201chams,\u201d still get through, Eder\nadded.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s also a service \u2014 a vital service that has saved lives when regular\ncommunications systems failed,\u201d Eder said.\n\nNelson said Chicago and other news media follow PASSAGE and other\ncommunications channels and there are ample avenues to find what 1620 AM has\nprovided.\n\n0\n\nArticle Comments\n\nArticle Categories Communities Counties Lake County Libertyville News\nTransportation\n\n### \u2018Lives are at stake\u2019: Suburban lawmaker targets protesters blocking\ntraffic If you were among the hundreds delayed, detoured or just plain\ndisturbed by the protests Monday that blocked the expressway entrance to\nO\u2019Hare International Airport, you\u2019ve got a like-minded soul ...\n\n### Man pleads guilty to aggravated DUI for crash that killed his passenger A\nLake in the Hills man who was driving 124 mph just seconds before crashing his\ncar on I-90, killing a passenger, has pleaded guilty to aggravated DUI \u2012\naccident causing death.
