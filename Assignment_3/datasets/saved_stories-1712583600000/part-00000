However,\n> it is unclear how meaningful the notion of \"zero-shot\" generalization is for\n> such multimodal models, as it is not known to what extent their pretraining\n> datasets encompass the downstream concepts targeted for during \"zero-shot\"\n> evaluation. In this work, we ask: How is the performance of multimodal\n> models on downstream concepts influenced by the frequency of these concepts\n> in their pretraining datasets? We comprehensively investigate this question\n> across 34 models and five standard pretraining datasets (CC-3M, CC-12M,\n> YFCC-15M, LAION-400M, LAION-Aesthetics), generating over 300GB of data\n> artifacts. We consistently find that, far from exhibiting \"zero-shot\"\n> generalization, multimodal models require exponentially more data to achieve\n> linear improvements in downstream \"zero-shot\" performance, following a\n> sample inefficient log-linear scaling trend. This trend persists even when\n> controlling for sample-level similarity between pretraining and downstream\n> datasets, and testing on purely synthetic data distributions. Furthermore,\n> upon benchmarking models on long-tailed data sampled based on our analysis,\n> we demonstrate that multimodal models across the board perform poorly. We\n> contribute this long-tail test set as the \"Let it Wag!\" benchmark to further\n> research in this direction. Taken together, our study reveals an exponential\n> need for training data which implies that the key to \"zero-shot\"\n> generalization capabilities under large-scale training paradigms remains to\n> be found.\n\nComments:| Extended version of the short paper accepted at DPFM, ICLR'24  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Computation and\nLanguage (cs.CL); Machine Learning (cs.LG)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.04125 [cs.CV]  \n(or arXiv:2404.04125v1 [cs.CV] for this version)  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Vishaal Udandarao [view email] [v1] Thu, 4 Apr 2024 17:58:02 UTC (37,862\nKB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled No \"Zero-Shot\" Without Exponential Data:\nPretraining Concept Frequency Determines Multimodal Model Performance, by\nVishaal Udandarao and 7 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CV\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.CL cs.LG\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
