Your profile can be used (also later) to present\nadvertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by\nthis and other entities.\n\nIf you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this\ninformation could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike\naccessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a\ndifferent website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike\naccessory brand.

Instead, he made the once-grand\nhotel his full-time residence for the next five years, without ever paying\nanother cent.\n\n### Listen to this article with reporter commentary\n\nListen 22:41\n\nOpen this article in the New York Times Audio app on iOS.\n\nIn a city where every inch of real estate is picked over and priced out, and\nwhere affordable apartments are among the rarest of commodities, Mr. Barreto\nhad perhaps the best housing deal in New York City history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nNow, that deal could land him in prison.\n\nThe story of how Mr. Barreto, a California transplant with a taste for wild\nconspiracy theories and a sometimes tenuous grip on reality, gained and then\nlost the rights to Room 2565 might sound implausible \u2014 another tale from a man\nwho claims without evidence to be the first cousin, 11 times removed, of\nChristopher Columbus\u2019s oldest son.\n\nBut it\u2019s true.\n\nWhatever his far-fetched beliefs, Mr. Barreto, now 49, was right about one\nthing: an obscure New York City rent law that provided him with many a New\nYorker\u2019s dream.\n\nImage\n\nMickey Barreto was born in Brazil and came to the United States in the 1990s\nto attend college.Credit...John Taggart for The New York Times\n\n## The First Night\n\nOn that summer afternoon nearly six years ago, Mr. Barreto walked through the\nhotel\u2019s revolving door on Eighth Avenue and entered a lobby centered by a\n20-foot Art Deco chandelier, a nod to the hotel\u2019s geometric architecture.\n\nWhen it opened in 1930, to great fanfare, the New Yorker Hotel was not just\nthe largest in the city but also the second largest in the world. It was an\nopulent hotel of the future, with 92 telephone operators, a power generating\nplant and a radio with four channels in each room.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nToday, the mystique has faded, though the property still attracts tourists\nwith its central location. Less than half the rooms are open to guests, and\nthe hallway carpet is tattered and lined with brightly lit vending machines of\nsodas and snacks. Most of the building is occupied by followers of the Rev.\nSun Myung Moon, a self-proclaimed messiah who bought the hotel in 1976 and\nmade it his organization\u2019s headquarters.\n\nEven by New York City standards, the room to which Mr. Barreto was assigned\nwas small, just under 200 square feet. The beds consumed most of the maroon\nand gold carpeted space. A tiny closet could fit a handful of garments. There\nwas also a 42-inch TV with free HBO.\n\nOver the course of several recent interviews, Mr. Barreto described what\nhappened next \u2014 events that led to a yearslong ordeal for the hotel.\n\nIn conversation, Mr. Barreto vacillates between lucid and unstable. He said he\nexperiences panic attacks and seizures but insisted he had never been\ndiagnosed with a mental illness \u2014 even as he claimed to be the chief of an\nIndian tribe he founded in Brazil.\n\nMuch of Mr. Barreto\u2019s story is corroborated by years of court records, but one\ncrucial moment comes from only his account: On that first night, he settled\ninto his room, high above Midtown, along with his partner, Matthew Hannan.\nBefore that night, Mr. Barreto says, Mr. Hannan had mentioned, in passing, a\npeculiar fact about affordable housing rules that pertain to New York City\nhotels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nWith their laptops open, he claimed, they explored whether the New Yorker\nHotel was subject to the rule, a little-known section of a state housing law,\nthe Rent Stabilization Act.\n\nPassed in 1969, the law created a system of rent regulation across the city.\nBut also subject to the law was a swath of hotel rooms, specifically those in\nlarge hotels built before 1969, whose rooms could be rented for less than $88\na week in May 1968.\n\nAccording to the law, a hotel guest could become a permanent resident by\nrequesting a lease at a discounted rate. And any guest-turned-resident also\nhad to be allowed access to the same services as a nightly guest, including\nroom service, housekeeping and the use of facilities, like the gym.\n\nThe room becomes, essentially, a rent-subsidized apartment inside a hotel.\n\nDespite the reasonable assumption that what he was undertaking had been\norchestrated from the start, Mr. Barreto claimed the idea only took shape when\nhis and Mr. Hannan\u2019s online search stumbled upon the 27th line of a 295-page\nspreadsheet titled \u201cList of Manhattan Buildings Containing Stabilized Units.\u201d\n\nAccording to court documents, Mr. Barreto left his room the next morning, rode\nthe elevator to the lobby and greeted a hotel employee at the front desk. He\nhanded over a letter addressed to the manager: He wanted a six-month lease.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe employee dialed the manager, and after a brief exchange, Mr. Barreto was\ntold there was no such thing as a lease at the hotel and that without booking\nanother night, he would have to vacate the room by noon. The couple did not\nremove their belongings, so the bellhops did \u2014 and Mr. Barreto headed to New\nYork City Housing Court in Lower Manhattan and sued the hotel.\n\nIn a three-page, handwritten affidavit dated June 22, 2018, Mr. Barreto cited\nstate laws, local codes and a past court case in arguing that his request for\na lease made him a \u201cpermanent resident of the hotel.\u201d Removal of his items\namounted to an illegal eviction, he said.\n\nAt a hearing on July 10, in the absence of any hotel representatives to oppose\nthe lawsuit, the judge, Jack Stoller, ruled in Mr. Barreto\u2019s favor. Judge\nStoller not only agreed with his arguments; he even cited the same case law as\nMr. Barreto and ordered the hotel \u201cto restore petitioner to possession of the\nsubject premises forthwith by providing him with a key.\u201d\n\nMr. Barreto returned to Room 2565 within days, now as a resident of the hotel\n\u2014 and soon, as its new owner.\n\nImage\n\nThe New Yorker Hotel opened to great fanfare but more recently has shown signs\nof aging.Credit...John Taggart for The New York Times\n\n## The Finance Department\n\nBack in their room days after the ruling, the couple read Judge Stoller\u2019s\nruling over and over. In it, there was no order that the hotel provide a\nlease, no limit on their stay, no suggestion that rent was due.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut one word was mentioned throughout: possession. Mr. Barreto was given\n\u201cfinal judgment of possession.\u201d\n\nMr. Barreto said he called the court to ask someone to explain what exactly\nthat meant.\n\n\u201cYou have possession,\u201d Mr. Barreto \u2014 sharply and slowly stressing every\nsyllable of the final word \u2014 said he was told. \u201cYou\u2019re not a renter. You have\npossession of a building.\u201d\n\nAnd how is possession of real estate recorded? In New York City, it is at the\nDepartment of Finance.\n\nWith the judge\u2019s order in hand, Mr. Barreto and Mr. Hannan visited the\ndepartment\u2019s Lower Manhattan offices. Mr. Barreto said he asked a clerk about\nputting Room 2565 in his name \u2014 as a new homeowner would \u2014 but was told that\nwould be impossible because the hotel, unlike apartments, was not split up in\ncity records by rooms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe property had one entity on file, the hotel itself, identified in city\nrecords as Block 758, Lot 37. So, citing the judge\u2019s order, Mr. Barreto filled\nout paperwork declaring his ownership of that.\n\n\u201cIf I have the right to register it all,\u201d Mr. Barreto recalled thinking, \u201cthen\nI will register it all.\u201d\n\nIn New York City, a change of ownership is recorded in the voluminous\nAutomated City Register Information System, or ACRIS, which holds the real\nestate records for every property. Thousands of documents like deeds and\nmortgages are received and published daily, too many for the city\u2019s Department\nof Finance employees to scrutinize before posting online.\n\nMr. Barreto tried repeatedly to file for a deed, but was rejected over various\ntechnicalities. After his sixth attempt, a clerk told him he needed to contact\nthe sheriff\u2019s office. (In New York City, the sheriff\u2019s office is a division of\nthe Finance Department.)\n\nMr. Barreto said he spoke to a sheriff\u2019s deputy, an investigator in the\ndepartment, who asked why he was filing so many times. He said he responded\nthat he had been given possession of the property but was having technical\ndifficulties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nAt the same time, the hotel\u2019s owners had filed their own lawsuit to evict Mr.\nBarreto, claiming the hotel was exempt from the housing law\u2019s hotel provision.\nUltimately, the lawyers could not produce documentation from May 1968 to prove\nthe hotel\u2019s weekly rate was at the time more than $88 a week. The judge\ndismissed the suit.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Barreto filed for a deed for a seventh time. It was accepted.\n\nOn the afternoon of May 17, 2019, nearly a year after Mr. Barreto booked his\none-night stay, he was identified in ACRIS as the owner of the New Yorker\nHotel, a 1.2 million-square-foot building.\n\nImage\n\nThe New Yorker opened in 1930.Credit...Bettmann, via Getty Images\n\n## Rent Demands\n\nMr. Barreto now had a recorded deed showing he had ownership of the hotel, but\nthe true and only owner since 1976 was still the Unification Church.\n\nMr. Barreto\u2019s next moves went far beyond the rights of a now permanent guest.\n\nHe immediately fired off an email to a lawyer for the hotel, demanding to know\nabout the property\u2019s recent finances, and included a claim that he was owed\n$15 million in profits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThat payment is past due,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand is due immediately.\u201d\n\nA few days later, another demand: The 38th floor needed to be cleared of\nguests. \u201cI need to do an inspection of the building with my architect ASAP,\u201d\nhe said.\n\nThe lawyer quickly responded, \u201cWhat are you referring to?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have ownership rights in that building,\u201d Mr. Barreto replied. \u201cThat\u2019s what\nI\u2019m referring to.\u201d\n\nHe also wrote about wanting to make upgrades, including to the revolving door\nat the hotel\u2019s entrance on Eighth Avenue between West 34th and West 35th\nStreets. \u201cThat area looks like a war zone,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the lawyer scrambled to file a lawsuit to revert ownership of the hotel,\nMr. Barreto sent off an email to Wyndham Hotels and Resorts, which manages the\nproperty, notifying it that he now owned it. A Wyndham representative asked\nfor a litany of legal and sales documents to be sent as proof. (They were\nnot.)\n\nMr. Barreto also sent a memo to M&T Bank, the hotel\u2019s lender, and asked for\nall accounts to be put into his name. (They were not.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nNext, Mr. Barreto walked into the Tick Tock Diner, which is connected to the\nlobby by double doors. He dropped off a letter addressed to the owners.\nMonthly rent checks, he wrote, should be sent to a new address: Room 2565.\n\nOne of the diner\u2019s owners, Alex Sgourgos, recognized Mr. Barreto. Since he had\nmoved into the hotel, Mr. Barreto, along with Mr. Hannan, frequently ate at\nthe Tick Tock, a \u2019round-the-clock restaurant styled as a 1950s diner with neon\nlights, red booths and a laminated menu. The two men often ordered breakfast,\nsandwiches and chicken entrees, Mr. Sgourgos said, and always paid in cash.\n\n\u201cThey looked like strange guys,\u201d he added.\n\nAfter reading the letter, Mr. Sgourgos called the Unification Church, which\ntold him to ignore Mr. Barreto\u2019s demand. The couple continued to eat at the\nrestaurant, he said, and never mentioned the rent payments again.\n\nImage\n\nMr. Barreto and his partner frequented the Tick Tock Diner, a 24-hour\nrestaurant connected to the hotel.Credit...John Taggart for The New York Times\n\nTwo days after Mr. Barreto walked into the Tick Tock, the lawyer for the hotel\nwas in court, explaining the situation and pleading with a judge to issue an\norder to stop Mr. Barreto from representing himself as the owner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe lawyer, Matthew B. Meisel, said his law firm partners had \u201cnever seen such\nan egregious set of circumstances.\u201d\n\nIn court, Mr. Meisel said he believed that Mr. Barreto was under investigation\nby prosecutors in the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office, though he did not\nspecify for what.\n\nAcross the country, it is not uncommon for overworked municipal recorders to\naccept property filings under the assumption that they are legitimate, and for\nreal estate speculators to take advantage of the system.\n\nBut Bill Lienhard, a lawyer who has represented many victims of deed theft in\nNew York City, said he was stunned by the apparent ease with which Mr. Barreto\ntransferred a 41-story Manhattan hotel into his name.\n\n\u201cBoy,\u201d he said, \u201cthis takes the cake for the city\u2019s record department not\npaying attention.\u201d\n\nRepresenting himself in court, Mr. Barreto insisted he had done nothing wrong.\n\u201cAs for me proclaiming to people I was the owner, I only did that after I had\nthe deed,\u201d he said in court.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nA few months later, the judge issued a ruling: \u201cThe subject deed is a forged\ndeed by all accounts,\u201d he wrote. Mr. Barreto did not own the property.\n\nBut that was not the end.\n\nImage\n\nMuhammad Ali in his hotel suite at the New Yorker in 1971.Credit...Don Hogan\nCharles/The New York Times\n\n## In Room 2565\n\nDespite the judge\u2019s ruling about ownership, Mr. Barreto was still a legal\nresident of the hotel.\n\nHis home, Room 2565, is near the end of a long narrow hallway that zigs and\nzags from the elevators. Around the corner is Room 2549, where Muhammad Ali\nspent the night in 1971 after losing the so-called Fight of the Century to Joe\nFrazier at Madison Square Garden.\n\nWith no job, Mr. Barreto said, he spent hours in his room every day,\nresearching his family\u2019s history in Brazil, where he was born and raised in\nthe southern river town of Uruguaiana. He has an angular, youthful face and\nmilitary-style haircut and fidgets with his clothes as he talks.\n\nA relative said that he had excelled in school in Brazil, had never gotten\ninto trouble and moved to the United States in 1990s. As a teenager, he was\nconsidered particularly gifted \u2014 the smartest child in the family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut in recent years, he developed an obsession with his genealogy, claiming to\nhave uncovered a direct connection to Christopher Columbus through Portuguese\nroyalty. In Civil Court, he started to invoke the explorer\u2019s name \u2014 \u201cMy family\nname \u2018Muniz Barreto Columbus,\u2019\u201d he wrote in a 2021 filing.\n\nMr. Barreto also delved into the Unification Church\u2019s origins on the Korean\nPeninsula, its expanding economic interests on other continents and its\nbusiness connections with North Korea. He started to believe that leaders of\nthe church were sending its income, including from the hotel, to North Korea\nin violation of sanctions imposed by the United States.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Barreto said that his concerns about the finances of the\nreligious organization became the main driver for staying in the hotel. He\ncalled it his patriotic duty as an American citizen, likening his efforts to\nsomeone having been able to stop one of the hijackers before the Sept. 11\nattacks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I disrupted your attempt to finance weapons of mass destruction,\u201d\nMr. Barreto said. \u201cIt\u2019s Mickey Barreto versus North Korea.\u201d\n\nWhile Mr. Moon, who died in 2012, was born in what is now North Korea, his\nchurch\u2019s current ties to that country are unclear; it once operated factories\nand a hotel there. The church came under intense scrutiny in Japan after the\n2022 assassination of Shinzo Abe, the former prime minister. The alleged\nkiller believed Mr. Abe had ties to the church, which has long been accused of\npreying on vulnerable people for donations, in Japan and elsewhere.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nMr. Barreto voiced similar claims to relatives, about both the church and his\nfamily\u2019s genealogy, leaving them confused about whether his statements were\ntethered to reality.\n\n\u201cIt was something that was just hard to believe,\u201d said the relative, who asked\nto remain anonymous because of sensitivity within the family. \u201cI was thinking\nmaybe it\u2019s true, I don\u2019t know.

He had access to\nroom service, housekeeping and all the hotel\u2019s facilities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut he refused to sign a lease \u2014 or pay rent.\n\nThe hotel\u2019s first offer of a lease, according to him, exceeded the legal rent\nfor a rent-stabilized room. He also declined additional offers over the years,\nclaiming he was concerned about the church\u2019s finances.\n\nFinally, last year, the hotel\u2019s owner succeeded in court against him. A judge\nruled in the hotel\u2019s favor, citing Mr. Barreto\u2019s refusal to pay or sign a\nlease. He was evicted in July.\n\nEven while that second eviction case had been working its way through Housing\nCourt, Mr. Barreto had not stopped portraying himself as the property owner.\nIn September, he submitted another deed showing that the hotel had been\ntransferred once again into his name, and that the city had accepted it.\n\nThe transfer caused the hotel to lose a property tax exemption, resulting in a\n$2.9 million increase on its property tax bill.\n\nBack in court, the hotel\u2019s lawyers urged a judge to hold Mr. Barreto in\ncontempt, and a judge signaled on Feb. 7 that there would be another hearing\nin the case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nA week later, police officers showed up before sunrise at the apartment on the\nUpper West Side where Mr. Barreto had been staying with Mr. Hannan.\n\nMr. Barreto was arrested and arraigned later that morning in a Manhattan court\non 24 counts \u2014 including 14 felony fraud counts \u2014 in what prosecutors said was\na criminal scheme to claim ownership of the hotel. Mr. Hannan, who Mr. Barreto\nsaid was not involved beyond staying with him at the hotel for much of five\nyears, was not charged or accused of any crime.\n\nMr. Barreto is now awaiting trial in State Supreme Court in Manhattan and\nfacing several years in prison if convicted. In jail before he was released on\nhis own recognizance, Mr. Barreto said he used his one phone call to dial the\nWhite House, leaving a message about his whereabouts.\n\nThere was no reason to believe the White House had any interest in the case or\nany idea who Mickey Barreto was.
