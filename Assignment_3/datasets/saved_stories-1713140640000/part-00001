It comprised relatively slow-moving drones, faster\ncruise missiles and high-speed ballistic missiles capable of travelling\nseveral times quicker than the speed of sound.\n\nThough the attack was well telegraphed, with Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Hossein\nAmir-Abdollahian, saying on Sunday it had given neighbouring countries 72\nhours notice, its size was notable. Roughly three times a large-scale Russian\nassault in Ukraine and comprising over 100 ballistic missiles, the assault was\na serious threat to any air defence system.\n\nIran\u2019s chief of general staff, Gen Mohammad Bagheri, said on Sunday that the\noperation was considered a success and further attacks on its part were not\nnecessary \u2013 but while Tehran will have learned about Israel\u2019s air defences,\nthe apparently low impact rate, particularly from the missiles, is likely to\nbe a disappointment.\n\nBy comparison, the surprise drone and missile attack on two Saudi oil\ninstallations at Abqaiq and Khurais in September 2019, orchestrated by Iran,\ntemporarily knocked out 5% of the world\u2019s oil supply. Estimates vary, but two\nor three dozen drones and missiles were used at the time.\n\n\u201cLook at the size and scale of this latest attack \u2013 this was not a salutary\nmove. It was designed to inflict real damage, but the fact that it didn\u2019t is\ndamaging to Iran\u2019s credibility,\u201d said Sidharth Kaushal of the Royal United\nServices Institute thinktank.\n\nMiddle East crisis: visual guide to Iran\u2019s attack on Israel\n\nRead more\n\nOvernight, international help was critical in eliminating the slower-moving\ndrones: the US said it had knocked out about 70 drones and three missiles. The\nUK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, added that the RAF had intercepted an\nunspecified number. Other reports indicated Jordan, a longstanding US ally,\nhad shot down dozens more drones over its airspace.\n\nWorking together to eliminate drones and cruise and ballistic missiles would\nhave required careful planning, Kaushal added. \u201cThis is complex in every way.\nThe defenders were a multinational force, having to operate in a deconflicted\nway, facing a mixture of weapons with different flight characteristics, from\nslower-moving drones to high-altitude ballistic missiles.\u201d\n\nIsrael\u2019s military said all 170 drones launched from Iran, likely to be from\nits Shahed family, were shot down before they reached Israeli airspace. In\nthemselves, the drones are not much threat, able only to carry a modest bomb\nof up to 50kg, but their intention is to tie up defenders.\n\nVideos of the craft, circulated on social media hours before being shot down,\ngave those responding plenty of time to react. The noisy engines suggested\nthey were the slow-flying Shahed-136, which would take six hours to fly from\nIran to Israel, although some Israeli media reported Iran had launched the\nfaster jet-engined Shahed 238, which travel three times more quickly and whose\nflight time matched the events overnight.\n\nThough the participation of countries other than the US may have been a\nsurprise overnight, there was plenty of time to plan. It is 10 days since the\nUS first warned about a response from Tehran, and the US and UK had been\nmoving military assets into the Middle East to prepare since then.\n\nOn Friday the US said it had shifted assets to the region, but declined to\ngive further details, while the UK enhanced the RAF presence at the Akrotiri\nairbase in Cyprus. Planning was in place at the end of the week, with the\nprime minister, Rishi Sunak, saying on Sunday he had signed off Britain\u2019s\ninvolvement at a Cobra emergency meeting two days earlier.\n\nIsrael said Iran also launched 30 cruise missiles towards its territory, with\nIDF jets intercepting 25 \u201coutside the country\u2019s borders\u201d, according to\nmilitary spokesperson Daniel Hagari. The missiles are most probably the newly\ndesigned Paveh-351, designed to be manoeuvrable in flight but still taking two\nhours from Iran.\n\nThe most serious threat came from high-speed ballistic missiles, capable of\nflying several times the speed of sound and making the journey from Iran to\nIsrael (about 600 miles at the closest points) in less than 15 minutes. More\nthan 120 were launched at Israel, Hagari said, and he acknowledged that \u201ca\nfew\u201d crossed into Israel\u2019s airspace, some striking at the Nevatim airbase.\n\nTackling these was largely the task of Israel\u2019s air defence system, which\nrelies on rockets to hit incoming missiles. Knocking out the ballistic\nmissiles was primarily the task of the Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 systems,\nmanufactured in an Israeli-US collaboration but never used until the start of\nthe Israel-Hamas war, supported by David\u2019s Sling, a medium-range interceptor.\n\nBrig Gen Reem Aminoach, a former financial adviser to the IDF chief of staff,\ntold Israel\u2019s Ynet News that an Arrow missile typically costs $3.5m (\u00a32.8m) a\ntime, and David\u2019s Sling interceptors $1m (\u00a3800,000). Adding up the cost of\neliminating 100 ballistic missiles, plus the costs of the whole air defence\ncampaign, is \u201can order of magnitude of 4 to 5 billion shekels (\u00a3850m to\n\u00a31.1bn)\u201d, he estimated.\n\nHowever, the attack was also expensive for Iran, with ballistic missiles\ngenerally costing upwards of \u00a380,000. The US estimates Tehran had about 3,000,\nthe largest arsenal in the Middle East.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Israel\n  * Iran\n  * Middle East and north Africa\n  * Jordan\n  * Rishi Sunak\n  * analysis\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### \u2018I hope everything is behind us\u2019: Israelis take stock after night of airstrikes\n\n1h ago\n\n  * ### \n\nLive\n\nIsrael will \u2018exact price from Iran ... when time is right for us\u2019, war cabinet\nminister says \u2013 Middle East crisis live\n\n8m ago\n\n  * ### Bullish Iran hails attack on Israel as a success and says operation is over\n\n3h ago\n\n  * ### Middle East crisis: visual guide to Iran\u2019s attack on Israel\n\n3h ago\n\n  * ### Why Israel\u2019s attack on Iranian consulate in Syria was a gamechanger\n\n5h ago\n\n  * ### Iran warns it will strike again with greater force if Israel or US retaliate\n\n11h ago\n\n  * ### Iran launches drone and missile strike against Israel as Biden rushes back to White House\n\n19h ago\n\n  * ### Iran launches hundreds of drones and cruise missiles at Israel in unprecedented attack\n\n16h ago\n\n  * ### Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards seize Israeli-affiliated ship\n\n1d ago\n\n  * ### Iran\u2019s silence over possible reprisals against Israel poses domestic risks\n\n1d ago\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
