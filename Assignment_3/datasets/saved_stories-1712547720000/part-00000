Current infrastructure faces limitations in accommodating large\naircraft, hindering connectivity. Enter Airlander 10, an aircraft that can\nconnect the previously unconnected due to its minimal requirement for fixed\ninfrastructure. This case study looks at the operational infrastructure\nrequirements of the aircraft, showcasing how the incorporation of Airlander 10\ncould reshape transportation in the region, and in similar geographies,\nwithout significant cost.\n\n## The study\n\nTo better understand how Airlander could operate from the current airfield\nnetwork in the Highlands and Islands we worked alongside our partners at\nAECOM. AECOM is the world's trusted infrastructure consulting firm, with\nexpertise that encompasses a wide range of aviation facilities, from terminals\nto runways, hangars, and support infrastructure. In our collaborative effort,\nAECOM's focus was on assessing aerodrome infrastructure for both land and sea\noperations, as well as surface access and obstacle restrictions. Their\ncomprehensive scope included evaluating the cost implications of changes,\nadditions, and interventions at seven locations, supporting the safe and\nefficient operation of Airlander 10.\n\nThe study found that the current airfields are relatively small with low\noperating costs and short runways, meaning only very small aircraft can\noperate out of them. Compared to traditional aircraft, Airlander 10 boasts\nunparalleled operational flexibility. With a short take-off and landing run,\nakin to small light aircraft, Airlander opens the door to a multitude of\nlocations, from small islands to water and ice surfaces.\n\n## Airlander operational infrastructure\n\nAirlander 10 requires a reasonably flat surface to operate from, and unlike\nfixed-wing aircraft it is not restricted to using a single runway orientated\ntowards one particular point of the compass. The study found minimal adaptions\nto the current airfields would be required. These adaptions would increase\ncapacity ten-fold.\n\nMooring the aircraft requires a 200m circle. Of the sites surveyed most could\naccommodate this, of the ones that couldn\u2019t, it would simply mean Airlander\nwould need to be kept overnight at a different site. Aircraft servicing,\nmaintenance and repair can all take place on the mooring mast. Requiring\nminimal specialised infrastructure, Airlander is designed for easy\nmaintenance, eliminating the need for hangar facilities.\n\nThe envisioned Airlander passenger facility echoes an airport setup but with a\nstreamlined, 'turn up and go' approach, featuring simplified security\nscreening. Whether housed in existing buildings or temporary structures, this\nadaptable infrastructure ensures operational cost efficiency.\n\nAirlander's impact is not only transformative but also economically viable.\nThe study and our work with AECOM reveals that the required adaptations for\nAirlander operations are simple and cost effective, with an average\nmodification cost of approximately \u00a3287k per site. This stands in stark\ncontrast to substantial upgrade costs for other transportation hubs. Airlander\n10 offers an innovative solution, poised to reshape transport dynamics in the\nHighlands and Islands, offering unparalleled connectivity without the burden\nof extensive infrastructure investments.\n\nTo delve deeper into the comprehensive findings of our feasibility study,\ndownload the full report here.\n\n### Take me back to news\n\nNews and Media\n\n### Be part of the journey\n\nAirlander Newsletter\n\n### Key information\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Cookie Settings\n\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Sitemap\n\n### Contact us\n\n  * Hybrid Air Vehicles Limited, 239 Ampthill Road, Bedford, MK42 9QG\n  * T +44 (0)1234 336400\n\n### Stay connected\n\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Facebook\n  * Instagram\n  * YouTube\n  * Twitter\n\n\u00a9 Hybrid Air Vehicles 2024.
