A man with two watches is never\n> sure.^[1]\n\nThe mood of the saying is ironic. While at a surface level it appears to be\nadvocating the simplicity and self-consistency obtained by relying on\ninformation from only a single source, the underlying message is to gently\nquestion and make fun of such apparent certainty \u2013 a man with one watch cannot\nreally be sure he knows the right time, he merely has no way to identify error\nor uncertainty.\n\nNevertheless, the saying is also used in its purely surface sense, to caution\nagainst the potential pitfalls of having too much potentially conflicting\ninformation when making a decision.\n\n## History[edit]\n\nSupposedly, the saying was coined by the San Diego Union on September 20,\n1930: \"Confusion.\u2014Retail jewelers assert that every man should carry two\nwatches. But a man with one watch knows what time it is, and a man with two\nwatches could never be sure.\" Later this was \u2014 mistakenly \u2014 attributed to Lee\nSegall of KIXL, then to be misquoted again by Arthur Bloch as \"Segal's\nLaw\".^[2]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * List of chronometers on HMS Beagle\n  * The four-faced liar\n  * Triple modular redundancy in chronometers\n  * wikt:a stopped clock is right twice a day\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Bloch, Arthur (2003).
