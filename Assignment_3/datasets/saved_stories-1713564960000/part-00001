In 1938, he was the\nfirst to show that the land temperature of Earth had risen over the previous\n50 years.^[2] This theory, earlier proposed by Svante Arrhenius,^[3] has been\ncalled the Callendar effect. Callendar thought this warming would be\nbeneficial, delaying a \"return of the deadly glaciers.\"^[4]\n\n## Early life, family and education[edit]\n\nCallendar was born in Montreal in 1898, where his father, Hugh Longbourne\nCallendar, was Professor of Physics at McGill College (now McGill University).\nAn expert in thermodynamics, Hugh Callendar returned to the United Kingdom\nwith his family upon being appointed Quain Professor of Physics at University\nCollege London, before moving on after four years to take up a personal chair\nat Imperial College London.^[5] His children grew up in an intellectually\nfertile environment, with visits at home from various members of the\nscientific elite. When Guy was five he was left partially blinded after his\nelder brother Leslie stuck a pin in his left eye. In 1913 he enrolled at St\nPaul's School, but left two years later following the start of World War I.\nUnfit for war service because of his blindness, he instead went to work in his\nfather's laboratory at Imperial College as an assistant to the X-ray Committee\nof the Air Ministry, where he was involved in testing a variety of apparatus,\nincluding aircraft engines at the Royal Aircraft Factory (later Establishment)\nin Farnborough.^[6] In 1919 he began a course in Mechanics and Mathematics at\nCity and Guilds College (part of Imperial), graduating with a certificate in\nthose subjects three years later. This allowed him to commence full-time\nemployment with his father, working on the properties of steam at high\ntemperatures and pressures.\n\n## Career[edit]\n\nCallendar's professional work on steam and pressure was conducted under the\npatronage of the British Electrical and Allied Industries Research\nAssociation, which represented turbine manufacturers. He later focused on\nresearch into batteries and fuel cells.^[7] Although Callendar was an amateur\nclimatologist,^[2] he expanded on the work of several 19th century scientists,\nincluding Arrhenius and Nils Gustaf Ekholm as a hobby. Callendar published 10\nmajor scientific articles, and 25 shorter ones, between 1938 and 1964 on\nglobal warming, infra-red radiation and anthropogenic carbon dioxide. Other\nscientists, notably Gilbert Plass and Charles Keeling, expanded upon\nCallendar's work in the 1950s and 1960s.^[7]\n\n## Research[edit]\n\nIn 1938, Callendar compiled measurements of temperatures from the 19th century\non, and correlated these measurements with old measurements of atmospheric\nCO_2 concentrations.^[3] He concluded that over the previous fifty years the\nglobal land temperatures had increased, and proposed that this increase could\nbe explained as an effect of the increase in carbon dioxide.^[8] These\nestimates have now been shown to be remarkably accurate,^[2] especially as\nthey were performed without the aid of a computer.^[9] Callendar assessed the\nclimate sensitivity value at 2 \u00b0C,^[10] which is on the low end of the IPCC\nrange. His findings were met with scepticism at the time; for example, Sir\nGeorge Simpson, then director of the British Meteorological Society thought\nhis results must be taken as a coincidence.^[11] However, his ideas did\ninfluence the scientific discourse of the time, which had been generally\nsceptical about the influence of changes in CO_2 levels on global temperatures\nin the previous decades after debate over the idea in the early 20th\ncentury.^[7] His papers throughout the 1940s and 50s slowly convinced some\nother scientists of the need to conduct an organised research programme on\nCO_2 concentrations in the atmosphere, leading eventually to Charles Keeling's\nMauna Loa Observatory measurements from 1958, which proved pivotal to\nadvancing the theory of anthropogenic global warming.^[7] He remained\nconvinced of the accuracy of his theory until his death in 1964 despite\ncontinued mainstream scepticism.^[11]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * History of climate change science\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Charles C.
