We are known\nfor the Arborio and Carnaroli rice that are grown in this area, though no one\never talks about the billions of mosquitos that also thrive in those rice\nfields. Though I've never been, I always thought it would feel a lot like West\nVirginia. When John Denver sings, I think of Piedmont.\n\nLess than two hundred people lived in that village, of which only five or six\nwere about my age. My father was a brilliant, curious man, and the knowledge\nhe loved to share made me the person I am today. But as I got older, I started\nbeing hungry for more. More people, more knowledge, more experiences.\n\nYou see, in remote villages in the middle of nowhere, everything is spread\nout. Your school is 5 kilometres away, your friends are 10 kilometres away,\nand maintaining friendships soon becomes a logistical problem, one which\nsolution was outside of my reach. Socialization could then only happen during\nschool hours, while the rest of my day was spent learning about the world in\nbooks, lonelier than ever. Luckily for me, this is about the time the Internet\narrived in town.\n\nI spent my 14 to 19 doing a lot of late night coding, but more importantly,\nexploring the world through my computer. Community soon followed, when I found\na link to a chat service offered by my Internet service provider. I clicked\none on one random chat room, dedicated to the TV Show \"Buffy the Vampire\nSlayer.\" I never cared about vampires, but here are a lot of kids my age, I\nmight stay a while. And even better for a lonely teenage boy, a lot of girls\ntend to be into vampires.\n\nOn IRC I made my first friends and found my new home. I would spend most of my\nafternoons gossipping, flirting or talking about anything I cared about with\nstrangers. I met my first few girlfriends. Through the Internet, armed with\nmore knowledge than I would ever need, I learned to become independent, make\nsome money and get out from the hamlet, even if only to meet my latest love-\nof-my-life. And in the matter of a few years, I learned to thrive in a\nsolitary existence that hid a rich social life no one really knew about. I was\nlonely, with a ton of friends.\n\nWhen I was 19, I was two thousand kilometres from home, spending a holiday\nwith a girlfriend when my father suddenly passed away. The world came crashing\ndown, as it usually does, until a school friend asked \"hey, would you like to\nmove to Milan? We've got a spare room.\"\n\n\u2042\n\nI am still ambivalent about my first job. Their modus operandi was to hire\njunior computer nerds like me, pay them peanuts and throw them in at the deep\nend. Within a month of getting hired, I was sent away for a week to teach\nLinux systems administration to literal soldiers. It was a disaster. The\nlessons went well, actually, but do not trust a 19-year-old not to be hung\nover from the night before his teaching job. Soldiers are not keen on this\nsort of stuff. Still, when I was put to do more ordinary coding and sysadmin\nwork, I managed to learn at tremendous pace.\n\nIt's in this meat grinder for computer nerds that I met my first good mate in\nthe big city. He's of that charismatic tribe of people for whom making friends\nis just as natural as breathing. Later that night after meeting him I got\nintroduced to his group of friends and in months, my social circle just kept\nexpanding and expanding.\n\nAfter work, unless I was exhausted or felt the need to be on my own, the\ndefault choice was to go spend the rest of my evening at my friend's. He first\nlived in a small flat, and later moved in an artsy, open-space loft, and\nwherever he lived, he always had guests over. Charismatic people always have\nthis entourage with them, and you never know who's gonna pop over to say hello\nand might stay over for dinner. To me, and dozens other, my friend's house was\nthe focal point of an impromptu community. Bring an acquaintance, and there's\na good chance they become a regular. In those evenings some might play video\ngames, another might put on some music, and two other might meet for the first\ntime and strike a lifelong friendship in this ever-flowing primordial soup of\n20-something people just hanging out. These are some of happiest moments in\nlife and my most treasured memories.\n\nI still adored my time alone, in melancholic introversion you might say, but\nonce again, I found peace in this shade between full-on socialization and\nloneliness. All it took, was a place to aimlessly hang out, with other people.\n\nLife is change, and change also came for this community. I am still friends\nwith a lot of them, many more I lost contact with through laziness and\ninaction, but the group dissolved, and we all floated in our separate\ndirections.\n\n\u2042\n\nI am in my mid 30s now, I have moved once again, now to another country, and\nam still the curious introverted person I have always been. But the\ncommunities I have lost haven't been easy to replace. It is now in hindsight\nthat the two places I found home in were either endangered, or an exception to\nthe rule. I have spent a lot of my time on the Internet, but friendship hasn't\nbeen easy to create in this place. Faces scroll by endlessly, and tend to be\nmocking or frowning. Even my childhood friends are so consumed by their modern\nand efficient lives they barely have time to meet for a beer. The Internet is\nall we need to socialise and find community, we keep telling each other.\n\nWhat truly saddens me, as a computer person, is what was once the haven of\ninstant, unprejudiced communication free from any restraint, has\nsimultaneously become the foremost focal point of our lives, while also\nbecoming more isolated than real life could ever be. The vastness of the\nInternet is now reduced to a handful of towers of Babel, where the cacophony\nis incessant, and everybody is trying to shout into the void. If you listen\ncarefully, you might hear them whisper \"I am here. Can anybody see me?\" We are\nso reduced to thinking about practicalities that we have lost any sort of\nvision of what a modern, digital community could and should look like, if this\nis to be where we spend all of our lives.\n\nTeenage kids today do not have any easily accessible, open platforms for\ndiscussion that are not controlled, monitored, rigid but also are not tainted,\nmanipulated and infiltrated. All we have today are islands, that promote\ntribalism if not stagnation, rather than allowing a constant supply of new\nfaces and ideas. 1998 IRC was the secret club that met in the woods, 2024\nDiscord is a stone fortress run by people who make bureaucracy their hobby.\nMost of my younger readers would readily defend their Discord forts, but who\ncan blame them, when this is all you have ever known?\n\nIn real life, neither teenagers nor adults are fortunate enough to enjoy what\nis commonly referred to as a third place, the social setting that's not family\nnor work. When I was hanging out at my friend's, the third place had already\nbeen extinct for a hundred years. As soon as one's school life ends, hanging\nout aimlessly in a sort of club gets replaced by \"doing something\". Let's go\nhave dinner. Let's go to the movies. Sorry, I gotta check my calendar and will\nget back to you. Our in-person socialisation only revolves around spending\nmoney to do something, rather than just sitting with our thoughts, being bored\ntogether. I have always been fascinated by old American movies, where even in\nlarger cities, people would just hang out in their front porch; before you\nknow it, a neighbour would stop to have a beer and a little chat.\n\nThe solution is easy, I've been told. I should just become like my charismatic\nfriend and create my own following, as if everybody was living a fulfilling\nand effortless social life, and somehow I never got the memo.\n\nIt might seem that we are becoming so used to our fractured existence, atomic\nfamilies and cripping loneliness. Yet, if you look where the younger\ngenerations hang out online these days, even to them is apparent that whatever\nwe are doing right now, is simply not good enough, and the hunger for\ncommunity and belonging is stronger than ever. And all we're doing, is\nbuilding yet another Twitter.\n\n\u2190 View all posts\n\n", "frontpage": false}
