If you weren\u2019t, you clicked on the\nlink, downloaded the app, and started exploring.\n\nRemember Clubhouse? Yeah, that social audio app many of us joined during the\npandemic, which had a meteoric rise and fall. Air Chat has a hint of Clubhouse\nin it, but it feels new and different.\n\nIn a post-pandemic era where we crave connection, audio is becoming\nincreasingly important. Podcasts, for example, continue to grow and thrive\ndespite some correction in the markets. It does seem that now is a perfect\ntime for a new social app to enter the game to fill a void. Will Airchat\nrevive the days of social audio and live audio?\n\nLive audio remains popular on platforms like X, but users looking for new\navenues for conversation and content might gravitate to Airchat.\n\n\u201cSocial audio never went away. Apps like Clubhouse died because while they had\nthe social audio component, they didn't really have the social networking of\nthings like Twitter. Since then, Twitter Spaces has been pretty consistent and\ngrowing,\u201d said Adam Soccolich, an entrepreneur who runs The Best of Live Audio\non X. \u201c I think that's where most of the focus and attention of it has been.\nNow with apps like AirChat, I think are really unique because you can still\nbring back that aspect of social audio with the social network and the text-\nbased applications as well.\u201d\n\nFor Soccolich, on X, you have text, but it\u2019s hard to interpret emotion through\ntext. You need to hear it in people\u2019s voices. For him, in video platforms like\nYouTube you get all the emotions and all the audio and video, but some people\njust don\u2019t want to video.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\n### Is Leadership an Art or a Science\n\n### Gmail And YouTube Hackers Bypass Google\u2019s 2FA Account Security\n\n### Apple Confirms Innovative iPhone 16 Pro Upgrade\n\nFor him, however, you go to the other extreme. You do video like YouTube, and\nwhile you get all the emotions and all the audio and all the video, some\npeople just don't want to be on video. They don't want the visuals. But audio\nlends itself as a good medium where you get that expression from people's\nvoices.\n\n## Why Air Chat Was Created\n\nEarly adopters are joining Airchat and testing the waters of this new\nconversational network. This ... [+] is what the apps looks like inside.\n\nCathy Hackl\n\nAirchat comes from the minds of Brian Norgard, Tinder\u2019s former Chief Product\nOfficer, and Silicon Valley fixture Naval Ravikant.\n\nAccording to Norgard, Airchat is not a social network. It is a conversational\nnetwork.\n\nBoth he and Ravikant are extremely passionate about conversation, meeting new\npeople, and talking about interesting things, which seemed virtually\nimpossible on the consumer internet. So, they set out to build an app that\ndoes just that.\n\n\u201cThis is not a broadcast medium. This is a conversational medium. It's very\ndifferent. We haven't seen anything like this, so be advised, there's a lot to\nlearn,\u201d he added via Airchat audio direct message. \u201cEverybody loves to talk to\nnew people, but it is incredibly hard to do so, so it was our design intention\nto try to solve that problem.\n\nWe aim for the product to be simple, intimate, and evocative.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWhat I saw during my time as Tinder's CPO is that people are\ncraving new connections on the internet, and we want to build a new way to\naccomplish this goal.\n\nWe really think civil conversation can bring people together in a time when\nthe world is probably the most divided.\u201d\n\n## Hot Takes From Early Adopters\n\nYou can talk into the app and you can listen and read users' posts.\n\nAir Chat\n\nAs an influx of first adopters joins the conversational network, many of them\nare voicing their opinions about Airchat. From positive reviews about the\napp\u2019s voice recognition and advanced transcription and correction capabilities\nto learning a new UX, most of the early reviews are positive and offer a\nglimpse into how Airchat might find a unique place in today\u2019s tech space.\n\n\"In the expanding landscape of social media and content creation, the new\naudio platform Airchat has ignited a wave of early enthusiasm. Yet, as we\nnavigate its potential, it remains uncertain whether this platform represents\na mere feature or if it embodies a comprehensive solution for modern\ncommunication,\u201d said Greg Kahn, president and CEO of Emerging Tech Exchange\nand co-founder of AI Trail Blazers. \u201cAs Airchat evolves, users may need to\ntread carefully and become ever more vigilant in their choice of words to\nthrive in this dynamic medium.\n\nAir Chat user Dragaan commented on an Airchat thread the following:\n\n\u201cPersonally, I hope this creates a new lane for social media, because public\nvoice memos and storytelling could behave way more differently on here than\nany other app. Every post or reply requires a bit more presence and engagement\nthan typing a few words.\u201d\n\nFor his part, user Ridd, founding designer at Maven and the creator of\ndive.club, thinks the fact that Air Chat is asynchronous can be a big unlock.\n\n\u201cI think when you just have a big open room on X, it's low time to value, and\nit often becomes quite rambly. I bounce out of every live room that I hop\ninto, whereas Air Chat is so much more bite-size, and it's more directly\nconnected to the people that you care about. It\u2019s a little bit more intimate,\nand you're getting deeper access to people that you generally want to hear\nfrom, rather than more topic-based rooms.\u201d\n\nHe highlighted that the asynchronous nature of Airchat also forces people to\ntake an extra 20 to 30 seconds to think about what they're going to say, which\nleads to much more thoughtful, concise replies.\n\n## Timing is Everything\n\nAirchat was started by Brian Norgard, Tinder\u2019s former Chief Product Officer,\nand Naval Ravikant.\n\nAir Chat\n\nWhen Clubhouse became a hit, folks were stuck at home and craving connection.\nWhile we\u2019re out of the pandemic and not stuck at home, we\u2019re craving\nconnection more than ever.\n\nProduct timing can mean everything when launching a new app. Having the\nability to both read and listen to posts is very valuable for users. While\nother apps might have thought about doing this, it might\u2019ve been really hard\nto accomplish and execute a few years ago, but in 2024, the timing seems\nperfect for exploring new conversational mediums.\n\nThe next weeks and months will be critical to Airchat's growth and longevity.\nEarly adopters are already sharing the app with their friends and contacts,\nand podcasters will surely embrace it as a potential extra distribution\nchannel.
