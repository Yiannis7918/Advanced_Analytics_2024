I want to stimulate reflection and invite people to talk, even if\nand precisely because the topic is so uncomfortable.\n\nSince 2018, I have been working more intensively and more explicitly on the\nemergence and persistence of violence in society. How victims become\nperpetrators, of themselves and others, how experiences of violence are passed\ndown through generations and contribute to mental disorders and other\nillnesses. The deeper I delve, the more I realize how important it is for\nsociety in general and peace and human rights movements in particular to deal\nwith this topic openly and broadly. I see this as a logical continuation and\nongoing development of my political engagement.\n\n> \u201cOnly by including mental health in peace work can spirals of violence be\n> broken in the long term and stability promoted.\u201d (Handbook of Peace\n> Psychology)\n\nThe original post was written in German.

A brief summary. #\n\nOn 18.8.22, I register for the xHain Hackerspace\u2019s \u201cGespr\u00e4ch auf der\nLichtung\u201d, a \u201cmini talk festival\u201d, \u201copen to all\u201d, with the proposal to talk\nabout narcissism. In response, they try to ban me from the space and all their\nevents for \u201cunexcellent behavior\u201d. When I point out that for a ban to be\neffective, concrete accusations have to be made and a hearing must be granted,\nI receive no further reply. I therefore assume that the ban is not upheld.\nUnfortunately, I still don\u2019t know what behavior was interpreted as\n\u201cunexcellent\u201d at the time. This was especially painful, since at the time I\nthought the owners of xHain were my friends. I am still hoping for a clearing\nconversation.\n\nIn October, I contacted CCC Awareness seeking advice regarding the ongoing and\npersistent character assassination campaign against me. My e-mail remains\nunanswered to this day. Many months later, on Mastodon, I was told that,\ncontrary to the information on their website, they are only available during\nevents. At 37c3, I renewed my request for conversation, and that I would also\ntravel to meet with someone from their team.\n\nIn the meantime, I\u2019ve been hearing more and more similar stories. On a mailing\nlist of the CCC I send out an invitation on 27.12.22 to get in touch with\nother interested and similarly affected people. This invitation is later\nconsidered a \u201cdisturbance\u201d by the CCC arbitration board. Some members of it\nhave known me personally for many years and I had considered them friends\nalso.\n\nFor the Chaos Communication Camp 2023 I am submitting a presentation. It is\nrejected with generic reasoning (see link). I hear through the grapevine that\nthe lecture and especially me as a person are not welcome.\n\nFor 37c3 I then held a meeting on 23.11.23 registered as a \u201cself-organized\nsession\u201d (with a very positive response by its participants). It was deleted\nfrom the community schedule at around 8.12. without explanation. I have not\nbeen able to find out who is responsible for this deletion. I asked about the\nreasons by phone and accepted the ones given, even though I still don\u2019t\nunderstand them. There was no objection to an external implementation, to the\ncontrary: I was advised to advertise with printed notices, and, without me\nasking, was assured by the person I spoke with that they would \u201cpersonally\nprotest\u201d if notices were removed. (Which is exactly what happened.) As a\nfarewell, I was invited to sit down for a friendly Mate at the c3.\n\nI asked some old-timers (like me?), and they said it\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve\nheard of any self-organized session ever getting removed (apart from obvious\nspam).\n\nFor the upcoming Easterhegg conference, in an attempt to avoid conflict and\nmake arrangements in advance, I have now instead reaped a complete event ban,\nregardless of whether the meeting takes place or not, which hits me very hard;\nEasterhegg has always been my favorite event, and I like Regensburg very much.\n\nI invite you to read the email exchange between the Easterhegg team and myself\nand form your own opinion (German). What do you see?\n\nI didn\u2019t think it would be a big deal. I submit a workshop, people who want to\nparticipate do so, and that\u2019s it. Those who don\u2019t want to simply don\u2019t. Just\nlike with any other topic. I am peaceful and not at all interested in any kind\nof petty wars. I\u2019m interested in constructive cooperation. But I\u2019m not going\nto be fobbed off just like that either. When more and more people are advising\nme to consult a lawyer to defend my rights, it makes me sad. I don\u2019t want to\ntake legal action against my own communities. I want to work together\nconstructively, not against each other.\n\nEven just coming up with the idea of banning someone from an event because\nthey dare to organize a parallel meeting, whether agreed upon or not, shows\nthat people here are far from living and representing the values that I\nassociate with the CCC. Not to mention the responsibility to adhere to the\napplicable legal framework. Even more serious is the categorical refusal to\ntalk, which unfortunately seems to have become a new norm in our circles. This\nis socially highly dangerous behavior.\n\nI have been accused of three things here. Two of them are simply not true, and\nthe third is at best a misunderstanding that could have been smoothed out\neasily.\n\nYes, I assumed - wrongly, as it turned out, after I was banned - that this\nwould be seen and treated in the same way as at c3. You may read a \u201cclear\nrejection\u201d from their team and find the style of clarification okay. I see it\ndifferently. My question as to which statements from the EH Content Team\nshould have made it clear that, in contrast to c3, they were also against any\nexternal implementation remains unanswered to this day. I simply still cannot\nunderstand it. It doesn\u2019t become any clearer by repeatedly emphasizing that it\nwas \u201cclear\u201d. No, it wasn\u2019t. In hindsight, I now realize that I should have\nclarified my plan even more explicitly than I did. I tried. At the same time,\naccusations remain standing that do not correspond to facts, and clarification\nand correction is refused. For example, one could have admitted that they had\nobviously misinterpreted what happened around c3, and that they know too\nlittle about the alleged publication to be able to judge it. That can happen.\nBut then one takes it back and doesn\u2019t insist on it. And when I make my\nopinion known and explain myself, it is seen as a further affront. I therefore\nask explicitly, once again: how can I clarify this? If all avenues are closed\nto me. It is not without reason that I have been asking for professional\nmediation. That seems to me to be the only remaining way of resolving this.\n\nAnd when they say that they agree with the arbitration board \u201cto the full\nextent\u201d, and I point out that this would also mean to agree with their ruling,\nthey claim that I have said that they would be forced to agree with it. This\nis a distortion of my words, another misunderstanding that is being\ninterpreted negatively. I mean what I write, no more, no less. These constant\ninsinuations are irritating.\n\nIn order to be able to respond to concerns, I need to be able to understand\nthem in the first place. If my clarification questions are not answered, it\nmakes it impossible for me. I can only make assumptions and refer to them\ncarefully and cautiously in the hope of gradually learning more. I assume that\nI have not yet understood many things properly, and I think it is wrong if I\nam resented for merely asking questions that are aimed at improving my\nunderstanding.\n\nI am expected to behave perfectly here, but they seem to apply different\nstandards to themselves. Of course, you can be unfriendly and uncomprehending\ntowards \u201csomeone like that\u201d! Someone who dares to criticize specific things\nand wants to improve them is an enemy, from one moment to the next. The\nslightest slip is used as an argument to refuse to engage with me, forever.\nThat\u2019s my experience. In two years, there hasn\u2019t been the slightest attempt to\nlisten to or actually converse with me. And now I\u2019m being unilaterally blamed\nfor the \u201cescalation\u201d. Instead of seeing it as a joint task to resolve\nconflicts. No wonder everything is always \u201cdrama\u201d, with this kind of behavior.\nYou\u2019re blocking yourselves and therefore also my own club out, and that makes\nme sad. It would be helpful if both sides could \u201cshow understanding\u201d and\napproach each other. Telling me to \u201ckeep quiet\u201d and \u201cstop misbehaving\u201d is not\na option. In view of the abuses and procedural errors, I certainly won\u2019t\naccept this. There are always reasons when someone is \u201cacting out\u201d. You should\nzoom in on the reasons, not blame me.\n\nIf something is not received the way I meant it, then I regret it, because\nclarity of speech is important to me. If I have not understood something as it\nwas meant, I also regret it, because mutual understanding is important to me.\nIn both cases, I would expect that the other person is given the opportunity\nto clear up the misunderstanding. That\u2019s how I see it. One can handle this\nprocess completely blame- and guilt-free.\n\nIt\u2019s good that there will be a CCC mediation get-together. I\u2019m looking\npositively to the future and see it as a sign of change back to the kind of\ntogetherness and understanding that used to exist in the club. And I don\u2019t\njust mean that in relation to myself. I can cite dozens of examples by now\nfrom which no lessons have been learned yet. Don\u2019t you wonder why there is\nalways so much \u201cdrama\u201d in the CCC? Why is there a tribunal that passes\nverdicts, in secret, but no reconciliation board? I don\u2019t \u201cexpect\u201d anything\nhere; on the contrary, I have been involved in volunteer structures myself for\nalmost 30 years. Why reject the idea and the offer to help fix issues? I have\na lot to say about myself and other people affected. Why not learn from it,\nand let people implement improvements who have an active interest to do so? It\nmakes far less work for everyone in the long run. Not more.\n\nSo, despite many efforts, I have not yet succeeded in entering into anything\neven remotely resembling a dialog. My offers have been rejected or not\nresponded to at all, my comprehension questions have not been answered. The\nfact that I am now making this public is the consequence of this failure. I\nhereby renew my wish for communication (it is called Chaos Communication\nCongress after all), and also the offer to finance professional mediators if\nit allegedly is so difficult to talk to me (not that anyone even tried).\n\nThe Chaos Computer Club serves as an illustrative example here, simply because\nit is the world of experience in which I have been moving for almost 30 years.\nI consider much of this to be transferable to other groups and communities; I\ndon\u2019t regard the CCC and the observable dynamics in this context as anything\nspecial to the CCC.\n\nThis is the beginning of a \u201cliving document\u201d, with the aim of entering into an\ninteraction. The desire of those affected to discuss these issues is countered\nby the concerns of the community. I will collect and try to illuminate the\nrespective arguments, concerns and needs of the various sides here, as I have\nencountered them so far, and as I interpret them at the present time. It is a\nfurther attempt at a rapprochement. A mediation between what I perceive as\nhardened fronts.\n\nI look forward to every contribution from you as a reader. How do you\nexperience this? Have you had similar or different experiences, in the context\nof the CCC or elsewhere? How do you interpret the reactions? What approaches\ndo you see? What concerns do you share, what others do you have? Can you\nprovide me with explanations so that I can better understand the criticism?\n\nThe stated aim is to take concerns seriously and address them in order to pave\nthe way for a joint approach to what I see as the central social issue of\ninterpersonal violence. So this post is also intended to serve as a reference\nwhenever I encounter recurring concerns, and for others who face the same\nissues in their communities. My hope is also to win over \u201cuntainted\u201d people to\nact as mediators here in order to soften the \u201cfronts\u201d that I and others have\nexperienced and who wish to contribute to understanding on \u201cboth\u201d sides. What\ndoes it take to get into an actual dialog?\n\nIt may also inspire someone to offer such meetings instead of me. They are\nobviously needed.\n\nI am not attacking anyone personally. I am aware that some people may become\neven angrier as a result of this publication. I am grateful for suggestions on\nalternative ways of dealing with the situation, as long as, unfortunately, any\ndirect communication is rejected, no matter how hard I try to de-escalate.\nThis alone shows how much room there is to expand our mediation tools to\nresolve conflicts instead of escalating them.\n\n## Motivation - Why all this? #\n\nFirst of all, there are obviously victims who want to talk about their\nexperiences of violence. And they want to do this in the context of the CCC.\nThey don\u2019t just want to: they are already doing it!\n\nI think it is strictly better to provide a clear framework and an opportunity\nfor exchange for these discussions, which take place anyway, instead of\npromoting the formation of fronts and rumor mills as has been the case up to\nnow. All victims I have had contact with so far are asking for such meetups.\nFor themselves and others.\n\nIt\u2019s also interesting that no one has ever asked me why this desire exists.\nUnfortunately, I have not yet experienced any interest in that regard within\nthe CCC, apart from other victims. We should discuss the extent to which\nalternatives could be created that meet the needs of those affected, and\nsatisfy the respective concerns.\n\nWhat are these needs, what goals are \u201cwe\u201d pursuing? I can think of the\nfollowing: solidarity with each other; sharing experiences about coping\nstrategies and what we have experienced and continue to experience as helpful\nfor us individually; discussing existing support services and those that may\nneed to be created specifically by and for nerds and hackers; collecting\nsuggestions for improving existing structures and then reporting these back to\nthe relevant bodies; offering support to like-minded people; asking for\nsupport, including in very practical matters. Networking. At 37c3, for\nexample, a \u201cnarcissism chatbot\u201d was presented that analyzes sentences for\n\u201cspeech patterns typical of narcissism\u201d. We do not necessarily need to dive\ndeep into our personal painful experiences to have a productive exchange.\n\nDemonstrating, and above all experiencing that you are not alone with your\nexperience, is a very central point. It is also necessary to do this within\nthe respective community, and not in isolation as an individual somewhere\nelse. Many of those affected (still) find it difficult to approach \u201cstrangers\u201d\nwith their experiences, and wish to remain among like-minded people to whom\nthey feel they belong. Can patterns be recognized? How can future victims be\nreached and warned within our communities? All of this is specific to each\ncommunity. We are here to grow and develop together.\n\n> \u201cFriendship is born at that moment when one person says to another, \u2018What!\n> You too? I thought I was the only one.\u2019\u201d (C.S. Lewis)\n\n## An attempt to sketch the dynamics #\n\nComing into contact with the subject of violence can (may? should?) trigger\nstrong feelings. A typical and tragic reaction to avoid these feelings is to\navert one\u2019s gaze, to refuse to engage in a discussion, even to become angry at\nthe person who dares to bring up such topics wanting to talk about them. I can\nunderstand that this is (too) unpleasant for some, and that the mixture of\nanger and fear one feels can lead to a rejection of a topic as a whole and of\neveryone who speaks up about it.\n\nThis is tragic especially because this repression reinforces a dynamic in\nwhich violence is looked away from, people withdraw, and both victims and\nperpetrators are left alone with their experience of violence within the\ncommunity. At a community level, this means that perpetrators do not\nexperience any corrective consequences for their actions and are thus\nreinforced in their strategies, while victims also do not receive any\nnecessary support (secondary victimization). As a result of this dynamic,\nthose affected not only often experience silence and disorientation, but\nunfortunately also (unconscious and unintentional) protection of perpetrators\nby the community.\n\nIn discussions with those affected in the CCC environment, I hear of many such\ntragic interactions, often accompanied by the resulting conviction that the\nCCC is \u201cin the firm hands of narcissists who know how to prevent any\ndiscussion of the topic, and do so consciously and deliberately\u201d. In my view,\nwe should take countermeasures here and engage in clarifying and understanding\ncommunication so that this view does not become even more entrenched. Many\nvictims no longer have any trust in the \u201cawareness\u201d and orga structures, which\ncould actually be there to positively absorb something like this and make an\neffort to be seen as helpful in such moments. I also hear this negative\nsentiment from people who were or wanted to be involved in \u201cawareness\u201d in the\npast, but then gave up in frustration or (from their point of view) were\nforced out. I wanted to talk to members of the awareness team about this and\ntell them about all the negative sentiment I\u2019ve encountered, but so far they\nhaven\u2019t responded to my requests and offers.\n\nI consider this \u201cevil narcissist\u201d perspective to be highly dangerous for our\ncommunity and for society, and would rather interpret negative reactions as\nignorance, overwhelm, and sometimes possibly also as a defensive reaction due\nto own unresolved unfortunate experiences. My own negative experiences and the\nimpressions I have gathered from my exchanges with other victims have led and\ncontinue to lead me to want to discuss in particular how we as communities can\nbetter support and help victims in the future. As soon as we no longer see\nourselves and our own humanity in the other person, we lose the ability to\nsupport them.\n\nThe greater the rejection and lack of understanding, the more I think it is\nnecessary to provide better information and to improve structures.\n\n> \u201cSeeing the beauty in a person is most necessary when they communicate in a\n> way that makes it most difficult\u201d. (Marshall B. Rosenberg)\n\n## Concerns #\n\n### It triggers me, or it could trigger others, and therefore it must not take\nplace #\n\nI call this the \u201c451 argument\u201d, after Fahrenheit 451, where all\n\u201ccontroversial\u201d publications are banned step by step because they could hurt\nsomeone else\u2019s feelings.\n\nThis is a socially highly dangerous and damaging argument, which is why I am\nputting it first. I have already addressed some aspects of this above. You\nsimply cannot make a problem disappear by not talking about it. You are making\nit worse.\n\nOne should take responsibility for one\u2019s own feelings that are merely\ntriggered by the other person. Triggers are a signal that there is still\nsomething old that needs to be processed. Only the person who has been\ntriggered can do this, and, yes, it can be very painful to deal with the hurts\nof the past and finally acknowledge them.\n\nBlaming the other person for triggering you and blocking anyone who triggers\nfeelings in you or shows feelings destroys relationships, both on a personal\nand on a societal level, and stirs up conflict instead of pacifying it. If I\nallow another person to influence my feelings, I give up control over myself\nand my own experience, and become the plaything of the other person, who can\nand will - consciously or unconsciously - \u201ctake advantage\u201d of this.\n\n> \u201cIf you expose a problem, you pose a problem; if you pose a problem; you\n> become the problem. The management of a problem becomes the management of a\n> person. In other words, one way of dealing with a problem is to stop people\n> from talking about it or to make the people who talk about it go away.

We are being told to stop talking about problems or go\n> away.\u201d (Sara Ahmed in \u201cThe Feminist Killjoy Handbook\u201d)\n\n> \u201cThe details that emerge during the course of a crime are mostly repetitions\n> of the perpetrator\u2019s behavior (actions, gestures, verbal expressions) that\n> were experienced during their own traumatic experiences. In addition,\n> profile similarities also include structurally similar locations of the\n> events and the use of comparable weapons (or things with which violence was\n> inflicted). [...] Here, almost identical repetitions of the previous\n> perpetrators\u2019 actions can be found within a highly comparable setting.\u201d\n> (from: G. Fischer et al: Vom Opfer zum T\u00e4ter; translation: DeepL)\n\n> \u201cStrife arises from the attachment function, not, as members tend to\n> believe, from the sensitivity or difficulty of the issues that face them. It\n> is the fusion that makes the subjects or conflict unmanageable, not the\n> other way around.\u201d (Fusion in Relationships)\n\nExciting topic, hope to see more talks and lectures on it!\n\n### Relationship violence is a private issue #\n\nI quote here, an an example: \u201cThe club is not the place to work through\nunhappy relationship experiences.\u201d \u2013 Firstly, that\u2019s not what the meetings are\nabout, and secondly, these are more than just isolated \u201cunhappy relationship\nexperiences\u201d. Even with the most benevolent interpretation, I can only take\nthis formulation to mean that more information is urgently needed here so that\nvictims can receive adequate support and not be met with a lack of\nunderstanding. So this is definitely an incentive, not an argument against it.\n\nAt the meeting at 37c3, for example, a \u201cnarcissism chatbot\u201d was presented, as\nalready mentioned, which analyzes sentences for \u201clanguage patterns typical of\nnarcissism\u201d. We can and want to talk about many things here, and this does not\nhave to directly relate to experiences that may not yet have been processed.\n\nMore importantly, a toxic relationship doesn\u2019t just affect the (usually) two\npeople involved, it affects the entire social fabric. How does a hackerspace\ndeal with this, how does a larger community, like the CCC? There are enough\ntopics and ideas that can and want to be discussed. In the long run, making\ntrivial improvements here will cause less stress for everyone than is\ncurrently the case. Nobody is expected to do more work here. On the contrary.\n\nToxic relationships can also exist between colleagues, or in hackerspaces.\nThere is no need for a \u201clove couple\u201d. I know of several cases of such toxic\nrelationships in various hackerspaces. They almost destroyed the respective\nspaces.\n\n> \u201cEvery unwelcome conflict leaves wounds in the community.

I am of the opinion that one should not completely refuse\ncommunication because this only serves to escalate the conflict. I am of the\nopinion that no one should be banned from an event, nor can they be legally\nbanned, just because they do not agree with the organizers. I believe that\nlegal regulations in this case positively reflect what I think is important in\na democracy: there must be factual reasons for a ban, not just imagined ones,\nand a hearing means interacting with each other, to listen and respond to the\narguments put forward and not simply ignoring them. I am of the opinion that\nyou are allowed to have a different opinion and you are allowed to express it,\nin private and publicly, and that nobody should be subjected to reprisals on\nthe basis of a dissenting opinion. I am of the opinion that no one can or\nshould be prohibited from organizing their own external events parallel to an\nevent. I am of the opinion that none of this is in line with the CCC\nprinciples.\n\nAnd you are free to have a different opinion on all of this.\n\nI am amazed and irritated that we even have to discuss any of this. I thought\nwe\u2019d been through that socially.\n\nThe \u201cbe excellent to each other\u201d degenerates into a weapon as a reproach\ntowards others: \u201cBe excellent to each other - OR ELSE...!\u201d.

I hope you find the professional\nhelp you need #\n\nThis \u201cconcern\u201d does not come across to me as caring. So far, it has always\nbeen accompanied by a total refusal to talk further. Even my request to\nexplain why the person has come to this conclusion, based on which statements\nor behavior on my part, is not followed up. Explain it to me! Let\u2019s talk about\nit! I\u2019m happy if you are concerned about the mental health of your fellow\nhuman beings. But in this form, it comes across as insulting.\n\n> \u201cIf any member acts truly differently, he or she is deemed crazy or bad, and\n> strong united pressure is borne on him or her to change back.\u201d (Fusion in\n> Relationships)\n\n### The title/description is not neutral #\n\n\u201cToxic relationships\u201d and \u201cnarcissistic violence\u201d are common and frequently\nused terms in this context. In my view, the most problematic thing about them\nis that pretty much everyone is now a \u201cnarcissist\u201d and every negative\nrelationship experience is \u201ctoxic\u201d. This makes it difficult for actual victims\nof violence to be heard or taken seriously.\n\nI use these terms deliberately, in order to reach people who are \u201cstuck\u201d in\nthis kind of \u201cenemy image\u201d. They find mountains of material on the internet\nand are left alone with it, or, due to a lack of alternatives, may only\nexchange ideas with others who are also \u201cstuck\u201d. Meetings like the one I\nsuggested and hosted can be helpful here to exchange different perspectives\nand opinions. Someone who has experienced interpersonal violence will simply\nnot be reached by discussion groups on non-violent communication, for example.\nI think the term \u201cnarcissist\u201d is actively harmful, like any other term that\nreduces an individual human being to a category and removes the shared\nhumanity from the interaction. But nobody asked me about my opinion. It is\nsimply claimed that I or the title is \u201cnot neutral\u201d \u2013 whatever neutrality\nmeans here. What would be \u201cneutral\u201d? I would like to know more about how this\nis actually interpreted here.\n\n\u201cViolence\u201d as a term may sound repulsive at first. It is neutral in the sense\nthat it is precise. What someone understands as violence, which forms of\nviolence they see, is obviously subject of different opinions and discussions.\nIf one were \u201callowed\u201d to have them.\n\nI am open to discussions about a more \u201csuitable\u201d title or description text.\nOpinions? Suggestions?\n\nThere seems to be a confusion here. I do not express my attitude, my opinion,\nthrough the use of terminology, but rather who I am addressing. I have not yet\nbeen asked for my opinion. For example, my talk would have been about\ndisplaying and contrasting the different perspectives and definitions of the\nterm \u201cnarcissism\u201d over its existence. This does not require any personal\npositioning.\n\nWhy are speakers, workshop organizers and titles suddenly even required to be\nneutral? This is not asked for any other topic. There will always be someone\nwith a contrary opinion. We meet to respectfully exchange different opinions.\n\n> \u201cIn conflict, both sides have an equally large desire to be taken\n> seriously.\u201d (Marshall B. Rosenberg)\n\n### There is already a lecture on this topic #\n\nSeveral times I was \u201creferred\u201d to buecherwurm\u2019s talk about abusive\nrelationships at Camp23 in German, which I am happy to link here. There was\nalso Ann\u2019s talk on sexualized violence at 36c3.\n\nI would like to quote from the description:\n\n> \u201cBy creating an atmosphere in which people can talk about their experiences\n> of sexualized violence, we can support those affected in dealing with it and\n> contribute to raising awareness overall. Support groups for those affected\n> and awareness groups are one way of empowering those affected by sexualized\n> violence and creating awareness for change. Professional organizations\n> educate, advise and support those affected. Hacking is not only a technical\n> action, but also a political and social action and an interactive action.\n> Let\u2019s hack the taboo of sexualized violence and work together to make our\n> community a better place.\u201d\n\nThis topic is large and complex. This topic is socially relevant. I\u2019ve been at\na lot of events for over a decade, and the argument \u201cthere\u2019s already been a\ntalk about this\u201d would eliminate roughly 98% of all talks. There are many\nfacets that I would like to see examined more closely, and I would like to be\nable to exchange ideas about them too. In my opinion, two presentations are\nfar too few for the massive breadth and importance of the topic.\n\n### An exchange among those affected has a retraumatizing effect on those\naffected #\n\n> \u201cThe affected relatives want to decide for themselves what is good for them\n> and what they want to do in order to continue living. It is impossible for\n> non-affected people to assess what is good for these affected relatives.\n> They have not experienced what the relatives have experienced.\u201d (ANUAS\n> Traumaportal (DE))\n\nSuddenly everyone seems to be an expert on trauma, but when I ask for sources\nand evidence and, as someone interested in trauma, want to enter into a\nconversation and offer sources that elaborate and consider this in a\ndifferentiated way, then unfortunately nothing comes of it. I would like to\ndiscuss this point with other interested parties and exchange ideas. For\nexample, yes, exactly, in the context of a meeting, as we would like to\norganize.\n\nCompare that with any other politically controversial topic. Vegans could\nunsettle meat eaters! Linux User Groups could retraumatize Windows users!\nCyclists endanger the mental stability of car drivers! Cannabis legalization\ncampaigns? Not with us!\n\nTrauma disorders were originally mostly diagnosed and investigated within the\n(US) military context. Affected persons were thrown together as \u201ctest\nsubjects\u201d with other affected personell under de facto coercive measures and\nforced to undergo a military debriefing. The idea was that, as a military\ndoctor, you only had to \u201cdrill in\u201d often enough and again and again, and what\na victim had experienced should be \u201ctold off\u201d until it no longer hurt.\nDrilling questions, trivialisation, questioning the accuracy of experiences.\nThese are retraumatizing elements. See also below in the section on so-called\n\u201ccare\u201d.\n\nWhat has a retraumatizing effect in this context is the renewed coercive\nsituation, the renewed loss of control. The violent situation, which has not\nyet been sufficiently processed, is experienced again. As a \u201csick person\u201d,\nsubjected to the imposed \u201ctherapy\u201d. After all, you want to become \u201chealthy\u201d.\n\n> \u201cthe re-stimulated memory, instead of being a pure repetition of the\n> original event can become a healing experience if the person is aware of\n> some component in the present that is different from the original event, and\n> is experienced as safe and supportive\u201d (Ernest Rossi, quoted by Vivian\n> Broughton in \u201cSteps to understand re-traumatisation\u201d)\n\nIt is certainly helpful to explicitly point out to the participants at the\nbeginning that they can withdraw at any time, that they do not have to\ncontribute or say anything, that they are welcome with all their feelings just\nas they are. It is helpful to have a place to retreat to.\n\n\u201cRe-traumatization\u201d should be clearly distinguished here from another danger:\nnamely that victims \u201cget stuck\u201d in an \u201cenemy image\u201d and so \u201cdon\u2019t find their\nway out of their victimhood\u201d \u2013 but instead feel powerless together. In my\nopinion, the danger is much greater if you leave them alone, especially in\ntimes when the internet is full of hostile image material and thousands of\nquestionable paid support offers from \u201clife coaches\u201d and \u201cnarcissism experts\u201d.\nThis is precisely where an exchange in such rationally anchored circles as the\nChaos Computer Club is helpful. At least it can\u2019t make things worse than they\nalready are. Incidentally, it\u2019s an insinuation that I would let this happen as\na moderator. I have prepared myself well, use appropriate moderation tools and\nmake it clear in the intro that I will use them.\n\n  * HFOVN: Self-help groups for victims of narcissistic abuse (DE), in \u00fcber 40 St\u00e4dten\n  * CoDA: Co-Dependents Anonymous, self-help groups in over 60 countries\n  * BBK (federal association of health insurance companies in Germany) guidelines on self-help groups for mental health problems (DE)\n\nDid anything bad happen at 37c3? On the contrary. It was very nice and\nharmonious for everyone involved.\n\nThis leads well to the next point:\n\n### We cannot guarantee safety #\n\nIt\u2019s great when people are concerned about their mental health and support\nservices are created. However, it is ugly in any context when decisions are\nmade under the guise of \u201ccare\u201d and not even involving the recipients. This\nbrings back unpleasant memories of coercive situations, especially for those\naffected by violence, and can have the opposite effect. Nobody wants anything\nto be decided for them, and certainly not against their own declared will.\n\u201cYou\u2019re sick, you can\u2019t decide for yourself.\u201d \u2013 that makes you sick.\n\nVictims experience it as an important step back towards autonomy and self-\nefficacy when they are \u201callowed\u201d to decide for themselves what is good for\nthem, and what they want to put themselves through. This is a fundamental\nelement of \u201chealing\u201d. Nobody is forced to come to such a meeting or to stay\nthere. It is helpful to address all these aspects clearly at the beginning in\norder to emphasize the options for action and offers of help \u2013 and then to\nplace them in the hands of the person concerned. I consider anything else to\nbe intrusive.\n\n> \u201cIn the history of professional help, a merciful or corrective, controlling\n> attitude prevailed for centuries (cf. M\u00fcller 2013): Welfare primarily served\n> to keep social structures stable and force misfits to conform. Those who did\n> not conform were excluded from the community. Enabling people to lead a\n> self-determined life was neither desired nor intended. They had little\n> influence on decisions and were expected to be grateful for the help they\n> received. This type of help and paternalism exacerbated the dependence of\n> those in need of help on state support and increased the feeling of\n> helplessness. Even today, people seeking support often encounter\n> paternalism: \u201cA homeless person should spend the money they beg for on food,\n> not on beer and cigarettes! Why does a welfare recipient need internet\n> access?\u201d\n>\n> The more modern successor to controlling care pedagogy is paternalistic\n> expertocracy. It corresponds to the view that a professional knows better\n> than the person concerned what is good for them due to their qualifications.\n> For example, it seems legitimate to curtail the self-determination of\n> recipients as long as it serves their well-being. The paternalisticx\n> pertocratic attitude is still widespread in the practice of social\n> professions and contradicts the participatory understanding of the\n> profession: here, the recipients are experts in their own right who know\n> best what is helpful for them. Their lifeworld expertise (further\n> information on lifeworld expertise on page 25) is considered just as\n> important as the specialist knowledge of the professionals.\u201d (from:\n> Stra\u00dfburger, Rieger, Partizipation kompakt; translation: DeepL)\n\nNot everyone who has experienced violence is post-traumatized. Anyone who does\nnot feel able to take part in such a meeting will not attend.\n\nThe indication that you have thought about this and are unfortunately not in a\nposition to provide additional support is certainly welcome. But here too, I\nwould recommend that you first ask those affected what support they would find\nhelpful, or make suggestions. You don\u2019t need to know anything, because the\npeople concerned know best what they need. Just ask them. That will be\nreceived very well.\n\nCare and support can only be offered and developed together with the\nrecipients, not \u201cprescribed\u201d. Then it is no longer support, but a patronizing\norder from above, from the \u201chealthy\u201d to the \u201csick\u201d, from the \u201ccompetent\u201d to\nthe obviously \u201cincompetent\u201d.\n\nOf course, we have thought about really helpful forms of support and prepared\nourselves for possible scenarios. In federal states where this exists, this\ncan be the social psychiatric service in emergencies, for example. Lists of\nlocal on-call services and therapists are made available. If desired, a\ntherapist could also be informed in advance and be available \u201con call\u201d. Would\nit address this point if we did this?\n\nThe meeting at 37c3 was deliberately held at a distance from c3, with plenty\nof space, peace and quiet and opportunities to retreat. This will continue to\nbe the case. We\u2019ll take care of ourselves! We would of course be delighted to\nreceive offers of support and interest in how you can do something good for\nus. Why don\u2019t you bake us a cake?\n\n### That doesn\u2019t belong here thematically #\n\nThis argument is surprising. The CCC traditionally covers a very wide range of\ntopics and interests without any restrictions. Everything that is of interest\nto the community members is welcome. Especially in the self-organized\nsessions. But especially topics that have a broader relevance for communities\nand a political dimension for society.\n\nI would be interested to hear the reasons why this is not considered\n\u201crelevant\u201d. On the other hand, it is simply thrown around as a fact, as if it\nwere obvious. It is not clear to me. Please enlighten me.\n\n### You lack the necessary qualification #\n\n1.) In over 25 years of data protection activism, I have given dozens of\nspecialist lectures, co-chaired an academic symposium, appeared on the\nTagesschau and many other formats as an \u2019expert\u2019, would have supervised a\ndoctoral student if Covid hadn\u2019t intervened, been offered various jobs and\nresearch positions, and so on and so forth. And all this as a university drop-\nout. Not that anyone ever asked about it.\n\nThis statement is also surprising because the CCC is traditionally very\ncritical of \u201cqualifications\u201d in the form of degrees and certifications. The\nCCC is a declared \u201camateur club\u201d. It is about sharing and growing together,\nwithout arbitrary barriers such as \u201cqualifications\u201d, which tend to express\nwhich social class someone comes from, rather than knowledge, experience or\nsimply an interest in the topic. Nowhere have I claimed to be an expert on\nanything. I don\u2019t presume to be.\n\nMy \u201cworkshops\u201d so far have been meetings for those affected by those affected.\nA wide variety of formats are conceivable (and I am open to suggestions), but\nI deliberately chose this format to support networking among those affected\nand to find out what people want to talk about with each other and what topics\nare in demand. This also corresponds to the wishes of those I have spoken to\nso far. We want to exchange ideas, explicitly as non-experts or as experts\nthrough being affected. The purpose of self-help groups is discussed in\nanother section below. And not every meeting between those affected is a self-\nhelp group. And not every self-help group is a therapeutic self-help group.\nNot every meeting of coffee nerds is a support group for coffee addicts. Yes,\nit is helpful to make this explicitly clear at the beginning of the meeting,\nto draw a line between the two, and to moderate the whole thing carefully so\nthat it doesn\u2019t get out of hand. I\u2019m allowed to get together with other\nalcoholics at CCC events and get drunk, but not talk about violence? Who keeps\nan eye on those drunks, and with what \u201cqualifications\u201d?\n\n2.) Who is there from \u201cour circles\u201d who has the appropriate qualifications and\nwould like to accompany something like this? When weighing up the options, it\nshould be borne in mind that many people (still) only feel comfortable among\n\u201cequals\u201d, especially when it comes to such topics. And we also want to discuss\ncontent that is specifically related to the club. Perhaps someone can be found\nvia this call who would like to play the front woman here instead of me, who\nenjoys the trust of those affected and can show \u201cqualifications\u201d?\n\n3.) In response to this expressed concern, I have offered to get specialists\ninvolved. See e.g. the Easterhegg mail thread. At least this argument should\nhave been resolved by that. This offer was not taken up, and not commented. If\nyou encounter this argument in a similar situation, please contact me and we\ncan talk about a possible cost absorption. This argument should not hold\nanyone back from organizing such meetings.\n\n4.) What qualification would meet the requirements? I am an MHFA mental health\nfirst aider, am currently training to become an \u2019empathic coach\u2019 on NVC basis,\nI am starting training in identity-oriented psycho-trauma therapy in March, I\nam doing a \u2018basic qualification in psychotraumatology\u2019 certified by the German\nSociety for Psychotraumatology, Trauma Therapy and Violence Research (GPTG)\nbefore Easterhegg, and am doing a certification in Process and Embodiment\nPsychology (PEP) in summer. Or would a non-medical practitioner for\npsychotherapy be \u2018desirable\u2019 (Heilpraktiker)? In some communities this might\nbe an \u201cadvantage\u201d, but I assume that alternative practitioners are taken even\nless seriously in CCC circles... Or should it be a psychological\npsychotherapist or even just doctors/psychiatrists? What do you want? Let me\nknow and I will do my best to recruit the right people.\n\n### You lack the competence #\n\nFirst of all, it\u2019s interesting that I\u2019ve only come across this as a statement,\nand not as a question. This raises the question as to the basis on which\nsomeone thinks they can judge this. I would be really interested to know.\n\nFor many years now, hardly a week goes by in which I am not accompanied in the\nprocessing of unpleasant memories and am allowed to accompany others. I am\naware of the responsibility that a confrontation with such topics means for an\nevent organizer, the attention required to one\u2019s own limits and the limits of\nthe other person, the importance of being present and exclusively there for\nthe other person, and how central the systemic therapy\u2019s \u201cmission/mission\nclarification\u201d and the considered use of methods and tools are. See also the\n\u201cQualifications\u201d section.\n\nHow do you know from the outset what skills I have? Aren\u2019t the participants\nusually allowed to decide for themselves? What criteria are used to assess\nthis competence in advance? Where can I take the competency test? I had\noffered, for example, that someone who would like to assess this could attend\nthe meetings. The offer has not yet been taken up.\n\nDo I not have the competence of an affected person?\n\nDo I not have the competence of being able to read and summarize?\n\nDo I not have the competence to hold an opinion?\n\nDo I not have the competence of trust - In contrast to committees such as the\nOrga, Content Team and Awareness, I enjoy the trust of other people concerned,\nand can therefore contribute to an understanding between the different \u201ccamps\u201d\nthat do not (want to) communicate with each other.\n\nDon\u2019t I perhaps do have the competence to give talks, organize events and lead\nworkshops, and perhaps even to a certain extent to responsibly accompany\nconflicts and psychological emergencies? Should I collect relevant\ntestimonials or references, will that help? Do you want a CV? Testimonials\nfrom people I have accompanied in mental health emergencies, and who keep\nthanking me for how \u201ccompetent\u201d I was?\n\nAnd again: Offers to address this issue by involving \u201cexperts\u201d were rejected.\n\n### You don\u2019t have the necessary emotional distance #\n\n### As a victim, you are not qualified to talk about it #\n\nNo victim is ever allowed to open their mouth again?How should someone else\ntalk about something they have not experienced?Where do the \u201cexperts\u201d get\ntheir \u201cspecialist knowledge\u201d from? When am I no longer a victim? Are there\neven people in our societies who have not experienced violence? Do we perhaps\nhave a different concept of violence?\n\nFor example, I was told by the Easterhegg orga that it was \u201cobvious from your\npublic statements that you do not have the necessary personal distance to the\ntopic\u201d. I can\u2019t do anything with this feedback as long as I\u2019m not specifically\ntold which statements of mine are being referred to here, how they deduce that\nI don\u2019t have the \u201cnecessary distance\u201d, and why they even consider it a\nrequirement to have a distance to be allowed to talk about it or act as a\nmoderator. I would like to be able to understand this.\n\n### You want to use this as a stage to make an attack against your own\nperpetrator #\n\nFirst of all, that\u2019s an insinuation. How can I defend myself against an\ninsinuation? How am I supposed to prove that I\u2019m not doing something if I\u2019m\nnot even given the opportunity to do so?\n\nI could also submit a tie-dye workshop and then just brazenly use it as such a\n\u201cstage.\u201d Or a lighting talk about DIY shoe polish, and instead \u201crag on\u201d my ex-\nfianc\u00e9e. But I don\u2019t want to do that. I never have. I don\u2019t even know where\nthat comes from. Please provide me with a single statement I\u2019ve made in the\npast or present in which I \u201ctrash-talk\u201d my ex-fianc\u00e9e. Or about anyone else. I\nhaven\u2019t, I don\u2019t want to and I won\u2019t do that.\n\nMy point is that, from my experience, the CCC community completely failed\nhere, didn\u2019t react adequately and didn\u2019t support the both of us. And not just\nin our case, but in many before that. Every failure is also an opportunity to\nlearn something from it, to identify the weaknesses and mistakes, and to do\nbetter in the future. That\u2019s my point. I believe that I am not only allowed to\nadhere to this opinion, but also to express it publicly. You don\u2019t have to be\nof my opinion or agree with it. I am happy if this results in a constructive\nexchange of opinions. I ask you to ask me what went wrong, and then we can\ndiscuss together what we can learn from it and what concrete conclusions can\nbe drawn.\n\nSo far, I have only acted as a moderator at the meetings, even though I would\ncertainly like to talk about my personal experiences. The fact that I don\u2019t do\nthis, and exclude it from the outset through the chosen format, is above all a\nconcession to this concern. Because it is more important to me to offer a\nforum at all. My talk would be general on the different perspectives on\nnarcissism. I didn\u2019t intend to go into my own personal experience.\n\nAs already mentioned, the offer to have someone \u201cmonitor\u201d this operational\nprocess was rejected or, as usual, simply not addressed.\n\nOtherwise, that is correct. I am a living (and vivid) reminder that I and my\nthen fianc\u00e9e were victims of a so-called toxic relationship. There\u2019s nothing I\ncan do about that. With that argument, victims should never open their mouths\nagain.\n\nAnd when I look at the usual manners in the club, e.g. on chaos.social and in\nmany lectures, I\u2019m surprised that anyone still gets a stage with this\nargument...\n\n### You have made mistakes #\n\n> \u201cSome other red flags we\u2019ve noticed that are common in leftist spaces\n> specifically: [...] Appeals to opsec to shut down criticism. E.g. decrying\n> public accounts of their abuse as \u201cdoxxing,\u201d or claiming that screenshots of\n> their abuse are a violation of opsec, when in reality being able to take\n> screenshots can be necessary for victims so they can counter gaslighting in\n> the future. Security culture is meant to protect the vulnerable from state\n> abuse, not to protect abusers from their victims\u201d (Punch Up Collective)\n\nI have been and continue to be accused of various things. In most cases, it is\nnot even a case of statement against statement, but the facts could be checked\nand corrected. Anyone who refuses to do so and at the same time clings to\naccusations is contributing to continued damage to my reputation.\n\nIt is also the case that I receive these accusations in a distorted form and\nusually only through several channels. But I can\u2019t show any insight anyway and\ncan\u2019t ask for an apology for something I didn\u2019t do. A correction and a focus\non the facts would be close to my heart. I have asked repeatedly and in\nvarious forms not to believe the rumors that continue to circulate\nuncritically, but to get in touch with me and at least give me the chance to\ncorrect them. Now again at this point.\n\nWhen I encounter this argument, I have always tried to find out what I am\nactually being accused of, to respond to it on the basis of facts and to ask\nwhat I can actually do to make amends. It leaves me disoriented that no such\npath is shown to me. What did I \u201cdo wrong\u201d from the other person\u2019s point of\nview? How could I have \u201cdone it right\u201d? What can I do now?\n\nAm I forever persona non grata from now on? For me, this is in serious\ncontradiction to the self-image and principles of the club. The CCC\nArbitration Board, as a body specifically set up for such cases, has dealt\nwith the accusations against me (while at the same time my references to the\nclearly refutable misrepresentations of the other side were not addressed). In\nmy opinion, their \u201cverdict\u201d should be the final verdict (Non bis in idem). If\nyou are interested in the details, I can provide you with my statement to the\narbitration board and their \u201cjudgment\u201d. You can also speak to the person of\ntrust I elected in the proceedings, a former board member of the CCC.\n(Incidentally, my questions as to why the arbitration board did not adhere to\nits own procedures in this case remain unanswered even after repeated requests\nfor clarification).\n\nThere are actions that I regret. I do not claim to have never made any\nmistakes or to make any more. I would like to apologize, and I am making this\npublic once again. Unfortunately, I am denied any communication. I consider it\nimportant to allow people to make mistakes and to learn from their mistakes.\nTo show them a way to participate in the community again. Without permission\nto make mistakes, a society stagnates and is ruled by fear. I want to learn,\nand share, about how we, and how I, can do a little better in the future.\nProblems don\u2019t go away if you don\u2019t talk about them. On the contrary.\n\nWhenever I come across this argument in this context, it doesn\u2019t seem to me to\nbe about understanding exactly what happened and why, whether I show any\ninsight or how to deal with it now and in the future. There is no discussion\nof what the other party said or did, and what I reacted to. One seem to have\npicked up something here without knowing or caring about details, and is now\nusing it every time as an argument that I can\u2019t do anything about. I would\nexpect people to be willing to separate facts from allegations, conjecture and\nmisunderstandings, in order to resolve this once and for all. And to engage in\na dialogue. To demand that whenever someone makes allegations. I have still\nnot been granted this.\n\n> \u201cAversion to conflict is aversion to relationship.

We are welcome to\ndiscuss them. When do you stop with data protection activism, for example?\nThere will always be surveillance.\n\nAs an activist, it has always been important for me to maintain an appropriate\nbalance and to look to the future with confidence and hope. It\u2019s nice to make\na positive contribution to the world together with others. I\u2019m not doing this\nfor myself: this child has already fallen into the well. It has already\nfailed.

I (also) want to curb the production of waste.\nThe production of new victims, who potentially become new perpetrators. To\nlook at the roots. And I want to network and exchange ideas with others who\nsee it the same way.\n\nIt seems that I have not yet succeeded in getting my point across clearly: We\nhave a structural problem here that is not being addressed by Awareness and\nthe Arbitration Board, but tragically is being fueled by them. You can\u2019t\nimprove something like this by \u201chelping in the background\u201d. The processes must\nbe improved and the dynamics of toxic relationships need to be taken into\naccount. Conflict resolution mechanisms are nowhere to be seen. Improvements\nneed to be made here.

They could retraumatize Windows users!\u201d. \u201cTor Relay Operator Meetups?\nWhy don\u2019t you help those affected by surveillance in the background?\u201d\n\nInterestingly, there seems to be an awareness of the problem itself, otherwise\nthere wouldn\u2019t be such invasive intervention and blocking, right? Otherwise\nthey would just let me do it. (!)\n\n## Conclusion #\n\nOn the one hand, it is emphasized how sensitive the topic is, on the other\nhand, I experience a lot in the communication on the topic that reminds me of\nmy experiences of violence: statements are misrepresented or misinterpreted\nwithout a chance to correct them, insinuations are made and assumptions are\npresented as facts without checking or correcting them, clarifying\nconversations are refused, there are simply no more answers, and so on. And\nit\u2019s all my fault anyway. OK. Everything is my fault. Can\u2019t they still respond\nto my questions and arguments? Not just let me and those who want to do so?\nWhat\u2019s the problem with that?\n\n> \u201cAn argument always has three sides: a good one, a bad one and a comical\n> one.\u201d (Karl Valentin)\n\nIt is certainly not without comedy how the exact linguistic means often used\nhere are what we want to discuss at the meet-ups, and which can be seen as\nviolence and a central part of manipulative toxic behavior. In this sense,\nexactly such an exchange takes place, only on the practical, tangible level,\nand not on the meta-level. Here, others are prohibited from exchanging\ninformation about the very techniques that are used in the \u201cjustification\u201d for\na ban. That is the tragic-comic side of this debate.\n\nIf you are really concerned about those affected and want to protect them from\nfurther negative experiences, then this is where you should start. We,\nincluding me, also express our needs through our wishes. We want to be seen\nand heard and experience understanding. Just like every other person. I would\nbe delighted if, in future, \u201cunaffected\u201d people were to join in and show\nsolidarity when they experience such \u201cdefensive reactions\u201d in their dealings\nwith others. Many people are not able to defend themselves well in some phases\nof their lives and would like your support.\n\nI can only see two possible explanations: Either you are deliberately and\nsystematically protecting perpetrators of violence \u2013 actually also victims,\nand ultimately not doing anyone any favors \u2013 or you are acting wrongly out of\nignorance and excessive demands. I want to continue to believe in the latter\n(Hanlon). Let\u2019s work together to reduce ignorance and the resulting excessive\ndemands. It would be easy to make small changes to the structures here in\norder to achieve far-reaching improvements. I can\u2019t understand why people are\nstonewalling so aggressively here and prefer to accept the constant \u201cdrama\u201d\nand thereby create it in the first place. There is absolutely no discussion\nhere about what is really at stake. What have we experienced as those\naffected? What suggestions for improvement do we have? Can we get to the\nactual point?\n\nIf we are already unable to deal with interpersonal conflicts in our own\ncommunities in a constructive and peace-building way, then we do not need to\nfantasize about making a positive contribution to society anywhere else.\n\nI don\u2019t think that refusing to talk and blocking away are compatible with the\nclub\u2019s principles. And I certainly don\u2019t think that attacking me just because\nI have an opinion is. Regardless of whether you like or share my opinion or\nnot.\n\n> \u201c\u2018Power-over\u2019 tactics include punishment, reward, guilt, shame, duty, and\n> obligation.
