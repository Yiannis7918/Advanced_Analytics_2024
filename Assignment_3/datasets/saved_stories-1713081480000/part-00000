On Thursday,\nthe storage firm announced plans to demo the product in person next week.\n\nWestern Digital will launch the SD card, which follows the SD Association's\nSecure Digital Ultra Capacity (SDUC) standard, under its SanDisk brand and\nmarket it toward \"complex media and entertainment workflows,\" such as high-\nresolution video with high framerates, using cameras and laptops, the\nannouncement said.\n\nThe spacious card will use the Ultra High Speed-1 (UHS-1) bus interface,\nsupporting max theoretical transfer rates of up to 104 MB per second. It will\nsupport minimum write speeds of 10 MB/s, AnandTech reported. Minimum\nsequential write speeds are expected to reach 30 MB/s, the publication said.\n\nWith those specs, the upcoming SD card should be able to fit storage-hungry\nvideo formats, including 8K, although the card won't be speedy enough to\nsupport raw 8K video recording. That helps explain why Western Digital is\ninitially previewing the offering at The National Association of Broadcasters'\nannual event for broadcast and media professionals, which starts tomorrow in\nLas Vegas.\n\n\"Attendees will get a preview of the 4TB SD card\u2019s full capacity and learn\nmore about how it will expand the creative possibilities for cameras and\nlaptops,\" Western Digital said.\n\nHopefully, Western Digital will provide more information about the SD card at\nthe event, as this week's announcement didn't go into further details, such as\nthe type of NAND the card will use or whether it will support the SanDisk-\ncreated DDR200/DDR208 mode, which could enable higher data transfer speeds of\nup to 170 MB/s (but only with a host that supports that mode).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWestern Digital didn't say what the SD card would cost, but with its advanced\ncapabilities and targeted audience of professional creators, the offering will\nlikely have premium pricing. The 1TB SanDisk Extreme Pro SDXC UHS-I Card\ncurrently has a $140 MSRP.\n\nWD's announcement comes six years after the SD Association, which writes SD\nstandards, announced the SDUC standard that bumped the max possible capacity\nfor SD cards from 2TB to 128TB. As with many releases of new standards, some\nwere eager to believe that \"SD cards could soon hold 128TB of storage.\" But\nwith 4TB not expected to arrive until 2025 (assuming there are no delays),\n\"soon,\" even today, is unrealistic. The 2018 standard only made such\ncapacities a possibility. At the time, the max theoretical capacities for an\nSD card had been 2TB for about nine years, but the most spacious SD cards\nactually available for purchase at the time were 512GB.\n\nToday, the highest capacity SD cards readily available are 1TB (Western\nDigital also this week announced plans to release a 2TB SanDisk Extreme Pro\nSDXC UHS-I memory card at an unspecified date), while 2TB microSD cards only\nbecame available this year.\n\nWith Western Digital's announcement, the industry inches closer to SD cards'\nmaximum potential. For professionals with high-storage needs, that's exciting\nnews, as having more capable technology opens more possibiltiies, like working\nwith high-res media.\n\nHowever, Western Digital's announcement also comes as SanDisk's reputation for\nreliable storage is in serious question by professional and long-time\ncustomers. There are multiple lawsuits about SanDisk Extreme portable SSDs\nreportedly failing unexpectedly. These alleged failures, combined with\nfrustration around Western Digital's limited response to reported data losses,\ncould have professionals with work-critical storage needs consider waiting for\nanother brand to make the leap to 4TB.\n\n#### reader comments\n\n114\n\nScharon Harding Scharon is Ars Technica\u2019s Senior Product Reviewer writing\nnews, reviews, and analysis on consumer technology, including laptops,\nmechanical keyboards, and monitors.
