Brokers say the ease with which rogue\nagents can get into policyholder accounts in the 32 states served by the\nfederal marketplace plays a major role in the problem, according to an\ninvestigation by KFF Health News.\n\nIndeed, armed with only a person\u2019s name, date of birth, and state, a licensed\nagent can access a policyholder\u2019s coverage through the federal exchange or its\ndirect enrollment platforms. It\u2019s harder to do through state ACA markets,\nbecause they often require additional information.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s rampant. It\u2019s horrible,\u201d said Ronnell Nolan, president of Health Agents\nfor America, a nonprofit trade association representing independent insurance\nbrokers.\n\nThe growing outcry from agents who have had their clients switched by rivals \u2014\nwhich can steer monthly commissions to the new agent \u2014 casts a shadow on what\notherwise has been a record year for ACA enrollment. More than 21 million\npeople signed up for 2024 coverage.\n\nFederal regulators are aware of the increase in unauthorized switching and say\nthey have taken steps to combat it. It\u2019s unclear, though, if these efforts\nwill be enough.\n\nOn Feb. 26, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services sent a \u201cplan switch\nupdate\u201d to industry representatives acknowledging \u201ca large number\u201d of 2024\ncases and outlining some of its technical efforts to resolve problems when\ncomplaints are lodged.\n\n\u201cCMS is committed to protecting consumers in the marketplace,\u201d said Jeff Wu,\ndeputy director for policy for CMS\u2019 Center for Consumer Information &\nInsurance Oversight, in a written statement to KFF Health News.\n\nHis office refused to provide details on how many complaints it has seen or\nthe number of agents it has sanctioned but his statement said when action is\ntaken, CMS reports it to state insurance departments, whose authority includes\nrevoking licenses.\n\nWu did not answer specific questions about whether two-factor authentication\nor other safeguards would be added to the federal website, though he wrote\nthat CMS is \u201cactively considering further regulatory and technological\nsolutions to some of these problems.\u201d\n\nIn June, new rules kicked in that require brokers to get policyholders\u2019\nwritten or recorded verbal consent before making changes, although brokers\nsaid they are rarely asked for those documents.\n\n#### Email Sign-Up\n\nSubscribe to KFF Health News' free Morning Briefing.\n\nFinding Out the Hard Way\n\nSome unwitting enrollees, like Michael Debriae, a restaurant server who lives\nin Charlotte, North Carolina, not only end up in plans they didn\u2019t choose but\nalso bear a tax burden.\n\nThat happens when enrollees are signed up for coverage that includes premium\ntax credits paid by the government to insurers, even though the enrollee is\nineligible, either because their income was misstated by the broker making the\nswitch, or they had job-based insurance, like Debriae.\n\nUnbeknownst to him, an agent in Florida with whom he had never spoken enrolled\nhim in an ACA plan in March 2023. It was two months after he canceled his\nObamacare coverage because he was able to get health insurance through his\njob. In June, he discovered he had a new ACA policy when his longtime pharmacy\nsaid it could not fill a 90-day prescription, which it had done with no\nproblem in the past.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I realized something horribly wrong had happened,\u201d said Debriae.\n\nDebriae got contact information for the Florida broker, but when he called,\nthe office said the agent no longer worked there. He filed a complaint with\nthe federal marketplace and canceled the plan. But he still owed the IRS part\nof the $2,445 in premium tax credits paid to the insurer from March until July\non his behalf.\n\nTo be sure, some switches could be legitimate, when enrollees choose a\ndifferent broker or plan. And agents do have a vested interest in raising the\nissue. They lose out on commissions when their clients are switched by other\nagents. But brokers whose clients have been switched through unauthorized\ntransactions say the real losers are consumers.\n\n\u201cPeople literally losing their plans is fraud, absolute fraud, not a squabble\nbetween agents,\u201d said Leslie Shields, an insurance broker in Fort Worth,\nTexas.\n\nPatients\u2019 new plans might not include their doctors or might come with higher\ndeductibles than their former coverage. Because the agent on the policy is\ngenerally switched, too, enrollees don\u2019t know whom to call for help.\n\n\u201cYou have surgeries that can\u2019t happen, providers that can\u2019t be seen, or have\nbeen changed,\u201d said Shields. \u201cIt\u2019s happened in the past, but now it\u2019s\nliterally the worst I\u2019ve seen.\u201d\n\nEase of access to policyholders\u2019 accounts on the federal marketplace is a\ndouble-edged sword, agents say: It aids enrollment, but also makes it easier\nto switch plans without consent.\n\n\u201cThose bad eggs now have access to all this private information about an\nindividual,\u201d including household income, Social Security numbers, and\ndependents, said Joshua Brooker, a broker who follows the issue closely as\nchair of a marketplace committee for the National Association of Benefits and\nInsurance Professionals, a trade group.\n\nComplaints gained momentum during the most recent open enrollment period,\nagents say. One worker in a government office that helps oversee operations of\nthe federal exchange told KFF Health News of personally handling more than\n1,200 complaints about unauthorized switches or enrollments in the past three\nmonths, averaging about 20 a day. About 30 co-workers are working on similar\ncomplaints. It can take multiple days to resolve the most urgent cases, and\ntwo to four weeks for those deemed less urgent, the worker said.\n\nFlorida, Georgia, and Texas appear to be plan-switching hotbeds, agents say.\nFlorida and Texas officials referred questions to federal regulators. Bryce\nRawson, press secretary for the Georgia Department of Insurance, says the\nstate saw no switching complaints last year and has about 30 so far in 2024, a\nsmall number but one it is taking seriously: \u201cIt\u2019s still an active and ongoing\ninvestigation.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, states that run their own marketplaces \u2014 there are 18 and the\nDistrict of Columbia that do \u2014 have been more successful in thwarting such\nefforts because they require more information before a policy can be accessed,\nBrooker said.\n\nIn Colorado, for example, customers create accounts on the state\u2019s online\nmarket and can choose which brokers have access. Pennsylvania has a similar\nsetup. California sends a one-time password to the consumer, who then gives it\nto the agent before any changes can be made.\n\nAdding such safeguards to healthcare.gov could slow the enrollment process.\nFederal regulators are \u201ctrying to thread a needle between making sure people\ncan get access to coverage and also providing enough of a barrier to capture\nanyone who is coming in and acting nefariously,\u201d said Brooker.\n\nHow Does It Happen?\n\nMany people have no idea how they were targeted, agents say.\n\nJonathan Kanfer, a West Palm Beach, Florida, agent, suspects names and lists\nof potential clients are being circulated to agents willing to bend the rules.\nHe said his agency has lost 700 clients to switching.\n\nThe agents doing the switching \u201cdon\u2019t care about the people,\u201d Kanfer said,\nonly the money, which can amount to a monthly commission of roughly $20 to $25\nper enrollee.\n\n\u201cTwo weeks ago, someone telemarketed me, gave me a number to call to get leads\nfor Obamacare,\u201d said Kanfer, who turned down the offer. The person told him:\n\u201cYou don\u2019t even have to speak with the people.\u201d\n\nOnline or social media advertising is a way some outfits troll for prospects,\nwho then end up on lists sold to brokers or are contacted directly by agents.\nSuch lists are not illegal. The problem is the ads are often vague, and\nconsumers responding may not realize the ads are about health insurance or\nmight result in their policies being changed. Such ads promise free\n\u201csubsidies\u201d worth up to $6,400, often implying the money can help with\ngroceries, rent, or gas. Some do mention \u201czero-dollar\u201d health insurance.\n\nYet agents say the ads are misleading because the \u201csubsidies\u201d are actually the\npremium tax credits many people who enroll in ACA plans are eligible for,\nbased on their income.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re portraying it like it\u2019s money going into your pocket,\u201d said Lauren\nJenkins, who runs an insurance brokerage in Coweta, Oklahoma, and has seen\nabout 50 switching cases in recent months. But the money goes to insurers to\noffset the price of the new plan \u2014 which the consumer may not have wanted.\n\nAmbetter Health \u2014 a division of Centene that offers ACA plans in more than two\ndozen states \u2014 sent email alerts to brokers in September and November. One\nnoted a jump in complaints \u201cstemming from misleading advertisements.\u201d Another\nwarned of \u201ctermination actions\u201d against bad actors and directed agents not to\ncollect consumer information or consent via \u201conline forms or social media\nads.\u201d\n\nIn response to the switching, Ambetter also instituted a \u201clock\u201d on policies\nstarting at midnight on Dec. 31, meaning the agent on the policy by that\ndeadline would remain on it for all of 2024, according to an email the insurer\nsent to brokers.\n\nResults are mixed.\n\nAdam Bercowicz, a licensed independent broker in Fort Lauderdale, Florida,\nsaid he and his staff worked New Year\u2019s Eve, monitoring their client lists and\nwatching as some were switched before their eyes.\n\n\u201cIf I saw one of my clients was stolen from me at, let\u2019s say, 11:57 p.m., I\nput myself back on,\u201d said Bercowicz, who estimates he\u2019s had 300 to 400\npolicies overtaken by other agents not connected to his staff in recent\nmonths. \u201cAnd by 11:58 \u2014 a minute later \u2014 they were already switched back.\u201d\n\nJulie Appleby: jappleby@kff.org, @Julie_appleby\n\n### Related Topics\n\n  * Health Industry\n  * Insurance\n  * Medicare\n  * California\n  * Colorado\n  * Florida\n  * Georgia\n  * North Carolina\n  * Obamacare Plans\n  * Oklahoma\n  * Pennsylvania\n  * Texas\n\nContact Us Submit a Story Tip\n\nShare This Story:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Email\n  * Print\n  * Republish This Story\n\nWe want to hear from you: Contact Us\n\nRepublish This Story\n\n### Copy And Paste To Republish This Story\n\n# ACA Plans Are Being Switched Without Enrollees\u2019 OK\n\nBy Julie Appleby April 2, 2024\n\nWe encourage organizations to republish our content, free of charge.
