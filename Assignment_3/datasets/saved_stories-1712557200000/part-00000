They can certainly adapt to language\nmodels.\n\nArvind Narayanan\n\nOct 21, 2022\n\n34\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Students are acing their homework by turning in machine-generated essays.\nGood.\n\nwww.aisnakeoil.com\n\n15\n\nShare\n\nThe latest AI-related alarm: students around the world are using AI models\nsuch as GPT-3 to write essays, and getting good grades on them.\n\nI don\u2019t condone cheating. But I think the availability of text generators will\nforce changes to education which, while painful, will prove to be positive.\n\nConsider the threat once posed by the calculator to homework that involved\narithmetic. In some cases, the point of such exercises is to learn arithmetic\nor mathematical principles through practice. Teachers mostly shifted those\nexercises to the classroom, and prohibited the use of calculators in that\nsetting.\n\nIn other cases, homework involved tedious arithmetic, but this was entirely\nincidental to the learning goals of the exercise (which might be about, say,\ngravity). After initial reluctance, teachers recognized that it was pointless\nto make students do these manually. Back when I was in high school, we were\nforced to use log tables out of the mistaken belief that there is pedagogical\nvalue in doing tedious calculations by hand. Mercifully, log tables have now\njoined the abacus.\n\nThe same changes are likely to play out with language models. In some cases,\nthe point of assigning an essay is to teach writing skills or critical\nthinking. The availability of language models has not obviated these skills.\nTo prevent cheating on this type of exercise, instructors could move them to\nthe classroom. Even better: there are many ways to change the exercise so that\nthe tools aren\u2019t helpful. These changes take advantage of inherent limitations\nof language models that are unlikely to be fixed soon.\n\nIn other cases, essays are pure tedium. In fact, it seems to be this kind of\nessay where language models are doing particularly well, with assignments such\nas \u201cWrite five good and bad things about biotech\u201d. As an educator, I think\nthis assignment is close to useless if the goal is to learn about biotech. Nor\ndoes it teach critical thinking. It\u2019s the equivalent of the log-table drudgery\nI once faced. If these types of essays are no longer viable, good riddance.\n\nThe beginning of an essay generated by GPT-3. via OpenAI Playground.\n\nThe adjustment will be painful, for sure. The reason instructors assign mind-\nnumbing essays isn\u2019t callousness or incompetence. It\u2019s usually because\nteachers and adjunct professors are underpaid and overworked, and it\u2019s far\neasier to ask for \u201cfive good and five bad things\u201d rather than to design a\nquestion that requires reasoning and fosters learning. And the more tedious\nthe essay, the easier to grade, because it\u2019s enough to scan for keywords.\n\nThese are deep and long-standing problems with our educational system. AI\ntools didn\u2019t create them and banning their use by students won\u2019t solve them.\n\nUpdate: In the comments, Professor Timothy Burke points to the book Why They\nCan't Write: Killing the Five-Paragraph Essay and Other Necessities exploring\nthe widespread pedagogical misuse of writing for teaching subject matter (as\nopposed to writing skills and critical thinking), as well as his own analysis\nof the issue.\n\nYou\u2019re reading AI Snake Oil, a blog about the upcoming book.

Essays have\nbeen reduced to nothing more than mindless busy work. The existence of chat-\nGPT now forces teachers to come up with better formative and summative\nassignments. For instance teachers can have students read a novel, have them\ncreate a creative piece to show understanding, and than instruct students to\nwrite a short essay expressing their overall experience of the process. In\nthis scenario, if students choose to use chat-GPT, it will most likely be used\nmore as an assistant rather than a full on cheating tool.Expand full\ncommentLike (1)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nJess H. BrewerOct 21, 2022Calculators spawned several generations of people\nwho still can't make change without their electronic device. Cellphones\nspawned several generations of people who can't read a map or spell. Okay,\nthose skills may be unnecessary now. But as long as writing ability remains\nthe single most important skill for a career in science, having an AI write\nyour essays is a big mistake. Essay assignments in English should be like,\n\"Write an essay of at least N words on a subject that matters to you.\" If you\nmust dictate a topic, just point out that the grade will depend on relevance\nto the most recent course material.
