Most software doesn't use too many mmaps\nthat the 65k default is plenty suitable for the vast majority of user-space\nsoftware out there. But there are a few Windows games running on Linux via\nSteam Play (Proton), that limit can actually be exceeded -- DayZ, Hogwarts\nLegacy, Counter Strike 2, and other games.\n\nTo enhance the out-of-the-box experience for Linux gaming and other software,\nvarious Linux distributions have been increasing their default\nvm.max_map_count threshold. In the case of Arch Linux they are now going ahead\nand bumping the value from 65,530 to 1,048,576. As announced today on the Arch\nLinux mailing list:\n\n> The vm.max_map_count parameter will be increased from the default `65530`\n> value to `1048576`.\n>\n> This change should help address performance, crash or start-up issues for a\n> number of memory intensive applications, particularly for (but not limited\n> to) some Windows games played through Wine/Steam Proton. Overall, end users\n> should have a smoother experience out of the box with no expressed concerns\n> about potential downsides in the related proposal on arch-dev-public mailing\n> list.\n>\n> This `vm.max_map_count` increase is introduced in the `2024.04.07-1` release\n> of the filesystem package and will be effective right after the upgrade.\n\nThe sysctl vm.max_map_count threshold can still be overrode by the user if so\ndesired.\n\n2 Comments\n\nRelated News\n\nArch Linux's Pacman 6.1 Released With Cache Server Support\n\nArch-Based Endeavour OS Updates ISO With Linux 6.7 Kernel, Mesa 23.3.3\n\nArch Linux Will Now Use Dbus-Broker As Its Default D-Bus Daemon\n\nManjaro 23.1 Released With Linux 6.6 LTS, Pipewire 1.0 & Desktop Updates\n\nArch Linux ALHP Adds x86-64-v4 Repository For Packages Built With AVX-512\n\nArchinstall 2.7 Brings Unified Kernel Image Support To The Arch Linux\nInstaller\n\nAbout The Author\n\nMichael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site\nin 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.
