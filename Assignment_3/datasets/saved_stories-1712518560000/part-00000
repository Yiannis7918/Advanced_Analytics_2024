Now, a combination of new\ntechniques, government support and the pressing need to secure continuous\nclean power in an era of climate crisis means that geothermal energy is\nfinally having its moment in the US.\n\nUntil recently, geothermal has only been viable where the Earth\u2019s inner heat\nsimmers near the surface, such as at hot springs or geysers where hot water or\nsteam can be easily drawn to drive turbines and generate electricity.\n\n\u2018Our contribution to a cleaner world\u2019: How Kenya found an extraordinary power\nsource beneath its feet\n\nRead more\n\nWhile this has allowed a limited number of places, like Iceland, to use\ngeothermal as a main source of heating and electricity, it has only been a\nniche presence in the US, providing less than 1% of its electricity. But this\ncould change dramatically, offering the promise of endless, 24/7 clean energy\nthat can fill in the gaps of intermittent solar and wind generation in the\nelectricity grid.\n\n\u201cGeothermal has been used for over 100 years, limited to certain geographic\nlocations \u2013 but that is now changing,\u201d said Amanda Kolker, the geothermal\nlaboratory program manager at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).\n\n\u201cAs we penetrate the grid with renewables that are not available all the time,\nwe need to find a base load, which is currently taken up by gas. There aren\u2019t\nreally many options for zero-emissions base load power, which is why\ngeothermal is entering the picture.\u201d\n\nGeothermal capacity could increase 20-fold by 2050, generating 10% of the US\u2019s\nelectricity, according to a recent road map released by the US Department of\nEnergy. Joe Biden\u2019s administration has also funded new projects aimed at\npushing forward the next generation of geothermal that aim to make the energy\nsource available anywhere on America\u2019s landmass, not just easy-to-reach hot\nsprings.\n\n\u201cThe US can lead the clean-energy future with continued innovation on next-\ngeneration technologies, from harnessing the power of the sun to the heat\nbeneath our feet, and cracking the code to deploy them at scale,\u201d said\nJennifer Granholm, the US energy secretary, who added that she saw \u201cenormous\npotential\u201d in geothermal.\n\nExpanding the geothermal footprint to the entire US will take time, as well as\nplenty of money \u2013 the department of energy estimates as much as $250bn will be\nneeded for projects to become widespread across the country, providing a major\nsource of clean power.\n\nBut advocates of geothermal say that such growth is within reach, because of a\nwave of geothermal technologies as well as government support. In February,\nthe Biden administration announced $74m for up to seven pilot projects to\ndevelop enhanced geothermal systems that, the government said, hold the\npotential for powering 65m American homes.\n\nIronically, enhanced geothermal uses similar fracking techniques currently\nused to extract oil and gas, which must be phased out if the world is to avoid\nclimate disaster. In the geothermal version of fracking, fluid is injected\ndeep underground, causing fractures to open up, with the liquid becoming hot\nas it circulates. The hot water is then pumped to the surface, where it can\ngenerate electricity for the grid.\n\nThis, and other new techniques that allow deeper and horizontal drilling, in\nsome cases down to eight miles deep, allows geothermal energy to be drawn from\nhot rocks found anywhere underground, rather than select spots that have hot\nwater near the surface. This vastly expands the potential of the technology.\n\n\u201cAnywhere in the country, if you drill, it gets hotter and hotter with each\nmile you go deeper,\u201d said Koenraad Beckers, an NREL thermal sciences\nresearcher.\n\n\u201cIn the western United States, that temperature increases fast. If you drill\njust one to two miles deep, you have temperatures hot enough for electricity.\nTo get those temperatures in eastern states, you might need to drill miles and\nmiles down, but you can use lower temperatures to directly heat or cool\ncampuses, neighbourhoods and even towns.\u201d\n\nDozens of new companies are looking to push ahead with geothermal plans,\nbuoyed up by incentives offered by recent legislation passed in the US,\nalthough only a few have so far managed to complete full projects in the US,\nsuch as Eavor, a Canadian firm that successfully drilled a three-mile hole in\nNew Mexico to prove it could access heat in deep, granite rock.\n\nAt play for these companies is an inexhaustible energy supply. Just one type\nof next generation geothermal \u2013 called superhot rock energy, where deep\ndrilling reaches temperatures 400C or hotter \u2013 is abundant enough to\ntheoretically fulfil the world\u2019s power requirements. In fact, just 1% of the\nworld\u2019s superhot rock potential could provide 63 terawatts of clean firm\npower, which would meet global electricity demand nearly eight times over.\n\n\u201cWhile this modelling is preliminary, our findings suggest an enormous\nopportunity to unlock vast amounts of clean energy beneath our feet,\u201d said\nTerra Rogers, the director for superhot rock energy at Clean Air Task Force,\nwhich produced the modelling tool to measure the potential of this approach.\n\n\u201cEnergy security backed by always available zero-carbon energy isn\u2019t a far-off\ndream.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Geothermal energy\n  * Energy (Technology)\n  * Energy (Environment)\n  * Renewable energy\n  * Energy efficiency\n  * Energy research\n  * Climate crisis\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Environment\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Wildlife\n  * Energy\n  * Pollution\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
