In addition, we\nhave agreements in place with all model providers that further limit how they\ncan use data from these anonymous requests that includes not using Prompts and\nOutputs to develop or improve their models as well as deleting all information\nreceived within 30 days.\n\nOur general Privacy Policy also applies here. If there is a conflict with our\ngeneral Privacy Policy, this AI Chat Privacy Policy applies.\n\n# Terms of Service\n\n## You retain all intellectual property rights in your Prompts and Outputs.\n\nWe claim no ownership of either your Prompts or Outputs. You grant us a\nlimited intellectual property license permitting us only to process your\nPrompts and provide you the Outputs consistent with our Privacy Policy. You\nrepresent and warrant that you have all necessary rights and permissions to\ninclude any personal data or third-party content in your Prompts.\n\n## Outputs may be inaccurate, incomplete, or otherwise unreliable.\n\nBy its very nature, AI Chat generates text with limited information. As such,\nOutputs that appear complete or accurate because of their detail or\nspecificity may not be. For example, AI Chat cannot dynamically retrieve\ninformation and so Outputs may be outdated. You should not rely on any Output\nwithout verifying its contents using other sources, especially for\nprofessional advice (like medical, financial, or legal advice).\n\n## Outputs may be offensive.\n\nOutputs don't represent our views.\n\n## AI Chat is only intended for and available to people who are age 13 or\nolder.\n\nIf you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction you must have your\nparent or legal guardian's permission to use AI Chat.\n\n## The models accessible through AI Chat are subject to the model provider's\nusage policies. Broadly, that means that using AI Chat for illegal, harmful,\nregulated, and sexually explicit purposes is prohibited.\n\nAI Chat allows you to use models from leading model providers without being\ntracked. These model providers have usage policies, and our Terms therefore\nmirror those policies. For example, usage policies from Anthropic and OpenAI\napply to their respective models.\n\nAccordingly, it is a violation of these Terms to use AI Chat for anything:\n\n  * Illegal or harmful to others, including generating hateful, harassing, or threatening content, or using Outputs for anything fraudulent or deceptive.\n  * Violating other's rights or property, including privacy and intellectual property rights, creating spam, malware, computer viruses, or gaining access to computer systems without authorization.\n  * Sexually explicit or obscene.\n  * With high risk of physical or economic harm, including designing weapons, explosives, or other dangerous materials, or promoting multi-level marketing, gambling, or sports betting.\n  * In a regulated area, including providing legal, financial, or medical advice or services, political campaigning or lobbying, determining eligibility for financial products or creditworthiness, housing (leases and home loans), employment, or more generally for governmental decision-making, such as law enforcement or immigration decisions.\n  * Interfering with or negatively impacting AI Chat or other DuckDuckGo Services, including automated querying and developing or offering AI services, such as training an AI model.\n\n## Safety features created by model providers may try to prevent you from\nmisusing AI Chat.\n\nTo avoid misuse, model providers embed safety mechanisms to block certain\nPrompts and the generation of certain Outputs.\n\n## If you break the law or violate these Terms when using AI Chat for\ncommercial purposes and we get sued, you may have to take responsibility.\n\nYou agree to indemnify and hold harmless DuckDuckGo, its affiliates,\nemployees, and any other agents from and against any claims, losses, and\nexpenses (including attorneys' fees) arising from or relating to your use of\nAI Chat for commercial purposes, including your subsequent use of any Outputs,\nyour breach of these Terms, or violation of applicable law.\n\n## We will notify you when these AI Chat Privacy Policy or Terms are updated.\n\nWe will notify you of changes by posting the modified version at\nduckduckgo.com/aichat/privacy-terms.
