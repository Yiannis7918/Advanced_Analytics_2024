Since this accumulation is performed by hand, pages are saved\nbecause they had an effect on the users who saved them. The goal is to find\nsomething that has an effect on you.\n\nThis collection of curious content saved to Are.na channels or posted on\nHacker News is a trove of handcrafted treasures. But as our habits have taught\nus in the contemporary era of web surfing, we are prone to doomscrolling (and\neven doom-bookmarking).\n\nMoonjump makes a decision for you by selecting something random from a deep\nsea of unconventional content. Results may be peculiar, profound, or absolute\nnonsense. But you can always close the tab and jump again.\n\nThe search engine is powered by Marginalia, a project which indexes non-\ncommercial content and may surprise you with sites you perhaps weren't aware\nof. Search queries on Moonjump use the Marginalia API to redirect you to a\nrandom result.\n\nTo jump to a random site from Are.na or Hacker News, click the links above the\nsearch bar. Otherwise, click on the large logo to jump blindly.\n\nLearn more tricks and contribute on GitHub:\n\nya1sec 2022\n\n", "frontpage": false}
