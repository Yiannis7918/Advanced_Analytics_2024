A new article series\n\n## Introduction, and why I am starting this series\n\n*1\n\nThe purpose of this series is to look at developers, writers, designers, etc.\nof popular games to see where they are now and what they have made in the\ndecades since their \u201cprime.\u201d I am starting off with the Deus Ex development\nteam because Deus Ex is one of my all-time favorite video games due to its\nphilosophical narrative, immersive gameplay(especially for the time), and\nfunny moments. It remains, to this day, to be the most interactive experience\nthat I have ever had in a game.\n\nIts a masterclass in game design, and the people who worked on it have gone on\nto work on other projects. I feel like it would be great to highlight these\nprojects, so that people can see where \u201cthe people have gone\u201d and showcase\ntheir lesser known \u201cnew works.\u201d\n\nupdate 4/19/23 it was pointed out to me that Alexander Brandon did not compose\nHuman Revolution, and I corrected my mistake. He is credited in the game\nbecause he worked on a single track in the \u201cbob Page ending\u201d and I mistakenly\nthought he did more than thatsource\n\n## Director\n\n### Warren Spector\n\n*2\n\nThe director of Deus Ex was Warren Spector. He is a legend in the video game\nindustry. The titles/series most famous with his name attached are:\n\n  * Wing Commander\n\n  * System Shock\n\n  * Thief: Deadly Shadows(he left this title before completion, but he had considerable influence over the direction of the project)\n\n  * Ultima Series\n\n  * Epic Mickey\n\n  * And of course, Deus Ex\n\nIn October 2023, he wrote an article detailing his story for his 40th\nanniversary of game design. He is working on a new project called Argos:\nRiders on the Storm, but has kept his lips tight as to what kind of game this\nis. Hopefully he will knock it out of the park, and really amaze us. Only time\nwill tell. From his most recent statement as of this article, it seems as\nthough it will be a multiplayer immersive sim. I am not big on multiplayer,\nbut considering how games such as Helldivers, Left 4 Dead, Deep Rock Galactic,\netc. have taken the world by storm it might work. I always thought of the\nimmersive sim as a single-player only genre, but if he can pull this off it\nmight truly be something worth playing.\n\nHe has two blogs, currently. One is Junction Point which was put to rest. You\ncan read his old articles there, but he has since migrated to his new site,\nGaming the System.\n\n## writers\n\nDeus Ex had three main writers. Sheldon Pacotti, Chris/Robin Todd, and Austin\nGrossman.\n\n### Sheldon Pacotti\n\nSheldon Pacotti was the head writer of Deus Ex, and according to his website\nhe wrote most of the main script. Some of his works include Gamma which is a\nbook with an eerily similar sounding plotline to Deus Ex, Demiurge which is a\nbook in which all material reality has been transferred to the digital world,\nand Experiments in Belief. Of these three, Experiments in Belief is the only\none that is readable for free.\n\n  * books\n\nExperiments in Belief is a collection of short stories written by Sheldon from\n1990 to 2000, and they touch on cyberpunk themes such as dependence on\npharmecuiticals, immortality, and similar. Its not all cyberpunk, but I can\nsee why he was hired to write the project. It is free, and I think most of the\nstories are worth reading.\n\nDemiurge is a novel written in 1996, but there was a new edition written in\n2000 and another in 2014. I have not read it, but I am going to purchase it\nand write a review in a few weeks as time allows. From the description, it\nseems to ask the question \u201cwhat would life look like if you could copy\nanything, even physical objects and people, for free? What would that do to\nsociety?\u201d It looks like a real brain-scratcher and I can\u2019t wait to pick it up\nand read it for myself. He offers it on Kindle and Nook, but also a copyright-\nfree pdf for about six dollars.\n\nGamma is a book written in 2016, and takes place in a world where a new race\nof humans, the \u201ctransgenic race\u201d are designed by biotech companies. Again, I\nhave not yet read the book but I will be getting it and reviewing it along\nwith Demiurge. From the Summary on his website alone, the book sounds a LOT\nlike Deus Ex. Designer babies with enhanced abilities? Nanotechnology pushing\nhumanity into an advanced but dangerous future? Sounds extremely familiar. I\nwill definitely be picking this one up.\n\n  * Games and software\n\nSheldon wrote a few pieces of software as well. A game called Cell Emergence\nthat uses voxels, Game Blocks which is a game engine for 2d games, and Story\nLanguage which is a programming language for writing stories.\n\nCell Emergence has a free demo to check out. The full version is six dollars.\nJust like some of his previous work, it deals with themes of nanotechnology.\n\nGame Blocks is free, but it is built for Scratch which I am not a fan of,\npersonally.\n\nStory Language doesn\u2019t seem to be accessible. All links, including the ones on\nhis official page, seem to be completely dead. I suppose Sheldon decided\nagainst making it public? Or perhaps it was accidentally deleted? This is a\nshame. I don\u2019t see how a programming language would work for storytelling, but\nit would be interesting to see the attempt.\n\nAs for his professional works, his moby games page doesn\u2019t have him listed on\nmuch. He recieved thanks on a few immersive sim games, but it seems that in\nthe AAA game development sphere, he has only worked on Deus Ex 2 as a lead\nwriter, and Little Strategy as a proffreader.\n\nDespite not doing much in the AAA game market since Deus Ex, he has been a\nbusy guy. I hope when I am his age, I will have made half as many creative\npersonal projects as he.\n\n### Chris/Robin Todd\n\nChris Todd, now Robin Todd, was the writer that put together all of the data\ncubes. While their role in the writing of Deus Ex was not quite as important\nas Sheldon Pacotti\u2019s, datacubes usually reinforced the themes of Deus Ex, and\nincluded both fictional and real-life novels. He wrote flavor text to give the\nworld a lot more color, and he also included excerpts from G.K. Chesterson\u2019s\nbook \u201cThe Man Who Was Thursday\u201d which includes several themes included in Deus\nEx.\n\nIt is also important to note that they wrote the dialogue for the intro and\noutro cutscenes for the game(spoilers for the outro cutscenes, naturally).\nOriginally they worked on Wing Commander 3source as a programmer.\n\nThey did have a personal website titled 7crows.com, but that site seems to be\ndown at the moment. The latest snapshot on the wayback machine is on June 16,\n2014. And really, you have to go back as far as 2012 to see anything besides a\nTwitter link. Not really sure why the site got taken down, but it seems a\nshame to me. With blogs, you can express yourself much more freely than on a\nsocial media website, for better or worse.\n\nSince Deus Ex, Robin has since worked on games such as Redfall and Destiny 2\nas a producer, and worked on the MMO Star Wars: The Old Republic. Moby Games\nlists their role as Production Team though I am not sure what that means.\nAdditionally, they worked on Freelancer as a designer. source\n\nAs for their other creative works, I could only find sources on their old\nsite, 7Crows. The main creative works they seem to have worked on solo are the\ncomic Seraphim and Cyberpunk: The Seraphim Files. It seems they tried\npublishing a book called I Buy My Time Secondhand but I cannot find anything\nabout it outside of the announcement on 7crows, so I assume it just never got\npublished since their article said it was \u201cunder consideration.\u201d There is an\nauthor on Goodreads called Chris Todd, but that author has published under\nthat name even after Robin\u2019s transition, and there seems to be no correlation\nwith Robins work, so I assume that it is a different person altogether.\n\n### Austin Grossman\n\nAustin Grossman worked on some of the dialigue of Deus Ex, and when looking at\nhis personal website, him and Warren Spector seem to work on a lot of the same\ngames and series. He wrote for games such as Dishonored, Dishonored 2,\nNeverwinter Knights 2, and Ultima Underworld 2. He was also a designer for\nSystem Shock.source\n\nAs for his creative endeavors, he has been super busy. He wrote a superhero\nnovel titled Soon I will be Invincible, and is following it up with a sequel\ntitled Fight Me on May 23rd, 2024. His other works include Crooked which looks\nlike a lovecraftian horror book with Richard Nixon as the bad guy, and You: A\nNovel. You: A Novel seems to be a comedy sci-fi book about gaming, but the\ndescription doesn\u2019t really tell me much about what the book is actually about.\n\nOverall, it looks like Austin has been getting busy with his novels. The book\nabout Richard Nixon sounds interesting, so I might pick that one up at some\npoint.\n\n## level designers\n\n### Harvey Smith\n\nHarvey Smith was the lead designer of Deus Ex, and has since worked with\nRicardo Bare on games such as Weird West, Redfall, and Prey. He has a personal\nsite but the last article he posted was in 2016. He did release a book titled\nBig Jack is Dead which is a book about a programmer with abusive parents. The\nconcept sounds interesting and I may one day give it a shot. I had to go to\nhis Twitter to find out anything about this book, which is surprising. I would\nthink he would post about it on his blog as well.\n\nStill, it looks like a good drama. I like that it takes place in Texas, and I\nam always down to read a story about programmers, even if it is fictional.\n\n### Marshall Andrews\n\nMarshall worked on a few games since Deus Ex, but has mostly stayed to himself\nfrom the looks of it. According to Mobygames he worked as a playtester for\nSystem Shock: Enhanced Edition, which is a version of System Shock with\nquality of life improvements.\n\n### Ricardo Bare\n\nThis guy is very active in the game design world. He worked on Redfall(along\nwith Robin and Harvey) and also was a designer for the game Prey.\n\nInterstingly, he has produced two novels. Jack of Hearts, and Fool of Fate. He\nalso wrote several short stories such as Worship Hymn, \u201cThe Rat Burner\u201d and\n\u201cOf Salmon\u2019s Tails and Green-Eyed Girls.\u201d The former two were both released in\nmagazines and I do not know of any legal place to read them outside of those\nmagazines, but if they are any good let me know.\n\nYou can view his personal website here but it doesn\u2019t look like he keeps it\nupdated.\n\n### Monte Martinez\n\nHe worked on several games that Ricardo and Robin have worked on. Redfall,\nDishonored, etc. He doesn\u2019t have a personal site that I could find, nor could\nI find any personal projects that he has put out.\n\n### Steve Powers\n\nSame story. Worked in the same studios as Ricardo and Monte, so a lot of the\nsame credits. Redfall, Prey, etc. He had a website in 2004 that contained some\nartwork and a picture of what is presumably his kid, but not much else.\n\n## Musicians\n\n### Alexander Brandon\n\nThis man is a legend in the world of video game music. Not only did he make\nthe music for Deus Ex, but he did music for Unreal Tournament, Jazz\nJackrabbit, Wasteland 2, Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze, and much more.\nHe has a Bandcamp where he releases his personal music for sale.\nInterestingly, he remastered the Deus Ex soundtrack as its own album\nConspiravision alongside Michiel Van Den Bos. And I gotta say, it ROCKS. The\nfull thing is available on Spotify but I recommend buying the album proper, to\nsupport him and Michiel.\n\n### Michiel Van Den Bos\n\nMichiel only worked on the original Deus Ex game, but he is still working in\nthe game music industry. Alongside Alexander he did the music for Unreal and\nUnreal Tournament. The most recent game that he composed music for is Sonic\nDream Team, and Age of Wonders 4.\n\nHis Twitter lists a personal website(www.michielvandenbos.com/) but it returns\na 404. Using the wayback machine we can see what it looked like but it\nimmediately tries loading flash, and the latest post was in 2012 so there\nisn\u2019t much to look at.\n\n### Daniel Gardopee\n\nDaniel, alongside the previous two, worked on Unreal, Unreal Tournament, and\nDeus Ex. In the 24 years since Deus Ex, has mostly worked on the 2k sports\ngames as an audio engineer.\n\nHe did, however, work on three albums with Mr. Brandon. AtmosphereS: Cultures,\nAtmosphereS: Moods and AtmosphereS: Pulses. However, for the life of me I\ncannot find these albums. Based on the cover art they seem right up my alley!\nIf someone knows of a place I can purchase/listen to these albums, let me\nknow!\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThere are many more people that worked on this game, but I think I got all the\nhighlights. I cut out some \u201csections\u201d such as programmers and artists because\nthere just wasn\u2019t anything interesting to talk about for those people in those\nsections, but they were just as vital to the game turning out as revolutionary\nas it did.\n\nI was surprised to see how many people who worked at Ion Storm ended up\nworking for Arkane! I suppose it makes sense, as Arkane is mostly known for\nPrey and Dishonored which are spiritual successors to games like Thief and\nDeus Ex. It is a shame that their latest game, Redfall, turned out to be a\nreal stinker. However, considering their track record and how many people\nworked on amazing projects in the past, I hope that whatever they come out\nwith next will be amazing.\n\nAs for the others, a lot of people ended up writing their own books and\npursuing other creative personal projects. In the future, I want to purchase\nsome of these novels, pieces of software and music, and talk about them here.\nThats a little ways off, though.\n\nimage credits\n\n  1. https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/42/Dxcover.jpg\n\n  2.
