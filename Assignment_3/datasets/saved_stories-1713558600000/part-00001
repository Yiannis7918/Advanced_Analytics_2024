Netflix handily topped expectations for subscribers net adds,\ngaining 9.33 million in the period, to reach nearly 270 million globally. It\nalso beat Wall Street expectations on the top and bottom lines.\n\nDespite the Q1 earnings beat, Netflix shares dropped more than 4.5% in after-\nhours trading Thursday, possibly as investors reacted negatively to the news\nthat the streamer will stop reporting quarterly sub totals.\n\n## Related Stories\n\nVIP+\n\n### \u2018Civil War\u2019 Record Opening Leaves A24 With More to Prove\n\n### Emmys: Updated Predictions in 31 Categories Including Guest Acting,\nDocumentaries and Variety Specials\n\nIn its Q1 letter to shareholders, Netflix said that engagement \u2014 time spent\nwith the service \u2014 is its \u201cbest proxy for customer satisfaction.\u201d As such, it\nwill no longer report quarterly membership numbers or average revenue per\nmember (which it dubs \u201cARM\u201d), as of Q1 2025. Netflix said it will announce\n\u201cmajor subscriber milestones as we cross them\u201d but will cease disclosing\nquarterly subscriber numbers.\n\n### Popular on Variety\n\n1/1 Skip Ad Continue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE\n\nNetflix continues to see solid subscriber gains in markets around the world;\nfor example, it netted 2.53 million new customers in the U.S. and Canada in\nQ1. But eventually those sub numbers will start to plateau, and the company\nwants to reorient investors toward time-spent-viewing metrics where it has\nmore potential upside in the years ahead.\n\nCo-CEO Greg Peters said on the earnings call that Netflix\u2019s number of\nsubscribers has been a decreasingly relevant measure for the health of the\ncompany\u2019s business. He cited, as an example, Netflix\u2019s paid-sharing\ninitiative, which gives primary account holders the option to add an \u201cextra\nmember\u201d for an incremental monthly fee (and those \u201cextra members\u201d are not\ncounted as separate subscribers). Meanwhile, with Netflix\u2019s advertising plan,\nhigher engagement is tied to higher revenue per member, as opposed to the\nfixed per-sub revenue on the plans with no ads.\n\n\u201cAs we\u2019ve noted in previous letters, we\u2019re focused on revenue and operating\nmargin as our primary financial metrics \u2014 and engagement (i.e. time spent) as\nour best proxy for customer satisfaction. In our early days, when we had\nlittle revenue or profit, membership growth was a strong indicator of our\nfuture potential,\u201d Netflix said in the letter. \u201cBut now we\u2019re generating very\nsubstantial profit and free cash flow (FCF). We are also developing new\nrevenue streams like advertising and our extra member feature, so memberships\nare just one component of our growth.\u201d\n\nThe company continued, \u201cIn addition, as we\u2019ve evolved our pricing and plans\nfrom a single to multiple tiers with different price points depending on the\ncountry, each incremental paid membership has a very different business\nimpact. It\u2019s why we stopped providing quarterly paid membership guidance in\n2023 and, starting next year with our Q1\u201925 earnings, we will stop reporting\nquarterly membership numbers and ARM.\u201d\n\nAccording to Netflix, it will continue to provide a breakout of revenue by\nregion each quarter and the foreign-exchange impact \u201cto complement our\nfinancials.\u201d Going forward, the company will add guidance for annual revenue\nin addition to what it already provides: annual operating margin and free cash\nflow forecast and forecasts for quarterly revenue, operating income, net\nincome and earnings per share.\n\nLast December, the company released its first \u201cNetflix Engagement Report,\u201d\ninclusive of more than 18,000 titles and nearly 100 billion hours viewed\nbetween January-June 2023, representing 99% of all viewing during that period.\nIn the report, Netflix divulged streaming performance metrics for licensed\ncontent. It plans to release the data twice per year \u2014 mainly to highlight the\nmassive engagement across a wide range of content on its service.\n\n\u201cSuccess in streaming starts with engagement,\u201d Netflix said in the shareholder\nletter in discussing the decision to stop reporting subscriber numbers. \u201cWhen\npeople watch more, they stick around longer (retention), recommend Netflix\nmore often (acquisition) and place a higher value on our service. It\u2019s why\nwe\u2019ve been providing progressively more information on engagement, starting\nwith our Top 10 weekly and most popular lists and more recently our biannual\nreport into viewing on Netflix (which covers ~99% of all video watch time on\nour service). This is more information than any of our competitors provide,\nand we expect to provide even more over time.\u201d\n\nVIP+ Analysis: Netflix Paid-Sharing Win Masks Long-Term Hurdles\n\nComments\n\nWant to read more articles like this one?\n\nSubscribe Today\n\n## More From Variety\n\n### Emmys: Updated Predictions in 31 Categories Including Guest Acting,\nDocumentaries and Variety Specials\n\n### \u2018Civil War\u2019 Record Opening Leaves A24 With More to Prove\n\n### The Most-Anticipated Movies of 2024\n\n### Emmys: Drama Series \u2013 Amazon Prime Video Could Score Its First Double Noms\nWith \u2018Fallout\u2019 and \u2018Mr. and Mrs. Smith\u2019\n\n### Why Hollywood Shouldn\u2019t Risk Another Strike Amid Gen AI Rise\n\n### Taylor Swift Renews Her Vows With Heartbreak in Audacious, Transfixing\n\u2018Tortured Poets Department\u2019: Album Review\n\nLoading comments...\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nComments are moderated.
