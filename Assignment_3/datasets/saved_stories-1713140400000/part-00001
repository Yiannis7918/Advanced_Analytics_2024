He found that the wish list back then more or less included a\nsystem that could understand the interaction of living elements in an\necosystem, visualize and simulate it, then predict future conditions. While\nthis system still hasn\u2019t arrived, it has more than a passing resemblance to\nlandscape technologists\u2019 hopes for the convergence of AI and landscape\narchitecture today.\n\nAs such, Ackerman sees the quest to integrate AI into landscape architecture\nnot as a revolutionary break with the past, but as a long and frustrated\nwrestling match to corral two disparate subjects: computational design and\nliving, biotic matter (the key differentiator of landscape architecture from\nother design disciplines). Then and now, \u201cthe fundamental problem with\nmodeling and visualization when it comes to a landscape is that we\u2019re trying\nto turn [landscapes] into objects,\u201d he says, \u201cbut in reality, these are living\nsystems.\u201d\n\n> Is cheaper design, even if it\u2019s available to a wider audience, a good thing?\n\nEnvironmental scientists and ecologists have been using machine learning much\nlonger than landscape architects. But landscape designers can complement this\nwork by contributing AI visualization tools to illustrate projects for broad\npublic audiences and policy forms, says Phil Fernberg, director of digital\ninnovation at OJB. \u201cWe are expertise siloed,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to partner\nwith these folks and build something together that would have never otherwise\nbeen built.\u201d\n\nEnvironmental scientists and ecologists have been using machine learning much\nlonger than landscape architects.

Pictured: Midjourney renderings by\nJeff Cutler.\n\nAnd while AI might be able to understand the relationship between a\nphotovoltaic panel and a power grid, unpacking how a tree (responsible for\nshade, habitats, the nutrient cycle, phytoremediation, evapotranspiration, and\nmore) works within a landscape is beyond its grasp.\n\nAs one of the smallest, most misunderstood design professions, stuck in the\nmiddle of the Venn diagram between much larger and more visible fields,\nlandscape architecture is often isolated (or shielded) from disruptive\ntechnological change.\n\n\u201cUnlike other tools that are really complex to operate, like BIM software, AI\nis not hard for the layperson to operate,\u201d says landscape architecture\nprofessor Aidan Ackerman. \u201cThere is no skill development needed.\u201d Absent this\nbaseline layer of technical skill, and eventually the strata of skills above\nit, design could become a purely curatorial process, selecting options\npresented by AI, de-skilling the workforce. Pictured: Midjourney renderings by\nJeff Cutler.\n\nLandscape architects sit in the midst of ecology, gardening, architecture,\nbotany, planning, and environmental science. They\u2019re a woolly and\nheterogeneous bunch that might be hyper-focused on planting patterns in\nneighborhood parks, the biodiversity of thousands of acres, or the stormwater\ncapacity of concrete infrastructure. This diffusion makes them difficult for\nany single technological change to consume. As such, there have been very few\ndigital tools created specifically for landscape architects.\n\nInstead, landscape architects have been making their own tools and adapting\nexisting ones to their needs. Anya Domlesky is the director of research at SWA\nGroup and runs the XL Lab, where SWA landscape designer Shimin Cao and\nUniversity of Southern California lecturer Xun Liu trained algorithms on\nGoogle Street View images of Houston, so that it can analyze and score\nstreetscapes for walkability, bikeability, tree cover, greenscapes, and more.\nThe eventual goal is for AI to generate streetscape designs. With SWA\nassociate Liqiu Xu, XL Lab is also using ChatGPT to devise planting pairings,\ngenerate site analysis and precedent studies, and create profiles for\npotential visitors to a real park site. Jeff Cutler, founder of Vancouver\nlandscape architecture firm space2place design, has been using Autodesk Forma,\nwhich uses AI to define microclimates on project sites.\n\nGiven the complexity and dynamic nature of living matter, Zihao Zhang,\nlandscape architecture professor at City College of New York, advocates for\nusing AI to develop landscape design not as a discrete product but as a\nprocess, a \u201csubscription basis\u201d for \u201ccontinuous engagement with the land,\u201d he\nsays. He\u2019s interested in using AI to \u201cco-produce\u201d outcomes, he explains, and\nhe feels that handing agency over to AI will allow it to solve problems in\nways humans never considered. This is, of course, diametrically opposed to how\nAI is being applied in landscape architecture today. The adoption of image\ngeneration platforms like Midjourney and DALL-E threatens a \u201cproliferation of\nthe picturesque\u201d that reinforces a vision of landscape architecture as a\npredominantly aesthetic practice, Zhang says.\n\nBecause landscape architecture is a service industry subservient to market\nforces, equitable solutions that prize human well-being over labor and cost\nexpediency will have to come in the form of hard-fought regulatory controls.\nAs such, designers must assert the need to train algorithms on human values.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really up to us to say, \u2018What do you optimize when you train this\nmodel?\u2019\u201d says Zihao Zhang, landscape architecture professor. Pictured:\nMidjourney rendering by Jeff Cutler\n\nAnd while these meta-collage images, with their surreal technical facility and\nstilted recapitulation of popular culture, are nowhere close to explaining\nthemselves as something that could be built or installed, academics say we may\nbe only a few years from being able to plug in material, dimensional, and\nprogrammatic constraints in AI and get something back we can actually make.\nAny delay beyond that will be the likely incursion of landscape architecture\u2019s\nawkward marriage to digital tools. Likewise, what\u2019s keeping us from Design\nSkynet is similarly rooted in the biotic world. To create buildable plans, AI\nwill need plan and section drawings to train on, which, as often-proprietary\ninformation, exist in hard-copy paper plans, locked up in file cabinets.\nThey\u2019ll have to be hauled out, scanned, and uploaded. \u201cThat\u2019s not low-hanging\nfruit,\u201d says Domlesky.\n\nAs the director of digital innovation at OJB, Phil Fernberg is using whole-\nlanguage text models to develop planting plans, and using parametric design\nengines to organize them in space. From there, the goal is to connect this\ndesign to the material supply chain and vendors. When this process is applied\nto residential projects, Fernberg foresees a broad consumer push in what is\nalready the largest single segment of the landscape design industry. \u201cHow do\nwe connect a bunch of readily available data sets to advance design and help\nit reach more people than it ever could?\u201d he says. \u201cBecause there\u2019s way more\npeople that own homes and landscapes than there are landscape architects to\nhelp them, or that they can afford.\u201d\n\nAutomated landscape design sounds like an unimpeachable deal for small\nclients. For labor, there\u2019s the eternal question of who collects the surplus\nthat results from these new efficiencies. Is cheaper design, even if it\u2019s\navailable to a wider audience, a good thing?\n\nIan Tahmin created this rendering (using Midjourney. His prompt? \u201c/ imagine a\npost-industrial park designed for birds.\u201d\n\nNeil Leach created this rendering using Midjourney V5.2.\n\nProbably not, says Neil Leach, architecture professor at Florida International\nUniversity, who studies AI in design. \u201cThe main driver of change is going to\nbe economics. What\u2019s cheapest?\u201d he says. \u201cThe professions are going to be\neroded by these new technologies. Because it gets easier to do these things,\nthe temptation is to drop fees. It\u2019s going to reduce the amount of money\ncoming into the profession.\u201d\n\nAI could collapse the landscape architecture labor market, and its system of\noccupational licensure with it. Of course, Leach reminds us that AI is \u201ca\ntool. It has no agency. It\u2019s the unscrupulous employers who are looking to cut\ncosts.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe elephant in the room is that we live in a capitalist society,\u201d says\nZhang.\n\nThe best-case scenario for landscape architecture is that its idiosyncrasy and\nmaladjustment give it time to join and build coalitions that can force AI in\ndesign to respond to the needs of people, not markets. \u201cThe way we receive AI\nis not going to fit our profession in any way,\u201d says Ackerman. \u201cI think that\nmight be our advantage here.\u201d\n\nWould you like to comment on this article?
