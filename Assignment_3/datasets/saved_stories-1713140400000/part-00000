To evaluate the accuracy of the predictions, we take advantage\n> of the fact that the training data at the time of experiment stopped at\n> September 2021, and ask about events that happened in 2022 using ChatGPT-3.5\n> and ChatGPT-4. We employed two prompting strategies: direct prediction and\n> what we call future narratives which ask ChatGPT to tell fictional stories\n> set in the future with characters that share events that have happened to\n> them, but after ChatGPT's training data had been collected. Concentrating on\n> events in 2022, we prompted ChatGPT to engage in storytelling, particularly\n> within economic contexts. After analyzing 100 prompts, we discovered that\n> future narrative prompts significantly enhanced ChatGPT-4's forecasting\n> accuracy. This was especially evident in its predictions of major Academy\n> Award winners as well as economic trends, the latter inferred from scenarios\n> where the model impersonated public figures like the Federal Reserve Chair,\n> Jerome Powell. These findings indicate that narrative prompts leverage the\n> models' capacity for hallucinatory narrative construction, facilitating more\n> effective data synthesis and extrapolation than straightforward predictions.\n> Our research reveals new aspects of LLMs' predictive capabilities and\n> suggests potential future applications in analytical contexts.\n\nComments:| 61 pages, 26 figures  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| General Economics (econ.GN); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.07396 [econ.GN]  \n(or arXiv:2404.07396v1 [econ.GN] for this version)  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Scott Cunningham [view email] [v1] Thu, 11 Apr 2024 00:03:03 UTC (3,365\nKB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled ChatGPT Can Predict the Future when it Tells\nStories Set in the Future About the Past, by Van Pham and Scott Cunningham\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\necon.GN\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI econ q-fin q-fin.EC\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
