I made this controversial claim:\n\n> The sun in the Southern Hemisphere moves counterclockwise across the sky\n> over the course of the day, rather than clockwise. Instead of coming up on\n> the left and going down on the right, as it does in the Northern Hemisphere,\n> it comes up on the right and goes down on the left.\n\nMany people found this confusing and I'm not sure our minds met on this. I am\ngoing to try to explain and see if I can clear up the puzzles.(To prevent\nendless parenthetical \u201c(in the Northern Hemisphere)\u201d qualifications, the rest\nof this article will describe how things look where I live, in the northern\ntemperate zones. I understand that things will be reversed in the Southern\nHemisphere, and quite different near the equator and the poles.)\u201cWhich way are\nyou facing?\u201d was a frequent question. \u201cIf you're facing north, it comes up on\nthe right, not the left.\u201dHere's what I think the sky looks like most of the\nday on most of the days of the year:The sun is in the southern sky through the\nentire autumn, winter, and spring. In summer it is sometimes north of the\ncelestial equator, for up to a couple of hours after sunrise and before\nsunset, but it is still in the southern sky most of the time. If you are\nwatching the sun's path through the sky, you are looking south, not north,\nbecause if you are looking north you do not see the sun, it is behind you.Some\npeople even tried to argue that if you face north, the sun's path is a\ncounterclockwise circle, rather than a clockwise one. This is risible. Here's\nmy grandfather's old grandfather clock. Notice that the hands go\ncounterclockwise! You study the clock and disagree. They don't go\ncounterclockwise, you say, they go clockwise, just like on every other clock.\nAha, but no! If you were standing behind the clock, looking into it with the\nback door open, you would clearly see the hands go counterclockwise! Then you\nkick me in the shin, as I deserve.Yes, if you were to face away from the sun,\nits path could be said to be counterclockwise, if you could see it. But that\nis not how we describe things. If I say that a train passed left to right, you\nwould not normally expect me to add \u201cbut it would have been right to left, had\nI been facing the tracks\u201d.At least one person said they had imagined the sun\nrising directly ahead, then passing overhead, and going down in back. Okay,\nfair enough. You don't say that the train passed left to right if you were\nstanding on the tracks and it ran you down.Except that the sun does not pass\ndirectly overhead. It only does that in the tropics. If this person were\nreally facing the sun as it rose, and stayed facing that way, the sun would go\nup toward their right side. If it were a train, the train tracks would go in a\nbig curve around their right (south) side, from left to right:Mixed gauge\ntrack (950 and 1435mm) at Sassari station, Sardinia, 1996 by user Afterbrunel,\nCC BY-SA 3.0 DEED, via Wikimedia Commons.After the train passed, it would go\nback the other way, but they wouldn't be able see it, because it would be\nbehind them. If they turned around to watch it go, it would still go left to\nright:And if they were to turn to follow it over the course of the day, they\nwould be turning left to right the whole time, and the sun would be moving\nfrom left to right the whole time, going up on the left and coming down on the\nright, like the hands of a clock \u2014 \u201cclockwise\u201d, as it were.One correspondent\nsuggested that perhaps many people in technologically advanced countries are\nnot actually familiar with how the sun and moon move, and this was the cause\nof some of the confusion. Perhaps so, it's certainly tempting to dismiss my\ncritics as not knowing how the sun behaves. The other possibility is that I am\nutterly confused. I took Observational Astronomy in college twice, and failed\nboth times.Anyway, I will maybe admit that \u201cleft to right\u201d was unclear. But I\nwill not recant my claim that the sun moves clockwise. E pur si muove in senso\norario.\n\n### Sundials\n\nHere I was just dead wrong. I said:\n\n> In the Northern Hemisphere, the shadow of a sundial proceeds clockwise, from\n> left to right.\n\nAbsolutely not, none of this is correct. First, \u201cleft to right\u201d. Here's a\ndiagram of a typical sundial:It has a sticky-up thing called a \u2018gnomon\u2019 that\ncasts a shadow across the numbers, and the shadow moves from left to right\nover the course of the day. But obviously the sundial will work just as well\nif you walk around and look at it from the other side:It still goes clockwise,\nbut now clockwise is right to left instead of left to right.It's hard to read\nbecause the numerals are upside down? Fine, whatever:Here, unlike with the\nsun, \u201cgo around to the other side\u201d is perfectly reasonable.Talking with Joe\nArdent, I realized that not even \u201cclockwise\u201d is required for sundials. Imagine\nthe south-facing wall of a building, with the gnomon sticking out of it\nperpendicular. When the sun passes overhead, the gnomon will cast a shadow\ndownwards on the wall, and the downward-pointing shadow will move from left to\nright \u2014 counterclockwise \u2014 as the sun makes its way from east to west. It's\nnot even far-fetched. Indeed, a search for \u201cvertical sundials\u201d produced\nnumerous examples:Sundial on the Moot Hall by David Dixon, CC BY 2.0\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0, via Wikimedia Commons and\nGeograph.\n\n### Winter weather on July 4\n\nFinally, it was reported that there were complaints on Hacker News that\nAustralians do not celebrate July 4th. Ridiculous! All patriotic Americans\ncelebrate July 4th.[Other articles in category /geo] permanent link\n\n", "frontpage": false}
