He\nwas the leader of the free-trade movement in France from its inception in 1840\nuntil his untimely death in 1850. The first 45 years of his life were spent in\npreparation for five tremendously productive years writing in favor of\nfreedom. Bastiat was the founder of the weekly newspaper, Le Libre \u00c9change, a\ncontributor to numerous periodicals, and the author of sundry pamphlets and\nspeeches dealing with the pressing issues of his day. Most of his writing was\ndone in the years directly before and after the Revolution of 1848\u2014a time when\nFrance was rapidly embracing socialism. As a deputy in the Legislative\nAssembly, Bastiat fought valiantly for the private property order, but\nunfortunately the majority of his colleagues chose to ignore him. Frederic\nBastiat remains one of the great champions of freedom whose writings retain\ntheir relevance as we continue to confront the old adversary.\n\n1.\n\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat: Ideas and Influence (Foundation for Economic Education,\n1963).\n\n2.\n\nAll translations in this Introduction are from the original French. Thus, my\nselection of words will doubtless differ somewhat from those chosen by the\ntranslator of the text. That, of course, is of no consequence.\n\nNotes to \u201cTo the Youth of France\u201d\n\n3.\n\n[\u201cI, too, am a painter,\u201d supposedly the young Correggio\u2019s words when he first\nsaw Raphael\u2019s painting of Saint Cecilia.\u2014Translator.]\n\n4.\n\n[As the ensuing pages of this book make clear, Bastiat uses the words\n\u201cpolitical economy\u201d and the \u201ceconomists\u201d to designate in a general way the\n\u201cclassical\u201d school of economists to which he himself gave allegiance. These\ninclude the eighteenth-century \u201cphysiocrats\u201d: Quesnay ( Tableau \u00e8conomique,\n1759), Mercier de la Rivi\u00e8re, Dupont de Nemours, Le Tr\u00f4sne, Mirabeau,\nCondorcet, and Turgot; the \u201cEnglish School\u201d: Adam Smith, Malthus, John Stuart\nMill, Senior, Scrope, and Ricardo; and his own French contemporaries: Jean-\nBaptiste Say, Pellegrino Rossi, Garnier, and others less well known who held\nsimilar views on wealth and free exchange. See also Bastiat\u2019s comments in\nchapter 9.\u2014Translator.]\n\n5.\n\n[Thomas Robert Malthus (1766-1834), English economist. Cf. chapter 16 for\nBastiat\u2019s discussion of his Essay on the Principle of Population.\u2014Translator.]\n\n6.\n\n[David Ricardo (1772-1823), English economist of the classical\nschool.\u2014Translator.]\n\n7.\n\n[Alexis Charles Henri Cl\u00e9rel de Tocqueville (1805-1859), statesman and author\nof numerous significant books.\u2014Translator.]\n\n8.\n\n[\u201cSocialists,\u201d \u201cegalitarians,\u201d \u201ccommunists\u201d: In France, before the time of\nKarl Marx, of course, these terms were used, as Bastiat uses them, to refer\ngenerally to those political theorists advocating collectivism primarily as a\nmeans to advance equality. Before and during the Revolution they included\nMorelly ( Code de la nature, 1755); Mably ( Doutes.... sur l\u2019ordre naturel et\nessentiel des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s politiques, 1768); Babeuf, founder of the society of\n\u201cthe Equals\u201d (executed in 1797), and his later followers: Philippe Buonarroti,\nArmand Barb\u00e8s, Martin Bernard, and Louis Auguste Blanqui. Bastiat also\nincludes as sharers of these ideas his contemporary \u201cplanners of artificial\nsocial orders\u201d: Fourier, Louis Blanc, Consid\u00e9rant, Cabet, Owen, and Saint-\nSimon. (Cf. notes on Fourier, Louis Blanc, Owen, and Cabet, chapter 1, p. 11;\non Proudhon, chapter 5, p. 128; on Consid\u00e9rant, p. 550.)\u2014Translator.]\n\n9.\n\nSee preceding footnote.\n\n10.\n\nSee footnote supra on \u201csocialists.\u201d\n\nChapter 1\n\n1.\n\nI can illustrate this law more clearly by figures. Let us take three periods\nduring which capital increases while labor remains constant, and let us\nrepresent total production in each of the three periods as: 80-100-120. The\ndistribution will be as follows:\n\nCapital\u2019s Share| Labor\u2019s Share| Total  \n---|---|---  \nFirst period| 45| 35| 80  \nSecond period| 50| 50| 100  \nThird period| 55| 65| 120  \n  \nOf course, these ratios are intended to serve only as an illustration.\n\nNOTES TO CHAPTER 1\n\nCategories: Frederic Bastiat\n\nSHARE POST:\n\n###### RELATED CONTENT By Bryan Caplan\n\n##### Mises and Bastiat on How Democracy Goes Wrong, Part I\n\n\"It is only to be expected that the general public prefers to blame political\ninsiders\u2014rather than itself\u2014for bad policies. But economists also... rarely\nput the man in the street on their list of suspects.\" Economists are\nhabitually disappointed by what governments do. Dictatorships are the worst\noffenders, featuring a rogue's gallery of impoverishing policies from farm\ncollectivization to backyard steel mills to expulsions of minority merchant\nclasses.
