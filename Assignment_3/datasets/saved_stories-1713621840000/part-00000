Each page is assigned a three\ndigit number - you'll see navigation lines that give a page description\nfollowed by a number (e.g. \"Sport Headlines 302\") Use the number keys on the\non-screen remote (or your keyboard if you're on a PC) to enter a number. The\ntop row turns green as we wait for the page to load. You can also use the\n\"channel up/down\" buttons to move up or down one page at a time.\n\n  * ## Pages From Ceefax\n\nView live Pages from Ceefax as shown on BBC2 overnight\n\n  * ## In The News\n\nNews stories featuring Ceefax\n\n  * ## History\n\nHow this re-creation came to exist\n\n# More from NMS\n\n  * ## Stuff I Made\n\nElectronic devices I've created\n\n  * ## Projects\n\nProjects I've undertaken\n\n  * ## Contact\n\nHow to get in touch and other account information\n\nko-fi.com/avrovulcanxh607\n\nko-fi.com/avrovulcanxh607\n\n", "frontpage": true}
