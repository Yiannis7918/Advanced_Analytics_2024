It can also recognize sounds of coughing or\nbreathing difficulties, or unusual noises, such as glass breaking.\n\nMost intriguing, it can recognize and monitor environmental sounds, and they\ncan be further processed to let users know if a natural disaster is about to\nhappen.\n\nThe system takes a sound signal and breaks it into smaller parts, or segments.\nEach segment is processed to create a normalized representation of the sound\nin the time domain. This is like a map of the sound over time.\n\nThis map is then fed into a trained neural network, which is a type of\nartificial intelligence. The neural network generates scores and probabilities\nfor each type of sound event in each segment. This is like guessing what type\nof sound each segment is and how sure it is about the guess.\n\nAfter that, the system does some post-processing to smooth out the scores and\nprobabilities and generate confidence values for each type of sound for\ndifferent window sizes.\n\nUltimately, this technology can be used in various applications. In a smart\nhome device, it can detect when someone breaks into the house, by recognizing\nthe sound of glass shattering, or if a newborn is hungry, or distressed, by\nrecognizing the sounds of baby crying.\n\nIt can also be used in healthcare, to accurately detect lung or heart\ndiseases, by recognizing heartbeat sounds, coughing, or breathing\ndifficulties.\n\nBut one of its most important applications would be to prevent casual users of\nupcoming natural disasters by recognizing and detecting sounds associated with\nthem.\n\n> The raw audio signal may contain environmental or day-to-day sounds that\n> form audio events to be detected by the computer system, such as a siren,\n> alarm, dorg barking, baby crying, gunshots, explosions, applause, and/or\n> laughter, etc.\n\nSince the technology uses neural networks, it can be easily integrated into AI\nmodels, such as Copilot on Windows, ChatGPT, or any other models on the\nmarket.\n\nOn Windows, however, it would be most useful, as casual users could Copilot\nbeing able to detect natural disasters and warn them when they\u2019re in danger.\nIt could also act as a security system, alerting users when someone breaks\ninto their house.\n\nYou can read the full paper here.\n\nMore about the topics: AI, microsoft\n\nFlavius Floare\n\nTech Journalist\n\nFlavius is a writer and a media content producer with a particular interest in\ntechnology, gaming, media, film and storytelling.
