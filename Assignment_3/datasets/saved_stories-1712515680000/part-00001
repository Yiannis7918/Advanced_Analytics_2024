XigmaNAS is the simplest and fastest way to create\na centralized and easily-accessible server for all kinds of data easily\naccessed with all kinds of network protocols and from any network.\n\nXigmaNAS supports sharing across Windows, Apple, and UNIX-like systems. It\nincludes ZFS v5000 , Software RAID (0,1,5), disk encryption, S.M.A.R.T / email\nreports etc. with the following protocols: CIFS/SMB (Samba), Active Directory\nDomain Controller (Samba), FTP, NFS, TFTP, AFP, RSYNC, Unison, iSCSI\n(initiator and target), HAST, CARP, Bridge, UPnP, and Bittorent which is all\nhighly configurable by its WEB interface. XigmaNAS can be installed on Compact\nFlash/USB-key/SSD Drive, Hard disk or booted from a LiveCD/LiveUSB with a\nsmall usb-key/floppy drive for it\u2019s configuration storage.\n\n### Why XigmaNAS?\n\nIt\u2019s nice to have an expensive off-the-shelf NAS box, but how can you be sure\nyou bought a great solution or just a shiny box? It probably has a slick\ninterface but underneath it isn\u2019t really what you were looking for. Over the\nyears with competition we see underpowered NAS devices that are modified with\nhardware/software locks and software updates ends within 2-3 years. And with\nmany other things, once you\u2019ve bought it, good luck getting upgrades.\n\nXigmaNAS keeps going where many commercial box solutions stop. Your customized\nXigmaNAS solution will likely be cheaper, more powerful, and more custom fit\nto your needs than many commercial NAS boxes. The XigmaNAS project also sees\nregular development, always with the focus on stability and simplicity. This\nmeans XigmaNAS receives regular updates, some of which include new features,\nbug fixes, and version upgrades of included components. These updates help\nkeeping your NAS up-to-date with the latest standards and the best working\nversions for many, many years.\n\nTry XigmaNAS,\n\nWe think you\u2019ll like it.\n\n### Partners & Sponsors\n\n### XigmaNAS Links\n\n  * XigmaNAS Documentation\n  * XigmaNAS User Forums\n  * XigmaNAS IRC Network\n  * XigmaNAS Sourceforge\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2012 - 2024 XigmaNAS\u00ae, All Rights Reserved.
