They changed\napplicants\u2019 names to suggest that they were white or Black, and male or female\n\u2014 Latisha or Amy, Lamar or Adam.\n\nOn Monday, they released the names of the companies. On average, they found,\nemployers contacted the presumed white applicants 9.5 percent more often than\nthe presumed Black applicants.\n\nYet this practice varied significantly by firm and industry. One-fifth of the\ncompanies \u2014 many of them retailers or car dealers \u2014 were responsible for\nnearly half of the gap in callbacks to white and Black applicants.\n\nTwo companies favored white applicants over Black applicants significantly\nmore than others.

Walters\n\nWhat Researchers Discovered When They Sent 80,000 Fake R\u00e9sum\u00e9s to U.S. Jobs -\nThe New York Times\n\nKnown as an audit study, the experiment was the largest of its kind in the\nUnited States: The researchers sent 80,000 r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to 10,000 jobs from 2019 to\n2021. The results demonstrate how entrenched employment discrimination is in\nparts of the U.S. labor market \u2014 and the extent to which Black workers start\nbehind in certain industries.\n\n\u201cI am not in the least bit surprised,\u201d said Daiquiri Steele, an assistant\nprofessor at the University of Alabama School of Law who previously worked for\nthe Department of Labor on employment discrimination. \u201cIf you\u2019re having\ntrouble breaking in, the biggest issue is the ripple effect it has. It affects\nyour wages and the economy of your community going forward.\u201d\n\nSome companies showed no difference in how they treated applications from\npeople assumed to be white or Black. Their human resources practices \u2014 and one\npolicy in particular (more on that later) \u2014 offer guidance for how companies\ncan avoid biased decisions in the hiring process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nA lack of racial bias was more common in certain industries: food stores,\nincluding Kroger; food products, including Mondelez; freight and transport,\nincluding FedEx and Ryder; and wholesale, including Sysco and McLane Company.\n\n\u201cWe want to bring people\u2019s attention not only to the fact that racism is real,\nsexism is real, some are discriminating, but also that it\u2019s possible to do\nbetter, and there\u2019s something to be learned from those that have been doing a\ngood job,\u201d said Patrick Kline, an economist at the University of California,\nBerkeley, who conducted the study with Evan K. Rose at the University of\nChicago and Christopher R. Walters at Berkeley.\n\nThe researchers first published details of their experiment in 2021, but\nwithout naming the companies. The new paper, which is set to run in the\nAmerican Economic Review, names the companies and explains the methodology\ndeveloped to group them by their performance, while accounting for statistical\nnoise.\n\n### Sample R\u00e9sum\u00e9s From the Experiment\n\nFictitious r\u00e9sum\u00e9s sent to large U.S. companies revealed a preference, on\naverage, for candidates whose names suggested that they were white.\n\nR\u00e9sum\u00e9s with distinctively white names\n\n\u201cTodd\u201d\n\n\u201cAllison\u201d\n\nR\u00e9sum\u00e9s with distinctively Black names\n\n\u201cLakisha\u201d\n\n\u201cLeroy\u201d\n\nTo assign names, the researchers started with a prior list that had been\nassembled using Massachusetts birth certificates from 1974 to 1979. They then\nsupplemented this list with names found in a database of speeding tickets\nissued in North Carolina between 2006 and 2018, classifying a name as\n\u201cdistinctive\u201d if more than 90 percent of people with that name were of a\nparticular race.\n\nSource: Patrick Kline, Evan K. Rose and Christopher R. Walters\n\nThe study includes 97 firms. The jobs the researchers applied to were entry\nlevel, not requiring a college degree or substantial work experience. In\naddition to race and gender, the researchers tested other characteristics\nprotected by law, like age and sexual orientation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThey sent up to 1,000 applications to each company, applying for as many as\n125 jobs per company in locations nationwide, to try to uncover patterns in\ncompanies\u2019 operations versus isolated instances. Then they tracked whether the\nemployer contacted the applicant within 30 days.\n\n## A bias against Black names\n\nCompanies requiring lots of interaction with customers, like sales and retail,\nparticularly in the auto sector, were most likely to show a preference for\napplicants presumed to be white. This was true even when applying for\npositions at those firms that didn\u2019t involve customer interaction, suggesting\nthat discriminatory practices were baked in to corporate culture or H.R.\npractices, the researchers said.\n\nStill, there were exceptions \u2014 some of the companies exhibiting the least bias\nwere retailers, like Lowe\u2019s and Target.\n\nThe study may underestimate the rate of discrimination against Black\napplicants in the labor market as a whole because it tested large companies,\nwhich tend to discriminate less, said Lincoln Quillian, a sociologist at\nNorthwestern who analyzes audit studies. It did not include names intended to\nrepresent Latino or Asian American applicants, but other research suggests\nthat they are also contacted less than white applicants, though they face less\ndiscrimination than Black applicants.\n\nThe experiment ended in 2021, and some of the companies involved might have\nchanged their practices since. Still, a review of all available audit studies\nfound that discrimination against Black applicants had not changed in three\ndecades. After the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, such discrimination\nwas found to have disappeared among certain employers, but the researchers\nbehind that study said the effect was most likely short-lived.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\n## Gender, age and L.G.B.T.Q. status\n\nOn average, companies did not treat male and female applicants differently.\nThis aligns with other research showing that gender discrimination against\nwomen is rare in entry-level jobs, and starts later in careers.\n\nHowever, when companies did favor men (especially in manufacturing) or women\n(mostly at apparel stores), the biases were much larger than for race.\nBuilders FirstSource contacted presumed male applicants more than twice as\noften as female ones. Ascena, which owns brands like Ann Taylor, contacted\nwomen 66 percent more than men.\n\nNeither company responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe consequences of being female differed by race. The differences were small,\nbut being female was a slight benefit for white applicants, and a slight\npenalty for Black applicants.\n\nThe researchers also tested several other characteristics protected by law,\nwith a smaller number of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. They found there was a small penalty for\nbeing over 40.\n\nOverall, they found no penalty for using nonbinary pronouns. Being gay, as\nindicated by including membership in an L.G.B.T.Q. club on the r\u00e9sum\u00e9,\nresulted in a slight penalty for white applicants, but benefited Black\napplicants \u2014 although the effect was small, when this was on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s,\nthe racial penalty disappeared.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nUnder the Civil Rights Act of 1964, discrimination is illegal even if it\u2019s\nunintentional. Yet in the real world, it is difficult for job applicants to\nknow why they did not hear back from a company.\n\n\u201cThese practices are particularly challenging to address because applicants\noften do not know whether they are being discriminated against in the hiring\nprocess,\u201d Brandalyn Bickner, a spokeswoman for the Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission, said in a statement. (It has seen the data and spoken\nwith the researchers, though it could not use an academic study as the basis\nfor an investigation, she said.)\n\n## What companies can do to reduce discrimination\n\nSeveral common measures \u2014 like employing a chief diversity officer, offering\ndiversity training or having a diverse board \u2014 were not correlated with\ndecreased discrimination in entry-level hiring, the researchers found.\n\nBut one thing strongly predicted less discrimination: a centralized H.R.\noperation.\n\nThe researchers recorded the voice mail messages that the fake applicants\nreceived. When a company\u2019s calls came from fewer individual phone numbers,\nsuggesting that they were originating from a central office, there tended to\nbe less bias. When they came from individual hiring managers at local stores\nor warehouses, there was more. These messages often sounded frantic and\ninformal, asking if an applicant could start the next day, for example.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when implicit biases kick in,\u201d Professor Kline said. A more formalized\nhiring process helps overcome this, he said: \u201cJust thinking about things,\nwhich steps to take, having to run something by someone for approval, can be\nquite important in mitigating bias.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nAt Sysco, a wholesale restaurant food distributor, which showed no racial bias\nin the study, a centralized recruitment team reviews r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and decides whom\nto call. \u201cConsistency in how we review candidates, with a focus on the\nrequirements of the position, is key,\u201d said Ron Phillips, Sysco\u2019s chief human\nresources officer. \u201cIt lessens the opportunity for personal viewpoints to rise\nin the process.\u201d\n\nAnother important factor is diversity among the people hiring, said Paula\nHubbard, the chief human resources officer at McLane Company. It procures,\nstores and delivers products for large chains like Walmart, and showed no\nracial bias in the study. Around 40 percent of the company\u2019s recruiters are\npeople of color, and 60 percent are women.\n\nDiversifying the pool of people who apply also helps, H.R. officials said.\nMcLane goes to events for women in trucking and puts up billboards in Spanish.\n\nSo does hiring based on skills, versus degrees. While McLane used to require a\ncollege degree for many roles, it changed that practice after determining that\nspecific skills mattered more for warehousing or driving jobs. \u201cWe now do that\nfor all our jobs: Is there truly a degree required?\u201d Ms. Hubbard said. \u201cWhy?\nDoes it make sense? Is experience enough?\u201d\n\nHilton, another company that showed no racial bias in the study, also stopped\nrequiring degrees for many jobs, in 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnother factor associated with less bias in hiring, the new study found, was\nmore regulatory scrutiny \u2014 like at federal contractors, or companies with more\nLabor Department citations.\n\nFinally, more profitable companies were less biased, in line with a long-held\neconomics theory by the Nobel Prize winner Gary Becker that discrimination is\nbad for business. Economists said that could be because the more profitable\ncompanies benefit from a more diverse set of employees. Or it could be an\nindication that they had more efficient business processes, in H.R. and\nelsewhere.\n\nClaire Cain Miller writes about gender, families and the future of work for\nThe Upshot.
