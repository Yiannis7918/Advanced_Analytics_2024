It adapts to your needs, growing with you and\nyour site.\n\nHere are ways Statamic can adapt. We call them \"Statamadaptations\".\n\nThere\u2019s no database until you need one.\n\nIt\u2019s a front-to-back CMS until you need to go headless.\n\nIt\u2019s dynamically powered by PHP & Laravel until you need to go static.\n\nIt\u2019s full-stack until you go JAMstack.\n\nHost it on any modern PHP server until you want to go serverless.\n\nUse the control panel unless you don\u2019t feel like it. Code editors are great\ntoo.\n\nYou can version control everything unless you don\u2019t want to.\n\n## We\u2019re obsessed with developer experience and efficiency.\n\nFrom clear documentation, error messages, & code comments to workflows & tools\ndesigned for rapid development, you'll find we obsess over details.\n\nCommand line tools to save you time & avoid clicking around the Control Panel.\nUnless you want to, of course.\n\nInstall & update Statamic, third-party addons, Laravel packages, and all other\ndependencies with Composer the way the good lord intended. You can even do it\nfrom inside the Control Panel.\n\nSpeed up your workflow by scaffolding out views & blueprints after creating\nnew collections and taxonomies.\n\nCommand line tools to save you time & avoid clicking around the Control Panel.\nUnless you want to, of course.\n\nInstall & update Statamic, third-party addons, Laravel packages, and all other\ndependencies with Composer the way the good lord intended.

For all\nother times, take advantage of 40+ different fieldtypes available and craft\nthe perfect authoring experience to support your bespoke design.\n\n## Extend Statamic with Laravel. Enhance Laravel with Statamic. Maybe do both.\n\nStatamic is built as a highly extendable, standalone capable, Laravel CMS\npackage. If you\u2019re already a Laravel developer, you\u2019ll feel right at home\nextending core features with Models, Service Providers, and Middleware. You\ncan even drop it into existing Laravel applications to add a full CMS in\nseconds. But you do not need to know Laravel or PHP to use Statamic.\n\nThe control panel is built with Vue.js and can be customized with your own\nJavaScript or third-party addons. Fieldtypes and filters have access to data\nthrough Vuex. Build Widgets to power any dashboard you can imagine. Or just\nlet it do its thing because it's already pretty great.\n\n## We're extremely proud and protective of our active & thriving community.\n\nYou can probably connect with them wherever you enjoy most.\n\nTalk with Statamic developers in our live Discord chat.\n\n#statamic\n\nGet twitterpated & connect with Statamic folks on social media.\n\nDiscussions\n\nAsk questions, show code, and share knowledge.\n\nLet's just get right to the heart of why you're here.\n\n## You're probably comparing Statamic to WordPress, right?\n\n## When it seems like everyone else is using WordPress, why use anything else?\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to just plop a generic theme on the internet and replace\nplaceholder text with your company name and phone number, then maybe you\nshould just use WordPress.\n\nBut if you're looking to build and maintain a website that can adapt the way\nyour business adapts, keep reading. We'll explain how Statamic saves you\nmoney, keeps you safer, and makes changes faster than any other CMS.\n\n## Let's talk about money first.\n\nWordPress is free. Statamic isn't.\n\nWordPress has hidden costs. Statamic doesn't.\n\nWith WordPress you'll probably need to buy a premium theme and hire a\ndeveloper to customize it, who might tell you last minute that what you're\ntrying to do isn't possible with the \"page builder\" you're using and you'll\nneed to switch to another theme and start over.\n\nYou'll need to buy Jetpack for $99/year because after all, it's \"essential\".\nAdd Advanced Custom Fields for $49/year, a backup solution for $200/year, a\nforms module for $349/year, a search plugin for $149/yr, and premium \"managed\"\nWordPress hosting, and before you know it you've committed to over $1,000/year\njust to keep the site online.\n\nNot to mention having to keep track of updates, billing, and customer support\nwith a half dozen (or more) different companies.\n\n### Statamic costs $275, one time.\n\nAfter that it's just an optional $65/year whenever you want updates and access\nto direct support from the team who built it. In most cases you can run\nStatamic on a $5/mo Digital Ocean server, or deploy a static site to Vercel or\nNetlify for free.\n\nBy paying for software, your money goes directly towards supporting and\nimproving it. When software is free, you are the product. We're not in the\ndata business, and we keep as little of it as we can.\n\nOh, and all those features that don't come with WordPress? They're all\nincluded in Statamic core.\n\n## And then there's security.\n\n96% of the websites hacked are running WordPress (source). It is the most\ntargeted and vulnerable CMS on the market.\n\nIf you don't have a developer dedicated to keeping your site up to date, you\nare vulnerable. Emergency developer support to recover or restore your site\ncan be expensive, on top of lost business from an exploited site or data leak.\n\n### 3 reasons Statamic is more secure than WordPress\n\n  1. Most website hacks are done through SQL Injection. Out of the box Statamic doesn't use a database, thus eliminating most forms of automated attack.\n  2. Statamic's developer team maintains all of the fundamental features most websites need. You will not need 50 plugins by 50 authors of questionable quality to build your site. This is why WordPress is so vulnerable.\n  3. Statamic is built on Laravel, widely regarded as the most secure and well-maintained PHP framework today. WordPress is new wine in an old wineskin (a legacy codebase from 2005).\n\n## Statamic's features are aligned to your business needs.\n\n### The Flat File Approach\n\nStatamic stores all of your content, templates, assets, and settings in files\ninstead of a database. You can see them, touch them, edit them in any editor\nof your choosing, and even email them to a colleague.\n\nThis allows us to version control your entire website. You can roll the site\nback to any point in time, work on alternate \"branches\" without affecting the\nsite and merge changes back when they're ready.\n\nYour site is always \"backed up\" and every change can be audited. Anything can\nbe copy & pasted or shared between multiple sites. Developers are more\nproductive when working with version controlled code, and their changes can be\ndeployed to your live site instantly without taking it offline.\n\n### The Content Editing Experience\n\nTime and time again we receive emails from customers, agencies, and developers\nalike sharing quotes from their clients. The common sentiment is they are\noverwhelmingly impressed with how easy and intuitive the content editing\nexperience is.\n\nEach Statamic site is fine-tuned and configured for the sites actual content.\nYou are not stuck with one giant \"What You See Is What You Get\" field, nor are\nyou decieved by the over-promises of \"page builders\".\n\nStatamic is trusted by world-class newsrooms like Der Spiegel, international\ntech companies like OpenTable, and thousands of small businesses. You can\nexplore a curated list of them, if you're interested.\n\n### Simplicity First, Complexity Later\n\nWe find it\u2019s much more efficient to turn on the things you need, enable\nfeatures you plan to use, and name things the way you want, than spend\nprecious time clicking about the control panel disabling everything you may\nnever end up needing. This allows developers to jump into new projects faster\nthan ever.\n\nWhen the need for complexity arrives \u2014 whether driven by traffic or business\nneeds \u2014 Statamic will scale with you. Swap the flat file approach for a\ndatabase, or cloud data provider, switch into Headless CMS mode and use\nReact/Gatsby, JAMStack, power mobile applications, or any number of other tech\napproaches.\n\nAnd if you need to build a full-scale custom application, Laravel is under the\nhood, ready and waiting.\n\n## Here are some more important facts and details.\n\nStatamic is mature and stable. We've been here since 2012.\n\nThe Statamic developer community is strong. We have more than 25k customers\nand nearly 2,500 of them are chatting right now in our live Discord chat.\n\nThe Statamic Ecosystem contains hundreds of addons, from e-commerce and SEO to\nsocial media tools. For when you need them.\n\nOur core team handles direct support for developers. We also offer SLA support\nfor teams that need lightning fast answers to just about anything.\n\nStatamic is a part of the greater Laravel Ecosystem, one of the largest and\nmost inclusive tech communities, not to mention the most popular Open Source\nPHP framework today.\n\nThere's so much to learn, but if you decide to not take a journey...\n\nAnd we're just scratching the surface. But before we go any deeper...\n\n## There's one thing you need to know.\n\nStatamic isn\u2019t a one-click, generic website cloning facility. We operate in\nthe vivid & bespoke web full of original, radical thinkers, powering fresh &\nquickly adapting sites that pave the way into the unknown.\n\n## Our customers have a lot to say about their switch to Statamic.\n\n\u201c\n\nSpent some time with Statamic 3 today. It\u2019s. The. Business. After 20 years of\nworking with content management systems (yep: old), its very rare to see\nsomething out of the box that works so well. Brilliant. From the UX, to the\ninterface, to the developer experience.\n\nMark Boulton Design Director\n\n\u201d\n\n\u201c\n\nI\u2019m a huge fan of Statamic.\n\nAndy Clarke Head of Creative, Stuff and Nonsense\n\n\u201d\n\n\u201c\n\nStatamic is some of the best software I've used (and I use it every day).
