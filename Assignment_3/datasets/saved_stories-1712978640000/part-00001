It's\n'a weapon of war'\n\nPublished Thu, Apr 11 202412:12 PM EDTUpdated Thu, Apr 11 20241:16 PM EDT\n\nRohan Goswami@in/rohangoswamicnbc/@rogoswami\n\nWATCH LIVE\n\nKey Points\n\n  * Top venture capitalist Vinod Khosla and Palantir advisor Jacob Helberg penned an open letter to the U.S. Senate calling on it to pass the so-called TikTok ban bill.\n  * Helberg and Khosla have regularly voiced their views on the dangers TikTok poses to the U.S., describing it as a \"weapon of war.\"\n  * In an interview with CNBC, Helberg said the U.S. has a \"long tradition\" of moving against individual companies \"when national security is at stake.\"\n\nIn this article\n\n  * PLTR\n\nVinod Khosla and Jacob Helberg.\n\nPatrick T. Fallon | AFP | Picture Alliance | Getty Images\n\nInvestor Vinod Khosla and Palantir advisor Jacob Helberg penned an open letter\nThursday calling on senators to pass a bill that would force the divestiture\nof Bytedance-owned TikTok in the U.S.\n\nDescribing the social media platform as \"a weapon of war,\" Helberg and Khosla\ncompared the bill with decades-old restrictions on foreign ownership of U.S.\nmedia outlets.\n\n\"Would you let North Korea or Iran own a broadcast channel that 67% of teens\nspend almost two hours a day on?\" the two wrote.\n\nSome critics have compared the ban to a bill of attainder, given it singles\nout one company. In an interview with CNBC, Helberg said the comparison did\nnot apply.\n\n\"We have a long tradition in American policymaking \u2014 sometimes we do target\nindividual companies, when national security is at stake,\" Helberg said. The\nbill, which was overwhelmingly passed by the House in March, would demand that\nBytedance either find a buyer for TikTok or else face a ban in the U.S.\n\nBytedance is not sitting on the sidelines, however. The company mobilized its\nuser base to oppose the House bill, urging its millions of users to call their\ncongressional representatives and voice their opposition. The in-app\nnotifications prompted a flood of phone calls that overwhelmed some\ncongressional offices.\n\nHelberg said the effort was a prime example of the risk TikTok posed. \"It was\na live demo of precisely the kinds of concerns that we have been trying to\nhighlight to elected officials,\" he told CNBC. \"All of these concerns that\nbefore were theoretical were highlighted in full Technicolor for everyone to\nsee.\"\n\nKhosla is founder of Khosla Ventures and was co-founder of Sun Microsystems.\nHelberg is a senior advisor at Palantir, an artificial intelligence firm that\ndoes extensive government contracting work, including with the U.S. Department\nof Defense.\n\nBoth are also deeply involved with the Hill and Valley Forum, a working group\nfirst convened in 2023 to combat the influence of the Chinese government and\nTikTok in the U.S. Hill and Valley is slated to reconvene in May.\n\nTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew has also been lobbying D.C. lawmakers against a ban,\nmeeting with Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., in March.\n\n## Battle lines drawn\n\nShou Zi Chew, CEO of TikTok, speaks to reporters outside the office of Sen.\nJohn Fetterman (D-PA) at the Russell Senate Office Building on March 14, 2024\nin Washington, DC. The House of Representatives voted to ban TikTok in the\nUnited States unless the Chinese-owned parent company ByteDance sells the\npopular video app within the next six months.\n\nAnna Moneymaker | Getty Images\n\nWhile the letter was addressed to all senators, Helberg said that he hoped in\nparticular that Sens. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Maria Cantwell, D-Wash.,\nwould take notice. Schumer is Senate majority leader and Cantwell is the chair\nof the Senate Commerce Committee.\n\nBut TikTok has seemingly received apparent support from an unexpected source:\nformer President Donald Trump. One week after Trump met with top Republican\ndonor and Bytedance investor Jeff Yass, the former president indicated he was\nopposed to a TikTok ban, saying it would give too much advantage to Meta,\nwhich owns Instagram.\n\nHelberg said that he didn't think Trump was fully opposed to Khosla and his\nefforts. \"If you look at his statements, he has expressed very strong concerns\nabout bias and censorship against conservative voices online,\" Helberg told\nCNBC. Trump is the presumptive 2024 Republican nominee for president.\n\nNonetheless, Trump's commentary, paired with opposition from China's Foreign\nMinistry, has raised questions about whether a divestiture is even feasible.\nChina has said that it is completely opposed to the sale of TikTok, which\nwould require an export license from the government. That opposition, Khosla\nand Helberg wrote, \"tells you what you need to know: TikTok is a 'key\npolitical asset,' not a commercial enterprise.\"\n\nTop investors, including former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and former\nActivision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick, are among those circling the app, which\nwould likely carry a price in the tens of billions of dollars.\n\nWhen asked what the odds between a divestiture and a ban would be, Helberg\ndemurred.\n\n\"If the Chinese Communist Party operates in good faith and lives up to its\nclaims, a divestiture will happen in an orderly manner,\" he said. \"There are\nlots of willing buyers in the United States.\"\n\nTikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n## Don\u2019t miss these exclusives from CNBC PRO\n\n  * Friday's biggest analyst calls: Apple, Amazon, Tesla, Microsoft, Boeing, First Solar, Schwab & more\n  * Citi says this \u2018high risk\u2019 but \u2018attractive\u2019 global stock has 280% upside\n  * This AI stock could fall 50% and has an \u2018exaggerated artificial intelligence narrative,\u2019 Morningstar says\n  * Morgan Stanley names 3 overlooked global tech stocks, giving one almost 100% upside\n\nWATCH: Former Treasury Secretary Mnuchin says he's building investor group to\nacquire TikTok\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO7:4207:42\n\nFormer Treasury Secretary Mnuchin: I'm going to put together a group to buy\nTikTok\n\nSquawk Box\n\n  * Subscribe to CNBC PRO\n  * Subscribe to Investing Club\n  * Licensing & Reprints\n  * CNBC Councils\n  * Supply Chain Values\n  * CNBC on Peacock\n  * Join the CNBC Panel\n  * Digital Products\n  * News Releases\n  * Closed Captioning\n  * Corrections\n  * About CNBC\n  * Internships\n  * Site Map\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Careers\n  * Help\n  * Contact\n\n  * #### News Tips\n\nGot a confidential news tip?
