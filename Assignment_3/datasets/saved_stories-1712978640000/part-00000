The extent of the compromise, along with the ease of exploitation, has\nearned the CVE-2024-3400 vulnerability the maximum severity rating of 10.0.\nThe ongoing attacks are the latest in a rash of attacks aimed at firewalls,\nVPNs, and file-transfer appliances, which are popular targets because of their\nwealth of vulnerabilities and direct pipeline into the most sensitive parts of\na network.\n\n## \u201cHighly capable\u201d UTA0218 likely to be joined by others\n\nThe zero-day is present in PAN-OS 10.2, PAN-OS 11.0, and/or PAN-OS 11.1\nfirewalls when they are configured to use both the GlobalProtect gateway and\ndevice telemetry. Palo Alto Networks has yet to patch the vulnerability but is\nurging affected customers to follow the workaround and mitigation guidance\nprovided here. The advice includes enabling Threat ID 95187 for those with\nsubscriptions to the company\u2019s Threat Prevention service and ensuring\nvulnerability protection has been applied to their GlobalProtect interface.\nWhen that\u2019s not possible, customers should temporarily disable telemetry until\na patch is available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVolexity, the security firm that discovered the zero-day attacks, said that\nit\u2019s currently unable to tie the attackers to any previously known groups.\nHowever, based on the resources required and the organizations targeted, they\nare \"highly capable\" and likely backed by a nation-state. So far, only a\nsingle threat group\u2014which Volexity tracks as UTA0218\u2014is known to be leveraging\nthe vulnerability in limited attacks. The company warned that as new groups\nlearn of the vulnerability, CVE-2024-3400, is likely to come under mass\nexploitation, just as recent zero-days affecting products from the likes of\nIvanti, Atlassian, Citrix, and Progress have in recent months.\n\n\u201cAs with previous public disclosures of vulnerabilities in these kinds of\ndevices, Volexity assesses that it is likely a spike in exploitation will be\nobserved over the next few days by UTA0218 and potentially other threat actors\nwho may develop exploits for this vulnerability,\u201d company researchers wrote\nFriday. \u201cThis spike in activity will be driven by the urgency of this window\nof access closing due to mitigations and patches being deployed. It is\ntherefore imperative that organizations act quickly to deploy recommended\nmitigations and perform compromise reviews of their devices to check whether\nfurther internal investigation of their networks is required.\u201d\n\nThe earliest attacks Volexity has seen took place on March 26 in what company\nresearchers suspect was UTA0218 testing the vulnerability by placing zero-byte\nfiles on firewall devices to validate exploitability. On April 7, the\nresearchers observed the group trying unsuccessfully to install a backdoor on\na customer\u2019s firewall. Three days later, the group\u2019s attacks were successfully\ndeploying malicious payloads. Since then, the threat group has deployed\ncustom, never-before-seen post-exploitation malware. The backdoor, which is\nwritten in the Python language, allows the attackers to use specially crafted\nnetwork requests to execute additional commands on hacked devices.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How Scientists Respond to Science Deniers\n\n#### reader comments\n\n12\n\nDan Goodin Dan Goodin is Senior Security Editor at Ars Technica, where he\noversees coverage of malware, computer espionage, botnets, hardware hacking,\nencryption, and passwords.

This is gonna be a mess.\n\nIt is. However the affected PAN-OS versions are relatively new and probably\ndeployed \"only\" on a smallish subset of appliances. My company has\npurposefully stayed relatively further back on the release trains, while I\nhave to assume that numerous others are more deploy-once-and-patch-never-or-\nonly-when-forced.\n\nApril 12, 2024 at 9:57 pm\n\n### Channel Ars Technica\n\n#### Unsolved Mysteries Of Quantum Leap With Donald P.
