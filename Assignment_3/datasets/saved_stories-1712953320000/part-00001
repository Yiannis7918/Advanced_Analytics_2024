But as a\ncomputational complexity theorist, he doesn\u2019t necessarily care about the\nanswers to these problems. He often just wants to know if they\u2019re solvable or\nnot, and how to tell. \u201cThe situation is ridiculous,\u201d said Wigderson, a\ncomputer scientist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New\nJersey. No matter how hard a question seems, an efficient way to answer it\ncould be hiding just out of reach. \u201cAs far as we know, for every problem that\nwe face and try to solve, we can\u2019t rule out that it has an algorithm that can\nsolve it. This is the single most interesting problem for me.\u201d\n\nToday Wigderson was named the winner of the A.M. Turing Award, widely\nconsidered one of the top honors in computer science, for his foundational\ncontributions to the theory of computation. Wigderson\u2019s work has touched\nnearly every area of the field. His colleagues, collaborators, and mentees say\nhe consistently finds unexpected bridges between disparate areas. And his work\non randomness and computation, starting in the 1990s, revealed deep\nconnections between mathematics and computer science that underlie today\u2019s\ninvestigations.\n\nAbstractions navigates promising ideas in science and mathematics.

That work launched Sudan\u2019s\nentire career. \u201cThis is typical for Avi,\u201d said Sudan. \u201cHe gets into some\nspace, he asks the right questions, and then he moves on.\u201d\n\nWigderson grew up in Haifa, Israel, as one of three sons of a nurse and an\nelectrical engineer, both survivors of the Holocaust. His father loved puzzles\nand was intensely interested in fundamental ideas in math, which he shared\nwith his children. \u201cHe\u2019s the guy from whom I was infected by this virus,\u201d\nWigderson said. When he started college in the 1970s, at the Technion in\nHaifa, he wanted to major in math, but his parents steered him instead to\ncomputer science. \u201cThey thought maybe it was a good idea that I would have a\njob when I\u2019m done,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this article\n\nCopied!\n\nNewsletter\n\nGet Quanta Magazine delivered to your inbox\n\nRecent newsletters\n\nWigderson sits in a library at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nTalia Herman for Quanta Magazine\n\n## Introduction\n\nHe found a field rich with deep, unanswered questions that were mathematical\nat heart. One of his earliest groundbreaking efforts focused on a seeming\ncontradiction: whether it was possible to convince someone else that a\nmathematical statement had been proved without showing how.\n\n\u201cThe person who sees the proof doesn\u2019t learn anything about the proof itself,\u201d\nsaid Ran Raz, a computer scientist at Princeton University. In 1985, Shafi\nGoldwasser, Silvio Micali, and Charles Rackoff introduced this concept of\nzero-knowledge interactive proofs, demonstrating its use for a few statements.\nWigderson, along with Micali and Oded Goldreich, later expounded on that idea,\nlaying out the conditions showing that if a statement can be proved, it also\nhas a zero-knowledge proof.\n\n\u201cThis is a key result in cryptography; it\u2019s extremely central,\u201d Raz said.\nUsing a zero-knowledge proof, someone can prove they correctly encrypted or\nsigned a message using their secret key, without revealing any information\nabout it. \u201cAvi has some extremely important results in cryptography, and this\nmay be the most important of them.\u201d\n\nThough he made contributions to various fields within computer science,\nWigderson\u2019s work connecting randomness to hard problems may be his most\nsignificant.\n\nTalia Herman for Quanta Magazine\n\nBut perhaps Wigderson\u2019s most foundational result lies in another area: linking\ncomputational hardness to randomness. By the late 1970s, computer scientists\nhad realized that for many hard problems, algorithms that employed randomness,\nalso called probabilistic algorithms, could vastly outcompete their\ndeterministic alternatives. In a 1977 proof, for example, Robert Solovay and\nVolker Strassen introduced a randomized algorithm that could determine whether\na number is prime faster than the best deterministic algorithms of that time.\n\nFor some problems, probabilistic algorithms can point to deterministic ones.\nIn the early 1980s, Wigderson worked with Richard Karp of the University of\nCalifornia, Berkeley, to connect the idea of randomness to problems considered\ncomputationally hard, which means no known deterministic algorithms can solve\nthem in a reasonable amount of time. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how to prove they\u2019re\nhard,\u201d Wigderson said. However, he and Karp found a randomized algorithm to a\ncertain hard problem that they were later able to derandomize, effectively\nuncovering a deterministic algorithm for it. Around the same time, other\nresearchers showed how computational hardness assumptions in cryptography\nproblems could enable derandomization in general.\n\nThe unreasonable effectiveness of randomness led him to think about the nature\nof randomness itself. He, like other researchers at the time, questioned how\nnecessary it was for efficient problem-solving and under what conditions it\ncould be eliminated altogether. \u201cInitially, it was not clear if this was only\nour own stupidity, that we cannot remove randomness,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the larger\nquestion was whether randomness can always be eliminated efficiently or not.\u201d\nHe realized that the need for randomness was intimately tied to the\ncomputational difficulty of the problem.\n\nFor a 1994 paper, he and the computer scientist Noam Nisan illuminated that\nconnection. They proved that if any natural hard problems exist, as most\ncomputer scientists suspect, then every efficient randomized algorithm can be\nreplaced by an efficient deterministic one. \u201cYou can always eliminate\nrandomness,\u201d Wigderson said.\n\nFor Wigderson, it\u2019s always a good time to study computational complexity. \u201cThe\nfield is just blossoming, and beautifully.\u201d\n\nTalia Herman for Quanta Magazine\n\n## Introduction\n\nImportantly, they found that deterministic algorithms may use \u201cpseudorandom\u201d\nsequences \u2014 strings of data that appear random but aren\u2019t. They also showed\nhow any hard problems can be used to build a pseudorandom generator. Feeding\nthe pseudorandom bits (instead of the random ones) into a probabilistic\nalgorithm will result in an efficient deterministic one for the same problem.\n\nSudan said that paper helped computer scientists recognize degrees of\nrandomness that could help reveal the intricacies of hard problems and how to\nsolve them. \u201cIt\u2019s not just randomness but perceptions of randomness,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the key.\u201d\n\nSudan points out that randomness seems to appear everywhere but is, in truth,\nextremely hard to find. \u201cPeople tell you that the digits of pi look random, or\nthe sequence of numbers that are prime looks random,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are\ncompletely determined, but they appear random to us.\u201d The perception of\nrandomness, he said, lies at the heart of computer science today. \u201cAnd that is\nsomething that Avi has promoted vastly.\u201d\n\n## Related:\n\n  1. ### How Do You Prove a Secret?\n\n  2. ### How Randomness Improves Algorithms\n\n  3. ### The Researcher Who Explores Computation by Conjuring New Worlds\n\n  4. ### Pioneers Linking Math and Computer Science Win the Abel Prize\n\nRandomness has become a powerful resource in complexity theory, but it\u2019s\nelusive. Coin flips and dice rolls, Wigderson points out, aren\u2019t truly random:\nIf you have enough information about the physical system, then the result is\nentirely predictable. Perfect randomness, he said, is elusive and hard to\nverify.\n\nBut for Wigerson, examples of computing are everywhere \u2014 not just within\nsmartphones and laptops and encryption algorithms but in biological and\nphysical systems as well. In recent decades, findings from the theory of\ncomputation have yielded insights into a range of unexpected problems, from\nswarming birds and election outcomes to biochemical reactions in the body.\n\u201cBasically, any natural process is an evolution which you can view as\ncomputation, so you can study it as such. Almost everything computes.\u201d\n\nCorrection: April 10, 2024\n\nThe original version of this article said Wigderson attended the University of\nHaifa.
