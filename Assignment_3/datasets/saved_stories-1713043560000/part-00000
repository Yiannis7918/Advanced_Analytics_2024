Books and programs abound that\nwill guide the seeker in cultivating Stoic disciplines or applying Peripatetic\ncodes. Ovid can help you move on after a breakup. Pliny can advise you about\nmanaging your wealth. Cicero will improve your humor or electability, while\nPlutarch will sharpen your leadership skills. Horace will help you find\ncontentment, and Galen will offer you the benefits of ancient medicine.\nPrinceton University Press began issuing selections of Greek and Latin texts\nin new translations in 2012; the pace of publication has recently quickened.\nTop classicists such as James Romm and Stephen Harrison will serve as your\nguides. Most of the thirty-one books the press has released so far are\ntherapeutic in purpose, although some\u2014How to Stop a Conspiracy or How to Run a\nCountry\u2014could help you help others, or perhaps even save liberal democracy.\n\nUnlike the titles in the Princeton series, many of today\u2019s Stoic initiation\nbooks offer not only timely advice but also a new way to live. One prolific\nauthor, philosopher Massimo Pigliucci, describes his journey to Stoicism as\nhappening \u201cnot by way of Damascus\u201d or through the study of classics but as\nresult of his long search for \u201cmore coherent ways to understand the world\n(through science) and better choices for living my life (through philosophy).\u201d\nHaving been turned away from his Catholicism by Bertrand Russell, Pigliucci\nfound in Stoicism a \u201cmetaphysics with a spiritual dimension\u201d that is\n\u201ceminently practical\u201d\u2014a \u201cdynamic combination of reflecting on theoretical\nprecepts, reading inspirational texts, and engaging in meditation,\nmindfulness, and other spiritual exercises.\u201d^11xMassimo Pigliucci, How to Be a\nStoic: Ancient Wisdom for Modern Living (London, England: Rider Books, 2017),\n2\u20136.\n\nProvided with a diverse menu of Western and other ethical traditions and\naccepting the common assumption that human progress will extend indefinitely,\nwhy are so many people now returning to ancient sources, even if they can be\nharmonized with the late modern world as \u201crational\u201d and \u201ccompatible with\nscience\u201d? Part of the answer lies in the thinness of ethical life in the\ntwenty-first century, reduced as so much of it is to calculations of utility\nand the maximization of individual happiness. Aristotle and the writer of\nProverbs were among the first to notice that the enabling moral quality of\ncourage requires hope. Why risk anything if we have no faith that we are\nheaded somewhere worth going to? Reflecting on that theme in his 2000 book The\nReal American Dream: A Meditation on Hope, literary scholar Andrew Delbanco\ndescribes the gradual diminution of a nation\u2019s cultural resources:\n\n> In the first phase of our [American] civilization, hope was chiefly\n> expressed through a Christian story that gave meaning to suffering and\n> pleasure alike and promised deliverance from death. This story held the\n> imagination largely without challenge for two hundred years. In the second\n> phase, as Christianity came under pressure from Enlightenment rationality,\n> the promise of self-realization was transformed into the idea of citizenship\n> in a sacred union.... Finally, in the third phase\u2014our own\u2014the idea of\n> transcendence has detached itself from any coherent symbology. It continues\n> to be pursued through New Age spirituality, apocalyptic environmentalism,\n> and the \u201cmulticultural\u201d search for ancestral roots; but our most conspicuous\n> symbols...are the logos of corporate advertising. Though vivid and\n> ubiquitous, such symbols will never deliver the indispensable feeling that\n> the world does not end at the borders of the self.^22xAndrew Delbanco, The\n> Real American Dream: A Meditation on Hope (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University\n> Press, 1999), 4\u20135.\n\nIn the twentieth century, the self came to define the goals of nearly all\naspects of life: Our careers had to be fulfilling, our marriages had to bring\nhappiness, our religious experiences had to be part of our self-improvement\nprojects, our children became our friends, our communities and our service to\nthem had to give us satisfaction, and our causes often became expressions of\nour ever-changing identitarian commitments. Yet what Robert Bellah called\n\u201cexpressive individualism,\u201d Charles Taylor named the \u201cauthentic self,\u201d and\nAlasdair MacIntyre labeled \u201cemotivism\u201d has not proved satisfactory.^33xRobert\nN. Bellah et al., Habits of the Heart: Individualism and Commitment in\nAmerican Life (New York, NY: Harper & Row, 1985); Charles Taylor, The Ethics\nof Authenticity (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2018); Alasdair\nMacIntyre, After Virtue: A Study in Moral Theory (Notre Dame, IN: University\nof Notre Dame, 1981). We are left longing for a more substantial ethical\nfoundation, if not for ourselves, then for our children, whose largely skills-\nbased education leaves them ill equipped to handle lives increasingly lived\nonline, where anger, shaming, posturing, envy, and pornography reduce the\nhuman to the most instrumental, transactional, and consumerist terms.\n\n## Formation in Antiquity\n\nThe histories and literatures of antiquity can help us address some of our\ncontemporary ethical deficit disorder. But even if we find contemporary\nsources of ethical formation sorely wanting, or even largely replaced by\ntherapeutic and psychologistic nostrums of \u201cgrit\u201d and \u201cresilience,\u201d we should\nbeware of imposing our own understandings on the ancients who could help us.\nFormation in antiquity was grounded in cultural and historical realities that\nare a world apart from late modern ones.\n\nTo begin with, the ancient models, Greek and Roman, at least, emerged from\nworlds marked by vast social differences that included staggering wealth\ndisparities. Enslaved persons accounted for perhaps 10 percent of the\npopulation in the Roman world; according to historian Kyle Harper, in Rome, \u201ca\nstrong component of slave-based agricultural production\u201d added to \u201cextensive\nlevels of household slavery.\u201d^44xKyle Harper, Slavery in the Late Roman World,\nAD 275\u2013425 (Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 2011), 61.\nLiteracy in the ancient world was rare, perhaps not exceeding 20 percent for\nmales, though, as we will see, this did not stunt all moral and civic\nformation for non-elite Greeks and Romans.\n\nEarly formation in this world occurred primarily in the household; literate\nand numerate education for a public career drew from a classical canon aimed\nat humanitas or paideia; education from the most rudimentary forms to the\nhighest levels of the ethical schools aimed to shape the body and the soul\u2014the\n\u201cwhole person,\u201d in our parlance\u2014for full participation in the life of one\u2019s\nhousehold, religion, and political community. Recall that Socrates was tried\nand martyred for corrupting the young. Institutions and their leaders were\neager to pass on \u201ctheir social and intellectual nature...by exercising the\nqualities through which they created it,\u201d^55xWerner Jaeger, Paideia: The\nIdeals of Greek Culture, trans. Gilbert Highet, vol. 1: Archaic Greece, The\nMind of Athens (New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 1965), xiii. the\nphilosopher Werner Jaeger aptly noted, and aligning those institutions and\nmessages, despite philosophical differences, was a preoccupation across the\nsocioeconomic spectrum, as recently uncovered evidence of popular Roman\nmorality shows.\n\nAristotle and his predecessors, Socrates and Plato, are typically considered\nto have led the way in theorizing ethical formation. Aristotle\u2019s theory of\nvirtue\u2014that excellence can be found at the mean between two extremes, which\none reaches by habitually choosing the right action for the right reasons at\nthe right time with the right emotions\u2014serves as a paradigm from or against\nwhich most other theories either derive or react. Indeed, Aristotle\u2019s theory\nderives not only from his heroic teacher and mentor, Plato, as is commonly\nrecognized, but also from an antecedent culture that has been too little\nappreciated.\n\nAristotle spent some twenty years of his life, starting at age seventeen,\nunder Plato\u2019s tutelage. Familiarity with Plato\u2019s dialogues was a price of\nentry to the Lyceum or to Peripatos, as Aristotle\u2019s own school was known. (Its\nadherents were called Peripatetics.) And though Aristotle rarely referred\ndirectly to them, he certainly addressed the topics and questions raised in\nthe Dialogues. \u201cThe men who introduced the Ideas are friends of mine,\u201d he said\nin the Nicomachean Ethics (1.6.1), and elsewhere he observed that Plato had\n\u201cproved it clearly...by his own way of living and his methods of reasoning\nthat man\u2019s goodness and happiness come together.\u201d^66xThe translations in this\nsentence are from Carlo Natali and D.S. Hutchinson, Aristotle: His Life and\nSchool (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2013), 21. The second\nquotation is from Elegiacs to Eudemus; the referent is Plato as argued\nconclusively in R. Renehan, \u201cAristotle\u2019s Elegiacs to Eudemus (Fr. 673 Rose 3 =\nOlymp. in Pl. \u2018Gorg.\u2019 Comm. p. 214. 25 Ff. Westerink),\u201d Illinois Classical\nStudies 16, no. 1/2 (1991): 259\u201360.\n\nFollowing in the tradition of apprenticing himself to a famous philosopher,\nPlato\u2019s star pupil would have known his teacher\u2019s conduct very well, as indeed\nPlato would have known Socrates\u2019s way of life or the apostles knew Jesus\u2019s.\nThis ancient pedagogy is characteristic of oral cultures in which, as Philip\nRieff observed, \u201cknowledge is personal, inward, and best conveyed in\nconversation\u2014the most civilized art of transaction\u2014between persons and, not\nleast in schools, across generations.\u201d^77xPhilip Rieff, The Feeling Intellect:\nSelected Writings, ed. Jonathan B. Imber (Chicago, IL: University of Chicago\nPress, 1991), 371. Certain kinds of content and learning exercises can be\neffectively delivered through technology, i.e., means that do not require\nhuman-to-human interaction. But character certainly cannot be formed entirely\nthrough technology, though certain aspects of moral knowledge, stories, and\nauthoritative quotations might be available via such media. Formally called\nmaieutic, this form of pedagogy derives its name and meaning from the Greek\nword for \u201cmidwife\u201d or \u201cbringing forth.\u201d It aims at bringing another into\nbeing. In the dialogue with fellow philosophers in Plato\u2019s Theaetetus,\nSocrates said of his pupils, \u201cI watch over the labor of their souls, not their\nbodies.\u201d^88xPlato, Theaetetus, ed.

For a discussion, see\nFiona Leigh, \u201cPlatonic Dialogue, Maieutic Method and Critical Thinking,\u201d\nJournal of Philosophy of Education 41, no. 3 (January 23, 2008): 309\u201323,\nhttps://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9752.2007.00561.x.\n\nThe most famous ancient work on formation, Aristotle\u2019s second treatise on\nethics, received its name (at some point) from that of the philosopher\u2019s son,\nNicomachus, who was still young when Aristotle died. Like his works on the\nnatural world, metaphysics, politics, and literary theory, Aristotle\u2019s work on\nethics was the fruit of a philosophical way of life. Schole, or leisure, was\nthe essential component. Those hours of the day free of work or other\npreoccupations, schole demonstrated the \u201cmeaning we wish to give our lives\u201d\nand \u201cwhat sort of person we are,\u201d as Aristotle\u2019s recent biographer Carlo\nNatali puts it,^99xNatali and Hutchinson, Aristotle, 66. or \u201cfreedom from ...\nlife\u2019s necessities,...from worries and cares,\u201d in Hannah Arendt\u2019s\nformulation.^1010xHannah Arendt, Danielle S. Allen, and Margaret Canovan, The\nHuman Condition, second edition (Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press,\n2018), 14n10. Aristotle\u2019s idea of flourishing derived from examining the\nobservations and expert opinions he had gathered and expounded about the\nnature of the good life. In no small way, Aristotle chose this life for\nhimself. But the life of theoria was at least equally social: an expression of\nhis noble family line\u2014especially his mother\u2019s\u2014that was enjoyed among friends\nand advanced students, passed down to his intellectual descendants as to\nfamily.\n\nThe more decisive formative influence was Greek culture itself. Greek\nintellectual and cultural achievements, not least in ethics and politics,\nwere, as the historian Victor Davis Hanson argues in his pathbreaking book The\nOther Greeks, \u201cthe logical fruit of the groundwork of agrarians, Greek farmers\nwho are now all but lost to the European historical record.\u201d^1111xVictor Davis\nHanson, The Other Greeks: The Family Farm and the Agrarian Roots of Western\nCivilization (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1999), 406. First\npublished 1995.\n\nThe small farms that sprawled across the Hellenic countryside produced olives,\ncereals, livestock, figs, vines, and fruit. With a certain measure of\nneighborliness and collaboration, the ethos and practices of these households\nenabled them to become self-supporting and crisis resistant, qualities that\nalso contributed to the foundations of a polis, a community that centered on a\nshared civic, political, and commercial life. The military defense of the\npolis was provided by the same farmers, the famous heavily armed \u201choplites\u201d\nwho preferred decisive engagements via frontal assaults. Each town had a\npolity that was relatively broad-based (if not a pure democracy, as in\nAthens), and attempted to represent the economic interests of most landowner-\ncitizens with a system of laws. Those with power were typically landowners,\nwho profited from the labor of enslaved people, typically (if any) one or two\nper household, as well as that of wives, sisters, and other female relatives,\nand children. Each of these dependents, in turn, benefited from the\nhouseholder\u2019s political membership and military service. The Greek city-states\ncould be surrounded by networks of town-and-countryside communities that led\nto \u201cthe emergence of a new sort of person for whom work was not merely a means\nof subsistence or profit but an ennobling way of life, a crucible of moral\nexcellence in which pragmatism, moderation, and a search for proportion were\nthe fundamental values,\u201d^1212xIbid., 3. not least because life\u2019s\ncircumstances, like human nature itself, could be tragic and unpredictable.\n\nSuch a way of life required independence and self-sufficiency within an\ninstitutional and cultural context of interdependence and mutual interest. The\nformation of children and of civic leaders necessarily reflected these\nrealities. \u201cEducation is not a practice which concerns the individual alone:\nit is essentially a function of the community,\u201d wrote Werner Jaeger. \u201cThe\ncharacter of the community is expressed in the individuals who compose it,\u201d\nand \u201cthe community is the source of all behavior,\u201d to such an extent that,\naccording to Jaeger\u2019s deeply learned account, \u201cthe Greek mind owes its\nsuperior strength to the fact that it was deeply rooted in the life of the\ncommunity.\u201d Greek education, like its ancient successors, reflected the\ninescapable belief that human beings are essentially \u201cof the polis\u201d\n(political), and the goal of that education was to create a \u201csupra-personal\nlife\u201d in the \u201cimage of the community\u201d rather than \u201ca perfect independent\npersonality.\u201d As such, education began not with the individual but with\nhumanitas, the ideal of genuine human natures.^1313xJaeger, Paideia, xiii\u2013xiv,\nxxv\u2013xxvi.\n\nIt was this standard of humanitas that the intellectuals and artists who\nemerged from the Greek poleis strove to understand, achieve, and uphold. Such\na seed would have failed to flower into the cultural achievements in the arts,\nliterature, philosophy, science, and law had it not been, Hanson argues, for\nthe middle-class farmers who \u201cprovided the capital, the security, the freedom,\nthe entire backdrop for a curious few [intellectuals] to enhance, to question,\nto nuance, and to transform their own fundamentally sound agrarian political,\nsocial, and military thinking.\u201d^1414xHanson, The Other Greeks, 406.\n\nTo interpret the Greek ethicists without accounting for this background is to\ndisembed the philosophical from the practical and run the risk of distorting\nthe meaning of the good life. The paradigmatic experience of the Greek middle\nclass pointed to the importance of industriousness in service to and full\nparticipation in the life of the polis. The introduction of private property,\nthe innovation needed to enhance it, the ability to pass it on as an\ninheritance, and a commitment to supporting the common good heightened the\nneed to form the kinds of people whose hard work could instill industriousness\nas perhaps the paramount virtue. This way of life required a certain kind of\nperson.\n\n## The Habit of Virtue\n\nAlthough industriousness does not appear on Aristotle\u2019s list of twelve or so\nvirtues in books 3 and 4 of the Nicomachean Ethics, most, if not all, of the\nvirtues can be read as compatible with this ideal, notably the two related to\none\u2019s wealth, liberality and munificence, both of which are aimed at avoiding\nwastefulness and stinginess, the better to benefit one\u2019s fellow citizens.\n\nCourage, for example, is best demonstrated not in premeditated actions based\non reasoned calculation but, rather, in unforeseen circumstances. Temperance\nconcerns one\u2019s relationship to pleasure and pain, especially in regard to\nthings that are conducive to \u201chealth or vigor,\u201d which have a functional cast\nto them, and, when pursued in order to acquire other pleasant things, should\nnot be ignoble or prodigal. Aristotle focuses the virtues concerned with\nhonor\u2014magnanimity and ambition\u2014on a proper evaluation of oneself and one\u2019s\nrelation to others, both what one is due and what is noble to aspire to.\nNeither vanity nor groveling humility is acceptable. So, also, one should be\nappropriately angry, truthful, adequately social, and modest with respect to\nshame. The intellectual virtues were equally at home in the Lyceum or on the\nfarm or battlefield, and phronesis\u2014practical wisdom\u2014concerns both the\nmanagement of one\u2019s household (oikonomia), based on one\u2019s own interests as\nlearned through experience and the management of the political community.\n\nThus, Aristotle\u2019s taxonomy is both practical and theoretical. It steers a\nmiddling course likely neither to cause one to damage oneself nor to\nantagonize others. Much in line with the tradition of the Greek farmers whom\nhe knew well, the Athenian leader Solon defined eudaimonia, Aristotle says, as\nliving temperately with modest means.^1515xAristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, book\n10, ch. 8, section 13, G.P. Goold, ed. (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University\nPress, 1975). In the same vein, several centuries later Plutarch holds out the\nideal of mixing the practical and the contemplative as the paradigm for\neducation.^1616xPlutarch, Moralia I: The Education of Children, chapter 8,\nJeffrey Henderson, ed. (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1927).\n\nIndeed, Aristotle\u2019s ethical course was oriented toward eudaimonia, human\nflourishing\u2014a soul activity in accordance with complete virtue, living well\nand acting well\u2014in ways that require sufficient resources, but the\ncompleteness of one\u2019s virtue and the result of one\u2019s efforts to do well could\nbe fully known only after one\u2019s death. Often glossed today as happiness,\neudaimonia is discussed by Socrates, who, according to a passage in Plato\u2019s\nEuthydemus, argued that all human beings wish to do well.^1717xPlato,\nEuthydemus, lines 278e2\u2013279a1, in Platonis Opera, John Burnet, ed. (Oxford,\nEngland: Oxford University Press, 1903). Eudaimonia, then, is \u201ca name for our\nreal interest and what all human action intends to pursue or\nachieve.\u201d^1818xNicholas D. Smith, Socrates on Self-Improvement: Knowledge,\nVirtue, and Happiness (Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 2023),\n39. First published 2021. Plato himself stands in marked contrast, assuming\nthat philosophy alone \u201cis able to advance integrative unity both in the\nindividual and the state and to the achievement of the ideal.... Popular or\npolitical virtue...is unstable and unreliable.\u201d^1919xLloyd P. Gerson, Plato\u2019s\nMoral Realism (New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 2023), 226. For\nPlato, virtue exerts a \u201ctransformative power\u201d on our understanding of\nhappiness and on the whole self, philosopher Julia Annas argues, because it is\n\u201cdeeply rooted,\u201d not merely a practical habit.^2020xJulia Annas, Platonic\nEthics, Old and New (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1999), 49\u201350.\n\nWhether the practice of virtue was deeply rooted, habitual, or something else,\nthe agrarian backdrop also reminds us that ancient ethics was a bios, a way of\nlife. The major ethical schools bear this out. Stoicism aimed at human\nflourishing but attempted to accommodate the reality that virtuous action did\nnot always lead to achievement of one\u2019s goal. Circumstances could often be\noutside one\u2019s control; those external goods that Aristotle saw as necessary\ncould deprive one of virtue, such that one could be at the mercy of fate\nunless one could adapt emotionally to achieve a state of tranquility\nregardless of external factors. Pythagoreanism required five years of\nprobation and adoption of a rigorous lifestyle of common property,\nunconditional loyalty, and dietary restrictions. Epicureanism, too, involved\nliving in community, and the members of such a community pursued\neudaimonia\u2014understood as achieving the greatest good, pleasure, and avoiding\nevil, pain\u2014to arrive at a divinely blissful state. Halfhearted efforts would\nnot have fit.\n\nAmong such ethical schools, moral odysseys were not unknown. Consider Flavius\nJosephus, who tells in his Vita that he experimented with three of the major\nJewish schools (Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenes); or Augustine, who\njourneyed from Manicheanism to Christian orthodoxy with guidance from Ambrose,\nmuch to the delight of his mother, Monica; or Gregory the Great (d. 604 AD),\nwhose modal shifts took him from the vita activa to the vita contemplativa to\nthe \u201cmixed life.\u201d\n\n## Schools of Thought\n\nThese ethical schools can be viewed as the end of formation, a summit achieved\nby only a handful of those who began learning their letters around age seven.\nThe adherents to these ways of life were mostly the wealthy and mostly men,\nwith some notable exceptions. Like other schools, Aristotle\u2019s Peripatos\ndepended on a foundation to provide it with the resources it needed to support\nresearch, buildings, and libraries. \u201cThe philosophical life is not for\neveryone,\u201d Charles Taylor observes, \u201cbut at the same time it amounts to the\nfullest realization of the nature which all human beings share.\u201d^2121xCharles\nTaylor, \u201cWhat Was the Axial Revolution?,\u201d in The Axial Age and Its\nConsequences, ed. Robert N. Bellah and Hans Joas (Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press\nof Harvard University Press, 2012), 37.\n\nBack down in the foothills of learning, throughout most of the ancient Greek\nand Roman worlds, the children of sufficiently well-off citizens (mostly boys,\nbut sometimes girls) were provided with a pedagogue who served as chauffeur,\neducational recruiter, protector, tutor, character mentor, and\ntroubleshooter\u2014something like an au pair. His educational efforts would be\ncomplemented by those of a grammarian or private tutor, usually a man, who\nwould teach the children to read and write characters in Latin, Greek, and\nsometimes a local language such as Hebrew, to memorize vocabulary, and to work\nwith passages from Homer, Euripides, Virgil, Hesiod, Isocrates, and Menander,\namong others. On papyrus, students wrote out grammatical exercises,\nmorphological tables, parts of speech, verb conjugations and noun declensions,\nthe origins of words, case usage, and experiments with style in syllabic\nlength, accent usage, and tone. Grammar was important for understanding\nliterary texts and speaking, as well as for writing that should conform to\nstandards of reason, antiquity, authority, and usage, according to the\nhistorian Teresa Morgan.^2222xTeresa Morgan, Literate Education in the\nHellenistic and Roman Worlds, Cambridge Classical Studies (Cambridge/New York:\nCambridge University Press, 1998), 172\u201373, discussion of Quintilian.\n\nThose who kept climbing\u2014almost always boys aged fourteen or fifteen\u2014learned\nrhetoric as a way of preparing for competitive professions and public careers.\nAccording to Libanius, the pupils first learned theory, progressed in the\nsecond year to prose works, then moved on to \u201cpreliminary exercises,\u201d followed\nby two years of composition practice, and may then have assisted with\ninstruction of their juniors.^2323xSee Raffaella Cribiore, Gymnastics of the\nMind: Greek Education in Hellenistic and Roman Egypt, 2nd printing, 1st pbk.\nprinting (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2005), 56. Those who\nwanted a life of philosophy\u2014a Peripatetic, Platonist, a Pythagorean, an\nEpicurean, or, later, a monk\u2014would continue in that \u201cschool\u201d of thought.\n\nThe famed midcentury education historian of antiquity Henri-Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e Marrou\nargued that \u201cla formation du caract\u00e8re\u201d was the essence of ancient education.\nContemporary scholars have agreed. \u201cAll the elements of enkyklios paideia\n[general education] have a part to play in developing virtue,\u201d Teresa Morgan\nwrites, not least in fostering, as historian Rafaella Cribiore has argued, an\n\u201cadmiration of the past\u201d that would lead one to aspire \u201cto model oneself on\none\u2019s predecessors.\u201d^2424xHenri-Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e Marrou, Histoire de l\u2019\u00e9ducation dans\nl\u2019antiquit\u00e9 (Paris, France: \u00c9ditions du Seuil, 1948), 55, cf. 328\u2013329; Morgan,\nLiterate Education in the Hellenistic and Roman Worlds, 228; Cribiore,\nGymnastics of the Mind, 8.\n\n## Practical Wisdom and Those Who Sought It\n\nThe general populace did not lack moral knowledge or practices, as ethical\nwritings on papyrus, pottery, and literary fragments attest.^2525xHere I draw\nextensively on Teresa Morgan, Popular Morality in the Early Roman Empire\n(Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 2009). Indeed, ordinary\npeople appear to have had a great interest in morality. They received,\nrecorded, read, and transmitted their ethics in proverbs, fables, moralistic\nquotations (gnomic sayings), and exemplars. They do not appear to have had\nprecepts culled from Aristotle, the Stoics, or the Cynics rattling around in\ntheir heads. They had little interest in eudaimonia (flourishing) or hedon\u00ea\n(pleasure) as such. Conflict, human frailty, inequality, and fear were taken\nto be life\u2019s normal terms for the middling and lower orders. So friendship,\nsolidarity, generosity, cleverness, and careful trust were common concerns.\nIntelligence was regarded with ambivalence, though it was preferred to\nfoolishness as promoting better social relations. Justice was an ever present\naspiration, as was social unity, self-control, and the imitation of exemplars.\nAvoiding poverty was recommended, but wealth could be tricky and was\nrecognized to take forms other than money, especially having friends.\nPhronesis (practical wisdom) often appears in this literature, but it was\ntypically related to survival rather than being virtuous, powerful, wealthy,\nor fortunate.\n\nPopular moral texts cited several authorities and often invoked the gods:\n\u201cModesty [the divinized virtue] taught the most just men to neglect their\npersonal affairs while desiring the best for public affairs,\u201d reads one such\ntext. \u201cTemples should be built and altars consecrated to her as the mother of\nall good counsel, the guardian of solemn duties, the teacher of innocence.\u201d\nNature, the givenness of things, is another such authority: \u201cIt was in his\nRoman blood to keep the faith...\u201d and \u201cYou were born to be an ass; don\u2019t try\nto impersonate a lion\u201d were two such adages. And there was Cicero\u2019s \u201cBirds of\na feather flock together.\u201d The common sense provided a kind of authority, too,\nperhaps leading one to believe that \u201cthere\u2019s truth in wine\u201d (as we know).\nSocial institutions could be authoritative. One work begins by invoking the\nsecond Roman emperor Tiberius as both a representative of the gods and the\nembodiment of the Roman state: \u201cYou who have been placed in charge of land and\nsea by the collective will of the gods and men, who are the surest salvation\nof our fatherland, by whose celestial providence the virtues of which I shall\nspeak are most graciously fostered and the vices most severely punished.\u201d Then\nthere were ancient myths and regional customs: \u201cA \u2018Boeotian riddle\u2019...is\nanything unintelligible,\u201d it was said; Heracles symbolized strength, Penelope\nfaithfulness, Kronos \u201cfoolish old age,\u201d the Sphinx unintelligibility, and\nAlcestis conjugal affection.^2626xQuotations taken from Morgan, on gods, 208;\non nature, 211, 212; common sense, 213; social institutions, 215; myths,\n216\u2013217. Poets offered a wellspring of moral resources. Euripides, Menander,\nHesiod, and Homer were favorites in Greek; in Latin, Virgil, Terence, and\nPublilius Syrus were commonly invoked in popular morality.\n\n## An Ambient Formation\n\nAncient character formation, in short, involved much more than a single\ninstitution. Attempting to disabuse his readers of their (and our) typical\nmodern Western assumptions, Henri-Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e Marrou wrote, \u201cWe have made the\nschool the decisive factor in education; for the Greeks the decisive factor\nwas the surroundings in which the child grew up\u2014the family, with its servants\nand friends.\u201d^2727xHenri-Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e Marrou, A History of Education in Antiquity,\ntrans. George Lamb (Madison, WI: University of Wisconsin Press, 1982), 221.\nFirst published 1948. The same could be said of the Romans. Indeed, based on\nwider ranging types of evidence and another half century of research, Marrou\nwas more correct than he could have demonstrated.\n\nThe family was decisive. The nuclear family of father, mother, and siblings\nwas stable throughout antiquity, possibly extended with grandparents\n(especially a widowed grandmother) and, in elite households, slaves.\nConventional accounts of parental indifference and coldness in antiquity have\nbeen overdrawn, although power within the family clearly flowed from the\nfather, the kyrios or paterfamilias, who was responsible for income and\nproperty as well as the care of all members, typically including kin.\nHousehold management became the wife\u2019s responsibility, and young girls, who\nsometimes received at least a primary education, were trained in the oversight\nof slaves, expenditures, and textile production, especially of wool, this\nlatter effort eventually yielding a homespun wedding dress, the symbolic\nculmination of preparation for marriage, around age twelve.\n\nAmong nonelite families, children prepared for adulthood by learning to work.\nUnskilled duties on a farm were taken on by children, and as labor became more\nspecialized in the Hellenistic and Roman periods, young people would learn to\nproduce goods, keep a shop, or perform a trade, often training with a\ncraftsman outside the family. This training would typically begin before age\nfourteen and could last from a few months to as many as six years.\n\nHouseholds were embedded in a social and political context. Girls ventured\nfrom home far less than boys, who might spend as many as seven hours a day\naway from the house. Engagement with the community was expected, sometimes in\nthe gymnasium, in the form of participation in sports, military training, and\nsocial relationships. \u201cThe heart of the establishment of the Greek polis was\ncollective action,\u201d historian Ray Laurence has written. So in middle to late\nchildhood, boys throughout Greek and Roman communities participated in clubs\n(the Ephebia, Vereia, or Collegium iuvenum) \u201cas part of the training to become\na citizen\u201d and to move the individual \u201cinto a wider social and civic\nworld...and a sense of belonging to a city.\u201d Young people\u2019s membership on city\ncouncils was possible; for example, six-year-old Numerius Popidius Celsinus\nbecame a Pompeii councilor, and one-fifth of the members of a third-century AD\nItalian town, it was said, \u201cwore the childhood toga.\u201d Whatever the form taken\nby young boys\u2019 municipal service, it might well have been preparation for\nelection to a magistracy as early as age seventeen.^2828xRay Laurence,\n\u201cCommunity,\u201d in A Cultural History of Childhood and Family in Antiquity, ed.\nMary Harlow and Ray Laurence, vol. 1 (London, England: Bloomsbury Academic,\n2014), 34, 38.\n\nGeography and the built environment mattered, of course, not least the house\nwhere a child lived, where moral and social norms were formed. A house itself\nfacilitated public engagement, especially for wealthy families. Most homes\ndidn\u2019t have bathrooms, for example, so bathing itself was a social exercise.\nGreek houses typically had high, windowless walls that closed them off from\nthe public, but also often had courtyards for \u201cchores, storage, and the\nhousehold cult,\u201d as the historian Louise Revell\u2019s synthesis of the\narchaeological and textual evidence has shown. The archetypal Roman atrium\nhouse, Revell notes, \u201cwas organized on a visual axis from the street into the\ndepths of the house...that gave it a physical permeability that echoed the\nintermingling of public and private space\u201d within the home itself. Visible\nfrom the street, the atrium was used to entertain social and political\nfriends. \u201cThese quasi-public spaces were opulently decorated with mosaics,\nwall paintings, and statues,\u201d thus surrounding children in their formative\nyears with the symbols and rituals of an active public life.^2929xLouise\nRevell, \u201cGeography and the Environment,\u201d in A Cultural History of Childhood\nand Family in Antiquity, ed. Mary Harlow and Ray Laurence, vol. 1 (London,\nEngland: Bloomsbury Academic, 2014), 62, 64.\n\nEven though antiquity is known for its great cities, at least three quarters\nof the population in the Greco-Roman world lived in villages and the\ncountryside, according to historian Greg Woolf, author of the monumental The\nLife and Death of Ancient Cities.^3030xGreg Woolf, The Life and Death of\nAncient Cities: A Natural History (Oxford, England: Oxford University Press,\n2020). A recent study by Roman history scholar Peter Thonemann of inscriptions\nfound in a rural region of Roman Asia Minor reveals what was probably common\nbut relatively unacknowledged in the literary or archaeological records: small\ncommunities with simple but vibrant civic structures \u201cwhere every family is\nlarge, tight-knit, and honorable; where village communities stick together;\nwhere even the most disastrous breakdown of relations between men and gods can\nalways be repaired, so long as the transgressor\u2019s [kin] are willing to pull\ntogether to set things right.\u201d^3131xPeter Thonemann, The Lives of Ancient\nVillages: Rural Society in Roman Anatolia (Cambridge, England: Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 2022), 355.\n\nReligion\u2019s importance, though often neglected in the literature on formation,\ncan hardly be overstated. Drawing on evidence from Greek and Roman\ncommunities, the family historian Ville Vuolanto argues that the family was\n\u201cvery much a religious unit,\u201d in which, he writes,\n\n> [l]earning domestic rituals was an important part of the socialization of\n> children... [and] an important way of making social contacts: religious\n> practices constituted the most important way in which children could be\n> visible and interact in public life: \u2018religion provided the main avenue for\n> children into the life of the polis.\u2019 Religious life tied children to their\n> family traditions, to the values and ways of interaction in society, and to\n> the mythic past of their communities, whether Greek polis or Christian\n> ecclesia.^3232xVille Vuolanto, \u201cFaith and Religion,\u201d in A Cultural History\n> of Childhood and Family in Antiquity, ed. Mary Harlow and Ray Laurence, vol.\n> 1 (London, England: Bloomsbury Academic, 2014), 150.\n\nFocused formation in religious institutions was available, especially in\nJewish synagogue schools. A late rabbinic text refers to 480 synagogues in\nJerusalem alone before the destruction of the Temple in 70 AD, each with a\nprimary school and an advanced school. Although the number may be inflated,\narchaeologist Lee Levine argues that \u201cthe assumption that many children\nlearned in some sort of formal setting at this time should not be construed as\nfar-fetched,\u201d and that while perhaps not under the auspices of the rabbis yet,\nthe schools seem to have been a responsibility of the synagogue\ncommunity.^3333xLee I. Levine, The Ancient Synagogue: The First Thousand Years\n(New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2000), 144.\n\nBut even if the formation offered to some children in the Greco-Roman world\nwas not from a specific religious tradition, it invariably had religious\ncharacteristics: invoking and appropriating external moral authorities,\ninculcating rituals and social practices, instructing with rigorous knowledge,\nupholding heroes for emulation. As Robert Bellah observed, even Plato, \u201cthe\nman who rejected tradition (and can in no way be called a conservative), knew\nthat humans cannot live without tradition. What he created was a new tradition\n(oxymoron though it is), one in which Socrates replaced Achilles, and his own\ndialogues replaced the epic and tragic poets.\u201d^3434xRobert N. Bellah, Religion\nin Human Evolution: From the Paleolithic to the Axial Age (Cambridge, MA:\nHarvard University Press, 2011), 391.\n\n## Improvising Formation\n\nChief among the many lessons we moderns can draw from moral formation in\nantiquity is the necessity of \u201cthickening\u201d both the breadth and depth of\nformation. The ancients knew, and likely could not have imagined otherwise,\nthat formation required depth, drawing in every part of a person: mind, soul,\nand body. They also assumed that the crafting of young lives necessitated\nbreadth, drawing on every institution available: civic, religious, political,\neducational, athletic, aesthetic, domestic.\n\nA few late-modern Stoic authors aim at this depth, as we have seen, offering\nto their adherents daily readings, reflections, and exercises, which could\noffer the kind of odyssey that Plato, Josephus, Augustine, or Gregory may have\nrecognized. So does the rapidly growing classical wing of primary and\nsecondary education in the United States and the United Kingdom, often\nrevering Aristotle\u2019s Nicomachean Ethics for the training of faculty and the\ndevelopment of students. In the absence of reliable etchical codes, medicine,\nlaw, business, and engineering are also experimenting with Aristotle. Salutary\nas such sporadic and one-off initiatives are, any formation efforts\ndisembedded from an authoritative moral source to which one eventually submits\noneself will be relatively weak.\n\nAs Robert Bellah observed in the mid-1980s, \u201cWith the weakening of the\ntraditional forms of life that gave aesthetic and moral meaning to everyday\nliving, Americans have been improvising alternatives more or less\nsuccessfully...but the capacity of such experiences to provide more than a\nmomentary counterweight to pressures of everyday life is minimal.\u201d^3535xRobert\nN. Bellah et al., Habits of the Heart: Individualism and Commitment in\nAmerican Life (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1985), 291\u201392.\nRather than take this as reason to despair or surrender, though, we might take\nit as a challenge\u2014first, to acknowledge the need for the kind of thickness of\ninstitutions and practices that supported moral formation in the antique\nworld, and, second, to dedicate ourselves, in ways however large or small, to\nbuilding institutions and fostering practices that inculcate habits of the\nheart essential to a strong moral character and suitable to our time. That\nspirit of relentless dedication to the inculcation of virtues might be the\nbest lesson we take from the ancient world.\n\nReprinted from The Hedgehog Review 26.1 (Spring 2024).
