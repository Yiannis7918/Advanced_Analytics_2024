The public face of a cute\naccelerationist philosophy addressing increasingly important issues of our\ntime. The exponential development in AI and associated technologies have made\nexistential questions a reasonable topic of discussion that used to seem\ncompletely sci-fi to consider even a few years ago. Questions involving the\nfuture of the human body, the human soul, and life itself.\n\nWhere are we now, and where do we want to go?\n\nFor the first time in a long time, we are no longer in maintenance mode. In\novercoming postmodernity, grand narratives are once again making an\nappearance. The end of history has ended, we need to get back to writing the\nfuture. But what is not yet decided is who will be the author of the book of\nour fates. Polarising camps of techno-optimists and techno-skeptics have\ncontradictory visions for what we should do about the machines, and how we\nshould answer questions of humanity, humanism, and transhumanism overall, and\nit is now time to hash them out, with one side achieving hegemony and\ndominance eventually. What is a human? What is gender? Nature, nurture, or\nmachinery? Is technology a blessing or a curse? Regulation or move fast and\nbreak things? Are we all going to live in the metaverse? Should we? Embracing\ntechnological progress in the way that radical optimists suggest we do could\nbe liberating, but it could also be one of the greatest oppressions in history\nin how fundamentally opposed it is to what some people would consider \u201chuman\nnature\u201d, and to nature as a whole.\n\nOn the other side of #BRG\u2019s hyper-digitised imaginaries of a machine-driven\nfuture, we see a growing resistance to not only AI, but industrialised\ncivilisation itself. The most popular take in this regard is \u201cphones bad\u201d,\nalong with it \u201csocial media and its consequences have been a disaster for the\nhuman race\u201d, along similar lines memes are proclaiming that it is unreasonable\nand downright insane to expect one to write emails and look at screens for 8\nhours a day \u201cwith a brain that\u2019s made to pick berries and chill in the forest\u201d\n- carrying the implication that anything related to modern civilisation is a\nforeign, unnatural imposition that we ought to be resisting. But resistance\nmay be futile - I would assume it to be hard to put the technological cat back\nin the bag, especially with it being in the hands of tech-oligarchs who have\nmore money and power than any of us can dream of. Me, personally, I would like\nto gain control over the technological means of production and interaction,\nand steer it into something that isn\u2019t going to eradicate humanity, something\nthat works for us instead of against us, but that would require heavy\npolitical struggle and potentially even a socialist revolution.\n\nSo on the techno-skeptic side there could be communism with machines working\nfor people, there could be some form of modern-ish primitivism with people\nreturning to small communities exchanging backyard tomatoes, but both of these\nwould require a slow-down of progress as it runs currently, which would mean\nactive intervention and prevention. But there is also a third option, which is\nfull acceleration: Welcome to Remilia.\n\nFull, total, high-speed acceleration, the path of least resistance, as it only\nrequires us to embrace what\u2019s coming and support it unconditionally, maybe\neven put it on steroids - with techno-optimists such as Marc Andreessen\ndefending this by proclaiming that machines and their consequences have been\nan overall force for good in the history of the human race - is what is\nsupported by Remilia, \u201cGod\u2019s little warriors\u201d in the battle for \u201cthe serenity,\nlove and simplicity of CUTE/ACC\u201d.\n\nNow why do I care about the #BRG specifically? Why am I analysing a meme-\nphenomenon created and propagated by self-proclaimed art school dropouts?\n\nI took note of the #BRG for a few reasons. Gen Z is terminally online, and\nAlphas (lol) will be even more so. Cultural phenomena and the societal\nattitudes they foster no longer emerge on theatre stages, or in town squares,\nor on TV. It happens online. Whatever is hip on 4chan bleeds into meatspace,\nthe raiding of the Capitol being a prime example of MAGA-memers going wild in\nthe real world. If the techno-optimists win, the #BRG is not only contributing\nto their success, but laying the groundwork for culture in the hyper-online\nuniverse. Their postings could also be considered to be manufacturing consent\nfor full acceleration to the tens of thousands of people following their\naccounts. It is possible that in seeing #BRG, we are facing the window to our\nfuture. The memes, being the public face of the philosophy, the accessible\ngateway to cute-Landianism, are just the tip of the based iceberg of based\nretardation, however, as I\u2019ve discovered in my research through various\nRemilia rabbit holes.\n\nAn entire blogosphere is busy hashing out the details of cute-Landian\nphilosophy, while art shows and projects serve as a way of sharing religious\nrevelations and futuristic dreams.\n\nPeople have been left \u201chomeless\u201d in a variety of important spheres - politics,\nphilosophy, spirituality - and Remilia has answers to all of it, responding in\nthe easiest of ways, with the lowest of effort - acceptance of all that is and\nis to come. We do not need new-age spirituality rituals, according to Remilia,\nwe are already embedded in a great spiritual network. We do not need politics,\neither, we can simply be cute and accelerate, which should appeal to those of\nus who have given up.\n\nThoughts on questions of potential relevance are being developed today, in a\ntime in which we had assumed that philosophy was dead and there were no\ninteresting fresh theories, and they are being shared under the noses of\npeople who are under the impression that they are simply consuming a meme.\nTurns out memes can be ways of converting people to the religion of techno-\noptimistic futurism. Or maybe they\u2019re just memes. Maybe Milady really is \u201cjust\nkawaii\u201d and nothing else. Either way, Remilia\u2019s existence is worth examining\nfor reasons that should by now not look as random.\n\n##### How should we read the #BRG?\n\nWe cannot understand #BRG without keeping in mind Nick Land, the \u201cgodfather of\nacceleration\u201d, celebrated by Remilia and cute accelerationists everywhere.\n\n> Nick Land's conceptualization of Capitalism:\n>\n> \u201can autonomous, self-reinforcing, feedback loop that accelerates at a\n> greater rate than the subjects it produces as a byproduct, thereby rendering\n> the byproduct - i.e. the human - obsolete.\u201d\n>\n> This is not unlike Deleuze and Guattari's application of Samuel Butler's\n> thesis - that machines use humans as nodes in the reproduction process of\n> machines - in that Capitalism uses humans as nodes in its own growth\n> process. In both cases, the future may do away with the human once it\n> becomes an obsolete form of reproduction.\n\nWhen it comes to the #BRG, we can clearly witness posthuman ambitions in every\npiece of content. The uncanny-valley artificiality of the \u201cfaces\u201d of the\nmovement and the surroundings they are presented in, the incredible online-\nness of it all, the hyper-digitised vibe that unmistakably embraces, even\nencourages the complete blend of human and machine. Accelerationism in its\npurest, and cutest, form.\n\nThe blogpost \u201cBased Retard Gang: HyperProduction and the GC Becoming of New\nCultures\u201d by Quirked Whiteboy especially feels influenced by Nick Land\u2019s\n\u201cMeltdown\u201d in its fragmented and disjointed nature, a post-human sense of\ncommunication that appears somewhat as if a robot-alien-machine had generated\nit all of its own artificial intelligence, frenetic and somewhat hypnotic when\nread out loud, combined with absurdity and randomness reminiscent of Dadaism,\na movement that sought to dismantle conventional thinking and creativity in\norder to provoke thought and reflection on the state of the world and common\nsocial values, which the BRG itself seems to be referring to:\n\nThe BRG, much like Land himself, points to a chaotic disruption of order\nfollowed by a technologically dominated afterlife:\n\n> \u201crun hide panicked throw blood on ur door when we pass\u201d\n>\n> \u201cDeath is not Real and we will SEE U\n>\n> in the Afterlife Online.\u201d\n>\n> \u201cu will not be \ud83e\udd0dthe same\ud83e\udd0d\n>\n> #BRG will not assume any damages whatsoever from the effects of this\n> \ud83d\udc95Attack\ud83d\udc95\u201d\n>\n> \u201cDon't get into a false sense of security.\u201d\n\nThere will be an attack, it will be transformative, and we will meet again on\nthe other side. Up into the cloud we go? What exactly happens to us and our\nmeatbags is not clearly articulated. What we do know for sure is that we will\nnot be boys. And in the world of Remilia, this is essential.\n\nOne defining feature of anything shared by Remilia is that their protagonist,\ntheir ideal type of being, whether fully or only partially human or entirely\nmachine, is unmistakably feminine. We\u2019re all going to live in the Afterlife\nOnline, or as technologically optimised humanoids, and we\u2019re all going to be\nGIRLS. Heavenly ones. With it/its pronouns, because if everyone is girl, there\nis no need for distinction. Pronouns are for humans, anyway. We\u2019re leaving all\nthat outdated stuff behind us.\n\n##### Hyper-Feminine Futurist Warfare\n\nMilady, the protagonist of the #BRG-verse and the alleged revolutionary\nsubject of the future, threatens us with heart emojis and \u201clove attacks\u201d\ninstead of machine guns. There is no intention of causing physical harm,\nalthough there \u201cwill be victims\u201d. Love attacks are a means of getting people\nto comply, to bring them to the side of Landian posthumanists so that we can\nall peacefully live in cyberspace - the \u201cafterlife online\u201d. Jet fuel can\u2019t\nmelt steel beams - but love can. The way I read this, in the greater context\nof love attacks, is that it is unneeded and unpreferable to blow a whole\nbuilding up if one can work with \u201cglass shards in the organs\u201d and \u201clove bombs\u201d\nto achieve the same goal - the reference to the feeling of emotional damage\nalludes to manipulation and attacks on people\u2019s inner world, their feelings,\nwhich is considered the traditionally feminine form of engaging in conflict.\n\nWhy are we all girls? Because BRG, being proudly cute/acc, carries cuteness at\nthe core of its philosophy. Acceleration, in the eyes of Remilia and its\nfollowers, will be cute, it must be. Anything that isn\u2019t cute would slow down\nthe high-speed accelerationist progress train we\u2019re already sitting in, but we\nwill get to this at a later point.\n\nTo further explain the hyperfemininity aspect, let me introduce you to\n\u201cMilady\u201d, the love attack bombing front line fighter in the battle for Landian\naccelerationism.\n\n##### Evolution Favours the Cute\n\n\u201ccuteness is the libidinal excrement of cold, horror; the product of random\nacts of bioviolence\u201d\n\nMilady, existing both as a philosophical concept and as cute bot-generated NFT\navatar images, is the living subject of the future, a stage of evolution we\ncan barely imagine today and should be embracing at all costs, if we want to\nallow ourselves to be infected by the fervour of the #BRG and open ourselves\nto the possibility of the Afterlife Online.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about the power of cuteness. Humans and animals are\nevolutionarily favoured when they\u2019re cute. Babies are cute. The babies of\ninfinitely threatening scary animals are.. also cute while they\u2019re still\nvulnerable. The femininity of Milady is not only an aesthetic appeal, it is a\nrequirement for its dominance.\n\n> \u201cWherever anything is cute, there is surely a trail of bodies not far\n> behind. Perhaps this is part of the misogynistic narratives of the seductive\n> evil woman - Lilith, Medusa, the archetypes of the seductive spider-woman or\n> the witch, etc., - found among all cultures throughout all times.\u201d (x)\n>\n> \u201cThis is because rebellion is not considered a threat from a subject\n> characterized as emotionally unstable, irresponsible, unintelligent, and of\n> value only as a purely material commodity.\u201d (x)\n\nMilady is precisely the revolutionary subject of the future because it appears\nnonthreatening. Where women were able to access power through masculinisation,\na development that people like Quirked Whiteboy characterise as being doomed\nto a depressing life as a masculine worker drone, Milady embraces, even\naccelerates, all feminine traits, since living a hyper-feminine life (passive,\nsweet, loving, bright, happy, unbothered, carefree) is their path of true\nhappiness, while being their path to power at the same time. While femininity\nconventionally implies repression due to the inability to affect change or\nmake decisions or even be a full subject by being subjugated under patriarchy,\nin the eyes of those that would love nothing more than to unconditionally\nsupport what is already on its way, being passive can only mean cute bliss.\nCute/acc gains dominance by increasing the numbers of people embracing hyper-\nfeminine passivity.\n\nGirliness has a lightness, a naive happiness to it, one that the masculine\nauras behind non-cute accelerationism and techno-optimism do not. Masculinity\nrepresents rationality, order, and agency, and cute/acc is explicitly not\nthat. It is a radical embrace of disorder, a radical rejection of all that is\nmasculine. Milady is all about living one\u2019s best life, being cute, not\nworrying or thinking about anything at all. Hyperfemininity implies a passive\nrole that allows the Miladies of the world to do nothing but bask in their\ncuteness and scroll through memes.\n\nThe belief in Network Spirituality constitutes a belief that whatever is\ncoming for us \u2013 in the case of Remilia, the claim is that it will be the\nAfterlife Online \u2013 is coming without anyone needing to make an effort, we are\nconstantly establishing it simply by living how we do, which at this moment in\ntime is a type of lifestyle that makes hyper-capitalist singularity\nunavoidable, given our dependence on screens combined with an increasing\ndoomerism when it comes to a brighter future, which leads us towards\ndepressive hedonia, which fosters exactly the kind of habits that manifest us\nas the perfect future Metaverse drones. If one decides to simply embrace this,\nthere is no need for masculine-coded active participation in political\ndecision-making.\n\n##### (I Long for) Network Spirituality\n\nLooking at the spiritual aspects of Remilia, an artist collective that\ncertainly does not make visual decisions without any intention behind it, I\nfound it notable that there are two types of human representation in the Based\nRetardverse.\n\nOn the one hand, we have the e-Girls that appear in every piece of animated\ncontent. Cute, sparkly, filtered, only existing within our screens, but still\nsomewhat real. They are based on actual people, they run on human bodies,\ndespite their otherworldly aura. We can imagine them being human, and we can\nimagine ourselves being them.\n\nThe ultimate goal, of course, is supposed to be transcending our physical body\ncompletely and become actual Miladies that are unbothered by profanities like\na pebble in a shoe, or hunger, or global warming. The e-Girl wants to \u201ctalk to\nyour manager, then their manager, then their manager, then their manager,\nuntil (she is) facing God himself\u201d. Ambitions far beyond taking over the\neconomic order - they intend to revolutionise our lifeform entirely, or are\nrather convinced that this will effortlessly take place anyway.\n\n> \u201c#BRG is the abstract diagram of \ud83d\udc95heavenly\ud83d\udc95 inhuman becoming.\u201d\n\nIt takes a worldly representative to help people be comfortable with the idea\nof achieving the eternal blend with the cloud, which would lead us to\nstrengthen our techno-optimist values and habits and in turn speed up\nacceleration. Someone we can relate and aspire to, that we are willing to\nlisten to as it teaches us the gospel of Milady. Just like Jesus was sent down\nto Earth in order to help people connect with God, the e-Girl is sent down to\nEarth from the Cloudverse to help people connect with the idea of a posthuman\nfuture through memes.\n\nOne could interpret it as there being some kind of phase model in place, even\n- a two-step process in our transition from regular normies to Miladies.\n\n> \u201cHer spirit, as manifestation of a singularity and focal point instantiation\n> of the egregore, the Milady spirit, reminiscent of a tribal God, a early\n> Yahweh.\u201d (x)\n\nWhere Milady is God, the e-girl is Jesus: people should aspire to live as\nJesus does, so that at the end of life (referring to the lifecycle of our\nphysical bodies - the \u201cphasing out\u201d of the current product we inhabit) we can,\nand will allow ourselves to, be embraced by, and melt into, God \u2013 Milady.\nWhile most religions do not allow regular human followers to become God at any\npoint in time, this is different for Milady - as Remilia and its followers\n\u201clong for network spirituality\u201d. Network meaning God exists within, through,\nand by all of us, if we let it. It is a shared consciousness, a self-\nreinforcing feedback loop.\n\n> \u201cNetwork spirituality and schizo-autist posting primary goal is to destroy\n> the normie within which will open the pathways for the nu-gods of the\n> network to possess you, its a revival of tradition.. the gods are with you\n> in this holy jihad.\u201d (x)\n\nOr in less spiritually-tinted words: Milady is hyperstitious as a phenomenon\nthat manifests itself through people thinking and acting in accordance with\nits existence.\n\n> \u201cRemilia didn\u2019t invent network spirituality & it\u2019s descriptive not\n> prescriptive. Transcendental posting, performative identity & post-\n> authorship are a distinct archetype of engagement you\u2019ll find power users\n> independently arrive on in any of the deep wells of internet culture. The\n> reason its hard to concretely define terms like schizo-autist posting and\n> network spirituality is because they were grown from the soil of the Wired,\n> the only thing Remilia did was water the soil. The best definition is\n> whatever vibes contextually.\u201d (x)\n\nInstead of a movement fighting to make real change, cute accelerationism is\nthe ultimate form of non-resistance, seeing as the technological takeover of\nall that exists is the most likely outcome of things continuing as they are.\n\n\u201cWe do not even need a theory of acceleration anymore. The time of theories is\nover. The time of thinking is over. It\u2019s time to stop thinking. It\u2019s time to\nstart affirming, literally right now, and forever and ever from now on.\n\nMilady exemplifies the serenity, love and simplicity of CUTE/ACC. The truth of\nwhat is yet to come is palpable in Milady\u2019s gaze alone, sheltered in twinkling\nirises like a prophecy.\u201d - cute/acc manifesto\n\nSo maybe this is Milady\u2019s world already, and we\u2019re just living in it.\n\nOr maybe there\u2019s still something to be done.\n\n\u2014\n\n(Reading list to be added later, for those who want to get into the strange\nInternet rabbit holes I ended up finding myself in)\n\nThanks for indulging me in exploring Remilia hingelessness!\n\n3 Likes\n\n3\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Let's talk about Milady, Cute Accelerationism, and Network Spirituality\n\nmichellefederico.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nThe Internet Has Turned Us Into the ChatGPT of \"Takes\"\n\nLet's talk about the human machine learning of political discussion points and\nthe damage this does to the Left today.\n\nFeb 5, 2023 \u2022\n\nMichelle Federico\n\n11\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Internet Has Turned Us Into the ChatGPT of \"Takes\"\n\nmichellefederico.substack.com\n\n2\n\nBeing \"baby\" is not anti-capitalist\n\nPolitical movements require responsible agents who can handle tough\nchallenges.\n\nAug 13, 2023 \u2022\n\nMichelle Federico\n\n8\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Being \"baby\" is not anti-capitalist\n\nmichellefederico.substack.com\n\n2\n\nMark Fisher was right: The desire for Starbucks really is the thwarted desire\nfor communism\n\nLet's talk about my two cents on the loneliness problem - it's related to the\ndecline of third places, which capitalism is largely responsible for.\n\nOct 21, 2023 \u2022\n\nMichelle Federico\n\n4\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Mark Fisher was right: The desire for Starbucks really is the thwarted\ndesire for communism\n\nmichellefederico.substack.com\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Michelle Federico\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
