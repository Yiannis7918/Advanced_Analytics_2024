Some of those were already sold in transit, but overall, the\nautomaker added over 100,000 vehicles to its inventory.\n\nTesla, like most other automakers, needs cheaper vehicles in order to counter\nthe high-interest rates.\n\nNow, the automaker has introduced a new trim of its popular Model Y to offer\nanother cheaper option:\n\n> Introducing Model Y LR RWD\n>\n> Maximum range that allows you to commute all week without charging\u2014at an\n> even more accessible price\n>\n> Specs below \u2013 600 km (WLTP) when equipped with 19\" Gemini Wheels \u2013 217 km/h\n> top speed \u2013 Lowest cost per kilometer in the electric SUV market (14.9...\n> pic.twitter.com/1jlZuU9Yxi\n>\n> \u2014 Tesla Europe & Middle East (@teslaeurope) April 11, 2024\n\nThe new Model Y Long Range Rear-Wheel-Drive is now the new second cheapest\nModel Y, starting at \u20ac48,990 \u2013 \u20ac4,000 more than the standard range rear-wheel-\ndrive:\n\nIt comes with the longest range of the Model Y lineup with 600 km (373 miles)\non the WLTP standard when equipped with 19\u2032\u2032 Gemini wheels.\n\nTesla claims the \u201clowest cost per kilometer in the electric SUV market (14.9\nkWh/100 km).\u201d\n\nThe new version is available in most, but not all of Tesla\u2019s European markets:\n\n  * Austria\n  * Czechia\n  * Denmark\n  * Finland\n  * Germany\n  * Belgium\n  * Luxembourg\n  * Switzerland\n  * Spain\n  * Portugal\n  * Norway,\n  * Sweden\n  * Iceland\n  * Italy\n  * Greece\n  * Poland\n  * Slovenia\n  * Romania\n  * Hungary\n\n## Electrek\u2019s Take\n\n## Top comment by betterFuture\n\nLiked by 10 people\n\nThat's the model I'd buy here in the US. I don't need AWD and that saves\nweight and improves range. I hope Tesla will add this configuration when the\nupdated model Y shows up in the US.\n\nView all comments\n\nI love more powertrain options. There are plenty of people who don\u2019t recall\nneed all-wheel-drive, but they would need or prefer longer range.\n\nThis is a no-brainer and should be available in all markets in my opinion.\n\nWhat do you think?
