Yet a new crop of non-bank\nfintech [financial technology] startups, known as neobanks, are combating\nthese stereotypes in the form of digital-first\u2014often, digital only\u2014banking\nplatforms that promise seamless online experiences and low- or no-fee\nservices.\n\nBut is the neobank experience all it\u2019s cracked up to be for customers? Here\u2019s\na rundown of some of today\u2019s most popular neobanks, how their business models\noperate and what you may want to consider before making the switch.\n\n## What Is a Neobank?\n\nNeobanks, sometimes referred to as \u201cchallenger banks,\u201d are fintech firms that\noffer apps, software and other technologies to streamline mobile and online\nbanking. These fintechs generally specialize in particular financial products,\nlike checking and savings accounts. They also tend to be more nimble and\ntransparent than their megabank counterparts, even though many of them partner\nwith such institutions to insure their financial products.\n\nIn the U.S., these fintechs are more commonly referred to as neobanks. The\nterm \u201cchallenger bank\u201d was first popularized in the U.K. to refer to a number\nof fintech banking startups that emerged in the wake of the 2007-2009\nfinancial crisis.\n\nThe \u201cchallenger\u201d moniker is apt. These companies are often compared to digital\ndisruptors in other industries. Today, these fintechs are transforming the\nbanking sector in a similar way as Airbnb revolutionized the hospitality\nindustry or Uber and Lyft overhauled transportation. In the U.S., some big-\nname neobanks are attracting customers in droves. For example, in February\n2021, it was estimated that Chime had 12 million customers, up from eight\nmillion one year prior.\n\nIn December 2020, research by Exton Consulting, a strategy and management\nconsulting firm for the financial services sector based in Paris, France,\nfound there were 256 neobanks worldwide.\n\n## Popular Neobanks\n\nThere\u2019s an overwhelming number of neobanks on the market. Forbes Advisor\nrecently published a breakdown of some of the most popular online banks, as\nwell as their pros and cons. The list includes a mixed bag of neobanks and\n\u201chybrid\u201d platforms that offer similar digital services but are tied to legacy\ninstitutions.\n\nHere are some of the better-known neobanks on the market today.\n\n### Chime\n\nBoasting more than 12 million users, Chime is arguably the most widely\nrecognized brand in the neobank space in the U.S. The platform eliminates many\nof the common fees typically associated with brick-and-mortar banks. Chime\nalso provides credit-building opportunities, early access to direct deposit\npayments and automatic savings features with a competitive annual percentage\nyield (APY). Chime is a financial technology company, not a bank. Banking\nservices and debit cards are issued by The Bancorp Bank or Stride Bank, N.A.;\nMembers FDIC.\n\n### Varo Bank\n\nVaro Bank was founded as a neobank. But the company, which has around 2\nmillion users, received a full-service national banking charter in 2020 from\nthe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), officially making it a\nbank. The service offers similar perks to Chime, including no monthly or\noverdraft fees and no minimum balance requirement. Users don\u2019t need to undergo\na credit check to open an account.\n\n### Current\n\nCurrent is another neobank that has attracted hundreds of thousands of users\nin the U.S. It offers benefits such as early access to direct deposit, fee-\nfree overdrafts and cash back on debit card purchases.\n\n### International Challenger Banks\n\nIn the U.K., popular challenger banks include Revolut (which recently made its\nU.S. debut), Starling and Metro Bank. Other international challengers include\nN26 in Germany and NuBank in Brazil.\n\n## Neobanks vs. Online Banks\n\nNeobanks are largely online-only banking platforms that lack branches, but\nthey shouldn\u2019t be confused with online banks. Generally speaking, online banks\nhave a bank charter and provide a broader range of services to their\ncustomers, including loans. Ally Bank, for example, is considered an online\nbank.\n\nIn response to the popularity of neobank platforms, established players have\nunveiled or improved their own products or divisions to compete with the\nnascent neobank industry. Capital One 360, for instance, is a no-fee checking\naccount with similar advantages like no minimum balance requirements. There\u2019s\nalso Marcus by Goldman Sachs and Discover Bank from Discover Financial\nServices, among a slew of others.\n\n## How Do Neobanks Make Money?\n\nNeobanks typically use a different business model than incumbent banking\ninstitutions. They make a good chunk of their revenue from interchange\u2014fees\npaid by merchants when customers make purchases using their debit card. As\nsmaller organizations, neobanks are allowed interchange percentages up to\nseven times higher than those available to banks with more than $10 billion in\nassets.\n\nThere\u2019s also some debate about how much money challenger banks make from\ncustomers using out-of-network ATMs. When examining Chime\u2019s source of income\nin a recent article, Axios suggested this amount may be \u201csignificant\u201d\u2014upwards\nof 20%. In response to the report, Chime said this source of income only\nconstitutes a \u201csmall percentage\u201d of overall company revenue, and reiterated\nthat they offer 38,000 fee-free ATMs nationwide.\n\nVenture capitalists have been pouring funds into neobanks over the past\ndecade, too. In 2020, Chime secured $485 million in Series F funding, causing\nits valuation to balloon to $14.5 billion. Earlier this year, Varo raised $63\nmillion, bringing its total funding to more than $482 million in less than\nfour years since its launch.\n\nBut not all challenger banks are success stories, and some skeptics question\nthose sky-high valuations. The pandemic and its impact on consumer spending\ndealt a heavy blow to some early European darlings like Monzo. Australian\nneobank Xinja folded last year, citing the Covid-19 crisis and resulting\ndifficulties in raising capital.\n\nIn the U.S., BBVA recently announced that two of its challenger bank\nacquisitions were shuttering: Simple, which launched in 2009, and Azlo, a fee-\nfree bank for small businesses. Speculation is that PNC Bank, which is in the\nmidst of acquiring BBVA USA, hopes to bring Simple and Azlo customers back to\nits own core offerings. The \u201cstrategic decision\u201d exemplifies the tenuous\nnature of some neobanks\u2019 trajectory for long-term growth.\n\n## Should You Consider Switching to a Neobank?\n\nFor the growing number of customers demanding digital financial services, it\u2019s\neasy to see the appeal of neobanks. Conducting everyday tasks like depositing\nchecks or making peer-to-peer payments online\u2014and without a flurry of fees\u2014is\nconvenient. The agile nature of neobanks, which generally have fewer\nregulatory hurdles to clear, also often means easier account set-up and faster\nprocessing times.\n\nYet, neobanks aren\u2019t for everyone. They tend to have pared-down services\ncompared to incumbent financial institutions. They typically extend no or\nlimited credit to their customers. They focus more on basics like checking and\nsavings accounts than, for instance, providing mortgages or other loans. They\nalso rarely build brick-and-mortar branches, so users aren\u2019t likely to have\naccess to in-person assistance with accounts.\n\nCustomers considering making the leap from a legacy bank to a digital-first\none will want to consider factors including:\n\n  * The financial products on offer\u2014e.g., checking accounts, money transfer platforms, etc.\u2014and how they meet your needs\n  * ATM prevalence and accessibility\n  * Any fees or \u201cfine print\u201d charges that do exist, particularly for overdrafts\n  * The rates available for interest-bearing accounts\n  * Financial education or budgeting features that come with the platform\n\nProspective neobank customers should also assess their comfort level using\ntechnology platforms. Are you willing to download another app and give it\naccess to your financial data? Are you comfortable discussing banking needs\nwith a chatbot? Is online-only customer service appealing, or do you prefer\nin-person support?\n\nAnd with some hand-wringing about the current state of the European neobank\nmarket, there\u2019s another important consideration\u2014what happens if a neobank goes\nbust? When Simple announced it was shutting down in January 2021, it assured\nusers that their accounts would remain accessible for a few months, and\neventually transfer over to BBVA, Simple\u2019s parent company. But what about\nstand-alone neobanks that aren\u2019t associated with large institutions?\n\nThis last point is why it\u2019s particularly important to make sure that any\nneobank with which you open an account is federally insured. Check that the\nneobank you\u2019re considering is recognized by the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (FDIC), or for international residents, protected by the Financial\nServices Compensation Scheme (FSCS) or similar regulatory bodies. This ensures\na degree of security for cash you deposit into mobile apps or online accounts.\n\n## Pros and Cons of Neobanks\n\nLike all financial institutions, neobanks have their share of pros and cons.\n\n### Pros\n\n  * Lower fees. Like online banks, neobanks don\u2019t have the costs associated with maintaining branches. Some platforms pass those savings to their customers in the form of lower fees.\n  * Higher rates. Because of lower overhead costs, neobanks tend to offer higher interest rates to their customers.\n  * Convenience. You can conduct everyday tasks, like depositing checks or making peer-to-peer payments, via mobile or online banking from anywhere at any time.\n\n### Cons\n\n  * No bank charter. Neobanks are not banks and do not have a bank charter. Instead, these institutions generally partner with a bank to insure their products. Before signing up with a neobank, make sure it\u2019s FDIC insured by a partner bank.\n  * Rarely, if ever, offer brick-and-mortar branches. Neobanks generally don\u2019t maintain a physical branch presence. You aren\u2019t likely to have access to in-person assistance.\n  * Fewer services than traditional banks. Neobanks generally have pared-down services, compared to traditional or online banks. These institutions tend to focus on checking and savings more than loans.\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nNeobanks emerged in response to a new, digital era\u2014and to the pain points\nrelated to the financial services market of yesteryear. Despite some bumps in\nthe road, the trend is not likely to dissipate anytime soon. And, in an\nindustry that has long needed diversification and a renewed focus on\naccessibility, that\u2019s a good thing.\n\nSponsored\n\nAdvertiser Disclosure\n\nAdvertiser Disclosure\n\nCompare Personal Finance Options for 2021\n\nSelect all products of interest and compare:\n\nProduct Descriptions\n\nProduct Descriptions\n\nChecking\n\nA transactional account that allows for numerous withdrawals and unlimited\ndeposits.
