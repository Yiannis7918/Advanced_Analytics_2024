The central\nconflict is that while many doctors have reported success in using ivermectin,\nsome studies published in major journals suggest it is in fact ineffective.\n\nEven as the FDA recently has been removing misinformation it posted about\nivermectin, the agency has maintained its original position regarding its\neffectiveness, namely that there isn\u2019t evidence.\n\nPeople who trust ivermectin claim the studies showing ineffectiveness are\nfraudulent, while people who are skeptical of its use for treating COVID-19\nview it as an anti-science conspiracy theory.\n\nAs a professional with decades of research experience conducting dozens of\nclinical trials on antiviral drugs, I decided to dive deep into the studies\npurporting ivermectin\u2019s ineffectiveness. What I found shocked me.\n\n## Legacy Media Report Ineffectiveness\n\nNumerous preclinical studies have found that ivermectin has a broad range of\neffects on COVID-19, spanning from its initial impact on viral infection to\nthe pathological changes the virus causes in our bodies.\n\nIvermectin inhibits the entire life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 in our cells from\nattachment, spreading, and replication (1, 2, 3).\n\nMoreover, ivermectin is anti-inflammatory and organ-protective, which can\npotentially protect against severe COVID-related lung damage and acute\nrespiratory distress syndrome, heart-related complications, and blood clots.\n\nIvermectin exceeds the approved antiviral effects of other medications,\nincluding Paxlovid, molnupiravir and remdesivir, which only target the virus\nand lack anti-inflammatory and organ-protective effects. Monoclonal antibodies\nhave to be constructed specific to each variant and are very expensive.\n\nIn the pharmaceutical industry, clinical trials are commonly used to evaluate\nthe efficacy and safety of drugs once their mechanism is demonstrated. There\nare two types of clinical trials: observational and interventional.\n\nObservational studies are often conducted by doctors in clinical, hospital, or\ncommunity settings to analyze the effects of drugs. The data is collected as\nobserved in clinical practice with minimal interference.\n\nMany doctors have observed the positive effects of ivermectin on their\npatients. An observational study conducted in Brazil with over 88,000 patients\nshowed that ivermectin reduced the rates of infection, mortality, and\nhospitalization by 49 percent, 92 percent, and 100 percent, respectively,\ncompared to nonusers.\n\nPharmaceutical companies are required to conduct interventional studies that\nmeet the approval standards set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\n(FDA). Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are frequently utilized to fulfill\nthese requirements. This type of study is considered the gold standard and\ninvolves randomly assigning one group of patients to receive a specific drug\nwhile the other group does not receive it, then comparing the outcomes.\n\nLegally and medically, ivermectin can be prescribed off-label to treat\nCOVID-19 since it has already been approved by the FDA for other diseases.\n\nAlthough many doctors have observed the positive effects of ivermectin in\ntreating their patients, the media has specifically highlighted data from a\nfew selected RCTs that have concluded it is ineffective in treating COVID-19.\n\nHowever, some critical aspects were overlooked in those RCTs.\n\n## Improper Dosing\n\nA drug\u2019s therapeutic effects can only be observed when it reaches the\nappropriate concentration in the body and remains there for a few days,\nallowing sufficient time to work.\n\nImproper dosing was a major issue in the RCTs that found ivermectin\nineffective.\n\n### Recommended Dosage\n\nAccording to Merck\u2019s package insert for ivermectin (brand name Stromectol), a\nsingle oral dose of 0.2 mg/kg was officially recommended for treating\nparasitic diseases. There is no official dose for COVID-19.\n\nThe recommended dosage of ivermectin for treating COVID-19 is based on the\nclinical experiences of physicians worldwide.\n\nThe Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance (FLCCC) guidelines recommend\ntaking 0.4 mg/kg of ivermectin daily, immediately after exposure. Once a\ncumulative dose in excess of 200 mg is reached, the risk of acquiring COVID-19\nhas been shown to be nearly zero.\n\nIt is common for a drug with multiple indications to have different doses for\ndifferent diseases.\n\nMoreover, ivermectin should be given with food, as it has a 2.6-fold higher\nbioavailability when taken with food rather than on an empty stomach. The\nMerck package insert (revised May 2022) also supports this and states:\n\u201cAdministration of 30 mg ivermectin following a high-fat meal resulted in an\napproximate 2.5-fold increase in bioavailability relative to administration of\n30 mg ivermectin in the fasted state.\u201d\n\nFLCCC guidelines also recommend taking ivermectin \u201cwith or just following a\nmeal for greater absorption.\u201d\n\nYet this important dosing information is not reflected in the commonly used\ndrug prescribing resource known as the Prescribers\u2019 Digital Reference or PDR\nwhich states: \u201cTake the number of tablets your doctor has prescribed all at\nthe same time with water on an empty stomach. Do not eat any food within two\nhours before or after taking the tablets.\u201d\n\nSo if a person takes the dose while fasting, they are getting only 40 percent\nof the recommended dose. For patients with a higher body weight, the effects\nof underdosing could be even more significant.\n\n### RCT Studies Used Inappropriate Dosing\n\nIn the most recent PRINCIPLE trial published in March, ivermectin was used at\n0.3 mg/kg for only three days. Moreover, it was designed to dose the\nivermectin without food: \u201cParticipants were advised not to eat two hours\nbefore or after taking ivermectin.\u201d\n\nIn another RCT ACTIV-6 published in JAMA in October 2022, ivermectin was dosed\nin a fasting status, as the protocol stated: \u201cIvermectin should be taken on an\nempty stomach with water (30 minutes before a meal or 2 hours after a meal).\u201d\n\nIvermectin was reported as dosed at 0.4 mg/kg for three days\u2014a much shorter\ntime period than it should be. However, in the protocol Table 4 in Appendix\n16.3.3, the precise dosing was as low as 0.269 mg/kg, and 0.4 mg/kg is\nactually only the upper dose limit\u2014not the real dose.\n\nAccording to the worldwide recognized study guideline ICH Good Clinical\nPractice, clinical trials must adhere to ethical principles. Failure to do so\nwould be considered study misconduct or fraud and would violate the principle\nof integrity.\n\nAnother JAMA study published in March 2021 repeated the same mistake in mild\nCOVID-19 patients by suggesting they take 0.3 mg/kg for five days on an empty\nstomach.\n\nAn RCT study known as TOGETHER, published in March 2022 in the New England\nJournal of Medicine, underdosed ivermectin with 0.4 mg/kg for only three days\nand did not mention dosing with food.\n\nNevertheless, even at this low dose, the ivermectin still reduced\nhospitalization rates, death, and the need for mechanical ventilation compared\nto a placebo.\n\n## Clinical Improvement Despite Underdosing\n\nIt is inappropriate to conclude that ivermectin was ineffective based on these\nRCT studies with major design flaws.\n\nDespite the poor study design, ivermectin showed clinical benefits and saved\nlives.\n\nIn the PRINCIPLE study, self-reported recovery was shorter in the ivermectin\ngroup than usual care, with a median decrease of 2.06 days. The statistical\nanalysis showed that it met the predefined superiority criteria.\n\nFurthermore, the analysis showed that ivermectin effectively reduced\nCOVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths. Only 1.6 percent of 2,157\npatients in the ivermectin group experienced hospitalizations or deaths,\ncompared to 4.4 percent of 3,256 patients in the usual care group.\n\nEven a low dose of ivermectin has demonstrated the potential to save lives.\nHowever, the authors concluded, \u201cIvermectin for COVID-19 is unlikely to\nprovide clinically meaningful improvement in recovery, hospital admissions, or\nlonger-term outcomes.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the report\u2019s appendix includes dozens of recorded clinical benefits\nin patients treated with ivermectin, such as the time it took to alleviate all\nsymptoms, general unwellness, muscle aches, and headaches. The improvement of\nsymptoms was also sustained, and the severity was reduced. Surprisingly, the\nsource PDF was removed from the website during the writing of this article.\n\nThere are additional examples. Although the previously mentioned 2021 JAMA\nstudy underdosed patients, treatment with ivermectin reduced recovery time by\ntwo days. In the ACTIV-6 study, only one venous blood clot event was reported\nin 817 ivermectin-treated patients, compared to five events in 774 placebo-\ntreated patients.\n\n## Statistical Failures\n\nIt is important to note that the definition of treatment effects in an RCT can\ndiffer from those discussed in real-life observational studies.\n\nSometimes, even if the results of a clinical trial demonstrate a clear effect,\nthe conclusion may still be interpreted as ineffective due to the statistical\ndefinition of effectiveness.\n\nInterpreting statistics can be challenging as they usually involve complicated\nmathematical models and numerical data that can be manipulated to support a\nspecific agenda. Nevertheless, for the purpose of this discussion, let\u2019s\npresume that all research is carried out conscientiously and without\nmanipulative intent.\n\nIn a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with mild to\nmoderate COVID-19 patients, none of the 55 patients in the ivermectin group\ndied, whereas four of 57 in the placebo group died. This resulted in a\ncomparison of zero percent versus 7 percent. Moreover, only 1.8 percent of\nivermectin-treated patients needed invasive ventilation compared to 8.8\npercent in the placebo group.\n\nIn other words, ivermectin reduced the risk of death by 100 percent and the\nneed for ventilators by 80 percent.\n\nHowever, the article did not provide the p-value (probability value) for the\ndeath rate comparison or the invasive ventilation of 0.102 (Table 2), which is\nhigher than the 0.05 threshold considered to be a significant statistical\ndifference.\n\nP-values are commonly used to test and measure a \u201cnull hypothesis,\u201d which\nstates that no differences exist in the effects being studied between two\ngroups. A finding is considered statistically significant and warrants\npublication when the p-value is 0.05 or less.\n\nThe p-values in this study were deemed insignificant because they were more\nthan 0.05. Accordingly, the authors wrote that this difference was\nstatistically insignificant and concluded that ivermectin \u201chad shown only\nmarginal benefit.\u201d\n\nHow could a 100 percent reduction in death or an 80 percent reduction in\nventilation be interpreted as \u201cmarginal\u201d effects?\n\nIn the I-TECH study published in JAMA Internal Medicine in 2022, the patients\ntreated with ivermectin had a lower mortality rate of 1.2 percent compared to\n4 percent in the comparator group.\n\nThe same conclusion was made as the previous study because the p-value was\n0.09 and higher than 0.05.\n\nIf the 7 million patients reported to have died from COVID-19 had been treated\nwith ivermectin, an estimated 4.9 million lives could potentially have been\nsaved based on the 70 percent reduced mortality rate from the I-TECH study; or\n4.5 million lives could have been saved based on the 64 percent reduction of\nmortality in the PRINCIPLE study.\n\nThe life-saving potential of ivermectin has been hindered by the unnecessary\nstatistical threshold. The problem of statistical significance is widespread\nand frequently causes confusion among scientists.\n\nA 2016 Nature article raised concerns about the misuse of p-values. A 2019\ncomment in the same journal stated that \u201cThe misuse of statistical\nsignificance has done much harm to the scientific community and those who rely\non scientific advice.\u201d\n\nThe authors called for abandoning the use of statistical significance to draw\nconclusions regarding the effectiveness of drugs, such as stating that \u201cdrug Y\ndoes not work,\u201d and cautioned that such conclusions may result in the\ndismissal of potentially life-saving drugs.\n\nThe authors also wrote: \u201cLet\u2019s be clear about what must stop; we should never\nconclude there is \u2018no difference\u2019 or \u2018no association\u2019 just because a P value\nis larger than a threshold such as 0.o5.\u201d\n\n## Selection Bias\n\nMany people, including physicians, may not be aware that interventional\nstudies, particularly RCTs, are are prone to numerous biases, with selection\nbias being one of the most significant. Excluding potentially eligible\nindividuals due to their anticipated group allocation can lead to selection\nbias.\n\nIt\u2019s common knowledge that early treatment of COVID-19 is crucial for\neffective results. The earlier the treatment starts, the more effective it is.\nThese approved antivirals for COVID-19 are used shortly after COVID-19\ninfection and usually within a few days after symptom onset.\n\nFor example, Paxlovid and molnupiravir registration trials treated patients\nwithin only three to five days of symptom onset.\n\nHowever, in the PRINCIPLE trial, ivermectin was used for patients within 14\ndays of symptom onset, while ACTIV-6 treated patients an average of six days\nafter infection.\n\nPatients with severe kidney disease are normally excluded from phase 3\nstudies, as they are less likely to respond to antiviral treatment. This\napproach has been taken by remdesivir (protocol), molnupiravir (protocol), and\nPaxlovid (protocol). However, such standard exclusion criteria were not taken\nby the ACTIV-6 or PRINCIPLE study protocols.\n\nWhy was ivermectin treated so unfairly in these clinical trials?\n\nIt is well known that when an RCT is sponsored by Big Pharma, there is often a\nfinancial conflict of interest, as the research institutions are usually hired\nor funded by the pharmaceutical company. In a world where wealth often\ncompetes with ethics, how many can resist financial temptation and stay true\nto moral principles?\n\n\u201cHidden agenda bias\u201d occurs when a trial is conducted to demonstrate a desired\noutcome, rather than to answer a question. In other words, \u201cDon\u2019t do a trial\nif it won\u2019t show you what you want to find.\u201d\n\n## Proven Without a Profit Motive\n\nConducting an RCT to get a drug approved by the FDA requires money. Every drug\nmust be managed by a professional team composed of doctors, database managers,\nand assistants. Professionals must secure funding, recruit a lead\ninvestigator, and find hospitals to conduct the study. An operational team\nmust perform the study, analyze the data, and gain FDA approval.\n\nSince ivermectin is a generic drug that lacks profitable marketing and a\npharmaceutical sponsor, it\u2019s challenging to organize and systematically manage\nits new application with health authorities, data, and customers.\n\nNevertheless, doctors worldwide have been using ivermectin to help patients\nand have collected valuable data.\n\nThe website c19ivm.org has compiled data on 102 clinical trials proving\nivermectin\u2019s consistent effectiveness in treating COVID-19. Studies with\nnegative conclusions about ivermectin are also included, such as the the four\nRCTs with recognized design flaws.\n\nSince the beginning of the analysis, ivermectin has consistently shown\nefficacy. This meta-analysis provides a thorough and transparent real-time\nanalysis of all eligible ivermectin studies.\n\nThe trials were conducted by 1,139 doctors or scientists from 29 countries\nwith 142,307 patients. Out of the total studies, 86 have been peer-reviewed\nwith 128,787 patients, and 49 were randomized controlled trials with 16,847\npatients.\n\nIn the studies with comparative groups, ivermectin was shown to reduce the\nrisk of COVID-19 infection by 81 percent, mortality by 49 percent, ICU\nadmission by 35 percent, ventilation usage by 29 percent, and hospitalization\nby 34 percent.\n\nIn comparison to the control groups, the use of ivermectin as a preventive\nmeasure before infection reduced the most severe clinical outcomes of COVID-19\nby 85 percent. When used in the early stage of COVID-19, ivermectin decreased\nthe severity of the disease by 62 percent, and when used in late stages, it\nreduced the clinical severity by 39 percent. Clinical severity is measured by\ndeath, ventilation, disease progression, or hospitalization.\n\n## Considering the Entire Picture\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to believe that the designers of these studies were unaware of\nthe dosing of ivermectin. Despite all of the above analyses, the reasoning\nbehind the ivermectin underdosing or unfavorable study design may be linked to\nfactors beyond science.\n\nA new drug or vaccine cannot achieve an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)\nstatus if there is an existing viable therapeutic available. This fact alone\nmay have impacted many decisions.\n\nThe NIH website lists only those RCTs that I found to have design flaws (or\npotential fraud) to justify its recommendation against the use of ivermectin\nin the treatment of COVID-19.\n\nPeer-reviewed studies showing the efficacy of ivermectin in treating COVID-19\nhave been retracted without explanation, and doctors have been demonized,\ncensored, and doxxed for speaking the truth.\n\nLegacy media, including The New York Times and CNN, reported incomplete and\nimproperly interpreted trials that failed to present an accurate\nrepresentation of ivermectin\u2019s effects.\n\nIt\u2019s important to keep an open mind and consider the entire picture when\nexamining the ivermectin issue, rather than dismissing it as conspiracy or\nmisinformation. This can lead to more informed decisions that could ultimately\nsave lives.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the opinions of the author and do not\nnecessarily reflect the views of The Epoch Times or ZeroHedge.\n\n0\n\nLoading...\n\n### Today's Top Stories\n\nContact Information+\n\nAssistance and Requests: Click here\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Click here\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nSuggested Reading+\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\nInterest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy\non conflicts / full disclosure.Here's our Cookie Policy.\n\nHow to report offensive comments\n\nNotice on Racial Discrimination.\n\n  * Discrimination Notice\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Disclosure\n  * Disclaimer\n  * Advertise with ZeroHedge\n\nCopyright \u00a92009-2024 ZeroHedge.com/ABC Media, LTD\n\n", "frontpage": false}
