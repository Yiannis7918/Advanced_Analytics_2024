Oxford University Physics.\n\nThe full power of next-generation quantum computing could soon be harnessed by\nmillions of individuals and companies, thanks to a breakthrough by scientists\nat Oxford University Physics guaranteeing security and privacy. This advance\npromises to unlock the transformative potential of cloud-based quantum\ncomputing and is detailed in a new study published in Physical Review Letters.\nThe paper is titled \"Verifiable blind quantum computing with trapped ions and\nsingle photons.\"\n\nQuantum computing is developing rapidly, paving the way for new applications\nthat could transform services in many areas like health care and financial\nservices. It works in a fundamentally different way than conventional\ncomputing and is potentially far more powerful. However, it currently requires\ncontrolled conditions to remain stable and there are concerns around data\nauthenticity and the effectiveness of current security and encryption systems.\n\nSeveral leading providers of cloud-based services, like Google, Amazon, and\nIBM, already separately offer some elements of quantum computing. Safeguarding\nthe privacy and security of customer data is a vital precursor to scaling up\nand expanding its use, and for the development of new applications as the\ntechnology advances. The new study by researchers at Oxford University Physics\naddresses these challenges.\n\n\"We have shown for the first time that quantum computing in the cloud can be\naccessed in a scalable, practical way which will also give people complete\nsecurity and privacy of data, plus the ability to verify its authenticity,\"\nsaid Professor David Lucas, who co-heads the Oxford University Physics\nresearch team and is lead scientist at the UK Quantum Computing and Simulation\nHub, led from Oxford University Physics.\n\nExperiments on quantum computing in the Beecroft facility, Oxford University\nPhysics.

Importantly, their new methods could be\nscaled up to large quantum computations.\n\n\"Using blind quantum computing, clients can access remote quantum computers to\nprocess confidential data with secret algorithms and even verify the results\nare correct, without revealing any useful information. Realizing this concept\nis a big step forward in both quantum computing and keeping our information\nsafe online,\" said study lead Dr. Peter Drmota, of Oxford University Physics.\n\nThe researchers created a system comprising a fiber network link between a\nquantum computing server and a simple device detecting photons, or particles\nof light, at an independent computer remotely accessing its cloud services.\nThis allows so-called blind quantum computing over a network.\n\nEvery computation incurs a correction that must be applied to all that follow\nand needs real-time information to comply with the algorithm. The researchers\nused a unique combination of quantum memory and photons to achieve this.\n\nPeter Drmota, author of the new study who led the experiments on blind quantum\ncomputing at Oxford University Physics.
