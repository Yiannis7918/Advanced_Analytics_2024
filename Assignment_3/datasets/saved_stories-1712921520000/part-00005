7 years ago (2017-04-03),\nwith the Dynamics of the Orkney Passage Outflow (DynOPO)^[6]^[22] expedition\nonboard research ship RRS James Clark Ross of the British Antarctic Survey\n(BAS), to research how Antarctic Bottom Water leaves the Weddell Sea and\nenters the Southern Ocean through a 3.5 kilometres (11,000 feet) deep region\nknown as the Orkney Passage,^[7] south of Chile.^[5]^[23]^[24]^[25] During\nthis DynOPO expedition, which was part of a primary project with the\nUniversity of Southampton, the National Oceanography Centre (NOC), and the\nBritish Antarctic Survey (BAS), along with additional support from the Woods\nHole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) and Princeton University, she traveled\n112 miles (180 kilometres) at depths of up to 4,000 metres (13,000 feet), and\ncollected data on water temperature, salinity, and turbulence. Combined with\nmeasurements collected by RRS James Clark Ross, the data suggest that as winds\nover the Southern Ocean have strengthened, driven by the hole in the ozone\nlayer above Antarctica, and increases in greenhouse gases, they have increased\nthe turbulence of deep ocean waters, leading to increased mixing of cold and\nwarm water.^[26] According to National Oceanography Centre oceanographer Dr\nEleanor Frajka-Williams,^[27] \"This was the unique new process that rapidly\nexchanges water between the cold and the warm and then spreads the effect of\nthe different water properties over a larger area\", more efficiently than the\nbetter-known processes that mix warm surface waters with cold water from the\ndeep sea.^[26] This action rapidly warms the cold water, which contributes to\nrising sea levels, as water becomes less dense as it warms.^[28] This newly\ndiscovered action has not yet been included in models for predicting sea level\nrise and the effect of climate change on the ocean.^[29] The results were\npublished in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.^[30]\n\nA subsequent voyage for Boaty in 2017 was in the North Sea. Fitted with new\nchemical and acoustic sensors, these will enable Boaty to seek, or 'sniff out'\ntraces indicating the artificial release of gas from beneath the seabed.^[6]\nThis will be part of a world first 'real world' controlled experiment in deep-\nwater, in order to simulate any potential release of gas that may be\nindicative of leakage from a carbon capture and storage reservoir; and will be\nled by the NOC.^[6]\n\nFollowing on from her North Sea exploits, Boaty will head north in a major\ntechnical challenge, and attempt the first ever under-ice crossing of the\nArctic Ocean.^[6]^[needs update]\n\nStarting March 2017, Boaty provided a package of online educational resources,\nprimarily for teachers in low-attaining primary and secondary schools, as an\naid to improving learning in STEM (science, technology, engineering and\nmathematics) subjects for pupils.^[6] This material from Boaty was also made\navailable to the general public.^[6]\n\nDuring January and February 2018, Boaty completed her first mission under-ice.\nShe was deployed in the southern section of the Weddell Sea, spending a total\nof 51 hours under the Antarctic ice. Part of the Filchner Ice Shelf System\nProject, she travelled a total of 108 kilometres (67 miles) and reached water\ndepths of 944 metres (3,097 feet) during the mission. Boaty spent 20 hours\nunderneath a 550 metres (1,800 feet) thick section of ice shelf.^[1]\n\nOn 3 November 2020, Boaty headed for the open seas to start trials before a\nscheduled trip to Antarctica in 2021 for climate change research.^[31]^[needs\nupdate]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Autonomous underwater vehicle\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c ^d ^e ^f ^g ^h ^i ^j ^k ^l \"Boaty McBoatface\".
