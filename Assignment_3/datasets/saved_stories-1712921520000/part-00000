This is a rate of 10 football pitches a minute, often driven by more\nland being brought under agricultural cultivation around the world.\n\nWhile Brazil and Colombia recorded large drops in forest loss of 36% and 49%\nrespectively, under the environmental policies of presidents Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula\nda Silva and Gustavo Petro, those falls were offset by big increases in\nBolivia, Laos, Nicaragua and other countries.\n\nCanada also experienced a record-breaking loss of forest due to fire, losing\nmore than 8m hectares (20m acres).\n\nMikaela Weisse, director of Global Forest Watch at the WRI, said: \u201cThe world\ntook two steps forward, two steps back when it comes to this past year\u2019s\nforest loss.\n\nGraph\n\n\u201cSteep declines in the Brazilian Amazon and Colombia show that progress is\npossible, but increasing forest loss in other areas has largely counteracted\nthat progress,\u201d she said. \u201cWe must learn from the countries that are\nsuccessfully slowing deforestation.\u201d\n\nChanges in land use \u2013 of which deforestation is a central component \u2013 is the\nsecond-largest source of greenhouse-gas emissions and a main driver of\nbiodiversity loss. Preserving rainforests is essential to limit global heating\nto 1.5C (2.7F) above pre-industrial levels, according to researchers.\n\nA railway linking Kunming in China with Vientiane in Laos runs under a highway\nnear Phonhong, Laos, where Chinese demand has fuelled agricultural expansion.\nPhotograph: Reuters\n\nExperts have warned that continuing deforestation means governments are\ndangerously off-track when it comes to meeting their climate and biodiversity\ncommitments. At the Cop28 climate conference in Dubai, governments agreed on\nthe need to halt and reverse the loss and degradation of forests by 2030,\nafter a commitment by world leaders at Cop26 in Glasgow to end their\ndestruction this decade.\n\nBut the new figures show that the world is a long way from meeting this\ntarget, with little change in global forest loss for several years.\n\nWhile Brazil had significantly slowed its rate of forest loss, the country\nremained one of the top three countries for losing primary rainforest,\nalongside the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Bolivia. Together, they\naccounted for more than half of the total global destruction.\n\nBolivia recorded a major surge in forest loss for the third consecutive year \u2013\ndespite having less than half of the forest of other major rainforest\ncountries such as the DRC and Indonesia \u2013 driven largely by the expansion of\nsoya farming.\n\nLaos and Nicaragua lost major chunks of their remaining untouched rainforest\nin 2023, clearing 1.9% and 4.2% respectively in a single year, which\nresearchers said was because highly fragmented forests in countries that had\nalready been cleared extensively can often be more quickly erased.\n\nIn Laos, agricultural expansion is being fuelled by demand from China for\ncommodities, while in Nicaragua, cattle ranching and expanding agriculture are\nto blame.\n\n\u2018We don\u2019t know where the money is going\u2019: the \u2018carbon cowboys\u2019 making millions\nfrom credit schemes\n\nRead more\n\nDespite the lack of overall progress in the figures for 2023, researchers said\nthe world could learn from the examples of Brazil and Colombia to meet\ndeforestation targets.\n\nProf Matthew Hansen, a specialist in remote sensing at the University of\nMaryland\u2019s geography department, said: \u201cI really believe the only way to\nmaintain standing forests is a compensation fund for conserving standing\nrainforests.\n\n\u201cGermany has floated the \u2018Fair Deal\u2019, which is meant to pay rainforest\ncountries in this manner. Norway has engaged with Gabon in a similar way,\nusing carbon sequestration as the measure. Couple that approach with robust\ngovernance and civil society engagement, and it might work,\u201d he said.\n\nFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters\nPhoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on X for all the latest news and features\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Deforestation\n  * The age of extinction\n  * Brazil\n  * Colombia\n  * Conservation\n  * Americas\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Trees and forests\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
