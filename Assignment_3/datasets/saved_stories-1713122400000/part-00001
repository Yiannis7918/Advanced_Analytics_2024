Well, here are some surprising things about how\nwe use it:\n\n(But first, a caveat: there are a LOT of ways to use GPT in products \u2013 I think\nwe haven\u2019t even discovered the most valuable ones yet. A lot of the more novel\nways to use GPT, though, like assistants and agents, we just haven\u2019t found\nvery useful in practice, at least in B2B SaaS. They\u2019re just unreliable and too\nwonky. Not yet anyway!)\n\nIn our product, we primarily use GPT for these 4 cases, ranked in decreasing\norder of value:\n\nClassification. Given a block of text, what type is it, from this list?\n\nData extraction. Here\u2019s a JSON schema and a block of text, fill out the JSON\nschema.\n\nLong-summary. Write an email that summarizes this block of text.\n\nShort-summary. Give me 2-3 words to describe this block of text, so I can use\nit as a header (think, the ChatGPT summaries of each convo listed on the\nright).\n\nNotice something interesting? The top 2 use-cases are things traditional ML\ncan do really well.\n\nSo why are we using GPT and not traditional ML?\n\nMy previous company did a lot of traditional ML, and my main takeaway was that\nit was incredibly expensive to produce something valuable. This made it hard\nto experiment. It made it hard to maintain these features.\n\nBut now, I can literally spend a few minutes writing a prompt.\n\nSo why is it the new Heroku?\n\nWhat is (was) special about Heroku? It\u2019s a very, very expensive infrastructure\nplatform (relatively to rolling it yourself) that promises (and delivers) on\nthe value proposition: no devops needed.\n\nYou can be a normal engineer and have a very scalable, very stable, very\nrobust app (complete with logging, restarts, alerts, patches, high\navailability, zero trust, secret management, etc, etc) without needing to know\nany devops.\n\nAnd the expensiveness is ok, because it scales directly with usage, pay-as-\nyou-go.\n\nThis is exactly what OpenAI has given developers with GPT: a very, very\nexpensive way to do ML features without needing an ML team. It\u2019s actually not\neven that expensive compared to the value, but it is expensive compared to\ncheaper locally run LLMs and using a traditional ML model, once it\u2019s been\ntrained.\n\nThere\u2019s one final overlooked aspect to this\n\nEven if the personnel costs of hiring ML engineers weren\u2019t prohibitive to\nstartups, on top of that, traditional ML is impossible to do without large\namounts of training data. That\u2019s a huge moat.\n\nStartups have a bootstrapping problem when it comes to the training data for\nML features.\n\nBut GPT is zero shot. That is huge. It means that the barrier to entry to ML\nfeatures is now effectively zero.\n\nConclusion\n\nI like thinking about OpenAI this way because it also explains why Google is\nhaving such a problem capturing this space.\n\nGoogle fundamentally doesn\u2019t have the problem that GPT (the API) primarily\nsolves. It has gobs of money. It has gobs of ML expertise. It doesn\u2019t want to\nbuild something that chips away at that moat.\n\nOf course, GPT does a lot more than substitute in for traditional ML\noperations. But that\u2019s where I\u2019ve seen the value in practice right now, and\nboy is it valuable! It\u2019ll be fascinating to see where all this goes.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * Reddit\n  * Email\n\nUncategorized\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\n### About This Site\n\nThis may be a good place to introduce yourself and your site or include some\ncredits.\n\n### Find Us\n\nAddress 123 Main Street New York, NY 10001\n\nHours Monday\u2014Friday: 9:00AM\u20135:00PM Saturday & Sunday: 11:00AM\u20133:00PM\n\n### Categories\n\n  * Hiring\n  * Management\n  * Security\n  * Series: Core Controls for the Transcendent CISO\n  * Technology\n  * Uncategorized\n\n### Recent Posts\n\n  * GPT is the Heroku of AI\n  * Lessons after a half-billion GPT tokens\n  * The Parable of the Wise Hiring Manager\n  * Learnings from 5 years of tech startup code audits\n  * The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Secure-by-default\n  * You Don\u2019t Need Hundreds of Engineers to Build a Great Product\n  * Technology ROI Discussions are Broken\n  * 5 Software Engineering Foot-guns\n  * The Backlog Peter Principle\n  * How to find great senior engineers\n  * The Googler\u2019s Dilemma: Why Experience Will Always Have a Premium\n  * 5 Red Flags Signaling Your Rebuild Will Fail\n  * Core Control #6: Log Everything\n  * Core Control #5: Secure by Default\n  * Core Principle #4: Managing Privileged Access\n\n### Pages\n\n  * About\n  * Blog\n\n\u00a9 2024 Ken Kantzer's Blog\n\nTheme by Anders Noren \u2014 Up \u2191\n\n", "frontpage": false}
