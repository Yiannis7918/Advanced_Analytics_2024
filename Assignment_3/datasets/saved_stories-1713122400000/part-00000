(Photo by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.)\n\nThis essay was originally published on TomDispatch and is republished here\nwith Tom\u2019s kind permission.\n\nLook back on 2011 and you\u2019ll notice a destructive trail of extreme weather\nslashing through the year. In Texas, it was the driest year ever recorded. An\nepic drought there killed half a billion trees, touched off wildfires that\nburned 4 million acres, and destroyed or damaged thousands of homes and\nbuildings. The costs to agriculture, particularly the cotton and cattle\nbusinesses, are estimated at $5.2 billion \u2014 and keep in mind that, in a winter\nbreaking all sorts of records for warmth, the Texas drought is not yet over.\n\nIn August, the East Coast had a close brush with calamity in the form of\nHurricane Irene. Luckily, that storm had spent most of its energy by the time\nit hit land near New York City. Nonetheless, its rains did at least $7 billion\nworth of damage, putting it just below the $7.2 billion worth of chaos caused\nby Katrina back in 2005.\n\nGrist thanks its sponsors.

Wildfires consumed large swaths of\nChile. Colombia suffered its second year of endless rain, causing an estimated\n$2 billion in damage. In Brazil, the life-giving Amazon River was running low\ndue to drought. Northern Mexico is still suffering from its worst drought in\n70 years. Flooding in the Thai capital, Bangkok, killed over 500 and displaced\nor damaged the property of 12 million others, while ruining some of the\nworld\u2019s largest industrial parks. The World Bank estimates the damage in\nThailand at a mind-boggling $45 billion, making it one of the most expensive\ndisasters ever. And that\u2019s just to start a 2011 extreme-weather list, not to\nend it.\n\nSuch calamities, devastating for those affected, have important implications\nfor how we think about the role of government in our future. During natural\ndisasters, society regularly turns to the state for help, which means such\nimmediate crises are a much-needed reminder of just how important a functional\nbig government turns out to be to our survival.\n\nThese days, big government gets big press attention \u2014 none of it anything but\nterrible. In the United States, especially in an election year, it\u2019s become\nfashionable to beat up on the public sector and all things governmental\n(except the military). The right wing does it nonstop. All their talking\npoints disparage the role of an oversized federal government. Anti-tax zealot\nGrover Norquist famously set the tone for this assault. \u201cI\u2019m not in favor of\nabolishing the government,\u201d he said. \u201cI just want to shrink it down to the\nsize where we can drown it in the bathtub.\u201d He has managed to get 235 members\nof the House of Representatives and 41 members of the Senate to sign his\n\u201cTaxpayer Protection Pledge\u201d and thereby swear never, under any circumstances,\nto raise taxes.\n\nBy now, this viewpoint has taken on the aura of folk wisdom, as if the essence\nof democracy were to hate government. Even many on the left now regularly\ndismiss government as nothing but oversized, wasteful, bureaucratic, corrupt,\nand oppressive, without giving serious consideration to how essential it may\nbe to our lives.\n\nGrist thanks its sponsors.

Here's How\n\nBut don\u2019t expect the present \u201cconsensus\u201d to last. Global warming and the\nfreaky, increasingly extreme weather that will accompany it is going to change\nall that. After all, there is only one institution that actually has the\ncapacity to deal with multi-billion-dollar natural disasters on an\nincreasingly routine basis. Private security firms won\u2019t help your flooded or\ntornado-struck town. Private insurance companies are systematically\nwithdrawing coverage from vulnerable coastal areas. Voluntary community\ngroups, churches, anarchist affinity groups \u2014 each may prove helpful in\nlimited ways, but for better or worse, only government has the capital and\ncapacity to deal with the catastrophic implications of climate change.\n\nConsider Hurricane Irene: As it passed through the Northeast, states mobilized\nmore than 100,000 National Guard troops. New York City opened 78 public\nemergency shelters prepared to house up to 70,000 people. In my home state,\nVermont, where the storm devastated the landscape, destroying or damaging 200\nbridges, more than 500 miles of road, and 100 miles of railroad, the National\nGuard airlifted in free food, water, diapers, baby formula, medicine, and\ntarps to thousands of desperate Vermonters trapped in 13 stranded towns \u2014 all\nfree of charge to the victims of the storm.\n\nThe damage to Vermont was estimated at up to $1 billion. Yet the state only\nhas 621,000 residents, so it could never have raised all the money needed to\nrebuild alone. Vermont businesses, individuals, and foundations have donated\nat least $4 million, possibly up to $6 million in assistance, an impressive\nfigure, but not a fraction of what was needed. The state government\nimmediately released $24 million in funds, crucial to getting its system of\nroads rebuilt and functioning, but again that was a drop in the bucket, given\nthe level of damage. A little known state-owned bank, the Vermont Municipal\nBond Bank, also offered low-interest, low-collateral loans to towns to aid\nreconstruction efforts. But without federal money, which covered 80 to 100\npercent of the costs of rebuilding many Vermont roads, the state would still\nbe an economic basket case. Without aid from Washington, the transportation\nnetwork might have taken years to recover.\n\nAs for flood insurance, the federal government is pretty much the only place\nto get it. The National Flood Insurance Program has written 5.5 million\npolicies in more than 21,000 communities covering $1.2 trillion worth of\nproperty. As for the vaunted private market, for-profit insurance companies\nwrite between 180,000 and 200,000 policies [PDF] in a given year. In other\nwords, that is less than 5 percent of all flood insurance in the United\nStates. This federally subsidized program underwrites the other 95 percent.\nWithout such insurance, it\u2019s not complicated: Many waterlogged victims of\n2011, whether from record Midwestern floods or Hurricane Irene, would simply\nhave no money to rebuild.\n\nOr consider sweltering Texas. In 2011, firefighters responded to 23,519 fires.\nIn all, 2,742 homes were destroyed by out-of-control wildfires. But government\naction saved 34,756 other homes. So you decide: Was this another case of\nwasteful government intervention in the marketplace, or an extremely efficient\nuse of resources?\n\nFacing snowpocalypse without plows\n\nThe early years of this century have already offered a number of examples of\nhow disastrous too little government can be in the face of natural disaster,\nKatrina-inundated New Orleans in 2005 being perhaps the quintessential case.\n\nThere are, however, other less noted examples that nonetheless helped\nconcentrate the minds of government planners. For example, in the early spring\nof 2011, a massive blizzard hit New York City. Dubbed \u201csnowmageddon\u201d and\n\u201csnowpocalypse,\u201d the storm arrived in the midst of tense statewide budget\nnegotiations, and a nationwide assault on state workers (and their pensions).\n\nIn New York, Mayor Mike Bloomberg was pushing for cuts to the sanitation\ndepartment budget. As the snow piled up, the people tasked with removing it \u2014\nsanitation workers \u2014 failed to appear in sufficient numbers. As the city\nground to a halt, New Yorkers were left to fend for themselves with nothing\nbut shovels \u2014 their cars, doorways, stores, roads all hopelessly buried. Chaos\nensued. Though nowhere near as destructive as Katrina, the storm became a case\nstudy in too little governance and the all-too-distinct limits of \u201cself-\nreliance\u201d when nature runs amok. In the week that followed, even the rich were\nstranded amid the mounting heaps of snow and uncollected garbage.\n\nBloomberg emerged from the debacle chastened, even though he accused the union\nof staging a soft strike, a work-to-rule-style slowdown that held the\nsnowbound city hostage. The union denied engaging in any such illegal actions.\nWhatever the case, the blizzard focused thinking locally on the nature of\npublic workers. It suddenly made sanitation workers less invisible and forced\na set of questions: Are public workers really \u201cunion fat cats\u201d with\n\u201csinecures\u201d gorging at the public trough? Or are they as essential to the\nbasic functions of the city as white blood cells to the health of the human\nbody? Clearly, in snowbound New York it was the latter. No sanitation workers\nand your city instantly turns chaotic and fills with garbage, leaving street\nafter street lined with the stuff.\n\nMore broadly the question raised was: Can an individual, a town, a city, even\na state really \u201cgo it alone\u201d when the weather turns genuinely threatening?\nBriefly, all the union bashing and attacks on the public sector that had\nmarked that year\u2019s state-level budget debates began to sound unhinged.\n\nIn the Big Apple at least, when Irene came calling that August, Bloomberg was\nready. He wasn\u2019t dissing or scolding unions. He wasn\u2019t whining about the cost\nof running a government. He embraced planning, the public sector, public\nworkers, and coordinated collective action. His administration took\nunprecedented steps like shutting down the subway and moving its trains to\nhigher ground. Good thing they did. Several low-lying subway yards flooded.\nHad trains been parked there, many millions in public capital might have been\nlost or damaged.\n\nThe secret history of free enterprise in America\n\nWhen thinking about the forces of nature and the nature of infrastructure, a\nslightly longer view of history is instructive. And here\u2019s where to start: In\nthe U.S., despite its official pro-market myths, government has always been\nthe main force behind the development of a national infrastructure, and so of\nthe country\u2019s overall economic prosperity.\n\nOne can trace the origins of state participation in the economy back to at\nleast the founding of the republic: from Alexander Hamilton\u2019s First Bank of\nthe United States, which refloated the entire post-revolutionary economy when\nit bought otherwise worthless colonial debts at face value; to Henry Clay\u2019s\nhalf-realized program of public investment and planning called the American\nSystem; to the New York State-funded Erie Canal, which made the future Big\nApple the economic focus of the eastern seaboard; to the railroads, built on\ngovernment land grants, that took the economy west and tied the nation\ntogether; to New Deal programs that helped pulled the country out of the Great\nDepression and built much of the infrastructure we still use, like the Hoover\nDam, scores of major bridges, hospitals, schools, and so on; to the\ngovernment-funded and sponsored interstate highway system launched in the late\n1950s; to the similarly funded space race, and beyond. It\u2019s simple enough: Big\ngovernment investments (and thus big government) have been central to the\nremarkable economic dynamism of the country.\n\nGovernment has created roads, highways, railways, ports, the postal system,\ninland waterways, universities, and telecommunications systems. Government-\nfunded research and development, as well as the buying patterns of government\nagencies \u2014 alas, both often connected to war and war-making plans \u2014 have\ndriven innovation in everything from textiles and shipbuilding to telecoms,\nmedicine, and high-tech breakthroughs of all sorts. Individuals invent\ntechnology, but in the United States it is almost always public money that\nbrings the technology to scale, be it in aeronautics, medicine, computers, or\nagriculture.\n\nWithout constant government planning and subsidies, American capitalism simply\ncould not have developed as it did, making ours the world\u2019s largest economy.\nYes, the entrepreneurs we are taught to venerate have been key to all this,\nbut dig a little deeper and you soon find that most of their oil was on public\nlands, their technology nurtured or invented thanks to government-sponsored\nR&D, or supported by excellent public infrastructure and the possibility of\nhiring well-educated workers produced by a heavily subsidized higher-education\nsystem. Just to cite one recent example, the now-familiar Siri voice-activated\ncommand system on the new iPhone is based on \u2014 brace yourself \u2014 government-\ndeveloped technology.\n\nAnd here\u2019s a curious thing: Everybody more or less knows all this, and yet it\nis almost never acknowledged. If one were to write the secret history of free\nenterprise in the United States, one would have to acknowledge that it has\nalways been and remains at least a little bit socialist. However, it\u2019s not\nconsidered proper to discuss government planning in open, realistic, and\nmature terms, so we fail to talk about what government could \u2014 or rather, must\n\u2014 do to help us meet the future of climate change.\n\nStorm socialism\n\nThe onset of ever more extreme and repeated weather events is likely to change\nhow we think about the role of the state. But attitudes toward the Federal\nEmergency Management Agency (FEMA), which stands behind state and local\ndisaster responses, suggest that we\u2019re hardly at that moment yet. In late\n2011, with Americans beleaguered by weather disasters, FEMA came under attack\nfrom congressional Republicans, eager to starve it of funds. One look at FEMA\nexplains why.\n\nYes, when George W. Bush put an unqualified playboy at its helm, the agency\ndealt disastrously with Hurricane Katrina back in 2005. Under better\nleadership, however, it has been anything but the sinister apparatus of\nrepression portrayed by legions of rightists and conspiracy theorists. FEMA\nis, in fact, an eminently effective mechanism for planning focused on the\npublic good, not private profit, a form of public insurance and public\nassistance for Americans struck by disaster. Every year FEMA gives hundreds of\nmillions of dollars to local firefighters and first responders, as well as\nvictims dealing with the aftershock of floods, fires, and the other calamities\nassociated with extreme weather events.\n\nThe agency\u2019s work is structured around what it calls \u201cthe disaster life cycle\u201d\n\u2014 the process through which emergency managers prepare for, respond to, and\nhelp others recover from and reduce the risk of disasters. More concretely,\nFEMA\u2019s services include training, planning, coordinating, and funding state\nand local disaster managers and first responders, grant-making to local\ngovernments, institutions, and individuals, and direct emergency assistance\nthat ranges from psychological counseling and medical aid to emergency\nunemployment benefits. FEMA also subsidizes long-term rebuilding and planning\nefforts by communities affected by disasters. In other words, it actually\nrepresents an excellent use of your tax dollars to provide services aimed at\nrestoring local economic health and so the tax base. The anti-government right\nhates FEMA for the same reason that they hate Social Security \u2014 because it\nworks!\n\nAs it happens, thanks in part to the congressional GOP\u2019s sabotage efforts,\nthousands of FEMA\u2019s long-term recovery projects are now on hold, while the\ncash-strapped agency shifts its resources to deal with only the most immediate\ncrises. This represents a dangerous trend, given what historical statistics\ntell us about our future. In recent decades, the number of Major Disaster\nDeclarations by the federal government has been escalating sharply: only 12 in\n1961, 17 in 1971, 15 in 1981, 43 in 1991, and in 2011 \u2014 99! As a result, just\nwhen Hurricane Irene bore down on the East Coast, FEMA\u2019s disaster relief fund\nhad already been depleted from $2.4 billion as the year began to a mere $792\nmillion.\n\nLike it or not, government is a huge part of our economy. Altogether, federal,\nstate, and local government activity \u2014 that is, collecting fees, taxing,\nborrowing and then spending on wages, procurement, contracting, grant-making,\nsubsidies, and aid \u2014 constitutes about 35 percent of the gross domestic\nproduct. You could say that we already live in a somewhat \u201cmixed economy\u201d:\nthat is, an economy that fundamentally combines private and public economic\nactivity.\n\nThe intensification of climate change means that we need to acknowledge the\nchaotic future we face and start planning for it. Think of what\u2019s coming, if\nyou will, as a kind of storm socialism.\n\nAfter all, climate scientists believe that atmospheric concentrations of\ncarbon dioxide beyond 350 parts per million (ppm) could set off compounding\nfeedback loops and so lock us into runaway climate change. We are already at\n392 ppm. Even if we stopped burning all fossil fuels immediately, the\ndisruptive effect of accumulated CO2 in the atmosphere is guaranteed to hammer\nus for decades. In other words, according to the best-case scenario, we face\ndecades of increasingly chaotic and violent weather.\n\nIn the face of an unraveling climate system, there is no way that private\nenterprise alone will meet the threat. And though small \u201cd\u201d democracy and\n\u201ccommunity\u201d may be key parts of a strong, functional, and fair society,\nvolunteerism and \u201cself-organization\u201d alone will prove as incapable as private\nenterprise in responding to the massive challenges now beginning to unfold.\n\nTo adapt to climate change will mean coming together on a large scale and\nmobilizing society\u2019s full range of resources. In other words, big storms\nrequire big government. Who else will save stranded climate refugees, or\nprotect and rebuild infrastructure, or coordinate rescue efforts and plan out\nthe flow and allocation of resources?\n\nIt will be government that does these tasks or they will not be done at all.\n\nA message from\n\n#### All donations DOUBLED!\n\nGrist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable\nsolutions to climate change.
