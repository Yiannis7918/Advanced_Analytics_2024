Other symptoms include feeling as if one's environment is\nlacking in spontaneity, emotional coloring, and depth.^[1] It is a\ndissociative symptom that may appear in moments of severe stress.^[2]\n\nDerealization is a subjective experience pertaining to a person's perception\nof the outside world, while depersonalization is a related symptom\ncharacterized by dissociation towards one's own body and mental processes. The\ntwo are commonly experienced in conjunction with one another, but are also\nknown to occur independently.^[3]\n\nChronic derealization is fairly rare, and may be caused by occipital\u2013temporal\ndysfunction.^[4] Experiencing derealization for long periods of time or having\nrecurring episodes can be indicative of many psychological disorders, and can\ncause significant distress. However, temporary derealization symptoms are\ncommonly experienced by the general population a few times throughout their\nlives, with a lifetime prevalence of up to 26\u201374% and a prevalence of 31\u201366%\nat the time of a traumatic event.^[5]\n\n## Description\n\nThe experience of derealization can be described as an immaterial substance\nthat separates a person from the outside world, such as a sensory fog, pane of\nglass, or veil. Individuals may report that what they see lacks vividness and\nemotional coloring.^[6] Emotional response to visual recognition of loved ones\nmay be significantly reduced. Feelings of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu or jamais vu are common.\nFamiliar places may look alien, bizarre, and surreal. One may not even be sure\nwhether what one perceives is in fact reality or not. The world as perceived\nby the individual may feel as if it were going through a dolly zoom effect.\nSuch perceptual abnormalities may also extend to the senses of hearing, taste,\nand smell.\n\nThe degree of familiarity one has with their surroundings is among one's\nsensory and psychological identity, memory foundation and history when\nexperiencing a place. When persons are in a state of derealization, they block\nthis identifying foundation from recall. This \"blocking effect\" creates a\ndiscrepancy of correlation between one's perception of one's surroundings\nduring a derealization episode, and what that same individual would perceive\nin the absence of a derealization episode.\n\nFrequently, derealization occurs in the context of constant worrying or\n\"intrusive thoughts\" that one finds hard to switch off. In such cases it can\nbuild unnoticed along with the underlying anxiety attached to these disturbing\nthoughts, and be recognized only in the aftermath of a realization of crisis,\noften a panic attack, subsequently seeming difficult or impossible to ignore.\nThis type of anxiety can be crippling to the affected and may lead to avoidant\nbehavior. Those who experience this phenomenon may feel concern over the cause\nof their derealization. It is often difficult to accept that such a disturbing\nsymptom is simply a result of anxiety, and the individual may often think that\nthe cause must be something more serious. This can, in turn, cause more\nanxiety and worsen the derealization. Derealization also has been shown to\ninterfere with the learning process, with cognitive impairments demonstrated\nin immediate recall and visuospatial deficits.^[7] This can be best understood\nas the individual feeling as if they see the events in third person.^[8]\n\n## Causes\n\nDerealization can accompany the neurological conditions of epilepsy\n(particularly temporal lobe epilepsy), migraine, and mild TBI (head\ninjury).^[9] There is a similarity between visual hypo-emotionality, a reduced\nemotional response to viewed objects, and derealization. This suggests a\ndisruption of the process by which perception becomes emotionally colored.\nThis qualitative change in the experiencing of perception may lead to reports\nof anything viewed being unreal or detached.^[4]\n\nThe instances of recurring or chronic derealization among those who have\nexperienced extreme trauma and/or have post-traumatic stress (PTSD) have been\nstudied closely in many scientific studies, whose results indicate a strong\nlink between the disorders, with a disproportionate amount of post traumatic\nstress patients reporting recurring feelings of derealization and\ndepersonalization (up to 30% of those with the condition) in comparison to the\ngeneral populace (only around 2%),^[10] especially in those who experienced\nthe trauma in childhood. Many possibilities have been suggested by various\npsychologists to help explain these findings, the most widely accepted\nincluding that experiencing trauma can cause individuals to distance\nthemselves from their surroundings and perception, with the aim of\nsubsequently distancing themselves from the trauma and (especially in the case\nof depersonalisation) their emotional response to it. This could be either as\na deliberate coping mechanism or an involuntary, reflexive response depending\non circumstance.^[11] This possibly not only increases the risk of\nexperiencing problems with derealization and its corresponding disorder, but\nwith all relevant dissociative disorders. In the case of childhood trauma, not\nonly are children more likely to be susceptible to such a response as they are\nless able to implement more healthy strategies to deal with the emotional\nimplications of experiencing trauma, there is also a lot of evidence that\nshows trauma can have a substantial detrimental effect on learning and\ndevelopment, especially since those who experience trauma in childhood are far\nless likely to have received adequate parenting.^[11] These are factors proven\nto increase susceptibility to maladaptive psychological conditions, which of\ncourse includes dissociative disorders and subsequently derealization\nsymptoms.\n\nSome neurophysiological studies have noted disturbances arising from the\nfrontal-temporal cortex, which could explain the correlation found between\nderealization symptoms and temporal lobe disorders. This is further supported\nby reports of people with frontal lobe epilepsy, with those with epilepsy of\nthe dorsal premotor cortex reporting symptoms of depersonalization, while\nthose with temporal lobe epilepsy reported experiencing derealization\nsymptoms.^[12] This implies that malfunction of these specific brain regions\nmay be the cause of these dissociative symptoms, or at the very least that\nthese brain regions are heavily involved.\n\nDerealization is a common psychosomatic symptom seen in various anxiety\ndisorders, especially hypochondria.^[13] However, derealization is presently\nregarded as a separate psychological issue due to its presence as a symptom\nwithin several pathologies.\n\nDerealization and dissociative symptoms have been linked by some studies to\nvarious physiological and psychological differences in individuals and their\nenvironments. It was remarked that labile sleep-wake cycles (labile meaning\nmore easily roused) with some distinct changes in sleep, such as dream-like\nstates, hypnogogic, hypnopompic hallucinations, night-terrors and other\ndisorders related to sleep could possibly be causative or improve symptoms to\na degree.^[14] Derealization can also be a symptom of severe sleep disorders\nand mental disorders like depersonalization disorder, borderline personality\ndisorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, dissociative identity disorder, and\nother mental conditions.^[15]\n\nCannabis,^[16] psychedelics, dissociatives, antidepressants, caffeine, nitrous\noxide, albuterol, and nicotine can all produce feelings of derealization, or\nsensations mimicking them,^[17] particularly when taken in excess. It can also\nresult from alcohol withdrawal or benzodiazepine withdrawal.^[18] Tramadol\nwithdrawal can also cause feelings of derealization, often alongside psychotic\nsymptoms such as anxiety, paranoia and hallucinations.^[19]\n\nInteroceptive exposure exercises have been used in research settings as a\nmeans to induce derealization, as well as the related phenomenon\ndepersonalization, in people who are sensitive to high levels of anxiety.\nExercises with documented successes include timed intervals of\nhyperventilation or staring at a mirror, dot, or spiral.^[20]\n\n## Popular culture\n\nDerealization, as a concept, is referenced in the 2021 comedy special by Bo\nBurnham called Bo Burnham: Inside; specifically, it is mentioned in the song\n\"That Funny Feeling\".^[21]\n\n## See also\n\n  * depersonalization-derealization disorder\n  * Brain fog\n  * \u015a\u016bnyat\u0101\n  * Ego death\n  * Temporal lobe epilepsy\n  * Post-traumatic stress disorder\n  * Dissociative disorders\n  * Existential crisis\n  * Mystical psychosis\n  * Narcissistic withdrawal\n  * Spiritual emergency\n  * Solipsism syndrome\n  * Fugue state\n  * Reality\n  * Spectacle\n  * Falling (sensation)\n  * Weltschmerz\n  * Sleep deprivation\n  * Neoplatonism\n\n## References\n\n  1. ^ American Psychiatric Association (2004).
