They discovered a microbial\nenzyme - citrate synthase from a cyanobacterium - that spontaneously assembles\ninto a pattern known as the Sierpinski triangle. Electron microscopy and\nevolutionary biochemistry studies indicate that this fractal may represent an\nevolutionary accident.\n\n\u00a9 MPI f. Terrestrial Microbiology/ Hochberg\n\n\u00a9 MPI f. Terrestrial Microbiology/ Hochberg\n\nSnowflakes, fern leaves, romanesco cauliflower heads: many structures in\nnature have a certain regularity. Their individual parts resemble the shape of\nthe whole structure. Such shapes, which repeat from the largest to the\nsmallest, are called fractals. But regular fractals that match almost exactly\nacross scales, as in the examples above, are very rare in nature.\n\nMolecules also have a certain regularity. But if you look at them from a great\ndistance, you can no longer see any signs of this. Then you see smooth matter\nwhose features no longer match those of the individual molecules. The degree\nof fine structure we see depends on our magnification - in contrast to\nfractals, where self-similarity persists at all scales. In fact, regular\nfractals at the molecular level are completely unknown in nature.\n\nThis is somewhat surprising. After all, molecules can assemble themselves into\nall sorts of wonderful shapes. Scientists have extensive catalogues of self-\nassembled complex molecular structures. However, there has never been a\nregular fractal among them. It turns out that almost all regular-looking self-\nassemblies lead to the kind of regularity that becomes smooth on large scales.\n\nAn international team of researchers led by groups from the Max Planck\nInstitute in Marburg and Phillips University in Marburg has now discovered the\nfirst regular molecular fractal in nature. They discovered a microbial enzyme\n- citrate synthase from a cyanobacterium - that spontaneously assembles into a\nregular fractal pattern known as the Sierpi\u0144ski triangle. This is an\ninfinitely repeating series of triangles made up of smaller triangles. \u2018We\nstumbled on this structure completely by accident and almost couldn\u2019t believe\nwhat we saw when we first took images of it using an electron microscope\u2019 says\nfirst author Franziska Sendker. \u2018The protein makes these beautiful triangles\nand as the fractal grows, we see these larger and larger triangular voids in\nthe middle of them, which is totally unlike any protein assembly we\u2019ve ever\nseen before\u2019 she continues.\n\nHow did this unusual exception emerge? What distinguishes the enzyme from all\nothers, causing it to form a fractal shape? Teaming up with structural\nbiologist at the university of Marburg, the team eventually managed to\ndetermine the molecular structure of this assembly using electron microscopy,\nwhich illuminated how it achieves its fractal geometry. \u2018This was one of the\nharder, but also more fascinating structures I have solved in my career\u2019 says\nJan Schuller, whose group helped determine the structure. \u2018The problem with\ndetermining the structure of a fractal is that our image averaging techniques\nkept getting confused by the fact that the smaller triangles can be\nsubstructures of larger triangles. The algorithm kept homing in on these\nsmaller triangles instead of seeing the larger structures they were part of\u2019\nhe explains.\n\n## Asymmetry leads to fractal formation\n\nMany fractal structures, for example in clouds or river deltas (above) are\ncreated by random processes and do not follow an exact mathematical formula; a\nsmaller river bed does not correspond exactly to the structure of the larger\nchannel from which it branches off. Ferns (bottom left) and Romanesco\ncauliflower, on the other hand, are examples of regular fractals.\n\n\u00a9 MPI f.

Terrestrial Microbiology/ Hochberg\n\nWith the structure in hand, it became clear how exactly this protein manages\nto assemble into a fractal: Normally, when proteins self-assemble, the pattern\nis highly symmetrical: each individual protein chain adopts the same\narrangement relative to its neighbours. Such symmetrical interactions always\nlead to patterns that become smooth on large scales. The key to the fractal\nprotein was that its assembly violated this rule of symmetry. Different\nprotein chains made slightly different interactions at different positions in\nthe fractal. This was the basis for forming the Sierpi\u0144ski triangle, with its\nlarge internal voids, rather than a regular lattice of molecules.\n\nDoes this bizarre assembly do anything useful? \u2018Self-assembly is often used by\nevolution to regulate enzymes, but in this case the cyanobacterium that this\nenzyme is found in does not seem to care much whether or not its citrate\nsynthase can assemble into a fractal\u2019, says evolutionary biologist Georg\nHochberg, one of the senior authors of the study. When the team genetically\nmanipulated the bacterium to prevent its citrate synthase from assembling into\nthe fractal triangles, the cells grew just as well under a variety of\nconditions. \u2018This prompted us to wonder whether this might just be a harmless\naccident of evolution. Such accidents can happen when the structure in\nquestion isn\u2019t too difficult to construct\u2019.\n\n## Replaying evolution in the lab\n\nTo test their theory, the team recreated the evolutionary development of the\nfractal arrangement in the laboratory. To do this, they used a statistical\nmethod to back-calculate the protein sequence of the fractal protein as it was\nmillions of years ago. By then producing these ancient proteins biochemically\nthey were able to show that the arrangement arose quite suddenly through a\nvery small number of mutations and was then immediately lost again in several\ncyanobacterial lineages, so that it only remained intact in this single\nbacterial species. \u2018Although we can never be totally sure of the reasons why\nthings happened in the past, this particular case does have all the trappings\nof a seemingly complex biological structure that just popped into existence\nfor no good reason at all because it was simply very easy to evolve\u2019 says\nHochberg.\n\nThe fact that something so complex-looking as a molecular fractal could emerge\nso easily in evolution suggests that more surprises and much beauty may still\nlie hidden in so far undiscovered molecular assemblies of many biomolecules.\n\n  * Science Magazine\n  * Events\n  * Images of Science\n  * On Location\n  * Infographics\n  * Press Newsletter\n\nContact\n\n#### Dr. Georg Hochberg\n\nMax Planck Research Group Leader Max Planck Institute for Terrestrial\nMicrobiology, Marburg +49 6421 28-25441 georg.hochberg@mpi-marburg.mpg.de\n\n#### Dr. Franziska Sendker\n\nMax Planck Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology, Marburg\nfranziska.sendker@mpi-marburg.mpg.de\n\n#### Dr. Virginia Geisel\n\nPress Officer Max Planck Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology, Marburg +49\n160 91387-362 virginia.geisel@mpi-marburg.mpg.de\n\nOriginal publication\n\nSendker, F.L.; Lo, J.K.; Heimerl, T.; Bohn, S.; Persson, L-J.; Mais, C.N.;\nSadowska, W.; Paczia, N.; Nu\u00dfbaum, E.; del Carmen S\u00e1nchez Olmos, M.;\nForchhammer.
