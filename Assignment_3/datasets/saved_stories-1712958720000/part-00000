It\nmakes prompt engineering much easier and enables you to build LLM apps with\nproduction quality.\n\nWith prompt flow, you will be able to:\n\n  * Create flows that link LLMs, prompts, Python code and other tools together in a executable workflow.\n\n  * Debug and iterate your flows, especially the interaction with LLMs with ease.\n\n  * Evaluate your flows, calculate quality and performance metrics with larger datasets.\n\n  * Integrate the testing and evaluation into your CI/CD system to ensure quality of your flow.\n\n  * Deploy your flows to the serving platform you choose or integrate into your app\u2019s code base easily.\n\n  * (Optional but highly recommended) Collaborate with your team by leveraging the cloud version of Prompt flow in Azure AI.\n\n> Welcome to join us to make prompt flow better by participating discussions,\n> opening issues, submitting PRs.\n\nThis documentation site contains guides for prompt flow sdk, cli and vscode\nextension users.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Quick Start\n\nQuick start and end-to-end tutorials.\n\n\\- Getting started with prompt flow - E2E development tutorial: chat with PDF\n- Find more: tutorials & samples\n\n\ud83d\udcd2 How-to Guides\n\nArticles guide user to complete a specific task in prompt flow.\n\n\\- Develop a flow - Initialize and test a flow - Run and evaluate a flow -\nTune prompts using variants - Develop custom tool - Deploy a flow - Process\nimage in flow\n\n\ud83d\udcd1 Concepts\n\nIntroduction of key concepts of prompt flow.\n\n\\- Flows - Tools - Connections - Design principles\n\n\ud83d\udd0d Reference\n\nReference provides technical information about prompt flow API.\n\n\\- Command line Interface reference: pf - Python library reference: promptflow\n- Tool reference: LLM Tool, Python Tool, Prompt Tool\n\nnext\n\nQuick Start\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2024, Microsoft.\n\nCreated using Sphinx 5.1.0.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
