But now I have the hands-on experience I need to cast aside\n(most of) the doubt: The Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite is the real deal, an Arm-\nbased chipset for PCs that achieves what many thought impossible. It doesn\u2019t\njust rival the best that the PC world has to offer, it surpasses the most\nrecent Intel and AMD chipsets across CPU, GPU, and NPU. It also bests Apple\u2019s\nlatest mainstream Mac chipset, the Apple Silicon M3. It often does so by a\nwide margin.\n\nI know. You\u2019re waiting for the asterisk, the qualifying \u201cbut\u201d that starts the\nsecond half of the sentence. So let me get that out of the way first. After\nover seven years of disappointment and broken promises, 12 years if you count\nWindows RT, it\u2019s important to have all the information and not get caught up,\nyet again, in a level of hype and excitement that far surpasses reality.\n\n## Windows Intelligence In Your Inbox\n\nSign up for our new free newsletter to get three time-saving tips each Friday\n\u2014 and get free copies of Paul Thurrott's Windows 11 and Windows 10 Field\nGuides (normally $9.99) as a special welcome gift!\n\n\"*\" indicates required fields\n\nWhen one says that the X Elite chipsets\u2014more on that \u201cs\u201d in a bit\u2014\u201csurpass,\u201d\n\u201cbest,\u201d or \u201cbeat\u201d other chipsets, whether they\u2019re x64 designs from Intel or\nAMD or Arm-based designs from Apple, what they\u2019re referring to is benchmarks.\nBenchmarks that measure such things as performance and efficiency across the\nCPU, GPU, and NPU that\u2019s present in each of these SoCs (systems on a chip).\nI\u2019m not a fan of benchmarks, never have been, and I specifically do not\nbenchmark the hardware that I review, preferring instead to report on my real-\nworld experiences in using these devices.\n\nI can\u2019t do that\u2014yet\u2014for the X Elite as there are no computers available to me\nor other reviewers\u2014yet\u2014that feature these chipsets. There will be soon:\nQualcomm has been promising new PCs from a variety of PC makers by mid-2024\nsince last October, and that message was repeated at a meeting I and several\nother reviewers had with the company in New York this past week. In lieu of\nthose coming experiences, we\u2019ve had to rely on what Qualcomm claims\u2014which,\nyes, we should treat skeptically\u2014and, more recently, on leaked benchmark\ntests. Both have been so exuberantly positive, and such a sharp contrast with\nour previous Windows on Arm experiences as to be suspicious.\n\nI feel an acute weight of responsibility. It has been clear to me for years\nthat Arm, or an Arm-like SoC architecture, is the future of PCs for the same\nreasons that it\u2019s already taken over the rest of the world. But it is equally\nclear to me that Windows on Arm has consistently failed to deliver on the\npromises. And that these failures, as is so often the case, can be tied to a\ncombination of issues, and not any one thing. Not helping matters, Apple\nembarrassed the PC world yet again when it announced and then methodically\ndelivered on its own seamless and successful transition to Arm with the Mac\nand Apple Silicon.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t about me not wanting to look foolish. It\u2019s about Microsoft and\nits ecosystem partners giving Windows another 10 years of runway, if you will,\nthe difference between an inertia-based future in which Windows continues to\ndecline and a healthier path by which Windows remains viable for desktop,\nproductivity-based uses cases. This is a potential extinction moment for the\nplatform I happen to care about the most and continue to bet my career on.\n\nWithout getting into the history, which is both convoluted and lengthy, let\u2019s\njust say that, sitting here in early 2024, the final missing piece of the\npuzzle for Windows on Arm is the silicon. Qualcomm\u2019s PC-focused chipsets, to\ndate, have under-performed. So, again, we are understandably suspicious that\nthey have suddenly turned it around.\n\nBut let\u2019s also acknowledge that the turnaround\u2014and it very much appears to be\na turnaround\u2014is not really all that sudden. After working for several years to\nadapt its smartphone-based chipsets for the PC and running into nothing but\nperformance roadblocks, Qualcomm finally threw in the towel in early 2021 and\nacquired Nuvia, a company that\u2014like Apple with its M-series chipsets\u2014took the\nArm architecture and heavily adapted it to make it make sense on a PC. That\ninvolves creating a more efficient and performant way of emulating x64\nsoftware code than is possible on traditional Arm chipsets, and it is perhaps\nnotable that Nuvia had been founded two years earlier by two former Apple\nSilicon chipset designers. Anyway, this turnaround has been three years in the\nmaking. Or five, if you date it back to Nuvia\u2019s origins. There\u2019s nothing\nsudden about it.\n\nWe\u2019re still a few months away from real, shipping hardware from major PC\nmakers like Lenovo, HP, and Dell, and Microsoft, which is expected to unveil\nnew Snapdragon-based Surface PCs as soon as mid-May. (Surface Laptop and\nSurface Pro 10, reportedly.) But we\u2019re also months removed from the October X\nElite announcement. And in the interim, we experienced a growing crescendo of\nleaks, along with a few hints from Qualcomm, that this chipset is the real\ndeal. That it matches or exceeds the performance and efficiency of its\nmainstream, modern competition.\n\nIt is perhaps not coincidental that Apple announced its newest-generation M3\nchipsets just days after Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon X Elite reveal. Most Apple fans\nwill chafe at the notion that their favorite company, so far ahead of its\nrivals in the PC space when it comes to that magical combination of\nperformance and battery life, would feel any pressure from Qualcomm,\nespecially in the PC space. But the timing is nonetheless interesting, and it\ncertainly had an impact in our small corner of the world. Here was Qualcomm,\nfavorably comparing its latest Arm chipset for PCs to what was now the\nprevious-generation M2 chipset. But Apple had once again leaped forward and\nput Qualcomm and the PC industry in the rearview mirror. We had a good six-day\nrun.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the full story. Now, Qualcomm is sharing benchmark comparisons\nbetween the X Elite and Apple Silicon M3. And sorry, Apple fans, but the X\nElite isn\u2019t just competitive, it comes out ahead in some key benchmarks too.\nTo be clear, this is the \u201cbase\u201d M3, the chip that\u2019s in my MacBook Air, and not\nthe M3 Pro or M3 Max that powers Apple\u2019s most expensive Macs. But the X Elite\nspecifically targets the same mainstream sweet spot of the market that Apple\ntargets with its MacBook Air. So this comparison is valid, or apples to Apple,\nif you will.\n\nAnd Qualcomm has finally allowed reporters, bloggers, and reviewers like\nmyself to put our grubby hands on their reference design laptops, to run\nbenchmarks on our own without any intervention or interference. They showed us\na coming generation of apps that are being customized for the unique strengths\nof the X Elite, in particular its best-in-class NPU. And as important, it\nshowed off several PC games, all running in emulation without any hitches or\nother issues.\n\nI learned more than I expected during this post-meeting, hour-long hands-on\nexperience. Including, go figure, that there are at least two different\n\u201cversions\u201d of the X Elite chipset, running at different base clock speeds.\nIt\u2019s not clear how or if Qualcomm will market these, indeed they were\nreluctant to discuss it, noting only that it would not imitate a \u201ccertain\ncompany\u201d by confusing the market with multiple SKUs (product editions).\nKnowing the PC market as well as I do, I suspect there was some call for some\nvariety, however. So we\u2019ll see how that turns out.\n\nHere\u2019s what I can tell you for now, based on quick examinations of Task\nManager and System settings across multiple Qualcomm reference PCs. There\u2019s a\nSnapdragon X Elite X1E84100 with a base clock speed of 3.8 GHz and versions at\n4.0 GHz and 4.2 GHz at the least. Each features the same NPU with the same\nmarket-leading 45 TOPS of AI accelerated performance (and, I\u2019m guessing, the\nsame GPU, but that I can\u2019t state certainly). The PCs I used were configured\nwith 16, 32, or 64 GB of RAM, and it\u2019s fast LPDDRx5 RAM.\n\nWhen Microsoft first announced Windows 10 on Arm with Qualcomm back in late\n2016, the combination was marketed as the Always Connected PC, and the\nadvantage of this platform were threefold: Efficiency, battery life, and 5G\nconnectivity (hence, the brand name). In other words, it was a new push to\nbring the best of mobile\u2014smartphone and tablet, but mostly smartphone\u2014to the\nlegacy PC platform. That was always real, but we\u2019re all familiar with the\nresulting performance issues and Qualcomm\u2019s inability to deliver on its \u201cCore\ni5-level performance\u201d promises.\n\nWith the X Elite and this new generation of Arm PCs, Qualcomm appears to have\nblown by the performance concerns. And it, with Microsoft, is expanding the\nadvantages of this platform to include local AI capabilities. Here, the\nconcerns are all upended. On the one hand, Qualcomm is in a leadership\nposition with its NPU, exceeding even the performance of Apple\u2019s Neural\nEngine. And it is Microsoft and the software ecosystem that are bringing up\nthe rear, with precious little to show when asked why anyone would even need\nsuch a thing in a PC. There\u2019s no software.\n\nThere will be. And you\u2019ve already seen what is arguably the most important\nsingle app cross the Arm finish line: Google announced the stable release of\nan Arm-native version of its dominant Chrome web browser two weeks ago, a\nstunning level of support from a company that has done absolutely nothing to\nhelp Windows, ever, in supporting a platform that today has a user base of\nroughly zero. Google, inexplicably, has formally acknowledged Windows on Arm\nas a viable, important platform. And Chrome running on Windows on Arm is even\nbetter, in some ways, than it is on today\u2019s PCs: It\u2019s 20 percent faster than\nChrome for x64 in the Speedometer 2.1 benchmark. (Yes, Speedometer 3.0 was\njust released. We should have numbers for that soon as well.)\n\nIt\u2019s not just Chrome. Microsoft Edge is 57 percent faster on Arm, and Brave is\n15 percent faster. From an app launch latency perspective, we\u2019re seeing other\nArm advantages, too. Microsoft Teams is 38 percent faster, Mozilla Firefox is\n62 percent faster. Steam is 39 percent faster. Spotify is 69 percent faster.\nAnd Adobe Photoshop is 7 percent faster. Running natively on Arm matters.\n\nBut so, too, does x64 emulation, since most software is not yet tailored for\nArm, a process that could involve various levels of work on the part of\ndevelopers. (You may recall that Microsoft offers an Arm64EC framework that\nlets developers upgrade parts of existing apps to Arm in addition to the usual\nporting/recompiling capabilities.) And we saw evidence that both scenarios are\nexperiencing a renaissance of sorts.\n\nOn the emulation front, Qualcomm let us play three x64 games\u2014all desktop apps\nacquired from the Epic Games Store\u2014on their references PCs using an Xbox\nwireless controller: Baldur\u2019s Gate, Control, and Redout. I stuck largely to\nthe latter, a racing game, and experienced smooth, glitch-free performance\nwith a consistent 35 to 40 FPS at 1080p. I hear you, gamers are looking for 60\nFPS. But this isn\u2019t a gaming rig, it\u2019s a reference laptop using a chipset\nthat\u2019s aimed at Ultrabooks, running games in emulation. That\u2019s impressive. And\nI watched others play Baldur\u2019s Gate and Control with similar glitch-free\nperformance, and was similarly impressed.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for native apps, they\u2019re coming, as are native apps in which\ncore workloads are being optimized specifically or the X Elite and its\npowerful NPU. It\u2019s not clear to me which of these apps are using Arm64EC, not\nthat it matters. But companies like Adobe, Microsoft, Netflix, Spotify, and\nmany others have updated for Arm or are doing so.\n\nAs important, they\u2019re also being updated for the X Elite NPU specifically. And\nthese hands-on demos were particularly notable, and hint at the solution to\nthat gaping hole in the AI story for Windows: So-called AI PCs are all well\nand good, but when are we going to see a killer app that will trigger a wave\nof PC upgrades? Is there some app that will do for the NPU what Chrome will do\nfor Arm?\n\nThat depends on your needs. But the demos that Qualcomm let us experience\nshowed off will be compelling to content creators of all kinds. OBS Studio,\nwhich I use regularly for screen recordings, is getting several NPU upgrades\nto core components this year, starting with one that can display captions with\nreal-time language translations as you speak. The DaVinci Resolve video editor\nis using the X Elite NPU to track a person or other object in video, also in\nreal-time. And Audacity is using the NPU to create music of any kind, with or\nwithout lyrics, using a text prompt. I experienced each of these advances\npersonally and was blown away in each case.\n\nLooking ahead, one can reasonably expect Microsoft to use Build 2024 in May to\nannounce that key AI experiences\u2014new and existing\u2014in Windows and its in-box\napps will be updated to use the NPU when it makes sense. And that Copilot,\nbroadly\u2014in Windows, on the web, in Microsoft 365, and elsewhere\u2014will move to a\nhybrid model that takes advantage of local AI acceleration when possible,\noffloading to the cloud otherwise. I suspect there will be third-party\nannouncements then as well. But whatever these announcements involve, this is\nthe year that the ecosystem makes its push for local AI. And Qualcomm, with\nthe best NPU by far, is poised to capitalize on that.\n\nCircling back to the core value proposition here, Windows on Arm will make\nsense when we achieve full compatibility via a combination of native apps and\nemulation that\u2019s so good you don\u2019t even know it\u2019s happening. It will make\nsense when the performance of those apps is so good you don\u2019t have to think or\nworry about it. It will make sense when the average battery life of PCs rises\nfrom today\u2019s dismal 5 to 6 hours to something well north of 10 hours,\nhopefully 15 hours. It will make sense when PC makers can finally build\ncompromise-free laptops without any fans or noise that can take on the MacBook\nAir head-to-head.\n\nBased on all the evidence, most especially my recent hands-on time with\nSnapdragon X Elite reference design laptops, it\u2019s now clear that this era,\nlong derided as a fantasy, is upon us. It\u2019s happening.\n\nYes, we still have more to learn, and real-world experience with real,\nshipping PC laptops will tell the full tale. But exuberance about the\nSnapdragon X Elite no longer feels irrational. Indeed, it feels quite\nrational: This chipset and its successors have given Microsoft the runway it\nneeds to drive Windows forward for the next decade. I hate to declare \u201cmission\naccomplished,\u201d as we all know how that can work out. But I feel good.\n\nReally good.\n\n### Tagged with\n\n  * Qualcomm\n  * Windows on ARM\n  * Windows 11 on Arm\n  * Snapdragon X Elite\n\n### Share post\n\nPlease check our Community Guidelines before commenting\n\n## About author\n\n#### Paul Thurrott\n\nPaul Thurrott is an award-winning technology journalist and blogger with over\n25 years of industry experience and the author of 30 books.
