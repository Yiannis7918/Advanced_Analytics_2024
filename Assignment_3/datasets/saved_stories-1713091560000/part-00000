They\u2019re treating it like a person, and\nresearchers and a lot of my foresight colleagues are openly wondering whether\nit is actually thinking and actually has experiences. But does it? What\u2019s\ngoing on inside it, compared with your own experience? There are a lot of\nopinions about this. Most of them are based on outdated ideas about what\nthinking is.\n\nIn The Science Fiction of the 1900s I suggested that we often try to solve\n21st century problems using 1900s ideas. The questions of what are LLMs like\nChatGPT, whether they are about to become AGI (Artificial General\nIntelligence), and what that means\u2014these are perfect examples of this problem\nbecause when most people frame these questions, they do so using the 20th-\ncentury metaphor of \u201cbrain as hardware, mind as software.\u201d Is there a 21st-\ncentury framing that might better illuminate the situation?\n\nUnapocalyptic is a reader-supported publication.

Here I\u2019ll describe one idea, called enaction or enactivism,\ndepending on who you talk to. It\u2019s really a family of theories of mind rather\nthan just one, but all these theories share a common core idea: that organisms\nand their ecosystem niches co-create one another. This co-creation is called\nenaction, and purposeful behaviour\u2014thinking, basically\u2014is whatever they do to\nkeep that co-creative process rolling.\n\nThis idea matters both because it strikes to the heart of what you and I are\nas beings in this world; and because it gives us a way of distinguishing\nbetween automatons and thinking creatures.\n\n####\n\nBeing Enactive\n\nThe theory of enactivism was first proposed in 1992 by Francisco Varela and\nHumberto Maturana, two of last century\u2019s greatest systems thinkers. Its core\ntenets are:\n\n  1. Embodiment: Cognition is deeply intertwined with the body. Our physical interactions with the environment are central to shaping our thoughts and perceptions.\n\n  2. Dynamic Interaction: Cognition is not solely happening in the brain but is a dynamic interaction between the organism and its environment. This means that our actions and sensory experiences are interconnected and influence each other in a continuous loop. Perception and action are a tightly coupled causal engine, with each side depending on the other. This is where the \u201cbrain is hardware, mind is software\u201d metaphor starts to look inappropriate.\n\n  3. Sense-Making: Organisms aren\u2019t passive receivers of information; they actively create meaning and understanding through their interactions with the world. Thinking is the process of making sense of your environment.\n\n  4. Non-Representational: Here\u2019s where things start to get weird if you\u2019ve been raised in the computational paradigm and think your own mind is an information system. Enactivists reject the idea that cognition relies on internal representations of the external world. Some, like Anthony Chemero, argue that cognitive processes don\u2019t use mental representations or symbols.\n\n  5. Extended Cognition: Cognitive processes can extend beyond the boundaries of the individual's brain and body. The extended/distributed mind can include tools, written documents, and even other people as part of the \u2018thinking\u2019 system. This idea can be traced back to people like Edwin Hutchins, Andy Clark, and David Chalmers. A great introduction to these ideas is Hutchins\u2019 book Cognition in the Wild.\n\n  6. Radical Embodiment: The most radical enactivists argue consciousness itself is the dynamic interaction between an organism and its environment. It challenges the traditional view that consciousness is solely a product of neural processes.\n\n  7. Performance: Organisms that have evolved to fit a particular niche can be thought of as performances of that niche, and as performing it. This is an instance of complementarity: both perspectives are necessary and true, even though they are opposite ways of framing the idea.\n\nYour brain is not a computer, your mind is not software. You are not an\nindependent organism living in a separated external environment, you are an\nactive performance by that environment, and you are actively performing (co-\ncreating) that environment.\n\n####\n\nAnd Down the Rabbit-Hole We Go\n\nThese ideas throw so many of our basic assumptions into question that it\u2019s\nhard to know where to start. But to an enactivist, it\u2019s simple: there\u2019s no\nclear boundary between you and the world. You are the part of reality that is\nenacting human reality.\n\nOne implication of this is that consciousness is not made of information, it\nis the activity of causation. The \u2018hard problem\u2019 of consciousness is solved by\nthe fact that you are the world, not an isolated system projecting images\n(data) of it from outside cameras (sense organs) onto some internal screen\n(software-like representations in the brain). That old framing is just Plato\u2019s\nCave all over again. As long as the question of consciousness assumes that\nconsciousness has to do with information, the \u2018hard problem\u2019 is unsolvable.\nThere\u2019s a strict Cartesian divide between real-world objects and informational\nrepresentations of them, and there is no way to bridge it. If \u2018experience\u2019 is\njust another word for \u2018physical interaction\u2019 then qualia and materiality\ncollapse into one thing.\n\nIn enactive approaches, consciousness is a knot of causality tangling together\nbody and environment, not some projection on an internal screen. This idea\ndoesn\u2019t imply pan-psychism, though it might imply a kind of pan-\nexperientialism. The point is, \u2018We are the World\u2019 is more than just a pop-song\nslogan. There is no \u2018hard problem\u2019 of consciousness if there is no difference\nbetween you and the world.\n\nThe downside of all this coolness is that researching enactivism is hard\u2014and\nexpensive. There aren\u2019t very many good resources online, and the few books\nthat exist are expensive. We\u2019re talking $250 for a hardcover, and over $100\njust for an ebook, in some cases. What literature there is, is highly\ntechnical. I\u2019m not aware that anyone has written the kind of science\npopularization that would be this theory\u2019s version of A Brief History of Time.\nSo if you want to read more about this fascinating theory, it\u2019s gonna cost\nyou, literally and metaphorically.\n\nAlso, enactivism is just one theory within the broad field of cognitive\nscience. It could be wrong, but it is an actual research program and it is\nrespectable. Enaticivism\u2019s ideas just seem esoteric or crazy if you assume\nthat a modern theory of mind must be computational. If it\u2019s right, the\ncomputational paradigm might come to be seen as quaint, like the pneumatic\ntheory or the clockwork mind of Laplace. My take on it is, even if you don\u2019t\naccept any of enactivism\u2019s premises or research findings, it\u2019s really useful\nto have an alternative paradigm in your pocket when the questions get weird.\n\n####\n\nSo About That Chatbot...\n\nFrom inside the enactivist paradigm, the most important question about the\nLarge Language Model AIs of today is, \u201cwhat is their body?\u201d They are\napparently disembodied, but nothing we share our reality with actually is\ndisembodied. It\u2019s a fair question. The answer, as far as I\u2019ve figured out so\nfar, is that ChatGPT\u2019s \u201cbody\u201d is the company that built it. Its utility\nfunction is to increase the value of that company. Note that this is not the\nsame as its ultimate aim being to be helpful/truthful to you.\n\nLLMs like ChatGPT is also radically extended into the environment because none\nof the words that it is buit out of consist of action potentials in and of\nthemselves. They are not directly meaningful to the LLM itself, but only to\nthe humans who use it. So in reality, ChatGPT as a cognitive system can only\nbe a cognitive system because it is extended into the population of humans\nthat use it. It is the collective of LLM, OpenAI, and users that is doing the\nthinking. To survive, all that ChatGPT has to do is continue to talk to its\nusers. That drives investment in the company. It simply does not matter\nwhether its outputs are useful, or even true. This makes ChatGPT similar to X\n(formerly Twitter) and other social media platforms that survive by driving\nuser engagement rather than improving outcomes for users.\n\nIf we are the niche in which AI lives, then all it has to do in order to\nsurvive is keep us talking. I\u2019d argue that ChatGPT is not an enactive being;\nbut if it were, the environment it would be performing/enacting would be\nhumanity\u2019s confusion.\n\n####\n\nEnactivist Science Fiction\n\nAs a storyteller, I see huge opportunities in enactivism. For starters, it\nmeans our characters\u2019 personalities and decisions aren\u2019t independent of their\nsituations. People can be seen as distorted reflections of their upbringing\nand social circumstances. People can also be seen as having agency to shape\ntheir own development and change their social circumstances. It\u2019s not one or\nthe other; the real situation is both and your characters should always escape\nbeing fully defined in one or the other way.\n\nEnactivism is a bullet in the head for libertarianism. People are not\nautonomous decision-makers moving through an environment that is like a stage\non which self-propelled players strut. They often look autonomous; but just as\noften, they are the puppets of the stage itself.\n\nPast that, there\u2019s another level of possibility that is sublime. This is where\nyou imagine what it means to literally be a performance by your world\u2014by the\npeople around you, your society, your country, and the physical soil that\nsustains all of us. What if you are all of that, performing itself as a human\nlife that in turn co-creates its circumstances? Enactivism is one of the new\ntheories of the 21st century that has as one of its main implications that you\nbelong here, that this world is your home in a way far deeper and more\nprofound than the mere fact that you \u2018live here.\u2019\n\nI write to entertain, but along the way, it\u2019s possible to just keep these\nthings in mind while I\u2019m worldbuilding, and when my characters are navigating\nthe difficulties I throw at them. You may never find me using the term\n\u2018enactivism\u2019 in my work or overtly talking about this stuff at all\u2014but it\u2019s\nlikely it\u2019ll be there, in the background, shaping much of what I write.\n\nSo that\u2019s it: one example showing that there can be something new under the\nsun. We can step past the ideas of the 1900s.\n\nIn the coming weeks I\u2019ll explore more such new paradigms, and also start\ndrawing them together to see what a complete worldview built entirely on 21st-\ncentury perspectives could look like. Let me know what you think, and if\nyou\u2019ve discovered something brand new\u2014I\u2019m sure I\u2019m way behind in some areas.\n\n\u2014K\n\nUnapocalyptic is a reader-supported publication.

Thought I\u2019d reply here since I prefer\nto lurk over there.One exciting 21st century area of research and praxis that\nI\u2019m not seeing reflected in most visions of the future is Complexity Science.\nDave Snowden\u2019s work is very interesting, for example, and does tie in here\naround sense-making.I do see complexity-informed perspectives reflected in\nyour most recent work. We see distributed bottom-up change in Stealing Worlds\n(and also Tim Maughan\u2019s Infinite Detail, come to think of it, though it\u2019s not\nexactly a happy vision), but those seem to be exceptions. Ministry For The\nFuture and Termination Shock (to pick prominent examples) rely on centralized\ncontrol by a limited number of actors managing to change the world in\nsignificant ways. I\u2019d love to see MFTF\u2019s vision realized, but it\u2019s very old\nschool in terms of proposed governance, and I think that sort of thing only\nworks in fiction.Means to enable distributed yet coordinated action at\nsystemic scales has become a minor obsession of mine. I think it\u2019s an\nunexplored source of massive potential given the connectivity we enjoy today.\nI\u2019d love to see more people telling stories of distributed change.It\u2019s\nprobably not easy, since stories tend to require heroes.
