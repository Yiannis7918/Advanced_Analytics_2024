Ancient Roman texts and\narchaeological research provide valuable insights into viticulture and the\nmanufacture, trade and consumption of wine but little is known of the sensory\nnature of this prized commodity. Here, the authors offer a novel oenological\napproach to the study of Roman dolia through their comparison with modern\nGeorgian qvevri and associated wine-production techniques. Far from being\nmundane storage vessels, dolia were precisely engineered containers whose\ncomposition, size and shape all contributed to the successful production of\ndiverse wines with specific organoleptic characteristics.\n\n## Keywords\n\nItalyGeorgiaRoman archaeologyviticulturevinificationdoliaqvevri\n\nType\n\n    Research Article\n\nInformation\n\n    \n\nAntiquity , Volume 98 , Issue 397 , February 2024 , pp. 85 - 101\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.15184/aqy.2023.193 [Opens in a new window]\n\nCopyright\n\n    \n\nCopyright \u00a9 The Author(s), 2024. Published by Cambridge University Press on\nbehalf of Antiquity Publications Ltd\n\n## An underexplored phenomenon\n\nWine played a fundamental role in Greco-Roman Antiquity (Van Limbergen\nReference Van Limbergen2020). A quintessential tool in Roman winemaking was\nthe dolium, a large earthenware vessel with a rounded body, a flat base and a\nwide mouth that was used for fermenting, storing and ageing wines. Except for\nin Hispania\u2014where ancient texts and archaeology corroborate the use of free-\nstanding vessels (Varro, Res Rusticae 1.13.6; Hooper & Ash Reference Hooper\nand Ash2006; Pe\u00f1a Cervantes Reference Pe\u00f1a Cervantes, Van Limbergen, Dodd and\nBusanain press)\u2014dolia were routinely buried in the ground up to their mouths;\nhence the Latin term dolia defossa. Such wine cellars have been found all over\nItaly (Figure 1) and the western Roman world, but those of the Villa Regina\nand Pisanella farmhouses at Boscoreale near Pompeii (De Caro Reference De\nCaro1994; Feige Reference Feige2022; Figure 2) and the \u2018Villa of Augustus\u2019 at\nSomma Vesuviana (Aoyagi et al. Reference Aoyagi, De Simone, De Simone, Marzano\nand M\u00e9traux2018) remain the most famous and best-preserved examples. The\nwidespread and extensive use of these vessels is arguably the most striking\nfeature of Roman winemaking, yet the specifics of their role in vinification\n(the conversion of grape juice into wine through fermentation), as well as\ntheir influence on the organoleptic (visual and sensory) characteristics of\nRoman wine, remain ill-explored.\n\nFigure 1. Wineries with dolia defossa cellars in Italy (red dots). Stars\nindicate the major urban centres of Ravenna, Rome and Pompeii (map by D. Van\nLimbergen, using information from Van Limbergen Reference Van Limbergen2011;\nVan Oyen Reference Van Oyen2020; Dodd Reference Dodd2022; Feige Reference\nFeige2022).\n\nFigure 2. The dolia defossa wine cellars of (a) Regio II Insula 5 (Pompeii)\nand (b) Villa Regina (Boscoreale) (photographs by E. Dodd, courtesy of the\nMinistero della Cultura \u2013 Parco Archaeologico di Pompei); and (c) Tortoreto\nMuracche (Abruzzo) (photograph by Francesco Pizzimenti, courtesy of\nSoprintendenza Archeologia, Belle Arti e Paesaggio per le province di L'Aquila\ne Teramo).\n\nDolia have been a rather neglected category of pottery, in part due to their\nreputation as a generic class of coarse ware, unworthy of chrono-typology and\nin-depth study. In recent years, however, the tide has turned with studies of\ndolia production (Caratto & Cibecchini Reference Carrato and Cibecchini2020;\nCheung Reference Cheung2021; Cheung et al. Reference Cheung, Chang and\nTibbott2022) and their role in storage (Van Oyen Reference Van Oyen2020) and\ntrade (Marlier Reference Marlier2008). The most striking insights come from\narchaeometry, the results of which point to the use of specific, well-suited\nclays in the making of dolia and the export of finished vessels from renowned\nsource areas, over substantial distances (Manca et al. Reference Manca2016;\nCaratto Reference Carrato2017; Trojsi Reference Trojsi, Pensabene and\nSfameni2017; Carrato et al. Reference Carrato, Ferreras, Dautria and Bois2019;\nMontana et al. Reference Montana, Randazzo, Barca and Carroll2021; Carroll\nReference Carroll2022). Contrary to their modern reputation, these vessels\nwere highly valued items that were made by skilled artisans using specially\nselected clay mixtures.\n\nThe existence of specialised dolia workshops and the centrality of these\nvessels in Roman wine production indicate their intentional and systematic\nuse, in line with good practices and with the aim of obtaining certain desired\ncharacteristics within the wine. Grapes and the climate and environment in\nwhich they are grown contribute to the character of a wine (Jackson Reference\nJackson2008; Dougherty Reference Dougherty2012) but the dominant\ncharacteristics are generated during fermentation, maturation and ageing\n(Martins et al. Reference Martins, Garcia, Mendes, Costa Freitas, Gomes da\nSilva and Jo\u00e3o Cabrita2018), in this case inside dolia. Despite knowledge of\nthis fact, no study has yet scrutinised the role of these earthenware vessels\nin Roman winemaking and their impact on the look, smell and taste of ancient\nwines. Two barriers have prevented these inquiries. First, while Roman-period\ntexts do refer to wine organoleptic qualities and flaws, these aromas and\nflavours are never linked to specific winemaking techniques. Second, current\ninterpretations of these texts are largely influenced by modern industrial\nprocedures, which are of little use for understanding the nature of ancient\nwines.\n\nIn contemporary winemaking, earthenware vessels have been replaced by wooden,\nconcrete and steel containers. The use of large ceramic containers has,\nhowever, a long-standing tradition in the Mediterranean and beyond. The\nancient Greeks called these vessels \u2018pithoi\u2019 (Giannopoulou Reference\nGiannopoulou2010), while contemporary examples in Spain and Portugal are named\n\u2018tinajas\u2019 and \u2018talhas\u2019 (Issa-Issa et al. Reference Issa-Issa2021). In the\nsixteenth century, earthenware vessel fermentation also became widespread in\nChile and Peru up to the mid-nineteenth century (Sharratt et al. Reference\nSharratt, De France and Williams2019). But the most noteworthy incarnation of\nlarge earthenware vessels comes from the Caucasus, where wine production has\nbeen practised for over 8000 years (Maghradze et al. Reference Maghradze2016)\nand these vessels are known as \u2018qvevri\u2019 (Georgia) or \u2018karas\u2019 (Armenia).\nSustained for two millennia by Christianity, for both liturgy and consumption\n(Chkhartishvili & Maghradze Reference Chkhartishvili, Maghradze, Maghradze,\nRustioni, Turok, Scienza and Failla2012), the Georgian tradition is notable\nfor its persistence, being granted UNESCO World Intangible Cultural Heritage\nstatus in 2013 (Glonti & Glonti Reference Glonti and Glonti2013; Hovhannisyan\net al. Reference Hovhannisyan, Yesayan, Bobokhyan, Dallakyan, Hobosyan and\nGasparyan2017; Glonti Reference Glonti and Glonti2018; Figure 3).\n\nFigure 3. a\u2013b) a wine cellar with negatives of buried qvevri, Vardzia\nmonastery, Georgia, twelfth\u2013thirteenth century; c\u2013e) abandoned wine cellar and\nqvevri, Ikalto monastery, Georgia, fifteenth\u2013sixteenth century; f) modern\nwinery of Orgo, Teleda, Kakheti, Georgia (photographs by D. Van Limbergen).\n\nThe Caucasus region is considered a cradle of ancient winemaking and the\nearliest evidence for spherical ceramic containers comes from Early Neolithic\nsites in Georgia, dated c. 6000\u20135800 BC (McGovern et al. Reference\nMcGovern2017; Figure 4). The first attested use of fully buried ceramic\nvessels for vinification comes from neighbouring Armenia, where the Late\nChalcolithic Areni-1 cave has produced evidence of a winery with an\nearthenware vessel wine cellar dating to 4000\u20133500 BC (Barnard et al.\nReference Barnard, Dooley, Areshian, Gasparyan and Faull2011). Considerable\ngenetic affinity is also apparent between Roman grape cultivars and Georgian\n(and Caucasian) Vitis grapevines (Vouillamoz et al. Reference Vouillamoz,\nMcGovern, Ergul, S\u00f6ylemezo\u011flu, Tevzadze, Meredith and Grando2006; Myles et al.\nReference Myles2011; De Lorenzis et al. Reference De Lorenzis2019). All this\nevidence strengthens the case for a millennia-long transfer of cultivars and\ntechniques from east to west, perhaps brought to Italy through Phoenician and\nEtruscan contacts (McGovern Reference McGovern, Dodd and Van Limbergen2024).\nThis hypothesis is supported by the use of earthenware vessel fermentation at\nBronze Age Byblos along the Canaanite/Phoenician Lebanon coast (Brun Reference\nBrun2004: 59).\n\nFigure 4. Earthenware vessel decorated with grape motifs, Khramis Didi Gora,\nGeorgia, sixth millennium BC (photograph by D. Van Limbergen, picture courtesy\nof Georgian National Museum).\n\nThe Georgian evidence provides a unique opportunity to unravel procedures and\npathways in Roman vinification and, through this, to advance the debate on the\nnature of ancient wines. Dolia and qvevri are similar vessels in terms of\nmaterial, shape and setting and the winemaking process for both vessels is\nbroadly the same. Qvevri vinification procedures are, however, documented in\nmuch more detail. A comparative study therefore has the potential to greatly\nenhance our interpretation of the ancient textual sources on viticulture and\nwinemaking. In this article, we compare Roman and Georgian practices through\nthe lens of contemporary oenology to elucidate the fermentation process in\nlarge ceramic vessels. We focus on aspects including their burial in the\nground, shape, porosity and the role of skin-contact methods (when the grape\nskins remain in contact with the juice during winemaking) and flor yeasts\n(yeast cells that float on the surface of the wine).\n\n## Are qvevri wines a blueprint for Roman practices?\n\nThe basic course of vinification in both qvevri and dolia, as revealed by\nmodern anthropological observations and ancient sources, is remarkably\nsimilar. Fermentation in Roman winemaking was spontaneous and entirely\ndependant on the yeasts present on the grapes. This reliance on natural yeasts\npartly explains the practice of treading in Antiquity, with grapes gently\nsqueezed (without breaking stems and seeds, which imparts unpleasant flavours)\nand fermentation put in motion immediately to reduce the risk of failure.\nPrimary fermentation\u2014the first so-called tumultuous phase in which the bulk of\nthe sugars are turned into alcohol\u2014lasted nine to 30 days, during which the\ndolia were kept open. The jars were then topped up with more must (to minimise\nair contact) and sealed with a plastered terracotta disc (operculum) or wooden\nlid or simply with animal skins (Columella, Res Rustica 12.28.3, 12.39.2;\nForster & Heffner Reference Forster and Heffner2001). Occasionally, a second\nconvex terracotta cover (tectorium) provided further protection (Thurmond\nReference Thurmond2017). The use of such lids is confirmed archaeologically,\nas seen at Villa Regina and Pisanella (Dodd Reference Dodd2022: 470, fig. 14).\nJudging the correct moment to seal the dolia was not always easy, and Varro\n(Res Rustica 1.13.6; Hooper & Ash Reference Hooper and Ash2006) describes\ndolia cracking under the pressure of unreleased carbon dioxide. Once sealed,\nthe wine remained in the dolia for five to six months until they were opened\nat the spring equinox (Columella, Res Rustica 12.30; Forster & Heffner\nReference Forster and Heffner2001).\n\nIn modern Georgian winemaking, spontaneous by choice (and tradition), primary\nfermentation in qvevri lasts two to three weeks, during which the jars remain\nopen. When fermentation starts, the grape skins and solids rise to the surface\nbecause of the production of carbon dioxide, thus forming a \u2018cap\u2019 over the\nfermenting wine. In this phase, the skins and solids are regularly punched\ndown to keep them wet. After two to three weeks, the vessels are sealed with a\nstone or wooden lid and covered with earth, remaining so for six to nine\nmonths. The wine is then bottled for consumption or transferred into clean\nqvevri for ageing (Feiring Reference Feiring2016). This operational similarity\nto Roman winemaking is complemented by the materiality of the vessels. Qvevri\nare generally made from clay mixtures rich in minerals, which impart desirable\nwine aromas, in particular astringency (a drying sensation in the mouth). In\nthis regard, clay from Imereti in western Georgia is considered the best\n(Issa-Issa et al. Reference Issa-Issa2021). Archaeometry of Roman dolia\nremains rare, but the few existing studies point to clay compositions rich in\nminerals that are similar to Georgian dolia fabrics (Trojsi Reference Trojsi,\nPensabene and Sfameni2017; Carrato et al. Reference Carrato, Ferreras, Dautria\nand Bois2019; Montana et al. Reference Montana, Randazzo, Barca and\nCarroll2021). This suggests that Roman winemakers not only used similar\nequipment and procedures but were also aiming to make wines akin in character\nto those that are now produced in modern-day Georgia.\n\n## Porous eggs buried in the ground\n\nDolia and qvevri are porous vessels, which means that vinification is\noxidative. In both cases, however, excessive and harmful oxidation is\nprevented by the coating of vessel interiors with pitch (dolia) or beeswax\n(qvevri), which penetrate the clay, thus waterproofing and sterilising the\nvessels (Barisashvili Reference Barisashvili2011: 16\u201323). In some areas of the\nRoman Empire, wax or a mixture of wax and pitch was used (Geoponika 6.3\u20135;\nDalby Reference Dalby2011), but Pliny warns of the resulting sour taste in\nwine (Naturalis Historia 14.128; Rackham Reference Rackham2005) and Columella\nrecommends it instead for olive oil containers (Columella, Res Rustica\n12.52.16\u201317; Forster & Heffner Reference Forster and Heffner2001). The best\npitch came from Bruttium and Rhodes (Columella, Res Rustica 12.18.7; Geop.\n6.5). Pitching of vessels was undertaken 40 days before the vintage\n(Columella, Res Rustica 12.18.5) and repeated at least every two years for\nhygiene and efficiency (Geop. 6.5). This textual evidence for pitching is\nsupported by iconographic representations (e.g. a calendar mosaic from Saint-\nRomain-en-Gal) (Balmelle & Brun Reference Balmelle, Brun and Morlier2005) and\nethnography (from areas where earthenware vessels are still used, such as\nAlentejo, Portugal), and has been confirmed by gas chromatography-mass\nspectrometry of archaeological samples (Pereira & Silvino Reference Pereira,\nSilvino, Oliveira, Morais and Morillo Cerd\u00e1n2015; Dodd Reference Dodd2022:\n457). Both wood pitch and beeswax have excellent waterproofing capabilities,\nbut the vessels remain porous to a certain extent, and this permits a degree\nof micro-oxygenation. Unmanaged air contact turns wine into vinegar, but\ncontrolled oxidation can result in great wines because it concentrates colour\nand creates pleasant grassy, nutty and dried fruit-like flavours. As in\nGeorgia today, burying and sealing the vessels further ensured ideal\nconditions for making fine oxidative wines in Antiquity.\n\nWith their egg-like forms, the shapes of clay vessels such as qvevri and dolia\nplay another important role in the creation of quality wines. As primary\nfermentation produces carbon dioxide and changes the temperature inside these\nvessels, their ovoid shape creates internal convection currents (Figure 5).\nThese currents act as a kind of natural pumping system, gently stirring up\n(dead) yeasts, skins and other solids and slowly mixing them with the must\n(the squeezed grape juice). This continuous blending within the vessels\nenriches the texture of the wine and promotes uniformity in fermentation, and\nthus homogeneity in the must (Cheung Reference Cheung2021).\n\nFigure 5. Schematic representation of the fermentation process in dolia/qvevri\n(figure by D. Van Limbergen, dolia digital image by M. Garc\u00eda \u00c1vila, Cella\nVinaria Project).\n\nRoman vintners understood that burying dolia could protect the wine from\ntemperature variation (Pliny, Naturalis Historia 14.27; Rackham Reference\nRackham2005). Indeed, burying earthenware vessels ensures a constant\ntemperature inside them, providing a stable environment for the wine to\nferment and mature through the changing seasons. Fermentation temperature is\nclosely linked with vessel size and is particularly decisive for fermentation\nspeed (lower temperatures reduce the rate of fermentation) and wine\ncharacteristics (higher temperatures maximise colour and tannin extraction,\nwhile lower temperatures foster fruity flavours). Winemakers could therefore\nchoose between a variety of vessel sizes depending on the desired fermentation\npathway and wine style. Notably, there is great variability in the capacity of\ndolia in Roman wineries across Italy, ranging from 150\u20132000 litres (Carroll\nReference Carroll2022). Qvevri winemakers also use a variety of different\nsizes within a single cellar; capacities range from a few hundred litres to\n5000 litres but the most common size is 1000\u20132000 litres, as temperature\nregulation can be difficult in larger sizes.\n\nTemperatures inside qvevri commonly range between 13\u201315\u00b0C and 23\u201328\u00b0C, which\nis also ideal for malolactic fermentation or the conversion of tart malic\nacids into softer lactic acids during secondary fermentation. Today, the\nprocess is often prevented chemically for white wines, as high concentrations\nof its natural byproduct (diacetyl) give wines an excessively buttery taste\n(Robinson Reference Robinson2006). Diacetyl is, however, a key stabilising\nagent in maturing qvevri wines; lower concentrations are responsible for the\ncaramel and nutty tones of Georgian amber wines.\n\n## Skin-contact wines\n\nThe colour of wine in Antiquity is much debated (Tchernia & Brun Reference\nTchernia and Brun1999; Bouvier Reference Bouvier2000; Kourakou-Dragona\nReference Kourakou-Dragona2015: 103\u2013119; Thurmond Reference Thurmond2017:\n153\u20135). Pliny distinguishes four categories: albus (pale white), fulvus\n(reddish-yellow), sanguineus (bloody-red) and niger (dark, black; Pliny,\nNaturalis Historia 14.80; Rackham Reference Rackham2005). Greek sources\nhighlight similar differences distinguishing \u03bc\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03c2 (black), \u03bb\u025b\u03c5\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 (white),\n\u03ba\u03b9\u03c1\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 (orange-tawny; Atheneaus, Deipnosophistae. 32e; Douglas Olson Reference\nDouglas Olson2007), \u03be\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03cc\u03c2 (yellow) and \u025b\u03c1\u03c5\u03b8\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 (red; Hipp. De vict. Acut.\ncomm. 15.627k; Jones Reference Jones1923). This spectrum of wine colours is\ninfluenced by several factors during fermentation and storage. White wine, for\nexample, becomes darker with time through oxidation (Tchernia & Brun Reference\nTchernia and Brun1999) and this is often considered responsible for the\nyellowish-orange or tawny colour (\u03be\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03cc\u03c2, \u03ba\u03b9\u1fe4\u1fe5\u00f3\u03c2) of classical Antiquity's\nmost renowned wines (Chian, Lesbian, Falernian, Caecuban; Gal. MM 6.275,\n6.801, 10.834-835K; Johnston & Horsley Reference Johnston and Horsley2011;\nComp. Med. Loc. 13.513K; Vict. At. 94; Singer Reference Singer1997; Dsc. Mat.\nMed. 25.698; Beck Reference Beck2005). A few red-grape varieties are\n\u2018teinturiers\u2019, which produce berries with dark-coloured juice (e.g. Georgian\nSaperavi), and these may be responsible for the \u2018black\u2019 wines mentioned by\nancient authors (Brun Reference Brun2004; Boulay Reference Boulay2012;\nKourakou-Dragona Reference Kourakou-Dragona2015). A much more significant\neffect, however, comes from the maceration of the must with the pomace (the\nresidue of the skins, seeds and stems), which releases phenolic compounds.\n\nMaceration in modern winemaking is meant to extract colour from the grape\nskins for making ros\u00e9 and red wines. The process lasts from a few hours to\nseveral days or even weeks depending on the grapes\u2019 phenolic content and the\namount of colour desired (Robinson Reference Robinson2006). To this end,\npunching down the cap of grape solids that forms on top of the fermenting must\npromotes contact with the pomace. Maceration in this sense is not mentioned in\nthe ancient sources. Together with the agronomists\u2019 recommendation to transfer\nthe must to dolia shortly after pressing, this has generated the idea that\nRoman vinification made little use of maceration and was in essence a white-\nwinemaking process (Brun Reference Brun2003; Boulay Reference Boulay2012;\nHarutyunyan & Malfeito-Ferreira Reference Harutyunyan and Malfeito-\nFerreira2022). This interpretation, however, is much influenced by strict\nmodern distinctions between white and red wines, which did not existent in\nAntiquity. Ancient sources also do not state explicitly that the pomace needs\nto be removed. In fact, Columella mentions the clearing out of the wine dregs\nor lees\u2014the solid leftovers of winemaking consisting of dead yeast cells,\ngrape skins and seeds, concentrated as sediments\u2014only in the spring, when the\nnew wine was prepared for ageing (Columella, Res Rustica 12.28.4; Forster &\nHeffner Reference Forster and Heffner2001; Geoponika 7.15; Dalby Reference\nDalby2011). This implies that at least part of the pomace remained with the\nmust in the dolia during the entire fermentation cycle. Iconographic evidence\nfurther points to the recurrence of grape treading and pressing in Antiquity\ndirectly inside the jar in which the wine fermented, again suggesting\nfermentation on the skins (Kourakou Dragona Reference Kourakou-Dragona2015:\n111\u2013118). Finally, there is little evidence for the use of strainers in Roman\nwinemaking. Although filtering might have been achieved with utensils made of\norganic material (Thurmond Reference Thurmond2017: 155, fig. 23), at least\npart of the pomace must have remained in the wine and therefore maceration, to\nsome extent, took place.\n\nDirect bioarchaeological evidence for vinification on the lees inside Roman\ndolia remains elusive. The only confirmed example comes from \u2018Herod's Winery\u2019\nat Herodium, the winter palace of King Herod the Great, who ruled Judea from\n37\u20134 BC. His winery disposed of a large storage room filled with buried dolia\n(likely imported from Italy) in which the ample remains of grape seeds\nstrongly point to maceration (Porat et al. Reference Porat2018). The lack of\nfurther evidence may relate to the loss of material\u2014through the annual\ncleaning of dolia before the harvest and the emptying of dolia excavated prior\nto standardised archaeobotanical sampling (Alessandra Pecci pers.\ncomm.)\u2014rather than the absence of grape solids during vinification. Some\nsupport for this argument comes from the Early Imperial \u2018Gulf of Diano\u2019\nshipwreck off the Ligurian coast. The cargo included 14 large dolia, many of\nwhich contained residues with high levels of Vitis pollen, suggesting non-\nfiltered, macerated wines (Arobba et al. Reference Arobba, Caramiello and\nMartino1997\u20131998). Additional evidence for the existence of skin-contact\nvintages is provided by the attestation of grape seeds inside amphorae (Chic\nGarc\u00eda Reference Chic Garc\u00eda1978; Bryant & Murry Reference Bryant, Murry, Bass\nand Van Doorninck1982: 328\u20139; Bonet Rosado et al. Reference Bonet Rosado,\nFumad\u00f3 Ortega, Aranegui Gasc\u00f3, Hassini, Vives-Ferr\u00e1ndiz S\u00e1nchez and Gasc\u00f32005:\n131).\n\nProlonged maceration is a key feature of qvevri wines. Once primary\nfermentation inside a clay vessel is complete, the grape solids sink naturally\nto the bottom of the vessel, where they concentrate in its flat and narrow\nbase (Figure 5). At this stage, these solids are removed for red wines, but\nfor white wines they are left in contact with the must for several months to\nextract colour, tannins, phenols, flavours and anthocyanins. This results in\ndark yellow, amber-coloured wines, known as \u2018orange\u2019 wines, akin to what is\ndescribed in ancient Roman texts. In a pre-industrial world, this process\nwould have been decisive in a wine's keeping and ageing potential. The\nconcentration of lees and other solids in the vessel's narrow base minimises\ncontact with the maturing wine and reduces the risk of forming reductive\ncompounds (Barisashvili Reference Barisashvili2011). Instead, this setting\nensures the continuous and slow release of tannins, polyphenols and mono-\nproteins in the following months, all beneficial to wine stability (D\u00edaz et\nal. Reference D\u00edaz, Larie, Molina, Bucking and Fischer2013; Garrido & Borges\nReference Garrido and Borges2013). In particular, polyphenols act as natural\npreservatives due to their anti-oxidative, anti-fungal and anti-bacterial\nproperties (Guti\u00e9rrez-Escobar et al. Reference Guti\u00e9rrez-Escobar, Alia\u00f1o-\nGonz\u00e1lez and Cantos-Villar2021). This strengthens the case for extensive\nmaceration\u2014and the existence of dry, dark-coloured wines\u2014in Roman Antiquity.\n\n## The fundamental role of flor\n\nWine fermentation is typically caused by top-fermenting yeasts or\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae, which live on grape skins. But other strains from\nthe Saccharomyces and non-Saccharomyces genus\u2014called \u2018flor\u2019 (flower) in\nSpanish or \u2018voile\u2019 (veil) in French\u2014also grow naturally on the surface of wine\n(Cordero-Bueso et al. Reference Cordero-Bueso, Ruiz-Mu\u00f1oz, Gonz\u00e1lez-Moreno,\nChirino, Del Carmen Bernal-Grande and Cantoral2018; Ruiz-Mu\u00f1oz et al.\nReference Ruiz-Mu\u00f1oz, Hern\u00e1ndez-Fern\u00e1ndez, Cordero-Bueso, Mart\u00ednez-Verdugo,\nP\u00e9rez and Manuel Cantoral2022). Studies have shown the presence of various\nyeast varieties on Georgian grape skins, but Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains\ndominate wine samples and many of them are flor yeasts (Capece et al.\nReference Capece, Siesto, Poeta, Pietrafesa and Romano2013; Vigentini et al.\nReference Vigentini2016). These yeasts are also easily observed in most modern\nqvevri fermentations. Flor yeasts appear spontaneously in wild-fermented wines\n(Budroni et al. Reference Budroni, Giodano, Pinna and Farris2000) and they\ncreate a biofilm on the wine surface after fermentation, thus protecting the\nwine from unwanted oxidative effects (Alexandre Reference Alexandre2013;\nFigure 5). This layer, however, only grows on musts with high sugar contents\ncapable of producing wines of 14.5\u201316 per cent alcohol. Below that threshold,\nflor fails to develop and acetic fermentation occurs. Conversely, higher\nlevels of alcohol kill flor yeasts and cause oxidative ageing. For successful\nflor building, the wine container itself also needs to be porous as the yeasts\nconsume alcohol and weaken the must. In containers that do not allow for water\nevaporation during fermentation (such as stainless-steel tanks), this process\nturns wine into vinegar (Robinson Reference Robinson2006). Dolia and qvevri,\nhowever, are porous, and thus ideal for exploiting the protection of flor\nyeasts.\n\nAncient texts give ample evidence for the presence of surface yeasts in Greek\nand Roman wines. This velum is mentioned in the Geoponica as \u1f04\u03bd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2, whereas\nPliny and Columella refer to it as flos vini (Geoponika 7.15, 6; 6.3; Dalby\nReference Dalby2011; Pliny, Naturalis Historia 14.136; Rackham Reference\nRackham2005; Columella, Res Rustica 12.30; Forster & Heffner Reference Forster\nand Heffner2001). These \u2018flowers\u2019 could have various characteristics: white,\nflat and soft ones were beneficial; dark, yellow, red, glutinous or those\nresembling a spider's web were, conversely, noxious. The premature development\nof a velum\u2014presumably caused by other surface yeasts, such as the harmful\nCandida mycoderma\u2014was also considered a sign of wine spoilage (Pliny,\nNaturalis Historia 14.136; Geoponika 7.15). This elucidates Pliny's comments\non keeping weak (presumably less stable) wines in buried dolia and strong ones\nin freestanding vessels (Pliny, Naturalis Historia 14.132\u20135). Flor growth\ndepends on temperature (growth rates rise with increasing temperature), and\nweak wines exposed to the warm open air would have built flor too quickly,\ncausing the development of watery wines and acetic fermentation. Colder\nunderground conditions slowed down flor formation and inhibited alcohol loss,\nthough this was less of a problem for stronger wines, as the alcohol loss was\ninsufficient to start acetic fermentation.\n\nThere is little doubt that, just as with qvevri, ancient wines stored in dolia\nwere regularly subjected to flor yeasts (Komar Reference Komar2020: 87\u201395).\nSometimes the conditions needed for surface yeasts to act freely were probably\nnot met, for example, when salt or salty water (which increases alkalinity,\ninhibiting flor development) was added to prevent low-quality wines from\nturning into vinegar as a consequence of alcohol consumption by yeast (Cato,\nDe Agri Cultura 24, 105, 115, 158; Hooper & Ash Reference Hooper and Ash2006;\nColumella, Res Rustica 12.21; Forster & Heffner Reference Forster and\nHeffner2001; Pliny, Naturalis Historia 14.78\u201379; Rackham Reference\nRackham2005; Atheneaus, Deipnosophistae. 32e; Douglas Olson Reference Douglas\nOlson2007; Dsc. Mat.Med. 5.19; Beck Reference Beck2005), or when an overly\nthick application of inner pitch cover impeded oxidation. On the other hand,\ndolia (and qvevri) were made in specialised workshops, using specific clays\nand firing procedures aimed at obtaining ideal air permeability for wine\nfermentation, and hence flor formation. In addition, many Roman high-quality\nwines were made from raisined grapes, which produced musts with high sugar\nlevels ideal for flor building (Van Limbergen Reference Van Limbergen2017,\nReference Van Limbergen2020; Dodd Reference Dodd2020: 59\u201364). These surface\nyeasts produce several chemical compounds, including acetaldehyde and acetoin,\nbut most notably sotolon, which is responsible for the slightly spicy taste of\nflor wines (and indeed many qvevri wines), and imparts aromas of toasted\nbread, apples, roasted walnuts and curry (Robinson Reference Robinson2006).\nThe formation of sotolon depends on temperature (ideally between 15 and 35\u00b0C)\nand on pH levels (Thuy et al. Reference Thuy, Guichard, Schlich and\nCharpentier1995) and was likely promoted by the conditions obtained through\nthe burial of clay vessels. Experiments by Tchernia and Durand in the 1990s\nbased on Columella's advice resulted in amber-coloured wines with flor yeasts\nand aromas of sotolon, much like Georgian qvevri wines (Tchernia Reference\nTchernia1998; Tchernia & Brun Reference Tchernia and Brun1999).\n\nThe popularity of sotolon-induced dolia wines\u2014the characteristic of esteemed\nancient wines such as Falernian, Caecuban, Chain, Lesbian and Thasian\u2014is\nequally reflected in some of the procedures used for masking the taste of\nlower-quality wines, such as adding fenugreek to the must to imitate sotolon\nflavours (Columella, Res Rustica 12.21; Forster & Heffner Reference Forster\nand Heffner2001) or heating and smoking the fermented wine to produce nutty\nand caramel aromas in the more northern and colder areas of Italy and the\nwestern Roman world (Rossiter Reference Rossiter, Lavan, Zanini and\nSarantis2008; Busana Reference Busana, Van Limbergen and Doddin press).\nPopular practices, such as the pitching of wine containers, could also\ncontribute to the sensory experience of wine consumption.\n\n## The work ahead\n\nThe findings about earthenware vessel vinification presented here change much\nof our current understanding of Roman winemaking. Contrary to widespread\nbelief, it seems unlikely that most vinification in Antiquity was \u2018white\u2019 in\nthe sense of its modern meaning, that is, produced through fermentation\nwithout skins and solids. Instead, most grapes\u2014regardless of their berry\ncolour\u2014were vinified according to what we would today call red-wine\nvinification, with all solids present at least during primary fermentation.\nThis explains in large part the wide colour range of ancient wines, as\nattested in the ancient sources, and the ability of Roman vintners to make\nstable wines in an era without artificial additives and preservatives. It is\nalso clear that dolia were no ordinary class of pottery, but highly\nspecialised vessels whose size, shape, materiality and buried setting all\ncontributed decisively to the nature and quality of ancient wines. In\naddition, by considering the key role of natural yeasts, and in particular\nflors, we have argued that Roman wines were often characterised by aromas of\nsotolon, and that this specific organoleptic quality was considered an\nimportant feature of fine-quality wines.\n\nHere, we have shown how the study of contemporary and traditional clay vessel\nwines, informed by modern oenological knowledge, can fundamentally add to our\nunderstanding of Roman winemaking. Such interdisciplinary research, however,\nis only in its infancy and much remains to be done to understand fully the\nproduction and character of Roman wine. Substantially more archaeometric data,\nfrom both ancient dolia and modern qvevri, are needed to elucidate clay use in\nAntiquity, to explore the (dis)similarities in clay composition between\nancient and modern vessels and to further deepen our insights into the impact\nof different clays on organoleptic properties of wines. The same is true for\norganic residue analyses, as these will facilitate the comparison of the\nchemical compositions of earthenware vessel wines. Unlike concrete and\nstainless-steel tanks (which are neutral) and oak barrels (which add soft\nvanillin flavours), both much in use today, pottery vessels can contribute an\nenormous range of sensory properties to wine through their porosity and clay\ncomposition, many of which remain to be identified. A new generation of modern\nwinemakers is experimenting with ceramic vessel vinification, and a systematic\nscientific study of their efforts would be of great ethnoarchaeological value.\nWe also need DNA studies of yeast varieties, targeted in particular at the\ndetection of flor yeasts, to assess securely their importance in Roman and\nGeorgian winemaking. While we have focused on modern qvevri in this article, a\nsystematic and in-depth study of the wider wine earthenware vessel phenomenon\nis necessary to advance archaeological interpretation. In particular, a full\nre-evaluation of dolia wine cellars is required to capture the nature and\nextent of clay vessel wines in Antiquity. Finally, Roman winemaking techniques\nand wine sensory profiles are increasingly explored in experimental\narchaeology, and herein lie further exciting avenues for clay vessel\nvinification trials (Boulay Reference Boulay and Rudolph2018; Indelicato\nReference Indelicato2020). Such holistic studies will have a groundbreaking\nimpact on our views of Roman winemaking.\n\n## Funding statement\n\nThe research for this article was carried out by Dimitri Van Limbergen when\nfinanced by the Research Foundation \u2013 Flanders (FWO).
