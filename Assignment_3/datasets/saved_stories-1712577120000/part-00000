No injuries were reported.\n\nSouthwest said the plane \u201clanded safely after experiencing a mechanical\nissue,\u201d according to ABC News.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration announced on Sunday that it will\ninvestigate the incident on the Boeing 737-800, the latest involving the\naircraft manufacturer.\n\nA passenger, who gave the name Lisa C, told ABC News said the cowling detached\napproximately 10 minutes after boarding was completed.\n\n\"We all felt kind of a bump, a jolt, and I looked out the window because I\nlove window seats, and there it was,\" she told the outlet.\n\nAnother passenger, Cooper Glass, told ABC News that the incident was\n\"frightening,\" but that the pilot did an excellent job returning to the\nairport.\n\nSouthwest Airlines said its maintenance teams were examining the aircraft. The\naffected passengers were flown on another flight to Houston about three hours\nbehind their scheduled arrival time.\n\nThe incident is the latest in a string of issues to plague Boeing.\n\nThe engine cover on a Southwest-operated Boeing aircraft detaches as it leaves\nDenver International Airport on 7 April, 2024 (@SweeneyABC/X/Twitter)\n\nOn 5 January, a door plug panel on a new Alaska Airlines\u2019 Boeing 737 MAX 9\naircraft tore off while it was cruising at 16,000 feet.\n\nThe FAA subsequently grounded 171 of the company's MAX 9 aircrafts for review.\nIt has also prohibited the company from increasing production of the MAX\nseries aircraft, and has ordered it to develop a comprehensive plan to address\n\"systemic quality-control issues\".\n\nThe Department of Justice has launched a criminal investigation into the\nAlaska Airlines incident. The investigation will centre on whether Boeing\ncomplied with a 2021 settlement it agreed to after a pair of deadly crashes\nthat were attributed to faults in its 737 MAX Maneuvering Characterists\nAugmentation System, Forbes reports.\n\n## Join our commenting forum\n\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see\ntheir replies\n\nComments\n\n### 1/2Engine part falls off Southwest Airlines\u2019 Boeing plane during takeoff\n\n### Engine part falls off Southwest Airlines\u2019 Boeing plane during takeoff\n\nThe engine cover on a Southwest-operated Boeing aircraft detaches as it leaves\nDenver International Airport on 7 April, 2024\n\n@SweeneyABC/X/Twitter\n\n### Engine part falls off Southwest Airlines\u2019 Boeing plane during takeoff\n\nThe engine part on the Southwest-operated Boeing aircraft detaches as it\nleaves Denver International Airport on 7 April, 2024\n\n@SweeneyABC/X/Twitter\n\n### Subscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference\nlater?
