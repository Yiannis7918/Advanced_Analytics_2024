What can we do about\nthat?Honestly I'd be up for a small sponsorship sum if I could then rest\nassured that roam will work consistently, as I base many of my daily workflows\non it...  \n---  \nThe text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered:  \n  \nContributor\n\n###\n\njmay commented Aug 10, 2023\n\nI'm concerned too. It might be as much a time issue as a sponsorship/money\nissue. How can we help? @jethrokuan @zaeph @progfolio what support do you\nneed?  \n---  \n  \nMember\n\n###\n\nprogfolio commented Aug 10, 2023 \u2022\n\nI stopped using org-roam quite some time ago because it became much more than\nwhat I needed/wanted out of such a system. I currently use a private package\nI've authored which is much simpler, but suits my needs. I'm also busy\nmaintaining Elpaca and straight.el. I appreciate the gesture, but I wouldn't\nbe the right person for the job.  \n---  \n  \nMember\n\n###\n\njethrokuan commented Aug 12, 2023\n\nIt's most certainly just a time issue, and has nothing to do with sponsorship\nand money. I also no longer have a personal laptop, making any bugfixes near\nimpossible. I want to address this, but i'll be preoccupied until at least mid\nSeptember. There are 2 alternate options here:\n\n  1. A successor for the project is found, who would do a better job at maintaining the project. If this option is chosen, I would like to find someone who shares my vision for Org-roam and keep it lean.\n  2. Org-roam is forked and maintained by a separate maintainer.\n\n  \n---  \n  \nContributor\n\n###\n\njmay commented Aug 14, 2023\n\n@jethrokuan I have time, interest and (most of the) technical skills to help\nout with org-roam. Clearing issues, verifying bug reports, clearing PRs, etc.\nI agree with your focus on keeping org-roam lean.But I'd rather not take over\nas sole maintainer - for a project like this there should be multiple brains\ninvolved. Please consider if you're willing to allow extra people to merge PRs\nand how to do so safely.  \n---  \n  \nContributor\n\n###\n\nreal-or-random commented Aug 16, 2023\n\n@jethrokuan:\n\n> i'll be preoccupied until at least mid September.\n\n@jmay:\n\n> But I'd rather not take over as sole maintainer\n\nWould it be acceptable for both of you to get @jmay now to help out, with the\nperspective of @jethrokuan joining forces again later this year? @jmay could\nbegin with a focus on fixing bugs, which would help him get a good start\nfeeling and finding into the role without the need to make fundamental design\ndecisions on day one.  \n---  \n  \nContributor\n\n###\n\nreal-or-random commented Sep 15, 2023\n\n> Would it be acceptable for both of you to get @jmay now to help out, with\n> the perspective of @jethrokuan joining forces again later this year?\n\n@jethrokuan Friendly ping. :) It would be great to hear your thoughts on this.  \n---  \n  \nMember\n\n###\n\nzaeph commented Sep 19, 2023\n\nHi,Sorry for the lack of news until now. I\u2019m settling in a new job, and I\ncould pick up the flame again in early October. I\u2019d need to familiarize myself\nwith the design changes @jethrokuan introduced in v2, but I\u2019m confident I\ncould pick things up quickly.I don\u2019t think the current state of the repo is so\ndire as to require immediate action, but I appreciate your volunteering,\n@jmay.I\u2019ll update here once I\u2019m ready.  \n---  \n  \nMember\n\n###\n\njethrokuan commented Sep 22, 2023\n\nThanks @zaeph , happy to walk you through the main themes.  \n---  \n  \n###\n\nbenley commented Oct 13, 2023\n\n@jethrokuan:\n\n> I also no longer have a personal laptop, making any bugfixes near\n> impossible.

I don't mean to presume anything about your life, but\nthis could be a straightforward way for us to offer support to the project.  \n---  \n  \n###\n\nrudolf-adamkovic commented Nov 1, 2023\n\nHow about merging Org Roam into Org, now that version 2 is lean and Emacs\nships with SQLite out of the box? The project might get more love on the\nmailing list and get better integrated with Org. For example, the tests can\nrun together with Org tests, and so on.  \n---  \n  \nMember\n\n###\n\nprogfolio commented Nov 1, 2023\n\n> How about merging Org Roam into Org, now that version 2 is lean and Emacs\n> ships with SQLite out of the box?

An effort in this direction has been moving many of the\nrepositories that were in \"org-contrib\" into their own separately maintained\nrepositories.  \n---  \n  \n###\n\nrudolf-adamkovic commented Nov 2, 2023\n\n@progfolioI see where you are coming from, but I also think that Org Roam,\nstripped to its core, is fundamental to note taking.  \n---  \n  \nreal-or-random mentioned this issue Nov 2, 2023\n\n(feat)capture: add customizable defaults for deleting aborted files #2351\n\nOpen\n\n###\n\nyantar92 commented Nov 2, 2023 via email\n\nNicholas Vollmer ***@***.***> writes:Org should aim to become leaner, not take\non the maintenance burden of its many extensions.

There are likely parts of\norg-roam that could be useful for Org in general. For example, roam capture\ntemplates that allow creating notes in individual files - this would be a\nnatural addition to the existing org-capture functionality. On the other hand,\nthe whole org-roam is not something that should be added because it will\nincrease the existing maintenance burden - Org already has many non-trivial\nparts and a limited number of maintainers....\\-- Ihor Radchenko // yantar92,\nOrg mode contributor, Learn more about Org mode at <https://orgmode.org/>.\nSupport Org development at <https://liberapay.com/org-mode>, or support my\nwork at <https://liberapay.com/yantar92>  \n---  \n  \nContributor\n\n###\n\nPRESFIL commented Dec 10, 2023\n\nAny updates on this?  \n---  \n  \nContributor\n\n###\n\nbenthamite commented Jan 15, 2024 \u2022\n\nReading this thread, it looks like (1) Jason (@jmay) is willing to become a\nmaintainer provided he is not the sole maintainer, (2) Leo (@zaeph) is willing\nto resume work as a maintainer once he familiarizes himself with v2, and (3)\nJethro (@jethrokuan) is willing to walk Leo through the relevant v2 changes.\nSo maybe a way forward is for Jason, Leo and Jethro to start a conversation to\ncoordinate things?Unfortunately, I lack the technical skills to be of any use,\nbut if money (rather than time or motivation) is an impediment, I\u2019d be more\nthan happy to contribute.  \n---  \n  \n###\n\nDelapouite commented Jan 15, 2024\n\n@nobiot would also be a wonderful addition to the team  \n---  \n  \n###\n\nRecentlyRezzed commented Jan 30, 2024\n\nMy current main concern is the looming incompatibility of Org-roam with Org\nMode 9.7.

I thought the problem described in #2361 , #2381 and #2384 was\ndue to some changes that also broke org-ql and therefore the solution was to\npin Org Mode to a previous version as it is mentioned in some of the comments.\nBut the solution is to use a more current version of straight.I am sorry for\nthe inconvenience.  \n---  \n  \n###\n\nn-hebert commented Mar 16, 2024\n\nI see @jethrokuan is still merging PR's as of Jan, 2024 but there's a bit of a\nvacuum on this thread for clear maintainership direction.Can we get a status\nupdate from @jethrokuan or Jethro's nominated successor on the successor\nstatus?  \n---  \n  \nMember\n\n###\n\nzaeph commented Mar 16, 2024\n\nYou don\u2019t need to worry about maintenance because we still have 1) plenty of\nexpertise to go around, and 2) access to the repo.
