I went to\ndo something else, and when I looked back it wasn\u2019t the Apple TV aerial\nscreensaver, but a YouTube app \u201cscreen saver\u201d with a slideshow of heavily\ncompressed still images.\n\nThe Apple TV in my living room had an older version of the YouTube app\n(presumably from April 2nd if the dates in the version names are to be\nbelieved.) That version didn\u2019t try to override my screensaver like the one in\nmy office.\n\nIt seems the YouTube app, if the app is open, will start a screensaver\nslideshow of generic still images taken from videos if there isn\u2019t a video\nthat I\u2019ve paused.\n\nLook at the compression shred this still.\n\nIf there is a paused video it will be a slideshow of the YouTube thumbnail art\nendlessly zooming in, fading to black, and starting over.\n\nSome of the worst sins of mankind exist in YouTube thumbnails, and they\u2019re not\ndesigned to be screensavers.\n\nYou know what is designed to be a screensaver? The Apple TV\u2019s aerial\nscreensaver. Far and away the most lauded feature of the Apple TV platform.\nBeloved by all (except people that get creeped out by jellyfish) and yet\nreplaced by either chunky-compressed stills from drone footage, or looping\nthumbnails.\n\nTo top it all off, it has static, white text (famously the best to use for\nscreensavers) for video details, static YouTube logo, and a graphic for the\ndirectional pad, indicating that pressing the top will start playing the video\nbeing used in the screensaver. If you have an older Apple TV in your house (my\noffice Apple TV is the 4th gen one) with the awful touchpad you can even\ntrigger it when you try and pick up the remote from the furniture.\n\nYouTube\u2019s not the first company to \u201cinnovate\u201d in the screensaver space, and\nit\u2019s not exclusive to the Apple TV. A few years ago my boyfriend had a set-top\nbox that would initial start a slideshow of ugly nature photos, and then after\na while they started dropping in ads into the slideshow.\n\nI fully expect YouTube\u2019s aim here is to capitalize on all this \u201cfree\u201d real\nestate and start sliding in ads, promoting specific videos from partners, or\nshowcasing movies available to rent or buy. I know that\u2019s cynical, but so is\nYouTube as a business.\n\nSetting that aside, I pay for YouTube Premium because the ads are so awful I\ncan\u2019t stand them, but because there\u2019s some pretense of this being a\nscreensaver I still get these slideshows that are the future home of ads for\nother people.\n\nOn April 4th, Janko Roettgers published a piece about a recent Roku patent\nfiling about injecting ads over the source input feed when the source input\nfeed is paused. The patent also says the display device will discern content\nand context to place a relevant ad over the paused video stream.\n\nAs Janko points out, Roku already monetizes screensavers on its platform. Feel\nfree to peruse Roku\u2019s site where they brag about chunks of the screen they\u2019re\nwilling to sell.\n\nI don\u2019t think advertising, in the abstract, is evil. I do, however, think it\u2019s\ninsidious to inject advertising into every pore \u2014especially when those pores\ndon\u2019t belong to you, like when you\u2019re the YouTube app, not even a platform.\n\n## Screen Saved\n\nIf you want to bypass the YouTube app change, I heard from Rob Bhalla on\nMastodon that if you change the screensaver to start at 2 minutes, instead of\nthe Apple TV\u2019s default 5 minutes, then the Apple TV\u2019s screensaver kicks in\nbefore the YouTube one and you never see theirs. Thanks to YouTube not having\nany screensaver controls, and no idea what your actual screensaver settings on\nthe Apple TV are, they hard coded in a start time just prior to the default 5\nminutes.\n\nThat\u2019s how you know it\u2019s really there to help improve user experience, and not\njust a craven money grab by absolute hacks.\n\nSure, they might change this to start even earlier. In which case, we\u2019re at\nthe mercy of Apple to protect customer experience. I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath\non that one. App Store rejections are for indie devs, and people trying to\nskirt giving Apple money, not YouTube overriding the screensaver.\n\n2024-04-12 02:30:00\n\nCategory: text\n\nSubscribe About\n\n", "frontpage": false}
