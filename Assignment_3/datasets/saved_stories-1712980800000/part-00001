They famously\naccused Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg of stealing the idea for his site\nfrom them when they were all at Harvard together.\n\nFollowing a lengthy lawsuit, eventually the twins received a settlement that\nincluded a whopping $20m (\u00a316m) in cash and shares in the company.\n\nYou might remember it all playing out in the 2010 Oscar-winning film The\nSocial Network. Well, since then the pair have been carrying the flag for\ncryptocurrencies, and are two of the world\u2019s first well-known Bitcoin\nbillionaires.\n\nNot only do Tyler and Cameron own an enormous number of Bitcoins, they also\nbuilt a crypto exchange called Gemini which is, essentially, a stock exchange\nfor crypto coins.\n\nBut that endeavour hasn\u2019t been plain sailing, either; just this year they were\nordered to return more than $1bn (\u00a3800m) to customers due to a defunct lending\nprogramme and pay a large fine for unsafe and unsound practices.\n\nIt\u2019ll be interesting to see how their fortunes fare when it comes to football\nbut it\u2019s really not a bad time for Bitcoin right now. Its value has risen to\nan all-time high in recent weeks.\n\n## 'Investing in a dream'\n\nGemini started its sponsorship of the club in January 2022.\n\nThe investment will be used for the development of a new training centre, the\nlaunch of a football academy for new talent and to continue supporting girls\nand youth football.\n\nThe club said the funds would also be used to establish \"a Bitcoin treasury to\nsecure the club\u2019s long-term ambitions\".\n\nTyler Winklevoss said he was excited to work alongside Mr McCormack as a co-\nowner.\n\n\u201cWe share in Peter\u2019s deep conviction in Bitcoin and its ability to supercharge\nRBFC\u2019s quest to make it into the Premier League,\" he said.\n\nHis brother added: \"We\u2019re not just investing in a football club. We\u2019re\ninvesting in a dream to bring Premier League football to Bedford.\"\n\nRBFC currently sit at the top of the Spartan South Midlands Football League\nPremier Division.\n\nMr McCormack said: \"The backing from Tyler and Cameron will allow us to\ncontinue investing in Bedford and the local community.\"\n\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.
