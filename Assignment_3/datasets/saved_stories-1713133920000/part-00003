Prove them wrong \ud83d\ude24\n\n  * \u201cYou have to have a PhD and have written bunch of famous papers to get the O-1.\u201d\n  * \u201cIt\u2019s known as the Einstein VISA dude. That means you have to be like Einstein to get the VISA\u201d\n  * \u201cI heard Melania Trump got the VISA for being a Playboy Bunny. Meanwhile, I\u2019m just a software engineer\u201d\n  * \u201cYou are smart but you aren\u2019t O-1 smart dude\u201d\n  * \u201cO-1 is literally called a VISA for Individuals with Extraordinary Ability or Achievement. Are you that extraordinary?\u201d\n\nI am here to tell you that, according to the eyes of the US government, you\nare probably more extraordinary than you think.\n\nAbove are some quotes and pre-conceptions I collected from my immigrant\nfriends when I asked them about the O-1. Before I got my own O-1, I thought\nall the above facts were true. When I had to leave the US because I didn\u2019t get\npicked for the H-1B, I didn\u2019t even think that the O-1 was a valid option for\nme. The law abiding citizen I am, I moved all my furniture into a storage\nunit, said goodbye to my friends, and hopped across the pond to started a new\nlife in the UK.\n\nPicture I took when I moved into my new flat in Stoke Newington. In my head, I\nwas thinking 'So, what now?'\n\nBefore I moved, I wish someone could of told me \u201cHey Mike, O-1 is not an\nimpossible VISA to get. You should talk to a lawyer about it.\u201d Well... since\nthat didn\u2019t happen, this is me doing the next best thing; writing this post in\nhopes that it will help at least one immigrant soul out there that is\nconcerned about their future in the US. In this post, I will attempt to bust\nmyths about O-1 in hopes that more people will become aware about it. I will\nalso try to write about things I wish I had known earlier in my immigration\njourney.\n\n> Note: I am not a lawyer. I am a software engineer by profession. Please take\n> all the statements in this essay with a grain of salt and confirm them with\n> an actual lawyer.\n\n### My Story\n\nMy story as a foreign alien in the US is extremely long - I think it deserves\nan entirely separate blog post. But for now, I will tell you the story of how\nI found myself in London in a position where I thought I didn\u2019t have a ticket\nback to the US, and how I stumbled across the O-1 VISA and eventually made my\nway back to the US, where I had lived for about 10+ years.\n\n  * I first came to the states with my parents when I was a 3rd grader. We left after one year. (J-1)\n  * I came back for middle school and stayed until college (F-1)\n  * I got internships and jobs out of college in the tech industry (F-1 STEM OPT)\n  * Didn\u2019t get the H-1B after 3 tries and had to leave the US and move to the UK\n  * Started a new life in London, UK (Skilled Worker VISA sponsored by Twitter)\n\nTo paint the picture, when I came to London, I didn\u2019t have a good plan on how\nI could come back to the US. The only viable option that I knew of at the time\nwas the L-1 VISA. I also knew that the L-1 is extremely restrictive and is\nsomething I didn\u2019t want to apply for unless there was a gun to my head.\n\nThe trajectory of my immigration journey changed when I was scrolling on\nTwitter and saw this tweet. I became curious and decided to talk to Logan. In\nmy mind, the worst thing that could\u2019ve happened is me blowing $200.\nThankfully, after talking to Logan, it seemed like I had a good chance for the\nO-1. The next couple months flew by but at the end of the day...\n\n> I applied for the O-1 and came back to the states (took 2 months total)\n> tl;dr I am neither Einstein nor a famous celebrity... yet, I still managed\n> to get the O-1.\n\nOk, now with that out of the way, let\u2019s get onto the main content. The rest of\nthis post will follow the form of question and answer. These questions have\nbeen collected from fellow immigrants friends.\n\n### Q. I thought only PhDs qualify for the O-1?\n\nHaving a PhD and having written notable papers in your industry definitely\nhelps you get the O-1. However, this is not a strict requirement. I personally\nonly have an undergraduate degree from a public university and have not\npublished any papers.\n\n### Q. Do I qualify for the O-1?\n\nThere are 8 requirements and according to the US government, you must meet at\nleast 3. I encourage you to read through the requirements and objectively try\nto see if you qualify. If you meet 2-3 requirements, I would recommend that\nyou talk to a lawyer and ask for their opinion. If you don\u2019t meet 2-3, it\u2019s\nnot the end of the world. You probably know your industry better than I do but\nif you look hard enough, I would bet there are opportunities out there that\nwill help you check one or two more boxes. Here is a tweet from Logan who does\na great job of explaining each qualification and what is expected from each\none of them.\n\nIf you have any doubts or even slightly curious, I HIGHLY encourage you to\nconsult a lawyer about this. Prep your CV, write down stuff you have done in\nthe past that you think is even remotely impressive and tell a lawyer about\nit. It will cost about $200 but personally, that $200 changed the trajectory\nof my life.\n\n### Q: How much does it cost?\n\nDepending on the lawyer, $8k ~ $15k. Why is the range so wide? I don\u2019t have a\nperfect answer for that but I will leave you with this thought. You get what\nyou paid for and is your immigration status something you are trying to cheap\nout on? I will let you answer that question for yourself.\n\nI personally paid $13k. Rough break down is\n\n  * $3k (premium VISA processing + application fee)\n  * $10k (lawyer fees)\n\n### Q. How long does it take?\n\nThis is completely up to you and the company you are working with. However, if\nyou have all the paperwork and supporting documents that will help the lawyer\ndo their job, it should take 1-2 months to form a case and a story for your\napplication. Once your application is submitted, the timeline after that is\ncompletely dependent on the following factors.\n\n  * Country you are in (US embassies of certain countries are busier than others)\n  * Time of year (US embassies are busier couple months before school starts)\n  * Your previous VISA history (depending on your VISA history & your nationality, you might be able to skip the interview process)\n\nFor me, it took about one month until I had the passport in my hand.\n\n### Q. What\u2019s the acceptance rate?\n\nAccording to Google, it\u2019s around 80~95%. I asked some lawyers in the field and\nthey gave me similar numbers. You may ask, \u201cWhat?! How is it so high?\u201d We will\nnever know but I have some educated guesses.\n\n  1. A lot of people think they aren\u2019t \u201cexceptional\u201d enough for the O-1\n  2. Not a lot of people even think the O-1 is an option for them\n  3. Hiring and talking to lawyers is a huge barrier\n  4. Cost of application + lawyer is high\n\n### So... what do you think?\n\nThe moment I passed border security with my O-1. The bliss \u2728\n\nIf you read this far, I hope you are thinking about talking to a lawyer to see\nif the O-1 makes sense for you. It\u2019s a tough, anxiety ridden process but if\ncoming to the US is something you want to achieve, I promise you it will be\nworth it.
