However, creating sustainable,\nequitable long term care systems remains a problem to be solved.\n\nSavyasachee Jha\n\nApr 13, 2024\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Long term care insurance as public policy\n\nwww.hawkradius.com\n\nShare\n\nLTCI: By Stable Diffusion XL\n\nThe rising number of elderly in the world brings forth a set of problems which\nwere unanticipated ere the dawn of the modern era. Bismarck, when he created\nthe forerunner to the modern welfare state, did not imagine it needing to take\ncare of a large number of people in their 70s and 80s. Yet here we are, living\nin a world in which people routinely live to their mid to late 80s.\n\nThis would traditionally not be seen as a problem. Having ancestors live long\nhas historically had multiple advantages. However, with decreasing birth rates\nand increasingly high standards of living, some parts of the world have been\ncontending with the surprising fact that taking care of elders is not exactly\nan easy thing to do.\n\nThe Netherlands was the first country to introduce mandatory universal social\ninsurance scheme which provided long term care services in a variety of\nsettings. Germany was the first country to do implement long term care\ninsurance (LTCI) in the form of social legislation in 1995. It has gone on to\nbecome the fifth pillar insurance after endowment insurance, medical\ninsurance, accidental injury insurance, and unemployment insurance. The United\nStates has also gone on to formally enact public LTCI.\n\nThanks for reading Hawk Radius!

With a birth rate\nbelow replacement for the longest time, the country has been dealing with\nepidemics of loneliness and single elders having no one to care about them.\nJapan's post service actually provides a service in which children living away\nfrom their parents can get a postman to visit and take stock of the situation\nat home.\n\nThe solution was a national policy response to this problem since the year\n2000. Japan has public LTCI designed to provide long-term care services to\nresidents based on their individual care needs.\n\nThe Long-Term Care Insurance Act in Japan categorizes long-term care services\ninto three main types:\n\n1\\. In-home care services: These include various services such as visiting,\ncommuting, short-stay, and others that are provided at the individual's home.\n\n2\\. Nursing-home care services: These are provided by welfare, health, and\nmedical facilities for the elderly who require more intensive care.\n\n3\\. Community-based care services: This category includes visiting, commuting,\nnursing-home, and composite services that are designed to support the elderly\nwithin their communities.\n\nThe primary candidates for LTCI are residents aged 65 years and above.\nAdditionally, residents aged 40 to 64 years who require care due to specific\nconditions are also eligible. The requirements are divided into seven care\nlevels (support levels 1 & 2, which do not qualify for nursing home service,\nand care-need levels 1 to 5, which qualify for nursing home service).\n\nThe classification is initially done based on the number of care minutes\nrequired per day to care for the person. The final care-need level is\ndetermined by the Nursing Care Needs Certification Board, which consists of\nphysicians, nurses, and other experts in health and social services appointed\nby the mayor. The board takes into consideration the notes provided by the\nassessing officer and the statement from the primary care physician when\nmaking their decision. Once the care-need level is assigned, it remains valid\nfor a period ranging from six months to two years. Typically, the care-need\nlevel is re-evaluated once or twice annually to ensure that the individual\nreceives the appropriate level of care based on their current needs.\n\nThe LTCI law in Japan makes sure that the insured only pays 10% of the costs\nout of pocket. Out of the remainder, half is borne by the government's\ninsurance policy into which the insured pays a premium, and the other half is\npaid for by the government.\n\n###\n\nSouth Korea's LTCI programme\n\nSouth Korea's population is also aging rapidly, with the proportion of people\naged 65 or older expected to reach one-third of the population by 2050.\nAlongside this, social changes such as increased female participation in the\nlabour market, a rise in the number of elderly living alone, and increased\npublic demand for governmental responsibility in caring for the elderly have\nbegun exerting their demands on Korean society.\n\nIn response, the Korean government introduced the public LTCI program in July\n2008, aiming to provide in-kind benefits for daily and social life activities\nfor the elderly, either at home or in LTC institutions. Benefits are made\navailable to individuals aged 65 and older, as well as those under 65 with\ndebilitating conditions, subject to an eligibility test conducted through a\nnational care need-assessment system. The system is very similar to Japan's.\n\nResearch has found that the most likely users of this programme were\ntraditionally underserved people such as the elderly, women, people who live\nalone, and people living in rural areas. The programme is also effective:\npeople in the programme have lower out of pocket costs across the board as\ncompared to those who do not and most of them come close to maxing out their\nmonthly benefit limit.\n\n###\n\nChina's public LTCI programme\n\nAnother country to launch an LTCI programme was China, where the one-child\npolicy has led to a fairly large skew in the demographics towards the elderly.\nWhile the primary caregivers in Chinese society have always been immediate\nfamily, with each married couple often needing to care for two sets of parents\nand four sets of grandparents, institutionalised policy needed to be made to\nplug this gap.\n\nChina launched its first pilot LTCI program in 2016, covering 15 cities. In\n2020, the central government expanded the pilot projects to an additional 34\ncities, bringing the total number of pilot cities to 49. Despite these\nefforts, challenges remain, such as the lack of community and home-based care\nservices, the need to expand insurance coverage, and the importance of\ndiversifying funding sources.\n\nHowever, there was no central authority governing these plans in China.\nGuidance provided by Beijing was only that: guidance. Every province had\nautonomy in creating and enforcing its own LTCI programme. So for example,\nwhile the guidance recommended a reimbursement rate of 70% for LTCI, this\nvaried wildly across the various provinces where the programme was\noperationalised. Programmes in most provinces are designed to alleviate both\nfinancial and caregiving burdens faced by families, but are varyingly\nsuccessful in either dimension.\n\n##\n\nIs public LTCI the answer to taking care of the elderly?\n\nThere are significant upsides to having public LTCI. The physical health of\nthose covered by good public LTCI has been seen to show a marked improvement\nover comparable cohorts elsewhere, especially if they have received good home\ncare. There is also a significant increase in financial security amongst those\ntaking advantage of these programmes. A small positive effect on the labour\nmarket has also been noticed, likely due to caregivers having more time to\nspend in economically productive endeavours.\n\nHowever, there some significant downsides too. The presence of LTCI in a\ncountry increases the use of institutional healthcare and the intensity of LTC\nsought. In other words, if you give people a benefit, people will use it\nregardless of whether they require it or not. The Korean system, for example,\nhas no gatekeeping or care management system. As long as the beneficiaries can\nafford the (relatively small) co-payment, they can choose whether they would\nprefer institutional or home-based care leading to increasing strain on the\nhealth system.\n\nChina is also facing a similar problem. Although its LTCI programmes have led\nto a reduction in \"social hospitalisation\", which is a trend of seeking in-\npatient care for minor ailments to substitute for long-term care, the growth\nof institutional care over home-based or community-based care has been seen in\nall provinces. The programmes also do not address the needs, preferences and\nvalues of older people and also have spotty coverage in rural areas.\n\nImplementation of such programmes in low-income countries such as India and\nThailand would require careful thought about mitigating these issues. While\nthe benefits are many, the major challenges are resource utilisation and\nsustainable funding. These countries have few public resources to spare, and\nlegislating something like a LTCI would require major restructuring of the\nhealthcare system. Financing such an endeavour is something with which\ncountries such as Germany and Japan have grappled for years, with both\ncountries increasing contribution rates and creating a public \"population\nreserve fund\". It would be difficult to say what such a system would look like\nin, say, India.\n\nEnsuring coordination between the LTCI sector and tertiary healthcare would be\nanother stumbling block. While India in particular has a good track record in\ncertain health verticals (the national TB elimination mission, the Pulse Polio\nprogramme etc.), their integration with the wider healthcare system is spotty\nat best. These systems also clash with traditional ways of thinking about the\nelderly in these countries: Korea has faced heavy challenges with deeply\nembedded familialism in the society. There is no reason to think the same\nwould not be true of countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, India, etc.\n\nHowever, the biggest challenge would be countering fraud in such a system.\nPublic systems have a way of turning into rent-seeking structures in many low\nand middle income countries (LMICs). The cannibalisation of limited resources\nby those who may not need them purely for the motive of seeking rent is quite\ncommon across LMICs: a public LTCI would be very vulnerable to it.\n\nA solution might be to utilise digital identities to minimise theft and rent-\nseeking. It may not be 100% there, but it may go a certain distance in\nreducing fraud and increasing efficiency, especially in India, where the India\nStack has the potential to allow for more transparent and quicker checking of\nidentities, and combined with the one's abha number, may allow for quicker and\nmore direct referrals to LTC institutions and/or for the provision of home\ncare. A focus on home care over institutional care might be another way for\nLMICs to go forward.\n\nThanks for reading Hawk Radius!
