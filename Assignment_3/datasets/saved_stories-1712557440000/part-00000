Are you an \u201cinbox zero\u201d kind of person, or do\nyou just leave thousands of them unread?\n\nOur new study, published today in the journal Information Research, suggests\nthat leaving all your emails in the inbox is likely to leave you dissatisfied\nwith your personal records management.\n\nIn an exploratory survey, we asked participants how they dealt with their\npersonal records such as bills, online subscriptions and similar items. Many\nof these arrive by email.\n\nWe found that most respondents left their electronic records in their email.\nOnly half saved items such as bills and other documents to other locations,\nlike their computer or the cloud. But having a disorganised inbox also led to\nproblems, including missing bills and losing track of important\ncorrespondence.\n\n## The risk of losing track of your emails\n\nReceiving bills, insurance renewals and other household documents by email\nsaves time and money, and reduces unnecessary paper use.\n\nHowever, there are risks involved if you don\u2019t stay on top of your electronic\nrecords. Respondents in our research reported issues such as lapsed vehicle\nregistration, failing to cancel unwanted subscriptions, and overlooking tax\ndeductions because it was too much trouble finding the receipts.\n\nThis suggests late fines and other email oversights could be costing people\nhundreds of dollars each year.\n\nIn addition to the financial costs, research suggests that not sorting and\nmanaging electronic records makes it more difficult to put together the\ninformation needed at tax time, or for other high-stakes situations, such as\nloan applications.\n\nRead more: Why do I get so much spam and unwanted email in my inbox? And how\ncan I get rid of it?\n\n## What did we find?\n\nWe surveyed over 300 diverse respondents on their personal electronic records\nmanagement. Most of them were from Australia, but we also received responses\nfrom other countries, such as the United Kingdom, United States, Switzerland,\nPortugal and elsewhere.\n\nTwo-thirds of the respondents used their email to manage personal records,\nsuch as bills, receipts, subscriptions and more. Of those, we found that once\nrespondents had dealt with their email, about half of them would sort the\nemails into folders, while the other half would leave everything in the inbox.\n\nWhile most sorted their workplace email into folders, they were much less\nlikely to sort their personal email in the same way.\n\nThe results also showed that only half (52%) of respondents who left all their\nemail in the inbox were satisfied with their records management, compared to\n71% of respondents who sorted their email into folders.\n\nOf the respondents who saved their paperwork in the cloud (Google Drive,\niCloud, Dropbox and similar), 83% reported being satisfied with their home\nrecords management.\n\nThe study was exploratory, so further research will be needed to see if our\nfindings apply more universally. However, our statistical analysis did reveal\npractices associated with more satisfactory outcomes, and ones that might be\nbetter to avoid.\n\nLeaving all your emails in your inbox might be an effort-free approach, but it\ncan come back to bite you later.

For example, a\nbill that needs to be paid could slip down the line unnoticed, drowned by\nother emails.\n\nSecond, relying on search to re-find emails means you need to know exactly\nwhat you\u2019re looking for. For example, at tax time searching for charity\ndonation receipts depends on remembering what to search for, as well as the\nexact wording in the email containing the receipt.\n\nThird, many bills and statements are not sent as attachments to emails, but\nrather as hyperlinks. If you change your bank or another service provider,\nthose hyperlinks may not be accessible at a later date. Not being able to\naccess missing payslips from a former employer can also cause issues, as shown\nby the Robodebt scandal or the recent case of the Australian Tax Office\nreviving old debts.\n\nYou can apply a few simple practices to your email management to minimise\nstress and financial losses. kpatyhka/Shutterstock\n\n## 4 tips for better records management\n\nWhen we asked respondents to nominate a preferred location for keeping their\npersonal records, they tended to choose a more organised format than their\ncurrent behaviour. Ideally, only 8% of the respondents would leave everything\nin their email inbox, unsorted.\n\nOur findings suggest a set of practices that can help you get on top of your\nelectronic records and prevent stress or financial losses:\n\n  * sort your email into category folders, or save records in folders in the cloud or on a computer\n\n  * download documents that are not attached to emails or sent to you \u2013 such as utility bills and all your payslips\n\n  * put important renewals in your calendar as reminders, and\n\n  * delete junk mail and unsubscribe, so that your inbox can be turned into a to-do list.\n\nRead more: Do you answer emails outside work hours?
