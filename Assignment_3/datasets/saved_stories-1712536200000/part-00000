The survey of how people now move in Paris was\nconducted with GPS trackers by academics from L\u2019Institut Paris R\u00e9gion, the\nlargest urban planning and environmental agency in Europe.\n\nThe institute\u2019s transportation report was published on April 4. It found that\nthe way Parisians are now traveling from the suburbs to the city center,\nespecially during peak periods, has undergone a revolution thanks in part to\nthe building of many miles of cycleways.\n\nThose cyclists now on the streets and roads of central Paris are not Spandex-\nclad professionals as seen on the Tour de France but everyday transportation\ncyclists.\n\nL\u2019Institut Paris R\u00e9gion carried out the survey for a consortium of fourteen\npublic and private partners, including local government and rail companies.\n\nReporting on the institute\u2019s survey, French TV channel 20 Minutes told viewers\nthat the \u201ccapital\u2019s cycle paths are always full.\u201d\n\nMORE FROM FORBESParis Votes To Triple Parking Charges For SUVsBy Carlton Reid\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\n### WWE WrestleMania 40 Results Winners And Grades From Night 1\n\n### WWE WrestleMania 40 Results And Everything That Happened As The Rock Pins\nCody\n\n### WWE WrestleMania 40 Results As Jey Uso Defeats Jimmy Uso\n\nBetween October 2022 and April 2023, 3,337 Parisians aged 16 to 80 years old\nwere equipped with GPS trackers to record their journeys for seven consecutive\ndays. In the suburbs, where public transit is less dense, transport by car was\nfound to be the main form of mobility. But for journeys from the outskirts of\nParis to the center, the number of cyclists now far exceeds the number of\nmotorists, a huge change from just five years ago. Most of the journeys\nrecorded were commuter trips.\n\nThe city\u2019s socialist mayor Anne Hidalgo has pushed through a great many anti-\nmotoring measures during her two administrations\u2014such as reducing the number\nof parking places, restricting access by SUVs, and closing some major roads to\nmotorists\u2014and the latest survey will be validation for her policies, none of\nwhich have caused the kind of protests that the French capital has long been\nfamous for.\n\nIn short, culling cars has been far more popular than her petrolhead critics\npredicted, with Paris becoming cleaner and healthier to boot.\n\nNotably, and without the spread of conspiracy theories common outside of\nFrance, Paris is also putting into practice the home-grown concept of the\n\u201c15-minute city,\u201d creating urban areas where access to amenities is close and\nhence there\u2019s less need to drive.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.
