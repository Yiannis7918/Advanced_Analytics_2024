(DARPA via AP)\n\nBy FRANK BAJAK\n\nUpdated 9:44 AM UTC, April 12, 2024\n\nShare\n\n  * Copy\n\nLink copied\n\n  * Email\n\n  * Facebook\n\n  * X\n\n  * Reddit\n\n  * LinkedIn\n\n  * Pinterest\n\n  * Flipboard\n\n  * Print\n\nAs their rivalry intensifies, U.S. and Chinese military planners are gearing\nup for a new kind of warfare in which squadrons of air and sea drones equipped\nwith artificial intelligence work together like a swarm of bees to overwhelm\nan enemy.\n\nThe planners envision a scenario in which hundreds, even thousands of the\nmachines engage in coordinated battle. A single controller might oversee\ndozens of drones. Some would scout, others attack. Some would be able to pivot\nto new objectives in the middle of a mission based on prior programming rather\nthan a direct order.\n\nThe world\u2019s only AI superpowers are engaged in an arms race for swarming\ndrones that is reminiscent of the Cold War, except drone technology will be\nfar more difficult to contain than nuclear weapons. Because software drives\nthe drones\u2019 swarming abilities, it could be relatively easy and cheap for\nrogue nations and militants to acquire their own fleets of killer robots.\n\nThe Pentagon is pushing urgent development of inexpensive, expendable drones\nas a deterrent against China acting on its territorial claim on Taiwan.\nWashington says it has no choice but to keep pace with Beijing. Chinese\nofficials say AI-enabled weapons are inevitable so they, too, must have them.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nAI-operated fighter jet will fly Air Force secretary in a test of military\u2019s\nfuture drone warplanes\n\nUN atomic watchdog says the status of Russian-occupied Ukraine nuclear plant\nis \u2018extremely serious\u2019\n\nAttacks on Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant significantly increase accident risk,\nIAEA head says\n\nThe unchecked spread of swarm technology \u201ccould lead to more instability and\nconflict around the world,\u201d said Margarita Konaev, an analyst with Georgetown\nUniversity\u2019s Center for Security and Emerging Technology.\n\nAs the undisputed leaders in the field, Washington and Beijing are best\nequipped to set an example by putting limits on military uses of drone swarms.\nBut their intense competition, China\u2019s military aggression in the South China\nSea and persistent tensions over Taiwan make the prospect of cooperation look\ndim.\n\nThe idea is not new. The United Nations has tried for more than a decade to\nadvance drone non-proliferation efforts that could include limits such as\nforbidding the targeting of civilians or banning the use of swarms for ethnic\ncleansing.\n\n## MILITARY CONTRACTS OFFER CLUES\n\nDrones have been a priority for both powers for years, and each side has kept\nits advances secret, so it\u2019s unclear which country might have an edge.\n\nA 2023 Georgetown study of AI-related military spending found that more than a\nthird of known contracts issued by both U.S. and Chinese military services\nover eight months in 2020 were for intelligent uncrewed systems.\n\nThe Pentagon sought bids in January for small, unmanned maritime\n\u201cinterceptors.\u201d The specifications reflect the military\u2019s ambition: The drones\nmust be able to transit hundreds of miles of \u201ccontested waterspace,\u201d work in\ngroups in waters without GPS, carry 1,000-pound payloads, attack hostile craft\nat 40 mph and execute \u201ccomplex autonomous behaviors\u201d to adapt to a target\u2019s\nevasive tactics.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how many drones a single person would control. A spokesman for\nthe defense secretary declined to say, but a recently published Pentagon-\nbacked study offers a clue: A single operator supervised a swarm of more than\n100 cheap air and land drones in late 2021 in an urban warfare exercise at an\nArmy training site at Fort Campbell, Tennessee.\n\nThe CEO of a company developing software to allow multiple drones to\ncollaborate said in an interview that the technology is bounding ahead.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re enabling a single operator to direct right now half a dozen,\u201d said\nLorenz Meier of Auterion, which is working on the technology for the U.S.\nmilitary and its allies. He said that number is expected to increase to dozens\nand within a year to hundreds.\n\nNot to be outdone, China\u2019s military claimed last year that dozens of aerial\ndrones \u201cself-healed\u201d after jamming cut their communications. An official\ndocumentary said they regrouped, switched to self-guidance and completed a\nsearch-and-destroy mission unaided, detonating explosive-laden drones on a\ntarget.\n\nIn justifying the push for drone swarms, China hawks in Washington offer this\nscenario: Beijing invades Taiwan then stymies U.S. intervention efforts with\nwaves of air and sea drones that deny American and allied planes, ships and\ntroops a foothold.\n\nA year ago, CIA Director William Burns said Chinese Communist Party leader Xi\nJinping had instructed his military to \u201cbe ready by 2027\u201d to invade. But that\ndoesn\u2019t mean an invasion is likely, or that the U.S.-China arms race over AI\nwill not aggravate global instability.\n\n## KISSINGER URGED ACTION\n\nJust before he died last year, former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger\nurged Beijing and Washington to work together to discourage AI arms\nproliferation. They have \u201ca narrow window of opportunity,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cRestraints for AI need to occur before AI is built into the security\nstructure of each society,\u201d Kissinger wrote with Harvard\u2019s Graham Allison.\n\nXi and President Joe Biden made a verbal agreement in November to set up\nworking groups on AI safety, but that effort has so far taken a back seat to\nthe arms race for autonomous drones.\n\nThe competition is not apt to build trust or reduce the risk of conflict, said\nWilliam Hartung, a senior research fellow at the Quincy Institute for\nResponsible Statecraft.\n\nIf the U.S. is \u201cgoing full speed ahead, it\u2019s most likely China will accelerate\nwhatever it\u2019s doing,\u201d Hartung said.\n\nThere\u2019s a risk China could offer swarm technology to U.S. foes or repressive\ncountries, analysts say. Or it could be stolen. Other countries developing the\ntech, such as Russia, Israel, Iran and Turkey, could also spread the know-how.\n\nU.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in January that U.S.-China\ntalks set to begin sometime this spring will address AI safety. Neither the\ndefense secretary\u2019s office nor the National Security Council would comment on\nwhether the military use of drone swarms might be on the agenda.\n\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n## A FIVE-YEAR WAIT\n\nMilitary analysts, drone makers and AI researchers don\u2019t expect fully capable,\ncombat-ready swarms to be fielded for five years or so, though big\nbreakthroughs could happen sooner.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese have an edge in hardware right now. I think we have an edge in\nsoftware,\u201d said CEO Adam Bry of U.S. drone maker Skydio, which supplies the\nArmy, the Drug Enforcement Agency and the State Department, among other\nagencies.\n\nChinese military analyst Song Zhongping said the U.S. has \u201cstronger basic\nscientific and technological capabilities\u201d but added that the American\nadvantage is not \u201cimpossible to surpass.\u201d He said Washington also tends to\noverestimate the effect of its computer chip export restrictions on China\u2019s\ndrone swarm advances.\n\nPaul Scharre, an AI expert at the Center for a New American Security think\ntank, believes the rivals are at rough parity.\n\n\u201cThe bigger question for each country is about how do you use a drone swarm\neffectively?\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s one reason all eyes are on the war in Ukraine, where drones work as\neyes in the sky to make undetected front-line maneuvers all but impossible.\nThey also deliver explosives and serve as sea-skimming ship killers.\n\nDrones in Ukraine are often lost to jamming. Electronic interference is just\none of many challenges for drone swarm development. Researchers are also\nfocused on the difficulty of marshaling hundreds of air and sea drones in\nsemi-autonomous swarms over vast expanses of the western Pacific for a\npotential war over Taiwan.\n\nA secretive, now-inactive $78 million program announced early last year by the\nPentagon\u2019s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, seemed tailor-\nmade for the Taiwan invasion scenario.\n\nThe Autonomous Multi-Domain Adaptive Swarms-of-Swarms is a mouthful to say,\nbut the mission is clear: Develop ways for thousands of autonomous land, sea\nand air drones to \u201cdegrade or defeat\u201d a foe in seizing contested turf.\n\n## DRONES IMPROVISE \u2014 BUT MUST STICK TO ORDERS\n\nA separate DARPA program called OFFensive Swarm-Enabled Tactics, had the goal\nof marshaling upwards of 250 land-based drones to assist Army troops in urban\nwarfare.\n\nProject coordinator Julie Adams, an Oregon State robotics professor, said\nswarm commanders in the exercise managed to choreograph up to 133 ground and\nair vehicles at a time. The drones were programmed with a set of tactics they\ncould perform semi-autonomously, including indoor reconnaissance and simulated\nenemy kills.\n\nUnder the direction of a swarm commander, the fleet acted something like an\ninfantry squad whose soldiers are permitted some improvisation as long as they\nstick to orders.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what I would call supervisory interaction, in that the human could stop\nthe command or stop the tactic,\u201d Adams said. But once a course of action \u2014\nsuch as an attack \u2014 was set in motion, the drone was on its own.\n\nAdams said she was particularly impressed with a swarm commander in a\ndifferent exercise last year at Fort Moore, Georgia, who single-handedly\nmanaged a 45-drone swarm over 2.5 hours with just 20 minutes of training.\n\n\u201cIt was a pleasant surprise,\u201d she said.\n\nA reporter had to ask: Was he a video game player?\n\nYes, she said. \u201cAnd he had a VR headset at home.\u201d\n\n## ___\n\nAssociated Press Writer Zen Soo in Hong Kong contributed to this report.\n\nFRANK BAJAK\n\nBajak is an Associated Press technology reporter who focuses on hacking,\nprivacy, surveillance and military AI.\n\ntwitter\n\nby Taboolaby Taboola\n\nSuggested For You\n\nWas kostet eine Solaranlage mit Speicher 2024?Solaranlagen\n\n:Advertisement:Advertisement\n\nDie Paradiesroute S\u00fcdburgenland \u2013 genussvoll durch die Natur!Urlaub in\n\u00d6sterreich\n\n:Advertisement:Advertisement\n\nDie Installation lohnt sich allein f\u00fcr die GrafikMech Arena - Play For Free on\nPC\n\n:Advertisement:Advertisement\n\nErleichterung in nur 4 Tagen - Warum diese Gummib\u00e4rchen teures Hanf\u00f6l\n\u00fcbertrumpfenSarah's Blessing\n\n:Advertisement:Advertisement\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to\nfactual reporting.
