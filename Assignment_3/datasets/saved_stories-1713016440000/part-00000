It\u2019s the first known case\nof a naturally occurring regular fractal on the molecular level.\n\nFranziska Sendker\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Email\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Pinterest\n  * Pocket\n  * Reddit\n  * Print\n\nBy Emily Conover\n\n16 hours ago\n\nFractals are everywhere in nature, from river deltas to tree branches. These\nstructures look similar from afar as when you zoom in close. Certain fractals,\ncalled regular fractals, are identical on different scales and include whirls\nof Romanesco cauliflower (SN: 7/8/21). But regular fractals hadn\u2019t been\nspotted in nature on the molecular level \u2014 until now.\n\nA protein found in the bacterium Synechococcus elongatus assembles itself into\na fractal called a Sierpi\u0144ski triangle, evolutionary biochemist Georg Hochberg\nand colleagues report April 10 in Nature. When placed in water, the proteins\nlinked up into triangles made up of smaller triangles, consisting of as many\nas 54 individual proteins, and potentially even more.\n\nResearchers have previously designed synthetic molecules that can form regular\nfractals. But the bacterial protein, called citrate synthase, is the first\nwith such fractal flair to be discovered in nature.\n\nThese electron microscope images show the bacterial protein citrate synthase\nassembling into a triangle made up of smaller triangles.F.L. Sendker et\nal/Nature 2024These electron microscope images show the bacterial protein\ncitrate synthase assembling into a triangle made up of smaller triangles.F.L.\nSendker et al/Nature 2024\n\nThe scientists couldn\u2019t identify any practical purpose for the pattern and\nconcluded that it\u2019s an evolutionary accident. Accidents occur in other\nassemblies of proteins, too. \u201cDifferent kinds of complex-looking structures\ncome and go on evolutionary timescales, sometimes with a use, sometimes\nwithout one,\u201d says Hochberg, of the Max Planck Institute for Terrestrial\nMicrobiology in Marburg, Germany. \u201cTheir symmetry can be beguiling to us, and\nthat\u2019s why we think they have meaning.\u201d\n\nQuestions or comments on this article?
