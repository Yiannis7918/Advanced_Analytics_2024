This\nensures the reliability and performance necessary to meet the rigorous\nrequirements of this industry. Infineon, recognizing these needs, has worked\nwith its Rust partners to offer a complete Rust ecosystem for AURIXTM.\n\nThis collaboration introduces a groundbreaking solution for integrating Rust\ninto automotive controllers, enhancing safety and efficiency without\nsacrificing legacy system compatibility. This initiative is anchored in the\nAURIXTM Rust Startup Ecosystem, which enables Rust and C to coexist\nseamlessly, particularly on the AURIXTM architecture used widely in automotive\nand industrial applications.\n\n### Key highlights\n\n  * Safety and Efficiency: Rust\u2019s memory safety features reduce the risk of bugs and vulnerabilities, crucial for automotive software\u2019s reliability.\n\n  * Legacy Compatibility: The ecosystem supports existing C/C++ code, allowing for the integration of modern Rust functionalities without rewriting legacy systems.\n\n  * ASIL-D Compliance: Integration with PXROS-HR, an ASIL-D certified RTOS, ensures that Rust components meet the highest safety standards without interfering with critical tasks.\n\nThis approach empowers automotive manufacturers to adopt modern software\npractices, ensuring faster development cycles, safer applications, and the\nability to introduce innovative features efficiently.\n\n## Veecle AURIXTM runtime\n\nVeecle provides a Rust runtime for writing automotive and industrial Rust on\ntop of HighTec\u2019s safety kernel for the Infineon AURIXTM Platform.\n\n  * Usable: The code, examples, and tooling have been designed to minimize friction and enable productive development from day one.\n\n  * Future-proof: Integration with a safety kernel and isolation into memory-protected tasks ensures Rust can be used in critical contexts from the outset.\n\n  * Legacy Compatible: By isolating Rust into tasks and allowing FFIs only through kernel messages, we facilitate the coexistence of legacy C tasks with Rust. This enables proven code reuse, thereby avoiding costly re-implementations.\n\nVeecle also maintains tricore-probe: a tool that facilitate flashing and\ndebugging of Rust applications on AURIXTM.\n\n### Try it out\n\nGetting started, installation, and examples can be found on GitHub\n\n## AURIXTM Rust Startup Ecosystem\n\nThe AURIXTM Rust Startup Ecosystem is a collaborative effort involving Veecle,\nInfineon, HighTec and Bluewind aimed at supporting Rust on Infineon\u2019s AURIXTM\narchitecture for automotive and industrial applications. The primary objective\nis to empower customers to seamlessly integrate Rust tasks alongside existing\n\u201cC\u201d implementations for evaluation and pre-development purposes.\n\nThe AURIXTM Rust Startup Ecosystem consists of:\n\n  * A Peripheral Access Crate (PAC) from Infineon.\n  * Low-level drivers from Bluewind, fully written in Rust.\n  * A precompiled version of PXROS-HR, an ASIL-D RTOS written in C, developed by HighTec. Rust PXROS-HR bindings developed jointly by Veecle and HighTec.\n  * A Rust runtime from Veecle, named veecle-pxros, which seamlessly integrates with PXROS-HR, providing a native Rust experience. This runtime also supports asynchronous execution where feasible.\n  * A curated set of examples by Veecle and Bluewind, covering bare metal driver examples, driver instances employing PXROS-HR, and connectivity application demonstrations.\n\nFor the official press release visit Infineon\u2019s promo page.\n\n\u00a9 Veecle GmbH 2024\n\nMissing the cookie banner?
