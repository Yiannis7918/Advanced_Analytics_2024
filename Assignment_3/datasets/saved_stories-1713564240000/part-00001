Microsoft doesn\u2019t have immediate plans to release the new tool to\nthe public, but it\u2019s pretty impressive. Well, it\u2019s impressive if you don\u2019t\nlook too closely at the teeth. Just take a gander at those chompers.\n\n#### Related Content\n\nSam Altman at Davos: AI Needs to Go Nuclear\n\nMicrosoft Forms Alliance to Help Union Workers Stop Worrying and Learn to Love\nAI\n\nLike It or Not, Your Doctor Will Use AI | AI Unlocked\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nview video\n\nLike It or Not, Your Doctor Will Use AI | AI Unlocked\n\nThe VASA-1 model works by taking any still photo of a human face\u2014or, in the\nexamples published by Microsoft, an AI-generated face of someone who doesn\u2019t\nactually exist\u2014and after being fed an audio file, can produce a synchronized\nvideo that includes facial nuances and natural looking motion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Related Content\n\nSam Altman at Davos: AI Needs to Go Nuclear\n\nMicrosoft Forms Alliance to Help Union Workers Stop Worrying and Learn to Love\nAI\n\nLike It or Not, Your Doctor Will Use AI | AI Unlocked\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nLike It or Not, Your Doctor Will Use AI | AI Unlocked\n\nAgain, it\u2019s all quite impressive, as you can see in one of the videos\nMicrosoft provided below. But the one area where VASA-1 seems to struggle is\nrendering teeth. If you focus on the teeth, they can get a cartoonish quality,\nappearing slightly animated in a way that doesn\u2019t quite fit with the hyper-\nrealistic quality of everything else.\n\nVASA-1 Video From Microsoft\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nThe video\u2019s bizarre teeth become even more apparent when you slow the entire\nthing down, as Gizmodo did in the GIF below. (It can almost make you feel bad\npicking apart someone\u2019s appearance until you remember the person below\nliterally doesn\u2019t exist.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGif: Microsoft / Gizmodo\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother example video provided by Microsoft, which appears below, shows\nsimilar cartoon-like qualities in the teeth\u2014even though other features appear\nvery realistic, especially when you remember the only source material is a\nstatic image and an audio file.\n\nVASA-1 Demonstration\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nFor whatever reason, the teeth in videos showing men were slightly less\nnoticeable, perhaps because the model didn\u2019t show men opening their mouths\nquite as wide while speaking. But anyone who looks closely can still get the\nsense something isn\u2019t quite right here.\n\nVASA-1 Demonstration (Male)\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nOne of the more interesting things noted by researchers is that its model can\nproduce relatively high-quality video very quickly, something that other AI\ngenerators like OpenAI\u2019s Sora have reportedly struggled with. In fact, the\npaper notes a latency of just 0.17 seconds on a desktop PC with a single\nNVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that speed is something that can deliver instant videos for a variety of\napplications, like real-time translation services.\n\n\u201cOur method not only delivers high video quality with realistic facial and\nhead dynamics but also supports the online generation of 512x512 videos at up\nto 40 FPS with negligible starting latency. It paves the way for real-time\nengagements with lifelike avatars that emulate human conversational\nbehaviors,\u201d the new paper reads.\n\nReal-time efficiency video of VASA-1\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nThe researchers are clearly aware of the dangers in this kind of tech, which\nperhaps explains why Microsoft hasn\u2019t announced plans to rush it out to the\npublic just yet. However, the researchers have also identified use cases that\nthey believe will be useful to humanity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe benefits\u2014such as enhancing educational equity, improving accessibility\nfor individuals with communication challenges, offering companionship or\ntherapeutic support to those in need, among many others\u2014underscore the\nimportance of our research and other related explorations. We are dedicated to\ndeveloping AI responsibly, with the goal of advancing human well-being,\u201d the\npaper reads.\n\n\u201cGiven such context, we have no plans to release an online demo, API, product,\nadditional implementation details, or any related offerings until we are\ncertain that the technology will be used responsibly and in accordance with\nproper regulations.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s probably a good idea, given the number of scams that are possible with\nthis kind of tech. After all, the 2024 presidential election in the U.S. is\njust seven months away. And the threat of fascism globally isn\u2019t disappearing\nanytime soon. Humanity really does feel like it\u2019s powerless against AI-\ngenerated fakes right now. And large companies like Microsoft should probably\ndo everything in their power to limit the potential harm before virtually\neverything on the internet becomes fakery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n", "frontpage": false}
