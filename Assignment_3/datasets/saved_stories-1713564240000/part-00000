This update was provided as part of their \u2018Moving Forward, Together\u2019\nplan, in March 2023.\n\nThe anticipation of diminishing certificate lifespans has been a long-standing\nprediction. And indeed, it seems it\u2019s no longer a case of \u2018if\u2019, but \u2018when\u2019.\n\nIn September, the Jisc Certificates team conducted a comprehensive survey\nthroughout our customer base, to better understand your thoughts, concerns,\nand requirements from Jisc to help manage this type of change.\n\nIn this blog post, you can find:\n\n  * An update on the 90-day proposal\n  * Headlines from the survey\n  * Insights into what we\u2019ll be doing in response\n\nSound good? Read on to find out more!\n\n### What\u2019s happening with the proposal then?\n\nAlthough Google have not yet confirmed a timeline, Certificate Authorities\nsuch as Sectigo, GlobalSign and Digicert have been advising people to prepare\nfor it to be accepted, and to get ahead of the change.\n\nWhile it was initially indicated that this policy could be implemented as soon\nas October 2024, Google have now said it\u2019s bottom of their priority list, as\nof the latest CA/B Forum meeting in October 2023.\n\nHowever, according to Digicert, \u2018the message from Google and other root\nprograms [remains] clear: Manual certificate management and replacement are no\nlonger acceptable.\u2019\n\nWe have asked Google for further comment on their expected timeline.\n\n## So, what next?\n\nAs we\u2019ve said, this is no longer a case of \u2018if\u2019 but \u2018when\u2019. Although a move to\na 90-day lifespan will no doubt present its short-term frustration for IT\nleaders, this policy change will ultimately benefit internet trust,\noperational efficiency, employee and end-user experiences.\n\nThe decision to shorten certificate durations stems from the imperative to\nheighten cybersecurity measures, making it more challenging for cybercriminals\nto compromise or misuse certificates\u2014an increasingly lucrative threat vector\nin recent years. Sectigo, as well as other CAs and cyber security experts are\nnow emphasising that the longer the duration between information verification,\nthe less reliable the validation becomes. This shift in approach marks a\nsignificant stride in fortifying online security and reflects the industry\u2019s\ncollective commitment to staying ahead of evolving cyber threats.\n\nEmbracing automation and shorter certificate lifecycles aligns with Jisc\u2019s\ncommitment to staying at the forefront of technological advancements and\nbolstering cybersecurity measures for a more resilient digital landscape.\n\nTo mitigate risk of disruption when the 90-day policy is finally implemented\nand get ahead of the curve, we are therefore recommending that all members and\ncustomers start to explore automation as a form of certificate management in\ntheir organisations. This will ensure you are fully prepared for the next\nevolution in cyber security best practices, as and when it does come into\nplay.\n\n## What do other members and customers think?\n\nIf you\u2019re worried about this proposal and what it means for your organisation,\nyou\u2019re not alone.\n\nIn August 2023, Jisc conducted a survey among its members and customers to\ngather feedback on the proposed change and drive to automation, and the kind\nof support you want from us to help navigate through it. Continue reading to\ndelve into some of the key insights that emerged from the survey results:\n\n## Who did the survey go to?\n\n  * The survey was distributed to the most recent two Registration Authority Officers (RAOs) added to our certificate service\n  * The survey garnered almost 300 completed responses, with a total response rate of 23% (including partially completed surveys)\n\n## What were the results?\n\n  * Trouble ahead: Over 95% of respondents were fairly or very worried about managing this type of policy change, with more than 55% saying it would be very difficult to manage .\n  * Automation is not widely adopted: Less than 10% of respondent indicated that they\u2019ve already started incorporating automation into their processes. This means 9 in 10 of you are in the same boat. We are entering unchartered waters together!\n  * Capacity for change: In terms of internal change management capabilities, just over a quarter of respondents expressed confidence in managing the impending changes internally, while a significant 72.5% acknowledged the need for external assistance.\n  * Training & Guidance: most respondents expressed a desire for guidance (77%) and training (63%), due to the lack of skills and knowledge within their organisation. To support this, we\u2019re working on developing a dedicated automation training & guidance hub, which we plan to launch in early 2024. The hub will initially focus on protocols such as ACME and Ansible, however we will continue to update this based on your feedback and support requirements.\n  * Managed Services: Additionally, 35% of respondents, displayed interest in a managed service approach, highlighting the diverse needs and considerations within our community. Jisc are exploring procurement options and aim to provide updates no later than April/May 2024.\n  * Improving functionality with Sectigo: Some members have also requested better access to features and functionality available from Sectigo, that are not yet part of the Jisc x Sectigo Certificate service. Jisc are exploring procurement options with Sectigo and aim to provide updates no later than April/May 2024.\n\nThe verbal feedback trends gleaned from our survey responses also shed light\non several common themes:\n\n  * There is a significant lack of automation skills & knowledge across responding organisations\n  * Particularly in the context of concerns about automating specific systems, including webservers/on-prem servers, VPNs, firewalls/load balancers, legacy systems, VMware, third-party apps and vendors, and hardware.\n  * Many respondents felt they didn\u2019t have the available resources in place to deliver automation\n  * Prevalent poor practices were also a prominent theme, such as widespread use of wild cards\n\nThese insights underscore the nuanced challenges and aspirations within our\ncommunity, guiding our efforts to address and support a diverse range of\nautomation needs. We will be focused on delivering enhanced guidance,\ntraining, functionality and support services throughout 2024, to help address\nthese needs.\n\nAnd that\u2019s all for now. As always, we hope that this has been a helpful\nupdate.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to read our answers to your FAQs about the 90-day change, check\nout our latest blog!\n\nPlease keep an eye out for further updates from Jisc, Google and the CA/B\nForum regarding the implementation timeline and enforcement dates. It\u2019s\ncrucial to note that these policies are not set in stone, and there is\ncurrently no formal ballot at the CA/B Forum for voting on them.\n\nWe\u2019ll be back in touch in the new year with the launch of our automation\nguidance, so look forward to seeing you in 2024!
