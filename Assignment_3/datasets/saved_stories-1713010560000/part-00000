Here, we study the effects of atmospheric turbulence in\ncontinuous-variable entanglement distribution and quantum teleportation in the\noptical regime between a ground station and a satellite. More specifically, we\nstudy the degradation of entanglement due to various error sources in the\ndistribution, namely, diffraction, atmospheric attenuation, turbulence, and\ndetector inefficiency, in both downlink and uplink scenarios. As the fidelity\nof a quantum teleportation protocol using these distributed entangled\nresources is not sufficient, we include an intermediate station for either\nstate generation, or beam refocusing, in order to reduce the effects of\natmospheric turbulence and diffraction, respectively. The results show the\nfeasibility of free-space entanglement distribution and quantum teleportation\nin downlink paths up to the LEO region, but also in uplink paths with the help\nof the intermediate station. Finally, we complete the study with microwave-\noptical comparison in bad weather situations, and with the study of horizontal\npaths in ground-to-ground and inter-satellite quantum communication.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### Spooky action at a global distance: analysis of space-based entanglement\ndistribution for the quantum internet\n\nArticle Open access 04 January 2021\n\nSumeet Khatri, Anthony J.

Eleni Diamanti\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe advantages forecasted by quantum information theory spurred the\ndevelopment of quantum communications^1,2,3,4. A staple of quantum\ncommunication is quantum teleportation^5,6,7, a protocol that aims at\ntransmitting the information contained in an unknown quantum state held by one\nparty, to another party, by means of an entangled quantum resource that they\nboth share. The latter occupies the area of entanglement distribution^8,9,10.\n\nRecent experiments in quantum teleportation with optical fibres showcase a\nhard limit at 100 km^11,12,13,14, mainly due to the inefficiency of single-\nphoton detection. This limit was extended to 143 km when switching to free\nspace^15, connecting two ground stations; when linking a ground station with a\nsatellite, quantum teleportation has been performed over 1000 km^16. Similar\ndistances were achieved for entanglement distribution in ground-to-ground^17\nand ground-to-satellite^18 scenarios.\n\nSetting aside the technological overhead, improvements will go through\nunderstanding the different loss mechanisms in free space, namely diffraction,\natmospheric attenuation, and especially turbulence effects. The latter have\nbeen well studied for classical signals^19,20, and some recent works have\nstudied them in quantum atmospheric transmission channels^21, establishing\nthat non-classicality of signals can be preserved^22. Insightful papers into\nthe effects of free space propagation of quantum signals have also been\npublished ^23,24. More recently, others focused on the limits for key\ngeneration and entanglement distribution between ground stations^25 and\nbetween ground stations and satellites^26, expressing the possibility to\nperform quantum key distribution in different regions of free space through\nthe PLOB bound^27. All these works have contributed to studying the\nlimitations for the involvement of satellites in quantum communications^4,28.\nHere, we contribute by studying how entanglement is degraded between ground\nstations and satellites for performing quantum teleportation.\n\nMore precisely, in this article, we investigate the effect of free-space\nturbulence on the propagation of quantum states in the optical regime, and how\nentanglement (quantified by the negativity of the covariance matrix) is\ndegraded in this process. We assume that two parties attempt to share an\nentangled state, distributed through open air, to perform quantum\nteleportation. Then, we make use of the Braunstein-Kimble teleportation\nprotocol^6 for continuous-variable (CV) systems. Particularly, we consider\nthat we initially have two-mode squeezed vacuum (TMSV) states which are\ndistributed through free space, and we use them to teleport a coherent state.\nIn real experiments, entangled states will also exhibit continuous mode rather\nthan single mode^29. We believe that the more general continuous-mode case is\nalso feasible in the analysis.\n\nWe investigate different instances of quantum communication: ground station to\nsatellite (uplink), satellite to ground station (downlink), and the placement\nof an intermediate station (intermediate), either to generate states, or to\nrefocus the beam. The different quantum communication scenarios studied here\nare depicted in Fig. 1.\n\nFig. 1: Quantum communication scenarios studied in this paper.\n\nWe have investigated downlink and uplink channels, between a ground station\nand a satellite, both directly and with an intermediate station. We have also\nstudied horizontal paths, between two ground stations and between two\nsatellites.\n\nFull size image\n\nWe find that downlink communication through distances up to 2000 kms leads to\nnon-classical teleportation fidelities, while uplink paths of similar\ndistances require an intermediate station to reduce the effect of atmospheric\ndegradation of entanglement. We then study the limits for entanglement\ndistribution and quantum teleportation with microwave signals, and compare\nthem with optical signals, in a bad weather situation. We observe that the\ndistances are highly reduced due to diffraction and thermal noise, as expected\nfor microwaves. We conclude by investigating entanglement distribution and\nquantum teleportation in horizontal paths, i.e. between two ground stations\nand between two satellites.\n\n## Results\n\nWe consider that we have a ground station at altitude h_0 from the surface of\nthe Earth, and a satellite with an orbit radius R_0 and distance from the\nsurface of the Earth h \u2261 R_0 \u2212 R_E, where R_E is the Earth\u2019s radius. Then the\ndistance between the ground station, that sees the satellite at an angle \u03b8,\nand the satellite is z(h, \u03b8). We will consider zenith communication, \u03b8 = 0, in\nthis manuscript, and therefore z = h \u2212 h_0.\n\nIn order to understand the limitations of entanglement distribution and\nquantum teleportation in free space, we need a comprehensive study of loss\nmechanisms. We will describe them through attenuation channels with\ntransmissivity \u03c4_i, that mix a mode of our quantum state with a thermal mode\nfrom the environment. The action of this channel is described by a\nbeamsplitter^30,31, whose action in the Heisenberg picture is characterized by\n\n$$\\begin{array}{rcl}\\hat{a}&\\longrightarrow &\\sqrt{{\\tau\n}_{i}}\\hat{a}+\\sqrt{1-{\\tau }_{i}}{\\hat{a}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{th}}}}}}}}},\\\\\\\n{\\hat{a}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{th}}}}}}}}}&\\longrightarrow &\\sqrt{{\\tau\n}_{i}}{\\hat{a}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{th}}}}}}}}}-\\sqrt{1-{\\tau\n}_{i}}\\hat{a},\\end{array}$$\n\n(1)\n\nfollowed by a partial trace on the environment mode. Here, \\\\(\\hat{a}\\\\) is\nthe annihilation operator for the signal mode, and\n\\\\({\\hat{a}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{th}}}}}}}}}\\\\) is the one for the environment mode.\nIf we assume that the quantum state is propagating through a homogeneous\nthermal environment, then the composite effect of N attenuation channels is\nrepresented by the action of a single one whose effective transmissivity is\n\\\\(\\tau =\\mathop{\\prod }\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{N}{\\tau }_{i}\\\\).\n\nWe consider a loss mechanism composed of diffraction, atmospheric attenuation,\ndetector inefficiency and weak-turbulence effects. The latter comprise beam\nbroadening, which contributes similarly to diffraction, and beam wandering,\nwhich displaces the beam from its original trajectory at random, describing a\ndistribution P(\u03c4) around the beam centroid. The quantum channel, once\ncharacterized by transmissivity \u03c4, is now described by the ensemble\n\\\\({{{{{{{\\mathcal{E}}}}}}}}=\\\\{{{{{{{{{\\mathcal{E}}}}}}}}}_{\\tau },P(\\tau\n)\\\\}\\\\), where the channel \\\\({{{{{{{{\\mathcal{E}}}}}}}}}_{\\tau }\\\\) is\nselected at random with a probability taken from the distribution P(\u03c4). This\nis called a fading channel.\n\nWe will use this to describe the degradation of entanglement on states\npropagating through free space, which we will quantify through the negativity\nof the covariance matrix of Gaussian states, and through the average fidelity\nof teleporting an unknown coherent state using the entangled resources. Both\nthe teleportation fidelity and the negativity are reduced because the\nentanglement of the state degrades while propagating through free space. The\ndegradation is more severe with increasing distance, as the transmissivity of\nthe fading channel decreases.\n\nHere, we will consider two-mode squeezed states as a typical case of bipartite\nCV entangled states. A TMSV state can be described by the two-mode squeezing\noperator acting on a two-mode vacuum state,\n\n$$\\begin{array}{rcl}{\\left\\vert {{\\mbox{TMSV}}}\\right\\rangle\n}_{1,2}&=&{e}^{\\frac{r}{2}\\left({\\hat{a}}_{1}{\\hat{a}}_{2}-{\\hat{a}}_{1}^{{{{\\dagger}}}\n}{\\hat{a}}_{2}^{{{{\\dagger}}} }\\right)}{\\left\\vert 0,0\\right\\rangle }_{1,2}\\\\\\\n&\\propto &\\sqrt{1-{\\lambda }^{2}}\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{n=0}^{\\infty }{\\lambda\n}^{n}{\\left\\vert n,n\\right\\rangle }_{1,2},\\end{array}$$\n\n(2)\n\nand can be represented in the Fock basis as shown above, with \\\\(\\lambda\n=\\tanh r\\\\). Since two-mode squeezed states are Gaussian, and the fading\nchannel is Gaussian-preserving, we can use the covariance-matrix formalism to\ndescribe the evolution of the state. This will provide the obvious advantages\nof using finite-dimensional matrices to work with infinite-dimensional\noperators, but it will also lead to a convenient description of fading\nchannels. Consider a two-mode Gaussian state with vanishing first moments and\ncovariance matrix in normal form given by^32\n\n$$\\Sigma =\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\\alpha {{\\mathbb{1}}}_{2}&\\gamma Z\\\\\\ \\gamma\nZ&\\beta {{\\mathbb{1}}}_{2}\\end{array}\\right),$$\n\n(3)\n\nand consider a single-mode environment described by a Gaussian state with\ncovariance matrix \\\\(E=m{{\\mathbb{1}}}_{2}\\\\). Here, m = 1 + 2n, where n is\nthe average number of thermal photons. We consider a thermal state for the\nenvironment because when we measure our signal at the receiver, the detector\nwill also collect photons from the environment. We want the attenuation\nchannel to describe not only absorption losses when the signal propagates\nthrough the environment, but also this phenomenon. Since the average number of\nphotons collected will not be zero, and we assume that they are completely\nuncorrelated, the state of the environment must be a thermal state.\n\nIn the symplectic formalism, we can work in two regimes of turbulence: fast\nturbulence (and slow detection), and slow turbulence (and fast detection). The\nformer assumes that turbulence is a fast process, or at least it is much\nfaster than the detectors. Therefore we observe only an average\ncharacterization of the channel through \u3008\u03c4\u3009, and the fidelity and the\nnegativity are characterized by \\\\(\\overline{F}(\\langle \\tau \\rangle )\\\\) and\n\\\\({{{{{{{\\mathcal{N}}}}}}}}(\\langle \\tau \\rangle )\\\\), respectively. The\nlatter considers the detectors to be much faster than the turbulence, and then\nthe channel is characterized by \u03c4 instead of by \u3008\u03c4\u3009. Nevertheless, the\nnegativity and the quantum teleportation fidelity have to be averaged over all\nuses of the channel,\n\n$$\\begin{array}{rcl}{{{{{{{\\mathcal{N}}}}}}}}&=&\\int\\nolimits_{0}^{{\\tau\n}_{\\max }}d\\tau {P}_{0}(\\tau ) {{{{{{{\\mathcal{N}}}}}}}}(\\tau ),\\\\\\\n\\overline{F}&=&\\int\\nolimits_{0}^{{\\tau }_{\\max }}d\\tau {P}_{0}(\\tau\n)\\overline{F}(\\tau ).\\end{array}$$\n\n(4)\n\nFor an entangled Gaussian resource that has the covariance matrix in Eq. (3),\nthe average fidelity of teleporting an unknown coherent state is\n\\\\(\\overline{F}={\\left[1+\\frac{1}{2}(\\alpha +\\beta -2\\gamma\n)\\right]}^{-1}\\\\)^33. In the symplectic formalism, the effects of the\nattenuation channel are described by a beamsplitter transformation applied to\nthe covariance matrix that describes our initial state as well as a thermal\nstate from the environment. This is characterized by\n\n$$\\begin{array}{rcl}\\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}{{\\mathbb{1}}}_{2}&{{\\mathbb{0}}}_{2}&{{\\mathbb{0}}}_{2}\\\\\\\n{{\\mathbb{0}}}_{2}&\\sqrt{\\tau }{{\\mathbb{1}}}_{2}&\\sqrt{1-\\tau\n}{{\\mathbb{1}}}_{2}\\\\\\ {{\\mathbb{0}}}_{2}&-\\sqrt{1-\\tau\n}{{\\mathbb{1}}}_{2}&\\sqrt{\\tau\n}{{\\mathbb{1}}}_{2}\\end{array}\\right)\\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}\\alpha\n{{\\mathbb{1}}}_{2}&\\gamma Z&{{\\mathbb{0}}}_{2}\\\\\\ \\gamma Z&\\beta\n{{\\mathbb{1}}}_{2}&{{\\mathbb{0}}}_{2}\\\\\\\n{{\\mathbb{0}}}_{2}&{{\\mathbb{0}}}_{2}&m{{\\mathbb{1}}}_{2}\\end{array}\\right)\n\\\\\\\n{\\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}{{\\mathbb{1}}}_{2}&{{\\mathbb{0}}}_{2}&{{\\mathbb{0}}}_{2}\\\\\\\n{{\\mathbb{0}}}_{2}&\\sqrt{\\tau }{{\\mathbb{1}}}_{2}&\\sqrt{1-\\tau\n}{{\\mathbb{1}}}_{2}\\\\\\ {{\\mathbb{0}}}_{2}&-\\sqrt{1-\\tau\n}{{\\mathbb{1}}}_{2}&\\sqrt{\\tau }{{\\mathbb{1}}}_{2}\\end{array}\\right)}^{\\top\n}=\\\\\\ \\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}\\alpha {{\\mathbb{1}}}_{2}&\\sqrt{\\tau }\\gamma\nZ&-\\sqrt{1-\\tau }\\gamma Z\\\\\\ \\sqrt{\\tau }\\gamma Z&\\left[\\tau \\beta +(1-\\tau\n)m\\right]{{\\mathbb{1}}}_{2}&(m-b)\\sqrt{\\tau (1-\\tau )}{{\\mathbb{1}}}_{2}\\\\\\\n-\\sqrt{1-\\tau }\\gamma Z&(m-b)\\sqrt{\\tau (1-\\tau\n)}{{\\mathbb{1}}}_{2}&\\left[(1-\\tau )\\beta +\\tau\nm\\right]{{\\mathbb{1}}}_{2}\\end{array}\\right),\\end{array}$$\n\n(5)\n\nmixing the second mode of our entangled state with the thermal state. If we\ntrace out the reflected part, we end up with the covariance matrix\n\n$$\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\\alpha {{\\mathbb{1}}}_{2}&\\sqrt{\\tau }\\gamma Z\\\\\\\n\\sqrt{\\tau }\\gamma Z&\\left[\\tau \\beta +(1-\\tau\n)m\\right]{{\\mathbb{1}}}_{2}\\end{array}\\right).$$\n\n(6)\n\nTherefore, the quantum teleportation fidelity after a fast-turbulence fading\nchannel becomes\n\n$$\\frac{1}{\\overline{F}}=\\left\\\\{1+\\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\alpha +\\langle \\tau\n\\rangle \\beta +\\left(1-\\langle \\tau \\rangle \\right)m-2\\langle \\sqrt{\\tau\n}\\rangle \\gamma \\right]\\right\\\\},$$\n\n(7)\n\nwhile for the slow fading channel, the average is computed numerically. The\nother quantity in which we are interested is the negativity of the covariance\nmatrix, a measure for entanglement. For two-mode Gaussian states, it is given\nby^34\n\n$${{{{{{{\\mathcal{N}}}}}}}}=\\max \\left\\\\{0,\\frac{1-{\\tilde{\\nu\n}}_{-}}{2{\\tilde{\\nu }}_{-}}\\right\\\\},$$\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \\\\({\\tilde{\\nu }}_{-}\\\\) is the smallest symplectic eigenvalue of the\npartially-transposed covariance matrix. For the one in Eq. (3), it can be\nwritten as\n\n$${\\tilde{\\nu }}_{-}=\\frac{\\alpha +\\beta -\\sqrt{{(\\alpha -\\beta\n)}^{2}+4{\\gamma }^{2}}}{2}.$$\n\n(9)\n\nNotice that the condition for entanglement is \\\\({\\tilde{\\nu }}_{-} < 1\\\\),\nwhich can be expressed as (\u03b1 \u2212 1)(\u03b2 \u2212 1) < \u03b3^2.\n\nHere, we investigate the teleportation fidelity and the negativity associated\nwith a two-mode squeezed state with covariance matrix^32\n\n$$\\Sigma =\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\\cosh 2r{{\\mathbb{1}}}_{2}&\\sinh 2rZ\\\\\\ \\sinh\n2rZ&\\cosh 2r{{\\mathbb{1}}}_{2}\\end{array}\\right),$$\n\n(10)\n\nwhere r is the squeezing parameter, and it is directly related with the\n(initial) negativity through \\\\({\\tilde{\\nu }}_{-} ={e}^{-2r}\\\\), meaning no\nentanglement for r = 0, and infinite entanglement for r \u2192 \u221e. The teleportation\nfidelity associated with using a TMSV state is\n\\\\(\\overline{F}={\\left(1+{e}^{-2r}\\right)}^{-1}\\\\)^33, and it reaches the\nmaximum classical fidelity of 1/2 for no squeezing (r = 0), while approaching\n1 for infinite squeezing (r \u2192 \u221e).\n\n### Downlink and uplink\n\nHere, we investigate two communication scenarios: downlink and uplink. In the\nformer, two-mode Gaussian entangled states are generated at a satellite, and\none of the modes is sent down to a ground station; in the latter, the states\nare generated at a ground station and one of the modes is sent to a satellite.\nWe consider that the second mode is the one transmitted through open air, and\ntherefore it is affected by the fading channel. The covariance matrix is then\ntransformed into\n\n$${\\Sigma }^{{\\prime} }=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\\alpha\n{{\\mathbb{1}}}_{2}&\\left\\langle \\sqrt{\\tau }\\right\\rangle \\gamma Z\\\\\\\n\\left\\langle \\sqrt{\\tau }\\right\\rangle \\gamma Z&\\left[\\langle \\tau \\rangle\n\\beta +\\left(1-\\langle \\tau \\rangle\n\\right)m\\right]{{\\mathbb{1}}}_{2}\\end{array}\\right)$$\n\n(11)\n\nby keeping only the transmitted contribution, in the regime of fast\nturbulence. In the case of downlink communications with daytime thermal noise,\nfor example, the thermal state from the environment is characterized by\n\\\\(m=1+2{\\tau\n}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{eff}}}}}}}}}{n}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{day}}}}}}}}}^{{{{{{{{\\rm{down}}}}}}}}}\\\\).\nThe characterization of the various effects that the fading channel encases,\nnamely diffraction, atmospheric attenuation, turbulence, and detector\ninefficiency, is presented in 'Methods'.\n\nIn Fig. 2a, b, we represent the negativity of a TMSV state with initial\nsqueezing r = 1 against the altitude of the link. Figure 2a shows the results\nfor a downlink, and Fig. 2b illustrates an uplink. In solid lines, we can see\nthe results of a fast-turbulence scenario, whereas the dashed lines represent\na slow-turbulence one. Furthermore, blue and red lines incorporate nighttime\nand daytime thermal noise, respectively. In full color, we can see the values\nassociated with perfect detector efficiency, \u03c4_eff = 1, whereas the lines with\nhigh transparency correspond to faulty detectors with \u03c4_eff = 0.4. We can\nobserve that the negativity is reduced exponentially with the distance, and we\nsee better results for a downlink than for an uplink. In vertical lines, we\nmark zones associated to different orbital altitudes. These are the low-Earth\norbit (LEO), from 200 km to 2000 km and the medium-Earth orbit (MEO), from\n2000 km to 42,164 km. Orbits from 42,164 km on are known as geostationary\norbits.\n\nFigure. 2c, d show the fidelity of a quantum teleportation protocol for\ncoherent states, that uses TMSV states distributed through (c) a downlink or\n(d) an uplink in free space. The degradation of the entanglement of this state\nis due to the various loss mechanisms that comprise the fading channel:\ndiffraction, atmospheric attenuation, detector inefficiency and turbulence.\nThis degradation is responsible for the deterioration of the teleportation\nfidelity, which depends only on the entangled resource that is consumed. The\nslow-turbulence regime is represented by dashed lines, while the fast-\nturbulence regime is represented by solid lines. The red ones incorporate\ndaytime thermal noise, whereas the blue ones consider nighttime thermal noise.\nPerfect detector efficiency (\u03c4_eff = 1) is represented by full-color lines,\nwhile an imperfect detector (\u03c4_eff = 0.4) was considered in the high-\ntransparency lines. Here, we observe that only quantum teleportation protocols\nthrough a downlink in the LEO region can produce fidelities above the maximum\nclassical result^35; all instances worse than this are enclosed in a pale red\nbackground. Notice that, in Fig. 2c, results for daytime and nighttime thermal\nnoise coincide, both in the perfect and imperfect detector scenarios. This\nalso happens for short distances in Fig. 2a.\n\nFig. 2: Uplink and downlink quantum communication between a ground station and\na satellite.\n\nWe use a two-mode squeezed vacuum state distributed through free space, which\nhas undergone a loss mechanism comprising diffraction, atmospheric extinction,\ndetector inefficiency and free-space turbulence, for a signal with wavelength\n\u03bb = 800 nm, squeezing parameter r = 1, and waist \u03c0_0 = 20 cm, assuming the\nreceiver has an antenna with aperture a_R = 40 cm. We represent the negativity\nfor (a) a downlink and (b) an uplink. We also represent the fidelity of\nquantum teleportation for coherent states using this entangled resource, for\n(c) a downlink and (d) an uplink. Dashed lines represent the regime of slow\nturbulence, and solid lines represent the regime of fast turbulence, when\ncomparing them to the velocity of the detectors. Nighttime and daytime thermal\nnoise is taken into account in the blue and red curves, respectively. In the\ncase of the downlink fidelity, note that the results which incorporate daytime\n(red) and nighttime (blue) thermal noise coincide. In full color, we present\nthe results for perfect detector efficiency, \u03c4_eff = 1, whereas the high-\ntransparency curves correspond to \u03c4_eff = 0.4.\n\nFull size image\n\nThe difference we can appreciate between the results for the uplink and for\nthe downlink channels resides in the way turbulence affects signals at\ndifferent stages of the path. In the uplink, turbulence acts at the beginning\nof the path and, especially due to the effects of beam wandering, it affects\nsignals in a way that is carried on through the whole trajectory. Since\nsignals have not travelled for a long distance, they have only diffracted\nslightly, and it occurs that the size of the beam is still small and\ncomparable with the turbulence-induced eddies in the atmosphere, so they are a\nbig effect in terms of angle deviation. This displacement from the original\nfocusing point of the beam introduces a significant error. In the case of the\ndownlink, turbulence acts at the end of the path, when the signals enter the\natmosphere; at that point, they present a large waist due to diffraction, and\nthe wandering effects are not so severe. This basically means that we are able\nto detect more signal photons in the downlink than in the uplink.\n\n### Intermediate station for state generation\n\nWe have observed that the effects of turbulence are more severe in the\natmosphere and have stronger effects on signals that have not suffered\ndiffraction. Therefore, the scenario in which we have an uplink path presents\nmore difficulties for free-space entanglement distribution. Nevertheless, we\ninvestigate a scenario in which there is an intermediate station connecting\nthe ground station and the satellite, and we consider that TMSV states can be\ngenerated at this intermediate station. Our goal is to observe whether there\nis an increase in the entanglement available when the distance that the\nsignals travel through free space is reduced. This already presents an\nadvantage, because now the uplink does not start at the Earth, but at a given\norbit, and the turbulence effects are highly reduced.\n\nIn this case, the covariance matrix of the two-mode Gaussian state, after a\nsingle application of the fading channel, is\n\n$${\\Sigma }^{{\\prime} }=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\\left[{\\tau\n}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{d}}}}}}}}}\\alpha +(1-{\\tau\n}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{d}}}}}}}}}){m}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{d}}}}}}}}}\\right]{{\\mathbb{1}}}_{2}&\\sqrt{{\\tau\n}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{d}}}}}}}}}{\\tau }_{{{{{{{{\\rm{u}}}}}}}}}}\\gamma Z\\\\\\ \\sqrt{{\\tau\n}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{d}}}}}}}}}{\\tau }_{{{{{{{{\\rm{u}}}}}}}}}}\\gamma Z&\\left[{\\tau\n}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{u}}}}}}}}}\\beta +\\left(1-{\\tau\n}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{u}}}}}}}}}\\right){m}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{u}}}}}}}}}\\right]{{\\mathbb{1}}}_{2}\\end{array}\\right),$$\n\n(12)\n\nwhere we define by \u03c4_d(u) the transmissivity of the fading channel describing\nsignal propagation through the downlink (uplink). After multiple applications\nof the fading channel, in the case of fast turbulence and slow detection, we\nwill have that the negativity and the teleportation fidelity can be averaged\nas \\\\({{{{{{{\\mathcal{N}}}}}}}}={{{{{{{\\mathcal{N}}}}}}}}\\left(\\langle {\\tau\n}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{d}}}}}}}}}\\rangle ,\\langle {\\tau }_{{{{{{{{\\rm{u}}}}}}}}}\\rangle\n\\right)\\\\) and \\\\(\\overline{F}=\\overline{F}\\left(\\langle {\\tau\n}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{d}}}}}}}}}\\rangle ,\\langle {\\tau }_{{{{{{{{\\rm{u}}}}}}}}}\\rangle\n\\right)\\\\), respectively. On the opposite regime, slow turbulence and fast\ndetection, these averages are computed as\n\n$$\\begin{array}{rcl}{{{{{{{\\mathcal{N}}}}}}}}&=&\\int\\nolimits_{0}^{{\\tau\n}_{{{{{{{{{\\rm{d}}}}}}}}}^{\\max }}}\\,{{\\mbox{d}}}\\,{\\tau\n}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{d}}}}}}}}}P({\\tau\n}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{d}}}}}}}}})\\int\\nolimits_{0}^{{\\tau\n}_{{{{{{{{{\\rm{u}}}}}}}}}^{\\max }}}\\,{{\\mbox{d}}}\\,{\\tau\n}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{u}}}}}}}}}P({\\tau\n}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{u}}}}}}}}}){{{{{{{\\mathcal{N}}}}}}}}\\left({\\tau\n}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{d}}}}}}}}},{\\tau }_{{{{{{{{\\rm{u}}}}}}}}}\\right),\\\\\\\n\\overline{F}&=&\\int\\nolimits_{0}^{{\\tau }_{{{{{{{{{\\rm{d}}}}}}}}}^{\\max\n}}}\\,{{\\mbox{d}}}\\,{\\tau }_{{{{{{{{\\rm{d}}}}}}}}}P({\\tau\n}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{d}}}}}}}}})\\int\\nolimits_{0}^{{\\tau\n}_{{{{{{{{{\\rm{u}}}}}}}}}^{\\max }}}\\,{{\\mbox{d}}}\\,{\\tau\n}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{u}}}}}}}}}P({\\tau\n}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{u}}}}}}}}})\\overline{F}\\left({\\tau\n}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{d}}}}}}}}},{\\tau }_{{{{{{{{\\rm{u}}}}}}}}}\\right).\\end{array}$$\n\n(13)\n\nIn Fig. 3a, we represent the negativity of the final state, considering an\noptimal placement of the intermediate station, for each value of the total\nheight. These optimal points are shown in Fig. 3c for the negativity and in\nFig. 3d for the teleportation fidelity. We can observe that the results are\nimproved, with respect to both the downlink and the uplink. We can also see\nthis improvement, especially with respect to the uplink, and remarkably for\nhigh altitudes, in Fig. 3b. Here, we represent the fidelity of teleporting an\nunknown coherent state using TMSV states, generated at the intermediate\nstation, and having both modes distributed through the noisy and turbulent\nlinks. Only the fidelities with nighttime thermal noise remain above the\nmaximum classical fidelity of 1/2, while the accumulated thermal noise in\ndaytime links leads to fidelities that fall below this limit at altitudes in\nthe LEO region. We can see that the limit is extended with respect to the\ndownlink, and the fidelity for an uplink never achieved values above it.\nTherefore, the generation of entangled states in an intermediate station\nbetween the ground station and the satellite greatly improves the\nteleportation fidelity.\n\nFig. 3: Uplink and downlink quantum communication between a ground station and\na satellite, using an intermediate station for state generation.\n\nWe consider that one mode of the state is sent to the ground station, and the\nother to the satellite. a Negativity of transmitted two-mode squeezed vacuum\nstates in free-space communication against the height of the satellite link,\nwith respect to the ground station. We consider that these stated are\ngenerated in an intermediate station, where one mode is sent to the ground\nstation and the other to the satellite. We study a signal with wavelength \u03bb =\n800 nm, squeezing parameter r = 1, and initial waist \u03c0_0 = 20 cm, sent to a\nreceiver that has an antenna of radius a_R = 40 cm. This signal is subject to\na loss mechanism composed of diffraction, atmospheric extinction, detector\ninefficiency and free-space turbulence, described by a fading channel. In this\ncase, the results that incorporate daytime (red) and nighttime (blue) thermal\nnoise coincide. We distinguish between the results obtained in the slow-\nturbulence and fast-detection regime, in dashed lines, and the fast-turbulence\nand slow-detection regime, in solid lines. The results for perfect detector\nefficiency, \u03c4_eff = 1, appear in full color, whereas the transparent curves\ncorrespond to \u03c4_eff = 0.4. b Fidelity of teleporting an unknown coherent state\nusing these entangled resources. We represent the optimal position of the\nintermediate station, for the different turbulence conditions, that achieve\nthe maximum possible negativities in (c), and those that lead to maximum\nfidelities, in (d).\n\nFull size image\n\nIn the case of the negativity with an intermediate station, we observe an\nimprovement, especially in the case of ideal detectors; for imperfect ones,\nrepresented by \u03c4_eff = 0.4, the results do not differ significantly from those\nof the downlink. This is because, for an intermediate station, we are\nconsidering now two detection events, instead of one, which enhances the error\nin the case of imperfect detectors. On the contrary, the results for the\nteleportation fidelity are highly improved with an intermediate station, and\nextend also to the case of imperfect detectors. Although, for imperfect\ndetectors, fidelities with daytime thermal noise can go below the maximum\nclassical fidelity. Of course, it would be natural to assume that we obtain\ngood results for the fidelity because we are optimizing the placement of the\nintermediate station and keeping the highest fidelity at each altitude. And\nrightly so, but the improvement difference in the negativity and the fidelity\nis due to the fact that, when considering the intermediate station, the states\ngenerated there, and distributed through a downlink to Earth and though an\nuplink to a satellite, which makes them more symmetric. In the case of a\nsingle downlink or uplink, one of the modes was kept and the other was sent\nthrough free space, resulting in a covariance matrix that was highly\nasymmetric (see Eq. (11)). Given two Gaussian quantum states with the same\nnegativity, the one whose covariance matrix is more symmetric shows higher\nteleportation fidelity. For further discussion, see section 'Intermediate\nstation improvement'.\n\n### Intermediate station for beam focusing\n\nHere, we consider using the intermediate station as a point where the signal\nis refocused, in an attempt to reduce the effects of diffraction and\nturbulence. This could improve the transmissivity of the downlink, but\nespecially that of the uplink, where the turbulence effects are more damaging.\nThis is what we observe in Fig. 4, where we represent the transmissivity of\nthe fading channel describing the propagation through the link, against the\ntotal height. In Fig. 4a the transmissivity for a downlink is improved in the\nideal case, similarly to how it was improved by generating the states in the\nintermediate station; in this case, however, we consider that the sender\ngenerates both modes, and thus only have one detector at the receiver.\nFurthermore, we believe that an intermediate station and an intermediate lens\ncontribute about equally to improving the transmissivity of the channel,\nconsidering a downlink, a comparison that is illustrated in section\n'Intermediate station improvement'. However, when we see the case of an uplink\nin Fig. 4b, we notice that it is substantially improved, achieving values\nabove the transmissivity of the downlink. This is because the optimal\nlocations of the focusing lens, represented in Fig. 4c for the downlink and in\nFig. 4d for the uplink, the former is growing with the height of the link,\nwhile the latter falls in a range of tens of kilometres, very close to the\nground station, in order to reduce the effects of turbulence inside the\natmosphere. As a last remark, see that the results the results for daytime and\nnighttime thermal noise coincide for certain ranges, in Fig. 4, both in\ndownlink and uplink scenarios.\n\nFig. 4: Average transmissivity of a turbulent fading channel connecting a\nground station and a satellite using a refocusing lens.\n\nThis channel is composed of diffraction, atmospheric extinction, detector\ninefficiency and free-space turbulence. In a solid line, we plot the\nquantities associated an unaltered channel, and in a dashed line, we represent\nthe cases in which a lens has been placed in a mid point of the link to reduce\nbeam broadening. In full color we represent the results for perfect detector\nefficiency, \u03c4_eff = 1, whereas imperfect detection, \u03c4_eff = 0.4, is marked by\nthe transparent curves. In blue, we represent the result associated with\nnighttime thermal noise, whereas those associated to daytime thermal noise\nappear in red. We represent the results associated to a downlink in (a), with\nthe optimal location of the lens, in order to maximize the transmissivity,\ngiven in (c). The results for nighttime thermal noise fall on top of those for\ndaytime thermal noise. The results associated to an uplink are represented in\n(b), with optimal positions of the lens shown in (d).\n\nFull size image\n\nA theoretical proposal for beam refocusing using a thin lens, or pupil, has\nbeen published^36 which investigates the advantages of this operation over\ndirect propagation in different free-space ranges. Furthermore, an\nentanglement distribution experiment using drones as quantum relays to\nmitigate the effects of diffraction has also been described^37. Despite using\njust two drones, it sets an example for future quantum communication\nexperiments to aim at maintaining beams at the Rayleigh limit.\n\n### Microwave slant links\n\nWe aim at expanding the results shown in this manuscript by considering the\nattenuation of microwave quantum signals in free-space propagation. The major\ndifference with the model for signals in the optical regime will be the\nomission of turbulence effects. Given the wavelengths for microwaves, on the\norder of centimetres, we can see that they will not be affected by the\nfluctuations that lead to turbulence for optical signals. Nevertheless, also\nbecause of the long wavelengths, microwaves will be highly affected by\ndiffraction. By proposing a loss mechanism composed of diffraction,\natmospheric attenuation and detector inefficiency, we aim at investigating the\nlimits for entanglement distribution and quantum teleportation with microwaves\nin free space.\n\nDue to the bright thermal background that microwave present at room\ntemperatures, these states are generated at cryogenic temperatures;\nnevertheless, we consider that the squeezing operations are applied to a\nthermal state, and not to an ideal vacuum state, which leads to the more\nrealistic two-mode squeezed thermal state. This is also a Gaussian state, with\ncovariance matrix\n\n$$\\Sigma =(1+2n)\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\\cosh 2r{{\\mathbb{1}}}_{2}&\\sinh 2rZ\\\\\\\n\\sinh 2rZ&\\cosh 2r{{\\mathbb{1}}}_{2}\\end{array}\\right) \\equiv\n\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}c{{\\mathbb{1}}}_{2}& s Z \\\\\\ s Z & c\n{{\\mathbb{1}}}_{2}\\end{array}\\right).$$\n\n(14)\n\nOur choice of entangled resource describes a two-mode squeezed thermal (TMST)\nstate, characterized by n = 10^\u22122 average number of thermal photons per mode,\nand squeezing parameter r = 1.\n\nIn order for these states to remain entangled when distributed through free\nspace, we need the transmissivity of the channel to satisfy\n\n$$\\tau > \\frac{(m-1)(c-1)}{(m-c)(c-1)+{s}^{2}},$$\n\n(15)\n\nassuming that m > c, for a state represented by the covariance matrix in Eq.\n(11) with \u03b1 = \u03b2 = c and \u03b3 = s. If the state is symmetric, and its covariance\nmatrix resembles that in Eq. (12), with \u03c4_d \u2248 \u03c4_u \u2261 \u03c4, this condition turns to\n\n$$\\tau > \\frac{m-1}{m-c+s}.$$\n\n(16)\n\nThese equations are general for any Gaussian state, and are independent of the\nattenuation mechanism. This is simply a way to obtain limits on the\ntransmissivity of free space. Considering identical initial resources (see Eq.\n(10)), this condition is always more restrictive for symmetric (\u03c4 > 0.9997)\nthan for asymmetric states (\u03c4 > 0.9992, given the states studied here).\n\nBy knowing, among other things, the arrival time of the signal, we can reduce\nthe amount of thermal noise that is detected. With this, the condition for\nentanglement preservation on asymmetric states becomes \u03c4 > 0.996. Then, we see\nthat the entanglement-distribution limit is 44 m, while the fidelity reaches\nthe classical limit at 43 m. In this case, the asymmetry between both modes of\nthe state distributed through free space does not lead to a significant\ndifference between entanglement preservation and quantum teleportation\ndistances. For symmetric states, the condition for symmetric states is \u03c4 >\n0.998. Considering an intermediate station for state generation, the\nentanglement-distribution and quantum teleportation limit extends to 49 m. On\nthe other hand, an intermediate station for beam refocusing leads to a limit\nfor entanglement preservation at 52 m, whereas the teleportation fidelity\nreaches the classical limit at 49 m.\n\nAs we can observe, microwave quantum communication is highly limited by\ndiffraction and thermal noise. However, inside the atmosphere, the attenuation\nsuffered by microwaves in severe weather conditions is inferior to that\nsuffered by optical signals. Let us look at an example, and compare the\nperformance of signals in both regimes. We observe that, when the link starts\non the ground, microwaves can only do as well as optical for a short distance.\nThis can be observed in Fig. 5, where we represent the negativity (a) and the\nteleportation fidelity (b) associated to a TMSV state distributed through free\nspace. The effects of diffraction remain severe on microwave signals. These\nresults show that microwave quantum communication can be appropriate for\ninter-satellite quantum communications. There, the conditions for entanglement\npreservation become \u03c4 > 0.706 for asymmetric states, and \u03c4 > 0.847 for\nsymmetric ones, with an effective number of thermal photons n = 2.39.\n\nFig. 5: Performance comparison between microwave and optical signals in free\nspace quantum communications under severe weather conditions.\n\nWe represent the negativity (a) and the quantum teleportation fidelity (b) for\ntwo-mode squeezed vacuum states generated at a ground station at an altitude\nof 10 m, and where one of the modes is sent through an uplink. We consider the\nsignal has squeezing parameter r = 1, and initial waist \u03c0_0 = 1 m, assuming\nthe receiver has an antenna of radius a_R = 2 m. In red, we represent the\nresults associated to a signal in the optical regime, with wavelength \u03bb = 800\nnm and zero thermal photons, whereas in blue we represent the results for\nmicrowave signals with wavelength \u03bb = 6 cm and n = 10^\u22122 thermal photons. For\noptical signals, the thermal noise coming from the environment is\ncharacterized by 13.57 photons, whereas for microwave signals, we have 266\nphotons. In full color, we present the results for perfect detector\nefficiency, \u03c4_eff = 1, whereas the transparent curves correspond to \u03c4_eff =\n0.4. The pale red background represents the region in which the teleportation\nfidelity falls below the maximum classical value.\n\nFull size image\n\n### Horizontal paths\n\nFor the sake of completeness, we investigate the effects that free-space\npropagation through turbulent media inside the same region has on the\nnegativity of TMSV states, and how it affects the fidelity of a quantum\nteleportation protocol that uses these states as resources, in order to\nteleport an unknown coherent state. The two scenarios that we present here are\nground-to-ground and satellite-to-satellite (inter-satellite) communications.\nThe attenuation channel characterizing the former includes diffraction,\natmospheric attenuation, turbulence and detector inefficiency, and is\ndescribed up to 1200 km distances because, with the parameters considered\nhere, this represents the frontier of weak turbulence. The attenuation channel\ncharacterizing the latter has the same contributions, except for the\nturbulence effects that lead to beam broadening. This is not considered\nbecause the refraction index structure constant is smaller outside the\natmosphere. Nevertheless, we still consider pointing errors caused by\nturbulence.\n\nWe represent the results of entanglement distribution and quantum\nteleportation with TMSV states between two ground stations in Fig. 6. Daytime\n(nighttime) results are shown in red (blue), and the solid (dashed) curves\ncorrespond to fast (slow) turbulence. The high-transparency curves show the\nresults for inefficient detectors, with \u03c4_eff = 0.4, whereas the curves in\nfull color correspond to ideal detection, with \u03c4_eff = 1. In Fig. 6a, we show\nthe negativity of the TMSV state, with squeezing parameter r = 1, against the\ntraveled distance. In Fig. 6b, we represent the negativity for the same TMSV\nstates, distributed between two satellites in the same orbit. In this\nscenario, the only relevant sources of noise are diffraction, pointing errors,\nand detector inefficiency. Here, the solid lines are associated to fast\nturbulence and slow detection, whereas the dashed lines describe slow-\nturbulence and fast-detection results; notice that these appear overlapped.\n\nFig. 6: Quantum communication through horizontal paths.\n\nUsing two-mode squeezed vacuum states distributed through free space, ground-\nto-ground station quantum communication is studied through the negativity (a)\nand the quantum teleportation fidelity (c). The states are subject to a loss\nmechanism composed of diffraction, atmospheric extinction, detector\ninefficiency and free-space turbulence. Inter-satellite quantum communication\nis studied through the negativity (b) and the quantum teleportation fidelity\n(d), where now the only loss mechanisms relevant are diffraction, pointing\nerrors, and detector inefficiency. We consider the signal has wavelength \u03bb =\n800 nm, squeezing parameter r = 1, and initial waist \u03c0_0 = 5 cm, assuming the\nreceiver has an antenna of radius a_R = 5 cm. In red, we represent the results\nthat incorporate daytime thermal noise, whereas the blue lines consider\nnighttime thermal noise. The dashed lines correspond to the instance of slow\nturbulence and fast detection, and the solid lines correspond to fast\nturbulence and slow detection. In full color, we present the results for\nperfect detector efficiency, \u03c4_eff = 1, whereas the transparent curves\ncorrespond to \u03c4_eff = 0.4.\n\nFull size image\n\nWe show the average fidelity of quantum teleportation using the states\ndistributed between two ground stations in Fig. 6c. We observe that, even in\nthe low detector-efficiency case, entanglement is preserved, and therefore\nquantum teleportation fidelity is still higher than the maximum classical\nfidelity achievable, marked in a pale red background in Fig. 6c. In Fig. 6d,\nwe do the same for the states distributed between two satellites. A similar\nstudy regarding microwave signals can be found^38. There, the size of the\nantenna is taken to be much larger. Given the long wavelengths, the size of\nthe antenna, as well as the initial spot size of the beam are crucial\nparameters for entanglement preservation.\n\nThe range of distances chosen to represent these quantities corresponds to the\n\u201csweet spot\u201d 200\u2264 z \u22641066, were the weak-turbulence expansion used here is\napproximately correct^25.\n\n## Discussion\n\nWe have studied the effects of diffraction, atmospheric attenuation, detector\ninefficiency and turbulence on quantum signals propagating through free space,\nbetween a ground station and a satellite. More precisely, we have investigated\nthe effects of these loss mechanisms combined, and described as a fading\nquantum channel, acting on TMSV states, which are a paradigmatic example of\nentangled Gaussian quantum states. We have observed the degradation of\nentanglement through the negativity of the state, and looked at the fidelity\nof performing quantum teleportation with the remaining entangled resource,\nboth after downlink and uplink communications, and for satellites in different\norbits. We conclude that the best case occurs when we use a downlink, i.e.\nwhen the bipartite states are generated in the satellite and one of the modes\nis sent down to the ground station. Downlink quantum teleportation can be\nperformed in 400 km before reaching maximum classical fidelities. The uplink\nrepresents the worst case because turbulence effects, which are more drastic\ninside the atmosphere, distort the waist of the beam and displace the focusing\npoint; when considering the whole path, these errors have a higher impact on a\nbeam that is starting its path.\n\nWe have also considered the introduction of an intermediate station; we first\ninvestigated a scenario in which the states were generated there, and one mode\nwas then sent to the ground station through a downlink, while the other was\nsent to the satellite through an uplink. Considering that now the uplink does\nnot start inside the atmosphere, the results for the negativity were slightly\nbetter than those for the downlink in the simple case, provided an optimal\nplacement of the intermediate station. Furthermore, the results for the\nfidelity were highly improved because the generation of states in an\nintermediate station leads to states that are almost symmetric. As we discuss\nin section 'Intermediate station improvement', for two Gaussian states with\nthe same entanglement, the one that presents a more symmetric covariance\nmatrix will have a higher teleportation fidelity, in the well-known\nBraunstein-Kimble quantum teleportation protocol. This fidelity reaches the\nmaximum classical value for links going into the LEO region. The second\nintermediate-station scenario we considered was one were the beam could be\nrefocused, but in a simple downlink or uplink. The uplink showed a higher\nimprovement than the downlink, because a refocusing station can help mitigate\nthe combined effects of diffraction and turbulence, which as we discussed\nearlier, are more severe on more ideal beams.\n\nWe have followed by studying a similar free-space loss mechanism for microwave\nsignals, which are largely affected by diffraction and thermal noise. Although\natmospheric absorption and turbulence effects can be neglected, the distances\nfor entanglement distribution and effective quantum teleportation were highly\nreduced with respect to the optical case. In a bad weather scenario, we\nobserved that microwave and optical signals yield a similar performance for\nshort distances, microwaves then leading to worse results as we separate from\nthe source, mainly due to diffraction.\n\nWe have concluded by showing the limits of entanglement distribution and\nquantum teleportation through horizontal paths, in ground-to-ground scenarios,\nwhere turbulence effects are present, and inter-satellite quantum\ncommunication, where we have mostly diffraction and pointing errors. Between\nsatellites, the loss mechanism is reduced to diffraction and beam wandering,\nand therefore entanglement and quantum teleportation fidelity can be preserved\nfor longer distances than in horizontal paths between ground stations, where\natmospheric absorption and turbulence come into play.\n\nWe believe these results are relevant in the development of quantum\ncommunications in free space, establishing limits based on experimental\nparameters to the realizability of quantum information transfer between Earth\nand satellites. Provided that classical secure channels are well-established,\nthe installation of adequate quantum channels represents the next step towards\ndeveloping quantum communication networks, that can lead to advances such as\nthe quantum internet.\n\n## Methods\n\nWe sketch the general quantum communication scenario in Fig. 7. We consider\nthe combined effects of different loss mechanisms that apply to signals in the\noptical regime propagating through free space. These mechanisms have been\nidentified in previous works studying quantum communication links involving\nground stations and satellites^24,25,26.\n\nFig. 7: Quantum communication channel between a ground station and a\nsatellite.\n\nA Gaussian beam (shown in blue) is generated at the ground with an initial\nwaist \u03c0_0, and propagates a distance z through free space, where it suffers\nfrom diffraction and turbulence effects, as well as atmospheric absorption.\nThese mechanisms induce transmissivities \u03c4_st and \u03c4_atm, respectively. Apart\nfrom the broadening of the beam waist, \u03c0_st, caused by turbulence, we also\nhave wandering of the beam centroid, quantified by the distance q. The\nefficiency of the photodetectors is represented by the transmissivity \u03c4_eff.\nGiven the field of view, \u03a9_fov, there is a mean number of thermal photons n\ndetected by the receiver.\n\nFull size image\n\n### Diffraction\n\nWe consider the effects of diffraction in signals propagating through free\nspace. We assume a quasi-monochromatic bosonic mode represented by a Gaussian\nbeam with wavelength \u03bb, curvature radius of the wave-front R_0, and initial\nwaist \u03c0_0. For a focused beam, R_0 is equal to the distance between\ntransmitter and receiver, whereas for a collimated beam, it is set at\ninfinity. The receiver aperture is a_R, and \\\\({z}_{R}=\\pi {\\varpi\n}_{0}^{2}/\\lambda\\\\) is the Rayleigh range, such that the far-field regime is\ndefined by z \u226b z_R, for a transmission distance z.\n\nThe transmissivity induced by diffraction is given by\n\n$${\\tau }_{{{{{{{{\\rm{diff}}}}}}}}}=1-{e}^{-2{\\left({a}_{R}/{\\varpi\n}_{z}\\right)}^{2}},$$\n\n(17)\n\nwhere \u03c0_z is the waist of the beam at a distance z^39,\n\n$${\\varpi }_{z}^{2}={\\varpi\n}_{0}^{2}\\left[{\\left(1-\\frac{z}{{R}_{0}}\\right)}^{2}+{\\left(\\frac{z}{{z}_{R}}\\right)}^{2}\\right].$$\n\n(18)\n\nHere we will work with collimated beams, for which we have\n\n$${\\varpi }_{z}^{2}={\\varpi\n}_{0}^{2}\\left[1+{\\left(\\frac{z}{{z}_{R}}\\right)}^{2}\\right].$$\n\n(19)\n\nNotice that losses associated to diffraction will be larger when a_R \u226a \u03c0_z.\n\n### Atmospheric attenuation\n\nThe transmissivity affected by atmospheric attenuation of signals at a fixed\naltitude is given by\n\n$${\\tau }_{{{{{{{{\\rm{atm}}}}}}}}}=\\exp \\left[-{\\alpha\n}_{0}z{e}^{-h/\\tilde{h}}\\right],$$\n\n(20)\n\nwhere \u03b1_0 = N_0\u03c3 is the extinction factor, N_0 is the density of particles, \u03c3\n= \u03c3_abs + \u03c3_sca is the cross section associated with absorption and\nscattering, and \\\\(\\tilde{h}=6600\\\\) m is a scale factor^24. At sea level, and\nfor \u03bb = 800 nm, we have \u03b1_0 = 5 \u00d7 10^\u22126 m^\u22121. Naturally, this needs to be\nadapted to variable altitudes. For that, we will use\n\n$$z=\\sqrt{{\\left(\\Delta h\\right)}^{2}+2\\Delta hR+{R}^{2}{\\cos }^{2}\\theta\n}-R\\cos \\theta ,$$\n\n(21)\n\nwhere we have defined\n\n$$\\Delta h=h-{h}_{0}=\\sqrt{{R}^{2}+{z}^{2}+2zR\\cos \\theta }-R,$$\n\n(22)\n\n$$R={R}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{E}}}}}}}}}+{h}_{0},$$\n\n(23)\n\nconsidering h_0 to be negligible. Then, we can write\n\n$${\\tau }_{{{{{{{{\\rm{atm}}}}}}}}}={e}^{-{\\alpha }_{0}g(h,\\theta )},$$\n\n(24)\n\nwhere we have defined\n\n$$g(h,\\theta )=\\int\\nolimits_{0}^{z(h,\\theta )}\\,{{\\mbox{d}}}y{e}^{-h(y,\\theta\n)/\\tilde{h}}.$$\n\n(25)\n\n### Detector efficiency and thermal background\n\nAs another source of losses, we can consider that we may have inefficient\ndetectors. We will take, as the lowest value, \u03c4_eff = 0.4^23, whereas the\nmaximum possible one is \u03c4_eff = 1. We will refer to the latter as the ideal\ncase. Nevertheless, we consider that the signal traveling through the link\nwill acquire excess noise that will be caught in the detectors, characterized\nby a thermal state that introduces \u03c4_eff n thermal photons into our state.\nFurthermore, we consider that the effective number of thermal photons that the\nsignal acquires in the path is the one that can be effectively captured by the\ndetectors. We compute this using^26\n\n$${\\Gamma }_{R} = \\, \\Delta \\lambda \\Delta t{\\Omega\n}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{fov}}}}}}}}}{a}_{R}^{2},\\\\\\ {N}_{BB} = \\, 2c{\\lambda\n}^{-4}{\\left[{e}^{hc/(\\lambda {k}_{B}T)}-1\\right]}^{-1},\\\\\\ n = \\, {\\Gamma\n}_{R}{N}_{BB},$$\n\n(26)\n\nwhere \u0393_R is the photon collection parameter, \u0394t and \u0394\u03bb are the spectral\nfilter and the time bandwidth, respectively, \u03a9_fov is the field of view of the\nreceiver, and N_BB is the number of thermal photons, quantified by the black-\nbody formula, in units of \\\\({\\Gamma }_{R}^{-1}\\\\). Furthermore, c is the\nspeed of light, \u03bb is the wavelength of the signal, h is Planck\u2019s constant, k_B\nis Boltzmann\u2019s constant, T is the temperature, and finally n is the average\nthermal photon number.\n\nWe take \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm, \u0394t = 10 ns, \u03a9_fov = 10^\u221210 sr and a_R = 40 cm. Then, we are\nleft with average thermal-photon number\n\\\\({n}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{day}}}}}}}}}^{{{{{{{{\\rm{down}}}}}}}}}=0.30\\\\) and\n\\\\({n}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{night}}}}}}}}}^{{{{{{{{\\rm{down}}}}}}}}}=3.40\\times\n1{0}^{-6}\\\\) for a daytime and nighttime downlink, respectively, and\n\\\\({n}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{day}}}}}}}}}^{{{{{{{{\\rm{up}}}}}}}}}=0.22\\\\) and\n\\\\({n}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{night}}}}}}}}}^{{{{{{{{\\rm{up}}}}}}}}}=5.43\\times\n1{0}^{-7}\\\\) for a daytime and nighttime uplink, respectively.\n\n### Turbulence\n\nLet us now look at the effects of turbulence. We aim at working in the weak-\nturbulence regime, in which the effects of scintillation are ignored. This\nregime can be characterized using the spherical-wave coherence length,\n\n$${\\rho }_{0} = \\, {[1.46{k}^{2}{I}_{0}(z)]}^{-3/5},\\\\\\ {I}_{0}(z) = \\,\n\\int\\nolimits_{0}^{z}\\,{{\\mbox{d}}}\\,\\xi {\\left(1-\\frac{\\xi\n}{z}\\right)}^{5/3}{C}_{n}^{2}(h(\\xi ,\\theta ))$$\n\n(27)\n\nthrough the following formula\n\n$$z\\,\\lesssim \\,k{\\left(\\min \\\\{2{a}_{R},{\\rho }_{0}\\\\}\\right)}^{2},$$\n\n(28)\n\nfor a beam with wavenumber k = 2\u03c0/\u03bb, propagation distance z, and refraction\nindex structure constant \\\\({C}_{n}^{2}\\\\). The latter, in the Hufnagel-Valley\nmodel of atmospheric turbulence^40,41, reads\n\n$${C}_{n}^{2}= 5.94 \\times\n1{0}^{-53}{\\left(\\frac{v}{27}\\right)}^{2}{h}^{10}{e}^{-h/1000}\\\\\\ +\n\\,2.7\\times 1{0}^{-16}{e}^{-h/1500}+A{e}^{-h/100},$$\n\n(29)\n\nand it measures the strength of the fluctuations in the refraction index\ncaused by spatial variations of temperature and pressure. In this manuscript,\nwe consider v = 21 m s^\u22121 for the wind speed, and A_day(night) = 2.75(1.7) \u00d7\n10^\u221214 m^\u22122/3 for daytime (nighttime) values. At constant altitude, we see\nthat \\\\({\\rho }_{0}={(0.548{k}^{2}{C}_{n}^{2}z)}^{-3/5}\\\\). If we consider an\nuplink, we can use the above formula, but for a downlink, we need to\nsubstitute \u03be \u2192 z \u2212 \u03be in the structure constant.\n\nIn the weak-turbulence regime, we can distinguish between two error sources,\ncaused by the interaction of the beam with vortices, or eddies, of different\nsizes: beam broadening and beam wandering^19,20. Beam broadening is caused by\neddies smaller than the beam waist, and acts on a fast time scale. This will\nreplace \u03c0_z by some short-term waist \u03c0_st, leading to the modified\ndiffraction-induced transmissivity\n\n$${\\tau }_{{{{{{{{\\rm{st}}}}}}}}}=1-{e}^{-2{\\left({a}_{R}/{\\varpi\n}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{st}}}}}}}}}\\right)}^{2}}.$$\n\n(30)\n\nHere, we can write\n\n$${\\varpi }_{{{{{{{{\\rm{st}}}}}}}}}^{2}\\simeq {\\varpi\n}_{z}^{2}+2{\\left(\\frac{\\lambda z}{\\pi {\\rho }_{0}}\\right)}^{2}{(1-\\phi\n)}^{2},$$\n\n(31)\n\nwhere \\\\(\\phi =0.33{({\\rho }_{0}/{\\varpi }_{0})}^{1/3}\\\\). In the weak-\nturbulence regime, we find that \u03c6 \u226a 1, and thus we can approximate \\\\({(1-\\phi\n)}^{2}\\approx 1-0.66{({\\rho }_{0}/{\\varpi }_{0})}^{1/3}\\\\)^42.\n\nBeam wandering is caused by eddies larger than the beam waist, and act on a\nslow time scale. This causes the beam to deflect by randomly displacing its\ncenter, leading to a wandering of the waist. This random displacement will be\nassumed to follow a Gaussian probability distribution with variance \u03c3^2, which\nwill be composed of the large-scale turbulence \\\\({\\sigma\n}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{TB}}}}}}}}}^{2}\\\\) and the pointing error \\\\({\\sigma\n}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{P}}}}}}}}}^{2}\\\\) variances. The long-term waist of the beam can\nbe approximated by\n\n$${\\varpi }_{{{{{{{{\\rm{lt}}}}}}}}}^{2}\\simeq {\\varpi\n}_{z}^{2}+2{\\left(\\frac{\\lambda z}{\\pi {\\rho }_{0}}\\right)}^{2},$$\n\n(32)\n\nand it is related to its short-term counterpart through\n\n$${\\sigma }_{{{{{{{{\\rm{TB}}}}}}}}}^{2}={\\varpi\n}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{lt}}}}}}}}}^{2}-{\\varpi }_{{{{{{{{\\rm{st}}}}}}}}}^{2}\\simeq\n\\frac{0.1337{\\lambda }^{2}{z}^{2}}{{\\varpi }_{0}^{1/3}{\\rho }_{0}^{5/3}}.$$\n\n(33)\n\nThe beam centroid wanders with total variance \\\\({\\sigma }^{2}={\\sigma\n}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{TB}}}}}}}}}^{2}+{\\sigma }_{{{{{{{{\\rm{P}}}}}}}}}^{2}\\\\), and we\nwill take \u03c3_P = 10^\u22126z. We define q as the distance between the beam centroid\nand the original center (horizontally-aligned with the transmitter and the\nreceiver), also known as deflection. We assume that this value takes a\nGaussian random walk following the Weibull distribution^22\n\n$${P}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{WB}}}}}}}}}(q)=\\frac{q}{{\\sigma\n}^{2}}{e}^{-\\frac{{q}^{2}}{2{\\sigma }^{2}}}.$$\n\n(34)\n\nThen, the maximum value of the transmissivity occurs for q = 0,\n\n$${\\tau }_{\\max }=\\tau (q=0)={\\tau }_{{{{{{{{\\rm{st}}}}}}}}}(q=0){\\tau\n}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{atm}}}}}}}}}{\\tau }_{{{{{{{{\\rm{eff}}}}}}}}}.$$\n\n(35)\n\nHowever, for each instantaneous value of q, there will be an instantaneous\n\\\\(\\tau (q)\\le {\\tau }_{\\max }\\\\) happening with a probability P(\u03c4).

First, see that the Wigner function of the state\nthat results from applying the fading channel is\n\n$${W}^{{\\prime} }(x,p)=\\int\\nolimits_{0}^{{\\tau }_{\\max }}d\\tau P(\\tau\n){W}_{\\tau }(x,p).$$\n\n(41)\n\nHere, the Wigner function W_\u03c4(x, p) results from the modification of the\nquadrature operators \\\\(\\hat{x}\\\\) and \\\\(\\hat{p}\\\\) by the quantum channel\ninstance \u03b5_\u03c4,\n\n$$\\hat{x}\\to {\\hat{x}}_{\\tau }= \\sqrt{\\tau }\\hat{x}+\\sqrt{1-\\tau\n}{\\hat{x}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{e}}}}}}}}},\\\\\\ \\hat{p}\\to {\\hat{p}}_{\\tau }= \\sqrt{\\tau\n}\\hat{p}+\\sqrt{1-\\tau }{\\hat{p}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{e}}}}}}}}},$$\n\n(42)\n\nwhich get mixed with the quadrature operators of the state of an environment.\nIn this formalism, the expectation value of the operator \\\\(\\hat{A}\\hat{B}\\\\)\nis computed as\n\n$$\\langle \\hat{A}\\hat{B}\\rangle =\n\\int\\,\\,{{\\mbox{d}}}x{{\\mbox{d}}}pAB{W}^{{\\prime} }(x,p)\\\\\\ =\n\\int\\nolimits_{0}^{{\\tau }_{\\max }}d\\tau P(\\tau\n)\\int\\,\\,{{\\mbox{d}}}x{{\\mbox{d}}}pAB{W}_{\\tau }(x,p)\\\\\\ =\n\\int\\nolimits_{0}^{{\\tau }_{\\max }}d\\tau P(\\tau ){\\langle\n\\hat{A}\\hat{B}\\rangle }_{\\tau }.$$\n\n(43)\n\nThis result implies that we can replace the elements of the covariance matrix\nof the state resulting from the fading channel by the weighted integral of the\nexpectation values resulting from each channel instance^43,44. The later looks\nas follows, for the second moments of quadrature operators:\n\n$${\\hat{x}}^{2}\\to{\\hat{x}}_{\\tau }^{2}= \\tau {\\hat{x}}^{2}+(1-\\tau\n){\\hat{x}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{e}}}}}}}}}^{2}+\\sqrt{\\tau (1-\\tau\n)}\\\\{\\hat{x},{\\hat{x}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{e}}}}}}}}}\\\\},\\\\\\\n{\\hat{p}}^{2}\\to{\\hat{p}}_{\\tau }^{2}= \\tau {\\hat{p}}^{2}+(1-\\tau\n){\\hat{p}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{e}}}}}}}}}^{2}+\\sqrt{\\tau (1-\\tau\n)}\\\\{\\hat{p},{\\hat{p}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{e}}}}}}}}}\\\\},\\\\\\\n\\\\{\\hat{x},\\hat{p}\\\\}\\to\\\\{{\\hat{x}}_{\\tau },{\\hat{p}}_{\\tau }\\\\}= \\tau\n\\\\{\\hat{x},\\hat{p}\\\\}+(1-\\tau\n)\\\\{{\\hat{x}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{e}}}}}}}}},{\\hat{p}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{e}}}}}}}}}\\\\}\\\\\\\n+\\sqrt{\\tau (1-\\tau\n)}\\left(\\\\{\\hat{x},{\\hat{p}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{e}}}}}}}}}\\\\}+\\\\{\\hat{p},{\\hat{x}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{e}}}}}}}}}\\\\}\\right).$$\n\n(44)\n\nFor the complete fading channel, we will have to make the replacement\n\n$$\\begin{array}{rcl}\\tau &\\longrightarrow &\\langle \\tau \\rangle\n=\\int\\nolimits_{0}^{{\\tau }_{\\max }}d\\tau P(\\tau )\\tau ,\\\\\\ \\sqrt{\\tau\n}&\\longrightarrow &\\left\\langle \\sqrt{\\tau }\\right\\rangle\n=\\int\\nolimits_{0}^{{\\tau }_{\\max }}d\\tau P(\\tau )\\sqrt{\\tau }.\\end{array}$$\n\n(45)\n\n### Intermediate station improvement\n\nHere, we elaborate the discussion regarding the improvements that the\ngeneration of bipartite states at an intermediate station can bring, for\nGaussian states propagating through turbulent media. In Fig. 8, we present the\ndifferent negativities and fidelities, for fast and slow turbulence regimes.\nWe compare the case of a downlink, an uplink, and the combination required by\nan intermediate station, against the height of the link. We can observe in\nFig. 8a, b that the negativity, in the case of an intermediate station is\nlarger that a single dowlink/uplink, but only in the ideal case; when we\nconsider inefficient detectors (\u03c4_eff = 0.4), this gain is not so clear. As we\nincrease the height of the link, this gain is not significant with respect to\nthe downlink, although it remains relevant against the uplink. In Fig. 8c, d\nthe fidelity of teleporting an unknown coherent state is much better with an\nintermediate station, with respect to either a downlink or an uplink.\nEspecially, we can highlight its partial saturation at the maximum classical\nfidelity value.\n\nFig. 8: Ground-to-satellite uplink and downlink quantum communication\ncomparison with intermediate station, where these states are generated.\n\nWe study a signal of wavelength \u03bb = 800 nm and initial waist \u03c0_0 = 20 cm, in a\ntwo-mode squeezed vacuum state with squeezing parameter r = 1, sent to a\nreceiver that has an antenna of radius a_R = 40 cm, and that is subject to a\nloss mechanism composed of diffraction, atmospheric extinction, detector\ninefficiency and free-space turbulence, and described by a fading channel. In\na solid line, we plot the quantities associated to a downlink; those\ncorresponding to an uplink appear dashed, and the dashed-dotted lines describe\nthe case of an intermediate station. In full color we represent the results\nfor perfect detector efficiency, \u03c4_eff = 1, whereas imperfect detection, \u03c4_eff\n= 0.4, is marked by the transparent curves. Negativity of the state after the\nfading channel in the slow-turbulence and fast-detection regime (a), and in\nthe fast-turbulence and slow-detection regime (b), against the height of the\ncomplete link. The average fidelity of teleporting an unknown coherent state,\nusing the entangled states that result from the fading process, in the slow-\nturbulence and fast-detection regime (c), and in the fast-turbulence and slow-\ndetection regime (d), against the height of the complete link.\n\nFull size image\n\nWe observe that the transmissivity in the case of the intermediate station is\nonly higher than that of the downlink in the ideal case; when we have\nimperfect detectors, since there are now two detection events, the\ntransmissivity is always worse. This can be observed in Fig. 9a, where we\nrepresent the transmissivity induced by downlink, uplink, and intermediate-\nstation scenarios. Notice that in Fig. 4c the optimal location of the\nintermediate lens is very similar to the optimal position of the intermediate\nstation in Fig. 9b. This emphasizes the statement that an intermediate station\nand an intermediate lens contribute about equally to improving the\ntransmissivity of the downlink.\n\nFig. 9: Transmissivity comparison between ground-to-satellite uplink and\ndownlink and intermediate station quantum communication.\n\na Average transmissivity of a fading channel modelling a loss mechanism\npresent in a link connecting a ground station and a satellite, and composed of\ndiffraction, atmospheric extinction, detector inefficiency and free-space\nturbulence. In a solid line, we plot the quantities associated to a downlink;\nthose corresponding to an uplink appear dashed, and the dashed-dotted lines\ndescribe the case of an intermediate station. In full color we represent the\nresults for perfect detector efficiency, \u03c4_eff = 1, whereas imperfect\ndetection, \u03c4_eff = 0.4, is marked by the high-transparency curves. In blue, we\nrepresent the result associated with nighttime thermal noise, whereas those\nassociated to daytime thermal noise appear in red. b Optimal positions of the\nintermediate station, in order to maximize the transmissivity, against the\nheight of the link.\n\nFull size image\n\nWe consider nighttime and daytime noise, again seeing that transmissivities\nassociated to downlink and intermediate-station communication coincide. The\nsame thing happens in Fig. 8. Although we can see this behavior in the\nnegativity plots, the fidelity behaves different. This is because the state is\nmore symmetric in the case of the intermediate station, and this improves the\nteleportation fidelity, such that for a perfectly symmetric state, the\nteleportation fidelity if \\\\(\\overline{F}=1/(1+{\\tilde{\\nu }}_{-})\\\\), given a\npartially-transposed symplectic eigenvalue \\\\({\\tilde{\\nu }}_{-}\\\\) that\ncompletely characterizes the negativity.\n\nTake a covariance matrix like the one in Eq. (3), assuming it represents an\nasymmetric state. Here, we are referring to symmetry in the second moments of\nmodes A and B, and not in the sense that the covariance matrix is symmetric.\nThe partially-transposed symplectic eigenvalue is\n\n$${\\tilde{\\nu }}_{-}^{{{{{{{{\\rm{A}}}}}}}}}=\\frac{\\alpha +\\beta\n-\\sqrt{{(\\alpha -\\beta )}^{2}+4{\\gamma }^{2}}}{2}$$\n\n(46)\n\nand the teleportation fidelity is\n\n$${\\overline{F}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{A}}}}}}}}}=\\frac{1}{1+(\\alpha +\\beta -2\\gamma\n)/2}.$$\n\n(47)\n\nFor a symmetric Gaussian state with covariance matrix\n\n$${\\Sigma }_{{{{{{{{\\rm{S}}}}}}}}}=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\\delta\n{{\\mathbb{1}}}_{2}&\\varepsilon Z\\\\\\ \\varepsilon Z&\\delta\n{{\\mathbb{1}}}_{2}\\end{array}\\right),$$\n\n(48)\n\nthe partially-transpose symplectic eigenvalue is\n\n$${\\tilde{\\nu }}_{-}^{{{{{{{{\\rm{S}}}}}}}}}=\\delta -\\varepsilon$$\n\n(49)\n\nand the teleportation fidelity is\n\n$${\\overline{F}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{S}}}}}}}}}=\\frac{1}{1+\\delta -\\varepsilon }.$$\n\n(50)\n\nIf these two states have the same negativity, then\n\n$$\\frac{\\alpha +\\beta -\\sqrt{{(\\alpha -\\beta )}^{2}+4{\\gamma }^{2}}}{2}=\\delta\n-\\varepsilon ,$$\n\n(51)\n\nand we can write\n\n$${\\overline{F}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{S}}}}}}}}}=\\frac{1}{1+\\frac{\\alpha +\\beta\n-\\sqrt{{(\\alpha -\\beta )}^{2}+4{\\gamma }^{2}}}{2}}.$$\n\n(52)\n\nClaiming that the fidelity with the symmetric state is higher than that with\nthe asymmetric state amounts to checking that\n\n$$\\alpha +\\beta -\\sqrt{{(\\alpha -\\beta )}^{2}+4{\\gamma }^{2}} < \\alpha +\\beta\n-2\\gamma ,$$\n\n(53)\n\nand this is always true for \u03b1 \u2260 \u03b2. This statement works for a perfectly\nsymmetric state, but we can write an extension for more general covariance\nmatrices. We take\n\n$${\\Sigma }_{1}=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}{\\alpha }_{1}{{\\mathbb{1}}}_{2}&{\\gamma\n}_{1}Z\\\\\\ {\\gamma }_{1}Z&{\\beta\n}_{1}{{\\mathbb{1}}}_{2}\\end{array}\\right),\\qquad {\\Sigma\n}_{2}=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}{\\alpha }_{2}{{\\mathbb{1}}}_{2}&{\\gamma }_{2}Z\\\\\\\n{\\gamma }_{2}Z&{\\beta }_{2}{{\\mathbb{1}}}_{2}\\end{array}\\right),$$\n\n(54)\n\nand assume that \u03b1_i > \u03b2_i (i \u2208 {1, 2}) for convenience, and expand up to first\norder in \u03b1_i \u2212 \u03b2_i \u226a 1. We can say that, if the states represented by these\ntwo covariance matrices have the same negativity, then state 1 shows higher\nteleportation fidelity for an unknown coherent state if\n\n$${\\alpha }_{1}-{\\beta }_{1} < \\sqrt{\\frac{{\\gamma }_{1}}{{\\gamma\n}_{2}}}\\,({\\alpha }_{2}-{\\beta }_{2}).$$\n\n(55)\n\nThis also works the other way around; for two states with the same\nteleportation fidelity, state 1 shows lower entanglement if its covariance\nmatrix elements satisfy the above condition. Furthermore, we could fix \u03b3_1 =\n\u03b3_2 = \u03b3, and see that for higher orders of the expansion \u03b1_i \u2212 \u03b2_i \u226a 1, we\nobtain that \u03b1_1 \u2212 \u03b2_1 < \u03b1_2 \u2212 \u03b2_2 if\n\n$$\\sqrt{{({\\alpha }_{1}-{\\beta }_{1})}^{2}+{({\\alpha }_{2}-{\\beta }_{2})}^{2}}\n< 4\\gamma$$\n\n(56)\n\nis satisfied.\n\n### Microwaves versus optics\n\nWe characterize losses for microwave signals through diffraction, atmospheric\nattenuation, and detector inefficiency. With the diffraction-induced\ntransmissivity given in Eq. (17), and assuming ideal detector efficiency \u03c4_eff\n= 1, we describe the absorption-induced transmissivity along a slant path of\nzenit angle \u03b8, starting at altitude h_0 and ending at h by\n\n$${\\tau }_{{{{{{{{\\rm{atm}}}}}}}}}=\\exp \\left[-\\sec \\theta\n\\int\\nolimits_{{h}_{0}}^{h}\\,{{\\mbox{d}}}\\,{h}^{{\\prime} }\\alpha\n({h}^{{\\prime} })\\right].$$\n\n(57)\n\nthe atmospheric absorption coefficient \\\\(\\alpha ({h}^{{\\prime} })={\\alpha\n}_{o}+{\\alpha }_{w}({h}^{{\\prime} })\\\\) represents the combined attenuation\ndue to oxygen and water vapor. The former can be considered constant inside\nthe atmosphere, but the latter will depend on the variation of the water\nconcentration with the altitude. The specific coefficients are^45\n\n$${\\alpha }_{o}= 1.44\\times 1{0}^{-3}\\,{{{\\mbox{km}}}}^{-1},\\\\\\ {\\alpha\n}_{w}({h}^{{\\prime} })= 4.44\\times 1{0}^{-5}{p}_{0}{e}^{-\\frac{{h}^{{\\prime}\n}}{2}}\\,{{{\\mbox{km}}}}^{-1},$$\n\nwhere p_0 is the water-vapor density, whose average ground value is 7.5 g\nm^\u22123, at 5 GHz. These frequencies present one of the lowest attenuation\nprofiles among microwaves^46, and therefore make them suitable for\ntelecommunications independent of the weather conditions. However, the main\nsources of loss for microwave signals are diffraction and the thermal\nbackground.\n\nWe can reduce the effects of thermal noise if we assume that we know the time\nof arrival of the signal, and therefore by using Eq. (26). The limits for\nshort-range microwave quantum key distribution have been studied^47 using as\nparameters \u0394 t \u0394 \u03bd \u2243 1. This lead to \\\\({\\Gamma }_{R}\\simeq {\\lambda\n}^{2}{\\Omega }_{{{{{{{{\\rm{fov}}}}}}}}}{a}_{R}^{2}/c\\\\) and, by taking \u03bb = 6\ncm, \u03a9_fov = 10^\u22124 sr and a_R = 2 m, the number effective number of thermal\nphotons becomes n \u2243 266 at 288 K.\n\nWe compare microwave to optical signals in adverse weather conditions. To\naccount for the effects of rain on atmospheric attenuation and visibility on\nthe latter, we set \u03b1_0 = 3.4 \u00d7 10^\u22124 m^\u22121^48 and, in the Hufnagel-Valley\nturbulence model, we now write A_day(night) = 3.15(2.15) \u00d7 10^\u221214 m^\u22122/3^23.\nIn the microwave regime, we need to set the water-vapor density to p_0 = 12 g\nm^\u22123^45.\n\n### Horizontal paths\n\nWe consider two scenarios, in which TMSV states are distributed between two\nground stations, and between two satellites, respectively, each station or\nsatellite having an receiving antenna with a_R = 5 cm of aperture radius, and\nable to generate quasi-monochromatic beams with wavelength \u03bb = 800 nm and \u03c0_0\n= 5 cm of initial waist.\n\nIn ground-to-ground, since the altitude is fixed at h = 30 m, and for a wind\nspeed of v = 21 m s^\u22121, the refraction index structure constant is\n\\\\({C}_{n}^{2}=2.06(1.29)\\times 1{0}^{-14}\\,{{{\\mbox{m}}}}^{-2/3}\\\\) for\ndaytime (nighttime) values. We characterize the excess noise in the detectors\nby n_day = 4.75 \u00d7 10^\u22123 thermal photons for daytime events, and n_night = 4.75\n\u00d7 10^\u22128 thermal photons for nighttime events.\n\nIn the case of satellite-to-satellite, the number of environmental thermal\nphotons is n = 8.48 \u00d7 10^\u22129. Since we are considering that the refraction\nindex structure constant is negligible outside the atmosphere, we do not need\nto specify the altitude.\n\n## Data availability\n\nAll data in this paper can be reproduced by using the methodology described.\n\n## Code availability\n\nThe code used in this study is available from the corresponding author upon\nreasonable request.\n\n## References\n\n  1.
