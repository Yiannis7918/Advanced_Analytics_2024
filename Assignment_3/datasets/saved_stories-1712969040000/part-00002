Was it\nPresident Boris Yeltsin, with his October 1993 decision to crush opponents by\nforce, his pushing of an executive-dominated constitution, and his disastrous\nchoice of Vladimir Putin as his successor? Had Yeltsin selected someone else,\nmight things be different today?\n\nThe answer, I am afraid, is not to be found in something as contingent as bad\nleadership. The question \u201cWho lost Russia?\u201d is meaningless because Russia,\nfrom the point of view of democracy, was never truly \u201cgained.\u201d The Soviet\nUnion broke up in 1991, but no real democratic transition took place. Instead,\nthe former communist system remained in place, with only a few outward\nappearances shifting: the old Soviet wolf in new clothing. The Soviet-era\nruling groups and institutions largely survived at the top of Russian\npolitics. One exception was\u2014or should have been\u2014the market economy, but even\nthere, old elites seized for themselves the most lucrative assets and\npositions. The eventual re-autocratization of Russia was just a matter of\ntime.\n\nThe temporary weakening of an authoritarian regime may sometimes be conflated\nwith a democratic transition. A transition, however, requires fundamental,\nsystemic changes in a given polity. Most authoritarian breakdowns do not bring\nabout democratization but lead instead to a new authoritarian regime or state\ncollapse and anarchy.\n\n## Read More\n\nFull article available via the Journal of Democracy.\n\nread full article\n\n## Maria Snegovaya\n\nSenior Fellow, Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program, Center for Strategic and\nInternational Studies; Postdoctoral Fellow, Georgetown University's Walsh\nSchool of Foreign Service\n\nMaria Snegovaya is a postdoctoral fellow at the Walsh School of Foreign\nService, Georgetown University, and a senior fellow at CSIS.\n\nRead more\n\nImage\n\nSubscribe to the Davis Center Newsletter\n\nBe the first to know about events, programs, and news.\n\nSign Up\n\nKathryn W. and Shelby Cullom Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies\n\nHarvard University 1730 Cambridge Street, 3rd Floor Cambridge, MA 02138\n\n+1.617.495.4037\n\nContact Us\n\n\u00a92024 President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Youtube Channel\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n\n", "frontpage": true}
