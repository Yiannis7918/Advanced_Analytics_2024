The country\u2019s sophisticated multi-layered air defence system was\nexpected to be able to intercept relatively slow-moving drones, although it\ncould be overwhelmed by large volumes of incoming fire.\n\nThere has been nearly two weeks of speculation about when, where and how\nTehran or its proxy forces would respond to the 1 April strike on an Iranian\ndiplomatic building in the Syrian capital of Damascus which killed Gen\nMohammad Reza Zahedi, a senior figure in Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards,\nand eight other officers.\n\nIsraeli officials almost never claim responsibility for attacks carried out on\nforeign soil. Tehran has blamed Israel for the strike.\n\nIran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has repeatedly promised to\nrespond against Israel over the attack, while Israeli officials have warned\nseveral times that the country\u2019s forces would strike Iran directly if it\nlaunched any retaliatory action from its territory, raising fears over what is\nnow a rapidly escalating tit-for-tat.\n\nOn Saturday, Israel\u2019s armed forces were on full alert, and an announcement was\nmade that schools will be closed for the next two days. Israeli, Lebanese,\nIraqi, Jordanian and Iranian airspace have been closed. Neighbouring Jordan\nhas declared a state of emergency.\n\nThere were unconfirmed reports overnight that US, UK and Jordanian planes had\nbeen mobilised to intercept the Iranian attack. Iran\u2019s defence minister,\nMohammad Reza Ashtiani, told state TV in response that \u201cany country that\nallows its airspace or soil to be used for Israel to attack Iran will receive\na firm response from us\u201d.\n\nIsrael has attacked scores of Iranian-linked targets in Syria during the\n14-year-old civil war there with the apparent intent of disrupting arms\ntransfers and other cooperation with Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah, which is backed by\nIran.\n\nSince the war in Gaza began six months ago, there have been near-daily\nexchanges of fire between Israeli forces and Hezbollah along the Israel-\nLebanon border that have threatened to escalate into full-blown conflict.\n\nA direct attack by Iran on Israel, however, was not believed to be on the\ncards: Tehran\u2019s leaders have previously made clear that they are not seeking a\nwar with Israel, which could also draw in the US.\n\nIran has never responded with such force to previous attacks, including many\ncovert Israeli operations on its soil, or the US assassination of the powerful\nQuds Force leader Qassem Soleimani in Iraq in 2020.\n\nUS president Joe Biden cut short a weekend stay at his Delaware beach house\nand returned to the White House to meet his national security team and monitor\nthe situation shortly before the attack was announced.\n\nThe US leader, who this week reiterated Washington\u2019s \u201ciron-clad\u201d commitment to\nthe security of Israel, its most important Middle Eastern ally, was being\nregularly updated and was in constant communication with Israeli officials as\nwell as US partners and allies, National Security Council spokesperson\nAdrienne Watson said in a statement late on Saturday.\n\nThe latest war between Israel and Hamas, sparked by the Palestinian militant\ngroup\u2019s 7 October attack in which 1,200 were killed and another 250 abducted,\nhas already spread to fronts with Lebanon and Syria and drawn long-range fire\nat Israeli targets from as far away as Yemen and Iraq.\n\nMore than 33,000 people have been killed in Israel\u2019s retaliatory offensive in\nGaza, where the 2.3m population is facing a dire humanitarian crisis and some\nareas have slipped into famine.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, Iran\u2019s state-run IRNA news agency reported that a IRGC\nhelicopter had boarded and taken into Iranian waters the Portuguese-flagged\nMSC Aries.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Iran\n  * Israel\n  * Middle East and north Africa\n  * Joe Biden\n  * US foreign policy\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### Iran launches drone attack against Israel as Biden rushes to White House\n\n36m ago\n\n  * ### \n\nLive\n\nIran has launched more than 100 drones in attack on Israel, says IDF \u2013 live\n\n5m ago\n\n  * ### Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards seize Israeli-affiliated ship\n\n10h ago\n\n  * ### Iran\u2019s silence over possible reprisals against Israel poses domestic risks\n\n9h ago\n\n  * ### World waits anxiously for Iranian response to Israel\u2019s killing of top general\n\n4h ago\n\n  * ### The new world disorder: how the Gaza war disrupted international relations\n\n6 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### West won\u2019t stop Houthi attacks unless it works with Yemeni authorities, say experts\n\n11 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### Edward Said seems like a prophet: 20 years on, \u2018there\u2019s hunger for his narrative\u2019\n\n15 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### Baghdad mourners gather for funeral of Iraqi militant killed in US drone strike\n\n9 Feb 2024\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
