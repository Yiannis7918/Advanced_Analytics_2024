Specifically:\n\n  * Building a 2D/3D hybrid app\n  * Creating a VR app to render 2D interactive windows without an engine\n  * Using VR layers to get sharp, crisp text and visuals.\n\nA Quest-native (i.e. OpenXR, without a third-party game engine) port of the\nCitra 3DS emulator Seemed like a great and fun way to demonstrate all these\nthings at once.\n\nThe project is still small, but I'm looking for ways to improve it as time\ngoes on.\n\n## Features\n\n  * Stereoscopic rendering\n  * Broad controller support\n  * Large, moveable/resizeable screen\n  * Playable in mixed reality\n  * Low-overhead port\n  * Fully GPL-licensed, 100% independent of the Meta SDK\n\n## Compatibillty\n\n### HMDs\n\nCitraVR supports the following devices:\n\n  * Meta Quest 2\n  * Meta Quest Pro\n  * Meta Quest 3\n\n### Games\n\nFor a full list of games that work well on CitraVR, please visit the CitraVR\nGame Compatability List\n\n### Controllers/Input\n\nTouch Controller Input Bindings Diagram\n\nFor games that need access to more inputs, or if a player needs to access more\ninputs faster, CitraVR also supports a multitude of 3rd party wired USB and\nwireless bluetooth controllers.\n\n## Releases\n\nGrab the latest release here\n\n## Known Issues\n\nSee the CitraVR Known Issues\n\n## How to Install and Run\n\n  * How to install and run CitraVR on Quest\n  * How to back up 3DS Games\n\n## Building\n\nBuilding for Quest\n\n## Discord\n\nJoin the Flat2VR discord and from there join cvr-join to get access to the\nCitraVR community and support forums\n\n# Need Help?\n\nPlease check our Troubleshooting and Known Issues pages to see if your issue\nis listed. To file a bug report or a feature request, please submit an issue.\nOtherwise, follow the instructions for Discord and post in cvr-support\n\n## Support\n\nBuy me a beer\n\nYou can also buy the original (non-VR) Citra project a beer\n\n## License\n\nCitraVR is licensed under the GPLv3 (or any later version).
