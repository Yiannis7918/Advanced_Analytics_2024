Russia tops\nthe list, followed by Ukraine, China, the USA, Nigeria, and Romania. The UK\ncomes in at number eight.\n\nLeft: Dr Miranda Bruce. Right: Associate Professor Jonathan Lusthaus.\n\nCo-author of the study, Dr Miranda Bruce from the University of Oxford and\nUNSW Canberra said the study will enable the public and private sectors to\nfocus their resources on key cybercrime hubs and spend less time and funds on\ncybercrime countermeasures in countries where the problem is not as\nsignificant.\n\n\u2018The research that underpins the Index will help remove the veil of anonymity\naround cybercriminal offenders, and we hope that it will aid the fight against\nthe growing threat of profit-driven cybercrime,\u2019 Dr Bruce said.\n\n\u2018We now have a deeper understanding of the geography of cybercrime, and how\ndifferent countries specialise in different types of cybercrime.\u2019\n\n\u2018By continuing to collect this data, we\u2019ll be able to monitor the emergence of\nany new hotspots and it is possible early interventions could be made in at-\nrisk countries before a serious cybercrime problem even develops.\u2019\n\nThe data that underpins the Index was gathered through a survey of 92 leading\ncybercrime experts from around the world who are involved in cybercrime\nintelligence gathering and investigations. The survey asked the experts to\nconsider five major categories of cybercrime*, nominate the countries that\nthey consider to be the most significant sources of each of these types of\ncybercrime, and then rank each country according to the impact,\nprofessionalism, and technical skill of its cybercriminals.\n\nCountries ranked by their World Cybercrime Index (WCI) score, according to the\nstudy.

They are actively hiding. If\nyou try to use technical data to map their location, you will also fail, as\ncybercriminals bounce their attacks around internet infrastructure across the\nworld. The best means we have to draw a picture of where these offenders are\nactually located is to survey those whose job it is to track these people,' Dr\nLusthaus said.\n\n> Figuring out why some countries are cybercrime hotspots, and others aren't,\n> is the next stage of the research. There are existing theories about why\n> some countries have become hubs of cybercriminal activity - for example,\n> that a technically skilled workforce with few employment opportunities may\n> turn to illicit activity to make ends meet - which we'll be able to test\n> against our global data set.\n>\n> Dr Miranda Bruce Department of Sociology, University of Oxford and UNSW\n> Canberra\n\nCo-author of the study, Professor Federico Varese from Sciences Po in France,\nsaid the World Cybercrime Index is the first step in a broader aim to\nunderstand the local dimensions of cybercrime production across the world.\n\n\u2018We are hoping to expand the study so that we can determine whether national\ncharacteristics like educational attainment, internet penetration, GDP, or\nlevels of corruption are associated with cybercrime. Many people think that\ncybercrime is global and fluid, but this study supports the view that, much\nlike forms of organised crime, it is embedded within particular contexts,\u2019\nProfessor Varese said.\n\nThe World Cybercrime Index has been developed as a joint partnership between\nthe University of Oxford and UNSW and has also been funded by CRIMGOV, a\nEuropean Union-supported project based at the University of Oxford and\nSciences Po. The other co-authors of the study include Professor Ridhi Kashyap\nfrom the University of Oxford and Professor Nigel Phair from Monash\nUniversity.\n\nThe study \u2018Mapping the global geography of cybercrime with the World\nCybercrime Index\u2019 has been published in the journal PLOS ONE.\n\n*The five major categories of cybercrime assessed by the study were:\n\n1\\. Technical products/services (e.g. malware coding, botnet access, access to\ncompromised systems, tool production).\n\n2\\. Attacks and extortion (e.g. denial-of-service attacks, ransomware).\n\n3\\. Data/identity theft (e.g. hacking, phishing, account compromises, credit\ncard comprises).\n\n4\\. Scams (e.g. advance fee fraud, business email compromise, online auction\nfraud).\n\n5\\. Cashing out/money laundering (e.g. credit card fraud, money mules, illicit\nvirtual currency platforms).\n\n.\n\nPublished\n\n10 Apr 2024\n\n## Share This\n\nTweet\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\nShare on Reddit\n\n## Latest\n\n  * Four \u2018outstanding research leaders\u2019 at Oxford awarded major European Research Council grants\n\n12 Apr 2024\n\n  * Study improves understanding of effects of household air pollution during pregnancy\n\n12 Apr 2024\n\n  * Breakthrough promises secure quantum computing at home\n\n11 Apr 2024\n\n  * World-first \u201cCybercrime Index\u201d ranks countries by cybercrime threat level\n\n10 Apr 2024\n\n  * Oxford start-up Onfido sale signals largest ever student-led company return on investment\n\n9 Apr 2024\n\nMore in Oxford\n\nWhy we need philosophy and ethics of cyber warfare\n\n16 Jun 2022\n\nKnowledge under attack: Bodleian\u2019s chief librarian turns cyber campaigner\n\n22 Oct 2020\n\nCybercriminals are not as anonymous as we think\n\n8 Aug 2017\n\n## DISCOVER MORE\n\n  * Support Oxford's research\n  * Partner with Oxford on research\n  * Study at Oxford\n  * Research jobs at Oxford\n\n## ALL NEWS\n\nYou can view all news or browse by category\n\nAll news\n\nMedia coverage\n\nMailOnline: Revealed: The countries with the highest levels of cybercrime in\nthe world\n\nThe Independent: Russia ranked top of global cybercrime index in new study\n\n## Share This\n\nTweet\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\nShare on Reddit\n\n## Connect with us\n\n  * Podcasts\n  * YouTube\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * TikTok\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Weibo\n  * Instagram\n  * Medium\n  * The Conversation\n\n## Information About\n\n  * Oxford University\n  * Strategic plan\n  * Oxford's research\n  * Course fees and funding\n  * Libraries\n  * Museums and collections\n  * Open days\n  * Oxford glossary\n  * Freedom of speech statement\n  * Statement on Modern Slavery\n  * Data privacy / GDPR\n  * Sport at Oxford\n  * Conferences at Oxford\n  * \u725b\u6d25\u5927\u5b66\n\n## Information For\n\n  * Prospective undergraduates\n  * Prospective graduate students\n  * Prospective Continuing Education students\n  * Prospective online/distance learning students\n  * Current Oxford students\n  * Current Oxford staff\n  * Oxford residents/Community\n  * Visitors/Tourists\n  * Media\n  * Alumni\n  * Teachers\n  * Parliamentarians\n  * Businesses/Partnerships\n\n## Quick Links\n\n  * Any questions?\n  * Jobs and vacancies\n  * Term dates\n  * Map\n  * Nexus365 email\n  * Giving to Oxford\n\n  * \u00a9 University of Oxford 2024\n  * Contact us\n  * About this site\n  * Legal\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie settings\n  * Accessibility Statement\n\n", "frontpage": false}
