They\nare called \"heuristics\" because they are broad rules of thumb and not specific\nusability guidelines.\n\nThank you to Kelley Gordon for designing the visuals and posters included in\nthis article.\n\nThank you to Kate Moran and Feifei Liu for updating the heuristic names,\ndescriptions, and examples.\n\n## In This Article:\n\n1: Visibility of System Status\n\n  * 1: Visibility of System Status\n  * 2: Match Between the System and the Real World\n  * 3: User Control and Freedom\n  * 4: Consistency and Standards\n  * 5: Error Prevention\n  * 6: Recognition Rather than Recall\n  * 7: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use\n  * 8: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design\n  * 9: Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors\n  * 10: Help and Documentation\n  * Free 10 Heuristics Poster\n\n## 1: Visibility of System Status\n\nThe design should always keep users informed about what is going on, through\nappropriate feedback within a reasonable amount of time.\n\nWhen users know the current system status, they learn the outcome of their\nprior interactions and determine next steps. Predictable interactions create\ntrust in the product as well as the brand.\n\nExample of Usability Heuristic #1: You Are Here indicators on mall maps show\npeople where they currently are, to help them understand where to go next.\n\nTips\n\n  * Communicate clearly to users what the system\u2019s state is \u2014 no action with consequences to users should be taken without informing them.\n  * Present feedback to the user as quickly as possible (ideally, immediately).\n  * Build trust through open and continuous communication.\n\nLearn more\n\n  * Full article: Visibility of System Status\n  * 3-minute video about the Visibility Heuristic\n\n## 2: Match Between the System and the Real World\n\nThe design should speak the users' language. Use words, phrases, and concepts\nfamiliar to the user, rather than internal jargon. Follow real-world\nconventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.\n\nThe way you should design depends very much on your specific users. Terms,\nconcepts, icons, and images that seem perfectly clear to you and your\ncolleagues may be unfamiliar or confusing to your users.\n\nWhen a design\u2019s controls follow real-world conventions and correspond to\ndesired outcomes (called natural mapping), it\u2019s easier for users to learn and\nremember how the interface works. This helps to build an experience that feels\nintuitive.\n\nExample of Usability Heuristic #2: When stovetop controls match the layout of\nheating elements, users can quickly understand which control maps to which\nheating element.\n\nTips\n\n  * Ensure that users can understand meaning without having to go look up a word\u2019s definition.\n  * Never assume your understanding of words or concepts will match that of your users.\n  * User research will uncover your users' familiar terminology, as well as their mental models around important concepts.\n\nLearn more\n\n  * Full article: Match Between the System and the Real World\n  * 2-minute video: Match Between the System and the Real World\n\n## 3: User Control and Freedom\n\nUsers often perform actions by mistake. They need a clearly marked \"emergency\nexit\" to leave the unwanted action without having to go through an extended\nprocess.\n\nWhen it's easy for people to back out of a process or undo an action, it\nfosters a sense of freedom and confidence. Exits allow users to remain in\ncontrol of the system and avoid getting stuck and feeling frustrated.\n\nExample of Usability Heuristic #3: Digital spaces need quick emergency exits,\njust like physical spaces do.\n\nTips\n\n  * Support Undo and Redo.\n  * Show a clear way to exit the current interaction, like a Cancel button.\n  * Make sure the exit is clearly labeled and discoverable.\n\nLearn more\n\n  * Full article: User Control and Freedom\n  * 2-minute video: User Control and Freedom\n\n## 4: Consistency and Standards\n\nUsers should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or\nactions mean the same thing. Follow platform and industry conventions.\n\nJakob's Law states that people spend most of their time using digital products\nother than yours. Users\u2019 experiences with those other products set their\nexpectations. Failing to maintain consistency may increase the users'\ncognitive load by forcing them to learn something new.\n\nExample of Usability Heuristic #4: Checkin counters are usually located at the\nfront of hotels. This consistency meets customers\u2019 expectations.\n\nTips\n\n  * Improve learnability by maintaining both types of consistency: internal and external.\n  * Maintain consistency within a single product or a family of products (internal consistency).\n  * Follow established industry conventions (external consistency).\n\nLearn more\n\n  * Full article: Consistency and Standards\n  * 3-minute video: Consistency and Standards\n\n## 5: Error Prevention\n\nGood error messages are important, but the best designs carefully prevent\nproblems from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone\nconditions, or check for them and present users with a confirmation option\nbefore they commit to the action.\n\nThere are two types of errors: slips and mistakes. Slips are unconscious\nerrors caused by inattention. Mistakes are conscious errors based on a\nmismatch between the user\u2019s mental model and the design.\n\nExample of Usability Heuristic #5: Guard rails on curvy mountain roads prevent\ndrivers from falling off cliffs.\n\nTips\n\n  * Prioritize your effort: Prevent high-cost errors first, then little frustrations.\n  * Avoid slips by providing helpful constraints and good defaults.\n  * Prevent mistakes by removing memory burdens, supporting undo, and warning your users.\n\nLearn more\n\n  * Full article: Preventing User Errors\n  * 3-minute video: Error Prevention\n\n## 6: Recognition Rather than Recall\n\nMinimize the user's memory load by making elements, actions, and options\nvisible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the\ninterface to another. Information required to use the design (e.g. field\nlabels or menu items) should be visible or easily retrievable when needed.\n\nHumans have limited short-term memories. Interfaces that promote recognition\nreduce the amount of cognitive effort required from users.\n\nExample of Usability Heuristic #6: It\u2019s easier for most people to recognize\nthe capitals of countries, instead of having to remember them. People are more\nlikely to correctly answer the question Is Lisbon the capital of Portugal?\nrather than What\u2019s the capital of Portugal?\n\nTips\n\n  * Let people recognize information in the interface, rather than forcing them to remember (\u201crecall\u201d) it.\n  * Offer help in context, instead of giving users a long tutorial to memorize.\n  * Reduce the information that users have to remember.\n\nLearn more\n\n  * Full article: Recognition vs. Recall in UX\n  * 3-minute video: Recognition vs. Recall\n\n## 7: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use\n\nShortcuts \u2014 hidden from novice users \u2014 may speed up the interaction for the\nexpert user so that the design can cater to both inexperienced and experienced\nusers. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.\n\nFlexible processes can be carried out in different ways, so that people can\npick whichever method works for them.\n\nExample of Usability Heuristic #7: Regular routes are listed on maps, but\nlocals with knowledge of the area can take shortcuts.\n\nTips\n\n  * Provide accelerators like keyboard shortcuts and touch gestures.\n  * Provide personalization by tailoring content and functionality for individual users.\n  * Allow for customization, so users can make selections about how they want the product to work.\n\nLearn more\n\n  * Full article: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use: The 7th Usability Heuristic Explained\n  * 3-minute video: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use\n\n## 8: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design\n\nInterfaces should not contain information that is irrelevant or rarely needed.\nEvery extra unit of information in an interface competes with the relevant\nunits of information and diminishes their relative visibility.\n\nThis heuristic doesn't mean you have to use a flat design \u2014 it's about making\nsure you're keeping the content and visual design focused on the essentials.\nEnsure that the visual elements of the interface support the user's primary\ngoals.\n\nExample of Usability Heuristic #8: An ornate teapot may have excessive\ndecorative elements, like an uncomfortable handle or hard-to-wash nozzle, that\ncan interfere with usability.\n\nTips\n\n  * Keep the content and visual design of UI focused on the essentials.\n  * Don't let unnecessary elements distract users from the information they really need.\n  * Prioritize the content and features to support primary goals.\n\nLearn more\n\n  * Full article: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design (Usability Heuristic #8)\n  * 3-minute video: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design\n\n## 9: Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors\n\nError messages should be expressed in plain language (no error codes),\nprecisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.\n\nThese error messages should also be presented with visual treatments that will\nhelp users notice and recognize them.\n\nExample of Usability Heuristic #9: Wrong way signs on the road remind drivers\nthat they are heading in the wrong direction and ask them to stop.\n\nTips\n\n  * Use traditional error-message visuals, like bold, red text.\n  * Tell users what went wrong in language they will understand \u2014 avoid technical jargon.\n  * Offer users a solution, like a shortcut that can solve the error immediately.\n\nLearn more\n\n  * Full article: Error-Message Guidelines\n  * 2-minute video: Helping Users Overcome Errors\n\n## 10: Help and Documentation\n\nIt\u2019s best if the system doesn\u2019t need any additional explanation. However, it\nmay be necessary to provide documentation to help users understand how to\ncomplete their tasks.\n\nHelp and documentation content should be easy to search and focused on the\nuser's task. Keep it concise, and list concrete steps that need to be carried\nout.\n\nExample of Usability Heuristic #10: Information kiosks at airports are easily\nrecognizable and solve customers\u2019 problems in context and immediately.\n\nTips\n\n  * Ensure that the help documentation is easy to search.\n  * Whenever possible, present the documentation in context right at the moment that the user requires it.\n  * List concrete steps to be carried out.\n\nLearn more\n\n  * Full article: Help and Documentation: The 10th Usability Heuristic\n  * 3-minute video: Help and Documentation\n\n## Free 10 Heuristics Poster\n\nDownload a free summary poster or 10 detailed posters of the 10 Usability\nHeuristics, designed by Kelley Gordon, Kate Moran, and Feifei Liu.\n\nDownload and print our free usability heuristic posters.

Four years later, I refined the heuristics based on a factor\nanalysis of 249 usability problems [Nielsen 1994a] to derive a set of\nheuristics with maximum explanatory power, resulting in this revised set of\nheuristics [Nielsen 1994b].\n\nIn 2020, we updated this article, adding more explanation, examples, and\nrelated links. While we slightly refined the language of the definitions, the\n10 heuristics themselves have remained relevant and unchanged since 1994. When\nsomething has remained true for 26 years, it will likely apply to future\ngenerations of user interfaces as well.\n\n### See Also\n\n#### Examples\n\n  * 10 Usability Heuristics Applied to Complex Applications \u2014 Examples of the heuristics applied to complex and domain-specific software applications.\n  * 10 Usability Heuristics Applied to Virtual Reality \u2014 See the heuristics applied to 3D virtual environments.\n  * 10 Usability Heuristics Applied to Video Games \u2014 Great examples of the 10 heuristics in highly interactive and highly visual user interfaces that have an entertainment purpose.\n  * 10 Usability Heuristics Applied to Everyday Life (Just for fun)\n\n#### Checklists & Guidelines\n\n  * Full set of 2,397 UX design guidelines (across multiple reports).\n  * Bruce \"Tog\" Tognazzini's list of basic principles for interface design.
