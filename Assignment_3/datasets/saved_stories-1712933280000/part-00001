It's hanging out the back,\nswinging the car like a pendulum. And that's key to why it's the most iconic\nsports car ever made. This fundamental imperfection is part of how it creates\nthe connection.\n\nThis is true of mechanical watches too. They're hilariously complicated pieces\nof engineering that tell time worse than a $20 Casio quartz watch. And that's\nwhy we love them. The imperfection of timekeeping, the need to manually wind\nthe things, cements the connection.\n\nThat's how computers used to feel too. The Amiga, and the Commodore 64 before\nit, were quirky bread boxes. Using chips named things like Agnus, Alice,\nDenise, Lisa, and Paula. With clicking, whirring disk drives. The flickering\nscreen when software was loading. As distinctly different from the competition\nas a Porsche flat-six is from a Ferrari V12.\n\nBut the quirky is almost all gone from modern day computers. The mac in\nparticular has been massaged to within an inch of perfection, and has thus\nbecome harder to connect with. It's a curious contradiction. We strive to make\nthings better and better, but if we succeed, we reminisce of the quirks that\nused to be.\n\nThe last MacBook I really loved was the original 11\" MacBook Air. It was full\nof compromises. A cramped screen. Chips that weren't quite fast enough. An\niconic, wedgy design. It was so good because it was also kinda bad.\n\nI thought that era was simply gone. But over the last month or so, I've\ndeveloped much of the same affection for the Framework 13. Exactly because of\nall it's compromises and it's quirky design choices.\n\nIt uses an odd 3:2 display, which is almost as tall as it is wide. In a time\nwhen most every other maker has gone 16:9 or 16:10. And it's matte, not\nglossy.\n\nThe keyboard has twice the travel of most modern laptops. Giving it almost a\nvintage feel, which, once you get used to it, is really addictive.\n\nIt has interchangeable ports?! You can configure the 4 slots with every\ncombination of USB C, USB A, ethernet ports, HDMI ports, and additional\nstorage you desire. Then swap them quickly and easily. An ingenious\nalternative to dongle life.\n\nAnd to top it off, I've chosen to run Linux on mine full time. I started out\ndual booting with Windows, but quickly realized that Linux ran faster on this\nAMD 7840U chip, and I found that Linux gave me everything I needed in more of\nthat quirky style that gives the Framework machine its appeal in the first\nplace.\n\nThose are all the good parts, but there are plenty of drawbacks too. Compared\nto a modern MacBook, the battery is inferior. I got 6 hours in mixed use\nyesterday. The screen is only barely adequate to run at retina-like 2x for\nsmooth looking fonts. Linux is far less polished than macOS. But somehow it\njust doesn't really matter.\n\nFirst of all, 6 hours is enough for regular use. If I'm doing more than that\nin a single stint without getting up, I'll be paying for it physically anyway.\nAnd the somewhat cramped resolution has made me fall in love with full-screen\napps again, like I used to do with that 11\" MacBook Air.\n\nBut this is all picking at the parts when the grand story is the sum. This\nquirky, flawed machine has created a connection I haven't had with a piece of\nphysical computer hardware in a very long time. That's notable!\n\nI know this testimony isn't likely to appeal seriously to most mac users. Just\nlike it wouldn't really have appealed to me a year or two ago. I just wasn't\nin the market for a change. And that's fine. Apple makes really, really good\ncomputers these days. Damn near perfect ones.\n\nAnd most people don't care that the 911 has the engine in the back. In fact,\nthey don't care about cars at all, really. They just want to get from A to B,\nas quickly, cheaply, and smoothly as possible. And they tell time perfectly\nfrom their smart phone display. This is the democratization of progress.\nWonderful.\n\nBut if you're the kind of person who might appreciate a slightly notchy manual\ngearbox, the click of a mechanical shutter on a camera, the ticking of the\nescapement in a watch, or, dare I say it, putting on a vinyl record, you\nshould checkout the Framework 13. The AMD version starts at just around a\nthousand bucks. So it's not like you have to switch your whole computing life\naround to give it a try.\n\nAnd, if you're a programmer, I think you should actually give Linux a try as\nwell. I've smirked about \"This Is The Year of Linux on the Desktop\" for over\ntwenty years, but now that I've been actually running it for over a month,\nI've realized it's actually here. And probably has been for quite a while. I\njust run Ubuntu 23.10, and together with ulauncher + tactile, it's a\ndelightful desktop experience (see my whole Ubuntu setup script). I even found\na replacement for my beloved iA Writer in Typora!\n\nMake no mistake, there's more fuss. More snags, more imperfections. So if you\ngo in expecting the same level of perfection you'd get from company worth\nthree trillion, you might be disappointed. But if you consider this the work\nof a worldwide open source community, it's incredible how close it is in most\nareas, ahead in a few, and not that far behind in the rest.\n\nDare to add a little imperfection into your computing setup, and you might\njust find a deeper connection to the bits and electrons running it all. And if\nyou don't, at least you got to see the sun rise in a fun location.\n\nAbout David Heinemeier Hansson\n\nMade Basecamp and HEY for the underdogs as co-owner and CTO of 37signals.\nCreated Ruby on Rails.
