Credit: NASA/Bill Ingalls\n\nCOLORADO SPRINGS \u2014 Japan will become the first nation after the United States\nto land an astronaut on the moon as part of the Artemis lunar exploration\ncampaign under an agreement between the two countries announced April 10.\n\nAt an event in Washington, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson and Japanese\nMinister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) Masahito\nMoriyama signed an agreement regarding an additional Japanese contribution to\nArtemis, a pressurized lunar rover called Lunar Cruiser.\n\nNASA will deliver the rover to the moon, which the agencies said should take\nplace ahead of the Artemis 7 mission scheduled for no earlier than 2031. NASA\nwill also provide two seats on future Artemis lunar landing missions to\nastronauts from the Japanese space agency JAXA, the first agency other than\nNASA to secure spots on landing missions.\n\n\u201cThe pressurized rover will be a powerful contribution to the overall Artemis\narchitecture as Japan and the U.S. go hand in hand with international and\nindustry partners to the lunar surface and beyond,\u201d Hiroshi Yamakawa,\npresident of JAXA, said in a statement. \u201cJAXA is ready to assist MEXT and push\nthis forward with our science and technological expertise to establish\nsustainable human presence on the moon.\u201d\n\nThe Japanese rover will support extended expeditions from Artemis landing\nsites that are beyond the range of the Lunar Terrain Vehicle that three\nAmerican companies are developing for NASA under contracts announced April 3.\nThe rover is designed to accommodate two astronauts for up to 30 days, with an\noverall lifetime of 10 years.\n\n\u201cAmerica no longer will walk on the moon alone. With this new rover, we will\nuncover groundbreaking discoveries on the lunar surface that will benefit\nhumanity and inspire the Artemis Generation,\u201d NASA Administrator Bill Nelson\nsaid in a statement.\n\nThe announcement, though, offered no details about when the Japanese\nastronauts would fly to the moon. \u201cIt depends,\u201d Nelson said at an April 10\nbriefing when asked about schedules, noting that the two countries \u201cannounced\na shared goal for a Japanese national to land on the moon on a future NASA\nmission assuming benchmarks are achieved.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo mission has been currently assigned to a Japanese astronaut,\u201d added Lara\nKearney, manager of NASA\u2019s extravehicular activity and human surface mobility\nprogram, at the briefing.\n\nThe implementing agreement said several factors will go into crew assignments,\nincluding progress on the pressurized rover, or PR: \u201cThe timing of the flight\nopportunities will be determined by NASA in line with existing flight\nmanifesting and crew assignment processes and will take into account program\nprogress and constraints, MEXT\u2019s request for the earliest possible assignment\nof the Japanese astronauts to lunar surface missions, and major PR milestones\nsuch as when the PR is first deployed on the lunar surface.\u201d\n\nThe assumption among many in the industry, though, is that at least one of the\nastronauts will fly before the rover is delivered, and possibly as soon as the\nArtemis 4 mission, the second crewed landing, in the late 2020s.\u201cWe intend to\nland an international astronaut on the surface of the moon by the end of the\ndecade,\u201d Vice President Kamala Harris said at a Dec. 20 National Space Council\nmeeting.\n\nDespite the uncertainty about when Japanese astronauts will land on the moon,\nthe agreement was welcomed by many. \u201cThis agreement represents the culmination\nof Japanese leadership, vision and resolute support that the nation has shown\nsince the very beginning of the Artemis program,\u201d Mike Gold, chief growth\nofficer of Redwire and a former NASA official, told SpaceNews. \u201cWhen the first\nJapanese astronaut steps foot on the moon, it will be a singular moment not\njust for Japan, but for the entire world.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the two landing missions, Japan has a slot on a future Artemis\nmission to the lunar Gateway as part of an earlier agreement about its\ncontributions to that lunar orbital facility. The European Space Agency has\nthree seats on Artemis missions for its contributions to the lunar Gateway,\nwith two likely to be on Artemis 4 and 5, but it has not been allocated a seat\non a landing mission yet.\n\nCanada is flying an astronaut on the Artemis 2 circumlunar mission launching\nin late 2025 and has a seat on a future Gateway mission. The United Arab\nEmirates also has a seat on a Gateway mission after completing an agreement\nwith NASA in January to develop an airlock module.\n\n### Related\n\n#### UAE to build airlock for lunar Gateway\n\nThe United Arab Emirates has agreed to develop an airlock module for the lunar\nGateway, helping complete the design of the lunar space station while\nenhancing the UAE\u2019s role in the Artemis lunar exploration effort.\n\n#### NASA selects three companies to advance Artemis lunar rover designs\n\nNASA has selected three companies to work on lunar rover concepts that would\nbe offered as a service for Artemis lunar landings and scientific activities.\n\n#### NASA delays Artemis lunar rover award by four months\n\nNASA has delayed the award of contracts to develop a lunar rover for future\nArtemis missions by four months, raising concerns in industry about the future\nof the program.\n\nTagged: Artemis, Japan, JAXA, lunar rover, NASA\n\n## Jeff Foust\n\nJeff Foust writes about space policy, commercial space, and related topics for\nSpaceNews.
