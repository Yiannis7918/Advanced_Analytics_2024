No, we won\u2019t\nexplain.\n\n## When the data was published in 2021, the company said it didn't belong to\nits customers.\n\nDan Goodin - 4/10/2024, 10:28 PM\n\nEnlarge\n\nGetty Images\n\n#### reader comments\n\n87\n\nAT&T is notifying millions of current or former customers that their account\ndata has been compromised and published last month on the dark web. Just how\nmany millions, the company isn't saying.\n\nIn a mandatory filing with the Maine Attorney General\u2019s office, the\ntelecommunications company said 51.2 million account holders were affected. On\nits corporate website, AT&T put the number at 73 million. In either event,\ncompromised data included one or more of the following: full names, email\naddresses, mailing addresses, phone numbers, Social Security numbers, dates of\nbirth, AT&T account numbers, and AT&T passcodes. Personal financial\ninformation and call history didn\u2019t appear to be included, AT&T said, and data\nappeared to be from June 2019 or earlier.\n\nThe disclosure on the AT&T site said the 73 million affected customers\ncomprised 7.6 million current customers and 65.4 million former customers. The\nnotification said AT&T has reset the account PINs of all current customers and\nis notifying current and former customers by mail. AT&T representatives\nhaven\u2019t explained why the letter filed with the Maine AG lists 51.2 million\naffected and the disclosure on its site lists 73 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a March 30 article published by TechCrunch, a security researcher\nsaid the passcodes were stored in an encrypted format that could easily be\ndecrypted. Bleeping Computer reported in 2021 that more than 70 million\nrecords containing AT&T customer data were put up for sale that year for $1\nmillion. AT&T at the time told the news site that the amassed data didn\u2019t\nbelong to its customers and that the company's systems had not been breached.\n\nLast month, after the same data reappeared online, Bleeping Computer and\nTechCrunch confirmed that the data belonged to AT&T customers, and the company\nfinally acknowledged the connection. AT&T has yet to say how the information\nwas breached or why it took more than two years from the original date of\npublication to confirm that it belonged to its customers.\n\nGiven the length of time the data has been available, the damage that\u2019s could\nresult from the most recent publication is likely to be minimal. That said,\nanyone who is or was an AT&T customer should be on the lookout for scams that\nattempt to capitalize on the leaked data. AT&T is offering one year of free\nidentity theft protection.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How Scientists Respond to Science Deniers\n\n#### reader comments\n\n87\n\nDan Goodin Dan Goodin is Senior Security Editor at Ars Technica, where he\noversees coverage of malware, computer espionage, botnets, hardware hacking,\nencryption, and passwords.
