The lean\nphysicist in baggy shorts and sandals sitting at a long table designed the\nfirst wearable computer, which he used to beat roulette in Vegas. The older\nscientist across from him, with curly white hair and the turquoise jeweled\nbolo tie, won a Nobel for discovering the quark. The attractive blond\nneuroscientist nibbling enchiladas nearby studies the modulation patterns of\npigtailed macaques. Down the hall, a gangly Brit scrawls equations in squeaky\norange magic marker on a windowpane. Even the fat tabby cat meowing for scraps\nhas scientific cred; Dr. Zen, they call him, Director of Feline Affairs. This\nis the Santa Fe Institute, a sort of Justice League of renegade geeks, where\nteams of scientists from disparate fields study the Big Questions: Why\nfinancial markets crash. How terrorist cells form. Why viruses spread. How\nlife ends. On any given day, you might pass Al Gore or David Foster Wallace at\nthe \u00e9clair tray in the kitchen. After Google\u2019s honchos spent a few days\nwandering the Institute\u2019s sunlit halls, they were so impressed by its unique\nmix of brains and natural beauty that they aspired to turn their company into\nthe \u201cSFI of Silicon Valley.\u201d\n\nBut among this rarefied gathering of leading intellects, none is more\nrespected than the spry old cowboy dipping his tortillas in beans at the lunch\ntable. Dressed in a crisp blue shirt and jeans, he sits comfortably with his\nweathered boots crossed and listens intently as a theoretical biologist who\nhas flown in from Berlin discusses something called evolutionary economics \u2014\nthe relationship between animal behavior and marketlike forces. This is\nquintessential Santa Fe stuff, examining one phenomenon (biology) in the light\nand lexicon of another (economics).\n\nThe discussion soon turns to the topic of suicide. As a slide of a West\nAfrican tribe flickers on the biologist\u2019s computer screen, the researchers dig\ninto the idea that suicide attempts can be evaluated as a kind of expression\nof market forces \u2014 a threat to remove oneself as a source of benefits to\nothers. The neuroscientist in the corner raises her hand and poses a question\nto the group: \u201cDoes anyone know another animal besides humans who commit\nsuicide?\u201d\n\n## Editor\u2019s picks\n\n### The 250 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\n\n### The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\n\n### The 50 Worst Decisions in Movie History\n\n### Every Awful Thing Trump Has Promised to Do in a Second Term\n\nBrains churn. Air conditioning whirs. For once, though, the scientists are\nstumped.\n\nThen the cowboy chimes in, as he often does, with the answer.\n\n\u201cDolphins,\u201d he says softly. \u201cDolphins do.\u201d\n\nThe only thing more unlikely than despairing dolphins is the bearer of the\nnews: Cormac McCarthy, the most celebrated recluse in American literature\nsince J.D. Salinger. Before he emerged to speak to Oprah earlier this year,\nthe 74-year-old author had granted only a handful of interviews in his four-\ndecade career. He lives so far off the beaten path, he drives a flatbed truck.\nHis self-imposed exile goes beyond the scraps of popular legend \u2014 sleeping in\ncars, bathing in lakes, too poor for toothpaste. He has never voted (\u201cpoets\nshouldn\u2019t vote\u201d), doesn\u2019t read fiction (\u201cit seems like an odd thing to do\u201d),\nand forsakes book signings, e-mail, and cellphones. For years, little was\nknown about him beyond the breadth and power of his work. His violent Western\nNo Country for Old Men has been made into one of the year\u2019s most acclaimed\nfilms, and his post-apocalyptic novel The Road won the 2007 Pulitzer Prize for\nfiction. Few living authors are as admired by their peers: When The New York\nTimes recently asked more than 100 prominent writers, critics and editors to\nidentify \u201cthe single best work of American fiction published in the last 25\nyears,\u201d one of the authors whose work was cited most was McCarthy.\n\n\u201cCormac is viewed as a recluse because he doesn\u2019t do the literature game,\u201d\nsays Doug Erwin, head of SFI\u2019s science steering committee. \u201cBut he\u2019s not\nreclusive here \u2014 he\u2019s just one of the guys.\u201d Two decades ago, McCarthy showed\nup at the Institute and essentially never left. \u201cCormac rode up on a mule one\nday,\u201d jokes a friend, \u201cand the mule died.\u201d He even moved from his home in El\nPaso, Texas, just to be nearby. Now, after dropping off his nine-year-old son\nat school in the morning, McCarthy rumbles up the winding drive to SFI, where\nhe serves as a research fellow. He checks his mail. Pours a coffee. Then he\nspends the rest of the day falling into long conversations with the scientists\nand thinkers who pass by.\n\n## Related\n\n### Love the Songwriting of Jason Isbell and Robert Earl Keen? Credit Cormac\nMcCarthy\n\n### Cormac McCarthy, Novelist Who Explored an Apocalyptic American West, Dead\nat 89\n\n### No Twitter for Old Men: No, That Cormac McCarthy Account Is Not Real\n\nFor McCarthy, the scientific life of the Institute plays a fundamental role in\nhis life as a writer, sparking his imagination with \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios while\ngrounding his fiction in a greater reality. \u201cIt helps you to think,\u201d he says\nof his interplay with SFI\u2019s intellectual \u201coutlaws,\u201d as he affectionately calls\nthem. \u201cYou have to go back to Elizabethan England or Periclean Athens to find\nthis kind of extraordinary work being done.\u201d His immersion in science has left\nhim with an admittedly pessimistic worldview; he sees human life on the planet\nas temporary, and he\u2019s sensitized to the degree at which we are accelerating\nthis fate through violence and neglect. McCarthy likes the scientists at the\nInstitute for a simple reason: The stuff they explore, like his writing, cuts\nto the bone.\n\n\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t concern life and death,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s not interesting.\u201d\n\nLong before his mule croaked here, McCarthy moved among thinkers. He speaks\nreverently of his paternal grandfather, John Francis, for whom he named his\nyoungest son. In contemporary terms, his grandfather was a startup\nentrepreneur, a handy machinist, who, like McCarthy, \u201cwas very interested in\nhow things work.\u201d He was also an early feminist who bucked the trends by\nputting all his daughters \u2014 as well as his sons \u2014 through college. One of\nMcCarthy\u2019s aunts became a biologist, another a classical-language professor.\nHis dad, Charles, was a successful lawyer who graduated at the top of his\nclass at Yale.\n\nAfter growing up in Knoxville, McCarthy followed the family tradition and\nattended college, at the University of Tennessee. \u201cI went to school because I\ndidn\u2019t want to work,\u201d he tells me with a laugh one morning over a plate of\nhuevos rancheros. We\u2019re at his favorite breakfast joint, a beautifully tiled\nrestaurant in a hotel near the square in Santa Fe. This is one of his few\nhaunts outside of the Institute, which is just a few miles up the road. \u201cIf I\nwas in school,\u201d he says, \u201cI could get a monthly check through the GI Bill.\u201d\n\nBut one subject immediately struck a nerve: science. \u201cWhen I was a kid, I was\nvery interested in the natural world,\u201d he says. \u201cTo this day, during casual\nconversations, little-known facts about the natural world will just crop up.\u201d\nOn a dime, McCarthy can slip into a 30-minute treatise on some arcane\nbiological phenomenon. \u201cVoles leave trails where they go, like markings,\u201d\nhe\u2019ll say out of the blue. \u201cThey\u2019re mostly composed of urine, but there are\nother substances as well. One absorbs ultraviolet light, which is invisible to\nus. But guess who can see it? The raptors flying overhead can see it. They\nhave ultraviolet vision! That\u2019s just very interesting. You think about these\nbirds \u2014 they\u2019re not looking for voles, they\u2019re looking for ultraviolet trails\nthrough the weeds.\u201d\n\nIn college, McCarthy studied physics and engineering \u2014 passions that remain\njust as strong today. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting to know how the world works,\u201d he says.\n\u201cPeople ask me, \u2018Why are you interested in physics?\u2019 But why would you not be?\nTo me, the most curious thing of all is incuriosity. I just don\u2019t get it.\u201d\nThere was just one problem with his course of study. \u201cI was good at it, but I\nwasn\u2019t that good,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to do anything unless I could be\nthe best at it. That\u2019s my own personal extravagant ego.\u201d\n\nBut McCarthy was really good at writing. He discovered his talent after a\ncollege professor asked him to repunctuate a collection of 18th-century essays\nfor inclusion in a textbook. McCarthy was hooked, and began to write and read\nwith vigor. While he reserves high praise for a few contemporary narratives\n(\u201cFear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a classic of our time\u201d), his list of great\nnovels stops at four: Ulysses, The Brothers Karamazov, The Sound and the Fury\nand his favorite, Moby-Dick. Like his own work, they explore themes of life\nand death with both philosophical and artful precision. McCarthy takes pains\nto distill a scene to its rawest and most powerful details \u2014 whether it\u2019s\nsomeone cleaning a wound or scalping a head \u2014 and chuck anything that gets in\nthe way, including punctuation. When he talks of writers he admires, like\nShakespeare, there\u2019s one quality he says they share in common: soul. \u201cYou\ncan\u2019t write good poetry unless you have a soul to express,\u201d he says. And he\nholds the highest regard for those who express \u201cthe soul of the culture,\u201d as\nhe puts it. \u201cThey know everyone thinks these things are important,\u201d he says,\n\u201cand that\u2019s why they\u2019re talking about them.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for McCarthy to find the important things he wanted to\nexplore. The roots of his apocalyptic themes date back to his childhood in\nTennessee. \u201cYou grow up in the South, you\u2019re going to see violence,\u201d he says.\n\u201cAnd violence is pretty ugly.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy seems almost to collect the violent stories he hears, like the tale\nof a friend who sold tie-downs used to secure mobile homes in the face of\ntornadoes. One day, a colleague of the salesman urged him to call on an\nattractive customer. \u201cSo he knocked on the mobile-home door,\u201d McCarthy says,\n\u201cand this pretty good-looking woman came to the door and said, \u2018Just come in.\u2019\nNo questions at all, just openly flirtatious. But it was such a strong come-on\nand she was so weird, he said, \u2018No, there\u2019s something wrong here, I\u2019m going to\ntake a pass on this.'\u201d\n\nThree months later, the guy picked up the newspaper and saw the woman\u2019s\npicture on the front page. \u201cThis woman and her boyfriend had been arrested,\u201d\nMcCarthy says. \u201cThey had killed her husband with an ax.\u201d\n\nAfter dropping out of college to work at an auto shop and write, McCarthy\ngained attention for the dark Appalachian soul he so deftly expressed. A\nnecrophiliac collects corpses in caves in Child of God. A brother impregnates\nhis sister in Outer Dark, only to leave the baby for dead in the woods. It was\nMcCarthy\u2019s ability to depict horrific realities with heart and exactitude that\nboth attracted and repelled.\n\nNot surprisingly, given their subject matter, his early novels didn\u2019t sell.\nOver the years, McCarthy married, had his first son, divorced, traveled, lived\nin Ibiza, married again. Through it all, he felt life provided for him when he\nmost needed it. In college, an arts foundation rewarded his first works with a\ngrant. A promotional packet of toothpaste arrived in the mail the morning he\nhad run out. One time, he had just eaten the last scraps of food in his\nfreezer when the doorbell rang. It was a courier. \u201cI thought he was there to\narrest me,\u201d McCarthy jokes. Instead, the guy handed him an envelope with a\ncheck for $20,000 \u2014 a gift from a private patron of the arts.\n\nAfter writing what he considers his most autobiographical novel, Suttree \u2014 a\ndarkly comic story that follows a down-and-out guy on a houseboat in Tennessee\nwho drifts, drinks and deals with picaresque scoundrels, like a kid who gets\narrested for fucking a watermelon in a farmer\u2019s patch \u2014 McCarthy left\nAppalachia behind and turned to what he considers the great subject of our\ntime: the American West. \u201cIt\u2019s a story that everyone in the world knows,\u201d he\nsays. \u201cYou can go to Mongolia and they know about cowboys and Indians \u2014 but no\none had taken it seriously and as a subject for literary effort.\u201d So he packed\nhis bags for Texas and hit the road.\n\nFor four years, McCarthy explored the Southwest and Mexico, studying the\nculture and history of the region. The period between the Mexican War and the\ngreat westward migration of the mid-19th century was, he says, \u201ca turning\npoint of American history.\u201d He transformed his research into Blood Meridian,\nhis apocalyptic Western of Indian scalpers. Harold Bloom, the literary critic,\nhailed the novel as one of the greatest of the 20th century.\n\nBut in writing this brutal epic of the past, McCarthy kept one foot firmly\nplanted in a doomsday future: ours. \u201cIf I wrote about violence in an\nexaggerated way, it was looking at a future that I imagined would be a lot\nmore violent,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it is. Can you remember 20 years ago having\nbeheadings on TV? I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the sixth anniversary of September 11th, and scientists from the Santa Fe\nInstitute are contemplating the end of the world. The occasion is a three-day\nconference on climate change. This evening, no one in the standing-room crowd\nof locals crammed into the auditorium recognizes McCarthy as he hunkers into\nhis seat down front. When I remark on how many people are interested in\ntonight\u2019s topic, McCarthy replies, \u201cOf course it\u2019s relevant \u2014 we\u2019re all going\nto die.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the findings are grim. For 90 minutes, Harvard geochemist Daniel\nSchrag stands at the podium and paints a Bruckheimer-esque picture of\nplanetary destruction. Nuclear winters. Mass extinction. Volcanic hell.\n\u201cImagine if a third of the Earth erupted,\u201d Schrag says, as a fiery orange\nswirl envelops a globe on the screen behind him.\n\nIt was a gathering like this that first drew McCarthy to the Institute. It\nbegan in 1981, when he was among the first in the arts and sciences to receive\na so-called genius grant from the MacArthur Foundation. Flown to Chicago for a\ndinner with the other recipients, McCarthy found himself avoiding his fellow\nwriters. \u201cThe artsy crowd was all dressed and drugged and ready to party,\u201d he\nrecalls. \u201cI just started hanging out with scientists because they were more\ninteresting.\u201d\n\nChief among them: Murray Gell-Mann, winner of the Nobel Prize for his work in\nparticle physics and then-director of the MacArthur Foundation. The unlikely\nduo became fast friends, and their meeting would radically alter the course of\nMcCarthy\u2019s life. \u201cI was interested in ecology, psychology, archaeology,\nlinguistics,\u201d Gell-Mann recalls. A group of scientists he knew at the Los\nAlamos National Laboratory, home of the Manhattan Project after World War II,\nwere also eager for a more interdisciplinary approach. Led by George Cowan,\nhead of research at Los Alamos, they created the Santa Fe Institute in 1984.\n\nWith Cowan as president and Gell-Mann as chair of the board, SFI took over an\nold convent in the heart of Santa Fe, filled it with renaissance thinkers and\nbegan forging an emerging science called complexity. It\u2019s the study of the\ncomplex systems behind our lives \u2014 from climate patterns to human societies \u2014\nand how they evolve and adapt. By uncovering these systems and the agents that\npropel them, Gell-Mann and his colleagues reasoned, we can better understand\nthe dynamics of life itself.\n\nSFI became a mecca for wayward scientists. They simulated stock markets and\nbird flocks on computers by day, and discussed the connections over blue-corn\nenchiladas late into the night. The Institute\u2019s researchers were pursuing\nartificial life and computer auctions a decade before the mainstream world\nventured online. Not everyone was a fan. \u201cPeople would say, \u2018I don\u2019t know\nabout this big mush that you\u2019re trying to create,'\u201d Gell-Mann recalls.\n\nWhile he was writing his first bestseller, All the Pretty Horses, McCarthy\nmade regular trips from El Paso to the Institute. Part of the appeal, beyond\nthe excitement of the science, is the anonymity. Since he does most of his\nwriting at home and doesn\u2019t always keep a formal office at the Institute, he\ncan easily go unnoticed. \u201cA lot of people here have no idea who I am,\u201d\nMcCarthy says. Those who do aren\u2019t sure what to make of the sight. \u201cPeople who\nknow my work walk in and they\u2019re kind of confused as to why I\u2019m there,\u201d he\nsays, \u201cbut that\u2019s OK. They soon get over that.\u201d\n\nYears after McCarthy first arrived at the Institute, his meals at SFI remain a\nhighlight of his day. \u201cYou sit down to lunch and you just don\u2019t know who\u2019s\ngoing to be there,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople drift in from all over the world \u2014 Nobel-\nwinning chemists and biologists \u2014 and they\u2019re sitting next to you at lunch.\nThey\u2019re just very generous. You ask them something, and they\u2019ll just stop what\nthey\u2019re doing and sit down and tell you all about it. And that\u2019s rather\nremarkable.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy frequently proofreads scientific papers and books by SFI\u2019s extended\nfamily. Harvard physicist Lisa Randall was surprised when she heard through a\nfriend at the Institute that McCarthy was interested in reading a draft of her\nbook Warped Passages, a heady treatise that explores the hidden dimensions of\nthe universe. \u201cI got the manuscript back in the mail, and it was marked up on\nevery page,\u201d Randall says. \u201cHe read everything. He essentially copy edited it,\ngetting rid of some of my semicolons, which he really didn\u2019t like.\u201d\n\nFor McCarthy, the scientific interplay has forced him to improve his own work.\n\u201cScience is very rigorous,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you hang out with scientists and\nsee how they think, you can\u2019t do so without developing a respect for it. And\npart of what you respect is their rigor. When you say something, it needs to\nbe right. You can\u2019t just speculate idly about things.\u201d\n\nThat sense of rigor is apparent in the increasingly taut work McCarthy has\nproduced since moving to Santa Fe, from No Country for Old Men through his\nrecent play, The Sunset Limited. \u201cWriting is rewriting,\u201d he says. \u201cSomeone\nsaid easy writing makes for hard reading.\u201d But he\u2019s still not one to map out a\nnovel before he begins. \u201cI just sit down and write whatever is interesting. If\nyou\u2019re writing mystery stories or something, you might want to have an\noutline, because it all has to have a logic and fall into place and have a\nbeginning, a middle and an end. But if you\u2019re writing a novel, the best things\njust sort of come out of the blue. It\u2019s a subconscious process. You don\u2019t\nreally know what you\u2019re doing most of the time.\u201d\n\nSo you start with a character or a scene?\n\n\u201cYou start with anything,\u201d he says. \u201cFaulkner used to say the way he started\nThe Sound and the Fury was with this single image of a girl in a tree looking\nthrough a single window at her grandmother\u2019s funeral, and the other girl\nlooking at her muddy drawers from where they\u2019d been playing. It was just that\nimage, which was probably just some image from his childhood. You think about\nthat image,\u201d he laughs. \u201cDoes The Sound and the Fury inevitably spring from\nthat image? Well I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nOne day a few years ago, after checking his mail and pouring his coffee,\nMcCarthy gingerly made his way down the hall at the Institute. He passed the\nequation-scrawled windowpane, down the steps where Dr. Zen was curled in the\ncorner, past the long, red sofa where a grad student lay sprawled, and into\nthe corner office of his friend Doug Erwin. Then he started asking about the\napocalypse. In particular, he wanted to know about extinction \u2014 the\nCretaceous-Tertiary meteorite that wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years\nago.\n\nErwin is the guy to ask. A Smithsonian paleobiologist with a boyish fop of\nbrown hair, Erwin is an expert on the subject: He wrote a book titled\nExtinction. He and McCarthy share a wry and fatalistic view of our time here\non Earth. \u201cThe planet is going to do just fine without us,\u201d Erwin says. \u201cWe\u2019re\nan encephalized ape that won\u2019t last long.\u201d\n\nErwin told McCarthy about the likely aftermath of the deadly meteorite: the\nmagnitude of the desolation, the collapse of ecosystems, the fallout of debris\nand gases. Then, one day last year, Erwin sat down to read a galley of The\nRoad, which depicts the harrowing, post-apocalyptic journey of a father and\nson. Erwin smiled \u2014 so this is what McCarthy was up to, he figured.\n\nHe let his friend off the hook for the novel\u2019s intentional inaccuracies.\n\u201cInstead of having gray skies that look like Beijing, it would actually be\nblue skies like this,\u201d Erwin tells me one afternoon, as he motions outside his\nwindow to the hills rolling down toward Santa Fe. \u201cThere would also be a lot\nmore ferns. But because of what he was trying to achieve, he had to take some\nartistic license. That book was about his son.\u201d\n\nNine years ago, after marrying for the third time, McCarthy became a father\nagain. Soon after, in 2001, he was visiting Tennessee when the attacks of 9/11\nunfolded. Being a septuagenarian dad in the modern age is sobering. \u201cWhen\nyou\u2019re young and single, you hang out in bars and don\u2019t think about what\u2019s\ngoing to happen,\u201d McCarthy says. \u201cBut in the next 50 years when you have kids,\nyou start thinking of their life and the world they have to live in. And\nthat\u2019s a sobering thought these days. I\u2019m not one of those conspiracy guys,\nbut the world is in a very unstable situation. If you were to take thoughtful\npeople on, say, January 1st, 1900, and tell them what the 20th century was\ngoing to look like, they\u2019d say, \u2018Are you shitting me?'\u201d\n\nMcCarthy began to wonder about the future facing his boy. \u201cI think about John\nall the time and what the world\u2019s going to be like,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s going to\nbe a very troubled place.\u201d One night, during a trip to Texas with John,\nMcCarthy imagined such a place. While his son slept, McCarthy gazed out the\nwindow of his room and pictured flames on the hill. He later decided to write\na novel about it; The Road is dedicated to his son. While McCarthy suggests\nthat the ash-covered world in the novel is the result of a meteor hit, his\nmoney is on humans destroying each other before an environmental catastrophe\nsets in. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do ourselves in first,\u201d he says.\n\nIn part, he blames an increasingly violent society. \u201cIf kids are unstable,\nthey may very well be cranked up by the violence they see, and might do things\nthat they wouldn\u2019t have done or would have taken them longer to get around\nto,\u201d McCarthy says. \u201cBut the real culprit is violence against children. A lot\nof children don\u2019t grow up well. They\u2019re being starved and sexually molested.\nWe know how to make serial killers. You just take a Type A kid who\u2019s fairly\nbright and just beat the crap out of him day after day. That\u2019s how it\u2019s done.\u201d\n\nWhile The Road paints a picture of life after the end, his previous novel, No\nCountry for Old Men, suggests how the final days begin. In a particularly\nmemorable scene, a graying sheriff in the book declares, \u201cIt starts when you\nbegin to overlook bad manners. Any time you quit hearin Sir and Mam the end is\npretty much in sight.\u201d Like the characters in his novels, whether it\u2019s the\nyoung cowboys of the Border Trilogy or the charming rogues of Suttree,\nMcCarthy tries to live by a code of civility. He shows up when he says he\u2019ll\nshow up. He inquires about sick parents. After a meal at SFI, he\u2019s the first\nto clear a visitor\u2019s plate. When a friend refused to see a doctor, McCarthy\nswore to call every day and bug him until he got the care he needed. After 10\ndays of calls, the friend gave in.\n\nAt the same time, however, McCarthy seems resigned to the fact that bad\nmanners and violence are here to stay. \u201cThere are a lot of people out there \u2014\na lot who grew up in the Sixties and are still flower children \u2014 who imagine\nyou can just get people to stop being violent,\u201d he says. \u201cThey pretend that\nthe world they live in is that world, but it\u2019s not. The world\u2019s not like the\nworld they want to live in, and probably never will be.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s September 13th, the last day of the Santa Fe Institute\u2019s climate-change\nconference, and McCarthy takes a seat near the front. It has been a dark week:\n9/11 memorials. Deadly earthquakes in Indonesia. A gang of West Virginians\ncaught after raping and beating a young black woman all week in a trailer.\nPresident Bush on TV, talking about an extended stay in Iraq. It\u2019s times like\nthese when McCarthy imagines packing up and hitting the road for good. \u201cIf the\nfamily situation was different, I could see taking John and going to New\nZealand,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a civilized place and far from the evil shit going\ndown.\u201d\n\nTaking the stage, SFI president Geoffrey West suggests that there are two\nroads of thought we can choose to follow. The first is that we can believe our\npower to heal the Earth before it\u2019s too late. He tells the audience that\nAmerica needs to create a sort of reverse Manhattan Project \u2014 call it the\nSanta Fe Project \u2014 that would bring together a consortium of top minds to\nengineer solutions to the escalating crises of sustainability and survival.\n\nThen again, he adds, there is another path. We can choose to believe that\n\u201cwe\u2019re a blip on the landscape, and that the vision of another SFI fellow,\nCormac McCarthy, is where we\u2019re headed.\u201d\n\nAt the mention of McCarthy\u2019s name, there\u2019s a rumbling in the crowd as retirees\ncrane over to find Oprah\u2019s book-club man. Making his way back to his seat,\nWest whispers sheepishly to McCarthy, \u201cYou\u2019re never going to forgive me, are\nyou?\u201d McCarthy good-naturedly pats West on the shoulder and assures him that\nit\u2019s all right.\n\nIn fact, as McCarthy told me earlier in the day, he has been thinking about\nhis own finale, too. \u201cEventually you start to he realize that you aren\u2019t going\nto be around for very long,\u201d he says. For the past few years, his sense of\nmortality has inspired him to work on as many as five novels at a time. No\nCountry for Old Men just happened to be the one he finished first. Switching\nback and forth between narratives, he says, isn\u2019t a problem. All he has to do\nis work a bit on one book, take a walk, and then switch gears into something\nelse. He\u2019s also entertaining what he may do should he run out of steam.\n\n## Trending\n\n### Drake\u2019s Response Track to Kendrick Lamar Appears to Have Leaked\n\n### O.J.

But all this talk about the end of the world has made him appreciate\nmore than ever what he has. \u201cThere is for a man two things in life that are\nvery important, head and shoulders above everything else,\u201d he says. \u201cFind work\nyou like, and find someone to live with you like. Very few people get both.\u201d\n\nOn this evening, as the Institute\u2019s lecture ends and the lights come up on the\ncrowd, McCarthy says goodbye to his friends and heads out into the darkness.\nIt\u2019s getting late. Tomorrow\u2019s a weekday. He wants to wake up early and drive\nhis boy to school.\n\n#### Get the Rolling Stone Daily Newsletter\n\nGet the latest in music, politics, TV & movies, (sub)culture and more.\n\nYou're signed up for the Rolling Stone Daily Newsletter\n\n#### Get all of Rolling Stone.\n\n25% off digital access, print delivery, or both!\n\nSubscribe Now\n\nCancel Anytime\n\n### More News\n\n  * ### O.J.
