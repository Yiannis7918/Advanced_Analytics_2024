Its staff\nrevolted.\n\n## In a resignation letter, an adviser called carbon credits \"scientifically,\nsocially, and from a climate perspective a hoax.\"\n\nTomohiro Ohsumi / Getty Images\n\nJoseph Winters Staff Writer\n\nPublished\n\n    Apr 12, 2024\n\nTopic\n\n    Climate + Accountability\n\nShare/Republish\n\n    \n\nCopy Link Republish\n\nCopy Link Email SMS Twitter Facebook\n\nRepublish Reddit LinkedIn\n\nThe world\u2019s most prominent verification program for corporate climate pledges\nis reportedly in turmoil following its board of trustees\u2019 unilateral decision\nthis week to allow carbon offsets to count toward companies\u2019 supply chain\nemissions reduction targets.\n\nIn a letter to the board seen by Grist, dozens of staffers and program\nmanagers at the Science-Based Targets initiative, or SBTi, said the decision\nhad caused \u201cgrave reputational damage\u201d and implied that it risked turning\ntheir organization into a \u201cgreenwashing platform.\u201d\n\nThe letter called for the resignation of SBTi CEO Luiz Amaral and board\nmembers who supported the change, as well as the withdrawal of the new policy.\n\n\u201cThe actions of the CEO and the board have resulted in significant harm to our\norganization\u2019s reputation and viability,\u201d the letter said.\n\nGrist thanks its sponsors.

Here's How\n\nThe SBTi is a nonprofit that sets standards for corporate emissions reduction\ntargets. It evaluates hundreds of companies\u2019 targets each year and certifies\nthose it deems legitimate. Companies, in turn, advertise the SBTi\u2019s\ncertification as evidence that their pledges are meaningful.\n\nAmong the staffers\u2019 main concerns is that access to carbon credits will\nincentivize companies to offset, rather than reduce, greenhouse gas emissions\nfrom the transportation and production of materials they buy and products they\nsell to consumers. Scientists say companies should do everything they can to\nlimit these emissions, known as \u201cscope 3\u201d emissions, before trying to cancel\nthem out with credits.\n\nCarbon credits are supposed to represent some amount of carbon emissions that\nare avoided or removed from the atmosphere \u2014 through projects like planting\ntrees or installing wind turbines \u2014 but experts say it\u2019s questionable whether\nthey actually work. More than 90 percent of the rainforest-based credits\noffered by one popular organization were shown last year to be \u201cworthless,\u201d\nlargely because they promised to protect forests that were never under threat.\n(The issuer of those credits disputed the findings.)\n\nThe SBTi staffers also said the board moved \u201cprematurely,\u201d without notifying\nor adequately consulting with its technical advisers.\n\nGrist thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling\nyour ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\n\u201cThe Technical Council was neither informed, consulted, nor given approval for\nsuch a significant decision,\u201d they wrote, calling this a \u201cclear and apparent\nbreach\u201d of the SBTi\u2019s governance structures. At least one of the SBTi\u2019s\ntechnical advisory group members \u2014 Stephan Singer, a senior adviser at the\nnonprofit Climate Action Network \u2014 said he resigned from the SBTi over the\nissue. In his resignation letter, obtained by the Financial Times, he called\ncarbon credits \u201cscientifically, socially, and from a climate perspective a\nhoax.\u201d\n\nDoreen Stabinsky, another SBTi adviser and a professor of global environmental\npolitics at the College of the Atlantic in Maine, told Grist the move was a\n\u201ccorporate takeover of SBTi that will undermine any \u2018science-based\u2019\ncredibility they had.\u201d\n\nMore than 90 percent of the rainforest-based credits offered by one popular\norganization were shown last year to be \u201cworthless,\u201d largely because they\npromised to protect forests that were never under threat. Michael Dantas / AFP\nvia Getty Images\n\nThe trustees\u2019 abrupt decision may have been influenced by external pressure to\nboost business prospects for the voluntary carbon market. Over the past few\nyears, investigations and public scrutiny of \u201cfraudulent\u201d offsets have made\nprospective buyers wary of carbon credits; perhaps fearing backlash, companies\nbought 17 percent fewer carbon credits in 2022 than they did the previous\nyear.\n\nIf the SBTi softened its position on these credits, it could drive up demand\nfor them. Carbon credit programs would benefit from a bigger pool of\ninterested buyers, and companies would be able to meet their emissions\nreduction targets more easily. Indeed, dozens of companies told the SBTi in a\nsurvey published last month that meeting their scope 3 targets is \u201ctoo much of\na challenge,\u201d and the overwhelming majority of positive reactions to the\nboard\u2019s about-face on carbon credits have come from carbon market funders and\nparticipants like the American Forest Foundation, Climate Impact Partners, and\nIndigo Ag.\n\nMar\u00eda Mendiluce, CEO of the We Mean Business Coalition \u2014 which advocates for\ncorporate climate action and is one of the SBTi\u2019s five partner organizations \u2014\nsaid in a statement that the move would allow companies to \u201cbring more\ninnovation and investment into cutting emissions from their value chains,\nwhile also bringing in much needed funding for climate projects in the Global\nSouth.\u201d\n\nOrganizations that set standards for the voluntary carbon market in order to\nhelp it grow, including the International Emissions Trading Association, the\nIntegrity Council for Voluntary Carbon Markets, and the Voluntary Carbon\nMarkets Integrity Initiative, also supported the new policy. The last of these\nrecently adopted a similar position on carbon credits used to offset supply\nchain emissions that raised similar concerns among experts.\n\n\u201cThe faulty business model of offset credits is in danger, and this wild move\nis an attempt to keep the business model alive,\u201d Sybrig Smit, a policy analyst\nfor the nonprofit NewClimate Institute, told Grist. \u201cIt\u2019s not an attempt to\nsave the climate.\u201d\n\nSome carbon credit proponents may have lobbied the SBTi board directly for a\nchange in policy. Earlier this week, the Financial Times reported that the\nBezos Earth Fund, a $10 billion philanthropic organization created by Amazon\nfounder Jeff Bezos and a \u201ccore funder\u201d of the SBTi, arranged a two-day meeting\nin March with SBTi board members, at which representatives of the fund urged\nthe SBTi to allow companies to use offsets.\n\nRead Next\n\nCorporate climate plans are improving, but still \u2018critically insufficient\u2019\n\nJoseph Winters\n\nThe Bezos Earth Fund is a founding sponsor, along with the Rockefeller\nFoundation and the U.S. State Department, of a large-scale carbon credit\nsystem that was first unveiled at the U.N.\u2019s annual climate summit in 2022. At\nthe time, an independent analysis suggested that the system would need to\nattract significant business participation in order to have more than marginal\nimpact on greenhouse gas emissions and climate finance.\n\nThe initiative \u201cbasically aims to develop a system that will look to sell a\nlot of credits, and they need to find buyers,\u201d said Gilles Dufrasne, lead on\nglobal carbon markets for the European nonprofit Carbon Market Watch.\n\nThe Bezos fund and its partners relaunched their carbon credit system at last\nyear\u2019s U.N. summit and said they would finalize a framework for the system by\nEarth Day 2024, less than two weeks after the SBTi board\u2019s announcement.\nDufrasne called the timing \u201ccurious.\u201d\n\nThe Bezos Earth Fund did not respond to Grist\u2019s request for comment, but the\nphilanthropy told the Financial Times it was uninvolved in the SBTi\u2019s new\npolicy on offsets. A spokesperson said the fund is committed to \u201censuring that\nany use of high integrity market mechanisms is subject to stringent\nguardrails, limits, and rules so that any use of high integrity carbon credits\nenhances rather than undermines the integrity of corporate climate targets.\u201d\n\nNeither the U.S. Department of State nor the SBTi board of trustees responded\nto Grist\u2019s requests for comment. Amaral, the SBTi\u2019s CEO, didn\u2019t respond to a\nmessage on LinkedIn.\n\nAcross academia and the advocacy world, critics have not held back in\nrepudiating the SBTi board\u2019s decision. Teresa Anderson, global lead on climate\njustice for the nonprofit ActionAid International, said on X that the move\n\u201crenders the standard for climate action meaningless.\u201d Alison Taylor, a\nclinical professor at the New York University Stern School of Business, posted\nthat the move was \u201cgood news for voluntary carbon markets, bad news for the\noverwhelming prevalence of BS in this area.\u201d\n\nOther organizations, including Carbon Market Watch, run their own efforts to\nevaluate private sector decarbonization plans, but none of them do it at the\nsame scale as the SBTi. In 2022, the organization approved more than 1,000\ncompanies\u2019 climate pledges. It removed hundreds of them from a validation\nprocess last month over their failure to submit sufficiently ambitious\nemissions reduction targets.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just sad,\u201d said Peter Riggs, director of the environmental nonprofit\nPivot Point, describing the niche position the SBTi has held as a widely\nrespected arbiter of corporate climate plans, trusted by both business leaders\nand climate advocacy groups. \u201cWe were hoping SBTi was going to be the exemplar\nof integrity at a time when other initiatives were still messing around with\noffsets. And now they\u2019re indistinguishable.\u201d\n\nA message from\n\n#### All donations DOUBLED!\n\nGrist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable\nsolutions to climate change.
