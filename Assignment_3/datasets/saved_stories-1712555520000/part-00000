On climb out the crew advised ATC that some\nengine panels had come off during departure and returned to Denver for a safe\nlanding on runway 34L about 30 minutes after departure.The FAA reported:\n\"Southwest Airlines Flight 3695 returned safely to Denver International\nairport around 8:15 a.m. local time on Sunday, April 7, after the crew\nreported the engine cowling fell off during takeoff and struck the wing flap.\nThe Boeing 737-800 was towed to the gate. The aircraft was headed to William\nP. Hobby Airport in Houston. The FAA will investigate.\"A replacement Boeing\n737-800 registration N8523W reached Houston with a delay of about 3 hours.The\noccurrence aircraft is still on the ground in Denver about 5:15 hours after\nlanding\nback.https://flightaware.com/live/flight/SWA3695/history/20240407/1350Z/KDEN/KHOUPassenger\nVideo of departure:| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1-WszopfyI  \n---  \n  \nReader Comments: (the comments posted below do not reflect the view of The\nAviation Herald but represent the view of the various posters)\n\n737 indications in the flight deck By (anonymous) on Monday, Apr 8th 2024\n00:10Z\n\nThe 737 doesn't have any indicator that would say that the cowlings are\nunlocked, nor is there one that says that they've been ripped off. The only\nindication from the aircraft that something is wrong would be if the engines\ngot damaged during the detachment, thus the engine parameters showing abnormal\nreadings. Otherwise, the cabin crew down the back would be the ones to tell\nthe pilots. Pretty sure every other airliner is the same too, unless there's\nbeen a change somewhere that I'm not aware of?\n\n@Billy By Thunderstruck on Sunday, Apr 7th 2024 22:46Z\n\nYou\u2019d think an open latch would\u2019ve been visible during pre flight walk around\nby flight crew ...\n\nSeems like incompetence lead to incontinence.\n\nSeriously, airlines flying Boeing should prob provide Depends Adult diapers\ninstead of card bags in each seat back !\n\n\u0304\\\\_(\u00c4)_/ \u0304\n\nInspection panel warning lamp By Billy on Sunday, Apr 7th 2024 22:39Z\n\nAre their no warning lamps in the cockpit to show open hatches/doors nowadays.\nIt seems quite a simple fix.\n\n@kostas By Thunderstruck on Sunday, Apr 7th 2024 22:37Z\n\nWha wha ...\n\nYou must be of limited mental capacity to believe somehow the flight crew\ncould be informed in the limited time available ...\n\n@piet snot By (anonymous) on Sunday, Apr 7th 2024 22:25Z\n\nThe video title is describing the departure of the parts I think that is what\nit means\n\nSevere windstorm yesterday 1/6 By HawkeyeX on Sunday, Apr 7th 2024 22:21Z\n\nI wonder if the severe windstorm Denver had yesterday played a role in this?\n\nWe had 100+ MPH winds all day yesterday.\n\ncabin call to abort takeoff By Werner Huss on Sunday, Apr 7th 2024 21:35Z\n\n@Kostas Do you really think the flight crew will answer a cabin call during\ntakeoff between 80kts and v1? I wouldn\u2019t have answered even after liftoff\nuntil above 500 ft agl at the earliest. Werner Huss, Cpt A330/340 rtd\n\n@kostas By wedge on Sunday, Apr 7th 2024 21:11Z\n\nThat's just not possible, many reasons for that, first of all things takeoff\nroll take about I'd say 40s or something like that. Most likely it did not\nhappen right away.\n\nThen even if it was happening, crew members as well as passengers are in their\nseats, and no one will be able to advise the crew at that point, unless\nchaning the message from passenger ot passenger which would take a lot of\ntime.\n\nCockpit is also supposed to be sterile, I'm pretty sure as per SOP that there\nwould be no communication between the cabin and the cockpit in this critical\nphase of flight.\n\nAnd finally seeing how they cameback with the engine operating they probably\ndid not had any indiciation at that time in the cockpit, and probably did not\nheard anything the cockpit being far ahead from the engines.\n\npassenger video By (anonymous) on Sunday, Apr 7th 2024 21:08Z\n\nPassenger video taken on landing not departure. One can really see the speed\nbrakes deploying on touchdown at the beginning of the video.\n\nthe ramp A&Ps at DEN By Mister Moochy on Sunday, Apr 7th 2024 20:45Z\n\nApparently there are a few MAGAt supporters working as A&Ps on the DEN ramp.\nsmh\n\nSomeone is getting fired By joe momma on Sunday, Apr 7th 2024 20:30Z\n\nSomeone is getting fired..\n\n@kostas By Frequentflyer on Sunday, Apr 7th 2024 20:17Z\n\nEven if it was happening before V1, the time on the runway for someone to see\nthat, calla flight attendant and tell them what is happening, then the flight\nattendant to contact the cockpit is what, maybe 30-45 seconds?\n\nYou can't even make the statement that fast to explain what is happening.\n\nBy (anonymous) on Sunday, Apr 7th 2024 20:08Z\n\nLoss of the cowls can compromise engine fire extinguishing capability.\n\nVideo of landing, not t/o By another Simon on Sunday, Apr 7th 2024 19:59Z\n\nThat video shows the landing, not the t/o. Damage to leading edge flaps\nclearly visible after parts of the cowling tear loose. Luckily, at these low\nspeeds the stabilizer probably wasn't damaged by flying away pieces.\n\nI guess engine was serviced prior and somebody forgot to properly secure the\ncowling.\n\nAbort takeoff By Kostas on Sunday, Apr 7th 2024 19:46Z\n\nIt seems that the panels began detaching well before V1, I wonder why didn't\nthey abort the takeoff? Perhaps the information were slow to reach the\ncockpit? Are there SOP in place for situations like this?\n\nTitle of video By Piet snot on Sunday, Apr 7th 2024 19:42Z\n\nThe title above the video says \u201e Passenger Video of departure\u201c. Im pretty\nshure it shows the landing instead\n\nThe Aviation Herald Apps Android and iOSSupport The Aviation\nHeraldEuroUS$Interview:The human factor named \"Simon Hradecky\" and the team of\nman and machine  \n  \nGet the news right onto your desktop when they happen  \n---  \n  \n\u00a9 2008-2024 by The Aviation Herald, all rights reserved, reprint and\nrepublishing prohibited.
