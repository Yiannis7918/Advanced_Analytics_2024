The week ahead: The March Jobs Report - Don't trust the 'experts'\n  2. Our favorite new markets: SpaceX launches, RT scores, crypto crashes\n  3. New Features: SIG market makers = more liquidity\n\n### The week ahead...\n\nMarch jobs numbers - Don't trust the 'experts'\n\nThe March Jobs Report will be released this Friday, March 5th, at 8:30 am ET.\nAnd according to the \u201cexperts,\u201d we can expect between 150,000 to 200,000 jobs\nadded.\n\n  * Citi: 100,000 - 150,000\n  * Bloomberg: 200,000\n  * WSJ: 200,000\n  * BofA: (Michael Gapen) 200,000\n\nBut based on previous months, these estimates are probably as accurate as your\ngrandma's Facebook posts.\n\nSo far in 2024, most analysts have really missed the mark, and job growth has\nconsistently beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations.\n\nThat's why you\u2019re much better off checking Kalshi\u2019s 'Jobs numbers' market than\nlistening to the pundits.\n\nWhile Kalshi\u2019s market forecasts have also come in low, they've consistently\nbeen much closer than most (if not all) the experts.\n\nFor example, take a look at February:\n\n  * Wall Street Consensus: 198,000\n  * Kalshi Market Forecast: 223,000\n  * Actual Report: 275,000 jobs added\n\nSo, what does Kalshi think is in store for the March Jobs Report?\n\nAs of now, the forecast calls for 214,000 jobs added, which is significantly\nhigher than most analysts.\n\nBut unlike analysts' forecasts and \u2018consensus\u2019 surveys, Kalshi\u2019s markets\ngenerate a distribution of all possible outcomes based on the trading.\n\nSo aside from our forecast of 214,000, we can also look at variance and error\nmargin, which provides a more accurate and more nuanced view.\n\nAs you can see, our consensus forecast might be 214,000, but our traders are\npricing in a 35% chance that 250,000 jobs will be added.\n\nThey\u2019re also saying there\u2019s nearly a 20% chance of job growth above 300,000!\n\nThat might sound outlandish based on the other forecasts. But just two months\nago, when January's report absolutely demolished expert expectations with\n353,000 jobs added, some Kalshi traders made bank.\n\nIn fact, one brilliant trader absolutely nailed it, and turned about $500 into\nover $9,000! How's that for ROI?\n\n### Our favorite markets...\n\nSpaceX launches this year?\n\nSpaceX Rocket Launch\n\nElon Musk is having a rough year, at least when it comes to Tesla and Twitter.\nBut the world\u2019s second richest man has at least one thing going for him\n(beyond his unimaginable wealth and fame): rocket ships!\n\nSpaceX rocket launches are still going strong, and the company is well on its\nway to surpassing last year\u2019s total of 98 successful launches. Where will\n2024\u2019s total end up? Check out our market, and make your own prediction.\n\n\u2018The First Omen\u2019 Rotten Tomatoes market For the second week in a row, our\nRotten Tomatoes markets were a big hit, and our \u2018Godzilla X Kong\u2019 market did\nover $100,000 in volume. Will this week\u2019s market for \u2018The First Omen\u2019 prove to\nbe as popular? Click here to find out.\n\nCrypto crash? Earlier this week, the price of Bitcoin dropped over $5,000 in\n24 hours. But just because BTC is falling doesn\u2019t mean your net worth has to\nfall with it. You can use our yearly, monthly and daily Bitcoin price markets\nto hedge against drops. Or, if you think it\u2019s only a temporary setback, you\ncan use them as a chance to buy the dip.\n\n### Liquidity is (finally) here...\n\nThe goal of a prediction market like Kalshi is to allow you to take your view\nof the world and turn it directly and precisely into a trade... at least in\ntheory.\n\nIn practice, a lack of liquidity often bursts this bubble, resulting in low\nvolume markets with prices that aren\u2019t worth the risk or hassle.\n\nAfter all, offering markets that cover a wide range of exciting, relevant\ntopics is great. But if you're unable to enter or exit a trade, what's the\npoint?\n\nHowever, now that Susquehanna International Group (SIG) has onboarded as a\nmarket maker, low liquidity is about to become a thing of the past.\n\nSIG is one of the largest and most respected market makers on the planet, and\nthey\u2019ve set up a dedicated trading division just for prediction markets on\nKalshi.\n\nTheir team will be providing close to 30x the liquidity that was previously\navailable in select markets, so you can enter and exit large positions freely,\nwithout much price slippage, at any point of the day (from 9am to 5pm ET).\n\nAs a result, in some of Kalshi\u2019s major markets, you can now make trades for\nsix-to seven figures without issue. And they will be expanding over time to\ncover more and more markets.\n\nIn the past, the two biggest obstacles for prediction markets have been legal\nregulations and liquidity fears. But Kalshi has managed to solve both of those\nproblems, which means the future looks bright.\n\nLearn more here.\n\nDisclosure\n\nKalshi\u2019s upcoming new markets and features are not guaranteed to be live.\nThese previews are meant to provide traders and interested observers with a\nsneak peek into what Kalshi is building, but they are not a promise that they\nwill eventually be live.\n\nRead next\n\nLiquid Prediction Markets are (finally) here...\n\nKalshi Kit: Beyonc\u00e9 goes country... and Starship goes to Mars?\n\nThe Kalshi Kit: Crypto comes to Kalshi\n\nTrade Directly On\n\n# Web, iOS, Android & API\n\nDisclaimer: It is important to understand that every individual's financial\nsituation is unique, and there are many factors that should be taken into\nconsideration before making any financial decisions.
