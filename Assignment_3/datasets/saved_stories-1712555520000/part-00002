There exists millions of uni codes containing foreign\nlanguages, emojis, etc. This standard won't be reverted. It is up to websites\nor the browser to ban characters. Some characters can have effects like making\nyou write right to left, or act as the spacing between letters. From my\nresearch going through unicode charts I found 9 code points that are empty in\nlength. It wouldn't be right to call them spaces because they don't even take\nup space.\n\nNow in the same way 2+2 = 4, we could say codepoint1+codepoint2 = A\n\nZWUS-6, the 6 standing for base6 or senary, converts the code point to base6,\nthen encodes the numbers with the zero width character assigned to 0-6\n\nThis extension defines a standard to represent all unicode so they can be\nencoded into zero width.\n\n    \n    \n    /** Zero Width Unicode Standard */ const ZWUS = { alphabet: {unifier: \"\\u{200C}\", 0:\"\\u{200D}\", 1: \"\\u{200F}\", 2: \"\\u{00AD}\", 3: \"\\u{2060}\", 4: \"\\u{200B}\", 5: \"\\u{200E}\", 6:\"\\u{180E}\", 7:\"\\u{FEFF}\"}, encodeString: (text, base = 6) => Array.from(text, u => u.codePointAt(0).toString(base).split('').map(x => ZWUS.alphabet[x]).join('')).join(ZWUS.alphabet.unifier)}\n\nI've personally tested them in places like Discord, Steam chat, Reddit,\nGithub, local text files, etc. For extra security you can encrypt the text as\nwell however this will increase its storage size. I highly doubt forensics\nteams have protocol in place to scan for hidden zero width. You can hide\nprivate information in a place no one can see or use it to communicate.\n\nIn update 2.0 the signature feature was removed so all encoded text only\nincludes relevant data. Furthermore this extension requires no browser\npermissions and collects zero data.\n\nalso available on npmjs\n\n## About\n\nGiving you the ability to generate invisible text that you can then use to\ncommunicate with or use for Canary traps.
