The project\nnot only preserves their highly biodiverse rainforest, but it funnels life-\nchanging income to Indigenous landowners.\n\nBy Jo Chandler \u2022 April 15, 2024\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Email\n\nWhen head ranger Ikavy Pitatamae walks into the rainforest on Choiseul Island,\nthe westernmost of the nearly 1,000 islands that make up the South Pacific\narchipelago of Solomon Islands, he surveys it with the heart of a tribal\nlandowner and the eye of a forester.\n\nLeading the way up a track into the bush, he wades into a glassy stream,\nstirring small, brown fish into a spin. Surveys have identified some 50\nfreshwater species in these waters, a haven of biodiversity in a nation\nravaged by high rates of logging. At the sound of a thumping whoosh overhead,\nPitatamae points up just as two Papuan hornbills flash across a gap in the\ncanopy. \u201cThey always fly in pairs,\u201d observes Wilko Bosma, a lanky Dutchman\ntrailing behind the ranger. \u201cThey\u2019re committed for life.\u201d\n\nBosma made his own commitment to this forest after landing here 25 years ago\nas an idealistic forestry graduate, working alongside Indigenous tribal\nlandowners on small, sustainable timber projects. That\u2019s how, in 2004, he came\nto establish with tribal partners a local conservation NGO \u2014 the Natural\nResources Development Foundation (NRDF) \u2014 and got to know Linford Pitatamae,\nthe older brother of ranger Ikavy and a leader of their tribe, the Sirebe.\n\nLinford Pitatamae, a leader of the Sirebe tribe. Jo Chandler\n\nTogether with a handful of neighboring tribes, the Sirebe resisted offers of\nquick money from the Malaysian companies whose ships lurk off the coast, piled\nwith logs for export to China, and began laying plans to profit from allowing\ntheir trees to stand. Aerial maps reveal their remarkable success: the only\nexpanse of green on the island that is not scarred by logging roads.\n\n### NEVER MISS AN ARTICLE\n\nSubscribe to the E360 Newsletter for weekly updates delivered to your inbox.\nSign Up.\n\n\u201cIf we misuse or destroy this land, we will not have any other,\u201d explains\nLinford Pitatamae. \u201cSo we have been committed to protect our lands, our\nforests, our rivers and streams, and all the resources for quite a long time.\u201d\n\nFinally, the Sirebe\u2019s long game is paying dividends. In 2019, the tribe\u2019s\nthree-square-mile forest became the first legally protected area in the\nnation, a \u201cbeacon of conservation and natural resource management,\u201d according\nto Culwick Togamana, Solomon Islands\u2019 environment minister. In February 2022,\nthe Sirebe became the nation\u2019s first landowners to receive payment from\ninternational investors for keeping their forests intact. With neighboring\ntribes also securing protected areas and selling \u201chigh integrity\u201d carbon\ncredits to buyers looking to offset their greenhouse emissions or burnish\ntheir green credentials, the Babatana Rainforest Conservation Project \u2014 named\nfor the tribes\u2019 shared language group \u2014 now covers 26 square miles of\nprotected tropical rainforest.\n\nA sign marks the boundary of protected Sirebe land. Douglas Junior Pikacha /\nNakau\n\nIkavy Pitatamae opens his phone to record his sighting of the hornbills in a\nbiodiversity app, then uploads a photograph of a fallen tree into another app\nused for tracking changes in forest conditions. The calculations underwriting\nthe value of this project on the international carbon market began with\npainstaking surveys the rangers conducted over six months, prior to its\nverification in 2021. They measured everything growing and living within a\nlist of survey sites 80 feet in diameter. Rangers repeat the surveys every 10\nyears and annually conduct transect surveys that record every change and every\nanimal spotted. Rangers routinely patrol boundaries, checking for incursions.\nReports are verified by independent auditors and against satellite imagery.\n\nPushing through the dense tangle of vines and shrubs to the base of a giant\nbrown terminalia tree, Ikavy Pitatamae demonstrates how baseline data are\ncollected. He passes a measuring tape around the tree\u2019s girth, then aims a\nlaser beam up to where the trunk \u2014 likely 200 years in the making \u2014 branches\nout. Loggers would covet this specimen. Pitatamae\u2019s data points verify that\nthis forest contains harvestable and marketable timber that would likely be\nfelled were it not protected \u2014 thus demonstrating a core carbon market\nrequirement that the trees would not otherwise exist without this project. The\ndata are also necessary for tallying the forest\u2019s carbon store, or inventory.\nThe magnificent canopy, the forest\u2019s messy middle story of young trees and\nsaplings, and the biomass of its understory would all be just collateral\ndamage to loggers coming for this tree\u2019s trunk. But left standing, they are\npart of the complex calculus paying the rangers\u2019 wages and supporting others\nin the tribal communities and villages.\n\nRanger Elijah Qalolilio Junior uses a smartphone map app as he monitors the\nforest. Douglas Junior Pikacha / Nakau\n\nSince 2022, the Sirebe have received five quarterly payments for their forest\nproject. The money should keep flowing until 2045, when the contract comes up\nfor renewal. The payments are made by Nakau, the Pacific-wide, rights-based,\nnonprofit operator that coordinates the Babatana project and works in\ncollaboration with NRDF. Similar payments are in the pipeline for neighboring\ntribes as their projects are verified and added to the Babatana project\nportfolio.\n\nThe Babatana project is owned by the tribes, who also retain their carbon\nrights. This structure, it is hoped, will help the project overcome some of\nthe criticisms aimed at other carbon-trading schemes internationally,\nincluding that they perpetuate extractive colonial dynamics in their dealings\nwith forest people and have led to episodes of conflict and violent\ndispossession. Many experts have been damning of projects\u2019 lack of\nconsultation with local people and transparency, and there is substantial\nevidence that some projects are pure greenwashing.\n\nAmong those critics is the Australian sociologist Kristen Lyons, a\nsustainability and development expert who spent years observing projects in\nEast Africa that failed to deliver what they promised. With her fellow\nUniversity of Queensland sociologist Peter Walters, she\u2019s taken the position\nthat carbon offsets not only enable big industrial polluters to continue\nemitting, they also recruit traditional landowners \u201cas unwitting accomplices\nto this environmental procrastination,\u201d as the scholars wrote in a 2021 book\nchapter.\n\nThe Sirebe forest at dusk. Douglas Junior Pikacha / Nakau\n\nNonetheless, after several years of monitoring the Solomons project, Lyons and\nWalters argue that it is a regionally significant example of best practice for\ncarbon projects in a small nation. \u201cI have been, historically, incredibly\ncritical of carbon offset projects,\u201d Lyons says. But after applying an\nenvironmental justice lens to her study of the Babatana project, she notes,\n\u201cMy view has shifted.\u201d\n\n### ALSO ON YALE E360\n\nIn new scramble for Africa, an Arab sheikh is taking the lead. Read more.\n\nLyons observes that while forest owners should, in theory, be powerful\nstakeholders in a global market worth hundreds of billions of dollars, in\nreality they are often far from equal partners. Indigenous people may struggle\nwith impenetrable jargon from the wrong side of the digital divide, often in\ntheir third or fourth language. But on Choiseul Island, local engagement is\nstrong. Lyons says she has seen communities using money received from the\noffsets for programs that reflect their own priorities, including\nagricultural, sanitation, and education projects, which will provide lasting\nvalue even if the carbon caper goes belly up tomorrow.\n\n\u201cWe need to attend to human rights, particularly Indigenous rights, as we\u2019re\nseeking to attend to the climate crisis,\u201d says Lyons. \u201cAnd so, if local\ncommunities \u2014 particularly Indigenous communities \u2014 are saying this is a\npathway [they] want to explore, I think it would be a terrible thing if there\nwas not the support [for it].\u201d\n\nRangers Ismael Norokesa (left) and Mosses Zoleveke (right). Douglas Junior\nPikacha / Nakau\n\nTheir work in the forest completed, the Pitatamae brothers and Bosma climb\naboard their motorized canoe and slowly navigate down the shallows of the\nKolombangara River, past crocodiles, kingfishers, and flood-eroded banks. Big\nrains used to come once a season but now occur five or six times in\nsuccession, says Linford Pitatamae. The damage is far worse in logged areas,\nwhere floods wash out crops and sediment contaminates clean water and coastal\nfishing grounds.\n\nThis river flows through 330 square miles of lowland, riparian, and montane\nforests that contain some of the richest biodiversity remaining in Solomon\nIslands. On the northern bank lies the 18-square-mile protected area of the\nPadezaka tribe, whose carbon project is in its last stages of verification.\n\u201cThis area is heavily threatened by logging,\u201d Bosma says. \u201cIt\u2019s been quite an\nachievement that they could get it [protected] in time.\u201d Some neighboring\ntribes have let loggers in, and muck from the churned landscape, logging\ncamps, and roads is spilling into the water catchment.\n\nLeaving the river, the canoe picks up speed for the last bumpy leg home, over\nopen ocean, and finally pulls up on the sand at Sasamungga, at the midpoint of\nChoiseul\u2019s south coast. The sprawling village is home to around 1,000 people\nfrom the Sirebe, Siporae, Viru, Padezaka, Garesa, and Lukulombere tribes,\nwhose ancestral forests are inland, in the river country we\u2019ve just left. Like\nmany Pacific forest people, they have over the decades drifted to hubs like\nSasamungga to access education, markets, health services, transportation, and\njobs.\n\nA male oriole whistler on a forest ranger's hand. Douglas Junior Pikacha /\nNakau\n\nOnly about 10 percent of the small but growing Sirebe population have paid\nemployment outside the village, Linford Pitatamae says, so most of the\ncommunity have had a hand-to-mouth village life, relying on what they could\nearn from fishing and agriculture. Now, their carbon project sells around\n17,423 credits a year on the international market under a deal extending 30\nyears. It takes in roughly $263,350 a year, of which 20 percent goes to NRDF,\n20 percent to Nakau, the project coordinator, and 60 percent to the 27\nhouseholds of the project owners. In a subsistence economy in one of the\npoorest nations in the Pacific, that\u2019s life-changing income.\n\nOne man put his household\u2019s share into a new outboard motor and insulated\nboxes to store fish for sale. His neighbor invested in equipment for a\nmechanical workshop. Families have installed solar panels and toilets with\nseptic tanks, upgraded their homes, and plumbed water taps that deliver\nrainwater collected in new tanks.\n\nFive percent of payments go into the Sirebe women\u2019s savings club \u2014 $2,360\nevery quarter. Karah Qalo, who founded the club, says the 33 members use it to\npay their children\u2019s school fees, buy materials for their food gardens, invest\nin bakery projects and bee keeping, and run their phones. Their situation is\nradically different from that of women from forest communities that have been\nlogged. Local custom largely holds that only men have authority over the land,\nwhile women have only the right to use the land \u2014 including for gardening,\nfirewood, or water collection. When male leaders allow loggers in, says Qalo,\nthey get cash, but the women lose everything. \u201cThe water will be polluted, air\npollution, everything will not be good because of the pollution of the\nmachines.\u201d\n\nCup fungus (left) and a Woodford's fruit bat (right) in the Sirebe forest.\nDouglas Junior Pikacha / Nakau\n\nCarbon marketeers usually describe the carbon that is sequestered and traded\nas the core benefit of their business and any positive social or economic\noutcomes for local people as co-benefits. But Nakau chief operating officer\nAlex McClean argues that from the perspective of forest people, \u201cthe carbon is\nclose to irrelevant. What matters to them are improvements to their life and\nlivelihoods.\u201d He likes to turn the measure of integrity on its head, so things\nlike jobs for rangers and funds that empower women become core benefits, with\ncarbon reduction the icing on the cake.\n\nBut carbon market pioneer Mark Trexler, while not commenting specifically on\nthe Nakau model, questions this approach, and the application of an\nenvironmental justice lens to carbon projects. \u201c\u2018High integrity\u2019 in the offset\nspace has to refer to climate change mitigation benefits,\u201d he says, not to co-\nbenefits including forest community impacts. \u201cIf voluntary markets become seen\nprimarily as a way to send money to impacted communities, we\u2019re talking about\ncarbon contributions, not offsets.\u201d\n\nNakau CEO Robbie Henderson says demand for the Babatana project is strong and\nthat \u201cwe could definitely sell our credits several times over at the moment.\u201d\nSome buyers don\u2019t use those credits to offset anything, he says, but rather to\ndemonstrate their environmental commitment. Some agree not to claim carbon\nneutrality; some offset residual emissions. An exclusion list prohibits the\nsale of credits to support any fossil fuel expansion.\n\nRanger Clinton Gatavae. Douglas Junior Pikacha / Nakau\n\nLinford Pitatamae recalls plenty of skepticism when he and Wilko Bosma started\ntalking to the community about the crazy notion of selling their forest, but\nnot their trees. \u201cAt first, we didn\u2019t think this was a real project,\u201d\nPitatamae says. \u201cThe community didn\u2019t really understand.\u201d It took years of\n\u201ccontinuous engagement, training, [and raising] awareness\u201d to win support, he\nsays, then more years to work through the hurdles of verification and\ncertification to get to this point. Now he\u2019s hearing from landowners across\nthe island, and the nation, who are hungry to learn more.\n\n### MORE ON YALE E360\n\nIn Tanzania, carbon offsets preserve forests and a way of life.

Our birds are still there. Our sacred places are still there.\u201d\nHe spends long hours most days locked away from the forest he loves, grinding\nthrough the paperwork and complexities of keeping this enterprise going. But\nhe\u2019s not complaining. \u201cThis is the right path for rural Solomons to follow,\u201d\nhe says.\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Email\n\nJo Chandler is an award-winning environmental journalist whose work has\nappeared in The Guardian, The New York Times, and The Atlantic, among others.\nShe teaches at the Centre for Advancing Journalism at the University of\nMelbourne.
