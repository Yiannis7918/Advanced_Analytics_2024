The AI had more instances of\nincorrect reasoning than the doctors did but scored better overall.\n\n## METHODOLOGY:\n\n  * The study involved 39 physicians from two academic medical centers in Boston and the generative AI model GPT-4.\n  * Participants were presented with 20 simulated clinical cases involving common problems such as pharyngitis, headache, abdominal pain, cough, and chest pain. Each case included sections describing the triage presentation, review of systems, physical examination, and diagnostic testing.\n  * The primary outcome was the Revised-IDEA (R-IDEA) score, a 10-point scale evaluating clinical reasoning documentation across four domains: Interpretive summary, differential diagnosis, explanation of the lead diagnosis, and alternative diagnoses.\n\n## TAKEAWAY:\n\n  * AI achieved a median R-IDEA score of 10, higher than attending physicians (median score, 9) and residents (8).\n  * The chatbot had a significantly higher estimated probability of achieving a high R-IDEA score of 8-10 (0.99) compared with attendings (0.76) and residents (0.56).\n  * AI provided more responses that contained instances of incorrect clinical reasoning (13.8%) than residents (2.8%) and attending physicians (12.5%). It performed similarly to physicians in diagnostic accuracy and inclusion of cannot-miss diagnoses.\n\n## IN PRACTICE:\n\n\"Future research should assess clinical reasoning of the LLM-physician\ninteraction, as LLMs will more likely augment, not replace, the human\nreasoning process,\" the authors of the study wrote.\n\n## SOURCE:\n\nAdam Rodman, MD, MPH, with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, was\nthe corresponding author on the paper. The research was published online on\nApril 1, 2024, in JAMA Internal Medicine.\n\n## LIMITATIONS:\n\nSimulated clinical cases may not replicate performance in real-world\nscenarios. Further training could enhance the performance of the AI, so the\nstudy may underestimate its capabilities, the researchers noted.\n\n## DISCLOSURES:\n\nThe study was supported by the Harvard Clinical and Translational Science\nCenter and Harvard University. Authors disclosed financial ties to publishing\ncompanies and Solera Health. Rodman received funding from the Gordon and Betty\nMoore Foundation.\n\nSUGGESTED FOR YOU\n\nThis article was created using several editorial tools, including AI, as part\nof the process.
