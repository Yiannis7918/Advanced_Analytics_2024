Vygodsky\n\nPublication date\n\n    1987\n\nTopics\n\n    mathematics, partial differential equations, calculus, analytic geometry, curves, series, analysis, reference books, mir publishers\n\nPublisher\n\n    Mir Publishers\n\nCollection\n\n    mir-titles; additional_collections\n\nLanguage\n\n    English\n\nThis handbook is a continuation of the Handbook of Elementary Mathematics by\nthe same author and includes material usually studied in mathematics courses\nof higher educational institutions.\n\nThe designation of this handbook is two fold.\n\nFirstly, it is a reference work in which the reader can find definitions (what\nis a vector product?) and factual information, such as how to find the surface\nof a solid of revolution 6r how to expand a function in a trigonometrie\nseries, and so on. Definitions, theorems, rules and formulas (accompanied by\nexamples and practical hints) are readily found by reference to the\ncomprehensive index or table of contents.\n\nSecondly, the handbook is intended for systematic reading. It does not take\nthe place of a textbook and so full proofs are only given in exceptional\ncases. However, it can well serve as material for a first acquaintance with\nthe subject. For this purpose, detailed explanations are given of basic\nconcepts, such as that of a scalar product (Sec. 104), limit (Secs. 203~206),\nthe differential (Secs. 228-235), or infinite series (Secs. 270, 366-370). Ail\nrules are abundantly illustra- ted with examples, which form an integral part\nof the hand book (see Secs. 50-62, 134, 149, 264-266, 369, 422, 498, and\nothers). Explanations indicate how to proceed when a rule ceases to be valid;\nthey also point out errors to be avoided (see Secs. 290, 339, 340, 379, and\nothers).\n\nThe theorems and rules are also accompanied by a wide range of explanatory\nmaterial. In some cases, emphasis is placed on bringing out the content of a\ntheorem to facilitate a grasp of the proof. At other times, special examples\nare illustrated and tne reasoning is such as to provide a complete proof of\nthe theorem if applied to the general case (see Secs. 148, 149, 369, 374).\nOccasionally, the explanation simply refers the reader to the sections on\nwhich the proof is based. Material given in small print may be omitted in a\nfirst read ing;; however, this does not mean it is not important.\n\nConsiderable attention has been paid to the historical background of\nmathematical entities, their origin and develop ment. This very often helps\nthe user to place the subject matter in its proper perspective. Of particular\ninterest in this respect are Secs. 270, 366 together with Secs. 271, 383, 399,\nand 400, which, it is hoped, will give the reader a clearer understanding of\nTaylor\u2019s series than is usually obtainable in a formai exposition. Also,\nbiographical information from the lives of mathematicians has been included\nwhere deemed advisable.\n\nFifth Reprinting 1987\n\nMir Publishers Moscow\n\nTranslated from the Russian by George Yankovsky\n\nContents\n\nPLANE ANALYTIC GEOMETRY\n\n1\\.
