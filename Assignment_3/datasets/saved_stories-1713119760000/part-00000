President and CEO John Donahoe.\n\nSource: Nike\n\nNike CEO John Donahoe on Friday blamed remote work for the company falling\nbehind on innovation, saying that it\u2019s tough to be disruptive when people are\nworking from home.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC\u2019s Sara Eisen from Paris, Donahoe was asked about the\ncompany\u2019s lack of fresh new products in its assortment, which had been a\nconcern among investors.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s been missing is the kind of bold, disruptive innovation that Nike\u2019s\nknown for and when we look back, the reasons are fairly straightforward,\u201d said\nDonahoe.\n\nHe pointed out that footwear factories in Vietnam were forced to shutter\nduring the Covid-19 pandemic but said \u201ceven more importantly,\u201d Nike\u2019s\nemployees worked from home for 2.5 years.\n\n\u201cIn hindsight, it turns out, it\u2019s really hard to do bold, disruptive\ninnovation, to develop a boldly disruptive shoe on Zoom,\u201d Donahoe said. \u201cOur\nteams came back together 18 months ago in person, and we recognize this. So we\nrealigned our company, and over the last year we have been ruthlessly focused\non rebuilding our disruptive innovation pipeline along with our iterative\ninnovation pipeline.\u201d\n\nVIDEO12:0912:09\n\nWatch CNBC\u2019s full interview with Nike CEO John Donahoe on the 2024 Olympics\nand facing competition\n\nSquawk on the Street\n\nDonahoe said Nike\u2019s innovation pipeline \u201cis as strong as ever,\u201d and consumers\ncan expect to start seeing new product drops each season, as well as the fresh\nstorytelling the brand has long been known for.\n\nThe chief executive\u2019s comments come at a tough time for the company. Some\nanalysts and investors have criticized the sneaker giant for falling behind on\ninnovation and losing market share to upstarts like On Running and Hoka, which\nhave won over a new generation of runners and have grown rapidly in recent\nyears.\n\nIn December, Nike announced a broad restructuring plan to reduce costs by\nabout $2 billion over the next three years. It also cut its sales guidance as\nit warned of softer demand in the quarters ahead.\n\nTwo months later, it said it was shedding 2% of its workforce, or more than\n1,500 jobs, so it could invest in its growth areas, such as running, the\nwomen\u2019s category and the Jordan brand.\n\nDonahoe insisted Friday that Nike is still \u201cgaining share\u201d and remains a\ndominant force in running and all things sport.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done more to advance running than any brand in the world over the last\n50 years and we continue to lead with elite runners,\u201d said Donahoe when asked\nabout On Running and Hoka. \u201cInnovation has always been what\u2019s marked Nike in\nrunning, as in other categories and so we\u2019re not just going to copy what other\npeople do, we\u2019re gonna bring innovation.\u201d\n\n  * Subscribe to CNBC PRO\n  * Subscribe to Investing Club\n  * Licensing & Reprints\n  * CNBC Councils\n  * Supply Chain Values\n  * CNBC on Peacock\n  * Join the CNBC Panel\n  * Digital Products\n  * News Releases\n  * Closed Captioning\n  * Corrections\n  * About CNBC\n  * Internships\n  * Site Map\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Careers\n  * Help\n  * Contact\n\n  * #### News Tips\n\nGot a confidential news tip?
