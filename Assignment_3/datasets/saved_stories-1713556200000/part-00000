It's fast. And it's fun!\n\nTech Conferences: Does Your Employer Pay?\n\nDoes your employer pay for you to attend tech conferences?\n\nYes, registration and travel are comped.\n\nYes, just registration but not travel expenses.\n\nYes, travel expenses but not registration.\n\nOnly virtual conferences.\n\nNo reimbursement.\n\nWe'd love to hear what you think.\n\nFermyon sponsored this post. Fermyon is under common control with TNS.\n\nAt Wasm I/O in Barcelona and KubeCon in Paris, several updates regarding\nWebAssembly (Wasm) were announced. From these, four big patterns emerged.\n\n## Programming Language Support Is Booming\n\nSince its inception, the biggest risk to Wasm\u2019s success has been lack of\nsupport from programming languages. Even the best cross-platform bytecode\nformat cannot succeed if no languages compile to that format.\n\nI\u2019ve been keeping track of language support in WebAssembly for a long time. In\nparticular, I track how many of the top 20 languages, according to RedMonk,\nare adopting WebAssembly. Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Ruby, Rust, C/C++ and\nZig have all made the Wasm move, and other languages are on their way.\n\nAt Wasm I/O, JetBrains\u2019 Zalim Bashorov reported on the rapid progress of\nKotlin. In addition to being a popular language in its own right, Kotlin\nrepresents the most progressive elements of the Java world. With Kotlin\nnearing WebAssembly core support and WASI 0.2 support, I expect that the\npopularity of the language will gain another boost as it finds a new target\ndeveloper audience. More than that, it will draw the larger Java community\ntoward WebAssembly.\n\nDart now ships with a WebAssembly compile target. At Wasm I/O, Kevin Moore of\nGoogle shared the exciting developments in the Dart and Flutter world. Moore\ndid not give the impression that Dart would extend its reach beyond its\nbrowser and mobile app roots, but the performance boon that Wasm brings to\nthat world is fantastic. Moore showed benchmarks indicating that Wasm\nexecution can be over 50% faster than JavaScript-based execution times.\n\nFermyon is the first cloud-native WebAssembly FaaS that lets developers build\nbetter serverless apps faster. Focused on empowering cloud developers to\nquickly realize the things they are thinking about creating and focus on the\ncode that brings value instead of the obligatory foundation code. Insight\nPartners is an investor in Fermyon and TNS.\n\nLearn More\n\nThe latest from Fermyon\n\nStartup Lessons from 25 Years and 5 Startups\n\n18 April 2024\n\nPython, Wasm, and Componentize-Py\n\n16 April 2024\n\nFermyon Platform For Kubernetes Part 2: Enterprise Architectures and Patterns\n\n10 April 2024\n\nZoom\n\nFinally, the Go team, represented by Rajiv Singh and Achille Roussel, covered\nthe new developments in Go\u2019s WebAssembly support. Go has ceded some of its\nWebAssembly support to TinyGo (and Ron Evans, head of that project, also\npresented at Wasm I/O). But the core Go team now has a renewed interest in\nsupporting Wasm both in and out of the browser.\n\nTRENDING STORIES\n\n  1. 4 Big Developments in WebAssembly\n  2. WebAssembly Adoption: Is Slow and Steady Winning the Race?\n  3. New Wasm Project Brings Web Components to Backend Languages\n  4. Python and WebAssembly: Elevating Performance for Web Apps\n  5. WebAssembly and Go: A Guide to Getting Started (Part 1)\n\nOne more major feature of programming language support, though, is\ndebuggability. Microsoft\u2019s Natalia Venditto and Ralph Squillace demonstrated\nWasm debugging inside of Visual Studio Code. Language-neutral Wasm debugging\nis an absolute must for modern software development, and Microsoft is hard at\nwork on making this a reality.\n\n## Kubernetes Is the Destination for WebAssembly Deployments\n\nBoth Wasm I/O and KubeCon were abuzz about running Wasm inside of Kubernetes.\nFermyon, Microsoft, SUSE, Liquid Reply and others collectively released the\nopen source SpinKube project for running Spin-flavored Wasm Kubernetes\napplications. And at KubeCon, international optics company ZEISS Group showed\npractical use cases on the keynote stage.\n\nSUSE announced Rancher Desktop support for WebAssembly, using its K3s\nKubernetes runtime. Fermyon announced a commercially supported, ultra-dense\nFermyon Platform for Kubernetes, capable of running 5,000 Wasm apps per\nKubernetes node. Cloud Native Computing Foundation\u2019s wasmCloud project reached\n1.0, and supports Kubernetes integration. And NGINX Unit announced support for\nrunning Spin apps inside of its application platform.\n\nAfter the KubeCon keynote on WebAssembly, EMA analyst Torsten Volk noted that\nWasm had trended to the most discussed topic of the conference.\n\nWhat is it about Wasm that meshes so well with Kubernetes? Wasm\u2019s cold start\ntimes make it an excellent platform for lambda-like serverless functions.\nKubernetes users have long had an interest in running such workloads inside of\nthe cluster, but the first wave of Kubernetes serverless solutions could not\nmatch the density, performance and startup speed of Wasm.\n\n## The Component Model Gets Real\n\nThere were eight sessions on the WebAssembly Component Model at Wasm I/O this\nyear. While last year\u2019s Wasm I/O covered the component model in a largely\ntheoretical way, this year we saw the impact one year of development has had\non components.\n\nZoom\n\nI particularly enjoyed the three-session series with Fermyon\u2019s Thorsten Hans\nshowing polyglot programming with components, Ryan Levick explaining the\nwherefore and why of components, and Luke Wagner finishing the triad with a\nsession on asynchronous calls between components (a yet-to-be-completed part\nof WASI).\n\nThere were other sessions focused on using components to accomplish specific\ntasks by InfinyOn\u2019s Sejyo Chang, Design Systems\u2019 Pierre Dureau, Dilla.io\u2019s\nJean Valverde, Cosmonic\u2019s Taylor Thomas and others. Taken in aggregate, it is\nnow clear that the component model is ready for use.\n\nThe most important component-related development, though, came from F5\u2019s Oscar\nSpencer and JAF Labs\u2019 Danny Macovei. Work on defining a component registry has\nbeen ongoing for the last three years, but at the end of Wasm I/O\u2019s first day,\nMacovei and Spencer launched WA.dev, the first Wasm component registry. It\u2019s\nfair to compare WA.dev to npm or even Docker Hub. Developers can upload their\ncomponents to a central registry that makes discovery and management of\ncomponents easy for us all.\n\n## Wasm Is Still a Pioneering Language\n\nPerhaps the last development is an anti-trend. Language support is falling in\nline. Kubernetes and Wasm are hitting stride. The Wasm Component Model\nspecification is finding its way into practical tooling. These are all signs\nof maturation and stability. However, Wasm has not stagnated; there\u2019s still an\nelement of ongoing exploration.\n\nNothing illustrates this better than the Wanix project, which independent\ndevelopers Jeff Lindsay and Julian Del Signore introduced on the second day of\nWasm I/O. Lindsay is a visionary\u2019s visionary whose projects frequently force\nsoftware developers to rethink their assumptions about how things can be done.\nFrom inventing webhooks to his prolific early contributions in the container\nspace, Lindsay has pushed boundaries. Wanix is no exception.\n\nDel Signore and Lindsay showed an in-browser, Plan9-inspired operating system\nthat powered a CMS-like system capable of syncing state to GitHub. It was a\nfantastic example of how Wasm\u2019s versatility, performance and cross-platform\nnature can combine to build a class of tool for which there currently is no\nname.\n\nIn a similar vein, Daniel Lopez, former head of Wasm Labs at VMware, took the\naudience on a fun-filled ride when he showed a variety of demos. From running\nWindows 95 in the browser to demonstrating AI inferencing, Lopez pointed to a\nvariety of interesting applications of this highly versatile technology. Among\nthe most humorous moments, Lopez showed how Docker could be run inside of\nWasm, adding multiple layers of virtualization. The guiding strand of his\npresentation, though, is that Wasm is not to be pigeonholed.\n\nOn the last day of Wasm I/O, Ron Evans, creator of TinyGo (among other\nthings), introduced an open source framework for Internet of Things (IoT)\nembedded development. Powered by Wasm, Mechanoid supports embedded development\nin a wide variety of programming languages, including Rust, Go and Zig. IoT is\na burgeoning area for WebAssembly. While it has already gained a foothold in\nentertainment devices, Evans explored using it in microcontrollers, pushing\nWasm down to classes of tiny devices.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn many ways, Wasm has shown its maturation. Almost all mainstream languages\nnow support WebAssembly. Kubernetes is proving to be a popular environment for\nhosting Wasm applications, and the WebAssembly Component Model is unlocking\nthe revolutionary possibilities of WebAssembly, including true polyglot\nprogramming.\n\nBut just as Java found use cases beyond its original intent, we also see Wasm\nopportunities opening up in fascinating areas like IoT as well as emerging\nareas like Wanix. This serves as a good reminder that maturity does not entail\nstagnation.\n\nMatt Butcher is the co-founder and CEO of Fermyon, the WebAssembly in the\nCloud company.
