As a video of the incident\nclearly shows, however, the car\u2019s destruction was hardly the work of a single\nindividual. Instead, a wild mob can be seen spray painting the car, striking\nit with skateboards and other objects, and just generally abusing it. Amid the\nfuror, one person shouted: \u201cLight that shit on fire!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Related Content\n\nCrowd Sets Waymo Self-Driving Car on Fire: \u2018They Couldn\u2019t Even Recognize the\nVehicle\u2019\n\nWaymo Driverless Car Crashes Into Human Cyclist in San Francisco\n\nMarlo Kelly on Portraying Tatiana in 3 Body Problem\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\n3 Body Problem's Marlo Kelly Breaks Down Her Sinister and Complex Character\n\nWell, someone eventually did. At some point, someone had the bright idea to\nthrow a firework inside the car and watch it go up like a Roman candle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe San Francisco Standard now reports that a SFPD Arson Task Force has\nidentified a 14-year-old as the suspect who threw the firework and lit the car\non fire. The teenager was identified as the result of a search warrant\nrecently served at his residence, and the District Attorney\u2019s Office has now\nfiled charges against them. Due to their age, the person has not been publicly\nidentified.\n\nThe car\u2019s fiery demise occurred in February amidst heightened tensions between\nthe city\u2019s autonomous vehicle population and local humans. Indeed, ever since\nthe state of California authorized the expanded rollout of commercial robotaxi\nservices in the city last summer, a certain percentage of San Franciscans have\ntreated the vehicles like an invading horde that must be violently repelled.\nIn August of last year, an activist group calling themselves the Safe Street\nRebels began obstructing the path of robotaxis with traffic cones out of\nprotest. Then, in September, a man was caught smashing a Cruise taxi\u2019s\nwindshield with a hammer for no apparent reason.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere have also been a few episodes of car-on-human violence. Last October,\none of GM Cruise\u2019s self-driving robotaxis ran a woman over and dragged her.\nThe incident subsequently led to the company temporarily shutting down its\noperations in the city and its CEO later resigned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n", "frontpage": false}
