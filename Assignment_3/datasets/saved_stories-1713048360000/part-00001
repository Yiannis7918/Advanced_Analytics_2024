Prevent overblocking by utilizing the law of diminishing returns (e.g., using sane, quality blocklists; allowing most TLDs; etc.).\n  2. Pass the girlfriend test with few exceptions. These deviations are documented throughout the guide.\n\n## Create your account\n\nSign up for NextDNS here and support this page!\n\n# Security \ud83d\udc6e\n\nSecurity settings protect your data from harm, theft, and unauthorized\nuse.^^why does this matter?\n\n## Threat Intelligence Feeds ^^1\n\nUse Threat Intelligence Feeds\n\n## AI-Driven Threat Detection ^^1\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f This feature is still in beta and may cause false positives.\n\nEnable AI-Driven Threat Detection\n\n## Google Safe Browsing ^^ 1 2 3 4\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Unlike the version embedded in some browsers, this does not associate your\npublic IP address to threats and does not allow bypassing the block.\n\nEnable Google Safe Browsing\n\n## Cryptojacking Protection ^^1\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f If you use something other than the recommended blocklists, then you should\nleave this enabled.\n\nEnable Cryptojacking Protection\n\n## DNS Rebinding Protection ^^1 2\n\nEnable DNS Rebinding Protection\n\n## IDN Homograph Attacks Protection ^^1 2\n\nEnable Homograph Attacks Protection\n\n## Typosquatting Protection ^^1\n\nEnable Typosquatting Protection\n\n## Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) Protection\n\nEnable DGA Protection\n\n## Block Newly Registered Domains (NRDs) ^^1\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Blocking NRDs may cause false positives occasionally. Be selective when\nadding NRDs to your allowlist; and, if you do, NEVER give sensitive\ninformation to a NRD. If you plan to set-and-forget your configuration,\ndisable this setting.\n\nBlock Newly Registered Domains (NRDs)\n\n## Block Dynamic DNS Hostnames ^^1 2\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f This feature is still in beta and may cause false positives.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 If you are using Dynamic DNS (DDNS), this setting will not block the DDNS\nservices' own website or their update API.\n\nEnable Block Dynamic DNS Hostnames\n\n## Block Parked Domains ^^1\n\nBlock Parked Domains\n\n## Block Top-Level Domains (TLDs) ^^1 2 3 4 5\n\nUpdated: 18 March 2024\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Blocking TLDs may cause false positives since this feature blocks both site\nnavigations and subrequests. However, the entries below should allow for\neveryday browsing while offering protection against commonly abused TLDs since\nthey have no known legitimate uses.\n\n\ud83d\uded1 You can find additional TLDs on Most Abused TLDs, but you may need to\nallowlist sites on occasion. If you plan to set-and-forget your configuration,\nskip this setting.\n\n## Block Child Sexual Abuse Material\n\nBlock Child Sexual Abuse Material\n\n# Privacy \ud83d\udd12\n\nPrivacy features limit the amount of data companies can collect about you.\n\nBecause privacy is a spectrum, what you need varies on your threat model,\ninterest, and skillset.^^why should I care? I have nothing to hide\n\n## Blocklists ^^1\n\nBlocklists filter out ads, trackers, and malicious sites. Hundreds of\nvolunteers contribute to these lists in the open-source community, and they\nare the undercover heroes who make blocking ads at scale possible.\n\nWe recommend you remove the NextDNS Ads & Trackers Blocklist and select the\nminimum number of useful lists.\n\n### Which blocklist should I use?\n\nA great question to ask is: \"How much do I want to deal with the\ninconveniences of false positives?\"\n\nHere are the suggested blocklists, based on past issues and observations:\n\nBlocklist| Rationale  \n---|---  \nHaGeZi - Multi NORMAL^1| Block tracker, ad, and badware requests without\nissues (set-and-forget).  \nHaGeZi - Multi PRO^2| Block more requests, usually without issues\n(recommended).  \nHaGeZi - Multi PRO++^3| Block more requests at the risk of site breakage.\nReport occasional site and app issues.  \n  \n\ud83d\udcd6 Check out Hagezi's own recommendations.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 You can use different blocklists on separate DNS profiles (e.g., NORMAL for\nyour router and PRO++ for your web browser).\n\n### Why Hagezi?\n\nHagezi block ads, trackers, native device trackers, badware, and more. He\nmaintains a sensible allowlist, handles false positives quickly, and\ncommunicates known issues to blocklists maintainers. Hagezi's primary DNS\nlists combine respected community blocklists like OISD, Steven Black, 1Hosts,\nnotrack, and more.\n\n\u2753 You may wonder why other lists are not utilized. This is because many list\nmaintainers:\n\n  * do not remove false positives and/or are no longer active ^1 2\n  * already aggregate common blocklists into their own list (Easylist/Fanboy, AdGuard, Steven Black, etc.) ^1 2 3 4\n  * offer no meaningful additional coverage when compared with the chart combinations above\n\n## Native Tracking Protection ^^1\n\nAdd all the device brands you use. There's no advantage in adding brands you\ndon't have; however, there\u2019s no disadvantage in adding unused brands, either.\n\n## Block Disguised Third-Party Trackers ^^1 2 3 4 5\n\nBlock Disguised Third-Party Trackers\n\n## Allow Affiliate & Tracking Links ^^1 2\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Your IP address will automatically be hidden (via TCP proxying) to preserve\nyour privacy.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Disabling causes false positives when opening some email links.\n\nAllow Affiliate & Tracking Links\n\n# Parental Control \ud83d\udc68\ud83d\udc69\ud83d\udc66\n\n## YouTube Restricted Mode\n\nEnforce YouTube Restricted Mode\n\n## Block Bypass Methods ^^1\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Enabling may cause unintended breakage.\n\nBlock Bypass Methods\n\n# Denylist \u26d4\n\nDenylist entries are always blocked. The entries below may further harden some\nprofiles while not interfering with everyday browsing.\n\n# Allowlist \u2705\n\nAllowlist entries always resolve. These entries may be needed for aggressive\nDNS profiles to relax their rules.\n\n# Settings \u2699\ufe0f\n\n## Logs\n\nStorage location \u2192 Switzerland\n\n## Block Page\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Enabling may cause breakage if the NextDNS Root CA is not on your devices.\nThis setting also breaks Paypal 2FA, iCloud Private Relay, Microsoft Teams,\nYahoo! Mail, the NAVER app, Hoyolab app, and possibly banking apps.\n\nEnable Block Page\n\n## Anonymized EDNS Client Subnet ^^1\n\nEnable Anonymized EDNS Client Subnet\n\n## Cache Boost ^^1\n\nEnable Cache Boost\n\n## CNAME Flattening ^^1 2 3\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Enabling this feature could break compatibility with Yahoo! Mail and cause\nissues with some blocklists.\n\nEnable CNAME Flattening\n\n## Web3 ^^ 1 2\n\nEnable Web3 \u2192 (optional)\n\n# FAQ \u2753\n\n## How do I signup for NextDNS?\n\nClick here!\n\n## Why am I still seeing ads?\n\nNot all ads can be blocked at the DNS level.^1 2 You will need an ad blocker\nto block what's leftover.\n\nThis is because not all ads come from third-party domains; some ads come\ndirectly from the site you're visiting, like YouTube. DNS blockers stop the\nresolution of a domain, and content blockers filter page content. Click here\nto easily install a lightweight ad blocker.\n\n## I need a browser with ad blocking. Which one should I choose?\n\nChoosing a browser is about as intimate as choosing a starter Pok\u00e9mon, so\nhere's a few caveats:\n\n  * The best browser on paper may not work well in real world usage.\n  * Browsers are tools! Use a variety of browsers depending on what you need to do.\n  * You should use various browsers (or browser profiles) for different areas of life (e.g., work, school, personal).\n\nWe based the recommendations below on a combination of effectiveness, resource\nefficiency, features, and ease of use.\n\nOS| Browser| Content Blocker  \n---|---|---  \niOS| Safari| AdGuard  \nAndroid| Brave| Built-in blocker  \nWindows macOS Linux| Firefox (with Betterfox)Brave| uBlock OriginBuilt-in\nblocker or uBlock Origin  \n  \nAt the end of the day, if you're using NextDNS + any browser with an ad\nblocker, you have more coverage than most people.\n\n## Should I pay for NextDNS?\n\nFor the rich features it provides, NextDNS is very affordable at $19.90/year\nfor unlimited devices. NextDNS pays for itself if it saves my family from a\nmalicious incident.\n\n## Does the amount of features enabled affect the speed of NextDNS?^1 2\n\nThe number of settings you toggle on will not affect your DNS latency.\n\n## Do I need to set DoH at browser-level if I already use NextDNS at system-\nlevel?\n\nUnless you use a separate profile for the browser, it is not neccessary.\nHowever, I recommend setting it in your web browser anyway.\n\n## I have a router profile and a device profile. Which one does my device use?\n\nThe device will use the profile set by the NextDNS app or the installed root\nCA. However, if the device has not been configured to use a separate profile,\nthen it will use the wifi/router configuration.^1\n\n## What is the difference between security, privacy, and anonymity?\n\nSee article | video\n\n## Does NextDNS hide activity from my Internet Service Provider (ISP)?\n\nDNS protocols like DoH/DoT/DoQ are designed to increase privacy and security\nby encrypting DNS queries. They prevent your ISP from seeing your web searches\nand browsing history, which significantly contributes to protecting your\nprivacy.\n\nHowever, encrypted DNS does not hide the IP addresses of the websites you\nvisit from your ISP. So while they cannot see the content of the encrypted DNS\nquery (i.e., your ISP can't see what specific domain you're trying to access),\nthey can see that you're making a request to a particular DNS server like\nCloudflare or AWS. And if you're constantly sending packets to a particular IP\naddress, it's likely that you're visiting a website hosted at that address.\n\nThat being said, IVPN argues that you only need a VPN for three reasons:\n\nYou don't need a VPN unless your threat model demands it. Here are VPN\nsuggestions from Techlore and Tom Spark Reviews if it does.\n\n# Mentions \ud83d\udcda\n\n### User Comments\n\n  * See here\n\n### YouTube\n\n  * The ULTIMATE Guide to Mastering NextDNS! | clarifications (July 2023)\n\n### Articles\n\n  * Knot Resolver \u2014 with ad blocking (Dec 2022)\n  * Privacy Toolkit: NextDNS (Sept 2022)\n\n### Guides\n\n  * A comprehensive guide to setting up NextDNS (Sept 2023)\n  * FMHY: DNS Adblocking \u2192 NextDNS \u2192 Guide\n  * hagezi/dns-blocklists \u2192 Online DNS services\n\n### Contributions\n\n  * Hagezi | mentions\n  * 1Hosts\n  * Easylist\n  * uBlock Origin\n  * AdGuard\n\nsince 23 July 2022\n\n## About\n\nSetup guide for NextDNS, a DoH proxy with advanced capabilities.\n\n### Topics\n\ndns security tracking privacy blacklist firewall blocklist malware pi-hole ads\ndomains adblock spyware adware trackers dns-over-https doh pihole anti-\ntracking nextdns\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\n### License\n\nGPL-3.0 license\n\nActivity\n\n### Stars\n\n1.2k stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n54 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n37 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Sponsor this project\n\n  * yokoffing Hal\n\n  * ko-fi.com/yokoffing\n  * liberapay.com/yokoffing\n\nLearn more about GitHub Sponsors\n\n## Contributors 12\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
