The app is written entirely in C, with gratuitous calls to the\nObjective-C Runtime.\n\n## Features\n\n  * Nibless!\n  * Main.m-less!\n  * Cocoa-less!\n  * Uses under 1.5 MB of memory at any one time (most of it is used for drawing the window).\n  * A red square in the lower-left-hand corner (drawn in Core Graphics).\n\n## License\n\n  * Absolutely no license. Use it at your own risk, and don't blame me if anything bad happens. Oh, and if you extend it, make sure there isn't any Objective-C in it!\n\n##Important Notes & Bugs\n\n  * The app does not release allocated memory;\n  * There is an implied autoreleasepool, but one is not explicitly created.\n  * A small reliance on __attribute__((constructor)), which is not the best way to do things...\n  * WAY too many framework includes and links to dylibs we don't need.\n  * Built and tested on OS X Lion. Theoretically, it's possible this works on all machines that support the modern ObjC runtime, however, use on older OSes below 10.6 is highly discouraged.\n  * All calls to framework objects are compliant with OS X 10.0+, however the code will only run on intel architectures. This will be remedied first.\n\n## About\n\nDigging a Foundation With A Spoon\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\nActivity\n\n### Stars\n\n130 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n11 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n15 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases\n\nNo releases published\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Languages\n\n  * C 70.5%\n  * Objective-C 29.5%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
