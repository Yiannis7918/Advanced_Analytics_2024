Paired with a Binutils patch, this allows a toolchain that\ncan successfully build working binaries targeting the aarch64-gnu platform.\n\nThe patch notes:\n\n> \"Coupled with a corresponding binutils patch, this produces a toolchain that\n> can sucessfully build working binaries targeting aarch64-gnu.\"\n\nBut given the tough state of GNU Hurd hardware support, this AArch64 work is\npresumably only beneficial in the semi near-term for 64-bit ARM VMs if\nanything. Right now there isn't any working GNU Hurd AArch64 for users. In\nHurd's 2024-Q1 update it was noted:\n\n> \"Last time, there was no AArch64 port of GNU Mach, and so the only testing I\n> have done was running a simple statically-linked executable on Linux under\n> GDB, which, nevertheless, helped me identify and fix a number of issues.\n>\n> Since then, however, I have been (some may say, relentlessly) working on\n> filling in the missing piece, namely porting GNU Mach (with important help &\n> contributions by Luca D.). I am happy to report that we now have an\n> experimental port of GNU Mach that builds and works on AArch64! While that\n> may sound impressive, note that various things about it are in an extremely\n> basic, proof-of-concept state rather than being seriously production-ready;\n> and also that Mach is a small kernel (indeed, a microkernel), and it was\n> designed from the start (back in the 80s) to be portable, so most of the\n> \"buisness logic\" functionality (virtual memory, IPC,\n> tasks/threads/scheduler) is explicitly arch-independent.\n>\n> Despite the scary \"WIP proof-of-concept\" status, there is enough\n> functionality in Mach to run userland code, handle exceptions and syscalls,\n> interact with the MMU to implement all the expected virtual memory\n> semantics, schedule/switch tasks and threads, and so on. Moreover, all of\n> GNU Mach's userspace self-tests pass!\n>\n> This meant there was enough things in place for me to try running glibc on\n> it, and the amazing thing is my simple test executable, the same one I\n> previously tested on Linux with GDB, just worked on real Mach without me\n> having to make any additional changes to the glibc side, or even recompile\n> it.\n>\n> But I did not stop there, and I got several of the core Hurd servers\n> working! Namely, these are ext2fs, exec, startup, auth, and proc servers.\n> All of them but ext2fs are dynamically linked; ld aarch64.so.1 successfully\n> locates and maps the programs themselves and their required dependencies,\n> and Mach pages in code and data pages from ext2fs as they are accessed,\n> transparently to the program, just as one would expect it to.\"\n\nGNU Hurd still has a long ways to go in being useful especially as it concerns\nbare metal hardware support.\n\n18 Comments\n\nRelated News\n\nGCC 14 Boasts Nice ASCII Art For Visualizing Buffer Overflows\n\nGNU Poke 4.0 & Poke-ELF 1.0 Released For Dealing With Binary Data\n\nGNU Coreutils 9.5 Can Yield 10~20% Throughput Boost For cp, mv & cat Commands\n\nIBM Posts GCC Patches For -mcpu=power11 Support\n\nGNU Linux-libre 6.8-gnu Dealing With Blobs From New Intel Drivers\n\nGNUnet 0.21 Rolls Out New Transport Layer For Building Decentralized,\nDistributed Apps\n\nAbout The Author\n\nMichael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site\nin 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.
