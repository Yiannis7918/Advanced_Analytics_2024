At 3:20 pm EDT,\ntotality begins and the sun will be completely blocked by the moon and this\nwill last for roughly 3 minutes and 38 seconds and is the safest time to view\nthe event. By 4:33 pm EDT, the moon will have passed the sun ending the event.\nEveryone knows not to look at the sun while the eclipse is taking place, but\ncan you use your phone to take a picture while the eclipse is happening?\n\nThe answer is a resounding \"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\" according to NASA (via XDA). If\nyou point your camera at the sun during the eclipse, you could damage some of\nthe components inside your phone. I know it's hard to believe, but the\neggheads at NASA actually have an \"X\" account and the agency explains why you\nshouldn't just direct the camera on your phone to shoot photos of the eclipse\nunprotected.\n\n\"We asked our @NASAHQPhoto team, and the answer is yes, the phone sensor could\nbe damaged just like any other image sensor if it\u2019s pointed directly at the\nsun. This is especially true if you\u2019re using any sort of magnifying lens\nattachment on the phone. You would need to utilize the proper filters just\nlike on any other camera. The best practice would be to hold a pair of eclipse\nglasses in front of your phone\u2019s lenses when photographing the Sun at any\npoint other than totality.\"\n\n> We asked our @NASAHQPhoto team, and the answer is yes, the phone sensor\n> could be damaged just like any other image sensor if it\u2019s pointed directly\n> at the Sun.

That's the kind of brilliant response that\nyou'd expect from men and women who carry a slide rule in their pockets.\n\nNASA photographer Bill Ingalls says, \"The real pictures are going to be of the\npeople around you pointing, gawking, and watching it. Those are going to be\nsome great moments to capture to show the emotion of the whole thing.\"\n\nAlan Friedman Mobile Tech News Journalist\n\nAlan, an ardent smartphone enthusiast and a veteran writer at PhoneArena since\n2009, has witnessed and chronicled the transformative years of mobile\ntechnology.
