But with\nhumans clearing habitats, exterminating species and changing the climate, are\nwe now in a sixth mass extinction?\n\nMany researchers claim the sixth mass extinction is underway, with one team\ndescribing \"biological annihilation\" and \"mutilation of the tree of life\" in\ntheir scientific studies. However, others argue that the mass extinction\nhasn't begun yet.\n\nRobert Cowie, a research professor at the University of Hawaii, told Live\nScience that, strictly speaking, you can't declare a mass extinction until\nit's actually happened \u2014 once 75% of species are gone.\n\nA 2022 study led by Cowie and published in the journal Biological Reviews\nestimated that up to 13% of known species have gone extinct since 1500 \u2014 well\nbelow the 75% mass extinction threshold.\n\n\"It hasn't happened yet,\" he said.\n\nSome researchers have estimated that we'll reach the 75% threshold within\n10,000 years, while other studies have concluded that we could be at this grim\nmilestone in just a few centuries \u2014 with the potential for an even shorter\ntime frame if things get worse.\n\nRelated: Scientists just found a hidden 6th mass extinction in Earth's ancient\npast\n\n## Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now\n\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nMass extinctions occur within a short geological time period of less than 2.8\nmillion years, according to the Natural History Museum in London. The\ncenturies to millennia it could take to reach the mass extinction threshold is\nwell within that time frame. So, if you take those estimates as predictive,\nresearchers can argue that the event has already started.\n\n\"We are witnessing the sixth mass extinction in real time,\" Anthony Barnosky,\na professor emeritus of integrative biology at the University of California,\nBerkeley, told Live Science in an email.\n\nStudies have estimated that species are currently going extinct between 100\nand 1,000 times faster than the normal background rate of extinction,\ncalculated based on when species evolve and go extinct in the fossil record.\n\"I think the rate is going to increase as we destroy more of the planet,\"\nCowie said.\n\nBarnosky noted that the species extinction rate may mask the rapid decline in\nwildlife populations because we don't count species as extinct until the last\nindividual is gone. Species are often declared extinct decades after they are\nlast seen in the wild, while others persist with conservation measures when\nmost of their population is dead.\n\n\"We have killed almost 70% of the planet's wild animals since I was born,\"\nBarnosky said. \"Obviously that can't go on too much longer without making the\nsixth mass extinction an actuality.\"\n\nA 2022 WWF report found that monitored vertebrate populations of mammals,\nbirds, amphibians, reptiles and fish declined by an average of 69% between\n1970 and 2018. That figure is a global average; Latin America had the highest\nregional decline, with 94%. Plus, that number doesn't include the more\nnumerous invertebrate species.\n\nData on invertebrate decline is lacking, but some groups have suffered\nstaggering losses. For instance, a 2015 study co-authored by Cowie and\npublished in the journal Conservation Biology highlighted the decline of\nHawaii's Amastridae snails due to invasive species and habitat loss. Of the\n282 species that historically inhabited Hawaii, the researchers could only\nconfirm that 15 were still alive. \"That's a mass extinction,\" Cowie said.\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\n\u2014Critically endangered right whales are shrinking, with drastic consequences\nfor their population\n\n\u2014Mass die-off strikes endangered emperor penguin chicks across 4 of 5 West\nAntarctica colonies\n\n\u2014Polar bear sleeping on tiny iceberg drifting in Arctic sea captured in\nheartbreaking photo\n\nBarnosky described the decimation of biodiversity and burgeoning mass\nextinction as \"the bad news.\" But he said it's not too late to save most\nspecies heading for extinction and thus prevent us from reaching the sixth\nmass extinction threshold.\n\n\"Although we're wiping out populations and species astoundingly fast, we\nhaven't completed the job yet,\" Barnosky said. \"We still have a chance to turn\nthings around, but the window of opportunity for that is slamming shut fast.\"\n\nPatrick Pester\n\nLive Science Contributor\n\nPatrick Pester is a freelance writer and previously a staff writer at Live\nScience.
