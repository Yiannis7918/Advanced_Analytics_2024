Ink, pencil, colored pencil and watercolor on paper, 28 x 19\nin. Private collection.\n\nA parody of Manhattanites\u2019 provincial perception of life beyond the Hudson\nRiver, the cover\u2014and the posters of it sold by the magazine\u2014spawned countless\nimitations and pirated reproductions. Steinberg finally brought suit against\none appropriator and won a large settlement.^82 However, it was not copyright\ninfringement alone that distressed him, but as well\u2014and perhaps more\u2014the\nexclusive identification of his art with that runaway image. Isolating View of\nthe World from the rest of his oeuvre, you miss its larger significance: as\none work within a parade of images that harness the graphic device of the map\nto visualize more than geography. The map for Steinberg is not a system of\ngeographic measurement but a way of thinking.\n\nView of the World itself has forerunners and descendants, beginning with The\nWest Coast.\n\nThe West Coast, 1966. Watercolor, ink, and colored pencil on paper, 14 x 20\nin. Private collection.\n\nThis drawing of 1966 runs in the opposite direction, from the Pacific to the\nAtlantic oceans, with the intervening continent rendered as a schematized\nurban layout of Los Angeles backed by a mountainous terrain, the whole drawn\nin Steinberg\u2019s \u201cdoodle\u201d style\u2014the quasi-geometric designs that filled his\nappointment books and notepads and then migrated to his art as yet another\nfound style for his repertory.\n\nPage from a telephone notepad, early 1960s.

Ink and colored pencil on paper, 19 x 25 in. Morgan\nLibrary & Museum, New York; Gift of The Saul Steinberg Foundation.\n\nIn the later 1980s, Steinberg made a 90-degree turn in a series of drawings\nthat take a bird\u2019s-eye view of North America, Mexico, and sometimes the\nnorthern tip of South America, with the US states (almost but not quite\naccurately placed) presented as a series of overlapping, cascading hillocks\ndescending progressively southward.\n\nUntitled, late 1980s.

Centre Pompidou, Paris; Gift of The Saul Steinberg Foundation.\n\n\u201cOver a plain meanders the river of Steinberg\u2019s life, weaving among dozens of\nplace names sized and sited according to the vagaries of fond or bitter\nmemory: R\u00e2mnicu S\u0103rat (\u2018a place invented for me to be born in\u2019); Tashkent and\nTuba City (\u2018where I bought a hat\u2019), Riverhead and Calcutta, Milan and New\nYork. Here, as so often in a career spanning six decades, Steinberg used a\nlanguage of his own devising to recreate the world in his own image.\u201d^85\n\nAmong other cartographic inventions are maps charting emotional states or\nmarked by angst-ridden road signs and rivers of aspiration.\n\nFlight Map, 1980s.

The Saul\nSteinberg Foundation.\n\nThe three lines of the New York City subway system (BMT, IRT, IND) meander,\nappropriately, through an underground tunnel, but so, in another tunnel, do\nthe CIA and the MVD, its Russian counterpart. Broadcast networks occupy the\nlower sky, the sun is surrounded by airlines; at top, a Steinbergian pairing\nof the SAC, the now-defunct Strategic Air Command, and just above it, LSD.\nIt\u2019s a crafty coupling of American air power and hallucinogens whose\nimplications we are left to ponder.\n\nAnd if maps can service a world beyond cartography, then things in that\nworld\u2014people, furniture, body parts, and even a wheel of cheese\u2014can play the\npart of maps.\n\nUntitled, 1967.

Saul Steinberg Papers, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale\nUniversity.\n\nThe most poignant of Steinberg\u2019s time-maps is the one he produced for a New\nYorker cover in 1997, just as Year 2K anxieties were getting under way.\n\nOriginal drawing for The New Yorker cover, January 6, 1997. 2000, 1996.\nPencil, ink, watercolor, crayon, and collage on paper, 21 1\u20442 x 14 1/8 in.\nMorgan Library & Museum, New York; Gift of The Saul Steinberg Foundation.\n\nThe contorted route from 1997 to 2000 makes for a laborious climb up the hill,\nsuggesting the eighty-three-year-old artist\u2019s doubt about whether he would\nmake it (he didn\u2019t).\n\nIn 1994, Steinberg revisited that pesky 1976 New Yorker cover in a new cover\nthat again explored the idea of the world seen from a provincial perspective.\n\nOriginal drawing for The New Yorker cover, February 13, 1995.

Ultimately, Steinberg\nregarded citizens of the twentieth century as \u2018victims of an immense prank,\nwhich has lasted perhaps since the year of my birth, 1914.\u2019\u201d^86\n\n  * back to: An Architect-on-Paper\n  * continue to: Critical Fortunes\n\n\u00a9 2024 Saul Steinberg Foundation\n\n# design by Condensed\n\nEnable Javascript\n\n", "frontpage": false}
