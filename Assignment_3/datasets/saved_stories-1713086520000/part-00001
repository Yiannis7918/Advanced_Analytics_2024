This paper attempts to address the\n> following questions: What opportunities do the current generation of\n> generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) offer for the developments of\n> noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) technologies? Additionally, what\n> potentials does the forthcoming generation of GPTs possess to push the\n> frontier of research in fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC)? In this\n> paper, we implement a QGAS model, which can rapidly propose promising ansatz\n> architectures and evaluate them with application benchmarks including\n> quantum chemistry and quantum finance tasks. Our results demonstrate that\n> after a limited number of prompt guidelines and iterations, we can obtain a\n> high-performance ansatz which is able to produce comparable results that are\n> achieved by state-of-the-art quantum architecture search methods. This study\n> provides a simple overview of GPT's capabilities in supporting quantum\n> computing research while highlighting the limitations of the current GPT at\n> the same time. Additionally, we discuss futuristic applications for LLM in\n> quantum research.\n\nSubjects:| Quantum Physics (quant-ph)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2307.08191 [quant-ph]  \n(or arXiv:2307.08191v1 [quant-ph] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2307.08191arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Jinglei Cheng [view email] [v1] Mon, 17 Jul 2023 01:39:38 UTC (1,626 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Unleashing the Potential of LLMs for Quantum\nComputing: A Study in Quantum Architecture Design, by Zhiding Liang and 8\nother authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\nquant-ph\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2307\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * INSPIRE HEP\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
