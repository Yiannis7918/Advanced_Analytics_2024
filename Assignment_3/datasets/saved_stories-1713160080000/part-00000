It represents the failure of the de-\nescalation policy on a meta-level and is basically setting the world up for a\nsignificant spread of nuclear weapons. Also, though I\u2019m skeptical, I\u2019m\nactually hearing more positive things about a vote for Ukraine reaching the\nfloor of the House this coming week (or at the latest early next week). Will\njust report what I\u2019m hearing\u2014and hope that its right.\n\nIsraeli missile defense in action last night@\nhttps://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/nation/story/2024-04-13/british-\nmilitary-warns-of-possible-vessel-being-boarded-near-strait-of-hormuz\n\nOne of the largest power plants in the Kyiv area, destroyed by a Russian\nattack this week: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68788110\n\nPhillips\u2019s Newsletter is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts\nand support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.\n\nA Tale of Two Raids: Ukraine Has No Nuclear Weapons So Must Suffer\n\nLast night Israel was attacked by a weapons mix not entirely dissimilar to\nthat which Ukraine is presented with on a regular basis. A range of Iranian\nUAVs (shaheds) cruise missiles and Medium-Range Ballistic Missiles (MRBMs)\nwere used by Iran to attack Israel from a number of different directions. It\nseems that we are talking about a very large raid by Ukrainian standards\u2014but\nnot out all proportions. According to the excellent data being collected by\nJohn Ridge last night\u2019s Iranian raid was the equivalent to two of the largest\nRussian raids on Ukraine. However, it also would be less than Ukraine could be\nattacked with over a week.\n\nAt the same time, this week we have seen the Russians keep up a regular attack\nwith the same weapons mix on Ukraine\u2014with a much lower intercept rate. Indeed,\nthe Ukrainian intercept rate seems to be going down, a worrying sign that\nUkrainian anti-air defenses ammunition stocks are getting depleted. Certainly\nmore Russian missiles seem to be hitting their targets, and in particular the\nUkrainian power grid is being damaged significantly.\n\nThe results of this Iranian attack on Israel when compared to the Russian\nattacks on Ukraine are very useful to help us understand a few things. First\nis the severe handicaps under which the Ukrainians are having to fight, second\nthat we are still over-estimating Russia\u2019s capabilities as a great power (its\nnot) and third that the US is reinforcing a policy that will lead to the\nworld-wide spread of nuclear weapons.\n\nOverall, it shows that Ukraine is being made to suffer because its not a\nnuclear power.\n\nFirst. The intercept rates of Iranian systems were very high\u2014but actually not\nunexpected under the conditions. It seems that 99% of the Iranian UAVs (300 or\nso fired) and Cruise missiles (30+ fired) were intercepted\u2014for almost total\nprotection from these systems. Even the ballistic missiles seem to have been\nintercepted at a rate well over 90%. 110+ were launched and about 7 may have\nhit their targets (or at least hit something in Israel).\n\nWhy is this\u2014well because in this case Israel (with strong US aid) could start\nthe intercept process, including with fixed wing aircraft, hundreds of miles\nbefore the Iranian systems reached Israel. They were able to proactively go\nand get the attacking systems with F-35s for instance (each of which might\nhave the capability to shoot down 16 Shaheds). This meant that only a small\npercentage of the attacking systems, mostly the ballistic missiles, would have\ngotten anywhere close to the Israeli border.\n\nUkraine, in comparison, has to sit back and can only defend itself from much\ncloser range and without all the options that Israel and the US have. Its a\ncompletely different and much more disadvantageous war that Ukraine has to\nfight (and the US wants it to be even more disadvantageous as it gets all bent\nout of shape if the Ukrainians even consider attacks over Russian soil). It\nalso shows that great intellectual poverty of the US trying to delay the\ndelivery of F-16s for so long. They could at least play a role strengthening\nUkrainian defensive capabilities\u2014even though they are far less sophisticated\nthan what the Israelis and US used last night.\n\nSecond. The Iranian attack against a power that can actually defend itself\nefficiently should help put into perspective Russian power. Lately we have\nbeen hearing again about how powerful and adaptive Russia is\u2014in a way that\nstill over-rates what we are seeing. The issue determining the outcome of the\nRussian raids on Ukraine is more Ukrainian limitations than anything else.\nUkraine has old and insufficient systems and is running out of ammunition. And\nRussia can launch attacks against Ukraine with almost no fear of disruption.\nIt reinforces the message that Russia can be defeated if Ukraine is armed\nproperly.\n\nThird. One of the biggest differences last night is that Israel, which has far\nmore capable air defenses than Ukraine, was supported by the USA, UK, and\nFrance in its efforts to shoot down Iranian systems. This is extraordinary and\nworthy of note. Why are they doing this? The US has been far more critical of\nIsrael than Ukraine. The Ukrainians need the help more than Israel\u2014and yet the\nUS helps Israel more than Ukraine.\n\nThe answer seems to be that the US is desperate to in its minds limit the\nchance of Israeli escalation and is not really that bothered about Ukraine\nhaving the ability to escalate. Well, the big difference in escalation\nconcerns is that Israel is a nuclear power and Ukraine is not.\n\nConclusion\n\nSo what the US is seeming to say is that if you are a nuclear power\u2014we will\nhelp you to try and make sure you are safe. However, if you are not a nuclear\npower\u2014tough luck and go deal with it. Its the flip side of the coin about how\nthe US is dealing with Russia. In this case\u2014if our friends (Ukraine) want to\nfight a nuclear power, the US will restrain them as much as possible by\nlimiting what they get and what they can do.\n\nIt might sound clever\u2014but in a meta-sense its about as extreme a pro-\nescalation policy as the US could devise. The US is saying that if you are a\nnuclear power, you will be either protected actively (Israel) or by restraint\n(Russia) but if you are a non-nuclear power you will be expected to fight with\none hand tied behind your back.\n\nWhat should every country in the world take from this? Well, the logical\nanswer is that the only way to really protect yourself is with nuclear\nweapons. When you add this to the clear unreliability of the US as a friend\nand ally these days, what the US is doing is setting the stage for a spread of\nnuclear weapons development. There seem to be no drawbacks and only benefits\nto having nuclear weapons\u2014so why not develop them if you can?\n\nBtw, Europe really needs to think about this and start acting soon. Europe is\nactually very poorly defended by nuclear weapons if the USA goes home\u2014reliant\non the very small UK and French deterrents. As a first order, Europe will have\nto have a serious discussion about how its nuclear capabilities are going to\nbe strengthened. The alternative will be dictation by larger nuclear powers.\nMore about this in the coming week.\n\nShare\n\nIs an Aid Vote in the House Getting Closer?\n\nI really am going to hate writing this section\u2014because its more hopeful than I\nwould like to be by nature. What I am going to say in it comes from a number\nof sources in the US who have decent connections either in the House or in the\nRepublican Party. I cant say who are what they are, and I cant know for sure\nwhat they are telling me is right (except to say that they have often been\nright in the past). So take what I am telling you with a big grain of salt\u2014but\nat least the news is better now than earlier.\n\nIt seems the odds of a floor vote in the House of Representatives on aid for\nUkraine have risen significantly over the last week. Indeed, a number of\npeople are saying that the vote could happen this week (or early the week\nafter). There are still some real unknowns (will the vote be on the Senate\nbill, or a House bill that makes aid come in the form of loans?) but it seems\nthat there might actually be a vote.\n\nThere are a few reasons for the increased chance of a vote. First, once again\nthe only way the House can function, as the FISA surveillance bill shows, is\nwith large numbers of members of both parties acting together. In this case,\nit was withe 126 Republicans and 147 Democrats. Speaker Johnson knows that no\nRepublican-only bill can ever pass the House.\n\nAlso, the political calculus is turning in favor of helping Ukraine in its\nhour of great need. The picture of the present, which sees the US cutting off\naid to Ukraine while the Russians pummel Ukrainian infrastructure\u2014is actually\nnot good, even for many Republicans. The arguments that they are being Putin\u2019s\nlackeys is one the Republicans are worried about. And they are suffering in a\nfew other areas politically\u2014such as on abortion rights. It was a really bad\nweek for the Republicans politically on abortion (see the Arizona Supreme\nCourt Ruling). With their narrative suffering, they seem to be loosening up on\nUkraine.\n\nAlso, the need to unblock aid for Israel, which is a major priority for parts\nof the Republican Party, seems to be leading to an acceptance of a vote on aid\nwhich takes in Ukraine as well. The Senate has combined aid for both in one\nbill, and as such the best way to get aid for Israel might also be to approve\naid for Ukraine.\n\nFinally, Trump seems to understand that the political mood music wont be\nhelped by Ukraine being publicly martyred. However in Trump\u2019s case, the key\nthing seems to be to make him believe he is in charge of things. Thus during\nJohnson\u2019s visit to Mar a Lago this week, Trump made the public statement that\nhe could consider loans for Ukraine. From Republican sources who know, this\nreally is a good sign. Trump doesnt want aid for Ukraine, but if it can be\nmade to look like he is the one in charge, he might not publicly oppose it.\n\nSpeaker Johnson during his visit with Trump this week:\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/video/house-speaker-mike-johnson-visits-trump-at-mar-\na-lago/\n\nThis however, also reveals a problem. If Ukraine aid is to be classified as a\nloan, then that will require changes to the Senate Bill\u2014and a return vote in\nthe Senate. That is not an impossible hurdle, but it will require more work.\nThe good news is that the loan requirement is basically a fig leaf. The loans\ncan be forgiven later, or even paid with with the interest from seized Russian\nassets.\n\nSo, the mood music has changed. Crucially, it looks like for political\nreasons, Trump might not stop the aid any more (he has been the real problem\nfor now).\n\nAll I can say, is I really hope these people are right. Ukraine has been made\nto suffer not only because it is not a nuclear power, but because Trump has\nbeen actively sabotaging aid to it. This has allowed Russia months to attack a\ndecreasing Ukrainian defense\u2014with some pretty disastrous results for Ukraine.\nIt needs to end now.\n\nHave a good rest of the weekend.\n\nShare\n\n152 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n13 Restacks\n\n152\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Weekend Update #76: A Tale of Two Raids: Ukraine Has No Nuclear Weapons\nSo Must Suffer\n\nphillipspobrien.substack.com\n\n67\n\nShare\n\n67 Comments\n\nAndrew Pavelyev15 hrs ago\u00b7edited 14 hrs agoLiked by Phillips P. OBrienThere\nare huge technical differences between Ukrainian and Israeli situations. Even\nif Ukraine were as supported as Israel, a similar aerial assault on Ukraine\nwould still be devastating. I can think of at least several reasons. To begin\nwith, some Russian missiles seem to be more advanced (and harder to intercept)\nthat the Iranian ones. Then Iran is far from Israel, so there was ample\nwarning (in fact it took the drones several hours to approach Israel). The\nrange of directions of approach was also limited, as almost all projectiles\noriginated to the east from Israel (except for some from Yemen). OTOH Russia\ncan launch from Belarussian airspace, Crimea and everywhere in between. US\nnaval assets are located in the Mediterranean and Red Seas and in the Persian\nGulf, and presumably there are AWACS planes flying around. So Iranian launches\nwere quickly detected, and some projectiles could be shot down by US ships.\nWhen the Russians launch missiles from e.g. the Caspian Sea, they may not even\nbe detected soon (let alone shot down), as there can be no US (or other\nfriendly) naval or air assets within hundreds of miles. Israeli fighters could\nventure hundreds of miles outside Israel for interceptions because it was\nperfectly safe for them to fly over Jordan (in fact the local air force joined\nthem in their efforts and shot down dozens of drones). But even if Ukraine had\na lot of F-16s, they would not dare to try any interceptions in Russian air\nspace. They would not even risk flying over Kharkiv. Finally, Israel is much\nsmaller than Ukraine, so it needs fewer systems to cover all important areas.\nHalf of Israeli population lives in the area that is at most twice bigger than\nthe area within Kyiv city limits. And Kyiv is well protected.Expand full\ncommentLike (29)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n19 replies by Phillips P. OBrien and others\n\nMichael Wild16 hrs agoLiked by Phillips P.
