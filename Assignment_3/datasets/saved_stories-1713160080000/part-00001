You want your base to either be a power of 2 so that you can\nkeep dividing by two (like a gallon has 128 fluid ounces) or have a bunch of\nuseful factors (like a foot has 12 inches, so you can easily get 1\u20443 or 1\u20444;\nand a minute has 60 seconds). Base 10\u2019s factors are not great; you rarely want\nto divide anything by 5.\n\nSome alien race has eight fingers, and when they visit here they understand\nwhy we use base 10, but it must be striking to them how bad of a base it is.\nLike you have 100 grams and you can divide it by 2 twice and after that you\ncan only divide it by 5. Who needs to divide by 5? Especially in cooking.\n\nIt\u2019d be like if we found an alien species that used base 14 for everything.\nOne unit, then 14, then 196?! If you have 196 grams, you can divide it by 2\ntwice and then you can only divide it by 7? Bad base! Use 12 or 8 or\nsomething.\n\nMetric\u2019s entire foundation is a bad base.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
