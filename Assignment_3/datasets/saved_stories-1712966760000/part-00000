With this latest expansion to our repair\nprogram, we\u2019re excited to be adding even more choice and convenience for our\ncustomers, while helping to extend the life of our products and their parts.\u201d\n\nThe process of confirming whether or not a repair part is genuine and\ngathering information about the part \u2014 often referred to as \u201cpairing\u201d \u2014 is\ncritical to preserving the privacy, security, and safety of iPhone. Apple\nteams have been hard at work over the last two years to enable the reuse of\nparts such as biometric sensors used for Face ID or Touch ID, and beginning\nthis fall, calibration for genuine Apple parts, new or used, will happen on\ndevice after the part is installed. In addition, future iPhone releases will\nhave support for used biometric sensors. And in order to simplify the repair\nprocess, customers and service providers will no longer need to provide a\ndevice\u2019s serial number when ordering parts from the Self Service Repair Store\nfor repairs not involving replacement of the logic board.\n\nApple will also extend its popular Activation Lock feature to iPhone parts in\norder to deter stolen iPhones from being disassembled for parts. Requested by\ncustomers and law enforcement officials, the feature was designed to limit\niPhone theft by blocking a lost or stolen iPhone from being reactivated. If a\ndevice under repair detects that a supported part was obtained from another\ndevice with Activation Lock or Lost Mode enabled, calibration capabilities for\nthat part will be restricted.\n\nAs device longevity increases, Apple believes it\u2019s important that a device\u2019s\nsecond or third owners have access to its full part and repair histories. With\nParts and Service history, located within Settings on iOS, Apple is the only\nsmartphone company that transparently shows owners whether their device has\nbeen repaired and provides information about the parts used. This fall, Apple\nwill expand Parts and Service History to additionally show whether a part is a\nnew or used genuine Apple part.\n\nThis upcoming enhancement to Apple\u2019s repair processes is another step forward\nin the company\u2019s commitment to improving access to safe and affordable\nrepairs. In the last five years, Apple has nearly doubled the number of\nservice locations with access to genuine Apple parts, tools, and training to\nmore than 10,000 Independent Repair Providers and Apple Authorized Service\nProviders. For those who have the relevant experience repairing electronic\ndevices, Self Service Repair gives access to the manuals, genuine Apple parts,\nand tools used at Apple Store and Apple Authorized Service Provider locations.\nLaunched in 2022, Self Service Repair now supports 40 Apple products in 33\ncountries and regions, and 24 languages.\n\nShare article\n\n## Media\n\n  * Text of this article\n\nApril 11, 2024\n\nUPDATE\n\nApple to expand repair options with support for used genuine parts\n\nNew parts calibration process will begin this fall; Activation Lock to limit\nuse of parts from lost or stolen devices\n\nToday Apple announced an upcoming enhancement to existing repair processes\nthat will enable customers and independent repair providers to utilize used\nApple parts in repairs.
