Therefore, automated\n> theorem proving of Olympiad-level geometry problems is considered a notable\n> milestone in human-level automated reasoning. The introduction of\n> AlphaGeometry, a neuro-symbolic model trained with 100 million synthetic\n> samples, marked a major breakthrough. It solved 25 of 30 International\n> Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) problems whereas the reported baseline based on\n> Wu's method solved only ten. In this note, we revisit the IMO-AG-30\n> Challenge introduced with AlphaGeometry, and find that Wu's method is\n> surprisingly strong. Wu's method alone can solve 15 problems, and some of\n> them are not solved by any of the other methods. This leads to two key\n> findings: (i) Combining Wu's method with the classic synthetic methods of\n> deductive databases and angle, ratio, and distance chasing solves 21 out of\n> 30 methods by just using a CPU-only laptop with a time limit of 5 minutes\n> per problem. Essentially, this classic method solves just 4 problems less\n> than AlphaGeometry and establishes the first fully symbolic baseline strong\n> enough to rival the performance of an IMO silver medalist. (ii) Wu's method\n> even solves 2 of the 5 problems that AlphaGeometry failed to solve. Thus, by\n> combining AlphaGeometry with Wu's method we set a new state-of-the-art for\n> automated theorem proving on IMO-AG-30, solving 27 out of 30 problems, the\n> first AI method which outperforms an IMO gold medalist.\n\nComments:| Work in Progress.
