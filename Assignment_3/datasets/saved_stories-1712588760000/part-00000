In all\nlikelihood, no, but that hasn\u2019t stopped people from speculating that it does.\n\nThe New Testament is peppered with references to Jesus\u2019 \u201csecond coming,\u201d the\ntime when Christians believe Jesus will return to Earth, the wicked will be\njudged, and the righteous rewarded.\n\nThe Apostle Paul writes about it in his letters, and the Gospels portray Jesus\nspeaking about it.\n\nThe upcoming solar eclipse on April 8, 2024, which will be visible over parts\nof North America, has brought with it a slew of predictions that Jesus might\nbe returning sooner rather than later.\n\nI am a scholar of early Christian literature whose research focuses on how\npeople read, understand and sometimes misunderstand biblical texts.\n\nReligious theories surrounding this eclipse are part of a larger pattern of\nattempts to find meaning in astronomical events that goes back thousands of\nyears.\n\n## Finding meaning in the skies\n\nOne of the more famous examples from the ancient world of people finding\nmeaning in the skies occurred in 44 B.C.E., when a comet appeared in the skies\nover Italy just four short months after the assassination of Julius Caesar.\nRoman authors Pliny the Elder and Suetonius claimed that the comet was visible\nfor about a week and that it was so bright, it could be spotted in the late\nafternoon.\n\nMany Romans interpreted its appearance and lingering presence as a sign that\nCaesar had ascended to the heavens and had taken a seat among the many gods of\nRome. Caesar\u2019s deification was made official by a vote of the Roman senate\nless than two years later.\n\nA few examples from the past 30 years further illustrate this phenomenon. In\nDecember 2020, speculation ran wild in some Christian circles that a planetary\nconjunction of Jupiter and Saturn signaled the return of the fabled \u201cStar of\nBethlehem\u201d that led the wise men to the newborn Jesus.\n\nFor at least 10 years, televangelist John Hagee has promoted theories linking\nvarious \u201cblood moons\u201d as signs that the apocalypse is approaching.\n\nA tragic example is the religious movement known as Heaven\u2019s Gate. Members of\nthis movement believed that there was a spacecraft hidden in the tail of the\nHale-Bopp Comet, which appeared in 1997. This spacecraft, they thought, was\ncoming to transport them to a higher level of consciousness. In March 1997, 39\nmembers of the Heaven\u2019s Gate movement committed ritualized, mass suicide\nthrough a lethal combination of phenobarbital, vodka and asphyxiation.\n\n## Chasing shadows\n\nIt can be difficult to pinpoint exactly where such interpretations of\ncelestial events originate.\n\nIn the case of the upcoming eclipse, one of the images that has fueled\npredictions of Jesus\u2019 second coming simply notes southern Illinois as the\nlocation where the upcoming eclipse will overlap the path of the last North\nAmerican solar eclipse in 2017.\n\nA map showing the path of total solar eclipses in 2017 and 2024. Eclipse maps\npublished by Michael Zeiler, CC BY-NC\n\nFrom this image, two theories have emerged: First, that these eclipses are\nseparated by roughly seven years, which has symbolic significance in biblical\nliterature as a number indicating completeness and perfection. Second, on\ncharting the paths of these eclipses on a map, they appear to form a cross.\n\nSome Christians have taken this as evidence that the upcoming eclipse is an\nindication that Jesus\u2019 return is imminent.\n\nBut there is no logical basis for this theory.\n\nFor starters, solar eclipses are not quite as rare as they seem. A solar\neclipse occurs when the moon passes between the Earth and the Sun and blots\nout all or some of the Sun\u2019s light. They seem rare because they affect only\nthe narrow strip of land that falls in the shadow of the Moon.\n\nAccording to NASA, there has been an average of 2.5 eclipses per year over the\npast 1,000 years.\n\nThe phenomenon of two eclipses crossing paths is also rather unremarkable.\nLooking at a map of eclipse paths between 2001 and 2025, it is clear that\neclipses frequently cross paths; of the 15 solar eclipses during this span of\ntime, only two did not cross paths.\n\nMap of the world charting the paths of eclipses between 2001 and 2025. All but\ntwo of these paths intersect.

But this isn\u2019t logical in terms\nof the larger argument that some are making. These eclipses \u2013 on August 21,\n2017, and April 8, 2024 \u2013 are separated not by seven years but by six and a\nhalf years, or 2,422 days to be exact. Another pair of eclipses that crossed\npaths in the Pacific Ocean \u2013 on July 22, 2009, and March 9, 2016 \u2013 were\nseparated by the same number of days.\n\n## Seek and you will find\n\nMost of these end times predictions are rooted in North American evangelical\nviews on the apocalypse, many of which originated or at least share an\naffinity with evangelical author Hal Lindsey\u2019s popular book, \u201cThe Late Great\nPlanet Earth.\u201d\n\nIn this book, Lindsey predicted that the apocalypse would occur in the 1980s,\nand to make his argument, he stitched together a number of disparate events\nand phenomena to construct an apocalyptic narrative that included Soviet\nhelicopters, the establishment of the state of Israel and nuclear warfare.\n\nLindsey was wrong, of course; the 1980s did not bring about the apocalypse.\nBut this way of thinking \u2013 of seeking to find significance in various random\nevents like eclipses \u2013 persists among some Christians.\n\nThe difference between this pairing of the 2017 and 2024 eclipses and the ones\nfrom 2009 and 2016 is simple: The most recent pairing crosses over the United\nStates. Patterns emerge when and where they are sought, and much depends on\nthe aims of the people doing the seeking.\n\nThe second coming of Jesus is undeniably a topic of conversation among New\nTestament authors. But it is interesting to note that there is little\nagreement among these authors when it comes to timing. What is presented in\nthe Gospels is different from what is presented in the letters of Paul. And\nboth of these are quite different from what is found in the book of\nRevelation.\n\nBut these authors do share a sense that the timing of \u201cthe end\u201d is ultimately\nmysterious and unknowable. And this would suggest that attempting to predict\nsuch timing by means of things like eclipses is, at the very least, not\nterribly \u201cbiblical.\u201d\n\n  * Apocalypse\n  * Comets\n  * Julius Caesar\n  * Evangelicals\n  * Apostle Paul\n  * New Testament\n  * Religion and society\n\n### Events\n\nMore events\n\n### Jobs\n\n  * ##### Project Officer, Student Volunteer Program\n\n  * ##### Audience Development Coordinator (fixed-term maternity cover)\n\n  * ##### Lecturer (Hindi-Urdu)\n\n  * ##### Director, Defence and Security\n\n  * ##### Opportunities with the new CIEHF\n\nMore jobs\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2010\u20132024, The Conversation Media Group Ltd\n\n", "frontpage": false}
