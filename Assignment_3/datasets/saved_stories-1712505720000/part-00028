KB5035941 introduced new lock screen widgets, Windows Spotlight for\ndesktop backgrounds, and many other non-security fixes and improvements. The\nupdate also resolved a long-standing bug with the System Preparation Tool,\nwhich was causing a 0x80073cf2 error.\n\nThe System Preparation Tool is a special utility IT admins can use for\ninstallation generalization. In other words, the app can remove information\nspecific to a particular system so the image can be later used on other\ncomputers. Audit mode in the System Preparation Tool allows admins to apply\nadditional changes, install drivers and applications, and more.\n\nIn January 2023, Microsoft confirmed that KB5032278 (November 2023 non-\nsecurity update) and subsequent updates can cause problems with completing a\nsystem preparation using sysprep.exe due to issues with a Microsoft Edge\npackage. Affected systems were showing a 0x80073cf error in the setupact.log\nand the following error message:\n\n> Sysprep was not able to validate your Windows installation. Review the log\n> file at %WINDIR%\\system32\\Sysprep\\Panther\\setupact.log for details. After\n> resolving the issue, use Sysprep to validate your installation again.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft has a dedicated support page that describes how to check if your\ncomputers were affected by the sysprep.exe issue. Now, with the release of\nKB5035941, IT admins can fix the problem for good.\n\nAccording to the official Windows Health Dashboard page, the System\nPreparation Tool bug and its 0x80073cf2 error only affect systems with client\nversions of Windows 10 22H2. Windows 11 is not affected. Also, like the\nrecently confirmed problem with Microsoft Connected Cache in KB5034203,\nsysprep.exe issues are only relevant for enterprise consumers, so there is\nnothing to worry about if you have a regular home device.\n\nYou can find more information about the System Preparation Tool and its Audit\nmode from the official support articles on the Microsoft Learn website.\n\n#### Tags\n\n  * Microsoft\n  * Windows 10\n  * Kb5032278\n  * Kb5035941\n  * Windows bugs\n  * Known issues\n  * Sysprep\n\nLike\n\nPost\n\nShare\n\nReport a problem with article\n\nNext Article\n\n### 12-core AMD Ryzen 9 5900X drops to its lowest price ever\n\nPrevious Article\n\n### Weekend PC Game Deals: Worlds to claim, bundles to choose, and more\n\n### Related Stories\n\n### Microsoft confirms caching issues in Windows 10 KB5034203 and newer\nupdates\n\nTaras Buria \u00b7 Apr 5, 2024 with 4 comment s\n\n### Microsoft: We are working on KB5034441/KB5034440 \"0x80070643 -\nERROR_INSTALL_FAILURE\" fix\n\nSayan Sen \u00b7 Jan 15, 2024 with 19 comment s\n\n### Microsoft confirms weird printing issues and uncalled HP Smart App\ninstallations on Windows\n\nTaras Buria \u00b7 Dec 5, 2023 with 8 comment s\n\n### As Microsoft also pushes it to Windows 10, buggy Copilot puts the brakes\non Windows 11 23H2\n\nSayan Sen \u00b7 Dec 1, 2023 with 11 comment s\n\nFrom the WebPowered by ZergNet\n\nWe Never Expected The American Chopper Guys To End Up Here\n\nThese Twitch Streamers Are Stunning Without Makeup\n\nNever, Ever Kill A Spider In Your House.
