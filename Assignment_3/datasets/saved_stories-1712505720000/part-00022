Free 30-day trial\n\nThe impact that AI has on society has steadily crept into the darkest nooks\nand crannies of the internet. So much so that cybercrooks are hitching free\nrides on the AI bandwagon by leveraging the increased demand of AI-powered\nsoftware for content creators.\n\nCybercriminal groups constantly adapt their operating methods and tools to\nstay a step ahead of potential victims. Highly focused on enhancing their\ndeceptive practices, threat actors have, unfortunately, found a most reliable\nand powerful ally in artificial intelligence.\n\nBitdefender researchers are keeping a close eye on these deceptive efforts and\nexploits regarding the rising popularity of generative artificial intelligence\nsoftware to keep consumers aware and help protect their devices, data and\nmoney.\n\nOver the past year, Bitdefender Labs has seen a motley crew of AI-powered\nillicit operations conducted by threat actors over social media, from stream-\njacking attacks that delivered crypto-doubling schemes on YouTube to audio\ndeep fakes that overflow on Meta\u2019s social platforms.\n\nThis paper focuses on nefarious activities that take advantage of the demand\nand supply of some of the most popular generative AI software to attack users\nfrom across the globe.\n\n### Key findings:\n\n  * Cybercrooks have taken over Facebook profiles to run sponsored malvertising campaigns impersonating Midjourney, Sora AI, DALL-E 3, Evoto, ChatGPT 5 and many others\n  * The malicious pages on Facebook are meticulously designed to trick users into downloading purportedly official desktop versions of popular AI software. The cybercriminals behind these campaigns regularly change and adapt the malicious payloads in an attempt to avoid further detection from security software\n  * The links direct users to malicious webpages that download a variety of intrusive stealers to harvest sensitive information from compromised systems, including credentials, autocomplete data, credit card information, and even crypto wallet information.\n  * The analyzed campaigns employ malicious ads that contain links to executable files that serve Rilide, Vidar, IceRAT, Nova Stealers. The entire batch of malicious software is often offered as malware-as-a-service by threat actors on specialized forums and channels.\n  * The malvertising campaigns have tremendous reach through Meta\u2019s sponsored ad system and have actively been targeting European users from Germany, Poland, Italy, France, Belgium, Spain, the Netherlands, Romania, Sweden, and elsewhere.\n  * The ads use convincing descriptions alongside generated AI videos and photos to lure potential users into accessing malicious payloads\n  * One particular Facebook page impersonating Midjourney with a whopping 1.2 million followers was active for nearly a year until it was shut down on March 8, 2024. Since then threat actors have continuously set up more fraudulent pages to deliver malicious ads to users.\n  * The Midjourney malvertising ad campaign was directed towards male Facebook users aged 25 to 55 and had an ad reach of approximately 500,000 individuals from Europe (demographics and reach of the campaign were obtained by tracking Meta\u2019s Ad Library catalog)\n\n### Organizing the attacks\n\nThreat actors are actively spreading malware through Meta\u2019s sponsored ad\nsystem.\n\nThe malicious campaigns begin with cybercriminals taking over an existing\nFacebook account. Once compromised, the crooks begin to change descriptions\nand cover and profile photos, making the page seem as if it is run by well-\nknown AI-based image and video generators.\n\nThe cybercriminals then begin boosting the legitimacy of the page with news,\nAI-generated photos and advertisements that contain descriptions of\nenhancements of the impersonated AI service and links that give users free\naccess or trials for the tool.\n\nThe point of the malicious campaign is to trick individuals into accessing a\nmalicious link and downloading malware onto devices.\n\nAlthough many of the malicious ads inspected by Bitdefender researchers urged\nindividuals to download the purported new version of the AI tool from Dropbox\nand Google Drive links \u2013 which is undoubtedly a huge red flag \u2013 the campaign\nimpersonating Midjourney used a different approach.\n\nCybercriminals created over a dozen malicious websites mimicking the official\nMidjourney landing page to lure users into downloading the latest version of\nthe service via a GoFile link.\n\n### Threat actors serve a four-course menu of info stealers\n\nCybercriminals have created a highly engaging distribution system for\nmalicious software through the Malware-as-a-service (MaaS) business model that\nenables any malicious individual to conduct sophisticated and cost-efficient\nattacks and other nefarious activities.\n\nThis includes stealing sensitive information, compromising online accounts,\ncommitting fraud, disrupting operations, or demanding ransom after encrypting\ndata on a compromised system.\n\nThe malvertising campaigns analyzed by our researchers have been distributing\nan assortment of malicious software that poses severe risks to consumers\u2019\ndevices, data and identity. Users who\u2019ve interacted with the malware-serving\nads could have unknowingly downloaded and deployed harmful files onto their\ndevices: Rilide Stealer, Vidar Stealer, IceRAT (written in JPHP) and Nova\nStealer.\n\n### Rilide Stealer V4\n\nResearchers at Bitdefender Labs have spotted an updated version of the Rilide\nStealer (V4) in various sponsored ad campaigns impersonating AI-based software\nor photo editors including Sora, CapCut, Gemini AI, Photo Effects Pro and\nCapCut Pro.\n\nThe malware known as Rilide is a malicious extension that targets Chromium-\nbased browsers, including Google Chrome, Opera, Brave and Microsoft Edge, and\nenables threat actors to monitor browsing history, capture login credentials,\nand even withdraw crypto funds by bypassing 2FA through script injections.\n\nWhat\u2019s new for Rilide V4:\n\n  * The malicious extension mainly targets Facebook cookies\n  * It masquerades as a Google Translate Extension\n  * The threat actor uses better obfuscation techniques to hide the true intent of the software. The so-called app installer for the AI software immediately opens the official webpage of the impersonated AI image generator to fool users. At the same time, it begins loading the malicious extension onto the victim\u2019s browsers.\n\nIndicators of compromise\n\nMalicious hashes\n\n  * 2d6829e8a2f48fff5348244ce0eaa35bcd4b26eac0f36063b9ff888e664310db - OpenAI Sora official version setup.msi - Sora\n  * a7c07d2c8893c30d766f383be0dd78bc6a5fd578efaea4afc3229cd0610ab0cf - OpenAI Sora Setup.zip - Sora\n  * e394f4192c2a3e01e6c1165ed1a483603b411fd12d417bfb0dc72bd6e18e9e9d - Setup.msi - Sora\n  * 021657f82c94511e97771739e550d63600c4d76cef79a686aa44cdca668814e0 - Setup.msi - Sora\n  * 92751fd15f4d0b495e2b83d14461d22d6b74beaf51d73d9ae2b86e2232894d7b - Setup.msi \u2013 Sora\n  * 32a097b510ae830626209206c815bbbed1c36c0d2df7a9d8252909c604a9c1f1 - Setup.msi - Sora\n  * c665ff2206c9d4e50861f493f8e7beca8353b37671d633fe4b6e084c62e58ed9 - Setup.msi - Sora\n  * 0ed3b92fda104ac62cc3dc0a5ed0f400c6958d7034e3855cad5474fca253125e - Capcut Pro For PC.setup.msi - Capcut\n  * 757855fcd47f843739b9a330f1ecb28d339be41eed4ae25220dc888e57f2ec51 - OpenAI ChatGPT-4.5 Version Free.msi - ChatGPT\n  * 3686204361bf6bf8db68fd81e08c91abcbf215844f0119a458c319e92a396ecf - Google Gemini AI Ultra Version Updata.msi - Gemini AI\n  * d60ea266c4e0f0e8d56d98472a91dd5c37e8eeeca13bf53e0381f0affc68e78a - Photo Effects Pro v3.1.3 Setup.msi - Photo Effects\n  * bb7c3b78f2784a7ac3c090331326279476c748087188aeb69f431bbd70ac6407 - Photo Effects Pro v3.1.3 Setup.msi - Photo Effects\n  * 0ed3b92fda104ac62cc3dc0a5ed0f400c6958d7034e3855cad5474fca253125e - AISora.setup.msi - Sora\n\n### Analysis of OpenAI Sora official version setup.rar \u2013 Rilide V4 sample\n\nThe malicious application that poses as AI-related software (although it mixes\ndifferent LLMs, such as OpenAI, Sora, or Gemini, throughout its files)\ninstalls a browser extension that steals credentials, tokens, and cookies from\nFacebook accounts.\n\n  * Contains a MS Installer (.msi): \"OpenAI Sora official version setup.msi\"\n  * It tries to install to C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Install (regardless of whether Google software has been previously installed)\n\nFolder contents:\n\nNew Folder #%d1\n\n  * 88kus.xlsx\n  * Gemini.png\n\nNew Folder #%d2\n\n  * account_manager (20).xls\n  * account_manager (21).xls\n  * account_manager (22).xls\n  * list_page (3).xlsx\n\nnmmhkkegccagdldgiimedpic\n\n  * background.js\n  * content.js\n  * favicon.png\n  * manifest.json\n  * ru.ps1\n\ninstall.cmd logo.ico\n\nMicrosoft.VisualC.Dll\n\nOpenAI Sora official version setup.msi\n\nSystem.Deployment.dll\n\nSystem.Web.DynamicData.Design.dll\n\n### nmmhkkegccagdldgiimedpic - a browser extension\n\nmanifest.json:\n\ncontent.js:\n\nbackground.js: The file is too large and obfuscated to include it here.

Some are free, some offer free trials, and\nothers run on a subscription plan. Enter Midjourney, one of the most prominent\ngenerative AI tools that lets users craft images from text inputs.\n\nWith a growing user base of over 16 million as of Nov. 2023, Midjourney has\nbeen a fan-favorite among cybercriminal gangs as well over the past year.\n\nSince at least June 2023, cybercriminals have conducted massive ad campaigns\nimpersonating the AI-powered art generator to serve malware to unsuspecting\nusers.\n\nJust a single Facebook page using the name Mid-Journey AI with a following of\n1.2 million had an ad reach of over 500,000 individuals in Europe before being\ntaken down on March 8, 2024.\n\nNote: It\u2019s unclear if Meta took down the impostor page following multiple\nreports by victims or official Midjourney developers.\n\nThe malicious page with 1.2 million followers appears to have been taken over\non June 28, 2023, when the attackers changed the original name of the\ncompromised Facebook profile page. The individuals managing the page were\nspread worldwide, according to information from our researcher\u2019s analysis.\n\nBefore the demise of the impostor Midjourney page on Facebook, Bitdefender\nLabs had a chance to carefully inspect and catalog the malicious advertisement\ncampaigns running through it.\n\nAt first glance, it appears that the cybercriminals behind the campaign\ninvested time and resources to boost the popularity and reach of the malicious\npage, posting highly engaging content expanded by hundreds of likes and user\ncomments. Again, we can\u2019t confirm whether all of the AI-generated images\nshowcased in their ads were stolen from different content creators and other\nofficial websites.\n\nThe threat actors went above and beyond to tailor their ads, showcasing their\ncreative side with custom ads for France, Germany, and Spain that featured AI-\nreimagined images of national mascots.\n\nOther ads attempt to lure users interested in the NFT marketplace with a\nchance to create NFT art and even monetize their generated images after\nminting their artwork through a blockchain.\n\nAlthough the imposter page boasting over 1.2 million followers was recently\nshut down, our research has shown that cybercriminals acted quickly to set up\na new page impersonating Midjourney between March 8-9, 2024. The page was also\nset up after taking over another user\u2019s Facebook account, who also commented\nin the review section of the page warning other users that the account was\nhacked. Since we began our investigation, we noticed an additional four\nFacebook pages attempting to impersonate Midjourney, some of which were also\nremoved from the platform.\n\nThe latest malicious page impersonating Midjourney appears to have been taken\nover by the attackers on March 18 when the cybercriminals changed the original\nname of the original Facebook page. As of March 26, the scam profile has\n637,000 followers (as seen below).\n\nMidJourney Fake Website\n\nIndicators of compromise\n\n  * 159.89.120.191\n  * 159.89.98.241\n\nMalicious Domains\n\n  * https://aimidjourney[.]agency/\n  * https://aimidjourney[.]org/\n  * https://getmidjourney[.]tech/\n  * https://aimidjourney[.]online/\n  * https://midjourneys[.]world/\n  * https://mid-journey[.]pro/\n  * https://deepface[.]pro/\n  * https://ai-midjourneys[.]org/\n  * https://aimidjourneys[.]com/\n  * https://ai-midjourney[.]pro/\n  * https://aimidjourney[.]tech/\n  * https://get-midjourney[.]site/\n  * https://midjourneys[.]online/\n  * https://midjourneys[.]site/\n  * https://ai-midjourney[.]net/\n  * https://midjourneys[.]co/\n  * https://aimidjourneys[.]org/\n  * https://mid-journey[.]life/\n  * https://midjourneys[.]live/\n  * https://midjourneysai[.]us/\n  * https://midjourneys[.]tech/\n  * https://midjourneyais[.]us/\n  * https://mid-journey[.]tech/\n  * https://ai-midjourney[.]info/\n  * https://art-midjourney[.]art/\n  * https://art-midjourney[.]org/\n  * https://ai-midjourneys[.]com/\n  * https://ai-midjourneys[.]net/\n  * https://aimidjourney[.]space/\n\n### More malicious pages and ads\n\n### Info Stealer activity and best practices to avoid compromise\n\nInfo-stealer activity has risen sharply over the past couple of years, with\ncybercrooks propagating stealer attacks through email spam, legitimate-looking\napps, Google search advertising and other schemes over social media.\n\nThe success of malicious data stealers that exfiltrate sensitive information\nfrom web browsers, emails, messaging apps, and even crypto wallets works\nseemingly on a malware-as-a-service model, allowing even the most low-level\ncybercrook to conduct elaborate attacks.\n\n### How to prevent Info-Stealer infections\n\n  * Use a trustworthy security solution. Bitdefender\u2019s industry and award-leading protection against e-threats of all kinds, from viruses to Trojans and all the way to ransomware, prevents even the most evasive malware intrusion from damaging your device and data.\n  * Employ a layered security approach. A comprehensive security solution with multi-layered protection features not only detects malware but prevents you from landing on a malicious webpage, stopping any intrusive download that can impact your security and privacy.\n  * Keep software and operating systems up to date. Skipping updates and patches can significantly impact your device and online security. Use Bitdefender security solutions to conduct a full vulnerability assessment on your Windows device. With just one click, you can immediately check for outdated and vulnerable software, missing security patches, or unsafe system settings that you immediately fix.\n  * Stick to good cyber hygiene and don\u2019t click on suspicious links, pop-ups or download software from unsafe or unknown sources.\n  * Only download applications from official stores and websites\n  * Enable two-factor authentication to avoid malicious actors from gaining access to your online accounts to steal your data and money\n  * Have a chat with Scamio, our AI-powered scam detector online or via Facebook Messenger. You only need to describe the details of a potential scam, send suspicious links, or upload screenshots and QR codes to receive recommendations and thwart potential security threats.\n\nAn up-to-date, complete list of indicators of compromise is available to\nBitdefender Advanced Threat Intelligence users.
