It\u2019s just damn slow, painful and sometimes borderline broken.\n\nRegardless, I have performed this feat successfully in the past (twice!), so I\nthought I\u2019d share my experience with you and hopefully save you a huge chunk\nof time. Also, the top-ranked Google search results for this topic are usually\nsemi \u2013 content marketing posts of bookkeeping software or lawyers, and I\nthought a more rant-focused post was exactly the thing which the world needs\nright now.\n\nThe usual disclaimer applies: I\u2019m a doctor, not a tax advisor. If in doubt,\nsearch out a real tax advisor (and/or doctor).\n\n## Step 0: Reminding Yourself That You Can Do It (15 minutes)\n\nI was scared of founding a company for a very long time because I thought I\ndidn\u2019t know enough about it. Here\u2019s what changed my mind and gave me self-\nconfidence: I ate a Kebab in Berlin. While eating it and staring at people, I\nlooked at the Kebab store and its owner dude. That made me realize that, yes,\nalso this Kebab store owner dude seems to have gone through this process\nsuccessfully. And with great success, too! Because he had customers (me) and\nwas making revenue (my money).\n\nSo if a Kebab owner dude can navigate the painful bureaucratic system in\nGermany while working grueling hours behind a Kebab grill, I might be able to\ndo so, too, sitting in my comfy home office while constantly overthinking\nthings.\n\nAs a side note, probably another data point that migrants might be better\nentrepreneurs.\n\nSo! Step 0: Remember that you can do this, and everyone started out clueless.\nThis is learning by doing.\n\n## Step 1: Do You Really Need a Company?\n\nIn simplified terms (I like those), you have two options if you want to launch\na business in Germany: A sole proprietorship (Einzelunternehmen), or a limited\nliability company (GmbH).\n\nIn even more simplified terms, here\u2019s a super-simplified \u201cflowchart\u201d of how to\ndecide what to choose:\n\n  * You want to hire people right now, or you\u2019re in a super risky industry where people get constantly sued: Choose a GmbH.\n  * Everything else: Choose an Einzelunternehmen\n\nIf you need more details, here\u2019s a quick comparison table. I won\u2019t go into\nmuch detail here though (let me know if you\u2019re interested) because this\narticle is about founding the GmbH. If the GmbH is not for you, you can\ncongratulate yourself an avoiding a lot of complexity (good job!) and stop\nreading here.\n\nEinzelunternehmen| GmbH  \n---|---  \nInitial share capital required| 0\u20ac| 12.5k\u20ac  \nFounding costs| Nearly free| ~900\u20ac  \nYearly bookkeeping costs| Nearly free| 1.000\u20ac \u2013 2.500\u20ac  \nMonthly bookkeeping costs| 0-100\u20ac| 100\u20ac \u2013 400\u20ac  \nLiability| You are personally liable| Liability limited to company  \nYearly profits taxed at| Your tax rate (up to 45%)| Corporate tax rate (30%)  \nGeneral complexity and pain| Low| High  \n  \nNow, assuming you still want to move forward with the GmbH, let\u2019s start\n(finally)!\n\n## Step 1: Choose a Name, But Don\u2019t Consult The Only People You\u2019re Allowed To\nConsult\n\nYou might think that choosing a name for your company would be trivial. This\nmight be true in startup-friendly and digitalized countries. Germany is\nneither.\n\nThe first and somewhat obvious aspect is that you can\u2019t choose a name which\nalready exists \u2013 so if someone else has founded Magic Software GmbH, you can\u2019t\nchoose that name. Look it up in the company registry (Handelsregister) here\n(be warned: Windows 95 vibes, and the website is down sometimes).\n\nThe second and much more confusing aspect is that, theoretically, your company\nname shouldn\u2019t consist of words which are commonly used. I noticed this when I\nattempted to found OpenRegulatory GmbH \u2013 the fact that \u201cOpen\u201d and \u201cRegulatory\u201d\nare both commonly used words makes this an invalid company name.\n\nYes, seriously!\n\nSo the obvious question is \u201cwhat are commonly used words\u201d. The answer is\nsimple, pretty much any word in a dictionary. Yeah, great.\n\nSo, if you want to name your company Magic Software GmbH, that\u2019s technically\nnot possible, because \u201cmagic\u201d and \u201csoftware\u201d are entries in a dictionary.\nHowever, if you name it Magic42 Software GmbH, that\u2019s totally fine, because\n\u201cmagic42\u201d is not in the dictionary.\n\nAnd now the next obvious question is \u201cwhy does this apparently not apply to\nother people\u201d, because there are lots of companies with \u201cinvalid\u201d names which\napparently exist: ResearchGate GmbH, Delivery Hero GmbH, GetYourGuide\nDeutschland GmbH.\n\nThe answer is that the enforcement of this rule is very random, and it\nliterally depends on whoever is in charge of entering your company name into\nthe registry. Different people have different interpretations of this rule,\napparently.\n\nSo can you get some sort of consultation whether your planned company name is\nokay? Yes, you can! There\u2019s one institution, called the IHK, which offers this\nservice.\n\nEvery company (includes yours in the future) has to become a member of the IHK\nand pay its fees, there\u2019s no way to opt out. If you think this sounds really\nshady, you might be on to something! The IHK prides itself on supporting\nbusinesses etc., but then again, you can\u2019t opt out, so I guess you just have\nto accept that they exist and do mostly-average-sometimes-very-mediocre work.\nThe likelihood that you\u2019ll ever get in touch with them and benefit from their\nwork is around 1%.\n\n.. And that 1% is right now, because the IHK is the only institution which has\nthe authority to tell you whether your planned company name might be\nacceptable.\n\nBut \u2013 stop right there \u2013 don\u2019t ask them, because their interpretation will be\nthe most unpragmatic interpretation you can imagine. Here\u2019s my abbreviated\ndialogue with them when attempting to found OpenRegulatory GmbH:\n\nOliver: I want to found a company called OpenRegulatory GmbH. Does that work?\nIHK: No. Because the name consists of common words. O: But what about ToolTime\nGmbH, JustWatch GmbH, RIDE GmbH, BioWink GmbH, etc.? IHK: That would depend on\nwhoever entered it into the registry that, it\u2019s subjective. You could add a\nnumber or a phantasy word (yes, seriously) to your name. O: What about spaces?\nOpenRegulatory123 vs. OpenRegulatory 123? IHK: Spaces don\u2019t matter. O: How\nabout OpenRegulatory.com GmbH? IHK: Domains are not allowed.\n\nAnd that, dear reader, is the story how I settled on \u201cOpenReg GmbH\u201d. A daily\nand painful reminder of arbitrary German bureaucracy.\n\nDon\u2019t ask the IHK about approval for your company name. Just go for it.\n\nBy the way, what happens if the person who enters it in the registry declines\nto enter your chosen company name? Then you have to repeat step 2 again and\nyou\u2019ll lose a few more weeks, see below.\n\n## Step 2: Find a Notary Public Who Picks Up The Phone\n\nYour next step is to actually incorporate your company. You might think\nthere\u2019s an online form for that. No, not in Germany. You have to make an in-\nperson appointment with a notary public \u2013 that\u2019s a person who reads out\ndocuments for a living and ensures it\u2019s actually you who appears at their\nplace, not e.g. a con artist who secretly incorporates companies under other\npeople\u2019s names (beware).\n\nSo time to pick up your phone, open Google Maps and search for a notary public\n(Notar) close to you.\n\nI\u2019ve collected some criteria how to select a suitable Notar:\n\n  * They pick up the phone.\n  * They actually are willing to give you an appointment and are not booked out.\n\nHigh, expectations, I know. Once you\u2019ve found a suitable Notar, they might\nsend you an email with one of those crappy PDF forms to fill out (yeah, those\nwithout text fields). You\u2019ll enter your address, company name (how you chose a\ngood one), articles of association and share capital. Talking about those two\nthings..\n\n### Step 2a: Articles of Association: Use The Musterprotokoll\n\nYour articles of association (Gesellschaftervertrag) contain the rules of your\ncompany, e.g. who owns how many shares and who can make decisions.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to draft one yourself though: You can use the official German\ntemplate (Musterprotokoll) which covers the most simple cases, e.g. if you\u2019re\na solo founder.\n\nIn all other cases, e.g. if you have Venture Capital investors (ugh), you\nmight have to use whatever your investors want and/or engage a lawyer to draft\none for you which opens yet another gigantic can of worms. I\u2019ll just skip that\npossibility here.\n\nInstead, the magic word is Musterprotokoll.\n\n### Step 2b: Share Capital: Two Hacks\n\nI skipped over this before in the spirit of simplification, but will have to\ngive you a brief summary on share capital now. In short, a GmbH needs 25k\u20ac\ninitial share capital, so that\u2019s the sum you\u2019ll be paying into the company\nbank account from your private savings. Luckily, the money doesn\u2019t disappear \u2013\nyou can use it within the GmbH to pay bills (most likely the ~1k\u20ac notary and\nincorporation costs which will become due soon!). But you can\u2019t use the 25k\u20ac\nprivately privately anymore as it\u2019s part of the company now.\n\nThere are two small hacks here which I\u2019ll just briefly mention:\n\n  * You could either only pay in half of it (12.5k\u20ac) and transfer the other 12.5k\u20ac some time later;\n  * Or, you could not found a GmbH but a UG instead which can have a share capital of less than 25k\u20ac, e.g. 4k\u20ac (choose a sum which is above the initial incorporation costs because otherwise your company will be bankrupt after a few days \u2013 not a good idea).\n\nFor simplicity\u2019s sake, I assume you\u2019re rich and have 25k\u20ac lying around which\nyou\u2019ll use to found your GmbH. I did found a UG in the past, too, with 4k\u20ac, so\nthat\u2019s your alternative.\n\n## Step 3: Finally Go To The Notary Public (Notar)\n\nNow, let\u2019s hope that you get an appointment at the Notar within the next two\nweeks or so. Let\u2019s also hope you spent the time in a productive manner and not\njust sitting around and watching YouTube videos like I did.\n\nGo to the Notar. Don\u2019t forget your ID or passport because that\u2019s their\nfoolproof way of identifying you and ensuring you are you and not a mysterious\ncon man setting up companies in your name.\n\nThe Notar will read out your company\u2019s articles of association to you. Yes,\nthey will read it out even though both of you already know it. And yes, even\nif you use the official German template, they will read it out.\n\nIt might seem ridiculous, two grown-up people sitting in a room and reading\nout a company incorporation template provided by the state. If you\u2019re\ncurrently learning German, you can treat it like a listening exercise (a very\nexpensive one).\n\nAfter that\u2019s done, you will sign various documents.\n\nAnd that\u2019s it! Your company is incorporated.. kind of. But you are not done at\nall and many days still lie ahead on your journey, young hobbit. On to the\nnext step.\n\n## Step 4: Receive Documents From Notar\n\nThe Notar will now finalize the documents you just signed and send them to\nyou. If they\u2019re super digital, they\u2019ll send you scans of the paper sheets you\nsigned via email. And if they\u2019re super fast, they\u2019ll send them on the same\nday. Remember: These are the documents you just signed, so the critical path\nhere is about one of the Notar assistants putting your just-signed documents\nin a scanner and sending them to you via email.\n\nThey might forget about it though, or they might only send it via snail mail.\n\n## Step 5: Find a Bank Account\n\nYour company is now in the weird situation of being partially incorporated.\nThis is resembled by the fact that you refer to your company now as \u201cMagic\nSoftware GmbH i.G.\u201d where the i.G. means it\u2019s currently being incorporated (in\nGr\u00fcndung). In theory, you could now sign contracts and send out invoices with\nthis weird name, but no one does that, because it seems a bit awkward.\n\nWhat you should do instead is set up a bank account, because you now have a\nchicken-and-egg situation:\n\nSituation: Your Notar needs proof that your company has a bank account and the\nshare capital (25k\u20ac) has been paid in to finish the official company\nregistration in the Handelsregister (= the Windows 95 website).\n\nProblem: To open a bank account, your company needs to be in the\nHandelsregister.\n\nThe easy solution to this is that most German banks allow you to open a\ncompany bank account even though you\u2019re not in the Handelsregister yet. Just\nbe sure to keep the \u201ci.G.\u201d thing behind your company name for the time being.\n\nTwo important points on how to save time here!\n\n  1. International \u201cstartup\u201d banks like Wise generally don\u2019t support this, so don\u2019t even try! You\u2019ll lose multiple days going back and forth with their support, like I did. You can open a Wise bank account later when you\u2019re properly incorporated.\n  2. All the old-school banks in Germany (those with brick-and-mortar branches) generally are super slow and will take multiple weeks to open your bank account.\n\nInstead, choose a startup bank which openly supports German companies which\nare currently being founded. In the past, I used Penta for that but they got\nbought by Qonto. From what I hear, the same should now be possible with Qonto.\n\nIf they\u2019re fast, you can get all of this done in a day (including the awkward\nKYC video call with a friendly person in an Eastern European country).\n\n## Step 6: Pay In Share Capital\n\nThe next step, for a change, doesn\u2019t involve waiting for a slow institution\nand is instead completely up to you: Pay in your share capital \u2013 those are the\n25k\u20ac I mentioned earlier. Your notary might have given you some hints on which\ntext they\u2019d like to see in the transaction description, e.g. \u201cStammeinlage\nGesellschafter <your name>\u201d.\n\n## Step 7: Forward Bank Account Paperwork To Notary\n\nOnce that\u2019s done and the share capital has arrived in your fresh new company\nbank account, you need two confirmations which you\u2019ll send to your notary:\n\n  * A confirmation that your company now has a bank account at whatever bank you chose earlier.\n  * The most recent account statement which shows that you paid in the share capital of 25k\u20ac.\n\nSend those PDFs to your notary via email.\n\n## Step 8: Waiting For The Notary And Registration In The Commercial Registry\n(Handelsregister)\n\nWith that confirmation in hand, your notary will now begin a highly\nsophisticated digital manoeuvre: They will perform an \u201cXML upload\u201d (yes) to\nthe German commercial registry (Handelsregister) to finalize your company\nregistration. Ah, and they will charge you for that, too, adding to your total\nincorporation costs of approximately 1k\u20ac (remember your listening exercise?).\n\nNow begins another waiting period, because this upload has to be manually\napproved by those famous people who approve company names (remember?. Not the\nIHK people (phew), but the actual people who work at the registry. As noted\nabove, these people have highly subjective and varying ideas about company\nnames, so the big question now is whether your name gets rejected if you used\ncommonly-used words.\n\nThis usually takes another 1-2 weeks, but it might take longer based on how\nbusy or understaffed the commercial registry is.\n\nTwo possible outcomes:\n\n  * Your name gets rejected. Sad dog face. Move back to step 2 and lose multiple weeks. Yes, seriously.\n  * Your name gets approved. You will receive a \u201cpreliminary invoice\u201d from the commercial registry.\n\n## Step 9: Pay Preliminary Invoice\n\nThe Handelsregister will send you a preliminary invoice (150\u20ac for me at the\ntime). You have to pay it so that your registration moves forward.\n\nYou can use your company bank account (with the 25k\u20ac in it) for that, because\nthese are, well, company-operational costs.\n\nIf you want to save a few days, you can in theory go there in person and pay\nin cash (yes, seriously). Not sure if it\u2019s worth it though.\n\n## Step 10: Download Confirmation From Commercial Registry\n\nThe waiting game now entails to check the Handelsregister daily by entering\nyour company name as a search term. After 1-2 weeks, it should be listed and\nyou can download a PDF confirmation of its listing which is your official\nproof that your company exists!\n\nYour notary will likely also be checking this and they\u2019ll also send you a\nconfirmation at some stage.\n\nSo are you done? Can you write invoices now? No. You still need your tax ID \u2013\nto be exact, two tax IDs. But before we get those, an important word of\nwarning.\n\n## Step 11: Danger: Brace For Handelsregister Spam\n\nThis is crazy and might make you feel like you\u2019re in a developing country. In\nshort, there are very shady organizations which monitor new entries in the\nHandelsregister, and they will send your company invoices which look like\ninvoices of the Handelsregister, but they are not (remember, you already paid\nthe 150\u20ac). They call these services \u201cregistry services\u201d or so and attempt to\nexploit the confusion of founders like you (can\u2019t blame you, the whole process\nis confusing).\n\nIgnore them and don\u2019t pay them.\n\nOnwards to the two tax IDs.\n\n## Step 12: Filling Out The Fragebogen Zur Steuerlichen Erfassung\n\nTake a deep breath, because this is just painful. Yes, your company is\nincorporated, but until now, the tax authorities don\u2019t know much about it.\nWait, you thought that your data was transmitted there automatically? Think\nagain.\n\nIt\u2019s now up to you to fix that by filling out a form called \u201cFragebogen zur\nsteuerlichen Erfassung\u201d. It can best be translated as \u201cquestionnaire for tax\nregistration\u201d.\n\nIt is 10 pages long. Yes, 10 pages! Even I as a German thought some of the\nquestions were quite tricky because they were written in bureaucratic German.\nHere\u2019s an example:\n\n> Die Gesellschaft ist in nur einem EU-Mitgliedsstaat ans\u00e4ssig und der\n> Gesamtbetrag \u2013 ohne Umsatzsteuer \u2013 der oben bezeichneten Ums\u00e4tze an in\n> anderen EU-Mitgliedstaaten au\u00dferhalb des Ans\u00e4ssigkeitsstaats ans\u00e4ssige\n> Nichtunternehmer \u00fcberschreitet im laufenden Kalenderjahr nicht 10.000 \u20ac und\n> hat dies auch im vorangegangenen Kalenderjahr nicht getan.\n\nDeepL translation attempt:\n\n> The company is domiciled in only one EU Member State and the total amount \u2013\n> excluding VAT \u2013 of the above-mentioned sales to non-entrepreneurs domiciled\n> in other EU Member States outside the country of domicile does not exceed \u20ac\n> 10,000 in the current calendar year and did not do so in the previous\n> calendar year.\n\nGood luck. Here are some quick pointers:\n\n  * Most important: Tick the checkbox to request a EU VAT ID \u2013 you\u2019ll need that for registering with online payment processors (Stripe, Paddle, etc.), and for writing invoices for customers in the EU (outside of Germany).\n  * Estimate your revenue at 0\u20ac for now unless you have real reason to believe otherwise (do you have paying customers lined up already? probably not). That way, you only have to pay corporate tax at the end of the year based on your actual profit (vs. having to prepay tax every quarter).\n  * Tick \u201cBargr\u00fcndung\u201d \u2013 you founded your company by paying in 25k\u20ac in cash, not by putting in random items (e.g. property).\n  * Tick \u201cSollversteuerung\u201d which means you pay taxes based on the invoices you send and receive, not based on money you actually send and receive (requirement for GmbH, I think).\n\nStill, the form is a pain. Good luck. The good news is that if you screw it\nup, your tax advisor can likely talk to the authorities and fix it. Talking\nabout tax advisors..\n\n## Step 12a: Finding a Tax Advisor And Bookkeeper\n\nIf you haven\u2019t noticed yet, dealing with the financial and tax authorities in\nGermany is a huge pain \u2013 not because they\u2019re evil people (they\u2019re often\nactually really nice!), but because of all the clunky systems and processes\naround it. Communication with them is often via physical snail mail. Some\nforms can be submitted electronically, others can not.\n\nAdditionally, your company is required to do monthly bookkeeping to, among\nother things, calculate the total VAT you charged your customers and\ntransferring that to the authorities. I still haven\u2019t fully gotten into how\nthe hell all of this bookkeeping works, and neither should you \u2013 you have\nbetter things to do, like running your company and generating revenue.\n\nSo my somewhat unfortunate recommendation is to look for a tax advisor who\nalso offers bookkeeping and outsource everything to them. Unfortunate, because\nI feel like this creates yet another middleman who profits from the complexity\nof the system.\n\nThe benefit is that you only have to upload your invoice PDFs every month to\nwhatever broken web portal your tax advisor offers, and they\u2019ll take care of\nthe rest, including handling questions of the tax authorities if they come up.\n\nThe costs for this differ, but a good rule is to select a tax advisor who\ncharges you a flat fee based on your company revenue. Other tax advisors\ncharge 100-150\u20ac / hr based on the hours they spend, not recommended.\n\nAs a side note, I\u2019m currently re-evaluating this \u2013 some \u201cnew generation\u201d tax\nadvisors offer more innovative approaches of enabling you to do your own\nbookkeeping in fancy SaaS software, while they only review it.\n\n## Step 13: Receiving Your Tax ID\n\nAfter your tax form (step 10) has been processed, you should receive your\ncompany\u2019s German tax ID in the snail mail. This tax ID will finally enable you\nto write invoices. It usually has the format of xx/xxx/xxxxx where x is a\nnumber. Add those to your invoices (\u201cSteuernummer: xx/xxx/xxxxx\u201d) and you\u2019re\nnow ready to create invoices!\n\nDon\u2019t confuse this with the EU VAT ID though which usually arrives slightly\nlater.\n\n## Step 14: Receiving Your VAT ID\n\nA few days later, your EU VAT ID should arrive, also via snail mail. Its\nformat is usually DEXXXXXXXXX where X is a number. You should add it to all\ninvoices because it\u2019s required for non-German EU customers. It\u2019s also required\nto sign up for payment processors like Stripe and Paddle.\n\n## Done!\n\nYou\u2019re done already! Only 12 steps and around 6 weeks in total, and your\nGerman GmbH is set up.\n\nNow you\u2019re ready for business! Hopefully your prospective customers haven\u2019t\ndisappeared while you were busy setting up your GmbH.\n\n## Optional Optimizations\n\nHere are a few optional ideas about what to do next:\n\n### Switch Banks?\n\nYou could move to a bank which is better and/or cheaper than your current\nbank, because now your search is no longer limited to banks which allow\npartially-incorporated companies. I use Wise as their offering is pretty good.\nThat being said, they have a weird habit of automatically deactivating\naccounts from time to time and their support is sometimes ridiculously bad, so\nI can\u2019t fully recommend them.\n\nIn a very ironic turn of events, you could even consider moving to a brick-\nand-mortar bank now! You\u2019re no longer in a rush as your company is already\nincorporated and has a bank account, and the benefit of brick-and-mortar banks\nis that they usually don\u2019t lock you out of your account randomly every now and\nthen. If you\u2019re undecided, that\u2019s also fine, because a company can have\nmultiple bank accounts. Why not have both?\n\n### Liquidity Planning\n\nLiquidity (money) planning: You\u2019ve got 25k\u20ac in your bank account, but that\nmight not last you very long. At the very least, all the fees including the\nnotary will reduce that by around 1k\u20ac, and if you pay yourself a salary or\nhire someone, money will disappear fast \u2013 an average software engineer in\nGermany can easily cost you 6-8k\u20ac / month. You could transfer more money to\nyour company by giving it a loan \u2013 make sure to create all the paperwork for\nthat though, i.e. create a loan contract (yes, with yourself) before you\ntransfer the money.\n\n## Tax Considerations\n\nSome quick thoughts about taxes.\n\n### Corporate Taxes & VAT In Germany\n\nGermany taxes company profits at approximately 30%. In simplified terms this\nmeans that, at the end of the year, whatever money is left over, gets taxed at\n30% \u2013 so make sure to not spend it (nervous chuckle). Here\u2019s an example: You\nreceive 200k\u20ac in money over the course of a year (revenue) and you spend 100k\u20ac\non costs like salaries and hardware. Your profit at the end of the year is\n100k\u20ac which gets taxed at 30%, so you have to pay 30k\u20ac in taxes and only keep\nthe remaining 70k\u20ac. Quite a lot of taxes here.\n\nYou charge your customers VAT and pay it at the end of the month: On your\ninvoices, you add VAT, e.g. when selling to German customers (19% currently).\nYou don\u2019t get to keep that though. Instead, you transfer the total VAT of each\nmonth to the tax authorities \u2013 so make sure you don\u2019t spend it. Things get\nmore complex if you sell stuff to customers within the EU, but outside of\nGermany. I\u2019ll skip that complexity here and maybe write about it another time.\n\n## Holding Company?\n\nTalking about taxes, there\u2019s one rather huge optimization you can do: Instead\nof owning your company yourself, you can create another company first which\nholds it.\n\nSo, specifically, the first setup I described above would look like this,\nlet\u2019s call it Scenario 1 (direct ownership):\n\nYou (private person) own 100% of shares of Magic Software GmbH.\n\nInstead, you could do this holding thing, let\u2019s call it Scenario 2 (holding):\n\nYou (private person) own 100% of shares of Magic Holding GmbH, and Magic\nHolding GmbH owns 100% of shares of Magic Software GmbH.\n\nWhat\u2019s the benefit? Let\u2019s look at how things are taxed with the 100k\u20ac profit I\nmentioned earlier.\n\n### Scenario 1: Direct Ownership\n\nMagic Software GmbH makes 100k\u20ac in profits. Those get taxed at 30%, so 70k\u20ac\nremain. If you want to pay out these profits to yourself (as you own 100% of\nthe company), you\u2019ll have to pay an additional ~26% capital gains tax on the\n70k\u20ac, so you end up with around 51k\u20ac.\n\n### Scenario 2: Holding\n\nMagic Software GmbH makes 100k\u20ac in profits. Those get taxed at 30%, so 70k\u20ac\nremain. If you want to pay those out, the first step is now to pay it out to\nMagic Holding GmbH, because that company is the owner of Magic Software GmbH,\nnot you.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the benefit: In simplified terms, you don\u2019t pay taxes then. So you\ntake 70k\u20ac out of Magic Software GmbH and pay it out into Magic Holding GmbH\nand still have 70k\u20ac.\n\nIn the Magic Holding GmbH, you could e.g. invest it in ETFs and leave it there\nuntil you really need it.\n\nAnd then, if you pay it out from Magic Holding GmbH to you personally, then\nyes, you pay ~26% capital gains tax \u2013 but the huge benefit here is that it\ncould accrue investment returns in the meantime!\n\nThere are also some pretty huge other optimizations here \u2013 e.g. you couldn\u2019t\neven take it out of your holding company and instead buy stuff within your\nholding company, like property or airplanes (yes, seriously) and then rent\nthat stuff out to you as a person. But this, dear reader, is pretty much\nexactly where my knowledge ends.\n\nI did end up going for the holding thing because the benefits really are\ngreat, and if you haven\u2019t noticed by now, if there\u2019s one thing Germans love,\nit\u2019s optimizing their taxes. The drawback of holding construct is that you\nhave to found your holding company first, so you have to go through all of\nthis twice.\n\nHope I saved you some time. Good luck!\n\n## Comments\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
