The chap (let\u2019s call him John) had seen some of my videos,\nand as we settled into dinner, he asked with full sincerity: \u201cSo Ali, how do I\nbecome successful?\u201d I smiled, settling nicely onto my soap box.\n\nHere\u2019s how the conversation went.\n\nJohn: So Ali, how do I become successful? Ali: Haha what does \u201csuccessful\u201d\nmean to you?\n\nJ: Ooh good question. I guess... right now, it means being able to do whatever\nI want. Being financially free. Not having to work if I don\u2019t want to.\n\nA: I see... that wouldn\u2019t be my personal definition of success...\n\nJ: What\u2019s your definition of success?\n\nA: Well for me, \u201csuccess\u201d is when you\u2019ve got a goal in mind and you\u2019re working\ntowards it while enjoying the journey. That means I can consider myself\n\u201csuccessful\u201d along every step of that journey, rather than just when I\u2019ve\n\u201carrived\u201d at a particular destination.\n\nJ: Haha okay nice that\u2019s a good definition. Okay so for me... I guess the goal\nI\u2019m working towards is to become a millionaire.\n\nA: Right... so to have a \u00a31m in the bank? In what sort of timeframe are we\nthinking here?\n\nJ: If I could have a million in the next 8 years, that would be amazing... If\nI had that, I\u2019d feel totally financially free, and feel like I can do whatever\nI want.\n\nA: Okay... For the record, I can basically guarantee that when you get there,\nyou\u2019ll set your sights higher than a million, but let\u2019s go with \u00a31m for now.\nSo if you want to make a million in the next 8 years, you need post-tax-and-\npost-expenses income of \u00a3125k every year for the next 8 years, right?\n\nJ: Huh yeah you\u2019re right, I guess I\u2019ve never thought about it in that way by\nactually doing the calculation lol.\n\nA: All good... so we\u2019ve got a goal in mind (to get a million in the bank in\nthe next 8 years). What\u2019s your current strategy for getting to that goal?\n\nJ: What do you mean?\n\nA: A goal is like the destination we\u2019ve got in mind, and the strategy is our\nplan to get there. So right now, your strategy for making money is being an RE\nteacher in a high school in London. If you continued with this strategy, do\nyou think you\u2019d reach your goal of \u00a31m in the next 8 years?\n\nJ: Absolutely not (laughing). Nowhere near that.\n\nA: Great! So we\u2019ve established that the strategy we\u2019re following isn\u2019t going\nto get us to the goal we\u2019ve got in mind. That means we can either (a) change\nthe goal, or (b) change the strategy. Which would you like to do?\n\nJ: Well I really want to be a millionaire, so let\u2019s change the strategy.\n\nA: Okay awesome! So... can we brainstorm some possible strategies for getting\nto \u00a31m in the next 8 years?\n\nJ: Huh... well I guess I could go into real-estate.\n\nA: You could. But to average \u00a3125k in post-tax-post-expenses income each year\nfor the next 8 years, you\u2019re going to need a lot of money to get started with\nreal-estate investing. Do you have a load of money to be able to invest?\n\nJ: Lol nope I\u2019ve got nothing. Okay so maybe real estate investment isn\u2019t the\nway... how about some sort of business?\n\nA: Great! I agree \u2013 starting and growing your own business could get you to\n\u00a31m in the next 8 years. How would you feel about that?\n\nJ: Yeah I\u2019d love to have my own business. But I don\u2019t really have any good\nbusiness ideas... and I\u2019ve been wanting to start a business for years, but\nI\u2019ve never really done it.\n\nAt this point, John presents a few different business ideas to me. Could he\nstart another private tutoring business? Could he start a business hiring\nsupply teachers and offering those to schools in London when their teachers\nare off-sick? Could he sell an online course about safeguarding? I get the\nvibe from the conversation that John\u2019s thinking about \u201cbusiness ideas\u201d in a\nsomewhat \u201cbeginner\u201d way. After a bit of back-and-forth about his business\nideas, I ask:\n\nA: Just out of curiosity, how many books have you read about starting a\nbusiness? J: Er... none...\n\nA: All good, I\u2019m just curious. And how many podcasts have you listened to\nabout starting a business or about making money?\n\nJ: Er... yeah I don\u2019t really listen to podcasts.\n\nA: No worries. And how many YouTube videos have you watched specifically about\nhow to start a business?\n\nJ: Er... yeah I don\u2019t really watch those sorts of YouTube videos.\n\nA: So can I just check I\u2019ve got this right? You\u2019ve been wanting to start a\nbusiness for many years, and you feel that starting your own business is the\nvehicle that could get you to your goal of financial freedom which is a really\nmeaningful goal for you... but you haven\u2019t read any books, watched any videos,\nor listened to any podcasts about starting a business?\n\nJ: Er yeah that\u2019s right (looks around sheepishly).\n\nA: Haha no worries, I\u2019m not saying that to be mean, just to point out\nsomething that I see a lot. I know a lot of people who would love to start a\nbusiness, but who for some reason, don\u2019t try to learn anything about the\nprocess. True, you learn a hell of a lot by just doing it... but if you\u2019re\ncompletely new to the world of business, then there\u2019s quite a lot of basic\ngroundwork that\u2019s worth understanding before diving into it.\n\nJ: Groundwork?\n\nA: Yeah... it\u2019s like if you\u2019re applying to medical school. You need to study\nchemistry, biology and maths at school, so that when you start learning\nMedicine, you\u2019ve got a basic foundation. If someone tried to join Medical\nschool without having a basic grounding in chemistry and biology, things would\nbe really tricky. In the same way, trying to start a business, especially one\nthat\u2019ll make you a millionaire, without having read anything about starting a\nbusiness, is going to hold you back quite a lot.\n\nJ: Okay so what would you suggest?\n\nA: Easy. I can give you a reading list of a few books to read, and a few\npodcasts to listen to, and those will immediately give you a huge firmware\nupdate in your brain about what sort of business ideas you might want to think\nabout, and how to go about starting a business that can make you a\nmillionaire.\n\nAt this point, everyone else around us (listening in to the conversation)\njumps in, asking if they could have the list too. I oblige. This is the list.\n\nBooks (in this order)\n\n  1. The Millionaire Fast Lane \u2013 MJ Demarco\n  2. Million Dollar Weekend \u2013 Noah Kagan\n  3. $100m Offers \u2013 Alex Hormozi\n  4. Dotcom Secrets \u2013 Russell Brunson\n\nPodcasts\n\n  1. My first interview with author & serial entrepreneur Daniel Priestley on Deep Dive\n  2. My second interview with author & serial entrepreneur Daniel Priestley on Deep Dive\n  3. My interview with business coach Robin Waite on Deep Dive\n\nSomeone looks at the list and says \u201clol these are all your podcasts?\u201d And I\nsay: \u201cYep. These are all interviews that are specifically all about how to\nmake your first $10k/month online, and I promise they\u2019ll answer a bunch of\nquestions you have about starting a business, and give you a bunch of things\nto consider that you never did before\u201d.\n\nTo somewhat attest to the power of this list (in particular the reading list),\naround 9 months ago, I shared the same list with a friend who took a break\nfrom his management consulting job to try and make money on the internet. This\nfriend was also a noob to the world of business, but after reading the books\non the list (minus Million Dollar Weekend which only came out a few weeks\nago), he said: \u201cMan I can literally never get another job again now that I\u2019ve\nread these books\u201d. He then built his own software which has grown over the\npast 9 months to be making $35k+ per month. Obviously, your mileage is going\nto vary and these results are atypical, but it speaks to the power of having\nthe right foundation (from these books) and applying single-minded execution\nto get rich lol.\n\nAnyway, it\u2019ll be interesting to see if John (or anyone else who took down the\nreading list) will actually read any of the books on it. I might see them at\nthe same birthday dinner next year and I\u2019ll ask them about it if I do \ud83d\ude42\n\nHave a great week!\n\nAli xx\n\nP.S. I\u2019ve been working on a secret project called Productivity Lab. It\u2019s a new\ncommunity designed to help you become your most productive self, all while\nenjoying the journey along the way. We\u2019ll be launching soon, and you can sign\nup for the waitlist here. We\u2019d love to have you x\n\n## \ud83c\udfac My New Videos\n\n\ud83e\udd11 A Step By Step Guide To Making $10,000 a Month \u2013 I recently interviewed\nserial entrepreneur Daniel Priestley and he told me about his step by step\nmethod, The CAOS Framework, which I wanted to share with you guys here. This\nis one of the best frameworks I\u2019ve come across for starting a business, so I\nhope you get some value from this video and are potentially inspired to start\nsomething of your own.\n\n\ud83d\ude80How to Grow a YouTube Channel From Nothing in 2024 \u2013 In this video, I sit\ndown with Izzy Sealey, a YouTuber with 500k subscribers, to talk about her\njourney on YouTube and what advice she would give to someone just getting\nstarted today. There\u2019s so much I wish I\u2019d known when I started YouTube myself,\nand Izzy captures a lot of that advice in this video, so I think you\u2019ll get\nvalue from it.\n\n## \u270d\ufe0f Quote of the Week\n\n\u201cBegin at once to live, and count each separate day as a separate life.\u201d\n\nFrom Letters from a Stoic by Seneca.
