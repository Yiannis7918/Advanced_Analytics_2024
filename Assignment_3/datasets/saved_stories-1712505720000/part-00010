I\u2019m a contemporary artist and have been living off of Medicaid,\nfood stamps, and $20k annually since graduating from art school five years\nago. I see the return policies offered by Bezos and the Waltons as loan\nagreements; I lend them $1,500, and the interest they pay is my use of a new\nhard drive. While TurboTaxing I hallucinate a DJ software skin and use the\nexpense estimate sliders as fraud modulators. I accept unpaid exhibition\noffers from salaried curators and gallerists in far-flung cities and tack on\nlecture stops at $150 a pop, spending as much time as possible as a guest in\ncirculation so as to avoid paying rent anywhere.\n\nThis hustle will continue for five more years, but right now I feel like I\u2019m\ngoing blue-chip because I\u2019m about to show new videos in four different\nbiennials. One of these new videos\u2014Ode to Seekers 2012\u2014is a loose adaptation\nof Keats\u2019s \u201cOde on a Grecian Urn\u201d and depicts 3D animated mosquitos, syringes,\nand oil pumps sucking and fucking a surface that looks, alternately, like\nhuman skin under a microscope, desert salt flats, or potato casserole. Set to\na remix I had made of Icona Pop\u2019s \u201cI Love It,\u201d the video is celebratory in\ntone, freeing me from what I\u2019ve begun to call the \u201ccottage industry of\ncritical art,\u201d [1] an echo chamber/conference room in which overeducated\ntryhards attempt to outperform each other with the most perfect politics\npossible. The video doesn\u2019t have a point; it\u2019s more like a knot.\n\nThese biennials will ultimately amount to a deficit due to their meager\nproduction budgets, but FedEx loses my Robin Williams Window Shade sculpture,\nand I collect $9,000 in insurance value. New York increasingly feels like a\nsexy jail or a 9/11-themed Sbarro, so I use the money to buy a 2000 Volvo S70\nwith 250,000 miles on it for $500 from my dad, who likes to fix up totaled\njalopies with his friend. The AC\u2019s cooked, but the summer is my window of\nopportunity, so I head west in late June to become an \u201cLA Artist,\u201d which to me\nis an indicator that one has achieved adequate exposure and now needs time and\nspace to focus on commissions to come.\n\nIn LA I realize it\u2019s impossible to get a lease when your income is an\ninsurance money bonanza and three \u20ac150 checks from European art schools. But I\nalso realize that if I answer, \u201cHow are you?\u201d with \u201cFine . . . I\u2019m looking for\na place to stay,\u201d everyone knows someone who needs a plant sitter. Rather than\nseeing the crust punk through the Lacoste or realizing that my storage unit is\nmy car trunk, people seem to think I\u2019m a rich kid with a Volvo quirk. Looking\nlike gay Abe Lincoln probably helps.\n\nArtsy portrait aboard the Queen Mary, 2016, by Emily BerlAndrew Norman Wilson,\nOde to Seekers 2012, 2016\n\nIn September I go to South Korea to show Ode to Seekers 2012 at the Gwangju\nBiennial. The beast mode I typically find myself in during the install-to-\nopening phase intensifies into a full-blown mania. At the press preview, I\ntake too much Adderall and start crying when asked what art is, tears that\nimply the inability of language to account for the sublime. I watch my piece\nover and over and decide my next project will be a 3D animated Humpty Dumpty\nvideo drawing from Lewis Carroll and James Joyce.\n\nBack in LA I\u2019m confronted with the reality that there will be no champagne\nreceptions, boutique hotel rooms, or complimentary car service for the\nforeseeable future. Instead, I live in a four bedroom on the far east side\nwith five to nine other artists. A former student visits and introduces me to\nhis wife and baby. I introduce him to a few of my twenty-three-year-old\nroommates and two guys who slept in the shed last night.\n\nI work on my laptop in my bedroom, so when the online art brokerage platform\nArtsy asks to photograph me in my studio for a \u201cTop Emerging Artists of 2016\u201d\nlisticle, I lie and say that I have Emirati collector-patrons who let me live\nand work in their long-term rental on the RMS Queen Mary, the retired British\nocean liner-turned-hotel in the port of Long Beach. I rent a suite for the day\nof the shoot. The photographer is very curious about my live/work situation,\nwhich unbeknownst to her, I\u2019ve only had for two hours. I tell her my patron\u2019s\ndaughter Abitha is still asleep in my room, and the whole family will get\nupset if we disturb her, so we should just take photos of me on the deck.\n\nAndrew Norman Wilson, The Unthinkable Bygone, 2016Barneys New York portrait at\nGrandma\u2019s house in Pasadena, CA, 2017, by Christopher Fragapane\n\nIt\u2019s 2017. A friend of a friend offers me a room in his grandmother\u2019s mansion\nfor $900 a month, which includes a private balcony over the pool. Grandma\nlives in a nursing home, so it\u2019s just me and this married couple living with\nher massive art collection. I feel like I\u2019ve won a WASP LARPer lottery.\nSomeone tips off Barneys New York about the boho-chic lifestyle I\u2019ve assumed\nat Grandma\u2019s, and they reach out to interview and photograph me for their fall\ncatalog. I ask a model what they would get paid for a shoot and propose $2,000\nto Barney\u2019s. They reject my proposal and offer a $1,000 gift card. I discover\na website that will turn the encrypted plastic into $940 cash and accept.\n\nI line all four walls of my studio with pictures of Barney the dinosaur\nimpersonators and tell the interviewer that I\u2019m working on a new project as a\nfollow-up to my 2016 video The Unthinkable Bygone, in which a 3D model of Baby\nSinclair from Jim Henson\u2019s animatronic puppet TV series Dinosaurs (1991\u20131994)\nis subjected to simulation, dissection, reflection, and endoscopy. I say I\u2019m\ninterested in pop cultural representations of the surfaces of dinosaurs, and\nhow we hollow out the earth to find dinosaur bones, and then use those bones,\nalong with our knowledge of current species, to literally flesh out vivid\ncaricatures about our unthinkable earthly predecessors. That bit doesn\u2019t run\nin the interview, but every photo he takes is full of bootleg Barneys.\n\nTo others my new life seems like it\u2019s all fun and games, but in actuality I\u2019m\nmiserable. The maxim \u201cmoney doesn\u2019t buy happiness\u201d starts to ring in my head.\nNot because I actually have money, but because I\u2019m living with the material\ncomforts of someone who does, and it doesn\u2019t seem to make me feel any better.\nI have the ugly feeling that an Artforum feature, institutional acquisitions,\nand another lap around the art world circuit would cure this sense of lack.\n\nBut Trump is in office, and my work is deemed less \u201curgent\u201d\u2014\u201cirresponsible,\u201d\neven. A curator who selected me for an Art Basel commission ghosts me. A\ngallerist who wants to work with me says she can\u2019t add a white man to her\nroster. An esteemed curator from the Middle East tells me I should probably\nget a day job for a while because my career outlook in the art world is bleak.\nIt becomes trendy to believe that images within contemporary art contexts can\ndirectly achieve the goals of political struggle. The proliferation of bad\nfaith gestures toward political change and the aestheticized consumption of\nother people\u2019s suffering sickens me, especially when these expressions still\nplay into the financial objectives of oil barons, arms dealers, and other\nvampires.\n\nAndrew Norman Wilson, Kodak, 2018Rock face on Isla Esp\u00edritu Santo in La Paz,\nMexico, 2018\n\nIt\u2019s 2018. I\u2019m in Hasselt, Belgium. Everything I eat is off-white, including a\nKoninginnehapje, a puffed pastry tower filled with boiled chicken balls and\ncream. I\u2019m there to install a video at an institution called KRIEG? about my\nfather\u2019s thirty-three-year career as a Kodak technician. Last year a respected\ncurator convinced me to make the work, citing \u201cemergent image regimes,\u201d\n\u201cimmaterial labor,\u201d and other terms she probably pulled from PDFs she read in\ngrad school. I took the bait for funding\u2019s sake and spent the next year\ntoiling in Adobe Creative Suite. I should have stood my barren ground and made\nsomething from the heart.\n\nI decide I need a vision quest. I google \u201cbest beaches in the world\u201d and look\nfor one that I can convince KRIEG? to fly me to on my way back to Los Angeles.\nI settle on Balandra Beach in La Paz, Mexico, find a subletter for my room at\nGrandma\u2019s, and book an apartment for a month of fuego p\u00e1lido.\n\nI take a snorkeling excursion in the Gulf of California to Isla Esp\u00edritu\nSanto, which is inhabited by thousands of sea lions. As I track a manta ray\nfifty feet below me, something nudges my elbow. I turn to find a sea lion pup\nswimming alongside me. We make eye contact. He winks, then accelerates past me\ntoward an underwater arch. I follow him through the opening, and when I\nsurface for air, I find myself surrounded by adult sea lions. They gaze at me,\nmotionless. I have a feeling I might die. I\u2019ve found what I was looking for on\nthis island. Something that feels like the opposite of scrutinizing a\nnondescript object in a white room and then having to read a citation-heavy\npress release to find out that the object is the product of prison labor, and\nprison labor is bad.\n\nFake Friends flier, Andrew Norman Wilson, 2018Hyatt Regency mezzanine\nwaterfall in Princeton, NJ, 2018\n\nAt Princeton that fall I\u2019m the token artist at an art history symposium.\nDelirious and jet-lagged, I quietly observe the graduate students as they\ngrovel for the academic superstars they\u2019ve flown in to present papers on the\n\u201cLimits of Analogy in the Wake of the Social Turn in Art\u201d and \u201cPredicated\nInternationalism.\u201d Instead of the pseudoacademic presentation I prepared, I\nspew raw accounts of my artistic process into the room. The superstars eat it\nup like seabirds.\n\nSuddenly I\u2019m the star. I get overconfident and pound shots with a Penn\nprofessor, then snort powders with a grad student. I\u2019m quickly too far gone\nand take an Uber back to my hotel alone. When the receptionist checked me into\nthe Hyatt Regency earlier that day, I was told the general manager used to be\na production designer. The brass penguins stoically wading around the\nsandstone and marble mezzanine waterfall suggest Inception meets Lost in\nTranslation meets Happy Feet. One of them sits loosely on its mount, so I pick\nit up and start walking.\n\nA hotel employee approaches me and asks about the penguin. I don\u2019t know what\nI\u2019m doing. I tell her that, and she calls her supervisor. By the time the\nsupervisor arrives, a thought emerges: I\u2019m dissociating. But something about\nthe way I address that thought out loud gets the supervisor going on about the\npolice. The adrenaline hits, and I start to remember I have some cards to\nplay. I\u2019ve been teaching as an adjunct at UCLA, so I can say I\u2019m a professor.\nI\u2019m in town for a conference at Princeton. I\u2019m jet-lagged from a site visit to\na German Kunstverein. I hand her the brass penguin and plead insanity. She\nwants me to pack my bags and leave the premises, but I have no money and\nnowhere else to go. She doesn\u2019t buy that a professor can\u2019t afford a hotel room\nin New Jersey and tells me I can choose to sleep in jail or a mental hospital.\nI choose the latter.\n\nIn the morning, a psychiatrist tells me I\u2019m not insane but sends me back to LA\nwith a set of goals. I\u2019m going to slow down. Drink less. Start therapy. Get\nserious about meditation. When I return home, the married couple tells me I\nhave to move out of Grandma\u2019s mansion because they no longer want a roommate.\n\nAndrew Norman Wilson, Papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 Pikachu, 2019Lawnmower Man screening in the\nlaundry room of Combo hostel, Milan, Italy, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s 2019. A clan of Italian businessmen who collect video art offers me\n$8,000 to make a new video for an important institutional solo show. At $4,000\nless than the going rate for my .movs, this is a raw deal, but I don\u2019t have\nbetter offers. The Princeton psychiatrist\u2019s instructions prove unfeasible as I\nburn through housesits. In Koreatown, the papillon I\u2019m taking care of sprains\nher ankle doing zoomies. In Los Feliz, rats eat through my Volvo\u2019s fuel sensor\nwiring. For two weeks, I ride an old mountain bike around like a repeat DUI\noffender to demeaning little gigs like cleaning the floor of an art gallery.\nAn opportunity to catsit my friend Dena\u2019s Scottish Fold in Chinatown opens up,\nso I escape to New York. Back in sexy jail, I\u2019m so poor that I toy with the\nidea of posting my banking login info as a publicity stunt: having $0 isn\u2019t\ngoing to make life that much harder than having $11. When hunger strikes\naround noon some days, I order a coffee at a posh restaurant and pay\nimmediately; when another diner leaves leftovers, I bag them and scurry out.\n\nI fly Spirit to Chicago, where all my friends are too busy buying property or\naccepting professorships to try the ketamine a guy gave me for letting him\nsuck my dick. I catsit for my friend Eli, who is set for life thanks to his\nrole as the brains behind Cards Against Humanity. The cat mauls the papier-\nm\u00e2ch\u00e9 Pikachu I made for the video. I\u2019m on the verge of a nervous breakdown\npreparing for the shoot, where I\u2019ll play producer, director, art director,\nprop master, PA, and driver. But the labor proves fruitful when I realize Z =\n|Z/Z\u2022Z-1 mod 2|-1 is a work of almost palpable infinity\u2014which is to say, one\nof the best things I\u2019ve ever made. When it\u2019s time to exhibit the work, I don\u2019t\nhave any budget left over to pay for housing in Milan. A curator arranges for\na residency at an art hostel called Combo in Navigli under the condition that\nI curate a program of films, which I present in the laundry room. After the\nshow opens, I wander around town listening to Fiona Apple through noise-\ncanceling headphones and look at luxury clothing I can\u2019t afford. Four art\nmagazines publish reviews that read like whispers of a secret society speaking\nin code.\n\nAndrew Norman Wilson, In the Air Tonight, 2020A funding application, 2020\n\nIt\u2019s 2020. I\u2019ve moved to New York to teach at Cooper Union. I tumble through\nthree short-term sublets and then stick the landing: a $1,400 1.5 bedroom a\nblock away from Cooper Square. Everyone\u2019s stealing from Barneys New York. The\ndepartment store is going out of business and has replaced their staff with\nindifferent temp employees. I put on a shimmering $4,000 Prada suit in the\ndressing room, pull my regular clothes over it, and walk out of the store.\n\nI\u2019m selected as a finalist for a professorship at the State Academy of Fine\nArts in Stuttgart, Germany, though the call for applications listed a\npreference for female candidates. German teaching jobs are the golden ticket\nof the academic art world. I would start at $90k per year even though it\u2019s\neffectively part-time\u2014so part-time I wouldn\u2019t have to live in Stuttgart\u2014and\nI\u2019d have the same pension plan as Angela Merkel. I arrive on campus in my\nshimmering suit to compete with the other two finalists. After my talk three\nfaculty pick me apart: I don\u2019t live in Germany, my exhibition schedule is too\nbusy to devote sufficient time to my students, and I\u2019m male. While it\u2019s easy\nto rebut the first two accusations, there\u2019s not much I can say about the\nthird.\n\nBack in New York, a global pandemic takes hold. My rentier cancels his cross-\ncountry bike trip and kicks me out of his apartment. I fly back to LA and\nfinish teaching remotely from a housesit in Echo Park. None of my students\nseem to be able to make art anymore. Meanwhile, I compulsively spend at least\ntwelve hours a day stitching together clips from commercial cinema of the\neighties and nineties to make a narrative video about the urban legend behind\nPhil Collins\u2019s \u201cIn the Air Tonight.\u201d The budget amounts to $400 total to pay\nthe narrator. My mom says it\u2019s the best thing I\u2019ve ever done. The curators I\nsend it to mostly respond with politely veiled indifference; one even says\nit\u2019s \u201cnot what the world needs right now.\u201d I release it on the Phil Collins\nsubreddit.\n\nA locations page from the Art Director deck, 2020A shot description page from\nthe Balenciaga campaign deck, 2020\n\nI\u2019m awarded an artist residency at La Becque on Lake Geneva. Switzerland\ngrants me a business travelers\u2019 permit based on the (false) premise that I\nwould shoot a film with a Swiss cast and crew. In actuality, I have no money,\nand no idea what I\u2019ll make. The week before leaving I start a sequel to Z =\n|Z/Z\u2022Z-1 mod 2|-1 called Art Director and spend every hour of daylight\ndocumenting how Hollywood fantasies are made material throughout LA\u2014as if the\nresidents desire to live amid set constructions and movie characters. I shoot\nBavarian shopping plazas, an animatronic dinosaur car wash, and a \u201cNative\nAmerican\u201d-themed Taiwanese restaurant.\n\nWhile at La Becque, I secure \u20ac20,000 from an obscure Czech arts organization\nfor Art Director. A curator at the Centre Pompidou informs me that the project\nwill be proposed as a grant-funded exhibition at an upcoming meeting. I start\nassembling a team. We\u2019ll shoot from a Jeep Wrangler with a camera mounted in\nthe back like a gatling gun. Suddenly the visual director of Balenciaga\nreaches out and asks if I want to direct their next series of campaign videos.\nThe team essentially wants to pay me $100k to remake Z = |Z/Z\u2022Z-1 mod 2|-1\nwith Balenciaga products.\n\nA week before we\u2019re about to shoot, Europe goes into its second lockdown, and\nthe campaign is postponed until March. I decide I\u2019ll shoot Art Director when I\nreturn to LA in January, then go back to Europe in March for Balenciaga. Days\nlater, I get an email informing me that the Czech program has been Covid-\ncanceled. Then I hear back from the curator at the Pompidou. Apparently two\n(American) committee members vetoed the project because it didn\u2019t address LA\u2019s\nhomeless population. I\u2019ll be homeless in LA if I return, so I extend my stay\nin Switzerland.\n\nSwimming in Lake Geneva, Switzerland, 2020\n\nI had gotten into high-intensity interval training early on in the pandemic\nbecause it seemed like I could get canceled for jogging outside. On a cold\nNovember day, while writhing around on the floor for a move called \u201ccross-\nlateral bicycle kicks,\u201d I feel a sharp pain in my abdomen and an immediate\nwave of crippling nausea. I crawl into bed and remain there for the next two\ndays. When I emerge, the nausea persists, and I can no longer digest food\nproperly.\n\nFor as long as I can remember, one of my floating ribs has protruded out of my\nabdomen like a baby finger. Though it points in the opposite direction of my\ninnards, it\u2019s rather mobile, and I suspect it could have pinched my\nintestines. A Swiss doctor says he\u2019ll have to run a bunch of tests and I\nshould wait to begin my \u201cmedical adventure\u201d once I\u2019m back home.\n\nI try to frame the rest of my time in Switzerland as convalescence. Swimming\nin the thirty-five-degree water offers me an hour of relief, but the holidays\nare approaching, and it\u2019s offensive to refuse all the fondue and white wine. I\nsuffer through protracted dinners as residents suggest diseases I\u2019ve never\nthought about: Crohn\u2019s, peptic ulcers, diverticulitis, celiac disease. While\ngoogling them one evening, a Sundance programmer calls me. He says they want\nto show In the Air Tonight at next year\u2019s festival. \u201cGet your pitch decks\nready,\u201d he says. When I send the deck for Art Director, the team tells me the\nproject is \u201cbeyond arthouse\u201d and that I should come up with an idea for a\nnarrative short.\n\nMy avatar at the Sundance Film Festival Film Party, 2021My medieval-themed\nAirbnb/Peerspace in Burbank, CA, 2021\n\nIt\u2019s 2021. I rent a medieval-themed Airbnb/Peerspace in Burbank at a fraction\nof its usual cost because LA is currently the global epicenter of Covid. I get\nmy food holes inspected at a shadowy Medicaid-accepted facility called the\nAirport Endoscopy Center. The Capitol is stormed, so I watch a lot of cable\ntelevision as I wait for Balenciaga, Sundance, and MyChart results. I see\nAriel Pink strung out at Tierra Mia in Highland Park and then on TV getting\ninterviewed by Tucker Carlson.\n\nA January chill besets LA, so I start wearing the winter attire included in\nthe Sundance swag bag alongside an Oculus Rift. The image of me sporting an\nIMDb beanie and a Canada Goose jacket in a medieval-themed sharing economy\nrental is lost at the virtual industry events, where my body is rendered as a\nSundance-branded 3D figure with a 2D image of my face in place of a head.\nEveryone else\u2019s avatars meet up with friends from film school, previous\nshoots, and past networking events. I dawdle in the floating space lounge by\nmyself, thinking, They don\u2019t know I was just diagnosed with irritable bowel\nsyndrome.\n\nOther festivals reach out about my \u201cSundance film,\u201d as do companies like\nSearchlight and A24. One of the Nomadland producers calls me; instead of\nsaying hello, he yells, \u201cWHO is this Andrew Norman Wilson everyone\u2019s talking\nabout?\u201d My pitches of my short film idea Impersonator\u2014about a Hollywood\nBoulevard character impersonator who drifts deeper into the fantasy of their\ncharacter\u2014are deemed feral.\n\nI wander around on foot to prepare the short because driving my Volvo makes me\nnauseous. I meet a Stormtrooper impersonator on the boulevard named Dante\nValentine who plays in a hair metal band and founded what he describes as a\n\u201clife coaching program\u201d for \u201cAsian businessmen\u201d who want to become pickup\nartists. While walking around the LA River, I meet a man named Tony who makes\na living fixing bikes and trading them to other people who live on the\nstreets. In a past life he worked in McMansion construction, was wrongfully\naccused of a crime, spent years in prison, and upon release, fell into debt. I\nfind an affinity with both of them; Dante because of his parasitic\nrelationship to financial elites, Tony because I may be trading him Volvo\nparts for a bike soon.\n\nHollywood mounting Blaze in Laurel Canyon, CA, 2021Hollywood dead in his grave\nin Laurel Canyon, CA, 2021\n\nI\u2019m forced to make way for another tenant at the medieval-themed Airbnb and\nend up tortoise/turtle/iguana/dove/koi-sitting in Laurel Canyon for a German\ncommercial director. Every morning, I wake up and hurl $20 worth of vegetables\naround the property for the pets before spending eighteen hours preparing my\nshort film. I fly my parents out to help me because it\u2019s cheaper than hiring\nPAs. I can\u2019t think straight due to the chronic nausea, and it seems like I\u2019m\nspending $50 per second on set. At the end of the shoot, I\u2019m $40k in debt and\nseverely constipated.\n\nI have a bunch of cops\u2019 phone numbers, both to research their procedures and\nbecause I had to hire real cops to make sure the fake cops in the movie\nweren\u2019t frisking actual citizens or pulling them over in the LAPD truck we\nrented. I have never engaged with the world so deeply as an artist.\n\nAndrew Norman Wilson, Impersonator, 2021. Production still by Kyle Devan.\n\nBack in the canyon, one of the tortoises I\u2019m watching\u2014Hollywood\u2014is\nunconscious. I flip him over and find that he\u2019s bleeding from his penis.\nAnimal control asks if Hollywood lives with a female tortoise. I tell them her\nname is Blaze. \u201cIs she bigger than him?\u201d they ask. \u201cYes,\u201d I say. \u201cAre they\nsexually active?\u201d Hollywood spends every waking moment trying to fuck the\nliving daylights out of her. There\u2019s the explanation: Blaze broke Hollywood\u2019s\ndick off, and now he\u2019s dead.\n\nI call the German commercial director. He\u2019s devastated and needs time to\nthink. Awaiting further instruction, I put Hollywood\u2019s corpse in a black trash\nbag and leave him in the shade. Three days later the German returns. We bury\nHollywood in a massive hole in the ground, and I move out.\n\nMy George H.W. Bush baseball card, 2021Ziggles the bunny in Durham, NC, 2021\n\nToo sick to hustle for housesits like I used to, I decide to move into my\nparent\u2019s two-bedroom ranch house in North Carolina, where I file for\ndisability and set up a whole new stable of doctors to administer obscure\ntests. I consume radioactive eggs from a paper cup for a gastric emptying\nstudy so they can shoot gamma rays at my intestines to track the movement of\nthe egg down my chute. I buy a George H. W. Bush baseball card that depicts\nhim at age ninety-one throwing out the first pitch at an Astros game. I tell\nmy mom and dad that he\u2019s my spirit animal. My mom says her friend\u2019s daughter\nsaid white people can\u2019t have spirit animals. My dad, who voted for Bush twice,\nasks where my wife is.\n\nThe only being I\u2019m really vibing with in the house is my mom\u2019s rabbit,\nZiggles. He approaches me with a gentle curiosity whenever I enter the\nsunroom. He lets me style him with tiny sunglasses and sit him upright like a\nlittle man to watch the subtitled films my parents complain about. Nine months\npass down there. I start writing a feature-length script based on\nImpersonator. Logline: a fugitive hacker hiding as a Hollywood Boulevard\nimpersonator is recruited by a rogue FBI agent for a black-ops mission to\nsteal millions from a debauched doomsday prepper\u2019s desert compound.\n\nText from my mother, 2022One of my debt accounts, 2022\n\nIt\u2019s 2022. My therapist suggests I take a trip to see friends because I keep\ncalling myself an incel. I have a feeling she\u2019s sick of watching a grown man\ncry about how hard it is to poop and wants new material. I accept a designer\ncat-sitting gig in Brooklyn and find that the affection of old friends\ndistracts me from my condition. But city life becomes untenable as winter\nturns to spring. A close friend in the throes of baby panic seduces me into a\nrelationship and then berates me for two months because of the glaring reality\nthat I\u2019m unfit to be a dad. I take three editing gigs with fixed fees that\nfactor out to less than $10 per hour in the end. I can\u2019t take the train or\nlook at my phone while walking without becoming nauseous for twenty-four\nhours, can\u2019t drink alcohol or stay up past nine, and can\u2019t follow through on\nhalf of the plans I make. Meeting the film producers, creative directors, and\nagents I need to know feels impossible. I start to compose a suicide note and\nprocure twenty Xanax from a friend.\n\nThen, an electric signal jolts me out of the murk. I receive an invitation to\na director\u2019s lab called Oxbelly run by a powerful film producer and held at a\nGreek resort. I fly out with my Impersonator script for a week of meetings,\nworkshops, and production exercises. All the other fellows have film school\npasts and industry experience, rendering me a bit of an enigma. A famous actor\nwho I call the Green Goblin seems to like this. He accidentally pulls up a\npicture of his wife\u2019s breasts when he\u2019s trying to show me a picture of his\ngoat. I return home motivated to start a new script based on a love triangle\nset in Switzerland.\n\nMy floating rib (red) and the position it should be in (blue), 2022My rib,\n2022\n\nGoogling medical conditions, I find something I\u2019ve never heard of before:\nSlipping rib syndrome. There\u2019s a Facebook advocacy group with six thousand\nmembers, and everyone seems to be talking about three surgeons. Medicaid will\ncover the one in Connecticut. Three months later, I go in for surgery to sew\nthe \u201chypermobile floating rib\u201d to my ribcage to keep it from poking my\nintestines. When I wake up from the anesthesia, the surgeon says the rib\npopped out and pointed forward when he opened me up, so he decided instead to\nsaw off three inches. I request the bone. The surgeon refuses. \u201cIt\u2019s a\nbiohazard,\u201d he says. I ask every nurse and PA I see, and they say taking body\nparts home is illegal.\n\nTwo days later, I return to the hospital to sort out an issue with my\nOxyContin prescription. The surgeon says he\u2019ll come meet me. When he arrives\nat my table in the cafeteria, he puts a urine sample container in front of me.\nInside it is my rib, with meat still attached to the bone, sitting in hydrogen\nperoxide. He tells me to leave it in there for a week until the meat\ndissolves.\n\nMy digestive issues improve, and I have a new lease on life. No one wants to\nlisten to an artist describe their work, but everyone wants to be told my rib\nstory. I tell them God will use the bone to create a third gender. Even if it\ndoesn\u2019t work out between this new being and me, I\u2019m able to autofellate. I now\nhave half an hourglass figure and, naturally, am starting an OnlyFans. I will\nwork my angles, pay off my medical debt, and pivot to directing Hollywood\nblockbusters.\n\nOneohtrix Point Never, Nightmare Paint, 2023. Production still by Jeannie Sui\nWonders.\n\nIt\u2019s 2023. Crapping is easy now; sometimes too easy. While the same can\u2019t be\nsaid for making money, I haven\u2019t been this liquid for quite some time. I shoot\na skincare advertisement featuring Hailey Bieber draped across a giant pink\nbean; a music video for U2 at an abandoned housing development of over seven\nhundred cheap French chateau replicas in rural Turkey; and two music videos\nfor Oneohtrix Point Never that feel more like my work than promotional\ncontent.\n\nMeanwhile, I feel like a retired contemporary artist. My .mov files are\nentombed in the collections of institutions such as MoMA, the Getty, and the\nPompidou, but I haven\u2019t had a studio visit in years. I\u2019ve given up on trying\nto get projects such as Art Director and Humpty Dumpty funded or looking for\nteaching jobs. I avoid openings and even gallery exhibitions altogether.\n\nI used to think being an artist would allow me to step beyond reason toward\nwhat ought to be, to disturb the seemingly natural order of things and unwind\nour counterfeit intuitions. But I\u2019m fairly certain that the art world\u2014caught\nas it is between the demands of yacht owners and delusional incompetents with\nadvanced deskilling degrees\u2014won\u2019t let me do so. Instead, I\u2019ll defect and let\nothers get bullied into making evangelical pablum, financial instruments,\ninterior decor, identity flags, conceptual contracts, tech demos, checked\nboxes, \u201cresearch,\u201d encrypted Marxism, postcolonial apologia, excuses,\ncomplaints . . .\n\nIt\u2019s 2024. I\u2019m getting close to shooting that romantic thriller in\nSwitzerland. Logline: in the Swiss town of Interlaken, a love triangle forms\nbetween an avalanche survivor, a newly broke oil industrialist\u2019s son, and a\nmysterious influencer who might be a spy. The fate of humanity hangs in the\nbalance.\n\nI write this series of vignettes as part of my attempt to achieve escape\nvelocity from the predicament described herein. The compensation exceeds any\nfee I\u2019ve received for an exhibition. Its audience will be larger, and it will\nalways be available to them.
