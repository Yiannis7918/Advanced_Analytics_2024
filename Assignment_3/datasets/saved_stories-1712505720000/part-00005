However, the model's ability to perform ICL is sensitive to the\n> choice of the few-shot demonstrations. Instead of using a fixed set of\n> demonstrations, one recent development is to retrieve demonstrations\n> tailored to each input query. The implementation of demonstration retrieval\n> is relatively straightforward, leveraging existing databases and retrieval\n> systems. This not only improves the efficiency and scalability of the\n> learning process but also has been shown to reduce biases inherent in manual\n> example selection. In light of the encouraging results and growing research\n> in ICL with retrieved demonstrations, we conduct an extensive review of\n> studies in this area. In this survey, we discuss and compare different\n> design choices for retrieval models, retrieval training procedures, and\n> inference algorithms.\n\nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI);\nInformation Retrieval (cs.IR)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2401.11624 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2401.11624v5 [cs.CL] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2401.11624arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Man Luo [view email] [v1] Sun, 21 Jan 2024 23:34:42 UTC (178 KB) [v2]\nTue, 23 Jan 2024 03:35:40 UTC (178 KB) [v3] Tue, 13 Feb 2024 20:46:32 UTC (178\nKB) [v4] Tue, 12 Mar 2024 04:38:53 UTC (183 KB) [v5] Sat, 23 Mar 2024 16:35:45\nUTC (183 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled In-context Learning with Retrieved\nDemonstrations for Language Models: A Survey, by Man Luo and 4 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2401\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI cs.IR\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
