This means I spend a lot of time\ndoing it and occasionally, the hours can fly by quickly. Especially with\npersonal projects. It's tempting to say \"just 5 more minutes,\" so you can\nfinish something, then 5 hours later in 3AM it's \"almost done.\" Some might say\nthat's dedication, but I say it's poor self-control and planning. If you need\n14 alarm snoozes the next day just to get yourself back into consciousness,\nyou're not working hard; you're working stupid.\n\nBy definition, a workaholic is:\n\n> [...] a person who works compulsively. A workaholic experiences an inability\n> to limit the amount of time they spend on work despite negative consequences\n> such as damage to their relationships or health.\n\nBut in my opinion, a true workaholic goes one step further, beyond their\naddiction. They realize that by focusing on their well-being, they can\nactually do more work in the long run, fulfilling the higher purpose of\naccomplishing more.\n\n## The wrong addiction\n\nThere will always physically exist only 24 hours in the day, so if you \"work\nmore\" during the night, you're not making more time out of thin air. You're\nborrowing time, which is inefficient because:\n\n  * During the night, after several hours of work already, your brain has probably melted and is operating at a significantly lower capacity\n\n  * You will be handicapped the next day due to lack of proper sleep. Watch this TED talk by Matt Walker(opens in new tab) to understand exactly how bad that is\n\nSure, you might be doing more work than \"most people,\" as in \"spending more\nhours at once,\" but that's the wrong metric. Let's say you accomplish\nsomething for 4 hours in the night. What if you could rest and do it the next\nday for just 1 hour in the morning? There will always be people who can do\nthings way slower than you and way quicker. It only makes sense to measure\nyourself against yourself.\n\nIt's easy to think you're working harder than others because you spend the\nnights working. Some call it \"hustling\" or \"the grind,\" but for me that's\nnothing more than a toxic clich\u00e9. You might beat the majority of people in\nterms of sleep deprivation and quality of life deterioration, but not so much\nin terms of achievements. Working more and achieving more aren't correlated.\n\nIf you really want to get the maximum number of things done, you shouldn't\nstrive to spend as much time working as you can because, as I've already\npointed out, you're just borrowing time. You should instead focus on the\nquality, efficiency, and productivity of that constant time you have\nallocated. This forces you to think outside the box, cut out everything\nunnecessary, and focus on the essential.\n\n## The right addiction\n\nIf you don't believe that mind-body teamwork is essential, then you've\nprobably never experienced neither true health, nor your own peak performance.\nIt's hard to break out of the vicious cycle, get your shit together, and see\nwhat you're really capable of. But until you do that, you'll be spinning the\nsame hamster wheel, thinking you're working \"real hard.\"\n\nTo me, true workaholics are people who actually want to get things done, even\nif that means *gasp* living healthy:\n\n  * You have a sleep schedule\n\n  * You treat your sleep schedule as if it was a date with Emma Watson on the top of the Eiffel Tower\n\n  * You avoid caffeine because it could make you late for your date and can also leave you with energy crashes. It also doesn't make sense to have a cup of liquid dictate whether you wake up or not\n\n  * You avoid sugar because it prevents the otherwise inevitable sugar crash. Getting further away from diabetes is a nice little side-effect too\n\n  * You exercise frequently to avoid chronic (back) pain. Even if you might not notice it, it's harder to use your brain and think when you're in constant pain, because pain is not pleasant, obviously...\n\nIt's a simple feedback loop:\n\n  1. Taking care of yourself improves your performance and well-being\n\n  2. Your high performance means you can finish things more quickly\n\n  3. Finishing things more quickly leaves you with time to take care of yourself\n\nYou just need that initial push and then to maintain this cycle.\n\nA high-functioning workaholic doesn't obsess over the number of hours they\nspend working. Instead, they set a limited window of time for work and obsess\nover their output during that window. Apart from better health habits, they\nwork on other inefficiencies. For example:\n\n  * A low-functioning workaholic spends the nights writing emails\n\n  * A high-functioning workaholic makes an investment to learn and increase their typing speed with touch typing(opens in new tab)\n\n## My recent all-nighter\n\nI was building a project called QuarterTime(opens in new tab) that shows you\nyour remaining workdays and workhours for the current quarter of the year,\nexcluding vacations. The idea is to be able to visually see your available\ntime and plan better. Or, more accurately, to know if you're running out of\ntime and you're fucked.\n\nAfter dragging the project along for a couple of weeks, I decided that I\nwanted to finally finish it on one specific Monday and committed. It wasn't\nreally a deadline, because nobody had told me to do it, but I decided to do it\nanyway as a little \"endurance\" challenge. Well, I got to bed at 4AM after\nroughly 20 hours of screen time (I was at work prior to that). Yeah, I got\nthrough it, but felt like a bag of cement the next day and it took ~3 days for\nthe back pain to go away.\n\nFurther in the past, there were also times where I had been leaving the office\nat 3:46AM or just working for 30 hours straight... Every time I had done this,\nI would have to pay back the extra time with 50% interest, in the form of\nphysical weakness and brain fog. It can be fun to test your limits like that,\nbut definitely not productive long-term in any way.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTo some people, working day and night might seem like dedication and\ndetermination, but in reality it's just poor planning and inadequate\nprioritization. It's only worth it if you have a tight and non-negotiable\ndeadline. Otherwise it's just counterproductive stress.\n\nThe better alternative is to summon the will to stop early, eat well, sleep\nwell, and sharpen your mind. Like a sharp knife, a sharp mind cuts through\nproblems effortlessly. Don't be cutting a beef steak with a butter knife.\n\nIf you're losing sleep over something, can you spread it over the next couple\nof days? Can you make a shortcut and do a simpler version of it? Actually, do\nyou want to do it at all? You will invest a part of your life that you will\nnever get back. Is it worth it?\n\n  * GitHub \u2022\n  * Twitter \u2022\n  * LinkedIn \u2022\n  * Instagram\n\nMonokai \u2193\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n", "frontpage": false}
