At this moment in time, there is one search\nengine \u2014 the rest are significantly insignificant. I can toot my horn all I\nwant about the alternatives, but the reality is that not everyone will pay for\nsearch, very few of these alternatives maintain their own index, and when you\nlook at my traffic, it\u2019s not even close. This matters because not only is\nGoogle the dominant search engine, it\u2019s also the owner of the only ad network\nwith statistical significance. This dynamic creates a perverse incentive, and\nhas taken a considerable toll on the web. Google is inherently incentivized to\npromote the most ad laden content, instead of the highest quality. Website\nadmins fill their sites with prose to give search engines more keywords to\nlatch onto, and to make more room for ads. Basically, what I\u2019m saying is that\nwebsites must choose between the quality of their content and the amount of\npeople it will reach.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be much of a reach to call the web uninhabitable in a post SEO\nworld. If you\u2019ve ever searched a recipe, you\u2019ll know what I\u2019m talking about.\nThe two richest companies, those two with their own search indexes, have\nrecognized this problem they created. To compensate for it, they quietly\ndownloaded all the text on the internet with no regard for copyright, and fed\nit into huge, glorified, energy consuming markov chains that we call LLMs.\nNow, they encourage you to feed your questions to it, instead of wading\nthrough all the shit they birthed. To users at this moment, this proposition\nis immensely popular. Simultaneously, while users jump ship from the web,\nwebsite administrators continue to be lazy with no regard for their best\ninterests. They also view LLMs as game changing. These products allow them to\npump out more shit, much faster. In this way, the vicious spiral begins.\n\nI\u2019m sure we all understand the most immediate problem hurtling at us. AI is\nliterally inbreeding as it continues to consume and produce. Researchers have\ncoined it \u201cModel Collapse\u201d, \u201cModel Autophagy Disorder\u201d and \u201cHabsburg AI\u201d. It\nall means the same thing. The loss of intelligence on the web is happening\nshockingly fast, and it\u2019s only accelerating. If you\u2019ve been on Reddit or\nTwitter in the past few months, the signs of bots chattering back and forth\nwith each other are unmistakable, while the platforms cheer it on and begin to\nsell it back to the AI.\n\nSo yeah, it\u2019s going to overwhelm humans sooner rather than later. Less obvious\nis the fact it\u2019s going to kill them. A vast amount of people still writing on\nthe web write their content with the hopes that others will read it. Some do\nit for a living. If the only people reading this content is AI, why on earth\nwould they write it? Why bother to put content on websites if said content\nwill just be regurgitated back in some twisted game of telephone? We are\nwatching as publications shutter their doors en-mass in wake of the death of\nsearch, and it\u2019s showing no signs of stopping. We\u2019ve watched Vice shutdown.\nLiterally 2.5 newspapers are ceasing operation a week. Clarkesworld stopped\naccepting new submissions due to being overwhelmed by AI. Bigger publishers\nhave begun replacing their writers with it.\n\nAnd what will be left, when there is no more data to train on? How can the AI\npossibly learn of new developments in our world without humans to leech off?\nJust as important, how can we possibly be expected to learn in a world utterly\ndevoid of opinions and contrasting viewpoints? AI is, by nature, the most\naverage content on the web, as the surviving human generated content pulls the\nmodel in both directions. In fact, it\u2019s not just the lack of opinions. It\u2019s\nthe complete suppression of them, as the largest companies work hard to cover\ntheir asses.\n\nStill, it\u2019s not quite over. When the internet breathes its last breath and all\nthat remains is a feed of information controlled by the two largest companies,\nwhat will remain is the rebels. The rebels are the spirit of the internet.\n\n## \ud83d\udd17 Outlinks\n\n  * Are We Watching The Internet Die?\n  * The Internet Is Full of AI Dogshit\n  * Twit: \u201cthe future is so beautiful\u201d\n  * AI is killing the old web, and the new web struggles to be born\n  * Did SEO experts ruin the internet or did Google?\n  * NYT: This Is How A.I.
