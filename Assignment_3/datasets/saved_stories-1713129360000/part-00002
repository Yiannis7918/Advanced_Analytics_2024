One thing\nthat has infamously stayed the same since that 2011 launch: Apple gives you\njust 5GB of iCloud storage for free.\n\nNearly 13 years later, how does iCloud\u2019s free storage offer \u2013 and paid upgrade\nplans \u2013 compare to the competition?\n\n## iCloud storage vs the competition\n\nMy research was inspired by John Gruber at Daring Fireball, who published his\ncall for Apple to \u201coffer more with iCloud, cost-to-Apple be damned\u201d last week.\n\nPrice| iCloud| Dropbox| Microsoft 365| Google  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nFree| 5GB| 2GB| 5GB cloud + 15GB email| 15GB  \n$0.99| 50GB| \u2013| \u2013| \u2013  \n$1.99| \u2013| \u2013| 100GB| 100GB  \n$2.99| 200GB| \u2013| \u2013| 200GB  \n$6.99| \u2013| \u2013| 1TB| \u2013  \n$9.99| 2TB| 2TB| \u2013| 2TB  \n$24.99| \u2013| \u2013| \u2013| 5TB  \n$29.99| 6TB| \u2013| \u2013| \u2013  \n$49.99| \u2013| \u2013| \u2013| 10TB  \n$59.99| 12TB| \u2013| \u2013| \u2013  \n  \nThere are other companies beyond these four that offer cloud storage. pCloud,\nfor instance, is an increasingly popular choice that offers both subscription\nand \u201clifetime\u201d storage options. For instance, you can get 2TB of storage from\npCloud for $99/year or $399 lifetime. I\u2019m not sure how sustainable that\nbusiness model is, but it\u2019s an interesting proposition.\n\n## But there\u2019s more to the story\n\nBut while it\u2019s easy to do a comparison based purely on storage amounts, there\nare other factors to consider \u2013 especially for Microsoft and Apple.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s 100GB plan also includes access to other features and services,\nincluding mobile and web versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and more. The\n1TB plan includes access to those services on the desktop, web, and mobile.\n\nMicrosoft doesn\u2019t offer a way to subscribe to just OneDrive storage. They used\nto, but they removed that option in 2023. You can, however, add up to 1TB of\nadditional storage to a Microsoft 365 plan at $0.01 per GB.\n\nAnother thing in Microsoft\u2019s favor: its free tier includes 5GB of cloud\nstorage and 15GB of mailbox storage. In Apple\u2019s case, you get 5GB for free,\nand everything (including iCloud Mail) counts toward that limit.\n\nApple\u2019s iCloud+ storage plans, meanwhile, include various other premium\nfeatures:\n\n  * iCloud Private Relay\n  * Hide My Email\n  * Custom Email Domain\n  * Extra HomeKit Secure Video cameras\n  * Family Sharing\n\n## 9to5Mac\u2019s Take\n\nDropbox and Google\u2019s plans also include some benefits beyond just storage, but\ndoes anyone really care?\n\nI generally found myself in agreement with Gruber\u2019s conclusion. Sure, Apple\u2019s\npricing and plans are competitive with its competitors. Even the free tier at\n5GB isn\u2019t significantly out of line compared to the broader market. Still,\nafter 13 years, something needs to change:\n\n> So on the one hand, it\u2019s not like Apple\u2019s iCloud storage pricing is out of\n> line with its competitors. But on the other hand, the free tier of iCloud\n> has been stuck at 5 GB since the day iCloud was announced, which was so long\n> ago that Steve Jobs announced it at his final WWDC keynote in 2011. iCloud\u2019s\n> $1/month 50 GB and $3/month 200 GB tiers have been unchanged since 2015.\n> Like the stingy U.S. minimum wage \u2014 which was last increased, to $7.25/hour,\n> in 2009 \u2014 these tiers ought to be adjusted for \u201cinflation\u201d periodically, but\n> aren\u2019t.\n\nAnother takeaway I had: all of this is confusing. Chances are, if you\u2019re an\niPhone user looking for more cloud storage, your best bet is iCloud+.\n\nCheck out Gruber\u2019s full write-up for more.\n\nFollow Chance: Threads, Twitter, Instagram, and Mastodon.\n\nAdd 9to5Mac to your Google News feed.\n\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.
