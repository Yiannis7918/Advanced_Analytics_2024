Tiny black holes, created seconds after the birth\nof the universe, may survive longer than expected, reigniting a suspicion that\nprimordial black holes could account for dark matter, the universe's most\nmysterious stuff.\n\nDark matter currently represents one of the most pressing problems in physics.\nThat is because, despite making up an estimated 85% of the matter in the\ncosmos, dark matter remains effectively invisible to our eyes because it\ndoesn't interact with light.\n\nBecause the particles that comprise atoms that compose \"everyday\" stuff we can\nsee, like stars, planets, and our own bodies, clearly do interact with light,\nthis has prompted the search for dark matter particles outside the Standard\nModel of particle physics. Many scientists believe the answer could still lie\nwithin the Standard Model, however, if we consider a diminutive cousin of\ncosmic objects we usually view as tremendously massive, and even monstrous:\nBlack holes.\n\nRelated: New view of the supermassive black hole at the heart of the Milky Way\nhints at an exciting hidden feature (image)\n\nMax Planck Institute scientist Valentin Thoss and Ana Fernandes Alexandre from\nthe University of Lisbon are two researchers who have recently been involved\nin such studies. They posit tiny black holes born over 13.8 billion years ago,\njust after the Big Bang, that are no larger than a proton, could cluster to\nbecome suspects for dark matter without the need for new physics.\n\nNot only has a recent change in thinking regarding how black holes \"evaporate\"\nprompted a reassessment of primordial black holes' viability as dark matter\nsuspects, but as the search for a dark matter particle continues to mostly\ndraw a blank, more researchers could begin to look at the primordial black\nhole dark matter theory more seriously.\n\n## What are primordial black holes?\n\n\"As the name suggests, 'primordial black holes' are a type of black hole that\nis formed at the beginning of the universe,\" Thoss told Space.com. \"Within the\nfirst fraction of a second of the universe, in fact.\"\n\n## Get the Space.com Newsletter\n\nBreaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events\nand more!\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nHe explained that all the structures we observe in the universe, from\nsuperclusters of galaxies to the galaxies within themselves, are formed from\nslight overdensities in space present during the early universe. If the early\nuniverse experienced much stronger density fluctuations than the those which\ncreated these features, and these fluctuations collapsed at an earlier time\nthan galaxies indeed formed, then those overly dense patches could have\nspurred primordial black holes.\n\nThoss added that, depending on the time at which this collapse may have\nhappened as well as the scale of the collapse, these primordial black holes\nwould have very different masses. The primordial black holes that Thoss and\nFernandes Alexandre considered possible dark matter candidates would have\nmasses ranging between a few tons and a thousand tons, to be specific, which\nis less than the mass of a planet and more in the category of a small\nasteroid.\n\nA diagram showing the expansion history of the universe. Primordial black\nholes would have emerged from density fluctuations prior to the first stars.\n(Image credit: NASA/WMAP Science Team/Art by Dana Berry)\n\nConsidering how the smallest black holes scientists have discovered to date,\nknown as stellar-mass black holes, have masses equivalent to between 3 and 50\ntimes that of the sun \u2014 which itself is 2.2 times 10 to the power of 27 (22\nfollowed by 26 zeroes) tons \u2014 these primordial black holes are incredibly\ntiny.\n\nLike their larger black hole counterparts formed from either the collapse of\nmassive stars or the merger of relatively smaller black holes, according to\nFernandes Alexandre, primordial black holes would have a light-trapping outer\nboundary called an event horizon. The diameter of this horizon is determined\nby the mass of the black hole, which means the event horizon would be\nincredibly small in those cases. \"Smaller than the radius of a proton,\"\nFernandes Alexandre said.\n\nThe anatomy of a black hole. No matter the size, all black holes have event\nhorizons. (Image credit: ESO)\n\nSmall, primordial black holes had previously been ruled out as dark matter\ncandidates because all black holes are thought to \"leak\" a type of thermal\nradiation first theorized by Stephen Hawking in 1974 and later named \"Hawking\nradiation.\"\n\nThe smaller a black hole, the more rapidly it should leak Hawking radiation\nand, thus, the faster it should evaporate. That means if primordial black\nholes ever existed, the smallest examples shouldn't be around today \u2014 yet,\ndark matter clearly is.\n\n\"Primordial black holes with the masses Ana and I are now considering had been\nessentially previously considered ruled out because they were assumed to have\nevaporated fully by this time in the universe,\" Thoss said.\n\nRecent work by Giorgi Dvali, a theoretical physicist at the University of\nMunich who has collaborated with Thoss and Fernandes Alexandre, has suggested\nthat the evaporation process breaks down at a certain point, however. This\nmeans primordial black holes of the masses the scientists considered could\nachieve a semi-stable state.\n\n\"In order to decrease its mass through the emission of Hawking radiation, the\nblack hole has to 'rewrite' its information, or something else. This rewriting\nprocess takes time,\" Fernandes Alexandre explained. \"It is called 'memory\nburden' because of this memory that now has to be passed along to something\nelse, and that just kind of slows down the evaporation process overall. So\nit's a kind of stabilization.\"\n\nAnd that \"rescue mechanism\" means primordial black holes are back as\npotentially dark matter candidates!\n\n## A dead ringer for dark matter?\n\nThe fact that primordial black holes could exist in the universe today,\nhowever, doesn't immediately mean they should be considered dark matter\nsuspects. As it happens, there are other reasons to link these tiny\nhypothetical black holes to the universe's mysterious matter content.\n\nPerhaps the most obvious connection is dark matter's lack of interaction with\nlight. Dark matter doesn't emit or reflect light, and the event horizon that\nbounds all black holes represents the point at which the escape velocity\nnecessary to cross it exceeds the speed of light. That means primordial black\nholes would \"trap\" all incident light, resulting in an apparent lack of\ninteractions.\n\n\"If they are light enough, somewhere around a planetary mass, primordial black\nholes behave like particles of dark matter for all purposes that we are\ninterested in,\" Thoss said. \"Dark matter is 'collision-less' in standard\nmodels, so dark matter particles do not interact with each other to such a\ndegree that it affects the universe.\"\n\nHe added that if primordial black holes are lighter than planetary masses,\nthen, even on cosmic timescales, they would be so small they'd very rarely\ncollide. These primordial black holes could rather cluster to create the\ngravitational effects we currently attribute to dark matter, such as providing\nthe gravitational influence that prevents rapidly spinning galaxies from\nflying apart.\n\nAn illustration of a cloud of dark matter, could this actually be a cluster of\nblack holes? (Image credit: X-ray: NASA/CXC/CfA/M.Markevitch et al.; Optical:\nNASA/STScI; Magellan/U.Arizona/D.Clowe et al.; Lensing Map: NASA/STScI; ESO\nWFI; Magellan/U.Arizona/D.Clowe et al.)\n\nYet, if primordial black holes have to cluster to account for the effects of\ndark matter, what would prevent these black holes from drawing together and\nmerging to create larger black holes? Wouldn't a cluster of tiny black holes\neventually just become one tremendous black hole? Thoss said this has been\ninvestigated, and the answer is simply: \"No.\"\n\n\"Even if you take into account clustering, the time scales for the merger are\nso long that they would only merge into really massive black holes over the\nentire age of the universe,\" he continued.\n\nThoss added that the beauty of using primordial black holes as an explanation\nfor dark matter is that, unlike suggesting a hypothetical particle such as an\naxion to explain the mystery, primordial black holes don't require an\nextension to the Standard Model of particle physics, the best explanation we\nhave of the universe on subatomic scales.\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\n\u2014 Dark matter detected dangling from the cosmic web for 1st time\n\n\u2014 How the Large Hadron Collider's successor will hunt for the dark universe\n\n\u2014 Massive galaxy with no dark matter is a cosmic puzzle\n\nStill, primordial black holes are going to be incredibly difficult to confirm\nas dark matter, if they really do explain the phenomenon. Again, their light-\ntrapping nature means they are effectively invisible. Plus, at such diminutive\nsizes, they don't have the same immense gravitational effects as their stellar\nand supermassive brethren.\n\nEven then, should a cluster of primordial black holes be detected, there is no\nreal way to tell the difference between lots of little black holes and one\nlarge black hole.\n\nDespite this difficulty, Thoss and Fernandes Alexandre intend to stay hot on\nthe tail of primordial black holes \u2014 theoretically, at least. If particle\ncandidates for dark matter continue to fail to manifest, perhaps the answer is\nto get more physicists to start looking over the metaphorical fence between\nparticle physics and cosmology.\n\n\"I wouldn't say that primordial black holes were ever dismissed as dark matter\ncandidates; they were ignored for a while though,\" Fernandes Alexandre said.\n\"Now, lined up with the fact that we don't really have any detection of\nparticle dark matter, I think it just becomes more and more relevant to\nconsider this option.\"\n\nJoin our Space Forums to keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky\nand more!
