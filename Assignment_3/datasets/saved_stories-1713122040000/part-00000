Isaac\nMcCurdy and his platoon of infantry troops, playing a fictional enemy of the\nUnited States, found themselves up against a very different kind of foe: one\nwith camera lenses for eyes and sheet metal for skin.\n\nThese weren\u2019t your average flesh-and-blood men that they were fighting. They\nwere machines.\n\nDriving on eight screeching wheels and carrying enough firepower on their\ntruck beds to fill a small arms depot, a handful of U.S. Army robots stormed\nthrough the battlefield of the fictional city of Ujen.\n\nThe robots shot up houses where the opposition force hid. Drones that had been\nloitering over the battlefield for hours hovered above McCurdy and his team\nand dropped \u201cbombs\u201d\u2014foam footballs, in this case\u2014right on top of them, a\nperfectly placed artillery shot. Robot dogs, with sensors for heads, searched\nhouses to make sure they were clear.\n\n\u201cIf you see the whites of someone\u2019s eyes or their sunglasses, [and] you shoot\nback at that, they\u2019re going to have a human response,\u201d McCurdy said. \u201cIf it\u2019s\na robot pulling up, shooting something that\u2019s bigger than you can carry\nyourself, and it\u2019s not going to just die when you shoot a center mass, it\u2019s a\nvery different feeling.\u201d\n\nA robotic dog moves across a sandy desert landscape through the purple smoke\nof a flare. Solders holding guns crouch behind the four-legged robot, taking\nshelter against a wall.\n\nA Ghost Robotic Dog moves forward with U.S. soldiers behind it during an\nexercise at Fort Irwin on March 17Spc. Samarion Hicks/U.S. Army\n\nThe Army\u2019s top officer, Gen. Randy George, made the trip from the Pentagon to\nwatch the fictitious battle. Standing on the rooftop of a makeshift stucco\nbuilding that swayed from the tank rounds thudding against the desert sand, he\nwas flanked by a half-dozen top generals and about as many colonels. Many of\nthem wore metal wristbands engraved with the names of the soldiers who died\nunder their commands in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nIn the United States\u2019 next major war, the Army\u2019s brass is hoping that robots\nwill be the ones taking the first punch, doing the dirty, dull, and dangerous\njobs that killed hundreds\u2014likely thousands\u2014of the more than 7,000 U.S. service\nmembers who died during two decades of wars in the Middle East. The goal is to\nput a robot in the most dangerous spot on the battlefield instead of a\n19-year-old private fresh out of basic training.\n\nNot all of these machines are ready for prime time, though. During the Fort\nIrwin exercise, dubbed \u201cProject Convergence\u201d\u2014which was designed to test robots\nin realistic combat scenarios\u2014they didn\u2019t face live bullets. The robots don\u2019t\nhave peripheral vision; they can\u2019t look left or look right like a human\nsoldier can by simply turning their head. And the Army\u2019s outdated network\ncan\u2019t always keep hundreds of drones aloft at the same time, or even tell U.S.\ntroops which of the unpiloted aircraft are friend or foe.\n\nBut they\u2019ve come a long way. George and other Army leaders believe that almost\nevery U.S. Army unit, down to the smallest foot patrols, will soon have drones\nin the sky to sense, protect, and attack. And it won\u2019t be long before the\nUnited States is deploying ground robots into battle in human-machine teams.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just one robot [that] replaces one human,\u201d said Alex Miller,\nGeorge\u2019s chief technology officer. The question, he said, is how the Army can\nput robots on the front line \u201cwithout taking a single rifleman, or multiple\nriflemen, off the line to control a robot.\u201d\n\nA pile of boulders in a desert landscape are painted all over with U.S. Army\nlogos in various colors. A blue sky and a few small white clouds are visible\noverhead.\n\nU.S. Army Futures Command and Project Convergence logos are painted alongside\nvarious insignias on rocks outside the gates of the National Training Center\nat Fort Irwin, seen on March 20.Spc. Marquis McCants/U.S. Army\n\nYou could be forgiven if you didn\u2019t know there was a U.S. Army training base\nnearly the size of Rhode Island in the middle of the California desert. After\nall, Fort Irwin isn\u2019t easy to get to.\n\nPull off Interstate 15, go through the city of Barstow, and drive another 23\nor so miles. You\u2019ll see a big pile of rocks\u2014boulders of basalt formed millions\nof years ago when an ancient volcano erupted\u2014painted with Army insignias.\nYou\u2019ll see the red and blue shield of the 197th Infantry Brigade and the black\nand yellow Norman shield and horse silhouette of the 1st Cavalry Division.\nEvery logo symbolizes a different Army unit that has trained here\u2014about 10\nevery year. That\u2019s how you know you\u2019re at Fort Irwin.\n\nThe isolation is the point. Soldiers call the massive training range \u201cthe\nbox.\u201d That\u2019s because it\u2019s basically a sandbox for military exercises, one of\nthe only places in the continental United States where you can jam the\nelectromagnetic spectrum, fly drones at 30,000 feet, and fire large munitions\nwithout bothering anybody. Fort Irwin contains 14 fictional cities and 1,200\nbuildings. Once troops arrive, they\u2019re here for 21 days\u2014with no showers.\n\nLife in the desert is hard. In a January exercise, U.S. Army troops had to\nbrave wind, rain, sleet, snow, and oppressive heat, sometimes all in one day.\nThere are about 1,200 fake casualties for every three-week rotation. Service\nmembers in one of the brigades that deployed here for that mock battle with\nthe 1st Armored Division had to carry their artillery with them 40 miles into\nbattle.\n\nSoldiers in combat gear run across a dusty street with their guns drawn in\nfront of the simple concrete buildings of a fake city used for training.\nTelephone wires and clouds are visible overhead.\n\nSoldiers conduct an urban assault drill in the training grounds at Fort Irwin\non March 18. Sgt. Maxwell Bass/U.S. Army\n\nIt\u2019s like a giant game of laser tag, with the intensity turned up. Almost\neveryone who fights in the simulation dies in the simulation at one\npoint\u2014sometimes with pools of fake blood and prosthetic gore that looks real\nenough to fool an untrained eye. Even George has died in the simulation more\ntimes than he\u2019d like to admit.\n\nThe scenarios are written to fit wherever U.S. troops are deploying, which for\nthe past two decades has mostly been Iraq and Afghanistan. But since 2014,\naround the time of the Kremlin\u2019s first invasion of Ukraine, the Army has used\nFort Irwin to practice large-scale combat operations against enemy forces\nmodeled after China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army and the Russian military.\n\nThe idea is for the Army to do most of its bleeding in training, not on the\nbattlefield. So organizers try to make the simulated enemy tougher than the\nreal one\u2014not like the Russians, who stumbled into Ukraine with maps from the\n1980s looking for towns that didn\u2019t exist. The fighting that Ukrainian troops\nhave experienced on the battlefield\u2014inside Mariupol\u2019s Azovstal steel plant,\naround the city of Kharkiv, and during the liberation of Kherson\u2014has forced\nthe Army to adapt even further.\n\n\u201cOriginally, we had units actually knocking on doors because that\u2019s what they\nlearned in Iraq and Afghanistan,\u201d said Maj. Gen. Curt Taylor, the commander of\nthe national training center. \u201cThat\u2019s going to get you killed.\u201d And more often\nthan not, soldiers have to hold their (simulated) fire. There are paid actors\nroaming around Irwin playing civilians caught in the crossfire.\n\nAn 8-wheeled unmanned vehicle with a gun on the front moves across a sandy\nstreet as soldiers in combat gear watch.\n\nAn unmanned transport vehicle with a remote weapon system provides support to\nsoldiers in an urban environment as part of a training exercise at Fort Irwin\non March 12. Spc. Samarion Hicks/U.S. Army\n\nThe scenarios are also starting to include robots. Today, the Army might have\nthree platoons deployed in a basic attack, McCurdy said: one to fix the enemy\nin place, another to maneuver on them, and then one more in reserve. Put\nrobots into that group of soldiers, and they suddenly have much more room to\nmaneuver.\n\n\u201cThen you have basically three platoons entirely freed up,\u201d McCurdy said. \u201cAnd\nit also draws far more enemy attention to those harder targets of the robots.\nIt protects you, frees you up, gives you more flexibility, and weakens up all\nother fronts of the enemy\u2019s defenses.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not 100 percent sure how they would work against it,\u201d said Sgt. Philip\nWebb, the weapons squad leader for the opposing force in the exercise.\n\nThat might not be true on every battlefield. Like everything here, Project\nConvergence is an experiment. It\u2019s hard to stop a robot from rolling along\nFort Irwin\u2019s sand and volcanic rock, which has plenty of traction for the\nArmy\u2019s Small Multipurpose Equipment Transports to move freely across. And\nsoldiers haven\u2019t shot any real live ammunition at the robots\u2014yet. A well-\nplaced shot to the sensor might render a ground robot functionally useless.\nAnd robots might turn into expensive icicles at the British military\u2019s largest\ntraining ground in the hostile winters of the Canadian province of Alberta.\n\nRead More\n\nSoldiers from the 13th Counterintelligence Battalion, 2nd Reconnaissance\nPlatoon, of the Swedish Armed Forces participate in military exercise in\nKungsangen, Sweden, on Feb. 27.Soldiers from the 13th Counterintelligence\nBattalion, 2nd Reconnaissance Platoon, of the Swedish Armed Forces participate\nin military exercise in Kungsangen, Sweden, on Feb. 27.\n\n### Sweden\u2019s New Model Army\n\nNATO\u2019s newest member has a military conscription system that other countries\ncan learn from.\n\nAnalysis\n\n|\n\nGil Barndollar\n\nThe silhouette of a drone operator in UkraineThe silhouette of a drone\noperator in Ukraine\n\n### How an Army of Drones Changed the Battlefield in Ukraine\n\nEver-present surveillance has made movement extremely difficult, but there are\nstill ways to evade detection.\n\nAnalysis\n\n|\n\nFranz-Stefan Gady\n\nA collage photo illustration with Putin behind a blue background, the NATO\nlogo like a crosshair overlay, with soldiers and warplanes in the foreground.A\ncollage photo illustration with Putin behind a blue background, the NATO logo\nlike a crosshair overlay, with soldiers and warplanes in the foreground.\n\n### NATO\u2019s Military Has a New Nerve Center\n\nThe alliance has transformed its once sleepy headquarters into a war command\nfocused on Russia.\n\nFeature\n\n|\n\nJack Detsch\n\nDrones are already ubiquitous\u2014you can buy a quadcopter off the shelf for about\n$50 at most big-box stores\u2014but building ground robots that can see and sense\ntheir way through modern battlefields is much harder.\n\nBut the entire field of military robotics is speeding up. Ukraine has already\npledged to create a separate service branch for drones and unmanned vehicles.\nThe U.S. Army might not be too far off: It\u2019s considering a proposal to add a\nplatoon of robots, the equivalent of 20 to 50 human soldiers, to its armored\nbrigade combat teams, which are the service\u2019s bread-and-butter, tank-backed\ninfantry units.\n\nArmy officials don\u2019t think that robots will replace humans\u2014or that they will\ndo much to solve the problem of recruiting shortfalls\u2014but they\u2019re working on\nthe math to get the ratio of humans to robots to about 2-to-1 or 3-to-1.\n\nThe point is to get the advantage before China or Russia do.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want it to be even,\u201d said Lt. Gen. John Morrison, the principal\nadvisor to the Army\u2019s chief of staff for network and cybersecurity. \u201cWe want\nit to be a technical overmatch.\u201d\n\nA soldier in combat gear looks up as a small drone flies above him in front of\na pile of rocks in a desert landscape. Another soldiers kneels in front of a\nmassive pile of boulders a few yards away.\n\nSoldiers use experimental drone technology in a training assault as a part of\nProject Convergence at Fort Irwin on Oct. 27, 2022. Spc. Jaaron Tolley/U.S.\nArmy\n\nIf the Russia-Ukraine war has taught the Army anything about the future of\nwarfare, it\u2019s to look up. Soldiers are listening for drones and coming up with\nbattle drills to defend against them. If something can be seen or sensed, it\ncan be killed.\n\nTo survive on the modern battlefield, soldiers are having to make themselves\nsmaller and smaller\u2014almost invisible. Loitering munitions can wait over the\nbattlefield for hours, ready to dive if an operator senses the faintest\ntwitch. Fort Irwin\u2019s mock enemy troops have 105 drone swarms and can attack\nwith dozens to hundreds of the small unmanned planes at a time.\n\nUnwieldy server stacks and satellite dishes sticking out of U.S. vehicles and\noutposts could get soldiers killed. And U.S. troops will probably have to turn\noff their iPhones and Androids, which are rippling through the electromagnetic\nspectrum.\n\n\u201cThe cell phone is the new cigarette in the foxhole,\u201d said Taylor, the\ntraining center commander. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown soldiers, \u2018hey, your cell phone can\nget you killed.\u2019\u201d Taylor and his team recently spotted an otherwise\nundetectable Apache helicopter weaving through their air defenses when they\nclocked the pilot\u2019s iPhone doing 120 miles per hour across the desert.\n\nWar is moving at the speed of technology\u2014light-years. But the U.S. Army moves\nat the speed of budget\u2014fiscal years. That\u2019s not going to work when a home-\nbuilt quadcopter can drop a grenade and destroy a fighter jet parked on the\nground. And the Defense Department is on the wrong side of the cost equation.\n\n\u201cWhat keeps me up is the cost imposition factor that robotics systems bring,\u201d\nsaid Miller, the chief technology officer. \u201cA $1,500 drone can take out a\nmultimillion-dollar aircraft.\u201d\n\nA U.S. Army general in camouflage wears an augmented reality headset over his\neyes and holds a controller. Standing around him are reporters and other\nsoldiers.\n\nGen. Randy George tests new augmented reality technology during an event at\nFort Irwin on March 18.Sgt. Maxwell Bass/U.S. Army\n\nGeorge has only been on the job for six months, but he has already taken a\nscalpel to the Army\u2019s weapons programs. The Army canceled the RQ-11 Raven and\nRQ-7 Shadow drone programs, which took nearly a decade to produce and earned\nthe nickname \u201cflying lawnmower\u201d from troops miffed by their slow speed. Crash\njust one and it might cost the Army a million dollars\u2014enough to pay about a\nplatoon\u2019s worth of Army privates their full year\u2019s wages.\n\nBut building up is difficult, and China is poised at virtually every part of\nthe drone and robotics supply chain. And Project Convergence is still just an\nexperiment; the Army hasn\u2019t been able to get most of this new technology into\nthe budget\u2014it\u2019s mostly on the list of unfunded priorities that George is\nasking Congress to add to its almost $186 billion budget request. That\u2019s too\nslow. In the next war, the Army is going to need to reprogram things\ninstantly.\n\nWith drones becoming all the rage, the Army has also canceled the big-ticket\nFuture Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft program\u2014which was developing a next-\ngeneration scout helicopter\u2014and service leaders want to end production of one\nvariant of Blackhawk helicopters. It\u2019s still an open question whether the Army\nhas the authority to buy and build cheap off-the-shelf drones like the\nUkrainians, though. George is seeking the acquisition authority to do so, but\nthe defense industry doesn\u2019t love the idea of the Army being a less\npredictable weapons buyer; many companies want the stability of multiyear\ncontracts.\n\nThe next target for belt-tightening is the ponderous Distributed Common Ground\nSystem, the Army\u2019s most widely used intelligence sharing platform: stacks of\nservers that resemble discarded record players with messes of wires extending\nfrom them, many of which have had to be updated by hand.\n\nMembers of the brass say that they\u2019re listening to the rank and file\u2019s demands\nto throw out the old junk. \u201cWhen someone says something is a piece of crap,\nthat bothers me,\u201d George said.\n\nInstead, troops want to be running their missions from tablets and iPhones.\nMaj. Gen. Jim Isenhower, who leads the Army\u2019s 1st Armored Division, told\nGeorge during a demonstration that he believes putting command-and-control\nsystems onto screens, tablets, and mixed reality applications can help him\nreduce the size of a combat outpost by 95 percent, from 326 troops to about\neight\u2014so small that the Army\u2019s opposition force didn\u2019t even spot it during\npractice drills.\n\nCalling out orders from a tablet can make the Army move faster, too. Before,\nU.S. Army intelligence analysts were looking at radar and signals intercepts\nthrough a soda straw, trying to find the right line of data to see what\nweapons the enemy had and where they were. Now, with one radar pass, U.S.\ntroops can start to map out a Russian and Chinese unit and what kinds of guns\nthat unit has in its arsenal, with artificial intelligence helping to find the\nsignal in the noise.\n\nThe goal is to reduce the speed of targeting decisions to minutes and seconds\nin order to compete with enemies who are equally fast, if not faster.\n\n\u201cYou defend against the first wave, great,\u201d said Col. Scott Shaw, the director\nof the Army\u2019s maneuver capabilities development and integration directorate.\n\u201cWhat about the 12th wave? And what if the 12th wave comes in the 12th\nminute?\u201d\n\nTwo soldiers stand and one lays on the ground, all in combat gear, with guns\ndrawn, as they navigate a street corner on a simulated streetscape during a\ntraining drill in the desert.\n\nU.S. Army paratroopers observe their surroundings during an urban terrain\ndrill at Fort Irwin on March 11.Sgt. Maxwell Bass/U.S. Army\n\nPlumes of smoke drifted off the desert sand and the robot\u2019s gun barrels. The\nSMET vehicles that had stormed through Ujen had wheeled into position and\nfired Javelin shots into the caldera, the valley\u2019s cauldron-like floor.\n\nIn their wake, mine-clearing robots rushed out and fired a 350-foot rope line\nfull of explosive charge, more than 1,500 pounds of C-4 explosives spooled in\na tube.\n\n\u201cFive. Four. Three. Two. One,\u201d Shaw said, counting down as he waited for the\ncharge to detonate.\n\nIt didn\u2019t go off. So Shaw counted down from five again. Again, there was no\nexplosion.\n\nThe faulty line charge was one of the few things that went visibly wrong\nduring the exercise. In another instance, Army officials jammed themselves,\nand a swarm of drones dropped out of the sky. If soldiers were to make these\nkinds of mistakes on a real battlefield today, actual human beings could get\nkilled.\n\n\u201cI would not want to put a human into that,\u201d said Taylor, Fort Irwin\u2019s\ncommander, who has watched videos of Ukrainian troops trying to clear Russian\nminefields with the same U.S.-made explosives, working under a hail of\ngunfire.\n\nRobots may be harder to kill, but you can\u2019t fix stupid, either. \u201cThey don\u2019t\nhave curiosity\u2014they don\u2019t have instincts,\u201d said Gen. Jim Rainey, the head of\nU.S. Army Futures Command.\n\nAn unmanned vehicle assisted by soldiers in combat gear is loaded with human-\nsized dolls used to represent fake casualties during a drill. Another vehicle\nis at right with low buildings behind.\n\nAn unmanned military transport vehicle deploys for a simulated casualty\nevacuation during an exercise at Fort Irwin on March 16. Spc. Marquis\nMcCants/U.S. Army\n\nBut the idea of creating robots that do have curiosity and instincts is also\nterrifying. Are military officials worried about creating terminators?\n\nGeorge, the Army chief, said that he\u2019s not. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about completely\nautonomous vehicles,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything out there was controlled by a\nsoldier.\u201d\n\nExperts acknowledge that the robots of the future may need two sets of rules:\none for peacetime, and another for war. With Russian troops invading their\ncountry, the Ukrainian military doesn\u2019t care very much about safety features\nsuch as kill switches, which would force a robot to cease all operations if it\ngets a command that\u2019s not signed with the encryption codes of the right\ncontroller.\n\nThe United Nations, on the other hand, cares a lot about such things. The U.N.\nGeneral Assembly\u2019s First Committee approved a draft resolution on autonomous\nweapons in November, declaring that a human should always be in the loop.\n\n\u201cThe law of warfare is how we\u2019re going to apply robotic systems,\u201d said Miller,\nGeorge\u2019s chief technology officer.\n\nBut scientists are still at the ground level of building out the field of\nrobotics, just like the Stanford University professors who built the network\nprotocols that led to the internet. \u201cThey didn\u2019t envision the internet, so\nthey didn\u2019t envision all the ways that people could abuse the internet,\u201d said\nMiller.\n\n\u201cThe scariest circumstance is not Skynet,\u201d Miller added, referring to the\nsuper-intelligent network of killer robots from the Terminator movies as he\nheld a cellphone with an app tracking the positions of soldiers and robots at\nFort Irwin. \u201cThe scariest circumstance is that it comes under the enemy\u2019s\ncontrol.\u201d\n\nMy FP: Follow topics and authors to get straight to what you like.
