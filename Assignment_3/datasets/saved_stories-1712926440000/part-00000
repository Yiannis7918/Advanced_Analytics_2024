This article considers how\nyou should respond.\n\n#### Probably a scam\n\nThe majority of emails and almost all messages purporting to be from Apple are\nscams. Some of them are more obvious, others may at first appear quite\nconvincing, but ultimately there\u2019s something about all of them that doesn\u2019t\nring true.\n\nLate last year there was a spate of emails, not iMessage messages, warning\nusers about problems with iCloud, in particular that their allocation was\nalmost full and needed to be cleared out. Some of those at least came from\nwhat appeared to be a legitimate Apple email address, although it wasn\u2019t one\nnormally used to contact customers in this way. No one seems to know who sent\nthem, or why, but these appear to have been automated messages sent in error.\n\nThe great majority of Apple\u2019s official emails are sent from\nno_reply@email.apple.com, and a careful look through the text source and\nmessage headers should make it clear that other messages are forged, in which\ncase you should delete them.\n\nIf you can\u2019t see anything wrong to suggest the message isn\u2019t genuine, verify\nits contents using an independent method. For example, if it claims that your\niCloud allowance is almost used up, don\u2019t click on any links in the message,\nbut log into your iCloud account through iCloud.com.\n\nThere, click on your account in the tile at the upper left. If there might be\na problem over storage in iCloud Drive, then click on Storage there to view\nhow your space is being used, and how much remains free. You can also check\nyour Apple ID settings and more, to verify the reason for someone sending you\nan email in the first place. If what you see on iCloud.com doesn\u2019t tally with\nwhat they claim, then you know that it\u2019s a scam or error.\n\n#### Phishing\n\nIf the email or message refers to anything about security or malicious\nsoftware, then it\u2019s almost certainly a phishing attack. Don\u2019t even think about\nclicking on any links provided, and, if in Messages, forward that message to\nApple\u2019s scam and phishing team. Apple provides full instructions and addresses\nin this article.\n\nOne of the best ways to scan for phishing attacks is to read your email\nmessages in source. Although this feature is hidden away in Mail, access it\nusing View > Message > Raw Source. Other mail clients may give the option to\nview the body of all messages as text, making this even easier, as you can\nimmediately see the true destination of each of its links. That\u2019s one reason\nthat I use Postbox as my preferred email client.\n\n#### Malware reports\n\nWith one notable exception, Apple doesn\u2019t know whether your Mac or devices\nhave any malware, and can\u2019t tell you if they do. Any message that tries to\ntell you otherwise is phishing or scam. macOS now has three built-in systems\nthat check for malware:\n\n  * XProtect, which checks executable code when it\u2019s being loaded to run, particularly if it has a quarantine flag and hasn\u2019t yet been run on that Mac. If that picks up anything, it reports this to you in an alert, telling you to delete that app or file, and blocks you from running it. It doesn\u2019t phone home to Apple.\n  * XProtect Remediator runs on macOS Catalina and later, and every 24 hours or so makes a series of scans to check for known malware. It doesn\u2019t send its reports to Apple, but records them in the log, and they can be read by some security software. Check its latest reports using my free XProCheck.\n  * XProtect\u2019s latest Behavioural detection system, or Bastion, currently only seems to record rule violations in its local database, and it isn\u2019t believed to send any reports to Apple.\n\n#### Apple threat notifications\n\nThe one exception to these general rules is if you receive a threat\nnotification from Apple, as explained here. These consist of an email and\niMessage notification to the email addresses and phone numbers associated with\nyour Apple ID. Each provides advice as to what additional measures you can\ntake in response, but will never ask you to click any links, open files,\ninstall apps or profiles, or provide your Apple ID password or verification\ncode by email or over the phone.\n\nInstead, if you think you have received a threat notification from Apple, sign\nin to iCloud.com, where you should see confirmation that those messages are\ngenuine.\n\nThis is a new scheme Apple has started recently, for those users for whom\nApple has reason to believe are being targeted by \u201cmercenary spyware\u201d produced\nby well-funded groups like NSO. Apple has, apparently, already sent\nnotifications to users nearly 100 countries warning them of the threat to\ntheir Macs and devices. These are targeted attacks on individuals who may\nalready be under surveillance as journalists, activists, or similar.\n\n#### Summary\n\nIf you receive emails sent to the addresses known to Apple, and messages to\nMessages, notifying you of a threat against you, confirm this in iCloud.com\nand follow the advice given. Otherwise, it\u2019s most likely to be a scam or\nphishing attack.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * Reddit\n  * Pinterest\n  * Email\n  * Print\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### Related\n\nHow to report phishing to AppleAugust 13, 2015In \"Macs\"\n\nScammed and scarred: a cautionary taleMay 1, 2015In \"General\"\n\nIs Apple\u2019s Malware Removal Tool dropping out of macOS 13?June 3, 2022In \"Macs\"\n\nPosted in Macs, Technology and tagged Apple, malware, phishing, privacy, scam,\nsecurity.
