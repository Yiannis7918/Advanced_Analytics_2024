The police, the Royal Ulster\nConstabulary (RUC), were overwhelmingly Protestant and known for sectarianism\nand police brutality. The campaign was also violently opposed by Ulster\nloyalists, who believed it was a front for republican political activity.\nIncreasing tensions led to the August 1969 riots and the deployment of British\ntroops, in what became the British Army's longest operation.^[37] \"Peace\nwalls\" were built in some areas to keep the two communities apart. Some\nCatholics initially welcomed the British Army as a more neutral force than the\nRUC, but soon came to see it as hostile and biased, particularly after Bloody\nSunday in 1972.^[38]\n\nThe main participants in the Troubles were republican paramilitaries such as\nthe Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) and the Irish National Liberation\nArmy (INLA); loyalist paramilitaries such as the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF)\nand Ulster Defence Association (UDA); British state security forces such as\nthe British Army and RUC; and political activists. The security forces of the\nRepublic of Ireland played a smaller role. Republicans carried out a guerrilla\ncampaign against British forces as well as a bombing campaign against\ninfrastructural, commercial, and political targets. Loyalists attacked\nrepublicans/nationalists and the wider Catholic community in what they\ndescribed as retaliation. At times, there were bouts of sectarian tit-for-tat\nviolence, as well as feuds within and between paramilitary groups. The British\nsecurity forces undertook policing and counterinsurgency, primarily against\nrepublicans. There were incidents of collusion between British state forces\nand loyalist paramilitaries (see Stevens Inquiries). The Troubles also\ninvolved numerous riots, mass protests, and acts of civil disobedience, and\nled to increased segregation and the creation of temporary no-go areas.\n\nMore than 3,500 people were killed in the conflict, of whom 52% were\ncivilians, 32% were members of the British security forces, and 16% were\nmembers of paramilitary groups.^[9] Republican paramilitaries were responsible\nfor some 60% of the deaths, loyalists 30%, and security forces 10%.^[39] The\nNorthern Ireland peace process led to paramilitary ceasefires and talks\nbetween the main political parties, which resulted in the Good Friday\nAgreement of 1998. This Agreement restored self-government to Northern Ireland\non the basis of \"power-sharing\" and it included acceptance of the principle of\nconsent, commitment to civil and political rights, parity of esteem, police\nreform, paramilitary disarmament and early release of paramilitary prisoners.\nThere has been sporadic violence since the Agreement, including punishment\nattacks,^[40] loyalist gangs' control of major organised crime rackets (e.g.,\ndrugs supply, community coercion and violence,\nintimidation),^[41]^[42]^[43]^[44]^[45]^[46] and violent crime linked to\ndissident republican groups.^[4]^[30]^[47]\n\n## Name\n\nThe word \"troubles\" has been used as a synonym for violent conflict for\ncenturies. It was used to describe the 17th-century Wars of the Three Kingdoms\nby all three national parliaments. For example, after the Restoration in 1660,\nthe English Act of free and general pardon, indemnity and oblivion starts with\n\"The King's most excellent Majesty, taking into his gracious and serious\nconsideration the long and great troubles ...\"; as does the similar act in\nScotland: \"The king's most excellent majesty, considering that by the late\ntroubles diverse of his subjects ...\" (Scottish Parliament 1662); and by the\nIrish Parliament in the Act of Explanation (1665) \"our royal father of blessed\nmemory had been forced, during the late troubles, to make with the Irish\nsubjects of that our kingdom\" (Irish Parliament 1665, \u00a7 2). The term was used\nto describe the Irish revolutionary period in the early twentieth\ncentury.^[48] It was subsequently adopted to refer to the escalating violence\nin Northern Ireland after 1969.^[49]^[50]^[51]^[52]\n\n## Background\n\n### 1609\u20131791\n\nThe Battle of the Boyne (12 July 1690) by Jan van Huchtenburg\n\nIn 1609, Scottish and English settlers, known as planters, were given land\nescheated from the native Irish in the Plantation of Ulster.^[53] Coupled with\nProtestant immigration to \"unplanted\" areas of Ulster, particularly Antrim and\nDown, this resulted in conflict between the native Catholics and the\n\"planters\", leading in turn to two bloody religious conflicts known as the\nIrish Confederate Wars (1641\u20131653) and the Williamite war (1689\u20131691), both of\nwhich resulted in Protestant victories.\n\nAnglican dominance in Ireland was ensured by the passage of the Penal Laws\nthat curtailed the religious, legal, and political rights of anyone (including\nboth Catholics and Protestant Dissenters, such as Presbyterians) who did not\nconform to the state church, the Anglican Church of Ireland. As the Penal Laws\nstarted to be phased out in the latter part of the 18th century, there was\nmore competition for land, as restrictions were lifted on the Irish Catholic\nability to rent. With Irish Catholics allowed to buy land and enter trades\nfrom which they had formerly been banned, tensions arose resulting in the\nProtestant \"Peep o'Day Boys\"^[54] and Catholic \"Defenders\". This created\npolarisation between the communities and a dramatic reduction in reformers\namong Protestants, many of whom had been growing more receptive to democratic\nreform.^[54]\n\n### 1791\u20131912\n\nFollowing the foundation of the republican Society of the United Irishmen by\nPresbyterians, Catholics, and liberal Anglicans, and the resulting failed\nIrish Rebellion of 1798, sectarian violence between Catholics and Protestants\ncontinued. The Orange Order (founded 1795), with its stated goal of upholding\nthe Protestant faith and loyalty to the heirs of William of Orange, dates from\nthis period and remains active to this day.^[55]\n\nWith the Acts of Union 1800 (which came into force on 1 January 1801), a new\npolitical framework was formed with the abolition of the Irish Parliament and\nincorporation of Ireland into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\nThe result was a closer tie between Anglicans and the formerly republican\nPresbyterians as part of a \"loyal\" Protestant community. Although Catholic\nemancipation was achieved in 1829, largely eliminating official discrimination\nagainst Roman Catholics (then around 75% of Ireland's population), Dissenters,\nand Jews, the Repeal Association's campaign to repeal the 1801 Union failed.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the Home Rule movement was created and served to\ndefine the divide between most nationalists (usually Catholics) who sought the\nrestoration of an Irish Parliament, and most unionists (usually Protestants)\nwho were afraid of being a minority under a Catholic-dominated Irish\nParliament and who tended to support continuing union with Britain.\n\nUnionists and Home Rule advocates were the main political factions in late\n19th- and early 20th-century Ireland.^[56]\n\n### 1912\u20131922\n\nMain article: Partition of Ireland\n\nThe Ulster Covenant was issued in protest against the Third Home Rule Bill in\nSeptember 1912.The Proclamation of the Irish Republic was issued during the\nEaster Rising of April 1916.Irish Boundary Commission final report map (1925)\nshows religious distribution of the population. The green areas signify\nCatholic majority areas, while the red areas signify non-Catholic majority\nareas.\n\nBy the second decade of the 20th century, Home Rule, or limited Irish self-\ngovernment, was on the brink of being conceded due to the agitation of the\nIrish Parliamentary Party. In response to the campaign for Home Rule which\nstarted in the 1870s, unionists, mostly Protestant and largely concentrated in\nUlster, had resisted both self-government and independence for Ireland,\nfearing for their future in an overwhelmingly Catholic country dominated by\nthe Roman Catholic Church. In 1912, unionists led by Edward Carson signed the\nUlster Covenant and pledged to resist Home Rule by force if necessary. To this\nend, they formed the paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF).^[57]\n\nIn response, nationalists led by Eoin MacNeill formed the Irish Volunteers in\n1913, whose goal was to oppose the UVF and ensure enactment of the Third Home\nRule Bill in the event of British or unionist refusal. The outbreak of the\nFirst World War in 1914, and Ireland's involvement in the war, temporarily\naverted possible civil war in Ireland and delayed the resolution of the\nquestion of Irish independence. Home Rule, although passed in the British\nParliament with Royal Assent, was suspended for the duration of the war.\n\nThe Irish Volunteers split, with a majority, known as the National Volunteers,\nsupporting the war effort, and some of them joining Irish regiments of the New\nBritish Army. Many of those who stayed were radical nationalists, among them\nIrish Republican Brotherhood infiltrators. From these ranks came those who\nlaunched the Easter Rising in Dublin in 1916, led by Patrick Pearse and James\nConnolly. Two-and-a-half years after the executions of sixteen of the Rising's\nleaders, the separatist Sinn F\u00e9in party won the December 1918 general election\nin Ireland with 47% of the vote and a majority of seats, and set up the 1919\nFirst D\u00e1il (Irish Parliament) in Dublin. Their victory was aided by the threat\nof conscription for First World War service. The Irish War for Independence\nfollowed, leading to eventual independence in 1922 for the Irish Free State,\nwhich comprised 26 of the 32 Irish counties. In Ulster, particularly in the\nsix counties which became Northern Ireland, Sinn F\u00e9in fared relatively poorly\nin the 1918 election, and unionists won a majority.^[57]\n\nThe Government of Ireland Act 1920 partitioned the island of Ireland into two\nseparate jurisdictions, Southern Ireland and Northern Ireland, both devolved\nregions of the United Kingdom. This partition of Ireland was confirmed when\nthe Parliament of Northern Ireland exercised its right in December 1922 under\nthe Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 to opt out of the newly established Irish Free\nState.^[58] A part of the treaty signed in 1922 mandated that a boundary\ncommission would sit to decide where the frontier of the northern state would\nbe in relation to its southern neighbour. After the Irish Civil War of\n1922\u20131923, this part of the treaty was given less priority by the new Dublin\ngovernment led by W. T. Cosgrave, and was quietly dropped. As counties\nFermanagh and Tyrone and border areas of Londonderry, Armagh, and Down were\nmainly nationalist, the Irish Boundary Commission could reduce Northern\nIreland to four counties or fewer.^[57] In October 1922, the Irish Free State\ngovernment established the North-Eastern Boundary Bureau (NEBB), a government\noffice which by 1925 had prepared 56 boxes of files to argue its case for\nareas of Northern Ireland to be transferred to the Free State.^[59]\n\nNorthern Ireland remained a part of the United Kingdom, albeit under a\nseparate system of government whereby it was given its own parliament and\ndevolved government. While this arrangement met the desires of unionists to\nremain part of the United Kingdom, nationalists largely viewed the partition\nof Ireland as an illegal and arbitrary division of the island against the will\nof the majority of its people. They argued that the Northern Ireland state was\nneither legitimate nor democratic, but created with a deliberately\ngerrymandered unionist majority. Catholics initially composed about 35% of its\npopulation.^[60] A total of 557 people, mostly Catholics, were killed in\npolitical or sectarian violence from 1920 to 1922 in the six counties that\nwould become Northern Ireland, both during and after the Irish War of\nIndependence.^[61] The result was communal strife between Catholics and\nProtestants,^[62] with some historians describing this violence, especially\nthat in Belfast, as a pogrom,^[63]^[64] although historian Peter Hart argues\nthat the term is not appropriate given the reciprocity of violence in Northern\nIreland. (see Belfast Pogrom and Bloody Sunday (1921)).^[65]\n\n### 1922\u20131966\n\nSir James Craig, 1st Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, who said, \"All I\nboast is that we are a Protestant Parliament and Protestant State\"\n\nA marginalised remnant of the Irish Republican Army survived the Irish Civil\nWar. This would come to have a major impact on Northern Ireland. Although the\nIRA was proscribed on both sides of the new Irish border, it remained\nideologically committed to overthrowing both the Northern Ireland and the Free\nState governments by force of arms to unify Ireland. The government of\nNorthern Ireland passed the Special Powers Act in 1922, giving sweeping powers\nto the government and police to intern suspects without trial and to\nadminister corporal punishment such as flogging to re-establish or preserve\nlaw and order. The Act continued to be used against nationalists long after\nthe violence of this period had come to an end.^[66] Various unionist militias\nwere also incorporated into state structures, including the Ulster Special\nConstabulary, which Allen Feldman argues \"emulated the state's fusion of\nrepressive and ideological apparatuses\".^[67]\n\nIn 1920, in local elections held under proportional representation,\nnationalists had won control over many local governments, including the County\nCouncils of Fermanagh and Tyrone, and the Londonderry Borough Council\ngoverning Derry City. In response, in 1922 the new unionist government re-drew\nthe electoral boundaries to give its supporters a disproportionate majority\nand abolished proportional representation in favour of first past the post\nvoting.^[68] This resulted in control by unionists of areas such as Derry\nCity, Fermanagh, and Tyrone, where they were actually a minority of\nvoters.^[69]\n\nThe two sides' positions became strictly defined following this period. From a\nunionist perspective, Northern Ireland's nationalists were inherently disloyal\nand determined to force unionists into a united Ireland. This threat was seen\nas justifying preferential treatment of unionists in housing, employment, and\nother fields.^[citation needed] The prevalence of larger families and thus the\npotential for a more rapid population growth among Catholics was seen as a\nthreat.^[citation needed] Unionist governments ignored Edward Carson's warning\nin 1921 that alienating Catholics would make Northern Ireland inherently\nunstable. After the early 1920s, there were occasional incidents of sectarian\nunrest in Northern Ireland. These included severe rioting in Belfast in the\n1930s and 1950s, and the IRA's brief Northern Campaign in the 1940s and Border\nCampaign between 1956 and 1962, which did not enjoy broad popular support\namong nationalists. After the IRA called off its campaign in 1962, Northern\nIreland became relatively stable for a few years.^[57]\n\n## Late 1960s\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of the Troubles.\n\nThere is little agreement on the exact date of the start of the Troubles.\nDifferent writers have suggested different dates. These include the formation\nof the modern Ulster Volunteer Force in 1966,^[1] the civil rights march in\nDerry on 5 October 1968, the beginning of the 'Battle of the Bogside' on 12\nAugust 1969, or the deployment of British troops on 14 August 1969.^[57]\n\n### Civil rights campaign and unionist backlash\n\nMain article: Northern Ireland civil rights movement\n\nIn March and April 1966, Irish nationalists/republicans held parades\nthroughout Ireland to mark the 50th anniversary of the Easter Rising. On 8\nMarch, a group of Irish republicans dynamited Nelson's Pillar in Dublin. At\nthe time, the IRA was weak and not engaged in armed action, but some unionists\nwarned it was about to be revived to launch another campaign against Northern\nIreland.^[70]^[71] In April 1966, loyalists led by Ian Paisley, a Protestant\nfundamentalist preacher, founded the Ulster Constitution Defence Committee\n(UCDC). It set up a paramilitary-style wing called the Ulster Protestant\nVolunteers (UPV)^[70] to oust Terence O'Neill, Prime Minister of Northern\nIreland. Although O'Neill was a unionist, they viewed him as being too 'soft'\non the civil rights movement and opposed his policies.^[72] At the same time,\na loyalist group calling itself the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) emerged in\nthe Shankill area of Belfast. It was led by Gusty Spence, a former British\nsoldier. Many of its members were also members of the UCDC and UPV.^[73] In\nApril and May 1966, the UVF petrol bombed a number of Catholic homes, schools,\nand businesses. A firebomb killed an elderly Protestant widow, Matilda\nGould.^[70] On 21 May, the UVF issued a statement declaring \"war\" against the\nIRA and anyone helping it.^[74] The UVF fatally shot a Catholic civilian, John\nScullion, as he walked home on 27 May. A month later it shot three Catholic\ncivilians as they left a pub, killing Peter Ward, a Catholic from the Falls\nRoad.^[70]^[74] Shortly after, the UVF was proscribed by the Northern Ireland\ngovernment.^[70] The UVF is still considered a terrorist organization by the\nUnited Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.^[75]\n\nIn the mid-1960s, a non-violent civil rights campaign began in Northern\nIreland. It comprised groups such as the Northern Ireland Civil Rights\nAssociation (NICRA), the Campaign for Social Justice, the Derry Citizens'\nAction Committee, and People's Democracy,^[76] whose stated goals were:\n\n  * an end to job discrimination \u2013 it showed evidence that Catholics/nationalists were less likely to be given certain jobs, especially government jobs\n  * an end to discrimination in housing allocation \u2013 it showed evidence that unionist-controlled local councils allocated housing to Protestants ahead of Catholics/nationalists\n  * one man, one vote \u2013 in Northern Ireland, only householders could vote in local elections, while in the rest of the United Kingdom all adults could vote\n  * an end to gerrymandering of electoral boundaries \u2013 this meant that nationalists had less voting power than unionists, even where nationalists were a majority\n  * reform of the police force (Royal Ulster Constabulary) \u2013 it was over 90% Protestant and criticised for sectarianism and police brutality\n  * repeal of the Special Powers Act \u2013 this allowed police to search without a warrant, arrest and imprison people without charge or trial, ban any assemblies or parades, and ban any publications; the Act was used almost exclusively against nationalists^[70]^[77]^[78]^[79]^[80]\n\nSome suspected and accused NICRA of being a republican front-group whose\nultimate goal was to unite Ireland. Although republicans and some members of\nthe IRA (then led by Cathal Goulding and pursuing a non-violent agenda) helped\nto create and drive the movement, they did not control it and were not a\ndominant faction within it.^[57]^[81]^[82]^[83]^[84]\n\nOn 20 June 1968, civil rights activists, including nationalist Member of\nParliament (MP) Austin Currie, protested against housing discrimination by\nsquatting in a house in Caledon, County Tyrone. The local council had\nallocated the house to an unmarried 19-year-old Protestant (Emily Beattie, the\nsecretary of a local UUP politician) instead of either of two large Catholic\nfamilies with children.^[85] RUC officers \u2013 one of whom was Beattie's brother\n\u2013 forcibly removed the activists.^[85] Two days before the protest, the two\nCatholic families who had been squatting in the house next door were removed\nby police.^[86] Currie had brought their grievance to the local council and to\nStormont, but had been told to leave. The incident invigorated the civil\nrights movement.^[87]\n\nA monument to Northern Ireland's first civil rights march\n\nOn 24 August 1968, the civil rights movement held its first civil rights march\nfrom Coalisland to Dungannon. Many more marches were held over the following\nyear. Loyalists (especially members of the UPV) attacked some of the marches\nand held counter-demonstrations in a bid to get the marches banned.^[85]\nBecause of the lack of police reaction to the attacks, nationalists saw the\nRUC, which was almost wholly Protestant, as backing the loyalists and allowing\nthe attacks to occur.^[88] On 5 October 1968, a civil rights march in Derry\nwas banned by the Northern Ireland government.^[89] When marchers defied the\nban, RUC officers surrounded the marchers and beat them indiscriminately and\nwithout provocation. More than 100 people were injured, including a number of\nnationalist politicians.^[89] The incident was filmed by television news crews\nand shown around the world.^[90] It caused outrage among Catholics and\nnationalists, sparking two days of rioting in Derry between nationalists and\nthe RUC.^[89]\n\nA few days later, a student civil rights group, People's Democracy, was formed\nin Belfast.^[85] In late November, O'Neill promised the civil rights movement\nsome concessions, but these were seen as too little by nationalists and too\nmuch by loyalists. On 1 January 1969, People's Democracy began a four-day\nmarch from Belfast to Derry, which was repeatedly harassed and attacked by\nloyalists. At Burntollet Bridge, the marchers were attacked by about 200\nloyalists, including some off-duty police officers, armed with iron bars,\nbricks, and bottles in a planned ambush. When the march reached Derry City, it\nwas again attacked. The marchers claimed that police did nothing to protect\nthem and that some officers helped the attackers.^[91] That night, RUC\nofficers went on a rampage in the Bogside area of Derry, attacking Catholic\nhomes, attacking and threatening residents, and hurling sectarian abuse.^[91]\nResidents then sealed off the Bogside with barricades to keep the police out,\ncreating \"Free Derry\", which was briefly a no-go area for the security\nforces.^[92]^[93]\n\nIn March and April 1969, loyalists bombed water and electricity installations\nin Northern Ireland, blaming them on the dormant IRA and elements of the civil\nrights movement. Some attacks left much of Belfast without power and water.\nLoyalists hoped the bombings would force O'Neill to resign and bring an end to\nany concessions to nationalists.^[94]^[95] There were six bombings between 30\nMarch and 26 April.^[94]^[96] All were widely blamed on the IRA, and British\nsoldiers were sent to guard installations. Unionist support for O'Neill waned,\nand on 28 April he resigned as prime minister.^[94]\n\n### August 1969 riots and aftermath\n\nMain article: 1969 Northern Ireland riots\n\nOn 19 April, there were clashes between NICRA marchers, the RUC, and loyalists\nin the Bogside. RUC officers entered the house of Samuel Devenny (42), an\nuninvolved Catholic civilian, and beat him along with two of his teenage\ndaughters and a family friend.^[94] One of the daughters was beaten\nunconscious as she lay recovering from surgery.^[97] Devenny suffered a heart\nattack and died on 17 July from his injuries. On 13 July, RUC officers beat\nanother Catholic civilian, Francis McCloskey (67), during clashes in Dungiven.\nHe died of his injuries the next day.^[94]\n\nOn 12 August, the loyalist Apprentice Boys of Derry were allowed to march\nalong the edge of the Bogside. Taunts and missiles were exchanged between the\nloyalists and nationalist residents. After being bombarded with stones and\npetrol bombs from nationalists, the RUC, backed by loyalists, tried to storm\nthe Bogside. The RUC used CS gas, armoured vehicles, and water cannons, but\nwere kept at bay by hundreds of nationalists.^[98] The continuous fighting,\nwhich became known as the Battle of the Bogside, lasted for three days.\n\nIn response to events in Derry, nationalists held protests at RUC bases in\nBelfast and elsewhere. Some of these led to clashes with the RUC and attacks\non RUC bases. In Belfast, loyalists responded by invading nationalist\ndistricts, burning houses and businesses. There were gun battles between\nnationalists and the RUC and between nationalists and loyalists. A group of\nabout 30 IRA members was involved in the fighting in Belfast. The RUC deployed\nShorland armoured cars mounted with heavy Browning machine guns. The Shorlands\ntwice opened fire on a block of flats in a nationalist district, killing a\nnine-year-old boy named Patrick Rooney. RUC officers opened fire on rioters in\nArmagh, Dungannon, and Coalisland.^[57]\n\nDuring the riots, on 13 August, Taoiseach Jack Lynch made a television\naddress. He condemned the RUC and said that the Irish Government \"can no\nlonger stand by and see innocent people injured and perhaps worse\".^[99] He\ncalled for a United Nations peacekeeping force to be deployed and said that\nIrish Army field hospitals were being set up at the border in County Donegal\nnear Derry. Lynch added that Irish re-unification would be the only permanent\nsolution. Some interpreted the speech as a threat of military\nintervention.^[100] After the riots, Lynch ordered the Irish Army to plan for\na possible humanitarian intervention in Northern Ireland. The plan, Exercise\nArmageddon, was rejected and remained classified for thirty years.^[101]\n\nOn 14\u201315 August, British troops were deployed in Operation Banner in Derry and\nBelfast to restore order,^[102] but did not try to enter the Bogside, bringing\na temporary end to the riots. Ten people had been killed,^[103] among them\nRooney (the first child killed by police during the conflict),^[104] and 745\nhad been injured, including 154 who suffered gunshot wounds.^[105] 154 homes\nand other buildings were demolished and over 400 needed repairs, of which 83%\nof the buildings damaged were occupied by Catholics.^[105] Between July and 1\nSeptember 505 Catholic and 315 Protestant families were forced to flee their\nhomes.^[106] The Irish Army set up refugee camps in the Republic near the\nborder (see Gormanston Camp). Nationalists initially welcomed the British\nArmy, as they did not trust the RUC.^[107]\n\nOn 9 September, the Northern Ireland Joint Security Committee met at Stormont\nCastle and decided that\n\n> A peace line was to be established to separate physically the Falls and the\n> Shankill communities. Initially this would take the form of a temporary\n> barbed wire fence which would be manned by the Army and the Police ... It\n> was agreed that there should be no question of the peace line becoming\n> permanent although it was acknowledged that the barriers might have to be\n> strengthened in some locations.^[108]\n\nOn 10 September, the British Army started construction of the first \"peace\nwall\".^[109] It was the first of many such walls across Northern Ireland, and\nstill stands today.^[110]\n\nAfter the riots, the Hunt Committee was set up to examine the RUC. It\npublished its report on 12 October, recommending that the RUC become an\nunarmed force and the B Specials be disbanded. That night, loyalists took to\nthe streets of Belfast in protest at the report. During violence in the\nShankill, UVF members shot dead RUC officer Victor Arbuckle. He was the first\nRUC officer to be killed during the Troubles.^[111] In October and December\n1969, the UVF carried out a number of small bombings in the Republic of\nIreland.^[57]\n\n## 1970s\n\n### Violence peaks and Stormont collapses\n\nDuration: 10 minutes and 26 seconds.10:26\n\n1971 newsreel about the background of the conflictLoyalist banner and graffiti\non a building in the Shankill area of Belfast, 1970\n\nDespite the British government's attempt to do \"nothing that would suggest\npartiality to one section of the community\" and the improvement of the\nrelationship between the Army and the local population following the Army\nassistance with flood relief in August 1970, the Falls Curfew and a situation\nthat was described at the time as \"an inflamed sectarian one, which is being\ndeliberately exploited by the IRA and other extremists\" meant that relations\nbetween the Catholic population and the British Army rapidly\ndeteriorated.^[112]\n\nFrom 1970 to 1972, an explosion of political violence occurred in Northern\nIreland. The deadliest attack in the early 1970s was the McGurk's Bar bombing\nby the UVF in 1971.^[113] The violence peaked in 1972, when nearly 500 people,\njust over half of them civilians, were killed, the worst year in the entire\nconflict.^[114]\n\nBy the end of 1971, 29 barricades were in place in Derry, blocking access to\nwhat was known as Free Derry; 16 of these were impassable even to the British\nArmy's one-ton armoured vehicles.^[93] Many of the nationalist or republican\n\"no-go areas\" were controlled by one of the two factions of the Irish\nRepublican Army \u2013 the Provisional IRA and Official IRA. There are several\nreasons offered for why violence escalated in these years.\n\nUnionists say the main reason was the formation of the Provisional IRA and\nOfficial IRA, particularly the former.^[citation needed] These two groups were\nformed when the IRA split into the 'Provisional' and 'Official' factions.\nWhile the older IRA had embraced non-violent civil agitation,^[115] the new\nProvisional IRA was determined to wage \"armed struggle\" against British rule\nin Northern Ireland. The new IRA was willing to take on the role of \"defenders\nof the Catholic community\",^[116] rather than seeking working-class ecumenical\nunity across both communities.\n\nNationalists point to a number of events in these years to explain the upsurge\nin violence. One such incident was the Falls Curfew in July 1970, when 3,000\ntroops imposed a curfew on the nationalist Lower Falls area of Belfast, firing\nmore than 1,500 rounds of ammunition in gun battles with the Official IRA and\nkilling four people. Another was the introduction of internment without trial\nin 1971 (of 350 initial detainees, none were Protestants).^[117] Moreover, due\nto poor intelligence,^[118] very few of those interned were actually\nrepublican activists at the time, but some internees became increasingly\nradicalised as a result of their experiences.^[57]\n\nIn August 1971, ten civilians were shot dead in the Ballymurphy massacre in\nBelfast. They were innocent and the killings were unjustified, according to a\n2021 coroner's inquest. Nine victims were shot by the British Army.^[119]\n\n### Bloody Sunday\n\nMain article: Bloody Sunday (1972)\n\nBloody Sunday was the shooting dead of thirteen unarmed men by the British\nArmy at a proscribed anti-internment rally in Derry on 30 January 1972 (a\nfourteenth man died of his injuries some months later), while fifteen other\ncivilians were wounded.^[120]^[121] The march had been organised by the\nNorthern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA). The soldiers involved were\nmembers of the 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment, also known as \"1\nPara\".^[122]\n\nThis was one of the most prominent events that occurred during the Troubles as\nit was recorded as the largest number of civilians killed in a single shooting\nincident.^[123] Bloody Sunday greatly increased the hostility of Catholics and\nIrish nationalists towards the British military and government while\nsignificantly elevating tensions. As a result, the Provisional IRA gained more\nsupport, especially through rising numbers of recruits in the local\nareas.^[124]\n\nFollowing the introduction of internment, there were numerous gun battles\nbetween the British Army and both the Provisional and Official IRA. These\nincluded the Battle at Springmartin and the Battle of Lenadoon. Between 1971\nand 1975, 1,981 people were interned: 1,874 were Catholic/republican, and 107\nwere Protestant/loyalist.^[125] There were widespread allegations of abuse and\neven torture of detainees,^[126]^[127] and in 1972, the \"five techniques\" used\nby the police and army for interrogation were ruled to be illegal following a\nBritish government inquiry.^[128]\n\nThe Provisional IRA, or \"Provos\", as they became known, sought to establish\nthemselves as the defender of the nationalist community.^[129]^[130] The\nOfficial IRA (OIRA) began its own armed campaign in reaction to the ongoing\nviolence. The Provisional IRA's offensive campaign began in early 1971 when\nthe Army Council sanctioned attacks on the British Army.^[131]\n\nIn 1972, the Provisional IRA killed approximately 100 members of the security\nforces, wounded 500 others, and carried out approximately 1,300\nbombings,^[132] mostly against commercial targets which they considered \"the\nartificial economy\".^[further explanation needed]^[114]^[131]^[133] Their\nbombing campaign killed many civilians, notably on Bloody Friday on 21 July,\nwhen they set off 22 bombs in the centre of Belfast, killing five civilians,\ntwo British soldiers, a Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) reservist, and an\nUlster Defence Association (UDA) member.^[134]^[135]^[136] Ten days later,\nnine civilians were killed in a triple car bombing in Claudy.^[137] The IRA is\naccused of committing this bombing but no proof for that accusation is yet\npublished.^[138]^[139]\n\nIn 1972, the Official IRA's campaign was largely counter-productive.^[140] The\nAldershot bombing, an attack on the barracks of the Parachute Regiment in\nretaliation for Bloody Sunday, killed five female cleaners, a gardener and an\narmy chaplain.^[141] The Official IRA killed three soldiers in Derry in April,\nbut Joe McCann was killed by the Parachute Regiment in Belfast during the same\nmonth.^[140] The Official IRA called off its campaign in May 1972.^[142]\n\nBritish troop concentrations peaked at 1:50 of the civilian population, the\nhighest ratio found in the history of counterinsurgency warfare, higher than\nthat achieved during the \"Malayan Emergency\"/\"Anti-British National Liberation\nWar\" to which the conflict is frequently compared.^[143] Operation Motorman,\nthe military operation for the surge, was the biggest military operation in\nIreland since the Irish War of Independence.^[144] In total, almost 22,000\nBritish forces were involved.^[144] In the days before 31 July, about 4,000\nextra troops were brought into Northern Ireland.^[144]\n\nDespite a temporary ceasefire in 1972 and talks with British officials, the\nProvisionals were determined to continue their campaign until the achievement\nof a united Ireland. The UK government in London, believing the Northern\nIreland administration incapable of containing the security situation, sought\nto take over the control of law and order there. As this was unacceptable to\nthe Northern Ireland Government, the British government pushed through\nemergency legislation (the Northern Ireland (Temporary Provisions) Act 1972)\nwhich suspended the unionist-controlled Stormont parliament and government,\nand introduced \"direct rule\" from London. Direct rule was initially intended\nas a short-term measure; the medium-term strategy was to restore self-\ngovernment to Northern Ireland on a basis that was acceptable to both\nunionists and nationalists. Agreement proved elusive, however, and the\nTroubles continued throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and the 1990s within a context\nof political deadlock. The existence of \"no-go areas\" in Belfast and Derry was\na challenge to the authority of the British government in Northern Ireland,\nand the British Army demolished the barricades and re-established control over\nthe areas in Operation Motorman on 31 July 1972.^[57]^[133]\n\n### Sunningdale Agreement and UWC strike\n\nBelfast, 1974\n\nBritish troops and police investigate a couple behind the Europa Hotel. They\nwere taken away.\n\nLoyalist graffiti: \"You are now in Protestant teratory [sic]\"\n\nIn June 1973, following the publication of a British White Paper and a\nreferendum in March on the status of Northern Ireland, a new parliamentary\nbody, the Northern Ireland Assembly, was established. Elections to this body\nwere held on 28 June. In October 1973, mainstream nationalist and unionist\nparties, along with the British and Irish governments, negotiated the\nSunningdale Agreement, which was intended to produce a political settlement\nwithin Northern Ireland, but with a so-called \"Irish dimension\" involving the\nRepublic. The agreement provided for \"power-sharing\" \u2013 the creation of an\nexecutive containing both unionists and nationalists; and a \"Council of\nIreland\" \u2013 a body made up of ministers from Northern Ireland and the Republic\nthat was designed to encourage cross-border co-operation.\n\nUnionists were split over Sunningdale, which was also opposed by the IRA,\nwhose goal remained nothing short of an end to the existence of Northern\nIreland as part of the UK. Many unionists opposed the concept of power-\nsharing, arguing that it was not feasible to share power with nationalists who\nsought the destruction of the state. Perhaps more significant, however, was\nthe unionist opposition to the \"Irish dimension\" and the Council of Ireland,\nwhich was perceived as being an all-Ireland parliament-in-waiting. Remarks by\na young Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) councillor Hugh Logue to an\naudience at Trinity College Dublin that Sunningdale was the tool \"by which the\nUnionists will be trundled off to a united Ireland\" also damaged chances of\nsignificant unionist support for the agreement. In January 1974, Brian\nFaulkner was narrowly deposed as UUP leader and replaced by Harry West,\nalthough Faulkner retained his position as Chief Executive in the new\ngovernment. A UK general election in February 1974 gave the anti-Sunningdale\nunionists the opportunity to test unionist opinion with the slogan \"Dublin is\nonly a Sunningdale away\", and the result galvanised their support: they won 11\nof the 12 seats, winning 58% of the vote with most of the rest going to\nnationalists and pro-Sunningdale unionists.^[57]^[133]\n\nUltimately, the Sunningdale Agreement was brought down by mass action on the\npart of loyalist paramilitaries and workers, who formed the Ulster Workers'\nCouncil. They organised a general strike, the Ulster Workers' Council strike.\nThis severely curtailed business in Northern Ireland and cut off essential\nservices such as water and electricity. Nationalists argue that the British\nGovernment did not do enough to break this strike and uphold the Sunningdale\ninitiative. There is evidence that the strike was further encouraged by MI5, a\npart of their campaign to 'disorientate' British prime minister Harold\nWilson's government^[145] (see also Harold Wilson conspiracy theories). Faced\nwith such opposition, the pro-Sunningdale unionists resigned from the power-\nsharing government and the new regime collapsed. Three days into the UWC\nstrike, on 17 May 1974, two UVF teams from the Belfast and Mid-Ulster\nbrigades^[74] detonated three no-warning car bombs in Dublin's city centre\nduring the Friday evening rush hour, resulting in 26 deaths and close to 300\ninjuries. Ninety minutes later, a fourth car bomb exploded in Monaghan,\nkilling seven additional people. Nobody has ever been convicted for these\nattacks^[57]^[133] and the bombings were the greatest loss of life in a single\nday during the Troubles.^[123]^[146]\n\n### Proposal of an independent Northern Ireland\n\nEven as his government deployed troops in August 1969, Wilson ordered a secret\nstudy of whether the British military could withdraw from Northern Ireland,\nincluding all 45 bases, such as the submarine school in Derry. The study\nconcluded that the military could do so in three months, but if increased\nviolence collapsed civil society, Britain would have to send in troops again.\nWithout bases, to do so would be an invasion of Ireland; Wilson thus decided\nagainst a withdrawal.^[147]\n\nWilson's cabinet discussed the more drastic step of complete British\nwithdrawal from an independent Northern Ireland as early as February 1969, as\none of various possibilities for the region including direct rule.^[148] He\nwrote in 1971 that Britain had \"responsibility without power\" there,^[149] and\nsecretly met with the IRA that year while leader of the opposition; his\ngovernment in late 1974 and early 1975 again met with the IRA to negotiate a\nceasefire. During the meetings, the parties discussed complete British\nwithdrawal.^[150] Although the British government publicly stated that troops\nwould stay as long as necessary, widespread fear from the Birmingham pub\nbombings and other IRA attacks in Britain itself increased support among MPs\nand the public for a military withdrawal.^[151]\n\nThe failure of Sunningdale and the effectiveness of the UWC strike against\nBritish authority were more evidence to Wilson of his 1971 statement. They led\nto the serious consideration in London of independence until November 1975.\nHad the withdrawal occurred \u2013 which Wilson supported but others, including\nJames Callaghan, opposed \u2013 the region would have become a separate\ndominion.^[149]^[150] According to the secret plan, codenamed\n\"Doomsday\",^[152] Britain would have had as little to do with the new \"Ulster\nDominion\" as possible, with financial subsidies ending within five years. It\nwould not have been an associated state, with Britain in control only of\nforeign relations, because a war between Ulster and the Republic would involve\nBritain.^[149] The dominion would also not have been a member of the British\nCommonwealth.^[152] The Northern Ireland Office cited the 1948 Newfoundland\nreferendums \u2013 in which the island voluntarily joined Canada, its larger\nneighbor \u2013 as an example that divided Ireland might hopefully follow.^[149]\n\nThe British negotiations with the IRA, an illegal organisation, angered the\nRepublic's government. It did not know what was discussed but feared that the\nBritish were considering abandoning Northern Ireland. Irish Foreign Minister\nGarret FitzGerald discussed in a memorandum of June 1975 the possibilities of\norderly withdrawal and independence, repartition of the island, or a collapse\nof Northern Ireland into civil war and anarchy. The memorandum preferred a\nnegotiated independence as the best of the three \"worst case scenarios\", but\nconcluded that the Irish government could do little.^[150]\n\nThe Irish government had already failed to prevent a crowd from burning down\nthe British Embassy in 1972. It believed that it could not enlarge the\ncountry's small army of 12,500 men without negative consequences. A civil war\nin Northern Ireland would cause many deaths there and severe consequences for\nthe Republic, as the public would demand that it intervene to protect\nnationalists. FitzGerald warned Callaghan that the failure to intervene,\ndespite Ireland's inability to do so, would \"threaten democratic government in\nthe Republic\", which would jeopardise British and European security against\nCommunist and other foreign nations.^[150]\n\nWilson's aides had in 1969 come to a similar conclusion, telling him that\nremoving Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom would cause violence and a\nmilitary intervention by the Republic that would not allow the removal of\nBritish troops.^[148] Loyalist leader Glen Barr said in 2008 that a British\nwithdrawal would have caused civil war, as Loyalists would have expected the\nRepublic to invade Northern Ireland.^[152] Peter Ramsbotham, British\nAmbassador to the United States, warned of a hostile American reaction.^[149]\n\nThe British so wanted to leave Northern Ireland in 1975, however, that only\nthe catastrophic consequences of doing so prevented it.^[149]^[failed\nverification] The Irish government so dreaded the consequences that FitzGerald\nrefused to ask Britain not to withdraw \u2013 as he feared that openly discussing\nthe issue could permit the British to proceed \u2013 and other members of\ngovernment opposed the Irish Cabinet even discussing what FitzGerald referred\nto as a \"doomsday scenario\". He wrote in 2006 that \"Neither then nor since has\npublic opinion in Ireland realised how close to disaster our whole island came\nduring the last two years of Harold Wilson's premiership\",^[150] and in 2008\nsaid that the Republic \"was more at risk then than at any time since our\nformation\".^[152]\n\n### Mid-1970s\n\nThe Irish National Liberation Army began operations in the mid-1970s.\n\nIn February 1974, an IRA time bomb killed 12 people on a coach on the M62 in\nthe West Riding of Yorkshire.^[153] Merlyn Rees, the Secretary of State for\nNorthern Ireland, lifted the proscription against the UVF in April 1974. In\nDecember, a month after the Birmingham pub bombings killed 21 people, the IRA\ndeclared a ceasefire; this would theoretically last throughout most of the\nfollowing year. The ceasefire notwithstanding, sectarian killings escalated in\n1975, along with internal feuding between rival paramilitary groups. This made\n1975 one of the \"bloodiest years of the conflict\".^[74]\n\nOn 5 April 1975, Irish republican paramilitary members killed a UDA volunteer\nand four Protestant civilians in a gun and bomb attack at the Mountainview\nTavern on the Shankill Road, Belfast. The attack was claimed by the Republican\nAction Force believed to be a covername used by Provisional IRA (IRA)\nvolunteers.^[154]^[155]\n\nOn 31 July 1975 at Buskhill, outside Newry, popular Irish cabaret band the\nMiami Showband was returning home to Dublin after a gig in Banbridge when it\nwas ambushed by gunmen from the UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade wearing British Army\nuniforms at a bogus military roadside checkpoint on the main A1 road. Three of\nthe bandmembers, two Catholics and a Protestant, were shot dead, while two of\nthe UVF men were killed when the bomb they had loaded onto the band's minibus\ndetonated prematurely. The following January, eleven Protestant workers were\ngunned down in Kingsmill, South Armagh after having been ordered off their bus\nby an armed republican gang, which called itself the South Armagh Republican\nAction Force. This resulted in 10 fatalities, with one man surviving despite\nbeing shot 18 times. These killings were reportedly in retaliation to a\nloyalist double shooting attack against the Reavey and O'Dowd families the\nprevious night.^[57]^[114]^[133]\n\nThe violence continued through the rest of the 1970s. This included a series\nof attacks in Southern England in 1974 and 1975 by Provisional IRA active\nservice unit the Balcombe Street Gang.^[156] The British Government reinstated\nthe ban against the UVF in October 1975, making it once more an illegal\norganisation. The Provisional IRA's December 1974 ceasefire officially ended\nin January 1976, although it had carried out several attacks in\n1975.^[157]^[158] The Provisional IRA had lost the hope it had felt in the\nearly 1970s that it could force a rapid British withdrawal from Northern\nIreland, and instead developed a strategy known as the \"Long War\", which\ninvolved a less intense but more sustained campaign of violence that could\ncontinue indefinitely.^[159] The Official IRA ceasefire of 1972, however,\nbecame permanent, and the \"Official\" movement eventually evolved into the\nWorkers' Party, which rejected violence completely. However, a splinter from\nthe \"Officials\" \u2013 the Irish National Liberation Army \u2013 continued a campaign of\nviolence in 1974.^[133]\n\n### Late 1970s\n\nBy the late 1970s, war-weariness was visible in both communities. One sign of\nthis was the formation of the Peace People, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in\n1976. The Peace People organised large demonstrations calling for an end to\nparamilitary violence. Their campaign lost momentum, however, after they\nappealed to the nationalist community to provide information on the IRA to\nsecurity forces.^[160]\n\nIn February 1978, the IRA bombed La Mon, a hotel restaurant in Comber, County\nDown.^[161] The decade ended with a double attack by the IRA against the\nBritish. On 27 August 1979, Lord Mountbatten, while on holiday in Mullaghmore,\nCounty Sligo, was killed by a bomb planted on board his boat. Three other\npeople were also killed: Lady Brabourne, the elderly mother of Mountbatten's\nson-in-law; and two teenagers, a grandson of Mountbatten and a local\nboatman.^[114] That same day, eighteen British soldiers, mostly members of the\nParachute Regiment, were killed by two remote-controlled bombs in the\nWarrenpoint ambush at Narrow Water Castle, near Warrenpoint, County Down.^[74]\nIt was the British Army's largest loss of life in a single incident in\nOperation Banner.^[162]\n\nSuccessive British Governments, having failed to achieve a political\nsettlement, tried to \"normalise\" Northern Ireland. Aspects included the\nremoval of internment without trial and the removal of political status for\nparamilitary prisoners. From 1972 onward, paramilitaries were tried in\njuryless Diplock courts to avoid intimidation of jurors. On conviction, they\nwere to be treated as ordinary criminals. Resistance to this policy among\nrepublican prisoners led to more than 500 of them in the Maze prison\ninitiating the \"blanket\" and \"dirty\" protests. Their protests culminated in\nhunger strikes in 1980 and 1981, aimed at the restoration of political status,\nas well as other concessions.^[57]^[133]\n\n## 1980s\n\nRepublican mural in Belfast commemorating the hunger strikes of 1981\n\nIn the 1981 Irish hunger strike, ten republican prisoners (seven from the\nProvisional IRA and three from the INLA) died of starvation. The first hunger\nstriker to die, Bobby Sands, was elected to Parliament on an Anti-H-Block\nticket, as was his election agent Owen Carron following Sands's death. The\nhunger strikes resonated among many nationalists; over 100,000 people^[163]\nattended Sands's funeral mass in West Belfast and thousands attended those of\nthe other hunger strikers. From an Irish republican perspective, the\nsignificance of these events was to demonstrate potential for a political and\nelectoral strategy.^[164]\n\nIn the wake of the hunger strikes, Sinn F\u00e9in, which had become the Provisional\nIRA's political wing,^[163]^[165]^[166] began to contest elections for the\nfirst time in both Northern Ireland (as abstentionists) and in the Republic.\nIn 1986, Sinn F\u00e9in recognised the legitimacy of the Irish D\u00e1il, which caused a\nsmall group of members to break away and form Republican Sinn F\u00e9in.^[57]\n\nThe IRA's \"Long War\" was boosted by large donations of arms from Libya in the\n1980s (see Provisional IRA arms importation) partly due to Muammar Gaddafi's\nanger at British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government for assisting\nthe Reagan government's 1986 bombing of Libya, which had allegedly killed one\nof Gaddafi's children. Additionally, it received funding from supporters in\nthe Republic of Ireland and the United States and elsewhere throughout the\nIrish diaspora.^[167] Loyalist paramilitaries also received significant\nfunding and arms from supporters in Canada and Scotland.^[168]^[169]\n\nBritish troops in South Belfast, 1981\n\nIn July 1982, the IRA bombed military ceremonies in London's Hyde Park and\nRegent's Park, killing four soldiers, seven bandsmen, and seven horses.^[170]\nThe INLA was highly active in the early and mid-1980s. In December 1982, it\nbombed a disco in Ballykelly, County Londonderry, frequented by off-duty\nBritish soldiers which killed 11 soldiers and six civilians.^[114] In December\n1983, the IRA attacked Harrods using a car bomb, killing six people.^[171] One\nof the IRA's most high-profile actions in this period was the Brighton hotel\nbombing on 12 October 1984, when it set off a 100-pound time bomb in the Grand\nBrighton Hotel in Brighton, where politicians including Thatcher were staying\nfor the Conservative Party conference. The bomb, which exploded in the early\nhours of the morning, killed five people, including Conservative MP Sir\nAnthony Berry, and injured 34 others.^[172]\n\nThe Grand Brighton Hotel after the IRA bomb attack in October 1984\n\nOn 28 February 1985 in Newry, nine RUC officers were killed in a mortar attack\non the police station.^[173]^[174] It was planned by the IRA's South Armagh\nBrigade and an IRA unit in Newry. Nine shells were fired from a mark 10 mortar\nwhich was bolted onto the back of a hijacked Ford van in Crossmaglen. Eight\nshells overshot the station; the ninth hit a portable cabin which was being\nused as a canteen. It was the RUC's largest loss of life during the\nTroubles.^[173] On 8 May 1987, eight IRA members attacked an RUC station in\nLoughgall, County Armagh, using a bomb and guns.^[175] All were killed by the\nSAS \u2013 the most IRA members killed in a single incident in the Troubles.^[175]\nOn 8 November 1987 in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, a Provisional IRA time\nbomb exploded during a Remembrance Sunday ceremony for UK Commonwealth war\ncasualties. The bomb went off near a cenotaph that was at the heart of the\nparade. Eleven people (ten civilians and one serving member of the RUC) were\nkilled and 63 were injured. Former school headmaster Ronnie Hill was seriously\ninjured in the bombing and slipped into a coma two days later, remaining in\nthis condition for more than a decade before his death in December 2000.^[176]\nThe unit that carried out the bombing was disbanded.^[when?] Loyalist\nparamilitaries responded to the bombing with revenge attacks on Catholics,\nmostly civilians.^[177] Another bomb had been planted at nearby Tullyhommon at\na parallel Remembrance Day commemoration but failed to detonate.^[133]\n\nIn March 1988, three IRA volunteers who were planning a bombing were shot dead\nby the SAS at a Shell petrol station on Winston Churchill Avenue in Gibraltar,\nthe British Overseas Territory attached to the south of Spain. This became\nknown as Operation Flavius. Their funeral at Milltown Cemetery in Belfast was\nattacked by Michael Stone, a UDA member who threw grenades as the coffin was\nlowered and shot at people who chased him. Stone killed three people,\nincluding IRA volunteer Kevin Brady. Stone was jailed for life the following\nyear, but was freed 11 years later under the Good Friday Agreement.^[178] Two\nBritish Army corporals, David Howes and Derek Wood, who were in plain clothes,\ndrove their car into Brady's funeral cortege in Andersonstown. The crowd\nassumed the soldiers were loyalists intent on repeating Stone's attack; dozens\nof people surrounded and attacked their car. The soldiers were pulled out of\ntheir car, kidnapped and shot dead by the IRA. This became known as the\nCorporals killings.^[57]^[133]\n\nIn September 1989, the IRA used a time bomb to attack the Royal Marine Depot,\nDeal in Kent, killing 11 bandsmen.^[179]\n\nTowards the end of the decade, the British Army tried to soften its public\nappearance to residents in communities such as Derry in order to improve\nrelations between the local community and the military. Soldiers were told not\nto use the telescopic sights on their rifles to scan the streets, as civilians\nbelieved they were being aimed at. Soldiers were also encouraged to wear\nberets when manning checkpoints (and later other situations) rather than\nhelmets, which were perceived as militaristic and hostile. The system of\ncomplaints was overhauled \u2013 if civilians believed they were being harassed or\nabused by soldiers in the streets or during searches and made a complaint,\nthey would never find out what action (if any) was taken. The new regulations\nrequired an officer to visit the complainants house to inform them of the\noutcome of their complaint.^[180]\n\nIn the 1980s, loyalist paramilitary groups, including the Ulster Volunteer\nForce, the Ulster Defence Association, and Ulster Resistance, imported arms\nand explosives from South Africa.^[74] The weapons obtained were divided\nbetween the UDA, the UVF, and Ulster Resistance, although some of the weaponry\n(such as rocket-propelled grenades) were hardly used. In 1987, the Irish\nPeople's Liberation Organisation (IPLO), a breakaway faction of the INLA,\nengaged in a bloody feud against the INLA which weakened the INLA's presence\nin some areas. By 1992, the IPLO was destroyed by the Provisionals for its\ninvolvement in drug dealing, thus ending the feud.^[57]\n\n## 1990s\n\nMain article: Northern Ireland peace process\n\n### Escalation in South Armagh\n\nThe IRA's South Armagh Brigade had made the countryside village of Crossmaglen\ntheir stronghold since the 1970s. The surrounding villages of Silverbridge,\nCullyhanna, Cullaville, Forkhill, Jonesborough, and Creggan were also IRA\nstrongholds. In February 1978, a British Army Gazelle helicopter was shot down\nnear Silverbridge, killing Lieutenant Colonel Ian Corden-Lloyd.^[181]\n\n'Sniper at Work' sign in Crossmaglen\n\nIn the 1990s, the IRA came up with a new plan to restrict British Army foot\npatrols near Crossmaglen. They developed two sniper teams to attack British\nArmy and RUC patrols.^[182] They usually fired from an improvised armoured car\nusing a .50 BMG calibre M82 sniper rifle. Signs were put up around South\nArmagh reading \"Sniper at Work\". The snipers killed a total of nine members of\nthe security forces: seven soldiers and two constables. The last to be killed\nbefore the Good Friday Agreement was a British soldier, bombardier Steven\nRestorick.\n\nThe IRA had developed the capacity to attack helicopters in South Armagh and\nelsewhere since the 1980s,^[183] including the 1990 shootdown of a Gazelle\nflying over the border between counties Tyrone and Monaghan by the East Tyrone\nBrigade; there were no fatalities in any of those incidents.^[184]\n\nAnother incident involving British helicopters in South Armagh was the Battle\nof Newry Road in September 1993.^[185] Two other helicopters, a British Army\nLynx and a Royal Air Force Puma were shot down by improvised mortar fire in\n1994. The IRA set up checkpoints in South Armagh during this period, which\nwere unchallenged by the security forces.^[183]^[186]\n\n### Downing Street mortar attack\n\nPolice officers looking at a burned van used by the IRA in the 1991 mortar\nattack on 10 Downing Street\n\nOn 7 February 1991, the IRA attempted to assassinate prime minister John Major\nand his war cabinet by launching a mortar at 10 Downing Street while they were\ngathered there to discuss the Gulf War.^[187] The mortar bombing caused only\nfour injuries, two of which were to police officers, while Major and the\nentire war cabinet were unharmed.^[187]\n\n### First ceasefire\n\nAfter a prolonged period of background political manoeuvring, during which the\n1992 Baltic Exchange and 1993 Bishopsgate bombings occurred in London, both\nloyalist and republican paramilitary groups declared ceasefires in 1994. The\nyear leading up to the ceasefires included a mass shooting in Castlerock,\nCounty Londonderry in which four people were killed. The IRA responded with\nthe Shankill Road bombing in October 1993, which aimed to kill the UDA\nleadership, but instead killed eight Protestant civilian shoppers and a low-\nranking UDA member, as well as one of the perpetrators, who was killed when\nthe bomb detonated prematurely. The UDA responded with attacks in nationalist\nareas including a mass shooting in Greysteel, in which eight civilians were\nkilled \u2013 six Catholics and two Protestants.^[57]\n\nOn 16 June 1994, just before the ceasefires, the Irish National Liberation\nArmy killed three UVF members in a gun attack on the Shankill Road. In\nrevenge, three days later the UVF killed six civilians in a shooting at a pub\nin Loughinisland, County Down. The IRA, in the remaining month before its\nceasefire, killed four senior loyalist paramilitaries, three from the UDA and\none from the UVF. On 31 August 1994, the IRA declared a ceasefire. The\nloyalist paramilitaries, temporarily united in the \"Combined Loyalist Military\nCommand\", reciprocated six weeks later. Although these ceasefires failed in\nthe short run, they marked an effective end to large-scale political violence,\nas they paved the way for the final ceasefires.^[57]^[133]\n\nIn 1995, the United States appointed George J. Mitchell as the United States\nSpecial Envoy for Northern Ireland. Mitchell was recognised as being more than\na token envoy and as representing a President (Bill Clinton) with a deep\ninterest in events.^[188] The British and Irish governments agreed that\nMitchell would chair an international commission on disarmament of\nparamilitary groups.^[189]\n\n### Second ceasefire\n\nOn 9 February 1996, less than two years after the declaration of the\nceasefire, the IRA revoked it with the Docklands bombing in the Canary Wharf\narea of London, killing two people, injuring 39 others,^[190] and causing \u00a385\nmillion in damage to the city's financial centre. Sinn F\u00e9in blamed the failure\nof the ceasefire on the British Government's refusal to begin all-party\nnegotiations until the IRA decommissioned its weapons.^[191]\n\nThe destruction caused by the Docklands bombing in London, 1996\n\nThe attack was followed by several more, most notably the 1996 Manchester\nbombing, which destroyed a large area of the centre of the city on 15 June. It\nwas the largest bomb attack in Britain since World War II. While the attack\navoided any fatalities due to a telephone warning and the rapid response of\nthe emergency services, over 200 people were injured in the attack, many of\nthem outside the established cordon. The damage caused by the blast was\nestimated at \u00a3411 million. Lance bombardier Stephen Restorick, the last\nBritish soldier killed during the Troubles, was shot dead at a checkpoint on\nthe Green Rd near Bessbrook on 12 February 1997 by the IRA's South Armagh\nsniper.^[192]\n\nThe IRA reinstated their ceasefire in July 1997, as negotiations for the\ndocument that became known as the Good Friday Agreement began without Sinn\nF\u00e9in. In September of the same year, Sinn F\u00e9in signed the Mitchell Principles\nand were admitted to the talks. The UVF was the first paramilitary grouping to\nsplit as a result of their ceasefire, spawning the Loyalist Volunteer Force\n(LVF) in 1996. In December 1997, the INLA assassinated LVF leader Billy\nWright, leading to a series of revenge killings by loyalist groups. A group\nsplit from the Provisional IRA and formed the Real IRA (RIRA).^[193]\n\nIn August 1998, a Real IRA bomb in Omagh killed 29 civilians, the most by a\nsingle bomb during the Troubles.^[123] This bombing discredited \"dissident\nrepublicans\" and their campaigns in the eyes of many who had previously\nsupported the Provisionals' campaign. They became small groups with little\ninfluence, but still capable of violence.^[194]\n\nThe INLA also declared a ceasefire after the Good Friday Agreement. Since\nthen, most paramilitary violence has been directed at their \"own\" communities\nand at other factions within their organisations. The UDA, for example, has\nfeuded with their fellow loyalists the UVF on two occasions since 2000. There\nhave been internal struggles for power between \"brigade commanders\" and\ninvolvement in organised crime.^[195]\n\n### Political process\n\nA republican mural in Belfast during the mid-1990s bidding \"safe home\" (Sl\u00e1n\nAbhaile) to British troops. Security normalisation was one of the key points\nof the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nAfter the ceasefires, talks began between the main political parties in\nNorthern Ireland to establish political agreement. These talks led to the Good\nFriday Agreement of 1998. This Agreement restored self-government to Northern\nIreland on the basis of \"power-sharing\". In 1999, an executive was formed\nconsisting of the four main parties, including Sinn F\u00e9in. Other important\nchanges included the reform of the RUC, renamed as the Police Service of\nNorthern Ireland, which was required to recruit at least a 50% quota of\nCatholics for ten years, and the removal of Diplock courts under the Justice\nand Security (Northern Ireland) Act 2007.^[196]\n\nA security normalisation process also began as part of the treaty, which\ncomprised the progressive closing of redundant British Army barracks, border\nobservation towers, and the withdrawal of all forces taking part in Operation\nBanner \u2013 including the resident battalions of the Royal Irish Regiment \u2013 that\nwould be replaced by an infantry brigade, deployed in ten sites around\nNorthern Ireland but with no operative role in the province.^[8]\n\nThe power-sharing Executive and Assembly were suspended in 2002, when\nunionists withdrew following \"Stormontgate\", a controversy over allegations of\nan IRA spy ring operating at Stormont. There were ongoing tensions about the\nProvisional IRA's failure to disarm fully and sufficiently quickly. IRA\ndecommissioning has since been completed (in September 2005) to the\nsatisfaction of most parties.^[197]\n\nA feature of Northern Ireland politics since the Agreement has been eclipsed\nin electoral terms of parties such as the SDLP and Ulster Unionist Party (UUP)\nby rival parties such as Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP. Similarly, although political\nviolence is greatly reduced, sectarian animosity has not disappeared.\nResidential areas are more segregated between Catholic nationalists and\nProtestant unionists than ever.^[198]^[needs update?] Thus, progress towards\nrestoring the power-sharing institutions was slow and tortuous. On 8 May 2007,\ndevolved government returned to Northern Ireland. DUP leader Ian Paisley and\nSinn F\u00e9in's Martin McGuinness took office as First Minister and deputy First\nMinister, respectively.^[199]\n\n## Support outside Northern Ireland\n\n### Arms importation\n\nFurther information: Provisional IRA in the Republic of Ireland, Provisional\nIrish Republican Army arms importation, Official Irish Republican Army \u00a7\nSupport, and Irish National Liberation Army \u00a7 Arms importation\n\nBoth Republican and Loyalist paramilitaries sought to obtain weapons outside\nof Northern Ireland in order to achieve their objectives. Irish Republican\nparamilitaries received the vast majority of external support. Over the years,\nthe Provisional IRA imported arms from external sources such as sympathisers\nin the Republic of Ireland, Irish diaspora communities within the Anglosphere,\nmainland Europe, the Palestine Liberation Organization, and Libyan dictator\nMuammar Gaddafi. The Soviet Union and North Korea supplied the Official IRA\nwith 5,000 weapons,^[200] and the INLA received considerable arms from\noverseas as well.\n\nThe IRA's primary external support was from the Republic of Ireland, whose\nsafe haven allowed the group to raise legal and illegal funds, organise and\ntrain, and manufacture a large number of firearms and explosives with ease and\nthen smuggled them into Northern Ireland and England.^[201] The IRA's primary\nweapon in the Republic was explosives (including gelignite, fertiliser, and\nANFO), which were responsible for the vast majority of the bombings in\nNorthern Ireland and England throughout the conflict.^[201] While the plastic\nexplosive Semtex donated by Gaddafi was appreciated and infamous in IRA\nbombing campaigns, they were actually sparsely used. Notable events of IRA\nbombs of Irish origin included Bloody Friday, the Warrenpoint ambush, the\nassassination of Lord Mountbatten, and the Hyde Park and Regent's Park\nbombings.\n\nLoyalist paramilitaries also received support, mainly from Protestant\nsupporters in Canada, England, and Scotland (including members of the Orange\nOrder). From 1979 to 1986, loyalist paramilitaries imported up to 100 machine\nguns and \"as many rifles, grenade launchers, magnum revolvers and hundreds of\nthousands of rounds of ammunition from Canada.\"^[202] Members of the Grand\nOrange Lodge of Scotland sent gelignite explosives to UDA and UVF\nmembers.^[203]^[204]^[205] British Army's Force Research Unit (FRU) agent\nBrian Nelson also secured a large amount of weaponry from the South African\ngovernment to loyalists.^[206]\n\n### Funding\n\nFurther information: Paramilitary finances in the Troubles\n\nIrish Republican and Loyalist militants also received significant funding from\ngroups, individuals, and state actors outside Northern Ireland. From the 1970s\nto the early 1990s, Libya gave the IRA over $12.5 million in cash (the\nequivalent of roughly $40 million in 2021).^[207]^[208]^[209] The IRA also\nreceived at least $2 million from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia\n(FARC) in exchange for training them with bomb techniques, including shaped\ncharges, propane bombs, landmines, and the construction of mortars (see also\nthe Colombia Three).^[210] On the Loyalist side, the Northern Ireland Affairs\nSelect Committee report of June 2002 stated that \"in 1992 it was estimated\nthat Scottish support for the UDA and UVF might amount to \u00a3100,000 a\nyear.\"^[211]\n\nIn the Anglosphere outside Great Britain, Irish Americans, Irish Canadians,\nIrish Australians, and Irish New Zealanders provided considerable or\nsubstantial financial donations to the Republican movement, mostly the\nProvisionals.^[212]^[213]^[214] The financial backbone of the Provisional\ncause in America was the Irish Northern Aid Committee (NORAID), which was\nestimated to have raised $3.6 million between 1970 and 1991, including for\nsupporting families of dead or imprisoned IRA members, lobbying and propaganda\nefforts, and sometimes purchasing weapons for the Provisional\nIRA.^[215]^[216]^[217]^[218]^[219]^[220] In Australia, officials estimated\nthat by the 1990s, no more than A$20,000 were raised annually for the\nProvisionals.^[221] Canadian supporters raised money to secretly purchase\nweapons, notably detonators used for Canadian mining sites and smuggled to the\nIRA.^[222]^[223]^[224]\n\nHowever, nearly all or the vast majority of the funding for both Republican\nand Loyalist paramilitaries came from criminal and business activities within\nthe island of Ireland and Great Britain.^[225]^[226]^[211]^[201] The Northern\nIreland Affairs Select Committee report of June 2002 stated that:\n\n> Historically, the vast majority of paramilitary funds for both Republican\n> and Loyalist groups have been generated within Northern Ireland. The primary\n> reason for this is the relative ease of raising funds within these\n> communities. Sympathy for the cause is greatest within the originating\n> community. Those concerned also have the local knowledge which facilitates\n> crime or the direct intimidation of individuals from whom money is sought.\n> The fact that Northern Ireland remains predominantly a cash economy also\n> encourages a local focus, as it facilitates money laundering and makes it\n> difficult for the law enforcement agencies to trace transactions.^[211]\n\n## Collusion between security forces and paramilitaries\n\nA republican mural in Belfast with the slogan \"Collusion is not an illusion\"\n\nThere were many incidents of collusion between the British state security\nforces (the British Army and RUC) and loyalist paramilitaries. This included\nsoldiers and policemen taking part in loyalist attacks while off-duty, giving\nweapons and intelligence to loyalists, not taking action against loyalists,\nand hindering police investigations. The De Silva Report found that, during\nthe 1980s, 85% of the intelligence loyalists used to target people came from\nthe security forces,^[227] who in turn also had double agents and informers\nwithin loyalist groups who organised attacks on the orders of or with the\nknowledge of their handlers. Of the 210 loyalists arrested by the Stevens\nInquiries team, all but three were found to be state agents or\ninformers.^[228]\n\nThe British Army's locally recruited Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) was almost\nwholly Protestant.^[229]^[230] Despite recruits being vetted, some loyalist\nmilitants managed to enlist, mainly to obtain weapons, training, and\ninformation.^[231] A 1973 British Government document (uncovered in 2004),\nSubversion in the UDR, suggested that 5\u201315% of UDR soldiers then were members\nof loyalist paramilitaries.^[231]^[232] The report said the UDR was the main\nsource of weapons for those groups,^[231] although by 1973, UDR weapons losses\nhad dropped significantly, partly due to stricter controls.^[231] In 1977, the\nArmy investigated a UDR battalion based at Girdwood Barracks, Belfast. The\ninvestigation found that 70 soldiers had links to the UVF, that thirty\nsoldiers had fraudulently diverted up to \u00a347,000 to the UVF, and that UVF\nmembers socialised with soldiers in their mess. Following this, two UDR\nmembers were dismissed.^[233] The investigation was halted after a senior\nofficer claimed it was harming morale.^[233] By 1990, at least 197 UDR\nsoldiers had been convicted of loyalist terrorist offences and other serious\ncrimes, including 19 convicted of murder.^[234] This was only a small fraction\nof those who served in the UDR, but the proportion was higher than the regular\nBritish Army, the RUC, and the civilian population.^[235]\n\nDuring the 1970s, the Glenanne gang \u2013 a secret alliance of loyalist militants,\nBritish soldiers, and RUC officers \u2013 carried out a string of gun and bomb\nattacks against nationalists in an area of Northern Ireland known as the\n\"murder triangle\".^[236]^[237] It also carried out some attacks in the\nRepublic, killing about 120 people in total, mostly uninvolved\ncivilians.^[238] The Cassel Report investigated 76 murders attributed to the\ngroup and found evidence that soldiers and policemen were involved in 74 of\nthose.^[239] One member, RUC officer John Weir, claimed his superiors knew of\nthe collusion but allowed it to continue.^[240] The Cassel Report also stated\nsome senior officers knew of the crimes but did nothing to prevent,\ninvestigate, or punish perpetrators.^[239] Attacks attributed to the group\ninclude the Dublin and Monaghan bombings (1974), the Miami Showband killings\n(1975), and the Reavey and O'Dowd killings (1976).^[241]\n\nThe Stevens Inquiries found that elements of the security forces had used\nloyalists as \"proxies\"^[242] who, via double-agents and informers, had helped\nloyalist groups to kill targeted individuals, usually suspected republicans\nbut also civilians both intentionally and otherwise. The inquiries concluded\nthis had intensified and prolonged the conflict.^[243]^[244] The British\nArmy's Force Research Unit (FRU) was the main agency involved.^[242] Brian\nNelson, the UDA's chief 'intelligence officer', was a FRU agent.^[245] Through\nNelson, FRU helped loyalists target people for assassination. FRU commanders\nsay they helped loyalists target only suspected or known republican activists\nand prevented the killing of civilians.^[242] The Inquiries found evidence\nonly two lives were saved and that Nelson/FRU was responsible for at least 30\nmurders and many other attacks, many on civilians.^[243] One victim was\nsolicitor Pat Finucane. Nelson also supervised the shipping of weapons to\nloyalists in 1988.^[245] From 1992 to 1994, loyalists were responsible for\nmore deaths than republicans,^[246] partly due to FRU involvement.^[247]^[248]\nMembers of the security forces tried to obstruct the Stevens\ninvestigation.^[244]^[249]\n\nA Police Ombudsman report from 2007 revealed that UVF members had been allowed\nto commit a string of terrorist offences, including murder, while working as\ninformers for RUC Special Branch. It found that Special Branch had given\ninformers immunity by ensuring they were not caught or convicted and blocking\nweapons searches.^[250] Ombudsman Nuala O'Loan concluded that this had led to\n\"hundreds\" of deaths^[228] and said senior British Government officials\npressured her into halting her investigation.^[251] UVF member Robin Jackson\nhas been linked to between 50^[252]^[253] and 100^[237] killings in Northern\nIreland, although he was never convicted for any.^[254] It is alleged by many,\nincluding members of the security forces, that Jackson was an RUC agent.^[254]\nThe Irish Government's Barron Report alleged that Jackson also \"had\nrelationships with British Intelligence\".^[255] In 2016, a new Ombudsman\nreport concluded that there had been collusion between the police and the UVF\nin relation to the deaths of six Catholic men in the 1994 Loughinisland\nmassacre and that the investigation was undermined by the wish to protect\ninformers, but found no evidence police had foreknowledge of the attack.^[256]\n\nThe Smithwick Tribunal concluded that a member of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na (the\nRepublic of Ireland's police force) colluded with the IRA in the killing of\ntwo senior RUC officers in 1989.^[257]^[258]^[259]^[260] The two officers were\nambushed by the IRA near Jonesborough, County Armagh, when returning from a\ncross-border security conference in Dundalk in the Republic of Ireland.^[258]\n\n## The Disappeared\n\nMain article: Disappeared (Northern Ireland)\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, republican and loyalist paramilitaries abducted a\nnumber of individuals, many alleged to have been informers, who were then\nsecretly killed and buried.^[261] Eighteen people \u2013 two women and sixteen men\n\u2013 including one British Army officer, were kidnapped and killed during the\nTroubles. They are referred to informally as \"The Disappeared\". All but one,\nLisa Dorrian, were abducted and killed by republicans. Dorrian is believed to\nhave been abducted by loyalists. The remains of all but four of \"The\nDisappeared\" have been recovered and turned over to their\nfamilies.^[262]^[263]^[264]\n\n## British Army attacks on civilians\n\nBritish government security forces, including the Military Reaction Force\n(MRF), carried out what have been described as \"extrajudicial killings\" of\nunarmed civilians.^[265]^[266]^[267] Their victims were often Catholic or\nsuspected Catholic civilians unaffiliated with any paramilitaries, such as the\nWhiterock Road shooting of two unarmed Catholic civilians by British soldiers\non 15 April 1972, and the Andersonstown shooting of seven unarmed Catholic\ncivilians on 12 May that same year.^[268] A member of the MRF stated in 1978\nthat the Army often attempted false flag sectarian attacks, provoking\nsectarian conflict and \"taking the heat off the Army\".^[269] A former member\nstated: \"[W]e were not there to act like an army unit, we were there to act\nlike a terror group.\"^[270]\n\n## Shoot-to-kill allegations\n\nMain article: Shoot-to-kill policy in Northern Ireland\n\nRepublicans allege that the security forces operated a shoot-to-kill policy\nrather than arresting IRA suspects. The security forces denied this and\npointed out that six of the eight IRA men killed in the Loughgall ambush in\n1987 were heavily armed. On the other hand, the shooting of three unarmed IRA\nmembers in Gibraltar by the Special Air Service ten months later appeared to\nconfirm suspicions among republicans and in the British and Irish media of a\ntacit British shoot-to-kill policy of suspected IRA members.^[271]\n\n## Parades issue\n\nMain articles: Parades in Northern Ireland, Drumcree conflict, and Quinn\nbrothers' killings\n\nOrangemen marching in Bangor on the Twelfth of July 2010\n\nInter-communal tensions rise and violence often breaks out during the\n\"marching season\" when the Protestant Orange Order parades take place across\nNorthern Ireland. The parades are held to commemorate William of Orange's\nvictory in the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, which secured the Protestant\nAscendancy and British rule in Ireland. One particular flashpoint which has\ncaused continuous annual strife is the Garvaghy Road area in Portadown, where\nan Orange parade from Drumcree Church passes through a mainly nationalist\nestate off the Garvaghy Road. This parade has now been banned indefinitely,\nfollowing nationalist riots against the parade and loyalist counter-riots\nagainst its banning.\n\nIn 1995, 1996, and 1997, there were several weeks of prolonged rioting\nthroughout Northern Ireland over the impasse at Drumcree. A number of people\ndied in this violence, including a Catholic taxi driver killed by the Loyalist\nVolunteer Force, and three (of four) nominally Catholic brothers (from a\nmixed-religion family) died when their house in Ballymoney was petrol-\nbombed.^[272]^[273]^[274]\n\n## Social repercussions\n\nFurther information: Paramilitary punishment attacks in Northern Ireland\n\nA watchtower at a heavily fortified RUC base in CrossmaglenA \"peace line\" at\nthe back of a house on Bombay Street, BelfastA \"peace line\" in Belfast, 2010,\nbuilt to separate nationalist and unionist neighbourhoods\n\nThe impact of the Troubles on the ordinary people of Northern Ireland has been\ncompared to that of the Blitz on the people of London.^[275] The stress\nresulting from bomb attacks, street disturbances, security checkpoints, and\nthe constant military presence had the strongest effect on children and young\nadults.^[276] There was also the fear that local paramilitaries instilled in\ntheir respective communities with the punishment beatings, \"romperings\", and\nthe occasional tarring and feathering meted out to individuals for various\npurported infractions.^[277]\n\nIn addition to the violence and intimidation, there was chronic unemployment\nand a severe housing shortage. Many people were rendered homeless as a result\nof intimidation or having their houses burnt, and urban redevelopment played a\nrole in the social upheaval. Belfast families faced being transferred to new,\nalien estates when older, decrepit districts such as Sailortown and the Pound\nLoney were being demolished. According to social worker and author Sarah\nNelson, this problem of homelessness and disorientation contributed to the\nbreakdown of the normal fabric of society, allowing for paramilitaries to\nexert a strong influence in certain districts.^[277] Vandalism was also a\nmajor problem. In the 1970s, there were 10,000 vandalised empty houses in\nBelfast alone. Most of the vandals were aged between eight and thirteen.^[278]\n\nAccording to one historian of the conflict, the stress of the Troubles\nengendered a breakdown in the previously strict sexual morality of Northern\nIreland, resulting in a \"confused hedonism\" in respect of personal life.^[279]\nIn Derry, illegitimate births and alcoholism increased for women and the\ndivorce rate rose.^[280] Teenage alcoholism was also a problem, partly as a\nresult of the drinking clubs established in both loyalist and republican\nareas. In many cases, there was little parental supervision of children in\nsome of the poorer districts.^[281] The Department of Health has looked at a\nreport written in 2007 by Mike Tomlinson of Queen's University, which asserted\nthat the legacy of the Troubles has played a substantial role in the current\nrate of suicide in Northern Ireland.^[282]\n\nFurther social issues arising from the Troubles include antisocial behavior\nand an aversion towards political participation. According to one historian,\nchildren raised during the Troubles were found to develop similar antisocial\nexternal behaviors as children similarly born in regions of conflict, notably\nthose born and raised during World War II.^[283] Further studies into the\nimpact of violence on the psychological development of children in Northern\nIreland also found that those raised during the Troubles were more likely to\nbe averse towards political participation, noting that while older generations\nstill actively associated with their own social and political groups, younger\ngenerations became wary of such groups as social and political divisions\ncontinued to expand during the thirty years of the Troubles.^[284]\n\nPeace lines, which were built in Northern Ireland during the early years of\nthe Troubles, remain in place.^[285]\n\nAccording to a 2022 poll, 69% of Irish nationalists polled believe there was\nno option but \"violent resistance to British rule during the Troubles\".^[286]\n\n## Casualties\n\nResponsibility for Troubles-related deaths between 1969 and 2001\n\nAccording to the Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN), 3,532 people were\nkilled as a result of the conflict between 1969 and 2001.^[287] Of these,\n3,489 were killed up to 1998.^[287] According to the book Lost Lives (2006\nedition), 3,720 people were killed as a result of the conflict from 1966 to\n2006. Of these, 3,635 were killed up to 1998.^[288]\n\nIn The Politics of Antagonism: Understanding Northern Ireland, Brendan O'Leary\nand John McGarry point out that \"nearly two per cent of the population of\nNorthern Ireland have been killed or injured through political violence [...]\nIf the equivalent ratio of victims to population had been produced in Great\nBritain in the same period some 100,000 people would have died, and if a\nsimilar level of political violence had taken place, the number of fatalities\nin the USA would have been over 500,000\".^[289] Using this relative comparison\nto the US, analyst John M. Gates suggests that whatever one calls the\nconflict, it was \"certainly not\" a \"low intensity conflict\".^[290]\n\nIn 2010, it was estimated that 107,000 people in Northern Ireland suffered\nsome physical injury as a result of the conflict. On the basis of data\ngathered by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency, the Victims\nCommission estimated that the conflict resulted in 500,000 'victims' in\nNorthern Ireland alone. It defines 'victims' are those who are directly\naffected by 'bereavement', 'physical injury', or 'trauma' as a result of the\nconflict.^[291]\n\n### Responsibility\n\nRepublican paramilitaries were responsible for some 60% of all deaths,\nloyalists 30% and British security forces 10%.^[39]\n\nResponsibility for killing^[39]Responsible party| No.| %  \n---|---|---  \nRepublican paramilitary groups| 2,058| 60%  \nLoyalist paramilitary groups| 1,027| 30%  \nBritish security forces| 365| 10%  \nPersons unknown| 77  \nIrish security forces| 5  \nTotal| 3,532  \n  \nLoyalists killed 48% of the civilian casualties, republicans killed 39%, and\nthe British security forces killed 10%.^[292] Most of the Catholic civilians\nwere killed by loyalists, and most of the Protestant civilians were killed by\nrepublicans.^[293]\n\nOf those killed by republican paramilitaries:^[294]\n\n  * 1,080 (~52.5%) were members/former members of the British security forces\n  * 722 (~35.1%) were civilians\n  * 188 (~9.2%) were members of republican paramilitaries\n  * 57 (~2.8%) were members of loyalist paramilitaries\n  * 11 (~0.5%) were members of the Irish security forces\n\nOf those killed by loyalist paramilitaries:^[294]\n\n  * 878 (~85.5%) were civilians\n  * 94 (~9.2%) were members of loyalist paramilitaries\n  * 41 (~4.0%) were members of republican paramilitaries\n  * 14 (~1.4%) were members of the British security forces\n\nOf those killed by British security forces:^[294]\n\n  * 188 (~51.5%) were civilians\n  * 146 (~40.2%) were members of republican paramilitaries\n  * 18 (~5.0%) were members of loyalist paramilitaries\n  * 13 (~3.6%) were fellow members of the British security forces\n\n### Status\n\nApproximately 52% of the dead were civilians, 32% were members or former\nmembers of the British security forces, 11% were members of republican\nparamilitaries, and 5% were members of loyalist paramilitaries.^[39] About 60%\nof the civilian casualties were Catholics, 30% of the civilians were\nProtestants, and the rest were from outside Northern Ireland.^[295]\n\nAbout 257 of those killed were children under the age of seventeen,\nrepresenting 7.2% of the total,^[296] while 274 children under the age of\neighteen were killed during the conflict.^[297]\n\nIt has been the subject of dispute whether some individuals were members of\nparamilitary organisations. Several casualties that were listed as civilians\nwere later claimed by the IRA as their members.^[298] One Ulster Defence\nAssociation (UDA) and three Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) members killed during\nthe conflict were also Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) soldiers at the time of\ntheir deaths.^[299] At least one civilian victim was an off-duty member of the\nTerritorial Army.^[300]\n\nDeaths by status of victim^[9]Status| No.  \n---|---  \nCivilians (inc.
