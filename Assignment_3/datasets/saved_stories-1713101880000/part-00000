Even now, nearly a decade into living with\nwatches that are also wallets, I still get a little techy satisfaction any\ntime I pay for something using my Pixel Watch. But as much as I appreciate the\nability to use my wrist computer to pay for coffee, I think the Google Wallet\nexperience on Wear OS could be significantly improved with what seems to me\nlike a simple UX tweak.\n\n## Let us pay without opening the app\n\n### It's less secure, but not by much\n\nAs it stands today, buying something with Google Wallet on Wear OS requires\nyou to open the Google Wallet app before tapping your watch to a contactless\npayment terminal. Different watches work differently, but in the case of the\nPixel Watch 2 I'm typically wearing, you can most easily fire up Wallet by\ndouble-tapping the watch's digital crown. Once it's open, tap-to-pay is ready.\nAll told, it's hardly an inconvenient system as is.\n\nBut having to get the app open first introduces just a little extra friction\nthat makes the experience feel less seamless than it could. On mobile,\nprovided you have a default card set in Wallet and aren't using the Pixel 7\nPro's wonky face unlock feature, tapping your unlocked phone to a payment\nterminal will initiate a payment with your default method, whether or not you\nhave the Wallet app open. Essentially, I want to see that approach on Wear OS,\ntoo.\n\nRelated\n\n##### How and if you can add your state identification to Google Wallet\n\nA digital ID is convenient to have if you can use one\n\nThat may sound risky, but hear me out. Just like on a phone, using Google\nWallet on Wear OS requires that your watch has a screen lock set. Once you've\nunlocked your watch, it stays unlocked until you take it off, at which time it\nimmediately locks again. Having to manually open Wallet before making a\npayment does further mitigate some risks, like making a tap-to-pay payment you\ndidn't intend to or having your payment information read without your\npermission by nearby bad actors. But given NFC in smartwatches only has a\nrange of a couple of inches, I feel those threats are very remote.\n\nPersonally, I'd be willing to chance it for the option to use tap-to-pay any\ntime my watch is unlocked. Physical credit cards have no payment method-side\nauthentication for contactless payments at all, so compared to that, my watch\nlocking when it's off my wrist already feels plenty secure without the\nadditional step of opening Google Wallet first.\n\n## Make it an option, not the default\n\n### I just want a toggle\n\nIn light of NFC's range limitations and Google Wallet's inherent security \u2014\nthe digital cards on your watch have numbers unique from your physical cards \u2014\nI feel like the risk in allowing easier contactless payments on Wear OS would\nbe pretty minimal. Still, I'd be perfectly happy to see what I'm proposing\nhere as an option while the status quo stays the default. Heck, Google could\neven throw in a strongly worded warning when you change the setting.\n\nAs it stands, though, using Google Wallet on your watch takes two hands, which\nruns counter to the purpose of a feature that should be all about convenience.\nYou can fish a phone out of your pocket, unlock it, and tap it to a card\nreader all without setting down your coffee (or your shopping bags, or your\nchild, et cetera) \u2014 but one-handed payments aren't possible on Wear OS. It's a\nniche complaint, but I'd love to see it addressed, even if recent changes\nabroad make it seem like Google is increasingly prioritizing security over\nflexibility when it comes to payments.\n\nRelated\n\n##### Google Wallet's tap-to-pay needs to be as simple as it is with my credit\ncard\n\nSecurity by default is good, but what I want is old-school Android flexibility\n\nReaders like you help support Android Police.
