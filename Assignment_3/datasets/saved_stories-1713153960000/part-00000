Dalton Caldwell and Michael Seibel discuss the\ntypes of ideas to stay away from \u2014 what we commonly refer to as \"tarpit\nideas.\"\n\nWhat is a \u201ctarpit idea\u201d?\n\nThese are the startup ideas that seem good \u2014 almost too good to be true! \u2014 but\nhave been tried by many founders before with little to no success.\n\nTarpit ideas are often not hard in obvious ways. They might seem so easy and\ngood that it\u2019s unbelievable that no one has done it \u2014 but when you look a bit\ndeeper, you realize that they have been tried. Over, and over again.\n\nWhy is it called a \u201ctarpit\u201d?\n\nIt\u2019s a nod to the petroleum tar pits that paleontologists love to explore\nbecause they\u2019re a good place to find fossils.\n\nAnimals would confuse the shiny tar for fresh water and try to take a drink...\nonly to fall in, get stuck, and meet their demise. Worse yet: the smell of\ntheir body would attract other animals who\u2019d meet the same fate!\n\nHow can I avoid tarpit ideas?\n\nIf your idea has been tried before, do your research and understand why it\ndidn\u2019t work. Assume the founders who tried before were very smart, very\ndetermined people; what\u2019s different now?\n\n## Footer\n\nY Combinator\n\n### Programs\n\n  * YC Program\n  * Startup School\n  * Work at a Startup\n  * Co-Founder Matching\n\n### Company\n\n  * YC Blog\n  * Contact\n  * Press\n  * People\n  * Careers\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Notice at Collection\n  * Security\n  * Terms of Use\n\n### Resources\n\n  * Startup Directory\n  * Startup Library\n  * Investors\n  * SAFE\n  * Hacker News\n  * Launch YC\n  * YC Deals\n\n### Make something people want.\n\nApply\n\nTwitterFacebookInstagramLinkedInYoutube\n\n\u00a9 2024 Y Combinator\n\n", "frontpage": false}
