The Apple-centric reporter was told by insiders\nthat three distinct Apple M4 processors have been prepared. Interestingly, the\nnew silicon is designed to revamp the Mac computer line with a new AI focus \u2013\naddressing an IT industry trend where Apple is clearly lagging.\n\nGurman explains that Mac computers haven\u2019t enjoyed the most buoyant sales in\nrecent months. Machine sales saw a 27% drop in sales during the last fiscal\nyear, and the tepid critical response to the new M3 computers was a sign that\nthe move from M2 to M3 wasn\u2019t enough to entice customers to part with their\nhard-earned cash.\n\nWith the IT industry riding waves of enthusiasm for all things AI, even if\nconsumers are yet to be convinced of its on-device merits, Apple probably\nhopes that adding an AI focus to its M4 processors / marketing will help\nprovide an uplift.\n\n## Donan, Brava, and Hidra\n\nThe Bloomberg report highlights three Apple M4 chip codenames, but we don\u2019t\nhave much in the way of hard specs, sadly. Gurman\u2019s sources say that the\nentry-level M4 chip will be codenamed Donan. A more powerful SoC named Brava\nwill address the mid-range market. Meanwhile, the Apple M4 Hidra will be the\ntop-end SoC of the next generation. These three products look set to fill the\nroles of the M4, M4 Pro and M4 Max, perhaps.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware\n\nSo, Donan, Brava, and Hidra will undoubtedly deliver a step up in performance\nvs their M3 brethren, but we have no idea how much better they will be. With\nthe AI-focus, you might expect a lot more dedicated processing to accelerate\nAI. However, Apple already introduced a \u201cpowerful\u201d 16-core Neural Engine\noffering 18 TOPS with the M3 range (60% faster than M1 chips could manage).\nFew people may be using that built-in processing on the Mac day-to-day right\nnow, though, and the M4\u2019s presumably strengthened Neural Engine should have\nmore to do if the insider-based info from Bloomberg is correct.\n\n(Image credit: Apple)\n\nWhether more AI processing power (and marketing) can make a difference to the\ndeceleration of Mac sales remains to be seen. Gurman says that the M4 chips\nwill permeate the full Mac lineup from \u201cnew iMacs, a low-end 14-inch MacBook\nPro, high-end 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros, and Mac minis.\u201d Though, this\nis no surprise. Hopefully, more direction and compelling AI application\nplanning will be evident during the Apple WWDC, which kicks off on June 10.\n\nWhatever happens, Apple\u2019s competitors haven\u2019t let their foot off the AI\nacceleration pedal for months. We also have exciting new chips like \u201c100+\nTOPS\u201d Lunar Lake and the \u201cbreakthrough\u201d Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite to look\nforward to later this year.\n\n## Stay on the Cutting Edge\n\nJoin the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC\ntech news \u2014 and have for over 25 years.

A new\nprocessor with AI is unlikely to entice more people to buy, especially if they\nraise prices. Apple should be looking at reducing cost/price if they want to\ngain more sales.\n\nReply\n\n  * Findecanor\n\nWith \"GHz\" and \"number of cores\", people can infer that higher numbers means\nthat their programs run faster. And with more \"shader units\", people can infer\nthat they'd get higher frame rate/resolution in games.\n\nHowever, \"TOPS\" is not a measurement that drives sales. It is not directly\nconnected to anything that people care about. To make that happen, you would\nneed applications whose performance depends on the size of the TPU, and that\ndoes not exist in the consumer space today. The \"AI\" that people know about\nare on black-box servers in the \"cloud\".\n\nReply\n\n##### Most Popular\n\nAMD quietly confirms worldwide launch for Ryzen 7 8700F, Ryzen 5 8400F \u2014\nofficial specs revealed\n\nMinisforum releases its first portable monitor \u2014 15.6-inch, 144 Hz, 1440p for\n$189\n\nBlacklisted Huawei unveils new Intel-powered notebooks \u2014 MateBook X Pro comes\narmed with latest Core Ultra inside\n\nEngineer creates CPU from scratch in two weeks \u2014 begins work on GPUs\n\nIntel's Gaudi 3 is coming to China: But what about AMD's MI300 and Nvidia's\nB100/B200?\n\nAI may eventually consume a quarter of America's power by 2030, warns Arm CEO\n\nCustomer RMAs Inno3D RTX 4070 Ti but allegedly receives cheaper Dell RTX 3050\nin return \u2014 accuses Overclockers UK for scam\n\nIntel axes 13th Gen Core i5, i7, i9 K-series CPUs \u2014 lineup will be\ndiscontinued by May 24th 2024\n\nAMD Instinct MI350 with upgraded 4nm process node and HBM3E may launch later\nthis year, according to analyst firm\n\nDRAM pricing and supply seems largely unaffected by Taiwan earthquake, firm\nclaims\n\nRaspberry Pi 5 challenger LattePanda Mu uses Intel N100 CPU to take on\nindustry-leading single-board computer\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and\nleading digital publisher.
