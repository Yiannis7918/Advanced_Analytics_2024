That construction was only formulated abstractly in\n> mathematics in the 19th century--even though DEB had been used in the\n> business world for over five centuries. Yet the connection between DEB and\n> the group of differences (here called the \"Pacioli group\") is still largely\n> unknown both in mathematics and accounting. The precise mathematical\n> treatment of DEB allows clarity on certain conceptual questions and it\n> immediately yields the generalization of the double-entry method to multi-\n> dimensional vectors typically representing the different types of property\n> involved in an enterprise or household.\n\nSubjects:| History and Overview (math.HO)  \n---|---  \nMSC classes:| 00  \nCite as:| arXiv:1407.1898 [math.HO]  \n(or arXiv:1407.1898v1 [math.HO] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1407.1898arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: David Ellerman [view email] [v1] Mon, 7 Jul 2014 22:03:54 UTC (107 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled On Double-Entry Bookkeeping: The Mathematical\nTreatment, by David Ellerman\n\n  * View PDF\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\nmath.HO\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 1407\n\nChange to browse by:\n\nmath\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
