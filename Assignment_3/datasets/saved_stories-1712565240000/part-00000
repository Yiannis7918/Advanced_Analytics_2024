The creatures experience acute physical effects from short-term exposure to suspended sediment, which could be caused by deep-sea mining. | Helena Hauss\n\nBy Elizabeth Beattie Staff writer\n\nSHARE\n\nTwitter Facebook LinkedIn Email Print\n\nApr 7, 2024\n\nThe supple little creatures look like ghosts as they wriggle around in the\ndarkness. When they move closer into frame, it\u2019s almost as if they\u2019re flashing\ngoofy grins for the camera.\n\nWhile scientists once believed it was impossible for fish to survive in the\npunishing conditions below 8,200 meters, the snailfish, which resides some\n8,336 meters underwater and was captured on video by researchers during a 2022\nexpedition in the Izu-Ogasawara trench southeast of Japan, reinforced just how\nmuch life exists deep below the surface \u2014 and how little we know about it.\n\nIn a way that hidden things often do, deep-sea fish fascinate us. Deep-sea\nfish, with their alien forms, are, all at once, terrifying, beautiful and\nmysterious. These fish are, in their own way, brilliant organic forms,\nwithstanding tons of pressure (in some places the equivalent force of 100\nadult elephants standing on someone\u2019s head). Yet somehow the soft, intricate\nbodies are able to thrive under these conditions.\n\nAt the Numazu Deep Sea Aquarium in Shizuoka Prefecture, which purports to be\nthe world\u2019s first museum centered on deep-sea species that live more than 200\nmeters below the sea surface, there is an array of different underwater worlds\non display. This attracts large weekend crowds who peer through little glassy\nwindows at slices of habitats typically out of human view \u2014 a world where\ncreatures glow underwater and scuttle across seabed floors.\n\nBut this world may be under threat, as demand for metals such as lithium and\nnickel \u2014 used in the production of smartphones, batteries and military\nweaponry \u2014 has driven a rush to take a stake in the seabed, with Japan being a\nmajor advocate of deep-sea mining.\n\n### Deep-sea landscape\n\nThe ocean covers around 70% of the Earth\u2019s surface with an average depth of\n3,682 meters, but relatively little is known about it. There are estimated to\nbe somewhere between 700,000 and 1 million different species in the ocean,\nwith almost 2,000 new underwater species accepted by the scientific community\neach year, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration.\n\nA frozen specimen of a coelacanth at the Numazu Deep Sea Aquarium in Numazu, Shizuoka Prefecture, on March 31 | Elizabeth Beattie\n\nWhile underwater conditions are extreme, many deep-sea creatures are able to\nsurvive through a symbiotic relationship with their ecosystems. As sunlight\ncannot penetrate the ocean depths, hydrothermal vents, deep below the water\u2019s\nsurface, jet up energy from cracks in the seafloor. While these vents are\nimmensely hot and have a high pressure, the surrounding areas are home to a\nvariety of unique undersea life, from worms to crabs.\n\nBut the chemical-rich patches of water around the vents are attractive for\ndeep-sea mining \u2014 which the International Union for Conservation of Nature\n(IUCN) defines as the removal of minerals and metals at depths of more than\n200 meters \u2014 as countries look to strengthen and take greater control of their\nsupply chains.\n\nJapan, which is reliant on mineral imports, has over the years looked to deep-\nsea mining as part of a national security push and as a means to being more\nself-sufficient. The country has already carried out numerous tests.\n\nIn 2020, using a Japan-built crust-excavation testing machine, the Japan\nOrganization for Metals and Energy Security (JOGMEC) harvested 649 kilograms\nof cobalt and nickel-rich seabed crust. It is thought that the test area\ncontains enough cobalt to meet Japan\u2019s demand for 88 years and enough nickel\nto meet its demand for 12 years.\n\nBut academics in the country have warned of the potential for environmental\nharm. The mining extraction process and destruction of key hydrothermal vents\ncould affect those hundreds of kilometers away, according to research by\nacademics at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology, while analysis\nof seabed ecology undertaken following the 2020 drilling by JOGMEC showed a\ndecrease in marine life such as fish and shrimp at the site a year on.\n\nA preserved specimen on display at the Numazu Deep Sea Aquarium in Numazu on March 31 | Elizabeth Beattie\n\nIn November 2023, Vanessa Stenvers, a doctoral researcher at the GEOMAR\nHelmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel, and Henk-Jan Hoving, the working\ngroup leader on deep-sea biology at the same institution, published a paper\ndetailing their finding that a representative organism, the helmet jellyfish,\nexperienced acute physical effects from short-term exposure to suspended\nsediment, which could be caused by mining.\n\nStenvers says that when it comes to deep-sea mining, \u201cmost research available\nhas focused on animals living on the seafloor, which is where the impact will\nbe direct.\u201d But as the process involves sediment being moved around the ocean\nfloor and being pumped back into the water, the impact will extend beyond,\nposing a risk to other deep-sea creatures too.\n\n\u201cYou have these very delicate animals with gelatinous tissues, or filter-\nfeeding lifestyles, or they create mucus to capture their food, so the\nhypothesized impacts could be large, which is what we showed in our paper,\u201d\nStenvers says, noting that in addition to noise and light pollution and other\nstressors, \u201csediment plumes will not only affect the animal directly ... but\nalso indirectly, for instance, visual communications \u2014 there's a lot of\nbioluminescence in the deep sea.\u201d\n\nJapanese politicians have expressed awareness of the potential impacts. In a\nFebruary meeting with International Seabed Authority (ISA) Secretary-General\nMichael Lodge, Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa spoke about \u201cthe importance of\nthe development of regulations on the exploitation of mineral resources ...\nthat take into account both conservation of the marine environment and use of\nmarine resources in activities\u201d and \u201cemphasized that Japan will contribute\nconstructively to the discussion,\u201d according to a ministry readout.\n\n### Big decisions\n\nPradeep Singh, lead of a deep-seabed mining ecosystems specialist group at the\nIUCN, says there is still too little information when it comes to deep-sea\nmining and its risks for informed decisions to be made on the political level.\nAt the same time, there is much scientific research suggesting a concerning\noutcome, he says.\n\n\u201cWhat we do know is that the implications of deep-seabed mining are going to\nbe quite severe. Science is already able to say (we should) be prepared for\nlarge-scale devastation, particularly on the seabed,\u201d Singh says, noting that\nthere would be further impacts from other aspects of the process, including\nthe discharge of waste following processing on board.\n\nA helmet jellyfish collected with a remotely operated vehicle in the North Pacific Ocean | Vanessa Stenvers\n\nAdvocates of deep-sea mining have argued that it will help with the transition\naway from fossil fuels, with minerals necessary for technologies such as\nbatteries and solar panels waiting to be extracted from far below the waves.\nThey have also argued that on-land mining is more harmful, impacting\nIndigenous people and rainforests, but not everyone is convinced.\n\nThe economics of deep-sea mining are uncertain, but if it does end up being\ncheaper than on-land mining, that could lead to an intensification of the\nlatter.\n\n\u201cWe'll just have more of the same old problems we see on land, but new\nproblems at sea,\u201d Singh says.\n\nInternational bodies and countries have also expressed their concerns, echoing\nscientists. Indeed, a 2020 resolution on deep-seabed mining by the IUCN \u2014 14%\nof whose members are state or government agencies \u2014 called for a moratorium on\ndeep-seabed mining and the issuing of new exploitation and new exploration\ncontracts until \u201cthe environmental, social, cultural and economic risks of\ndeep-seabed mining are comprehensively understood\u201d and \u201cpolicies to ensure the\nresponsible production and use of metals\u201d are implemented.\n\nAnd in February, the European Union parliament rebuked Norway for its green-\nlighting of deep-sea mining the previous month.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the ISA, which oversees the deep sea and its mineral\nresources, has not yet finalized rules for the practice.\n\nA Rhinopias scorpion fish swims around an artificial habitat at the Numazu Deep Sea Aquarium in Numazu on March 31. The fish is known for its stealthy camouflage flits. | Elizabeth Beattie\n\nStill, the ISA has entered into contracts for deep-sea exploration for a range\nof metals with a number of companies, including JOGMEC. Lodge said in February\nthat it \u201cseems to be inevitable\u201d that countries will begin deep-sea mining,\nalthough the timeline for when that could happen remains unclear.\n\nWith milestones like the development of regulations and processes still not\nagreed upon, some experts, such as Singh, believe that deep-sea mining may\nactually be some way off.\n\nIn the meantime, the argument for avoiding deep-sea mining altogether has\ngained broader traction amid the development of electric vehicle batteries\nbased on alternative minerals, with sodium replacing lithium.\n\n### What lies beneath\n\nThe creatures that inhabit the deep sea are of interest to research for a\nplethora of reasons and could offer all manner of insights, says Hoving.\n\n\u201cThere is an incredibly unexplored reservoir of biodiversity in the deep\nocean. These animals have evolved all these unique characteristics under\nunique selective pressures that we don't know much about,\u201d he says.\n\nA helmet jellyfish in an experimental tank. The photo was taken under red light, as helmet jellyfish are highly sensitive to bright light. | Vanessa Stenvers\n\nLessons from their chemicals to biomimicry mechanisms could have applications\non land.\n\n\u201cThere are all these organisms, but we can't learn from them if we don't know\nthat they exist,\u201d he says, noting \u201cthe deep sea has a fundamental role in our\nlife on Earth. We need to inform ourselves before we start exploiting it,\nbecause as soon as we start disturbing it, without any prior knowledge,\nreturning it to its original pristine state is exceptionally hard.\u201d\n\nWhile Stenvers says we typically think of deep-sea fish as strange alien-like\ncreatures, given their populations and diversity, perhaps they are not the\nstrange ones.\n\n\u201cThey are actually much more abundant on Earth than we are,\u201d she says. \"So who\nreally are the alien inhabitants?\"\n\n### KEYWORDS\n\nfish(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/fish),\nmining(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/mining),\nminerals(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/minerals),\noceans(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/oceans),\nenvironment(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/environment),\nanimals(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/animals)\n\nIn a time of both misinformation and too much information, quality journalism\nis more crucial than ever.
