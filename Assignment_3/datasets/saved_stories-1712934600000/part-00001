Often, it takes place right\nbefore a minimum interval takeoff.\n\n## Origins[edit]\n\nThe term elephant walk dates to World War II when large fleets of allied\nbombers would conduct attacks in missions containing 1,000 aircraft. Those who\nobserved this said that the taxiing of these large numbers of aircraft to take\noff in single file in nose-to-tail formations said that they looked like\nelephants walking to the next watering hole. Over time, it was incorporated\ninto the lexicon of the United States Air Force to identify a \"maximum sortie\nsurge\".^[1]^[2]\n\n## Tactical use[edit]\n\nThe benefits of an elephant walk include being able to show the capability of\nthe units as well as teamwork. It is often performed to prepare squadrons for\nwartime operations and to prepare pilots for the launching of fully armed\naircraft in one mass event.^[2]\n\n## Other uses[edit]\n\nDuring Operations Linebacker and Linebacker II during the Vietnam War, the\nterm was used as a nickname for the long lines of Boeing B-52 Stratofortress\naircraft as they approached their targets.^[3] Although the tight groupings\nwere necessary for electronic warfare, their paths were predictable and they\nwere slow targets for North Vietnamese surface-to-air missiles. Within two\nweeks,^[clarification needed] the Air Force altered its tactics and began to\nvary the incoming paths of bombers. In addition to changing this aspect of the\nattack, the bombers were told to take longer turns after discharging their\nload, instead of the sharp turn which gave them greater radar exposure.^[3]\nThe practice is also used by some aerobatic teams, particularly those\nassociated with a military branch such as the Blue Angels or Thunderbirds of\nthe United States and Canada's Snowbirds, with the teams' aircraft taxiing in\ntight formation to the runway and maintaining such grouping during takeoff.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Couse-Baker, Robert. \"Travis aircraft - all lined up for \"elephant walk\"\". 349th Air Mobility Wing Public Affairs Office.
