They were just at risk of pissing off the\nshareholders'\n\nNews\n\nBy Ted Litchfield\n\npublished 6 April 2024\n\n\"We should be humbled by this period. It doesn't feel like we're humbled by\nthis period as an industry.\"\n\n(Image credit: Larian)\n\nSpeaking with Game File (users will encounter a paywall) at the Game\nDevelopers Choice Awards, Larian director of publishing Michael Douse gave his\ntake on the current state of the industry, including some sharp criticism on\nthe wave after wave of mass layoffs we've been seeing.\n\n\"They are an avoidable fuck-up,\" Douse said. \"That's all they really are.\nThat's why you see one after the other. Because companies are going: 'Well,\nfinally. Now we can, too. We've wanted to do it for ages. Everyone else is. So\nwhy don't we?' That's really kind of sick.\"\n\nThough Douse allowed that big publishers are complicated operations that can't\nreact quickly to new demands or market changes, he argued that better planning\nand leadership could have prevented the worst of what we're seeing, and\nexpressed frustration with how the industry continues with its business as\nusual in glitzy events like the GDC Awards or BAFTAs: \"We should be humbled by\nthis period. It doesn't feel like we're humbled by this period as an\nindustry.\"\n\nHe also pointed out that there's an issue of competing incentives for publicly\ntraded game companies, with concerns over stock price coming at the expense of\nboth players and developers: \"None of these companies are at risk of going\nbankrupt,\" Douse said. \"They're just at risk of pissing off the shareholders.\nAnd that's fine. That's how they work. The function of a public company is to\ncreate growth for its shareholders... It's not to make a happy climate for the\nemployees.\"\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM pcgamer\n\nDouse pointed to Swen Vincke's leadership, as well as Larian's ability to make\nrisky moves unbeholden to shareholders, as major reasons for the company's\nsuccess in recent years. Bloomberg's Jason Schreier argued a similar point in\nan op-ed back around Baldur's Gate 3's release.\n\nThough Douse acknowledged that the final decision would always be up to\nVincke, he said that going public would likely never be the move for Larian:\n\"Creating the games that we wanted to make, going public might give us more\nmoney, but it would be antithetical to the quality part of what we're trying\nto do. So it wouldn't make our games better. It would just make us rushed.\"\n\nYou can check out the conversation in full by subscribing to Game File, the\nnewsletter of former Kotaku editor in chief Stephen Totilo. Douse and Totilo\nalso discussed how Steam and social media have changed the way games are sold,\nthat consoles are still playing catch-up with PC in that area, and how early\naccess is the way to go for Larian\u2014Douse noted that Larian's \"whatever the\nnext thing will be\" will likely follow Original Sin 2 and Baldur's Gate 3's\nrelease model.\n\n## PC Gamer Newsletter\n\nSign up to get the best content of the week, and great gaming deals, as picked\nby the editors.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nTed Litchfield\n\nAssociate Editor\n\nTed has been thinking about PC games and bothering anyone who would listen\nwith his thoughts on them ever since he booted up his sister's copy of\nNeverwinter Nights on the family computer.
