(Congrats to the South Carolina women and UConn men, both of whom\nwon championships convincingly.) The gist of the commercial is that you\nshouldn\u2019t worry about deleting photos to free up storage, because modern\niPhones have plenty of space. The commercial-ending tagline as our protagonist\nstops deleting photos and resumes shooting new ones of his adorable dog: \u201cLots\nof storage for lots of photos / Relax it\u2019s iPhone 15\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s true that the iPhones 15, 14, and 13 all start with 128 GB of storage,\nwhich I think is the perfect baseline storage capacity. Only the so-old-it-\nstill-has-a-home-button 3rd-gen iPhone SE starts at 64 GB. Especially when\nyou\u2019re talking about photos \u2014 which is what this commercial is about \u2014 128 GB\nis a lot of on-device storage.\n\nBut this commercial made me want to yell at my TV each time it came on: \u201cThe\nproblem is iCloud storage, not on-device storage!\u201d The free tier of iCloud\nremains just 5 GB, and the $1/month paid tier offers just 50 GB, which may not\nbe enough to back up even a 64 GB iPhone SE. I\u2019m an outlier \u2014 660 GB in iCloud\nPhotos alone \u2014 but my wife, a casual/occasional photographer, has 55 GB in\niCloud Photos. Even people who don\u2019t shoot many photos in a year can wind up\nwith large photo libraries because they\u2019ve been using iPhones for 10\u201315 years.\n\nI\u2019d much rather have constrained storage on-device, with ample storage online,\nthan the other way around. iOS does a great job in this situation with the (on\nby default) \u201cOptimize iPhone Storage\u201d option in Settings \u2192 Photos. But the\nother way around is surely the situation for many, if not most, iPhone users:\nmore space on device than storage in iCloud. And no amount of cleverness in\niOS can protect a user with un-backed-up photos and videos if they lose or\nbreak their iPhone.\n\nAm I missing something? It feels like this new commercial is just whistling\npast the single biggest shortcoming in the Apple ecosystem.\n\n\u2605 Tuesday, 9 April 2024\n\nDisplay Preferences\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2002\u20132024 The Daring Fireball Company LLC.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
