Each was presented with a series of 87 patient\nscenarios involving a specific eye problem, and asked to give a diagnosis or\nadvise on treatment by selecting from four options.\n\nGPT-4 scored significantly better in the test than unspecialised junior\ndoctors, who are comparable to general practitioners in their level of\nspecialist eye knowledge.\n\nGPT-4 gained similar scores to trainee and expert eye doctors - although the\ntop performing doctors scored higher.\n\nThe researchers say that large language models aren\u2019t likely to replace\nhealthcare professionals, but have the potential to improve healthcare as part\nof the clinical workflow.\n\nThey say state-of-the-art large language models like GPT-4 could be useful for\nproviding eye-related advice, diagnosis, and management suggestions in well-\ncontrolled contexts, like triaging patients, or where access to specialist\nhealthcare professionals is limited.\n\n\u201cWe could realistically deploy AI in triaging patients with eye issues to\ndecide which cases are emergencies that need to be seen by a specialist\nimmediately, which can be seen by a GP, and which don\u2019t need treatment,\u201d said\nDr Arun Thirunavukarasu, lead author of the study, which he carried out while\na student at the University of Cambridge\u2019s School of Clinical Medicine.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe models could follow clear algorithms already in use, and we\u2019ve\nfound that GPT-4 is as good as expert clinicians at processing eye symptoms\nand signs to answer more complicated questions.\n\n\u201cWith further development, large language models could also advise GPs who are\nstruggling to get prompt advice from eye doctors. People in the UK are waiting\nlonger than ever for eye care.\n\nLarge volumes of clinical text are needed to help fine-tune and develop these\nmodels, and work is ongoing around the world to facilitate this.\n\nThe researchers say that their study is superior to similar, previous studies\nbecause they compared the abilities of AI to practicing doctors, rather than\nto sets of examination results.\n\n\u201cDoctors aren't revising for exams for their whole career. We wanted to see\nhow AI fared when pitted against to the on-the-spot knowledge and abilities of\npracticing doctors, to provide a fair comparison,\u201d said Thirunavukarasu, who\nis now an Academic Foundation Doctor at Oxford University Hospitals NHS\nFoundation Trust.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe also need to characterise the capabilities and limitations of\ncommercially available models, as patients may already be using them - rather\nthan the internet - for advice.\u201d\n\nThe test included questions about a huge range of eye problems, including\nextreme light sensitivity, decreased vision, lesions, itchy and painful eyes,\ntaken from a textbook used to test trainee eye doctors. This textbook is not\nfreely available on the internet, making it unlikely that its content was\nincluded in GPT-4\u2019s training datasets.\n\nThe results are published today in the journal PLOS Digital Health.\n\n\u201cEven taking the future use of AI into account, I think doctors will continue\nto be in charge of patient care. The most important thing is to empower\npatients to decide whether they want computer systems to be involved or not.\nThat will be an individual decision for each patient to make,\u201d said\nThirunavukarasu.\n\nGPT-4 and GPT-3.5 \u2013 or \u2018Generative Pre-trained Transformers\u2019 - are trained on\ndatasets containing hundreds of billions of words from articles, books, and\nother internet sources. These are two examples of large language models;\nothers in wide use include Pathways Language Model 2 (PaLM 2) and Large\nLanguage Model Meta AI 2 (LLaMA 2).\n\nThe study also tested GPT-3.5, PaLM2, and LLaMA with the same set of\nquestions. GPT-4 gave more accurate responses than all of them.\n\nGPT-4 powers the online chatbot ChatGPT to provide bespoke responses to human\nqueries. In recent months, ChatGPT has attracted significant attention in\nmedicine for attaining passing level performance in medical school\nexaminations, and providing more accurate and empathetic messages than human\ndoctors in response to patient queries.\n\nThe field of artificially intelligent large language models is moving very\nrapidly. Since the study was conducted, more advanced models have been\nreleased - which may be even closer to the level of expert eye doctors.\n\nReference: Thirunavukarasu, A J et al: \u2018Large language models approach expert-\nlevel clinical knowledge and reasoning in ophthalmology: A head-to-head cross-\nsectional study.\u2019 PLOS Digital Health, April 2024.
