Sarah Drasner, in her excellent\nbook Engineering Management for the Rest of Us, refers to this as\n\"interuption-driven work\".\n\nThat was a new label for me - and it struck a nerve. She's absolutely right.\nAnd this was in the first paragraph of the first chapter in her book -\nseriously - go read it!\n\nWhen you become a manager, the point of your role is not to do things, but\nrather to get others to do things and do it as well as they can. Because of\nthat your focus will have to shift to solving problems so that your team is\nunblocked and can do their job.\n\n  * Weird API question? You have to look into it.\n  * Feature no one knows about? You have to document it.\n  * Complaint from a stakeholder? You have to investigate it.\n\nNow, sure you will (hopefully) delegate aspects of these distractions to your\nteam to help solve - but they will hit you first.\n\nAnd that is as it should be - hopefully you can be the receiver of all of the\nrandom distractions so that you can at least triage them and put them into\nyour normal ways of working, so that your team can work in the ways that they\nexpect to and do their best work. That's the dream, anyway.\n\nSo, yeah, as you become a manger - set your expectations accordingly. You're\nnow a distraction filter.\n\nTags: management\n\nPrevious: How I learned to code: the art of letting go\n\nHello! I\u2019m Chip. Chip Cullen.
