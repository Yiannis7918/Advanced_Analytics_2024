It allows for a compact proof of\nmembership and, in the case of a universal accumulator, non-membership of an\nelement x in the data structure. A dynamic accumulator, furthermore, allows\nelements to be added to and deleted from the accumulator. Previously known\nRSA-based dynamic accumulators were too slow in practice because they required\nthat an element in the domain be represented as a prime number. Accumulators\nbased on settings other than RSA had other drawbacks such as requiring a\nprohibitively large common reference string or a trapdoor, or not permitting\ndeletions. In this paper, we construct RSA-based dynamic universal\naccumulators that do not require that the accumulated elements be represented\nas primes. We also show how to aggregate membership and non-membership\nwitnesses and batch additions and deletions. We demonstrate that the\nefficiency gains compared to previously known RSA-based accumulators are\nsubstantial, and, for the first time, make cryptographic accumulators a viable\ncandidate for a certificate revocation mechanism as part of a WebPKI-type\nsystem.\n\n##### Metadata\n\nAvailable format(s)\n\n    PDF\nCategory\n\n    Public-key cryptography\nPublication info\n\n    Preprint.\nKeywords\n\n    RSA AccumulatorCryptographic AccumulatorVDFWebPKI\nContact author(s)\n\n    vyoudomk @ cs brown edu anna @ cs brown edu\nHistory\n\n    2024-04-15: revised\n    2024-03-29: received\n    See all versions\nShort URL\n\n    https://ia.cr/2024/505\nLicense\n\n    CC BY\n\nBibTeX\n\n    \n    \n    @misc{cryptoeprint:2024/505, author = {Victor Youdom Kemmoe and Anna Lysyanskaya}, title = {RSA-Based Dynamic Accumulator without Hashing into Primes}, howpublished = {Cryptology ePrint Archive, Paper 2024/505}, year = {2024}, note = {\\url{https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/505}}, url = {https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/505} }\n\nNote: In order to protect the privacy of readers, eprint.iacr.org does not use\ncookies or embedded third party content.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
