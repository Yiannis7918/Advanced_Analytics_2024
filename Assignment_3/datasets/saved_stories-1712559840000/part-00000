Across four episodes, the story of the ticking-\nclock of Columbia's final mission is told in dramatic detail, beginning months\nbefore the troubled launch, unfolding across the sixteen days in orbit, and\nconcluding with the investigation into the tragic loss of the seven\nastronauts' lives. Weaving together intimate footage shot by the astronauts\nthemselves inside the orbiter, exclusive first-hand testimony from family\nmembers of the Shuttle's crew, key players at NASA \u2014 some of whom have never\nspoken before \u2014 and journalists who covered the story on the ground, the\nseries paints an intimate portrait of the women and men onboard and uncovers\nin forensic detail the trail of events and missed opportunities that\nultimately led to disaster. CNN says the first two episodes will livestream\ntonight at 9 p.m. EST (time-delayed on the west coast until 9 p.m.PST) \u2014 and\nthen be available on-demand starting Monday \u2014 \"for pay TV subscribers via\nCNN.com, CNN connected TV and mobile apps.\" CNN's web site offers a \"preview\"\nof its live TV offerings here.\n\nThey're promising \"the inside story of one America's most iconic institutions,\nuncovering how financial pressures and a culture of complacency may have\ncontributed to the events of February 1, 2003. The series also reflects on the\nlegacy of the Space Shuttle era, serving as a timely exploration of the\nchallenges and inherent dangers that remain relevant to space travel today.\"\n\nOn its web site CNN has also published two companion articles \u2014 one by Rice\nhistory professor Douglas Brinkley arguing that NASA \"was America's crown\njewel. After the Columbia disaster it was never quite the same.\" Because other\nshuttle missions had returned safely with \"shredded\" surface tiles \u2014 and\nbecause the stalwart Columbia had brought astronauts home from 27 previous\nflights \u2014 many NASA officials were lulled into complacency. They went so far\nas to assure the pilot and commander via email that \"there is no concern ...\nWe have seen the same phenomenon on several other flights and there is\nabsolutely no concern for entry.\"\n\nNASA officials also decided against enlisting spy satellite photography to\nexamine the shuttle damage more thoroughly. If they had, it's possible that\nthe astronauts could have repaired the spaceplane or at least abandoned it for\nrefuge on the International Space Station...\n\nAs the Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) noted in its final report,\n\"the NASA organizational culture had as much to do with this accident as the\nfoam.\" All of NASA's launches were suspended for two years. While the shuttles\neventually flew again, post-Columbia, the program was stunted and curtailed.\nThe article notes that since then SpaceX, Blue Origin, and the United Launch\nAlliance (Lockheed Martin and Boeing) \"are thriving today in the space\nindustry,\" along with Virgin Galactic and Axiom Space. \"NASA, far from feeling\nthreatened, has encouraged many of the private companies with massive\ncontracts. The agency already had a long history of dealing with sub-\ncontractors, using its pocketbook to steer aerospace development; that\ntradition has adjusted seamlessly to the current space economy.\"\n\nIn the other article CNN Space & Science writer Jackie Wattles notes that when\nAmerica later retired its Space Shuttle program in 2011, \"no U.S. astronaut\nwould travel to space on an American-made rocket for nearly a decade.\"\n\n### \u2190\n\n### Related Links\n\n### \u2192\n\nUS Energy Department Announces 'Blueprint' for Slashing Emissions From\nBuildings and Reducing Energy Use\n\n### Space Shuttle Columbia Breaks Up Over Texas\n\nThis is the most recent story.

Columbia was too heavy to reach the orbit the ISS was in. That's\nwhy it was never used in the construction of the ISS. Besides that, Columbia\nwas in a completely different orbital plane. I'm sure there many things that\ncould have and should have been done, as is always the case when looking\nbackwards. But refuge at the ISS was certainly not one of them.
