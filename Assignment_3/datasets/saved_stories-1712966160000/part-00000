Specifically, I am talking about the leading edge of\ninnovation, where all the goodness of smartphones, AI, and the cutting edge of\ncomputing goes. The sanctions on China were designed to ensure Western\ncountries preserve a several year advantage in this particular domain over\nwhat China can produce on their own.\n\nThanks for reading Rob\u2019s Substack! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and\nsupport my work.\n\nPat Gelsinger\u2019s relentless execution has made Intel a formidable presence in\nthis market, Samsung is reeling but still investing, and TSMC continues to\ndominate the foundry space with their extremely public, extremely important\ndifferentiator: they are a pure-play foundry.\n\n#\n\nWhat You Will Learn\n\nIn Part 1, I set up the history that makes this topic so urgent. Part 2 offers\na deep dive on what foundries do and why. Like the fundamental forces of\nnature, these are the fundamental topics that shape every conversation in\nsemis. These topics are quick to grasp at a high-level, but most of the nuance\nis left to professional conversations. In this post, we will open up the hood\non a few of these topics and walk through the mechanisms, math, and connective\ntissue of the tech and business, including:\n\n  1. The value proposition\n\n  2. Revenue generation\n\n  3. Scale\n\n  4. Yield\n\n  5. How customers choose foundries\n\nAgain, I worked at Intel on the BD team for their custom foundry as late as\n2017, which informs my perspective but will not get into its history or the\nspecifics of my work there.\n\n#\n\nThe Basics of a Foundry\n\nThe defining feature of a semiconductor foundry is that it only manufactures\nsemiconductors; it does not design them. It is the Easy Bake Oven; not the\ngoop you put inside of it. This clarification runs in contrast to the business\ndynamics inherent in Intel and Samsung, who design, market, and manufacture\ntheir own chips, a model known as integrated device manufacturing (IDM).\n\nAn analogy from Steve Blank:\n\nTSMC was the first pure-play fab. Morris Chang (founder) described the\ninspiration for the foundry as follows:\n\n> When I was at TI and General Instrument, I saw a lot of IC [Integrated Circuit] designers wanting to leave and set up their own business, but the only thing, or the biggest thing that stopped them from leaving those companies was that they couldn\u2019t raise enough money to form their own company. Because at that time, it was thought that every company needed manufacturing, needed wafer manufacturing, and that was the most capital-intensive part of a semiconductor company, of an IC company. And I saw all those people wanting to leave, but being stopped by the lack of ability to raise a lot of money to build a wafer fab. So I thought that maybe TSMC, a pure-play foundry, could remedy that. And as a result of us being able to remedy that then those designers would successfully form their own companies, and they will become our customers, and they will constitute a stable and growing market for us. -Oral History Interview: Morris Chang | SEMI\n\nIronically, in the late 1980s, the belief ran that you had to vertically\nintegrate your manufacturing to succeed. Morris Chang\u2019s core insight argued\nthat you could create much more value by separating the two, unleashing\ninnovative design engineers to work on the design side while the manufacturing\nengineers focused on general-use manufacturing.\n\nManufacturing is simply a culturally different domain than is that of design.\nThe hard part of design runs from the insight and creative vision that is\noften non-linear.\n\nThe culture of design is taste, novelty, and usefulness. The culture of\nmanufacturing is optimization.\n\nThe culture and art form of manufacturing revolves around paranoia. All the\nlittle things matter. A dust particle is your enemy. Creative divergence is\nThe Dark Force. Manufacturers follow rules and structures beautifully -\nrobotically beautifully. The culture of design is taste, novelty, and\nusefulness. The culture of manufacturing is optimization. Of course, the two\nare deeply interlinked and more cooperative than antagonistic\u2014design shows\nmanufacturing what is desirable, manufacturing shows design what is possible\nand economical at different scales.\n\nThe other big issue: HUGE capital for manufacturing plants versus relatively\ntiny capital for design companies: Fabulously low capex needed for fabless\ndesign semi companies.\n\nThe venture capital industry is arguably the most opportunistic group of\ninvestors in the world, especially in Silicon Valley. They want very small\namounts of capital invested which can subsequently return 500, 1,000, 5,000\ntimes that very small amount of capital. If they must invest LARGE sums - ie,\nnot $5 million or $10 million to properly capitalize a company ($1 billion+),\nthen it becomes geometrically harder to return huge multiples of that capital\ndown the line. So smaller is again, better.\n\nIn the case of a foundry, the capex numbers are massive. Billions. Not\nmillions. The cost is now so high that only TSMC, Intel, and Samsung are\ninvesting commercially in leading-edge, and even the IDMs (Intel and Samsung)\nhave shifted their business model to try to capture more foundry business to\nsupport their need for scale to keep playing. Chips happen to have the unique\nproperties that make this possible\u2014if you have the right value proposition.\n\n##\n\nI. The Value Proposition\n\n###\n\nHow does a foundry\u2019s customer make money?\n\nTo understand how manufacturers differentiate their tech, we are going to take\na detour into what shapes their customers\u2019 behavior i.e. how does a chip\ndesigner make profits. So we\u2019re talking about Apple, Qualcomm, and NVIDIA here\ni.e. companies that only design and sell chips, but don\u2019t manufacture them.\nBecause they don\u2019t have fabs, they are often just called fabless designers.\nChips are mostly commodities. Chips physically fit into a socket, so sales\nteams hawking chips refer to selling chips as \u201csocket hunts\u201d. Their potential\ncustomers have a need for a chip and they\u2019re evaluating bids from multiple\n\u201ccommodity\u201d chip sellers.\n\nWinning a socket hunt is a process analogous to every other b2b transaction,\nwherein the seller has to be better, faster, or cheaper to win.\n\nWinning a socket hunt is a process analogous to every other b2b transaction,\nwherein the seller has to be better, faster, or cheaper to win. That\nframing\u2014better, faster, and cheaper\u2014is strategically ambiguous. There are\ncritical questions about what better means, faster at doing what, etc. which\nentirely depend on what you\u2019re trying to make. Often there are other\nconstraints, like power or size, that drive if it works best for the kind of\ndevice it is serving. While all chips are made with transistors, the chips\nneeded to train an artificial intelligence model are different from the ones\nneeded to control the clock in your microwave. They are different hardware\napplications.\n\n###\n\nWhat are hardware applications?\n\nThe job of chips is to make software applications ... happen. It\u2019s great that\na given chip can process lots of data quickly and accurately - but just\nprocessing data is like chewing food without swallowing. So at the verrrry end\nof the day, the goal here is to render applications so that they satisfy the\nuser. That is... they use applications like Word or Excel or games or zoom or\nphoto editing stuff... in a seamless manner.\n\nBut in this sense, we are talking about hardware applications. The job of a\nhardware application is to optimally use transistors to form circuits which\nmaximize the performance of those software applications. Here are a few\nexamples:\n\n  * Central processing units (CPUs) are great for running lots of different kinds of programs in serial execution i.e. where one computation has to finish before another. Intel is probably the biggest brand still focused on CPUs.\n\n  * Graphics processing units (GPUs) are great for running simple programs across huge datasets. Critically, running one computation doesn\u2019t require solving the others first, so it can quickly parallelize the data.\n\n  * Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) is great if you only ever want to run one algorithm so you want every transistor on the board dedicated to doing one thing. As a consumer, it\u2019s unlikely you have encountered these, but they are more common in networking and telecom.\n\nOften the optimal solution in an application category can look quite similar\ne.g. lots of processors for mobile phones have the same basic components with\nthe performance and price differing in degrees. Of course, many companies have\nbeen born by making something new and different. The differences between\napplications is much bigger than the differences inside an application\ncategory.\n\n###\n\nAI is hot. How does AI fit into this?\n\nSidebar on AI. Artificial intelligence (AI) is rightfully getting a lot of\nbuzz. AI is a category of software applications. An AI has to be trained.\nAfter it has been trained, it is an AI model. AI models have recently\ndemonstrated capabilities in some fields above what humans have been able to\nachieve with their own algorithms. Nation states are racing to understand how\nthis capability can be exploited and how it undermines their security. And\nthey are at least notionally \u201cdangerous\u201d (if we\u2019re lucky, they\u2019ll come for the\nlawyers first). Hence all the paranoia around export laws with scale volume\n\u201cAI-driven\u201d chip designs and our good friends in China.\n\nAn artificial intelligence model requires massive levels of computation to\n\u201clearn\u201d from massive datasets. This training process is limited by hardware.\nThis learning process can take literally years, unless you can get better\nhardware, which can then subsequently reduce the process time to months,\nweeks, etc. depending on a number of variables. This friction lives at the\nheart of the export restrictions on selling these technologies to China. The\nUS wants to maintain a several year advantage in these categories, so any\nhardware that might enable China to build better AI is now restricted to sell\nthere without a license from the Feds that they aren\u2019t going to give out.\n(China is quite good at extra-legally accessing technology anyway - we just\ndon\u2019t want to let that happen without a modicum of friction.)\n\nWhen training an AI model, the trainers (designers) want chips that prioritize\nabsolute performance and efficiency over low cost. The aforementioned\nmicrowave manufacturer that just wants a chip for the clock only cares about\nperformance as much as if it can keep the time and then wants it to be as\ncheap as possible. All transistors, but very different application spaces. AI\nis expected to be a key beneficiary of leading-edge silicon going forward, and\nwe\u2019ll soon cover why they can get so expensive.\n\nShare\n\n###\n\nHow do foundries develop transistors to match fabless design customer\u2019s needs?\n\nUltimately, most chips get boiled down to a benchmark level of performance and\na cost per computation. Their value proposition comprises three elements:\n\n  1. The benchmark level of performance for that application (said another way, in car terms, \u2018what is your 0-60 mph time?)\n\n  2. The cost to achieve that performance is competitive i.e. the juice is worth the squeeze\n\n  3. The \u201cperformance envelope\u201d i.e. how much power does it use, how big is it, how much heat does it generate, etc.\n\nPerformance is always relative\u2014you are always being compared to something\nelse\u2014 here, \u2018else\u2019 is \u2018last year's chip\u2019 or the super cheap chips from 5 years\nago - they all work; they just work less quickly and/or elegantly as you\ncompare prices and performance from long ago chip architectures. The other big\n\u2018else\u2019 are your competitors also trying to win that socket.\n\nThe value equation must work to win a socket. As in other markets, some chip\ndesign companies will go for absolute performance (the fastest processing\nchip, albeit for a higher per-something price) while others will try to be\nvalue leaders. Ferrari vs. Lexus. In practice, most companies pursue a\nportfolio strategy: a flagship high-end with more, lower-performing products\nthat give customers the flexibility to meet different needs. For example,\nApple will make a new chip, but keep selling the old chip in the old design as\ntheir value play. Outside semiconductors, this similar strategy is employed by\nFord in the best-selling F-Series line, leading with the $80,000 Ford F-150\nRaptor R (the one my wife wants to buy despite never spending more than\n$27,000 on car, having no interest in trucks, and working from home) and the\n$34,000 Ford F-150 that Ford sells in high-volume to small businesses.\nMarketing!\n\nSetting aside my wife\u2019s love of military-grade aluminum and back to\ntransistors, many applications benefit from simply having more transistors. As\nwe covered in the first post, Moore\u2019s Law is the process of being able to draw\ntransistors smaller and smaller, such that you can fit more transistors in the\nsame amount of physical space. If your application benefits from more\ntransistors and you can sell more transistors at the same (or cheaper) price\nthan your competitors, your value prop will look amazing because you will meet\n(or exceed) the performance profile your customers want and your performance\nper dollar will be great.\n\nThis dynamic plays out all the time in gaming-oriented devices, notably the\ncentral processing unit (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs). In GPUs,\nNVIDIA is always pushing the high-end to perform even better, while charging a\npremium for it. AMD, their chief competitor in gaming GPUs, cannot compete\nwith the highest-performing GPUs, but they can sell ones that perform at 85%\nof the leading performance while being 60% of the cost. That\u2019s a strong value\nprop for many buyers. This competitive dynamic repeats in many application\ncategories, where chip designers seek the right mix of performance and cost.\nCompetition is what drives Moore\u2019s Law and is the mechanism by which higher-\ntransistor count equals more, better electronics throughout our life.\n\nAs a manufacturer, the foundry faces similar choices:\n\n  1. The foundry can make new nodes, keep setting new performance benchmarks, drawing transistors smaller and smaller. This translates to big profits in the long run, if not necessarily the short run..., as the companies with the highest value applications will seek out any hardware advantage they can get and are willing to pay for that level of performance.\n\n  2. A foundry can also cost-optimize existing manufacturing lines (iterating on a current node or adding another flavor to a node to target different applications) to get the performance per cost just right to maintain its attractiveness.\n\nAll of this is ultimately abstracted in the industry to PPA: power,\nperformance, area. Power indicates if it fits in your performance envelope.\nPerformance is usually how fast the transistors can toggle on-and-off in some\napplication-specific mode. Area is how much space it takes up. Area for a long\ntime has been a proxy for cost. Remember, smaller transistors are generally\nbetter, so you want density to go up while area goes down\u2014that gives you\nphysically smaller chips, so you can fit more on a wafer, and you get more\nproduct for the same cost per wafer. Sometimes you\u2019ll hear this as PPAC now,\nbreaking out area and cost, because smaller transistors are not necessarily\ncheaper going forward.\n\n##\n\nII. Revenue Generation\n\nMost foundry revenue comes from selling wafers. Customers want those wafers\ncut into chips, but for reasons we\u2019ll get into later, the smallest unit of\nsale is usually a wafer - think: you don\u2019t buy one egg at Safeway, let alone\nCostco.\n\nThe two critical numbers that define your profit contribution metrics are the\nnumber of wafers (scale) produced and revenue per wafer. To get those numbers,\na foundry will get a sense for the number of customers who might be interested\nin the new process technology, smoke some ayahuasca to learn what volumes and\nprices might be for the next decade, and place a bet if it will be a greater\ncash on cash investment return than other places they could invest that $40B\n(or if Tim Apple tells you to do it, or if the Taiwanese government tells you\nto do it so they can tap into some Dark Brandon Energy, etc.). Moore\u2019s Law\nmeans this bet has historically paid out, as long as the tech actually works.\n\n##\n\nIII. Scale\n\nLet\u2019s set up an example foundry on paper to show why spending $40B on an\nArizona fab is still attractive to TSMC. They are doing this enormous build\ntoday, often building several at a time. Of course, spending $40B reveals a\nbelief that the investor is going to get a return greater than $40B on that\nfactory.\n\n###\n\nHow do foundries measure scale?\n\nEmbedded in that $40B is an assumption that this fab is going to be a high-\nvolume fab, likely targeting 50-100,000 wafer starts per month. Think about a\nwafer start as making a pancake at Denny\u2019s when there is a union strike. The\npancake goes on the grill Tuesday at noon and you get served Thursday night.\nSo wafers take ages to get set to be made at scale - they then get cut up into\nchips but the whole process takes so long that the industry standard metric is\nall about wafer starts - if you know the number of horses at the starting\nline, you\u2019ll impute some lesser number after yield fails at the end.\n\nIt\u2019s not practical to scale up or down a fab after you\u2019ve built it, so you\u2019re\nmaking this decision early. Everything in semiconductors is about confidence\nand reducing risk of not getting a return on the massive investment. As for\nwhy 100,000, I don\u2019t have a firm answer but I assume that number has become\nsomething of an optimization point based around the physical constraints of\nthe number of tools required as well as the economics of the newer plants.\nSmaller plants are available at 45,000 or so, but those tend to be for older\nnodes where costs and revenues are smaller. And I return to the fact that this\nis entirely a scale business - like other things in dating and kaiju, larger\nis better and the higher volumes then amortize the initial high fixed costs of\nbuilding the plant and the capital costs much more efficiently.\n\n###\n\nHow do new nodes affect the scale of a company\u2019s operation?\n\nTSMC\u2019s average revenue per wafer in 2021 was about $4,000, spread across 291\ndistinct process technologies. A process technology is the size and scale you\ndraw transistors at, so they can draw transistors for money 291 different\nways. Pricing is always closely held, but often analysts and industry insiders\ncan back it out. At launch in late 2022, TSMC\u2019s 4nm node was reportedly going\nfor $17,000 per wafer. At the time, about half of TSMC\u2019s revenue came from\ntechnology released in the prior 5 years. The $17,000 flavor wafer delivered\nthe smallest transistors in the world; the chips coming out of this system\ndeliver massive value to the end customer which the wholesaler then (or\nretailer in Apple\u2019s case) can upcharge consumers for. The disparity between\nthe $17,000 for a new process technology and the average revenue per wafer of\n$4,000 illustrates how quickly older technologies become commoditized, how\nexpensive new process technologies are, and how having a differentiated\ntechnology is how to recognize outsized profits. The horrible truth is that\nscale and revenue per wafer are highly correlated\u2014those who execute well in\ndelivering process technologies that are better, sooner than others get the\ndemand from customers. In effect, they leverage their scale advantage in a\nkind of \u201cwinner take all\u201d business map. Note that TSMC\u2019s market capitalization\neven after the market fallings in 2022 and China sniffing around their borders\nis $641 billion.\n\n###\n\nHow do the economics of new nodes work financially?\n\nI promised numbers, so let\u2019s look at the first 3 years or so of a new\ntechnology. Today (T-3), you place your bet for $40B. You won\u2019t see profit,\nlet alone real revenue, for 3 years (T1). You\u2019re designing your factory for\n100,000 unit sized production slates, but if it\u2019s brand new, it definitely\nwill not be running at peak capacity right away. Instead, you\u2019re going to\nscale up to 100,000 wafers per month as your team gets more comfortable. The\nplant managers decide to start at 50% utilization, i.e. they are only going to\nproduce 50,000 wafers per month to start and slowly scale up to >90%. Both\nnumbers are based on how TSMC operates their tech over time, often not\nstarting production until they can achieve 50% utilization and topping out\naround 90% after it has reached maturity in a few years. Each process\ntechnology is different, requiring new tools, and the utilization is often a\nfunction of how quickly you can master those tools.\n\nSimple financial model: I have emphasized the marginal revenue and cost per\nwafers. The plant\u2019s wafer costs are pretty much flat, meaning that wafer 1\ncosts the same as wafer 10,000 in the volumes the plan calls for. And for now,\njust completely ignore depreciation, taxes, and the cost of providing\nchildcare to operators and technicians.\n\nFundamentally, the plant is buying processed silicon sand for ~$500 and\nselling it (after a ton of very high IQ work) for ~$17,000.\n\nFundamentally, the plant is buying processed silicon sand for ~$500 and\nselling it (after a ton of very high IQ work) for ~$17,000. The business on\npaper is beautiful. It\u2019s almost software, or something analogous to a CD or\nDVD stamping business. In practice, TSMC makes about a 50% gross margin across\nall their lines. They define gross profit margins as revenues minus the costs\nof revenue which includes costs of equipment, labor, and materials directly\nused in manufacturing, excluding operating costs like R&D, G&A, and marketing.\nI recall they seek about 80% contribution margin on new process technologies\nin their first year of production, so cost per wafer is likely closer to\n$3,400 per wafer with a floor at process maturity less than $2,000 per wafer\n(averages 50% margin on wafer revenue of $4,000).\n\nTSMC will have had a couple years to reap some big profits. At the high-end,\nApple, NVIDIA, and others want to pay for performance as soon as they can get\nit. TSMC will sell as much as they can before competing foundries at Samsung\nand Intel bring their tech online in 3-4 years, when prices for similarly\ndense, powerful and light $17,000 style wafers ... will decline (note how\nprices decline in T3 and T4). As for how low TSMC\u2019s prices will decline...I\nhave no idea. If their average revenue per wafer is $4,000 but the newer stuff\nis inherently more expensive with less competition, maybe the prices stay\nhigher longer? I left it at $10,000 after T5 and I will leave it to the reader\nto make their own scenarios for higher or lower.\n\nIf TSMC is good and lucky, they will be close to recovering their cash\ninvestment in year 4. Here\u2019s a guess at how that simple foundry might work out\nto T10. While I modeled the loaded marginal cost per wafer as flat, in\npractice, their buildings are on a 10\u201320-year depreciation schedule while the\nmachinery and equipment is on a 5-year schedule. There would be some savings\nto loaded marginal cost per wafer after T5 as a result.\n\nAt $17,000 per wafer and a cost of $3,400 per wafer, that\u2019s 2.9 million wafers\nrequired to recover a $40B investment, ignoring all the exogenous stuff. Just\nto frame these volumes: TSMC manufactured about 14.2 million wafers total in\n2022, representing an estimated 24% market share of 59 million units in the\nwhole market.\n\nBeyond just recovering their capital, TSMC also has to plan for the future.\nMoore\u2019s Law marches on, and TSMC\u2019s customers expect them to lead the way. By\nT1, TSMC will have already had to invest in building a fab for their next-\nsmallest process technology. By T3, they\u2019ll just be recovering their\ninvestment and will start on the generation beyond that. The margin for error\nis slim.\n\n###\n\nWhere does wafer demand for a new technology node come from? Why isn\u2019t\neveryone doing this?\n\nWhen you make a new process technology, some of your customers will choose to\nstop making the stuff they were making before. The new entrant elbows out the\nmargin for the makers of that product who are less-than-awesome at doing so.\nFor TSMC to make a new production technology, some of the expected 2.9 million\nwafers will come from the 14.2 million wafers you already make. Some of the\nvolume will be all-new, though, which will only add to your total wafer\nproduction across all lines. If it were all new wafers, the new production\ntechnology would represent a 2% increase to TSMC\u2019s total capacity. Now, this\n2% might not sound like much, but historically, making this transition has\nbeen enough to scare away all about 3 players, TSMC, Intel, and Samsung.\nAssuming they could even get the capital to attempt it, the others are\nterrified because there\u2019s so much that can go wrong, including:\n\n  * Timelines could slip. Delays in construction, obtaining requisite tools, and developing expertise with those tools to reach performance milestones can all increase the risk that you will never recover the investment.\n\n  * Your competitor could master the new technology faster than expected, reducing the revenue potential of the new investment.\n\n  * The customer bringing you that early version decides they don\u2019t want to buy as many and your volumes crater (or their customers get tired of your incremental updates and decide they can wait longer for a new one). In fact, having that first customer (your anchor) is essential to attaining the scale you need to ever recognize a profit on your fab. There are only about 4-5 anchor customers in the world, with Apple the clear #1 and NVIDIA a bitter #2.\n\n    * Note that China has several aspiring anchor customers, like Huawei. At least, these were anchors in a globalized economy, where they have access to the best technology and Western markets (and steal and subvert and...) It\u2019s a matter of debate if they\u2019ll remain anchors, though they are now shoving any demand they can spare to the aspiring Chinese foundries.\n\nFrom a traditional business perspective, think about the grocery store\u2019s\nchoice of selling Diet Coke for $7 a 6-pack where they make 20 cents a unit\nversus selling capers for $15 where they make $9. They\u2019ll choose Diet Coke\nevery time because DC\u2019s volumes are MASSIVE relative to caper bottle sales.\nHowever... If somehow the market price of that Diet Coke dropped 45 cents, the\ngrocery store is now losing 25 cents a pack for the privilege of selling it.\nSo it\u2019s ... risky.\n\n###\n\nWhat does it look like if this bet goes wrong?\n\nTo give a sense of how this looks when things go sideways, let\u2019s visit the\nother end of the talent pool: GlobalFoundries (GF). Until 2008, GF was the\nmanufacturing arm of AMD, who was designing, marketing, and manufacturing\ntheir own products. I have emphasized trust several times, and TSMC emphasizes\nit in their own annual report. GF exists because Intel (allegedly) committed\nsome...light...anti-competitive behavior, significantly undermining AMD\u2019s\nability to generate revenue and the scale necessary to keep investing in\ncompetitive technologies. (Note I did not join until 2011, so this was recent-\nish to when I was working on chip design strategy at Intel but it wasn\u2019t\nanything I had any knowledge or visibility into.) The FTC would ultimately\nsettle with Intel, but it seems the damage was done. In such a competitive\nenvironment, it\u2019s not hard to consider it a small price to pay to cripple your\nmost significant threat. AMD needed the manufacturing assets off its books,\nand its manufacturing arm would have to stand on its own. GF was born. The\nconsequences for Intel are still playing out, as fabless companies know Intel\ncan be ruthless towards competitors.\n\nGF would continue to introduce new process technology for a few years, until\nbadly dropping the ball with Apple. In 2014, GF \u201cbought\u201d IBM\u2019s fabs (IBM\nwanted these assets off their books so badly they gave them an exclusive\ncontract to continue production of IBM chips plus $1.5B to take them). In\n2016, to try to keep up with Intel and others, GF licensed the latest\ntechnology from Samsung. By 2018, GF announced they wouldn\u2019t make any smaller\nprocess technologies and continue to optimize and refine the larger\ntechnologies. As of 2024, their smallest process offering is 12nm.\n\nBigger is better. Scale wins. But we\u2019ve yet to introduce the most important\nmetric\u2014the only metric those in the silicon mines really talk about: yield.\n\n##\n\nIV. Yield\n\n###\n\nWhat is wafer yield? Why is it so important to semi manufacturing?\n\nMoore\u2019s Law is all about being really good at drawing small transistors.\nResearch labs can in fact draw transistors at much smaller scales than what\u2019s\nproduced in volume. The research labs are not very good at it, so only a few\nof the ones they draw actually work. These research projects are important\ntechnical demonstrations that illustrate potential technology paths for\nmanufacturers, but the research only matters if you can do it at scale. Things\nthat work in a lab under non-commercial and extremely controlled conditions\ndon\u2019t necessarily translate into commercial production facilities that make\nchips profitably.\n\nWhen a factory produces chips, it makes them in the form of giant 20\u201d diameter\nwafers which are then cut into, say, 100 die which are (usually) packaged into\n100 chips. Said another way, one wafer produces 100 chips. And many of those\nchips are broken or don\u2019t work as expected. One dust particle ruined that\nproduction run. One burst of electrons from the solar flare changed the magnet\nsystem on the flux capacitor and other chips didn\u2019t work. Fifty other things\ncan go wrong here. Lots of accidents happen when flying at these speeds. So\nwhen you produce a wafer that would notionally carry 100 chips, the actual\nuseful yield from that wafer is... less. Generally, the smaller the\ntransistors, the higher the error rate.\n\nAn older test run from 2019, this shows a wafer with an analysis of good and\ndefective dies. Dies are the foundation of a chip, before other important\npieces are added. Yield is assessed on each die before adding other components\nto form a chip, as the other components can be expensive and wasted if the die\nis defective. Because you\u2019re cutting rectangles into a circle, the outer edge\nis excluded.\n\nYield is defined as the number of functional chips produced in a given\nmanufacturing run, divided by the total number of chips that were attempted to\nbe produced during that run. Previously, I stated that the foundry charges by\nthe wafer, not the chip. The foundry\u2019s customer defines what functional means\nand, critically, has most of the levers to change the design to improve the\nnumber of functional chips and the degree to how well chips function.\nPerformance is rarely binary but continuous. Again, these companies are\nselling a portfolio so even though it might not perform like a $300 chip, it\u2019s\nstill saleable as a $200 chip. Therefore, the foundry\u2019s customer carries the\nrisk of poor yields.\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s a partnership to do your best and make the economics work. It\nis not uncommon for the first attempt to be zero-yield\u2014i.e. no working chips.\nLearn and repeat. Sometimes, customers want to push the yield risk onto the\nfoundry by only paying for good die. Foundries will accommodate customer\nrequests as much as they can, and there are no good data on terms of\nagreements, but most major deals I am aware of are for wafers.\n\n###\n\nHow does wafer yield affect semiconductor manufacturing economics?\n\nLet\u2019s add yield to our calculation. For their high-end iPhone chip, the A16\nBionic chip, TSMC can fit about 492 chips per 12\u201d wafer. Let\u2019s start with a\nprocessing run where everything runs perfectly, and the fab plant produces a\nwafer run with 100% yield and TSMC recognizes $17,000 per wafer of revenue\nfrom Apple:\n\nThe cost works out to $35 per chip. What happens if we plug in a realistic\nfirst year yield?\n\nIn that first year, the customer is paying the same amount to the foundry per\nwafer but only getting half as many \u201cgood\u201d chips, so the cost per chip is\nessentially double. Recall that the value proposition covers three things:\n\n  1. The benchmark level of performance for that application (said another way, in car terms, \u2018what is your 0-60 mph time?)\n\n  2. The cost to achieve that performance is competitive i.e. the juice is worth the squeeze.\n\n  3. The \u201cperformance envelope\u201d i.e. how much power does it use, how big is it, how much heat does it generate, etc.\n\nPoor yields increase the cost per functional chip. The poorer the yield, the\nworse the value proposition gets for a foundry\u2019s customers as well as for the\nfoundry. This is predicted and hedged as much as possible, but the newer the\nprocess technology, the higher the uncertainty around yields.\n\nThis is a floorplan of an A16 Bionic processor, the system-on-chip processor\nat the heart of the iPhone 14 Pro. Designed by Apple, this is the most visible\nuse of TSMC\u2019s 4 nm process in late 2022.\n\nThat first production period is known as risk production, where a foundry is\nstill learning what works and what doesn\u2019t. Reportedly, Apple\u2019s rather basic\nrequirement is >50% of the chips have to work. Foundry customers can only bear\nso much cost increase before it\u2019s uneconomical to sell, so they limit\nproduction while yields are poor. Apple and TSMC work together to relentlessly\nmaximize yields. Errors are tracked down with brute force and complex\ndiagnostic tools and by run number 30, yields are over, say, 40%. Lather,\nrinse, repeat and after 8 months, yields on this new cutting-edge wafer\nproduction facility can kiss 80%.\n\nAs yields go up, it becomes more economical for more customers to come on\nboard. Ideally, the fab manufacturer is simultaneously increasing max wafer\nstarts per month, improving yield, and controlling the price per wafer. Even\nbetter, if your competitors are yielding poorly, you can keep your rates high\nand recognize more profits longer.\n\n###\n\nWhat is required to improve yields?\n\nAnswering this question in detail would require several graduate degrees that\nI do not have. The short version is:\n\n  * The best photolithography tools, which today come from ASML in their Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) product lineup. Today, these products produce wafers the fastest at the highest scale with the highest yields at the smallest transistor size.\n\n    * China explicitly was barred from using these tools, which essentially limits the commercial viability of the products they can make. Yet, China has continued making smaller transistors. How? They use older technology (Deep Ultraviolet aka DUV) that\u2019s slower, more defect prone, etc. The yield is reportedly pretty good, but it\u2019s inherently more expensive and will have practical limits. Good enough if you just want better transistors for the military though.\n\n  * Tribal knowledge about how to use the tools (Morris Chang loves talking about the importance of TSMC\u2019s seasoned operators and technicians, with extremely low employee churn rates)\n\n  * Good process design kits, a software tool given to chip designers that describe the \u201crules\u201d of manufacturing for this new technology before it exists.\n\n###\n\nHow has yield shaped the foundry market?\n\nIn the lead up to the CHIPs Act, US semiconductor manufacturers struggled with\nyield. Intel had a disastrous attempt at yielding their 7 nm process\ntechnology (which at the time was called 10 nm but was since re-branded to 7).\nGF was so bad at yielding new process technologies that Apple had to take all\ntheir iPhone 7 volume to TSMC. Of course, GF gave up on harder process\ntechnologies as a result.\n\nAgain, this is a business about confidence and reducing risk. When companies\nhave stumbled this poorly, would you bet your company on their success?\n\n##\n\nV. How Customers Choose Foundries\n\nI have touched on how hard it is to produce chips profitably, at scale, and\nwith high yields.... and why fabs must win volume to survive and profit. Here\nis what those chip designers care about in a foundry partner:\n\n  1. Technology development: Technology development (TD) derives from scientists and engineers planning their design or \u2018draw\u2019 of transistors. Success in technology development is about:\n\n    1. Transistor performance: There are different kinds of transistors for different kinds of hardware applications. TD creates essentially catalogs of different kinds of transistors with different performance characteristics that map to the application categories they\u2019re interested in.\n\n    2. Yield: This is about setting rules that the customers\u2014the chip designers\u2014can easily implement to achieve good yields, fast.\n\n    3. Timeline: Can this process be implemented at scale on the requisite timeline?\n\nThe job of the brilliant PhDs working in technology development is to create\nthe blueprint for customers to get an appealing value proposition that the\nmanufacturing guys are confident they can build. If they create an enticing\nvalue proposition for customers, but it\u2019s so error-prone that manufacturing\ncan\u2019t build it, what was the point (\ud83d\udc40 IBM)? Getting technology development is\nso critical to performance that even companies that don\u2019t manufacture their\nown products employ their own teams to teach fabs how to optimize the\nsupplier\u2019s process technology for their chips.\n\n  2. Manufacturing capability: How many wafer starts per month are available? When will it be online? Where is production occurring geographically\u2014is it close to the rest of the customer\u2019s value chain? Is it in a politically sensitive region? A foundry\u2019s manufacturing discipline in both controlling the production environment and tracking the process over time can impact your ability to keep yields high.\n\n  3. Ecosystem: There is a massive ecosystem of IP and electronic design assistance (EDA) tools to help fabless chip designers get to market quickly. The best comparison I can draw here is to the tier suppliers in the automotive industry. You don\u2019t need to reinvent the tire to make a new car, you just need to pick which kind of wheel and tire best matches your car\u2019s use-case. The EDA tools help you do that and integrate it into your design and into the foundry\u2019s design rules.\n\n  4. Trustworthy customer service: A foundry is ultimately in the service business. A fabless design company is handing them the keys to the castle, including all their IP and their roadmap, entrusting they will give them functional wafers years down the line that they can monetize. While technology is important, building semiconductors is a game of trust and confidence. Can you and will you do what you say you\u2019re going to do? Pushing Moore\u2019s Law forward is hard enough, (and it may be broken and who really cares? Moore\u2019s Law just meant that chips would get better, faster, and cheaper for a long time and they did).\n\nWhile technology is important, building semiconductors is a game of trust and\nconfidence. Can you and will you do what you say you\u2019re going to do?\n\nA pure-play foundry is the only one that can definitively answer that they\nwill always put customers first. Alternatively, an IDM has their own products\nto consider. Any IDM asking a fabless designer to let them manufacture their\nproducts is effectively asking them to put the life of their company in the\nhands of someone with all the resources to compete with them. Worse, they\ncould simply not prioritize their wafers. This fear is often more theoretical,\nas IDMs are often looking to sell capacity to areas they don\u2019t want to invest\ndesign resources into...though of course if that market gets attractive enough\nsomeday? At an IDM, customer #1 is always the internal customer. At a pure-\nplay foundry, customer #1 is whomever has the most resources.\n\nOk, that\u2019s the crash course in leading-edge foundry. When it all goes wrong,\nyou get GlobalFoundries. In part 3, we\u2019ll use this framework to analyze what\nAmerican taxpayers are actually subsidizing and how to assess the success of\nthe industrial policy going forward.\n\nThanks for reading Rob\u2019s Substack!
