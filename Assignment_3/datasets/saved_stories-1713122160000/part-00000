Some\ncircumstances are even more extreme, she added.\n\n\"They're having to juggle being able to afford rent and/or utilities versus\nbeing able to actually buy groceries, so it's getting to a level where it's\nbecoming very, very difficult to not only recruit agents into these high cost\nof living areas, but also retain them in those areas,\" said Bara, who is a\nsecond-generation FBI agent.\n\nA survey last year found more than two-thirds of agents who live in these\nplaces said it's difficult to manage on their current salaries.\n\nThe Agents Association is pressing for a housing allowance to support those\nworkers who pay steep rent or mortgages because they live in New York, Newark,\nHonolulu, San Diego, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, Miami, Seattle and\nWashington, D.C. They're asking for $165 million to be included in the Justice\nDepartment's 2025 budget to pay for a pilot program.\n\nFBI officials have been looking into the problem since 2021, comparing\ngovernment compensation scales against the poverty line and analyzing how\nother federal agencies and private sector employers pay their workers.\n\n\"There are multiple stressors that folks experience,\" said Caroline Otto,\nassistant director of the FBI's Resource Planning office. \"We have heard very\ncompelling and heart-wrenching stories across the workforce in these areas.\"\n\nFBI agents have little say in where they are placed once they graduate from\nthe academy. What's more, agents usually come to the bureau as a second\ncareer, and they often take a pay cut to start.\n\n### Law\n\n### As she leaves DOJ, associate AG recalls the cases that will 'stick with me\nforever'\n\nIn New York, for example, starting salaries for FBI agents hover around\n$73,000. But a nonprofit group in the city reported people need to earn at\nleast $100,000 to afford food, housing and transportation there. That number\nreaches $150,000 to cover a family of four people.\n\nRepresentatives from the Agents Association have met with leaders at the FBI\nand the Justice Department to raise their concerns.\n\nThe FBI says it needs both additional funding and authority from Congress to\npursue a housing allowance. Rather than a pilot program, FBI leaders are\nhoping for something more permanent.\n\n\"We are looking for a more permanent, sustainable solution for all individuals\nwithin these high-cost field offices,\" said Otto, the assistant director.\n\nAt the Justice Department, Assistant Attorney General for Administration\nJolene Lauria said officials are aware of financial challenges that federal\nworkers face in the field \u2014 not just FBI employees, but across other parts of\nthe DOJ as well.\n\n\"The Justice Department is supportive of innovative efforts undertaken by the\nFBI and is also working across its components to identify achievable and\nsustainable strategies that support our people in the field,\" Lauria said.\n\"The Department is ready and willing to work with Congress on more permanent\nsolutions.\"\n\nIt's not clear whether a majority in the closely divided House of\nRepresentatives will support any FBI housing allowance.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive nominee for the Republican\nparty in the 2024 election, has targeted the FBI workforce with steady\ncriticism for years. And at a \"weaponization of government\" event at the\nconservative-leaning Heritage Foundation this week, there were new calls to\n\"defund\" the bureau.\n\n  * San Diego\n  * Justice Department\n  * FBI\n  * New York\n\n### More Stories From NPR\n\n##### National Security\n\n#### The U.S. counterintelligence head says the list of threats is long and\ngetting longer\n\n##### Obituaries\n\n#### O.J.
