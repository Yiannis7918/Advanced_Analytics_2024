It reportedly paid the Palo Alto based\nstartup $650 million in a move that saw scores of the team transfer to\nMicrosoft, along with giving Redmond the right to use Inflection's models.\n\nCompetition officials within the EU are already closely inspecting Microsoft\u2019s\ninvestment in OpenAI, believed to be in the region of $13 billion, and are\nchecking to ascertain if this runs afoul of the region's merger rules. Also\nunder the magnifying glass is Microsoft's $15 million stake in Mistral.\n\nMargrethe Vestager, executive veep for the European Commission and head honcho\nof the antitrust team, this week said the exchange between Microsoft and\nInflection was not a merger and so \"not caught by merger rules.\"\n\n\"We might (look into it),\" she told reporters including Reuters, \"but we have\nno decisions, neither to do something or not do something. We have registered\nthat this is happening and also registering that it's happening in a way so\nthat it escapes our scrutiny from our usual boxes.\"\n\nThe trigger for an official investigation would be more similarly shaped\nagreements between major tech corporations and AI startups.\n\n\"Of course if things become a trend and if that trend seems to be something\nthat circumvents what has been put in place to preserve competition, which is\nmerger rules, of course that could be restored and eventually corrected,\"\nVestager said.\n\nA spokesperson for the EU told us: \"We are following closely the developments\nin this sector, but I am afraid we would not comment any further at this\nstage.\"\n\nMicrosoft refused to comment.\n\nGoogle and AWS have also become significant AI venture capitalists. In 2023,\nthe Chocolate Factory stumped up a reported $2 billion for Anthropic,\nincluding $500 million upfront and $1.5 billion to come over time. Since\nSeptember, Amazon has pumped $4 billion into Anthropic, developer of the\nClaude family of models.\n\nAmazon is also dangling $500k in cloud credits to attract AI startups, as\noutlined this week. The thought process is to get in early to build links with\nfledgling businesses that may become customers long term, and might even\ncreate tech that Amazon wants first refusal on.\n\nThe industry's gone mad since OpenAI rolled out a demo of ChatGPT in November\n2022 \u2013 share prices are now built on the potential of AI, and it seems like a\nbubble that will burst at some point, unless shareholders start to see returns\non the investments being made in the sector.\n\n  * Stability AI reportedly ran out of cash to pay its bills for rented cloudy GPUs\n  * X's Grok AI is great \u2013 if you want to know how to hot wire a car, make drugs, or worse\n  * Microsoft, OpenAI may be dreaming of $100B 5GW AI 'Stargate' supercomputer\n  * AI hallucinates software packages and devs download them \u2013 even if potentially poisoned with malware\n  * Why Microsoft's Copilot will only kinda run locally on AI PCs for now\n\nMicrosoft is still trying to convince customers that Copilot is worth the\nmoney, and Dell said last month it is also running proof of concepts for\ngenerative AI.\n\nArthur Lewis, President of the Core Business Operations for Dell\u2019s Global\nInfrastructure Solutions biz, used a baseball analogy to describe the stage it\nis at with many customers.\n\n\"When it comes to the enterprise, we're in the car pulling up into the\nstadium, and the teams are still trying to figure out the rules of the game,\"\nhe told attendees at Morgan Stanley\u2019s Technology, Media and Telecoms\nconference.\n\n\"So folks are crossing Ts and dotting Is and running a lot of PoCs (proof of\nconcepts) against a myriad of different use cases to really understand where\nthe productivity benefits,\" he added.\n\nSuch is the call for AI talent that Elon Musk said Wednesday he is giving his\nAI engineering team a raise, \"contingent on progress milestones\" to deter\ndefections to rivals.\n\nMusk claimed OpenAI is \"aggressively recruiting Tesla engineers with massive\ncompensation offers and have unfortunately been successful in a few cases.\"\n\nAccording to The Information, Tesla's head of vision has quit Tesla to join\nxAI, after Musk convinced him to stick within his corporate camp instead of\nswitching to OpenAI.\n\nMusk added on X: \"The talent war for AI is the craziest talent war I've seen!\"\n\u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * AI\n  *
