Damages amounted to an approximate\nreal-currency value of $300,000-330,000 USD.  \n  \nThe Battle of B-R5RB or the Bloodbath of B-R5RB (/\u02c8bi\u02d0 t\u00e6k \u0251\u02d0r fa\u026av \u0251\u02d0r \u02c8bi\u02d0/\n^i) was a massive-scale virtual battle fought in the MMORPG space game EVE\nOnline in January 2014 (YC 116 in-game), possibly the largest player-versus-\nplayer battle in gaming history at the time. The 21-hour-long conflict pitted\nthe Clusterfuck Coalition and Russian alliances (CFC/Rus) against the N3\nCoalition and Pandemic Legion alliance (N3/PL), and involved over 7,548 player\ncharacters with a maximum of 2,670 players in the B-R5RB system at one time.\nThe in-game cost of the losses totaled over 11 trillion Interstellar Kredit\n(ISK), an estimated theoretical real-world value of US$300,000 to $330,000\n(equivalent to between US$380,865 and $418,952 in 2023), as derived from the\ncontemporaneous market value of PLEX, an item purchasable with real currency\nthat can be redeemed either for subscription time or traded for in-game\ncurrency.\n\nPart of a larger conflict known as the Halloween War, the fight started after\na single player controlling a space station in the N3/PL-controlled star\nsystem B-R5RB accidentally failed to make a scheduled in-game routine\nmaintenance payment, which made the star system open to capture. Being a key\nstaging area used by N3/PL in the war, the CFC and Russian coalitions began\npouring players into the system in a swift offensive, and N3/PL moved in a\nlarge fleet of players as a response. A massive battle erupted in the system,\nand numerous smaller engagements occurred throughout the game universe as\nplayers attempted to block reinforcements from joining the battle. CFC/Rus\ngained a clear win by inflicting heavy losses on N3/PL and successfully\ncapturing B-R5RB. The losses totaled 576 capital ships, including 75 Titans\n(the largest ships available to players), along with thousands of smaller\nvessels.\n\nTo commemorate the sheer size and cost of the battle, the game's creators, CCP\nGames, erected a permanent monument in the system B-R5RB named \"The\nTitanomachy\", consisting of non-salvageable capital ship wrecks.\n\n## Background[edit]\n\nSee also: Eve Online \u00a7 Universe\n\nEve Online is an MMORPG space game in which players engage in a variety of\nactivities including mining, piracy, manufacturing, trading, exploration, and\ncombat. The size, scale, and intricacy of the game world and its economy and\npolitics means that accomplishing anything consequential typically involves\njoint efforts by many players over days, weeks, even months and years.^[4]\nPlayers may form corporations (clans, guilds or alliances in other video\ngames), and these corporations in turn can formally join in alliance with\nother corporations. Many of these alliances create informal coalitions to work\ntoward common goals and fight competing alliances.^[5] Despite the prevalence\nof coalitions in the game, there is no formal in-game mechanic providing for\nthese \"super-alliances\". The Halloween War was a conflict in the game universe\nwhich started around Halloween in late October, which pitted the player\nalliance coalitions CFC and Russian - the later so-called because of the real-\nworld nationality of many of the players^[5] - and their allies against the N3\nand Pandemic Legion player coalitions and their allies.^[6]^[7] B-R5RB,\nlocated in the Immensea region, served as the staging ground for all Pandemic\nLegion fleets.^[3]^[7] A few days before the fighting in B-R5RB, the CFC and\nRussian coalition suffered a decisive loss to N3 and Pandemic Legion forces in\nthe Battle of HED-GP in the Catch region, due to the N3/PL's \"Wrecking Ball\"\nformation.^[3]^[8]\n\nBetween the coalitions involved, the Battle of B-R5RB involved 717 player\ncorporations and 55 alliances.^[5] In the Clusterfuck (CFC) and Russian (Rus)\ncoalitions, RAZOR Alliance, under the command of user Lazarus Telraven, was a\nmajor participant within CFC, as was the Goonswarm Federation and Stainwagon,\nand within Rus, Solar Fleet, Darkness of Despair, and Against ALL Authorities\nwere majorly involved alliances.^[5]^[8]^[9] On the side of the Pandemic\nLegion and N3 coalitions, Northern Coalition and Nulli Secunda were two of the\nmajor alliances involved.^[3]^[5]\n\nIn Eve Online, players can claim sovereignty over some star systems if they\nmake payments (typically at that time about 1 billion of the in-game currency\nInterstellar Kredits) to CONCORD, the in-game, non-playable security force,\nand claim a star system using a Territorial Claim Unit.^[5]^[6] Sovereignty\ngrants the controlling player \"reinforcement timers\", that is, real time\nwaiting periods of several days designed to allow defenders to rally. Without\nsovereignty, or if, as was the case with B-R5RB, sovereignty is lost, the star\nsystem is vulnerable to immediate attack from hostile players.^[5] On January\n27, 2014 (YC 116 in-game), the one-year anniversary of the immense Battle of\nAsakai, player corporation \"H A V O C\", a member of Nulli Secunda, mistakenly\nfailed to make a scheduled payment to CONCORD.^[6]^[7]^[10] The user Manfred\nSideous of Pandemic Legion claimed that he had enough ISK in his holding\ncorporation wallet and had autopay checked, raising the possibility of\nsabotage or an in-game bug.^[5]\n\n## Battle[edit]\n\n### Outbreak of conflict[edit]\n\nAn enemy scout discovered the Nulli Secunda alliance quietly attempting to\nregain control with units called Territorial Claim Units (TCU),^[11] which are\nused for announcing control over a star system. Lazarus Telraven, a fleet\ncommander of the player coalition Rus, made a decision to launch an early\nattack instead of waiting until his coalition's fleet scheduled muster at\n14:00 Eve time (which is equivalent to GMT). His fleet destroyed the enemy\nTCUs and RAZOR Alliance, one of the player alliances under Telraven's command,\ntook the station, and set up its own TCU in order to establish control of the\nstar system.^[5] At around 14:00, with an hour remaining before Nulli Secunda\ncould regain control, the CFC and Russian coalition sent a capital fleet to\nthe station.^[12]^[11] Capturing the B-R5RB system would enable the CFC and\nRussian coalition to trap Pandemic Legion assets, including hundreds of\ncapital and sub-capital ships, thus preventing those ships from joining the\nwar. CFC and Russian coalition forces scrambled to gain control of the system,\nwith thousands of players logging on and preparing their fleets.^[3] Lazarus\nTelraven had command of about 1,000 players with some 255 ships. His two\nfellow commanders, Mister Vee and Vily, were at their real-world jobs and thus\nTelraven had sole command of the fleet.^[5]\n\n### Battle for B-R5RB[edit]\n\nPandemic Legion and N3 moved to retake the system from CFC and Rus, but the\nRussians destroyed all Territorial Claim Units anchored in the system. N3/PL\nthen deployed their super-carrier and carrier fleet in the \"Wrecking Ball\"\nformation just off the system's space station, a formation which had\npreviously defeated the CFC and Russian alliance.^[3]^[8] As the conflict was\na surprise and occurred on a Monday workday, CFC and Rus decided to take\nadvantage and gain field superiority before N3 and PL could respond and so\ndeployed their entire capital fleet to the system. Meanwhile, they deployed\ntheir sub-capital fleets to N3 staging systems, including I-NGI8 and GXK-7F,\nto delay any reinforcements.^[3]^[13] N3/Pandemic Legion ships finally arrived\nat around 15:30.^[5]\n\nEach side then attempted to rush all available pilots into the system, and the\ngame's time dilation software engaged. Time dilation is a game feature created\nby developer CCP Games to handle heavy loads on the game server without the\ngame lagging or disconnecting players.^[9]^[14] In time dilation, the game\nslows to ten percent normal speed, with each second of game time displaying as\nten seconds of real time. The two sides traded Titan kills every hour, when\ntheir Doomsday weapons could fire again, and the system became filled with\nwarp disruption bubbles, making extraction difficult.^[11] For a while neither\nside gained any real advantage, though CFC/Rus managed to on-line their\nTerritorial Claim Units and held a slight lead in the number of enemy Titans\ndestroyed.^[3]^[11] Throughout the engagement, related battles played out\nacross the entire game universe as fleets tried to block reinforcements,\ndestroy fleeing capitals and super-capitals, or trap pilots attempting to\nenter the fray.^[3]\n\nThe tide of the battle started to turn when Manfred Sideous, the initial N3/PL\nfleet commander, handed control to Vince Draken, CEO of the player alliance\nNorthern Coalition. Vince Draken managed to concentrate fire on and destroy\nseveral CFC/Rus Titans and also forced some additional Russian Titans to leave\nthe system with depleted shields and armor. However, N3/PL overestimated their\nsuccess and began to focus their attacks on the Titan belonging to Sort\nDragon, the commander of all remaining Russian forces in the field. This Titan\nhad very high damage resistance, and Sort Dragon drew upon his entire fleet to\nassist in repairing it, enabling it to hold out much longer than most other\nTitans up to that point. By the time his Titan fell, the CFC/Rus had managed\nto destroy five N3/PL Titans, putting the alliance well ahead.^[3] James Carl,\na member of the N3/Pandemic Legion coalition, reported to the Associated Press\nthat \"It looks like CFC is winning, but we're hoping now that all of our US\nplayers are online, we'll turn the tide\".^[14] But when the US time zone\nplayers logged on and reinforcements became available, PL did not see the\nnumbers they had expected, and the CFC blockaded adjacent systems to prevent\nthem joining the battle. Eventually, N3/PL could no longer destroy any Titans,\nand ordered a retreat.^[11] They switched their fire onto CFC/Rus's\nDreadnoughts in an attempt to take out as many ships as possible during\nretreat. Due to their spy network under Intelligence Commander Tobias Deidorm,\nCFC knew that N3/PL had ordered a retreat and deployed Interdictors and Heavy\nInterdictors to prevent the withdrawal.^[13] N3/PL lost several more Titans,\nSuper Carriers, and Capitals in the extraction, with many trapped by the warp\ndisruption bubbles strewn throughout the battle area. The battle definitively\nended when the Eve universe went offline for its regular daily maintenance at\n11:00 UTC on January 28, disconnecting all players.^[3]\n\n## Aftermath[edit]\n\nOver 7,548 unique characters participated in the overall battle, of which\n6,058 participated directly in the B-R5RB system with a maximum of 2,670 in\nsystem at the same time.^[3]^[6] These numbers included 717 unique player\ncorporations and involved 55 unique player alliances.^[5] Joystiq called the\nbattle potentially the largest recorded PvP battle in any game to date.^[9] On\nthe CFC\u2014Rus side, approximately 3670 capital ships were involved, including\nroughly 143 Titans, 273 Supercarriers, 817 Dreadnoughts, and 233 Carriers, as\nwell as thousands of sub-capital ships.^[2] N3\u2014PL brought against that about\n1616 capital ships, including around 72 Titans, 172 Supercarriers, 355\nDreadnoughts, and 414 Carriers, and thousands of sub-capital ships.^[2] The\n21-hour-long conflict resulted in the loss of 75 Titans, 13 supercarriers, 370\nDreadnoughts, and 123 Carriers, along with thousands of smaller ships and\ninnumerable fighters and drones.^[3]^[15] N3 and Pandemic Legion lost 59\nTitans, while CFC and the Russian coalitions lost only 16.^[3]^[15] CFC\u2014Rus\nalso lost 2 Supercarriers, 106 Dreadnoughts, 5 Carriers, and over 1900 sub-\ncapital ships, while N3\u2014PL lost 12 Supercarriers, 259 Dreadnoughts, 112\nCarriers, and over 1250 sub-capital ships.^[3]\n\nAn estimated 11 trillion ISK in assets was lost during the battle, and media\noutlets reported the battle as the biggest and most expensive in EVE Online's\nhistory at the time, estimating that the battle cost US$300,000\u2013330,000 in\nreal-world money.^[7]^[8]^[16] This estimate comes from a figure listed in the\nofficial report by CCP Games, which the report based on a theoretical\nconversion of pilot license extensions, or PLEX, into real-world USD. While\ndirect conversion of real currency into ISK, or vice versa, is strictly\nprohibited, and PLEX units are purchasable in-game, additional PLEX units can\nbe purchased for US$20, and it is from this theoretical real-world value that\nthe estimated dollar amounts lost in the battle are drawn.^[4]^[17] However,\nthis does not mean this amount of real-world money was expended, as many ships\nwere purchased through in-game currency or corporation assets.^[17]\n\nEyj\u00f3lfur Gu\u00f0mundsson, an economist hired by CCP Games to oversee EVE Online's\neconomy, stated:\n\n> \"To me, as an economist, that doesn't really matter. In both cases this is\n> economical value that is created by people's work, either in real life or in\n> virtual life. They put their blood, sweat and tears into making stuff so\n> they can have an advantage in a battle, because in this battle like in any\n> other battle in meat worlds, in real life, it is the resources you have\n> available.\"^[17]\n\nHe further commented that, as an economist, he enjoys the destruction wrought\nfrom such battles, because \"war in Eve is the consumption of Eve Online.\" The\ntremendous removal of value due to B-R5RB results in longstanding economic\nimpact, as ships would need to be replaced, minerals mined, and people\nreorganized and trained. In his opinion, this is what keeps the Eve game\nuniverse alive and healthy. However, a few days later, Gu\u00f0mundsson reported\nthat there was no rush on minerals. While trading for all the key low end\nminerals necessary for rebuilding had increased in volume, sometimes as high\nas %100, the impact on price was modest, and on the overall game economy the\nimpact was minimal.^[17]\n\nAlexander Gianturco, who goes by the in-game character The Mittani, CEO of\nGoonwaffe (the largest corporation in the Goonswarm Federation alliance and\nhence the largest alliance in the CFC),^[18]^[19] reported to Polygon near the\nend of the battle:\n\n> \"As vengeance for [the battle of Asakai] goes, it's somewhat ironic; our\n> forces lost three Titans and seven supercarriers last year in Asakai, and\n> lost the battle. This year we've killed 40+ hostile Titans and we have seven\n> more hours of killing before downtime.\"^[7]\n\nAlso near the end of the battle, Ali Aras wrote on TheMittani.com, an EVE\nOnline news website run by the CFC, that the \"kills made here decide not only\nthis war, but the next, and the next after that\". He also highlighted some of\nthe economic repercussions, including the increase in the price of Tritanium,\nwhich he viewed as an upshot of \"the flurry of industrial production to\ncome\".^[11]\n\nFollowing the Battle of B-R5RB, Pandemic Legion withdrew from the Southeast\ntheater and formed an agreement with the CFC which allowed them to evacuate\nbillions of assets from the B-R5RB system.^[20] Other N3 forces retreated in\nfrom the south, and in the following few days CFC alliances managed to capture\na total of 23 systems in the regions Immensea, Catch, Tenerifis, and\nFeythabolis from N3/Pandemic Legion alliances.^[21] The CFC then withdrew from\nthe southeast theater. In the weeks after, the Russian bloc suffered internal\ntroubles, allowing N3 to regain all of the territory lost after B-R5RB and\nconquer most of the Russian bloc's territory.^[22] In the longer term, B-R5RB\nestablished CFC, later re-branded as The Imperium, as the predominant\nsuperpower in EVE Online, with little serious resistance challenging the\ncoalition for the next two years.^[23]\n\nDue to the media attention given to the battle, it, like Asakai the year\nbefore, inspired thousands of people to join the game. In the 30 days after\nB-R5RB, new player subscriptions increased 10 percent (although most players\nquit after one month of gameplay). This resulted in a minimum of US$50,000 in\nadditional revenue for CCP Games.^[24]\n\n## Scale[edit]\n\nThe total number of players in the B-R5RB system peaked at 2,670, which was\nless than the previously largest battle in Eve at 6VDT-H, which had 4,070\nplayers in the main battle.^[25] B-R5RB however had many smaller related\nbattles playing out, meaning it involved more players in total. The number of\nplayers was later surpassed by the battle of 9-4RP2, with over 6,000 players\nin system and many more in related battles. However, due to technical issues\nwith the larger battle, B-R5RB remains the second largest battle in the EVE\nOnline universe in terms of resources destroyed.^[26] An even larger battle at\nFWST-8, in 2020, saw 8,825 players participating in total, with a peak of\n6,557 located in the system, breaking two Guinness World Records for the\n\"Largest Multiplayer Videogame PVP Battle\" and the \"Most Concurrent\nParticipants in a Multiplayer Videogame PvP Battle\", making it the current\nlargest battle in the game in terms of player count. B-R5RB remained the most\nexpensive battle.^[27]^[28] However, on December 31, 2020, the Massacre at\nM2-XFE broke the record of largest total destruction in a single battle,\ncosting about US$378,012 in player investments.^[29]^[30] The scale of the\nB-R5RB and others in the EVE Online universe have sparked the development of\nin-game historiographies and public history.^[31] This and the scale of its\neconomy, which has been academically studied, exemplifies how Eve Online\ntranscends typical classification as an MMORPG.^[31]\n\n## Commemoration[edit]\n\nOnce the game went into downtime, developer CCP Games announced that it would\ncreate an in-game monument in the B-R5RB star system to commemorate the\nbattle. \"Titanomachy\" was created using brand-new Titan wreck models\nintroduced with EVE Online: Rubicon's 1.1 release which came out immediately\nfollowing the battle.^[3]^[15] The name references both the Titan-class ships\nused in the game and the war in Greek mythology between the Titans and the\nOlympian gods.^[32] CCP Games posted on the EVE Online website that they\nplanned to install \"Titanomachy\" during downtime of January 31, and were \"hard\nat work placing the wrecks in a hauntingly beautiful arrangement\".^[3] Placed\naround the seventh planet in the B-R5RB system, the installation is \"off grid\"\nfrom the space station. CCP Games stated:\n\n> \"Thereafter, any player who plays [Eve Online] can make the dangerous\n> pilgrimage there and marvel at the scope of destruction. We expect some of\n> the 'travel' bloggers to do full write-ups on it almost immediately and [Eve\n> Online] videographers to make some moving tributes as well.\"^[3]\n\nThe history of the battle and the installed memorial was labeled by historian\nDaniel Fandino \"must-see\" for players as well as the general public who might\notherwise not be interested in the game.^[32] In 2021, PC Gamer included the\nTitanomachy as one of the \"coolest Eve Online locations you should visit at\nleast once\", and called the landmark one of the most important in the game's\nhistory.^[33]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Battle of Asakai\n  * CCP Games\n  * Eve Online\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Raimo, Tarek (January 6, 2015). \"The Grand Chessboard 2014\".
