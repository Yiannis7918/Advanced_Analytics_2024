Post-landing inspections showed three\ncabin windows missing as well as substantial damage to the left horizontal\nstabiliser of the aircraft.\n\nUK-AAIB carried out an investigation and issued a Special Bulletin to raise\nawareness of the recent occurrence.\n\nSo , what happened that day ? How did the windows go missing ?\n\n  * In a recent occurrence several cabin windows on an Airbus A321 were damaged by high power lights used during a filming event.\n  * The damage was discovered after takeoff on the aircraft\u2019s next flight.\n  * Following landing it was discovered that the outer panes of three windows were missing.\n  * AAIB is working with the aircraft manufacturer and operator to fully understand the properties of the lights used and how this risk can be managed in future.\n\n### History of the flight\n\nThe Titan Airways aircraft was scheduled to embark on a multi-day charter away\nfrom base with a flight crew consisting of three pilots, an engineer, a load\nmaster and six cabin crew. The first sector was a positioning flight from\nLondon Stansted Airport to Orlando International Airport, Florida.\n\nIn addition to the 11 crew there were nine passengers on board who were all\nemployees of the tour operator or aircraft operating company. The passengers\nsat together in the middle of the aircraft just ahead of the overwing exits.\n\nThe aircraft took off from Runway 22. Several passengers recalled that after\ntakeoff the aircraft cabin seemed noisier and colder than they were used to.\n\nAs the aircraft climbed through FL100 and the seatbelt signs were switched\noff, the loadmaster, who had been seated just in front of the other\npassengers, walked towards the back of the aircraft. He noticed the increased\ncabin noise as he approached the overwing exits and his attention was drawn to\na cabin window on the left side of the aircraft.\n\nHe observed that the window seal was flapping in the airflow and the\nwindowpane appeared to have slipped down. He described the cabin noise as\n\u2018loud enough to damage your hearing\u2019.\n\nAfter the finding reached the cockpit, the flight crew stopped the climb at\nFL140 and reduced airspeed whilst the engineer and then the third pilot went\nto look at the window. Having inspected the window, it was agreed the aircraft\nshould return to Stansted.\n\nCockpit established the aircraft in a hold whilst they completed the\noverweight landing checklist, confirmed landing performance and briefed for\nthe return to Stansted. The approach and landing on Runway 22 were uneventful.\n\n### Previous Day Activity\n\nThe day before the occurrence flight the aircraft had been used for filming on\nthe ground, during which external lights had been shone through the cabin\nwindows to give the illusion of a sunrise. The lights were first shone on the\nright side of the aircraft for approximately five and a half hours, with the\nlight focused on the cabin windows just aft of the overwing exits.\n\nThe lights were then moved to the left side of the aircraft where they\nilluminated a similar area on the left side for approximately four hours.\nPhotographs taken during filming showed six sets of flood lights on both sides\nof the aircraft.\n\n### Examination of Aircraft Cabin windows\n\nTwo window assemblies were missing, and the inner pane and seal from a third\nwindow were displaced but partially retained in the airframe. A shattered\nouter pane was recovered from the entrance to a rapid-exit taxiway during a\nroutine runway inspection after the aircraft landed.\n\nA fourth window protruded from the left side of the fuselage. The four\naffected windows were adjacent to each other, just aft of the left overwing\nexit.\n\nRemoval of the cabin lining inside the passenger cabin revealed that the\nwindow retainers were in good condition and correctly installed. The foam ring\nmaterial on the back of the cabin liners was found to be melted in the areas\nadjacent to the windows that were damaged or missing.\n\nVisual examination of the damaged windowpanes revealed that they were deformed\nand shrunk. The deformed panes no longer formed an effective interface with\nthe rubber seals.\n\nIn the presence of AAIB, the operator removed several cabin liners from the\nright side of the passenger cabin. This revealed additional thermal damage and\nwindow deformation in the area around the overwing emergency exit, but to a\nlesser extent than the left side of the aircraft.\n\n### Horizontal stabiliser Findings\n\nThe underside of the left horizontal stabiliser leading edge panel was\npunctured. Small pieces of acrylic were found in the stabiliser when the panel\nwas removed.\n\n### External lighting\n\nPhotographs of the filming showed that the Maxibrute 12 flood lights were\nbetween approximately 6 and 9 m from the window areas where damage was\napparent.\n\n### AAIB Observations\n\nThe windows appear to have sustained thermal damage and distortion because of\nelevated temperatures while illuminated for approximately four to five and a\nhalf hours during filming activity the day before the flight. It is likely\nthat the flood lights were positioned closer than 10 m.\n\nSource and Credit : AAIB Bulletin S2/2023 SPECIAL / \u00a9 Crown copyright 2023\n\n### RELATED NEWS\n\nAircraft\n\n#### First Hungarian KC-390 Military Transport Aircraf...\n\n13-04-2024\n\nAircraft\n\n#### Long-awaited Gulfstream G700 has received FAA type c...\n\n30-03-2024\n\nAircraft\n\n#### Flown Only For 117 Hours Since 2019, Ugandan Police ...\n\n29-03-2024\n\nAircraft\n\n#### Milestone Reached - Embraer\u2019s E2 Jets Certified F...\n\n16-03-2024\n\nAircraft\n\n#### NASA's New Rendering of the Transonic Truss-Brac...\n\n08-03-2024\n\nAircraft\n\n#### Pentagon is expected to lift the flight ban on V-22 ...\n\n02-03-2024\n\nAircraft\n\n#### Final investigation report on the May 2020 fatal ...\n\n26-02-2024\n\nAircraft\n\n#### U.S. Department Of Justice Confirms Possession Of T...\n\n12-02-2024\n\n### LEAVE A COMMENT\n\n  * MOST VIEWED\n\n###### Airlines\n\n### Confirmed !
