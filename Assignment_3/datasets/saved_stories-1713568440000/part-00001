Designed to offer improvements over Intel's\n8080 and built with embedded computing in mind, the Z80 quickly rose to become\none of the most popular CPU choices for microcomputers \u2014 going head-to-head\nwith MOS Technology's rival 6502, launched a year earlier, and appearing in\ndevices including the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, Tandy TRS-80, and Namco's Pac-Man\narcade cabinets.\n\nAlthough a design of its era, the Z80 CPU is still a popular choice for both\nmodern embedded systems and enthusiast gadgets longing for a nostalgic return\nto simpler times \u2014 but it appears Zilog is finally calling time on the line,\ndespite its status at one time as one of the mostly highly second-sourced CPU\ndesigns.\n\nThe Zilog Z80, in continuous production since 1976, has finally reached the\nend of its life \u2014 in standalone CPU form, at least. (\ud83d\udcf7: Zilog/Electronics\nMagazine)\n\nIn a product change notice issued by Zilog parent company Littelfuse this\nweek, the company warned users that \"our Wafer Foundry Manufacturer will be\ndiscontinuing support for the Z80 product and other product lines\" \u2014 with 14\nJune 2024 as the last-time-buy (LTB) date, after which the parts will no\nlonger be available to order.\n\nThe notification names 13 Z80 parts, all in the Z84C00 family, as being\nofficially end-of-life \u2014 including parts which are commonly used to replace\nfaulty chips in vintage computers or to build Z80-powered modern machines\ninspired by same. The discontinuation does not, however, appear to cover the\nnewer Z180 nor the eZ80 embedded core ranges \u2014 only the standalone CPU parts.\n\nAn email address for those affected by the parts' end-of-life status is\navailable in the product notification PDF; \"depending on the overall LTB\ndemand,\" Zilog warns, \"minimum/maximum order quantities may be implemented.\"\n\nMain article image courtesy of Gennadiy Shvets, CC BY 2.5.\n\nmicrocontroller\n\nretro\n\nGareth Halfacree\n\nFreelance journalist, technical author, hacker, tinkerer, erstwhile sysadmin.\nFor hire: freelance@halfacree.co.uk.\n\n##### Latest articles\n\n##### Sponsored articles\n\n##### Related articles\n\nGet our weekly newsletter when you join Hackster.\n\n##### Latest articles\n\nRead more\n\n##### Related articles\n\n  * ### About Us\n\n  * Hackster Overview\n  * Hackster for Business\n  * Help Articles\n  * Brand Resources\n  * Sitemap\n\n  * ### Legal Thingies\n\n  * Terms of Service\n  * Code of Conduct\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Privacy Policy for California Residents\n  * Cookie Policy\n\n  * ### Find Us On Social\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * X\n  * YouTube\n\n  * ### Visit Our Avnet Family\n\n  * Avnet\n  * Premier Farnell\n  * element14\n  * Newark\n\nHackster.io, an Avnet Community \u00a9 2024\n\n", "frontpage": true}
