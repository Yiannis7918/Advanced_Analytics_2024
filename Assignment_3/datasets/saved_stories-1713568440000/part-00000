A handful of\nstreamers gathered to investigate its monster-filled caverns and hallways,\nonly to find their friend had gone missing. \u201cDid Ben die?\u201d one wondered aloud,\njust before another spotted him with relief in his voice. \u201cI\u2019m not even\nkidding, it took me,\u201d Ben starts to say. \u201cIt carried me a mile underground.\u201d\nOne of his companions interrupts: \u201cWai-wai-wait, shut up, shut the fuck up,\nshut up! Tell that story on camera now.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, OK OK,\u201d Ben replies, getting into position. Someone shines a flashlight\non him. The light hits a gelatinous monster behind him. It yanks him away,\nagain, before he even can finish his sentence. Luckily, his kidnapping is all\non camera this time, and content creator videogamedunkey has a potential viral\nhit on his hands\u2014both in the game, Content Warning, and on his real-life\nYouTube channel.\n\nIn the week since its release, Content Warning\u2014a co-op horror game about\ntrying to film monsters (and survive) to get views on a faux YouTube\u2014has been\na runaway hit for developer Landfall Games. In the first 24 hours after it hit\nSteam, more than 6 million players downloaded it.\n\nFeatured Video\n\nBuilt by a tiny team of five developers in just six weeks, Content Warning has\nquickly become gaming\u2019s latest trending topic by being a send-up of the very\nplayers it was made for: game streamers aiming to go viral and the fans who\nlove to watch them. A perfect meta commentary on how far some influencers will\ngo for a win. Across YouTube and Twitch, where the game\u2019s fans are most\nvisible, everyone just knew what to do: film, film, film.\n\nThe team behind Content Warning sensed they had something special the first\ntime they recorded a video of their expedition and watched it together. \u201cIt\nwas instantly hilarious,\u201d says developer Zorro Sv\u00e4rdendahl. It\u2019s not that\nthey\u2019d done anything special\u2014in fact, they\u2019d mostly filmed each other walking\nbehind trees and playing peek-a-boo\u2014but the bones were there. They just had to\nmake the game\u2019s videos punchier.\n\nIn the game, players have three days to capture footage good enough to rack up\nviews online, but every time they enter the game\u2019s Old World they\u2019re at risk.\nMonsters tend to appear suddenly out of the dark, sometimes with jarring\nscreams.\n\nA finished video, which surviving team members gather to watch at the end,\ntypically has a The Blair Witch-ian found footage quality to it\u2014shakey shots\ntaken while running, a lot of screaming, and above all people barking things\nlike \u201cGet this on film.\u201d The game\u2019s goofy aesthetic for its SpookTubers, who\nhave figures similar to arm-waving inflatables and faces that players create\nby typing emoticons, makes the whole thing all the more entertaining.\n\nContent Warning is part of a long tradition at Landfall Games, which releases\na small, silly game every year on April Fools\u2019 Day. One year, it was a \u201chorse-\ndrifting-romance-roadtrip-battle-royale\u201d; for another, it was a parody of\nbattle royale. This year\u2019s title is about the many players who have seamlessly\nadapted to being influencers. There\u2019s a huge social element at work, where\npeople are role-playing with their friends in the game. Sometimes it\u2019s a\nYouTuber-type. Sometimes it\u2019s as a news reporter trying to do a very\ntumultuous interview. People get creative.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Security\n\nHackers Linked to Russia\u2019s Military Claim Credit for Sabotaging US Water\nUtilities\n\nAndy Greenberg\n\n  * Security\n\nThe Real-Time Deepfake Romance Scams Have Arrived\n\nMatt Burgess\n\n  * Business\n\nGoogle Fires 28 Workers for Protesting Cloud Deal With Israel\n\nCaroline Haskins\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Rise of the Carbon Farmer\n\nJessica Rawnsley\n\n\u201cYou absorb [the culture] if you're hanging out online a lot, which we all\ndo,\u201d Landfall\u2019s head of community, Hanna Fogelberg, says. \u201cEven if you don't\nwatch a streamer or a YouTuber every day, you kind of understand the culture\nand the memes around it.\u201d\n\nPrior to this year\u2019s April Fools\u2019 release, the team was interested in making a\nhorror game, and Content Warning gave them the chance to scratch that itch. In\nhorror games, says Sv\u00e4rdendahl, monsters make a game good\u2014but it\u2019s bad news to\nactually see them. Content Warning offers the antithesis; not only do you want\nto find the monsters, he says, but it\u2019s also part of what makes the game\nfunny. If you manage to capture footage of a rare monster, or find yourself in\na uniquely odd predicament, he says, \u201cit feels a bit mythical.\u201d\n\nThe monsters themselves don\u2019t make a ton of sense, which is spot-on for how\nthey\u2019re created. Sv\u00e4rdendahl\u2019s codeveloper, Erik Skog, made and animated the\nmonster models. His process was simple, says Sv\u00e4rdendahl: \u201cHe would just be\nlike, \u2018So I made a little guy who screams,\u2019 and then that's it. We're like,\n\u2018OK, that's amazing, Erik.\u2019\u201d (While none of the monsters have official names,\nthe screamer is appropriately nicknamed Screamo.) One of the game\u2019s more\ncommon encounters, a weird little snailman, was welcomed with equal\nenthusiasm.\n\n\u201cHe had been up late the evening before,\u201d Sv\u00e4rdendahl says, \u201cand he said, \u2018I\nmade a snailman.\u2019 There was no discussion. It was just, \u2018OK, there's a\nsnailman now. I think that's good.\u2019\u201d\n\nMonsters serve different purposes. A blob can snatch players away from their\nfriends and dump them somewhere else on the map to force groups apart. A leggy\negg beater monster is a spectacular nuisance. \u201cHe runs into walls,\u201d\nSv\u00e4rdendahl says. \u201cHe's really silly and super dumb. I enjoy how he creates so\nmuch chaos in groups, he's so loud, but he doesn't really do anything.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been a little more than a week since the game\u2019s release, but already the\nteam wants to add new monsters, maps, and more variety to the game. On Twitch,\nContent Warning videos get thousands of views in a matter of days, if not\nhours. On YouTube, it's the same.\n\nThe unexpected influx of players, however, has led to unexpected problems.\n\u201cSorry the servers are burning,\u201d Sv\u00e4rdendahl says. \u201cWe're working on it.\u201d\n\n#### Content\n\nTo honor your privacy preferences, this content can only be viewed on the site\nit originates from.\n\n## You Might Also Like ...\n\n  * Navigate election season with our Politics Lab newsletter and podcast\n\n  * Think Google\u2019s \u201cIncognito mode\u201d protects your privacy?
