Yet rain it has \u2013 in biblical proportions.\n\nPrecipitation began on Monday night also hitting Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, and\nSaudi Arabia, but the United Arab Emirates bore the brunt. By Tuesday evening,\nmore than 142 mm (5.59 in) had fallen on Dubai. On average, the city gets 94.7\nmm (3.73 in) in an entire year.\n\nAnd it was right on time for thousands of Web3 fans to descend on the city for\nthe self-described \"premier\" cryptocurrency conferences. \"Liquidity\" jokes\nabounded as attendees posted footage from the TOKEN2049 floor showing people\ntiptoeing about in ankle-deep water. The event is hosting speakers including\nBitcoin.com founder Roger Ver, Telegram CEO Pavel Durov, Binance CEO Richard\nTeng, and even our old friend Bryan Johnson, though who knows how he is going\nto tie his \"I'm never going to die\" shtick to the blockchain.\n\nMeanwhile, Blockchain Life announced this morning that it was pushing its\nagenda back to 1:30pm \"because of the traffic situation in Dubai,\" clearly\nhoping for some evaporation action as sunshine and 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) temperatures\nreturned.\n\nBoth events confirmed the conferences would proceed, though Dubai's\ninfrastructure was severely affected. Pictures and footage posted online show\ncars submerged \u2013 up to their roofs in some places \u2013 and flights experienced\n\"significant disruption,\" the Emirates airline said. We can see why from clips\nof the inundated landing strip.\n\nConference attendees reported 10-hour-plus waits for taxis from the airport,\nand roads being completely flooded between Marina and Downtown. The Metro was\nobviously inoperable, and Ubers were getting stuck on the streets. Some on the\nground even paid as much as 1,000 AED ($270) for a cab from the airport to the\nMarina area, presumably because most were underwater, while those redirected\nto Abu Dhabi were also welcomed by deluged roads.\n\nIt is difficult not to feel a sense of schadenfreude, not for the property\ndamage and distress caused by increasingly erratic weather across the globe,\nbut because initiatives like cryptocurrency are a step backward for human-\ninfluenced climate change (not to mention all that Gulf oil).\n\n  * Alleged cryptojacker accused of stealing $3.5M from cloud to mine under $1M in crypto\n  * Software engineer helped put Sam Bankman-Fried behind bars, say prosecutors\n  * Singapore expands regulations for digital payment token service providers\n  * Canonical cracks down on crypto cons following Snap Store scam spree\n\nAccording to a study by the United Nations published last year, during 2020 to\n2021 the global Bitcoin mining network consumed 173.42 Terawatt hours of\nelectricity. If Bitcoin were a country, then, its energy consumption would\nhave ranked 27th in the world, which is higher than Pakistan, a country of\nmore than 230 million people.\n\n\"The resulting carbon footprint was equivalent to that of burning 84 billion\npounds of coal or operating 190 natural gas-fired power plants,\" the UN said.\n\"To offset this footprint, 3.9 billion trees should be planted, covering an\narea almost equal to the area of the Netherlands, Switzerland, or Denmark or 7\npercent of the Amazon rainforest.\"\n\n## Mozilla founder blasts browser maker for accepting 'planet incinerating'\ncryptocurrency donations\n\nREAD MORE\n\nHowever, since investors (and criminals) have become so dug into\ncryptocurrencies, it is safe to say that the unnecessary pollution is now a\nfact of life, though how much longer places like the UAE will be habitable due\nto mining and even AI's insatiable hunger for energy is a disturbing unknown.\n\nIn other human climate meddling, the UAE has been \"cloud seeding\" \u2013 delivering\nsmall particles of silver iodide to clouds with drones or aircraft so that\nwater droplets form around them, increasing chance of precipitation \u2013 since\n2002 to address water security concerns.\n\nMeteorologist Ahmed Habib told Bloomberg that the Gulf state \"dispatched\nseeding planes from Al Ain airport on Monday and Tuesday to take advantage of\nconvective cloud formations.\"\n\nAs the Earth heats up, and warm air can hold more water vapor, this may have\ncome back to bite them. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Blockchain\n  * Climate Change\n  * Cryptocurrency\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Blockchain\n  * Climate Change\n  * Cryptocurrency\n  * Environment\n  * United Arab Emirates\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Bitcoin\n  * Coinbase\n  * Crypto.com\n  * Ethereum\n  * FTX\n  * NFT\n  * Renewables\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Earth\n  * EMEA\n  * Science\n\n#### More about\n\n15 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Blockchain\n  * Climate Change\n  * Cryptocurrency\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Blockchain\n  * Climate Change\n  * Cryptocurrency\n  * Environment\n  * United Arab Emirates\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Bitcoin\n  * Coinbase\n  * Crypto.com\n  * Ethereum\n  * FTX\n  * NFT\n  * Renewables\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Earth\n  * EMEA\n  * Science\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Digital Realty ditches diesel for salad dressing in US to cut datacenter\nemissions\n\nHydrotreated vegetable oil to power bit barns stateside after successful Euro\ntrial\n\nSystems7 days | 15\n\n#### Alleged cryptojacker accused of stealing $3.5M from cloud to mine under\n$1M in crypto\n\nNo prizes for guessing the victims\n\nResearch2 days | 2\n\n#### Google sues app devs, claims they're Play Store crypto scammers with\n100k+ victims\n\nThe pair allegedly made 87 apps since 2019 and defrauded folks of tens of\nthousands of dollars\n\nApplications13 days | 20\n\n#### Protecting distributed branch office environments from ransomware\n\nAs ransomware becomes more sophisticated, detection tools should be upgraded\nto cover every site and location\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### Singapore expands regulations for digital payment token service providers\n\nMore entities will need a license\n\nPublic Sector16 days | 2\n\n#### Software engineer helped put Sam Bankman-Fried behind bars, say\nprosecutors\n\nCTO shared code from his laptop with investigation after FTX collapsed\n\nSoftware15 days | 22\n\n#### SWIFT embraces central bank digital currencies after sandbox success\n\nPromises it can handle digi-bucks and tokenized assets without new\ninfrastructure, maybe next year\n\nSoftware23 days | 20\n\n#### FTX crypto-crook Sam Bankman-Fried gets 25 years in prison\n\nCould have been worse: Prosecutors wanted decades more\n\nCyber-crime21 days | 107\n\n#### SEC cleared to take securities beef against Coinbase to trial\n\nJudge says watchdog can HODL four of its five charges against crypto exchange\n\nApplications22 days | 2\n\n#### US sanctions spree continues with 15 more for Russian entities\n\nFinancial firms that help evade existing restrictions in crosshairs\n\nPublic Sector23 days | 4\n\n#### Intel's green dream is chips without any dips in Mother Nature's health\n\nSustainability Summit pushes industry partners to reduce their environmental\nimpact, including harmful chemicals\n\nSystems21 days | 7\n\n#### Crypto wallet providers urged to rethink security as criminals drain them\nof millions\n\nInnovative Ethereum feature exploited as victims say goodbye to assets\n\nCyber-crime30 days | 13\n\nThe Register Biting the hand that feeds IT\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Contact us\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Who we are\n\n#### Our Websites\n\n  * The Next Platform\n  * DevClass\n  * Blocks and Files\n\n#### Your Privacy\n\n  * Cookies Policy\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Ts & Cs\n\nCopyright.
