These microbes may\nhave dominated Earth early on in our planet's history and are well-suited to\nemerge on faraway worlds that circle dim red stars smaller than our sun, a new\nstudy suggests.\n\nThe latest cataloging effort is in part \"to create a database for signs of\nlife to make sure our telescopes don't miss life if it happens not to look\nexactly like what we encounter around us every day,\" study co-author Lisa\nKaltenegger of Cornell University said in a statement. \"Purple bacteria can\nsurvive and thrive under such a variety of conditions that it is easy to\nimagine that on many different worlds, purple may just be the new green.\"\n\nRelated: How exotic alien life could thrive in the giant molecular clouds of\ndeep space\n\nOn Earth \u2014 the only planet we know of where life exists and thus our best\nguide in the hunt for extraterrestrial life \u2014 life sustains itself on oxygen-\nproducing photosynthesis driven by chlorophyll, the familiar green pigment\nutilized by most organisms to harness sunlight. This wasn't the case until\nroughly 2.4 billion years ago, when tiny blue-green algae called\ncyanobacteria, the first known species to photosynthesize, began using\nchlorophyll to harness sunlight and carbon dioxide for metabolic energy, and\nreleased oxygen as a byproduct.\n\nPrior to that, microorganisms generated metabolic energy by harnessing\nsunlight using a purple-pigmented molecule called retinal, whose origin may\nhave predated chlorophyll. If retinal exists on other faraway worlds,\nscientists think the molecule's unique fingerprint would be discernible by\nupcoming ground- and space-based telescopes.\n\n\"They already thrive here in certain niches,\" said study lead author L\u00edgia\nFonseca Coelho of the Carl Sagan Institute in New York. \"Just imagine if they\nwere not competing with green plants, algae and bacteria: A red sun could give\nthem the most favorable conditions for photosynthesis.\"\n\n## Get the Space.com Newsletter\n\nBreaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events\nand more!\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nThe current search for alien life is biased toward looking for green pigments,\nprimarily because of limited measurements of organisms of other colors\nincluding purple, Coelho and her team argue. To develop a catalog of the\nchemical makeup of purple organisms, the researchers grew purple bacteria\ncollected from different places \u2014 including shallow pond waters at Cornell,\nMassachusetts's Cape Cod and deep-sea hydrothermal vents \u2014 and measured their\nunique fingerprints. In subsequent simulations, they modeled purple bacteria\ndominating a variety of Earth-sized planets, including ocean worlds, frozen\nicy orbs and terrestrial rocky spheres like Earth.\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\n\u2014 If there's life on Europa, solar sails could help us find it\n\n\u2014 Life on Enceladus?
