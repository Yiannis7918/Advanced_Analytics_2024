These\nsystems\u2014equipped with one or more sensors, either of the same or different\ntypes\u2014capture information related to foot movement or pressure maps beneath\nthe foot. This captured information offers an overview of the subject\u2019s\noverall movement, known as the human gait. Beyond sensing, these systems also\nprovide a platform for hosting ambient energy harvesters. They hold the\npotential to harvest energy from foot movements and operate related low-power\ndevices sustainably. This article proposes two types of strategies (Strategy 1\nand Strategy 2) for an energy-autonomous shoe-based system. Strategy 1 uses an\naccelerometer as a sensor for gait acquisition, which reflects the classical\nchoice. Strategy 2 uses a piezoelectric element for the same, which opens up a\nnew perspective in its implementation. In both strategies, the piezoelectric\nelements are used to harvest energy from foot activities and operate the\nsystem. The article presents a fair comparison between both strategies in\nterms of power consumption, accuracy, and the extent to which piezoelectric\nenergy harvesters can contribute to overall power management. Moreover,\nStrategy 2, which uses piezoelectric elements for simultaneous sensing and\nenergy harvesting, is a power-optimized method for an energy-autonomous shoe\nsystem.\n\nKeywords:\n\naccelerometer; piezoelectric; gait; step-count; activity recognition\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nThe study of wearable devices is a trending research topic, owing to their\nnon-invasive approach and ability to deliver continuous, real-time monitoring\nof physical activities. Wearable devices have existed for several decades\u2014the\nfirst being the Holter monitor (1962), which records the heart\u2019s rhythm [1,2].\nOver the years, the discovery of new sensor materials, cutting-edge\nfabrication techniques, robust models for sensor data analysis, faster\ncomputation power, and innovative power management solutions have evolved the\ncapabilities of wearable devices, enhancing their reliability and performance\n[3,4].\n\nA wearable device integrates several components, such as sensors,\nmicrocontroller units, transceivers, and power supply. The sensors are used to\nmonitor human physiological parameters, such as heart rate and blood pressure,\nas well as biomarkers, such as glucose, sodium, and other minerals [5,6,7,8].\nThe microcontroller unit collects, processes, and interprets the sensor data.\nThe transceivers transmit useful health information obtained from sensor data\nto a physician, caretaker, sports trainer, rehabilitation therapist, or any\nconcerned individual, depending on the area of application. The power supply\nis another key element needed to operate the entire system. All these\ncomponents determine the efficient working of a wearable device. Recently,\nresearch on wearable devices has advanced into a new era of the Internet of\nHealth Things (IoHT), a cloud platform that integrates various sensor systems\nwith information technology, offering data analysis, storage, and immediate\naction commands for critical situations [9,10,11,12,13,14]. To name a few, the\nIoHT has been implemented to enhance the quality of life for elderly patients,\nprovide local communities with access to emergency medical assistance, and\nenable remote patient monitoring using smartphones [15,16].\n\n#### 1.1. Shoe-Based Human Gait Acquisition\n\nThe mobility or gait of an individual is affected by neurological, orthopedic,\nand musculoskeletal disorders, such as those occurring due to aging, stroke,\ndiabetes, and injuries. Based on the position of sensors and improved machine\nlearning algorithms for signal processing, gait disorder is used as an\nindicator of the advancement of illness, the impact of therapy or sports\ntraining, and fitness tracking [17,18,19,20,21]. The gait disorder outcome is\nobserved in terms of impaired balance, limping, and frequent falls.\nTechnically, gait disorders result in changing stride length, plantar\npressure, and heel and toe strike instants, measured from sensors placed in\nsocks, shoes, or soles [22,23,24]. The most common sensors used in such\nwearable systems are an accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and pressure\nsensor array [25,26,27,28]. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) are quite\npopular for gait analysis. They can provide several pieces of information,\nsuch as specific force, angular rate, and orientation of the subject. To\nsummarize, it involves a combination of an accelerometer, gyroscope, and\nmagnetometer. An IMU or separate accelerometer, gyroscope, or magnetometer is\nusually placed on the thigh, waist, ankle, or knee, attached in a band\n[29,30]. In the work of [31], the optimal location and orientation of an IMU\nsensor on a barefoot were investigated, while [32], explored the placement of\na 3-axis accelerometer and gyroscope on top of the shoe to assess patients\nwith Parkinson\u2019s disease. For shoe-based sensor systems, e-textiles, such as\nsmart socks and insoles, show promise for implementing remote gait monitoring\n[33,34].\n\nThe focus of this article is a shoe-based wearable sensor system, with its\napplication in human gait analysis. A shoe is an ideal choice as it can be\nworn by individuals of all age groups and health conditions. There are several\nscientific investigations on such systems. The authors in [35] examined gait\nwith a combination of two foot sensors and a mobile app (SmartMOVE) to detect\nthe falls of patients suffering from Parkinson\u2019s disease. One of the earliest\nforms of research in this area involved a system used for measuring pressure\ndistribution under the foot. It was conducted with 7 force-sensitive resistors\n(FSRs) to identify between shuffling and walking movements [36,37,38]. Another\ngroup developed a system capable of detecting temporal gait parameters with 2\nFSRs positioned under the foot to detect falls from elderly people and to find\nfluctuations in gait patterns [39,40,41]. Multimodal smart soles were\ndeveloped to investigate gait patterns from different types of sensors for\ndifferent applications. Lechal used inertial sensors to alert visually\nimpaired individuals while Sensoria used textile pressure sensors to avoid\ninjuries for runners [42,43]. A multimodal electronic textile-based pressure\nsensor and a low-cost inertial measurement unit, equipped with a three-axis\naccelerometer, magnetometer, and gyroscope, were integrated into the insole\nfor activity recognition. This setup facilitated long-duration data collection\nfrom subjects [44]. Conductive soft pressure sensor arrays molded inside\nsilicon rubber structures were developed with a focus on the comfort of the\nsubject. This design was implemented to sense plantar pressure parameters in\nboth static and dynamic situations [45]. Similar kinds of customizable\nflexible sensor arrays were proposed in [46,47], where piezo-resistive and\ncapacitive sensors were implemented to acquire plantar pressure distribution.\nIn reference [48], a smart shoe-based platform implemented with a GPS tracker\nwas used to navigate a blind person. Using voice messages, it guided the\nindividual around physical obstacles, fire, water, and potholes. A similar\nkind of idea has also been implemented in boots for real-time monitoring of\nautistic people in the absence of a caretaker [49]. The authors in [50]\nproposed a power-optimized solution for gait monitoring from two\naccelerometers with an improved algorithm.\n\n#### 1.2. Power Management of Smart Shoe Insole\n\nWith the growth of wearable sensor-based devices, there is growing concern\nabout battery management. Most conventional wearable devices are operated by\nbatteries, which have a limited lifespan and need replacement. The replaced\nbatteries, which contain toxic substances, are disposed of in the environment\n[51]. This is alarming and contributes to land pollution. Ensuring a reliable\nand constant power supply in a sustainable approach is a prerequisite of\nmodern wearable devices. Therefore, researchers and scientists are shifting\ntheir focus to alternative power supplies. Ambient energy harvesting options,\nsuch as piezoelectric, thermoelectric, triboelectric, and electromagnetic\nmethods, are possible ways to increase the battery\u2019s lifetime and lower the\nrate of its disposal [52,53,54,55,56]. The human body has the potential to\ncontribute toward renewable energy, making wearable devices like smart shoes\nself-powered. Theoretical calculations estimate that body heat, breathing, and\narm movements can generate 2.8\u20134.8 W, 0.83 W, and 60 W [57], while ambulatory\nfootfall generates 20 W [55,58]. Only a percentage of the estimated power can\nbe converted through thermoelectric, piezoelectric, or inertial energy\nharvesters to operate wearable devices. For example, measurements showed that\na piezoelectric stack actuated by hydraulic amplifiers could generate 150\u2013700\nmW while walking and 600\u20132500 mW while jogging [59]. Depending on the\nharvester design and position, piezoelectric elements can harvest from a few\n\u03bcW to mW [60,61,62,63]. The temperature gradient and ionic imbalance in sweat\nalso represent promising options for batteryless applications [64,65,66,67].\nThe scope of this article is piezoelectric energy harvesting, taking advantage\nof vibration induced by human motion.\n\nThe mechanical vibrations generated while walking, breathing, and muscle\nmovement are promising sources of energy. Human walking and vehicle movement\nhave the potential to harvest energy via piezoelectric elements embedded in\nroads and shoes [68]. Out of the various options, this work explores\npiezoelectric elements for energy harvesting. A group of researchers used a\nlead zirconate titanate (PZT) layer mounted over a stainless steel structure\nwith a spring to generate the effects through compression and relaxation\n[69,70]. In one of their articles, they used this structure to drive a circuit\nto switch on LED in the shoes of workers. They also proposed a self-powered\nsystem without the use of any battery, such that it generated sufficient power\nto drive the transmitter after 8 steps. In another article [71], the authors\ninvestigated mechanical and electrical measures generated at different\npositions of various types of shoes. The wedge-heel type of shoe generated a\nhigh open-circuit voltage and a high short-circuit current at the toe strike,\nwhile the block-heel type of shoe showed the same at the heel strike. It\nshowed that larger-sized piezoelectric elements generated more energy, and\nincreasing the speed of walking increased the force exerted by the foot.\nAnother energy harvester with 2 piezoelectric cantilever beams\u2014each with 2\nratchets, a gear, an arc rack, a spring, 2 axles, 4 bearings, and 2 one-way\nbearings\u2014was proposed in [72]. The main objective of this arrangement was to\nincrease high power peaks in each gait cycle. The authors in [73] proposed a\nhexagon structure with polylactide thermoplastic using parallel links of\npiezoelectric harvesters. This design optimization increased the output to\n1.29 mW of power. The sole optimization, e.g., stainless steel in [69] and\nparallel links in [73], improved the harvested output but made the shoes\nuncomfortable to wear and move around. In another work, a maximum power point\ntracking (MPPT) circuit interface was implemented to improve the harvested\npower from daily walking for gait monitoring insole [74].\n\n#### 1.3. Proposed Work\n\nIn most articles, sensing and energy harvesting are separately investigated,\nwhereas, in our work, we investigate both sensing and energy harvesting\nembedded together in a shoe sole. In conventional human gait acquisition\napplications, an accelerometer is a common choice for collecting gait\ninformation while an array of piezoelectric elements is used to generate a\nplantar pressure map. The proposed work is different from the conventional\napproach. It explores the potential and limits of a piezoelectric element for\ngait acquisition and activity recognition. Two strategies, namely Strategy 1\nand Strategy 2, are presented in this article based on the sensor choice. The\naccelerometer is chosen in Strategy 1 and the piezoelectric element is chosen\nin Strategy 2 to acquire sensing data. The same low-cost piezoelectric\nelements are used as ambient energy harvesters embedded in shoes to generate\nenergy while walking. This research investigates the extent to which such\nharvesters can support the operation of smart shoe applications and reduce\ndependency on batteries for a specific set of sensor functionalities.\n\nFor any system-based application\u2014an energy-autonomous shoe, in our\ncase\u2014several elements coordinate to achieve the objective. The highlight of\nthis work is to achieve simultaneous sensing and energy harvesting with a\ncomprehensive approach. Low-power electronic components are chosen and the\nsole design is improved for better electromechanical conversion. The comfort\nof a shoe sole and the affordable cost of the components are also taken into\nconsideration for experimental demonstration. This article compares both\nstrategies, in terms of their power consumption and sensing accuracy for a\nsmart shoe application. The stage-wise power consumption study of each\ncomponent is important for an energy-autonomous operation. For both\nstrategies, this article provides an overview of a detailed understanding of\nthe power consumption in sensor data acquisition, processing, and\ntransmission. The novelty is that the piezoelectric elements in Strategy 2\noffer a power-optimized method and an alternative accelerometer choice for\nlifestyle wearables. This approach is particularly appealing given the growing\ninterest in utilizing ambient energy harvesters to extend battery life and\nslow down the rate of battery disposal.\n\n## 2\\. System Design\n\nFigure 1 shows the block diagram of the two strategies. It constitutes (1) a\nsensor (accelerometer in Strategy 1 and piezoelectric element in Strategy 2),\n(2) a microcontroller unit, (3) a data transmission module, (4) an array of\nfive piezoelectric energy harvesters, each with a rectifier, (5) a voltage\nregulator, and (6) a switch. The rectifier, voltage regulator, and switch\ntogether comprised the interface circuit. A voltage divider is added in\nStrategy 2 (check Figure 1b) as protection against voltage spikes. A battery\nis also added as a backup in both strategies. The impact of the battery in\nboth strategies will be discussed at the end of the article. Low-power\ncomponents are chosen for the experiment to ensure low current consumption and\nextend battery life.\n\nFigure 1. System design: (a) Strategy 1 and (b) Strategy 2.\n\n#### 2.1. Sensor\n\nA 3-axis MEMS accelerometer ADXL362 (denoted as ACC) [75] is placed on top of\na shoe on a circuit board, such that its Y-axis is aligned with the forward\nwalking direction of the subject. The measurement range of ACC is \u00b12 g, \u00b14 g,\nand \u00b18 g. The sampling frequency in this design is set to the lowest value of\n12.5 Hz. The upper limit of the FIFO buffer is set to 300 samples, which\nimplies that the ACC uploads data every 8 s for each axis. It is switched\nbetween two operating modes\u2014measurement and wake-up. The wake-up mode reduces\npower consumption until an activity is detected based on a defined threshold.\nIf an activity is detected, the ACC sends an \u2018interrupt\u2019 to the\nmicrocontroller to record the measurement via the SPI interface.\n\nFigure 2 shows the piezoelectric element implemented in this study. It was\npurchased from Murata Electronics [76]. It is a brass disc with a PZT layer on\ntop of it and coated with a silver electrode. The same element was used for\nsensing and energy harvesting. It was placed under the foot to experience the\npressure while walking. In further discussion, it will be denoted as PZT.\n\nFigure 2. Piezoelectric sensor (all dimensions are in mm).\n\n#### 2.2. Microcontroller Unit (MCU)\n\nThe MSP430FR5947, manufactured by Texas Instruments, is used as a\nmicrocontroller unit due to its ultra-low power system architecture [77]. It\noperates at 1.8 to 3.6 V and consumes a maximum of 1.3 \u03bcA under normal\noperation in a low-power mode. The power consumption is minimized by disabling\nregisters on the MCU, supporting several low-power modes, according to the\nneeds of different applications. It will further be denoted as MSP430.\n\n#### 2.3. Data Transmission Module\n\nThe data obtained from the sensors were transmitted to the MSP430 by Bluetooth\nDA14531 [78]. It is the world\u2019s smallest and lowest-power Bluetooth 5.1\nsystem-on-chip (SoC). It operates at a battery voltage range from 1.1 to 3.3\nV, with a receiver sensitivity of \u221294 dBm. Its programmable transmit output\npower ranges from \u221220 dBm to +2.5 dBm. The current consumption of the\ntransmitter is 3.5 mA at 0 dBm and that of the receiver is 2.2 mA at an input\nvoltage of 3 V. It will be denoted as \u2018BLE Broadcaster\u2019 in further\ndiscussions.\n\nThe data transmission starts as soon as the Bluetooth interrupt is triggered\nand the timer is set. It starts to broadcast the data received from the MSP430\nthrough the UART bus at a broadcast interval of 1.5 s. When the timer\noverflows, the Bluetooth chip turns off all the peripherals, except the wake-\nup \u2018interrupt\u2019, and enters sleep mode to ensure minimum power consumption.\n\n#### 2.4. Piezoelectric Energy Harvesters\n\nThe same element in Figure 2 is used as the energy harvester. A silicone\nrubber structure in the shape of a sole with dimensions of 95 mm \u00d7 240 mm is\ndesigned to host the harvesters. The piezoelectric elements are placed on the\nlayout as shown in Figure 3. The numeric denotations 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are the\npositions of the energy harvesters while S is the position of the PZT used for\nsensing purposes. The position of each element is chosen in such a way that,\nas the foot strikes the ground, all of them also strike the ground. Detailed\ninformation about the sole design can be found in Section 5.2.2 of [79]. The\ninsole design is flexible and comfortable but unbreakable while walking. It\nalso ensured the protection of the solder joints of PZT elements and improved\ntheir durability.\n\nFigure 3. Positions of 6 piezoelectric elements on the sole layout.\n\n#### 2.5. Interface Circuit\n\nThe interface circuit is composed of three parts: rectifier, voltage\nregulator, and switch.\n\n#### 2.5.1. Rectifier\n\nA full bridge standard energy harvesting circuit (SEH) is used to rectify the\npiezoelectric voltage, , generated while walking. It consists of 4 diodes\narranged as a wheat-stone bridge, a filter capacitor, , and an equivalent\nresistance of the terminal load, , as shown in Figure 4. In our published\narticle [80], a PZT element was connected to the SEH circuit, and 5 of such\nSEH circuits when connected in parallel gave more output power than other\nnonlinear rectifier circuits. Therefore, we implemented the full bridge\nrectifier circuit in this work.\n\nFigure 4. Rectifier circuit.\n\n#### 2.5.2. Voltage Regulator\n\nThe nano buck\u2013boost converter LTC3331 is used to regulate the harvested output\nat a desired voltage [81]. It also acts as a battery charger and has a low\nbattery disconnect function that protects the battery from deep discharge. The\nharvested energy is used to power the MSP430 and charge the battery. When\nharvested energy is not available, the LTC3331 uses the battery as the source\nto drive the load.\n\n#### 2.5.3. Switch\n\nFigure 5 shows a switch circuit, which consists of an R-C network and an\nN-channel MOSFET. It is implemented to let the LTC3331 attain its rated output\nvoltage first and then drive the load. The power good () pin of the LTC3331\ndecides when to turn on the MOSFET. Until the output of LTC3331 is below its\nrated voltage, is low. is high when the of the LTC3331 reaches its rated\nvoltage. This switch ensures that the system is cold-started on its own\nwithout any manual contribution.\n\nFigure 5. Switch circuit.\n\n#### 2.6. Final System Design\n\nThe PCB schematics and final boards are shown in Figure 6. The seven parts of\nthe board are highlighted in both the sub-figures. The proposed sole layout\nplaced inside the shoe is shown in Figure 7.\n\nFigure 6. (a) PCB schematic and (b) final board. 1: Rectifier circuit for 5\nPZT elements; 2: voltage regulator; 3: accelerometer; 4: switch circuit; 5:\nmicrocontroller unit; 6: data transmission module; 7: voltage divider; 8:\nbatter pin.\n\nFigure 7. (a) Final sole layout and (b) Real prototype.\n\n## 3\\. Sensor Data Acquisition\n\nThis section is divided into 2 subsections: Strategy 1 and Strategy 2.\n\n#### 3.1. Strategy 1: Accelerometer plus BLE Broadcaster\n\nThe communication in Strategy 1 is shown as block diagrams in Figure 8. It\nonly has 2 interrupt signals: overflow and BLE. The overflow interrupt of ACC\nimplies that its FIFO sample register has collected 100 sets of samples for\neach of the three axes. At that instant, the data are extracted and processed\nby MSP430, and after processing, they return to the low-power mode. Then, the\nMSP430 calls the BLE \u2018interrupt\u2019 to send advertising packets, facilitating the\ntransmission of the processed data to the subject\u2019s mobile phone. The MSP430\nsends the processed data to the Bluetooth chip through the UART bus.\n\nFigure 8. Block diagram: Strategy 1.\n\nBefore the algorithm of ACC signal processing is defined, different types of\nactivities are captured and graphically presented. The reference axis of\nacceleration data for activity recognition is presented in the bottom right.\nIn Figure 9, an activity is identified by the peak and time intervals between\nany two consecutive peaks. Two activities are mainly detected: walking and\nrunning. The up climb and down climb are considered as walking, i.e., we\nassume Figure 9a,c,d as walking. However, the pattern of the Y-axis\nacceleration changes for the up climb, which we will discuss later. The walk,\nrun, up climb, and down climb actions are based on Y-axis acceleration (as\ndepicted by green graphs). The number of peaks implies the activities. The\nacceleration values of the run are higher than those of the walk. Therefore, a\ndifferent threshold is set for Y-acceleration to distinguish between walking\nand running. It is critical that for every step taken to walk uphill, two\nconsecutive peaks occur as shown in Figure 9d. The peak detection of such\nconsecutive peaks would double the number of steps. As a result, the up climb\nis detected by 2 conditions\u2014the Y-axis acceleration threshold and the time\ninterval between consecutive peaks. Due to physical movement, additional noise\nis added to the acceleration results, which affects the accuracy of activity\nrecognition. A threshold value is also set to eliminate noise, such that\nacceleration peaks lower than this threshold are ignored.\n\nFigure 9. Y-axis acceleration for (a) walk, (b) run, (c) down climb, and (d)\nup climb.\n\n#### 3.2. Strategy 2: Piezoelectric Sensor + BLE Broadcaster\n\n#### Gait Signal\n\nA typical gait signal is shown in Figure 10. It is recorded from a\npiezoelectric element placed on the heel of a shoe. The power graph is\ncalculated based on its intrinsic resistance. There is no other electrical\nload connected to it. The above measurement is recorded before the elements\nare embedded in the silicone layout mentioned above. As shown, it has an\nasymmetric positive spike with a peak power of about 1.2 mW. On the one hand,\nthe gait signal needs to be regulated for a stable operation, which is\nconducted by the LTC3331. On the other hand, the spikes denote the number of\nsteps taken by an individual. Thus, the same signal provides sensor\ninformation and is implemented for energy harvesting.\n\nFigure 10. A typical gait signal from one piezoelectric element.\n\nThe communication in Strategy 2 is shown as block diagrams in Figure 11. It\ndiscusses the implementation of the piezoelectric sensor in the proposed work.\nThe GPIO port of the MSP430 detects the rising edge and the falling edge. As a\npiezoelectric element is pressed while walking, the interrupt function detects\nsuch an edge of the voltage across the PZT. This triggers an interrupt, which\nturns on the timer. The timer records the value of the instant when a peak is\ngenerated and the time interval between two interrupts is stored. Based on the\ntime interval, only run or walk activities are recognized. Unlike the ACC, PZT\nprovides only uniaxial information that is sufficient for the detection of\nwalk-and-run activities. To recognize the jump activity, the force applied on\nPZT has to be determined. The jump activity recognition from the piezoelectric\nelement depends on the force exerted while walking. The force generated by\neach activity corresponds to the voltage. The accurate PZT voltage can be\nmeasured by the ADC module of MSP430. However, the use of the ADC module is\nrestricted to lower computational power consumption.\n\nFigure 11. Block diagram: Strategy 2.\n\n#### 3.3. Power Calculation\n\nThe power measurement is based on the current measured by the Nordic Power\nProfiler Kit [82] and the operating voltage of the system. The equation\nfollowed for the power calculation is as follows:\n\nwhere the current is obtained from the kit and the voltage is 3.3 V.\n\n#### 3.4. Accuracy Calculation\n\nThe accuracy of sensor data acquisition is calculated by the ratio of recorded\nto actual activities, i.e.,\n\nThe is the difference between the actual and recorded activity. It is divided\nby 2 because two activities are considered. is the activity manually observed\nand is considered ground truth for reference.\n\n## 4\\. Results and Discussion\n\n#### 4.1. Power Consumption during Data Acquisition, Processing and\nTransmission\n\nThe power consumption of the proposed system has two phases, namely, (a) Phase\n1: data acquisition and processing by MSP430, and (b) Phase 2: data\ntransmission by the BLE broadcaster.\n\nFigure 12 shows the power consumption of the two strategies for the first\nphase. In Strategy 1, when the ACC collects sufficient samples, the MSP430\nextracts data through serial communication and processes it. At this moment,\nthe power consumption reaches a peak at 4.5 mW for a short instant of 0.38 s\nand then drops (see Figure 12a). The average power consumption of the system\nfor every gait cycle is about 0.56 mW. In Strategy 2, the peak power\nconsumption is about 1.3 mW, and the average power for the entire 50 s period\nis 0.6 mW (Figure 12b). The distributed pressure under the foot generates\nnoise. Each noise wakes up the MSP430 from the low-power mode, which results\nin a higher average power of the PZT than the ACC. However, the peak power\nconsumption in Strategy 2 is less than one-third of that of Strategy 1.\n\nFigure 12. Power consumption of data acquisition and processing of (a)\nStrategy 1 and (b) Strategy 2.\n\nFigure 13a shows the power consumption of the data transmission by the BLE\nbroadcaster. As the same data transmission module is implemented, the power\nconsumption for this function remains the same for both strategies. Its\naverage power consumption is 0.66 mW for the advertising interval of 1.5 s and\nthe peak power consumption is about 7 mW for 0.02 s. The critical situation\noccurs during the peak instant. If not advertising, the broadcaster is in a\nsleep state, ensuring low power consumption. Figure 13b shows the power\nconsumption at the advertising moment. The first peak represents the\nbroadcaster that is woken up from the sleep state. The next three peaks occur\nwhen it broadcasts data to channels 37, 38, and 39, respectively, after which,\nit returns to sleep mode. To further lower the power consumption in data\ntransmission, the BLE broadcaster can be dropped and sensor data can be\nobtained from UART mode.\n\nFigure 13. Power consumption of data transmission: (a) Strategy 1 and 2; (b)\nfirst advertising instant.\n\nThere is additional power required to operate the ACC, which leads to an\nincrease in the overall power consumption in Strategy 1. The PZT needs no such\nexternal power to operate. Its power consumption in Strategy 2 could be\nfurther minimized by avoiding the timer but its removal would fail to achieve\nthe activity recognition and perform only step counting like a pedometer.\n\n#### 4.2. Accuracy Comparison of Both Strategies\n\nTable 1 and Table 2 show the accuracies of both strategies based on the two\ntypes of sensors used. The ACC and PZT identify two different types of\nactivity recognition. Strategy 2 is proposed in a way that the energy\nharvested while walking can deliver enough output to operate its mentioned\nfunctionalities. The accuracy of PZT is about 10% less than that of ACC. Due\nto dispersive plantar pressure distribution, the algorithm misinterprets noise\nand detects it as the peak.\n\nTable 1. Accuracy of activity recognition with the accelerometer.\n\nTable 2. Accuracy of activity recognition with a piezoelectric sensor.\n\n#### 4.3. Output of Interface Circuit\n\nFigure 14 shows that the LTC3331 output achieves the desired voltage around\nthe same instant in both strategies. Taking advantage of a Power Good signal\nin the switch circuit, the MOSFET ensures that the LTC3331 achieves the\ndesired voltage before driving the load.\n\nFigure 14. Output of LTC3331 with an additional battery of (a) Strategy 1 and\n(b) Strategy 2.\n\nFigure 15 shows the LTC3331 output without an additional battery. Figure 15a\nshows that in Strategy 1, after the 8th step, the LTC3331 output reaches an\nunstable voltage of peak 2.8 V and then drops to 0.9 V. As it fails to achieve\nthe desired 3.3 V and lower operating limit of the MSP430, i.e., 1.8 V, it is\nunable to initialize itself and the ACC peripherals. However, the collection\nof gait data is possible in Strategy 2. Figure 15b shows that the LTC3331\noutput achieves the desired value of 3.3 V and drops to 1.8 V. As 1.8 V is the\nlowest operating voltage of the MSP430, Strategy 2 can work with the\nfluctuating voltage. Therefore, Strategy 2 can perform two types of activity\nrecognition without requiring an additional battery. It is clear from Figure\n14 and Figure 15 that a battery acts as a backup storage capacitor. It\nprovides a stable voltage supply to the system and possibly improves the\naccuracy of sensor data acquisition.\n\nFigure 15. Output of LTC3331 without an additional battery of (a) Strategy 1\nand (b) Strategy 2.\n\nFigure 10 shows that one element produces about 1.2 mW of peak power and 0.7\nmW of average power. Therefore, with 5 of such elements, about 5\u20136 mW of peak\nand 3.5 mW of average power can be generated. This is sufficient for the peak\npower consumption of Phase 1, i.e., data acquisition and processing by MSP430,\nwhich is only 4.5 mW in Strategy 1 and 1.3 mW in Strategy 2 (ref Figure 12).\nIn the data transmission phase, a peak power demand of 7.3 mW is required for\n0.02 s (ref Figure 13). It is during this time that the battery is needed for\na short period. The interface circuit is designed to utilize the extra\nharvested energy to charge the battery. Consequently, the battery does not\nrequire an external power supply for charging, making the system energy-\nautonomous. To make it batteryless and energy-autonomous, the data\ntransmission module can be replaced with the UART mode.\n\n## 5\\. Conclusions\n\nIn this work, an energy-autonomous smart shoe system with energy harvesting,\nactivity recognition, and wireless connectivity was successfully designed,\nbuilt, and experimented with. It presents a comprehensive study of stage-wise\npower consumption, constituting components, the accuracy of sensor data, and\nthe impact of energy harvested from walking. Two strategies were discussed\nbased on the choice of the sensor. Strategy 1 uses ACC as a sensor, which is\nthe most common choice for the gait acquisition system, and Strategy 2 uses\nPZT for the same. The choice of the sensor determines the power consumption in\nthe data acquisition and processing, as well as the overall accuracy of the\nobtained data. The power consumption in the wireless data transmission phase\nis the same for both strategies. It is the most power-hungry part of the\nproposed design, with a peak power of around 7 mW, making it critical to\noperate as a batteryless application. To reduce the dependency on batteries or\nexternal power supply, low-cost PZT elements are implemented to harvest energy\nand charge the battery in both strategies.\n\nThe comparison between the two strategies is presented in Table 3. It shows\nthe trade-off between accuracy and energy consumption. Strategy 2 opens up an\nideal technique to use PZT for simultaneous sensing and energy harvesting. It\nis apparent that Strategy 1 has a higher average accuracy than that of\nStrategy 2. However, with the growing demand for wearable and battery disposal\nconcerns, power optimization is a basic necessity of any electronic wearable\nsystem design. One attractive feature of Strategy 2 is its low power\nconsumption in data acquisition and processing, which is about one-third of\nthat of Strategy 1. Unlike an ACC, a PZT does not require any external power\nsupply to operate. Another attractive feature of Strategy 2 is the high peak-\ncharging current per step, i.e., 75 A/step, compared to Strategy 1. This\ncurrent is used to charge the battery. The power optimization in Strategy 2,\nby a few W\u2013mW, contributes to a significant value when billions of such\nsystems are commercialized at a large scale. The use of PZT elements as energy\nharvesters minimizes the dependency on the external power supply and increases\nthe lifetime of the battery. Nevertheless, it ultimately depends on the\npreferences of users on whether to opt for accuracy or low power consumption.\nFor trending lifestyle applications, where accuracy is not a significant\nconcern, PZT as a sensor and energy harvester is a promising choice.\n\nTable 3. Power consumption of Strategy 1 and 2.\n\nThe output of piezoelectric elements in the proposed application depends on\nseveral factors. One important factor that improves energy harvesting is its\nelectromechanical conversion efficiency, which is determined by the type of\nmaterial and sole layout, where the elements are embedded. As material\nsynthesis is beyond the expertise of the authors, low-cost, lightweight\ncommercial elements are considered. Within the scope of the authors, a silicon\nrubber sole layout is designed to ensure the comfort of the subject, and low-\npower electronic components are chosen. The microcontroller unit\n(MSP430FR5947) and voltage regulator (LTC3331) implemented in the study have\nlow power consumption. With all these considerations, a power-optimized\napproach for an energy-autonomous shoe is proposed.\n\n## Author Contributions\n\nConceptualization: N.G.; methodology, investigation: Y.Z. and N.G.; writing\nand editing: N.G.; review: J.K. and G.F.; supervision: G.F.
