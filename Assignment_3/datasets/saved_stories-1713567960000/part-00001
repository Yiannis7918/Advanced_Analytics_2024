The move comes days\nafter the UK government announced plans for a new law that will make creating\nnon-consensual deepfakes a criminal offense.\n\nNon-consensual deepfake pornography websites and apps that \u201cstrip\u201d clothes off\nof photos have been growing at an alarming rate\u2014causing untold harm to the\nthousands of women they are used to target.\n\nClare McGlynn, a professor at Durham University\u2019s Law School, says the move is\na \u201chugely significant moment\u201d in the fight against deepfake abuse. \u201cThis ends\nthe easy access and the normalization of deepfake sexual abuse material,\"\nMcGlynn tells WIRED.\n\nFeatured Video\n\nSince deepfake technology first emerged in December 2017, it has consistently\nbeen used to create non-consensual sexual images of women\u2014swapping their faces\ninto pornographic videos or allowing new \u201cnude\u201d images to be generated. As the\ntechnology has improved and become easier to access, hundreds of websites and\napps have been created. Most recently, school children have been caught\ncreating nudes of classmates.\n\nThe blocks on the deepfake websites in the UK were first spotted today, with\ntwo of the most prominent services displaying notices on their landing pages\nthat they are no longer accessible to people visiting from the country. WIRED\nis not naming the two websites due to their enabling of abuse.\n\nOne of the websites with the restriction in place is the biggest deepfake\npornography website existing today. On its homepage, when visiting from the\nUK, it displays a message saying access is denied. \u201cDue to laws or (upcoming)\nlegislation in your country or state, we are unfortunately obligated to deny\nyou access to this website,\u201d the message says. It also shows the visitor\u2019s IP\naddress and country.\n\nThe other website, which also has an app, displays a similar message. \u201cAccess\nto the service in your country is blocked,\u201d it says, before hinting there may\nbe ways to get around the geographic restriction. The websites do not appear\nto have any restrictions in place when visiting from the United States,\nalthough may also be restricted in other countries.\n\nIt is not immediately clear why the sites have introduced the location blocks\nor whether they have done so in response to any legal orders or notices. Nor\nis it clear if the blocks are temporary. Messages sent to the websites,\nthrough email addresses and contact forms, went unanswered. The creators of\nthe websites have not posted any public messages on the websites or their\nsocial media channels about the blocks.\n\nOfcom, the UK\u2019s communications regulator, has the power to tackle action\nagainst harmful websites under the UK\u2019s controversial sweeping online safety\nlaws that came into force last year. However, these powers are not yet fully\noperational and it is consulting on them.\n\nIt\u2019s likely the restrictions may significantly limit the amount of people in\nthe UK seeking out or trying to create deepfake sexual abuse content. Data\nfrom Similarweb, a digital intelligence company, shows the biggest of the two\nwebsites had 12 million global visitors last month, while the other website\nhad 4 million visitors. In the UK, they had around 500,000 and 50,000\nvisitors, respectively.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Security\n\nHackers Linked to Russia\u2019s Military Claim Credit for Sabotaging US Water\nUtilities\n\nAndy Greenberg\n\n  * Security\n\nThe Real-Time Deepfake Romance Scams Have Arrived\n\nMatt Burgess\n\n  * Business\n\nGoogle Fires 28 Workers for Protesting Cloud Deal With Israel\n\nCaroline Haskins\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Rise of the Carbon Farmer\n\nJessica Rawnsley\n\nThis week, politicians in the UK announced plans for an upcoming law that\ncriminalizes the creation of non-consensual deepfakes. Under the law, which is\nyet to be passed, people could face an unlimited fine if they create deepfakes\nto \u201ccause alarm, humiliation or distress to the victim.\u201d This builds on\nprevious provisions that make it illegal for people in the UK to share\nsexualized deepfakes.\n\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s unclear if these platforms have been ordered to block UK access or\nhave done so proactively due to the recent criminalization, it shows\nlegislation can make a meaningful difference in removing the legal ambiguity\nthat many deepfake pornography platforms use as cover for the clear ethical\nharms they cause,\u201d Henry Adjer, an AI and deepfake expert tells WIRED. Adjer\nadds that search engines and hosting providers around the world should be\ndoing more to limit the spread and creation of harmful deepfakes.\n\nWhile the two websites can still be accessed in the UK using a VPN, the\nrestrictions are a sign that constant pressure\u2014from lawmakers, tech companies,\nand campaigners\u2014can make deepfake porn harder to access and create. \u201cOf\ncourse, people will be able to use VPN to access these websites and apps, but\nthat introduces friction,\u201d Durham University\u2019s McGlynn says. \u201cIt introduces a\nmessage that there\u2019s something wrong and harmful about this material such that\nyou have to use a VPN to access it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHopefully,\u201d McGlynn adds, \u201cthis can show other governments around the world\nthat if we take steps we could actually reduce the prevalence and easy access\nto detect sexual abuse material.\u201d\n\n## You Might Also Like ...\n\n  * Navigate election season with our Politics Lab newsletter and podcast\n\n  * Think Google\u2019s \u201cIncognito mode\u201d protects your privacy?
