Not\nthat she felt bad. In fact, sleeping just four hours a night left her feeling\nfull of energy and with free time to get more done at her job leading a\nresearch lab that studies bacteria. \u201cIt feels really good for me to sleep four\nhours,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I\u2019m in that rhythm, that\u2019s when I feel my best.\u201d\n\nStill, in an effort to match the slumber schedules of the rest of the world,\nshe would sometimes drug herself\u2013with melatonin, alcohol or marijuana\nedibles\u2013into getting more sleep. It backfired. \u201cIf I sleep seven or eight\nhours, I feel way worse,\u201d she says. \u201cHung over, almost.\u201d\n\nAlthough the federal government recommends that Americans sleep seven or more\nhours per night for optimal health and functioning, new research is\nchallenging the assumption that sleep is a one-size-fits-all phenomenon.\nScientists have found that our internal body clocks vary so greatly that they\ncould form the next frontiers of personalized medicine. By listening more\nclosely to the ticking of our internal clocks, researchers expect to uncover\nnovel ways to help everybody get more out of their sleeping and waking lives.\n\nSearching for a good night\u2019s rest? Find it by signing up for TIME\u2019s guide to\nthe scientific secrets of sleep.\n\nHuman sleep is largely a mystery. We know it\u2019s important; getting too little\nis linked to heightened risk for metabolic disorders, Type 2 diabetes,\npsychiatric disorders, autoimmune disease, neurodegeneration and many types of\ncancer. \u201cIt\u2019s probably true that bad sleep leads to increased risks of\nvirtually every disorder,\u201d says Dr. Louis Ptacek, a neurology professor at the\nUniversity of California, San Francisco (UCSF). But details about what\u2019s\nactually going on during shut-eye are sparse. \u201cWe know almost nothing about\nsleep and how it\u2019s regulated,\u201d says Ptacek.\n\nSome people are morning larks, rising early, and others are night owls, who\nlike staying up late. Those patterns are regulated by the body\u2019s circadian\nrhythm, a 24-hour internal clock. People can manipulate their circadian rhythm\nthrough all kinds of external factors, like setting an alarm clock or exposing\nthemselves to light. But the ideal sleep duration has long been thought to be\nuniversal. \u201cThere are many people who think everyone needs eight to eight and\na half hours of sleep per night and there will be health consequences if they\ndon\u2019t get it,\u201d says Ptacek. \u201cBut that\u2019s as crazy as saying everybody has to be\n5 ft. 10 in. tall. It\u2019s just not true.\u201d\n\nPtacek and his wife Ying-Hui Fu, also a professor of neurology at UCSF, are\npioneers in the relatively new field of sleep genetics. About a decade ago, Fu\ndiscovered the first human gene linked to natural short sleep; people who had\na rare genetic mutation seemed to get the same benefits from six hours of\nsleep a night as those without the mutation got from eight hours. In 2019, Fu\nand Ptacek discovered two more genes connected to natural short sleep, and\nthey\u2019ll soon submit a paper describing a fourth, providing even more evidence\nthat functioning well on less sleep is a genetic trait.\n\nThe researchers are now collecting data on short sleepers in order to figure\nout just how rare these mutations are. \u201cIf we can get a better understanding\nof why their sleep is more efficient, we can then come back and help everybody\nsleep more efficiently,\u201d Fu says. Among the participants is Chou, who also\nhappens to work at UCSF. One day at a faculty meeting, she and Ptacek chatted\nabout his work. She immediately recognized herself when he described short\nsleepers. \u201cI had never heard of this. But once I started reading about it, it\nwas sort of an epiphany.\u201d\n\nChou doesn\u2019t know yet if she has the identified genetic variants. But after\nthe researchers interviewed her about her family\u2019s sleeping patterns, she\nrealized her mom is also a short sleeper. \u201cI have memories of when I was\nyounger, and my dad being frustrated with her for staying up really late, but\nshe always seemed fine,\u201d she says. The researchers took blood samples from\nboth women.\n\nDoctors once dismissed short sleepers like Chou as depressed or suffering from\ninsomnia. Yet short sleepers may actually have an edge over everyone else.\nResearch is still early, but Fu has found that besides being more efficient at\nsleep, they tend to be more energetic and optimistic and have a higher\ntolerance for pain than people who need to spend more time in bed. They also\ntend to live longer. Chou says the first three hold true for her; by nature,\nshe is sunny and positive, and though she often finds bruises on her body, she\nusually doesn\u2019t remember getting them. \u201cI find it annoying how much people\ncomplain about little physical pains,\u201d she says.\n\nSo far, these are just intriguing observations. But by studying genetic short\nsleepers, Fu and Ptacek believe they\u2019ll eventually learn lessons for the rest\nof us. \u201cAs we identify more and more genes and we think about the pathways in\nwhich they function, at some point, a picture is going to emerge, and we will\nbegin to have an understanding of how sleep is regulated in greater detail,\u201d\nPtacek says. This, they hope, will lead to targeted treatments, like pills or\nvitamins, to improve sleep efficiency in everyone.\n\nResearchers are also looking beyond sleep to other circadian bodily processes\nthat might benefit from a personalized or targeted approach. While a master\nclock in the brain acts like a conductor, setting time for the whole body, the\nrest of the body is like orchestra players with clocks of their own. \u201cAll your\norgans have rhythms,\u201d says Steven Lockley, an associate professor of medicine\nat Harvard Medical School who studies circadian rhythms and sleep. \u201cThere\u2019s a\nclock in your heart, a clock in the lungs, a clock in the kidneys.\u201d Just about\neverything in the body\u2013metabolism, hormones, the immune system, reproductive\nfunction and the way DNA is translated\u2013is influenced by a circadian rhythm, he\nsays.\n\nAnd not everybody\u2019s is the same. People\u2019s internal clocks are often hours off\nfrom one another, Lockley says. \u201cThe range of individual differences is much\nbigger than anyone really understands yet.\u201d\n\nThe body\u2019s complex clock system has implications for both healthy people and\nthose with medical conditions, and scientists are already seeing glimpses of\nhow they can time certain tests and treatments to get more accurate or potent\nresults. A cholesterol reading, for example, might be affected by what time of\nday you go to the doctor\u2019s office, because the liver (which makes cholesterol)\nhas a circadian rhythm. \u201cThe time of day at which you measure something could\nmake someone look clinically abnormal, even though they\u2019re not,\u201d Lockley says.\n\nMedicine might also be more effective if taken at a certain time. Because\nthey\u2019re metabolized in the liver, \u201cdrugs change their effects throughout the\nday,\u201d Lockley says. Other circadian bodily processes, like cell function, can\nalso affect how medication acts. Early research suggests certain\ndrugs\u2013including some for colorectal cancer, pain and asthma\u2013perform better or\nare less toxic when taken at different times of day.\n\nExercise, which can be as powerful as medicine for some conditions, is good\nfor you whenever you do it. \u201cBut I do think that the time of day may have an\ninfluence, on top of the effects of exercise, on our metabolic health,\u201d says\nJuleen Zierath, professor of physiology at Karolinska Institute in Sweden. In\none small study published in 2018 in the journal Diabetologia, Zierath and her\nteam started 11 men with Type 2 diabetes on a high-intensity interval training\nprogram. The men exercised either in the morning (around 8 a.m.) or the\nafternoon (4 p.m.) for two weeks, then switched schedules. The researchers\nexpected that regardless of the time of day, men in both groups would see\nimprovements in blood-sugar levels. But \u201cwhen they exercised in the morning,\nthey actually had slightly higher levels of blood sugar [than baseline], which\nwe didn\u2019t expect at all,\u201d Zierath says. It\u2019s not clear to what extent the type\nof exercise and other variables matter, but the study provides an intriguing\nhint that time of day might make a difference for exercise.\n\nScientific knowledge is nascent when it comes to optimizing testing and\ntreatment by the clock. Our understanding of individual circadian time is even\nmore primitive. But Lockley believes it\u2019s the key to personalized medicine; he\nand others are exploring ways to measure a person\u2019s internal circadian time\nthrough simple clinical tests. \u201cHopefully in the next five to 10 years, you\u2019d\ngo to the doctor, give a breath test or a pee sample, and the doctor would\nknow your biological time,\u201d he says. \u201cThen all your test results and\ntreatments could be based on your real internal time, which is going to be\nvery different between you and me based on our internal clocks.\u201d\n\nFor now, even the understanding that our bodies often operate according to\ndifferent clocks is a big scientific advance. It\u2019s already changed the way\nChou sleeps, lives and works. \u201cI\u2019ve just become more comfortable with\naccepting my sleep,\u201d she says. She now asks her employees about their sleep\nschedules to anticipate when each will be at their peak. She also informs\neveryone about her own abbreviated schedule, so they know she doesn\u2019t expect\nan immediate response to an email she sends at 4:05 a.m. \u201cThat\u2019s just when my\nbrain is working,\u201d she says.\n\n## More Must-Reads From TIME\n\n  * Exclusive: Google Workers Revolt Over $1.2 Billion Contract With Israel\n  * Jane Fonda Champions Climate Action for Every Generation\n  * Stop Looking for Your Forever Home\n  * The Sympathizer Counters 50 Years of Hollywood Vietnam War Narratives\n  * The Bliss of Seeing the Eclipse From Cleveland\n  * Hormonal Birth Control Doesn\u2019t Deserve Its Bad Reputation\n  * The Best TV Shows to Watch on Peacock\n  * Want Weekly Recs on What to Watch, Read, and More?
