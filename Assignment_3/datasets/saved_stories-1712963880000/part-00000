This latest round of debt cancellation comes on the heels of\nPresident Biden announcing new plans that, if implemented, would cancel\nstudent debt for over 30 million Americans when combined with actions the\nAdministration has taken over the last three years. This week\u2019s announcements\nreinforce the President\u2019s commitment to using every path available to deliver\nstudent debt relief to as many borrowers as possible through various actions.\n\nThe 277,000 Americans receiving this latest round of debt relief are borrowers\nenrolled in the SAVE Plan, other borrowers enrolled in Income-Driven Repayment\nplans, and borrowers receiving Public Service Loan Forgiveness. The Biden-\nHarris Administration fixed Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) and launched the\nSAVE Plan last year \u2013 the most affordable repayment plan ever. Already 8\nmillion borrowers are enrolled in SAVE, 4.5 million of those borrowers have a\nmonthly payment of $0, and over 1 million additional borrowers have a monthly\npayment of less than $100. And if borrowers took out low balances of loans,\nthe SAVE Plan puts them on a faster path to debt relief after at least ten\nyears of payments.\n\nSince President Biden took office, his Administration has approved over $54\nbillion in debt cancellation for 1.3 million borrowers enrolled in income-\ndriven repayment plans, including the new SAVE Plan. This builds on additional\nactions the Biden-Harris Administration has taken to cancel debt for nearly\n900,000 public service workers, 1.3 million borrowers cheated by their schools\nor borrowers covered by related court settlements, and nearly 550,000\nborrowers with a total and permanent disability, including many veterans.\n\nWhile the Administration continues to cancel Americans\u2019 student debt through\nimproving existing forgiveness programs and through the SAVE Plan, the Biden-\nHarris Administration is also pursuing new plans that, if implemented, would\ncancel student debt for tens of millions more. Earlier this week, the\nPresident announced his Administration\u2019s alternative path to debt cancellation\nin the wake of last year\u2019s Supreme Court decision.
