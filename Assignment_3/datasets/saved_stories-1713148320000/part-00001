A reimagining of the critically acclaimed, under-\nexploited cult classic from 2009, play as one of eight Archfiends embroiled in\na Machiavellian contest for the Throne of Hell.\n\nWhat is the game genre for Solium Infernum?\n\nSolium Infernum is a political turn-based grand strategy game, think Armello\nmeets Crusader Kings, with an emphasis on politics and intrigue... but in\nHell.\n\nWhat is the goal of a Solium Infernum game?\n\nThe goal of Solium Infernum is to outwit, outmaneuvre and outplay your claim\nthe Throne of Hell and become the Underworld's new Dark Majesty. You win by\nconducting diplomatic, sorcerous, malevolent and martial actions against your\nfoes to gather the most prestige, winning the Trial of the Throne.\n\nPlayers can also claim the throne via an Usurper Victory - aka; by force.\n\nFor the more conniving player, there are a number of other, less common ways\nto win the Infernal Throne. Solium Infernum is very much a game of exceptions.\n\nHow can I play Solium Infernum?\n\nSolium Infernum is currently available for purchase on PC.\n\nGo ahead and purchase now on Steam.\n\nIs Solium Infernum multiplayer?\n\nYes! Absolutely. Solium Infernum has both standard online multiplayer and its\ninfamous, asynchronous online multiplayer. Both versions of online multiplayer\nsupport 2-6 players.\n\nWhat is this Asynchronous Online multiplayer I keep hearing about?\n\nAsynchronous online multiplayer is a form of multiplayer where players do not\nhave to be playing (or even online) at the same time. Meaning, a game of\nSolium Infernum can be played over the course of multiple days (or weeks!)\nwith players completing 1+ turns a day or more. Turn timers can be up to a\nweek long!\n\nIf you want to get an idea just how incredible the original Solium Infernum's\nasynchronous multiplayer was, you can read all about it in the legendary\n'Gameboys from Hell' After Action Report from RockPaperShotgun in 2009.\n\nWill there be any differences in game play between real-time and asynchronous\nmultiplayer?\n\nIn regards to the user-experience, there will most certainly be some\ndifferences. You can imagine standard videogame fare like turn timers for\nreal-time games to keep them moving along, etc.\n\nHowever, in regards to the actual gameplay? No. None at all.\n\nDoes Solium Infernum have single-player?\n\nYes. Not only can you play standard Solium Infernum skirmishes against AI\nplayers, but we have also added eight single-player Scenarios, one for each\nArchfiend!\n\nHow long does a game of Solium Infernum take?\n\nDepending on which options for game length, map size and number of players you\nhave selected, a game of Solium Infernum can take anywhere from 2-6 hours of\nplay.\n\nAsynchronous mutliplayer sessions can last anywhere from a number of days to\nweeks, months, even over a year, but they are played in bursts of 5-30min\nwhenever and wherever players can find the time.\n\nWill Solium Infernum be releasing on consoles?\n\nUnfortunately not. Solium Infernum is releasing on PC (Windows) only.\n\nWill Solium Infernum work on my Steam Deck?\n\nYes! Solium Infernum will absolutely run on your Steam Deck. Though we are not\n'Verified' on Steam Deck at launch, many players have reported that Solium\nInfernum can be played on Steam Deck. Though, admittedly, we recommend playing\nwith a mouse (and reading glasses).\n\nWill there be post launch support and content?\n\nWould would love to add both DLC and free updates beyond launch. It will all\ndepend on how the game performs financially.\n\nWho is this game for?\n\nStrategy fans, board game lovers, self-confessed intellects and your most\nMachiavellian friends. If watching the smile leave your friends' faces as you\nstab them in the back (in a game of course) then this is the game for you!\n\nSolium Infernum sounds pretty hardcore. I've not played many strategy games,\nwill I be able to pick it up?\n\nAt League of Geeks, our focus as a studio is to make strategy games that are\naccessible, yet deep, have a unique aesthetic signature, and have a whole\ntonne of heart (even if that's a heart of darkness).\n\nSo yes, give it a shot! Whilst there is a lot to Solium Infernum, we design\nall our games to be broadly accessible so that anyone who plays videogames can\ndive straight in and with a little bit of determination, can get to the good\nstuff.\n\nWe'll make a strategy mastermind of you yet. ;)\n\nDoes the game have a tutorial or in-game encyclopedia?\n\nBoth! Solium Infernum comes complete with a bespoke tutorial, as well as\nsingleplayer scenarios to get you familiar with the game's more advanced\nmechanics before diving into multiplayer. And once you're in there, the in-\ngame Enyclopedia Infernum will have everything you need to navigate the\nUnderworld.\n\nIs this related in any way to the 'Solium Infernum' developed by Vic Davis\n(Cryptic Comet) in 2009?\n\nIt is! As mentioned on the game's Steam page, our Solium Infernum \"is a re-\nimagining and modernisation of Vic Davis\u2019 critically acclaimed cult-classic of\nthe same name.\".\n\nHow faithful to the original will this be?\n\nVery! We love the original. That's why we're here. Our aim for the reboot of\nthis strategy classic has always been to reimagine and modernise Solium\nInfernum for contemporary audiences, whilst keeping all the ingenius design\nand dark glory of the original.\n\nWe've worked hard to take the original and remove points of friction, lift the\nproduction values, improve the AI, and expand upon the content in the game\n(adding single-player scenarios and all new Archfiends for example).\n\nAs fans of the original ourselves, we're confident that If you enjoyed the\noriginal, this is very likely to be the reboot you've been waiting for.\n\nAre there animated cards like in Armello?\n\nSimilar to Armello's beautiful, lively card art, almost all in-game\nillustrations animate when interacted with.\n\nWill there be mod/editor support?\n\nThere are currently no plans for mod or any kind of editor support.\n\nAny other questions?\n\nFeel free to post questions below. We'll update the FAQ, clarifying answers\nand folding in new questions as they come up.\n\nNote: We'll be keeping the thread tidy by deleting comments once they've been\nintegrated into the FAQ.\n\nLast edited by [LoG] Trent Kusters; 24 Feb @ 1:25am\n\n< >\n\nShowing 1-0 of 0 comments\n\n< >\n\nShowing 1-0 of 0 comments\n\nSolium Infernum > Non-Owner Discussions > Topic Details\n\n## Report this post\n\nREASON\n\nNote: This is ONLY to be used to report spam, advertising, and problematic\n(harassment, fighting, or rude) posts.\n\n\u00a9 Valve Corporation.
