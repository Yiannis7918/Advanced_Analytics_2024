While such data is important for understanding,\npredicting, and optimizing the performance of software running on these\nmicroarchitectures, most of it is not documented in the official processor\nmanuals.\n\nLearn more\n\n## XML File\n\nA machine-readable XML file with latency, throughput, and port usage data.\nContains also information on the operands of each instruction.\n\nClick here\n\n## Table\n\nAn interactive HTML table that makes it easy to compare different\nmicroarchitectures. Contains links to web pages with details for each entry.\n\nClick here\n\n## Paper\n\nFor more information, please check out our paper \"uops.info Characterizing\nLatency, Throughput, and Port Usage of Instructions on Intel\nMicroarchitectures\"\n\nClick here\n\nIf you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, please contact Andreas\nAbel at abel@cs.uni-saarland.de.\n\n\u00a9 Real-Time and Embedded Systems Lab | Imprint | Data protection | Design by TEMPLATED.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
