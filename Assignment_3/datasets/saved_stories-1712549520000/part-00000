Installation instructions are here.\n\nIn October 2020, we changed from the MIT to the AGPL license to prevent\ncorporations from exploiting our code without giving back.\n\nAs mentioned at the time, we wanted a \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d license. Here\u2019s the\nquote of what we wrote more than three years ago on what we were trying to\naccomplish with the license change:\n\n>   * We want to prevent corporations from taking our code and using it as\n> part of their closed-source proprietary products\n>   * We want to prevent corporations from offering Plausible as a service\n> without contributing to the open source project\n>   * We want to prevent corporations from confusing people and making them\n> think that the service they sell is in any shape or form approved by the\n> original team\n>\n\n>\n> And we don\u2019t want this to in any way impact the actual use case Plausible is\n> built for. A completely open source and self-hostable web analytics tool\n> that helps people de-Googlify their sites and respect the privacy of their\n> visitors.\n\nThat license change has helped us build a sustainable open source project with\n8 core team members and several paid external contributors at the time of\nwriting. We don\u2019t have any investors, so all this is solely funded by the fees\nour 12,000+ subscribers pay us.\n\nAs we\u2019ve progressed in our journey, we\u2019ve become aware that despite its\nadvantages, the AGPL license doesn\u2019t go far enough to protect us against all\nthe threats we face. To better protect our project in the future, we\u2019re\nchanging some things about our self-hosted release. These changes don\u2019t affect\nanyone subscribing to the Plausible Analytics managed hosting in the cloud.\nEverything stays the same there.\n\nIf you have a blog, a personal site or a business site, we want you to be able\nto self-host our code on your servers without needing to pay us any fees if\nthat\u2019s your preference. Nothing changes about this either. Our self-hosted\ncode continues being AGPL-licensed, \u201cfree as in beer\u201d and is the same code\nrunning in the production on our Plausible Analytics managed hosting in the\ncloud.\n\nHere\u2019s more on what\u2019s being changed and why.\n\n  1. Threats we\u2019re facing\n  2. Sticking to the AGPL license\n  3. Changes we\u2019re making to our self-hosted release\n\n    1. Our self-hosted release will be called Plausible Community Edition\n    2. A stronger moat for our official managed hosting\n    3. Features to be offered on top of Plausible CE\n  4. Ensuring the continuous sustainability\n\n## Threats we\u2019re facing\n\nWe want to reduce the threat from businesses such as hosting companies and\nother resellers who try to commercialize popular open source projects. We\u2019ve\nseen our self-hosted code being used in a way it was never intended for by\ncorporations that don\u2019t care about us or open source. Our license doesn\u2019t\nprevent these corporations from using the Plausible Analytics name and logo\neither, as these are a part of our self-hosted code.\n\nWe face threats both from single-tenant and multi-tenant hosts and resellers.\nThese entities compete against us using our work and brand without\ncontributing back. For them it\u2019s a business opportunity to commercialize open\nsource software. They are even damaging our brand. We\u2019ve had cases of these\nentities:\n\n  * Confusing people and making them think that we approve of the service they run\n  * Reselling our self-hosted code while running Google Analytics and other surveillance capitalism scripts on their site\n  * Using Google and Amazon-owned servers despite promising that they\u2019re running on EU-owned infrastructure\n  * Having a bad user experience with under provisioned servers, slow loading time, frequent downtime and no support\n  * Running paid advertising on Google and paying referral fees for people to promote them. Both marketing tactics that we say no to ourselves\n\nThese use cases were never the intention behind our self-hosted release. We\nwanted to give site owners a way to de-Google their sites even if they didn\u2019t\nwant to or couldn\u2019t use our managed service. Now, we\u2019re facing situations\nwhere companies much larger than us with much bigger resources use our brand\nto compete against us and gain a business advantage.\n\nIt\u2019s telling that these entities rarely decide to build their brand on top of\nour code. They prefer to use the brand we\u2019ve built instead as it gives them a\nbetter and easier starting point. These actions not only threaten our\nsustainability but also mislead people who trust the Plausible Analytics name.\nWe want to ensure that anyone using or considering our services knows\nprecisely what they\u2019re getting, without confusion or misrepresentation.\n\n## Sticking to the AGPL license\n\nWe\u2019re real people who have rent to pay and mouths to feed. We make $300 per\nmonth from donations from our self-hosted users. It would take us more than\nten years of donations to pay one month of salary for our small team. If we\ncannot capture the economic value of our work, the project will become\nunsustainable and die.\n\nWe believe this would not only hurt us as people but also all of the users of\nthe product. Our self-hosted users directly benefit from the investments we\ncan put into product development. All this is made possible and solely funded\nby the revenue we get from our managed hosting in the cloud.\n\nWe\u2019ve learned that being open source and transparent has costs. Dealing with\nthese threats is an incredibly taxing and time-consuming distraction for our\nsmall team. It\u2019s something our proprietary competitors never even have to\nthink about.\n\nSeveral popular open source projects have shifted away from traditional models\nin the last few years because of similar threats that we\u2019re facing. They\u2019re\nadopting licenses such as the Business Source License (BSL) or the Server Side\nPublic License (SSPL) as these licenses more directly address the concerns\nabout resellers and hosting companies.\n\nThese licenses are not approved nor recognized by the Open Source Initiative\n(OSI), which is why we\u2019re not interested in switching to them. We want to stay\nopen source to continue providing a transparent and privacy-friendly web\nanalytics tool with a \u201cfree as in beer\u201d self-hosted release.\n\n## Changes we\u2019re making to our self-hosted release\n\nHere\u2019s how we\u2019ll proceed with our self-hosted release. These changes will go\nlive with the next version of our self-hosted release (2.1.0). Release notes\nare here.\n\n### Our self-hosted release will be called Plausible Community Edition\n\nOur self-hosted release will be renamed Plausible Community Edition (or\nPlausible CE). Plausible CE will also have a different logo from the Plausible\nAnalytics managed hosting in the cloud. This is the main change you\u2019ll see if\nyou\u2019re running our self-hosted code on your server.\n\nPlausible CE continues to be AGPL-licensed and \u201cfree as in beer\u201d. It continues\nto be the same code running in the production on our managed hosting. As we\u2019ve\ndone so far, we\u2019ll keep maintaining, improving and adding features to the\nPlausible CE with new releases twice annually.\n\nTo further protect our brand from threats, we\u2019ve registered trademarks for\nPlausible Analytics on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\n### A stronger moat for our official managed hosting\n\nWe\u2019re excluding features we use to manage Plausible Analytics at scale, such\nas the sites API and customer relationship management system, from Plausible\nCE. As a self-hoster, you likely haven\u2019t noticed these features, as they\u2019ve\nbeen undocumented and are primarily helpful when providing web analytics as a\nservice.\n\nWe\u2019re also keeping some of the newly released business and enterprise features\n(funnels and ecommerce revenue metrics at the time of being) exclusive to the\nbusiness plan subscribers on our Plausible Analytics managed hosting.\n\nThe code for all these features is still available to the public so it can be\nreviewed and inspected, but these features will not be a part of Plausible CE\nand they\u2019ll have a different license.\n\nThis change also means that if you want to contribute to our codebase in the\nfuture as an external contributor, you\u2019ll need to sign a Contributor License\nAgreement (CLA).\n\nTo provide a better service and experience to people who pay our bills,\nPlausible CE will continue to not have any premium customer support and is\ncommunity-supported only.\n\nThis open core model is something that GitLab and other open source projects\nhave championed and we believe it\u2019s the best and most open source friendly\napproach for the situation we\u2019re in.\n\n### Features to be offered on top of Plausible CE\n\nThe plan moving forward is to carefully consider which features to keep\nexclusive to our managed cloud hosting. These will predominantly be features\nthat help us run our managed hosting at scale and enterprise features. We aim\nalways to ensure a protective barrier around our cloud offering.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that all business and enterprise features won\u2019t ever make it\nto the Plausible CE. Nothing from Plausible CE will be taken away in the\nfuture and we plan to periodically evaluate business and enterprise features\nto be added to Plausible CE.\n\nFor instance, we\u2019ve already decided to release custom properties (another\nbusiness feature in the cloud) as part of the Plausible CE. We\u2019ll update the\nrelease notes with any new features making their way to Plausible CE in the\nfuture.\n\n## Ensuring the continuous sustainability\n\nThese changes will affect corporations that take our code to compete directly\nagainst us as it will create a more substantial moat and better protection for\nour official managed hosting. It will get more challenging for them to\nmisrepresent their association with us or use our brand and logo misleadingly.\nAnd they won\u2019t be able to offer a fully featured Plausible Analytics product\nwith all the enterprise features included either.\n\nMany indie hackers that contact us about our experience of running an open\nsource startup tell us that their main concern about open sourcing their code\nis the risk that large corporations will resell that code and take advantage\nof their project. It\u2019s a valid concern. We hope that our new approach\nmitigates most potential downsides and still allows the upsides of releasing\nour code free to the world.\n\nWith the change of our self-hosted release name and logo, the registration of\nour trademarks and the exclusive availability of certain enterprise features\nto our managed cloud hosting, we aim to better ensure the sustainability of\nPlausible Analytics in the face of external threats in the future.
