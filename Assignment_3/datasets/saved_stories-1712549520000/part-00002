Called\nthe flight data subsystem (FDS), the computer is responsible for packaging the\nprobe\u2019s science and engineering data before the telemetry modulation unit\n(TMU) and radio transmitter send the data to Earth.\n\nIn early March, the team issued a \u201cpoke\u201d command to prompt the spacecraft to\nsend back a readout of the FDS memory, which includes the computer\u2019s software\ncode as well as variables (values used in the code that can change based on\ncommands or the spacecraft\u2019s status). Using the readout, the team has\nconfirmed that about 3% of the FDS memory has been corrupted, preventing the\ncomputer from carrying out normal operations.\n\nThe team suspects that a single chip responsible for storing part of the\naffected portion of the FDS memory isn\u2019t working. Engineers can\u2019t determine\nwith certainty what caused the issue. Two possibilities are that the chip\ncould have been hit by an energetic particle from space or that it simply may\nhave worn out after 46 years.\n\nAlthough it may take weeks or months, engineers are optimistic they can find a\nway for the FDS to operate normally without the unusable memory hardware,\nwhich would enable Voyager 1 to begin returning science and engineering data\nagain.\n\nLaunched in 1977, the twin Voyager spacecraft flew by Saturn and Jupiter, and\nVoyager 2 flew by Uranus and Neptune. They are both exploring interstellar\nspace, outside the bubble of particles and magnetic fields created by the Sun,\ncalled the heliosphere. Voyager 2 continues to operate normally.\n\nNews Media Contact Calla Cofield Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.\n626-808-2469 calla.e.cofield@jpl.nasa.gov\n\nAuthor Naomi HartonoPosted on April 4, 2024April 4, 2024\n\n## Archives\n\n  * April 2024\n  * March 2024\n\n## Categories\n\n  * Uncategorized\n\n## Recent Posts\n\n  * Engineers Pinpoint Cause of Voyager 1 Issue, Are Working on Solution\n  * NASA Engineers Make Progress Toward Understanding Voyager 1 Issue\n  * Engineers Working to Resolve Issue With Voyager 1 Computer\n  * Introducing the Voyager Mission Blog\n\n## Recent Comments\n\nNo comments to show.\n\nVoyager National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA Official: Brian\nDunbar\n\n  * No Fear Act\n  * FOIA\n  * Privacy\n  * Office of Inspector General\n  * Agency Financial Reports\n  * Contact NASA\n  * Accessibility\n\n", "frontpage": true}
