By all accounts it was\nabout a year. That\u2019s is not much time and it meant that some things were not\nreadily available when it finally shipped.\n\nOne of these things was documentation. Sure, you could get the Developer\u2019s Kit\nfrom Atari itself, but this was a $400 package ($1100 in 2024) that consisted\nof a C compiler and a bunch of poorly written documentation. That was a lot of\nmoney for anyone that was not a professional.\n\nGoto 10: The Newsletter for Atari Enthusiasts is a reader-supported\npublication.

It certainly made learning about the new machine pretty difficult.\n\n> Of course, this was still miles better than what the old Atari did when the\n> 400/800 were introduced, which was nothing.

But progress was slow as alternative C compilers\nwere slow to appear.\n\nHowever in late 1985, things started to change with the release of a variety\nof new books from Abacus Software. Unknown to those in the Atari world, Abacus\nwas a producer of books and software for the Commodore 64.\n\nIn fact, that was a common trend as many Commodore 64 vendors would jump on\nboard with the Atari ST.\n\nThese books were actually written by Data Becker, a German company, and\npublished by Abacus. At first, everyone was excited about these books as they\nlooked rather professional and much, much better than the loose-leaf\ncollection of documentation in the Developer\u2019s Kit.\n\nBut then the reviews started coming in: the books were not great and had lots\nof errors. Still, I think they were somewhat popular because there just was\nnot much else at the time. Even the newer C compilers that started appearing\ndid not often have full ST programming docs, so books like these remained\nnecessary.\n\nAnd the Abacus books did not have any competition until Compute! got into the\ngame with their excellent Technical Reference Guides in 1987.\n\nPersonally I did not have the Abacus books back at the time. I only got my\nfirst ST in 1989, so by then there was much more information available. I also\nstarted with Personal Pascal which had pretty good docs for its custom GEM\nAPI. And by then most C compilers also had pretty thorough documentation.\n\nToday I have three of the Abacus books (with links to scans on the Internet\nArchive):\n\n  * Atari ST Internals (#2)\n\n  * Atari ST GEM Programmer\u2019s Reference (#3)\n\n  * Atari ST Machine Language (#4)\n\nThere were other books as well as the full set goes from 1 through 13.\n\nOf those, I think the only other ones of interest to me are Graphics & Sound\n(#7), 3D Graphics (#12) and Disk Drives: inside and Out (#13).\n\nI\u2019ve read through the books I have and they are a bit of a tough read, being\nrather dry. In part 2 of this post I will go over these three books I have in\nmore detail.

They\u2018d print books about almost every\naspect, I do have one about the ST that came out before the machine was\navailable at retail and basically just described the machine and showed a\ncouple of screenshots, but had no programming info whatsoever. One of their\n8-bit books (Atari 800XL PEEKS and POKES or so contained lots of undocumented\naddresses that the US Atari gurus had warned not to use years before.Expand\nfull commentLike (2)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nMichael MalakApr 5Liked by Paul LefebvreSome of the Abacus books can be\ndownloaded from https://archive.org/details/ataristmanualsBack in the day, I\nhad two of the early Abacus books. Those together with the Megamax C manual\ngot me to where I was developing, in C, final projects for grad school. Then\nafter graduation, I had a unique set of constraints at my job: on PCs, be able\nto process interrupts with zero latency while also providing a GUI. Because\nWindows was non-deterministic with interrupts, I sat down with Microsoft C 6.0\nfor DOS and wrote a GUI from scratch -- mimicking somewhat the GEM API that I\nhad grown so familiar with. Here is what it looked like:\nhttps://www.semitracks.com/reference-material/failure-and-yield-\nanalysis/failure-analysis-package-level/figures/acoustic-microscopy-\nfigure-9.gifExpand full commentLike (2)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n1 more comment...\n\nGoto 10 Dedication: My Dad\n\nDementia sucks\n\nFeb 16 \u2022\n\nPaul Lefebvre\n\n19\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Goto 10 Dedication: My Dad\n\nwww.goto10retro.com\n\n6\n\nAtari Falcon030\n\nImpressive, but too late to the party\n\nMar 15 \u2022\n\nPaul Lefebvre\n\n6\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Atari Falcon030\n\nwww.goto10retro.com\n\n9\n\nMy First BASIC Programs\n\nOur family got our first computer in 1983 (an Atari 400), but unlike most\ncomputers of the time the Atari computers did not come with BASIC built-in.\nSo...\n\nAug 19, 2022 \u2022\n\nPaul Lefebvre\n\n15\n\nShare this post\n\n#### My First BASIC Programs\n\nwww.goto10retro.com\n\n8\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Paul Lefebvre\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great writing\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
