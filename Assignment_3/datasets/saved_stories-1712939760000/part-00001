You can read it at the\nGuardian\u2019s website, but the bit I\u2019d like to focus on is this:\n\n> The national minimum wage in the UK is \u00a311.44. A small grocery store like\n> the Amazon Fresh shops might have half a dozen staff. Assuming all of them\n> were on full wage (unlikely) and all of them were on the lowest wage (ie not\n> managers), the average individual salary would be about \u00a320k and the annual\n> wage bill would be about \u00a3130k. When this work is outsourced via video\n> cameras, it is passed to data labellers. Amazon\u2019s remote data labellers\n> might be paid one or two pounds an hour, if they are lucky. If you can\n> replace half a dozen UK staff with half a dozen data labellers in India,\n> Kenya or the Philippines, then the difference in the annual staff bill alone\n> could be almost \u00a3100,000 a year.\n>\n> Jeff Bezos is the second-wealthiest person in the world, worth about $205bn\n> (\u00a3163bn). That money doesn\u2019t come out of nowhere. It doesn\u2019t drop out of a\n> pier-end slot machine called, \u201cI learned to code at Princeton and that\u2019s why\n> I\u2019m better than you\u201d. It is the result of deliberately hiding actual work \u2013\n> designing, making, sorting, packing, cooking, farming, delivering \u2013 behind\n> little icons on your smartphone screen, in order to devalue it. It is the\n> systematic use of the fake robot trick to lower the value of labour, until\n> people are reportedly sleeping in tents at the factory gates, then banking\n> the difference.\n>\n> The size of Bezos\u2019s rocket is very precisely determined by the difference in\n> costs between paying a worker in Britain and a worker in India \u2013 including\n> all the historically determined racist and colonialist inequality that\n> calculation involves. But make no mistake \u2013 Bezos and his ilk will pay a\n> robot even less, as soon as that\u2019s possible. The only lesson of Amazon Fresh\n> is that we are not \u2013 quite \u2013 there yet.\n\nThe thing that I\u2019m doing here \u2013 looking at the precise cost saving of\noutsourcing labour through technology, and pointing out that this is actually\na form of wage theft which accumulates to the capital of the company doing it\n\u2013 was directly inspired by one of the most extraordinary books I\u2019ve read in\nsome time.\n\nThat book is Sven Lindqvist\u2019s Dig Where You Stand. I expect I\u2019ll be writing a\nlot about it in my next book, but \u2013 not least because I\u2019m really interested in\ndiscussing it with anyone else who\u2019s read it \u2013 some notes...\n\nI\u2019ve been a huge admirer of Lindqvist for some time. Saharan Journey,\nExterminate All the Brutes (which you might know from its HBO series\nadaptation by Raoul Peck, which I also highly recommend), and A History of\nBombing are all unique texts, blending visceral, passionate reportage with\nhigh literary technique. I quote on a regular basis his line from\nExterminate... which for me encapsulates the problem of knowledge and action\nin an era of over-whelming information: \u201cYou already know enough. So do I. It\nis not knowledge we lack. What is missing is the courage to understand what we\nknow and to draw conclusions.\u201d\n\nDig Where You Stand was published in Swedish in 1978, and started a whole\nmovement in Scandinavia and elsewhere. I\u2019ve been telling people that it\u2019s\nsimultaneously the most boring and the most fascinating book I\u2019ve ever read.\nThe first part is because it\u2019s largely a book about the Swedish concrete\nindustry: its history, its structures, its employees and management, its role\nin society. But it is very much more than that. It\u2019s a practical handbook for\nworkers in any industry to excavate and relate the history of their own\nlabour, and thus to better frame their present working conditions and\nindustrial relations. And it\u2019s much more than that too: by meticulously\nresearching the history of worker\u2019s lives, even as they are scarcely recorded\nin the official archives, Lindqvist shows how power, over time, appropriates\nthe value of labour, and makes this \u2013 yes \u2013 concrete.\n\nOne chapter, for example, details the official holiday allowances of workers\nin a factory in the 1920s, 30s, and 40s, as well as the unpaid seasonal\nlayoffs which preceded this period. Then he shares excerpts from the diaries\nof the factory\u2019s owner: their yacht trips, trips abroad, long weekends at\ntheir country house. Each moment of the owner\u2019s leisure revealed as time\nstolen, directly, from the lives of his employees, who can neither afford, not\nhave time for, such pleasures. Another chapter performs a similar analysis on\nworker\u2019s housing, another on healthcare, and so on. A chapter on asbestos is\nparticularly devastating: Lindqvist shows how deliberate cost-saving measures\nby management in the first half of the twentieth century manifest as both\ncancers in the lungs of workers later in life, and as actual capital in the\naccounts of the company.\n\n\u201cThus history lives on in living people\u2019s bodies. It lurks there and finally\nit kills. When the dead body is opened up, history can be found in the shape\nof silvery fibres \u2013 the last remnants of the air people breathed in the\nfactories and workers\u2019 homes of the 1910s and 20s.\u201d [p. 115]\n\n\u201cFor each year that Sk\u00e5nska Cement managed to avoid installing an\nelectrostatic filter, the company could save some money at the expense of the\nworkers and and the local population. This money has not disappeared. It is\nstill there and today forms part of the capital of Industri AB Euroc.\u201d [p.\n122]\n\nLindqvist didn\u2019t invent dialectical materialism. What he does in Dig... is\ncritically twofold: he puts it to work, and he shows you how to do it. The\nbook is a handbook, and includes boxed texts in every chapter showing you how\nto go and find this information yourself, where to find it \u2013 and how to ask\nquestions of it. The result is more than information; it is agency.\n\nFinally, Lindqvist points to a couple of examples of where workers have become\ninvolved in their work politically and culturally. He insists on the value of\nworkers knowledge (in a chapter which compares the official Swedish dictionary\nwith worker\u2019s terms for their own tools, he writes: \u201cyou have knowledge that\nscience has not\u201d [p. 207]). And he writes particularly movingly of the work of\nretired engineers Tony Cundick, Ivan Fear, and Ron Plaster, who saved and\nrestored the five huge steam engines at the Kew Bridge Pumping station:\n\n> \u201cTo me the steam engine is a time machine,\u201d says Ron Plaster. \u201cWhen I work\n> on one of them, I feel it\u2019s a way to enter history, knock off the rust, take\n> it to pieces, clean it, polish it, oil it and start again. You can sense the\n> odor of history, you hear it hissing and puffing when the steam is admitted.\n> You can feel history tremble under the pressure, see it start slowly and\n> begin to move, you see how history works \u2014 that\u2019s what\u2019s so fantastic.\u201d [p.\n> 240]\n\n\u201cTo reconstruct an old text \u2014 that\u2019s research\u201d writes Lindqvist. \u201d To restore\nold murals in a church \u2014 that\u2019s culture. But to get one of the largest and\noldest steam engines of the world to move again, after having been in the\nscrap-yard for thirty years \u2014 what is that?\u201d [p. 241]\n\nOne of the most interesting things about Lindqvist\u2019s book is its legacy. In\nScandinavia, it gave shape (and a name) to the emerging Dig Where You Stand\nmovement, which saw tens of thousands of ordinary people (who Lindqvist termed\n\u201cbarefoot researchers\u201d) join study groups and excavate their own histories and\nsocial conditions. In Germany, it helped inspire the widespread History\nMovement which advocated active popular engagement with the country\u2019s recent\npast. Among many other things, the History Movement led to the literal digging\nup, by amateur archaeologists, of the rubble-strewn former Gestapo\nheadquarters in Berlin: an action which in turn led to the preservation of the\nsite, which is now the Topography of Terror museum.\n\nAlthough it wasn\u2019t published in English until 2023, unofficial translations\ncirculated in Britain from the 1970s, including as part of the curriculum of\nthe History Workshop, Raphael Samuel\u2019s seminars at Ruskin College which also\nled to a broad history-from-below movement. I\u2019m currently reading Workshop of\nthe World, Verso\u2019s recent edition of Samuel\u2019s essays, which is leading me to\nall sorts of interesting places, like the Pleb\u2019s League, a worker\u2019s self-\neducation collective founded in the mining communities of South Wales. In the\n1920s the League collectively published a series of textbooks on subjects such\nas psychology, finance, and imperialism. I\u2019m looking forward to going to the\nMarx Memorial Library to read them.\n\nComments are closed.
