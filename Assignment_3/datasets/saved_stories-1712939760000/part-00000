It is built using the Fyne toolkit and is designed to be easy to use\nas well as easy to develop. We use the Go language and welcome any\ncontributions or feedback for the project.\n\n## Dependencies\n\n### Compiling\n\nCompiling requires the same dependencies as Fyne. See the Getting Started\ndocumentation for installation steps.\n\n### Running\n\nFor a full desktop experience you will also need the following external tools\ninstalled:\n\n  * arandr for modifying display settings\n  * xbacklight or brightnessctl for laptop brightness\n  * connman-gtk is currently used for configuring Wi-Fi network settings\n  * compton for compositor support\n\nThe desktop does work without the runtime dependencies but the experience will\nbe degraded.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nUsing standard Go tools you can install FyneDesk using:\n\n    \n    \n    go get fyshos.com/fynedesk/cmd/fynedesk\n\nThis will add fynedesk to your $GOPATH (usually ~/go/bin). You can now run the\napp in \"preview\" mode like any other Fyne app. Doing so is not running a\nwindow manager, to do so requires another few steps:\n\n### Setting up as a desktop environment\n\nTo use this as your main desktop you can run the following commands to set up\nfynedesk as a selectable desktop option in your login manager (such as LightDM\nfor example):\n\n    \n    \n    git clone https://github.com/fyshos/fynedesk cd fynedesk make sudo make install\n\nYou can now log out and see that it is in your desktop selection list at\nlogin.\n\n### Debugging a window manager\n\nYou can also run the window manager components in an embedded X window for\ntesting. You will need the Xephyr tool installed for your platform (often\ninstalled as part of Xorg). Once it is present you can use the following\ncommand from the same directory as above:\n\n    \n    \n    make embed\n\nIt should look like this:\n\nIf you run the command when there is a window manager running, or on an\noperating system that does not support window managers (Windows or macOS) then\nthe app will start in UI test mode. When loaded in this way you can run all of\nthe features except the controlling of windows - they will load on your main\ndesktop.\n\n## Runner\n\nA desktop needs to be rock solid, and whilst we are working hard to get there,\nany alpha or beta software can run into unexpected issues. For that reason, we\nhave included a fynedesk_runner utility that can help manage unexpected\nevents. If you start the desktop using the runner, then if a crash occurs, it\nwill normally recover where it left off with no loss of data in your\napplications.\n\nUsing standard Go tools you can install the runner using:\n\n    \n    \n    go get fyshos.com/fynedesk/cmd/fynedesk_runner\n\nFrom then on execute that instead of the fynedesk command for a more resilient\ndesktop when testing out pre-release builds.\n\n## Design\n\nDesign concepts, and the abstract wallpapers have been contributed by Jost\nGrant.\n\n## Shipping FyneDesk\n\nIf you are installing FyneDesk by default on a distribution, or making it\navailable as a standard option, you should consider the following points. You\ndo not need to ship the library or any dependencies, but it is recommended to\nadd the following apps as well:\n\napp| go get| description  \n---|---|---  \nfin| github.com/fyshos/fin| A display manager app that matches the look and\nfeel of FyneDesk  \n  \nPlease do let us know if you package FyneDesk for your system, so we can\ninclude a link from here :).\n\n## About\n\nA full desktop environment for Linux/Unix using Fyne\n\nfyne.io/fynedesk/\n\n### Topics\n\ngo golang gui desktop desktop-environment hacktoberfest\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\n### License\n\nView license\n\nActivity\n\nCustom properties\n\n### Stars\n\n705 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n24 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n37 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases 7\n\nVirtual desktops and a new screen layout highlight 0.4 release Latest\n\nMar 2, 2024\n\n\\+ 6 releases\n\n## Sponsor this project\n\n  * andydotxyz Andy Williams\n  * okratitan Stephen M Houston\n\n  * https://fossfi.sh/support-fyneio\n\nLearn more about GitHub Sponsors\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Contributors 8\n\n## Languages\n\n  * Go 99.8%\n  * Makefile 0.2%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
