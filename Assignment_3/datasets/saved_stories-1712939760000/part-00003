newsletter\nwith Robert Frank, a weekly guide to the high-net-worth investor and consumer.\nSign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox.\n\nWealthy U.S. families are increasingly applying for second citizenships and\nnational residences as a way to hedge their financial risk, according to a\nleading law firm.\n\nThe wealthy are building these \u201cpassport portfolios\u201d \u2014 collections of second,\nand even third or fourth, citizenships \u2014 in case they need to flee their home\ncountry. Henley & Partners, a law firm that specializes in high-net-worth\ncitizenships, said Americans now outnumber every other nationality when it\ncomes to securing alternative residences or added citizenships.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. is still a great country, it\u2019s still an amazing passport,\u201d said\nDominic Volek, group head of private clients at Henley & Partners. \u201cBut if I\u2019m\nwealthy, I would like to hedge against levels of volatility and uncertainty.\nThe idea of diversification is well understood by wealthy individuals around\nwhat they invest. It makes no sense to have one country of citizenship and\nresidence when I have the ability to actually diversify that aspect of my life\nas well.\u201d\n\nRecent high-profile examples of second citizenships include billionaire tech\ninvestor Peter Thiel, who added a citizenship in New Zealand, and former\nGoogle CEO Eric Schmidt, who applied for citizenship in Cyprus.\n\nThomas Kokta | Photographer\u2019s Choice Rf | Getty Images\n\nOf course, the wealthy aren\u2019t packing up en masse and ditching their American\ncitizenship. While a relatively small number of Americans do renounce their\ncitizenship every year to declare a new home country, mainly due to tax-filing\nrequirements, the so-called \u201cexit tax\u201d required to renounce citizenship makes\nit financially prohibitive for most except the ultra-wealthy to simply\nrenounce and declare a new citizenship.\n\nInstead, many wealthy Americans are shopping around for an added visa or\ncitizenship program to supplement their U.S. passport.\n\nAccording to Henley, the top destinations for supplemental passports among\nAmericans are Portugal, Malta, Greece and Italy. Portugal\u2019s \u201cGolden Visa\u201d\nprogram is especially popular since it provides a path to residency and\ncitizenship \u2014 with visa-free travel in Europe \u2014 in exchange for an investment\nof 500,000 euros (roughly $541,000) in a fund or private equity. Malta offers\na Golden Visa for 300,000 euros invested in real estate, which Volek said has\nbecome \u201cespecially popular with Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith Malta you become a European citizen, with complete settlement rights\nacross Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you can live in Germany, your kids can go and\nstudy in France and you have the right to live, work and study throughout\nEurope.\u201d\n\nThere are three main reasons for the rise of American passport portfolios, or\n\u201cdomicile diversification.\u201d An alternative passport makes travel easier for\nAmericans venturing to parts of the world that are less friendly to the U.S.\n\n\u201cFor American, British, and Israeli citizens suddenly unsure of their welcome\nabroad, supplementary passports provide vital flexibility,\u201d according to a\nHenley report. \u201cWith rising global instability, holding citizenship in another\ncountry, particularly one that is considered more neutral or politically\nbenign, now provides a valuable back-up or alternative option.\u201d\n\nAnother reason is business travel, which can be safer and less conspicuous\nwith a non-U.S. passport in many countries. U.S. business leaders could be\ntargets for \u201cresentment, hostage-taking, or random terrorism in the chaos of\ncollapsed states or high-risk countries they need to travel to for business\npurposes,\u201d according to the report, which says interested parties range from\nhedge-fund managers who meet with global clients to mining company executives\nwho visit operations sites.\n\nUsing a secondary passport can also help cross-border financial transfers or\ndeals within the new country.\n\nFinally, some wealthy Americans simply want a back-up residency for possible\nretirement, to be closer to their families who live abroad or for lifestyle\nreasons in the new age of remote work. For others, U.S. politics is the\ndriver.\n\n\u201cWe all live in uncertain times, not just in the U.S., but in all nations\nglobally,\u201d Volek said. \u201cWho knows what\u2019s going to happen next. It\u2019s really\nabout having not only a Plan B but Plan C and D in place as well.\u201d\n\nGlobally, millionaire migration is expected to hit a new high in 2024, as\nwars, government crackdowns on wealth, and political uncertainty drive more\nwealthy residents to other countries. An estimated 128,000 millionaires are\nforecast to move to a new country this year, up from 120,000 in 2023 and up\nfrom 51,000 in 2013, according to Henley.\n\nThe U.S. remains a top destination for global millionaires leaving other\ncountries, with a net inflow of 2,200 millionaires in 2023 and a projected\ninflow of 3,500 in 2024, according to Henley.\n\nChina remains the biggest source of millionaire out-migration, losing a net\n13,500 millionaires last year.\n\n\u201cThe wealth-creation opportunities in the U.S. are second to none globally,\u201d\nVolek said.\n\nSign up to receive future editions of CNBC\u2019s Inside Wealth newsletter with\nRobert Frank.\n\nTV\n\nSquawk BoxWATCH LIVEWATCH IN THE APP\n\nUP NEXT | Squawk on the Street 09:00 am ETListen\n\n  * Subscribe to CNBC PRO\n  * Subscribe to Investing Club\n  * Licensing & Reprints\n  * CNBC Councils\n  * Supply Chain Values\n  * CNBC on Peacock\n  * Join the CNBC Panel\n  * Digital Products\n  * News Releases\n  * Closed Captioning\n  * Corrections\n  * About CNBC\n  * Internships\n  * Site Map\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Careers\n  * Help\n  * Contact\n\n  * #### News Tips\n\nGot a confidential news tip?
