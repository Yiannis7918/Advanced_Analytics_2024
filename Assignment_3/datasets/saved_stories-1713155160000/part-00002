The terms seem to be\ninterchangeable, depending on your location. There's a whole range of regional\nterms, too, such as \"Cassies\" or \"Nidgers\" in Scotland, and \"Belgian Block\" in\nsome strange places in southern England. The terms refer to blocks of natural\nstone, hewn from a quarry, in a range of sizes and rock types, and \"cobbles\"\nor cobblestones is also the name given to large, rounded beach pebbles\n200-400mm in size, which are sometimes called 'Duckstones'. These rounded '\ncobbles ' are discussed on a separate page. The general public tend to refer\nto the gritstone 'Hovis Loaf' type as Cobbles, although the correct term is\n'Setts' - these range from 100x100mm to 200x250mm in size, and have an average\ndepth of 150-200mm.\n\nCobbles, setts, kerb and flag identification\n\nTo be technically precise (ie: according to BS EN 1342:2001), a sett is a\ndressed block of stone having plan dimensions that are 50-300mm in length, and\na thickness of at least 50mm. The length and/or width should not usually be\ngreater than twice the thickness. However, some decorative setts for garden\nuse may be only 25mm or so thick and 100x100mm or even larger, in plan.\n\nA cube is a type of sett, one which has all three dimensions roughly equal.\n\nCubes tend to be used for more decorative work, particularly fans and bogens,\nwhich are considered later on this page. While there are setts and cubed with\nperfectly accurate sawn faces, most new cubes are split or cropped and there\nis an urban myth that, somewhere, there exists a cropped ube that has all six\nsides exactly orthogonal, the 'perfect cube'. In over 50 years working with\ncubes, I've never seen one yet!\n\nCubes: length \u2248 width \u2248 thickness\n\nSetts at Castlefields, Manchester\n\nWhether they are cobbles, cubes, cassies or setts, they are excellent paving\nproducts and will last for many, many years; in fact, some of the stones\ncurrently covering the streets of Britain and Ireland have seen over 200 years\nof continual use.\n\nTheir pedigree as a paving unit goes back to the Romans, 2000 years ago, and\nbeyond, and they are characteristic of most of the so-called 'historic' towns\nand cities of these islands. They are fast becoming an essential ingredient in\nthe nostalgia business, as the fashionable designers and developers fondly\nremember their long-lost days of childhood, sitting on a kerb-stone, twirling\nsun-softened pitch onto lolly sticks in the streets of post-war Britain.\n\nCubes in Chester\n\nCobbles in Durham\n\n## Uses and applications\n\nNew Tumbled Setts laid to a driveway\n\nNowadays, new setts are produced to regular dimensions in a wide variety of\nfinishes, and are often laid in the same manner as modern concrete block\npaving . The reclaimed stones can be difficult to lay, mostly because of their\ninherent randomness, but whether new or reclaimed, when they have been laid\ncorrectly, they are a beautiful sight, and make superb paths, patios and\ndriveways, as well as visually stunning areas of civic paving.\n\nAs with many other small element paving units, they offer superb possibilities\nfor design. Their natural colouring, which will not fade as do some concrete\ndyes, and the range of textured finishes bring an extra dimension to paving\ndesign, whether it be the re-creation of traditional cobbled streets or an\nunique and original design for a public area.\n\nSetts are popular for the creation of impressive large-scale patterns in civic\npaving schemes, such as the popular European Fan Pattern and these magnificent\nguilloche swirls outside St. Georges' Hall on Lime Street, in Liverpool.\n\nA centre-stone cut from a yorkstone flag is surrounded by 10 courses of\ngranite cubes, then 2 soldier courses of grey-black basalt setts edge a\nfigure-of-eight pattern laid in blue-black long setts. The pattern is bounded\nby a double channel course of the dark blue-black long setts, and infill\npaving is done in the lighter-coloured granite cubes. Overall, the pattern is\napproximately 6 metres in width. What other paving material could give such a\nstunning look?\n\nGuilloche setts in Liverpool\n\n## Types\n\nThere are three main types of rock in the world and they are all used for the\nproduction of setts; sedimentary, metamorphic and igneous. Sedimentary rocks,\nsuch as sandstone or siltstone, are relatively easier to cut and shape.\nMetamorphic rock, such as Gneiss, Quartzite or Marble, may retain some of the\ncleavage planes of its sedimentary ancestor, which is not always a desirable\ntrait, and so this type is rarely used. Igneous setts, such as basalts and\ngranites, are usually much harder and have few, if any, cleavage planes.\n\nSedimentary setts are still quarried from the Pennine gritstones of Northern\nEngland, although more and more hand-hewn setts are being imported from\nforeign climes, particularly southern Asia, where labour costs are much lower.\nMany of the UK-produced sedimentary setts are sawn from quarried rock, and may\nbe further processed. This has enabled the development of modular sett paving,\nwhich is discussed below.\n\nHand-hewn setts and cubes\n\nIgneous rock types are particularly popular for cubes, although setts are\noften hewn from granites, basalts, diorites and gabbros. Many of the reclaimed\nigneous setts and cubes are of British or Irish origin, notably the granites\nof North Wales, Cumbria, Cornwall, Wicklow and Scotland, but more and more of\nthe new materials are imported from other countries.\n\nIgneous rock tends to be denser than sedimentary rock, and its crystalline\nnature of makes it much harder to cut with hand tools than most of the\nsedimentary types. It will rapidly abrade standard blades on power saws, and\nso, if it must be cut with a saw, a diamond blade is strongly recommended.\nHowever, on reclaimed materials the dead straight lines created by power\nsawing looks awry with the natural finish of these units, so we often ' fettle\n' a sawn edge (ie, nobble with a hammer) to give it a more natural, hewn\nappearance.\n\n## Sizes and Tolerances:\n\nIt can seem that there are almost no limits on the sizes of setts and cubes,\nbut as mentioned previously the relevant standard BS EN 1342:2001 gives some\nguidance, in that setts should not be more than 300mm (ish) in length or\nwidth, and neither of the plan dimensions (length and width) should be more\nthan twice the thickness, which suggests a maximum thickness of 150mm.\n\nObviously, there are exceptions. Some reclaimed materials would not meet these\nprecise sizing requirements, and, occasionally, local tradition will result in\nthe use of setts that are larger than the maximum stated dimensions - some\nsetts being laid in Scotland are 200mm thick, for example.\n\nSetts are hewn natural stone and so there is almost inevitably some\n'inaccuracy' in the planned dimensions. These inaccuracies are regulated by\nhaving a permitted tolerance, a specified maximum variation in size, and\nbecause the different finishes available affect the dimensional accuracy, the\n'rougher' finished such as cropped/hewn are given more leeway than that for,\nsay, a sawn or textured finish. Although there are 'complications' which are\nsketchily outlined in the standard, generally speaking cropped/hewn setts and\ncubes are allowed a tolerance of \u00b115mm, while sawn/textured setts and cubes\nare only allowed \u00b1 5mm.\n\nThis tolerance leads to a somewhat informal method of material specification\nfor cubes. Given the rather generous tolerances, cubes are often described by\na pair of values which indicate the minimum and maximum sizes, in centimetres.\n\nSo, the most popular sized cube, which has ideal sizes of 10x10x10 cm, is\nassumed to have a plusmn;1cm tolerance and is therefore described as a 9-11\ncube, that is, cubes with sides that will be between 9cm and 11cm.\n\nThis 9-11 cube has a 'length' of 10.5cm....\n\n...and a 'width' of 9cm - so, it's a 9-11\n\nWhen ordering new cubes, it's usual to specify this dual-number reference,\nwhich is explained in the table opposite.\n\nIt's worth noting that, with cubes, when the laying pattern is to be a fan or\nbogen, there will be a requirement for some larger/smaller rectangular cubes\nand some trapezoidal cubes to complete the patterns, and this is normally\nstated in the specification so that the supplier can include up to 10% off\nthese 'oddball' cubes.\n\n## Finishes\n\nSome of the popular 'finishes' for sedimentary setts are depicted below.\nReclaimed sedimentary setts, if they have a discernable finish left on their\nupper surface, tend to have the picked and punched finishes more commonly\nassociated with igneous-sourced setts - see below.\n\nRough punched sandstone\n\nLong format riven Caithness Slate\n\nSandstone sawn six sides\n\nTumbled Yorkstone\n\nBack in the days before the bureau-Euro-crats came up with the European\nStandard BS EN 1342, the old British Standard (BS435:1975 Specification for\ndressed natural stone kerbs, channels, quadrants and setts) had three simple\nfinishes:\n\n  * Fine Picked - also known as 'Bush Hammered'; fairly smooth, good non-slip surface\n  * Fair Picked - moderately smooth; less worked than fine picked\n  * Rough Punched - self-explanatory! Roughly hewn with high spots chiselled off\n\n... which was straightforward and easily understood.\n\nNow we have to use...\n\n  * Hewn - unworked, commonly referred to as 'cropped'\n  * Coarse Textured - \u00b1 2mm maximum difference between high points and low spots on surface\n  * Fine Textured - \u00b1 0.5mm maximum difference between high points and low spots on surface\n\n...confusion sometimes arises because bush-hammering, a popular finish for\npedestrian areas, might be coarse or fine textured, as might flame texturing.\n\nThe standard also gives prominence to a texture referred to as \"Dolly Point\"\nwhich seems to be some coarse bush-hammer like finish popular in Italy!\n\nBush hammered basalt\n\nFlame textured granite\n\nHewn or cropped setts....\n\n...can result in an uneven pavement\n\n## Colour\n\nThere is a phenomenal range of colours available, virtually any colour you can\nimagine, but finding it can be quite a task. The problem isn't helped by many\nsuppliers giving delusional names to their offerings. Midnight Glacier\nprobably sounds bloody wonderful to a marketing droid, but doesn't actually\ntell me what colour the damned stone is.\n\nEven when these aspirational names are rejected, one person's mid-grey is\nanother's dark grey, so colour is always best judged from actual samples.\n\nIf you are looking for a particular colour to use on your project, contact the\nsuppliers listed on the links page and ask for details of their colour range -\nnot all suppliers will stock all colours.\n\nDark grey, silver grey, red and yellow granites\n\nBuff, tan, brown and grey sandstones\n\n## Coverage\n\nCoverage rates are quite variable, given the random nature of the stone used\nfor setts and cubes, but for guidance only....\n\nType of Stone| Dimensions(L x W x D)| m2 perTonne| Single edging (Lin m)|\nApprox nr per T  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nGranite cubes| 50x50x50mm| 9.0m2| 150m| 2,800  \n80x80x80mm| 5.7m2| 63m| 700  \n100x100x100mm| 4.5m2| 40m| 350  \n150x150x150mm| 3.0m2| 18m| 100  \nGranite setts| 100x100x50mm| 8.8m2| 75m| 680  \n200x75x150mm| 3.9m2| 35m| 165  \n200x150x100mm| 2.9m2| 26m| 120  \n300x100x200mm| 2.0m2| 19m| 62  \nGritstone setts| 150x125x100mm| 4.8m2| 32m| 110  \n200x150x150mm| 3.2m2| 19m| 70  \n275x100x200mm| 2.4m2| 20m| 75  \n  \n## Patterns\n\nAlthough it is possible to lay setts and cubes in almost any configuration or\ndesign, there are four key patterns that are seen time and time again with\nsett work in Europe. These are:-\n\n  * Coursed\n  * Random\n  * Fan\n  * Bogen\n\nSee the Laying Pages for details on different laying techniques.\n\n### Coursed\n\nThis is without doubt the most popular pattern and much of the 18th and 19th\ncentury sett work laid to the streets and squares of towns and cities is laid\nto this pattern. It's the traditional 'cobbled streets' pattern, with the\ncourses running at 90\u00b0 to the direction of traffic (transverse), and it often\nfeatures a longitudinal (running in same direction as traffic flow) channel at\neach edge, as shown in the photograph opposite.\n\nA coursed pattern is very simple to lay. The newly-quarried and sawn stone\nsett paving now widely available, is cut to accurate rectangles and is ideally\nsuited to being laid in courses.\n\nReclaimed setts and hand-hewn materials are much more irregular and so need to\nbe laid to a taut string line to ensure the courses remain parallel and true\nto level. Coursework looks even better when cambered.\n\nWith coursework, it's important that the vertical joints are staggered,\nwhether the setts are new and close-jointed or reclaimed and mortar/pitch\njointed.\n\nDifferent sett widths help to create a more random and natural appearance to\nthe work. New setts are often supplied in standard widths, but a range of\nwidths can be specified if desired. Reclaimed materials often have to be\nsorted into compatible widths before laying each course, which adds to the\nlabour costs, but makes for a much more visually appealing finish.\n\n### Random\n\nUnlike the straight 'rows' of a coursed pattern, a random layout is basically\na jumble of stones positioned wherever they will fit. This method of laying\nwas typically used only on low status work, such as industrial yards, stables,\nhaul roads and other places where the presence of a hard surface was far more\nimportant than appearance, and/or where the budget was tight. Often, areas\npaved in a random pattern utilised the poorer quality setts, the rejects and\nodd sizes from a prestige job nearby or even reclaimed materials that was\nconsidered worn.\n\nSetts laid in random pattern\n\nThe same rules for layout creation given on the Random Layouts page apply to\nsetts as well as flags; running joints should be kept to a minimum (around\n600-900mm ideally, with setts) and the corners of 4 setts should never meet at\na single point. It can be a bit of a brain-teaser working out which stone will\nfit where, and the end results can look somewhat higgledy-piggledy, especially\nas the jointing tends to vary between butt-jointed (ie, setts in direct\ncontact with immediate neighbours) to wide joints of 75mm or so. The joint\nwidth is a good indicator of the quality of workmanship used to lay the paving\n- the wider the joints, the poorer the job.\n\nRandon laid setts, although some of the blocks of this laminar stone have\nsplit in-situ, enhancing the random look\n\nMost random work tends to be a borderline case between setts and cobbles. Just\nwhen does a cobble become a sett? How much dressing is required for a field\nstone or a cobble to qualify as a bone fide sett?\n\nThe Kentish Ironstone shown opposite would be teetering on the verge of the\ncobble/sett boundary, but would probably edge it as a sett by virtue of the\nrough attempt to create courses from what is a very random stone. In\nsituations like this, it can look fantastic, as long as the jointing doesn't\ndominate.\n\nGranite....errr....setts or cobbles?\n\n### European Fan Pattern\n\nThis pattern, also known as Belgian pattern or Florentine pattern amongst\nothers, is the most complicated pattern to set out, and only really works with\ncubes or setts of smaller plan dimensions. However, it is such a visually\npleasing layout that it's easy to see just why it has been so popular for so\nlong. It is a frequently used pattern in Europe and is a fairly common choice\nof pattern for Pattern Imprinted Concrete , although it looks far better in\nthe natural materials than in coloured concrete.\n\nIdeally, it needs a large area to do it full justice, and should be at least 3\nmetres wide when used as a driveway, otherwise the pattern becomes 'lost'.\nHowever, the smaller setts, such as the 100x100mm and smaller units, give\nexcellent results over comparatively small areas. Fans laid with contrasting\ncolours, eg a silver-grey granite and a black basalt, can look stunning when\ngiven the space for the pattern and colour to be appreciated.\n\nThe idealised setting-out pattern reproduced below can be adapted for most\nsquare paving units, including block paving and flags, as well as setts and\ncubes. If the paving unit is 'n' mm in width, then the radius, r, should equal\n10n. This 'rule of thumb' will need tweaking for any given setts as the\ndimensional accuracy, size range and scale of fan will all affect how 'tidy'\nthe completed fan looks when laid and jointed.\n\nIn practice, a number of wedge-shaped or trapezoidal setts are needed to\nprevent the joints becoming too wide, and a professional sett layer will\nusually rough-out a serviceable fan before preparing a template from which to\nwork.\n\nLack of cutting or wedge-shapes results in wide joints\n\nFans are usually mocked-up to check scale, contrast and joint width\n\nSetting out for a European Fan pattern\n\nLarge scale fans may have outer bands established first\n\nStandard scale fans are often laid using a template frame\n\n## Bogens\n\nIt's worth noting that there is often some confusion in Britain and Ireland\nregarding these \"arc\" patterns. The layout shown above is a fan: there are a\nnumber of repeating 'shapes' that interlock and cover a larger area. However,\non the continent, one of the more popular layouts is the bogen also known as a\nsegmental arc or even radial-sett paving , which is often mistaken for a fan\nbut is actually a series of stacked arcs. Bogen layout is complex and requires\nthe skills of an experienced artisan as the setts at the ends of the arcs,\nwhere one arc meets its neighbour, need to be somewhat smaller than those in\nthe centre of each arc.\n\nFan layout - note individual, repeating fans\n\nBogens - a series of stacked and interlocking arcs\n\nTraditionally, bogens are incredibly strong layouts as the arcs work to\ndissipate forces over a much larger area. Their development and use reached a\npeak when horse-drawn traffic dominated the streets, but since the advent of\nmodern vehicles, their use has been gradually demoted to one of aesthetics.\nHowever, they remain popular in continental Europe and there has been a sign\nof renewed interest in both Britain and Ireland since the price and\navailability of imported granite setts became more favourable in the early\nyears of the 21st century.\n\nBogens at Belfast City Hall\n\nTypical layout plan for bogens\n\nSimply stunning Porphyry bogen driveway by Brockstone Construction\n\n## Pros and Cons\n\nThe 'domed' surface of the \"Hovis-loaf\" type reclaimed setts can be awkward to\nwalk on, especially in high-heeled shoes (or so I'm told!)\n\nThe irregular nature of the surface can also make access difficult for hand-\npushed garden tools such as non-pneumatic tyre wheelbarrows, and lawnmowers.\nEven relatively flat-topped setts can be difficult to traverse if the jointing\nis recessed, but the newer sawn setts have wonderfully smooth and level faces,\nand being laid butt-jointed as is concrete block paving, they present no\nhazard whatsoever, regardless of which footwear one is wearing.\n\nProperly constructed sett paving is more or less completely impermeable and\ntherefore must be adequately drained to gullies or other suitable drainage\npoints .\n\nOnce complete, it should require no maintenance other than the occasional\nsweep with a broom to remove accumulated dust, etc. Some of the imported\nsandstone setts can be something of an algae-magnet, so regular cleaning may\nbe required or it may be considered worthwhile to treat them with a suitable\nsealant .\n\nRelatively expensive - good work costs good money. There are plenty of\nchancers who claim they can lay setts and then proceed to bollix the job\nbecause they simply do not have the relevant experience, and it's that\nexperience that costs. While the setts themselves can be found from \u00a330 per\nsquare metre (and upwards) a top-class streetmason or sett-layer will often\ncharge \u00a340-\u00a36per m2 to lay them.\n\nWhen laid well, or when laid to a fan pattern, they can look stunning. All too\noften the reclaimed or hand-hewn setts are laid slap-dash and then have plain\n'white' mortar slapped all over them as an attempt at pointing.\n\nTime consuming and labour intensive....not to be undertaken by the faint\nhearted.\n\nIf you are employing a paving company to lay reclaimed or hand-hewn setts for\nyou, insist on seeing some previous work in the same materials; the skills\nrequired in laying irregular setts are not the same skills used with block\npaving or the regular-dimensioned sawn setts.\n\nFor an easier and cheaper alternative to cobbles and setts, take a look at\nsome of the concrete sett blocks now available from the top manufacturers and\ndescribed more fully in the relevant section of this site. There is a wide\nrange available, including flat, tumbled blocks, domed-top blocks, textured\nsurface blocks and some pretty disgusting and unconvincing 'copies'. As all\nthese blocks can be screed bedded and sand jointed, the labour rate is\nsignificantly reduced and therefore they are considerably cheaper than either\nreclaimed or new stone.\n\nConcrete Sett Paving\n\n## Buying Advice\n\nSetts can be quite expensive, especially the 'newly quarried' stones, although\nthe new, thinner setts specifically sawn for residential projects do help keep\nthe cost to an acceptable level. Prices for new materials range between \u00a330\nand \u00a3180 per square metre, depending on thickness, type of stone, finish and\nquantity.\n\nReclaimed (\"second-hand\") granite setts can command a price of \u00a3120-250 per\ntonne (equivalent to around \u00a330-65 per square metre), while gritstone setts\nare cheaper, starting at around \u00a340 per tonne (\u00a312.50 per m2) for uncleaned,\nunsorted low-grade stuff. The price for reclaimed materials is highly\nvariable, with significantly higher prices being charged in the SE of England.\n\nThere is massive variation in prices charged for the actual laying of sett\nwork. Some of this is because of the wide range of prices quoted for different\nmaterials, and some is because of the high level of workmanship required to\nachieve the best results.\n\nClose-jointed new sett work is much quicker to lay and consequently costs less\nin labour per unit area than the individually laid hewn setts or cubes, which\ntake almost as long to joint and seal as they do to lay. See the sett\nconstruction page for more information.\n\n### Buy by area or buy by weight?\n\nMost suppliers sell by weight, not by area, relying on the professionals to\nknow what typical coverage is achieved per tonne of various different sett\ntypes. This method of buying/selling is preferred because weight is\nindisputable - an alleged tonne of setts either weighs a tonne or it doesn't,\nand it's easy to check, whereas selling by area is vague and open to abuse.\n\nA trader can't possibly know what joint width any given sett-layer will\nachieve. It's all well and good them saying that with a 10mm joint this\nlot/bag/crate of setts will cover 10m2, but joint width will vary, from the\nankle-snapping (like that truly bloody awful installation on Coronation Street\n- must be at least 25mm between each sett \u2013 the jointing mortar supplier must\nhave loved that job!) to the 'fag-paper' width joints where adjacent setts are\nactually touching.\n\nI would never buy from a trader selling setts by area. My attitude is that\nsuch an arrangement is set up to deceive. What's to stop some charlatan\nselling 9 setts as capable of covering a square metre, which they possibly\nwould if they were laid with 300mm wide joints?\n\nIn theory, 43 setts at 200x100mm should just about cover a square metre\nallowing for 10mm joints, but that makes no allowance for wastage, and there\u2019s\nnearly always one or two plug-ugly setts in every barrowful. Then, if the\njoint width was reduced to, say, 6mm, just 4mm narrower, then roughly 46 setts\nare required for each m2. And with close jointing (1-3mm) that goes up to 49\nsetts short for every m2.\n\nThe coverage table above gives a reliable guide to the expected coverage for\nvarious popular types of setts but be aware that wastage AND joint width will\nhave an impact on just what sort of coverage is actually achieved on any\nparticular project.\n\nThe professional sett layer buys by weight, relying on experience to know what\nsort of coverage figure to expect for a given pattern and style of laying, and\nmaking an educated allowance for wastage (often around 5%).\n\n## Construction Diagram\n\nSee the Laying Setts page for fuller construction details\n\nTypical bound/rigid construction for new, reclaimed or irregular setts\n\n## Related Pages\n\n  * Laying Setts - Rigid Construction\n  * An Introduction to Sett Laying Techniques\n  * Laying Setts - Jointing Methods\n  * Laying Setts - Flexible Construction\n  * Laying Reclaimed Setts\n  * Laying a Cobble Pavement\n  * Jointing and Pointing for Stone Paving - Introduction\n  * Constructing Edge Courses for Pavements\n  * British Standards and other approved documents used in Paving, Drainage and Landscaping projects\n  * Stone Block Pavers\n\n  * Paving Types\n\n    * Block Paving\n    * Flags and Slabs\n    * Natural Stone Flags\n    * Porcelain Paving\n    * Permeable Modular Paving\n    * Resin Surfacing and Paving\n    * Setts, cubes and cobbles\n    * Plain Concrete Bases\n    * Decorative Concrete Surfaces\n    * Tarmacadam Surfacing\n    * Gravels, Hoggin and Shingle\n    * Cellular Pavers and Ground Reinforcement\n    * Special Purpose Paving\n    * Other Garden Paving\n    * Edgings, edge restraints and kerbs\n\n  * Installation Topics\n\n    * DIY Block Paving Projects\n    * Random Layout Design\n    * Cutting Flags\n    * DIY Patio Paving\n    * Setting Out\n    * Ground Preparation\n    * Drainage for Paving and Gardens\n    * Hard Landscape Features\n    * Walls and Brickwork\n    * Recess Tray Covers\n    * Mortars and Concretes for Paving\n    * Jointing for Paving\n    * Jointing with Cement Mortars\n    * Jointing with Resin Mortars\n    * Repair, alteration and maintenance of paving\n    * Refurbishment of a block paved driveway\n    * Sealants for Paving\n    * Standards and Specs\n    * Paving Manufacture\n    * Working Safely\n    * Tools for Paving Installers\n    * Calculators\n    * FAQs\n\n  * Buying & Contractor Advice\n\n    * Purchasing Paving\n    * Finding a Good Contractor\n    * Suppliers\n\n  * Our Services\n\n    * Ask a Question\n    * Quality Reports\n    * Layouts\n    * For Contractors\n    * For Manufacturers\n    * Product Library\n    * What's This Paving?\n    * Bookshop\n    * Design/Consult\n    * Design Portfolio\n    * Design Library\n    * Project Management\n    * Build Portfolio\n    * Training Group\n\n  * About Us\n\n    * History of AJ McCormack & Son\n    * Tony's Book\n    * Blogs\n    * Comic Corner\n    * Visitor Book\n    * News\n\nAJ McCormack & Son\n\n32, Newchurch Lane Culcheth, Nr.
