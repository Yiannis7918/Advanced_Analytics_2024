The\nneed to define, depict, and correctly blazon the various tinctures is one of\nthe most important aspects of heraldic art and design.\n\n## Development and history[edit]\n\nThe use of tinctures dates back to the formative period of European heraldry\nin the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The range of tinctures and the manner\nof depicting and describing them has evolved over time, as new variations and\npractices have developed.\n\nThe basic scheme and rules of applying the heraldic tinctures dates back to\nthe 12th century. The earliest surviving coloured heraldic illustrations, from\nthe mid-thirteenth century, show the standardized usage of two metals, five\ncolours, and two furs. Since that time, the great majority of heraldic art has\nemployed these nine tinctures.^[1]^[2]\n\nOver time, variations on these basic tinctures were developed, particularly\nwith respect to the furs. Authorities differ as to whether these variations\nshould be considered separate tinctures, or merely varieties of existing ones.\nTwo additional colours appeared, and were generally accepted by heraldic\nwriters, although they remained scarce, and were eventually termed stains,\nfrom the belief that they were used to signify some dishonour on the part of\nthe bearer.^[3] The practice of depicting certain charges as they appear in\nnature, termed proper, was established in the seventeenth century. Other\ncolours have appeared occasionally since the eighteenth century, especially in\ncontinental heraldry, but their use is infrequent, and they have never been\nregarded as particularly heraldic, or numbered among the tinctures that form\nthe basis of heraldic design.^[4]\n\n### Frequency and national variants[edit]\n\nThe frequency with which different tinctures have been used over time has been\nmuch observed, but little studied. There are some general trends of note, both\nwith respect to the passage of time, and noted preferences from one region to\nanother.\n\nIn medieval heraldry, gules was by far the most common tincture, followed by\nthe metals argent and or, at least one of which necessarily appeared on the\nmajority of arms (see below). Among the colours, sable was the second most\ncommon, followed by azure. Vert, although present from the formative period of\nheraldic design, was relatively scarce.^[5] Over time, the popularity of azure\nincreased above that of sable, while gules, still the most common, became less\ndominant. A survey of French arms granted during the seventeenth century\nreveals a distinct split between the trends for the arms granted to nobles and\ncommoners. Among nobles, gules remained the most common tincture, closely\nfollowed by or, then by argent and azure at nearly equal levels; sable was a\nvery distant fifth choice, while vert remained scarce. Among commoners, azure\nwas easily the most common tincture, followed by or, and only then by gules,\nargent, and sable, which was used more by commoners than among the nobility;\nvert, however, was even scarcer in common arms.^[6] Purpure is so scarce in\nFrench heraldry that some authorities do not regard it as a \"real heraldic\ntincture\".^[7]\n\nOn the whole, French heraldry is known for its use of azure and or, while\nEnglish heraldry is characterized by heavy use of gules and argent, and unlike\nFrench heraldry, it has always made regular use of vert, and occasional, if\nnot extensive, use of purpure. German heraldry is known for its extensive use\nof or and sable.^[1] German and Nordic heraldry rarely make use of purpure or\nermine, except in mantling, pavilions, and the lining of crowns and caps.^[8]\nIn fact, furs occur infrequently in German and Nordic heraldry.^[9]\n\n## List[edit]\n\nHeraldic tinctures (excluding furs)Class| Metals| Colours| Stains  \n---|---|---|---  \nName| Argent| Or| Gules| Sable| Azure| Vert| Purpure| Murrey| Sanguine| Tenn\u00e9  \nTincture  \nNon-heraldic equivalent| Silver/White| Gold/Yellow| Red| Black| Blue| Green|\nPurple| Mulberry| Blood red| Tawny  \nMonochromatic designations| Hatching  \nTricking abbr.| ar.| o.| gu.| s., sa.| as., bl., b.| vt., v.| purp., pu., p.|\nm.| \u264c\ufe0e| \u264c\ufe0e  \nPoetic designations| Heavenly body| Moon, \u263e| Sun, \u2609| Mars, \u2642| Saturn, \u2644|\nJupiter, \u2643| Venus, \u2640| Mercury, \u263f| Dragon's Tail, \u260b| Dragon's Tail, \u260b| Dragon's\nHead, \u260a  \nJewel| Pearl| Topaz| Ruby| Diamond| Sapphire| Emerald| Amethyst| Sardonyx|\nSardonyx| Jacinth  \nTable of the tinctures and furs\n\nThe colours and patterns of the heraldic palette are divided into three\ngroups, usually known as metals, colours, and furs.\n\n### Metals[edit]\n\nThe metals are or and argent, representing gold and silver respectively,\nalthough in practice they are often depicted as yellow and white.^[10]^[11]\n\nOr (Ger. Gelb, Gold, or golden)^[12] derives its name from the Latin aurum,\n\"gold\". It may be depicted using either yellow or metallic gold, at the\nartist's discretion; \"yellow\" has no separate existence in heraldry, and is\nnever used to represent any tincture other than or.^[10]\n\nArgent (Ger. Wei\u00df, Weiss, Silber, or silbern)^[12] is similarly derived from\nthe Latin argentum, \"silver\". Although sometimes depicted as metallic silver\nor faint grey, it is more often represented by white, in part because of the\ntendency for silver paint to oxidize and darken over time,^[i] and in part\nbecause of the pleasing effect of white against a contrasting colour.^[10]\nNotwithstanding the widespread use of white for argent, some heraldic\nauthorities have suggested the existence of white as a distinct heraldic\ncolour.^[13]\n\n### Colours[edit]\n\nFive colours have been recognized since the earliest days of heraldry. These\nare: gules, or red; sable, or black; azure, or blue; vert, or green; and\npurpure, or purple.\n\nGules (Fr. gueules, Ger. Rot)^[14] is of uncertain derivation; outside of the\nheraldic context, the modern French word refers to the mouth of an\nanimal.^[15]\n\nSable (Ger. Schwarz)^[1] is named for a type of marten, known for its dark,\nluxuriant fur.^[ii]\n\nAzure (Fr. azur or bleu, Ger. Blau)^[14] comes through the Arabic l\u0101zaward,\nfrom the Persian l\u0101\u017eavard both referring to the blue mineral lapis lazuli,\nused to produce blue pigments.\n\nVert (Fr. vert or sinople, Ger. Gr\u00fcn)^[14] is from Latin viridis, \"green\". The\nalternative name in French, sinople, is derived from the ancient city of\nSinope in Asia Minor (Turkey), which was famous for its pigments.\n\nPurpure (Fr. purpure or pourpre, Ger. Purpur)^[14] is from Latin purpura, in\nturn from Greek porphyra, the dye known as Tyrian purple. This expensive dye,\nknown from antiquity, produced a much redder purple than the modern heraldic\ncolour; and in fact earlier depictions of purpure are far redder than recent\nones. As a heraldic colour, purpure may have originated as a variation of\ngules.\n\n#### Stains[edit]\n\nThree more tinctures were eventually acknowledged by most heraldic\nauthorities: sanguine, a venous-blood red, murrey, a dark red or mulberry\ncolour; and tenn\u00e9, an orange or dark yellow to brownish colour. These were\ntermed \"stains\" by some of the more influential heraldic writers, and supposed\nto represent some sort of dishonour on the part of the bearer; but in fact\nthere is no evidence that they were ever so employed, and they probably\noriginated as mere variations of existing colours.^[3]^[16] Nevertheless, the\nbelief that they represented stains upon the honour of an armiger served to\nprevent them receiving widespread use, and it is only in recent times that\nthey have begun to appear on a regular basis.^[17]\n\nSanguine from the Latin sanguineus, \"blood red\", one the so-called \"stains\" in\nBritish armory, is a dark blood red between gules and purpure in hue.^[11] It\nprobably originated as a mere variation of red and may in fact represent the\noriginal hue of purpure, which is now treated as a much bluer colour than when\nit first appeared in heraldry. Although long shunned in the belief that it\nrepresented some dishonour on the part of the bearer,^[iii]\n\nMurrey, from the Greek morum, \"mulberry\", it has found some use in the\ntwentieth and twenty-first centuries.^[iv]^[17] Murrey is also the official\ncolour of the Order of the Bath ribbon.\n\nTenn\u00e9 or tenny or tawny, from Latin tannare, \"to tan\", is the third of the so-\ncalled \"stains\". It is most often depicted as orange, but sometimes as tawny\nyellow or brown. In earlier times it was occasionally used in continental\nheraldry, but in England largely confined to livery.^[3]^[18]\n\n### Furs[edit]\n\nCanons from the chapter of Bruges, solemn winterdress in fur\n\nThe use of heraldic furs alongside the metals and colours dates to the\nbeginning of the art. In this earliest period, there were only two furs,\nermine and vair.^[v] Ermine represents the fur of the stoat, a type of weasel,\nin its white winter coat, when it is called an ermine. Vair represents the\nwinter coat of the red squirrel, which is blue-grey above and white below.\nThese furs were commonly used to line the cloaks and robes of the nobility.\nBoth ermine and vair give the appearance of being a combination of metal and\ncolour, but in heraldic convention they are considered a separate class of\ntincture that is neither metal nor colour. Over time, several variations of\nermine and vair have appeared, together with three additional furs typically\nencountered in continental heraldry, known as plumet\u00e9, papelonn\u00e9, and k\u00fcrsch,\nthe origins of which are more mysterious, but which probably began as\nvariations of vair.^[19]\n\n#### Ermine[edit]\n\nMain article: Ermine (heraldry)\n\nErmine\n\nErmine (Fr. hermine, Ger. hermelin) is normally depicted as a white field\npowdered with black spots, known as \"ermine spots\", representing the ermine's\nblack tail. The use of white instead of silver is normal, even when silver is\navailable, since this is how the fur naturally appears; but occasionally\nsilver is used to depict ermine.^[19] There is considerable variation in the\nshape of ermine spots; in the oldest depictions, they were drawn\nrealistically, as long, tapering points; in modern times they are typically\ndrawn as arrowheads, usually topped by three small dots.\n\n#### Vair[edit]\n\nMain article: Vair\n\nVair\n\nVair (Ger. Feh) derives its name from Latin varius, \"variegated\". It is\nusually depicted as a series of alternating shapes, conventionally known as\npanes or \"vair bells\", of argent and azure, arranged in horizontal rows, so\nthat the panes of one tincture form the upper part of the row, while those of\nthe opposite tincture are on the bottom. Succeeding rows are staggered, so\nthat the bases of the panes making up each row are opposite those of the other\ntincture in the rows above and below. As with ermine, the argent panes may be\ndepicted as either white or silver; silver is used more often with vair than\nwith ermine, but the natural fur is white.^[20]^[21]\n\nWhen the pattern of vair is used with other colours, the field is termed vair\u00e9\nor vairy^[vi] of the tinctures used. Normally vair\u00e9 consists of one metal and\none colour, although ermine or one of its variants is sometimes used, with an\nermine spot appearing in each pane of that tincture. Vair\u00e9 of four colours\n(Ger. Buntfeh, \"gay-coloured\" or \"checked vair\") is also known, usually\nconsisting of two metals and two colours.^[20]^[21]\n\nSeveral variant shapes exist, of which the most common is known as\npotent^[vii] (Ger. Sturzkr\u00fcckenfeh, \"upside-down crutch vair\"). In this form,\nthe familiar \"vair bell\" is replaced by a T-shaped figure, known as a \"potent\"\ndue to its resemblance to a crutch. Other furs sometimes encountered in\ncontinental heraldry, which are thought to be derived from vair, include\nplumet\u00e9 or plumetty and papelonn\u00e9 or papellony. In plumet\u00e9, the panes are\ndepicted as feathers; in papelonn\u00e9 they are depicted as scales, resembling\nthose of a butterfly's wings (whence the name is derived). These can be\nmodified with the colour, arrangement, and size variants of vair, though those\nvariants are much less common. In German heraldry there is also a fur known as\nK\u00fcrsch, or \"vair bellies\", consisting of panes depicted hairy and\nbrown.^[20]^[21] Here the phrase \"vair bellies\" may be a misnomer, as the\nbelly of the red squirrel is always white, although its summer coat is indeed\nreddish brown.\n\n  * Potent\n\n  * Plumet\u00e9 or and sable\n\n  * Gules, papelonn\u00e9 or\n\n  * K\u00fcrsch\n\n### Other tinctures[edit]\n\nSeveral other tinctures are occasionally encountered, usually in continental\nheraldry:\n\n  * Cendr\u00e9e, or \"ash-colour\";^[viii]\n  * Brun\u00e2tre (Ger. Braun), or brown, occasionally used in German heraldry, in place of purpure;^[ix]\n  * Bleu-c\u00e9leste or bleu de ciel, a sky blue colour intended to be lighter than azure;^[x]\n  * Amaranth or columbine, a strong violet-red, found in at least one grant of arms to a Bohemian knight in 1701;\n  * Eisen-farbe, or iron-colour, found in German heraldry\n  * Carnation, often used in French heraldry as the colour of white human skin.\n\nThe heraldic scholar A. C. Fox-Davies proposed that, in some circumstances,\nwhite should be considered a heraldic colour, distinct from argent. In a\nnumber of instances, a label or collar blazoned as \"white\" rather than\n\"argent\" appears on a supporter blazoned argent or or. The use of \"white\" in\nplace of \"argent\" would be consistent with the Victorian practice of heraldic\nblazon that discouraged repeating the name of a tincture in describing a coat\nof arms, but if it were merely intended as a synonym of \"argent\", this\nplacement would clearly violate the rule against placing metal on metal or\ncolour on colour (see below). This difficulty is avoided if \"white\" is\nconsidered a colour in this particular instance, rather than a synonym of\n\"argent\".^[22] This interpretation has neither been accepted nor refuted by\nany heraldic authority, but a counter-argument is that the labels are not\nintended to represent a heraldic tincture, but are in fact white labels\nproper.\n\nOther exceptional colours have occasionally appeared during the twentieth and\ntwenty-first centuries:\n\nThe arms of the Jewish Autonomous Region in Russia have a field of aquamarine.\n\nThe Canadian Heraldic Authority granted arms containing rose as a colour in\n1997.^[xi] In 2002, the Authority granted arms including copper, treated as a\nmetal, to the municipality of Whitehorse, Yukon.\n\nOchre, both red and yellow, appears in South African heraldry; the national\ncoat of arms, adopted in 2000, includes red ochre, while (possibly yellow but\nmore likely red) ochre appears in the arms of the University of\nTranskei.^[23]^[24]\n\nIn the United States, heraldry is not governed by any official authority; but\nthe United States Army, which makes extensive use of heraldry, does have its\nown authority, the United States Army Institute of Heraldry. The armorial\ndesigns of the Institute of Heraldry include a number of novel tinctures,\nincluding buff (employed variously as either a metal or a colour),^[25] and\nhorizon blue.^[26] Silver gray has appeared in the heraldry of both the Army\nand the Air Force.^[27]^[28] Bronze appears as a colour in the arms of the\nSpecial Troops Battalion of the 2nd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division.^[29] There\nseems to be some confusion about the colour crimson, as in some cases it is\ntreated as a separate tincture, while in others it is used to specify the\nshade of gules to be employed by the artist.^[30] Similar issue exists about a\nblue-green colour referred to as teal^[31]^[32]^[33] or turquoise^[34]^[35]\nwhich is either treated separate or as a specific shade of azure or c\u00e9leste.\nDiffering from most heraldic practice, the Institute of Heraldry often\nspecifies the exact shades to be used in depicting various arms.\n\nBuff is also used by the Canadian Heraldic Authority, who treat it as a\ncolour.\n\n#### Proper[edit]\n\nA charge that is coloured as it naturally appears is blazoned proper (Fr.\npropre), or \"the colour of nature\".^[36]^[37] Strictly speaking, proper is not\na tincture in itself, and if, as is sometimes the case, a charge is meant to\nbe depicted in particular colours that are not apparent from the word \"proper\"\nalone, they may be specified in whatever detail is necessary.^[xii]^[36]^[37]\nCertain charges are considered \"proper\" when portrayed with particular\ncolours, even though a range of different colours is found in nature; for\ninstance, a popinjay proper is green, even though wild parrots occur in a\nvariety of colours. In some cases, a charge depicted in a particular set of\ncolours may be referred to as \"proper\", even though it consists entirely of\nheraldic tinctures; a rose proper, whether red or white, is barbed vert and\nseeded or.^[38]\n\nThe most extensive use of non-heraldic colours is probably associated with\n\"landscape heraldry\", a common feature of British and German armory during the\nlatter part of the eighteenth century, and the early part of the nineteenth.\nAlthough rarely used for the field itself, landscapes were often granted as\naugmentations, typically depicting a fortress successfully captured or\ndefended, or a particular ship, or a battle in which the armiger to whom the\naugmentation was granted was involved. Such landscapes, usually appearing on a\nchief, might be blazoned with great particularity as to the things portrayed\nand the colours used to portray them. Officially, these landscapes appeared on\na field of argent, but it was common, and perhaps expected, for the artist to\nadd further details, such as the sky and clouds, by which the field might be\nwholly obscured. The use of landscapes in heraldry fell out of fashion during\nthe Victorian era, when heraldic scholars and artists began looking to earlier\nand simpler periods of armorial design for inspiration.^[39]\n\n## Terminology[edit]\n\nIn the English-speaking world, heraldic terminology is based largely on that\nof British armory, which in turn is based on Norman French. With respect to\nthe heraldic tinctures, French heraldry, which is often cited by heraldic\nauthors, uses similar terminology. However, German heraldry, also highly\ninfluential, uses a different vocabulary; it calls the colours by their\neveryday names.^[xiii]\n\nIn its original sense, tincture refers only to the group conventionally\nreferred to as \"colours\".^[10] But as the word \"colour\" seems inapplicable to\nthe heraldic furs, and no other term clearly encompasses all three classes,\nthe word \"tincture\" has come to be used in this broader sense, while \"colour\"\nhas acquired the more restricted sense originally given to \"tincture\".^[11]\nThus, when consulting various heraldic authorities, care must be taken to\ndetermine which meaning each term is given.\n\n## Designations[edit]\n\n### Artistic liberties[edit]\n\nIn most heraldic tradition, the various metals and colours have no fixed\nappearance, hue, or shade. The heraldic artist is free to choose a lighter or\ndarker blue or green, a deeper or brighter red; to choose between depicting or\nwith yellow or any of various gold paints, to depict argent as white or\nsilver.^[40] Recently the College of Arms explained, \"there are no fixed\nshades for heraldic colours. If the official description of a coat of arms\ngives its tinctures as Gules (red), Azure (blue) and Argent (white or silver)\nthen, as long as the blue is not too light and the red not too orange, purple\nor pink, it is up to the artists to decide which particular shades they think\nare appropriate.\"^[17]\n\n### In blazoning[edit]\n\nMain article: Blazon\n\nMost heraldic authors do not capitalize the names of the various tinctures,\nalthough a few do (sometimes inconsistently), and some who do not capitalize\nthe other tinctures recommend capitalizing or in order to avoid confusion with\nthe conjunction. However, there are relatively few occasions in which the\nconjunction \"or\" would appear in the blazon of a coat of arms, and if properly\nworded, which meaning is intended should be readily apparent from the\ncontext.^[1]^[41] Another convention has been to capitalize only the first\nword or the first tincture appearing in the blazon, but no other words.^[42]\nIn the elaborate calligraphy appearing on most grants of arms, all of the\ntinctures are capitalized, as indeed are the names of the charges, but this is\npurely a matter of decorative style, and in no way does the manner of\ncapitalization used in the original grant affect how the arms may be described\non other occasions.\n\nA long-standing heraldic tradition has been to avoid repeating the names of\ntinctures multiple times in any given blazon. If it is possible to mention\nmultiple charges of the same tincture at once, followed by the name of the\ntincture, then this problem is avoided, but when it is impossible to combine\nelements of the same tincture in this manner, more creative descriptions may\nbe used. For example, instead of \"gules, on a fess or between three chess-\nrooks argent, a lion passant gules, armed and langued argent\", one might say,\n\"gules, on a fess or between three chess-rooks argent, a lion passant of the\nfield, armed and langued of the third.\" Similar phrases include \"of the last\"\nand \"of the like\". Alternately, descriptions such as \"gold\" and \"silver\" might\nbe substituted for \"or\" and \"argent\" on a subsequent occurrence. Another rule\nof blazon relating to tinctures suggests the placing of a comma after each\noccurrence of a tincture.^[43]\n\nIn recent years, the College of Arms has regularly dispensed with many of\nthese practices, believing them to cause confusion, and in new grants of arms,\nthe names of tinctures are repeated on each instance that they occur. The\nnames of all tinctures and charges are capitalized, although the word\n\"proper\", indicating the colour of nature, is not, and internal commas are\nentirely omitted.\n\n#### Rule of tincture[edit]\n\nMain article: Rule of tincture\n\nThe first so-called \"rule\" of heraldry is the rule of tincture: metal should\nnot be placed upon metal, nor colour upon colour, for the sake of contrast.\n\nThe main duty of a heraldic device is to be recognized, and the dark colours\nor light metals are supposed to be too difficult to distinguish if they are\nplaced on top of other dark or light colours, particularly in poor light.\nThough this is the practical genesis of the rule, the rule is technical and\nappearance is not used in determining whether arms conform to the rule.\nAnother reason sometimes given to justify this rule is that it was difficult\nto paint enamel colours over other enamel colours, or with metal over\nmetal.^[citation needed]\n\nThis \"rule\" has at times been followed so pedantically that arms that violate\nit were called armes fausses \"false arms\" or armes \u00e0 enqu\u00e9rir \"arms of\nenquiry\"; any violation was presumed to be intentional, to the point that one\nwas supposed to enquire how it came to pass. One of the most famous armes \u00e0\nenqu\u00e9rir was the shield of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, which had gold crosses on\nsilver. This use of white and gold together is also seen on the arms of the\nKing of Jerusalem, the flag and arms of the Vatican, and the bishop's mitre in\nthe arms of Andorra. These uses of gold on silver indicate the exceptional\nholy and special status of these coats of arms. An example of \"colour on\ncolour\" is the arms of Albania, with its sable two-headed eagle on a gules\nfield.\n\nThe \"rule of tincture\" has had an influence reaching far beyond heraldry. It\nhas been applied to the design of flags, so that the flag of Saxe-Weimar-\nEisenach was modified to conform to the rule.^[44]\n\n#### Counterchanging[edit]\n\nWhen a charge or group of charges is placed across a division line, variation,\nor ordinary, it may be counterchanged (Fr. contre-chang\u00e9, but modern de l'un\nen l'autre, Ger. verwechselte Farben or verschr\u00e4nkte Farben), meaning that the\ncharges are divided the same way as the field upon which they rest, with the\ncolours reversed.^[45]^[46]\n\nArms of Behnsdorf: \"per pale Argent and Vert a tilia eradicated\ncounterchanged\"\n\nIn the municipal arms of Behnsdorf, Saxony-Anhalt, seen here, the field is\ndivided with the left half white (argent) and the right half green (vert), and\nthe counterchanged tree is green where it lies on the white part of the field,\nand white where it lies on the green part.\n\nThe flag of Maryland\n\nThe flag of Maryland is another example of counterchanging. The only U.S.\nstate flag to be directly based on English heraldry, it is the arms of George\nCalvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, who founded the colony of Maryland in 1632. In\nthe 1st and 4th quarters, the field is divided into six vertical bands of gold\n(or) and black (sable) with a diagonal band (a bend) in which the colours are\nreversed (i.e., the bend is counterchanged). The 2nd and 3rd quarters are\nthemselves quartered between white (argent) and red (gules) with a\ncounterchanged cross bottony that is red where it lies on the white part of\nthe field and white where it lies on the red part of the field.\n\nCounterchanging is rare in early heraldry; early examples from German heraldry\nare found in the late fifteenth-century Wernigerode Armorial;^[47] it becomes\nmore frequently applied from the seventeenth century onward, especially with\nthe substantial number of newly created coats of arms, of which some notable\nexamples include Baron Baltimore (1624), Nightingale baronets (1628), Barrett-\nLennard baronets (1801), Verney baronets (1818), and Baron Alvingham (1929).\n\nIn Scottish heraldry, charges are sometimes blazoned as counterchanged of\ndifferent colours from the field \u2013 for instance, per fess gules and azure, a\nsun in splendour counterchanged or and of the first. A more typical blazon for\nthis would be per fess gules and azure, a sun in splendour per fess or and of\nthe first.\n\nThe term countercoloured is sometimes used in place of counterchanged. The\narms of the Fenwick baronets were originally blazoned as silver, a chief gules\nwith six martlets countercoloured. In this case, three martlets argent rest on\na chief gules, while three martlets gules rest on the argent field. Some\nheraldic authorities regard the use of this term as erroneous.^[48]\n\n  * Examples of counterchanging\n  * Arms of the Gateshead Metropolitan Borough Council: Or a Chief Azure overall five Pallets counterchanged.\n\n  * Arms of Balfour, baronets of Albury Lodge.\n\n### Monochromatic presentation[edit]\n\n#### Hatching[edit]\n\nMain article: Hatching (heraldry)\n\nHatching guide by Jan Baptist Zangrius, 1600\n\nDuring the first half of the seventeenth century, the proliferation of the\nprinting press coupled with the persistence of difficulties in and expense of\ncolour printing prompted the development of a number of systems of hatching\nfor the purpose of depicting heraldic designs without the use of colour.\nIntended chiefly for printing and engraving, the system which eventually\ngained widespread acceptance was that of Silvestro de Petra Sancta, a Jesuit\npriest and heraldic scholar, originally published in 1638.^[49]\n\nIn Petra Sancta's method, illustrated in the table above, a separate hatching\nrepresents each metal and colour, while the furs are treated as combinations\nof metal and colour. Argent is represented by a plain field, while or is\nrepresented by a field strewn with dots. Gules is represented by vertical\nlines, azure by horizontal lines, and sable by a combination of horizontal and\nvertical lines. Diagonal lines running from dexter chief to sinister base\nrepresent vert, while purpure is the reverse, represented by diagonal lines\nrunning from sinister chief to dexter base. Sanguine is represented by\ndiagonal lines running in each direction, while tenn\u00e9 is represented by a\ncombination of horizontal lines and diagonal lines running from sinister chief\nto dexter base.^[50]\n\nNine additional hatchings, published by Marcus Vulson de la Colombi\u00e8re in\n1639, were intended to represent other colours, although none of them\ncorrespond with regular heraldic tinctures, and they have never been used in\nBritish armory. A combination of vertical lines with diagonal lines running\nfrom dexter chief to sinister base represents brown; blood red is represented\nby vertical lines combined with diagonal lines running from sinister chief to\ndexter base; earth-colour by horizontal and vertical lines combined with\ndiagonal lines running from dexter chief to sinister base; iron-grey by\ndiagonal lines running in each direction (the same as sanguine in Petra\nSancta's system); water-colour by broken horizontal lines; flesh-colour by\nbroken vertical lines; ashen-grey by a combination of broken horizontal and\nbroken diagonal lines; orange by broken vertical lines interspersed with dots;\nand the colour of nature by zig-zag lines running from dexter chief to\nsinister base.^[50]\n\n#### Tricking[edit]\n\nMain article: Tricking\n\nTricked arms of John Browne of Spexhall, Suffolk (1591)\n\nBefore the use of hatching to depict individual heraldic tinctures, it was\ncommon to label colours in heraldic designs with abbreviations, a practice\nknown as \"tricking\", when colours were unavailable. The arms would be drawn in\noutline, and the tinctures written in abbreviated form: O or or for or; A, ar,\nor arg for argent, G or gu for gules; S or sa for sable; Az or B for azure (B\nfor \"blue\" being used in older trickings to avoid confusion between ar and\naz); Vt for vert, Purp for purpure, and Pr for proper. Although most records\nof the College of Arms are in colour, the practice of tricking is used in all\nother cases, even after the widespread adoption of hatching for printing and\nengraving arms.^[1]^[51]\n\nFrench heraldry also uses tricking to depict heraldic tinctures, using O for\nor; A for argent; G for gules; S for sable; B for bleu (to avoid confusing\nazur with argent); V for vert (to avoid confusing sinople with sable); P for\npurpure or pourpre; and Pr for propre.^[1]\n\nIn German heraldry, G is used for gelb (gold); W for weiss (white); R for rot\n(red); S for schwarz (black); B for blau (blue); and Gr, or a shape like an\nupright leaf, for gr\u00fcn (green); German heraldry makes little use of purpure,\nbut in its place allows Br for braun (brown). These abbreviations may be\neither capitalized or lowercase.^[1]\n\n### Poetic representation[edit]\n\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

(October 2019) (Learn how\nand when to remove this template message)  \n---  \n  \nHeraldry has been influenced by allegorical and astrological views,^[citation\nneeded] including the idea of sympathies and antipathies among stars,\nminerals, animals, plants, and people.^[citation needed] Some tinctures were\nconsidered to represent astrological symbols.^[citation needed]\n\nThe lore of sympathies originated with the Babylonians, who saw gems and rare\nminerals as the concentrates of cosmic powers. ^[citation needed] Later, Pliny\nthe Elder's Natural History organized nature according to a system of\nsympathies and antipathies among species and other elements of the natural\nworld.^[52] This doctrine influenced medieval medicine, pharmacy, alchemy and\nalso heraldry. During the 1350s, the work of Bartolo de Sassoferrato\n(1313/1314\u20131357) linked Or to the sun, Azure to the element air, and Gules to\nthe element fire.^[full citation needed] Honor\u00e9 Bonet, a heraldist from\nProvence, declared in his work Arbre des Batailles (1387) that the metal gold\n(Or) is the noblest in the world because, due to its very nature, it is bright\nand shining and full of virtues.^[full citation needed] During the late\nmedieval period and Renaissance, there was an occasional practice of blazoning\ntinctures by gemstones, or by references to the seven classical \"planets\"\n(including the sun and the moon).^[53]\n\nThe work of Bonet influenced the 15th century Burgundian heraldist Jean\nCourtois (d. 1436), also known as the Sicily Herald. In his work Le Blason des\nCouleurs (1414), Courtois developed a heraldic system consisting of the\ntinctures, planets and carbuncles, together with the virtues, metals, months,\nthe zodiac, and weekdays.^[citation needed] His main contribution was the\ndevelopment of a gemstone-planetary blazon that related colour to gemstone to\nplanet: or, topaz, the sun; argent, pearl, the moon; gules, ruby, Mars; sable,\ndiamond, Saturn; azure, sapphire, Jupiter; vert, emerald, Venus; purpure,\namethyst, Mercury; tenn\u00e9, jacinth, dragon's head (ascending lunar node);\nsanguine/murrey, sardonyx, dragon's tail (descending lunar node).\n\nThe dragon's head (also called Anabibazon in astronomy and astrology) and\ndragon's tail (also called Catabibazon) were in use from ancient\ntimes.^[citation needed] In heraldry the dragon's head symbolizes a light\ncolour (tenn\u00e9), and dragon's tail symbolizes a dark colour (sanguine). In\nalchemy the dragon's head is the materia prima that is subjected to\ntransmutation to produce the philosopher's stone.^[54] During the process of\ntransmutation the light-coloured starting material is transformed to a darker\nand more reddish one. In astrology the dragon's head is connected to good\nluck, while the dragon's tail is unlucky. These links indicate that heraldry\nin the 15th century was strongly under the influence of magical views and\nalchemistic ideas, which were in turn connected to the lore of sympathies\nbetween colours, planets, gemstones, metals, virtues etc. ^[xiv]\n\nThe work of Jean Courtois was distributed in manuscripts and later in one of\nthe first books printed in French. During the Tudor and Stuart dynasties in\nEngland (1485\u20131702), it appeared in heraldry manuals. In his book Trait\u00e9 du\nblason (1465), Cl\u00e9ment Prinsault deals with the relation of colours to the\nvirtues, the seven planets, the 12 celestial signs, gemstones, weekdays, the\nthree elements etc.^[full citation needed] This book is among the earliest\nwritings on heraldry available today.\n\nThe English historian and heraldist Sir Henry Spelman (1564\u20131641) used the\nsymbols of the planets to designate tinctures in his 1654 book\nAspilogia.^[full citation needed] Sir John Ferne (d. 1609) enumerates 14\ndifferent methods of blazon: 1. by colours; 2. by planets; 3. by precious\nstones; 4. by virtues; 5. by celestial signs; 6. by the months of the year; 7.\nby the days of the week; 8. by the ages of man; 9. by flowers; 10. by the\nelements; 11. by the seasons of the year; 12. by the complexions of man; 13.\nby numbers; and 14. by metals.^[full citation needed]\n\nAs well as the main tinctures, tricking abbreviations for other tinctures such\nas Proper \u2013 ppr, pp, Ermine \u2013 er etc. existed in English and some other\nlanguages during the Renaissance. To designate carnation (carnea tinctura),\nthe zodiac sign of Leo was used in reverse (). German heraldry used trefoil to\ndesignate colours other than the seven main tinctures (\"qui ultimus color\nalibi signo trifolii \u2663 pinguitur\"). Spener (1717. p. 113)^[full citation\nneeded] also linked tenn\u00e9 and sanguine to the zodiac sign of Leo (\u264c\ufe0e) .\nRudolphi^[citation needed] also refers to trefoil (\u2663) as a designation of\ncolour vert, usually connected with Venus. He also assigned specific variants\nof astrological signs for dragon's head and dragon's tail (\u260a \u260b), derived from\nthe sign for Leo, to the tinctures orange and carnation, respectively.^[55]\n\nUltimately, a system of nine tinctures was developed, with dukes, earls, and\nbarons having their arms blazoned by gemstones, and princes, kings and\nemperors having arms blazoned by the planets. The Austrian troubadour and\nherald Peter Suchenwirt (c. 1320 \u2013 1395) used gemstones to designate the\ntinctures even earlier (c. 1355) in the coat of arms of the Hungarian king\nLouis the Great (1342\u20131382).^[xv] Konrad von W\u00fcrzburg (c. 1230 \u2013 1287) also\nmentioned coats of arms made of gemstones in his poem Turnier von Nantheiz (c.\n1258), for example describing the arms of the king of England as an escutcheon\ncovered with Arabian gold with leopards made of rubies (lines 310\u2013320).^[full\ncitation needed]^[xvi]\n\n## Footnotes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ At one point, aluminum paint was used for argent, as it was more resistant to oxidation; but its effect also faded with age.\n  2. ^ Despite the origin of the name, sable is always regarded as a colour, rather than a fur.\n  3. ^ A rare exception of sanguine in older heraldry, cited by Woodward and Burnett, were the arms of the Clayhills of Invergowrie: per bend sanguine and vert, two greyhounds courant bendways argent.\n  4. ^ For instance, the arms of Lewes Old Grammar School, granted October 25, 2012: Murrey within an Orle of eight Crosses crosslet Argent a Lion rampant Or holding in the forepaws a Book bound Azure the spine and the edges of the pages Gold and those of Woolf, granted October 2, 2015: Murrey a Snow Wolf's Head erased proper on a Chief Argent a Boar's Head coped at the neck between two Fleurs de Lys Azure.\n  5. ^ Although sable is also named after the dark pelt of a type of marten, it has always been regarded as a colour, rather than a fur.\n  6. ^ Sometimes, in older authorities, varry or verry.\n  7. ^ Occasionally, varry cuppy.\n  8. ^ Aschau of Bavaria: Cendr\u00e9e, a mount of three coupeaux in base, or.

His escutcheon is not disfigured by any flaws; it beams a silvery colour, and is divided in two equal parts. One field gleams in the light colour of pearls and rubies, and is polished for radiant, and there lie in the horizontal direction eight picked fesses; another field of blue celeste is redundantly graced by domed golden fleurs-de-lis that stood by the arms many times with their plentiful rays, which are very pleasant to see. The helmet's top decorates a richly decked golden crown with a lot of shining gemstones, smoothed to lustrous; from the crown standing off two ostrich feathers and between them to be seen the ermine neck of the ostrich; his eyes sparkling from the rubies towards the enemy, his bill is golden, in which he beautifully holds a handsomely curved horseshoe-shaped charge made of gold.
