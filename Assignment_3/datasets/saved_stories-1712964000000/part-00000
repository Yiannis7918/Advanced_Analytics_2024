I was not\na beta member, but I saw chatter from people who were on Twitter, and was\nfollowing that vagueposting about it to try to figure out what it was going to\nbe, so I joined day one of public launch, having read the first ASSC manifesto\n(ASSC being the company over Cohost). The most notable part of the manifesto\nto me was the part about their funding--basically, they are ethically opposed\nto venture capital (great!), so their funding strategy as of early 2020 when\nthey formed was that they had a rich friend who was going to help them out.\n\n> while we were griping about the tech industry and considering starting this\n> project back in September, a friend of ours stepped forward and let us know\n> that they had hit the lottery as an early technical employee at a startup\n> that had succeeded and gone public. the first public announcement we\u2019re\n> ready to make is: we have secured a deal with them for at least a year of\n> operating funding on a non-equity basis, and we are publicly committing that\n> we will never, under any circumstances, sell equity to non-employees.\n\nMy first instinct was definitely \"well, that's not sustainable, so I wonder\nwhat their plan is to stop taking money from their rich friend.\" Turns out\nthat plan was nothing as of writing this in early 2024. They are still taking\nmoney from the rich friend, and that money has run out, because rich friend is\nMIA.\n\nI'm getting ahead of myself, because I really want to start this by explaining\nwhat it is and why I'm writing it. But I wanted to set the stage for why I\nstarted following Cohost's development in the first place, and why their\nfinancials were of particular interest to me. Literally before even seeing the\nsite, before knowing what it was going to be, all I knew was a rich friend of\ntheirs was paying for it. If you're interested in the business end of\nwebsites, you're gonna be wanting to watch the numbers closely here.\n\nWith Cohost now in its worse financial predicament as of the time I'm writing\nthis, I have had a lot of thoughts about their puzzling financial choices\nbetween then and now. And a lot of this revolves around their financial\nupdates, which have been sporadic at best. There's been some weird elements to\nthem that I can't say anything for sure about, but that I have hunches about.\nSo I want to say from the beginning, this post is going to be a mix of facts,\nnumbers and opinions. I am going to say things that are definite facts that\nCohost has given us from their financial updates. I am going to do my best\nwith the numbers they have given us. And I am also going to share opinions I\nhave that I cannot hand you receipts for. I'm going to be talking my gut\nfeelings. In the past when I've done this about Cohost I've had people demand\nproof, but this isn't a post about allegations, this is a post about what I\nfeel about it and what I think is a likely possibilty for what is going on. I\ncould be wrong! I could be right! There's no way for me to know if I'll ever\neven find out either way! But I hope in sharing all of this that you at least\nunderstand why I'd come to those conclusions, whether you do yourself or not.\nI also want to do this as a way to put context to some of the financial\nreports, because if you weren't following them, you may not understand what\nwas happening with the site at different times in its history that affects the\nfinancial reporting. I think it's also worth mentioning that I am writing this\nin realtime as I go back through the reports again, so you're going on this\ntrip with me.\n\nOne last thing I want to preface this with is a disclaimer about numbers. This\npost is gonna be full of numbers, because it's about finances. But there are\ntwo problems with the numbers.\n\nOne, I am not a finance expert. I have no expertise here. If you'd like to\nsend me a quick note about something I typoed or added wrong or something,\nfeel free to use the contact info on the main page of this blog. In a way,\nforgetting to carry the one somewhere will probably not make a meaningful\ndifference in the point I'm trying to make, as we're talking about large\nnumbers where the scale is more important than whether it ends in a 5 or a 6.\nBut it would be nice to not just totally fuck the math up. I also expect to do\na little bit of rounding here and there, because it frankly doesn't matter\nthat much whether the Cohost team were being paid $87k a year at launch or\n$87,285.00. I also am not going to try to factor in interest on the loans, I\ndon't know what kind of rate that would be and I might as well just say the\nflat numbers we know, and you can just imagine that actually it's some amount\nmore.\n\nTwo, the numbers are...a bit nebulous. They're definitely numbers, but what\nthe numbers mean is a problem. This is part of why I have compared Cohost to\nthe recent Defector story about Autostraddle. Over the course of the site's\nhistory, the financial reports have changed formats, changed timeframes,\nchanged what is included and what is not. I am going to do my absolute best to\ntry to normalize these numbers and make sense of them, but I can't guarantee\nthat I'm interpreting them correctly or that one month's number is a 1:1\nrepresentation of another month's number in intent. This is 100% napkin math\nwe're going to have to do. And that's...part of my point here. It's actually\nnot all that clear sometimes what has been happening with the numbers on this\nsite. They've given us a lot of numbers, but whether you can do anything with\nthem is a different story. So I will try my best to make sense of them. For\nstuff that is vague or nebulous, I may speculate a bit on what they mean. But,\nthat's not something you should have to do with a financial update. It should\nbe pretty straightforward. But as the Autostraddle article above said...\n\n> \"Part of what\u2019s confusing for a lot of folks, myself included, about what\u2019s\n> happening right now at Autostraddle is that, in many ways, there has always\n> been a commitment to public transparency,\" said Rachel Kincaid, who rose\n> from unpaid intern to managing editor at Autostraddle before leaving in\n> 2021. \"There was always a lot of numbers available, but it\u2019s in a way that I\n> think I still never really felt clear on the holistic financial picture.\"\n\nSo the numbers are going to be vague ideas, because I don't have the numbers\nto do anything better than vague ideas. They will definitely paint a picture\nbut they won't be anything perfect, because I have imperfect data to work off\nof. I am an adult and I know very well that there's a lot more complexity to a\nbusiness's financials than just \"revenue minus expenses equals profit/loss\",\nbut the best we can do is keep it simple and big picture it because that's all\nwe have the insight for. And maybe all of my math is wrong and maybe I\nmisunderstood every single thing I read here...if that's the case, then you\nshould be asking why I had to do this in the first place? If the updates were\nclear and accurate, I would not be here trying to piece the puzzle together.\n\n## The Pre Cohost Era\n\nASSC's financials before our first Cohost financial update are not extremely\npublic or easy to figure out. However, we do know from the July 2022 financial\nreport that at the start of the company, they each made $80k flat in salary.\nIn a way this post is going to be a preview for the July 2022 update, since\nmost of the historical information is in that post. At the time of Cohost\nlaunching, it had just three members, Jae, Colin and Aidan. However, the ASSC\nblog posts only mention Jae and Colin as authors, so it's very possible Aidan\ncame on board somewhere between March 2021 and the public launch of Cohost. I\ndon't have a clear founding date for ASSC, but the Manifesto was in early\nMarch 2020, and they've talked about how they started it shortly before COVID\nlockdowns happened, so for the sake of argument let's just say they started in\nMarch of 2020. If they started earlier we don't have any useful data otherwise\nso we'll live with that.\n\nThey claim in this same post that they do cost of living adjustments every\nyear based on the change in the Consumer Price Index. I'm not going to start\ndigging into the historical data for that, but in the July 2022 update they\nwere making $87,285 each, so we can assume that in 2020 they were making $80k\neach, and in 2021 they were making between $80k and $87k.\n\nThe July 2022 update also states that their expense estimate was $86k per\nquarter with their three employees. However they state this is an overestimate\nto give themselves a buffer, and that they usually come in a couple thousand\nunder that. That's about $29k a month in expenses. I'm not sure what expenses\nthey had prior to launching Cohost. I know they have said they occasionally\nconsulted with lawyers when dealing with setting the business up, their terms\nof service, etc. They also pay for health insurance, that kind of thing.\n\nIn 2021, ASSC posts an anniversary update to their manifesto. I primarily just\nlink this to highlight this note about their finances:\n\n> \"we have enough cash on hand to work through 2021 at our current\n> projections; we might also be able to get additional funding beyond that,\n> but we\u2019re hoping to ship something by the time we need to pass the hat\n> again.\"\n\nCohost launches publicly on June 28th, 2022, after a few months of closed beta\ntesting with friends and family. Jae's first post (that I can find right now)\nwas December 9th, 2021. We can assume that they didn't start inviting friends\nand family the literal day they made the site live, so to make things easy\nlet's just say that Cohost started operating at the start of 2022. In terms of\nfinances all that matters from the beta period is whether or not Cohost Plus\nexisted, because that's what affects whether they started getting revenue yet.\nI don't know this piece of info. I'm just going to do the math this way--we're\ngoing to say that for 2020 and 2021 they did not have revenue, starting 2022\nthey did. If that's the case, then that is roughly 22 months of no revenue.\nThey said they usually come a couple thousand below their $86k a quarter\nbudget. If we take \"couple\" literally (might as well, we have nothing else to\ndo) and do our math from $84k, then that's about $28k a month. So at 22\nmonths, that is $616,000 of debt to start us off. However, there's an\nimportant addendum to this math--I have no idea how long $86k was their\nquarterly budget, and as far as I can tell, as of their early 2021 manifesto\npost it was just Colin and Jae, meaning that if Aidan came on later in 2021,\nthat $86k budget may have been only for part of that year. But again...we\ndon't know. $616k is the only math we can truly try to guess at, but it's a\nguess. Even if we subtract a year's salary for Aidan not being there in 2020,\neven if we're generous and go with the $80k number even though by 2021 it\nsounds like they would have increased it, that's still over a half a million\ndollars. So, through this post I'd like to attempt to do a running account of\nhow much debt they have. Just to be generous, I'm going to actually use\n$500,000 as a starting point. It's arbitrary but we were doing so much\nguesswork anyway, we might as well play in this space, but it's more likely\nthat we're underestimating than over here. We can just think of this value as\n\"Cohost's possible debt\". I'm also going to round all the cents off of this\nnumber because nobody wants to look at two extra numbers anyway, I'm sorry if\nmy imaginary number is a few dollars off in the end.\n\n## July 2022 Update\n\nJuly 2022 Update Link\n\nOn July 2022, Cohost staff announce they will begin doing monthly financial\nupdates (which...well you'll see). They indicate that they do internal\nauditing once a month for their all-hands meetings, so presumably this would\nbe taken directly from something they are doing already anyway.\n\nOne of the important aspects of this update is that it lays out definitions\nfor the terms they use. I linked the post but here's a basic rundown:\n\nConversion Rate is the percentage of users subscribed to Cohost Plus. This is\nbasically tracking how many people are converted to paying customers. Their\ngoal at this point is to keep this number over 5%.\n\nSubscriber churn is essentially the lost subscribers, the users who did\nsubscribe to Plus but then cancelled.\n\nMonthly Recurring Revenue, abbreviated MRR, is the amount of money coming in\nfrom Cohost Plus per month. This does not include merch sales, but does\ninclude 1/12 of the lump sum of a yearly subscription.\n\nMonthly Active Users, abbreviated MAU and sometimes referred to as Monthly\nActive Projects by Cohost, refers to the number of users who have taken action\non the site (liking posts, making posts, etc.).\n\nI do not expect to spend much time talking about conversion rates and\nsubscriber churn, as I'm more interested in the broad dollar figures, but\nsubscriber rates will come into play a few times so it's worth knowing the\nterminology.\n\nNow, the July 2022 update was posted August 5th, and some of the numbers here\nare grabbed live, like the current subscriptions. However it's five days, so\nI'm willing to just call this the data for July. Data for June may or may not\nbe included in this, it's unclear, but if they did include data from June it\nwould probably only be the two days or so after going public. Trying to lump\nthe numbers into months is going to become impossible later anyway.\n\nHere's our numbers:\n\nCohost is getting $1,692 in monthly revenue, with 358 active Plus\nsubscriptions. They also had some merch sales, and \"only\" lost $21,217. They\nare estimating their losses for Q3 2022 will end up being around $81,000. I\nprefer to stick to month to month personally, but sometimes we only have\nquarterly values, and this is an estimation on their end anyway. The main\nreason I add it is that they admit that July is going to be an abnormally high\nmonth for them having just gone public and don't expect it to hold up, hence\nexpecting to lose more in the coming months.\n\nThey do not list their expenses here, but if we look at their revenue and add\ntheir total loss for the month, it should be about $19,524. Around $20k seems\nto be roughly right for this quarter looking ahead.\n\nAs of their last all hands meeting, they had $158,711 in the bank. This would\nof course be what they have left from their most recent loan from their\nfriend, and would not include the debt owed from their total funding.\n\nCohost's Possible Debt value: $519,524.\n\n## August 2022 Update\n\nAugust 2022 Update Link\n\nWe start with a brief note about the MAU count--in the July post, Cohost\ncalculated this number by users they had activated. Now they are using users\nthat have actually engaged in activity: liking posts, sharing them, writing\nthem, etc. I believe they calculate this number this way from here on. This is\nimportant, because as of August they have 19,056 users, but only 17,310 of\nthem are activated, and only 4,314 of them are actually active users. That's\na...pretty different number at this scale. Previously they were counting 6,068\nactivated users as their MAU number, so this is down quite a bit, and likely\nwas nowhere near that number if they used this new calculation the previous\nmonth. But it's more realistic this way. They now have 476 Plus subscribers,\nso this went up. Their MRR for this month is $2,223, so up about $500 from\nlast month. But their expenses get...tricky now. What they tell us is that\nthey have so far \"only\" lost $43,417 this quarter. But, we aren't doing math\nfrom the quarters, we're trying to track what they're doing monthly, because\nthese are monthly updates. They lost $21,217 of that in July, leaving us with\n$22,200 for August, and yet unknown for September. Despite being someone who\nlikes rounding numbers off, it's a little weird to see them go from a number\nlike $21,217 to something a clean and even as $22,200, but I'll give the\nbenefit of the doubt here. Keep in mind that this is how much they've lost\ntotal, not their expenses. So using our typical revenue minus expenses math\nfrom before, we should expect expenses to be roughly $19,976.44.\n\nBut what I want to talk about is that we're starting to see why tracking\nCohost's finances is so hard, and why despite the talk about transparency,\nit's a little trickier than that. It's easy to look at a bunch of numbers and\nsay yes, numbers! Transparency! But you need to be able to use those numbers.\nIt's already hard because the timeframes are so inconsistent. The two reports\nwe have are both for \"a month\", but July might include some days from both\nJune and August (it's unclear!) and August is thus missing those days. The\nreport is roughly covering a month of time, but those months might overlap, or\nborrow days from each other, and some numbers are live numbers as of the day\nof posting and some are from specific cutoff dates. Sure, I can do the math\nand figure out from their Q3 loss number minus the previous month we know for\nthat month and know what their monthly loss was, but why are we bouncing back\nand forth for how we give these numbers out? Not to mention they frequently\nswitch between talking about net loss vs expenses, to the point where I had to\ndo some revising on this a few times due to mixing the two up. The lines are\nextremely fuzzy here and they don't get better with time.\n\nThere's something else that bothered me here...\n\n> \"As of today, we have a total of $158,711 in the bank. We still intend to\n> raise additional funding before the end of the year.\"\n\nDidn't you have exactly $158,711 in the bank in last month's update?\n\nWhat I think has happened is this: The previous update was posted on August\n5th, and covered July's expenses, which had already been paid out, so they had\n$158,711 in the bank. This update was posted August 30th, so August's expenses\nhave NOT been paid out yet, meaning that as soon as they do that they will\nhave $136,511 in the bank. Next month's update will make this even weirder,\nspoiler alert. I was going to save this until then, but I want you to start\nthinking about this now.\n\nIn this update we get a little bit of a breakdown of their expenses. They say\nthat this quarter, they have earned $13,326 and spent $56,653. Now, the\nquarter in question should be July, August and September. We've only done July\nand August. Earlier they said that they had an MRR of $1,692 and $2,223 for\nJuly and August's updates. This gives us $3,915, which...is a lot less than\n$13,326. I can't account for the several grand difference here. I guess it's\nnot from their monthly revenue, but...where did it come from? Now, there is a\npossible answer to this, but this comes purely from having seen a lot of these\nupdates, which nobody would have when this update was posted: it may be that\nthey have added yearly subscriptions into this number, which are not part of\nMRR but are still income. I can't tell you if they had enough of those to\ncover roughly a $9k difference. Maybe they did and it's that. Maybe they\ndidn't and I have no idea where it came from. But the important point here is\nthat we don't know and they didn't tell us. They just tossed $9k into the pile\nwithout explaining it, or telling us how it's divided up between the two\nmonths. Which means that our estimates for their expenses, that we had to\ncalculate ourselves, are going to be wrong. But they were probably going to be\nwrong anyway because...\n\nThe expenses complicate things as well. With our previous $19,524 and $19,976\nfigures, we have $39,500. But remember, we did that math ourselves. They told\nus what they've lost, and how much they budget per quarter for expenses, but\nthey haven't told us total expenses for these months, so all we can do is the\nbasic old formula. This post says that they have spent $56,653, that's quite a\nbit more. But that's fine, because they have a breakdown of the expenses, so\nmaybe we can figure it out.\n\nFor this quarter, about $44,000 of that $56,653 is payroll. That tracks (with\nsome rounding, which they did) for three employees at $87k only two months\ninto the quarter. So $22,000 a month. That's a bit more than the expenses we\ncalculated, but with the mystery income that probably checks out okay. Then we\nhave $5,200 on hosting, $5,000 on taxes, and $1,300 for their lawyer. That's\n$11,500. That comes a bit shy of $56,653, but they were probably doing some of\nthe same rounding and sanding off that I was doing. They shouldn't do that\nwith their financial reports like I do with a stupid blog post but whatever, I\ncan at least reconcile this.\n\nThey announce that they are going to hire a contractor to assist with\ndevelopment. They would go on to hire Jess for this. Jess is paid $50 an hour,\nmax 24 hours a week, for 12 weeks. According to them, the \"maximum cost\" of\nthis contract is $14,400, spread across September, October and December (so\npart of Q3 and part of Q4). But she does not start in August, so we aren't\ndoing any of this math yet, it's just worth putting the numbers out there for\nnow.\n\nThey expect at this point to end Q3 with $128,000 in the bank and end Q4 with\nat least $39,000.\n\nI don't want to talk about how much time it took me just to cover these two\nmonths, because of how many times I had to redo the math or found\ndiscrepancies that I had to reconcile to make the numbers as presented make\nsense, and it hasn't even gotten as bad as it'll get yet. These financial\nupdates never should have been harder than just here's our expenses, here's\nwhat those are made up of, here's our revenue, here's what that's made up of,\nhere's the totals. But they aren't that.\n\nCohost's Possible Debt value: $543,417.00 (at least they gave us their loss\nnumbers so this can still be calculated)\n\n## September 2022 Update\n\nSeptember 2022 Update Link\n\nI want to go into September 2022 pointing out that the August update was\nposted on August 30th, and the September update was posted on September 29th.\nIt would be so much easier if they waited for the month to be over to do the\nnumbers for it. But I shouldn't complain because this gets worse later, at\nleast this is close. But I say this because I'm pretty sure this is a big\nsource of a new problem we have, which is...\n\nCohost now has 3,837 active users, and they say that as of September 27th,\nthey are at 497 subscribers, up from 483 the month before.\n\nExcept in the last update they told us they had 476 the month before. Which\nbrings us to this month's MRR, which is at $2,305, up from $2,255 from last\nmonth. Except last month they told us it was $2,223. Anyway, both MRR and\nsubscribers are down no matter which set of numbers you use, and we're about\nto learn why the numbers are a nightmare anyway.\n\nThere's a big nasty section of this September update, which is an explanation\nthat their numbers from their last update were entirely fucked up.\n\nBasically, the end of month payroll was not being included in their expenses.\nBecause they were putting the reports out before the months were even over\n(worth noting--this one is September 29th, they didn't learn a lesson from\nthis). August's numbers are just totally fucked and unsalvageable. So all that\ntime I spent explaining them? Sorry, totally wasted. Don't worry, it wasted\nway more of my time writing it than it did you reading it, because I am\nrereading these as I write and I had totally forgotten this detail.\n\nSo, let's go back to August. Remember their money in the bank amount? Yes, in\nfact, it did go down in the month of August, that is now $136,224. But I want\nto highlight something else here:\n\n> This means that our estimated EOY cash on hand, which we initially estimated\n> at $39k, should have been closer to $16k. $23k is a lot to be off by!\n> Instead of having about an extra month and a half of runway, we have closer\n> to two weeks\n\nThis wasn't just them putting the wrong numbers into the report they showed\nthe public. Their own calculations were wrong this whole time. They didn't\nknow how much money they were working with.\n\nSo for September, they have $108,189 in the bank. They lost a total of $69,712\nin Q3. We know the August numbers are fucked up, but I need something to put\nthe column for September's net losses, and since they insist on giving us\nquarterly numbers despite telling us the monthly numbers we had were wrong,\nI'm just going to keep August at $22,200 for now and put down $26,295 under\nSeptember. If they didn't want me to have to guess they could have been\nexplicit about the numbers. And since they say \"Our proportion of expenses to\nrevenue hasn't meaningfully changed since last month, nor has what all the\nmoney is going to, so I'm not going to break it down again,\" I'm just going to\ndo revenue minus expenses and give us $23,989 for expenses this month.\n\nOn funding, they are having meetings to get more funding, and their biggest\nissue is \"figuring out how much money we actually want/need\". But this is\nstill coming from their one anonymous rich friend, it is not a new source of\nfunding just a new round.\n\nThere's a lot of promises for features they intend to ship, most of which they\nnever did, and that's it for September. I know we had to do a little guesswork\nto get some ballpark figures in July and August, but September has told us\nthat everything we did was completely wrong anyway and the numbers are just\nwhat we want to make of them, so that's what we'll keep trying to do.\n\nCohost's Possible Debt value: $569,712.00 (at least we know it's our starting\nhalf mil minus the Q3 loss so this is still a salvageable number for now)\n\n## October 2022 Update\n\nOctober 2022 Update Link\n\nOctober 2022 was...a rough month for Cohost outside of finances. This was the\nmonth of the first big sitewide argument about the lolicon/cub art rules. In\nfact I think this was the first big sitewide argument period. Lots and lots of\ndrama here, lots of people leaving as well. It was a huge complicated mess\nthat left its own mark on the site, and would need a whole different post to\ncover. But, you won't be able to tell that from the numbers, because this was\nalso a month in which Elon pissed off a ton of people and they chose to leave\nTwitter en masse, meaning some percentage of them decided to try Cohost!\n\nWe now have 38,165 users, up from 20,793 last month, I've not been tracking\ntotal users close enough to know if those numbers differed from last month's\nreport but whatever. Now they have 9k MAU, up from 3837 last month, which IS\nthe number they reported, but \"9k\" (as they wrote it themselves) is almost\ndefinitely a rounded number. Kind of annoying to switch to that when you were\ndoing exact numbers before. We're at $3,535 MRR and 763 subscribers. Up from\n$2,549 MRR and 550 subs.\n\nWhich, if you'll remember, were reported as $2305 and 497 in the last update.\nMeaning our numbers are still changing every month because we're still doing\nall the math before the month is over.\n\nRight now they say they have just over $85,000 in the bank, which is pretty\nconsistent with their monthly \"in the bank\" number dropping. They also say\nthough, \"We are still in the process of securing new funding from our existing\nfunder (\"the ball is entirely in our court; we need to decide how much we\nneed\"). At several times in these early reports they describe the money they\nare getting from their funder this way, where it sounds like their funder is\nwilling to give them as much as they want and they just need to name a number,\nwhich is something they seem to struggle to come up with occasionally.\n\nUnfortunately when we want to look at our actual profit/loss for this month,\nit's...a little iffy. The numbers have gotten less specific for these. They\nhave \"just over $85k in the bank\", and a Q4 spend thus far of \"a bit over\n$22k\". I'm just going to use these numbers as is for my math here, $85,000 and\n$22,000. Part of my problem is that I don't know what they mean by a \"spend\"\nhere--do you mean your expenses were $22k, or do you mean your net income for\nthe month was negative $22k? Given that they had $108,189 in the bank last\nmonth, and now have $85k or thereabouts, I am going to have to assume this is\nnet income, but this is definitely a judgement call because previous months\nexpenses have also been pretty close to a $22k amount. If we take it as net\nincome, that puts their expenses at $18,465, which is the lowest so far, but\nnot terribly far off from the average (the previous month apparently included\nhosting, as confirmed in this post, which is why it was a few thousand more\nthan average).\n\nAgain though, why am I having to do this kind of math to find out what they\nmean?\n\nCohost's Possible Debt value: $591,712.00\n\n## November 2022 Update\n\nNovember 2022 Update Link\n\nFor November, the update is posted on December 1st, so at least November was\nactually over when it was done.\n\nBut before we get to November's update, we need to add some context to\nNovember--on November 8th, Cohost announces that they are hiring for a\ncustomer support/moderator role. This would eventually be Kaara. As Cohost's\nstated structure is being worker owned with flat salaries that grow every year\nwith COL changes, this means an additional full salary will soon be thrown\ninto the finances.\n\nIt's worth pointing out how this update starts: by saying that they have good\nnews about the financial trajectory of the company (and bad news about being\n\"so fucking tired\").\n\nCohost's usercount is now 111,128, that's up from last month's 38,165 (which\nmatches October's reporting of October's numbers!). This is a massive leap\nthat is likely still coming from the people fleeing Twitter. MAU is now\n37,000, up from 9,000. Pretty large spike there of active users, which will\ncome up in their 'bad news' bit towards the end. But we have more numbers\nbefore that.\n\nSubscribers are now at 1852, with an MRR of $8,648.48. The last month's\nnumbers are 763 subs with $3,535 MRR, so again we're matching last month's\nreport again finally. Conversion rate however is significantly down from last\nmonth, because although a lot of new people are subscribing, far more people\nare joining.\n\nNow we get to our profit/loss bit. They have ended the month with $84,000 in\nthe bank, suggesting a net income of -$1,000. They refer to this as a\nprofitable month for November, because the negative amount was due to some\n\"mismanaged hosting resources\". To me that's not a profitable month, but I\nguess their thought is that \"well, that's just a weird little one off, it\ndidn't really count\".\n\nHere's the problem I have, that has really dug into me as I've tried to make\nsome kind of sense of these numbers rereading them fresh--it's actually\nextremely hard to get a sense of what is actually happening here, because of\nthe numbers they choose to give us. Telling us how much you have in the bank\nis a terrible metric here, especially when you can refill the bank with more\nloans. We don't know how much you were in debt, which if I was going to talk\nabout what I have in the bank I would find a way to add that in there, but it\nwould probably scare people off. I could tell you how much I have in my bank\naccount right now, but it wouldn't tell you what my total amount of money is,\nor my assets, or my debts.\n\nBut more importantly, telling us how much they took out of their bank account\nserves to obfuscate their sustainability, and I think the biggest reason for\nthis is yearly subs. Now, to be fair, they do point out the yearly sub issue\nin the post...after highlighting the numbers and talking about how they are\nprofitable for the month. Sandwiching the disclaimer between two \"incredible\nnews we're doing great!\" paragraphs leaves people with the impression\nthat...you're doing great. Which is exactly what has happened with all of the\nposts like this, the userbase's takeaway was \"sounds like they're doing\ngreat!\" when they've never been doing great.\n\nAnyway, for the math: we know from prior months that Cohost's expenses have an\naverage of roughly $20k a month. Sometimes they are more or less because\nbusinesses have expenses that aren't exactly monthly (like hosting, or legal\nfees, or buying more or less paperclips or whatever). But $20k is close.\nHowever, Cohost's MRR minus $20k is nowhere near breaking even, it's about\ntwice what it would need to be to make sense. The reason is, if you are just\nlooking at \"what we had to use from our bank accounts\", this is including\nyearly subs in their entirety. But MRR only includes 1/12 of the yearly subs,\nto account for the fact that they won't see that money again for a year. But,\nthey have that money to put in their bank account right now. To me, this is a\nform of double dipping, it doesn't necessarily mean that you are putting the\nnumbers in there twice in the books, but in terms of how you're presenting the\nnumbers to your userbase, you're both including them in the MRR, and including\nthem in a final sum that makes the last number sound better than it is. If you\nwere new to the site and had no idea what Cohost's monthly expenses looked\nlike, you'd just read \"we're profitable finally\" and not think much more about\nit. I think omitting expenses from these early reports is fairly egregious in\nterms of not showing the big picture. We should be looking at revenue,\nexpenses and net income, not money in the bank and here's how much we lost\ntotal. There's no reason we can't see a breakdown of MRR versus other income.\n\nAnyway we don't know their expenses, so I'm putting down $20,000. My first\ninstinct was to use their -$1,000 figure for net income, but then I realized\nthat if I did that, then in future math when I utilize MRR, I'd be counting\nthe yearly subs twice. So it only makes sense to utilize the standard\nequation, as people who can see into the future past this specific report, and\ngive ourselves -$11,351.52.\n\nCohost was expecting to end the year with $22,500 in the bank, but are now\nexpecting to end the year with $54,000 in the bank. This, they claim, gives\nthem \"incredible buffer and means [they] likely won\u2019t need as much funding\noverall.\" This is an absolutely incredible claim to me, given that they are\nabout to hire someone for another $87k (and later more) yearly. They know that\nthe sudden surge in subscribers is due to the Twitter surge, they can't\npossibly be expecting that to happen repeatedly. Even more troublesome to me\nis this comment:\n\n> \"our MRR is enough that employee #4 is effectively free for us\"\n\nTheir MRR is not even covering half the expenses they have now, and again,\nthis is an unusually high MRR for them. I have absolutely no idea how they've\ncome to this conclusion. Like, none. I can't even speculate at what they meant\nby this but it's so clearly not true that it baffles me.\n\nBefore this one signs off, they give their bad news, which is that they can't\nkeep up with support requests, hence their decision to hire for a full time\ncustomer support/moderation role. They also still say they are working on user\ntipping and subscriptions. They're going to say this a lot of times.\n\nCohost's Possible Debt value: $603,063.52\n\n## December 2022 Update\n\nDecember 2022 Update Link\n\nKaara has been hired on, so Cohost is now at 4 full time staff. Obviously\nthat's a big hit financially. Jess has also been working as as contractor\nduring this time, and this should be her last month of getting paid.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the big spike of people leaving Twitter has dwindled, and\ntheir 111k users from last month are only up to 118k now. Also, MAU is down\nfrom 37,000 last month to 21,000 this month. Unsurprisingly when there's a big\nwave of new people to a site, a lot of them fall off of it quickly because\nit's not their thing. Not a unique problem to Cohost.\n\nSubscribers are at 2027, which is up, which means so is MRR at $9,440. They\nhave ended the year with $59,000 in the bank, but this month's losses were\n$29,000, due to CDN costs. They mention that they were getting a \"sweet deal\"\non CDN services but will be paying closer to market rates as they move away\nfrom Cloudflare for ethical reasons. Since this next detail was in a personal\npost on Jae's account in March of 2023 and not a staff post, I might as well\ndiscuss their \"sweet deal\" here:\n\n> \"three-ish years ago, i complained on twitter about how cloudflare locked\n> wildcard subdomain support behind their enterprise plan and we were looking\n> for alternatives. a VP at cloudflare running their Startup Outreach program\n> DM'd me offering to set us up with a free enterprise contract. this was\n> supposed to last a year.\n\n> they completely forgot they did this and never followed up. we have paid\n> cloudflare a grand total of $50 since then. i never said anything because it\n> was a ticking time bomb; if they noticed and came calling, we'd be kind of\n> boned. but they didn't, and now we're off them completely, so it doesn't\n> fuckin matter! rest easy knowing your posting cost cloudflare money.\"\n\nThis post absolutely baffled me. First of all, it means that going forward\nCohost is going to be spending a lot more money, and that their expenses\nlooked a lot more reasonable than they were due to a literal fluke. But also,\nposting about this at all is bizarre to me. It's unprofessional for one thing,\nbut it's also not impossible for Cloudflare to have asked for their money.\nMaking a billing mistake doesn't mean the money is no longer owed. I would\nsimply not have posted about this!\n\nBack to the numbers...they lost a bit over $29,000, so that's our net income,\nwhich fits perfectly with our usual math to give us -$19,560 for expenses,\nhitting our typical \"close to $20k\" number. Actually kind of weird to frame\nthis as an unusual amount given that it's pretty much bog standard expenses\nfor them.\n\nThey are supposedly very close to securing \"bridge funding\", which...luckily\nthe Twitter influx did not necessitate needing this funding any sooner. They\nalso said they are expecting a \"roughly 7.5% COL adjustment to keep up with\ninflation\" next month. It is a company policy of ASSC that every year salaries\nwill be adjusted for inflation. I find this to be pretty unrealistic for a\ncompany that is still working on just breaking even.\n\nCohost promises to launch gift subscriptions and pay-what-you-want-\nsubscriptions (in this case referring to Cohost Plus, not the user\nsubscriptions that are paired with tipping). They plan to start working\ntipping and subscriptions Q1 2023, targeting a Q2 2023 release. Okay then!\n\nCohost's Possible Debt value: $632,063.52\n\n## H1 2023 Financial Update (Pre-Show)\n\nThis post is already way longer than anyone should want to read, and the sad\ntruth of it is, most of what came before now is just preamble to get to this\nupdate.\n\nYou may notice that this update is not January 2023. Or February 2023. Or\nMarch 2023. Or...well, anyway, it was posted on June 15th. And I'm sorry to\nsay, I didn't skip any updates.\n\nI decided to do something extremely tedious and stupid because nobody else\nshould need or want to do this--I decided to look at all of the weekly updates\nfrom Februrary 2023 to the start of June 2023 to see what mention there was of\nthe financial updates. It starts in the vol 48 update (Cohost labels its patch\nnotes with volume numbers which makes referring to them in this context a lot\neasier) on February 1st:\n\n> \"financial update will be a bit late this month; we\u2019re 99% done with this\n> funding round, but want to be 100% before we publish the new numbers. also\n> jae has been largely out sick all week and they\u2019re the one who writes\n> those.\"\n\nOkay, that's fine. You don't necessarily have to have January's update out on\nFebruary 1st, that's reasonable.\n\nThe vol. 49 update on Feb. 8 does not mention the financial update at all.\n(Though a side note--I mentioned earlier Jess's contract should have been\nover, but apparently Jess left this week, meaning they paid her for an extra\nmonth and change...so much for her contract being a \"maximum\" of however much\nmoney it was)\n\nThe vol. 50 update on Feb. 15 has the following note from Jae: \"i just\nremembered that i forgot to write the january financial update. whoops. gonna\nget that out soon.\" Also it does say they finalized their funding round, but\nonly chose to fund the first 6 months (of the year? Even though it's February\nalready? Unclear.) from their same one funder because their growth has been so\n\"spiky\" lately.\n\nThe vol. 51 update on Feb. 22 does not mention the financial update.\n\nThe vol. 52 update on Mar. 1 does not mention the financial update. Worth\nnoting that some of these updates list what each member is working on for the\nweek, which to me is far too granular a detail for public facing reports, but\nnotably the financial update isn't on anyone's plate in these.\n\nThe vol. 53 update on Mar 9 says the new financial update should be out\n\"tomorrow\", and was delayed because Jae has \"been having serious difficulty\nwith their chronic hand pain lately.\" Note that at this point, there should be\ntwo updates, for February and March.\n\nThe vol. 54 update on Mar 15 does not mention the financial update, despite\nthe fact that we were supposedly going to see it on Mar 10.\n\nThe vol. 55 update on Mar. 23 has an apology for the delay in updates: \"i\n(jae) have to redo budget math as part of our operating expense changes\n(fortunately, contracts mean fixed expenses) so the next financial update will\ninclude correct data based on that. unfortunately my health issues have\ncontinued largely unabated so i\u2019m behind on some things, but i\u2019m starting to\ncatch up again.\" Worth noting that this post also begs users to sign up for\nCohost Plus given that they have moved CDNs to one they actually have to pay\nfor.\n\nThe vol. 56 update...does this one even exist? If it existed I cannot find it.\nMaybe their April Fools post was meant to be taken as this one.\n\nThe vol. 57 update on Apr. 6 does not mention the financial update. At this\npoint we are missing three months of updates.\n\nThe vol. 58 update on Apr. 13 does not mention the financial update.\n\nThe vol. 59 update on Apr. 20 does not mention the financial update.\n\nThe vol. 60 update on Apr. 27 does not mention the financial update.\n\nThe vol. 61 update on May 5 does not mention the financial update. We're now\nmissing four months of updates.\n\nThe vol. 62 update on May 10 does not mention the financial update. I should\nprobably be saying updates at this point tbh but oh well.\n\nThe vol. 63 update on May 19 does not mention the financial update. There are\nsome mentions of the community guidelines updates coming soon, which is\nanother story for another time but is also about something Cohost kept saying\nwas coming soon but took a ridiculous number of months.\n\nAt this point we won't even see another weekly patch notes update until vol.\n64 on Jun 26, which is yet another example of not so timely updating. But, on\nJune 15th, we receive the \"H1 2023 Financial Update\".\n\nBefore we go into it, I just want to recap what we saw here...staff kept\npromising financial updates, then would go silent on them for weeks, then\nwould mention them as like JUST about to go out the door, then they would go\nsilent on them. And I can't stress enough, users were asking about this. Users\nwere asking where the updates were and largely getting no answers. I\nunderstand people get sick, but this many months of getting nothing, not even\na \"sorry still sick hopefully soon\", is just...incredible.\n\nAnd on a similar note, now might be a good time to bring up a running theme in\nCohost's user-facing staff updates that has been an issue for me since the\nbeginning. I believe the staff of this website way, way, way overshares on\ntheir personal lives. And I believe doing so has, intentionally or not, pushed\na severe parasocial angle between the staff and the users of the site. Maybe\nthis was fine when the users of the site were largely friends of the dev team,\nbut at this point Cohost has tens of thousands of users. It isn't really in\nanyone's best interest to get them too involved with the day to day of your\npersonal lives. Not only are the parasocial attachments unhealthy for the\npeople who have them, but they can end up flat out dangerous for the people\nthey're targeted at. I also think that the fact that not only the financial\nupdate but the patch notes as well occasionally have the excuse of \"we forgot\nto do them\" is frankly laughable and a sign of nonexistant management.\n\nAnyway, on to the update we waited five months for.\n\n## H1 2023 Financial Update (The Update)\n\nH1 2023 Financial Update Link\n\nThe H1 update starts with some excuses:\n\n> first off: where have we been? why has this financial update taken so long\n> to come out?\n\n> 2023 has been kind of a mess for us thus far. I was unfortunately kind of a\n> non-entity due to health issues (complications from long covid) during the\n> entirety of Q1, meaning that all work I had planned (including revenue-\n> generating work) was automatically delayed. I\u2019m currently the only one who\n> writes these, which means that if I forget or am unable, it doesn\u2019t happen.\n> (we\u2019re working on fixing this part.) I realize this is kind of a non-answer\n> but it\u2019s the truth. I have a bad working memory so sometimes I forget\n> things, like that I need to write the financial update. fellow ADHD-havers\n> will probably understand.\n\nI understand people have health issues, but again, this is a combination of\noversharing personal details and extreme mismanagement. Even with a team this\nsmall, you have got to have a backup plan if someone is out of commission.\nMore than one person needs to be able to do these reports. And as of the time\nI am writing this, there's still not a backup person to write these reports.\n\nAlso, as a \"fellow ADHD-haver\", I absolutely do not understand. Because I do\nnot work a job where I can just not do a report for 5 months. I do not work a\njob where I can just ghost people on reports I was supposed to have done. And\nI work a job where I am not literally the person in charge. Having ADHD makes\ndoing this kind of shit very hard, I'm sure I've missed a deadline or two\nbecause of ADHD, but for this many months, no, I don't understand, because\nonly someone who has no accountability for something can get away with just\nnot doing it for this long. I don't have a choice in my work to not do tasks\nfor five months, and I even have a really lenient company. ADHD-havers still\nhave shit they have to get done, I can't just forget to do my job.\n\nUnfortunately, the H1 report is...going to fuck up the ability to really chart\nthe monthly numbers. A lot of stuff is going to be glossed over and lumped\ntogether here. This update is the biggest reason I started with a disclaimer\nsaying that we were going to have to just wing it with a lot of the numbers.\nWe'll do what we can here.\n\nFirst off, Cohost salaries are now $94,616 from the cost of living adjustment,\nas of Feb. 15th. Payroll expenses are now $36,000 per month, and that's just\nsalary, taxes, health insurance kinda stuff, not other expenses.\n\nMoving to Fastly means that now they also have $4,850 per month of Fastly\ncosts.\n\nThey refer to the rest as \"the remaining $4,000ish of expenses\", for servers,\nstorage, and \"occasional legal/professional services\". So we can say that\ntheir monthly expenses are about $44,850, which is a significant amount more\nthan they used to be. We're used to seeing about $20k here. With a lack of\nother data, we are going to use this number for expenses for January through\nMay.\n\nOn to the other numbers...as it turns out, despite calling this the H1 report,\nthis is basically just the May report. Surprise!\n\nIn May, they had a revenue of $5,300, giving them a net income of -$41,000,\nwhich they infamously followed up by saying \"ideally, we would like to lose\nless money.\" This means their expenses were probably a little off from the\n$44,850 we got earlier, but these do fluctuate so I'll overlook the roughly\n$1k that I'm missing here. Instead for the month of May I'll change this\nnumber to -$46,300 to give us $41k in losses. Now, it's also worth noting, I\nhave no idea if \"revenue\" here means MRR, or just all revenue including yearly\nsubs and merch. I'd hope not, but we don't know.\n\nHowever, the next paragraph gets problematic. Now, Cohost is listing its\nnumbers as such, \"approximate and accurate as of June 14, 2023\" These numbers\nare total users 130,000, MAU 12,000, subscriptions 1,900 and MRR $9,008.\nExcept...what time span is this for?? Our revenue for May was $5,300, so is\n$9,008 for June? But this was posted on June 15th, so we shouldn't be talking\nabout June MRR yet. Honestly none of the numbers in this section should be\nwhat we're talking about, we haven't even touched anything previous to May and\nJune is only half done!\n\nThe \"half of June\" numbers also contain this caveat:\n\n> \"this is a larger number than our revenue this month because it amortizes\n> yearly subscriptions across the entire year, which isn\u2019t how that works in\n> real life but makes it a useful metric for Overall Business Health.\"\n\n> \"a lot of our annual subscribers subscribed in June and November, so revenue\n> in those months will look better than average; the other 10 months will look\n> worse.\"\n\nBeyond this, we are told that it is time for hard conversations, because the\nnumbers have stagnated compared to six months ago (even though we have no idea\nwhat happened between those two months).\n\nThis is the update that drops a bombshell that may sound eerily familiar for\nthose only now paying attention to Cohost's finances: \"at our current burn\nrate and bank balance, we will not make July 15 payroll.\" You may remember\nthat Cohost said that funding was secured for the first six months (which I\nhave to assume means \"of the year\" despite being solidified in February). So\nas of the time this was posted, Cohost has no funding prepared for running out\nof money in 1 month.\n\n> \"don\u2019t panic, we\u2019re not on the verge of collapse; we\u2019re raising additional\n> funding to help carry us through the year. our most recent funding round has\n> lasted us as long as we expected.\"\n\nThis seems a bit late to me to start raising funding when you are so close to\nnot making payroll, especially when finalizing the deal for the previous\nfunding seemed to take them at least 2 months. It also seems a bit late if you\nconsider the possibility that they don't get funding, since your users may\nwant to start backing up posts and whatnot just in case.\n\nThere's a bit of talk here about sustainability. The tl;dr is that Cohost\nwould need five times the number of subscriptions they have to be sustainable,\nand more active users than they have total users now. Their plan for making\nmore money, since \"infinitely getting more users\" won't happen, is user\nsubscriptions, i.e. the tipping and subscriptions mentioned before, that they\nsaid they planned to launch Q2 of 2023 (at this point in the story they are\nabout two weeks away from Q3). I think it's worth mentioning their plan here:\nthey intend to launch subscriptions with a 5% platform fee that they hope to\nlower if and when they become sustainable. They say they would need process\n$820,000 worth of subscriptions a month to account for the $41k they are\nlosing. With 12,000 active users, how many of those users do you think post\ncontent that someone would pay money to subscribe to? Then how many of those\nusers do you think would in fact subscribe to other users content?\n\nInterestingly, they make a note that despite moving 100 times the amount of\nmoney around that Cohost needs, Patreon is not profitable. Cool. They also\nthen go on to say \"it's hard to bank on this as our Primary Revenue Strategy\".\nAlso cool. I'm sure there's no reason to keep this in mind for later.\n\nThey go on to talk about tipping, which they see as a pre-req for\nsubscriptions. Jae calls this \"my main priority once asks are live\". This has\nalways been a sticking point for me, you know that you are one week from not\nmaking payroll, you have known you were in a bad financial state for months\nnow, yet your priority has and still is shipping an entirely monetized feature\nover shipping one that you at least thought at one point would only take one\nquarter to implement? Why on earth would you be worrying about shipping\ntumblr-style ask boxes when you can't get paid next month? Like everything\nelse, asks took them way longer than intended to finish. On top of this, their\nplan is to take a 0% cut of tips. So tips also will not make any money, and\nare just kind of a trial run before subscriptions get implemented to make\nmoney. But asks are the priority still, with one month before not making\npayroll.\n\nThe update then goes on to talk about how social media on the whole is not\nprofitable. Which is true and something I have said about ten thousand times\nduring Cohost's lifetime. None of them make money. Big, small, doesn't matter.\nThe only sustainable social media is social media run by hobbyists on a\nhobbyist budget, i.e. a forum or a fedi instance where nobody is pulling a\nsalary from doing it. As a corporate entity that is trying to pay people,\nsocial media is pretty much universally a bad idea. Cohost doesn't really have\na point here in talking about it, as they go on to ask Is There a Road to\nSustainability? great question! no idea!\n\nThey go through a few options, like user supported ads or promoted posts, then\nalso suggest an option for them is to pivot to something else entirely. But\nthey don't have any real ideas about that, and don't think they have the\ncapital to do that anyway. Their final idea is \"fake it 'til you make it (more\nfunding rounds)\", which in hindsight we know is the path they took.\n\n> \"our funder is one person. while we\u2019ve been cagey in the past identifying\n> them, that\u2019s solely because they like their privacy; it\u2019s not a big secret,\n> it\u2019s just not relevant. they are not a billionaire, they do not have\n> infinite money, they can not (and should not) fund us forever.\"\n\n> \"our current funding is in the form of interest-bearing bonds; these are\n> debt that need to be paid back. every time we do a new funding round, we\n> take on more debt. the fewer rounds the better.\"\n\nThey suggest a possibily of opening up to other funders, but don't expect to\nfind anyone that will fund their nonprofitable business. This is also where\nthey reveal for the first time I'm aware of on this scale (they had mentioned\nit to people in places like personal account Twitter replies in the past) that\nthe reason they will struggle to find other funders is because the collateral\nfor their loans is the \"ownership of ASSC's IP rights (at this point that is\nexclusively cohost's source code)\", which obviously they cannot offer to more\nthan one person, and they have little else to offer as collateral.\n\nThere's a section about burnout, which leads into a section where Jae talks\nabout being \"depressed, stressed out, and have been for a while now\". Again, I\nthink this is getting into overly personal territory feeding into the\nparasocial angle here. Even worse in a footnote we have a note from Jae about\nburning all of their savings to move to Florida, and being stressed out about\nnot being able to afford to move again. Again, sorry about the situation\nyou're in but this is extremely bad to have in your financial update for your\nbusiness. Don't put this here! Why do you have two footnotes about your unwise\ndecision to move to Florida? That's absurd to throw at your tens of thousands\nof users on a website you run as your job! There's also a footnote from the\nburnout section that links to Jae saying they've come very close to resigning\n--again, don't put this in your company's financial report!\n\nFrankly, I think, whether intentional or subconscious or accidental, the only\nthing the personal details serve to do is manipulate users into giving them\nmore money. I can't say whether this is malicious, but the outcome is the same\nno matter what the motivation was. By talking about how hard it is and how\nupset you are and how much you can't lose this job, Cohost will receive an\noutpouring of one time financial boosts from this post (particularly in the\nform of \"donations\", but as Cohost has no donation button, what this looks\nlike is people buying extra copies of Cohost Plus for themselves).\n\nWe've ended this update with...a lot of missing data about earlier in the\nyear, some extremely over personal depression posting, and an indication that\nCohost is out of money soon with the only strong plan for fixing that in the\nnext month being more funding. Keep that in mind when we get to the present\nday.\n\nHaving no idea what the revenue for Jan-Apr consists of, I'm choosing to just\nuse May's -$41,000 figure for all of these months. Might as well.\n\nCohost's Possible Debt value: $837,063.52 (just going to end of May here,\nbecause well, you'll see for June)\n\n## June 2023 Update\n\nJune 2023 Update Link\n\nThis update is a bit confusing, given that we already had a...half...June\nupdate. So I guess really this update isn't the confusing one, just the\ndecision to toss June into the previous one. This update was posted on July\n11th, which was only a few days before Cohost was expected to not make\npayroll. Cohost has seen a bump in revenue, due to the fears of shutting down\ndriving more subscriptions and donations, as well as another wave of folks\nleaving Twitter over Elon making them angry.\n\nThis time, the financial update has an actual chart. If you've just been\nlooking at my words and not clicking the links, the updates have all been just\nparagraphs about the numbers up until now. Now we have a chart! Which would be\nfantastic, except the new format has one of the biggest problems that would go\non to plague their financial updates until the present day--Cohost has now\ndecided to bizarrely structure their updates from roughly halfway through the\nmonth to roughly halfway through the month. And by roughly I mean not even on\na consistent basis from month to month. This update covers from June 15th to\nthe day it was posted, July 11th.\n\nHonestly, the only reason I can come up for for structuring the updates this\nway instead of just covering (mostly) a single month on its own is...not\ngreat. The only excuse I can think of for doing this is to try to fudge the\nnumbers to look better. Maybe you can hide some expenses on a bad month. Maybe\nyou can even hide a payroll week somewhere. Now, of course, it's easy to say\n\"well, it would just show up on the next month's report then!\" But...well,\nyou'll see. Regardless the decision to do this is going to fuck up our numbers\nagain. I am just going to try to put these numbers down for whatever month\nthey label the report for. I don't know what else to do with them at this\npoint otherwise.\n\nThere is one more consequence of the way they have decided to format the new\nreports. Now, we have no direct comparison between last month's (or half\nmonths combined, whatever) expenses and net income and today's. These are\nlisted as n/a. We do however get to see last month's revenue. Again, this\nfeels like a move made to start hiding bad numbers, otherwise I do not know\nwhy you would do this. You can compare literally any two numbers in this\nexcept for expenses and net income.\n\nAnd speaking of comparing numbers, let's do that. For some reason now we have\n\"previous month revenue\". This really confused me. At first I thought it was\njust showing the revenue of the period indicated, so on the left 6/15-7/11 and\nnext to that...some date to 6/15. But that seems weird to phrase the way we\nhave it. So I thought maybe it literally was the previous month's revenue, so\n$31.5k would be for some date to 6/15, but then...$4.4k would be for May, and\nwe know May's number and it isn't that.\n\nSo I am just choosing to not even deal with this one, the point seems to be\nanyway that they got a ton of donation money and that's why it went from $4.4k\nto $31.5k.\n\nNext are our expenses, which we don't get to compare at all! But right now as\nof halfway through July they are $26,500. My guess is that this includes the\nFastly costs, so I'd expect the total for July, counting by full months like\nanyone reasonable would, would be similar to the $44-46k we saw in the\nprevious months. But I don't know that. Net income is $5,000, which I guess\nmakes sense for the previous month revenue being $31,500, so maybe we do need\nto just assume this is the current month's revenue. Or half month's revenue. I\ngive up honestly on this distinction, our math is about to get arbitrary since\nit will only have to get even more aribtrary soon for other reasons.\n\nSubscribers have gone up from 1900 to 2531, which hopefully is not counting\nmultiple subscriptions bought by donations as different subscribing users,\nsince it's not described as \"subscriptions\". MRR is listed as $14,000, which\nis up quite a bit from $9,000 due to the two big factors mentioned earlier.\nMAU is 22,400 up from 12,000, this part only being affected by the second\nTwitter exodus.\n\nA really concerning bit to me in this is that Cohost has not closed additional\nfunding yet. They are four days away from not making payroll. It sounds like\nthe sudden push for donations has made this safe, but it's extremely worrying\nthat they only scraped through because enough people threw money at them. Not\nexactly the most secure strategy for not being broke.\n\nWork on tipping is just now starting, because Tumblr style asks finally\nshipped. This update is being billed as \"things are looking better\", but...has\nanything actually really changed about Cohost's situation here?\n\nI don't actually want to do a debt update on this one because...well...we\nalready included some of June, and we have part of July, and while we seem to\nbe $5,000 up we have the rest of July still to look at and...the debt update\nis going to become a problem from here anyway. Here we go!\n\n## Insert Financial Updates Here\n\nYou might have thought with the backlog of financial updates cleared (even\nthough we didn't REALLY get updates for most of those months), and getting a\nsecond one a little too soon, that the pressure would be off a little and we'd\nbe back to regular monthly updates. But we aren't! Once again as financial\nupdates get delayed and ignored, Cohost users ask where they are, typically\nwith no answer. Let's go through the patch notes, see if you can guess how\nlong they'll go on for, if you didn't cheat looking at the table of contents.\n\nTechnically the update that goes to July 11th was June's financial update, so\nI will start from vol. 69 on August 2nd, which is the first one post-July.\n\nThe vol. 69 update on Aug. 2 says \"new financial update coming this week\nprobably\". Sounds good, that would be very timely.\n\nThe vol. 70 update on Aug. 9 does not mention the financial update.\n\nThe vol. 71 update on Aug. 17 does not mention the financial update.\n\nThe vol. 72 update on Aug 24 does not mention the financial update.\n\nThe vol. 73 update on Aug 30 does not mention the financial update.\n\nThe vol. 74 update on Sept 14 does not mention the financial update. We now\nhave two months on the list (real months I'm not doing the weird half month\nshit).\n\nThe vol. 75 update on Sept 20 does not mention the financial update.\n\nThe vol. 76 update on Sept 28 says that they will have a full financial update\nout next week for the start of October (that would presumably include July,\nAugust and September), and that they have finalized their most recent round of\nfunding, meaning that between July 15th when they thought they were not going\nto make payroll and September 28th, they were...I guess running on fumes.\nSeems extremely late.\n\nOn Oct 10 they promote their new campaign with Makeship to produce eggbug\nplushes. Worth mentioning since it'll come up in later financial updates.\n\nThe vol. 77 update on Oct 13, which is definitely not the start of October or\n\"next week\", says \"jae is still putting together a financial update and is\nplanning to have it out Monday or Tuesday; their week has been impacted by a\ncovid case in the house so it\u2019s a bit delayed.\"\n\nThe vol. 78 update on Oct 20 (a Friday if you'd like to know), says \"we\u2019d\nhoped to have the new financial update out by now but Things Came Up, as they\noften do; jae\u2019s going to be training aidan on how to write them once she\u2019s\nback so that we\u2019ve got redundancy here. should be done next week!\". The idea\nof Aidan writing them sounds pretty good considering Jae clearly has their\nhands full and Aidan is the site's art person so probably has a less full\nplate than the coders do at this point.\n\nThe vol. 79 update on Nov 2 does not mention the financial update. October can\nnow be considered a month that is due.\n\nThe vol. 80 update on Nov 8 does not mention the financial update.\n\nThere aren't any more patch note updates (though there should have been)\nbefore we get to our next financial update...the November 2023 update! I was\nextremely upset by this because I spent the four missing months of updates\nplacing my bets on January. I got closer than I should have though.\n\n## November 2023 Update\n\nNovember 2023 Update Link\n\nThis update is actually \"November 2023 Financial Update + Tipping Launch\nPlans\". Remember tipping?\n\n> \"hi folks! jae here, we know it's been a bit since the last financial update\n> but there's been a lot going on behind the scenes that has made getting one\n> out before now difficult. I don't want to get too deep into it, so I won't.\"\n\nCryptic thing to say but we have a chart with numbers.\n\nSee, a problem we have here is that we can't actually compare these numbers\nwith much. Because there's several months of updates missing, and this is for\nNovember. Cohost has decided that it isn't important to cover the months that\nthey didn't get around to.\n\nThe revenue for November is $33,453, as of 11/20 (again, not doing months\nanymore). This is up from $9,348 \"as of 10/24\", so from some date to 10/24.\nRemember the revenue numbers here because I want to come back to this.\nExpenses are $39,574, but we again have n/a for the previous month's expenses\nin this new format. So...no fucking idea! Same for net income, but net income\nfor the current random chunk of time is -$6,121. Woof. The new standard for\nexpenses in 2023 with the new hire and cost of living change seems to be close\nto $44k (particularly before we started doing the weird half month thing),\nso...if we do the math with the previous sort-of-month's revenue, that would\nbe -$34,652. -$6k looks nice in comparison.\n\nSubscribers are down a bit, 2,682 to 2,576, MRR went from $14,748 to 14,367\nwhich isn't too bad of a change. The user numbers get weird though--they are\nall calculated \"as of 11/9\". You see...they lost the numbers. Nevermind that\nthis is something they should be able to pull again, but they lost October's\nnumbers entirely for this. Well, from 11/9 to 11/20 MAU, which is all we care\nabout really, went from 18,446 to 21,142.\n\nThe post starts with a caveat that this is one of the largest subscription\nrenewal periods. Since so many people joined during the late 2022 Twitter\nexodus, yearly subs are popping up again. This means that nice big number in\nrevenue that does not seem to get them into a positive amount of income at the\nend. Cohost saw a little bump of growth from Tumblr users getting mad at\nTumblr and leaving, joining Cohost.\n\nDespite the fact that they had a big bump of yearly money and still didn't\nbreak even for the month, they describe this as \"the social media part of the\nbusiness is healthy\". They seem to be differentiating the tipping/subscription\npart of the site from the social media part of the site, as if it's a pivot to\na different business, despite them saying originally that they didn't expect\ntipping and subscriptions to be all that profitable either. But now they are\ndescribing them as \"major revenue drivers going forward\". I mean, I guess this\nis true when you are comparing it to \"no further growth from Cohost Plus\" and\n\"a one time plush preorder\" and \"nothing\".\n\nTheir current round of funding they secured is supposed to give them runway\nthrough to \"around the end of Q1 2024\", which is March (which is when I am\nwriting this).\n\nThey say they will unfortunately \"miss [their] internal deadline for tipping\"\nand will hold off its release until early 2024. Given that their last internal\ndeadline from tipping they told us in the December 2022 update was Q2 2023,\nthey already long missed it. They also talk about how tipping will have to be\nrestricted to US users at launch, but non-US users will be included \"shortly\nafter launch\". PayPal will not be supported at launch. So the audience for the\nlaunch of tipping will be Americans who do not need to use PayPal who want to\ntip other users on Cohost. That cuts out quite a few people.\n\nSo, again, we're missing a bunch of months of data. Again, the data we do have\nis extremely hard to use. But I want to point out a pattern I am seeing at\nthis point. The H1 update was basically unavoidable for them, because they had\nto break the news that they were a month away from having no money and not\nmaking payroll. But then immediately, when that caused people to give them a\nton of money, they had an update like...TOO soon about that. Then...we get\ntotal silence until November, when again they have a big burst of revenue\n(while still losing money, it's a lot less than they were losing before). So\nit's at this point I want to just flat out say this: I truly believe that they\ndeliberately picked financial updates to push out when the numbers looked\ntheir best, then went silent again until they either had more decent numbers\nor were in such bad shape they couldn't avoid it anymore. Can I prove that?\nNo. Do I believe it? Absolutely. Because they seemed to be able to get updates\nout real snappy when the numbers were better than average. Otherwise we just\nseem to get them when things are so bad they can't put off telling people\nanymore. And I think the next update might highlight that as well.\n\nFor our debt update, I am going to have to just really play around here. We\nknow November's losses of -$6,121. We estimated October at -$34,652. I'm going\nto give the $5,000 positive value to July even though it's half-July and\ninside of June's update. For everything else I'm just going to copy what we\nhad from May 2023. That's what happens when you don't give me anything else to\nuse.\n\nCohost's Possible Debt value: $995,836.52\n\n## Yet Again\n\nSorry, did you think there would be a December 2023 update here? Weren't you\nhappy enough we gave you another update after so many months of not doing one?\nYou want one right after that???\n\nOnce again, people keep asking about the updates. Once again, they get ignored\nby staff. Once again, let's go through the patch notes posts.\n\nThe vol. 83 update on Jan 5 is the first where we could expect to see a\nDecember update. Kaara has been at ASSC for a year now and has the option per\ntheir guidelines to become a joint owner of the company and has decided to do\nso. But no mention of a financial update.\n\nThe vol. 84 update on Jan 12 does not mention the financial update.\n\nThe vol. 85 update on Jan 24 does not mention the financial update.\n\nThe vol. 86 update on Feb 2 does not mention the financial update. However,\nhere it is announced that Jae is abruptly moving out of Florida, and due to\nthis, Colin is going to take over tipping and subscriptions, but Jae's move is\ngoing to delay the transition for some unknown amount of time.\n\nThe vol. 87 update on Feb 14 does not mention the financial update. It does\nmention that tipping is being worked on.\n\nThe vol. 88 update on Feb 26 does not mention the financial update. This is\nalso around the time that a ton of new users left Tumblr and joined Cohost.\nJae is still moving.\n\nThe vol. 89 update on Mar 8 does not mention the financial update. Jae is done\nmoving, and Colin is \"moving over to tipping and subscriptions once he wraps\nup what he's currently working on\". This one threw me for a loop. If this is\nto be believed, then nobody has really been working on tipping so far all\nyear. Jae wasn't able to do it, which is why they were moving it to Colin in\nthe first place, but Colin hasn't actually moved over to it yet, and is\nworking on something else. I'm not sure what else on the site could be more\nimportant than their only plan for increasing revenue at the moment, but\ntipping seems like it wasn't worked on at all for Q1 2024, despite them making\nit sound like it was almost ready to launch right before the holidays.\n\nAnd this brings us to the big show, the thing that sparked this whole\nretrospective off.\n\n## March 2024 Update\n\nMarch 2024 Update Link\n\nThe March 2024 Financial Update is, frankly, a massive trainwreck. Though not\nreally an unprecedented one. It is essentially the H1 2023 update, except this\ntime with a wrinkle that makes it way, way worse.\n\nFirst of all, the March update isn't...really March exactly. We're doing half\nmonths still, and this is March 11th. The previous time period is being\ndesignated as February 13th. I have no idea how these dates are selected.\n\nBefore we dive in completely I want to point out this line:\n\n> \"we're at a point where we aren't going to get meaningfully more information\n> by continuing to wait to publish this.\"\n\nI'm not sure what additional information you expected to have after the time\nperiod of your data. None of the data these reports provide really have much\nof a lag time to them, so what exactly does this mean? What would continuing\nto wait have brought you in other circumstances?\n\nFrankly, my belief is that they held off on doing updates until they could do\none that included the revenue from the Eggbug Plush. Which this one does\ninclude, to the tune of a one time $10,000. The problem being that they would\nhave had to make this update by now anyway for reasons you'll soon hear.\n\nRevenue described as \"subscriptions only\" (is this monthly AND yearly, or just\nyearly? \"Previous revenue\" was never clear before anyway on that) is at\n$12,496, up from $8,369 on our last weird time period. This time, we actually\nget expenses and net income from the previous period, which makes me have to\nask why we didn't before. I'm going to call the previous period February since\nthey're calling this March. February had $32,643 in expenses, with a net\nincome of -$24,274. March had $34,328 in expenses with a net income of\n-$11,764 thanks to the eggbug plush money. MRR is staying stagnant at around\n$14k with $14,536 for March and $14,037 for February. Subscribers...you know\nwhat, I'm not even bothering with these amounts. We need to move on further in\nthis post to what matters at this point. I am however going to arbitrarily\naward December and January the average of the last two net incomes we have,\nwhich is -$18,019. I don't know if that's too generous or not.\n\nThe important details are as such: ASSC is still not profitable, payroll is\nthe main reason why, and they are still reliant on a single person for\nfunding.\n\nThere is a section on why tipping was so delayed, and it absolutely gets into\ntoo personal territory once again.\n\n> \"however, this meant that shipping eggbux on time was fully dependent on its\n> assigned developer (me) being able to work at a consistent, strong pace\n> through the entire process. this didn't happen.\"\n\n> \"to avoid going into too much detail: I am disabled and experienced related\n> health issues that prevented me from working at even half-pace for much of\n> the back-half of last year. this compounded with fear of failure, preventing\n> us from having the sort of difficult conversations needed to fully right the\n> ship. to be frank, the vibes internally have been rancid, and we weren\u2019t\n> able to start fixing this until early last month. all of this and more\n> combined to keep us from launching eggbux on time or, as of now, at all.\"\n\nAt this point, my questions are this: why are you running a business if you\ncan't have hard conversations with your business partners, and why has every\nsingle mission critical project been put on the shoulders of the employee who\nhas missed the most work and had the most illness? This isn't the first time\nthis has been a major issue, and nothing seemed to have been learned from\nthat. This is a failure to me of the entire team, as equal owners, because you\nhave to have these hard conversations and you have to manage your projects\nappropriately. Everyone fucked up here.\n\nNow, Cohost has enough money to get them to early April. This is about two to\nthree weeks from the time the update was posted. This is even less than the\nprevious \"we are about to not make payroll\" post. I find these to be extremely\nirresponsible, once the money is gone users have every reason to believe the\nsite can go away at any minute, and they absolutely deserve more of a heads up\nthat their data is at risk. Even though they say they have \"no reason to\nbelieve\" that closing the site is necessary, why should anyone believe that\nwhen they're about to be out of money? Websites cost money to run, and as we\nsee later, there's not much of a plan here to get more money.\n\nThere's a long section on their funding, it largely reiterates things we know\nabout the collateral and whatnot.\n\nBut the key part of this section is: they have no idea where their funder is.\n\nTheir only source of funding is missing. They can't contact them, and haven't\nbeen in contact with them for over a month. I have no idea if they have mutual\nfriends who could have contacted them, I have no idea if they've done any kind\nof wellness check, but what we know is that their funder and long time friend\nis totally missing, not possible to contact, and they aren't sure whether\nthey're even alive or dead. Unlike the last no-payroll scare, there isn't a\nquick solution to getting more money in the bank.\n\nHere, they outline their plans, which are absolutely worth talking through one\nby one. For some reason it starts with Plan B, even though I did not notice a\nPlan A anywhere. I'm going to number them instead.\n\nPlan 1 - \"Business as usual\". This plan would be better described as \"sit and\npray\". Their hope here is that they can contact their funder in the next 2-3\nweeks and get more money. But their funder is a friend who has ghosted them.\nBest case scenario (for them) is the funder got ill or went to jail or\nsomething that prevented them from contact and now they come back and are\nstill friends. In this case, however, are they really going to be ready to\ngive you a loan in the next couple of weeks? Otherwise, the funder is ghosting\nthem on purpose, or dead, and in these cases they aren't getting any more\nmoney from them. Given that they have such little time, this plan might as\nwell be called \"do nothing\".\n\nPlan 2 - \"Crowdfund\". This one is barely even worth mentioning, because this\nplan is \"crowdfund with our users\", but the entire section is about how it\nwouldn't be useful probably, they basically veto this one as they talk through\nit.\n\nPlan 3 - \"Kaara Gets Cohost\". They have the revenue to cover one paycheck, so\nthis plan is for them to spend their money on full time moderation, which\nwould be Kaara. The rest of them have to find new jobs. There wouldn't be any\nmore development on the site, which means no new sources of income, so this\nseems like an attempt to kick the can down the road in the hopes a different\nplan works out instead. They cannot attempt open sourcing the code to bring in\nvolunteers because the funder has their code as collateral, and they cannot\ncontact them.\n\nPlan 4 - \"Someone buys us\". This is honestly just another \"sit and pray\" plan\nbecause I am not aware of anyone offering to buy Cohost in the first place and\nthey only have a few weeks. Not to mention, they are going to need their\nfunder to be involved to sell as well.\n\nPlan 5 - \"Cohost shuts down\". This one is self explanatory. They talk about\nwriting data export tools and making static pages. But I don't know who is\ngoing to be doing this, and they don't seem like they're planning to code this\nin the next 2-3 weeks. With how dynamically rendered Cohost is (to a fairly\nannoying degree sometimes), I can't imagine just leaving the static pages up\nwould be trivial. It seems to me like the time to write export tools was\nmonths ago, or at least act like you're planning on doing it right now.\n\nThere's not much left after this. And unlike the previous can't-make-payroll\npost, there's no call to action.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFrankly, I think the Cohost team has given up. But I think they gave up way\nbefore this. Social media isn't profitable. But they've honestly never seemed\nto make much of an effort to make Cohost profitable. Tipping frequently got\nignored to make things like the alternate email-style feed view, or tumblr-\nstyle asks, or more \"fun\" features. They have a merch store but the link just\nexists in the staff account bio page, it's not in the footer or really ever\nadvertised anywhere except by other users. They have no donation link, you\njust have to be told by someone else that you can buy bonus subscriptions. And\nthey have a userbase that wants to give them money. I frequently see posts\nfrom people asking how they can donate, or wishing that they had a merch store\n(when they do). And even the simplest things like \"making the merch store\neasier to see\" haven't been done. And yet in the last financial\nupdate...they've given up. They know they don't have a second rich friend to\nkeep funding them, and they know they never had a path to really make\nthemselves sustainable.\n\n=> Return to Home\n\n", "frontpage": false}
