For you, the pain of\ngetting punched in the head is worth \u2013\u00a3100 a day.\n\nThen suppose you offered me a deal, to pay me \u00a32 a day to not punch you in the\nhead. Then suppose I counter offered with \u00a399 a day, and punched you in the\nhead again for food measure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrivacy Settings\n\n\u00a399 a day is most of the money you have, but being punched in the head really\nsucks, so you reluctantly agree to my terms.\n\nYou are now \u00a31 a day better off (+\u00a3100 value of not getting punched; \u2013\u00a399\nbribe money) And I am now \u00a398 better off (+\u00a399 bribe money, \u2013\u00a31 punching\nsatisfaction)\n\nIn this dumb story, we are now both better off because of this trade, so it is\na Pareto improvement. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s impossible to make either one of us\nbetter off without making the other one of us worse off. This is a Pareto\nefficient outcome \u2014 the one real metric for whether we consider a market to be\nefficient or not.\n\nThe point of this is to illustrate how Pareto efficiency and efficient markets\ndon\u2019t care about power dynamics, exploitation, or distributional outcomes.\n\nJust because a market is efficient and the outcome is Pareto efficient doesn\u2019t\nmean it\u2019s a good outcome. And Governments shouldn\u2019t only intervene when there\nis market failure in the technical sense, because then they would look at our\npunching-in-the-head scenario and conclude that there\u2019s no market failure\nhere.\n\nHere ends my Thursday afternoon economics parable :\u2013)\n\nThis post is brought to you by my eldest son, professional economist Daniel\nTaylor.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Facebook\n  * X\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### Related\n\nG.
