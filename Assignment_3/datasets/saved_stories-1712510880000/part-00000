Depending on what additional\ncontamination is found, the amount paid out will range from $10.5 billion to\n$12.5 billion.\n\nRELATED: Despite historic 3M PFAS payout, Minnesota communities need millions\nmore for cleanup\n\n\"This is yet another important step forward for 3M as we continue to deliver\non our priorities. The final approval of this settlement and continued\nprogress toward exiting all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025 will further\nour efforts to reduce risk and uncertainty as we move forward,\" 3M's chairman\nand CEO, Mike Roman, said in a news release.\n\nSix years ago, 3M settled with the state for $850 million for disposing the\nchemicals and contaminating drinking water and our environment \u2014 one of the\nlargest settlements of its kind in the country.\n\nThe deal compensates water providers for pollution with per- and\npolyfluorinated substances, known collectively as PFAS \u2014 a broad class of\nchemicals used in nonstick, water- and grease-resistant products such as\nclothing and cookware.\n\nPFAS have been described as \"forever chemicals\" because they don't degrade\nnaturally in the environment. They've been linked to a variety of health\nproblems, including liver and immune-system damage and some cancers.\n\nThe compounds have been detected at varying levels in drinking water\nnationwide. The Environmental Protection Agency in March 2023 proposed strict\nlimits on two common types, PFOA and PFOS, and said it wanted to regulate four\nothers. Water providers would be responsible for monitoring their systems for\nthe chemicals.\n\nRELATED: PFAS in Minnesota: How \"forever chemicals\" changed the state of water\n\nA new state law passed last year will ban PFAS in some consumer products\nstarting in 2025 with a full ban in 2032. But prevention is only one part of\nthe solution. Some communities like Woodbury and St. Louis County also want\nlawmakers to approve funding for PFAS mitigation in their infrastructure\npackage this year.\n\nThe 3M settlement first announced in June came in a lawsuit by Stuart,\nFlorida, one of about 300 communities that had filed similar suits against\ncompanies that produced firefighting foam or the PFAS it contained. The\npayment will help cover the costs of filtering PFAS from systems.\n\nSome of the settlement money will help additional water systems test for\ncontamination from PFAS, said Scott Summy, one of the lead attorneys for those\nsuing 3M and other manufacturers. They have until June 2026 to apply for\ncompensation if contamination is found.\n\n\"That's great news for American citizens who drink from that water,\" Summy\nsaid. \"It'll help rid our public drinking water systems of PFAS, and that's\nthe most important thing about the settlement.\"\n\n3M pledged in late 2022 that the company would stop manufacturing and using\nPFAS by the end of 2025.\n\n### More from CBS News\n\nDisabled, elderly worry about Uber, Lyft leaving as companies attempt to fill\nthe void\n\nSt. Paul school district proposes major budget cuts next year, including staff\nreductions and food menu changes\n\nWisconsin's bar association agrees to change diversity definition in\nsettlement\n\nMissing mother and son believed to be in Twin Cities, BCA says\n\nIn:\n\n  * Health\n  * Charleston\n  * Lawsuit\n\nWCCO Staff\n\nThe WCCO Staff is a group of experienced journalists who bring you the content\non WCCO.com.\n\nTwitter Facebook Instagram\n\nFirst published on April 1, 2024 / 5:28 PM CDT\n\n\u00a9 2024 CBS Interactive Inc.
