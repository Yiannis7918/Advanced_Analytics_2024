It presents a novel finding revealing that\nnight-migrating birds are at greater risk of colliding with buildings lit up\nwith high levels of blue light at night, a factor that has not been\nextensively studied before.\n\nThe Black-backed Kingfisher was one of the migrant bird species studied.\n\nThe phenomenon is global, but significant gaps exist in our understanding of\nbird-building collisions. In North America, where the vast majority of bird\ncollision studies have been conducted, between 365 million and 988 million are\nestimated to die from building collisions every year, mostly involving\nmigratory birds. According to the study, only a small number of studies have\nfocused on the tropics, especially the Asian and African tropics, and very\nlittle is known about where and why birds collide with buildings in these\nparts of the world.\n\nAdditionally, most studies of bird-building collisions have been based on\nsurveys conducted on a small handful of buildings, generally in city centers\nor university campuses. These studies suggest that bird-building collisions\nare connected to the ways buildings are designed, and that larger, glassier,\nand more light polluted buildings tend to kill more birds, but very little is\nknown about whether these factors apply across the entire breadth of large\ncities.\n\nTan, a Ph.D. candidate in Professor Michael Andersen\u2019s lab at the UNM\nDepartment of Biology, whose research focuses on the biogeography, evolution,\nand conservation of birds in Southeast Asia, led the research based in\nSingapore and studied the issue using a different approach than previous\nstudies.\n\nInstead of surveying just a small number of buildings in the city center, Tan\nand co-lead author Nicholas Freymueller collected community science\nobservations of dead birds from across the entire island of Singapore, a\ndensely populated city-state that\u2019s slightly smaller than New York City (734.3\nsquare kilometers/283.5 square miles), with over 100,000 buildings island-\nwide. With these observations, Tan and Freymueller used ecological niche\nmodeling \u2013 a method normally used to estimate where animals live \u2013 to instead\npredict where birds were most likely to die from building collisions, by\nreconstructing the \u201cdeath niche\u201d of the city\u2019s birds.\n\n> \"These results confirm what we previously suspected about pittas from bird\n> banding studies conducted in the 1960s \u2013 that pittas are strongly attracted\n> to light when they migrate at night.\" - UNM Ph.D. candidate David Tan\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a counterintuitive way to think about niche models,\u201d said Tan, \u201cBut if\nwe can use environmental factors like temperature and rainfall to predict\nwhere living animals occur, it makes sense that the same methods can also be\nused to predict where birds might die from building collisions since these\ncollisions are strongly affected by the urban environment.\u201d\n\nTogether with collaborators from the National University of Singapore\n(Singapore) and the Nanyang Technological University (Singapore), the\nresearchers compiled nearly 225 confirmed bird-building collision records from\n2013-2020, including migrant and resident species, and discovered several\nnotable findings, including that pittas accounted for the majority of\nmigratory bird collisions, while collision mortalities were dominated by\npigeons for the resident species.\n\n\u201cIn particular, we found that pittas, a group of colorful but secretive birds\nthat collide extremely frequently (i.e., \u201csupercolliders\u201d) with buildings\nacross South, East, and Southeast Asia, are particularly sensitive to blue\nlight pollution and that future shifts to white LED streetlights are likely to\nincrease the number of pitta collisions with buildings dramatically,\u201d said\nTan.\n\n\u201cThese results confirm what we previously suspected about pittas from bird\nbanding studies conducted in the 1960s \u2013 that pittas are strongly attracted to\nlight when they migrate at night \u2013 and this is the first time anyone has\ndemonstrated a specific attraction to blue light in this group of birds,\u201d Tan\nadded.\n\nPigeons, including the thick-billed green pigeon, were dominant among bird-\nbuilding collision mortalities for resident birds.\n\nAmong non-migratory birds such as the green pigeons and emerald doves, the\nresearchers also found that these species tend to collide with buildings near\nthe edges of forests, which may be due to the fact that these forest-dwelling\nspecies often move through cities as they transit between fragmented forest\npatches.\n\n\u201cOur results also show how forest-edge buildings, especially short buildings\nunder 20 meters in height, should be areas of high priority for deploying\nanti-collision measures,\u201d said Tan.\n\nBased on these findings, the scientists were able to identify several future\nresidential and industrial developments in Singapore that were likely to\nexperience high collision rates, mainly due to their proximity to forested\nareas and the high levels of blue light pollution emitted by LED streetlights.\n\n\u201cOne of the benefits of working in Singapore is that the government tends to\nplan everything well ahead of time,\u201d said Tan. \u201cBecause of this, we were able\nto use long-term land-use plans published by the Singapore government to\npredict where future collision hotspots might occur, which will in turn allow\nurban planners and developers to incorporate bird-friendly measures into\nbuilding designs even before the first foundations are laid.\u201d\n\nAs a possible solution, the scientists suggested that buildings in future\ncollision hotspots should incorporate collision-mitigation measures such as\nbird-safe glass into their fa\u00e7ades, which will make glass surfaces more\nvisible to birds and reduce the chance of collisions. Other glass shading\nmeasures such as mullions and louvers could also be incorporated into the way\nbuildings are clad in high-risk zones near forests, the scientists said.\n\nAnd as for the impact of blue light pollution, especially from white LED\nlights, the researchers were keen to stress that they were not opposed to the\nwidespread adoption of more energy-efficient LED lights, but added that\nshifting to warmer, more orange color tones and using shielding to minimize\nthe amount of light pollution spilling upwards into the sky might help reduce\nthe impact of nocturnal blue light pollution on migrating birds.\n\n\u201cOur discovery that blue light pollution increases the building collision risk\nof night-migrating birds in tropical Asia adds to the small but growing number\nof studies worldwide showing that blue light pollution attracts migratory\nbirds,\u201d said Tan, \u201cReducing blue light emissions at night during the migratory\nmonths could help reduce the number of bird deaths in cities, especially in\ntropical Asia.\u201d\n\nTags: Bird collisions\n\n## Related News\n\n### UNM Continuing Education v. middle school students; a case where everyone\nwins\n\n### UNM Esports takes over the NMSU Invitational\n\n### U.S. News & World Report releases 2024 Best Graduate Schools rankings\n\n### UNM's Anderson School welcomes Dean Alina Chircu\n\n## News Minute\n\n## Thanks for signing up!\n\nYou can unsubscribe at any time using the Unsubscribe link at the bottom of\nevery email.\n\n## Submit A Story\n\nDo you have a suggestion for a story that illustrates excellence at UNM?\n\nSubmit A Story\n\n# Academics\n\n  * Academic Calendars\n  * Class Schedule\n  * Colleges & Schools\n  * Course Catalog\n  * Degrees & Certificates\n  * Graduate Studies\n\n# Campus Life\n\n  * Arts & Entertainment\n  * Athletics\n  * Diversity\n  * Recreational Services\n  * Student Activities\n  * Student Union\n\n# Resources\n\n  * Bookstore\n  * Computing\n  * Continuing Education\n  * Employment\n  * Libraries\n  * UNM Newsroom\n\n# Information for...\n\n  * Alumni\n  * Faculty\n  * Parents & Families\n  * Patients\n  * Public Records - IPRA\n  * Staff\n\nAPPLY Now Visit UNM Give to UNM\n\n\u00a9 The University of New Mexico Albuquerque, NM 87131, (505) 277-0111 New\nMexico's Flagship University\n\n  * UNM on Facebook\n  * UNM on Instagram\n  * UNM on Twitter\n  * UNM on Tumblr\n  * UNM on YouTube\n\nmore at social.unm.edu\n\n  * Website Comments\n  * Accessibility\n  * Legal\n  * Contact UNM\n  * New Mexico Higher Education Dashboard\n\n## Thanks for signing up!\n\nYou can unsubscribe at any time using the Unsubscribe link at the bottom of\nevery email.\n\n## Thanks for signing up!\n\nYou can unsubscribe at any time using the Unsubscribe link at the bottom of\nevery email.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
