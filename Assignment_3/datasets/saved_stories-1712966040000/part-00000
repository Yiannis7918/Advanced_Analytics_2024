The Google One VPN service we\ncomplained about last week is headed to the chopping block. Google's support\ndocuments haven't been updated yet, but Android Authority reported on an email\ngoing out to Google One users informing them of the shutdown. 9to5Google also\ngot confirmation of the shutdown from Google.\n\nThe Google One VPN launched in 2020 as a bonus feature for paying Google One\nsubscribers. Google One is Google's cloud storage subscription plan that\nallows users to buy extra storage for Gmail, Drive, and Google Photos. In\n2020, the plan was exclusive to the expensive 2TB tier for $10 a month, but\nlater, it was brought down to all Google One tiers, including the entry-level\n$2-per-month option.\n\nBy our count, Google has three VPN products, though \"products\" might be too\nstrong a word since they are all essentially the same thing\u2014VPN market\nsegments? There's the general Google One VPN for Android, iOS, Windows, and\nMac\u2014this is the one that's dying. There's also the \"Pixel VPN by Google One,\"\nwhich came with Pixel phones (the \"Google One\" branding here makes no sense\nsince you didn't have to subscribe to Google One) and the Google Fi VPN that's\nexclusive to Google Fi Android and iOS customers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnlarge / The Google One VPN settings.\n\nGoogle\n\nThe Google One VPN that's shutting down was by far the most flexible, with the\nwidest platform support, and its shutdown represents Google ending VPN support\nfor Windows and Mac. The Pixel and Fi VPNs will keep running, possibly with\nnew branding.\n\nA Google spokesperson told 9to5Google the Google One VPN is shutting down\nbecause \"people simply weren\u2019t using it.\" The Windows client was also super\nbuggy, and it's probably easier to shut it down rather than fix it. There's no\nshutdown date yet, but a message on this page says the VPN will be phased out\n\"later in 2024.\"\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How The Callisto Protocol's Gameplay Was Perfected Months Before Release\n\n#### reader comments\n\n52\n\nRon Amadeo Ron is the Reviews Editor at Ars Technica, where he specializes in\nAndroid OS and Google products.
