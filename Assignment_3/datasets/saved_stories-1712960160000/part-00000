It\u2019s two guys who\ntravel all over the United States (and in a few cases, elsewhere too)\nexploring abandoned buildings, and recording both the exteriors and interiors\nfor posterity, since many of these buildings suffer from massive decay and are\noften slated for demolition. These buildings have histories and stories that\notherwise would be lost to time.\n\nThey are incredibly respectful of the buildings they explore, and they will\nnot break open locked doors or windows, and only traverse open and unlocked\ndoors or openings borne out of natural decay. They never take anything from\nthe sites they visit, and abhor what urban explorers call \u201cstaging\u201d, where you\nmove furniture and objects around to invoke or imply stories and things that\naren\u2019t there. Their videos are also very calm, muted, quiet, and only\noccasionally use atmospheric music for some of the more artistic shots. As a\nsidenote, they also happen to have the absolute best intro music of all time.\n\nOne of the things you quickly notice as you see these buildings, and explore\ntheir interiors, is just how solidly made and beautifully detailed they were.\nWhether they\u2019re exploring an 19th century Kirkbride mental asylum, an early\n19th century power plant, or a mid-20th century hospital \u2013 they all tend to be\nmade not just to serve a function, but also to be beautiful and solid, both\ninside and out. Walls, ceilings, and doorways are beautifully detailed in\nmasonry or woodwork, light fittings are solid and ornate, and even access\ncorridors or storage basements have gorgeous vaulted ceilings, decorated\nwalls, and ornate pillars.\n\nThe contrast to modern buildings couldn\u2019t be starker. Buildings and workplaces\nof today are littered with drop ceilings, flimsy dividers, open plans, endless\namounts of glass, all in styles so minimalist it just makes spaces feel cold,\nuninviting, and lacking in human scale. Modern buildings and interiors are\ntemporary, ephemeral, built not for humans, but to a bottom line and some\ndesigner\u2019s fancy \u2013 these old hospitals, factories, and even power plants are\npermanent, enduring, and made to human scale. They served as much as a status\nsymbol for whatever ruthless capitalist owned the building as they did as a\nplace for that same ruthless capitalist to extract wealth from mistreated\nworkers.\n\nThis juxtaposition, of the minimalist, soulless, flimsy and cheap-looking\nexteriors and interiors of modern buildings on the one hand, and the\nbeautifully detailed, skillfully crafted, and human-scale exteriors and\ninteriors from these older buildings on the other, is something that kept\ncreeping back into my mind during my use of the MNT Reform. This is a device\nbuilt by people who deeply care, who are very opinionated, and know exactly\nwhat they want to make \u2013 very much the opposite of the cookie-cutter dime-a-\ndozen laptops that flood the market today.\n\nMNT was so kind as to send me a Reform, at some risk to them because I am\ndefinitely not the kind of customer the Reform is typically aimed at. Yet,\nafter a few months of use, I can confidently say this is one of the most\nunique devices I\u2019ve ever used, and one that\u2019s worth every cent. Let\u2019s explore\nwhy.\n\n### Brutalist hardware\n\nLet\u2019s first dive into what, exactly, the Reform is. At its core, it\u2019s an ARM-\nbased laptop designed to run Linux, developed and built by a small team of\npeople in Berlin. The Reform is unique in that it is designed to be open\nhardware, fully repairable and highly modular and upgradeable. It consists of\na mainboard with an mPCIe slot, an M.2 slot for NVME SSDs, 16GB eMMC storage,\nand uniquely, a slot for a System-on-Chip module roughly the size of an SO-\nDIMM module that contains the processor and RAM. The keyboard and pointing\ndevice are internally connected through USB 2.0 and easily replaceable, too.\n\nThe Reform is defined as much by what it does not have as by what it does\nhave. You won\u2019t find any surveillance devices inside the Reform \u2013 no webcam,\nno microphones, nothing. There have been laptops with little privacy switches\nor sliding covers for the webcam, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen a modern laptop\nthat eschews cameras and microphones since the late \u201990s. It\u2019s one of the many\nexamples of the Reform\u2019s opinionated design choices.\n\nThe configuration MNT sent me consists of the aforementioned mainboard,\ncoupled with one of the processor modules they offer \u2013 in my case, the RCM4\nA311D, which sports four 2.2GHz Cortex-A73 cores and two 1.8GHz Cortex-A53\ncores, 4GB of LP-DDR4 RAM, and an ARM Mali G52 MP4 GPU that supports OpenGL/ES\n3.1 through Panfrost. This module also supports Wi-Fi 5 and Bluetooth 5.0\nthrough the integrated RTL8822CS.\n\nThe A311D is just one of many modules available for purchase for the Reform,\nand during the writing of this review, MNT also added a brand new SoC module\nto its lineup \u2013 the RK3588, the most powerful option available for the Reform.\nIt packs 4 ARM Cortex-A76 cores (up to 2.4GHz) and 4 ARM Cortex-A55 cores (up\nto 2.2GHz), 16GB or 32GB of RAM, and 128GB or 256GB of eMMC storage. It also\nsports an ARM Mali-G610 MP4 4-core GPU.\n\nLike with all other modules, the drivers for the A311D in my model are\ncompletely open source. When it comes to firmware, however, the A311D is not\nfully open source; there\u2019s closed-source code in the Wi-Fi firmware and the\nboot/TF-A firmware. The other modules all also have various bits of closed\nfirmware, except for the RKX7 module that uses a Kintex-7 FPGA and hence comes\nwith a hefty price tag. Using the RKX7 module, you can have a fully open\nsource laptop, from operating system down to the firmware, which is, as far as\nI can tell, unique.\n\nHowever, the amount of closed firmware code for each of the other boards is\nrelatively small, and in some cases \u2013 such as with the LS1028A \u2013 can be\navoided, too. If you care about using as little closed-source code as possible\non your computers, but you also want a capable, modern laptop, I\u2019m honestly\nnot entirely sure if there\u2019s even any competition for the Reform. Considering\nhow small the MNT team is, this is a remarkable achievement, and definitely\nsomething they can be proud of.\n\nMNT takes it one step further, though, and goes out of its way to let you know\nwhich module makes its schematics and CAD sources available. It should come as\nno surprise, of course, that the schematics and CAD sources for everything\nelse \u2013 casing, motherboard, custom parts, and so on \u2013 are all available from\nMNT, too. This focus on schematics sounds entirely alien to most people today,\nbut it used to be the norm to get schematics with the computer you bought,\nallowing you to make modifications, repair damage, and generally gain\nunderstanding of how your computer worked.\n\nSpeaking of schematics, the unique experience the Reform offers starts with\nsomething I normally don\u2019t really care about \u2013 unboxing. The Reform comes in a\nbeautiful box, and is accompanied by a nice sleeve made of vegan leather,\nentirely custom for the Reform and handmade in Berlin. You also get something\nin the box that\u2019s quite unique, something I only vaguely remember from my\nyouth, an art form lost to the mists of time: a goddamn paper manual. It\ndetails all the various aspects of the machine, the software, and how to use\nit. And near the end of the manual?\n\nPrinted schematics.\n\nIn 2024, it\u2019s pretty much unheard of for any laptop, smartphone, or tablet to\ncome with an actual printed manual, especially not one as nice and in-depth\nlike the Reform one. It contains usage instructions, detailed parts\nreplacement instructions, the aformentioned detailed schematics, and even\nbills of materials for the various parts of the machine. In contrast, most\nother laptops will ship with a useless one-page quickstart guide, a few\nlegally mandated warranty and safety leaflets, perhaps some stickers to\nproudly display your corporate loyalty, and if you\u2019re lucky a QR code you have\nto blindly trust that may take you to a manual. Seeing a full, paper manual,\nlike in the olden days, with so much information, is very refreshing and\nwelcome.\n\nMoving from the accessories to the actual laptop itself, and you\u2019ll be in for\nan entirely different experience than from any other laptop. The first thing\nyou notice when you pick it up is just how much of a chonker the Reform is. It\nclearly harkens back to the laptops of the early to mid \u201990s, and comes in at\na hefty 29 x 20.5 x 4 cm, and it weighs a solid 1.9 kg. Don\u2019t let the \u201990s\nstyling fool you, though \u2013 unlike the \u201990s fragile plastic that\u2019s become the\nnemesis of retrocomputing enthusiasts the world over, the Reform is made\nalmost entirely out of thick sheets of aluminium \u2013 save for the bottom, which\nwe\u2019ll get to later \u2013 with a solid internal structure, giving the whole laptop\na level of solidity I simply didn\u2019t expect. There\u2019s no bending, flexing, or\ntwisting any part or angle of this machine.\n\nThe Reform is angular and industrial, all the way around, again taking a page\nout of \u201990s laptop design and construction. It\u2019s unlike anything else on the\nmarket today.\n\nFlipping the device over reveals the real star of the show: a thick sheet of\ntransparent plastic, giving you a clear view of the gorgeous insides of the\nmachine. MNT has clearly put a lot of effort into making the insides looks\namazing, and they\u2019ve certainly hit the mark \u2013 this is a work of art, and I\ncan\u2019t get enough of looking at it. The symmetrical individual battery cells,\nthe black PCBs, the shining, silvery heat sink, the exposed cabling \u2013 it\u2019s all\nvery attractive.\n\nIt\u2019s not just for looks, though, as there\u2019s a lot of function in this form.\nThe symmetrically laid-out battery cells are, of course, user-replaceable, and\nas such, this design makes them easily accessible. The ribbon cable connecting\nthe input device to the mainboard is also easily accessible, which is useful\nsince you can opt for either a trackball or a touchpad, and of course, you can\nchange your mind later.\n\nThere\u2019s also a lot of space in here for activities, as those with the right\nskills are encouraged to mod and expand the laptop to their heart\u2019s desire.\nGoing onto the MNT forums, you can find all kinds of mods and expansions, from\npeople stuffing cellular modems and UART ports into their Reforms, to a mad\nlad who removed half of the battery cells to make space for an additional\nEthernet port. On top of that, future SoC modules and heat sinks might require\nmore internal space, so having room to spare aids in future-proofing.\n\nGoing around the laptop, there\u2019s a ton of ports to play around with. On the\nleft side, you\u2019ve got the barrel power plug, an Ethernet port, an audio jack,\nand the SD card slot used too boot the system (depending on your setup). On\nthe right side, there\u2019s three USB-A ports and a full-size HDMI port. The three\nUSB ports are USB 2.0 on the SoC module my machine shipped with, but USB 3.0\non all the other modules. The port selection is more than enough for a laptop\nof this size, but I would\u2019ve preferred it to have USB-C charging instead of\nusing a barrel jack, and having USB-C ports in general would\u2019ve been nice for\nfuture-proofing.\n\nThe MNT logo is stamped into the metal of the lid, and opening the lid up\nreveals a few more unique aspects of the laptop. First and foremost, instead\nof a trackpad, my model came with the optional trackball, surrounded by five\nclicky, mechanical buttons. The keyboard is fully mechanical, evenly backlit,\nand entirely custom-designed. At the top of the deck, between the display and\nthe keyboard, sits a tiny black and white OLED, used to control several\naspects of the device.\n\nThe trackball is great. It\u2019s smooth, feels great to the touch, and the clicky,\nmechanical \u2018mouse\u2019 buttons are something I\u2019ve never seen before. The bigger\nbuttons on the side are the main left and right buttons, and while holding\ndown either of the corner buttons, the trackball will scroll, and the middle\nbutton is, well, the middle mouse button. Of course, these buttons are all\nprogrammable, and on top of that, you\u2019re free to replace the trackball with\nthe trackpad yourself if you don\u2019t like it. I do actually like the trackball,\nthough, and got used to it very quickly.\n\nI\u2019m a bit more torn on the keyboard, though. It feels and sounds absolutely\namazing, without that high-pitched springy sound I tend to dislike. The keys\nhave just enough travel to not become comical, as some mechanical keyboard\ntend to go for, and the keycaps are quite stable. It\u2019s the layout, however,\nthat doesn\u2019t work as well for me. The default layout moves the left control\nkey to where caps lock normally is, which I know quite a few people prefer,\nbut I do not. There are a few other layout choices that are odd, but nothing\ntoo extreme, and you\u2019re of course entirely free to reprogram the keyboard and\nmove the keycaps around.\n\nOne choice, though, bothers me a lot: the right shift key sits to the right of\nthe up arrow key, and because my hands are not very large, I have issues\nhitting it with my right pinky. I continuously end up hitting the up arrow\nkey, which is infuriating during typing. I\u2019m not entirely sure how I would\naddress this myself, and for now, it makes typing on the keyboard a very\nconscious affair. It\u2019s not a \u2018get used to it\u2019 issue; it\u2019s a physical issue of\nmy pinky simply not being long enough to comfortably hit that right shift key.\nThat being said, keyboards are deeply personal, and your experience could\neasily be entirely different.\n\nThe little OLED display offers several options, like turning the device on and\noff, checking the battery status, turning up or down the keyboard backlight,\nand checking the system\u2019s status. Of course, this, too, is entirely open and\nprogrammable, so you can do whatever you want with this display by hacking\naway at its firmware. For instance, the person who removed half of the battery\ncells edited the firmware to make sure it wouldn\u2019t display \u201c0%\u201d for the\nmissing cells.\n\nThe display is far better than it has any right to be, and at 1920\u00d71080 at\n12\u2032\u2032, it\u2019s razor sharp, plenty bright, and looks great. I had expected the\ndisplay to be a possible pain point \u2013 good displays at reasonable prices are a\nlot harder to find than people think \u2013 but my worries were unfounded, and I\nsimply have no complaints about the display whatsoever.\n\nTwo tiny speakers sit at the base of the display, and while they get the job\ndone, they\u2019re not particularly great. Spoken word sounds totally fine and\nacceptable, but things like music tends to sound tinny, a bit sharp, and gets\nunpleasant quick as you up the volume. For any possible future revision or\nfollow-up model, I hope MNT considers making use of the ample space in the\nbase to add some beefier, more high quality speakers. It\u2019s not a dealbreaker\nor anything, but something of note if music playback is absolutely essential\nto you.\n\nThe word that comes to mind when handling this hardware is industrial. The\naluminium panels seem thicker than on most other laptops, and aside from the\ntrackball, you\u2019re not going to find any curves or swoops here. It\u2019s all\nangular, with exposed screws and an incredibly satisfying and assuring clunk\nwhen you close the lid, almost like a solid car door. The goal of this design\nclearly wasn\u2019t to be elegant or graceful, but to be almost brutalist.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean this is a case of form over function \u2013 MNT clearly made\ntons of clear affordances for function here, like the tons of space for mods,\nthe ease with which the internals can be changed and altered, and its\nupgradeability. It also happens to be entirely passively cooled, so there\u2019s no\nfans and noise, which is also a testament to this design being very, very\nfunctional.\n\nIt\u2019s a massive counter to modern laptop design, and I love it.\n\nThe price of the Reform is more reasonable than I initially expected. The\ncurrent base model, with the A311D SoC module, without an NVMe or any of the\naccessories mine came with, costs \u20ac1200, which, considering how niche and\nunique this product is, I find a remarkably reasonable price for a laptop\nthat, thanks to its upgradeability and repairability, can grow with you as new\nSoC modules become available.\n\nMy exact configuration, which adds a 1TB NVMe, the sleeve, and the printed\nmanual, comes in at \u20ac1498. If you want the recently announced, faster RK3588\nSoC module, add \u20ac200. Note that since MNT is based in Berlin, customers\noutside the EU might face additional import duties and fees.\n\n### Familiar software\n\nThe software experience of the MNT Reform is far less interesting or exciting\nthan its hardware, and that\u2019s a good thing. It runs plain Debian with some\nmodifications by MNT, and much like when I reviewed Raptor\u2019s POWER9 hardware,\nthe beauty of Linux is that assuming the architecture is decently supported,\nthere\u2019s really not much difference between running Linux on, say, POWER9 or\nARM on the one hand, and x86 on the other. All the same packages are\n(generally) available in both repositories, so all your favourite\napplications, tools, and other stuff are right there, just as if you were\nusing an x86 machine.\n\nTo turn the machine on, you first have to connect the batteries internally \u2013\nan easy process described in the manual \u2013 because they ship disconnected to\nprevent battery drain. Second, you need to put the supplied SD card in the SD\ncard slot \u2013 in my case, it contained the bootloader \u2013 and then finally turn\nthe machine\u2019s System Controller on with the circle button in the top-right of\nthe keyboard. The small OLED will come to life, and offer up several options\nin a menu, navigable through the keyboard. Select the option to boot the\nactual machine, and off you go.\n\nThere are several different setups you can use to boot the Reform, and it uses\nU-Boot to make them possible. Depending on your SoC module, you can boot from\nSD card, an NVMe drive, or eMMC storage, and I\u2019m assuming things like USB or\nnetwork booting are possible as well. The machine MNT sent me was set up with\nthe operating system installed on the NVMe drive, but with the bootloader on\nthe included SD card. While the Reform is clearly focused on supporting and\nrunning Linux, it should theoretically support any operating system that\nsupports the SoC module you\u2019re using, such as the various BSDs, and\ntechnically Windows on ARM, too, if you\u2019re the kind of individual who loves\nwatching the world burn?\n\nOnce the process is complete, you end up at the familiar Linux login prompt \u2013\nthis is a Linux system. I know this. Here you will find some of the\nmodifications to Debian MNT has made. Most importantly, it lists some often-\nused commands you might want to use, how to start the two desktop environments\nthat come preinstalled, and so on. This is a great addition to regular Debian,\nbecause it lists some of the things that MNT has prepared for its users that\nyou otherwise would not be aware of unless you had read the manual.\n\nYou can either choose to keep using the system through the command line \u2013 not\nan uncommon occurrence for a lot of the kind of people interested in this\ndevice, I\u2019m sure \u2013 or load up one of the two preinstalled desktop environments\nMNT has set up out of the box: a tiling setup using sway, and a more\ntraditional windowing environment using wayfire. Both of them have been\nmodified and adapted to integrate nicely with the hardware, with things like\nbattery information, display brightness controls, and so on, as well as a few\nother niceties. Since I\u2019m a KDE user, MNT also preinstalled KDE for me,\nsomething I would\u2019ve done myself anyway, since I\u2019m not a huge fan of the\n\u2018assemble your own GUI\u2019 types of environments things like sway and wayfire\ntend to be used for (but to each their own, of course!).\n\nFrom here on out, I would guess most Reform owners go their own separate ways,\nbuilding out their computing environment to their own exacting specifications.\nThe preinstalled sway and wayfire environments offer good starting points;\nminimalist setups you can configure further as you may like. More complete\nenvironments, like the aforementioned KDE, but also GNOME, Xfce, or whatever\nelse is available in the Debian repositories are of course a command away, as\nwell. This is a Linux system. You know this.\n\nMy experience with using the Debian installation on the Reform has been rather\nuneventful, just as you\u2019d expect. I\u2019m not a performance benchmarker, so all I\ncan do is relay my experiences using the machine for day-to-day work. KDE\nworks and runs without any issues, and performance is fine \u2013 applications open\nfast, perform well, and I didn\u2019t notice any unexpected stutters.\nUnsurprisingly, testing the sway and wayfire environments yielded the same\nresults. I didn\u2019t try any GTK environments like GNOME or Xfce, but I doubt the\nexperience would be any different.\n\nBefore long, you\u2019ll forget you\u2019re using a laptop that isn\u2019t x86. In that\nsense, the story here is identical to Raptor\u2019s POWER9 workstations; as a Linux\nuser, moving between different architectures like x86, ARM, and POWER is\nalmost entirely transparent, and your favourite applications and tools are\njust right there, working as intended.\n\nMostly.\n\nOf course, there are always things that are tied entirely to x86 and won\u2019t be\navailable, but in the case of the Reform, I don\u2019t think any of them really\nmatter. First and foremost, it comes as no surprise that gaming isn\u2019t really a\nthing here, since Steam is not available on ARM Linux, and even if it were,\nvirtually none of its games would be. You can use tools like box86 to run some\nx86 games on ARM, though, but it\u2019s still relatively early in development, and\nit\u2019ll need a lot more work and compatible games to become a viable option.\n\nThe second class of applications you won\u2019t find on ARM Linux are things like\nDiscord, Slack, and similarly coded applications. These are websites\nmasquerading as applications using entire Chromium rendering engines, and\ntheir respective parent companies are generally not interested in supporting\nanything but x86. Luckily, though, these applications are almost always also\navailable on the web, so you can just load them up in your browser and use\nthem that way if you really must.\n\nThere is one piece of software I want to talk about in more detail, and that\u2019s\nFirefox. I\u2019m not exactly sure where the problem lies, but Firefox tends to eat\nup quite a bit of processor power, and more complex websites like the\nWordPress backend, YouTube, and the various online CAT tools I use for my job\ndefinitely have performance issues. Typing in the WordPress backend or my CAT\ntools often has delays and stutters, and things like going full screen on\nYouTube takes several seconds, and loading the various parts of the YouTube\nwebsite is often quite slow. Video playback is not the issue here; YouTube\u2019s\nwebsite is. Regular websites load, render, and perform entirely normally and\nwithout any issues, so it seems to be restricted to complex web apps and\nunoptimised websites.\n\nIt\u2019s really the only case where I noticed any substantial downside to using\nthe Reform compared to my other, mainstream x86 devices, and while not a\nmajor, gamebreaking issue, it does bother me. I also tried Chromium, which\nseemed to perform just a little better and more consistently. I\u2019m not sure\nwhere the problem lies, but my uneducated guess would be that Firefox is\nsimply less optimised for Linux on ARM than Chromium. I\u2019m hoping subsequent\nreleases of Firefox will address these problems, because there\u2019s no chance in\nhell I\u2019m using anything based on Google\u2019s Chromium. I\u2019ll gladly take some\nminor lag or stutters if it means not having to contribute to Chrome\u2019s\nstaggering monopoly.\n\nBattery life has been only so-so, perhaps 3-4 hours per charge, depending on\nwhat I was doing. It\u2019s definitely not class-leading or anything, so if you\nspend a lot of time unplugged from the wall you might want to ensure you\u2019re\nbringing the charger with you, but as always with battery life, your\nexperience may be entirely different. On top of that, this is a 1.9 kg laptop,\nso it\u2019s not the most portable device to begin with.\n\n###### Approachable community\n\nThere\u2019s one more thing I\u2019d like to mention, and that\u2019s the sense of community\nand just how approachable MNT is. When you read about some of the modding\nprojects people have done, you\u2019ll often see references to MNT helping the\nmodders out, and the MNT forum and various Mastodon accounts underline this.\nIf you have a Reform and wish to perform a hardware or software mod, MNT most\nlikely would love to help you with tips, advice, suggestions, and answers to\nany questions you might have.\n\nSuch direct lines of communication with the very people building the hardware\nyou\u2019re trying to use and alter to your liking is rare.\n\n### Entirely unique\n\nThe MNT Reform is entirely unique.\n\nThere is nothing else like it on the market. I am not aware of any other\nlaptop designed entirely by and for open source, open hardware, and Linux\nenthusiasts that does its utmost best \u2013 within reason \u2013 to be entirely open,\nfrom hardware down to firmware. A laptop that encompasses the ideals of user\nownership, repairability, and upgradeability, ideals that once used to be the\nnorm in the world of computing. You\u2019d expect a strong focus on such ideals\nwould compromise the user experience, but nothing could be further from the\ntruth.\n\nI\u2019ve done all my usual laptop tasks with the Reform, from browsing the web, to\nwatching video, to my job as a translator involving complex CAT tools in the\nform of complex web apps, and more. Aside from the aforementioned small issues\nwith Firefox and the larger issue of the right shift key, using the Reform and\nDebian on ARM has been a great experience. I could easily use this as my only\nlaptop, and I would barely have to change anything about my usage patterns.\n\nMNT proves that the ideals of open hardware need not to be an impediment to\nusability. You could give the Reform to any normal user not particularly\ninterested in technology, and after some remarks about the chunky design, I\ndoubt they\u2019d have any trouble using it for their day-to-day tasks. Even\nstripped from all of its additional, idealistic benefits, the Reform is just a\ngreat laptop running a popular Linux distribution, and that in and of itself\nmakes it a worthwhile purchase to consider if you\u2019re looking for a new Linux\nlaptop.\n\nAdd to this the reasonable price, the repairability and upgradeability to\nincrease the device\u2019s longevity, and the Reform is a steal. If you also happen\nto be a tinkerer and programmer, capable of and interested in creating\nhardware and software modifications to truly make the Reform uniquely yours,\nthen there\u2019s really no other laptop that even comes close.\n\n#### About The Author\n\n##### Thom Holwerda\n\nFollow me on Mastodon @thomholwerda@exquisite.social\n\n#### 11 Comments\n\n  1. 2024-03-13 1:54 pm\n\ncb88\n\nHmm no real risc-v option yet.

This hardware definetely deserves all the love it can take,\nthere is (as you expressed) nothing that compares.\n\nI am waiting for a MNT Pocket Reform (which is probably getting shipped soon).\n\nMNT Reform cheks many things that no other commercial (buy and get a ready to\nuse product) do. In my situation this goes to use a industry standard/generic\nuser replaceable battery, fanless, unmatched motherboard upgradeable (right\nnow you can choose between 6 different system on chip board), special\nattention to details like programmable/mechanic keyboard and pointer devices\n(those are incredible in itself), repairability, a fancy OLED secondary\nprogammable little status display and of course the ethics and mindset behind\nit all. Not only you won\u2019t easily find products with all these features\ncombined, but you will hardly find any with a combination of some of them. Of\ncourse these are the things I really value, but there are other features that\nother will value than I\u2019m not talking about.\n\nWhile it is more expensive than other platforms, the world moves where the\nmoney is put, and this company well deserves being there.\n\n  3. 2024-03-14 11:36 am\n\nBill Shooter of Bul Platinum Prime\n\nFirst of all I commend MNT for creating the product, it seems really nice and\nwell thought out and fairly future proof. There is one concern I have, that is\nprobably going to be a deal breaker for me. Uboot/Device tree. I\u2019ve had too\nmany Uboot devices that only work with custom kernels, preventing the\nupgradability and life time of the device. Its not using stock releases from\nUbuntu/Debian/Fedora. but modified Debian. The whole allure of Linux for me,\nis the ability to easily swap distros. If one misbehaves, oh well the other\nwill work fine. Now if I want to use a new feature even one in Debian\u2019s new\nrelease, I probably have to wait for MNT to update their sources before I can\nupgrade. For the price of a Raspberry pi or most single board computers, I can\nforgive this, but not at full laptop prices.\n\n     * 2024-03-14 3:30 pm\n\nAlfman verbose=1\n\nBill Shooter of Bul,\n\n> Its not using stock releases from Ubuntu/Debian/Fedora. but modified Debian.\n> The whole allure of Linux for me, is the ability to easily swap distros.

It seems nicer\nthan the laptops I own.\n\nAbout your point though, you are spot on! Having separate sources for software\nis invaluable as a customer! Almost all of the hardware I own with software\nthat is proprietary and/or only supported exclusively by the hardware vendor\nhas lost software support long before the hardware itself fails. The\nresult...\u201dI\u2019ve have to throw out yet another piece of working hardware over a\ndamn software support issue\u201d, which is so messed up. The x86 architecture is\nmore or less grandfathered into different norms from long ago where installing\na new OS from outside sources is common and expected. Other architectures have\ngreat technical merit and usually run more efficient, but the risk of being\ntethered to a single entity that drops the ball on EOL support is nearly 100%.\nThis is so aggravating and bad for the planet. I try to vote with my feet, but\nunfortunately the majority of the time, if it ain\u2019t x86, software support will\nfail before the hardware does.\n\n       * 2024-03-14 5:36 pm\n\nAlfman verbose=1\n\n> if it ain\u2019t x86, software support will fail before the hardware does.\n\nI\u2019m just noticing just how much I sound like a cheerleader for intel there,\nhaha.\n\nI\u2019ve been seeking x86 alternatives including ARM for multiple decades, but the\nvendor locking keeps creating so many problems. I am so disappointed they\ndon\u2019t have ubiquitous open standards that work everywhere to give us a strait\nforward means of decoupling commodity hardware and software. Unfortunately\nmany manufacturers want customers to remain tethered to them and they want to\ncontrol the levers of planned obsolescence. These business incentives conflict\nwith open platforms, which is likely why there\u2019s so little progress.\n\nAt least x86 computers matured decades ago before these changes. if x86 were\ninvented today it would likely suffer from all the same tight coupling and\nnon-viable software alternatives.\n\n         * 2024-03-14 10:58 pm\n\nBill Shooter of Bul Platinum Prime\n\nSame. I keep posting about the arm initiative to accomplish this. it exists,\nbut no one uses it. outside of a few hobbyist boards. I have no idea why it\ndidn\u2019t take over.\n\nhttps://www.arm.com/architecture/system-architectures/systemready-\ncertification-program\n\n  4. 2024-03-14 7:21 pm\n\ndjame\n\nHi Tom, thanks for testing this machine ! What can you tell about its\nperformance ? any chance you can run some benchmarks on it ? at the very least\nthe good old unixbench (which can be run from the phoronix test suite I think\nhttps://github.com/phoronix-test-suite/phoronix-test-suite/ once installed:\nit\u2019s run like this :\n\nphoronix-test-suite benchmark byte.\n\n     * 2024-03-15 5:00 am\n\namospalla\n\nThere are several modules for the Reform. One user posted his experiences here\nhttps://community.mnt.re/t/ls1082a-questions/1863. Also in some months an\nRK3588 is about to be available which will be the fastest module available.\n\nJust from memory, there are SOCs with ARM A53, A55, A72, A73, A75 and A76\ncores to choose from.\n\n  5. 2024-03-15 7:44 am\n\nNaGERST\n\nThe Mali g52 whilst fully compatible with the open source Lima and Panfrost\ndrivers is not a fast circut. It is only 36% faster tan the by now very old\nAdreno 508 budget GPU found in budget Xperia mobile devices from 2017 like the\nXa2 (discovery).\n\n     * 2024-03-15 10:52 am\n\ncb88\n\nOptimistically 163.2Gigaflops, or 27.2Gigaflops in its weakest\nconfiguration... since it is the MP4 that means its somewhere between\n108.8-163.2 depending on how each EU is configured.\n\nSo yeah... amazingly weak for even a mobile GPU these days. By comparison my\nLegion Go handheld does 8.6Teraflops... like I can lock it to 30FPS and low-\nmedium settings and it still look better than PS4 Pro graphics.\n\n  6. 2024-03-18 11:49 am\n\nbert64\n\nWould have been nice to have USB type C, including for power (instead of the\nbarrel connector). With pretty much all phones now being USBC, and laptops\nalso often using USBC for power it\u2019s just more convenient. I have a 300W 4x C\nadapter on my desk, and they are becoming more and more common everywhere.\n\nNow if i forget my power adapter i can almost always borrow one, or buy one\neasily in any local store. Not so with barrel connectors where you need to\nfind the correct size, correct polarity and correct voltage out of a large\nnumber of possibilities.\n\n### Search OSNEWS\n\n### OSnews Accounts\n\n    * Create Account\n    * Login\n\n### Support OSnews\n\n    * OSnews Patreon\n    * Support OSnews\n\n### Featured articles\n\n    * Microsoft adds driver to Windows that prevents changing the default browser using the registry\n    * Setting up a YubiKey on Linux is a mess, and it really shouldn\u2019t be\n    * Fedora change proposal suggests switching the main Fedora Workstation release to KDE Plasma\n\n### Topics\n\n### Related Posts\n\n    * NuXT 2.0 motherboard: a new 8088 motherboard for your DIY PC clone\n\nSeptember 8, 2023 \u2022 2 Comments\n\n    * Linux Is Top Requested Feature at Dell \u2018Ideastorm\u2019\n\nFebruary 20, 2007 \u2022 22 Comments\n\n    * Lichee Console 4A, RISC-V mini laptop: review, benchmarks and early issues\n\nJanuary 17, 2024 \u2022 9 Comments\n\n    * HP 3000 Series 33: 16-bits of sapphire\n\nNovember 29, 2016 \u2022 10 Comments\n\n    * Dell To Announce Massive Laptop Battery Recall\n\nAugust 15, 2006 \u2022 4 Comments\n\n### Popular Posts\n\n    * Some personal news\n\nMarch 23, 2024 \u2022 69 Comments\n\n    * Microsoft adds driver to Windows that prevents changing the default browser using the registry\n\nApril 8, 2024 \u2022 46 Comments\n\n    * Hackintosh is (almost) dead\n\nMarch 17, 2024 \u2022 28 Comments\n\n    * iXsystems: focusing on Linux makes more sense than FreeBSD\n\nApril 9, 2024 \u2022 37 Comments\n\n    * Secure by design: Google\u2019s perspective on memory safety\n\nMarch 15, 2024 \u2022 34 Comments\n\n### Popular Posts (Last 3 Years)\n\n    * Apple\u2019s new M1 Pro and M1 Max processors take its in-house Arm-based chips to new heights\n\nOctober 18, 2021\n\n    * Microsoft is testing a desktop watermark for unsupported Windows 11 PCs\n\nFebruary 27, 2022\n\n    * Rant: year of Linux on the desktop\n\nDecember 29, 2022\n\n    * A few thoughts on Fuchsia security\n\nJune 14, 2021\n\n    * Apple intentionally kills web applications for EU users in iOS 17.4 onward to spite its EU users\n\nFebruary 15, 2024\n\n### About OSnews\n\nOSnews Privacy Statement \u00a9 OSnews Inc.
