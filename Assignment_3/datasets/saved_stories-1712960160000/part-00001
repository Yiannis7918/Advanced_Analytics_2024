Wass. The article described unsolved problems\nof employees which are delegated upwards causing the \u201cmonkey\u201d to jump on a\nmanager's back. This increases workload for a manager.\n\nThis analogy struck me hard. I have taken my own spin on the analogy and\napplied to my world of product management. Product managers do not own a team\nbut they manage sideways, upwards and downwards. If we are not good at monkey\nmanagement, we can lose track of time and individual autonomy. It would be\neasier for Engineering, Design, and Leadership to target product team for\nbeing a bottleneck.\n\nLet us explore a scenario which shall show how monkey jumps from one back to\nanother.\n\nLeadership team has decided to work on a key strategic initiative. The\nstrategy is broadcasted to an entire organization, and Product team will be\nresponsible for executing that strategy. They will need help from Design and\nEngineering. Design will explore solutions and help understand the usability\nof a solution. Engineering will explore feasibility of a solution. There are\nother functions of the business where co-ordination is required. But we shall\nstop here for simplicity.\n\nA problem-statement has been presented by Product team along with what needs\nto be accomplished. Design comes up with a solution to the problem.\nEngineering recognizes a problem with proposed design. It has asked Product to\nreconsider the requirements.\n\nLet us analyze how the monkey jumped from one back to another.\n\nMonkey went from Leadership to Product to execute the strategy. It was boss-\nimposed meaning it cannot be disregarded by Product team. It is expected to\ndeliver otherwise the team will face penalty.\n\nProduct passed the monkey to Design after finalizing requirements based on the\nexpert knowledge about the business and its customers. It was system-imposed\nmeaning there is an active support required from cross-functional teams.\nIgnoring will result in penalty, though not a direct penalty.\n\nEngineering passed the monkey back to Product and Design because requirements\nneed further clarification. Product can decide to descope or influence for\nsupport to deliver on original requirements. Design is now expecting Product\nto provide clarification. Product either can make on-the-spot decision or\nmight need more time to collect information before informing Engineering and\nDesign with next steps.\n\nWhere is the monkey? Product!\n\nIf Product does not get this monkey off its back soon, frustration will grow\nand Leadership will follow-up because of lack of momentum.\n\nLet us analyze another scenario when there is a joint problem.\n\nSame scenario as above, but Engineering comes back saying they can pursue the\nproposed solution by Design with all Product requirements, but will require\nre-architecting the system. Additionally, this will optimize the system for\nfuture needs, but pushing the launch date by several quarters.\n\nWhere is the monkey now? Is it the Product, Engineering or both? And is it\nknown that it is a joint problem? Or the blame game is happening because\nProduct is not allowing for time to refactor code and optimizing the database\nas the business grows.\n\nProduct is in dilemma because neither business nor clients care about system\nre-architecture, but it is critical to maintain technology systems for scale\nand growth. Engineering is looking for a green light on moving forward because\neverything else will need to be paused. Why is Engineering looking for\napproval? It is the business that provides funding to Engineering department.\n\nProduct needs to communicate this up the chain. Product cannot singularly make\nthe decision. But a Leadership team that is not involved in technology\nrequires Product recommendation with pros and cons before a decision can be\nmade.\n\nThe monkey is on Product's back again.\n\nThis might not be a shared perspective from Product, but it is the result of\ncomplex organizational design. It is a joint problem indeed, but still\nrequires momentum from Product to deliver on strategic objective.\n\nDespite the complexity, monkey ownership continues for Product.\n\nMonkey management is effective when there is organizational complexity. It has\ntwo critical benefits. The first is time management and the second is creating\nhigh agency staff who are able to deal with problems autonomously.\n\nIf you understand whose back the monkey is on, you can understand the art of\ntime management and delegation.\n\nDrop me a note if you are curious to chat.
