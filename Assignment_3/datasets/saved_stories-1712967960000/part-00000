At the most alarmist are concerns about AI going rogue and\nterminating its human masters.\n\nBut behind the calls for a pause on the development of AI is a suite of more\ntangible social ills. Among them are the risks AI poses to people\u2019s privacy\nand dignity and the inevitable fact that, because the algorithms under AI\u2019s\nhood are programmed by humans, it is just as biased and discriminatory as many\nof us. Throw in the lack of transparency about how AI is designed, and by\nwhom, and it\u2019s easy to understand why so much time these days is devoted to\ndebating its risks as much as its potential.\n\nBut my own research as a psychologist who studies how people make decisions\nleads me to believe that all these risks are overshadowed by an even more\ncorrupting, though largely invisible, threat. That is, AI is mere keystrokes\naway from making people even less disciplined and skilled when it comes to\nthoughtful decisions.\n\n## Making thoughtful decisions\n\nThe process of making thoughtful decisions involves three common sense steps\nthat begin with taking time to understand the task or problem you\u2019re\nconfronted with. Ask yourself, what is it that you need to know, and what do\nyou need to do in order to make a decision that you\u2019ll be able to credibly and\nconfidently defend later?\n\nThe answers to these questions hinge on actively seeking out information that\nboth fills gaps in your knowledge and challenges your prior beliefs and\nassumptions. In fact, it\u2019s this counterfactual information \u2013 alternative\npossibilities that emerge when people unburden themselves of certain\nassumptions \u2013 that ultimately equips you to defend your decisions when they\nare criticized.\n\nThoughtful decisions involve considering your values and weighing trade-offs.\n\nThe second step is seeking out and considering more than one option at a time.\nWant to improve your quality of life? Whether it\u2019s who you vote for, the jobs\nyou accept or the things you buy, there\u2019s always more than one road that will\nget you there. Expending the effort to actively consider and rate at least a\nfew plausible options, and in a manner that is honest about the trade-offs you\nare willing to make across their pros and cons, is a hallmark of a thoughtful\nand defensible choice.\n\nThe third step is being willing to delay closure on a decision until after\nyou\u2019ve done all the necessary heavy mental lifting. It\u2019s no secret: Closure\nfeels good because it means you\u2019ve put a difficult or important decision\nbehind you. But the cost of moving on prematurely can be much higher than\ntaking the time to do your homework. If you don\u2019t believe me, just think about\nall those times you let your feelings guide you, only to experience regret\nbecause you didn\u2019t take the time to think a little harder.\n\n## Dangers of outsourcing decisions to AI\n\nNone of these three steps are terribly difficult to take. But, for most,\nthey\u2019re not intuitive either. Making thoughtful and defensible decisions\nrequires practice and self-discipline. And this is where the hidden harm that\nAI exposes people to comes in: AI does most of its \u201cthinking\u201d behind the\nscenes and presents users with answers that are stripped of context and\ndeliberation. Worse, AI robs people of the opportunity to practice the process\nof making thoughtful and defensible decisions on their own.\n\nConsider how people approach many important decisions today. Humans are well\nknown for being prone to a wide range of biases because we tend to be frugal\nwhen it comes to expending mental energy. This frugality leads people to like\nit when seemingly good or trustworthy decisions are made for them. And we are\nsocial animals who tend to value the security and acceptance of their\ncommunities more than they might value their own autonomy.\n\nAdd AI to the mix and the result is a dangerous feedback loop: The data that\nAI is mining to fuel its algorithms is made up of people\u2019s biased decisions\nthat also reflect the pressure of conformity instead of the wisdom of critical\nreasoning. But because people like having decisions made for them, they tend\nto accept these bad decisions and move on to the next one. In the end, neither\nwe nor AI end up the wiser.\n\n## Being thoughtful in the age of AI\n\nIt would be wrongheaded to argue that AI won\u2019t offer any benefits to society.\nIt most likely will, especially in fields like cybersecurity, health care and\nfinance, where complex models and massive amounts of data need to be analyzed\nroutinely and quickly. However, most of our day-to-day decisions don\u2019t require\nthis kind of analytic horsepower.\n\nBut whether we asked for it or not, many of us have already received advice\nfrom \u2013 and work performed by \u2013 AI in settings ranging from entertainment and\ntravel to schoolwork, health care and finance. And designers are hard at work\non next-generation AI that will be able to automate even more of our daily\ndecisions. And this, in my view, is dangerous.\n\nIn a world where what and how people think is already under siege thanks to\nthe algorithms of social media, we risk putting ourselves in an even more\nperilous position if we allow AI to reach a level of sophistication where it\ncan make all kinds of decisions on our behalf. Indeed, we owe it to ourselves\nto resist the siren\u2019s call of AI and take back ownership of the true privilege\n\u2013 and responsibility \u2013 of being human: being able to think and choose for\nourselves. We\u2019ll feel better and, importantly, be better if we do.\n\n  * Psychology\n  * Artificial intelligence (AI)\n  * Technology\n  * Bias\n  * Critical thinking\n  * Critical thinking skills\n  * Decision psychology\n\n### Events\n\nMore events\n\n### Jobs\n\n  * ##### Faculty of Law - Academic Appointment Opportunities\n\n  * ##### Operations Manager\n\n  * ##### Senior Education Technologist\n\n  * ##### Audience Development Coordinator (fixed-term maternity cover)\n\n  * ##### Lecturer (Hindi-Urdu)\n\nMore jobs\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2010\u20132024, The Conversation Media Group Ltd\n\n", "frontpage": false}
