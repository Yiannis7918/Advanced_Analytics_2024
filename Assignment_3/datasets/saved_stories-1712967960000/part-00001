In this article, we've collected a number\nof notorious and fascinating bugs. Let's learn from other people's mistakes!\n\n## Introduction\n\nAnyone can make a mistake. It's a normal part of life. That would be fine, but\nthere are some mistakes that have become notorious and have left their mark in\nthe history of the Internet forever. Today, we will talk about such mistakes,\nor rather bugs that led to all kinds of consequences.\n\n## A real bug\n\nDo you remember the story of the very first bug? On September 9, 1947, Mark II\ncomputer operators found something strange. That something was a moth. The\nstory goes like this: the legendary Grace Hopper, known as \"Amazing Grace\" and\n\"Grandma COBOL\", has found an insect stuck between relay contacts in the Relay\nN70 on the Panel F.\n\nSo, something similar happened in 2023.\n\nThe experts at TechTuber NorthWestRepair shared a video on their channel where\nthey tried to find the reason why the NVIDIA RTX 4090 Founders Edition\ngraphics card didn't work. Its owner said it was showing \"signs of life\", but\nthere was no image on the monitor.\n\nThe video card service began with a short circuit check and voltage\nmeasurement, followed by a microscope check for defects. The check revealed a\nmalfunction in the graphics processor. They decided to take it off and\ndiscovered a real \"bug\". It was a fly.\n\nAfter the cleanup, testing showed that the video card began to operate\nproperly.\n\n## Copy-paste that sabotaged spaceflight\n\nThis is a story about an error that cost an estimated seven billion dollars\nand 10 years of work. That was the cost of development for the Ariane 5 space\nlaunch vehicle.\n\nAriane 5 was a European single-use launch vehicle. It was designed to launch\nmedium and heavy spacecraft to Earth orbit. The creation of the vehicle\ninvolved approximately one thousand manufacturing companies. Everything was\ngoing well, but not more than 40 seconds after the launch, the rocket\nexploded. It happened on June 4, 1996.\n\nAt an altitude of 4,000 meters, Ariane 5 veered off its flight path and self-\ndestructed. On June 13, 1996, a special committee began investigating the\ncrash. On July 19th, they released a detailed report on the accident.\n\nLong story short, the error was on the developers' part. They copypasted the\ncode from the control program of an earlier rocket model that had flown\nsuccessfully more than a hundred times. However, they didn't consider the fact\nthat Ariane 4 was flying on a different trajectory and at a different\nhorizontal speed.\n\nA fragment of rocket code that contains an error.\n\nTo learn more about this case, you can read the \"A space error: 370.000.000 $\nfor an integer overflow\" article.\n\n## \"Cupertino with our Italian comrades proved to be very fruitful\"\n\nWe all have to deal with autocorrection a lot when we write messages to our\nfamily, friends, and co-workers. Sometimes it helps us avoid spelling\nmistakes, but other times it doesn't work the way it's supposed to. Here's a\nstory about a not-so-successful but amusing autocorrect case.\n\nYou're surely familiar with the word \"cooperation\". The English language rules\ngive another variant for spelling this word as \"co-operation\".\n\nHowever, many dictionaries in early spell-checking systems, such as Microsoft\nWord, didn't have \"cooperation\" in the list of correct words. It would be fine\nif the smart system suggested replacing this option with a hyphenated one.\nAlthough, it may come as a surprise to you that it suggested replacing the\nword with \"Cupertino\", which is the name of a city in California.\n\nThat's why there are still many documents in the archives of NATO, the UN, and\nother organizations that contain the word \"Cupertino\" instead of\n\"cooperation\".\n\nHere's one of such examples: \"Cupertino with our Italian comrades proved to be\nvery fruitful.\"\n\n## Black Monday\n\nNo, it has nothing to do with Black Friday and marketplace sales. This is the\nday the Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced its biggest drop.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average is one of several stock market indexes\ncreated by the editor of the Wall Street Journal and co-founder of Dow Jones &\nCompany. It includes the stock prices of the 30 largest American companies,\nsuch as Apple, Coca-Cola, and Intel.\n\nIn early October 1987, the index began to decline. Several events have been\ncited as potential causes: the military escalation in the Persian Gulf area,\nthe unfortunate news about the health of the First Lady Nancy Reagan, West\nGermany and Japan tightening the tax laws, etc.\n\nAnd so, on October 19, 1987, Black Monday happened.\n\nThis is what an investor's Black Monday looks like. Screenshot source:\nYcharts.\n\nIt was the biggest crash that affected not only the USA but also other\ncountries such as Australia, Canada, the UK, etc.\n\nAfter that day, the crash was blamed directly on the developers. Although,\nexperts still argue about its true causes.\n\nHowever, according to the official version, program trading error led to the\ncrisis. The thing is that a special program automatically made deals, so that\ninvestors didn't have to constantly monitor financial quotes and manually\nperform all operations. The machines were guided by the market movements:\nIndexes go up \u2014 buy, they go down \u2014 sell.\n\nWhen the market shook, the machines simultaneously began selling millions of\ndollars worth of stock. But there was no one to buy them, so the program\nlowered the price even further. In just a day, the U.S. stock market lost\nabout $500 billion.\n\nHowever, there were some positive outcomes to the story. For example,\nregulators overhauled trade-clearing protocols. They limited the types of\nprogram trading that overwhelmed traders. They also developed a new regulatory\nprocess that temporarily halts trading in cases of sharp index fluctuations.\nThe institution of market makers has been developed.\n\n## A bit of crime\n\nIn the now distant year of 2015, there was a failure that resulted in the\nearly release of 3,200 inmates from prisons in Washington, D.C., USA. In fact,\nthe issue has been present in the system since 2002.\n\nThe computer system responsible for calculating inmates' time in prison and\ntheir \"bonuses\" for good behavior was malfunctioning. As a result, the inmates\nwere released approximately 49 days early due to the program failure. In the\nend, the decision was made to return some inmates to prison anyway, and others\nwere sent to penal labor.\n\nWhat conclusions can we draw from this story? Firstly, this is yet another\nexample of how even a small error in the code can have serious consequences.\nSecondly, in the pursuit of automating processes, one shouldn't forget about\ntesting them.\n\n## Youngest hacker in history\n\nIt's common for parents to enable parental controls on their devices when they\nhave young children. Video game consoles are no exception. However, history\nknows of a child who managed to log into his father's account on the Xbox Live\nservice.\n\nThis gifted boy was Kristoffer Von Hassel from San Diego. So, how did he\nmanage to hack into his father Robert's account? After unsuccessfully trying\nto guess a password, he simply pressed the space bar a few times and then hit\nEnter. And voila! He managed to get into his father's account.\n\nKristoffer didn't confess immediately. His father, Robert, worked in\ninformation security. Fascinated by his son's discovery, he sent the report\ndirectly to Microsoft. The company has acknowledged the vulnerability and\nfixed it.\n\n## Don't let bugs ruin your project!\n\nAs we can see from the examples above, even one badly written line of code can\nhave unfortunate and sometimes very serious consequences. Although, even real\nbugs (flies, for example :)) can mess things up from time to time.\nFortunately, this happens rarely.\n\nOne of the ways to create better and more secure code is to use static\nanalyzers such as PVS-Studio. The tool provides code analysis for the C, C++,\nC#, and Java programming languages.\n\nVisit our blog, where we regularly post articles about writing high-quality,\nclean code.
