The jury\ndeliberated for less than four hours. The government's case was doomed\nprimarily by a single government witness, Mark Furhman.\n\nSimpson\u2019s group of defense lawyers, which would come to be known as the \u201cdream\nteam,\u201d included F. Lee Bailey (shown in photo). Bailey conducted the cross-\nexamination of Furhman, a detective with the LAPD. It was Furhman who\ndiscovered a right-handed blood-covered glove at Simpson\u2019s residence that\nmatched a bloody glove found at the scene of the double-homicide. The blood\nfrom both gloves was identical, and DNA evidence from the left glove revealed\na mix of Simpson\u2019s blood and that of the two victims.\n\nThe theory of the defense was that Mark Fuhrman was a racist and had planted\nthe glove at Simpson's residence in order to frame Simpson, or at least, to\npump up the case against him. The actions and testimony of Furhman were more\nthan enough to implant reasonable doubt in the minds of the jury members.\n\nDuring Bailey\u2019s cross-examination of Fuhrman, Bailey trapped Fuhrman into a\nblatant, easily refuted lie: Fuhrman\u2019s insistence that he had never once\nuttered a racial slur during the last ten years of his life. Soon after, the\ndefense played for the jury tape recordings of Fuhrman\u2019s voice in which he not\nonly used racial slurs repeatedly, but additionally related frequent instances\nof LAPD police brutality and evidence-planting against African-Americans.\n\nFuhrman would never take the stand to refute the recordings or counter the\nallegations against him. He pled the Fifth Amendment (the right against self-\nincrimination) outside the presence of the jury, including to the questions,\n\u201cHas your testimony in this case been truthful?\u201c, \u201cHave you ever falsified\npolice reports?\u201d, and, \u201cDid you plant or manufacture any evidence in this\ncase?\u201d Fuhrman later pleaded no contest to perjury.\n\nThe defense wanted the jury informed that Fuhrman had pled the Fifth. Judge\nIto rejected that, citing a line of cases that warned against inflaming the\njury with a statement that might be wrongly perceived to be an admission of\nguilt. Instead, the jury was instructed:\n\n> Detective Mark Fuhrman is not available for further testimony as a witness\n> in this case. His unavailability for further testimony on cross-examination\n> is a factor which you may consider in evaluating his credibility as a\n> witness.\n\nIn the documentary film, OJ: Made in America, Bailey is interviewed about his\nstrategy for Fuhrman\u2019s cross-examination. It was simple, he said. Go after\nFuhrman\u2019s racism. Once that\u2019s \u201ccut\" out, Bailey explained, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing\nleft of consequence.\u201d\n\n#### Reset Password\n\nthe ZealousRedline Presents\n\nTermsPrivacyCookiesAbout UsFAQs\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2011-2024 Juridiko Corporation.
