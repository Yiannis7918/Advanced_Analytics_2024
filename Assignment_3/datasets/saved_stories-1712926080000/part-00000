I don't claim to be an authority on the matter - I'm still figuring\nthings out.\n\n## What I've done\n\nI should probably mention my \"work experience\", in chronological order -\n\n  1. Volunteering to teach ASHA workers to map, at a M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (Doctors Without Borders) clinic (2023). This was my first time teaching a group of people to map, and it was a disaster vital learning experience.^1 It was here that I learned that you need to be at least a little literate in English and technology to even be able to register for OSM, let alone contribute. Additionally, their own areas were very sparsely mapped, and most of them didn't have laptops either.\n  2. Conducting OSM workshops at IndiaFOSS (2023) and DelhiFOSS (2024)\n  3. Conducting six mapping parties in Delhi, with help from Sahil, Ravi, Aaru Swartz from SFLC.in, and many other friends. We started in June 2023, and we'll have our seventh one this Saturday.\n  4. Conducting a 5-day workshop for students of Planning and Architecture at IIT Roorkee (2023), in which I was assisted by Ravi.\n\n## What I've learned\n\nThis should not be considered perfect advice, for I'm constantly observing,\nfine-tuning, and sometimes changing my approach wholesale, to give the best\nexperience to participants and to attract as many people as I can to the\nmagical world of OpenStreetMap contribution.\n\n### The location\n\nSelect a place to map, one where participants would feel safe walking\naround.^2 This often means that mapping parties are held in relatively posh\nareas. Which means that map data in economically backwards areas is worse. For\nthis reason, I've been pondering about making an \"advanced\" variant of mapping\nparties, where we choose less-than-posh locations and only invite experienced\nand passionate mappers who are not afraid to venture in these areas.\n\nMarkets make good mapping party locations - shops and eateries are useful to\neveryone, and (unlike e.g. park features) are usually laid out linearly, which\nmakes them easier to map.\n\nAvoid indoor situations such as malls, as they can be challenging for\nbeginners.\n\nYou can map buildings and streets remotely in advance, to give new mappers\nsome points of reference.\n\nBefore and after - preparing buildings in Satya Niketan for a mapping party\n(using JOSM and the Terracer plugin)\n\n### Announcing and inviting\n\nAnnounce the party at least two weeks in advance. Make an event on\nhttps://osmcal.org/ and share it around. Reach out in\n\n  * the OpenStreetMap mailing lists\n  * the OpenStreetMap Discourse forums\n  * local OSM communities (the OpenStreetMap Community Index may help you find them)\n  * FOSS circles\n  * LUGs (Linux User Groups)\n  * GIS circles\n  * colleges (especially data science and planning and architecture departments)\n  * social media, etc.\n\nBy announcing and conducting parties regularly, you'll build up a community.\n\nOutside of OpenStreetMap communities, people don't know what OpenStreetMap is,\nnor what a \"mapping party\" entails. Describe what you'll be doing, e.g. like\nour Reddit announcement.\n\nMake sure to get the phone number of each participant. Talking over phone is\nthe most reliable way to announce the party, send reminders and confirmations,\nand to coordinate during the party.^3 And I say that as someone who doesn't\nlike talking on phone, unless it's over Jabber/XMPP. Cell calls are very\nlikely to always be recorded by the telecom provider. That way, there's no\nquestion of \"didn't check my messages/email\".\n\nAs a mapping party organizer, you are in the powerful position of choosing the\nplatform for the community you are building. It's easy to pick a proprietary\nnetwork like Telegram or an unsustainable one like Matrix, but for sake of\nyour community's privacy and freedom, I strongly recommend avoiding that\ntemptation and using Jabber/XMPP instead.\n\nWe frequently onboard participants to XMPP using projects like Quicksy and\nPrav, which make onboarding and contact discovery easier. We don't bridge to\nother networks either, so everyone can enjoy a modicum of privacy and freedom.\n\nYou should join me and others at the OpenStreetMap XMPP room and the OSM India\nXMPP room.\n\n### Equipment\n\nWe always ask participants to get some optional equipment - a charging cable,\na power bank, and a tape measure of some sort.\n\nStill, we find it useful to bring some spare devices.\n\nSomeone's phone develops a problem? I can lend them my old spare Android\nphone.\n\nI thought I wouldn't need my own laptop at an indoor iD mapping party, but it\nended up being used by a number of people - some who happened to be there and\nwere encouraged by us to join in, and some who missed the memo that a laptop\nwas required.\n\nGet a power bank and charging cables for common ports. Somebody else's phone\nmight run low on battery and you could lend them your power bank and cable.\n\nBring water and snacks on hot days.\n\nAll surveyors should carry pepper spray for emergencies, whether they involve\nhuman or non-human animals.^4 Usually, aggressive pet dogs who are outside\nwithout a leash. India is not for beginners, as the meme goes.\n\n#### A tape measure?\n\nA tape measure can be used to map a number of things, like maxwidth:physical\nfor barriers and width:carriageway for streets.^5 Especially important when\nyou realize that OSM has no concept of \"can a bicycle/motorcycle/car/truck\n[physically] pass through this street?\", only whether one is legally allowed\nor not. Which is perfectly sensible (since these vehicles don't have a\nuniversal standard width), but it means you have to survey street widths to\nanswer that question.\n\nA tailor's tape is good for mapping small lengths like kerb heights, bollard\ngaps, widths of pedestrian gates, etc. (These are all tagged with\nmaxwidth:physical.)\n\nA metal tape measure (used by carpenters and plumbers) can do all that, and\nalso measure somewhat larger distances such as widths of narrow streets. High-\nquality ones are stiff enough to extend a significant distance without\nfolding, allowing you to measure without needing someone to hold the other\nend.^6 This distance is known as the \"standout\" of a tape measure.\n\nSurveyor's tape (which can be 100m or more in length) can be used for all of\nthe above, and also for mapping widths of larger streets, buildings\nfootprints, indoor rooms, boundaries, etc.\n\nA laser distance meter (like the Bosch GLM 50-23G, which I have) is a more\nexpensive alternative to the above. It allows measurements in hard-to-reach\nplaces, e.g. measuring the maxheight:physical of tall height restrictors,\ngates, bridges, etc. Some have ingress protection (IP) ratings, allowing for\nuse in dusty and/or wet conditions. Some of them also have angle sensors,\nuseful for accurate distance measurements and for measuring inclines of roads,\nwheelchair ramps, steps, etc. (Inclines can also be measured on modern\nsmartphones without any other equipment, using free software such as Bubble.)\n\n### Meeting\n\nWe usually meet in a park near the mapping location. Ideally, the park will\nhave a gazebo or a cluster of benches to seat everyone comfortably - if not,\nmake do with a good patch of grass. In order to find a good location to meet,\nI've started surveying parks in the weeks leading up to a mapping party.\n\nThe park shouldn't be too far from the area to be mapped - you don't want\npeople getting tired from just walking to the place. If you're regrouping at\nthe same spot, they also need to get back after the survey.\n\nIt's important to fix a time for every component of the party and to stick to\nthe schedule. In particular, don't wait for latecomers - it amounts to\npunishing those who came on time, and gives latecomers further incentive to\ncome late. Participants don't have infinite time and energy, so waste not a\nminute.\n\n### Teaching\n\nOSM is a big rabbithole, so avoid trying to teach everything at once. Despite\nour best intentions, experienced mappers can overload people with information.\nMake a lesson plan each time and stick to it.\n\nYou may have to talk about some common issues before they happen. Some of them\ndepend on the editor you'll use.\n\n  1. Don't copy from other maps\n  2. Use Title Case in names\n  3. The name field can be left blank - not everything has a name\n  4. What the address fields mean (beginners often fill addr:street with the full address)\n  5. The format for phone numbers\n\n### Mapping\n\nSplit people into groups of 2-3 people, assign each group an area to cover,\nand agree upon meeting again in (say) one hour. Review everyone's changes.\n\nThis motivates people to contribute while also preventing duplication and\nconflicts. You could add a competitive aspect by announcing a winning\ngroup...but we've never done that.\n\n## What apps should we introduce?\n\nThis is a question I agonize over before each party and workshop.\n\nOrganic Maps? OsmAnd? StreetComplete? Every Door? Go Map!! and Vespucci? One,\nor many? And how many is too many?\n\n(Note that I don't have a whole lot of experience with Go Map!!, as I don't\nown an iOS device. I only got to see it in action once in the IIT Roorkee\nworkshop, and all I know is that it's the closest thing to StreetComplete or\nVespucci on iOS.)\n\n### Old advice and new realizations\n\nRemember when I said I may change my approach radically? Just a week ago, I\nwould have advised -\n\n> New mappers should start editing with Organic Maps. This gives them one easy\n> app for both using and editing OSM.\n>\n> Those who outgrow Organic Maps can progress to OsmAnd, Every Door,\n> StreetComplete, and (for the most experienced ones) Vespucci/Go Map!!\n>\n> You can also host an indoor party to teach iD.\n\nOrganic Maps also adds your contributed POIs to its local map, which is cool -\nyou can use your own changes right away.\n\nThat said, user uknown-gryphus also points out that\n\n> [...] Organic Maps can be very confusing if you updated the buildings and\n> street network just before the mapping party. In Bengaluru we've had great\n> success with EveryDoor. Field Papers were also a lot of fun but a little\n> confusing for beginners.\n\nRecently, however, I realized that StreetComplete, iD, Vespucci, Go Map!! and\nEvery Door may be much more fun to work with than Organic Maps and OsmAnd.\nThus, by not introducing them to newcomers, I may be giving them a bad\nimpression of OSM editing, and preventing the entry of new regular\ncontributors.\n\n### StreetComplete\n\nStreetComplete gamifies OpenStreetMap contribution with its quests, scores,\nand achievements. Its icons and pictorial answers add visual interest. The\nwide variety of quests prevent editing from becoming monotonous.\n\nStreetComplete is not limited to just editing existing data, either. The\nPlaces and Things overlays allow users to add shops, amenities, etc, and the\naddress overlay allows users to add addresses even when there aren't any\nbuildings.\n\nThat said, StreetComplete may not be suitable for all kinds of mapping\nparties. When you use StreetComplete, what you add is determined by what\nquests are selectable. The app dictates what you map, not the other way round.\n\nThat's good if your mapping party has no specific mapping goals in mind. In\nsuch cases, SC also has a nice team mode which divides quests among mappers\nworking in the same area.\n\nBut this aspect is not useful for the kind of mapping parties we hold, where\nwe want to exhaustively cover a specific set of features within an hour of\nsurveying. ^7 In my parties, I ask people to map shops/eateries (and their\ndetails), building addresses, and building levels (for those cool 3D\nbuildings). So while we may mention it, it's not our primary choice for a\nmapping party editor.\n\n### iD, Vespucci, and Go Map!!\n\niD, Vespucci, and Go Map!! allow users to draw ways. This is a lot like\ndrawing (as in illustrating), which most people enjoy - there's something very\nsatisfying about tracing roads, buildings, feature boundaries, etc, getting\nthem just right, and admiring your handiwork.\n\nThat could be much more fun than contributing with Organic Maps or OsmAnd,\nwhich have the simpler but less interesting process of \"add nodes and fill\nforms\".\n\niD/Vespucci sessions can take many forms -\n\n  * indoors or outdoors\n  * remote mapping - in participants' neighborhoods, or in unmapped areas\n  * walking around and creating OSM notes (or writing in Field Papers), then regrouping to edit from them (this lets you inspect everyone's edits and provide feedback faster)\n\nFigure 1: Sahil teaching iD at our recent indoor mapping party at SFLC.in\n\nAnd of course you can also do mobile mapping sessions with Vespucci, focusing\non one feature type per session to keep complexity down, e.g. -\n\n  1. shops, eateries, and amenities as tagged nodes\n  2. buildings (possibly with building details and addresses) as tagged nodes\n  3. building as areas\n  4. roads\n\n### Vespucci? Really?\n\nEven though I use Vespucci for almost all my editing, I had my doubts about\nteaching it to newcomers. Many regular contributors find it difficult to get\nstarted with. It took me a few false starts myself, and it certainly has its\nrough edges.\n\nBut we must remember is that most of us who struggled to learn it (and\nsometimes succeeded) did not have the help of a teacher. As teachers, it's our\njob to craft a good learning experience - we can flatten steep learning\ncurves, soften rough edges, and move stumbling blocks out of the way.\n\nSimon Poole (the current lead developer of Vespucci) provided another\ninteresting perspective. In response to my question -\n\n> Has anybody tried introducing Vespucci to complete OSM newbies? What was\n> your experience like? Or is it a Very Bad IdeaTM?\n\nHe said^8 I've edited it a bit. The emphasis is mine. -\n\n> That is something that needs a multi-page-essay as an answer. But\n> essentially the question is whether you want largest possible numbers, or\n> long-term engagement.\n>\n> Vespucci isn't geared towards beginners in the sense that it assumes you\n> know your way around OSM data at least a bit. [...] So you would need to\n> cover those basics in an introduction.\n>\n> But in general, just because something isn't straightforward doesn't mean it\n> affects long-term engagement. If anything, it is the other way around - that\n> is, learning a skill will drive engagement, and not having to learn anything\n> will lead to disinterest.\n\n### Organic Maps is still important\n\nThat said, I think the \"using the map motivates you to contribute\" factor is\nalso important.\n\nSo I would definitely still introduce Organic Maps to newcomers, mentioning\nits benefits (works offline, no account needed, no ads, no tracking, free\nsoftware, and you can improve the map directly ^9 Rather than submitting\nsuggestions to Google Maps and waiting for days, weeks, or months for them to\nbe approved by whatever opaque approval system they use. ), and then focus on\ndedicated editors.\n\nI don't \"install and walk-through\" OsmAnd these days - rather, I mention it as\nan option for power users, along with why they may want to try it, e.g. -\n\n  * hourly incremental updates\n  * GPS track recording\n  * multi-modal PT routing, especially share taxi routing,\n  * aerial imagery\n  * rendering of details like road surface, road smoothness, road access restrictions, locked gates, street lighting, etc\n  * showing photos from Wikimedia Commons, etc.\n\nPower users can then explore OsmAnd by themselves at home. (Thanks to Sahil\nfor this insight.)\n\n### Every Door - our choice\n\nI haven't discussed Every Door yet, which the Bangalore community often uses\nand recommends. The advantages I see are -\n\n  1. It works on both Android and iOS. ^10 StreetComplete is only available on Android, although an iOS version is in the works. The OSM wiki for SC mentions that Go Maps!! supports StreetComplete quests, which may work as a workaround.\n  2. It's not a full-fledged editor like Vespucci/iD/Go Map!!, so the interface is simpler, it's easier to learn, and new editors can't mess up ways or geometries.\n  3. It's the only \"simple\" mobile editor that can add building nodes with building details. If you want a 3D map of a neighbourhood, teach Every Door to the participants, and ask them to map building:levels. ^11 You can achieve this with StreetComplete by enabling the building levels quest, but somebody has to trace the buildings in the area in advance.\n  4. It's the only \"simple\" mobile editor which can use aerial imagery out of the box. ^12 Satellite imagery in OsmAnd needs some setup. In Vespucci, it requires dealing with the powerful-but-complex layer system. (The need for setup has hopefully been reduced with Vespucci v20's new introduction dialogue, which offers to enable satellite imagery.) StreetComplete and Organic Maps don't support aerial imagery at all.\n  5. It has some unique interfaces that can make life easier -\n\n    1. When you add a certain feature, it auto-applies the key-values you used for the last instance of that feature. This is unique to Every Door (as far as I know) and often speeds up editing significantly.\n    2. It has an easy interface for adding directions to e.g. surveillance cameras, which I haven't seen in any other editor. (Which is why I switch to Every Door for adding surveillance cameras.)\n  6. It generates changeset comments for you, so you can upload frequently without breaking your flow.\n  7. It may provide more long-term engagement than editing in Organic Maps and OsmAnd, because of the satellite imagery, different modes, more operations and feature types, and richer forms.\n\nThere are some downsides, though -\n\n  1. There's no compass, which makes it harder to know where to place new data.\n  2. You can rotate the map, but there's no indication that the map has been rotated, nor any way to reset it.\n\nThere's a workaround for this, but it's clunky - switch back to OSM tiles and\nget them the right way up. It snaps into the north-side-up orientation and\nresists rotation there - that's all the indication you currently get.\n\n  3. It does not support addr:block, addr:suburb, and addr:neighbourhood, which makes it problematic for Indian addresses - unless your first-time mappers have no issue with adding tags manually, but that brings the editing experience to OsmAnd levels of raw key-value drudgery.\n\nThe best workarounds I can think of are -\n\n    1. leave address mapping to somewhat experienced editors\n    2. let new editors add addresses as notes; someone can add the data later\n  4. There's no dark mode.\n\nIf you are not careful of the first two, you can get thrown off and make\nmistakes in editing. I saw this happen when we used it at our IndiaFOSS\nworkshop.\n\nDespite those flaws, Every Door currently seems to be the best option for us,\nand has been our mainstay for the last few mobile mapping parties.\n\n### openstreetmap.org\n\nThe website is an important resource to mention, so users can see their edit\nhistory, find nearby mappers, see how their changeset comments are used, how\nto respond to changeset discussions, etc.\n\nYou could demonstrate it at the end of the survey by asking everyone to check\nout their changes on the website, while also reviewing their changes and\ndiscussing mistakes.\n\n## Epilogue\n\nThat's all I have for now. I hope your mapping parties succeed in growing\nOpenStreetMap's community and data coverage. Happy mapping [party organizing]!\n\n", "frontpage": true}
