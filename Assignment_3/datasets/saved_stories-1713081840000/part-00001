We love all the free services out there, but it would be good to\nkeep it on topic. It's a grey line sometimes, so this is opinionated; please\ndon't feel offended if I don't accept your contribution.\n\nThis list results from Pull Requests, reviews, ideas, and work done by 1100+\npeople. You can also help by sending Pull Requests to add more services or\nremove ones whose offerings have changed or been retired.\n\nNOTE: This list is only for as-a-Service offerings, not for self-hosted\nsoftware. To be eligible, a service must offer a free tier, not just a free\ntrial. The free tier must be for at least a year if it is time-bucketed. We\nalso consider the free tier from a security perspective, so SSO is fine, but I\nwill not accept services that restrict TLS to paid-only tiers.\n\n# Table of Contents\n\n  * Major Cloud Providers' Always-Free Limits\n  * Cloud management solutions\n  * Analytics, Events, and Statistics\n  * APIs, Data and ML\n  * Artifact Repos\n  * BaaS\n  * Low-code Platform\n  * CDN and Protection\n  * CI and CD\n  * CMS\n  * Code Generation\n  * Code Quality\n  * Code Search and Browsing\n  * Crash and Exception Handling\n  * Data Visualization on Maps\n  * Managed Data Services\n  * Design and UI\n  * Design Inspiration\n  * Dev Blogging Sites\n  * DNS\n  * Docker Related\n  * Domain\n  * Education and Career Development\n  * Email\n  * Feature Toggles Management Platforms\n  * Font\n  * Forms\n  * Generative AI\n  * IaaS\n  * IDE and Code Editing\n  * International Mobile Number Verification API and SDK\n  * Issue Tracking and Project Management\n  * Log Management\n  * Mobile App Distribution and Feedback\n  * Management Systems\n  * Messaging and Streaming\n  * Miscellaneous\n  * Monitoring\n  * PaaS\n  * Package Build System\n  * Payment and Billing Integration\n  * Privacy Management\n  * Screenshot APIs\n  * Flutter Related and Building IOS Apps without Mac\n  * Search\n  * Security and PKI\n  * Authentication, Authorization, and User Management\n  * Source Code Repos\n  * Storage and Media Processing\n  * Tunneling, WebRTC, Web Socket Servers and Other Routers\n  * Testing\n  * Tools for Teams and Collaboration\n  * Translation Management\n  * Vagrant Related\n  * Visitor Session Recording\n  * Web Hosting\n  * Commenting Platforms\n  * Browser based hardware emulation\n  * Remote Desktop Tools\n  * Game Development\n  * Other Free Resources\n\n## Major Cloud Providers\n\n  * Google Cloud Platform\n\n    * App Engine - 28 frontend instance hours per day, nine backend instance hours per day\n    * Cloud Firestore - 1GB storage, 50,000 reads, 20,000 writes, 20,000 deletes per day\n    * Compute Engine - 1 non-preemptible e2-micro, 30GB HDD, 5GB snapshot storage (restricted to certain regions), 1 GB network egress from North America to all region destinations (excluding China and Australia) per month\n    * Cloud Storage - 5GB, 1GB network egress\n    * Cloud Shell - Web-based Linux shell/primary IDE with 5GB of persistent storage. 60 hours limit per week\n    * Cloud Pub/Sub - 10GB of messages per month\n    * Cloud Functions - 2 million invocations per month (includes both background and HTTP invocations)\n    * Cloud Run - 2 million requests per month, 360,000 GB-seconds memory, 180,000 vCPU-seconds of compute time, 1 GB network egress from North America per month\n    * Google Kubernetes Engine - No cluster management fee for one zonal cluster.
