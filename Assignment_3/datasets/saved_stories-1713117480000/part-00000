Until recently, if I wish\nto do some programming in a coffee shop or during a family trip, my only\noptions are the corporate-provisioned MacBook or my iPad Pro 2020, neither of\nwhich is ideal. I had hoped the iPad Pro could be more productive and tried\nvarious setups involving code-server and remote development, but I encountered\nmany limitations. Furthermore, the fact that Apple has restricted iPadOS,\npreventing me from installing any software I want, has become increasingly\nuncomfortable for me in light of the recent Digital Markets Act and antitrust\ndiscussions.\n\nI adore the form factor of the iPad Pro as a travel computer, and the concept\nof a MacPad is indeed extraordinary. However, I\u2019m hesitant to invest\nsignificant time and money into a custom product that might not have the bless\nof its manufacturer. Additionally, memories of the Microsoft Surface have\nresurfaced. I owned a Surface 3 many years ago but sold it due to its\nperformance not meeting my needs, eventually replacing it with a Hades Canyon\nmini PC.\n\nAs I\u2019ve become more immersed in Linux, both through my Homelab VMs and my\ndesktop PC, the idea of owning a portable Linux device appeals to me. However,\nI must confess that I\u2019m not fond of the design of most mainstream non-Apple\nlaptops, and Linux-friendly laptop brands like Framework, System76, and\nStarlabs are not yet available in my region. I\u2019ve experimented with Asahi\nLinux on my iMac, and while it offers a generally great experience, the ARM\nLinux ecosystem, especially with 16K pages, doesn\u2019t quite meet my daily needs.\n\nUltimately, I\u2019m in search of a Surface-like device that offers good\nperformance, runs Linux well, and is ultraportable. Although the Surface Pro\n10 was released just as I began my search, Microsoft\u2019s pricing\nstrategy\u2014essentially doubling the price of the whole device for adequate RAM\nand SSD\u2014is unacceptable to me. It seems Microsoft has taken the wrong lessons\nfrom Apple in this regard, and I believe such pricing strategies should be\nconsidered unethical.\n\n## Discovering the V3 Tablet\n\nDuring my search, I discovered an intriguing product from Minisforum, a\nmanufacturer renowned for creating NUC-like mini PCs, which has gained\npopularity within the Homelab community. The tablet, named \u201cV3,\u201d has been in\ndevelopment for over a year. Initially, it was developed by another\nmanufacturer with an AMD Ryzen 7 6800U processor. Later, Minisforum took over\nthe project, replacing the processor first with the 7840U, and ultimately with\nthe 8840U in the final product.\n\nThe tablet features a 14\" 2.5K 165Hz P3 color touch screen, a 50.82Wh battery,\nfour speakers, front and rear cameras, and face and fingerprint unlocking,\nalong with two USB4 ports. Surprisingly, it also features a USB-C port labeled\n\u201cVLink\u201d or \u201cDP-in,\u201d enabling the tablet to function as an external display for\nother devices. This is a feature I\u2019ve long believed should be standard on all\nscreens and regret its absence in recent iMacs. My curiosity was piqued about\nhow Linux would perform on this device.\n\nThe tablet was released on March 29 locally, and its price was set at 6999 CNY\n(~968 USD) for the configuration with 32GB DDR5 RAM and a 1TB SSD\u2014a price\npoint I consider quite reasonable. Early buyers were offered a keyboard case\nat no extra cost and had the opportunity to purchase the MPP 2.0 stylus for\njust 200 CNY (~28 USD). Moreover, it was mentioned that Linux runs on this\ntablet, with support for Ubuntu 22.04 and 23.10, albeit with \u201conly a few minor\nissues\u201d that are currently being addressed. I placed my order on day one and\nhave been playing with it over the past few weeks.\n\n## Initial Experience\n\nMy first impressions of the V3 tablet were less than ideal, primarily due to\nMinisforum\u2019s approach to selling and shipping the initial units. Although the\nkickstand and keyboard case were offered for free to early buyers, there was a\ncatch: they were shipped after leaving a review on the online retailer JD. The\nabsence of both the kickstand and the keyboard significantly detracted from\nthe user experience. Additionally, a bug in Windows 11 prevented me from\ncreating a PIN code to complete the setup, a problem that could only be\nresolved by connecting a USB keyboard. Placing the tablet on a table without\nthe kickstand led to the air opening on the back being covered, which is far\nfrom ideal for airflow.\n\nI believe that shipping the free kickstand and keyboard with the tablet would\nlead to more positive reviews by significantly improving initial customer\nsatisfaction. I hope global customers won\u2019t have to wait for the kickstand,\nkeyboard, and stylus to be shipped separately, as international shipping could\nadd to the frustration.\n\nThe V3 tablet comes with Windows 11 Pro, a detail I find quite welcoming, even\nI primarily intend to use Linux desktop on this device, as most laptops in\nthis price range only come with the Home edition of Windows. The Pro edition\ngrants users more control over BitLocker encryption, which is crucial for a\nportable device. Additionally, Hyper-V is important for those who need to\ninstall VMs on Windows.\n\nThe screen\u2019s color and brightness are exceptional. Initially, I didn\u2019t\nanticipate the 165Hz refresh rate to be a significant feature for this tablet,\nassuming that most games would struggle to run at 2K on the integrated GPU and\nthat I didn\u2019t have any videos exceeding 60Hz to watch. However, the difference\nin UI smoothness between 60Hz and 165Hz is stark, making it hard for me to\nrevert to the lower refresh rate.\n\nIt\u2019s somewhat disappointing that the tablet\u2019s resolution is only 2.5K; at this\nscreen size, I believe 2.8K or 3K would be optimal for 200% integer scaling.\nNonetheless, given that KDE and Wayland now adequately support fractional\nscaling at 175% and the AMD GPU has good Wayland compatibility, this\nresolution is acceptable. Consequently, content on the V3 tablet appears as\nsharp as on MacBooks other than 14 and 16 inch MacBook Pro, which has 254\npixels per inch.\n\n## Linux on the Device\n\nUnlike my desktop PC, which runs EndeavourOS, I chose Fedora KDE for this\ntablet. My preference for Fedora stems from its relatively newer kernel and\ndesktop environment, as well as its out-of-the-box support for secure boot.\nThe latter is particularly crucial for a portable computer, allowing me to\nenable full disk encryption and set up automatic decryption via TPM with\nsystemd-cryptsetup. My choice to stick with KDE was primarily due to its\nexcellent support for scaling Xwayland applications. Although many GTK4 apps\nappeal to me\u2014and I can still use them within KDE\u2014GNOME has continued to refuse\nto address the issue of Xwayland apps appearing blurry on HiDPI displays.\n\nI was concerned about hardware support on Linux, but my experience turned out\nto be reassuring. The touchscreen, keyboard, touchpad, Wi-Fi, USB, Bluetooth\nand suspend/sleep all work without any issues. It\u2019s surprising that the\nfingerprint reader on the power button works right out of the box. After\nadding my fingerprint in KDE settings, not only can I use it on the lock\nscreen, but I can also use my fingerprint to unlock sudo commands in Konsole\nwith no extra setup. Both the front-facing and back cameras work well. I\ndidn\u2019t try face unlocking because I actually prefer using touch over face\nrecognition.\n\nMost apps I installed on V3 are similar to those on my desktop PC, only I use\ndnf instead of pacman. I don\u2019t need to configure Wayland for Chromium and\nElectron apps, as Xwayland performs well with an AMD GPU. I couldn\u2019t get\nTimeshift working with a btrfs filesystem inside a LUKS partition, so I\nswitched to btrfs-assistant and snapper for automatically creating snapshots.\n\nEnabling hardware acceleration for video playback in Fedora is somewhat weird.\nI need to add the RPMFusion repository and switch from mesa-va-drivers to\nmesa-va-drivers-freeworld to enable H.264 and HEVC hardware decoding, due to\nsome absurd patent law issues.\n\n## Using the V3 as a Linux Tablet\n\nUsing Linux with a touchscreen is as good as using Windows. I\u2019ve used the\ndesktop mode on the Steam Deck, and all the gestures are familiar. KDE has a\n\u201ctablet mode\u201d that enlarges the taskbar icons and many UI elements when I\ndetach the keyboard, making it easier to tap.\n\nThe stylus is well-supported on Linux. Hover and pen pressure functionalities\nwork great in apps like Krita and Xournal++. It\u2019s a pleasure to take\nhandwritten notes and annotate PDFs on this tablet, especially with the 165Hz\nrefresh rate. Using the stylus makes selecting text and navigating the UI\neasier than using my finger.\n\nThe on-screen keyboard is a bit tricky here. Both Fcitx5 and Maliit use the\nvirtual keyboard protocol on KDE Wayland. When the keyboard is attached, I use\nFcitx5 for inputting Chinese or Japanese texts, and when detached, I switch to\nMaliit for the on-screen keyboard. I haven\u2019t found a way to automatically\nswitch between these two, but I believe it\u2019s possible. Maliit supports\nmultiple languages and can be configured with gsettings set\norg.maliit.keyboard.maliit enabled-languages \"['en', 'zh-hans', 'ja',\n'emoji']\".\n\nI use Waydroid to run Android apps on the V3 tablet, with support for Google\nPlay and arm translation. Some apps, like Google Play Books and Pocket Casts,\nwork great. However, the performance and experience don\u2019t compare to a native\nAndroid tablet. I considered using Microsoft OneNote as a cross-platform tool\nfor my handwritten notes, but there\u2019s a major issue with OneNote for Android\non Waydroid\u2014the handwriting doesn\u2019t appear on the screen until I lift the\nstylus, touchpad, or finger. Another issue is video playback; while I have\nhardware acceleration in Linux apps like Firefox, mpv, and VLC, Android apps\ncan only decode videos with the CPU, leading to worse battery life. Cameras do\nnot work on Waydroid either.\n\nOne functionality missing in Linux on the V3 is automatic rotation. I have\niio-sensor-proxy installed, and KDE Wayland should support automatic rotation\nout of the box. However, monitor-sensors reports there is no accelerometer. I\nhope Minisforum can address this issue with a driver or firmware update, or at\nleast provide a DKMS module.\n\nAnother minor issue is that the volume keys on the side of the tablet only\nwork when the keyboard is attached in Linux. I suspect this is a userland\nproblem.\n\n## Performance and Battery Life\n\nThe performance of the AMD Ryzen 7 8840U is outstanding. It outperforms my M1\niMac in tasks such as building Android apps and the 7z b benchmark. Its\nsingle-core performance surpasses that of my Core i7 12700 homelab PC, though\nthe 12700 only performs better in multi-core tasks because it has four more\nE-cores. I haven\u2019t conducted extensive benchmarks, and I haven\u2019t yet managed\nto get Handbrake working with AMD VCN on Linux to test its hardware-\naccelerated video encoding speed. However, the KDE UI and most applications\nfeel as fast as my Dragon Canyon desktop PC equipped with an RTX 3080. In some\ncases, it feels even snappier, due to the ongoing issues between NVIDIA and\nWayland, which are expected to be resolved very soon.\n\nDuring my normal usage in Linux, which includes web browsing with Firefox,\nvideo playback with Haruna Media Player (with hwdec set to auto), writing in\nObsidian, and lightweight coding in Visual Studio Code and Android Studio, the\ntablet lasts for 6 hours. The battery life is not as long as that of Apple\nSilicon MacBooks but it is satisfactory to me and better than what I remember\nfrom using Intel MacBooks. The battery life might vary with Windows,\npotentially achieving longer duration.\n\nGaming on this tablet delivers performance in line with what you would expect\nfrom the Radeon 780M integrated GPU. I\u2019ve tested it with two recent games I\u2019m\nplaying. I can play Persona 3 Reload at high settings (though with Ray-Traced\nReflections disabled) at 1200p and 60fps. For Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth,\nI achieve 55 to 60 fps at high settings (with FSR set to optimize for frame\nrate) in 1200p. Both games perform much better than on the Steam Deck. The\nframe rate only drops slightly when reducing the TDP from 28W to 15W,\nshowcasing the efficiency of the GPU under varied power conditions.\n\nThe tablet is marketed as an \u201cAI PC,\u201d due to the AMD Ryzen 7 8840U processor,\nwhich features an XDNA NPU, and a keyboard equipped with a Copilot key. While\nlocal Large Language Models like Llama 2 perform rapidly and effectively using\nplatforms like ollama and LM Studio, I believe these currently run on the CPU.\nAs of now, I am not aware of any AI products specifically utilizing the NPU,\nbut AMD does provide some tutorials which might hint at future developments\nthat could leverage the NPU for enhanced AI performance.\n\n## Working as an Portable Display\n\nThe external display feature of the V3 tablet, which makes it a \u201c3 in 1\u201d\ndevice, is unique. Although this feature is still in its early stages based on\nmy testing, I believe it represents a promising start.\n\nThe VLink USB-C port only operates when the computer part of the tablet is\nshut down. Unfortunately, there appear to be compatibility issues, as it\ndoesn\u2019t work with my M1 Macs using a USB-C cable. I tried two cables that\nfunction with my Mac and the LG UL850 display, but neither could activate the\nV3\u2019s display. However, it worked fine when connected to my desktop PC. I\nsuspect that the issue might be resolved by using a USB-C to DisplayPort\ndongle and a DisplayPort to USB-C cable, but this solution is too cumbersome.\nI hope a firmware update can resolve this issue.\n\nWhen used as an external display, the keyboard case can also function as an\nexternal USB keyboard. This is particularly useful in setups where I want to\nconfigure a NAS or mini PC for eventual headless operation. However, it seems\nthe V3 only supports a 60Hz refresh rate when used as an external display, and\nI\u2019m not sure if this is due to compatibility or cable issues.\n\nAnother feature I hope to see improved in the future is the ability to turn on\nthe Nintendo Switch\u2019s TV mode with just one USB-C cable. I understand that\nNintendo doesn\u2019t use standard display protocols, making this a challenging\nfeature to implement. However, I\u2019m aware of portable displays that support\nthis feature. It would be incredibly valuable for travel with the Nintendo\nSwitch, and I would be willing to pay extra for this capability.\n\n## Other Hardware Details\n\nThe form factor of the V3 tablet is similar to a Microsoft Surface Pro,\nespecially when the keyboard is attached. However, the kickstand is separate\nfrom the tablet, which makes the entire setup slightly heavier. I prefer the\nintegrated kickstand design of the Microsoft Surface and Nintendo Switch OLED,\nbut the separate kickstand does provide a wider range of angles.\n\nThe tablet is completely sealed with no visible screws for opening, which\nraises concerns about long-term repairability, especially if the cooling\nsystem degrades over time. While a 1TB SSD is sufficient for my needs with\nthis device, it would be beneficial for users who require more storage if it\ncan replace the NVMe drive.\n\nThe speaker is loud and good, but there seems to be an issue with volume\ncontrol in Linux. The global volume control can only mute or unmute the\nspeaker, while the actual volume is controlled at the application level. I\nsuspect there might be some driver issues, as when I use headphones, both the\nglobal and application level volume controls work well.\n\nThe keyboard case is quite pleasant to use. While I might still prefer the\nfeel of the Magic Keyboard, this one comes close. The key layout feels just\nright. I particularly appreciate that the keyboard includes dedicated Home, Pg\nUp, Pg Dn, and End keys on the right side. This is especially useful to me, as\nI\u2019m primarily familiar with macOS/Emacs shortcuts for these commands, which\nare not supported in Linux except within the terminal.\n\nThe fan noise is a mixed bag for me. During the day, even under heavy\nworkloads, I can barely hear the fan. However, at midnight, when my room is\ncompletely silent, I can often hear a strange, faint buzzing noise coming from\nthe tablet. This noise disappears when I run benchmarks or play games that\nmaximize the fan speed. It\u2019s not like the typical fan noise but resembles the\nsound of an HDD, though at a much lower volume. It seems this noise might be\ncaused by the fan frequently changing speeds or being affected by the magnets\nin the tablet. I\u2019d be interested to hear if others have experienced this\nissue, and if it turns out to be unique to my unit or an early production\nissue, I\u2019ll replace it under warranty.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAfter two weeks of use, I consider the Minisforum V3 AMD Tablet to be a nearly\nperfect portable Linux device. It offers a promising blend of performance,\nversatility, and Linux compatibility at an acceptable price point. This tablet\nis an excellent start for tablets featuring AMD APUs and those that triple as\nexternal displays. However, I hope that the minor issues I\u2019ve mentioned can be\naddressed, either through firmware updates or in the next iteration of the\nproduct. I also wish for some level of repairability, such as the ability for\nusers to open the case to clean the fans or replace the NVMe drive. Looking\nahead, I plan to bring the V3 tablet along for travel and weekends in coffee\nshops.\n\nWelcome to my other publishing channels\n\nRSS\n\nNotes on EndeavourOS\n\n\u00a9 2024 Mudkip\n\nPowered by Hexo & NexT.Mist\n\n0%\n\n", "frontpage": false}
