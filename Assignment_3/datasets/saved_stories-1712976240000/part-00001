The README and other information about the software is based on version 1.68, and is far out of date. This documentation contains anecdotes and information about algorithmic approaches in a readable form. However, the ancient versions of leptonica referred to in these pages have not been supported for a long time.\n  * Uncompleted sets of somewhat detailed usage notes and a lightweight overview have been attempted but are unlikely to be completed anytime in the current millenium.\n  * The final arbiter is, of course, the source itself.\n\n## Source download\n\n###\n\n  * Click here to download the source. [ update: Jan 3, 2024 ]\n  * See here for further information about the source code.\n\n## Fun stuff\n\n###\n\n  1. What is the origin of the name Leptonica?\n\n  2. Image processing at this site [ update: Jan 3, 2024 ]\n\n  3. Some issues in software design\n\n  4. A primer on particle physics\n\n  5. A small collection of interesting links\n\n  6. Broadband for Dummies: a primer for safely using the internet with windows\n\n##\n\nContact: Dan Bloomberg (bloomberg \"at\" ieee \"dot\" org) for questions and\nsuggestions\n\nThis documentation is licensed by Dan Bloomberg under a Creative Commons\nAttribution 3.0 United States License.\n\n### \u00a9 Copyright 2001-2023, Leptonica\n\n", "frontpage": false}
