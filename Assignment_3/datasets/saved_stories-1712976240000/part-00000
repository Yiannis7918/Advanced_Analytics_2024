Not only is it written in Janet, but site authors construct\nsites by writing ordinary Janet modules, with the full power of the language\nand ecosystem behind them:\n\n    \n    \n    (def data {:config {:attrs {:title \"A Demo Bagatto Config\"}} :posts {:src (bagatto/slurp-* \"posts/*.md\") :attrs parse-post} :static {:src (bagatto/* \"static/*\") :attrs bagatto/parse-base} :config-json {:src \"config.json\" :attrs bagatto/parse-json} :config-file {:src \"config.jdn\"}})\n    \n    \n    (def site {:post-index {:dest index-path :out render-post-index} :posts {:each :posts :dest make-post-path :out render-post} :static {:each :static :dest make-static-path}})\n\n#### Transparent\n\nBagatto exposes the native terms of the Janet programming language to site\nauthors and relies on ordinary functions to generate output values. This\napproach, rather than asking authors to define their sites using a\nconfiguration language, means that the machinery that produces your website is\nalways available and inspectable. There is no hidden functionality.\n\n#### No Magic\n\nBagatto will never do something in an indirect, non-obvious way in the name of\nconvenience. Things like normally-namespaced functions, accepting a filename\non the command line, and compatibility with jpm are examples of how a\nstraightforward, non-magic interface can be elegant and enjoyable.\n\n#### Fast\n\nBagatto is surprisingly fast. It makes intelligent use of multithreading and\ncaching to quickly process files with many different sources and outputs, and\nthere\u2019s no start-up overhead.\n\nZ. D. Smith, Brooklyn, 2021\n\nBuilt with Bagatto.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
