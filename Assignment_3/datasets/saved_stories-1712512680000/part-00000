For instance, a mass spectrometer can measure\nhormone levels in the blood of someone with hypothyroidism.\n\nBut mass spectrometers can cost several hundred thousand dollars, so these\nexpensive machines are typically confined to laboratories where blood samples\nmust be sent for testing. This inefficient process can make managing a chronic\ndisease especially challenging.\n\n\u201cOur big vision is to make mass spectrometry local. For someone who has a\nchronic disease that requires constant monitoring, they could have something\nthe size of a shoebox that they could use to do this test at home. For that to\nhappen, the hardware has to be inexpensive,\u201d says Luis Fernando Vel\u00e1squez-\nGarc\u00eda, a principal research scientist in MIT\u2019s Microsystems Technology\nLaboratories (MTL).\n\nHe and his collaborators have taken a big step in that direction by 3D\nprinting a low-cost ionizer \u2014 a critical component of all mass spectrometers \u2014\nthat performs twice as well as its state-of-the-art counterparts.\n\nTheir device, which is only a few centimeters in size, can be manufactured at\nscale in batches and then incorporated into a mass spectrometer using\nefficient, pick-and-place robotic assembly methods. Such mass production would\nmake it cheaper than typical ionizers that often require manual labor, need\nexpensive hardware to interface with the mass spectrometer, or must be built\nin a semiconductor clean room.\n\nBy 3D printing the device instead, the researchers were able to precisely\ncontrol its shape and utilize special materials that helped boost its\nperformance.\n\n\u201cThis is a do-it-yourself approach to making an ionizer, but it is not a\ncontraption held together with duct tape or a poor man\u2019s version of the\ndevice. At the end of the day, it works better than devices made using\nexpensive processes and specialized instruments, and anyone can be empowered\nto make it,\u201d says Vel\u00e1squez-Garc\u00eda, senior author of a paper on the ionizer.\n\nHe wrote the paper with lead author Alex Kachkine, a mechanical engineering\ngraduate student. The research is published in the Journal of the American\nAssociation for Mass Spectrometry.\n\nLow-cost hardware\n\nMass spectrometers identify the contents of a sample by sorting charged\nparticles, called ions, based on their mass-to-charge ratio. Since molecules\nin blood don\u2019t have an electric charge, an ionizer is used to give them a\ncharge before they are analyzed.\n\nMost liquid ionizers do this using electrospray, which involves applying a\nhigh voltage to a liquid sample and then firing a thin jet of charged\nparticles into the mass spectrometer. The more ionized particles in the spray,\nthe more accurate the measurements will be.\n\nThe MIT researchers used 3D printing, along with some clever optimizations, to\nproduce a low-cost electrospray emitter that outperformed state-of-the-art\nmass spectrometry ionizer versions.\n\nThey fabricated the emitter from metal using binder jetting, a 3D printing\nprocess in which a blanket of powdered material is showered with a polymer-\nbased glue squirted through tiny nozzles to build an object layer by layer.\nThe finished object is heated in an oven to evaporate the glue and then\nconsolidate the object from a bed of powder that surrounds it.\n\n\u201cThe process sounds complicated, but it is one of the original 3D printing\nmethods, and it is highly precise and very effective,\u201d Vel\u00e1squez-Garc\u00eda says.\n\nThen, the printed emitters undergo an electropolishing step that sharpens it.\nFinally, each device is coated in zinc oxide nanowires which give the emitter\na level of porosity that enables it to effectively filter and transport\nliquids.\n\nThinking outside the box\n\nOne possible problem that impacts electrospray emitters is the evaporation\nthat can occur to the liquid sample during operation. The solvent might\nvaporize and clog the emitter, so engineers typically design emitters to limit\nevaporation.\n\nThrough modeling confirmed by experiments, the MIT team realized they could\nuse evaporation to their advantage. They designed the emitters as externally-\nfed solid cones with a specific angle that leverages evaporation to\nstrategically restrict the flow of liquid. In this way, the sample spray\ncontains a higher ratio of charge-carrying molecules.\n\n\u201cWe saw that evaporation can actually be a design knob that can help you\noptimize the performance,\u201d he says.\n\nThey also rethought the counter-electrode that applies voltage to the sample.\nThe team optimized its size and shape, using the same binder jetting method,\nso the electrode prevents arcing. Arcing, which occurs when electrical current\njumps a gap between two electrodes, can damage electrodes or cause\noverheating.\n\nBecause their electrode is not prone to arcing, they can safely increase the\napplied voltage, which results in more ionized molecules and better\nperformance.\n\nThey also created a low-cost, printed circuit board with built-in digital\nmicrofluidics, which the emitter is soldered to. The addition of digital\nmicrofluidics enables the ionizer to efficiently transport droplets of liquid.\n\nTaken together, these optimizations enabled an electrospray emitter that could\noperate at a voltage 24 percent higher than state-of-the-art versions. This\nhigher voltage enabled their device to more than double the signal-to-noise\nratio.\n\nIn addition, their batch processing technique could be implemented at scale,\nwhich would significantly lower the cost of each emitter and go a long way\ntoward making a point-of-care mass spectrometer an affordable reality.\n\n\u201cGoing back to Guttenberg, once people had the ability to print their own\nthings, the world changed completely. In a sense, this could be more of the\nsame. We can give people the power to create the hardware they need in their\ndaily lives,\u201d he says.\n\nMoving forward, the team wants to create a prototype that combines their\nionizer with a 3D-printed mass filter they previously developed. The ionizer\nand mass filter are the key components of the device. They are also working to\nperfect 3D-printed vacuum pumps, which remain a major hurdle to printing an\nentire compact mass spectrometer.\n\n\u201cMiniaturization through advanced technology is slowly but surely transforming\nmass spectrometry, reducing manufacturing cost and increasing the range of\napplications. This work on fabricating electrospray sources by 3D printing\nalso enhances signal strength, increasing sensitivity and signal-to-noise\nratio and potentially opening the way to more widespread use in clinical\ndiagnosis,\u201d says Richard Syms, professor of microsystems technology in the\nDepartment of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Imperial College\nLondon, who was not involved with this research.\n\nThis work was supported by Empiriko Corporation.\n\n### Share this news article on:\n\n  * X\n  * Facebook\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Reddit\n  * Print\n\n## Paper\n\nPaper: \u201cHigh-Performance, Low-Cost, Additively Manufactured Electrospray Ion\nSources for Mass Spectrometry\u201d\n\n## Related Links\n\n  * Luis Fernando Vel\u00e1squez-Garc\u00eda\n  * Microsystems Technology Laboratories\n  * Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science\n  * School of Engineering\n  * MIT Schwarzman College of Computing\n\n## Related Topics\n\n  * Research\n  * 3-D printing\n  * Additive manufacturing\n  * Electronics\n  * Diagnostics\n  * Medical devices\n  * Health care\n  * Microsystems Technology Laboratories\n  * Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (eecs)\n  * School of Engineering\n  * MIT Schwarzman College of Computing\n\n## Related Articles\n\n### MIT engineers 3D print the electromagnets at the heart of many electronics\n\n### Researchers 3D print components for a portable mass spectrometer\n\n### Scientists 3D print self-heating microfluidic devices\n\n### Researchers 3D print a miniature vacuum pump\n\n## More MIT News\n\n### For Julie Greenberg, a career of research, mentoring, and advocacy\n\nThe longtime academic leader of the Harvard-MIT Program in Health Sciences and\nTechnology reflects on her time spent guiding students at the intersection of\nmedicine and engineering.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n### Reevaluating an approach to functional brain imaging\n\nAn MRI method purported to detect neurons\u2019 rapid impulses produces its own\nmisleading signals instead, an MIT study finds.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n### Propelling atomically layered magnets toward green computers\n\nMIT scientists have tackled key obstacles to bringing 2D magnetic materials\ninto practical use, setting the stage for the next generation of energy-\nefficient computers.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n### MIT Haystack scientists prepare a constellation of instruments to observe\nthe solar eclipse\u2019s effects\n\nIn a first, four different technologies will monitor changes in the upper\natmosphere, locally and across the continent, as the sun\u2019s radiation dips.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n### Q&A: Tips for viewing the 2024 solar eclipse\n\nBrian Mernoff of the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics offers best\npractices to get the most out of your eclipse experience.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n### Unlocking new science with devices that control electric power\n\nSeron Electronics, founded by Mo Mirvakili PhD \u201917, makes research equipment\nwith applications including microelectronics, clean energy, optics,\nbiomedicine, and beyond.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n  * More news on MIT News homepage \u2192\n\n## More about MIT News at Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nThis website is managed by the MIT News Office, part of the Institute Office\nof Communications.\n\n### News by Schools/College:\n\n  * School of Architecture and Planning\n  * School of Engineering\n  * School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences\n  * MIT Sloan School of Management\n  * School of Science\n  * MIT Schwarzman College of Computing\n\n### Resources:\n\n  * About the MIT News Office\n  * MIT News Press Center\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Press Inquiries\n  * Filming Guidelines\n  * RSS Feeds\n\n### Tools:\n\n  * Subscribe to MIT Daily/Weekly\n  * Subscribe to press releases\n  * Submit campus news\n  * Guidelines for campus news contributors\n  * Guidelines on generative AI\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA,\nUSA\n\nRecommended Links:\n\n  * Visit\n  * Map (opens in new window)\n  * Events (opens in new window)\n  * People (opens in new window)\n  * Careers (opens in new window)\n  * Contact\n  * Privacy\n  * Accessibility\n  *     * Social Media Hub\n    * MIT on X\n    * MIT on Facebook\n    * MIT on YouTube\n    * MIT on Instagram\n\n", "frontpage": false}
