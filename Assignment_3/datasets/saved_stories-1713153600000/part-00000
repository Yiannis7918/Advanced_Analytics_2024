The lawsuit involves bias, H-1B\nworkers, and rehiring practices.\n\niStock\n\n### Related\n\n  * American techies accuse TCS of firing them in favour of Indians on H-1B visa\n  * Indians with pending EAD applications stand to benefit with extended validity tenure\n  * Canada extends work permit processing for H-1B visa holders who missed out due to cap\n\nRandy Devorin, a 61-year-old US citizen with over a decade of service at Tata\nConsultancy Services (TCS) in the global consulting practice, has taken legal\naction against the tech giant, alleging discriminatory employment practices.\n\nIn a lawsuit filed in a US court, Devorin claims that TCS exhibits bias\ntowards H-1B visa-holder employees of Indian/South Asian origin while\ntargeting older American workers for termination to make room for Indian\nnationals and \"freshers\". Devorin has demanded a jury trial to address these\nallegations of discrimination.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Devorin was informed in July last year that his\nteam was disbanded, and he was required to apply for a consultant role\ndirectly on an engagement. Despite his persistent efforts through emails and\napplications, Devorin's attempts did not progress beyond the initial stage. He\nbelieves that the resource management group intentionally hindered his\napplications. In contrast, a younger Indian employee swiftly secured a role\nand was offered multiple positions, none of which were extended to Devorin.\n\nby Taboola by Taboola\n\nSponsored Links Sponsored Links\n\nPromoted Links Promoted Links\n\nYou May Like\n\nForge Of Empires\n\nWenn du \u00fcber 45 Jahre alt bist, wirst du dieses Strategiespiel 2024\nliebenForge Of Empires\n\nThis lawsuit follows complaints filed by at least 22 workers with the Equal\nEmployment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) since late December, as reported by\nThe Wall Street Journal. These experienced American professionals accused TCS\nof abruptly terminating their employment and replacing them with workers from\nIndia on H-1B visas. The lawsuit highlights that out of the 14 global managing\npartners laid off, three Indian global managing partners were rehired into\ndifferent roles, while the others were not retained.\n\n(Join our ETNRI WhatsApp channel for all the latest updates)\n\nIn response to inquiries from TOI, TCS stated that it is currently in a silent\nperiod and directed TOI to its previous response, where the company refuted\nallegations of engaging in unlawful discrimination, deeming them baseless and\nmisleading.\n\nRECOMMENDEDSTORIES FOR YOU\n\nAmerican techies accuse TCS of firing them in favour of Indians on H-1B visa\n\nIndians with pending EAD applications stand to benefit with extended validity\ntenure\n\nCanada extends work permit processing for H-1B visa holders who missed out due\nto cap\n\n#### Read More News on\n\nTCStcsUS techieAmericansTCS employeesAmerican techies\n\n## Test Guide\n\n1.\n\n## Harvard, Caltech reverse course and reinstate Standardized Tests\n\n2.\n\n#### The SAT\u2019s return has frantic parents hiring $500-an-hour tutors\n\n3.\n\n#### Brown University follows MIT and Yale.
