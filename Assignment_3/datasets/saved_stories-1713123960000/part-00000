Here\u2019s How We Lost America\u2019s Trust.\n\nUri Berliner, a veteran at the public radio institution, says the network lost\nits way when it started telling listeners how to think.\n\nBy Uri Berliner\n\nApril 9, 2024\n\nYou know the stereotype of the NPR listener: an EV-driving, Wordle-playing,\ntote bag\u2013carrying coastal elite. It doesn\u2019t precisely describe me, but it\u2019s\nnot far off. I\u2019m Sarah Lawrence\u2013educated, was raised by a lesbian peace\nactivist mother, I drive a Subaru, and Spotify says my listening habits are\nmost similar to people in Berkeley.\n\nI fit the NPR mold. I\u2019ll cop to that.\n\nSo when I got a job here 25 years ago, I never looked back. As a senior editor\non the business desk where news is always breaking, we\u2019ve covered upheavals in\nthe workplace, supermarket prices, social media, and AI.\n\nIt\u2019s true NPR has always had a liberal bent, but during most of my tenure\nhere, an open-minded, curious culture prevailed. We were nerdy, but not knee-\njerk, activist, or scolding.\n\nIn recent years, however, that has changed. Today, those who listen to NPR or\nread its coverage online find something different: the distilled worldview of\na very small segment of the U.S. population.\n\nIf you are conservative, you will read this and say, duh, it\u2019s always been\nthis way.\n\nBut it hasn\u2019t.\n\nFor decades, since its founding in 1970, a wide swath of America tuned in to\nNPR for reliable journalism and gorgeous audio pieces with birds singing in\nthe Amazon. Millions came to us for conversations that exposed us to voices\naround the country and the world radically different from our own\u2014engaging\nprecisely because they were unguarded and unpredictable. No image generated\nmore pride within NPR than the farmer listening to Morning Edition from his or\nher tractor at sunrise.\n\nBack in 2011, although NPR\u2019s audience tilted a bit to the left, it still bore\na resemblance to America at large. Twenty-six percent of listeners described\nthemselves as conservative, 23 percent as middle of the road, and 37 percent\nas liberal.\n\nBy 2023, the picture was completely different: only 11 percent described\nthemselves as very or somewhat conservative, 21 percent as middle of the road,\nand 67 percent of listeners said they were very or somewhat liberal. We\nweren\u2019t just losing conservatives; we were also losing moderates and\ntraditional liberals.\n\nAn open-minded spirit no longer exists within NPR, and now, predictably, we\ndon\u2019t have an audience that reflects America.\n\nThat wouldn\u2019t be a problem for an openly polemical news outlet serving a niche\naudience. But for NPR, which purports to consider all things, it\u2019s devastating\nboth for its journalism and its business model.\n\nLike many unfortunate things, the rise of advocacy took off with Donald Trump.\nAs in many newsrooms, his election in 2016 was greeted at NPR with a mixture\nof disbelief, anger, and despair. (Just to note, I eagerly voted against Trump\ntwice but felt we were obliged to cover him fairly.) But what began as tough,\nstraightforward coverage of a belligerent, truth-impaired president veered\ntoward efforts to damage or topple Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nPersistent rumors that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia over the\nelection became the catnip that drove reporting. At NPR, we hitched our wagon\nto Trump\u2019s most visible antagonist, Representative Adam Schiff.\n\nSchiff, who was the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, became\nNPR\u2019s guiding hand, its ever-present muse. By my count, NPR hosts interviewed\nSchiff 25 times about Trump and Russia. During many of those conversations,\nSchiff alluded to purported evidence of collusion. The Schiff talking points\nbecame the drumbeat of NPR news reports.\n\nBut when the Mueller report found no credible evidence of collusion, NPR\u2019s\ncoverage was notably sparse. Russiagate quietly faded from our programming.\n\nIt is one thing to swing and miss on a major story. Unfortunately, it happens.\nYou follow the wrong leads, you get misled by sources you trusted, you\u2019re\nemotionally invested in a narrative, and bits of circumstantial evidence never\nadd up. It\u2019s bad to blow a big story.\n\nWhat\u2019s worse is to pretend it never happened, to move on with no mea culpas,\nno self-reflection. Especially when you expect high standards of transparency\nfrom public figures and institutions, but don\u2019t practice those standards\nyourself. That\u2019s what shatters trust and engenders cynicism about the media.\n\nRussiagate was not NPR\u2019s only miscue.\n\nIn October 2020, the New York Post published the explosive report about the\nlaptop Hunter Biden abandoned at a Delaware computer shop containing emails\nabout his sordid business dealings. With the election only weeks away, NPR\nturned a blind eye. Here\u2019s how NPR\u2019s managing editor for news at the time\nexplained the thinking: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to waste our time on stories that are\nnot really stories, and we don\u2019t want to waste the listeners\u2019 and readers\u2019\ntime on stories that are just pure distractions.\u201d\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t a pure distraction, or a product of Russian disinformation, as\ndozens of former and current intelligence officials suggested. The laptop did\nbelong to Hunter Biden. Its contents revealed his connection to the corrupt\nworld of multimillion-dollar influence peddling and its possible implications\nfor his father.\n\nThe laptop was newsworthy. But the timeless journalistic instinct of following\na hot story lead was being squelched. During a meeting with colleagues, I\nlistened as one of NPR\u2019s best and most fair-minded journalists said it was\ngood we weren\u2019t following the laptop story because it could help Trump.\n\nWhen the essential facts of the Post\u2019s reporting were confirmed and the emails\nverified independently about a year and a half later, we could have fessed up\nto our misjudgment. But, like Russia collusion, we didn\u2019t make the hard choice\nof transparency.\n\nPolitics also intruded into NPR\u2019s Covid coverage, most notably in reporting on\nthe origin of the pandemic. One of the most dismal aspects of Covid journalism\nis how quickly it defaulted to ideological story lines. For example, there was\nTeam Natural Origin\u2014supporting the hypothesis that the virus came from a wild\nanimal market in Wuhan, China. And on the other side, Team Lab Leak, leaning\ninto the idea that the virus escaped from a Wuhan lab.\n\nThe lab leak theory came in for rough treatment almost immediately, dismissed\nas racist or a right-wing conspiracy theory. Anthony Fauci and former NIH head\nFrancis Collins, representing the public health establishment, were its most\nnotable critics. And that was enough for NPR. We became fervent members of\nTeam Natural Origin, even declaring that the lab leak had been debunked by\nscientists.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the case.\n\nWhen word first broke of a mysterious virus in Wuhan, a number of leading\nvirologists immediately suspected it could have leaked from a lab there\nconducting experiments on bat coronaviruses. This was in January 2020, during\ncalmer moments before a global pandemic had been declared, and before fear\nspread and politics intruded.\n\nReporting on a possible lab leak soon became radioactive. Fauci and Collins\napparently encouraged the March publication of an influential scientific paper\nknown as \u201cThe Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2.\u201d Its authors wrote they didn\u2019t\nbelieve \u201cany type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible.\u201d\n\nBut the lab leak hypothesis wouldn\u2019t die. And understandably so. In private,\neven some of the scientists who penned the article dismissing it sounded a\ndifferent tune. One of the authors, Andrew Rambaut, an evolutionary biologist\nfrom Edinburgh University, wrote to his colleagues, \u201cI literally swivel day by\nday thinking it is a lab escape or natural.\u201d\n\nOver the course of the pandemic, a number of investigative journalists made\ncompelling, if not conclusive, cases for the lab leak. But at NPR, we weren\u2019t\nabout to swivel or even tiptoe away from the insistence with which we backed\nthe natural origin story. We didn\u2019t budge when the Energy Department\u2014the\nfederal agency with the most expertise about laboratories and biological\nresearch\u2014concluded, albeit with low confidence, that a lab leak was the most\nlikely explanation for the emergence of the virus.\n\nInstead, we introduced our coverage of that development on February 28, 2023,\nby asserting confidently that \u201cthe scientific evidence overwhelmingly points\nto a natural origin for the virus.\u201d\n\nWhen a colleague on our science desk was asked why they were so dismissive of\nthe lab leak theory, the response was odd. The colleague compared it to the\nBush administration\u2019s unfounded argument that Iraq possessed weapons of mass\ndestruction, apparently meaning we won\u2019t get fooled again. But these two\nevents were not even remotely related. Again, politics were blotting out the\ncuriosity and independence that ought to have been driving our work.\n\nI\u2019m offering three examples of widely followed stories where I believe we\nfaltered. Our coverage is out there in the public domain. Anyone can read or\nlisten for themselves and make their own judgment. But to truly understand how\nindependent journalism suffered at NPR, you need to step inside the\norganization.\n\nYou need to start with former CEO John Lansing. Lansing came to NPR in 2019\nfrom the federally funded agency that oversees Voice of America. Like others\nwho have served in the top job at NPR, he was hired primarily to raise money\nand to ensure good working relations with hundreds of member stations that\nacquire NPR\u2019s programming.\n\nAfter working mostly behind the scenes, Lansing became a more visible and\nforceful figure after the killing of George Floyd in May 2020. It was an\nanguished time in the newsroom, personally and professionally so for NPR\nstaffers. Floyd\u2019s murder, captured on video, changed both the conversation and\nthe daily operations at NPR.\n\nGiven the circumstances of Floyd\u2019s death, it would have been an ideal moment\nto tackle a difficult question: Is America, as progressive activists claim,\nbeset by systemic racism in the 2020s\u2014in law enforcement, education, housing,\nand elsewhere? We happen to have a very powerful tool for answering such\nquestions: journalism. Journalism that lets evidence lead the way.\n\nBut the message from the top was very different. America\u2019s infestation with\nsystemic racism was declared loud and clear: it was a given. Our mission was\nto change it.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to identifying and ending systemic racism,\u201d Lansing wrote in a\ncompanywide article, \u201cwe can be agents of change. Listening and deep\nreflection are necessary but not enough. They must be followed by constructive\nand meaningful steps forward. I will hold myself accountable for this.\u201d\n\nAnd we were told that NPR itself was part of the problem. In confessional\nlanguage he said the leaders of public media, \u201cstarting with me\u2014must be aware\nof how we ourselves have benefited from white privilege in our careers. We\nmust understand the unconscious bias we bring to our work and interactions.\nAnd we must commit ourselves\u2014body and soul\u2014to profound changes in ourselves\nand our institutions.\u201d\n\nHe declared that diversity\u2014on our staff and in our audience\u2014was the overriding\nmission, the \u201cNorth Star\u201d of the organization. Phrases like \u201cthat\u2019s part of\nthe North Star\u201d became part of meetings and more casual conversation.\n\nRace and identity became paramount in nearly every aspect of the workplace.\nJournalists were required to ask everyone we interviewed their race, gender,\nand ethnicity (among other questions), and had to enter it in a centralized\ntracking system. We were given unconscious bias training sessions. A growing\nDEI staff offered regular meetings imploring us to \u201cstart talking about race.\u201d\nMonthly dialogues were offered for \u201cwomen of color\u201d and \u201cmen of color.\u201d\nNonbinary people of color were included, too.\n\nThese initiatives, bolstered by a $1 million grant from the NPR Foundation,\ncame from management, from the top down. Crucially, they were in sync\nculturally with what was happening at the grassroots\u2014among producers,\nreporters, and other staffers. Most visible was a burgeoning number of\nemployee resource (or affinity) groups based on identity.\n\nThey included MGIPOC (Marginalized Genders and Intersex People of Color\nmentorship program); Mi Gente (Latinx employees at NPR); NPR Noir (black\nemployees at NPR); Southwest Asians and North Africans at NPR; Ummah (for\nMuslim-identifying employees); Women, Gender-Expansive, and Transgender People\nin Technology Throughout Public Media; Khevre (Jewish heritage and culture at\nNPR); and NPR Pride (LGBTQIA employees at NPR).\n\nAll this reflected a broader movement in the culture of people clustering\ntogether based on ideology or a characteristic of birth. If, as NPR\u2019s internal\nwebsite suggested, the groups were simply a \u201cgreat way to meet like-minded\ncolleagues\u201d and \u201chelp new employees feel included,\u201d it would have been one\nthing.\n\nBut the role and standing of affinity groups, including those outside NPR,\nwere more than that. They became a priority for NPR\u2019s union, SAG-AFTRA\u2014an item\nin collective bargaining. The current contract, in a section on DEI, requires\nNPR management to \u201ckeep up to date with current language and style guidance\nfrom journalism affinity groups\u201d and to inform employees if language differs\nfrom the diktats of those groups. In such a case, the dispute could go before\nthe DEI Accountability Committee.\n\nIn essence, this means the NPR union, of which I am a dues-paying member, has\nensured that advocacy groups are given a seat at the table in determining the\nterms and vocabulary of our news coverage.\n\nConflicts between workers and bosses, between labor and management, are common\nin workplaces. NPR has had its share. But what\u2019s notable is the extent to\nwhich people at every level of NPR have comfortably coalesced around the\nprogressive worldview.\n\nAnd this, I believe, is the most damaging development at NPR: the absence of\nviewpoint diversity.\n\nThere\u2019s an unspoken consensus about the stories we should pursue and how they\nshould be framed. It\u2019s frictionless\u2014one story after another about instances of\nsupposed racism, transphobia, signs of the climate apocalypse, Israel doing\nsomething bad, and the dire threat of Republican policies. It\u2019s almost like an\nassembly line.\n\nThe mindset prevails in choices about language. In a document called NPR\nTransgender Coverage Guidance\u2014disseminated by news management\u2014we\u2019re asked to\navoid the term biological sex. (The editorial guidance was prepared with the\nhelp of a former staffer of the National Center for Transgender Equality.) The\nmindset animates bizarre stories\u2014on how The Beatles and bird names are\nracially problematic, and others that are alarmingly divisive; justifying\nlooting, with claims that fears about crime are racist; and suggesting that\nAsian Americans who oppose affirmative action have been manipulated by white\nconservatives.\n\nMore recently, we have approached the Israel-Hamas war and its spillover onto\nstreets and campuses through the \u201cintersectional\u201d lens that has jumped from\nthe faculty lounge to newsrooms. Oppressor versus oppressed. That\u2019s meant\nhighlighting the suffering of Palestinians at almost every turn while\ndownplaying the atrocities of October 7, overlooking how Hamas intentionally\nputs Palestinian civilians in peril, and giving little weight to the explosion\nof antisemitic hate around the world.\n\nFor nearly all my career, working at NPR has been a source of great pride.\nIt\u2019s a privilege to work in the newsroom at a crown jewel of American\njournalism. My colleagues are congenial and hardworking.\n\nI can\u2019t count the number of times I would meet someone, describe what I do,\nand they\u2019d say, \u201cI love NPR!\u201d\n\nAnd they wouldn\u2019t stop there. They would mention their favorite host or one of\nthose \u201cdriveway moments\u201d where a story was so good you\u2019d stay in your car\nuntil it finished.\n\nIt still happens, but often now the trajectory of the conversation is\ndifferent. After the initial \u201cI love NPR,\u201d there\u2019s a pause and a person will\nacknowledge, \u201cI don\u2019t listen as much as I used to.\u201d Or, with some chagrin:\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening there? Why is NPR telling me what to think?\u201d\n\nIn recent years I\u2019ve struggled to answer that question. Concerned by the lack\nof viewpoint diversity, I looked at voter registration for our newsroom. In\nD.C., where NPR is headquartered and many of us live, I found 87 registered\nDemocrats working in editorial positions and zero Republicans. None.\n\nSo on May 3, 2021, I presented the findings at an all-hands editorial staff\nmeeting. When I suggested we had a diversity problem with a score of 87\nDemocrats and zero Republicans, the response wasn\u2019t hostile. It was worse. It\nwas met with profound indifference. I got a few messages from surprised,\ncurious colleagues. But the messages were of the \u201coh wow, that\u2019s weird\u201d\nvariety, as if the lopsided tally was a random anomaly rather than a critical\nfailure of our diversity North Star.\n\nIn a follow-up email exchange, a top NPR news executive told me that she had\nbeen \u201cskewered\u201d for bringing up diversity of thought when she arrived at NPR.\nSo, she said, \u201cI want to be careful how we discuss this publicly.\u201d\n\nFor years, I have been persistent. When I believe our coverage has gone off\nthe rails, I have written regular emails to top news leaders, sometimes even\nhaving one-on-one sessions with them. On March 10, 2022, I wrote to a top news\nexecutive about the numerous times we described the controversial education\nbill in Florida as the \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d bill when it didn\u2019t even use the word\ngay. I pushed to set the record straight, and wrote another time to ask why we\nkeep using that word that many Hispanics hate\u2014Latinx. On March 31, 2022, I was\ninvited to a managers\u2019 meeting to present my observations.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, no one has ever trashed me. That\u2019s not the NPR\nway. People are polite. But nothing changes. So I\u2019ve become a visible wrong-\nthinker at a place I love. It\u2019s uncomfortable, sometimes heartbreaking.\n\nEven so, out of frustration, on November 6, 2022, I wrote to the captain of\nship North Star\u2014CEO John Lansing\u2014about the lack of viewpoint diversity and\nasked if we could have a conversation about it. I got no response, so I\nfollowed up four days later. He said he would appreciate hearing my\nperspective and copied his assistant to set up a meeting. On December 15, the\nmorning of the meeting, Lansing\u2019s assistant wrote back to cancel our\nconversation because he was under the weather. She said he was looking forward\nto chatting and a new meeting invitation would be sent. But it never came.\n\nI won\u2019t speculate about why our meeting never happened. Being CEO of NPR is a\ndemanding job with lots of constituents and headaches to deal with. But what\u2019s\nindisputable is that no one in a C-suite or upper management position has\nchosen to deal with the lack of viewpoint diversity at NPR and how that\naffects our journalism.\n\nWhich is a shame. Because for all the emphasis on our North Star, NPR\u2019s news\naudience in recent years has become less diverse, not more so. Back in 2011,\nour audience leaned a bit to the left but roughly reflected America\npolitically; now, the audience is cramped into a smaller, progressive silo.\n\nDespite all the resources we\u2019d devoted to building up our news audience among\nblacks and Hispanics, the numbers have barely budged. In 2023, according to\nour demographic research, 6 percent of our news audience was black, far short\nof the overall U.S. adult population, which is 14.4 percent black. And\nHispanics were only 7 percent, compared to the overall Hispanic adult\npopulation, around 19 percent. Our news audience doesn\u2019t come close to\nreflecting America. It\u2019s overwhelmingly white and progressive, and clustered\naround coastal cities and college towns.\n\nThese are perilous times for news organizations. Last year, NPR laid off or\nbought out 10 percent of its staff and canceled four podcasts following a\nslump in advertising revenue. Our radio audience is dwindling and our podcast\ndownloads are down from 2020. The digital stories on our website rarely have\nnational impact. They aren\u2019t conversation starters. Our competitive advantage\nin audio\u2014where for years NPR had no peer\u2014is vanishing. There are plenty of\ninformative and entertaining podcasts to choose from.\n\nEven within our diminished audience, there\u2019s evidence of trouble at the most\nbasic level: trust.\n\nIn February, our audience insights team sent an email proudly announcing that\nwe had a higher trustworthy score than CNN or The New York Times. But the\nresearch from Harris Poll is hardly reassuring. It found that \u201c3-in-10\naudience members familiar with NPR said they associate NPR with the\ncharacteristic \u2018trustworthy.\u2019 \u201d Only in a world where media credibility has\ncompletely imploded would a 3-in-10 trustworthy score be something to boast\nabout.\n\nWith declining ratings, sorry levels of trust, and an audience that has become\nless diverse over time, the trajectory for NPR is not promising. Two paths\nseem clear. We can keep doing what we\u2019re doing, hoping it will all work out.\nOr we could start over, with the basic building blocks of journalism. We could\nface up to where we\u2019ve gone wrong. News organizations don\u2019t go in for that\nkind of reckoning. But there\u2019s a good reason for NPR to be the first: we\u2019re\nthe ones with the word public in our name.\n\nDespite our missteps at NPR, defunding isn\u2019t the answer. As the country\nbecomes more fractured, there\u2019s still a need for a public institution where\nstories are told and viewpoints exchanged in good faith. Defunding, as a\nrebuke from Congress, wouldn\u2019t change the journalism at NPR. That needs to\ncome from within.\n\nA few weeks ago, NPR welcomed a new CEO, Katherine Maher, who\u2019s been a leader\nin tech. She doesn\u2019t have a news background, which could be an asset given\nwhere things stand. I\u2019ll be rooting for her. It\u2019s a tough job. Her first rule\ncould be simple enough: don\u2019t tell people how to think. It could even be the\nnew North Star.\n\nUri Berliner is a senior business editor and reporter at NPR.
