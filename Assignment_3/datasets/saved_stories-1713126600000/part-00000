This species of algae is the \u201cfirst nitrogen-\nfixing eukaryote\u201d, he adds, referring to the group of organisms that includes\nplants and animals.\n\nIn 2012, Zehr and his colleagues reported that the marine algae\nBraarudosphaera bigelowii interacted closely with a bacterium called UCYN-A\nthat seemed to live in, or on, the algal cells^2. The researchers hypothesised\nthat UCYN-A converts nitrogen gas into compounds that the algae use to grow,\nsuch as ammonia. In return, the bacteria were thought to gain a carbon-based\nenergy source from the algae.\n\nBut in the latest study, Zehr and his colleagues conclude that UCYN-A should\nbe classed as organelles inside the algae, rather than as a separate organism.\nAccording to genetic analysis from a previous study, ancestors of the algae\nand bacteria entered a symbiotic relationship around 100 million years ago,\nsays Zehr. Eventually, this gave rise to the nitroplast organelle, now seen in\nB. bigelowii.\n\n## Defining organelles\n\nResearchers use two key criteria to decide whether a bacterial cell has become\nan organelle in a host cell. First, the cell structure in question must be\npassed down through generations of the host cell. Second, the structure must\nbe reliant on proteins provided by the host cell.\n\nBy imaging dozens of algae cells at various stages of cell division, the team\nfound that the nitroplast splits in two just before the whole algae cell\ndivides. In this way, one nitroplast is passed down from the parent cell to\nits offspring, as happens with other cell structures.\n\nA seagrass harbours a nitrogen-fixing bacterial partner\n\nNext, the researchers found that the nitroplast gets the proteins it needs to\ngrow from the wider algae cell. The nitroplast itself \u2014 which makes up more\nthan 8% of the volume of each host cell \u2014 lacks key proteins required for\nphotosynthesis and making genetic material, says Zehr. \u201cA lot of these\nproteins [from the algae] are just filling those gaps in metabolism,\u201d he says.\n\nThe discovery was made possible thanks to work by study author Kyoko Hagino at\nKochi University in Japan, who spent around a decade fine-tuning a way to grow\nthe algae in the lab \u2014 which allowed it to be studied in more detail, says\nZehr.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite remarkable,\u201d says Siv Andersson, who studies how organelles evolve\nat Uppsala University in Sweden. \u201cThey really see all these hallmarks that we\nthink are characteristic of organelles.\u201d\n\n## Upgraded plants\n\nUnderstanding how the nitroplast interacts with its host cell could support\nefforts to engineer crops that can fix their own nitrogen, says Zehr. This\nwould reduce the need for nitrogen-based fertilizers and avoid some of the\nenvironmental damage they cause. \u201cThe tricks that are involved in making this\nsystem work could be used in engineering land plants,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cCrop yields are majorly limited by availability of nitrogen,\u201d says Eva\nNowack, who studies symbiotic bacteria at the Heinrich Heine University\nD\u00fcsseldorf in Germany. \u201cHaving a nitrogen-fixing organelle in a crop plant\nwould be, of course, fantastic.\u201d But introducing this ability into plants will\nbe no easy feat, she warns. Plant cells containing the genetic code for the\nnitroplast would need to be engineered in such a way that the genes were\ntransferred stably from generation to generation, for example. \u201cThat would be\nthe most difficult thing to do,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s both a pleasure and very impressive to see this work build up to what is\ncertainly a major stepping stone in understanding,\u201d says Jeffrey Elhai, a cell\nbiologist at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, Vriginia.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01046-z\n\n## References\n\n  1.
