This study establishes the Periodic Table of Primes (PTP)\nusing four prime numbers of 2, 3, 5, and 7. We identify 48 integers out of a\nperiod of 2x3x5x7=210 to be the roots of all primes as well as composites\nwithout factors of 2, 3, 5, and 7. Each prime, twin primes, or composite\nwithout factors of 2, 3, 5 and 7 is an offspring of the 48 integers uniquely\nallocated on the PTP. Three major establishments made in the article are the\nFormula of Primes, the Periodic Table of Primes, and the Counting Functions of\nPrimes and Twin Primes.\n\nKeywords: Primes, composites, the Periodic Table of Primes\n\nSuggested Citation: Suggested Citation\n\nLi, Han-Lin and Fang, Shu-Cherng and Kuo, Way, The Periodic Table of Primes\n(January 25, 2024).
