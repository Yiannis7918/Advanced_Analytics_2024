This is equivalent to 4.55 Tbps per millimeter of bandwidth at less\nthan half a picojoule per bit. Die-to-die performance like this is usually\nseen only in advanced packaging designs using costly and complicated silicon\ninterposers, he said, whereas Eliyan\u2019s PHY technology enables multi-chiplet\ndesigns with advanced-packaging\u2013like performance on standard organic\nsubstrates.\n\nAchieving HBM3-like memory bandwidth on standard packaging could have\nimplications for future chiplet-based AI accelerators, particularly those\ndesigned for generative AI inference, in which memory capacity and bandwidth\nare critical. Eliyan\u2019s technology also allows more HBM stacks to surround each\ncompute chiplet via extended reach and daisy-chaining.\n\nEliyan\u2019s overall goal is to accelerate the adoption of chiplets, Farjadrad\nsaid.\n\n\u201cThe key to effectively democratizing chiplet technology is to be able to\nconnect them at a very high speed, with low power and low latency, similar to\nwhat people can do by connecting them using advanced packaging,\u201d he said. \u201cBut\nnot everybody can get access to TSMC or wants to add four to six months\u2019 lead\ntime just to get the packaging.\u201d\n\nPartner Content\n\nView All\n\nNuvoton drives the EV market with its cutting-edge battery monitoring chipset\nsolution\n\nBy Nuvoton Technology Corporation Japan 04.03.2024\n\nImproved Power Efficiency and AI Inference in Autonomous Systems\n\nBy Shingo Kojima, Sr Principal Engineer of Embedded Processing, Renesas\nElectronics 03.26.2024\n\nLeveraging Advanced Microcontroller Features to Improve Industrial Fan\nPerformance\n\nBy Dylan Liu, Geehy Semiconductor 03.21.2024\n\nAdvanced packaging requires either active or passive silicon interposers,\nwhich add cost and lead time. Advanced packaging technologies like TSMC\u2019s\nCoWoS (chip on wafer on substrate) is proprietary and much of the fab capacity\nis taken up by companies like Nvidia and AMD today. Standard packaging on\norganic substrates, by comparison, is cheaper and widely available.\n\n(From left to right) Eliyan founders Syrus Ziai, Ramin Farjadrad and Patrick\nSoheili (Source: Eliyan)\n\nIndustry trends are toward bigger and bigger systems-in-package (SiPs), with\nmore compute chiplets and more memory, Farjadrad said. Doing away with the\nsilicon interposer means not being limited by its size, which means more\nchiplets can be used. Eliyan\u2019s PHY also allows a greater range (20 or 30 mm),\nso chiplets can be placed further apart to help ease thermal restrictions.\n\n\u201cEven today\u2019s three-and-a-half-reticle\u2013sized interposers, going to four, does\nnot seem to be enough,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople want five, six reticles or more. But\nonce you eliminate the need for the interposer, then a lot of these\nlimitations go away. If we can provide something that is close to advanced\npackaging performance [with standard packaging], it opens up the door for a\nlot of innovation.\u201d\n\nAMD has one of the biggest interposers today that can fit eight HBM stacks on\nit, but by sticking with organic substrates, a SiP can be much bigger.\n\n\u201cWith organic substrates, we can go to 10\u00d7 the reticle size\u2014maybe put two\nASICs on it, and 12 or 16 or 24 HBMs using our daisy-chaining technique,\u201d\nFarjadrad said.\n\nWhile chiplets have been proposed as a solution to the memory wall, today,\nthey are still limited by their beachfront. Eliyan can daisy-chain HBMs to\nprovide the bandwidth of two HBMs across one beachfront, doubling the\nbandwidth per millimeter of beachfront. Eliyan PHYs also enable bidirectional\ncommunication on each wire, doubling bandwidth again.\n\nAll this requires stellar PHY performance, of course. Eliyan\u2019s PHY is bump-\nlimited, fitting an under-100-\u03bcm bump pitch in standard packaging or 55 \u03bcm in\nadvanced packaging.\n\n\u201cWe use a lot of techniques and trade secrets we\u2019ve learned over the years to\nbuild these PHYs super-small so they can fit into a small block,\u201d Farjadrad\nsaid. \u201cIt\u2019s all about how many PHYs you can fit into the beachfront. One of\nthe big challenges to do this in standard packaging is crosstalk between the\nlanes, which run at really high speed and you pack them really close together.\nKnowing how to cancel this crosstalk at very low power [is one of our trade\nsecrets].\u201d\n\nHBM manufacturers\u2019 willingness to offer custom HBM, in which the bottom die in\nan HBM stack can have custom circuitry, has provided an easy route for\nadoption. Eliyan\u2019s PHY can sit on this die.\n\n\u201cIn the past, you had to convince the whole industry to adopt this standard\nfirst,\u201d Farjadrad said. \u201c[The availability of custom HBM] says a lot because\nit shows how much the market is thirsty for higher performance.\u201d\n\nThe technology is not just for memory, he points out\u2014it applies equally to\njoining heterogeneous compute chiplets at high bandwidth and low power,\nwithout advanced packaging.\n\nEliyan\u2019s PHY is compatible with both Bunch of Wires (BoW) and Universal\nChiplet Interconnect Express (UCIe) (the standards have very similar\nsignaling, Farjadrad said), and it can support simultaneous bidirectional\ncommunication using BoW or UCIe, provided the Eliyan PHY is used at both ends\nof the link. Eliyan is also contributing to the Universal Memory Interface\n(UMI) and Standard Packaging High Bandwidth Memory (SPHBM) standards for\nmemory interfaces.\n\nFarjadrad pointed out that sticking to standard packaging can also enable\nchiplet designs in applications like industrial and automotive, which prohibit\nmicrobumps due to their shock and vibration susceptibility.\n\n### \u2018Magical\u2019 numbers\n\nMihira AI CEO, GPU guru Raja Koduri, and his team have been evaluating\nEliyan\u2019s technology from the perspectives of both a potential customer and as\na potential partner driving collaboration between compute chiplet and memory\nchiplet makers.\n\n\u201cI have several scars on my back from advanced packaging,\u201d Koduri said (Koduri\npreviously drove the first implementation of HBM at AMD and later led several\nEMIB-based products at Intel, including Kaby Lake G and the famous 47-chiplet\nPonte Vecchio design). \u201cWhen I first heard from Ramin and team what they\u2019re\nworking on ... achieving those numbers is magical.\u201d\n\nRaja Koduri (Source: Kisaco Research & Jeffrey Hosier Photography)\n\nKoduri said Eliyan\u2019s 4.55-Tbps/mm performance means that with a realistic 8-10\nmm of die edge, designs can achieve HBM4 Gen2-like bandwidths, or higher, on\nan organic substrate without an interposer. Given his experiences, he\nimmediately saw the benefits of using standard packaging: increasing the\nnumber of chiplets while avoiding advanced packaging\u2019s cost, yield issues and\nassembly time.\n\nMihira, an AI cloud startup, has a small silicon architecture team working on\npotential silicon IP ideas.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait for [Eliyan IP] to be put into some interesting projects my team\nis involved in,\u201d Koduri said, declining to give further details on what kinds\nof projects the team may be working on, saying only that his architecture team\nhad been sketching \u201cvarious interesting things.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeing able to provide uniform high bandwidth across four die edges opens up\nso many interesting architectures,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can essentially put a whole\nrack of compute on an organic substrate\u2014your problem fundamentally is back to\nthermals and power, which is what it should be.\u201d\n\nKoduri\u2019s point is that today\u2019s multi-chiplet assemblies are limited by the\ndesign constraints of complicated packaging technologies, which designers\ndon\u2019t have much control over. With standard packaging, those constraints are\nremoved, and the limitations revert to the physics of powering and cooling the\nassembly.\n\nHe is also excited about the design possibilities that extending the reach of\ndie-to-die links will bring, as it means fewer constraints on where chiplets\ncan be placed, opening up another degree of freedom.\n\nKoduri also sees the cost of advanced packaging as a critical factor where\nEliyan\u2019s technology is potentially disruptive.\n\n\u201cFrom the packaging and solution perspective, with everything we looked at,\nthere was no [other] way to bring the advanced packaging plus HBM cost down\nsignificantly,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone competing with Nvidia right now is\ncompeting on price, frankly ... If we want lower-cost solutions, we need\ntechnologies like what Eliyan has been working on.\u201d\n\nThe first silicon for Eliyan\u2019s NuLink PHY in 3 nm is expected in Q3 2024.\n\nRELATED TOPICS: 3D PACKAGING, ADVANCED PACKAGING, AI, AI AND BIG DATA, AI AND\nMACHINE LEARNING, AI AND ML, AI CHIP, AI CHIPS, CHIP PACKAGING, CHIPLET,\nCHIPLET DESIGN, CHIPLETS, DRAM, HIGH BANDWIDTH MEMORY, MEMORY, PACKAGING\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * LinkedIn\n\nSally Ward-Foxton\n\nSally Ward-Foxton covers AI for EETimes.com and EETimes Europe magazine.

Of course, given\nthe very sensitive nature of BER, it's difficult to provide more accurate\ninformation on that till we have the silicon (and we hope to get better\nperformance)\n\nLog in to Reply\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nYou must Register or Login to post a comment.\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
