The idea is to\nmake ISPs \u2014 which routinely mislead consumers about pricing, speeds,\nrestrictions, usage caps, and everything else \u2014 be more transparent with the\nend user at the point of sale.\n\nAfter a lot of whining by telecom giants, the FCC finally announced this week\nthat starting today, ISPs must include such a label in marketing materials and\ntheir websites clearly disclosing the type of connection consumers are buying.\nThe FCC\u2019s demo label looks like this:\n\nSmaller ISPs, which may find the costs of compliance more annoying than bigger\nISPs, have until October to implement them. According to the FCC, these new\nlabels will mandate transparency, something FCC boss Jessica Rosenworcel seems\nto think will aid competition:\n\n> \u201cThese \u2018nutrition label\u2019 disclosures are designed to make it simpler for\n> consumers to know what they are getting, hold providers to their promises,\n> and benefit from greater competition\u2014which means better service and prices\n> for everyone.\u201d\n\nThis is certainly an improvement, and transparency is good.\n\nThe problem: most U.S. consumers don\u2019t have a choice of broadband providers\nbecause giant telecom monopolies have spent the last forty-five years lobbying\ngovernment into a state of abject fecklessness and crushing competitors\nunderfoot. The result: limited competition, high prices, spotty access\n(despite billions in subsidies), slow speeds, and comically terrible customer\nservice.\n\nSo the nutrition label can make it clearer to these users that they\u2019re being\nabused and ripped off, but it doesn\u2019t come anywhere close to stopping them\nfrom being abused and ripped off. Especially if the FCC enforcement is\ninconsistent and its fines are pathetic (which has been a multi-decade problem\nfor this agency).\n\nThe Trump FCC was a direct proxy for the interests of telecom giants like\nComcast and AT&T. The Biden FCC is notably better, but it\u2019s still relatively\nfeckless when it comes to directly challenging big monopolies directly\ntethered to our domestic surveillance systems. You\u2019d be hard pressed to find a\npublic statement by the Rosenworcel FCC even acknowledging monopoly and\nconsolidation is a problem.\n\nSo what you get is these sort of long overdue half measures and a sort of\nregulatory theater by political careerists waiting for their next political\nopportunity or industry think tank gig. A performance that\u2019s sometimes well\nintentioned, but generally nibbles around the symptoms and the edges, never\ntackling the real problem.\n\nISPs wouldn\u2019t be implementing bullshit usage caps, or violating net\nneutrality, or implementing misleading fees, or consistently abusing consumer\nprivacy, or over-charging for service if we had both competent regulatory\noversight and meaningful market competition. In most U.S. markets, we have\nneither. Very few have both. And I would think, after decades of this, the end\nresult is fairly obvious.\n\nThere are numerous things the FCC could do to actually tackle the problem.\nChief among them being to admit that concentrated monopoly power is a problem.\nAnd to loudly support the massive, bipartisan grass roots movement comprised\nof city-owned utilities, cooperatives, and municipalities \u2014 so pissed by\ndecades of obvious and abject market failure \u2014 they\u2019re building their own\nnetworks in record numbers.\n\nSo yes a transparency label is good in that it requires unchecked telecom\nmonopolies to be clearer about how they\u2019re ripping you off, but it shouldn\u2019t\nbe mistaken for any sort of fix for the actual problem. An actual fix would\nrequire political courage, and that\u2019s simply not something this agency is\nknown for.\n\nFiled Under: broadband, broadband nutrition label, caps, fcc, high speed\ninternet, jessica rosenworcel, nutrition labels, telecom\n\n1 CommentLeave a Comment\n\nIf you liked this post, you may also be interested in...\n\n  * New Net Neutrality Rules Won't Harm Telecom Giants In The Slightest\n  * AT&T Stops Pretending It Had Nothing To Do With A Massive Data Breach Impacting 73 Million Customers.

Skies were clear and the crowd was shouting in northern Vermont, though I could have done without the 11 hour car ride home.\n  * Mike Masnick: Yup! We're in Texas and ended up driving pretty far out to where it was predicted to be clearer and we had a great view.\n  * John Roddy: It's funny. I've actually been going around telling people that Sun is currently nearing the peak of its 11-year cycle and has been unusually active recently.\n  * Didn't even occur to me that you'd be able to *see* that during the eclipse.\n  * Because the corona is where all of that really shows.\n  * Also spaceweather.gov\n  * Not enough government websites have a chart on their homepage that shows real-time updates on the current measured proton flux.\n  * mildconcern: fantastic, I'm glad you got to see it too.\n  * And yes they were three solar flares going, one of which was big enough to be seen by the naked eye\n  * only two small sun spots though\n  * John Roddy: No, that's one *gigantic* sun spot.\n  * Mike Masnick: the weirdest thing, though, was we had no traffic at all. we found a small town in texas that was a bit off the beaten path, but looked like the weather would cooperate, and we drove 75 miles from our hotel to it, saw no traffic. was able to park easily, even grabbed a nice picnic table in a gazebo. soon after we got there, the park started to fill up, but it never got *crowded*. and then afterwards, we drove back and hit no traffic on the way back either. the only \"line\" we ran into was when stopped at a pie shop on our way back to get some pie to celebrate\n  * mildconcern: I think a lot of the real fanatics ditched going to Texas all together\n  * a fair few folks in the park I was at had plans to be there and then switched up at the last minute with the forecasts to come to New England instead\n  * The town I was in moved their location from the smaller park downtown to this bigger one just two days before the event because of the same factors\n  * Mike Masnick: like absolutely nothing has been crowded (other than the pie stand). pickup line for rental car was non existent. no traffic to the hotel. hotel did not seem crowded at all. everything has been smooth sailing.\n  * mildconcern: The second biggest cheer of the day (after totality) happened when a truck arrived with six more porta potties to help alleviate the hour long line\n  * But it was fun having a crowd. I brought my telescope which made me popular, and it was great letting other people look through it\n  * John Roddy: It was so overcast for me that I legit couldn't even see clouds.\n  * mildconcern: I wasn't really aiming to take pictures primarily but I did get a few\n  * John Roddy: Just a perfectly homogenous gray.\n  * mildconcern: https://www.instagram.com/p/C5jo...\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/C5jo_1bvI0S/?igsh=cW85dnc5czF4Zzg4\n\n  * Mike Masnick: Heh. Yeah, the park we were in had fixed bathrooms (and even cleaned them right after the eclipse so we had clean bathrooms to use before heading out) and a big row of porta potties, but neither ever got crowded. there was a *good* sized crowd but never got crowded\n  * The one thing we didn't really have where we were was a good view of the 360 degree sunset. I remember that from the last one we saw. but didn't really see it this time due to trees around the park.\n  * You should have driven over to where we were! No traffic, very few clouds.\n  * mildconcern: yeah I did not have as good a view of the 360 as I did in Casper Wyoming. It was pretty good and you got a sense of it because we were on a lakeshore but the other angles were mountains\n  * John Roddy: Unfortunately, I had a dentist appointment at just barely after the right time. :/\n  * Which is the only reason I'm able to eat anything again.\n  * Mike Masnick: we really lucked out in 2017, because we found this random hill in the middle of absolute nowhere, eastern oregon, that gave us a 360 degrees view of NOTHING but fields from the top. It was a perfect spot to watch\n  * John Roddy: They had to try like 20 different times to get the right set of x-rays.\n  * Mike Masnick: Yikes.\n  * John Roddy: So I'm expecting to grow a second tongue within the next few days or something.\n  * Interestingly, x-ray tech has finally been miniaturized enough that the camera is entirely handheld now.\n  * The tube just has a really thick glass shield lining the end of it, presumably lined with lead.\n  * deadspatula: Fascinatingly, the big advancement has been in better dosing, not simply the size of components. The big machines needed a big burst and leaked a lot of x-rays. That's why the dentist had to hide behind the lead wall and we covered the reproductive organs - the dose wasn't bad once every six months, but multiple times a day would be serious. And the units therefore needed to be mounted. The handheld units better direct a much lower dose, and manufacturers claim technicians do not get dangerous doses of stray x-rays. That said, the notable property of x-rays is penetration. Many of the units I've seen have a guard as you describe, but nothing opaque, and if its not opaque its not lined with enough lead to matter.\n  * John Roddy: Lead lined glass is almost certainly more than enough to at least scatter any stray x-rays that find their way back.\n  * But yeah, x-ray tech in general got a pretty significant overhaul in the past decade or so.\n  * When Chandra launched in '99, it was the heaviest payload the shuttle ever carried.\n  * Fast forward to '21, and we've got IXPE.\n  * Chandra is close to 6,000kg.\n  * IXPE is just over 300.\n  * mildconcern: I wonder how much the general advancement of detectors driven by the cell phone camera revolution has spilled over. That certainly has helped the field of astronomical detection quite a bit.\n  * Digital sensors that had laughable resolution used to cost a fortune in the 1990s when they started to come out. And now you can get miracle devices for far less.\n  * John Roddy: Cell phone stuff is all in the microwave range.\n  * That's most useful for detecting the cosmic microwave background, which is probably the closest thing to a natural encyclopedia we're ever going to get.\n  * mildconcern: phone cameras also do sense visual light\n  * John Roddy: I feel like everyone I tell this to is hearing it for the first time, but...\n  * I *thought* it was common knowledge that your phone camera is pretty good at seeing infrared too.\n  * It's a really quick and easy way to check if a remote control is working.\n  * Infrared LEDs *will* be visible through the sensor.\n  * mildconcern: Oh yeah I knew that, I was just being a wiseass\n  * it's not hugely far in the infrared spectrum\n  * can't use it as a heat detector or something. Just a smidge.\n  * but I'm mostly saying in terms of astronomy applications. The overall success in designing sensors and detectors in smaller scales has hugely helped anyway\n  * no matter the wavelengths\n  * John Roddy: Yeah, the interesting stuff requires some pretty intense tech.\n  * Almost everything glows in the infrared spectrum, after all.\n  * mildconcern: It's a big part of why they stuck the JWT in space\n  * since it's mostly working in that range\n  * John Roddy: That's only half the story\n  * Spritzer needed some pretty extreme shielding too.\n  * Except the tech wasn't *quite* ready to make the active cooling reliable enough.\n  * A lot of people think of \"cold\" in terms of what chilly weather feels like on earth.\n  * The cold air sucks the heat right out of you.\n  * But space doesn't have that air.\n  * So despite space being extremely cold, it's actually really hard to cool things down out there.\n  * The reason the space shuttle always had the bay doors open in orbit is because that's where the radiators were.\n  * mildconcern: yeah. but the IR wavelengfths that JWT are detecting can't even get through at all even in Earth orbit\n  * so that's why it's out at the Lagrange Point\n  * Despite the \"can't fuck this one up and fix it later\" nature of that as opposed to Hubble\n  * John Roddy: It's not even *at* the Lagrange point\n  * It's in an orbit around it\n\nBecome an Insider!\n\nRecent Stories\n\n## Friday  \n  \n---  \n05:22| The FCC's New 'Broadband Nutrition Label' Doesn't Solve The Actual\nProblem: Unchecked Telecom Monopoly Power (1)  \n  \n## Thursday  \n  \n20:13| No, The Internet Hasn\u2019t Gotten Worse: Just Your Outlook (42)  \n15:16| Apple App Store Update Says Emulation Is Coming Back.
