C. R. Licklider and others from MIT's Project MAC\nwho had connected a computer to ARPANET the year before.^[1] According to a\nhistory of computing equipment by Columbia University it \"begins with a\nmontage of equipment ... and then has interviews with ARPANET creators.\"^[2]\nThe film discusses \"the potential that this network has for revolutionizing so\nmany industries and institutions\".^[3]\n\n### Participants[edit]\n\nSpeaking parts:\n\n  * Fernando J. Corbato (Corby):^[1] (voice 0:45-1:15, face 1:00-1:15, 15:10-15:40)\n\n    Turing Award winner, implementer of multitasking operating systems.\n\n  * J. C. R. Licklider (Lick):^[1] (1:00-1:40), and many times throughout the film. Licklider discusses how, despite the invention of the printing press being a revolution, the transmission of information on paper was slow.^[4] He also discusses collaboration, access to digital libraries, the transition to electronic information and the social processes involved in this.^[5]\n  * Lawrence G. Roberts: (voice 1:40-2:25) SIGCOMM Award winner.\n  * Robert Kahn: (2:25-2:35, 3:15-6:25, 6:55-) Turing Award winner.\n  * Frank Heart: (2:35-3:15, 6:25-6:55)\n  * William R. Sutherland (Bert): (13:50-15:10)\n  * Richard W. Watson: (17:34-18:30, 25:05-25:15) mass storage researcher\n  * John R. Pasta: (18:30-19:25)\n  * Donald W. Davies: (19:25-21:55)\n  * George W. Mitchell: (21:55-24:05, voice only)\n\nNon-speaking:\n\n  * Daniel L. Murphy: (Behind the titles, several other times including about 15:44)\n\nUnidentified:\n\n  * (8:27-8:32, with beard and glasses): previously misidentified as Jon Postel\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\nCory Doctorow called the documentary a \"fantastic 30 minutes of paleo-nerd\nmemorabilia\".^[6] Matt Novak of Gizmodo said \"When you hear a man like J.C.R.\nLicklider describe the information age before it had even begun to trickle\ninto the public consciousness, we understand how forward-thinking these people\ndeveloping the ARPANET in the late 1960s and early 1970s truly were.\"^[3] Mark\nLiberman described it as \"amazing\".^[5]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Internet portal\n\n  * History of the Internet\n  * List of Internet pioneers\n  * Nerds 2.0.1 \u2013 1998 documentary about the development of the ARPANET, the Internet, and the World Wide Web\n  * Protocol Wars\n  * Resource sharing\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c \"Multics History\". multicians.org.
