The launch began an innovative\nand tumultuous period in AI history, marked by a sense of wonder and a\npolarizing ethical debate that reverberates in the AI space to this day.\n\n### Further Reading\n\nFrom toy to tool: DALL-E 3 is a wake-up call for visual artists\u2014and the rest\nof us\n\nLast week, OpenAI turned off the ability for new customers to purchase\ngeneration credits for the web version of DALL-E 2, effectively killing it.\nFrom a technological point of view, it's not too surprising that OpenAI\nrecently began winding down support for the service. The 2-year-old image\ngeneration model was groundbreaking for its time, but it has since been\nsurpassed by DALL-E 3's higher level of detail, and OpenAI has recently begun\nrolling out DALL-E 3 editing capabilities.\n\nBut for a tight-knit group of artists and tech enthusiasts who were there at\nthe start of DALL-E 2, the service's sunset marks the bittersweet end of a\nperiod where AI technology briefly felt like a magical portal to boundless\ncreativity. \"The arrival of DALL-E 2 was truly mind-blowing,\" illustrator\nDouglas Bonneville told Ars in an interview. \"There was an exhilarating sense\nof unlimited freedom in those first days that we all suspected AI was going to\nunleash. It felt like a liberation from something into something else, but it\nwas never clear exactly what.\"\n\n## Rise of the latent space astronauts\n\nBefore DALL-E 2, AI image generation tech had been building in the background\nfor some time. Since the dawn of computers with graphical displays in the\n1950s, people have been creating images with them. As early as the 1960s,\nartists like Vera Molnar, Georg Nees, and Manfred Mohr let computers do the\ndrawing, generatively creating artwork using algorithms. Experiments from\nartists like Karl Sims in the 1990s led to one of the earliest introductions\nof neural networks into the process.\n\n### Further Reading\n\nDALL-E image generator is now open to everyone\n\nUse of AI in computer art picked up again in 2015 when Google's DeepDream used\na convolutional neural network to bring psychedelic details to existing\nimages. Then came generators based on Transformer models, an architecture\ndiscovered in 2017 by a group of Google researchers. OpenAI's DALL-E 1 debuted\nas a tech demo in early 2021, and Disco Diffusion launched later that year.\nDespite these precursors, DALL-E 2 arguably marked the mainstream breakout\npoint for text-to-image generation, allowing each user to type a description\nof what they wanted to see and have a matching image appear before their eyes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen OpenAI first announced DALL-E 2 in April 2022, certain corners of Twitter\nquickly filled with examples of surrealistic artworks it generated, such as\nteddy bears as mad scientists and astronauts on horseback. Many people were\ngenuinely shocked. \"Ok it's fake ?? tell me it's fake. April fool joke a bit\nlate,\" read one early reaction on Twitter. \"My mind can only be blown so many\ntimes. I can't take much more of this,\" wrote another Twitter user in May.\n\nOther examples of DALL-E 2 artwork collected in threads soon followed, all of\nwhich were flowing from OpenAI and a group of 200 handpicked beta testers.\n\n  * An AI-generated image of \"Teddy bears mixing sparkling chemicals as mad scientists\u201d in the style of steampunk, a 1990s Saturday morning cartoon, and digital art\" created by OpenAI and released on April 6, 2022.\n\nOpenAI\n\n  * An AI-generated image of \"a photo of an astronaut riding a horse\" created by OpenAI and released on April 6, 2022.\n\nOpenAI\n\n  * An AI-generated image of \"a Shiba Inu dog wearing a beret and black turtleneck\" created by OpenAI and released on April 6, 2022.\n\nOpenAI\n\n  * An AI-generated image of \"a bowl of soup that looks like a monster\u201d knitted out of wool, made of plasticine and spray painted on a wall\" created by OpenAI and released on April 6, 2022.\n\nOpenAI\n\n  * An AI-generated image of \"a sea otter in the style of \u2018Girl with a Pearl Earring\u2019 by Johannes Vermeer\" created by OpenAI and released on April 6, 2022.\n\nOpenAI\n\nPrevious SlideNext Slide\n\nWhen OpenAI began handing out those beta testing invitations, a common bond\nquickly spawned a small community of artists who felt like pioneers exploring\nthe new technology together. \"There was a wild time where there were a few\nartists playing around with it. We all became friends,\" said conceptual artist\nDanielle Baskin, who first received an invitation to use DALL-E 2 on March 30,\n2022, and began testing in mid-April. \"When I first got access, I felt like I\nhad a portal into infinite alternate worlds. I didn't think of it as 'art\nmaking'\u2014it felt like playing. I'd stay awake for hours just exploring.\"\n\nBecause each DALL-E image sprung forth from a written prompt like \"a photo of\na statue slipping on ice\" (drawing from associations gained in training\nbetween captions and images), the beta testers found themselves merging\nlanguage and their visual imaginations in novel ways. \"It was like being set\nloose in a lab,\" said an artist named Lapine in an interview with Ars. Lapine\nreceived early access to DALL-E 2 on April 6 and began sharing her generations\non Twitter. \"I was using descriptive language in a way I had not previously.\"\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How Scientists Respond to Science Deniers\n\n#### reader comments\n\n46\n\nBenj Edwards Benj Edwards is an AI and Machine Learning Reporter for Ars\nTechnica.
