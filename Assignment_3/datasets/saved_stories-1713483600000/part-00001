Build 19045.4353 does not contain\nanything all too exciting, but there is one change that might raise a few\neyebrows. Microsoft is now testing new banners in the Settings app to make\nusers with local accounts switch to Microsoft Accounts. The tech giant writes:\n\n> New! This update starts the rolls out of account-related notifications for\n> Microsoft accounts in Settings > Home. A Microsoft account connects Windows\n> to your Microsoft apps. The account also backs up all your data and helps\n> you to manage your subscriptions. You can also add extra security steps to\n> keep you from being locked out of your account. This feature displays\n> notifications across the Start menu and Settings.\n\nThe change seems to be rolling out gradually, which means not everyone on\nbuild 19045.4353 has it yet. However, you can force-enable it using a command\nfor the ViVeTool app. Here is what the new banner looks like:\n\nIf you do not want the Settings app to nag you with Microsoft Account prompts,\ngo to Privacy > General and toggle off the \"Show me suggested content in the\nSettings app\" option. Also, you can also simply click the close button next to\nthe \"Sign in now\" button to get rid of the banner.\n\nHere is how to turn the new banner on in case you want to witness it yourself\non build 19045.4353:\n\n  1. Download ViveTool from GitHub and unpack the files in a convenient and easy-to-find folder.\n  2. Press Win + R, type cmd, and press Ctrl + Shift + Enter to open Command Prompt as Administrator.\n  3. Navigate to the folder containing the ViveTool files with the CD command. For example, if you have placed ViveTool in C:\\Vive, type CD C:\\Vive.\n  4. Type vivetool /enable /id:42563876 and press Enter. In order to turn off the new banners in the Settings app, use vivetool /disable /id:42563876. Credit for the ID goes to Albacore on X.\n  5. Restart your computer.\n\nMicrosoft's ongoing fight against local accounts in consumer versions of\nWindows annoys pretty much everyone, including Elon Musk. However, Windows 10\nstill offers a relatively easy way to bypass the MSA requirement during the\ninitial setup. Windows 11, on the other hand, won't let you use a local\nprofile unless you know a magic command (oobe\\bypassnro).\n\n#### Tags\n\n  * Microsoft\n  * Windows 10\n  * Msa\n  * Microsoft account\n  * Settings app\n  * Windows 10 release preview\n  * Build 19045.4353\n\nLike\n\nPost\n\nShare\n\nReport a problem with article\n\nNext Article\n\n### Alleged 'AI Explorer' system requirements spotted inside Windows 11\nversion 24H2 code\n\nPrevious Article\n\n### KB5037941: Microsoft quietly releases Windows 11 build 26100.2 for Windows\n11 24H2 PCs\n\n### Related Stories\n\n### Micosoft Account notifications are part of Windows 10 22H2 Release Preview\nbuild 19045.4353\n\nJohn Callaham \u00b7 Apr 15, 2024 with 0 comment s\n\n### Windows 11 is finally getting a Settings page for managing your PCs and\nconsoles\n\nTaras Buria \u00b7 Apr 13, 2024 with 7 comment s\n\n### Microsoft adds even more widgets to Windows 10 lock screen\n\nTaras Buria \u00b7 Mar 20, 2024 with 14 comment s\n\n### Microsoft nudges you to upgrade to Windows 11 with Window 10 (KB5035941)\nBuild 19045.4235\n\nSayan Sen \u00b7 Mar 19, 2024 with 13 comment s\n\nFrom the WebPowered by ZergNet\n\nIf Hitler Had Won WW2, These Were His Plans For The US\n\nWe Might Know Where Human Teeth Came From & We Can't Sleep Now\n\nNicolas Cage Has A Car So Rare It Feels Illegal To Look At It\n\nHelldivers 2's Wild Super Credit Glitch Explained\n\n### Subscribe to our Newsletter\n\n### Community Activity\n\nRefresh\n\n  * TAM.. in The Hobby Corner\n  * The new robot from Boston Dynamic in Back Page News\n  * NASA Commercial Crew (CCtCap) test milestones in Science News & Discussion\n  * Neowin's 2024 Desktop Thread in General Discussion\n  * [How To] Switch Your Windows 11 System Region to the EEA Without Clean Installation in Essential Guides\n\n### Software Stories\n\n### RoboForm 9.5.8\n\n### Windows Firewall Control 6.9.9.8\n\n### PDF Shaper Free 14.1\n\n### Blender 4.1.1\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n### Windows tweaking app WinToys gets a big update with new features and\nimprovements\n\n### Windows 10 will soon start nagging you to switch from local account to\nMicrosoft Account\n\n### Microsoft: Windows Copilot app we quietly installed is harmless and\ndoesn't steal your data\n\n### Five cool features coming soon to Windows 11\n\n### Join the conversation!\n\nLogin or Sign Up to read and post a comment.\n\n## 29 Comments - Add comment\n\n### Report Comment\n\nClose\n\nPlease enter your reason for reporting this comment.\n\nreview\n\n### Dangbei Atom, a HDR10/HLG laser projector with Dolby sound, Chromecast,\nGoogle TV and more\n\ndangbei\n\nBeta Channel\n\n### Windows 11 22635.3495 adds Start menu recommendations and more\n\nwindows 11 insider preview promo\n\nCanary and Dev Channel\n\n### Windows 11 26100 fixes a few known issues\n\nwindows 11 insider preview promo\n\nThis Week in Rocket Launches #160\n\n### ULA's Delta IV Heavy took off for the very last time, see it here\n\ntwirl 160\n\nreview\n\n### Gulikit KK3 Max - premium controller with refined performance almost all\nthe time\n\ngulikit\n\nreview\n\n### Edifier NeoBuds Pro 2: Superb audio in a premium package snubbed by\nbattery life\n\nedifier\n\nreview\n\n### The Oukitel RT8 is a 20,000mAh rugged tablet with 48 MP camera\n\noukitel rt8\n\nreview\n\n### GameSir Nova, with hall effect sticks, 250Hz Bluetooth & A+ calibration\n\ngamesir\n\nreview\n\n### Edifier STAX SPIRIT S3 Planar Magnetic headphones \u2014 magnets how worky?\n\nstax\n\nguide\n\n### How to turn off the new ads in Discord, even without Nitro\n\ndiscord\n\n### Company\n\n  * Contact Us\n  * About Us\n  * Write for Neowin\n  * Advertising\n\n### Community\n\n  * Forums\n  * Subscribe\n  * Chat on IRC\n  * Neowin Deals\n\n### Social\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * YouTube\n  * Mastodon\n  * RSS\n\n### Partners\n\n  * Star Control\n  * Fences\n  * Brad Wardell\n  * Store\n\n  * DMCA Policy \u00b7\n  * Terms of Use \u00b7\n  * Privacy Statement\n\n\u00a9 Since 2000 Neowin\u00ae All trademarks mentioned are the property of their\nrespective owners.\n\nTop of Page\n\nLoading\n\n", "frontpage": true}
