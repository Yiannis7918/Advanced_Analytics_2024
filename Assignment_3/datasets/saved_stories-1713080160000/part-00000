When a dam fails, the\nresulting sudden release of a large volume of water is known as an outburst\nflood, having catastrophic consequences on the environment and communities\ndownstream. Such events are seemingly becoming more common as glaciers retreat\nand meltwater accumulates in larger and more numerous glacial lakes, due to\nclimate change.\n\nOftentimes, the ground shaking from earthquakes has been associated with\ntriggering glacial lake outbursts by disrupting the integrity of the dam. The\nseismic activity can also trigger destabilization of surrounding slopes,\nresulting in avalanches of rock debris that displaces water in the dam and\novertops it. However, a new study published in Geophysical Research Letters\nsuggests that this may not be the case and triggering processes could be much\nmore complicated.\n\nDr. Joanne Wood, a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Exeter,\nand colleagues investigated glacial lakes in the tropical Peruvian and\nBolivian Andes, South America, and the record of outburst events associated\nwith earthquakes. They found that of 59 earthquakes occurring between 1900 and\n2021 near glacial lakes, only one resulted in an outburst flood.\n\nReflecting on the current global record for glacial lake outbursts triggered\nby earthquakes, Dr. Wood states that only 11 can be confidently linked to this\nassociation (occurring in Peru, Nepal and Switzerland), six of which are\nassociated with a single magnitude 7.9 earthquake in May 1970 in the\nCordillera Blanca mountain range of Peru, which destabilized predominantly\nmoraine-dammed lakes.\n\nClearly, despite the intuitive link between seismic activity destabilizing\ndams to cause catastrophic floods, the local Andes and global evidence so far\ndoes not empirically support the assumption.\n\nTo test this further, the research team used the United States Geological\nSurvey Catalog to identify 11,733 earthquakes of magnitude >4 and 67\ntemporally known glacial lake outburst floods since the beginning of 1900.\nThese flood events were then split into four categories to determine if there\nwas a temporal lag from a seismic trigger by assessing if they occurred on the\nsame day as an earthquake, within a month, within six months or within a year.\n\nThe scientists used this dataset to investigate four processes associated with\nearthquakes and why these did not trigger glacial lake outburst floods (except\nfor the 1970 anomaly):\n\nLocations of 59 earthquakes since 1900 that intersect glacier lakes in the\nPeruvian and Bolivian Andes, South America. Circle colors pertain to\nearthquake magnitude while size is the critical distance from the epicenter.\nThe yellow circle refers to the 1970 Cordillera Blanca earthquake that\ntriggered six glacial lake outburst floods. Credit: Wood et al. 2024.\n\n  1. Landslides triggering moraine overtopping: For the 1970 event, five out of the six outburst floods were triggered by mass movements, but Dr. Wood and colleagues suggest that the smaller size of glacial lakes may mean that this does not cause water displacement as much as it would in blocking a river system, for example.\n  2. Shaking disturbs moraines: Seismic body waves (P and S waves traveling through Earth's inner layers) dissipate as they reach valley floors where glacier lakes occur, while surface waves may be blocked by some types of topography. Reduced shaking reaching moraines means they are less likely to collapse, and small movements may even be beneficial to reduce porosity and permeability to increase stability.\n  3. Liquefaction: Loosely consolidated and water saturated sediments are susceptible to liquefaction, whereby the ground surface loses strength and overlying structures sink into it. Vulnerable sediments are comprised of course silt, fine sand and gravel, which are all generally smaller than the constituents of dam-forming moraines.\n  4. Faulting: Glacier lake dams tend not to have major faults running through them to initiate points of failure and drainage, and if faults do intersect the lake, they tend to not be expressed at the surface.\n\nConsidering the 1970 anomaly once more, Dr. Wood and colleagues suggest that\nthis earthquake triggered thousands of rockfalls, rockslides and soilslides\ninto lakes across three valleys comprised of deeply weathered granitoids that\nhad been destabilized by frost wedging. This is the process by which water\nflows into cracks, freezes and causes expansion, thus opening the crack\nfurther.\n\nBeyond the water displacement theory and these being mostly moraine-dammed\nlakes instead of bedrock-dammed, like the rest of the Peruvian lakes, is\nprecisely why the 1970 event was so catastrophic in terms of glacial lake\noutburst floods requires further investigation.\n\nHowever, this research is important as it challenges the conception of\nearthquakes as the major driver of glacial lake outburst floods, and suggests\nthat more research needs to be conducted to determine the primary driver\n(potentially permafrost and structural geology) in order to help hazard\nassessments mitigate against the impacts on the local environment,\ninfrastructure and communities.\n\nMore information: Joanne L.
