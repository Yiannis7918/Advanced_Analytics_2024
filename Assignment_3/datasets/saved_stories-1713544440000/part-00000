If you have seen our Project\nTinyMiniMicro series, some of the processors, the AMD Ryzen Pro 8000 series,\nwill find their way into those systems from companies like Lenovo, HP, and\nDell. Some of the other processors, the AMD Ryzen Pro 8040 series, are more\noften found in notebooks and mini PCs. This generation has something\nsubstantially new, at least in some of the SKUs.\n\n## AMD Ryzen Pro 8000 and Ryzen Pro 8040 Series Launched\n\nThe first is the AMD Ryzen Pro 8000 series. These are AMD Zen 4 cores, RDNA 3\nintegrated graphics, and XDNA NPUs in 4nm 35W-65W packages. We still get a\nmaximum of 8 cores and 16 threads, but we get clock speeds up to 5.1GHz on the\nRyzen 7 models and only slightly slower for the Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 3. Something\nthat is important, is that when you see an asterisk next to the model number,\nthat means the SKUs do not have the NPU for AMD Ryzen AI. Only half of AMD\u2019s\nnew desktop SKUs have AI acceleration.\n\nAMD Ryzen Pro 8000 Series Specs\n\nOn the mobile side, we get more SKUs and only one that does not have the NPU.\nThe AMD Ryzen Pro 8040 series has nine models and anywhere from 15-54W TDPs.\nIt is a bit strange, but on average, the mobile SKUs have more cores and the\nRyzen 9 can even have higher clocks than the desktop series, and they are more\nlikely to have NPUs.\n\nAMD Ryzen Pro 8040 Series Specs\n\nSince we have seen Zen 4 and RDNA 3 before, the NPU is probably the most\ninteresting feature.\n\nAMD Ryzen Pro 7 7840U AI Inference Performance\n\nWe are now seeing AMD with a competitive performance slide on AI inference\nversus Intel, albeit using a Ryzen Pro 7840U instead of the newer parts that\nwere the topic of the launch.\n\n## Final Words\n\nSomething strange has happened in the market. AMD powered some of our favorite\n1L PCs, without any doubt. At the same time, HP and Lenovo have seemed to\nnotably cut back on promoting new AMD models. Dell was largely late to the AMD\n1L PC market, but the HP and Lenovo boxes were very good. It almost feels like\nseeing that plus the mobile SKUs looking so much more attractive that AMD has\nde-emphasized the commercial desktop market below Threadripper, and instead\nfocused on mobile parts.\n\n  * TAGS\n  * amd\n  * AMD Ryzen\n  * RDNA 3\n  * Ryzen\n  * Zen 4\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nPinterest\n\nLinkedin\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\nCopy URL\n\nPrevious articleNVIDIA RTX A400 and RTX A1000 Lower-Cost Single Slot GPUs\n\nNext articleIntel Foundry High NA EUV Milestone Readies for 14A Production\n\nCliff Robinson\n\nThey call me \"the STH news guy\" for a reason.\n\n#### RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR\n\n### NVIDIA GTC 2024 Keynote Coverage New CPUs GPUs and More\n\n### AMD Embedded Plus Announced\n\n### Apple M3 Family of CPUs Launched with Some Shaky Performance Claims\n\n#### 2 COMMENTS\n\n  1. Eric Olson April 18, 2024 At 8:53 am\n\nDid all the 8xxx series processors really drop support for system-level ECC\nmemory? From a home server point of view ECC could be a more significant\nfeature compared to a low-precision matrix unit used for neural network\ninference on the desktop.\n\n  2. Damian April 18, 2024 At 11:20 pm\n\nWhen I look at the marketing pics, then I realize that AMD did make a blunder\nthere on the AI performance. \u201cTime to First Token\u201d should me smaller to\nconvince me to buy it, yet it is \u201c+79%\u201d, so almost 2x as slow as Intel\ncompetitor.\n\n### LEAVE A REPLY\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
