How to Get Started!\n\nPublished May 8th, 2017 by Andy\n\n# New to DJing? How to Get Started!\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking of DJing, and you\u2019re anything like me, it can all seem a\nbit overwhelming. What equipment should you use? How does everything plug\ntogether? What music should you play! How do you find new music? How do you\nknow what will work for dancing and what won\u2019t? How do you know what to play\nwhen? What do you do if you play a song and everyone stops dancing? What\nif....\n\nThe list goes on and on... and if you\u2019re worrying about any of this stuff,\nthen good! These are all good questions \u2013 just don\u2019t wait until you get all\nthe answers before you begin. Many of the answers come with experience, and\nthat\u2019s the thing you most need. In other words....\n\n## Just Get Started\n\nYou can\u2019t know everything before you start. So... just start. Try a short set\nat your local scene \u2013 something nice and low key, and give it a go! Don\u2019t\nworry too much about the myriad of complex details \u2013 these will come. That\nsaid... there\u2019s a few things you\u2019ll need. So here\u2019s some of the bare\nessentials.\n\n### You Need\n\n  * A laptop\n  * The right software\n  * Some music\n\nOptional Extras\n\n  * Headphones\n  * External sound card\n\nSo far so simple. Let\u2019s look at these in a little more depth.\n\n## The Laptop\n\nThis is the easy one. People use anything from a MacBook Pro (overkill, yes,\nbut solid, high-quality, reliable, and as a die-hard Mac user my machine of\nchoice) to cheap and cheerful netbooks to tablets to (well \u2013 I did play a\nthree hour set from an iPhone once, and that is one setup I do not recommend)\nNext...\n\n## Software\n\nAgain \u2013 this is very much a matter of choice \u2013 but it\u2019s one you can play\naround with a little before setting down on what you want to use, and I\u2019d\nadvise you to at least try out a few different options to find something that\nyou personally enjoy working with. Also \u2013 use tools that are fit for purpose \u2013\nin other words, there is a world of difference between DJing software and a\nstraightforward music playing application such as iTunes or Spotify. I use\nMegaseg, which I\u2019ll talk about in future posts. Other popular players include\nMixxx, DJay, and Foobar2000 \u2013 that\u2019s a fairly random mix, but it\u2019s worth\nplaying with a few different ones to get a feel for how they work. Mixxx and\nFoobar are freebies, and most others have demos that you can play with.\n\nYou\u2019re also going to need something that lets you determine the speed (BPM \u2013\nBeats Per Minute) of each track. Some pieces of DJing software will help with\nthis, although beware of any that try to do it automatically \u2013 they\u2019ll work\nwell for thud-thud-thud club music, but the subtleties of swing can defeat\nthem. I use an iTunes plugin which lets me tap out the BPM of a tune \u2013 and I\ncan also do the same using Megaseg.\n\n## Headphones / External Sound Card\n\nI classed these as \u201coptional extras\u201d \u2013 but this only holds true until you\ndecide you\u2019re serious about DJing. Then the headphones become essential for\nmost DJs, and the external sound card becomes essential for everyone. In\nsummary \u2013 with headphones, you can preview songs while playing, which is a\nmassive help for choosing what to play next... and an external sound card is\na) an essential part of this process, and b) can hugely improve the sound\nquality you get from your laptop. And however good your laptop is, I guarantee\nthat the built-in sound quality isn\u2019t good enough.\n\nI\u2019m not going to labour this point any more in here, as I\u2019ve covered it\nbefore, and I\u2019ll no doubt be covering it again \u2013 so here\u2019s a useful post to\nread... and let\u2019s move on.\n\n## This covers your tools\n\nIt boils down to this:\n\n  1. Getting the music\n  2. Playing the music.\n\nSo the laptop / software / other bits are simply the tools of the trade, and\ngive you the means to play the music. Which is, of course, the easy bit. This\nleads to the first of the harder bits...\n\n## Finding the Music\n\nThe million dollar commodity \u2013 and this is a topic which multiple posts on\nmultiple blogs couldn\u2019t even begin to address \u2013 although I do try from time to\ntime... but here\u2019s a few small tips on how to start building a good\ncollection.\n\nA big thing for me when I started was trying to figure out what to play. Was\nthis song really swing? Was that song a bit too rock-and-roll? This one\u2019s\ndefinitely swing, but sounds.... too twee for want of a better term.... and so\non and so forth. Don\u2019t be too impatient \u2013 this is stuff you will learn, but\nplease do set out to learn it. Anyway \u2013 some bits of advice:\n\n  * Don\u2019t be impatient to build a huge collection. There can be a huge temptation to add new songs that are maybe kind of OKish just to try and increase your DJing collection because you haven\u2019t got enough songs. I\u2019m still weeding out tracks I added in ten years ago which I added just for that reason. And have never played since. Take it slow. Be selective. It\u2019s better to have a small collection of songs that are all great for dancing, than a huge collection of mixed quality.\n  * Get the classics. There\u2019s a reason we dance to so much Basie, Ellington, Chick Webb, Artie Shaw, Cab Calloway, Jimmy Lunceford, Benny Goodman and so on. Even if you don\u2019t (yet) know what that reason is \u2013 I certainly didn\u2019t when I started DJing \u2013 you need to start exploring the greats.\n  * Don\u2019t get too adventurous too soon. Before we can break the rules, we need to know the rules, and we need to respect the rules. If you read much of this blog, you\u2019ll know my views on the swing dance / swing vs non-swing music debate \u2013 and if you\u2019re DJing for swing dances, you have a real responsibility to play music that fits. If you don\u2019t get why the use of swing is important, it\u2019s time to learn. If you don\u2019t believe swing music is important, it could be that you\u2019re learning the wrong dance....\n  * Listen to as much swing as you possibly can. If you want to get good at this, your ears are going to need a regular diet of swing \u2013 not just when dancing, but all the time. I\u2019m lucky enough to be able to listen to Spotify at work, but I\u2019ll often listen to stuff on the way to work, at home, in the car....\n  * Really listen to songs. Listen properly. Feel how you respond to songs \u2013 do they make you want to dance? Fall asleep? Eat pistachos? What\u2019s the structure of each song? Are there breaks? What instruments really stand out to you? And so on... this helps get you really familiar with your collection, which is going to help when you\u2019re choosing songs.\n  * BPM your collection. For Lindy Hop, you are going to need to know the speed of every single song in your DJ collection. Start doing this right away, and do it religiously \u2013 do not do what a friend of mine did, and build up a collection of 3000 songs for DJing, then start working out BPMs. It can take months, and it\u2019s very very boring.\n\n## Playing the Music\n\nI\u2019ve talked about this a fair amount on this blog, and in my various\npresentations... but like many things it can boil down to a few basic\nprinciples.\n\n  * Get away from playlists. Anyone can slap on a playlist and let it play. A DJ is there to respond to the floor, and give it what it needs. A playlist can\u2019t do this. So... to begin with, it will be more stressful to choose songs on the fly, but if you want to learn to DJ well, take the plunge. Live on the edge. It\u2019s so much more rewarding...\n  * Watch the floor. Watch the dancers. Enjoy the dancing. Watch what they\u2019re doing. Watch how they respond to the music. Are they being creative and musical, or are they just plodding along to the beat? Are they bursting with energy, or looking tired? All this is, with experience, going to start feeding into your DJing choices, but to get to the point where this will happen, you need to start watching the floor.\n  * Keep things varied. At a swing dance, you\u2019ll generally be playing to a wide range of abilities of dancer, with a wide range of musical styles at your fingertips. Keep it mixed up. You need to provide something for everyone.\n  * Try to keep a sense of flow. Not easy to begin with, especially given the apparent contradiction that we want to keep things varied \u2013 but I\u2019ve always preferred to keep people on a flowing musical journey, than play a set of disjointed songs. There\u2019s a few different ways people like to do this \u2013 but the most common, and my preferred fallback method is to work the wave. That\u2019s a post in itself \u2013 expect that one next.\n  * Have fun! DJing swing dance events is not going to bring you fame, riches, limelight, status, sexual propositions or anything else of that nature (although it will get you noticed pretty quickly whenever something goes wrong \u2013 which it inevitably will, as it does for everyone) On the other hand, it is an amazing kick to be playing for a vibrant dancefloor, and DJing can be an amazing experience, if you let it. So throw caution to the winds, soak up the atmosphere you\u2019re creating, and have fun with it.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nI\u2019ve tried to keep this fairly light, accessible, and not overwhelm you with\ntoo much detail \u2013 but I have explored much of this stuff in more depth in\nprevious posts, and in my talks \u2013 and do plan on expanding on this in future\nposts.\n\nI\u2019m also aware that not all this advice will be for everyone \u2013 much depends on\nwhy you\u2019re DJing \u2013 whether you just need to play a few songs for some classes\nor class nights, or whether you want to become a full-blown event DJ. And\nwhichever route you\u2019re planning, it\u2019s hard to take all this at once and run\nwith it \u2013 so take it slow.\n\nA few parting suggestions:\n\n  * Practice. Practice setting up your gear, so you\u2019re comfortable with it. Practice playing music with your chosen software. Get familiar with it, so you\u2019re not fighting hardware / software issues when under fire (so to speak)\n  * Learn your music. Listen to your collection whenever you can. The more familiar you are with it, the easier DJing will be.\n  * Have fun! Yes \u2013 I said it before, but it\u2019s probably the most important thing here. So above all, you have to aim to have a blast!\n\nWhen all else is said and done, this is why we do it.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n#### Andy\n\nDJing General rambles Music\n\n## Be First to Comment\n\n### Leave a ReplyCancel reply\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
