Two\ndecades after it first hit the shelves, the author of Tomorrow, and Tomorrow,\nand Tomorrow celebrates its daring, dazzling appeal\n\nGabrielle Zevin\n\nShare\n\nPity the writer who believes they have written the next Cloud Atlas! A\nliterary agent once told me that when a fledgling writer compares their novel\nto David Mitchell\u2019s, he invariably knows it will be awful. Once you have\nwritten a book like Cloud Atlas, you have not written Cloud Atlas because\nCloud Atlas is not like anything.\n\nWhen the novel was published in 2004, critics compared it to everything. AS\nByatt in the Guardian invokes Herman Melville, Raymond Chandler, Martin Amis,\nGeorge Orwell and Ursula K Le Guin among others. Tom Bissell in the New York\nTimes adds to the mix Cervantes, Defoe, Isherwood, William S Burroughs, and,\nin a last paragraph twist, James Joyce\u2019s Ulysses. Theo Tait of the Telegraph\nwrites in a rare negative review that \u201cCloud Atlas spends half its time\nwanting to be The Simpsons and the other half the Bible.\u201d This line is funny\nmore than apt, but had I read it at the time, it would have sold the book to\nme.\n\nFor fun, I\u2019ll add Orlando, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Mitchell\u2019s previous novels,\nand Italo Calvino\u2019s metafictional masterpiece, If on a Winter\u2019s Night a\nTraveller. Mitchell read Calvino\u2019s novel at university, and said he sees Cloud\nAtlas as \u201cin conversation\u201d with Calvino, who, in turn, saw his work as\n\u201cclearly\u201d influenced by Vladimir Nabokov. Of course, this is how fiction works\n\u2013 time-travelling conversations between introverts who mostly will never meet.\n\nIf on a Winter\u2019s Night a Traveller features a sequence of intercalary first\nchapters, from novels of different genres, with narratives that interrupt at\nthe climax. Cloud Atlas is like If on a Winter\u2019s Night a Traveller but\ndoubled, reversed and with greater resolution: an answer to Calvino\u2019s prompt.\nLike Mitchell, I read it at university, and while I see its DNA in retrospect,\nI didn\u2019t think of it even once when I read Cloud Atlas almost 20 years ago. To\nthe point, it doesn\u2019t matter what references Mitchell is making, or what\nassociations a reader finds in the text. The point is the way Cloud Atlas\ntriggers memories of prior reading experiences. A reader of Cloud Atlas is\nasked to bring the experience of every other thing they have read.\n\nCloud Atlas\u2019s six main characters are connected by a comet-shaped birthmark,\nwhich may or may not be evidence that they are reincarnated versions of each\nother. Chapter four\u2019s Timothy Cavendish dismisses the notion as \u201cfar too\nhippie-druggy-new age\u201d. And yet, I believe these characters, who are of\ndifferent times, genders, races and circumstances, can be the same person\nbecause they come from the same person, the novelist who wrote them. If humans\ncontain Whitman\u2019s multitudes, novels also have the possibility to contain\nmultitudes, and they should.\n\n> The novel is less like a Russian doll than a daisy chain of laser-cut paper\n> dolls holding hands across unequally spaced wormholes\n\nI would have once described Cloud Atlas as a book about storytelling, but now\nI see it more precisely as a story of language and the way it evolves. As a\nreader, I take no pains to avoid spoilers, and the first time I read Cloud\nAtlas, I had already been told its structure. I envy a reader who comes to\nthis novel blank now, if such a person even exists. The reader who doesn\u2019t\nknow if she will ever read the end of The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing when\nit breaks off mid-sentence. I imagine them yelling, Curse you, David Mitchell!\nYou can\u2019t do this! Will Ewing die at sea? And who the hell is Robert\nFrobisher? Part of the delight of Cloud Atlas comes from solving it. The\nreader is enlisted as a detective in a textual mystery: what connects Ewing to\nFrobisher to Luisa Rey etc?\n\n\u201cRussian doll\u201d is the term most often used to describe the novel\u2019s nested\nstructure, but that suggests one of the narratives is the largest, and each\nsubsequent narrative takes up progressively less space. In Cloud Atlas, all\nnarratives are equally important. The novel is less like a Russian doll than a\nchain of paper dolls who are holding hands across unequally spaced wormholes,\nand who, at any moment, might be folded back into a stack.\n\nIn discussing Cloud Atlas, a reader may be pushed into revealing their\nfavourite section. I resist this question, though I\u2019ll concede that the\ncharacter I relate to the most is composer/amanuensis Frobisher, with his mix\nof grand ambition and humbling obscurity: \u201cI don\u2019t say I\u2019m a composer because\nI can no longer face the Moronic Inquisition: \u2018What kind of music do you\nwrite?\u2019; \u2018Oh, should I have heard of you?\u2019; \u2018Where do you get your ideas\nfrom?\u2019\u201d I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a novelist (or artist) on the planet who won\u2019t\nrecognise such an interrogation. However, the place I feel the strongest\nmelancholy is during Cavendish\u2019s chapters. It isn\u2019t because of Cavendish, a\ndelightfully poetic vulgarian, but because it is in the Cavendish section that\nwe receive proof that the characters we\u2019ve loved are fictions. \u201cLuisa Rey\u201d is\nrevealed to be a manuscript submission that Cavendish is reading, and if that\nis true, all associated with Luisa Rey are not real \u2013 the sudden deaths of\nFrobisher and Rufus Sixsmith, my heart! There should be a word for \u201cthe\nmelancholy that comes from learning that which is in a novel is fictional\u201d.\n\nOf course, the way readers address such melancholy is through cosplay, reader\nart, fan fiction and scholarship. Cloud Atlas has inspired all of these in\ngreat quantity. It is a response that one might expect to a bestselling\nfantasy series, a video game, or the unveiling of a Taylor Swift album; rarely\na literary novel. When I reread the book recently, I wondered how many readers\nhad got a tattoo of the comet birthmark. A perfunctory Google revealed an\nimpressive half-dozen, but there must be even more, unsearchable,\nunphotographed, waiting to be sprung on a lover. It begs the question, what\nmakes a novel tattoo-worthy? What makes a person want to make a literary\nreference on their body for ever, or at least as long as one\u2019s flesh lasts? It\nis the desire to make a fictional thing real in the world, and this only\nhappens when a book is beloved in a particular way.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Bookmarks\n\nFree weekly newsletter\n\nDiscover new books with our expert reviews, author interviews and top 10s.\nLiterary delights delivered direct you\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

(Timothy Cavendish again: \u201cAs if\nArt is the What, not the How!\u201d) But here goes. Six characters, who live in\ndifferent time periods, might be reincarnated versions of each other. Their\ncircumstances and forms change, but they play out the same conflicts.\nSometimes, they do a little better; sometimes, a little worse. The book\u2019s\nthemes include, but are not limited to, corporate greed, abuse of power,\nclimate change, colonialism, plastic surgery, AI, literary success and\nfailure, revolution, propaganda, credit and collaboration, appropriation,\nracism, adaptation, technology, ageism and gender. Mitchell has said the novel\nis about \u201cpredacity and predation\u201d and \u201cindividuals preying on groups\u201d, and,\nwhile this is undeniable, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s why people sign up for the\ntattoo.\n\nLet us briefly return to our fledgling novelist who has clumsily compared\ntheir book to Cloud Atlas. At times, I have been that novelist, at least in my\nown head, and I feel I can speak for us. We don\u2019t compare ourselves to Cloud\nAtlas because we necessarily think we\u2019ve written Cloud Atlas. It is because\nMitchell is the kind of writer we want to be, and Cloud Atlas is the kind of\nbook we want to write. It represents the possibilities for fiction \u2013 that\nthere are new stories and new ways to tell them, that there will be readers\nfor these new stories if only we can manage to be as brilliant as Mitchell.\nCloud Atlas is tricky and metafictional, but it is also hopeful and filled\nwith love. It is a book about the unexpected ways in which we are connected,\nbut it\u2019s clear-eyed about human nature. It is breathtakingly inventive every\ntime I read it. It probably shouldn\u2019t work. It is the kind of book that makes\na novelist attempt to write books that probably shouldn\u2019t work.\n\nGabrielle Zevin is the author of Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow\n(Vintage). A new edition of Cloud Atlas by David Mitchell, introduced by\nGabrielle Zevin, is published by Sceptre on 11 April.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Cloud Atlas\n  * David Mitchell\n  * Fiction\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Comments (...)\n\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Books\n  * Music\n  * TV & radio\n  * Art & design\n  * Film\n  * Games\n  * Classical\n  * Stage\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
