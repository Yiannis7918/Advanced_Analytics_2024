It passed without an amendment that would have required the FBI to\nobtain a warrant to access Americans\u2019 information.\n\nPhotograph: Samuel Corum/Getty Imahes\n\nA controversial US wiretap program days from expiration cleared a major hurdle\non its way to being reauthorized.\n\nAfter months of delays, false starts, and interventions by lawmakers working\nto preserve and expand the US intelligence community\u2019s spy powers, the House\nof Representatives voted on Friday to extend Section 702 of the Foreign\nIntelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) for two years.\n\nLegislation extending the program\u2014controversial for being abused by the\ngovernment\u2014passed in the House in a 273\u2013147 vote. The Senate has yet to pass\nits own bill.\n\nFeatured Video\n\nSection 702 permits the US government to wiretap communications between\nAmericans and foreigners overseas. Hundreds of millions of calls, texts, and\nemails are intercepted by government spies each with the \u201ccompelled\nassistance\u201d of US communications providers.\n\nThe government may strictly target foreigners believed to possess \u201cforeign\nintelligence information,\u201d but it also eavesdrops on the conversations of an\nuntold number of Americans each year. (The government claims it is impossible\nto determine how many Americans get swept up by the program.) The government\nargues that Americans are not themselves being targeted and thus the wiretaps\nare legal. Nevertheless, their calls, texts, and emails may be stored by the\ngovernment for years, and can later be accessed by law enforcement without a\njudge\u2019s permission.\n\nThe House bill also dramatically expands the statutory definition for\ncommunication service providers, something FISA experts, including Marc\nZwillinger\u2014one of the few people to advise the Foreign Intelligence\nSurveillance Court (FISC)\u2014have publicly warned against.\n\n\u201cAnti-reformers not only are refusing common-sense reforms to FISA, they\u2019re\npushing for a major expansion of warrantless spying on Americans,\u201d US senator\nRon Wyden tells WIRED. \u201cTheir amendment would force your cable guy to be a\ngovernment spy and assist in monitoring Americans\u2019 communications without a\nwarrant.\u201d\n\nThe FBI\u2019s track record of abusing the program kicked off a rare d\u00e9tente last\nfall between progressive Democrats and pro-Trump Republicans\u2014both bothered\nequally by the FBI\u2019s targeting of activists, journalists, and a sitting member\nof Congress. But in a major victory for the Biden administration, House\nmembers voted down an amendment earlier in the day that would\u2019ve imposed new\nwarrant requirements on federal agencies accessing Americans\u2019 702 data.\n\n\u201cMany members who tanked this vote have long histories of voting for this\nspecific privacy protection,\u201d says Sean Vitka, policy director at the civil-\nliberties-focused nonprofit Demand Progress, \u201cincluding former speaker Pelosi,\nRepresentative Lieu, and Representative Neguse.\u201d\n\nThe warrant amendment was passed earlier this year by the House Judiciary\nCommittee, whose long-held jurisdiction over FISA has been challenged by\nfriends of the intelligence community. Analysis by the Brennan Center this\nweek found that 80 percent of the base text of the FISA reauthorization bill\nhad been authored by intelligence committee members.\n\n\u201cThree million Americans' data was searched in this database of information,\u201d\nsays Representative Jim Jordan, chair of the House Judiciary Committee. \u201cThe\nFBI wasn't even following its own rules when they conducted those searches.\nThat's why we need a warrant.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Mike Turner, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee,\ncampaigned alongside top spy agency officials for months to defeat the warrant\namendment, arguing they\u2019d cost the bureau precious time and impede national\nsecurity investigations. The communications are legally collected and already\nin the government's possession, Turner argued; no further approval should be\nrequired to inspect them.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nThis Woman Will Decide Which Babies Are Born\n\nJason Kehe\n\n  * Politics\n\nInside the Election Denial Groups Planning to Disrupt November\n\nDavid Gilbert\n\n  * Security\n\nDuckDuckGo Is Taking Its Privacy Fight to Data Brokers\n\nMatt Burgess\n\n  * Business\n\nBeeper Took On Apple\u2019s iMessage Dominance. Now It\u2019s Been Acquired\n\nLauren Goode\n\n\u201cThe United States is at its greatest risk of terrorism in more than a decade\nfollowing the horrific October 7th attack on Israel, and the [intelligence\ncommunity] must focus attention and resources on that threat while continuing\nto stay ahead of China,\u201d Turner and Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House\nIntelligence Committee, said in a joint statement after the vote, adding that\n702 remains one of the country's most effective national security tools.\n\n\u201cIt allows the United States to counter our adversaries, like China and\nRussia, thwart potential terrorist attacks from ISIS, Al-Qaeda, Hamas, and\nHezbollah, and disrupt international drug cartels who are looking to smuggle\nfentanyl into our nation,\u201d they said.\n\nThe FBI introduced a slate of new internal policies to clamp down on the abuse\nitself, changes that the Biden administration argues are sufficient to ward\noff future abuse. Knowingly searching the database for information about\nAmericans requires analysts\u2014who must now submit to annual training sessions\u2014to\nseek approval from higher up the chain of command than before. Running batch\nqueries targeting Americans\u2019 communications now requires a consultation with a\ngovernment attorney.\n\nWhile opposing the search warrants, Turner backed a ban on searches of 702\ndata for criminal cases that lack any foreign element. While that amendment\nhas been welcomed by members on both sides of the issue, privacy hawks say the\nban is not quite the major reform that Turner has proclaimed. Data on the\nprogram made public by the FISC suggests the ban will in reality affect less\nthan a handful of cases each year.\n\nCritics of the program say that relying on the FBI to internally police\nagainst its own constitutional violations is a tactic that has failed in the\npast, and that the bureau can no longer be trusted not to spy on Americans\nwithout cause.\n\n\u201cSection 702 has been abused under presidents from both political parties, and\nit has been used to unlawfully surveil the communications of Americans across\nthe political spectrum,\u201d says Kia Hamadanchy, senior policy counsel at the\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union. \u201cThe Senate must add a warrant requirement and\nrein in this out-of-control government spying.\u201d\n\nJudiciary members had also sought to include an amendment banning the\ngovernment from buying Americans' geolocation data from private companies. At\nTurner\u2019s behest, House speaker Mike Johnson killed the amendment earlier in\nthe week.\n\nThe US Supreme Court has recognized geolocation data as protected from seizure\nby the \u201cprobable cause\u201d standard. Rather than begin applying for warrants, the\ngovernment has circumvented the ruling in many cases, buying up GPS data from\ncompanies that consumers largely believe are tracking them purely for\nadvertising purposes.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re buying data. That\u2019s what they\u2019re doing,\u201d says Warren Davidson, a\nRepublican congressperson from Ohio. \u201cThey\u2019re structuring markets to collect\nthe data and they\u2019re circumventing the Fourth Amendment. We need to turn that\noff.\u201d\n\n## You Might Also Like ...\n\n  * Navigate election season with our Politics Lab newsletter and podcast\n\n  * Think Google\u2019s \u201cIncognito mode\u201d protects your privacy?
