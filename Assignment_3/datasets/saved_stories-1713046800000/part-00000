In April, a next-\ngeneration solar sail technology \u2013 known as the Advanced Composite Solar Sail\nSystem \u2013 will launch aboard Rocket Lab\u2019s Electron rocket from the company\u2019s\nLaunch Complex 1 in M\u0101hia, New Zealand. The technology could advance future\nspace travel and expand our understanding of our Sun and solar system.\n\nSolar sails use the pressure of sunlight for propulsion, angling toward or\naway from the Sun so that photons bounce off the reflective sail to push a\nspacecraft. This eliminates heavy propulsion systems and could enable longer\nduration and lower-cost missions. Although mass is reduced, solar sails have\nbeen limited by the material and structure of the booms, which act much like a\nsailboat\u2019s mast. But NASA is about to change the sailing game for the future.\n\nNASA\u2019s Advanced Composite Solar Sail System seeks to advance future space\ntravel and expand our understanding of our Sun and Solar System. Credits:\nNASA\u2019s Ames Research Center\n\n### NASA\u2019s New Lightweight Sailor\n\nThe Advanced Composite Solar Sail System demonstration uses a twelve-unit\n(12U) CubeSat built by NanoAvionics to test a new composite boom made from\nflexible polymer and carbon fiber materials that are stiffer and lighter than\nprevious boom designs. The mission\u2019s primary objective is to successfully\ndemonstrate new boom deployment, but once deployed, the team also hopes to\nprove the sail\u2019s performance.\n\nLike a sailboat turning to capture the wind, the solar sail can adjust its\norbit by angling its sail. After evaluating the boom deployment, the mission\nwill test a series of maneuvers to change the spacecraft\u2019s orbit and gather\ndata for potential future missions with even larger sails.\n\n\u201cBooms have tended to be either heavy and metallic or made of lightweight\ncomposite with a bulky design \u2013 neither of which work well for today\u2019s small\nspacecraft. Solar sails need very large, stable, and lightweight booms that\ncan fold down compactly,\u201d said Keats Wilkie, the mission\u2019s principal\ninvestigator at NASA\u2019s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. \u201cThis\nsail\u2019s booms are tube-shaped and can be squashed flat and rolled like a tape\nmeasure into a small package while offering all the advantages of composite\nmaterials, like less bending and flexing during temperature changes.\u201d\n\nMariano Perez, quality assurance engineer at NASA Ames, inspects the Advanced\nComposite Solar Sail System spacecraft. When the composite booms and solar\nsail deploy in orbit, they will measure about 860 square feet (80 square\nmeters) \u2013 about the size of six parking spots.

After approximately 25 minutes the\nsolar sail will fully deploy, measuring about 860 square feet (80 square\nmeters) \u2013 about the size of six parking spots. Spacecraft-mounted cameras will\ncapture the sail\u2019s big moment, monitoring its shape and symmetry during\ndeployment.\n\nWith its large sail, the spacecraft may be visible from Earth if the lighting\nconditions are just right. Once fully expanded and at the proper orientation,\nthe sail\u2019s reflective material will be as bright as Sirius, the brightest star\nin the night sky.\n\n\u201cSeven meters of the deployable booms can roll up into a shape that fits in\nyour hand,\u201d said Alan Rhodes, the mission\u2019s lead systems engineer at NASA\u2019s\nAmes Research Center in California\u2019s Silicon Valley. \u201cThe hope is that the new\ntechnologies verified on this spacecraft will inspire others to use them in\nways we haven\u2019t even considered.\u201d\n\nThis artist\u2019s concept shows the Advanced Composite Solar Sail System\nspacecraft sailing in space using the energy of the Sun. Credit: NASA/Aero\nAnimation/Ben Schweighart\n\n### Enabling Future Solar Sails\n\nThrough NASA\u2019s Small Spacecraft Technology program, successful deployment and\noperation of the solar sail\u2019s lightweight composite booms will prove the\ncapability and open the door to larger scale missions to the Moon, Mars, and\nbeyond.\n\nThis boom design could potentially support future solar sails as large as\n5,400 square feet (500 square meters), about the size of a basketball court,\nand technology resulting from the mission\u2019s success could support sails of up\nto 21,500 square feet (2,000 square meters) \u2013 about half a soccer field.\n\n\u201cThe Sun will continue burning for billions of years, so we have a limitless\nsource of propulsion. Instead of launching massive fuel tanks for future\nmissions, we can launch larger sails that use \u201cfuel\u201d already available,\u201d said\nRhodes. \u201cWe will demonstrate a system that uses this abundant resource to take\nthose next giant steps in exploration and science.\u201d\n\nBecause the sails use the power of the Sun, they can provide constant thrust\nto support missions that require unique vantage points, such as those that\nseek to understand our Sun and its impact on Earth. Solar sails have long been\na desired capability for missions that could carry early warning systems for\nmonitoring solar weather. Solar storms and coronal mass ejections can cause\nconsiderable damage on Earth, overloading power grids, disrupting radio\ncommunications, and affecting aircraft and spacecraft.\n\nComposite booms might also have a future beyond solar sailing: the lightweight\ndesign and compact packing system could make them the perfect material for\nconstructing habitats on the Moon and Mars, acting as framing structures for\nbuildings or compact antenna poles to create a communications relay for\nastronauts exploring the lunar surface.\n\n\u201cThis technology sparks the imagination, reimagining the whole idea of sailing\nand applying it to space travel,\u201d said Rudy Aquilina, project manager of the\nsolar sail mission at NASA Ames. \u201cDemonstrating the abilities of solar sails\nand lightweight, composite booms is the next step in using this technology to\ninspire future missions.\u201d\n\nNASA Ames manages the Advanced Composite Solar Sail System project and\ndesigned and built the onboard camera diagnostic system. NASA Langley designed\nand built the deployable composite booms and solar sail system. NASA\u2019s Small\nSpacecraft Technology (SST) program office based at NASA Ames and led by the\nagency\u2019s Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD), funds and manages the\nmission. NASA STMD\u2019s Game Changing Development program developed the\ndeployable composite boom technology. Rocket Lab USA, Inc of Long Beach,\nCalifornia is providing launch services. NanoAvionics is providing the\nspacecraft bus.\n\n## Share\n\n## Details\n\nLast Updated\n\nApr 11, 2024\n\n## Related Terms\n\n  * General\n  * Ames Research Center\n  * Langley Research Center\n  * Small Spacecraft Technology Program\n  * Space Technology Mission Directorate\n\n## Explore More\n\n23 min read\n\n### The NRP Post\n\nDive into the captivating history of the NASA Research Park (NRP) and its\nindustry partners...\n\nArticle 13 hours ago\n\n3 min read\n\n### Tech Today: Folding NASA Experience into an Origami Toolkit\n\nMath for designing lasers becomes artist\u2019s key to creating complex crease\npatterns\n\nArticle 1 day ago\n\n3 min read\n\n### A Langley Intern Traveled 1,340 Miles to View a Total Solar Eclipse.\nHere\u2019s What She Saw.\n\nArticle 3 days ago\n\nKeep Exploring\n\n## Discover More Topics From NASA\n\nSpace Technology Mission Directorate\n\nSTMD Small Spacecraft Technology\n\nGame Changing Development\n\nAmes Research Center\n\n### The National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of\nhumanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\n  * About NASA's Mission\n\nJoin Us\n\n  * Home\n  * News & Events\n  * Multimedia\n  * NASA+\n  * Missions\n  * Humans in Space\n  * Earth & Climate\n  * The Solar System\n  * The Universe\n  * Science\n  * Aeronautics\n  * Technology\n  * Learning Resources\n  * About NASA\n  * NASA en Espa\u00f1ol\n\n### Follow NASA\n\n  * More NASA Social Accounts\n  * NASA Newsletters\n\n  * Sitemap\n  * For Media\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * FOIA\n  * No FEAR Act\n  * Office of the IG\n  * Budget & Annual Reports\n  * Agency Financial Reports\n  * Contact NASA\n  * Accessibility\n\n  * Page Last Updated:\n\nApr 11, 2024\n\n  * Page Editor:\n\nTara Friesen\n\n  * Responsible NASA Official:\n\nAbigail Bowman\n\n", "frontpage": true}
