Okay, there are still some audible artifacts, and you\ncan argue that the song I linked to is generic if it makes you feel better.\nStill, as someone who\u2019s dabbled with music and composition and worked in the\nAI field for a while, this is incredibly impressive. We now have a software\nsystem that can crank out more catchy music than 99 out of 100 musicians, and\ndo it about 100,000 faster than a human could. The end game of AI music seems\npretty obvious. Soon, you\u2019ll be able to have access to an app like Spotify\nthat generates an endless stream of music tailored specifically to your unique\nand ever-changing personal tastes.\n\nAs with any technology, it will open many new possibilities. You may never\nhave to be in a situation where you can\u2019t find new music to listen to. It\u2019s\nalso now going to be within your reach to have an app generate multiple custom\npieces of music for your friend\u2019s birthday, incorporating all your favorite\ninside jokes. It also seems not too unrealistic that we could have an AI-\npowered Netfix eventually. What if you could have an endless TV series fully\ntailored to your preferences? What if that TV show could have you as a\ncharacter? I know that personally, I\u2019d love to watch 12 new seasons of Star\nTrek: The Next Generation. If I\u2019m being honest, I\u2019d probably watch 3 new\nepisodes every day, until I get so sick of Star Trek that I need to take a\nmulti-year break.\n\nEndless music and TV shows seem pretty exciting until you stop to think that\nSpotify pays artists less than half a cent per stream on average. More content\nseems better, but the online world already feels, in some ways, like some\nweird endless, borderline dystopian competition for attention. What\u2019s going to\nhappen if we throw content-generating machines into the mix? Surely, like me,\nyou\u2019ve already stumbled upon a number of AI-generated videos on YouTube.\nRemind yourself that this is just the beginning. Eventually, no matter how\nsmart and educated you are, you\u2019ll have genuine difficulty telling apart\nwhat\u2019s AI-generated and what\u2019s not. I\u2019m sure this makes you feel warm and\nfuzzy inside (that was sarcasm).\n\nI\u2019ve worked in an academic AI research lab for a few years. I genuinely\nbelieve that AI, as a technology, has tremendous potential. I dream of one day\nhaving a humanoid robot at home to keep my place clean, do my laundry, do home\nrepairs, and occasionally cook. I\u2019d really love to be able to spend more time\nwith friends and working on side-projects without ever having to worry about\ndoing chores. What if my AI-assistant could file my taxes for me? A world\nwithout chores or paperwork, wouldn\u2019t that be amazing? I\u2019m a bit scared of\nhaving children because of how much work it represents, and the huge resulting\nloss in free time. What if I could have a kid without ever having to change\ndiapers? Maybe the robot could even come up with clever games to teach my kid\nhow to read while also being physically active?\n\nThe potential for AI is truly exciting. It\u2019s truly the most transformative\ntechnology we\u2019ve ever created. The thing is though, that fundamentally, the\nmore AI and robotics technology advances, the more we\u2019re devaluing human\nlabor, and even human creativity. You can try to pretend that\u2019s not true, but\nwe all know that the end goal is to create machines that can do anything a\nhuman can. If we succeed, then eventually, there will be no task that a human\ncan do that a machine can\u2019t do better and more efficiently.\n\nWe\u2019re trying to create a world where we have access to infinite labor.\nEconomics dictate that as the supply for labor increases, its value must\ndecrease. You can say that\u2019s not true, because with infinite labor, the\neconomy can also grow to infinite size. The reality is, neither you or I have\na crystal ball. The socio-political ramifications are massive. AI is going to\ntransform the world in ways we can\u2019t predict. I understand why you might find\nthat exciting, but that excitement should also be tempered by an appropriate\namount of fear. We\u2019re on the verge of technological breakthroughs that have\nthe potential to necessitate a radical transformation of the worldwide\neconomic system, and make your own skills and creativity basically irrelevant.\n\nI\u2019ve watched a documentary about the lives of migrant workers living in\nShenzhen. A man, looking tired, was living in an illegal dwelling. It was a\ncube about 2m (6ft) on every side, with a bed and a tiny television. Long\nhours, gruelling work, no social life. What happens to these people when their\nwork can be automated? Do they instantly have access to UBI and food to eat?\n\nI\u2019ve also watched a documentary about the lives of Hikikomori in Japan. Shut-\nins who experience social anxiety, never leave home and often spend most of\ntheir time gaming. Thanks to technological progress, you can now get\ngroceries, clothing and household items delivered, get Uber Eats with no\nsocial contact. You can take courses online. Work remotely. Game in virtual\nreality. Substitute relationships and intimacy for a porn addiction. What if\nwe do get access to UBI? Is that going to turn our world into a utopia? Do you\nthink we\u2019ll all be sipping margaritas on the beach all day while giving each\nother back rubs? Are you going to be really motivated to learn to sing or play\nthe guitar if nobody cares to listen?\n\nI apologize if the tone of this post is dark. I generally consider myself an\noptimist, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s all that useful to engage in doomerism.\nHowever, I also think we\u2019re facing unprecedented change. The future is really\nhard to predict, this is a crazy experiment, and we don\u2019t necessarily get to\ntry it multiple times. So I\u2019d like to ask a few open-ended questions: is it\npossible to be simultaneously excited but also cautious? Can we acknowledge\nthat even without killer machines, there are real dangers here, if only\nbecause this is completely uncharted territory? How can we help humans remain\nboth physically and mentally healthy in a world where machines can potentially\ndo everything we do better than we can, the online world is saturated with\ncontent, and it\u2019s possible to live without any social contact?\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Reddit\n  * Facebook\n\nLike Loading...\n\nFrom \u2192 Artificial Intelligence, Psychology, Rant\n\n2 Comments\n\n  1. daria permalink\n\nHave you read Player Piano by Kurt Vonnegut Jr., published in 1952?\n\nReply\n\n     * Maxime Chevalier-Boisvert permalink\n\nI haven\u2019t.
