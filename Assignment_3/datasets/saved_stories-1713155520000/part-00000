Photograph: Amazon Game\nStudios\n\nGames\n\nThis article is more than 3 years old\n\n# Amazon, Google and why you can't just invent a blockbusting games developer\n\nThis article is more than 3 years old\n\nKeith Stuart\n\nThe failure of two online giants shows you can\u2019t just pour in money and watch\ngames pop out \u2013 a game studio culture takes time to develop\n\nShare\n\nIt was perhaps not the most surprising video game industry revelation of all\ntime. Last week, Bloomberg published an eviscerating expos\u00e9 on the\ndysfunctional culture at Amazon Game Studios, the development teams formed by\nthe online retail giant, which have so far failed to produce a single hit\ntitle for PC or consoles, despite recruiting a wealth of industry veterans.\nThe backstory as presented in the article is almost too predictable: Amazon\ntrusted its game studios to a company veteran, Mike Frazzini, with no\nexperience in game development, who greenlit expensive projects that chased\nalready successful titles (a League of Legends clone called Nova, a Fortnite\ncompetitor named Intensity) and ended up being cancelled. According to staff\nwho spoke to Bloomberg, the studios also adopted a \u201cbro culture\u201d in which\nfemale staff were belittled and sidelined. Bloomberg said they approached\nAmazon for a response, but a spokeswoman declined to comment or make Frazzini\navailable for an interview.\n\nThen came the news that Google would be closing its own game development\nstudios in Los Angeles and Montreal, neither of which have yet produced a game\nfor its Stadia streaming service. \u201cCreating best-in-class games from the\nground up takes many years and significant investment, and the cost is going\nup exponentially,\u201d wrote Stadia GM and vice president Phil Harrison in his\nblog post explaining the company\u2019s decision to focus on the platform rather\nthan on game development. But should this have come as a surprise to a man who\npreviously launched consoles at Microsoft and Sony? Possibly not.\n\nWhat this has shown is that a game development studio isn\u2019t something that can\nsimply be built and operated through the combination of financial investment\nand a few big-name talent acquisitions. You can\u2019t just pour in money at one\nend and watch blockbusting games pop out the other. One inconvenient factor\nthat seems to have been overlooked in both these cases is that, like a movie\nproduction team, or a sitcom writers\u2019 room, or an orchestra, or a repertory\ntheatre company, a games studio is a culture. It requires a combination of\nfactors, including a shared vision, a work ethic, a supportive environment, a\nsense of identity and purpose, which emerge not out of funding, but out of\ncreative relationships and trust. Frustratingly, you can\u2019t buy these things,\nthey develop.\n\nAs a games journalist, I have visited and written about hundreds of video game\nstudios all over the world. I have met ex-nuclear missile engineers working on\nflight simulators in Moscow, I\u2019ve met role-playing game makers in Tokyo and\nshoot-\u2019em-up creators in Dallas, Los Angeles and Amsterdam. And every\nsuccessful studio I\u2019ve ever spent time with has had one thing in common:\nthey\u2019re all different. Blizzard, the creator of the Warcraft and Starcraft\ntitles has a sprawling campus in Irvine, California that feels like a\nuniversity, with its beautiful wood-panelled library, its statues, its many\nfaculty buildings. Media Molecule in Guildford, creator of charming handicraft\ntitles LittleBigPlanet and Tearaway, feels like the modern approximation of\nOliver Postgate\u2019s animation studio \u2013 all singalongs and science nights and\nlife drawing workshops. When I visited the Call of Duty developer Infinity\nWard, it was like a combination of a teenager\u2019s bedroom and an underground\nhacking collective. Someone actually lived in the office. There was so much\nfree candy I spent the whole visit on a gigantic sugar rush.\n\nNobody designed these places to feel like this, it just happened; it evolved\nover time, and through the gauze of shared experiences. I love to visit Rare,\nthe studio in the Midlands that created Donkey Kong Country and Banjo-Kazooie\nand more recently Sea of Thieves. Located within acres of countryside, it\nfeels like a world unto itself, and it is staffed both by industry veterans\nwith decades of experience, and fresh-faced graduates and newcomers who talked\nto me about feeling heard and valued and a part of something truly enriching.\nI\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s something that can be purchased.\n\nWhen I worked in game development in the early 1990s, as a writer and QA\nassistant at Big Red Software in Leamington, we worked very closely with\nCodemasters, the developer of the Micro Machines and Colin McRae Rally games.\nThe company was based on a farm, with teams housed in barns and portable\nbuildings. It was ramshackle and chaotic, but it was also fun, and the people\nwho worked there felt like they belonged to something. It was the same as DMA\nDesign, the 1990s Dundee studio that created Grand Theft Auto, an anarchic\ncollective of talented ne\u2019er-do-wells who pitched crazed ideas based on the\nmovies they watched together, sparking eccentric projects into semi-life then\nditching them, but using those experiences to create better things. Grand\nTheft Auto emerged like a mutant from other failed designs and ideas, barely\nfunctioning, barely wanted by the publisher. Fortnite: Battle Royale evolved\nfrom a somewhat unsuccessful co-op zombie blaster, that itself emerged as a\ncreative side-project back in 2011. Minecraft was something a small team\nworked on while maintaining another game. Nobody slapped $2bn on a table and\nsaid \u201cmake me the digital version of Lego in two years\u201d.\n\nVideo games were projected to make $160bn in 2020, according to industry\nanalyst Newzoo. They have become the entertainment and cultural format of\nchoice for Generation Z, so of course major entertainment and retail\ncorporations want to get a creative grip on the sector. It is almost too\ncliched, too on the nose, the way Amazon and Google went at it with their\nexpensive test tube studios, the way they seem to have wanted to leverage\nTriple A game development in order to promote their other services and\ntechnologies \u2013 as though holistic business integration was ever enough to\nmotivate great art or even decent entertainment. Even the most soulless\nHollywood action blockbusters emerge from creative stables that bring\nparticular visions to the screen. You might think Jerry Bruckheimer and\nMichael Bay are hacks but you sure know when you\u2019re watching something they\nmade.\n\nModern major game development is a quagmire of dysfunctional working\npractices, where unreasonable crunch periods are still seen by many as the\nprice of brilliance. This is not a culture to be lauded. At the same time,\nhowever, formulating a successful team is not a cold and precise endeavour, it\nrelies on people gelling together, sparking ideas off each other, being\nwilling to try and iterate and try again. That\u2019s the process, that\u2019s how it\nworks. I have no doubt whatsoever that the Amazon and Google studios are\nfilled with talented, brilliant people, but even that\u2019s not enough without a\nsense of purpose and direction, without resources, without time. Money can buy\nart, but it can\u2019t in the end, simply generate it.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Games\n  * Google\n  * Amazon\n  * Game culture\n  * Game play\n  * Activision Blizzard\n  * comment\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Comments (...)\n\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Books\n  * Music\n  * TV & radio\n  * Art & design\n  * Film\n  * Games\n  * Classical\n  * Stage\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
