However, a meticulous\n> analysis of qualitative data often requires a significant amount of time,\n> especially during the crucial coding stage. Although there is software\n> specifically designed for qualitative evaluation, many of these platforms\n> fall short in terms of automatic coding, intuitive usability, and cost-\n> effectiveness. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3\n> and its successors, we are at the forefront of a transformative era for\n> enhancing qualitative analysis. In this paper, we introduce QualiGPT, a\n> specialized tool designed after considering challenges associated with\n> ChatGPT and qualitative analysis. It harnesses the capabilities of the\n> Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) and its API for thematic analysis of\n> qualitative data. By comparing traditional manual coding with QualiGPT's\n> analysis on both simulated and actual datasets, we verify that QualiGPT not\n> only refines the qualitative analysis process but also elevates its\n> transparency, credibility, and accessibility. Notably, compared to existing\n> analytical platforms, QualiGPT stands out with its intuitive design,\n> significantly reducing the learning curve and operational barriers for\n> users.\n\nComments:| 25 pages, 7 figures, 1 table, under review  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2310.07061 [cs.HC]  \n(or arXiv:2310.07061v1 [cs.HC] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2310.07061arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: He Zhang [view email] [v1] Tue, 10 Oct 2023 22:57:18 UTC (5,904 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled QualiGPT: GPT as an easy-to-use tool for\nqualitative coding, by He Zhang and 4 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.HC\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2310\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
