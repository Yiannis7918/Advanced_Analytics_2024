The explosion\nused 7400 tons (6700 metric tons) of surplus World War II ammunition, which\nwas placed in various locations around the island and detonated at 1 p.m. on\n18 April 1947 by the Royal Navy. The energy released was 1.3\u00d710^13 J, or about\n3.2 kilotons of TNT equivalent^[1] making it the largest artificial non-\nnuclear explosion at that time. The objective of the blast was to destroy the\nbunkers and military installations on the North Sea island of Heligoland, but\ndue to the enormous amount of explosives it was foreseen that the entire\nisland might be destroyed.^[2] The porous sandstone that makes up the island\nallowed the blast wave to escape so only the southern tip of the island was\ndestroyed, but there was considerable damage to the northern tip.\n\n## Background[edit]\n\nView of Heligoland before the destruction (circa 1920)\n\nBecause of its location in the centre of the German Bight, near the mouths of\nthe Weser, the Elbe, and the Kiel Canal, the waters around the island of\nHeligoland were the scene of four naval battles in 1849, 1864, 1914, and 1917.\nIn 1807, the United Kingdom occupied the island, which had previously belonged\nto Denmark. In 1890, in the so-called Heligoland-Zanzibar Treaty, the German\nEmpire exchanged German territorial claims in Africa for the island of\nHeligoland in order to develop it into a naval fortress and later a naval\nbase. According to the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, Article 115,\nthe fortress was to be destroyed after the First World War. The work lasted\nfrom 1920 to 1922, but was not as thorough as originally envisaged; the basic\nstructure was preserved.^[3] During the Nazi period (1938), the never-\ncompleted \"Project Lobster Claw\" (Projekt Hummerschere) was started to make\nthe island a military counterweight to the British naval base in Scapa Flow.\nAfter the end of World War II, the island was in the British occupation zone\nin Germany and served as a blasting and training ground between 1945 and 1952.\n\n## Explosion[edit]\n\nHuge blast crater on the south side of Heligoland, called Kringel (2020)\n\nIn April 1945, after a Royal Air Force bombing raid on Heligoland with about\n1,000 bombers occurred on 18 April, the approximately 2,500 inhabitants were\nevacuated by the Wehrmacht garrison.^[4] On 11 May 1945 the island was\noccupied by British forces.^[5] In order to deny the uninhabited islands to\nthe Germans as a potential naval base, the British began preparations to blow\nup the bunkers and military installations on Heligoland in 1947. They filled\nthe Nordsee III submarine bunker in the southern harbour and the tunnel\nlabyrinths with leftover munitions from the world wars. Since the preparations\ntook longer than planned, the original deadline of 31 March could not be\nmet.^[6]\n\nOn 18 April 1947, exactly two years after the bombing raid, the Royal Navy\ndetonated the bomb. Stacked were about 4,000 torpedo heads, nearly 9,000 depth\ncharges and over 91,000 shells of various calibres. The blast was set off by\nBritish engineers aboard HMS Lasso from a distance of about 17 kilometres. The\nBritish staged this blast for the German public; there was a separate brochure\nabout it. Almost 20 journalists watched directly from the steamer Danzig. A\nsmaller explosion was used to scare away the birds. The main explosion\noccurred a few minutes later. A huge jet of fire and tons of rock shot into\nthe sky. The tremors could still be felt in Cuxhaven, 70 kilometres away. The\nmushroom cloud rose about nine kilometres (according to other sources, one\nkilometre) into the air. The explosion shook the island base to a depth of\nseveral kilometres.\n\n## Results[edit]\n\nThe island survived the blast, but the southern tip of the island, the rubble\nof which makes up today's Mittelland, was blown away.^[7] Parts of the cliff\nalso collapsed, and many craters were created. The harbour facilities and\ncoastal protection walls remained intact, and the surviving civil air raid\nshelters today attract up to 10,000 tourists annually. The only building to\nsurvive the blast was the Flakturm, today's Heligoland Lighthouse.^[8] The\ndetonation could be registered seismographically in Germany and used to study\nthe Earth's crust.^[9] In 1952, after protests by the residents, the people of\nHeligoland were allowed to repopulate the island. Today, on the anniversary of\nthe demolition, a memorial service is held in the civil defence bunker.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Willmore, PL (1949). \"Seismic Experiments on the North German Explosions, 1946 to 1947\".
