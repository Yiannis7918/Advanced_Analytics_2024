Internally, Amazon wanted\njust 50 out of every 1,000 sales to get a manual check, according to the\nreport.\n\nRelated stories\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson disputed that claim in a statement to Business Insider,\nsaying that the team in India mostly helps train the model that the company\nused for Just Walk Out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Associates may also validate a small minority of shopping visits where our\ncomputer vision technology cannot determine with complete confidence an\nindividual's purchases,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe revelation comes as Amazon is planning to replace Just Walk Out at Amazon\nFresh stores with its Dash Carts, The Information reported.

The technology\nallowed customers to enter a store by identifying themselves with their Amazon\naccount. From there, they could pick up items, put them back on the shelves,\nand walk out with their final picks, all without having to interact with a\ncashier.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the last few years, Amazon has rolled Just Walk Out to larger-format\nstores.
