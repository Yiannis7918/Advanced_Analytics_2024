This is being sought\nin the name of greater Python performance on Fedora 41.\n\nRed Hat engineer Miro Hron\u010dok laid out the change proposal for compiling\nFedora 41's Python package using -O3 rather than -O2. This matches upstream\nPython's release builds going for -O3 while -O2 is just used on Fedora per the\ndistribution's default mandate.\n\nBy using -O3 rather than -O2, the Fedora Python package was found to deliver\n1.04x the performance overall but in some particular micro-benchmarks was as\nmuch as 1.08~1.16x the -O2 performance.\n\nThe only possible downside expressed so far is the possibility of a slightly\nlarger Python package but the disk space increase using the -O3 optimization\nlevel should be less than 2%.\n\nOverall it's a sane change for bettering the Python performance on Fedora.\nThis F41 change proposal still needs to clear the Fedora Engineering and\nSteering Committee (FESCo) but those interested in the current plans can find\nthem via the Fedora Wiki.\n\n10 Comments\n\nRelated News\n\nFESCo Approves The Fedora 41 Switch To DNF5\n\nFedora 42 Change Proposal Wants To Make KDE Plasma The Default Over GNOME\n\nFedora 41 Will Try Again To Switch To DNF5 Package Manager\n\nFedora 40 Beta Released With GNOME 46 & KDE Plasma 6.0 On Wayland Desktops\n\nFedora Linux 40 Beta Cleared For Release Next Week\n\nFedora Workstation 41 To No Longer Install GNOME X.Org Session By Default\n\nAbout The Author\n\nMichael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site\nin 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.
