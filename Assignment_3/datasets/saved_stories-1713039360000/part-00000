The\nupstream mailing list thread isn't resolving for any additional insight, but\nin any event this change just touches a dozen lines of code and is now queued\nvia x86/cpu for introduction in the Linux 6.10 merge window that will kick off\nin May.\n\n1 Comment\n\nRelated News\n\nLinux 6.10 SLUB Optimization To Reduce Memory Consumption In Extreme Scenarios\n\nLinux 6.8.5 & Other Stable Kernel Updates Due To Native BHI Vulnerability\n\nLinux 6.10 AES-XTS For Disk/File Encryption As Much As ~155% Faster For AMD\nZen 4 CPUs\n\nLinux 6.9-rc3 Released With Many Bcachefs Patches\n\nNew EEVDF Linux Scheduler Patches Make It Functionally \"Complete\"\n\nThe Linux Kernel Begins Preparing For Rust 1.78 Upgrade\n\nAbout The Author\n\nMichael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site\nin 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.
