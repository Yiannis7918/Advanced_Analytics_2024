Now, 50 of the published images are appearing\nin an outdoor public exhibition in London.\n\nThe selection of portraits, which are also collated online, features working\nresearchers in diverse and important fields. The exhibition is organized in\ncollaboration with Argent, a retail-management company based in London.\n\nThe images, commissioned especially for the journal, are on display in the\nKing\u2019s Cross area, near to Springer Nature\u2019s corporate offices in the United\nKingdom. The free exhibition aims to inspire younger generations to consider a\ncareer in science, technology, engineering or mathematics, and to challenge\nstereotypical preconceptions of what a scientist looks like and does. The\nportraits will remain on display until June 2024.\n\nThe exhibition is dedicated to Karen Kaplan, the senior careers editor who\nlaunched Where I Work in 2019, to mark Nature\u2019s 150th anniversary. Karen died\nin November 2023.\n\nNature 628, 922 (2024)\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01156-8\n\n## Related Articles\n\n  * Use these tips to take an amazing science photograph\n\n  * How I harnessed media engagement to supercharge my research career\n\n  * Digging in: last chance to save a native forest\n\n## Subjects\n\n  * Careers\n  * Publishing\n  * Arts\n\n## Latest on:\n\nDeadly diseases and inflatable suits: how I found my niche in virology\nresearch\n\nSpotlight 17 APR 24\n\nHow young people benefit from Swiss apprenticeships\n\nSpotlight 17 APR 24\n\nI dive for fish in the longest freshwater lake in the world\n\nSpotlight 17 APR 24\n\nResearchers want a \u2018nutrition label\u2019 for academic-paper facts\n\nNature Index 17 APR 24\n\nStructure peer review to make it more robust\n\nWorld View 16 APR 24\n\nUS COVID-origins hearing puts scientific journals in the hot seat\n\nNews 16 APR 24\n\nDad always mows on summer Saturday mornings\n\nFutures 17 APR 24\n\nThree possible muses\n\nFutures 10 APR 24\n\nThese monkeys make no sense\n\nFutures 03 APR 24\n\nDeadly diseases and inflatable suits: how I found my niche in virology\nresearch\n\nSpotlight 17 APR 24\n\nHow young people benefit from Swiss apprenticeships\n\nSpotlight 17 APR 24\n\nI dive for fish in the longest freshwater lake in the world\n\nSpotlight 17 APR 24\n\n### Jobs\n\n  * #### Qiushi Chair Professor\n\nDistinguished scholars with notable achievements and extensive international\ninfluence.\n\nHangzhou, Zhejiang, China\n\nZhejiang University\n\n  * #### ZJU 100 Young Professor\n\nPromising young scholars who can independently establish and develop a\nresearch direction.\n\nHangzhou, Zhejiang, China\n\nZhejiang University\n\n  * #### Head of the Thrust of Robotics and Autonomous Systems\n\nReporting to the Dean of Systems Hub, the Head of ROAS is an executive\nassuming overall responsibility for the academic, student, human resources...\n\nGuangzhou, Guangdong, China\n\nThe Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)\n\n  * #### Head of Biology, Bio-island\n\nHead of Biology to lead the discovery biology group.\n\nGuangzhou, Guangdong, China\n\nBeiGene Ltd.\n\n  * #### Research Postdoctoral Fellow - MD (Cardiac Surgery)\n\nHouston, Texas (US)\n\nBaylor College of Medicine (BCM)\n\nDownload PDF\n\n## Related Articles\n\n  * Use these tips to take an amazing science photograph\n\n  * How I harnessed media engagement to supercharge my research career\n\n  * Digging in: last chance to save a native forest\n\n## Subjects\n\n  * Careers\n  * Publishing\n  * Arts\n\n## Sign up to Nature Briefing\n\nAn essential round-up of science news, opinion and analysis, delivered to your\ninbox every weekday.\n\nSign up for the Nature Briefing newsletter \u2014 what matters in science, free to\nyour inbox daily.\n\nGet the most important science stories of the day, free in your inbox.
