It had been posted\non social media by Jo\u017ee Kozjek who works as a forester there, and is committed\nto photograph and document what he sees as remarkable testimonies to the\ncultural heritage of his region and country.\n\nThis house and many others related are extraordinary pieces of design, moving\ntributes to human inventiveness as it is played out within (or around) a\ntraditional form.\n\nThese are of course words of \u2018now\u2019, written in admiration towards a process\nwhich was conducted with such fluency and ease that it could only be derived\nfrom embodied shared knowledge. We might now tend to call it \u2018tradition\u2019 which\nis a somewhat deadening word to pin onto something so alive, virtuosic and\nexuberant.\n\nBeing both related and totally foreign to my work on violins, it was\nfascinating for me to try to figure out how these angled joints might be\ndesigned and cut.\n\nThe reason for these few words and images is to share this fascination.\n\nOf the houses themselves I know little. They are known to date from the 18^th\nto the 19^th centuries. My guess is that as often seen in forest dwellings\n[still practised today in the \u2018carbets\u2019 of the French Guyanian rain forest], a\nclearing is cut, and the house is built from the timber felled. It seems to be\nspruce, Picea Abies. It would be interesting to submit some of the ring\npatterns for dendrochronological study, as it may confirm the age and also the\nprovenance of the timber.\n\nSo to these joints: a Baroque variation on a double dovetail? And why such\nvirtuosity?\n\nThe method for stacking, alternating the beams on either side of the corner is\nclear if one looks at the photograph above, but the joining method is elusive\nat first.\n\nThe photos below show the process I followed to try to understand the basic\nbuilding blocks.\n\nOnce I found what a likely shape was, I realised something amazing (and\nobvious once one sees it clearly!) that the pieces are of only one type, with\nthe under and upper faces of one given piece being mirror images of each\nother. Thus, for two pieces to fit together they need to be actually\nidentical!\n\nCutting is one thing: I found that I got a little better at it after a few\ntries. A gouge, a chisel and a saw can do it, there is one area near the\nshoulder of the tenon which cannot be sawn, so it needs a bit of digging with\na chisel, but otherwise it is doable.\n\nThat is cutting two surfaces and making them meet, on a small scale model.\n\nBuilding the actual house, this would be taking place using pieces of wood\nwhich (I guess) are likely to weigh somewhere between 100kg and 200kg each,\nwhere the joints need to be fitted simultaneously on the four corners around\nthe building. This is no mean feat, and would need to be underpinned by a\nrigorous marking strategy before any cutting is done, in order to minimise the\nneed to move pieces.\n\nI speculate that a single flat sheet of material (card, thin metal, thin wood\nperhaps, glue-sized paper?) could be used to mark all lines, designed in such\na way that convex and concave are marked using the same drawing, therefore\nthey have to fit. This is of course the general idea for marking dovetail\njoints.\n\nThis is the reason for the stencil cardboard template which I show (see\nphotos).\n\nHaving tried to put pressures on the assembled wooden pieces I made, I was\nstruck by two properties of this joint:\n\n# when a vertical compression is applied to it, the angled joint becomes more\nresistant to bending and becomes more brace-like and apt at resisting shear\nand tension.\n\n# if a load is applied which forces a distortion (bending) onto the 90 degree\nangle, there can be a bit of play to accommodate for it, and a small amount of\nmovement can happen without breakage.\n\nI think these two properties would be very useful in a timber building: one\nneeds to imagine a roof made to resist the weight of snow, and the constant\nmovements of wood which is an extremely hygroscopic material.\n\nMiraculously some of these houses are structurally intact after 200 years or\nmore.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nBelow: photos by Jo\u017ee Kozjek of that house, and of another one from the same\narea with many shared characteristics\n\nThis short blog article is the beginning of what I hope is \u2018work in progress\u2019:\n\nThere is thought of a version in Slovenian, and also of an exploration more in\ndepth of the context of these fascinating structures.\n\nI wish to thank Jo\u017ee Kozjek and Nina Katarina \u0160tular.\n\nThanks to Paul Mackilligin for the stimulating conversations which lead to\nthese investigations in wood!\n\n[ \u00a9 All rights reserved 2021 Bruno Guastalla + Jo\u017ee Kozjek ]\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### Related\n\nCategories diary, instrument making, music, PHOTOGRAPHY, pictures, writingTags\nSlovenia, Tuhinj Valley22 Comments\n\n## 22 thoughts on \u201cHOUSE IN THE TUHINJ VALLEY\u201d\n\n  1.

The joints are an astonishing combination of ingenious, complex,\nand beautiful. And I love the photos of your workings out, and so impressed by\nthe work you put in. What a challenge \u2013 and what a well met challenge . I\nthink you may have hit on an ideal way to fend off the lockdown blues!\nBrilliant.\n\nReply\n\n    1. BRUNO GUASTALLA says:\n\n5 February 2021 at 7:56 pm\n\nHi Keith! Yes this is fun, and it keeps giving: Jo\u017ee is in the process of\ngathering more pictures, and info on context and more . Thanks, B.\n\nReply\n\n      1. Keith Allen says:\n\n7 February 2021 at 8:46 am\n\nThanks for this Bruno \u2013 I look forward to the extra photos and detail. Just so\nremarkable to see how a combination of necessity and simple forward planning\ndrew out such a high level of sophistication.\n\n  3. Greg Steckler says:\n\n5 February 2021 at 4:45 pm\n\nThis is a fascinating subject. I\u2019m a log home designer and builder for 40+\nyears in Oregon, USA. These notches shrink tighter as they age it appears.\nNotice your model has a slight \u201cunderhang\u201d of the ends of the members but the\nphoto of the old timbers shows a slight overhang, yet the notch is very tight\ntowards the interior of the sturcture. Of course logs weigh a lot and\nconsderation of putting slightly more pressure on the joint as apposed to the\nlength of the log is important too. Great research! Please continue.\n\nReply\n\n    1. BRUNO GUASTALLA says:\n\n5 February 2021 at 7:53 pm\n\nGood to hear from you Greg! Thanks for your contribution!\n\nI think my model suffers from \u2018beginner\u2019s approximative cuts syndrome\u2019 !\n(although as a maker of violins I sould have known better, I was a bit timid\nin my relation to the scribed lines..).\n\nTo try to add to your points about overhang on the joint itself: 1/ The joints\nare such that a vertical load tightens them up (which is a smart move design\nwise!). 2/ Shrinkage over time: as a rule longitudinal shrinkage is\nnegligeable if compared to tangential and radial shrinkage. Therefore, I would\ntend to believe that the overhang one sees of the long grain on the photograph\nof the house is simply due to this.\n\nSo I have a suspicion that what they did was pretty exact with good fits\neverywhere, and that what we see now is a construction which has aged well\nover 200 years +. And, thinking of it, I expect you are completely right that\nthe corners were likely to have been given a tighter fit initially than the\nlength of the logs, so that, with the massive compression of the weight of the\nhouse, roof and all, the joints indeed tighten and the whole structure\ncoalesces.\n\nReply\n\n  4. Greg Steckler says:\n\n7 February 2021 at 4:53 pm\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re on the right track, Bruno. And work like this is not a \u201cone\noff\u201d. It is an evolution of thinking and building over lifetimes. Whether they\nused templetes or had \u2018templetes of the mind\u2019 (vast experience) is hard to\nknow but one thing is sure....these are masterpieces. I hope Joze is doing\nexhaustive research on this style of construction where ever it is found and\nwe can look forward to the who, when, how and why of these acncient styles of\nwood working. This is a b ig deal.\n\nReply\n\n  5. BRUNO GUASTALLA says:\n\n7 February 2021 at 5:45 pm\n\nGreat, Greg, I very much apppreciate your encouragement, and will let you know\npersonally when more comes out. I think you are right about templates too: it\nis a question of what to mark and where; it could simply be done with dividers\nand three notches on a set square (to mark the three cutting levels on each\nsurface top, mid, bottom), and the \u2018filling in\u2019 done by eye and feel. One\nthing is for sure: there is no room for error in this. In the violin making\nworld which I have inhabited for 45 years, there are surpringly few aspects of\nworking as naked as this, (except purfling inlays). Shapes are arrived at\n\u2018from above\u2019as it were, so even if one is always using the biggest tool\npossible at all times, one has time to see the shape emerging and the\nopportunity to make adjustments.\n\nReply\n\n  6. Magda Harsanyi says:\n\n14 March 2021 at 8:44 pm\n\nThe Japanese also do this. The are YouTube videos of them creating very\ncomplicated joints.\n\nReply\n\n    1. BRUNO GUASTALLA says:\n\n14 March 2021 at 9:16 pm\n\nDear Magda, Thank you for your comment. Japanese joinery is indeed amazing,\nextremely varied and rightly well known. It would be great if you could find\nvideos of Japanese joinery where the type of joints and processes somehow\nrelate to this particular way of doing things. Please do post them here!\n\nReply\n\n  7. Jim says:\n\n2 June 2023 at 2:25 pm\n\nThe photo that showed up on my FB feed is amazing. Truly amazing joinery, and\nat a level of complexity I have never seen in a log building. It is not only\nbeautiful. but obviously superior to any other log construction joinery. Would\nlove to know about the person that developed it. Thanks for sharing this gem.\n\nReply\n\n  8. brucemacevans says:\n\n3 June 2023 at 8:18 am\n\nBruno thank you so much for sharing this study. Was wonderful to see in on the\nFB feed today as Jim did. Enriching and inspiring work and so important to see\nthat this is authentic and historic, lasting work. I am glad to have seen this\ntoday.\n\nReply\n\n  9. Phil Sweet says:\n\n4 June 2023 at 11:56 am\n\nBruno, I first saw an image of this joinery two years ago and have been in\nsearch of a craftsperson local to the region it comes from. I\u2019m able and\nwilling to travel for the experience of learning it. If you or anyone else on\nthis thread have more information on learning itt on location I would\nappreciate the information.\n\nReply\n\n    1. BRUNO GUASTALLA says:\n\n4 June 2023 at 12:23 pm\n\nDear Phil, I think the best way would be to get in touch with Joze (see above)\nI haven\u2019t been in touch with him recently.. Do contact me either with the\ncontact link on this blog or via messenger, and I\u2019ll see what I can do. I\nhaven\u2019t been there myself. It is that region:\nhttps://www.google.com/maps/place/Tuhinjska+dolina/@46.2182639,14.75146,13.54z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x476548836299d5a5:0xeb795aa3d4588d8c!8m2!3d46.2230123!4d14.765082!16s%2Fm%2F05226lz!5m1!1e4?entry=ttu\n\nReply\n\n      1. BRUNO GUASTALLA says:\n\n4 June 2023 at 12:59 pm\n\nI don\u2019t believe that this is a tradition which has carried on and is still\nalive. These are old buildings. If you are in a position to help revive that\ntradition, good on you! See post above.\n\n    2. Greg Steckler says:\n\n4 June 2023 at 9:01 pm\n\nPhil, although I can\u2019t join you as I\u2019m on the other side of the world, I too\nam very interested in this \u201cdiscovery\u201d. I may be able to stir up some interest\nin several wood working institutions and perhaps some funding?\n\nReply\n\n      1. BRUNO GUASTALLA says:\n\n17 June 2023 at 8:27 pm\n\n(apologies for the delay in approving comments.. I thought I had already done\nit.. By the way, I\u2019ll make the trip gladly if there is mileage in this\nidea...)\n\n  10. Gohar Bars says:\n\n4 June 2023 at 4:26 pm\n\nHi Bruno, can you please add your research to our map-based historical\nplatform? https://metaport.ai Thank you\n\nReply\n\n  11. Skip Yates says:\n\n8 June 2023 at 5:41 pm\n\nNo doubt...very beautiful & functional...scribing the top to the lower pre cut\nnotch. One would think you would have to do the other end as well. Try to keep\nlevel as you move upward.I don\u2019t think you could get those notches perfect the\nfirst time ? Might have to scribe multiple times as well?? Not taking any\nthing away from the wizardary here But doing this with hand hewn 18c oak would\nbe quite the challenge. I am game! This way of notching is a game changer.\n\nReply\n\n  12. Greg Steckler says:\n\n16 June 2023 at 4:10 pm\n\nSo does this style have a name? Is it \u201cBaroque variation on a double\ndovetail\u201d?\n\nReply\n\n    1. BRUNO GUASTALLA says:\n\n17 June 2023 at 8:15 pm\n\nI called it that, simply out of not knowing what to call it...!!\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a comment Cancel reply\n\n## RECENT POSTS\n\n  * IMAGERIES 2+2\n  * FIVE IMPROVISATIONS ON PRINTS BY PAULA REGO\n  * CONCERT AZUT + UUSIKUU 28-10-23 -7:30PM\n  * POSTCARDS FROM THE HOO PENINSULA II\n  * POSTCARDS FROM THE HOO PENINSULA I\n  * PHOTO ARGENTIQUE (RETOUR VERS)\n  * AT A SPRYNGE WEL\n  * DAWN AT HOGACRE COMMON 9 APRIL 2023\n  * a letter for Louise\n  * SLOW JUMPS\n  * BRIDGE GARDEN \u2013 more than one\n  * VESSELS OF AIR\n  * LIMINAL (SHORT VIDEO)\n  * COTHILL WOOD OXFORDSHIRE\n  * MIRROR TROPE\n  * AURIC STRING QUARTET CONCERT IN OXFORD\n  * SPOKE (A SHORT FILM)\n  * GLASS MAN\n  * 2021 PHOTOS: PRINTS FOR SALE\n  * on one side\n\nJanuary 2021M| T| W| T| F| S| S  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n1| 2| 3  \n4| 5| 6| 7| 8| 9| 10  \n11| 12| 13| 14| 15| 16| 17  \n18| 19| 20| 21| 22| 23| 24  \n25| 26| 27| 28| 29| 30| 31  \n  \nBlog at WordPress.com.\n\n  * Comment\n  * Reblog\n  * Subscribe Subscribed\n\n    * Bruno Guastalla\n    * Already have a WordPress.com account?
