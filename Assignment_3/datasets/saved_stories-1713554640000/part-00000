It's fast. And it's fun!\n\nTech Conferences: Does Your Employer Pay?\n\nDoes your employer pay for you to attend tech conferences?\n\nYes, registration and travel are comped.\n\nYes, just registration but not travel expenses.\n\nYes, travel expenses but not registration.\n\nOnly virtual conferences.\n\nNo reimbursement.\n\nWe'd love to hear what you think.\n\nSEATTLE \u2014 The InfoWorld story by Matt Asay about OpenTofu and a cease and\ndesist letter from HashiCorp took center stage Tuesday morning at Open Source\nSummit North America.\n\nOn April 3, InfoWorld published a post by Asay, MongoDB\u2019s vice president of\ndeveloper relations, in which he claimed OpenTofu, the group that forked\nTerraform, the widely used Infrastructure as Code product, \u201clifted Terraform\ncode related to a new removed block feature first implemented in Terraform\nV1.7, which was released under the Business Software License (BUSL) a few\nmonths after the OpenTofu fork was created.\u201d\n\nHashicorp runs the Terraform project. The company changed Terraform\u2019s license\nfrom the Mozilla Open Source Public License about seven months ago. What a\nride it has been ever since.\n\nSo, Asay writes this post, saying, \u201cIt looks a lot like a violation of\nHashiCorp\u2019s intellectual property.\u201d\n\nThe OpenTofu project has denied HashiCorp\u2019s allegations of code theft.\n\nWhat makes Asay\u2019s post odd, in this case, is how it all looks. His employer,\nMongoDB, turned to a closed-source license in 2018. And here\u2019s Asay writing\nthis post that simultaneously publishes at about the same time when OpenTofu\ngets its cease and desist letter from Hashicorp.\n\n\u201cNot only did that happen publicly, but simultaneously the OpenTofu\nmaintainers got a cease and desist letter from a Silicon Valley law firm\ntelling them to take that code out,\u201d said Jim Zemlin, executive director of\nThe Linux Foundation, in the opening keynote at the Open Source Summit.\n\nTRENDING STORIES\n\n  1. OpenTofu Project Denies HashiCorp's Allegations of Code Theft\n  2. OpenTofu vs. HashiCorp Takes Center Stage at Open Source Summit\n  3. How Do Open Source Licenses Work? The Ultimate Guide\n  4. What\u2019s Next for Companies Built on Open Source?\n  5. The Open Source Market\u2019s in Flux. How Can IT Managers Cope?\n\n## Investigating \u2018Code Theft\u2019 Allegations\n\nI so agree with Runtime\u2019s Tom Krazit analysis of the Asay episode:\n\nThat seemed to be enough for Infoworld, which inserted an editor\u2019s note at the\ntop of Asay\u2019s piece saying, \u201cbased on these documents, it appears that the\nOpenTofu community did not misappropriate HashiCorp\u2019s intellectual property\u201d\n(emphasis theirs) but otherwise left the headline and copy of the article\nintact.\n\n(Why a venerable enterprise tech publication continues to give a vendor\nmarketing executive the space to write basically anything he wants, especially\nabout a subject where he has an enormous conflict of interest given the\nsimilarities between MongoDB and HashiCorp\u2019s open source licensing strategies,\nremains inexplicable.)\n\nAs for OpenTofu? Zemlin said the project leaders analyzed and refuted every\nfacet of the Hashicorp allegation.\n\n\u201cWe have tools that allow us to process tens of thousands of contribution\nagreements in an automated and accurate way,\u201d Zemlin said. We take this stuff\nseriously, and the OpenTofu project fortunately does, too.\n\n\u201cWhen they heard these accusations, they immediately went and did a source\ncode origination analysis. They knew where all the code was, how it came in,\nand what license it was under. And it turns out that this analysis refuted\nevery single aspect of HashiCorp\u2019s allegation.\u201d\n\nWhat does this mean? We\u2019re looking at a new era \u2014 more closed-source licensing\nand forks, followed by more lawyers and more developers getting caught in the\nmiddle.\n\nAlex Williams is founder and publisher of The New Stack.
