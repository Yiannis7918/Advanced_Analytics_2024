His video\nfeed shows he\u2019s white, with short hair, likely a few years younger than her,\nand is sitting in front of his camera wearing a plaid shirt.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking different with that beard and stuff gone,\u201d the woman says in\nan American accent as the conversation gets going. The man doesn\u2019t miss a\nbeat. \u201cI told you I was going to shave my beard so I will look good.\u201d\n\nExcept, he isn\u2019t who he claims to be. His videofeed is a lie. And\u2014beard or\nnot\u2014the face the woman can see over the video call is not his: It\u2019s a\ndeepfake.\n\nIn reality, the man is a scammer using face-swapping technology to totally\nchange his appearance in real time. In a video of the call\u2014filmed by the\nscammer\u2019s accomplice likely thousands of miles away from the woman\u2014his real\nface can be seen on this laptop alongside the fake persona as he speaks to his\nvictim.\n\nThis self-shot video is one of scores posted online by scammers known as Yahoo\nBoys, a loose collective of con artists, often based in Nigeria. The video\nreveals how they are using deepfakes and face-swapping to ensnare victims in\nromance scams, building trust with victims using fake identities, before\ntricking them into parting with thousands of dollars. More than $650 million\nwas lost to romance fraud last year, the FBI says.\n\nA Yahoo Boy scammer uses multiple phones and face-swapping software against a\nvictim. It\u2019s one of two techniques the group uses for real-time calls.\n\nThe Yahoo Boys have been experimenting with deepfake video clips for around\ntwo years and shifted to more real-time deepfake video calls over the last\nyear, says David Maimon, a professor at Georgia State University and the head\nof fraud insights at identity verification firm SentiLink. Maimon has\nmonitored the Yahoo Boys on Telegram for more than four years and shared\ndozens of videos with WIRED revealing how the scammers are using deepfakes.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nNo, Dubai\u2019s Floods Weren\u2019t Caused by Cloud Seeding\n\nAmit Katwala\n\n  * Security\n\nHackers Linked to Russia\u2019s Military Claim Credit for Sabotaging US Water\nUtilities\n\nAndy Greenberg\n\n  * Business\n\nGoogle Workers Detained by Police for Protesting Cloud Contract With Israel\n\nCaroline Haskins\n\n  * Business\n\nGoogle Workers Protest Cloud Contract With Israel's Government\n\nCaroline Haskins\n\nA WIRED review of the videos and three associated Yahoo Boy Telegram channels\nshows how the con artists\u2019 techniques have evolved as deepfake applications\nand artificial intelligence have improved. It is one of the first times the\nspecific tactics and outlandish techniques of scammers using deepfake video\ncalls has been documented in this detail.\n\nThe videos show Yahoo Boys using the technology on setups involving both\nlaptops and phones. In multiple videos, the scammers often brazenly show their\nown faces, as well as those of the victims they are scamming. \u201cI don't think\nthey're doing this because they\u2019re stupid,\u201d Maimon says. \u201cI think that they\nsimply don\u2019t care, and they\u2019re not afraid of the repercussions.\u201d\n\nThe Yahoo Boys are experienced scammers\u2014and they openly brag about it. Photos\nand videos of their conning and recruitment can be found all across social\nmedia, from Facebook to TikTok. However, the cybercriminals, who have links\nback to Nigerian prince email scams, are arguably their most open on Telegram.\n\nIn groups containing thousands of members, Yahoo Boys organize and advertise\ntheir individual skills for a smorgasbord of scams. They\u2019re skilled social\nmanipulators, who can have long-lasting impacts on their victims. Business\nemail compromise, crypto scams, and impersonation scams are all touted in\nhundreds of posts per day. Members claim to be selling photo and video editing\nskills and entire albums of explicit photographs that can be used to build a\nconvincing persona. Fake IDs and legitimate-looking social media profiles are\nfor sale. Scam \u201cscripts\u201d are free to download.\n\n\u201cThe Yahoo Boys have elements of organized crime and disorganized crime,\u201d says\nPaul Raffile, an intelligence analyst at the Network Contagion Research\nInstitute, who has investigated Yahoo Boys sextorting teenagers and driving\nthem towards suicide. \u201cThey don't have a leader, they don\u2019t have a governance\nstructure.\u201d Rather, Raffile says, they organize in clusters and share advice\nand tips online. Telegram did not respond to WIRED\u2019s request for comment about\nYahoo Boys\u2019 channels, but the three channels no longer appear to be\naccessible.\n\nThe digital con artists started using deepfakes as part of their romance scams\naround May 2022, says Maimon. \u201cWhat folks were doing was just posting videos\nof themselves, changing their appearance, and then sending them to the\nvictim\u2014trying to lure them to talk to them,\u201d he says. Since then, they\u2019ve\nmoved on.\n\nTo create their videos, the Yahoo Boys are using a handful of different\nsoftware and apps. WIRED is not naming the specific software, to limit\npeople\u2019s ability to copy the attacks. However, the tools they are using are\noften advertised for entertainment purposes, such as allowing people to swap\ntheir faces with celebrities or influencers.\n\nThe Yahoo Boys\u2019 live deepfake calls run in two different ways. In the first,\nshown above, the scammers use a setup of two phones and a face-swapping app.\nThe scammer holds the phone they are calling their victim with\u2014they\u2019re mostly\nseen using Zoom, Maimon says, but it can work on any platform\u2014and uses its\nrear camera to record the screen of a second phone. This second phone has its\ncamera pointing at the scammer\u2019s face and is running a face-swapping app. They\noften place the two phones on stands to ensure they don\u2019t move and use ring\nlights to improve conditions for a real-time face-swap, the videos show.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nNo, Dubai\u2019s Floods Weren\u2019t Caused by Cloud Seeding\n\nAmit Katwala\n\n  * Security\n\nHackers Linked to Russia\u2019s Military Claim Credit for Sabotaging US Water\nUtilities\n\nAndy Greenberg\n\n  * Business\n\nGoogle Workers Detained by Police for Protesting Cloud Contract With Israel\n\nCaroline Haskins\n\n  * Business\n\nGoogle Workers Protest Cloud Contract With Israel's Government\n\nCaroline Haskins\n\nThe second common tactic\u2014shown below\u2014uses a laptop instead of a phone. (WIRED\nhas blurred real faces in both videos.) Here, the scammer uses a webcam to\ncapture their face and software running on the laptop changes their\nappearance. Videos of the setup show scammers are able to see their own face\nalongside the altered deepfake, with just the manipulated image being\ndisplayed over the live video call.\n\nMaimon says he and his teams have tracked down some of the victims, both in\ndeepfake videos and photo albums being sold by Yahoo Boys, and have tried to\ncontact them. WIRED was not able to determine the real identities of victims\nor scammers, and it is not clear how many times deepfakes have been used.\nStill, the videos appearing to feature victims reveal how the scammers build\nrapport with their targets.\n\nVideos show scammers telling people they \u201clove\u201d them and frequently\ncomplimenting their appearance. In one video, a scammer says they want to\ntravel to Canada to meet their target, and when they do, they will pay them\n\u201cinstantly,\u201d suggesting the target has sent them money that the scammer has\nfalsely promised to pay back. Other videos contain deeply personal\ninformation, showing the levels of trust that scammers can create with the\npeople they target. \u201cSome victims, they talk about their eating disorders,\nthey talk about their depression,\u201d Maimon says.\n\nThe videos are likely only a snapshot of the Yahoo Boys\u2019 romance-scamming\nactivity, and many of the videos they self-publish are partly intended to show\noff their capabilities to allow others to \u201cbuy\u201d the approach. Raffile says\nthat, as he investigated the groups for sextortion, he noticed most face-\nswapping was being used for romance scams. However, there were also instances\nwhere Yahoo Boys claimed to use deepfake \u201cnude\u201d generators on photographs.\n\nThe scammers can run face-swapping software on laptops. It mimics their facial\nexpressions and mouth movements.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nNo, Dubai\u2019s Floods Weren\u2019t Caused by Cloud Seeding\n\nAmit Katwala\n\n  * Security\n\nHackers Linked to Russia\u2019s Military Claim Credit for Sabotaging US Water\nUtilities\n\nAndy Greenberg\n\n  * Business\n\nGoogle Workers Detained by Police for Protesting Cloud Contract With Israel\n\nCaroline Haskins\n\n  * Business\n\nGoogle Workers Protest Cloud Contract With Israel's Government\n\nCaroline Haskins\n\nArtificial intelligence will supercharge scams. While deepfake videos have\nbeen around for more than half a decade\u2014mostly used for nonconsensual\npornography\u2014they\u2019re often glitchy and easy to spot. Lips don\u2019t sync up as\npeople talk, and errors are relatively trivial to detect. However, the\ntechnology is quickly improving and becoming easier for anyone to use.\n\nSome of the Yahoo Boy videos are unbelievable, obvious fakes, while others\nappear plausible. When they\u2019re viewed live, on a mobile phone, with unstable\nconnections, any obvious flaws may be masked\u2014especially if a scammer has spent\nmonths social-engineering their victim.\n\nRachel Tobac, the cofounder and CEO of SocialProof security, who along with\ncompany CTO Evan Tobac reviewed a selection of Yahoo Boy videos for WIRED,\nsays she has generally seen some face swapping being used in romance scams\nover the past 12 months. \u201cThey were not super convincing last year, when I\nchecked them out. This year, a lot has changed,\u201d Rachel Tobac says.\n\u201cEspecially the ones where they\u2019re able to change the pitch of their voice and\nthe look of their face\u2014sometimes changing skin tone, hair, eye color,\neverything\u2019s matched. It\u2019s pretty wild.\u201d\n\nThe Yahoo Boys appear to often use existing personas and faces built into the\napps. The scammers largely talk using their own voices, although in a couple\nof videos this may have also been altered. In many of the videos seen by\nWIRED, the onscreen characters can turn their heads but not move their entire\nbodies. Their lips and facial expressions move with those made by the face of\nthe scammer. The capabilities of these tools will only improve over time.\n\nAndrew Newell, the chief scientific officer at identity verification company\niProov, says he has seen a \u201cmassive change\u201d in the number of face-swapping\nsystems being used in the last year, tracking more than 100 different tools.\nOnly a fraction of these tools allow for real-time face-swapping, he says. \u201cWe\nhave seen quite big advances in terms of how good these live tools are.\u201d\n\nWhile the Yahoo Boys may not develop their own software or be technically\nsophisticated, Maimon says, they are versatile. They\u2019ll run multiple scams at\nonce, speak with dozens of victims at a time, and different individuals will\nhave the skills needed to complete an entire scam. \u201cThere's a constant\nevolution,\u201d Maimon says.\n\nRonnie Tokazowski, the chief fraud fighter at Intelligence for Good, which\nworks with cybercrime victims, says because the Yahoo Boys have used deepfakes\nfor romance scams, they\u2019ll pivot to using the technology for their other\nscams. \u201cThis is kind of an early warning where it's like: \u2018OK, they\u2019re really\ngood at doing these things. Now, what\u2019s the next thing they're going to do?\u2019\u201d\n\n## You Might Also Like ...\n\n  * In your inbox: The best and weirdest stories from WIRED\u2019s archive\n\n  * Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s island visitors exposed by data broker\n\n  * 8 Google employees invented modern AI.
