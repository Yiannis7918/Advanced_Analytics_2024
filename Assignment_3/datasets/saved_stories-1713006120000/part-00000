We'll be sharing these stories over the next several weeks.\n\nSam and John Fetters, 19, are identical twins at opposite ends of the autism\nspectrum.\n\nSam is a sophomore at Amherst College who plans to double major in history and\npolitical science. In his free time, he runs marathons.\n\nJohn attends a special school, struggles to form sentences, and likes to watch\nTeletubbies and Sesame Street.\n\nTwo brothers. Same genes. Different flavors of autism.\n\nTo scientists, twins like Sam and John pose an important question: How can a\ndisorder that is known to be highly genetic look so different in siblings who\nshare the same genome?\n\n### The Science of Siblings\n\n\"That is one of the greatest mysteries right now in research on autism,\" says\nDr. Stephanie Morris, a pediatric neurologist at the Kennedy Krieger Institute\nin Baltimore.\n\nSolving that mystery could help explain autism's odd mix of nature and\nnurture, Morris says. It also might help \"modify the trajectory\" of autistic\nchildren experiencing speech and language delays, or difficulty with social\ncommunication.\n\n### Identical twins on separate paths\n\nSam and John are spending the weekend with their mom, Kim Leaird, at the\nfamily's apartment in West Tisbury, a small town on Martha's Vineyard.\n\nThe twins are crowded together on a couch. Even seated, they look tall.\nStanding, Sam is 6 feet, 5 inches, his brother just an inch shorter.\n\nJohn lets Sam do most of the talking. He frequently touches his brother, who\nsometimes takes his hand.\n\nJohn has \"a truly tremendous amount of empathy,\" Sam says. \"He's able to be\nvery supportive.\"\n\nWhen Sam and his mother were at odds, John would comfort him. And when Sam ran\ntrack and cross country in high school meets, he'd see his brother at the\nfinish line, \"jumping up and down because he was so happy.\"\n\nWhen John speaks, it's often about Sesame Street characters, including his\nfavorite: Cookie Monster.\n\nEarly in life, Sam (left) and John were much more similar than they may seem\ntoday. \"They both did not wave, they didn't respond to their name, they both\nhad a lot of repetitive movements,\" says their mother, Kim Leaird. Jodi Hilton\nfor NPR hide caption\n\ntoggle caption\n\nJodi Hilton for NPR\n\nEarly in life, Sam (left) and John were much more similar than they may seem\ntoday. \"They both did not wave, they didn't respond to their name, they both\nhad a lot of repetitive movements,\" says their mother, Kim Leaird.\n\nJodi Hilton for NPR\n\nWhy that particular Muppet?\n\n\"He likes cookies!\" John says.\n\nEarly in life, Sam and John were much more similar than they may seem today,\nLeaird says.\n\n\"They both did not wave, they didn't respond to their name, they both had a\nlot of repetitive movements,\" she says.\n\nAt age 2, neither was speaking. So Leaird enrolled them in an early\nintervention preschool.\n\n### Shots - Health News\n\n### At the heart of this cozy coffee shop lies a big sister's love for her\nlittle brother\n\nIt worked for Sam.\n\n\"He started talking and has never stopped,\" Leaird says. \"It was only then we\nwere like, 'Well, what's going on with John?\"\n\nShe moved John to a more intensive program. Even so, he didn't begin using\nwords until he was 4.\n\n\"The earliest twin studies really helped to debunk this theory that autism was\ncaused by parenting,\" says Dr. Stephanie Morris, a pediatric neurologist at\nthe Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore.

So Sam and John were evaluated\nat Kennedy Krieger Institute, which is known for treating children with\ndevelopmental disabilities.\n\nStudies like the one involving Sam and John have played a critical role in\nunderstanding autism since the 1970s.\n\n\"The earliest twin studies really helped to debunk this theory that autism was\ncaused by parenting,\" Morris says. Under this theory, moms took the brunt of\nthe blame, supposedly for being \"cold and distant and detached from their\nchild.\"\n\nThose studies showed that autism was largely a product of genetics, not\nparenting.\n\n### Science\n\n### Have a story about your sibling? Share it with us!\n\nIn 2019, a study of 366 pairs of identical twins changed the field again.\n\nThe study confirmed earlier research showing that if one twin had autism,\nthere was a 90% chance the other would too.\n\n\"However, the level, or the severity in which the twins were manifesting the\ndiagnosis, was incredibly different,\" Morris says.\n\nThe finding suggests that autism symptoms can be greatly influenced by events\nthat happen after conception.\n\nWe are identical twins in almost every other way \u2014 laugh in the same way, cry\nin the same way, see the day in the same way, love the same way.\n\nSam Fetters\n\nThese events could include mutations in dividing fetal cells, or something\nthat causes certain genes to be switched on or off.\n\nAnother possibility, Morris says, is that the severity of symptoms is affected\nby different experiences during pregnancy and in the first few months of life.\n\n\"There's something in very very early development that might be unique to one\nof the twins and not the other,\" she says. \"That could be something as simple\nas an infection.\"\n\n### A hole in the heart\n\nBoth John and Sam were born with anatomical anomalies that required surgery.\n\nSam had a hernia that needed repair, but it was surgery that could wait until\nhe was 5. John had a hole in his heart that was affecting his growth and had\nto be fixed when he was still an infant.\n\nSam's surgery went smoothly. But John developed an infection in the incision\nsurgeons had made in his chest.\n\nThe infection was from drug-resistant staph bacteria. So John went back to the\nhospital and spent a month on powerful antibiotics pumped directly into a vein\nnear his heart.\n\nThere's no way to know whether that experience changed the course of John's\nautism.\n\n### Life Kit\n\n### How to have a 'grown up' relationship with a sibling\n\n\"It's really only later that I thought, well, maybe it was the staph infection\nand John's environment when he was so little,\" Leaird says.\n\nRegardless of what causes twins to end up at different places on the autism\nspectrum, these siblings seem to have a special relationship, Morris says.\n\nWhen the boys spent a year in the same school, Sam did fine, but John\nstruggled and had some noisy meltdowns. Jodi Hilton for NPR hide caption\n\ntoggle caption\n\nJodi Hilton for NPR\n\nWhen the boys spent a year in the same school, Sam did fine, but John\nstruggled and had some noisy meltdowns.\n\nJodi Hilton for NPR\n\n\"I think there's an understanding that 'My twin isn't quite as capable of\ncommunicating in the way that they need to, so I'll help them with that,'\" she\nsays.\n\nThat description fits Sam and John.\n\nWhen asked to name his favorite episode of Sesame Street, John blurts out a\nseries of words: \"Abby makes the seasons change.\" Sam understands immediately\nand quickly steps in to explain.\n\n\"There's an episode with Abby Cadabby, Rosita and Zoe, where they dance around\nwith the seasons changing,\" Sam says. \"I think that's the one he's referring\nto.\"\n\n### His brother's keeper\n\nSam has always looked out for his brother, Leaird says.\n\nWhen the boys spent a year in the same school, she says, Sam did fine, but\nJohn struggled and had some noisy meltdowns.\n\n\"Sam would hear him from his classroom, and he would just flee,\" Leaird says.\n\"He would get up and run to his brother to help him and to translate for him.\"\n\nNow that Sam is off at college, he worries about his brother, whose limited\nspeech and flapping arms can make him the target of insults and ridicule.\n\n\"One of the ways you avoid that is trying to present [as] more neurotypical,\"\nSam says. \"I can do that. My brother can't.\"\n\nSam has always looked out for his brother. But now that he has moved away for\ncollege, he worries about John. Jodi Hilton for NPR hide caption\n\ntoggle caption\n\nJodi Hilton for NPR\n\nSam has always looked out for his brother. But now that he has moved away for\ncollege, he worries about John.\n\nJodi Hilton for NPR\n\nActually being neurotypical isn't something Sam wants for his brother or\nhimself.\n\n\"I think I approach the world in interesting ways,\" Sam says, noting that\nautism has contributed to his passion for history and running.\n\nJohn's autism is part of the \"amazing and creative world in his head,\" Sam\nsays, a world that includes Teletubbies and Muppets, as well as people and\nplaces.\n\nEven so, Sam wishes his brother could use words the way he does.\n\n\"We are identical twins in almost every other way \u2014 laugh in the same way, cry\nin the same way, see the day in the same way, love the same way,\" Sam says.\n\"He should absolutely have that ability to speak. He should have that. And him\nnot having that is so unfair.\"\n\nSo for now, Sam plans to keep using his own words to help say what his brother\ncan't.\n\nTwin brothers Sam and John take a walk outside their family home on Martha's\nVineyard.
