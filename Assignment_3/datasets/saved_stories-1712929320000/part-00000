Or follow us on\nGoogle News!\n\nThe Intertubes lit up today with news of a new, 190% efficient solar cell that\ncould finally send fossil fuels packing once and for all. The research is\nstill in the proof-of-concept stage, but other solar cells that shoot past the\n100% mark are already in development, so anything is possible. However, if\nyou\u2019re thinking this blows the Shockley-Queisser theoretical limit to bits,\nwell, guess again.\n\n### Solar Cells Can Shoot Past 100% Efficiency, Depending On What That Means\n\nThe Shockley-Queisser limit refers to the ability of solar cells to convert\nsunlight to electricity. The theory emerged in the 1960s to describe the upper\nlimit of basic silicon photovoltaic technology. The initial limit was\ndetermined to be 30%, later revised upward to 33.7%.\n\nThat leaves quite a bit of sunlight hanging around without a purpose, but more\ncomplex solar cells can easily surpass 33.7%. For example, in 2022 researchers\nat the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems in Germany achieved 47.6%\nfor a solar cell that combines a layer of gallium indium phosphide and\naluminum gallium arsenide, together with another layer of gallium indium\narsenide phosphide and gallium indium arsenide.\n\nPhotovoltaic technology can also be tweaked to achieve higher efficiencies by\nharvesting heat as well as light, and that describes the goings-on over at the\nlaboratory of Lehigh University physics professor Chinedu Ekuma in\nPennsylvania.\n\nEkuma\u2019s team developed the proof of concept for a new solar cell that captures\nenergy from reflected light and heat, as well a direct sunlight, to get to the\n190% level for external quantum efficiency, which is not the same thing as\nconversion efficiency.\n\n\u201cIn traditional solar cells, the maximum EQE [external quantum efficiency] is\n100%, representing the generation and collection of one electron for each\nphoton absorbed from sunlight. However, some advanced materials and\nconfigurations developed over the past several years have demonstrated the\ncapability of generating and collecting more than one electron from high-\nenergy photons, representing an EQE of over 100%,\u201d Lehigh University explained\nin a press statement.\n\n### What Is External Quantum Efficiency?\n\nFor an explanation of quantum efficiency, let\u2019s turn to the online course\noffered by MIT Professor Tonio Buonassisi back in 2011.\n\n\u201c\u2018Quantum efficiency (QE)\u2018 is defined as the number of electrons out per\nincident photon,\u201d Buonassisi explains.\n\n\u201cNote that QE is simply a census: it does not take into consideration the\nenergy of the electron or photon. QE is generally reported as a function of\nwavelength. QE is a useful troubleshooting tool to identify why a device is\nunderperforming,\u201d Buonassisi adds.\n\n\u201cQE values can be quite high (between 60 and 99% for certain wavelengths), and\nthus can be used by devious individuals to misrepresent the conversion\nefficiency of their solar cell device,\u201d he concludes.\n\nDevious individuals! That certainly does not include the media office at\nLehigh. They are very careful to explain that the new proof of concept\ninvolves quantum efficiency, not conversion efficiency. It\u2019s right there in\nthe headline, \u201cNew quantum material promises over 190% quantum efficiency in\nsolar cells.\u201d\n\n### Why Solar Cells With 190% Quantum Efficiency Matter\n\nTurning to the trade organization Solar Manufacturing, we also learn that\nexternal quantum efficiency is not the same as internal quantum efficiency.\n\n\u201cThere are two types of quantum efficiency: internal and external,\u201d they\nexplain. \u201cThe external quantum efficiency (EQE) includes the reflection losses\nof the solar cell. The internal quantum efficiency (IQE) is corrected for the\noptical losses due to reflection at the front of the solar cell.\n\nIn a conventional solar cell, the EQE can reach up to 100%, meaning that each\nincoming photon produces one electron. The Lehigh media team points out that\nsurpassing the 100% limit is not uncommon in today\u2019s world of atomic-level\ntailoring and two-dimensional advanced materials.\n\nThe leap to 190% is something else again. To get there, Ekum and his team took\na two-dimensional compound of germanium selenide and tin sulfide and stuffed\nit with atoms of zerovalent copper, referring to a nanoscale form of copper\ncommonly used in environmental remediation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a promising candidate for the development of next-generation, high-\nefficient solar cells, which will play a crucial role in addressing global\nenergy needs,\u201d Ekuma explains. \u201cIts rapid response and enhanced efficiency\nstrongly indicate the potential of Cu-intercalated GeSe/SnS as a quantum\nmaterial for use in advanced photovoltaic applications, offering an avenue for\nefficiency improvements in solar energy conversion.\u201d\n\nChip in a few dollars a month to help support independent cleantech coverage\nthat helps to accelerate the cleantech revolution!\n\n### From Promising Candidates To The Solar Cells Of The Future\n\nAs Professor Ekuma makes clear, the new quantum material is a material, not a\nfull-fledged solar cell. That will be the next step in the R&D process. In the\nmeantime, you can get all the details about the new material from the journal\nScience Advances under the title, \u201cChemically tuned intermediate band states\nin atomically thin CuxGeSe/SnS quantum material for photovoltaic\napplications.\u201d\n\nTin sulfide is commonly used in photovoltaic applications, so it\u2019s no surprise\nto see it pop up in the new research. The tin angle has also come up in\nrelation to perovskite solar technology, a new class of photovoltaic materials\nbased on the structure of the naturally occurring mineral perovskite.\n\nAs for Lehigh University, the school does not grab the media spotlight as\noften as the other top schools in the US. However, the institution is an\nimportant energy research facility and it crosses the CleanTechnica radar on a\nfairly regular basis.\n\nThe latest addition to the school\u2019s research resources is a new solar thermal\nconcentrator installed at the Mountaintop campus.\n\n\u201cThe new equipment is the result of a collaboration involving Lehigh\u2019s Energy\nResearch Center (ERC; Dr. Romero is the director), the Department of\nMechanical Engineering and Mechanics (MEM), and industry partner Solarflux\nEnergy Technologies,\u201d Lehigh explains.\n\nSolarflux is also a familiar face on CleanTechnica, so stay tuned for more on\nthe Mountaintop installation. As described by Lehigh, the company\u2019s parabolic\ntrough thermal concentrating technology is paired with a high tech solar\ntracking system to align with the sun for maximum efficiency throughout the\nday.\n\nThe school lists solar thermal energy, thermal energy storage, and\nthermochemical solar water splitting among the research projects already\nplanned for the new Solarflux system, so stay tuned for more on that.\n\nFollow me @tinamcasey on Bluesky, Threads, Post, and LinkedIn.\n\nPhoto (cropped): Proof of concept for a new photovoltaic material could lead\nto next-generation solar cells (courtesy of US Department of Energy).\n\nHave a tip for CleanTechnica?
