That\u2019s entrepreneur Kameale\nTerry, co-founder of ChargerHelp, a Los Angeles startup.\n\nShe\u2019s tackling a modern problem \u2014 the sorry state of electric vehicle public\ncharging stations \u2014 while training an often-overlooked workforce for jobs in a\ngrowing sector of the economy.\n\nAggressive and impactful reporting on climate change, the environment, health\nand science.\n\nExplore our new section\n\nBillions of dollars are flowing into building out a national EV charging\nnetwork, with billions more in California. Outside of Tesla\u2019s supercharging\nnetwork, however, the equipment deployed by several charging companies has\nproven unreliable, with more than 20% of chargers overall out of order at a\ngiven time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWithout reliable public chargers, persuading people to buy EVs to fight\nclimate change and cut pollution will be tougher.\n\nCharger companies say they\u2019re working hard to fix the reliability problem,\nboosting their own repair and maintenance capabilities, doing more training,\nand turning to third-party companies like ChargerHelp.\n\nThe charger sector is overflowing with young companies hoping to score in a\nfast-growing market. ChargerHelp, with $21 million in venture capital funding,\nhas developed software programs for charger maintenance and repair. Unlike\nmany competitors, the company also trains workers for network operations and\nfield repair, with a focus on people and communities long overlooked during\nearlier periods of economic and technological change.\n\nChargerHelp \u201cis creating great jobs, with an orientation on general and racial\ndiversity,\u201d said David Epstein, chief executive at Unreasonable Group, which\nlinks startup companies with investors. But ChargerHelp isn\u2019t just a do-gooder\norganization, he said. \u201cThey have a great business model from a cash flow\nperspective.\u201d\n\nLike many entrepreneurs in what\u2019s come to be called \u201ccleantech,\u201d the\nopportunities came somewhat as a surprise. Terry\u2019s story counts as an example\nof good luck favoring the prepared mind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClimate & Environment\n\n### Can California pull off the epic transition to EVs? Read our coverage here\n\nCalifornia has ambitious climate goals, including a pledge to ban the sale of\nnew gasoline- and diesel-powered cars and light trucks by 2035.\n\nMarch 29, 2024\n\nShe grew up in South L.A. Her large family put strong weight on commitment and\nhard work. It paid off. She\u2019s risen quickly in any organization she\u2019s become\npart of. Motivated by the idea of financial success, she took a job with a\nbank near Philadelphia. Starting out as a part-time teller and ending up as a\nbusiness-bank manager.\n\nShe loved Philly. \u201cOne of the greatest things is that there are so many black\npeople,\u201d she said on the Founders Unfound podcast not long after ChargerHelp\nwas founded in 2019. She visited her cousin Ray who worked in Washington,\nD.C., on Capitol Hill. \u201cEverybody was like a geek, and it was wild to see\nblack wealth concentrated in such a way,\u201d she said. It was inspiring.\n\nHer mother\u2019s recurring cancer brought her back to L.A. in 2016. Saving her\nenergy for caretaking, she took relatively easy job handling customer support\ncalls at EV Connect, a small company that makes software for charging\nstations. Before long, the growing company asked her to set up a call center\nand customer experience department.\n\n\u201cThe charging stations would just be having these wonky issues,\u201d she said. At\nthe time, charger companies depended heavily on expensive electricians to fix\nwhat turned out to be software issues, on equipment for which they were not\ntrained. There was, practically speaking, little awareness of the need for a\njob called \u201celectric charger technician.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would be super cool to have a workforce who wants to do that,\u201d she said.\n\nShe left to work as a consultant to Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator. Its chief\nexecutive, Matt Petersen, encouraged her to start a company to train and hire\npeople who could provide technical services to the charging industry. Her\nfirst contract was with Southern California Edison to work on electric school\nbus chargers. The company blasted off from there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTerry \u201cis a superstar who is able to share a vision for people to rally around\nand make things happen,\u201d Petersen said. \u201cHer story and Evette\u2019s story is a\nhero\u2019s journey for us.\u201d\n\nEvette is Evette Ellis, a workforce development expert Terry met at LACI and\nwith whom she felt an immediate rapport. After watching Ellis in action, Terry\nbrought her on at ChargerHelp, and was so impressed she made Ellis a company\nco-founder.\n\nChargerHelp\u2019s founders are Southern California natives \u2014 Evette Ellis, left,\ngrew up in Compton and Kameale Terry in South L.A.\n\n(Michael Blackshire / Los Angeles Times)\n\nEllis, who grew up in Compton, wasn\u2019t sure at first. \u201cThese clean science-y\nwhite folks are good people, and they\u2019re going to save the world, but I didn\u2019t\nnecessarily see myself in that space.\u201d\n\nBut she fit right in. In the podcast interview, Terry said that executives in\ncleantech \u201ctalk about equity a lot, and that\u2019s really cool to be part of.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a young teenager, Ellis recalls, she watched a woman behind the counter at\na pool park daycare center who was obviously in charge and told other people\nwhat to do. \u201cThat was my first introduction to the idea that there\u2019s work, and\nthen there\u2019s the people that provide the job.\u201d She asked to be hired and by\nthe end of the summer had became a program coordinator.\n\nEllis earned her job-training chops at the federal Department of Labor\u2019s Job\nCorps program, whose historic mission is training people who don\u2019t plan to go\nto college for jobs in the trades. Like Terry, she joined LACI as a\nconsultant.\n\nAt ChargerHelp, Ellis set about creating a certified training program for\ncharger technicians, working closely with SAE International, the standards-\nsetting organization for the motor vehicle industry. Training takes roughly\nsix weeks before field deployment.\n\nBeyond the technical material, Ellis emphasizes the importance of attitude.\nGraduating from a training program into a new job is a major step that not\nonly affects the newly employed but future grads as well. \u201cIf you\u2019re not\ngiving it your all, you really are burning a huge bridge,\u201d she says.\n\nA field technician needn\u2019t know software code to do the work. What\u2019s needed is\na basic understanding of how electricity works, how EV chargers work, how\nelectric vehicles work, how to handle software programs on a computer or\nsmartphone in concert with remote experts at a network operations center.\nFederal government certified safety training is an important part of the\nprogram, Ellis said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe kind of job ChargerHelp trains for \u2014 combining familiarity with computer\nsoftware, basic knowledge in electricity and electronics, and a reasonable\ndegree of manual dexterity \u2014 will become increasingly common as software\ncontinues to infiltrate hardware in everyday life, from Ring doorbells to\npersonal robots to apps on a car\u2019s dashboard screen.\n\nHigh school grads can do it; so can those who graduate from college but may be\nlacking skills that match what employers are looking for.\n\nHeaven Holmes of Fresno graduated from Cal State Dominguez Hills in psychology\nand criminal justice last year and was back home job hunting when her mother\nsaw Terry being interviewed by local TV news. Her mom said \u201cthere\u2019s an African\nAmerican woman on TV hiring here.\u201d Something about charger repair. Holmes\napplied, got trained, and became a technician at ChargerHelp.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to expect, but I\u2019m curious and I\u2019m always going to want to\ngain more knowledge,\u201d she said. Every day is a new challenge, she said.\n\nShe\u2019s happy to be in an industry with a future and a chance to move up the\nladder. \u201cThe world is changing, and these jobs aren\u2019t as low profile as you\u2019d\nthink. People are excited when they see a charger that\u2019s been broken down for\nmonths is working.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEV charger field technicians earn $20 to $60 an hour, concentrated in the $35\nto $40 range. Certified electricians make even more. So far, ChargerHelp has\ntrained 1,000 workers and recently began a program to train the trainers for\nother companies and workforce development organizations.\n\nChargerHelp, of course, is far from the only company developing charger\nsoftware and training workers to use it. Charging network companies such as\nFlo, ChargePoint, and Electrify America are expanding training programs of\ntheir own.\n\nSo are charger manufacturers, including ABM. \u201cIt\u2019s important to build\nawareness around the trades in general across America,\u201d said Mark Hawkinson,\nABM\u2019s president of technical solutions. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a depletion of skill\nsets on how to maintain critical infrastructure. Our schools don\u2019t teach shop\nanymore. We need to get back to those basics.\u201d\n\nEven companies that have relied for decades on fossil fuel dispensation have\nbeen moving swiftly into electric vehicle charging, including gas pump\ninstaller and maintainer Owl Services. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen an uptick in the call for\ntechnicians, particularly in the Los Angeles market,\u201d said Owl vice president\nDave Patrick. L.A. represents \u201cthe highest growth potential\u201d for the company\nright now.\n\nMarcus Glenn of Detroit was recently trained by ChargePoint but is keeping his\noptions open. He was employed at an automobile heating and air conditioning\nsupplier when he signed up to learn about charger repair. He successfully\nfinished the course but is sticking with his current job \u2014 for now. The auto\nindustry is undergoing drastic change, and layoffs are constant threat. Glenn\nlikes knowing he\u2019s prepared for the future. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have some form of\nstability. I\u2019ll be looking for those opportunities and see where this leads.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe recommends the move to others. \u201cIf you\u2019re curious about it, be a curious\ncat. Go find out. There\u2019s a lot of ways to get into this industry. There is\nalways going to be work.\u201d\n\nClimate & Environment\n\nFor Subscribers\n\n### Broken chargers, lax oversight: How California\u2019s troubled EV charging\nstations threaten emission goals\n\nWhy are so many California EV charging stations broken?
