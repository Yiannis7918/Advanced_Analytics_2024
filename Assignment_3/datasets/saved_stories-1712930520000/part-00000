Then\nthey drove me out of the academy\n\n### By Rani Neutill\n\n### Published October 28, 2015 10:59PM (EDT)\n\nDoris Day in \"Pillow Talk,\" Michael Kenneth Williams and Michael Kevin Darnall\nin \"The Wire\" (Universal Pictures/HBO)\n\n\\--\n\n### Shares\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nReddit\n\nEmail\n\nsave\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nAbout a year ago I was asked to teach a class about the evolution of the\nrepresentation of sex throughout American Cinema. I started with the silent\nfilm (The Cheat) and ended with Spike Jonze's disembodied sex in Her. Along\nthe way, I showed a number of sexually graphic films that caused a great deal\nof controversy.\n\nAt the time I was teaching the course, I was also figuring out a life outside\nof academia. I had been a wandering postdoc for a long time and was tired. A\nfriend of mine had recently been violently sexually assaulted. I was a\nwitness. The trauma she suffered, from the assault and the long, drawn-out\ntrial of her assailants, led me to volunteer at my local rape crisis center.\nWorking directly with folks who have experienced trauma, I entered the course\nbelieving in trigger warnings and gave them throughout the class, even though\nit seemed as though the title of the course was a trigger warning in and of\nitself. Regardless, I gave them for almost every film I showed. I even gave\nthem for films that really shouldn't have needed them (i.e., Psycho).\n\nMidway through the semester, because of my work in sexual assault prevention,\nI was asked to fill in for the Director of the Office of Sexual Assault\nPrevention Services at the university. The Director had to take a short leave\nso I was there to fill in temporarily. In accepting the position, I took on a\ndual role. First, I was an activist against sexual violence, supporting\nsurvivors on campus, but I was also an educator who believed that learning is\nabout shaking up one\u2019s world and worldview. I didn't realize that occupying\nboth roles at once would be impossible; failure was inevitable.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe first \"uh-oh\" moment came when was when I taught Pillow Talk with Rock\nHudson and Doris Day. Rock Hudson plays the role of a womanizer (the irony of\nall this, of course, is that he was closeted). When he gets women into his\nhome there are a series of \"booby traps\" meant for getting it on (who says\nthat anymore? me). One seemed like a literal trap--the door locks itself shut.\nI suggested that this might be a predatory act. The class was suddenly divided\n--there were the ones who vehemently believed that Hudson's character was a\nrapist, and those who vehemently argued that he was not. This divide would get\ndeeper and uglier throughout the semester, with me caught irrevocably in the\nmiddle.\n\nNext, I assigned a reading by Linda Williams, a chapter from her book,\nScreening Sex. It looked in intimate detail at the first blaxploitation film\never made-- Melvin Van Peebles', Sweet Sweetback's Badasssss Song (SSBAS). The\nchapter outlined (with pictures), the plot of the movie and all the sexual\nacts that were in the film. Williams\u2019 argument is that Blaxploitation and\nSSBAS arose from a reclamation of masculinity by black men who were\nhistorically emasculated and castrated (think of the killing of Emmett Till).\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nI assumed everyone had done the reading. I showed one of the scenes that\nWilliams' writes about in detail. Before I screened it, I gave a warning,\nindicating that it was one of the disturbing scenes to which Williams refers.\nThe scene shows a young Sweetback (played by the director\u2019s son Melvin Van\nPeebles) having sex with a 30-year old woman. She finds him irresistible and\nthus starts the hyper-sexual evolution of Sweetback--every woman on earth\nwants to fuck him, including a whole bunch of white women. This, of course, is\nstatutory rape. When the lights went on and the scene was over, two students\nleft the room in tears. I was perplexed. I started to ask questions about\nWilliams' reading, how it felt to read about and then watch the scene, what\nquestions of race and masculinity it provoked. Crickets man, crickets. Clearly\nno one had done the reading.\n\nLater that day, I had a white female student come to my office hours crying.\nBetween picking up tissues and blowing her nose she said, \"I'm doing a minor\nin African American Studies. How could your first images of black people be\nthat horrible?\" I told her that I understood her concerns. I went on to\nexplain how the class was a historical look at sex on screen and as the\nreading for the class articulated, it was one of the first film's to show\nblack people having sex and was important to film history. She still didn't\nget it. She said I had to show some positive images, otherwise it was unfair,\nthat the other students weren't African American Studies minors so they didn't\nunderstand race politics as she did. I told her that I would bring a positive\nimage to the next class to address her concerns. Finally, she smiled.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThat night I went home and thought about it, hard. Isn't confronting difficult\nissues what learning is about? My classes were about race, gender, and\nsexuality. These are inherently uncomfortable topics that force students to\nthink critically about their privilege and their place in the hierarchy of\nthis world.\n\nIt's not fun to talk about inequality. It's not fun to talk about slavery.\nIt's not fun to talk about the complexity of sexual desire. It's terribly,\nterribly, uncomfortable. But it was my job as their teacher to navigate\nthrough this discomfort. I felt like I handled the class poorly. I had\nkowtowed too much, so I went to class the next day prepared to break this shit\ndown.\n\nI also thought about a positive image of black sexuality and sex. I decided to\nshow a clip from The Wire that shows Omar in bed with his boyfriend just after\nhaving sex, a tender moment where they kiss. Omar's character, a black, gay\ndude who steals from drug dealers, is a revolutionary representation of black\nmasculinity that stands in stark contrast to SSBAS. I was excited to show it.\nI mean, it\u2019s The Wire: who doesn't want to talk about The Wire?\n\nI began class by talking briefly about learning through discomfort. The\nstudents were silent. I turned to them for questions about moments of feeling\nuncomfortable and how we could read these as productive. The student who came\nto my office raised her hand and asked, \"Are we gonna talk about SSBAS.\"\n\nAdvertisement:\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, \u201cbut I want us to talk about any of the films that made people\nuncomfortable. Let\u2019s discuss the discomfort.\" Her face fell. She started\ncrying and ran out of the room. Her friend followed her. Right after she left\nI showed the scene with Omar. Later that day, she came to my office again,\nsobbing.\n\nFor the rest of the semester, I gave trigger warnings before every scene I\nscreened. Every. Single. One. This wasn't enough. A student came to me and\nasked that I start sending emails before class outlining exactly which\ndisturbing scenes I would be showing so that I wouldn't \u201cout\u201d survivors if\nthey had to walk out of class when hearing what I was about to show. This took\nall the free form and off the cuff ability to teach. It stifled the teaching\nprocess. There would never be a moment for me to educate them by confronting\nthem with the unknown, by helping them become aware of their own biases by\nmaking them feel uncomfortable.\n\nNevertheless, I did it. Each night I sent a meticulous email detailing which\nscene I was showing, where in the film the scene was, and what the content of\nthe scene included. My role as a sexual assault prevention services specialist\nand survivor advocate eclipsed my role as a professor as I tried to\naccommodate students over and over again.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe next film to piss them all off was 9 1/2 Weeks. The film is about a S&M\nrelationship between a character played by Micky Rourke and one played by Kim\nBasinger. At first Basinger's character is drawn to Rourke and they begin an\nS&M style consensual relationship. As the film goes on, Rourke becomes abusive\nand the sex becomes non-consensual, but the beauty of the film is that\nBasinger is eventually able to let go and take something from the relationship\n--a heightened sense of her sexuality and desires. There's an infamous scene\nwith Rourke feeding Basinger a number of food items while she's blindfolded.\nIt\u2019s basically a series of soft core money shots. It is a consensual scene.\nWhen conversation began in class, a white male student started talking about\nthe scene as one of consent. Four hands shot up. One said, \u201cno\u2014it is clearly\nnot consensual.\u201d Other students concurred. They argued that if someone is in\nan abusive relationship, they can never consent to sex because they are being\nmanipulated.\n\nThis triggered me. I was furious.\n\nSexual assault survivor support is about empowerment. The model says, \"Hey!\nIt\u2019s not for you to tell the survivor what happened to them; that's their\nstory, they know, don't fucking label it.\" What these students were\nessentially doing was stripping every person in an abusive relationship of all\ntheir agency. They were telling every survivor that they were raped, even when\nthe survivor may have wanted to have sex with their abuser. They were claiming\ngod like knowledge of every sexual encounter. And they were only 20. If that.\nTheir frontal lobes haven't even fully developed.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nI was done with it. I was drained. I was anxious. I was tired. I was fed up.\nBut I didn't want to be. I had been teaching for ten years with passion.\n\nI went to get advice from a colleague in the department. He listened and said\nthat during that time of the semester, students tended to get testy. He\nthought it was seasonal. I asked him if he ever had such a hard time with his\nstudents and he said, \"No, I am an old white dude, I really think that as a\nyoung woman of color they probably just aren't afraid of you, they see you as\na peer.\" For the record, I'm not that young but he may have been right. And\nhere's the irony, all of the students who were upset were the feminists, the\nactivists, and there they were, treating a woman of color professor like she\nwasn't an authority while treating old white dudes like they are.\n\nThere has been a lot written about triggering and trigger warnings,\ndiscussions about how triggers are often not explicit references to one\u2019s\ntraumatic experiences. Smells, tastes, different objects, they can all be\ntriggering. Think of Proust's madeleine and the surge of memories about his\nmother. Memory, emotional trauma, grief and healing are complicated and unique\nto an individual\u2019s experience. Blanket trigger warnings treat them as\nimpersonal predictable entities. The current movement of calling for trigger\nwarnings prioritizes the shielding of students from the traumatic, whereas,\nironically, so many other therapeutic models focus on talking through and\nconfronting trauma as a mode of healing.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nRecent work by Greg Lukainoff and Jonathan Haidt looks in depth at this\nphenomenon, the call for safe spaces and trigger warnings. Their tone could be\nread as condescending to people who are survivors of trauma, but I do think\nthey raise a number of important points. Similarly, the work of Laura Kipnis\non trigger warnings is crucial and illuminating, but in an unfortunate and\nsometimes typical academic fashion, it can be snobbish and dismissive (Jack\nHalberstam is also in this camp). Here lies the problem. Taking a tone like\nthat just pisses students off even more. I'm not saying that if we said these\nthings nicely, students would suddenly get it; they won't. I am living proof\nof that. I\u2019m just pointing out the fact that putting on an academic face of\nelite speak isn't helping either. Maybe pointing out the horrifying political\nstance these students are making would be more effective.\n\nWhen a Duke Student refuses to read a book because it has lesbian sex in it\nand students who are liberal, who are activists, also refuse to read and watch\nthings because they see it as triggering, we see the collusion of the right\nand left wing. When I get an evaluation from this course that says, \"as a\nwhite male heterosexual I felt unsafe in this course,\" and another that reads,\n\"as a survivor this course was traumatizing,\" we are at a moment that needs\nsome radical re-thinking. Do students of a radical nature think that if they\nare seeing eye to eye with the most extreme conservative element of the\npopulation that they are doing something right? Fighting for something\npositive? Participating in something different?\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nI don't have the answers. Hell, I gave up on the whole thing. This was the\nlast straw for me. I didn\u2019t know the answers but I knew this was a crisis.\nColleges are the new helicopter parents, places where the quest for emotional\nsafety and psychic healing leads not to learning, but regression.\n\nI don't know about trigger warnings outside classes that deal with race,\ngender and sexuality, but I do know that if you promote trigger warnings in\nsubjects that are supposed to make people feel uncomfortable, you're basically\npromoting a culture of extreme privilege, cause I'm pretty sure that the trans\nwomen who are being murdered weekly, the black men who are victims of police\nbrutality daily, and the neighborhoods in America that are plagued by everyday\nviolence, aren\u2019t given any trigger warnings. Let\u2019s be honest: life is a\ntrigger.\n\n### By Rani Neutill\n\nStudent at The Startup Institute; Server at the Miracle of Science; recovering\nacademic, and a surviving feminist, Baltimore City lover, lives in Cambridge,\nMA.\n\nMORE FROM Rani Neutill\n\n## Related Topics ------------------------------------------\n\nAcademia Aol_on Campus Sexual Assault Editor's Pick Life Stories Trigger\nWarning\n\n## Related Articles\n\nAdvertisement:\n\n  * Home\n  * About\n  * Staff\n  * Contact\n  * Privacy\n  * Terms of Service\n  * Archive\n  * Go Ad Free\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Salon.com, LLC.
