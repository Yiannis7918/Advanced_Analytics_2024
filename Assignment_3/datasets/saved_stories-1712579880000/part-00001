In most rich\ncountries annual core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy\nprices, has fallen from peaks of 5-8% to a more tolerable 3-5%. In defiance of\npessimistic economists, there has been no accompanying economic slump. Growth\nvaries from booming (America) to respectable (Australia, Canada, Japan) to\ntepid (Britain, the euro area), but nowhere has it collapsed. In contrast to\nthe disinflation of the 1980s, unemployment has stayed low. Has the world\neconomy enjoyed salvation without sacrifice?

After ruthless monetary tightening in the 1980s,\nfollowed by a movement towards independent central banks targeting inflation,\nprice surges seemed as outdated as shoulder pads.
