It does an admirable job of delivering. But the other day,\nwhen I instructed the software to give the Crane treatment to a plate of ice-\ncream sandwiches, I felt bored before I even saw the answer. \u201cThe oozing\ncream, like time, escapes our grasp, / Each moment slipping with a silent\ngasp.\u201d This was fine. It was competent. I read the poem, Slacked part of it to\na colleague, and closed the window. Whatever.\n\nA year and a half has passed since generative AI captured the public\nimagination and my own. For many months, the fees I paid to ChatGPT and\nMidjourney felt like money better spent than the cost of my Netflix\nsubscription, even just for entertainment. I\u2019d sit on the couch and generate\ncheeseburger kaiju while Bridgerton played, unwatched, before me. But now that\ntime is over. The torpor that I felt in asking for Hart Crane\u2019s ode to an ice-\ncream sandwich seemed to mark the end point of a brief, glorious phase in the\nhistory of technology. Generative AI appeared as if from nowhere, bringing\nmagic, both light and dark. If the curtain on that show has now been drawn,\nit\u2019s not because AI turned out to be a flop. Just the opposite: The tools that\nit enables have only slipped into the background, from where they will exert\ntheir greatest influence.\n\nLooking back at my ChatGPT history, I used to ask for Hart Crane\u2013ice-cream\nstuff all the time. An Emily Dickinson poem about Sizzler (\u201cIn Sizzler\u2019s\nembrace, we find our space / Where simple joys and flavors interlace\u201d). Edna\nSt. Vincent Millay on Beverly Hills, 90210 (\u201cIn sun-kissed land where palm\ntrees sway / Jeans of stone-wash in a bygone day\u201d). Biz Markie and then Eazy-E\nverses about the (real!) Snoop Dogg cereal Frosted Drizzlerz. A blurb about\nRainbow Brite in the style of the philosopher Jacques Derrida. I asked for\nthese things, at first, just to see what each model was capable of doing, to\nexplore how it worked. I found that AI had the uncanny ability to blend\nconcepts both precisely and creatively.\n\nRead: The AI Mona Lisa explains everything\n\nLast autumn, I wrote in The Atlantic that, at its best, generative AI could be\nused as a tool to supercharge your imagination. I\u2019d been using DALL-E to give\na real-ish form to almost any notion that popped into my head. One weekend, I\nspent most of a family outing stealing moments to build out the fictional,\n120-year history of a pear-flavored French soft drink called P\u2019Poire. Then\nthere was Trotter, a cigarette made by and for pigs. I\u2019ve spent so many hours\non these sideline pranks that the products now feel real to me. They are real,\nat least in the way that any fiction\u2014Popeye, Harry Potter\u2014can be real.\n\nBut slowly, invisibly, the work of really using AI took over. While\nresearching a story about lemon-lime flavor, I asked ChatGPT to give me an\noverview of the U.S. market for beverages with this ingredient, but had to do\nmy own research to confirm the facts. In the course of working out new\nprograms of study for my university department, I had the software assess and\ndevise possible names. Neither task produced a fraction of the delight that\nI\u2019d once derived from just a single AI-generated phrase, \u201cjeans of stone-\nwash.\u201d But at least the latter gave me what I needed at the time: a workable\nmediocrity.\n\nI still found some opportunities to supercharge my imagination, but those\nbecame less frequent over time. In their place, I assigned AI the mule-worthy\nburden of mere tasks. Faced with the question of which wait-listed students to\nadmit into an overenrolled computer-science class, I used ChatGPT to apply the\nrelevant and complicated criteria. (If a parent or my provost is reading this,\nI did not send any student\u2019s actual name or personal data to OpenAI.) In need\nof a project website on short order, I had the service create one far more\nquickly than I could have by hand. When I wanted to analyze the full corpus of\nWordle solutions for a recent story on the New York Times games library, I\nasked for help from OpenAI\u2019s Data Analyst. Nobody had promised me any of this,\nso having something that kind of worked felt like a gift.\n\nThe more imaginative uses of AI were always bound to buckle under this actual\nutility. A year ago, university professors like me were already fretting over\nthe technology\u2019s practical consequences, and we spent many weeks debating\nwhether and how universities could control the use of large language models in\nassignments. Indeed, for students, generative AI seemed obviously and\nimmediately productive: Right away, it could help them write college essays\nand do homework. (Teachers found lots of ways to use it, too.) The\napplications seemed to grow and grow. In November, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said\nthe ChatGPT service had 100 million weekly users. In January, the job-ratings\nwebsite Glassdoor put out a survey finding that 62 percent of professionals,\nincluding 77 percent of those in marketing, were using ChatGPT at work. And\nlast month, Pew Research Center reported that almost half of American adults\nbelieve they interact with AI, in one form or another, several times a week at\nleast.\n\nRead: Things get strange when AI starts training itself\n\nThe rapid adoption was in part a function of AI\u2019s novelty\u2014without initial\ninterest, nothing can catch on. But that user growth could be sustained only\nby the technology\u2019s transition into something unexciting. Inventions become\nimportant not when they offer a glimpse of some possible future\u2014as, say, the\nApple Vision Pro does right now\u2014but when they\u2019re able to recede into the\nbackground, to become mundane. Of course you have a smartphone. Of course you\nhave a refrigerator, a television, a microwave, an automobile. These\ntechnologies are not\u2014which is to say, they are no longer\u2014delightful.\n\nNot all inventions lose their shimmer right away, but the ones that change the\nworld won\u2019t take long to seem humdrum. I already miss the feeling of\nenchantment that came from making new Hart Crane poems or pear-soft-drink ad\ncampaigns. I miss the joy of seeing any imaginable idea brought instantly to\nlife. But whatever nostalgia one might have for the early days of ChatGPT and\nDALL-E will be no less fleeting in the end. First the magic fades, then the\nnostalgia. This is what happens to a technology that\u2019s taking over. This is a\nmeasure of its power.\n\nIan Bogost is a contributing writer at The Atlantic.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
