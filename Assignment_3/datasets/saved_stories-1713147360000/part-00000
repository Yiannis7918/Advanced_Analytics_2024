Our first contribution is Optimised Attention, which\n> performs similarly to standard attention, but has 3/4 as many parameters and\n> one matrix multiplication fewer per head. Next, we introduce Efficient\n> Attention, which performs on par with standard attention with only 1/2 as\n> many parameters as many parameters and two matrix multiplications fewer per\n> head and is up to twice as fast as standard attention. Lastly, we introduce\n> Super Attention, which surpasses standard attention by a significant margin\n> in both vision and natural language processing tasks while having fewer\n> parameters and matrix multiplications. In addition to providing rigorous\n> mathematical comparisons, we evaluate the presented attention mechanisms on\n> MNIST, CIFAR100, IMDB Movie Reviews, and Amazon Reviews datasets.\n\nSubjects:| Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI);\nComputation and Language (cs.CL); Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition\n(cs.CV)  \n---|---  \nMSC classes:| 68T07 (Primary) 68T45, 68T50, 68T10, 15A03, 15A04 (Secondary)  \nACM classes:| I.2.6; I.2.7; I.2.10; I.4.0; I.5.0; I.7.0  \nCite as:| arXiv:2403.01643 [cs.LG]  \n(or arXiv:2403.01643v1 [cs.LG] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2403.01643arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Mehran Hosseini [view email] [v1] Sun, 3 Mar 2024 23:40:35 UTC (78 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled You Need to Pay Better Attention, by Mehran\nHosseini and 1 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.LG\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2403\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI cs.CL cs.CV\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\nIArxiv Recommender (What is IArxiv?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
