It happens. It is not useful to dig into the reasons that pushed me\nto express my concerns about our partnership, but as we were on the verge of\nlaunching a new fund, timing was of essence in order to do the right things by\nall our stakeholders.\n\nWe still had a couple of deals to execute with our first fund and\nresponsibilities towards our investors and entrepreneurs. We had managed to\nwork together for the past three to four years, I didn\u2019t see any reasons why\nwe couldn\u2019t handle an amicable separation while preserving what we had built.\nMy full commitment was intact.\n\nTherefore, I thought that the most elegant way to do this was to leave the\ncontrol to my co-founder, reduce my fees significantly, commit 100% to our\nentrepreneurs obviously and let our investors know about it and act upon their\nwill regarding our second fund. That\u2019s what I proposed, very simply.\n\nIt looks like I had underestimated our difference of opinion about what was\nthe right and moral thing to do in this situation.\n\nA few days later, I was asked by my partner who would be my lawyer. I was\nsurprised. A lawyer? What for? I\u2019m giving away the vast majority of the\neconomics after having contributed beyond expectations. We just have to let\npeople know and act professionally thereafter.\n\nI realized that I had been fooled when a few weeks later I was asked to jump\non a quick call...\n\n\u201c Jean, either you help me close a second fund for which you will remain\nactive on paper, or I will fire you for cause because you\u2019ve let Xavier know\nabout the situation. I know this because I have collected your personal emails\nin our company CRM. \u201d\n\nSeriously ?\n\n\u201c Pia, I don\u2019t see how I could morally do this. \u201d\n\nI will spare you all the crispy details because at this point, it\u2019s just about\nexplaining in plain words what concretely happened. The rest is just blood for\nvampires and the communications and public affairs firm hired by my former\nbusiness partner is already doing an amazing job at fuelling imaginary\nfallacies out there.\n\nI have always done the right thing by our entrepreneurs and investors. The\nright thing was to deploy our first fund in the best possible conditions. We\nmanaged to do so but it was impossible to go beyond this milestone. It felt\nright to take the responsibility. I thought we would simply let our investors\nknow and that we would act upon their will, candidly.\n\nThat didn\u2019t happen and I regret that.\n\nBack in 2020, I gave away 60% of the management company because I didn\u2019t know\nhow much I would contribute to the success of New Wave. Imposteur syndrome\nthey call it... It\u2019s now playing against me and consequently our other\nstakeholders.\n\nIn retrospect, we could have had that discussion sooner, around Q4 2023, not\nthat the outcome would have been any different. Before that, I didn\u2019t want to\nput my former partner in a stressful situation.\n\nI wish all our investors had been informed about the situation. Most weren\u2019t\neven told I was fired. Legally, I wasn\u2019t in a position to do so unfortunately\nbut whether we talk about our entrepreneurs or investors, I hope they don\u2019t\nhave a single doubt that I intend to always do the right thing by them.\n\nNow what ?\n\nNo need to convince anyone about my commitment to entrepreneurs. I share as\nmuch as I can, as honestly and efficiently as I can.\n\nEvery week is a learning expedition, it\u2019s extraordinarily rewarding and\nexciting, I\u2019m like a kid in a theme park, I keep doing that same rollercoaster\nover and over again, and every single time it\u2019s a thrill. It\u2019s been 10 years!\n\nWe lose more than we win. Everything takes time. Our hopes get shattered in\nthousands pieces, but we remain eternally optimistic and excited, we rise to\ntry again cause it\u2019s not about the destination, it\u2019s about the journey.\n\nI share this journey with people full of dedication and good energy. We share\nthe same ambition, the same values, the same love for what we\u2019re doing.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, the current situation is time consuming and sometimes\npainful.\n\nI like when things happen organically, that\u2019s how I got to land my dream job,\nthrough the fortunate combination of many small pieces. A couple of days ago,\nI received a notification from one of our founders, Steeve... He just tweeted\na \u2764\ufe0f.\n\nBefore I could even realise it, I was receiving tons of support, sometimes\nfrom founders I had worked with years ago or investors I had collaborated with\na long time ago. I am immensely grateful for all that support.\n\nMy eyes are clear, My heart is full.\n\n### Subscribe to Venture Prose\n\nBy Jean de La Rochebrochard \u00b7 Launched 4 years ago\n\nSharing bits and pieces of my weekly learnings as a supporter of courageous\nentrepreneurs :)\n\n30 Likes\n\n30\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Clear Eyes , Full Heart\n\n2lr.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nMy Pitch Framework\n\nThe rules of a good pitch\n\nFeb 18 \u2022\n\nJean de La Rochebrochard\n\n76\n\nShare this post\n\n#### My Pitch Framework\n\n2lr.substack.com\n\nUnder The Hood Of Kima Ventures\n\nXavier shared with me recently the excellent piece of Fabrice Grinda about FJ\nLabs Investment Strategy.
