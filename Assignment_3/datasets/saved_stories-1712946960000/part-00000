From Software-as-a-Service to\nService-as-a-Software.\n\nThe big picture: the rise of AI workers is creating a fusion of the software\nand labor market. This is going to create massive opportunities for Founders.\n\n## Labor and Software Are Becoming One Market\n\nSaaS companies have historically brought analog processes into the digital\nworld. They were aimed at making certain aspects of existing job descriptions\neasier to manage.\n\nBut SaaS could never run itself. It always required a company to maintain a\nworkforce to operate that software.\n\nFor example, you could purchase a SaaS sales tool but you still had to hire,\nand train a salesperson to do the work.\n\nAcross the whole economy, this means the labor market, and the software\nmarkets have been separate \u2013 and within a company, the hiring budget has\nalways been orders of magnitude larger than the software budget.\n\nIf you run a very rough calculation, US businesses spend upwards of $5\ntrillion on knowledge workforces. By comparison, companies spend about $230\nbillion on B2B SaaS.\n\nNow, software can both organize and execute tasks. Labor and software are\nfusing into one massive market.\n\nThis opportunity, however, is not just about market expansion. It\u2019s also about\nmargin expansion.\n\nIn this labor transition, we expect the historical margin gap between service\nbusinesses (below 30%) and SaaS businesses (above 80%) to shrink as AI\nservices replace human-centric services enabled by SaaS tools. Service margins\nwill become software margins.\n\nMarket and margin expansions combined are creating opportunities for new tech\ncompanies to emerge in areas not yet touched by traditional software.\n\nNote that these estimates only tackle knowledge work. We expect this concept\nto expand into more manual tasks as well. This will happen as new bridges\nbetween Generative AI and the physical world are created in the future.\nConstruction and manufacturing, large sections of the labor market, are likely\nthe first to witness these changes. (We have briefly covered the emergence of\nthis in construction here).\n\nWe do expect some roles to disappear as this fusion accelerates. But AI is\nlikely to create a form of Jevons paradox in the long run \u2013 where increased\nefficiency leads to a short term reduction in a resource, but a long-term\nsurge in demand that creates more resource use.\n\nApplied here, that means we expect to see more demand for these types of\nservices in the future, providing more job opportunities. To aid with that, AI\nalso provides the opportunity for rapid workforce re-skilling, allowing people\nto shift careers and align themselves with those opportunities.\n\nLabor is going to be \u201cbaked in\u201d to any software an enterprise buys. Meet your\nnew AI colleagues.\n\n## Two Approaches to \u201cAI Workforce\u201d Companies\n\nSo far, we\u2019re seeing two dominant approaches to building companies in this\nspace.\n\n### 1\\. Sell \u201cAI Colleagues\u201d (Internal)\n\nThe first approach is to sell into an existing job description.\n\nA good example of this would be Devin, Cognition Lab\u2019s \u201cAI software engineer.\u201d\n\nFirst, Devin works across the whole software engineer\u2019s workflow. It\nencounters issues and finds solutions, and tells you what it\u2019s doing along the\nway. It works like human labor \u2013 down to the communication styles.\n\nOther examples in this vein would be 11x or Artisan, companies creating\n\u201cdigital SDRs.\u201d In this case, Alice and Ava are able to book 2-3 prospective\nclient meetings per week, work 24/7, and work across the whole sales\ntechnology stack. In the legal space, our portfolio company EvenUp has\nreplaced the demand letter writing process with AI automation.\n\nFinally, a company on the leading edge of this developing space would be\nNVIDIA and Hippocratic.ai\u2019s AI-powered healthcare agents. These AI \u201cnurses\u201d\nconduct patient interviews, perform health-risk assessments, and perform post-\noperative follow ups.\n\nIn this case, AI falls short of providing the whole spectrum of care provided\nby a human nurse, but may lessen the burden on human nurses (currently in the\nmidst of a prolonged labor shortage).\n\nHere we see a developing spectrum of \u201cAI colleagues.\u201d They are not only adept\nat basic job functions, but also posses a range of \u201csoft skills\u201d that make\nthem more like colleagues than software.\n\n### 2\\. Sell \u201cAI Vendors/ Services\u201d (External)\n\nThe second approach is to automate an entire workflow that would typically\nencompass many different jobs. This concept will basically replace the work\nprovided by an entire service business. E.g. a full stack AI law firm, an AI\nbroker, etc.\n\nThis comes in several flavors.\n\nThe first flavor, and what we see a lot of right now, is a re-imagination of\nthe existing BPO.\n\nThis is likely to happen in fields like: customer service, Sales, marketing,\nfinance & accounting, supply chain management (logistics & procurement), legal\nservices, data collection/entry/analysis, human resources, translation &\nlocalization, software development, quality assurance, cybersecurity, or\nconstruction takeoff and estimation.\n\nWe\u2019re already seeing this happen. Our portfolio company Smith.ai has developed\nAI-powered customer service agents specifically for SMBs. Their platform can\nrespond to customer calls and messages 24/7, with the accuracy usually\nrequired by hiring large teams of human specialists.\n\nThe second flavor is the creation of a new type of \u201cfirm\u201d that couldn\u2019t exist\nunder one roof without AI.\n\nThe key to this playbook is to seek fragmented processes that require multiple\nstakeholders. Architecture or renovation services are other great examples of\nthis because of equal ratios of analog and digital tasks.\n\nThis category of business is capable of encompassing both the \u201cservices\u201d\nmarket and the \u201clabor/employee\u201d market. In both cases, you deliver human-\nquality labor with software margins.\n\nAn added benefit is that this trend also creates an opportunity to disrupt\nSaaS incumbents. First, certain SaaS tools will become superfluous as AI\nservice providers build the tools they need internally. Secondly, there may be\nbusiness model conflicts. The pay-per-seat models increases revenues provided\nheadcount keeps increasing \u2013 and initially, AI workforces will decrease that\nheadcount.\n\nOverall, SaaS spending may go down, disrupt SaaS incumbents, and create more\nspace for startups.\n\nWhich is why this opportunity is truly big. Even bigger than enterprise\nsoftware.\n\n## Where Will AI Workers First Dominate?\n\nThe biggest opportunities will exist where the unit economics of hiring AI are\n100x better than the unit economics of hiring or subcontracting a person to do\nthe job. Under those conditions, for AI workers will thrive.\n\nThat is usually achieved via a combination of AI\u2019s cost-cutting capabilities\n(automating repetitive work etc), AND AI\u2019s added value (driving greater\nrevenues via enhanced personalization).\n\nHere\u2019s how we look for spaces with those characteristics:\n\nFirst, we ask: where does AI excel where human labor may be weak?\n\nThere are several key factors here:\n\n  * Large amount of process is automatable. This includes simple, repetitive, high volume tasks. This likely does not include complex, multi-step, bespoke tasks, initially.\n  * Human labor is particularly expensive.\n  * Hiring is difficult and there are poor labor market dynamics (including worker shortages and attrition)\n  * Long \u201ctime to ROI\u201d for human workers (e.g. significant onboarding/ training required)\n  * High level of tool fragmentation, which provides an opportunity to consolidate tools into one top layer.\n  * High fault tolerance: i.e. the stakes are not life or death.\n  * Fields with large amounts of training data \u2013 preferably proprietary\n\nAn example of areas where AI excels here would be legal document inquiry,\naccount payable positions, social media content moderation, data entry, or\nbasic customer service.\n\nSecond, we ask: Where does AI add additional value that may go beyond that of\na human worker?\n\n  * Personalization will drive significant customer value\n  * Speed is a key factor in service quality, and 24/7 service matters\n  * Heterogeneity is a hindrance to high quality service\n\nTo illustrate both, let\u2019s take education for example. There are cost\nadvantages to AI tutors over human teachers (about 80x cheaper, if you compare\nKhan Academy\u2019s AI tutor to the salary of a public school teacher, for\nexample).\n\nWhile it is unlikely that AI will replace public school teachers in our\nlifetime, we will likely see AI play an increasingly large role in education\nin other ways. The more transformational application of this technology is in\nthe additional market for customized education that these AI tutors create.\n\nAI tutors are available 24/7. In theory, they should be able to instantly\ntailor teaching styles to student needs. It\u2019s instant personalized learning\nthat can happen outside of a traditional classroom.\n\nThis is an area where we see AI-driven industry expansion, rather than AI-\ndriven automation and replacement.\n\n## Who Will Be the First to Adopt AI Workers?\n\nWe expect the first adopters to be operations-heavy companies or SMBs. These\nAI companies should open additional pathways to scale for these businesses,\nwhich have traditionally scaled linearly with labor, and are constrained by\ntheir ability to add new employees.\n\nNow they\u2019ll be able to increase their workforce at the click of a button. And\nequally decrease it, accessing infinite scale and flexibility.\n\nFor these businesses AI provides infinite leverage, at lower costs, and better\noutcomes. For these types of businesses, that\u2019s transformational.\n\nAI works 24/7. It doesn\u2019t have bad days. And there are cases where an AI work\nproduct may naturally be better than that of a human worker.\n\nFrom there we see a few other contenders:\n\n  * Fast growing businesses, such as tech startups, that are struggling to hire for specific job functions at a sufficient pace.\n  * Private-equity-backed rollups hyper focused on operational efficiency (who may otherwise resort to layoffs)\n  * Solopreneurs who face a variety of challenges in areas where they don\u2019t have experience and it does not make sense to hire full-time human employees, which explains why they already spend billions per year on freelancers.\n  * Large incumbents with high turnover, low-margin businesses driven by big human workforces. A strategy could be to target industries with the lowest ratio of revenue per employee. Or businesses in industries that have traditionally scaled revenue linearly with labor.\n\nSoon, huge businesses will be run by just three (or perhaps fewer) people.\nThese AI colleagues/vendors are a large part of this transition.\n\n## Why Startups Have a Head Start\n\nIn the AI era, there\u2019s always a question of who reaps greater rewards:\nstartups or incumbents? There are ample opportunities for startups here for\nseveral reasons:\n\n### Advantage 1: The Specialization Advantage\n\nFoundational models or large incumbents might be in a good position to\nautomate most requests. But it is likely they will struggle to automate that\nfinal 10-20 percent of tasks.\n\nLook at the performance of Devin compared to coding functions in ChatGPT or\nother LLMs:\n\nSpecialized AI workers will likely out-perform AI incumbents at first because\nthey are performing very specific knowledge work where perfection matters.\nCode that\u2019s \u201cclose enough\u201d isn\u2019t a good enough proposition for a software\ncompany.\n\nThis is where specialized startups, with niche data, and a human in the loop\nwill vastly outperform unfocused incumbents, and gain market share in the\nopening innings of this transition.\n\n### Advantage 2: Business Model Conflicts Create Opportunities\n\nEventually, every company and service provider will need to adopt AI to remain\ncompetitive. But this may not be the case right out of the gate. In classic\nInnovator\u2019s Dilemma fashion, incumbent service providers in certain industries\nwill stumble with the adoption of a new technology. This presents large\nopportunities for startups.\n\nTake legal services as an example. A white-glove law firm that works on a\nbillable hours model may initially resist taking on AI if it reduces the\namount of hours per client. Since keeping the number of clients constant will\nreduce their overall revenue.\n\nIn this context, imagine a full stack AI Law Firm (startup) comes along that\ncan provide compatible services to the white-glove firm, at a fraction of the\ncost, across far more cases and clients. They may begin to steal market share\naway from the white glove law firm, despite not having the same brand\nrecognition.\n\nThese business model conflicts present rare moments of network restructuring.\nThis advantage window will close as the previous generation adapts, but\nstartups that gain preferential attachment will be better positioned to fight\nfor market share long-term.\n\nMassive businesses can be built by capitalizing on this fast.\n\n### Advantage 3: Faster Paths to Enterprise Selling\n\nEvery company is considering adopting AI right now, or is at least being\npressured to do so. This means that the willingness to work with startups is\nhigher than it has been in the past.\n\nOf course, some companies will choose to build these automations themselves.\nBut others may choose to work with a startup early on.\n\nEven if an incumbent manages to automate one aspect of their operations in\nhouse, it\u2019s unlikely they will do that for every arm of the business.\n\nWhile incumbents focus on rolling out these services to their customers,\nthere\u2019s room for startups to sell directly into enterprises/ incumbents\nthemselves.\n\n## The Near Future: Software with a Soul\n\nInitially, many of these Service-as-a-Software companies will just look like\nautomation. You might automate away 99 percent of the daily \u201cadmin\u201d tasks.\n\nFor labor and software to truly become one market, some companies will need to\ngo beyond this. The companies that will complete the fusion process will have\na degree of \u201chumanness.\u201d\n\nThis is because truly good service isn\u2019t just efficient. It\u2019s delightful.\n\nExisting automation excels at relatively simple tasks: ordering food, sending\ncash. Removing friction is hugely effective here. But if something is complex,\nor disordered...you still end up on the phone with a representative.\n\nFor software to truly replace services, there has to be relatability, room for\nthe disorder inherent in human use, mistakes, and patient understanding.\nRemoval of friction isn\u2019t sufficient. It has to look, and feel, like\ninteracting with a person.\n\nPut differently, this software has to have, in some ways, soul. That soul\ncould exist in different ways, from a magical and intuitive user interface to\na thoughtful personalized \u201cpersonality.\u201d\n\nThis next wave of AI automation will understand and adapt to the user, the\nsame way a great customer service agent, or sales agent, or service provider\ndoes.\n\nWe\u2019re already starting to see AI develop these emotional intelligence skills,\nlike Hume.AI, based on a \u201cempathic large language model\u201d that intakes\nsubtleties of human communication, like tone, voice modulation, etc.\n\nAs the tasks we look to automate become more complex, this \u201csoul\u201d becomes more\nimportant. This is how AI will be able to truly become useful in sectors that\nrequire a more hands on approach, like education, therapy, or healthcare.\n\nIn the long term, software with a soul may endure far beyond software that\nseeks to automate repetitive tasks.\n\nIt\u2019s the final step of the true fusion of software and labor. It\u2019s not here\nquite yet, but it is coming.\n\nIf you\u2019re building in this space, reach out to us.\n\nThanks to Brandon Nydick for notes on this essay.\n\nSubscribe for more Generative AI insights\n\nGet our weekly newsletter that 258K+ startup teams read\n\nPete Flint\n\nGeneral Partner\n\nAnna Pi\u00f1ol\n\nPrincipal\n\nAs Founders ourselves, we respect your time.
