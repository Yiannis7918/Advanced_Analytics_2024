It's fast. And it's fun!\n\nHow to Optimize AI?\n\nWhich is most important for AI workloads: computational performance, cost or\nportability?\n\nComputational performance\n\nCost\n\nPortability\n\nNo preference\n\nWe'd love to hear what you think.\n\nSeven months after forking its code from the HashiCorp Terraform IT deployment\nsoftware, the Linux Foundation-backed OpenTofu has gotten legal pushback from\nHashiCorp.\n\nOn April 3, HashiCorp issued a strongly-worded Cease and Desist letter to\nOpenTofu, accusing that the project has \u201crepeatedly taken code HashiCorp\nprovided only under the Business Software License (BSL) and used it in a\nmanner that violates those license terms and HashiCorp\u2019s intellectual property\nrights.\u201d\n\nIt goes on to note that \u201cIn at least some instances, OpenTofu has incorrectly\nre-labeled HashiCorp\u2019s code to make it appear as if it was made available by\nHashiCorp originally under a different license.\u201d\n\nLast August, HashiCorp announced that it would be transitioning its software\nfrom the open source Mozilla Public License (MPL 2.0) to the Business Source\nLicense (BSL), a license that permits the source to be viewed, but not run in\nproduction environments without explicit approval by the license owner.\n\nHashiCorp gave OpenTofu until April 10 to remove any allegedly copied code\nfrom the OpenTofu repository, threatening litigation if the project fails to\ndo so.\n\n## OpenTofu\u2019s Refutation\n\nThe OpenTofu project team, however, has not backed down. In all public\ncommunication, it denies that any code was taken from the BSL-licensed version\nof Terraform and that any code copied came from the MPL-licensed version of\nTerraform.\n\n\u201cThe OpenTofu team vehemently disagrees with any suggestion that it\nmisappropriated, mis-sourced, or otherwise misused HashiCorp\u2019s BSL code. All\nsuch statements have zero basis in facts,\u201d the OpenTofu team responded on its\nwebsite.\n\nTRENDING STORIES\n\n  1. OpenTofu Project Denies HashiCorp's Allegations of Code Theft\n  2.
