PiEEG is versatile, easy to work with, and compatible with different\ntypes of electrodes. Best of all, it was designed to be usable by anyone. To\nbegin measuring bio-signals, all you need to do is connect the electrodes and\nrun a Python script. Applications include gaming, entertainment, sports,\nhealth, meditation, and more.\n\n  * PiEEG is not a medical device and has not been certified by any government regulatory agency for use with the human body.
