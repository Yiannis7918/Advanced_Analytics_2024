That means that a high percentage of its available capacity\nwas discharging when the record was set this week.\n\nAbout another 1.9 GW of battery storage capacity is in the process of\ncommissioning, and the CEC estimates that the stage needs about 52 GW of\nbattery storage to meet its 2045 goal of getting all of its power from carbon-\nfree sources. (It does not provide storage duration in those statistics).\n\n\u201cEnergy storage systems are a great example of how we can harness emerging\ntechnology to help create the equitable, reliable and affordable energy grid\nof the future,\u201d said CEC Vice Chair Siva Gunda in October last year.\n\nAustralia is experiencing a similar transition, although it has some way to go\nto catch up with the sheer scale of California. Australia, which commissioned\nwhat was then the world\u2019s first big battery at Hornsdale in late 2017, now has\njust over 2 GW (and an average of nearly two hours storage) of battery\ncapacity.\n\nBattery storage plays its biggest role in South Australia, which has a world-\nleading 75 per cent share of wind and solar in its grid. Battery storage is\nnow a feature of morning and evening peaks, and often accounts for well over\n10 per cent of supply, and has peaked in that state at 367 MW. And more big\nbatteries are on their way.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s grid has been setting numerous records in other ways in recent\nweeks, with renewables supplying 100 per cent of its electricity demand for\nbetween 15 minutes and six hours in 30 of the last 38 days. Just six days ago\nit reached a new record for utility scale solar output not 17.786 GW.\n\nGiles Parkinson\n\nGiles Parkinson is founder and editor of Renew Economy, and is also the\nfounder of One Step Off The Grid and founder/editor of the EV-focused The\nDriven.
