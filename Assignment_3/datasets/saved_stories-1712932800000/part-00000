Google appears to take\nsecurity seriously, as reflected in the features that have been launched to\nkeep users safe. However, there is only so much that can be done to deter\nhackers and prevent malware infections. To that extent, it can be beneficial\nto invest in security breach detection and management as well. Now, Google is\nrolling out a version of Chrome to address such concerns, specifically among\nbusiness customers.\n\nRelated\n\n##### 5 ways Google Chrome is becoming bloated\n\nGoogle's browser needs to drop some features, not get more\n\nGoogle has introduced a new edition of Chrome called Chrome Enterprise\nPremium, which has Core (free) and Premium (paid) options. The company is\npositioning the business-focused product as a browser that can give users more\ndata protection while online. This is achieved through means, such as\nautomatic updates to protect against newly emerged vulnerabilities, and\ncustomized site permissions across managed devices. This version of Chrome is\nalso crafted to block suspicious add-ons, for instance, to protect against\nhacking from all angles.\n\n## Key differences between paid vs. free Chrome Enterprise\n\nThere are business-specific benefits to subscribing to Chrome Enterprise as\nwell. For example, managers can limit documents that can be uploaded or\nprinted by other users to bolster security. Chrome Enterprise is also\ncompatible with other enterprise software, such as Google Workspace, for\nseamless integration. However, there are key differences between the paid and\nfree versions of Chrome Enterprise. The Premium edition (paid) comes with data\nloss prevention and malware deep scanning, for instance, while the Core one\n(free) does not. That being said, you can still access key benefits through\nthe Core version, such as general phishing and malware protection.\n\nDespite these enterprise-focused developments, Google hasn\u2019t forgotten about\nits standard Chrome users. Recently, the company began testing new security\nfeatures for the browser that limit website permissions. Specifically, users\nwill gain more control over which sites can access mouse and keyboard control,\nfor example. These might seem like minor improvements, but they can go a long\nway in terms of limiting bad actors\u2019 access to your sensitive information.\n\nReaders like you help support Android Police.
