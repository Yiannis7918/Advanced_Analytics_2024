Orlando was fired in March 2023, after that\ndeal was delayed, and replaced immediately by Eric Swider. That ouster is the\nfocus of the lawsuit, which was filed in March of this year by a company\nOrlando controls called Benessere Investment Group.\n\nIn its lawsuit, Benessere claims that Swider, who served as DWAC CEO from\nMarch 2023 to March 2024 and currently sits on Trump Media\u2019s board of\ndirectors, plotted a \u201ccoup d'\u00e9tat\u201d in order to oust Orlando as the CEO of\nDWAC. Benessere alleges that \u201cdefendants and other co-conspirators stole\naccess to Plaintiffs\u2019 computer systems and files and used the stolen\ninformation to attack Benessere and ARC II managing member, Patrick Orlando,\u201d\nas part of an \u201caudacious scheme to seize control of and enlarge their holdings\nin a publicly-traded company poised to merge with Trump Media & Technology\nGroup Corp.\u201d ARC II refers to ARC Global Investments II, a fund organized by\nOrlando which provided financing for the deal to take Truth Social public.\n\nThis lawsuit is the latest development in the legal acrimony among some\noriginal employees of the various companies associated with Truth Social, the\npeople who have managed to stick around, and former president Donald Trump\nhimself. Even before Trump\u2019s Truth Social officially launched in early 2022,\nDWAC was beset by investigative probes, insider trading, and petty infighting.\nThe company, which began trading publicly last month, is valued at more than\n$5 billion despite reporting just over $4 million in revenue in 2023. This\nwildly inflated valuation hangs over some of the recent lawsuits, as early\nemployees of the company stand to make millions of dollars if they manage to\nhold on to their shares.\n\nThe lawsuit claims that after Orlando\u2019s dismissal as CEO, Swider enlisted\nOrlando\u2019s former personal assistant, Alexander Cano, to improperly gain access\nto a protected electronic storage account at Box.com tied to Benessere and ARC\nII that held Orlando\u2019s confidential files, Mailchimp login information, and\nDocuSign accounts. Cano had access to the accounts in his capacity as\nOrlando\u2019s assistant and continued to have access despite no longer being\nOrlando\u2019s assistant or working at Benessere, the suit says.\n\n\u201cAt some point during 2023, months after Cano had left Benessere, Orlando\nlearned that he had been locked out of the Box Account and that Cano had\nseized total control of the Box Account as the administrator,\u201d the suit\nalleges. \u201cCano without authorization accessed files, including, without\nlimitation, files containing all information with regard to all investors as\nwell as all financial and other confidential information not only of ARC II\nbut also of Benessere.\u201d The suit alleged that Cano then gave the \u201cstolen\ninformation\u201d to Swider.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nBird Flu Is Spreading in Alarming New Ways\n\nDavid Cox\n\n  * Gear\n\nThe Best Record-Breaking Timepieces From the World's Biggest Watch Show\n\nJeremy White\n\n  * Science\n\nThis Woman Will Decide Which Babies Are Born\n\nJason Kehe\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Best Total Solar Eclipse Photos\n\nKaren Williams\n\nThen, according to the Florida suit, Swider used Orlando\u2019s stolen Mailchimp\naccount credentials and listserv to send an email to ARC II investors in the\nTruth Social deal on March 5, attacking Orlando\u2019s management of ARC II and\nDWAC, and his involvement in a separate lawsuit filed against DWAC the\nprevious month.\n\n\u201cMr. Orlando\u2019s leadership has guided our common interests with DWAC directly\ninto the arms of the SEC, the DOJ, lengthy delays and costly investigations,\u201d\nSwider wrote. \u201cBy filing this lawsuit against DWAC, Mr. Orlando is destroying\nthe value that may be realized upon consummation of the business combination\nby the Company and its members.\u201d\n\nSwider then invited fellow investors to join him on a series of Zoom calls to\n\u201cunderstand our risk exposure based on leadership that continues to march us\ndown a path of mis-information, hidden information, and self dealing.\u201d In the\nsame email cited in court documents, Swider added, \u201cI am not disparaging\nPatrick. I am sure he is an amazing Human being, Honest, hard working. Looking\nout for your best interest. He is good looking. He is cool. I like him.\nNothing in this email is meant to be defamatory. He has been great as a\nleader. Patrick- you are Awesome!!\u201d\n\nIn the Florida lawsuit, Benessere alleges that Swider tried to take control of\nthe two companies involved in funding the Truth Social Deal. \u201cAnd to gain\ncontrol of ARC II and complete his takeover of the entire DWAC enterprise,\nSwider sought to obtain confidential information about ARC II and its\ninvestors, which information was held by Benessere in a protected electronic\nstorage account at Box.com,\u201d the lawsuit alleges.\n\nBenessere says in its lawsuit that it has paid $6,000 to a computer forensics\nexpert to investigate the alleged hack, and that Swider and Cano haven\u2019t\nrelinquished access to the Box account.\n\nCano is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit. The suit claims that Swider\n\u201cpromised\u201d Cano the role of DWAC president and \u201coutsized\u201d compensation\nfollowing Cano\u2019s participation in accessing Orlando\u2019s Box account. Cano\neventually did become president of DWAC. When asked for comment, Cano referred\nWIRED to Eric Swider.\n\nIn an interview with WIRED, Swider denied all of the allegations in the\nlawsuit and said that publicly available documents filed with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission contradict many of its claims. Swider said that he\nnever hired Cano as his assistant and that Orlando had voted in favor of the\ncompensation that Cano received.\n\n\u201cI just think he's never let go [of] the fact that I replaced him,\u201d Swider\ntells WIRED. \u201cI don't know why it offends him so bad.\u201d\n\nBenessere Investment Group\u2019s lawsuit marks what appears to be a bitter falling\nout between Orlando and Swider, who were business partners for years. Swider\nwas formerly a director at Benessere, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nIn addition to this suit and Orlando's separate suit in Delaware, in which ARC\nII is contending that it should receive more stock as part of the Truth Social\ndeal, there are several other lawsuits associated with the nascent company.\nEarly Trump Media employees Wes Moss and Andy Litinsky recently sued the\ncompany in Delaware court, saying the company was diluting its shares. Shortly\nafter, Trump Media countersued Moss and Litinsky in Florida court, alleging\nthat their poor management delayed the deal.\n\nOrlando is also currently facing yet another lawsuit brought by DWAC. That\nsuit, which was filed in March, claims that Orlando intentionally delayed the\nTruth Social deal and, as a result, should have his shares reduced.\n\nBenessere Group and Orlando didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Swider,\nCano, and Renatus Advisors, Swider\u2019s advisory company that is also named as a\ndefendant, have yet to respond to the lawsuit in court.\n\n## You Might Also Like ...\n\n  * Navigate election season with our Politics Lab newsletter and podcast\n\n  * Think Google\u2019s \u201cIncognito mode\u201d protects your privacy?
