The legislation\nwas met with fierce opposition from Silicon Valley and online free speech\nadvocates, who argued that it would\u2019ve effectively promoted censorship,\nleading to a series of coordinated protests that included Wikipedia going dark\nand Google blacking out its logo. The proposed laws died soon after.\n\nStudios are again ramping up their war on piracy, this time attempting to\navoid the pitfalls in similar efforts more than a decade ago.\n\n### Related Stories\n\nBusiness\n\n### Disney, Universal Host Second Cohort of MPA-EICOP Entertainment Law and\nPolicy Fellowship (Exclusive)\n\nMovies\n\n### Pamela Corante Joins the Motion Picture Association's Communications Team\n\nMotion Picture Association chief executive Charles Rivkin on Tuesday announced\nat CinemaCon that the trade group representing the major studios will work\nwith members of Congress to enact legislation allowing companies across the\nmedia and entertainment industries to move for the blocking of access to\nwebsites that facilitate the sharing of pirated movies and TV shows.\n\n\u201cPiracy is clearly not a victimless crime,\u201d Rivkin said. \u201cAcross the globe, it\nundermines everyone who works in production \u2014 actors, directors, writers,\ncarpenters, craftspeople and more.\u201d\n\nThe announcement is part of a renewed bid to block websites accused of hosting\ncopyright-infringing content that enable piracy. Depending on how the\nlegislation is constructed, it also could allow bad actors to weaponize\ncopyright law in a way that stifles free speech across the internet.\n\n\u201cMeasures like this are inevitably used to censor lawful speech,\u201d says\nElectronic Frontier Foundation intellectual property litigation director Mitch\nStoltz. \u201cBecause they afford an easy way to make something disappear from the\ninternet, they\u2019re a magnet for abuse.\u201d\n\nIf the effort sounds familiar, Hollywood in 2011 backed legislation called the\nStop Online Piracy Act and the Protect Intellectual Property Act. Media and\nentertainment companies maintained that their only goal was to go after\nforeign websites that distribute unauthorized copies of content. Servers for\nThe Pirate Bay, for example, were located in Sweden, making it harder for U.S.\ncompanies to take action against the company. SOPA\u2019s intent was to cut off\nuser access to piracy sites by requiring providers to withhold services (think\nGoogle in search and PayPal in payment processing).\n\nLegislation has yet to be proposed but under MPA\u2019s vision, a process overseen\nby a federal judge will be created in which a copyright holder can move for an\norder to block a certain site, says MPA senior vp and associate general\ncounsel Ben Sheffner. If they disagree, internet service providers and members\nof the public will have a chance to respond. The burden will be on the\ncopyright owner to prove that the site is dedicated to infringement and\nenabling piracy, with the entire process taking place in a matter of months\nopposed to years if a studio were to initiate a lawsuit. If an order is\ngranted, it\u2019ll be left to the ISP or other intermediaries on how to deny\nconsumers access to the site.\n\nIn typical copyright litigation, a court first determines whether the\ndefendant has violated any of the plaintiff\u2019s rights. If there\u2019s liability, a\njudge then orders that the infringement cease. A case under this so-called\n\u201cno-fault regime\u201d would proceed differently, with the copyright holder not\nsuing or seeking damages in the traditional sense but rather solely seeking an\norder for intermediaries that connect the pirate site and users to halt the\ninfringement. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: This approach focuses only on sites featuring\nstolen materials,\u201d Rivkin said. \u201cThere are no gray areas here.\u201d\n\nAsked how the proposed law will be different from SOPA, Sheffner says that it\nwill be a \u201cmuch narrower piece of legislation.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, SOPA was criticized for forcing intermediaries into a role in which\nthey\u2019re making editorial decisions on content. Google, Reddit, AT&T, Cox and\nVerizon didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe MPA points to identical site-blocking legislation in other countries. Over\nthe past decade, more than 40 countries including the U.K., Canada and South\nKorea have enacted regimes that authorize courts or administrative agencies to\ndisable access to websites dedicated to piracy. Since then, more than 90,000\ndomains used by over 27,000 websites engaged in copyright infringement have\nbeen taken down, said MPA general counsel Karyn Temple in testimony before\nlegislators last year, noting that piracy cost the economy up to 560,000 jobs.\n\nShe added, \u201cThese laws work. They result in fewer visits to piracy sites. Even\nmore important, they result in more visits to legal sites. And none of the\npredictions about the purported ill effects of site blocking have come true.\nExamples of over-blocking \u2014 blocking of non-infringing content \u2014 have been\nrare to the point of nonexistence. Site blocking has not stifled free\nexpression.\u201d\n\nEnforcement mechanisms to take down copyrighted content on third-party\nplatforms are provided for in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Copyright\nholders can, for example, send YouTube a notice that a video is infringing on\ntheir intellectual property. YouTube, which is protected from liability as\nlong as it takes certain steps to remove the content, then notifies the user,\nwho can dispute the claim. The MPA is pushing further legislation because the\nDMCA is largely ineffective against foreign entities.\n\nActions taken under the DMCA may offer a window into how the law may be\nutilized, if it passes. In 2018, Sony sent Facebook a notice that musician\nJames Rhodes, who was performing a song by Bach, was infringing on its\ncopyright to the performance (Bach songs are in the public domain as long as\nit\u2019s an original performance). After Facebook muted the video, Rhodes disputed\nthe claim, explaining that \u201cthis is my own performance of Bach\u201d and that he\n\u201cowned all the rights.\u201d Sony rejected the reasoning. His video was only\nrestored after he took to Twitter and emailed executives at Sony. \u201cWhat about\nthe thousands of other musicians without that reach ...?\u201d he tweeted.\n\nThe MPA in 2023 also sent a takedown notice over an individual who made a\nplaylist of Pluto TV links allowing for other apps to play content \u2014 with the\nads \u2014 outside of its app, much in the same way a DVD can be played on any\nplayer. The group claimed the playlist, which gathered publicly available\ninformation in a single repository, was being used to \u201cengage in massive\ninfringement of copyrighted motion pictures and television shows.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny entity that wants information censored will want to use it,\u201d Stoltz says.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way to limit this [legislation] to piracy or egregious piracy or\nsome other formulation of narrow social harm.\u201d\n\nWhile acknowledging deficiencies with the DMCA, Stoltz stresses, \u201cThe way to\nreduce infringement is to provide content through lawful channels that are\nuser friendly and appropriately priced and that people want to use.\u201d\n\n## THR Newsletters\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\n\nSubscribe Sign Up\n\n## More from The Hollywood Reporter\n\n  * labor\n\n### Cond\u00e9 Nast Purgatory: Dozens of Staffers Marked for Layoffs Bide Time at\n\u201cCentral Editorial Group\u201d\n\n  * Super Mario Bros.\n\n### BAFTA Games Awards: \u2018Baldur\u2019s Gate 3,\u2019 \u2018Super Mario Bros.
