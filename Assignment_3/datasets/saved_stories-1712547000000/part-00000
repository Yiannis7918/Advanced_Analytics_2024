Boeing\nreferred BI to Southwest Airlines when reached for comment on Sunday.\n\nThe Alaska Airlines blowout in January has brought increased scrutiny around\nBoeing's quality control in the following months.\n\nFollowing the incident, the Federal Aviation Administration announced it would\ninvestigate Boeing's manufacturing process.\n\nThe FAA revealed in March that its probe found \"multiple instances where the\ncompanies allegedly failed to comply with manufacturing quality control\nrequirements.\" The agency also noted that it had found 27 areas in Boeing's\nsafety procedures that were insufficient.\n\nAfter the Alaska Airlines incident, several key executives, including Boeing\nCEO Dave Calhoun, announced that they would resign.\n\nIn a press release, the plane manufacturer also vowed to implement more\ninspections on the production line and change its quality practices.\n\nRead next\n\n### Watch: Thousands of bags pile up at US airports after flight cancellations\n\nTransportation Boeing Airlines\n\nMore...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecommended video\n\nFollow us on:\n\n  * * Copyright \u00a9 2024 Insider Inc.
