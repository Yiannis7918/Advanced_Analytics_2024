The ship was last seen by Shackleton's crew in 1915\nbefore it slipped under the icy surface. Falklands Maritime Heritage Trust and\nNational Geographic\n\nA team of researchers has discovered the wreck of Ernest Shackleton\u2019s\nEndurance vessel on the Antarctic sea floor. Carried out by the Endurance22\nExpedition and announced this week by the Falklands Maritime Heritage Trust,\nthe exciting discovery puts an end to a century-old maritime mystery.\n\nScientists used submersibles to capture images and video of the shipwreck,\nwhich is protected as a historic site and will remain undisturbed, Henry\nFountain reports for the New York Times. It rests 9,842 feet below the surface\nof the Weddell Sea, a pocket of the Southern Ocean east of the Antarctic\nPeninsula, reports Lilit Marcus for CNN.\n\n\u201cWe have made polar history with the discovery of Endurance, and successfully\ncompleted the world\u2019s most challenging shipwreck search,\u201d says expedition\nleader John Shears in a statement.\n\nEndurance immobilized in pack ice, as captured by crew photographer Frank\nHurley in 1915 Photo by Frank Hurley / Scott Polar Research Institute,\nUniversity of Cambridge / Getty Images\n\nEndurance was last seen in 1915, when Irish-British explorer Shackleton\n(1874-1922) and his 27 men watched in dismay as the ship sank into the icy\ndepths. The crew's mission, as members of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic\nExpedition, was a daring plan to reach the South Pole by traveling over the\nthen-unmapped terrain of the East Antarctic.\n\nCharismatic, reckless and obsessed with the South Pole, Shackleton was a major\nfigure in what came to be known as the heroic age of Antarctic exploration in\nthe early 20th century, \u201cwhich included treks by Norwegian Roald Amundsen, who\nin 1911 was the first to reach the pole, and by Robert Falcon Scott, a Briton\nwho died after reaching it a month later,\u201d per the Times. Shackleton and his\ncrew set off from South Georgia island in 1914 despite warnings from whalers\nthat the ice conditions in Weddell Sea were some of the \u201cworst in memory,\u201d per\nthe American Natural History Museum.\n\nAs spring arrived, ice began to crush the Endurance, damaging it beyond\nrepair. Photo by Frank Hurley / Scott Polar Research Institute, University of\nCambridge / Getty Images\n\nDisaster struck in 1915 when the ship became trapped in the pack ice. For ten\nmonths, the immobilized vessel floated along while crew members camped on ice\nfloes and waited for their surroundings to thaw. But as spring arrived in\nSeptember, the pressure of the shifting ice began to warp, crush and twist the\nboat\u2019s wooden frame.\n\nBy October, the ship had flooded beyond repair and all hopes of a return trip\nwere lost, as Kieran Mulvaney reports for History.com.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s going, boys,\u201d a crewmember reportedly cried in October as the hull was\nrent to pieces. \u201cIt\u2019s time to get off.\u201d The ship eventually slipped beneath\nthe surface on November 21,1915.\n\nShackleton\u2019s subsequent voyage to rescue his crew went down in history as one\nof the greatest examples of grit, leadership and luck in the annals of\nAntarctic expeditions. First, the crew survived a harrowing five days at sea\nto land three lifeboats at Elephant Island, where they set up a makeshift\ncamp. Shackleton and five others then navigated a treacherous 800-mile journey\non a small whaling boat to reach help on South Georgia island.\n\nThat open-sea journey, navigated by Capt. Frank Worsley, is considered \u201cone of\nthe epic small boat voyages ever undertaken across some of the steepest,\nharshest seas in the world,\u201d according to scholar Julian Dowdeswell. Thanks to\nShackleton\u2019s efforts and those of his crew, all 28 men survived and were\nrescued in 1917.\n\nResearchers searched for the Endurance on a South African polar research\nvessel, the S.A. Agulhas II. Falklands Maritime Heritage Trust / James Blake\n\nBiographers and historians have chronicled the details of the Endurance saga\nfor years. But the precise location of the wreck of the Endurance itself\nremained a mystery\u2014until now. With contemporary technology at their disposal\nand captain Worsley\u2019s notes in hand, Endurance22 set out in February to\ndiscover the site of the Endurance wreck.\n\nThe team traveled aboard the S.A. Agulhas II, a South African icebreaker and\npolar research vessel. The $10 million project was funded by an anonymous\nprivate individual, according to the Times.\n\nResearchers used two submersible crafts to scan the Antarctic sea floor for\nsigns of the shipwreck. Esther Horvath\n\nThey searched for two weeks, using two submersible crafts to scan the sea\nfloor in a 150-square-mile area. Researchers discovered the first signs of the\nshipwreck a few days ago, per the Times. The site where Endurance eventually\nsank turned out to be just four miles south of where Worsley, the ship\u2019s\ncaptain, had predicted it lay, per CNN.\n\nCold Antarctic temperatures have kept the 144-foot, three-masted wooden ship\nin stunning condition, scientists report. Images reveal that the bold capital\nletters of the ship\u2019s name are still intact and visible above the stern.\n\n\u201cWithout any exaggeration this is the finest wooden shipwreck I have ever\nseen\u2014by far,\u201d marine archaeologist and expedition director Mensun Bound tells\nBBC News\u2019 Jonathan Amos.\n\n\u201cIt is upright, well proud of the seabed, intact, and in a brilliant state of\npreservation,\u201d Bound adds. \u201cYou can see a porthole that is Shackleton's cabin.\nAt that moment, you really do feel the breath of the great man upon the back\nof your neck.\u201d\n\nResearchers used two submersible crafts to gather footage of Endurance without\ntouching or disturbing the historic wreck. Falklands Maritime Heritage Trust /\nEsther Horvath\n\nExperts flocked to Twitter to express congratulations and offer analyses.\nMarine biogeographer Huw Griffiths posted a crowdsourced thread where he\nidentified Antarctic deep-sea creatures visible in the photos of the wreck,\nincluding \u201chuge\u201d Antarctic sea anemones and sea squirts.\n\nDeep-sea polar biologist Michelle Taylor of Essex University tells BBC News\nthat the creatures, which include brittlestars and crinoids, are \u201call filter\nfeeding from the cool deep waters of the Weddell Sea.\u201d\n\nThe wreck is remarkably well-preserved, researchers report. Falklands Maritime\nHeritage Trust and National Geographic\n\nOthers described an ecstatic mood onboard when the team discovered the wreck.\n\u201cI got goose bumps,\u201d wrote Stefanie Arndt, a sea ice physicist who\nparticipated in the expedition, on Twitter. When the wreck was first spotted,\nshe was at work with fellow researchers on the ice nearby\u2014\u201cjust where\nShackleton\u2019s men have been.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe footage is breathtaking,\u201d Arndt added. \u201cI am overwhelmed.\u201d\n\nGet the latest stories in your inbox every weekday.\n\nNora McGreevy | | READ MORE\n\nNora McGreevy is a former daily correspondent for Smithsonian.
