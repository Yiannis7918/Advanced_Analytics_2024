The code exploits us\nas end-users, or rather our devices. But there's another more real and\nhorrible interpretation. Just as the food we eat comes at a huge human cost,\nthe digital services and devices we use every day also create human suffering.\nThe cost of our \"technological society\" is exploitation around the world, as\nchild labour, forced labour and lethal working conditions. As well as being\nmorally awful this has implications for sustainability and security.\n\n### Exploited tech creators\n\nSix years ago the press lit up with stories about how smartphones are made.\nLike earlier revelations about Nike trainers and other apparel made in\nsweatshops it was an already too familiar story of brutalised, over-worked and\nunder-paid child labour in factories around the world. In 2018 when the\nGuardian broke a story based on a book by Brian Merchant ^1 of suicidal young\nwomen throwing themselves from the roof of Chinese prison-factories, the\nresponse of the public was tepid.\n\nPeople simply could not process the idea that their precious iPhones were not\nactually made by Apple, by well fed white Americans in the green campuses of\nCupertino, but by thirteen year old's in dark, satanic Chinese factories. We\nsimply went into denial. In response the abusers had anti-suicide nets\ninstalled around the factory to scoop-up falling bodies and recycle them\nefficiently back onto the production line.\n\nThe factory bosses had journalists beaten up and, with the help of BigTech and\nmainstream media played the Western press with apologetic, disinformation and\nfake stories of happy workers.\n\nRegardless, poor working conditions in electronics manufacturing continues\ntoday in sites around the world that supply cheap labour in slack heath and\nsafety regimes. Workers suffer extreme pressure, physical brutality like\ncrippling working postures and no bathroom breaks, psychological abuse,\nhumiliation and exposure to mutagenic chemicals and radiation.\n\nAs well as the workers, we exploit resources to get our gadgets. In terms of\nenergy costs, by the time a tiny iPhone is created a quarter gigajoule of raw\nenergy is consumed; in silicon wafer processing, aluminium smelting, circuit\nboard manufacture and copper extraction. About 25kg of CO2 is produced and ten\nthousand litres of clean, filtered and processed cooling water is consumed -\nin a world where clean drinking water is in increasingly short supply.\n\n### Exploited e-waste workers\n\nIt is not only in the creation of digital goods that people are awfully\nexploited. Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) is a significant\nproblem too. Again it's effects fall mainly on young people in poor and\ndeveloping nations. A few years ago I talked with Gerry McGovern about world\nwide waste in an online interview. Millions are displaced or killed in the\nbattles for conflict minerals needed to make our gadgets.\n\nWhat I've gleaned from countless conversations with my father-in-law, a Nobel\nwinning biochemist from the Kyoto team, is that we mostly do not handle WEEE\nin the West. It is illegal to just bury it in landfills, although that happens\nand it leaches PFAS into the water-table for generations to come until it is\nexhumed.\n\nInstead, off it goes on the \"recycling boat\" to Africa, China or India. There,\nthe same shipping containers that brought nicely packaged electronic goods to\nus only 18 months earlier are filled with millions of tons techno-trash, IoT\ndevices, printers, smart-TVs, phones, tablets, cameras...\n\nIt's emptied into illegal open \"recycling\" sites, beside a river or lake,\nwhere child labourers smash it to pieces with hammers, Then they burn and wash\nthe fragments with acid in open pyres. The slurry, when crystallised, reclaims\na small percentage of valuable metals. But it also releases toxic heavy\nmetals, lead, mercury, cadmium, and hexavalent chromium that wash into the\nwater or leach from poor temporary storage.\n\nChild workers inhale a lethal mixture of particulate carcinogens, from both\nthe crushing and burning steps, while dioxins, phalates, and bromo-\nfluorocarbons belch into the atmosphere where, after falling as contaminated\nrain into the oceans, they will cause sterility, cancers and birth defects for\npotentially hundreds of years.\n\n### Exploited scammers\n\nWe all hate scammers right? When our phone rings from an unknown number to\ntell us we need to give our passwords for a bank transfer, or visit a site for\na \"Windows security update\", we wish they would just die, right? Well maybe\nthey will. What we rarely consider is that those people are also massively\nexploited. As Brian Krebs and Time have reported, human-trafficking-fuelled\ncyber fraud is a big thing. The scammers are themselves prisoners!\n\nImagine turning up to a tech interview for a dream job, only to find the door\nlocked behind you and a gun pointed in your face. Victims are selected for\nhaving no immediate family or contacts, and baited by fake adverts for\nlucrative jobs. Then they are kidnapped and trafficked by syndicates running\nscam centres. They have to con 20 or 30 people in rich Western countries every\nday to get food. That's why some get so angry and desperate.\n\n### Exploited service sector\n\nSimilarly, there are the people viciously exploited so that we can enjoy\nservices like Facebook. Moderators still view graphic content including gore,\nterrorism and child sexual abuse for eight to twelve hours a day. Some are\ndriven to extreme drug abuse and even suicide. Reporters like those from BBC\nhave to infiltrate the moderation centres or must talk to victims off-record\nas all are told they may not talk about their work and restrained by gagging\norders and threats.\n\nDespite record fines for mental illness suffered by workers, companies like\nFacebook continue to employ people for this. because the myth that \"AI can\nsolve it\" is a load of rubbish. Content moderation is just another of the\nmassive failures, tasks that AI it is supposed to solve but cannot.\n\nFake AI is the new scam. It turns out to be just a sweat-shop of underpaid,\nexploited humans. Amazon's \"just walk out\" grocery stores boasted AI\nmonitoring of your purchases. That turned out to be just thousands of mostly\nunderpaid women watching via remote cameras. The total number of people\nemployed per store was hundreds of times more than if the shops had used\nstaffed checkouts! And companies have been touting fake self-driving cars that\nare really just remote drivers in low wage \"operator\" jobs.\n\nIt turns out that the cost of \"AI\" is significantly higher than anticipated\nand the quality far, far lower than promised. Given the vast investment into\nit, there's enormous pressure to \"make it work at all costs\", which means it's\nbecome a driver for increased exploitation of low-wage humans. Humans are\nstill cheaper than AI, but only if that's kept a secret.\n\n### What does rampant exploitation mean for digital security?\n\nIn our last article we looked at the vulnerability of coders. Most free\nsoftware authors may not be living on the breadline in developing nations, but\nsome certainly are. As we saw in the xz backdoor incident one attack at the\nindividual level can lead to a compromise of nearly every device on the\nplanet. This time we got away with it, almost by pure luck.\n\nVulnerability of individuals means vulnerability of the whole system. Security\nis not only \"everyone's problem\" it's responsibility is distributed among all\nstakeholders of a technological society.\n\nAs I explored in living as a Digital Vegan we need to find a way towards\nGreener Gadgets, but also toward less exploitative technology. That is why the\ncurrent hyper-capitalist model is a security threat. It threatens the\nsustainability of technology for everyone, regardless the efficiency with\nwhich it produces goods, innovation and wealth.\n\nA single bug in a widely used IoT device could lead to the necessary forced\ndisposal of billions of devices. The impact of that on our environment would\nbe enormous. But our industry is already showing many signs of an addict,\nhiding things, lying to itself and living on borrowed time.\n\nAs with seafood production whose collapse Dana Meadows predicted in 1972, tech\ndoes not grow ex-nihilo from a magical Moore's Law, but must operate within a\ndynamic balance with resources, production, consumption, operation and\ndisposal. If our tech industry - a stack from the physical to the applications\nlayer which includes manufacture of chips, devices, software and services -\ncannot sustain itself without grotesque exploitation, then it is a tower of\ncards waiting to collapse.\n\nQuality costs. Ethically sourced code and equipment might be very much more\nexpensive than the mass-produced and mass-marketed products from BigTech.\nSilicon made in the UK or US costs more because wages and operating costs are\nhigher. Code written by well fed and rested engineers in stable and secure\nemployment, who work without anxiety, bullying and threats, and who feel good\nabout what they make, is of a better quality. It's been checked. It's been\ntested. Its creators care about it. And so it's more secure, in so many ways.\nSecurity is about not allowing a race to the bottom of exploitation.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 Cyber Show (C|S), 2023.
