It\u2019s existing, but it also highlights the\nfact that Google, and Android as a whole, have severely neglected UWB tech.\n\nUWB or, ultra wide-band, tech is not particularly new. It\u2019s used for very\nshort-range communication. On a large scale, that\u2019s useful for super high-\nspeed connectivity in smaller areas. But where the tech\u2019s limitations are\nhighlighted by that use case, the same weakness also makes UWB particularly\ngood at communicating with nearby devices in a way that lets you know how\nclose things are to one another.\n\nAs such, UWB is useful for things like digital car keys or \u201ctapping\u201d nearby\ndevices to interact with them. Android supports these kinds of uses, but it\nall depends on your device \u2013 this use of UWB requires additional hardware\noutside of cellular radios \u2013 as well as what the software can do.\n\nGoogle hasn\u2019t really done much with it.\n\nAs it stands today, there\u2019s essentially nothing you can do with UWB on, say,\nthe Pixel 8 Pro, which supports the tech. That\u2019s despite Google having stuffed\nthe hardware needed for this in the Pixel 6 Pro, 7 Pro, and Pixel Fold as\nwell. One of the very few places it\u2019s currently leveraged is in Quick Share.\n\nQuick Share uses UWB on some Android devices\n\nAnd that\u2019s not going to change with the Find My Device network either. While\nApple\u2019s AirTags have used UWB since day one to help users pinpoint the exact\nlocation of a lost item, none of the AirTag-like trackers that have been\nannounced for the Find My Device network actually support UWB. It\u2019s possible\nthat\u2019ll change in the future, but Google hasn\u2019t even mentioned UWB support for\nthis network yet, so it\u2019s hard to know what the company\u2019s plans are.\n\nThere are some developments on the horizon, though.\n\nGoogle has confirmed that the Pixel Tablet will soon support \u201cTap to Cast\u201d\nwith UWB-compatible Android phones starting this year, and it looks like Pixel\nWatch 3 will also support the technology for better unlocking of your phone\nwhen the two are nearby each other. Those are genuinely useful ways to show\noff and use the tech in a way that you actually notice.\n\n\u2018Tap to Cast\u2019 is coming to Pixel Tablet... at some point\n\nOf course, Google isn\u2019t the only one guilty here. Back in 2020, Samsung raved\nabout how UWB was going to be a big deal, but it hasn\u2019t gone very far in the\ntime since. The company still only equips its highest-end smartphones with the\ntech, as well as putting UWB in the Galaxy SmartTag 2 (which doesn\u2019t work with\nthe larger Android Find My Device network).\n\nWhat does the future hold with UWB on Android? I hope that UWB trackers are in\nthe future, but I really just want to see Google start using this tech, as it\nseems like the company is finally starting to do. UWB has tons of fun\napplications, many of which Apple is already using, but it\u2019s just been so\nsorely neglected.\n\n## More on Find My Device:\n\n  * You can use these trackers with both Android and Apple\u2019s finder networks\n  * What headphones will support Android\u2019s Find My Device network\n  * AirTag-like trackers for Android\u2019s Find My Device network will ship in May\n\nFollow Ben: Twitter/X, Threads, and Instagram\n\nAdd 9to5Google to your Google News feed.\n\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.
