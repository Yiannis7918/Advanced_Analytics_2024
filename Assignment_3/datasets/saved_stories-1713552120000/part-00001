I\u2019ve loved his work since we saw Memento in a tiny little theater on a\nwhim, and walked out with a different view of what a film could be. His work\nis smart, it\u2019s challenging, and it\u2019s gripping and engaging. Tenet seems to\nhave received a mixed reception. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s my favorite of his movies,\nbut it is certainly my favoritely crafted. It\u2019s not very easy to follow the\nactual story, but it dives headfirst into creating a mood. Again, it\u2019s unlike\nany other film I\u2019ve ever seen, with multiple layers of meta structure. There\nwere a lot of complaints about how the dialogue is inaudible over the blaring\nsoundtrack, but I found that everything that was important for the viewer to\nknow came through clearly enough, and the sound design itself was amazingly\nimmersive and worked as a powerful element of the film\u2019s environment. The\naction scenes were fresh and intense, the humor is tight and subtly delivered,\nand the storytelling aims high and almost entirely hits its target.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t seen it, my recommendation is to watch it once, think about it\nfor a little while, and then watch it again.
