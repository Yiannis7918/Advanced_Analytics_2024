With an adapter cartridge that spies on the memory bus!\n\nLet's talk about how to reconstruct the Game Boy's memory state, emulate its\ngraphics unit and then encode the image into an MJPEG stream for anyone to use\nas a USB video class device. In realtime. On an rp2040 microcontroller.\n\nThe original goal of the open source project \"GB Interceptor\" was to capture\ngameplay for one specific game: Tetris. In order to live stream a Tetris\ntournaments from the contestant's personal Game Boys, the idea was to create\nan adapter that goes between the Game Boy and the game module to analyze the\ncommunication on the memory bus and reconstruct the game state.\n\nIt turns out that it is actually possible to reconstruct the entire memory\nstate of almost any game and in fact create an rp2040-based adapter that acts\nas a USB video class device offering the on-screen game footage in realtime.\nPlayers can simply put this adapter into their Game Boy and use it like a\nwebcam without additional drivers or knowledge.\n\nAn essential aspect of this concept is that the Game Boy basically runs all of\nits code directly from the ROM module, which makes it possible to directly\nfollow the program counter of its 8bit CPU regardless of how the code\nbranches. An image can then be recreated by emulating the graphics unit (PPU).\n\nHowever, there are many edge cases like interrupts, data from registers that\nare not visible on the bus, the link cable, DMA operations, synchronization of\nCPU and PPU, game bugs and even bugs in the Game Boy hardware itself.\n\nIn this talk I will show how all this is done just on an rp2040 with spare\ncycles to encode everything as a 60fps MJPEG stream. I will shine a light on\nthe edge cases - those that were solved and those that might just be\nunsolvable with this approach. And I will take you on a sightseeing tour\nthrough the 8bit hell that drives our iconic handheld from 1989.\n\n### Download\n\n#### Video\n\n  * MP4\n  * WebM\n\nDownload 1080p\n\neng-deu-fra 578 MB\n\nDownload 576p\n\neng-deu-fra 271 MB\n\nDownload 1080p\n\neng-deu-fra 568 MB\n\nDownload 576p\n\neng-deu-fra 272 MB\n\n#### These files contain multiple languages.\n\nThis Talk was translated into multiple languages.
