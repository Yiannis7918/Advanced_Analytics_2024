It\u2019s a dark brown, almost black, shiny paste with a\npungent scent, and a very strong, almost indescribable taste that is strongly\numami and very salty.\n\nIt is a little like soy sauce in solid form.\n\nWe tend to eat it on toast for breakfast. The trick is not to spread it\nthickly like peanut butter; instead, you take about a quarter of a teaspoon\u2019s\nworth and scrape it thinly over the entire slice. It also goes very nicely in\na toasted cheese sandwich.\n\nIt sounds unique, but perhaps the strangest thing about it is that it is not:\nthe British have Marmite, which tastes similar but is runnier, Australians\nhave a second yeast extract spread called Promite, In my personal opinion,\neven better than Vegemite. the Germans and Swiss have Cenovits and Vitam-R, I\nhaven\u2019t tried either of these. and a Latvian friend once gave me a jar of a\ntan-coloured, honey-consistency thick liquid he told me was like Vegemite and\nI (sadly) found inedible.\n\nThis leads to spirited debates about which is best and, like a true\nAustralian, I mock Marmite to the British friend with whom I made Vegemite for\nthis article, Marmite is the inferior product: it is not a solid paste but is\nrunny, and has a slightly less strong taste. even as he keeps Marmite in his\ncupboard and would never touch Vegemite. Both of us quietly admit they\u2019re very\nsimilar and I have many times bought Marmite when Vegemite was not available.\nWhen you live overseas, you make do with what you can get. In Australia, you\u2019d\nnever admit to eating Marmite. But among fraternity of overseas Aussie\ncitizens, there\u2019s an unspoken knowledge that we\u2019ve all lowered ourselves to\nMarmite from time to time.\n\nBut even if thick black pungent salted umami spreads are common, how are they\nmade? And what is such a strange spread really made of?\n\nThe jar claims to be a \u2018yeast extract\u2019, and Aussie rumour had it that it was\nmade from leftovers from making beer. Very Australian. Since it was invented\nin the 1920s, I personally had a mental image of a specific strain of yeast\nfermenting to produce some precursor substance, Asimov-style.\n\nThen my Marmite-loving British friend sent me this video, From the How To Cook\nThat Youtube channel by Ann Reardon. and one afternoon we made it. By \u2018we made\nit\u2019, it\u2019s more that I\u2019d casually mentioned I\u2019d like to try, and then at the\npub the previous evening he said he had all the ingredients and would I like\nto join him the next afternoon? In other words: his effort, his ingredients,\nhis kitchen, and I took photos.\n\nLeft to right: Marmite, our spread, our Czech friend's umami stock spread, and\nsome nutritional yeast paste to round out the last slice.\n\n## Ingredients\n\nA homebrewing friend provided:\n\n  * The yeast slurry from the bottom of a batch of beer (from a plain lager)\n  * A fermented malt wort made from dry malt mixed with water\n\nThe malt was very liquid and we boiled it down to a thick syrup. You could\nlikely use supermarket malt.\n\nBoiling the skimmed yeast slurry liquid.\n\nThe yeast slurry in Ann Reardon\u2019s video was separated into yeast and liquids\nvia a home-made washing-machine centrifuge. But our slurry had been sitting in\nmy friend\u2019s fridge for a few days, and he simply poured off the top. This\nliquid, a pale clear tan, we boiled down into a thick, dark brown syrup too.\nInitially, the kitchen smelled like hot beer, but it soon changed to smell\nlike something recognisable as a Vegemite-like scent. It was not unpleasant\u2014if\nyou like Vegemite\u2014but it was strong, and at some point despite the winter\noutside every window in the apartment was opened.\n\nLeft: the malt reducing to a syrup; right: the slurry liquid also being boiled\ndown.\n\nA good half-liter or more of yeast-slurry-liquid turned into only a couple of\ntablespoons of dense brown syrup. This is definitely a recipe where large\nstarting volumes are needed, and you won\u2019t get a large quantity result.\n\nThe resulting two syrups: on the left, heavily reduced malt wort to a very\ndark, sweet, flavourful syrup; on the right, the main Vegemite flavour comes\nfrom the boiled-down reduction from the yeast slurry. A good cooking blog\nwould show these two dishes very clean, with no drip remnants, but all this\nstuff is thick, sticky, and messy.\n\nThe final major ingredient is nutritional yeast. We mixed several tablespoons\nwith warm water to make a light yellow sludge. The names for the\ningredients\u2014slurries, sludges\u2014are as appetizing as many non-Australians claim\nVegemite to be.\n\n### Taste Testing\n\nA taste test gave:\n\n  * Boiled slurry liquid: Vegemite or Marmite overtones, but surprisingly bitter (perhaps the result of hops?)\n  * Boiled, thick malt: unexpectedly, a strong \u2018this taste is not Vegemite but is in Vegemite\u2019 response. Vegemite does not taste like malt, and you would never eat Vegemite and think of malt, yet boiled-down malt wort syrup distinctly resembles very sweet Vegemite.\n\n## Mixing\n\nAdding malt to the boiled-down slurry liquid, and then adding salt and the\nnutritional yeast sludge.\n\nDrag \u21e2\n\nThe Youtube video has no proportions, and even with large quantities of\nstarting liquids we had only teaspoons of boiled-down results. Taking the\nentire boiled-down yeast slurry runoff liquid, perhaps three teaspoons or a\nlittle more, we added about half a teaspoon of malt, a generous dash of salt\nVegemite is very salty. and about a teaspoon of nutritional yeast sludge. Some\nvigorous mixing, some adjustment (a tiny bit more malt, plus a bit more salt)\nVegemite is very salty. and we deemed it done.\n\nThe appetizingly-coloured result!\n\nIt was not the right colour. Nor did it taste exactly like Vegemite, though it\nwas very close. But the taste was exactly like Marmite!\n\n## Taste Tests\n\nBritish friend:\n\n> Bang on. Yeah. Feels like you should make it with beer that\u2019s not very\n> hoppy.\n\nFriend\u2019s partner:\n\n> Really really close. A little more bitter maybe.\n\nMy partner:\n\n> It\u2019s softer, and more bitter, than Marmite. Marmite is very sticky, and this\n> lacks the stickiness of Marmite. But it still tastes like Marmite.\n\nTo me: There was a strong hit of salt and then it fades into distinct Marmite\nflavour. Then a slight unwanted bitter note. The aftertaste is just like\nVegemite. The next day, cold from the fridge, it seemed more sharp in flavour\nthan the previous day. Overall, very in the Vegemite/Marmite family.\n\n# Variations\n\nIn the same taste-test, we also tried a variant made by our Czech friend who\nsupplied the beer slurry. He was not interested in recreating Vegemite per se,\nbut in creating an umami stock he could use for cooking. So he\u2019d boiled it\ndown with stock cubes and a lot more malt: the colour was right (very dark due\nto the malt) but it was sweet and very much not Vegemite.\n\nFor ours, the main consensus is that there is a hint more bitterness in our\nMite than in Vegemite. This may be due to the beer that provided the slurry:\nit came from a well-hopped lager. Perhaps we need to add more malt to offset\nthe bitterness; it\u2019s a strong flavour though and risks overpowering the key\nVegemite notes that come from the boiled-down beer slurry. I\u2019d like to try\nagain using slurry from making a stout or one of the sweeter porters, which\nmay have fewer hops, a darker colour from the roasted grains, and could give a\nless bitter starting point.\n\nThe majority of Australian beer is lager, and if Vegemite uses the most widely\navailable beer remnants, it likely comes from some kind of light, hopped beer.\nI am curious how they get such a dark colour.\n\nFinally, Wikipedia claims Vegemite is made with celery and onion extracts. I\u2019d\nlike to try again using a stout/sweet porter as basis, and add celery salt and\nonion powder.\n\n# Making Vegemite\n\nWhat did I get for an afternoon\u2019s worth of watching beery liquids boil down in\nmy friend\u2019s kitchen? I came home with three quarters of a teaspoon of brown\nrunny goop... and somewhat of a fascination for how people invented this stuff\nin the first place.\n\nLeft to right: Marmite, our spread, our Czech friend\u2019s umami stock spread, and\nsome nutritional yeast paste to round out the last slice of toast.\n\nCopyright 2022 and later; see About for more details.
