Lawmakers visit Amazon facilities across Europe after parliament\nban\n\nMEP Agnes Jongerius is among the lawmakers that will visit an Amazon facility.\n- Copyright Mathieu CUGNOT/ European Union 2022 - Source : EP\n\nBy Cynthia Kroet\n\nPublished on 12/04/2024 - 07:52\n\nShare this article Comments\n\nShare this article\n\nFacebook Twitter Flipboard Send Reddit Messenger Linkedin VK\n\nThe visits aim to give an insight into working conditions.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFive social-democrat lawmakers will visit Amazon facilities in Germany, Italy,\nSpain and the Netherlands today (12 April), after representatives from the\ne-commerce platform were banned from entering the European Parliament\nfollowing several no-shows at planned hearings.\n\nDuring the visits, conducted together with trade union representatives, the\nlawmakers will want to hear more about working conditions from employees, a\npress statement by union UNI Europa, which coordinated the visits, said.\n\nThe Socialist and Democrats (S&D) employment and social affairs spokesperson\nAgnes Jongerius (the Netherlands) will go to Almelo, vice-presidents Gaby\nBischoff and Marc Angel (both Germany) to Frankfurt, Iban Garc\u00eda del Blanco\n(Spain) to Madrid, and Brando Benifei (Italy) to Milan.\n\nJongerius said in a statement that Amazon needs to \u201cfully respect workers\u2019\nrights\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe demand Amazon to stop exploiting workers and bogus self-employed, in\nparticular to stop using massive surveillance and AI to abuse employees and\ninvade their privacy,\u201d she added.\n\n## Workplace\n\nThe move comes after 14 Amazon lobbyists were banned from entering the\nparliament in February following a call from the Employment and Social Affairs\nCommittee (EMPL) after the company failed to attend a series of hearings and\nfactory visits in 2021 and 2023.\n\n\u201cIt is unreasonable for members to be lobbied by Amazon while at the same time\nbeing deprived of the right to represent the interests of European citizens\nand inquire about claims of breaches of fundamental rights enshrined in EU\nTreaties and EU labour laws,\u201d the employment committee said.\n\nThe politicians wanted to hold discussions and visits to verify media reports\nsuggesting the potential monitoring of Amazon's workers along with other\nbusiness and workplace practices.\n\nFollowing the parliament ban, Amazon said it was willing to keep engaging with\nlawmakers. \"We have on several occasions invited them to visit our facilities.\nThat invitation still stands,\" a spokesperson said in February.\n\nIn January, the tech giant was fined \u20ac32m by France's data protection\nauthority CNIL after it found that Amazon France Logistique, which manages the\ncompany's warehouses in France, set up \"an excessively intrusive system for\nmonitoring the activity and performance of employees.\" The penalty followed an\ninquiry set up in 2019 after a complaint from workers. Amazon France\nLogistique employs around 20,000 staff in France.\n\nSome 21 trade organisations, including UniEuropa, IndustriAll European Trade\nUnion and LobbyControl, last month also called for a ban on all lobbying\norganisations working for Amazon \u201c to give real effect\u201d to the decision to\nwithdraw access badges from Amazon staff.

Educational level also\nvaries with age and gender.\n\nWhich countries have the highest rate of higher education in Europe? How do\neducational levels vary across Europe? Which countries pay more attention to\nvocational education? Euronews Next crunches the data.\n\n  * Oxford crowned the best in the Times' World University 2024 rankings. Where else made the grade?\n\n## How are educational levels defined?\n\nEducational levels are defined as low (less than high school), middle (high\nschool), or high (university studies).\n\nEuropean data agency Eurostat\u2019s classification is based upon the International\nstandard classification of education (ISCED), and refers to:\n\n\u25cf Low: pre-primary, primary and lower secondary education (ISCED levels 0\u20132);\n\n\u25cf Medium: upper secondary and post-secondary non-tertiary education (ISCED\nlevels 3 and 4);\n\n\u25cf High: tertiary education (ISCED levels 5\u20138). It includes public and private\nuniversities, colleges, technical training institutes, and vocational schools.\n\nIn 2022, 31.8 per cent of people aged 25-74 years in the EU had a higher\neducational attainment, ranging from 17.4 per cent in Romania to 49.8 per cent\nin Ireland.\n\n  * Which university degree will earn you the most money? These are the highest paying\n\n## Nordic and Baltic countries have more graduates than EU average\n\nShares of higher education graduates were higher than the EU average in the\nNordic and Baltic countries. Sweden and Norway ranked third and fourth with\nover 45 per cent of tertiary education graduates.\n\nOf the Latvian population, 44 per cent had a higher education degree. Other\nNordic and Baltic countries also had higher shares than the EU average in\ntertiary graduates.\n\nIn the UK, 43.5 per cent of the population aged 25-74 had a higher education,\nwhich was over the EU's \u2018Big Four\u2019 countries. France (38.2 per cent) had the\nhighest share among them, followed by Spain (38 per cent).\n\nAfter Romania, Italy had the lowest share of tertiary graduates at 18.5 per\ncent. This figure was also slightly below the EU average in Germany (31.5 per\ncent).\n\n## Population with lower education was above 40 per cent in four EU countries\n\nThe share of the population with higher education was significantly lower in\nthe EU candidate countries.\n\nTurkey had the highest share of the population with low education by far where\ntwo-thirds (61.8 per cent) had less than upper secondary education attainment.\n\nThis figure was also below 40 per cent in four EU countries, namely Portugal,\nItaly, Malta and Spain.\n\n  * Oxford topped the World University Rankings 2023. Where else in Europe made the cut?\n\n## Vocational orientation plays significant role in several countries\n\nLooking at the details of medium educational attainment, consisting of general\nand vocational orientation, the share of vocational education is considerably\nhigh in several countries.\n\nThe share of people with vocational orientation at a medium education level\nwas above 45 per cent in nine EU countries including Czechia (63.9), Poland\n(52.2), and Germany (47.4).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n## Younger people attain higher levels of education\n\nThe share of tertiary education graduates significantly increases among the\nyounger population across Europe.\n\nThis also indicates how the countries have been doing in recent decades. Thus,\nthe level of population aged 25\u201334 years is largely analysed by international\ninstitutions.\n\n## More than two-fifths of EU population has tertiary education\n\nIn 2022, 42 per cent of the EU population aged 25\u201334 had a higher education\ndegree. It varied 24.7 per cent in Romania to 62.3 per cent in Ireland.\n\nContrary to the population aged 25-74, Nordic countries Finland and Iceland\nhad a lower share of tertiary education than the EU average.\n\nThis figure was above 50 per cent in one-third of EU countries. Ten EU\ncountries were also behind the EU\u2019s 45 per cent target by 2030.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n  * Gender pay gap: This is the only country in Europe that pays women more than men\n\n## Women are more educated than men\n\nIn 35 European countries where data is available, women aged 25\u201334 had a\nhigher proportion of tertiary education attainment than men.\n\nIn 2022, on the average, the proportion of women with tertiary education was\n47.6 per cent whereas it was 36.5 per cent for men.\n\nExcept for Finland, the gender gap was significantly higher in Nordic and\nBaltic countries in favour of women. Iceland (25.4 percentage points, or pp),\nSlovenia (23.8 pp), and Slovakia (22.8 pp) recorded the highest difference.\n\nTurkey (1.3 pp), Switzerland (3.6 pp), and Germany (4.6 pp) reported the\nsmallest gap, showing the shares of women and men with a higher education\ndegree are so close.\n\n## Proportion of population with higher education is growing\n\nIn the EU, the share of people aged 25-74 years with tertiary education has\nbeen constantly developing. It increased from 19.1 per cent in 2004 to 31.8\nper cent in 2022.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n## Lifelong learning: Adults in education\n\nLifelong learning is also significant as people may need to update their\nskills. It is also called adult learning which is the participation in\neducation and training for adults.\n\nAccording to Eurostat, it includes all purposeful learning activities, whether\nit is formal, non-formal, or informal.\n\nThe aim is to improve knowledge, skills, and competences among the\nparticipants. Adult learning is an important aspect when it comes to the\ndigitalisation and automation in the labour market.\n\nIn 2022, the share of people aged 25 to 64 years in the EU who had\nparticipated in education or training in the previous 4 weeks was 11.9 per\ncent, ranging from 1.7 per cent in Bulgaria and 36.2 per cent in Sweden.\n\nWhile the proportion of adult learning was high in Nordic countries, the\nBalkan countries had significantly lower shares compared to the EU average.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nShare this article Comments\n\n## You might also like\n\nNow playing Next\n\nTech News\n\n### How do people feel about robots in most G7 countries?
