While I do not expect everyone to take\neven a passing interest in the rabbit-hole of the situation or the context, I\nfigured it was worth writing a few quick addendums.\n\nNaturally, as is the case when you post anything anywhere in public, I am\ncalled a liar. I\u2019ll simply say that everything I describe in the blog entry\nhappened. I contacted a VCF administrator and was told it was all disposed of,\nand that they kept the bins. I am fine with people claiming that disposal was\nnot what happened, but this is what I was told, directly, in human words. The\nfact that I am seeing contradictory and confusing descriptions of what\nhappened is not a checkmark destined for the Win column.\n\nA few people have rushed to indicate that I need to be more careful describing\n\u201cwhich\u201d VCF entity is at fault. I am sad to report to them all that the\nByzantine VCF structure of name licensing, geographic branding, and internal\ncorporate entity is meaningless to anyone six inches away. You all know each\nother and you all interchangeably use nomenclature. If you are part of an\norganization that calls itself some form of \u201cVCF\u201d and need an opportunity to\nwrite a statement about how your organization in a solitary/separate entity\nand should be considered more worthy or ethical than others, feel absolutely\nfree.\n\nA small sliver of people were concerned I was saying that I was never going to\ngo to any computer history conference or event again. I am a free person with\nthe freedom to attend whatever is open to the public. As it stood, however,\nVCF East was the easiest event for me to attend, so it was where I saw people\nthe most. A minor point is that I considered attendance a form of endorsement,\nbut that is my own personal choice. The chances of me attending other events\nis, like death by cow, low but never zero.\n\nThe rest of the discussions I have seen from the blog entry, raging in the\nusual stages of social media and posting forums, have failed to require any\nfurther response or thought from me personally.\n\nFinally, this is all relatively minor in terms of the work I do and projects I\nfocus on, an event that brought me some fury but which has mostly played the\npart of filed under \u201clife lessons\u201d. I just got tired of having quiet inward\nemotion when I was reminded of the event, specifically when VCF announcements\nwould pass by my screen, followed by nice folks asking if they would be seeing\nme at the event. Now I have made a statement, and rather than the beginning of\na saga, I consider it the end of one. My conversations with people and\norganizations I shift materials to are much longer, much more involved, and\nwith much more contingencies as a result of this event, and things are better\nfor it.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Share\n\n  * Email\n  * Facebook\n  * Reddit\n  * Twitter\n\nCategorised as: Uncategorized\n\n### Leave a ReplyCancel reply\n\n\u00a9 2024 ASCII by Jason Scott | powered by WordPress Entries (RSS) and Comments (RSS).\n\nLoading Comments...\n\n", "frontpage": true}
