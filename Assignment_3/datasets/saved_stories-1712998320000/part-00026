The contract\nshows Google billing the Israeli Ministry of Defense over $1 million for the\nconsulting service.\n\nThe version of the contract viewed by TIME was not signed by Google or the\nMinistry of Defense. But a March 27 comment on the document, by a Google\nemployee requesting an executable copy of the contract, said the signatures\nwould be \u201ccompleted offline as it\u2019s an Israel/Nimbus deal.\u201d Google also gave\nthe ministry a 15% discount on the original price of consulting fees as a\nresult of the \u201cNimbus framework,\u201d the document says.\n\nProject Nimbus is a controversial $1.2 billion cloud computing and AI\nagreement between the Israeli government and two tech companies: Google and\nAmazon. Reports in the Israeli press have previously indicated that Google and\nAmazon are contractually barred from preventing specific arms of the Israeli\nstate using their technology under Project Nimbus. But this is the first time\nthe existence of a contract showing that the Israeli Ministry of Defense is a\nGoogle Cloud customer has been made public.\n\nGoogle recently described its work for the Israeli government as largely for\ncivilian purposes. \u201cWe have been very clear that the Nimbus contract is for\nworkloads running on our commercial platform by Israeli government ministries\nsuch as finance, healthcare, transportation, and education,\u201d a Google\nspokesperson told TIME for a story published on April 8. \u201cOur work is not\ndirected at highly sensitive or classified military workloads relevant to\nweapons or intelligence services.\u201d\n\nContacted on April 10 with questions about the Ministry of Defense contract, a\nGoogle spokesperson declined to comment further.\n\nRead More: Exclusive: Google Workers Revolt Over $1.2 Billion Contract With\nIsrael\n\nThe news comes after recent reports in the Israeli media have alleged the\ncountry\u2019s military, controlled by the Ministry of Defense, is using an AI-\npowered system to select targets for air-strikes on Gaza. Such an AI system\nwould likely require cloud computing infrastructure to function. The Google\ncontract seen by TIME does not specify for what military applications, if any,\nthe Ministry of Defense uses Google Cloud, and there is no evidence Google\nCloud technology is being used for targeting purposes. But Google employees\nwho spoke with TIME said the company has little ability to monitor what\ncustomers, especially sovereign nations like Israel, are doing on its cloud\ninfrastructure.\n\nThe Israeli Ministry of Defense did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Israeli Ministry of Defense\u2019s attempt to onboard more units to Google\nCloud is described in the contract as \u201cphase 2\u201d of a wider project to build\nout the ministry\u2019s cloud architecture.\n\nThe document does not explicitly describe phase one, but does refer to earlier\nwork carried out by Google on behalf of the ministry. The ministry, the\ncontract says, \u201chas [already] established a Google Cloud Landing Zone\ninfrastructure as part of their overall cloud strategy and to enable [the\nMinistry of Defense] to move applications to Google Cloud Platform.\u201d\n\nFor \u201cphase 2\u201d of the project, the contract says, the Ministry of Defense \u201cis\nlooking to enable its Landing Zone to serve multiple units and sub-units.\nTherefore, [the Ministry of Defense] would like to create several different\nautomation modules within their Landing Zone based on Google\u2019s leading\npractices for the benefit of different units, with proper processes to\nsupport, and to implement leading practices for security and governance\narchitecture using Google tools.\u201d\n\nThe consulting services on offer by Google are for the tech company to \u201cassist\nwith architecture design, implementation guidance, and automation\u201d for the\nMinistry of Defense\u2019s Google Cloud landing zone, the contract says. The\nestimated start date is April 14, and Google\u2019s consulting services are\nexpected to take one calendar year to complete.\n\nTwo Google workers have resigned in the last month in protest against Project\nNimbus, TIME previously reported.\n\n## More Must-Reads From TIME\n\n  * Exclusive: Google Workers Revolt Over $1.2 Billion Contract With Israel\n  * Jane Fonda Champions Climate Action for Every Generation\n  * Stop Looking for Your Forever Home\n  * The Sympathizer Counters 50 Years of Hollywood Vietnam War Narratives\n  * The Bliss of Seeing the Eclipse From Cleveland\n  * Hormonal Birth Control Doesn\u2019t Deserve Its Bad Reputation\n  * The Best TV Shows to Watch on Peacock\n  * Want Weekly Recs on What to Watch, Read, and More?
