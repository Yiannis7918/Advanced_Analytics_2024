Even more challenging\ncan be figuring out which of these APIs are not actively managed \u201cshadow\nAPIs\u201d. Born from well-intended development initiatives and legacy systems,\nshadow APIs operate without proper oversight or governance, and could be the\nsource of damaging security incidents.\n\nToday at Google Cloud Next, we are excited to announce shadow API detection in\npreview in Advanced API Security, part of our Apigee API Management solution.\n\n### Securing your APIs with Apigee API Management\n\nApigee is Google Cloud\u2019s turnkey API management solution that can help you\nbuild, manage, and secure APIs in the cloud and on-premises. Apigee helps\nensure the reliability of your API transactions with fine-grained controls and\nmore than 50 built-in security policies, including authentication and\nauthorization.\n\nAdvanced API Security works proactively to identify misconfigured APIs, detect\nmalicious bot and business logic attacks, and helps organizations take swift\naction to mitigate threats. Previously, this protection was only available for\nactively-managed APIs. Now, with the ability to discover shadow APIs in\nAdvanced API Security, you can eliminate hard-to-find blind spots and close\nsecurity gaps.\n\n### Detecting shadow APIs in Advanced API Security\n\nAdvanced API Security now integrates with Google Cloud regional external\nApplication Load Balancers to discover and identify API traffic in a specific\nregion, to help support regulatory and performance requirements.\n\nIn the following example, we show how this works in our Belgium region\n(europe-west-1).\n\nSelect your Google Cloud external Application Load Balancer\u2019s region to\ndiscover the associated APIs.\n\nThrough examination of requests and responses flowing through your load\nbalancers, Advanced API Security extracts the APIs and their relevant details\nsuch as API endpoints, platform, protocol, parameter names, and responses. You\ncan access critical details on where the API is operating, the kind of\noperations that are running, and the latest activity on these APIs via an\nintuitive interface.\n\nAdvanced API Security catalogs and organizes all the APIs linked to the\nselected load balancer\n\nShadow API detection also looks at historical data to uncover new API calls,\nand can provide always-on awareness and detection of emerging shadow APIs. You\ncan tag individual endpoints that need further attention to ensure\ncomprehensive protection across your API surface.\n\nDetailed information on shadow API endpoints associated with your load\nbalancer\n\nUpon detecting shadow APIs, you can collaborate with the API owners to\nestablish management in accordance with company-wide security and API\nmanagement standards. You can also implement missing security measures to help\nreduce the risk of compromise.\n\n### Get started tracking down shadow APIs\n\nBy detecting shadow APIs, Advanced API Security can help you strengthen your\nsecurity posture and adopt a more proactive approach to finding\nvulnerabilities lurking in your application infrastructure.
