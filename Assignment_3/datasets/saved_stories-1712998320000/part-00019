Young single men living at home and\nplaying video games are behind a \u201ccrisis of the American male,\u201d she explained\nin an interview with Fortune.\n\nHer theory about dateless, spiraling young men ends with home prices declining\nfor years, or even decades. Whitney sees home prices falling 30%, but it\u2019s\n\u201cnot the end of the world,\u201d in her mind because of how much prices went up\nduring the pandemic-fueled housing boom. \u201cThere\u2019s so much equity stored up in\nAmerican homes, there\u2019s no collateral damage from that\u2014people then, on paper,\nare worth less than they thought they were,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cIt sounds\ndramatic, but it\u2019s really not that dramatic just because you\u2019ve had so much\nmassive inflation from the zero interest rate policy.\u201d\n\nAs of last year, almost 40% of American homeowners were mortgage-free, meaning\nthey owned their home outright. Although they\u2019d probably be upset to see their\nnet worth fall that much. On the other hand, those who missed the mark and\ndidn\u2019t buy a home before the run-up in prices during the pandemic, might be\nhappy. But let\u2019s go back to the premise: young men (who are actually only part\nof the equation, and something she\u2019s discussed before).\n\nA lot of young men are single, a study from the Pew Research Center found last\nyear. More than 60% of men under 30 described themselves as unattached in a\nsurvey conducted by the Pew Research Center; Whitney referred to this analysis\nin her thinking. The aforementioned study also found the share of single men\nin the country looking to date or be in a relationship has declined since\n2019, which Whitney alluded to, and emphasized that a portion of young, single\nmen \u201chaven\u2019t had sex in the past year and don\u2019t seem to be bothered by it.\u201d\nMore men are living at home with their parents, and for longer too. A 2016\nreport from the Pew Research Center found young men were more likely to live\nat home with mom and dad than a partner.\n\nSo where does this all stem from? Mid-2000s video games, in Whitney\u2019s mind.\n\u201cYou have an ability to feel like you\u2019re gaming with a group of friends or\ncommunity, but you\u2019re really just at home alone,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so the\nsocialization of the young American male really started to break down\nsignificantly around that time.\u201d According to Whitney, as gaming went up, so\ndid malaise, noting a \u201cdespondency and rampant loneliness amongst young men,\u201d\nin a recent note her advisory group produced. The gaming explosion was driven\nby technological improvements and the growing popularity of gaming on an\niPhone; and it coincided with a poor job market. Combined, these forces have\ncreated a cohort of young men who don\u2019t know how to socialize, in her view.\n\u201cGaming and social isolation are somewhat of a vicious cycle in which the lack\nof real social contact creates a sense of social unease, making real social\ncontact much more uncomfortable,\u201d the note states.\n\nLast year, an analysis found that 65% of Americans played video games, and\nthat equated to more than 200 million weekly players, and a 2015 report from\nthe Pew Research Center found that 77% young men play video games\u2014more than\nany other demographic. She\u2019s said something similar before, only it was about\nsports betting.\n\n\u201cUnless you\u2019re creating a household, there\u2019s no reason to buy a house,\u201d\nWhitney said, touching on household formations and birth rates. Before the\npandemic, household growth over the previous decade was the lowest ever\nrecorded, per Pew. But another account shows a surge in household growth from\n2019 and 2021.\n\nStill, household formation and demand for housing is only one part of the\nequation. The other has to do with a \u201csilver tsunami,\u201d a metaphor for an aging\npopulation, really baby boomers in the housing world. There are varying\nestimates and predictions regarding the \u201csilver tsunami,\u201d but it all\nessentially boils down to more supply. Whitney, toward the end of last year,\nsaid 51% of people over the age of 50 are set to downsize to smaller homes,\nciting an AARP report at a conference. That would bring more than 30 million\nhousing units to the market. Separately, a recent Freddie Mac analysis\nrevealed nine million homes were set to come onto the market in the next\ndecade as baby boomers age, but suggested it wasn\u2019t going to really disrupt\nthe housing world.\n\nEither way, she sees more supply and not enough demand in the coming years,\nwhich\u2019ll culminate in plummeting home prices\u2014essentially our current situation\ninverted. Presently, we don\u2019t have enough housing to meet demand (one estimate\nshows we\u2019re actually missing anywhere between roughly two million and seven\nmillion homes), and home prices keep escalating because of it. Whitney doesn\u2019t\nthink we have a housing shortage, not on a national scale. If anything,\nthere\u2019s a shortage of affordable housing, and not enough housing where people\nactually want to live, she explained. Calling our housing crisis a\nmetropolitan crisis might be better, a housing policy analyst once told\nFortune .\n\nEven so, some research has shown single women are buying homes more than\nsingle men, so maybe they\u2019d save the housing universe? Not a chance, Whitney\nsaid. \u201cHow many single women are going to buy four bedroom, three bath homes?\u201d\nShe then brought up the 5 D\u2019s of real estate: diapers, diamonds, divorce,\ndebt, and death. \u201cWithout those...I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a big\nenough driver.\u201d\n\nStill, if what she\u2019s predicting comes true, it won\u2019t be another housing crash.\n\nSubscribe to the CFO Daily newsletter to keep up with the trends, issues, and\nexecutives shaping corporate finance.
