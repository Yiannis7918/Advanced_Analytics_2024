One for which the probability is not 1/2 is called a biased or\nunfair coin. In theoretical studies, the assumption that a coin is fair is\noften made by referring to an ideal coin.\n\nJohn Edmund Kerrich performed experiments in coin flipping and found that a\ncoin made from a wooden disk about the size of a crown and coated on one side\nwith lead landed heads (wooden side up) 679 times out of 1000.^[1] In this\nexperiment the coin was tossed by balancing it on the forefinger, flipping it\nusing the thumb so that it spun through the air for about a foot before\nlanding on a flat cloth spread over a table. Edwin Thompson Jaynes claimed\nthat when a coin is caught in the hand, instead of being allowed to bounce,\nthe physical bias in the coin is insignificant compared to the method of the\ntoss, where with sufficient practice a coin can be made to land heads 100% of\nthe time.^[2] Exploring the problem of checking whether a coin is fair is a\nwell-established pedagogical tool in teaching statistics.\n\n## Probability space definition[edit]\n\nIn probability theory, a fair coin is defined as a probability space , which\nis in turn defined by the sample space, event space, and probability measure.\nUsing for heads and for tails, the sample space of a coin is defined as:\n\nThe event space for a coin includes all sets of outcomes from the sample space\nwhich can be assigned a probability, which is the full power set . Thus, the\nevent space is defined as:\n\nis the event where neither outcome happens (which is impossible and can\ntherefore be assigned 0 probability), and is the event where either outcome\nhappens, (which is guaranteed and can be assigned 1 probability). Because the\ncoin is fair, the possibility of any single outcome is 50-50. The probability\nmeasure is then defined by the function:\n\n0| 0.5| 0.5| 1  \n---|---|---|---  \n  \nSo the full probability space which defines a fair coin is the triplet as\ndefined above. Note that this is not a random variable because heads and tails\ndo not have inherent numerical values like you might find on a fair two-valued\ndie. A random variable adds the additional structure of assigning a numerical\nvalue to each outcome. Common choices are or .\n\n## Role in statistical teaching and theory[edit]\n\nThe probabilistic and statistical properties of coin-tossing games are often\nused as examples in both introductory and advanced text books and these are\nmainly based in assuming that a coin is fair or \"ideal\". For example, Feller\nuses this basis to introduce both the idea of random walks and to develop\ntests for homogeneity within a sequence of observations by looking at the\nproperties of the runs of identical values within a sequence.^[3] The latter\nleads on to a runs test. A time-series consisting of the result from tossing a\nfair coin is called a Bernoulli process.\n\n## Fair results from a biased coin[edit]\n\nIf a cheat has altered a coin to prefer one side over another (a biased coin),\nthe coin can still be used for fair results by changing the game slightly.\nJohn von Neumann gave the following procedure:^[4]\n\n  1. Toss the coin twice.\n  2. If the results match, start over, forgetting both results.\n  3. If the results differ, use the first result, forgetting the second.\n\nThe reason this process produces a fair result is that the probability of\ngetting heads and then tails must be the same as the probability of getting\ntails and then heads, as the coin is not changing its bias between flips and\nthe two flips are independent. This works only if getting one result on a\ntrial does not change the bias on subsequent trials, which is the case for\nmost non-malleable coins (but not for processes such as the P\u00f3lya urn). By\nexcluding the events of two heads and two tails by repeating the procedure,\nthe coin flipper is left with the only two remaining outcomes having\nequivalent probability. This procedure only works if the tosses are paired\nproperly; if part of a pair is reused in another pair, the fairness may be\nruined. Also, the coin must not be so biased that one side has a probability\nof zero.\n\nThis method may be extended by also considering sequences of four tosses. That\nis, if the coin is flipped twice but the results match, and the coin is\nflipped twice again but the results match now for the opposite side, then the\nfirst result can be used. This is because HHTT and TTHH are equally likely.\nThis can be extended to any multiple of 2.\n\nThe expected value of flips at the n game is not hard to calculate, first\nnotice that in step 3 whatever the event or we have flipped the coin twice so\nbut in step 2 ( or ) we also have to redo things so we will have 2 flips plus\nthe expected value of flips of the next game that is but as we start over the\nexpected value of the next game is the same as the value of the previous game\nor any other game so it does not really depend on n thus (this can be\nunderstood the process being a martingale where taking the expectation again\nget us that but because of the law of total expectation we get that ) hence we\nhave:\n\nGraph of the further away is from the further expected number of flips before\na successful result\n\nThe more biased our coin is, the more likely it is that we will have to\nperform a greater number of trials before a fair result.\n\n## A better algorithm when P(H) is known[edit]\n\nWe first consider an algorithm to generate an arbitrary coin with bias P(H) =\nq. To get a fair coin, we set q = 0.5 and execute the following algorithm.\n\n  1. Toss the coin.\n  2. If the P(H) <= q, use H if the flip result is H. Otherwise, set q as (q-P(H)) / (1-P(H)) and restart the iteration.\n  3. Otherwise, use T is the flip result is T. Set q as q / P(H) and restart the iteration.\n\nAs there are no wasted iterations due to re-roll. This algorithm has an\nexpected number of rolls being\n\n.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Checking whether a coin is fair\n  * Coin flipping\n  * Feller's coin-tossing constants\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Kerrich, John Edmund (1946).
