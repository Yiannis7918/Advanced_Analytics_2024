Adults who\nemploy others score higher than other groups, including employees and non-\nemployer owners, on a variety of measures -- income, wealth, life evaluation\nand work engagement.\n\n### Owner-Employers in the United States Are Rare\n\nBusiness owners with employees (hereafter referred to as owner-employers) only\ncomprise an estimated 2.4% of all working adults in the U.S. Yet, other forms\nof business ownership are somewhat common. In addition to owner-employers,\n15.3% of the workforce earns some money from self-employment but primarily\nworks for an employer. Another 11.3% are mostly self-employed, and 6.9% are\nnon-employer owners, meaning they are not independent contractors but business\nowners who do not have employees. Just under two-thirds of workers (64.2%)\nwork entirely for others.\n\nOwner-employers consistently enjoy the highest levels of subjective wellbeing\namong workers of all different types of work arrangements. Self-employed\nadults tend to have the lowest scores, whereas non-employer owners and\nemployees have similar scores.\n\nFor this study, Gallup asked working adults about their wellbeing in five\ndimensions:\n\n  1. Engagement at work\n  2. Evaluation of employment situation\n  3. General life evaluation\n  4. Financial wellbeing\n  5. Whether basic needs are being met\n\nThree in four owner-employers (75.4%) indicate high levels of engagement at\nwork, compared with 68.1% of non-employer owners and 50.9% of employees. In\nthis study, high engagement means they believe their opinions count at work,\nget to do what they do best, are respected at work, get to be creative and get\nalong with colleagues. There is also a large gap in overall job evaluation:\n78.1% of owner-employers provide an evaluation score of 7 or higher (out of\n10), compared with 57.6% of non-employer owners and 55.5% of employees.\n\nRegarding financial wellbeing, 58.4% of owner-employers say they live\ncomfortably on their present income, compared with 36.0% of non-employer\nowners and employees. Likewise, only 15.2% of owner-employers indicate having\nhad some level of financial hardship in the past year, compared with 25.6% of\nnon-employer owners and 27.3% of employees.\n\nOwner-employers also rate their overall lives much higher than other workers\ndo. Two-thirds of owner-employers (66.7%) rate their current and future lives\nhighly enough to be considered \u201cthriving\u201d on a zero-to-10 scale. That figure\ncompares with 52.1% among non-employer owners, 50.7% among employees and 48.1%\namong self-employed workers.\n\n### Income and Wealth\n\nThe higher rates of subjective wellbeing associated with owning a business\nthat employs others also correspond to higher levels of income and wealth.\n\nIn the Gallup survey, owner-employers have a median personal income of\n$110,000, compared with $24,000 for non-employer owners and $62,000 for\nemployees who do not own a business. Owner-employers also have a strong\nadvantage in median household income, reporting they earn $175,000 annually,\ncompared with $100,000 for non-employer owners. Employees have similar\nhousehold incomes ($110,000) as non-employer owners.\n\nThe median value of non-business assets is approximately $550,000 for owner-\nemployers, compared with $135,000 for non-employer owners and $130,000 for\nemployees. Self-employed adults have the lowest median asset value: $46,000.\n\nThe relative differences in income and wealth between non-employer owners and\nowner-employers in these data are consistent with the U.S. government\u2019s\nleading source for the analysis of wealth -- the Survey of Consumer Finances\n(SCF). A Gallup analysis of the 2022 SCF also finds that median household\nincome is approximately twice as high for owner-employers as non-employer\nowners. As for wealth, SCF data show that median net worth is approximately\n4.6 times higher for owner-employers relative to non-employer owners, which is\nclose to the 4.1-to-1 ratio seen in the Gallup data.^2\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nEntrepreneurship is a narrow pathway to wealth. Being a business owner with no\nemployees is not associated with significantly higher income, wealth, job\nsatisfaction or life evaluation. The entrepreneurial pathway to wealth and\nwellbeing often requires that a business be large or profitable enough to be\nable to employ others. However, just 2% of all working adults and 9% of\nbusiness owners currently employ others. In 2021, 5.4 million business\napplications were filed with the Internal Revenue Service;^3 of those, only\n476,000 (9%) employed workers when they launched.^4\n\nThe associations discussed in this report are consistent with the idea that\nowning a business that employs others promotes higher subjective wellbeing,\nincome and wealth, but other explanations are possible. Many entrepreneurs\nlaunch a business using their personal savings, so higher wealth could lead to\nownership, even if ownership does not reliably increase wealth. Yet, the\nhigher incomes generated by owner-employers both in the Gallup and SCF data\nsuggest that being an owner-employer does, in fact, generate more wealth.\n\nSimilarly, personality traits associated with confidence and optimism may\nsimultaneously predict both higher subjective wellbeing and business\nownership. Gallup will seek to conduct longitudinal research on the subjective\nwellbeing of working adults to better evaluate how baseline ownership predicts\nchanges in financial and wellbeing-related outcomes.\n\nLearn more about the findings and read the full report, Entrepreneurial\nInsights: Owning and Employing as a Pathway to Wealth and Wellbeing.\n\nTo stay up to date with the latest Gallup News insights and updates, follow us\non X.\n\nLearn more about how the Gallup Panel works.\n\n#### Footnotes\n\n[1] Foner, E.

Gallup emailed 19,890 adults who had\npreviously been randomly selected to complete a Gallup survey and joined the\nPanel by offering Gallup their email address and contact permission. A\nsecondary source was obtained from the U.S. Small Business Administration,\nwhich published the addresses of all businesses that received loans (that were\nmostly converted to grants) from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), with\nfunding from two large congressional appropriations in 2020 and 2021. After\ndata cleaning, Gallup drew a random sample of 20,174 businesses and sent\npostcards by mail, inviting them to participate in a web survey. An incentive\nwas offered for survey completion. Combined, these two sources resulted in\n9,852 completed surveys with enough demographic information to create a survey\nweight, a response rate of 24.6%.^5\n\nGallup oversampled Black and Hispanic adults to ensure it could report summary\ndata by subgroups. Gallup also oversampled adults living in Kansas, Missouri,\nNebraska and Iowa, a priority area the Kauffman Foundation calls \u201cthe\nheartland.\u201d\n\nThe final sample size of 9,852 working U.S. adults included 3,117 \u201cowners,\u201d\ndefined as anyone who received at least some income in the prior month from a\nbusiness they own. Among these owners, 976 reported that they employed at\nleast one employee other than themselves. Surveys were completed between Sept.\n21 and Oct. 30, 2023.\n\nThis final pool of respondents was then weighted to be representative of\nworking owner-employers and non-employer owners among the U.S. employed adult\npopulation. This was done using the 2022 Annual Business Survey (ABS), which\nis only based on business owners operating during 2021, and the 2021 American\nCommunity Survey (ACS).^6 Using both datasets, the number of U.S. adults was\ncalculated based on owner-employer status, educational attainment, age,\nrace/ethnicity, gender and residence within \u201cthe heartland.\u201d The number of\nowners with these characteristics was calculated using the ABS, and non-owners\nwere estimated by subtracting the number of owners from the total population\n(from the ACS). The final weight makes the respondent representative of the\nU.S. working population based on those characteristics.\n\nMeasuring Subjective Wellbeing\n\nAs stated above, Gallup used five measures of subjective wellbeing for this\nresearch.\n\nFirst, Gallup measured a subset of items related to what it defines as\nemployee engagement.^7 Gallup\u2019s full engagement scale is associated with\nhigher job retention, productivity, satisfaction and performance. The items\nused here are predictive of those outcomes, though to a lesser extent. To\ncreate a proxy measure for engagement, Gallup asked five items on a 1-to-5\nLikert rating scale, with 5 indicating strong agreement and 1 indicating\nstrong disagreement with the statement. The average across all five items was\ncalculated, and respondents were considered to have high levels of engagement\nif they averaged a 4 or higher on these items:\n\n* At work, I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day.\n* At work, my opinions seem to count.\n* At work, I am treated with respect.\n* I have opportunities to be creative or innovative at my job.\n* I get along well with people I work with at my job.\n\nSecond, Gallup also asked respondents to evaluate their work situation using a\nsingle-item measure where zero is \u201cthe worst possible work situation for you\u201d\nand 10 is the best. A high score was defined as a 7 or higher on this scale.\n\nThird, Gallup asked its two-item measure of life evaluation, in which\nrespondents were asked to evaluate their life today and in five years on the\nsame zero-to-10 \u201cladder\u201d scale. Gallup routinely fields these items globally\non its World Poll, as well as in domestic surveys.^8 \u201cThriving\u201d is defined as\nscoring a 7 or higher in life evaluation today and an 8 or higher in five\nyears.\n\nFourth, as a measure of financial wellbeing, Gallup asked respondents to rate\ntheir degree of financial comfort, as in which statement best describes their\nfeelings about their household income:\n\n* Living comfortably on present income\n* Getting by on present income\n* Finding it difficult on present income\n* Finding it very difficult on present income\n\nFinally, as a measure of financial hardship, respondents were also asked if\nthere had been times in the past 12 months when they did not have enough money\nto pay for food, shelter or healthcare their family needed. A reply of \u201cyes\u201d\nto any of those three needs was coded as indicating financial hardship.\n\nAssets\n\nTo measure wealth, Gallup needed to rely on a small number of survey items to\navoid an excessively long survey. Respondents were asked if they held any of\nthe following assets, and if so, how much money the asset was worth or how\nmuch money they believed they could get for its sale: a) the respondent\u2019s\nhome, after paying off any loans, b) retirement accounts, c) a personal\nbrokerage account, d) a college savings account, e) vacation or rental\nproperties after paying off any loans, and g) personal savings accounts. The\nsum of these assets was estimated as the value of the respondent\u2019s assets.\nThis underestimates asset value if the respondent owns a business that could\npotentially be sold, but the value of a small business is difficult to\nestimate with limited information. Moreover, these estimates do not fully take\ninto account non-real estate debt such as business loans, student loans and\ncredit card loans, so they are not directly comparable to measures of net\nworth.\n\nThere are other differences between the Gallup data on income and assets and\nthe 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) data. The SCF has a somewhat larger\nsample size (about 16,000, compared with 10,000 in the Gallup survey), and the\nGallup survey uses a more restrictive definition of ownership, confining it to\nthe respondent, not the household; the SCF collects much more detailed\ninformation on the property, assets and liabilities needed to estimate wealth\nand net worth at the household level, including assets held by spouses, which\nwas not collected in the Gallup survey.\n\n## Related Topics Include:\n\nAll Gallup Headlines Economy Entrepreneurship Gallup Panel Personal Finance\nSmall Business\n\n### Access Crucial Data for Your Research\n\nSearch, examine, compare and export nearly a century of primary data.\n\nLearn More about Access Crucial Data for Your Research\n\n## Recommended\n\nEconomy\n\nMar 27, 2024\n\n### March Economic Confidence Steady, Still Improved From Fall\n\nAmericans' economic confidence in March remains higher than it was in late\n2023.\n\nThe Short Answer\n\nJun 27, 2022\n\n### Do Americans Like or Dislike 'Big Business'?\n\nWhether Americans like big business or not depends on the question.
