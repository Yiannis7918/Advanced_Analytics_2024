Grant\n\nLong-Form/Podcast: As a civilian, the beloved American Civil War general and\ntwo-term president failed at every attempt to make money. Except for one.\nWritten by Michael Durbin \u2022 Non-Fiction \u2022 April 2017\n\n\u00a9 2017 All Rights Reserved.

Ulysses S.\nGrant led Union troops to victory in the American Civil War, then thwarted\nattempts by President Andrew Johnson to suppress fundamental civil rights of\nnewly freed black Americans. Twice elected president himself, Grant stewarded\na war-torn nation as it struggled to reunify. After leaving the White House,\nhe invested his name and entire life savings to a Wall Street brokerage firm.\nIt would make him rich, he was told, and afford him a comfortable retirement.\nInstead, it would leave him penniless.\n\nLike any army commander, Grant had lost battles and had known the pain of\ndefeat. But this loss hit personally. Never before had he found himself in\nstraits so dire, literally destitute. Fortunately, the former president and\nretired general had one more fight in him\u2014because his real troubles had just\nbegun.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nHiram Ulysses Grant was born in 1822 to Ohio tannery foreman Jesse Grant and\nhis wife, Hannah. In 1839, Jesse secured a place for his son at West Point,\nnot so much for its esteem as a military academy, but because it was free. On\nhis first day there, the young man found his name listed by mistake as Ulysses\nSimpson Grant. He had always disliked his given initials\u2014H.U.G.\u2014so he came to\nrather like his new name with its patriotic abbreviation: U.S. Grant.\n\nIn 1843, at the age of 21, Grant began his career as a commissioned officer in\nMissouri, where he fell in love with his roommate\u2019s sister, Julia Dent. They\npaused their courtship when Grant was sent to fight in the Mexican-American\nWar, in which the U.S. took by force much of the current southwestern U.S.\nfrom its neighbor to the south. Personally, Grant felt opposed to what he saw\nas an unjustified use of superior military force, but he kept his political\nviews to himself. He served dutifully as a junior officer and admired the\nqualities of General Zachary Taylor, which would shape his own leadership\nstyle in a much more significant war two decades hence.\n\nUlysses and Julia\n\nUlysses and Julia married just months following the end of the Mexican-\nAmerican war in 1848, a joyous occasion for all but Grant\u2019s parents. Staunch\nabolitionists, they liked Julia enough, but could not stomach her father, a\nslave owner and staunch defender of his right to be one. Grant\u2019s parents\nboycotted the wedding.\n\nStill, the couple\u2019s mutual affection had not wilted in the five years they\nwaited to wed, nor would it ever. To him, she would forever be \u201cdear Julia\u201d,\nand to her, privately, he was always \u201cUlys\u201d. However, she would soon discover\none small problem: her husband had a remarkable inability to earn a civilian\nliving.\n\nLike many of his peers in the Army, Grant took to moonlighting to bolster his\nmeager military pay. But he failed at everything, in part from trusting\neveryone he met. He put his money into a venture to sell ice shipped in from\nthe Arctic; it melted en route. Potatoes and onions, planted in anticipation\nof a certain windfall, rotted in the ground. His partnership in an\nestablishment selling goods to soldiers, known as a sutler\u2019s store, ended when\nhe naively accepted a worthless IOU when his partner wanted out.\n\nGrant began imbibing more than he should, which for him meant just two drinks.\nThat\u2019s all it took to intoxicate the young man to the point of insensibility.\nHe usually resisted having a drink before reporting for duty, but not always.\nOne day, his commander gave the drunken officer an ultimatum: resign or be\nkicked out. Grant chose to resign.\n\nBroke, the Grants and their two infant children took up residence in a shack\nin Missouri. He peddled firewood on the streets of St. Louis to support his\nfamily, which soon included two more children. He pawned his gold watch to buy\nChristmas presents. When Julia Grant\u2019s father died, they moved into the Dent\nfamily home. They also inherited something else\u2014or rather someone else: a\nslave named William Jones.\n\nGrant could have ended his financial woes by selling the man for a thousand\ndollars, or earned even more by renting him out. Instead, he took Jones to the\nlocal courthouse and signed manumission papers, setting him free. And then\nGrant went back to peddling firewood. He would later demur when asked why he\ndid such a thing. Perhaps he was simply his father\u2019s son.\n\nAt the outbreak of the Civil War, Grant wanted back in the Army, but the Army\nwasn\u2019t interested. His reputation as a drunkard preceded him. Eventually they\ndid offer him a unit to lead, one nobody else wanted. The 21st Illinois\nArtillery was one of the rowdiest, least disciplined, and most troubled units\nin the Union Army. When Grant took command on 14 June 1861, the restless men\nwere only two weeks from the end of their enlistment. They couldn\u2019t wait to go\nhome. Then they met Grant. At the end of June, nearly every man signed up for\nanother three years. \u201cWe knew we had the best commander and the best regiment\nin the State,\u201d remarked one of them.\n\nGrant turned the unit around by demonstrating a leadership style borrowed from\nZachary Taylor in the Mexican-American War, marked by thoughtfulness,\ndecisiveness, simple orders, and\u2014above all\u2014humility. This, his soldiers\nadmired most of all. Grant shunned ostentation, flamboyance, and even a\ncommander\u2019s uniform. He dressed like his men did and looked \u201cplain as an old\nshoe,\u201d according to one Army doctor.\n\nGrant paid keen attention to detail and remembered everything. He was unafraid\nof taking risks, learned from his mistakes, and seemed to never tire. And he\nkept his drinking in check. Instead, he mostly took comfort from cigars. He\nknew not to be seen drinking, but nobody cared how much he smoked.\n\nGrant, 1868\n\nUlysses S. Grant the failure became Ulysses S. Grant the towering general,\nregarded to this day as one of the best military leaders of all time. In\naddition to military prowess, he also became known for making the most of\nwhatever he had. This caught the eye of President Abraham Lincoln, who had\ngrown dismayed with one general after another\u2014Winfield Scott, George\nMcClellan, Henry Halleck\u2014complaining they did not have enough troops, or\nsupplies, or time. Grant just did his job.\n\nWaging war was no easier for Grant than his predecessors, and more than once,\nit appeared the Confederacy might win the war. But Grant kept his wits about\nhim; he\u2019d listen carefully to every word of advice he was given, then quickly\nmake up his mind and pen an order. He communicated more easily in writing than\nin speaking, and thus would write long into the night. But he always saved\nenergy for a letter to his Julia. \u201cI have been writing until my fingers are\ntired and therefore you must excuse haste and a bad pen,\u201d he\u2019d write. \u201cKiss\nthe children for me. Ulys.\u201d\n\nThus it was Grant whose smarts and stamina\u2014and hard-won victories at places\nlike Shiloh, Vicksburg, and Richmond\u2014landed him across the desk from General\nRobert E. Lee at Appomattox Courthouse in April 1865, accepting the\nConfederacy\u2019s surrender and bringing the Civil War to a close. For Grant and\nthe nation, the feeling of relief, and hope for the future, was beyond\ndescription. But it would not last long.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nAbraham Lincoln thought the world of Grant. The feeling was mutual. Their\nwives, however, had mutual feelings of another sort. They did not get along.\nAt times, Grant had to choose between his wife and the president, as when\nLincoln invited the Grants out for an evening of leisure just days after Lee\u2019s\nsurrender. Grant\u2019s wife would have none of it. So he manufactured an excuse\nabout having to catch the next train north to visit their son. President and\nMrs. Lincoln went out that evening without the Grants, taking a short carriage\nride from the White House to Ford\u2019s Theater to watch a play. There, John\nWilkes Booth entered their box and assassinated Lincoln.\n\nGrant would never forgive himself for begging off, certain that had he\naccepted the invitation, his bodyguards stationed outside the door would have\nstopped Booth. As lieutenant general of the U.S. Army he was entitled to armed\nprotection around the clock. The president in those days was not.\n\nLincoln\u2019s assassination came just five days after Lee\u2019s surrender. Confederate\nsympathizers seized the opportunity to roll back many of Lincoln\u2019s efforts to\nreunite the nation. Unfortunately, one of those sympathizers was his own vice\npresident. Andrew Johnson had once been a senator from Tennessee, and Lincoln\ndid not select him for his vice presidential running mate. He had left that to\ndelegates to the 1864 Republican Convention, who put Johnson on the ticket in\nan effort to attract war-supporting Democrats. Now, unexpectedly occupying one\nof the most powerful offices on earth, the new commander in chief set out to\ninfluence the post-war national rebuilding effort known as Reconstruction. His\ntop priority? Maintenance of white supremacy.\n\nGrant (center left) depicted next to Lincoln, General Sherman (far left), and\nAdmiral Porter (right)\n\nGrant continued serving as Johnson\u2019s general in chief and, later, secretary of\nwar. He found himself walking a fine line, on one hand obliged to obey orders,\nbut on the other dismayed by Johnson\u2019s disregard for the rights of newly\nemancipated slaves, or \u2018freedmen\u2019. Johnson derided the Fourteenth Amendment,\nrefused to enforce measures of Congressional Reconstruction Acts, and fired\nGeneral Philip Sheridan for seeing to the registration of thousands of black\nvoters.\n\nCongress fought back. Its members united in using every means at their\ndisposal to protect the nation from a man they saw as an utter threat to the\nprospect of a reunified country. They liked Grant, who let his opposition to\nhis boss be known. Congress even passed legislation essentially preventing the\npresident from telling his war secretary what to do. Ultimately, on 24\nFebruary 1868, the House of Representatives voted for the first time ever to\nimpeach the president of the United States. The Senate failed to eject Johnson\nfrom office by a single vote.\n\nFour days later, Republicans met in Chicago to choose a nominee for Johnson\u2019s\nsuccessor. They nominated only one candidate: Grant. He won the votes of all\n650 delegates on the first ballot. In November, he was elected the nation\u2019s\n18th president, vowing to realize Lincoln\u2019s vision of a re-United States of\nAmerica.\n\nGrant is not generally remembered as a great president. By blocking Johnson\u2019s\nattempt to all but undo the Civil War, however, some might consider him at\nleast a very good one. His central mission was to protect \u201ccitizens of every\nrace and color\u201d and to ensure their \u201cpeaceful enjoyment of the rights\nguaranteed to them by the Constitution.\u201d That struggle continued well after\nhis time\u2014indeed, to the time of this writing. But Grant allowed that struggle\nto at least get underway.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nAfter leaving the White House in 1877, Grant and his family took a long tour,\ncircumnavigating the globe. He was warmly greeted everywhere and treated as a\ncelebrity. It was a refreshing tour, but expensive. He needed work. American\npresidents in those days were not entitled to a pension, and he had given up\nhis Army pension when he entered the White House.\n\nGrant had made friends with Mark Twain during his travels, who considered him\na kindred spirit, both having gone from abject failure to the heights of\nsuccess. Twain suggested that Grant write his memoirs. Grant demurred. He had\nno talent for writing, he said.\n\nThe Grants settled in New York. Friends bought him a four-story brownstone on\nEast 66th Street, near the Central Park Zoo. His son Buck lived in Manhattan\nand had invested in a brokerage firm with Ferdinand Ward, a financier who soon\nconvinced the elder Grant to join them. He need only invest $100,000 and his\nname, and he would have no job responsibilities. Grant agreed.\n\nBefore long, both he and his son would invest every dollar they had into the\nfirm of Grant & Ward. Located at 2 Wall Street, at the intersection with\nBroadway across from Trinity Church, the little firm made a big splash in no\ntime. In less than a year, the value of Grant\u2019s share was estimated at $2.6\nmillion, equivalent to roughly $70 million today.\n\nMark Twain\n\nGrant had time on his hands\u2014he truly had no real work to do at the brokerage\nfirm. The editor of Century magazine offered to pay Grant $500 per article if\nhe would write his recollections from the Civil War. Again, he said no. He was\nnot a writer and certainly didn\u2019t need the money. His life of leisure seemed a\nfitting reward for all he had done. So he visited friends, puffed his ever-\npresent cigar, filling many a room with haze, and put on weight, topping 200\npounds\u2014noticeably robust for someone five feet and eight inches tall.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nA rare request from Ferdinand Ward interrupted Grant\u2019s semi-retirement one\nday. The business faced a temporary cash shortfall of $150,000. Might Grant\nhelp? Perhaps invigorated by the chance to actually do some work for the firm,\nGrant rode his carriage to the home of William Vanderbilt, his friend and heir\nto the railroad and shipping fortune of Cornelius Vanderbilt, and got the\nmoney in no time. \u201cI care very little about Grant & Ward,\u201d said Vanderbilt.\n\u201cBut to accommodate you personally, I will draw my check for the amount you\nask.\u201d\n\nGrant took the check home and gave it to Ward, who deposited it immediately\ninto his personal bank account. Not 48 hours later, Grant arrived at 2 Wall\nStreet to a sight he could hardly believe. A mob was amassing. His firm had\ngone under, taking with it the life savings of an unknown number of\nvictims\u2014including Grant himself. The damage did not stop there. Across the\nstreet at the New York Stock Exchange, the market tumbled on the news. Ulysses\nwent home and told Julia, then emptied his pockets of cash. He looked down at\n$81 on the table. She added $130 more. It was all they had.\n\nGrant & Ward went bankrupt because its liabilities totaled $16.7 million on\nassets of $67,000. The ex-president had been kept in the dark as to the firm\u2019s\nbusiness operations. Ward had borrowed money at outrageous interest rates,\npledging firm securities as collateral\u2014a practice known as rehypothecation,\nwhich was and remains a legal practice. But he would pledge the same\nsecurity\u2014say a U.S. government bond\u2014over and over again to different lenders.\nThat part was and remains illegal. He also paid off older investors with money\nfrom new ones. It would be another four decades before this scheme earned a\npermanent name, when Charles Ponzi did the same thing with so much publicity\nthat he became eponymous with the technique.\n\nThe Grants were wiped out. The ex-president insisted on signing over his house\nto settle his $150,000 debt to Vanderbilt, who refused to take it. Instead,\nthey reached a compromise whereby Grant would hand over his war medals\u2014indeed,\nevery memento of value\u2014to the Smithsonian Institution. The Grants could remain\nin their house.\n\nDesperate now for income, Grant contacted the editors at Century, who were\nstill interested in his Civil War recollections. He agreed to write four\narticles, beginning with his personal account of the Battle of Shiloh, for\n$500 each. The magazine project turned into a book project, with Grant\nagreeing to a 10 percent royalty.\n\nGrant was elated. His friend Mark Twain was amazed, but for a very different\nreason. He thought the magazine was ripping off Grant. A 10 percent royalty,\nsaid Twain, is what \u201cthey would have offered to any unknown Comanche Indian.\u201d\nTwain offered to pay Grant 70 percent of book proceeds if he would sign with\nWebster & Company, Twain\u2019s publishing company. Although Grant had not yet\nsigned a book contract with Century, he felt obliged to honor his as-yet\nverbal agreement with Century. Twain talked him out of it.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nAs Grant settled into his writing routine, the words flowed more easily than\nhe expected. But his throat bothered him. Some months earlier, while on a trip\nto a summer cottage, he had cried out in pain after biting a peach. A doctor\nfound nothing amiss, but the pain not only refused to go away but grew worse.\nBy October, his throat nagged him so much he went to see Dr. John H. Douglas,\na specialist in New York. The doctor exuded admiration for Grant, then made a\nthorough examination and did not like what he saw. Grant may have noticed the\nconcerned expression on his face. \u201cIs it cancer?\u201d asked the general. Probably,\nanswered the doctor. A biopsy confirmed the diagnosis.\n\nAlcohol may have damaged his reputation, but the cigars, it appears, took down\nGrant\u2019s body with a ferocity he hadn\u2019t experienced since the war. Grant\u2019s\nthroat cells were multiplying aggressively, starving normal cells for\nnutrients, laying siege. Grant could not win this civil war, one of the most\nintimate kind. Cancer was all but untreatable in those days. But the general\ncould still battle. \u201cThis man fights,\u201d Lincoln had once said of Grant. And so\nhe did now.\n\nGrant put every ounce of strength into writing, determined to leave his wife\nand family with a source of income when he was gone. He wrote diligently for\nfour hours each morning. In the afternoon, one of his children would read it\nback or help check his facts. He insisted on getting everything right.\n\nTwain visited whenever he could to read Grant\u2019s drafts and offer encouragement\nand genuine praise. He remarked that only one writer in a hundred could write\ncopy as clean as Grant\u2019s. Twain was then reading Julius Caesar\u2019s Commentaries\nand said, \u201cThe same high merits distinguished both books\u2014clarity of statement,\ndirectness, simplicity, unpretentiousness, manifest truthfulness, fairness and\njustice toward friend and foe alike, soldierly candor and frankness, and\nsoldierly avoidance of flowery speech.\u201d\n\nNot only could this man fight, he could write, too. He drew upon his keen\nmemory for detail that had served him so well in war in accounts such as that\nof the lead up to the Battle of Petersburg:\n\n> \u201cOne of the most anxious periods of my experience during the rebellion was\n> the last few weeks before Petersburg. I felt that the situation of the\n> Confederate army was such that they would try to make an escape at the\n> earliest practicable moment, and I was afraid, every morning, that I would\n> awake from my sleep to hear that Lee had gone.\u201d\n\nGrant writing his memoirs, days before his death\n\nThe work was agonizing, as was the pain, especially from swallowing. When\nGrant could not sleep, his doctor applied muriate of cocaine to his throat,\nwhich brought instant relief. The doctor would turn Grant\u2019s pillow to the cool\nside and instruct him to turn on his side and bring up his knees, sleeping as\na child does.\n\nGrant\u2019s weight dropped from over 200 pounds to 130\u2014what he weighed as a young\narmy commander. Back then, it was a sign of fitness. Now, emaciation. He\nchilled easily despite a shawl and knit cap. Twice a day, he went to see his\ndoctor, by streetcar in order to save cab fare. He took morphine for the\nrelentless pain. When that stopped working, his doctor gave him shots of\nbrandy\u2014by hypodermic needle.\n\nWhen not writing his memoirs, Grant found time for correspondence, including a\nfarewell letter to his wife. \u201cThere are some matters about which I would like\nto talk but about which I cannot. The subject would be too painful,\u201d he wrote\non a sheet of paper hidden in a coat pocket, to be found after his death. \u201cI\nbid you a final farewell until we meet in another, and I trust better world.\u201d\n\nGrant structured his memoirs into two volumes. The first he wrote entirely in\nlonghand, in pencil, on blue-lined, yellow paper. As he began the second, he\nhad weakened such that writing by hand took too much energy. At Twain\u2019s\nsuggestion, he hired a stenographer, Noble E. Dawson, the general\u2019s former\nsecretary then working for the U.S. Senate, who came up from Washington, D.C.\n\nDawson would later describe the experience:\n\n> \u201cGeneral Grant dictated very freely and easily. He made very few changes and\n> never hemmed and hawed... As he went on his voice became weaker and weaker,\n> and toward the last, I had to take my seat very close to his, and he\n> whispered his words in my ear while I took them down in shorthand. His last\n> dictation was on the 22nd of June, 1885... After this he would sit with his\n> pad on his knee near me, and would write down his ideas and sometimes\n> doodle. He was very weak, and his hand grew more and more trembling as he\n> neared his death.\u201d\n\nIn July 1885, Dawson told Grant\u2019s son Fred that the writing was practically\nfinished. Grant had written and edited the first volume and written the\nsecond, which others could edit. \u201cI think we had better tell your father that\nthe book is done,\u201d Dawson advised.\n\nGrant could hardly believe it. He asked that the entire work be read aloud.\nHis children took turns obliging, but he was only strong enough to hear the\nfirst volume, by then too weak even to listen. He died a little past eight\no\u2019clock in the morning of 23 July 1885.\n\nGrant had written 275,000 words in less than a year\u2014roughly three times the\nlength of a typical novel, which an author might take several years to write.\nHe lived just long enough to feel the relief any writer feels when completing\na manuscript, but died before his memoirs were published. Grant would never\nknow if his last venture to provide for his family would be a financial\nsuccess or yet another failure.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nGrant's tomb in Upper Manhattan\n\nOn 08 August 1885, Grant\u2019s funeral procession began with the ringing of the\nbells of Trinity Church, directly across the street from 2 Wall Street. At\nthat instant, a Western Union telegraph operator sent a signal to waiting\nreceivers in towns across the U.S. and into Mexico so that all across North\nAmerica, bells would ring 63 times, Grant\u2019s age, at 30-second intervals.\n\nThe line of mourners marching slowly behind the casket stretched more than\nseven miles. Julia was too wrought with grief to be among them. In the four-\nperson carriage at the head of the cort\u00e8ge rode Union generals William\nTecumseh Sherman and Philip Sheridan, knee-to-knee with Confederate generals\nJoe Johnston and Simon Bolivar Buckner. It was a reunion once unthinkable.\nNow, former mortal rivals sat together, such was the universal admiration for\nGrant.\n\nFour months later, the first printing of The Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S.\nGrant went on sale. Twain had orchestrated a clever subscription campaign so\nreaders might pre-order one of three different bindings, each at a different\nprice point, to maximize revenue. He suspected an adoring and grieving public\nwas eager both to read Grant\u2019s words and to help his wife. He was right.\n\nTwain presented Julia Grant with a check for $200,000. It was then the largest\nroyalty payment ever made and would be followed by more. In the end, she would\nreceive roughly $450,000, or nearly $12 million in today\u2019s dollars. Julia\nwould pine the rest of her days for her beloved Ulys, but not for money.\nUlysses S. Grant proved, at last, he could make money as a civilian, as a\nwriter. His book remains in print to this day.\n\n\u00a9 2017 All Rights Reserved.

As always, your articles leave me wanting to know more.\nThank you!\n\nAs for the sentence being discussed in the comments above, it works either\nway, including the way it was written in the article. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth\narguing about. Just enjoy reading an article that\u2019s really damn interesting!\n;)\n\nSteve\n\nPosted 12 April 2017 at 12:42 pm\n\ngrendel25, I disagree with your disagreement, and here is why.\n\nThe clause \u201chis opposition to his boss\u201d is a *subject* clause. You can tell\nthat it is a subject, because it doesn\u2019t contain a verb. (Subject clauses can\nalso contain verbs, but if they don\u2019t, then you know that they are definitely\nsubject clauses.) Being a subject clause, it cannot be used as the object of\nthe phrase \u201cwho let it be known [that]\u201d. So the sentence is nowhere near\ngrammatically correct as (originally) written, and indeed demonstrates a\ncomplete misunderstanding of the difference between a subject and an object.\n\nTo fix it, the phrase \u201cwho let it be known [that]\u201d needs to be followed by an\n*object* clause, describing something that can be known. This clause would\nlook like a complete sentence on its own, and in particular needs a verb. For\nexample, you could let it be known that you don\u2019t know the difference between\na subject and an object. *That* clause includes the verb \u201cknow\u201d, and can\ntherefore stand as a sentence on its own. Hence it makes a perfectly good\nobject clause.\n\nAs richs says, if you were to instead remove the existing subject \u201cit\u201d from\n\u201cwho let it be known\u201d, then you could use \u201chis opposition to his boss\u201d as the\nsubject of that phrase. Otherwise the sentence has two subjects, referring to\nthe same thing, with no conjunctive glue of any sort, making a complete hash\nof the grammar. It is no more correct than \u201cThe cat it ate some food.\u201d Try\ngetting that past your second grade teacher.\n\nHope that helps! It looks like the offending sentence has already been\nrewritten anyway.\n\n(And Daisy, it\u2019s always worth arguing about, arguing is fun too!)\n\nGeoff Smith\n\nPosted 14 April 2017 at 12:36 am\n\nI don\u2019t care over much for the grammatical debate, but I would like to say\nthat I found this to be a brilliantly written article about a man I knew\nlittle about. I found him to be a fascinating man and this story will remain\nwith me for many years.

Grant\u2019s book was\nincredible\u2013he was a brilliant writer\u2013and well worth reading. I couldn\u2019t make\nit far into Sherman\u2019s book; putting it kindly, his writing style was not the\nbest, as I remember.\n\nJarvis Loop\n\nPosted 15 April 2017 at 07:13 am\n\nMr. Smith:\n\nYou wrote exactly what I intended to write myself.\n\nAnything else from me would be painting the lily.\n\nBy the way, my family comes from England, and a small village in North\nYorkshire bears my surname.\n\nMay I ask in which part of England you live?\n\nMike B\n\nPosted 16 April 2017 at 01:18 am\n\nThe funeral photo is wrong.

I learned quite some\nyears ago not to tell anyone in the South where I was from, unless I prefaced\nit with the fact that I was born in Kentucky.\n\nMr. Durbin\u2019s article also mentions General Sheridan. By coincidence, General\nSheridan grew up about 20 miles southeast of Lancaster in a little town call\nSomerset.\n\nJames Matthews\n\nPosted 17 April 2017 at 08:38 pm\n\nWilliam S.

I love reading stuff like this. There is so much history\nthat I missed as a teenager because I wasn\u2019t interested. I means so much more\nto me now. Thanks again Michael.\n\nSean\n\nPosted 19 April 2017 at 10:28 am\n\nThis article continues to present the misnomer that grant was an alcoholic. It\nalso fails to present the conditions that led up to the one point in Grants\nlife when he drank to much which resulted in his early retirement. Grant and\nhis troops were being deployed to the west coast by way of panama before the\ncanal. They were allowed to take there families but grants left his behind\nbecause his wife was pregnant and he knew the perils of the Panama crossing. A\ngreat number of his men and there families got sick with malaria during the\ncrossing. Grant acquired a ship to serve has a hospital and helped tend his\nmen and there families, many whom died. Struggling with little to do when\nfinally reaching the west coast, being away from his family, the horrors of\nthe crossing and a senior officer who was not fond of grant he turned to\nalcohol for one time in his life, got in trouble and was drummed out of the\narmy. The rumor of his alcohol issue was spread by his detractors but\naccording to his army secretary in the war, doctor and those who were with him\nfor much of his life following the incident claim they never witnessed him\nover imbibe or drink in excess. It is a slander that has stuck which him but\nif you look deeper into the accounts of those who were close to grant for most\nof his life and career after the west coast stint they all claim to never have\nseen him abuse alcohol.

I would point out however, the content was\nfascinating and the writing style, in my humble opinion, excellent. Put it\nthis way I thoroughly enjoyed it and learned a lot. That works for me. Thank\nyou.\n\nMount McGregor\n\nPosted 28 March 2018 at 12:16 pm\n\nI read this article after just having finished Ron Chernow\u2019s biography of Mr.\nGrant named Grant. For all of you grammar bloodhounds, I would have underlined\nthe title except that this little comment program wouldn\u2019t let me. You are\nwelcome to pull me apart on anything else.\n\nI highly recommend that book. I fell in love with Grant, the book and the man.\nChernow covers the drinking in a comprehensive way. The letters, quotes, and\nanecdotes that he provides give a nuanced analysis of a sticky issue in\nGrant\u2019s life. His military aide and self-appointed personal protector John\nRawlins\u2019 descriptions of his boss to others, and his uber-vigilance of him\nduring the war are particularly telling. Anyway, read the book. You\u2019re gonna\nlove it! I guarantee it!\n\nRoadrunner\n\nPosted 21 April 2018 at 03:55 pm\n\nIt\u2019s been a few years since I\u2019ve stopped to read your articles, I miss them,\nmust try to catch up.\n\nJarvisLoop\n\nPosted 03 April 2020 at 07:16 pm\n\nJust checking back in to see who else has checked in since 2017.\n\nPraps\n\nPosted 06 June 2020 at 09:13 pm\n\nAfter reading this article I feel that Grant was a great man who really cared\nfor his wife because despite the pain and weakness from the disease he kept on\nwriting so that his wife would not have to go through the hardship after he\nwas gone.\n\nPez\n\nPosted 27 June 2020 at 04:08 am\n\nHe wasnt that steadfast an antislaver.\n\n\u2018 A letter from Grant to his sister, Mary, in 1859 describes \u201cI now have three\nnegro men, two hired by the year and one of Mr. Dents, which, with my own\nhelp, I think, will enable me to do my farming pretty well\u2019\n\n\u2022 END OF COMMENTS \u2022\n\n#### Share This Page\n\n\u00d7\n\nPlease donate! ... in donations in the next ....\n\n#### Legal Stuff\n\nDesign & logo \u00a9 2005-2024 Alan Bellows \u2022 All text/images/media \u00a9 copyright\ntheir respective creators \u2022 All rights reserved\n\n  * About Us/FAQ\n  * Explore Our Catalog\n  * Using Our Content\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Write With Us\n  * Advertise With Us\n  * Contact\n\n#### Share This Page\n\n#### Subscribe via Email\n\nReceive an email notification whenever we post new original content.
