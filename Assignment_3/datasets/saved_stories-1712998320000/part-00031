Credit: Science (2024). DOI: 10.1126/science.adg0564\n\nFour new studies led by Harvard Medical School researchers at Boston\nChildren's Hospital reveal details about how B cells in the immune system\nchurn out antibodies that become increasingly potent and specific after we're\nvaccinated or exposed to an infection.\n\nTwo of the studies show how to enhance this process\u2014known as affinity\nmaturation\u2014to lay a foundation for developing more broadly protective vaccines\nand antibody-based biologic treatments.\n\nThe other two studies uncover ways in which affinity maturation sometimes goes\nawry, creating antibodies that attack the body's own cells. The findings\nsuggest new strategies for treating autoimmune diseases.\n\n## Honing antibodies for vaccines and biologics\n\nPrevious lab-based approaches to creating more potent antibodies have fallen\nshort, leading to disruption of B-cell function or the creation of antibodies\nthat are inefficient and unstable.\n\nResearchers led by Yiming Yin, HMS research fellow in pediatrics in the lab of\nMichael Farzan, HMS professor of pediatrics at Boston Children's, set out to\ncapture the natural power of affinity maturation.\n\nAs described in Nature Biomedical Engineering in March, they performed CRISPR\ngene editing on B cells in mice, replacing genes for antibody light and heavy\nchains with their human counterparts at appropriate locations along\nchromosomes.\n\n\"Our goal is to harness the underlying wisdom of our own immune system,\"\nFarzan said. \"Humans have very specific immune features that animal models\ndon't mimic.\"\n\nThe animals' B cells then underwent affinity maturation, producing potent\nhuman antibodies in a short amount of time.\n\nAs a proof of concept, Farzan, Yin, and colleagues introduced the genomes for\nHIV antibodies into mouse B cells. They then exposed the cells to a test HIV\nvaccine and allowed affinity maturation to happen.\n\nThis generated new and better antibodies against HIV\u2014something they hope to\ntry next in non-human primates.\n\nIn another test, they got mouse B cells to shift from making antibodies\nagainst early strains of SARS-CoV-2 to making antibodies able to neutralize\nomicron variants.\n\n## An adjuvant to charge up flu vaccines?\n\nIn separate work, Pankaj Sharma, HMS research fellow in pediatrics, and\ncolleagues in the lab of Florian Winau, HMS associate professor of pediatrics\nin the Boston Children's Program in Cellular and Molecular Medicine, focused\non germinal centers, the structures in our lymph nodes and spleen that\nfacilitate B cell maturation.\n\nThey found that a lipid called Gb3 is needed for B cells to mature in the\ngerminal center and make high-affinity antibodies.\n\nGb3 also increases the diversity of B cell responses, leading to the\ngeneration of broadly neutralizing antibodies, Winau said.\n\nWhen the researchers added Gb3 to a flu vaccine, the vaccine protected against\ndiverse strains of influenza, a virus that tends to mutate and elude vaccines.\nThey propose that Gb3 be used as an adjuvant for vaccination, potentially for\na variety of viral infections. They are also now testing Gb3 as an adjuvant\nfor anti-cancer vaccines.\n\nFindings were published in Science in February.\n\n## New insights on autoimmunity: How B cells go rogue\n\nTwo more studies explored how B cells sometimes go overboard, producing\nantibodies that attack a person's own tissues.\n\nThe first\u2014led by Elliot Hideki Akama-Garren, an HMS MD student and Harvard\nGriffin Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Ph.D. student in the Program in\nImmunology studying in the PCMM lab of Michael Carroll, HMS professor of\npediatrics (pathology)\u2014focused on follicular T cells, which provide signals to\nhelp B cells with affinity maturation.\n\nThe team found that a specific set of follicular T cells can go rogue, leading\nto the formation of B cells that lose their tolerance to the body's tissues\nand produce autoreactive (self-attacking) antibodies.\n\nThe findings may have treatment implications for autoimmune conditions such as\nlupus and rheumatoid arthritis as well as the development of autoreactive\nantibodies in people with Epstein-Barr virus or COVID-19.\n\nFindings were published in February in Science Immunology.\n\n## Making B cells autoreactive\n\nA companion study from the Carroll lab\u2014led by former postdoctoral fellow Theo\nvan den Broek and Kristine Oleinika, HMS research fellow in pediatrics\u2014further\ninvestigated how autoimmune disease is initiated.\n\nThe study began with the knowledge that B cells that have lost tolerance to\nthe body's own tissues can take hold in areas of the body called germinal\ncenters, where B cells get activated and tuned to specific targets.\n\nIn people with early or low-level autoimmune disease, naive B cells\u2014those not\nyet exposed to a vaccine or pathogen\u2014enter these germinal centers and then go\nrogue as well, producing a wide range of autoreactive antibodies.\n\nCarroll and colleagues wanted to understand what allows this to happen.\n\nBy joining the blood circulations of wild-type mice and mice with lupus, they\ncould observe the development of autoimmunity in real time. They identified\nseveral ingredients that enable healthy B cells to invade autoreactive\ngerminal centers: Toll-like receptor 7, B cell receptor specificity, antigen\npresentation, and type 1 interferon signaling.\n\nWhile more work is needed, Carroll believes the insights from these two\nstudies could lead to new targets for treating autoimmunity.\n\n\"These latest observations will allow us to break down the kinetics of how new\nclones of autoreactive B cells become activated and how disease 'spreads' to\nnew tissue targets, which is a major problem in diseases such as lupus,\" he\nsaid.\n\nFindings were published in March in Science Immunology.\n\nMore information: Yiming Yin et al, In vivo affinity maturation of mouse B\ncells reprogrammed to express human antibodies, Nature Biomedical Engineering\n(2024).
