That's the paradox.\n\nThe Great Filter is one solution to this paradox. It proposes that some big\nbad event inevitably happens in the course of any developing civilization that\ndooms it, and it's the same event or events for every civilization.\n\nUsually, ideas for possible Great Filters are dramatic and looming like\nnuclear war, climate change, hyperintelligent AI, plague, or exhaustion of\nresources.\n\nI'd like to propose some more wholesome alternatives, each a little more\nunhinged than the last.\n\n## Stopped Having \"Happy Accidents\"\n\nWhen speaking about populations, replacement is when the average person\nproduces 1.0 children. Mathematically replacement is vital to the continuation\nof any species. An average production of even 0.9 children per person means\neach generation is smaller than the last, until there is simply no next\ngeneration.\n\nWe already know that as populations develop, birth rates decline.\nContraceptives, family planning, education, individual freedoms, and\nopportunity all work together to create more thoughtful and intentional\nreproduction.\n\nHistorically, reaching replacement has been easy. It has had to be. Sex is\nfun, and sex makes children, so children get made.\n\nBut as we approach a world that disconnects recreational sex from conception,\nit's possible we won't reach replacement. It's possible we won't even get\nclose. How many couples do you know who plan to have 3+ children?\n\nPerhaps the largest human generation ever to exist already does. It will be a\nfantastic thing for each individual to lead their life how they want. It might\nalso end the species. Lack of reproductive freedom is one of the more sinister\nevolutionary necessities. Perhaps once a species advances enough to fix it,\nit's the beginning of the end.\n\nPerhaps countless civilizations have already gone through this.\n\n## Purposefully Stopped Inventing\n\nHumans are unique on the planet for two reasons. First, we\u2019re toolmakers.\nSecond, we pine for more. More everything. The richest and most accomplished\namong us still want more. This carnal desire has brought us far\nevolutionarily, intellectually, and economically.\n\nThis desire for excess is probably a prerequisite for any species to become\nadvanced. But perhaps that desire eventually causes enough planet-scale issues\nthat it forces the realization that it can be overcome.\n\nA small problem is ignorable and a medium problem is annoying, but a big\nproblem is fixed.\n\nMaybe we\u2019ll reach some philosophical understanding of the universe and our own\nnature that shuts down that desire for excess, that makes every human being\nhappy and healthy but doesn't also advance science, or at least spacefaring\nscience.\n\nIf so, civilizations that have those two properties necessary for growth are\nstopped from growing by those very same properties' eventual destructive\ntendencies.\n\nOnce overcome, perhaps we'll stop extraplanetary operations and live out our\nlives on the planet we grew up on, solarpunk style.\n\nPerhaps countless of civilizations are currently doing this.\n\n## Stunted by our Carrier\n\nWe're only starting to understand the complexity of the gut biome. It is an\nentire colony of bacteria\u2014a civilization\u2014that operates inside us in symbiosis.\n\nThe bacteria in the biome probably don't know that their world is inside a\nperson, who lives in an even larger world.\n\nMaybe we're in someone else's gut biome. In the same way a bacterium doesn't\nhave concepts for a coffee table or a planet, we could be missing concepts\nmuch larger than us\u2014outside the visible universe, maybe\u2014that influence our\nworld or galaxy or universe the same way our bodies influence our gut biomes.\n\nMaybe that larger being has some defense mechanism\u2014like we have white blood\ncells\u2014that prevents civilizations from getting into a bad state, and\nintersolar operations are a bad state.\n\nPerhaps countless civilizations have already gone through this.\n\n## Left\n\nMaybe every civilization advanced to the point where they found a way out. Out\nof our universe, or our of our spatial or temporal dimensions. Maybe they\ndiscovered time travel and there\u2019s some reason they really wanted to use it,\nso they time traveled their entire civilization far into the future, like past\nthe heat death of the universe.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s what dark energy is\u2014planets or star systems or galaxies that are\ntime traveling from the past into the future, pulling the metaphorical fabric\nof spacetime up instead of weighing it down.\n\nPerhaps countless civilizations will meet each other on the other side.\n\n## #nofilter\n\nMaybe everything is perfect and many extraterrestrial civilizations exist just\nfine, just not in ways we can perceive, and maybe they equally cannot perceive\nus. Maybe they are what dark matter is.\n\nMaybe there are entire empires spread across the galaxies thriving, but they\nsomehow exist and have always existed in a perceptual level of the universe we\ndon\u2019t even know about, like how my dog doesn't know about wifi.\n\nPerhaps countless civilizations are out there, existing among us.\n\n## Would It Be Bad to be Filtered?\n\nSome of these Great Filters would actually be advancements. It would be great\nto reach fully reproductive freedom, or to re-achieve symbiosis with the\nresources available to us.\n\nIt pulls at me, though, that in these scenarios the species will stop\nexisting, because I really want us to continue existing. I'm a curious person.\nI'm so curious, that even after I'm dead I want others to uncover all my\nunsatisfied curiosities of physics and the universe, even if I won't be around\nto be curious about them anymore.\n\nBut that's not my choice to make. If everyone alive is happy, and our species\ndwindles into nothingness because of it... is that bad?\n\nMaybe countless civilizations have already gone through it.\n\nsource: src/cold/filters.md published 2024 April\n\n", "frontpage": false}
