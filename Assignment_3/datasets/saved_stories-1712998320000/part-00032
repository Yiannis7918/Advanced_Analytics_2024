The Soviet Union finally\nbecame the Bolshevik behemoth the Allies had dreaded. Nothing is more\nemblematic of the Soviet Union\u2019s ascendancy as a global power during World War\nII than the T-34 tank, which owed its legendary status not to its prowess on\nthe battlefield but to the ways the defeated Nazis and the victorious Soviets\nperceived the T-34 as the tank that won the war.\n\nA decommissioned T-34 on display in Poland | Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe Soviet T-34 medium tank was evaluated by military officials as magnificent\ndue to the praise and legendary treatment heaped upon it by the Soviets and\nNazis alike. The shock and humiliation the Germans suffered in defeat led them\nto credit the T-34 with victory rather than the men and women who commanded\nthem. The Soviets intentionally misled their own allies by shipping several\nT-34\u2019s of abnormally high quality to Great Britain. In truth, it was the self-\ndeception and conjecture employed by both the Soviets and the Nazis that\nveiled the T-34\u2019s mediocrity.\n\nAs a consequence of the German determination to preserve their remaining\nnational dignity and the Soviet need to mislead their own Allies for support,\nthe T-34 became a symbol of Soviet victory and a flimsy justification of Nazi\ndefeat. Commanders of the Nazi Wehrmacht attempted to reconcile their defeat\nwith the notion that the Soviets possessed soldiers as capable of their own by\nattributing defeat to the T-34\u2019s effectiveness and numerical superiority.\nUltimately, their efforts supported Soviet endeavors to deceive the Allies\ninto sending them more munitions and raw materials. After the tide of battle\nbegan to turn in favor of the Soviets with the proliferation of the T-34, an\neventual Soviet victory was commonly attributed to the correlation between\nSoviet victory and the arrival of the T-34 on the battlefield.^1\n\nTo understand the extent to which perceptions based on deception and\nconjecture manipulated the truth, it\u2019s important to know the actual\nspecifications of the T-34. A technical evaluation of the T-34 reveals the\ndisconnect between the tank\u2019s prestige and the bitter truth that the\neconomical design of the T-34 rendered it mediocre at best. There are several\nimportant metrics for judging a tank\u2019s performance including firepower,\nmobility and reliability. The T-34 was left wanting in many of these areas due\nto the lack of resources needed to produce a tank already deficient in armor\nand firepower.^2\n\nDirectly related to these deficiencies was the Soviet loss in tanks, which\nmirrored their enormous loss in lives. Between mid 1941 and 1944, the Soviet\nUnion suffered 22,721,900 casualties and 83,500 tanks\u2014a number that dwarfs the\nlosses suffered by any other great power during the war.^3 How then can claims\nof the T-34\u2019s greatness be supported as the tanks were being destroyed in\nrecord numbers?\n\nThe Soviets attempted to do just that. On the eve of Operation Barbarossa, the\nmassive Nazi German invasion of the Soviet Union, Soviet materiel (military\nequipment, not to be confused with material) designers prepared a shipment of\nthree T-34\u2019s to be evaluated by British authorities. The Soviet high command\nviewed this action as an opportunity to secure further support from the Allies\n\u2014 the United States and Great Britain. These western democracies feared a\npotential Bolshevik super-state once the fascist threat had been dealt with.\nAs a result, they were reluctant to extend aid to the besieged Soviet Union.\nSoviet officials understood at this point that their own allies wanted the\nSoviet Union to be weak, but not weak enough to succumb to the Nazi invasion\nforces. As the situation became increasingly dire in the Soviet theater, the\nAllies became progressively more sympathetic to the Soviet cause. The Soviets\nnow needed a way to to gain the confidence of their allies without alarming\nthem to their growing power.^4\n\nThe recent mass production of T-34\u2019s presented the Soviets with a fortuitous\nopportunity to deceive the Allied forces into granting them aid. Soviet\nPremier and autocrat Joseph Stalin sent the three most exceptional T-34\u2019s to\nAberdeen in Great Britain for them to evaluate. The Soviets produced these\nthree T-34\u2019s from factories that had since fallen under Nazi occupation, and\ntheir quality was superior to those being produced at the time of their\nshipment. Regardless, the materiel officers at Aberdeen were unimpressed. The\nhighest praise heaped on the T-34 at the time was that the telescopic sight\nwas \u201c...relatively good for it\u2019s time,\u201d and that overall it was \u201cappropriate\u201d\nand \u201cacceptable.\u201d Despite this tepid response, displaying the adequacy of\nSoviet armor was enough to help garner the Allied support for the Soviet Union\nthat was critical to later victories.^5\n\nIt would not be until the Soviets drove the Nazis back to their homeland that\nGerman Wehrmacht officers would begin to express their terror of the T-34 and\nof the famed Soviet \u2018General Frost,\u2019 a euphemism for the brutal Russian\nwinters that tore apart the invading Nazi forces.^6 By that time, the T-34 had\ngained great prestige for its instrumental role in the battles of Stalingrad\nand Kursk, the battles credited for turning World War II in favor of the\nAllies.^7 Despite their instrumental role in victory, the T-34 did not gain\nits legendary status through merit, but by the sheer quantity of T-34\u2019s that\nparticipated in the Soviet victory against the Nazis. The T-34\u2019s association\nwith an Allied victory caused public opinion to cast the T-34 in a favorable\nlight thereafter. Moreover, the staggering losses sustained by the Soviets,\neven in victory, point to the inferiority of the T-34. When quantity becomes\nthe metric for quality, one must determine the flaws that rendered the T-34\nsub-par.\n\nA tank\u2019s armor provides a good starting point for comparing rival tank models.\nThe hardness, or the quality and thickness of a tank\u2019s armor, reflects its\nability to withstand enemy fire while remaining operational. The T-34\npossessed armor that averaged about 1.6 inches thick, with the thickest armor\nconcentrated around the front of its hull. The thickness of the T-34\u2019s armor\nis impressive when compared to the American-made M4 Sherman which had only 0.5\ninches of armor plating. However, when compared to the German Tiger 1 tank,\nthe T-34 pales in comparison.^8\n\nThat the T-34 possessed as much armor as it did is remarkable given the\ndesperate condition the Soviet Union was in. The Soviets produced over 52,000\nT-34\u2019s and 6,000 T-34 alterations throughout the war and began to produce the\ntank en masse after 1941.^9 The amount of material and skilled labor needed to\ntemper and weld armor for such an army is staggering. When compared to the\nroughly 1,300 Tiger 1\u2019s Germans built throughout the war, the Soviet mass of\n52,000 T-34\u2019s is even more impressive. However, sheer thickness of armor is\nnot a good indicator of its strength. Quality must be considered, and in that\nregard the Tiger 1 had a distinct advantage.\n\nFour models of the T-34, the most mass produced tank of World War II | 31 December 1940 | Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe Soviet Union experienced massive shortages of resources throughout the\nwar, which led to a decline in the quality of their military equipment. At the\nsame time, the advance of German troops throughout the most developed parts of\nthe Soviet Union forced factories to relocate and lose many of their skilled\nlaborers and adopt new and often archaic production methods.^10\n\nAs a result of constant relocation and a perpetual loss of resources and\nmanpower, most T-34\u2019s were outfitted with hastily constructed armor welded by\nunskilled laborers in insufficiently equipped facilities. Production\nsupervisors became concerned more with the appearance of the T-34\u2019s armor in\nan effort to appease leadership, and as a result the quality of T-34\u2019s varied\nbetween factories. Overall, this lack of uniformity, good steel and skillful\nwelding led the T-34\u2019s armor being less effective than its specifications\nwould suggest.^11\n\nDespite many key and critical design flaws, the T-34 did have an edge in its\npotential firepower. The T-34 was equipped with the 76.2mm F-34 tank gun,\nwhich could damage, if not destroy nearly any tank produced early in the war.\nHowever, conditions on the field and the poor design of the tank\u2019s interior\nmade this prospect unlikely. Most T-34\u2019s were not outfitted with radio\ntransmitters or receivers, which made communication among a tank division\nnearly impossible. The area of the interior where ammunition was stored and\nloaded on the T-34, known as the turret ring, was too small. As a result, the\nT-34 could only fire three rounds per minute. Moreover, the role of gunner\noften fell on the commander due to the small interior.^12 This compounded the\nproblem of divisional coordination with communication within the tank itself.\nAs the T-34 commanders must preoccupy themselves with firing the main gun,\nthey were less available to issue orders and organize those under their\ncommand, let alone communicate with other T-34 crews.\n\nT-34 with winter livery coating used by the Soviet Red Guards after 1941 | Courtesy of Tanks Encyclopedia.\n\nCompounding these communication problems, the troops operating a T-34 could\nbarely even see the battlefield. The gunner-commander also had to contend with\npoor weapon sights that hampered its ability to mark targets and fire\naccurately. Despite this, tank specialists in Aberdeen that reviewed the T-34\nconsidered the telescopic sights of the tank slightly above average. The sight\nprovided firing accuracy of up to a distance of 600-800 meters, which was\ngenerally the maximum range that tanks would engage each other from. However,\nthey only had the opportunity to review three T-34\u2019s. Their review is an\nentirely inadequate indication of the quality of the other 52.^13 Sadly, many\nof these sights suffered from poor quality lens-making techniques, making\nthese specified conditions an ideal and not a reality. Lenses often had\nblemishes, imperfections, and even appeared foggy when looked through by T-34\ngunners.^14\n\nThese factors led to a disconnect between the potential firepower of the T-34\nunder ideal or testing conditions and its practical firepower under\nbattlefield conditions of duress. T-34 gunners, while equipped with above\naverage weapons, had to cope with tight quarters in which they could neither\nhear nor see the battlefield well. However, under testing conditions on flat\nterrain and with clear lines of sight, the T-34 performed well. This\nrelationship between battlefield conditions and testing conditions would\nbecome a main proof that public opinion played a major role in determining the\nT-34\u2019s quality.^15\n\nOf all the qualities attributed to the T-34, its speed and maneuverability are\nthe most discussed historically. The T-34 could reach speeds of 33mph, which\nfar surpassed the capabilities of its rivals. In comparison, the German Tiger\n1 tank could attain speeds of only 25mph and only half that on rugged terrain.\nThe M4 Sherman was a bit more competitive at 30mph. These numbers are quite\ndeceptive though, as a number of design flaws hampered the T-34\u2019s ability to\nmaintain these speeds and operate at long ranges.^16\n\nWhere the T-34 enjoyed an advantage was the power of its engine and its wide\ntracks, which enabled it to accelerate quickly and navigate difficult terrain\nbetter than its rivals. The T-34 diesel engine possessed enormous power,\nrapidity and torque. Moreover, it had a better fuel economy than other tanks\nproduced at the time.^17 The failures of the T-34\u2019s transmission negated the\nsheer power and torque of the tank. The T-34 had only four forward gears,\nwhich prevented it from maximizing the power of its engine. Moreover, T-34\ndrivers needed to exert an enormous amount of energy and force to switch\ngears, as the T-34\u2019s clutch used to switch gears was notoriously difficult to\nuse.^18\n\nThe short lifetime and vast quantity of T-34\u2019s somewhat compensated for the\nlow quality of each individual tank. Each T-34 was given a factory guarantee\nto work without fail for 1,000 kilometers of travel, yet the average T-34 did\nnot exceed 200 kilometers before its destruction or critical failure.^19 It\nwasn\u2019t uncommon for the tanks of World War II to break down after so few\nmiles. Yet the life expectancy of Soviet tanks was far lower than its\ncontemporaries, at between 4-10 days or 1-3 attacks.^20 In a way the Soviet\nstress on quantity, not quality worked to their advantage. The Soviets did not\nwaste raw materials on a tank that wasn\u2019t built to last.\n\nThe T-34 spearheaded the counter-attack against the Nazis and won them many\nvictories despite the tank\u2019s low quality. Despite the advantages gained\nthrough the sheer quantity of T-34\u2019s, the crippling weakness of the tank often\ndisabled or at least slowed the Soviet counter-offensive. After the collapse\nof the Nazi forces in southern Russia, Soviet forces routed the Nazi armies as\nthey fled westward. During this series of assaults, the Soviets lost 701,474\ncasualties and 2,026 tanks \u2013 an astronomically high number for such a short\nterm and regional offensive. Aside from the tanks destroyed, many were left\nnonoperational due to stripped tracks and engine failure. Within six days, the\nSoviet 5th Guards Tank Army went from an initial strength of 542 tanks to a\nmere 111.^21 The unreliability and short lifespan of the T-34 disabled such\ntank divisions as they awaited reinforcements and performed tank maintenance\nthroughout the latter stages of the war. The average Soviet military operation\nof 15-20 days saw an overall tank loss rate of 82 percent.^22 This left the\nSoviet forces to remain idle and wait for reinforcements, or to soldier on and\nexpect an even higher mortality and tank loss rate given their depleted\nforces.\n\nIt is difficult to justify the T-34\u2019s high prestige in the eyes of Soviet,\nNazi and Allied forces throughout the war. The Soviet Union suffered\nextraordinary and unprecedented losses. Critical flaws in the T-34\u2019s design\nslowed the Soviet counter-offensive against the Nazis and resulted in higher\ncasualty rates. Despite this, the T-34 was viewed as a major factor in Soviet\nvictory over the Nazis by contemporary historians. As the praise and respect\ngiven the T-34 is clearly not due to its merits on the battlefield nor its\nexceptional quality, its legendary status must be attributed elsewhere. The\nT-34\u2019s role in inflicting a humiliating and total defeat on the Nazi invading\nforces, regardless of its effectiveness or quality had, by the end of the war,\nplaced the tank beyond reproach. The T-34 was a symbol of the sheer mass and\nwillpower of the Soviet Union: a nation that bore greater losses than any in\nhistory, yet still overwhelmed its enemies with boundless manpower and\nresources. As the exemplar of Soviet might, the T-34 managed to capture the\nimagination of soldiers of all nations, even as thousands of them lay in\nsmoldering heaps on the battlefield. All it took to immortalize the T-34 was a\ngreat deal of self-deception and sheer coincidence.\n\n  1. Edward A.

I did not know the truth behind the T-34. However,\nthe role that this small, ordinary and non-special tank in World War II is\nrecognizable. It is interesting to think, too, how history can be made up by\nthe dominant power or the dominant powers.

Its interesting to find out the soldiers\nin battle could not see when they were firing, so they had to trust their gut\nand go with their instinct. Very intriging article and cool to know about this\npart of WWll.\n\nreply\n\n05/11/2019\n\n8:55 pm\n\nNathaniel Bielawski\n\nI find it intriguing how the sheer numbers of the T-34 were able to defeat the\nquality and superiority of the Tiger tank. Perhaps it wasn\u2019t the tank itself\nbut the factories producing the T-34 that allowed the Soviet Union to\noverwhelm and defeat Germany. With an 84 percent casualty rate, I\u2019m surprised\nthat the T-34 received as much praise as it did considering how many were\nproduced.\n\nreply\n\n12/01/2020\n\n8:55 pm\n\nAiden Dingle\n\nI think that it\u2019s really interesting how the T-34 actually managed to push\nback the Germans and how the Germans actually regarded the T-34 as the reason\nfor why they were pushed back. Although the mass amount of T-34\u2019s did\ncontribute to the German\u2019s loss, I have no idea how the T-34\u2019s were even able\nto last long enough to repel an attack. The tank had massive disadvantages\nwhen compared to similar tanks from other countries around the world. But, the\nway that the USSR used the T-34 to overwhelm German forces was genius. The\nphilosophy of meeting the bare minimum to not waste resources and to maximize\nmanpower was a great tactic at the time, but I just can\u2019t imagine being a tank\ncrewman for a T-34, being essentially sent out to die with the equipment that\nthey had.\n\nreply\n\n02/02/2020\n\n8:55 pm\n\nTASI TA601B\n\nhmm, good points given, but perhaps too one-sided.\n\nreply\n\n13/06/2020\n\n8:55 pm\n\nIthamar\n\nMany of the problems with the T-34 could have been resolved with just a little\nbit more effort and quality control. For example, the engine was incredibly\ncrude with terrible air filters that needed a complete redesign. And in fact\nthis was recommended by the American engineers who examined the T-34 that was\nsent for testing at the Aberdeen proving ground. However, this wasn\u2019t really\ndone and the engines on the T-34 continued to break down due to this one issue\nalone. Another problem was the terrible heat treatment on the gear teeth of\nthe transmission. They were either too soft or too hard and brittle, and this\ncaused them to wear and break after a fairly short space of time. Then there\nwas the armour, which suffered from terrible spalling. This issue wasn\u2019t just\ndown just to poor metallurgy, as it was noticed that there was an issue with\nthe terrible quality control and heat treatment in Soviet factories. If the\nSoviets had made a bare minimum of effort to improve quality then the\neffectiveness of the T-34 would have been improved substantially.\n\nreply\n\n11/11/2020\n\n8:55 pm\n\nSantos Mencio\n\nThe T-34 is a tank that I simultaneously love and hate, I love it because it\u2019s\nso synonymous with the eastern front but I hate it because it really is a tank\nthat leaves much to be desired. It certainly is an impressive tank on paper\nand I think that it definitely contributes to the legend of the T-34.

After all, when dealing with an invading army whose\nideology consists of whipping out a large portion of your population just\nbecause you happened to have Slavic blood inside you, it\u2019s no surprise that\nthe Soviets didn\u2019t often have the skilled workers, nor the factories or\nmaterials necessary to make tanks of high quality.\n\nreply\n\n23/08/2021\n\n8:55 pm\n\nBen Kruck\n\nThe T-34\u2019s seem to have quite the reputation. It\u2019s poor design, weaponry,\narmor, rate of fire, and overall quality is one thing but being able to\noverwhelm the Nazi invasion with a sheer number of these tanks is something\nelse. Its flawed, yet somehow it worked. Overall, this was a great article to\nread, and I always love hearing about military history!\n\nreply\n\n26/08/2022\n\n8:55 pm\n\nSamuel Vega\n\nGabriel, I really enjoy stories about World War II. I particularly like\nstories how military weapons and how these weapons were used in the strategy\nof the war. You described in detail how the T-34 was used successfully used\nagainst the German defensive. There were flaws with the design of the tank;\nhowever the sheer size of the tank caused fear in the eyes of the enemy.\nWithout this tank, the outcome of the war might have been different.\n\nreply\n\n11/09/2022\n\n8:55 pm\n\n1 2\n\n# StMU Research Scholars\n\nA student organization of St. Mary\u2019s University of San Antonio, Texas,\nfeaturing scholarly research, writing, and media from students of all\ndisciplines.\n\n## Administrative\n\n  * Office of the President\n\n  * Office of the Provost\n\n  * College of Arts, Humanities, & Social Sciences\n\n  * Science, Engineering, & Technology\n\n  * Greehey School of Business\n\n  * Blume Library\n\n  * Rattler Success Center\n\n  * Academic Media Center\n\n  * Academic Technology Services\n\n## Departments\n\n  * Biology\n\n  * Communications Studies\n\n  * Elementary Education\n\n  * Environmental Science\n\n  * History\n\n  * Languages\n\n  * Philosophy\n\n  * Political Science\n\n  * Sociology\n\n## About\n\n  * About Us\n\n  * Our Archive\n\n  * Our Faculty Team\n\n  * Contact Us\n\n", "frontpage": false}
