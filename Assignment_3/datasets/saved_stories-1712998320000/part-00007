This topic encompasses a number of challenging and\ncontentious issues surrounding open source business models, licensing\nconflicts, and the complex dynamics between corporate interests and community-\ndriven projects.\n\n\u201cThe supply-side value of widely-used Open Source software is estimated to be\nworth $4.15 billion, and the demand-side value is much larger, at $8.8\ntrillion,\u201d OSI program coordinator Ariel Jolo said in the announcement. \u201cAnd\nyet, maintaining a healthy business while producing Open Source software feels\nmore like an art than a science.\u201d\n\nParticipants will have to apply to be part of the panel and OSI is soliciting\npitches on topics that are at the heart of the discussion of navigating the\ncomplex landscape of open source in business environments:\n\n  * How you balance the needs of paying customers with those of partners and non-paying users\n  * How you organize your sales, marketing, product and engineering teams to deal with your communities\n  * What makes you decide where to draw the lines between pushing fixes upstream and maintaining a private fork\n  * Where do you see the value of copyleft in software-as-a-service\n  * Why you chose a specific license for your product offering and how do you deal with external contributions\n  * What trends do you see in the ecosystem and what effects are these having\n\nThe challenges have recently been brought into sharp focus, following Redis\nInc\u2019s decision to abandon its open source licensing, blindsiding the majority\nof contributors who were deeply opposed to the decision. Redis cited the\nchallenges of monetizing open core software in the cloud era as the reason for\nthe shift away from open source, echoing Elasticsearch\u2019s move to a \u201cfauxpen\u201d\nsource license in 2021.\n\nIn a post on the AWS Open Source Blog, Amazon announced its support for the\nValkey fork and criticized Redis Inc\u2019s decision to move away from its open\nsource roots:\n\n> It\u2019s a mistake to undervalue the contributions of devoted users and\n> contributors who helped make Redis and other open source technologies what\n> they are today. When Redis was open source, the majority of commits may have\n> come from Redis employees in recent years, but many other contributors added\n> significant value to the project which should not be discounted \u2014 especially\n> considering the degree to which Redis employees also decided which\n> contributions to accept. Redis broke with the community that helped it grow\n> and left them stranded.\n\nOSI, as an advocate of open source, is looking to change the tides on this\ntrend of companies claiming that cloud providers have forced them into\nabandoning open source licensing.\n\n\u201cMost of these companies have reached the end of their Open Source\nexploitation cycle: they grew fast after they chose to use non-reciprocal Open\nSource licenses,\u201d OSI Executive Director Stefano Maffulli commented on the\ntrend. \u201cThese licenses like the BSD/MIT or the ASLv2.0 are basically donations\nto the commons, they don't require anything in exchange (they're often\nreferred to as \u2018permissive licenses.\u2019)\u201d\n\nReflecting on this pattern, Maffulli noted the strategic timing that often\ncoincides with key corporate milestones.\n\n\u201cAfter the propulsion of increased popularity granted by these licenses tapers\noff, predictably around the 10-years anniversary (right before or after their\nplanned IPO) they start to blame some external forces (either 'free riders' or\nanother excuse) to change the license revealing the truth: All they care about\nis to exclusively monetize the full value of their Open Source contributions,\u201d\nhe said.\n\nThis is where a few companies have discovered some of the distinct merits of\ncopyleft licensing. In pursuit of a way to replicate the MySQL business model,\nMaffulli said some companies accept reciprocity or discuss different licensing\noptions with the rights holder. This model requires a copyleft license from\nthe GNU GPL family or the Mozilla Public License.\n\n\u201cThese licenses are more complex, they're not well understood, they're also\nnot well explained and they were written when Software as a Service didn't\nexist,\u201d Maffulli said.\n\n\u201cThe FSF published a special version of GPLv3, called Affero GPLv3 to respond\nto SaaS but hasn't published a dedicated FAQ for it, rendering the\ninterpretation of the license even more complex.\n\n\u201cSome of the companies move away from Open Source claiming that there are no\nOpen Source Approved Licenses that force reciprocity in the SaaS environment:\nthis is the \u2018SaaS loophole.\u2019\u201d\n\nMaffulli said this call for papers is part of OSI\u2019s initiative to start a\nconversation aimed at removing the excuse of the SaaS loophole.\n\nOSI\u2019s leadership on this topic seeks to educate and advocate for licensing\nstrategies that ensure the spirit of open source is maintained even when\nsoftware isn't distributed in the traditional sense, protect the integrity of\nopen source projects, and foster a more sustainable ecosystem for OSS\ndevelopment, particularly in SaaS models.\n\nAnyone who runs a business producing Open Source products or whose company\u2019s\nrevenue depends on open source in any way is invited to submit a 300-word\nabstract for consideration. OSI will narrow it to five speakers who will also\ndevelop their ideas into a series of articles. Selected participants will join\nan online discussion during the summer, followed by a panel at All Things Open\nin Raleigh, NC, on October 29, 2024.\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\nGet notified when we publish new security blog posts!\n\n## Related posts\n\nBack to all posts\n\nProduct\n\n### Introducing Dependency Visualization: An Interactive Way to See\nDependencies at a Glance\n\nWe're introducing dependency visualization for reports - get a quick\nimpression of the state of your dependencies without getting lost in the\ndetails.\n\nBy Eli Insua - Apr 11, 2024\n\nSecurity News\n\n### Double Whammy: Change Healthcare Targeted Again by RansomHub Following\nALPHV's Exit Scam\n\nRansomHub claims to have over 4TB of sensitive data from the Change Healthcare\nransomware attack.
