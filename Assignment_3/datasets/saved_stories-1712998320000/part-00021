This investigation of the Russian\nT34/85 tank has provided a wealth of evidence to substantiate and explain the\nreputation for service- ability credited to 'this tank. This evidence falls\nunder the fol- lowing headings: 1. Virtually all parts were in operating\norder. 2. There had been a generous use of high alloy steels and other high\nquality materials. 3. Manufacturing methods had been adequate for the job,\nwith crude exterior finish being countered by precision machining on\nfunctioning parts, according to need. 4. Ball and roller bearings were widely\nused, there being 88 in all. 5. Engineering development had been very actively\ncontinued; it was evident that most of the changes found through the com-\nparison with the Aberdeen and German reports had probably been made to improve\ntank performance and especially tank service life, rather than to simplify or\nto reduce cost. B. While no accurate estimate of the probable cost of this\nvehicle can be made from the information available, it is believed that the\ncost at the time of manufacture, converted to U.S.A. currency, would exceed\n$50,000. C. The T34/85 tank examined was found to have many of the features\nregarded as important by American tank designers. This is brought out by the\nfollowing tabulation of the major advantages and disad- vantages of this tank,\nbased on a comparison between the findings of this investigation and a set of\nspecifications covering certain American tanks now in the course of design and\ndevelopment. 1. Desirable Features of the T34/85 Tank (a) Materials were found\nample for the job - better than those to be used in American tanks, in some\ninstances. (b) Accessibility for servicing was good, especially of engine\ncomponents and storage batteries from the fighting com- partment. Approved For\nRelease 2000/04/18 :-CAA-RDP81-01044FRM9, RQb7 c 1,-A L CONCApP d For Release\n2000/04/18 : CIA-RDP81-MAItbB6*96#bb01-4 (c) Plates containing operating\ninstructions were conveniently located throughout the vehicle. (d) Design was\nsimple to the degree that the average mechani- cally trained crewman could\nattempt repairs with some assurance of success. (e) Fire hazard was minimized\nthrough the use of a diesel engine rather than one requiring gasoline, and a\nmajor source of radio interference was eliminated. (f) Ventilation of the crew\ncompartment could be greatly augmented through the use of the, engine cooling\nfan. This method could be used during gun firing to keep bore gas\nconcentration in the fighting compartment at a minimum. (g) A safety switch\nwas provided in the gun firing circuit to prevent the gunner or commander from\nfiring the gun until the loader signified his readiness by setting this\nswitch. The switch was tripped by the gun during recoil. (h) The engine\ncrankcase breather tube was readily accessible from the fighting compartment,\nso that gasoline or other diluent could be added to the lubricating oil to\ninsure the starting of the engine in extremely cold weather. (i) The T34 is of\nlighter weight than the current U. S. medium tanks, but carries a gun only\nslightly smaller (85 mm vs. 90). (j ) Desirably low unit ground pressure of 10\nlbs./sq.in. - our current design goal. (k) Escape hatches were provided as\nconsidered desirable by U. S. designers. one in hull over driver, two in the\nturret, one in the floor under the machine gunner. (1) A machine gun was\nmounted coaxially with the tank gun, and another machine gun was mounted on\nthe turret for use against anti-aircraft as well as ground targets. (m) A\npistol port was provided on each side of the turret. (n) The turret could be\nrotated through 360? by power or by hand. Power traversing could be used for\nslewing, and C o ppI Pi t FbAlRelease 2000/04/18 : CIA-\nRDP81-01044R000100070001-4 f yoW&~ MIlpase 2000/04/18: CIA-RDP81-01044R000dO\nZOOR a quick shift to hand traversing could. be made for placing the sight and\ngun on target and for tracking a target. Turret position was indicated on an\nazimuth ring graduated from 0 to 60. (o) The flat sloping armor in the front\ncould be expected to provide desirable 'shell deflection properties. (p) Armor\nthicknesses were approximately the same as those used in U. S. tanks. (q) The\ncruising range could be expected to be 185 to 225 miles. This range was\nestimated by applying the Aberdeen finding of 150 to 187 miles for 120 gallons\nto the greater fuel tank capacity (147 gallons) found in the G812 tank. (r)\nThere was provision for both intercommunication and radio equipment; this\nequipment had probably been stripped from the tank in the field. (s) Lifting\nhooks had been provided on both turret and hull, and there were towing hooks\nfront and rear. (t) An auxiliary starting means - the compressed air starting\nsystem - may have been more necessary because of the use of a diesel engine,\nbut would be advantageous for gasoline engines as well, especially in very\ncold weather. (u) The engine and transmission could be removed and re-\ninstalled with a fair degree of ease, since there were a minimum of lines and\nno electric wires to disconnect. The use of aluminum alloys for all castings\nof any size, except the cylinder head covers, eased the lifting problem. A\nsmaller crane or hoist could be used than otherwise. Permanent lifting eyes\nwere provided on both engine and transmission. (v) Protective coatings seemed\nmost effective. Very little rusting or other corrosion was found on\nfunctioning parts, despite the fact that the tank had been shipped from Korea\nwithout any weatherproofing, and had stood outdoors through several weeks of\nrainy weather before examination. (w) Accessories not connected to the engine\nlubrication system were apparently expected, to run for life on the initial\nlubrication given in manufacture. There was no provision for adding oil or\ngrease to such accessories as the starter, generator, ventilating fan, and the\ntraversing motor..

Undesirable Features of the T34 Tank (a) Rough\nsteering due to the use of clutch and brake steering control, and (b)\nDifficulty in shifting due to the use of a spur gear clash- shift transmission\n(no synchronizers, no clutches) and a multi-disc dry clutch, undoubtedly make\ndriving this tank a difficult and very fatiguing job. (c) Rough ride under\nsome conditions, due to absence of shock absorbers, could contribute greatly\nto crew fatigue, as could (d) Probably excessive noise resulting from the\nsolid mounting of the engine in the hull (no rubber mountings) and the absence\nof mufflers. All-steel tracks contributed to this noise. (e) Ground clearance\nwas only 16\" (Aberdeen figure). This was two inches below that considered\nnecessary by the U. S. designers. (f) Power traversing could not be used for\nputting the gun on target, but only for slewing. Hand traversing had to be\nused for the final positioning on a fixed target, or for tracking a moving\ntarget. (g) All elevation was obtained by hand cranking. There was no\nprovision for power assist. (h) The liquid cooled engine and its attendant\nradiators made for greater vulnerability, due to loss of coolant because of\nconcussion, small arms fire, or freezing. (i) There was no basket platform in\nthe turret. Greater risk of injury during slewing was imposed on the turret\ncrew as the result. (j) Fire protection was poor, consisting of two hand\nextin- guishers containing pressurized carbon tetrachloride. The lingering\npoisonous vapor resulting from their use would be very likely to drive the\ncrew out of the tank before it could be cleaned out by ventilation. (k) There\nwere many gaps at the joints in the armor that could have allowed entry of\nbullet splash and shell frag- ments.

Note the item on ventilation, however,\nunder \"Desirable Features of the T34 Tank\" above. (m) The electrical system\nwas only partially waterproofed. Except for the generator, starter, and\nstarter relays, the electrical components could all be readily penetrated by\nwater, with resulting acceleration of corrosion and deterioration of\ninsulation. (n) No auxiliary engine - generator unit was provided to keep the\nbatteries charged or to supplement them, although only 100 ampere hour\nbatteries were used. The generator on the propulsion engine probably did not\nexceed the 75 ampere charging rate appearing on the ammeter as a full scale\nreading. (o) No provision was found for heating the oil as an aid to starting\nin extremely cold weather, although other measures had been taken, such as the\nprovision of the compressed air starting system and of access to the crankcase\nbreather tube for the adding of gasoline or other diluent. (p) (q) All the\nlubricating oil in the two oil reservoir tanks and all the coolant in the\nradiator cores, as well as in the engine had to be drained or be spilled into\nthe hull when the engine was removed from the vehicle. No shut-off valves were\nprovided, and no shut-off couplings. The connections to be opened were all\nrubber hoses held in place by screw clamps. Expanded beads had been provided\nat the steel tubing ends to keep the hoses from slipping off. The seals on\nrotating shafts throughout the vehicle were for the most part simply felt or\nfabric packing rings, generally without conical compressors, springs, or other\nmeans of insuring continued close contact with the shaft. The only lip-type\nseal found was in the fuel injection pump. There were no carbon seals. (r)\nWholly inadequate engine intake air cleaners could be expected to allow early\nengine failure due to dust intake and the resulting abrasive wear. Several\nhundred miles in very dusty operation would probably be accompanied by severe\nengine power loss.

The tank\nappeared to require only track and charged batteries to put it in operation,\nthough other equipment such as radio, intercommunication system, and machine\nguns had also been removed. The spare engine would have been ready to run\nafter the flushing out of the vaseline-like grease used as a corrosion\ninhibitor. Detailed examination revealed that most parts were in excellent\ncon- dition, with no likelihood of early failure. The exceptions are listed in\nAppendix 15, \"Failures\". Most important among these were the transmission and\nfinal drive, - inadequate in design, and the front suspension members, - a\nmanufacturing and inspection slip-up. Com- ment on the condition of individual\nparts has been included in the descriptive material accompanying the pictorial\nsection of this report.

Ample\nsupplies of high grade material, including alloy steel consti- tuents that\nmight have been critical, were made available to the tank manufacturing\nprogram at the time the G812 tank was built - late in 1945. All materials\nanalyses were made on the 1945 tank components, none of the 1948 engine parts\nbeing so tested.' There was no evidence under visual inspection of the parts\nof the later engine that suggested any substitutions had been made. The later\nengine had even more aluminum, in the three cast aluminum cooling fans added\nto the generator. Furthermore, the aluminum samples tested indicated virgin\nmetal or the equivalent 'rather than secondary metal. The materials provided\nfor the tank program had been wisely used, not extravagantly. Alloying\nmaterials had been effectively used to obtain toughness along with the desired\nhardness. The armor, for example, was much harder than our specifications call\nfor, yet at the same time tougher. In general, the accompanying heat treatment\nseemed equally well suited to requirements, and control seemed quite\nsatisfactory judging from the extensive hardness data obtained for this study.\nDepartures from optimum materials treatment seemed likely to be the result of\nproduction imperfection rather than any lack of understanding. The inadequate\ndrawing of the case-hardened trans- mission gears was an example. Examination\nof rubber parts - natural and synthetic - again indicated a clear\nunderstanding of the special properties of the several types used. Heavy\nloading with fillers and resulting loss of physical properties - tensile\nstrength and service life, especially, - sug- gested the possibility of\nshortage of synthetic rubber stocks, both of the neoprene and the buna types.\nPlastics parts, the few that were found, were made of materials known in\ncommercial practice for many years, materials that varied from poor to\nexcellent in quality yet were regarded as adequate for the job in every\napplication.

There was much evidence of comprehensive\nand detailed knowledge of modern manufacturing techniques. The following are\nindications: 1. Excellent castings, both steel and aluminum. Castings were\ngenerally found to be quite sound, free from blow holes and sand inclusions,\nand well filled out, though non-functioning surfaces were frequently found\nconspicuously rough. 2. Generally good heat treating, including nitriding and\ncarburizing as well as through-hardening. Maximum surface hardness had been\nreached in many of the carburized parts, e.g., 67 Rockwell C on the oil pump\nidler gear. 3. Use of several types of welding technique, both manual and\nmachine, including the submerged arc process. 4. Skillful handling of the\nplates used in the multiple plate clutches, to result in their staying flat in\nservice. Cross rolling of the stock and careful grinding are required to\nprevent warping when the clutch is heated during slipping. 5. High grade\nfinishes and close tolerances held on such parts as the fuel injection pump\nplungers and barrels and the rack and pinions. The injection nozzles and the\nair starter dis- tributor also offered such examples. 6. High quality engine\nvalve springs, free from seams and die marks and otherwise smooth-surfaced,\nand zinc plated despite the risk of hydrogen embrittlement. 7. Ground worms\nwith smooth, chatter-free finish were found in the turret traversing and gun\nelevating mechanisms. B. Knowledge and understanding of manufacturing methods\nwere some- times not matched by execution in actual production. For example,\n1. The aluminum castings were generally very good. The sand castings, however,\nsuffered from unskilled molding technique, from soft ramming, inferior mixes,\nand rough handling of cores. There were many instances of core wire and sand\ninclusions. The permanent mold castings were admirably clean, free of blow\nholes, and well filled out. However, im- proper closing of the molds had\nresulted in heavy parting lines and flash, requiring much extra cleanup work,\na hand job (snagging) that was crudely done.

Heat treatment, found very\neffectively controlled in most parts tested, was imperfectly controlled in the\nall-important trans- mission gears where insufficient drawing of the case had\nre- sulted in excessive surface cracking under load. This con- tributed to\ntransmission failure, though perhaps of secondary importance. The lower\nsloping front armor plate on the hull had been poorly quenched or tempered,\nthe temperature having been too low. The upper plate was found properly\ntreated. 3. Knowledge of various welding techniques was not matched by welding\nskill; many cracks were found in and under the hull welds, some seriously\nweakening the joint. Most of the manual. welds were very rough and irregular\nin appearance, adding to the impression of a low order of skill. 4. Lack of\nskill in flame cutting had apparently been the reason for the grinding of the\ncorners of the driver's hatch opening. C. Manufacturing equipment was being\nrun at capacity or overloaded, judging from the plentiful evidence of\nextremely course feeds, severe chatter, and tearing and rubbing of machined\nsurfaces. In- adequate machine maintenance and the running of tools much\nbeyond the optimum point for resharpening could have contributed materi- ally.\nIt should be emphasized again, however, that low grade machining was\nessentially confined to stock removal, to the pro- vision of clearance space.\nMating surfaces were machined with much greater care, though even this\nmachining was frequently compared unfavorably with American workmanship. D.\nExamination of the G812 tank parts suggests the following picture of\nmanufacturing equipment committed in 1945 to the T34/85 tank program: 1. The\nlargest casting required of the foundry facilities was the turret, weighing\nabout 9,000 pounds. , Problems of casting technique and equipment had been\nsimplified by the building up of the hull from a number of cast and rolled\ncomponents. Even the turret roof was found to be a separate piece welded on.\n2. Demands on armor plate rolling equipment had also been eased by the built-\nup hull construction. No bent plates were used, nor had the plates been taper-\nrolled. 3. Considerable use was made of closed die forgings. The crank- shaft\nand the four camshafts were so formed, the former requiring at least a 25,000\npound hammer. .

Stampings and\ndrawn parts were more widely used in the G812 tank than in the T34 on which\nthe Aberdeen Report had been based. The fuel tanks were among the largest\nparts so made, being built by welding two. drawn halves together rather than\nby welding up flat stock as was formerly done. 5. Molded and laminated\nplastics parts found on this tank could have been made with. the simplest and\ncrudest equipment. The generator and fuel injection pump coupling discs, the\nvalve knobs, and the molded battery cases are examples. 6. There was no\nevidence of any unusual ? machining equipment being required. The heavier\nmachining could all have been done with conventional horizontal lathes and\nmills, vertical lathes and mills, drill presses, and other pieces of standard\nequipment. Machine tools used in railroad equipment manu- facture could well\nhave been applied to the job. There was no definite indication of gang\nmachining; it was difficult to say whether the many flange holes in the\ntransmission case were drilled successively or simultaneously. It was clear,\nhowever, that extensive use had been made of drill jigs. 7. Shapers and\nhobbing equipment had been used for the ma- chining of most of the gears. The\nspiral bevel gears used at the input of the transmission had required a\nspecial gear generating machine. The worms used in the turret traversing and\ngun elevating mechanisms had required a thread grinder and probably also a\nthread mill. Hand polishing of the connecting rods. Hand finishing of the cam\nnoses on the four camshafts in each engine. Hand grinding at the driver's\nhatch to dress up rough flame cutting. Extensive hand snagging of aluminum\ncastings to make up for poor mold closure and the resulting heavy seams.\nBreaking of edges on many machined. parts. Hand welding of the fuel tanks,\nsuggesting the lack of seam welding equipment.

A small American-made end wrench was one of the few exceptions. Hand\nhammering and bending of small sheet metal parts the hollow chamber found : in\nthe engine cooling system, for. example, and the radiator top tanks. Yet a\nfailure. to machine sufficient clearance at the clevis root of the front\nsuspension spring arms had not been caught by in- spection. As the result,\nboth front suspension spring guide rods had been bent and had worn severely.\nThe sticking of these bent rods in their bushings could have caused loss of\ntrack tension and consequently loss of track. It is not known whether the\ntrack had actually been lost before the tank was captured. No cooling tests\nwere run on the G812 tank, but earlier data had indicated insufficient\nradiator cooling capacity. It was therefore of particular interest to note\nthat the exceptionally poor soldering job that had been done on the radiator\ncore fins and tubes on the G812 tank had not been rejected by inspection (or\nthat these radi- ators had been used despite rejection). As the result of this\npoor soldering, the fin-to-tube contact was probably less than 10% of that\nobtainable. By the most conservative estimate, the G812 radiators had much\nless than 50% of the capacity that could have been reached through the\ncorrection of just this one manufacturing operation.

These were the six\nAmerican-made bearings, identified as having been manufactured during the\nWorld War II Lend-Lease period. Ball bearings comprised, 54 of the total, the\nother 34 being roller bearings including needle bearings. All bearings are\nlisted in Appendix 6, being described by application or location and by size.\nAlso included is a breakdown by types - thrust, self-aligning, etc. Eight of\nthe roller bearings were tested for geometry and finish as well as material,\nand one of these was given a controlled life test. This work was done by Their\nreport, included as Appendix 7, indicates that the bearing un er life test\nfailed after only 14 hours under conditions expected to produce few failures\nat 300.hours in comparable- bearings. The eight had been found to conform to\nAmerican practice so far as metallurgy, surface finish, and geometry were\nconcerned. It was surmised that residual stresses may have been responsible\nfor the premature failure.

The 37\nitems listed under \"Design Changes\", Appendix 17, suggest active continuation\nof engineering development of the T34 tank in the two to three' years between\nthe manufacture of the T34/85 tank examined in this study and the T34/76\nstudied for the Aberdeen Report, aside from the obvious change in armament.\nThe G812 engines were both provided with many improvements over the engines\ndescribed in the Aberdeen and German Reports. B. Most of this continued\ndevelopment seemed directed toward prod- uct improvement, especially toward\nincrease in the tank's service life. The following are illustrative: 1. Cast\nsteel bogie wheels with solid tires, rather than drawn steel wheels with\nperforated tires. 2. 3\" turret wall thickness, rather than 2\". 3. Higher\ncapacity generator. 4. Improved generator drive coupling. 5. Improved water\npump drive coupling. 6. Lighter water pump impeller. 7. Better lubrication of\nthe water pump bearing. 8. Fuel tank capacity increase of 23%. 9. Better fuel\ntanks - less welding. 10. Greater air cleaner capacity. However, the higher\ndirt removal efficiency intended was probably not achieved. 11. Better\nlubrication of the engine accessory drive. 12. A large filter, rather than\nmerely an oil strainer, for the lubricating oil. Among the changes listed\nabove were corrective measures for virtually all the T34 defects revealed in\nthe course of the tests run at Aberdeen in 1943 (see the Aberdeen Report). The\nonly important defects not so recognized were the lack of shock ab- sorbers -\nthe G812 tank had no shock absorbers - and the trans- mission deficiencies.\nApproved For Release 2000/04/18 :-CAA-RDP81-01044Fj~0OWkriL oqwgaeror Release\n2000/04/18: CIA-RDP81-01 AVMb 0 ffl -4 C. Not all of the changes made were\nsuccessful. It is very doubtful that any improvement in air cleaning\nefficiency was obtained when the old air cleaner over the engine intake\nmanifolds was replaced with the two tractor-type cleaners. The latter had the\nsame general appearance as American tank air cleaners, but could be expected\nto have very inferior efficiency. Centrifugal separation of dirt from air was\nabandoned several decades ago in America as being very ineffective in motor\nvehicle application. With this serious defect combined with the low cooling\nefficiency due to poor radiator soldering, this tank would have made a very\npoor showing in operation in hot dusty country. D. Changes included some for\nthe convenience of the crew. An over- center spring for the main clutch\nreduced the foot pedal pressure required to disengage it. Better arrangement\nof the, engine instru- ment panel made it easier to reach controls without\nerror and to read the meters. Bringing the two starter controls together\nfacili- tated using the air starter to supplement the electric starter and to\nuse it only as long as was needed. New instruction plates were offered for\ncrew guidance and were very brief and to the point. E. As noted under \"Design\nChanges\", there were a few differences between the two G812 engines, including\nthe improvement in the lubrication of the lower accessory drive. That the\nolder engine found in the tank was as nearly like the service replacement\nengine suggests the possibility that the older engine had been rebuilt to\nbring it more nearly up to date.

The liner sleeves are sealed at the lower end by rubber rings. Natural\nrubber is used to make the water seal rings and a neoprene-type synthetic\nrubber is used for the oil seal rings. These rings are slid, between the liner\nand the cylinder block until they come to a stop against a shoulder on the\nliner, and are com- pressed into this space when the block is bolted to the\nupper crankcase. Note the triangular pads near the bottom of the cylinder\nblock at each end. The pad shown at the right of the photograph was used to\nprovide connection for water from the water pump. The pad at the left was\nsimply covered and served no purpose on this engine. It appeared as though the\nblock was made symetrical in this respect to be used as either _a right- hand\nor a left-hand block. It seems surprising, however, that all machining was\ncompleted so that studs and a cover plate had to be provided. The cylinder\nblock is made of a silicon-aluminum alloy. The perma- nent mold, sand core\nmethod of casting is used. The cylinder liners are made of a nitralloy.steel\nand..are nitrided on the inside and zinc plated on the water side. Four\ncylinder liners removed from engine - were gauged for uniformity of bore.\nExcellence of machining and freedom from wear are indicated by these\nmeasurements. The measurements are contained in the accompanying table. This\ntable reveals only small variation due to taper and out-of-roundness in the\nliners. checked. Taper of the top three inches, a possible measure of wear\nsuch as might have been accelerated by dust passing through the air cleaners,\nwas very slight. None of the liners showed any appreciable scoring or other\nlocal wear. If the 741 km shown on the vehicle odometer was correct, it would\nbe likely that very little dusty operation of the engine occurred. 25X1 B\nApproved For Release 2000/04/18 CIA-RDP81-0104eF 1 j%_W9Qc4 ENGINE\nCONFIDENTIAL Approved For Release 2000/04/18 : CIA-RDP81-01044R000100070001-4\n~fc Cd CV 4) .-r E cd W r-L H N M 00 Co O r-I O O N ri co O O ri O V V 00 m cJ\nO3 co aD co O O O O O O co L co O O O N O ?CD co O O O O 00 O) O O O ri co Co\nco CD CO L'- Co tf) O O O O 0 O O O O O O O O O LLB Lf) Lf) IL Lt LCi LO LC; O\nL6 L6 m c Lf) N C- L - (D O O O O O3 N . co; Co O O` a) O O LCD Lt) tf) O co\nL` L -- C) O O cn 1w V O co p O o) O dt Lf) L Q) O O o O O tom- C- t - O O O O\nO co co co N N O O O O co co m r-4 uj to co C.0 L- L- O O O O O O O O Q) O Lf)\ntf) U LC LC N co L`- t- O O O O co m L- L- O O O O LC) ?

The pistons had five rings. Two of them were\ncompression type and three were oil seal rings. All rings were 2.5 mm in\nheight. The piston top was curved to improve fuel distribution and combustion.\nThe lower edges of the two bottom oil ring grooves were chamfered and drilled\nto permit oil scraped from the cylinder walls to collect and return to the\ncrankcase. The underside of the piston top was finned, probably to aid in\ncooling and to give strength to the piston top. The piston pin bosses were\nrecessed on the outside to reduce weight and small holes were drilled through\nto the inside of the piston to return collected oil to the crankcase. The\npiston was pinned to the connecting rod with a hollow steel pin. This pin was\na press fit in the piston bosses at room temperature. Piston pin bosses were\ndrilled to permit oil to reach the pin. This indicates that the pin may have\nbeen intended to float at operating temperatures. The connecting rod bushing\nwas a running fit. Piston pins and the cylinder walls were lubricated by oil\nthrown from the crankshaft. Pistons shown in the German report had six rings.\nThe ring that was later omitted was a 5 mm oil scraper ring that had been\nlocated im- mediately above the piston pin bosses. The Aberdeen tank had five\nrings. The auxiliary rod was pinned to the main rod by a hollow steel pin,\nwhich was pressed in and held in place by a large cap-type screw. This screw\nwas locked to prevent loosening by a thin brass washer with a tab which was\nbent up into a notch in the screw head. Any tendency of the screw to loosen\nwould not meet much resistance from the brass washer. Considering the tendency\nof the Russians to securely lock every nut and bolt that could possibly come\nloose, it is peculiar that. they should depend upon this type of lock for such\nan important application as a connecting rod pin. The main rod bearing cap was\nfastened to the rod by six studs. The studs were screwed into the connecting\nrod and were then drilled and pinned to lock them. The nuts and bearing caps\nwere marked after assembly to indicate how far the nuts should be screwed down\n(if the engine is later overhauled) to obtain the same torque setting that was\noriginally used. The nuts were machined all over and were individually\nnumbered to cor- respond with numbers on the bearing cap so that, if the\nengine is later overhauled, the nuts can be returned to the same studs they\nwere removed from. Nuts were locked by cotterpins. Approved For Release\n2000/04/18 : CIX-RDP81-01044RM'I'b6ba'_ 4A L Co N F! D N TI AL Approved For\nRelease 2000/04/18 : CIA-RDP81-01044R000100070001-4 Engine Piston and\nConnecting Rod Assembly The pistons and piston pin plugs were made of a\nsilicon-aluminum alloy. The connecting rods, pins, and bearing caps were of\nsteel. Piston rings were cast iron and bearings were of copper alloys. The\nconnecting rods were forged, machined all over and hand polished. The pistons\nwere also forged. Part of the inside of the piston skirt had been milled,\nprobably to help balance the assemblies and reduce their over- all weight. The\nmilling was not evenly done, the result being uneven wall thicknesses on\nopposite sides of the piston skirt. Dimensional checks on several pistons\nrevealed such random variation in wall thickness as to indicate that this\nunevenness was not intentional. The piston diameter was 150 mm and height was\n120 mm. The piston pin bushing on the main connecting rod and both bushings on\nthe auxiliary rod were cast bronze and were held in the rod bores with hollow\nrivets. The main connecting rod bearings were steel backed lead copper\ninserts. The piston pin plugs were turned from silicon-aluminum bar stock.\nThey were not fastened to the piston pin, but floated loosely between the pin\nand the cylinder wall. The main connecting rod assembly could not be easily\nremoved from the upper crankcase because openings in the crankcase were not\nlarge enough to permit passage of either the piston or the large end of the\nmain rod. To remove one of the main rod assemblies, it would be necessary to\n(1) pull the piston pin, separate the piston from the rod, and remove the rod\nthrough the bottom; or (2) remove three of the six stads at the large end of\nthe connecting rod and remove the assembly through the top. Before the studs\ncan be removed, however, it is necessary to drill out the pins that lock them.\nAll parts in the assembly were well made and, judging from the number of\ninspection stamps, had been carefully inspected. It is apparent that the\nRussians had recognized the need for dependability of these ;parts and had\nmade them with extreme care to provide that dependability. Pistons and\nbearings showed very little wear on either engine.

The valve adjustment is made\nby screwing the tappet in or out of the hollow valve stem. The tappet is\nlocked by a serrated disc, which is splined to the valve stem and held in\ncontact with the tappet by the valve spring. On the spare engine the valves\nwere locked to prevent rotation by ears or lugs on each end of the larger\nvalve spring which fitted into notches in the cylinder head and the tappet\nlock. The engine removed from the tank was not provided with this anti-\nrotation device, and the valves were allowed to turn freely. Even on that\nengine, however, it appeared as though the valves did very little turning,\nhaving moved only two or three times in the life of the engine. Apparently\nthis movement was an occasional jump rather than a steady rotation. 25X1 B The\nvalves and tappets were forged steel. Valve sprin s,on the spare engine were\nzinc plated and on engine were oxide coated. We ves appeared to be well made,\nexcept that threads in tappets and valves did not fit well.

The exhaust camshaft is driven from the spur\ngear. Timing of the individual camshafts is provided for by splined sleeves\nbetween the camshafts and -driving gears. The sleeve is held in place by a\nnotched head bolt and can be backed out, allowing the sleeve and camshaft to\nturn while the gear remains stationary. The gears are located concentrically\non the camshaft by riding on the shoulders provided. The splines are therefore\nsubjected to torque load only. Oil is supplied to the hollow center of these\ncamshafts through the large hole in the journal nearest the gears, which\nreceives oil through a groove in its bearing. There is a continuous discharge\nof oil from each of the individual cams and at each of the other six bearing\njournals on each camshaft. The oil feed holes are .040 inches in diameter. The\nindividual cams are alike on all four camshafts but are located differently on\nexhaust and intake camshafts because of different rotation directions. Valve\nlift provided by the cams is .510 inches. The tachometer drive is driven from\nthe right intake camshaft through a tongue provided on the front oil plug,\nwhich fits into a slot on the tachometer drive input shaft. The camshafts were\nforged roughly to shape before machining. They were case hardened on the cam\nsurfaces only.

The tanks were filled from outside the\nhull, through armor- plate-covered access openings. The tank inlets were\ncovered by removable caps. These caps were also pressure relief valves. Output\nlines from the two tanks joined and supplied oil to the hand operated oil pump\nand the high pressure bank of the engine operated oil pump. The engine\noperated oil pump forced the oil through the oil 'filter to the oil manifold\non the front of the engine, at a pressure regulated by a built-in relief\nvalve. The oil filter also had a pressure relief valve, to by-pass oil in case\nthe filter element became plugged. The oil manifold distributed the oil to the\nvarious engine components and to the crankshaft journals. The oil, after\nlubricating the various engine parts, was drained to the crankcase. The two\nlow pressure banks of the oil pump received the oil from the crankcase and\npumped it to the scavenge oil control valve, which directed it either to the\noil filter and engine or to the oil radiator. Oil from the radiator was then\npiped back to the supply tanks.

The. scavenge oil control valve provides this selective control. The\npump is located under the lower crankcase near the front of the engine and is\ndriven from the same accessory drive train that drives the fuel transfer pump\nand water pump. High pressure supply is provided to the oil filter by the\nlowest gear bank of the pump. Pressure is controlled by an adjustable pressure\nrelief valve. The other two banks provide the low pressure oil supply to the\nradiator. The uppermost bank removes oil from the front of the crank- case and\nthe middle bank input is connected to a sump at the rear of the crankcase.\nSump draining is thus provided for, during operation at an angle. The low\npressure inlets are covered by a perforated metal screen, which could be\nexpected to remove only large chips of metal. The Aberdeen report showed a cup\nshaped screen which covered the entire pump top. The screen on both G812 pumps\ncovered only the. inlet port. In the pump from engine conventional square keys\nconnected the driving shaft to its gears. In the pump from engine flat keys\nwere used instead. All body members of the pump are permanent mold silicon-\naluminum alloy castings. All other parts are steel, except for the copper-\nalloy bush- ings in the driven gears, which turn on a fixed shaft. The pump is\neasily reached for servicing. A plate in the hull bottom can be removed from\nbeneath the tank, exposing the oil pump for easy removal.

ENGINE LUBRICATION SYSTEM HAND OPERATED OIL PUMP This small\npiston-type pump receives oil from the oil tanks and supplies it to the oil\nmanifold on the front of the engine. The pump is hand operated and is of such\nsmall capacity that it would be of little use in the event of failure of the\nengine driven oil pump. It could, however, be used to pump oil to the engine\nbefore it is started, thus insuring enough lubrication to avoid scoring and\nscuffing. The pump is located at the rear of the fighting compartment and\nwould be operated by the fighting crew rather than the driver or machine\ngunner. The pump body is made of cast iron. The piston is of cast iron or\nsteel and is provided with two felt rings. The pump valves are two spring\nloaded ball checks.

A pressure relief was provided to by-pass oil if the filter became\nclogged. The filter elements were of the edge-type, being formed by winding a\nnarrow brass strip edgewise into a closely packed helix. Depressions rolled\ninto the strip provided clearance space of .0032-.0040 inches for the oil to\npass through. The lands which were allowed to remain between the rolled\ndepressions served to space the successive turns of the helix. The oil filter\nassemblies on the two G812 engines differed slightly. 25X1 B Both had sand\ncast aluminum-alloy filter housings, but the methods of sup- port of the wound\nhelix were different. In the filter from engine the inner wall of each element\nwas formed by the cast aluminum cylinder on which the ribbon was wound. Ribs\ncast on the outside of these aluminum cylinders provide oil flow space. The\ninner wall of each element in the 25X1 B filter from engine - was formed of a\ncorrugated fiber-like paper cylinder. The German report describes a \"light\nalloy oil filter\" consisting of a sieve circuit with 20 circular sieves\nthrough which the lubricating oil flows. They also give the total filtering\nsurface area as 800 square centimeters, or 52 square inches. The two G812\nfilters each had a total filter area of 215 square inches. The filters\nmentioned in the German and Aberdeen reports were mounted on bosses cast\nintegrally with the lower crankcase. The filters on the G812 engines were\nmounted on cast iron brackets which bolted to the upper crankcase. Two of the\nbosses on the lower crankcase formerly used for the oil filter now support the\nwater pump lubrication assembly.

This\ntank is provided with a by-pass pressure relief valve to permit oil to go from\ninlet directly through the tank to the outlet, in case the radiator becomes\nplugged. Pressure in the oil radiator would probably be quite low, since only\nthe resistance of oil flow through it would create back pressure. The radiator\nis supplied from the low pressure, high capacity side of the oil pump. The\ncooling area of the oil radiator is approximately 500 square inches. The core\nis 1-5/8 inches thick and capacity of the radiator was 3.3 quarts.

When the latter connection is established, the sump\npumps operate at engine oil pressure, control being provided only by the\npressure relief valve that normally serves the oil pressure bank in the oil\npump. This provision of recirculating the sump oil can serve to accelerate the\nadequate supply of oil to all points in the engine when first starting and to\nspeed the warming-up of the engine. The valve body is brass. The valve plug is\nsteel, as are the con- necting tubes brazed to the body. After the tubes were\nbrazed in place, the valve body and tube assembly was lead dipped. There is no\nlead on the inner surface, however, and the steel plug works directly in the\nbrass body.

The connection to this port in\nthe crankcase was made through a drilled passage added to the oil manifold,\nrequiring no outside piping in this case. The other major oil feed lines were\nprovided by outside pipes, however, with all of the attendant risk of the\ndeveloping of a leak under the severe vibration encountered.

The high pressure air\n(1000 psi) comes from two storage cylinders in the hull. Steel tubing is used\nfor all connections to and from the air distributor. Check valves located at\nthe. tubing fittings leading into the cylinder heads prevent reverse flow of\ncombustion products when the cylinders begin to fire. The distributor is\ninterposed in the drive train leading to the fuel in- jection pump. It is\ntimed by the use of a drive bushing that is splined both internally and\nexternally to permit differential adjustment. This timing setting also affects\nthe fuel injection pump, since the drive to this pump Is through the\ndistributor. An adjustment for the injection pump alone can then be made at\nthe coupling joining the pump to the distributor. The rotary slide valve is\nspring loaded. There is no seal other than provided by the metal-to-metal fit,\nwhich is excellent. About 120 degrees duration is provided for air injection,\nthe valve opening occurring at about 6 degrees before top center. This\ndistributor, with its bevel gear drive, is provided with pressure lubrication\nthrough a drilled channel. The shaft to the injection pump is provided with a\nspiral groove intended as an oil retainer. The distributor housing and cover\nare aluminum alloy sand castings. The steel shaft at the output to the\ninjection pump runs directly on the casting. The gears are shaper-cut. The\ninternal and external splines serving to provide differential adjustment for\ntiming were very well ma- chined. The mating faces of the rotary valve parts\nwere very smoothly ground. They showed virtually no wear.

This gear, although splined, is not\ntightly fastened to the crankshaft but is permitted to slide on the splines in\ncase end play of the crankshaft occurs. The gear is retained by accessory\ndrive gears in front and by a hardened forged steel plate at the rear. The\nplate is provided with passages to permit oil leaking past the first main\nbearing to escape to the crankcase. The generator drive (items 2, 3, and 4)\nconsists of a series of bevel gears and shafts. The two shafts run on aluminum\nalloy bearings. The final output shaft . to the generator has a helical groove\nmachined in it to help reduce the amount of oil that leaks past the bearing.\nNo other seal is provided here. The speed ratio of generator to engine is 1.5\nto 1. The upper accessory drive shaft assembly (item 5) is supported at the\ntop by an aluminum alloy bearing and at the bottom by a self-aligning, double\nball bearing. The lower bevel gear runs on the main accessory drive gear. The\nsmaller bevel gear, near the middle of the shaft and made integrally with the\nshaft, drives the camshafts. The upper gear drives the air starter distributor\nwhich is, in turn, coupled to the fuel injection pump and governor. The\ncamshafts, air starter, distributor, fuel injection pump, and governor all run\nat 0.5 engine speed. The bevel gear shaft (item 10) is splined to the spur\ngear shaft below it (item 15) which drives the water pump, oil pump, and fuel\ntransfer pump. Both shafts run on aluminum alloy bearings cast integral with\nthe lower crankcase. The water pump (item 14) is coupled directly to the gear\nand runs at 1.5 engine speed. An idler gear (item 13) to drive the fuel\ntransfer pump is driven by the spur gear. The idler gear consists of two\nparts; a spur gear and a smaller bevel gear pressed into the hollow spur gear.\nAnother bevel gear, coupled directly to the fuel transfer pump, is driven by\nthe first bevel gear. Fuel transfer pump speed is 0.7857 engine speed. The oil\npump (item 17) is driven through an idler gear (item 16) which is supported by\na ball bearing. The oil pump is driven at 1.725 engine speed. All bevel gears\nare adjusted laterally with steel washers or, when the gear shaft runs on a\nremovable bearing, paper gaskets. All gears checked were made of Krupp steel.\nNo failures or signs of failures were noted on these gears on either engine\nexamined. The life of the lower gears may have been greatly lengthened by the\naddition of the lubricating oil connection provided, by the newer oil manifold\ndescribed earlier. The fact ' remains, however, that the gears from the older\nengine, which was not provided with this extra oil connection, were also in\nexcellent condition.

The\npressure on the discs is relieved (to disengage the clutch) by compressing the\nsprings with a ball and ramp arrangement. The drive discs are serrated on\ntheir outer edge to match similar serrations on the inner surface of the outer\nclutch drum. The driven discs are serrated on their inner edge and fit over\nteeth machined on the outer surface of the driven drum. The clutch output drum\nis splined to a flange which bolts to another flange splined to the\ntransmission input pinion. The Aberdeen report had indicated difficulty with\nclutch slippage. There was no evidence on the G812 tank that the main clutch\nor the final drive clutches had been slipping unduly. On most of the clutch\ndiscs, it was possible to see the original Blanchard-type grinding marks. The\ndisc internal and external diameters had been lathe turned and teeth appeared\nto be shaper cut. The fan is constructed of sheet steel parts, riveted\ntogether. The fan in the G812 tank was found to have the diameter of 35-1/2\ninches. The Germans reported a fan diameter of 872 mm or 34-3/8 inches. The\nGerman report also describes the 30 blades as being 182 mm or 7-3/16 inches\n\"high\". The G812 fan blades, also 30 in number, are 6-3/8 inches wide. The\nwidth of the entire fan and flange assembly (without ring gear) was found to\nbe 8-5/8 inches. If this were the dimension the German article referred to, it\ncould mean that the G812 tank had a larger fan. The starter ring gear was\nbolted to the rear of the fan. The com- plete assembly was apparently then\nbalanced by drilling metal from the ring gear flange. The edge of the ring\ngear was marked all the way around with angular designations, probably to aid\nin timing the camshafts and injection pump. The assembly is splined to the\nengine crankshaft and can go on only one way, because of a missing spline\ntooth and a matching obstruction on the crankshaft spline.

The purpose of the injection pump is to deliver,\nunder high pressure, a metered volume of fuel oil to the cylinder at the\nprecise time for most efficient combustion. The amount of fuel to be delivered\nis regulated through small valves in the pump by the ball-type governor\nattached to the rear of the injection pump. 25X1 B The pump appears to be\nfairly well made and, although inferior to U. S. products in general overall\nquality and a earance entirely adequate for the application. The pump examined\nwas comparable to an American made pump after approximately 3500 hours of\nservice. It was estimated that the life of this pump would be 1000 hours. The\ncamshaft was supported by two ball bearings (one at each end) and five two-\npiece aluminum bearings uniformly spaced along the camshaft with two cam lobes\nbetween bearings. This is a more rigid support than is usual in U. S.\npractice. The tappet rollers had needle bearings. U. S. practice is to use a\nloose steel sleeve-type ' bearing between the tappet pin and the tappet\nrollers. A desirable feature found on this pump and not common on U. S. pumps\nis the provision in the design of the control sleeves to permit the removal of\nthe plunger from the top of the pump. Fuel is fed into both ends of the pump\nto insure adequate supply to all cylinders. The rear fuel supply line is also\nconnected to an air bleed valve to remove air entrapped in the fuel system.\nFuel leakage past the nozzle valves and plungers is drained into the crankcase\nwhere it mixes with the engine lubrication oil. Lubrication of the pump after\ninstallation (before leakage provides fuel oil lubrication) is evidently\nprovided by pouring a small amount of oil into the camshaft compartment. An\noil level dip- stick was provided on the pump to check for the presence of\nthis oil before the engine was first started. Apparently, this dipstick was\nnever used after the first oil supply was established. The dipstick location\nwas not the same on the two G812 pumps (see photographs). The body of the pump\nand the five camshaft bearings were made of an aluminum alloy. Rubber gaskets\nwere used to seal the delivery valve fittings. All other parts were of steel.\nThe pump body was cast using the permanent mold with sand core process. Steel\nparts were machined all over and wearing surfaces appeared 25X1 B to be well\nground. Tolerances were at the highs limit of U. S. standards, but were\nconsidered satisfactory. 25X1 B Approved For Release 2000/64? 87- CIA-\nRDP81-O4VtWM(M4 W O01-4 FUEL SYSTEM Approved For Release 2000/04/18 : CIA-\nRDP81-01044R$6byd '66tJ 14k L Removal of intake manifolds and fuel injection\nlines would be neces- sary for servicing of the pump. The pump is fastened to\nthe three cast iron brackets by six long thin bolts. The cast iron brackets\nwere bolted to the upper crankcase. The long bolts were probably used to\npermit rocking of the pump to align it more perfectly with the air starter\nshaft and thus to minimize load on the phenolic laminate driving disc. More\ndetails on performance and dimensions are available in a sepa- rate report in\nthe appendix. Photographs of the pump parts may also be found in the appendix.\nA$?

They replaced the old hat-type cleaner\nwhich was formerly mounted on top of the engine. The air cleaners were made in\nthree parts. The bottom section was merely.a large empty can and was intended\nto collect dirt removed by the upper sections. There was very little dirt in\nthis part when re- ceived. The middle section consisted of a cylindrical sheet\nmetal container with seven centrifugal dirt separator cones welded inside. The\npurpose of the cones was to make the incoming air assume a helical path and,\nby centrifugal force, separate the dirt from the air. (Experience with this\ntype of dirt separator on automobiles has shown it to be almost worthless.)\nThe upper cleaner section consisted of oil wetted wire mats. The three\nsections were fastened together with bolts. The two cleaners were indi-\nvidually connected to the two intake manifolds, with no interconnection\nbetween them. The air cleaner body was made of sheet metal which had been\ndrawn to shape and welded. It was well made. To service the air cleaners, at\nleast one transverse louver would have to be removed from the top of the hull.\nThis required removal of four bolts from one of the end plates which provided\nsockets for the louver trunnions. Because of the poor accessibility of the air\ncleaners, it is unlikely that they were serviced very often. The cleaners were\nof such low efficiency and low dirt capacity that, in dusty operation, they\nshould have been cleaned at least once each day and preferably several times\nif any appreciable engine protection were to be obtained.

The Aberdeen report mentioned six fuel tanks of\n120 gallons total capacity. The Aberdeen report photographs show tanks similar\nto those in the G812 tank, except that they appear to be made using less\npreforming of the steel before welding. All tanks appear to be well and\ncarefully made. All fuel and oil tank filler openings were equipped with a 40\nmesh brass cloth cylindrical strainer. All fuel tanks had drain plugs with\ncorresponding plugs in the hull bottom for complete draining of the fuel. The\noil tanks had valves for draining. The tanks, both fuel and oil, are filled by\nremoving small armor plates bolted over the filler opening caps. The oil tank\nfiller open- ing caps were also pressure relief caps. Their purpose could be\nto pre- vent escape of oil when the tank was tipped sidewise or of oil foam\nwhen the tank is moving over rough ground.

No servo mechanism is used. Outward radial movement of\nthe balls in respect to centrifugal force causes axial force on the cone faced\nplate and the opposing flat plate. The flat plate, being free to slide (except\nfor spring resistance) moves the operating arm which in turn works on the\ninjection pump control rack. The engine speed is controlled by manually\nchanging the tension of the springs which resist axial movement of the flat\nplate. All interior parts were smoothly machined and in good condition. Wear\non the pressure plates had occurred to a slight degree. A ball thrust bearing\nis used to transmit axial thrust and a needle bearing is used on the control\narm. The governor case and cover plate were permanent mol aluminum alloy\ncastings. 25X1 B 25X1 B pprove or%lease 2000/04/18 : CIA-RDP81-01044R0001\n00070001-4 Approved For Release 2000/04/18 : CIA-RDP81-01044R000100070001-4\n0308 - GOVERNOR ASSEMBLY - ENGINE A 0 1.

The fuel was thus\nrequired to travel radially through one-half to one inch of felt before\nreaching the perforated core. This type of filter appears vulnerable to early\nplugging. Five mesh screens were provided on the fuel tank openings to prevent\nlarge pieces of dirt from entering the fuel system. An air bleed connection\nwas provided on the output side of the filter to remove entrapped air. A line\nleading to a valve near the driver's seat was fastened to this connection.\nThis filter is apparently similar to that used on the Aberdeen and German\ntanks. The German report describes it as being a copy of the Bosch filter. The\nfilter is readily accessible for servicing.

The report said that if the tank were operated\nin an ambient .temperature of 700 or over, the cooling would not be\nsatisfactory because of boiling of the water. The G812 tank demonstrated some\npossible causes of the poor cooling in the Aberdeen tank. Tube and fin\nconstruction of the radiators was very poor, particularly the soldering of the\nfins to the tubes. It was estimated that over 90% of the fins were non-\nfunctional, either for heat dissipation or core support because of the poor\ncontact area of fins to tubes. There was no oil radiator in the Aberdeen tank,\nas there was in the G812. The addition of the oil radiator would help solve\nthe cooling problem and may represent a change in design for that purpose.\nThere was no way to tell if a change in the size of the fan had been made\nsince the Aberdeen report, but the fan in the G812 tank may be bigger than\nthat described in the German report (dimensions in the German report are too\nvague to be sure of a change). 25X1 B Each water radiator was made of four\nparts, two of them bein of two-tube thickness and the other two of three-tube\nthickness. Water radiators were very close to the exhaust manifold. Areas\nclose to the exhaust manifolds were not different in appearance however; the\npoorly soldered tube-to-fin connections were the rule, rather than confined to\nthis area. Area of the water radiator was approximately 1600 square inches.\nCapacity of each radiator was 7-1/2 gallons.. furnishes more details on\nradiator construction. The following report, SECTION OF RADIATOR CORE REMOVED\nFROM RUSSIAN TANK The construction of this fin and tube type core.was very\npoor, indi- cating that the radiator was either made from very poor tools, or\nwas made without extensive use of tools.. The selection of materials for the\ncore was inconsistant in that one section had brass fins and the other copper.\nIn general, it appeared that the radiator was made from available equipment\nand material, rather than designed for the specific application. There was no\napparent attempt to conserve on the amount of solder used, however, this may\nhave been necessitated to some extent by the poor tool- ing setup. Approved\nFor Release 2000/04/18-: -RDP81-01044% 4 PQOIWA L COOLING SYSTEM Approved For\nRelease 2000/04/18 : CIA-RDP81-01044PRAfiAMNA The core depth was approximately\n3-15/16\", consisting of two ad- jacent parallel cores; one section having a\n2-3/8\" copper fin, three tubes deep; and the other a 1-9/16\" brass fin, two\ntubes deep; all fins had poorly formed rolled edges. The fin spacing was\napproximately 6-3/8 fins. Per,. inch. Several reasons can be advanced for the\ndivided construction of the core; such as, 1. Lack of the of sufficient depth.\n2. Addition of a second section to gain necessary cooling. 3. An attempt to\nprevent curvature or disfiguration of core when installing The distance from\nthe last tube in each row to the ends of the fin varied from 1/2\" to 2\". The\nangle of cutoff varied, which indicates that the fin die was not equipped with\nan automatic cutoff and that the strips of fin material were snipped apart by\nhand. It also suggests that the core may have been assembled by applying the\nfins to the tubes individually, rainer man mserting the tubes into the fins.\nTubes were made of flattened seamless tubing with a wall thickness of .0111',\nincluding solder coating. Tubes were located on 1/2\" centerlines and 60 angle\nto core face. Cross-sectioned tubes measured approximately .665 x .145 \". The\nopenings in the fins exceeded the .14511 dimension by several thousandths\nthroughout the core section. This condition resulted in only an occasional\npoint of contact between the fins and tubes. As the result, over 90% of the\nentire fin area was non-functional, either for heat conduction and\ndissipation, or necessary core strength. The flanged openings were crudely\nformed as far as any intended fit to the tube contour. The dies used in\nforming the fins can be presumed to be very crude, particu-` larly in regard\nto shape of punches. The last tubes in each row were plugged with solder at\nthe header. This condition can prevent failure of the tubes due to stress,\nthese points being the most susceptible. However, it does not remedy tube to\nheader; solder joint failures. A tube to header solder joint failure was.\nnoted at the leading edge of one plugged tube at the end of the outside row.\nThe .032\" header thickness is very light for an assembly using bolted on\ntanks= Shown below is an analysis of the Russian Tank radiator as com 25X1 A\npared with the standard material used for - fin and tube radiators.

The analysis of\nthe individual parts is shown in Table VII. The gears and reverse idler shafts\nwere carburized and hardened. The transmission mainshaft and countershaft were\nquenched and drawn, only. The carbon content of these two shafts remained the\nsame and the nickel and molybdenum was increased over the carburized parts to\nprovide increased hardenability to through-harden the 3-1/8\" section. All of\nthe carburized parts have a hypereutectoid case with excess carbides to a\ndepth of 0.017\" to 0.033 \". There are massive carbides at the surface with a\ncontinuous network be- neath, fading into discontinuous carbides. This\ncondition is conducive to brittleness and spalling on the ends of clash gears\nas was shown in this transmission. It is likely all of the transmission gears\nwere reheated for hardening after carburizing. The gears with internal splines\nin the hub appear to have been quenched on a plug fixture as the splines are\nnot file hard. The web of each gear is file hard. In measuring case depth of\nthe gears difficulty was experienced because of the similarity of case and\ncore structures under the microscope due to the high hardenability-of the\nKrupp steel. To check -the depth of case as measured on the cross section of a\nhardened tooth, a Vickers hardness traverse of the case was made and the\nlocation of the Rockwell \"C\" 45-50 hardness position noted. As a further\ncheck, a gear tooth was annealed and the depth of penetration to the 0.4?Ja\ncarbon point estimated. The residue, scraped from the bottom of the\ntransmission case, after draining the lubricant consists of iron (96?Jo) oil\nand carbon. There is no aluminum and no silicon. This material came from the\nflakes and ground up chips from the gear teeth mixed with oil, and was not\nformed from particles from the trans- mission case or dirt from the outside.\nTransmission Mainshaft The mainshaft was machined from a bar and after heat\ntreatment was shot blasted and then the splines were finish ground.

A large and small bearing\nof each kind were selected as representative of those of Russian make used in\nthe vehicle. The bearing races, balls and rollers were made of high carbon,\nchromium steel with varying small fractional percentages of nickel of the\napproximate composition FS E 52100 or FS E 51100 and hardened through. Both of\nthe large bearings were made of the higher chromium FS E52100 and the smaller\nbearings were. made of FS E51100 except for the inner race of the small ball\nbearing. The composition and properties of the bearings are shown in Table X.\nThe micro-structure of the .races. and rollers or balls is similar for all of\nthe bearings and consists of small spheroidal carbides in a martensite matrix.\nThey may possibly have been a low temper.

However, this\ncondition did not seriously reflect on the serviceability of the parts. 4 -The\nnon-ferrous materia s in the T34 tank were comparable to non-ferrous alloys\ncommonly employed in United States and Western Europe. Parts Examined: Parts\nanalysis contained in this report was confined to the non-ferrous companents\nused in the engine and accessories of the T34 tank, Essentially three basic\nalloys constituted the non-ferrous- materials in the tank. They are. as\nfollows; Section A -Aluminum Alloys Section B -Zinc Alloys Section C -Copper\nAlloys Attention. is also called to the use of tungsten in an electrical\ncontact. - 297 - ENT1,p~i,~ Approved For Release 2000/04/18 :CIA-\nRDP81-01044R0~~100070001-4 NON-FERROUS METALLURGY O N F I D E ii~~r11AA~~..\nApproved For Release 2000/04/18 :CIA-RDP81-0 044R000100070ov1-4 SECTION A\n-ALUMINUM ALLOYS The T34 tank made extensive use of aluminum in the engine and\naccessory parts. Approximately one thousand pounds of aluminum alloys were\nfound in the form of castings, forgings, and wrought bar and sheet stock. See\nTable I for a detailed list of -the form, chemical composition, and weight of\neach of the parts. As the bulk of aluminum used was in cast form, the\nfollowing captioned paragraphs contain general discussion on the various\naspects associated with foundry practice and procedure as reflected in T34\ntank castings. Metal Quality: Particular attention was devoted, to the quality\nof metal used. in the castings. Both X-ray and macro examination indicated\nsound metal structure of good uniform grain size in the cast components. This\ncondition suggested the possibility that some type of modifying agent or grain\nrefinement :had been employed. However, chemical analysis failed to support\nthis contention conclusively. Finishing: This section refers to the amount of\ncleanup and the manner in which it was done in addition to the general\nappearance of the exterior parts. In this respect, the permanent mold castings\nwere found to be in fair to poor condition. Heavy parting lines due to\nimproper closing of the molds were noted. This caused excessive formation of\nflash which could only be removed by considerable cleanup, an operation both\ntime consuming and costly. Also, the crude manner in which the cleanup was\ndone as noted by the tool marks on the parts showed a certain degree of\ncarelessness on -the part of the workman or lack of proper cleanup methods.\nExterior surfaces were generally rough, reflecting rough mold surfaces and\nimproper finishing operations. Foreign Inclusions: Core wires and sand\ninclusions were revealed. in :many of the sand castings and semi-permanent\nmold castings. Also, the effects of soft ramming, inferior mixes and rough\nhandling of cores and molds were noted. These factors indicated that the\nquality control of the sand in the foundries was inferior to our accepted\nstandards. -i Chaplets; One instance where chaplets were employed to hold the\nsand cores in position resulted in severe segregation, cracking, and .porosity\nin their adjacent areas. \": l.t 1~ Design: Castings were designed with\nsuitable fillets and proper blending of the thin and heavy sections. Also,\nextensive use was made of cross hatching permanent .mold sides in order to\nmake the metal .lie quiet during the casting process. This is considered good\npractice and is used to promote better surface condition in many castings. ~\n~d~~F81J~~! i~b4~~elease 2000/04/18 :CIA-RDP81-01044R00010007000'~ ,~, C O'N f\nl D E N T I A L NON-FERROUS METALLURGY Approved For Release 2000/04/18 :CIA-\nRDP81-010448000100070001-4 Heat Treatment: Hardness -values indicated that\ngood heat. treating pr-actice was being observed in ,fabrication of the\n.castings.. However, it is believed that many of the accessory castings not.\nrequiring maximum mechanical properties were unnecessarily heat treated thus\nadding .to production costs. To -avoid repetition during the discussion of\neach of the individual :parts, the following general comments are applicable\nto each of the ...groups of non-ferrous aluminum alloys used in the T34 tank.\nGroup I Aluminum-Silicon-Magnesium Alloys The chemical composition of these\nalloys ranges between these limits: Silicon 5 -13%v Iron .7?,~ Magnesium .2\n-.7% Manganese 0-.6% Aluminum Balance. The majority of aluminum components\nboth by weight and number used in this tank engine were cast .from a modified\nsiiumin alloy. This alloy, common to European practice, contained 8-10%\nsilicon and 0.3?Io magnesium. The silicon content is approximately 1?Jo above\nthe maximum limits specified for silicon in the.. Alcoa 356. alloy. and\nslightly more than this for Alcoa 355 alloy, however, it is common practice to\nconsider all, of these alloys in the same category. The cylinder block with\nits many cored passages is a good example of an intricate casting illustrating\nthe excellent castability of the. alloy. This- ma- terial also provides a good\ncombination of .resistance to corrosion and pres- sure tightness: It is used\nin casting applications receiving severe usage. It responds readily to heat\ntreatment, with various combinations of mechanical properties obtainable by\nsolution heat treatment and artificial aging. This alloy was used to good\nadvantage in sand, permanent mold, and semi- permanent mold castings for\nnumerous components in the T34 tank engine as indicated in Table I. Group II\nAluminum -Copper Casting Alloys The ranges for the usual chemical composition\nof these alloys are: Copper 6-8% Iron 0.3 -1.5?,b Silicon 0.3 -4. (~ Zinc\n0-2.5% Aluminum Balance - 299 - Approved For Release 20Q0/04/18 :CIA-\nRDP81-01~~~(~d(~I~~Tl~\"'I -4 Nov-pprove?c~~or~e~e~'ase~000/04/18 :CIA-RDP81-01\n~~I~b~bRddtl~'ddba -4 Alloys in the above .ranges are usually produced from\nsecondary material which, accounts for the presence of manganese, nickel. and\nother common impurities generally found in aluminum. At one time, alloys in\nthis -range constituted a large portion of our production. Some of the better\nknown designations are Alcoa's 112-1.13 or No. 12. It is employed in intricate\ncasting designs where pressure tightness is a requisite. Machinability is\ngood. The .alloy is heat treatable but more often is used without any.\ntreatment because the improvement in mechanical properties -does not warrant\nthe additional cost in many instances. A good application of this alloy was\nshown in the air cleaner to intake manifold elbow casting. Group III Aluminum-\nCopper-Zinc Alloys Chemical composition of these alloys ranges between the\nfollowing limits: Copper- 1-4% Iron Max. 1.5% Manganese 0-1% Nickel 0 -1%\nSilicon Max. 3% Zinc 4 -15% Aluminum Balance Referred to as the German alloy,\nthis alloy -has good castability, high strength, and ductility and was\nsatisfactorily used in the production of the upper and lower transmission\ncases. It functions as an intermediate alloy between aluminum-copper and\naluminum-silicon alloys. With .zinc the alloy age hardens rapidly at room\ntemperature with resultant losses in ductility. Also, these alloys are\nconsidered to be hot short if the iron and silicon content is low and as such\nshould ,not be cast in a permanent mold: A comparable aluminum alloy\nspecified' within this .composition range would be Alcoa 645. Group N\nAluminum-Copper -Silicon Chemical composition ranges between: Copper.. j 2\n-6?,b Silicon ' 3-6% Iron 1?,~ Aluminum ' Balance Alloys within this range\ncompared to the Alcoa 85 alloy used in die casting applications, having\nexcellent castability with a low shrinkage coefficient, C 0,~~~~~\ni~b~-14elease 2000/04/18 :CIA-RDP81-010448000100070001:-4, C O IV F I D E N T\nI A L NON-FERROUS METALLURGY Approved For Release 2000/04/18 :CIA-\nRDP81-010448000100070001-4 particularly suited to parts which must withstand\nhigh pressure in service. Although classed here as die casting alloys, they\ncan be used for permanent mold castings such as in the T34 fuel transfer pump.\nMachinability is generally considered inferior to the aluminum-copper alloys.\nGroup V Aluminum-Copper -Nickel Chemical composition ranges between: Capper\n3-5% Nickel 1-2.5% Magnesium .5-2.0?,b Iron .7?,~ Silicon .7?~0 Aluminum\nBalance Alcoa 142 alloys of the \"Y\" alloy type fall within this wide\nclassification. These alloys have high mechanical properties in the as cast\nand heat treated condition. Alloys in this group are often used for forging\nstock as in the case of engine pistons because of the good hot strength\nproperties imparted by the nickel and the general good forging characteristics\nof this material. Group VI Duralumin Alloys Chemical composition ranges\nbetween: Copper 3-5% Iron Max. .8% Magnesfurn .3-2.0?b Manganese .3-1.5%\nSilicon .2 -1.5?~O Aluminum Balance Group VII Miscellaneous Aluminum Alloys\nOne part to be included in this catE-gory was the water filler and pressure\ncap housing which apparently was composed of a high zinc (25.4%) copper (8.2%)\nalloy. The large amount of impurities present indicated that this alloy was of\na secondary nature melted down from scrap containing high. zinc and copper.\nThe corrosion rate of such an alloy increases as the zinc content increases\nand as such is not considered to be very satisfactory when exposed to a\ncorrosive environment. The remainder of this section is devoted to the\ndetailed examination of each of the aluminum parts, i - 301-- Approved For\nRelease 2000/04/18 :CIA-RDP81-O~~~f~~~~~~I'8`d'01-4 _ ,~ Approved For Release\n2000/04/18 :CIA-RDP81-010448000100070001-4 25X1A Laboratory Serial No. 262056\nDate XC ED NO.

T34 tank were cast as sand, permanent mold, and die\ncastings. In composition these alloys compared to the Zamak 2, 3, and 5 allays\nused in the United States. Whenever zinc alloys are examined for quality\nparticular attention is devoted to the quantity of contaminating elements\nlead, tin, and cadmium present in the alloy. The care taken to control these\nelements to low maximum limits is a good indication of the extent to which\nfoundry control is prac- ticed by the manufacturer. If the contaminating\nelements are not con- trolled heavy intergranular corrosion will occur in the-\nform of heavy prod- ucts between the grains, resulting in a failure of the\npart. In the T34 tank parts these limits were maintained slightly above the\nmaxi- mum recommended in our practice -see Table I. As a result two die cast\nparts, i.e, periscope body and odometer-speedometer assembly showed the\neffects of intergranular attack upon micro examination and inspection of the\nfractured pieces. In the fractured parts intergranular attack appeared as a\nuniform dark band which had progressed inwards to a depth of 0.020 \". Group I\nZinc-Aluminum-Copper Alloys Chemical composition ranges between limits: Copper\n2.5 -3.5% Aluminum 3.5 -4.5% Lead Max. .007?,b Cadmium Max. .005% Tin Max.\n.005?,b Zinc Balance Chemical analysis given in Table I indicates that the\nperiscope body was die cast from an alloy comparable to Zamak 2. It is used\nwhere high strength and hardness are necessary. Our analysis indicated that\nsome control was exercised to avoid excessive amounts of cadmium, tin, and\nlead in the die castings. Group II Zinc-Aluminum Alloys Chemical composition\nranges between limits: Copper Max. .10%0 Aluminum 3.5 -4.5% Magnesium .03-.08%\nIron Max. .10?b Lead Max. .007% Cadmium Max. .005% Tin Max. .005% Zinc Balance\n- 351 - Approved For Release 2000/04/18 :CIA-RDP81-o1 ~b~bR~dRl~ddb~r-4 N\n~c~r~e~~~~00/04/18 :CIA-RDP81-01 (~~~9~~7.~Qi0~~-4 The speedometer-odometer\nbody employed an alloy comparable to Zamak 3. It is a general purpose alloy in\nwhich a greater dimensional stability can be maintained than with the other\nzinc alloys. Also, alloys in this grouping have better physical properties at\nelevated temperatures. Because of these characteristics the castings can be\nstabilized prior to service installations. Group III Zinc-Aluminum Alloy\nChemical composition ranges between limits: Copper 0.75-1.25?,b Aluminum\n3.5-4.30% Magnesium 0.03-0.08% Iron 0.1000% Lead Max. .007?0 Cadmium Max.\n.005% Tin Max. .005% Zinc Balance An alloy from this group was used in\nfabrication of the fuel tank selector valve body. The alloy was comparable to\nZamak 5 which is a general purpose alloy having good dimensional stability and\nimpact strength at room temperature.

These ma- terials are comparable to alloys used in other countries for\nsheet, bar and cast products. All copper-containing components were not\ninvestigated, however, various parts as listed in Table I thought to be of a\nrepresentative nature were studied. The role of non-ferrous alloys in bearing\nfabrication is brought out later in this report. Group I Copper-Zinc Alloys\nChemical composition ranges between limits: Copper 59% to 62% Zinc Balance\nBrasses in the abave range are known as Muntz metal. These alloys have high\nstrength combined with low ductility. Their application in the tank engine was\nlimited to small parts such as washers and valve stems. Also, these alloys\nhave excellent hot working qualities but only a fair degree of cold\nworkability. Their machinability characteristics are good. Group II Copper-\nZinc-Tin Alloy Chemical composition ranges between limits: Copper 94% to 96?,b\nTin 1% to 3% Zinc Balance Alloys in this group are applicable to parts such as\nthe .starter switch contact assembly in which good electrical conductivity and\nspring qualities are required. This alloy has good corrosion properties,\nresistance to dissipation in heat of arcing, and resistance to mechanical\nwear. It is well to note, however, that in this part the aforementioned\nproperties were not depended upon. Instead silver attached to above bronze\nclip was used as a contact point. - 361 - Approved For Release 2000/04/18\n:CIA-RDP81-016~R~d~l ~~~'b~l -4 rvon~4p~t8 I~F~ta2000/04/18 :CIA-\nRDP81-O'~4~R60D'~p0~'~QQQ1-4 Group III Copper-Aluminum-Iron Alloys Chemical\ncomposition ranges between limits: Aluminum 8.5-9.5% Iron 2.5-4.0% Copper\nBalance The outer portion of the turret drive worm wheel was made from an\nalumi- num bronze alloy of this composition. It is ~a non-heat treatable type\nof aluminum bronze suitable far severe service. These alloys have excellent\nwear resistant and anti-friction properties needed for this application, Group\nN Copper-Silicon-Zinc Alloys Chemical composition ranges between limits:\nCopper 80.0 to 83,0% Silicon 3.0 to 4,25% Zinc Balance Although composition of\nthe periscope plate (see Table I) does not fall within the range given above,\nenough similarity exists to class it as a silicon brass. As such it compares\nto the ASTM B-176-50T, alloy C type, This alloy is generally reserved for\npressure die castings, however, in the fabrication of the periscope plate the\nsand casting method was employed. Alloys of this group have good fluidity,\nhigh tensile properties and are well adapted to .intricate shapes. The\nremainder of this section contains a detailed account of the inspection of\neach of the copper parts.

Structure of the\nlining is fairly good. The 39 Rockwell C journal used in this engine should be\nquite satisfactory for operation against these 'bearings. The following\nbushings, all bronze castings, have been analyzed with results as shown: Oil\npump shaft bushing Copper 88.5?0 Tin 8.7% Lead .2?6 Zinc Balance R \"B\" 61\nArticulating rod bearing Spectrographically similar to above. Connecting rod\nupper end bushing Spectrographically similar to above. The only remarkable\nthing about this composition of bronze for these applications is that it\ncontains so little lead. Normal procedure here would be to use S.A.E. 791, or\nif pounding were too heavy for this material, S.A.E. 792. If a casting were\nessential, 5.A.E. 64 or 660 would probably be used. The water pump shaft\nbushing appears, from its spectrographic analysis, tv be a silicon bronze,\ncontaining no manganese or aluminum and minor amounts of zinc. There appears\nto be more lead present here than in most silicon bronzes. Silicon bronze is\nnot commonly used as a bearing. Its main characteristics are Brood resistance\nto corrosion by some aqueous solutions, high strength and hardness (Rockwell B\n69 in this case).

Inforr=nation on\nexpected loads would throw some light on this. It generally requires good\nlubrication, and in this case received it. Camshaft bracket composition\nelsewhere reported is rather a structural than a bearing alloy. The unhardened\ncamshaft journals, Rc26, will probably wear more heavily than we would think\ndesirable, but it would be a long time before this seriously affected the\noperation of the tank, Fuel Transfer .Pump Shaft Bushing This part is a low-\ntin, high-lead bronze with a remarkably high' percentage of nickel.\nComposition found was as follows: Copper 68.3% Tin 4.0% Lead 24.5% Nickel 3.1%\nThis almost classifies as a copper-lead. It is unusual to make so fragile a\npart a,s this of such ahigh-lead material without a steel back. The addi- tion\nof the high nickel content was undoubtedly made to strengthen and harden the\ncopper base matrix. This aim was achieved; hardness was Rockwell F64, which is\nequivalent to a Brinell hardness of 5?-58 on the 500 kilogram scale. The\ncomparative figure without the nickel would be about 50. Lead dispersion was\nexcellent. The piece had a lead colored fracture, indicating good cleanliness\nof the melt. The reason for use of so much lead in the alloy was doubtless the\nfact that the bushing is lubricated only with Diesel fuel oil. Light load\npermits limited hardness. In accordance with the composition, a hardened\njournal was used. If we had a similar problem to solve, we would produce a\nflanged, steel- backed bushing out of a .strip, using much the same bearing\nalloy without the nickel.

The\nfollowing evaluation of oils and greases was made: - Transmission Oil and\nEngine Oil The analysis of the transmission oil as obtained by the Fuels and\nLubricants Laboratory was compared with the Aberdeen Automotive Laboratory\nresults on a Russian tank transmission oil in 1942. As can be seen from Table\nI, there has .been very little change. The oil is essentially on SAE 50 engine\noil with no additives. (A small amount of fatty oil appears to be present in\nthe transmission oil analysis. Since not enough is indicated to make any\nsubstantial difference, the fatty oil may be an impurity. 2 - In Table I there\nis also a comparison of the 1942 Aberdeen results on the engine oil Except\nthat the pour point is substantially lower than that of the above mentioned\ntransmission oil, the present engine oil resembles both the transmission oil\nand the 1942 engine oil. 3 -Diesel Fuel Oil Table II shows the comparison of\ndata on fuel oils as reported by Aberdeen in 1942 The data show that the oils\nare in every way similar and that a reasonably good grade of -fuel was being\nused in both cases. 4 -Final Drive Housing Oil 25X1 A Table .III shows\nanalysis of the final drive housing oil. This appears to be an SAE 80 gear oil\nwith some sodium base grease mixed in, probably as an impurity. The oil itself\nhas no extreme pressure or other additives. 5 -Texas Company Analysis of\nRussian Oils Table IV shows part of the Texas Company analytical data on\nvarious Russian oils as reported in 1943. This table is included because it\nindicates that the tendency , at that time was to use straight mineral oils of\nthe same general viscosity ranges as were found in the present T34 tank. It\nseems of more than passing interest to the writer that no advantage appears to\nhave been taken of the considerable strides that have been made in the fields\nof detergent and other type additives. 25X1A 25X1A - 381 - Approved For\nRelease 2000/04/18 :CIA-RDP81-01~9~~1~dl~l~~TT~d1-4 Approved For Release\n2000/04/18 :CIA-RDP81-010448000100070001-4 FUEL AND LUBRICANT C O N F I D E N\nT I A L 6 - In Table V a partial report of the Texas Company data of 1943 on\nvarious Russian greases is included. The reason no comparisons have been made\ndirectly between these greases and the greases found in the Russian tank,\nwhich is being investigated, is that the two groups of greases bear no general\nrelation to each other. Of the three greases reported by the Texas Company,\nonly one is calcium soap base, whereas all of the ones found in T34 tank have\na calcium soap base. Whereas melting point appeared to be of some interest in\nthe early greases, it appears that the present Russian thinking does not place\nmuch value on this property. 7 -Data on Calcium Soap Base Greases with a\nMineral Oil Base Table VI shows the two greases that most closely resemble\nthose in Table V. The wheel hub lubricant consists of an SAE lOW oil thickened\nwith 11% calcium soap. This is a type of grease quite often encountered in\nAmerican practice. The coil spring suspension case has an extremely hard\nsmooth .orange colored grease made #rom SAE 10W oil thickened with 27% calcium\nsoap. Except for the presence of a substantial amount of asphaltic material of\nunknown source, this grease is not unusual. The source of the asphalt could\nnot be deter- mined because of the large amount of debris such as dirt,\n.rocks, canvas, etc, present in the original sample. $ -Analysis of Grease\nContaining Wool Fat Table VII shows the analysis of three greases, all of\nwhich contain a substantial amount of wool fat. The turret bearing grease\n.contained 20.7% wool fat in addition to 3.7% calcium soap in which there was\na trace of sodium soap, This material also contained 75ab of either a very\nsoft petrolatum ar a mixture of petrolatum and oil. -The end result was grease\nwith a dropping point of 136?F. This grease should be very useful where water\nresistance is needed, but would seem of doubtful value if high temperature\nadhesion were required. Although the sample of water pump grease received was\ninsufficient to make a detailed analysis, it appeared to be similar to that\nfound in the turret bearing. The grease in the suspension shaft inside the\nhull was a combination of three materials. These were a grease similar to that\nfound in the water pump, a grease similar to that found in the wheel hub, and\na heavy mineral oil which did not appear to have separated from the greases.\nThe three were not well mixed and it appears that this unit -was lubricated\nwith whatever happened to be handy at the moment. In general, two conclusions\ncan be reached from the analyses of the lubri- cants in the subject T34 tank:\nApproved For Release 2000/04/18 :CIA-RDP81-010448000100070001-4 CONFIDENTIAL -\n382 - CONFIDENTIAL FuE~ AN t Approved For Release 2000/04/18 :CIA-\nRDP81-01044R0S0~~~~~~1-4 1 -The Russians have not taken advantage of recent\nresearch in oil additives. 2 -Water .insolubility o~ the grease used in the\nT34 tank seems to be of prime consideration, with less temperature resistance\nbeing required. - 383 - Approved For Release 2000/04/18 :CIA-\nRDP81-0~~2~6~'~d~~bb1-4 r uc` tlrvu L,U IV 1 Approve or elease 2000/04/18\n:CIA-RDP81-O'Fd~~'1~6b~'~AOa0~1-4 COMPARISON OF ABERDEEN AUTOMOTNE LABORATORY\nRESULTS 25X1 A REPORTED IN 1942 WITH DATA ON 1951 TANK OILS, Pour Point\nNaphtha Insol.

Electrical connection insulators, for instance,\nhad a tensile strength of approximately 1800 psi and an ultimate elongation of\n650%. The following parts tested were found to be of natural rubber: 1\n-Electrical connection insulators 2 -Outer cover layer on oil and water line\nconnector hoses 3 -Cylinder sleeve water seal 4 -Bogie wheel tires Neoprene\nType Synthetic Rubber: All rubber parts on the tank which would ordinarily be\nsubjected to contact with oil or fuel were made of a polychoroprene (neoprene)\nsynthetic rubber. This particular polychoroprene is apparently the Russian\nsynthetic Sovaprene, which is similar to our neoprene rubbers. Samples of\nneoprene rubber were found to have comparatively poor tensile and elongation\nproperties and good oil and heat resistance properties. The. average tensile\nstrength of the neoprene inner layer of oil and water line connector hoses was\n400 to 800 psi with 50 to 200% elongation. This indicates that the stock is\nhighly loaded with carbon blacks and other types of fillers. (This could be a\nmeans of conserving their rubber supply.) Oil resistance tests of the. same\nsample showed 40 to 80% volume swell after 70 hours at 212oF in ASTM #3 oil.\nThis is considered good for polychoroprene type compounds. Adhesive properties\non all hose parts were very poor. (This factor may indicate a shortage of\nnatural rubber for adhesive compounds or may represent what the Russians\nconsider a satisfactory product.) Heat resistance tests conducted at 212?F for\n70 hours show no appreciable loss in tensile strength, indicating good heat\nresistance. The following Cold Room tests on a neoprene sample (peep window\nhead pad) were reported: 5 hours at - 40?F flex OK 5 hours at - 65?F flex OK\n70 hours at - 40?F flex OK 70 hours at - 65?F sample brake Parts made of\nneoprene are listed below: 1 -Connector hose from intake manifolding elbow to\nair cleaner duct and intake manifold 2 -Final drive dust seal - 391 - Approved\nFor Release 2000/04/18 :CIA-RDP81-d1 ~4~F~~~1 101-4 ~~e~lA~~~ Release\n2000/04/18 :CIA-RDP81-0104C41~00~1IOD0070001-4 N ENTIAL 3 -Grommet in\nconnection from fuel line to injection nozzle 4 -Grommet in oil return line\nfrom head to crankcase 5 -Head-block water port gaskets 6 -Antenna anti-\nvibration gaskets 7 -Cylinder sleeve oil seal 8 -Inner layer of oil and water\nline connector hoses 9 -Peep window head pads Buna S Synthetic Rubbers:\nSamples of Buna S type rubber were found to have low tensile strength and\nfairly good elongation properties. This type of rubber was used for vibration\nand electrical insulation. A sample of 24 volt high current ca- pacity wire\ninsulation tested had a tensile strength of 490 psi, elongation of 525%, and a\nDurometer hardness of 60. Another sample, from a smaller wire, had a tensile\nstrength too low to test, elongation of 450%, and Duro- meter hardness of 60.\nAnother Buna S sample, from the driver's periscope vibration insulator, had a\ntensile strength of 600 psi and appeared to be from a stock highly loaded with\nfillers. Tests on the suspension arm bumpex indicated that an exceptionally\nvolatile plasticizer was used in the compound. The bumper examined showed\nindications of having been subjected to extreme heat, either from direct\ncontact with #ire or from high and frequent impact. Cold Room tests on a Buna\nS sample (generator drive coupling) revealed the following: 5 hours at - 40?F\nflex OK 5 hours at - 65?F flex OK The following parts tested were of Buna S: 1\n-Driver's periscope vibration insulator 2 -Instrument panel vibration\ninsulators 3 -Suspension arm bumpers 4 -Generator drive coupling 5 -Periscope\nhandle grip 6 -Ammunition cushions 7 -Oil, fuel, and air line vibration\ninsulators 8 -Insulation on electrical wiring The following report represents\nfurther analysis on miscellaneous rubber parts (non-oil resistant\napplications) removed from the tank. 1 -PHYSICAL PROPERTIES The physical-\nproperties of the parts as tested appear to be approxi- mately 30?,~ lower\nthan those generally specified for current automotive rubber parts and the\nspecification limits for U. S, tank rubber parts built for World War II, and\n50?,~ lower than those being established for the current tank building\nprogram.

The higher standards affecting our\ncurrent tank rubber parts are based on an Ordnance request that oil resistance\nand flexibility at -65?F be specified on a large majority of the rubber parts\nrequired for both current and future tank building programs. All parts tested\nhardened far beyond our specification limits at both -35 and -65?F. The\nmajority of parts showed excessive bloom. All parts ignited and burned more\nfreely than U. S, \"general use \" type polymer base compounds, 2 -FABRICATION\nTECHNIQUE (a) Extruded Parts Indications from the parts examined in regard to\n\"rating the fabri- cation technique \" are that the parts were: 1 -run by\ninexperienced processing or machine hands, 2 -made from poor extrusion stocks,\n3 -extruded at extremely high speeds intentionally, The above is based on the\nextreme surface roughness, both inside and outside, of the parts submitted.\n(b) Molded Parts All molded parts indicated good molding equipment and\ntechnique with the exception that little time was spent for trimming the\nparts. This applies to both functional and non-functional items. 3 -SOURCE AND\nPART IDENTIFICATION No source of manufacturer or part identification, such as\npart number, was apparent on any of the parts examined. 4 -GENERAL SERVICE\nCONDITIONS With the exception of the suspension bumper (item #3) none of of\nthe parts covered by this analysis was subjected to severe service conditions.\nApproved For Release 2000/04/18 :CIA-RDP8~?1W~411QIOi9~0001-4 ~6~ea?

The filler plies are cotton duck and the piece seems to be\nof good quality. This type of laminate has been available commercially in\nEurope and the United States the past thirty years. The workmanship on the\npart is poor, but sufficient. The only tools used on this part are handsaw,\ndrill press, file, and sand paper. ANTENNA INSULATOR This part is made from a\nmacerated paper phenolic molding material. The part is compression molded and\nno attempt has been made to remove the mold flash. The material and part\nappear to be adequate for the application. This type of material has also been\navailable commercially for the past thirty years. COMPRESSED AIR TANK VALVE\nKNOB This part is compression molded from a urea formaldehyde cellulose filled\nmolding material. The material is of poor grade. It appears to be im- properly\nmixed or .contaminated with a white material of the same type. The mold flash\nhas been very crudely removed. The valve stem insert is cut from brass hexagon\nbar stock and is of poor design according to our standards. However, the part\nappears to be sub- stantial enough to do the work required of it. TURRET\nELECTRICAL SUPPLY SLIP RING The material used in this part is a rag filled\nphenolic compression molding stock. It is molded in two parts and the mold\nflash very crudely removed by hand. The part is of rugged design. The slip\nring connectors are made of brass and are silver plated. The molded inserts in\nthis part are knurled and consistent with our design standard and practices.\nHowever, no more are used than necessary. Some connectors are riveted in with\ncopper rivets. This possibly explains the use of such a high impact molding\nstock. BATTERY CELL CASE The construction of this cell case is of very poor\ndesign and indicates that there was not enough mold equipment available to\nfollow better practice. - 39? - CONFIDENTIAL Approved For Release 2000/04/18\n:CIA-RDP81-010448000100070001-4 P~ppr~ve~?o~r'~e 2000/04/18 :CIA-\nRDP81-010~~QQq'tp@a17'~p~~: 4 The cell case is made by wrapping a hot asphalt\nimpregnated loose cellulose paper around a mold. After this part was hardened,\nit is removed and sealed into a wooden case with more asphalt. The cover and\nplate assembly is consistent with our practice. It is felt that this type of\nconstruction might not have too good a field life because of possible case\ndistortion. PILOT'S HEAD BUMPER Consists of a sack made of flat cotton duck\nand a cotton sateen containing a coarse wool and hair felt pad. This assembly\nis fastened to a metal plate. The fabric has a coarse texture and apparently\nvery little sizing. There is nothing new or exceptional about this material.
