Before\nyou go jumping to conclusions about her ineptitude, Brianna Janel was actually\nfollowing the rules laid out by Tesla.\n\n#### Related Content\n\nWant to Steal a Tesla?

Should the vehicle have no power, these\nmodels do have auxiliary manual cable release levers also found on the door\npanel, but Tesla warns against using the manual mechanism, citing that it\nshould only be used when the car has no power. Janel said she was aware of\nthis option but didn\u2019t want to risk damaging her car, and she felt confident\nthat she could stick out the heat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn contrast to Tesla\u2019s potentially dangerous warnings, Lucid Motors requires\nall occupants to exit the vehicle before the installation process begins, and\nthe Lucid Air owners manual states that owners will not be able to lock or\nunlock the doors during an update. The Air will start a two-minute countdown\nwhen an owner chooses to install an update, giving them enough time to get out\nprior to the update beginning.\n\nThe Tesla owners manual states that the car will not initiate a software\nupdate if Keep Climate mode, Dog Mode, Sentry Mode or Camp Mode are engaged,\nbut it fails to require vehicle occupants to exit the vehicle before the\ndebilitating installation process begins. Tesla also recommends owners install\nsoftware updates as soon as possible, which could cause some owners to feel\nobligated to initiate an update in a compromised environment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanel said her car estimated the install would only take 24 minutes, but it\nactually took 40 minutes, which was long enough for her car\u2019s interior to\nreach 115 degrees. In a follow-up video, her caption states that she was\nafraid to mess up her car by getting out during the installation. She claims\nto have owned a Tesla for six years, and she said she will continue to own her\ncar for many years, despite this experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTesla needs to either require that all occupants exit the vehicle before\nbeginning a software install, or at least alter its verbiage to prevent\nincidents like this from occurring, especially as we approach a summer with\nhigher global temperatures than ever before. If someone living in a town like\nPhoenix, Arizona or Las Vegas, Nevada were to face the same situation, it\ncould pose a more serious health risk. If there are any Tesla owners reading,\nplease make sure you are not parked in direct sunlight when you initiate a\nsoftware update if you are going to remain in the car.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
