Overall, we find that\n> participants who had access to an AI assistant based on OpenAI's codex-\n> davinci-002 model wrote significantly less secure code than those without\n> access. Additionally, participants with access to an AI assistant were more\n> likely to believe they wrote secure code than those without access to the AI\n> assistant. Furthermore, we find that participants who trusted the AI less\n> and engaged more with the language and format of their prompts (e.g. re-\n> phrasing, adjusting temperature) provided code with fewer security\n> vulnerabilities. Finally, in order to better inform the design of future AI-\n> based Code assistants, we provide an in-depth analysis of participants'\n> language and interaction behavior, as well as release our user interface as\n> an instrument to conduct similar studies in the future.\n\nComments:| 16 pages, 16 figures, update adds names of statistical tests and\nsurvey questions, full version of conference paper  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2211.03622 [cs.CR]  \n(or arXiv:2211.03622v3 [cs.CR] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2211.03622arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \nJournal reference:| CCS '23: Proceedings of the 2023 ACM SIGSAC Conference on\nComputer and Communications Security, November 2023, Pages 2785-2799  \nRelated DOI:| https://doi.org/10.1145/3576915.3623157DOI(s) linking to related\nresources  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Neil Perry [view email] [v1] Mon, 7 Nov 2022 15:19:20 UTC (3,940 KB)\n[v2] Fri, 16 Dec 2022 19:01:32 UTC (4,624 KB) [v3] Mon, 18 Dec 2023 17:26:48\nUTC (5,550 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Do Users Write More Insecure Code with AI\nAssistants?, by Neil Perry and 3 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CR\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2211\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\n### 1 blog link\n\n(what is this?)\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
