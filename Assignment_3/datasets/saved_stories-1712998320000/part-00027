Credit:\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison\n\nScientists at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison have developed a cost-\neffective and environmentally sustainable way to make a popular pain reliever\nand other valuable products from plants instead of petroleum.\n\nBuilding on a previously patented method for producing paracetamol\u2014the active\ningredient in Tylenol\u2014the discovery promises a greener path to one of the\nworld's most widely used medicines and other chemicals. More importantly, it\ncould provide new revenue streams to make cellulosic biofuels\u2014derived from\nnon-food plant fibers\u2014cost competitive with fossil fuels, the primary driver\nof climate change.\n\n\"We did the R&D to scale it and make it realizable,\" says Steven Karlen, a\nstaff scientist at the Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center who led the\nresearch published recently in the journal ChemSusChem.\n\nParacetamol, also known as acetaminophen, is one of the most widely used\npharmaceuticals, with a global market value of about $130 million a year.\nSince it was introduced in the early 1900s, the drug has traditionally been\nmade from derivatives of coal tar or petroleum.\n\nIn 2019, Karlen and UW\u2013Madison biochemistry professor John Ralph showed how it\ncould be made instead from a compound in poplar trees using a well-known\nchemical reaction.\n\nNow Karlen's team has improved the process for making paracetamol as well as\nother drugs, pigments, textiles, and biodegradable plastics with a cumulative\nmarket value of more than $1.5 billion, a portfolio of products that Karlen\nsays could support dozens of small biorefineries feeding into larger hubs\nwithout saturating the market.\n\nThe process is available for commercial licensing through the Wisconsin Alumni\nResearch Foundation, the nonprofit organization that commercializes university\ndiscoveries to support ongoing research.\n\nThe paracetamol molecule is made of a six-carbon benzene ring with two\nchemical groups attached. Poplar trees produce a similar compound called\np-hydroxybenzoate (pHB) in lignin, the part of the cell wall that binds plant\nsugars together and provides structure.\n\nLignin is chock full of valuable aromatic compounds that could replace many\npetrochemicals and provide biorefineries with additional revenue streams to\nmake plant-based fuels cost-competitive. The challenge is breaking down the\ncomplex and irregular chain of molecules into useful components.\n\nIt turns out that pHB is relatively easy to break off with chemical treatment,\nbut while the initial discovery showed it was chemically possible to turn it\ninto paracetamol, Karlen says that the process didn't convert enough of the\nraw material into the final product.\n\nResearch scientist Vitaliy Tymokhin discovered that treating poplar biomass\nwith a different\u2014and typically cheaper\u2014method converted nearly all the pHB\ninto another chemical that can then be converted into paracetamol or a less\nvaluable molecule with other applications.\n\n\"You can make dyes like black ink, polymers which can be used in textiles or\nmaterial application, convert it to adhesives or into stuff like that,\" Karlen\nsays. \"It's got a huge market and big value.\"\n\nBy recycling the unreacted product back through in a continuous reactor, the\nscientists successfully converted 90% of the raw material into paracetamol,\nwhich they extracted using a method that's cheaper than traditional\npurification techniques. Karlen says it should be possible to dial the yield\nup to 99%.\n\nThe process is primarily water-based, relies on green solvents, and is\ncontinuous rather than a batch reaction, which makes it ideal for industrial\napplications.\n\n\"As I'm chopping the tree up, it can feed right into a reactor that pulls out\nthe benzamide,\" Karlen says. \"So you're never stopping. As fast as your trucks\ncan come in and fill that hopper, you can keep processing.\"\n\nMore information: Steven D Karlen et al, Production of biomass\u2010derived\np\u2010hydroxybenzamide: Synthesis of p\u2010aminophenol and paracetamol, ChemSusChem\n(2024).
