Wade, abortions are increasing in the U.S.\n\nRyan Adamczeski\n\nMarch 25 2024 3:06 PM EST\n\nMarch 25 2024 3:06 PM EST\n\nDespite abortion restrictions being implemented in 21 states since the\noverturning of Roe v. Wade, a new report from the Guttmacher Institute found\nthat \"abortions in the U.S. are increasing.\" An estimated 1,026,690 abortions\nwere performed in the country in 2023, marking a 10 percent increase since\n2020 \u2014 the highest rate in over a decade.\n\nOver 160,000 patients traveled out of state in 2023 to seek abortion care, and\n\"states bordering ban states had particularly large increases.\" The report\nnoted that \"while access has decreased dramatically in states with bans,\nalmost all other states have experienced substantial increases in the number\nof abortions provided.\"\n\nShutterstock\n\n\"In part, this is because the drastic loss of access in states with bans has\nbeen counterbalanced by monumental efforts on the part of clinics, abortion\nfunds, and logistical support organizations to help people in ban states\naccess care through financial and practical support,\" it stated.\n\nThe increase is due to a number of factors, including broader access via\ntelehealth platforms, and policies in 22 states as well as the District of\nColumbia protecting the care. The trend \"can be positive,\" the report stated,\nbut overall simply \"reflects larger shifts in people\u2019s childbearing desires\nover time.\"\n\nShutterstock\n\nThe report stressed that \"increases do not negate the impact of anti-abortion\npolicies,\" but rather \"the data provides important evidence that people will\ncontinue to seek abortion care in spite of the policy barriers that anti-\nabortion policymakers impose.\" In particular, \"communities of color, LGBTQ+\npeople, young people, immigrants, people living with low incomes and those\nliving with disabilities already contend with multiple barriers to accessing\ncare.\"\n\nIt also emphasized that the estimated numbers \"are almost certainly an\nundercount,\" as they include only the abortions obtained \"within the formal US\nhealth care system,\" such as clinics or doctor\u2019s offices, and via telehealth\nand virtual providers.\n\n\"State policymakers must develop and pass robust laws that support people\u2019s\nability to access abortion care with dignity and respect \u2014 for their own\nresidents and for patients from other states,\" the report concluded.\n\nFrom Your Site Articles\n\n  * How important is abortion in the 2024 elections?
