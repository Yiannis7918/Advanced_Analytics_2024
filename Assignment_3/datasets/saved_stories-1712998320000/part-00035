Yet what if it was all much easier and much harder to\nunderstand? What if the necessary knowledge was finite and more rapidly\nattainable to a broader population than those select few? What if there was a\nway to identify and abstract the most basic physical structures, a list of all\nthe tools to build and operate on those structures, and a user's guide to\ndescribe how to use those tools?\n\nThe Graph, Wall, Tome project demonstrates that these resources exist and\nalready cover much of the necessary ground, but also that they are still\nflawed and need refinement. Edward Witten, perhaps the most intelligent living\nphysicist, wrote a paragraph in 1987 (from his address at the International\nCongress of Mathematicians, Berkeley, August 1986) that linguistically encodes\nand abstracts the most basic structures underlying physics, such that their\nfunction can still be understood even if the particular underlying equation\nmay change. This is the Graph. Jim Simons, billionaire physicist, commissioned\nthe iconic Wall at State University of New York Stony Brook which has\ninscribed upon it the equations of what Witten says in addition to some of\nhistory's most important mathematical and physical results. This is the Wall.\nSir Roger Penrose, Nobel laureate and intellectual descendant of Albert\nEinstein\u2019s school of geometric physics, wrote a book titled The Road to\nReality, which describes and summarizes how to use the mathematics and physics\ncontained within the Wall and the Graph. This is the Tome.\n\nAlready in these objects together is enough information to begin a serious\nstudy of physics at its most fundamental level and comprehend the deep\nconnections between mathematics and physics. Yet, almost no one knows or seeks\nthem. Further still, as recently as the 1950s we were confused about the\nstructure of the universe: we didn't know the world is left-right asymmetric,\nas discovered by Madame Wu, and we didn't know the Aharonov-Bohm effect, which\ndemonstrated that the electromagnetic field is less important than the\nelectromagnetic potential. In the mid-1970s as well, Jim Simons and C.N. Yang\nshowed that particle theory is completely geometric. Both of these\ndevelopments are little known among the public. That the Graph, the Wall, and\nthe Tome and these recent foundational developments are unknown is evidence\nthat something is off in how we communicate science and hand down our\nknowledge.\n\nThe aims of Graph, Wall, Tome lie in an extremely focused presentation of its\ncore elements, improving and expanding upon the originals where necessary, to\nchart the path to learning fundamental physics for as many willing people as\ncan be reached.\n\nBeyond Graph, Wall, Tome is the Search, the search for a theory of everything.\nVentures that may be considered part of the search are String Theory, Loop\nQuantum Gravity, Garrett Lisi's E8, and Eric Weinstein's Geometric Unity.\nGraph, Wall, Tome can serve as a road to participate in the Search, though it\nshould not be confused for the Search, and the Search should not be confused\nfor it.\n\n### Prime Directive[edit]\n\n> A request:\n>\n> Try to draw the lines through the three. View it as a unified idea:\n>\n> The Paragraph gets edited,\n>\n> The Wall gets defaced and graffitied,\n>\n> The Sacred Tome gets rewritten.\n>\n> But follow the skeins through each.\n>\n> The Graph points to the Wall,\n>\n> And the Wall to the Tome,\n>\n> And the Tome leads to the Search.\n\n### Graph[edit]\n\nThe Graph is a paragraph from Edward Witten's 1987 paper Physics and Geometry\nat the bottom of page 20. In language it concisely encodes the general\nstructure of reality:\n\n> If one wants to summarize our knowledge of physics in the briefest possible\n> terms, there are three really fundamental observations:\n>\n> (i) Spacetime is a pseudo-Riemannian manifold [math]\\displaystyle{ M\n> }[/math], endowed with a metric tensor and governed by geometrical laws.\n>\n> (ii) Over [math]\\displaystyle{ M }[/math] is a vector bundle\n> [math]\\displaystyle{ X }[/math] with a non-abelian gauge group\n> [math]\\displaystyle{ G }[/math].\n>\n> (iii) Fermions are sections of [math]\\displaystyle{ (\\hat{S}_{+} \\otimes\n> V_{R}) \\oplus (\\hat{S}_{-} \\otimes V_{\\tilde{R}}) }[/math].\n> [math]\\displaystyle{ R }[/math] and [math]\\displaystyle{ \\tilde{R} }[/math]\n> are not isomorphic; their failure to be isomorphic explains why the light\n> fermions are light and presumably has its origins in representation\n> difference [math]\\displaystyle{ \\Delta }[/math] in some underlying theory.\n>\n> All of this must be supplemented with the understanding that the geometrical\n> laws obeyed by the metric tensor, the gauge fields, and the fermions are to\n> be interpreted in quantum mechanical terms.\n\nScan of the original paragraph:\n\nImplicit in each respective section is:\n\n  1. Spin-2 Force Field for Gravity, the Einstein Field Equations\n  2. Spin-1 Vector Boson Theory, Yang-Mills-Maxwell Equations\n  3. Spin-1/2 Matter Theory, Dirac Equation\n\nThese are the gauge fields referred to by the last sentence.\n\nNote that the quantum (e.g. quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, quantum\nmeasurement, etc...) is mentioned only after the key geometric insights.\n\n### Wall[edit]\n\nThe following image is carved into a wall at Stony Brook University, completed\nand unveiled in May 2015. It contains many equations and mathematical results\nthat have contributed to the human understanding of reality. In specific\nrelation to the Graph, there are the Einstein Field Equations (item 5), the\nYang-Mills Equations (item 9), and the Dirac Equation (item 7).\n\nClick here for an interactive version of the Wall\n\n  * The Wall\n\n  * Legend\n\n### Tome[edit]\n\nThe Road to Reality  \n---  \nInformation  \nAuthor| Sir Roger Penrose  \nLanguage| English  \nGenre| Physics  \nPublisher| Vintage  \nPublication Date| 9 January 2007  \nPages| 1136  \nISBN-13| 978-0679776314  \n  \nThe Tome is The Road to Reality by Nobel laureate Sir Roger Penrose, which\ncontains a comprehensive account of the physical universe, as it was\nunderstood circa 2007, in 34 chapters spread over 1000 pages with diagrams and\nequations. For the information contained in the Graph and the Wall, this book\nserves as an index of concepts to chart a path of learning. It also\ndemonstrates how these concepts can be explained and arranged to encourage\nproductive learning.\n\n  * Road to Reality by Sir Roger Penrose on Amazon\n\nThe community is reading through the tome and gathering relevant resources on\nthe wiki.\n\n  * The Portal Book Club - We have a weekly group that meets to talk about this book. Come join us in Discord!\n  * Community study notes\n  * Reference material by chapter\n\n## Core Sub-projects[edit]\n\nThe essence of Graph, Wall, Tome is viewing each as part of a singular idea.\nWhat content is common among them is what should be expanded, and their unique\ncontent should be promoted if it is a part of fundamental physics toolkit, or\nremoved if it isn't.\n\n### Graph-Wall-Tome Connection[edit]\n\n  * Decoding the Graph-Wall-Tome Connection - What are the common themes that appear in the Graph, the Wall, and the Tome? What do they point to?\n\n### Editing the Graph\n\nEditing the Graph - Though the original Graph aptly summarizes our physical\nknowledge, there are some minor alterations and additions to be made in order\nfor it to accurately capture current physics.\n\n### Defacing the Wall\n\nDefacing the Wall - Update and improve the wall so that it is conciliant with\nfundamental theoretical physics. Remove extraneous information and reorganize\nto make clear the relations between underlying principles.\n\n### Rewriting the Tome\n\nRewriting the Tome - For everything that is in the new Graph and Wall, write\ntheir elaboration and explanation. Received wisdom does not need to be\naccepted wholesale, the original Tome is a good example but not the ideal\nsolution.\n\n### Resources[edit]\n\n  * Master Planning Doc\n  * Drive Folder\n  * List of Reference Material\n\n## Other Sub-projects[edit]\n\n  * Studying the Tome - The Tome can be intimidating. This problem can be solved 1) by creating resources that make it easier to digest its content and 2) by going through the chapters together.\n  * Holonomy Project (Stalled) - The goal is to create visualizations for the effect known as \"holonomy\", whereby parallel transporting a vector around a loop in a curved space leads to the vector changing upon returning to the start of the loop. How the vector changes orientation/position in space is the holonomy of that loop in that space. This effect reveals deep information about the curvature of the space itself.\n\n## Archived Sub-projects[edit]\n\n  * Climbing the Cliff (Archived) - Create a learning guide through The Road to Reality.\n  * Deface the Wall (Completed) - Cam and boqu made a new wall that's interactive.\n  * Geometry Project (Archived) - The aim is to create and collect resources related to Frederic P. Schuller's lecture series titled \"Lectures on Geometrical Anatomy of Theoretical Physics\" that provides a great introduction to geometrical concepts that are essential for the Graph, Wall, Tome project.\n  * Interactive Wall (Completed) - Demp and boqu made a wall that you can pan and zoom and click on!
