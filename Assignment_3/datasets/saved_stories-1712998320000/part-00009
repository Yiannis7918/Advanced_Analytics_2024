But not always.\n\nThis week, meet a reader we'll Regomize as \"Frank\" who once worked for a\nvendor of high-end, mission-critical storage arrays \u2013 the sort of stuff that's\nso important customers pay millions a year for support contracts that\nguarantee storage ninjas will parachute in to fix problems ASAP.\n\nA few years back, Frank was in the office on a Friday morning when one of\nthose support contracts was activated, and an email landed asking if anyone\ncould get on a plane to visit a client ASAP.\n\nAt the time, Frank was not a designated storage support ninja \u2013 so he ignored\nthe request.\n\nBut an hour later another email landed: Frank's employer was offering a bonus\nto whoever took the job.\n\nWith nothing planned for the weekend, and confidence he could do a decent job\nas a storage ninja, Frank agreed to do it.\n\nHe quickly found himself on a plane bound for a significant European city,\nwhere the Department of Justice operated a storage array.\n\nThe job had something to do with a disk failure that had inconveniently struck\nmere days before a local court was due to hand down its decision in a case so\nsignificant that Frank said \"half of Europe's media had descended on the city\nto wait for the verdict.\"\n\nWhile the disk failure was a minor matter, the Justice Department's tech team\nhad panicked. Frank's employer told them not to touch a thing. And when he\narrived, Frank received the same instruction \u2013 plus orders to ensure he was\navailable on immediate standby in case of further problems.\n\nThat meant finding a hotel to crash in for the weekend.\n\nRemember that waiting horde of media? They'd booked all the hotels in town.\n\nFrank could not find a room out in the burbs, nor beyond. But the client was\nhaving none of that. They wanted him within short strolling distance of the\narray in case its issues threatened to derail justice.\n\nA call to his employer's corporate travel team yielded news that one room\nmeeting the terms of the support contract remained available: a deluxe suite\nin a top global hotel chain.\n\nFrank looked up the price on the hotel's web site.\n\n\"It cost over $5,000 per night,\" he told On Call, confessing \"I'd never seen\nanything quite like it.\" And he hasn't since.\n\nOne of the gold-framed mirrors alone was \"close to the size of my room in the\nshared house I lived in back home.\"\n\nThe room service menu was splendid. So was the 12-seat dining table at which\nhe could consume whatever he summoned.\n\nLest you think Frank was wallowing in lazy luxury, the suite also had a\nseparate office \"with an enormous wooden desk.\"\n\nFrank got to spend the whole weekend in that suite and quite enjoyed it \u2013 even\nif he was never able to fully indulge himself, given the client was paying him\nto spring into storage ninja mode.\n\nAnd then the dream of hanging around in five star luxury doing nothing died.\nThe court handed down its decision on Monday, fixing the array took five whole\nminutes, and Frank was on a plane home and back at his very non-luxurious desk\nby Tuesday.\n\nWhen he arrived, he gained two things.\n\nOne was the promised bonus payment.\n\nThe other was a marvelous memory of \"a very decent weekend.\"\n\nIn his mail to On Call, Frank pointed out his story is a rare example of an IT\npro coming out ahead after a tech support incident. If you have had a\nsimilarly pleasant time while on a job, click here to send On Call an email\nand we may celebrate your success on a future Friday. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * On Call\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * On Call\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Disaster recovery\n\n#### More about\n\n63 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * On Call\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * On Call\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Disaster recovery\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Techie saved the day and was then criticized for the fix\n\nOn Call You can prove them wrong, but they'll still get you on a non-\ntechnicality\n\nOn-Prem8 days | 142\n\n#### Do not touch that computer.
