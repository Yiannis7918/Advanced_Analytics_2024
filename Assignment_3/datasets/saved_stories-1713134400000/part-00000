Toti, Captain, USN (Ret.)\n\nA U.S. Naval Academy midshipman endures legendary tongue lashings and\nbanishment to a broom closet from the Father of the Nuclear Navy.\n\nThe time was about 1900, after a series of very long days. Like the others,\nthis day was filled with tests and interviews, hours of mental intensity\ninterrupted by hours of mind-numbing boredom. I was a first-class midshipman\nat the U.S. Naval Academy, and this was the singular event that would\ndetermine the course of my professional life.\n\nFor the previous few hours a combination of fatigue and nervous energy had\nbeen building, and I had become riveted, torn between the awe of the moment\nand fear of screwing this up.\n\nWe had heard many tales about what I would soon encounter. Most of these\nstories were presumed to be tall tales.\n\nFor example, several different renditions of the \"make me mad\" story had been\ncirculating, where Admiral Hyman Rickover dared a midshipman to do something\nthat would anger him, purportedly to see how willing the midshipman would be\nto follow an order. Some midshipmen were said to have complied by clearing the\nadmiral's desk with a single arm sweep. Others reportedly destroyed a valued\nsubmarine model by throwing it out the window.\n\nThen there were the various \"confinement\" tales of being locked up in a small\nspace or a tiny closet for hours. This apparently was one of the admiral's\nfamous tests for claustrophobia, to see if the midshipman had what it would\ntake to become a submarine officer.\n\nThe only anecdote I heard from our current round of interludes had supposedly\ninvolved a classmate of mine just a few hours earlier. As the breathless rumor\nwent, the admiral had been berating him for a particularly poor performance in\na certain course of study.\n\n\"What would your mother think if she knew you were goofing off like this?\" the\nadmiral had supposedly asked my classmate, who reportedly replied, \"My\nmother's dead.\" The admiral's alleged response: \"Well, it's a goddamn good\nthing she is, or she would die of embarrassment.\"\n\nThis was how the legends usually spread. Most of them were unbelievably over-\nthe-top. Each was uncorroborated.\n\nThe Dreaded Teetering Chair\n\nI had been running through my potential reaction to these various scenarios\nwhen it happened. I was ushered in to see the \"Kindly Old Gentleman,\" the KOG\nof nuclear-power lore.\n\nThe year was 1979. Since the admiral was born in 1900, it was never difficult\nto calculate his age. The man was 79 and of almost mythical stature. It would\nbe like standing before Halsey. Or Nimitz.\n\nNo, wait.\n\nHe was the nuclear Abraham Lincoln, the man who set the naval atom free.\n\nI walked into his office, and something seemed vaguely familiar. I couldn't\nquite place it, but I had witnessed this scene before. I looked around,\nsearching for a clue of why I had this sudden bout of dreamlike familiarity.\n\nAnd as my backside hit the seat of a sadistically teetering wooden chair\n(designed, it was said, to keep the midshipman off-balance, the first of the\nrumors I could now actually validate), it hit me.\n\nThe room was straight out of the holiday movie It's a Wonderful Life. He was\nMr. Potter, and I was George Bailey. He was about to offer me a job and hand\nme a cigar.\n\nAnd then the admiral\u2014without ever looking up\u2014muttered the only words I would\nhear during Round One of \"Toti versus the Admiral.\"\n\n\"I can't use a philosophy major with a 3.0 average. Get out.\"\n\nMy assigned shepherd, a prospective commanding officer (PCO) student, grabbed\nmy elbow and yanked hard enough to overcome my inertia. Suddenly, we were\nstanding outside the admiral's office, the visit having lasted less than 30\nseconds.\n\nAs the door closed behind me, I broke through the mental fog enough to\nproclaim, \"But I'm a physics major!\"\n\nClearly weary of playing advocate to a bunch of wide-eyed midshipmen, he led\nme off to parts unknown. He pointed to a door and said, \"I'll see what I can\ndo. Wait in here.\"\n\nWaiting Game\n\nMy holding pen was a very small office with bare walls and dust and filled\nnearly to capacity by a large metal desk. After a couple of the most\nexcruciatingly tedious hours of my life, the door opened and the same\ncommander said, \"Come.\"\n\nWe retraced our steps down the now-familiar corridor into the admiral's\noffice, and I threw myself back onto that demon of a chair.\n\nAdmiral Rickover was gazing hard at a file, occasionally muttering to himself.\nI was surprised how old and frail the great man looked.\n\nHis desk was stacked high with files of various sizes. I could barely see him\nbehind this morass. After what seemed an eternity, again without looking up,\nhe said, \"You got a C in philosophy.\n\nWhy?\"\n\nThat damned philosophy again!\n\nThus began my rant, which went something like this: \"My professor was a\nproduct of Yale University and didn't believe in grades. He would frequently\nsay 'I can lead you to philosophy but I can't make you think.' Our grade was\ndependent on the number of papers we submitted, rather than the quality of our\nwork. While other students submitted four two-page papers to get an A, I\nsubmitted one very good, 60-page paper, essentially daring him to give me a C.\nAnd he did. I gambled and lost.\"\n\nI could see the rage starting to build. I think it started somewhere in his\nneck, but maybe it started lower than that. I couldn't really tell, because\nhis lower regions were obstructed by the stack of papers. By the time this\npassion had risen to his head, it had grown to what can only be called\nRickoverian proportions.\n\nAnd his eyes!\n\nThe fire in his eyes was not that of an old man. This was a young, visceral\nanger.\n\n\"That's bullshit!\" He stood halfway up. Spittle shot out of his mouth as he\nyelled. Summarizing a much longer tirade, the gist of what he screamed was:\n\"I've heard a lot of bullshit in my day, but I have never, ever heard such\nbullshit before! I want you to know, young man, that you now hold the bullshit\nrecord! Get out of here! Get the hell out of my office!\"\n\nAs we walked out, it occurred to me that I had just been cursed out by Abraham\nLincoln.\n\nAnd I had earnestly, simple-mindedly, stupidly, wondered what I could have\nsaid or done to earn such wrath. I also honestly began to wonder if I really\nhad the stuff he was looking for. Would I be accepted into the program that\nwas, at that time, the most prestigious the Navy had to offer?\n\nInto the Closet\n\nI followed the PCO down the hall to what I presumed would be the same office,\nand to my surprise, when I stared through the door, I was looking into: a\ncloset! The closet of legend! I would now have the honor of referring to\nmyself as one of the \"closet survivors!\"\n\n\"In there,\" the PCO said, and then left.\n\nI wondered about the criteria for putting malcontents in the last barren\noffice as opposed to this closet. My Catholic upbringing provided the answer.\nI concluded that the office was sort of a nuclear purgatory\u2014saved for those\ninnocents who were guilty only of original sin, that is, those who, through no\nfault of their own, were simply stupid by birth.\n\nThe closet, on the other hand, was reserved for those truly despicable\ncharacters who had actively if not knowingly sinned against him, those who\nwere actively stupid, not merely passively so. It all made sense, in a\nnuclear-justice sort of way.\n\nBut it wasn't the kind of closet I had imagined when hearing that miscreants\nhad been \"banished to the closet.\" In my mind, the place of banishment was a\ncoat closet or a storage room of some sort. Instead, my current station was\nactually one of those janitorial closets with brooms and bad smells and a deep\nsink.\n\nFor almost two hours I considered my plight while pondering the intangibles of\nthis closet. I contemplated the fine art of dust-mop construction. I\nremembered the many times I had been trusted with operating such equipment in\nmy first real job (when I was still too young to drive), sweeping and mopping\nfloors. And although I was successfully killing time, I was completely missing\nthe point.\n\nThe Epiphany\n\nMaybe it was because of the boredom, or maybe a couple of stray neurons in my\nbrain collided in a freak (fission-like) accident. But eventually I began to\nthink.\n\nI traced the sequence of events in my life that had led to this day. I began\nto recall the drive that caused me to toss off the constrained dreams of a\nyoung steel-town boy and apply for an appointment to the Academy. And, while\nsearching for my motivation, I began to ponder my heritage.\n\nMy grandparents were immigrants who escaped from Italy to avoid the unhappy\nfate of a poor dirt farmer in a poor dirt land. At one point, my father's\nfather found employment in his new homeland by digging ditches for a living,\nhappy to drill sewer lines through solid Ohio sandstone with nothing more than\na pick ax and a hard steel shovel. My mother's father had toiled his entire\nlife shoveling coal and working the steel mills.\n\nI remembered that even at a very early age I understood the travails of a hard\nlife. And so, while still just a young boy, I made a commitment to myself that\nfor me it would be different. And suddenly, there in that janitor's closet,\namong all those mops and brooms, I had an epiphany.\n\nSo when the door finally opened, I rose from my deep sink sofa and walked into\nthe admiral's office with confidence. \"Are you ready to tell me the truth?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"Admiral, it doesn't matter what grade I got in philosophy. What mattered is\nthat I could have worked harder, but didn't. And by not giving my best effort,\nI betrayed myself, and I betrayed the investment the country was placing in\nme.\" Although I didn't say it, I also knew I had betrayed my past.\n\nAnd amazingly, for the very first time, the admiral looked at me.\n\nThe rage was gone. The fire was gone. And\u2014it was now after 2300\u2014all I saw was\nan old man with the weight of the greatest submarine force in the world on his\nshoulders.\n\n\"That's right,\" he said. \"If you give less than you're able to, you'll let\neveryone down\u2014me, your ship, your Navy, and your country. I can't use people\nlike that. I can only use people who have the courage and discipline to give\nall they've got.\"\n\n\"I can be one of those people, Admiral.\"\n\n\"You'd better be, or you'll never survive my program.\"\n\nAnd that is how I was accepted into Admiral Rickover's nuclear training\nprogram.\n\nI've since commanded one of the submarines the admiral brought into this\nworld. And I've served as commodore of a submarine squadron.\n\nAnd after all these years, I'm still not sure if Admiral Rickover intended for\nthat simple janitor's closet to serve as his Mecca of wisdom and humility.\n\nWas that confinement merely a sadistic ruse, as some have said, or did he\nreally intend for those cleaning tools to be symbols of what my life might\nhave been\u2014tangible touchstones to our collective past?\n\nI hear people frequently say that the admiral's methods were trivial or petty,\nbut I don't believe that. I'm one of those who think there was a method to his\nmadness.\n\nAfter all, I found truth in a closet.\n\nAnd in so doing, I found myself.\n\nNOTE: This article was originally published in the US Naval Institute\nProceedings.
