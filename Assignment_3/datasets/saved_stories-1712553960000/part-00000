The airline\nconfirmed it was responsible for maintenance of such parts.\n\n\"We apologise for the inconvenience of their delay, but place our highest\npriority on ultimate safety for our customers and employees,\" a statement\nsaid.\n\nThe plane was manufactured in 2015 according to regulator Federal Aviation\nAdministration (FAA) records, and the 737-800 is an earlier generation of the\n737 from the latest Max model.\n\nBoth aircraft are powered by CFM56 engines - a joint venture between General\nElectric Aerospace and Safran Aircraft Engines.\n\nThe FAA said the Boeing aircraft was towed to the gate after landing.\n\nBoeing declined to comment when approached by BBC News, referring questions to\nSouthwest for information about the airline's plane and fleet operations.\n\nSouthwest said it would fly passengers on another plane to Houston about three\nhours behind schedule.\n\nBoeing has been under scrutiny following a dramatic mid-air blowout in\nJanuary, in which passengers on the flight from Portland, Oregon, to\nCalifornia narrowly escaped serious injury.\n\nOn Friday, it was announced Boeing paid $160m (\u00a3126m) to Alaska Air to make up\nfor losses the airline suffered following the emergency.\n\nRegulators temporarily grounded nearly 200 Boeing 737 Max 9 jets after a door\nplug fell from the Alaska aircraft shortly after take-off.\n\nBoeing has been trying to repair its reputation for years after crashes in\n2018 and 2019 involving a different version of the 737 Max plane killed 346\npeople.\n\nIts popular 737 Max planes were subsequently grounded globally for more than\n18 months.\n\nWatch: 'Trip from hell': On board flight during mid-air blowout\n\n## Key questions behind plane's mid-air blowout\n\nCompanies\n\nSouthwest Airlines\n\nBoeing\n\nInternational Business\n\nRelated\n\n## Can troubled Thames Water avoid collapse?\n\n2 days ago\n\nBusiness\n\n## Behind the McDonald's boycott controversy\n\n2 days ago\n\nBusiness\n\n## Thames Water troubles swell as parent firm defaults\n\n2 days ago\n\nBusiness\n\nMore\n\n2 days ago\n\n## Ibiza locals living in cars as party island sees rents soar\n\n\"All the work you could want, but there isn't anywhere to live,\" say those\nstruggling on the island.\n\n2 days ago\n\nBusiness\n\n2 days ago\n\n## US jobs boom raises doubts about rate cuts\n\nEmployers added more than 300,000 jobs in March - the biggest gain in almost a\nyear.\n\n2 days ago\n\nBusiness\n\n3 days ago\n\n## Boeing pays Alaska Air $160m after mid-air blowout\n\nThe sum to the airline for losses since January reflects the ongoing fallout\nto Boeing from the crisis.\n\n3 days ago\n\nBusiness\n\n3 days ago\n\n## Samsung profits jump by more than 900% on chips\n\nChip prices recover from a post-pandemic slump while demand for AI-related\nproducts booms.\n\n3 days ago\n\nBusiness\n\n3 days ago\n\n## The rise of magnets \u2013 from surgery to outer space\n\nMagnets are central to much modern technology and firms are racing to make\nthem more efficient.\n\n3 days ago\n\nBusiness\n\n## Let us know you agree to cookies\n\nWe use cookies to give you the best online experience.\n\nPlease let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.\n\n  * No, take me to settings\n\n", "frontpage": false}
