It has brought a lot\nof clarity to my life and day-to-day activities. I get a lot of tasks done and\nimprove myself consistently as well. It has put me on the path to slaying\ncomplacency, eliminating procrastination, and fulfilling my immense potential.\nThese are four principles of how action breeds clarity, and how I implement\nthem.\n\n## 1\\. Learning by Doing\ud83d\udd17\n\nLearning by doing stops us from overthinking things. We are only human. We\nwill never be sure of every decision we make. We have an innate tendency to\noverthink and analyze situations before taking action.\n\nOverthinking leads to what is commonly known as \"analysis paralysis.\" It blurs\nour perspective, creates confusion, and stagnates our progress. Overthinking\ncreates multiple outcomes that lead to increased anxiety, dissatisfaction, and\neven paralysis. This concept; was theorized by psychologist Barry Schwartz in\nhis book \u201cThe Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less.\u201d\n\nSchwartz argues that having choices is generally considered a positive aspect\nof modern life. The abundance of options in various domains\u2014such as career\npaths and life decisions\u2014can overwhelm individuals and hinder their ability to\nmake effective decisions. We should use our time efficiently and learn in the\nprocess. Do not overthink things.\n\n## 2\\. Just-In-Time Knowledge over Just-In-Case Knowledge\ud83d\udd17\n\n\u201cJust-In-Time Knowledge\u201d refers to acquiring skills and information when they\nare immediately needed for a specific task, problem, or situation. \u201cJust-In-\nCase Knowledge\u201d refers to learning skills and information in preparation for\nfuture needs.\n\nBoth approaches have their advantages. Why is this knowledge important? A lot\nof people read, watch videos, and consume information that they are unlikely\nto put into practice. This knowledge is more of an entertainment source than\nit is a learned skill.\n\nWe are more likely to change a light bulb than apply survival tactics when\nfaced with a lion. There\u2019s nothing wrong with knowing how to survive a lion\nattack but it\u2019s very unlikely that you\u2019ll use that knowledge. People that\nprioritize this type of knowledge are also prone to procrastination. They\nfocus solely on what could happen. This keeps them in an endless cycle of\nworry and anxiety that prevents them from accomplishing the goals they\u2019ve set\nfor themselves.\n\nWe prioritize just-in-time knowledge and reference Tim Ferris, who said,\n\u201cPrefer just-in-time knowledge over just-in-case knowledge.\u201d\n\n## 3\\. Do and Reflect\ud83d\udd17\n\nGetting things done while learning relevant aspects is good for our growth.\nReflection gives us new perspectives of ourselves that allow us to analyze and\nimprove on areas we are weak.\n\nIt is important to see your goals through. Doing so staves off doubt,\ndepression, and anxiety. It builds your character in the process, putting you\nin a position to continually improve. Resist the temptation to quit or give\nup. Do not second-guess yourself by wondering if you should do something else\ninstead. Guard your mind against self-doubt and stay focused on the task at\nhand.\n\nTake action over your patterns, routines, and nuances. Don\u2019t allow complacency\nto creep in, as it can drain you of all your potential, leaving you depressed\nand unfulfilled. Adapt to changing circumstances and build on routines that\nmake you better.\n\n## 4\\. Building Confidence & Embracing the Unknown\ud83d\udd17\n\nAction involves stepping into the unknown. Embracing uncertainty allows us to\nconfront fears and doubts that hinder progress. Navigating through uncharted\nterritories is scary and unpleasant. However, doing so builds and grows\nconfidence. This confidence stems from realizing we can overcome challenges\nand learn from them.\n\nOverthinking can create worst-case scenarios that fill us with fear. Fear can\nhold you back from achieving your potential. Take the leap of faith into the\nunknown, and overcome the challenges that await you. As David Goggins says,\n\u201cEmbrace the suck!\u201d\n\nIt might not be pleasurable in the beginning, but you will learn how to deal\nwith it. You\u2019ll master how to navigate uncharted waters and come out the other\nside stronger than before.\n\n## Conclusion\ud83d\udd17\n\nAction breeds clarity and encapsulates a fundamental truth that transcends\nvarious aspects of life. It allows us to break free from the constraints of\noverthinking. We gain insights, experiences, and wisdom that lead to a clearer\nunderstanding of ourselves and our environment.\n\nThe courage to take action propels us toward our goals while fostering\nadaptability and self-confidence. Action holds the key to the clarity we seek.\n\nThe world is your oyster. Stop overthinking and act starting today.\n\nCareer Productivity Cool Tips\n\n## Who am I?\n\nPassionate about building, business, and software!\n\nI am currently building the best project management tool - I might be biased \ud83d\ude01\n\nI have a decade of experience building software and managing teams.
