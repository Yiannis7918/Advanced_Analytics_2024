It's more\nexpensive than entry-level printers, but it's a very high quality machine and\nis very reliable. I can focus on designing and making things instead of\nspending lots of time tinkering with my 3D printer.\n\nI find a lot of models on Thingiverse, Printables, and MakerWorld. I also\ndesign my own parts in OpenSCAD and Fusion360.\n\nThis page is where I log some of the things that I've printed.\n\n## 2024\n\n## Leviathan Steam Train\n\nSteam Engine Train Leviathan by mardur\n\nDetailed steam engine train loosely modeled after the number 63 Leviathan.\nMatching tender is available at https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4772254 The\nmodel is not to any scale and not an accurate replica, particularly for the\nwheel sockets and the cabin. Most parts can be printed without or only very\nlittle support. Careful, there are more than 100 pieces to the entire model.\nIf parts are to be printed multiple times, the amount is indicated in brackets\nin the filename. A standard LED can be placed inside the lantern and cables\nwill run inside the model towards the cabin. Another LED might be placed\nloosely inside the boiler to indicate the burning fire. The details in the\nmodel are designed to be printed with 0.4mm nozzle FDM at 0.2mm layer height.\nI personally printed it on an Ender 3 in PLA. Most parts will be glued in\nplace. Some parts (especially the wheels) are supposed to be attached with\nM2x20mmm screws. Any other diameter or length will not fit. Sorry about that.\nThe wheels and drive mechanism are theoretically moving, but at least for my\nprint, the tolerances are too tight for smooth movement. I am not particularly\nhappy with the wheel sockets either. I should come up with a better solution\nthere.\n\nThingiverse\n\n## Replacement Generator Cap\n\nMy cousin works for a company that supplies generators for events. They lost\none of these generator caps and asked me if I could print a new one, since\nit's quite expensive to buy a replacement. I copied the design in OpenSCAD and\nprinted it using ASA filament for strength and UV resistance.\n\n## Dune Ornithopter Model\n\nHouse Atreides Royal Ornithopter Kit Card by Iron_Man_\n\n\\----NOT MY CREATION---- originally made by Kamteix over on printables. their\npage can be found here: https://www.printables.com/model/783683-dune-house-\natreides-ornithopter-kit/files I\u2019ve included two files, one file that\u2019s\ncompact, and one for a small print bed. If you choose the compact version,\nmake sure to download one of the wing files. I recommend the long wings, but\nit\u2019s up to you. STL files soon!\n\nThingiverse\n\n## The Moon\n\nThis print took 33 hours.\n\n# Miscellaneous\n\nCable Organizer by Fuzz98\n\nThis is a cable organizer for your desk to keep all those running wires\norganized in this sleek design I made in Audodesk Fusion 360. This was printed\non the Anycubic Kobra 2 Neo Printer! This design can be printed with PLA or\nABS to make the print stronger! I will also be releasing a TPU VERSION to make\nsure cables never fall down or out of the printed part! Some tips to make this\nstronger is to print with more infill and walls!! Follow me on Thingiverse and\nLike!!! Go check out my other models!!\n\nThingiverse\n\nNASA Fabric - V2 by RileyDesigns\n\nThis is NASA fabric, it\u2019s a super satisfying sheet of hexagonal chainmail that\nyou can fidget with our display. The model isnt fragile so play till your\nhearts content. The model is fully scaleable and a full bed print was included\nso you can create your own shapes by deleating indevidual hexagones. Simply\nimport the STL raw model file into the slicer and separate the sheet into\nparts and delete the ones you don\u2019t want. For best results use a small layer\nsize, I used 0.12 mm and it worked excelent. To change the face pattern,\nadjust the \u201cBottom surface pattern\u201d I used the Concentric mode which left me\nwith a beautiful hexagonal infill pattern.&nbsp;UPDATE:New geometry makes\nupgrades this model in every way-Prints in 4 hours at .2mm-Print on either\nface-More accurate triangle reduction-Slices faster-Less lag when moving in\nslicer-Now works at .2mm layer height&nbsp;There is also a dragon scale and\nscnake scale version available on my profile, it looks amazing and is themed\nfor the year of the dragon! Its a great model to use on costumes with color\nshifting filament.\n\nMakerWorldjosteb\n\n## 2023\n\n## Desk Cable Organization\n\nMy first big 3D printing project was to organize all the cables under my desk.\nI found some of these models on Thingiverse, and I also designed a few of my\nown things in OpenSCAD.\n\nCaldigit TS3+ Plus Wall / Desk Brackets by therealmrgadget\n\nI wanted to be able to mount my Caldigit TS3+ Plus either under my desk, or on\nthe wall next to my desk. These brackets fit snuggly and allow for both wall\nand desk mounting. Please note that the fixed rubber (grey) base part of the\nTS3+ has been accommodated for in the design, so you don\u2019t have to remove it.\nThis means that one side is slightly longer than the other side. You will find\nout easy enough as it will not fit if you try it the wrong way first ;) I have\nincluded the Autodesk Fusion 360 file if you want to tweak the design further,\nas well as the Cura file if you also have an Ultimaker 3 Printer. Please\nenjoy. I hope this helps you to tidy up your desk clutter as it has for me :)\n\nThingiverse\n\nUnder Desk Cable Organizer Box with Lid by ndbroadbent\n\nI made a box to tidy up the cables under my desk. The OpenSCAD file requires\nthe BOSL2 library, which you will need to download from GitHub and install\ninto the OpenSCAD library directory for your platform: Windows: My\nDocuments\\OpenSCAD\\libraries\\ Linux: $HOME/.local/share/OpenSCAD/libraries/\nMac OS X: $HOME/Documents/OpenSCAD/libraries/ If you are just using the .3mf\nor .stl files then you don\u2019t need to worry about this, it\u2019s only for the .scad\nfile. The OpenSCAD file also has variables that you can adjust for width,\nheight, length, screw size, etc. (It\u2019s my first OpenSCAD project so the code\nis crazy, but it works!)\n\nThingiverse\n\nCable Chain \u201cSnaKe\u201d by patricio5s\n\nThis is my remix about cable Chain, SnakeChain can move in multiple\ndirections.\n\nThingiverse\n\n## Car Water Bottle Holder\n\nI designed this water bottle holder for my car in OpenSCAD.\n\n## Michaelangelo's David Bust\n\nI printed and spray-painted this David bust to display on a shelf. I paused\nthe print half way and filled it with pebbles to give it some weight.\n\nMichaelangelo\u2019s David Bust bisected at a 45 for cleanest print by K3D_Creates\n\nI cut this scan of David by Cosmo Wenman via the Scan the World project on\nMyMiniFactory at a 45 for the cleanest possible print. Fusion 360 made the\nfile too large for printing, but reduce the scale the same amount for both\nparts for your preference. Part of the reason I cut it up was to print a human\nhead sized version on my Ender 3 (hat in photo for reference) It\u2019s a very\nintricate model, but the angle I cut it at prevents supports from marring\nDavid\u2019s face. Most supports are just to hold up underneath the overhang of the\nbust above the columnar pedestal, and then sections of hair on the head\nsection. You will want supports (probably tree), and you\u2019ll want high\nresolution settings. Print to preference other than that. Maybe a brim for the\nneck part. I did not make peg holes or anything, since I just match them up as\nbest I can and cover seams with filler/primer. The shape of the model is quite\nunstable if rocked or knocked...the head is positioned forwards on the column\ninstead of on the center, so when you glue together the two parts, you\u2019ll want\nto make sure you have a VERY stable spot before you apply adhesive.\n\nThingiverse\n\n## Raspberry Pi 4 Cases\n\nI really like this Raspberry Pi case design.\n\nRaspberry Pi 4 Case - Slider Case by dtnavida better airflow by berat45\n\nI\u2019ve modded the Raspberry Pi 4 Case by dtnavida so air can flow through the\ncase to prevent overheating\n\nThingiverse\n\n## NodeMCU ESP-32S Case\n\nI've printed lots of these cases for ESP-32s around my house running\nESPresense.\n\nNodeMCU ESP-32S Case by jknorr\n\nA case for the NodeMCU ESP-32S. This case was designed for development boards\nwith a width of ~25,7mm and a length of ~48,43mm (see photos). Inspired by:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3195951\n\nThingiverse\n\n## Tri-Hex Holder For Pens, Paintbrushes, etc.\n\nTri-Hex Holder by Saiteik\n\nA holder made out of three hexagon\u2019s that was a request from my SO. The\nheights are 100mm, 120mm, 140mm. Can be used to hold various items depending\non their heights. ex: Brushes, Pencils, Pens, Markers, Long Slim Tools\n\nThingiverse\n\n## Replacement Rack Ears for Ubiquiti Switch\n\nI bought a used Ubiquiti Switch that didn't come with any rack ears. I\ndesigned and printed these little brackets so that I could mount it in my\nserver rack. The brackets prevent it from slipping out of the rack, but they\nare not strong enough to support the switch. It needs to be placed on top of\nanother rack-mounted device for support.\n\nReplacement Rack Ears for Ubiquiti Switch (No Load) by ndbroadbent\n\nI was inspired by some similar rack ears that I found on Thingiverse, but I\nhad to design my own from scratch in OpenSCAD since the other ones weren\u2019t\nquite right. I used these for a Ubiquiti PoE switch that I bought second hand,\nsince it didn\u2019t come with the original rack ears. I had to make the sides\nquite thin to fit in my rack, and I made the holes much smaller for the\nscrews. Also note that these rack ears are not designed to hold any weight.\nYou should put the router or switch on top of another device that is mounted\nusing proper rack ears. These rack ears just hold the device in place and stop\nit from moving forwards and backwards.\n\nThingiverse\n\n## Battery Organizers\n\nI printed lots of organizers for coin cell batteries, AA, AAA, 9V, etc.\n\nBattery dispenser AA & AAA by LarNil\n\nDesigned for very easy printing. AA & AAA version for gridfinity too. These 2\ndispensers each hold 18 batteries. Gridfinity versions holds 20/19 for AA/AAA.\nThe AAA dispenser can be added on top of the AA dispenser. (from version 3 AA\nadds on top of an AA dispenser and AAA on top of an AAA too). Dedicated\nstandalone models and gridfinity version available. The batteries can slide\nout from the side, be gripped from the side or directly from front (version\n4). Stacked, standalone or gridfinity, you decide! Version 2: Version 2 is\nextendable and can still be stacked. The extension holds 16 batteries. Version\n3: Added possibility to stack AA on top of AA and AAA on top of AAA. Reduced\nthe need to tap the batteries (sometimes) for them to roll down. Version 4:\nAdded dedicated standalone models. Improved grip when stacking AAA on-top of\nAA. Added small ramp on the side to prevent batteries to accidentally slide\nout. Added slot for gripping batteries directly from front. Version 5:\nImproved ramp. Gridfinity (v6 of sorts) Added gridfinity version for AA & AAA.\nNot stackable.\n\nThingiverse\n\nParameterized coin cell battery holder by Albert_dH\n\nA coin cell battery holder parameterized for the number and size of cells and\nwall thicknesses. Print to hold the cells at the bottom of their slots by\nfriction, and push them up via the bottom slot and then grab the sides from\nthe top. This design is chunkier than some but it is going to live and work in\na toolbox so the robustness is a feature. If you want to build a multi-cell\nbattery look here http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:267438 . 30 volts in the\nsize of a D-Cell! One end is marked with a hole to keep track of relative\nstate of charge or whatever.\n\nThingiverse\n\n## Orleans Board Game Organizer\n\nOrleans Organizer by MrFuFu\n\nI love this game. I hate how fiddly it is during setup. The components are a\nnightmare if all you have for organization is plastic baggies. One of my\nfriends upgraded to little tupperware containers, but those are still a pain\nto fiddle with. Fortunately for you, I got sick of it, and made this handy\norganizer. It comes with little castle themed bins for all the serfs and\nknights. Each bin has either two or three bays inside of it. There are also\ntwo bins that are crate themed for the resources The bays are sloped so that\nyou can easily draw out components. Each bin has a slide away top that snaps\ninto place, so setup and teardown is as easy as placing the bins and sliding\noff the tops. There is also an organizer for the tiles that drive the gameplay\nat the top of the board. Plenty of room in the box for all, when the game is\npacked away. Components to print: 1 Orleans-3tray.stl (Grey) 1\nOrleans-3TrayLid.stl (Grey) 2 Orleans-2Tray.stl (Grey) 2 Orleans-2TrayLid.stl\n(Grey) 1 Orleans-TileTray.stl 1 Orleans-3ResourceTray.stl (Brown) 1\nOrleans-3ResourceTrayTall.stl (Brown) 2 Orleans-3ResourceTrayLid.stl (Brown)\nEvery component is built to optimize gameplay and seamlessly transition from\nstorage to play. So, boot up your printer, toss out those plastic baggies, and\nupgrade that copy of Orleans. Enjoy!\n\nThingiverse\n\n## Curved Honeycomb Vase\n\nI printed this to try out \"Spiral vase\" mode, where it prints in one continous\nline (instead of printing one layer at a time.)\n\nCurved honeycomb vase by eggnot\n\nF.A.Q You can sell your prints on Etsy etc. Don\u2019t ask me for a permission,\ninstead read a License on a left (it\u2019s CC - Attribution SA) I don\u2019t need your\ncut. Instead if you like a model or you making a profit out of it - donate me\na small amount. License is for a 3d/STL file and NOT for a PHOTO / other\ncontent (you can\u2019t sell your prints using my photo, do your own photo of your\nprint). DESCRIPTION: Just a couple of modifiers to give Honeycomb vase(by\nradus) more stable bottom. Also i think it looks more organic. Done in Blender\n3d, .blend file is attached. [sotvl_Spiral-Vase.stl] is a solid shape. you\nshould print it in \u201cSpiralize Contour\u201d(Cura) or \u201cSpiral Vase\u201d(Slic3r). Ts is\nnot waterproof, as it will be small holes on a way up from bottom. So, it is\nnot good for water, but soil is ok. [sotvl_thick 1,2mm] - with a proper\nthickness calculation. 1mm and 2mm thick respectfully. probably waterproof...\nbut not tested by myself with a print yet. Slice and print as a usual thing,\nnot in vase mode. [sotvl_thick-Blender.stl] is thick/thin shape. should be ok\nfor usual print and waterproof, but need more testing with prints. At current\nstate, it seems it less reliable compared to sotvlthick 1,2mm. [sotvl.blend] -\nsource Blender3d file, shape and thickness can be changed there. (for advanced\nusers)\n\nThingiverse\n\n## Filament Spool Switcher & Winder\n\nThis machine can be used to wind filament onto a new spool.\n\nBambu Lab P1 / X1 / X1C / X1CC Filament Spool Switcher & Winder on Printables\n\n## Turntable for 3D Scanning\n\nI ended up using this for airbrushing.\n\nSimple Programmable Turntable for 3D Scanning (Photogrammetry) by guppyk\n\nJust a simple turntable for use in 3d scanning (actually photogrammetry) or\nanything else that you can think of. This is an easy print and all you need is\na stepper motor, three ball bearings, and an Arduino (together for\nconsiderably less than USD 10). Stepper motor 28BYJ-48 (5V 4 Phase) + ULN2003\nDriver Board (should be less than USD 2 together) Arduino (once again less\nthan USD 2 - I have been using the Arduino Nano for most of my projects but\nyou can of course just as well use an Uno) Four 608 (ZZ or RS or 2RS) ball\nbearings (once again < USD 2) Put the stepper in the mount in the center of\nthe case, connect it to the Arduino via driver board, stick the ball bearings\non the four axes, stick the feet in, and add the turn table. You are (almost)\nthere. All you need is a few lines of code adapted to your needs (which could\nbe continuous turns, moving stepwise, a stop after every 10 degrees or....).\nThe nice thing about using an Arduino is that it is fully programmable. If you\nare not familiar with writing code for the Arduino, no problem, just enter\n\u201carduino 28BYJ-48\u201d in Google. There are lots of good tutorials (and code you\ncan copy and paste) on the net. For Photogrammetry (i.e. 3D scanning without a\nlaser) all you need is a decent camera (your mobile phone camera will do) and\nsoftware (I use Meshroom - simple, free, works great). You won\u2019t even need a\ntripod. Have your object turn 360 degrees and take 30-50 pictures. Do this\nagain from a higher viewpoint. Have the object lie flat on its back/front and\nrepeat. Once again, it\u2019s simple and there are lots of good tutorials on the\nnet. Hope you like it. Enjoy! ...and as usual, take care when handling\nelectronic equipment and no warranties whatsoever ;-)\n\nThingiverse\n\n## Tablet Wall Mount\n\nLenovo Tab M10 Plus second gen wall mount case by mikedhoore\n\nWall mount case for a lenovo M10 plus second gen tablet\n\nThingiverse\n\n## LED Strip Channel Holders for Vegepod\n\nI designed and printed these clips to hold an LED strip grow light.\n\n## Pendant Lamps\n\nI printed 8 of these for lights around our house. They look really nice.\n\nPimp your pendant lamp! by justinwille9666\n\nPimp your light with these easy to print cubic lamp shades.&nbsp;Print\nSettings:line width: 0.6mm (works fine with 0.4 nozzle)spiral vase: onbottom\nlayers: 7layer height: 0.16&nbsp;They are working with every lamp with an\nexternal thread around 4cm &nbsp;example: https://www.amazon.de/Linkind-\nLampenaufh%C3%A4ngung-H%C3%B6henverstellbar-Pendelleuchte-\nLampenhalterung/dp/B094HY8VC6/ref=asc_df_B094HY8VC6/?tag=googshopde-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=526495320941&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=15052909721952127031&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9116154&hvtargid=pla-1379022261744&psc=1&th=1&psc=1&nbsp;\n\nMakerWorld\u5c0f\u53ae\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4\n\n## Glass Sphere Lamp Adapters\n\nI printed these adapters so that an existing light socket would fit into a new\nspherical glass lampshade.\n\n## Angled Holder for Nintendo Switch Dock\n\nThis dock holder makes it a easier to take out my Nintendo Switch from the TV\ncabinet.\n\n## Bolt Thumb Screws for Drill Press Vise\n\nI use these to quickly reposition or remove a vise from my drill press.\n\n## Alien Egg Chair\n\nThis was designed for a chicken egg, but I scaled it up to fit an ostrich egg.\nNow my wife can display her ostrich egg on a shelf in her office.\n\nEgg Chairs by DaveMakesStuff\n\nKeep your eggs safe in these comfy chairs. Or scale them up to hold melons or\nsmall children. See here for video: https://youtu.be/pjC-_G7KGnA There are\nfour sizes of chairs to ensure that even your little eggs get a good view.\nOriginal size files are intended for resin printing, but they can be scaled up\nfor FDM printing. This download includes one chair. See here to download the\nset: https://than.gs/m/912766 Oh, and I was just kidding about using the Egg\nChairs for small children. Don\u2019t do that.\n\nThingiverse\n\n## Cat Key Hook\n\nCat key hook by aarruti\n\nA simple hook for keyring where the cat come out of the box when the tail is\npulled. Due to problems on the platform I had to create a new account to\nupload this model again. Do not hesitate to make many cycles of opening and\nclosing the box to break-in the mechanism.

For engineering,\nwe don \u0301t need such designs like these: https://german.alibaba.com/product-\ndetail/wooden-wall-mount-vinyl-record-shelf-on-wall-phono-album-lp-display-\nshelf-record-rack-62047627390.html Thinking more minimalstic, I created a\nmodel wich weighs only 14g (100% infill). Attach the model with 2 countersunk\nhead screws or use some glue. Note: Print the model with the long side in\ndirection of the z-axis, so the most bending stiffness is along the printing\nlines. Thank you and have some fun with the prints! Cheers Marlon\n\nThingiverse\n\n## Fluxx Card Game Box\n\nImproved fit Fluxx box w/ Firefly, Nature and Holiday lids by randerson_1983\n\nMade slight changes to Wizzer2801\u2019s deck box file, removed little artefact on\nside of box (looks like from the X poking through) and have added bumps as\nspacers onto where the lid is placed. Having printed 4 of these, i found the\nlid was loose every time. This design fixed that for me. Using rounded bumps,\nif you find the lid too tight now, it should be easy to sand a little off to\nget your perfect fit. I have also uploaded lids I made for Firefly Fluxx,\nNature Fluxx and Holiday Fluxx. Enjoy. Many thanks to Wizzer for the sharing\nthe original designs! Much love.\n\nThingiverse\n\n## Replacement Pool Vaccum Adapter\n\nMy cousin asked me to fix this thing for his pool vacuum.\n\n## Vaccuum hose adapters\n\nI designed adapters for my shop vac so that I could extend the hose and attach\na cyclonic separator.\n\n## Rubik's Cube Tissue Box\n\nPLA was a bad choice. The tissue box started warping and the color pieces fell\noff when my wife parked her car in the sun. I might try printing this again\nusing ASA filament (UV resistant.) I might also print the color pieces\nslightly smaller and super glue them (instead of hammering them in.)\n\nTissue Box Rubik\u2019s Cube by McCheezy\n\nHey guys, I designed a Rubik\u2019s cube tissue box. If you don\u2019t have OCD, you can\nmix the color plates ;-) You can also use it for other things like a money\nbox. Edit: A user asked for stp-files.

This way you\ncan loosen the previous winding a bit to make it easier to get underneath with\nthe clip to attach it. Do it a few times and it will be done in a few\nseconds.&nbsp;Important:Make sure your filament is not over extruded. This can\ncause the clip to not work as well as it could.I recommend regular PLA, Silky\nPLA has a poorer layer adhesion which can cause the clip to break.&nbsp;Tip:\n2.85mm filament? Just scale the clip in your slicer to 160%.The most important\nfeatures in short:Only requires about 1g of filament and prints in about\n7min.Does not attach to the spool. This makes it compatible with any filament\nspool and they can still be stacked easily.Has a grip for easier handling.A\n&#34;scoop&#34; to get under the previous winding better.Bends the filament\njust slightly and therefore doesn&#39;t damage it.A separate version with a\nhole in the grip to hang it up.The different clips explained\nseparately:&nbsp;The classic: Unchanged because the vast majority are\nperfectly satisfied with this clip.The stronger clip: If you use Silky PLA or\nanother filament with poorer layer adhesion, this scoop will be more\nsturdy.The clip for beasty filament: Filaments like PC are very slippery and\nstiff at the same time. The previous turn is clamped much stronger and\nprevents slipping.The closed clips: If the filament is fed into a Bowden tube\nthese clips can stay on the filament. The hole is shaped so that the filament\nwhen it is straight simply slips through, if it is wound on the spool it holds\nthe filament by its bending.There are these two versions, depending on which\none you like better in handling.&nbsp;Remix?

The STL model is 16 cm in the wide\ndimension and about 6.4 cm in the other. The black parts of the icon are 0.4\nmm higher than the colored parts. I printed most of it with gray filament,\nswitched to black filament for the last couple layers, and then painted the\ncolors on. Turning on the \u201cironing\u201d setting if your slicer has one will\nproduce a better finish. You might be able to print inlays for the colored\nbits and glue them on, so I\u2019ve included STLs for them. I have not tried this\nmyself, though, so no guarantees.\n\nThingiverse\n\nYoshi by InventingJ\n\nMy first organic and multi color model :) Please tell me if i need to do\nanything differently ;) (it would help me alot.)

I have a bunch of media and dongles and wanted a nice\nrectangular \u201cplot\u201d to arrange them on. Though this isn\u2019t a remix, this was\ndefinitely inspired by Lalo_Solo\u2019s USB SD and MicroSD holder for wide USB\nsticks. Prior to making this model I used two of his model, mirrored one, and\nglued the two together on the lengthier side. This will hold: 24 USB-A devices\nof fairly-wide variety (see photo) 16 SD cards 29 MicroSD cards Dimensions\nLength: 124mm Width:8 4mm Height: 18mm Estimated Resources (using Cura 5.2.1):\nPrint Time: 17hrs, 5min (with 50mm/s print speed) Material Use: 124g, 41.46m\n(I generally print with 3-line walls.

If you\nprint 4 lids, you can slide them up and down to open up the different spaces.\nYou can start with all 4 lids at the top and with an empty row of spaces at\nthe bottom, then slide one lid down each day to reveal the next space. I think\nthat this design makes it more usable since the lids are self-contained and\ndon\u2019t stick out when you slide them up. The trade-off is that you only have 4\nusable rows instead of 5, since you need an empty row to slide the lids into\nat the start. I personally printed this at 120% scale, but you can choose your\nown scale that fits your needs. ORIGINAL SUMMARY: With this pill organiser\nyou\u2019re able to store and organise up to 35 days of pills. The wells in this\nare designed to be larger to hold bigger and/or more medications. This is\ninspired by https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:758586 but built from the ground\nup myself. All credit for the idea goes to LoboCNC. I needed to make a new\nversion of it for myself as the original one was hilariously small for the\npills I take every day. Each compartment is 18mm wide, 18mm deep, and 24mm\nlong. The whole thing overall is 145mm W x 160mm L x 21mm D You will need to\nprint 2 each of the S lid and T lid, then one each of everything else. This\nhas been designed with 0.35mm clearance.

The gauge number refers to the size of the diameter cut-out\nnext to it. I printed it in PLA but the finest AWG 25-30 are pretty closed.\nIts also a good print for testing your printer and settings Use: With electric\nwire, remove the plastic insulation because you only measure the core The\nhorizontal gap at the outermost point is the diameter which is referred to by\nthe gauge number. This is where the wire is placed to determine its size. The\ncircular section acts as a run through for wire that is capable of fitting\nthrough the gap. It allows the wire to be easily removed after passing through\nthe gap. When googling \u201cwire gauge\u201d you can find other information and the\nsizes of the AWG standard. I appreciate if you upload your print\n\nThingiverse\n\nFin Vases Square by DaveMakesStuff\n\nThe radial fins on this vase creates interesting affects when printed with\nmultcolor filament.

He\nhas since made a thingiverse account and shared his files here:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3073646 3 identicle parts that slide\ntogether in a satisfying way to create a cube. Once assembled it needs to be\nheld and moved in a specific direction to seperate. clearance between the\nparts is around .3mm allowing for smooth movement without binding. Since these\nparts have faces that slide on eachother printing in a higher resolution might\nbe beneficial to the tactile feel. this design is intended to be printed\nwithout supports utilizing the bridge functions of your printer. i have left\nsome extra tolerance at the bridge location to account for some sagging.\nBridge length is 22mm.

If you\u2019re not sure which to choose, I\u2019d recommend starting with the\n\u201cmedium\u201d size.&nbsp;After printing, you\u2019ll want to place the cable within the\ngroove at its halfway point, close the lid (which is intentionally designed to\nclose tightly), wind up the cord clockwise using the handle, and then extend\nby simply grabbing the cable by both ends.&nbsp;Update\n2023-09-13:&nbsp;Alternative smooth-sided versions of all three sizes have now\nbeen added, and also the handle design was slightly adjusted to add a small\nfillet and chamfer to decrease the bridge distance.

Shortened the cutter as an optional detachable clip-on (screws\nno longer needed) to fit a 230mm length spool hub. Misc: Print both parts\nnumber 1 and 2 twice, then the optional cutter part number 3 once if required.\nThe cutter can be printed on a 230mm bed else align the cutter 45 degrees to\nthe bed also take note of its flat surface. The cutter has been modified to\nfit loosely in the holder slot and should not fall off or removed easily. But\nif the printing is not perfect that you have difficulties gliding the sheets\nbetween the openings, just force the cutter holes into the holder circle tabs.\nTo install, face the cutter\u2019s flat side to the front with its saw like edges\ndownwards, rotate the cutter 90 degrees side-by-side \u201cparallel\u201d to the holder,\nslide the thinner edge into the holder slot then rotate it back into\n\u201cperpendicular\u201d position.

So I embarked on making it a two piece\nholder so that it would lay a little more flat in my bag. This is my second\nattempt at making a connection and it works! I have some fine tuning to do,\nbut overall I am happy. I am uploading the parts separately so you can print\nthem or resize them as you want.

Original Post Notes This is a\nremix of https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5225016 I wanted a seatback holder\nfor flying and I found this model. I made two small modifications in\nTinkercad: I widened the area between the front and back support to hold a\nwider cased phone.
