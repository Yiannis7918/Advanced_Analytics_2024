Our results show that there\nis great potential for a new generation of digital displays where new advanced\nfeatures can be created. From now on, it\u2019s about improving the technology into\na commercially viable product,\u201d explains Professor Gao.\n\n> \u201cit\u2019s about improving the technology into a commercially viable product\u201d\n\n### Emitting variations in colour\n\nThe perovskite LEDs\u2019 can emit light in various colours, enabling a full-color\ndisplay spectrum. Traditional displays rely on separate red, green, and blue\nLEDs to produce colours, whereas this new technology achieves all colors\nwithin the visible light range using perovskite LEDs alone.\n\nDr. Chunxiong Bao, lead author of the study and an associate professor at\nNanjing University, highlights a practical application: \u201cHere\u2019s an example,\nyour smartwatch screen is off most of the time. During the off-time of the\nscreen, instead of displaying information, it can harvest light to charge your\nwatch, significantly extending how long you can go between charges.\u201d\n\nDespite these advancements, challenges remain before this technology becomes\ncommercially viable for widespread adoption. Dr. Zhongcheng Yuan, a researcher\nat the University of Oxford and co-lead author of the research, emphasises the\nneed to improve the longevity of perovskite LEDs. Currently, the screens have\na limited operational lifespan, with LEDs becoming unstable after a few hours\nof use.\n\nWith enhanced energy efficiency and integrated functionalities, perovskite LED\ndisplays could find applications in medical devices, automotive displays, and\nbeyond.\n\n  * Facebook\n\n  * Twitter\n\n  * LinkedIn\n\n  * Print\n\n#### Editor's Recommended Articles\n\n  * Must Read >> Using technology to help local authorities to counter fraudsters\n\n  * Must Read >> Technology Products and Associated Services 2 (TePAS 2) agreement update\n\n  * Must Read >> Budgeting for better care: Local authorities and technology-enabled care solutions\n\n  * TAGS\n  * Digital Technology\n\nHarriet Belderbos\n\n#### RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR\n\n### Holodeck: Changing robotics training with infinite virtual environments\n\n### MIT engineers design breakthrough flexure for muscle-powered robots\n\n### Leicester City Council cyberattack exposes sensitive data\n\n### Artificial intelligence outperforms doctors in clinical reasoning\n\n### Mobile printers: Creating value form your government or utilities\noperations\n\n### All-IP traffic: Why businesses should act now or face \u2018The switch off gold\nrush\u2019\n\n### LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply\n\n#### Related Academic Articles\n\n### Do research software engineers have research methods?\n\nMarch 26, 2024\n\n### Tuneable phononic crystals and topological acoustics\n\nMarch 25, 2024\n\n### Toward human systems integration maturity\n\nMarch 22, 2024\n\n#### Follow Open Access Government\n\n#### Technology Reports\n\n### Northwestern VLSI Lab delivers AI empowered neural processing for\nintelligent human...\n\nApril 9, 2024\n\n### Realise more value from your government or utilities operations\n\nJanuary 26, 2024\n\n### Webinar \u2013 Trends driving EV growth & how to win the...\n\nMarch 6, 2023\n\n### A Bluetooth tracking device to aid in the search for older...\n\nFebruary 9, 2023\n\n#### Technology eBooks\n\n### Alternative broadband delivery solutions\n\nQuick Launch eBook More Details\n\nDecember 13, 2023\n\n### Innovation Centre for Applied Sustainable Technologies: Accelerating the\nUK\u2019s net-zero carbon...\n\nQuick Launch eBook More Details\n\nJuly 20, 2023\n\n### Transformations to knowledge-based technology at Vestas Aircoil\n\nQuick Launch eBook More Details\n\nFebruary 3, 2023\n\n### Sensing and computing challenges for enhanced data integrity\n\nQuick Launch eBook More Details\n\nOctober 20, 2022\n\n#### Useful Resources\n\n  * Publications\n  * Stakeholders\n  * eBooks\n  * Special Reports\n\n#### Quick Links\n\n  * Contact Us\n  * About Us\n  * Our Editors\n  * Our Audience\n  * Prestige Contributors\n  * Testimonials\n\n#### Feature Articles\n\n### Supermarket EV charging destinations\n\nApril 17, 2024\n\n### What are the challenges of vaccine refrigeration?\n\nApril 16, 2024\n\n### The natural refrigerant choice and environmental considerations\n\nApril 12, 2024\n\n### Vigilant\u2019s Secure Data Sharing Platform has been described as, \u201carguably\nthe...\n\nApril 12, 2024\n\n#### Latest Publication\n\n### Open Access Government April 2024\n\nQuick Launch Publication More Details\n\nApril 8, 2024\n\n#### Latest eBook\n\n### Asia Analysis April 2024\n\nQuick Launch eBook More Details\n\nApril 17, 2024\n\nABOUT US\n\nOpen Access Government produces compelling and informative products for a wide\naudience.
