Please\nreload the page and try again.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A surge in demand for small satellites to support national\nsecurity space programs is exposing weaknesses in the U.S. space industrial\nbase, leading to supply chain issues as the military prioritizes rapid\ndeployment of constellations.\n\nIn the latest sign of the strain, defense contractor L3Harris Technologies has\nsued one of its suppliers, the aerospace firm Moog Inc., in federal court,\nalleging Moog failed to timely deliver critical satellite components and that\nparts it did provide were defective.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in late March in the U.S. District Court for the Middle\nDistrict of Florida, is the latest flashpoint in the space industry\u2019s struggle\nto adapt to the military\u2019s shift toward smaller, more affordable satellites,\nled by the Space Development Agency.\n\nEstablished in 2019, the Space Development Agency (SDA), now part of the U.S.\nSpace Force, is upending the longtime model of the military purchasing large,\nexpensive satellites at long intervals. Instead, the SDA plans to spend about\n$4 billion a year on a proliferated constellation of hundreds of smaller, less\ncostly satellites to be deployed on a more frequent cadence.\n\nThis model is placing new demands on suppliers.\n\nAccording to the March 28 complaint, L3Harris subcontracted with Moog to\nprovide satellite buses \u2014 the core hardware used to build spacecraft \u2014 and\nsoftware worth a total of $77.9 million to fulfill two prime contracts \u2014 one\nwith the SDA and another with a classified government customer.\n\nL3Harris alleges Moog repeatedly missed delivery deadlines, with satellite\nbuses arriving 11 to 13 months late. \u201cMoog\u2019s failure has also damaged\nL3Harris\u2019 credibility with its customer and placed future L3Harris business at\nsignificant risk,\u201d said the complaint.\n\nMoog eventually delivered the buses and SDA was able to launch L3Harris\u2019\nsatellites in February. In the lawsuit, L3Harris says it discovered defects in\nthe Moog hardware that \u201ccreated the potential for catastrophic loss to the\nsatellites\u201d and SDA\u2019s mission.\n\nIn response to questions from SpaceNews, a spokesperson for L3Harris said the\ncompany could not comment on ongoing litigation.\n\nAaron Astrachan, Moog\u2019s director of investor relations, said in a statement,\n\u201cWe are aware of the suit filed by L3Harris and are not intending to publicly\ncomment on the allegations at this time. However, we intend to vigorously\ndefend against the allegations, and in due time, will respond to the complaint\nin court.\u201d\n\n#### Industry struggling to ramp up\n\nThe lawsuit underscores the challenges facing the space supply chain as it\ntries to ramp up production to meet soaring demand from the military and\nintelligence community.\n\nMuch like the companies that emerged to support surging iPhone component\norders, space companies are scrambling to prove themselves as reliable, high-\nvolume suppliers of buses, hardware and software.\n\nExperts say companies in the defense industry, long accustomed to building a\nfew large, complex satellites, are adapting to the new reality of producing\nlarger quantities of smaller, cheaper spacecraft. And a surge in demand fueled\nby SDA is exposing weaknesses in segments of the space industrial base.\n\nSDA\u2019s director Derek Tournear has often said the agency\u2019s vision is to foster\na robust and diverse marketplace. Fixed price contracts are awarded to\nincentivize speed and technical maturity in bids. And Tournear has pointed out\nthat SDA\u2019s business model focuses primarily on schedule.\n\nIn an effort to provide incentives for companies to invest in production\ncapability, SDA competitively selects prime contractors that every two years\nbid for each tranche of SDA\u2019s space network in low Earth orbit, known as the\nProliferated Warfighter Space Architecture.\n\nDuring a meeting with reporters April 10 at the Space Symposium in Colorado\nSprings, Tournear noted that some suppliers have had difficulties ensuring\naccess to components and subcomponents, some of which are produced by only one\nor two vendors.\n\nA case in point is a critical satellite component made by Innoflight, the sole\nprovider of the type 1 encryption required for SDA\u2019s satellites. Type 1\nencryption is necessary for transmitting sensitive national security data, and\nit can take years to obtain National Security Agency approval for the\nspecialized hardware.\n\nTournear said Innoflight is in an extraordinary position in the market, being\nthe only provider today that has the right size and form factor type 1\nencryption that meets SDA requirements.\n\n\u201cEveryone is extremely dependent on Innoflight,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a few\nalternatives for encryption in the future, but they probably won\u2019t be ready\nuntil the Tranche 3 timeframe.\u201d Tranche 3 is the next SDA procurement of\nsatellites planned for 2025 and 2026.\n\n\u201cThe good news is that vendors are able to pivot,\u201d Tournear said. \u201cWe saw that\nwith Astra.\u201d Some SDA prime contractors selected Astra Space as a supplier of\nspacecraft propulsion. But after Astra experienced financial troubles several\nvendors had to find alternative sources for satellite thrusters, he noted.\n\nSpace Development Agency roadmap. Credit: SDA\n\nL3Harris\u2019 legal battle with Moog, meanwhile, speaks to the challenges that\nprime contractors have faced finding bus providers that can meet the\nreliability and schedule requirements.\n\nFor the next tranche of satellites L3Harris is building for SDA, projected to\nlaunch in 2025, the company switched to bus supplier Maxar Space Systems.\nOther SDA prime contractors like Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman are\nusing buses from Terran Orbital and Airbus, respectively. Other prime\ncontractors, including York Space Systems, manufacture their own buses. Rocket\nLab said it plans to develop a new bus for SDA.\n\nA new entrant in the SDA market, Sierra Space, is designing its own buses but\nusing components from Raytheon\u2019s subsidiary Blue Canyon Technologies. Sierra\nSpace won a Tranche 2 contract from SDA to produce 18 satellites.\n\nRaytheon last year won a contract as a prime contractor to produce seven\nTranche 1 satellites for SDA but later decided it could not meet the price\ntargets, Tournear said. \u201cA lot of the work is being de-scoped off of that\ncontract,\u201d he said. \u201cRaytheon, through executing that contract, realized that\nthe scope that they had chosen in the price point wasn\u2019t going to close.\u201d\n\nTournear said some of the components that Raytheon had planned to use for its\nsatellites \u201care flowing into some of the Tranche 2 vendors.\u201d\n\nSierra Space said in a statement that it has partnered with Blue Canyon for\n\u201cseveral key spacecraft components on our buses.\u201d\n\n#### Criticism from top official\n\nSupply chain problems across the space industry have drawn criticism from the\ntop U.S. Space Force acquisition official, who called on defense contractors\nto do a better job of addressing the issues.\n\nIn recent comments, Frank Calvelli, the assistant secretary of the Air Force\nfor space acquisition, chastised major primes for \u201cwhining\u201d about supply chain\nchallenges rather than taking more proactive steps to solve them.\n\n\u201cOur bigger primes whine about supply chain, and I think they are the ones\nthat have the resources and the assets to actually do something about it,\u201d\nCalvelli said in February.\n\nCalvelli said companies are still blaming the COVID-19 pandemic for their\nsupply chain woes, but he does not believe that is a legitimate excuse\nanymore.\n\nThere are, however, real problems in the space supply chain, Chad Anderson,\nmanaging partner of Space Capital, said April 9 during a panel discussion at\nthe Space Symposium.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re paying close enough attention to supply chain problems,\u201d\nsaid Anderson. \u201cIf you\u2019re an investor and you\u2019re looking at a company, pay\nextra, extra attention to the security of the supply chain. We\u2019re already\nseeing cracks in the supply chain with today\u2019s space industry. Imagine what\nit\u2019s gonna be like in three years.\u201d\n\nSeveral executives who spoke with SpaceNews on condition of anonymity noted\nthat SDA has created an entirely new market, exposing growing pains in the\nU.S. space industrial base.\n\nIt\u2019s the responsibility of the industry to sort out supply chain problems and\nadapt to the new paradigm of small satellite constellations, these sources\nsaid. But they argue that the issues seen with SDA\u2019s suppliers point to\ndeeper, systemic challenges that can\u2019t be rapidly fixed. They cautioned that\nsome of the companies capable of building the satellites that SDA seeks are\nstructured to produce single-digit numbers of spacecraft at a time, and will\nneed time and effort to ramp up production to meet SDA demands.\n\nAccording to these sources, the new growth in demand for military satellites\nhas created real bottlenecks, not just with cutting-edge subsystems like type\n1 encryption, but also with routine components like batteries, thrusters and\nsolar arrays. Prime contractors have been working to qualify multiple\nsuppliers for key components, but that process can be time-consuming given the\nexacting specifications.\n\nWith the SDA\u2019s ambitious plans to field hundreds of small satellites in the\ncoming years, experts pointed out, resolving the supply chain challenges will\nbe critical to the agency\u2019s success.\n\n### Related\n\n#### Space Development Agency confirms Rocket Lab will produce 18 satellites\nfor U.S. military network\n\nThe Space Development Agency confirmed on Jan. 8 that it awarded Rocket Lab a\n$515 million contract to build and operate 18 spacecraft that will be part of\na low Earth orbit network of military satellites.\n\n#### Lockheed Martin, Boeing win contracts to design U.S. military narrowband\ncommunications satellites\n\nLockheed Martin and Boeing each won a $66 million contract to design a\nnarrowband communications satellite to expand the existing network known as\nthe Mobile User Objective System.\n\n#### Northrop Grumman\u2019s orbital refueling port selected for U.S. military\nsatellites\n\nA satellite refueling nozzle developed by Northrop Grumman is the first to be\nselected as a preferred standard for U.S. military satellites.\n\nTagged: Blue Canyon Technologies, L3Harris Technologies, Moog, Sierra Space,\nSmall Satellites, Space Development Agency\n\n## Sandra Erwin\n\nSandra Erwin writes about military space programs, policy, technology and the\nindustry that supports this sector.
