The DateTime class is a subclass of Date and is used to handle date,\nhour, minute, second, and offset. However, The Ruby documentation also\nrecommends using the Time class instead of DateTime.\n\nThe DateTime class is still available in Ruby for backward compatibility, but\ndevelopers are encouraged to use the Time class for new projects and to\nmigrate existing code to use the Time class.\n\n# DateTime in Ruby\n\nDateTime in Ruby is a class that can handle date, hour, minute, second, and\noffset. It is a subclass of the Date class. The DateTime class can be used to\nrepresent a specific point in time with a specified offset from UTC.\n\n    \n    \n    require 'date' datetime = DateTime.new(2023, 1, 1, 12, 0, 0, '-05:00') # <DateTime: 2023-01-01T12:00:00-05:00 ((2459946j,61200s,0n),-18000s,2299161j)\n\nIn the above example, we are using the new method, passing in the year, month,\nday, hour, minute, second, and offset as arguments.\n\nAn offset refers to the difference between the local time and the Coordinated\nUniversal Time (UTC).\n\n# Time class in Ruby\n\nThere are various methods to create a Time object with the Time class.\n\n    \n    \n    t = Time.new(2024, 3, 11, 2, 2, 2, '+02:00') # => 2024-03-11 02:02:02 +0200\n\nHere also we can pass date, hour, minute, second, and offset. But in the Time\nclass we can pass the timezone object well for the offset value. Let\u2019s see the\nbelow example.\n\n    \n    \n    require 'tzinfo' # Define a timezone object tz = TZInfo::Timezone.get('Europe/Berlin') # Example timezone time_with_timezone = Time.new(2002, 10, 31, 2, 2, 2, tz) # => 2024-03-11 02:02:02 +0100\n\nWe can also create a new Time using Time.at which takes the number of seconds\nsince the Unix Epoch. The Unix Epoch refers to a specific point in time used\nas a reference for measuring time in Unix-like operating systems and many\nprogramming languages. It is defined as 00:00:00 UTC on January 1, 1970.\n\n    \n    \n    Time.at(1713169347) # => 2024-04-15 13:52:27 +0530\n\nPlease go through the docs to read more about Time class.\n\n# Let\u2019s examine when it\u2019s appropriate to use the Time and DateTime class\n\nThe DateTime class is considered deprecated because it does not consider leap\nseconds and does not track any summertime rules.\n\nIt means that it does not account for the extra second that is occasionally\nadded to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) to adjust for the Earth\u2019s uneven\nrotation, and it does not adjust for daylight saving time (DST) changes.\n\nThe lack of leap seconds can be an issue for certain applications where\nprecise timing is required. For example, in financial transactions and\nscientific research calculations.\n\nThe lack of summertime rule tracking can also be a limitation in certain\napplications where DST changes need to be considered.\n\nHowever, DateTime has some advantages over the Time class in Ruby.\n\nThe DateTime class is aware of calendar reforms, while the Time class\nimplements a proleptic Gregorian calendar and has no concept of calendar\nreform. This means that DateTime can accurately convert dates in historical\ncontexts, while Time may not be able to. To understand more about this please\ngo through this gist.\n\nWe can conclude that when handling current dates, it\u2019s preferable to utilize\nthe Time class, whereas the DateTime class is more suitable for managing\nhistorical dates.\n\nShare this post!\n\nNeed help on your Ruby on Rails or React project?\n\nBOOK A CALL\n\nIf you enjoyed this post, you might also like:\n\n#### The Ultimate Guide to Gemfile and Gemfile.lock\n\nAugust 16, 2022\n\n#### Integrate OpenAI API in Ruby applications\n\nMay 22, 2023\n\n#### How to Use Enums in Rails\n\nJanuary 5, 2022\n\nThanks!
