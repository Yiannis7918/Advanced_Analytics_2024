Overall, end users should\nhave a smoother experience out of the box with no expressed concerns about\npotential downsides in the related proposal on arch-dev-public mailing list.\n\nThis vm.max_map_count increase is introduced in the 2024.04.07-1 release of\nthe filesystem package and will be effective right after the upgrade.\n\nBefore upgrading, in case you are already setting your own value for that\nparameter in a sysctl.d configuration file, either remove it (to switch to the\nnew default value) or make sure your configuration file will be read with a\nhigher priority than the /usr/lib/sysctl.d/10-arch.conf file (to supersede the\nnew default value).\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2002-2024 Judd Vinet, Aaron Griffin and Levente Poly\u00e1k.\n\nThe Arch Linux name and logo are recognized trademarks.
