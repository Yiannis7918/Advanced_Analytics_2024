(More on this later.)\n\nScholl\u2019s catlike curiosity fuels his work to keep internet users safe. If\nsomething looks awry across the vast number of networks that AWS connects with\naround the world, Scholl susses out the sources of unusual traffic spikes. And\nhe has a rare vantage point, given that AWS connects with nearly 5,000\nnetworks total, in 184 locations globally, as of March 2024.\n\nSome of these suspicious traffic spikes can be a sign of Internet Protocol\n(IP) address \u201cspoofing,\u201d where a bad actor will impersonate another computer\nsystem\u2019s numeric internet address to launch a hard-to-track cyberattack.\n\nThe attacks are a lot like a prank caller ringing a large number of people\nfrom a fake caller ID number, fooling them into calling back and overwhelming\nthe line, at a massive scale. An IP spoof can lead to a distributed denial-of-\nservice (DDoS) attack by tricking systems into thinking a deluge of fraudulent\ntraffic is coming from one place, when really it is not. This can cause\nserious headaches (or worse) when the traffic jams up websites or\napplications. Depending on the scale, the impact of a DDoS attack on a\nbusiness could be severe, resulting in the degradation of critical services,\nloss of productivity, extensive remediation costs, and reputational damage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been kind of treated as an unsolvable problem,\u201d Scholl said of this type\nof cyberattack. \u201cBut by working with networks, especially networks that have a\nlarge footprint, you can actually dive in and see where a lot of the stuff is\ncoming from.\u201d\n\nRooting out these bad-acting spoofers can seem like a relentless game of cat-\nand-mouse at times. But when Scholl plays the role of cat, the mouse gets\ncaught.\n\n## The cat-and-mouse chase\n\nThat\u2019s what happened last year when Scholl saw an increase of spoofing\nactivity from an external network that AWS directly connects to (known as a\n\u201cpeer network\u201d). Initially, Scholl could only see the surge in spoofed traffic\nwithin that network\u2014but this particular peer could not trace the traffic\u2019s\norigin.\n\nAn IP spoofing attack can have many components. But at minimum, an attack\ntypically involves: 1) a bad-acting IP spoofer, 2) a hosting provider where\nthat bad actor is able to set up shop, and 3) an upstream network where\nspoofing is able to proliferate.\n\n\u201cOne of the networks we work with was struggling to find the source of the\nspoofing, and it looked like more and more booters (on-demand DDoS attack\nservices offered by enterprising criminals) were setting up shop behind them,\u201d\nScholl said.\n\nScholl figured out that the attackers were most likely connected to the peer\nnetwork from a specific region in Canada based on where traffic was coming\nfrom. Even armed with this information, the network had trouble identifying\nwhich of its customers was originating the attack. But when Scholl dug into\nwhere people were purchasing hosts for spoofing and combined that with network\npath analysis to narrow the scope to a particular city, he triangulated the\nlikely hosting provider they were using.\n\nIt turned out that this single Canadian internet hosting company had a number\nof attacks coming from its users. Fortunately, once Scholl helped the peer\nnetwork isolate the provider servicing these bad actors, a firewall filter was\napplied, cutting off its infrastructure\u2014and the attacks stopped.\n\nAs cat-and-mouse pursuits go for Scholl, this was a relatively lengthy chase,\nlasting more than a month from start to finish. Sometimes his anti-spoofing\ncases take just minutes to crack, if peer networks are quick to respond. In\ncomplicated cases, Scholl might even map out the details of the spoofing\nsources and related networks with drawings to parse out the complex issues at\nhand.\n\n## Solving a once-impossible problem with sleuthing and diplomacy\n\nFighting cyberattacks doesn\u2019t always require this kind of high-touch approach.\nApplications built on AWS benefit from native DDoS protections, and can be\ndesigned to be extremely resilient against DDoS attacks using AWS services and\nsecurity controls.\n\nAll internet traffic that moves customers onto the AWS network is scrubbed by\nAWS Shield (a managed DDoS protection service), which automatically resolves\nmore than 99% of DDoS attacks in the system\u2014thousands on a daily basis. The\nremaining 1% are remediated by a 24/7 response team.\n\nThat\u2019s where Scholl comes in. Experts say his work at AWS has made a dent in a\ndecades-old internet safety issue that affects everyone online.\n\n\u201cDealing with IP spoofing is a community effort and many people have made a\ncontribution. Tom Scholl has done considerably more than most,\u201d said Dr.\nRichard Clayton, an academic at the University of Cambridge and founding\ndirector of the Cambridge Cybercrime Centre. \u201cFor the first time in 20 years,\nthe community has moved the needle in dealing with the spoofing problem and\nTom\u2014and AWS\u2014have been a huge part of this success.\u201d\n\nScholl sees it as his duty to wear many hats. Things can get tricky when\nhosting companies are reluctant or slow to take action when Scholl identifies\nspoofed traffic originating from their network. In these scenarios, he plays\nthe role of diplomat and coach, persuading them to do the right thing,\nsometimes offering technical solutions or connecting them with the right\nvendors to make it easier to implement a fix.\n\nThis strategy is something he started working on in 2021, more than a decade\nafter IP spoofing attacks first spiked. Scholl worked with other network\noperators who would review weekly reports on unusual traffic spikes that they\nwould then trace to the original\u2014usually fraudulent\u2014source.\n\n\u201cI was like, 'The reports are great, but they\u2019d come out weekly, and I didn\u2019t\nwant to wait until Sunday afternoon to act on it,\u2019 Scholl recalled of the\nearly days of his spoof detection work. \u201cI\u2019ve got the data now. I could just\nrun this every single day, so why wait?\u201d\n\nThat daily habit of checking reports and collaborating with other networks,\ncustomers, and partners continues to this day.\n\n## Keeping the internet safe for grumpy cats (and people) everywhere\n\nScholl\u2019s hands-on approach to threat intelligence is a novel one, and one that\nfew others dive into with such zeal. He and his team are at the tip of the\nspear of AWS\u2019s DDoS mitigation efforts, which also include detecting botnets\n(networks of computers that have been infected by malware) and tracing HTTP\nrequest floods via open proxies (a ploy attackers use to hide their true\norigin), in addition to finding the source of spoofed IP traffic.\n\nHe often works from his home office outside Seattle, with one or more of his\ncats\u2014Piggu, Izzy, Vincent, Theo, Luke\u2014as company.\n\nScholl\u2019s adjacent obsessions with both customers and cats have manifested in a\nseries of internal cat-themed names for software projects he has worked on\nduring his 13 years at Amazon, all tracked in a \u201ccat-alogue,\u201d of course.\nColleagues and family members started giving him cat T-shirts, and his work\nuniform is now selected daily from his collection of more than 100 of them.\n\nSomewhere along the way, a cat-themed \u201cMeowstanding Award\u201d was created for\nAmazon employees who demonstrate their ability to model Amazon\u2019s \u201cBe peculiar\u201d\nmantra. (Yes, Scholl is a recipient.) Years ago, he even asked Amazon\u2019s\nleaders if they would consider expanding the company\u2019s bring-your-dog-to-work\npolicies to include cats. (No, this did not happen, but Tom still laughs about\nit now.)\n\nIf you think about the large number of famous felines on the internet, and the\namount of cat-themed data that must be saved\u2014and secured\u2014in the AWS Cloud, it\nonly makes sense that Scholl would have a keen interest in protecting it all.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of cats on the internet. A lot of cat memes,\u201d Scholl said.\n\u201cThe way I see it, cats and the internet go together.\u201d\n\nScholl's efforts are just one of the ways AWS safeguards itself, its\ncustomers, and the entire internet\u2014often behind the scenes.
