But then Elon Musk\ndecided to start charging for the blue tick instead, and mayhem ensued as a\nwave of imposter accounts began jokingly posing as brands.\n\nAfter that, paying for a blue checkmark began to attract derision, as non-\npaying users passed around a meme under blue-checked posts, saying, \"This MF\npaid for Twitter.\" To help spare paid subscribers this embarrassment, X began\nallowing users to hide their blue check last August, turning \"hide your\ncheckmark\" into a feature of paid subscriptions.\n\nHowever, earlier this month, X decided that hiding a checkmark would no longer\nbe allowed, deleting the feature from its webpage detailing what comes with X\nPremium. An archive of X's page shows that the language about how to hide your\ncheckmark was removed after April 6, with X no longer promising to \"continue\nto evolve this feature to make it better for you\" but instead abruptly ending\nthe perk.\n\nX's decision to stop hiding checkmarks came after the platform began gifting\nblue checkmarks to popular accounts. Back in April 2023, then-Twitter had\nawarded blue checks to celebrity accounts with more than a million followers.\nLast week, now-X doled out even more blue checks to accounts with over 2,500\npaid verified followers. Now, accounts with more than 2,500 paid verified\nfollowers get Premium features for free, and accounts with more than 5,000\npaid verified followers get Premium+.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou might think that X giving out freebies would be well-received, but\nBusiness Insider tech reporter Katie Notopoulos, one of many accounts suddenly\ngifted the blue check, summed up how many X users were feeling about the\ngifted tick by asking, \"does it seem uncool?\"\n\nX doesn't seem to care anymore if blue checks are seen as uncool, though.\nAnyone who doesn't want the complimentary check can refuse it, and any paid\nsubscriber upset about losing the ability to hide their checkmark can always\njust stop paying for Premium features.\n\nAccording to X, anyone deciding to cancel their subscription over the loss of\nthe \"hide your checkmark\" feature can expect the check to remain on their\naccount \"until the end of the subscription term you paid for, unless your\naccount is suspended or the blue checkmark is otherwise removed by X for any\nreason.\"\n\nX could also suddenly remove a checkmark without refunding users in extreme\ncircumstances.\n\n\"X reserves the right without notice to remove your blue checkmark at any time\nin its sole discretion without offering you a refund, including if you violate\nour Terms of Service or if your account is suspended,\" X's subscription page\nwarns.\n\nX Daily, an X news account, announced that the change was coming this week,\ngathering \"meltdown reactions\" from users who are upset that their blue checks\nwill soon no longer be hidden.\n\n\"Let me hide my checkmark, I'm not a fucking bot,\" a user called @4gntt\nposted, the complaint seemingly alluding to Musk's claim that paid\nsubscriptions are the only way to stop bots from overrunning X.\n\n\"Oh no,\" another user, @jeremyphoward, posted. \"I signed up to X Premium since\nit's required for them to pay me... but now they [are] making the cringemark\nnon-optional :( Not sure if it's worth it.\"\n\nIt's currently unclear when the \"hide your checkmark\" feature will stop\nworking. Neither of those users criticizing X currently display a blue tick on\ntheir profile, suggesting that their checks are still hidden, but it's also\npossible that some users immediately stopped paying in response to the policy\nchange.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How The Callisto Protocol's Gameplay Was Perfected Months Before Release\n\n#### reader comments\n\n55\n\nAshley Belanger Ashley is a senior policy reporter for Ars Technica, dedicated\nto tracking social impacts of emerging policies and new technologies.
