It sits on top of your data lake storage\n(like cloud object stores) and provides a performant and scalable metadata\nlayer on top of data stored in the Parquet format.\n\nOrganizations use BigQuery to manage and analyze all data types, structured\nand unstructured, with fine-grained access controls. In the past year,\ncustomer use of BigQuery to process multiformat, multicloud, and multimodal\ndata using BigLake has grown over 60x. Support for open table formats gives\nyou the flexibility to use existing open source and legacy tools while getting\nthe benefits of an integrated data platform. This is enabled via BigLake \u2014 a\nstorage engine that allows you to store data in open file formats on cloud\nobject stores such as Google Cloud Storage, and run Google-Cloud-native and\nopen-source query engines on it in a secure, governed, and performant manner.\nBigLake unifies data warehouses and lakes by providing an advanced, uniform\ndata governance model.\n\nThis week at Google Cloud Next '24, we announced that this support now extends\nto the Delta Lake format, enabling you to query Delta Lake tables stored in\nCloud Storage or Amazon Web Services S3 directly from BigQuery, without having\nto export, copy, nor use manifest files to query the data.\n\n### Why is this important?\n\nIf you have existing dependencies on Delta Lake and prefer to continue\nutilizing Delta Lake, you can now leverage BigQuery native support. Google\nCloud provides an integrated and price-performant experience for Delta Lake\nworkloads, encompassing unified data management, centralized security, and\nrobust governance. Many customers already harness the capabilities of Dataproc\nor Serverless Spark to manage Delta Lake tables on Cloud Storage. Now,\nBigQuery\u2019s native Delta Lake support enables seamless delivery of data for\ndownstream applications such as business intelligence, reporting, as well as\nintegration with Vertex AI. This lets you do a number of things, including:\n\n  * Build a secure and governed lakehouse with BigLake\u2019s fine-grained security model\n\n  * Securely exchange Delta Lake data using Analytics Hub\n\n  * Run data science workloads on Delta Lake using BigQuery ML and Vertex AI\n\n## How to use Delta Lake with BigQuery\n\nDelta Lake tables follow the same table creation process as BigLake tables.\n\n### Required roles\n\nTo create a BigLake table, you need the following BigQuery identity and access\nmanagement (IAM) permissions:\n\n  * bigquery.tables.create\n\n  * bigquery.connections.delegate\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nBefore you create a BigLake table, you need to have a dataset and a Cloud\nresource connection that can access Cloud Storage.\n\n### Table creation using DDL\n\nHere is the DDL statement to create a Delta lake Table\n\n1\n\n    \n    \n    CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE `PROJECT_ID.DATASET.DELTALAKE_TABLE_NAME`\n\n2\n\n    \n    \n    WITH CONNECTION `PROJECT_ID.REGION.CONNECTION_ID`\n\n3\n\n    \n    \n    OPTIONS (\n\n4\n\n    \n    \n    format =\"DELTA_LAKE\",\n\n5\n\n    \n    \n    uris=['DELTA_TABLE_GCS_BASE_PATH']);\n\n### Querying Delta Lake tables\n\nAfter creating a Delta Lake BigLake table, you can query it using GoogleSQL\nsyntax, the same as you would a standard BigQuery table. For example:\n\n1\n\n    \n    \n    SELECT FIELD1, FIELD2 FROM `PROJECT_ID.DATASET.DELTALAKE_TABLE_NAME`\n\nYou can also enforce fine-grained security at the table level, including row-\nlevel and column-level security. For Delta Lake tables based on Cloud Storage,\nyou can also use dynamic data masking.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe believe that BigQuery\u2019s support for Delta Lake is a major step forward for\ncustomers building lakehouses using Delta Lake. This integration will make it\neasier for you to get insights from your data and make data-driven decisions.\nWe are excited to see how you use Delta Lake and BigQuery together to solve\ntheir business challenges.
