On Boethius\u2019 \u201cConsolation of Philosophy.\u201d\n\nDmitry Fadeyev\n\nApr 19, 2024\n\n1\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Evil Is Nothing\n\nwww.falltide.com\n\nShare\n\n\u201cPlease stop representing yourself as a philosopher, you affected fool!\u201d cried\nEpictetus in one of his lectures. \u201cYou still experience envy, pity, jealousy\nand fear, and hardly a day passes that you don\u2019t whine to the gods about your\nlife. Some philosopher!\u201d1 The Stoic sage is talking about scholars who know a\ngreat deal of theory but apply nothing in practice, who can talk for hours but\nare completely powerless in the face of adversity.\n\nWhen, sometime in AD 523, the Roman philosopher Anicius Boethius was\nimprisoned and sentenced to death (including a bout of gruesome torture), the\nquestion of the value of his learning was put to him in no uncertain terms.\nHaving lost his considerable power and wealth, he found himself in the\nposition of those so-called philosophers Epictetus was criticizing. As he sat\nin prison awaiting execution, he began writing, structuring his thoughts as a\nconversation between himself and Philosophy, who materializes in his room to\nhelp him confront his predicament. The result is the most widely read\nphilosophical work of the Middle Ages: On the Consolation of Philosophy.\n\n\u201cThis, then, is how you reward your followers,\u201d2 Boethius complains bitterly\nto Philosophy. He followed her guidance by spoking the truth, only to find\nhimself punished like a criminal, with suffering and death as his reward. And\nthe real criminals? They are the ones doing the sentencing, the ones left to\nenjoy their plunder. How could this in any way be just, and how could he be\nexpected to do anything other than despair at his unhappy fate?\n\nBoethius\u2019 Philosophy begins by explaining that the things he is distressed\nabout losing are not only worthless, but never even belonged to him in the\nfirst place. She does this by painting a picture of Fortune and her wheel, the\nRota Fortunae, upon which she keeps spinning human fates. On one side of the\nwheel are those moving up in life, on the other going down. Some get a lucky\nbreak and are propelled on their way to wealth, power and fame. Others suffer\nmisfortunes and lose everything they\u2019ve gained. The point is that Fortune is\nalways spinning her wheel, and those who are enjoying prosperity now are\ncertain to experience setbacks or even disasters in the future. \u201cChange is her\nnormal behavior, her true nature. In the very act of changing she has\npreserved her own particular kind of constancy towards you.\u201d Building your\nhappiness upon the things that don\u2019t really belong to you but to Fortune, and\nwhich she is going to take away tomorrow, is a sure path to misery.\n\nIllustration from a 15th century French manuscript of the Consolation of\nPhilosophy (source). On the left is Philosophy conversing with Boethius, on\nthe right is Fortune spinning her wheel.\n\nMoreover, getting more from Fortune isn\u2019t even a good thing. For example, the\nwealthier you become, the more anxiety you will feel about losing it all. \u201cHow\nsplendid, then, the blessing of mortal riches is! Once won, they never leave\nyou carefree again,\u201d mocks Philosophy. Power is no better, for not only does\nyour position grow more dangerous the higher you rise, but the people who try\nto befriend you do so for their own selfish ends, ready to betray you the\nmoment Fortune turns against you. Even kings have the sword of Damocles\nhanging over their heads\u2014especially kings. \u201cWhat sort of power is it, then,\nthat strikes fear into those who possess it, confers no safety on you if you\nwant it, and which cannot be avoided when you want to renounce it?\u201d Fame, even\nif it is deserved, doesn\u2019t last, and the pursuit of bodily pleasure, taken\nbeyond moderation, results in illness and pain.\n\nAnd yet, we cannot say that wealth, power, fame and pleasure are bad and\nundesirable. There is something about each of them that is clearly good. It is\ngood to be self-sufficient, good to be strong, good to be honored and\nrespected, and good to be joyful. Those who pursue these things are therefore\nnot wholly wrong. The problem, explains Boethius\u2019 Philosophy, lies in\ndivision. What people typically do is pursue one of these goods at the expense\nof the others. This makes them unhappy because they are always lacking\nsomething in their lives:\n\n> If a man pursues wealth by trying to avoid poverty, he is not working to get\n> power; he prefers being unknown and unrecognized, and even denies himself\n> many natural pleasures to avoid losing the money he has got. But certainly\n> no sufficiency is achieved this way, since he is lacking in power and vexed\n> by trouble; he is of no account because of his low esteem, and is buried in\n> obscurity. And if a man pursues only power, he expends wealth, despises\n> pleasures and honor without power, and holds glory of no account. But you\n> can see how much this man also lacks; at any one time he lacks the\n> necessaries of life and is consumed by worry, from which he cannot free\n> himself, so he ceases to be what he most of all wants to be, that is,\n> powerful. A similar argument can be applied to honor, glory, and pleasures,\n> for, since any one of them is the same as the others, a man who pursues one\n> of them to the exclusion of the others cannot even acquire the one he wants.\n\nBoethius\u2019 Philosophy explains that if you want to be happy, you must pursue\nall facets of happiness at once, or rather, you must pursue that which is the\nsource of all the goods and therefore the source of perfect happiness. Because\nthe unity of all the goods is the highest good the human mind can conceive,\nBoethius identifies it with God. To pursue God means to pursue perfect\ngoodness, i.e. to pursue all the things that constitute the good life\nsimultaneously: self-sufficiency, strength, honor, glory and joy. Put another\nway, the path to happiness is virtue.\n\nBoethius essentially makes the same conclusion as the Stoics, although he\narrives there via a different route. The Stoic argument is, briefly, as\nfollows: there are things that are under our control (our impressions and\nwill), and others outside our control (all externals). Focusing on things\noutside of our control makes us unhappy because even though we can influence\nthem, we cannot guarantee their results. Even if you do everything right,\nevents wholly outside of your power\u2014wars, natural disasters, diseases\u2014can\nprevent you from achieving your goals. So rather than focusing on outcomes,\nfocus instead on how you deal with whatever Fortune throws your way, both good\nand bad. The Stoics don\u2019t assign value to outside events\u2014nothing external is\ngood or bad, it\u2019s all indifferent. What is good or bad is how you act. Do you\ngive in to base instincts like fear, anger, impatience and greed, or do you\nbehave courageously in the face of misfortune, and with self-restraint when\nthings go your way? A good life is a virtuous life, not a fortunate one.\n\nBoethius\u2019 imprisonment is therefore not a misfortune at all but an occasion to\nshow his virtue. \u201cA wise man ought no more to take it ill when he clashes with\nfortune than a brave man ought to be upset by the sound of battle,\u201d writes\nBoethius. \u201cFor both of them their very distress is an opportunity, for one to\ngain glory and the other to strengthen his wisdom.\u201d In fact, there would be no\nsuch thing as virtue if there was no adversity to overcome. Moreover, we\nwouldn\u2019t even know Boethius\u2019 name today had his life been spared.\n\nFor Epictetus, this perspective meant ultimate freedom. Because everything\nthat happens to you is an opportunity to build and display virtue\u2014the four\nStoic virtues being courage, temperance, justice and wisdom\u2014nothing can stop\nyou from living the good life, no matter how short or long it may be. Your\nactions always achieve their ends because the ends lie in the actions\nthemselves, not in external goals. And, unlike the worldly goods of wealth,\npower and fame, nothing can take your goodness away from you.\n\nEpictetus goes as far as to define a Stoic \u201csimply as someone set on becoming\na god rather than a man.\u201d Boethius actually makes the same assertion, saying\nthat the \u201creward of the good ... a reward that can never be decreased, that no\none\u2019s power can diminish, and no one\u2019s wickedness darken, is to become gods.\u201d\nBoethius explains it in terms of possessing goodness and happiness, both of\nwhich he identifies with divinity. For Boethius, those who lead good lives are\nhappier, and consequently more divine. \u201cWhile only God is so by nature, as\nmany as you like may become so by participation.\u201d\n\nBut the reverse isn\u2019t true\u2014that is, evil men don\u2019t become devils. Evil men\nforfeit their very existence, they cease being human. Boethius arrives at this\nconclusion by following his solution to the problem of evil. If an omnipotent\nGod can do everything, then he can also do evil, but if he can do evil, how\ncan he remain perfectly good? The answer is that Boethius\u2019 omnipotent God\ncannot do evil. Why not? Because \u201cevil is nothing.\u201d\n\nThis is quite an assertion, but it\u2019s not a new one. Writing over a hundred\nyears earlier, Augustine explained it in his Confessions in terms of\ncorruption. If we imagine a scale from something that is supremely good, which\nis therefore incorruptible, and wholly corrupted, which therefore has nothing\nleft to corrupt, then corruption\u2014that is, evil\u2014is not a substance, but a\ndeprivation of the good. Though not the same, this position is also not a\nradical departure from the Stoics, who don\u2019t assign value judgements to the\nexternal world. Nothing in the world is good or bad, it just is. For the\nStoics, the idea of good and evil applies solely to our actions (and even\nthere, evil is seen more as a defect\u2014a moral blindness). Because being\nimprisoned, stripped of his wealth and sentenced to death does not diminish\nBoethius\u2019 goodness, it therefore does him no harm.\n\nMiniatures of Boethius teaching and in prison from a 1385 Italian manuscript\n(source).\n\nBoethius views people\u2019s actions from the perspective of their relationship to\nGod, which he identifies with supreme goodness\u2014the \u201ccommon goal of all things\nthat exist.\u201d From that perspective, bad actions are not really evil, they are\nfutile, that is, they completely miss their mark. An evil man cannot harm\nothers because he cannot take away their goodness, he can only harm himself by\ndiminishing his own. \u201cEvil is not so much an infliction as a deep set\ninfection.\u201d\n\nAlthough Boethius does not use the following analogy, I think the concept of\norder and chaos also works to explain his interpretation of evil. If we\nimagine that everything is part of a divine order (\u201call that exists is in a\nstate of unity and ... goodness itself is unity\u201d), then everything that\ndetaches itself from this order disintegrates into chaos (\u201ceverything which\nturns away from goodness ceases to exist\u201d). The material remains, but any\nhigher forms composed of that material perish. By committing evil deeds,\npeople harm themselves by disintegrating that which makes them human: their\ngoodness. They don\u2019t disappear, but they debase themselves to the level of\nanimals:\n\n> You could say that someone who robs with violence and burns with greed is\n> like a wolf. A wild and restless man who is for ever exercising his tongue\n> in lawsuits could be compared to a dog yapping. A man whose habit is to lie\n> hidden in an ambush and steal by trapping people would be likened to a fox.\n> A man of quick temper has only to roar to gain the reputation of a lion-\n> heart. The timid coward who is terrified when there is nothing to fear is\n> thought to be like the hind. The man who is lazy, dull and stupid, lives an\n> ass\u2019s life. A man of whimsy and fickleness who is for ever changing his\n> interests is just like a bird. And a man wallowing in foul and impure lusts\n> is occupied by the filthy pleasures of a sow. So what happens is that when a\n> man abandons goodness and ceases to be human, being unable to rise to a\n> divine condition, he sinks to the level of being an animal.\n\nNear the end of his Consolation, Boethius uses an image similar to the wheel\nof Fortune to illustrate the relationship between God\u2019s plan (Providence) and\nits realization in the world (Fate). Imagine a series of revolving, concentric\ncircles. As you move further away from the center, a point on a circle travels\never greater distances as it spins around. As you move closer to the center,\nthe distances decrease. The point at the very axis doesn\u2019t move at all\u2014it is\nProvidence.3 Thus, \u201cwhatever moves any distance from the primary intelligence\nbecomes enmeshed in ever stronger chains of Fate, and everything is the freer\nfrom Fate the closer it seeks the center of things. And if it cleaves to the\nsteadfast mind of God it is free from movement and so escapes the necessity\nimposed by Fate.\u201d4\n\nThe human being is like vessel filled with a part of the divine, with\ngoodness, which he can choose to increase by pursuing the good life, moving\naway from the maelstrom of fate towards the still point in the center\u2014himself\nbecoming divine \u201cby participation\u201d\u2014or diminish by acting otherwise and \u201ccease\nto be at all,\u201d letting his body be whirled round by fate. On the one extreme,\nthe vessel ultimately discards its shell and becomes its contents, on the\nother, it empties its contents and becomes its shell. Boethius chose the\nformer and, despite the destruction of his vessel, his soul lived on in the\nform a thread woven into the fabric of civilization. His oppressors chose the\nlatter and were erased from collective consciousness.\n\n1\n\nDiscourses by Epictetus, Robert Dobbin translation (Penguin, 2008). The Stoics\nincluded pity in the list of negative emotions, which makes sense from the\nperspective of things that make you abandon reason. This doesn\u2019t imply a lack\nof compassion. In other places, for example, Epictetus tells his students to\nbe compassionate to others, in particular those who suffer as a result of not\nknowing how to lead good lives.\n\n2\n\nAll quotes by Boethius are from the Victor Watts translation of the\nConsolation of Philosophy (Penguin, 1999).\n\n3\n\nAs I mentioned in my post on thinking, medieval mystics used the Latin term\nnunc stans\u2014the \u201cstanding now\u201d\u2014to describe eternity as an attribute of God. The\nstillness of meditation could be seen as a kind of bridge to eternity.\n\n4\n\nThis is strikingly similar to what is written in the ancient Hindu scripture,\nThe Bhagavad Gita: \u201cThe spirit of man when in nature feels the ever-changing\nconditions of of nature. When he binds himself to things ever-changing, a good\nor evil fate whirls him round through life-in-death. But the Spirit Supreme in\nman is beyond fate ... He who knows in truth this Spirit and knows nature with\nits changing conditions, wherever this man may be he is no more whirled round\nby fate.\u201d (Chapter 13, Juan Mascar\u00f3 translation).\n\n### Subscribe to Falltide\n\nBy Dmitry Fadeyev\n\nWeekly thoughts, essays and reviews exploring timeless ideas and principles\nfrom history\u2019s greatest thinkers and doers.\n\n1\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Evil Is Nothing\n\nwww.falltide.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nThought Examinations, Indoctrination Meetings and Struggle Sessions\n\nOn the mechanics of totalitarian terror in Mao's China.\n\nApr 17, 2023 \u2022\n\nDmitry Fadeyev\n\n3\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Thought Examinations, Indoctrination Meetings and Struggle Sessions\n\nwww.falltide.com\n\nFriction, or, Why AI Will Not Replace White-Collar Jobs\n\nThinking about AI adoption through the lens of Clausewitz\u2019s concept of\nfriction.\n\nMar 23, 2023 \u2022\n\nDmitry Fadeyev\n\n4\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Friction, or, Why AI Will Not Replace White-Collar Jobs\n\nwww.falltide.com\n\nWhy Julius Caesar Didn\u2019t Burn His Boats\n\nJulius Caesar is sometimes incorrectly said to have burned his boats upon\nlanding in Britain.
