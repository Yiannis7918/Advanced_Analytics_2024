Brog has at\n> his disposal an arsenal of primitive weaponry ranging from Bone Bombs to\n> Chinese Bottle Rockets and Heat Seeking Homing Pigeons.\n>\n> In addition to single-player racing where one player races against the\n> computer, there are also several different multi-player modes including Tag,\n> Capture the Flag, and Survival. Up to four players can play on a single\n> computer in split-screen mode.\n\nCMR was released in 2000 by Pangea Software as a Mac exclusive, and it was a\npack-in game on Macs that came out around that time.\n\n## About this port\n\nThis is a port of the original OS 9 version of the game. It aims to provide\nthe best way to experience CMR on today\u2019s computers. It is an \u201cenhanced\u201d\nversion insofar as it fixes bugs that may hinder the experience, and it brings\nin a few new features in keeping with the spirit of the original game.\n\nSome of the new features include:\n\n  * Up to 4 players in split-screen multiplayer (up from 2 in the original).\n  * The UI is subtly animated and has been tweaked to be pleasant to look at on modern widescreens.\n  * Enable a timer in race modes to hone your racing skills, and keep track of your records in the all-new scoreboard!\n\nI haven\u2019t had time to restore NetSprockets multiplayer from the OS 9 version\nyet, but that may come in a later release.\n\n### More documentation\n\n  * BUILD \u2013 How to build the game from source\n  * CHANGELOG \u2013 Cro-Mag Rally version history\n  * LICENSE \u2013 Licensing info (see also below)\n  * SECRETS \u2013 Cheat codes!\n\n### Legal info\n\nCro-Mag Rally \u00a9 2000 Pangea Software, Inc.
