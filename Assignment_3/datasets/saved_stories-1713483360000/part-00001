And as more sectors become platformized, there\nis an increasing urgency to understand how these jobs have changed, what new\nwork conditions have been created, and what regulatory reforms might be needed\nto ensure fair conditions.\n\nEdited by Murali Shanmugavelan and Aiha Nguyen, The Formalization of Social\nPrecarities explores platformization from the point of view of precarious gig\nworkers in the Majority World. In countries like Bangladesh, Brazil, and India\n\u2014 which reinforce social hierarchies via gender, race, and caste \u2014 precarious\nworkers are often the most marginalized members of society. Labor platforms\nmade familiar promises to workers in these countries: work would be\ndemocratized, and people would have the opportunity to be their own boss. Yet\neven as platforms have upended the legal relationship between worker and\nemployer, they have leaned into social structures to keep workers precarious \u2014\nand in fact formalized those social precarities through surveillance and data\ncollection.\n\nAmbika Tandon and Aayush Rathi, in their contribution \u201cIndia,\u201d illustrate how\nthe convergence of platform labor and platform urbanism has resulted in hyper-\nsurveilled and controlled sites of employment that affect the most\nmarginalized workforce. In \u201cBrazil,\u201d Ludmilla Costhek Ab\u00edlio traces how\nmotorcycle couriers have had their work completely reconfigured, illustrating\nhow platformization aligns with the structural characteristics of Brazilian\nsociety. In their essay \u201cBangladesh,\u201d Ananya Raihan, Samiha Akhter, Shamarukh\nAlam, and Jinat Jahan Khan argue that platforms could reduce the precarities\nof women domestic workers by formalizing the scope of work and establishing\nbasic workplace treatment standards, but choose not to do so.\n\nIn illuminating the double-edged sword of platformization, this anthology\nunderscores the need for regulators and advocates to acknowledge how platforms\nboth control workers and reinforce social hierarchies.\n\nThis report was produced with support from the W.K.
