(Yup! All running in the\nbrowser \u2728)\n\nUsing FastAPI allows us to create examples that demonstrate how to change the\nstatus code (like this one) and how to add headers (like this one).\n\nIt also displays the errors field if something goes wrong (as in this\nexample), which has been a longstanding issue for a while \ud83d\ude0a\n\nI have some ideas on improving the Playground, but if you have anything in\nmind, just let me know. I would also love to make a generic version of it so\nit can be reused by other Python libraries (interested? Let me know!)\n\nI also want to take this opportunity to thank our sponsors \ud83d\udc47\n\nThanks to our sponsor\n\n\ud83d\udc4b Thanks for reading, and if you're curious, go try it here: Strawberry\nPlayground\n\n## Subscribe to Strawberry GraphQL\n\nA Python library for creating GraphQL APIs\n\nSubscribe\n\n", "frontpage": false}
