The full\noriginal/unedited essay is below the fold.\n\nIn hindsight the thing I was most wrong about was this statement about\nRegulatory Problems:\n\n\u201cThis is a low probability, high impact way things could go wrong\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019ve been following fintech over the last 18 months it\u2019s clear that\nregulatory problems are much higher probability as a meaningful number of the\nbanks that underwrite fintech programs in the United States have since been\nhit with a number of consent orders. Examples include:\n\n  1. Sutton bank\n\n  2. Piermont Bank\n\n  3. Lineage Bank\n\n  4. Choice Financial\n\n  5. Cross River Bank\n\nGiven what\u2019s played out, if you\u2019re a financial technology company launching a\nprogram with a new bank, or you\u2019re not a financial services company but you\u2019re\nlaunching a financial product, you not only have to be far more diligent than\nbefore when picking a banking partner (in full disclosure, I\u2019m on the board\nof, and obviously a giant fan of Lead Bank), you also have to be far more\ndisciplined running your program.\n\n\u2013\n\n#\n\nCommon problems with bank partners\n\nAugust 2021\n\nIf you\u2019re issuing cards or building a neobank, a subtle but important choice\nto make is who you partner with as an issuing bank.[1] The bank is a critical\npart of the banking as a service ecosystem. Roughly speaking, you as the\nneobank play the marketing and customer facing role, the banking-as-a-service\npartner you work with plays the technical infrastructure (and usually ledger)\nrole, and the bank plays the regulatory and compliance role. In this role,\nthey are the repository for several crucial relationships that rarely matter\nuntil they really matter, and when they really matter, they are all that\nmatters. These roles include\n\n  * The regulatory interface: most banks you\u2019ll interact with will be regulated by the FDIC. Whenever something happens and the FDIC needs to talk to someone, they\u2019ll most likely talk to the bank and not you.\n\n  * The regulated entity: most banks you\u2019ll work with will be Durbin exempt and as a result be able to rely on relatively high interchange for consumer debit (if your business is consumer focused and dependent on card interchange as revenue, this will be key).\n\n  * The compliance entity: the bank\u2019s charter is on the hook if a card issuer breaks the rules (like not resolving disputes on time, money laundering, or holding people\u2019s money) so most banks will maintain some control over how card programs comply with the various rules.\n\n  * The network interface: the bank is typically the entity with a contractual relationship with a network like Visa, Mastercard or others\n\nAll these things simply mean, if you\u2019re issuing cards, you can\u2019t avoid working\nwith a bank in some way, shape or form. In some cases, you can outsource\nworking directly with a bank by allowing your issuer processor handle \u201cprogram\nmanagement\u201d responsibilities (and by extension outsourcing all your\ninteractions with the bank), but ultimately if you\u2019re issuing cards or\naccounts, there\u2019s going to be a bank in your stack. But which bank you work\nwith can materially impact you. In short, a good choice allows you to focus on\nbuilding a great customer experience and running your business well. A bad\nchoice forces you to focus on the bank relationship. While building the Cash\nCard I had the \u201cluck\u201d to work on 6 bank partnerships and 5 card issuing\nintegrations over 3 years. This meant seeing many ways things could go wrong.\n\n##\n\nRegulatory Problems\n\nThis is a low probability, high impact way things could go wrong. The bank is\nresponsible to the regulators for making sure customers are protected. This\nincludes everything from\n\n  * ensuring there are no lies in marketing materials, (and you don't inadvertently or intentionally violate UDAAP)[2]\n\n  * promptly responding when a customer disputes a transaction\n\n  * making cardholders whole for fraudulent transactions\n\n  * transparently disclosing fees that cardholders might face\n\n  * adequately identifying cardholders and preventing money laundering\n\n  * ensuring that the card program adheres to regulations\n\n  * and much more\n\nRegulators have an incredible range of remedies when they think a bank is\nmisbehaving, including literally stopping the bank from creating new accounts,\nsetting up new card programs, restricting / banning marketing, putting a bank\nunder a \u201cconsent order\u201d which is a way of severely limiting the business(es)\nthat a bank can operate within, all the way to (in rare cases) revoking the\nbanks charter entirely, or (more commonly) seizing the bank, and handing over\nit\u2019s management and customers to another entity. From the regulator's\nperspective, any cards underwritten by the bank are the banks responsibility.\nSo as a neobank issuing cards or accounts, or enabling money movement - when\nyou make a regulatory mistake, the thing you\u2019re ultimately putting at risk is\nthe bank\u2019s regulatory standing.\n\n##\n\nNetwork problems\n\nThis is another low probability, high impact way things could go wrong. The\nnetwork (eg MasterCard or Visa) also cares that you as the program, and the\nbank underwriting you are doing the right things in terms of identifying\ncustomers, preventing money laundering and more. In addition to ensuring you\nwon\u2019t create regulatory problems, card networks, as mediators between card\nissuers and ultimately merchants, also care deeply that your program is set up\ncorrectly, that you\u2019re not doing weird hacks to artificially inflate your\ninterchange and are dutifully following network rules. Several types of\ninterchange hacks exist, for instance,\n\n  * decoupled debit; using a balance in bank 1, typically durbin regulated, to fund card transactions in bank 2, typically unregulated (thus earning higher interchange on transactions than bank 1 is eligible for)\n\n  * authorized user; issuing cards on a commercial debit bin for a use case that is truly consumer focused\n\n  * charge card: issuing a credit or charge card but not actually extending credit in a meaningful way (eg autopay in a week)\n\n  * regional arbitrage: issuing a card from a region with high interchange (eg the US) to cardholders who actually reside and primarily operate in a low interchange region (eg Europe)\n\nNetworks, because they've been around for a while, and have seen all types of\nbehavior, are generally fairly sophisticated about these interchange hacks and\nwill often pressure the neobank, the bank, the program manager (whoever plays\nthat role) or the baas provider to reduce the odds that these things happen.\n\nNetworks are also highly sensitive about the ways their brands are used[3].\nThere\u2019s a lot to unpack here, but the cliff notes: Visa and MasterCard are\nsome of the most well known, widespread brands in the world. They invest\nhugely in their brands and care deeply about how those brands are used. This\nmeans you\u2019ll need to be extremely thoughtful about everything from your card\nart, your site, your app, and your usage of the network brand logo on all your\nonline and offline marketing materials.\n\nCard networks, over the decades, have developed a ton of levers to ensure\npartners comply. These include everything from\n\n  * Technical levers: they can simply make your cards stop working (as in stop processing transactions). As the card network, they\u2019re literally in the loop for every single card transaction. This is why, the one or two times a year when a card network has an outage, it *sucks* for everyone on that card network.\n\n  * Economic levers: they pay you interchange, and they can just . . . stop paying. The card network contracts are also typically designed with a variety of commercial incentives baked in, which are (by design) paid at the end of a period (month/quarter/year) based on performance during that period. Very often, as you scale, these incentives become sufficiently material that you\u2019ll bake them into your earnings projections. To get you to comply, the card network can simply refuse to pay these incentives (typically called rebates) until you comply, thus putting your earnings at risk. Your CFO or your Finance team estimating accruals won\u2019t like this.\n\n  * Operational levers: physical card designs are approved at the level of a batch of cards (rather than at the level of a program) so if the card network wants you to comply, they can just deny a batch. What this means is:\n\n    * Growing card programs typically order physical cards to be manufactured in batches (depending how fast you\u2019re growing, this would range from thousands to hundreds of thousands of literal cards per batch)\n\n    * Each batch is approved by a team at your card network. Typically they just ensure the design meets the specifications, the network brand is represented correctly, there\u2019s nothing offensive on the design, etc\n\n    * If there are any issues with the design, they\u2019ll engage with the issuer, program manager, or the bank to rectify the issues before approving the cards to be manufactured. The card manufacturer will not produce a batch without the card network approval, so, if they run out of card stock before a new batch is approved, you won\u2019t be able to ship any new cards to customers. For fast growing programs, this is a death knell, and an insanely effective way to guarantee good behavior\n\nThere are many others - these are just the ones I\u2019ve seen deployed. Depending\non the severity of the problem, these levers can be applied in combination\nwith one another to achieve the desired result (aka compliant behavior.) A\ngood bank partner can help you navigate these problems, and great bank\npartners will design the partnership to reduce the odds that you stumble into\none of these traps, because (depending on the relationship) often when these\nlevers are pulled, they apply to the bank as well. As your program gets\nbigger, you\u2019ll likely bypass the bank partner entirely and deal directly with\nthe network(s).\n\n##\n\nOperational Problems\n\nYour bank partner is typically closest to the metal operationally on every\npart of your program. This means that most intermediaries or counterparties\nwill pick up the phone if your bank calls, and many will literally not respond\nto you (try getting a routing number for yourself as a non-bank and see how\nthat works out for you). As a consequence of this, there\u2019s lots of little\nthings at the lowest level of offering financial services that you typically\ndon\u2019t see, but if they go wrong, your bank partner really matters. These range\nfrom:\n\n  * Batch Processes: Many banks rely on batch SFTP system to process ACH transactions. The number of batches a day affect when your ACH transactions are initiated or received. This can be the difference between an ACH transaction completing on Friday or the following Monday (which will deeply matter to your cardholders). In addition many banks have built human based workflows around these processes, so making changes to them require a human component, in addition to technical ones. I once saw a program go a whole day without any ACH transactions processed, only to discover the next day that the person responsible for ACH at the bank had taken a personal day. No backup person existed and no one thought about this single point of failure risk, so thousands of customers waited an extra day to get their paychecks deposited. This is unfortunately typical and something to keep an eye on.\n\n  * Exceptions: when things go wrong with a transaction, you\u2019re often reliant on the bank to investigate the transaction and figure out what happened, how to fix it and how to prevent it. However, your customer only knows and cares about your role. As a result, you\u2019re dependent on a bank process and the responsiveness of their people, which you don\u2019t control, to fix a customer problem, for which you\u2019re responsible. Fun times.\n\n  * Reconciliation: if you manage your own ledger, you\u2019ll need reconciliation to ensure that your view of what money has moved and how, matches the external world\u2019s view. To properly reconcile card transactions, you\u2019ll often need direct access to the settlement files (where the card networks include final transaction amounts including tips, etc). These aren\u2019t error proof. Handling interruptions in these, and good discipline investigating errors are hallmarks of operational excellence. (I think more recently, with the flourishing of BAAS providers, some have turned this part of the process into a webhook based process rather than a file based process, which I fully support).\n\n  * Float & Credit: as a card issuer you\u2019ll need to have funds available to settle, and typically, even for a program with a \u201cgood funds\u201d model, you\u2019ll have cases where funds should be available for a customer to spend, before the funds actually arrive in the customer\u2019s bank account or balance. The average bank partner will require you to put up enough funds - measured from weeks at the start to days when you\u2019ve scaled - so you always have money available when the networks come to settle. A good bank partner will figure out an underwriting model that allows you to scale without tying up tons of equity capital as working capital. This is something that you ask about, monitor and optimize downwards as you scale so your Treasury can ensure maximum, low/no risk investing return efficiency for the dormant tranche of your customer\u2019s cash.\n\n  * Risk tolerance for emergent use cases: one concept that every startup benefits from is emergent use cases - customers using your product in a way that you didn't originally intend, hacking it to solve some problem that wasn't apparent or clear to you (or to anyone else in market) when you started out. This is the lifeblood of a new product - you're capturing latent demand, and you now have an insight no one else does. Banks absolutely hate emergent use cases, because their risk systems rely on historical patterns that have proven safe, and an emergent use case is a new pattern, that by definition doesn't show up in the history. An example of this could be a sorority pooling funds for a group purchase, but doing it on a single player debit card. Several of the sorority members have access to the account. To the bank, this can look like several, different mobile devices logged into to a user account, which traditionally would be suspicious. Issuers that started out with branches often have literally no way for more than one person to be logged into an account, or more than one linked email address, phone number etc. To the neobank, this looks like additional spend that no competitor or incumbent has as yet captured, and a user behavior to build products around. As the ultimately regulated entity, the bank can (and will) close accounts they find suspicious, without and the sorority will now have a bad experience where their money is locked or their card is cancelled, and ultimately don't care who caused it, and thus will blame you.\n\n###\n\nDiligence\n\nThe way the ecosystem is set up today, it's pretty much impossible to tell the\ndifferences between different potential banking partners. There\u2019s no\nequivalent of yelp reviews- they\u2019re pretty opaque from the outside looking in,\nand often you will face this tension where your banking-as-a-service platform\nor issuer processor wants to completely own the relationship and shield you\nfrom dealing with the bank in anyway (there\u2019s lots of good reasons and bad\nreasons why this happens). In addition, because neobanks, processors and BAAS\nproviders are all so dependent on their bank partners, they have no incentive\nto air their dirty laundry publicly, as that would put their relationship(s)\nat risk. The result is, your options for diligence are fairly limited - you\neither have to have done it before, know someone who has, or be in one of the\nmany private slack groups that have sprung up around these topics for neobank\nstartups over the past few years. When choosing a bank partner, it helps to\ntalk to programs that are already live with that bank to understand what\nthey\u2019re like to work with, and in particular how they deal with problems:\ndisputes, exceptions, disagreements on how the program should be run, etc.\nEasiest starting point that I've seen is by using the open source list of\nbanks and processors curated by Aaron Frank[4]. If necessary, there are also\ncompliance consultants who can help you think through bank selection.\n\n##\n\nSome things are unavoidable\n\nIn the best case, you\u2019ll encounter a few of these problems. In the likely\ncase, you\u2019ll encounter a lot of them as you scale. I think the reasonable\napproach is to design your plan around dealing with these problems well,\nrather than not having them at all. For what it\u2019s worth, across the several\ndozen card issuer programs I\u2019ve encountered, not a single one has scaled\nwithout hitting one or more of the above problems with their bank partner. In\nmost cases, the problems start before the programs have even started to scale.\nThere\u2019s a reason why every single neobank program that\u2019s scaled over the last\nhalf decade in the US has relationships with more than one bank partner.\n\nThanks to Timothy Thairu, Aaron Frank, Ryan Lea, and Jim Esposito for reading\nthis in draft form\n\n##\n\nNotes\n\n[1] This discussion is scoped to the domain where I have expertise, which is\nneobanks, challengers banks and others on the card issuing and account issuing\nside.
