The end result is that you are able to access valuable videos on youtube without being subjected to the low quality video thumbnails designed to hijack your attention and elicit an emotional response. If you were to take a road trip to a national park, would you want to see billboards on the side of the road every ten feet? Of course not! You are there for the scenery. And that is what untrap gives you with youtube. Highly reccomend everyone give it a shot.\n\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\nby Casamiir\n\n  *     * > I never do reviews for anything, so this extension really means a lot to me.
