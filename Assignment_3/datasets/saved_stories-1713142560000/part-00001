That means it can\nbe compiled into a single binary file and work on linux, darwin and windows\noperating systems. Gemfast can be quickly installed on a server without any\nother dependencies and configured using a single HashiCorp Configuration\nLanguage (HCL) file.\n\n  * Gemfast\n\n    * Why Gemfast\n    * Installing\n\n      * Debian Package\n\n        * Debian Package SSL\n      * Docker\n      * Building From Source\n    * Docs\n    * UI\n    * License\n\n## Why Gemfast\n\nGemfast was created for users who need to self-host their rubygems and want\nsomething quick to setup and easy to manage. Gemfast allows users to mirror\nand cache gems from rubygems.org as well as upload their own internally\ndeveloped gems which can't be distributed publically. It supports both the\nlegacy Dependency API and the newer Compact Index API.\n\nGemfast has the following unique benefits:\n\n  * There is no need to install/upgrade/manage a version of Ruby on the server\n  * Go is generally faster and requires less memory then Ruby (still \u2764\ufe0f Ruby though)\n  * There are no external server dependencies like postgres, redis or memcached\n  * Gemfast can allow/deny gems based on CVE severity or a regex list\n\n## Installing\n\nGemfast is currently distributed in two different ways, a .deb package and a\ndocker image.\n\nThe .deb package includes a web server which proxies HTTPS traffic to Gemfast\nand is recommended when installing Gemfast on a virtual machine or bare-metal\ninstance.\n\n### Debian Package\n\nTo install the .deb package, download it from the latest GitHub release and\ninstall it with dpkg.\n\n    \n    \n    curl -L -O gemfast_<version>_amd64.deb sudo dpkg -i ./gemfast_<version>_amd64.deb sudo systemctl start gemfast.service\n\n#### Debian Package SSL\n\nThe Gemfast .deb package includes Caddy Server which will automatically\ngenerate and manage a let's encrypt SSL certificate for your server. Caddy\noffers a few ways to generate a valid SSL certificate, see:\nhttps://caddyserver.com/docs/automatic-https#acme-challenges. If the let's\nencrypt challenge fails, the server will use a self-signed certificate.\n\n### Docker\n\nWhen running Gemfast as a container, its important to mount the following\ndirectories:\n\n  * /etc/gemfast - The directory for the gemfast.hcl config file\n  * /var/gemfast - The directory for the Gemfast data including gems and database\n\n    \n    \n    docker run -d --name gemfast-server \\ -p 2020:2020 \\ -v /etc/gemfast:/etc/gemfast \\ -v /var/gemfast:/var/gemfast \\ ghcr.io/gemfast/server:latest\n\n### Building From Source\n\nGemfast uses Make to build binaries. To build and run a static binary:\n\n    \n    \n    make ./bin/gemfast-server\n\n## Docs\n\nYou can configure gemfast settings using the /etc/gemfast/gemfast.hcl file.\nThere are many options all of which are listed in the documentation.\n\nFor more information see: https://gemfast.io/docs/configuration/\n\n## UI\n\nGemfast includes a basic ui which is accessible from my.server.url/ui. For\nexample, running it locally you can access it at http://localhost:2020/ui.\n\nThe ui currently supports viewing and searching gems from both the private\ngems namespace and gems that have been cached from an upsteam.\n\nYou can also disable the ui in /etc/gemfast/gemfast.hcl:\n\n    \n    \n    ui_disabled = true\n\n## License\n\nGemfast is open source software licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.\n\n    \n    \n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
