He pressed enter. He wasn\u2019t\nsurprised to see his YouTube channel among the first results, but farther down\nthe page, something did surprise him. Someone had uploaded his YouTube videos\nto a platform he had never heard of called Gan Jing World.\n\n\u201cI pulled it up, and it had my homepage, my YouTube channel, and my YouTube\nchannel homepage,\u201d Button said. \u201cI was pissed.\u201d\n\nButton\u2019s experience is not unique. He is one of many YouTube creators who have\nstumbled across their own videos on Gan Jing World. According to the \u201cabout\nus\u201d page, Gan Jing World is a \u201cwholesome digital town square\u201d founded by\nfollowers of Falun Gong, a spiritual movement outlawed by the Chinese\ngovernment in the late 1990s. It is one of many sites linked to the right-wing\nnews organization the Epoch Times.\n\nGan Jing World (which translates to \u201cClean World\u201d in Chinese) consists of\nfeel-good videos, often lifted from YouTube without the original content\ncreator\u2019s consent. The videos supposedly follow the site\u2019s four guiding\nprinciples of \u201cno violence, no pornography, no crime, and no drugs.\u201d Button\u2019s\nYouTube channel, which features stone-carving tutorials, likely secured a spot\non Gan Jing World because it met these criteria.\n\nSandwiched between videos republished from YouTube are ads and channels for\nFalun Gong\u2013aligned organizations and local businesses. These include the\nubiquitous dance troupe Shen Yun as well as the anti-CCP media groups the\nEpoch Times and New Tang Dynasty Television (NTD)\u2014both of which are owned by\nthe Epoch Times Media Group. Together, these sites make up a tight-knit\nnetwork echoing the teachings of Falun Gong\u2019s leader and founder, Li Hongzhi\n(or \u201cMaster Li\u201d).\n\nThe Epoch Times has a tangled history going back to the early 2000s. Initially\nlaunched as a free propaganda newsletter to oppose the Chinese Communist\nParty, it transitioned into a far-right media powerhouse during the 2016\nelection. Today, the newspaper is published in more than thirty countries and\nhas a dedicated following of anti-vaxxers and hard-right-wingers, according to\na report by OpenDemocracy. Now media owned by Epoch Times Media Group and\nother Falun Gong\u2013affiliated organizations have secured a front-page and\npromotional presence on Gan Jing World.\n\nGan Jing World\u2019s landing page, featuring an ad for NTD\u2014a Falun Gong\u2013aligned\ntelevision station owned by the Epoch Times Media Group.\n\nFalun Gong in the US\n\nFalun Gong, sometimes called Falun Dafa, consists of a mix of slow-motion\nmeditation exercises, mental disciplines, and texts that preach the virtues of\ntruth, benevolence, and forbearance. Practitioners are told they can gain\nenlightenment by reading the scriptures of Li, who claims to be able to walk\nthrough walls and to levitate. His teachings include frequent pronouncements\nagainst homosexuality, interracial relationships, sex out of wedlock, and\nfemale liberation (many of these views are rejected by Falun Gong\u2019s official\nwebsite).\n\nFalun Gong flourished between 1992 and 1999 in China, claiming around seventy\nto a hundred million adherents (scholars estimate the number was lower, closer\nto ten million). The movement\u2019s pulling power intimidated the CCP, which\nsought undivided loyalty from its people. China\u2019s then-president, Jiang Zemin,\nvowed to eradicate the movement. The government declared it an \u201cevil cult\u201d and\nsuppressed it, resulting in the incarceration of thousands of practitioners in\n\u201creeducation through labor\u201d camps. Li\u2019s teachings state that practitioners\nmust now dedicate themselves to clarifying the \u201ctruth\u201d to the public that\nFalun Gong is not an evil cult and is being systematically persecuted by the\nCCP. After Li and the Falun Gong organizations were exiled to the US twenty-\nfive years ago, they set up a range of media outlets to convey this message.\n\nNTD and the Epoch Times, which Li has referred to as \u201cour media,\u201d have become\na success story for Falun Gong. The Epoch Times claims to be the US\u2019s fourth-\nlargest newspaper by subscriber count, and NTD has a staggering thirty million\nfollowers on Facebook. The Epoch Times, however, rejects the notion that it\u2019s\nofficially affiliated with the spiritual movement. The chairman of the\nnewspaper\u2019s board has said it is \u201cnot a Falun Gong newspaper,\u201d adding that\n\u201cFalun Gong is a question of an individual\u2019s belief.\u201d\n\nStill, the newspaper keeps ties with Falun Gong\u2013aligned companies like Gan\nJing World, as evident in its business transactions. In the summer of 2021,\nthe Epoch Times bought a three-story building in Orange County, New York, for\n$1.45 million. According to public property records, the Epoch Times then sold\nit to Gan Jing World for the same price about a year later. Now the building\noperates as Gan Jing World\u2019s headquarters. It\u2019s located in a sleepy city\ncalled Middletown, conveniently located a twenty-minute drive from Dragon\nSprings, the remote compound where Li resides and Falun Gong runs its schools\nand dance company, Shen Yun.\n\nWhen Gan Jing World\u2019s headquarters officially opened, in July 2022, it was\ncelebrated with a ribbon-cutting ceremony. Influential Middletowners showed\nup, including the mayor, Joseph Destefano. \u201cThe arrival of this high-tech firm\nbrings with it a myriad of opportunities for economic advancement and job\ncreation in our city,\u201d Destefano told the Epoch Times (Destefano did not\nreturn Tow\u2019s request for comment). Indeed, according to the Albany Times\nUnion, Middletown has become a \u201chot commodity\u201d for entities related to Shen\nYun and Falun Gong. In December 2023, the paper reported that the mayor\nattended another ribbon-cutting ceremony, this time for the opening of a Shen\nYun\u2013backed department store. The store sells outerwear, activewear, books with\nFalun Dafa\u2019s teachings, and \u201cexclusive selections\u201d from Shen Yun\u2019s dance\nperformances (including men\u2019s leather bracelets with Falun Gong\u2019s teachings\nengraved).\n\nGan Jing World\u2019s headquarters is located in Middletown, New York, twenty\nminutes from Dragon Springs, the remote compound where Falun Gong leader Li\nHongzhi resides.\n\nIn the fall of last year, I took a two-hour bus ride from Penn Station,\nManhattan, to visit Middletown. A few shops, a library, and a police station\nfill the ten-minute walk from the train station to Gan Jing World\u2019s\nheadquarters. The three-story brick block is easy to spot among the sparse and\nlow surrounding buildings. A water fountain in a brutalist style greeted\nemployees walking in and out of the entrance doors. One Middletown local said\nthe building used to be a decaying Social Services office. When Gan Jing World\nbought and reconstructed it, the equipment was delivered wrapped in plastic\nwith the logo of Dragon Springs. \u201cThe UPS guy got in there once,\u201d he said,\npointing to the headquarters. \u201cHe asked them what they did, and they told him\nthey were a newspaper company.\u201d This corresponds with property records,\nindicating that the Gan Jing World building used to be owned by the Epoch\nTimes.\n\nAccording to tax documents reviewed by Brandy Zadrozny at NBC, the Epoch Times\nhas increased its revenue by a staggering 685 percent in the past two years. A\nlarge part of its success comes from its aggressive advertisement for Donald\nTrump\u2019s 2020 campaign, where it pushed conservative views through sensational\nand even fabricated information. This strategy garnered criticism from fact-\ncheckers and led to Facebook eventually banning its ads over a lack of\ntransparency around political advertisements. Subsequently, according to the\nNew York Times, Epoch Media sought to protect itself from crackdowns by\nmainstream platforms by expanding its online reach. The Times investigation\nidentified connections with over a dozen sites, such as Sagebook (a Twitter-\nlike network) and YouMaker \u2013 another video platform that hosts content on the\nEpoch Times website.\n\nNick Janicki, Gan Jing World\u2019s director of media relations, denies that there\nis any corporate affiliation between Gan Jing World and the Epoch Times.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no direct relationship there other than the founders are just, you\nknow, good friends, essentially,\u201d Janicki said.\n\nGan Jing World\u2019s employees are remarkably hard to find online. The CEO,\nsupposedly a former Apple executive named James Qiu, leaves little digital\ntrace outside of Gan Jing World\u2019s website. Even Janicki does not mention the\ncompany on his LinkedIn page. Other employees I found on LinkedIn have posted\nvague job descriptions, like \u201ctech company,\u201d coupled with previous work\nexperience at the Epoch Times or NTD.\n\nThis career switching is not uncommon among Falun Gong practitioners.\nAccording to Simon van Zuylen\u2013Wood in The Atlantic: \u201cOnce inside either the\nEpoch Times or NTD, they have tended to shuffle from one to the other and from\njob to job.\u201d\n\nFalun Gong\u2019s Use of the Internet\n\nFalun Gong has been incredibly successful at utilizing the internet to spread\nLi\u2019s teachings. As Heather Kavan, a researcher and senior lecturer at Massey\nUniversity in New Zealand, phrased it in her paper about Falun Gong and the\nmedia: \u201cOf all religious adherents, Falun Gong members are perhaps the most\nmedia-savvy.\u201c Indeed, Web-based text has grown increasingly important in\nconnecting Falun Gong practitioners as they scatter across the globe,\naccording to Australian academic Benjamin Penny in his book The Religion of\nFalun Gong. Given Falun Gong\u2019s robust digital presence, Gan Jing World\nautomatically benefits from a strong referral pipeline.\n\nBy interlinking, these sites create a network that channels traffic\nreciprocally. According to SimilarWeb, in January 2024, 13 percent of Gan Jing\nWorld\u2019s referral traffic from other websites originated from SafeChat, a\nplatform promoted by Falun Gong social media influencers as an alternative to\nmainstream social networks. Approximately 15 percent came from Shen Yun\nCreations, a video platform dedicated exclusively to Shen Yun dance videos.\nThe Epoch Times ranked second as the highest-referring publisher, trailing\nonly YouTube.\n\nFalun Gong\u2019s digital presence dates back to June 2000, when Li designed one of\nFalun Gong\u2019s official websites, Minghui.org. Posts from the site indicate that\nLi actively promoted the creation of Gan Jing World among his practitioners.\nOne practitioner claimed that it\u2019s \u201ca platform that Master has for people in\nthe future.\u201d Another post emphasized that Gan Jing World is \u201cextremely\nimportant for saving people.\u201d\n\nOn a video call, I asked Janicki about the Gan Jing World employees who had\npreviously worked at the Epoch Times or NTV. He compared the relationship\nbetween Gan Jing World and other Falun Gong media to that between OpenAI and\nMicrosoft: \u201cThere\u2019s people now from OpenAI that work for Microsoft,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt tends to be people in similar industries or similar values that\ntribalize.\u201d\n\nWhether a tribe or something more, the Epoch Times has been a consistent\ncommercial machine for the video platform. In the past two years, the\nnewspaper has published over twenty promotional articles about Gan Jing World\ndressed up as news with sparkling headlines such as \u201cTech Startup Gan Jing\nWorld Poised to Shape the Future, One Community at a Time\u201d and \u201cGan Jing\nWorld: Tech Platform Offers Clean Content Free of Communism.\u201d In an article\nwritten by the Epoch Times, the newspaper\u2019s own editor in chief was quoted\nsaying Gan Jing World\u2019s focus on character and morals \u201cis something that we\nhave loved\u201d (the Epoch Times did not return Tow\u2019s request for comment). NTD,\nthe Falun Gong\u2013rooted television station, reposts the Epoch Times coverage and\nfeatures the video platform in news segments.\n\nOne of several Twitter posts by the Epoch Times featuring Gan Jing World.\n\nYouTube Videos on Gan Jing World\n\nNone of the Epoch Times articles mentions that Gan Jing World hosts\nrepublished videos from YouTube, including copyrighted ones. This includes\neverything from the work of small individual creators to large media\norganizations like MSNBC, CNN, Fox, and Forbes. Tow examined the top 130\nvideos posted on Gan Jing World\u2019s landing page on February 22 and found that\nall but nine could be traced back to YouTube. I also talked with over a dozen\nYouTubers with content on Gan Jing World who said they have not uploaded any\nof it or given Gan Jing World permission to republish it. Most of them had\nnever even heard of the platform.\n\n\u201cI had no idea and have never been contacted by Gan Jing World, which is very\nfrustrating,\u201d said Molly Doubleday, a sustainable-living content creator on\nYouTube.\n\nSam Denby, an American YouTuber with over seven million combined subscribers,\nwas also surprised to find his channel on Gan Jing World, which he described\nas a \u201cFalun Gong\u2013affiliated YouTube knockoff.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t bother removing our logo or description in their plagiarizing\nprocess,\u201d Denby said in a YouTube video on the channel Half as Interesting.\n\nFor the copyright holders, it raises the question: Who is selecting and\nrepublishing their videos to Gan Jing World?\n\n\u201cIf it is the company\u2019s employees, then the company is the one engaging in\ncopyright infringement,\u201d Daniel Castro, an expert in internet policy and vice\npresident of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, told me in\nan email. \u201cIf the company encourages third parties to upload copyright-\nprotected content, they might be guilty of inducing infringement.\u201d\n\nGan Jing World claims all its material is either open-source or that the\noriginal creators have uploaded it. In an email, Janicki told me that \u201cGan\nJing World strictly follows copyright law even though it has no affirmative\nobligations to monitor its service to search for infringement.\u201d\n\nUnder the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, video platforms are not required\nto stay on top of the copyrighted material uploaded by their users. Due to the\nmassive amount of content being uploaded every day, it would be practically\nimpossible to do so. But platforms can\u2019t have actual knowledge that the works\nare infringing nor induce their users to infringe, according to Matthew Sag, a\nlaw professor at Emory University. Platforms are also required to remove\ncopyright-infringing content to avoid liability if they receive a video-\nremoval request from the owner.\n\nGan Jing World has a video-removal form but appears to respond to requests\nselectively. Button eventually got his content removed, but several creators\nin contact with Tow were unsuccessful despite submitting removal requests or\nemailing Gan Jing World directly.\n\n\u201cWe are such a small business that even if we were losing money, chasing to\nget it back with no guarantee of success\u2014it\u2019s cyberspace!\u2014would cost us even\nmore,\u201d said Chris Pye, one of the YouTubers unable to remove his videos from\nGan Jing World.\n\nExamples of videos on Gan Jing World republished from YouTube.\n\nRepublished YouTube videos on Gan Jing World rarely have high engagement. Most\nhave just a handful of views and sparse, overly positive, bot-like comments.\nThe only channels receiving significant engagement appear to be those from the\nFalun Gong universe. For instance, some recordings of Shen Yun\u2019s dance\nperformances claim to have up to six hundred thousand views. Notably, though,\nthe hits returned by Gan Jing World actually link to the external site for\nShen Yun Creations, where users must pay $29.99 a month for full access to the\ndance videos. In a New Yorker article, Jia Tolentino pointedly described Shen\nYun as \u201cessentially, religious-political propaganda\u2014or, more generously, an\nextremely elaborate commercial for Falun Dafa\u2019s spiritual teachings and its\nplight vis-\u00e0-vis the Chinese Communist regime.\u201d\n\nFalun Gong Practitioners on Gan Jing World\n\nGan Jing World is supported by Falun Gong practitioners to spur its growth.\nAccording to Minghui.org, the official Falun Gong website, practitioners are\nencouraged to increase traffic on Gan Jing World by creating a profile,\nsubscribing to channels, liking videos, and writing positive comments. As one\npractitioner based in China wrote:\n\n\u201cThey even requested practitioners to watch a certain number of videos every\nday, claiming that it was Master\u2019s requirement, and that browsing Gan Jing\nWorld was the same as reading the Minghui website.\u201d\n\nA former employee of the German Epoch Times suggested that practitioners were\neven encouraged to pull videos from YouTube and republish them on Gan Jing\nWorld. \u201cIt did seem like they were promoting this kind of behavior while\nretaining plausible deniability and being able to say, \u2018Well, we didn\u2019t upload\nthis, some user did,\u2019\u201d said the source, who goes by the pseudonym Emmanuel\nGoldstein (if that name sounds familiar, it\u2019s from Orwell\u2019s 1984). \u201cNow they\nchanged their approach, and they want to officially get creators on there,\u201d\nGoldstein said.\n\nAmid the sea of republished YouTube videos, Gan Jing World has a pool of\noriginal creators. Mikey Chen, a Chinese-born American with over four million\nsubscribers on YouTube, is one of them. While at NTD, Chen cocreated Off the\nGreat Wall, a YouTube channel discussing Chinese culture. At Gan Jing World\u2019s\nribbon-cutting ceremony, he said Gan Jing World could compete with platforms\nlike Facebook and TikTok. Likewise, California Insider, a show hosted by\nSiyamak Khorrami with the Epoch Times Southern California, announced on\nTwitter that it would move to Gan Jing World after experiencing \u201ccensorship\u201d\non Twitter.\n\nGan Jing World is becoming a key player through which Falun Gong promotes its\nown organizations while using content from other platforms to confer an air of\nlegitimacy. Just as the Epoch Times grew from a scrappy newsletter to one of\nthe most prominent conservative papers in the US, it\u2019s not unimaginable that\nGan Jing World could experience similar growth. Regardless of its future, Gan\nJing World\u2019s claim to being a \u201cwholesome\u201d platform while employing\nquestionable ethical practices should not be ignored. According to Janicki,\nthe director of media relations, Gan Jing World is here to stay. And soon, he\nsaid, YouTube content creators may feel differently about discovering their\ncontent on the platform: \u201cThere may be a day where they\u2019re less surprised and\nmore relieved.\u201d\n\n# About the Tow Center\n\nThe Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia's Graduate School of\nJournalism, a partner of CJR, is a research center exploring the ways in which\ntechnology is changing journalism, its practice and its consumption \u2014 as we\nseek new ways to judge the reliability, standards, and credibility of\ninformation online.\n\nView other Tow articles \u00bb\n\nVisit Tow Center website \u00bb\n\nThe voice of journalism, since 1961\n\n### About\n\n  * Mission\n  * Masthead\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Contact\n\n### Support CJR\n\n  * Become a Member\n  * Donate\n\n### Advertise\n\n  * Contact Us\n\nCopyright 2024, Columbia Journalism Review\n\n", "frontpage": false}
