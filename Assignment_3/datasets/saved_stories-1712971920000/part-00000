We need to imagine\nwhat defeat looks like if we're going to snap out of it.\n\nJeffrey Gedmin\n\n09 Apr 2024, 12:58 pm\n\nA 1931 book of essays titled If It Had Happened Otherwise contains German-\nSwiss writer Emil Ludwig\u2019s chapter, \u201cIf the Emperor Frederick Had Not Had\nCancer.\u201d Ludwig has the German ruler living past 1888 and, together with his\nwife Empress Victoria, leading a liberal German empire with a British-style\ncabinet. As a consequence, there\u2019s no belligerent \u201cNew Course\u201d from son Kaiser\nWilhelm II. Wilhelm\u2019s tactless statements, the erratic foreign policy, the\nnaval build-up, the colonial expansion, and the posturing and brinkmanship\nthat helped lead to World War I\u2014all this gets deleted from history and 1914\nbecomes a year of peace.\n\nWinston Churchill investigates in the same volume what might have happened had\nthe Confederacy won the American Civil War. Churchill has an ironic twist: The\nSouth\u2019s own abolition of slavery. Along similar lines, Abraham Lincoln had\nconcluded, \u201cIf willing faithfully to cleanse this continent of slavery, and if\nthey will dwell beside us in goodwill as an independent but friendly nation,\nit would not be right to prolong the slaughter on the question of sovereignty\nalone.\u201d In Churchill\u2019s counterfactual history, the two Americas and Britain\nform the \u201cEnglish Speaking Association\u201d and prevent World War I.\n\nSwastika Night was published in 1937. British writer Katharine Burdekin,\nwriting under the pseudonym Murray Constantine, depicts a Nazi future with\nJews eradicated, a cult of masculinity gone wild, and women confined in\nconcentration camps serving reproduction purposes only. Burdekin used a\npseudonym to protect her family from fascist attacks in England.\n\nThe Man in the High Castle came later. Philip K. Dick\u2019s 1962 novel is about a\ndystopian alternate reality where victorious Germany and Japan have divided\nAmerica into two occupied territories after World War II. Japanese Pacific\nStates are in the west with San Francisco as regional capital. New York is\nGreater Nazi Reich\u2019s capital in the east. The Amazon-produced television\nseries based on the book premiered in January 2015.\n\nRussia\u2019s full-scale war on Ukraine began two winters ago with proclamations of\n\u201cGlory to Ukraine.\u201d Those blue and yellow flags were hoisted everywhere. We\nall knew that Russian revanchism had to be defeated. An end to Vladimir\nPutin\u2019s imperialist project, we said, would send the signal that America and\nits allies were prepared to defend the rules-based world order. China and Iran\nwould be chastened. Authoritarian populism would be dealt a blow. Liberal\ndemocracy across the West would rally and be revived.\n\nWhat if Ukraine loses the war? We\u2019re now getting used to the idea that yet\nanother made-in-Moscow frozen conflict may lie in store. If this is where\nwe\u2019re headed, we\u2019d profit from a wide lens and a long-term view of\npossibilities and probabilities of what\u2019s apt to follow.\n\nVladimir Putin is almost certain to use a freeze as a tactical pause to start\nbuilding back better. Russian armed forces performed miserably at the outset.\nBut then Putin fired commanders, discovered Iranian drones, survived\nsanctions, and identified a secret weapon\u2014the vast quantity of men he can\nchuck onto the battlefield. Ask Poland, the Baltic nations, and the Nordic\nstates how secure they\u2019ll feel if today\u2019s Russia, led by an indicted war\ncriminal, is allowed to sit at the table to negotiate peace through Ukrainian\npartition.\n\nIf Kyiv feels compelled to cede territory to invading, occupying forces,\nUkrainians will finish the war divided with grievance rather than united and\nrejuvenated. A friend describes a bleak scene: a village in western Ukraine\nwhere inhabitants are women, the elderly, and young men back from war without\nlimbs. Get used to the profile. Young amputees will feature in a future\nUkrainian parliament. A decent number will be bitter from sacrifice without\nvictory. The Ukrainian vision all along has been that all invading Russian\nforces must leave Ukraine.\n\nAbsent this outcome, an angry political Right will get traction, blaming the\nWest for temporizing and appeasement. We gave Ukraine just enough weapons,\nthey\u2019ll maintain, to prolong the war and settle for a draw. Growing ranks of\nradicals and neo-Nazis will go underground to fight Russian occupying forces\nin the east. Crimea will remain in Russian hands. The Black Sea will become a\nRussian lake.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene and Viktor Orb\u00e1n will say I told you so. This was never\nour war, they\u2019ll sermonize, and Russia was never to be defeated anyway.\nPointing to what they describe as those corrupt, ungrateful Ukrainians,\nauthoritarian populists will get a boost. This will include both the right-\nwing AfD (Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland) and Sahra Wagenknecht\u2019s new left-wing\nworkers\u2019 party in Germany. It will include Marine Le Pen\u2019s comparably pro-\nRussian National Rally party in France. Le Pen will have a chance at the\nFrench presidency in three years. Michel Houellebecq\u2019s last speculative novel\nDestroy actually has Le Pen stepping aside and a turn to an even harder Right\nin 2027.\n\nBy then Germany\u2019s Zeitenwende will have gone out with a whimper as Germans\nturn to a new \u201cprincipled realism.\u201d Winning would have mattered. But now\nGerman Greens and other ardent war supporters will be chastised. Berlin will\nadjust to accommodate new realities. Russia is still a nuclear power with\nnational interests that are hardly illegitimate, it will be said. America\ncan\u2019t make up its mind about its place in the world; it\u2019s either turning\ninward or toward Asia. A Berlin-Moscow rapprochement makes parts of Central\nand northern Europe more than jittery.\n\nBy 2027, Poland will be on the path to its own nuclear weapons. It was a grave\nmistake, Warsaw will explain, that Ukraine ever gave theirs up in the\n1990s\u2014and placed faith in the security assurances of Britain and the United\nStates. The European unity that came about initially as a result of Russia\u2019s\nfull-scale invasion of Ukraine will be a distant memory. The EU will splinter\nbetween Russia hawks and peace-pragmatists. As the United States steps back,\nIran will step forward to drive new wedges between Europe and Israel.\nMercantilism returns. It fits the evolving and energetic nationalist Zeitgeist\nand appears to more manageable than what\u2019s now maligned as the old \u201chuman\nrights-centered\u201d foreign policy.\n\nIrredentism is back. Budapest talks about Greater Hungary. This includes\nHungarians who comprise the third-largest minority in Ukraine. Far-right\nRomanians will gain momentum and want back territories that currently belong\nto Ukraine and Moldova. Hungary also has claims in Romania. War will threaten\nthe Balkans and talk of Greater Serbia will make headlines again. Russia\u2019s war\non Ukraine set precedent. Nations can change borders by force.\n\nHybrid war goes wild. Russia will rail about endangered ethnic Russians in\nLatvia, Lithuania, and Estonia\u2014and use cyberattacks, disinformation, and\nassassination to destabilize. NATO will worry about pretexts for intervention,\nbut signal there\u2019s little it can do under present circumstances. No one wants\nWorld War III. By now Georgia is firmly in the Russia camp, Turkey is all but\ngone from NATO, and Russia is preparing for another go at Kyiv.\n\nUkrainian politics will be fragmented and dysfunctional. Reconstruction will\nbe slower and more expensive than expected. Polish-Ukrainian relations will be\nfraught with farmers and truckers feuding through border blockades. No one in\nthe West can stomach the idea of another full-scale Russia-Ukraine war. The\nluster will have vanished from Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who started as Ukraine\u2019s\nChurchill but who now, out of power, will be blamed by everybody for the\nimmense war costs of 2022\u20132025 and a bad outcome.\n\nChina will be having a field day. Chinese Communists wanted the United States\nhumbled over Ukraine and thinking twice about the defense of Taiwan. Beijing\nwanted Russia as its wingman and America marginalized in this part of the\nworld. It had long seen southeastern Europe and the Black Sea region as a\ngateway to wider Europe. Splitting America from an internally divided EU is\nnow an achievable goal for the Russians and the Chinese.\n\nAnd what if the United States is led by our own Kaiser Wilhelm?\n\nDuring Wilhelm II\u2019s time, Austria-Hungary was coming apart. Nationalist\nawakening was everywhere. Trust in any sort of consensual politics was\neroding. Faith in armies over process and parliaments had taken root. The\nKaiser wasn\u2019t responsible for these trends, but his reckless, erratic\nleadership and narcissism fed them. A close adviser to Kaiser Wilhelm\nobserved:\n\n> Wilhelm II takes everything personally. . . . He cannot stand boredom;\n> ponderous, stiff, excessively thorough people get on his nerves and cannot\n> get anywhere with him. Wilhelm II wants to shine and to do and decide\n> everything himself. What he wants to do himself unfortunately often goes\n> wrong. . . . To get him to accept an idea one has to pretend that the idea\n> came from him.\n\nWilhelm was bellicose abroad and divisive and vicious at home. \u201cBehead the\nsocialists,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may come about that I order you to shoot down your\nown relatives.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll see about America 2025. You don\u2019t have to believe in dystopian futures,\nthough, to grasp the current nature of the problem. Our excessive concern\nabout escalation\u2014and our unwillingness to define clear war aims\u2014has meant\nwe\u2019ve never given freedom-fighting Ukrainians the full military firepower they\nneed to prevail in this war.\n\nAdversaries and allies alike are watching. A clock is ticking and you can feel\nvictory slipping away. It\u2019s not too late to provide Ukraine with the\nadditional weaponry it urgently needs and a path to victory. Imagine what\ndefeat looks like.\n\nJeffrey Gedmin is co-founder and editor-in-chief of American Purpose.\n\nImage: Details from a Soviet-era mural in Kursk, Russia.
