It's also a problem that's growing as more of the world\ndevelops. So the race has been on to find solutions for a material that's\nresponsible for roughly 8% of global carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nNow one California startup has developed a technology that reduces carbon\ndioxide in the making of cement and could have the potential to operate at\nlarge scale. Fortera intercepts carbon dioxide exhaust from the kilns where\ncement is made and routes it back in to make additional cement. In its first\neffort at commercial scale, the technology is being added to a CalPortland\nfacility in Redding, California, one of the largest cement plants in the\nwestern U.S. It opens Friday.\n\n\"Our target is about being a ubiquitous solution that can work really at any\nplant,\" said Ryan Gilliam, Fortera CEO.\n\nInitially Fortera will produce enough to mix with about one-fifth of\nCalPortland's product in a blend that reduces carbon by about 10%. Gilliam\nsaid there is a strong demand for higher blends that reduce carbon by 40-50%,\nand for a pure product the company makes, which has 70% lower carbon.\n\nThe first large sacks are scheduled to move out the door of the Redding plant\nthe first week of May.\n\nFortera evolved in part out of an earlier company called Calera that was among\nthe first to convert carbon dioxide into cement starting in 2007. It poured\nsome 100 tons of its low-carbon cement into California office buildings and\nsidewalks but shuttered in 2014 due to financial challenges. Building on that\nknowledge, Gilliam founded Fortera in 2019 with several former Calera\nemployees.\n\nA mortar cube is tested for compressive strength in the product lab at\nFortera's facility in San Jose, Calif., Wednesday, April 10, 2024.

Because it works with these\nexisting plants and uses the same material the industry already uses, Fortera\nsays its technology is an economically competitive option to quickly prevent\ncarbon emissions from warming the planet.\n\nOne difference from some other low-carbon cement and concrete efforts is it\noffers at least the possibility of being installed widely at cement plants\ninstead of changing how the industry currently runs.\n\nFortera's is one of many efforts to reduce the climate impact of concrete. The\nAmerican Institute of Architects educates many of the world's largest\narchitecture firms about carbon emissions from building materials.\n\nSome jurisdictions including Vancouver, British Columbia have building\nstandards that encourage lower-carbon concrete. California passed a law in\n2021 that requires the state's Air Resources Board to develop a strategy for\nthe state's cement industry to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by\n2035 and achieve net zero by 2045.\n\nMaterials rest in an area used for the ReCarb process at Fortera's facility in\nSan Jose, Calif., Wednesday, April 10, 2024.

Credit: AP Photo/Benjamin Fanjoy\n\nThe First Movers Coalition, an organization of more than 90 companies, has an\ninitiative announced in 2021 to create greater demand for low-carbon cement\nthrough their immense buying power.\n\nThe same year, 40 of the largest cement and concrete manufacturers announced a\ncommitment to making concrete that does not contribute to climate change by\n2050 through the Global Cement and Concrete Association. They agreed to reduce\nemissions from cement, fossil fuel use in manufacturing processes and to\ndevelop new ways to capture carbon.\n\nConcrete is the second -most used product on Earth, aside from water. Cement\nmakes up 10-15% of concrete by volume, but accounts for 88% of concrete's\nconsiderable emissions. Other ingredients in concrete are sand, gravel,\ncrushed stone and water.\n\nManufacturing one ton of cement emits nearly one ton of carbon dioxide. There\nhasn't been a simple replacement.\n\n\"The societal benefits of concrete are absolutely immense ... it's the\nbackbone of modern society,\" said Thomas Guillot, CEO of the Global Cement and\nConcrete Association. Other materials sometimes fail to compete because they\nare not as durable, can't support as much weight, or can't stand up as well to\nheat, he said.\n\nA concrete cylinder is removed after being tested for compressive strength at\nFortera's facility in San Jose, Calif., Wednesday, April 10, 2024.

Its technology works at around 1,800\u00b0F\n(1,000\u00b0C), which requires less energy and emits less carbon.\n\nWhen the captured carbon dioxide is mixed with calcium oxide, it turns into a\nkind of limestone that becomes cement-like when wet. This product, which\nFortera calls ReAct, is blended with other ingredients to make concrete.\n\nFortera uses a 15% blend of ReAct in concrete because that is all that is\nallowed under existing industry standards that regulate material strength and\ndurability.\n\nThe company is trying to get a product that is 100% ReAct approved as a\nreplacement for cement and says its testing has shown it can meet\ninternational requirements, but the regulatory process will take over five\nyears.\n\n  * ReAct Pure, center, rests in a jar in the process lab at Fortera's facility in San Jose, Calif., Wednesday, April 10, 2024.
