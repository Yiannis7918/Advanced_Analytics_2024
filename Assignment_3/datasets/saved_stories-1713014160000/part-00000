The Biden\nadministration is funneling money into making vulnerable roads and bridges\nmore resilient.\n\nBy Justine Calma, a senior science reporter covering energy and the\nenvironment with more than a decade of experience. She is also the host of\nHell or High Water: When Disaster Hits Home, a podcast from Vox Media and\nAudible Originals.\n\nApr 12, 2024, 4:03 PM UTC\n\n## Share this story\n\nA 20-foot chunk of Newport, Rhode Island\u2019s beloved Cliff Walk broke off and\ndove into the depths of the ocean in a significant landslide and partial\ncollapse, pictured on March 4th, 2022.\n\nPhoto by Jonathan Wiggs / The Boston Globe via Getty Images\n\nThe US Department of Transportation (USDOT) is doling out nearly $830 million\nin grants to 80 different projects aimed at strengthening US infrastructure\nagainst climate change.\n\nThe funding will fan out over 39 states and territories to projects ranging\nfrom refurbishing aging bridges to expanding emergency evacuation routes. The\ngrants are \u201cthe first of their kind,\u201d according to USDOT, which is partnering\nwith state, local, and tribal governments thanks to funding made available\nthrough the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\n\nClimate change is intensifying risks to the nation\u2019s transportation\ninfrastructure. The number of billion-dollar weather disasters reached a\nrecord high last year. And even slow-moving calamities like rising seas are\nforcing communities to adapt to changing landscapes.\n\nThe number of billion-dollar weather disasters reached a record high last year\n\n\u201cFrom a drought causing the halt of barge traffic on the Mississippi River to\nsubways being flooded in New York, extreme weather, made worse by climate\nchange, is damaging America\u2019s transportation infrastructure, cutting people\noff from getting to where they need to go, and threatening to raise the cost\nof goods by disrupting supply chains,\u201d Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg\nsaid in a press release.\n\nThe USDOT has pots of cash for four different types of projects. Roughly $45\nmillion will go into 10 projects to build out evacuation routes. Another $45\nmillion will be funneled into planning projects that include preparing for\nevacuations and conducting vulnerability assessments. Eight projects to\nprotect or relocate coastal infrastructure, including roads and highways, will\nget $119 million, including the Manasota Key Bascule Bridge used for storm\nevacuations in Florida and a stretch of the Newport Cliff Walk in Rhode Island\nthat collapsed in 2022.\n\nThe biggest chunk of money \u2014 $621 million \u2014 is earmarked for other types of\n\u201cresilience improvement.\u201d That includes 36 projects aimed at making roadways,\nbridges, and other transportation infrastructure more impervious to flooding,\nrising temperatures, and other consequences of climate change.\n\nThe Oglala Sioux Tribe, for example, was awarded a $60 million grant to\nimprove Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Route 33, a key route through rural\nsouthwestern South Dakota and the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. The money\nwill be used to raise parts of the road and lay down pavement better suited to\nwithstanding flooding, snow, and ice. The plan also includes widening the road\nand adding shoulders to be used in emergencies.\n\n### Related\n\n  * A moonshot for infrastructure\n\nThe USDOT has a full list of the awardees on its website. All in all, the\nBipartisan Infrastructure Law includes $50 billion for climate resilience and\nadaptation.\n\nThe Biden administration recently launched ARPA-I, a research and development\nproject specifically for infrastructure that was also authorized through the\nBipartisan Infrastructure Law. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to spend tens of billions of\ndollars every year maintaining and upgrading what we\u2019ve got, let\u2019s invest a\nlittle bit and figure out how to make what we have last longer,\u201d Buttigieg\ntold The Verge of the initiative last year. \u201cDesign things that we can\u2019t even\nimagine today.\u201d\n\nMost Popular\n\nMost Popular\n\n  1. ## The Google One VPN service is heading to the Google graveyard\n\n  2. ## Discord is nuking Nintendo Switch emulator devs and their entire servers\n\n  3. ## Humane AI Pin review: not even close\n\n  4. ## Apple\u2019s latest sci-fi series is the trippy Dark Matter\n\n  5. ## Sony\u2019s new headphones and speakers are all about skull-rattling bass\n\nFrom our sponsor\n\nAdvertiser Content From\n\n## More from Science\n\n  * ### Taking CO2 out of the air would be an absurdly expensive way to fight climate change\n\n  * ### The Weather Channel\u2019s parent company has a new AI tool to make hyperlocal weather videos\n\n  * ### The US finalizes rules for \u2018forever chemicals\u2019 in drinking water\n\n  * ### In a first, international court upholds right to be safe from climate change\n\n  * Advertiser Content From\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Notice\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Info\n  * Licensing FAQ\n  * Accessibility\n  * Platform Status\n  * How We Rate and Review Products\n\n  * Contact\n  * Tip Us\n  * Community Guidelines\n  * About\n  * Ethics Statement\n\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Jobs @ Vox Media\n\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
