Every weekday, you'll get fresh, community-driven stories that catch\nyou up with our independent local news.\n\nA stretch of Highway 1 in Big Sur is closed indefinitely after the southbound\nlane eroded during last weekend's rainstorm, bringing uncertainty to the\ncommunities that rely on the road for transportation.\n\nAs Caltrans works to repair the road, which is closed from Limekiln State Park\nto Palo Colorado in Monterey County, the agency is coordinating convoys for\nresidents and essential workers to enter and exit the area for food and\nsupplies. The state is now working on a temporary fix that would allow\nresidents and visitors to pass using the structurally stable northbound lane\nof traffic.\n\nIt's one of several closures along this stretch of Highway 1 in recent years,\nas slides during the rainy season wash rocks down.\n\nThat's because the area's mountainous terrain and steep cliffs \u2014 the very\nthing that makes the area a world-famous road trip destination \u2014 are what\nmakes the road so prone to rapid erosion, or slip-outs.\n\nSupport for LAist comes from\n\nBecome a sponsor\n\n## How geology explains the slip-outs\n\nIt might not have crossed your mind when you're driving on that part of\nHighway 1, but the road was built on highly unstable ground, full of faults\nand fractures in the ground that leave the area prone to rockslides,\nespecially after heavy rainfall.\n\nIn short, the Big Sur coastline is \"a road builder's nightmare,\" said Dick\nNorris, marine geologist at University of California San Diego's Scripps\nInstitution of Oceanography.\n\nThe Big Sur coast.\n\n(\n\nEzra Shaw\n\n/\n\nGetty Images\n\n)\n\nThe Brief\n\n  * Eclipse Weather\n\nExpect clear skies for Monday\n\n8 hours ago\n\n  * Long Beach Chicanos\n\nExhibit tells untold story of '70s activists\n\n11 hours ago\n\n  * Mosquito Season\n\nYup, the \"ankle biters\" are back\n\n11 hours ago\n\nAccording to Norris, much of Highway 1 was built downhill from the location of\nprevious rockslides \u2014 and once a slide has happened, it's more likely to\nrecur.\n\n\"I think that probably many of the current slides are old slides that are\nbeing reactivated,\" Norris said. \"Then of course, the material that the\nroadbed is built on is oftentimes an old slide deposit.\"\n\nAs we've seen in the last several years, this unstable soil can lead to\nintensive, and often costly, repairs.\n\n\"The ideal thing I suppose would be to have the road far inland from where it\nis: instead of on the cliff, farther up, in towards the interior,\" Norris\nsaid. \"As we know, the whole point about why Big Sur is so beautiful is that\nit's so bloody steep. And the steepness reflects both the active erosion that\nis going on there all the time, and then, of course, a lot of that erosion is\nhappening through these big slides.\"\n\nThe composition of these rocks is similar to much of the California coast \u2014\nthough Norris, who's done field work in Big Sur, said the region is especially\naffected by slides since closing the often-unstable Highway 1 can strand\nresidents.\n\nSupport for LAist comes from\n\nBecome a sponsor\n\nThis unstable terrain across the region leads to something like a long-term\ngame of Whac-A-Mole \u2014 once one segment of Highway 1 is fixed, another section\ninevitably erodes before long.\n\nA section of California's famed Highway 1 collapsed into the ocean following\nheavy rains over the weekend.\n\n(\n\nJustin Sullivan/\n\n/\n\nGetty Images\n\n)\n\n## What workers do after a collapse\n\nThe first step for engineers after any slip-out or slide occurs: assessing the\ndamage.\n\nCaltrans workers first went out to survey the collapsed highway on March 31,\nthe day after the slip-out, and determined that the site was stable enough to\nrun convoys along the stretch twice a day, according to Caltrans District 5\nspokesperson Jim Shivers \u2014 though Caltrans is still exercising caution.\n\n\"While stable, it is expected to see some further recession as the slope comes\nto a state of equilibrium,\" Shivers wrote in an email to LAist.\n\nNext, engineers will stabilize the edge of the road, drilling into parts of\nthe rock that is known to be competent, i.e. stable enough to support pillars.\nThen, they will insert dowels into the rock and reinforce the area with\nshotcrete, or concrete that is projected pneumatically.\n\n\"Once this work is completed, a traffic signal can be put in place and\nutilized to allow unlimited access to the traveling public,\" Shivers wrote,\nnoting that the edge stabilization work needs to take place before Caltrans'\nplanned temporary solution.\n\nThis traffic signal would allow for more regular traffic to pass on the stable\nnorthbound lane without the assistance of workers. Currently, the only public\naccess allowed on the eroded part of Highway 1 \u2014 the only way for Big Sur\nresidents to leave for supplies or goods \u2014 takes place on twice-daily convoys.\n\nCaltrans engineers are still determining how best to repair the stretch of\nroad after the temporary traffic signal is installed. Possible solutions\ninclude building a bridge, wall or viaduct, according to the agency.\n\nThere is some precedent for this repair: When a similar failure took place\njust south of this location in 2011, engineers ended up fixing the stretch of\nroad by constructing a viaduct.\n\nA hole is visible where a section of southbound Highway 1 broke off and fell\nin the ocean at Rocky Creek Bridge on April 02, 2024 near Big Sur, California.\n\n(\n\nJustin Sullivan\n\n/\n\nGetty Images\n\n)\n\n## When to expect Hwy 1's full reopening\n\nShivers wrote that Caltrans currently can't say when this stretch of Highway 1\nwill reopen with a temporary traffic signal \u2014 though they anticipate more\ninformation will soon become available.\n\n\"The goal is to have a tentative schedule within the week,\" Shivers wrote.\n\nAs for the permanent fix, Shivers wrote that it may still be months before\nCaltrans will know how long the repairs and construction will take, as its\nmethod and design still need to be finalized.\n\nThat's typical for projects like this one, which often use pillars, bridges or\nretaining walls to keep the road stable and keep landslides at bay, said\nNorris.\n\n\"I don't envy [Caltrans] at all, but they are obviously getting to be experts\nat it since they've been building repairs for decades,\" Norris said.\n\nCaltrans is also working on repairing a separate stretch of Highway 1 at\nPaul's Slide that eroded in January 2023. That fix is projected to be finished\nby late this spring.\n\nWhat questions do you have about Southern California?\n\n0/240\n\n### Your contact info\n\nWe'll be in touch if we look into your question.\n\nPowered by Hearken | Terms of Service | Privacy Policy\n\nMost Read\n\n  * Transportation and Mobility\n\nDMV Now Lets People Take The Written Tests Online \u2014 And They've Got Ways To\nKeep Folks Honest\n\nYou can take the test in the comfort of your own home, twice.\n\n  * Transportation and Mobility\n\nAnother DIY LA Crosswalk Turns Permanent As Activist Group Continues To Take\nRequests\n\nThe location in East Hollywood is the fourth official crosswalk to replace\nCrosswalk Collective LA's \"unauthorized\" efforts.
