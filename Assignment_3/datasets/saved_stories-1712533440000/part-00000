Once galaxy comes back, we\u2019ll start\ncreating the automation to pull the latest of whatever we use from galaxy to\nour local instance. We\u2019ve talked before about the impact of galaxy being\ninaccessible from our infrastructure, but never really thought we\u2019d be looking\nat more than an hour. In retrospect, it was foolish to leave such a single\npoint of failure unaddressed.\n\ncybetteCarol ChenCommunity Team\n\n1d\n\nHi all, we\u2019re aware about the problems with Ansible Galaxy at the moment and\nwe\u2019re looking into it. We have a possible mitigating fix outlined, but since\nit\u2019s the weekend, we may not be able to get to a resolution before Monday.\nWe\u2019ll keep everyone informed in this thread as soon as we have updates.\n\nSincere apologies for any inconveniences caused!\n\n", "frontpage": false}
