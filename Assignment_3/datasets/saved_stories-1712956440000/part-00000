I swore I would fix it. Was it worth it?\n\nBy Chris Person\n\n4:42 PM EDT on April 9, 2024\n\n  * Share on X (formerly Twitter)\n  * Share on Reddit\n  * Share on Email\n\nThe TV in question.\n\n4Comments\n\nBack in December of last year, I was dropping off my laundry and a 24 inch JVC\nI\u2019Art was sitting on the curb, looking at me like a lost puppy. It\u2019s a\ngorgeous TV. I couldn\u2019t leave it to the elements, so I brought it home. Thus\nbegan a multi-month project to fix it and in the process learn TV repair like\nthe Sally Struthers commercials always suggested.\n\n> Found a I\u2019Art on the way to get laundry gonna see if she works\n> pic.twitter.com/ymv5vMHLNp\n>\n> \u2014 mr. \u201cjust joined a new forum\u201d (@Papapishu) December 19, 2023\n\nCRT TVs are incredible devices. Unlike today\u2019s wussy-ass electronics, you\nwould be shocked at the kind of abuse a CRT can survive after being exposed to\nthe elements and still manage to function. I\u2019ve read numerous cases on\nenthusiast Facebook groups where someone has found a TV that\u2019s been sitting\noutside and plugged it in and it\u2019s fine. As long as the tube doesn\u2019t have an\nobscene amount of burn or the glass is pristine, you often have something to\nwork with. The glass in this case was flawless, and the TV in question is one\nof my favorites.\n\nAmong CRT nerds, there are very arbitrary tier lists. I could dedicate an\nentire article to this, but generally speaking at the top you have\nprofessional and presentation monitors, followed by later era standard\ndefinition consumer TVs. 480p, HDTV and Computer CRTs are their own thing for\ncomplicated reasons, and flat screens, while nice looking, are generally\nconsidered to have worse screen geometry than rounded ones. People tend to\ngravitate towards Sony Trinitrons, but among heads the JVC D-Series is\nconsidered one of the best consumer models because it plays retro games well,\nhas a nice image, component input (YPbPr, or the red, green and blue ports),\nand a rounded screen. The TV I found was the model they made after the\nD-Series, the JVC I\u2019Art, which is functionally very similar although with a\nflat screen, making it slightly less desirable but still an incredible TV. 24\ninch TVs are the top end of desirable sizes, as anything larger than that\nbecomes increasingly difficult to move without more than one person. This TV\ndeserved a home. It deserved love.\n\nSo I got it home. I plugged it in. It turned on! It works! Well, almost. As I\npoked around more and more, I noticed something on the top of the image. It\nwasn\u2019t burn in, which I know well, but a weird other thing. I decided to go to\nthe repository of most human knowledge about this topic: a CRT Discord I\u2019m in\nand a dedicated Facebook group. I\u2019m promptly told that what I\u2019m experiencing\nis an issue called vertical foldover. A number of causes for this are\nplausible, but what probably happened was one or more capacitors on the board\nfailed. A very helpful user was also able to find the service manual for this\nspecific board, and located the caps that probably caused the issue. I was\ngetting somewhere. I just need to crack this thing open and take a peek, which\nis the hard part.\n\nThe issue with repairing a CRT is that it can be tremendously dangerous even\nwhen unplugged if you don\u2019t know what the hell you are doing. CRTs can hold a\ncharge that needs to be carefully discharged via the anode cap, and while\nthat\u2019s not a complex process, it\u2019s probably something you should learn from a\ntrained professional or someone who has done this a lot in real life, not the\ninternet. This is my way of very clearly saying that I do not recommend or\nendorse you doing this cool thing I found personally enriching.\n\nIn my anecdotal experience, the people who still like mucking around the\ninside of CRTs are either ancient TV repair people, guys from some place like\nConnecticut, or queer nerds who like circuit bending and messing around with\nvintage computer stuff for fun. I was lucky that an acquaintance from Twitter\nnamed Emily (you can follow her on Twitter/Bluesky) had done enough modding to\nbe able to show me the ropes, which was very nice. She met up with me, came\nover to my place, and like Bjork before us, we opened up the TV to peek\ninside.\n\nOpened up. Ready to go.\n\nWhenever you take apart old electronics, it can go sideways quickly. It\u2019s\nworth taking copious notes: you have to remember where your screws go and\nstore them appropriately. You take a lot of photos, and make sure that every\ncable that is potentially unplugged gets plugged in again in the exact same\nway. In the case of a TV, it helps to have a very long screwdriver to open it\nup, which is tangentially related to the most dangerous part of TV repair:\ndischarging the tube. CRTs have a little suction cup that attaches to the top\nof the tube. This is ideally done with something called a high voltage probe,\nwhich is a tool specifically for the purpose of discharging tubes and is the\ncorrect way to do this. A lot of people get by with an insulated screwdriver\nwith a wire either duct taped or banana clipped to a ground point, but my\nunderstanding is there are theoretical problems with this, and it\u2019s not going\nto be as safe as an insulated tool made specifically for the purpose.\n\nThank you MicroCenter video from 12 years ago. This guy knows way more than\nme.\n\nRegardless of the tool used, the basic principle is the same: you connect it\nto a ground point, and then, with one hand behind your back, worm the tool\nunder the weird little anode cup. You may actually hear the tube discharge.\nYou may not. We covered our bases until we were more or less certain the tube\nhad been completely discharged, then removed the cap and got to work. The\nfirst time you do this, it\u2019s a terrifying experience, but every subsequent\ntime it\u2019s distinctly less so.\n\nDamn, it looks crazy in there.\n\nThe nice thing about vintage analog electronics repair is how often the answer\nis just swapping out some old capacitors (the big tubes on circuit boards).\nJapanese capacitors from companies like Rubycon, Nichicon and Panasonic are\nalmost always a safe bet. We took extensive notes of which capacitors looked\niffy, focusing in particular the area around the heatsink near the vertical\nIC, which is responsible for the foldover. I would have used a multimeter if I\nwas thinking straight, but maybe next time. Electrolytic capacitors all have\ndifferent values which are pretty easy to diagnose because they usually say\nthem on the side in big letters, so if you don\u2019t have a manual you at least\nhave something to go on.\n\nWe put the TV back together. With the notes and some advice from someone on\nDiscord, and using the service manual as a guide, I ordered the capacitors I\nneeded from Digikey and waited.\n\nGetting PCBs made is not hard, and I now have these if I ever want to quickly\nadd an RGB input to a TV.\n\nAside from repairing an old screen, there\u2019s another reason why someone would\nwant to get inside a CRT, which is to modify it to accept RGB color. That is\nshockingly rare in American consumer CRT televisions, which were mostly\nequipped with either coaxial or RCA inputs (the yellow, white and red cables)\nwhich just shove the image into a single signal. Back in the day, if you were\nlucky, you would get S-Video, which separated the Luma and Chroma or\n(basically light and color). At the very end of American CRT TVs we got\nComponent, which is pretty good but which was not (despite having red, green\nand blue colored ports) RGB but YPbPr, which is this other super confusing\nthing where the green cable carried the light values and the two others\ncarried the colors. Europeans solved this by just inventing SCART, which had\nRGB in it, and was vastly superior and correct.\n\nMany people have modified the Disney Princess CRT to accept an RGB signal via\na SCART port. Sunthar has an entire section devoted just to this. Credit:\nSunthar's Super Sector\n\nThe process of hacking RGB into televisions is very complex and much of the\ninformation for it comes from a 171 page thread on the SHMUPS forum. Most of\nthe time it involves using a dremel or saw to put a new input in the back of\nyour TV. I did get a bunch of custom PCBs made for it thanks to Sunthar, and I\nhope to write a post about it someday, but the JVC I\u2019Art has component inputs,\nso it\u2019s really not worth the trouble to do that this time.\n\nI waited for the capacitors to arrive. During the process, this I\u2019Art just\nstayed in my office, it\u2019s still in there as I am writing this. I am lucky\nenough to have an office in New York that is large enough to accommodate a 24\ninch CRT on the ground with minimal disruption of my life, but having a street\nTV on the ground is one of those situations where once that becomes acceptable\nyour mind just accepts that there are no rules any more. You can organize tiny\nDIY projects, but when you let something that big in, chaos reigns.\n\nThe capacitors arrived. When I was finally able to clear an afternoon, I got\nto disassembling the thing like I had before with Emily. It was easier this\ntime, there was less mystery and terror, and I had a clear blueprint thanks to\nthe help and mentorship of several people. Now the hard part began, which is\ndesoldering.\n\nDesoldering sucks. The process of soldering something to a board is a joy, but\ncorrectly removing the solder and part can be thoroughly annoying. If you\nreally mess it up you risk screwing up the board permanently. There\u2019s a lot of\nways to do it. In every single instance you\u2019re going to want flux, which you\nshould have regardless for soldering. If you\u2019re fancy you can use a desoldeing\npump, which is like a soldering iron combined with a sucker. Solder wick is\nalso useful: it\u2019s a disposable copper braid that you put over a solder point\nand which sucks up the excess solder when heated. If you wanna cheat, you can\nuse wick in conjunction with Chip Quik, which is a solder with a lower melting\npoint that you add to existing solder.\n\nThis stuff rules, but it's basically cheating.\n\nThe simplest tool is a solder sucker, and most of the ones I\u2019ve used are cheap\nand awful to use, except one: the Japanese-made Engineer SS-02. It\u2019s made of\naluminum and lets you replace the nozzle with heat resilient tubing when it\ngets dirty. I cannot stress how life changing it is, and it helped me make\nquick work of the caps safely. If you learn nothing else from me, learn to\nlove this solder sucker.\n\nIf you solder with any regularity, please get this it rules.\n\nOnce the first round of caps were replaced, I reassembled the JVC, plugged it\nin, and braced myself. I powered it on, and it worked! And it looked better!\nWell, mostly. The issue was half fixed. The vertical foldover had lessened\nsignificantly, giving credence to the theory that one or more capacitors had\nfailed. I had not done a full flight of capacitors, which would have taken\nages; just a handful of the most likely ones to get started. But what\u2019s\nimportant was that I had done something far more meaningful: I had taken apart\na CRT TV, replaced parts in it and it worked. I had taken an object that was\npreviously dangerous and forbidden in my mind and made it familiar. The\nfeeling of teaching yourself a skill like that is one of the purest joys I\nknow.\n\nLooking better!\n\nI went back to the drawing board and ordered more caps, and about a month\nlater finally got around to fixing it. The foldover is gone now, but the\npicture was vibrant where it had previously been a little dull. This thing was\nmore alive than it had been in years.\n\nCapacitors replaced, with legs ready to snip (I cleaned the board after this\nwhen I was done)\n\nAnd then, after all that, I noticed it: a slight amount of burn in on the top\nand bottom of the screen. The person who owned this had probably watched a lot\nof 16:9 content. The TV works fine, but there's not a lot you can do for\nsomething like that aside from completely replace the tube. Ah well.\n\nWas it worth it? I don\u2019t need this TV. I don\u2019t plan on keeping it. I lost\ntime, money, and physical space to the process of repairing it. And yet the\nanswer is overwhelmingly yes, in part because my other CRT might die some day,\nbut also because it gave me a skill, mastery of a now-dead technology, and the\nstart of a potentially lucrative career in TV/VCR repair, just like the\ncommercial promised.\n\n> lol pic.twitter.com/uI9YyIykg5\n>\n> \u2014 mr. \u201cjust joined a new forum\u201d (@Papapishu) April 6, 2024\n\nAnyway, does anybody want a free TV with a little bit of burn-in?
