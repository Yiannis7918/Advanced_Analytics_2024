US\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken recently determined that the Rapid Support\nForces and allied militias committed war crimes and are responsible for ethnic\ncleansing in Darfur.\n\nThe WSJ said it \"tracked Starlink sales on numerous Russian online retail\nplatforms,\" \"interviewed Russian and Sudanese middlemen and resellers, and\nfollowed Russian volunteer groups that deliver SpaceX hardware to the front\nline.\"\n\nThe WSJ described Oleg, a salesman at Moscow-based online retailer shopozz.ru,\nwho \"supplemented his usual business of peddling vacuum cleaners and dashboard\nphone mounts by selling dozens of Starlink internet terminals that wound up\nwith Russians on the front lines in Ukraine.\"\n\nStarlink terminals reportedly provide a technical upgrade to Russian troops\nwhose radio communications were being jammed or intercepted by Ukraine troops.\n\n\"In Russia, middlemen buy the hardware, sometimes on eBay, in the US and\nelsewhere, including on the black market in Central Asia, Dubai or Southeast\nAsia, then smuggle it into Russia,\" the report said. \"Russian volunteers boast\nopenly on social media about supplying the terminals to troops. They are part\nof an informal effort to boost Russia's use of Starlink in Ukraine, where\nRussian forces are advancing.\"\n\nThese \"middlemen have proliferated in recent months to buy the user terminals\nand ship them to Russian forces,\" the report said.\n\n## Lawmakers doubt SpaceX compliance with sanctions\n\nToday's report came about a month after two Democratic lawmakers sent a letter\nto SpaceX alleging that Russia's use of Starlink in Ukraine raises questions\nabout SpaceX's \"compliance with US sanctions and export controls.\"\n\n\"We are concerned that you may not have appropriate guardrails and policies in\nplace to ensure your technology is neither acquired directly or indirectly,\nnor used illegally by Russia,\" said the letter from US Reps. Jamie Raskin\n(D-Md.) and Robert Garcia (D-Calif.).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn February, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk denied what he called \"false news reports\n[that] claim that SpaceX is selling Starlink terminals to Russia,\" saying\nthat, \"to the best of our knowledge, no Starlinks have been sold directly or\nindirectly to Russia.\"\n\nWe contacted SpaceX today and will update this article if we get a response.\n\nRussia has said it doesn't allow Starlink use. A spokesperson for Russian\nPresident Vladimir Putin said in February that Starlink \"is not certified [in\nRussia], therefore it cannot and is not officially supplied here. It cannot be\nused in any way.\"\n\nThe Journal report said that US adversaries have been able to connect to\nsatellites after dealers who sell Starlink terminals \"register the hardware in\ncountries where Starlink is allowed.\" SpaceX uses geofencing to limit Starlink\naccess, and Musk has said that \"Starlink satellites will not close the link in\nRussia.\" But blocking Russian use of Starlink in Ukraine without affecting\nUkraine troops' use of the service would likely be more complicated.\n\n## Ukraine, Sudan ask SpaceX for help\n\nUkraine's top military-intelligence officer, Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, said in\nan interview that \"Russian invasion forces in his country are using thousands\nof Starlink satellite Internet terminals, and that the network has been active\nin occupied parts of Ukraine for 'quite a long time,'\" according to a WSJ\nreport in February.\n\nThe Journal's new report states that \"Ukrainian officials said they contacted\nSpaceX about Russian forces using Starlink terminals in Ukraine and that they\nare working together on a solution.\" The report also quotes US Assistant\nSecretary of Defense for Space Policy John Plumb as saying that the US is\n\"working with Ukraine and we're working with Starlink\" on how to end Russian\nuse of Starlink in Ukraine.\n\nThe RSF reportedly uses Starlink in fighting against government forces.\n\"Sudanese military officials and unauthorized Starlink dealers said in\ninterviews that Abdelrahim Hamdan Dagalo, the RSF's deputy commander, has\noverseen the purchase of hundreds of Starlink terminals from dealers in the\nUnited Arab Emirates,\" the WSJ report said.\n\nThe report also said that \"Sudanese authorities have contacted SpaceX and\nrequested help in regulating the use of Starlink, including by allowing the\nmilitary to turn off service areas where it was helping the RSF. Starlink\nnever responded to the request, Sudanese officials said.\"\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n163\n\nJon Brodkin Jon has been a reporter for Ars Technica since 2011 and covers a\nwide array of telecom and tech policy topics.
