While companies are heavily investing in AI tech that can\ngenerate business memos or code, the cost of running advanced AI models is\nproving to be a significant hurdle. Some services, like Microsoft's GitHub\nCopilot, drive significant operational losses.\n\n### Further Reading\n\nMicrosoft 365\u2019s Copilot assistant for businesses comes with a hefty price tag\n\nGenerative AI models used for creating text are not cheap to operate. Large\nlanguage models (LLM) like the ones that power ChatGPT require powerful\nservers with high-end, energy-consuming chips. For example, we recently cited\na Reuters report with analysis that claimed each ChatGPT query may cost 4\ncents to run. As a result, Adam Selipsky, the chief executive of Amazon Web\nServices, told the Journal that many corporate customers are unhappy with the\nhigh running costs of these AI models.\n\nThe current cost challenge is tied to the nature of AI computations, which\noften require new calculations for each query, unlike standard software that\nenjoys economies of scale. This makes flat-fee models for AI services risky,\nas increasing customer usage can drive up operational costs and lead to\npotential losses for the company.\n\nSome companies are trying to dial back costs, while others continue to invest\nmore deeply in the tech. Microsoft and Google have introduced more expensive\nAI-backed upgrades to their existing software services, while Zoom reportedly\ntried to reduce costs by sometimes using a less complex in-house AI model for\nsome tasks. Adobe is approaching the problem with activity caps and charging\nbased on usage, while Microsoft and Google are typically sticking with flat\nfees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMicrosoft's head of corporate strategy, Chris Young, thinks seeing a return on\ninvestments in AI will take additional time as people figure out the best ways\nto use it. \"We\u2019re clearly at a place where now we\u2019ve got to translate the\nexcitement and the interest level into true adoption,\" he told the outlet.\n\nNotably, the WSJ report claims that Microsoft's GitHub Copilot, which assists\napp developers by generating code, has been operating at a loss despite\nattracting more than 1.5 million users and integrating into nearly half of\ntheir coding projects. Users pay a flat fee of $10 a month for the service,\nbut the cost to Microsoft exceeds $20 a month per user on average, according\nto a person familiar with the matter. In some cases, individual power users\nhave cost the company as much as $80 a month.\n\nOne of the reasons AI services are so costly is that some companies have been\nreaching for the most powerful AI models available. For example, Microsoft\nuses OpenAI\u2019s most complex LLM, GPT-4, for many of its AI features. GPT-4 is\namong the largest and most expensive AI models to operate, demanding\nsignificant computing power. The WSJ quipped that using this model for basic\ntasks such as summarizing an email is like \"getting a Lamborghini to deliver a\npizza,\" suggesting that using the most capable AI models can be overkill for\nsimple tasks.\n\n### Further Reading\n\nTired of shortages, OpenAI considers making its own AI chips\n\nAlong these lines, Microsoft has been exploring less costly alternatives for\nits Bing Chat search engine assistant, including Meta's Llama 2 language\nmodel. However, over time, due to advances in AI acceleration hardware, the\ncosts to operate these complex models will likely come down. Whether those\nadvancements can come soon enough to match this year's hype cycle over AI is\nuncertain.\n\nWhile there's still excitement in the sector, the WSJ reports that we might be\nnear the peak before a reality check sets in. Some experts anticipate a more\nstringent financial approach in the near future, highlighted by May Habib, CEO\nof generative AI firm Writer, who told the outlet, \"Next year, I think, is the\nyear that the slush fund for generative AI goes away.\" This suggests that we\nmay soon see the industry transition from enthusiasm and experimental budgets\nto a phase where the focus will be on whether these AI models can actually\ncontribute to company profitability.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n106\n\nBenj Edwards Benj Edwards is an AI and Machine Learning Reporter for Ars\nTechnica.
