There is something truly empowering in being able to\nassist others where and when help is needed. I'm not merely talking about\nchecking a box in your list of KPI goals so you can qualify for your bonus; I\nmean genuinely providing assistance. Similarly, receiving help when you need\nit the most, from someone who doesn\u2019t expect anything in return, can be truly\ntransformative. However, not everyone understands what it means to extend\nassistance and support their colleagues in a meaningful way, and conversely,\nnot everyone understands what it takes to be able to ask for assistance. These\nare two important life skills that are often overlooked.\n\nIn this write-up as well as a few more to come, I invite you to read, pause,\nand reflect on what it truly means to Lead with Empathy \u2014 from my point of\nview, at least. But before we delve in, please allow me to share an experience\nwith you.\n\nIn my initial role as an Engineer, transitioning from a Graphic/Web Design\nposition at an Agency, I was engulfed in trepidation. That I was somehow going\nto stand out as the fraud I thought I was. How dare I teach myself how to code\nusing free online material, and have the audacity to call Computer Science\ngraduates my equals. I honestly didn\u2019t feel like I belonged among such\nbrilliant minds. Yes I was determined to prove to both myself and others that\nI wasn't bad a programmer. That I was willing to put the work in and earn my\nseat. However, I don\u2019t think my line manager at the time was prepared to make\nthe transition easy for me.\n\nI recall numerous instances where I struggled with my code, and he would swoop\nin from nowhere, offering suggestions and quoting profound extracts from Uncle\nBob\u2019s Clean Code manual with great prowess and confidence. \u201cDon\u2019t do this, it\nviolates principle XYZ\u201d and sometimes from the other end of the office, \u201cYou\nare spending too much time on that, please ask for help if you are getting\nstuck\u201d. Perhaps this was his way of helping or offering assistance, but each\nintervention left me feeling less supported, less confident in my abilities,\nand increasingly anxious in my role. Pair programming felt like practical\nexams I needed to have studied for, and code reviews felt like a witch-hunt. I\nreached a point where I began to dread coming to work, to the extent that it\nstarted taking a toll on my mental and physical health. I wasn\u2019t sleeping\nenough because I was spending my nights overcompensating for the CS degree I\nhadn\u2019t earned.\n\nFast forward to 2024, and I find myself in a leadership position in a FinTech\nwith millions of customers sending and receiving money across 3 continents,\nand fortunate to have gained experiences that can ease the transition journey\nfor others. Yet, I observe in some of my peers what I once experienced with my\nline manager all those years ago. Therefore, with the goal of nurturing a new\ngeneration of leaders who prioritise empathy, I wish to share some of the\ninsights I've gathered over the years \u2014 both as someone who needed guidance\nand as someone from whom guidance is expected.\n\nBefore we delve into how to offer help, let's take a brief moment to\nunderstand why we ask for it.\n\n###\n\nWhy do we ask for help?\n\nThere are probably as many reasons for seeking help as there are individuals\nfrom whom we can seek it. Meaning, There are numerous diverse motivations or\ncircumstances that lead people to seek assistance or support. We are probably\nmore likely to ask for help in environments where we feel we might receive it.\nBeyond the social aspect of collaborating in the workplace to get things done,\nwe seek help for a myriad of psychological reasons.\n\nPerhaps as a coping mechanism for workplace pressures. Expressing\nvulnerability to a fellow colleague, for example, allows us to regulate our\nemotions. The reciprocal response not only fosters a sense of belonging but\nmakes us feel supported. Like we have an ally, and this feeling of support can\nalleviate the burden of thinking we need to face difficulties alone.\n\nPerhaps we want to be validated in our thinking, or perhaps we want to express\nto others the desire to learn from them.\n\nAs you can see, there could be a lot of reasons for seeking help. Some\nobvious, and some not so much. But what is clear is that not everyone that\nasks for help is helpless.\n\nAs leaders, we have a responsibility that stretches beyond just assisting our\ncolleagues past a deployment issue. We have a responsibility to ensure that\nour colleagues receive the help they need, instead of the help we think they\nwant. This means really understanding the reason they came to you for help in\nthe first place.\n\nBeing attuned to the needs of others goes beyond technical problem-solving;\noften, this is just the tip of the iceberg. It involves active listening,\nempathy, and a sincere effort to comprehend the underlying challenges. By\ntaking the time to observe and understand someone's unique perspective,\nchallenges and motivations, we can offer more targeted and meaningful support.\n\nHowever, putting all of this into practice is easier said than done. That's\nwhy I've started working on a framework to assist me in my journey of\nunderstanding the true meaning of being a helpful colleague, brother, future\nhusband, and father. Initially, I created a series of steps for my own use.\nHowever, after successfully applying these steps within my circles of\ninfluence and witnessing the positive effects they've had on my relationships,\nit would be selfish not to share them.\n\nIn my next write-up, I'll be introducing what I've come to call the OAREF\nframework. It's a practical framework that integrates elements of keen\nobservation, active listening, relational empathy, collaborative engagement,\nand consistent follow-through. This framework offers a comprehensive approach\nto providing meaningful support to others. I can\u2019t wait to share it with you!\n\nThanks for reading The Future CEO \ud83d\ude42 Subscribe for free to receive new posts\nand support my work.\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Leading with Empathy\n\nelvismagagula.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Elvis Magagula\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great writing\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
