T. R. Shankar Raman via Wikipedia\n\nAn extensive analysis of satellite imagery has uncovered thousands of miles of\nunmapped roads slicing through Asia\u2019s tropical rainforests.\n\nSo-called \u201cghost roads\u201d may be laid down by miners, loggers, poachers, drug\ntraffickers, and land grabbers, often illegally. In Southeast Asia, the reach\nof such roads is \u201cseverely underestimated, with many roads being out of\ngovernment control,\u201d said Bill Laurance, of James Cook University, coauthor of\nthe new study.\n\nLeft: Roads in a swath of northeast Borneo mapped by OpenStreetMap. Right:\nRoads mapped by the new study. Courtesy of Bill Laurance\n\nFor the study, 200 volunteers spent more than 7,000 hours scanning satellite\nimages of Borneo, Sumatra, and New Guinea. In total, they traced more than\n800,000 miles of roads, at least three times as much road as found on widely\nused maps, such as OpenStreetMap. The findings, published in Nature, line up\nwith similar inventories of \u201cghost roads\u201d in Cameroon, the Solomon Islands,\nand Brazil.\n\nResearchers say that \u201cghost roads\u201d allow intruders to reach deep into the\njungle, and they warn that road-building typically precedes the destruction of\nrainforest. Roads make it possible for invaders to raze forest, eradicate\nwildlife, and drive out Indigenous people. Said Laurance, \u201cIn these findings,\nnature is the big loser.\u201d\n\n## ALSO ON YALE E360\n\nAs Africa Loses Forest, Its Small Farmers Are Bringing Back Trees\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Email\n\n### Related Articles\n\n  * #### INTERVIEW\n\n## With Sea Turtles in Peril, a Call for New Strategies to Save Them\n\nBy Richard Schiffman\n\n  * #### RIVERS\n\n## Jared Kushner Has Big Plans for Delta of Europe\u2019s Last Wild River\n\nBy Fred Pearce\n\n  * #### OPINION\n\n## Despite Official Vote, the Evidence of the Anthropocene Is Clear\n\nBy Anthony Barnosky and Mary Ellen Hannibal\n\n### More From E360\n\n  * ##### INTERVIEW\n\n#### With Sea Turtles in Peril, a Call for New Strategies to Save Them\n\n  * ##### RIVERS\n\n#### Jared Kushner Has Big Plans for Delta of Europe\u2019s Last Wild River\n\n  * ##### Energy\n\n#### A Nuclear Power Revival Is Sparking a Surge in Uranium Mining\n\n  * ##### OPINION\n\n#### Despite Official Vote, the Evidence of the Anthropocene Is Clear\n\n  * ##### INTERVIEW\n\n#### At 11,500 Feet, a \u2018Climate Fast\u2019 to Save the Melting Himalaya\n\n  * ##### Oceans\n\n#### Octopuses Are Highly Intelligent.
