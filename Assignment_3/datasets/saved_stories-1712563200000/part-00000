You can sponsor any of us or both, it doesn't matter, we split (\u2764\ufe0f Baptiste \u2764\ufe0f Christophe).\n  * Contract us for assistance, training, consulting or dev (can be as mundane as requesting to port a clj/cljs lib to cljd)\n\n# Cheatsheet\n\nWe have a cheatsheet covering ClojureDart specifics on one side and Flutter\nprogramming on the other side.\n\n# Conj 2023 talk and demo\n\nWant to see what's the workflow like? Our talk at Clojure/Conj 2023 is mostly\na live-coding session, starting from scratch and assuming no prior knowledge\nof Dart or Flutter!
