They recommend brushing at least twice a day with a\nfluoride-containing toothpaste to help prevent cavities. And they say skipping\nthe rinse after brushing allows the fluoride to stay on the teeth, providing\nadded protection.\n\nThose who prefer to rinse should rinse lightly with a small amount of water\nsuch as a sip from the hand or delay the rinse by about 20 minutes, said\nBrittany Seymour, a spokeswoman for the American Dental Association (ADA) and\nan associate professor at Harvard School of Dental Medicine.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nSkip to end of carousel\n\n###### Get Well+Being tips straight to your inbox\n\n(Abbey Lossing for The Washington Post)\n\nSign up for the Well+Being newsletter, your source of expert advice to help\nyou live well.\n\nEnd of carousel\n\nA 1999 study of more than 2,800 teenagers \u2014 age 15 and 16 \u2014 in the United\nKingdom found that those who rinsed with a cup of water after brushing had an\naverage of almost four decayed, missing or filled teeth compared with about\nthree for those who did not rinse at all. Those who rinsed with less water,\nfor example from their hand, had about 3.62 bad teeth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSkipping the rinse is not essential for people with healthy teeth, but those\nwho eat a high-sugar diet or are prone to cavities may need extra help from\nthe fluoride, said Margherita Fontana, a professor at the University of\nMichigan School of Dentistry. \u201cWhen you rinse, you are basically rinsing away\nthe active ingredients of the toothpaste that you just put on your teeth,\u201d she\nsaid.\n\nAnother option for those who want to rinse after brushing is to follow up with\na mouthwash containing fluoride, Fontana said.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nDental plaque is covered with certain acid-producing bacteria that, with help\nfrom a sugar-rich diet and poor oral hygiene, can cause cavities. Fluoride, a\nmineral, helps prevent cavities by protecting the teeth \u2014 primarily by helping\nto replace minerals that have been lost from the protective enamel and to\nreduce the amount of minerals the enamel loses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile fluoride is essential for protecting teeth, ingesting excessive amounts\nmay increase the risk of fluoride toxicity. Ingesting too much fluoride over\nan extended period during tooth development in early childhood can cause white\nspots to form on the permanent teeth, a cosmetic condition called fluorosis,\nbut it is usually mild in the United States.\n\nDental experts say the amount of fluoride that would be left on your teeth\nafter brushing is safe, though children should always be supervised when\nbrushing to make sure they do not ingest too much of it.\n\n###\n\nWhat else you should know:\n\nThe same brushing habits are suggested for children.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nFluoride-containing toothpaste is recommended as soon as they cut their teeth.\nFor children younger than 3, caregivers should brush the teeth with a smear of\ntoothpaste \u201cthe size of a grain of rice,\u201d and those age 3 to 6 should be given\nno more than a pea-size amount, according to the ADA and the American Academy\nof Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen parents and caregivers should have their children spit out as much as\npossible to avoid swallowing it, but keep the remaining fluoride on their\nchildren\u2019s teeth to help protect against cavities, said Scott Cashion, a\npediatric dentist and president of the AAPD.\n\n\u201cWe recommend that they spit it out but try not to rinse it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen\nthey go off to bed, if there's fluoride on those teeth, it's going to help\nprotect them through the night.\u201d\n\n###\n\nThe bottom line:\n\nSkipping the rinse after brushing with a fluoride-containing toothpaste \u2014 or\nrinsing lightly or delaying the rinse \u2014 allows the fluoride to stay on the\nteeth, providing added protection.\n\n### Read more from Well+Being\n\nWell+Being shares news and advice for living well every day.
