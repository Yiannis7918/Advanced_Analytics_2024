Managed by\nthe Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), this effort supports\nPresident Biden\u2019s Investing in America agenda to strengthen domestic critical\nmaterials supply chains, enhance our economic and national security, and meet\nthe growing demand for critical materials needed to ensure America leads the\nworld in the emerging clean energy economy.\n\n\u201cIn order to accomplish the goals laid out by President Biden to meet our\nclean energy targets, and support our economy and national security, it\u2019s\ngoing to take all-hands-on-deck approach and innovative solutions,\u201d said\nARPA-E Director Evelyn N. Wang. \u201cBy exploring phytomining to extract nickel as\nthe first target critical material, ARPA-E aims to achieve a cost-competitive\nand low-carbon footprint extraction approach needed to support the energy\ntransition.\u201d\n\nAmong the critical materials named in the DOE Critical Materials Assessment\n(CMA), nickel serves as an ideal target to validate the viability of\nphytomining in the U.S. due to the large number of documented nickel\nhyperaccumulation (HA) plants. Nickel is used in the cathodes of lithium-ion\nbatteries present in electric vehicles, consumer electronics, stationary\nstorage, stainless steel, metallurgy, coatings, electroplating, and other\nalloys. Nickel is crucial to global clean energy technology supply chains and\nfuture demand is expected to grow.\n\nThe new ARPA-E Exploratory Topic announced today, Plant HYperaccumulators TO\nMIne Nickel-Enriched Soils (PHYTOMINES), seeks to spur the technological\ndevelopment of phytomining in the United States that could complement current\nand future domestic sources of nickel and catalyze phytomining of critical\nminerals beyond nickel.\n\nThe targeted outcomes of PHYTOMINES are:\n\n  * Developing technologies that optimize the biotic systems which regulate the availability and uptake of nickel by hyperaccumulator plants.\n\n    * Technologies could be interventions in the soil or plant microbiome or the development of plant traits that enable the accumulation of nickel at an enhanced rate. ARPA-E envisions these projects as early-stage proof-of-concepts likely to take place in closed or open-air laboratories, greenhouses, or confined fields where light, humidity, and temperature regimes can be fully programmed.\n  * Understanding the interrelationships of the geologic, ecological and economic factors that affect the potential of phytomining.\n\n    * Possible projects include mapping HA species of interest, mineral characteristics in soil, and land ownership data for natural habitats and adjacent areas viable for phytomining, scaling opportunities, and technoeconomic and lifecycle analyses of phytomining projects.\n\nPHYTOMINES encourages partnerships between farmers, scientists, battery\nmanufacturers, steel and mining industries, and more. You can access more\ninformation on ARPA-E Exchange.\n\nARPA-E advances high-potential, high-impact clean energy technologies across a\nwide range of technical areas that are strategic to America's energy security.\nLearn more about these efforts and ARPA-E's commitment to ensuring the United\nStates continues to lead the world in developing and deploying advanced clean\nenergy technologies.\n\n###\n\n#### Press and General Inquiries: 202-287-5440 ARPA-E-Comms@hq.doe.gov\n\n  * Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy\n  * U.S. Department of Energy\n  * 1000 Independence Ave SW\n  * Washington, DC 20585\n\n  * Contact Us\n  * USA.gov\n  * Website Policies\n  * Compliance\n  * Careers & Internships\n  * White House\n\nSubscribe to our Newsletter Back to top\n\n", "frontpage": true}
