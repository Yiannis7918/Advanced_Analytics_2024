Some cells directly kill invading foes;\nothers release protein \u201cmarkers\u201d to attract immune cell types to a target.\nTogether, they\u2019re a formidable force that fights off biological threats\u2014both\npathogens from outside the body and cancer or senescent \u201czombie\u201d cells from\nwithin.\n\nWith age, the camaraderie breaks down. Some units flare up, causing chronic\ninflammation that wreaks havoc in the brain and body. These cells increase the\nrisk of dementia, heart disease, and gradually sap muscles. Other units that\nbattle novel pathogens\u2014such as a new strain of flu\u2014slowly dwindle, making it\nharder to ward off infections.\n\nAll these cells come from a single source: a type of stem cell in bone marrow.\n\nThis week, in a study published in Nature, scientists say they restored the\nbalance between the units in aged mice, reverting their immune systems back to\na youthful state. Using an antibody, the team targeted a subpopulation of stem\ncells that eventually develops into the immune cells underlying chronic\ninflammation. The antibodies latched onto targets and rallied other immune\ncells to wipe them out.\n\nIn elderly mice, the one-shot treatment reinvigorated their immune systems.\nWhen challenged with a vaccine, the mice generated a stronger immune response\nthan non-treated peers and readily fought off later viral infections.\n\nRejuvenating the immune system isn\u2019t just about tackling pathogens. An aged\nimmune system increases the risk of common age-related medical problems, such\nas dementia, stroke, and heart attacks.\n\n\u201cEliminating the underlying drivers of aging is central to preventing several\nage-related diseases,\u201d wrote stem cell scientists Drs. Yasar Arfat Kasu and\nRobert Signer at the University of California, San Diego, who were not\ninvolved in the study. The intervention \u201ccould thus have an outsized impact on\nenhancing immunity, reducing the incidence and severity of chronic\ninflammatory diseases and preventing blood disorders.\u201d\n\n## Stem Cell Succession\n\nAll blood cells arise from a single source: hematopoietic stem cells, or blood\nstem cells, that reside in bone marrow.\n\nSome of these stem cells eventually become \u201cfighter\u201d white blood cells,\nincluding killer T cells that\u2014true to their name\u2014directly destroy cancerous\ncells and infections. Others become B cells that pump out antibodies to tag\ninvaders for elimination. This unit of the immune system is dubbed \u201cadaptive\u201d\nbecause it can tackle new intruders the body has never seen.\n\nStill more blood stem cells transform into myriad other immune cell\ntypes\u2014including those that literally eat their foes. These cells form the\ninnate immune unit, which is present at birth and the first line of defense\nthroughout our lifetime.\n\nUnlike their adaptive comrades, which more precisely target invaders, the\ninnate unit uses a \u201cburn it all\u201d strategy to fight off infections by\nincreasing local inflammation. It\u2019s a double-edged sword. While useful in\nyouth, with age the unit becomes dominant, causing chronic inflammation that\ngradually damages the body.\n\nThe reason for this can be found in the immune system\u2019s stem cell origins.\n\nBlood stem cells come in multiple types. Some produce both immune units\nequally; others are biased towards the innate unit. With age, the latter\ngradually take over, increasing chronic inflammation while lowering protection\nagainst new pathogens. This is, in part, why elderly people are advised to get\nnew flu shots, and why they were first in line for vaccination against\nCovid-19.\n\nThe new study describes a practical approach to rebalancing the aged immune\nsystem. Using an antibody-based therapy, the scientists directly obliterated\nthe population of stem cells that lead to chronic inflammation.\n\n## Blood Bath\n\nLike most cells, blood stem cells have a unique fingerprint\u2014a set of proteins\nthat dot their surfaces. A subset of the cells, dubbed my-HSCs, are more\nlikely to produce cells in the innate immune system, which triggers chronic\ninflammation with age.\n\nBy mining multiple gene expression datasets from blood stem cells, the team\nfound three protein markers they could use to identify and target my-HSCs\ncells in aged mice. They then engineered an antibody to target the cells for\nelimination.\n\nJust a week after infusing it into elderly mice, the antibody had reduced the\nnumber of myHSC cells in their bone marrow without harming other blood stem\ncells. A genetic screen confirmed the mice\u2019s immune profile was more like that\nof young mice.\n\nThe one-shot treatment lasted \u201cstrikingly\u201d long, wrote Kasu and Signer. A\nsingle injection reduced the troublesome stem cells for at least two\nmonths\u2014roughly a twelfth of a mouse\u2019s lifespan. With my-HSCs no longer\ndominant, healthy blood stem cells gained ground inside the bone marrow. For\nat least four months, the treated mice produced more cells in the adaptive\nimmune unit than their similarly aged peers, while having less overall\ninflammation.\n\nAs an ultimate test, the team challenged elderly mice with a difficult virus.\nTo beat the infection, multiple components of the adaptive immune system had\nto rev up and work in concert.\n\nSome elderly mice received a vaccine and the antibody treatment. Others only\nreceived the vaccine. Those treated with the antibody mounted a larger\nprotective immune response. When given a dose of the virus, their immune\nsystems rapidly recruited adaptive immune cells, and fought off the\ninfection\u2014whereas those receiving only the vaccine struggled.\n\n## Restoring Balance\n\nThe study shows that not all blood stem cells are alike. Eliminating those\nthat cause inflammation directly changes the biological \u201cage\u201d of the entire\nimmune system, allowing it to better tackle damaging changes in the body and\nfight off infections.\n\nLike a leaking garbage can, innate immune cells can dump inflammatory\nmolecules into their neighborhood. By cleaning up the source, the antibody\ncould have also changed the environment the cells live in, so they are better\nable to thrive during aging.\n\nAdditionally, the immune system is an \u201ceye in the sky\u201d for monitoring cancer.\nReviving immune function could restore the surveillance systems needed to\neliminate cancer cells. The antibody treatment here could potentially tag-team\nwith CAR T therapy or classic anti-cancer therapies, such as chemotherapy, as\na one-two punch against the disease.\n\nBut it isn\u2019t coming to clinics soon. Without unexpected setbacks or regulatory\nhiccups, the team estimates three to five years before testing in people. As a\nnext step, they\u2019re looking to expand the therapy to tackle other disorders\nrelated to a malfunctioning immune system.\n\nImage Credit: Volker Brinkmann\n\n  * Tags\n  * Biotechnology\n  * Longevity\n\nShare\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nReddIt\n\nEmail\n\nCopy URL\n\nShelly Fanhttps://neurofantastic.com/\n\nShelly Xuelai Fan is a neuroscientist-turned-science writer.
