All keyboards are based off the\n104-key standard layout from the mid-1990s, and before that the IBM Model M\n101 key layout. But back before the IBM PC line introduced the 101 and brought\nuniformity to the home computer world, things were not standard at all. Every\nhome computer manufacturer had its ideas about what keys should be on the\nkeyboard and where they should be. This tends to cause some annoyances for\nemulating those computers, especially when the program relies on certain keys\nbeing in certain places.\n\nApple II/II+\n\nAll photos in this blog are courtesy of wikipedia  \n---  \n  \nThe original Apple II and II+ machines used a keyboard which has some\ndifferences from a modern keyboard. The most obvious difference is with the\npunctuation keys, some are in different places than your keyboard have them.\nThis will be a common theme in this article. The Return key is on the row\nabove the ASDF keys and there are left and right cursor keys underneath it.\nThe * and the : share a key, as do the + and ; and the @ is above the P while\nthe ^ is above the N. In addition, the number row shifted characters are\ndifferent, with \" above 2, & above 6, ' above 7, ( above 8 and ) above 9. Ctrl\nis where Caps Lock is on most modern computers. The Rept key on the original\nkeyboards simply instructs the keyboard controller to repeat the last key\npressed, emulators can automate this function so it does not need to be\nsupported. Reset is generally assigned a key like Break away from the main\nkeyboard cluster.\n\nWhen it comes keyboards, we generally can distinguish between position and\nfunction. When position matches function, that makes things easy for the\nemulator user. If < is next to the M key, then you don't have to worry if the\nprogram calls for <. In an Apple II, almost every key with a shift character\ncorresponds at least half to a key on a modern keyboard. The most annoyance\nyou will likely encounter is trying to play Akalabeth, the original Ultima and\nUltima II. In these games, as there were no Up and Down cursor keys, the\nReturn key was assigned for Up and the / key for Down. As this arrangement is\nnot replicated on the modern keyboard, you should remap keys.\n\nBy the time of the Apple IIe, Apple's keyboard was much closer to a modern\nkeyboard than even an IBM PC's keyboard. The open apple and closed apple\n(later option) keys usually map to the Alt Keys and the Ctrl + Reset key\nbecomes Ctrl + Break.\n\nTandy TRS-80\n\nThe TRS-80 keyboard is remarkably similar to the Apple II's, but it puts the\nReturn key on its proper row and adds Up and Down cursor keys. Instead of Esc\nand Ctrl keys on the Apple, the TRS boasts Break and Clear. One can easily see\nhow these might be mapped to Break or Esc and Delete, respectively, on a\nmodern keyboard. Most TRS-80s have a numeric keypad, which was very uncommon\nin 8-bit machines.\n\nAtari 8-bit\n\nThe Atari keyboard is not quite so bad. Absent a few changes, the number row\nuses the modern standard. The < and > keys are in odd places and the Return\nkey is above the ASDF row. The ASSDF row gets a bit tricky with ANSI keyboard\nlayouts with the horizontal Enter key because that row has one more key than\nANSI has. Fortunately those keys are generally used for cursor control, so\nthey can be put on the inverted T cursor keys of a modern keyboard. Also, the\nAtari number row has an additional key compared modern keyboards unless they\nuse the short backspace. Finally, the Atari has three function keys, Start,\nSelect and Option, and they are typically assigned to the function keys of a\nmodern machine. One has to remember which function key corresponds to which\nbutton. The fuji symbol usually gets mapped to the Alt key. The XL and XE\nmodels add a Help key as a function key and replace the fiji key with a\ndiagonally half filled key. The XE and XEGS also add symbol characters to the\nfront of most keys like a Commodore keyboard.\n\nTI-99/4A\n\nThe TI-99/4A has relatively few keys, but the number row matches the modern\nstandard pretty much exact except for the absence of the -_ key. As there are\nso few keys, many functions are assigned to alphabet keys. Typically an\nemulator should allow you to use the modern keys for those functions as well\nas the \"correct\" method of invoking them using FTCN.\n\nCommodore VIC-20/64\n\nThe Commodore machines are the first 8-bit computers where things really start\ngetting difficult when translating functions between the layout for their\ncomputers and a modern computer. Most keys on the Commodore can produce three\ncharacters or functions. Some of the keys do not have an intuitive analog,\nlike Run Stop, C= and Restore. There are extra keys on the ASDF and number\nrows. American users may find it a bit difficult to generate a \u00a3 symbol, but\nevery VIC-20 and C64 has a separate \u00a3 key.\n\nThe normal command Commdore BASIC for loading software off disk is LOAD\"*\",8,1\nbut sometimes you do not use the 1 or have to enter a filename where the * is.\nOn a modern keyboard, it may be something of a lookup to find out what keys\nwill produce those characters if you emulator does not support key remapping.\n\nWhen using a true C64 or VIC-20 new users may find themselves annoyed that\nthere is not separate Up and Down and Left and Right cursor keys. In BASIC, Up\nand Left is invoked with the Shift key and the respective Cursor Control key.\nEmulators can assign the discrete function keys to perform the shift function\nautomatically on the modern keyboard's Up and Left cursor keys.\n\nUsing the drawing characters printed on the front of a key can prove\nespecially annoying in an emulator because you cannot see the key the\ncharacter can draw without some kind of key overlay.\n\nSinclair ZX-80/ZX-81/ZX Spectrum\n\nThe ZX line of computers is even worse than the Commodore series. It does not\nstart out so bad unless you want to use BASIC or forget that the J key is used\nto enter the LOAD command. However, by the time of the ZX Spectrum +, keys are\nadded in places that do not correspond to a modern keyboard, generally on the\nleft side and the spacebar row.\n\nLabels: Apple II, Atari, Commodore, Keyboards, Tandy\n\n#### 2 comments:\n\n  1. The Wargaming ScribeJune 6, 2022 at 5:48 AM\n\nVery useful article. I did not understand why a couple of the games I covered\non Apple had left-right arrows for directions to the left & right, but were\nnot using the UP & DOWN arrow. I missed that earlier Apple II had quite simply\nno such things. Happily enough, most wargames want you to go in 6 directions\n(if using hexagons) or 8 directions (if using squares), so they had to use the\nnumbers anyway.\n\nReplyDelete\n\nReplies\n\nReply\n\n  2. bhtooefrJuly 9, 2022 at 9:27 PM\n\nAlso worth noting that most home computers followed the ASCII tradition of\nASR-33-derived layouts (we'll just ignore the Sinclairs), where Apple switched\nto IBM Selectric-inspired layouts with the //e, Lisa, and /// Plus (with the\noriginal /// being... weird), and IBM all along was using Selectric-inspired\nlayouts. (And, about that, while the original PC/XT and AT keyboards are\nfurther from modern US-layout keyboards than, say, a US-layout //e's keyboard,\nEuropean layouts didn't change significantly from the XT layout (for either\nmodern PCs or Apple layouts including the //e).\n\nReplyDelete\n\nReplies\n\nReply\n\nAdd comment\n\nLoad more...\n\nNewer Post Older Post Home\n\nSubscribe to: Post Comments (Atom)\n\n## Search This Blog\n\n## Labels\n\n  * AD&D\n  * Adventure Games\n  * AGI\n  * Analogue Nt Mini\n  * Apple II\n  * Arcade\n  * Atari\n  * Baldur's Gate\n  * Blu-ray\n  * Board Games\n  * CD-ROM\n  * ColecoVision\n  * Commodore\n  * Copy Protection\n  * Copyright\n  * D&D\n  * Demos\n  * Doctor Who\n  * DOS\n  * DOS Games\n  * DOSBox\n  * Dracula\n  * Dream Machines\n  * DVD\n  * Editorial\n  * Electronic Games\n  * Emulation\n  * Famicom\n  * Famicom Disk System\n  * Film\n  * Flash Carts\n  * FM Synthesis\n  * FPGA Console\n  * Game Audio\n  * Game Blaster\n  * Game Boy\n  * Game Boy Advance\n  * Game Boy Color\n  * Game Controllers\n  * Game Counting\n  * Game Patching\n  * Game Video\n  * GameCube\n  * Gaming History\n  * Genesis\n  * Getting Started\n  * Godzilla\n  * Gravis Ultrasound\n  * HDMI\n  * IBM PC\n  * IBM PCjr.\n  * Intellivision\n  * Japanese PCs\n  * Keyboards\n  * Lag\n  * Legal Analysis\n  * LucasArts\n  * Manos : The Hands of Fate\n  * Metroid\n  * MIDI\n  * Mods\n  * Monochrome & Hercules Graphics\n  * N64\n  * NES\n  * Nintendo\n  * Non-Gaming\n  * Non-Gaming/Computer\n  * Nosferatu\n  * NTSC Composite Artifact Color\n  * Optical Drive Emulators\n  * PC Accessories\n  * PC Booter\n  * PC Hardware\n  * Phantom of the Opera\n  * PlayStation\n  * Product Previews\n  * Product Review\n  * Productivity Software\n  * Recommended Games\n  * Repair\n  * Roland MT-32\n  * Roland Sound Canvas\n  * RPG\n  * SCUMM\n  * Sega\n  * Sega Game Gear\n  * Sega Master System\n  * Sierra\n  * SNES\n  * Sound Blaster\n  * Sound Cards\n  * Sound Recordings\n  * Super Game Boy\n  * Super Nt\n  * Tandy\n  * Tandy 1000\n  * Technical Discussion\n  * The Avengers\n  * TMNT\n  * Turbo Grafx\n  * Tutorial\n  * Ultima\n  * Video Capture\n  * Video Cards\n  * Windows\n  * Windows 9x Games\n  * Windows Gaming\n  * Yamaha\n\n## Popular Posts\n\n  * NuXT 2.0 Motherboard - A New 8088 Motherboard for your DIY PC Clone\n  * Dai Yakyuu!
