While generative AI technologies, like ChatGPT, have some playful uses,\nthey potentially come with enormous social costs and limited social benefit.\n\nTo understand these social costs, we have to understand generative AI. It\u2019s\nnot an autonomous, intelligent system, able to think and decide like we do.\nInstead, as Emily Bender and colleagues emphasize, generative AI is a mimic of\nhuman action, parroting back our words and images. It doesn\u2019t think, it\nguesses \u2013 and often quite badly in what is termed AI hallucination.\n\nUnderstanding generative AI as probabilistic systems highlights the social\ncosts that follow from their development.\n\nAI depends upon computing capacity: the more AI we deploy, the more computing\ncapacity we need. Not only does this take computing capacity away from other,\npotentially more useful activities, it requires an enormous amount of energy.\nThese environmental costs are well-known, but they will get significantly\nworse as AI spreads. Sam Altman, chief executive of OpenAI, reinforces this\npoint with his argument that AI needs an \u201cenergy revolution\u201d to be successful.\nEven leaving aside the ecological costs, AI\u2019s power-hungry nature will lead to\nrising energy prices across society.\n\nThen there\u2019s the fact that AI is underpinned by significant capital investment\nin computing infrastructure. AI is built on the back of fibre optics, servers,\ndata centres, etc. We can see the cost of this in Big Tech\u2019s corporate\nreports, which highlight the billions they\u2019ve spent and are spending on this\ninfrastructure. Big Tech now controls much of our computing capacity (which is\na social cost in itself), but we will need to invest considerably more to make\nAI commercially viable as an everyday technology. This investment could go\nsomewhere else, more useful.\n\nAI is also sucking up innovation funding, especially venture capital.\nAccording to CBS Insights, venture capital spending on generative AI jumped\nfivefold between 2022 and 2023, reaching close to US$22-billion. In a\nshrinking venture pool, that money could, again, have been used elsewhere.\nMore important, though, commentators like Ed Zitron point out that if the AI\nhype bubble bursts, which appears to be likely, then all that innovation\nfunding will have been wasted (as would all the capital investment).\n\nAs AI continues on this trajectory, it is threatening to overwhelm us with AI\nspam. AI needs data to train models, but content producers \u2013 such as\nnewspapers, websites and authors \u2013 are now challenging the scraping of their\ncopyrighted content by suing organizations like OpenAI. More critically, as AI\nbecomes saturated with AI-produced \u201cdata\u201d released into the internet, it will\ncollapse in on itself: As political economist Jathan Sadowski poetically puts\nit, we are facing the growing social cost from \u201cHabsburg AI,\u201d by which he\nmeans artificial intelligence technologies that are \u201cso heavily trained on the\noutputs of other generative AIs that it becomes an inbred mutant, likely with\nexaggerated, grotesque feature.\u201d This means hallucinations upon\nhallucinations, creating all sorts of unforeseen consequences.\n\nPerhaps most important, AI entails passing the buck for its social impacts on\nto the rest of society, even when it provides no social benefit. AI will\nnecessarily lead to significant social change and associated costs as we are\nforced to transform our social, political and economic institutions to deal\nwith the fallout from its effects. Even something as basic as AI-generated\nimages will create a collective cost when it comes to dealing with their\neffects on our political institutions; for example, it\u2019s going to cost a\nfortune to adapt our political system to protect ourselves against generative\nAI\u2019s turbo-charging of political misinformation.\n\nThe heart of the problem is that generative AI is not really designed to\naddress actual social problems. We urgently need the expertise of social\nscientists to be able to make much-needed collective decisions about the\nfuture of generative AI that we want; we can\u2019t leave it to business, markets\nor technologists. We need to turn to these experts to understand our social or\ncollective problems and the challenges we want generative AI to address. We\nthen need to work out whether \u2013 not simply how \u2013 artificial intelligence can\ncontribute to finding viable solutions, and then getting AI companies to focus\non producing those solutions.\n\n## Sign up for the Opinion Newsletter.\n\nKeep your opinions sharp and informed with a helpful summary of The Globe\u2019s\nmost provocative columns, covering politics, world affairs, business, arts,\nhealth and the way we live (subscribers only).\n\nExplore newsletters\n\nReport an editorial error\n\nReport a technical issue\n\nEditorial code of conduct\n\n## Related stories\n\n### How companies are using generative AI to make self-driving vehicles more\nsafe\n\n### As AI matures, small businesses are falling behind.
