AI is catching up with humans so quickly, in so many areas, that\nfrankly, we need new tests.\n\nStanford University\u2019s Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence\n(HAI) has released the seventh annual issue of its comprehensive AI Index\nreport, written by an interdisciplinary team of academic and industrial\nexperts.\n\nThis edition has more content than previous editions, reflecting the rapid\nevolution of AI and its growing significance in our everyday lives. It\nexamines everything from which sectors use AI the most to which country is\nmost nervous about losing jobs to AI. But one of the most salient takeaways\nfrom the report is AI\u2019s performance when pitted against humans.\n\nMore Stories\n\nMilitary\n\nGhost Shark: The huge stealth advantage of autonomous submarines\n\nRobotics\n\nVideo: Bio-inspired aquatic robot shoots through the water like a penguin\n\n### We recommend\n\nPowered by\n\n  * Targeting settings\n  * Do not sell my personal information\n  * Google Analytics settings\n\nFor people that haven't been paying attention, AI has already beaten us in a\nfrankly shocking number of significant benchmarks. In 2015, it surpassed us in\nimage classification, then basic reading comprehension (2017), visual\nreasoning (2020), and natural language inference (2021).\n\nAI is getting so clever, so fast, that many of the benchmarks used to this\npoint are now obsolete. Indeed, researchers in this area are scrambling to\ndevelop new, more challenging benchmarks. To put it simply, AIs are getting so\ngood at passing tests that now we need new tests \u2013 not to measure competence,\nbut to highlight areas where humans and AIs are still different, and find\nwhere we still have an advantage.\n\nIt's worth noting that the results below reflect testing with these old,\npossibly obsolete, benchmarks. But the overall trend is still crystal clear:\n\nAI has already surpassed many human performance benchmarks\n\nAI Index 2024\n\nLook at those trajectories, especially how the most recent tests are\nrepresented by a close-to-vertical line. And remember, these machines are\nvirtual toddlers.\n\nThe new AI Index report notes that in 2023, AI still struggled with complex\ncognitive tasks like advanced math problem-solving and visual commonsense\nreasoning. However, \u2018struggled\u2019 here might be misleading; it certainly doesn't\nmean AI did badly.\n\nPerformance on MATH, a dataset of 12,500 challenging competition-level math\nproblems, improved dramatically in the two years since its introduction. In\n2021, AI systems could solve only 6.9% of problems. By contrast, in 2023, a\nGPT-4-based model solved 84.3%. The human baseline is 90%.\n\nAnd we're not talking about the average human here; we're talking about the\nkinds of humans that can solve test questions like this:\n\nAn example MATH question asked of the AI. Yikes!\n\nHendryks et al./AI Index 2024\n\nThat's where things are at with advanced math in 2024, and we're still very\nmuch at the dawn of the AI era.\n\nThen there's visual commonsense reasoning (VCR). Beyond simple object\nrecognition, VCR assesses how AI uses commonsense knowledge in a visual\ncontext to make predictions. For example, when shown an image of a cat on a\ntable, an AI with VCR should predict that the cat might jump off the table or\nthat the table is sturdy enough to hold it, given its weight.\n\nThe report found that between 2022 and 2023, there was a 7.93% increase in\nVCR, up to 81.60, where the human baseline is 85.\n\nA sample question used to test an AI's visual commonsense reasoning\n\nZellers et al./AI Index 2024\n\nCast your mind back, say, five years. Imagine even thinking about showing a\ncomputer a picture and expecting it to 'understand' the context enough to\nanswer that question.\n\nNowadays, AI generates written content across many professions. But, despite a\ngreat deal of progress, large language models (LLMs) are still prone to\n\u2018hallucinations,\u2019 a very charitable term pushed by companies like OpenAI,\nwhich roughly translates to \"presenting false or misleading information as\nfact.\"\n\nLast year, AI\u2019s propensity for 'hallucination' was made embarrassingly plain\nfor Steven Schwartz, a New York lawyer who used ChatGPT for legal research and\ndidn\u2019t fact-check the results. The judge hearing the case quickly picked up on\nthe legal cases the AI had fabricated in the filed paperwork and fined\nSchwartz US$5,000 (AU$7,750) for his careless mistake. His story made\nworldwide news.\n\nHaluEval was used as a benchmark for hallucinations. Testing showed that for\nmany LLMs, hallucination is still a significant issue.\n\nTruthfulness is another thing generative AI struggles with. In the new AI\nIndex report, TruthfulQA was used as a benchmark to test the truthfulness of\nLLMs. Its 817 questions (about topics such as health, law, finance and\npolitics) are designed to challenge commonly held misconceptions that we\nhumans often get wrong.\n\nGPT-4, released in early 2024, achieved the highest performance on the\nbenchmark with a score of 0.59, almost three times higher than a GPT-2-based\nmodel tested in 2021. Such an improvement indicates that LLMs are\nprogressively getting better when it comes to giving truthful answers.\n\nWhat about AI-generated images? To understand the exponential improvement in\ntext-to-image generation, check out Midjourney's efforts at drawing Harry\nPotter since 2022:\n\nHow text-to-image generation has improved with progressive versions of\nMidjourney\n\nMidjourney/AI Index 2024\n\nThat's 22 months' worth of AI progress. How long would you expect it would\ntake a human artist to reach a similar level?\n\nUsing the Holistic Evaluation of Text-to-Image Models (HEIM), LLMs were\nbenchmarked for their text-to-image generation capabilities across 12 key\naspects important to the \u201creal-world deployment\u201d of images.\n\nHumans evaluated the generated images, finding that no single model excelled\nin all criteria. For image-to-text alignment or how well the image matched the\ninput text, OpenAI\u2019s DALL-E 2 scored highest. The Stable Diffusion-based\nDreamlike Photoreal model was ranked highest on quality (how photo-like),\naesthetics (visual appeal), and originality.\n\n## Next year's report is going to be bananas\n\nYou'll note this AI Index Report cuts off at the end of 2023 \u2013 which was a\nwildly tumultuous year of AI acceleration and a hell of a ride. In fact, the\nonly year crazier than 2023 has been 2024, in which we've seen \u2013 among other\nthings \u2013 the releases of cataclysmic developments like Suno, Sora, Google\nGenie, Claude 3, Channel 1, and Devin.\n\nEach of these products, and several others, have the potential to flat-out\nrevolutionize entire industries. And over them all looms the mysterious\nspectre of GPT-5, which threatens to be such a broad and all-encompassing\nmodel that it could well consume all the others.\n\nAI isn\u2019t going anywhere, that\u2019s for sure. The rapid rate of technical\ndevelopment seen throughout 2023, evident in this report, shows that AI will\nonly keep evolving and closing the gap between humans and technology.\n\nWe know this is a lot to digest, but there's more. The report also looks into\nthe downsides of AI's evolution and how it's affecting global public\nperceptions of its safety, trustworthiness, and ethics. Stay tuned for the\nsecond part of this series, in the coming days!\n\nSource: Stanford University HAI\n\nView gallery - 5 images\n\n### We recommend\n\n  1.
