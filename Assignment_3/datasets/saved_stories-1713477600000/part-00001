That\u2019s up 9% from a year earlier and 1% higher than the previous all-\ntime high in June 2022.\n\nWith rates hovering in the upper 6% range, the mortgage payment on the average\nhome now tops $5,500 \u2014 if you can put 20% down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bananas,\u201d Tommy Kotero, a 43-year-old refinery worker, said last weekend\nafter touring a dated, $899,000 house in north Torrance with visible cracks in\nthe ceiling and walls. \u201cThe asking prices for what we are getting is crazy.\u201d\n\nHow home prices hit a record despite the high cost of borrowing is a tale of\ntoo few homes for sale, combined with a wealth gap that has equipped some\nbuyers with reams of cash that negate the effect of high rates.\n\nWhen interest rates first soared in 2022, buyers backed away en masse,\ninventory swelled and home prices dropped.\n\nThen potential sellers all but went on strike, with many deciding they didn\u2019t\nwant to move and trade their sub-3% mortgages for a loan at more than double\nthat rate.\n\nInventory plunged and enough buyers returned to send home prices back up. Many\nof these buyers are well-heeled first-timers who aren\u2019t ditching a low-cost\nmortgage.\n\nCalifornia\n\n### Housing tracker: SoCal home prices at a record\n\nExplore the latest prices for homes and rentals in and around Los Angeles.\n\nMarch 14, 2024\n\nOthers are holding on to their old home and buying another. Still more are\nselling their old home and turning their considerable equity into hefty down\npayments well over 20%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPeople who have cash are not paying too much attention to interest rates,\u201d\nsaid Alin Glogovicean, a real estate agent with Redfin who specializes in\nnortheast L.A.\n\nHe estimates that in about one-third of his deals a buyer is paying all cash.\nAnother third put down at least 50%, with a mortgage on the rest.\n\nAt least two-thirds of the buyers with down payments of at least 30% aren\u2019t\ninvestors but people who want to live in the home, he said. They are\nprofessionals such as architects and Hollywood types who have saved,\nliquidated stock portfolios, built up equity or received help from family.\n\nSome are willing to dip into retirement savings \u2014 a strategy many financial\nexperts advise against.\n\nNationally, similar trends are afoot, according to a Zillow survey, with the\nshare of home buyers putting at least 20% rising, as well as those who\nreceived help from family and friends.\n\nIn all, 23% of L.A. County homes sold in February were bought with all cash,\nup from 16% in 2021, according to Redfin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor those without access to a spare half-a-mill, times are tougher.\n\nAccording to the California Assn. of Realtors, only 11% of households in Los\nAngeles and Orange counties could reasonably afford the median-priced house\nduring the fourth quarter, the smallest number since the housing bubble of the\nmid-aughts.\n\nAt that time, risky lending practices allowed people to buy homes they\ncouldn\u2019t really pay for. Today, lending standards are far tighter, which\neconomists say should prevent a similar collapse in prices if there\u2019s another\nrecession.\n\nAcross the region, home prices have now set records in Orange, San Bernardino,\nSan Diego and Ventura counties. In Los Angeles and Riverside counties, prices\nare less than 1% from their all-time highs.\n\nAgent Alicia Fombona of United Real Estate Pacific States works across the\nSouthland \u2014 from the coast to the Inland Empire. Amid high rates and high\nprices, she said, one strategy that\u2019s growing more popular is co-borrowing:\nfamily and friends coming together to buy a house or duplex to keep payments\nsomewhat affordable.\n\n\u201cEverybody needs a place to live and there is not enough housing for\neverybody,\u201d Fombona said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore homes are starting to come onto the market, but inventory is still tight\nand expected to remain so, according to forecasters. Rates may drop somewhat\nbut are expected to remain elevated.\n\nThat combination could create a scenario in which prices don\u2019t soar but also\ndon\u2019t drop much \u2014 if at all, especially because incomes for many households\nare growing.\n\n\u201cWe are going to continue to see robust price growth, but nothing near where\nwe were in the pandemic,\u201d said Orphe Divounguy, a senior economist with\nZillow.\n\nIf rates fell considerably, it would immediately make homes more affordable,\nbut a new crop of buyers probably would flood the market and could put even\nmore upward pressure on prices.\n\nTo help housing truly become more affordable, Divounguy said, there must be\ncontinued income growth and more housing construction.\n\n\u201cThe way out of this is not going to come from mortgage rates,\u201d he said.\n\nIn California, construction headed in the wrong direction in 2023, with\nbuilding permits falling from the previous year, though lately there are signs\nof a rebound in single-family construction, which is mostly for-sale homes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome Californians, however, are on a timeline.\n\nKotero, the buyer looking in Torrance, currently rents a house in the city\nwith his wife, Rikah, and their four children. But he said they need to find a\nnew place by summer because the landlord is moving back in.\n\nThey\u2019d like to buy and stay in Torrance for the schools but so far have struck\nout \u2014 even though Kotero makes $160,000 as a manager at a local oil refinery.\n\nHe said he and his wife were recently outbid, despite stretching their budget\nto offer $1 million for a house listed for $900,000.\n\nUnlike others, the Koteros don\u2019t have hundreds of thousands in cash to\nmeaningfully offset high rates. Instead, Rikah, who currently stays home with\nthe children, is thinking of looking for a job.\n\n\u201cIf we are realistically looking to buy a home in Torrance, there\u2019s no way\naround it,\u201d Kotero said.\n\n### More to Read\n\n  * For Subscribers\n\n### California housing crisis so bad once-modest towns have become \u2018million-\ndollar cities\u2019\n\nApril 15, 2024\n\n  * ### Looking to buy or sell a home this spring?
