Instead of the old way of staging, which means bringing in real\nfurniture and setting it up, they use computers to put pictures of furniture\nand decorations into photos of empty rooms. They do this with special computer\nprograms that can make 3D images, making it look like the room has furniture\nand decorations in it. Virtual staging helps agents show off a home better, in\na fraction of the time. It lets them show buyers what an empty space would\nlook like with furniture and stuff in it. This can make the home seem more\nvaluable and interesting to people looking to buy.\n\n### Why choose virtual staging instead of real-life staging?\n\nVirtual staging saves a lot of money because you don't have to buy furniture,\npay decorators, or take time to set up decorations in the house. It can be up\nto 97% cheaper than the usual way of staging a home. Also, virtual staging is\nmore flexible. You're not stuck with only a few choices for furniture because\nyou can use any style of furniture in the pictures. This gives you a lot more\noptions to pick from.\n\n### What does AI virtual staging mean?\n\nAI virtual staging is when a computer program, which learns on its own, puts\nfurniture into photos without needing a person to do it. Our special computer\nprogram can make empty rooms look like they have nice furniture and good\nlighting in the pictures. It's so good that you can't tell if a computer or a\nperson did it, or even if it's just a picture of a real room with real\nfurniture. Virtual staging with AI is also much faster than when people do it,\nchanging the wait from days to just a few seconds, and it's way cheaper too.\n\n### What types of pictures can you use?\n\nYou can add furniture to pictures of living rooms, bedrooms, dining rooms,\nkitchens, home offices, and bathrooms. We're planning to work with more kinds\nof rooms soon. You can pick from eight styles of furniture with us. If the\nroom in your picture already has stuff in it, we can clean it up and take out\nthe old furniture before we put in new furniture. You'll get a picture of the\nempty room and a picture with the new furniture in it.\n\n### How long does it take to virtually stage by AI?\n\nIt takes just a few seconds to process the image and generate a virtually\nstaged version.\n\n### How big is your furniture library?\n\nHomeStage isn\u2019t a predefined furniture library - It analyzes every room and\nbased on the style and room types generates furniture that best matches the\nroom. Therefore no two rooms will ever get the same furniture.\n\n# Instant virtual staging for your listings.\n\n#### Try now for free\n\nNo credit card required.\n\n#### HomeStage\n\n\u00a9 2023 HomeStage and \u201cHomeStage\u201d, \"HomeStage AI\" and the HomeStage logo are\ntrademarks of the company.\n\nVisit our Terms of Service for more details.
