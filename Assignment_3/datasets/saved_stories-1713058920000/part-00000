It\u2019s social. It\u2019s sustainable. This\nsignature has been our commitment for 28 years. We control our cloud\ninfrastructures and productivity solutions from end to end so that we never\nhave to make any concessions with regard to our values. We have a vision that\nwe materialise through clear commitments.\n\n## Privacy-friendly: this is the cornerstone of trust\n\n100% of Infomaniak belongs to 10% of its employees and the aim is gradually to\nopen ownership to the other employees and, in the long term, to the customers\nas well. Economic independence enables us to set our priorities in line with\nour values. Our business model is about safeguarding data, not selling it.\n\nWe target technological competence at every level. This approach enables us to\ncomply with Infomaniak\u2019s stringent data confidentiality policy. Infomaniak has\ncomplete control over the data centers, from their design to their operation.\nThe software layer that drives our cloud infrastructures and virtualisation\ntechnologies is based on OpenStack, an open-source technology recognised\nworldwide to which our engineers contribute directly. All our solutions are\ndeveloped in Switzerland by our own developers.\n\n> Technological dependence is untenable. It conditions our security and the\n> future of our economy, the competitiveness of our companies and jobs and the\n> freedom of choice of our societies. Boris Siegenthaler, Infomaniak\u2019s founder\n> and Head of Strategy\n\nInfomaniak\u2019s hardware and software independence keeps your data out of reach\nof extraterritorial information laws and far from the indiscretions of the web\ngiants, the interference of governments and any back doors.\n\nThe data you entrust to us is encrypted and stored in Switzerland as quickly\nas possible. This extremely stable framework provides one of the most\nstringent legislations in terms of data confidentiality and protection.\nInfomaniak also meets the requirements of the General Data Protection\nRegulation (GDPR).\n\n## Social: Infomaniak is above all a human adventure\n\nThe Ethical Cloud means 200 employees, 200 stories, 200 careers and 200 voice\nsharing a common desire and common principles:\n\n  * Attentiveness to our customers: our customers determine our priorities and everything we do, we do it for you. It is not by chance that our support team has been acknowledges since the very outset. You are our priority!\n  * Transparency: this is the basis for developing not trust and a long-term relationship;\n  * Horizontality: we target efficiency and commitment, independent of status or experience. At Infomaniak, anyone can suggest ideas and take initiatives.\n  * Serious work that is fun: we spend most of our time at work. Everything that can foster collaboration, benevolence, pleasure and passion on a daily basis is a must.\n  * Participatory management: the employees and soon our customers are the only shareholders in Infomaniak.\n\n> In the past 20 years, I have occupied several positions at Infomaniak. I can\n> truly say that the passion, sense of responsibility and desire to have an\n> impact here are worth all the diplomas in the world. Anne Passera, HR\n> Director at Infomaniak\n\nSome 70% of Infomaniak\u2019s employees are engineers and developers. These skills\nensure our technological independence, enabling us to react quickly to\nchanging user needs.\n\nIn light of the shortage of developers on the market, Infomaniak invests in\nthe creation of new training programmes. \u00c9cole 42, EPFL, CREA or r\u00e9alise: we\nfinance and directly contribute to the development of skills that are of\ninstant use to the sector.\n\nInfomaniak pays its taxes in Switzerland and all our employees work in Geneva\nor Winterthur. We prioritise local sourcing and, for example, we purchase\nSwissbit SSD discs manufactured in Germany and Meyer-Burger solar panels\ndesigned in Switzerland and made in Germany.\n\n## Sustainable: no compromises with regard to the climate emergency\n\nThe climate and biodiversity situations are emergencies. Out of necessity, we\nhave become pioneers of the ecological cloud, because no technology enabled us\nto achieve our environmental goals.\n\n1) Since 2007, we have set some of the most ambitious targets in the sector\nthrough our ethical and environmental charter. Our approach has been rewarded\nwith several prizes, certifications and trophies:\n\n  * We extend the service life of our servers up to 15 years (1 server represents an average of 1.7 to 2 tonnes of CO2).\n  * All our activities are powered exclusively by local, renewable and energies.\n  * We have chosen an ethical pension fund which does not invest in the sale of weapons or in authoritarian regimes.\n  * We practise fiscal transparency, not optimisation.\n  * We promote soft mobility, offering up to CHF 1,500 per year/employee.\n  * We reject commercial practices contrary to the sustainable economy, such as Black Friday.\n  * We constantly measure the impact of our actions in line with the ISO 14001 and ISO 50001 standards.\n\n2) Since 2017, we have offset CO2 emissions by 200% that we cannot reduce and\nby 100% since 2007. The difference of 100% is a guarantee that covers any\npotential measurement imprecisions.\n\n3) A total of 1% of our growth is allocated to actions which aim to make\nenvironmental protection legislation more restrictive, in particular within\nour industry.\n\nWe won\u2019t stop there: our next data center will recycle all the energy consumed\nin order to heat up to 6,000 households in winter and provide tens of\nthousands of households with hot water in the summer. We will also gradually\nintroduce solar energy installations to produce as much energy as we consume.\n\n## Infomaniak will remain independent in order to perpetuate its commitments\n\n> Infomaniak is a company that needs to generate income, but not at the\n> expense of our commitments or of what forms the cornerstone of the trusting\n> relationship we maintain with our customers who have been with us from the\n> start. Marc Oehler, Director of Infomaniak\n\nOur commitments have only grown stronger over the years and to ensure they\nremain firmly embedded, we have become a member of the Chamber of the social\nand solidarity economy (Apr\u00e8s-GE). It checks the implementation of our\ncommitments:\n\n  * Transparency\n  * Collective interest\n  * Limited pursuit of profit\n  * Respect for the environment\n  * Participatory management\n  * Social management\n\nWe have published these few lines so that, together with us, you can help\nsafeguard these principles. Your trust and loyalty enable us to write the\nstory of an independent company promoting an ethical cloud with people at\nheart. With you, we will pursue our story as far as possible.\n\nThank you for being demanding with us, and thanks for you for the trust you\nplace in us.\n\n## Find our more\n\n  * Our environmental commitments\n  * Why host your data in Switzerland, at the heart of Europe\n  * Control over data: data centers are the cornerstone of Infomaniak\u2019s independence\n  * Data center security: how does Infomaniak protect itself against the worst-case scenarios\n\n### Infomaniak develops its energy self-sufficiency with Meyer Burger solar\npower plants manufactured in Europe\n\nFriday April 5th, 2024\n\n### Greenhouse gas balance: Infomaniak publishes its 2022 report\n\nThursday February 15th, 2024\n\n### Here\u2019s how Infomaniak\u2019s sovereign cloud works\n\nMonday November 13th, 2023\n\n### Prioritising quality code : explanations and solutions for repaying the\ntechnical debt\n\nFriday August 11th, 2023\n\n### Data centers should be heating our cities\n\nMonday July 10th, 2023\n\n### Understanding ISO certifications: what are they for and are they really\nuseful?\n\nMonday May 22nd, 2023\n\nInfomaniak\n\nAbout Infomaniak Our ecological commitments Jobs and recruitment Sales contact\nSupport\n\nOur products\n\nCollaborative Tools Web & Domains Cloud Computing Events & Marketing Streaming\n\nPartnerships\n\nBecome a reseller Quote requests Affiliate programme\n\n", "frontpage": false}
