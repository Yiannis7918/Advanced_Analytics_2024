In the words of Darrell\nM. West, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, the combination of\nonline influence campaigns and artificial intelligence has created a \u201cperfect\nstorm of disinformation\u201d that threatens free and fair elections. This type of\npessimism has led several open societies\u2014including those of the European\nUnion\u2014to adopt illiberal measures such as banning foreign media outlets and\ncracking down on social media platforms. The rise of generative artificial\nintelligence has only heightened the sense of emergency.\n\nYet little attention has been paid to the fact that Team Democracy triumphed\nin one of 2024\u2019s most decisive battles by staying true to its liberal values.\n\nTaiwan is an instructive example of a young and vibrant democracy that views\nfreedom of expression as a competitive advantage against authoritarian\ncensorship and propaganda. In large part, Taiwan\u2019s response to China\u2019s\naggressive disinformation campaigns has relied on a model where organic and\ncivil society-led initiatives serve as first responders and heavy-handed\ngovernment intervention is treated with great skepticism. Taiwan\u2019s success\nprovides a proof of concept that should prompt a change of course in European\ndemocracies, which increasingly believe that preserving their open societies\nrequires sacrificing free expression.\n\n####\n\nTaiwan: A Model to Follow\n\nTaiwan lives with constant Chinese saber-rattling, but without the security\nguarantees of NATO that many European democracies can rely on vis-\u00e0-vis\nRussia. Taiwan has been the largest target of foreign disinformation for the\nlast ten years. Regardless, the January 2024 presidential election did not go\nthe way that China wanted. The pro-sovereignty Democratic Progressive Party,\nwhich promotes a national identity separate from China, won an unprecedented\nthird presidential term as Lai Ching-te swept to power replacing the term-\nlimited Tsai Ing-wen, also of the DPP.\n\nDespite deep concerns about Chinese disinformation, the election was carried\nout with minimal efforts to censor the island state\u2019s vibrant public square.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s civic tech initiatives have been instrumental in defending Taiwan\u2019s\ndemocracy and depend to a large degree on freedom of information. \u201cCivic tech\u201d\ndescribes informal volunteer and nonprofit initiatives building digital\ntechnology for the public good, aiming to make government more open. In\nTaiwan, a web of organizations mutually reinforces each other\u2019s work. By\nresearching Chinese influence operations and disinformation campaigns using\ndigital tools, think tanks like Doublethink Lab provide source attribution and\nanalysis that helps Taiwanese society tweak and patch its digital resilience\nagainst Chinese disinformation campaigns. Another vital player on Taiwan\u2019s\ncivic-tech scene is Cofacts, a crowdsourced initiative that allows users to\nsend suspected disinformation to its chatbot on Taiwan\u2019s most popular\nmessaging app, LINE, where queries are posted and fact-checked in real-time.\n\nIn the first ten days of January 2024, Cofacts received over 16,000 inquiries\nabout a DPP candidate alleged to have a mistress and illegitimate child. This\nclaim was quickly debunked by a fact-checking organization called MyGoPen.\nThis episode reinforces recent research from Cornell University which found\nthat crowdsourced sites like Cofacts often responded to queries more rapidly\nthan professional fact-checking sites, which is crucial given the speed at\nwhich disinformation can spread online.\n\nThese bottom-up and organic civil society initiatives are not at odds with but\nrather encouraged and complemented by official government policy. Audrey Tang,\nTaiwan\u2019s Minister of Digital Affairs, has pioneered a nonrestrictive policy\nbased on her philosophy of \u201cRadical Transparency.\u201d The Ministry of Digital\nAffairs\u2019 website proclaims that it combatted the COVID-19 \u201cinfodemic with no\ntakedowns.\u201d With assistance from the civic-tech collective g0v, Taiwan\u2019s\ngovernment implemented a robust contract tracing and vaccination system, while\ncivil society organizations debunked COVID-19 disinformation.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s deep skepticism of government censorship was also on display when the\nproposed Digital Intermediary Services Act was abandoned due to political and\npopular opposition. The draft law aimed to regulate platform accountability to\ncounter illegal content and ensure transparency. Taiwanese cyberlaw\nspecialists were particularly concerned that the law gave government\nauthorities powers to file for \u201cinformation restriction orders,\u201d which\u2014subject\nto court approval\u2014would limit access to online information. In the context of\nTaiwan\u2019s recent authoritarian past, many viewed the law as thinly veiled state\ncensorship and an excessive restriction on free speech. In September 2022, the\neffort to pass DISA was suspended due to sustained public pressure. Moreover,\nwhen Taiwan\u2019s communication commission took the unprecedented step of refusing\nto renew the license of a Taiwanese pro-China TV station, it was overturned in\nMay 2023 by a Taipei court, which ruled that the commission had failed to\nprovide adequate reasoning.\n\n####\n\nDisinformation in the EU\n\nThe European approach to disinformation in recent years compares\nunflatteringly to Taiwan. In 2022, the European Union banned the Kremlin-\nbacked media outlets Russia Today and Sputnik and even obliged social media\ncompanies to prevent the sharing of content originating from these outlets.\nThese events suggest legitimate concerns about disinformation from hostile\nstates have incentivized democratic governments to adopt illiberal\nregulations, which weaken the very values they are supposed to protect.\nAbsurdly, the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief argued that by prohibiting 448 million\ncitizens across 27 European democracies from accessing information, \u201cwe are\nnot attacking the freedom of expression, we are just protecting the freedom of\nexpression.\u201d\n\nUnlike in Taiwan, the separation of powers has not acted as a check on speech\nrestrictions. In July 2022, a top EU court found that the ban on RT France did\nnot violate free expression protections under EU law because the European\nCouncil enjoys \u201cwide discretion\u201d to counter Russian propaganda. Media law\nexperts have criticized the court\u2019s reasoning for failing to uphold\nfundamental principles of freedom of expression under European and\ninternational human rights law.\n\nThen, in 2023, European Commissioner Thierry Breton attracted criticism from\n28 rights groups for his communications to X, Meta, TikTok, and YouTube on the\nspread of disinformation and illegal content across their platforms following\nthe escalation of hostilities in Gaza. The groups highlighted Breton\u2019s\nconflation of illegal content with \u201cdisinformation\u201d even though the latter is\noften protected speech under international human rights law.\n\nBreton\u2019s approach not only undermines free expression and access to\ninformation in the EU but also runs the risk of emboldening and providing\ncover for illiberal regimes. There was a steady rise in laws targeting \u201cfake\nnews\u201d between 2011 and 2022, and many include imprisonment as a punishment.\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists recently recorded its second-highest\nnumber of journalists behind bars since it began keeping track in 1992. It is,\ntherefore, especially important for leading democracies to consider the global\ncollateral consequences of their counter-disinformation methods. Some\ncensorial fake news bills and laws, including Brazil\u2019s, take inspiration from\nthe European DSA.\n\nIn America, the First Amendment would\u2014for now\u2014prohibit the adoption of laws\nand measures equivalent to those enacted by the EU. But this has not stopped\nthe federal government from trying to limit information about COVID-19,\nvaccines, and the 2020 presidential election that it deemed false or\nmisleading. In September 2023, a federal court ruled that government\nofficials\u2014including at the White House, the CDC, and the FBI\u2014had likely\nviolated the First Amendment in \u201ca coordinated campaign\u201d to put pressure on\nsocial media platforms to remove constitutionally protected content (when\nargued before the Supreme Court in March, a majority of Justices seemed\nskeptical of the lower court decisions). Leaked emails appear to show that the\nBiden administration may also have pressured Amazon to remove or limit the\nvisibility of books skeptical of vaccines. Even if such measures did pass\nconstitutional muster, they are more likely to embolden the narrative of\nconspiracy theorists than to inspire trust and confidence amongst a polarized\npublic.\n\nIt is much more promising to rely on transparency and openness to bolster\nresilience. In the words of Taiwanese behavioral scientist Tzu-wei Hung, \u201cFree\nspeech is not the cost but the key to counteract disinformation.\u201d In this\n\u201cYear of Democracy,\u201d it is more tempting than ever to disregard Hung\u2019s\nadmonition as mere abstract principles. But Taiwan\u2019s success shows that\nsometimes principles and practice go hand in hand. Accordingly, Taiwan should\nbe viewed as a guiding light for how open societies can build civic resilience\nwithout sacrificing freedom of expression.\n\nJacob Mchangama is the CEO of the Future of Free Speech Project, Research\nProfessor at Vanderbilt University, and a senior fellow with the Foundation\nfor Individual Rights and Expression.\n\nFollow Persuasion on X, LinkedIn, and YouTube to keep up with our latest\narticles, podcasts, and events, as well as updates from excellent writers\nacross our network.\n\nAnd, to receive pieces like this in your inbox and support our work, subscribe\nbelow:\n\n76 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n17 Restacks\n\n76\n\nShare this post\n\n#### How to Fight Misinformation Without Censorship\n\nwww.persuasion.community\n\n3\n\nShare\n\n3 Comments\n\nFrank LeeSocial Misfit NewsletterApr 5The only way to combat disinformation is\nfree speech absolutism... especially when your own government is the primary\nsource of disinformation.Expand full commentLike (10)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nWayne KarolApr 5Finally, something about disinformation that doesn't just say\n\"That's the wrong way to deal with it\", but provides an idea of what's the\nright way.
