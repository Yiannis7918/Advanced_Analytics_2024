TCLtv+ Studios boasts a global production team that includes\nanimators, VFX experts and AI engineers, customizing the latest AI technology\nand empowering producers, writers, and actors to create premium television\nprograms. The first original production originating from the studio is an AI\ngenerated special, Next Stop Paris. Next Stop Paris is a short romance movie,\nfeaturing professional voice actors and an original script, but brought to\nlife with the latest AI animation technology, a leap forward in romance\nstorytelling. Next Stop Paris will make its debut this summer online and on\nthe TCLtv+ streaming app. Fans can get a sneak peek of the exclusive trailer\nbeginning today. The original AI special was developed in house and written by\nChris Regina, Chief Content Officer and Daniel Smith, Chief Creative Officer.\nBoth executives have a deep background in program development at established\nmedia companies and Hollywood studios. The AI enterprise falls under the\npurview of Haohong Wang, General Manager, TCL Research America. Next Stop\nParis opens with a young woman on a train, who despite being heartbroken that\nher fianc\u00e9 ran off with someone in her wedding party, has decided to go to her\nParis honeymoon destination solo. While on board she meets a mysterious\nstranger, and their love story blossoms as they explore \"the city of lights\"\ntogether. The special is animated by a global team including artists from the\nUS, Canada, UK, and Poland, and are pushing creative and enhanced storytelling\nby layering tech and high-quality design animation over traditional narrative.\nTCLtv+ Studios is creating custom AI models and employing the latest\ntechnology including Stable Diffusion and others in this early exploration.\nTCL is well positioned to take advantage of this cutting edge technology and\nis exploring content development in all formats with several series and\nspecials in the development pipeline. That development includes AI and more\ntraditional scripted and unscripted projects. Collaborations on future\nprojects will expand beyond the TCLtv+ Studios teams and will include guild\nwriters and actors as well as key Hollywood talent. Next Stop Paris is an\nearly experiment bringing tech and creative together in a hybrid entertainment\nformat. The AI technology used to create these characters and fictional world\nallows the creative teams to push boundaries and invigorate the viewer\nexperience, while also creating new opportunities for marketing partners. The\npush into originals helps drive a market advantage in a noisy environment\nfilled with content options, and the IP has many applications across the\nplatform from interactive components to sponsorable elements and more. \u201cTCL is\nleading the future of television that will make watching content on TCLtv+ a\ndeeper, more dimensional experience, bridging the gap between rapidly changing\ntech to enhance storytelling,\u201d said Haohong Wang, General Manager, TCL\nResearch America.\u201c The launch of the TCLtv+ Studio solidifies our commitment\nand investment in original production, providing an opportunity for\nexploration in genre bending formats that will help differentiate ourselves in\na busy landscape.\u201d \u201cStory will be at the heart of everything we do, said Chris\nRegina, Chief Content Officer, TCL. \u201cWe are empowering creators and\nstorytellers to use this new technology so the human experience is enriched,\nand we believe that Creatives with limitless imagination will drive endless\ninnovation. We view \u2018Next Stop Paris\u2019 as an early experiment and we\u2019re excited\nto see how it\u2019s received in the town square.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve brought together a best-\nin-class global workforce who value the collaboration for more unique\nperspectives and diversity in the development space. We couldn\u2019t be more\nexcited about the future potential of this creative endeavor,\u201d added Daniel\nSmith, Chief Creative Officer, TCL. TCLtv+ works in coordination with an\nexpanding list of valued partners who are also innovating in technology. The\nrapidly growing streaming service is embracing original content in complement\nto the hundreds of FAST and AVOD channels being launched every month on the\nstreaming platform. Recent partnership deals include the addition of FOX, A&E\nand the NFL.\n\nShow less Show more\n\nTranscript\n\nFollow along using the transcript.\n\n### TCLtvplus\n\n106 subscribers\n\nVideos\n\nAbout\n\nVideos\n\nAbout\n\n## Transcript\n\nNaN / NaN\n\n# Next Stop Paris Trailer Digital\n\nTCLtvplus\n\nTCLtvplus\n\n106 subscribers\n\n<__slot-el>\n\n<__slot-el>\n\nDownload\n\n122K views 6 days ago\n\n122,590 views \u2022 Apr 12, 2024\n\nShow less\n\nTCLtv+ ANNOUNCES LAUNCH OF NEW PRODUCTION STUDIO ENTERS INTO ORIGINAL\nPRODUCTION WITH NEXT STOP PARIS AI SPECIAL MARKS THE FIRST AI PRODUCTION OUPUT\nFROM TCLtv+ STUDIOS ......more\n\n...more\n\nTranscript\n\nFollow along using the transcript.\n\n### TCLtvplus\n\n106 subscribers\n\nVideos\n\nAbout\n\nVideos\n\nAbout\n\nShow less\n\n# Next Stop Paris Trailer Digital\n\n122,590 views122K views\n\nApr 12, 2024\n\nDownload\n\n12:15\n\n12:15\n\nNow playing\n\n### Trump Falls Asleep During First Day of Criminal Trial & Delivers\nNonsensical Gettysburg Rant\n\nJimmy Kimmel Live\n\nJimmy Kimmel Live\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n2.4M views 2 days ago\n\nNew\n\n15:17\n\n15:17\n\nNow playing\n\n### Trump STILL Mad About Oscars Joke & Thinks Jimmy Kimmel is Al Pacino in\nNew Unhinged Post\n\nJimmy Kimmel Live\n\nJimmy Kimmel Live\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n1.4M views 12 hours ago\n\nNew\n\n3:03\n\n3:03\n\nNow playing\n\n### Transformers One - Official Trailer (2024) Chris Hemsworth, Brian Tyree\nHenry, Scarlett Johansson\n\nIGN\n\nIGN\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n122K views 2 hours ago\n\nNew\n\n2:50\n\n2:50\n\nNow playing\n\n### Trap Trailer #1 (2024)\n\nRotten Tomatoes Trailers\n\nRotten Tomatoes Trailers\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n2.6K views 21 minutes ago\n\nNew\n\n0:28\n\n0:28\n\nNow playing\n\n### BELLWRIGHT RELEASE DATE ANNOUNCEMENT\n\nBellwright\n\nBellwright\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n17K views 7 days ago\n\n12:38\n\n12:38\n\nNow playing\n\n### Inside Emma Roberts\u2019s Charming Los Angeles Home | Open Door | Architectural Digest\n\nArchitectural Digest\n\nArchitectural Digest\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n627K views 2 days ago\n\nNew\n\n### Transformers One | Official Trailer (2024) - Chris Hemsworth, Brian Tyree Henry, Scarlett Johansson\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nParamount Pictures\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n413K views 2 hours ago\n\nNew\n\n### Nick Offerman on What He\u2019d Be Like as President, Getting Arrested By\nAccident & New Movie Civil War\n\nJimmy Kimmel Live\n\nJimmy Kimmel Live\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n313K views 1 day ago\n\nNew\n\n### Seeking 12 Impartial New Yorkers | Trump Asks For Wednesdays Off | A Tiny MAGA Mob Assembles\n\nThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert\n\nThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n1.6M views 1 day ago\n\nNew\n\n### Seth Meyers on Trump\u2019s Trial, Strike Force Five Podcast & Andy Samberg\nCrashes His Interview\n\nJimmy Kimmel Live\n\nJimmy Kimmel Live\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n916K views 2 days ago\n\nNew\n\n### Fun Tax Write-Offs | Trump Falls Asleep In Court | Billy Joel\u2019s CBS Concert Cutoff\n\nThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert\n\nThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n2M views 2 days ago\n\nNew\n\n### \u201cSomething Bad Is Happening In Our Country And You Can Make It Right\u201d -\nDoris Kearns Goodwin\n\nThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert\n\nThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n56K views 9 hours ago\n\nNew\n\n### TCL TV Plus\n\nTCLtvplus\n\nTCLtvplus\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n905 views 6 days ago\n\nNew\n\n### DJI Avata 2: Everything you need to know\n\nThe Verge\n\nThe Verge\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n45K views 5 days ago\n\nNew\n\n### PLAYOFF PREDICTIONS + 'Draymond is the CAUSE & CURE!' \ud83d\ude33 Will Warriors BREAK UP BIG 3? | Get Up\n\nESPN\n\nESPN\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n42K views 3 hours ago\n\nNew\n\n### Meanwhile...
