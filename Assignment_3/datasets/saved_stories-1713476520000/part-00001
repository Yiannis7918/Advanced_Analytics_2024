To succeed with that defense, the companies will presumably\nbe compelled to prove, in court, who carried out those attacks.\n\nBritish insurers are arguing that they have no obligation to honor their\ncoverage of the Nord Stream pipelines, which were blown up in September 2022,\nbecause the unprecedented act of industrial sabotage was likely carried out by\na national government.\n\nThe insurers\u2019 filing contradicts reports the Washington Post and other legacy\nmedia publications asserting that a private Ukrainian team was responsible for\nthe massive act of industrial sabotage.\n\nA legal brief filed on behalf of UK-based firms Lloyd\u2019s Insurance Company and\nArch Insurance states that the \u201cdefendants will rely on, inter alia, the fact\nthat the explosion Damage could only have (or, at least, was more likely than\nnot to have) been inflicted by or under the order of a government.\u201d\n\nAs a result, they argue, \u201cthe Explosion Damage was \u201cdirectly or indirectly\noccasioned by, happening through, or in consequence of\u201d the conflict between\nRussia and Ukraine\u201d and falls under an exclusion relating to military\nconflicts.\n\n> BREAKING: The \"defense\" of Nord Stream AG's insurance companies has been\n> filed.\n>\n> LLoyds and Arch argue that the damage was inflicted by, or under order of, a\n> GOVERNMENT , and therefore they don't need pay. \u2013>\n> pic.twitter.com/Unyh6Dtqqa\n>\n> \u2014 Erik Andersson (@Erkperk) April 16, 2024\n\nThe brief comes a month after Switzerland-based Nord Stream AG filed a lawsuit\nagainst the insurers for their refusal to compensate the company. Nord Stream,\nwhich estimated the cost incurred by the attack at between \u20ac1.2 billion and\n\u20ac1.35 billion, is seeking to recoup over \u20ac400 million in damages.\n\nSwedish engineer Erik Andersson, who led the first private investigative\nexpedition to the blast sites of the Nord Stream pipelines, describes the\ninsurers\u2019 legal strategy as a desperate attempt to find an excuse to avoid\nhonoring their indemnity obligations.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s an act of war and ordered by a government, that\u2019s the only way they\ncan escape their responsibility to pay,\u201d Andersson told The Grayzone.\n\nFollowing a report by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Seymour Hersh which\nalleged that the US government was responsible for the Nord Stream explosion,\nWestern governments quickly spun out a narrative placing blame on a team of\nrogue Ukrainian operatives. Given the lack of conclusive evidence, however,\nproving that the explosions were \u201cinflicted by or under the order of a\ngovernment\u201d would be a major challenge for defense lawyers.\n\nEven if the plaintiffs in the case are able to wrest back the funds in court,\nthey are likely to face other serious hurdles. Later in the brief, lawyers for\nLloyd\u2019s and Arch suggest that even if they were required to pay up, anti-\nRussian sanctions would leave their hands tied.\n\n\u201cIn the event that the Defendants are found to be liable to pay an indemnity\nand/or damages to the Claimant,\u201d the brief states, \u201cthe Defendants reserve\ntheir position as to whether any such payment would be prohibited by any\napplicable economic sanctions that may be in force at the time any such\npayment is required to be made.\u201d\n\nAfter they were threatened with sanctions by the US government, in 2021\nLloyd\u2019s and Arch both withdrew from their agreement to cover damages to the\nsecond of the pipelines, Nord Stream 2. But though they remain on the hook for\ndamages to the first line, the language used by the insurers\u2019 lawyers seems to\nbe alluding to a possible future sanctions package that would release them\nfrom their financial obligations. \u201cNord Stream 1 was not affected by those\nsanctions, but apparently sanctions might work retroactively to the benefit of\ninsurers,\u201d observes Andersson.\n\nThe plaintiffs may face an uphill battle at the British High Court in London,\nthe city where Lloyd\u2019s has been headquartered since its creation in 1689. As\nformer State Department cybersecurity official Mike Benz observed, \u201cLloyd\u2019s of\nLondon is the prize of the London banking establishment,\u201d and \u201cLondon is the\ndriving force behind the transatlantic side of the Blob\u2019s \u201cSeize Eurasia\u201d\ndesigns on Russia.\u201d\n\n> Incredible. Lloyd's of London is the prize of the London banking\n> establishment. London is the driving force behind the transatlantic side of\n> the Blob's \"Seize Eurasia\" designs on Russia. If anyone were in position to\n> know the role of \"a government\" in Nordstream bombing...\n> https://t.co/Tui4TwffGM\n>\n> \u2014 Mike Benz (@MikeBenzCyber) April 16, 2024\n\nBut if their arguments are enough to convince a court in London, a decision in\nfavor of the insurers would likely be a double-edged sword. Following Lloyd\u2019s\nsubmission to US sanctions and its refusal to insure ships carrying Iranian\noil, Western insurance underwriters (like their colleagues in the banking\nsector) are increasingly in danger of losing their global reputation for\nrelative independence from the state. Should the West ultimately lose its grip\non the global insurance market \u2014 or its reputation as a safe haven for foreign\nassets \u2014 \u20ac400 million will be unlikely to buy it back.\n\nBritish politicslawfareNord Stream attacksRussia-Ukraine war\n\nWyatt Reed\n\nWyatt Reed is the managing editor of The Grayzone.
