laying off employees\nafter the exit of its controversial former CEO Emad Mostaque.\n\nStability, which is behind the popular Stable Diffusion text-to-image model,\nmade more than 20 of its employees redundant to \u201cright-size\u201d the business\nafter a period of unsustainable growth, according to an internal memo obtained\nby CNBC.\n\nThe company\u2019s newly appointed co-CEOs Shan Shan Wong and Christian Laforte\ntold employees in an email Wednesday night that the firm needed to\n\u201crestructure parts of the business, which will sadly mean saying goodbye to\nsome colleagues.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose who are affected by this have been notified individually and we will be\nsupporting them throughout this period,\u201d Wong and Laforte, who were previously\nchief operating officer and chief technology officer at the company,\nrespectively, said in the internal memo.\n\nStability AI\u2019s layoffs amount to about 10% of its global headcount, according\nto publicly available data online which shows the firm employs around 200\npeople in total.\n\nThe employees affected by the measures are mostly on the operational side of\nthe business and have been notified of their redundancies, according to a\nperson familiar with the matter who spoke with CNBC under condition of\nanonymity as they were not able to speak publicly on the matter.\n\nLast month, Stability announced its former CEO, Mostaque, was leaving the\ncompany to \u201cpursue decentralized AI,\u201d and would be replaced by Wong and\nLaforte.\n\nMostaque\u2019s departure follows media reports throwing doubt on his credentials.\n\nA June 2023 Forbes report said that Mostaque misled people including his own\ninvestors about receiving a master\u2019s degree from Oxford University, as well as\nthe nature of a partnership with Amazon which Stability characterized as a\nstrategic deal but was nothing more than a standard cloud computing leasing\ncontract.\n\nMostaque\u2019s response at the time was that several of Forbes\u2019 allegations were\n\u201cfalse accusations and misrepresentations.\u201d He said he didn\u2019t receive his\nOxford University degree because he didn\u2019t attend his graduation ceremony but\nhad arranged to receive his degrees by post.\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO4:1104:11\n\n\u2018Significant\u2019 investment in networks is needed to reap AI benefits: Nokia\n\nSquawk Box Europe\n\nHe also doubled down on the deal with Amazon and it\u2019s cloud computing unit\nAmazon Web Services by describing it as a \u201cstrategic business alliance\u201d that\nsaw AWS build an \u201cincredibly rare dedicated compute cluster\u201d completed to the\nrequirements of Stability.\n\nStability AI is still searching for a permanent CEO to fill the top leadership\nrole. The company said it continues to operate as normal and is still\nreleasing new products, having only recently announced developer APIs, or\napplication programming interfaces, for its Stable Diffusion 3 AI model.\n\nYou can read the full memo from co-CEOs Wong and Christian Laforte below:\n\nDear team,\n\nAs you know, over the past couple of weeks the Leadership team have been\nworking hard on a strategic plan to reduce our cost-base, strengthen support\nwith our investors and partners, and enable our teams to continue developing\nand releasing innovative products.\n\nFollowing a review of the global team, we have determined the need to\nrestructure parts of the business, which will sadly mean saying goodbye to\nsome colleagues. Those who are affected by this have been notified\nindividually and we will be supporting them throughout this period.\n\nThese decisions have not been taken lightly and they are intended to right-\nsize parts of the business and focus our operations, which is critical to\nsetting us on a more sustainable path - and to put us in the best possible\nposition to continue developing cutting-edge models and products. Products\nlike the Stable Diffusion 3 API strengthen our deep-tech leadership and\ndemonstrate our unique, systemic importance to the AI ecosystem.\n\nWe will meet as planned on Thursday for our regular town hall and we encourage\nyou to ask any questions you might have of our Leadership team in the form\nthat will be sent out shortly. In the meantime, please feel free to discuss\nany concerns with your manager.\n\nWe would like to thank everyone for their dedication and contributions. We\nrecognize the challenges we face, but we have a plan in place. Through the\nhard work and commitment of this team, we are making progress every day,\nmoving us steadily in the right direction.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nShan Shan & Christian\n\nTV\n\nFast Money Halftime ReportWATCH LIVEWATCH IN THE APP\n\nUP NEXT | The Exchange 01:00 pm ETListen\n\n  * Subscribe to CNBC PRO\n  * Subscribe to Investing Club\n  * Licensing & Reprints\n  * CNBC Councils\n  * Supply Chain Values\n  * CNBC on Peacock\n  * Join the CNBC Panel\n  * Digital Products\n  * News Releases\n  * Closed Captioning\n  * Corrections\n  * About CNBC\n  * Internships\n  * Site Map\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Careers\n  * Help\n  * Contact\n\n  * #### News Tips\n\nGot a confidential news tip?
