I'm a big fan. Anyway, this guy shows up and says:\nHey, does anyone remember the BBS game my dad wrote? It was called Buccaneer,\nand it was a pirate game you played on BBSes. Dad died six and a half years\nago and I just wonder if anyone heard of his game?\n\nTurns out... people have heard of Buccaneer.\n\nOne person has it running on their board. Another person was able to share the\nZIP file for others to put it on their boards. Oh no! It was software you had\nto buy if you wanted the full version of it. But Dad is gone, and the kiddo\nhas no idea how to open up the software to everyone.\n\nNo problem, someone posted a quick C programme that will generate keys for\nyou. The kid might be crying because now even more people can play his dad\u2019s\ngame.\n\nThere\u2019s some kinda lesson here in abandonware, but also in humanity. This kid\nmay or may not own the copyrights to his dad\u2019s stuff. Who knows? But one thing\nhe certainly doesn\u2019t have is the ability to make it work.\n\nBut because of a few folks on the Internet, running some old software, and\nsomeone who took a few minutes to write a keygen? Well, his dad is still out\nthere somewhere, and he\u2019s playing pirates.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/bbs/comments/1b626zo/curious_if_anyone_remember_my_fathers_door_game/\n\nMar 06, 2024, 03:48 \u00b7 \u00b7 Ivory for Mac \u00b7 1.2K \u00b7 1.8K\n\nThe Doctor@drwho\n\nEN\n\n@CyberpunkLibrarian He is now part of the GNU clacks overhead of my site.\n\nMar 8\n\nExplore\n\nLogin to follow profiles or hashtags, favorite, share and reply to posts.
