When asked, usually they express their relationship with poetry\nin adversarial terms \u2013 the poem as a challenge or riddle, a code to be broken,\nor a puzzle to solve. This is frequently coupled with a sense that once\nsolved, the poem will reveal itself to be a window into something obscure or\nintensely personal, with very little connection to the reader. I try to\naddress this when I can, championing the work of new and established poets\nwhose poetry tackles a wide variety of topics and concerns that are clearly\nlinked to the present culture and time, and do so in ways that are wonderfully\nunexpectedly accessible. Rather than confirm old stereotypes of poetry as\nromantic, nostalgic, and/or pastoral in its orientation, I find myself\nrecommending the work of poets I\u2019ve encountered who have written in compelling\nways about professional wrestling, video games, tv shows, transnational\nadoption, carnivals, mixed race identity, haunted houses, gun violence,\nimmigration, the history of various technologies, and a host of other\nfascinating topics and experiences. While I can\u2019t guarantee that each person\nwill connect with the poets and poems I recommend, I do think it\u2019s vital that\nwe do our part to expand the public understanding of what poetry is and what\nit can tackle.\n\nIn classrooms and workshops, I find that some poets believe that witty\nwordplay and obscure diction are sufficient to make something poetry. For them\npoetry is an exercise in cleverness, a performance of their own genius. It can\nbe hard work to disabuse them of this notion\u2014to get them to imagine the poem\nas a spiral outward into possibility, rather than a spiral inward into\nunchecked navel-gazing and self-analysis. I think it\u2019s important to do this\nwork\u2014to encourage young poets to let go of the need for a fixed, predetermined\nend and imagine something more wild, more unbounded.\n\nOn poetry\n\nAs I get older, I find myself increasingly drawn to the notion that poetry is\ndefined not so much by what it is, as by what it does. That is to say, rather\nthan offer a list of figures, tropes, and other surface level features which\nmay or may not be present, I prefer thinking of poetry as a sort of magic\u2014a\nrecipe or incantation that evokes or recreates within the reader a particular\nemotional state of wonder, yearning, or sorrow. It\u2019s not just the images or\nwords, but poetry emerges out of their ordering and juxtaposition, the way\neach word assembled together with the next draws on the collective power of\npersonal association and cultural memory.\n\nWhile we often find ourselves in workshop discussing poetry as if it were\nmechanical in nature, I wonder if we\u2019d be better served by reflecting on the\nways a poem is also part organism, part alchemical mixture, and part\ndysfunctional family? To me, poetry is messy business\u2014its language and ideas\nare constantly bleeding into each other, refusing an easy untangling. The\npoems I love are the ones which resemble nothing I\u2019ve seen before, which move\nin strange, unexpected, even audacious ways\u2014forcing me to reconsider my\nassumptions about the world I live in, who I am, and who and what surround me.\nWhen people ask me what I\u2019m looking for in a poetry submission for Boxcar, I\nusually tell them I want work that leaves me gut-punched and reeling, haunted\nfor days by what I\u2019ve read. It\u2019s that type of an encounter, that type of a\nmedium.\n\nAs reader and an editor, I find myself resisting poetry that operates in a\nstate of smugness or turns its eye too self-consciously on its maker and its\nmaking. I prefer poetry that journeys into the dark corners and forgotten\nspaces, not quite certain of what it will find, but moving forward\nnonetheless, every step fraught and perilous, the path ahead new and\nunfamiliar.\n\nOn publishing\n\nFor those familiar with it, Boxcar Poetry Review is known for being the home\nof well-written compelling poems that are unflinching in their tackling of\nhuman experience, as well as a journal that showcases reviews of first books\nand interviews and conversations with first book poets. We\u2019re generally\nregarded as particularly tough place to get published\u2014we place the emphasis on\nthe poems, not on the publishing history or credentials of the poet, and for a\nlong time we were listed in Duotrope\u2019s Top 25 Most Difficult Markets. It\u2019s not\nthat we vie for this particular distinction, but our selectivity is a natural\nproduct of a choice to limit each issue to 10-12 poems, which means I\u2019m\nconstantly saying no to work that might find a home in a journal that\npublishes more poems. As an editor, I\u2019m always trying to winnow my final set\nof poems down to the most exceptional and brilliant, to publish work that\ncan\u2019t be found anywhere else. Given this selectivity and likelihood that we\nturn down other publishable poems for the sake of the final few, we try to be\nfriendly and supportive even in our rejections. I feel there\u2019s really no need\nfor an editor to be unpleasant or dismissive in their correspondence\u2014after\nall, who knows what may show up in a poet\u2019s next submission? Although it\u2019s\nimpossible to respond personally to every submission when I do encounter an\nespecially promising set of poems I try to take the time to comment on the\nstrengths of what I\u2019ve read, indicate the problem points as I perceive them,\nand sometimes offer a possible remedy if the solution seems fairly\nstraightforward. I think this effort to treat each submitter as a fellow poet,\nrather than a client or nuisance to be dealt with, has helped build the\ncommunity around us and earn us a reputation for being a journal worth reading\nand striving for.\n\nOn regret\n\nWith regards to my own work, I have no regret. I have tried to only send out\nthe poems I believed were strong and have avoided sending out work simply for\nthe sake of having something out there. I\u2019ve also been fortunate that when my\njudgment about my own poems has been faulty, other editors have been wise\nenough to say no and save me from myself.\n\nAs the editor of Boxcar, the only thing I regret publishing was a poem that\nturned out to be plagiarized. It was a good poem, deserving of publication\u2014but\nit leaned too heavily on the language, structure, and ideas of another person.\nSomehow it had slipped under the radar and almost two years went by before I\nreceived an email from a reader alerting me to the close similarity between\nthe poem we\u2019d published and one that had been widely anthologized in the\n1980s. I was mortified. I felt embarrassed by my own lack of familiarity with\nthis once well-known poem and betrayed by the submitter who\u2019d broken the\nunwritten contract between submitters and editors to only send original work.\nI ended up taking down the poem and updating the issue online, as well as\ncutting it from the print-on-demand anthology I\u2019d included it in. I wrote a\nstern letter to the poet in question and a very apologetic letter to the\noriginal poet who was still alive. It was a tough lesson. I don\u2019t think you\ncan ever fully guard against plagiarism as an editor\u2013there are just too many\npoems out there and it\u2019s not possible to memorize them all. The best you can\ndo is keep reading and keep trusting that the majority of people sending you\nwork are doing so without any intent to deceive you.\n\n    \n    \n    Neil Aitken is the author of two books of poetry, The Lost Country of Sight (Anhinga 2008), winner the Philip Levine Prize for Poetry, and Babbage's Dream (Sundress 2016).
