But\nthen, how many co-founders do you need?\n\nThere are some famous companies \u2013 like Amazon \u2013 with just one, others \u2013 like\nAirbnb \u2013 with three, and some with even more. We recommend that most people,\nthough, start a company with one other person.\n\nThere are three good reasons not to have too many co-founders: it introduces\ntoo much relationship complexity; it is expensive; and it\u2019s hard to focus.\n\nAt EF, we recommend people build a co-founding team of two. We\u2019ve found teams\nwith three or more co-founders succeed even less often than solo founders. In\nexternal data, two is also the most common number of co-founders for billion\ndollar startups.\n\n### Having too many co-founders introduces too much relationship complexity.\n\nThe number of relationships in a team goes up disproportionately with each\nteam member added.\n\nIn a co-founding team of two, you have one interpersonal dynamic to manage.\nAdding an extra co-founder doesn\u2019t make it 50 per cent but three times more\ncomplex \u2013 there are now three dynamics to manage. At five co-founders, there\nare ten co-founding relationships which need to be built. This is why teams\noften scale less and less efficiently as they grow, and why large co-founding\nteams often have arguments or dysfunctions.\n\nBuilding and maintaining one effective co-founding relationship is hard\nenough. Co-founders are not the same as friendships or colleagues, so even if\nyou got along with your co-founders before, it still takes a lot of time and\neffort to build an effective co-founding relationship.\n\nThe more co-founders you have the more co-founding relationships need to be\nbuilt and maintained. So having lots of co-founders creates a damned if you\ndo, damned if you don\u2019t situation. If you have a lot of co-founders, you\u2019ll\nend up spending lots of your time working on the relationships, instead of\nbuilding the company. If you don\u2019t, the relationships will fall apart. Either\nway, you and your company will suffer.\n\nAt EF, we\u2019ve seen hundreds of founders try to build co-founding teams of three\nor more. Not only do they rarely succeed, unfortunately, the ending is almost\nalways ugly.\n\n### Having too many co-founders is expensive.\n\nYou might think that the more co-founders your startup has, the more skill\nsets your company has available and so the faster it will grow. This isn\u2019t\ntrue.\n\nA co-founder is more than just their raw skills \u2013 they\u2019re someone unwaveringly\ncommitted to your mutual success. So, while the best co-founder will more than\npay for their share by doubling the outcome of your company, they\u2019ll do so\nwith more than their initial skill set. They\u2019ll carry the company when it is\ntoo heavy for you alone.\n\nWe recommend founders get equal shares of the company. But whatever way you do\nit, splitting equity more between more than two co-founders can get expensive.\nSplitting equity three ways instead of two, means two would-be co-founders\ngive up more than thirty percentage points of equity between them, a third of\ntheir equity each. This is a big deal.\n\nEarly employees who receive a salary usually get low single-digit percentages\nof equity. There\u2019s nothing stopping you later hiring a friend you think could\nbe helpful. And almost any skill set can be hired for. So if you\u2019re bringing\non a co-founder to get a specific skill set you could hire with an early\nemployee, it\u2019s not a wise decision. You misunderstand what your co-founder is\npaid for.\n\nAt EF, we\u2019ve seen the best founding teams be ambitious with who they hire as\nearly employees, not with the number of co-founders they pick up.\n\n### Having too many co-founders makes it hard to focus.\n\nThe \u2018co-founder\u2019 title is, practically speaking, the most important title\nwithin a company, at least until it is very successful. Having too many co-\nfounders can paralyse a company, because it\u2019s too hard to reach alignment on\nwhere to focus.\n\nIn the early stages, startups benefit from being incredibly focused, even if\nthe direction they\u2019re taking isn\u2019t quite right. It\u2019s better to pursue idea A\naggressively, then pivot from idea A to idea B, than to kind of work on A and\nB simultaneously. You can\u2019t go in lots of directions slowly, because you\u2019ll be\nbeaten on every front by competitors who are faster.\n\nThe co-founders, therefore, have to be able to reach alignment on the vision\nand direction of the company. They have to focus. Having lots of co-founders\nmakes it harder and slower to do this \u2013 if you\u2019re not trying to reach\nconsensus and alignment, why bother having the extra co-founders at all?\n\nAt EF, we\u2019ve found the best founding teams are aligned and focused throughout\ntheir journey. Over time, we find that co-founding teams of more than two tend\nto end up with at least one of the founders becoming alienated or redundant.\n\n### Pick one.\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to make an exception for yourself. To go it alone or to build a\nthree plus co-founding team. But we think this is rarely the wisest choice.\nSo, when you\u2019re deciding who to start a company with, staring at your list of\npotential co-founders, pick one.\n\n#### More resources\n\n#### Why communication matters for founders.\n\nYour ability to communicate can help or hinder you in every interaction you\nhave.
