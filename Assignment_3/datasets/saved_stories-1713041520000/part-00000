I wanted to discuss the\neffectiveness of homework. If it works well, that would suggest students are\nbottlenecked on examples and repetition. If it works poorly, it would have to\nbe something else.\n\nUnfortunately, all the research on this (showcased in eg Cooper 2006) is\nterrible.\n\nMost studies cited by both sides use \u201ctime spent doing homework\u201d as the\nindependent variable, then correlate it with test scores or grades. If\nstudents who do more time on homework get better test scores, they conclude\nhomework works; otherwise, that it doesn\u2019t.\n\nOne minor complaint about this methodology is that we don\u2019t really know if\nanyone is reporting time spent on homework accurately. Cooper cites some\nstudies showing that student-reported time-spent-on-homework correlates with\ntest scores at a respectable r = 0.25. But in the same sample, parent-reported\ntime-spent-on-homework correlates at close to zero. Cooper speculates that the\nstudents\u2019 estimates are better than the parents\u2019, and I think this makes sense\n- it\u2019s easier to reduce a correlation by adding noise than to increase it -\nbut in the end we don\u2019t know. According to a Washington Post article, students\nin two very similar datasets reported very different amounts of time spent on\nhomework - maybe because of the way they asked the question? I don\u2019t know,\nself-report from schoolchildren seems fraught.\n\nBut this is the least of our problems. This methodology assumes that time\nspent on homework is a safe proxy for amount of homework. It isn\u2019t. Students\nmay spend less time on homework because they\u2019re smart, find it easy, and can\nfinish it very quickly. Or they might spend more time on homework because they\nlove learning and care about the subject matter a lot. Or they might spend\nmore time because they\u2019re second-generation Asian immigrants with taskmaster\nparents who insist on it being perfect. Or they might spend less time because\nthey\u2019re in some kind of horrible living environment not conducive to sitting\nat a desk quietly. All of these make \u201ctime spent doing homework\u201d a poor proxy\nfor \u201camount of homework that teacher assigned\u201d in a way that directly\nconfounds a homework-test scores correlation. Most studies don\u2019t bother to\nadjust for these factors. The ones that do choose a few of them haphazardly,\nmake wild guesses about what model to use, and then come up with basically\nrandom results.\n\nBoth homework proponents (Harris Cooper) and opponents (Alfie Kohn) briefly\nnod to this problem, then take these studies seriously anyway. If you do that,\nyou find that probably homework isn\u2019t helpful in elementary school, but might\nbe helpful during high school (though some people disagree with either half of\nthat statement). But why would you take these seriously?\n\nAre there any real randomized studies? Cooper finds six for his review article\n(page 17), none of which are published or peer-reviewed. Only one is\nrandomized by students, and it contradicts itself about how random it actually\nwas; the other five are cluster-randomized by classroom (which means they have\nvery low effective sample size). Several are bungled in confusing ways. Still,\nthese pretty consistently show a positive effect of homework with medium-to-\nhigh effect size. The one that might have been randomized by students (and so\nmight possibly be okay) had an effect size of 0.39. Some of the cluster\nrandomized ones that weren\u2019t bungled too badly had effect sizes in the 0.9\nrange; the cluster randomization makes it hard to call this significant, but\nunofficially it seems impressive.\n\nSince Cooper wrote his 2006 review, I was able to find one actually good,\nindividually randomized study of homework, Nawaz and Welbourne. They took 368\nstudents taking algebra classes using a digital platform, and randomly\nassigned them either 0%, 50%, 100%, or 150% of the ordinary homework load\n(corresponding to 0, 15, 30, or 45 minutes/night). Results:\n\nThe students with more homework did better, p < 0.0001. Looks solid. Probably\n9th grade algebra homework is useful. But everyone already expected high\nschool homework to be more useful than elementary school, and math homework to\nbe more useful than other subjects. So it\u2019s unclear if eg 4th grade reading\nhomework would follow the same pattern.\n\nStill, this is the one firm fact about homework which we have managed to\nproduce in several million child-years of assigning it. For everything else,\njust go with your priors, I guess.\n\n### Subscribe to Astral Codex Ten\n\nBy Scott Alexander\n\nP(A|B) = [P(A)*P(B|A)]/P(B), all the rest is commentary.\n\n139 Likes\n\n139\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Nobody Knows How Well Homework Works\n\nwww.astralcodexten.com\n\n389\n\nShare\n\nShare this discussion\n\n#### Nobody Knows How Well Homework Works\n\nwww.astralcodexten.com\n\n389 Comments\n\n  * New First\n  * Chronological\n\ndeletedJul 7, 2022\u00b7edited Jul 7, 2022Comment deletedExpand full comment  \n---  \n  \nDavePart-Time FarmerJul 7, 2022\u00b7edited Jul 7, 2022I just have an anecdote from\ndoing this as a TA, not data, but in my experience flipped classrooms work\ngreat for motivated students; they can jump right in to problem sets or\nlabwork, having completed some preliminary reading, and take advantage of\n1-on-1 conversations as needed with the instructor.

I think it has the potential to waste far less class time\nthan typical education. Actually interacting with a teacher when you're\nstruggling beats the heck out of watching them present a set of information.\nBut it suffers HEAVILY from being unconventional. It relies on people to\nactually do their reading/watching ahead of time, and requires people be\nprepared for class. Since that's mostly never necessary in normal classes,\ncompliance tends to be low.My class had a graded pre-class quiz every day to\nhelp force the required transition. Super-easy multiple-choice quiz, just\ntesting that you actually read the assigned text.

I wouldn't say I do a \"flipped\" classroom; I do\nmostly upper-level classes and I'm not teaching lots of brand-new grammar\nmaterial like someone teaching lower-level classes would. But I don't tend to\nassign much homework (apart from AP, where it's basically a necessity to plow\nthrough the syllabus). In class I want my students to read & translate Latin.\nWhat I want students doing away from the classroom is focusing on vocabulary\n(and some of the other basics as well, but mostly vocab). Most of them use\nQuizlet; I don't know if it's the best spaced-repetition software, but it\nseems to have the teen market cornered.I think the ideal way of scaling the\nflipped classroom method is to have people watch something along the lines of\nKhan Academy videos. The teachers I know who have done a lot of flipped-\nclassroom stuff have usually ended up putting in a crazy amount of time\nrecording videos. If you have a huge variety of well-made videos with a good\nteacher, you don't need to do everything yourself.And as has already been\nmentioned, the flipped classroom still requires students to do stuff outside\nof class. If they don't watch the video about how to figure out the equation\nof a circle by completing the square, they're not going to be able to do it in\nclass the next day.As for homework itself, I think it works--sometimes. Its\neffectiveness will vary across different subjects and ages. I wouldn't want to\nbe prevented from assigning it, and I wouldn't want to be forced to assign it\nevery night either.Expand full commentReply (2)Share  \n---  \n  \nViliamKittenlord\u2019s Java Game ExamplesJul 8, 2022> The teachers I know who have\ndone a lot of flipped-classroom stuff have usually ended up putting in a crazy\namount of time recording videos. If you have a huge variety of well-made\nvideos with a good teacher, you don't need to do everything yourself.Some\nteachers in my country produced a lot of YouTube videos as a reaction to\ncovid, during the months when kids stayed at home and learned online. Those\nteachers realized that making a video and then having a Zoom discussion about\nit is more efficient than trying to explain stuff on Zoom. The kids can watch\nthe YouTube videos at a time convenient for them; they can pause them whenever\nneeded; they can watch the videos twice. And if you teach multiple classes,\nyou only need to make the video once. You could even reuse it the next\nyear.What I was thinking someone should do (but I was too lazy to do it\nmyself) is to collect all those videos, group them by topic, and arrange them\naccording to the school curriculum. So you would have a web page where you\ncould click e.g. \"Math, 3rd grade elementary school\", see a list of topics,\nand then a list of YouTube videos for each topic. After two or three teachers\nmade a good video on a topic, you do not need to make your own; so people\nwould only have to make new videos if they believe that there is something\nwrong about the existing ones and they can do a better job.Expand full\ncommentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nJohn N-GJul 9, 2022I do a flipped class where I've made videos for all my\nlectures, with a time investment of about 1 hour for every 5 minutes of\ncontent.

Also, if you get through a homework assignment in half/double\nthe time it takes your peers, you're free to either go do something else or\nput in an extra couple of hours. That doesn't work as well if you're in a\nclassroom and trying to work in parallel with everyone else.Expand full\ncommentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \ndeletedJul 7, 2022\u00b7edited Jul 7, 2022Comment deletedExpand full comment  \n---  \n  \ndeletedJul 7, 2022Comment deletedExpand full comment  \n---  \n  \nIgon ValueJul 7, 2022NAEP data (National Assessment of Educational Progress)\nsuggests that over the past 50 years we've seen no or very little progress for\nwhite males and females, more for Latinos and much more for blacks, especially\nfemales (40% improvement).Expand full commentReply (1)Share  \n---  \n  \nMichael PershanPershmailJul 7, 2022Just FYI there are concerns about how NAEP\nis not dealing with declining high school dropout rates:\nhttps://www.chalkbeat.org/2022/3/31/23005371/high-school-test-scores-\nunderestimate-naep-dropout-ncesExpand full commentReply (1)Share  \n---  \n  \nIgon ValueJul 7, 2022Interesting, thanks.

Tuition at\nRavenscroft (an expensive elite private school with famous powerful alumni) is\nabout $200,000 for a full thirteen year K-12 education for one person. Public\nschool in the same area ends up costing about twice that.From my privileged\nposition as an evaluator/auditor of federal grants, I can say with some\nconfidence that almost all of the added money above 1970 values has been spent\non corruption, usually in the form of the principal hiring his brother-in-law\nto run an afterschool program using GEARUP money, or similar. Very very\noccasionally, we evaluate a program that was actually well-meaning (but which\nstill had purely negative effects). Often these programs are accidentally\nhugely racist or classist. Ask any student what it's like to get referred to a\ndropout prevention program, you'll find that it has horribly negative\nconsequences for their academic career, like a black mark on their permanent\nrecord that makes every future teacher automatically perceive them as a\nfailure who needs compassionate remediation... yet many of the programs are\ndesigned in such a way to 'help' as many minorities as possible by placing\nthem in such programs, even if they are currently a straight-A student who\nhasn't missed a day of school in their entire life and just finished their\napplications to Harvard and MIT.I strongly suspect that if we actually gave\nall the added money to the teachers, it would be enormously good... but the\nway party politics intersects with education policy currently makes this\nimpossible. Instead, every 2 years some bright young congressperson has the\ngreat idea for a new bill to finally fix the problems with education by\nincreasing the annual budget by a few billion dollars, the money gets\nallocated, then the money mysteriously disappears into the black hole of\nbureaucratic corruption and do-nothing NGO nonprofits. Then 2 years later we\nget another pack of naive junior congresspeople and someone has the same\nbright idea all over again.And all the while, teacher pay stagnates.Expand\nfull commentReply (2)Share  \n---  \n  \nJ.

That should\nimmediately raise a bunch of red flags, but it doesn't actually prove that 90%\nof the money is vanishing into NGO pockets as I suggest.I've got a couple of\nevaluation reports I can show you, but they only document problems at\nindividual schoolsEdit: that said, I have tried to point this problem out to\nthe lesswrong / effective altruism / rationalism crowd on many occasions over\nthe last decade. Starting with the first Lesswrong post:\nhttps://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EuMkZ67vDincGSkYp/problems-in-educationPeople\nalmost universally thought I was making bullshit up, so I got my boss to let\nme treat this as a full project, and we got our writer involved, and pulled up\nthe mendeley library with all of our citations, and wrote a real full-on paper\ndescribing what we'd seen:\nhttps://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DxFFeJoczRp2rPS2K/?commentId=oHHRcwxX5HAfcdG9tThe\nfirst post got 300+ comments, the second got seven. Once I could actually\nprove what I was saying, it was a bit like, nobody even knew what the fuck to\ndo, the situation was so much worse than anybody had ever believed before that\nthey just kind of ignored it. It was not a ringing endorsement of less wrong\nrationalism, I'll tell you that.Then about 5 years later I tried with a\ndifferent tack, then maybe if I could get some of this grant money in the\nhands of rationalists it would be better.

I taught at a ~$20k (tuition)/year private school in Florida, which\nofficially spends ~$9k per pupil per year. But that's a combination of\nsecondary school (much more expensive) and elementary (much less expensive)\nwhile we were only high school. Also, that usually only considers the direct\nstate spending, and a lot of things get pushed into other budgets and so don't\ncount (such as capital expenditures, which are a huge chunk of change and had\nto be accounted for in our budget but not in theirs, as they're funded\nseparately largely via bonds). And the variance between locations in each\nstate is huge--florida in 2021 varied between ~7.5k (rural Gadsden county) and\n37.2k (the specialist Florida School of Deaf and Blind). Even without that\noutlier, it was 7.5k - 16k. And that's just operating budget, not capital\nbudget.I think you can make the numbers come out just about any way you want.\nBut what you can't do is obscure the *trend* in spending--that's up. Way way\nup. But mostly for a couple things:1\\. students with special\nneeds/disabilities. When you need a 1:2 (at most) staff:student ratio with a\nbunch of specialists, that gets expensive, fast.2\\. Admin overhead, especially\ncompliance at the district level. This includes useless \"technology\" that\nnever actually makes it down to the classroom level, as well as junkets,\ntrainings, staff, etc.Teachers and classrooms saw very little of this\nballooning spending. And there's effectively 0 correlation between spending\nand outcomes beyond the extremes of the distribution. It's as if there's a\ncertain minimum, below which you get bad results. But above that other factors\ndominate and more spending doesn't change much.What private schools get is\nselectivity--being able to curate the student population.

I've read civil war letters [and we must remember the selection bias\nin which get read- it is mostly a handful of civil war letters that are read\nover and over]. They read like they were written in a particular style. That\nstyle has its charms, certainly, but it in no sense seems to me to be clearly\nsuperior to contemporary style.Consider Sullivan Ballou's letter, which seems\nto be quoted everywhere, and take up 30%> of the mental space people assign to\ncivil war letters:\"As for my little boys, they will grow as I have done, and\nnever know a father's love and care. Little Willie is too young to remember me\nlong, and my blue-eyed Edgar will keep my frolics with him among the dimmest\nmemories of his childhood. Sarah, I have unlimited confidence in your maternal\ncare, and your development of their characters. Tell my two mothers, I call\nGod's blessing upon them. O Sarah, I wait for you there! Come to me, and lead\nthither my children.\"Now I'm not denying it's good, but when we factor in the\nselection bias that goes into bringing it to us, it doesn't seem especially\nremarkable. It's profuse, affectionate, but wordy and melodramatic. I see\nbetter writing than this on Twitter everyday. Not reliably, or in every tweet,\nbut I do see it, perhaps every 50th Tweet.To prove I'm not bluffing about the\nselection bias, here's another civil war letter:My Dear Wife,I now take my pen\nin hand to let you know that I am well and hope these few lines will find you\nthe same. I am well at present. I have got over the neuralgia in the head.We\nhad a great parade on last Thursday, the 19th.

When you look at more homogenous or non-immigrant\nheavy populations in some European countries vs others or the USA with higher\nrates of immigrants etc. you'll find most of your answer there.Education is\ndoing well enough and the rich kids in private schools are doing just as well\nas ever. We are seeing demographics and cultural shifts much more than any\nsweeping changes in education with the main difference being the removal of\nphysical punishment.Certainly not a knock on anyone's intelligence or\ncapability, but an influx of poorer people who are also struggling to learn to\nspeak the language and the culture...they're just not going to do as well on\naverage and it can take 2-3 generations to linguistically and culturally\nacclimatise.This is well known in immigrant families and educational studies.\nIt just takes work, time, and generations even to overcome all the challenges\nfaced by people in those circumstances. I know I'd struggle if I moved to\nFrance and didn't speak French and couldn't' use my education and the people\nthere spat on me and refused to offer me jobs, anyone would struggle and\nthat's what is largely happening in the USA.While if you look at easier\ntransitions such as the kids of an English or Irish medical doctor who moves\nto Canada or something where there isn't a huge transition cost or cultural\nchallenge, then you wouldn't see that effect. While an impoverished person\nfrom Hondouras with no education moving to the USA and working menial\njobs...their kids will struggle more and have less support at home to even\nlearn English, much less do well in school.The broader decline in speech\npatterns, formal speech, etiquette etc. are a separate matter and not part of\nschooling. People used to all wear hats and even poor men would wear a suit of\nsome sort when leaving the house. Is that cultural shift also due to\nschooling? It would be silly to attribute everything to education, especially\nwhen people back in the 1960s received so much less of it with high school\ncompletion rates being lower than today.Expand full commentReply (1)Share  \n---  \n  \nSuzanne SealeJul 7, 2022Parents (probably moms) with more than a couple kids\nor other responsibilities may not have time to help their kids with homework.\nA parent needs to be involved to get the kid started doing his homework and\nmaybe with any tough spots, so finishing is more likely.Expand full\ncommentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \ndeletedJul 7, 2022Comment deletedExpand full comment  \n---  \n  \nDoug S.Jul 7, 2022I've been guilty of spending excessive time on one subject's\nhomework in order to procrastinate on doing a different subject...Expand full\ncommentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nAlexTFishJul 7, 2022I don't quite get the alleged joke.

The benefits I got from anything other than math assignments and French\nassignments in school was probably pretty close to 0.Conversely, going out\nduring summer learning activities on field trips to the local swamp and\nlearning about the local wildlife and plants and animals, I learned a lot,\nbecause it was stuff that was literally in none of my books - they were more\nfocused on macro scale things (evolution) and cool things (tigers, whales,\netc.) than local flora and fauna.If we did more tracking, I suspect people\nwould have more appreciation for homework.That being said, I also suspect that\nelementary school is not very useful in general compared to middle and high\nschool, and that most elementary school teachers are not very good at their\njobs or are following rules that existed since ancient times.You know what was\nuseful?My 2nd grade classroom (in 1992!) had a bunch of computers in it, one\nper student. This was in a public school. We got to mess around on them, play\ngames on them, use them for various minor tasks (I believe we used early word\nprocessors sometimes), etc. I am sure that a lot of kids had never used\ncomputers before then, and they learned the basics of using a desktop computer\nfrom that class.Expand full commentReply (1)Share  \n---  \n  \nRichard GadsdenRichard\u2019s SubstackJul 23, 2022Tracking works best in large\nschools, and primary schools tend to be much smaller because primary-aged kids\nare less independent and can't travel as far as secondary-aged kids. If you\nonly have two classes in a given grade, then you can only split students into\na top 50% and a bottom 50% which isn't all that great for assigning radically\ndifferent school work: both classes will be predominantely students close to\nthe median.You need five tracks just to get a top (and bottom) class that\naverages a full standard deviation from the mean.Expand full commentReply\n(1)Share  \n---  \n  \nTitanium DragonJul 23, 2022\u00b7edited Jul 23, 2022You are making two\nassumptions:1) The student body follows a single bell-shaped curve (which is\noften untrue).2) All classes must be the same size (you can have smaller\nclasses for the gifted and severely disadvantaged students - in fact, most\nclasses for severely disadvantaged students are already smaller by\nnecessity).Also, your math is a bit off.With four classes, even with a\nstandard distribution and identical class sizes of 25 students per class, if\nyou were looking at, say, IQ, you would have two classes in the middle (90-100\nand 100-110) and then two classes for the extremes (110+ and 90-); the median\nin the above and below average courses would be above115 and below 85 (16% of\nthe population is above 115, 16% below 85, so as each class has 25% of your\nstudent body in it, the median would end up around 118 and 82 for the extreme\nclasses, if I am doing my math correctly).You would only need a student body\nof 500 students at a grade 1-5 school to track out the top 25% and bottom 25%.\nIf you assume class sizes of 30, then you still only need 600 students.If you\nwanted to make it so no one in the \"gifted\" class was below 1 SD above\naverage, you'd have to have at least 6 classes, which would be a student body\nof 750 with class size of 25 and 900 for a class size of 30.If you allow the\nclasses to be of different sizes, and maximum class size of 30 and a minimum\nof 16, you can track out all the students 1 SD above average and 1 SD below\naverage with only 100 students per grade level.If you want to track out the 2\nSD students, then you will either have to settle for very small class sizes or\na large population - you'd be getting only 2.5 per 100 students, meaning you'd\nneed 1,000 students per grade level to get 25.On the other hand, when I went\nto elementary school, myself and the other most advanced student were given\nalternative work to do by the teacher while she was teaching the rest of the\nclass lower level math at one school I went to (one of the things I recall is\nthat we got to learn exponents and square roots while the rest of the class\nwas still working on lower level multiplication and division; I recall we also\ngot to do some applied math, which was saving the book club parents time and\neffort but hey), while at another school, there was a small \"TAG\" group which\nhad its own meetings outside of the usual class during normal class times\nwhere we would be taken out during certain subjects and basically learn about\nother things with less supervision.This sort of alternative arrangement is\npossible even without a huge class size.You can also potentially pool the\ngifted students and the disadvantaged students across the school district into\nparticular tracked schools.Disadvantaged students need extra support anyway\nand this is probably more efficient and effective than spreading out these\nresources thinly across a lot of schools; if you put them all in one place,\nyou can have more specialists there.Expand full commentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nPete PDysfunction ChroniclesJul 7, 2022Let's just continue with something of\nunknown utility.

I suspect that, if anything,\nschool is measuring reliability rather than teaching it. Just collect\nattendance and assign homework for a month or two and you'll have enough data\nto make a pretty good estimate of a person's potential as an employee.This\nreminds me of the thought experiment where there's a tradition of people\nhitting themselves on the head with hammers all the time, and coming up with\njustifications after the fact for why that's a good idea, except that in this\ncase we're hitting our children with hammers and saying things like, \"in life\nmost of these kids will lead, they'll bang their heads on things from time to\ntime and it's important that they develop a thick skull early\", or \"of course\nbeing struck repeatedly on the noggin with a wooden mallet isn't an exact\nsimulation of the modern workplace, but the ability to remain stoic and\nfocused in the face of adversity is a trait that is highly valued by\nemployers\".Expand full commentReply (2)Share  \n---  \n  \nGresJul 7, 2022In the current system, lots of people accept that students who\nhave jobs are more reliable than students who aren't. Partly, this is because\nsomeone \"independent of\" the students is vouching for them/prefers to keep\nemploying the student instead of replacing them, partly it's because the\nstudents will probably become responsible if they can attach a time and effort\ncost to money, but also, partly it is because the student can demonstrably\njuggle the commitments of work and study. Therefore, the students get\nadvantages in interviews and such.I suspect that if homework exemptions for\nworking became more common, all of those benefits would be lessened - some\nemployers would pay less and accept a lower quality of worker, if the workers\ngot a separate benefit from the job, and it would take less effort and show\nless responsibility to hold down such a job.

This was partially because I was working slowly and\ncarefully; I rarely made mistakes. But it was also because I knew the general\nidea of the subject matter, and I knew it well enough to rederive it, but I\ndidn't know it so cold that I didn't even need to think about it.

After only one homework\nproblem, yes, I had already demonstrated that I knew the material.

Finally she went to the\nparents and proposed an optional \"homework club,\" and that took care of the\nproblem. (I'll note that I think she is a very good teacher and did not assign\nbusy work for the sake of giving homework, but rather specifically for this\nkind of skill building.)Now -- and maybe this is what you were saying -- this\nisn't true for every student for all levels of math -- which I know because\nthis teacher told me (and was surprised to tell me) that my older child did\n*not* have to do homework because she didn't have this problem with making\nmistakes and being very slow with calculations. Partially though that's\nbecause my older child does a bunch of math contests, so she does the skill-\nbuilding outside of class. My younger child didn't have to do skill-building\nfor elementary 6+2 kinds of problems, because he'd make up his own problems\nand get practice at home, like \"oh, I have 6 toys and now I have two more!\nLet's see how many toys I have now!\" but he does have to do it for, say,\nmultiple-digit addition, where he made a lot of mistakes before he practiced\nthe skill.Expand full commentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nbell_of_a_towerJul 7, 2022This is something actually in my area of expertise\n(I taught physical sciences at a relatively pricey private high school for 7\nyears). Math homework and drilling lots and lots of practice problems was\nactually crucial for everyone. Because by the time they got to chemistry or\nphysics (even the baby intro versions that were all that were required), those\nwho didn't have that automatic \"muscle memory\" were lost as soon as a number\nwent up on the board/paper. Yes, they could eventually figure it out, but\nspending 2-3 minutes (no exaggeration) doing a simple \"convert 1 m to mm\"\nproblem and not having any mathematical intuition when they'd plug it into a\ncalculator and get something bizarre (because they put in garbage) meant that\nthey'd mostly just get lost.Drill-to-perfection is critical especially for\narithmetic and basic skills. No, common core, it doesn't really matter if you\nknow why 2 + 2 = 4 (which isn't actually something they teach anyway) or have\n27 different ways of doing that operation. What matters is that you don't have\nto think about it--you see basic operations such as shifting a decimal place\nand it just happens transparently in your head with no mental overhead. So you\ncan get on and do the real interesting part. And that only happens by\nrepeated, frequent practice until it's not even a conscious process\nanymore.And I saw it with my own physics homework--there was a literal \"ah ha\"\nmoment when someone had practiced enough variations of the same problem. The\nlight came on and then that kind of problem was easy from then on. And it\ngenerally took quite a few repetitions and almost-identical-but-not-quite\nvariations. It was a phase transition between \"this is impossible\" (in teen-\nspeak meaning \"this requires effort\") and \"why was this so hard? This is\ntrivial.\" Different people hit it at different points. But everyone who had\nthe necessary foundation hit it some time.Expand full commentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nProfessorEJul 8, 2022From the point of view of someone who has spent more than\n20 years teaching students unfamiliar concepts, I have to say that this\ncomment strikes me as very, very, strange. The point here is that the claim is\nreally a circular argument. \u201cIf you know how to solve the problem\u201d, has no\nmeaning before having practiced it, does it? How would someone \u201cknow\u201d how to\nsolve it then? Is the implication that the teacher shows students how to solve\nthe problem in class, then the students practice it in class, say, a few\ntimes, and, at that point, they \u201cknow\u201d how to solve the problem, and therefore\nall future practice is irrelevant? What school, class, curriculum, activity or\nskill does that resemble that exists in the real world? I can think of no non-\ntrivial skill for which that is true. Nothing, from woodworking to math,\nvocabulary, learning a foreign language, etc. for which additional practice\noutside of the initial exposure to the concept would be needed before a\nlearner would be able to describe themselves as \u201cknowing\u201d how to solve the\nproblem without substantial practice. My son is quite gifted in math, and I\nteach honors students, and even for those types of students I have not found\nthat I simply demonstrate a concept once and that zero additional practice is\nthen needed. Certainly when kids learn fractions, decimals, complex grammar\nrules, how to craft an essay, etc. I have never observed that a single\nexposure is sufficient.Thus, I agree with you: continuing to drill past the\npoint of mastery is not good. But the only route to mastery is practice.\nTheory is that HW is an opportunity for practice. The counter argument is that\nmany students do not do their HW, the parents do it, they don\u2019t use it for\npractice because they do only a perfunctory job on it, etc. None of that\nchanges the point, which is that the sine qua non of developing skill and\nexpertise in a given subject still requires additional practice, and the\nmusician analogy is pretty good.By the way, there are numerous good papers in\nthe literature on the development of expertise on how differently experts and\nnovices look at problems, and just how much can be gained by additional\nreinforcement / development of expertise through practice.

Or it\u2019s something like reading, which is just a matter of\npractice but which lots of students don\u2019t do for fun, so they benefit from\nsomeone sitting there and watching them do it. It\u2019s not all students and all\nsubjects, but if you start in primary school it\u2019s a lot of students.And yes,\nin maths at least, basically everything builds on something else, so there\u2019s a\nlot of overlap between questions on successive days.Expand full commentReply\n(1)Share  \n---  \n  \nEducation RealistEducation Realist: no more dewe...Jul 10, 2022\"Have you ever\ntried to explain something to a child trying to do homework, in a one-on-one\nsetting?\"I spent 6 years as a tutor and test prep instructor and I've been a\nteacher in three subjects for 13 years so um, yeah.

Most tutoring and time spent with a tutor is\nessentially 'doing homework' and/or working through sets of problems.\nEspecially if one were to look at tutoring centres vs scores...this could be a\ngood approximation of how much 'practice makes perfect'. Though you'd be hard\npressed to not be swamped with bias fo who goes to tutoring. But with a bit of\nhand waving statistics one could compare similar SES kids who get tutoring vs\nthose who don't to see if practices helps.Another way, which I'm surprised to\nsee is missing, is to look at homework completion rates and scores. Few\nteachers bother to do this consistently, but there are some who collect and\nmark all homework as part of a homework score. This happens a lot more in\nMaths or Science classes than in something like english or history but can be\nfound all over if homework is a formal part of their summative grade.I found\nit was a good opener and I'd have a 'do now' problem at the start of class\nand/or I'd have them do a quick peer marking to swap their homework and mark\neach other based on answers I'd put on the board (with some QC from me). Then\nI'd collect that to have them do the marking for me and get the valuable\nexperience of engaging in marking. This sort of actual homework submission is\na decent proxy for 'practice' and better than time spent. If a kid spends 5\nminutes per problem or 1 minute per problem because they are smarter/already\nknow it etc. who cares? The main thing is the number of practice problems they\ncompleted, in my view.And they would be a good method to compare if completing\nx% of practice sets with x% accuracy helps or not using their marked homework\nsubmissions. So yea I'd think to look at homework completion rates of a given\nband of high/middle/low achievers and their homework completion rates to show\neffort and the scores they get in that homework to show mastery.e.g. If two\nstudents gets a 60/100 on their prelim test at the start of the school year,\nthen one does 80% of their homework with 90% accuracy and the other does only\n20% of their homework with 90% accuracy....what will their final exam results\nbe? Will that extra practice by the 80% homework effort kid result in a higher\nscore than the other kid who clearly didn't practice as much?Time spent is\nalways going to be fraught with incredible inaccuracies akin to people self\nreporting their dietary/caloric intakes...only worse since it relies on\nchildren to report timespans.Expand full commentReply (2)Share  \n---  \n  \nCups and MugsJul 7, 2022Another point too...longer school days....what do\nstudents do with longer school days?

But if teachers don\u2019t check\nthat kids understood the problems they do in class, that also works worse. If\nthey don\u2019t check that kids understood the explanations, that also works worse.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean \u201cteachers are useless\u201d, it just means these particular\nteachers are crappy.If kids won\u2019t admit they couldn\u2019t do some part of the\nhomework, they also won\u2019t admit they didn\u2019t understand the explanation in\nclass, or in the book, or whatever.

To handle that, teachers can assign higher quality\nassignments that won\u2019t trigger negative interactions. Sounds tough, but OK.For\nadolescents, classes that assign homework frequently are associated with more\nlearning. But not classes that ask for more time on homework. And not classes\nthat assign more homework that students think is more challenging. But yes\nclasses where students think the homework is interesting or well-selected. And\nstudents reporting they put more effort into homework is associated with\nlearning.It sounds like teachers need to thread the needle for teens. They\nneed to frequently assign homework that is purposeful \u2013 it can\u2019t be busy work\n\u2013 but it shouldn\u2019t be too hard.

But when you're dealing\nwith adolescents, realistically there are a lot of ways for them to get away\nwith not actually doing it. (A lot.) Completion rates in most places aren't\nterrific.

You are introduced to a concept like\n\"multiplication\" or \"sine function\" or \"Lebesgue integration\" and then you\nwork through a zillion examples until it's been thoroughly beaten into your\nhead; you reach the plateau where you finally understand what a sine function\nis. Then you can move on to the next bit of mathematics, which assumes you\nunderstand the previous bit.Unfortunately the number of examples you're\nobliged to work through is some constant, insufficient for the dumb kids and\nexcessive for the smart kids. So the smart kids are bored doing the same thing\nover and over again while the dumb kids never quite reach the plateau and get\nleft behind.Some other subjects are unlike this. You don't need to understand\nthe history of Ancient Greece before you can understand the history of Ancient\nRome. Furthermore, while you can reach the \"sine function\" plateau pretty\neasily, no high school student will reach the \"Ancient Greek History\" plateau.\nSo you can spend an unlimited number of hours studying ancient history, if you\nlike, understanding it more and more deeply, although possibly not in any way\nthat can show up on a high school exam.Expand full commentReply (1)Share  \n---  \n  \nKennyJul 8, 2022As (somewhat of) a 'mathematician', I am very confident in\nasserting that almost no one, even theoretical physicists, 'understands'\nmathematics anyways!And I'm somewhat 'pissed' that 'school' almost ruined\nhistory for me.

This has been\ntrue for my entire life - I remember independent learning assignments as early\nas first or second grade, and I've always found them more useful than lecture-\nbased instruction. My capacity for self-teaching has improved since I was six,\nand I can go longer without support/feedback now, but the basic principle is\nstill the same. This is probably less useful if you have unmedicated ADHD or\notehrwise aren't much of an independent learner.(Unfortunately, type 2\nhomework tends to correlate with useless busywork during class time. The most\nnotable example I've run into was high school AP bio, which was a \"flipped\nclass\". 100% of my time outside of class - mostly reading the textbook - was\nuseful; 90% of my time in class was spent doing repetitive worksheets or\nlistening to the teacher repeat the textbook in smaller words. Then again, I\nprobably only did 30% of the assigned homework. It was a weird year.)I guess\nthere's a third category, which is homework with the goal of improving\nfluency/speed at some task. Teachers love to give this kind of homework, but\nthey're often remarkably bad at designing it. IMO, this sort of homework\nshould include lots of very short problems, instant feedback, and enough\nsurprises that making an excel spreadsheet/python program that solves the\nproblem for you is more time and effort than doing it by hand. Also, my\nexperience this literally only works for symbol manipulation problems (eg the\nkind of math that engineers do/basic proofs/sudoku).

The way they did this was very simple and cheap\nto code: they would write three word problems for each topic with slots for\nquantities (eg if X moles of gas is heated from Y to Z degrees celsius, what\nis the percent change in volume?), then generate random numbers to fill in\nthose slots. They would then serve you these questions multiple times until\nyou got approximately five in a row correct. They would then assess your\nunderstanding of the topic... by giving you the exact same questions again\nwith different random numbers.As a student, this system is very clearly not\nincentivizing you to understand the ideal gas law. It does not care whether\nyou understand the ideal gas law. All ALEKS wants is for you to come up with\nthe right number by applying the exact same steps to the exact same problem\nevery time.So yes, at the end of the class I learned something, and I probably\nlearned it better than most of my peers. But the thing I learned was not the\nideal gas law, and it was not \"how to solve problems\", and it definitely\nwasn't how to understand the principles of chemistry, it was \"how to make\nALEKS think I know things as fast as possible so it will go away\".Moving back\nto the way this can make it harder for smart students to succeed, type 1\nhomework occurs when a teacher first decides what's going to be on the test,\nthen tries to teach students how to take that test. It's the equivalent of a\nmusic teacher deciding that they're going to test their students' performance\nof a sonata by having them play one scale, then asking them to drill just that\nscale over and over. By the end of the class the students are probably really\ngood at that scale, and sometimes that's genuinely useful, but it's doing them\na disservice to then walk out and claim that students who got a 4.0 in\n\"playing D major\" are actually playing a sonata.And say you're a college\nadmissions officer or scholarship application reviewer for a music program.\nYou get to look at students' grades, but you don't get to listen to them\nactually play music. If there's a lot of type 1 homework going into those\ngrades, you have a problem - you don't know which students got good grades\nbecause they're good at music and also drilled in scales, and which ones only\ndrilled in scales. The problem isn't that the best musicians are pushed out of\nthe top, it's that your test no longer has the *sensitivity* to distinguish\nthem from the people who are only good at drills.Expand full commentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nheronJul 7, 2022Agreed: the horror of guessing the 'agreed' answers in GCSE\nand A'level English exams in the UK.

I continued on this route in high\nschool and while I maintained top grades in some subjects, my grades in\nmathematics, physics and chemistry tanked (more specifically, calculus was my\nbreaking point and upon being introduced to the topic, I received a failed\ngrade), and I dropped out of school. I've since continued studying in\nuniversity and I'm receiving good grades, but this time I'm doing the bare\nminimum and subjectively, I would expect to fail most courses if I didn't do\nthat much.What I gather from my experience is the following: Homework is\nuseful, but only up to a point dependent on the individual and the topic. For\nme, at least as far as the granularity of school grading system goes, there\nwas no use up until high school, but at high school level failure to do any\nwork was sufficient to drop the math grades from excellent to failed.\nPresumably, other students might find homework to be the difference between\nsuccess and failure at an earlier or later stage than I did. But perhaps more\ncrucially, it has the additional effect of building up work ethic: to this day\nI find myself unable to cope with a workload of doing more than half of the\nnumber of courses expected of students, and I can only assume this is because\nI never did any work prior to university. This alone seems like a good\njustification to have mandatory homework, although it would be better still if\nhomework wasn't seen by some students as arbitrary punishments handed out in\nchild prisons, but gifted students could skip grades to the point where doing\nhomework is actually required of them.Expand full commentReply (1)Share  \n---  \n  \nThor OdinsonJul 7, 2022\u00b7edited Jul 7, 2022As an addendum anecdote: for me, in\nmaths and physics, the point at which merely turning up stopped being\nsufficient and homework beyond the assessed assignments became necessary was\ngrad school.(P.s.

Some of that may be\nmy idiosyncratic personality and \"learning style\", some may be my school, but\n*I* would be very reluctant to throw out homework until I'm presented with\nwhat looks (to me) like a better alternative.Certainly some (not all, not\nmost, but some) of that homework was a waste of time insofar as I learned\nthings I didn't much care about at the time and have forgotten. But that's a\ndifferent claim from the efficacy of homework; and I'm not sure how we resolve\nit given that kids (even at college age!) often are really not sure what they\nwill ultimately find interesting and helpful (let alone secondary social goals\nlike insisting on the teaching of the \"second\" language in a bilingual\nsociety).Expand full commentReply (1)Share  \n---  \n  \nMaynard HandleyJul 7, 2022To add to what I said, in addition to the \"do\ndifferent people learn differently\" axis, there is also the \"different\nsubjects\" axis.I think few (especially serious practitioners) would deny that\nyou learn math, physics and programming by doing. Lectures are helpful,\nreading is helpful, but nothing can replace doing in the sense of one damn\nproblem after another.I think most people who have studied a second language\nwould say the same thing.Writers seems to say the same thing, that you learn\nwriting BY writing, not by reading, not matter how much you enjoy that.So\nultimately what's left?Are we arguing that homework for history (which, at\nleast in my case, was mainly writing essays) is a waste of time that does not\nhelp you learn or think about the material? Seems a stretch.Or are we arguing\nfor more choice over what subjects fourteen year olds should study? Maybe so,\nmaybe not, but that's a different argument.Or are we arguing for no homework\nuntil 14, with the expectation that kids who have never done this before (and\nbased on claims that it's not useful for 8 yr olds) will now easily adapt to\nthe rigors and demands of homework? Sounds like crazy talk to me.It's one\nthing to argue that we have too much credentialization and \"book-learning\"\nforced on much of the population for whom it's inappropriate. I'd agree with\nthat. But(a) I think everything about homework, both the content and the self-\ndiscipline, are required for those who do want to go into\nacademic/professional type jobs and(b) deciding at a young age who should go\ndown which path is hardly trivial. Again, regardless of whether it was, in\nsome sense, optimal, this has been derided in so many countries, whether the\ncutoff primarily affected a particular ethnicity (eg Australia or Native\nAmericans) or a particular class (eg UK Tripartite system\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripartite_System_of_education_in_England,_Wales_and_Northern_Ireland\n).Realistically, I don't give a damn how you structure it in terms of color-\nblind race-blind gender-blind income-blind testing at various ages, different\ngroups will be routed to the different streams, this will be considered\nunacceptable, and the fighting over it will never end. Which is exactly why we\nare where we are today, with the default assumption being that every kid has\nthe potential to become a professional, and as such needs the training and\nself-discipline required from an early age to develop the skills and habits of\nsuch a job/lifestyle.Expand full commentReply (1)Share  \n---  \n  \njumpingjacksplashJul 7, 2022It's also a problem that's a little bit like\nclassical NIMBYism - nobody's happy for *their* kid to be the one labelled as\na janitor aged 11, even if they'd previously have accepted it as a sensible\nsystem.

It's more like\ntraining than education; the point is to develop unconscious competence so\nthat you can just do the task automatically. I've been a great math student,\nbut I tend to do mental arithmetic relatively slowly; I always came up with\ntricks to compensate for a lack of immediate recall, so I never got to the\npoint where I could multiply any two single-digit numbers instantly. For\nexample, if you ask me to multiply 8 by 7, I might not remember immediately\nthat the answer is 56, so I'll remember that 7*7 is 49 and add 7 to that to\nget 56. In second grade I discovered that I could calculate 13 - 7 by\ncalculating 10 - (7 - 3) instead of by knowing that the answer was 6. When\nschool math did become more complicated than arithmetic, being clever with\nnumbers and manipulations was a big help, but at the level in which\nmemorization is the fastest algorithm I didn't quite keep up.Expand full\ncommentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nsourdoughJul 7, 2022Haha I love this post. \"There's 1 fact, and that's the way\nit is.

I think in modern society,\ncomputers/internet/automation have removed a lot of the value in memorization\nand mastery over repetitive tasks. The way I'm able to be a high functioning\nmember of society is specifically by *not* memorizing things (wastes time and\nmental resources) or being good at repetitive tasks and instead I'm good at\nlooking stuff up on the internet and knowing how to ask WolframAlpha good\nquestions.If we want children to be good at taking closed book tests, which is\ncompletely non-analogous to the modern real world, then sure, homework may\nhelp.

How do you get 3 x 4 without having to stop and think? Lots\nand lots of practice. Homework is one way to find extra time outside classroom\nhours to do that practice.A school with no homework but a longer school day\nwould probably do exactly the same, there's no reason why the practice has to\nbe done at home.

(I recognise that sounds like it comes straight from my CV 30+ yrs\nago, oh.) There are many examples of young people's experience akin to\nMichael's in terms of labelling, unhelpful testing and ignoring his actual\npotential when his fundamental needs are outside of formal education.The\ncauses culminating in a failure to meet so many children's basic needs are\nmany. Children do not suffer because there's a dearth of evidence regarding\nbasic prerequisites for a decent life. As for labelling IQ and one's\nabilities, in spite of ubiquitous practices, much is known about individual\nneeds and propensities for learning stuff: maybe context is everything.One\nhigh school I taught at gave me 'the unteachables' as I was the part-time,\nsingle-parent, outsider to the department. My classes were shoved outside of\nthe school building into prefabs.My GCSE pupils failed to reach 'passes'\nacross the board in other exam subject areas but managed to get grades of\n'D'/'C' and even one 'B' in English. (C, B and 'A' being the esteemed\ngrades/acceptable towards further education). Each year the Head Teacher would\nremark that I had 'broken the mould' and I was highly disliked by the Heads of\nDept precisely because - even though a small percentage of the work was\nmoderated in school, around 70% was external examination - my students were\nconsidered the hopeless cases and were out-performing 'more able' students in\ntheir own classes. Also, I am strongly child-centred which is not universally\ntrue of teachers; I can be annoying:)A guy called Ajahn Brahm (Theravada\nBuddhist based in Perth, Aus.) often repeats his tale of organising an\nanonymously marked Math exam in a London high school (he taught for a year and\nthought better of it!), whereupon he 'secretly' [only he and the Head Teacher\nheld the data] streamed the children based on the results of this one\nexamination. Over the course of the school year Brahm/whatever his pre\nBuddhist monk name was, proceeded to give positive attention and praise to the\nstudent who achieved the lowest examination mark. Within one year, this kid\nwho was given attention and support, free from other teacher prejudice (they\nhad not seen last year's results), scored at the top of the class of his\npeers.The above examples sound simplistic, and yet caring about, and holding\nstudents in great esteem, plus appropriate pedagogy, seem to me to be a basis\nfor fostering learning possibilities.

Instead, people\ndiddle with this nonsense as if it matters, and oh, lord, the elementary\nschool parents talking about it! Jesus, people. Homework at that level is\nirrelevant, because nothing in elementary school matters, gradewise.But the\npublic policy issues with homework dwarf the piddling possible improvement it\nmay or may not reveal. Some of you have mentioned this. At the high school\nlevel, the only relevant issue with homework is that it substitutes compliance\nfor ability. It's very common for kids with high abilities to get lower grades\nthan kids with lower abilities (and also similar abilities, which is just as\nidiotic).Grades in America are a fraud, and we are now in a world where these\nfraudulent grades are the only legal tender for college.

If your\nkid doesn't understand classwork, find a shrink to see what LD he or she\nhas.Parents of high school kids: do whatever you can, including bribery, to\nget your kid to do homework. Do not make it a moral issue or a learning issue.\nMake it clear that it's bullshit, asinine hoops they need to jump through to\nkeep their grades up.If, on the other hand, your kid copies homework just to\nget it done, judge them severely and wonder where the hell you went wrong. The\nfirst kid is far superior.On the third hand, if you have a kid who just does\nthe homework even though he or she knows it's bullshit and genuinely enjoys\nticking off tasks, well, they're weird but it makes life easier for you.I\ndon't give homework.

The particular details of when I would or wouldn't do it are\ncomplex.In high school I ended up doing all the assigned math homework anyway,\nand in college I did much less than that. And it seems pretty clear to me that\nthis directly impacted how much material I ended up retaining; the quality of\nmy learning is much lower for the college material.So I would say that yes,\npractice matters in math. On the other hand, I would estimate the amount of\nhomework that's necessary to fully learn and retain \"9th grade algebra\" at\nzero. It's not at all complex and doing work further along in the curriculum\nwill provide more than enough drill in the basics of algebra.[1]Moving back to\nthe topic of the post more generally, I would bring up the result that student\nperformance in math generally tracks \"exposure to math in school\" pretty\nclosely, whereas performance in other subjects (and most notably reading) does\nnot. I find the argument persuasive that this is mostly due to the fact that\nstudents rarely do more math than they are assigned in school, whereas many\nstudents do a lot more reading than they are assigned in school.[1] Another\nthing that seems obvious to me is that different people will require different\namounts of practice to learn and to retain the same material.Expand full\ncommentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nDeiseachJul 7, 2022I think that homework is important, because to me it's\npractice; you wouldn't say to a kid \"did you learn that music\npiece/recipe/sport?\" and have them say \"Oh yeah, we did it in class\" and then\n\"well have you played the piece/cooked the recipe/played the sport?\" \"No need,\nwe did it in class, I remember it!\"We see the value of practicing/trying out\npractical skills, I don't think mental ones are much different. For primary\nschool, leave homework until they're older (7+) and only a little, because at\nthat age it's (a) getting them into the habit of having a routine and doing it\nand (b) physical practice like writing so they get the skills.I don't know how\nmuch homework secondary students get in America (or indeed what it's like in\nmodern Ireland); in my time coming up to the Leaving Certificate (final year\nnational exam for ages 17-18 school leavers) we were recommended by our\nteachers to do an hour per subject study every night. You could be doing 6-8\nsubjects, so I don't know how many people did spend 6-8 hours every night\nstudying. But you do need *some* time studying and not just relying on \"we did\nit in class and I remember it\".I agree that \"amount of time spent on homework\"\ndoes *not* correlate with \"results on tests\" except very crudely; good\nstudents may spend more time on homework because they are studying, and good\nstudents will probably do better on tests. But you have, as pointed out, smart\nstudents who skip or spend little time on homework, who will do well on tests\nanyway, and poor students who spend a lot of time on homework because it's\nhard for them and will do not so well.Expand full commentReply (1)Share  \n---  \n  \nBogdan ButnaruJul 9, 2022\u00b7edited Jul 9, 2022> For primary school, leave\nhomework until they're older (7+)What does \u201cprimary school\u201d mean in Ireland?\nFor us in Romania school started (and AFAIK still does) at 7, *rarely* at 6\nfor children born in the autumn, early after the start of the school year.\nYounger than that we called it... well, not kindergarten because we don\u2019t\nspeak English but that\u2019s what the word means.(Irrelevantly, it\u2019s interesting\nthat our word is etymologically similar.

I think that much of\nthe (very interesting) discussion seems to ignore or downplay comments about\nthe quality of studies in this area. The lack of good studies on HW\nspecifically should motivate us to rely more on theory and on related\nliterature (and improve studies).We have lots of studies that are more theory\ndriven, and we do have first principles. When we ask a question like \u201cis\nhomework effective?\u201d What is the assumption about when students will practice\nthe concepts that they have been exposed to in class, if not via HW? Just\ntheoretically, if we had a complete dataset on the exact amount of time that\nevery student spent doing HW, is anyone hypothesizing that in elementary\nmathematics (say), there is no relationship between the amount of time\nstudents spend practicing a task such as adding fractions with unlike\ndenominators and (a) their accuracy on a test of that material, and (b) their\nfacility / speed given a consistent level of accuracy (i.e., expertise) with\nwhich they would be able to execute concepts such as these? (Controlling for\nother relevant factors such as ability.) In other words, is the conclusion of\nthe \u201canti-HW\u201d/\u201cHW is useless\u201d crowd that, given a perfect dataset with full\ncontrols (or random assignment and perfect measurement in terms of time and\nattention), deliberate practice on tasks like learning times tables, adding\nfractions, working with percentages, word problems, etc. would have *zero\nrelationship* with expertise as measured by tests?!?If that were true, it\nwould be very surprising, to say the least. In laboratory experiments where\npeople are required to learn things, practice (and attention - \u201cdeliberate\npractice\u201d) and time on task are strong predictors of learning. I used\nmathematics as an example, but if the concept were \u201cknowledge of history\u201d, or\n\u201cknowledge of geography\u201d, it does not seem possible that this relationship\nwould be zero. Learning to write well involves writing, then seeing feedback\non that writing (and preferably, a chance to fix whatever errors were made,\nwithout punitive grading), etc. All of these practice opportunities cannot be\nfit into a class day without sacrificing instructional time.What many\ncommenters seem to be getting at is that much elementary school HW is a waste\nof time in comparison to the hypothetical HW that I have postulated (one\nperson mentioned coloring assignments, but there are so many \u201csilly\u201d things,\nmany of which are really \u201cparent assignments\u201d). I do agree with other\ncommenters that some of those comments are too strong, because it implies that\nacademic skills are the only skills that elementary school is cultivating,\nwhich is untrue.As a final point, the academic literature in Education does\nnot tend to be the strongest in terms of statistical or analytical rigor. As\njust one example, the analyses in most of the HW literature fail to account\nfor attenuation of the focal variable due to the (gigantic) measurement error\nwith which HW time is measured (see\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_dilution if this is unfamiliar to\nyou). This is one of many similar issues that plague this kind of work, and\nwhich may or may not be affecting our conclusions.Expand full commentReply\n(2)Share  \n---  \n  \nMichael StrongMichael Strong's Entrepreneuria...Jul 7, 2022Given the high\nlevels of disengagement among secondary schools (Gallup survey cited below\nshows only 1/3 of high school students are engaged), I think of most of\nsecondary school as \"learning theater.\" Thus while I'm certain that deliberate\npractice works, and that students who engage in homework with an intention to\nimprove their skills do improve their skills, most students (if they do\nhomework at all) do it in the most perfunctory manner. They are not trying to\nlearn - they are going through a tedious, meaningless ritual to try to get\ntheir parents and teachers to quit annoying them so they can get on with\nthings they want to do (social media, gaming, watching videos, etc.)For most\nstudents, the goal of school is to learn as little as possible while getting\nadequate grades to satisfy their parents or other goals (e.g. getting bonuses\nfrom their parents, maintaining eligibility for sports, not dropping out,\netc.) School is only valuable for the social life it provides. Classes are an\nboring, annoying time between opportunities to hang out with their friends.\nMaybe a time to catch a nap after having stayed up most of the night\nonline.Gallup:\"Almost half of students who responded to the survey are engaged\nwith school (47%), with approximately one-fourth \"not engaged\" (29%) and the\nremainder \"actively disengaged\" (24%).A closer look at the data by grade level\nreveals a disturbing trend. Engagement is strong at the end of elementary\nschool, with nearly three-quarters of fifth-graders (74%) reporting high\nlevels of engagement. But similar surveys have shown a gradual and steady\ndecline in engagement from fifth grade through about 10th grade, with\napproximately half of students in middle school reporting high levels of\nengagement and about one-third of high school students reporting the\nsame.\"https://www.gallup.com/education/244022/school-engagement-\ntalk.aspxExpand full commentReply (1)Share  \n---  \n  \nProfessorEJul 7, 2022Not going to argue with that. However, (a) we have a\nmoral obligation to provide the opportunity to learn for those who wish to\ntake advantage of it (can lead a horse to water...), (b) it isn\u2019t clear that\nthere are zero returns to what you are describing as \u201cperfunctory\u201d completion\n\u2014 that\u2019s an empirical question, (c) the data you present on engagement runs\ncounter to the data on homework/etc. Based on what you wrote, one would expect\nthat HW would be basically useless as children get older and enter HS, whereas\nthe data show that, if anything, HW becomes more useful as kids get older.I\nthink that the more general point is this: Scott\u2019s post focused on \u201chomework\u201d.\nThe broader point here is that \u201cwell-spent time on task\u201d, meaning some degree\nof attentiveness given to a particular task where it is being practiced, is\nabout the only mechanism we know of by which learning occurs. Yes, smarter\npeople / children will need less time on a given task to pick it up, and prior\nknowledge permits faster integration of cognate knowledge, etc. so individual-\nlevel controls are necessary. Overall practice predicts performance. Longer\nschool days, longer school years, etc. all predict greater achievement. Long\nsummers cause a great deal of forgetting. These are uncontroversial findings.\nHomework will help to the extent that many things come together: the HW is\nrelevant to the topic, students do the work, there is feedback on their\nperformance, and there is some motivation (external or internal) to improve.\nTo the extent that your data are correct, it sounds like a good argument for\nmoving to a more European-style system in which more children enter vo-tech\ntype HS programs and are sorted much earlier.

In elementary\nschool, most homework seems to have been busywork to do so the teacher could\nsay they assigned homework.2\\. Exception to #1: Beginning around 5th or 6th\ngrade (maybe as early as 4th grade?), we were assigned short stories to read\nand book reports, etc. There wasn't enough time in the class day to read in\nclass, so we had to read those at home.3\\. Another exception to #1: Well, it's\nonly a partial exception. Even when it was busywork, it taught me a measure of\nself-responsibility which ultimately was, for me, empowering. I learned to\nschedule and to plan. I probably overlearned those skills and became a little\nobsessive about it. Or a lot obsessive. It also made it harder for me in\ncollege and, especially grad school, when I had to learn to put things aside\nfor a while and focus on other things because there was too much to do all in\none night.4\\. In middle school and high school, homework was sometimes\nbusywork, but just as often necessary to learn what I was assigned. With some\nsubjects (history, French, English lit), I really looked forward to it. With\nother subjects (math, physics, chemistry), I struggled through the homework\nand didn't learn anything.....until I had a trig and calculus teacher, in my\njunior year in high school who had a different approach. She assigned the\nproblems first and had us teach ourselves how to do them. The next day, we\nwent over the problems and what we didn't understand from the textbook. I, for\none, loved this approach, because it taught me to take control over my own\nlearning and not depend on the teacher's lectures. (Of course, that approach\ndidn't work for everyone.)5\\. In college and grad school, homework was most of\nwhat I had to do when it came to learning. The lectures helped. I wouldn't've\nbeen able to get by by teaching myself and reading. But (ugh!) graduate\nseminars (where we all talked as if we knew what we were talking about, having\npretended to read the first paragraph of the introductions of any given book)\ndid very little and it was the homework. And, as I said above, the\n\"responsibility\" and work ethic I learned from my early years of homework made\nit difficult to triage.Expand full commentReply (1)Share  \n---  \n  \nGabriel ConroyJul 7, 2022Not that anyone really cares or needs to know, but my\n\"sense of responsibility\" came about because I saw homework as something I\nneeded to get done before going on to my real life. Whenever I got home from\nschool, I made sure to do my homework first. That usually wasn't because I\nloved homework, but because I saw it as a chore, all the better to finish\nquickly so I wouldn't have to worry about it.Also, I said that college and\ngrad school is where that obsession showed its dark (or at least inefficient)\nside.

Updated thoughts are at the bottom.How\nimportant is homework?I am sure tat if you look at large aggregate data, it\nwill show low effectivness for homework with respect to learning an future\nearnings.So where should you look?First a definition.Homework is type of\npractice of the concepts, processes, and skills one learned through\ninstruction. It\u2019s self-guided exploration in the zone of proximal\ndevelopment.Second, some comparisons.Singapore, Finland, South Korea all have\nhomework; they are the three of the best education systems in the world, maybe\nthey know something you don\u2019t.Third, the best interventions we know of in\nschooling are ability grouping and direct instruction. Both of these\ninterventions would change the nature of homework. Turning inconsequential\n\u201cpractice\u201d flailing about completing worksheets with deliberate practice that\nis up to the level of the student.Fourth, I run two schools which only give\nhomework two days a week and have three days a week of in-person instruction.\nWe consistently achieve above average on standardized tests and one\nconsistently rank in the top 20 of schools. So, I both am prone to belief that\npractice is important, and that the quantity of time spent in school is\ngratuitous.Given these facts, I have the following hypotheses:1\\. Homework\nwill be as effective as one\u2019s practice regimen.2\\. Homework will be effective\nif it employs the right quantity of a student\u2019s understanding.3\\. Homework is\nnecessary, because learning happens in the space between one\u2019s ears. If one is\nnot doing something with the brain, it is not learning.Maybe these are\nuncontroversial and nearly tautologically true?\\---Update:Scott brings up a\nquestion I haven't thought much about. How does homework's importance change\nwith time? At the same time time, he admits that's practicing algebra problems\nprobably makes one better at algebra. To the question about hand, I don't\nthink the answer changes much. When I watch the curriculum closely, I notice\nthat fourth grade homework is especially focused on memorization and dozens of\n'microskills' like placement of punctuation, building up 3 digit\nmultiplication, and the \"states and capitals\" world context stuff.While we\ndon't know the value of homework in the RCT Sense of 'know', I will still put\nmy confidence levels in the value of homework as high as my confidence levels\nin the value of unguided deliberate practice.Expand full commentReply (2)Share  \n---  \n  \nEducation RealistEducation Realist: no more dewe...Jul 7, 2022\"Singapore,\nFinland, South Korea all have homework; they are the three of the best\neducation systems in the world, maybe they know something you don\u2019t.\"Oh, lord.\nFirst, Finland isn't doing nearly as well as it used to, once they had to\nstart worrying about immigrant performance.

First, because it's horribly unreliable. It was\na running joke that students, teachers, and parents would all estimate\ncompletely different amounts of time for the same set of homework. Part of\nthat was that students would include things like \"I have the book open, but am\nsnapchatting with my buddies\". For tests, I generally used a 5-6x modifier--if\nI could do it in 10 minutes, I'd expect it would take the median student 50-60\nminutes.Beyond that, I actually ran an experiment (because I was lucky enough\nto have an administration that gave me carte blanche). For the last few years,\nI didn't assign \"home\"work. Instead, I did a few things:1\\. Practice time and\npractice sets in class, with me walking around helping people. If you didn't\nfinish, you'd have to do so at home. But they were scaled to take up the class\ntime.2\\. Those practice sets were *irregularly* graded. But rarely. Instead, I\ndid a combination of two assessment methods between major summative\nassessments, both fairly low stakes (~5% of the total grade, with the median\neffect being ~1% either way).2a. Pop quizzes on the previous-day's work. 3-4\nquestions, 10 minutes. Basically taken from the problem set the previous day\nwith numbers changed. Graded right there in front of everyone, usually by a\npeer as we'd walk through the problems in detail.2b. \"Online Practice Sets\",\nwhich involved a tool I wrote to generate a pocket static website that\npresented questions (multiple choice and fill in the blank, mostly) and then\nauto-graded them (including some allowed variance for numeric questions). They\ncould do them as many times as they wanted (including later on to prepare for\nthe tests), and the system would only report the highest score. The problems\nand answers were randomized (in order at least). If there was a pop quiz, it\nwould often come from those problems.I changed because I realized (both from\nsurveying students and my own observations) that traditional homework ended up\nin one of two buckets--1\\. Common enough to be useful...but then the grading\nload was too much so they didn't actually get feedback and it ended up being\ngraded on completion. This was utter garbage for everyone--no one took them\nseriously, including myself.2\\. Rare enough to have time to give meaningful\nfeedback and be scored properly. These, in turn, ended up being basically just\nanother summative assessment. And weren't frequent enough to actually provide\nany reinforcement.So switching to a basically \"no homework, but lots of\npractice embedded throughout\" system was win-win. Can I say that it had\nsubstantial effects on performance? No, because we also were revamping the\ncurriculum fairly constantly (one of the reasons I left was that we were just\nalways chasing the new hot thing instead of actually measuring whether the\nchanges were doing anything useful). But it was way more honest and the kids\nliked it more and were more engaged. Or had fewer people to blame when they\nweren't. And allowed me to target more practice for some things than others\nand let them redo their practice. Plus, the panic on their faces when they'd\nhave a pop quiz (even when it was announced) was beautiful to my jaded, evil\nsoul.Expand full commentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nkazJul 7, 2022Bear with me here...Say I wanted to improve some practical\nskill, e.g. batting in baseball (a relatively intricate motion required\ncoordination, full disclosure I don't play baseball). I expect it would be\nhard to ask a question like if I swing faster will I bat better in a single\nexperiment/study.1) A sudden shock to the learned motion most likely will make\nthings worse before they get better (at least, this is my personal\nexperience).2) To accomplish this goal I will need to adjust other elements of\nmy swing, it is hard to isolate one element at a time...To assess whether\nbatting harder is better I would instead consider the mechanism (yes, hitting\nthings harder make them go further) and some empiricism (yes, athlete that bat\nfurther hit harder).This strikes me as similar to the case for homework and\nteaching in general, the reason that we believe that homework improves\nperformance is that there is a clear mechanisms and successful teachers seem\nto have settled on a certain balance of homework. The type of study Scott\nseems to be looking for seems to be inherently fraught, like asking a someone\nto suddenly change their swing and concluding something from the experiment.\nPerhaps (speculating here) this is why there are not so many studies of this\nflavor.Expand full commentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nFeral FinsterJul 7, 2022Has anyone asked whether the student is motivated to\nlearn?

Here are a few\nother RCTs that might add some additional nuance on the question:1\\.\n\"Variations of homework amount assigned in elementary school can impact\nacademic\nachievement\"Link:https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00220973.2020.1861422a.\nAbstract:\"The utility of homework and its impact on academic achievement has\nbeen an ongoing debate for more than 100 years. To date, there is no rigorous\nexperimental research to show whether, and the extent to which, variations in\nthe amount of homework assigned can impact the academic performance of\nelementary school students. In this study, 440 second grade students were\nrandomly distributed in 3 groups within the classes they attended. Each group\nreceived different amounts of homework in writing and math for 20 days. The\nresults showed a significant immediate effect of homework quantity on writing\ncompetency (but not on math competency). The writing homework effects were\nsustained 4 months later, but only for the group that had allocated a moderate\namount of homework to writing skills practice. This study shows that the\nadditional opportunities for practice offered by homework can have\ndifferential short-term and medium-term effects on the academic achievement of\nelementary school students and supports the assignment of a moderate amount of\nwriting homework at this age\"b. CommentaryI can understand not including this\none in your review.There's not much to like about the design of the study, or\nthe figures within the writeup (both are overly complicated, particularly the\nfigures).Still I did their findings (and underpinning theory) plausible for\n2nd grade kids, and so for all completists, note this RCT and its\ntakeaways.2\\. \"The Role of Homework in Student Learning Outcomes: Evidence\nfrom a Field\nExperiment\"Link:https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1592889a.\nAbstract:\"In this article, the authors describe a field experiment in the\nclassroom where principles of micro- economics students are randomly assigned\ninto homework-required and not-required groups. The authors find that homework\nplays an important role in student learning, especially so for students who\ninitially perform poorly in the course. Students in the homework-required\ngroup have higher retention rates, higher test scores (5 to 6 percent), more\ngood grades (Bs), and lower failure rates. The authors also study the\nrelationship between endogenous homework submission and test performance using\ninstrumental variable estimation and find that homework submission has a large\npositive effect on test performance.\"b. CommentaryThe gains appear real, and\nwhile modest also meaningful, across outcomes.It was also striking how much\nhomework students in the \u201cno-homework\u201d group opted out of; making it a\nrequirement changes behavior to a much larger extent than I would have\nexpected in this setting (college).3\\. \"Online Mathematics Homework Increases\nStudent Achievement\" (Michael Pershan mentioned this in an earlier\ncomment.)Link:https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2332858416673968a.\nAbstract:\"In a randomized field trial with 2,850 seventh-grade mathematics\nstudents, we evaluated whether an educational technology intervention\nincreased mathematics learning. Assigning homework is common yet sometimes\ncontroversial. Building on prior research on formative assessment and adaptive\nteaching, we predicted that combining an online homework tool with teacher\ntraining could increase learning. The online tool ASSISTments (a) provides\ntimely feedback and hints to students as they do homework and (b) gives\nteachers timely, organized information about students\u2019 work. To test this\nprediction, we analyzed data from 43 schools that participated in a random\nassignment experiment in Maine, a state that provides every seventh-grade\nstudent with a laptop to take home. Results showed that the intervention\nsignificantly increased student scores on an end-of-the-year standardized\nmathematics assessment as compared with a control group that continued with\nexisting homework.\"b. CommentaryI can also understand not including this one\nin your review, as it\u2019s NOT a \"to homework, or not to homework, that is the\nquestion\" study in the strictest sense. But an interesting comment on what\n*kind* of homework works.One notable finding is that it helped low-achieving\nkids more (same as study 2). Effects were ~0.29 for kids below the median,\n~0.12 for kids above it.In contrast to study 1, and I know this is a matter of\ntaste in some respects, I really liked the study. No deception or tricky\nmaneuvering, as far as I can tell.4\\. \"Disrupting Education? Experimental\nEvidence on Technology-Aided Instruction in\nIndia\"Link:https://econweb.ucsd.edu/~kamurali/papers/Working%20Papers/Disrupting%20Education%20(Current%20WP).pdfa.\nAbstract:\"We study the impact of a personalized technology-aided after-school\ninstruction program in middle-school grades in urban India using a lottery\nthat provided winners free access to the program. Lottery winners scored 0.37\u03c3\nhigher in math and 0.23\u03c3 higher in Hindi over just a 4.5-month period. IV\nestimates suggest that attending the program for 90 days would increase math\nand Hindi test scores by 0.6\u03c3 and 0.39\u03c3 respectively. We find similar absolute\ntest score gains for all students, but much greater relative gains for\nacademically-weaker students. Our results suggest that well-designed\ntechnology-aided instruction programs can sharply improve productivity in\ndelivering education.\"b. CommentaryWhether this is \"homework\" or \"an after-\nschool program\" is a matter of debate. I think 85% former and 15% latter in my\ninterpretation. The software just happened to be really good, targeted\nhomework.I also think the broader context of education in low and middle\nincome countries might be useful here. Schools, by and large, are staggeringly\nunproductive in generating learning relative to those in high-income\ncountries.

I suspect that\nmatters quite a bit.-Highest RoI, subject-wise, seems to be in math, though it\nmight just be relatively overstudied (all 5 of the studies included math or\nmath-adjacent stuff), and there were high returns to Hindi as well in the\nMindspark study, and no impact at all on math in Study 1.-Highest RoI,\ndistribution-wise, seems to be with lower-performing pupils, though caveat\nemptor: my guess is that they are also unusually responsive to feedback;\nsimply assigning low-performing kids homework and not correcting it may\nbackfire.Expand full commentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nNateArgRankJul 7, 2022I wonder if non-teachers are aware that there is a\ngrowing anti-homework movement that's equity motivated.

The kids who\nunderstand the subject in class waste time doing things they already know. The\nkids who don\u2019t know how to do the task don\u2019t get any help so they will hardly\nget better. More time spent doing the thing will increase capabilities a bit\nbut I have to be conscious of my pupil\u2019s private life as well. They need time\nto learn the piano or play soccer or be kids or whatever. There\u2019s so much\nlearning possible if I don\u2019t waste their time.That said (as a primary school\nteacher), they will have to learn to read and write.

If\nyou look at artists who practice for a long time, their skill levels tend to\ngo up; in some cases, this can be especially dramatic if you catch people very\nearly in their artistic careers. A good example of this would be Miss Mab; if\nyou look at the very oldest comic she posted, back in high school (\nhttp://www.missmab.com/Comics/Vol_001.php ) and then compare it to what she\ndoes today ( http://www.missmab.com/Comics/Vol_2084.php ) the difference is\nstark. Even if you look at a lesser time span within that, like five years\nbetween this ( http://www.missmab.com/Comics/Abel_03.php ) and this (\nhttp://www.missmab.com/Comics/Ab_098.php ), you can see significant\nimprovements.However, at some point, unless you push yourself to do new\nthings, these gains can become increasingly limited. For instance, this comic\nfrom 2013 ( http://www.missmab.com/Comics/Vol_1389.php ) and this comic from\n2019 ( http://www.missmab.com/Comics/Vol_1896.php ) is a larger time gap, but\nthe gains are clearly not as significant - she was already quite good at art\nin 2013, and while she did get better over time (particularly at backgrounds)\nthe advances have not been as large.As such, doing homework is valuable, but\ndoing infinite amounts of homework isn't - there's declining returns, and you\nget larger returns by pushing yourself further along the road rather than\nendlessly repeating the skills you already have.I think this is where people\nget unahppy about homework. The more skill you already have, the worse the\ngains will become by doing the same thing over and over.I suspect this is why\nhomework appers increasingly more valuable as students get older - in\nelementary school, a lot of the higher end students already baically know\neverything or most everything elementary school teaches them. As such,\nelementary school homework is a waste of time for them.However, lower end\nstudents are not nearly as good at this stuff, and as such, will see\nsignificantly larger benefits because they don't already know this stuff.A kid\nwho enters elementary school reading the kinds of books you read in 6th grade\nor even high school is going to get almost nothing from elementary school\nEnglish classes.I also suspect this is why math homework seems so valuable by\ncomparison - few parents teach their children much math independent of school,\nand particularly not higher levels of it, and people generally don't naturally\ndo much repetition of math at that age, so math homework will seem very\nvaluable. And once you hit algebra, I think that goes way beyond what 90%+ of\nparents will ever spend time drilling kids on independently.Conversely, a lot\nof kids enjoy reading books, so a lot of other subjects are more likely to be\ncovered. I enjoyed reading Zoobooks and various science books, so I had a huge\nlevel of knowledge matter on the subject. I even read some textbooks for fun\nbecause I was a horrible little monster like that.This meant that I had a\nridiculous advantage over everyone else in science class, even through high\nschool and early college. I knew this stuff back and front and could spend\nvery little time on work and get better grades because I had already put in\nthe work through years and years of independent \"study\", so the homework was\nentirely pointless for me.But if I tried the same thing with college calculus,\nI was doomed.So, yes. I think that homework is valuable because it is forced\nrepetition of learning ,but I think that \"pre-existing knowledge\" is a greatly\nunderappreciated confounding variable.I think you will see larger benefits of\npeople doing homework in subject matters that they don't independent study\nthan those that they do, and I think you will see larger benefits of homework\nthe more advanced the subject matter is, as that means that fewer and fewer\nstudents will have natural background in it, and that you will see larger\nbenefits on lower end students for lower-level materials than you will see for\nhigher-level students on lower-end materials.Expand full commentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nIvermectin: Much More Than You Wanted To Know\n\n...\n\nNov 17, 2021\n\n403\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Ivermectin: Much More Than You Wanted To Know\n\nwww.astralcodexten.com\n\n2,155\n\nStill Alive\n\nYou just keep on trying till you run out of cake\n\nJan 21, 2021\n\n1,197\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Still Alive\n\nwww.astralcodexten.com\n\n512\n\nIn The Long Run, We're All Dad\n\n...\n\nDec 22, 2023\n\n1,037\n\nShare this post\n\n#### In The Long Run, We're All Dad\n\nwww.astralcodexten.com\n\n460\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Scott Alexander\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
