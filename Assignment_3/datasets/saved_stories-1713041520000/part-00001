We\u2019ll begin with the quirky new tool on Udio.com and how\nmusicians are reacting to it, then cover the strange manner of the release of\nGPT-4-Turbo with Vision and quickly touch on Mixtral 8 x 22b and Command R+\nbefore turning to a fascinating new \u2018Infinite Context\u2019 paper from Google. One\nof the authors worked on Gemini, but that may or may not be relevant...\nhttps://www.assemblyai.com/dashboard/...\nhttps://www.assemblyai.com/research/u...
