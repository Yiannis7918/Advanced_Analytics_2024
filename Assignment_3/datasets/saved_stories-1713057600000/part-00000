The charge can last for up\nto a month and it easily fits in a pocket or purse. In particular, for sports,\nlong meetings, airplanes, or just at your desk while you are working.\n\nQ How is this different from other vibration devices?\n\nA: There are hundreds of devices on the market which vibrate. Almost none are\nbacked by an actual clinical trial and have an FDA indication with well-\ndefined mechanical specifications. The iTEAR^\u00ae100 device has a very specific\nfrequency, a specifically defined motion, amplitude, force, and tip design,\nall optimized through clinical work and several product iterations. And,\nimportantly an \u201cRx\u201d and specific label has been reviewed by the FDA. The\nfrequency is much higher than any vibration device, as is the force on the\ntip. Oscillation of the iTEAR^\u00ae100 tip is in a single direction, with a small\nsurface area. So, it can safely be applied to activate the external nasal\nnerve. In contrast, almost every vibration device on the market has a\n3-dimensional motion with a large surface area and lower frequency, creating\nlarge force on a broad area of skin which is largely ineffective to activate\nthe external nasal nerve and can injure your nose.\n\nQ: What makes iTEAR^\u00ae100 unique from the other eye products?\n\nA: iTEAR^\u00ae100 is a neurostimulation device which works though a nerve that can\nbe stimulated on the outside of your nose with highly specific mechanical\nvibrations. iTEAR^\u00ae100 has been cleared by the FDA and has a specific, highly\nregulated function. Look for an \u201cRx\u201d label on other products to insure similar\nwell defined specifications. iTEAR^\u00ae100 does not run out during its 30 day\nprescription so you do not have to conserve therapy or worry about wasted\npractice drops or sprays. The manually controlled therapy also allows for\nquick on/off and customized placement to maximize nerve stimulation for each\npatient. You are in control.\n\nQ: How is this different than other treatments?\n\nA: The iTEAR^\u00ae100 is the ONLY FDA-cleared medical device that stimulates\nnatural tear formation extranasally. All iTEAR^\u00ae100 clinical trials and\nmarketing claims on safety and efficacy have been reviewed and cleared by the\nFDA. Check package labelling carefully for an \u201cRx\u201d or Prescription Use Only\nStatement before using other products.\n\nQ: How do I get an iTEAR^\u00ae device?\n\nA: You can get iTEAR^\u00ae100 from your doctor or directly from the company\nwebsite. It\u2019s a prescription device regulated by the FDA and will need\nprescription from a doctor. If your doctor does not prescribe iTEAR^\u00ae100, you\ncan request am telehealth appointment and the company will assign a doctor to\nyou.\n\nQ: How long does this last?\n\nA: The iTEAR^\u00ae100 device prescription lasts 30 days at which time it turns off\nand you will need a new prescription from your doctor for further treatment.\nAfter 30 days, the device will be inactive. Please ask your doctor to provide\nyou with a new prescription. Once you have a new prescription, the device will\nbe activated to work for another 30 days.\n\nQ: Is there a daily limit to treatment?\n\nA: The iTEAR^\u00ae100 device has unlimited ON time during the 30 day prescription.\nTalk to your Doctor about the amount of usage time that is right for you.\n\nQ: My device seems to not work anymore.\n\nA: If your device stopped working, it could be because your prescription has\nexpired, and the device has been deactivated. Talk to your doctor about\ngetting another refill prescription for iTEAR^\u00ae100. Or you can request a\ntelehealth appointment and the company will assign a doctor to you.\n\nQ: My eyes are not tearing up the same as the first time.\n\nA: In most people, when they start iTEAR^\u00ae100 use, it brings on reflexive\nwatery eyes which mask the basal tears of the user. After a short period, your\nbody adapts to the stimulation, and instead of more liquid, your tear film\nwill become thicker. This is because now there are more basal tears that are\nof higher quality. Observe yourself in the mirror during treatment to\nunderstand the effect of your body\u2019s adaptation. This change in tears is\nnormal. The device will continue to generate tears needed to soothe your dry\neyes.\n\nQ: Is there insurance coverage?\n\nA: At this time, insurance is generally not available for iTEAR^\u00ae100. You can\nuse an HSA or FSA plan however. Talk to your doctor about the device cost. It\nwas specifically designed to provide high value treatment without requiring\ninsurance coverage to enable broad access for patients.\n\nQ: Can I use this with other treatments?\n\nA: Yes, you can use this with any other drugs or therapies because it is not a\ndrug, and it will not interact with anything else your doctor has prescribed.\n\nQ: How often should I use this?\n\nA: It is recommended that you use this device 2 times per day to start \u2013\nmorning and night on a continuous basis through the month. It\u2019s up to 30\nseconds on each side for each eye. Download our clinical publication and\npatient instructions for additional information.\n\nQ: I am too sensitive to the initial treatment and cannot use this device.\n\nA: Consider signing up for our usability clinical trial in which we are\nevaluating lower intensities to further be able to offer an optimized\ntreatment for each patient. Contact us to participate in the trial.\n\nQ: What are the side effects?\n\nA: About 2-3% of patients reported dizziness or lightheadedness in clinical\nstudies.\n\n### For more information on how to get iTEAR^\u00ae100:\n\nBuy Now\n\n160 NW Gilman Blvd #412 Issaquah, WA 98027\n\n  * 650-300-9340\n  * info@oo-med.com\n\nLinkedin\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Our History\n  * Our Board\n\n#### Get our App\n\n#### Products\n\n  * iTEAR^\u00ae100\n  * How-to Video\n  * FAQs\n\n#### Clinical Studies\n\n  * Clinical Data\n  * Press Releases\n\n\u00a9 2022 Olympic Ophthalmics Inc.\n\nRev A\n\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by\nremembering your preferences and repeat visits.
