Based\non recent updates, it appears Iran unleashed around 300 drones and several\ndozen ballistic missiles. In response, Israel activated its air defenses,\nsuccessfully intercepting the majority of these airborne threats.\n\n> #BREAKING: Remarkable footage shows an exoatmospheric interception occurring\n> outside the Earth\u2019s atmosphere during Iran's missile attack\n>\n> #Israel | #MiddleEast\n>\n> Watch as remarkable and rare footage from tonight showing what appears to be\n> an exoatmospheric interception.

A solitary \u201ccolored balloon\u201d sparks momentarily in the dark sky\nbefore fading. Shortly after that, another appears in a different form.\nWitnesses contend that this was the exoatmospheric interception of an Iranian\nballistic missile.\n\nPhoto credit: AFP\n\n## Understanding the exoatmospheric interception\n\nExoatmospheric interception refers to the act of intercepting a ballistic\nmissile while it is outside the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. In more technical terms,\nthe Earth\u2019s atmosphere ends approximately 100 kilometers above sea level, a\nboundary known as the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line. Any interception that takes place beyond\nthis boundary is considered exoatmospheric.\n\nBallistic missiles, after being launched, follow a trajectory that takes them\noutside the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. This is known as the missile\u2019s midcourse\nphase, and it is during this phase that exoatmospheric interception is\ntypically attempted. The goal is to destroy the missile while it is in space\nbefore it has the chance to release any warheads.\n\nPhoto credit: Raytheon\n\nExoatmospheric interception involves a complex sequence of events. First, the\nincoming missile must be detected, usually by radar or satellite. Then, an\ninterceptor missile is launched, guided by data from ground-based radar and\npossibly onboard sensors. The interceptor must then locate and collide with\nthe target in space, a task often likened to hitting a bullet with another\nbullet.\n\nSuccessful exoatmospheric interception requires exact calculations and timing.\nThe interceptor must match the speed, trajectory, and altitude of the incoming\nmissile to collide with it. This is a challenging feat, given the high speeds\nat which both the interceptor and the incoming missile are traveling.\n\n## Israel and the US can\n\nPhoto credit: IDF Navy\n\nIt could possibly be, should the exoatmospheric interception be substantiated,\nthat we are looking at the first exoatmospheric interception carried out in\nreal conflict on April 14th. This event is rather notable as most\ninterceptions are primarily theoretical, restricted to simulations or drills.\n\nLet\u2019s delve into the details. Both Israel and the U.S. are equipped with\nweapons capable of executing exoatmospheric interceptions. According to\nseasoned experts and avid observers alike, we may be looking at two primary\ncontenders for this interception \u2013 the Hertz 3 or Strela 3 interceptor, as\nit\u2019s alternatively known, or the SM-3 interceptor from the U.S. Navy.\n\n## Understanding the Arrow 3\n\nPhoto credit: MDA\n\nThe Israeli Arrow 3 is an exoatmospheric anti-ballistic missile, designed to\nintercept and destroy long-range ballistic missiles while they\u2019re still\noutside the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Developed by Israel Aerospace Industries and\nBoeing, the Arrow 3 interceptor is a result of a joint venture between Israel\nand the United States. The Arrow 3 is specifically designed to counter threats\nposed by intercontinental ballistic missiles [ICBMs] and is capable of\nmultiple simultaneous interceptions.\n\nThe Arrow 3 interceptor operates using a \u2018hit-to-kill\u2019 approach, which means\nit is designed to collide directly with the target to destroy it. This is\nachieved through a highly advanced radar system and a kinetic kill vehicle,\nwhich separates from the missile after launch and travels toward the target\nusing its own propulsion system. The kill vehicle is equipped with sensors\nthat help it detect and track the target, ensuring a precise interception.\n\nThe Arrow 3 interceptor system is also designed to work in conjunction with\nthe U.S. radar system, enhancing its detection and tracking capabilities. This\ninteroperability with the U.S. system not only strengthens Israel\u2019s defense\ncapabilities but also contributes to the global missile defense architecture.\n\n## Understanding the SM-3\n\nThe US Navy\u2019s SM-3 interceptor, also known as the Standard Missile 3, is a\nship-based missile system used by the United States Navy to intercept short-\nto intermediate-range ballistic missiles.\n\nThe SM-3 interceptor operates in three stages. The first stage is the \u2018boost\nphase\u2019, where the missile is launched from a ship and propelled into space.\nThe second stage, known as the \u2018midcourse phase\u2019, involves the missile\u2019s\nflight through space, where it uses onboard sensors and ground-based radars to\nadjust its course. The final stage, the \u2018terminal phase\u2019, is when the\nmissile\u2019s \u2018kill vehicle\u2019 separates from the rest of the missile to collide\nwith the incoming enemy missile, destroying it upon impact.\n\nPhoto credit: MDA\n\nDespite its impressive capabilities, the SM-3 interceptor is not designed to\ncounter all types of missile threats. It is primarily intended to intercept\nshort- to intermediate-range ballistic missiles and is less effective against\nintercontinental ballistic missiles [ICBMs] or hypersonic glide vehicles.\n\n## What\u2019s next?\n\nWhen a ballistic missile is intercepted in the exoatmosphere, the first event\nto unfold is the detonation of the interceptor\u2019s kill vehicle. The impact of\nthe kill vehicle causes the missile to disintegrate, resulting in a cloud of\ndebris. This debris is composed of remnants from both the missile and the\ninterceptor. Although this debris continues to follow the missile\u2019s original\ntrajectory, forces from the explosion, along with the absence of atmospheric\ndrag, cause it to spread out and disperse.\n\nThe warhead of the missile, if undestroyed in the initial impact, may also\npersist on the original trajectory. However, the force of the explosion could\npotentially knock it off its course. Even if the warhead is not entirely\ndestroyed, the likelihood that it could still detonate is significantly\nminimized.\n\nIn the circumstance that the warhead is nuclear, an interception in the\nexoatmosphere proves especially advantageous as it minimizes the risk of\nnuclear fallout. The explosion would take place in space, a great distance\nfrom Earth\u2019s surface, thereby causing any radioactive material to scatter in\nspace rather than in Earth\u2019s atmosphere. However, the debris from the\ninterception could pose a possible threat to satellites and other objects in\norbit. The dissemination of debris in the exoatmosphere could lead to a layer\nof space junk circling the Earth, potentially inflicting damage to any objects\nin its path.\n\n## Arrow 3 has combat experience\n\nAbout the interception of the Iranian threat in the exoatmosphere, it\u2019s\nimportant to note that, even if this feat is accomplished by the Israeli\ninterceptor, it won\u2019t mark its first-ever combat mission. Specifically, it\ncould represent the Arrow 3\u2019s inaugural exoatmospheric interception, but this\nisn\u2019t its first experience in downing a ballistic missile.\n\nTake, for instance, a moment back in November 2023. Israel officially\nannounced that their Arrow 3 had successfully intercepted a ballistic missile\nover the Red Sea. However, this particular occurrence did not take place in\nthe exoatmosphere. According to reports from Israeli sources at that time, the\nmissile in question was launched from Yemen by the Houthis. This gesture was\napparently an effort by the group to show solidarity with the terrorist\norganization, Hamas, and to divert Israel\u2019s attention from its military\noperations in Gaza.\n\n***\n\nFollow us everywhere and at any time.
