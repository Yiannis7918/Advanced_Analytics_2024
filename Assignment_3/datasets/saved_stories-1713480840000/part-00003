Have an account? .\n\n  * David Lieb, creator of the Bump app, is stepping up as a group partner at Y Combinator.\n  * He spent nine years at Google, which acquired his startup, leading product for Google Photos.\n  * Lieb's journey from Google to angel investor led him back to the accelerator after beating leukemia.\n\nBack in 2009, David Lieb had created a sensation with Bump, his wildly popular\napp that lets users share photos and contact info just by bumping their\ndevices together. After he and a couple of buddies assembled the app during\nhis early days in business school, its booming success led Apple to feature it\nin its \"There's an app for that\" TV spot.\n\nHowever, one night that summer, Lieb faced an unexpected crisis. Apple's ad\nhad aired during \"Dancing with the Stars,\" causing a stampede of downloads\nthat crashed Bump's servers. Lieb, having a background in semiconductors and\nnot server management, reached out to his fellow Y Combinator founders for\nsupport. In half an hour, backup arrived from Alex Polvi and his team from\nCloudkick, who swiftly brought the servers back online.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an\nInsider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nThis event solidified Lieb's belief in the true value of Y Combinator \u2014 not\nthe money or the advice, but the fraternity of startup founders he was part\nof.\n\nLieb is now set to return the favor. After a year and a half of advising at\nthe accelerator, he's stepping up as a group partner, Y Combinator tells\nBusiness Insider exclusively. He joins a cadre of alumni, including Garry Tan,\nJared Friedman, Harj Taggar, and Michael Seibel, who returned to shepherd the\nnext generation of founders.\n\nTheir arrival comes when the accelerator's value is hotly contested. People\nhave debated if its standard deal \u2014 it takes 7% of the company for half a\nmillion in funding \u2014 is worth the dilution founders take. Plus, the advent of\ngenerative artificial intelligence has made it possible for builders to do\nmore with less cash on hand. Sam Altman says it's only a matter of time before\none person builds a billion-dollar company.\n\nAs we usher in an era where founders go further with a copilot at their\nfingertips, will Y Combinator still prove its worth in sculpting billion-\ndollar moonshots?\n\nThis dispute misses the point for Lieb, who shares a deeper kinship to the\nprogram as an alum and a co-investor.\n\n\"Once you're a YC founder, you're always a YC founder,\" Lieb said.\n\nDan Lieb, second from left, smiles onstage during an event at Y Combinator's\ngrand new hub in San Francisco. Y Combinator\n\n## From founder to Xoogler\n\nBump still managed to shine bright in a cohort that included heavy hitters\nlike Patrick and John Collison's Stripe and Suhail Doshi's Mixpanel. Before\nthe program was over, it had garnered tens of millions of downloads and\nfunding from the who's who of Silicon Valley. In 2011, Lieb's old college\ncomrade and cofounder, Jake Mintz, even landed a spot on Forbes' \"30 Under 30\"\nlist alongside Kevin Systrom.\n\nWhile riding this wave of success, the company launched another app, Flock.\nThis app nudged users to share photos with their Flock friends, who snapped\nphotos at the same time and place.\n\nHowever, Bump's golden run hit a speed bump. Flock turned out to be a dud.\nBump, while still popular, didn't have a revenue model. Lieb recalls, \"We had\nthis weird dichotomy where like we have the most popular app in the world and\nno plan for how we're ever going to make money.\" Investors lost interest.\n\nFor Flock to work, you had to persuade your friends and family to download the\napp. This hang-up led Lieb to realize that a stand-alone app wasn't the answer\nto simplifying photo sharing. The solution had to become the camera roll\nitself.\n\nRelated stories\n\nSo, in just a week, Lieb and his team, including tech maestro and cofounder\nAndy Huibers, whipped up an app dedicated to managing photos. In this way, the\nnew app was Bump's Hail Mary pass. And it caught Google's attention.\n\n> So we redesigned Flock to make it a photo gallery app first, and sharing app\n> second. We called the new version Photoroll.\n>\n> It was never released, but many of the ideas would later come back in the\n> form of Google Photos. pic.twitter.com/72m2YgJZq8\n>\n> \u2014 David Lieb (@dflieb) October 13, 2018\n\nIn 2013, Google acquired Bump. Though Bump and Flock were shut down, the yet-\nto-be-released camera roll app became the basis for Google Photos. Lieb became\nits product lead, and a year and a half later, he took the stage at Google\nI/O, the tech giant's annual developers conference in San Francisco, to show\noff the all-new Google Photos. It was a runaway hit, reaching 1 billion users\nin merely four years.\n\nLieb stayed nine years at Google, as did many of Bump's former employees.\n\nHe put his Google paycheck to good use, helping other startups prosper. His\nfirst spark of angel investing ignited at a wedding, where he met a guest\nworking on a logistics solution. \"That turned out to be Ryan Peterson from\nFlexport,\" Lieb said. From there, he reached into the Y Combinator alumni\nnetwork to find other promising upstarts. Lieb's portfolio now boasts tech\ndarlings like Rippling, Tally, Skydio, and Rewind.ai.\n\n\"You find that of all these people that are just your friends,\" Lieb said,\n\"some fraction of them turn out to start billion-dollar companies.\"\n\n## How beating cancer brought Lieb back to Y Combinator\n\nThree years ago, Lieb was a new parent feeling run down. He went to a One\nMedical office to get some routine lab tests done. The next day, he got a call\nfrom a corporate dispatcher telling him he needed to go to the hospital\nurgently. The doctors told Lieb he had leukemia.\n\n\"I basically told my team at Google, 'Hey guys, sorry, but I'm going to be\ngone for a year or forever. See you,'\" Lieb said. \"And so I just disappeared\nand I focused on that, and I was thankful enough to be able to beat it.\" He's\nnow in remission.\n\nReturning to Google, though, sparked a realization. The endless conference\nroom meetings had taken over the hands-on product building he craved, while\nhis team had done just fine in his absence. He questioned what he truly\nwanted.\n\n\"Now I get this bonus lifetime,\" Lieb recalls. \"How do I want to spend it?\"\n\nDavid Lieb, second from left, speaks to a group of Y Combinator founders. Y\nCombinator\n\nA simple litmus test emerged. He asked what thrilled him the most during his\nworkday. More often than not, it was the golden hour spent interacting with\nthe founders he had backed or ones from the accelerator where he started.\n\nThen it clicked. Lieb said, \"I should work at YC.\"\n\nLieb came back into the fold as a visiting partner: a short-term, full-time\nrole that gives seasoned operators a chance to embed with a batch and decide\nif the accelerator is a good fit.\n\nIn the last year and a half, Lieb's locked arms with founders building\neverything from a platform for hosting open-source large language models to a\nwhite-glove sales tax service for e-commerce stores to back-office software\nfor liquor stores.\n\nOn Tuesday nights, he's in the bustling mess hall of Y Combinator's grand new\nhub in San Francisco. Surrounded by the energetic pulse of founders and\npartners sharing a meal, engaged in vigorous demos and discussions about the\nlatest ideas, Lieb feels right at home.\n\n\"This,\" he said, \"is where I want to be.\"\n\nAre you a startup founder or someone with a tip or insight to share?
