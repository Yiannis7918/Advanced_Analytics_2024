Sure, it may not look as pretty as its AAA contemporaries on\nthe other consoles, but Nintendo's impressive physics and mechanics under the\nhood impressed game developers across the industry when Tears of the Kingdom\nlaunched last year.\n\nAs it turns out, developing a physics-driven world where the player can glue\ntogether anything they want was incredibly difficult, and Nintendo is finally\npulling back the curtain on some of the reasons why. During Nintendo's Tears\nof the Kingdom panel at GDC, Senior Director Takuhiro Dohta, Sound Programmer\nJunya Osada, and Physics Programmer Takahiro Takayama explained how Tears of\nthe Kingdom's impressive world came to be.\n\n### An Entirely Physics-Driven World\n\nThe developers explained that the philosophy behind both Breath of the Wild\nand Tears of the Kingdom is something they call \"multiplicative gameplay\",\nwhere action and objects come together to create countless possibilities. When\nit came time to begin development on Tears of the Kingdom, the Zelda team felt\nthere was potential to enhance that philosophy by allowing players to stick\nmultiple objects to each other. This idea would eventually be finalized as\nLink's Ultrahand ability, but it was a long road to get there.\n\n\"When I first saw the prototype, I was excited that this was going to be a\ngreat game, but this was going to be very, very difficult,\" Takayama said. \"I\nsaid to myself, 'Are we really doing this?'\"\n\nBut the team had the courage to push forward, guided by two main goals: to\ncreate an entirely physics-driven world, and to create a system where unique\ninteractions happen without any dedicated implementation.\n\nNintendo shared early glitchy prototypes like throwing a stone onto a cart and\nhorse, causing it to zip straight into the air. Takayama said the freedom\nUltrahand offered caused chaos in Hyrule during development: \"I would hear\nthings like, 'It broke! It went flying!' And I\u2019d respond with, 'I know! We\u2019ll\ndeal with it later!'\u201d\n\nThe solution to many of the issues Nintendo faced was to remove all non-\nphysics items and make everything physics-driven. One example of this is\ngates, which were originally not physics-driven, making it difficult to\nnavigate while using Ultrahand. So, Nintendo changed how gates function to fix\nthe issue.\n\nInterestingly, changing the way gates worked led to unexpected discoveries\nwithin Nintendo. One of the most joyous parts of Tears of the Kingdom is\ndiscovering unintended solutions to puzzles within Hyrule's many Shrines, and\nit turns out Zelda developers themselves got to experience that same feeling\nduring development. One Shrine originally had to be solved by weighing down a\nswitch using a block of ice, but with the new gate technology, the developers\ndiscovered you could completely avoid the switch and still solve the puzzle.\n\n### A System That Makes Fun Things Happen\n\nDohta emphasized that rather than creating something fun, Nintendo wanted to\ncreate a spontaneous system that makes fun things happen. This idea permeated\nthroughout Tears of the Kingdom's different systems, including creating a\nsystem to make objects move, a system that makes noises sound a certain way,\nor a system that causes unique interactions.\n\nThis also translated to Tears of the Kingdom's vehicles, where Nintendo\nimplemented a system where players can create a vehicle themselves using\nwheels, steering sticks, and whatever else they can find. The whole staff had\nto work together on these items, as complex objects like wagons were designed\nbased on the physics first and foremost, leaving the artists to create the\nbest possible look for them. The team had a testing room to make sure all of\nthe objects were working at any given time, and the developers on stage said\nworking with designers and artists who understood the vision was essential to\nbring Tears of the Kingdom's world to life.\n\nThe sound design in Tears of the Kingdom is also incredibly complex. Osada\nexplained that the world contains voxel information to create a 3D terrain.\nVoxels are data points on a 3D grid that store information. In Zelda, each\nvoxel sources information about the terrain, like if it's inside or outside,\nnear water, near a forest, if Ascend is possible, and more. A search algorithm\ndetermines how sound interacts with the voxels, like sound changing when an\nobject is behind a wall.\n\nJust like the design philosophy for the rest of the game, sounds in Tears of\nthe Kingdom play in a system without dedicated implemenation, and in some\ncases abstract sounds combine to create something entirely new. For example,\nthere is no dedicated wagon sound or paddle boat sound, these sounds are\ncreated by the wheels rolling or rotating on the water, with the quality\nchanging based on the size, shape, and material. Osada said, \"It\u2019s making\nsounds that I have no memory of creating! Even the director told us, 'This is\nbasically a physics engine for sound, isn\u2019t it?'\u201d\n\nTears of the Kingdom is incredibly complicated, and the aspects the developers\ntouched on during the GDC panel barely scratch the surface of everything going\non at once in Hyrule. It's no wonder the Zelda sequel took home IGN's award\nfor the Best Game of 2023.\n\nFor more on Zelda, check out our interview with Tears of the Kingdom director\nHidemaro Fujibayashi and series producer Eiji Aonuma.\n\nAdditional reporting by Kat Bailey.\n\nLogan Plant is IGN's Database Manager, Playlist Editor, occasional news\nwriter, and frequent Super Ninfriendo on Nintendo Voice Chat.
