This will create default settings, so you can edit them later to create appropriate working hours rules.\n\n    \n    \n    python3 manage.py loaddata worktime/fixtures/standardworkpattern.json\n\n  * Start the server. For example, to start with Django's functions, run the following command.\n\n    \n    \n    python3 manage.py runserver\n\n### Initial setting\n\n  * Log in as superuser in a web browser to access the administration screen.\n  * First, set the working time pattern for each day of the week on the \"Work Pattern\" screen. Be sure to perform this setting first before starting application operation.\n  * Use the following command to initialize the working hours for each day of the week and create a business day calendar.\n\n    \n    \n    python3 manage.py create_calendar\n\n  * Register the user who will be stamping the time by adding users as appropriate from the management screen.\n\n### Adding commands to monthly tasks\n\n  * Register the following command to be executed once a month in a regular task such as crontab.\n\n    \n    \n    python3 manage.py create_calendar\n\n### Disabling a user\n\n  * If you want to disable a user due to retirement, etc., we recommend unchecking the user's \"enabled\" checkbox on the administrator screen. If you delete it, you will no longer be able to view that user's past attendance history.\n  * Users whose \"Enabled\" checkbox is unchecked will be displayed with a \"*\" symbol after their \"Name\" when displayed in a list.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n## About\n\nNo description, website, or topics provided.\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\n### License\n\nMIT license\n\nActivity\n\n### Stars\n\n0 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n1 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n0 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases\n\nNo releases published\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Languages\n\n  * Python 68.1%\n  * HTML 31.9%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
