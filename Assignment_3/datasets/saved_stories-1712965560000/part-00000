Prior to Keeper, she helped scale\nunicorn life insurance startup Ethos, and before that she worked in investing.\nIn her free time, she runs marathons and pampers her two cats.\n\nUpdated\n\nApril 11, 2024\n\nReviewed by\n\nReviewed by\n\nA year ago, the debut of GPT-4 started a new era of intelligent software.\nInitially, it wasn\u2019t clear if tax preparation would be impacted. Could people\nreally trust AI with something this sensitive?\n\nAt Keeper, we knew the answer was \u201cyes\u201d. We\u2019d been building with earlier GPT\nmodels for years and knew that taxpayers weren\u2019t as attached to a human face\nso long as the answers were good. For us, Gen AI felt like the missing puzzle\npiece we needed to realize our five-year vision in one year.\n\nThe result is a new paradigm for tax prep software. We call it \u201c3-Step\nFiling\u201d.\n\n# What\u2019s 3-Step Filing?\n\nFor decades, tax filing software has been synonymous with DIY (Do It\nYourself). Without AI, software relied on a rules-based system that couldn\u2019t\nquite handle the complexities of tax law. The resulting tax filing experience\nis a maze of questions that shifts the responsibility for accuracy to\ntaxpayers.\n\n3-Step Filing takes a radically different approach. It mimics the experience\nof sitting down with a personal accountant: drop-dead simple, no hard\nquestions, smart enough to make assumptions on your behalf. Let's break it\ndown.\n\n## Step 1: Info dump\n\nLike with a great accountant, you should be able to just dump your \u201ctax stuff\u201d\nand have the software figure out what to do with it. Tax forms are an\nimportant part of this, but they\u2019re not enough. Taxpayers often don\u2019t even\nremember everything they\u2019re supposed to report. From itemized deductions to\nvarious credits that don\u2019t come with their own forms, 3-Step Filing ensures\nnothing is overlooked. Transaction data, an incredibly rich data source when\nprocessed effectively, pinpoints potential deductions or credits, like\nchildcare or overlooked income from places like Coinbase to personalize the\ntax filing experience.\n\n## Step 2: Keeper prepares your return\n\nNext, Keeper sifts through your information, crafting a short list of\n\u201cclarifying questions\u201d tailored specifically to you, much like an accountant\nwould. These can range from the banal \u201cLet\u2019s confirm your home office square\nfootage\u201d to the delightfully specific \u201cMost real estate agents include their\nannual license fee as an itemized business deduction, are you sure you don\u2019t\nhave one?\u201d.\n\n## Step 3: Review & sign\n\nThe final step is your chance to review all of your filled out tax\ninformation. Keeper presents your completed tax return clearly, showing a\ndetailed breakdown of your final refund or tax bill. Here, you can ask as many\nfollowup questions as you\u2019d like. Ultimately, every tax return filed through\nKeeper is reviewed and signed by a tax professional to keep you extra safe.\n\n# Looking ahead\n\nOur 50,000 paying subscribers have loved our first version of 3-Step Filing\nand the reviews have been gushing.
