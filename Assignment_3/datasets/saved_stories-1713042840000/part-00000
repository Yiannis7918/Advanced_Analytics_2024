Reaffirmed\n2023)\n\nCommittee on Obstetric Practice\n\nINTERIM UPDATE: This Committee Opinion is updated as highlighted to reflect a\nlimited, focused change regarding the addition of a report on occupational\nexposure to ionizing radiation.\n\nABSTRACT: In the absence of obstetric or medical complications, occasional air\ntravel is safe for pregnant women. Pregnant women can fly safely, observing\nthe same precautions for air travel as the general population. Because severe\nair turbulence cannot be predicted and the subsequent risk for trauma is\nsignificant should this occur, pregnant women should be instructed to use\ntheir seat belts continuously while seated. Despite a lack of evidence\nassociating lower extremity edema and venous thrombotic events with air travel\nduring pregnancy, certain preventive measures can be used to minimize these\nrisks, including use of support stockings and periodic movement of the lower\nextremities, avoidance of restrictive clothing, occasional ambulation, and\nmaintenance of adequate hydration. For most air travelers, the risks to the\nfetus from exposure to cosmic radiation are negligible. However, aircrew or\nfrequent flyers may exceed these limits. The Federal Aviation Administration\nand the International Commission on Radiological Protection consider aircrew\nto be occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation and recommend that they be\ninformed about radiation exposure and health risks.\n\nOccasional air travel during pregnancy is generally safe. Recent cohort\nstudies suggest no increase in adverse pregnancy outcomes for occasional air\ntravelers 1 2. Most commercial airlines allow pregnant women to fly up to 36\nweeks of gestation. Some restrict pregnant women from international flights\nearlier in gestation and some require documentation of gestational age. For\nspecific airline requirements, women should check with the individual carrier.\nCivilian and military aircrew members who become pregnant should check with\ntheir specific agencies for regulations or restrictions to their flying\nduties.\n\nAir travel is not recommended at any time during pregnancy for women who have\nmedical or obstetric conditions that may be exacerbated by flight or that\ncould require emergency care. The duration of the flight also should be\nconsidered when planning travel. Pregnant women should be informed that the\nmost common obstetric emergencies occur in the first and third trimesters.\n\nIn-craft environmental conditions, such as changes in cabin pressure and low\nhumidity, coupled with the physiologic changes of pregnancy, do result in\nadaptations, including increased heart rate and blood pressure, and a\nsignificant decrease in aerobic capacity 3 4. The risks associated with long\nhours of air travel immobilization and low cabin humidity, such as lower\nextremity edema and venous thrombotic events, recently have been the focus of\nattention for all air travelers. Despite a lack of evidence associating these\nevents with air travel during pregnancy, certain preventive measures can be\nused to minimize these risks, including use of support stockings and periodic\nmovement of the lower extremities, avoidance of restrictive clothing,\noccasional ambulation, and maintenance of adequate hydration.\n\nBecause severe air turbulence cannot be predicted and the subsequent risk for\ntrauma is significant should this occur, pregnant women should be instructed\nto use their seatbelts continuously while seated. The seatbelt should be\nbelted low on the hipbones, between the protuberant abdomen and pelvis.\nSeveral precautions may ease discomfort for pregnant air travelers. For\nexample, gas-producing foods or drinks should be avoided before scheduled\nflights because entrapped gases expand at altitude 5. Preventive antiemetic\nmedication should be considered for women with increased nausea.\n\nAvailable information suggests that noise, vibration, and cosmic radiation\npresent a negligible risk for the occasional pregnant air traveler 6 7. Both\nthe National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements and the\nInternational Commission on Radiological Protection recommend a maximum annual\nradiation exposure limit of 1 millisievert (mSv) (100 rem) for members of the\ngeneral public and 1 mSv over the course of a 40-week pregnancy 7. For most\nair travelers, the risks to the fetus from exposure to cosmic radiation are\nnegligible. Even the longest available intercontinental flights will expose\npassengers to no more than 15% of this limit 7; therefore, it is unlikely that\nthe occasional traveler will exceed current exposure limits during pregnancy.\nHowever, aircrew or frequent flyers may exceed these limits. The Federal\nAviation Administration and the International Commission on Radiological\nProtection consider aircrew to be occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation\nand recommend that they be informed about radiation exposure and health risks\n8 9. The reader is referred to What Aircrews Should Know About Their\nOccupational Exposure to Ionizing Radiation 10 and In-flight Radiation\nExposure 11 for additional details.\n\nIn the absence of obstetric or medical complications, occasional air travel is\nsafe for pregnant women. Pregnant women can fly safely, observing the same\nprecautions for air travel as the general population. Women should check with\nspecific carriers for airline requirements.\n\n## References\n\n  1.
