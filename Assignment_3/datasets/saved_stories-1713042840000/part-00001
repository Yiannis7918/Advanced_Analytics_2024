It can:\n\n  * Browse a network share (FTP only) and play sound media files (almost any format).\n  * Play an entire directory\n  * Fast-forward and rewind, pause and stop\n  * Display cover art from current directory\u2019s cover.jpg, or embedded in media files\n  * Display a VU meter\n  * Stream from online webradios\n  * Display metadata (ID3 tag)\n  * Play videos with sound\n\nRequirements:\n\nWozamp should run on any 64k Apple II with a serial card. In addition to that,\nit requires a surl-server proxy to handle the transcoding and resampling.\nVideo playback requires a 65c02 CPU and two serial ports. Video playback is\nnot yet compatible with the IIgs.\n\nUser manual:\n\nWozamp\u2019s user manual may give you a good idea of what it can do, and how to\nset it up.\n\nScreenshots:\n\nPlaying \u201cJesus built my hotrod\u201d from MinistryBrowsing my\nftp://diskstation.lan/music shareThe welcome screenVideo Wozamp playing the\nMatrix movie\u2019s rooftop fight scene\n\nInstalling the surl-server proxy:\n\nSee the dedicated surl-server page, or this instruction video.\n\nTo play video using Wozamp, you will need to use two serial cables and USB\nserial adapters. The second serial cable should be plugged into the printer\nport (or slot 1), and the corresponding USB adapter is named aux_tty in surl-\nserver\u2019s configuration file. More information about this is available in\nWozamp\u2019s user manual.\n\nTransferring the floppy to your Apple II:\n\nDownload the latest floppy image from the Github Releases page. Use the image\ncorresponding to your Apple II:\n\nApple II model| Floppy image  \n---|---  \n][+, IIe, 6502 CPU with 64kB of RAM| wozamp-oldii.dsk  \nIIgs| wozamp-iigs.dsk  \n//c, //c+, IIe enhanced or platinum, 65c02 CPU with 64 kB of RAM| wozamp.dsk  \n  \nTransfer it to your Apple II using ADTPro (you may prefer the video format)\n\nPlaying music\n\nFor now there are two ways to play music:\n\n  * Input an URL to a music file or stream on the welcome screen, like http://8bit.fm:8000/live. Once the file finished playing or you press Escape, you will be able to enter another URL on the welcome screen.\n  * Input an URL to an FTP directory on the welcome screen. You will then be able to browse the contents of the FTP server, and play files or directories from there.\n  * To make it easy for people with no FTP server available, the surl-server proxy image ships with an anonymous FTP enabled. Navigate to ftp://surl-server/ with a modern computer to put some files in it, and use the same URL in Wozamp.\n\nThe Audiophile metrics\n\nWozamp achieves a very tolerable sound quality thanks to the use of a 11.52kHz\nsampling rate and a state of the art 5-bit DAC. You can enhance the experience\nfurther by replacing your serial cable with a gold-plated serial cable\n(*actual results may vary).\n\nIn the news\n\nHackaday, Korben, ROM-Game\n\nThanks\n\nMany thanks to Oliver Schmidt for his KansasFest presentation of A2Stream,\nwhich made the theory of PWM clear to me. I want to make clear that I did not\ninvent any revolutionary concept here: pulse-width modulation sound has been\nmade long ago, at least since 2005 by Michael J. Mahon, by Oliver with\nA2Stream, by Kris Kennaway with II-Vision.\n\nI think my only innovation is to do it over serial, making it possible to\nstream music from the network with an Apple //c, the one computer in the\nseries with no expansion slot and no way to add an Uthernet card. But I\u2019m not\neven sure. I just wanted to do it.\n\nThanks also to Bits&Terminal Jeff for the very cool name idea and to LeJun for\nthe logo basis!\n\n  * Fran\u00e7ais\n  * English\n\n### Categories\n\n  * Bicycles\n  * Claws Mail\n  * Computers\n  * DIY\n  * Environment\n  * Personal\n  * Pictures\n  * Sysadmin\n  * Uncategorized\n\n### RSS\n\n  * Articles RSS feed\n\n### Social\n\ncolin@colino.net \u00a9 2024.
