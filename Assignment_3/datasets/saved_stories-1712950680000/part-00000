It\u2019s Sheril from Leading Sapiens. Welcome to my newsletter, where I share\nstrategies for getting savvier at the game of work.\n\nPrevious editions ICYMI:\n\n  * Dangerous Assumptions Of Unsuccessful Careers\n\n  * What Truly Counts Need Not Be Measured\n\n##\n\nBees vs Flies\n\n> If you place in a bottle half a dozen bees and the same number of flies, and\n> lay the bottle down horizontally, with its base to the window, you will find\n> that the bees will persist, till they die of exhaustion or hunger, in their\n> endeavor to discover an issue through the glass; while the flies, in less\n> than two minutes, will all have sallied forth through the neck on the\n> opposite side. ...\n>\n> It is their (the bees') love of light, it is their very intelligence, that\n> is their undoing in this experiment. They evidently imagine that the issue\n> from every prison must be there where the light shines clearest; and they\n> act in accordance, and persist in too logical action. To them glass is a\n> supernatural mystery they never have met in nature; they have had no\n> experience of this suddenly impenetrable atmosphere; and the greater their\n> intelligence, the more inadmissible, more incomprehensible, will the strange\n> obstacle appear.\n>\n> Whereas the feather-brained flies, careless of logic as of the enigma of\n> crystal, disregarding the call of the light, flutter wildly hither and\n> thither, and meeting here the good fortune that often waits on the simple,\n> who find salvation there where the wiser will perish, necessarily end by\n> discovering the friendly opening that restores their liberty to them.\n>\n> \u2014 Maurice Maeterlinck in The Life of the Bee cited by Karl Weick\n\nI\u2019m not sure how accurate or repeatable this experiment is, but I have seen\nthis pattern often enough both in myself and others to attest that this is\nequally applicable to us humans.\n\nThe so called intelligent \u201cbee\u201d types overthink and restrict themselves while\nthe not-so-smart \u201cfly\u201d types keep trying different things until something\nworks.\n\n##\n\nSome patterns to consider\n\n####\n\n\u2734\ufe0f Security of the crowd\n\nThe more similar your actions are to the rest of the crowd, the more similar\nyour results. A very different approach, while seemingly risky, can also lead\nto dramatically different results. We obsess about the potential downside\nwithout giving enough consideration to the upside.\n\n####\n\n\u2734\ufe0f Success restricts\n\nPrevious successes and current skills make us think in a restricted way, which\nblinds us to other options. New efforts and different outcomes require\nlearning new terministic screens; aka a new language and vocabulary in a\ndomain.\n\n####\n\n\u2734\ufe0f Knowhow vs \u201cdo-how\u201d\n\nA common mistake is to think that all actions require considered reasoning. We\nput an onus on pre-knowing. The logic goes something like \u201cto do something, I\nneed to know how first\u201d. But you often have to do something BEFORE you can\nknow how to. The knowing happens through the doing. This is why real learning\nis painful, and why we resist it.\n\n####\n\n\u2734\ufe0f Leaning in vs leaning out\n\nWhen dealing with large amounts of change and uncertainty, the tendency is to\ndouble-down upon what we already know. While this might be reassuring, it\u2019s\nnot always optimal. Random experiments while seemingly suboptimal can be the\nmost efficient. This is also how we keep pushing the envelope of our skills\nand capabilities.\n\n####\n\n\u2734\ufe0f The value of crises\n\nSeeming headaches and inconveniences are also opportunities for growth and\nlearning new skills. This is not about \u201cpositive thinking\u201d but instead\nunderstanding the very nature of how growth happens. While crises don\u2019t make\nfor fun times, they also build a new set of skills, bring a team together, and\ngive you something to talk about.\n\n####\n\n\u2734\ufe0f Staying naive\n\nThe curse of expertise is that the more you know how to make something work,\nthe more you also know how something will NOT in fact work. This is how\nexperts over time turn into cynics and why maintaining your naivet\u00e9 is key to\nlong-term success.\n\n####\n\n\u2734\ufe0f Persistence vs flexibility\n\nPersistence is a virtue, but so is being flexible and knowing when to change\ntactics. Emerson put it more bluntly:\n\n> A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little\n> statesmen and philosophers and divines.\n\n####\n\n\u2734\ufe0f Experimenting to adapt\n\nAdaptation by definition means we do not know what\u2019s going to work beforehand.\nThis means being smart about running as many experiments as we can. It\u2019s the\ndifference between small bets vs betting the farm.\n\n##\n\nQuestions for reflection\n\n  * How\u2019s your expertise blinding you to different options?\n\n  * Are you trying enough dumb things?\n\n  * What stage is your project at? Does it require convergent (bees) thinking, or could you use more of a divergent (flies) approach?\n\n  * Do your systems allow for any \u201cfoolish\u201d or random behavior?\n\n  * Is there enough variety in your approaches to allow for serendipitous success? Or are you trying to script it to the tee?\n\n  * How is past success restricting today\u2019s possibilities?\n\n  * Are you optimizing for cleverness or effectiveness? The two are not always correlated.\n\n##\n\nRelated reading\n\nBelow are some additional pieces that explore different aspects:\n\n  * Tetris is a more apt metaphor than chess for how we approach strategy in daily life.\n\n  * The deliberate amateur.\n\n  * The oblique vs direct approach to goals.\n\nThat does it for this edition.
