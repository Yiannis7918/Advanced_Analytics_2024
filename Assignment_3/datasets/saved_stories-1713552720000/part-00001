It is important to acknowledge, however, that though\ncopyleft can be found at the opposite end of an axis with respect to\npermissive, it is not synonymous with the linguistic antonym of permissive \u2013\nthat is, copyleft licenses are not \u201crestrictive\u201d by comparison with permissive\nlicenses.\n\nAside: Free software is not synonymous with copyleft and open source is not\nsynonymous with permissive, though this is a common misconception. Permissive\nlicenses are generally free software and copyleft licenses are generally open\nsource; the distinction between permissive and copyleft is orthogonal to the\ndistinction between free software and open source.\n\nIt is a common misunderstanding to construe copyleft licenses as more\n\u201crestrictive\u201d or \u201cless free\u201d than permissive licenses. This view is predicated\non a shallow understanding of freedom, a sort of passive freedom that presents\nas the absence of obligations. Copyleft is predicated on a deeper\nunderstanding of freedom in which freedom is a positive guarantee of\nrights.^[source]\n\nLet\u2019s consider the matter of freedom, obligation, rights, and restrictions in\ndepth.\n\nBoth forms of licenses include obligations, which are not the same thing as\nrestrictions. An example of an obligation can be found in the permissive MIT\nlicense:\n\n> Permission is hereby granted [...] to deal in the Software without\n> restriction [...] subject to the following conditions:\n>\n> The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\n> all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nThis obliges the user, when distributing copies of the software, to include\nthe copyright notice. However, it does not restrict the use of the software\nunder any conditions. An example of a restriction comes from the infamous JSON\nlicense, which adds the following clause to a stock MIT license:\n\n> The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil.\n\nIBM famously petitioned Douglas Crockford for, and received, a license to do\nevil with JSON.^1 This kind of clause is broadly referred to in the free\nsoftware jargon as \u201cdiscrimination against field of endeavour\u201d, and such\nrestrictions contravene both the free software and open source definitions. To\nquote the Open Source Definition, clause 6:\n\n> The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a\n> specific field of endeavor. For example, it may not restrict the program\n> from being used in a business, or from being used for genetic research.\n\nNo such restrictions are found in free or open source software licenses, be\nthey permissive or copyleft \u2013 all FOSS licenses permit the use of the software\nfor any purpose without restriction. You can sell both permissive and copyleft\nsoftware, use it as part of a commercial cloud service,^2 use the software as\npart of a nuclear weapons program,^3 or do whatever else you want with it.\nThere are no restrictions on how free software is used, regardless of if it is\npermissive or copyleft.\n\nCopyleft does not impose restrictions, but it does impose obligations. The\nobligations exist to guarantee rights to the users of the software \u2013 in other\nwords, to ensure freedoms. In this respect copyleft licenses are more free\nthan permissive licenses.\n\nFreedom is a political concept, and in order to understand this, we must\nconsider it in political terms, which is to say as an exercise in power\ndynamics. Freedom without obligation is a contradiction. Freedom emerges from\nobligations, specifically obligations imposed on power.\n\nWhere does freedom come from?\n\nConsider the United States as an example, a society which sets forth freedom\nas a core political value.^4 Freedoms in the US are ultimately grounded in the\nUS constitution and its bill of rights. These tools create freedoms by\nguaranteeing rights to US citizens through the imposition of obligations on\nthe government. For instance, you have a right to an attorney when accused of\na crime in the United States, and as such the government is obliged to provide\nyou with one. It is from obligations such as these that freedom emerges.\nFreedom of assembly, another example, is guaranteed such that the police are\nprevented from breaking up peaceful protests \u2013 this freedom emerges from a\nconstraint (or restriction, if you must) on power (the government) as a means\nof guaranteeing the rights and freedom of those with less power by comparison\n(its citizens).\n\nWho holds the power in the context of software?\n\nConsider non-free software by contrast: software is written by corporations\nand sold on to users with substantial restrictions on its use. Corporations\nhold more power than individuals: they have more resources (e.g. money), more\ninfluence, and, in a sense more fundamental to the software itself, they\nretain in private the tools to understand the software, or to modify its\nbehavior, and they dictate the conditions under which it may be used (e.g.\nonly if your license key has not expired, or only for certain purposes). This\nis true of anyone who retains the source code in private and uses copyright\nlaw to enforce their will upon the software \u2013 in this way they possess, and\nexercise, power over the user.\n\nPermissive licenses do not provide any checks on this power; generally they\npreserve moral rights and little else. Permissive licenses provide for\nrelatively few and narrow freedoms, and are not particularly \u201cfree\u201d as such.\nCopyleft licenses constrain these powers through additional obligations, and\nfrom these obligations greater freedoms emerge. Specifically, they oblige\nreciprocity. They are distinguished from permissive licenses in this manner,\nbut where permissive licenses permit, copyleft does not restrict per-se \u2013\nbetter terms might be \u201creciprocal\u201d and \u201cnon-reciprocal\u201d, but perhaps that ship\nhas sailed. \u201cYou may use this software if ...\u201d is a statement made both by\npermissive and copyleft licenses, with different ifs. Neither form of license\nsays \u201cyou cannot use this software if ...\u201d; licenses which do so are non-free.\n\nPermissive licenses and copyleft licenses are both free software, but only the\nlatter provides a guarantee of rights, and while both might be free only the\nlatter provides freedom.\n\n  1. Strictly speaking this exception was for JSLint, not JSON. But I digress. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  2. This is even true if the software uses the AGPL license. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  3. Take a moment here to entertain the supposition that nuclear warheads are legally obliged to include a copy of the MIT license, if they incorporate MIT licensed code in their guidance systems, on board, as they are \u201cdistributing\u201d that software to the, err, recipients. As it were. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  4. The extent to which it achieves this has, of course, been the subject of intense debate for centuries. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n## Articles from blogs I read Generated by openring\n\n#### Status update, April 2024\n\nHi!
