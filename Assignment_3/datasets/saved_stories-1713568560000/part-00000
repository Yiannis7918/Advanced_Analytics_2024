And Mayor Richard Francis goes so far as\nto call it \u201can absurd waste of money.\u201d But, long shot or not, the iceberg\nstudy has the official blessing of the Ventura City Council.\n\nThe idea of hauling icebergs from the frigid waters of Antarctica or the North\nAtlantic is an old one now being refloated only in the face of the chilling\npolitical realities: California\u2019s four-year drought is dragging on and water\nsupplies are dwindling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe iceberg study is to be one focus of a $175,000 research project on\npossible long-term water supplies approved by the City Council Monday on a 5-2\nvote.\n\nAccording to City Engineer Ron Caulkins, getting an iceberg to Ventura would\ninvolve hiring a large oceangoing tug that would have to anchor into an\niceberg somewhere thousands of miles from the county and then tow it slowly\nback to a local anchorage.\n\nOne of the many problems to be overcome would be the danger of the iceberg\nmelting along the way. But Caulkins said that could be solved.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d have to wrap the iceberg with a diaper or collecting device to collect\nthe melted iceberg water, and the water would be transported onshore by ship\nor pipeline,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile The Times was unable this week to track down any city in the world that\nhas ever added to its water supply by using portable icebergs, the idea of\ntowing icebergs has popped up with some frequency in the past.\n\nNobody could remember this week exactly who first proposed it to the Ventura\nCity Council, but Councilwoman Cathy Bean, a member of the city water ad hoc\ncommittee that prepared the scope of work, said she asked that the iceberg\nstudy be included after residents brought the subject up during City Council\nmeetings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want anybody to say that we didn\u2019t look into all possible\nalternatives,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWater from Icebergs\u201d is the fifth item on the list of eight alternatives,\nahead of agricultural runoff, storm water runoff and wells, but behind\nimported state water, a dam on Sespe Creek, desalinated seawater and water\nfrom Canada via supertanker.\n\nEven though it\u2019s not high on the list of possibilities, the two council\nmembers who voted against the iceberg alternative say it\u2019s a needless waste of\ntaxpayer money, and most experts seem to agree.\n\n\u201cIn the late \u201860s there was a symposium in Saudi Arabia to study the\npossibility, and the main conclusion was that the idea was not practical,\u201d\nsaid Bob Kriddel, a hydrologist at the ice and climate office of the U.S.\nGeological Center in Tacoma, Wash.\n\nIt\u2019s even more impractical in Southern California, Kriddel said, because the\nWest Coast has something of a shortage of good icebergs. He said Alaska \u201cdoes\nnot have any icebergs of any scale to speak of, so you would have to haul the\nicebergs in from Greenland or Antarctica across tropical waters.\n\n\u201cThe consensus is that when you\u2019re talking Southern California, it just isn\u2019t\npractical. The iceberg would be long gone before it reaches its destination.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoug Priest, manager of the State Drought Center in Sacramento, said the\niceberg project has been studied by state experts but quickly discarded.\n\n\u201cPeople have looked at that in just about every drought we\u2019ve had, but they\nhaven\u2019t been able to show that it\u2019s economically feasible or even more\nreasonable than other alternatives.\n\nBesides, he said, transporting icebergs would create a serious logistical\nproblem: \u201cOnce you get those things started, how do you stop them?\u201d\n\nEven in Alaska, where ice abounds and rainfall is no problem, the idea of\nbeing the iceberg supplier to Ventura arouses little enthusiasm.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a wild, wild scheme,\u201d said Ron Crawford, chairman of the geography\ndepartment at the University of Alaska at Anchorage. \u201cThe Japanese buy some\nglacial water to use it in cocktail parties as kind of a luxury item, but\nthat\u2019s about it. There\u2019s lots of ice here, but if you want my opinion, trying\nto send it down to Southern California is a silly idea.\u201d\n\nBack home, Francis, who voted against funding the study, said he can hardly\nbelieve that the city is spending money studying icebergs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an absurd waste of money,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Saudis have been studying it\nfor years and they have so much money they don\u2019t even know what to do with it.\nYou\u2019re talking about essentially dragging a swimming pool full of water with a\nchunk of ice on top of it.\u201d\n\nVice Mayor Don Villeneuve, who is also a member of the water subcommittee,\nsays he still thinks it\u2019s worth a look.\n\n\u201cIf all the iceberg studies have been done, then fine,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will only\ntake our consultant a day, or even a few hours, to look into it and discard it\nas an alternative. I don\u2019t see the harm in making sure that we take a look at\nevery possible alternative.\u201d\n\n### More to Read\n\n  * For Subscribers\n\n### A celebrated L.A. astrology influencer\u2019s stunning fall from \u2018healer\u2019 to\nsolar eclipse killer\n\nApril 19, 2024\n\n  * ### Topanga Canyon could remain closed into the fall after massive landslide\n\nApril 19, 2024\n\n  * ### \u2018Help me, help me\u2019: Metro bus driver stabbed, reviving fears about safety\n\nApril 17, 2024\n\nCalifornia\n\n### More From the Los Angeles Times\n\n  * California\n\n### Murrieta board defies state, will keep policy to tell parents about LGBTQ+\ntransitioning\n\n2 hours ago\n\n  * California\n\n### Body of unidentified man washes ashore on Ventura County beach\n\n2 hours ago\n\n  * California\n\n### Bad tattoo?
