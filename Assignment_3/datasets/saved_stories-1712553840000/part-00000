Photo: Jeff Brown\n\nThis article was featured in One Great Story, New York\u2019s reading\nrecommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly.\n\nChristopher Rim makes himself hard to get to. First, there\u2019s the email to\nregister as a guest at the Aman Club, where members pay an initiation fee of\n$200,000 to perch themselves above the crowds on Fifth Avenue and where Rim\nsometimes holds his client meetings. Then there\u2019s the check-in at the front\ndesk to get access to the elevator, which leads to another reception area on\nthe 14th floor. From there, a man in a suit guides me into the main room\n(fireplace, lots of couches, mostly empty), then through a door that blends\ninto a wall, past a bar (one guy drinking water; it\u2019s only noon), and up a\nnarrow flight of stairs. It\u2019s there that I meet Rim in a small room decorated\nwith bottles of Macallan 18 and coffee-table books about art.\n\nHis look is quiet luxury, though everything about this meeting appears\ndesigned to scream money. On his wrist: a $55,000 Patek Philippe watch. On his\nback: a Loro Piana cashmere sweater. Rim tells me that sometimes he runs into\nhis clients here and they pretend not to know him. But he can imagine what\nthey\u2019re thinking: What is the tutor doing at the same club where Bill Gates\nlunched when he was in town?\n\nFor the past nine years, Rim, 28, has been working as an \u201cindependent\neducation consultant,\u201d helping the one percent navigate the increasingly\ncompetitive college-admissions process \u2014 the current round of which ends in\nFebruary. He started by editing college essays from his Yale dorm room for $50\nan hour but now charges the parents of his company\u2019s 190 clients \u2014 mostly\nprivate-school kids, many of them in New York \u2014 $120,000 a year to help them\ncreate a narrative he believes will appeal to college-admissions officers.\nThat company, Command Education, currently has 41 full-time staffers, most of\nwhom are recent graduates of top-tier colleges and universities. The pitch is\ncrafted to appeal to the wealthy clients Rim courts: a \u201cpersonalized, white\nglove\u201d service, through which Command employees do everything from curating\nstudents\u2019 extracurriculars to helping them land summer internships, craft\nessays, and manage their course loads with the single goal of getting them in.\n\n## Cover Story\n\n## How\u2019s a Rich Kid Supposed to Get Into College These Days?\n\n\u201cWe are texting students, I think it\u2019s like 15 minutes before their math\nclass, to make sure they are turning in their homework,\u201d says Rim, who in\ninterviews is soft-spoken, polite, and confident, occasionally dropping into\nthe demeanor of a start-up bro. Most clients start with Command in the ninth\nor tenth grade, but a small percentage begin in middle school.\n\nBusiness is good. The Independent Educational Consultants Association\nestimates that up to 25,000 full- and part-time IECs will be working in the\nU.S. this year, and the market-research firm IBISWorld estimates it to be a\n$2.9 billion industry \u2014 up from $400 million just a decade ago. Most\nconsultants charge in the ballpark of $4,000 to $7,500 for helping students\nwith typical application prep, including making their college list and looking\nover their essays, but Rim operates in the uppermost echelon. In certain\ncircles in Manhattan and Brooklyn, \u201ceveryone is charging six figures,\u201d says a\nparent who hired Command for her teen. In a recent survey, one-third of Horace\nMann high-schoolers copped to working with a private consultant, but multiple\nparents with kids in city private schools estimate that number to be much\nhigher. Rim says he has a waiting list.\n\nRim\u2019s promise \u2014 that he will give kids a road map to getting into one of their\ntop-choice colleges \u2014 is particularly appealing in this moment as the\nconventional wisdom about who gets into selective colleges and why is\nchanging, setting off confusion and anxiety for those who are used to their\nprivilege giving them a VIP pass. Legacy admissions, which have always favored\nthe rich, are under increased scrutiny; some universities have done away with\nthem altogether. The threshold for a donation that might move the needle has\nreportedly reached $10 million. Pricey SAT and ACT courses and tutors are also\nless effective since many schools \u2014 even competitive ones \u2014 no longer require\ntest scores.\n\nThere are lots of permutations to his clients\u2019 parental anxiety, all of which\nseem soothed by throwing money at the problem. Many of Command\u2019s charges go to\nelite private schools, but the stress isn\u2019t exclusively theirs. Rim says\nparents who can afford private school but send their kids to one of the city\u2019s\ntop public schools instead feel a burden to prove they haven\u2019t disadvantaged\ntheir child. \u201cThey tell me, \u2018Oh, my friends think I\u2019m such a bad mom because\nI\u2019m not paying for private-school tuition,\u2019 \u201d he says. Or worse, he adds,\ntheir social set thinks they can\u2019t afford it. He says he sees the same thing\nwith parents of kids at what he calls \u201csecond tier\u201d private schools \u2014 which\nhe\u2019s diplomatic enough not to name.\n\nAnd so to numb their nerves, they hire a consultant. Even as colleges and\nuniversities claim to be working toward fairer admissions, they don\u2019t prohibit\npaying a third party to help with applications; most don\u2019t even discourage the\npractice. So while consultants can be viewed as predatory, profiting from the\nanxieties of parents and their stressed-out offspring, they aren\u2019t breaking\nany rules. In a survey of Harvard\u2019s class of 2027, 23 percent of respondents\nsaid they had worked with a private college consultant. The gap widens once\nincome is considered: About 30 percent of respondents from families earning\nhalf a million dollars or more per year hired a consultant, compared with just\n6 to 7 percent of respondents from homes with incomes of $125,000 or less.\n\nRim says that over the past five years, 94 percent of Command clients have\nbeen accepted to one of their top-three schools, including Harvard, Yale,\nPrinceton, Columbia, the University of Pennsylvania, Dartmouth, Cornell,\nBrown, Stanford, and MIT \u2014 a statistic that appears in bold on the company\u2019s\nwebsite. It\u2019s an impressive number and one that\u2019s impossible to verify,\nleaving just enough cushion to give prospective clients confidence without\nmaking guarantees. (Although since Command helps clients pick their schools,\nthose lists also reflect what their mentors think is within reach.) Many of\nRim\u2019s competitors post similar statistics, despite the IECA\u2019s advice against\nmaking such claims.\n\nStudent success is also hard to verify because so few people who use a\nconsultant are willing to talk about it. The Command website features three\ncase studies, but when I ask Rim to put me in touch with any of these clients\n\u2014 their names and photos are right on the website, after all \u2014 he concedes\nthey are stock images and fake names. He notes the disclaimer at the bottom of\nthe web page, which in gray type over a gray background reads, \u201cSome details\nhave been changed to protect student privacy\u201d (since that phone call, the\ndisclaimer has been updated with more specifics), but says the stories behind\nthem are real.\n\nSome of the secrecy is due to parents\u2019 not wanting to admit their child\u2019s\nprecociousness was coached, or perhaps they sense there\u2019s something at least\nunbecoming and even ethically dubious about spending exorbitant amounts of\nmoney to boost their already privileged children\u2019s chances of getting into an\nelite college.\n\nThe reticence, according to Rim, may also be owed to the consultants\nthemselves being such a coveted resource. He told Bloomberg last year that a\nparent at Trinity School in Manhattan once offered him $1.5 million not to\nwork with any other student in his kid\u2019s class. (Rim says when he declined the\noffer, the parent joked that he should just buy the company from him.) He says\nclients often save his number in their phones under a fake name, and it\u2019s\ncommon for them to have him sign an NDA. None would talk with their name\nattached for this article.\n\nA Command client with a child at a well-known private school in the city says\na weirdness kicks in among parents around the eighth grade, which is when she\nhired Command. \u201cI have amazing friends that I\u2019ve been there with for however\nmany years,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we\u2019re not talking about what consultant we\u2019re\nusing, what summer programs the kids are going to do, anything. And I\u2019m\ntalking very close, like you vacation with these people and you\u2019re friends\nwith these people. There\u2019s a shift that happens, and it\u2019s very subtle. The\nconversation about camp becomes like, \u2018What are they doing before and after?\u2019\nBut no one really talks about the summer programs until summer is there\nbecause then it\u2019s too late for other people to apply.\u201d\n\nRim says his clients include big swingers in finance and the CEOs of \u201cmajor,\nmajor, major household-name brands.\u201d He says they try to incentivize him the\nsame way they might try to motivate their employees: \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018If my kid\ndoes very well, Chris, I\u2019m going to bring you 20 more students. I know\neverybody in the Chinese American community at Horace Mann. I know all the\nIndian American families at Stuyvesant. I will double your business, Chris.\u2019\n\u2018Chris, once my kid gets in, you\u2019re going to have to work even harder because\nI\u2019m about to bring you 500 more students.\u2019\u201d He laughs. \u201cI had a parent say\nthat.\u201d\n\nRim tells me that before he arrived at the Aman that day, he had been with a\nspecial client \u2014 one of the few he meets with in person now that his company\nhas gone virtual. He says they paid him $10,000 for a 45-minute \u201cdownload\u201d\nabout the latest trends in college admissions. It\u2019s hard not to be skeptical\nof such an absurd number, and he offers it unprompted. Rim is a master self-\npromoter; I imagine he thinks it will get him more business. He may be right.\nOne of his key talents is knowing how to spin a story. It\u2019s what he did for\nhimself and now what Command Education does for its clients.\n\nCommand offers tutoring, but the real selling point is its \u201cmentors\u201d \u2014\n20-somethings who earn $100,000 to $200,000 a year by being on call for their\nteenage mentees at all hours. (The base salary is $55,000 to $72,000, but Rim\nsays mentors receive bonuses for getting clients into one of their top-choice\nschools as well as for retaining clients year after year.) There are no\nofficial requirements for working with a Command mentor, according to Ali\nMantell, the company\u2019s vice-president of enrollment. \u201cWe are not just choosing\nthe valedictorian so that we can inflate our results,\u201d she says. \u201cBut Command\nonly takes on a small number of students from a particular school each year\nbecause we don\u2019t want to compete with ourselves. We don\u2019t want to necessarily\nwork with students that have the same interests, similar GPA profile, all the\nsame classes, applying to the same schools.\u201d\n\nOnce parents sign a contract (\u201c\u2018Our services are strictly advisory.\u2019 We say\nthat 100 times in the contract. It\u2019s like you\u2019re hiring McKinsey,\u201d says Rim),\nthere\u2019s an initial consultation, and after that, a client typically meets with\na mentor one hour a week over Zoom. \u201cThen if we need to go to two, three, four\nhours a week, we need to have half-hour meetings two times a week, three times\na week \u2014 we\u2019re fully able and willing to do that,\u201d says Gabe Cramer, who\noversees the company\u2019s mentors. Those mentors assign their clients weekly\ntasks, he explains, which can vary in intensity depending on how close that\nstudent is to the application process. Mentors are expected to be available to\ntheir clients from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. each day and a minimum of six additional\nhours a week outside that window.\n\nSome meetings are \u201croad map\u201d sessions, in which a mentor and a client plot out\nthe next few months \u2014 deciding what internships or awards to apply to, for\nexample. Others sound almost like therapy. Cramer gives an example of coaching\na student who isn\u2019t connecting with a teacher in a particular class. He says\nwhen it comes to essays, \u201cediting is a big part of it, but it starts even\nbefore then.\u201d Mentors help their clients generate ideas: \u201cWe are talking to\nthem about, \u2018Hey, remember that opportunity that you had last summer, and you\ntold me about this amazing conversation you had with your brother?\u2019 Or, \u2018You\ntalked to me about the fact that you just had dinner with this person in local\ngovernment and it helped you see something that you hadn\u2019t seen before.\u2019 \u201d If\na student isn\u2019t a strong writer, he says, sometimes they workshop the essays\nverbally. Mentors also prep clients for interviews: \u201cWe have some people on\nour team who have been interviewers for their respective universities, and\nwe\u2019ll often call them in to do mock interviews to ask the questions that are\nactually going to be asked of them.\u201d\n\nMentors plot out a testing strategy. Some students take the SAT as early as\ntheir freshman year, says Rim, to get it out of the way. \u201cI want 1560 or\nhigher,\u201d he says. (Rim declines to tell me his own score but says it was \u201cnot\nperfect.\u201d) Even though some colleges are test optional, Rim says, \u201cif you\u2019re\napplying from any of these private schools here, you have to take it. Imagine\nyou\u2019re the only one who doesn\u2019t take it and everyone else has.\u201d Additionally,\nCommand helps connect clients with professors at universities of interest to\noffer assistance with research projects; mentors edit the emails. (A cottage\nindustry has developed of intermediaries who, for roughly $3,000 to $9,000,\nwill put high-school students in touch with Ph.D. candidates or professors to\npad their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. Rim says that Command does not pay for its clients\u2019\nresearch positions.)\n\nThe base of its formula is what Command calls the \u201cpassion project\u201d \u2014 the\nspecialty it helps students develop so they become what counselors call\n\u201cpointy\u201d kids rather than well-rounded ones. Rim and other college counselors\npush the message that being captain of the debate team, a varsity soccer\ngoalie, and class president is the kind of gold star that isn\u2019t that special.\nSchools, they say, are looking for highly specialized students who demonstrate\na specific talent or passion. (The oft-repeated quote is that colleges don\u2019t\nwant well-rounded students so much as \u201ca well-rounded class.\u201d)\n\nThe theme of the passion project becomes what Cramer calls the \u201chook\u201d that\nhangs their essays and lists of extracurriculars together. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to\nplay the violin, be the first chair in your state, and rescue the whales. You\ncan just pick one and be so good at it that you want to dare the admissions\nofficers not to accept you and that they will regret it,\u201d says Rim. No matter\nwhat, \u201cwe will find the story.\u201d\n\nRim insists Command mentors don\u2019t fabricate a kid\u2019s interests but merely draw\nthem out. Here\u2019s an example offered by Cramer, who says a lot of clients are\ninterested in business or finance: \u201cOne of the things that we push them to do\nis try to understand, What about finance? What about business? What are you\ntrying to do in the world? And if they say, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019ve traveled around with\nmy family a lot, I see the natural beauty of the places I\u2019ve been around,\u2019 we\nstart to show them, \u2018Well, actually what it sounds like you\u2019re maybe starting\nto talk about a little is this idea of investing in green technologies and\ntrying to use private industry as a way to be more environmentally conscious,\nand we should be investing in emerging technologies.\u2019 You don\u2019t know any of\nthis stuff as a 14- or 15-year-old, but you\u2019re kind of talking about that.\u201d\n\nA Command client who is a senior at a private Manhattan high school and was\nrecently admitted to an Ivy League school describes a similar process. She\nsays her mentor helped her start a blog related to her desired major and\nedited her posts. \u201cAll my activities, the internship I did last summer, the\nblog, what I wrote about in my essays, it was all focused on that,\u201d she says.\n\u201cIt really was what I was interested in and what I probably would have pursued\nanyway, but I wouldn\u2019t have done so much focus on it if it wasn\u2019t Command\nsaying to me, \u2018This is how you\u2019re going to get into college: Make sure you let\nthem know what you want to do.\u2019 \u201d She says the blog is mostly stagnant now.\n\nMentors also serve as mediators between kids and their parents, helping\nstudents deliver news of a bad grade or navigate an argument. They coach\nstudents on starting their own businesses and nonprofits, too. Rim says one\ntime a client of his appeared on Shark Tank and Command helped him perfect his\npitch. Another decided her passion was makeup tutorials, and Rim\u2019s team\nprovided marketing and web design for her YouTube channel. \u201cThat\u2019s not\ncheating,\u201d he says. \u201cShe could go and hire someone from Fiverr\u201d to do the same\nthing.\n\nAll this must be boiled down into a college application that typically\nincludes a 650-word personal statement or a handful of 200-word Q&As, a high-\nschool transcript, some recommendation letters, and test scores (maybe).\n\nRim didn\u2019t discover the advantage of specializing: The high-school students\nwho have found a place at the best colleges (without legacy admissions or\ntheir family name on a wing) are often the pointier kids, and there have long\nbeen people engineering that pointiness. Kat Cohen, founder of IvyWise, a\nCommand competitor, has been at this game for more than 25 years. She tells me\nshe once took a junior-varsity swimmer with an interest in engineering and\nturned him into a mini-expert on everything aquatic \u2014 volunteering for clean-\nwater nonprofits, screening documentaries about the fresh-water crisis, and\ndesigning boats in his bathtub. She had him quit the debate team and join the\nrobotics club and says he was ultimately accepted to an Ivy.\n\nBut while educational consulting itself isn\u2019t new, the level of hand-holding\noffered and the price tag attached have skyrocketed, in tandem with the\npressure parents feel to do everything in their power to give their kids every\nadvantage. These parents hear the message that their privileged children are\nnow in trouble. Admissions officers\u2019 priorities have changed. Colleges and\nuniversities, sheepish that their decadeslong efforts to make college more\nmeritocratic have largely failed, have increased efforts to recruit from rural\nareas, attract more first-generation students, and eliminate financial\nbarriers to entry. (Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, and Yale, among other\nuniversities, offer free tuition for students from families earning under\n$75,000 to under $150,000 a year, depending on the school.) And with test\nscores no longer a gate through which all applicants must pass, colleges have\nmore leeway to design a class to their liking.\n\nThese same parents tend to ignore the data that shows that being rich in and\nof itself is still a golden ticket. A damning analysis published last year\nfound that kids of the one percent were 34 percent more likely to get into\nelite universities than other applicants with similar SAT or ACT scores and\nthat students from families in the top 0.1 percent were more than twice as\nlikely to be admitted. The recent Supreme Court decision ending affirmative\naction is expected to benefit white and Asian students at the expense of Black\nand Latinx students. Stressing that he is drawing from conversations with his\ncolleagues at other institutions and not just his own school, Adam Exline,\ndirector of college counseling at Trevor Day School, a private school in\nManhattan that costs up to $62,500 per year, says that \u201cif anything, the\nSCOTUS decision sort of has made families, especially affluent families that\ncan afford multitudes of test prep and tutors and everything else, feel like,\nOh, well, that\u2019s good for us because now fewer non-numeric factors can be\nconsidered.\u201d\n\nCanh Oxelson, executive director of college counseling at Horace Mann, who\nformerly worked in admissions at the University of Pennsylvania, notes there\u2019s\na particular irony to a consultant working with the most financially\nadvantaged teenagers. \u201cOf course the IEC is going to accept that family as a\nclient. They know as well as I do the kid\u2019s going to get in no matter what.\nThe kid could draw circles on a piece of paper for an essay and they\u2019re still\ngetting in. I\u2019m amazed at the families who do it. I think, Why did you do\nthat? I guess if you have that much money, it\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d\n\nPut all those connected families with money in one school, however, and the\nplaying field starts to feel uncomfortably level again. \u201cYou think you did it\nright: My kid got into a good private school. You\u2019re on that path and so you\nthink you\u2019re fine. Then middle school hits and then suddenly you start to hear\nthe back chatter of all your friends who already have high-school kids on how\nchallenging it is and all these things you need to do,\u201d says a Command client.\n\u201cAnd now you yourself are like, What are you going to do differently? It\u2019s an\never-changing environment, and it\u2019s supercompetitive, and so you hire a\ncounselor just to help you continue with whatever edge you have.\u201d\n\nThe fact that a public-school kid from Paramus, New Jersey, who has never set\nfoot in a college-admissions office has convinced the upper tiers of New York\nsociety to pay him hundreds of thousands of dollars to help their already\nwell-connected children get into college is proof of Rim\u2019s hustle. His story\nstarts on the western side of the Hudson River. The son of an attorney and a\nsubstitute teacher, Rim was a good but not stellar student at a magnet school.\nHe knew nothing of the private schools 40 minutes away in Manhattan, much less\nabout the students who occupied them.\n\nRim, as he tells it, was the underdog. He says when he was a high-school\njunior, his guidance counselor told him he would never get into an Ivy League\nuniversity and he should save money by going to a state school. Even now, Rim\ntells the story with a chip on his shoulder. \u201cI think when someone is saying\nthat I can\u2019t do something, I want to prove them wrong,\u201d he says. Against his\ncounselor\u2019s advice, he applied to Yale and was accepted, \u201cbeating out the\nvaledictorian,\u201d he notes.\n\nFor Rim, his pointy narrative was that he was a young person dedicated to\npublic service. As a sophomore, he founded a nonprofit, It Ends Today, talking\nto middle-school students about bullying. The idea behind it was that tweens\nand teens would listen to students slightly older than they are. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an\nadult speaking to them,\u201d says Rim. \u201cWe were like their older-brother, older-\nsister type of figure.\u201d (Rim says he didn\u2019t experience much bullying himself.)\n\nSpeaking as president of anti-bullying nonprofit It Ends Today, which fizzled\nout when Rim matriculated at Yale. Photo: Courtesy of Luce Foundation\n\nHe showed an early knack for raising his organization\u2019s profile \u2014 and his own.\nWhen Rim heard that Lady Gaga\u2019s Born This Way Foundation was hosting an anti-\nbullying event with Oprah Winfrey, he cold-called Harvard\u2019s Berkman Center, a\nsponsor of the event, to get an invite. He leveraged that into local press\ncoverage and eventually landed a position on Born This Way\u2019s youth advisory\nboard. He convinced Perez Hilton to make a video supporting It Ends Today\nafter tracking down the celebrity blogger at a book signing. After Rim was\nrecognized by the James Jay Dudley Luce Foundation, a New York\u2013based nonprofit\nspotlighting public service, its president wrote what was essentially a public\nletter of recommendation for him in the Huffington Post\u2019s now-defunct open-\ncontributor platform with the headline \u201cAnti-Bullying Hero Hopes for Harvard.\u201d\n\nMuch like high-school students padding out their applications, Rim has\npolished some of his accolades to high shine. On the Command website and his\npersonal website, in his Medium bio and to the press, Rim describes himself as\nthe recipient of \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s Lifetime Achievement Award,\u201d which sounds\nimpressive but isn\u2019t exactly the Medal of Freedom. The award is more commonly\ncalled the President\u2019s Volunteer Service Award, for which any U.S. citizen\nover the age of 5 who has completed a designated number of hours of community\nservice can apply. If accepted, volunteers receive a certificate and form\nletter from the president. Rim\u2019s 4,000 hours put him in the Lifetime\nAchievement Award category, above gold, silver, and bronze.\n\nRim has also said he sold a tutoring company he founded in eighth grade called\nPrestige Review Group to \u201ca Shanghai-based consulting firm.\u201d When asked about\nit now, he brushes it off as a small project in which he tutored \u201c30 clients\nor so\u201d \u2014 fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-graders \u2014 for $20 to $30 an hour and says\nhe gave the proceeds to charity. He clarifies that he was connected to the\nbuyer through a family friend and that it was really the worksheets and other\nstudy materials he developed that he\u2019d sold, but he says he can\u2019t give more\ndetails because he signed an NDA.\n\nRim last filed a report for It Ends Today the same month he started at Yale\nand says the nonprofit fizzled out by his sophomore year. By then, he was\nreceiving calls from parents of students at his former high school wanting to\nknow how they could get their children into a top school without perfect\ngrades and test scores. Rim initially gave advice for free, then moved into\nediting college essays for a fee \u2014 the perfect side hustle during his work-\nstudy hours in the library. The money was enough for him to join his new\ncollege friends on trips to Bali and Paris. \u201cSome of my friends and people I\nwas living with in my suite, they were prominent families. Their names are on\nbuildings at Yale. Their names are on buildings at Columbia. One parent is in\nthe news every day doing an interview with CNBC,\u201d says Rim.\n\nLess than a year after graduating from Yale with a degree in psychology, he\nhad enough of a client roster to move to Manhattan and work as a college\nconsultant full time. He came up with the name Command Education in the shower\nof the studio apartment he rented in the Financial District and met with\nclients at a Joe & the Juice, charging $75 an hour. Initially, the company had\na charitable bent: He was named to the Forbes \u201c30 Under 30\u201d list for\neducation, which praised his \u201cone-for-one\u201d model that meant that for every\npaying client, Command would work with a low-income student pro bono. At the\ntime, Rim told a local paper that he recognized the \u201cbig opportunity gap\u201d\nbetween the clients who could afford him and those who could not. \u201cA lot of\npeople in this industry tend to widen the gap by helping people who can afford\nit and ignoring those who can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the right way to do\nthis.\u201d\n\nThe one-for-one model didn\u2019t last. Some parents pretended they didn\u2019t have the\nmeans to pay, the pro bono students often weren\u2019t invested enough to show up,\nand working for half of his clients for free wasn\u2019t sustainable, says Rim. He\ncold-emailed everyone he could find from the Parents\u2019 Association at\nStuyvesant High School, the notoriously competitive public institution in\nlower Manhattan, and asked if he could give a presentation about college\nadmissions at no cost. \u201cI\u2019m so good at that,\u201d he says of his persistent\noutreach. (Rim occasionally does a version of this now; in the fall, he hosted\ntwo weeks of free workshops at an underserved high school in Miami.)\nEventually, a Chinese American family on the Upper East Side with a child at a\nprivate school in New Jersey heard about Rim and hired him. \u201cThey told\neveryone in their Chinese community,\u201d he says.\n\nHe broke into the city\u2019s private-school set and soon found himself in the\nfancy Fifth Avenue apartment of a new client. Rim says that one day this\nteen\u2019s mother gave him a reality check. As Rim recalls it, \u201cShe said, \u2018Chris,\nif you want to make it here in New York, you cannot charge $75. No one\u2019s going\nto take you seriously.\u2019 \u201d Rim says she told him to charge $1,500 an hour and\nvowed to bring him more clients.\n\nRim moved Command to a higher-end co-working space above Bergdorf Goodman\u2019s\nmen\u2019s store in midtown. The office \u201cskewed much older, like, sophisticated. I\nthink each office was occupied by probably some rich guy who was managing his\nown money,\u201d says Rim\u2019s friend Yaron Benchlouch, who met him while they were\nboth working there. \u201cThe juxtaposition of Chris, a young guy running around in\na T-shirt, with all these other guys in suits, big shots, that\u2019s what caught\nmy eye.\u201d He says Rim started in an office he describes as \u201ca 50-square-foot\njanitorial closet with no windows.\u201d Then, \u201che gets a bigger one, then he gets\nthe second-biggest office.\u201d\n\nWhile many of Rim\u2019s competitors were former college-admissions officers who\nknew the ins and outs of the application process, he took a page from his\nnonprofit playbook and pushed the near-peer approach to his clients, telling\nthem not only that he had recently gone to a highly selective school but also\nthat their teenagers were more likely to listen to someone in their 20s than a\nperson who looked and sounded like their parents. Clients ate it up, and\ncompared with a competitor like Ivy Coach that reportedly charges $1.5 million\nfor a multiyear package, Command was practically a bargain. Rim says one\nfamily paid him his full hourly rate to go to SoulCycle and brunch with their\n17-year-old son. Another invited him to their house in the south of France.\n\u201cThey just wanted me to be around their kid,\u201d he says.\n\nThe real boon came in 2019 when news of Operation Varsity Blues broke and the\nlarger world learned that even celebrities and multimillionaires were so\nworried about college admissions that they were willing to commit a crime to\nget their kids into the right school. In response to the scandal, The Wall\nStreet Journal published a story about college consultants with the headline\n\u201cThe Legitimate World of High-End College Admissions\u201d and included Rim. \u201cI\nthink we received 300 inquiries in 24 hours,\u201d he says.\n\nRim says he planned to move Command into a large office at 750 Lexington\nAvenue in 2020, but the pandemic hit and the company went virtual and has\nstayed that way. (The first time we spoke, the address was still listed on the\ncompany website.) He bought a $7.5 million home in Miami and bounced between\nNew York and South Beach, where some of his clients had relocated. (Rim also\nowns a $2.3 million apartment in Manhattan, according to property records.)\nCOVID turned out to be good for business. In the first 18 months of the\npandemic, as teenagers tried to learn calculus over Zoom and colleges urged\nstudents to apply early and loosened application requirements, Command tripled\nin size. Rim posted a picture of himself with his employees on a company\nretreat in Sedona, Arizona, thanking clients \u201cwho trust us with their child\u2019s\nfuture\u201d and giving a shout-out to \u201cthe parents who don\u2019t follow me on\nInstagram but religiously watch all my stories\u201d with the tongue-out emoji.\n\nIf he\u2019s at all uncomfortable with his job, he doesn\u2019t show it, and he doesn\u2019t\nsee it as working against middle-class and lower-income students who can\u2019t\nafford to hire a consultant. In his view, the game was rigged long before\nparents hired him. \u201cEven going to private school, it\u2019s an advantage. It\u2019s a\nlot of money,\u201d says Rim. \u201cSixty-thousand dollars, starting in kindergarten.\nWhat? To play with blocks?\u201d By the time these students get to high school,\ntheir private schools typically have robust college prep. At many in the city,\nguidance counselors work with 20 to 30 students; at New York City public high\nschools, the average ratio is one counselor to every 190 students.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m working with these students, people might say, \u2018Chris, you\u2019re\nhelping the rich have an unfair advantage.\u2019 Yes,\u201d he says. \u201cBut an unfair\nadvantage over other rich students. I\u2019m not helping a wealthy client take the\nspot of a low-income student or an underrepresented minority. They\u2019re\ncompeting against each other. Everyone has their own part of the college-\nadmissions process. So I\u2019m helping my client \u2018Jenny\u2019 from Horace Mann have an\nadvantage over not-my-client \u2018Johnny.\u2019 They\u2019re both billionaires.\u201d\n\nIn mid-December, when early-decision letters roll in and some students\ninevitably find out they did not get into their dream school (\u201cThe ones who\nhired our competitors,\u201d says Rim), Command\u2019s rate spikes to $250,000 for two\nweeks \u2014 just enough time to get their regular-decision applications in\nfighting shape by what, for some schools, is an early-January deadline. Rim\ninsists he\u2019s not taking advantage; that this is the cost to be one of the\nthree students his company works with during that short window. \u201cWe\u2019re going\nto work with them for maybe six to ten hours a day, including Christmas Eve,\nChristmas Day, New Year\u2019s Eve, New Year\u2019s Day,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot.\u201d It\u2019s\nalso about the cost of four years of college tuition.\n\nGuidance counselors at private schools express frustration with such\nconsultants and question families\u2019 motivations in hiring them. Frank Cabrera,\ndirector of college counseling at Brooklyn Friends School, says he understands\nwhy parents might hire a private consultant if a child has learning\ndifferences or some other extenuating circumstances, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think the\nmajority of folks fall into that bracket of people who really feel like their\nchild needs additional support in this process.\u201d\n\nAmong private-school parents, there\u2019s a paranoia that guidance counselors are\nworking for the school, not for their kid; the thinking goes that they don\u2019t\nreally care who goes to which school as much as they care about hitting\ncertain benchmarks \u2014 e.g., five kids off to Harvard, three to Stanford.\n\u201cNobody trusts their school counselor,\u201d says a Command parent. \u201cThey don\u2019t.\nBecause, for me, we pay full tuition, we donate, but we are not a trustee.\nWe\u2019re not a trustee at any of the colleges, either. And so they definitely\nhave the families they are looking out for \u2014 and that\u2019s just the way the world\nworks.\u201d\n\nWith a private consultant, \u201cyou have somebody that you feel really gives you\nunfiltered, honest feedback versus them guiding you or talking you down\nbecause they want to save space for somebody, a higher donor or a trustee.\u201d\nRim reinforces this belief with the story of his own guidance counselor\u2019s\ndiscouragement, and he urges students to push back if a school is advising\nthem against a certain college. \u201cYou have the right to apply wherever you\nwant. I give them this confidence,\u201d he says.\n\nOxelson says he and other school-based counselors he knows simply don\u2019t\noperate that way. They can also do things private consultants can\u2019t. For one,\nthey are the only people who have a full view of a student\u2019s application. They\nsee transcripts, grades, essays, teacher evaluations, and, of course, the\nletters they write. The school counselor can ensure that all the pieces of the\napplication fit together organically to tell a story. When a piece doesn\u2019t\nfit, \u201cit just looks weird,\u201d says Oxelson. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a situation where a kid\nhad a great sense of humor and the college counselor here says, \u2018You have got\nto use that sense of humor in your essays.\u2019 The independent educational\nconsultant said, \u2018No, we don\u2019t want you to do that. That\u2019s too risky.\u2019\nMeanwhile, the teachers here and the counselor have written about this kid\u2019s\nsense of humor that is showing up nowhere in that kid\u2019s portion of the\napplication. That\u2019s where it can go wrong.\u201d\n\nMichael London, who co-founded College Coach in the late \u201990s and no longer\nworks in college consulting, believes IECs can be helpful but adds that\nworking with the wrong consultant can backfire. \u201cPrivilege is not in favor\nright now. Bought experiences are experiences that came through connections;\nit\u2019s more of a turnoff, in my opinion,\u201d he says. In other words, \u201cprivilege\ndoesn\u2019t always give an advantage. The ultrapolished essay? Super-\nuninteresting. A tough read ... Someone who writes something that\u2019s a little\nbit raw is cool.\u201d\n\nThere may also be a danger in the advice that students have to be \u201cpointy.\u201d\nThere\u2019s value in trying new things in high school and building a diverse set\nof skills, and the process of trial and error helps kids learn who they are.\nThere\u2019s a narrative for those kids, too, says Trevor Day School\u2019s Exline: \u201cOne\nof the tough things about being pointy is that it can unintentionally raise\nthe bar on yourself. So if you are a pointy STEM kid and you really want to be\npremed, well, everyone who wants to be premed has an A in every science class\nand in every math class and an internship, and they\u2019ve worked in a research\nlab and they have a 1550 on the SAT and a 35 on the ACT and all these other\nthings. If you have decided to go pointy in that direction, or try to\nfabricate yourself as pointy in that direction, and you are short on any of\nthose metrics, it probably isn\u2019t going to work out. You have to be really\ncareful about where you\u2019ve decided to try to stack the deck.\u201d\n\nAs a matter of ethics, college-admissions officers won\u2019t speak with private\nconsultants \u2014 at least they purport not to \u2014 because most applicants don\u2019t\nhave one. But colleges will talk with a school-based counselor. Some are on a\nfirst-name basis. \u201cOne of the reasons I tell parents there\u2019s a risk to going\nto an IEC is that the bottom line is if a college has a question, who are they\ngoing to call? They\u2019re not going to call the IEC,\u201d says Oxelson. Not that\nparents always listen. Sometimes, Oxelson learns a student is working with\noutside help when he\u2019s reading their college essay and sees the consultant\u2019s\nname in the Google doc. (Rim says this is the same way he finds out when a\nclient is working with more than one consultant.)\n\nAccording to Rim, school-based counselors \u201chate\u201d him. The real tension seems\nto be in the secrecy. \u201cI\u2019ve never had an IEC reach out to me directly and say,\n\u2018Hey, I\u2019m working with this child, and these are my observations. I would love\nto be in partnership with you,\u2019 \u201d says Cabrera. (Cramer confirms that Command\nmentors don\u2019t speak with guidance counselors, even when clients request it.)\nCabrera notes that when a student is working with an IEC, it can cause\nconfusion if the school-based counselor and IEC are saying two different\nthings. \u201cThen it becomes a battle of Well, who do we trust? Who does the\nstudent trust? Who does the parent trust?\u201d And private consultants make more\nmoney. In some cases, a lot more. \u201cPart of the tension I feel is also, How are\nyou benefiting financially from my expertise for free? \u201d says Cabrera.\n\n\u201cI had a kid tell me once, \u2018My parents hired an independent college counselor\nbecause they said if the Horace Mann counselors were any good, they would go\nbe an IEC,\u2019 because that\u2019s where you make the money,\u201d says Oxelson.\n\nColleges are just as unwilling to talk about independent consultants as\nCommand\u2019s clients are. When asked if they actively discourage students from\npaying a third party to help with the application process, Cornell, Harvard,\nand UPenn declined to comment. Caltech wrote, \u201cWe would prefer not to\nrespond,\u201d and Columbia said it would circle back and never did. MIT,\nPrinceton, Duke, Northwestern, the University of Chicago, and Stanford ignored\nthe request altogether. Dartmouth answered that its admissions officers \u201cdo\nnot engage with third-party consultants, only in-school counselors and those\nassociated with community-based organizations.\u201d Brown said that its\napplication asks students to confirm that the information they submitted \u201cis\naccurate and wholly their own\u201d and that while its admissions officers will\ntalk to school-based counselors, those officers don\u2019t interact directly with\nindependent counselors or consultants. Not a single school agreed to be\ninterviewed; a few cited the busy admissions season.\n\nMark Dunn, senior associate director of undergraduate admissions at Yale, also\nsaid \u201cno\u201d to an interview but wrote in an email, \u201cIn my opinion, working with\nan IEC can ultimately work against an applicant.\u201d He continued in part, \u201cAn\napplication can also seem overly engineered in a way that makes us question\nwhat motivated a student to pursue the commitments they\u2019ve included with their\nactivities list, or simply why they are presenting themselves in a way that\nseems like what they think an admissions committee wants.\u201d\n\nEven college consultants admit they\u2019re not always successful. Rim pulls out\nhis phone to look at old messages from a parent \u2014 \u201ca huge CEO\u201d \u2014 who was upset\nthat his child didn\u2019t initially get into any of his top schools. \u201cThe parent\nwent off on me, cursed me out, blah, blah, blah. Sent me the rudest messages,\u201d\nsays Rim, scrolling and shaking his head. \u201cThey will create this narrative\nthat they think they deserve it because they worked hard. I\u2019m like, \u2018You\ndeserve it, but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to get it. That\u2019s what this\nis.\u2019 \u201d Normally, he says, he would feel bad, but in this case, the parent\n\u201cedited all of our work.\u201d Reading from his phone, Rim says this is what he\nwrote in response: \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, but you didn\u2019t listen to us. So there\u2019s\nnothing I can really do.\u201d When the parent messaged back in the same tone, Rim\nsays he went \u201cfull force.\u201d \u201cI was like, \u2018You didn\u2019t listen to us. You hired\nus, and you feel dumb,\u2019 \u201d he says.\n\nWhen Rim was starting out, he didn\u2019t correct his clients when he disagreed\nwith them. It was too intimidating. But he\u2019s over that, he says. Once, when a\nstudent said he could get a letter of recommendation from President Biden\nbecause his dad was a donor, Rim said \u201cno.\u201d \u201cI told him, \u2018It\u2019s going to be a\ngeneric letter,\u2019\u201d he explains. He has also had to remind parents, when they\u2019re\nannoyed that a mentor didn\u2019t text their child about basketball practice, that\nCommand is not a nanny service. Sometimes the kids themselves overstep. \u201cIt\u2019s\nweird when a student is like, \u2018I assigned you to do this research for me,\u2019 to\nmy mentor. We\u2019re like, \u2018Wait a minute, we\u2019re not your assistant, and also you\nneed to do this yourself.\u2019\u201d It raises a question: If you have to pay for\nsomeone to remind your kid about basketball practice, is he really a Harvard\nman?\n\nAs we walk out of the Aman Club and onto the sidewalk, I ask Rim if he\u2019s\nstaying there tonight before flying back to Miami. (He is currently renting\nout his Manhattan apartment.) He laughs and shakes his head. \u201cNo way \u2014 it\u2019s\ntoo expensive,\u201d he says. He seems to have deactivated from sales mode and\nappears more like a 20-something going to meet up with a friend, which he is.\nAfter we say good-bye, I glance at my phone and realize our meeting lasted two\nand a half hours. The numbers swirl in my mind. If I were a client, I\u2019d owe\nhim more than $30,000.\n\nThank you for subscribing and supporting our journalism.
