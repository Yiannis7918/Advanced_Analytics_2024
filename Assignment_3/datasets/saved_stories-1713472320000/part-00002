Manual updates led to errors. Everyone questioned the\n> accuracy of the numbers. Many people just stopped looking at the\n> reports.After Definite, everything ran like clockwork.All our data was\n> automatically updated and our dashboards were sent at the same time every\n> day. We could also slice the data in the app however we needed.We\n> immediately saved thousands of dollars per month in the time spent updating\n> reports and have built strategies (e.g. improved ROI on ad spend, inventory\n> management, etc.) on the data that will yield millions to our bottom line.\u201d\n\nRyan\n\nCEO of a 9-figure E-commerce Company\n\n##\n\nData doesn\u2019t need to be so hard.\n\nGet started for free\n\n", "frontpage": false}
