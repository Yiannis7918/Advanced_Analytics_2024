Code-named Hala Point, this large-scale neuromorphic\nsystem, initially deployed at Sandia National Laboratories, utilizes Intel\u2019s\nLoihi 2 processor, aims at supporting research for future brain-inspired\nartificial intelligence (AI), and tackles challenges related to the efficiency\nand sustainability of today\u2019s AI. Hala Point advances Intel\u2019s first-generation\nlarge-scale research system, Pohoiki Springs, with architectural improvements\nto achieve over 10 times more neuron capacity and up to 12 times higher\nperformance.\n\n> \u201cThe computing cost of today\u2019s AI models is rising at unsustainable rates.\n> The industry needs fundamentally new approaches capable of scaling. For that\n> reason, we developed Hala Point, which combines deep learning efficiency\n> with novel brain-inspired learning and optimization capabilities. We hope\n> that research with Hala Point will advance the efficiency and adaptability\n> of large-scale AI technology.\u201d\n>\n> \u2013Mike Davies, director of the Neuromorphic Computing Lab at Intel Labs\n\nWhat It Does: Hala Point is the first large-scale neuromorphic system to\ndemonstrate state-of-the-art computational efficiencies on mainstream AI\nworkloads. Characterization shows it can support up to 20 quadrillion\noperations per second, or 20 petaops, with an efficiency exceeding 15 trillion\n8-bit operations per second per watt (TOPS/W) when executing conventional deep\nneural networks. This rivals and exceeds levels achieved by architectures\nbuilt on graphics processing units (GPU) and central processing units (CPU).\nHala Point\u2019s unique capabilities could enable future real-time continuous\nlearning for AI applications such as scientific and engineering problem-\nsolving, logistics, smart city infrastructure management, large language\nmodels (LLMs) and AI agents.\n\nHow It will be Used: Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories plan to use\nHala Point for advanced brain-scale computing research. The organization will\nfocus on solving scientific computing problems in device physics, computer\narchitecture, computer science and informatics.\n\n\u201cWorking with Hala Point improves our Sandia team\u2019s capability to solve\ncomputational and scientific modeling problems. Conducting research with a\nsystem of this size will allow us to keep pace with AI\u2019s evolution in fields\nranging from commercial to defense to basic science,\u201d said Craig Vineyard,\nHala Point team lead at Sandia National Laboratories.\n\nCurrently, Hala Point is a research prototype that will advance the\ncapabilities of future commercial systems. Intel anticipates that such lessons\nwill lead to practical advancements, such as the ability for LLMs to learn\ncontinuously from new data. Such advancements promise to significantly reduce\nthe unsustainable training burden of widespread AI deployments.\n\nWhy It Matters: Recent trends in scaling up deep learning models to trillions\nof parameters have exposed daunting sustainability challenges in AI and have\nhighlighted the need for innovation at the lowest levels of hardware\narchitecture. Neuromorphic computing is a fundamentally new approach that\ndraws on neuroscience insights that integrate memory and computing with highly\ngranular parallelism to minimize data movement. In published results from this\nmonth\u2019s International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing\n(ICASSP), Loihi 2 demonstrated orders of magnitude gains in the efficiency,\nspeed and adaptability of emerging small-scale edge workloads^1.\n\nAdvancing on its predecessor, Pohoiki Springs, with numerous improvements,\nHala Point now brings neuromorphic performance and efficiency gains to\nmainstream conventional deep learning models, notably those processing real-\ntime workloads such as video, speech and wireless communications. For example,\nEricsson Research is applying Loihi 2 to optimize telecom infrastructure\nefficiency, as highlighted at this year\u2019s Mobile World Congress.\n\nHala Point, the world\u2019s largest and Intel\u2019s most advanced neuromorphic system\nto date, contains 1.15 billion neurons and packages 1,152 Loihi 2 processors\nproduced on Intel 4 process node in a six-rack-unit data center chassis the\nsize of a microwave oven. The system supports up to 1.15 billion neurons and\n128 billion synapses distributed over 140,544 neuromorphic processing cores,\nconsuming a maximum of 2,600 watts of power. It also includes over 2,300\nembedded x86 processors for ancillary computations.

Neurons communicate\ndirectly with one another rather than communicating through memory, reducing\noverall power consumption.\n\nHala Point packages 1,152 Loihi 2 processors produced on Intel 4 process node\nin a six-rack-unit data center chassis the size of a microwave oven. The\nsystem supports up to 1.15 billion neurons and 128 billion synapses\ndistributed over 140,544 neuromorphic processing cores, consuming a maximum of\n2,600 watts of power. It also includes over 2,300 embedded x86 processors for\nancillary computations.\n\nHala Point integrates processing, memory, and communication channels in a\nmassively parallelized fabric, providing a total of 16 petabytes per second\n(PB/s) of memory bandwidth, 3.5 PB/s of inter-core communication bandwidth,\nand 5 terabytes per second (TB/s) of inter-chip communication bandwidth. The\nsystem can process over 380 trillion 8-bit synapses and over 240 trillion\nneuron operations per second.\n\nApplied to bio-inspired spiking neural network models, the system can execute\nits full capacity of 1.15 billion neurons 20 times faster than a human brain\nand up to 200 times faster rates at lower capacity. While Hala Point is not\nintended for neuroscience modeling, its neuron capacity is roughly equivalent\nto that of an owl brain or the cortex of a capuchin monkey.\n\nLoihi-based systems can perform AI inference and solve optimization problems\nusing 100 times less energy at speeds as much as 50 times faster than\nconventional CPU and GPU architectures^1. By exploiting up to 10:1 sparse\nconnectivity and event-driven activity, early results on Hala Point show the\nsystem can achieve deep neural network efficiencies as high as 15 TOPS/W^2\nwithout requiring input data to be collected into batches, a common\noptimization for GPUs that significantly delays the processing of data\narriving in real-time, such as video from cameras. While still in research,\nfuture neuromorphic LLMs capable of continuous learning could result in\ngigawatt-hours of energy savings by eliminating the need for periodic re-\ntraining with ever-growing datasets.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next: The delivery of Hala Point to Sandia National Labs marks the\nfirst deployment of a new family of large-scale neuromorphic research systems\nthat Intel plans to share with its research collaborators. Further development\nwill enable neuromorphic computing applications to overcome power and latency\nconstraints that limit AI capabilities' real-world, real-time deployment.\n\nTogether with an ecosystem of more than 200 Intel Neuromorphic Research\nCommunity (INRC) members, including leading academic groups, government labs,\nresearch institutions and companies worldwide, Intel is working to push the\nboundaries of brain-inspired AI and progressing this technology from research\nprototypes to industry-leading commercial products over the coming years.\n\nMore context: Intel Labs\n\n_The Small Print:\n\n_^1 See \u201cEfficient Video and Audio Processing with Loihi 2,\u201d International\nConference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, April 2024, and\n\u201cAdvancing Neuromorphic Computing with Loihi: Survey of Results and Outlook,\u201d\nProceedings of the IEEE, 2021.\n\n_^2 Characterization performed with a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network\nwith 14,784 layers, 2048 neurons per layer, 8-bit weights stimulated with\nrandom noise.
