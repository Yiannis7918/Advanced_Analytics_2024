In that time I\u2019ve met a ton of interesting people, joined a community,\ncontributed back to that community, launched a company and built a scuttlebutt\napp, planetary.social.\n\nBefore i get in to strategy and plans, I wanted to share again the mission,\nvision, and values around which we\u2019ve built planetary.\n\n\ud83e\udded Mission\n\nTo make a contribution to the world by making tools for the mind that advance\nhumankind.\n\nPlanetary is a place where communities can exist and grow through self\norganization and self ownership, in an environment that promotes creativity,\nplayfulness, and a healthy commons.\n\n\ud83d\udd2d Vision\n\nWe do this through building tech tools for a radically better world of social\nliberation and connection. Tech that treats humans as people not commodities\nand optimizes for health not engagement. We defend choice in who and what\ncontent you are connected to, with open source programming that allows you to\ncontribute to the app design and your own algorithms, and transparency. A\ndigital space governed by a commons, liberated from state and private\nownership, because the digital space belongs to all of us.\n\n\u2696\ufe0f Values\n\n\u2022 Sustainability\n\n\u2022 Plurality\n\n\u2022 Culture of accountability\n\n\u2022 Autonomy\n\n\u2022 Humanity\n\n\u2022 Self Organization\n\n\u2022 Self Ownership\n\n\u2022 Decentralization\n\n\u2022 Localism\n\n\u2022 Agency and Trust\n\nThe mission of our company isn\u2019t to build the best scuttlebutt app. We\u2019ve got\nbroader goals, and we need to periodically look the work we\u2019re doing to make\nsure we\u2019re doing our best to advance the mission, vision, and values.\n\nIn our research on what social media needed as part of Planetary, a bunch of\nthings around ssb really work: its mutual aid model of content hosting is\ngreat, the follow graph is really effective at diffusing flamewars and abuse.\nThe offline-first nature of SSB is also really nifty, but I increasingly\nwonder if that is holding SSB back.\n\nIn particular the core implementations scuttlebutt were clunky and it was hard\nto run them on phones. The way phones are walled off from the rest of the\ninternet is also a big problem. So we first took the go-ssb code which wasn\u2019t\nfully working, and continued developing it. Then more recently decided it\nneeded a radical restructuring so we made scuttlego. The new planetary builds\nwith scuttlego work really well, it feels snappy the way patchwork does.\n\nAnother core thing i wanted to tackle is how to find your people. How to\ndiscover individuals and communities that you want to talk to. At the moment,\nscuttlebutt is both a social space and technology. The social space is tightly\ninterconnected and if you\u2019ve got values which align with the solarpunk vibe,\nthen it works great. But if you\u2019re wanting to talk about different things,\nwith different kinds of people, then it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s for you.\n\nTo fix that i did many experiments including topical pubs, automatically\nconnecting planetary users to a service pub, and most recently a web viewer\npaired with rooms. You can see it live at https://planetary.name. These\ncommunity servers help people connect, discover their people, have visibility\non to the larger web, and create a potential boundary around which a commons\ngovernance model can be built. It\u2019s a bit of a hack, overloading features on\ntop of scuttlebutt which is supposed to be a flat network, but needs this\nextra layer. Other protocols like at_protocol, chatternet, nostr, and\nfarcaster do a better job of explicitly using multiple servers to be delegated\nhosts of content and be a place for shared moderation to happen.\n\nEven with our work of room+pub+viewer that we\u2019ve launched, there is a lot of\nstuff in scuttlebutt which makes it hard for me to recommend it to friends.\nIt\u2019s slow, the model is confusing, but most importantly, there is no delete\nand it is basically impossible to use the same identity on multiple devices.\nThere are more technical stumbling blocks that we haven\u2019t found a way to\naddress. There are a bunch of other things which are preventing scuttlebutt\nfrom realizing its potential. It was designed first and foremost as a tool to\nrun on computers not phones. When we try and move to the mobile environment,\nwe get the advantages of always being with people, integrated camera, and the\nability to do local mesh syncing via hotspot pubs or directly. This is all\nheld back by fundamental design features in scuttlebutt like needing a whole\nlog, not being able to see information about a user without finding and\nparsing all their about messages, and the coming but not yet ready private\ngroups are major stumbling blocks.\n\nFor developers implementing an app on ssb is hard because of several things.\nFirst the custom RPC layer is ssb only, the libraries tend to use custom\ndatabases and a model of pull streams that aren\u2019t well known, and there\u2019s a\nlot to figure out.\n\nSecure Scuttlebutt has a lot holding it back and we should learn from it\nwithout feeling obligated to provide backwards compatibility. This is the same\nconclusion that Andre has made as he looks to go to ssb2. It\u2019s also the\ndecision that lead to the development of earthstar, p2panda, moderator,\nchatternet, nostr, farcaster, and the at_protocol. So many people have looked\nat ssb and decided there\u2019s something very interesting there, but also\nlimitations.\n\nThe work on metafeeds, new feed formats, fusion identities, edits, delete, and\nprivate groups is all important but the progress is very slow because of the\nlegacy use and implementations that we carry. The signing of the entire log\nmakes everything harder and for what I want to build doesn't provide much\nvalue. The offline first stuff is cool, but rarely used and also makes\neverything harder.\n\nPivoting away from scuttlebutt The big 2023 news for me is that we\u2019re taking\ncode and ideas from planetary and pivoting off of SSB. The planetary app isn\u2019t\ngoing away, in fact we\u2019re about to push a major update using scuttlego which\nis improves the performance and experience. But we\u2019re focusing new work on a\nnew app, derived from planetary called nos.social. At the start of the year\n@Matt Lorentz wrote up a comparison between Scuttlebutt and Nostr.\n\nThe primary benefits that we saw in #nostr were these:\n\n\u2022 There is no strong enforcement of message order with the signed log, clients\njust sign individual messages which are casually sorted via timestamp. This\nmeans some messages might not be kept around, but it makes syncing a bit\nharder and creating and consuming feeds much easier. Using relay servers and\ncasual ordering means that Nostr users see updates faster than is possible\nwith ssb.\n\n\u2022 The cloud hosting of your content is intentional vs the way scuttlebutt has\nan uneasy relationship with pubs. With Nostr users choose where their data is\nhosted and that gives them more agency and control.\n\n\u2022 Delete, edit, and ephemeral messages are easy because we\u2019re not trying to\nvalidate the entire log. All of our user research showed that users want the\nautonomy of control over their data, and central to that is delete and edit.\nEven when they know their delete requests might not be honored everywhere.\n\n\u2022 It\u2019s easier to build on nostr, there\u2019s more development happening, and a\nwillingness to write specs. We\u2019ve seen wave after wave of enthusiastic ssb\ndev\u2019s give up because our protocol is too hard to work with.\n\nI\u2019ve always thought, and occasionally said, that if something better came\nalong, we\u2019d switch planetary over to it. I thought that p2panda and earthstar\nwould be it, but although super interesting, both evolved in ways that weren\u2019t\na great fit for the kind of social app that planetary, manyverse, and\npatchwork provide users.\n\nI then thought that @paul and @arcalinea would come up with a good successor\nprotocol out of the bluesky project. The at_protocol is interesting, but the\nentire bluesky project is moving slow and I think the press and abundance of\nattention focused on it has made their job much harder.\n\nWhich brings us to Nostr... We made an evaluation to see if we can make an app\nand protocol which fits our mission, vision, and values.\n\nNostr\n\nAnybody who joins Nostr will quickly see that its early adopter community has\na very different set of values and social norms from Scuttlebutt\u2019s. It\u2019s full\nof bitcoin bros (or as they like to call themselves, \u201cmaximalists\u201d). But the\nthing is, I was never building tools just for solarpunk anarchists. I was\nbuilding tools where a multitude of communities could each establish their own\nself-governing commons. By definition those tools will include many\ncommunities which are not mine, or where I wouldn\u2019t feel welcome.\n\nNostr, with it\u2019s open relays, is functionally very similar to scuttlebutt with\nits open pubs and rooms. Neither have the web of social trust that makes the\nintimate scuttleverse work. But in work to make scuttlebutt more open,\naccessible, and pluralistic, I\u2019ve setup a ton of public rooms and pubs. These\nhave helped people join the network and find community.\n\nWhile nostr is not a purely pull model like ssb, there can be protections of\nusers, for example the nostr model does let you push content to a user, but\nonly if they read from a relay the pusher is publishing to. And many nostr\nclients display a global view, of all content they can find. This has lead to\na bunch of spam on nostr, but i think if scuttlebutt had gotten attention we\u2019d\nbe seeing more spam on any open pub or room.\n\nIf we can make a way for users of nos.social to create their own communities,\ngoverned as a commons, that meets our vision, mission, and values, then that\u2019s\nthe actual point. And i think we can do that by introducing a bunch more\nsolutions that come from many projects including ssb. Relays are nodes which\ncan provide a more federated governance model than what we see in SSB, but\nalso provides for user autonomy to have multiple personas than is possible in\nthe fediverse. I think there\u2019s a reason why many of the post ssb signed log\ngossipy social media protocols have gone from purely peer to peer to a hub and\nspoke model of content hosting. We\u2019ve got easy cheap cloud computing, we\nshould use it instead of making our phones work overtime.\n\nScuttlebutt Community\n\nWhat does this mean for planetary and the scuttlebutt community? We\u2019re\nfocusing on another protocol. We\u2019ll keep planetary as a scuttlebutt app,\nsupporting the existing rooms and pubs. We\u2019re releasing a big update with\n#scuttlego this week. It wraps up the projects we started 6 months ago to make\nplanetary as a scuttlebutt app work better. For example, I can now send people\nto rabble.nz and from that they can see something about me and #scuttlego me\non any ssb app.\n\nWith this shift, we\u2019re going to wind down funding of scuttlebutt. The funding\nof many ssb projects and several scuttlebutt gatherings is something we did to\nbuild out the larger ecosystem. And a lot of good came out of that. But I\u2019m\nrunning a mission driven public benefit corporation with limited resources.\n\nSome of the scuttlebutt projects we funded:\n\n\u2022 Scuttlecamp 2018 - travel, staffing, venue, etc..\n\n\u2022 dweb camp 2019 - paid for travel for butts to attend\n\n\u2022 dweb camp 2022 - paid for travel for butts to attend\n\n\u2022 p2basel 2023 - paid for travel for butts to attend\n\n\u2022 @Christian Bundy - Provided salary for undirected development on open source\necosystem\n\n\u2022 @cryptix - Provided salary for development of go-ssb in to a second full ssb\nimplementation to compliment js ssb.\n\n\u2022 @boreq - Funded the development on both go-ssb and also the creation of a\nnew ssb sdk in scuttlego.\n\n\u2022 @mixmix & @chereseeriepa - Funded building a ssb pub using ssb-db2 with a\ngraphql interface and a updated version of the web viewer with formalization\nof PublicWebHosting spec.\n\n\u2022 Funding through Open Collective of many ssb projects including patchfox,\nmanyverse, ssb maintenance, peach cloud, and others.\n\nThe ending of active development of both Manyverse and Planetary, marks an end\nof an era. Both apps, like patchwork, continue to work. They\u2019re open source,\nso anybody can step up a fork or make PR\u2019s and contribute. When it comes to\nplanetary, if we do get contributions, we\u2019re happy to push out updated\nreleases. We\u2019re not shutting the app down or locking the repo like happened\nwith patchwork. We\u2019ll continue to run the associated cloud services as long as\nwe\u2019re able and they don\u2019t become security or safety issues.\n\nThe communities using ssb can continue for a long time. Either waiting for new\ndevs who want to take up the mantle or on the apps as they are. Scuttlebutt\nhas always been an experiment, and is about more than a specific protocol or\nset of libraries. I\u2019m sure that the communal effort to create a social media\ncommons will continue. The future is one we\u2019ll build together. We see\nincreasing connections and collaboration between projects, like the way\np2basel was not just a purely scuttlebutt event.\n\nI look forward to talking to, collaborating with, and learning from all of you\nfor years to come. I want to thank everybody who's been a part of making\nscuttlebutt what it is. In particular @andrestaltz for making manyverse,\n@mixmix for both the software contributions and also being the connector that\nbrought the community together rooted in both running code and shared values.\nLastly @Dominic creating scuttlebutt and secure scuttlebutt in the first\nplace.\n\n## Subscribe to our newsletter\n\nVitae congue eu consequat ac felis lacerat vestibu lectus mauris ultrices.\n\nThanks for joining our newsletter.\n\nOops!
