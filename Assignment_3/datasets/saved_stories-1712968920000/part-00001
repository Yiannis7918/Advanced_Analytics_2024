SIGBOVIK (Special Interest Group on Harry\nQuadragesimal Bovik) is an annual multidisciplinary conference specializing in\nlesser-known areas of academic research such as Integer-Based Vulnerabilities,\nRegret-Minimizing Algorithms, and k-Armed Bandits.\n\nSIGBOVIK 2024 is the eighteenth edition of this esteemed conference series,\nwhich was formed in 2007 to celebrate the inestimable and variegated work of\nHarry Quirk Bovik. We especially welcome the three neglected quadrants of\nresearch: joke realizations of joke ideas, joke realizations of serious ideas,\nand serious realizations of joke ideas. (In other words: SIGBOVIK is an\nevening of tongue-in-cheek academic presentations, a venue for silly ideas\nand/or executions.)\n\nSIGBOVIK 2024 is happening in person at Rashid Auditorium, Gates-Hillman\nCenter, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Ave., Pittsburgh,\nPennsylvania, USA 15213 on April 5th.\n\n### Proceedings\n\nAvailable as a PDF or as bound volume.\n\nThe proceedings are not yet available as the conference has not yet proceeded.\nThey will maybe be available for purchase at the conference, or at least an\nIOU (\"I Owe You\"), i.e., we owe you one proceedings booklet. We might do a\nbulk order of physical proceedings for local purchase if it becomes safe to do\nso in the near future. Or we might not. That does sound like work\u2014and SIGBOVIK\nis all about play. \"If you love your work, you'll never work a day in your\nlife.\" \u2014Not Harry Q. Bovik\n\n### Venue\n\nSIGBOVIK will be held in Rashid Auditorium on April 5 at 6pm EDT.\n\n### Submission Instructions\n\nSIGBOVIK accepts papers, presentations, and reviews.
