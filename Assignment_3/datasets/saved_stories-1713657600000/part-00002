The pure drilling side (not\nincluding running casing and other non-drilling tasks) has a learning rate\nthat could be as rapid as technologies like solar, wind, and batteries. It\nseems to keep progressing while fracturing productivity improves more slowly.\nDrilling speed increases see diminishing returns in shale wells as non-\ndrilling activities dominate total construction time. Total rig productivity\nhas increased ~50x-100x from drilling and completions since the earliest days\nin plays like the Marcellus Shale.\n\nFew studies evaluate drilling speed learning curves, but they suggest that\ntotal drilling speed increases by 5%-15% for every doubling of experience.\nThese numbers include running casing, cementing, and nippling up blow-out\npreventers, which are activities that improve slower than on bottom drilling.\nThe drilling portion could have up to a 20% learning rate, though the\nuncertainty is high.\n\nThere are several reasons to think the learning rate is aggressive:\n\n  1. Feedback is constant, inexpensive, high signal, and instantaneous. You are making hole, or you aren\u2019t.\n\n  2. The supply chain is geared to rapidly iterate on bit, motor, and directional tool design.\n\nThe manufacture of these items is surprisingly labor intensive, but that\nallows rapid iteration. Bit designs can have lot sizes as small as fifty\nunits. Lot size can be even smaller for motors and directional tools.\n\n  3. Drilling is far away from physical limits.\n\nBits, motors, and tools for drilling granite might improve speed and longevity\nseveral times in the most demanding applications.\n\n### Moving Geothermal Down the Drilling Learning Curve\n\nThe geothermal startup Eavor is notable for its underground, closed-loop\nradiator design instead of trying to pump water through fractures between\nwells. The architecture eliminates steel casing because the granite rock that\nadvanced geothermal companies target is solid and easy to seal off. The cost\nis almost 100% pure drilling. The learning rate for drilling determines future\ncosts.\n\nThe company has recently released more details on its first commercial project\nin Germany. It will drill almost 1.2 million feet of hole to produce 8 MW of\nelectricity from 64 MW of steam. That is a pretty absurd amount of footage,\nand the 2.5-year project will push footage drilled in granite rock through 3-4\ndoublings. They could go through as many as 10-20 bit design iterations. The\ncost per foot of drilling might fall 60% from this single project if the\nlearning rate is anywhere near solar or wind.\n\nIt may not be apparent why granite drilling should have a different, reset\nlearning rate than drilling in sedimentary rock. Bottom-hole assemblies can\nimprove from general improvements and local optimizations. The improvement in\ncutter quality has been substantial and improves performance globally.\nHowever, specific optimizations drive a significant portion of performance\nimprovements. Cutter design, cutter layout, and rig parameters (weight on bit,\npumping rate, etc.) coevolve for specific basins and rock types. One bit's\ncutters aren't compatible with another that has evolved differently.\n\nGlobal improvements for bottom hole assemblies have advanced enough to make\nthem competitive for drilling granite, but local optimization has barely\nstarted. And these local improvements are critical because granite is abrasive\nand hard. The abrasion requires hard cutters to resist erosion, but these are\noften brittle and vulnerable to impact damage from hitting the rock face. One\nevolutionary path could be altering operating parameters and the bottom hole\nassembly to minimize bit impacts on the rock while maximizing cutter hardness.\n\nProductivity should see a quick burst from optimization that levels off as it\napproaches global limits. Closed-loop geothermal could start pushing global\nproductivity because repowering China's existing district heating systems\nwould require roughly the same amount of drilling footage as all horizontal\nwells drilled.\n\n## Judging Market Impact\n\n### The Learning Impact on Economics\n\nClosed-loop geothermal projects require drilling ~200x more footage to produce\nthe same energy as the best shale gas wells. That may seem ridiculous, but a\ncasing-less closed-loop design cuts out the majority of cost categories a\nshale well has. Mud, casing, cement, fracturing, water, facilities, and\nproduction equipment are zero or dramatically reduced. The architecture rides\nthe wave of drilling productivity and benefits from increased drilling speed\nmuch longer than shale wells.\n\nAdditionally, the geothermal system can be in a customer's parking lot.\nCapital expenditure for a shale gas well in Pennsylvania can be <$0.40/MCF.\nThe gas market price is ~$3/MCF by the time it reaches Louisiana and $10/MCF\ndelivered to Europe. A parking lot geothermal well is selling heat at its\nwellhead price.\n\nIf Eavor's timelines hold and their spending is reasonable, then the Germany\nproject can already provide heat for less than European gas. A high-\nutilization project might deliver heat for $20/MWh vs. European gas at $40/MWh\nthermal. Doubling the footage drilled in a day might reduce costs by ~40% and\nmake closed-loop geothermal competitive with gas almost anywhere. Only fifty\nEavor Germany projects would reach global gas parity at the most conservative\n5% learning rate. That is a drop in the bucket since it might take ten\nthousand projects to service existing district heating systems. There is also\nthe potential for process heat at factories like paper mills that offer an\nopportunity many times the size of district heating.\n\n### Minimizing Total Cost and Effort\n\nItems like financing and operating costs can factor heavily into\ncompetitiveness, especially as capital expenditures fall. An underground\nradiator has little technical risk compared to anything involving fracturing,\nwhich should make financing cheaper. The fluid can thermosiphon to reduce\npumping costs, and water loss is negligible. Enhanced geothermal projects need\na fair amount of pressure to push fluid through fractures and often have a\nsignificant fluid loss rate. Closed-loop designs could gain a $5-$10 per\nmegawatt hour (thermal) edge through better interest rates and lower operating\ncosts. Even a small amount of learning will push closed-loop drilling costs\nbelow enhanced geothermal systems - if they aren't there already.\n\nThe ease of scalability also makes a difference. Closed-loop already dominates\nmind share in markets like Europe, South Korea, and Japan because it\neliminates induced seismicity risk and doesn't utilize banned fracking\ntechnology. Closed-loop geothermal also has a massive advantage in service\nintensity. Hydraulic fracturing requires a much larger ecosystem of suppliers,\nmany of which have heavy footprints or operate at high utilization to provide\nreasonable cost. Pressure pumping would be the primary concern because it\nwould likely take 5-15 rigs to support one frac spread and 15-45 rigs to have\na healthy pressure pumping market. Closed-loop geothermal is viable with one\nrig with even a tiny existing drilling service sector. Many items like\ndirectional tools, motors, or bits are easy to ship. The activation energy for\nclosed-loop systems is low.\n\n### Keeping Up With the Pack\n\nThere is an underlying wave of deflation rippling through global energy\nmarkets. Shale gas, solar, wind, and batteries have all seen rapid cost\ndeclines as they gain scale. These sources are still a fraction of energy\nproduction, but their rapid growth will start impacting marginal pricing\nshortly (where it hasn't already!). The faster a contending energy technology\ncan scale, the more relevant it will be.\n\nHeat-only closed-loop geothermal using conventional drilling technology has\nthe fastest scaling potential of any geothermal variant. It takes much longer\nto iterate on fracture design, build/interconnect power plants, or develop new\ndrilling technology. There is no shortage of market opportunity with heat.\nSomething like half of Europe's energy use is heat, and most is theoretically\naddressable by geothermal. China's district heating systems use as much energy\nas the United Kingdom.\n\nThe smaller service footprint also eases the scaling of labor and equipment.\nProducing 3000 drilling rigs instead of 1000 rigs is simpler than ramping\nproduction of every drilling and completion service item. Geothermal companies\nwith heat purchase agreements can sign long-term rig contracts that allow\nmanufacturers to borrow money for working capital and faster scaling. Fast\ngrowth isn't guaranteed, but the supply chain shouldn't be the limiter.\n\nSolar plus thermal storage and fracked natural gas are the main competitors in\nthe heat sector. The cost of all three technologies can get so low that the\nsmall contextual details determine the winner. Transportation costs or carbon\ntaxes can hurt gas even if the wellhead price is near zero. Solar will perform\nbest in lower latitudes where the user needs hot gas instead of steam. There\nmust also be enough land for panels. Industrial heat pumps could find a niche\nwith small users that lack space. Geothermal is best suited for larger loads\nat high latitudes that need low-temperature steam and have land constraints.\nUrban district heating systems are the best market, especially since their\npeak load is in the winter when solar generates less electricity.\n\n## Drilling to the Future\n\nClosed-loop geothermal isn't the sexiest geothermal technology, but it has the\nmost potential for learning. The instant feedback, light service footprint,\nand flexible supply chain drive the learning rate. Progress can happen fast\nenough to stay competitive with other technologies.\n\n\u00a9 2024\n\n", "frontpage": false}
