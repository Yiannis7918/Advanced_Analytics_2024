She had a passion for foreign languages and dreamed of becoming a\nteacher. She had never heard of synthetic opioids before.\n\nAfter graduating, Sammy found work at a chemicals company in the Chinese city\nof Shijiazhuang, selling what she thought were chemicals to clients around the\nworld. She would practice English every day speaking to her customers online,\nand earn a commission for each sale she made. Her dreams of becoming a teacher\nquickly faded.\n\n\"Maybe others are just like me... At the start we don't know what we are\nselling, but when we find out we have fallen in love with the work,\" she said.\n\"This work can make money,\" she adds.\n\nSammy [not her real name] is an unlikely drug trafficker. She is one of what\ninternational law enforcement agencies estimate could be thousands of online\nsales representatives, working for illicit Chinese pharmaceutical and chemical\ncompanies producing and smuggling illegal laboratory made drugs.\n\nThe US government has long accused China of flooding the country with deadly\ndrugs like fentanyl, a synthetic opioid up to 50 times stronger than heroin,\nclaims the Chinese government denies. The US says Chinese-made opioids are\nfuelling the worst drug crisis in the country's history. In 2022 more than\n70,000 Americans died from fentanyl overdoses.\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe US has a problem with the smuggling and abuse of the powerful opioid\nfentanyl\n\nAccording to a report published by the US select committee on the Chinese\nCommunist Party, the Chinese government provides subsidies to companies openly\ntrafficking illicit synthetic drugs. The report found tens of thousands of\nposts online advertising illegal drugs and pre-cursors.\n\nThe study claims that \"wholly state owned\" companies are involved in the\ntrafficking of drugs. The Chinese government has consistently denied knowledge\nof the illegal drug trade.\n\nMany like Sammy fall into the drug trade seemingly by accident, initially\nunaware of the products they are peddling online and their deadly\nconsequences. But others are more aware of what they are selling.\n\nEach morning Sara [not her real name] posts photos and videos across her\nsocial media platforms advertising drugs; synthetic cannabinoids, precursors\nfor MDMA, and nitazenes, a synthetic opioid considered up to 50 times more\npotent than even fentanyl.\n\n\"We have many customers in Britain and have cooperated with them many times,\"\nboasts Sara, an international trade graduate, now working for an online\nplatform.\n\nWhen challenged, she is not drawn into a moral discussion about selling drugs.\nShe claims she never asks customers how they use what she sells.\n\nThe UK National Crime and Agency (NCA) believes drug dealers are mixing the\nsynthetic opioid with street drugs such as heroin.\n\nAccording to the NCA, there have been more than 100 deaths linked to nitazenes\nover the past nine months, leading health professionals to warn the UK may be\nfacing a drug-related crisis.\n\nThe BBC has found hundreds of adverts for nitazenes online. Suppliers\ncontacted claim to send shipments through courier services, mislabelling\ndeliveries and hiding drugs in fake packaging. The BBC has also seen courier\ntracking numbers provided by online sales representative in China claiming to\nhave made successful deliveries across the UK.\n\nSara entered the business after university. She thought she was selling\nchemicals. She has worked in the industry for two and a half years. \"I know\nmost of the products,\" she says.\n\n\"My boss has been running this company for more than seven years, and he knows\nlots of customers and freight forwarders. If the product is detained, he will\nlose the most. So he will try his best to make the product reach you\nsmoothly,\" she adds.\n\nIn March, the UK government classified 15 synthetic opioids as Class A drugs.\nUnder the Misuse of Drugs act anyone caught supplying or producing the drugs\ncould face up to life in prison. Those caught in possession face seven years.\n\nAccording to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), China has\nbetween 40,000 and 100,000 pharmaceutical companies.\n\n\"China has long had one of the most significant pharmaceutical industries in\nAsia, as well as one of the largest chemical industries. And we've seen\nindustry growth in other countries of the region,\" said Jeremy Douglas in late\n2023, the then regional representative of the UNODC .\n\n\"While both industries are regulated, the challenge is significant given the\nsheer scale, and at the same time there are a number of ways to move products.\nParcel post, air freight and shipping containers are all moving globally in\nhigh volumes,\" he said.\n\nMr Douglas says that synthetic drugs are disrupting the traditional drug\ntrade. Outside of China, synthetic drugs offer opportunities for both\ntraditional crime organisations and upstarts able to buy directly from\nproducers half a world away.\n\n\"Synthetics like fentanyl have several advantages over traditional drugs -\ncompact, easily shippable, pre-existing demand, replaceable. They're\nattractive to traffickers.\"\n\nSynthetic opioids are powerful so can be shipped in small quantities\n\nThat was confirmed in my conversations with sales people working for Chinese\npharmaceutical firms.\n\n\"First of all, our packaging is completely secret, no one knows what it is\nuntil you open it, and second, we will change the name of the package and will\nnot reveal any name about the product,\" says Sara.\n\n\"We will get the logistics order number when we send the package, we will\ntrack the situation of the package at any time, and any anomalies can be known\nand solved in time,\" she adds.\n\nAccording to Europol, the European police agency, China is the world's biggest\nmanufacturer and distributor of synthetic, lab-made drugs. Some mimic the\neffects of traditional drugs like cannabis or cocaine. Chemists synthesise new\ndrugs in order to stay one step ahead of the law.\n\n\"It is criminal entrepreneurship, but in a legitimate framework which is\nreally unique,\" says Dr Louise Shelly the director of the Terrorism,\nTransnational Crime and Corruption Center (TraCCC) at George Mason University,\nand author of Dark Commerce.\n\n\"I have not seen such a professionalism and a corporate element in this\nanywhere else in the world. Criminal activity was a type of social mobility.\"\n\nIn 2020, researchers from TraCCC studied over 350 English language websites\nadvertising the synthetic opioid fentanyl. \"From all the adverts that we\nfound, nearly 40% of them were from corporate registries, and the largest hub\nof that was in Wuhan,\" says Dr Shelly.\n\nAlamy\n\nUS authorities intercept some synthetic opioids shipped from China\n\nThe sales people contacted by the BBC see the drug trade as simply another\naspect of e-commerce. When challenged over selling drugs that damage lives,\none described herself as a \"middleman.\"\n\n\"Somebody needs it, somebody makes it, and I am just a middleman who lets\ncustomers know that I have it and what they do with it, I don't care,\" she\nsays. \"Then I figured out I just need to make money. I don't know and don't\ncare. Everyone has their own needs.\"\n\nThe woman boasts of clients from Canada to Croatia. She provided photos of\nrecent drugs shipments complete with labels showing a UK address.\n\n\"I didn't know at first until I went online and translated the product into\nChinese,\" she says via a message punctuated with a teary emoji.\n\nAnother seller says: \"This industry is easy, and you can get higher wages,\nwhich attracts a large number of young people\". Natalie [not her real name],\nfocuses on fentanyl.\n\n\"We buy from over 10 different labs and have a large selection. I have a\nprofessional shipping agent who packaged goods so has a very high delivery\nsuccess rate to the UK.\"\n\nMeanwhile, another supplier claimed to be able to smuggle drugs into the UK\nhidden in dog food packaging. \"You don't need to worry about the packaging. We\nguarantee you safe delivery.\"\n\n\"We ship in large quantities all over the world every day. Please trust our\nprofessional team. We guarantee 100% safe transportation.\"\n\nIn 2019, the Chinese government banned all forms of fentanyl and its\nanalogues. In January 2024, China and the US launched a joint operation to\ncurb the production of the synthetic opioid fentanyl.\n\n\"As long as market demand remains high in some parts of the world then that\ndemand will be met in one way or another,\" said Mr Douglas from the UNODC.\n\nOpioids\n\nFentanyl\n\nDrugs trade\n\nTechnology of Business\n\nRelated\n\n## UK too slow to act on lethal drug threat - doctors\n\n20 Mar 2024\n\nUK\n\n## Codeine cough syrup abuse prompts ban on UK sales\n\n20 Feb 2024\n\nHealth\n\n## Plea for drug users to carry overdose life-saver\n\n17 Dec 2023\n\nIsle Of Man / Ellan Vannin\n\nMore\n\n2 days ago\n\n## 'Slaves' released during raid on cannabis factory\n\nPolice say Cambridgeshire incident highlights link between organised crime and\nmodern day slavery\n\n2 days ago\n\nCambridgeshire\n\n3 days ago\n\n## Police officer turned 'cannabis gardener' jailed\n\nA former police officer from Albania has been jailed for growing hundreds of\ncannabis plants in an industrial unit.\n\n3 days ago\n\nEdinburgh, Fife & East\n\n3 days ago\n\n## Drugs boss extradited from Portugal pleads guilty\n\nStephen Earle was described as a \"senior leader\" in a \"dangerous\" crime\norganisation.\n\n3 days ago\n\n5 days ago\n\n## The challenge of upgrading iconic steel windows\n\nCritall windows date back to the 1880s but their steel construction makes them\nvulnerable to damp.\n\n5 days ago\n\nBusiness\n\n5 days ago\n\n## Bogus removals man hid cocaine in piano\n\nFrancesco Role was caught when border security officers became suspicious of\nthe piano's weight.\n\n5 days ago\n\nManchester\n\n## Let us know you agree to cookies\n\nWe use cookies to give you the best online experience.\n\nPlease let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.\n\n  * No, take me to settings\n\n", "frontpage": false}
