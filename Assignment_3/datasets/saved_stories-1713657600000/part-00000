A standalone bill with a shorter,\nsix-month selling deadline passed the House in March by an overwhelming\nbipartisan vote as both Democrats and Republicans voiced national security\nconcerns about the app\u2019s owner, the Chinese technology firm ByteDance Ltd.\n\nThe modified measure, passed by a 360-58 vote, now goes to the Senate after\nnegotiations that lengthened the timeline for the company to sell to nine\nmonths, with a possible additional three months if a sale is in progress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nLegal challenges could extend that timeline even further. The company has\nindicated that it would likely go to court to try and block the law if it\npasses, arguing it would deprive the app\u2019s millions of users of their First\nAmendment rights.\n\nTikTok has lobbied hard against the legislation, pushing the app\u2019s 170 million\nU.S. users \u2014 many of whom are young \u2014 to call Congress and voice opposition.\nBut the ferocity of the pushback angered lawmakers on Capitol Hill, where\nthere is broad concern about Chinese threats to the U.S. and where few members\nuse the platform themselves.\n\n\u201cWe will not stop fighting and advocating for you,\u201d TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew\nsaid in a video that was posted on the platform last month and directed toward\nthe app\u2019s users. \u201cWe will continue to do all we can, including exercising our\nlegal rights, to protect this amazing platform that we have built with you.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe bill\u2019s quick path through Congress is extraordinary because it targets one\ncompany and because Congress has taken a hands-off approach to tech regulation\nfor decades. Lawmakers had failed to act despite efforts to protect children\nonline, safeguard users\u2019 privacy and make companies more liable for content\nposted on their platforms, among other measures. But the TikTok ban reflects\nwidespread concerns from lawmakers about China.\n\nMembers of both parties, along with intelligence officials, have worried that\nChinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over American user data or\ndirect the company to suppress or boost TikTok content favorable to its\ninterests. TikTok has denied assertions that it could be used as a tool of the\nChinese government and has said it has not shared U.S. user data with Chinese\nauthorities.\n\nThe U.S. government has not publicly provided evidence that shows TikTok\nshared U.S. user data with the Chinese government or tinkered with the\ncompany\u2019s popular algorithm, which influences what Americans see.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe company has good reason to think a legal challenge could be successful,\nhaving seen some success in previous legal fights over its operations in the\nU.S.. In November, a federal judge blocked a Montana law that would ban TikTok\nuse across the state after the company and five content creators who use the\nplatform sued.\n\nIn 2020, federal courts blocked an executive order issued by then-President\nDonald Trump to ban TikTok after the company sued on the grounds that the\norder violated free speech and due process rights. His administration brokered\na deal that would have had U.S. corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large\nstake in TikTok. The sale never went through for a number of reasons; one was\nChina, which imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers.\n\nDozens of states and the federal government have put in place TikTok bans on\ngovernment devices. Texas\u2019 ban was challenged last year by The Knight First\nAmendment Institute at Columbia University, which argued in a lawsuit that the\npolicy was impeding academic freedom because it extended to public\nuniversities. In December, a federal judge ruled in favor of the state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nOrganizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union have backed the app.\n\u201cCongress cannot take away the rights of over 170 million Americans who use\nTikTok to express themselves, engage in political advocacy, and access\ninformation from around the world,\u201d said Jenna Leventoff, a lawyer for the\ngroup.\n\nSince mid-March, TikTok has spent $5 million on TV ads opposing the\nlegislation, according to AdImpact, an advertising tracking firm. The ads have\nincluded a range of content creators, including a nun, extolling the positive\nimpacts of the platform on their lives and arguing a ban would trample on the\nFirst Amendment. The company has also encouraged its users to contact\nCongress, and some lawmakers have received profanity-laced calls.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that the House of Representatives is using the cover of\nimportant foreign and humanitarian assistance to once again jam through a ban\nbill that would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans,\ndevastate 7 million businesses, and shutter a platform that contributes $24\nbillion to the U.S. economy, annually,\u201d said Alex Haurek, a spokesman for the\ncompany.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nCalifornia Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democrat, voted against the legislation. He said\nhe thinks there could have been less restrictive ways to go after the company\nthat wouldn\u2019t result in a total ban or threaten free speech.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s not going to be well received,\u201d Khanna said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign of the\nBeltway being out of touch with where voters are.\u201d\n\nNadya Okamoto, a content creator who has roughly 4 million followers on\nTikTok, said she has been having conversations with other creators who are\nexperiencing \u201cso much anger and anxiety\u201d about the bill and how it\u2019s going to\nimpact their lives. The 26-year-old, whose company \u201cAugust\u201d sells menstrual\nproducts and is known for her advocacy around destigmatizing menstrual\nperiods, makes most of her income from TikTok.\n\n\u201cThis is going to have real repercussions,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nHadero reported from New York.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nTravel\n\nLocal guides, travel tips and the latest industry news\n\nAdvice|9 beach rules for not being the absolute worst\n\nAmsterdam blocks construction of new hotels to fight overtourism\n\nYou can still find affordable flights to Europe this summer\n\nback\n\nTry a different topic\n\nSign in or create a free account to save your preferences\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompany\n\n* About The Post\n* Newsroom Policies & Standards\n* Diversity & Inclusion\n* Careers\n* Media & Community Relations\n* WP Creative Group\n* Accessibility Statement\n* Sitemap\n\nGet The Post\n\n* Become a Subscriber\n* Gift Subscriptions\n* Mobile & Apps\n* Newsletters & Alerts\n* Washington Post Live\n* Reprints & Permissions\n* Post Store\n* Books & E-Books\n* Print Archives (Subscribers Only)\n* Today\u2019s Paper\n* Public Notices\n* Coupons\n\nContact Us\n\n* Contact the Newsroom\n* Contact Customer Care\n* Contact the Opinions Team\n* Advertise\n* Licensing & Syndication\n* Request a Correction\n* Send a News Tip\n* Report a Vulnerability\n\nTerms of Use\n\n* Digital Products Terms of Sale\n* Print Products Terms of Sale\n* Terms of Service\n* Privacy Policy\n* Cookie Settings\n* Submissions & Discussion Policy\n* RSS Terms of Service\n* Ad Choices\n\nwashingtonpost.com \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n\n  * washingtonpost.com\n  * \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n  * About The Post\n  * Contact the Newsroom\n  * Contact Customer Care\n  * Request a Correction\n  * Send a News Tip\n  * Report a Vulnerability\n  * Download the Washington Post App\n  * Policies & Standards\n  * Terms of Service\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Cookie Settings\n  * Print Products Terms of Sale\n  * Digital Products Terms of Sale\n  * Submissions & Discussion Policy\n  * RSS Terms of Service\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Coupons\n\n", "frontpage": false}
