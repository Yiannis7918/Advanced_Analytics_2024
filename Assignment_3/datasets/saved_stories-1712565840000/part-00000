However, little is known about the dynamic effects of IER on the\nbrain-gut-microbiome axis.\n\nMethods: In this study, a total of 25 obese individuals successfully lost\nweight after a 2-month IER intervention. FMRI was used to determine the\nactivity of brain regions. Metagenomic sequencing was performed to identify\ndifferentially abundant gut microbes and pathways in from fecal samples.\n\nResults: Our results showed that IER longitudinally reduced the activity of\nobese-related brain regions at different timepoints, including the inferior\nfrontal orbital gyrus in the cognitive control circuit, the putamen in the\nemotion and learning circuit, and the anterior cingulate cortex in the sensory\ncircuit. IER longitudinally reduced E. coli abundance across multiple\ntimepoints while elevating the abundance of obesity-related Faecalibacterium\nprausnitzii, Parabacteroides distasonis, and Bacterokles uniformis.\nCorrelation analysis revealed longitudinally correlations between gut bacteria\nabundance alterations and brain activity changes.\n\nConclusions: There was dynamical alteration of BGM axis (the communication of\nE. coli with specific brain regions) during the weight loss under the IER.\n\n## Introduction\n\nObesity is a challenging public health issue worldwide (Schwartz et al.,\n2017). Higher-order executive functions play important roles in successful\nweight loss and weight maintenance (Torres\u2013Fuentes et al., 2017; van de Wouw\net al., 2017; Frank et al., 2021). Functional magnetic resonance imaging\n(fMRI) studies have revealed that addiction-related brain regions, including\nthe reward, cognitive control, emotional, and sensory circuits, contributes to\nthe pathogenesis of obesity and weight management by regulating eating\nbehavior. The reward circuit including striatum, nucleus accumbens and ventral\ntegmental area, also known as appetite network, is mainly responsible for\nregulating the motivation for food (Torres\u2013Fuentes et al., 2017; van de Wouw\net al., 2017; Frank et al., 2021). The cognitive control circuit including\ndorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and anterior cingulate gyrus (ACC), is\nresponsible of self-limiting calorie intake (Torres\u2013Fuentes et al., 2017; van\nde Wouw et al., 2017; Frank et al., 2021). The emotional circuit is\nresponsible for the affective learning and memory of food cue (Torres\u2013Fuentes\net al., 2017; van de Wouw et al., 2017; Frank et al., 2021). The main nuclei\ninclude amygdala, hippocampus and putamen (Torres\u2013Fuentes et al., 2017; van de\nWouw et al., 2017; Frank et al., 2021). The sensory circuit including orbito\nfrontal cortex (OFC) and insula drive food intake and consumption\n(Torres\u2013Fuentes et al., 2017; van de Wouw et al., 2017; Frank et al., 2021).\nFor example, Hermann et al. have found that the striatum in the reward circuit\nresponds more strongly to high-calorie food at the early stage of calorie\nrestriction, predicting weight trajectory and weight-loss intervention\noutcomes (Hermann et al., 2019). Neseliler et al. have shown that the activity\nof the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in cognitive control circuit increases\nat one month after calorie restriction and returned to baseline at three\nmonths after calorie restriction, positively correlating with weight loss\n(Neseliler et al., 2019). However, the mechanism underlying the chronological\nchanges of the brain activity during calorie restriction remains unclear.\n\nThe central nervous system interacts with gut microbes through a bidirectional\nbrain-gut-microbiome (BGM) axis. Food intake affects the activity of brain\ncircuits that control energy balance (Clemmensen et al., 2017). Abnormal\nresponse of the brain circuits to nutritional signals alters eating behavior,\ncontributing to the development of obesity (Martin et al., 2018). Gut microbes\nregulate brain activity and eating behavior through multiple mechanisms.\nNeurotransmitters and neurotoxins produced by gut microbes in pathological\nstates have access to the central nervous system through the blood-brain\nbarrier, affecting brain function and then eating behavior (Holder and\nChassaing, 2018). Metabolic disorders resulting from the alteration in gut\nmicrobiota composition may affect the activity of the hypothalamus and other\ndiet-related brain regions through the vagus nerves or systemic circulation\n(Mishra et al., 2016; Mohajeri et al., 2018). Therefore, in obesity\nmanagement, the alteration in gut microbiota composition resulting from\ndietary intervention may maintain energy homeostasis by restoring BGM\ncommunication, thereby improving weight loss (van Son et al., 2021). However,\nthere is still a lack of understanding about the dynamic changes and the\nunderlying pathways of the BGM axis in dietary intervention.\n\nIntermittent energy restriction (IER) is defined as periods of restricted\nenergy intake followed by periods of normal energy intake. Studies have shown\nthat long-term IER (> 3 months) is an effective weight loss strategy (Harvie\nand Howell, 2016; Sch\u00fcbel et al., 2018; Dong et al., 2020). In this study,\nusing fMRI and metagenomic sequencing, we investigated the dynamic effects of\na short-term (2-month) IER intervention on the BGM axis in obese individuals.\nOur study identified differentially abundant gut microbes and potential\npathways underlying the temporal changes in the BGM axis in response to IER,\nproviding new information about the role of the BGM axis in weight loss.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Study approval\n\nThis study was approved by the Ethics. This study was registered at\nhttps://clinicaltrials.gov. All procedures were performed following relevant\nethical regulations, Helsinki Declaration, and privacy legislation. All\nparticipants provided written informed consent.\n\n### Subjects\n\nA total of 25 obese adults with body mass index (BMI) ranging from 28 to 45\nkg/m^2 were recruited from hospitals from April to November 2018. The\nrecruitment process has shown in Supplementary Figure S1. All patients had\nwell-controlled hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypeluricemia, or\nmetabolic syndrome. The individuals with serious cardiopathy, liver\ndysfunction, renal disease, hypoglycemia, anemia, malnutrition, hemopoietic\nsystem disease, systemic immune system disease, infectious disease, or\nneurological disorders were excluded. All participants provided written\ninformed consent.\n\n### IER protocol\n\nAs shown in Figure 1A, in phase I, the participants were on normal diet\nwithout restriction on calories and food types for four days. The average\ndaily energy intake of each subject was recorded according to 24-h dietary\nrecalls for four days as their basic energy intake (Park et al., 2018). The\nIER meals were formulated by a clinical dietitian based on each participant\u2019s\nbasic energy intake and provided to each participant on the energy-restricted\ndiet day. Each meal consisted of 55% carbohydrates, 15% protein and 30% fat.\nThe phase II which is the high-controlled fasting phase included 32 days (8 d\neach stage, 4 stages in total).At stage 1, 2, 3 and 4, patients were provided\nwith 2/3, 1/2, 1/3 and 1/4 of each participant\u2019s basic energy intake\nrespectively. Patients ate independently without restriction on every other\nunrestricted energy intake day at home. The Phase III was the low-controlled\nfasting phase which includes 30 days. During the Phase III, the meals were not\nprovided to the participants. They were gave a list of food (consisted of 55%\ncarbohydrates, 15% protein and 30% fat) to have and asked to have energy-\nrestricted diet (600 call/day for men, 500 call/day for women) on the\nalternating day at home. The feces and blood samples were collected before\nphase I (baseline), at the midpoint (HC-W2) and endpoint (HC-W4) of phase II,\nand at the endpoint of phase III (LC-W4).\n\nFigure 1\n\nFigure 1 Clinical parameters of participants. (A) Study design. A total of 35\nobese adults completed a three-phase intermittent energy restriction (IER). In\nthe 4-day phase I, the subjects were on normal diet without restriction on\ncalories or food types. In the 31-day highly-controlled phase II, the\nparticipants were on a diet at 2/3, 1/2, 1/3, and 1/4 of the normal caloric\nintake every other day for 7\u20138 days, respectively. In the 30-day lowly-\ncontrolled phase III, the participants were on a calorie-restricted diet (600\nkal/day for men, and 500 kal/day for women) every other day. A total of 25\nparticipants with obesity successfully achieved weight loss after intermittent\nenergy restriction (IER) intervention. (B\u2013U) Obesity-related clinical\nparameters were measured at baseline, midpoint and endpoint of phase II, and\nendpoint of phase III. HC-W2, midpoint of highly-controlled phase II; HC-W4,\nendpoint of highly-controlled phase II; LC-W4, endpoint of lowly-controlled\nphase III. Data are expressed as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation. *P < 0.05, **P\n< 0.01 vs. baseline; n = 25.\n\n### Measurement of clinical parameters\n\nBody weight, waist circumference, body fat, systolic blood pressure, and\ndiastolic blood pressure were measured at baseline, midpoint and endpoint of\nphase II, and endpoint of phase III. Blood samples were collected in the\nmorning after overnight fasting at different timepoints as above mentioned.\nSerum was obtained by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 15 min at 23\u00b0C and\nstored at -80\u00b0C until use. Serum levels of fasting plasma glucose,\nglycosylated hemoglobin, total cholesterol, glutamyl transpeptidase, high-\ndensity lipoproteins, low-density lipoproteins, aspartate aminotransferase,\nalanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine, and uric acid were\nmeasured by the Laboratory of Hospital.\n\n### fMRI\n\nBrain activity was recorded by resting-state fMRI. The parameters were Repeat\ntime (TR) = 2000 ms, Echo Time (TE) = 35 ms, Field of View (FOV) = 220 mm\u00d7220\nmm, matrix size = 94\u00d794, slices = 75, slice thickness = 2.2 mm, flip angle =\n80\u00b0, and Simultaneous MultiSlice (SMS) factor = 3. The regional homogeneity\n(ReHo) was measured based on Kendall\u2019s coefficient concordance as previously\ndescribed (Zang et al., 2004). Data were analyzed using DPABI\n(http://rfmri.org/dpabi) and SPM12 (www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). Briefly,\nDICOM-format data were converted to NIFTI-format. After discarding the 10\ninitial scans, data were subjected to slice-timing and head motion correction.\nData were then normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute standard\nspace by linearly registering using echo-planar imaging (EPI) template. After\nsmoothing the data using a 6 mm full width at half maximum, data were\ndetrended to eliminate the linear trend of time courses and filtered with low\nfrequency fluctuations (0.01-0.08 Hz). Six head motion parameters, white\nmatter mask, the whole-brain mask, and cerebrospinal fluid mask were regressed\nout of the EPI time series. Five participants with abnormal head motion\nparameters (displacement > 2 mm and/or rotation > 2 degrees) were excluded.\n\nThe resting-state ReHo maps were collected. The ReHo values were compared\nusing paired t-test. The region of interest was selected as follows: first,\nthe peak point of the paired t-test results was set as the center of the\nregion of interest; second, the brain regions that were not included in the\npaired t-test but important for obesity research were selected. The regions of\ninterest were stored as the mask of seed points by Anatomical Automatic\nLabeling (AAL) template, followed by loading into the results of the paired\nt-test. The activity of corresponding brain regions was obtained, and the peak\ncoordinates and t values of the brain regions were found.\n\n### Metagenomic sequencing\n\nFecal samples from 25 participants who successfully lost weight were subjected\nto metagenomic sequencing. Genomic DNA was isolated from fecal samples using\nMagen Magpure stool DNA KF kit B (Magen, China) following the manufacturer\u2019s\ninstructions. A paired-end DNA library with insert size of 250 bp was\nconstructed. The DNA libraries were sequenced with paired-end reads of 2 \u00d7 100\nbp on the BGISEQ-500 platform (BGISEQ, China).\n\nSequencing data were processed using KneadData v0.7.2\n(https://bitbucket.org/biobakery/kneaddata/wiki/Home) as previously described\n(Liu et al., 2021). Briefly, the raw reads with 50% low quality bases (quality\n\u2264 20) or more than five ambiguous bases were excluded. The remaining reads\nwere mapped to the human genome (hg19) using Short Oligonucleotide Analysis\nPackage (SOAP) v2.22 (-m 100 -x 600 -v 7 -p 6 -l 30 -r 1 -M 4 -c 0.95), and\nthe matching reads were removed. The high-quality non-human reads were\nconsidered clean reads. The clean reads were aligned against 11.4 M human gut\nmicrobial gene catalog using SOAP v2.22 (-m 100 -x 600 -v 7 -p 6 -l 30 -r 1 -M\n4 -c 0.9) to generate the gene abundance profile. To obtain the taxonomic\nprofiles, metaphlan2 (\u2013input_type fastq \u2013ignore_viruses \u2013nproc 6) was used to\ngenerate species profile.\n\nThe raw sequence data reported in this paper have been deposited in the Genome\nSequence Archive (Genomics, Proteomics & Bioinformatics 2021) in National\nGenomics Data Center (Nucleic Acids Res 2022), China National Center for\nBioinformation / Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences\n(GSA: CRA013299) that are publicly accessible at https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gsa\n(Chen et al., 2021; CNCB-NGDC Members and Partners, 2023).\n\n### Gut microbiota diversity analysis\n\nAlpha diversity (within samples) was assessed by Shannon index. Beta diversity\n(between samples) was assessed by Bray-Curti\u2019s dissimilarity based non-metric\nmultidimensional scaling (NMDS). Data were analyzed using R 3.2.5, vegan\npackage 2.4-4.\n\n### Differentially abundant microbial species and pathways\n\nDifferentially abundant Gut microbial species and pathways were identified by\nlinear discriminant analysis (LDA). Logarithmic LDA scores threshold was 2.0.\nKruskal-wallis test threshold was P < 0.05.\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nThe measurement data were expressed as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation.\nStatistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 17.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL,\nUSA). Data with normal distributions were analyzed using ANOVA and two-tailed\nStudent\u2019s t-test. Nonnormal distributions were compared using Mann-Whitney,\nKolmogorov-Smirnov, or Wald- Wolfowitz test. The ReHo values were compared\nusing paired t-test and subjected to Gaussian random field correction. NMDS\ndata was compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Kruskal-wallis rank sum\ntest. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The correlations\nbetween gut microbiota and fMRI results were analyzed by Spearman\u2019s rank\ncorrelation. Spearman`s correlation coefficient \u2265 0.2 and P < 0.05 were\nconsidered significant correlation.\n\n## Results\n\n### IER reduces obesity and improves obesity-related clinical parameters\n\nAs shown in Supplementary Figure S1, a total of 41 participants were\nrecruited, 35 completed the IER, and 25 successfully lost weight as evidenced\nby continuous, significant reductions in body weights during IER intervention\n(all P < 0.01 vs. baseline; Figure 1B). In the 25 participants, by comparing\nwith baseline parameters, we observed sustained, significant reductions in\nbody mass index, body fat, waist circumference, percent of body fat, skeletal\nmuscle (all P < 0.001), systolic blood pressure (all P < 0.05), and serum\nlevels of glycosylated hemoglobin (all P < 0.05) and glutamyl transpeptidase\n(all P < 0.01) during IER intervention. The body weight of obese participants\nafter IER intervention were significantly lower than those before\nintervention[(89.92 \u00b1 14.98) vs. (97.53 \u00b1 15.67) kg, P < 0.001]. In addition,\ndiastolic blood pressure and serum levels of fasting plasma glucose, total\ncholesterol, high-density lipoproteins, low-density lipoproteins, alanine\naminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase were\nsignificantly decreased on at least one time point during IER (all P < 0.05;\nFigures 1C\u2013U). These data suggest that IER not only reduces obesity but also\nalleviates obesity-related comorbidities such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia,\nand liver dysfunction.\n\n### IER intervention reduces the activity of brain regions related to eating\nbehavior\n\nThen, we performed resting-state fMRI to explore the effect of IER on brain\nactivity. Representative fMRI images are shown in Figures 2A\u2013F. Statistical\nanalysis of ReHo values is shown in Table S1. We found significant decreases\nin the Reho values of the left inferior frontal orbital gyrus (Figure S2D) and\nputamen (Figure S2B) at midpoint and endpoint of phase II, respectively,\ncompared with those at baseline. We also observed significant decreases in the\nReho values of the right inferior frontal orbital gyrus (Figure S2A), anterior\ncingulate cortex (Figure S2C), left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Figure\nS2D), and right putamen (Figure S2F) at endpoint of phase III, compared with\nthose at baseline (Figure S2). These brain regions are responsible for\ncognitive control, emotion and learning memory, as well as sensory (Volkow et\nal., 2003; Dagher, 2012; Ochner et al., 2013; Gettens and Gorin, 2017). No\nsignificant changes were observed in brain activity of the reward circuit or\nother brain regions (Figure S2). These data suggest that IER reduces the\nactivity of brain regions related to the regulation of food intake, thus\ncontributing to successful weight loss and maintenance.\n\nFigure 2\n\nFigure 2 Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). (A\u2013F) fMRI was\nconducted to assess brain activity in the left inferior frontal orbital gyrus\n(A), putamen (B), right putamen (C), right inferior frontal orbital gyrus (D),\nleft dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (E), and anterior cingulate cortex (F) of\nobese participants in response to IER. The regional homogeneity (ReHo) was\nmeasured to compare brain activity at midpoint of phase II (A), upper),\nendpoint of phase II (B), upper), and endpoint of phase III (C\u2013F), upper) with\nthat at baseline (A\u2013F), lower). Blue denotes decreased ReHo values. Red\ndenotes increased ReHo values. z: the number of axial layers; x: the number of\nsagittal layers.\n\n### IER increases gut microbial diversity\n\nTo explore the effect of IER on gut microbiota in obese patients, we performed\nmetagenomic sequencing and bioinformatics analyses. Shannon diversity analysis\nat the species level showed that the gut microbial species at endpoint of\nphase II was significantly increased compared with that at baseline or\nmidpoint of phase II. The gut microbial species at the end of phase III was\nsignificantly decreased compared with that at the end of phase II. No\nsignificant difference was observed in the gut microbial diversities between\nbaseline and the end of phase III (Figure 3A). Bray-Curtis dissimilarity\nanalysis showed that the gut microbiota of obese individuals at phase II and\nphase III clustered together (Figures 3B, S3B). These data suggest that IER\nintervention increases gut microbial richness and diversity in obese\nindividuals.\n\nFigure 3\n\nFigure 3 Diversity analysis of gut microbiota based on metagenomic sequencing.\n(A) Shannon indexes (alpha diversity) of the gut microbiota at the species\nlevel. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01; n = 25. (B) Bray-Curtis dissimilarity (beta\ndiversity) based on non-metric multidimensional scaling. NMDS, non-metric\nmultidimensional scaling. ns, none significance.\n\n### IER dynamically alters the abundance of obesity-related gut bacteria\n\nNext, we sought to identify differentially abundant gut microbial species and\npathways during IER. The results of LDA showed that food-borne pathogenic\nEscherichia coli was the most abundant species in the gut microbiota of obese\nindividuals at baseline (Figures 4A\u2013C). IER dramatically reduced E. coli\nabundance across multiple timepoints (Figure 4E). On the other hand, compared\nwith those at baseline, obesity-related Faecalibacterium prausnitzii,\nParabacteroides distasonis, and Bacterokles uniformis were remarkably\nincreased in gut microbiota of obese individuals during phase II (all P <\n0.05; Figure 4D), peaking at midpoint of phase II and then gradually\ndecreasing to near baseline levels. No significant differences were observed\nin the abundance of F. prausnitzii and P. distasonis between endpoints of\nphase II and phases III. Similar trends were observed in the abundance of\nClostridium leptum, Flavonifractor plautii, Bacterokles intestinalls,\nOdoribacter splanchnicus, and Clostridium citroniae (Figure 4D).\n\nFigure 4\n\nFigure 4 Identification of differentially abundant gut bacteria during IER.\n(A\u2013C) Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was performed to identify\ndifferentially abundant gut bacteria at midpoint of phase II (A), endpoint of\nphase II (B), and endpoint of phase III (C) compared with those at baseline.\nThe species with LDA score (log 10) > 2.0 and P < 0.05 (Kruskal-wallis test)\nwere considered differentially abundant bacteria. (D) The abundance of\nrepresentative differentially abundant gut bacteria during IER. (E) Gut\nEscherichia coli abundance during IER. LDA, linear discriminant analysis.\n\n### Gut microbiota alterations are associated with brain activity changes\nacross different timepoints during IER intervention\n\nConsidering the important role of the BGM axis in weight maintenance, we\ninvestigated the dynamic correlation between differentially abundant gut\nbacteria and the brain regions responding to IER. The results showed that at\nbaseline, the abundance of E. coli, C. comes, and E. hallii were negatively\ncorrelated with the activity of left orbital inferior frontal gyrus whereas\nthe abundance of P. distasonis and F. plautii were positively correlated with\nthe activity of right orbital inferior frontal gyrus and right putamen,\nrespectively (Figure 5A). At midpoint of phase II, the abundance of B.\nintestinalis was negatively correlated with the activity of anterior cingulate\ngyrus whereas the abundance of C. leptum and O. splanchnicus were positively\ncorrelated with the activity of putamen and left orbital inferior frontal\ngyrus, respectively (Figure 5B). At endpoint of phase II, the abundance of B.\ncaccae and B. thetaiotaomicron were negatively correlated with the activity of\nleft orbital inferior frontal gyrus, the B. thetaiotaomicron abundance was\nnegatively correlated with the activity of anterior cingulate gyrus, and the\nC. comes abundance was positively correlated with the activity of putamen\n(Figure 5C). At endpoint of phase III, the abundance of E. coli, P.\ndistasonis, and F. plautiiwere were negatively correlated with the activity of\nright putamen, left dorsolateral prefrontal lobe, and right orbital inferior\nfrontal gyrus, respectively, whereas the abundance of S. salivarius and F.\nplautii were positively correlated with the activity of right orbital inferior\nfrontal gyrus and putamen, respectively (Figure 5D). The differential microbes\nwere Coprococcus comes at baseline, Bacteroides uniformis and Parabacteroides\ndistasonis at HC-W2, and Eubacterium Hallii and Agathobaculum\nbutyriciproducens at HC-W4 (Figure S3). These data suggest that IER induces a\ndynamic interaction between the brain and gut microbiota.\n\nFigure 5\n\nFigure 5 Correlation between differentially abundant gut bacteria and brain\nregions responding to IER. Spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to\nassess the correlation between differentially abundant gut bacteria and brain\nregions responding to IER at baseline (A), midpoint (B) and endpoint (C) of\nphase II, and endpoint of phase III (D). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. AAL Template\nnames were used in all brain regions.\n\n## Discussion\n\nIn this study, we described the dynamic effects of a short-term IER\nintervention on the BGM axis in obese individuals. We observed that IER\ninduced constant, significant reductions in the activity of eating behavior-\nrelated brain regions, including the right inferior frontal orbital gyrus,\nanterior cingulate cortex, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and right\nputamen. We also found that IER induced significant, dynamic changes in the\nabundance of some gut bacteria, including pathogenic E. coli and obesity-\nrelated probiotics F. prausnitzii, P. distasonis, and B. uniformis.\nImportantly, gut microbiota alterations correlated with brain activity changes\nacross different timepoints in IER intervention. These data suggest that the\ndynamic interplay between the brain and gut microbiota plays an important role\nin weight loss.\n\nWe used fMRI to describe IER-induced dynamic changes in brain activity. At\nmidpoint of phase II, we only observed significant reduction in the activity\nof the left inferior frontal orbital gyrus belonging to the OFC in the sensory\nand drive circuit. The OFC is related to the pleasure caused by the smell and\ntaste of food, integrating sensory organs such as mouth, nose and eyes with\nfine-tune eating decisions through interaction with brain regions including\nthalamus, midbrain, and striatum (Seabrook and Borgland, 2020). Studies have\nshown enhanced OFC activity in obese persons in response to visual food cues\ncompared with that in healthy controls (Pursey et al., 2014) and positive\ncorrelation between OFC activity and BMI (Batterink et al., 2010). In\naddition, OFC belongs to the emotion-driven \u201chot-system\u201d that rapidly responds\nto environmental changes (Metcalfe and Mischel, 1999), consistent with our\nfinding that OFC was the first brain region responding to IER. Thus, in our\nstudy, the decreased activity of the left inferior frontal orbital gyrus in\nthe early phase of IER may promote weight loss by reducing food intake.\n\nAt endpoint of phase II, we observed a significant reduction in the activity\nof putamen in the emotion and learning memory network. Putamen is involved in\nlearning and memory regards to food-cue (Volkow et al., 2011). It has been\nreported that the body weight increases with increasing response of the\nputamen to food-cue (Cerolini et al., 2017). The putamen activity negatively\ncorrelates with weight loss (Berthoud, 2011). Putamen activity decreases in\nobese patients at one month after sleeve gastrectomy, positively correlating\nwith the BMI reduction (Gu et al., 2020). These reports are consistent with\nour finding that the putamen activity decreased at endpoint of IER,\ncontributing to weight loss in obese participants.\n\nAt endpoint of phase III, we observed significant reductions in the activity\nof the DLPFC and ACC in the cognitive control network. DLPFC and ACC are\ninvolved in inhibition of food intake (Lavagnino et al., 2016), belonging to\nthe \u201ccool- system\u201d that is related to the self-control ability (Metcalfe and\nMischel, 1999). DLPFC impairment may increase BMI in healthy adults (Raji et\nal., 2010). ACC shrinks in obese patients, and the volume of ACC negatively\ncorrelates with the ability of subjects to control food intake (Brooks et al.,\n2013). Structural connection between DLPFC and ACC negatively correlates with\nthe desire for high-calorie food (Hu et al., 2021). In our study, the activity\nof DLPFC and ACC decreased at the end of lowly-controlled phase III,\nsuggesting that for weight maintenance, it is important to enforce the\nactivity of and the connection between DLPFC and ACC. Long-term follow-up\nstudies have shown significant changes in reward network during weight loss\n(Murdaugh et al., 2012; Li et al., 2018). However, we did not observe\nsignificant alterations in the activity of reward network during the short-\nterm IER intervention, suggesting that the reward network might be involved in\na long-term dietary intervention.\n\nAs a vital component of the BGM axis, gut microbiota exhibited dynamic\nalterations in the abundance and diversity during IER in this study. At\nmidpoint of phase II, the abundance of obesity-related probiotics including F.\nprausnitzii, P. distasonis, and B. uniformis significantly increased compared\nwith that at baseline, whereas the abundance of pathogenic E. coli\nsignificantly decreased. Consistent with our findings, studies have indicated\nthat E. coli abundance is related to the obesity pathogenesis and dietary\nbehavior (Nilsson et al., 2001; Andr\u00e9 et al., 2014; Lima and Fonteles, 2014).\nNutritional factors can regulate E. coli proliferation, affecting the release\nof glucagon-like peptide-1 that induces intestinal satiety and dietary\ntermination signals (Peek et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020). On the contrary, F.\nprausnitzii, P. distasonis, and B. uniformis can reduce obesity and alleviate\nobesity-related metabolic and immune disorders (Gauffin Cano et al., 2012;\nWang et al., 2019; Schroder et al., 2020). Thus, our findings suggest that the\nalteration in gut microbiota in response to IER promotes weight loss.\nInterestingly, the reduction in E.coli abundance sustained to the endpoint of\nphase III, whereas the abundance of F. prausnitzii, P. distasonis, and B.\nuniformis peaked at midpoint of phase II and declined to near baseline levels\nat endpoint of phase III. These results demonstrate that gut microbiota of\nobese individuals rapidly responds to IER at the early stage, consistent with\nprevious reports (Wu et al., 2011; Kusumoto et al., 2017; Asnicar et al.,\n2021). The rise-and-fall pattern of obesity-related probiotics suggests that\ngut microbiota is a highly plastic system as indicated by other studies. For\nexample, the Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio is altered within a week by\ndietary change but remain comparable to baseline level at 2 weeks after\ndietary intervention (Grembi et al., 2020). Long-term dietary intervention\nexerts a sustained impact on gut microbiota whereas short-term dietary change\nonly causes rapid and temporary changes in gut microbiota (Wu et al., 2011;\nGrembi et al., 2020). Thus, for weight loss maintenance, a highly-controlled\nlong-term IER intervention is recommended.\n\nDespite the rigid connection between gut microbiota and the brain in early\nlife, the BGM axis exhibits plasticity in adults, playing a prominent role in\nregulating food intake and keeping body weight stable (Junges et al., 2018).\nThe chemical signals produced by gut microbiota determine eating behavior\nthrough interactions with the brain. Considering the important role of the BGM\naxis in obesity and weight loss, we explored the association between brain\nnetworks and gut microbiota during IER. We observed significant correlations\nbetween certain brain regions and differentially abundant gut bacteria across\ndifferent timepoints of IER. For instance, the E coli abundance was negatively\nassociated with the left orbital inferior frontal gyrus in the inhibitory\ncontrol circuit at base line and the right putamen in the learning and memory\ncircuit at endpoint of phase III. E. coli can regulate the anorexia and\nappetite pathways by penetrating the blood-brain barrier to affect brain\nfunction and modulating the expression of appetite-regulating neuropeptides.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, we described a short-term IER-induced dynamic changes in the\nBGM axis in obese individuals who successfully lost weight after the\nintervention. We identified the brain regions and differentially abundant gut\nbacterial species responding to IER at different IER timepoints and revealed a\ndynamic correlation between the brain and gut microbiota.\n\n### Limitations of the study\n\nThe last measurements were taken at 30 days after the IER. Further follow-up\nstudy is needed for revealing the BGM axis dynamical alteration which affect\nthe long-term weight loss. In this study, it mainly aims at the specific BGM\naxis changes during the weight loss under the IER. The results provided\nprimary insights for potential BGM axis changed during weight loss, and did\nnot establish causation. The animal model is need to validate the BGM changes\nfor more understanding about how these certain brain area activity work with\nspecific gut flora in the weight loss.\n\n## Data availability statement\n\nThe raw sequence data reported in this paper have been deposited in the Genome\nSequence Archive (Genomics, Proteomics & Bioinformatics 2021) in National\nGenomics Data Center (Nucleic Acids Res 2022), China National Center for\nBioinformation / Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences\n(GSA: CRA013299) that are publicly accessible at https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gsa.\n\n## Ethics statement\n\nThe studies involving humans were approved by the Ethics Committee of Henan\nProvincial People\u2019s Hospital, People\u2019s Hospital of Zhengzhou University, and\nZhengzhou People\u2019s Hospital (Henan, China).
