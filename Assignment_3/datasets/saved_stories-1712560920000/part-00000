Renewable methanol is widely considered a\npromising fuel for powering heavy-duty applications like shipping, freight\ntransport, agriculture, and industrial machines due to its various sustainable\nproduction methods. While current technological efforts focus mainly on dual-\nfuel engines in shipping, future progress hinges on single-fuel solutions\nusing renewable methanol to achieve net-zero goals in the heavy-duty sector.\nThis review examines the research status of technologies enabling methanol as\nthe sole fuel for heavy-duty applications. Three main categories emerged from\nthe literature: spark-ignition, compression-ignition, and pre-chamber systems.\nEach concept\u2019s operational principles and characteristics regarding\nefficiency, stability, and emissions were analyzed. Spark-ignition concepts\nare a proven and cost-effective solution with high maturity. However, they\nface limitations due to knock issues, restricting power output with larger\nbore sizes. Compression-ignition concepts inherently do not suffer from end-\ngas autoignition, but encounter challenges related to ignitability due to the\nlow cetane number of methanol. Nonetheless, various methods for achieving\nautoignition of methanol exist. To obtain stable combustion at all load\npoints, a combination of techniques will be required. Pre-chamber technology,\ndespite its lower maturity, holds promise for extending the knock limit and\nenhancing efficiency by acting as a distributed ignition source. Furthermore,\nmixing-controlled pre-chamber concepts show potential for eliminating knock\nand the associated size and power limitations. The review concludes by\ncomparing each technology and identifying research gaps for future work.\n\nKeywords:\n\nmethanol; internal combustion engines; heavy-duty; single-fuel\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nFor decades, fossil fuels have fulfilled around 80% of the total energy demand\nof the world [1]. Despite the rapid growth in electrification and renewables\nbeginning to reduce this dominant share, the effect is not so obvious in the\nnon-road transport sector, such as aviation, shipping, agriculture, and\nindustrial machinery, since batteries simply cannot meet the required energy\ndensity for these heavy-duty (HD) applications. As promised by the COP28\nconsensus [2], the world should be transitioning away from fossil fuels,\nmeaning the gap left behind for these HD applications needs to be filled by\nclean fuels that can be produced sustainably and in an environmentally\nfriendly manner [3].\n\nMethanol is one of the promising candidates for this role. First and foremost,\nit can be carbon-neutral via multiple sustainable production routes [4].\nCurrently, the industrial process for producing methanol utilizes synthesis\ngas (syngas), a mixture of hydrogen (H_2), carbon monoxide (CO), and carbon\ndioxide (CO_2), as feedstock, which is converted into methanol. The conversion\nprocess involves the following three reactions [5]:\n\n  * CO hydrogenation:\n\n  * CO_2 hydrogenation:\n\n  * Water\u2013gas shift reaction:\n\nWhen the syngas is produced from biomass, such as by reforming biogas or by\ngasifying woody residue, the product is the so-called bio-methanol. When the\nsyngas is composed of H_2 from water electrolysis powered by renewable\nelectricity and CO_2 captured from the atmosphere, the product is the so-\ncalled e-methanol. Being able to be produced by these two sustainable pathways\nputs methanol in an interesting position. This is because there are concerns\non whether renewable electricity could scale up quickly enough to meet the\nhigh energy demand of e-fuel production [6,7], and if it does, whether it\nshould be prioritized to electrify other applications instead of fuel\nproduction [8]. Similarly, for biofuel, there is a concern that the valuable\nbiomass resources should be prioritized to other sectors [9,10], and there is\nalso a common belief that the limited biomass availability cannot meet much of\nthe total fuel demand; hence, its contribution to carbon-neutrality is\nconstrained [11]. Among these debates, relying on more than one sustainable\nresource obviously lowers the risk of mass-producing renewable methanol. It is\nalso worth pointing out that a hybrid production pathway integrating both\nthermochemical biorefinery and renewable electrolytic hydrogen could be an\nattractive solution, as it boosts the fuel yield and carbon conversion per\nbiomass input, which leads to a lower consumption of the scarce biomass\nresources [12,13]. While the above statement also applies to long-chain\nhydrocarbon fuels synthesized by the Fischer\u2013Tropsch process [14], methanol\nsynthesis usually has a 6 to 7 percentage point higher process efficiency due\nto its simpler molecular structure [15,16].\n\nThe oxygenated nature of methanol also means its combustion generates less\npollutant emissions compared to hydrocarbon fuels like diesel and gasoline.\nThanks to the facts that there is no carbon\u2013carbon bond in a methanol molecule\nand its only carbon atom is bonded with an oxygen atom, methanol combustion\ntends to be more complete and generates lower unburned hydrocarbon (HC) and CO\nemissions. Combining with its higher ignition delay, which promotes better\nmixture formation, the soot emission is even negligible. Moreover, its strong\nevaporative cooling effect, low adiabatic flame temperature, and high heat\ncapacity of its burned gas all contribute to reducing the cylinder\ntemperature, which leads to much lower thermal nitrogen oxide (NO_x) formation\n[17]. Table 1 summarizes the properties of methanol compared to other\nrenewable fuel candidates and conventional fossil fuels.\n\nTable 1. Summary of properties of different fuels.\n\nFueling HD applications with methanol has already been proven in the shipping\nsector. Since methanol fuel contains no sulfur, it easily meets the\nrequirement of the sulfur cap implemented by IMO in 2020. The adoption of\nmethanol-fueled vessels has since increased steadily. As of today, there are\n29 methanol-fueled vessels that are in operation and 228 on order [23]. With\n138 of them ordered in 2023, methanol has overtaken liquefied natural gas\n(LNG) as the new favorite alternative marine fuel [24]. Another advantage of\nmethanol that largely contributes to its popularity as a marine fuel is that\nit is a liquid under ambient conditions. The high cost and complexity of\nhandling and storing other gaseous candidates such as LNG, liquefied H_2, and\nammonia (NH_3) can thus be spared. Although its lower energy density compared\nto diesel may result in a reduced range, this can be compensated for by more\nfrequent refueling or larger fuel tanks. The fact that methanol biodegrades\neasily and thus poses lower harm to aquatic ecosystems should spillage occur\nalso enables more freedom in terms of methanol storage layout onboard a\nvessel.\n\nThe methanol-fueled vessels sailing on the water today are predominantly\npowered by internal combustion engines, but fuel cell is also an option [25].\nThese vessels come in various sizes, ranging from a smaller pilot boat powered\nby a four-stroke engine [26] to a much larger container ship powered by a two-\nstroke engine [27]. However, regardless of the number of strokes, the engines\npowering these vessels utilize predominantly dual-fuel (DF) technology. In DF\nengines, methanol combustion is initiated by a small quantity of diesel\ninjection in the cylinder, as methanol is more difficult to autoignite\ncompared to diesel. Retaining a diesel injector enables these engines a\nfavorable redundancy to operate in diesel-only mode also. This operating\nflexibility is crucial at the moment as the supplies of carbon-neutral\nmethanol at ports today are still highly volatile. Due to the fossil-based\nnature of diesel, it is obvious that the level of defossilization when\noperating DF engines depends on the fraction of (carbon-neutral) methanol\nused. This can usually be quantified by the methanol energy fraction (MEF), as\ndefined in Equation (4),\n\nwhere are the fuel flows and LHV are the lower heating values.\n\nAs the popularity of methanol fuel grows, more and more four-stroke DF engines\nappear on the market, and their development is in full swing [28,29,30,31].\nWhile the maximum MEF achieved on these engines can exceed 90% [30,31,32], it\nis not a simple task to maintain a similar MEF level across the full load\nrange. Methanol has a high heat of vaporization (HoV), which poses problems in\nachieving a high MEF when operating at low load, since the vaporization of\nmethanol could reduce the cylinder temperature substantially and cause\nincomplete combustion [33,34]. As for high-load operation, depending on the\nhomogeneity of the air\u2013methanol mixture inside the combustion chamber, both\nexcessive pressure rise rate and autoignition of unburned mixture could\nprevent achieving a high methanol fraction [35]. These constraints imply that\nthe optimal window for high MEF operation in DF engines can be narrow and may\nnot be suitable for applications where high- and low-load operations are\nemphasized. In addition, involving diesel in the operation offsets the low\nemission advantage of methanol, and expensive exhaust aftertreatment systems\n(EATS) are still required to handle the soot and NO_x emissions from diesel\ncombustion.\n\nThere is no denying that the DF approach is the best technology today to\nintroduce renewable methanol into fleets and move them towards a net-zero\nfuture, but it should only be considered a bridging technology before the\nsupply of renewable methanol gradually scales up and stabilizes. Moreover,\nother HD applications may not be able to afford the luxury of implementing a\nsecond fuel system on board as the marine industry does. Therefore, the\nresearch and development should move beyond DF technology, and it is\nenvisioned that a dedicated single-fuel solution that does away with the need\nfor two separate fuel systems will be desired in the future. Currently,\nmultiple potential technologies that enable single-fuel methanol engines for\nHD applications are being explored. This review aims at reporting the status\nquo of their development progress and pinpointing their research gaps. These\npotential technologies can be categorized by how the air\u2013methanol mixture is\nignited in the combustion chamber, namely, either by a spark, by compression,\nor by jets created by a pre-chamber. These three different technologies are\nfurther introduced and discussed in the following sections. Appendix A, which\nlists the current European emissions standards regulating on-road and off-road\nHD applications, can be used as references to benchmark the emissions\nmeasurements reported below.\n\n## 2\\. Spark-Ignition\n\nIn spark-ignition (SI) engines, air and fuel are premixed and then ignited by\na spark plug in the cylinder. The premixing process can take place either\nupstream of the cylinder or inside the cylinder. The former configuration is\ntermed port-fuel-injection (PFI) since fuel is injected close to the intake\nport, while the latter configuration is termed direct-injection (DI) since\nfuel is injected directly in the cylinder. Different injection locations\nresult in different injection pressures. PFI fuel systems (including pumps and\npiping) usually employ an injection pressure below 50 bar, as they only need\nto cope with the boost pressure in the intake path. On the other hand, DI\nsystems usually employ an injection pressure above 100 bar, as the injection\nsometimes occurs during the compression stroke when the cylinder pressure is\nconsiderably high. The schematic diagrams of both configurations are shown in\nFigure 1 with PFI on the left and DI on the right.\n\nFigure 1. Schematic diagrams of PFI configuration on the (left) and DI\nconfiguration on the (right). The star represents the spark and the arrows\nhighlight the locations where fuel injection occurs.\n\nSI operation is characterized by premixed combustion, where the homogeneous\nair\u2013fuel mixture is combusted by a propagating flame front, as depicted in\nFigure 1. The flame front can propagate at a very high speed if there is\nstrong turbulence present in the combustion chamber, which leads to a\ndesirable shorter combustion duration compared to compression-ignition (CI)\noperation. The homogeneous air\u2013fuel mixture also lowers the chance of soot\nformation in the combustion chamber of SI engines. Knock is the major\nconstraint for SI operation, which occurs when one or more pockets of unburned\nmixture autoignite outside of the envelope of the propagating flame front.\nUncontrolled autoignition may lead to detonation, and the associated shockwave\nmay severely damage the engine. Knock typically happens when the unburned\nmixture is exposed to high temperature and pressure for a residence time\nlonger than its ignition delay. Therefore, the boost level and compression\nratio (CR) for SI engines need to be limited to avoid knock. It is also common\nto apply a retarded spark timing when operating SI engines close to their peak\noutput.\n\nDI-SI engines are usually more knock-resistant than PFI-SI engines thanks to\nthe charge cooling effect resulting from fuel evaporation. In PFI-SI engines,\nthis evaporative cooling effect takes place in the intake path and the heat is\nabsorbed not only from the inlet air but also from metal components such as\nthe port wall and valves. For DI-SI engines, the evaporative cooling effect\ntakes place inside the cylinder and therefore, cools primarily the inlet air,\nwhich leads to a cooler unburned mixture. The temperature of the unburned\nmixture would further decrease if the residual gas fraction in the cylinder\ncould be minimized through over-scavenging, which is enabled by an overlap of\nthe inlet and exhaust valve open durations. This can only be implemented with\na DI configuration, as with PFI, over-scavenging would lead to a loss of\nunburned fuel [36]. With the higher knock limit of DI-SI engines, a higher CR\nand boost level can be adopted; hence, a higher power output can be expected.\nA cooler air\u2013fuel mixture also has a higher density, thus facilitating a\nhigher volumetric efficiency in DI-SI engines.\n\nAs shown in Table 1, methanol has a number of physicochemical properties that\nmake it particularly suitable for SI operation, including a higher burning\nvelocity, a higher autoignition temperature, and a higher HoV compared to a\ntypical SI fuel like gasoline. A higher flame speed implies that there is a\nhigher chance that the propagating flame front can \u201ccapture\u201d the pocket of hot\nunburned mixture before it reaches the autoignition temperature; a higher HoV\nhelps cool down the unburned mixture in general; and a higher autoignition\ntemperature means it takes longer for the unburned mixture to reach the\nautoignition temperature. With this superior knock-suppressing ability, SI\nengines on methanol can be operated at a higher CR or a more advanced spark\ntiming compared to gasoline and thus achieve better performance and\nefficiency.\n\nKoenig et al. [37] already verified the aforementioned benefits of introducing\nmethanol in SI engines in 1976, right after the world was shocked by the oil\ncrisis and was eagerly looking for an alternative to petroleum fuels. This\nprompted an on-road methanol-fueled fleet trial during the 1980s and 1990s in\nCalifornia [38,39]. The focus gradually shifted from energy security to air\nquality during the trial, where methanol also provides significant advantages\nover gasoline. Eventually, around 15,000 vehicles, ranging from passenger cars\nto buses and trucks, were involved in the trial. While this number was\nobviously not enough to demonstrate that methanol can replace gasoline,\nextensive and valuable experiences were gained, which greatly helped the later\ndevelopment of flex-fuel vehicles.\n\nMethanol\u2019s higher burning velocity and wider flammability limits also open up\nsome alternative options for load control in SI engines [40]. Pannone et al.\n[41] reported a substantial thermal efficiency improvement and a CO emission\nreduction with lean turbocharging compared to stoichiometric operation,\nalthough at the expense of lower combustion efficiency. Brusstar et al. [42]\nachieved a peak brake thermal efficiency (BTE) of nearly 43% when operating a\nturbocharged engine unthrottled with stoichiometric fueling and the load being\ncontrolled via exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). The test engine was a diesel\nengine and features a compression ratio (CR) as high as 19.5. Vancoillie et\nal. [43,44] experimentally verified the two operating strategies mentioned\nabove and confirmed that both the EGR dilution limit and lean burn limit of\nmethanol are significantly higher than that of gasoline. They then compared\nthe two operating strategies and concluded that unthrottled stoichiometric\noperation with load control via EGR is a more promising strategy since the\nrelatively cheap three-way-catalyst (TWC) technology can be utilized for EATS.\n\nUsing methanol in SI engines also faces its challenges. One of the notorious\nenemies is cold-starting, which is a well-known problem for engines on alcohol\nfuels owing to their relatively low vapor pressures and relatively high HoV.\nIn fact, one of the reasons that the fuel used during the California fleet\ntrial evolved from neat methanol to 85% methanol mixed with 15% gasoline (so-\ncalled M85 fuel) was to boost the vapor pressure to an extent that cold-\nstarting is possible again in most climates [38]. Over the years, many\nsolutions have been developed that do not involve adding a more volatile fuel.\nOne straightforward and widely adopted method is raising the fuel temperature\nbefore injection using heated injector tips [45,46,47]. Other methods include\nelectrically heating the engine block, intake manifold, and even the\nlubricating oil and coolant water [48]. DI configurations can also mitigate\nthis issue by creating charge stratification via late injection; consequently,\na richer mixture at the proximity of the spark plug can be formed and the\nignitability can be improved [17]. Next to cold-start, methanol SI engines\nalso exhibit different oscillation behavior when they knock. As recently\ndiscussed by Suijs et al. [49] and Robeyn et al. [50], the pressure\noscillation caused by knock in SI engines on methanol is very different from\nthose on gasoline. This necessitates extra attention and calibration for knock\ndetection algorithms in engine control software.\n\nNowadays, apart from some small model engines on radio-controlled vehicles and\nmotorsports engines on drag racers, SI engines on methanol are mostly found on\nthe road in China thanks to its nationwide policy to promote methanol usage.\nThis policy is primarily driven by the scarcity of oil resources in China,\nalthough it has abundant coal reserves, which can be used to produce methanol\n[51]. As of April 2022, the fleet consists of close to 30,000 methanol-powered\nvehicles, which covered a total mileage of nearly 10 billion kilometers [52].\nHowever, it is worth pointing out that the carbon footprint of producing\nmethanol from coal is significantly higher than the sustainable production\nroutes [53], which are discussed in Section 1.\n\nMost of the benefits of operating SI engines on methanol mentioned above were\nverified on light-duty (LD) automotive engines. HD engines, on the other hand,\nare characterized by a larger bore size and lower revving speed compared to LD\nengines. A larger bore size implies a longer distance for the flame front to\ntravel and the lower revving speed induces lower turbulence, hence, a slower\nflame speed. Both features render HD engines more susceptible to knock, which\nexplains why SI operation is very rare for HD applications. However, this also\nhighlights that methanol SI operation for HD applications is an interesting\nresearch topic, and promising results have been achieved with lab-scale\ndemonstration. The following subsections go through more details of the\ndemonstrators found in the literature, with Section 2.1 focusing on\ndemonstrators with the PFI configuration and Section 2.2 focusing on\ndemonstrators with the DI configuration.\n\n#### 2.1. Port-Fuel-Injection\n\nIt is relatively simple to convert an existing diesel engine to PFI-SI\nconfiguration, with additional methanol injectors installed on the intake\nmanifold and the diesel injectors replaced by spark plugs. A Scania D12 diesel\nengine featuring a 127 mm bore and a 154 mm stroke went through such\nconversion and was tested by Mahendar et al. [54]. Its knock-limited\nperformance was evaluated with increasing excess air ratios (\u03bb) at a fixed\nengine speed of 1200 revolutions per minute (rpm). The geometric CR of the\nengine was reduced to 13 through a customized piston. The peak indicated mean\neffective pressure (IMEP) achieved was 26.8 bar at \u03bb = 1.4 with an indicated\nthermal efficiency (ITE) of 46.8%. In fact, the engine was able to achieve a\nsimilar level of IMEP from stoichiometry up to \u03bb = 1.6 with retarded spark\ntiming for richer operation. Further diluted operation compromised the\ncombustion stability and resulted in unacceptably high HC emission. However,\nthere was also a clear trend showing that increased dilution led to improved\nITE and substantially dropped NO_x and CO emissions, hinting that lean burn\noperation with \u03bb between 1.4 to 1.6 may be optimal among the trade-offs.\n\nA similar conversion was performed on two diesel engines by G\u00fcdden et al.\n[55]. The smaller engine featured a cylinder displacement of roughly 2.1 L and\nthe CR of the engine was reduced to 11.5 [56]. At 900 rpm with wide-open\nthrottle (WOT) and stochiometric mixture, an EGR fraction of 16% was chosen\nfor a realistic boost pressure demand. Under this operating condition, the\nengine attained a peak IMEP of 14 bar at an ITE of 41% with minimum spark\nadvance for best torque (MBT) before reaching the knock limit. The maximum\nattainable IMEP could be extended to 20 bar when the spark timing was\nretarded, but the ITE also dropped to 39%. It is worth noting that the maximum\nIMEP was not limited by knock but an intolerably high exhaust gas temperature\ndue to the retarded spark timing. The larger engine had a displacement of\nroughly 5 L per cylinder (L/cyl) [57]. The modified piston reduced the\ngeometric CR to 14.5 and a Miller valve timing reduced the effective CR to\naround 13.8. The tests were performed with a fixed engine speed of 1800 rpm.\nThe load sweep was carried out at \u03bb = 1.7 and the highest IMEP achieved was\naround 17 bar with an ITE close to 47%. NO_x emissions at this peak operating\npoint were around 1 g/kWh, HC was around 2.5 g/kWh, and CO was around 4.5\ng/kWh. Similar to what Mahendar et al. [54] reported, a retarded spark timing\nwas required to achieve the peak IMEP and the combustion stability was\nseverely compromised when \u03bb approached 1.8.\n\nAs highlighted by G\u00fcdden et al. [57], large-bore SI engines on methanol\nexhibit great potential to outperform the most common large-bore SI engines on\nthe market currently, i.e., natural gas (NG) engines. This was confirmed by\nZhu et al. [58], who reported the test results of an HD NG engine that was\nmodified to facilitate PFI-SI operation on methanol. The engine featured a\nbore of 123 mm, a stroke of 154 mm, and a CR of 11.5 and was operated\nstoichiometrically with EGR dilution. It managed to attain a brake mean\neffective pressure (BMEP) of 21.7 bar with a brake thermal efficiency (BTE) of\nover 40%, which was more than 2 percentage points higher than that of the\noriginal NG engine. This peak output could be sustained for engine speeds\nranging from 1000 rpm to 1700 rpm, with corresponding EGR fractions from 19.4%\nto 23.2%. The reported NO_x emissions within this speed range were between 0.3\nand 0.8 g/kWh, HC emission between 1.0 and 2.1 g/kWh, and CO emission between\n6.8 and 8.6 g/kWh. Further research indicated that the injection timing\nexhibited a significant effect on mixture formation, which could either be\noptimized for regulated emissions such as HC and CO [59] or unregulated\nemissions, such as unburned methanol and formaldehyde [60], but proved\ndifficult for both. It was also found that unburned methanol emissions\ndecreased with lower EGR fraction; the trend was not monotonic for\nformaldehyde emissions, though.\n\nLaiminger et al. [61] tested a Jenbacher Type 6 gas engine from INNIO that was\nconverted to operate on methanol by adding a methanol injector in the intake\npath. This engine has a displacement of roughly 6 L/cyl, which is by far the\nlargest in the literature. Promising ITEs of 40% to 44% were attained at 1500\nrpm across various engine loads. Nonetheless, due to unsuitable automotive\ninjectors adopted, the amount of methanol that could be injected was limited;\nhence, the operating window was narrow. It was reported that the ignition\ndelay time in this engine was much longer than its NG counterpart, and it\ndecreased with a richer mixture or later spark timing, while the burn duration\nalso decreased with a richer mixture but increased with later spark timing. In\naddition, a high cyclic variability was observed.\n\nDespite the positive results from the demonstrators mentioned above, their\ndisplacement between 2 and 6 L/cyl only covers a fraction of HD engines. For\neven larger medium-speed engines, only simulation results are available in the\nliterature. Based on the combustion profiles presented in the publications of\nboth Mahendar et al. [54] and G\u00fcdden et al. [57], Pu et al. [62] extrapolated\nmethanol PFI-SI operation to a medium-speed ABC DZ engine that featured a\ndisplacement close to 16 L/cyl and a CR of 12. The engine speed in the\nsimulation was set to 1000 rpm, the rated speed of the engine, and a maximum\nboost of 2.5 bar (absolute) was applied. The knock limit was evaluated with a\nneural-network-based model developed by Suijs et al. [63]. It was found that,\nif the crank angle degree (CAD) where 50% of the fuel is burned (CA50) was\nkept at 15 CAD after top dead center (TDC) and the mixture temperature at the\nintake port was kept at well below 20 \u00b0C, knock-free operation was feasible\nwith an IMEP of 22.5 bar, an ITE of 42.8%, and NO_x emissions of 2.8 g/kWh.\n\n#### 2.2. Direct-Injection\n\nThe diesel engine with cylinder displacement of roughly 2.1 L that was\nconverted to PFI operation on methanol by G\u00fcdden et al. [56] mentioned in\nSection 2.1 was also tested with DI operation. The CR of the engine was\nidentical for both configurations, and the engine was also tested\nstoichiometrically with WOT at 900 rpm. With a similar boost level as the PFI\noperation, the EGR fraction reached 28% with the DI operation. The knock limit\nwas reached at an IMEP of 24 bar using MBT spark timing, which is a\nsubstantial increase from 14 bar with PFI operation. Similar to PFI, the\nmaximum attainable IMEP could be extended to 29 bar with retarded spark timing\nbefore reaching the exhaust gas temperature limit, and the peak ITE attained\nwas above 43%. Compared to the peak IMEP of 20 bar achieved at 39% ITE with\nthe PFI configuration, the DI configuration clearly exhibited its superiority\nin terms of power density and efficiency thanks to its elevated knock limit.\n\nInstead of demonstrating the advantage of a DI configuration with\ndemonstrators featuring a larger bore size, an engine with similar size but\nmuch higher CR was tested by Li et al. [64]. This single-cylinder research\nengine featured a CR of 17.3 and was converted to DI-SI operation on methanol\nfrom a Scania D13 diesel engine with a bore of 130 mm and a stroke of 160 mm.\nA high-pressure common rail injection system was installed on the engine. The\ntests were performed at a fixed IMEP of 8 bar and a fixed engine speed of 1200\nrpm with different start-of-injection (SOI) timing. The engine operated with a\n\u03bb of 1.5, and the spark timing was retarded to around TDC to avoid an\nexcessively high pressure rise rate beyond the hardware tolerance. The peak\nITE achieved was around 48% with an injection pressure of 2000 bar, a spark\ntiming of 2 CAD before TDC (bTDC), and an SOI at 27 CAD bTDC. The reported\nNO_x emissions were between 8 and 10 g/kWh with an injection pressure of 1000\nbar and a spark timing of 4 CAD bTDC. These measurement results were then used\nto validate a multi-dimensional simulation model for an in-depth study with\nparameter sweeps. The study showed that advancing SOI can improve both ITE and\nNO_x emissions, while advancing the spark timing benefits ITE at the expense\nof slightly worsened NO_x emissions.\n\nCompared to the PFI configuration, there are much fewer lab-scale DI\ndemonstrators in the literature. This is likely due to the difficulty of\nretrofitting existing diesel engines to this configuration, as both the\ninjector and spark plug need to be installed in the cylinder, so re-tooling is\nneeded for the cylinder head. However, DI-SI HD engines on methanol have\nactually shown a proven record in the real world. Back in 1982, Ullman et al.\n[65] reported the test results from a naturally aspirated MAN D2566 diesel\nengine converted to facilitate DI-SI operation on methanol. This six-cylinder\nengine featured a bore of 125 mm, a stroke of 155 mm, and a CR of 18. It had a\nrated output of 147 kW at 2200 rpm with a methanol fuel flow of 77 kg per\nhour, which corresponds to a BMEP of 7 bar and a BTE of 34.3%. Regulated and\nunregulated emissions were measured on a testbed with a TWC coupled to the\nengine during both steady-state and transient operations following the Federal\nTest Procedure (FTP). The measured CO and HC emissions were well below 1\ng/kWh, and NO_x emissions were at the level of 9 g/kWh for both transient and\nsteady-state cycles. The unburned alcohol almost doubled during the transient\ncycle and reached 0.91 g/kWh compared to steady-state, while aldehydes showed\na completely different trend, reaching 0.06 g/kWh during steady-state and\nnegligible during transient cycles. The same engine was later mounted on a bus\nfor revenue transit service as part of the California fleet trial mentioned\nearlier and accumulated an extensive mileage of 45,500 km. The emissions from\nthis methanol-powered bus were then evaluated again on the chassis dynamometer\nby Ullman et al. [66] for a comparison to diesel-powered buses. They concluded\nthat the regulated emission levels from the methanol-powered bus were\nsignificantly lower than those obtained from the diesel ones, while aldehyde\nemission was on par with the diesel ones.\n\nIn 2023, Duan et al. [67] reported the test results of a commercially\navailable HD truck in China, also equipped with a methanol DI-SI engine and a\nTWC, on the world harmonized transient cycle (WHTC) on a chassis dynamometer.\nThe engine featured a bore of 130 mm, a stroke of 160 mm, and a CR of 12.5.\nThe weighted results combining the cold-start and hot-start tests are\nsummarized in Table 2. It can be seen that they are all well within the limits\nof the China VI emission standards, which are aligned with the Euro VI\nemission standards. The transient emission measurement from Ullman is also\nincluded in Table 2 to showcase the technical advancement across more than\nfour decades.\n\nTable 2. Exhaust emissions of heavy-duty vehicles powered by DI-SI engines on\nmethanol under transient operation.\n\n#### 2.3. Discussion\n\nFrom the demonstrators in the lab and on the road mentioned in the previous\nsubsections, it can be concluded that SI engines on methanol for HD\napplications have already achieved a fairly high technology readiness level\n(TRL). Table 3 summarizes the pros and cons of the two different concepts\npresented along with their TRL. But still, how do they compare to the existing\ndiesel engines or even DF engines on the market? The comprehensive emission\nand performance comparison conducted by G\u00fcdden et al. [55,56] between the two\nretrofitted SI engines reported in the previous subsections and the two\nretrofitted DF engines on methanol/diesel of similar sizes may provide some\ninsights into this question. It was shown that for the size range around 2\nL/cyl, the DF engine, which features a CR of 18, equal to the baseline diesel,\nstill possesses a clear edge in terms of thermal efficiency. The SI engines,\non the other hand, feature a CR of merely 11.5, so their inferiority in\nefficiency is unsurprising. If a higher CR could be utilized, a similar\nefficiency level as the baseline diesel engine is potentially obtainable. As\nfor the size range around 5 L/cyl, the PFI-SI engine achieved slightly higher\nefficiency and considerably lower NO_x emissions than its DF counterpart from\nmedium load to high load, whereas its CO and HC emissions were higher and its\nmaximum attainable IMEP was lower.\n\nTable 3. Summary table of the SI concepts presented in Section 2.\n\nThese test results nicely summarize the strengths and weaknesses of methanol\nSI engines compared to the current diesel and DF engines on the market. In\ngeneral, on-par efficiency with diesel engines can be anticipated with further\ndesign optimization for methanol combustion, as most of the demonstrators are\nretrofitted from existing diesel or gas engines. Much lower NO_x emissions can\nalso be expected, which may spare the need for a costly selective catalytic\nreduction (SCR) unit in the EATS. However, the premixed nature of SI engines\nrenders higher HC and CO emissions inevitable, which likely necessitates an\noxidation catalyst. Torque delivery is another area that SI engines may\nstruggle with due to their susceptibility to knock. At high engine speeds,\nthis problem leads directly to a lower power density, while at lower engine\nspeeds, this problem translates to inferior drivability (or time-to-torque).\nDespite that, no issues were reported when the two methanol-powered HD\nvehicles listed in Table 2 were tested with transient and dynamic maneuvers.\nSince they are both equipped with DI-SI engines, torque delivery may be less\nof an issue for them thanks to the higher knock resistance. As for PFI-SI\nengines, they are better suited to applications with less transient and\ndynamic demand, such as stationary gensets or marine auxiliary engines.\n\nGiven the excellent results achieved by the 5 L/cyl PFI-SI engine, DI-SI\nengines with similar bore size can potentially outperform the existing diesel\nengines in terms of both efficiency and power output. However, there is no\ndemonstrator of this kind that can be found from either industry or the\nliterature. This can possibly be attributed to the difficulty of retrofitting\nexisting diesel engines to this configuration, as both the injector and spark\nplug need to be installed in-cylinder, so re-tooling is needed for the\ncylinder head. There is also a lack of development for appropriate methanol DI\ninjectors that can deliver the required flow rate for this size range. Another\nunknown is whether methanol SI operation is feasible for medium-speed engines\nwith cylinder sizes more than 10 L. The simulation shows positive results\n[62], but whether knock will be an issue is yet to be proven in the real\nworld. As already pointed out by Suijs et al. [68], the threshold of the\nmetrics that quantify the knock intensity can be very different for medium-\nspeed engines.\n\n## 3\\. Compression-Ignition\n\nMethanol, with its distinct fuel characteristics, finds optimal use in SI\nengines; however, the majority of heavy transport vehicles use conventional CI\ndiesel engines. As industries increasingly seek renewable and sustainable\ntransport alternatives, retrofitting existing CI engines to run on methanol\nbecomes an appealing option over engine replacements. This approach aims to\nreuse most current engine components in the retrofitting process.\nNevertheless, the widespread adoption of methanol faces obstacles.\n\nChallenges arise from methanol\u2019s high heat of vaporization, coupled with a low\ncetane number and higher fuel injection volumes, which introduces a major\ncooling effect at injection particularly affecting low-load and cold-start\ncompression-ignition [69]. Research has mainly focused on addressing these\nignition difficulties, resulting in several proposed solutions. As mentioned\nearlier, one common approach involves the dual-fuel setup, injecting diesel\nfuel to create the heat/flame needed to start the combustion of methanol\n[28,35,70,71]. This serves as an intermediate technology during the\ntransition; however, it does not eliminate fossil diesel fuel usage and\nrequires the implementation of a dual-fuel system. The associated complexities\nand costs make retrofitting current single-fuel systems a challenging step in\neliminating fossil diesel fuel from engine operations. Keeping the single-fuel\nsolution is much more enticing, and when it comes to intermediate technology\nsolutions with methanol, blending it with biodiesel fuel is an alternative.\nThis capitalizes on their miscibility without the need for a co-solvent or\nemulsifier, unlike the non-miscible nature of methanol and fossil diesel fuel.\nThis strategy addresses challenges such as high heat of vaporization and\nlubricity issues that come with methanol, although the MEFs that have been\ntested are on the lower side. The results have shown that an increasing\nproportion of methanol led to a reduction in NO_x emissions while concurrently\nincreasing CO and HC emissions [72]. This, although it is a single-fuel\nsolution, still has issues, as it involves a blending process, it needs access\nto enough biodiesel fuel, and it does not utilize the full potential of\nmethanol in CI engines. In the following sections, we review different single-\nfuel solutions utilizing CI of methanol fuel, see Figure 2, without a major\nblending process.\n\nFigure 2. Schematic diagrams of DICI configuration.\n\n#### 3.1. Ignition Improver\n\nInstead of blending methanol with diesel, an alternative approach involves\nadding an ignition improver to the methanol fuel. The primary function of an\nignition improver when mixed with methanol is to enhance the ignition\nproperties, particularly by increasing the cetane number compared to pure\nmethanol. This enhancement promotes ignition through compression alone,\nremoving the need for an additional fuel source. However, it is essential to\nacknowledge that ignition improvers can be relatively costly compared to\nmethanol. Hence, minimizing the ignition improver content is crucial to ensure\nit remains a viable and cost-effective option.\n\nThe use of ignition improver has been proven to work In real-world\napplications through the GreenPilot [73] and FASTWATER [74] projects. In the\nGreenPilot project, a blend comprising 95% methanol and 5% ignition improver\nwas tested in a Scania ED95 engine, originally designed for a blend of 95%\nethanol with 5% ignition improver. It showed stable combustion and even\nreliable start-up [73]. Subsequently, the European Horizon 2020 project\nFASTWATER further validated this approach by successfully converting a diesel-\nfueled CI engine to methanol operation, incorporating 3% ignition improver\n(MD97) [75]. This converted engine, based on the Scania ED95 engine with\nslight modifications such as an increased compression ratio and an in-house\ndesigned engine control unit (ECU), attained certification to the NO_x\nTechnical Code 2008 with IMO Tier III standards, all without requiring an\nEATS. Its installation and running on the Pilot 120 SE boat off the east coast\nof Sweden showcases the high TRL of methanol with ignition improvers [25].\n\nIn exploring ignition improver additives, various additives have undergone\ntesting and investigation. Aakko-Saksa et al. [76] conducted a study of\nmethanol blended with several types of ignition improver and lubricity\nadditives tailored for diesel engine application. Their research demonstrated\nthat MD95 fuel blends exhibited clean-burning characteristics, emitting fewer\ngaseous emissions than ED95, particularly when utilizing a glycerol ethoxylate\nadditive as an ignition improver. Moreover, the PM and PN emissions\noriginating from the additives in the tested fuels could be mitigated with the\nutilization of an oxidation catalyst. The study also explored the feasibility\nof reducing additive dosing in MD95 fuels, which was found to be feasible with\nthe aid of fuel injection into the intake manifold. Overall, the authors\nconcluded that their results showcased the MD95 concept as a promising\nsolution for smaller vessels equipped with 800\u20131200 kW engines.\n\nSimilarly, Cordtz et al. [77] investigated methanol blended with a\npolyethylene glycol ignition improver in a significantly smaller engine with a\nswept volume of 0.96 L, employing a standard diesel setup with an CR of 18.\nTheir findings revealed that utilizing a 5% ignition improver was sufficient\nto achieve stable premixed combustion with a 45 CAD bTDC injection timing,\nwithout the need for intake air heating. However, this setup was found to be\nsensitive to changes in \u03bb and temperature. When employing a classic diesel\ninjection timing of 10 CAD bTDC, the intake air temperature exceeded 100 \u00b0C\nbefore stable combustion was achieved. In contrast to the larger engines\ntested and developed, the experiment of Cordtz et al. featured a significantly\nlower CR of 18. This observation suggests that the installation of a higher\ncompression ratio, if possible, can reduce the required amount of ignition\nimprover needed for stable combustion.\n\nSamson et al. [78] conducted experiments on a similar engine to Cordtz\u2019s,\nemploying a single-cylinder engine with a displacement of 0.499 L and a CR of\n17.5. They investigated varying amounts of an enhancer containing alkyl\nnitrate (CEN), ranging from 0 to 5%. Similar to the findings of Cordtz et al.,\nSamson et al. concluded that a 5% ignition improver is necessary to lower the\nrequired intake temperature and achieve stable combustion. Regarding\nemissions, higher concentrations of CEN resulted in reduced CO and HC\nemissions due to enhanced combustion completeness. However, there was an\nincrease in NO_x emissions, attributed to the presence of nitrate in CEN.\nThese findings demonstrate that methanol with an ignition improver is viable\nfor smaller engines as well. Furthermore, they observed that increasing\nconcentrations of CEN altered the combustion process from solely premixed,\ncharacterized by a long ignition delay and short combustion duration, to a\ncombination of premixed and diffusion combustion, characterized by a shorter\nignition delay and longer combustion duration. Cheng et al. [79] observed the\nsame phenomena on a larger five-cylinder 9.4 L engine when testing different\namounts of ignition improver and varied ignition timing. Their results showed\nthat when varying the injection timing with 5% ignition improver, the\ncombustion characteristics were more similar to that of partially premixed\ncombustion (PPC), and the use of 3.5% ignition improver gave a pronounced\npremixed combustion process. Cheng et al. [80] expanded on this investigation\nthrough experimental and multi-packet-mode simulation studies. Their findings\nrevealed an ignition delay ranging from 14.1 to 22.8 CAD and an efficiency in\nthe range of 35 to 43%. Furthermore, the simulation study demonstrated that\nthe chemical ignition delays consistently exceeded the physical one,\nunderscoring the importance of prioritizing the chemical ignition delay to\nenhance the ignition performance of methanol fuel.\n\nFurther simulation studies were performed by Chang et al. [81] using a\ndetailed investigation into the influence of 2-ethylhexyl nitrate (EHN) cetane\nimprover on methanol ignition through chemical kinetic analysis. For the\nsimulation study, CHEMKIN PRO was utilized with a proposed and verified\nreduced mechanism of methanol and EHN, comprising 61 species and 479\nreactions. Their study revealed a significant increase in efficiency upon the\naddition of EHN. Specifically, compared to pure methanol, the ignition delay\nof methanol with 3% EHN was reduced by 99.85% at 800 K and by 99.99% at 1400\nK. However, as the EHN ratio increased, the effect of EHN on shortening the\nignition delay did not exhibit a linear increase but instead demonstrated a\nslowing trend. The decomposition of EHN generated NO_2, which actively\nparticipated in reactions at low temperatures, resulting in methanol\ncombustion initiation at lower temperatures. This phenomenon partly explains\nhow EHN enhances the combustibility of methanol upon its addition.\n\nThe studies discussed demonstrate the viability of methanol with ignition\nimprover as a single-fuel solution for CI engines, with only some\nmodifications to existing engines. However, there is room for further research\nto enhance combustion, expand the operating area of engine sizes, and reduce\nthe amount of costly ignition improvers. What is missing from these studies is\na comparison of methanol with ignition improver to other fuels. While Aakko-\nSaksa et al. [76] compared it to ethanol with ignition improver, the question\nremains how methanol with ignition improver fares in comparison to diesel, the\nfuel it seeks to replace, as well as to neat methanol.\n\nSvensson et al. [82] addressed this gap by conducting a comprehensive\nevaluation of the MD97 fuel blend previously mentioned [75], and comparing it\nto diesel fuel and non-blended methanol (MD100). This investigation utilized a\nsingle-cylinder converted six-cylinder heavy-duty CI engine with a\ndisplacement of 2.124 L/cyl. along a propeller curve. Their results revealed\nthat MD97 closely matches diesel fuel in gross ITE across most load conditions\nand even surpasses it at higher loads. Only at the lowest load did MD97\nexhibit a slight decrease in efficiency, but it still maintained stable\ncombustion. Furthermore, the study highlighted the significant enhancement in\nmethanol\u2019s combustibility with the addition of a 3% ignition improver,\nparticularly evident at lower loads. Noteworthy findings also include the\nsubstantial reduction in NO_x emissions with methanol usage, accompanied by\nminimal soot emissions, but with an increase in unburnt HC emissions.\n\nA study by Liu et al. [83] explored various concentrations of ignition\nimprover, 0.1%, 1%, and 3% of 2-ethylhexyl nitrate (EHN), and compared this\nagainst pure methanol and diesel. Their investigation focused on examining the\neffects on combustion and emissions under operating conditions of 2.2 bar BMEP\nand 1200 rpm engine speed, a lower-load case compared to Svensson et al. [82].\nThe results revealed that the lowest possible intake temperatures for stable\noperation with 0%, 0.1%, 1%, and 3% EHN were 100 \u00b0C, 100 \u00b0C, 80 \u00b0C, and 40 \u00b0C,\nrespectively, highlighting the impact of ignition improver addition on low-\nload methanol combustion. Additionally, it was observed that at an intake\ntemperature of 120 \u00b0C, 3% EHN exhibited a combustion phasing similar to diesel\nat 50 \u00b0C. Interestingly, the efficiency of pure methanol at 120 \u00b0C was\nrelatively higher than that of diesel, with the efficiency decreasing\ninitially upon the addition of EHN and then increasing with higher EHN\nconcentrations. This was likely due to the longer ignition delay from neat\nmethanol creating a more premixed in-cylinder condition resulting in faster\ncombustion.\n\nUtilizing ignition improver blended with methanol demonstrates significant\npromise as a single-fuel solution to replace diesel in compression-ignition\nengines. Research and development efforts have demonstrated the potential in\nboth smaller car engine sizes and heavy-duty engines, highlighting its\npotential across various vehicle types. However, as highlighted earlier,\nignition improver is costlier than methanol and necessitates an additional\nblending stage in the fuel production line. Therefore, it remains interesting\nto explore neat-methanol engine solutions as an alternative avenue,\nconsidering their potential advantages in addressing the cost and production\ncomplexities associated with ignition improver blends.\n\n#### 3.2. Glow Plug\n\nOne of the explored solutions involving neat methanol is the use of a glow\nplug to generate a hot spot in proximity to the fuel injection jet,\nfacilitating ignition and subsequent combustion propagation throughout the\ncombustion chamber. This approach gained significant interest during the\n1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, driven by U.S. concerns regarding petroleum imports,\nleading to numerous research projects and developments focusing on neat\nmethanol compression-ignition employing glow plugs. In 1983, Toepel et al.\n[84] converted a 9 L, six-cylinder Detroit Diesel Allison 6V-92TA two-stroke\ncoach engine to operate on methanol. This conversion was achieved by\ncontrolling the scavenging process to attain the desired in-cylinder\nconditions during fuel injection, complemented by the use of a glow plug\nduring start-up and light-load operation. The resulting engine, operating on\nmethanol, exhibited a thermal efficiency equal to or better than its diesel\ncounterpart, showcasing the feasibility of glow plugs in two-stroke engines.\n\nIn 1986, Kroeger et al. [85] at Caterpillar presented a study of a four-stroke\ndiesel in-line six-cylinder 10.5 L engine converted to methanol use utilizing\na glow plug, showing that four-stroke engines are also feasible. Their\nfindings demonstrated that methanol with a glow plug performs at comparable\nefficiency to diesel. Additionally, their study revealed a 50% reduction in\nNO_x emissions, negligible soot levels, and slightly higher HC emissions\ncompared to when using diesel fuel.\n\nIn 1980, Nagalingam et al. [86] showed that smaller engines can also be\nconverted by converting a four-stroke single-cylinder 0.553 L diesel engine to\noperate on alcohols and gasoline, employing a heated and insulated surface\nignition source. Their findings indicated that, at equivalent speeds, the\nengine exhibited optimal performance with the highest efficiency when running\non methanol, followed by ethanol, with a performance comparable to diesel\noperation.\n\nLater, in 1994, Goetz et al. [87] conducted an investigation into how the\ndesign of piston shape, injector design, combustion chamber swirl, and\ninjection timing affect emissions from a CI engine on methanol with a glow\nplug to obtain a deeper understanding of methanol glow plug engine design.\nTheir study utilized both a single-cylinder test engine and a heavy-duty six-\ncylinder engine. The results from the single-cylinder test highlighted a\nsignificant influence of the interaction between injector sprays with the\npiston bowl and the glow plug on engine emissions, emphasizing the importance\nof considering these factors in the design of a methanol glow plug engine.\nSpecifically, swirl was found to reduce HC emissions while increasing NO_x\nemissions, whereas fuel impingement on the piston resulted in lowered NO_x\nemissions. In the case of the multi-cylinder engine, the need for a glow plug\ndecreased as the engine heated up, and once fully warmed up, the engine could\noperate at all speeds and loads without the need for the glow plug. This shows\nthat the real need for ignition assistants is at start-up and cold-engine\nconditions.\n\nGreen et al. [88] conducted a comparative study between glow plug ignition of\nmethanol and the utilization of dimethyl ether (DME) in the intake for\nignition of DI methanol. The use of DME is a dual-fuel concept that relies on\nthe early combustion of DME, which heats the air in the cylinder prior to\nmethanol injection, creating favorable conditions for methanol compression-\nignition. This is intriguing because DME can be synthesized from methanol,\nmaking the refueling process only require one fuel. At the lowest tested load\nand speed, DME accounted for a substantial 59% of the injected fuel mass, but\nat higher loads and speeds, this proportion dropped to almost zero, indicating\nmethanol\u2019s ability to ignite under hotter engine conditions independently, but\nalso its need for aid at colder conditions. The resulting emission\nmeasurements indicated reduced CO and NO_x emissions when using glow plug\nignition compared to DME, but HC emissions were significantly increased. This\nstudy suggested that glow plug ignition may not be the optimal ignition\nassistance method for methanol, but further research is needed.\n\nIn 2001, Mueller and Musculus [89] conducted optical studies on a heavy-duty\nDI diesel engine fueled with methanol and assisted by glow plug ignition\noperating at 1200 rpm under moderate-load conditions. Their investigation\nrevealed a distinct three-step heat release pattern from the ignition of the\nglow plug. This phenomenon was attributed to the placement of the glow plug\nbetween two of the six injection jets emitted by the six-hole injector. As a\nresult, combustion initiation occurred sequentially at the two nearest jets to\nthe glow plug, followed by the next two, and finally the last two, shown as\nthe observed three-step heat release. Later, Krishnan et al. [90], through\ncomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, confirmed this by\ndemonstrating that the sprays ignite sequentially starting from the jet\nclosest to the glow plug, which thereby extends the combustion duration. This\nprolonged combustion can lead to significantly lower peak heat release rates,\nresulting in a notably quieter engine operation.\n\nAfter a period of limited research following extensive development of glow\nplug-assisted ignition in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, recent interest in\nmethanol has spurred new research and development efforts. Garcia et al.\n[91,92] conducted a comprehensive evaluation of methanol in a 1.6 L four-\ncylinder CI diesel engine, converting it to methanol operation through\nincreased compression ratio, intake heating, and glow plug assistance for low-\nload ignition stability. Their experiments revealed that methanol performs\nsimilarly to diesel in terms of efficiency at medium to high loads when the\nengine is warm. However, methanol exhibits poorer combustion stability at low\nloads, attributed by the authors to the high ignition energy requirements and\nlong ignition delay of methanol. The heating accessories used were\ninsufficient for low-load operations, prompting the authors to recommend\nhigher compression ratios and/or spark plug assistance, and although at high\nload they were not necessary, they were found to enhance stability when\nutilized.\n\n#### 3.3. Increased in-Cylinder Temperature\n\nNumerous researchers have employed intake air heating as a method to assist in\nCI of neat methanol. However, this approach faces limitations in real-world\napplications due to the requirement for additional heaters and the electrical\npower needed to operate them. Instead, alternative engine parameters can be\nmanipulated to raise the in-cylinder temperature effectively.\n\n#### 3.3.1. EGR\n\nUsing exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) with methanol CI combustion is an\nenticing concept, as it exploits the absence of significant soot levels in\nmethanol emissions to circumvent the NO_x\u2013soot trade-off typically associated\nwith conventional fuels, and it is also possible to use hot EGR to avoid using\nan intake heater to increase the in-cylinder temperature.\n\nGarcia et al. [91,92] also investigated the use of EGR, observing a reduction\nin NO_x emissions across all loads with more EGR, accompanied by increased CO\nemissions at all loads and elevated HC emissions at low loads but reduced at\nmedium loads. Furthermore, their estimations based on the Worldwide Harmonized\nLight Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP) cycles demonstrated an almost 50%\ndecrease in NO_x emissions with EGR utilization for the cycle.\n\nGainey et al. [93] conducted experiments with methanol CI utilizing EGR on a\n0.423 L single-cylinder research engine at medium to high loads, employing a\nstandard diesel CR of 16. Their findings indicated a decrease in engine-out\nNO_x emissions with increasing EGR, accompanied by an elongation of the heat\nrelease and a slight reduction in efficiency. Notably, the dilution with EGR\nled to continued oxidation of CO late into the expansion stroke, resulting in\na non-zero heat release that became longer with higher EGR levels. However, as\nthe equivalence ratio approached stoichiometry, insufficient time for complete\nCO oxidation led to a significant increase in emissions with a corresponding\ndecline in efficiency, although NO_x emissions were reduced substantially. It\nis worth noting that the lower compression ratio necessitated significant\nintake heating, which may impact EGR limitations and equivalence ratio due to\nthe reduced oxygen density in hotter air.\n\n#### 3.3.2. Compression Ratio\n\nThe concept of employing higher compression ratios in CI engines running on\nmethanol has been explored by several researchers, as demonstrated in the\npreviously described engines utilizing methanol with an ignition improver\n[82]. The objective behind this approach is to elevate the in-cylinder\ntemperature to aid in facilitating the ignition of methanol. While such a\npractice is not typical for diesel engines due to concerns about emissions,\nparticularly NO_x formation at higher temperatures, this is less of an issue\nwith methanol due to its cooling effect from injection, which mitigates NO_x\nproduction.\n\nSvensson et al. [94] demonstrated that elevating the CR from 17 to 40 in a\nheavy-duty engine can reduce the necessary intake temperature for stable\ncombustion by over 100 \u00b0C. However, such a high CR is impractical for real-\nworld applications, as it would lead to peak pressures exceeding the engine\u2019s\nmaximum allowable limits at high loads. Additionally, Svensson et al.\nillustrated that incorporating a small pilot injection prior to the main\ninjection could also decrease the required intake temperature.\n\nShamun et al. [95] implemented a more practical yet still elevated CR of 27 in\na Scania D13 engine modified to run on one cylinder. Their study investigated\nthe impact of injection pressure, EGR, \u03bb, and CA50 on efficiency and emissions\nduring methanol CI combustion at 6 bar IMEPg and 1200 rpm. With this CR,\nmethanol exhibited easy ignition at a 50 \u00b0C intake temperature, indicating\npromising prospects for methanol CI engine configurations. Among the tested\nparameters, higher fuel pressure was found to decrease efficiency due to more\nincomplete combustion, likely from higher levels of wall-wetting. A \u03bb between\n1.75 and 1.9 yielded the highest efficiency, while increasing EGR also\nenhanced efficiency. Moreover, elevated HC emissions were observed due to the\nhigher compression ratio and a greater fraction of squish area.\n\n#### 3.4. Advanced Injection Strategies\n\n#### 3.4.1. Pilot Injection\n\nThe cooling effect of injecting methanol has a great negative effect on the\ncombustibility of methanol, especially in cold and low-load conditions;\ntherefore, concepts that can counteract this effect are of great interest. One\npossibility is employing a pilot injection alongside a larger main injection\nto spread out the cooling effect induced by methanol injection while utilizing\nthe pilot as a means to preheat the combustion chamber, thereby facilitating\nthe ignition of the main injection. Gainey et al. [93] demonstrated that\nadvancing both the pilot and main injections could positively influence\nefficiency, provided that excessive fuel does not combust before TDC.\nAdditionally, they highlighted the significance of pilot size, emphasizing\nthat an insufficiently sized pilot might fail to adequately assist the main\ninjection in ignition. Conversely, an excessively large pilot injection\nnecessitated significant retardation of pilot timing to prevent engine damage\nresulting from premature heat release. Thus, optimizing the size and timing of\nthe pilot injection emerged as crucial factors in achieving effective main\ninjection ignition.\n\nSvensson et al. [96] delved deeper into the impact of the timing and duration\nof a single pilot injection, coupled with a diffusion-controlled main\ninjection, on the combustion behavior of neat methanol in a heavy-duty\ncompression-ignition engine with a 5 bar load. Their study revealed that\nincorporating a pilot injection significantly reduced the required intake\ntemperature for stable combustion compared to relying solely on a single main\ninjection, while also notably lowering NO_x emissions. They observed distinct\ncombustion characteristics, whereby a short injection length and dwell time\nbetween the pilot and main injections led to the pilot burn being integrated\ninto the main heat release, resulting in a characteristic \u201chump\u201d in the heat\nrelease profile. Conversely, longer injections and dwell times caused the\npilot to burn independently, yielding a two-stage heat release pattern.\nOptimal results were achieved with a dwell time of 15 to 20 CAD and a pilot to\nmain injection ratio ranging from 0.18 to 0.27, resulting in the lowest\nemissions and a 5-percentage-point increase in efficiency compared to a single\ninjection. Notably, the study utilized a compression ratio of 26:1 and intake\ntemperature of 61 \u00b0C, underscoring the significant impact of increased\ncompression ratio coupled with advanced injection strategies in enhancing low-\nload CI combustion of methanol.\n\n#### 3.4.2. Homogenous Charge Compression-Ignition\n\nFurther investigation into advanced injection strategies with neat methanol\ncombustion has been undertaken by several researchers. One approach, which\nstands in stark contrast to conventional diesel diffusion combustion, is\nhomogeneous charge compression-ignition (HCCI). HCCI relies on the creation of\na homogeneous air/fuel mixture by very early fuel injection ignited by\ncompression, a concept that poses challenges in controlling ignition timing,\nas it depends on meeting autoignition conditions. To address this, various\nmethods have been investigated, including adjusting the intake temperature,\nutilizing EGR, and varying the compression ratio and valve timing to influence\nthe in-cylinder conditions and thus, control ignition timing. The reason for\nusing HCCI combustion lies in its capacity to maintain flame temperatures\nbelow 1900 K, thereby minimizing or even eliminating NO_x emissions.\n\nMaurya and Agarwal [97] conducted a study of the performance, combustion, and\nemission characteristics of an HCCI engine fueled with ethanol and methanol,\ncomparing them with gasoline fuel. Their experiments utilized a modified four-\ncylinder four-stroke engine equipped with a port fuel injection system to\nachieve the homogeneous mixture. The findings revealed significantly low\nlevels of NO_x emissions; however, they also indicated elevated CO and HC\nemissions. Moreover, gasoline and ethanol exhibited a higher maximum\nefficiency compared to methanol.\n\nGharehghani [98] investigated the load limitations of methanol, ethanol, and\nnatural gas in HCCI operation using a comparable engine setup to that of\nMaurya and Agarwal. The results largely corroborated the previous findings.\nThey also indicated that methanol and ethanol perform better at low loads,\nwhile natural gas is more effective at high loads. Additionally, it was\nobserved that methanol exhibited the highest levels of NO_x emissions among\nthe tested fuels. These findings collectively suggest that the HCCI strategy\nmay not be the most suitable option for methanol in CI engines.\n\n#### 3.4.3. PPC\n\nAnother advanced injection strategy that has been more extensively researched\nis partially premixed combustion (PPC), which can be viewed as an intermediary\napproach between HCCI and diffusion combustion. PPC involves an early\ninjection, though not as early as HCCI, during the compression stroke,\nensuring that fuel and air are adequately (partially) premixed before\ncombustion to mitigate high temperatures and fuel concentrations, while not\nbeing \u201ctoo mixed\u201d to encounter the HCCI challenges mentioned above.\n\nKristersson [99] explored PPC with neat methanol and demonstrated its\nfeasibility. Employing a heavy-duty Scania engine with a CR of 15, the study\nutilized an injection timing of 23 CAD bTDC to facilitate methanol combustion\nunder PPC conditions. Notably, the intake temperature required for combustion\ninitiation at low loads was set at 150 \u00b0C, a value impractical for production\nengines. To address this limitation, the author suggests an increased\ncompression ratio as a potential solution. Building upon this research, Zincir\net al. [100] delved deeper into the effects of intake air temperature on low-\nload methanol combustion under PPC conditions, utilizing a slightly elevated\nCR of 20. Despite this adjustment, intake temperatures of 100 \u00b0C or higher\nwere still necessary, albeit enabling stable PPC operation under idle engine\nconditions, achieving a gross indicated efficiency of around 29%. At higher\nloads of 3 bar, the efficiency was 42\u201343%, which is in line with diesel CI.\nInterestingly, Zincir et al. found that splitting the injection into a pilot\nand main injection could lower the required intake temperature when running\nPPC, similar to earlier findings with diffusion-combustion-like injection\ntimings. A similar outcome was observed by L\u00f6nn [101], who investigated the\nimpact of single- and double-injection strategies on low-load methanol PPC\nusing an optical engine. Notably, a configuration with a first injection at 20\nCAD bTDC followed by a second one at 6 CAD bTDC could reduce the required\ninlet temperature by 58 \u00b0C compared to the worst-case single-injection\nstrategy. Aziz et al. [102] delved further into the design of injection timing\nfor methanol PPC and examined different multiple-injection strategies. The\nresults demonstrated that among the tested double-injection strategies, a\n50/50 split of the fuel in the pilot/main with a pilot injection timing of 40\nCAD and main timing of 30 CAD bTDC exhibited the best merit function. This\nconfiguration yielded low NO_x and HC emissions along with an indicated\nefficiency of 44.4%. Further benefits of using a double injection are the\nlowered maximum pressure rise rate, which, according to the simulation study\nby Pucilowski et al. [103], can be lowered by a factor of three.\n\nSvensson et al. [104] conducted a comprehensive investigation into the\npotential emissions of PPC methanol. They utilized a 0-D approach with\nconstant pressure, temperature, and equivalence ratio to construct T-\u03a6 maps\nshowing emission characteristics, complemented by a stochastic reactor model\n(SRM) for engine simulation with end-gas emission predictions. Analysis of the\nT-\u03a6 maps revealed non-existent soot, avoidable formaldehyde emissions, low\nmethane levels compared to diesel, and similar CO and NO_x emission levels to\ndiesel.\n\nTo further explore emissions, Shamun et al. [105] investigated PM emissions\nfrom a heavy-duty Scania engine utilizing PPC with methanol, ethanol, and\nnaphtha gasoline. They examined particle number, soot mass emissions, and\nparticle number size distributions. The results indicated that the alcohols\ndid not emit particles larger than 30 nm, with ethanol generally yielding\nsmaller sizes compared to methanol. Methanol also emitted a higher number of\nparticles overall. None of the tested alcohols exceeded the Euro VI PM or PN\nemission standards, unlike gasoline. However, current regulations for PN do\nnot consider solid particles with a diameter less than 23 nm.\n\nShamun et al. [106] extended this investigation by employing an electrostatic\nprecipitator (ESP) sample PM on copper grids for transmission electron\nmicroscopy (TEM) and utilizing energy-dispersive X-ray analysis. They also\nanalyzed new and used lubrication oil, along with methanol and diesel, to\nassess their sulfur and metal content. The findings revealed that particles\nemitted from methanol and ethanol combustion primarily originated from the\nlubrication oil, containing elements such as Ca, S, P, and Zn. In contrast,\ndiesel combustion produced a higher abundance of particles, with PM/soot\nemissions measured to be three to ten times higher than those from the\nalcohols. Although fewer nucleation-mode particles were present in diesel\nemissions, they also comprised the same four elements. This underscores the\nadvantages of utilizing alcohols in CI engines concerning PM and particle\nnumber emissions. However, efforts to mitigate nucleation-mode particles are\ncrucial and might be possible using a diesel oxidation catalyst.\n\n#### 3.5. Discussion\n\nSeveral different concepts utilizing CI methanol have been presented,\nsummarized in Table 4, and to conclude, methanol is viable but requires some\nform of aid to combust through compression. Using ignition improvers, which\nimprove the cetane number, has been shown to work in real-world operations\nwith good efficiency and emission results. However, it requires the addition\nof ignition improvers, which can be costly and add complexity with a fuel\nblending stage in production or refueling. Another option is the use of a glow\nplug, which has also been proven to work, especially in the 1970s, 1980s, and\n1990s with stable start-up. However, this requires cylinder head space to\naccommodate a glow plug and regular service to change the glow plug, and the\ncombustion characteristics of a glow plug can lead to suboptimal prolonged\nheat release.\n\nTable 4. Summary table of the CI concepts presented in Section 3.\n\nMany of the researchers cited here have instead opted to use an increased\nintake air temperature to create the conditions needed to compression-ignite\nneat methanol. This requires the addition of an electrical heater to the\nintake, which needs power and space and is therefore not very convenient to\nuse. Instead, other methods can be used to raise the in-cylinder temperature.\nHot EGR is one method, which can also lower NO_x emissions. Additionally,\nbecause methanol has negligible soot emissions, there is no NO_x\u2013soot trade-\noff to consider, which can extend the range of use for EGR. But this method\ndoes not aid at start-up when no exhaust gases are available and is therefore\nlimited in use. Another method is to increase the compression ratio, which\nincreases the cylinder temperature in all cases. This can also enhance the\nthermal efficiency, particularly when coupled with methanol\u2019s cooling effect\nduring injection, which helps mitigate NO_x emissions that would otherwise\npose a challenge. However, a notable drawback of this concept is the elevation\nof peak pressure in all cases, potentially restricting the engine\u2019s operating\nrange due to pressure limitation.\n\nAnother concept that also has a mostly positive impact is the use of advanced\ninjection strategies. It has been shown to lower the required intake heating,\nachieve good emission levels, and potentially lower the peak pressure. Among\nthe different injection strategies of pilot injection, PPC, and HCCI, HCCI\ndoes not seem to be a good option for methanol. It is hard to control, has\nelevated HC and CO emissions from more fuel in crevices, and is shown to be\nmore suited for gasoline and ethanol. Instead, PPC or classical diffusion\ncombustion with a pilot injection are more suitable alternatives for methanol\nCI. Both of these concepts have been tested, demonstrating good efficiencies\nand low emissions levels, while also reducing the requirement for high in-\ncylinder temperatures. However, it is important to note that both PPC and\ndiffusion combustion with pilot injection require careful optimization to\navoid the risk of excessive combustion before TDC, which could lead to engine\ndamage. Additionally, opening of the injector multiple times per cycle may\naccelerate injector wear, causing additional cost and service time.\n\nAs a final point, the further development of methanol should focus on\ncombining different concepts, as this could potentially make neat methanol\nwork for a large variety of engine sizes under most conditions and loads. A\ngood combination could potentially include increased CR, a glow plug (for\ncold-start and, if needed, the lowest loads), a multi-injection strategy (to\nspread out the cooling effect, add heat for the main injection, and lower peak\npressures), and EGR (to lower NO_x and use hot EGR for extra in-cylinder\ntemperature).\n\n## 4\\. Pre-Chamber\n\nHistorically, the concept of auxiliary combustion chambers or pre-chambers\n(PC) originates from the early 20th century, when Sir Harry Ricardo patented\nhis Ricardo Dolphin engine in the 1910s [107] using the Comet pre-chamber to\nenable fast air\u2013fuel mixing in small, high-speed diesel engines. In these\nengines, a separate combustion chamber, the pre-chamber, was connected to the\nmain combustion chamber (MC) via a nozzle, passageway, or one or more orifices\n[108]. In the early days of PC research, the focus was on systems featuring\nlarge volumes and large-diameter throats connecting the PC and MC. This\nenables continuous flame front propagation across the two chambers. The\ndownside is that the increased PC wall surface leads to increased heat\ntransfer losses and higher hydrocarbon emissions. Hence, these large PCs\ngradually disappeared in the past decades [107]. The remaining parts of this\nchapter will thus focus mainly on the smaller (2\u20135% of clearance volume) PC\nconcepts.\n\nThe concept of using an auxiliary chamber was later adopted by gasoline spark\nignition engines when reducing fuel consumption became a high priority [109].\nHere, the PC is typically a smaller volume that is connected to the MC through\na series of smaller orifices. During the compression stroke, the air\u2013fuel\nmixture from the MC is forced into the PC, where it is ignited by a spark\nplug. This causes the mixture in the PC to burn, resulting in a higher\npressure. The pressure buildup expels the burning mixture through the orifices\ninto the MC. The flames are quenched when passing through the narrow openings,\nwhich results in the formation of highly turbulent and reactive jets rather\nthan continuous flame propagation. The partially combusted reactants and\nproducts, a turbulent mixture of highly reactive chemical species with a high\nthermal energy, penetrate the main air\u2013fuel mixture and ignite it, acting as a\ndistributed ignition source [110]. This results in a substantial increase in\nthe combustion velocity, establishing a more concentrated heat release closer\nto the optimum, leading to a highly efficient combustion of the MC fuel while\nat the same time suppressing knock.\n\nThis jet ignition concept, depicted in Figure 3, was first introduced in the\nlate 1950s by Nikolai Semenov [109]. The intention was to use PC technology to\nestablish stable combustion while running very lean mixtures with a \u03bb of 2 or\nabove [107], as lean operation can increase efficiency and lower emissions.\nNO_x emissions have been reported to be reduced to single-digit ppm values\nwhile reducing specific fuel consumption [110]. This can be attributed to\nlowered in-cylinder temperatures, resulting in less heat loss. Additionally,\nthere are lower pumping losses due to a lesser need for throttling. Finally, a\nhigher oxygen content leads to a more complete combustion. PC combustion\nsystems are commonly used in large gas engines [111] and have been used since\n2015 by Formula-1 racing teams [112], highlighting the possibilities of this\ntechnology as an enabler of methanol as a fuel in HD engines.\n\nFigure 3. Schematic of the jet ignition concept with an actively fueled pre-\nchamber. The star represents the spark and the arrows highlight the locations\nwhere fuel injections occur.\n\nResearch on the use of PCs in combustion engines was reviewed and summarized\nby Toulson et al. [109], Alvarez et al. [112], and Zhu et al. [107]. A major\ncontribution to the foundation of small-volume PC research focusing on design\nparameters was made by Gussak et al. [113,114,115], who were among the early\nresearchers investigating PCs starting in the 1970s. They concluded that a PC\nwith a size of 2\u20133% of the clearance volume combined with an orifice total\narea of 0.03 to 0.04 cm2 per cm3 of PC volume is optimal for combustion\nstability, efficiency, and power. More recent work on the matter by Shah et\nal. [116], which studies the effect of PC volume and nozzle diameter in a\nsingle-cylinder engine, lies in line with Gussak\u2019s findings on geometrical\nparameters.\n\nWhen delving into PCs used in premixed combustion, two different layouts can\ntypically be discerned. The distinction is whether or not an auxiliary fuel\nsystem is used in the PC [107], which results in an active- or passive-fueled\nPC. In an active PC, a second injection enriches the PC mixture to have a\nricher mixture near the spark plug. With a passive PC, typically a cap with\norifices on the spark plug, fuel in the PC originates from the scavenged gases\nthat enter the PC during the compression stroke. A schematic of both systems\nis given in Figure 4. The use of an additional injection system in the PC has\nproven to be beneficial [112], as will be discussed later, yet increases\ncomplexity and, thus, the cost of the system.\n\nFigure 4. Schematic of the pre-chamber configurations, passive on the (left)\nand active on the (right).\n\nIn recent years, pre-chamber technology has gained interest as a means to\nfacilitate the use of renewable fuels in ICEs, next to improving combustion\nwith classic fossil fuels. Research has explored the feasibility of employing\npre-chambers with a variety of renewable fuels [110,117,118,119,120,121]. Many\nof these possess high octane numbers, rendering them challenging to ignite in\nCI engines. While SI engines are better-suited for these high-octane renewable\nfuels, their size and achievable power output are often constrained by knock,\nas explained earlier. This is where pre-chamber systems emerge as a solution\nto reduce knock and enhance combustion stability. A comprehensive review of\nthe use of different renewable fuels in conjunction with pre-chamber\ntechnology was conducted by Trombley et al. [122]. This review encompassed\npre-chamber systems aimed at optimizing combustion in both SI and CI engines,\nproviding insights into various fuels such as biodiesel, jet fuel, methanol,\nethanol, ammonia, syngas, LPG/propane, natural gas/methane, and hydrogen, with\ngasoline and diesel as reference fuels.\n\nAn in-depth analysis of the effects of fuel properties on PC combustion was\nconducted by Hlaing et al. [110]. Their study examined parameters such as the\nflammability limits, combustion stability, emissions, and attainable\nefficiencies of different renewable fuels. The findings underscored the\nsignificance of fuel properties, particularly flame speed, in shaping the MC\nheat release characteristics. It could be concluded that PCs facilitate\nstable, efficient, and low-emission combustion while utilizing alternative\nfuels [122].\n\nA final distinction between PC concepts can be made by categorizing them based\non premixed or non-premixed combustion in the MC. Premixed air\u2013fuel mixtures\nare inherently susceptible to knock, limiting the size and power output of\nsuch engines to a certain extent. Non-premixed concepts [123] offer a\npotential solution to this issue while providing additional benefits compared\nto premixed PC combustion. This concept was introduced by Kammel et al. [124],\nwho used a PC to enable the mixing-controlled combustion of methane in a\nlarge-bore gas engine. This concept was later adopted by Dempsey et. al. [125]\nfor liquid high-octane fuels as well. Nonetheless, it is essential to note\nthat each technology has its own set of benefits and drawbacks, which will be\nincluded in the comparison later in this review.\n\nMethanol, given its low adiabatic flame temperature, high cooling power, and\nfast flame speed (see Table 1), appears to be a logical fuel choice for\nemission reduction, as these properties are associated with efficient low-\ntemperature combustion and low emissions [122]. The increased burning rate\ncaused by the PC enhances the effects of using methanol, resulting in an even\nmore efficient combustion. Moreover, methanol exhibits the highest combustion\nstability and the widest operating range of global-\u03bb, with the lean limit in\nthe MC able to reach a global-\u03bb of up to 3.4 [110]. However, flame speeds\ndecrease in leaner mixtures, creating a trade-off.\n\nMethanol features a high octane number, mainly due to the combination of its\nhigh flame speed and cooling power [17]. This makes methanol suitable for use\nin larger engines than would be possible with gasoline by extending the knock\nlimit. These properties of methanol, combined with the knock-suppressing\nproperties of PC combustion, enhance the potential for both increased bore\nsize and higher power output. A disadvantage of PC combustion is the increased\nheat loss from the increased wall area. However, these losses are reduced by\nthe cooling effects of methanol, making methanol an ideal choice for PC\ncombustion, by eliminating one of its major downsides.\n\nHowever, alcohol fuels are also known to produce higher CO and HC emissions\n[110], which may necessitate the use of an oxidizing catalyst. Nonetheless,\nmethanol exhibits lower CO and HC emissions compared to ethanol [110].\nAdditionally, the high HoV of methanol will result in more attention required\nfor mixture preparation in the PC compared to gaseous fuels, due to poorer\natomization of the fuel as, being a liquid, it has to evaporate first [110].\nHowever, the same high HoV in combination with the low air-to-fuel ratio of\nmethanol results in high charge cooling [17]. Combined with lean, low-\ntemperature combustion, this leads to significantly reduced NO_x emissions. In\ngeneral, the non-sooting properties of methanol enable the exploration of new\nignition and combustion strategies that would not be allowable with\ntraditional sooting fossil fuels or that would involve inherent trade-offs.\nCombining the above, it can be concluded that methanol emerges as a very\nsuitable candidate for use as a renewable fuel in PC combustion engines.\n\nThe subsequent sections will delve into both premixed and non-premixed\ncombustion concepts in greater detail. Initially, the classic PC layouts,\nencompassing both passive (Section 4.1) and active (Section 4.2) PCs that\neject jets into a premixed air\u2013fuel mixture in the MC, will be explored.\nSubsequently, non-premixed concepts will be elaborated on (Section 4.3). Each\nsection will explain the general working principle and specify the advantages\nand disadvantages associated with each PC strategy.\n\n#### 4.1. Passive Pre-Chamber\n\nPassive PCs, while promoting combustion stability and reducing combustion\ndurations, do not exhibit a significant extension of the lean limit beyond\ntypical SI operation [126]. Nevertheless, they effectively enhance the heat\nrelease rate of near-stoichiometric MC charges [122], facilitating fast\ncombustion, resulting in a reduced probability of autoignition, and,\nconsequently enabling the use of higher compression ratios or increased bore\nsize, resulting in either higher efficiency or higher power output. This\nrenders passive PC technology an intriguing low-cost option for HD\napplications [107].\n\nHarrington et al. [126] compared passive PC layouts to traditional spark-\nignited combustion for both gasoline and methanol. They conducted tests on a\n0.5 L/cyl light-duty three-cylinder engine with a bore of 83 mm, a stroke of\n92.4 mm, and a CR of 16. The study revealed that transitioning from gasoline\nto methanol led to a 2\u20133 percent improvement in thermal efficiency, combined\nwith 3\u20134 times lower NO_x emissions. However, efficiency gains when using a\npassive PC were less pronounced compared to gasoline, as conventional spark\nignition of methanol in a smaller SI engine already results in significantly\nimproved efficiency. This is mainly due to the high octane number of methanol,\nas the absence of knock means that MBT spark timing could be used at all\nloads. A slight increase in achievable enleanment was observed with the use of\na passive PC, which resulted in a decrease in NO_x emissions. However, the\neffects on the lean limit are limited, as the PC and MC maintained similar \u03bb.\n\nA comparison between methanol and ethanol was performed by Burkardt et al.\n[117]. The experiments were conducted using a similar light-duty engine,\nspecifically a 0.5 L single-cylinder DI research engine with a bore of 75 mm,\na stroke of 113 mm, and a CR of 16.4 was used. The study found that methanol\nusage resulted in higher excess air ratios and higher ITE compared with\nethanol. The authors noted that PC combustion benefits from short burn\ndurations caused by multiple, distributed ignition sites. However, the\nadditional surface area corresponding to a PC leads to increased wall heat\nlosses, particularly evident at certain operating points. At lower \u03bb,\ntemperatures are higher, resulting in lower ITE than the SI counterparts as a\nconsequence of the thermal losses. It is worth mentioning that these results\nare specific to a light-duty engine, where heat losses are more pronounced\nthan in larger engines. However, there is a lack of available measurements on\nheavy-duty passive PC engines running on methanol to provide a comparative\nanalysis. Additionally, the study noted that NO_x emissions were more\ndependent on the achieved excess air ratio rather than the configuration of\nthe PC or the fuel itself. Unfortunately, enleanment is limited in a passive\nPC layout, as the PC has the same lean mixture as the MC, limiting the\npossibility to lower NO_x emissions.\n\n#### 4.2. Active Pre-Chamber\n\nSimilar to passive PCs, active PC concepts are found to increase combustion\nspeed and enhance combustion stability, leading to improved efficiency and\nless susceptibility to knock, as discussed previously. However, in contrast to\npassive layouts, active PCs are capable of substantially extending the lean\nlimit, exceeding a \u03bb of 2 [127,128]. These very lean mixtures hold promise for\nreducing both fuel consumption and NO_x emissions due to their low adiabatic\nflame temperatures. This holds true even with high rates of EGR; however,\nhighly diluted mixtures are known to pose challenges regarding ignitability\nand incomplete combustion. Fortunately, these can be addressed by the active\nPC [122]. Additional fuel supply to the PC is crucial for combustion stability\nand the lean limit extension [129]. As a result of employing an auxiliary fuel\ninjection in the PC, the performance of an active PC engine can rival that of\nCI engines [107].\n\nIn their research on PCs in light-duty engines, Burkardt et al. [117] and\nHarrington et al. [126] also investigated active layouts. Both concluded that\nactive PCs have a significantly extended lean limit compared to their passive\ncounterparts. This extension is attributed to the fuel enrichment of the PC,\nresulting in stable and strong jets capable of successfully igniting the much\nleaner MC mixture. Consequently, this leads to significantly lower NO_x\nemissions, as these emissions are strongly correlated with global \u03bb. Near-zero\nNO_x emissions of 0.07 g/kWh were measured at \u03bb = 2.2 utilizing methanol,\ncompared with NO_x emissions exceeding 10 g/kWh at \u03bb = 1 [117]. However, as \u03bb\nincreases, so do HC emissions, although, with PC combustion, the increase in\nHC emissions is less pronounced than in traditional SI operations due to the\nfaster combustion [117]. Nonetheless, there remains a trade-off between NO_x\nand HC emissions.\n\nOptical measurements and computational simulations conducted by Liu et al.\n[127] shed light on the potential of methanol PC combustion in heavy-duty\nengines. Their investigation focused on a Volvo engine (2.1 L/cyl, bore = 131\nmm) equipped with a PC, fueling both the PC and MC with methanol. Optical\nengine combustion experiments provided insights into jet flame details and\ncombustion characteristics. They found that the PC combustion mode offers\nnotable advantages, particularly at low loads, where conventional SI engines\nstruggle due to high pumping losses from throttling and low air exchange\nrates. Methanol active PC combustion operation enables smoother operation even\nunder ultra-lean conditions, thus decreasing the need for throttling and, in\nturn, decreasing pumping losses. Extensive simulations optimized engine\nperformance across a range of loads, evaluating the effects of overall \u03bb,\npiston and PC geometries, CR, and EGR on the engine combustion characteristics\nand emissions. Higher \u03bb yielded higher ITE; however, if tested without active\nfueling, misfire occurred at \u03bb = 2. Flat, U- and \u03c9-shaped pistons were\ncompared. The \u03c9 piston showed the highest heat losses, as the reacting jets\nwere directly impinged on the inner piston edge, resulting in the lowest\nefficiency but also lower NO_x emissions. The optimized pre-chamber shape\nappeared to be one exhibiting a wider throat and a more compact PC volume. The\noptimal engine performance was obtained at a CR of 14, as with higher CR the\nrisk of end-gas autoignition in the squish region increased. However, EGR\nimplementation at mid- and high-load conditions effectively mitigated end-gas\nautoignition and reduced NO_x formation.\n\nHlaing et al. [127] conducted comprehensive measurements on a similar Volvo\nD13C500 engine equipped with an active PC, fueling the MC with methanol,\nethanol, and n-butanol, while the PC was enriched with methane. Their findings\nunderscored the superior performance of methanol, particularly in terms of\ngross indicated efficiency and combustion duration. Methanol combustion\ndemonstrated shorter durations, attributed to its faster laminar burning\nvelocity, resulting in higher efficiency compared to other alcohols across\nvarying \u03bb values. Moreover, methanol operation exhibited superior combustion\nefficiency with lower levels of CO and HC emissions. Stable combustion was\nachieved across all tested fuels, with methanol showcasing the highest gross\nindicated efficiency, reaching up to 44% under non-optimized combustion\nphasing with a CR of 11.5. These findings highlight the potential of actively\nfueled methanol PC combustion in heavy-duty engine applications, offering\nefficient and clean combustion characteristics, particularly under leaner\noperating conditions.\n\nFor larger engines, only numerical work can be found in the literature. One\nsuch investigation was conducted by Leng et al. [130] on a medium-speed engine\nwith a 320 mm bore, a 420 mm stroke, a CR of 11.5, and a rated speed of 750\nrpm. The work shows that reliable ignition and combustion were achieved for\nthe lean MC mixture. The maximum ITE obtained was 49.2% at \u03bb = 2.4, and the\nIMEP was 20 bar. HC emissions at that operating point were as low as 0.1 g/kWh\nand NO_x was below 0.3 g/kWh. Further increasing \u03bb beyond 2.4 led to a rapidly\ndropping combustion efficiency, resulting in increased CO and HC emissions, as\nwell as a decrease in ITE.\n\n#### 4.3. Pre-Chamber-Enabled Mixing-Controlled Combustion\n\nWhile classical PC layouts can effectively suppress knock to some degree, they\noften fall short of completely eliminating knock, especially in large-bore\nengines. This limitation arises from the continued presence of a premixed\nair\u2013fuel mixture within the main chamber, which can lead to knocking phenomena\nwhen the bore size is increased. To address this challenge, a transition to\ndiffusive combustion, resembling the combustion found in CI engines, would be\nnecessary. However, as discussed in the preceding subsection, accomplishing\nthis transition is no straightforward task.\n\nIn a CI engine, fuel is directly injected into the combustion chamber, where\nit autoignites and forms a turbulent diffusion flame. This combustion strategy\nis also known as mixing-controlled combustion (MCC), as the rate of combustion\nis determined by the fuel\u2013air mixing rate. MCC engines operate on lean\nmixtures with high compression ratios, resulting in high combustion and\nthermodynamic efficiency. These engines are robust, exhibit good\ncontrollability, and can deliver high torque even at low speeds as pre-\nignition and knock are eliminated, in contrast to premixed fuel combustion\nprinciples. However, methanol, as a low-cetane fuel, presents challenges\nregarding autoignition. This is where a PC jet ignition system can be deployed\nto solve ignitability issues.\n\nA schematic of the combustion principle is provided in Figure 5. Similar to a\ndiesel engine, only air enters the combustion chamber during the intake\nstroke. During compression, the air is forced into the small PC (2\u20133% of\nclearance volume) through the orifices connecting the two chambers. A small\namount of methanol is injected into the PC, which is ignited by a spark.\nWithin the PC, a combustion process similar to that in a classical PC layout\noccurs. The flames are quenched upon passing through the orifices, and the\nhighly reactive chemical species with high thermal energy are expelled into\nthe MC. There, the main injection of the remaining fuel is introduced, ignited\nby the jet, which then burns in a mixing-controlled manner.\n\nFigure 5. Schematic diagram of PC-MCC, the pre-chamber jets ignite the high-\npressure direct-injection (HPDI) of the main charge. The star represents the\nspark.\n\nResearch regarding this relatively recent combustion concept is primarily\nlimited to simulations; nevertheless, it appears to be a promising strategy\nfor enabling the use of neat methanol in large-bore single-fuel methanol\nengines. The original layout proposed by Kammel et al. [124] involved using a\ntorus-shaped PC positioned around the centrally mounted injector, aiming to\nachieve both a centrally mounted injector and a centrally mounted PC, which is\nbeneficial for smaller engines with less engine head space, as only a single\nentry point is needed to the MC. This concept was adopted for simulating the\ncombustion of methanol in CFD for a 1.9 L engine with a bore of 82 mm,\nresulting in an indicated efficiency of 45.6% [123], close to the CFD\npredicted efficiency on diesel of 46.5%. However, this configuration results\nin a complex PC and injector system, with several drawbacks including\nchallenges for combustion within the annular PC, increased surface area for\nheat loss, and elevated injector tip temperatures of the main injector. A more\nrecent follow-up study [131] investigated both centrally and side-mounted PCs\nthat were not integrated with the main injector, aiming to enable the use of\nethanol as a fuel. The results of the simulation on a 115 mm bore engine\nindicated that both configurations would be viable for igniting the MC\nmixture. However, the side-mounted PC proved to be less sensitive to\nparameters such as spark timing in the PC.\n\nA distinction can also be made based on ignition timing, as spark timing\nsweeps revealed different operating regimes. One regime occurs when the PC\njets directly ignite the DI fuel spray, which happens when both the jet and\nmain injection overlap. Another type of combustion can be observed when the PC\nis fired sufficiently early, in which case, the PC jet primarily preheats the\nMC. Additionally, there is the option of a late PC ignition, where the jets\nignite a mixture that is already partially premixed. Investigating which\nregime is most beneficial for different emissions and efficiency at different\nload points would be interesting for future research.\n\nPC-MCC engines do not involve premixed air\u2013fuel mixtures within the combustion\nchamber, thereby eliminating end-gas autoignition. This theoretically enables\nthe utilization of this combustion principle in even the largest heavy-duty\nengines, particularly when compared to premixed PC principles that remain\nconstrained by knock. The feasibility of employing mixing-controlled\ncombustion with methanol is demonstrated by direct-injected dual-fuel\ndiesel\u2013methanol engines. In the PC-MCC concept, a similar combustion process\ntakes place, although with the substitution of the diesel pilot\u2014used for\ninitial ignition of the methanol sprays\u2014with a methanol pilot in the form of a\nPC jet. PC-MCC facilitates the use of higher compression ratios, leading to\nfurther improvements in efficiency. Although lower CO and UHC emissions are\nexpected due to MCC, the locally rich combustion could potentially result in\nincreased NO_x emissions compared to premixed concepts.\n\nPreliminary research indicates that PCs could serve as a stable and robust\nsolution to enable methanol combustion in an MCC manner. With well-timed jets\nigniting the methanol rapidly, the premixed combustion stage with fast\npressure rise, typical for CI engines due to the ignition delay, could even be\nskipped. This is advantageous, as these engines are often limited not by knock\nbut by maximum in-cylinder pressure rise rates. Mixing-controlled combustion\noffers excellent control of heat release and, consequently, combustion\nphasing, thereby overcoming the control limitations of other low-temperature\ncombustion technologies.\n\n#### 4.4. Discussion\n\nAll of the PC jet ignition technologies discussed in this section (as\nsummarized in Table 5) contribute to ignition enhancement to varying extents.\nThe primary objective of the turbulent jet is to achieve robust ignition of\nmethanol, considering that the use of methanol in heavy-duty engines is\nhindered by knocking phenomena and misfire. PC technology can facilitate this\nrobust ignition by employing jets containing highly reactive chemical species\nwith high thermal energy and turbulence, which serve as distributed ignition\nsources. These jets lead to shorter flame travel distances, thereby improving\ncombustion speed and subsequently enhancing efficiency. Particularly\nsignificantly in the heavy-duty context, this also results in a reduced\ntendency for engine knock, as the end-gas responsible for knock is consumed by\nthe flame front before it has the opportunity to autoignite.\n\nTable 5. Summary table of the PC concepts presented in Section 4.\n\nCombining methanol and PC technology allows for increased dilution of the\nmixture as a result of the rapid combustion induced by the combination of\nmethanol and a PC. This dilution can be achieved by either increasing the\nexcess air ratio or using EGR. Additionally, the higher dilution results in\nefficiency improvements and reduced emissions, meeting ultra-low standards.\nWith its lower tendency for knock, a PC approach permits higher compression\nratios to enhance efficiency even further or allows for higher bore sizes to\nobtain higher power output. The combination of methanol, with its high octane\nnumber, and the knock-suppressing characteristics of PC technology proves to\nbe an ideal match, enabling the utilization of this clean-burning renewable\nfuel in heavy-duty engines.\n\nThe primary advantages of passive PCs include improved stability, higher\nefficiency, and knock suppression compared to traditional SI engines at a\nlower level of complexity and cost. However, to operate at more diluted\nconditions, active enrichment of the PC through an additional fuel injector\nbecomes necessary. By expanding the lean-limit, active PC layouts also gain\nthe added benefit of more efficient low-temperature combustion, which\ncorrelates with reduced NO_x emissions. There exists a concept aimed at\nextending the lean limit of a passive PC without requiring an additional\ninjector within the PC. This concept, known as the bowl PC ignition concept\n(BPI) [109], involves a passive PC, a piston bowl, and a direct injector\npointing at the bowl. With BPI, two injections occur: one during the intake\nstroke, resulting in a lean pre-mixed mixture in the MC, and a second, smaller\ninjection during the compression stroke in the piston bowl, injecting\napproximately 3% of the total fuel mass. The objective is to channel the\nadditional fuel towards the PC, resulting in a richer PC mixture, combining\nthe advantages of passive and active PCs. However, this concept has not yet\nbeen explored for the utilization of methanol.\n\nPC-MCC combustion has the potential to completely eliminate knocking\nphenomena, since there is no pre-mixed air\u2013fuel mixture present in the\ncombustion chamber to cause knock. This opens up opportunities for all engine\nsizes, as the maximum bore is no longer limited by end-gas autoignition. This\napproach would lead to lower CO and UHC emissions, thanks to the MCC of the\nfuel. However, the locally rich combustion may lead to higher NO_x emissions\ncompared to the other PC principles. Nevertheless, due to the cooling power of\nmethanol, NO_x emissions should still be lower than those from comparable\ndiesel engines.\n\nAlthough PC combustion systems have been around since the early 20th century,\nthe utilization of methanol as a fuel in PC engines is a relatively recent\ndevelopment. Presently, research and investigations into these methanol PC\nengines primarily focus on smaller, light-duty engines comparable to those\nfound in passenger cars. Passive PCs are already well-established in larger\ngas engines, making them relatively straightforward to convert to methanol\noperation. However, for active PC layouts, most experimental results are\nlimited to bore sizes of 130 mm, which remain the smaller engines within the\nheavy-duty sector. Research into larger-bore engines is still predominantly\nconfined to simulation work, highlighting the pressing need for further\nresearch regarding the utilization of neat methanol as a single-fuel solution\nin larger PC engines.\n\n## 5\\. Conclusions\n\nThis review presented the state-of-the-art research and development of spark-\nignition, compression-ignition, and pre-chamber technologies that enable\nrenewable methanol to be utilized as a sole fuel for powering heavy-duty\nengines.\n\nOverall, the characteristics of methanol, such as its high octane (thus, low\ncetane) number and strong evaporative cooling effect upon injection, favor\nspark-ignited combustion and pose challenges for compression-ignition\ncombustion. This explains why spark-ignition lab-scale demonstrators are\ncapable of operating from part-load to full-load while compression-ignition\ndemonstrators, though being extensively researched and showing great\npotential, mostly lack a comprehensive solution covering all loads and speeds.\nThe compression-ignition solution that has already been proven is the use of\nan ignition improver, which has been field-tested in the real world with\nexcellent results, but the same also applies to the direct-injected spark-\nignited engine of similar size field-tested in China. The fact that blending\nin an ignition improver fuel necessitates an additional process and adds extra\ncost associated with the ignition improver renders it a less-attractive\nsolution. Given that there are still scarce test results from methanol-fueled\nengines employing pre-chambers, it is fair to conclude that spark-ignited\nengines on methanol exhibit the highest technology readiness level among the\nthree technologies discussed in this review.\n\nHowever, spark-ignited engines are also the ones with the most obvious\nlimitation in terms of bore size and power output due to knock, thus\nconstraining their use in heavy-duty engines. The premixed type of combustion\ncan potentially go much further with the help of a pre-chamber, as natural gas\nengines utilizing pre-chambers have a bore size up to 500 mm. It is expected\nthat a similar configuration would also work well with methanol.\n\nAs for compression-ignition of neat methanol, despite being challenging,\ndemonstrators have shown similar or better efficiency and emissions compared\nto diesel once stable combustion was achieved. Increasing the compression\nratio and utilizing advanced injection strategies are both promising\napproaches to facilitate stable combustion, while glow plugs have been proven\nto be effective at start-up and low loads. Further research into the\ncombination of these concepts is necessary to determine the optimal\nconfiguration that can cover the wide range of speeds, loads, and dynamic\nrequirements of heavy-duty applications.\n\nEmploying an active pre-chamber alongside a high-pressure in-cylinder injector\nhas recently emerged as another viable solution. It holds promise to enable\nstable mixing-controlled combustion of neat methanol in all engine sizes,\nresulting in an efficient combustion without knock limitation. However, its\ncomplicated architecture makes it less suitable for smaller-bore engines.\n\nTo conclude, for heavy-duty engines with a displacement around 2 L per\ncylinder, operating on methanol is already proven with spark-ignition and\ncompression-ignition using an ignition improver. However, for engines with a\ndisplacement above that, there are still uncertainties over which technology\nwill work best for different applications. Therefore, further research and\ndevelopment is needed to drive the heavy-duty sector towards a sustainable,\nnet-zero future.\n\n## Author Contributions\n\nY.-H.P., Q.D. and M.S. contributed equally to this paper.

These standards are detailed in Table A1 with a\nnumber of selected non-road HD applications (NRE stands for mobile machinery;\nNRG stands for generator set; IWP/A stands for propulsion and auxiliary\nengines for inland waterway vessels; and RLR stands for railcars). While\ninland waterway vessels fall within the scope of Stage V, ocean-going vessels\nsailing in Emission Control Areas (ECA) need to follow the IMO Tier III NO_x\nlimit. This limit is a function of the engine speed; it is 3.4 g/kWh when the\nengine speed is below 130 rpm, gradually tightens with increasing engine\nspeed, and reaches 1.96 g/kWh for an engine speed above 2000 rpm.\n\nTable A1.
