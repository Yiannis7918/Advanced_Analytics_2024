And this is especially true of pulque. If you want to\ndrink good pulque, you have to go to Mexico. It's literally unavailable\neverywhere else. There's nothing more Mexican than pulque.\n\nPulque is a milky-white alcoholic beverage made from the fermented sap of the\nagave plant. It can taste sour or sweet, viscous or watery and flat or fizzy,\nall depending on the agave used, length of fermentation and flavorings, if\nany, added by the curator.\n\nPulque is a delicate, fermented drink with a very short shelf life. And\ntransporting pulque ruins it, so good pulque can't be transported. (In recent\nyears, some makers have figured out how to sell it canned or bottled, but the\nstuff is nowhere near as good as fresh.)\n\n## Where pulque comes from\n\nOnly a few agave species are good for making pulque. In Oaxaca, the agaves are\ncalled pulqueros. The plants grow for 12 years, give or take a few, depending\non the species. When their lifespan is almost done, they shoot a tall seeding\nstalk out of the top of the plant called quiote. Pulque growers chop this off\nfrom the very bottom of the plant, leaving a cylindrical hole in the middle or\nheart of the plant, called a cajete, which naturally fills with watery sap,\ncalled aguamiel (honey water).\n\nThis sweet and delicious liquid starts to ferment immediately, because of the\nyeast and bacteria naturally present on the plant and in the air \u2014 and because\nof the sugar content of the liquid. Pulque makers remove the aguamiel, then\nallow the fermentation to continue in tanks, clay ceramic vessels or barrels.\nAguamiel is typically harvested twice a day, at dawn and dusk. They extract\nthe aguamiel using a jicara (a bowl made from a round gourd) or, when the\ncajete gets deep, by using a long dried gourd called an acocote, which they\nuse for siphoning.\n\nThe person who collects and manages the aguamiel, called a tlachiquero, has to\nbe careful to fully cover and seal the top with rocks and agave leaves (which\nare very sturdy) because rodents and bugs love aguamiel as much as people do.\nSome agave plants produce up to 15 pints of aguamiel per day until the plant\ndies months later (usually 3 to 4 months depending on the species of the\nagave). After removing the aguamiel each time, the tlachiquero needs to reach\ninto the hole and scrape the sides to keep the plant producing.\n\nIt takes one to a few days for pulque to ferment depending on the climate,\nachieving between 3 and 7 percent alcohol (typically 5 or 6 percent, roughly\nsimilar in alcohol content to a standard beer). The ferment is often fortified\nusing a standard \"backslopping\" method of adding already fermented pulque to\nthe freshly harvested aguamiel.\n\nPulque sellers add flavors, like fruit juice or nuts. And oftentimes it's sold\nplain (natural) with nothing added, which is our favorite. In fact, the\naddition of flavorings is the only part that's \"made.\" Plain pulque is just\nthe sap that's been allowed to ferment.\n\n## A brief history of pulque\n\nThe origin of pulque consumption is unknown, but goes back at least 3,000\nyears, based on archeological evidence. This is different from Mexico's other\nagave drink, mezcal (including tequila), which originated after the Spanish\narrived.\n\nVarious Mexican indigenous cultures have pulque origin stories, and they're\nmostly related to human origin stories and they're all highly complex and\ninvolved. Most of these stories involve \"Mayahuel,\" who is depicted as either\na goddess or a mortal woman. In the stories where \"Mayahuel\" is a goddess, the\naguamiel is said to be her blood.\n\nThe Mexica (the Aztecs who ruled parts of Mexico from what is now Mexico City)\nhad strict rules for pulque consumption. It was used by elites for ceremonies,\nby pregnant and lactating women for nutrition and the elderly, who were\nallowed to get drunk as long as they didn't do it in public. Other groups had\ntheir own restrictions. But because pulque was sacred (and represented the\nconnection between the human, divine and natural worlds) it was almost never\nconsumed recreationally.\n\nMost restrictions were lifted under Spanish rule. Pulque bars, called\npulquerias, became ubiquitous and developed their own unique culture. Pulque\nbecame highly and almost exclusively recreational.\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletter!\n\nIn the late 16th Century, Jesuits bought land around Mexico City and started\ngrowing and making pulque on an industrial level. When the Jesuits were\nexpelled from Mexico in 1767, their operations were taken over by locals or by\nthe Spanish crown.\n\nWhen late nineteenth Century trains connected rural agave-growing areas\n(mostly Hidalgo and Tlaxcala) to the major cities, the pulque flowed like\nwine. Pulque making haciendas became rich, like oil barons. Pulque was\nMexico's top drink and one of its biggest agricultural products, some calling\nit \"white gold.\"\n\nBy the turn of the 20th Century, there were more than 1,000 pulque bars,\ncalled pulquerias, in Mexico City alone. Even small towns had pulquerias, and\npulque was the main alcohol drink of the Mexico people. But this changed when\nEuropean immigrants started mass-producing and mass-marketing beer during the\n20th Century. Some Mexican leaders encouraged beer over mezcal because it was\nmore sanitary, modern and easier to tax.\n\n## The new world of pulque\n\nDuring the 19th and early 20th Centuries, pulque was associated with\ndrunkenness, criminality and antisocial behavior. Even today, many pulquerias\nare places where regulars get completely drunk.\n\nSide by side with the traditional pulque culture and old pulquerias, the drink\nis currently becoming popular with young, urban hipsters, and its popularity\nis growing.\n\nWe've sampled pulque in Mexico City, Yucatan and Oaxaca. And the best we've\ntried is in the Oaxaca valley. The multi-generational families ferment and\nsell pulque in the same place. These are typically small producers who have\njust a few agave pulqueros producing at a time, which they visit at dawn and\nat dusk to collect the aguamiel and they store in red clay ceramic vessels.\nThey neither transport it after fermentation nor over-ferment it, and the\nquality of both aguamiel and the pulque is very high.\n\nExploring the world of pulque and mezcal in Oaxaca is perhaps one of the most\nprofound foodie experiences we offer in this part of the world, and something\nwe are personally passionate about.\n\nDrinking \"white gold\" in a pulqueria typically visited only by locals in a\nlittle village surrounded by agave fields is incredibly beautiful and\npoignant. Drinking freshly harvested aguamiel from a jicara handed to you\ndirectly from the tlachiquero in the middle of agave fields as the sun goes\ndown behind the Oxacan mountains is a life-changing experience. It\u2019s a\nreminder of the simple pleasures that make life beautiful and joyful.\n\nIf you want to try the world's most amazing drinks and foods, you have to\ntravel. And if you want to try good pulque, you have to travel to Mexico. But\nif you want to drink pulque in the presence of Mayahuel herself in the Oaxaca\nValley, you really should join us on The Oaxaca Gastronomad Experience.\n\nShare\n\nLove the blog?
