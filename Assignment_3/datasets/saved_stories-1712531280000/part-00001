Tirpak\n\nMarch 28, 2024\n\nShare Article\n\n> USAF launches its most ambitious new aircraft program in a generation. Can\n> Collaborative Combat Aircraft tilt the numbers game in America\u2019s favor?\n\nThe ambitious goal: Initial operational capability in as little as five years.\n\nAir Force leaders think that\u2019s possible because production-representative\nprototypes already have flown, and because the urgency to field combat mass is\nintensifying as China gets closer to its stated goal of having the military\ncapability to take Taiwan by force in 2027.\n\nTo counter China\u2019s growing military might, the USAF envisions acquiring at\nleast 1,000 and possibly up to 2,000 CCA by the mid-2030s. That would make the\nautonomous combat jets among its most numerous assets. By contrast, the Air\nForce has only a little more than 400 F-35s today out of a total planned buy\nof 1,763\u2014a number it can\u2019t achieve at present acquisition rates before 2040.\n\nIf their promise bears out, CCA could restore the Air Force\u2019s combat\nmass\u2014eroded by overuse and slower-than-anticipated acquisition over the past\ntwo decades. It could also stimulate a host of new entrants into the service\u2019s\nindustrial base.\n\n> We can never afford\u201d ... enough crewed combat airplanes to sustain a\n> numerical edge [over China].\n>\n> Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall\n\nSecretary Frank Kendall and other senior Air Force leaders outlined their CCA\nplans at the 2024 AFA Warfare Symposium in Aurora, Colo., in February. They\ndeclared there\u2019s \u201cno time to lose\u201d in fielding these new assets. More mass is\nneeded to counter the growing numbers and capability of China\u2019s air arms and\ncounter-air capabilities, as well as those of other potential adversaries.\nUSAF\u2019s combat fleet is the smallest and oldest in its 77-year history. The\nU.S. can\u2019t win a numbers contest against China\u2019s military, which can build\nequipment at practically whatever rate it wants, with no Congress or free\npress to answer to.\n\n\u201cWe can never afford\u201d enough crewed combat airplanes to sustain a numerical\nedge, Kendall said.\n\nUncrewed, autonomous aircraft can be cheaper to build and operate than those\nwith pilots on board because they don\u2019t need life support, control devices, or\nescape systems. Those add up to more weight, and weight adds cost. A pilot\nalso imposes performance limits: While an uncrewed aircraft can easily take a\n10-plus-G turn, a human pilot generally can\u2019t.\n\nBy contrast to an F-35A, costing $80 million to $100 million apiece, each CCA\nis targeted to cost only about 25 to 30 percent as much. That\u2019s still about\n$30 million per aircraft, but a huge savings overall, especially when\npurchased in volume. CCA will generally cost too much for many one-way\nmissions\u2014although service leaders say that will be up to the tactical\ncommander to decide\u2014but compared to a crewed fighter, they\u2019ll be a bargain.\n\n### FAST PACE\n\nThe contracts awarded this spring will be for a basic \u201cIncrement 1\u201d CCA with\nsensor, targeting, and munition systems similar to those on crewed fighters\nand bombers. CCA missions could include jamming, suppression of enemy air\ndefenses, and as decoys to \u201csoak up\u201d enemy missiles and enable crewed fighters\nand bombers to reach their targets.\n\n\u201cIncrement 2\u201d CCA will follow next year, with the aim of greater stealth and\nautonomy.\n\nMaj. Gen. R. Scott Jobe, director of force design, integration, and wargaming\nand deputy chief of staff for Air Force Futures said Increment 2 capabilities,\ncost, and relative sophistication will depend on what industry offers in the\ncoming year. While a high-end, \u201cexquisite\u201d platform could result, so might an\ninexpensive solution oriented around a single mission, Jobe said, adding,\n\u201cnothing has been ruled out.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s possible two distinct solutions could emerge from this stage, one high\nend, the other more basic.\n\nAndrew Hunter, assistant secretary of the Air Force for acquisition,\ntechnology, and logistics, said Increment 2 could have \u201ca very different set\nof requirements\u201d compared to Increment 1. He said the Air Force is\ncoordinating its development with the Navy, Marine Corps, and foreign\npartners, and that those wider partnerships could yield a future \u201cIncrement\n3.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeed Racer\u201d is one of Lockheed Martin\u2019s modular, uncrewed aircraft ideas,\nshown here in concept artwork flying with an Air Force F-35. The ghostly\noutline suggests a decoy mission. It was developed under what the company says\nis a $100 million investment in \u201cProject Carrera,\u201d a suite of manned-unmanned\nteaming technologies. Lockheed Martin illustration\n\nProgress thus far has been rapid. Brig. Gen. Jason D. Voorheis, program\nexecutive officer for fighters and advanced aircraft, credited the close\ncollaboration among Air Combat Command, the Air Force Research Laboratory, Air\nForce Materiel Command, and industry with shortening the development cycle.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve ... developed market research, they\u2019ve done operational analysis,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cThey\u2019ve done concept refinement, defined operational attributes, got an\nacquisition strategy approved, and then went on contract for building\nproduction-representative test articles in under two years, which is a pretty\nphenomenal pace.\u201d\n\nThis \u201cextreme partnership will be the norm going forward,\u201d he predicted,\nespecially after the formation of the Air Force\u2019s new Integrated Capabilities\nCommand, announced during the AFA Warfare Symposium in February.\n\n\u201cGovernment-owned open architectures for both mission systems and autonomy\u201d\nwill be crucial to these systems, Voorheis said. That central ownership of the\ncommon elements will free the Air Force from historical \u201cprime and sub-vendor\nlock,\u201d where the initial contract fixes a single supplier of all future\nrevision and upgrade contracts. Without proprietary intellectual property,\ncompetition can continue with each successive increment, enabling future\nupgrades from a host of competitors.\n\nThese architectures \u201cenable rapid technology insertion and rapid fielding of\nsoftware-defined, platform-agnostic capabilities over time,\u201d Voorheis said.\nThe CCA ecosystem is already extensive, with more than 30 industry\nparticipants involved in \u201cautonomy, air vehicles, mission systems, and\nsoftware development.\u201d Continued competition can keep those players in the\ngame, and potentially attract new entrants in the future.\n\nHunter said digital design and modeling are making it possible to understand\n\u201cdaily\u201d the evolving configurations and options, and he suggested that\nchoosing winners should be comparatively obvious when the time comes.\n\n\u201cWe ... have really gotten [that] right,\u201d he said.\n\nIn place of the conventional, rigid requirements process, Hunter described how\nCCA development is fueling \u201ccontinuous daily engagement\u201d among the government\nand its vendors. By the time the competition reaches the endgame, Hunter said,\nindustry will not be guessing what the government wants, and the government\nwill have a clearer understanding of which vendors best deliver on the goal.\n\n### TEAM EFFORT\n\nA \u201cslew\u201d of contractors are developing the software that will fly the CCA,\nbuilding off of the Air Force Research Laboratory\u2019s Skyborg program, the\n\u201cfoundational architecture\u201d for a standardized autonomous flying algorithm.\n\nCompanies in the running for Increment 1 are Anduril, Boeing, General Atomics,\nLockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman. Those not picked, such as Kratos, which\nhad been a key player in earlier development, will be able to compete later,\nin Increment 2, or after. Kratos has said it plans to compete for Increment 2.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t read too much into that short list,\u201d an Air Force official said. \u201cWe\nare not ignoring any expertise that is out there.\u201d\n\nAll the Increment 1 competitors have done extensive work on both remotely\npiloted and autonomous aircraft, and on manned-unmanned teaming of aircraft\nsystems.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to go to at least two\u201d designs for the next stage of development,\nKendall told reporters at the conference. \u201cOur preference\u201d is to carry three\ncontractors into the next phase, he said, but that will be \u201cdifficult, because\nof the level of funding we have in the budget.\u201d\n\nA U.S. Air Force F-22 Raptor and F-35A Lightning II fly in formation with the\nKratos XQ-58A Valkyrie low-cost unmanned aerial vehicle over the U.S. Army\nYuma Proving Ground testing range during a series of tests in 2020. Tech. Sgt.\nJames Cason\n\nWhether more players stay in the game could depend on how much they might be\nwilling to share in the cost of development.The Air Force wants to preserve\ncompetition on CCA for as long as possible, to keep contractors focused on\ninnovation, fresh ideas, and driving costs down.\n\nEven after the competitive development phase, though, Kendall revealed that\nthe Air Force could, if funding permits, greenlight two Increment 1 designs\nfor production.\n\n\u201cHow many we will carry into production is uncertain,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will\ndefinitely do one.\u201d That contract is targeted for 2026. There\u2019s \u201ca possibility\nwe could do more,\u201d he added, indicating the service is \u201cworking out some way\nto do that.\u201d\n\nIncrement 2 could involve international partners, Kendall said. Boeing is\nexpected to offer its MQ-28 Ghost Bat, developed under contract with\nAustralia, for Increment 1 and/or Increment 2. Though Kendall didn\u2019t identify\nallies that might participate in CCA, any that do will be among \u201cour closest\npartners.\u201d\n\n### AUTONOMY\n\nHunter said the technology demonstrated so far provides \u201ca high degree of\nconfidence that we can deliver a useful degree of autonomy\u201d in the first\nincrement, but not as much, perhaps, as originally hoped for.\n\nThe Air Force wants hardware it can deliver into the hands of operators as\nquickly as possible, Kendall said, indicating he anticipates doing so in 2028.\n\nTo further expedite delivery, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David W. Allvin\nsaid questions about development, basing, and training are all being\naddressedconcurrently, and experimentation with surrogate aircraft and\nplatforms is happening now to \u201cshape how we would use\u201d and integrate CCA when\nthey join the force.\n\nAFA\u2019s Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies concluded, after a series of\nwargames last year, that large numbers of more basic, less-costly CCAs would\nyield a greater impact than fewer, high-end systems in a battle against China.\n\nThe wargames, which included Active-duty operators and others, found that\nrather than using CCA as uncrewed \u201cescorts\u201d for manned aircraft, they could\ninstead be sent out on their own to tackle missions independently. They could\nalso operate semi-independently, taking off from their own location to meet up\nwith crewed aircraft for one phase of a mission, then continue on their own\nafterward, or potentially cover the escape of crewed aircraft heading back to\nbase.\n\nConcerns that fighter pilots could be task-saturated managing CCAs in addition\nto their primary mission proved unfounded, Jobe said. F-22 pilots in such\nexperiments demonstrated they can comfortably manage \u201cup to six\u201d CCAs without\ninterfering with their other tasks.\n\nRobert Winkler, Kratos vice president of corporate development for national\nsecurity, said the Mitchell wargames showed CCA would have the greatest impact\noperating \u201cinside the first island chain,\u201d a reference to the first string of\nislands off the coast of mainland China. Spreading them out in that region\ngave \u201cthe enemy a much harder targeting solution,\u201d operating from austere\nlocations \u201cor being air-launched.\u201d\n\nIntroducing CCAs \u201ccompletely trashed, for lack of a better term, the enemy\u2019s\nscheme of maneuver and strategy,\u201d Winkler said. \u201cIt disrupted their ability to\ndo [defensive counter-air]. It disrupted their pulsed operations, and it made\nour ... operations ... an order of magnitude more effective. It made manned\naircraft more survivable and unmanned aircraft more survivable, and it reduced\nthe overall tanker requirements.\u201d\n\nIn fact, CCAs \u201cproved out\u201d the Agile Combat Employment model, he said.\n\nBut the notion that CCAs might be expendable has not been borne out so far.\nJobe said CCAs could be used on one-way missions if the target is considered\nimportant enough, but that the plan is not to do so routinely. Once thought of\nas platforms that would not be sustained long-term, it now appears they will\nrequire maintenance, even if some remain crated up\u2014possibly pre-positioned at\nforward bases\u2014until needed.\n\nJobe said CCA \u201creally changes ... our capability, our resourcing, ... and our\ntopline investment.\u201d\n\nBecause of that, it can reduce the incremental cost of gaining new\ncapabilities, he noted. \u201cIt\u2019s really disruptive over multiple areas.\u201d\n\nCCAs also present \u201ca lot of dilemmas to the adversary or potential\nadversaries,\u201d he said. With them in the mix, the scheme of maneuver will\nchange, and the enemy will have to adapt. \u201cIt presents a lot of options,\u201d Jobe\nsaid, for things \u201cwe just haven\u2019t been able to do before because of the ...\nrisk levels and force packaging that we would have had to do in the past.\u201d\n\nDavid Alexander, president of General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, said\nindustry offerings for Increment 1 will likely wind up looking similar and\nhaving comparable capabilities. Speaking on the Mitchell Institute\u2019s\n\u201cAerospace Advantage\u201d podcast, he praised the clarity of the Air Force\u2019s\nvision.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a crystal-clear mission, crystal-clear requirements,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t speak for the other four [competitors] but physics is going\nto drive us all into something very similar. I think when [the Air Force]\ngives you a range ... an altitude and ... a speed and so on, that requires\nairframes to be designed for those; what we would call a \u2018point design.\u2019 And\nto meet that point design, ... I would expect them to be very similar ...\nacross the five.\u201d\n\nThe companies are all working to \u201cthe same requirements,\u201d Alexander said, but\nthere is room for \u201cinterpretation.\u201d As a result, \u201csome slightly different\nofferings, perhaps in the systems, sensors, and payloads\u201d are possible. But\n\u201cairframe-wise\u201d the overall mission \u201cis the same for all.\u201d\n\n### COST-EFFECTIVENESS\n\nGeneral Atomics was picked in February by Air Force Research Laboratory to\ndesign and build the Off-Board Sensing Station (OBSS) aircraft, which will\nexplore data-sharing technologies hosted on an autonomous drone. Given an\n\u201cX-plane\u201d designation\u2014the XQ-67A\u2014the aircraft made its first flight in late\nFebruary. General Atomics beat Kratos for the work, after both developed\nplatforms all the way through a critical design review.\n\nThe program is one of several efforts in AFRL\u2019s Autonomous Collaborative\nEnabling Technologies program.\n\nWinkler said CCAs will need new, smaller, and lower-cost weapons and sensors\noptimized for them, or to rely on off-board systems. If the Air Force wants a\n\u201creasonably costed\u201d CCA system, \u201cwe can\u2019t go with exquisite sensors\u201d such as\nthose now deployed on fighters and bombers. \u201cWe have to figure out how to\nbring the sensor cost down.\u201d\n\nThat approach must be applied across the board to hold costs down. Otherwise,\nhe added, \u201cif you try to build a CCA like a manned aircraft, it\u2019s going to\ncost like a manned aircraft.\u201d\n\nThe XQ-67A Off-Board Sensing Station\u2014an Air Force Research Laboratory\nproject\u2014takes off on its first flight Feb. 28, 2024, from Gray Butte Field\nAirport in Palmdale, Calif. Built by General Atomics, the aircraft will\nconduct flight tests and experiments to collect and disseminate information in\nthe battlespace; one of many autonomous aircraft paving the way for the\nwidespread use of CCAs. Courtesy photo\n\nThis approach will flow through all the subcontractors, including the engine\nmakers. Mark Rettig, vice president and general manager of business\ndevelopment at GE Aerospace\u2019s \u201cEdison Works,\u201d said his company is investing\n\u201cheavily\u201d in new classes of engines specific to CCA applications.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re partnered with another low-cost provider to give us a comprehensive\nteam to address the needs of these platforms,\u201d he said, but did not disclose\nthe name of the partner company.\n\nTom Jones, Northrop Grumman\u2019s aeronautics sector president, said there are\n\u201ctwo different time scales\u201d for the CCA: first to get the technology to\noperators so they can \u201cstart to experiment with it and understand what the\ntechnology brings,\u201d and second, scaling up to high-rate production.\n\nThat means reusing \u201cas much technology as you can,\u201d Jones said. As a result,\nhe added, \u201cI view this as an integration program rather than a development\nprogram.\u201d\n\nNorthrop built the first B-21 bomber on production tooling, having worked out\nthe bugs before production began, Jones remarked, and Northrop aims to follow\na similar approach to the CCA.\n\nBy using digital engineering, participants can \u201cburn down risk, ... iterate\nsignificantly faster,\u201d and avoid the pitfall of building bespoke one-offs and\nthen having to think about manufacturing as an add-on at the end.\n\n\u201cWe have much more opportunity to bring in manufacturing engineers, bring in\nlogistics people and make sure we get those things baked in, which means a\nsmoother transition into production,\u201d according to Jones. That makes the Air\nForce\u2019s timetable \u201cdoable.\u201d\n\nOnce deployed, Alexander said CCAs must be designed to operate with fewer\npeople and to require less scheduled maintenance.\n\nCost and time will be saved, he said, by keeping \u201cthat focus on production.\u201d\n\nAir\n\nNational Security\n\n## Related Content\n\n## T-6 Makes Emergency Landing in Texas, No Injuries Reported\n\nApril 5, 2024\n\nAn Air Force T-6 Texan II aircraft made an emergency landing at Joint Base San\nAntonio-Randolph, Texas, on April 3.
