Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t have the luck\nto meet him in person (living on a different part of the planet definitely\ndidn\u2019t help). Still, I did meet him through his book The Mythical Man-Month,\nwhich I read during my student years. Programming lore masters held it as an\nall-time classic, so my curiosity was kindled... and I was not disappointed!\n\nThere\u2019s lots to say about Brooks\u2019 book, but I\u2019ll skip that to keep the article\nshort^1. I just wanted to quote a section of the first chapter that resonated\ndeeply with me, because his words read like an ode to programming^2. They echo\nin many ways my own thoughts, but are expressed with more beauty than I could\nwish to achieve myself. Therefore, dear reader, now you have been brought by\nfate to this corner of the internet, let me delight you with the following\npoem in prose.\n\n> The Joys of the Craft\n>\n> Why is programming fun? What delights may its practitioner expect as his\n> reward?\n>\n> First is the sheer joy of making things. As the child delights in his mud\n> pie, so the adult enjoys building things, especially things of his own\n> design. I think this delight must be an image of God\u2019s delight in making\n> things, a delight shown in the distinctness and newness of each leaf and\n> each snowflake.\n>\n> Second is the pleasure of making things that are useful to other people.\n> Deep within, we want others to use our work and to find it helpful. In this\n> respect the programming system is not essentially different from the child\u2019s\n> first clay pencil holder \u201cfor Daddy\u2019s office.\u201d\n>\n> Third is the fascination of fashioning complex puzzle-like objects of\n> interlocking moving parts and watching them work in subtle cycles, playing\n> out the consequences of principles built in from the beginning. The\n> programmed computer has all the fascination of the pinball machine or the\n> jukebox mechanism, carried to the ultimate.\n>\n> Fourth is the joy of always learning, which springs from the nonrepeating\n> nature of the task. In one way or another the problem is ever new, and its\n> solver learns something: sometimes practical, sometimes theoretical, and\n> sometimes both.\n>\n> Finally, there is the delight of working in such a tractable medium. The\n> programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-\n> stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by the exertion\n> of the imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish\n> and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures....\n>\n> Yet the program construct, unlike the poet\u2019s words, is real in the sense\n> that it moves and works, producing visible outputs separate from the\n> construct itself. It prints results, draws pictures, produces sounds, moves\n> arms. The magic of myth and legend has come true in our time. One types the\n> correct incantation on a keyboard, and a display screen comes to life,\n> showing things that never were nor could be.\n>\n> Programming then is fun because it gratifies creative longings built deep\n> within us and delights sensibilities we have in common with all men.\n>\n> \u2013 Fred Brooks\n\n  1. You can always go to the Wikipedia article linked above, or go and actually read the book! \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  2. Note that Brooks isn\u2019t a naive optimist who only saw the attractive side of programming. He also wrote a section called The Woes of the Craft, where he mentions the less pleasant aspects of developing software.
