Brian, recipient of a 2012\nPrinceton Library Research Grant, following her August 2012 research project\nwith Cotsen Children\u2019s Library special collection materials: \u201cThe Wider &\nWhiter World in German Mechanical Books.\u201d Dr. Brian is currently assistant\nprofessor of history at Coastal Carolina University in Conway, SC.\n\n## Lothar Meggendorfer\u2019s Mechanical Books\n\nby Amanda M. Brian\n\nBeginning in the 1970s, pop-up books enjoyed a kind of renaissance in the\nUnited States. Within this trend, the name of Lothar Meggendorfer (1847-1925)\nwas continually floated as an early master of movable illustrations in\nchildren\u2019s books. Meggendorfer began his career as an illustrator for the\nMunich-based humor magazines Fliegende Bl\u00e4tter and then M\u00fcnchener Bilderbogen.\nLike several of his colleagues at these publications, Meggendorfer became a\ncrossover success in the world of late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century\nchildren\u2019s literature. His books became bestsellers during his lifetime; the\nmost popular went into multiple editions and were translated into many\nlanguages.\n\nLothar Meggendorfer, Gute Bekannte (Stuttgart: W. Nitzsche, c. 1880), p. 25.\n\nIt seems he was aware of both his influence and its monetary reward, for he\nincluded a telling self-portrait in which he stood at an easel and received a\ncommission in Gute Bekannte. This discovery was one of several unexpected and\ndeeply satisfying moments that I experienced as a researcher in the Rare Book\nDivision at the Princeton University Library.\n\nMoreover, Meggendorfer\u2019s books were frequently reproduced and widely\ndistributed along a German-British publishing network, which then collapsed in\nthe face of World War I. After the war, Meggendorfer continued his work in\npuppet theater, a passion that had clearly influenced his figures\u2019 exaggerated\nphysiognomy, especially their large noses and wide mouths.\n\nThen in 1975, the New York book dealer Justin G. Schiller purchased and\nprepared a catalog of a cache of production files found in J. F. Schreiber\u2019s\nEsslingen warehouse for what was believed at the time to be the entire\nsurviving Meggendorfer archive. Maurice Sendak provided an aptly named\n\u201cAppreciation\u201d in Schiller\u2019s The Publishing Archive of Lothar Meggendorfer,\nadding to a certain frenzy for Meggendorfer\u2019s books, particularly his movable\nbooks. Following this advertising, between 1979 and 1982, five of\nMeggendorfer\u2019s most popular movable books were reissued and reproduced,\nculminating in 1985 in a kind of anthology of his most intricate and humorous\npull-tab illustrations, The Genius of Lothar Meggendorfer. This relatively\nrecent attention has cemented Meggendorfer\u2019s reputation as a paper-engineering\nmaster on both sides of the North Atlantic. It is, therefore, not too\nsurprising to find such an extensive collection of Meggendorfer\u2019s children\u2019s\nbooks in the United States; the Cotsen Children\u2019s Library has perhaps the best\nexamples of his works States-side, which is particularly impressive\nconsidering the wear and tear movable illustrations from over a century ago\nhave taken.\n\nCotsen Children\u2019s Library also houses an almost equal number of Meggendorfer\u2019s\nnon-movable books to his movable books. This acts as a kind of corrective to\nthe amount of attention afforded his pull-tabs and panoramas at the expense of\nhis overall production of texts and images. His self-portrait, after all, was\nin the non-movable Gute Bekannte. A collection that just focused on\nMeggendorfer\u2019s elaborate pull-tabs\u2013which, do not misunderstand me, are\nimpressive with their simultaneous movements achieved by paper levers attached\nto small copper rivets hidden between the pages\u2013would overlook the non-\nmoveable (in the scholarly definition of movable parts) but equally\ninteractive Nimm mich mit!\n\nLothar Meggendorfer, Nimm mich mit! Ein lehrreiches Bilderbuch, 5th ed.\n(Munich: Braun & Schneider, c. 1890), cover and p. 173.\n\nThis small, 8 centimeters by 24 centimeters, picture book was designed for the\nnon-reading, or read-to, child to \u201ctake along\u201d around the home and into the\nfield to compare the drawn object to the real object. It presented a\ncomprehensive catalog of things in the child\u2019s \u201cgarden and room\u201d to be\nexamined \u201cwith love,\u201d as the introduction explained. For example, pages 125 to\n184, the largest section of the book, portrayed animals with skill at\nexpressive caricatures. Many of these animals could have been found in the\nchild\u2019s backyard (e.g., chicken and grasshooper), nearby woods (e.g., deer and\nhedgehog), or traveling menagerie (e.g., elephant and parrot), but some of\nthese animals (e.g., whale and ostrich), the child would not have seen in\nnature.\n\nIn Meggendorfer\u2019s oeuvre, animals were the most pervasive theme, followed by\nmusic. Focusing on the content and not just the mechanics of his works, it is\nclear that Meggendorfer\u2019s audience was expected to identify and enjoy both\ndomestic and foreign animals. But there were clear differences between how he\nportrayed domestics\u2013meaning both native to Europe and pervasive in his\naudience\u2019s lives, like dogs, horses, and sparrows\u2013and exotics\u2013meaning non-\nnative to Europe and perceived as wild by his audience, like elephants, lions,\nand apes. How domestic and exotic animals behaved differently became\ninstructive in Meggendorfer\u2019s books, representing hierarchies among and\nbetween Europeans and non-Europeans, and teaching his middle-class youthful\naudience about their place in the world.\n\nLothar Meggendorfer, All Alive. A Moveable Toybook (London: H. Grevel, c.\n1891).\n\nTo offer but a single example, compare the poem with the movable illustration\n\u201cGood Friends\u201d [above] in the British production All Alive, which featured\nrabbits, a goat, and a cat as a \u201chappy family,\u201d to the poem with movable\nillustration \u201cDie Heimkehr\u201d [below] in the original German version\nReiseabenteuer des Malers Daumenlang und seines Dieners Damian.\n\nLothar Meggendorfer, Reiseabenteuer des Malers Daumenlang und seines Dieners\nDamian. Ein Ziehbilderbuch (Esslingen: J. F. Schreiber, 1889).\n\nIn \u201cGood Friends,\u201d the ideal middle-class home was portrayed by domestic\nanimals \u201cliving in such harmony.\u201d Domestic animals continued to model\nappropriate behavior for bourgeois children in Meggendorfer\u2019s works. By\ncontrast, in \u201cDie Heimkehr,\u201d the young lord, Daumenlang, and his servant,\nDamian, have traveled the world, including Africa, and have headed for home\nloaded down with booty, including the skins of the tiger and black bear that\nthey had encountered and mastered, and live apes and birds. They found danger,\nbut not harmony, among exotic animals, which were perceived as part of the\nconquerable landscape of certain non-European territories. I first saw the\nillustration of the tiger \u201cattack\u201d from Reiseabenteuer in the Cotsen Library;\nthose pages have been excised in the late-twentieth-century reproduction of\nthe book.\n\nThe books by Lothar Meggendorfer that delighted audiences in the late\nnineteenth century and were embraced with enthusiasm in the late twentieth\ncentury were not simply examples of paper acrobatics. Rather, they both\nreflected and shaped the historical context of the expanding German empire at\nthe turn of the twentieth century.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * Pinterest9\n\n### Related\n\n#### Noah\u2019s Art: Designing Arks for Children\n\nNoah's Ark Toys For centuries the story of the flood in Genesis 6-9 has been\nan inspiration to toymakers.
