He not only shows the\ndevice working but also explains how he made it, using readily available\nmaterials and a code he programmed himself.\n\nHe claims he first trained an artificial intelligence (AI) model to\nspecifically recognise reggaeton songs. To do this, he downloaded\nrepresentative tracks of the genre and uploaded them to Edge Impulse, a\nmachine-learning development platform.\n\n> I understand that jamming a neighbour's speaker might be illegal, but on the\n> other hand listening to reggaeton every day at 9AM should definitely be\n> illegal.\n\nRoni Bandini\n\nProgrammer and artist\n\nOnce the AI was ready, it was time for the hardware. The programmer says he\nadded a 3D-printed front and a small OLED screen to a metal box. Inside, he\nput a Raspberry Pi 3 into which he loaded the AI model he had trained.\n\nTo detect the music, he added a microphone and wrote a Python code to monitor\nit and send the sounds to the recognition software.\n\nRoni Bandini and his Reggaeton Be Gone.Roni Bandini / Medium\n\n## So what happens if the machine detects reggaeton?\n\n\"If the inference exceeds a level of recognition, for example, 75% certainty\nthat it's my neighbour's preferred genre, the machine sends multiple requests\nand packets [via Bluetooth] to the speaker, for which I have the MAC address,\nin order to turn it off or at least jam the audio,\" Bandini explained in a\nvideo posted on social media.\n\nHis inspiration came from TV-B-Gone, a universal remote control launched in\n2004 capable of turning off TVs in public places such as shops, bars and\nwaiting rooms. It was created by Mitch Altman, a US hacker and inventor.\n\n\"I understand that jamming a neighbour's speaker might be illegal, but on the\nother hand listening to reggaeton every day at 9 AM should definitely be\nillegal,\" Bandini added in his social video.\n\nHis invention has gone viral, but he refuses to make a business out of it.\n\n\"I understand the huge commercial opportunity of making this equipment and\nselling it en masse, but as Bartleby said, 'I'd rather not',\" he wrote in a\npost on Medium.\n\nIf you're into programming and want to make your own [insert your most hated\ngenre of music] Be Gone, Bandini has also posted a step-by-step guide.\n\nShare this articleComments\n\n## You might also like\n\nNow playing Next\n\nCulture news\n\n### Does AI spell disaster for the music industry?\n\nNow playing Next\n\nCulture news\n\n### Live coding takes computer music on stage for France biggest algorave\n\nNow playing Next\n\nScenes\n\n### Meet the 15-year-old coding genius from Spain\n\nIN PARTNERSHIP WITH MEDIA CITY\n\ncoding Artificial intelligence machine learning Music\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n## Top stories\n\nNow playing Next\n\n## Europe may soon launch a new space law.
