To\nreplace artists, writers, programmers, support professionals, and other\ncontent professionals, AI must become an apprentice to these professionals. It\nmust learn from them. \u201cIt would be impossible to train today\u2019s leading AI\nmodels without using copyrighted materials,\u201d OpenAI admitted in its submission\nto the UK House of Lords. OpenAI aggressively stole other people\u2019s content\nwithout their permission because that\u2019s the way so many successful Silicon\nValley companies have built their businesses\u2014by stealing. At one stage, the\nOpenAI team transcribed, without permission, a million hours of videos on\nYouTube. Of course, Google, which owns YouTube and is a competitor of OpenAI,\nwas also busily transcribing videos without permission. That\u2019s the way Big\nTech rolls. It\u2019s Trumpian in its sense of immunity, arrogance and\nuntouchability. This sort of theft by tech companies is so common and endemic,\nit\u2019s taken as normal. In the tech world, the law is: \u2018Your copyright is mine\nto steal. Touch my copyright and I\u2019ll sue.\u2019 For Facebook, \u201cnegotiating\nlicenses with publishers, artists, musicians and the news industry would take\ntoo long,\u201d according to the New York Times, so they were willing to \u201ccut\ncorners\u201d and face lawsuits in the race to acquire content. AI cannot exist\nwithout stealing. So, would you be willing let a thief into your home? Would\nyou make a thief your best friend? Would you keep a thief in your pocket?\nBecause that is the moral landscape of AI. Designed by thieves for fools.\n\n\u201cThe only practical way for these tools to exist is if they can be trained on\nmassive amounts of data without having to license that data,\u201d Sy Damle, a\nlawyer representing Andreessen Horowitz, a heavy investor in AI, stated matter\nof factly. You know how tech companies are forever telling you that they care\nabout your privacy? Hah. Good joke. As the need to steal more and more content\naccelerated, Google wanted everything. It asked its privacy team to rewrite\nthe terms of service so that Google could do what Google needed to do. The\nteam dutifully complied, of course. Morals and ethics out the window\u2014again.\n\"The team was told specifically to release the new terms on the Fourth of July\nweekend, when people were typically focused on the holiday,\" the New York\nTimes reported.\n\nMorals matter. Character matters. In Silicon Valley, we have a culture that\nholds morals and character and ethics in contempt. Anything that gets in the\nway of the fast buck must be crushed. Those who challenge the acceleration\nfrenzy are enemies. If you let really bad, greedy people design AI, you get\nreally bad, greedy AI. AI that is born and bred on stolen data thinks stealing\nis natural, thinks it has every right to steal your data and to steal your\nrights.\n\nFollow Gerry on Mastodon\n\nSubscribe and get the weekly issue delivered by email. \u20ac10 for 48 issues a\nyear.\n\nRead more from Gerry\n\nPodcast: World Wide Waste Interviews with prominent thinkers outlining what\ncan be done to make digital as sustainable as possible.
