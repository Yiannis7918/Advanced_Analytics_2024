Either way, people were upset about it. We had that National Debt\nClock, which was installed on the side of a building in New York City in 1989.\nIn the 1992 election, the three candidates competed to portray themselves as\ndeficit cutters \u2014 and to be honest, all of them were being pretty honest. Bill\nClinton won, and the nation celebrated as his combination of spending cuts and\ntax hikes brought the nation back to a surplus by the end of the 1990s.\n\nWhy was the U.S. so austerity-minded in the early 1990s? The country had begun\nto run persistent budget deficits in the 70s, which had grown in the 80s as a\nresult of Reagan\u2019s tax cuts and defense buildup:\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the only reason. The government was also paying a fortune in\ninterest on the national debt every year. The Fed had raised interest rates in\nthe late 70s and early 80s to fight the inflation of the previous decade, and\nthese higher rates meant that the U.S. national debt was suddenly more of an\nannual burden:\n\nIn the years after Clinton\u2019s victory over deficits, the U.S. reversed course\nagain. The federal government went into the red during the Bush years, mainly\nbecause of tax cuts. Obama then unleashed a massive stimulus to fight the\nGreat Recession. With some pressure from the Tea Party Congress, Obama cut the\ndeficit somewhat in his second term, but Trump started raising it again. The\nCovid hit, and the U.S. did a massive amount of deficit spending to make sure\nit didn\u2019t wipe out Americans\u2019 finances.\n\nWhy was the U.S. so blas\u00e9 about big deficits in 2002-2020, when we had freaked\nout so much over comparatively modest deficits in the early 90s? Part of it\nwas that there were a bunch of emergencies that seemed to justify a temporary\nburst of deficit spending \u2014 9/11, the financial crisis and Great Recession,\nand Covid. But a lot of it was simply due to the fact that interest rates were\nreally low, so it was a lot easier for the government to carry a larger amount\nof debt. As you can see from the graph above, even though debt rose steadily\nin the 2000s and 2010s, interest payments stayed pretty low.\n\nBut over the last two years, something ominous has happened. Although the\npandemic is long over, the economy is doing great, and interest rates have\nrisen sharply, the U.S. federal government is still borrowing a ton of money.\nThe deficit was over 5% of GDP in 2022, and increased to over 6% of GDP in\n2023 \u2014 levels not seen since the Great Recession. Part of the increase from\n2022 to 2023 appears to have been a one-off, driven by a stock bust and some\nstrange timing of tax collections. But the 2022 deficit is still historically\nvery large as a percent of GDP.\n\nAnd it\u2019s starting to cost us. As the graph above shows, interest costs on the\ndebt are spiking \u2014 they\u2019re not yet back to early 1990s levels, but they\u2019re\nrising very fast.\n\nSo there are two questions here. First, why are we doing this? And second,\nwhen will this become a problem for our country? Unfortunately, there\u2019s a huge\namount of uncertainty around both of those questions, but it\u2019s not too hard to\ncome up with some scary theories.\n\n####\n\nWhat is the purpose of deficit spending in 2024?\n\n## Keep reading with a 7-day free trial\n\nSubscribe to Noahpinion to keep reading this post and get 7 days of free\naccess to the full post archives.\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
