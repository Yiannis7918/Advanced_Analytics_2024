They found that the\nadoption of industrial robots takes a mental toll on workers \u2013 more so for\nthose with repetitive jobs and less so for those with non-routine\nresponsibilities.\n\nAdd that to prior research showing robotic automation depresses wages and\nemployment.\n\nIn a paper titled \"Robots, meaning, and self-determination,\" appearing in the\njournal Research Policy, authors Milena Nikolova, Femke Cnossen, and Boris\nNikolaev observe that rapid technological advancement has sparked fears about\nthe impact of technology on jobs, and led to numerous academic studies.\n\nLess explored, they argue, is the non-monetary impact of automation and how\nworkers cope with it. So they chose to examine how industrial robots affect\nboth work meaningfulness \u2013 how workers see their labor as valuable,\nsignificant, or purposeful \u2013 and self-determination \u2013 the extent to which\nworkers experience autonomy, competence, and relatedness.\n\nIndustrial robot adoption, they note, can reduce human interactions to the\ndetriment of work relationships. It can also diminish the need for creative\nproblem solving, curtail learning opportunities, and limit skill utilization.\nAnd it can reduce worker autonomy if robots and algorithms decide on tasks and\ntheir execution.\n\nRobotic automation isn't necessarily harmful and may be positive, the authors\nobserve, pointing out that machines can eliminate the need to perform dull,\nrepetitive tasks. While adrenaline addicts might bemoan bomb disposal robots\nand space surgeons, there's a fairly good case for delegating that work to\nmachines.\n\nTo assess the non-monetary impact of robotic automation, the authors analyzed\nworker-level survey data from 20 European countries and 14 industries for the\nyears 2010, 2015, and 2021. They compared that with industry-level data on\nchanges in robots per 10,000 workers.\n\n  * Uber Eats to rid itself of pesky human drivers with food delivery by robo Waymo\n  * The Who's Who of AI just chipped in to fund humanoid robot startup Figure\n  * Boffins caution against allowing robots to run on AI models\n  * CERN is training robot dogs to spot radiation hazards at Large Hadron Collider\n\nWhat the authors found is that robots make workers feel worse \u2013 unless they\ncontrol the robots.\n\n\"Our key finding is that robots harm work meaningfulness and autonomy,\" wrote\nNikolova, Cnossen, and Nikolaev.\n\nSpecifically, doubling the presence of robots leads to a 0.9 percent decline\nin work meaningfulness and a 1 percent decline in autonomy.\n\n\"Across all industries in our sample, the average increase in robotization\nbetween 2005 and 2020 was 389 percent (almost a four-fold increase),\" they\nobserve.\n\nAnd in specific industries, robot adoption was far more advanced. The authors\npoint out that in mining and quarrying, there was a 26x increase over the same\ntime period, \"implying a substantial loss in meaningfulness and autonomy.\"\n\nThe automotive industry, they observe, has seen the most adoption of\nindustrial robots. And they suggest that were the food and beverage industry \u2013\nalready top five in robot uptake \u2013 to increase its robot use to match (a 7.5x\nincrease), food and beverage workers would see a 6.8 percent decline in work\nmeaningfulness and a 7.5 percent decline in autonomy.\n\nOne way to mitigate the loss of autonomy is to give workers control.\n\"Specifically, working with computers \u2013 being in control of the machine \u2013\ncompletely offsets the negative consequences of automation for autonomy,\" the\nauthors note, adding that education and skill also mitigates loss of autonomy.\n\nBut giving workers a computer control console doesn't counteract the sense of\ndiminished meaningfulness that accompanies robot adoption, the study suggests.\n\nThe authors conclude that understanding how automation affects the way people\nfeel about work is important for ensuring worker productivity and health, and\nfor minimizing turnover. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Automation\n  * Employment\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Automation\n  * Employment\n  * Robotics\n  * Software\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * AdBlock Plus\n  * App\n  * Application Delivery Controller\n  * Audacity\n  * Confluence\n  * Database\n  * Employment Tribunal\n  * FOSDEM\n  * FOSS\n  * Freelancing\n  * Gemini\n  * Google AI\n  * GPT-3\n  * GPT-4\n  * Grab\n  * Graphics Interchange Format\n  * IDE\n  * Jenkins\n  * Job cuts\n  * Large Language Model\n  * Layoff\n  * Legacy Technology\n  * LibreOffice\n  * Machine Learning\n  * Map\n  * MCubed\n  * Microsoft 365\n  * Microsoft Office\n  * Microsoft Teams\n  * Mobile Device Management\n  * Neural Networks\n  * NLP\n  * OpenOffice\n  * Programming Language\n  * QR code\n  * Retro computing\n  * Search Engine\n  * Software bug\n  * Software License\n  * Star Wars\n  * Tensor Processing Unit\n  * Text Editor\n  * Trade Union\n  * Umbrella Firm\n  * User interface\n  * Visual Studio\n  * Visual Studio Code\n  * WebAssembly\n  * Web Browser\n  * WordPress\n  * Working from Home\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Self-driving Car\n\n#### More about\n\n5 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Automation\n  * Employment\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Automation\n  * Employment\n  * Robotics\n  * Software\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * AdBlock Plus\n  * App\n  * Application Delivery Controller\n  * Audacity\n  * Confluence\n  * Database\n  * Employment Tribunal\n  * FOSDEM\n  * FOSS\n  * Freelancing\n  * Gemini\n  * Google AI\n  * GPT-3\n  * GPT-4\n  * Grab\n  * Graphics Interchange Format\n  * IDE\n  * Jenkins\n  * Job cuts\n  * Large Language Model\n  * Layoff\n  * Legacy Technology\n  * LibreOffice\n  * Machine Learning\n  * Map\n  * MCubed\n  * Microsoft 365\n  * Microsoft Office\n  * Microsoft Teams\n  * Mobile Device Management\n  * Neural Networks\n  * NLP\n  * OpenOffice\n  * Programming Language\n  * QR code\n  * Retro computing\n  * Search Engine\n  * Software bug\n  * Software License\n  * Star Wars\n  * Tensor Processing Unit\n  * Text Editor\n  * Trade Union\n  * Umbrella Firm\n  * User interface\n  * Visual Studio\n  * Visual Studio Code\n  * WebAssembly\n  * Web Browser\n  * WordPress\n  * Working from Home\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Self-driving Car\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Microsoft rolls out safety tools for Azure AI.
