Appropriate reactions can be derived from this analysis. The model\nhas nine stages \u2013 in contrast to the earlier model of Kurt R. Spillmann,^[1]\nwhich describes five distinct stages of escalation. These stages are grouped\ninto three levels, which each contain three stages.\n\n## Levels[edit]\n\nGlasl represents \"escalation in his nine stage model not as an ascent to\nhigher and higher stages of escalation, but as a descent to deeper and deeper,\nmore primitive and more inhuman forms of dispute... [which] inevitably leads\ninto regions that evoke great 'inhuman energies' which are not ultimately\namenable to human control or restraint.\"^[2] In the first level both parties\ncan still win (win\u2013win). In the second level one of the parties loses and the\nother wins (win\u2013lose), and in the third level both parties lose (lose\u2013lose).\n\nThe nine stages of conflict escalation\n\nMany different kinds of conflict can be thus analysed: divorces, conflicts\nbetween colleagues and school children, and also conflicts between states.\n\n### 1st Level (Win\u2013Win)[edit]\n\nStage 1 \u2013 Tension\n\n    Conflicts start with tensions, e.g. the occasional clash of opinions. This is a common occurrence and is not perceived as the start of a conflict. However, if a conflict should result the positions become more fundamental. The conflict could have deeper causes.\nStage 2 \u2013 Debate\n\n    From now on the conflict parties consider strategies to convince the counterparty of their arguments. Differences of opinion lead to a dispute. The parties try to put each other under pressure and think in terms of black and white.\nStage 3 \u2013 Actions instead of words\n\n    The conflict parties increase the pressure on each other in order to assert their own opinion. Discussions are broken off. No more verbal communication takes place and the conflict is increasingly exacerbated. Sympathy for \"them\" disappears.\n\n### 2nd Level (Win\u2013Lose)[edit]\n\nStage 4 \u2013 Coalitions\n\n    The conflict is exacerbated by the search for sympathisers for one's cause. Believing one has right on one's side, one can denounce the opponent. The issue is no longer important: one has to win the conflict so that the opponent loses.\nStage 5 \u2013 Loss of face\n\n    The opponent is to be denigrated by innuendo and the like. The loss of trust is complete. Loss of face means in this sense the loss of moral credibility.\nStage 6 \u2013 Threat strategies\n\n    The conflict parties try to gain absolute control by issuing threats which demonstrate their own power. One threatens, for example, with a demand (10 million euros) which is enforced by a sanction (\"otherwise I\u2032ll blow up your main building\") and underlined by the potential for sanction (showing the explosive). The proportions decide the credibility of the threat.\n\n### 3rd Level (Lose\u2013Lose)[edit]\n\nStage 7 \u2013 Limited destruction\n\n    One tries to severely damage the opponent with all the tricks at one's disposal. The opponent is no longer regarded as human. From now on, limited personal loss is seen as a gain if the damage to the opponent is greater.\nStage 8 \u2013 Total annihilation\n\n    The opponent is to be annihilated by all means.\nStage 9 \u2013 Together into the abyss\n\n    From this point personal annihilation is accepted in order to defeat the opponent.\n\n## Strategies for de-escalation and conflict solution[edit]\n\nThe model describes how two parties in a conflict behave. Solutions leading to\nde-escalation are not immediately apparent in this model,^[3] particularly\nwhen it appears to both conflict parties impossible to reverse the situation\n(e.g. an aggressive act on the territory of a state, separation of a common\nchild from the other parent, withdrawal of nationality by a state, mass\nredundancy to improve shareholder value), or when one party selects conflict\nescalation as a strategic ploy.\n\nTo achieve de-escalation Glasl assigns the following strategic models to the\ndifferent stages of escalation:\n\n  * Stage 1\u20133: mediation\n  * Stage 3\u20135: process guidance\n  * Stage 4\u20136: sociotherapeutic process guidance\n  * Stage 5\u20137: intercession, intermediation\n  * Stage 6\u20138: arbitration, court action\n  * Stage 7\u20139: forcible intervention\n\nThe ability to recognise and eliminate conflict-nourishing forces in a\nculturally neutral and non-judgemental fashion in order to de-escalate a\nconflict is highly advantageous in particular for managers, consultants and\nsocial workers.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Business ethics\n  * Charles E.
