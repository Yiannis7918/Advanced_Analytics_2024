On the other hand, the Hawking radiation can be stimulated in\na classical process. The boundary of a sonic black hole, at which the flow\nspeed changes from being greater than the speed of sound to less than the\nspeed of sound, is called the event horizon.\n\n## History of the concept[edit]\n\nAcoustic black holes were first theorized to be useful by William Unruh in\n1981.^[3] However, the first black hole analogue was not created in a\nlaboratory until 2009. It was created in a rubidium Bose\u2013Einstein condensate\nusing a technique called density inversion. This technique creates a flow by\nrepelling the condensate with a potential minimum. The surface gravity and\ntemperature of the sonic black hole were measured, but no attempt was made to\ndetect Hawking radiation. However, the scientists who created it predicted\nthat the experiment was suitable for detection and suggested a method by which\nit might be done by lasing the phonons.^[4] In 2014, stimulated Hawking\nradiation was reported in an analogue black-hole laser by the same\nresearchers.^[2] Quantum, spontaneous Hawking radiation was observed\nlater.^[5]^[6]^[7]\n\nA rotating sonic black hole was used in 2010 to give the first laboratory\ntesting of superradiance, a process whereby energy is extracted from a black\nhole.^[8]\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\n### Perfect fluids[edit]\n\nSonic black holes are possible because phonons in perfect fluids exhibit the\nsame properties of motion as fields, such as gravity, in space and time.^[1]\nFor this reason, a system in which a sonic black hole can be created is called\na gravity analogue. Nearly any fluid can be used to create an acoustic event\nhorizon, but the viscosity of most fluids creates random motion^[citation\nneeded] that makes features like Hawking radiation nearly impossible to\ndetect. The complexity of such a system would make it very difficult to gain\nany knowledge about such features even if they could be detected.^[9] Many\nnearly perfect fluids have been suggested for use in creating sonic black\nholes, such as superfluid helium, one\u2013dimensional degenerate Fermi gases, and\nBose\u2013Einstein condensate. Gravity analogues other than phonons in a fluid,\nsuch as slow light and a system of ions, have also been proposed for studying\nblack hole analogues.^[10] The fact that so many systems mimic gravity is\nsometimes used as evidence for the theory of emergent gravity, which could\nhelp reconcile relativity, and quantum mechanics.^[11]\n\n### Acoustic engineering[edit]\n\nIn addition to the above-mentioned sonic or acoustic black holes that can be\nviewed as analogues of astrophysical black holes, physical objects bearing the\nsame names also exist in Acoustic and Vibration Engineering, where they are\nused for sound absorption and for damping structural vibrations.^[12] The\nAcoustic Black Hole effect in such objects can be achieved by creating a\ngradual reduction of sound velocity in a waveguide or elastic wave velocity in\na solid structure (e.g. flexural wave velocity in thin plates) with\npropagation distance. The required velocity reduction should follow a power-\nlaw function of the propagation distance, and the velocity at the end of the\nwave propagation path should be reduced to almost zero. Also, measures should\nbe taken to insert a small amount of traditional sound or vibration absorbing\nmaterials in the area of very low propagation velocity. Under these\nconditions, the described sonic or acoustic black holes provide almost 100%\nabsorption of the incident air-borne or structure-borne acoustic waves.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Acoustic metric\n  * Analog models of gravity\n  * Black hole\n  * Optical black hole\n  * Quantum gravity\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b Visser, Matt (1998). \"Acoustic black holes: Horizons, ergospheres and Hawking radiation\".
