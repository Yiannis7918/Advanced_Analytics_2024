Researchers identified significant associations between ALS risk and\nthe residential storage of volatile chemicals such as pesticides, gasoline,\nand paint.\n\nThe study\u2019s findings underscore the importance of the \u201cALS exposome\u201d\u2014a concept\ndescribing the cumulative exposure to environmental toxins linked to ALS.\nInsights from the study suggest interventions to minimize exposure and\npotentially reduce ALS risk by modifying storage practices in homes.\n\nKey Facts:\n\n  1. The study surveyed over 600 participants and found that storing volatile chemicals in attached garages was significantly associated with ALS risk.\n  2. Chemicals linked to ALS included gasoline, lawn care products, and woodworking supplies, with most participants reporting storage in attached garages.\n  3. Airflow from attached garages into living spaces may explain the heightened risk, pointing to the need for building codes that minimize such exposures.\n\nSource: University of Michigan\n\nOver the last decade, researchers at University of Michigan continue to find\nthat exposure to environmental toxins \u2014 from pesticides used in agriculture to\nvolatile organic compounds in the manufacturing industry \u2014 is linked to the\ndevelopment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS.\n\nThe buildup of exposures, which researchers call the ALS exposome, is possibly\nassociated with recreational activities such as woodworking and gardening.\n\nNow, a Michigan Medicine study finds that storing chemicals in a garage at\nhome may associate with an increased risk of ALS.\n\nThe results are published in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal\nDegeneration.\n\n\u201cIdentifying disease-provoking exposures can inform and motivate interventions\nto reduce exposure, risk and, ultimately, the ALS burden,\u201d said first author\nStephen Goutman, M.D., M.S., director of the Pranger ALS Clinic and associate\ndirector of the ALS Center of Excellence at University of Michigan.\n\n\u201cExposures in the home setting are an important part of the ALS exposome, as\nit is one place where behavior modifications could possibly lessen ALS risk.\u201d\n\nStorage containing volatile chemicals in garages is extremely common, whether\nit\u2019s in a car or motorcycle, equipment like a chainsaw, or solvents, cleaners,\npaints and other items.\n\nInvestigators assessed exposures in the residential setting from a survey of\nmore than 600 participants both with and without ALS. Through statistical\nanalysis, they found that the storage of chemicals \u2014 including gasoline and\ngasoline powered equipment, lawn care products, pesticides, paint and\nwoodworking supplies \u2014 were significantly associated with ALS risk.\n\nAll of the reported chemicals linked to disease development were volatile with\ntoxic components. Most participants reported storing several of the items in\ntheir attached garage.\n\nStoring chemicals in a detached garage, however, did not show as strong of an\nassociation with risk.\n\nResearchers say the flow of air and airborne pollutants from attached garages\nto the living space may explain the finding.\n\n\u201cEspecially in colder climates, air in the garage tends to rush into the house\nwhen the entry door is opened, and air flows occur more or less continuously\nthrough small cracks and openings in walls and floors,\u201d said Stuart Batterman,\nPh.D., senior author and professor of environmental health science at the U-M\nSchool of Public Health.\n\n\u201cThus, it makes sense that keeping volatile chemicals in an attached garage\nshows the stronger effect.\u201d\n\nThe latest building codes, Batterman notes, tackle this problem by specifying\nmeasures to reduce or eliminate these air flows.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to see risk factors across multiple settings that may\nassociate with a greater ALS risk; we also see some relationships across the\nstudies, for example, woodworking and woodworking supplies and gardening and\nlawn care supplies,\u201d Goutman said.\n\n\u201cThis begs the question: is it the activities that associate with ALS risk or\nthe exposures to related products? This requires further research.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, the research team found that people with ALS had higher\nconcentrations of pesticides in their blood compared to people without the\ncondition.\n\nA subsequent study published in 2019 linked organochlorine pesticides and\npolychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBS, to worsening survival for ALS.\n\n\u201cWith each study, we better understand the types of exposures that increase\nthe risk of developing ALS,\u201d said senior author Eva Feldman, M.D., Ph.D.,\ndirector of the ALS Center of Excellence at U-M and James W. Albers\nDistinguished University Professor at U-M.\n\n\u201cWe now need to build on these discoveries to understand how these exposures\nincrease ALS risk. In parallel, we must continue to advocate to make ALS a\nreportable disease. Only then we will fully understand the array of exposures\nthat increase disease risk.\u201d\n\nStudies to understand how environmental exposures contribute to the\ndevelopment of ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases, both of people with\nand without family history of the condition, are underway.\n\nAdditional authors: Include Jonathan Boss, Ph.D., Dae Gyu Jang, Ph.D.,\nCaroline Piecuch, Hasan Farid, Madeleine Batra, Bhramar Mukherjee, Ph.D all of\nUniversity of Michigan.\n\nFunding: This study was supported by the National Institutes of Health, The\nNational ALS Registry/CDC/ATSDR, the ALS Association, the NeuroNetwork for\nEmerging Therapies, the Robert and Katherine Jacobs Environmental Health\nInitiative, the NeuroNetwork Therapeutic Discovery Fund, the Peter R.

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Degeneration\n\nAbstract\n\nResidential exposure associations with ALS risk, survival, and phenotype: a\nMichigan-based case-control study\n\nBackground: Environmental exposures impact amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)\nrisk and progression, a fatal and progressive neurodegenerative disease.\nBetter characterization of these exposures is needed to decrease disease\nburden.\n\nObjective: To identify exposures in the residential setting that associate\nwith ALS risk, survival, and onset segment.\n\nMethods: ALS and control participants recruited from University of Michigan\ncompleted a survey that ascertained exposure risks in the residential setting.\nALS risk was assessed using logistic regression models followed by latent\nprofile analysis to consider exposure profiles. A case-only analysis\nconsidered the contribution of the residential exposure variables via a Cox\nproportional hazards model for survival outcomes and multinomial logistic\nregression for onset segment, a polytomous outcome.\n\nResults: This study included 367 ALS and 255 control participants. Twelve\nresidential variables were associated with ALS risk after correcting for\nmultiple comparison testing, with storage in an attached garage of chemical\nproducts including gasoline or kerosene (odds ratio (OR) = 1.14, p_adjusted <\n0.001), gasoline-powered equipment (OR = 1.16, p_adjusted < 0.001), and lawn\ncare products (OR = 1.15, p_adjusted < 0.001) representing the top three risk\nfactors sorted by adjusted.\n\nLatent profile analysis indicated that storage of these chemical products in\nboth attached and detached garages increased ALS risk. Although residential\nvariables were not associated with poorer ALS survival following multiple\ntesting corrections, storing pesticides, lawn care products, and woodworking\nsupplies in the home were associated with shorter ALS survival using nominal p\nvalues. No exposures were associated with ALS onset segment.\n\nConclusion: Residential exposures may be important modifiable components of\nthe ALS susceptibility and prognosis exposome.\n\nTags\n\namyotrophic lateral sclerosisbrain researchenvironmental\nneuroscienceneurobiologyNeurologyNeurosciencepesticidesUniversity of Michigan\n\nShareTweetShareShareSubmitEmail\n\nNeuroscience News\n\nNeuroscience News posts science research news from labs, universities,\nhospitals and news departments around the world.
