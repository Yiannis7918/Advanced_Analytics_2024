On Friday night (April 19), the rapper released a song\non his social media entitled \u201cTaylor Made Freestyle,\u201d which uses AI vocals\nfrom Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg on a stopgap between diss records as he\nawaits Kendrick Lamar\u2019s reply to his freshly released \u201cPush Ups.\u201d\n\nOn the track, an imagined Shakur speaks directly to Lamar and addresses his\nsilence since releasing his verse on \u201cLike That,\u201d a diss that started off this\nfeud last month. \u201cKendrick we need ya, the West Coast savior / Engraving your\nname in some hip-hop history,\u201d raps an artificial Shakur. \u201cCall him a bitch\nfor me / Talk about him liking young girls as a gift for me.\u201d\n\n## Related Stories\n\nVIP+\n\n### \u2018Civil War\u2019 Record Opening Leaves A24 With More to Prove\n\n### 30 Highest Rated Movies of all Time: Movies With 100% on Rotten Tomatoes\n\nDrake continues by using Snoop Dogg\u2019s computer-generated vocals to speak\ndirectly to Lamar. \u201cWorld is watching this chess game, but oh you out of moves\nDot / You know that the OG never fucking doubted you / But right now it seem\nlike you posted up without a clue / Or what the fuck you \u2019bout to do.\u201d\n\n### Popular on Variety\n\n1/1 Skip Ad Continue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE\n\nMany have conjectured that Drake rapped the Shakur and Snoop Dogg verses and\nused AI to manipulate how they sound. But Drake comes in with his own verse at\nthe end of the song, stating that it\u2019s a stopgap until he gets a response from\nLamar. \u201cThe first one really only took me an hour or two / The next one is\nreally \u2019bout to bring out the coward in you,\u201d he states. On Instagram, where\nhe posted the song, he wrote, \u201cWhile we wait on you I guess.\u201d\n\nHe also suggests that Lamar is sitting on his response track due to the\noverwhelming cultural moment surrounding Taylor Swift\u2019s new album \u201cThe\nTortured Poets Department,\u201d and how everything else will be eclipsed by its\nexistence. \u201cBut now we gotta wait a fucking week \u2019cause Taylor Swift is your\nnew Top,\u201d he states, referencing Lamar\u2019s former record label Top Dawg\nEntertainment. \u201cAnd if you \u2019bout to drop, she gotta approve / This girl really\n\u2019bout to make you act like you not in a feud.\u201d\n\nAll of this started when Lamar contributed a surprise verse to Future and\nMetro Boomin\u2019s \u201cLike That,\u201d a song included on their joint album \u201cWe Don\u2019t\nTrust You.\u201d Lamar took issue with J. Cole including him in \u201cthe big three\u201d on\n\u201cFirst Person Shooter,\u201d a collaboration between Cole and Drake on the latter\u2019s\n2023 album \u201cFor All the Dogs.\u201d\n\nIn the time since, it\u2019s been a free-for-all in the upper elechons of hip-hop,\nwith J. Cole responding to Lamar on \u201c7 Minute Drill,\u201d a song included on his\nsurprise release project \u201cMight Delete Later.\u201d On the track, Cole attempted to\ndiscredit Lamar\u2019s discography, but quickly retracted and removed the song from\nstreaming platforms.\n\nDrake released his own diss track last weekend entitled \u201cPush Ups.\u201d It\ninitially leaked as an unfinished demo, shortly followed by a studio version.\nHe officially dropped the song on streaming services today (April 19).\n\nComments\n\nWant to read more articles like this one?\n\nSubscribe Today\n\n## More From Variety\n\n### 30 Highest Rated Movies of all Time: Movies With 100% on Rotten Tomatoes\n\n### \u2018Civil War\u2019 Record Opening Leaves A24 With More to Prove\n\n### \u2018She-Hulk\u2019 Star Tatiana Maslany Was \u2018So Heated Up\u2019 When She Called Disney\nCEO Bob Iger \u2018Out of Touch\u2019 During the Strike: \u2018It\u2019s Hard to Articulate\nYourself\u2019 on the Picket Line\n\n### \u2018SNL\u2019 Star Kenan Thompson on How He Kept a Straight Face During \u2018Beavis\nand Butt-Head\u2019 Sketch After Losing It in Rehearsal: \u2018I Started to Panic\u2019\n\n### Apple Vision Pro + Entertainment: A Special Report\n\n### New \u2018The Office\u2019 Series Adds Sabrina Impacciatore, Domhnall Gleeson to\nCast\n\nLoading comments...\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nComments are moderated.
