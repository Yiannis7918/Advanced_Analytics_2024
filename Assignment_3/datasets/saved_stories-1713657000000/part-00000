For the\ninvesting term named after Benjamin Graham, see Graham number.\n\nGraham's number is an immense number that arose as an upper bound on the\nanswer of a problem in the mathematical field of Ramsey theory. It is much\nlarger than many other large numbers such as Skewes's number and Moser's\nnumber, both of which are in turn much larger than a googolplex. As with\nthese, it is so large that the observable universe is far too small to contain\nan ordinary digital representation of Graham's number, assuming that each\ndigit occupies one Planck volume, possibly the smallest measurable space. But\neven the number of digits in this digital representation of Graham's number\nwould itself be a number so large that its digital representation cannot be\nrepresented in the observable universe. Nor even can the number of digits of\nthat number\u2014and so forth, for a number of times far exceeding the total number\nof Planck volumes in the observable universe. Thus Graham's number cannot be\nexpressed even by physical universe-scale power towers of the form .\n\nHowever, Graham's number can be explicitly given by computable recursive\nformulas using Knuth's up-arrow notation or equivalent, as was done by Ronald\nGraham, the number's namesake. As there is a recursive formula to define it,\nit is much smaller than typical busy beaver numbers, the latter of which grow\nfaster than any computable sequence. Though too large to ever be computed in\nfull, the sequence of digits of Graham's number can be computed explicitly via\nsimple algorithms; the last 13 digits are ...7262464195387. Using Knuth's up-\narrow notation, Graham's number is ,^[1] where\n\nGraham's number was used by Graham in conversations with popular science\nwriter Martin Gardner as a simplified explanation of the upper bounds of the\nproblem he was working on. In 1977, Gardner described the number in Scientific\nAmerican, introducing it to the general public. At the time of its\nintroduction, it was the largest specific positive integer ever to have been\nused in a published mathematical proof. The number was described in the 1980\nGuinness Book of World Records, adding to its popular interest. Other specific\nintegers (such as TREE(3)) known to be far larger than Graham's number have\nsince appeared in many serious mathematical proofs, for example in connection\nwith Harvey Friedman's various finite forms of Kruskal's theorem.\nAdditionally, smaller upper bounds on the Ramsey theory problem from which\nGraham's number was derived have since been proven to be valid.\n\n## Context[edit]\n\nExample of a 2-colored 3-dimensional cube containing one single-coloured\n4-vertex coplanar complete subgraph. The subgraph is shown below the cube.\nThis cube would contain no such subgraph if, for example, the bottom edge in\nthe present subgraph were replaced by a blue edge \u2013 thus proving by\ncounterexample that N* > 3.\n\nGraham's number is connected to the following problem in Ramsey theory:\n\n> Connect each pair of geometric vertices of an n-dimensional hypercube to\n> obtain a complete graph on 2^n vertices. Colour each of the edges of this\n> graph either red or blue. What is the smallest value of n for which every\n> such colouring contains at least one single-coloured complete subgraph on\n> four coplanar vertices?\n\nIn 1971, Graham and Rothschild proved the Graham\u2013Rothschild theorem on the\nRamsey theory of parameter words, a special case of which shows that this\nproblem has a solution N*. They bounded the value of N* by 6 \u2264 N* \u2264 N, with N\nbeing a large but explicitly defined number\n\nwhere in Knuth's up-arrow notation; the number is between 4 \u2192 2 \u2192 8 \u2192 2 and 2\n\u2192 3 \u2192 9 \u2192 2 in Conway chained arrow notation.^[2] This was reduced in 2014 via\nupper bounds on the Hales\u2013Jewett number to\n\nwhich contains three tetrations.^[3] In 2019 this was further improved to:^[4]\n\nThe lower bound of 6 was later improved to 11 by Geoffrey Exoo in 2003,^[5]\nand to 13 by Jerome Barkley in 2008.^[6] Thus, the best known bounds for N*\nare 13 \u2264 N* \u2264 N''.\n\nGraham's number, G, is much larger than N: , where . This weaker upper bound\nfor the problem, attributed to an unpublished work of Graham, was eventually\npublished and named by Martin Gardner in Scientific American in November\n1977.^[7]\n\n## Publication[edit]\n\nThe number gained a degree of popular attention when Martin Gardner described\nit in the \"Mathematical Games\" section of Scientific American in November\n1977, writing that Graham had recently established, in an unpublished proof,\n\"a bound so vast that it holds the record for the largest number ever used in\na serious mathematical proof.\" The 1980 Guinness Book of World Records\nrepeated Gardner's claim, adding to the popular interest in this number.\nAccording to physicist John Baez, Graham invented the quantity now known as\nGraham's number in conversation with Gardner. While Graham was trying to\nexplain a result in Ramsey theory which he had derived with his collaborator\nBruce Lee Rothschild, Graham found that the said quantity was easier to\nexplain than the actual number appearing in the proof. Because the number\nwhich Graham described to Gardner is larger than the number in the paper\nitself, both are valid upper bounds for the solution to the problem studied by\nGraham and Rothschild.^[8]\n\n## Definition[edit]\n\nUsing Knuth's up-arrow notation, Graham's number G (as defined in Gardner's\nScientific American article) is\n\nwhere the number of arrows in each layer is specified by the value of the next\nlayer below it; that is,\n\nwhere\n\nand where a superscript on an up-arrow indicates how many arrows there are. In\nother words, G is calculated in 64 steps: the first step is to calculate g_1\nwith four up-arrows between 3s; the second step is to calculate g_2 with g_1\nup-arrows between 3s; the third step is to calculate g_3 with g_2 up-arrows\nbetween 3s; and so on, until finally calculating G = g_64 with g_63 up-arrows\nbetween 3s.\n\nEquivalently,\n\nand the superscript on f indicates an iteration of the function, e.g., .\nExpressed in terms of the family of hyperoperations , the function f is the\nparticular sequence , which is a version of the rapidly growing Ackermann\nfunction A(n, n). (In fact, for all n.) The function f can also be expressed\nin Conway chained arrow notation as , and this notation also provides the\nfollowing bounds on G:\n\n### Magnitude[edit]\n\nTo convey the difficulty of appreciating the enormous size of Graham's number,\nit may be helpful to express\u2014in terms of exponentiation alone\u2014just the first\nterm (g_1) of the rapidly growing 64-term sequence. First, in terms of\ntetration () alone:\n\nwhere the number of 3s in the expression on the right is\n\nNow each tetration () operation reduces to a power tower () according to the\ndefinition\n\nwhere there are X 3s.\n\nThus,\n\nbecomes, solely in terms of repeated \"exponentiation towers\",\n\nand where the number of 3s in each tower, starting from the leftmost tower, is\nspecified by the value of the next tower to the right.\n\nIn other words, g_1 is computed by first calculating the number of towers,\n(where the number of 3s is ), and then computing the n^th tower in the\nfollowing sequence:\n\n    \n    \n    1st tower: 3 2nd tower: 3\u21913\u21913 (number of 3s is 3) = 7625597484987 3rd tower: 3\u21913\u21913\u21913\u2191...\u21913 (number of 3s is 7625597484987) = ... \u22ee g_1 = n^th tower: 3\u21913\u21913\u21913\u21913\u21913\u21913\u2191...\u21913 (number of 3s is given by the n \u2212 1^th tower)\n\nwhere the number of 3s in each successive tower is given by the tower just\nbefore it. The result of calculating the third tower is the value of n, the\nnumber of towers for g_1.\n\nThe magnitude of this first term, g_1, is so large that it is practically\nincomprehensible, even though the above display is relatively easy to\ncomprehend. Even n, the mere number of towers in this formula for g_1, is far\ngreater than the number of Planck volumes (roughly 10^185 of them) into which\none can imagine subdividing the observable universe. And after this first\nterm, still another 63 terms remain in the rapidly growing g sequence before\nGraham's number G = g_64 is reached. To illustrate just how fast this sequence\ngrows, while g_1 is equal to with only four up arrows, the number of up arrows\nin g_2 is this incomprehensibly large number g_1.\n\n## Rightmost decimal digits[edit]\n\nGraham's number, , is a \"power tower\" of the form (with an extremely large\nvalue of ), so its rightmost decimal digits are stable digits (for a proof,\nsee Lemma 1 of Reference^[9]), and thus they are the same of the rightmost\ndigits of the -adic fixed point of . This follows from a peculiar property of\ntetration which is called \"the constancy of the congruence speed\"^[10] so that\nall such towers of height greater than (say) are characterized by the same\nsequence of rightmost decimal digits (i.e., has exactly stable digits since ,\nbut is not congruent modulo to ).\n\nThis is a special case of the above-mentioned general property.^[11]\n\nThe following table illustrates, for a few values of , how this happens. For a\ngiven height of tower and number of digits , the full range of -digit numbers\n( of them) does not occur; instead, a certain smaller subset of values repeats\nitself in a cycle. The length of the cycle and some of the values (in\nparentheses) are shown in each cell of this table:\n\nNumber of different possible values of 3\u21913\u21913\u2191x when all but the rightmost d\ndecimal digits are ignoredNumber of digits (d)| 3\u2191x| 3\u21913\u2191x| 3\u21913\u21913\u2191x|\n3\u21913\u21913\u21913\u2191x| 3\u21913\u21913\u21913\u21913\u2191x  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n1| 4 (1,3,9,7)| 2 (3,7)| 1 (7)  \n2| 20 (01,03,...,87,...,67)| 4 (03,27,83,87)| 2 (27,87)| 1 (87)  \n3| 100 (001,003,...,387,...,667)| 20 (003,027,...387,...,587)| 4\n(027,987,227,387)| 2 (987,387)| 1 (387)  \n  \nThe particular rightmost digits that are ultimately shared by all sufficiently\ntall towers of s are in bold text, and can be seen developing as the tower\nheight increases. For any fixed number of digits (row in the table), the\nnumber of values possible for , as ranges over all nonnegative integers, is\nseen to decrease steadily as the height increases, until eventually reducing\nthe \"possibility set\" to a single number (colored cells) when the height\nexceeds .\n\nA simple algorithm^[12] for computing these digits may be described as\nfollows: let , then iterate, times, the assignment . Except for omitting any\nleading s, the final value assigned to (as a base-ten numeral) is then\ncomposed of the rightmost decimal digits of , for all . (If the final value of\nhas fewer than digits, then the required number of leading s must be added.)\n\nThe numerousness of these stable digits is (exactly) since , which\nconsequently satisfies the congruence relation\n\n(whereas is not congruent modulo to ).^[13] In detail, we have that since ,\nwhere indicates the super-logarithm.\n\nThe algorithm above produces the following rightmost decimal digits of\nGraham's number (OEIS: A133613):\n\n    \n    \n    ...02425950695064738395657479136519351798334535362521 43003540126026771622672160419810652263169355188780 38814483140652526168785095552646051071172000997092 91249544378887496062882911725063001303622934916080 25459461494578871427832350829242102091825896753560 43086993801689249889268099510169055919951195027887 17830837018340236474548882222161573228010132974509 27344594504343300901096928025352751833289884461508 94042482650181938515625357963996189939679054966380 03222348723967018485186439059104575627262464195387\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"Graham's Number\".\n  2. ^ \"Graham's number records\".
