Because the majority of my reasons\ncome from being in their Discord, which tons of average users will never\nreally look at, and I suspect a lot of Kagi supporters do not know a lot of\nthis backstory. This isn't a heavily researched deep dive or anything, I feel\nlike I always need these kind of disclaimers when I'm just posting my thoughts\nabout something backed up with my reasons for thinking it...it's just a quick\nrundown of why I personally went from a Kagi subscriber to a Kagi Naysayer, so\nthat I can have my reasons in one place that I can link others to. And I have\nseen a lot of people recommend Kagi that I personally know would be a lot less\ninterested in doing so if they knew this information, but they don't because\nit's not readily apparent just from using the site.\n\nFor those unfamiliar to start with, Kagi is a paid search engine that\npurportedly focuses on privacy. It's meant to be a no-nonsense platform\nfocused on being the best search it can be. Frankly, I think at this point\nit's a very nonsense-focused platform that has an extremely disinterested view\nof privacy, and I think it's not a particularly sustainable project either.\n\nFirst of all, as a project, Kagi stretches itself way too thin. \"Kagi\" isn't\njust Kagi Search, it's also a whole slew of AI tools, a Mac-only web browser\ncalled Orion, and right now they are planning on launching an email service as\nwell. None of these projects are particularly profitable, so it's not a case\nof one subsidizing the other, and when they announced Kagi Email even their\nmost dedicated userbase (aka the types who hang around in a discord for a\nsearch engine) seemed largely disinterested. For products this niche, I don't\nthink you can afford to be running multiple niche products at once. Your\ndevelopers are going to be running far too ragged to keep them all going. Last\nI could find Kagi employs about 16 employees, half full time. Presumably not\nevery single one of those 8 or so full timers are web devs. That's not a lot\nof people to throw at this many things.\n\nOh and they own a t-shirt factory.\n\nYou see, when Kagi had a funding round and raised about $670k. This funding\ncame from an investment round including \"42 accredited investors, most of whom\nare actual Kagi users\". Unfortunately unlike Cohost I can't give any kind of\nhuge financial breakdown here, because Kagi's finances are even less\ntransparent. If there are Kagi financial reports, I haven't seen them, just\nthe occasional Discord comment from Kagi employees. A while back they raised\ntheir prices, which lost them a lot of subscribers, because they were losing\nmoney per search at the old prices. They were actually still losing money per\nsearch on the new prices. They eventually lowered the prices back down a bit\n(and maybe raised them again? I've completely lost the plot on their pricing\nat this point) and have claimed that at 25,000 users they would be breaking\neven. I am unsure what happened in all of this for this math to be true, but\nmy point is that they did in fact reach at least 20,000 users, and to\ncelebrate they set up a business entity in Germany (they are currently US\nbased), in order to start a tiny little t-shirt printing company. And their\ngoal was to print 20,000 t-shirts to give out, FOR FREE, to their first 20,000\nusers (with users paying only shipping costs). But I cannot stress enough,\nthey did not just spend money on 20,000 tshirts to give out, they set up a\nwhole new business entity in Germany to run their own t-shirt printing\noperation, with its own building and warehouse and employee(s? I get the sense\nit's one guy but I don't know). And this cost them 1/3 of their $670k funding\nround. One, fucking, third. For t-shirts. Did I mention that the t-shirts\ndon't even have the Kagi name on them? Just the Kagi dog mascot, who is at\nthis point the only thing I like about Kagi, to the point where if I wasn't\nworried people would try to talk to me about Kagi I'd opt for one of the\nshirts myself. Great artist, whoever did this. Terrible financial choice to\nstart a whole t-shirt business to make 20,000 free t-shirts that do not even\nget your name out there.\n\nT-shirt companies aside, there's one other thing about Kagi's finances that\nwas revealed recently in an update stream they did that caught my attention--\nKagi was not paying sales tax for two years and they finally have to pay up.\nThey just...didn't do it. Didn't think it was important? I have no idea why.\nTheir reactions made it sound like they owed previous taxes, not that they\njust now had to pay them. They genuinely made it sound like they only just now\nrealized they needed to figure out sales tax. It's a baffling thing to me and\nit meant a change in prices for users that some people were not thrilled with.\n\nBut let's say that you can live with their financial issues. They'll either\nsurvive or they won't and you'll just enjoy the ride. Yet, there's a lot of\nreasons that I can't just enjoy the ride either. I think the ride is going to\nget worse and worse in ways the casual users haven't really noticed yet\nbecause of how much of it is in beta or just Ideas That Vlad (the founder of\nKagi) Had. And most of them are surrounding AI. I have to assume a lot of\npeople don't understand how deep the AI rabbithole for Kagi goes, because I\nhave seen people recommend Kagi to people frustrated with Google's own AI\nbullshit. If AI is the thing you are trying to get away from, moving to Kagi\nis a lateral move at best.\n\nAs it turns out, Kagi was founded originally as an AI company, who later\npivoted to search. And going by their comments in their Discord, AI tools seem\nto be what they spend most of their time on these days. They're launching AI\nfeatures left and right, and they have fully bought into AI being the future\nof search. They believe that by embracing AI, that will be the thing that sets\ntheir product apart (kinda late now) and get them the kind of userbase that\ncan keep them afloat financially. They have \"FastGPT\", where their focus is\nhaving a ChatGPT style service that is focused on being fast, not accurate.\nAnd boy, it sure isn't, I messed around with this for a while and it very\nconfidently gave me a lot of extremely inaccurate information about old\nsitcoms. But of course, it's all stuff where if you didn't already know the\nanswer to the question you asked you wouldn't know it was wrong--like when I\nasked it about the All in the Family episode Cousin Liz, it kept identifying\nthe woman Edith and Archie are talking to in the episode as Cousin Liz, but\nCousin Liz is instead Edith's deceased cousin who they were attending a\nfuneral for. Following a theme I asked it more broadly about homosexuality in\nAll in the Family and it spit out a bunch of text repeatedly saying that\nLionel Jefferson was gay. But I guess it did spit all of this wrong\ninformation at me faster than some of the alternatives! I wrote more about\nthis experience on fedi, even though the content warning says ChatGPT this was\ndone with Kagi's FastGPT, I was just trying to keep the thread simple at the\ntime.\n\nLike most search now Kagi has chosen to include Instant Answers that are AI\ngenerated, which means they're often wrong, as well as a \"Universal\nSummarizer\" tool, that again is more of the same old AI bullshit. There's also\na beta tool called Kagi Assitant, which I...don't know what's really different\nabout it than the other AI stuff they're doing, I think it has a chatbot mode?\nI believe you have to be a subscriber to see this. It's getting increasingly\nhard to tell some of these services apart. There's also another beta feature\ncalled Sidekick that puts Kagi AI stuff as a sidebar on your own website.\nThere was some demo where you could put someone's Twitter handle in and it\nwould give you a summary of who that person was (nightmare shit). But the\ndevelopers of Kagi fully believe that this is what search engines should be, a\nbunch of AI tools so that you don't even need to read primary sources anymore.\nIf AI is your problem with Google or Bing, Kagi is in no way a solution for\nyou. Kagi loves AI bullshit and they are going to find more and more ways to\nuse it. If you check out their Discord and listen to founder Vlad talk about\nAI tools, it's clear that he will not listen to anyone saying they might be\nbad in any way. To the point where he truly believes that AI should be used to\nremove bias from news articles, and show you which articles are \"constructive\"\nor \"good\" to view. This is something he legitimately wants to implement and he\nseems completely oblivious to the fact that this is not something AI can do,\nthat AI spits out exactly as much bias as it is fed in its model. He's 100% a\ntrue believer in AI as unbiased. (Note in the below screenshots: freediver is\nVlad's HackerNews account)\n\nIt's honestly impossible to write this without discussing Vlad a little bit.\nVlad is very \"my way or the highway\", but is the type that will try to appear\nvery measured and calm while completely unwilling to budge. And he is very,\nvery much the type that believes \"not everything is political\" and \"we don't\nget into politics\". I won't get into all of the Brave stuff because many\npeople have written about this already, but the support thread about it should\ngive you some ideas. His personal conception of bias is a guiding factor in a\nlot of Kagi's decisions but it's frankly ridiculous. For example, he has\nstated before that he thinks 3 star reviews on products are \"by definition\"\nunbiased, because they must include good and bad points. Nevermind that a lot\nof people's reviews of the recent Star Wars films were \"good space war stuff\nbut too many minorities in it\". At one point someone suggested the idea that\nsearching for suicide-related terms should bring up a helpline, and he\nrejected that idea because it would be \"biased\" (I guess towards not wanting\npeople to kill themselves). But at the same time, Kagi partners with a service\ncalled Looria to provide \"unbiased reviews\" on products in Kagi's shopping\npage. Nevermind that unbiased reviews do not exist (there is just a difference\nbetween a sincere review and a paid advertisement), but isn't promoting\ncertain products in search at least as biased as telling people to not commit\nsuicide? You're letting a third party decide what reviews your users should\nsee.\n\nAnd Vlad's attitude is also where Kagi's dedication to privacy falls apart for\nme. Generally, if someone brings up a security or privacy concern, Vlad's\nresponse is either \"trust me bro\" or \"that's not actually important\". He has\nrepeatedly stated that he feels less than 100 people on earth need full\nanonymity in a search engine (he has never, that I could find, explained where\nhe got this number or idea from). He believes that email addresses don't count\nas personally identifiable information, because you can simply use a burner\naccount. If you say that you wouldn't want Kagi using information from your\ntheoretical Kagi Email Address in your search results, and would rather have a\nProton-style privacy focused email? He says that there's nothing to worry\nabout, Kagi wouldn't do anything bad with your data. If you bring up \"what if\nKagi gets sold to someone else?\" He says well, if they sold to someone who did\nsomething bad with your data, they'd lose all of their privacy focused\ncustomers, so clearly they'd never do that. Basically anything where you say\n\"I don't want someone to have this data about what I'm doing in a search\nengine\", his reply is \"well, we wouldn't do anything with this information.\" A\nlot of questions about what information Kagi collects on people is met with\neither saying nothing (which isn't true, they connect your account to an email\naddress for payments, since it's a paid service), or saying he isn't sure, or\nsaying it doesn't matter because they won't use it anyway. Asking what data\nStripe collects on them through Kagi, and more importantly what data Stripe\nsends back TO Kagi, also gets you a vague \"I don't know\" answer. He doesn't\nentertain any discussions about GDPR because he thinks they have nothing that\napplies anyway. Questions about what would happen if the government tried to\nforce him to collect information about users are just brushed away with \"well\nwe'd simply close the company\", although he also notes that he has no problem\nwith criminals being caught through their searches and doesn't want criminals\nusing the platform.\n\nI want to note with the above, I'm not a GDPR expert either, I don't know what\ncounts legally and what doesn't, but I strongly disagree with Vlad's\nhandwaving of the issue and his insistence that email addresses aren't PII\nbecause you can use a fake one, because that's true for names and almost any\nother information as well, that logic doesn't hold up for this, and the logic\nis what I have the issue with.\n\nBetween the absolute blase attitude towards privacy, the 100% dedication to AI\nbeing the future of search, and the completely misguided use of the company's\nlimited funds, I honestly can't see Kagi as something I could ever recommend\nto people. Is the search good? I mean...it's not really much better than any\nother search, it heavily leverages Bing like DDG and the other indie search\nplatforms do, the only real killer feature it has to me is the ability to\nblock domains from your results, which I can currently only do in other search\nengines via a user script that doesn't help me on mobile. But what good is\nfiltering out all of the AI generated spamblogs on a search platform that\nwants to spit more AI generated bullshit at me directly? Sure I can turn it\noff, but who's to say that they won't start using my data to fuel their own\nLLM? They already have an extremely skewed idea of what counts as PII or not.\nThey could easily see using people's searches as being \"anonymized\" and decide\nthey're fine to use, because their primary business isn't search, it's AI.\nThey just don't want to admit to being an AI company anymore. Frankly, it's\nnot something I want to pay them to keep developing. It's something I want\nless of out in the world. Do you need to quit using Kagi? That's up to you.\nI'm not really trying to debate anyone into leaving Kagi. My only interest is\nto explain why my opinion shifted on it, and to share information that may or\nmay not shift your opinions. If they don't, it's not something I want to\ndebate people into. But I think most of the info here is going to be news to a\nlot of people, and that's the thing. Most people aren't going to dig into the\ndiscord for a project and read what the developers have said about it over\ntime, that's a bonkers thing to do that I did, just do what you will with my\nfindings. Because I know for a fact, from talking to people, that a lot of\nKagi users don't know any of this.\n\n=> Return to Home\n\n", "frontpage": true}
