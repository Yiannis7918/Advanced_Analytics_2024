John Plumb, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space\nPolicy, revealed to the media that the Russians are likely acquiring these\nitems through the black market.\n\nPhoto credit: Pixabay\n\n  * Three Russian warships shadow an enemy submarine in Sea of Japan\n  * Dual warhead upgrade: Russian Kh-101 missile packs double punch\n  * Russian Zircon missile lethality has been manipulated \u2013 Ukraine\n\nBreaking Defense, in a recent publication, notes that Washington, along with\nKyiv and SpaceX, the private space industry leader, has been coordinating\nefforts to curb the Russian military\u2019s usage of Starlink technology in\nUkraine.\n\nThe discourse about the Russian military\u2019s widespread use of Starlink first\nemerged in early February of this year. As reported by Ukrainian intelligence,\nthe Russian army purportedly uses Starlink terminals primarily in the\nUkrainian regions under their control.\n\nPhoto credit: HDBlog\n\nThe Ukrainian Ministry of Defense\u2019s Main Intelligence Directorate shared an\naudio clip on Telegram on February 11, presenting it as proof of the\n\u201csystematic\u201d usage by Russian soldiers. The audio clip, supposedly\nintercepted, is believed to contain a conversation between two members of\nRussia\u2019s 83rd Airborne Brigade discussing the installation of terminals in\nEastern Ukraine.\n\nThe scale of the usage or the procurement methods for these terminals was not\ndisclosed by the Ukrainian Directorate. Andriy Yusov, the spokesperson,\nconveyed to Ukrainian media on February 10, leading to speculation about the\nissue becoming \u201csystematic\u201d.\n\nIn response to this, SpaceX, the company that operates Starlink terminals,\nmade a statement on February 8 on its social platform, formerly known as\nTwitter. The company clarified that it has no business affiliation with the\nRussian government or its military and that its services do not extend to\nRussia. Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, dispelled any rumors about his\ncompany providing equipment to Russia on his profile on February 11.\n\nPhoto by Yasuyoshi Chiba\n\nThe recent rumors suggesting that SpaceX was engaging in the sale of Starlink\nterminals to Russia have been emphatically debunked. \u201cSuch reports are\nunfounded and patently incorrect,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cTo the best of our\nknowledge, there has been no direct or indirect sale of Starlink to Russia,\u201d\nit further explains.\n\nA provocative discovery from the ongoing conflict in Ukraine recently\nresurrected the debate about Starlink\u2019s use by Russian forces. On April 3,\n2024, during a routine patrol near the Romanian village of Tuzla, an\nunexpected finding was made by the Coast Guard \u2013 a mysteriously operating\nnaval drone. The drone bore a striking resemblance to an ordinary search-and-\nrescue speedboat, from the paintwork to the design. However, its unusual\nmovement pattern raised suspicion.\n\nIt\u2019s noteworthy that this news was made public on April 6, 2024, three days\nafter the discovery, following media coverage. The Romanian Ministry of\nDefense offered only a cryptic comment on the matter, which was posted on\ntheir official portal, classifying the unusual object as \u201cseemingly a sea\ndrone\u201d.\n\nPhoto credit: Flickr\n\nWhat really makes this discovery so intriguing is the fact that this device\nwas camouflaged as a simple search and rescue boat. To the untrained eye on a\nnearby ship, it would appear as nothing more than that\u2014this enhances the\npotential threat it poses, thereby making it even more unsettling.\n\nUnofficial reports are brewing from the Telegram account of Russia\u2019s \u201cCenter\nfor Strategic and Technological Analysis\u201d, typically known as bmpd. The\ninformation shared points towards the device being an old salvage vessel that\ndisplaces 3 tons of water, utilizing a Starlink terminal for its control\nmechanism. However, the real showstopper seems to be the speculated warhead,\nallegedly from the first-generation Soviet anti-ship missile, the P-15, adding\na new twist to the tale.\n\nClaims regarding the use of Starlink in Ukraine by the US military don\u2019t\nsolely stem from Ukrainian sources. Evidence unearthed in Sudan points to the\nprocurement of Starlink satellite terminals by armed groups in Sudan with\nlinks to Moscow.\n\n\u201c... It\u2019s hard to say whether Russia\u2019s use of SpaceX terminals can be termed\nas illegal,\u201d commented Plumb. \u201cBut they are undoubtedly unlicensed, and\ncertainly not authorized by the invaded country.\u201d\n\nStarlink is a satellite internet concept envisioned by SpaceX, an American\naerospace manufacturer and space transportation company established by Elon\nMusk. The project envisages the creation of a constellation of thousands of\nuniformly produced small satellites in low Earth orbit [LEO], working in\ncombination with ground transceivers. SpaceX plans to provide satellite\ninternet connectivity to areas of the planet where such services are sparse\nwhile also ensuring their offerings are competitively priced for urban areas.\n\nStarlink\u2019s ultimate aim is to enhance the existing infrastructure of the\ninternet, bringing speedy and reliable connectivity to areas where internet\naccess has been inconsistent, expensive, or completely non-existent. Its\nstrategy involves positioning satellites in low Earth orbit to reduce\ncommunication latency and using lasers to boost internet speeds beyond the\nlimitations set by traditional satellites.\n\nEvery Starlink satellite features a phased array antenna, a tool that allows\nthe satellite to concentrate its signal onto a specific geographic area on\nEarth, thereby improving the quality and speed of the internet connection.\nAdditionally, each satellite is equipped with ion thrusters, powered by\nkrypton, which enable the satellites to ascend, maneuver in space, and deorbit\nafter their lifecycle ends.\n\nThese satellites utilize lasers to communicate with each other, eliminating\nthe need for terrestrial ground stations to facilitate data transfer between\nsatellites. This capability allows for the provision of internet service\nacross the high seas and remote areas. Subsequently, the data is relayed back\ndown to terrestrial stations and eventually disseminated to the broader\ninternet.\n\nFinally, Starlink employs a process known as \u2018trunking\u2019, a method of data\ntransmission where multiple signals are combined for transmission and\nsubsequently separated upon receipt. This process results in an increased\ncapacity for data transmission at any given time, thus enhancing the overall\nefficacy of the network.\n\nAre you eager to understand how this all operates in reality? Firstly, you\u2019d\nneed a Starlink Kit to connect with the network. This unique assembly\ncomprises a phased-array antenna [or \u2018Dish\u2019], a stand, a power supply, and a\nreliable modem at its core. Interestingly, SpaceX has nicknamed the Dish\n\u2018Dishy McFlatface\u2019. What\u2019s its primary function? To maintain continuous\ncommunication with the Starlink satellites by autonomously maneuvering to\nsecure the clearest view of the sky, thereby ensuring your internet connection\nremains steady and fast.\n\nShall we delve deeper into the ins and outs of the comparative advantages\nStarlink could offer in wartime circumstances or military operations? The\nstandout feature here is undeniably the improved communication ability\nStarlink provides. Its high-speed, low-latency internet fosters efficient and\neffectual military communication, particularly in remote or severe\nenvironments. The outcome? Enhanced coordination and faster decision-making,\nboth of which are indispensable in times of conflict.\n\nAnother noteworthy point is Starlink\u2019s role in providing dependable\nintelligence and surveillance. With global coverage, real-time data can be\nswiftly relayed from drones or other surveillance channels thanks to Starlink.\nThis provides military forces the tools to stay ahead of enemy movements and\nproperly assess potential threats.\n\nPhoto credit: BBC\n\nThe redundancy and resilience offered by Starlink should not be overlooked\neither. Conventional communication systems might falter under attack or\ndisruption. In contrast, the robust network of Starlink made up of thousands\nof satellites, proves to be more difficult to disrupt. Even if a few\nsatellites are affected, others take over ensuring uninterrupted service. This\nresilience adds another layer of security, making it difficult for adversaries\nto interfere with military communications.\n\nLastly, we must not forget the technological superiority Starlink can provide.\nThis high-speed, low-latency internet service caters to advanced military\ntechnologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cloud-\nbased systems. The strategic planning, decision-making, and operational\nefficiency that these technologies can offer mean that those leveraging this\nservice will have the upper hand.\n\n***\n\nFollow us everywhere and at any time.
