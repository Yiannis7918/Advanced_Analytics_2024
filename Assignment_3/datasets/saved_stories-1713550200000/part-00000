At TON\nFoundation, we believe this is the biggest step in the Web3 space towards\nmaking digital currencies actually useful for the global population. Together\nwith Tether, we\u2019re enabling one of the most common use cases for digital\ncurrencies on the planet \u2013 peer-to-peer payments, and we\u2019re making it as easy\nas sending a message. There are no intermediaries, no borders, and no limits.\n\n\u201cWe're excited to bring USDt to The Open Network because we support its vision\nof an open and decentralized internet and a borderless financial system,\u201d said\nPaolo Ardoino, CEO at Tether. \u201cThe launch of USDt on TON will allow seamless\nvalue transfer globally in a simple experience that can match even the\ntraditional financial system. This furthers our mission of powering open\nfinancial infrastructure across the blockchain space.\u201d\n\nThis move supports TON\u2019s mission to put crypto in every pocket and integrate\n\u2018under the hood\u2019 Web3 services into the daily lives of Telegram users. Only\nthrough meeting users where they are, with valuable applications that improve\neveryday life, will the digital space onboard billions of users. This\nintegration is likely one of the first-ever actually useful use cases with\npotential for global adoption. TON integrated into Telegram and, in\npartnership with Tether, will onboard hundreds of millions of cryptocurrency\nusers to Web3.\n\nPlease note that USDt on TON is not available to users based in mainland US,\nUS territories, or US citizens and Prohibited Countries as defined under\nTether\u2019s Terms of Service.\n\n##\n\nWhat is USDt?\n\nUSDt, also known as Tether, is the most used and best-known stablecoin, with\nover $85 billion in daily volume and a total market cap of $106 billion. USDt\ntoken is pegged 1-to-1 with USD and backed 100% by Tether\u2019s reserves. This 1:1\npegging gives USDt a stable value, setting it apart from other, more volatile\ndigital currencies. Such stability is essential for daily transactions,\ntrading, remittances, and protecting your holdings against the price\nfluctuations of other digital currencies. This means that stablecoins can be\nused for exchanges, DeFi, and peer-to-peer transactions.\n\nUSDt is commonly used for:\n\n  * Hedging: As a stable asset, USDt allows users to mitigate cryptocurrency price volatility risk.\n  * Everyday transactions: Its stability makes it suitable for daily activities like online shopping and payments.\n  * Cross-border payments: USDt on TON offers low fees and instant transactions, making international transactions more straightforward and cost-effective.\n\nUntil now, USDt has never been matched with a distribution platform and user\nexperience that could actually provide a simple, easy-to-use global payments\nexperience that would reach the masses.\n\n##\n\nStart of a new era in digital finance\n\nLaunching USDt on TON marks a significant advancement in digital finance.\nTON\u2019s unmatched efficiency, scalability, and security, matched with Telegram\u2019s\nviral mechanics and massive 900 million strong user base, creates the perfect\nenvironment for USDt, increasing its utility and accessibility.\n\nAdvantages of USDt on TON:\n\n  * Seamless Telegram integration: USDt on TON will be seamlessly integrated into Telegram, offering a uniquely user-friendly experience that positions TON as the most convenient blockchain for USDt transactions. This integration will simplify DeFi for Telegram users, making it more accessible and understandable.\n  * Lower transaction fees: TON is already one of the most affordable Layer 1 networks, but with USDt, we\u2019re taking things one step further. The core TON development team has optimized Tether\u2019s smart contract to make it three times cheaper than any other jetton. A transaction between two USDt users is fixed at just 0.0145 TON (~$0.10), a reduction of 66% in cost compared to other jettons.\n  * Faster and scalable: TON\u2019s high throughput and rapid confirmation times enable USDt transactions to be processed more quickly than ever before.\n\nFurthermore, the TON-based Wallet in Telegram allows people to transfer USDt\ninstantly and with no fees to their Telegram contacts worldwide. Exchanges and\nbuilt-in on-ramps, including bank transfers, cards, and P2P, will be present\nat the launch, while off-ramps will soon enable global entry and exit from\ncrypto on TON and Telegram, becoming a critical web3 gateway for Telegram\nusers. This borderless USDt experience in Telegram is a bold step toward\nrealizing Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s vision of \u201ca purely peer-to-peer\nelectronic cash without an intermediary,\u201d packaged in a simple experience.\n\n##\n\nHow USDt on TON benefits the ecosystem\n\nFor the TON Community, integrating USDt into the Wallet in Telegram and across\nthe wider TON Ecosystem significantly improves the USDt transaction\nexperience, setting it apart from other blockchain solutions. For the first\ntime, users can take advantage of a native TON stablecoin within the\necosystem, benefiting from transfers within Telegram to any global contact for\nfree via the Wallet in Telegram. With other on-chain wallets, users only pay\nnetwork fees, and there are no hidden costs or markups. On-chain gas fees can\nalso be paid in USDt-TON soon after launch.\n\nFor newcomers to cryptocurrencies, USDt on TON offers an accessible entry\npoint. It combines the advantages of digital currencies with the stability of\ntraditional fiat currencies, greatly simplifying the crypto experience and\ngiving beginners a secure foundation to discover the advantages of DeFi on\nTelegram.\n\n##\n\n11 Million Toncoin in USDt Launch Incentives\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be a true crypto launch without massive incentives. This being the\nlaunch of the worlds largest stablecoin, inside one of the world's largest\ninstant messengers, on one of the world\u2019s fastest blockchains - it needed to\nbe pretty special.\n\n11 Million Toncoin in user incentives for early adopters of USDt on TON:\n\n  * 5 million Toncoin to Wallet-in-Telegram\u2019s USDt Earn - just buy or deposit USDt and Earn a yield return on the amount you deposit to the program.\n  * 5 million Toncoin in boosts for Liquidity Pools across TON\u2019s 2 largest DEXs - Ston.fi and DeDust.
