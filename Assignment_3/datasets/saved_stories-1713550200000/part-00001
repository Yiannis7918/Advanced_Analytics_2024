(Image credit: NASA Goddard)\n\nCould the cosmos be dominated by particles that move faster than the speed of\nlight? This model of the universe agrees surprisingly well with observations,\na pair of physicists has discovered.\n\nIn a new paper that has yet to be peer-reviewed, the physicists propose that\nour universe is dominated by tachyons \u2014 a hypothetical kind of particle that\nalways moves faster than light. Tachyons almost certainly don't exist; going\nfaster than light violates everything we know about the causal flow of time\nfrom past to future. But the hypothetical particles are still interesting to\nphysicists because of the small chance that even our most closely held\nnotions, like causality, might be wrong.\n\nThe researchers suggest that tachyons might be the true identity of dark\nmatter, the mysterious form of matter that makes up most of the mass of almost\nevery single galaxy in the universe, outweighing normal matter 5 to 1.\nAstronomers and physicists alike currently do not know what dark matter is\nmade of, so they are free to cook up all manner of ideas \u2014\u2013 because, after\nall, sometimes a far-out idea is right, and even if it's wrong, it can help us\non the path to a better understanding.\n\nThe researchers calculate that an expanding universe filled with tachyons can\ninitially slow down in its expansion before reaccelerating. Our universe is\ncurrently in an accelerating phase, driven by a phenomenon known as dark\nenergy, so this tachyon cosmological model can potentially explain both dark\nenergy and dark matter at the same time.\n\nRelated: There may be a 'dark mirror' universe within ours where atoms failed\nto form, new study suggests\n\nTo test this idea, the physicists applied their model to observations of Type\nIa supernovae, a kind of stellar explosion that allows cosmologists to build a\nrelationship between distance and the expansion rate of the universe. It was\nthrough Type Ia supernovae that astronomers in the late 1990s first discovered\nthat the universe's expansion rate is accelerating.\n\nA Type Ia supernova seen in the galaxy M82 by the Hubble Space Telescope.\nThese explosions allow astronomers to estimate the expansion rate of the\nuniverse. (Image credit: NASA Goddard)\n\nThe physicists found that a tachyon cosmological model was just as good at\nexplaining the supernova data as the standard cosmological model involving\ndark matter and dark energy. That itself is a surprise, given how unorthodox\nthis idea is.\n\n## Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now\n\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nHowever, that's only the beginning. We now have access to a wealth of data\nabout the large-scale universe, like the cosmic microwave background (remnant\nradiation released just after the Big Bang) and the arrangement of galaxies at\nthe very largest scales. The next step is to continue testing this idea\nagainst those additional observations.\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\n\u2014Millions of invisible 'mirror stars' could exist in the Milky Way, and\nastronomers know how to find them\n\n\u20141st images from the Euclid 'dark universe' telescope are here \u2014 and they're\njaw-dropping\n\n\u2014Large Hadron Collider could be generating dark matter in its particle jets\n\nThe tachyon cosmological model is unlikely to pass those rigorous experimental\ntests, given the unlikely nature of tachyons. But continuing to push in new,\neven unorthodox, directions is important in cosmology; we never know when we\nmight get a breakthrough. Scientists have been attempting to understand dark\nmatter for 50 years and dark energy for a quarter century, without any\nconclusive results. The solutions to these conundrums are likely to come from\nunexpected directions.\n\nThe team's research was published to the preprint database arXiv in March.\n\nPaul Sutter\n\nAstrophysicist\n\nPaul M.

Both\ntheoretical and experimental evidence is presented and has been confirmed by\nmany independent researchers over the past 20 years. This result is\nincompatible with Relativity theory and analysis shows that the Special\nRelativistic effects on time and space are an optical illusion. The same is\ntrue for General Relativity since it is based on Special Relativity. It is\nproposed that Galilean Relativity and Gravitoelectromagnetism theory of\ngravity are better theories for Relativity and Gravity, where time and space\nare absolute, and only the present exists. Since Gravitoelectromagnetism\nassumes gravity is a propagating field, it can be quantized (graviton),\nenabling the unification of Gravity and Quantum Mechanics. The Pilot Wave\ninterpretation of Quantum Mechanics now becomes the preferred interpretation\nof Quantum Mechanics because it is completely compatible with Galilean\nRelativity, and instantaneous propagating fields.\n\n*YouTube presentation of above argument: sePdJ7vSQvQ:0View: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sePdJ7vSQvQ&t=0s\n\n*Paper this presentation is based on: William D.

Consider atmospheric gaseous mediums such as our atmosphere . The\natmospheric particles are transparent , effectively invisible . These\nparticles allow light to pass through but gravitational-B drag forces some of\nthe light to curve around the particles . ( An advanced version of a Rayleigh\nScattering) . These particles are not great at conserving light (heat) but\nthey are great at obstructing surface light from escaping when it is daytime .\nThe reason for this is because of incident thermal current and reflective\nthermal current creating a ''thermocline'' . Although the term thermocline is\nassociated with water , the atmosphere isn't far dissimilar because it is also\na medium . Atmosphere rises/expands when there is sufficient light to give it\nenough mass-B to be affected more by gravity-B than gravity-A . When it exits\nthe lower ''thermocline'' into a higher altitude , the mass-B is lost in space\nand mass-A regains hold and brings it back down to the lower ''thermocline'' .\nIt is possible a transparent particle could gain enough temporal mass-B to\nescape an atmosphere into space but the temporal conserved mass-B would soon\nbe lost so it would be impossible for it to travel faster than light .\nAdditionally the faster a particle travels , the greater the gravitational\nframe drag .\n\nReply\n\n  * tcny2023\n\n> danr2222 said:\n>\n> Non-causality is a feature, not a bug, in this theory.

He didn't believe it, since in his view nothing could\ntravel faster than light, although at least some experts in the field don't\nconsider the quantum entities to be actually \"communicating\".\n\nReply\n\n  * WPJLee1983\n\n> danr2222 said:\n>\n> Non-causality is a feature, not a bug, in this theory.

The philosophers I hang out with are all\naware that causality transcends materiality, and therefore time itself.\n\nWhat brought me here was the suggestion that causality could be broken\u2014a\nfascinating yet ultimately self-negating proposition (the ramblings of David\nHume notwithstanding)\u2014but come to find out we're just talking about confusing\nbehaviors of temporo-spatial accidents...not \"real\" (metaphysical) causality.\n\nReply\n\n  * tcny2023\n\n> danr2222 said:\n>\n> Non-causality is a feature, not a bug, in this theory.
