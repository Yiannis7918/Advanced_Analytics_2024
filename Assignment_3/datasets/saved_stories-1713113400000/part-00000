In contrast, forage\nfish are highly nutritious, environmentally friendly and the most abundant\nfish species in the world\u2019s oceans.\n\nWhile research has shown the benefits of forage fish, until now it has been\nunclear to what extent they might cut the global burden of disease if\nsubstituted for red meat. Now a team of Japanese and Australian researchers\nhave an answer after conducting the largest analysis of its kind, involving\ndata from more than 130 countries.\n\nSwapping red meat for forage fish could prevent 750,000 deaths a year and\nsignificantly reduce the prevalence of disability as a result of diet-related\ndisease, they found.\n\nAdopting this type of diet would be especially helpful for low- and middle-\nincome countries, where these fish are cheap and plentiful, and where the toll\ntaken by heart disease in particular is high, the researchers added.\n\n\u201cTo improve human health and the health of the planet we should limit the\nconsumption of red meat and move towards foods that are both healthy and\nenvironmentally friendly,\u201d they wrote in the journal BMJ Global Health.\n\u201cCompared with red meat, seafood not only provides a higher concentration of\nessential nutrients, but also prevents diet related non-communicable diseases\n(NCDs).\n\n\u201cOur study demonstrates that the adoption of forage fish as a red meat\nalternative would potentially offer substantial public health benefits (with\nthe avoidance globally of 0.5\u20130.75m deaths from diet related NCDs),\nparticularly in terms of reducing ischaemic heart disease.\u201d\n\nForage fish are rich in omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, the\nintake of which may prevent coronary heart disease, as well as being abundant\nin calcium and vitamin B12. They also have the lowest carbon footprint of any\nanimal food source, the researchers said.\n\nHowever, at the moment three-quarters of the forage fish catch is ground into\nfishmeal and fish oil \u2013 products mostly used for fish farming.\n\nThe researchers modelled four scenarios, each representing a different pattern\nof forage fish allocation globally. They used data for projected red meat\nconsumption in 2050 for 137 countries and historical data on the forage fish\ncatch from marine habitats.\n\nGlobally, this approach could prevent as many as 750,000 deaths from diet-\nrelated disease in 2050 and avert up to 15m years of life lived with a\ndisability.\n\nThe limited supply of forage fish isn\u2019t sufficient to replace all red meat,\nthe researchers acknowledged. But swapping them could still substantially cut\nthe global burden of disease.\n\n\u201cOur analysis suggests that forage fish is a promising alternative to red\nmeat,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cThis study points to the need for fish-based\nfood policy guidelines and nutrition-sensitive policies to pay more attention\nto the composition of future fish intake and to promote forage fish\nconsumption.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Meat\n  * Fish\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Food\n  * Japan\n  * Heart disease\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### Australians dropping fruit and vegetables from diet amid cost-of-living crisis\n\n1d ago\n\n  * ### \u2018People mustn\u2019t feel meat is being taken away\u2019: German hospitals serve planetary health diet\n\n28 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### \u2018It\u2019s eating what the sea provides\u2019: Galicia\u2019s Atlantic diet eclipses Mediterranean cousin\n\n1d ago\n\n  * ### No more Sunday roasts: UK readers on why they are eating less meat\n\n26 Oct 2023\n\n  * ### UK meat consumption at lowest level since records began, data reveals\n\n24 Oct 2023\n\n  * ### Experts say we need to eat 30 plants a week.
