I would be preaching to the choir.\n\nHaving me at an accessibility conference speaking in front of a crowd of\npeople that either already know and are well-versed in accessibility, is not\nproductive in my opinion. Accessibility people, for the lack of a better term,\nare judgy. We have to be. Not that I am afraid of criticism and critique, I\njust feel that if I am talking to folks who are doing the work, than it is\ncounter-productive.\n\nNow they may not be up to speed in what I might be talking about by some slim\nchance, I am aware of that, I may be missing out on maybe a piece of something\nthat may educate them.\n\nThen there are the folks who are new and just learning. Yes, this is something\nI am missing and probably should, but that was what articles and writing about\naccessibility was all about. I recognize that fact.\n\n## Reasons\n\nTake the accessibility advocacy to the places you're not going to hear much,\nif anything at all at. Java conferences, .net conferences, DevOps, DevRel,\netc. Open the curtains and let the light in. It is something to get a few\npeople educated. There is a lot of education online now thankfully from great\npeople like Marcy Sutton and Sara Soueidan, and many more.\n\nLots of resources I always link to in my slides and in my articles in the\npast.\n\nHowever, seeing those faces when I present something to developers in much\ndifferent spaces is the types of reactions I loved (and still love) to see.\nRaising awareness, bring light into a rather dark corner of development where\naccessibility may not be practiced much, if at all.\n\nThat is why.\n\n## The Conference\n\nIt has been a privilege and I am grateful to have had the chance to speak at\nDevnexus for the past few years. The event is one of the best that Pratik and\nVince put on each year and one I highly recommend to people. Even if it is not\na talk that is Java-centric, speak here, or at least attend and learn from the\nmany talks by lots of great speakers who are the greatest of people.\n\nLots of sponsors and lots of learning. Iw as able to duck into some talks for\na bit and see some great talks. Plan your days around what talks you want to\nsee. Visit sponsors to learn what they are offering. Pick up some cool swag!\n\nNetworking at Devnexus is probably one of the best things you can do while\nhere. I have met a ton of great people from all over the world. Some of the\nsmartest, brightest, and hardest working people who do good things.\n\nThe talks I was able to see from folks were great learning experiences. Well\nworth the price of admission. You are getting your money's worth and more.\n\n## The Week in Review. The TL;DR\n\nWith the passing of my aunt on Monday, My heart was heavy and my mind was\nfull. Which I feel stuck with me through the week. As I write this, I can feel\nthat weight. I felt this weight during my talk too. I think that affected the\ntalk.\n\nI had to refer to notes, I had messed up an answer which was on a slide which\nI have never done. But I gave myself the grace that maybe it wasn't a great\ntalk but I had a pretty full room. Little things that are broken shoelaces\nthat I tend to still blow way out of proportion.\n\nI got through, it felt like it was a good talk and it was well received. I may\nbe wrong. I may be right. I don't know. My heart still feels heavy though.\n\n## Friends\n\nIt is always good to see the friends that I have made over the years and that\nis what makes the conference circuit (for me) worth the flying, the travel,\nthe hotels, the time away from home. Seeing those faces a guy like me loves to\nsee.\n\n## Details, Please?\n\nI know this is a high-level overview, with not much context. I kept my talk at\na high-level, this time has been different as I draw my speaking engagements\nto a close. Emotionally, mentally, I am exhausted. Physically the walking,\nwhile great exercise, takes its toll on my body.\n\nLet me just say this and trust me when I say this.\n\nDevnexus is a conference you want to speak at, a conference you want to\nattend. A conference that you want to get an experience at for the hallway\ntracks, the talks, the education, the networking.\n\nGet yourself to a Devnexus soon and tell me you did not have a good time. I\nwould be shocked if you didn't.\n\n## \u00a91999 \u2014 2024, Todd Libby.\n\n## #BlackLivesMatter \u00b7 #StopAsianHate \u00b7 #ProtectTransKids\n\n", "frontpage": false}
