She's part of a team of scientists\nwho have been tracking the lake's decline amid the West's record megadrought\nmade worse by climate change. They've been conducting weekly trips to various\nsampling and study sites for the last several years at the remote lake that\nonly recently started making international headlines due to its sharp decline.\n\nEven since its water levels peaked in the 1980s, the Great Salt Lake has\nalways had this mysterious vibe. It's shallow and boggy. It can stink,\nespecially in the heat of summer.\n\nBut zero in right here at this private sanctuary - where steady water still\nflows in due to a complex web of agreements - and it soon becomes clear how\nalive this ecosystem can be and how hugely important of a stopover it is for\nmigratory birds.\n\n### Despite recent moisture, the lake is still shrinking\n\n2023 brought record snow to Utah, and a healthy spillover of runoff into the\nimperiled lake. Scientists warn the lake has already shrunk nearly in half\nfrom its historical average.\n\n\"It's because of so many years of drought and climate change and water\ndiversions, and we can't keep going like that,\" says Bonnie Baxter, director\nof the Great Salt Lake Institute.\n\nBut she says there's still time to reverse its decline. The last two years has\nbought the state some time. Researchers here are already detecting sharp\ndeclines in shorebird populations such as burrowing owls and snowy plovers. As\nthe lake and its wetlands dry, the brine shrimp the birds feed on are dying\nout.\n\n\"For these birds that queue into these saline habitats, there are fewer places\nfor them to go,\" says Heidi Hoven, a wetlands ecologist who helps manage the\nGillmor. \"All the saline lakes here in the West, and many in the world, are\nexperiencing this loss of water and in essence that relates to a loss in\nhabitat.\"\n\n### There are plenty of culprits behind the lake drying up\n\nScientists say the West is believed to be as dry as it's been in 1200 years.\nThe megadrought made worse by climate change has been contributing to the\nGreat Salt Lake's decline. But agriculture usually bears the bulk of the\nblame. Upstream water diversions for expanding alfalfa farms and dairies has\nmeant less and less flows into the lake. Utah's population is also booming.\nHoven says development is now running right up to the sanctuary.\n\n\"You can actually see it over your shoulder,\" she gestures. \"It's this\nadvancement of large, distribution warehouses that are within a mile from the\nsanctuary now where it used to be open land.\"\n\nA short, bumpy ride later along a rutted out dirt track, Hoven pulls to a stop\nat a favorite vista. The setting sun is casting an eerie orange glow over the\ndistant mountains that ring the dry lake bed. It stretches for miles with just\na few pools of water here or there.\n\nIt's beautiful but also eerie, even for the trained eye of wildlife biologists\nlike Biedul, who make weekly research trips to the lake.\n\n\"Otherworldly is a great word,\" she says. \"It's crazy. We're at Great Salt\nLake right now but there's no water. The other places where I go and sample\nthere's water there at least. But here we're still at the lake and it's dry.\"\n\nHoven chimes in, solemnly.\n\n\"It's just so shocking, and you know, it's a shock to me every time I see it,\"\nshe says. \"But to see someone view it for the first time. You can really see\nthem taking it in. You never thought you could see this dryness.\"\n\n### The state is being galvanized into action\n\nBut all this shock and alarm, the scientists say, may be good. It's pressuring\nstate leaders into action. Utah Governor Spencer Cox has pledged the lake\nwon't dry up on his watch. The state legislature has put upwards of a billion\ndollars lately into water conservation programs, most geared to farmers.\n\n\"For generations the lake was seen as kind of this dead thing that just\nhappens to be there and will always be there,\" Cox told NPR recently. \"And now\nthat people are realizing there's a potential that it might not always be\nhere, that's gotten people's attention in a positive way.\"\n\nEverything from lake effect snow for the lucrative ski industry, to mining, to\nair quality depends on the lake's survival. Recent publicity around the crisis\nhas raised public awareness but also started to bring more money which could\nlead to more comprehensive research that could inform everything from\nstrategic action plans to save the lake to just understanding how the\nremaining migratory birds are coping.\n\nHeidi Hoven, the wetlands ecologist, sees the shorebirds as a key indicator\nspecies.\n\n\"We have so much more to understand about what their needs are,\" she says. \"In\nthese changing times, it's really highlighting the need to understand these\nthings quickly.\"\n\nThe scientists say the last two winters may have bought Utah a little time,\nbut no one in the West is counting on another good snow year next year.\n\n### Transcript\n\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\n\nTrip now out to Utah's Great Salt Lake, where water levels are up 3 feet after\na couple of especially wet winters. That's actually good news because the lake\nhas been drying up fast. It is now about half of its historical size. NPR's\nKirk Siegler recently took a trip to a private wildlife sanctuary there, with\nscientists who've been warning about a looming ecological disaster.\n\nKIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: Just west of Salt Lake City and its newly built\ninternational airport, we drive through a series of locked gates, heading for\nthe Audubon's Gillmor Sanctuary.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF GATE LOCK OPENING)\n\nSIEGLER: It's like entering into another world - or maybe otherworldly -\nlandscape, the vast wetlands along the Great Salt Lake, 50 miles long and 30\nwide.\n\nCARLY BIEDUL: Yeah, it's quite an adventure to get out here.\n\nSIEGLER: It's always had this mysterious vibe. It's shallow. It's boggy. It\nstinks. But zero in right here, and you realize how alive it can be, how\nhugely important of a stopover it is for migratory birds.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF BIRDS SINGING)\n\nSIEGLER: Sadly, sounds like these, archived by the University of Utah back in\n2011, are becoming more and more rare out here. As the lake and its wetlands\ndry, the brine shrimp the birds feed on are dying. Heidi Hoven, a wetlands\necologist who helps manage the sanctuary, is leading our expedition.\n\nHEIDI HOVEN: There's less and less places for these birds that do queue in to\nthese saline habitats. There's fewer places for them to go.\n\nSIEGLER: Hoven and her team are tracking a sharp decline, particularly in\nburrowing owls and snowy plovers, white-breasted with their tiny black beaks.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF BIRD SINGING)\n\nSIEGLER: There are plenty of culprits behind the lake drying up. Farmers are\ndiverting a lot of water upstream from here that used to flow into it. Utah's\npopulation is also booming, and that development is running right up to us.\n\nHOVEN: You can actually see it over your shoulder. We have - it's this\nadvancement of large distribution warehouses that are within a mile from the\nsanctuary now, when it used to be just open land.\n\nSIEGLER: Back in her pickup, Hoven steers expertly through a series of huge,\nmuddy puddles that look like they could swallow us.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TRUCK DRIVING THROUGH MUD)\n\nHOVEN: So there's a little bit of road base left under all that.\n\nSIEGLER: For the scientists, the mud is an encouraging sign. Utah is coming\noff two snowy winters.\n\nHOVEN: So we can park here. This is a good get-out place.\n\nSIEGLER: We stopped for a beat to take it all in, just shy of the lake bed.\nBonnie Baxter, who runs the Great Salt Lake Institute at nearby Westminster\nUniversity, chimes in.\n\nBONNIE BAXTER: You know, I think we've bought ourselves a couple of years, and\nthat's great. But you look at this dry lake bed in front of you, and you can\nsee, even after all of that snow from last year and a decent year this year,\nwe're still struggling.\n\nSIEGLER: A short, bumpy ride later, we reached the actual shore, if you could\ncall it that. The setting sun is casting an eerie orange glow over the distant\nmountains surrounding us on all sides. We feel tiny.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TRUCK DOOR CLOSING)\n\nSIEGLER: The dried lake bed stretches out for miles. It's beautiful, but it's\neerie, even for the trained eye of wildlife biologist Carly Biedul.\n\nBIEDUL: Otherworldly is a great word. It is - well, it's crazy. We're at Great\nSalt Lake right now, but there's no water.\n\nBAXTER: Yeah.\n\nBIEDUL: Like, I feel like the other places - at least where I go and sample -\nthere's water there. At least you can see it. But here we're still at the\nlake, and it's dry.\n\nSIEGLER: Heidi Hoven says she's never not shocked looking out across the dry\nsand and dust.\n\nHOVEN: It never ends to really strike people with awe in a way that -\nsomething that you never thought you could see, this dryness.\n\nSIEGLER: But all this alarm, they say, is maybe good. It's pressuring the\nstate into action. Utah's governor, Spencer Cox, is pledging the lake won't\ndry up on his watch. The state has put a billion dollars so far toward\nconservation, mainly for farmers.\n\nSPENCER COX: For generations, the lake was seen as just kind of this dead\nthing that just happens to be there and will always be there. And now that\npeople are realizing there's a potential that it might not always be here,\nthat's gotten people's attention in a positive way.\n\nSIEGLER: Everything from lake effect snow for the ski industry to mining to\nair quality depends on the lake's survival.\n\nBIEDUL: Is that coyote scat?\n\nSIEGLER: But Cox has also called predictions by local scientists that the lake\ncould dry up in five years alarmist. Bonnie Baxter from the institute helped\nwrite that 2022 study.\n\nBAXTER: You know, scientists aren't really known for being dramatic\n(laughter).\n\nSIEGLER: What will be more dramatic, these scientists say, is if we let the\nlake dry up. Heidi Hoven sees the shorebirds as one of the indicator species.\n\nHOVEN: And we have probably so much more to understand about what their needs\nare. And in these changing times, it's really highlighting the need to\nunderstand these things quickly.\n\nSIEGLER: Because no one in the West is counting on another good snow year next\nyear.\n\nKirk Siegler, NPR News, Salt Lake City.\n\n\u00a9 NPR\n\n", "frontpage": false}
