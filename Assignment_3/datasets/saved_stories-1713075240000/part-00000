We won a Webby Award, published a\nbook, and brought happiness to a lot of people.\n\nStarting today, 43 Things users can export their goals and entries from the\nsite. Starting August 15, we will make the site \u201cread only\u201d. 43 Things users\nwill still be able to view the site and export their content, but we won\u2019t be\ntaking any new content from users. We hope to leave the site up for folks to\nsee and download their content until the end of the year. Ending on New Year\u2019s\nEve takes us full circle.\n\nIt has been a long ride (one of our original goals was to \"build a company\nthat lasts at least 2 years\u201d - we beat that one!) While we wish the site could\nlive on, it has suffered from a number of challenges - changes in how people\nuse the site, the advertising industry, and how search engines view the site.\nWe wish the outcome was different \u2013 but we\u2019ve always been realistic about when\nour goals are met and when they aren't.\n\nAs of today, you will be able to download your goals and entries. See more\nabout that on the FAQ page. Thanks for 10 great years of goal-setting and\nachieving.\n\n\\- The Robots.\n\nExport My Content\n\nFAQ\n\n# The world's most popular goals\n\nSummary | How I Did It | Entries and Comments | Goals | People\n\n  1. blog 51713 people\n  2. lose weight 42100 people\n  3. write a book 31381 people\n  4. stop procrastinating 30441 people\n  5.
