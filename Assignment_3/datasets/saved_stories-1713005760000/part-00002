We walk\nfounders through the following framework during Arc, our company-building\nimmersion for pre-seed and seed stage companies. Rather than diagnosing\nwhether you have product-market fit, this framework outlines three distinct\narchetypes of PMF which help you understand your product\u2019s place in the market\nand determine how your company operates.\n\n## 3 Archetypes of Product-Market Fit\n\nUltimately, product-market fit is about your product\u2019s place in the world.\nThere are different aspects to how your product fits into the world that you\ncould hone in on\u2014competitive landscape, the technical merits of your product,\netc. We think the best way is to start by focusing on how the customer relates\nto the problem your product solves.\n\nThere are different kinds of problems, and different ways customers relate to\nthem. We see three basic archetypes, each with its own distinct customer-\nproduct relationship dynamics.\n\n### Hair on Fire\n\nYou solve a problem that\u2019s a clear, urgent need for customers. The demand is\nobvious. Because of this, your category is likely crowded with competitors\nvying for market share. Your customers are actively wrestling with the\nproblem, and likely comparing existing products to solve it. To succeed in\nsuch a dynamic, you must rise above the noise. The only way to do so is by\ndelivering the best-in-class solution. And best-in-class products stand out\nbecause they are different, not merely better. You can\u2019t just be faster or\ncheaper\u2014you need a truly differentiated customer experience to have a durable\nadvantage.\n\n### Hard Fact\n\nYou take a pain point universally accepted as a hard fact of life, and see\nthat it\u2019s merely a hard problem that your product solves for the customer.\nYour customers have resigned themselves to just living with the problem.\nThey\u2019re not urgently engaged with trying to solve it. The status quo is just\nhow it is, and change doesn\u2019t seem like an option. You upend how things are\ndone with an unexpected approach: Facts can\u2019t be changed\u2014but problems can be\nsolved. The challenge to overcome is force of habit. Customers will have to\nchange their current behaviors, and inertia is powerful. You need an approach\nthat\u2019s novel enough, for a problem that matters enough, to be worth making a\nchange.\n\n### Future Vision\n\nYou enable a new reality through visionary innovation. It sounds like science\nfiction to customers, either because the concept is familiar but sounds\nimpossible (like abundant cheap energy from nuclear fusion) or because no one\never imagined it (like the iPhone). Customers are not only not trying to solve\nthe problem, they are either oblivious to it or predisposed to think it\u2019s a\npipe dream. Either way, the obstacle is disbelief: Customers must believe that\nyour product represents a whole new paradigm\u2014often with its own ecosystem.\n(The iPhone wasn\u2019t just a device; its App Store was a new way of interfacing\nwith the internet. Tesla isn\u2019t just a car; it\u2019s a network of cameras and self-\ndriving software that\u2019s a new driving experience.) Customers must find the\nparadigm and its possibilities irresistible. As we\u2019ll discuss below, this path\nis often long, and finding the right route with the right commercial\nopportunities along the way is usually critical.\n\n## How to Operate in Each Path\n\nOnce you understand these archetypes, you can self-identify which path your\ncompany is on. Many founders we encounter in Arc assume they\u2019re supposed to be\nin the Hair on Fire path. They have absorbed the adage to listen to what\ncustomers need. That\u2019s good advice. But it often comes as a revelation that\nHard Fact or Future Vision dynamics are viable options for finding PMF.\n\nHopefully you\u2019re already working on a problem you have a unique advantage in\nsolving. Your path, however, will be defined by how your customer relates to\nthis problem (and how they feel about your solution). You can find success on\nany path\u2014but each brings a distinct set of operating priorities that are\nessential to understand.\n\n### Path 1 \u2013 Hair on Fire\n\nThe Hair on Fire path requires both a great product and a great go-to-market\neffort\u2014in quick succession. This combination of solution, selling and speed is\nthe key to overcoming the competition.\n\n### Hair on Fire \u2013 Case Studies\n\nAlong with product velocity, one hallmark of companies that break through to\nfind success in the Hair on Fire path is the ability to aggressively out-\nmaneuver the competition.\n\nAssaf Rappaport and his Wiz co-founders had previously founded Adallom\ntogether. For their new company, they were intrigued by the problem of cloud\ninfrastructure security\u2014but it was already a crowded space with incumbents\nlike Palo Alto Networks and startups like Orca Security offering products on\nthe market. However, when they interviewed CISOs, the topic kept surfacing at\nthe top of everyone\u2019s wish list. There was evident demand in a large\nmarket\u2014but it took some digging to find the opportunity for differentiation.\nMost cloud security products relied on agents, a piece of software that needs\nto be installed in every server in order to monitor it. Wiz conceived an\n\u201cagentless\u201d solution that not only reduced friction and headaches, but\nsurfaced vulnerabilities more effectively. Even better, once connected it\ncould surface those vulnerabilities in the course of a 15-minute customer\ndemo. Assaf and his team found their advantage, and floored the accelerator,\naggressively out-maneuvering the competition: engineers built the product\nduring their workday Israel time, and worked double-duty as sales reps at\nnight\u2014daytime in the U.S. They went from $0 to $2.8M in a single quarter and\nreached $100M in ARR in 18 months, setting a new record for the fastest-\ngrowing software company, ever.\n\nWhen Parker Conrad founded Rippling, he was entering a large Hair on Fire\nmarket. Every company needs HR software, and this urgency was reflected in the\nsteep competition: there were already at least half a dozen incumbents\nfighting for market share. In fact one of them was Parker\u2019s own previous\ncompany Zenefits. Why bother? Because his deep expertise meant he knew what\nneeded to be done differently: While other providers stitched together\ndisparate datasets to offer a single platform for HR and benefits, Rippling\u2019s\napproach was to build a unified database. This foundation layer for employee\ndata could then \u201cripple\u201d out to any aspect of the employee experience, from\nbenefits to expenses to device management. Their technical advantage created a\ndifferent experience for HR, finance and IT administrators, which allowed\nRippling to stand out and quickly grow market share in a field of incumbents.\nAnd their strategy of bundling the widest set of employee experiences gave it\npricing power even in a Hair on Fire dynamic where price leverage can be\nchallenging for new entrants.\n\n### Path 2 \u2013 Hard Fact\n\nThe Hard Fact path entails getting customers to re-evaluate and change the way\nthey approach a current process. This requires first educating the market, and\nthen capturing the opportunity.\n\n### Hard Fact \u2013 Case Studies\n\nYour novel approach may replace an existing market (like Salesforce moving CRM\nto the cloud) or it may create a new market (like Uber reimagining the taxi\nexperience as a rideshare marketplace). Either way, you will likely face less\ncompetition on the Hard Fact path because the difficulty of changing the\nstatus quo has discouraged other founders from taking on the problem. To\nsucceed, Uber had to not only convince legions of everyday people to drive\nstrangers around, but also engage with taxi unions, local regulations and\nlabor laws. Others\u2019 natural aversion to such difficulty means you\u2019ll likely\nget more of a greenfield opportunity.\n\nWhen Block (then Square) first launched, the hard fact they were addressing\nwas widely known and acknowledged: \u201ccash only.\u201d For many small businesses or\nat any farmers\u2019 market, there was no way to accept credit cards. Consumers\nwould trudge off to find ATMs and merchants would often miss out on sales.\nJack Dorsey and Jim McKelvey\u2019s unique insight was that smartphones, which were\njust becoming ubiquitous, could be effectively turned into mobile credit card\nterminals. Square realized that this supposed hard fact of life was actually a\nhard problem that it could solve. But finding success meant getting the world\nto see it no longer had to live with this pain point, and to trust Square\u2019s\nsolution enough to adopt their new way. In order to activate this epiphany and\nwin over early adopters who would evangelize the product, Square made an early\ndecision to give its hardware and software away for free to merchants and\nfigure out a business model later. Eventually, Square became a new standard.\n\nIn 2006, marketing mainly consisted of advertising, mailers and telemarketing.\nThis put small businesses at a disadvantage, as these were all high-cost\nchannels. Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah realized there was a new way: small\ncompanies could leverage the properties of the fast-maturing internet\u2014blogs,\nsocial media, SEO, email newsletters\u2014to reach audiences at a fraction of the\ncost of traditional channels. HubSpot\u2019s suite of content, SEO and email\nmanagement tools solved this problem for customers. But in order for customers\nto believe in their approach and begin adopting their product, HubSpot needed\nto crystalize the new way in customers\u2019 minds\u2014to make them aware that the old\nway was broken and could be replaced with something better. They did this by\ncoining a term for their new way\u2014\u201cinbound marketing\u201d\u2014 and even wrote a book\nabout it. They were so effective at educating the market that the idea caught\non and started a marketing revolution in the small business world, propelling\nHubSpot to product-market fit and beyond.\n\n### Path 3 \u2013 Future Vision\n\nThe Future Vision path has the most ways to fail and the fewest to succeed,\nbut potentially the largest payoff. Taking this path requires endurance and\nthe ability to attract and retain top talent for the long haul.\n\n### Future Vision \u2013 Case Studies\n\nPhilosopher S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard said, \u201cLife can only be understood by looking\nbackward, but it must be lived looking forward.\u201d Future Vision founders like\nNvidia\u2019s Jensen Huang, who took a tortuous 30-year path to reach the company\u2019s\nfounding ambition, can probably relate.\n\nNvidia\u2019s initial vision was to uplevel what PCs are capable of with a 3D\ngraphics chip that would transform the experience of using a computer. When\nNvidia released its first chip, it was so ahead of its time that no one knew\nwhat to do with it. It took six years and three product lines to find product-\nmarket fit in an industry where the GPU enabled irresistible new\npossibilities: video games. While Nvidia\u2019s original ambition wasn\u2019t limited to\nthe video game industry, it became synonymous with gaming innovation, with its\nGPUs powering both PCs and Xboxes. Were it not for that very productive pit\nstop\u2014which propelled Nvidia to profitability and IPO\u2014the company never would\nhave survived long enough to power today\u2019s AI revolution. In fact, they were\nteetering on bankruptcy before finding PMF in gaming. Thirty years from its\nfounding, Nvidia is enabling a new computing paradigm as GPUs transform\neverything from data centers to cloud computing.\n\nFuture Vision products that fail to find PMF are often described as being \u201ctoo\nearly.\u201d For instance, 11 years after Google Glass launched, augmented reality\nstill hasn\u2019t gone mainstream. This is precisely why finding pit stops with\ncommercial traction along the way is so critical. Assuming your vision is\ncorrect and you can find a viable path, time is on your side with the Future\nVision archetype: You can amass an insurmountable headstart while the world\ncomes around to your paradigm. But finding the right pit stops can be\ndifficult. You must act with imperfect information\u2014\u201clive looking forward,\u201d as\nKierkegaard said\u2014and the pitfalls are always more obvious in hindsight.\nOftentimes finding the right path means embracing unexpected turns, both with\nthe technology you produce and the market you serve.\n\nOpenAI is one of the most interesting Future Vision stories of our time. Its\nvision is to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI)\u2014long considered a\npipe dream in technology circles\u2014and to do so for the benefit of humanity. To\nachieve this, they started as a non-profit, since the founders thought the\nprofit motive of a company would undermine their mission of human benefit. A\nfew years into the journey, however, they realized that the cost of compute\nneeded to innovate their large language models outstripped the fundraising\ncapacity of even the best-connected non-profit. Their path required a turn\ninto the for-profit sector. Adopting a more traditional startup structure\nbrought funding as well as expectations for product launches\u2014hence ChatGPT. It\ninstantly found product-market fit in the iPhone paradigm of \u201cI couldn\u2019t\nimagine wanting it until I saw it.\u201d Consumer demand for generative AI was\nnascent in 2022. In 2023, OpenAI generated $1.6B. While ChatGPT achieved the\nfastest adoption of any consumer technology product ever, for OpenAI it\u2019s the\npit stop they need on the way toward their real ambition.\n\n### Putting it All Together\n\nUsing the framework of these three paths\u2014and keeping in mind that one isn\u2019t\nbetter than the others\u2014you can reflect on your own product\u2019s place in the\nworld. What path are you on? How do customers relate to the problem you\u2019re\nsolving? Are you thinking about the right category dynamics? What are your\noperating priorities? Do you need to optimize for velocity and scale, land an\nepiphany with early adopters, or strategize the pit stops in your journey?\n\n### The Quest Continues\n\nPractice is always messier than theory, and as you apply this thinking in the\nreal world there are several important nuances to keep in mind:\n\nProduct-market relationship dynamics are fluid. Over time, many companies end\nup moving from one path to another as they introduce new products or as\ncustomer attitudes change about an existing product and underlying problem.\nSome companies straddle two paths at once. The point of this framework is not\nto irrevocably set your path in stone; it would be a mistake to identify\nyourself too narrowly with any one of them.\n\nApple, for instance, started as a Future Vision. The company\u2019s initial memo to\nSequoia in 1978 acknowledged that there was zero demand for household\ncomputers. \u201cApple management,\u201d it stated, \u201cbelieves that most potential\ncustomers of 1980 do not today have the slightest interest in purchasing a\nhome computer.\u201d As they captured imaginations and grew in popularity in the\n\u201980s, however, the category of personal computers was no longer a Future\nVision. By 1998, with the launch of iMac, Apple addressed a Hard Fact:\ncomputers, while increasingly ubiquitous, were impersonal. The iPhone\ninstantly found PMF as a Future Vision when Steve Jobs unveiled it in 2007.\nThe smartphone category then quickly shifted to Hair on Fire dynamics and a\nflood of new smartphones entered the market. Apple managed to retain its\ndominance by defining the category, being right and continuing to innovate.\nToday, Apple is introducing yet another Future Vision with Apple Vision Pro.\nThe device leverages the 10X advancements in sensors developed for the iPhone:\nthe fruits of one product\u2019s PMF journey can create seeds for the next. Will\nApple Vision Pro enable entirely new experiences we can\u2019t yet imagine, and\nfall squarely in the Hair on Fire path a few years from now? Time will tell.\n\nLegendary companies string together multiple product lines that evolve through\none path of product-market fit to another. While one product may plateau, the\nnext product starts rising.\n\nYou can use this framework to orient yourself regardless of where you are in\nthis cycle. PMF may seem like a destination you\u2019re trying to reach\u2014but keeping\nand expanding on it once you arrive is an ongoing quest that will last as long\nas your company does.\n\n## Share\n\nShare this via email\n\nJOIN OUR MAILING LIST\n\n# Get the best stories from the Sequoia community.\n\nBy navigating this website you agree to our cookie policy.\n\n\u00a9 2024 Sequoia Capital\n\n", "frontpage": false}
