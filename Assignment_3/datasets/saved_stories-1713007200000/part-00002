It is a memory bias whereby a person may falsely recall generating a\nthought, an idea, a tune, a name, or a joke;^[1] they are not deliberately\nengaging in plagiarism, but are experiencing a memory as if it were a new\ninspiration.\n\n## Early use[edit]\n\nCryptomnesia was first documented in 1874, involving the medium Stainton\nMoses, who during a s\u00e9ance believed himself to be in spiritual contact with\ntwo brothers from India who had recently been killed. Despite the apparent\ncommunication, he was unable to ascertain any details which had not already\nbeen given in newspaper coverage of the story the week before. Researchers\nconcluded that Moses had read the story but forgotten that he had read it,\ninstead mistaking the partial memory for a message from the spirit\nworld.^[2]^[3]\n\nThe word was first used by the psychiatrist Th\u00e9odore Flournoy,^[4] in\nreference to the case of medium H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Smith (Catherine-\u00c9lise M\u00fcller) to\nsuggest the high incidence in psychism of \"latent memories on the part of the\nmedium that come out, sometimes greatly disfigured by a subliminal work of\nimagination or reasoning, as so often happens in our ordinary dreams.\"\n\nCarl Gustav Jung treated the subject in his thesis \"On the Psychology and\nPathology of So-Called Occult Phenomena\" (1902)^[5] and in an article,\n\"Cryptomnesia\" (1905),^[6] suggested the phenomenon in Friedrich Nietzsche's\nThus Spoke Zarathustra. The idea was studied or mentioned by G\u00e9za Dukes,\nS\u00e1ndor Ferenczi and Wilhelm Stekel as well as by Sigmund Freud in speaking of\nthe originality of his inventions.^[7]^[8] Jacques Lacan illustrated the\nadaptability of the concept in his formulation of the ego ideal (the \"ego\" as\nOther^[9]) in refashioning the \"case\" of Margarite Pantaine (Case of Aim\u00e9e).\nHer experiences of self-\"misrecognition\" provided a structure for Lacan's key\nsubsequent theories of The Symbolic and the mirror stage.^[10]\n\nThe word cryptomnesia is a compound of Greek cryptos (hidden, concealed,\nsecret) and mnesia (memory).\n\n## Experimental research[edit]\n\nIn the first empirical study of cryptomnesia, people in a group took turns\ngenerating category examples (e.g., kinds of birds: parrot, canary, etc.).\nThey were later asked to create new exemplars in the same categories that were\nnot previously produced, and also to recall which words they had personally\ngenerated. People inadvertently plagiarized about 3\u20139% of the time either by\nregenerating another person's thought or falsely recalling someone's thought\nas their own.^[11] Similar effects have been replicated using other tasks such\nas word search puzzles^[12]^[13] and in brainstorming sessions.^[14]\n\n## Causes[edit]\n\nCryptomnesia is more likely to occur when the ability to properly monitor\nsources is impaired. For example, people are more likely to falsely claim\nideas as their own when they were under high cognitive load at the time they\nfirst considered the idea.^[15] Cryptomnesia increases when people are away\nfrom the original source of the idea, and decreases when participants are\nspecifically instructed to pay attention to the origin of their ideas. False\nclaims are also more prevalent for ideas originally suggested by persons of\nthe same sex, presumably because the perceptual similarity of the self to a\nsame-sex person exacerbates source confusion. In other studies it has been\nfound that the timing of the idea is also important: if another person\nproduces an idea immediately before the self produces an idea, the other's\nidea is more likely to be claimed as one's own, ostensibly because the person\nis too busy preparing for their own turn to properly monitor source\ninformation. ^[citation needed]\n\n## Value[edit]\n\nAs explained by Carl Jung,^[16] in Man and His Symbols, \"An author may be\nwriting steadily to a preconceived plan, working out an argument or developing\nthe line of a story, when he suddenly runs off at a tangent. Perhaps a fresh\nidea has occurred to him, or a different image, or a whole new sub-plot. If\nyou ask him what prompted the digression, he will not be able to tell you. He\nmay not even have noticed the change, though he has now produced material that\nis entirely fresh and apparently unknown to him before. Yet it can sometimes\nbe shown convincingly that what he has written bears a striking similarity to\nthe work of another author \u2014 a work that he believes he has never seen.\"\n\nJorge Luis Borges's story, \"Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote,\" is a meta-\nfictive enactment of cryptomnesia. This work is written in the form of a\nreview or literary critical piece about (the nonexistent) Pierre Menard. It\nbegins with a brief introduction and a listing of all of Menard's work.\n\nBorges's \"review\" describes this 20th-century French writer who has made an\neffort to go further than mere \"translation\" of Don Quixote, but to immerse\nhimself so thoroughly as to be able to actually \"re-create\" it, line for line,\nin the original 17th century Spanish. Thus, \"Pierre Menard\" is always used to\nraise questions and discussion about the nature of accurate translation or, in\nthis case, the hermeneutics of cryptomnesia.\n\n## Cases[edit]\n\n### Nietzsche[edit]\n\nJung gives the following example in Man and His Symbols.^[17] Friedrich\nNietzsche's book Thus Spoke Zarathustra includes an almost word for word\naccount of an incident also included in a book published about 1835, half a\ncentury before Nietzsche wrote. This is considered to be neither purposeful\nplagiarism nor pure coincidence: Nietzsche's sister confirmed that he had\nindeed read the original account when he was younger, likely sometime between\nages 12 and 15; Nietzsche's youthful intellectual capabilities, his later\ncognitive degeneration, and his accompanying psychological deterioration\n(specifically, his increasing grandiosity as manifested in his later behavior\nand writings) together strengthen the likelihood that he happened to commit\nthe passage to memory upon initially reading it and later, after having lost\nhis memory of encountering it, assumed that his own mind had created it.^[18]\n\n### Byron[edit]\n\nIn some cases, the line between cryptomnesia and zeitgeist (compare the\nconcept of multiple discovery in science) may be somewhat hazy. Readers of\nLord Byron's closet drama Manfred noted a strong resemblance to Goethe's\nFaust. In a review published in 1820, Goethe wrote, \"Byron's tragedy Manfred\nwas to me a wonderful phenomenon, and one that closely touched me. This\nsingular intellectual poet has taken my Faustus to himself, and extracted from\nit the strangest nourishment for his hypochondriac humour. He has made use of\nthe impelling principles in his own way, for his own purposes, so that no one\nof them remains the same; and it is particularly on this account that I cannot\nenough admire his genius.\"^[19] Byron was apparently thankful for the\ncompliment; however, he claimed that he had never read Faustus.\n\n### J.M. Barrie[edit]\n\nJ. M. Barrie, the creator of Peter Pan, was aware of the occurrence of\ncryptomnesia. In Peter and Wendy^[20] Wendy sews Peter's shadow back on and\nthis makes him very happy but he immediately thinks he has attached the shadow\nhimself:\n\n\"How clever I am,\" he crowed rapturously, \"oh, the cleverness of me!\"\n\nPeter exhibits a number of other clinically accurate peculiarities of memory\nsuggesting that Barrie regarded Peter's behavior as a memory disorder rather\nthan self-centredness.^[21]\n\n### Helen Keller[edit]\n\nHelen Keller compromised her own and her teacher's credibility with an\nincident of cryptomnesia which was misinterpreted as plagiarism.^[22] The\nFrost King, which Keller wrote out of buried memories of the fairy tale The\nFrost Fairies by Margaret Canby, read to her four years previously, left\nKeller a nervous wreck,^[citation needed] and unable to write fiction for the\nrest of her life.^[23]\n\n### Robert Louis Stevenson[edit]\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson refers to an incident of cryptomnesia that took place\nduring the writing of Treasure Island, and that he discovered to his\nembarrassment several years afterward:\n\n> ... I am now upon a painful chapter. No doubt the parrot once belonged to\n> Robinson Crusoe. No doubt the skeleton is conveyed from Poe. I think little\n> of these, they are trifles and details; and no man can hope to have a\n> monopoly of skeletons or make a corner in talking birds. The stockade, I am\n> told, is from Masterman Ready. It may be, I care not a jot. These useful\n> writers had fulfilled the poet's saying: departing, they had left behind\n> them Footprints on the sands of time, Footprints which perhaps another\u2014and I\n> was the other! It is my debt to Washington Irving that exercises my\n> conscience, and justly so, for I believe plagiarism was rarely carried\n> farther. I chanced to pick up the Tales of a Traveller some years ago with a\n> view to an anthology of prose narrative, and the book flew up and struck me:\n> Billy Bones, his chest, the company in the parlour, the whole inner spirit,\n> and a good deal of the material detail of my first chapters\u2014all were there,\n> all were the property of Washington Irving. But I had no guess of it then as\n> I sat writing by the fireside, in what seemed the spring-tides of a somewhat\n> pedestrian inspiration; nor yet day by day, after lunch, as I read aloud my\n> morning's work to the family. It seemed to me original as sin; it seemed to\n> belong to me like my right eye ...^[24]\n\n### Jerusalem of Gold[edit]\n\nJerusalem of Gold (\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05e9\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd \u05e9\u05dc \u05d6\u05d4\u05d1) is a 1967 song by Naomi Shemer. Some of the\nsong's melody is based on a Basque lullaby, Pello Joxepe,^[25] composed by\nJuan Francisco Petriarena 'Xenpelar' (1835\u20131869). Shemer heard a rendition by\nSpanish singer/songwriter Paco Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, who visited Israel in 1962 and\nperformed the song to a group that included her and Nehama Hendel. She later\nacknowledged hearing Hendel perform Pello Joxepe in the mid-1960s, and that\nshe had unconsciously based some of the melody on the lullaby. Shemer felt\nvery bad when she found that it was similar to Pello Joxepe, but when Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez\nwas asked how he felt about the issue, he replied he was \"glad it helped in\nsome way\", and that he was not angry, nor did he perceive it as\nplagiarism.^[26]\n\n### Steven Tyler[edit]\n\nIn 1984, when Aerosmith were recording Done With Mirrors, lead singer Steven\nTyler heard the group's \"You See Me Crying\" on the radio and, not remembering\nthat it was their own song, suggested that the group record a cover version,\nto which guitarist Joe Perry replied, \"That's us, fuckhead!\".^[27]\n\n### George Harrison[edit]\n\nThe precedent in United States copyright law, since 1976, has been to treat\nalleged cryptomnesia no differently from deliberate plagiarism. The seminal\ncase is Bright Tunes Music v. Harrisongs Music,^[28] where the publisher of\n\"He's So Fine,\" written and composed by Ronald Mack, demonstrated to the court\nthat George Harrison borrowed substantial portions of his song \"My Sweet Lord\"\nfrom \"He's So Fine.\" The Court imposed damages despite a claim that the\ncopying was subconscious. The ruling was upheld by the Second Circuit in ABKCO\nMusic v. Harrisongs Music,^[29] and the case Three Boys Music v. Michael\nBolton,^[30] upheld by the Ninth Circuit, affirmed the principle.\n\n### Colleen McCullough[edit]\n\nIn 1987, Australian author Colleen McCullough published a novella, The Ladies\nof Missalonghi. Critics alleged that she had plagiarised The Blue Castle, a\n1926 novel by L. M. Montgomery. McCullough acknowledged having read\nMontgomery's works in her youth, but attributed the similarities to\nsubconscious recollection.^[31]\n\n### Umberto Eco[edit]\n\nIn Interpretation and Overinterpretation, Umberto Eco describes the\nrediscovery of an antique book among his large collection, which was eerily\nsimilar to the pivotal object in his novel The Name of the Rose.\n\n> I had bought that book in my youth, skimmed through it, realized that it was\n> exceptionally soiled, and put it somewhere and forgot it. But by a sort of\n> internal camera I had photographed those pages, and for decades the image of\n> those poisonous leaves lay in the most remote part of my soul, as in a\n> grave, until the moment it emerged again (I do not know for what reason) and\n> I believed I had invented it.^[32]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Anybody Seen My Baby?\n  * Automatic writing\n  * Bridey Murphy\n  * Confabulation\n  * D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\n  * False memory\n  * Hindsight bias\n  * Jamais vu\n  * Joke theft\n  * Melancholy Elephants\n  * Minority influence\n  * Misattribution of memory\n  * Revelation\n  * Source amnesia\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Taylor, F..K.

Upon investigation, it was discovered that one week prior to the s\u00e9ance, their obituary had appeared in the newspaper. This was of some importance because Moses's communications with the two spirits contained nothing that wasn't already printed in the newspaper. When the spirits were pressed for further information, they were unable to provide any. Researchers concluded that Moses had seen the obituary, forgotten it, and then resurfaced the memory during the s\u00e9ance.\"\n  3. ^ Robert Todd Carroll (2014). \"Cryptomnesia\".

The piece of text \"secretly crept up and reproduced itself\" in \"Of Great Events\" (Z 2). Jung recognized the story about seamen stopping on an island to hunt rabbits, having read it in his grandfather's library. He wrote Elisabeth Forster-Nietzsche, who confirmed that she and Nietzsche had read the same book in their grandfather's library, when Nietzsche was eleven. This, Jung informed his Zarathustra seminar, \"shows how the unconscious layers of the mind work.\" He added, \"the absolute parallel is of course formed by the rabbits\" (1218).\"\n  19. ^ Reprinted in Lord Byron: The Critical Heritage by Andrew Rutherford [1]\n  20. ^ Barrie, J.
