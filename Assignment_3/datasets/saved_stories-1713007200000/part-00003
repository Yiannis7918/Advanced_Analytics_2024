Think of it as an LLM, but rather than predicting\nthe next word, we predict the next chess move the player will make. The model\nis run right in your browser, so it may take a moment to load. We don't need\nto send any moves back to the server.\n\nOn top of the machine learning model, we have developed the CHESSMATE\nalgorithm (Calculated HEuristic Strategy and Statistical Modeling of\nAnticipated Tactical Engagements) which uses its predictions to play the best\nmove against the model. This algorithm can trick you into playing a bad move\nto beat you quickly. In other words, Stockfish (a strong chess engine) will\ntry to beat you in 70 moves, but our algorithm tries to beat you in half the\ntime with riskier moves.\n\nThe machine learning model should run in less than a second, but the CHESSMATE\nalgorithm may take a few seconds due to a high number of Stockfish\ncalculations.\n\nModel status: loading\n\n# custom start position\n\n# settings\n\nplay model only\n\nTurns off the CHESSMATE algorithm and uses the raw outputs of the model\ninstead.\n\ncustom model\n\nIf you have a custom model, you can paste its name here.\n\ntop p\n\nTop P pruning to use in CHESSMATE algorithm.
