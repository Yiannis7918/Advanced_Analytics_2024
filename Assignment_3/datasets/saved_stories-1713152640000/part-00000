Hairy-nosed otters, smooth-coated otters, large-\nspotted civets, long-tailed macaques and fishing cats, as well a wide range of\nbat species, were among the residents recorded by the survey, which was funded\nby the conservation group Fauna & Flora International. The variety of wildlife\nhas staggered biologists.\n\nSmooth-coated otters in the mangroves. Photograph: Fauna & Flora/FCEE\n\n\u201cWe found 700 different species in these mangrove forests but we suspect we\nhave not even scratched the surface,\u201d said Stefanie Rog, the leader the survey\nteam, whose report is published on Sunday. \u201cIf we could look at the area in\neven greater depth we would find 10 times more, I am sure.\u201d\n\nmap\n\nMangrove forests form narrow strips of tangled, wooded land on coasts in\ntropical and subtropical latitudes. They are important because they are made\nup of trees that have adapted to grow in salt or brackish water, which most\nother plants cannot tolerate. However, over the past few decades, the planet\nhas lost about 40% of its mangroves, which have often been chopped down to\nmake way for beach resorts or agriculture.\n\nYet mangroves play critically important roles in protecting the land and its\ninhabitants. Their waters provide nurseries for commercially important fish,\nfor example. \u201cWe found young barracudas, snappers and groupers in the waters\nhere,\u201d said Rog. \u201cThey are clearly important breeding places for fish and\nprovide local communities with food as well as providing stock for commercial\nfisheries.\u201d\n\nMangroves also protect inland areas from tsunamis and storms, trap carbon far\nmore efficiently than other types of woodland, and act as refuges for a\nstunning array of animals, as the new study revealed through its extensive use\nof camera traps, nets, fish and insect estimates, and \u201ctransect\u201d surveys \u2013\nstudies conducted along a straight line drawn through the landscape.\n\nA macaque monkey in Tanjung Puting national park. Photograph: Juan Pablo\nMoreiras/Juan Pablo Moreiras/Fauna & Flora\n\nA key example of the strange species found in the Cambodian mangroves is the\nfishing cat, Prionailurus viverrinus. Slightly larger than a domestic breed,\nit is powerfully built, with short limbs and a stocky body, and \u2013 unlike most\nother cats \u2013 is happy to swim. Its front toes are partially webbed and its\nclaws protrude, aiding its ability to catch prey, mainly fish and rats, which\nit stalks while hidden in mangrove roots.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very rare to see a fishing cat and we have only found out that they are\nin the forest from the photographs taken by our camera traps,\u201d said Rog.\n\n\u201cMangroves are places of roots and mud and they are difficult for humans to\nget into, which is why they provide precious sanctuaries for these vulnerable\nanimals.\u201d\n\nAn even rarer animal, the hairy-nosed otter, was also photographed by camera\ntraps in some of the older parts of the mangrove forest. Lutra sumatrana uses\nhairs around its nose to detect its prey, which is made up of crustaceans,\nmolluscs and other creatures.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Observed\n\nFree weekly newsletter\n\nAnalysis and opinion on the week's news, culture and stories brought to you by\nthe best Observer writers\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

Photograph: FFI R5/Steph Baker/Fauna\n& Flora\n\nIt is the rarest otter in Asia and on the verge of extinction \u2013 and that is an\nissue of real concern, said Rog. \u201cA mangrove forest relies on all the\ninterconnected relationships between species and if you start taking away some\nof those species, then slowly you will lose the functioning of the forest.\u201d\n\nThe survey \u2013 which was also supported by the Fishing Cat Ecological\nEnterprise, a conservation group \u2013discovered 74 species of fish living in the\nforests\u2019 waters, as well as 150 species of birds, of which 15 are listed as\nnear-threatened or endangered on the International Union for Conservation of\nNature (IUCN) red list.\n\nScientists say that mangroves play a key role in preserving ecosystems because\nthey act as two-way barriers between the land and the sea. They slow soil\nerosion into the ocean and protect coastal communities from flooding and\nstorms.\n\n\u201cBut it goes further than that,\u201d added Rog. \u201cMangrove forests are beautiful,\nrich, mysterious, and harvest so much life.\n\n\u201cThey are so much more than just an ecosystem that provides a carbon-saving\nservice or coastal protection. They are actually beautiful in their own right.\nFor me, there is no better feeling than to be in this unique, mythical forest,\nknowing there is still so much more to explore \u2013 that there is another world\nwaiting for further discovery.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Endangered habitats\n  * The Observer\n  * Conservation\n  * Wildlife\n  * Cambodia\n  * Asia Pacific\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Environment\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Wildlife\n  * Energy\n  * Pollution\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
