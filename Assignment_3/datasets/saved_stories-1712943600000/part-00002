Big airplay. Mainstream.\nDid people not hear the words? Had the system already built gridded apartments\nover the whole punk landscape before I showed up? I wish tattoos still made\nyou unemployable. Then I\u2019d get some.\n\n> That I don\u2019t ever wanna be like you I don\u2019t wanna do the things you do I\u2019m\n> never gonna hear the words you say And I don\u2019t ever wanna, I don\u2019t ever\n> wanna be you \u2013 The Anthem, Good Charlotte\n\nThis song goes on to denounce college and real jobs. Where are you kids today?\nWhat you drop out like Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg. Drop out in pursuit of\nmore system granted status and wealth. Fuck you. Entrepreneurs following the\nVC lesson plan. YOU ARE PART OF THE SYSTEM. YOU ARE NOT INNOVATING. YOU ARE\nJUST UNDERPAID RESEARCH DIVISIONS OF BIG TECH COMPANIES.\n\nIt is beyond sad to me what has happened to tech. The bulldozers came a while\nago. They moved slow, but their eradication is almost complete. Gentrifying\npieces of shit, making technology safe for the professional managerial class.\nThey have left a few Hutongs for posterity, but gave them big brightly colored\nsigns to point them out. They are now the most photographed barn in America.\n\nIs my struggle against them pointless? Am I in a low budget Truman Show\nbubble, where the poured concrete is already totally encircling but there\u2019s a\nset backdrop in the way so I can\u2019t see it. When will the boat crash?\n\nIt\u2019s all optimization landscapes.\n\nThe modern state doesn\u2019t need a Goebbels. There\u2019s a little Goebbels inside\nevery - with a reddit account. So it\u2019s not the Truman Show, because there\u2019s no\nChristof. We are all doing this to ourselves. It\u2019s a decentralized cultural\nrevolution.\n\nAyn Rand saved the highest disdain for the professor. The epitome of human\nevil, the \u201cman who knew better\u201d, one who had great promise but squandered it\nfor social approval.\n\nYou know who you are. It\u2019s not too late to make a different choice.\n\nAnd my real hope is that tech doesn\u2019t work when you subject it to these\nconditions. Let\u2019s see who wins self driving cars. If they win, it\u2019s likely\nover. The future belongs to them and the only hope is to run. (they are the\ncentralized, we are the decentralized)\n\nBut perhaps they can only build 737 MAXes, and legit kids in their garages\nwill build good flying cars not for any reason but because they can, and well,\nmaybe to try to impress a girl. Then we\u2019ll be okay.\n\n> K: Yo text me I\u2019ll pick you up in my flying car. G: You know you could make\n> a lot of money if you partnered with...
