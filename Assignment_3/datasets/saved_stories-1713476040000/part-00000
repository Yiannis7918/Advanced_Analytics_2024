Though growth was slower than we hoped,\nwe\u2019ve made several important adjustments to our business that we believe will\nposition us for a strong rebound in the second half of the year. We started to\nexecute on our new plans last month, and we\u2019ve already had more promising\nconversations (three) with prospects and partners than I can count. Our new\nsmall-but-mighty team is energized to keep building, and to fulfill our\nmission of helping every player be a player for life.\n\n##\n\nWhat is PlayerCoach? + strategy update\n\nWhen we founded PlayerCoach, our original vision was to build an AI coach that\nwould turn 10x engineers into 10x managers. Though we quickly found strong\nproduct-market fit\u2014over the last year, dozens of developers asked our AI\nexperts hundreds of questions about how to be better managers\u2014these users\u2019\nemployers failed to want to buy. After talking with several customers and\ndoing the Five Whys while on a truckload of ketamine (thank you to our friends\nat Founders Fund for the intro to ATAI!), we realized that we were\nunderestimating the productive potential of AI, and that our vision wasn\u2019t big\nenough.\n\nStarting last month, we refocused the company on a new ambition: Not to train\nhuman managers, but to replace them. Rockstar engineers don't want to be\nrockstar managers; they want to keep being rockstar engineers. But they get\npulled into management, to help coach other employees. For engineering teams,\nit\u2019s a catch-22: To scale your best talent, you have to sacrifice it.\n\nWith PlayerCoach, companies will no longer have to make this choice. Customers\ncan tell us who their best engineers are, and for each one, we train a custom\nAI agent on an extensive catalog of managerial training resources and on that\nengineer\u2019s individual body of work.1 These bots can then operate as autonomous\nmanagers: They run one-on-ones, provide regular feedback, complete performance\nevaluations, and even conduct interviews and employee terminations.\n\nWith this new direction, our goal is to make the Peter Principle obsolete:\nHigh performers should get promoted to their level of expertise, and\nPlayerCoach will take care of the rest.\n\nWe believe that this could be a category-defining business. Devin, a startup\nthat aims to replace junior engineers, is already worth $2 billion. We are\naiming even higher, and want to replace engineering managers, who make 80\npercent more than junior engineers. Moreover, ChatGPT believes that our TAM is\n$800 trillion, growing at a CAGR of 200 percent.\n\nOur primary goal for 2024 is to execute on this new vision, hit our revenue\ntargets, and put ourselves in a strong position to raise a funding round by\nthe end of the year.\n\n##\n\nKey metrics\n\n####\n\nRevenue\n\nUp 1 percent this quarter (just under our target of 20 percent). We\u2019re\ndisappointed with this number, but I think it\u2019s misleading for a few reasons:\n\n  1. The Home Depot, our biggest Q1 deal, slipped into Q2. They\u2019re still on track to close, I promise, the Docusigns are out, it\u2019s just a couple administrative things, they will definitely get done, and actually, it\u2019s good they slipped, because we\u2019d offered them an end-of-quarter discount, they won\u2019t get that now, we should probably be glad they didn\u2019t close in Q1, if you think about it, because dollars are real but quarters are just a construct.\n\n  2. We adjusted how we calculate revenue so that we\u2019re no longer including verbal commitments to purchase not-yet-released products as annual recurring revenue. After talking with several industry leaders, we\u2019ve decided that these agreements are not, in any remote sense of the words, annual, recurring, revenue, or agreements. Though this bookkeeping adjustment will make our growth rate appear lower this quarter, please note that it\u2019s just an accounting change. It will also ensure that our sales team is focused on the right priorities going forward: Closing actual business,2 rather than securing non-binding letters of intent.\n\n  3. Churn was high this quarter, primarily because our two biggest customers, Monday.com and Fox Interactive, both declined to renew. However, they were both special cases, and they churned for reasons that weren\u2019t applicable to the rest of customer base. Monday.com was bought into the prior vision of PlayerCoach, and wasn\u2019t a good long-term fit for us. We believe it\u2019s actually positive that they churned, because it will enable us to fully focus on our new strategy. At Fox, the team using PlayerCoach was reorganized under a new department. Our champions told us that they\u2019d love to keep using us, if they could, but there was nothing they could do, just nothing at all. So we\u2019re confident that these two customers were outliers, and don\u2019t expect churn to be this high in future quarters.\n\nThat said, because \u201cBrave\u201d and \u201cTruth\u201d are two of our core values, we want to\nbe honest about this quarter\u2019s forecasts. Based on early conversations with\nour sales leaders, we think it would be best to bravely lower our growth\ntarget for Q2 from 22 percent to 5 percent.3\n\nThe good news is that we\u2019re still confident that we can hit our annual goals.\nWe know that the market will be excited about the new products we\u2019re shipping,\nand we expect to make up for the slower-than-planned growth in Q1 and Q2 with\nfaster growth in Q3 and Q4. Our finance team figured out a way to compound a\nbunch of individually-plausible-but-collectively-impossible assumptions into a\nfinancial model that says we\u2019ll grow by 6 percent this quarter, 30 percent in\nQ3, and 140 percent in Q4. We\u2019re confident in this plan.4\n\n####\n\nMarketing pipeline\n\nThe marketing team had its best quarter ever, bringing in 45 new leads and\nalmost $5 million in enterprise pipeline. These deals are still early, but\nwe\u2019ve had lots of very promising conversations and prospects are leaning in.\nFor example, just yesterday, we talked to Capital One, and they said they were\n\u201cnot interested\u201d\u2014so we now expect them to close as early as next month.\n\nWhile the cost of acquiring these leads was high, that\u2019s because we\u2019ve been\nexperimenting with new marketing campaigns to support our new vision and our\n2024 \u201centerprise-ready\u201d objective. As we all know, this is a process that\u2019ll\ntake a few months, a few quarters, maybe, maybe, a year. We expect costs to\ncome down considerably as we ship new features5 and refine our enterprise\nmarketing campaign.6\n\n####\n\nAdoption\n\nWe hit an all-time high in cumulative product signups this quarter. Active\nusers are also up 35 percent from Q4. Some of you asked if this is because we\nrecently adjusted our definition of \u201cactive\u201d to include anyone who interacts\nwith an email (clicks a link, opens the email, is sent an email, marks an\nemail as spam, etc.). We haven\u2019t had a chance to do the additional analysis\nnecessary to answer this question, but I\u2019ll have the team follow up soon.\n\n##\n\nProduct\n\nNo updates this quarter. Lots of good stuff coming soon though :-)\n\n##\n\nTeam\n\nWe unfortunately had to part ways with a handful of team members this quarter,\nand executed a 14 percent reduction in force.7 Though we have plenty of\nrunway, we believe that this rightsizing will help us remain lean and focused.\nIt also gives us more options as a business, because these cost savings put us\non a path to being profitable in 18 to 24 months, if we choose to take it.\n\nWe also had a team offsite last month. It was a very productive three days: We\nfinalized the 2022 financial plan, wrote down this year\u2019s OKRs on an Etch-a-\nSketch, hosted a customer panel, and ate way too many tacos :-). The team also\norganized a resume writing workshop for themselves, which is the sort of\nproactivity that defines the PlayerCoach family.\n\n##\n\nFinancial summary\n\n  * Cash on hand: $1,200, plus a $11.91 REI membership dividend and a $500 million term loan from Speedy Cash.\n\n  * Runway: 18 hours.\n\n  * Last quarter burn: $33 million, which includes one-off upfront AWS bill and expenses for the annual offsite (rental of Las Vegas Sphere for $31 million).\n\n  * Expected burn this quarter: $1,200, plus the purchase of a Black Diamond Mojo Chalk Bag and $315 million in debt servicing payments to Speedy Cash.8\n\n##\n\nAsks\n\nTo set ourselves up for our fundraise later this year, we\u2019ll be sharing our\nnew direction with outside investors soon. We\u2019re targeting a handful of top-\ntier firms initially, and I\u2019ll be in touch with each of you individually for\nintroductions to partners. Don\u2019t worry; we won\u2019t be wasting time by having\nconversations with proletarian associate plebes. Here\u2019s a quick blurb if you\nneed one:\n\n> PlayerCoach is the world\u2019s first autonomous engineering manager. All too\n> often, great engineers are asked to delve into management to \u201cscale\n> themselves\u201d for the broader engineering organization. PlayerCoach builds\n> custom AI agents that enables these engineers to be both managers and\n> developers at the same time.9 PlayerCoach\u2019s founding team has been delving\n> into this problem for over six years, and already has more than 50\n> customers, including Autodesk.10 Delve into more details at PlayerCoach.ai.\n\nWe'd also love your help spreading the word about our vision, so please share\non your socials! If you need ideas, these are a few of the new taglines that\nwe\u2019re using:\n\n  * You be the player, we\u2019ll be the coach.\n\n  * Players play. Let PlayerCoach coach.\n\n  * If you care about your people, don\u2019t make them care about people.\n\nFinally, as always, we would always appreciate introductions to great talent.\nThough we\u2019re continuing to hire across a number of roles, these are the key\npositions we\u2019re focused on this quarter:\n\n  * Rust engineers\n\n  * Senior brand designer\n\n  * Product marketing manager, with experience marketing technical products\n\n  * Literally anybody who works at OpenAI or Anthropic\n\n  * CEO\n\nLooking forward to a great 2024,\n\nBenn, CEO, PlayerCoach\n\nIf you spend enough time with early stage companies in Silicon Valley, you\u2019ll\nnotice that founders are often focused on making sure that their companies are\nwell-positioned to raise another funding round from venture capitalists. \u201cIf\nwe can get above a million in ARR this year,\u201d we\u2019d say, \u201cwe think that\u2019ll be\nenough to close a great series A.\u201d Or, \u201cwe need to double revenue this year\nwithout increasing our burn multiple, and that\u2019ll put us in a position to\nraise a series B.\u201d\n\nOn one hand, this makes some sense; in Silicon Valley, fundraising rounds are\nthe elementary school grade levels for startups. The occasional high-achievers\nmight skip one, but most of us have to pass through them sequentially. To\ngraduate from high school, you\u2019ve got to pass first grade, then second, up to\ntwelfth grade; to achieve the breakout success that most startups are chasing,\nthey have to raise a seed round, then an A, then a B, and so on. It makes\nsense to focus on what you need to do to pass the grade you\u2019re in, and worry\nabout the next one once you make it there.\n\nOn the other hand, this approach is a trap. Unlike elementary school students,\ncompanies don\u2019t start with a new slate every year. Nothing resets after they\nraise a round. If a struggling student crams for weeks before their end-of-\nyear exams and barely passes, they have all summer to rest before the next\nyear starts. If a surviving-but-not-thriving startup limps past a million\ndollars in revenue and closes their series A, they have to immediately turn\nthat same company into one making four to five million dollars in 24 months.\nBecause, as I\u2019ve said before, there is no step two. Whatever business gets a\nstartup to their A needs to get them to their B. Money gives them resources,\nbut it doesn\u2019t give them a new market, a new product, or a new idea. A failing\nchatbot is still a failing chatbot, with or without the backing of some guy\nnamed David or Scott.\n\nIn other words, startups shouldn\u2019t raise a round with the goal of spending\nthat money to hit whatever targets will get them to the next round. They\nshould raise money to test their idea. The goal of a seed round isn\u2019t be to\nraise a series A; it\u2019s to prove that the product and the company has a clear\npath to raising a series B, a series C, and beyond. If founder can close an A\nround, but can\u2019t escape the feeling that something will have to change to\nclose the eventual B, don\u2019t do the A.\n\nIn her book Quit, Annie Duke explains why Stewart Butterfield shut down\nGlitch, the company he founded before starting Slack:\n\n> They had just experienced their highest growth in new accounts, but he saw a\n> future where they would have to sustain [that same rate of] week-over-week\n> growth...for thirty-one weeks just to break even. And that was assuming the\n> new users they acquired were going to convert to paying customers at the\n> same historical rate, a pretty big assumption since it stood to reason that\n> the more eyeballs they got, the lower the quality those eyeballs would be.\n\nButterfield built a business that was passing its current grade, and could\u2019ve\neasily raised more money. But Glitch was unlikely to pass the grades that were\ncoming next. In those moments, it\u2019s deeply tempting to keep going\u2014to send the\nrosy investor updates, to build the optimistic financial models, to assume the\npivot will redefine the trajectory of the company, to think everything will be\ndifferent after you close this round\u2014but it\u2019s often wrong. Don\u2019t raise money\nbecause you won the last race; raise money because you\u2019re confident you can\nwin the next race.\n\n1\n\nWell, right now, we prompt GPT-3.5 with a link to Maker's Schedule, Manager's\nSchedule and the engineer\u2019s most recent 20 Slack messages, but we\u2019ll\neventually build custom agents on top of a proprietary LLM.\n\n2\n\nI mean, no, not exactly; we\u2019re also offering free services to design partners\nin exchange for testimonials. But social proof and gated case studies that get\ndownloaded three dozen times in six months will turn into money, right?\n\n3\n\nWe also need to lower it because Autodesk, our third biggest customer, is\nprobably going to churn at the end of the month. But they were oversold by a\ncavalier sales rep, are also going through a reorg, and our champion hasn\u2019t\nresponded to any of our emails in six months. Again, an unlucky and unique\nexception.\n\n4\n\nI.e., confident in our plan to eventually reclassify this year as \u201can\ninvestment year,\u201d and say we\u2019ll make up for the slow growth in 2024 with a\nbanger of a year in 2025.\n\n5\n\nI.e., an Okta integration.\n\n6\n\nI.e., host four dinners at a fancy restaurant.\n\n7\n\nLike every other startup, we were either exactly 10 to 15 percent too big, or\n10 to 15 percent has become the agreed-upon default for signaling that you\u2019re\ntough but not in trouble. Anything less and you\u2019re a weak-kneed coward who\ncan\u2019t make hard decisions; anything more and you\u2019re admitting that something\nhas gone horribly wrong. But 14 percent? It\u2019s prudent but not tentative;\ncourageous but not rash; steadying but not safe; serious, but not Serious.\n\n8\n\nWe know that our APR of 460 percent sounds high, but unfortunately, lower\nrates were a zero interest-rate phenomenon.\n\n9\n\nThis is the tricky part...the manager and the IC...at the same. time.\n\n10\n\nPlease don\u2019t include this customer after April 30.\n\n### Subscribe to benn.substack\n\nBy Benn Stancil\n\nA weekly Substack on data and technology, with some occasional conversations\nabout culture, sports, and politics.\n\n31 Likes\n\n31\n\nShare this post\n\n#### PlayerCoach.ai investor update \u2013 Q1 2024\n\nbenn.substack.com\n\n14\n\nShare\n\n14 Comments\n\nStephen PaceApr 12Liked by Benn StancilAbsolute gold.
