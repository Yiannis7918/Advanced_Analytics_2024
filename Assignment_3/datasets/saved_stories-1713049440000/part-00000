The project is built off of\nthe dwm tiling window manager and only installs a few basic packages. The last\ntime I updated it was with the release of 7.3, so it's been due for an minor\nrework.\n\nWhile making these minor changes, I remembered how incredibly easy the entire\ninstall process for OpenBSD is and how cozy the entire operating system feels.\nAll the core systems just work out the box. Yes, you need to \"patch\" in WiFi\nwith a firmware update, so you'll need an Ethernet connection during the\ninitial setup. Yes, the default desktop environment is not intuitive or ideal\nfor newcomers.\n\nBut the positives heavily outweigh the negatives (in my opinion):\n\n  * Incredibly secure operating system (No xz drama here...)\n  * Detailed documentation. Probably one of the best of any OS\n  * Much smaller codebase and small core team\n  * Complete operating system (kernel, userland utilities, libraries, applications combined)\n\nThese points might not seem important to others, but they are to me. Maybe\nyou're possibly interested in checking it out yourself? If you are, then read\non...\n\n## Try it Yourself!\n\nI've tried my best to write up a simplified, noob-friendly guide on both\nsetting up the core OpenBSD system, along with installing a simple dwm based\ndesktop environment. These are both focused on personal devices\n(laptops/computers), so if you're looking for server-specific setups you won't\nfind that here!\n\nYou can find both of those wiki-pages below:\n\n  * Installing OpenBSD\n  * Setting up a Desktop Environment for OpenBSD\n\nSome additional reading I highly recommend is: c0ffee.net/blog/openbsd-on-a-\nlaptop\n\nAdd a comment\n\nposts | Please Make Your Table Headings Sticky \u2192\n\nLast edited April 11, 2024 Created April 11, 2024 Powered by ikiwiki and\nFreeBSD\n\n", "frontpage": true}
