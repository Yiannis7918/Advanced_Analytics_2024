The increasing workforce growth rate reflects\nhigher hiring than attrition rates, even though both are on the decline.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f 40.4% of workers who started a new job in March transitioned to a new role\nand 67.9% transitioned to a new industry. Construction had the largest\nincrease in the share of workers coming from other industries.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f 1.6% increase in active job listings in March from February. The Education\nsector had the largest increase in the demand for workers (18.7% increase in\nactive listings in March), while Transportation had the largest decline in\nactive job postings (-5.5% decline in March).\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f 45.8 days to fill job openings in March. This is 1.2 days more than in\nFebruary and 1.8 days more than in March 2023.\n\n\u2b07\ufe0f 2.3% decrease in the number of employees notified of layoffs under the WARN\nAct compared to February 2024.\n\n### March\u2019s Jobs Report surpassed expectations again\n\nMarch\u2019s Jobs Report signals the continued strength of the labor market. The\nunemployment rate decreased slightly to 3.8%. The US economy added 303,000 new\njobs in March. Employment gains continue to be dominated by the Health care\nand Government sectors, which have been the main driver for job gains in the\npast few months.\n\nWhat does the granular workforce data from Revelio Labs have to say about the\nlabor market, and what do they signal about the labor market in the near\nfuture?\n\n### Declining hiring and attrition rates\n\nRevelio Labs\u2019 workforce intelligence data show that hiring and attrition rates\nhave continued their declining trend. The hiring rate stood at 15.8%\n(decreasing only slightly from the 15.9% hiring rate recorded in February).\nMeanwhile, the attrition rate stood at 13.6% (slightly lower than the rate of\n14.7% recorded in February). The workforce growth rate (difference between\nhiring and attrition rates) stood at 2.2% (higher than the growth rate in\nFebruary on a m.o.m basis).\n\nSectoral hiring and attrition saw some notable changes during March. Overall,\nmost sectors saw an increase in the growth rate compared to the growth rate in\nFebruary. Construction continues to lead the sectors in terms of having the\nhighest workforce growth rate (6.1% workforce growth in March compared to 6%\nin January). The exception to the workforce growth is in the Retail and\nLeisure and Hospitality sectors (Retail saw a growth rate of -1.1%, compared\nto -1.2% in February).\n\n### Of those who started who started a new job in March, 40.4% have\ntransitioned to different roles and 67.9% have switched industries\n\nUsing Revelio Labs extensive workforce data on millions of employee profiles\nin the US, we track workers\u2019 transitions between industries and occupations.\nOur analysis shows that 42.3% of workers who started a new job in September,\ndid so by also switching their broad job categories. This is less than the\n42.6% job category switch rate observed in August. Furthermore, 69.9% of\nworkers who started a new job in September, found their jobs in different\nindustries. Inflows from other industries can be interpreted as a sign of\nconfidence in the labor market. The consistent decline in the rate of\nswitching industries and job categories signals weaker opportunities for\nparticipants in the labor market since the beginning of 2023.\n\nThe left panel in the figure below shows the difference in the share of\nworkers who switched to a different industry relative to February 2024. The\nConstruction sector had a notable increase in the influx of workers from other\nindustries. 83.2% of workers who started a job in Construction in March came\nfrom other industries (+1.2 percentage points from the share in February). In\ncontrast, the Information sector experienced the largest decline in the share\nof workers joining the industry from other industries. 69.9% of workers who\nstarted a job in Information in March had backgrounds in other industries,\nrelative to 73.8% in February 2024 (a 3.9 percentage-point decrease).\n\nThe right panel shows the difference in the share of workers who started a new\njob in a different role relative to February 2024. Logistics roles exhibited\nthe largest increase in the share of workers transitioning from different\nroles compared to the previous month, while research and data analysis roles\nwitnessed the largest decline.\n\n### Job postings increase slightly more in March 2024\n\nThe active job postings index continued its modest uptrend that started in\nJanuary after 5 consecutive months of decline in job postings. Job listings\nincreased by 1.55% compared to the previous month. New job listings increased\nby 0.9% month-on-month, while removed job postings also increased by 10.4%\nfrom their level in February.\n\nThe increase in job listings in March was driven by a large increase in active\njob postings in the Education sector (18.7% increase in active postings\ncompared to February 2024). Meanwhile, the Transportation sector saw a 5.1%\ndecline in the number of active job listings in March. Interestingly, Science\nand design roles saw the largest increase in active job postings in March;\noperations and IT-related jobs saw a notable decline.\n\nThe days-to-fill for open listings has ticked up again after a sizable\ndecrease in February. Overall, average days-to-fill open positions continue on\nits increasing trend since Fall 2023. Average days-to-fill stood at 45.8 days\nin March, up from 44.6 days in February (+1.2 days). The general increase in\nthe number of days required to fill open job postings over the Fall and Winter\nquarters signals a move back towards a tightening labor market.\n\n### Layoffs continue to decrease\n\nThe number of employees receiving layoff notices under the WARN Act decreased\nin March, echoing a downward trend in the number of employees notified of\nlayoffs that started in the Summer of 2023. The number of layoffs remains\nelevated compared to 2022.\n\n### Quarterly highlight: Employee sentiment is at an all time low\n\nIn our previous research, we have shown that employee sentiment, particularly\nbusiness outlook sentiment, serves as a leading indicator for negative events\nin a company, such as mass layoffs or the crypto collapse. We analyze overall\naverage employee sentiment in the US. We find that both overall employee\nsentiment and business outlook sentiment have been continuously decreasing\nsince they peaked in March 2021. As of March 2024, overall rating is back to\nthe same level it was before the pandemic, while Business Outlook sentiment is\nat an all time low - lower than the pre-pandemic level. Low employee morale\ncan be indicative of companies' poor performance and culture, and can be an\nearly sign low productivity and high turnover.\n\n### Highlight of the Month: Women Are \u201cWonderful,\u201d Men Provide \u201cSolutions.\u201d\n\nIn our recent research, we highlight another gender gap: the gender gap in\nrecommendations from former employers and colleagues. Public recommendations\non professional profiles provide a positive signal to prospective employers,\nwhich translate in higher salaries on average. Revelio Labs\u2019 workforce data\nshow that there is a gender gap in recommendations. Not only do men have a\nhigher likelihood of having recommendations on their profile, but also the\ncontent of recommendations varies significantly between men\u2019s and women\u2019s\nprofiles, even after controlling for roles. Female engineers are most commonly\ndescribed as \u201corganized\u201d, and \u201cwonderful\u201d \u201cteam players,\u201d while men are often\nrecommended for being \u201ctechnical\u201d and \u201csolutions-oriented.\u201d\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe labor market continues to show remarkable strength at the end of the first\nquarter of 2024. While the hiring rate continues its downward trend, attrition\nis also decreasing at a faster rate, indicating heightened uncertainty among\nemployers and workers. The dynamics of hiring and attrition still leave the\nworkforce with a positive and stable growth rate. What is interesting to\nobserve in our analysis are the industry dynamics. The Information and Tech\nindustry saw the biggest decline in new workers starting jobs from outside the\nindustry, as can be expected post layoff rounds. For two months in a row,\nRevelio Labs\u2019 data shows that the Construction industry has experienced the\nfastest growth in workforce relative to all other industries. Job listings are\nalso increasing steadily in this sector. BLS data also shows that Construction\nhad a notable increase in job growth relative to last year, even amid the high\ninterest rates. It remains essential for employers to address the declining\nemployee sentiment and carefully design policies to boost employee morale, as\nthe declining employee morale can hurt productivity.\n\nPlease view our data and methodology for this job report here and our recent\nresearch on employee recommendations here.\n\n### Loujaina Abdelwahed\n\nSenior Economist\n\n## Latest Articles\n\nView all\n\nsocial\u20226 min read\n\nWill Your Mailman Become Your Dog's Best Friend?\n\nsocial\u20229 min read\n\nLiberal Arts Grads Are Supposedly Well-Rounded, But How's Their Pay?\n\n### Want more Revelio Labs?
