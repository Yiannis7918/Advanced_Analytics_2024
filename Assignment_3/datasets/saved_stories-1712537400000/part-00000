We release three versions of this model:\n\nModel Name| Description  \n---|---  \nh2oai/h2o-danube2-1.8b-base| Base model  \nh2oai/h2o-danube2-1.8b-sft| SFT tuned  \nh2oai/h2o-danube2-1.8b-chat| SFT + DPO tuned  \n  \nThis model was trained using H2O LLM Studio.\n\n## Model Architecture\n\nWe adjust the Llama 2 architecture for a total of around 1.8b parameters. For\ndetails, please refer to our Technical Report. We use the Mistral tokenizer\nwith a vocabulary size of 32,000 and train our model up to a context length of\n8,192.\n\nThe details of the model architecture are:\n\nHyperparameter| Value  \n---|---  \nn_layers| 24  \nn_heads| 32  \nn_query_groups| 8  \nn_embd| 2560  \nvocab size| 32000  \nsequence length| 8192  \n  \n## Usage\n\nTo use the model with the transformers library on a machine with GPUs, first\nmake sure you have the transformers library installed.\n\n    \n    \n    pip install transformers>=4.39.3\n    \n    \n    import torch from transformers import pipeline pipe = pipeline( \"text-generation\", model=\"h2oai/h2o-danube2-1.8b-chat\", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, device_map=\"auto\", ) # We use the HF Tokenizer chat template to format each message # https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/chat_templating messages = [ {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Why is drinking water so healthy?\"}, ] prompt = pipe.tokenizer.apply_chat_template( messages, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True, ) res = pipe( prompt, max_new_tokens=256, ) print(res[0][\"generated_text\"])\n\n## Quantization and sharding\n\nYou can load the models using quantization by specifying load_in_8bit=True or\nload_in_4bit=True. Also, sharding on multiple GPUs is possible by setting\ndevice_map=auto.\n\n## Model Architecture\n\n    \n    \n    MistralForCausalLM( (model): MistralModel( (embed_tokens): Embedding(32000, 2560, padding_idx=0) (layers): ModuleList( (0-23): 24 x MistralDecoderLayer( (self_attn): MistralAttention( (q_proj): Linear(in_features=2560, out_features=2560, bias=False) (k_proj): Linear(in_features=2560, out_features=640, bias=False) (v_proj): Linear(in_features=2560, out_features=640, bias=False) (o_proj): Linear(in_features=2560, out_features=2560, bias=False) (rotary_emb): MistralRotaryEmbedding() ) (mlp): MistralMLP( (gate_proj): Linear(in_features=2560, out_features=6912, bias=False) (up_proj): Linear(in_features=2560, out_features=6912, bias=False) (down_proj): Linear(in_features=6912, out_features=2560, bias=False) (act_fn): SiLU() ) (input_layernorm): MistralRMSNorm() (post_attention_layernorm): MistralRMSNorm() ) ) (norm): MistralRMSNorm() ) (lm_head): Linear(in_features=2560, out_features=32000, bias=False) )\n\n## Benchmarks\n\n### \ud83e\udd17 Open LLM Leaderboard\n\nBenchmark| acc_n  \n---|---  \nAverage| 48.44  \nARC-challenge| 43.43  \nHellaswag| 73.54  \nMMLU| 37.77  \nTruthfulQA| 39.96  \nWinogrande| 69.77  \nGSM8K| 26.16  \n  \n### MT-Bench\n\n    \n    \n    First Turn: 6.23 Second Turn: 5.34 Average: 5.79\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nPlease read this disclaimer carefully before using the large language model\nprovided in this repository.
