Four dogs is a lot of dogs. There are days I can\u2019t\nbelieve we\u2019ve done this. The barking, the fur, the dog toys, 16 paws pounding\nacross our floors.\n\nI\u2019ve come to believe that no one ever sets out and decides to have four dogs.\nIt\u2019s just something that happens to you. Mark my words, if you aren\u2019t careful,\nyou\u2019ll end up with four dogs too.\n\nWith this many animals in your life, it forces you to economize.You can\u2019t give\neach pooch a bespoke doggy experience. There\u2019s enough chaos as it is, you have\nto implement systems.\n\nOne of the systems we rely on is batching. Batching is a productivity method\nthat involves grouping similar tasks together to complete all at once. The\nbrain works best when it focuses on one thing at a time. We only have a\ncertain amount of cognitive capacity and a certain amount of attention.\nBatching helps you avoid multitasking and increases the amount of time you\nhave to focus on tasks.\n\nSo, what does batching look like with four dogs? One obvious example is when\nit comes to walking them. They get two walks a day, so we have to batch walk\nthe dogs or else we\u2019d do nothing but walk our neighborhood all day. So my wife\nand I take all four of them out at a time (of course, these days she\u2019s taking\ntwo out at a time because I broke my ankle).\n\nWhat else? They get meds all at once. They get fed all at once. Treats come in\none batch. We try and schedule vet visits for them all on the same day.\n\nI know this all is obvious. Of course this is how you\u2019d live life with this\nmany dogs. If that\u2019s the existence you've chosen.\n\nBut look at your own life: what could you economize by batching? Do you check\nyour email off and on throughout the day? Do you have meetings haphazardly in\nyour schedule? Do you prepare a new meal each night? You could do each of\nthese in batches as opposed to doing each one individually. By doing this, you\nreduce the mental load of shifting between different types of tasks, and\ncreate a workflow that allows for deeper focus and concentration.\n\n####\n\nHow It Works:\n\n  1. Identify and categorize your routine tasks into distinct groups\n\n  2. Allocate dedicated time blocks for each task category based on your peak productivity periods\n\nPros\n\n  * Reduces the cognitive load associated with task-switching, leading to increased focus.\n\n  * Saves time by consolidating preparation and process for similar tasks.\n\n  * Can improve quality of work by allowing for a deeper state of focus on similar tasks.\n\n  * Makes it easier to measure progress and maintain consistency across tasks.\n\nCons\n\n  * It can get boring. Like really boring. You can get tired of working on similar tasks for extended periods of time.\n\n  * Can be inflexible, making it difficult to handle urgent tasks that arise spontaneously.\n\n  * Not all tasks are conducive to batching, which limits the method\u2019s applicability.\n\n####\n\nWho It Works Best For\n\nBatching can be good for people who handle a variety of repetitive tasks, such\nas administrative professionals, writers, content creators, and customer\nservice representatives. It also benefits those who find that frequent task-\nswitching disrupts their productivity.\n\nAnd it\u2019s great if you\u2019ve lost your mind and filled your home with four dogs.\n\n##\n\nOn Leadership...\n\nI\u2019m not always the leader I want to be. Some days, I just want things done,\nand I want people to do them without needing to drive consensus, negotiate, or\nmanage tasks. I just want people to do all the things. So, I muster some\nenergy and motivation, enforce the systems we have in place, direct people, or\nsend off a Slack message or two about priorities and status.\n\nBut great leaders don't just manage; they inspire.\n\nThink of a person in authority from your life who truly affected you, who\nhelped you achieve more than you thought possible. These people possess\nsomething extra: they have a way of altering reality, making you believe you\ncan accomplish something extraordinary.\n\nThat\u2019s the type of leader I want to be: someone who not only gets things done\nand helps others do the same but also elevates people and fosters an\nenvironment where success is not just achieved but celebrated collectively.\nSo, today, I will explore five key behaviors I believe are found in the best\nleaders.\n\n###\n\nFive things great leaders do to inspire their teams\n\n  1. They recognize people\n\n  2. They emphasize purpose over profit\n\n  3. They practice self awareness\n\n  4. They are positive\n\n  5. They take the win\n\n###\n\nRecognition\n\n> \"Recognition is not a scarce resource. You can't use it up or run out of\n> it.\" \u2015 Susan M. Heathfield\n\nPeople generally like to be acknowledged for their work. When employees feel\nappreciated, they're more inclined to work well with others and communicate\neffectively. Building a culture that values recognition creates a supportive\natmosphere for the team. Plus, it doesn\u2019t cost much to give someone a shout-\nout for a job well done. Here are some easy ways to do that:\n\n  * Publicly acknowledge someone\u2019s work in a team meeting.\n\n  * Send a quick one-on-one note to say thanks.\n\n  * Create a shout-outs section in your company all-hands.\n\n  * Send a small gift or token of appreciation, like a gift card, book, or other personalized item.\n\n  * Create a formal recognition system with awards for specific achievements.\n\nFinally, great leaders adopt this policy: Take the blame and give away the\nfame. When things go wrong, a leader should assume responsibility and not\nshift the blame onto team members. Conversely, when things go right, a leader\nshould attribute the success to the team rather than taking personal credit.\n\n###\n\nPurpose Over Profit\n\n> \u201cIf you want to build a ship, don't drum up the men to gather wood, divide\n> the work and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and\n> endless sea.\" \u2015 Antoine de Saint-Exupery\n\nWe all know that companies want to make money and employees need to get paid\nfor their efforts. Yet, the difference between just doing a job and loving it\noften depends on the impact one feels they are making. Great leaders don't\njust focus on profits. They clearly outline their organization's values,\nvision, and purpose. These need to be clear in the leadership team's minds,\nand they need to be written down, displayed in the office, included in emails,\nand a natural part of day to day conversation.\n\nWe all get distracted, and that\u2019s not always bad, but regular reminders of our\ncompany's mission help us stay focused on our primary purpose.\n\n###\n\nSelf-Awareness\n\n> Metacognition in a nutshell is thinking about one's thinking. It\u2019s a form of\n> self-awareness that involves monitoring your own thinking, knowledge, and\n> performance.\n\nEveryone likes to think of themselves as a great listener. We may think we are\nsuper intelligent, considerate, or aware of our surroundings.\n\nBut, that\u2019s not always the case.\n\nThe most effective leaders recognize they don\u2019t have everything figured out.\nThey practice a little metacognition and avoid acting superior to others.\nBeing objective about ourselves and others is crucial. It helps us decide\nwhether to moderate our own behavior or to discuss someone else's behavior\nchange respectfully. In doing so, we can also recognize their abilities and\nunderstand their feelings. A little self-awareness goes a long way.\n\n###\n\nPositivity\n\n> \u201cBeing positive in a negative situation is not naive. It's leadership.\u201d \u2015\n> Ralph Marston\n\nAs a leader, it's critical to have a positive mindset to effectively work\nthrough difficult situations and keep your team on the same page.\n\nYou don't need to act like a cheerleader to give people hope or inspire them.\nOften being a positive leader means simply avoiding a negative mindset.\nNegativity can be poisonous in the workplace, lowering morale and\nproductivity, and spreading to others, which creates a bad atmosphere. Good\nleaders keep their thoughts positive. This helps them boost their team's\nmorale, especially when things get tough. Positivity is infectious and\nmotivating. Research shows that being happy and optimistic can improve\nperformance and success.\n\nLeading with positivity involves being open and possessing a significant\namount of emotional intelligence, but it\u2019s the best way to genuinely earn your\nteam's trust.\n\n###\n\nTake the Win\n\n> \u201cWhen we fail to acknowledge and celebrate small victories, we get\n> discouraged and the flame inside us starts to dwindle.\u201d \u2015 Unknown\n\nWe all have goals. We have big things to accomplish. Either individually or as\na team we have objectives to hit. But great leaders acknowledge the little\nwins along the way. They recognize (or create) milestones to reach along the\npath to a final destination.\n\nThese little wins may be small and quickly achieved, but they hold great\nsignificance. They are the initial successes that give a hint at future\nachievements. And when they are acknowledged by leadership, they reinforce the\nvalue of every team effort. This boosts morale, encourages commitment, and can\ntrigger a chain reaction of continued enthusiasm.\n\nIt's also so very important to genuinely appreciate these small wins without\ndiminishing their value or constantly focusing on future challenges. Don\u2019t\nundercut your achievements with thoughts of upcoming difficulties.\n\nIn conclusion, effective leadership is much more than strategic decision-\nmaking; it involves inspiring and nurturing your team's spirit. Great leaders\ncreate an environment of recognition and positivity.\n\nLike I said, I am not always the leader I want to be. But reviewing these\nprinciples will help keep me on track. I hope they help you too.\n\n##\n\nOn Gratitude...\n\nWhat are you thankful for today? For me, it's a cozy fire on a cloudy day, a\nquiet morning to write, my lovely wife, my amazing children, my terrible dogs.\nIt can feel onerous at times to catalog the things you are grateful for, but\nit only takes 2 minutes to do, and those 120 seconds can invigorate your\nentire day. So, I\u2019ll ask again: what are you thankful for today?\n\n### Subscribe to Chief Rabbit\n\nBy Derek Pharr \u00b7 Launched 2 months ago\n\nMy name is Derek. I get things done.
