The AI is designed to learn how best to respond to\nnuclear attacks but some wires get crossed and it starts wanting to play with\nreal nukes. The situation is defused when it finally figures out that there\nare no winners in a nuclear free-for-all and stops the launch sequence. The\ncomputer realized it was playing a sucker game; one that was set up in such a\nway that it could not win.\n\nSucker games are everywhere. Fortunately, most of them do not involve nukes\nbut the impact on lives can still be severe. Revenge feuds are a dramatic\nexample. One person hurts another leading to retaliation. The retaliation\nkicks off its own response, leading to an endless cycle of hurt benefiting no\none (except perhaps the lawyers involved). Another example is when people go\ndown a path that has ended poorly for pretty much everyone else that has taken\nthat route. The city of Las Vegas is pretty much built on a burial ground of\ndreams like this. Sucker games show up in business (\u201cI know he\u2019s done some\nshady stuff before but this opportunity is too good to pass up\u201d), at work\n(\u201cwe\u2019d like you to take responsibility for this can\u2019t-fail project even though\nwe won\u2019t give you the resources or time to get it done right\u201d) and in love\n(\u201cI\u2019m sure I can change him\u201d). Once you start looking out for them, you see\nthem everywhere.\n\nThanks for reading Panic Struck Nine!

Why\nrun headlong into a situation that is stacked against you? Is it just hubris?\nI think the primary way people get sucked in is by not realizing they have\nmade the first move. Imagine you are at a bar with your friends. You\naccidentally bump into some meathead. You\u2019re immediately apologetic but he\ndoes not stop shouting insults at you. You feel humiliated and start to get\nriled up by the unfairness of his reaction. You have a choice - yell back at\nhim or apologize and walk away. If you chose door number 1, welcome to the\nsucker game of a possible bar fight. If you lose, you get a black eye or\nworse. If you win, you spend the night in jail. Congratulations!\n\nSo how do you prevent getting into sucker games? The best case scenario is you\nhave time to think before getting into the scenario. A classic example is your\nboss offering you a high-risk critical project without adequate resources or\nsupport and nothing more than an attaboy and a hearty slap on the back. This\nis called being set up to fail. If you are dumb, you charge forward with\nnothing but grit and optimism and join the pile of corpses of those that have\ndied trying. If you are smart, you help your boss understand the risks and\nfigure out a plan to mitigate them. If your boss is unwilling to face up to\nthe challenges, then you figure out your plan to get out of that situation as\nquickly as possible. Thinking ahead is always a good way to anticipate and\nside step sucker games.\n\nYou should also get good at recognizing patterns. Have other people\nconsistently failed in the same manner doing this thing? If so, perhaps some\ncaution is called for. So often, people in the entertainment industry get rich\nand famous and then the \u201cfamous\u201d part starts to mess with them. They have\ndifficulty in relationships (\u201cdo they want me for me or what I can do for\nthem?\u201d) and their insecurities take on a new life. If you are trying to make\nit in show business, you should proactively spend some time figuring out your\nmental health given the well documented stresses that come with the industry.\nThere is a similar pattern with people in sports and finances (or lack thereof\nin their post-career lives). If you pay attention, you will spot the patterns\nfor the environment you are in regardless of whether you are a school teacher,\nstay at-home parent or rock-and-roll god.\n\nSo what happens if you find yourself already in a sucker game? What now? The\ngood news is that you recognize your predicament. You have looked at the path\nyou are on and realized it is not going to end well. The first rule of holes\nis that when you find yourself in one, stop digging. The hard part is\nrealizing that any new investment in that game is making you worse off and you\nneed to stop and change course right now. This takes effort and very often a\nsublimation of your ego. Sometimes what it takes is an apology, even when you\nare not totally wrong. Even the Good Book1 suggests that if you realize you\nare in a feud with someone, you are better off skipping church to find the\nperson and make amends. This is not to suggest becoming a doormat but also not\nto be driven by your ego, blind ambition or attachment to sunk costs.\n\nThe reality of life is you almost cannot avoid being drawn into a sucker game\nevery now and then. The best you can do is to reduce your exposure to them and\nreduce your time spent playing them. The more you practice, the better you\nwill get at spotting them and minimizing the damage they cause.\n\n\u201cA strange game. The only way to win is not to play.\u201d\n\n\\- WarGames (1983)\n\n1\n\nMatthew 5:23-24\n\n### Subscribe to Panic Struck Nine\n\nBy Tolu Akinola \u00b7 Launched 8 months ago\n\nThings I know to be true(ish)\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Sucker Games\n\ntoluakinola.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nHow to do idea discovery\n\nor finding great problems to solve\n\nDec 9, 2023 \u2022\n\nTolu Akinola\n\nShare this post\n\n#### How to do idea discovery\n\ntoluakinola.substack.com\n\nA simple online safety guide\n\nor how to stay safe on the internets\n\nDec 14, 2023 \u2022\n\nTolu Akinola\n\n1\n\nShare this post\n\n#### A simple online safety guide\n\ntoluakinola.substack.com\n\nHow to win the lottery\n\nor a framework to address luck in outcomes\n\nAug 19, 2023 \u2022\n\nTolu Akinola\n\nShare this post\n\n#### How to win the lottery\n\ntoluakinola.substack.com\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Tolu Akinola\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
