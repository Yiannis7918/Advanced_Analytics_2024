Neurons are still active during sleep. We may not\nrealize it, but the brain takes advantage of this recharging period to get rid\nof junk that was accumulating during waking hours.\n\nSleep is something like a soft reboot. We knew that slow brainwaves had\nsomething to do with restful sleep; researchers at the Washington University\nSchool of Medicine in St. Louis have now found out why. When we are awake, our\nneurons require energy to fuel complex tasks such as problem-solving and\ncommitting things to memory. The problem is that debris gets left behind after\nthey consume these nutrients. As we sleep, neurons use these rhythmic waves to\nhelp move cerebrospinal fluid through brain tissue, carrying out metabolic\nwaste in the process.\n\nIn other words, neurons need to take out the trash so it doesn\u2019t accumulate\nand potentially contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. \u201cNeurons serve as\nmaster organizers for brain clearance,\u201d the WUSTL research team said in a\nstudy recently published in Nature.\n\n## Built-in garbage disposal\n\nHuman brains (and those of other higher organisms) evolved to have billions of\nneurons in the functional tissue, or parenchyma, of the brain, which is\nprotected by the blood-brain barrier.\n\nEverything these neurons do creates metabolic waste, often in the form of\nprotein fragments. Other studies have found that these fragments may\ncontribute to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nThe brain has to dispose of its garbage somehow, and it does this through\nwhat\u2019s called the glymphatic system (no, that\u2019s not a typo), which carries\ncerebrospinal fluid that moves debris out of the parenchyma through channels\nlocated near blood vessels. However, that still left the questions: What\nactually powers the glymphatic system to do this\u2014and how? The WUSTL team\nwanted to find out.\n\nTo see what told the glymphatic system to dump the trash, scientists performed\nexperiments on mice, inserting probes into their brains and planting\nelectrodes in the spaces between neurons. They then anesthetized the mice with\nketamine to induce sleep.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeurons fired strong, charged currents after the animals fell asleep. While\nbrain waves under anesthesia were mostly long and slow, they induced\ncorresponding waves of current in the cerebrospinal fluid. The fluid would\nthen flow through the dura mater, the outer layer of tissue between the brain\nand the skull, taking the junk with it.\n\n## Just flush it\n\nThe scientists wanted to be sure that neurons really were the force that\npushed the glymphatic system into action. To do that, they needed to\ngenetically engineer the brains of some mice to nearly eliminate neuronal\nactivity while they were asleep (though not to the point of brain death) while\nleaving the rest of the mice untouched for comparison.\n\nIn these engineered mice, the long, slow brain waves seen before were\nundetectable. As a result, the fluid was no longer pushed to carry metabolic\nwaste out of the brain. This could only mean that neurons had to be active in\norder for the brain\u2019s self-cleaning cycle to work.\n\nFurthermore, the research team found that there were fluctuations in the brain\nwaves of the un-engineered mice, with slightly faster waves thought to be\ntargeted at the debris that was harder to remove (at least, this is what the\nresearchers hypothesized). It is not unlike washing a plate and then needing\nto scrub slightly harder in places where there is especially stubborn residue.\n\nThe researchers also found out why previous experiments produced different\nresults. Because the flushing out of cerebrospinal fluid that carries waste\nrelies so heavily on neural activity, the type of anesthetic used\nmattered\u2014anesthetics that inhibit neural activity can interfere with the\nresults. Other earlier experiments worked poorly because of injuries caused by\nolder and more invasive methods of implanting the monitoring hardware into\nbrain tissues. This also disrupted neurons.\n\n\u201cThe experimental methodologies we used here largely avoid acute damage to the\nbrain parenchyma, thereby providing valuable strategies for further\ninvestigations into neural dynamics and brain clearance,\u201d the team said in the\nsame study.\n\nNow that neurons are known to set the lymphatic system into motion, more\nattention can be directed towards the intricacies of that process. Finding out\nmore about the buildup and cleaning of metabolic waste may contribute to our\nunderstanding of neurodegenerative diseases. It\u2019s definitely something to\nthink about before falling asleep.\n\nNature, 2024.
