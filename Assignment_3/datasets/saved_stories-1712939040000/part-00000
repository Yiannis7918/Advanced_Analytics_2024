Several indie developers spoke against the changes\n(sometimes vulgarly), and many threatened to abandon the engine entirely.\n\nMega Crit was one such studio, calling Unity's actions \"a violation of trust.\"\nAt the time, it said it'd made much of Slay the Spire II in Unity, but would\nstill migrate to a different engine if Unity stuck to its guns.\n\n## Slaying spires with Godot\n\nDuring the controversy, the open-source Godot advertised itself as a free\nalternative to Unity. It even went so far as to start up a development fund to\nsustain itself ahead of a potential widespread shift from Unity.\n\nGodot also benefits from being cross-platform, and more recent updates let\ndevelopers test their project on its intended device.\n\nWhile Unity later established less controversial policy changes, the damage\nwas done. Mega Crit committing to Godot reflects the fractured\ndeveloper/engine-maker relationship, and puts Godot in a new position as a\nviable engine for other developers.\n\n## About the Author(s)\n\nJustin Carter\n\nContributing Editor, GameDeveloper.com\n\nA Kansas City, MO native, Justin Carter has written for numerous sites\nincluding IGN, Polygon, and SyFy Wire.
