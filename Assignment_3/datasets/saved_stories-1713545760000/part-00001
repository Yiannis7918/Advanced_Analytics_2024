Instead, you can initiate a rollback\nthrough the more menu or the package page for your item.\n\nA rollback requires a new version number under which the previous version of\nyour extension will be re-published and a reason for the rollback. After\nfilling in the required information, confirm the rollback.\n\nOnce the rollback is finished, the rolled-back package will be pushed to users\nthrough the normal Chrome auto-update process. You can verify that the\nrollback was successful on the package page or status page.\n\nRefer to the rollback documentation for more information, including how we\nhandle rollbacks in certain special cases. The version rollback feature is\nlive now, and the Chrome Web Store team is looking forward to continuing to\nimprove the rollout management process for developers.\n\nExcept as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the\nCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 License, and code samples are licensed under\nthe Apache 2.0 License.
