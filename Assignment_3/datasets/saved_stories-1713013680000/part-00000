Regardless, pressure\nhas been mounting for the U.K. to accelerate the timeline and give the laser\nto Ukraine following the release of a video showing it in action last month,\nwith Ukrainian MP Oleksiy Goncharenko telling Newsweek at the time his country\nwas \"ready to test\" DragonFire on the battlefield.\n\nBritish Defense Secretary Grant Shapps told reporters on Thursday that the\nU.K. was attempting to \"speed up\" development of DragonFire and potentially\ndeliver it to Kyiv before it has been fully tested, citing the impact that it\ncould have on the war by offering Ukraine a cost-effective method to destroy\nRussian drones, the Kyiv Post reported.\n\nThe DragonFire laser weapon is shown firing in Scotland. Ukrainian President\nVolodymyr Zelensky (inset) is seen. U.K. Defense Secretary Grant Shapps said\nthis week that DragonFire may be sent to Ukraine ahead of its expected... The\nDragonFire laser weapon is shown firing in Scotland. Ukrainian President\nVolodymyr Zelensky (inset) is seen. U.K. Defense Secretary Grant Shapps said\nthis week that DragonFire may be sent to Ukraine ahead of its expected 2027\nroll out. U.K. MINISTRY OF DEFENCE; Yan Dobronosov/Global Images Ukraine\n\n\"What I want to do is speed up what would usually be a very lengthy process,\npossibly up to 10 years, down to a much shorter timeframe and get it deployed,\npotentially on ships and potentially on land,\" Shapps said. \"What we've got\ngoing on here is very special, and a level that other countries are unlikely\nto be replicating...The product itself is genuinely years ahead.\"\n\nNewsletter\n\nThe Bulletin\n\nYour Morning Starts Here\n\nBegin your day with a curated outlook of top news around the world and why it\nmatters.\n\nBy clicking on SIGN ME UP, you agree to Newsweek's Terms of Use & Privacy\nPolicy.

New advanced laser weapon passes major test\n\nIf DragonFire is sent to Ukraine and proves to be an effective weapon on the\nbattlefield, it could dramatically slash the financial burden of Kyiv's aerial\ndefenses, as the British government estimates that it costs about \u00a310 (around\n$12) per firing.\n\nIn comparison, each U.S.-made Patriot interceptor missile, which Ukraine has\nheavily relied upon during its war with Russia, costs approximately $4 million\nto produce.\n\nProvided that DragonFire works as expected, the laser may also prove to be\nmore capable of hitting fast-moving targets than interceptor missiles, which\nhave the disadvantage of being unable to travel at the speed of light.\n\nHowever, delivering the weapon to Ukraine before it has been fully developed\nand expecting it to change the course of the war could be a tall order.\n\nThe U.S. military has been developing laser and other directed energy weapons\nfor decades, even successfully shooting down drones in test firings, but has\nyet to actually deploy any of the weapons in combat.\n\n## Uncommon Knowledge\n\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding\nconnections in the search for common ground.\n\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding\nconnections in the search for common ground.\n\nRequest Reprint & Licensing Submit Correction View Editorial Guidelines\n\n### About the writer\n\nAila Slisco\n\nAila Slisco is a Newsweek night reporter based in New York.
