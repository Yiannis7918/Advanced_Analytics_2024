That\u2019s the\nPoint.\n\nColumbia professor Johan de Jong has spent the last 15 years gathering the\nfoundational theorems of algebraic geometry in one place. His creation, the\nStacks Project, offers a new model for organizing and visualizing mathematical\ninformation.\n\nBy\n\nKim Martineau\n\nFebruary 02, 2022\n\nColumbia mathematics professor Johan de Jong.\n\nEarly in the pandemic, the Stacks Project crossed a new milestone: 7,000 pages\nof proofs, theorems, lemmas, and sections. But unlike previous millennial\nmarkers, this one passed without celebration.\n\n\u201cSad, but you know why,\u201d Johan de Jong wrote in his blog. \u201cThe main new\naddition that got us over the hump was the chapter on derived categories of\nvarieties. I hope you enjoy it.\u201d\n\nIn the Stacks Project Blog, Johan de Jong keeps readers up to date on changes\nto the site and current topics of discussion.\n\nAnd with that sunny update, the Columbia math professor was back at work, his\neyes fixed on the next hump. Now 7,300 pages, the Stacks Project looks like a\ntraditional textbook. But click into its 114 chapters, and equations and\ncommentary spill down the screen, unfurling six decades of scholarship in\nbite-sized chunks.\n\nThe Stacks Project has become so popular with geometers\u2014what mathematicians\nspecializing in algebraic geometry call themselves\u2014that it has inspired off-\nshoots in other fields. The site Kerodon is modeled after Stacks, and its\ncreators hope it will do for topology what the Stacks Project has done for\nalgebraic geometry.\n\n\u201cThe Stacks Project is a terrific new model for how to store and disseminate a\nlarge body of knowledge,\u201d said Kerodon creator Jacob Lurie, a mathematician at\nthe Institute for Advanced Study. \u201cIf you're looking for a reference or\nexplanation for something that seems like it ought to be a standard fact,\nchances are that you can find it there.\u201d\n\nThe American Mathematical Society recently awarded de Jong one of its highest\nhonors, the Steele Prize, for his contributions to the field.\n\n\u201cThe material isn\u2019t in a flat format as it has been for thousands of years,\u201d\nsaid Kiran Kedlaya, a mathematics professor at University of California, San\nDiego. \u201cEverything is broken into pieces, with links. This extra layer of\norganization allows you to search at random. It lowers the barriers, even for\npeople working on this topic.\u201d\n\n> \u201cWithout Johan there would be no Stacks Project.\u201d\n>\n> Max Lieblich, a mathematics professor at University of Washington and one of\n> de Jong's former students\n\nThe casual reader will find few names with the familiar ring of a Pythagoras\nor Gauss. But the math laid out here is as embedded in daily life as triangles\nand normal curves; cryptography is based on the elliptic curves described by\nalgebraic geometry; and street-mapping and face-recognition software use\nalgebraic geometry to reconstruct the three-dimensional world on a flat\nscreen.\n\nAt its most basic, algebraic geometry is the study of circles and other simple\nshapes described by polynomial equations like x2 + y2 = 1. In the 1960s,\nFrench mathematician Alexandre Grothendieck laid the foundation for modern\nalgebraic geometry with his text, Elements de Geometrie Algebriques. In it, he\nintroduced his theory of schemes, a combination of algebra and geometry for\ndescribing shapes as ordinary as a circle or as unusual as a manifold with\ninfinite dimensions defined by imaginary numbers. Algebraic stacks came along\nin the 1970s when mathematicians realized they needed an even more flexible\nway of classifying shapes in highly abstract situations. Stacks, for example,\nallowed them to calculate how many ways two triangles of the same shape might\nbe arranged on a flat plane.\n\nA flowchart of the logical implications of a proof in the Stacks Project.\n\nBut the theory of algebraic stacks was never spelled out as comprehensively as\nGrothendieck had done with schemes. This is the void that de Jong stepped in\nto fill in 2008. \u201cI thought it would be good to collect all these results in\none place so they\u2019d be easier to reference,\u201d he said.\n\nEleven years later, as de Jong typed in his last equation, he realized how\nmuch more was left to be done. Mistakes to fix. Definitions to align. Concepts\nto add and link. \u201cTo some extent, it\u2019s just what I do now,\u201d he said. \u201cI sort\nof don\u2019t know how to stop.\u201d\n\nThe enormity of the task is one factor fueling de Jong\u2019s obsession. At 7,300\npages, the project still covers just half of the existing scholarship on\nalgebraic stacks. The immediacy of online publishing is another motivating\nfactor. Thanks to hyperlinks and the cloud, the Stacks Project is a living\ndocument that requires updates and corrections in the way plants require water\nand sunlight.\n\n\u201cThe Stacks Project is not static because algebraic geometry is not static,\u201d\nsaid Kedlaya, a former student of de Jong\u2019s. \u201cThe subject continues to expand,\neven at a foundational level. There\u2019s constantly new material to incorporate,\nand this system is built to expand indefinitely.\u201d\n\nAnd the beauty of it is that no matter how big it grows, it\u2019s still easy to\nsearch, thanks to a tagging system proposed by Cathy O\u2019Neil, the best-selling\nauthor of Weapons of Math Destruction who happens to be married to de Jong.\nTags not only let the Stacks Project expand indefinitely, they let\nmathematicians map concepts and see how they relate.\n\nThe Stacks Project, the online algebraic geometry bible created and maintained\nby Columbia\u2019s Johan de Jong, allows mathematicians to visualize concepts and\nsee how they relate. Here, a famous result in commutative algebra is mapped\nout: the logical implications of the proof of the Cohen structure theorem for\ncomplete local rings. Top-level tag, 032A, represents the theorem; arrows show\nhow tagged concepts connect.\n\n\u201cYou start to see the structure of mathematics emerging from this document,\u201d\nsaid Max Lieblich, a mathematics professor at University of Washington.\n\nAn alternative visualization of how the Cohen structure theorem and related\nconcepts intersect.\n\nNot everyone is equipped to take on a Sisyphean task of this magnitude.\nColleagues describe de Jong as someone who is doggedly persistent and\ngenuinely passionate about teaching, known for taking on up to four times as\nmany graduate students as his peers and refusing to teach a course the same\nway twice; one year he taught a second-semester class on algebraic geometry as\nan Ask Me Anything series. That de Jong has tenure has also been integral to\nthe project\u2019s success, they say, freeing him from the academic grind of\npublishing.\n\nLieblich, another former student, is blunt: \u201cWithout Johan there would be no\nStacks Project.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s de Jong\u2019s exacting standards that also set the Stacks Project apart\nfrom other crowdsourced publications on the web. \u201cJohan gets very mad when I\ncall it Stackopedia,\u201d said Kedlaya. \u201cHe reads every line that goes in.\u201d\n\nThe one-editor model allows the Stacks Project to maintain one voice and a\nhigh level of quality control. But unlike the peer-reviewed literature that it\nattempts to corral into one place, the Stacks Project is designed to evolve.\nLong after de Jong is gone, this accumulation of knowledge will continue to\ngrow.\n\n\u201cI want this thing to be alive and keep changing,\u201d de Jong said.\n\nTags\n\nMathematics Research & Discovery\n\nShare to Facebook Share to X Share to LinkedIn Share to Print\n\n## News\n\nApril 12, 2024\n\n## The Associated Press in Nazi Germany\n\nApril 12, 2024\n\n## Newly Found Genetic Variant Defends Against Alzheimer\u2019s Disease\n\nApril 12, 2024\n\n## Columbians Witnessed, and Documented, Eclipse Totality\n\nApril 11, 2024\n\n## A Long-Standing Interest in Psychology Led Her to Dental School\n\nApril 10, 2024\n\n## Key Ocean Current Contains a Warning on Climate\n\n##\n\nMedia Contact\n\nKim Martineau Director of Science and Technology Communications\n\nklm32@columbia.edu\n\n## Contact Us\n\ncolumbianews@columbia.edu\n\n## Follow Us\n\nFacebook Twitter Instagram Youtube\n\n  * Office of Public Affairs\n  * Media Resources\n\nColumbia University\n\n\u00a92024 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using\nColumbia Sites\n\nThis website uses cookies as well as similar tools and technologies to\nunderstand visitors' experiences.
