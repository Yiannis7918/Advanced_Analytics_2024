It\u2019s not\ncomplicated: these kinds of gatekeeper decisions give historically unpopular\ntelecoms power they shouldn\u2019t have under the principle of an open, competitive\ninternet.\n\nWe\u2019ve noted how the Biden FCC will vote on April 25 to restore popular net\nneutrality rules stripped away during the Trump administration. Though we\u2019ve\nalso indicated there are some concerns among experts that the rules may wind\nup being weaker than the original 2015 edition.\n\nStanford law professor and net neutrality expert Barbara van Schewick has\nwritten a blog post noting that while the Rosenworcel FCC has shored up some\nconcerns on this front (the FCC\u2019s rules won\u2019t \u201cpre-empt\u201d tougher California\nrules, for example), there\u2019s still room for concern. Most notably surrounding\nthe new rules\u2019 treatment of so-called \u201cfast lanes\u201d:\n\n> \u201cThere\u2019s a huge problem: the proposed rules make it possible for mobile ISPs\n> to start picking applications and putting them in a fast lane \u2013 where\n> they\u2019ll perform better generally and much better if the network gets\n> congested.\u201d\n\nWireless carriers have made it clear that they plan to use \u201cnetwork slicing\u201d\nto create 5G fast lanes for certain apps such as video conferencing, games,\nand video. The FCC\u2019s new net neutrality rules allows such behavior, providing\nthe service or app isn\u2019t charged for them. So they can\u2019t, say, extort a\ncompany into paying more if it wants its service or app to see baseline\nperformance, which is good.\n\nBut the rules still allow ISPs to charge consumers all manner of fees if they\nwant the most popular apps and services to work their best. And van Schewick\nnotes, the rules still allow big ISPs to determine which companies and\nservices get priority. That inherently creates a system whereby less popular\nand successful apps and services (as well as academia-related services and\nnonprofits) are relegated to second-class network status, putting them at\ncompetitive and performance disadvantage:\n\n> \u201cAnd as we\u2019ve seen in the past, programs like this favor the most popular\n> apps, even when the program is supposedly open to all apps in a category and\n> no apps are paying the ISP. So the biggest apps will end up in all the fast\n> lanes, while most others would be left out. The ones left out would likely\n> include messaging apps like Signal, local news sites, decentralized\n> Fediverse apps like Mastodon and PeerTube, niche video sites like Dropout,\n> indie music sites like Bandcamp, and the millions of other sites and apps in\n> the long tail.\u201d\n\nvan Schewick provides some potential illustrative examples, several of which\nalready exist in various forms:\n\nSo again, the problem is that big and influential services or games like\nDisney or ESPN will see network priority during periods of 5G wireless network\ncongestion. While smaller competitors, nonprofits, and others get relegated\ninto a sea of \u201cbest effort\u201d network scenarios.\n\nvan Schewick notes the original Obama-era 2014 proposal restricted this stuff.\nAs did, in her legal opinion, the 2015 final rules. Even the half-assed\nproposals floated by Republicans at various points prohibited ISPs from\nspeeding up different apps and services arbitrarily. But she notes these new\n2024 rules include an obvious silence on this front that seems clearly lobbied\nfor by industry:\n\n> \u201cThe no-throttling rule that the FCC proposed in October explicitly\n> prohibited ISPs from slowing down apps and classes of apps; it was silent on\n> whether the rule also applies to speeding up. \u201c\n\nThe original Rosenworcel FCC proposal unveiled last October didn\u2019t include\nthose restrictions, so public interest groups, startups, and members of\nCongress all reached out asking why. April came, and the FCC\u2019s draft net\nneutrality order still didn\u2019t restrict the speeding up of specific apps and\nservices, outside to say it would address so-called \u201cfast lane\u201d issues on a\n\u201ccase by case basis.\u201d\n\nOpponents of net neutrality like to pretend that the rules are a \u201csolution in\nsearch of a problem,\u201d but industry has made it extremely clear that this kind\nof fractured internet, which consumers face ever-escalating nickel-and-diming,\nand the most popular apps and services get network priority over everybody\nelse, is precisely the sort of future they have in mind.\n\nLike any publicly-traded company, telecoms are obligated to shareholders to\nboost quarterly revenues at any cost. In telecom this routinely comes in the\nform of direct price hikes, cuts to service quality and broadband deployment,\nor substandard customer service. But it also increasingly comes in the forms\nof obnoxious monetization efforts that create entirely new obstacles you\u2019re\nthen charged extra to overcome; efforts you can\u2019t avoid because you either\nhave no competing broadband alternatives to flee too (market failure) or all\nof the competitors on offer are engaging in the same bad behavior (regulatory\ncapture).\n\nFCC bureaucrats have generally prioritized \u201cnot stifling innovation\u201d (as if\ntelecom giants have meaningfully innovated any time in the last quarter\ncentury) over protecting markets and consumers, and there\u2019s evidence that kind\nof thinking is once again at play. I\u2019d suspect, quite intentionally, none of\nthis will be addressed by the time the final net neutrality rules are voted on\nat the FCC\u2019s April 25th meeting.\n\nFiled Under: 5g, broadband, fast lanes, fcc, high speed internet, net\nneutrality, open internet, throttling, wireless\n\n19 CommentsLeave a Comment\n\nIf you liked this post, you may also be interested in...\n\n  * The GOP Is Blocking A Last Ditch Effort To Bring Cheap Broadband To Poor Americans\n  * Telecoms To Get $45 Billion In Taxpayer Broadband Subsidies, But Are Whining Because They Might Have To Deliver Affordable Broadband To A Few Poor People\n  * The FCC's New 'Broadband Nutrition Label' Doesn't Solve The Actual Problem: Unchecked Telecom Monopoly Power\n  * New Net Neutrality Rules Won't Harm Telecom Giants In The Slightest\n  * AT&T Stops Pretending It Had Nothing To Do With A Massive Data Breach Impacting 73 Million Customers.

Stone (profile) says:\n\nApril 18, 2024 at 6:14 am\n\n# Re:\n\n> he\u2019s just as bad as the other side\n\nJust yesterday, the \u201cother side\u201d celebrated the defeat of an attempt to repeal\na nearly two-centuries-old anti-abortion law in Arizona that has no exceptions\nfor rape or incest (which effectively allows a rapist to choose the mother of\nhis child). Like, we have the video evidence, so nobody can deny it\u2014especially\nduring election season.\n\nOne member of the \u201cother side\u201d has openly suggested, via his Twitter account,\nthat pro-Palestinian protestors should be physically assaulted. He even\ntweeted a video of protestors being violently dragged away from where they\nwere staging their protest as an example of what should be done. And even\nthough he didn\u2019t explicitly endorse the idea, he didn\u2019t condemn the idea of\nusing lethal violence (e.g., running over a protestor in a car) to stop\ndisruptive protests.\n\nThe \u201cother side\u201d has a long and well-recorded history of being racist, sexist,\nhomophobic, transphobic, and deferential to a single religious creed to the\nexclusion/mistreatment of all others.\n\nI don\u2019t like Joe Biden. He\u2019s a middling centrist needledick and I wish the\nDems would stop acting like him, in that they still act like \u201cbipartisanship\u201d\nand \u201ccompromise\u201d that gives \u201cthe other side\u201d more of what it wants will\nsomehow mollify \u201cthe other side\u201d enough to get them on board with more\nprogressive ideas. He\u2019s been a decent enough placeholder president to help the\ncountry get back on its feet after the pandemic, and that\u2019s it. But I\u2019m not\ngoing to sit here and argue that Democrats (including Biden) and \u201cthe other\nside\u201d are the exact same when \u201cthe other side\u201d is inching the country ever\ncloser to authoritarian rule by a bunch of religious freaks who want to\ncontrol everyone\u2019s bodies and minds.\n\nYes, politicians in general suck. Yes, Democrats in particular suck in their\nown way. No, \u201cboth sides\u201d are not equally as bad\u2014because I don\u2019t remember\nBiden celebrating the downfall of Roe v. Wade, calling for book bans of any\nkind of book with pro-LGBTQ content, and trying to shove religion into public\nschools. When he does anything even remotely as authoritarian as \u201cthe other\nside\u201d is doing (that doesn\u2019t involve military action in a foreign nation-\nstate), you let me know. Until then: Democrats don\u2019t have anything like\nProject 2025 in their back pocket, so maybe stop saying \u201cboth sides are\nequally bad\u201d when \u201cthe other side\u201d has a plan to effectively turn the\npresident into a king.\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nAnonymous Coward says:\n\nApril 18, 2024 at 6:19 am\n\n# Re: Re:\n\nJust flag the OP and move on.\n\nAnyone who says that Trump\u2019s opponent is as bad as he is might as well not be\nhuman at this point.

I've actually been going around telling people that Sun is currently nearing the peak of its 11-year cycle and has been unusually active recently.\n  * Didn't even occur to me that you'd be able to *see* that during the eclipse.\n  * Because the corona is where all of that really shows.\n  * Also spaceweather.gov\n  * Not enough government websites have a chart on their homepage that shows real-time updates on the current measured proton flux.\n  * mildconcern: fantastic, I'm glad you got to see it too.\n  * And yes they were three solar flares going, one of which was big enough to be seen by the naked eye\n  * only two small sun spots though\n  * John Roddy: No, that's one *gigantic* sun spot.\n  * Mike Masnick: the weirdest thing, though, was we had no traffic at all. we found a small town in texas that was a bit off the beaten path, but looked like the weather would cooperate, and we drove 75 miles from our hotel to it, saw no traffic. was able to park easily, even grabbed a nice picnic table in a gazebo. soon after we got there, the park started to fill up, but it never got *crowded*. and then afterwards, we drove back and hit no traffic on the way back either. the only \"line\" we ran into was when stopped at a pie shop on our way back to get some pie to celebrate\n  * mildconcern: I think a lot of the real fanatics ditched going to Texas all together\n  * a fair few folks in the park I was at had plans to be there and then switched up at the last minute with the forecasts to come to New England instead\n  * The town I was in moved their location from the smaller park downtown to this bigger one just two days before the event because of the same factors\n  * Mike Masnick: like absolutely nothing has been crowded (other than the pie stand). pickup line for rental car was non existent. no traffic to the hotel. hotel did not seem crowded at all. everything has been smooth sailing.\n  * mildconcern: The second biggest cheer of the day (after totality) happened when a truck arrived with six more porta potties to help alleviate the hour long line\n  * But it was fun having a crowd. I brought my telescope which made me popular, and it was great letting other people look through it\n  * John Roddy: It was so overcast for me that I legit couldn't even see clouds.\n  * mildconcern: I wasn't really aiming to take pictures primarily but I did get a few\n  * John Roddy: Just a perfectly homogenous gray.\n  * mildconcern: https://www.instagram.com/p/C5jo...\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/C5jo_1bvI0S/?igsh=cW85dnc5czF4Zzg4\n\n  * Mike Masnick: Heh. Yeah, the park we were in had fixed bathrooms (and even cleaned them right after the eclipse so we had clean bathrooms to use before heading out) and a big row of porta potties, but neither ever got crowded. there was a *good* sized crowd but never got crowded\n  * The one thing we didn't really have where we were was a good view of the 360 degree sunset. I remember that from the last one we saw. but didn't really see it this time due to trees around the park.\n  * You should have driven over to where we were! No traffic, very few clouds.\n  * mildconcern: yeah I did not have as good a view of the 360 as I did in Casper Wyoming. It was pretty good and you got a sense of it because we were on a lakeshore but the other angles were mountains\n  * John Roddy: Unfortunately, I had a dentist appointment at just barely after the right time. :/\n  * Which is the only reason I'm able to eat anything again.\n  * Mike Masnick: we really lucked out in 2017, because we found this random hill in the middle of absolute nowhere, eastern oregon, that gave us a 360 degrees view of NOTHING but fields from the top. It was a perfect spot to watch\n  * John Roddy: They had to try like 20 different times to get the right set of x-rays.\n  * Mike Masnick: Yikes.\n  * John Roddy: So I'm expecting to grow a second tongue within the next few days or something.\n  * Interestingly, x-ray tech has finally been miniaturized enough that the camera is entirely handheld now.\n  * The tube just has a really thick glass shield lining the end of it, presumably lined with lead.\n  * deadspatula: Fascinatingly, the big advancement has been in better dosing, not simply the size of components. The big machines needed a big burst and leaked a lot of x-rays. That's why the dentist had to hide behind the lead wall and we covered the reproductive organs - the dose wasn't bad once every six months, but multiple times a day would be serious. And the units therefore needed to be mounted. The handheld units better direct a much lower dose, and manufacturers claim technicians do not get dangerous doses of stray x-rays. That said, the notable property of x-rays is penetration. Many of the units I've seen have a guard as you describe, but nothing opaque, and if its not opaque its not lined with enough lead to matter.\n  * John Roddy: Lead lined glass is almost certainly more than enough to at least scatter any stray x-rays that find their way back.\n  * But yeah, x-ray tech in general got a pretty significant overhaul in the past decade or so.\n  * When Chandra launched in '99, it was the heaviest payload the shuttle ever carried.\n  * Fast forward to '21, and we've got IXPE.\n  * Chandra is close to 6,000kg.\n  * IXPE is just over 300.\n  * mildconcern: I wonder how much the general advancement of detectors driven by the cell phone camera revolution has spilled over. That certainly has helped the field of astronomical detection quite a bit.\n  * Digital sensors that had laughable resolution used to cost a fortune in the 1990s when they started to come out. And now you can get miracle devices for far less.\n  * John Roddy: Cell phone stuff is all in the microwave range.\n  * That's most useful for detecting the cosmic microwave background, which is probably the closest thing to a natural encyclopedia we're ever going to get.\n  * mildconcern: phone cameras also do sense visual light\n  * John Roddy: I feel like everyone I tell this to is hearing it for the first time, but...\n  * I *thought* it was common knowledge that your phone camera is pretty good at seeing infrared too.\n  * It's a really quick and easy way to check if a remote control is working.\n  * Infrared LEDs *will* be visible through the sensor.\n  * mildconcern: Oh yeah I knew that, I was just being a wiseass\n  * it's not hugely far in the infrared spectrum\n  * can't use it as a heat detector or something. Just a smidge.\n  * but I'm mostly saying in terms of astronomy applications. The overall success in designing sensors and detectors in smaller scales has hugely helped anyway\n  * no matter the wavelengths\n  * John Roddy: Yeah, the interesting stuff requires some pretty intense tech.\n  * Almost everything glows in the infrared spectrum, after all.\n  * mildconcern: It's a big part of why they stuck the JWT in space\n  * since it's mostly working in that range\n  * John Roddy: That's only half the story\n  * Spritzer needed some pretty extreme shielding too.\n  * Except the tech wasn't *quite* ready to make the active cooling reliable enough.\n  * A lot of people think of \"cold\" in terms of what chilly weather feels like on earth.\n  * The cold air sucks the heat right out of you.\n  * But space doesn't have that air.\n  * So despite space being extremely cold, it's actually really hard to cool things down out there.\n  * The reason the space shuttle always had the bay doors open in orbit is because that's where the radiators were.\n  * mildconcern: yeah. but the IR wavelengfths that JWT are detecting can't even get through at all even in Earth orbit\n  * so that's why it's out at the Lagrange Point\n  * Despite the \"can't fuck this one up and fix it later\" nature of that as opposed to Hubble\n  * John Roddy: It's not even *at* the Lagrange point\n  * It's in an orbit around it\n  * Samuel Abram: I took a screencap of a thread on facebook, to illustrate the necessity of checkmarks as verification and not a marker of a paid status.\n  * Unfortunately, I can't upload it here\n  * [link]\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/17P1ICo5rwQcW4dnkY8KSX8XzdIXoSQZN/view?usp=drive_link\n\n  * John Roddy: Wow. I legit didn't even realize Lowery was still alive.\n  * He was a grumpy old man last time I encountered him years and years ago, after all.\n  * Mike Masnick: Yes, but he's just asking people to be more \"genuinely empathetic\" like the time he suggested I should get cancer and die in a fire.\n  * John Roddy: I don't know. His decision to back up the guy who compared Brian to Hitler kinda seems to undermine that a bit.\n  * mildconcern: \"Following that were screenshots of tweets (or whatever the fuck)\". You apparently are feeling the same degree of \"done with that shit\" as I am, @Tim Cushing\n  * BentFranklin: Crickets from Chirp Systems in Smart Lock Key Leak [link]\n\nhttps://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/04/crickets-from-chirp-systems-in-smart-lock-\nkey-leak/\n\n  * Mike Masnick: yikes. that's bad\n  * BentFranklin: \"We justifiably loathe Elon Musk for destroying Twitter, but we should have a hundred times the bile for Larry Page, Sergey Brin and Sundar Pichai. All three have unquestionably damaged our ability to access knowledge through their actively harmful approach to maintaining a portal that billions use to find answers to everything.\" [article]\n\nhttps://www.wheresyoured.at/the-great-looting-of-the-internet/\n\n  * Mike Masnick: Not sure I buy that argument entirely. Especially as I see the enshittification of Google as (finally) a window of opportunity for others to step in\n  * John Roddy: Cloud powered AI cryptocurrency\n  * mildconcern: Yeah Google is so much easier to switch away from than a social network.\n  * I've been using Kagi for months now and haven't looked back. I tried DuckDuckGo and found that I often had to try Google when it failed. I haven't had to do the same with Kagi.\n  * Mike Masnick: kagi has been good for me too...\n  * Samuel Abram: It's just that Kagi costs money and google doesn't\n  * BentFranklin: That sounds great actually, considering what free gets you these days. Maybe someone can get Kagi added to this: [link]\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/wiki/index\n\n  * mildconcern: I found after trying it for a trial that it saved me more than enough in time to make up for the ten bucks a month.\n  * Worst comes to worse I'll just stop supporting those Techdirt cranks. *grins*\n  * Samuel Abram: That\u2019s fair\n  * Though if I were you, I\u2019d _never_ stop supporting these Techdirt cranks.
