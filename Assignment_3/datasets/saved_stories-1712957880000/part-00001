There\nis more than one way to succeed and a lot of it will depend on context and\ntiming.\n\nThat said, there are a few ground truths that vastly increase your chances of\nbuilding a successful company. Most of this is covered in the first week\ncurriculum at YC.\n\nTalk to your customers. Focus on Product Market Fit. Make something that\npeople want.\n\nDuring our batch, Michael Seibel told us that regardless of what he or the\nother partners would say, every batch, founders would still ignore the advice.\n\nI remember this clearly because I listened and thought we were doing these\nthings. We launched an open source note taking tool (Dendron). We had\nthousands of active users and we \"talked\" with them daily over Discord and\nGithub. It wasn't until we tried (and failed) to introduce paid team plans two\nyears later that we realized we didn't understand our users.\n\nIt was only then that we started scheduling 30m user interviews every day over\nthe course of several months. Through this process, we learned our users had\nno desire to use Dendron with their teams. It was a power tool for power\nusers. Our GTM completely ignored what our customers actually wanted.\n\n### On Product Market Fit\n\nYour only real job as an early stage founder is finding product market fit\n(PMF). PMF is not just your only job but it is the job that only you can do.\nQualitatively, it is the feeling of chasing a boulder vs pushing a boulder up\na hill. Quantitatively, (for B2B at least) it is when you have built a\nrepeatable sales channel that you can scale by throwing more money at it.\n\nYour investors can help introduce you to relevant people, successful founders\ncan tell you how they found PMF, but ultimately, you are the only person that\ncan determine PMF for your company.\n\nA big part of PMF is timing and luck - factors that are for most parts, out of\nyour control. This is why even other founders that have found PMF are of\nlimited help.\n\nWhat you can control is the market you're in, your team, and the unique\ninsight that you bring as the founder. Your job as a founder is to leverage\nthese strengths to get to PMF. Anything that is not in service of this does\nnot matter in an early stage startup.\n\nAt Dendron, we had limited product fit but no market fit. To make the venture\nmodel work, we needed to sell to teams but our product was focused on\nindividuals.\n\n### On Binary Outcomes\n\nMany things in startup land feel binary. Raising money. Closing a sale.\n\"Succeeding\" as a company. Adopting this view adds tons of pressure and lead\nto despondency and burnout when things don't work out.\n\nInstead, think of the process itself as the outcome and find ways of getting\n\"wins\" that is independent of the outcome.\n\nWhen raising money for Dendron, I began each meeting by asking investors to\nexplain what made them interested in us. This not only helped me frame my\npitch but also helped me iterate on our value proposition for future meetings,\na \"win\" that I could take with me regardless of the current investment\ndecision.\n\n### On Burnout\n\nStartups are a grind. Burnout is real. Most founders, even the successful\nones, will struggle with burnout at some point(s). More on the topic here.\n\nAs hard as it might be to do, take a break. Have one day of the week reserved\nfor non-startup related things. Exercise. Sleep. You'll fall behind far more\nfrom burn out then the time you invest in mitigating it.\n\nDuring my second pivot, I ended up taking a month sabbatical due to burnout.\n\n### On the YC Community\n\nAs YC alumni, you are now part of the most connected and well respected\nstartup community in the world. From your fellow batch mates to the group\npartners, almost everyone you meet is exceptional in some way.\n\nLean into this, even/especially after the batch.\n\nA shortlist of things that I have relied on during and after the batch: -\noffice hours - founder whats app groups - local meetups - early customers -\ncustomer research - YC deals - hiring - future co-founders - drinking buddies\n- bookface forums\n\nThe last thing I'll add before signing of - enjoy the journey. Building a\nstartup is hard. The road is long. Celebrate milestones with the people that\ngot you there. Make something that people want!\n\n### Related\n\n  * none Weekly Review - 2023-12-29\n  * startup Context Dependent Painkiller - 2024-03-29\n  * none Weekly Review - 2023-12-27\n  * advice Yc Ap - 2024-04-05\n  * journal Weekly Review - 2023-06-19\n\nCreated 2024-04-11T18:14:45.135000, updated 2024-04-11T18:15:19.481000 \u00b7\nHistory \u00b7 Edit\n\n", "frontpage": false}
