If Spotify had its way,\nall podcasts would be created within the Spotify ecosystem, either through its\nSpotify for Podcasters tool (formerly the app Anchor), within its in-house\nstudios or the many podcast production companies it has acquired over the\nyears (Gimlet, Parcast, The Ringer), or by one of its exclusive partner shows,\nlike Call Her Daddy or The Joe Rogan Experience.\n\nI watched Spotify\u2019s quick acquisition of the podcast production companies and\ntech with increasing unease, because I\u2019d seen this film before, and it didn\u2019t\nend well. Podcast production companies have bent themselves toward Spotify\u2019s\npriorities by taking Spotify-exclusive contracts, in which the companies would\nmake shows for exclusive distribution on the Spotify platform. This has\nresulted in a ton of original, exclusive content on the platform (and of\ncourse, Spotify also owned the intellectual property). As of last year,\nSpotify was the top U.S. podcast network by reach, according to Edison\nResearch. Of course, this is because of the success of hugely popular shows\nlike Call Her Daddy and Joe Rogan, but it\u2019s also because of the sheer number\nof different shows available on the platform that aren\u2019t available anywhere\nelse.\n\nPrivate tech companies have been interfering in media for several decades now\nand we have seen this play out with devastating effects in the world of\njournalism. All of this has made me incredibly wary of Spotify\u2019s entry into\nthe podcasting space, because I saw it replicating what Facebook and Twitter\nhad done in digital media just a few years prior.\n\nBefore I was an audio producer, I was a social media editor. I worked at The\nWashington Post from 2015\u20132017, and in that time I saw our team double in size\nas the paper invested more in social media distribution, as homepage traffic\nbegan to transform and more readers were coming in through places like\nFacebook and Twitter.\n\nWhat this looked like at the Post was a veritable army of new hires, in social\nmedia plus video producers whose sole purpose was to feed video to platforms\noutside of the Post\u2019s website. It did not stop there. The company hired on-air\nhosts, created a shiny studio inside the newsroom to cover election season,\nand embedded producers in every section to generate videos.\n\nThe Post invested countless dollars in video and wasn\u2019t the only publication\nto do so. Companies like The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, CNN,\nBuzzFeed, NPR, and Hearst all invested heavily in video and social, hiring\nproducers and churning out hundreds of videos a day. You might remember the\nfamous line \u201cpivot to video\u201d\u2014that became a shorthand for poor foresight and a\nlack of strategy and an excuse to prioritize one part of the newsroom over\nanother.\n\nThese pivots weren\u2019t just happening because everyone got an itch for video at\nthe exact same moment. It was because platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and\neven YouTube were offering money to publications to subsidize their hires and\npump out more social video. It was a kind of transactional pay-for-play\nagreement that would have been unthinkable in the past, made more palatable by\nthe dire straits of funding journalism.\n\nIn 2016, Facebook signed contracts with more than 140 media companies and\npublic figures to incentivize video creation, according to reporting by the\nWall Street Journal. I remember my editors at the Post encouraging us to\nbrainstorm as many Facebook Live ideas as possible for each upcoming news\nevent. The goal was to come up with silly ideas, fun ideas, and most\nimportantly, ideas that would keep people watching.\n\nIn exchange, the publications saw their video content generate greater reach\non-platform\u2014numbers only years later we would come to realize were totally\nmalleable and within the platforms\u2019 control. In the years since, hundreds of\nmillions of dollars have changed hands between Meta and publishers; according\nto Semafor, the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and Washington Post\nreceived $53.5 million a year combined from 2018-2022.\n\nIn the months following Trump\u2019s inauguration, we learned more about just how\nbig a role social media had played in spreading misinformation that\ncontributed, in part, to his win. Cambridge Analytica\u2019s antics were exposed.\nIn 2018, Congress called Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg before it to\nexplain how Facebook works. In one particularly indelible exchange, Republican\nSen. Dan Sullivan asked Zuckerberg whether Facebook was a tech company or a\npublisher; Zuckerberg gestured broadly toward the former, with a non-answer\nthat could provide plausible deniability for any future changes in direction.\n\nIn January 2018, Facebook announced it would deprioritize content from media\norganizations and instead prioritize \u201cmeaningful social interactions,\u201d a\ndecision that resulted in plummeting social referral metrics across the\nindustry. According to The Pew Research Center, \u201cUnique visitors to the\nwebsites of both newspapers and digital-native news sites showed no growth\nbetween the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2018, the second year in which there\nwas no notable growth.\u201d This stands in stark contrast to the period of\n2014\u20132016, when traffic was steadily rising.\n\nIn the years since, Meta has continued to move away from news content and the\njournalism industry has seen a calamitous number of shutdowns, layoffs, and\nbuyouts. Since reaching its peak in April 2020, the Washington Post, along\nwith nearly every other news publisher, has seen traffic drop to a fraction of\nwhat it once was.\n\nThe news industry still hasn\u2019t recovered from these tech companies\u2019\ninterference with the creation and distribution of the news. The post-\nrecession socioeconomic moment was one of hyper-capitalist credulity in legacy\nmedia: this or that generous billionaire, the story went, would be willing to\nspend the money necessary to save the industry, and tech companies were as\ninterested in informing the public as they were in scaling up and making\nmoney. But when Facebook shifted priorities, the companies that had invested\nin social video were like Wile E. Coyote, discovering only too late that he\u2019d\nalready run off a cliff.\n\nBy the end of the heady days of social media partnerships in journalism I had\ntransitioned my career into audio. I thought that focusing on making work for\na famously intimate medium would collapse the distance between creator and\naudience in the way social media claimed to do. I knew about the intimacy of\naudio; I felt like my favorite audio hosts were my friends with whom I hung\nout at the same time every week.\n\nOf course, now I know that this parasocial relationship is manufactured by\nhosts and producers to create a sense of familiarity and habit that gets\npeople to come back. Part of that is the forced intimacy that occurs when\nlisteners develop auditory relationships with hosts. But it was also the\ndirectness of the technology: As social media apps switched off chronological\nnewsfeeds in favor of algorithmic models, podcasts became one of the few ways\ncreators could talk to their audiences directly, unmediated by algorithms.\nSpotify, and its desire for a walled garden of audio it controls, obviously\nhas changed that. My anxiety about Spotify\u2019s increasing dominance isn\u2019t just\nbased on its market position, but how the company sits when compared with\nancient internet history. I\u2019m talking about RSS.\n\nRSS stands for Really Simple Syndication, and it\u2019s the technology that made\npodcasts possible. RSS started out as a way to aggregate blog posts from\nvarious sites so readers could get a regular digest of their favorite writing\nwithout having to navigate to 20 different places each morning.\n\nIn a previous era of online news, sites would provide a special URL that\nrepresented its RSS feed, which users would paste into their feed readers,\nlike Google Reader, which would allow them to get all the updates they wanted\neach day in one place. It\u2019s kind of like what a Twitter feed would be if it\nwas actually useful, completely chronological, and not cluttered up with\nanyone else\u2019s bad opinions.\n\nI called up Leo Laporte, who is an original internet guy and founder of This\nWeek in Tech to tell me more about the origins of RSS and podcasting\ntechnology, because he was actually there. He\u2019s been hosting his show since\n2005.\n\nTWiT was originally a radio show that published to a website, and if listeners\nwanted to listen on their MP3 players, they would have to manually download\nnew episodes from the TWiT website. But in the fall of 2004, Dave Winer, one\nof the people involved in the development of RSS, added a new feature. \u201cHe had\nthis idea that you could also put an audio file in that feed,\u201d Laporte said.\n\u201cThat really is how podcasting was born.\u201d Now, listeners could effectively\nsubscribe to different radio shows that were publishing online, and they could\nhave new episodes delivered directly to their computers\u2014and eventually their\nsmartphones\u2014without having to navigate to different websites.\n\nThis is still largely how podcast publishing works. Almost every podcast you\nlisten to is RSS-based, which is why you can choose from a universe of podcast\ndirectory apps to listen to any podcast you want. You can also paste a\npodcast\u2019s RSS feed link into your podcast app and it should be able to pull up\nthe podcast you\u2019re looking for (paying Normal Gossip subscribers will\nrecognize these steps for how to get the secret, unlisted subscriber feed).\nThat\u2019s why, when hosts urge you to subscribe to their shows, the often say\n\u201cwherever you get your podcasts\u201d\u2014because podcasting is built on a technology\nthat, according to Anil Dash, is \u201csupposed to be impossible: open, empowering\ntech that's not owned by any one company, that can't be controlled by any one\ncompany, and that allows people to have ownership over their work and their\nrelationship with their audience.\u201d\n\nBut Spotify\u2014along with many other companies\u2014wants to create a closed ecosystem\nfor the creation, distribution, and consumption of podcasts, bypassing RSS\ntechnology altogether because that would allow them to harvest more listener\ndata to leverage with advertisers.\n\nLaporte talked about how Spotify\u2019s interest in mining data from users has\naffected podcast ad sales in a December TWIT episode: \u201cI was doing those host\nendorsement reads that people had done for years on radio [...] Honestly the\nsad thing to me is I think it really worked for our advertisers,\u201d he said. But\nnow, many of those ads have dried up: \u201cAdvertisers, whether it's good for them\nor not, whether they can prove its value or not, are reluctant to buy ads that\ndon't have lots of demographic information about the person hearing it, about\nwhen they heard it, where they heard it, how long they listen, all that stuff.\nAnd RSS can't do that. Traditional podcasts, we know nothing\u2014I know your IP\naddress, that's it. But Spotify, if you listen in the app, they know\neverything. They got your credit card, dude.\u201d\n\nOver the last decade, I\u2019ve heard countless audio executives talk about \u201cthe\npower of the play button,\u201d which is one of the single most powerful things a\npublisher can own in an audio economy. Several companies, like Amazon, the New\nYork Times, and even NPR, have tried to silo their users away from open RSS\ntech and onto their own private apps, but none has matched Spotify\u2019s success;\nmore than half of the approximately one million monthly downloads we see for\nNormal Gossip come from Spotify.\n\nSpotify showed its hand with regards to RSS at its 2022 Investor Day\npresentation, when a representative for the company called RSS an \u201coutdated\ntechnology\u201d and implied that the future of podcasting was on tech and social\nplatforms that didn\u2019t rely on it. (Ironically, their investor resource page\ndoes offer RSS alerts for investors. I guess it\u2019s not too outdated for Spotify\nto use for corporate comms.)\n\nWhen one company owns such a significant portion of the production,\ndistribution, and consumption of a medium, any moves it makes cast massive\nripple effects across the industry. I wrote about this last summer when\nSpotify essentially shuttered Gimlet Media, the narrative podcast production\ncompany founded by Alex Blumberg and Matt Lieber. When Spotify seemed to pivot\nits podcast focus to celebrity-hosted chat shows that publish on a weekly\ncadence, many people in the podcast industry\u2014particularly the documentary\npodcast industry\u2014worried that this was the end of this moment in podcasting.\n\nAnd in a way, it was. Once again, a single corporation largely overtook a\nniche within the media, which then rose and fell according to that\ncorporation\u2019s priorities. Facebook shifted priorities post-2016 and\njournalists lost jobs; Spotify shifted priorities in 2023 and producers lost\njobs. Spotify is already showing signs of changing once again; it has begun\nloosening its exclusivity for shows on the platform. All this only shows the\nfragility and contingency inherent to building a media business on one or two\nfickle\u2014and publicly traded\u2014companies.\n\nThe difference is that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too late to take back our feeds. You\ndon\u2019t have to understand the technology of RSS to choose to listen to your\npodcasts on an open app. You can just choose to do it.\n\nMike Rugnetta, host of the independent podcast Never Post, sums up the\nresignation many audio producers feel in relation to Spotify: They submit\ntheir podcast feed to Spotify, but their website includes a disclaimer that\nsays \u201cSpotify if you must.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpotify's whole business model is capturing attention,\u201d he said, \u201cIt is my\nopinion that there is an amount of money that you can have that is immoral,\nand I think that the people who run Spotify have reached that amount. [...]\nYou have someone who has an immoral amount of money, and then they do bad\nthings with that money. And they are able to do that because of the attention\nthat they are able to capture with their app, which we contribute directly to\nby putting Never Post on it.\u201d\n\nThe payoff, of course, comes in the number of users already on the platform,\nand the frictionless promotion of podcasts and other audio content in the same\napp where people have been listening to music for years. That is the bargain\nnews consumers and creators face in this current iteration of the internet: to\ntrade ease of access for our data, for choice, and for integrity.\n\nYou can opt for ways of engaging with your favorite journalists and creators\nthat are minimally mediated by tech companies. Yes, follow them on Instagram\nor TikTok or whatever, but if you don\u2019t want their work buried under the\nalgorithm, subscribe to their newsletter or podcast. Email newsletters and\npodcasts via RSS are some of the only ways that creators can reach audiences\nwithout jumping through algorithmic hoops, like posting Reels and TikToks with\ntrending sounds or whatever else the platforms have decided will play nice\nwith the current thinking.\n\nAdriene Lily is a sound artist and audio engineer who, with her partner Stuart\nLynn, runs Long Live the New Sound, a non-commercial \u201canti-podcast podcast\u201d\nthat collects and shares submitted sound art. There are no hosts, no ads, and\nno regular drop days. LLtNS takes the idea of creative friction even further:\nIt exists on a private feed that Lynn built, rather than a feed generated\nthrough third-party hosting platforms like Podbean or Libsyn: \u201cBasically when\nsomebody uploads a piece of audio, it goes to an admin area that Stuart and I\ncan see, and we listen, and then we can approve it or reject it. And if we\napprove it, it goes directly onto the feed and it just becomes a new episode.\u201d\nLily doesn\u2019t have any aspirations to grow LLtNS\u2019s audience: \u201cI couldn\u2019t handle\nit if more than the 17 people that currently like it listened to it,\u201d she\nsaid, a statement that would seem inconceivable to the project managers and\ncontent leads dangling promotion opportunities to producers in exchange for\nsubmitting their work to Spotify.\n\nLike buying your books from a local indie bookseller or supporting local\nfarmers or even reading deeper than the first three sponsored Google search\nresults, living and consuming (food, clothing, art, information) in a way that\npreserves some amount of choice and integrity sometimes requires being OK with\nfriction. And that friction extends to the creators and media companies, too.\nIt\u2019s easy to record, upload, and publish podcast episodes from directly inside\nthe Spotify for Podcasters system. They\u2019ll even help you sell ads and make\nmoney! But what you give up is wide distribution of your work. It also means\nfewer technical hurdles when you publish and more data for prospective\nadvertisers. It means less ownership over the thing you create and the\nrelationships that flow from that.\n\nFor podcast listeners who don\u2019t want to see a monopoly overtake the audio\nindustry, embracing friction looks like downloading an independent podcast\napp, like Pocket Casts or Overcast and re-subscribing to the podcasts you want\nto support. You\u2019ll jump apps when you switch modes from music to podcast, and\nthat\u2019s about it. It might also mean paying for your content, especially when a\nshow you love offers a way to support them financially through subscriptions\nor donations. It\u2019s a bit slower, but not much. It\u2019s still the internet, after\nall.\n\n(Disclosure: A podcast I produced in 2018 was eventually sold to Spotify and\npublished as a Spotify original, and in 2022 I taught an undergraduate J-term\nclass at NYU sponsored by Spotify.)\n\n### Recommended\n\nGimlet Media\u2019s Story Was Always Going To End Like This\n\nIf you liked this blog, please share it!
