British Columbia has banned self-driving\nvehicles that exceed an SAE autonomy rating of Level 2, which makes the\noperation of any vehicle with Levels 3, 4, and 5 illegal in the interest of\npublic safety. The ban is part of an update to B.C.'s Motor Vehicle Act that\nwent into effect on April 5, 2024, after being proposed by legislators in\n2023.\n\nThe provincial government says this latest update of the \"Motor Vehicle Act\nprohibits a person from driving, or permitting the driving of, a Level 3, 4 or\n5 automated vehicle. This means that highly automated self-driving vehicles\ncannot yet be driven on public roads in B.C., nor can highly automated self-\ndriving features be used...\" The ban is in effect for now, but that could\nchange as the tech evolves. The rules also outline possible consequences for\ndrivers, which will range up to a max penalty of $2,000 (CAD) in fines, or\njust shy of $1,500 at current exchange rates. Violators (a person in charge of\na \"self-driving\" car) could also face up to six months of prison time.\n\nThese are the highest forms of punishment, however, and penalties for drivers\nbegin with milder fines of $368 (CAD), or $266, along with three penalty\npoints on their licenses. Points can eventually lead to license suspensions,\nand of course, they have an adverse effect on auto insurance rates. The more\npoints on your license, the higher the price of insurance becomes.\n\nCars with autonomous features up to Level 2 remain unaffected by the ban, so\nTesla owners who use Autopilot and FSD won't have to worry about their\ninsurance premiums going sky high\u2014or, at least, not going any higher than they\nalready are. Ford and GM vehicle owners with BlueCruise and Super Cruise are\nalso exempt from the ban.\n\nIt's worth noting that banning \"highly automated\" vehicles, as the British\nColumbian government refers to them, might seem like a dramatic move, but it\nisn't such a sweeping prohibition as it first seems. There are no Level 3\nautonomous vehicles for sale in Canada at the moment, and Levels 3, 4 and 5\ncontinue to elude most automakers. Few cars have achieved these ratings, which\ndo not require human monitoring. These include the Mercedes-Benz EQS and\nS-Class with Drive Pilot, as well as the Honda Legend with Honda Sensing\nElite. But these cars paired with their specific AV tech are available only\noutside of Canada and are subject to conditional use in their respective\nmarkets.\n\nAll of which is to say that Level 3 AVs are exceedingly rare around the world,\nand remain virtually nonexistent in British Columbia. But the decision to ban\n\"self-driving\" cars could be a preemptive one, and it may prove beneficial for\nB.C. residents who mistrust AVs on public roads. A 2023 study conducted by the\nUniversity of British Columbia's REACT Lab found that the majority of\nrespondents are wary of AVs and agree that regulation is necessary to\ngradually unleash self-driving cars into the wild. This gradual approach seems\nto be in contrast to that of the U.S., where autonomous vehicles from Waymo\nand Cruise have wreaked havoc on public roads from the Pacific Northwest to\nsouthern California.\n\nTayfun Coskun/Getty\n\nGot a tip?
