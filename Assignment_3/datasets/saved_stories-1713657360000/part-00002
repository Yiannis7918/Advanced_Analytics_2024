It is\na walled enclave within the city of Augsburg, Bavaria. It takes its name from\nthe Fugger family and was founded in 1516 by Jakob Fugger the Younger (known\nas \"Jakob Fugger the Rich\") as a place where the needy citizens of Augsburg\ncould be housed. By 1523, 52 houses had been built, and in the coming years\nthe area expanded with various streets, small squares and a church. The gates\nwere locked at night, so the Fuggerei was, in its own right, very similar to a\nsmall independent medieval town. It is still inhabited today, affording it the\nstatus of being the oldest public housing project in the world.\n\n## Description[edit]\n\nThe rent was and still is one Rhenish gulden per year (equivalent to 0.88\neuros), as well as to make three daily prayers for the current owners of the\nFuggerei \u2013 the Lord's Prayer, Hail Mary, and the Nicene Creed \u2013 and to work a\npart-time job in the community.^[1] The conditions to live there remain the\nsame as they were 500 years ago: one must have lived at least two years in\nAugsburg, be of the Catholic faith and have become indigent without debt. The\nfive gates are still locked every day at 10 PM.\n\nHousing units in the area consist of 45 to 65 square metre (500\u2013700 square\nfoot) apartments, but because each unit has its own street entrance it\nsimulates living in a house. There is no shared accommodation; each family has\nits own apartment, which includes a kitchen, a parlour, a bedroom and a tiny\nspare room, altogether totalling about 60 square metres. Ground-floor\napartments all have a small garden and garden shed, while upper-floor\napartments have an attic. All apartments have modern conveniences such as\ntelevision and running water. One ground-floor apartment is uninhabited,\nserving as a museum open to the public. The doorbells have elaborate shapes,\neach being unique, dating back to before the installation of streetlights when\nresidents could identify their door by feeling the handle in the dark.^[2]\n\n## History[edit]\n\nThe Fugger family initially established their wealth in weaving and\nmerchandising. Jakob the Rich expanded their interests into silver mining and\ntrading with Venice. Additionally he was a financier and counted the Vatican\nas a notable client. The family became financial backers of the Habsburg\nfamily, and he financed the successful election of Charles V as Emperor of the\nHoly Roman Empire in 1519.^[2]\n\nThe Fuggerei was first built between 1514 and 1523 under the supervision of\nthe architect Thomas Krebs, and in 1582, Hans Holl added St. Mark's Church to\nthe settlement. Expanded further in 1880 and 1938, the Fuggerei today\ncomprises 67 houses with 147 apartments, a well and an administrative\nbuilding.\n\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart's great-grandfather, the mason Franz Mozart, lived in\nthe Fuggerei between 1681 and 1694 and is commemorated today by a stone\nplaque.\n\nThe Fuggerei was heavily damaged by the bombings of Augsburg during World War\nII but has been rebuilt in its original style.\n\n## Upkeep[edit]\n\nThe Fuggerei is supported by a charitable trust established in 1520 which\nJakob Fugger funded with an initial deposit of 10,000 guilders.^[2] According\nto The Wall Street Journal, the trust has been carefully managed with most of\nits income coming from forestry holdings, which the Fugger family favoured\nsince the 17th century after losing money on higher yielding investments. The\nannual return on the trust has ranged from an after-inflation rate of 0.5% to\n2%. The Fugger family foundation is currently headed by Maria-Elisabeth Gr\u00e4fin\nThun-Fugger, n\u00e9e Gr\u00e4fin Fugger von Kirchberg, who lives at Kirchberg Castle.\nOther members of the foundations's board are Alexander Graf Fugger-Babenhausen\nand Maria-Theresia Gr\u00e4fin Fugger-Gl\u00f6tt. All three still existing branches of\nthe Fugger family are thus represented.^[3] The trust is administered by Wolf-\nDietrich Graf von Hundt.^[2]\n\nAs of 2020, the fee for a tour into the Fuggerei is 6.50 euro, over seven\ntimes the annual rent.^[4]\n\n  * Gallery\n  * St. Mark's Church and Herrengasse\n\n  * Herrengasse\n\n  * Mittlere Gasse and well\n\n  * Exhibition apartment\n\n  * Exhibition in World War II air raid shelter\n\n  * Countess Elisabeth Thun-Fugger with Mikhail Gorbachev, 2005\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Beguinage - housing complex created to house lay religious women who have not taken vows.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Billock, Jennifer (19 December 2019). \"After Almost 500 Years, the World's Oldest Social Housing Complex Is Still Going Strong\".
