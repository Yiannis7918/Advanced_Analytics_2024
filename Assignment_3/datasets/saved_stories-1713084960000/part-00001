It\u2019s not pretty, but at the same time watching it in action is\nmesmerizing because everything our brains know about bikes tells us that\nseeing one rolling down the street without a rider should be impossible.\nWhat\u2019s more impressive is that the bike\u2019s upgraded capabilities come from a\nsingle hardware engineer named Zhi Hui Jun who realized the project in their\nspare time.\n\nThe self-balancing action is achieved through a perpendicularly-mounted heavy\nmetal wheel that can quickly change the direction of its spin to create\nangular momentum to counters the bike\u2019s tendency to immediately succumb to the\nforces of gravity and fall over. It\u2019s controlled by accelerometer and\ngyroscope sensors that can detect the subtlest movements of the bike, and as a\nresult, when self-balancing, the bike appears to be rock solid as the constant\ntiny adjustments being made are nearly imperceptible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Related Content\n\nThis Square-Wheeled Bicycle Works Like a Pedal-Powered Tank\n\nI Rode Specialized\u2019s Fancy New E-Bike, and Now I See the Light\n\nWagner Moura on Playing a Journalist in Civil War\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nWagner Moura on Playing a Journalist in Civil War\n\nThe mechanism should work whether or not there\u2019s a rider on the seat, but\nwhile it can keep the bike itself upright even at a complete stand-still, with\nsomeone on board, which adds a lot of top-heavy weight, it may require some\nadded forward momentum to help pull of its balancing tricks. It could very\nwell mean that one day the rite of passage of learning to ride a bike as a kid\ncould be no more, which would also make biking more accessible to riders of\nany skill level.\n\nThere\u2019s another interesting application to this creation, which may already be\napparent to anyone who lives in a big city and regularly has to dodge bicycle\ncouriers who deftly weave in and out of congested traffic to quickly deliver\npackages. As part of the upgrade, Zhi Hui Jun also added an RGB depth-sensing\ncamera and a LIDAR sensor allowing it to not only ride by itself but also\nintelligently avoid obstacles and navigate traffic. The bike could easily\nreplace the cars used by services like Uber Eats for smaller orders, and would\npotentially never be delayed by heavy traffic or closed roads. It could zip\nthrough pile-ups and even take advantage of shortcuts that cars never could to\nreduce delivery times\u2014while also reducing emissions.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
