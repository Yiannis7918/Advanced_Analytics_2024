The most you can normally ask\nof these sites, which are essentially online CVs, is an interface that is\npleasant to use. (Occasionally, you have a designer like Xingshan He or Dark\nIgloo, who incorporates gamified interactive elements, but the odds of\nbreaking the internet are slim.) Mauhan\u2019s website though, went viral when it\nwas published late last year.\n\nThe idea was to simulate a Google Meet \u2013 the site is essentially one long\n\u2018call\u2019 with Mauhan; users are asked to share permission to their own webcam,\nand are given a pre-recording of Mauhan in his living room in return. \u201cWe\nwanted to make people feel like Mauhan was constantly, directly, and somehow\nintimately available to them, even if he actually wasn\u2019t,\u201d says Francesca\nOddenino, co-founder of Vicine.\n\nThe UI design revolved around believability. Users can fire off custom emojis,\nopen up a chat bar, or hang-up the call and \u2013 except for the fact we\u2019re\nessentially just watching a video of Mauhan in his living room \u2013 the site does\nelicit the same feelings you get on a video call. When that red button is\nblinking you feel watched all the same. Francesca thinks that\u2019s part of the\nreason the website received the reaction it did.\n\nAbove\n\nVicine: mauhan.com (Copyright \u00a9 Vicine, 2024)\n\nOnce Mauhan shared the site, Vicine says \u201cengagement soared\u201d. The project\nreached a million impressions on Instagram within a few hours, helped by\nartists like Lil Yachty and 100 Gecs, who shared screengrabs of themselves on\nthe fake call. It also functioned as a powerful method of self-promotion;\nMauhan reported a sharp rise in inbound business and panel requests.\n\nFrancesca has a few predictions for why the humble profile site was such a\nsuccess. \u201cWhile we are used to binge watching people\u2019s lives, when it comes to\ndirect conversations there is still an \u2018opt-in\u2019 moment, a conscious decision\nthat needs to happen to start the communication. The site forces people to\nparticipate. Once you are in a 1-on-1 conversation (even if you later discover\nthat you are not really) you just cannot be passive.\u201d\n\n## GalleryVicine: mauhan.com (Copyright \u00a9 Vicine, 2024)\n\n### The Latest\n\nView more from\n\n  * Digital\n\n  * Firpal\u2019s lavish illustration work is folkloric and futuristic all at once\n  * Proto-typography: how type is dictated by the surface it\u2019s written on\n  * Shane Fu dives into his fantastical fungi and foliage AI creations\n  * Klara Graah\u2019s illustrations are full of funny quips and childlike charm\n  * Is Headspace XR really what Gen Z needs?\n\n### Hero Header\n\nVicine: mauhan.com (Copyright \u00a9 Vicine, 2024)\n\n### Share Article\n\n### Further Info\n\nvicinedesign.com\n\nmauhan.com\n\n### About the Author\n\nLiz Gorny\n\n\u2014\n\nLiz (she/they) joined It\u2019s Nice That as news writer in December 2021.
