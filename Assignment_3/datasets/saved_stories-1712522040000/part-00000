And the results are quite impressive. Using a Windows PC\nemulator running on the phone, Pavlov has tested dozens of games and recorded\nhow they performed, the settings used, and documented all of the tests in a\nspreadsheet. Some games, like GTA IV, run impressively well with the game\nhitting 60fps during gameplay. Other titles won\u2019t even start, like 2018\u2019s God\nof War on PC. And then you have a game like Red Dead Redemption II, which does\ntechnically run on the powerful phone (which is connected to an external\ncooler). However, don\u2019t expect 30fps or nice textures.\n\nSerg Pavlov / Rockstar Games\n\nAs spotted by VideoTech on Twitter, Pavlov has gotten Red Dead Redemption II\nrunning on the Red Magic Pro 9, but it\u2019s barely playable. In the videos\nshowcasing Rockstar\u2019s open-world game running on the device, you can regularly\nsee the performance dip into slideshow territory even with settings turned all\nthe way down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut this is in fact Red Dead Redemption II, the full game, running on a phone\nusing an emulator. Even if it runs poorly, it\u2019s still a cool proof of concept\nand a sign of how quickly phones are catching up to PCs and consoles in terms\nof raw power. As some commenters have pointed out, their older PCs can\u2019t even\nrun Red Dead Redemption II and yet this phone (sort of) can.\n\nSerg Pavlov / Rockstar Games\n\nWe\u2019ve seen Apple push harder and harder to bring big games like Resident Evil\nVillage and Death Stranding to newer iPhones with mixed results. It\u2019s clear\nthat phones, even the high-end and powerful ones, are still incapable of\nperfectly playing some of the biggest games released in the last few years.\nYet these tests Pavlov is uploading show that we might not be that far away\nfrom a big game like GTA 6 launching on consoles, PCs, and phones at the same\ntime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the very least, these videos have convinced me that Rockstar should release\na native version of Grand Theft Auto IV to the Google Play Store so fancier\nphones can play around with it and not have to mess with an emulator.\n\n.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
