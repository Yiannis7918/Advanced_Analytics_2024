The product, known\nas the Ultrastar Transporter, is a new Western Digital-built travel case that\nhouses a whopping 368TB of NVMe flash storage. The case is TAA compliant and\nhas a 12-core Intel Ice Lake server that houses all SSDs and dual 200Gb\nethernet ports.\n\nThe Ultrastar Transporter briefcase addresses high-performance, high-capacity\ndata transfers between server and edge locations. Western Digital reports that\ndemand is high for physical storage transport, particularly vast amounts of\ndata that would take days or weeks to transfer over the Internet. WD's new\ntravel case solves this problem by allowing users to transport vast data\nthrough good old physical transportation.\n\nImage 1 of 2\n\n(Image credit: Western Digital)\n\n(Image credit: Western Digital)\n\nA few examples include workloads where high-capacity data capture needs to be\nprocessed at one location from another. Another is the proliferation of multi-\ndatacenter workflows, where large data sets have to be held at multiple\nlocations and rapidly sent to those locations faster than what raw internet\nbandwidth can provide.\n\nThe Ultrastar Transporter has a rackmount server that holds all 368TB of NVMe\nflash storage to accommodate all that storage. The server features a 12-core\nIntel Ice Lake Xeon 4310 CPU, 128GB of DDR4 RDIMM memory, 1300W Titanium PSU,\nand dual 2TB SN740 NVMe SSDs in Raid 1, which serve as the boot drive. I/O\nconsists of dual 200GB ethernet ports, dual USB 3.0 ports, a DB9 serial port,\nand a VGA port. 7 PCIe Gen4 slots are located on the board, including four x16\nslots and three x8 slots. These PCIe slots connect all 368TB of SSD storage to\nthe system.\n\nThe case itself looks like a conventional carrying case. The outer shell\nappears to be hard plastic, with metal supporting rails filling the lips of\nthe case. The case features two latching mechanisms and a mechanism to attach\na lock for security. You can transport the travel case by rolling it on its\ntwo wheels or with another handle that allows you to carry it like a\nbriefcase.\n\n## Stay on the Cutting Edge\n\nJoin the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC\ntech news \u2014 and have for over 25 years.
