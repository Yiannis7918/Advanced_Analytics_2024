After being stranded for over a week, all three are safe,\naccording to the United States Coast Guard.\n\nThe three mariners, all men in their 40s, embarked on their voyage from\nPolowat Atoll in Micronesia on Easter Sunday in a small 20-foot open skiff\nequipped with an outboard motor and experience in navigating these waters, the\nCoast Guard release said.\n\nOn April 6, a Coast Guard unit in Guam received a distress call from a\nrelative of the three mariners reporting her three uncles had not returned\nfrom Pikelot Atoll, approximately 100 nautical miles northwest of Polowat\nAtoll.\n\nWatchstanders of this unit, the Joint Rescue Sub-Center (JRSC), immediately\nbegan coordinating a search and rescue operation. There were initial\ndifficulties in mobilizing air assets due to lack of availability, operational\ncommitments and weather conditions. Ultimately, the efforts led to the\nmobilization of a U.S. Navy P-8 crew from Kadena Air Force Base in Japan and\nthe diversion of the Coast Guard Cutter Oliver Henry. The initial search area\nspanned over 78,000 square nautical miles.\n\nThe mariners getting rescued from Pikelot Atoll, in Micronesia.US COAST GUARD\nFORCES MICRONESIA (EFE)\n\nThe breakthrough came when the U.S. Navy\u2019s P-8 Poseidon aircraft identified\nthe three sailors on April 7 at Pikelot Atoll, confirming their presence and\nstatus. \u201cIn a remarkable testament to their will to be found, the mariners\nspelled out \u2018HELP\u2019 on the beach using palm leaves, a crucial factor in their\ndiscovery. This act of ingenuity was pivotal in guiding rescue efforts\ndirectly to their location,\u201d said Lt. Chelsea Garcia, the search and rescue\nmission coordinator on the day they were located.\n\nThe aircraft crew successfully deployed survival packages to sustain the\nmariners until further assistance could arrive. USCGC Oliver Henry was\nrerouted to Pikelot Atoll to conduct the rescue operation. The crew of the\ncoast guard vessel met the sailors on the atoll on the morning of April 9,\nrescued the men and returned them to Polowat Atoll along with their skiff,\nwhich had sustained damage making its outboard engine non-functional.\n\nThis is the second rescue mission to take place in similar circumstances in a\nfew years in Pikelot. In August 2020, an SOS message written on the sand of\nthat same Pacific atoll was key in the rescue of three sailors who had been\nshipwrecked on the journey between Pulawat and Pulap atolls. They spent three\nnights and two days outdoors, but the pattern in the sand was enough for the\nCoast Guard to locate them and rescue them safe and sound.\n\nIn April 2016, three men were rescued from the small, uninhabited island of\nFanadik, also in Micronesia, after their boat sank almost four kilometers from\nthe coast. These castaways wrote a gigantic \u201cHELP\u201d with palm leaves and were\nrescued by the United States Navy three days later.\n\nIn August of that same year, a couple was rescued from the desert island of\nEast Fayu, also in Micronesia, after a U.S. Navy aircraft that flew over the\natoll read the SOS signal they had written in the sand.\n\nWith a primary presence in Guam and Saipan and over 300 members across Guam\nand the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Coast Guard\nForces Micronesia/Sector Guam team focuses on maritime safety, security, and\nstewardship in Oceania. They have search and rescue responsibility for\nmaritime events over more than 1.9 million square miles, including the\nFederated States of Micronesia.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage\nfrom EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition\n\n### More information\n\n### Survivors of Mediterranean rescue say about 60 people died on the trip\nfrom Libya\n\nAP\n\n### Italy works to transfer thousands of migrants who reached a tiny island in\na day\n\nAP | Lampedusa Island\n\n### Archived In\n\n  * Micronesia\n  * Guam\n\nAdheres to\n\nMore information\n\nIf you are interested in licensing this content, please contact\nventacontenidos@prisamedia.com\n\nSponsored Content\n\nSolaranlagen Magazin\n\nWahnsinn: Neue Solar-Erfindung f\u00fcr Hausbesitzer erobert\nDeutschlandSolaranlagen Magazin|\n\nPatrocinadoPatrocinado\n\nTreppenlift-Vergleich\n\nKein Scherz: So wenig kosten Treppenlifte 2024 wirklichTreppenlift-Vergleich|\n\nPatrocinadoPatrocinado\n\nForge Of Empires\n\nWenn du \u00fcber 45 Jahre alt bist, wirst du dieses Strategiespiel 2024\nliebenForge Of Empires|\n\nPatrocinadoPatrocinado\n\nAnd Also...\n\nThe bitter divorce of John Paulson, Donald Trump\u2019s tycoon friend and economic\nadvisorEl Pa\u00eds\n\nAS\n\nPrince William seen for first time since Kate Middleton cancer announcement:\nwhy did he attend Aston Villa game?AS\n\nAS\n\nWhat does FISA stand for?
