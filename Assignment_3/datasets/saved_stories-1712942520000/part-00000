Meta says that the die\nhas around 2.35B gates.\n\nMeta MTIA 2 Die\n\nThe chip is laid out with an 8\u00d78 matrix of processing elements, or PEs at the\ncenter. On the outer edge, there are other features like the host interface, a\nmemory controller for the LPDDR5 memory that sits around the accelerator, and\nthe fabric. We can also see a control core and decompression engine on the\ndiagram. At STH, we often discuss how much of a die is used for non-compute\ntasks. This is a great example since it is easy to see the PE versus non-PE\narea. It also shows just how much of AI-focused designs center around memory\nand data movement.\n\nMeta MTIA 2 Block Diagram\n\nThe MTIA 2 accelerators are packed into chassis and are very different than\nwhat NVIDIA is doing with its accelerators. Each board holds two 90W\naccelerators so it can be air-cooled. With a PCIe Gen5 x8 connection to the\nhost, the two accelerators can share a x16 edge connector. There are twelve\nboards in each chassis for 24 per chassis. Meta says that it deploys these in\nsets of three for 72 accelerators with an option for an RDMA NIC. Whereas we\nusually credit AWS Nitro for the interest in DPUs, Facebook/ Meta made a major\ninnovation years ago, deploying multi-host adapters at scale to lower\nnetworking costs. Here, the accelerator-to-NIC ratio seems to be much lower\nthan that of NVIDIA systems.\n\nMeta MTIA 2 System 72x Accelerator\n\nHere are the key specs from Meta on the accelerator\u2019s performance:\n\nGEMM TOPS\n\n  * 708 TFLOPS/s (INT8) (sparsity)\n  * 354 TFLOPS/s (INT8)\n  * 354 TFLOPS/s (FP16/BF16) (sparsity)\n  * 177 TFLOPS/s (FP16/BF16)\n\nSIMD TOPS\n\n  * Vector core:\n\n    * 11.06 TFLOPS/s (INT8),\n    * 5.53 TFLOPS/s (FP16/BF16),\n    * 2.76 TFLOPS/s (FP32)\n  * SIMD:\n\n    * 5.53 TFLOPS/s (INT8/FP16/BF16),\n    * 2.76 TFLOPS/s (FP32)\n\nMemory Capacity\n\n  * Local memory: 384 KB per PE\n  * On-chip memory: 256 MB\n  * Off-chip LPDDR5: 128 GB\n\nMemory Bandwidth\n\n  * Local memory: 1 TB/s per PE\n  * On-chip memory: 2.7 TB/s\n  * Off-chip LPDDR5: 204.8 GB/s (Source: Meta)\n\nSomething that stands out is the memory capacity to AI accelerator watt ratio.\nThe LPDDR5 memory may not offer huge amounts of bandwidth compared to HBM-\nbased accelerators, it offers relatively high capacity. Meta has something\nlike 128GB of memory / 90W TDP for about 1.42GB/W. Compare that to the Intel\nGaudi 3 we showed this week at 128GB of HBM2E and a 900W TDP that is\n0.142GB/W. It is clear that Meta is targeting a different memory capacity to\ncompute capacity ratio than many other chips we see.\n\n## Final Words\n\nMeta\u2019s post on MTIA 2 talks about hardware and software co-design. The company\nhas big enough applications where it can make dedicated accelerators. It feels\na bit like showing this off was less focused on the impact on production and\nmore focused on being a recruiting tool. Meta has been a leader in AI, and\nbuys a lot of compute and memory, so it makes a lot of sense that they are\nexploring different architectures.\n\n  * TAGS\n  * Meta\n  * MTIA\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nPinterest\n\nLinkedin\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\nCopy URL\n\nPrevious articleSupermicro X14 Servers Shown at Intel Vision 2024 Including a\nBig Surprise\n\nPatrick Kennedy\n\nhttps://www.servethehome.com\n\nPatrick has been running STH since 2009 and covers a wide variety of SME, SMB,\nand SOHO IT topics.
