Explain the 3 different scenarios, and how it\u2019ll affect them - the\ncompany going bankrupt, being sold for the current valuation, and being sold\nfor 10X.\n\nStock options help you align the employees' interests with the company's\nsuccess.\n\nPeople don\u2019t talk about stock options for multiple reasons:\n\n  1. The \u201cAssume your equity will be worth nothing\u201d mantra. Especially in 2024, people prefer to treat stock options as a lottery ticket and not as an investment.\n\n  2. All the (unneeded) secrecy around the compensation package - you are not allowed to talk about your salary and stock options with other employees, and in some places not even with your manager.\n\n  3. Companies make it hard to understand the value of your stock options.\n\nJennifer Kim (@jenistyping)\n\nand Marco Rogers had a great discussion about that topic, which inspired me to\nwrite this article.\n\nThey mentioned that it\u2019s our role as managers to:\n\n> ...Give people the info they need to think critically about equity. That\n> means thinking about the probability of options being worth a lot vs.\n> nothing vs. somewhere in the middle.\n>\n> Without equity, a startup job is just another job! Companies may see\n> employees walking away from equity as letting them keep more for themselves.\n> But this is terribly short-sighted, it takes away a major motivational\n> factor for employees to work hard and stick with the company.\n\nI\u2019m going to try to help you do that. You can also do your employees a favor,\nand just forward them this article :)\n\nBut first, a basic explanation of stock options:\n\n#\n\nStock Options 101\n\nFor a deeper explanation, read this article.\n\nEvery company, including private ones like startups, is divided into parts\ncalled shares. These shares represent ownership in the company. For example,\nif a company has 1,000 shares in total and you own 200 of them, you own 20% of\nthe company.\n\nStock options are a special deal companies offer to their employees, giving\nthem the right to buy shares at a specific price, known as the exercise price\n(or grant price/strike price), after a certain period has passed. This is a\nway for companies to reward employees and encourage them to stay longer and\nwork towards making the company more successful.\n\nIf the company's value increases, so does the value of its shares. This allows\nemployees to buy shares at the lower exercise price and potentially sell them\nat a higher market price, making a profit.\n\nStock options align the employees' interests with the company's success.\n\n#\n\nThe New Employee Conversation\n\nThe sad truth is that companies make it very hard for people to understand the\nnumbers behind stock options:\n\n> Marco: When employees try to learn more about equity, they can end up\n> feeling like they\u2019re not smart enough to understand the value of their\n> equity and I think that's on purpose.\n>\n> Jen: I know for a fact that recruiters at many companies don\u2019t want you to\n> ask too many questions.\n>\n> Marco: I would go even further than that \u2013 the information imbalance has the\n> deck stacked against employees. Companies don\u2019t provide all the information\n> that employees need to make informed decisions. So that\u2019s one reason people\n> simply opt out of the conversation altogether.\n\nWhen starting at a startup, an engineer usually gets a stock options grant,\nwith a 4-year vesting period, with 1-year cliff. What they don\u2019t know, is what\nthey\u2019ve actually got. What\u2019s the worth of those options?\n\nYou can help them with 3 simple questions:\n\nJoin 11,000+ readers for weekly articles on leading development teams!\n\n####\n\n1\\. Do they know the exercise price?\n\nThis is the basic value they\u2019ll need for any future discussion. What is the\nprice they\u2019ll need to pay to buy the share?\n\nIn some companies, the initial job contracts are misleading, and mention a\nnominal price of $0.01. In reality, when you get the option grant contract\n(usually after the next board meeting), it\u2019s a higher value.\n\n####\n\n2\\. Do they know the current price of each share?\n\nIn my opinion, this should be discussed during the contract phase, but this is\nrarely the case, as companies deem it private information.\n\nThe crazy part is that even after you join - if you don\u2019t ask, nobody will\ntell you.\n\nThis information can help you understand if you are \u2018in the money\u2019 - meaning\nthe exercise price is lower than the current share price.\n\n####\n\n3\\. Do they know what they stand to gain in a liquidation event?\n\nA liquidation event = an Acquisition / Merge / IPO / Secondary sale.\n\nYou can play out a hypothetical scenario with them, just to explain the\nconcept: \u201cLet\u2019s you got 1000 options, with an exercise price of $10, and the\ncurrent share price is $15.\u201d\n\n  * What can they gain if they sell for the current share price? - They\u2019ll need to pay $10K, and will get $15K - a $5K profit.\n\n  * What will they gain in the 10X scenario? - They\u2019ll pay the same $10K, but will get $150K - a $140K profit. Note that the bigger the company grows, the less impact the exercise price has. This calculation doesn\u2019t take into account the dilution during future funding rounds.\n\n####\n\nAre they excited about the 10X scenario?\n\nIf after having this conversation, the employee is left with the feeling:\n\u201dhmmm, even in the 10X scenario that\u2019s not too much, I thought I\u2019d make more\u201d\n- you need to discuss it with your manager. Maybe you need to offer better\npackages.\n\nThis article offers a valuable perspective to see if your company is good at\nincentivizing employees:\n\n###\n\nA Tenured/Promoted Employee\n\nI\u2019ll not get too deep into that, if you want to read about the best practices\nof additional stock options grants, go read the article mentioned above.\n\nJust make sure you have a grasp of how it works in your company. You\u2019ll be\nsurprised how much you can affect those things.\n\n#\n\nA Leaving Employee\n\nMarco shared his story in the article:\n\n> After Yammer, I joined another startup as the first engineer, and I ended up\n> vesting quite a bit of equity. When it was time to leave, I had some very\n> serious conversations with my family. We made the bet and put down a lot of\n> money to exercise, then spent 3.5 years waiting. Finally, the news came that\n> the company was going public, and I got an even bigger check than I had from\n> Yammer. I started reconnecting with coworkers and it was... heartbreaking.\n>\n> Just heartbreaking. People told me, \u201cI didn't understand equity, it seemed\n> too expensive to exercise, so I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d It\u2019s tough, because the\n> period I worked for that company was pretty grueling, but I can tell you\n> what makes up for it: money. Money makes up for a lot of regret. It really\n> solidified the stance that I'm laying out right now, which is that you can't\n> ignore the value of equity.\n\nDo NOT take this story as advice that you should tell your employees to always\nexercise their options! That is definitely not the case.\n\nThe lesson is that most people approach this decision in ignorance. They think\nsomething along the lines of: \u201cI need to pay $30K to exercise my options. The\nchances of actually seeing money from it are very low, so it\u2019s not worth that\nmoney\u201d.\n\nLet\u2019s say your employee vested 1000 shares, with an exercise price of $30 for\neach. So to exercise (=buy) all of them, they\u2019ll need to spend $30K, not a\nsmall sum.\n\nIn my opinion, it\u2019s our job as managers to help them make the right decision,\nfor THEM.\n\nWhat do they need to consider before making the decision:\n\n####\n\n1\\. What is the current share price?\n\nSimilar to the question in the first section - this is the most critical\nquestion, it is the value the investors in the last round paid for their\nshares.\n\nThere is a HUGE difference between these 2 cases:\n\n  * A current share price of $50, which prices your shares at $50K. In this case, if you don\u2019t buy the shares, you are leaving $20K \u2018on the table\u2019.\n\n  * A current share price of $300. In this case, your shares are priced at $300K right now, and you\u2019ll be leaving $270K \u2018on the table\u2019.\n\n####\n\n2\\. What is the company\u2019s chance of success?\n\nAs an insider, people think they have better knowledge, but usually, they just\nget emotionally involved in the decision. I don\u2019t have data to back that up,\nbut I\u2019m sure that employees that were fired, are much less likely to exercise\ntheir options. Their logic could be \u201cIf this company chose to fire a great\nemployee like me, there is no chance they\u2019ll succeed\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s much better to use cold data and take into account the stage of the\ncompany. This is just an example, you don\u2019t really need exact numbers:\n\nSource: this article\n\n####\n\n3\\. What are you willing to spend on the investment?\n\nBuying your shares is NOT a bet, but an investment. The employee needs to\ndecide if they want to make it, and how much to spend on it.\n\nIt\u2019s not all-or-nothing! They can buy just some of their shares. If they are\nnot willing to spend any money, they can use companies such as Equitybee,\nwhich lets \u201cyou exercise your stock options with no out-of-pocket cost so you\ncan profit from a future IPO.\u201d [Not sponsored, and I\u2019ve never tried them].\n\n##\n\nCombining it all for a final decision\n\nOnce they have the information, they need to consider 3 options:\n\n  1. You will lose 100% of your investment - the most likely option. Will you be angry at yourself for spending that money? Will it create a conflict in the family? Or will you be able to brush it off?\n\n  2. The company will be sold close to the current value - how much will you make?\n\n  3. The company will be sold for 10x the current value - how will you feel if won\u2019t be a part of it? Is it a life-changing event, and you will regret it your whole life?\n\nIn the end, only the employee can make that decision, but you can provide A\nLOT of help in gathering the information and laying out the facts.\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand that this could be one of the most critical\ninvestment decisions the employee will make their whole life. And as such, it\nneeds to be considered carefully. I would even go as far as to recommend\ntalking to a financial advisor for personalized advice.\n\n##\n\nFinal Words\n\nI know that most people think that I went a little overboard with the guidance\nto employees. Until the companies do a better job of it, and there will be\nbetter education and common knowledge - I think it\u2019s our job as managers to\nfill the gaps.\n\nIf the subjects of stocks, VCs, and money interest you, I recommend you\nsubscribe to\n\nOnlyCFO\n\nand\n\nData-driven VC\n\n.\n\n###\n\nWhat I enjoyed reading this week\n\n  * This is BY FAR the best article I\u2019ve read on 1:1 meetings, by\n\nMichael Lopp\n\n  * What we should do to make our teams miserable (the inversion mental model) by\n\nMicha\u0142 Poczwardowski\n\n  * The multiple forms of leadership - Manager, Leader, Mentor, by\n\nSamuel Koll\u00e1t\n\n### Subscribe to Leading Developers\n\nBy Anton Zaides \u00b7 Launched 8 months ago\n\nJoin 11,000+ software leaders for free weekly articles on managing and growing\na development team!\n\n25 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n4 Restacks\n\n25\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Guide to Stock Options conversations\n\nzaidesanton.substack.com\n\n4\n\nShare\n\n4 Comments\n\nSamuel Koll\u00e1tEnginuityMar 26Liked by Anton ZaidesThank you so much for the\nmention, Anton!
