Despite having less than 5 per cent of\nthe global population, the US possesses nearly half of the world\u2019s civilian-\nowned guns. Moreover, in recent years Americans have witnessed a surge in gun\nsales and gun-related deaths, unfolding against a backdrop of increasingly\nlenient gun laws across states.\n\nIn light of these developments, Hofstadter\u2019s question takes on renewed\nurgency: \u2018Why is it that in all other modern democratic societies those\nendangered ask to have such men disarmed, while in the United States alone\nthey insist on arming themselves?\u2019 How did the US come to be so terribly\nexceptional with regards to its guns?\n\nFrom the viewpoint of today, it is difficult to imagine a world in which guns\nwere less central to US life. But a gun-filled country was neither innate nor\ninevitable. The evidence points to a key turning point in US gun culture\naround the mid-20th century, shortly before the state of gun politics captured\nHofstadter\u2019s attention.\n\nFirearm estimates derived from gun sales and surveys indicate that, in 1945,\nthere were somewhere around 45 million guns in the US at a time when the\ncountry had 140 million people. A quarter-century later, by 1970, the number\nof guns doubled, whereas the population increased by a little less than 50 per\ncent. By 2020, the number of guns had skyrocketed to nearly tenfold of its\n1945 rate, while the population grew less than 2.5 times the 1945 number.\n\nFrom the mid-20th century to today, guns also changed from playing a\nrelatively minor role in US crime to taking centre-stage. Research by the\ncriminologist Martin Wolfgang on Philadelphia\u2019s homicide patterns from 1948 to\n1952 reveals that only 33 per cent of the city\u2019s homicides involved a firearm.\nToday, 91 per cent of homicides in Philadelphia feature a gun. Similarly, the\nnational firearm homicide rate is 81 per cent. In addition, opinion polls\ntraced the evolution over the second half of the 20th century from Americans\nbuying guns primarily for hunting and recreation to buying them for self-\nprotection against other people. Together, these findings reveal a sea change\nin US gun culture between the mid-20th century and the present day.\n\nUS law prohibits the federal government from keeping a gun registry\n\nSo, how did this change happen? Until recently, it\u2019s been difficult to say.\nThe paucity of historical data on gun availability has left the origins of the\ncountry\u2019s exceptional gun culture a mystery.\n\nThe US lacks a national gun registry, which is what most other countries use\nto count their gun supply. Yet, gun registration has been a hotly contested\nissue among US gun owners, who are concerned that state-mandated registration\nis a precursor to state-sponsored confiscation. Even though gun registries\nhave been shown to reduce gun deaths, US law \u2013 specifically, the 1986 Firearm\nOwners\u2019 Protection Act passed under the then president Ronald Reagan \u2013\nprohibits the federal government from keeping a registry. As of today, only\nsix US states maintain gun registries.\n\nWithout a national gun registry, researchers have had to rely on surveys and\ngun proxies to investigate trends related to gun availability in the US. Most\nof our existing data on gun prevalence comes from a few questions on the\nGeneral Social Survey (GSS), which began asking US households whether they own\nguns in 1973 and has continued asking them every other year since. Due to its\nconsistency over time and its nationally representative sample, the GSS is\nconsidered the gold standard of gun ownership data. It\u2019s also been used to\nvalidate proxies for gun ownership that provide better estimates at local and\nstate levels. Some of the most commonly used gun proxies come from hunting\nlicences and Guns & Ammo magazine subscriptions per county, as well as the\npercentage of suicides with firearms per state.\n\nAnnual gun sales give us another indicator of the flow of guns into the\ncountry, but since it\u2019s impossible to tell where those guns end up or for how\nlong they\u2019re in use, gun sales provide an imperfect measure of ownership over\ntime. Moreover, gun sales data are consistently available only at the national\nlevel, and therefore do not allow researchers to exploit state- or county-\nlevel differences to explore how changes in gun ownership are related to other\nsocial factors like crime, education and public policy across the country.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder that when a National Research Council committee reviewed the\nstate of research on US guns and violence in 2005, it found that \u2018answers to\nsome of the most pressing questions cannot be addressed with existing data.\u2019\nThe best data available start in 1973 and are \u2018limited primarily to a few\nquestions from the General Social Survey.\u2019 As the committee rightly pointed\nout:\n\n> Even the best methods cannot overcome inadequate data ... Without\n> improvements in this situation, the substantive questions in the field about\n> the role of guns in suicide, homicide and other crimes, and accidental\n> injury are likely to continue to be debated on the basis of conflicting\n> empirical findings.\n\nIn other words, without the right data, even the most basic questions about\nguns \u2013 such as when and how the US came to have so many of them \u2013 are\nuntestable and remain susceptible to politicised perspectives and speculative\ninterpretations.\n\nHowever, recent research conducted by Elizabeth Rasich and myself breaks new\nground by expanding the data to tackle key questions of gun ownership.\nResearchers have long used the firearm suicide proxy, regarded as the most\nreliable indicator of US households with at least one gun, to explore the\nconnection between gun ownership and various issues, including the social\ncosts of firearms, police brutality and mass shootings. Until our newly\nextended dataset, this proxy was available only from 1973 onward, a time by\nwhich the country\u2019s gun culture was already in full swing.\n\nBy extending and examining this data for household gun ownership rates \u2013 the\npercentage of suicides with a firearm \u2013 we sought to illuminate the enigma of\nthe origins of the distinct gun culture in the US. The key to understanding\nthe inception of this cultural transformation lay in accessing data on gun\nownership in earlier decades. While digging in the historical records, we\nfound that the data on firearm suicides go back to 1949, which is the first\nyear the US vital statistics included information about suicides by gun. We\nhand-digitised the firearm suicide counts for each state and each year from\n1949 to 1972, validated the data through a series of statistical tests and, in\ndoing so, created what is now the longest-ranging dataset on state-level gun\nownership rates to date.\n\nWith the right data in hand, we turned to our next task \u2013 making sense of the\nexceptionally high gun ownership rates among Americans. When trying to figure\nout when and how the country acquired so many guns, we initially thought the\nanswer may lie in the civil unrest and rising crime rates of the 1960s and\n\u201970s. Instead, we found a trajectory dating back to the mid-20th century.\n\nEarly gun culture was utilitarian, collective and state-directed\n\nConventional wisdom holds that the ample supply of guns has always been part\nof the US tradition, with consumer demand steadily meeting it. Hofstadter\nthought this might have to do with the \u2018American historical mythology about\nthe protective value of guns\u2019 as \u2018an important counterpoise to tyranny\u2019.\nIndeed, guns helped Americans secure their independence and expand the western\nfrontier across North America. As many know, the right of Americans to keep\nand bear arms is, of course, enshrined in the US constitution.\n\nIt\u2019s true that guns have been present in the US since its inception, initially\nserving as tools of necessity in the colonies and on the frontier. They\u2019ve\nplayed a key role in American imagination, culture and politics. However, in\nthe past half-century, US gun culture has witnessed an unequivocal\ntransformation. The historian Brian DeLay contends that the idea of a\ncontinuous gun culture in the US is a myth. His work shows that early gun\nculture was utilitarian, collective and state-directed; whereas in the past\nhalf-century, the emergence of new gun technologies, such as assault weapons,\nalong with a shift towards self-defensive uses of guns, have come to define\ncontemporary US gun culture. These developments have led gun experts like the\nsociologist David Yamane to identify the rise of \u2018Gun Culture 2.0\u2019 or the\n\u2018culture of armed citizenship\u2019 as a modern phenomenon rather than an endemic\nnational trait.\n\nAn alternative explanation for the exceptional gun rates in the US centres on\nthe surge of crime and civil unrest in the late 1960s to \u201970s \u2013 a period\ncoinciding with Hofstadter\u2019s writing and a national uptick in crime. According\nto this perspective, the rapid rise in gun ownership rates over the past half-\ncentury is a result of escalating crime rates and eroding trust in\ninstitutions. This narrative pins the turning point of US gun culture on the\nspread of urban violence and the fraying of public confidence in government\namid the Vietnam War, which encouraged people to put safety in their own\nhands, or so the story goes.\n\nWhile an increase in crime and a decline in trust in the US government may\nhave contributed to the surge in gun demand, this can\u2019t be the full story.\nIt\u2019s true that the US gun stock rapidly rose during this period, however\nhistorical data from the US Department of Justice indicates that the rate of\nfamilies reporting gun ownership remained stable or even declined during the\n1960s and early \u201970s. Moreover, our newly compiled gun ownership data going\nback to 1949 further challenge this explanation, pointing to an inflection\npoint in earlier decades.\n\nTo understand the real origins of the exceptional gun culture of the US, we\nneeded to look further back in time. Our research reveals a puzzling new\ntrajectory: a remarkable 45 per cent increase in the household gun ownership\nrate from 1949 to 1990, peaking during 1990. To our surprise, more than half\nof this rise occurred before 1973, a period previously obscured by the lack of\nsystematic data on gun prevalence. These new data provide a crucial historical\nperspective, showing that the surge in gun prevalence started before the\nperiod marked by rising crime and falling trust. In fact, our measure shows an\nuptick in gun prevalence beginning in the 1950s, a period defined by low\nhomicide rates and peak trust in government, prompting questions about why and\nhow more households acquired guns during a period of relative calm.\n\nFirearm suicide proxy for household gun ownership (FSS), homicide rate, and\nfirearm homicide rate, 1949 to 2020. National gun ownership rates \u2013 as\nmeasured by the firearm suicide divided by suicide (FSS) proxy \u2013 have moved in\ntandem with homicide and firearm homicide rates per 100,000 people for most\nyears between 1949 and 2020. According to the FSS proxy, household gun\nownership rates increased by 45 per cent between 1949 and 1990, the country\u2019s\npeak. More than half of that increase occurred between 1949 and 1972, the data\nleft of the vertical dotted line, the period in which researchers previously\nlacked data on household gun ownership rates\n\nWe examined the factors that were most connected to state-level increases in\nthese rates from 1949 to 1990, the decades in which household gun ownership\nsteadily rose and when the exceptional US gun culture took shape. We tested\nseveral different variables that could have contributed to this rise \u2013\nincluding demographic shifts, rising crime, racial conflicts, changes in\neducation and civil unrest, among others. We controlled for state and year\ndifferences within our sample, as is convention in scientific studies on gun\nownership over time, to ensure that we weren\u2019t comparing states with other\nstates that have drastically different populations and gun traditions, or that\nthe results weren\u2019t skewed by specific years that were outliers in the data.\n\nThey mass-marketed these imported guns to consumers flush with cash\n\nOf all the potential explanations we tested, we discovered that the post-\nSecond World War economic boom and relaxed federal gun regulations most drove\nthe surge in demand for guns. As unemployment rates decreased and incomes\nincreased, firearms \u2013 once deemed a luxury or practical necessity \u2013 grew\nwithin reach for more and more Americans. Simultaneously, cultural attitudes\nsurrounding gun ownership may have shifted, as multiple generations of\nAmericans returning from the Second World War, the Korean War and the Vietnam\nWar became accustomed to owning and using guns.\n\nIn his book Gun Country (2023), the historian Andrew McKevitt complements\nthese findings with a rich tapestry of archival evidence. By weaving together\ngun advertisements, congressional hearings and journalistic sources, among\nothers, McKevitt illustrates that US gun culture is unequivocally modern,\nspecifically emerging post-1945, and from the aftermath of the Second World\nWar and the start of Cold War politics.\n\nFollowing the global demobilisation in 1945, McKevitt shows, surplus war\nfirearms flooded the US market at dirt-cheap prices. This influx was\nfacilitated by the \u2018new gun capitalists\u2019, a group of little-known\nentrepreneurs who imported and sold these guns to US consumers. They reshaped\nthe US gun industry by establishing a mass market for civilian guns that had\nlimited practical use elsewhere and faced stricter regulations in other\ncountries. Capitalising on the surplus of inexpensive imported firearms, the\nnew gun capitalists learned how to stimulate demand through marketing foreign\nguns as desirable consumer goods for the everyday American. They mass-marketed\nthese imported guns to consumers flush with cash and eager to acquire these\none-of-a-kind war arms from across the globe.\n\nMagazine advertisements for mail-in orders of inexpensive guns targeted new\nbuyers who couldn\u2019t afford the high prices of name-brand US firearms. These\nads leveraged the appeal of vintage guns as \u2018authentic World War II souvenirs\u2019\nfrom Germany, Spain, Russia, Czechoslovakia, Japan and other war-torn\ncountries. Post-Second World War ads can be found touting guns as among the\n\u2018finest made by the Fascists. Carried by the crack Italian Alpine troops.\u2019 The\nvery gun used by Lee Harvey Oswald to assassinate the president John F Kennedy\nwas an Italian rifle purchased from a Chicago mail-order store.\n\nFrom an issue of Punch and Judy Comics; Volume 3, October 1947. Courtesy\nWikimedia\n\nSeeking to safeguard retail prices from this new supply of foreign guns, the\nUS gun industry pursued federal action to curb the unregulated flow of\nimported firearms. However, the administration of the president Dwight\nEisenhower decided that redirecting global gun stockpiles into the US was\npreferable to them arming communist insurgents worldwide. It was the Kennedy\nassassination, alongside rising crime rates across US cities, that finally\nprompted Congress to act. The senator Thomas Dodd introduced a bill in 1963\naimed at restricting mail-order firearms. These efforts culminated in the Gun\nControl Act of 1968, one of the most significant pieces of gun legislation in\nUS history.\n\nWhen considering explanations for Americans\u2019 unique gun culture, Hofstadter\nthought that perhaps it emerged from the enduring national idea that access to\narms counters tyranny. He was partly right. As the new historical evidence\nshows, it was post-Second World War economic prosperity, abundant supply of\ncheap guns, along with increased incomes, that made way for the unique gun\nculture of the US. Once that gun culture took root, it flourished, helped\nalong by public policy. Hofstadter\u2019s theory is consistent with the fact that\nthe steady rise in gun prevalence from 1949 to 1990 was made possible by\nlenient regulations, upheld by voters who saw gun rights as a symbol of\nfreedom and the right to self-defence.\n\nWith the extended data, we can see that Hofstadter wrote at a key moment in\nthe US history of guns. For much of US history, guns were used mainly for\nrecreation and hunting, but during the Cold War the nation turned towards a\nnew era of gun culture. Hofstadter died in 1970, the same year as he wrote his\npiece on guns. He did not live to see the transformation in the ethos around\ngun ownership to one of celebration that carries on to the present day.\n\nHofstadter believed Americans armed themselves against tyranny from above, but\ntoday\u2019s reality is different. Guns, primarily used for hunting and sport in\nthe mid-20th century, became largely owned for protection against fellow\ncivilians \u2013 a reflection of a modern fear, the tyranny of uncertainty from\neach other.\n\nIn a country in which tens of millions of people own guns, public safety\nbecomes a personal responsibility, and so individuals often decide that it is\nin their best interest to protect themselves by buying a gun. This desire to\nbe protected against those who have guns by getting a gun, multiplied across\nmillions of people, has resulted in an arms race that makes everyone less\nsafe. Historical events along with policy choices have shaped this explosion\nin gun ownership, leading to a society in which many people have grown to\nassociate guns with a sense of personal security. As a result, we hear all the\ntime about guns being used in shared spaces of learning, worship and leisure.\n\nState intervention to restrict gun availability can make a significant\ndifference\n\nIn 1970, when thinking about how personal and political conflicts unfold in a\nnation with so many guns, Hofstadter asked: \u2018How far must things go?\u2019 Now, 54\nyears later, we can answer his question. In 2021, the US witnessed its highest\nnumber of gun deaths ever and, in 2023, its deadliest year for mass shootings.\nAlarming new trends include the rise of ghost guns \u2013 homemade guns made from\nunserialised parts, making them difficult to trace and regulate \u2013 and the\nincreasing prevalence of military-grade automatic weapons in civilian hands.\nGun ownership is only increasing, with one in five US households having\npurchased a gun during the COVID-19 pandemic, and new gun owners diversifying\nto include more women and people of colour. My friend Charles, a street\noutreach worker in Chicago who works with violence-involved youth, aptly\nsummarised the situation: \u2018The answer to more guns is more guns.\u2019\n\nThis cycle of guns begetting more guns risks becoming the norm, unless there\nis concerted state action to reverse the trend. Research shows that state\nintervention to restrict gun availability can make a significant difference.\nBy the 1990s, unprecedented crime rates prompted many US states to adopt gun\nrestrictions that resulted in a substantial reduction in gun availability and\nsaved tens of thousands of lives. Moreover, mass shootings in Australia,\nCanada and the United Kingdom motivated their governments to implement\ncommonsense gun regulations, including bans on automatic weapons and\nrequirements for licensing and registration. The success of these\ninterventions offers hope that the current situation is not immutable.\nHowever, despite this progress, recent years have witnessed a reversal in both\nstate and federal gun-control efforts. Some states have eased or repealed\nlaws, and in 2022 the US Supreme Court limited states\u2019 ability to restrict gun\naccess. This has likely contributed to the recent surge in firearm deaths,\nparticularly among Black Americans.\n\nExamining US history helps provide insights into the present. The recent spike\nin gun sales and the easing of firearm restrictions across the US warrant our\nattention, carrying implications that transcend generations and borders. Guns\nacquired during the 1990s crime surge have remained in communities with\nconsequences for current generations, and account for one-10th of the life-\nexpectancy gap between white and Black males today. Porous state borders\nenable the movement of guns from lenient jurisdictions to regions with\nstricter laws and elevated crime rates.\n\nToday, Americans stand at a critical juncture, facing the consequences of a\nnation armed against outsiders and one another alike. To tackle this issue,\nindividuals must reject the premise that more guns equate to greater safety.\nGuns, lasting for more than a century, extend their impact beyond individual\nhouseholds, affecting the collective wellbeing of communities. The\nprioritisation of individual gun rights in the US over community safety has\nbecome a danger to innocents. Americans are locked in a self-perpetuating arms\nrace that makes all of us only less safe. The exceptional gun culture of the\nUS demands a critical reassessment of the nation\u2019s priorities and policies to\nensure a safer future \u2013 one in which it\u2019s known for something other than guns.\n\nWar and peaceHistory of technologyNations and empires\n\n9 April 2024\n\nEmail\n\nSave\n\nPost\n\nShare\n\nSyndicate this essay\n\nSave\n\nessay\n\nReligion\n\nConscientious unbelievers\n\nHow, a century ago, radical freethinkers quietly and persistently subverted\nScotland\u2019s Christian establishment\n\nFelicity Loughlin\n\nSave\n\nessay\n\nEthics\n\nThe scourge of lookism\n\nIt is time to take seriously the painful consequences of appearance\ndiscrimination in the workplace\n\nAndrew Mason\n\nSave\n\nessay\n\nEconomic history\n\nThe southern gap\n\nIn the American South, an oligarchy of planters enriched itself through\nslavery.
