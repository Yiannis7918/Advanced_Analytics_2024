It's a place where big names and small names can combine their\nefforts and create something together.\n\nI'll accept a huge range of submissions, from the serious to the silly \u2014 as\nlong as you put your heart into it and express yourself.\n\nIf your work is usually serious and academic, this is a chance for you to do\nsomething more creative and fun. If your work is usually small and\nlighthearted, this is a chance for you to do something big and important. Here\nare some words for your moodboard:\n\n  * good\n  * short\n  * surrealist\n  * no ideas\n  * express yourself\n\n## Format\n\nYour submission needs the following things.\n\n  * Your full name.\n  * A photo of your face.\n  * The title of your piece.\n  * The piece itself.\n  * An audio recording of you reading the content of your submission, including you name and the title of your piece. (ad libs are allowed). If your submission contains something that can't be read, describe that part.\n  * (Optional) Instructions on how you want your submission to be displayed (eg: background colour, font, layout, max width, any images, interactive parts, etc). This can include how your name and title and audio recording are displayed as well. You can write this down in words, or you can send an image/video of a mockup. If you know how, you can write some markdown and/or HTML and/or CSS and/or javascript, and I'll try to make it work. If you don't care how it's displayed, you can leave this section blank, and I'll do something that feels fitting to your piece.\n\nYour photo, name and audio will be displayed alongside your piece.\n\nIf your submission is accepted, it will be published under the Creative\nCommons Attribution 4.0 International License.\n\n## Submit now\n\nSend your submission (and any further questions) to todepond@gmail.com\n\n", "frontpage": false}
