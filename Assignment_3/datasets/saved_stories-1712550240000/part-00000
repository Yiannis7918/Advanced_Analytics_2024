Saved Ethernet\n\n##\n\nTheir groundbreaking learning bridge technology increased LAN performance\n\nAlan Kirby\n\n5 hours ago\n\n7 min read\n\nMark Kempf [left] and Alan Kirby with the logic module in the LANBridge 100.\n\nAlan Kirby\n\nI\u2019ve enjoyed reading magazine articles about Ethernet\u2019s 50th anniversary,\nincluding one in the The Institute. Invented by computer scientists Robert\nMetcalfe and David Boggs, Ethernet has been extraordinarily impactful.\nMetcalfe, an IEEE Fellow, received the 1996 IEEE Medal of Honor as well as the\n2022 Turing Award from the Association for Computing Machinery for his work.\nBut there is more to the story that is not widely known.\n\nDuring the 1980s and early 1990s, I led Digital Equipment Corp.\u2019s networking\nadvanced development group in Massachusetts. I was a firsthand witness in what\nwas a period of great opportunity for LAN technologies and intense competition\nbetween standardization efforts.\n\nDEC, Intel, and Xerox poised themselves to profit from Ethernet\u2019s launch in\nthe 1970s. But during the 1980s other LAN technologies emerged as competitors.\nPrime contenders included the token ring, promoted by IBM, and the token bus.\n(Today Ethernet and both token-based technologies are part of the IEEE 802\nfamily of standards.)\n\nAll those LANs have some basic parts in common. One is the 48-bit media access\ncontrol (MAC) address, a unique number assigned during a computer\u2019s network\nport manufacturing process. The MAC addresses are used inside the LAN only,\nbut they are critical to its operation. And usually, along with the general-\npurpose computers on the network, they have at least one special-purpose\ncomputer: a router, whose main job is to send data to\u2014and receive it from\u2014the\nInternet on behalf of all the other computers on the LAN.\n\nIn a decades-old conceptual model of networking, the LAN itself (the wires and\nlow-level hardware) is referred to as Layer 2, or the data link layer. Routers\nmostly deal with another kind of address: a network address that is used both\nwithin the LAN and outside it. Many readers likely have heard the terms\nInternet Protocol and IP address. With some exceptions, the IP address (a\nnetwork address) in a data packet is sufficient to ensure that packet can be\ndelivered anywhere on the Internet by a sequence of other routers operated by\nservice providers and carriers. Routers and the operations they perform are\nreferred to as Layer 3, or the network layer.\n\nIn a token ring LAN, shielded twisted-pair copper wires connect each computer\nto its upstream and downstream neighbors in an endless ring structure. Each\ncomputer forwards data from its upstream neighbor to its downstream one but\ncan send its own data to the network only after it receives a short data\npacket\u2014a token\u2014from the upstream neighbor. If it has no data to transmit, it\njust passes the token to its downstream neighbor, and so on.\n\nIn a token bus LAN, a coaxial cable connects all the network\u2019s computers, but\nthe wiring doesn\u2019t control the order in which the computers pass the token.\nThe computers agree on the sequence in which they pass the token, forming an\nendless virtual ring around which data and tokens circulate.\n\nEthernet, meanwhile, had become synonymous with coaxial cable connections that\nused a method called carrier sense multiple access with collision detection\nfor managing transmissions. In the CSMA/CD method, computers that want to\ntransmit a data packet first listen to see if another computer is\ntransmitting. If not, the computer sends its packet while listening to\ndetermine whether that packet collides with one from another computer.\nCollisions can happen because signal propagation between computers is not\ninstantaneous. In the case of a collision, the sending computer resends its\npacket with a delay that has both a random component and an exponentially\nincreasing component that depends on the number of collisions.\n\nThe need to detect collisions involves tradeoffs among data rate, physical\nlength, and minimum packet size. Increasing the data rate by an order of\nmagnitude means either reducing the physical length or increasing the minimum\npacket size by roughly the same factor. The designers of Ethernet had wisely\nchosen a sweet spot among the tradeoffs: 10 megabits per second and a length\nof 1,500 meters.\n\n## A threat from fiber\n\nMeanwhile, a coalition of companies\u2014including my employer, DEC\u2014was developing\na new ANSI LAN standard: the Fiber Distributed Data Interface. The FDDI\napproach used a variation of the token bus protocol to transmit data over\noptical fiber, promising speeds of 100 Mb/s, far faster than Ethernet\u2019s 10\nMb/s.\n\nA barrage of technical publications released analyses of the throughputs and\nlatencies of competing LAN technologies under various workloads. Given the\nresults and the much greater network performance demands expected from\nspeedier processors, RAM, and nonvolatile storage, Ethernet\u2019s limited\nperformance was a serious problem.\n\nFDDI seemed a better bet for creating higher speed LANs than Ethernet,\nalthough FDDI used expensive components and complex technology, especially for\nfault recovery. But all shared media access protocols had one or more\nunattractive features or performance limitations, thanks to the complexity\ninvolved in sharing a wire or optical fiber.\n\n## A solution emerges\n\nI thought that a better approach than either FDDI or a faster version of\nEthernet would be to develop a LAN technology that performed store-and-forward\nswitching.\n\nOne evening in 1983, just before leaving work to go home, I visited the office\nof Mark Kempf, a principal engineer and a member of my team. Mark, one of the\nbest engineers I have ever worked with, had designed the popular and\nprofitable DECServer 100 terminal server, which used the local-area transport\n(LAT) protocol created by Bruce Mann from DEC\u2019s corporate architecture group.\nTerminal servers connect groups of dumb terminals, with only RS-232 serial\nports, to computer systems with Ethernet ports.\n\nI told Mark about my idea of using store-and-forward switching to increase LAN\nperformance.\n\nThe next morning he came in with an idea for a learning bridge (also known as\na Layer 2 switch or simply a switch). The bridge would connect to two Ethernet\nLANs. By listening to all traffic on each LAN, the device would learn the MAC\naddresses of the computers on both Ethernets (remembering which computer was\non which Ethernet) and then selectively forward the appropriate packets\nbetween the LANs based upon the destination MAC address. The computers on the\ntwo networks didn\u2019t need to know which path their data would take on the\nextended LAN; to them, the bridge was invisible.\n\nThe bridge would need to receive and process some 30,000 packets per second\n(15,000 pp/s per Ethernet) and decide whether to forward each one. Although\nthe 30,000 pp/s requirement was near the limit of what could be done using the\nbest microprocessor technology of the time, the Motorola 68000, Mark was\nconfident he could build a two-Ethernet bridge using only off-the-shelf\ncomponents including a specialized hardware engine he would design using\nprogrammable array logic (PAL) devices and dedicated static RAM to look up the\n48-bit MAC addresses.\n\nMark\u2019s contributions have not been widely recognized. One exception is the\ntextbook Network Algorithmics by George Varghese.\n\nIn a misconfigured network\u2014one with bridges connecting Ethernets in a\nloop\u2014packets could circulate forever. We felt confident that we could figure\nout a way to prevent that. In a pinch, a product could ship without the safety\nfeature. And clearly a two-port device was only the starting point. Multiple-\nport devices could follow, though they would require custom components.\n\nI took our idea to three levels of management, looking for approval to build a\nprototype of the learning bridge that Mark envisioned. Before the end of the\nday, we had a green light with the understanding that a product would follow\nif the prototype was successful.\n\n## Developing the bridge\n\nMy immediate manager at DEC, Tony Lauck, challenged several engineers and\narchitects to solve the problem of packet looping in misconfigured networks.\nWithin a few days, we had several potential solutions. Radia Perlman, an\narchitect in Tony\u2019s group, provided the clear winner: the spanning tree\nprotocol.\n\nIn Perlman\u2019s approach, the bridges detect each other, select a root bridge\naccording to specified criteria, and then compute a minimum spanning tree. An\nMST is a mathematical structure that, in this case, describes how to\nefficiently connect LANs and bridges without loops. The MST was then used to\nplace any bridge whose presence would create a loop into backup mode. As a\nside benefit, it provided automated recovery in the case of a bridge failure.\n\nA disassembled LANBridge 100, which was released by Digital Equipment Corp. in\n1986. Alan Kirby\n\nMark designed the hardware and timing-sensitive low-level code, while software\nengineer Bob Shelly wrote the remaining programs. And in 1986, DEC introduced\nthe technology as the LANBridge 100, product code DEBET-AA.\n\nSoon after, DEC developed DEBET-RC, a version that supported a 3-kilometer\noptical fiber span between bridges. Manuals for some of the DEBET-RCs can be\nfound on the Bitsavers website.\n\nMark\u2019s idea didn\u2019t replace Ethernet\u2014and that was its brilliance. By allowing\nstore-and-forward switching between existing CSMA/CD coax-based Ethernets,\nbridges allowed easy upgrades of existing LANs. Since any collision would not\npropagate beyond the bridge, connecting two Ethernets with a bridge would\nimmediately double the length limit of a single Ethernet cable alone. More\nimportantly, placing computers that communicated heavily with each other on\nthe same Ethernet cable would isolate that traffic to that cable, while the\nbridge would still allow communication with computers on other Ethernet\ncables.\n\nThat reduced the traffic on both cables, increasing capacity while reducing\nthe frequency of collisions. Taken to its limit, it eventually meant giving\neach computer its own Ethernet cable, with a multiport bridge connecting them\nall.\n\nThat is what led to a gradual migration away from CSMA/CD over coax to the now\nubiquitous copper and fiber links between individual computers and a dedicated\nswitch port.\n\nThe speed of the links is no longer limited by the constraints of collision\ndetection. Over time, the change completely transformed how people think of\nEthernet.\n\nA bridge could even have ports for different LAN types if the associated\npacket headers were sufficiently similar.\n\nOur team later developed GIGAswitch, a multiport device supporting both\nEthernet and FDDI.\n\nThe existence of bridges with increasingly higher performance took the wind\nout of the sails of those developing new shared media LAN access protocols.\nFDDI later faded from the marketplace in the face of faster Ethernet versions.\n\nBridge technology was not without controversy, of course. Some engineers\ncontinue to believe that Layer 2 switching is a bad idea and that all you need\nare faster Layer 3 routers to transfer packets between LANs. At the time,\nhowever, IP had not won at the network level, and DECNet, IBM\u2019s SNA, and other\nnetwork protocols were fighting for dominance. Switching at Layer 2 would work\nwith any network protocol.\n\nMark received a U.S. patent for the device in 1986. DEC offered to license it\non a no-cost basis, allowing any company to use the technology.\n\nThat led to an IEEE standardization effort. Established networking companies\nand startups adopted and began working to improve the switching technology.\nOther enhancements\u2014including switch-specific ASICs, virtual LANs, and the\ndevelopment of faster and less expensive physical media and associated\nelectronics\u2014steadily contributed to Ethernet\u2019s longevity and popularity.\n\nThe lasting value of Ethernet lies not in CSMA/CD or its original coaxial\nmedia but in the easily understood and functional service that it provided for\nprotocol designers.\n\nThe switches in many home networks today are directly descended from the\ninnovation. And modern data centers have numerous switches with individual\nports running between 40 and 800 gigabits per second. The data center switch\nmarket alone accounts for more than US $10 billion in annual revenue.\n\nLauck, my DEC manager, once said that the value of an architecture can be\nmeasured by the number of technology generations over which it is useful. By\nthat measure, Ethernet has been enormously successful. The same can be said of\nLayer 2 switching.\n\nNo one knows what would have happened to Ethernet had Mark not invented the\nlearning bridge. Perhaps someone else would have come up with the idea. But\nit\u2019s also possible that Ethernet would have slowly withered away.\n\nTo me, Mark saved Ethernet.\n\nFrom Your Site Articles\n\n  * Meet Mr. Internet: Vint Cerf \u203a\n  * Ethernet is Still Going Strong After 50 Years \u203a\n\nethernetieee historylearning bridgetype:ti\n\nAlan Kirby\n\nAlan Kirby, an IEEE Life Member, is a mostly-retired computer scientist and\nexecutive.
