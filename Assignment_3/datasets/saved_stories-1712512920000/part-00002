My friend looked at me\n> for a moment, laughed, and then simply said: No.\n\nIn that blog post, Aaron reveals that the San Francisco International Airport\nMuseum is using ActivityPub to create automated social-media bot accounts for\nall its exhibits and, possibly, every object it hold.\n\nAnd why not! That would be close to impossible to do on a centralised service.\nBut on a decentralised service under your own control, it is relatively\nsimple. Perhaps I only want to follow the museum's canteen, or I just want to\nengage with a specific artefact. The Fediverse makes that possible.\n\nThis reminds me of the Melbourne \"treemail\" phenomenon. Every tree in the city\nhad an email address, ostensibly so residents could email maintenance issues\nfor a specific tree. Instead, people started interacting with the trees and\nsending them little love notes!\n\n> Dearest Golden Elm Tree, I finally found you! As in I see you everyday on my\n> way to uni, but I had no idea of what kind of tree you are. You are the most\n> beautiful tree in the city and I love you\n\nA few weeks ago, I read about Ben Smith inventing Tweeting trains. With a bit\nof code, every train line in the UK was suddenly represented on the web in a\nconvenient format. Well... Convenient if you were on Twitter.\n\nMuseums, trees, and trains naturally brings me on to the Internet of Things. I\nthink it is fair to say that IoT is in a bit of an odd place right now. Matter\nis a confusing mishmash of standards. Security and privacy issues dog the\nsimplest devices. Many people don't even want their toaster online!\n\nFor the majority of domestic uses, people want an Intranet of Things. There's\nlittle need to have your light-bulbs controlled when you're outside of WiFi\nrange. Similarly, it is probably a really bad idea to have your hydroelectric\ndam connected to the Internet.\n\nWhich brings me back to the Fediverse.\n\nOn the one hand, it would be nice to be able to follow\n@Yellow_Line@Transit_Authority.gov - or even @Bus_Stop_1234@bus_company.biz -\nthat would allow for hyperfocused data getting to the right people. It seems\nfeasible that every civic object could have a Fediverse account. From the\nindividual streetlights to the municipal sewerage system. Perhaps people won't\nsend love letters to overflowing drains - but a social-dashboard of your civic\nenvironment could be both practical and delightful.\n\nAnd, as for your domestic gadgets? Why not give every room, or every light-\nbulb, in your home a private Fediverse account? You could send a message like:\n\n> Hey @thermostat@My_Home.example.com, please set the temperature to 19\u00b0C.\n> Thanks!\n\nThat might be a bit much! But I like the idea of a private social network\nwhich consists of all my IoT gadgets talking to me and each other.\n\n## Share this post on...\n\n  * Mastodon\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Reddit\n  * HackerNews\n  * Lobsters\n  * Pocket\n  * WhatsApp\n  * Telegram\n\n## The AlgorithmTM suggests:\n\n  * This blog is now on the Fediverse!\n\n2023\n\n  * Internationalise The Fediverse\n\n2024\n\n  * A (tiny, incomplete, single user, write-only) ActivityPub server in PHP\n\n2024\n\n  * Rebuilding FourSquare for ActivityPub using OpenStreetMap\n\n2024\n\n### What are your reckons?
