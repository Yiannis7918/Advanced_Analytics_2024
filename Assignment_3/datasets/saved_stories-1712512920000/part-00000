For the song by the band The Tragically Hip,\nsee Fully Completely.\n\nPigeon with German miniature camera, probably during the First World War\n\nPigeon photography is an aerial photography technique invented in 1907 by the\nGerman apothecary Julius Neubronner, who also used pigeons to deliver\nmedications. A homing pigeon was fitted with an aluminium breast harness to\nwhich a lightweight time-delayed miniature camera could be attached.\nNeubronner's German patent application was initially rejected, but was granted\nin December 1908 after he produced authenticated photographs taken by his\npigeons. He publicized the technique at the 1909 Dresden International\nPhotographic Exhibition, and sold some images as postcards at the Frankfurt\nInternational Aviation Exhibition and at the 1910 and 1911 Paris Air Shows.\n\nInitially, the military potential of pigeon photography for aerial\nreconnaissance appeared interesting. Battlefield tests in World War I provided\nencouraging results, but the ancillary technology of mobile dovecotes for\nmessenger pigeons had the greatest impact. Owing to the rapid development of\naviation during the war, military interest in pigeon photography faded and\nNeubronner abandoned his experiments. The idea was briefly resurrected in the\n1930s by a Swiss clockmaker, and reportedly also by the German and French\nmilitaries. Although war pigeons were deployed extensively during World War\nII, it is unclear to what extent, if any, birds were involved in aerial\nreconnaissance. The United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) later\ndeveloped a battery-powered camera designed for espionage pigeon photography;\ndetails of its use remain classified.\n\nThe construction of sufficiently small and light cameras with a timer\nmechanism, and the training and handling of the birds to carry the necessary\nloads, presented major challenges, as did the limited control over the\npigeons' position, orientation and speed when the photographs were being\ntaken. In 2004, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) used miniature\ntelevision cameras attached to falcons and goshawks to obtain live footage,\nand today some researchers, enthusiasts and artists similarly deploy\ncrittercams with various species of animals.\n\n## Origins[edit]\n\nFour-year-old homing pigeon that made 15 ascents in a balloon^[1]\n\nThe first aerial photographs were taken in 1858 by the balloonist Nadar; in\n1860 James Wallace Black took the oldest surviving aerial photographs, also\nfrom a balloon.^[2] As photographic techniques made further progress, at the\nend of the 19th century some pioneers placed cameras in unmanned flying\nobjects. In the 1880s, Arthur Batut experimented with kite aerial photography.\nMany others followed him, and high-quality photographs of Boston taken with\nthis method by William Abner Eddy in 1896 became famous. Amedee Denisse\nequipped a rocket with a camera and a parachute in 1888, and Alfred Nobel also\nused rocket photography in 1897.^[3]^[4]\n\nHoming pigeons were used extensively in the 19th and early 20th centuries,\nboth for civil pigeon post and as war pigeons. In the Franco-Prussian War of\n1870, the famous pigeon post of Paris carried up to 50,000 microfilmed\ntelegrams per pigeon flight from Tours into the besieged capital. Altogether\n150,000 individual private telegrams and state dispatches were delivered.^[5]\nIn an 1889 experiment of the Imperial Russian Technical Society at Saint\nPetersburg, the chief of the Russian balloon corps took aerial photographs\nfrom a balloon and sent the developed collodion film negatives to the ground\nby pigeon post.^[6]\n\n## Julius Neubronner[edit]\n\nJulius Neubronner (1914)\n\nIn 1903 Julius Neubronner, an apothecary in the German town of Kronberg near\nFrankfurt, resumed a practice begun by his father half a century earlier and\nreceived prescriptions from a sanatorium in nearby Falkenstein via pigeon\npost. He delivered urgent medications up to 75 grams (2.6 oz) by the same\nmethod, and positioned some of his pigeons with his wholesaler in Frankfurt to\nprofit from faster deliveries himself. When one of his pigeons lost its\norientation in fog and mysteriously arrived, well-fed, four weeks late,\nNeubronner was inspired with the playful idea of equipping his pigeons with\nautomatic cameras to trace their paths. This thought led him to merge his two\nhobbies into a new \"double sport\" combining carrier pigeon fancying with\namateur photography. (Neubronner later learned that his pigeon had been in the\ncustody of a restaurant chef in Wiesbaden.)^[7]\n\nAfter successfully testing a Ticka watch camera on a train and whilst riding a\nsled,^[7] Neubronner began the development of a light miniature camera that\ncould be fitted to a pigeon's breast by means of a harness and an aluminum\ncuirass. Using wooden camera models which weighed 30 to 75 grams (1.1 to 2.6\noz), the pigeons were carefully trained for their load.^[8] To take an aerial\nphotograph, Neubronner carried a pigeon to a location up to about 100\nkilometres (60 mi) from its home, where it was equipped with a camera and\nreleased.^[9] The bird, keen to be relieved of its burden, would typically fly\nhome on a direct route, at a height of 50 to 100 metres (160 to 330 ft).^[10]\nA pneumatic system in the camera controlled the time delay before a photograph\nwas taken. To accommodate the burdened pigeon, the dovecote had a spacious,\nelastic landing board and a large entry hole.^[8]\n\nTop left: Aerial photographs of Schlosshotel Kronberg. Bottom left and center:\nFrankfurt. Right: Pigeons fitted with cameras.Top: Sectional view of patented\npigeon camera with two lenses. Bottom: Pneumatic system. The camera was\nactivated by inflating the chamber on the left. As the air slowly escaped\nthrough the capillary at the bottom, the piston moved back towards the left\nuntil it triggered the exposure.The patented camera with cuirass and harness\n\nAccording to Neubronner, there were a dozen different models of his camera. In\n1907 he had sufficient success to apply for a patent. Initially his invention\n\"Method of and Means for Taking Photographs of Landscapes from Above\" was\nrejected by the German patent office as impossible, but after presentation of\nauthenticated photographs the patent was granted in December 1908.^[11]^[12]\n(The rejection was based on a misconception about the carrying capacity of\ndomestic pigeons.^[9]) The technology became widely known through Neubronner's\nparticipation in the 1909 International Photographic Exhibition in\nDresden^[13] and the 1909 International Aviation Exhibition in Frankfurt.\nSpectators in Dresden could watch the arrival of the pigeons, and the aerial\nphotographs they brought back were turned into postcards.^[2]^[14]\nNeubronner's photographs won prizes in Dresden as well as at the 1910 and 1911\nParis Air Shows.^[15]\n\nA photograph of Schlosshotel Kronberg (then called Schloss Friedrichshof after\nits owner Kaiserin Friedrich) became famous due to its accidental inclusion of\nthe photographer's wing tips. In a breach of copyright it was shown in German\ncinemas as part of the weekly newsreel in 1929.^[16]\n\nIn a short book published in 1909 Neubronner described five camera models:\n\n  * The \"double camera\" described in the patent had two lenses pointing in opposite directions (forward/backward), each with a focal length of 40 mm. Operated by a single focal-plane shutter, the camera could take two simultaneous glass plate exposures at a time determined by the pneumatic system.\n  * A stereoscopic camera had similar characteristics, but both lenses pointed in the same direction.\n  * One model was capable of transporting film and taking several exposures in a row.\n  * One model had its lens fixed to a bag bellows. A scissor mechanism held the bellows in its expanded state until the photo was taken, but condensed it immediately afterwards. This allowed one exposure of size 6 cm \u00d7 9 cm on a photographic plate, at a focal length of 85 mm.\n  * In a panoramic camera, the focal-plane shutter was replaced by a rotation of 180\u00b0 of the lens itself.^[8] This model was the basis for the Doppel-Sport Panoramic Camera, which Neubronner tried to market around 1910. It captured a panoramic view on 3 cm \u00d7 8 cm film. It never went into serial production, though.^[17]\n\nIn a 1920 pamphlet, Neubronner described his last model as weighing slightly\nmore than 40 grams (1.4 oz) and being capable of taking 12 exposures.^[11] In\n2007, a researcher remarked that only little technical information is\navailable about lenses, shutters and the speed of the photographic media, but\nreported that Neubronner obtained the film for his panoramic camera from ADOX.\nFor this camera he estimated a film speed of ISO 25/15\u00b0 \u2013 40/17\u00b0 and a shutter\nspeed of 1/60 s \u2013 1/100 s. The film was cut to the format 30 mm \u00d7 60 mm and\nbent into a concave shape to prevent unnecessary distortion due to the half-\ncircle movement of the lens.^[15]\n\nIn 1920 Neubronner found that ten years of hard work and considerable expenses\nhad been rewarded only with his inclusion in encyclopedias and the\nsatisfaction that an ancillary technology, the mobile dovecote (described\nbelow), had proved its worth in the war.^[11] Neubronner's panoramic camera is\ndisplayed at the German Museum of Technology in Berlin and the Deutsches\nMuseum in Munich.^[18]^[19]\n\n## First World War[edit]\n\nNeubronner's mobile dovecote and darkroom as shown at 1909 exhibitions\n\nNeubronner's invention was at least partially motivated by the prospect of\nmilitary applications. At the time photographic aerial reconnaissance was\npossible but cumbersome, as it involved balloons, kites or rockets.^[11] The\nWright brothers' successful flight in 1903 presented new possibilities, and\nsurveillance aircraft were introduced and perfected during the First World\nWar. But pigeon-based photography, despite its practical difficulties,\npromised to deliver complementary, detailed photographs taken from a lower\nheight.^[11]\n\nThe Prussian War Ministry was interested, but some initial skepticism could\nonly be overcome through a series of successful demonstrations. The pigeons\nproved relatively indifferent to explosions, but during battle a dovecote may\nneed to be moved, and pigeons can take some time to orient to their new\nposition.^[11] The problem of making carrier pigeons accept a displaced\ndovecote with only a minimum of retraining had been tackled with some success\nby the Italian army around 1880;^[20] the French artillery captain Reynaud\nsolved it by raising the pigeons in an itinerant dovecote.^[21] There is no\nindication that Neubronner was aware of this work, but he knew there must be a\nsolution as he had heard of an itinerant fairground worker who was also a\npigeon fancier with a dovecote in his trailer. At the 1909 exhibitions in\nDresden and Frankfurt he presented a small carriage that combined a darkroom\nwith a mobile dovecote in flashy colors. In months of laborious work he\ntrained young pigeons to return to the dovecote even after it was\ndisplaced.^[11]\n\nIn 1912^[14] Neubronner completed his task (set in 1909) of photographing the\nwaterworks at Tegel using only his mobile dovecote. Almost 10 years of\nnegotiations were scheduled to end in August 1914 with a practical test at a\nmaneuver in Strasbourg, followed by the state's acquisition of the invention.\nThese plans were thwarted by the outbreak of the war. Neubronner had to\nprovide all his pigeons and equipment to the military, which tested them in\nthe battlefield with satisfactory results, but did not employ the technique\nmore widely.^[11]^[22]\n\nInstead, under the novel conditions of attrition warfare, war pigeons in their\ntraditional role as pigeon post saw a renaissance. Neubronner's mobile\ndovecote found its way to the Battle of Verdun, where it proved so\nadvantageous that similar facilities were used on a larger scale in the Battle\nof the Somme.^[11] After the war, the War Ministry responded to Neubronner's\ninquiry to the effect that the use of pigeons in aerial photography had no\nmilitary value and further experiments were not justified.^[14]\n\nThe International Spy Museum in Washington D.C. includes a replica of a pigeon\ncamera in its collection.^[23]\n\n## Second World War[edit]\n\nGerman toy soldier with camera pigeonMichel created an operating manual, but\ncould not find a production partner before the outbreak of the Second World\nWar.^[17]Drawing from Swiss patent\n\nDespite the War Ministry's position immediately after the First World War, in\n1932 it was reported that the German army was training pigeons for\nphotography, and that the German pigeon cameras were capable of 200 exposures\nper flight.^[24] In the same year, the French claimed that they had developed\nfilm cameras for pigeons as well as a method for having the birds released\nbehind enemy lines by trained dogs.^[25]\n\nAlthough war pigeons and mobile dovecotes were used extensively during the\nSecond World War, it is unclear to what extent, if any, they were employed for\naerial photography. According to a report in 1942, the Soviet army discovered\nabandoned German trucks with pigeon cameras that could take photos in five-\nminute intervals, as well as dogs trained to carry pigeons in baskets.^[26] On\nthe allied side, as late as 1943 it was reported that the American Signal\nCorps was aware of the possibility of adopting the technique.^[27]\n\nIt is certain, however, that during the Second World War pigeon photography\nwas introduced into German nurseries in toy form. From around 1935 the toy\nfigures produced under the brand Elastolin, some of which show motifs from\nbefore 1918 with updated uniforms, began to include a signal corps soldier\nwith a pigeon transport dog. The figurine represents a soldier in the act of\nreleasing a pigeon that carries an oversized pigeon camera.^[28]\n\nThanks to research conducted by the Mus\u00e9e suisse de l'appareil photographique\nat Vevey, much more is known about the pigeon cameras developed at about the\nsame time by the Swiss clockmaker Christian Adrian Michel (1912\u20131980)^[29] in\nWalde. He was assigned to the Swiss Army's carrier pigeons service in 1931,\nand in 1933 he began work on adapting Neubronner's panoramic camera to 16 mm\nfilm, and improving it with a mechanism to control the delay before the first\nexposure and to transport the film between exposures. Michel's camera,\npatented in 1937,^[30] weighed only 70 grams (2.5 oz), and may have been one\nof the first to have a timer operated by clockwork.^[31]\n\nMichel's plan to sell his camera to the Swiss Army failed, as he was unable to\nfind a manufacturer to produce it in quantity; only about 100 of his cameras\nwere constructed.^[17] After the outbreak of the Second World War Michel\npatented a shell and harness for the transport of items such as film rolls by\ncarrier pigeon.^[32] Between 2002 and 2007 three of his cameras were auctioned\nby Christie's in London.^[29]\n\nThe Mus\u00e9e suisse de l'appareil photographique at Vevey holds around 1,000\nphotographs taken for test purposes during the development of Michel's\ncamera.^[33] Most of the photos were taken with 16 mm orthopanchromatic Agfa\nfilm with a speed of ISO 8/10\u00b0. The exposed format was 10 mm \u00d7 34 mm. The\nquality was sufficient for a tenfold magnification.^[31] In the catalog of the\n2007 exhibition Des pigeons photographes? they are classified as test photos\non the ground or from a window, human perspectives from the ground or from\nelevated points, aeroplane-based aerial photographs, aerial photographs of\nrelatively high altitude that were probably taken by pigeons released from a\nplane, and only a small number of typical pigeon photographs.^[33]^[34]\n\n## After the Second World War[edit]\n\nPigeon camera in the CIA Museum\n\nIn the 1967 episode \"The Bird Who Knew Too Much\" of the television series The\nAvengers, foreign spies use pigeon photography to obtain photographs of a\nsecret British base, and a talking parrot to smuggle the information out of\nthe country. The United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) developed a\nbattery-powered pigeon camera now on display in the CIA Museum's virtual tour.\nAccording to the website, the details of the camera's use are still\nclassified.^[35] News reports suggest that the camera was used in the\n1970s,^[36] that the pigeons were released from planes, and that it was a\nfailure.^[37] In 1978 the Swiss magazine L'Illustr\u00e9 printed an aerial\nphotograph of a street in Basel, taken by a pigeon of Febo de Vries-Baumann\nequipped with a camera with a hydraulic mechanism.^[17] In 2002\u20132003 the\nperformance artist and pigeon fancier Amos Latteier experimented with pigeon\nphotography using Advanced Photo System (APS) and digital cameras and turned\nthe results into \"PowerPointillist\" lecture performances in Portland,\nOregon.^[38] In a 2008 film adaptation of Sleeping Beauty by the German\ndirector Arend Agthe, the prince invents pigeon photography and discovers\nSleeping Beauty on a photo taken by a pigeon.^[39]\n\nIn the 1980s a small number of high-quality replica Doppel-Sport cameras were\nmade by Rolf Oberl\u00e4nder.^[17] One was acquired in 1999 by the Swiss Camera\nMuseum in Vevey.^[17]\n\nModern technology allows extension of the principle to video cameras. In the\n2004 BBC program Animal Camera, Steve Leonard presented spectacular films\ntaken by miniature television cameras attached to eagles, falcons and\ngoshawks, transmitted to a nearby receiver by microwaves. The cameras have a\nweight of 28 grams (1 oz).^[40] Miniature digital audio players with built-in\nvideo cameras can also be attached to pigeons.^[41] In 2009 researchers made\nnews when a peer-reviewed article discussed the insights they gained by\nattaching cameras to albatrosses. The lipstick-sized cameras took a photo\nevery 30 seconds.^[42]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Hildebrandt, Alfred (1907), Die Luftschiffahrt nach ihrer geschichtlichen und gegenw\u00e4rtigen Entwicklung (in German), M\u00fcnchen: Oldenbourg, pp. 395\u2013397.\n  2. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b Professional Aerial Photographers Association (2007), \"History of aerial photography\", papainternational.org, archived from the original on 2011-01-11.\n  3. ^ Hildebrandt, Alfred (1907), Die Luftschiffahrt nach ihrer geschichtlichen und gegenw\u00e4rtigen Entwicklung (in German), M\u00fcnchen: Oldenbourg, pp. 384\u2013386.\n  4. ^ Mattison, David (2008), \"Aerial photography\", in Hannavy, John (ed.), Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-century Photography, Taylor & Francis, pp. 12\u201315, ISBN 978-0-415-97235-2.\n  5. ^ Dagron, Prudent Ren\u00e9 Patrice (1870), La poste par pigeons voyageurs, Paris: Lahure, p. 21.\n  6. ^ Hildebrandt, Alfred (1907), Die Luftschiffahrt nach ihrer geschichtlichen und gegenw\u00e4rtigen Entwicklung (in German), M\u00fcnchen: Oldenbourg, p. 406.\n  7. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b Neubronner, Julius (1910), \"Die Photographie mit Brieftauben\", in Wachsmuth, Richard (ed.), Denkschrift der Ersten Internationalen Luftschiffahrts-Ausstellung (Ila) zu Frankfurt a.M. 1909 (in German), Berlin: Julius Springer, pp. 77\u201396.\n  8. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c Neubronner, Julius (1908), \"Die Brieftaube als Photograph\", Die Umschau, 12 (41): 814\u2013818.\n  9. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b Gradenwitz, Alfred (1908), \"Pigeons as picture-makers\", Technical World Magazine, 10: 485\u2013487.\n  10. ^ Feldhaus, F.M.
