After a \u201cpolice cyber patrol\u201d\noperation, the police claimed to have discovered evidence that Yamakawa used a\nspecial tool to illegally modify Pok\u00e9mon Violet save data. With this tool he\ncould fulfill customer requests, doing things like changing a creature\u2019s\ncolors or making difficult-to-raise monsters easier to manage. This Pok\u00e9mon\nracketeering occurred between December 2022 and March 2023, with Yamakawa\nreportedly making 13,000 yen ($84 USD) per sale. He even sometimes offered\ndeals, selling six modified Pok\u00e9mon Violet monsters for 4,000 yen ($30 USD).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Related Content\n\nThe Pok\u00e9mon Company Finally Gives Us What We Want: Penny's Eevee Backpack\n\nPok\u00e9mon Go Fest 2023 Is A Reminder The Game Is Meant For A Big City\n\nWhat\u2019s Coming Out Beyond Pok\u00e9mon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nThe Week In Games: What\u2019s Coming Out Beyond Pok\u00e9mon: The Indigo Disk\n\nYamakawa, per Automaton\u2019s translation of the police report, confessed to the\ncrime, saying he did it to \u201cearn a living.\u201d Police say an investigation is\nunderway, with cops reportedly discovering that the tool Yamakawa used can be\ndownloaded for free. You shouldn\u2019t go looking for it if you\u2019re in Japan,\nthough, as using it violates the country\u2019s Unfair Competition Prevention Act\nof 2019, which bans the act of editing and selling protected data online or in\nperson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince Yamakawa is suspected of violating this law, he could face up to five\nyears in prison, penalty fees of over five million yen (over $32,600 USD), or\nboth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKotaku has reached out to Nintendo for comment.\n\nPok\u00e9mon Violet launched, alongside its sister title Scarlet, in November 2022.\nThe games were criticized as being unusually janky by critics and fans alike,\nbecoming some of the lowest-rated Pok\u00e9mon games in recent memory. Developer\nGame Freak is currently working on a new Pok\u00e9mon title, Legends: Z-A, that\ntakes trainers to the Kalos region, the same setting featured in 2013's\nPok\u00e9mon X and Y. Here\u2019s hoping that this Nintendo Switch exclusive will be in\nbetter shape when it drops in 2025.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n", "frontpage": false}
