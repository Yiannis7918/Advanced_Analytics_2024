Jane in a series called \u201cGuesses at Futurity,\u201d which were visual\nspeculations on life in the year 2000. Number 7 was \u201cInterplanetary\nCommunication. Gold Mining on the Moon.\u201d A partially buried and shaded glass\ntunnel ran from the foreground past two lampposts and into a complex of\nenclosed bridges and towers. Above the usual craggy peaks, there hung a half-\nEarth and an oblong satellite that bristled with antennae. While the\narchitecture is more late Victorian than twenty-first century, the reason for\nthe base\u2014mining\u2014is closer to the mark. Instead of gold, today it\u2019s the water.\n\nWe\u2019re following the water, not only as an economic but as a scientific gift.\nLunar water ice preserves a chemical genealogy dating back to the formation of\nthe solar system. Such knowledge will help guide our search for life\nelsewhere. Ancient cometary ice can further our ability to understand the\nnature of the outer solar system, and the composition of other lunar materials\nwill help refine our models of the Moon\u2019s formation and structure.\n\nThe far side of the Moon beckons as a site for radio telescopes. Shielded from\nthe noisy Earth, the far side could be an ideal place to study everything from\nthe magnetic fields of exoplanets to signatures of the early universe. Others\ndream of infrared telescopes located in dark polar craters, instruments so\nsensitive that they could detect seasons and weather on worlds around other\nstars.\n\nIf we are to live on other worlds, we must borrow from and care for this one.\n\nThe place astronauts will call home will have to protect and comfort them. The\nMoon\u2019s surface is beset by sweeping sheets of radiation, from the Sun and\nother stars, even other galaxies, near-light-speed particles that slice\nthrough unprotected viscera, cutting DNA molecules like rice paper and\nleading, eventually, to cancerous mutations. Long-term lunar dwellers also\ncould suffer from the lingering effects of extended exposure to one-sixth\ngravity.\n\nMoondust is a huge problem. Apollo astronauts were vexed by the sharp-edged\npowder, which got under their fingernails and into their noses, lungs, mouths,\nand eyes. Apollo 12\u2019s Alan Bean said residual dust in the LM cabin \u201cmade\nbreathing without the helmet difficult, and enough particles were present...\nto affect our vision.\u201d The stuff is like \u201csilty sand... [but] sharp and\nglassy,\u201d according to the Lunar Sourcebook. Coughing and itching are\nnuisances, but simulated long-term exposure, in one study\u2019s words, revealed\n\u201csignificant cell toxicity in neuronal and lung cell lines in culture, as well\nas DNA damage.\u201d Mitigating the dust is a significant challenge, but astronauts\nand their equipment could be protected with invisible electrodes that activate\nwhat researcher Carlos Calle calls an \u201cElectrodynamic Dust Shield\u201d\u2014shifting\nelectric fields that keep the dust from sticking to a surface.\n\nLocated at the south polar region, a lunar community would have access to\nnearly perpetual sunlight for power but might have to bury buildings in\nregolith for radiation and micro-meteorite protection. Companies like ICON are\nexperimenting with 3D printing of heated lunar regolith. Japanese researchers\nare considering a trial-run lunar \u201cbase\u201d populated first by robots. It might\nnot be a bad idea. Questions abound about the ease of working with lunar\ncompounds, including how to extract oxygen directly from the regolith. None of\nthis has yet been demonstrated on the Moon. It probably will be harder than we\nimagine.\n\nA more permanent settlement might take us back to our first homes: caves.\nAltamira 2.0. Although many lunar rilles are collapsed lava tubes, there are\nothers whose roofs remain. Housekeeping in a lunar lava tube removes much of\nthe risk of surface habitation: You are protected from micrometeorites,\nradiation, temperature swings, and surface dust. Some lava tubes have partly\ncollapsed roofs\u2014skylights\u2014that can function as entry points.\n\nResearchers have provisionally identified nearly a dozen lava tubes, including\none in the Marius Hills that goes on for miles and miles. There seems to be a\nsystem of connected lava tubes near the crater Mairan. These are,\nunfortunately, quite far from the lunar south pole region where precious water\nice waits. Yet some tubes could have ice in them too. No one knows for sure.\n\nWherever they are on the Moon, astronauts will find that the only elbow room\nwill be in a spacesuit. Science-fiction dreams of capacious domed crater\ncities must wait. The living space will be tight. And small groups in confined\nspaces inevitably experience poor sleep, along with stress that can lead to\nmoodiness, tempers, anxiety, mild to severe depression, even decreased\ndexterity. Which suggests that lunar denizens would benefit from something\nthat both monks and researchers have demonstrated is helpful: mindfulness.\n\nDefined as consciously focused, nonjudgmental awareness of the present,\nmindfulness can be cultivated through everything from three-minute breathing\nexercises to years of meditation. Studies on mindfulness-based practices among\nastronauts are relatively scarce, but psychologist Francesco Pagnini is\nchanging that. A researcher at Milan\u2019s Catholic University of the Sacred Heart\nand an associate researcher at Harvard University, Pagnini tells me that while\nNASA isn\u2019t formally incorporating mindfulness or meditation into astronaut\ntraining\u2014not yet, anyway\u2014there is of course consensus that promoting well-\nbeing is foundational. Some astronauts do in fact already practice\nmindfulness.\n\nThough the astronaut corps is a far cry from the test-pilot machismo of the\nearly Space Age, Pagnini explains that that space travelers are still loath to\nadmit to boredom or stress. Doing so could endanger their flight status.\nStill, he thinks that mindfulness, meditation, and relaxation exercises will\nbe part of training within a few years. It\u2019s no longer about just toughing out\na mission. \u201cNow we talk about thriving [in] space,\u201d he says.\n\nTo that end, Candice Alfano, a University of Houston psychologist, has found\nthat overwintering residents of Antarctica benefit from \u201csavoring.\u201d This can\ninclude things that dwellers in isolated communities have relied on for eons:\nsong, dance, rituals, and festivities. To sustain that in space environments,\nmission planners need to allow astronauts something they are typically\nreluctant to offer: spare time.\n\nFamously, Apollo 7 commander Wally Schirra defied Mission Control when that\nflight\u2019s schedule became impossible to manage. Skylab astronauts did the same.\nIt\u2019s better now, but there will be enormous pressure on the Artemis\nastronauts, even on longer missions, to fill every moment with tasks. Mission\nplanners need to respect the emotional need for savoring. It can also have a\npractical benefit: it could make astronauts better able to communicate their\nexperiences creatively and authentically while in the moment for those of us\non Earth.\n\nThen there\u2019s the green world. In 2015 and 2016, Scott Kelly grew the first\nflowers in space\u2014zinnias\u2014and the photographs he took of them rival those of\nthe James Webb Space Telescope for their beauty. Like other astronauts\nconducting experiments with plants, Kelly became absorbed by the sprouts, the\nleaves, the blossoms. Before astronauts dine on a few lettuce leaves grown in\nhydroponic racks, they eat up the views, smells, and textures of these\nreminders of the Earth.\n\nRecently, researchers at the University of Florida did something no one has\never done before: They grew plants in alien \u201csoil.\u201d Using actual lunar\nregolith collected during Apollo, scientists Anna-Lisa Paul and Robert Ferl\nsuccessfully raised Arabidopsis thaliana, a delicate cress with tiny green\nleaves. Although the lunar-soil cress plants did not grow as vibrantly as the\ncontrol group, the fact that they grew at all left Paul, in her words,\n\u201castonished.\u201d There, in the photos, are green leaves birthed from dark, Moony\nstuff. Someday, we\u2019ll be watering cress planted in Moon dirt with melted Moon\nwater.\n\nBy needs we take the green world with us. Not just for salads but for psyches.\nThe green world, the sunflower forest, savannahs, jungles, riverbanks\u2014this is\nwhere we came of age as intelligent primates. Green feeds our being, not just\nwith calories but with meaning. It softens the metal edges. Cover a lunar lava\ntube, seal it, pressurize it, melt some local ice: we could have gardens\nrunning riot in tunnels on the Moon, vines gripping basalt, Pickering\u2019s\nrevenge.\n\nIf the Moon proves to be a place we can live and work, some of our worst\ntendencies may reappear.\n\nCan we grow enough on the Moon to lessen or even eliminate terrestrial\nsupplies? A team of Chinese researchers survived on their own for two hundred\ndays in a sealed habitat, raising crops, recycling water and waste all while\nproducing breathable air. At the University of Arizona, the Controlled\nEnvironment Agriculture Center features the Lunar-Mars Greenhouses, corridors\nin which hydroponic sweet potatoes grow wildly\u2014much of the plant is edible, a\ngood choice for space. It\u2019s also viny and green\u2014welcome sight for nature-\nstarved humans.\n\nSuch space farms will provide calories, recycle water, and breathe out oxygen.\nResearchers are looking at how fish and algae can be raised and harvested in\nspace; both are sources of protein and provide recycling capacities. There\u2019s\neven talk of genetically engineering space food (including protein-rich\ninsects) with the radiation- and-desiccation fighting DNA of hardy microscopic\ntardigrades. Insects may be more than protein: a Korean study found that\ncaring for crickets improves mood and affect.\n\nWe need green on the gray Moon\u2014violas, prickly pear, millet\u2014because if we are\nto live on other worlds, we must borrow from and care for this one. What the\npoet Dylan Thomas called \u201cthe force that through the green fuse drives the\nflower\u201d can charge our ethics as we learn to live more carefully.\n\nIn 1961, Philadelphia\u2019s Fels Planetarium director I. M. Levitt had a \u201cMoon\nRoom\u201d constructed to show visitors how we\u2019d live there in the future. The\ncircular Moon Room\u2014made of molded plastic\u2014featured all the comforts of home:\nTV, recliner, built-in desk, an ultraviolet lamp for simulated sunlight and\nmore. Comfortable enough! Giving the astronauts as much agency as possible in\ndesigning everything from their sleeping pods to utensils will be important in\nthe Moon Rooms to come.\n\nSkylab astronauts, for example, loathed how small their mealtime utensils\nwere. (Industrial designer Raymond Loewy was a pioneer in helping NASA see\nthat creature comforts were necessary for Skylab\u2019s astronauts, our first long-\nduration space residents. Loewy convinced NASA that Skylab needed color\nschemes, muffled circulation fans, and, against engineers\u2019 wishes, windows.)\nThe International Space Station has come a long way since.\n\n\u201cIn all of the excitement surrounding the prospect of human settlement of the\nMoon,\u201d writes philosopher JS Johnson-Schwartz, \u201cit is easy to forget that it\nwill be incredibly difficult for humans to eke out an existence there... lunar\nsettlers will have to devote a considerable portion of their energies to the\nprovision and distribution of the basic necessities of life.\u201d In the long run,\nif the Moon proves to be a place we can live and work, some of our worst\ntendencies may reappear and this needs to be acknowledged and minimized.\nJohnson-Schwartz cautions,\n\nWhoever is tasked with overseeing life support production and distribution\nsystems might succumb to the temptation to use their position to extort others\nby controlling the flow of breathable air or consumable water. Privacy may be\nvirtually nonexistent...And the need to maintain a population that is both\nlarge enough to sustain the settlement but not so large it strains life\nsupport systems will place possibly unwelcome bounds on the reproductive\nautonomy of settlers.\n\nLunar humans\u2014lumans?\u2014will demand, design, and deploy community standards and\nfacilities that will make habitats into homes and homes into communities.\nJohnson-Schwartz also sees the opportunities in talking about these issues\nnow: \u201cWe should set the bar high instead of low when it comes to offering\nlunar settlers lives that are worth living.\u201d\n\nIt is a long trek from an Artemis Base Camp to \u201cthe first lunar state,\u201d but we\nhave the opportunity to map such a trek now. The ultimate lunar spin-off\ntechnology might not be low-impact mining of rare Earth elements. It might not\nbe hydrogen rocket plants for ships bound to Mars and the Asteroid Belt. It\nmight be the yet-perfected art of solving problems without creating new ones.\nIt\u2019s a task as tall as the mountains of the Moon.\n\n__________________________________\n\nFrom Still as Bright: An Illuminating History of the Moon, from Antiquity to\nTomorrow by Christopher Cokinos.
