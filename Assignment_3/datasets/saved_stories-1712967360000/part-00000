It was noted as the first enacted legislation in the United\nStates of America specifically designed to protect musicians from the\nunauthorized use of their voices through artificial intelligence technologies\nand against audio deepfakes and voice cloning.^[1]^[2]^[3]^[4] This\nlegislation distinguishes itself by adding penalties for copying a performer's\nvoice without permission, a measure that addresses the sophisticated ability\nof AI to mimic public figures, including artists.^[1]^[3]\n\n## Origin and Advocacy[edit]\n\nThe inception of the ELVIS Act has been attributed to Gebre Waddell, founder\nof Sound Credit, who initially conceptualized a framework in 2023 that later\nevolved into the legislation.^[5]^[6] Representative Justin J. Pearson\nacknowledged Waddell's pivotal role during the March 4 House Floor Session on\nthe bill.^[7] The act's development was a community-driven response,\nreflecting the collective initiative of the music industry to confront and\naddress the challenges posed by rapid technological advancements.^[1]\nTennessee Governor Bill Lee endorsed it as a Governor's Bill, and it was\nintroduced in the Tennessee Legislature as House Bill 2091 by William Lamberth\n(R-44) and Senate Bill 2096 by Jack Johnson (R-27).^[8]^[2]\n\nThe ELVIS Act is an amendment to a 1984 law that was the result of the Elvis\nPresley estate litigation for controlling how his likeness could be used after\ndeath.^[3]\n\n## Lobbying from the recording industry[edit]\n\nThe legislative journey of the ELVIS Act included a broad coalition of music\nindustry stakeholders, including:\n\n  * Recording Academy/GRAMMYs\n  * Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)\n  * American Association of Independent Music (A2IM)\n  * Artist Rights Alliance\n  * Black Music Action Coalition\n  * Music Artists Coalition\n  * Nashville Songwriters Association International (NSAI)\n  * Nashville Music Publishers\u2019 Association (NMPA)\n  * SAG-AFTRA\n  * Songwriters of North American (SONA)^[9]\n\nThese organizations, led by the Recording Academy and the RIAA, played roles\nin drafting the legislation, advocating for passage, and rallying support\namong the industry and legislators.^[9]\n\nThe act gained momentum through discussions that bridged industry concerns\nwith legislative action. This collaborative process led to a proposal that\nspecifically targets the use of AI to create unauthorized reproductions of\nartists' voices and images.^[9]\n\n## Opposition[edit]\n\nThe ELVIS Act saw industry opposition from the Motion Picture Association,\nincluding testimony in the House Banking & Consumer Affairs Subcommittee,\nincluding remarks that the law risks \u201cinterference with our member\u2019s ability\nto portray real people and events\u201d.^[10]^[11] TechNet, representing companies\nlike OpenAI, Google and Amazon expressed their opposition in the hearing to\nthe bill as drafted, asserting that the language was too broadly written and\ncould have unintended consequences.^[10] Other concerns around it being overly\nbroad arose with concern that it could apply to cover bands, these concerns\nwere addressed in the hearings with lawmakers mentioning that this was not the\nintention.^[7]^[1]^[10]\n\nThe bill passed the Tennessee House and Senate with a unanimous, bi-partisan\nvote including 93 ayes and 0 Noes in the House, and 30 ayes and 0 noes in the\nSenate.^[7]\n\n## Passage[edit]\n\nBy explicitly addressing AI impersonation, the ELVIS Act originated a legal\napproach to safeguarding personal rights, in the context of digital and\ntechnological advancements. It extends protections to an artist's voice and\nlikeness, areas vulnerable to exploitation with the proliferation of AI\ntechnologies that occurred in 2023.^[2]^[1]\n\nThe legislation received widespread support from the music industry, signaling\na significant step forward in the ongoing effort to balance innovation with\nthe protection of individual rights and creative integrity. It was reported as\nunderscoring Tennessee's commitment to its musical heritage and showed the\nstate as a leader in adapting copyright and privacy protections to the modern\ntechnological landscape.^[9]^[12]\n\nArtists including Chris Janson and Luke Bryan appeared at the signing ceremony\nhosted at Robert's Western World to support the new law and commemorate its\npassing.^[12]^[2]^[1]\n\n## Precedent and Trajectory[edit]\n\nThe ELVIS Act was reported as representing a development in the discourse\nsurrounding AI, intellectual property, and personal rights. It was hoped by\nproponents to set a precedent for future legislative efforts both within and\nbeyond Tennessee, offering a model for how states and potentially the federal\ngovernment could address similar challenges. As AI technology continues to\nevolve, the act represents a foundational framework for protecting the\nauthenticity and rights of artists, ensuring contributions remain\nprotected.^[1]^[12]^[13]\n\nThe act prohibits usage of AI to clone the voice of an artist without consent\nand can be criminally enforced as a Class A misdemeanor.^[4]\n\nThis legislation's success was hoped by its supporters to inspire similar\nactions in other states, contributing to a unified approach to copyright and\nprivacy in the digital age. Such a national response would reinforce the\nimportance of safeguarding artists' rights against unauthorized use of their\nvoices and likenesses.^[12]^[5]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c ^d ^e ^f ^g ^h Kristin Robinson (2024). \"Tennessee Adopts ELVIS Act, Protecting Artists' Voices From AI Impersonation\".
