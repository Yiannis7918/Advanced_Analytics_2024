Endnotes\n\nEarlier this week, I published a new homepage (version noir), which takes the\nform of a comic. Haha, get it, anhvn.com, the vn stands for version noir, but\nalso anh stands for a new homepage, haha hahahaha. I\u2019m hilarious.\n\nHalf of my conviction to finish this over the weekend was so I could make this\njoke. Finish it I did, and now I\u2019m going to tell you all about it, as I like\nto do.\n\npreview. read it here.\n\n## Context\n\nComics are, in my opinion, the perfect medium: they combine art and writing in\ninfinitely interesting ways. I\u2019ve had childhood dreams of becoming a\nchildren\u2019s book illustrator (didn\u2019t happen, but hopefully sometime in my\nlifetime) and a novelist (not even in the realm of reality), but these days,\ncreating comics is more of my jam.\n\nMy previous homepage featured 4-panel comics. This is the style in which I\u2019ve\ndrawn a lot of my comics lately: a cartoony drawing of me, rough lines, simple\nand repetitive artwork, a whimsical tone. While I enjoyed this, I wanted to do\nsomething different next.\n\nmy usual cartoony style\n\nI didn\u2019t initially plan on something noir-inspired. I was actually working on\na completely different concept for a new about page, and enough clicking\naround on Pinterest for inspiration led me to noir detective images, and I\nthought, huh, that\u2019s an idea.\n\nAnd thus: Version Noir.\n\nSome inspo artwork. Clockwise from top left: Mike Mignola, Valentin Demchenko,\nEduardo Risso, and Annie Wu.\n\n### Done is better than perfect\n\nI wanted to finish this over the long weekend\u2014I never finished my first and\nlast attempt at a serious homepage comic\u2014so it was important to keep moving\nforward. If something was imperfect, I accepted it as is. I prioritized the\ncomic being short and manageable over being well-paced. I didn\u2019t want to leave\ntoo much time for self-doubt to take ahold of me, as it is wont to do.\n\n(Even towards the tail end of this all, I started to second-guess myself\u2014no\none will like this! it\u2019s too fucking weird and makes no sense! the pacing is\noff and I need to redo it completely!\u2014and I went to bed feeling a bit less\nexcited about how it turned out, and the next morning I published it without\nlooking it over again. Looking back at it now, I no longer feel those doubts.)\n\n## Storyboarding\n\nI started by drafting stuff in my notebook. This was the very first thing I\ndrew:\n\nThe only panel I kept from this is the closeup of the eyes\u2014this image stayed\nin all my following sketches.\n\nAs I explored this, there were several key images/styles I wanted to use,\nbased on the noir theme:\n\n  * Heavy shadows and contrast\n  * A silhouette / shadow of a figure\n  * Dramatic smoke\n  * Glasses or eyes reflecting light out of the darkness\n\nMy storyboarding process involved drawing tiny thumbnails and writing the text\nnext to it to test out the flow.\n\nEarly storyboard. Some ideas persisted: the eyes closeup, head tilt, staggered\ncolumns. Initially, I was drinking wine.later storyboard and notes. I wanted a\nshot of myself peeking through some window blinds (another noir aesthetic\nwhich would produce some interesting lighting), but couldn't make it fit. I\nalso had a bigger emphasis on hands, but ended up scrapping that as well.when\nI moved to drawing digitally, my art got more refined.\n\n### Art style\n\nIn this comic, I am a cool noir detective in a trench coat. I don\u2019t even own a\ntrench coat, but it\u2019s about style, not realism.\n\nsome character/style sketches. I settled on a dark outfit + light trenchcoat,\nwhich would provide contrast on black backgrounds.\n\n## The artwork, annotated\n\nI love a detailed breakdown of the creative decisions that go into something,\nso I\u2019m going to try that here.\n\nThe setting: a coffee bar. A shadow in the doorway. A brooding detective\nfigure?\n\n  * It\u2019s a coffee bar because I needed to draw myself drinking coffee, because I wanted to draw smoke, because smoke is a classic part of the noir aesthetic, but I don\u2019t smoke and didn\u2019t want to draw myself smoking, so I settled on dramatic coffee steam.\n  * I really wanted to draw a dramatic silhouette somewhere. The fedora of this mystery figure (who represents you, the reader) is part of the aesthetic. I couldn\u2019t draw myself in a fedora because I wouldn\u2019t be caught dead wearing one, even as a dramatized noir detective. I\u2019m sorry. You are assigned the m\u2019lady role in my comic.\n  * I needed an establishing shot of the environment, and also a shot of the floor for the silhouette, hence the top-down angle.\n\nThe text\u2014what is this place?\u2014is meant to come from you. There\u2019s a pause\u2014the\nwhite space\u2014as I look at you before answering.\n\nI drew creepy eyes like this because, honestly, I didn\u2019t want to draw proper\neyeballs, lmao. This continues into the next couple of panels. Sometimes the\nstyle choice is due to laziness. My second justification is that it adds a\ntouch of creepiness that ties it together with the final panel. Sure, that\ntracks!\n\nHere are a couple of friendly panels to introduce my homepage :) I look\nfriendly and not creepy :) :) My coffee is making some dramatic smoke.\n\nAll of this dialogue could take place in just one panel, but I wanted the\nslower pacing, so I broke it up into three parts.\n\nfrom left to right, these link to: my blog, media diary, digital garden, and\nsketchbook. Of all the things I'm pleased with, I'm inordinately satisfied\nwith how those books turned out, haha.\n\nThe vertically staggered panels are meant to pull the flow downward.\nInitially, they were going to show my four media diary categories\u2014film/tv,\nmusic, games, and books\u2014but then I decided that was too specific, and I\nchanged it to show the four main sections of my site instead.\n\nI didn\u2019t figure out a good affordance though, so there\u2019s no indication that\nyou can interact with these panels at all\u2014a problem for future me to address.\n\nThese also used to be staggered from top left to bottom right, but after I\ndrew the artwork I realized they tied together better going from top right to\nbottom left. This results in a more confusing right to left reading flow, but\nalas, I accepted this flaw. I didn\u2019t want to redraw things.\n\nI knew I wanted a creepy, glasses-glinting-in-the-dark panel like this early\non. I liked the idea revealing myself as a malevolent character and ending on\na spooky note. No. Don\u2019t go anywhere. Stay with me.\n\nWith that said, I was unsure about how cohesive this was\u2014the creepiness veers\na bit outside of my initial noir concept. But I liked it enough to keep it\ndespite this.\n\nIt also touches on a previous failed project of mine\u2014a halloween homepage,\nwhich was meant to be creepy. I failed to finish this, but at the time, I\nwrote:\n\n> I\u2019ll come back to these ideas, and use them somewhere else, eventually.\n\nI like to think I did indeed come back to this, even just a little bit, a year\nand a half later.\n\n## Making it responsive\n\nI\u2019ve pondered the idea of responsive comics a long while back, but that musing\nwent nowhere. Version Noir is a bit responsive.\n\nTo sum up the CSS:\n\n  * I hard-coded a breakpoint for \u2018mobile\u2019\u2014I know desktop/mobile aren\u2019t hard and fast categories anymore, but that\u2019s how I built this and how I refer to them here.\n  * Panels have a fixed aspect ratio, and I used absolute positioning and percentage units to place elements within them. The aspect ratios changed between desktop/mobile.\n  * The staggered panels use a grid layout.\n\ndesktop vs mobile example. I move the text around to fit the empty space.\n\nThe principle: there\u2019s a lot of negative space in the shadowed area around the\nfigure, and the \u2018don\u2019t leave\u2019 text floats in it. To maintain this on a narrow\nviewport, I stack it above the drawing, making use of the available vertical\nspace.\n\n## Other technical details\n\n  * I drew everything in Procreate on iPad using the 6B Pencil brush listed under \u2018Sketching\u2019, and then exported it to PSD to edit in Photoshop.\n  * I used Tiempos Text instead of a typical comic font, because I wanted to maintain the serious tone of a serif font. During development I was using Garamond, but ended up switching because I thought it was too serious.\n  * I added a faint noise texture + sepia overlay in CSS, because the stark black + white was hurting me. (Though I didn\u2019t do this until the very end, so my eyes kept taking damage throughout the whole process, lmao.)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI feel quite satisfied with how this all came together. I\u2019m happy I finally\ndrew a comic with more serious and high-effort artwork. I like the noir vibes\nand the slight creepiness. In the future, I\u2019d like to draw something with more\ncomplex compositions, so I can do more complex responsiveness.\n\nhere is a deleted panel\u2014it was meant to go in the empty space below the\nstaggered panels. I scrapped it because it ended up not flowing well.\n\n## Endnotes\n\n  * Some of the inspo artwork was by Valentin Demchenko, who was in turn inspired by Piotr Jab\u0142o\u0144ski, who drew artwork for Destiny, lol. All roads lead back to Destiny.\n\n  * I think about Pablo Defendini\u2019s Standards, Semantics, & Sequential Art: Toward a Digital Comics Praxis all the time\u2014this is the thing to read if you\u2019re interested in adapting comics for the web.\n\n  * I have some stray notes about webcomics in my digital garden.\n\nanhvn.com personal website. site design: version 6\n\ncome look around\u2014\n\n  * Home\n  * Blog\n  * Media Diary\n  * Sketchbook\n  * Digital Garden\n  * Meta\n  * About\n  * RSS\n\n", "frontpage": false}
