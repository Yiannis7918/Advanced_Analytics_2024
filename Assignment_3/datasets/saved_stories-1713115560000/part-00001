Paleoclimatic data show it has\nbeen unstable in the past, leading to some of the most dramatic and abrupt\nclimate shifts known. These instabilities are due to two different types of\ntipping points, one linked to amplifying feedbacks in the large-scale salt\ntransport and the other in the convective mixing that drives the flow. These\ntipping points present a major risk of abrupt ocean circulation and climate\nshifts as we push our planet further out of the stable Holocene climate into\nuncharted waters.\n\n##### Sea surface temperatures from a simulation with the CM2.6 global climate\nmodel of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Lab in Princeton, USA.

While sailing at 25\u00b0N in the subtropical North Atlantic Ocean,\nCaptain Henry Ellis lowered a \u201cbucket sea-gauge,\u201d devised and provided to him\nby the British clergyman Reverend Stephen Hales, through the warm surface\nwaters into the deep. By means of a long rope and a system of valves, water\nfrom various depths could be brought up to the deck where its temperature was\nread from a built-in thermometer. To his surprise, Captain Ellis found that\nthe deep water was icy cold.\n\nHe reported his findings to Reverend Hales in a letter: \u201cThe cold increased\nregularly, in proportion to the depths, till it descended to 3900 feet: from\nwhence the mercury in the thermometer came up at 53 degrees (Fahrenheit); and\ntho\u2019 I afterwards sunk it to the depth of 5346 feet, that is a mile and 66\nfeet, it came up no lower.\u201d\n\nThese were the first ever recorded temperature measurements of the deep ocean.\nThey revealed what is now known to be a fundamental and striking physical\nfeature of the world ocean: deep water is always cold. The warm waters of the\ntropics and subtropics are confined to a thin layer at the surface; the heat\nof the sun does not slowly warm the depths during centuries or millennia as\nmight be expected.\n\nEllis\u2019s letter to Hales suggests he had no inkling of the far-reaching\nsignificance of his discovery. He wrote: \u201cThis experiment, which seem\u2019d at\nfirst but mere food for curiosity, became in the interim very useful to us. By\nits means we supplied our cold bath, and cooled our wines or water at\npleasure; which is vastly agreeable to us in this burning climate\u201d (Ellis,\n1751).\n\nIn fact, Ellis had struck upon the first indication of the ocean\u2019s overturning\ncirculation, the system of deep ocean currents that circulates cold waters of\npolar origin around the planet.\n\nBut it was not until several decades later, in 1797, that another Englishman,\nCount Rumford, published a correct explanation for Ellis\u2019s \u201cuseful\u201d discovery:\n\u201cIt appears to be extremely difficult, if not quite impossible, to account for\nthis degree of cold at the bottom of the sea in the torrid zone, on any other\nsupposition than that of cold currents from the poles; and the utility of\nthese currents in tempering the excessive heats of these climates is too\nevident to require any illustration\u201d (Thompson, 1797).\n\nNow, over 200 years later, we have a reasonable understanding of the complex\nsystem of deep ocean circulation and, what Rumford found so evident, the role\nit plays in climate. However, some major puzzles remain that may be of\nfundamental importance to our future.\n\n# Fifty Times the Human Energy Use\n\nIn this article, I discuss the Atlantic branch of the global overturning\ncirculation, a major player in past and quite likely future climate change. It\nis called the AMOC (short for Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation).\nIts northward flow of warm surface waters and deep cold return flow makes the\nSouth Atlantic a curiosity: it transports heat from the southern high\nlatitudes toward the equator, from cold to warm (Figure 1). All other ocean\nbasins behave \u201cnormally,\u201d by moving excess heat away from the sun-soaked\ntropics.\n\n##### FIGURE 1. This graphic shows a highly simplified schematic of the\nAtlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) against a backdrop of the\nsea surface temperature trend since 1993 from the Copernicus Climate Change\nService (https://climate.copernicus.eu/). Image credit: Ruijian Gou. > High\nres figure  \n  \n---  \n  \nIn the North Atlantic, the overturning circulation moves heat at a rate of one\npetawatt (10^15 Watt; Trenberth et al., 2019), about 50 times the energy use\nof all humankind, or 3.5 times the rate of global ocean heat uptake in recent\ndecades due to human-caused global warming (Z. Li et al., 2023). It delivers\nheat all the way up to the region south of Greenland and Iceland, and some\neven further north past Iceland into the Nordic Seas. There, it generously\ngives away its heat to the cold winds above until the water is so cold and\ndense that it sinks into the abyss, down to between 2,000 and 3,000 m depth.\nThere it \u201cflows as a great river, down the full length of the Atlantic\u201d\n(Broecker, 1987). The heat released to the atmosphere makes the North Atlantic\nregion much too warm for its latitude, particularly downwind of the ocean\n(Figure 2). It is also the main reason why the Northern Hemisphere is on\naverage ~1.4\u00b0C warmer than the Southern Hemisphere, and why the thermal\nequator, the latitude where Earth is the hottest, is located at ~10\u00b0 north of\nthe geographic equator (Feulner et al., 2013).\n\n##### FIGURE 2. \u201cThe Earth\u2019s climatic system currently works in a way\nbeneficial to northern Europe,\u201d the late Wally Broecker wrote (Broecker,\n1987). This map shows what the world would be like without the AMOC. Nearly\nthe entire Northern Hemisphere would be colder, especially Iceland,\nScandinavia, and Britain.

(2024). > High res figure  \n  \n---  \n  \nTemperature is not the only key ingredient of the AMOC\u2014the second factor is\nsalinity: the saltier the water, the denser it is. Salinity is therefore an\nimportant factor for the sinking described above. Hence, this overturning\ncirculation is also called thermohaline circulation, meaning a circulation\ndriven by temperature and salinity differences, in contrast to circulation\ndriven by wind and tidal currents. While temperature has a stabilizing\ninfluence on the AMOC, salinity has the power to destabilize it.\n\n# A Tale of Two Instabilities\n\nIn 1961, US oceanographer Henry Stommel (Stommel, 1961) recognized how the\nAtlantic waters\u2019 salinity leads to an AMOC tipping point, a phenomenon that\nmade newspaper headlines once again last year and this year. Water sinks in\nthe northern Atlantic because it is salty enough (unlike in the North Pacific;\nWarren, 1983). The water is salty because the AMOC brings salty water from the\nsubtropics, a net evaporation region, to the higher latitudes, a net\nprecipitation region. In other words, the AMOC flows because the northern\nAtlantic is salty, and it\u2019s salty because the AMOC flows. Chicken and egg, or\nin more technical terms, a self-sustaining feedback effect.\n\nThis works the other way around as well: If the northern Atlantic becomes less\nsalty because of an inflow of freshwater (rain or meltwater), the water\nbecomes less dense and the AMOC slows down. Thus, it brings less salt to the\nregion, which slows the AMOC further. This process is called the salt\ntransport feedback. Beyond a critical threshold, it becomes a self-amplifying\nvicious circle, and the AMOC grinds to a halt. That threshold is the AMOC\ntipping point (called Stommel Bifurcation in Figure 3). As Stommel wrote in\n1961: \u201cThe system is inherently fraught with possibilities for speculation\nabout climatic change.\u201d\n\nStommel\u2019s model just consisted of a high-latitude box and a subtropical box\nthat were connected by an overturning flow proportional to the density\ndifference between them. The model predicted this flow and the temperature,\nsalinity, and density in both boxes. Figure 3 shows the equilibrium AMOC\nstrength as computed by Stommel\u2019s box model, and the tipping point he found.\n\n##### FIGURE 3. (a) Stability diagram of the AMOC in Stommel\u2019s box model, as\nit depends on the amount of freshwater entering the northern Atlantic. Solid\ngreen lines show stable equilibrium states, the dashed green line an unstable\none. The blue curve shows a path leaving the equilibrium lines during rapid\nclimate change. After Rahmstorf (2002) (b) Here, the orange line traces the\nAMOC equilibria in a three-dimensional global ocean circulation model. The\nblack line is the same tracing experiment done with the box model. The upper\norange and black lines are traced from left to right starting from AMOC \u201con,\u201d\nthe lower from right to left starting from AMOC \u201coff.\u201d After Rahmstorf (1996).\n> High res figure  \n  \n---  \n  \nFor box models like Stommel\u2019s, the equilibrium curves can be computed\nanalytically\u2014the solution for the green curve is simply a parabola. To trace\nthe equilibrium states of a complex model, freshwater is added to the northern\nAtlantic at a very slowly increasing rate (e.g., rising by 0.1 Sv over 2,000\nyears; 1 Sv = 10^6 m^3 s^\u20131) to remain close to equilibrium and to see where\ninternal feedbacks start to dominate the weakening, which happens beyond the\ntipping point. A Dutch research team in Utrecht developed methods to directly\ncompute equilibrium states in three-dimensional ocean models (Dijkstra et al.,\n1995), but they don\u2019t work in complex coupled ocean-atmosphere models, so the\ntracing approach of slowly adding freshwater needs to be applied.\n\nIn the monostable regime (to the left of zero freshwater forcing in Figure 3),\nan AMOC shutdown can still be forced by a large temporary addition of\nfreshwater, but the AMOC will recover after the forcing is over. In the\nbistable regime, the system can be permanently in either of two stable states,\nwith AMOC \u201con\u201d or \u201coff,\u201d depending on initial conditions. So, AMOC flow\nterminated by a temporary forcing will not recover but will remain in the\nstable \u201coff\u201d state. Experiments with such a temporary freshwater addition show\nthat many, if not most, climate models are in the monostable regime and thus\ncomparatively far from the tipping point. This does not imply that they do not\nhave this tipping point or that they do not have a bistable regime; it just\nshows they are not in it for their present climate (probably wrongly, see\nsection \u201cCan Climate Models Be Trusted\u201d below).\n\nClimate change can drive the AMOC away from the equilibrium line, following\nsomething like the blue path in Figure 3a, because modern global warming\nproceeds too fast for the ocean to fully adjust. After crossing the dashed\nline, the AMOC will be attracted toward the \u201coff\u201d state even without further\npushing. Note that the AMOC is all the more vulnerable to more rapid forcing\n(Stocker and Schmittner, 1997). That means that the very slow equilibrium-\ntracing experiments shown in Figure 3b understate how close the AMOC tipping\npoint is in a situation of rapid climate change, as we are in today.\n\nThat this tipping point and the bistable regime are real, and not just an\nartifact of Stommel\u2019s simple model, has been confirmed in numerous models from\nthe entire model spectrum since Stommel\u2019s 1961 paper, including sophisticated\nthree-dimensional ocean circulation models, intermediate-complexity Earth\nsystem models, and fully fledged coupled climate models, for example, the\nCommunity Earth System Model (CESM) (van Westen et al., 2024). An early model\ncomparison found the bistable regime in all 11 participating models (Rahmstorf\net al., 2005), and I\u2019m not aware of any model that has been tested and did not\nhave this property. While this type of experiment cannot be performed with\nmodels explicitly simulating mesoscale eddies in the ocean, I do not expect\nthat this would make a major difference, given that the relevant salt\nadvection feedback operates on a very large scale.\n\nA second type of tipping point may also affect the AMOC. An important part of\nthe sinking process in the northern Atlantic (called \u201cdeep water formation\u201d)\nis deep vertical mixing (convection) when the water column becomes vertically\nunstable, due to denser water sitting above less dense water. The Swedish\noceanographer Pierre Welander showed in 1982 that convection, too, could be\nflipped off like a switch, again because of the destabilizing effect of\nsalinity (Welander, 1982). In high-latitude regions, the ocean typically gains\nfreshwater from rain at the surface, so once convection stops for long enough,\nfreshwater can accumulate and form a low-density surface layer. That makes it\nharder and harder to restart convection, and at some point, it is switched off\npermanently. In subsequent work, we showed how this works even if convection\nis intermittent in the presence of random weather variability (Kuhlbrodt et\nal., 2001; Rahmstorf, 2001).\n\nThere are two main convection regions within the present-day AMOC: one in the\nnorthern Atlantic subpolar gyre region (including the Labrador and Irminger\nSeas) and one further north in the Nordic Seas. In many model experiments, the\nLabrador Sea convection has been prone to shut down (Weijer et al., 2019),\nslowing not just the AMOC but also the subpolar gyre, a huge counterclockwise\nrotating flow south of Greenland and Iceland (Figure 4). Once convection\n(which normally extracts heat from the water column by mixing warmer water up\nto the surface, where heat is lost to the atmosphere) has been capped in this\nway, less heat gets lost through the sea surface, and the whole water column\ngets less dense. This slows the AMOC, which after all is driven by the cold,\nhigh-density waters pushing south from the high latitudes. Thus, a convection\nshutdown can help trigger an AMOC shutdown. And because convection is a small-\nscale process, it is not captured well in most current models (Jackson et al.,\n2023), adding a layer of uncertainty about the future.\n\n##### FIGURE 4. Present surface flows (solid lines) and deep flows (dashed\nlines) are shown for the northern Atlantic and the Nordic Seas. Figure\nmodified from R. Curry and C. Mauritzen \u00a9 Woods Hole Oceanographic\nInstitution. > High res figure  \n  \n---  \n  \n# Drastic Past AMOC Changes\n\nBased on this understanding of AMOC instability mechanisms, we can examine\nsome dramatic climate changes that have happened in the recent past\u2014\u201crecent,\u201d\nthat is, from a paleoclimate perspective, namely in the last 100,000 years.\n\nIn 1987, Wally Broecker published a now famous article in the journal Nature\ntitled \u201cUnpleasant surprises in the greenhouse?\u201d (Broecker, 1987). In it, he\ndiscusses data from deep-sea sediment cores and holes drilled into the\nGreenland ice cap, noting that these data reveal that \u201cclimate changed\nfrequently and in great leaps\u201d rather than smoothly and gradually. Given the\nregional patterns of these changes, he identified the AMOC (at the time\nreferred to as the \u201cAtlantic conveyor belt\u201d) as the culprit. He warned that by\nreleasing greenhouse gases, \u201cwe play Russian roulette with climate [and] no\none knows what lies in the active chamber of the gun.\u201d\n\nIn the decades since then, we have come to distinguish two types of abrupt\nclimate events that repeatedly occurred during the last Ice Age, centered\naround the northern Atlantic but with global repercussions (Rahmstorf, 2002).\n\nThe first type is Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events, named for Danish ice core\nresearcher Willy Dansgaard and his Swiss colleague Hans Oeschger. More than 20\nevents prominently show as abrupt warming spikes of 10\u00b0\u201315\u00b0C within a decade\nor two in Greenland ice core data (Dansgaard et al., 1982). They can be\nexplained as sudden start-ups of ocean convection in the Nordic Seas when Ice\nAge convection was mostly only occurring in the open Atlantic to the south of\nIceland (Figure 5). The warm ocean circulation configuration that reached far\nnorth was apparently not stable under Ice Age conditions: it gradually\nweakened, until after some hundreds of years, the convection and warm event\nended again. It is thus an example of a convective flip-flop as discussed\nabove, with the Nordic Seas convection turning on and off.\n\n##### FIGURE 5. The AMOC during the last Ice Age. (a) The prevalent cold\n(stadial) state. (b) The warmer (interstadial) state during Dansgaard-Oeschger\nevents, showing the modeled temperature change from Ganopolski and Rahmstorf\n(2002). The very coarse resolution of that model underestimates the warming\neffect of Dansgaard-Oeschger events. > High res figure  \n  \n---  \n  \nThe second type is Heinrich events, named for the German scientist Hartmut\nHeinrich (Heinrich, 1988). It involves huge masses of ice that episodically\nslid into the sea from the thousands of meters thick Laurentide Ice Sheet that\ncovered northern America at that time. These iceberg armadas drifted out\nacross the Atlantic, leaving behind telltale layers of ice-rafted debris on\nthe ocean floor and adding fresh meltwater to the ocean surface. This led to\neven more dramatic climate changes, linked to a complete breakdown of the\nAMOC. So much ice entered the ocean that sea levels rose by several meters\n(Hemming, 2004). Evidence that this amount of freshwater entering the northern\nAtlantic shut down the AMOC is found in the fact that Antarctica warmed while\nthe Northern Hemisphere cooled (Blunier et al., 1998), indicating that the\nAMOC\u2019s huge heat transport from the far south across the equator to the high\nnorth had essentially stopped.\n\nBoth the Dansgaard-Oeschger events and the Heinrich events, although strongest\naround the northern Atlantic, had major global climate repercussions even far\nfrom the Atlantic as they affected the tropical rainfall belts that result\nfrom the rising motion of warm air above the \u201cthermal equator.\u201d During the\nwarm Dansgaard-Oeschger events, these rainfall belts shifted north, leading to\nwarm and humid conditions in the northern tropics as far as Asia. But during\nHeinrich events, the rainfall belts shifted south, leading to catastrophic\ndrought in the Afro-Asian monsoon region (Stager, 2011). Could similar shifts\nin tropical rainfall belts be in store for us in future?\n\n# The \u201cCold Blob\u201d: An Ominous Sign of a Slowing AMOC?\n\nLet us look how the AMOC is already responding to ongoing global warming,\nwhich has already pushed Earth\u2019s climate outside the envelope of the stable\nHolocene (Osman et al., 2021) in which Homo sapiens developed agriculture and\nstarted to build cities.\n\nUnfortunately, AMOC data only go back a few decades, drawn from just a handful\nof cross-Atlantic cruises since the 1950s and the RAPID-AMOC array of stations\nthat has collected continuous measurements of salinity and current velocities\nfrom the near surface to the seafloor across the Atlantic at 26\u00b0N since 2004\n(Smeed et al., 2020). Therefore, we must turn to indirect evidence. Exhibit\nNo. 1 is the \u201cwarming hole\u201d or \u201ccold blob\u201d found on maps of observed global\ntemperature change (Figure 6). While the entire globe has warmed, the subpolar\nNorth Atlantic has resisted and even cooled. This is exactly the region where\nthe AMOC delivers much of its heat, and exactly the region where climate\nmodels have long predicted cooling as a result of the AMOC slowing down.\n\n##### FIGURE 6. Map of observed near-surface air temperature changes since the\nlate nineteenth century. Gray areas indicate lack of data. Image credit: Zeke\nHausfather, Berkeley Earth. > High res figure  \n  \n---  \n  \nA seminal study by Dima and Lohmann (2010) analyzed global patterns of sea\nsurface temperature changes since the nineteenth century and concluded \u201cthat\nthe global conveyor has been weakening since the late 1930s and that the North\nAtlantic overturning cell suffered an abrupt shift around 1970.\u201d Two years\nlater, a Dutch group, analyzing an ensemble of model results, confirmed that\nan AMOC slowdown causes the northern Atlantic cooling and dubbed the feature\nthe \u201cwarming hole\u201d (Drijfhout et al., 2012). In 2015, I joined forces with US\nclimate scientist Michael Mann and other colleagues in using Mann\u2019s\npaleoclimatic proxy reconstruction of surface temperatures to suggest that the\nmodern AMOC slowdown is probably unique in at least the last millennium\n(Rahmstorf et al., 2015). The term \u201ccold blob\u201d originated in a quote from Mann\nin a Washington Post article on our study (Mooney, 2015), and it has since\nstuck.\n\nTheoretically, the cold blob could have also arisen from an increase in net\nheat loss at the ocean surface (He et al., 2022). For short-term variability\nfrom year to year, weather conditions are expected to play a dominant role in\nchanging the sea surface temperature\u2014particularly in summer when the surface\nmixed layer is thin and its thermal inertia is small (thus, in later studies,\nwe focus on the period November\u2013May). The observations-based reanalysis data\nshow, however, that since the mid-twentieth century, net heat loss through the\nocean surface in the cold blob region has decreased, not increased\u2014exactly\nwhat would be expected when the ocean is bringing less heat into that region,\nso less is passed on to the atmosphere (Figure 7). Also, analysis of climate\nmodels, in which AMOC changes are known, shows that the AMOC strength\ncorrelates closely with the cold blob temperature change (Caesar et al.,\n2018). This result confirms that on longer timescales, the AMOC is the\ndominant factor, allowing the conclusion that the cold blob so far corresponds\nto about 15% weakening of the AMOC.\n\n##### FIGURE 7.

They result from the fact that the Coriolis force changes\nwith latitude. In 2007 and 2008, two studies conducted by AMOC researcher Rong\nZhang demonstrated how a basic law of physics, angular momentum conservation,\nacting at the point where the deep southward AMOC flow crosses under the Gulf\nStream, makes the Stream shift closer to shore when the AMOC weakens (Zhang\nand Vallis, 2007; Zhang, 2008). Her studies describe a \u201cfingerprint\u201d of a\nweakening AMOC that not only includes the cold blob but also a sea surface\ntemperature anomaly of opposite sign off the American Atlantic coast north of\nCape Hatteras.\n\nCaesar et al. (2018) compared this fingerprint to observed sea surface\ntemperature changes since the late nineteenth century and found strong\nagreement (see Figure 9). The observational data are much less detailed\nbecause they rely on relatively sparse ship measurements, but more detail is\nin the satellite data. Although the time periods for the observed and the\nsatellite data are different, the trends are divided by the global mean\ntemperature change to make them roughly comparable in magnitude. Thus, for the\nrelatively short satellite period there is much stronger random variability\nrelative to the signal (\u201cnoise\u201d), and the signal-to-noise ratio declines from\ntop to bottom in the three images. Despite the differences in other\nvariability, the fingerprint of AMOC decline is very clear in all three Figure\n9 plots.\n\n##### FIGURE 9.

This flow may be unrelated to\nthe AMOC, or possibly anti-correlated to the AMOC and thus a third part of its\nfingerprint.\n\nThe strong warming off the North American Atlantic coast is again not caused\nby surface heat fluxes, as the reanalysis data show the surface heat flux has\nchanged in the opposite direction, toward increasing heat loss (Figure 7).\nAlso, the current generation of climate models (CMIP6) indicate a clear\ncorrelation of AMOC strength with this fingerprint pattern of sea surface\ntemperatures, including both the cold blob and the warming part (Latif et al.,\n2022).\n\nFurthermore, a recent study using the three-dimensional observational ocean\ndata collected by Argo profiling floats (https://argo.ucsd.edu/) shows that\nthe Gulf Stream has shifted about 10 km closer to shore since the beginning of\nthis century (Todd and Ren, 2023). From the RAPID array we know that the AMOC\nhas indeed weakened during this time span. In addition, there has been a\n\u201crobust weakening of the Gulf Stream during the past four decades observed in\nthe Florida Straits\u201d (Piecuch and Beal, 2023), which, although not necessarily\nlinked to an AMOC weakening, is at least consistent with it.\n\nAdditional evidence consistent with AMOC slowing also comes from salinity\nchanges. The northeastern subpolar Atlantic is freshening (Figure 10), likely\nthrough a combination of increased freshwater input from rainfall and rivers\nas well as the melting of sea ice and the Greenland ice sheet, plus the effect\nof ocean circulation changes bringing less salty subtropical waters to the\nnorth. The Iceland Basin registers the lowest salinity in 120 years of\nmeasurements (Holliday et al., 2020).\n\n##### FIGURE 10.

This decline implies an AMOC weakening of\n~13% over this period (Chafik et al., 2022), consistent with the 15% weakening\nsuggested by the cold blob data.\n\n# More Lessons from Paleoclimate\n\nTo understand conditions before regular temperature measurements began, we\nmust turn to proxy data: the traces of past climate change left behind in\nslowly accumulating archives such as ice sheets or seafloor sediments. These\nproxies allow us to reconstruct past sea surface temperatures and other\nparameters. For example, the ratio of oxygen isotopes found in the microscopic\nskeletons that make up much of deep seafloor sediment provide a record of past\nsurface water temperatures, and the sizes of sediment grains on the ocean\nfloor reveal current speeds above it. Caesar et al. (2021) compiled a number\nof published reconstructions of past AMOC flow and concluded that the AMOC is\ncurrently at its weakest in the last millennium (Figure 11).\n\n##### FIGURE 11. AMOC strength for the past 1,600 years as reconstructed from\ndifferent paleoclimatic data sets. After Caesar et al. (2021) The vertical\naxis shows the temperature anomaly in the \u201ccold blob\u201d region from Caesar et\nal. (2018); other data are scaled to that. > High res figure  \n  \n---  \n  \nThough the validity of proxy data can always be questioned, there is general\nagreement in data collected from different regions analyzed by different\nresearch teams using very different methods. For those proxy data series that\nextend to recent decades, the agreement between observation- and model-based\nAMOC reconstructions is good (Caesar et al., 2022).\n\nGiven the many independent lines of evidence, there is overwhelming evidence\nfor a long-term weakening of the AMOC since the early or mid-twentieth\ncentury. Note that there is substantial decadal variability in the AMOC in\naddition to its long-term decline, which makes it essential to be clear about\nthe exact time period when discussing AMOC changes.\n\nIs the long-term AMOC weakening human-caused? Multiple lines of evidence point\nto its being a result of fossil-fuel-caused global warming. First, climate\nmodels have long predicted its decline in response to global warming, and the\nphysics behind these predictions is understood. At least two studies analyzing\nstate-of-the-art climate models and observations have shown \u201cthat the recent\nNorth Atlantic warming hole is of anthropogenic origin\u201d and is caused by\nreduced northward oceanic heat transport related to greenhouse gas emissions\n(Chemke et al., 2020; Qasmi, 2023). In addition, the paleoclimatic data shown\nin Figure 11 also strongly point to human activities as the cause, in that\nAMOC weakening coincides with the period of unprecedented modern global\nwarming.\n\n# Can Climate Models Be Trusted?\n\nClimate models have long predicted a significant AMOC slowdown in response to\nglobal warming, including a corresponding cold blob (see Figure 12 for a\nrecent version). In fact, I wrote two commentary pieces for Nature on that\ntopic in the 1990s (Rahmstorf, 1997, 1999), and then as now, the amount of\npredicted weakening differed greatly among different models. The latest, sixth\nIPCC report found that, even for a low emissions scenario, the AMOC will\nweaken between 4% and 46% by the year 2100, depending on the model. In the\nhigh emissions scenario, the reduction ranges between 17% and 55% (IPCC,\n2021). The IPCC report also concluded: \u201cWhile there is medium confidence that\nthe projected decline in the AMOC will not involve an abrupt collapse before\n2100, such a collapse might be triggered by an unexpected meltwater influx\nfrom the Greenland Ice Sheet.\u201d\n\n##### FIGURE 12. This Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) figure\nillustrates global temperature changes by the year 2100 for a low emissions\nscenario (SSP1-2.6) in high-warming models (IPCC, 2021, Figure 1 of Box TS.3).\n> High res figure  \n  \n---  \n  \nThis brings us to an important question: Can we trust climate models on this?\nGenerally, climate models have done a great job in predicting global mean\ntemperatures. Even rather simple models from the 1980s predicted global\nwarming quantitatively correctly\u2014including the models run by Exxon (Supran et\nal., 2023). But that\u2019s relatively easy, as it just depends on Earth\u2019s energy\nbalance.\n\nChanges in thermohaline ocean circulation are far more difficult to predict,\nas they depend on subtle temperature and salinity differences across the\nocean, in three dimensions. The models haven\u2019t done well at reproducing past\nAMOC changes (McCarthy and Caesar, 2023). The last IPCC report shows that\ncurrent climate models on average don\u2019t even generate the observed cold blob\n(though many earlier models did; see Figure 13).\n\n##### FIGURE 13. Comparison of observed and simulated annual mean surface\ntemperature change for 1\u00b0C global warming (IPCC, 2021, Figure SPM.5). The\nmodels on average do not reproduce the observed cold blob. > High res figure  \n  \n---  \n  \nThere is in fact a substantial body of research suggesting that the AMOC is\ngenerally too stable in climate models. One reason might be what the IPCC has\ncalled \u201ctuning towards stability.\u201d If a model has a too unstable AMOC that\nalready collapses for the present climate, as has happened in a number of\nmodels (e.g., Manabe and Stouffer, 1988), the model will be \u201crepaired\u201d (i.e.,\nimproved to better reflect reality). But if the AMOC is too stable, that model\nwill not look wrong because the present-day climate is correctly reproduced.\n\nAnother problem is even featured in the 2004 Hollywood blockbuster The Day\nAfter Tomorrow, where the scientist Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) says: \u201cNo one has\ntaken into account how much freshwater is being dumped into the ocean because\nof melting polar ice! I think we\u2019ve hit a critical desalinization point.\u201d\nUntil now, most climate models have not incorporated an interactive Greenland\nIce Sheet (which has its own tipping point; e.g., Robinson et al., 2012) and\nneglect its growing meltwater input.\n\nThis \u201ccritical desalinization point\u201d is, of course, Stommel\u2019s tipping point\ndiscussed earlier, and finding out how far we are from that point is a very\nhard problem indeed.\n\n# Where is that Tipping Point?\n\nOne way to find the tipping point is to perform an experiment like the one\nshown in Figure 3. But this is very computationally expensive, and in models\nwhere it has been tried, the distance to the tipping point differs a lot. In\n1996 I proposed that whether the AMOC transports freshwater out of or into the\nAtlantic at the latitude of South Africa determines whether it is in the\nbistable regime marked in Figure 3, or further away from the tipping point\ntoward the left (Rahmstorf, 1996). Other studies have supported this idea, and\nobservational data suggest the real AMOC is in the bistable regime, meaning\nrelatively close to the critical point. In contrast, in most models, the AMOC\nis in the monostable regime, far away from the tipping point (see the review\nby Weijer et al., 2019). The reason is apparently subtle biases in the\nAtlantic salinity distribution in the models. This salinity distribution can\nbe nudged toward more realistic, observed salinity values, rather than letting\nthe salinity evolve freely under the influence of computed rainfall,\nevaporation, and ocean currents. When this was done in a climate model, the\nAMOC collapsed in a scenario of doubling CO_2 concentration, while it remained\nstable in the original unadjusted model (Liu et al., 2017).\n\nGiven the limitations of current climate models, some researchers have turned\nto methods borrowed from nonlinear physics to look for early warning signals\nof an approaching tipping point in observational data. These are based on the\nfact that in a \u201cnoisy\u201d system like climate, such parameters as AMOC\u2019s strength\nrandomly \u201cwiggle around\u201d a bit under the influence of stochastic (random)\nvariations, such as the weather. But when the system is close to a tipping\npoint, the forces that push it back to its stable equilibrium get\nprogressively weaker\u2014so the system takes longer to swing back. This is called\n\u201ccritical slowing down.\u201d\n\nSeveral studies have analyzed AMOC data in that light. Boers (2021) analyzed\nfour temperature and four salinity data series that have been linked to AMOC\nstrength and concluded there is \u201cstrong evidence that the AMOC is indeed\napproaching a critical, bifurcation-induced transition.\u201d In another study,\nMichel et al. (2022) used 312 paleoclimatic proxy data series going back a\nmillennium and found a \u201crobust estimate, as it is based on sufficiently long\nobservations, that the Atlantic multidecadal variability may now be\napproaching a tipping point after which the Atlantic current system might\nundergo a critical transition.\u201d In 2023, Danish researchers made news\nheadlines with their \u201cwarning of a forthcoming collapse of the AMOC,\u201d starting\nany time between 2025 and 2095 and most likely around the middle of this\ncentury (Ditlevsen and Ditlevsen, 2023). A recent study by the Dutch group at\nUtrecht University\u2014one of the world\u2019s leading research groups on AMOC\nstability\u2014introduced a \u201cnew physics-based early warning signal [which] shows\nAMOC is on tipping course\u201d (van Westen et al., 2024).\n\nAll of these predictions have their limitations\u2014for example, changes in the\nvariability might conceivably have other reasons than an approaching tipping\npoint. But the fact that all these studies, using different methods, point in\nthe same direction, toward a risk that is much larger and earlier than we had\nthought until a few years ago, is a major concern. My assessment of these\nearly warning signal studies is that by the time they can provide a reasonably\nreliable warning of an impending AMOC tipping, it will be too late to prevent\nit. In this situation, the only responsible policy reaction is to be guided by\nthe precautionary principle (i.e., the responsibility to protect the public\nfrom harm when scientific investigation has found a plausible risk).\n\nTo some extent, tipping may even depend on the vagaries of weather. In NASA\u2019s\nclimate model, in 10 simulations using the same \u201cmiddle-of-the-road\u201d\ngreenhouse warming scenario (SSP2\u20134.5) with under 3\u00b0C global warming, the AMOC\ncollapses in two but recovers after significant weakening in eight; the\ndifference is merely stochastic internal variability (Romanou et al., 2023).\nThis is also part of the nature of tipping points.\n\nApart from a full shutdown of the AMOC, there is still the second type of\ntipping point to consider, the one where convection shuts down in one region.\nThat happens in a surprising number of climate models, and so far hasn\u2019t\ngotten the public attention it deserves. The first documented case, the\nBritish Hadley Centre model, was published in 1999 (Wood et al., 1999). Of the\nlatest model generation (CMIP6), in four out of the 35 models, subpolar gyre\nconvection breaks down\u2014and all four are in the group of the 11 best models in\nterms of reproducing the vertical density profiles in the subpolar gyre\n(Swingedouw et al., 2021). That\u2019s in 36% of those high-quality models. In the\nprevious model generation (CMIP5), that number was 45%. What\u2019s more, it\ntypically happens as soon as the year 2040 and for moderate emission\nscenarios\u2014even without properly accounting for Greenland melt. Thus, a\ncollapse of convection in the subpolar gyre, resulting in rapid AMOC weakening\nand abrupt regional cooling, must be considered a high risk urgently requiring\nattention.\n\nWhat does this mean for our future? Let\u2019s first look at the impacts of an AMOC\nslowdown or collapse, and then discuss the implications.\n\n# How Bad Would It Be?\n\nThe current cold blob is already affecting our weather, though not in the way\nthat might be expected: a cold subpolar North Atlantic correlates with summer\nheat in Europe (Duchez et al., 2016). The cooling of the sea surface is enough\nto influence the air pressure distribution in a way that encourages an influx\nof warm air from the south into Europe. For example, in summer 2015, the\nsubpolar Atlantic was the coldest since records began in the nineteenth\ncentury\u2014while Europe suffered a strong heatwave. Subsequent study has shown\nthat heatwaves are increasing three to four times faster in Europe than in\nother regions of the Northern Hemisphere, related to changes in the jet stream\nthat may well be influenced by the cold blob (Rousi et al., 2022).\n\nSeveral studies show that if the AMOC weakens, sea levels on the American\nnortheast coastline will rise more sharply (e.g., Levermann et al., 2005; Yin\net al., 2010). The Coriolis force pushes moving water, in this case, in the\nGulf Stream, to the right, away from the American coast. When the Gulf Stream\nweakens, less water is moved northward, causing water levels to rise inshore\nof the Gulf Stream, with models projecting a 15\u201320 cm rise by 2100 from this\neffect alone, in addition to other causes of rising seas. Coastal erosion, the\nfrequency of nuisance flooding, and extent of storm surge damage will\nsubstantially increase.\n\nA collapse of convection in the subpolar gyre would significantly magnify\nthese problems. Figure 14 shows the expected temperature change in this case.\nIt is not so much the absolute change, but the changes in temperature contrast\nbetween neighboring regions\u2014here, the cold ocean relative to the adjacent warm\nland masses\u2014that will greatly change the dynamics of the weather, as\ntemperature gradients drive weather activity in ways we can\u2019t foresee in\ndetail. Even this limited oceanic change will shift tropical rainfall belts,\nthough not by as much as a full AMOC shutdown.\n\n##### FIGURE 14. Temperature changes in the model-mean before and after a\ncollapse of convection in the subpolar gyre region are plotted here. From\nSwingedouw et al. (2021). > High res figure  \n  \n---  \n  \nA full shutdown of the AMOC would have truly devastating consequences for\nhumanity and many marine and land ecosystems. Figure 15 shows the model of Liu\net al. (2017) after a doubling of CO_2, with an AMOC collapse caused by this\nCO_2 increase. The cold air temperatures then expand to cover Iceland,\nBritain, and Scandinavia. The temperature contrast between northern and\nsouthern Europe increases by a massive 4\u00b0C, likely with major impact on\nweather, such as unprecedented storms.\n\n##### FIGURE 15. Annual-mean near-surface air temperature change resulting\nfrom a CO_2 doubling and AMOC breakdown. While Earth is much warmer, the\nnorthern Atlantic region has become colder. In winter, the cooling there is\nmuch larger still. From Liu et al. (2017). > High res figure  \n  \n---  \n  \nFigure 16 shows the precipitation changes in this model. As we have seen in\nthe paleoclimate data for Heinrich events, major precipitation shifts in the\ntropics would likely cause drought problems in the northern tropics of America\nas well as Asia. Seasonal changes will be even larger than these annual mean\nchanges. Other simulations predict a significant increase in winter storms in\nEurope and a \u201cstrong reduction of crop yield and pasture\u201d there (Jackson et\nal., 2015).\n\n##### FIGURE 16. Annual-mean precipitation change resulting from a CO_2\ndoubling and AMOC breakdown. Most concerning is the southward shift in\ntropical rainfall belts and a generally drier Europe. From Liu et al. (2017).\n> High res figure  \n  \n---  \n  \nThe IPCC summarized the impacts: \u201cIf an AMOC collapse were to occur, it would\nvery likely cause abrupt shifts in the regional weather patterns and water\ncycle, such as a southward shift in the tropical rain belt, and could result\nin weakening of the African and Asian monsoons, strengthening of Southern\nHemisphere monsoons, and drying in Europe\u201d (IPCC, 2021, TS p. 73). Some\nfurther consequences include major additional sea level rise especially along\nthe American Atlantic coast, reduced ocean carbon dioxide uptake, greatly\nreduced oxygen supply to the deep ocean, and likely ecosystem collapse in the\nnorthern Atlantic.\n\n# Implications: Uncertainty Is Not Our Friend\n\nThe risk of a critical AMOC transition is real and very serious, even if we\ncannot confidently predict when and whether this will happen. We have already\nleft behind the stable Holocene climate in which humanity has thrived (Osman\net al., 2021), and the latest IPCC report warns us that beyond 1.5\u00b0C of global\nwarming, we move into the realm of \u201chigh risk\u201d with respect to climate tipping\npoints (IPCC, 2023).\n\nAlso at risk is the Southern Hemisphere equivalent of the northern Atlantic\ndeep-water formation: the Antarctic bottom-water formation. A recent study by\nAustralian researchers concluded that the increasing meltwater inflow around\nAntarctica is set to dramatically slow down the Antarctic overturning\ncirculation, with a potential collapse this century (Q. Li et al., 2023). That\nwill slow the rate at which the ocean takes up CO_2 (hence, more will\naccumulate in the atmosphere), and it will reduce the oxygen supply for the\ndeep sea.\n\nA full AMOC collapse would be a massive, planetary-scale disaster. We really\nwant to prevent this from happening.\n\nIn other words: we are talking about risk analysis and disaster prevention.\nThis is not about being 100% or even just 50% sure that the AMOC will pass its\ntipping point this century; the issue is that we\u2019d like to be 100% sure that\nit won\u2019t. That the IPCC only has \u201cmedium confidence\u201d that it will not happen\nthis century is anything but reassuring, and the studies discussed here, which\ncame after the 2021 IPCC report, point to a much larger risk than previously\nthought.\n\nThe Global Tipping Points Report 2023 was published in December 2023, a\n500-page effort by 200 researchers from 90 organizations in 26 countries\n(Lenton et al., 2023). Its summary conclusion reads: \u201cHarmful tipping points\nin the natural world pose some of the gravest threats faced by humanity. Their\ntriggering will severely damage our planet\u2019s life-support systems and threaten\nthe stability of our societies.\u201d\n\nFor the AMOC and other climate tipping points, the only action we can take to\nminimize the risk is to phase out fossil fuel use and stop deforestation as\nfast as possible. If we can reach zero emissions, further global warming will\nstop within years, and the sooner this happens the smaller the risk of passing\ndevastating tipping points. It would also minimize many other losses, damages,\nand human suffering from \u201cregular\u201d global warming impacts (e.g., heatwaves,\nfloods, droughts, harvest failures, wildfires, sea level rise), which are\nalready happening all around us even without the passing of major climate\ntipping points.\n\nAs another Climate Tipping Points report published in December 2022 by the\nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) concludes: \u201cYet,\nthe current scientific evidence unequivocally supports unprecedented, urgent\nand ambitious climate action to tackle the risks of climate system tipping\npoints\u201d (OECD, 2022).\n\nIt would be irresponsible, even foolhardy, if policymakers, business leaders,\nand indeed the voting public continue to ignore those risks.\n\n##### Citation\n\nRahmstorf, S. 2024.
