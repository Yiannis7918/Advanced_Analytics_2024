This defining trait of the condition has informed prevailing\ntheories of its roots as well as the design of many autism treatments.\n\nBut an emerging line of work supports a more nuanced look at the social\nabilities of autistic people. Proponents of an idea called the \u2018double empathy\nproblem\u2019 believe that communication breakdowns between autistic and non-\nautistic people are a two-way issue, caused by both parties\u2019 difficulties in\nunderstanding. This \u2018double problem\u2019 challenges long-held theories of autism\nthat point to social shortcomings of people with autism as the reason\ninteractions flop. It also echoes principles of neurodiversity in its\nassumption that autistic people simply have a different way of communicating\nrather than a deficient one. \u201cAs a theory, it matches autistic phenomenology\ncoming from insider accounts,\u201d says autistic researcher Damian Milton,\nlecturer in developmental and intellectual disabilities at the University of\nKent in the United Kingdom.\n\nAlthough scientific support for the theory is building, it is not yet rock\nsolid. And not all researchers are tuned in to this new direction, says\nMatthew Lerner, associate professor of psychology, psychiatry and pediatrics\nat Stony Brook University in New York. \u201cThe double empathy problem is a\nyounger theory empirically,\u201d he says.\n\nWhat is the double empathy problem?\n\nThe basis of the theory is that a mismatch between two people can lead to\nfaulty communication. This disconnect can occur at many levels, from\nconversation styles to how people see the world. The greater the disconnect,\nthe more difficulty the two people will have interacting.\n\nIn the case of autism, a communication gap between people with and without the\ncondition may occur not only because autistic people have trouble\nunderstanding non-autistic people but also because non-autistic people have\ntrouble understanding them. The problem, the theory posits, is mutual. For\nexample, difficulty in reading the other person\u2019s facial expressions may stunt\nconversations between autistic and non-autistic people.\n\nWhat are the origins of the theory?\n\nThis conception of social issues in autism as a two-way street is decades old.\nAutistic activists such as Jim Sinclair have argued since the 1990s that\nautistic modes of communication conflict with neurotypical ones.\n\nMilton first coined the term \u2018double empathy problem\u2019 in a 2012 paper. For\nhim, the idea offered a way to reframe the long-held notion that individuals\non the spectrum have impaired theory of mind \u2014 the ability to infer the\nintentions or feelings of others \u2014 to include potential misunderstanding by\nnon-autistic people.\n\nWhat evidence supports it?\n\nInstead of focusing on how people with autism perform in social situations,\nnew studies probe how non-autistic people perform when interacting with\nautistic people. The results hint that non-autistic people\u2019s blind spots\ncontribute to the communication gap. For example, in one study, non-autistic\npeople had trouble deciphering the mental states autistic people portrayed\nthrough animations. Other work shows that non-autistic individuals struggle to\naccurately interpret autistic people\u2019s facial expressions.\n\nNon-autistic people may also make snap judgements of autistic people that\nprevent, curtail or sour interactions between the two. For example, non-\nautistic people may be prone to having negative first impressions of autistic\npeople without knowing their diagnosis \u2014 rating them less approachable and\nmore awkward than neurotypical people \u2014 or to misjudging them as deceptive.\n\nBut aren\u2019t social difficulties a core trait of autism?\n\nYes, plenty of evidence shows that people with autism differ from those\nwithout the condition across several social domains, such as facial\nexpressions, speech patterns and eye gaze (though the last notion may be\nshaky).\n\nBut a number of studies also show that autistic people\u2019s social and\ncommunication issues are not evident when they interact with other people with\nautism. For example, in the game of \u201ctelephone,\u201d in which a message is relayed\nin whispers from one person to the next, chains of eight autistic people\nmaintain the fidelity of the message just as well as sets of eight non-\nautistic people do. It\u2019s only in mixed groups of autistic and non-autistic\npeople that the message quickly degrades.\n\nThere are other signs that people on the spectrum connect well with one\nanother. Autistic people report feeling more comfortable with other autistic\npeople than with non-autistic people. Many adolescents with autism prefer to\ninteract with autistic peers over non-autistic ones. And people with autism\noften build a greater sense of rapport and share more about themselves when\nconversing with others on the spectrum. One reason for this pattern may be\nthat autistic people are less concerned with typical social norms, such as\nconversational reciprocity, and so don\u2019t mind as much when these rules are not\nfollowed.\n\nThe principle of social compatibility may extend beyond autism diagnoses to\nautism traits. For example, the more similar two non-autistic people rate\nthemselves on an autism trait assessment, the closer they rate their\nfriendship.\n\nSo how does this theory mesh with current thinking about autism?\n\nThe double empathy problem stands at odds with several widely adopted ideas\nabout autistic people, namely that their social difficulties are inherent,\nMilton says. For example, one of the main diagnostic criteria for autism, as\noutlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, is\n\u201cpersistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across\nmultiple contexts.\u201d Similarly, the social motivation theory of autism holds\nthat people with autism have a diminished drive for social interaction.\n\nBut the new theory isn\u2019t necessarily incompatible with these ideas, says Simon\nBaron-Cohen, professor of developmental psychopathology at the University of\nCambridge in the U.K. Instead, the theory highlights the importance of\nexamining both sides of social interactions instead of focusing solely on the\nways autistic people diverge from the norm.\n\nAre autism researchers changing their approach in light of the double empathy\nproblem?\n\nSome are. For instance, scientists are rethinking how they examine social\nskills, calling for a revamp of autism studies to gauge the strengths, rather\nthan the limits, of autistic communication. Researchers are also finding ways\nto probe the dynamics of social interactions instead of studying the isolated\nbehavior of people lying in a brain scanner or sitting at a computer, says\nNoah Sasson, associate professor of behavioral and brain sciences at the\nUniversity of Texas at Dallas. \u201cI had grown a bit jaded iterating on the same\nface-processing and eye-tracking studies I had been doing that really didn\u2019t\ntell us too much new,\u201d he says.\n\nIn addition, researchers who study predictive coding \u2014 the way people form\ninternal models of the external world \u2014 are exploring how a mismatch in\npeople\u2019s predictions could hinder their interactions. For example, if an\nautistic person\u2019s expectations about how a conversation might unfold diverge\nfrom a non-autistic person\u2019s, their interaction may falter.\n\nStill, not everyone is convinced, or even aware, of the theory, Lerner says.\nSome questions at the core of the theory remain unanswered, he says. For\nexample, researchers are still figuring out why communication is smoother when\npeople with autism interact with one another than it is when they engage with\nnon-autistic people. And much of the existing evidence for the theory rests on\nanecdotal reports and small studies.\n\nIf the theory pans out, what are its implications?\n\nIn addition to suggesting new research angles, the double empathy problem may\nhelp explain why some autism assessments and treatments fall short, Sasson\nsays. For example, standard measures of social abilities don\u2019t seem to predict\nhow autistic people fare in actual social interactions.\n\nAnd therapies designed to teach autistic people normative social skills are\nnot all that effective in helping them navigate real-life situations, such as\nforging friendships, studies suggest. \u201cThe emphasis is purely on the autistic\nperson to change, a lot of the time,\u201d Milton says. Evaluating the social\nsituations surrounding autistic people and finding ways to facilitate their\nunique communication styles may be a more useful approach, he says.\n\nSimilarly, the double empathy problem underscores the importance of training\nprograms \u2014 say, for doctors or law enforcement professionals \u2014 that help non-\nautistic people interact appropriately with autistic people.\n\nThe theory also hints at possible causes of mental health problems in autistic\npeople, a team of researchers suggested in a paper published in January. Being\nroutinely misperceived can lead to loneliness and feelings of isolation. And\nattempts to conform to social norms by suppressing who you are can be\nexhausting, many experts say.\n\nCite this article: https://doi.org/10.53053/MMNL2849\n\nTAGS: audio research news, autism, behavioral interventions, diagnosis,\nempathy, eye contact, language, social difficulties, theory of mind,\ntreatments\n\n## Related Articles:\n\nFeatures / Deep Dive\n\n### The promise of scientific partnerships with people on the spectrum\n\nby Laura Dattaro / 14 January 2021\n\nFeatures / Deep Dive\n\n### How people with autism forge friendships\n\nby Lydia Denworth / 1 April 2020\n\nNews\n\n### Social communication in autism, explained\n\nby Lydia Denworth / 19 April 2018\n\nOpinion / Viewpoint\n\n### Imaging of social brain enters real world\n\nby James McPartland, Joy Hirsch / 31 January 2017\n\n2 Comments\n\nRead the Commenting Guidelines\n\nBy joining the discussion, you agree to our privacy policy.\n\nShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInSend via EmailPrintDownload\nPDF\n\n  * News\n\n    * Toolbox\n    * Spotted\n    * Profiles\n  * Opinion\n\n    * Viewpoint\n    * Q&A\n    * Cross Talk\n    * Reviews\n  * Features\n\n    * Deep Dive\n    * Special Reports\n    * Webinars\n    * Wiki\n    * Prevalence Map\n    * Spectrum Books\n  * About\n  * Editorial Policies\n  * Contact\n  * Newsletter\n  * RSS\n\nWebby Honoree for Best Writing (Editorial) & Science Website\n\nTerms & Conditions\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\u00a9 2024 Simons Foundation\n\nWe care about your data, and we'd like to use cookies to give you a smooth\nbrowsing experience.
