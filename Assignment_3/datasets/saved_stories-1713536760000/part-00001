Photo-Illustration: Curbed; Photos: Adriane\nQuinlan, Bre Johnson/BFA.com/Shutterstock, SSSPECIAL PROJECTS\n\nMost people find new office space on a tour with a commercial broker or by\ntrawling websites featuring photos and floor plans. Not the tenants at 161\nWater Street. They were recruited. The editor of Office Magazine met the\nmanagement team at a dinner in Paris. Devin B. Johnson, a figurative painter,\nwas tapped by an art curator. Many more learned about the building while\nvacationing in the Cayman Islands \u2014 specifically, while vacationing at Palm\nHeights, a beachfront hotel run by the British couple Matthew and Gabriella\nKhalil. \u201cI would have never ever, never ever thought that I would end up\nhere,\u201d said Michael Goldberg, who leads the marketing firm Something Special\nStudios and recently moved in his staff from the Lower East Side after\nconnecting with the Khalils at Palm Heights. \u201cFidi wasn\u2019t exactly an area I\nwas targeting.\u201d\n\n161 Water Street, a 700,000-square-foot, 31-story tower being rebranded as\nWSA, for Water Street Associates, is in one of the least alluring parts of the\nFinancial District \u2014 a wide, windblown stretch where its corporate neighbors\ninclude S&P Global and EmblemHealth. Even here, the building is particularly\ncorporate, a 1982 temple of reddish marble and curving tinted glass. Then\nthere\u2019s the building\u2019s past. It\u2019s better known by its former address, 175\nWater Street, which it went by as the headquarters of AIG, the insurer that\nbacked subprime mortgages, got bailout money, and then handed out bonuses to\nits executives.\n\nBuilt for a bank in 1982, the building later became the headquarters of AIG.\nPhoto: Richard Levine/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nBut inside, the space has been transformed into something entirely different \u2014\na place where artists schmooze with editors and curators, then stop for\nelevator selfies. This kind of cultivated scene hidden behind a banal exterior\nhas become the trademark of the Khalils, who run the space and have been\nexpanding their footprint across the city lately \u2014 with Happier, an Erewhon-\nish grocery store on Canal Street, and 154 Scott Avenue, an industrial\nwarehouse that holds the popular-on-TikTok restaurant Habibi and has hosted\nfashion shows that drew Beyonc\u00e9. Before opening this spring, 161 began hosting\nevents, kicking off with Emily Ratajkowski\u2019s apr\u00e8s-Met party thrown by KMJR\nlast May. (The event planner became tenant No. 1 in a set of downstairs\noffices.)\n\nWhat\u2019s drawing small boutique businesses to rent here isn\u2019t just the clout \u2014\nit\u2019s a total reimagining of the modern office, a plan for layouts, event\nspaces, and amenities that has also convinced the city to hand the building a\ntax break. \u201cThis is not a \u2018Let me gussy up the lobby,\u2019\u201d kind of project, said\nMelissa Rom\u00e1n Burch, the COO of the New York Economic Development Corporation.\n\u201cThis is a transformative renovation.\u201d The hope is that the tax break will\nallow the developers to draw what they\u2019re calling FACT tenants (fashion, arts,\ncreative, and technology) to a building whose giant floor plates were designed\nto lure FIRE tenants (finance, insurance, real estate, and legal).\n\nThe lobby (left) turned into a catwalk for the 2023 Global Creativity Awards,\nhosted by GQ, and an upper story turned into a dance floor.

Photo: Bre Johnson/BFA.com/Shutterstock\n\nOn a tour with the building\u2019s chief of special projects, Sam Wessner (who also\noversees Palm Heights), I saw a handful of the floors that have been\nrefurbished or are about to be completed, with workers scurrying in and out\nfrom behind plastic sheeting. The interiors were overseen by Gabriella Khalil,\nwho holds the title of creative director. She played into the building\u2019s 1980s\nbones, giving the place a villainous American Psycho vibe that\u2019s undercut with\na dose of humor. Instead of stuffing plants into odd corners, Khalil grouped\nmore than a hundred in reflective chrome planters that stretch around the\nlobby\u2019s curving glass window to create a cross between a lush jungle and a\nYayoi Kusama mirror room. Just below them, commanding the lobby, is a hokey\nfull-size bed in a frame designed by Frank Oelke that looks like two human\nfeet with bulbous upturned toes. In a commissary at the top of an escalator,\nan original cabinet by Memphis Group founder Ettore Sottsass holds branded WSA\nmerch.\n\nRecently, several artists have moved into a row of studio spaces on the\nseventh floor, all furnished with industrial sinks. They include Eric N. Mack,\na textile artist who has shown with Hauser & Wirth; Jeffrey Meris, who came\nfrom a residency at the Studio Museum in Harlem; and Johnson, a painter of\nmoody work who moved from a warehouse in Flushing that he found \u201cvery\nsolitary.\u201d Johnson said he has met the other artists while working out of the\nspace; upstairs are tenants who could help these artists get attention.\n(Reported neighbors include: V Magazine, Cultured, Office Magazine, and\nElephant, which threw a party in the offices last year that drew the designer\nTelfar Clemens and the artist Mickalene Thomas.)\n\nGabriella Khalil at a party in the building for Elephant magazine. Photo: Bre\nJohnson/BFA.com/Shutterstock\n\nOnly a few months in, getting an office here requires joining a wait list, and\nthe tenants who are already here seem to have known the Khalils for years.\nRaul Lopez, the designer behind the label Luar, was stuck at Palm Heights for\nmonths during a COVID lockdown; he has an office upstairs. The team behind\nGhetto Gastro, a Bronx-based food collective, was there for the lockdown too\nand now runs the lobby commissary. Tillies, the Palm Heights hotel restaurant,\nruns a catering service for 161\u2019s events, including a Free Arts NYC gala.\nEveryone in the know may be getting a deal. Tenants I spoke to said they are\npaying market rate, but in their application filed with the city, the\ndevelopers described how \u201cattractive starting rents as low as $12/SF would be\naligned with creative tenant budgets and offered to the right small\nbusinesses. As tenant budgets grow, rents will grow,\u201d an approach they\ndescribe in that application as \u201clandlord as incubator.\u201d \u201cIf you actually\nunderstand culture and the relationships they have and how the people who go\nto the resort are all aligned,\u201d said Kevin McIntosh Jr., the planner who threw\nRatajkowski\u2019s Met Ball after-party, \u201cit all kind of makes sense.\u201d In the\nlobby, he has run into fashion photographers and Vogue editors \u2014 the kind of\npeople who book him. This week, he recognized the GQ editor Miles Pope. Last\nweek, the building\u2019s Instagram featured pictures of Erykah Badu at an event\nand an elevator selfie by Stephanie Ketty, the vice-president of business\ndevelopment for BFA. \u201cThere\u2019s always someone in the building,\u201d McIntosh said.\n\nA gala for Free Arts NYC raised almost $1 million. \u201cPeople were excited to\nlearn the event was at WSA because it\u2019s such a buzzy spot,\u201d said planner Gea\nCohen-Paci. Photo: Free Arts NYC\n\nDespite the project\u2019s massive scale, everything that\u2019s in development, and the\nKhalils\u2019 involvement, it\u2019s not clear if the couple actually owns the building.\nOr who does own it. Or who owns Palm Heights, 154 Scott, or that grocery\nstore, for that matter. Nor is it clear how the Khalils came to run any of\nthese spaces in the first place. But the people who are drawn inside don\u2019t\nseem to care, even as the Khalils seem to be rapidly developing across New\nYork. In a rare interview with Bustle last month, Gabriella Khalil gave a\nglimpse into how she might have gotten into real estate: She was a Sotheby\u2019s\nInstitute grad who was working in art galleries in London when she met her\nhusband. He asked her to help stage homes to assist with his business, and\nthey shifted to working on a hotel because of an \u201copportunity that came up,\u201d\nshe said.\n\nThat opportunity seems to have come from Ken Dart, a reclusive billionaire who\nprofited off the Greek financial crisis and has more recently been making\ncontrarian investments in big tobacco. On its website, Dart\u2019s company, Dart\nEnterprises, describes how it helped flip the Hyatt that would eventually\nbecome Palm Heights. Local news reports claim Dart still owns it, but the PR\nfirm representing the Khalils says they do. (Dart did not return a request for\ncomment.) According to The Real Deal, Dart was also in talks to buy 175 Water\nStreet before reportedly withdrawing over the negative publicity. Instead, the\nbuilding sold to an LLC. (The PR rep for the building said Dart isn\u2019t\ninvolved.) In documents filed with the city, Matthew Khalil, lead of the\nproperty-development company Khalil & Kane, is listed as one of two\nprincipals. The other is Dawson Stellberger of developer Bushwack Capital, who\nis also partnering with the Khalils at 154 Scott Avenue.\n\nAs floors were gutted, WSA opened spaces for events that would bring people\nin.

From top: Photo: Daniel LevinPhoto: Something\nSpecial Studios\n\nWhoever does officially own it, the space will continue to grow over the next\nyear. A cafeteria, photo studio, recording studio, screening room, test\nkitchen, a place to film in XR, and a lounge with a bar are all slated to\nopen. There are already conference rooms for client meetings and event spaces\nto host readings or galas. The tax-break application outlines future plans to\nturn the third and fourth floors into a kind of Dover Street Market where\nbrands with offices upstairs can sell what they make or source \u2014 like the\nvintage finds of Marcus Allen, the archivist of \u201990s and aughts streetwear who\nruns the Society Archive and has reportedly moved onto the 19th floor. Above\nthat future department store are two floors of museum-class exhibition space\noverlooking the river. In some spots, ceilings have been ripped out to create\ndouble-height rooms worthy of monumental sculptures. The tax-break application\noutlines plans to open the amenities to outsiders who won\u2019t necessarily rent\noffice space but may want in on the perks: a planned gym and a spa with two\nindoor-outdoor pools will be accessible to \u201cindividuals who purchase\nmemberships.\u201d\n\nFor now, at least, the Khalils have created something that doesn\u2019t really\nexist anywhere else in the city: an office so effortlessly cool it\u2019s turning\nprospective tenants away. \u201cTo me, what really creates a place is the people,\u201d\nsaid Simon Rasmussen, the editor-in-chief of Office Magazine. \u201cYou can fill a\nspace up with gold and diamonds, but if it\u2019s not the right people, it won\u2019t\nhave the right vibe.\u201d\n\n### Related\n\n  * The Office Is Half-Dead\n\n  * The Mogul Behind the \u2018It\u2019 Destination of the Cayman Islands\n\n  * You may not know it, but you\u2019ve probably been to a Gabriella Khalil property.\n\n### Tags:\n\n  * office\n  * return to office\n  * financial district\n  * fashion\n  * art world\n  * media\n  * openings\n  * gabriella khalil\n  * palm heights\n  * influencers\n  * wsa\n  * tillies\n  * happier people management\n  * ken dart\n  * More\n\nShow 0 Comments / 0 New Leave a Comment\n\nA Fidi Office Building With a Wait List\n\nEvery product is independently selected by editors.
