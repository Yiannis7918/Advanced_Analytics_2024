It was first unveiled to the public in 2017 at the Defence and\nSecurity Equipment International (DSEI) conference in London and is being\ndeveloped by UK DragonFire, a collaboration consisting of MBDA UK, Leonardo\nUK, QinetiQ and the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl). As a\ntechnology demonstrator, it will be used to assess laser directed-energy\nweapons and their potential applications within the British Armed Forces.^[1]\n\n## Development[edit]\n\nThe weapon was first shown publicly at the 2017 DSEI conference in London.\nDevelopment of the technology demonstrator was to be carried out by a\npartnership between the British Ministry of Defence (MOD) and private\nindustry. UK DragonFire is the result of contracts worth \u00a3100 million \u2013 of\nwhich \u00a330 million was awarded by the MoD's Chief Scientific Advisor's Research\nProgramme \u2013 from various companies, led by MBDA UK with QinetiQ, Leonardo,\nGKN, Arke, BAE Systems and Marshall Land Systems participating, to develop a\ntechnology demonstrator.^[2]\n\nTrials were to begin in 2018, followed by a major demonstration in 2019;\nhowever, the COVID-19 pandemic and technical problems caused delays. It was\nultimately deployed on trials in 2022 on the ranges in the Outer Hebrides in\nScotland.^[3] According to MBDA, these initial low-power trials proved\nDragonFire's ability to track air and sea targets with exceptionally high\naccuracy. This was followed by high-power trials in November 2022, where the\nweapon engaged targets using its high-power laser in operationally\nrepresentative scenarios.^[4]^[5] DragonFire engaged an airborne target in\nexercises in Scotland in January 2024. The MOD stated: \"The range of\nDragonFire is classified, but it is a line-of-sight weapon and can engage with\nany visible target. The precision required is equivalent to hitting a \u00a31 coin\n(23 mm) from a kilometre away.\"^[6]^[7] It has been tested against mortar\nrounds and drones,^[8] and fitted to a Wolfhound armoured vehicle.^[9]\n\nIn April 2024, the MOD announced that new procurement rules had increased the\nrate of development of the weapon and, as a result, it is expected to be in\nservice onboard Royal Navy ships from 2027 instead of the originally planned\n2032.^[10] Defence Secretary Grant Shapps stated that an early version of the\nweapon could be used by Ukraine against Russia during the Russo-Ukrainian\nWar.^[11]\n\n## Characteristics[edit]\n\nDragonFire uses UK-pioneered beam-combining technology to deliver a laser beam\nwith increased power density, reduced defeat times and increased effective\nrange.^[12] This is achieved, in part, through the use of tens of glass\nfibres; however, the full technical approach remains classified.^[3] The laser\nand its associated targeting systems, including an electro-optical camera and\nsecond lower-power laser for imaging and tracking, are mounted to a\nturret.^[3] The laser is reportedly in the 50 kW class and is designed to\ndefend land and maritime targets from threats such as missiles and\nmortars.^[13] Its energy demands may be met by a Flywheel Energy Storage\nSystem (FESS), a joint UK\u2013US innovation currently in development.^[14] The\nrange of the weapon is undisclosed classified information. Cost per firing is\nvery low; it has been stated as \u00a310.^[11]\n\nThe UK envisages high-energy laser weapons, like DragonFire, onboard future\nRoyal Navy warships, British Army armoured vehicles and fighter aircraft of\nthe Royal Air Force, including the BAE Systems Tempest;^[15] it aims to\ndemonstrate these concepts on board a Type 23 frigate and a Wolfhound armoured\nvehicle.^[16]\n\nIt was reported to have been successfully tested in January 2024, and was\nexpected to become operational in 2027.^[11]\n\n## Similar weapons[edit]\n\n  * Iron Beam (Israel)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Hughes, Owen (1 May 2017). \"UK military to begin work on high-energy laser weapons for British armed forces\".
