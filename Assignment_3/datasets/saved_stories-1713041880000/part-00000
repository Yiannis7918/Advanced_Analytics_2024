Martin Van Buren has just been sworn in for his fourth term\nas president. Every state from the Carolinas on south secedes from the Union.\nThe U.S. Army occupies Richmond to keep Virginia from joining them.\nSeparatists take to the western mountains and organize a guerrilla campaign.\nIn Washington, Van Buren assumes dictatorial powers, hangs traitors on a whim.\nThe sons of the Old Dominion have to choose between the Union they have been\nraised to admire and the state they deeply adore.\n\nAn intriguing alternate history? Not quite. The novel in which this story\nappears flashed forward in time, not back. Well, actually, it did both:\nPublished in 1836 but with a date on the title page of 1856, as if remembering\na war that had already occurred, The Partisan Leader: A Tale of the Future\ndidn\u2019t so much relate a different version of the Civil War as prophesy its\ncoming, missing the eventual start date by only a dozen years.\n\n1/1 Skip Ad Continue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE\n\nThat makes it the little-known granddaddy of a whole subgenre of American\nliterature (and now film): blood-drenched imaginings of what it would be like\nto witness the crackup of the country. Americans have always been at once\nhorrified and titillated by the prospect of these states becoming disunited.\nIf the U.S. is an \u201cimagined community,\u201d as the anthropologist Benedict\nAnderson described the modern nation-state, one of the things its citizens\nmost love to imagine is its violent undoing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLately, even more so than usual, a profound sense of decline and\ndisintegration has come to define the national mood. How obvious, then, even\ninevitable, to pair this primordial form of American catastrophism with the\nevidently deathless genre of big-budget disaster movies. Americans fighting\nAmericans, the country falling apart, the breakdown of civic order\u2014what could\nbe more popcorn-worthy than that?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a genre, disunion fantasy fiction has often showcased bad politics and even\nworse art. The hypothetical scenarios of such works tend to be hilariously\nimplausible, the authors\u2019 intentions murky at best\u2014or, sometimes, clearly\nmercenary. Even in this context, however, Alex Garland\u2019s much-ballyhooed Civil\nWar stands out for its eagerness to exploit popular fears of mass political\nviolence without offering any meaningful reflection on the underlying factors\nthat have led to it. Experience it in IMAX! the promotional poster urges, in a\ntone that sits uncomfortably with the director\u2019s claim that he made the film\nas a warning of what could occur if we are not careful. If the past is any\nguide, such macabre depictions of what Edmund Wilson called \u201cpatriotic gore\u201d\nmay only accustom us to the likelihood that it will.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObsessing about a potential future civil war was a favorite activity of\nAmericans in the years before they ventured into the fields to murder one\nanother en masse. As the crisis over slavery deepened, a bumper crop of new\nnovels depicted a Southern breakaway movement and a bloody conflict with the\nNorth. The books\u2019 authors tended not to deplore the possibility but to welcome\nit. They wanted readers to envision, from the safety of their armchairs, what\nthe destruction of the nation would look like\u2014and to help bring it on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Partisan Leader, though published under a pseudonym, was widely known to\nbe the work of a Virginian named Nathaniel Beverley Tucker, a son of the\nslavocracy who taught at the College of William and Mary and landed sooner\nthan most Southerners on the conclusion that secession offered the only\nguarantee for the continuation of Southern institutions\u2014slavery above all. As\nearly as 1820, Tucker swore never to rest until he saw the Union \u201cshattered\ninto pieces.\u201d A professor of law at William and Mary for nearly 20 years,\nTucker trained a generation of Southern leaders in how to think about the\nConstitution. Later, his students would lead their states out of the Union,\njust as Tucker had hoped.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Tucker\u2019s ambitions as an educator went beyond formal instruction. Turning\nto fiction and using the novels of Walter Scott as a model, he wanted to help\nSoutherners imagine how the breakup of the Union might happen, and to show\nwhere their loyalties should lie if it did.\n\nDuff Green, a prominent Washington publisher and close ally of South Carolina\nSen. John C. Calhoun, printed 2,000 copies of the book in two volumes. The\nSouthern Literary Messenger, an influential periodical then edited by Edgar\nAllan Poe (who corresponded with Tucker and sought advice from him), praised\nthe artistry and plausibility of the novel, as well as its argument for\nSouthern resistance to federal tyranny: \u201cThe reader rises from the perusal of\nthe book with solemn impressions of the probable truth of all the writer\u2019s\nspeculations; and he naturally asks himself, by what means the evils he has\nseen depicted may be prevented.\u201d Northern journals ignored the scandalous\nwork, and booksellers refused to stock it, but The Partisan Leader found new\nrelevance a quarter century later, with the secession of the seven\nsouthernmost states. In 1861 a New York publisher reprinted the book with the\ntitle A Key to the Disunion Conspiracy. The novel seemed to have predicted the\nfuture. Events were following Tucker\u2019s script.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeizing on Tucker\u2019s prescient vision, other writers saw a market for similar\nworks, only now they added elaborately detailed portrayals of interstate\nviolence\u2014the CGI of the time. In 1859 John Beauchamp Jones, a successful\nMaryland novelist (also once praised by Poe), published Wild Southern Scenes:\nA Tale of Disunion! And Border War! Thirteen Southern states abandon Congress,\nthen send an army to occupy New York City and abduct free Black people and\nbring them back as slaves. A villainous Northern general proclaims himself\n\u201cLord Protector of the United States,\u201d invades the South, and wields the\nguillotine to gruesome effect. Great Britain leaps into the fray, keen to take\nadvantage of the chaos and reclaim its lost colonies. North and South join\ntogether to expel the foreign foe. The Constitution is restored.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA New York\u2013based businessmen\u2019s magazine found the book full of \u201cingenuity and\ninvention\u201d and hoped it would \u201chave the effect of opening the eyes of the more\nconservative to the terrible results that will follow from the sectional\nmadness and folly now disturbing the country.\u201d By contrast, Edmund Ruffin, an\neccentric, long-maned agricultural reformer from Virginia and a passionate\nadvocate of Southern separatism, thought Jones\u2019 book \u201cvery foolish\u201d\u2014especially\nits feel-good ending\u2014and decided he could do better. The result, Anticipations\nof the Future (1860), was both impressively timely and remarkably unhinged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe novel, serialized in a pro-secession South Carolina newspaper, then\npackaged as a book by a top Southern publisher, took the form of fictional\ndispatches by a correspondent to an English newspaper about a crisis following\nthe Lower South\u2019s secession from the Union. To suppress the rebellion, the\npresident of the United States, New York\u2019s William Seward, sends an army into\nVirginia, prompting the rest of the slave states to leave. A gruesome fight\nensues, climaxing with the wholesale slaughter of mixed-race Northern armies,\ndescribed by Ruffin in gory detail. The abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison is\nhanged, his corpse defiled by vultures. Meanwhile, the Western states secede\nand join the rebellion. Northern cities go up in smoke, leaving \u201cmany\nthousands of charred and partly consumed skeletons.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWriting these scenes, Ruffin confided to his diary, was \u201calike amusing to my\nmind, & ... conducive to immediate pleasure.\u201d\n\nOnly about 400 readers bothered to pick up Ruffin\u2019s overwrought novel, much to\nthe author\u2019s chagrin. That might have been because the future he anticipated\nwas already becoming a reality. In the novel, South Carolina seizes Fort\nSumter in Charleston Harbor\u2014just where the actual fighting would begin only\nmonths after the publication of Ruffin\u2019s book, when the 67-year-old author, a\nvolunteer with the militia, was himself given the high honor of firing one of\nthe first shots in the war he had fantasized about with such pleasure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe unfathomable devastation that ensued, leaving three-quarters of a million\ndead, hundreds of thousands more wounded in body and mind, and much of the\nSouth a smoldering ruin, took the fun out of imagining what a nation-rending\nconflict would look like. The genre disappeared for a time. Ruffin shot\nhimself in the head after the surrender at Appomattox. The reality of Southern\nsecession hadn\u2019t matched up to the turgid fantasies of his fiction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the decades after the Civil War, expectations of national division over\nslavery were replaced by fears that mass immigration would undermine American\nunity. In 1880 Canadian-born San Francisco lawyer and journalist Pierton W.\nDooner published Last Days of the Republic, which depicted a Chinese army\noverthrowing the Pacific states, then marching east all the way to Washington:\n\u201cThe very name of the United States of America was thus blotted from the\nrecord of nations and peoples.\u201d\n\nPerhaps one of the strangest disunion-fantasy novels ever published was\nImperium in Imperio (1899), by Sutton E. Griggs, a 27-year-old preacher and\nson of formerly enslaved parents. The novel revolves around a secret\ngovernment of, by, and for Black Americans, based in a bunker beneath a Texas\ncollege. Devoted to racial progress and fighting discrimination, the Imperium\nrecruits a rising generation of ambitious, educated Black men who have grown\nfrustrated at being denied the most basic rights and privileges of\ncitizenship. \u201cThey grew to hate a flag that would float in an undisturbed\nmanner over such a condition of affairs,\u201d Griggs writes. \u201cThey began to abuse\nand execrate a national government that would not protect them against color\nprejudice, but on the contrary actually practiced it itself.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a black postmaster is lynched in South Carolina\u2014an event that really\nhappened, a year before Griggs published his novel\u2014the Imperium decides to\ntake Austin and declare war on the United States. \u201cThus,\u201d the president of the\nImperium proclaims, \u201cwill the Negro have an empire of his own.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe turmoil of the 1960s and \u201970s, breeding a new wave of concern about\nnational failure and societal collapse, led to another boomlet in fictional\ndepictions of the United States\u2019 cracking up. The Texas-Israeli War: 1999,\nwritten by sci-fi authors Jake Saunders and the late Howard Waldrop at the\npeak of the 1973 oil crisis, depicted the reestablishment of the independent\nLone Star Republic in a world torn apart by biological and chemical warfare.\nAfter Texans kidnap the American president, mercenaries from the Jewish State\nattempt to rescue him. On Wings of Song (1979), by Thomas Disch, portrayed an\nAmerica destroyed by economic inequality and culture war, divided between a\nliberal \u201cBabylon\u201d on the coasts and a semiautonomous conservative region,\n\u201cColumbia,\u201d in the heartland, populated by \u201cundergoders\u201d\u2014an astute depiction\nof the rural-urban divide that would only worsen in the coming years. In\nMargaret Atwood\u2019s now-canonical The Handmaid\u2019s Tale (1985), a turn to\nreligious fundamentalism brings a second civil war and the rise of a\ntheocratic, women-enslaving dictatorship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA few novels rejected dystopian warnings in favor of, like the antebellum\nSouthern writers, actually proposing disunion as an improvement on the status\nquo\u2014a stance shared by authors of vastly different political stripes.\nEcotopia, a 1975 novel by the environmentalist Ernest Callenbach, imagined the\nestablishment of a separatist West Coast republic whose residents live in\ndynamic, sustainable harmony with one another and with nature, while far on\nthe other side of the political divide, William Luther Pierce\u2019s The Turner\nDiaries (1978) records the events of the \u201cGreat Revolution of 1991\u20131999,\u201d in\nwhich Black people, Jews, and other non-Aryans are slaughtered and white \u201crace\ntraitors\u201d hanged from lampposts. Seizing nuclear bombs from a military base, a\nshadowy group called the Order starts an atomic civil war with the federal\ngovernment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt can hardly be a good thing that the antebellum era\u2019s obsession with\nconcocting increasingly bloody disunion scenarios has reappeared with fresh\nvigor in recent years. There have been too many next-civil-war books to count,\nand most, true to the form, have been absolute garbage\u2014maudlin, contrived,\nclich\u00e9d.\n\nBut not all. In Ben H. Winters\u2019 Underground Airlines (2016), set in a 21^st-\ncentury United States where slavery remains legal in four states and the\ntitular rescue network helps \u201cPersons Bound to Labor\u201d escape to Canada, the\nalt-history is only a provocative premise for airing matters relevant in both\nits fictional world and our real one: What compromises hold a country\ntogether, and when are those not worth the cost? Omar El Akkad\u2019s American War\n(2017) shows a country split apart at the end of this century over an attempt\nto ban fossil fuels. El Akkad at once lays out a clever, thought-provoking\nscenario\u2014more stable Middle Eastern powers intervene as the U.S. often has in\nthe civil wars of other nations\u2014and delves into complexities of identity,\nloyalty, and the human cost of civil conflict. Christopher Brown\u2019s harrowing\nTropic of Kansas (2017) paints a harrowing picture of a nation in the grip of\nauthoritarianism and ecological collapse and celebrates the relentless pursuit\nof justice in the face of overwhelming odds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd now we have director Alex Garland\u2019s new film, with a title as bland as the\nmovie itself. Like so much in our culture right now, Civil War isn\u2019t nearly\nweighty enough to bear the load of discourse that\u2019s been based on it. Focused\non the ethical dilemmas and psychological torments involved in war\nphotography\u2014which, OK?\u2014the movie takes advantage of our dark fascination with\nthe possibility of political polarization leading to constitutional crisis and\npolitical violence, while refusing to actually explore those themes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Related From Slate\n\n#### Laura Miller\n\n### Station Eleven and the Invasion of Literary Novelists Into Sci-Fi\n\nRead More\n\nFor all the ear-splitting explosions and hair-raising exchanges of gunfire\nacross a variety of modern American landscapes\u2014and, yes, the IMAX experience\nis intense\u2014the film seems to be conscious of its own essentially pornographic\nnature. There is something cheap and unseemly in the way the camera lingers on\na pile of human bodies, or the Lincoln Memorial blown to smithereens. Just as\nSouthern secessionist Edmund Ruffin found writing gory scenes of executions\nand massacres \u201cconducive to immediate pleasure,\u201d Joel, one of the war\nphotographers in Civil War (played by Wagner Moura), looks out on a night sky\nfilled with arcing mortar shells and grunts, \u201cThis gunfire is getting me so\nfucking hard!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe viewer is meant to be implicated, and we are. But instead of any\nprofounder meditations on why mass slaughter both attracts and sickens us\u2014for\neven Joel is eventually reduced to a puddle of tears\u2014the film offers 90 more\nminutes of picturesque wreckage, bone-chilling executions, and, finally, the\neagerly panted-after \u201cmoney shot\u201d (a phrase one of the journalists actually\nuses as the film\u2019s climactic scene unfolds). At least Ruffin had an excuse for\npleasing himself by turning his fantasies of American carnage into art: He\nwanted to bring it about. Garland claims he wants his film to do the opposite,\nbut it\u2019s strange, then, that not a single line or moment even implicitly\nalludes to what if anything could have been done to keep things from reaching\nsuch a breaking point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn interviews, the filmmaker has claimed, \u201cIt\u2019s a film about the product of\npolarization and division.\u201d But if we are to understand that the president\n(played by Nick Offerman), who appears only fleetingly in the movie, has\nturned \u201cfascistic,\u201d as Garland explains\u2014claiming a third term, abolishing the\nFBI, bombing American citizens\u2014why is it bad that insurgents have risen up to\noverthrow him? If it\u2019s not bad, how can the movie be described, as lead\nactress Kirsten Dunst has put it, as \u201canti-war\u201d?\n\nThis deeply unserious film is not interested in probing those tensions, or,\nmore to the point, its creator is too scared of alienating half the public by\naddressing them. It\u2019s neither pedantic nor partisan to object to such\nexplosive material being used to such shallow ends. Far from deterring the\nviolence it depicts, Civil War may well convince some content-addled\nmoviegoers that it sure would be something to see.\n\nTweet Share Share Comment\n\n  * History\n  * War\n  * United States\n  * Confederacy\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### About\n\n  * About Us\n  * Work With Us\n  * Contact\n  * Pitch Guidelines\n  * Send Us Tips\n  * Corrections\n  * Commenting\n  * Reprints\n\n#### Subscriptions\n\n  * Subscribe\n  * Sign In\n  * Account\n  * Subscription FAQs\n  * Podcast FAQs\n  * Newsletters\n  * Customer Support\n\n#### Advertising\n\n  * AdChoices\n  * Cookie Preferences\n\nSlate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\n#### Follow Us\n\nFacebook Twitter Instagram YouTube RSS Feed\n\n  * User Agreement\n  * Privacy Policy\n\nAll contents \u00a9 2024 The Slate Group LLC.
