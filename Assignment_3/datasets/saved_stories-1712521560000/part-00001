Drawing a parallel, just as computer user interfaces\ntransitioned from text-based Command Line Interfaces to graphical ones, I\nbelieve we might witness a similar evolution with generative AI.\n\nIn fact, generative AI might play a crucial role in ushering in the next\niteration of the web: the true Web 3.0.\n\n(\u201cBut,\u201d you might interject, \u201cwe already have a Web 3.0.\u201d To that, I\u2019ll\nprovide my response at the end of this article.)\n\nTo understand why this might be the case, let\u2019s briefly revisit past\ntransitions. Bear with me, as this won\u2019t take long, and you\u2019re likely already\nfamiliar with this history. However, it\u2019s important to review it to logically\nbuild upon it.\n\n## From Web 1.0 to Web 2.0\n\n### Web 1.0: The Television for Documents\n\nWhen the web first appeared, the real innovation was the ability to link to\ndocuments from within other documents. This was essentially the extent of the\ninteractivity that came with what later became known as Web 1.0.\n\nThe client\u2019s only agency was to choose which page of predefined content to\nnavigate to next. In essence, the web at that time was akin to a television\nfor content: you could change the channel (i.e., page), but you couldn\u2019t alter\nhow the shows looked.\n\n### Web 2.0: It\u2019s... Alive!\n\nThe advent of Web 2.0 marked a significant shift: dynamic HTML. In other\nwords, this meant that web pages could be built on the fly and display bespoke\ncontent for each user.\n\nIn practice, this allowed developers to build websites where two users could\nvisit the same page (for example, facebook.com/index.php) and see completely\ndifferent content. To achieve this, servers had to pull pre-recorded data from\na database and insert it into predefined HTML templates.\n\nThis same technology also meant that a more significant change could now take\nplace: platforms could be built for and around user-generated content.\n\nOver time, the tools for Web 2.0 became more sophisticated and complex, but\nthe core principle remained the same: project data from a database into a\ndynamically generated template. This principle continues to underpin the\nstructure and functionality of many of today\u2019s most popular websites.\n\n## Setting the ground work\n\nOne aspect that has been continuously optimized is the process of determining\nwhat data to display to a specific user. These processes have grown more\ncomplex over time, taking into account an increasing number of factors. At\nsome point, artificial intelligence was introduced.\n\n### Step 1: AI as a mediator\n\nAt the beginning, AI was tasked to be a mediator between the database and the\ntemplate. The server continues to pull data from a database and display it\nwithin a template. However, the method of data retrieval has shifted from\nbeing purely deterministic to incorporate more probabilistic aspects.\n\nThis approach still aligns closely with the Web 2.0 model.\n\nThe key difference is that past user behavior now influences the algorithm's\ndecisions on what data to pull. To those not keeping track of how these things\nwork, the involvement of artificial intelligence might not be apparent.\n\n### Step 2: AI as a creator\n\nThe advent of generative AI has introduced a different type of user\nexperience. In this case, the displayed data isn't waiting in a database for\nthe server to retrieve and display. Instead, the server takes a direct and\nspecific instruction from the user to generate content that is, to some\nextent, unique.\n\nThis still resembles Web 2.0, albeit less so. We continue to use templates to\ndisplay content, but instead of pulling the data from a database, it is\ngenerated by an algorithm.\n\n## The leap forward\n\nAll of this is to say that there are some advancements on the web axis,\nalthough they are relatively small. Up until this point, we only altered two\nmain elements that describe the web in its 2.0 incarnation: how data is\ngenerated (by AI instead of by users) and how that data is pulled (again by\nAI, instead of deterministic algorithms).\n\nSome might label this as Web 2.1, while others might see it as closer to Web\n2.9. It's almost the next step, but not quite there yet.\n\n### What's missing?\n\nThe only part where the AI isn't involved yet, at least in a user-facing\nmanner, is in how the data is presented. Until now, this was done using pre-\nmade templates. Yes, more of these templates are now developed using AI, but\nthat's not the point. It's the predefined part that is key here.\n\nIf AI models mature enough, it won't be a stretch to see websites whose very\narchitecture is adapted to the user's needs in (near) real-time. The content\ncan be static and stored in databases, but the way it is presented can\ndrastically change from one user to the other.\n\n### Morphing...\n\nThus, the articles on nytimes.com will still be written and meticulously fact-\nchecked by the Times reporters. But instead of reading their coverage on the\n2024 solar eclipse, you'll ask the website to generate a podcast \u2014 and by a\npodcast, I don't mean someone just reading the article.\n\nImagine, instead, the article transformed into an episode of The Daily where\nMichael Barbaro discusses the piece with the reporter who wrote it. Or maybe\nas an episode of Office Ladies. Or maybe you want it as a video in the style\nof your favorite YouTube creator, Mustard.\n\nIn all these instances, the content will stay exactly the same, but the\narticle written and edited by professional journalists will serve as the basis\nfor AI-generated content in other formats.\n\n(As an aside, you\u2019d also need to pay the Office Ladies or Mustard a fee to use\ntheir voices/styles/etc., either as a pay-as-you-go or as a subscription. This\nrepresents a potential new business model for content creators in the era of\nAI and Web 3.0.)\n\n### ...and shapeshifting\n\nThe website may also shapeshift to better serve you its content in the format\nyou desire. So it may look like a podcast app if you prefer audio, or... even\nas a Super Mario game if that's what you desire.\n\nAll generated by an AI. So all the developers at The New York Times would have\nto provide are the API to fetch the (base) content, and a way for the\n\"readers\" to interact with the AI model, either via raw text-based\ninstructions or a more simplified button-based interface.\n\nOr maybe you want to master the TCP/IP stack. You go to the excellent TCP/IP\nguide but there's just too much to learn. No problem! The new website, built\nusing web3 tech, will help you learn in a breadth-first manner, allowing you\nto soak in the new knowledge layer by layer (pun not intended!), avoiding the\nusual abandonment mid-course (again, not intended).\n\nBut if you think that's still pretty boring, you can ask the AI to transform\nthe course into a \"The Office\" version where Michael Scott teaches the Dunder\nMifflin employees all about TCP/IP.\n\nJust as today, two people visiting the very same URL can see totally different\ncontent, those using Web 3.0 will experience completely unique interfaces when\nusing the exact same website.\n\nThe possibilities are limitless.\n\nAnd the cherry on the cake: the amazing backward-compatibility that's baked\nright into the web, means that sites built for different versions can all live\ntogether side-by-side and help keep the internet teaming with whatever the\ninternet is teaming with!\n\n## But what about the decentralized Web 3.0?\n\nGiven the length of this article, I\u2019ll keep this brief. It would have been\nmore fitting, and potentially even more impactful, to name that particular\ntech stack \u201cThe Internet 2.0\u201d.\n\nThis name suggests a complete overhaul or upgrade of the entire internet, not\njust the web. The term \u201cInternet 2.0\u201d would encompass advancements beyond the\nweb, including improvements in infrastructure, protocols, speed, and perhaps\neven the incorporation of new technologies like quantum computing.\n\nThe term \u201cWeb 3.0\u201d implies an evolution of the web as we know it, but the\nblockchain\u2019s vision goes beyond that. It\u2019s not just about creating a new type\nof website or improving web-based applications. It\u2019s about changing the\nfundamental way in which data is stored and transactions are conducted online.\nIt\u2019s about creating a decentralized network where data is not controlled by\nany single entity and transactions are transparent and immutable.\n\nEND OF FILE\n\n", "frontpage": false}
