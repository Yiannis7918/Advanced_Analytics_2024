But\nwhat tactics will companies use to keep a customer once they\u2019ve made that\nsale?\n\nAccording to Deloitte, the average company spends around 58% of its marketing\nbudget on digital activities, which will include ways of manipulating a user\ninto not canceling a subscription.\n\nSometimes these practices can verge on illegality. In 2023, the Federal Trade\nCommission (FTC) dished out a record $245m fine for video game developer, Epic\nGames, as part of a wider settlement over \u201cdark patterns\u201d \u2014 manipulative\nmarketing practices designed to trick Fortnite players into unwanted\npurchases. The FTC also filed a lawsuit against Amazon for implementing\nsimilar tactics on its website.\n\nBut just how widespread are these practices today? To find out, we have\nanalyzed the marketing practices of 40 major online subscription services to\nsee whether they use hidden tricks to influence their customers when\ncanceling. To investigate the topic further, we have also surveyed 1,035 U.S.\nadults to find out their opinions on dark pattern practices.\n\n## Key findings\n\n  * The average subscriber would encounter 6.2 dark patterns when trying to cancel a service, and this would take an average of 6.7 clicks/taps to get from the homepage to cancellation.\n  * The gaming platform, Humble Choice, had the most (12) instances of dark patterns when users tried to cancel their subscriptions.\n  * Delivery services like Amazon Prime were on average the worst for dark patterns when canceling, with an average of 7.3 patterns per cancellation, closely followed by gaming subscriptions (6.8 patterns per cancellation).\n  * 76% of U.S. adults believe that online subscription services make it intentionally difficult for users to cancel, with 92% agreeing that they\u2019d be more likely to switch to a competitor brand as a result.\n  * Of the major subscription services analyzed, 87.5% are most guilty of \u2018guilt copy\u2019, where the content is written in a way to shame their customers for leaving, while 77.5% are intentionally using confusing design elements to stop subscribers from canceling.\n\n## What is a dark pattern?\n\nFor the purposes of this research, we define a dark pattern as practices that\naim to deliberately misdirect or confuse users when trying to cancel a\nsubscription to a product or service. These could involve things like\nmanipulative copywriting, deliberately confusing web or app design, or other\ntactics that aim to misdirect and push users away from ending their\nsubscriptions.\n\nDuring this study, we reviewed various research pieces and reports on \u201cdark\npatterns\u201d. This allowed us to include a variety of different manipulative\npractices across the subscription cancelation process.\n\nDefinitions came from the likes of the Federal Trade Commission, Princeton\nUniversity, and e-commerce platform, Shopify.\n\nFor our report, we reviewed the number of times one of these dark patterns was\npresent when a user tried to cancel their subscription in five key industries.\n\nOn top of this, we surveyed more than 1,000 U.S. adults who regularly use\nsubscription services about dark patterns, and whether a business\u2019s attempts\nto influence their behavior would have the desired effect.\n\n## How many Americans encounter dark patterns?\n\nIn total, more than three-quarters (76%) of people believe that subscription\nservices make it difficult for users to cancel, and 92% agree that they would\nbe more likely to use a competitor service if they feel the business is\nmanipulating them into retaining their custom.\n\nTo make matters worse, 89% of people admitted that these practices would make\nthem trust the provider less, preferring instead to have the final say\nthemselves.\n\nHulu\u2019s design adds an extra step to the cancelation process by encouraging\nusers to switch to different subscription tiers or schedule a pause in their\nsubscription which will later be automatically started again. This could be\nconsidered an example of obstructive design as well as \u2018nagging\u2019.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that dark patterns impact trust and encourage users to leave via\ncompetitors. With the FTC commissioning reports investigating the rise of dark\npatterns we wanted to know which specific patterns were the most common when\npeople tried to unsubscribe from various services.\n\n## Most common dark patterns\n\nThe most common dark pattern we found was guilt-inducing copywriting, with\n87.5% of the major brands we looked at deliberately writing text (referred to\nas copy/copywriting) on their websites to make the user feel shame in\ncanceling their subscription. Examples include \u201cwe\u2019re sorry to see you go\u201d and\n\u201care you sure you want to lose these benefits\u201d are worked into the user\nexperience to guilt-trip customers into retention.\n\nThe below table reveals how often we found various dark patterns in our\nresearch when trying to unsubscribe from different services.\n\nDark patterns| What is this?| % of services that feature this  \n---|---|---  \nGuilt copy| Copywriting designed to make users feel guilty for canceling the\nservice.| 87.5%  \nContinue button placed next to cancel| A type of visual misdirection,\nencouraging users through design to click cancel instead of continue\ncancelation.| 77.5%  \nRejoin email (or buttons)| The service places a large emphasis on rejoin\nbuttons immediately after cancelation and in follow-up email remarketing.|\n57.5%  \nConfirmshaming| Copywriting that shames users by highlighting how they are\nharming themselves by leaving this service.| 55.0%  \nObstruction| The user is faced with designed barriers, making it hard for them\nto cancel the service.| 52.5%  \nFOMO| Using scarcity to highlight what features users will miss out on if they\nunsubscribe.| 47.5%  \nForced reasoning| Forcing users to give a reason for canceling, further\ninducing guilt.| 45.0%  \nNagging| The service will offer alternatives, like lower tiers of\nsubscription, or offering to fix the problem instead of canceling.| 42.5%  \nMisdirection| Using design to steer users away from canceling.| 42.5%  \nDisguised Ads| Ads that are disguised as other kinds of content or navigation,\nin order to get you to click on them.| 37.5%  \nPreselection| The user is presented with a default option that has already\nbeen selected for them, such as not canceling and keeping the subscription.|\n25.0%  \nTrick wording| The user is misled into not canceling, due to confusing\nlanguage.| 22.5%  \nRejoin discounts| Giving users discounts for rejoining to get them back after\ncanceling.| 20.0%  \nRoach Motel| When subscribing is easy but canceling is difficult, typically\nrequiring a call to cancel, while some may accept emails.| 17.5%  \nVisual interference| The user expects to see information presented in a clear\nand predictable way on the page, but it is hidden, obscured or disguised.|\n12.5%  \nFake scarcity| This could include a service highlighting how the price may not\nbe the same if you return, or how you will lose access to content even though\nyou have days left until your subscription ends.| 10.0%  \nTrick questions| Confusing language (such as a double negative) is used in\nquestions. As a result, it becomes much harder to act.| 10.0%  \nButler lies| This could involve copywriting that says how \u201cYour files are not\nprotected\u201d when there is no way they can know that, which almost sounds\nthreatening to the user.| 7.5%  \nOpt-out defaults| Defaulting users into choices not aligned with their goal,\nsuch as having to opt out of a smaller subscription instead of canceling.|\n2.5%  \n  \n### Guilt-inducing copy\n\nMarketers and advertisers have been harnessing the power of guilt as an\nemotion for decades, from charities to cosmetics. However, services like\nAmazon and Netflix have contributed to a culture of \u2018subscription guilt\u2019,\nwhere users are made to feel shame for not properly utilizing all a platform\u2019s\nservice has to offer.\n\nIn our survey of more than 1,000 U.S. adults, 30% noted the prevalence of\npersuasive wording to try and force their retention. It should be noted that,\nfor those who aren\u2019t marketers, this is unlikely to be something that is\nnoticed in day-to-day web browsing and purchasing so the figure is likely much\nhigher, like the 87.5% of instances we found.\n\nThe copywriting here encourages users to jump back into the subscription\n(video gaming in this instance), and not cancel, with \u201cone last game\u201d, a\nstylistic choice designed to sound like a fellow gamer or friend.\n\nWe found guilt-inducing copy in Paramount+\u2019s cancellation process which states\nthey were \u201csad to see you go\u201d, or Qobuz who are \u201calways sad to see our members\nleave\u201d or EA who asks \u201cis this really game over?\u201d This could leave a lasting\nimpression on a user as they leave, making them feel like they are going to be\ngenuinely missed. If a person said they were sad to see you go in real life it\nmay have some form of emotional impact.\n\n### Confirmshaming\n\nSimilar to guilt-inducing copy, confirmshaming sees companies ask if users are\n\u201creally\u201d sure they want to cancel, reminding them that if they do so, they\nwill lose benefits. This typically occurs during the cancelation process as a\nway to convince users to stay. Sometimes it can be as simple as Amazon Prime\nwriting, \u201cBy canceling, you will no longer be eligible for your unclaimed\nPrime exclusive offers\u201d highlighting the offers lost.\n\nOthers, like Walmart+, state during cancelation, a subscriber can \u201cSave up to\n90 hours\u201d which is, according to them, \u201cTime back you can use however you\nwant\u201d. They could have taken this further to be a textbook definition of\nconfirmshaming by changing the cancel button to read \u201cI don\u2019t want to save 90\nhours of time\u201d. However, highlighting this supposed time saving during the\ncancelation is still one way to divert users\u2019 attention away from their true\ngoal of leaving and shame them into willingly, in this case, losing 90 hours\nof their time.\n\n#### Guilt copy and confirmshaming actively annoy two in five consumers\n\nWe asked our consumer survey panel how guilt-inducing copywriting and\nconfirmshaming make them feel by providing examples from our research. Over\ntwo-fifths (41.2%) said text like this annoyed them, and the second biggest\nproportion (21.1%) said it didn\u2019t bother them.\n\nOver one in six (17.5%) said it made them angry, 16.3% said it amused them,\nwhile 15.2% said they felt attacked by the brand.\n\nInterestingly, only 14.4% said copywriting like this actually made them feel\nguilty, perhaps indicating this practice isn\u2019t worth a brand\u2019s time.\n\n### Obstructions and confusing web design\n\nOur survey respondents also highlighted that they had noticed deliberate\nwebsite and app designs that make it hard to cancel (43%). When analyzing the\nservices, we see this quite often with 77.5% intentionally misdirecting\nthrough the design of cancelation and continue buttons, 57.5% making rejoin\nbuttons prominent on the page or in email marketing, and 52.5% doing other\nobstructive design choices.\n\nThe \u2018Rejoin\u2019 button from Humble is in blue encouraging an immediate re-sign-up\nonce cancelation has happened, which matches the blue \u2018Cancel\u2019 button from a\nstep before which could mislead some\n\nOther common dark patterns we found were: FOMO, highlighting what users are\nmissing out on when they leave, (47.5%), forced reasoning where people are\nforced to provide a reason for leaving, further inducing guilt (45%), nagging\n(42.5%) where services offer alternatives to cancelation like lower tiers of\nthe same subscription, and misdirection (42.5%) where design steers users away\nfrom the cancel area or button on the website/app.\n\nOne other important dark pattern we observed, but only 17.5% of the time, was\nthe \u2018Roach Motel\u2019 pattern where companies require people to contact them\ndirectly outside of the account settings to unsubscribe. This tactic often\ninvolves being made to call sales teams to cancel who will do their very best\nto talk individuals out of leaving. Fortunately, it\u2019s not too common a\npractice, however, more than one in six services forcing this route of\ncancelation may be considered too many for some.\n\n## Dark patterns per industry\n\nOur research shows that of the five biggest sectors for subscriptions in the\nUS, delivery services use these dark patterns most frequently.\n\nIndustry| Average dark patterns per subscription platform  \n---|---  \nDelivery| 7.3  \nGaming| 6.8  \nCloud storage| 6.4  \nStreaming| 5.7  \nMusic| 5.1  \n  \nWe identified an average of 7.3 dark patterns per platform, more than gaming\n(6.8) and cloud storage (6.4) services. Of the delivery sector\u2019s major\nplayers, Amazon Prime gave users the hardest time when canceling a\nsubscription, with no less than 11 dark patterns on display.\n\nOur report echoes similar findings from the FTC in June 2023, when they filed\nan official complaint against Amazon for enrolling customers without their\nconsent and \u2018sabotaging\u2019 cancelation attempts with dark patterns.\n\n## Worst platforms for dark patterns during cancelation\n\nWhile Amazon Prime and its gaming and video counterparts are among the most\nprolific when it comes to dark patterns, gaming platform Humble and its Choice\nservice rely more on dark patterns during their cancelation process, with no\nless than 12 examples found in our research.\n\nHumble offers users a discount when they\u2019ve decided to cancel, an instance of\n\u2018nagging\u2019 and one more step for a user looking to end their subscription.\n\nHumble set itself apart from its competitors as an ethical alternative in the\ngaming subscription space, with 5% of a user\u2019s monthly fee supporting\ncharities. While Humble has raised more than $240m to date for good causes,\nthere is no hiding from the hurdles their customers must jump through to\ncancel their subscriptions.\n\nCloud-based storage provider Dropbox also features in the top five, with 11\ndark patterns in use in its cancelation process.\n\nPlatforms| Industry| Dark patterns discovered when canceling  \n---|---|---  \nHumble Choice| Gaming| 12  \nDropbox| Cloud storage| 11  \nAmazon Prime (Shopping)| Delivery| 11  \nAmazon Prime (Gaming)| Gaming| 11  \nAmazon Prime (Video)| Streaming| 11  \nIDrive| Cloud storage| 9  \nMicrosoft OneDrive| Cloud storage| 9  \nEA Play| Gaming| 9  \nXBOX Game Pass Ultimate| Gaming| 9  \nTidal| Music| 9  \nHBO Max| Streaming| 9  \nNBC Peacock| Streaming| 9  \nInstacart+| Delivery| 8  \nAmazon Music| Music| 8  \nQobuz| Music| 8  \n  \n## Number of clicks to unsubscribe\n\nAs part of our research, we also looked into how many clicks it took to\nunsubscribe from each platform. On average it takes around 7 steps\n(clicks/taps) to get from the homepage to then successfully cancel a\nsubscription. When you factor in the number of platforms using copywriting\ntricks and web/app design features to make it challenging, those 7 steps could\ninvolve a hurdle at every click.\n\nIn our research, the cloud storage solution MEGA, had the most clicks (11) to\nunsubscribe, followed by Google Drive and Humble Choice at 10 each.\n\nAn example of how a subscription cancellation can encourage users to stay by\nsetting up a reminder of wanting to cancel in the future rather than canceling\nthere and then, adding another step to the process of leaving.\n\nWhen we look at what consumers actually want, 38.9% of our survey respondents\nsaid they would prefer one button in their account labeled \u2018Cancel' to stop\ntheir subscription, with the next most popular option to cancel being one\nemail to customer service (19.1%). Another 19% would prefer to speak to\nsomeone on a phone call, a further 14.5% would prefer live chat, and the\nminority (8.4%) said they would engage well with video calls to customer\nservice.\n\nThe most popular option of one button in their account, would require at most\n3 clicks, from the homepage clicking the account then clicking cancel and\nconfirming, which is in contrast to the 7 steps on average.\n\n### Subscription services that require the most clicks to cancel\n\nCategory| Subscription| Clicks to unsubscribe  \n---|---|---  \nCloud storage| MEGA| 11  \nCloud storage| Google Drive| 10  \nGaming| Humble choice| 10  \nCloud storage| Dropbox| 9  \nGaming| Google Play pass| 9  \nDelivery| Instacart+| 8  \nGaming| xBox Game Pass ultimate| 8  \nStreaming| Hulu| 8  \n  \n## Dark patterns harming grieving families\n\nAmong the countless emotional and difficult processes for loved ones after the\ndeath of someone close to them, canceling their online subscriptions should be\npainless. However, the responses to our survey are surprising, and show that\nan overwhelming majority of customers have faced challenges in closing a\ndeceased relative\u2019s account and dark patterns will play a part in this.\n\nWe asked whether people felt a company had made it difficult to cancel a loved\none's account after they had passed, and 91% of participants agreed. To make\nmatters worse, 88% of respondents answered \u2018yes\u2019 to the question \u201cDid the\ncompany take any money or charge for the period of time since the person\npassed away until it was canceled?\u201d.\n\nAlmost two in three (65%) continued to pay for subscriptions for three months\nafter a loved one passed away.\n\nOur survey also found that almost two-thirds of respondents (65%) continued to\npay for services for three months or more after a loved one\u2019s death. With\nconsumers spending a reported average of $219 on monthly subscriptions,\nleaving these running could become very expensive for grieving families.\n\nWhile major brands have established processes to drive revenue and retention\nfor their subscription platforms, profiteering from paid accounts of the\ndeceased could be seen as poor form by many customers.\n\n## Methodology\n\nDark patterns research methodology\n\nUSA Today found that gaming, cloud storage, retail delivery services, TV/movie\nstreaming, and music were the most popular subscription services in the U.S.\nWe then built a list from these five categories of the most popular services\nand manually analyzed each when unsubscribing, looking for dark patterns.\nSubscription services were chosen based on reports online for the \u2018best\u2019\nsubscription services for Americans in each category.\n\n  * Connectbit \u2013 Most used cloud storage by user numbers\n  * Statista \u2013 Biggest streaming platforms\n  * Business of Apps \u2013 Most used music streaming services\n  * CNET \u2013 Best gaming subscription services\n  * IRI Subscription Services \u2013 Top retail subscription services among US consumers\n\nThe list of dark patterns our researchers used was created from various pieces\nof research into the topic online, such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC),\nPrinceton University, ecommerce vendor Shopify, and the Deceptive Patterns\n(formerly Dark Patterns) organization.\n\nNew accounts were created for each of the subscriptions and services were used\nfor a number of weeks before unsubscribing.\n\nSurvey methodology\n\nWe surveyed 1,035 American adults who have used subscription services in the\nlast 12 months, asking them questions about dark patterns and the process of\ncanceling subscriptions.\n\nOur respondents identified as:\n\n  * Female 41.35%\n  * Male 57.78%\n  * Non-binary 0.68%\n  * Other/Chose not to identify 0.2%\n\nAge:\n\n  * 18-24 3.00%\n  * 25-34 53.43%\n  * 35-44 25.99%\n  * 45-54 10.72%\n  * 55-64 4.25%\n  * 65 and over 2.61%\n\n## The authors\n\nLearn more about us\n\n### Cai Ellis\n\nSEO Manager\n\nHi!
