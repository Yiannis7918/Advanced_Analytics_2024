Now\nspun off from Omidyar\u2019s First Look Media, The Intercept is losing roughly\n$300,000 a month, is on track to have a balance of less than a million dollars\nby November \u2014 and could be completely out of cash by May 2025, according to\ndata shared internally in March.\n\nThe Intercept\u2019s CEO, Annie Chabel, told Semafor in an interview this week that\nthose projections were a worst-case scenario, and that the Intercept had a\n\u201cstretch revenue goal that would allow us to continue into a longer horizon.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Intercept was born a decade ago in a very different moment for media and\npolitics. Two of its founders, Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras, broke the\nstory of Edward Snowden\u2019s leaked surveillance files in 2013, which reshaped\nhow Americans thought about the government and their privacy. Omidyar, a\nleftish billionaire with no known appetite for political combat, rapidly\npledged deep support for an organization that would combine that anti-\nestablishment mission with a combative form of online journalism born out of\nGawker Media.\n\nA decade later, American politics are almost unrecognizable. Greenwald quit in\nfury to make quixotic allies on the right. Liberal donors have lost their\ntaste for party infighting as the specter of Donald Trump looms, while voices\nfurther left are promising to punish Joe Biden over his response to Gaza.\n\nThose factors frame a crisis that comes even as the organization is riding\nhigh among its readers for its aggressively pro-Palestnian coverage. The\nIntercept has broken stories about American diplomatic cables warning of a\n\u201ccatastrophic\u201d Israeli invasion of Rafah, infighting in the philanthropic\nworld, and tensions on campuses, in art galleries, and inside US newsrooms\nover the war in Gaza. It has picked fights with The New York Times and become\na home for harshly anti-Israel voices rarely seen in U.S. media.\n\nAD\n\nBut tensions between the outlet\u2019s star reporters, its founders, and its four-\nperson nonprofit board are threatening to unravel it.\n\nIn this article:\n\n### The Scoop\n\n### Know More\n\n### Max\u2019s view\n\n### Room for Disagreement\n\n### Know More\n\nMany of the Intercept\u2019s journalists direct their ire at Chabel, a longtime\nnonprofit executive.\n\nChabel joined the Intercept at a transition moment for the organization. In\n2022, First Look Media had offered a $12 million grant to help the publication\nspin off \u2014 about half of what Intercept leaders had asked for. The\npublication\u2019s editor-in-chief, Roger D. Hodge, said he told the organization\u2019s\nboard that he did not believe the grant was enough, and they should wind down\nthe Intercept and give staff as generous a severance package as possible.\nChabel, who had initially joined the organization as a consultant to manage\nexpenses and oversee the spinoff, helped convince First Look Media to up its\ngrant to $14 million, and presented what appeared to be a financial path\nforward for the organization.\n\nAD\n\nWhen staffers convened in October last year for a meeting at the\norganization\u2019s New York offices, its leadership had what staff interpreted as\ngood news. Now the organization\u2019s CEO, Chabel was overseeing the new financial\nsupport model, which would rely on both small-dollar donors and major gifts\nfrom philanthropic individuals and organizations. While she wouldn\u2019t commit\nduring the meeting to not laying off staff in the future, Chabel told\nemployees that the organization was stable and appeared to be on target to\nmeet its fundraising goals.\n\nEditorially, world events had reinvigorated The Intercept and given it renewed\npurpose. The progressive publication\u2019s disdain of Israeli military action and\nsympathy for the Palestinians distinguished it early in the Gaza war from many\nmajor American news outlets. And its distance from the Democratic\nestablishment helped it break a number of stories about the rift within media\norganizations, liberal politics, and the art world over both U.S. domestic\nissues and Israel\u2019s military operations in Gaza. That coverage resonated with\nits core audience of readers and supporters: The Intercept\u2019s membership team\nboasted to staff that it had exceeded some of its targets in the months\nfollowing Oct. 7.\n\nBut while the scoops yielded small-dollar donations, the organization\u2019s\nleadership struggled to find the big money needed to keep it operating.\nPrivately, executives acknowledged that while philanthropic donations had\ndoubled between 2022 and 2023, from $488,000 to $867,000, they still had\nfallen short. In February, the publication laid off 30% of its editorial\nstaff.\n\nIt also fired Hodge. The relationship between the then-EIC and Chabel had been\ndeteriorating for months, after Hodge told Chabel that he would not lay off\nany more staff. Two sources told Semafor she was also frustrated by his lack\nof enthusiasm for working more closely with the business side. Chabel raised\nher concerns to the organization\u2019s board of directors, to whom Hodge reported\ndirectly, and the board voted unanimously to oust him.\n\nHodge\u2019s ouster and the increasingly troubled financial picture also created an\neditorial power vacuum. After the board fired Hodge, Chabel received approval\nto restructure the organization, requiring a new editor-in-chief to report up\nto the CEO, rather than directly to the board. She then asked deputy editor\nNausicaa Renner and senior news editor Ali Gharib to serve as interim co-\neditors-in-chief while they searched for a new top editor. Both declined, and\nRenner resigned.\n\nIn a statement to Semafor, Renner said that she found the editorial\nrestructuring \u201cdisturbing,\u201d arguing that Chabel\u2019s leadership had altered the\ncoverage and threatened editorial independence.\n\n\u201cEditorial hires and priorities should not be determined by the CEO,\u201d she said\nof Chabel. \u201cNo matter what her politics are as an individual, the effect of\nher cuts and leadership is to quiet an outspoken outlet on Gaza.\u201d\n\nThe site\u2019s veteran journalists offered an interim path forward. Several\nstaffers proposed that a four-person committee be formed to run the\npublication\u2019s editorial side while it searched for a new top editor: Gharib,\nco-founder Jeremy Scahill, Washington, D.C. bureau chief Ryan Grim, and editor\nMaryam Saleh. The board rejected the idea.\n\nIn March, Chabel announced to staff in an email that it had been approached by\nseveral unnamed employees who put forward a proposal for \u201ca transfer of the\nintellectual property of The Intercept to a new entity.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are engaging with it seriously,\u201d Chabel wrote.\n\nThe email confused and alarmed staff, prompting Grim to respond with a\nclarification. He and co-founder Jeremy Scahill had suggested that the four-\nperson board of directors resign, turning the operation over to the duo and\nremaining staff.\n\n\u201cOur motivation is firmly rooted in a deep commitment to sustaining the work\nof a media outlet that has served for more than a decade as a vital source of\nhard hitting journalism and an unwavering dedication to holding the powerful\nto account,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBut the board wasn\u2019t swayed by this idea, either. In an email several days\nlater, Grim said that he\u2019d been \u201cinformed by the board that our proposal has\nbeen declined.\u201d\n\nSome of the internal battles have spilled into public view. In March, The\nIntercept\u2019s editorial union released a statement excoriating leadership for\nits fundraising efforts. Chabel \u201chad one job to do, and she failed,\u201d the unit\nsaid.\n\nThose tensions have run even higher internally. During a meeting earlier this\nyear, Scahill exploded at Chabel, saying she should resign. Other recent\ndecisions by the organization\u2019s leadership have irked remaining staff. As\nSemafor first reported, during an all staff meeting on Thursday the\npublication told employees that it had hired former Los Angeles Times\nassistant managing editor Ben Muessig to be the interim editor-in-chief \u2014 who,\naccording to multiple sources familiar with the selection process, was not\nemployees\u2019 first choice.\n\nAnd there is little internal consensus on how to move forward. Grim and\nScahill are two of the outlet\u2019s longest-serving figures, with Grim leading\nhigh-profile coverage and Scahill helming its podcast. But their plan would\ninevitably involve deep cuts and layoffs. (Other staffers pointed out to\nSemafor that, on the current trajectory, they\u2019ll likely all lose their jobs\nanyway.)\n\nSome of Chabel\u2019s allies, meanwhile, blame Hodge for the current mess, saying\nthe publication missed an opportunity to align the newsroom with the\nnonprofit\u2019s fundraising imperatives. Hodge told Semafor he found that\nsentiment confusing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s simply not true that I resisted working with the fundraising operation,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cI spent untold hours talking to them about the journalism and\nwriting memos and have been helping to brainstorm how they could describe the\nwork we\u2019re doing. I spent way more time doing that than editing pieces.\u201d\n\n### Max\u2019s view\n\nThe Intercept\u2019s mission is clearer now than it has been since the 2020\nDemocratic primaries, in which the publication aggressively attacked moderate\nDemocrats from the left with election-shaping scoops. That string of stories\nterrified (or at least annoyed) centrist Democrats, and helped shape the\npublication\u2019s image as the most overtly progressive and leftist national news\noutlet that consistently broke news. Now, The Intercept\u2019s unapologetically\nhostile view of Israel\u2019s post-Oct. 7 military operation in Gaza has galvanized\nits readers and supporters, who have responded by helping the publication set\ninternal records for small-dollar donations.\n\nBut the notion that a radical, anti-establishment newsroom was going to rake\nin big checks from liberal American donors now seems fanciful. The Intercept\nburnished its reputation on the left by aggressively reporting on big-money\nliberal donors who backed more moderate candidates. These same figures are\noften major players in the philanthropic space, and of course have balked at\ndonating.\n\n### Room for Disagreement\n\nChabel acknowledged that while \u201cit\u2019s not a surprise that there are some\ntraditional funders who are not going to be interested in our particular brand\nof journalism,\u201d she believes it takes time for any nonprofit to find major\ndonors. The Intercept, she said, occupies a \u201cunique place\u201d in the news\nlandscape that can still appeal to certain major funders, even if they don\u2019t\nagree with everything it publishes.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of donors care about who is in power and the power is\nquestioned, regardless of whether it\u2019s left or right,\u201d she said.\n\nAD\n\n", "frontpage": true}
