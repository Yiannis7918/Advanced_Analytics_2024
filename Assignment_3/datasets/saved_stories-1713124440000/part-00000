I did not give anyone\npermission to do this, yet it\u2019s now sitting at the top of the charts (despite\nbeing filled with ads + tracking)\n\nI\u2019ve bit my tongue a bunch in the past month...but this really frustrates me.\nSo glad App Review exists to protect consumers from scams and rip-offs like\nthis\n\nApr 14, 2024, 07:33 AM\u00b7\u00b7Ivory for iOS\n\n112boosts\u00b7191favorites\n\n7h\n\nRiley Testut @rileytestut\n\nTo be clear, I\u2019m not pissed at the developer.\n\nI\u2019m pissed that Apple took the time to change the App Store rules to allow\nemulators, and then approved a knock-off of my own app \u2014 even though I\u2019ve been\nready to launch @altstore with Delta *since March 5*\n\n6h\n\n\u6016\u3044\u30eb\u30d3\u30fc @ruby@tenforward.social\n\n@rileytestut @altstore sorry that happened. Is altstore only coming through\nofficial channels to EU people? Everything has been so crazy lately with\napple\u2019s policy updates so hoping I missed something that means I can stop\nrefreshing apps every 7 days here in the US.\n\n6h\n\nfritzlb @fritzlb\n\n@rileytestut @altstore seems like apple screwed you over, just like every\ndeveloper in the EU with that CTF. Also seems like Apple wants to make the\nlife of anyone wanting to establish an alternative store as hard as possible,\nwho could've thought\n\n6h\n\ncliophate @cliophate@overkill.social\n\n@rileytestut @altstore what\u2019s missing so that you can launch?\n\n6h\n\njoe kimberlin @Joekw\n\n@cliophate @rileytestut @altstore can't you guess\n\n6h\n\ncliophate @cliophate@overkill.social\n\n@Joekw @rileytestut @altstore yeah, Apple\u2019s go, but what\u2019s their argument?\nSimply ignoring it? Or are we missing like an iOS update that enables the\nfeature in the first place?\n\n2h\n\nDominic @dominicwrege@social.linux.pizza\n\n@cliophate @Joekw @rileytestut @altstore https://apps.apple.com/de/app/my-boy-\ngba-emulator/id6477892610?l=en-GB\n\nApp StoreMy Boy! - GBA EmulatorYou control a boy by giving them commands to\nmove in certain places, attack enemy creatures, and build houses and other\nstructures.\n\n1h\n\nQuarterSwede @quarterswede@noc.social\n\n@dominicwrege @cliophate @Joekw @rileytestut @altstore Hahaha. That\u2019s almost\namazing in its inaccuracy.\n\n6h\n\nGraphiar @Graphine\n\n@rileytestut @altstore I mean, don\u2019t get me wrong. I understand the\nfrustration and it\u2019s blatantly scummy of Apple to do this considering it\u2019s a\nflat out knockoff. (I downloaded it to see and it\u2019s insane. It feels shady\njust opening it).\n\nBut, why not submit Delta to the App Store?? You\u2019ve been asked this a million\ntimes and haven\u2019t confirmed as to why. I understand why it\u2019s on AltStore but\nit\u2019s for EU users only. Have you not considered submitting this to the App\nStore at all?\n\n6h\n\nGraphiar @Graphine\n\n@rileytestut @altstore All and all you could probably solve this temporarily\nby submitting Delta to the App Store. That way non EU users aren\u2019t left in the\ndust and frankly given how many more platforms it supports you could probably\novershadow that shitty knockoff. It\u2019s scummy how it\u2019s lingering at top 10.\n\n5h\n\nTanner B @objc\n\n@rileytestut @altstore\n\nWhy are you surprised? This is standard App Store behavior. Never gonna stop,\neither\n\nAlso, do you have plans to launch Delta in the US?\n\n5h\n\nk\u0394 @kDelta@techhub.social\n\n@rileytestut @altstore Sorry do you expect Apple to send investigators around\nto raid every developers property prior to approval to ensure zero copyrighted\ninfringement? Report it if your code has been stolen. Take legal action\nagainst the \u201cdeveloper\u201d.\n\n3h *\n\neduo @eduo\n\n@rileytestut @altstore You should be pissed at the guy that released this.\nYour license clearly says this can't be done.\n\nIt\u2019s sad that this happening was a given, with so many emulators being open\nsource and so many people with not enough scruples.\n\nWondering what Apple will say. What their position will be with open source\n(where licensing has always been a point of discussion)\n\n1h\n\nChancerubbage @Chancerubbage\n\n@rileytestut @altstore\n\nRegardless of intent it happens constantly, lone devs being ripped off by\ncontent mills.\n\nI wish there was a way in the App Store beyond \u2018reviews\u2019 to warn others\ndownloading.\n\n31m\n\nMachiel @vmachiel@mastodon.nl\n\n@rileytestut @altstore @stroughtonsmith question: you\u2019re going altstore only?\n\n6h\n\nDavid Kocher @davidkocher@swiss.social\n\n@rileytestut Apple doesn\u2019t miss out a single chance to showcase their closed\nsystem depending on manual review is fundamentally broken. Whether bad intent\nor not, the result is the same.\n\n4h\n\nmariken @mrkn\n\n@rileytestut @delta Just another example of how Apple\u2019s portrayal of the App\nStore doesn\u2019t match reality. If the App Store hadn\u2019t gotten this bad over the\nyears, I probably would not be as enthusiastic about the legal efforts to\nbreak their monopoly.\n\n3h\n\nJeff @JPZ\n\n@rileytestut @delta This is a perfect example of how App Review totally just\nsucks. You\u2019ve been THEE proponent FOR Alt App Stores, let alone Emulator apps,\nand to approve a knock off of your app before you\u2019re even approved to have an\nAlt App Store is completely and utterly 70\u2019s bad sitcom funny. We all saw it\ncoming, and hopefully there\u2019s at least one publication that will write up more\nabout it.\n\n2h\n\nJared Nay @jarednay\n\n@rileytestut @delta it\u2019s sitting at the top of the charts in... Developer?\nThis App approval process is more sus every day. You have the right to be\npissed. Shame Apple seems to have removed the ability to report a problem.\n\n2h\n\nK\u00fcgl\u00e1 @koogalah\n\n@rileytestut @delta I thought they changed it for EU only, but that app is\navailable in the US. Probably won\u2019t be long before it\u2019s taken down.\n\n1h\n\nQuarterSwede @quarterswede@noc.social\n\n@koogalah @rileytestut @delta You\u2019ll be forgiven for thinking the change to\nallow emulators was EU only. It\u2019s not, it\u2019s worldwide for some reason.\n\n12m\n\nmingistech @mingistech@toot.community\n\n@koogalah @rileytestut @delta No, ban on emulations was lifted world wide.\n\n2h\n\nCraig Grannell @craiggrannell\n\n@rileytestut @delta Would be very interesting now to see what would happen if\nyou submitted Delta to the App Store.\n\n2h\n\nRadu Ursache @radu@toots.ro\n\n@rileytestut just launch your official apps then? what are you waiting for?\n\n1h\n\nChancerubbage @Chancerubbage\n\n@radu @rileytestut\n\nI imagine an alt App Store could point to \u2018rom rips\u2019 and \u2018original games\u2019\nneeded to make an emulator work.\n\nI haven\u2019t played with them much since the days of the PlayStation disk\nemulator with cd rom drives 25 yrs ago\n\nI never played a Rom rip I didn\u2019t already own because:\n\nI only knew and wanted games I was familiar with through ownership. And\nEmulators weren\u2019t always up to snuff, or were moving targets if constant\nupdates\n\n1h\n\nJosh Z @joshzepeda\n\n@rileytestut @delta I mean, you could always upload Delta to the App Store and\nI\u2019ll happily pay for it, but since that\u2019s not the case, I don\u2019t see what other\nchoice we have as non-EU residents other than side loading.\n\nI\u2019m hoping the fact that this knockoff version of your app got approved can\nbring change in your way of approaching things.\n\n1h\n\nmako @mako@sanjuans.life\n\n@rileytestut @delta can you release Delta now in the Apple Store?\n\n1h\n\nLuana @luana@tech.lgbt\n\n@delta @rileytestut I don\u2019t see any licenses allowing this on GBA4iOS (it\ndoesn\u2019t seem to be open source?) so probably report it or something\n\nHowever, I see nothing stopping them from doing this with Delta since the\nlicense states people can distribute wherever they want\n\n1h\n\nLuana @luana@tech.lgbt\n\n@rileytestut @delta Also, now that App Store allows emulators (had no idea\nthat was the case now - but also some emulators were already published so I\nguess their compliance to this was kinda weird?) can\u2019t you just publish Delta\nin there before someone else does it?\n\n39m\n\nMike Rockwell @mike@libertynode.net\n\n@rileytestut I didn\u2019t realize it was a knockoff. But its approval does\nindicate that Delta would be approved if submitted. Do you have any plans to\ndo so? Or are you just planning to go the alternative app market place route\nwith AltStore?\n\nExploreLive feeds\n\nLogin to follow profiles or hashtags, favorite, share and reply to posts.
