Kelly\u2019s exploratory\nspirit has led him down multiple paths of expression, each impactful in its\nown way. But his pursuits are all unified by a relentless engagement with the\npotential of new tools to reshape our lives and society at large.\n\nIt all began when Kelly encountered the Whole Earth Catalog as an\nimpressionable teenager somewhere around the turn of the 1970s. Launched by\nStewart Brand through the nonprofit Portola Institute out of Menlo Park in\n1968 and released in various editions throughout the 70s, the Catalog rode a\ncresting wave of California counterculture to provide readers with \u201caccess to\ntools\u201d and information outside of traditional, mainstream thought systems. It\nwas at once a nostalgic throwback to American mail orders from Sears and a\nwholesale reinvention of the form for the hippie heyday, encompassing product\nreviews, tips, suggestions, how-to guides, and brief commentary on everything\nfrom cybernetics and engineering design to auto repair and creative\nglassblowing.\n\nSourcing selections in part from subscribers, the Catalog championed self-\nsufficiency, educational autonomy, and holistic self-improvement in a manner\nthat anticipated what Kelly has referred to as the \u201cinformed enthusiasm\u201d of\nmodern blogging\u2014and with a techno-optimism tempered by a pastoral bent. It was\na dispatch on how things were, with the foresight to imagine what they could\nbe.\n\nAbove all, the Catalog was a galvanizing instruction manual for marching to\nthe beat of your own drum, and Kelly dutifully listened. Following its ethos\nof self-reliance and lifelong learning, Kelly dropped out of his first and\nonly year of college in 1971 and led a nomadic lifestyle for an extended\nperiod, wandering around Asia as a freelance photographer and travel writer.\nAfter having a conversion experience while sleeping on the supposed spot of\nJesus\u2019 crucifixion in 1979, he returned home to temporarily live with his\nparents, then worked in a biology lab at the University of Georgia.\nEventually, he connected with Brand online, through the nascent Electronic\nInformation Exchange System. In 1984, Brand enlisted Kelly to edit the final\nissue of his CoEvolution Quarterly journal, which merged with another Catalog\nspin-off in 1985 to become the Whole Earth Review, with a renewed emphasis on\nsoftware and computer tech.\n\n> As a Web1 pioneer and a Web2 critic and optimist, he now espouses an ideal\n> of \u201cprotopia\u201d\u2014not dystopia or utopia, but a society grounded in a belief in\n> incremental progress engendered by more, and better, technology.\n\nKelly\u2019s vision for the Review, where he was publisher and editor from 1984 to\n1990, was shaped in large part by an earlier revelatory encounter he had with\nthe Apple IIe personal computer. The machine made him keenly aware of\ntechnology\u2019s power to bring together communities of geographically distant,\ndisparate individuals, united by shared interests\u2014not dissimilar to his\nexperience with the Catalog. He became convinced that the next continent to\nexplore was the fragmented, immaterial realm of information, which became a\nkey framework for his next decade of activity.\n\nIn 1984, Kelly helped present the first Hackers Conference, bringing together\nfor the first time some of the iconoclastic programmers and developers\nfeatured in Steven Levy\u2019s book Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution\n(1984). The following year, he contributed to the launch of yet another\nCatalog offshoot called the WELL, or Whole Earth \u2019Lectronic Link\u2014an online\ngathering place for Whole Earth readers and others, considered to be one of\nthe internet\u2019s earliest forum communities. And in 1988, Kelly spearheaded the\nbuild and release of the Electronic Whole Earth Catalog, a CD-ROM version of\nthe publication. It was financed by Catalog acolyte Steve Jobs and used\nApple\u2019s HyperCard software to reformat the Catalog as 9,000 cards connected\nvia hypertext.\n\nAfter publishing additional Catalog titles throughout the late 1980s, Kelly\nteamed up with journalist-entrepreneurs Louis Rossetto and Jane Metcalfe in\n1993 to start a new magazine called WIRED. He would hold the title of\nexecutive editor for the next seven years, integrating the Catalog\u2019s\ncontrarian spirit with the idea of creating a platform where journalists and\nprognosticators could consider and critique the burgeoning digital forces\naffecting life on Earth. In 1994, he published what would be the first of\nseveral books combining technological analysis and philosophy, Out of Control:\nThe New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World. Its\nmeditations on the complexities of modern industrial economies proved\nprescient\u2014and if Keanu Reeves is to be believed, were required reading for all\nactors in The Matrix. (Kelly would have a similar dalliance with Hollywood in\nthe early 2000s, as a futurism consultant for Steven Spielberg\u2019s Minority\nReport (2002).)\n\nToday, at 70, Kelly remains on WIRED\u2019s masthead as \u201csenior maverick.\u201d As a\nWeb1 pioneer and a Web2 critic and optimist, he now espouses an ideal of\n\u201cprotopia\u201d\u2014not dystopia or utopia, but a society grounded in a belief in\nincremental progress engendered by more, and better, technology. To that end,\nhe currently works as a board member, alongside luminaries like Brian Eno of\nthe Long Now Foundation, which aims to encourage long-term thinking through\nprojects like a monumental clock in the Colorado mountains, meant to keep time\nfor the next 10,000 years. He also continues the lineage of the Catalog with\nCool Tools, an email newsletter/blog/book hybrid he launched in 2003. His own\nrecent recommendations include black caulk, a large apple slicer, and\n\u201calternative worlds\u201d\u2014a mix of the utilitarian and the imaginative, the magical\nand the mundane.\n\nSo what can we learn from Kelly? How do we absorb his endless enthusiasm for\nand negotiation with new tools while tending to our inner and outer landscapes\nbefore they become overplanted, too dense to navigate or decipher? In this\ninterview with Zine\u2019s own Yana Sosnovskaya, Kelly took us on an invigorating\nstroll through the verdant forest of his eternally curious mind, discussing\ntopics such as DAOs as an ideological experiment, toxic anonymity, and his\nview of the blockchain-based world of Web3, which he likens to a high school\ngraduate still figuring out their place in life.\u2014Aaron Gonsher\n\nYana Sosnovskaya: In your book Out of Control, when you share your first\nexperience with the personal computer, you say that it was an almost religious\nexperience. Why was that moment so significant for you?\n\nKevin Kelly: I had seen computers before in the late 1960s. My father, who was\ninvolved with computers to some extent, took me to a trade show in Atlantic\nCity, and I was very unimpressed by the computers then. They were boring\nbecause they were these very big cabinets and there were no screens. I ignored\nthem until I met the personal computer, which was an Apple IIe, in the\nlaboratory of the scientist I worked for.\n\nThe entire revelation came when we hooked the Apple IIe up to the telephone:\nthere were things called modems, where you took the handset from the phone,\nand you put it in this cradle. It would make an audible noise of it\nconnecting, and that was when everything changed. It was when it was a\ncommunication device primarily. Late at night, whenever everyone else was gone\nand the computer was free, I began to log into these numbers that were being\npassed around; there was this emerging culture of bulletin boards, they were\ncalled, often a computer that was run in somebody\u2019s bedroom, and that would\nallow people to call in. Only one person at a time could be in the bulletin\nboard: you\u2019d leave a message and then exit, and someone else would come in and\nread it. While they were there, they occupied your phone line, and you got a\nbusy signal. It was very, very primitive.\n\nBut I had this glimmer of this world opening up, this territory that was now\naccessible, and it was like a big \u201caha.\u201d It\u2019s this new world. I decided to\nwrite about it as if it was a new world, because I was a travel writer at the\ntime, and I decided that I would cover this as if it was a new continent, a\nnew nation, a new country. So I had permission to explore all the different\nbulletin boards, but they weren\u2019t connected together\u2014this wasn\u2019t the internet\nyet. It was very nerdy. Most people dismissed it in the way that you might\ndismiss people who are interested in crypto today. I couldn\u2019t foresee that\neverybody would be talking about it all the time, but I certainly could see\nthat it was going to be a major thing.\n\n> It (Whole Earth Catalog) covered my interests of science and art and\n> everything in between and I desperately wanted to contribute to it, but I\n> absolutely knew nothing.\n\nYS: What was it about the philosophy or ideology of the Whole Earth Catalog\nthat shifted your perception? What was attractive and appealing about it at\nthe time?\n\nKK: The Whole Earth Catalog was this amateur, independently produced\npublication printing a lot of niche information that was impossible to find\nanywhere. They were based in California and self-publishing this book that, if\nyou read some of the longer pieces today, you would recognize as a blog. They\nwere using technology that was very innovative to produce a do-it-yourself\nguide: how to build your own house, how to do homeschooling, how to do design,\nhow to be interested in religion, how to do drugs.\n\nIt was all about providing users with choices and possibilities about things\nthat they had no idea about and giving them some entryway into it. It was a\nuser-generated publication in the sense that a lot of it was being written by\nthe users coming in. There was no advertising. You had to subscribe to it.\nThat made it very democratic. It anticipated a lot of the ethos and the\natmosphere that the internet later on had. It covered my interests of science\nand art and everything in between and I desperately wanted to contribute to\nit, but I absolutely knew nothing. I had no expertise. I had no insight. I was\na high school kid in New Jersey.\n\nAfter traveling around for a decade, I realized I had something to offer: I\nknew more about budget travel than anybody. I later worked at Whole Earth and\nthen I edited it and then I published it. What we were doing with WIRED and\nwhat I do with Cool Tools now is an extension of that.\n\nYS: Web3 communities,the communities operating on the blockchain, have an\nalmost cultish attitude towards Whole Earth.\n\nKK: Oh really?\n\nYS: I was curious if you were aware of that. And if not, why do you think that\ncould be?\n\nKK: I wasn\u2019t aware that there was much of an appreciation for Whole Earth. I\u2019m\nglad to hear that. I think Web3 sees themselves as counterculture. Whole Earth\nwas counterculture and it preached a kind of Walden \u201cmarch to your own drum.\u201d\nThere is some aspect of that in Web3\u2014really feeling that they are outside the\northodoxy, which they are. But I will say that the Whole Earth Catalog was not\na huge fan of communes, and that\u2019s probably because Stewart [Brand] had tried\nto live on a commune and became very disgruntled with it. I didn\u2019t have any\nreal direct contact but I was always kind of suspicious of them, but I think\nthe Catalog in itself was not; it was sold and made a huge amount of money\nfrom communes buying it. So it wasn\u2019t anti-commune, but it really wasn\u2019t in\nfavor, either. Everybody was paid the same amount of money, which was\ninteresting. All the employees, including me, when I was even publishing it,\nwe all made 10 dollars an hour.\n\n1 of 7\n\nYS: Do you see a gravitation towards communes and communal thinking in Web3?\n\nKK: I see it in some of the DAOs. The theory of the DAO is that people have a\nstake in the direction and the governance, a more democratic or decentralized\ngovernance. That\u2019s communal in a certain sense. Part of the problem with\ncommunes is that it\u2019s really hard to govern anything without a hierarchy of\nany sort. People eventually left communes because of that issue.\n\nThat\u2019s my advice to anybody who is interested in starting a DAO: be a\ncooperative first. And then, if you survive that, live in a commune and see\nthe difficulties of actually getting things done. There\u2019s not an equal amount\nof enthusiasm for governance. There\u2019s a natural hierarchy or a natural\nvariance in people\u2019s interests. I think I\u2019m interested in DAOs as an\nideological experiment trying to uncover other models of governance.\n\nYS: 2021 was called the Summer of DAO because of this huge wave of excitement\naround them. For people of younger generations who hadn\u2019t experienced communes\nand communal living, it was a novel idea. They are now experiencing problems\nlike what you\u2019re saying about voting fatigue, etc.\n\nYou position yourself as an optimist in certain interviews. You were\noptimistic about the technology. Coming back to this notion of optimism today\nafter Web2, centralized technology, the pandemic, wars\u2014how do you feel about\noptimism in technology right now?\n\nKK: I am more optimistic than ever before. Not because I think our problems\nare smaller or fewer, but because I think our capacity to solve them is\nbigger. Our ability to learn things, to figure out things, to create solutions\nhas been accelerated by things like YouTube and the communication technologies\nthat we have today. Smartphones\u2014everybody, everywhere\u2014that is huge.\n\nThe continued advance movement to solar and electric vehicles is just\nfantastic and will continue to accelerate. We now have a duty to be optimistic\nas we imagine a future. It\u2019s difficult to imagine a high-tech world full of AI\nand genetic engineering and surveillance that we want to live in, but if we\ncan imagine a way in which it works for the better, then we can aim towards\nthat. I think we should strive to imagine a future full of all this technology\nthat works.\n\nYS: What role do you think blockchain can play in that?\n\nKK: Blockchain is being tried on lots of different problems. And as they\u2019re\nbeing applied, we see the cost and downside. It feels to me as if it\u2019s a\ntechnology looking for the right job. It reminds me of a high school graduate\nwho\u2019s very talented and odd, and they are trying to figure out where their\nplace is.\n\nMy feeling is that blockchain is going to be most useful when you have no idea\nthat it\u2019s there. It\u2019s like plumbing. It\u2019s not going to be sexy when it works.\nIt\u2019s going to be very, very boring. Like encryption. We\u2019ve had encryption for\nyears and years, and most of it happens way beyond, and we\u2019re not aware of it.\nAnd the fact that we\u2019re not aware of it is why it works.\n\n> The blockchain could be useful in harmonizing trust, harmonizing\n> interoperability, harmonizing authentication and all these other issues that\n> would need addressing in a decentralized world.\n\nYS: Is there any application of a blockchain that excites you that you don\u2019t\nsee society or even Web3 communities talking about enough?\n\nKK: There are two places where I think blockchain could work in the future.\nOne is that it could help create the metaverse we want, which is a very\ndecentralized interoperable place with many millions of people contributing to\nit. It\u2019s not controlled by one thing. And if the metaverse, the mirrorworld is\nwhat I call it, has digital versions of everything, you might want some way to\nauthenticate things, to verify that they\u2019re not a spam hydrant or a mailbox\nthat is actually unauthorized or unofficial or whatever. I could imagine that\nthe idea of authenticating, legitimizing, making official, and making clear\nownership in the digital mirrorworld would be a role for blockchain.\n\nThe second use for blockchain is tokenization\u2014that everything is tokenized and\nyou have monetary value added to everything. I can imagine that as another\nlevel in the metaverse or mirrorworld, where tokenization permits allotting of\nresources. It also allows for a real-time accounting thing, which we don\u2019t\nhave. Big businesses do not yet have real-time accounting. They have batch\nmode. The blockchain might have a role in that.\n\nOnce you have something like the metaverse where you go across boundaries, you\nhave different regimes. The blockchain could be useful in harmonizing trust,\nharmonizing interoperability, harmonizing authentication and all these other\nissues that would need addressing in a decentralized world.\n\nYS: There are a lot of anonymous identities and anonymous people in Web3. When\nyou\u2019re talking about authentication and identification, what do you think\nabout the future of anonymity? Is it sustainable?\n\nKK: High levels of anonymity are toxic, and that is actually something\nhindering Web3. It breeds distrust. It allows the worst of human behavior to\nflourish. I think pseudonyms are even better than just pure anonymity. I would\nbe willing to bet that systems that have large amounts of anonymity don\u2019t\nprosper over time. They\u2019re just not places that most people want to hang out.\n\nYS: What do you forecast for the future of crypto and blockchain in terms of\nthe relationship with the governments and legislation in 10 years?\n\nKK: I\u2019ve long predicted that some of the biggest cryptocurrencies will be\ngovernment-mandated because everything is transparent. You can certainly\nimagine China having cryptocurrency where they don\u2019t allow anonymity and every\ntransaction is on the public ledger. I don\u2019t think Bitcoin\u2019s going to go away.\nI think there\u2019ll be anonymous coins forever. But I don\u2019t suspect that there\u2019s\ngoing to be a very large percentage of all this because there\u2019s low trust.\nThere\u2019s discursion because of the uncertainty of who people are, and\nbusinesses don\u2019t like uncertainty. These negatives will keep it from becoming\nthe dominant currency, even though it will never go away.\n\n1 of 5\n\nYS: Do you think the government would ever be open to embracing the idea of\ndecentralized identification in voting systems?\n\nKK: There\u2019re many governments in the world. The US is particularly allergic to\na unified ID for some reason. I\u2019m imagining that in the near future we\ncollectively will settle on having a very biocentric ID. Things that are\nlinked to our eyes, our voice, our heartbeat, fingerprints\u2014all the same cues\nthat I use to identify you, that we\u2019re going to use to identify each other,\nand that will have some singular name or number that governments and\nbusinesses will use.\n\nIt\u2019s not completely serious, but I think maybe by the end of this century,\nmost people will have legal names that they choose rather than having legal\nnames that their parents give them. Having a name that your parents give you\nwill be as strange as having an arranged marriage. Changing your name will be\neasier because your identity isn\u2019t going to be in your name, identity\u2019s going\nto be this other stuff.\n\nI think governments will play a role in that. I think it\u2019s to everybody\u2019s\nbenefit to have a stable ID. It just doesn\u2019t make any sense for most people.\nThere are the libertarian types, anarchists are concerned about opting out,\nand that\u2019s a legitimate concern. How do you opt out? Everywhere, until now,\nwe\u2019ve had a frontier where people who wanted to opt out could go opt out. And\nso, we probably want to retain some way for people to opt out of the system.\nIt\u2019s probably healthy to have that mechanism. If we have a world government,\nwhich I think we should, that becomes even more important. The one advantage\nwe have of having multiple national governments is that there\u2019s competition.\nIf you have a world government, that\u2019s a monopoly; you can imagine it getting\nstagnant. I don\u2019t know what the solution is. Maybe there\u2019s two world\ngovernments.\n\nYS: Circling back to the history of the internet and its creation, you might\nhave noticed the Web3 community has a specific attitude towards Web2 and how\nextractive it is. As a key figure in creating Web1, when do you think things\nwent wrong in Web2? What happened?\n\nKK: I don\u2019t think things went wrong. I think Web2 was a much better\nimprovement. I think it\u2019s magnificent, wonderful, fantastic. Can Web2 be\nimproved? Absolutely. And that\u2019s what Web3 is trying to do. But I don\u2019t think\nWeb2 was a step backward. I think it was a step forward. It was much more\nparticipatory and engaging. Social media has been fantastic in terms of\nallowing people to express themselves and have an audience. So I think Web2\nwas a fantastic step forward. And is it the end of it? No. There\u2019s Web3,\nthere\u2019s probably Web4 and 5, and hopefully they\u2019ll make it better. Web3 has\nyet to prove itself in terms of having actual innovations that are adopted.\n\nI know that the Web3 people talk about getting a more decentralized state away\nfrom the big monopoly players, but we had a monopoly. We had Microsoft\nWindows, and I actually argued that that was good. You don\u2019t want to have a\nmonopoly, you want to have an oligopoly. You want to have two or three to\nchoose from. Having those platforms makes it really good and easy for people\nto develop apps and programs because they don\u2019t have to make stuff for 50\ndifferent platforms.\n\nAnd Google, Amazon: I go to Amazon every day because they are so good. Their\nscale allows them to be incredibly efficient and productive in meeting my\nneeds. Are there some dangers? Yes. So there\u2019s some issues with fake reviews\nand counterfeits\u2014we need to get rid of those. Amazon doesn\u2019t seem to be doing\nit as fast as they could, so some pressure is needed. But I don\u2019t want to do\naway with Amazon. I would say the same thing with Facebook. Yes, there are\nsome issues, but compared to what? Let\u2019s make it better, but let\u2019s not get rid\nof it. That\u2019s where I am. I\u2019m interested in improving things rather than\ndestroying things.\n\n### Kevin Kelly: Daddy Issues\n\nMint \u2013 0 ETH\n\nCollectionzora.co\n\nPhotography by Julian Berman.\n\nShare article\n\nLink copied!\n\n## Continue reading\n\nSlide 1 of 11\n\nPerspectives\n\n###\n\nOn\n\nthe\n\nFashion\n\nPhilosophy\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nCrypto\n\nBro\n\nConversations\n\n###\n\nDean\n\nKissick\n\nand\n\nEzra\n\nMiller\n\non\n\nthe\n\nSlot-Machine\n\nSublime\n\nConversations\n\n###\n\nLet\n\n1,000\n\nDAOs\n\nBloom\n\nCuration\n\n###\n\nThe\n\nLexicon\n\nof\n\nLorecore\n\nConversations\n\n###\n\nSeeding\n\nInfinite\n\nGames\n\nwith\n\nEternal\n\nTools\n\n###\n\nAccess\n\nto\n\nTools:\n\nAnna\n\nCarroll\n\nPerspectives\n\n###\n\nClicks\n\nvs.\n\nCollectors\n\nCuration\n\n###\n\nThe\n\nLaws\n\nof\n\nLorecore\n\nPerspectives\n\n###\n\nThe\n\nOnchain\n\nEra\n\nGlossary\n\n###\n\nMetaverse\n\nGlossary\n\nConversations\n\n###\n\nCreator\n\nConfessions:\n\nMax\n\nCapacity\n\nPerspectives\n\n###\n\nOn\n\nthe\n\nFashion\n\nPhilosophy\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nCrypto\n\nBro\n\nConversations\n\n###\n\nDean\n\nKissick\n\nand\n\nEzra\n\nMiller\n\non\n\nthe\n\nSlot-Machine\n\nSublime\n\nConversations\n\n###\n\nLet\n\n1,000\n\nDAOs\n\nBloom\n\nCuration\n\n###\n\nThe\n\nLexicon\n\nof\n\nLorecore\n\nConversations\n\n###\n\nSeeding\n\nInfinite\n\nGames\n\nwith\n\nEternal\n\nTools\n\n###\n\nAccess\n\nto\n\nTools:\n\nAnna\n\nCarroll\n\nPerspectives\n\n###\n\nClicks\n\nvs.\n\nCollectors\n\nCuration\n\n###\n\nThe\n\nLaws\n\nof\n\nLorecore\n\nPerspectives\n\n###\n\nThe\n\nOnchain\n\nEra\n\nGlossary\n\n###\n\nMetaverse\n\nGlossary\n\nConversations\n\n###\n\nCreator\n\nConfessions:\n\nMax\n\nCapacity\n\nPerspectives\n\n###\n\nOn\n\nthe\n\nFashion\n\nPhilosophy\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nCrypto\n\nBro\n\nConversations\n\n###\n\nDean\n\nKissick\n\nand\n\nEzra\n\nMiller\n\non\n\nthe\n\nSlot-Machine\n\nSublime\n\nConversations\n\n###\n\nLet\n\n1,000\n\nDAOs\n\nBloom\n\nCuration\n\n###\n\nThe\n\nLexicon\n\nof\n\nLorecore\n\nConversations\n\n###\n\nSeeding\n\nInfinite\n\nGames\n\nwith\n\nEternal\n\nTools\n\n###\n\nAccess\n\nto\n\nTools:\n\nAnna\n\nCarroll\n\nPerspectives\n\n###\n\nClicks\n\nvs.\n\nCollectors\n\nCuration\n\n###\n\nThe\n\nLaws\n\nof\n\nLorecore\n\nPerspectives\n\n###\n\nThe\n\nOnchain\n\nEra\n\nGlossary\n\n###\n\nMetaverse\n\nGlossary\n\nConversations\n\n###\n\nCreator\n\nConfessions:\n\nMax\n\nCapacity\n\n## Subscribe\n\nYour weekly updates inside the Inbox\n\n", "frontpage": false}
