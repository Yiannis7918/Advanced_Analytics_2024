We depend on it in our\ndaily activities, whether driving cars, flying in airplanes, or paying for\ngroceries.\n\nAs the number of software solutions continues to grow, it\u2019s reasonable to\nanticipate a corresponding rise in incidents caused by software bugs. However,\nif you work at a tech company or depend on software for your daily job, you\nmight notice issues with performance and usability on a regular basis.\n\nWhy does this happen, though? The complexity of modern software plays a\nsignificant role, despite the creation of specialized roles like user\nexperience experts and quality assurance engineers who strive to minimize the\nnumber of bugs in software. Even with these efforts, the industry still\nconfronts significant challenges. This article aims to explore the underlying\nreasons for this ongoing quality crisis, shedding light on why, despite\nadvancements, software quality remains a critical issue.\n\n# What do I mean by quality?\n\nThere are many definitions for quality, when it comes to software. Personally,\nI would define it having in mind the following dimensions: functionality,\nreliability, usability and security,\n\nIn terms of functionality, does the software provide all the necessary\nfeatures for the users to achieve their goals? Does one need to rely on other\npieces of software as well? A really bad example for not fulfilling the\nfunctional aspect when it comes to consumer software is Facebook. You need one\napp to use the platform that serves the news feed, and another one to use the\nchat function, even though the web app offers both functions at the same url.\nA different example, still applied to consumer software, is the video game\nindustry. When I was playing video games back in my college years, I\u2019ve never\nheard a game requiring 20 patches to play. Now, game companies launch their\nproduct, but it still feels as if it\u2019s a beta version. They usually release 2\npatches in the first two days after launching it to make it playable. The\nindustry seems to be completely broken, and the prices are on the rise as\nwell.\n\nFor the reliability aspect, it must be dependable, with minimal downtime or\nerrors. This includes the ability to recover from failures and to maintain\ndata integrity. There are many reports showing that cloud services, or other\ncritical software are not reliable enough. For example, in 2023, Google\nsupport forums were flooded with reports from users complaining that their\ndata has disappeared from Google drive. I personally considered storing data\nin the cloud safer than on a portable drive. It is definitely not!\n\nFrom the usability perspective, the software must be user-friendly, not\noverly-complicated, as well as performant. I live in a place where the\nfinancial sector dominates a large portion of the economy. Banks and\ninvestment companies have tremendous power and close to unlimited resources\nhere. With all that, their mobile banking platforms are a joke! Laggy, complex\nand unintuitive UI\u2019s, I get frustrated all the time when I have to use them.\nEven their feedback form doesn\u2019t work, throwing a 500 whenever I try to submit\nit.\n\nLastly, one of the most important aspects: security. Software nowadays has\nmany dependencies, and we all know how hard it can be to manage them and keep\nthem up-to-date. Even with automatic tools like Renovate or Dependabot, the\nproviders for various libraries do not even ensure backwards compatibility for\ntheir newer major versions. This makes the job of the developers much harder,\nand often they are forced to handle these dependency upgrades manually.\nHowever, before they manage to do it, attackers might already use the\nvulnerabilities of old dependencies to steal user data. Such breaches are not\njust inconveniences for companies that may face legal actions from angry\nusers, they are a danger for the end users as well. Thousands of Gigabytes of\nuser data, like emails, passwords or even phone numbers, are dumped everyday\non dark web forums. This is the main reason why we notice a spike in spam\ncalls all over the world.\n\n# What\u2019s broken?\n\nNow that I have defined what quality is, I am going to give my personal\nopinion on what\u2019s broken with software nowadays. I must warn you that you will\nsee many direct references to either people or groups of people in this\nsection. Needless to say that I do not intend to blame anyone, any group or\nprofession for the mess that we\u2019re in. I just want to provide my view, shaped\nby more than 10 years of experience working in this industry. It\u2019s just a\npersonal opinion based on anecdotes, so don\u2019t get defensive or take this\npersonally in any way.\n\nThere\u2019s a competency crisis affecting the world right now. People are just too\ndistracted due to the immense volume of entertainment we are subjected to\nevery day. The attention span for everyone is decreasing to the point where we\ncannot stay concentrated for more than a few minutes.\n\nIn my experience, this problem is really prevalent among the youngest people.\nI had the pleasure to work with brilliant people that are part of the Gen Z\nbracket, but most of the ones I worked with can\u2019t get anything done. It\u2019s not\nlack of experience, it\u2019s because they are constantly defaulting to their\nphones, watching endless videos or even playing games while they are supposed\nto deliver. It sometimes feels like you\u2019re working with an addict. And it\u2019s\nnot just me, there are scientific studies showing the level of addiction to\nsocial media among this age group.\n\nPeople cannot focus hard and long enough to handle complex tasks properly\nanymore, and this translates to more bugs, more usability problems and less\ndedication to their jobs and their mission as software developers.\n\nOne would counteract this point of view saying that effective software teams\nnowadays need to follow the latest best practices to maintain quality. TDD,\nevent-driven architecture, hermetic testing, pushing straight to master and\nother esoteric concepts will help your team deliver continuously and maintain\nthe quality level at the peak. Let\u2019s take a step back and analyze where these\nsuggestions are coming from?\n\nOne of the thought leaders of software engineering is Martin Fowler. Many\nengineers follow blindly everything that he proposes. I\u2019ve seen this trend in\nmany companies, especially in cult-like organizations that brag about their\nunmatched engineering culture. Many such organizations will build\nmicroservices even if their software domain complexity is not high and the\nsoftware itself is not projected to scale that much. They will do it because\ntheir God told them to do it. But how did he, and other such leaders become so\ninfluential? They must have built world-class software themselves, right?\n\nI searched for what Martin Fowler built everywhere. There\u2019s no open source, or\nany published closed-source software that is marketed as being built by him.\nSo I am asking again: how did he become so famous? Simply, by feeding what\nmediocre engineers crave for: controversy.\n\nBuilding software nowadays is not about engineering anymore. It\u2019s about\nchoosing the right design patterns for the job. This comes as a result of the\nprevalence of high-level programming language, where thinking about complex\nthings like memory allocation is not necessary anymore. This democratizes the\naccess to a software engineering career to almost anyone. It\u2019s not a thing for\nthe truly passionate people. The main effect is that the standard lowers to\nsuch an extent, that you get to have people in your team that don\u2019t even write\ncode everyday, but they are highly-appreciated by non-technical managers for\ntheir level of implication in endless debates about whether one should use TDD\nor not. The value that these people bring is close to zero, and this reflects\nin the software they deliver.\n\nWith the emergence of those programming languages, and the abundance of\nframeworks that many companies release, the level of abstraction is on the\nrise. This gradually removes the need for engineers to develop a deep\nunderstanding of the technologies they\u2019re using. They just don\u2019t need that\nanymore. Don\u2019t get me wrong, this has its own advantages. The fact that you\nget to be more productive, and everything now has a faster learning curve are\ngreat achievements. However, increasing the dependency on those tools can lead\nto a risk where engineers may lack a deep understanding of underlying\nprinciples, which can be crucial in debugging, optimization, and understanding\nthe limitations of abstractions.\n\nAll in all, I believe software is broken due to these main reasons: lack of\nfocus, fake engineers, as well as lack of deep understanding of what lies\nbeneath the abstraction. I am really curious how AI is going to exacerbate the\nquality crisis we see in software nowadays. My bet is that in few years the\nsituation will get worse, and good engineers will be forced out of the\nindustry by their mediocre counterparts, as they might be preferred being more\nvocal and preaching what the fake gurus of the industry come up with.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Facebook\n  * X\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### Related\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nbitheap\n\nFollow us\n\n  * Login\n  * Sign Up\n\nWe noticed you're visiting from United Kingdom (UK).
