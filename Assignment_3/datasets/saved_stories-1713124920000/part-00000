For other uses, see The Hero's Journey\n(disambiguation).\n\nNot to be confused with Hiero's Journey.\n\nIllustration of the hero's journey\n\nIn narratology and comparative mythology, the hero's journey, also known as\nthe monomyth, is the common template of stories that involve a hero who goes\non an adventure, is victorious in a decisive crisis, and comes home changed or\ntransformed.\n\nEarlier figures had proposed similar concepts, including psychoanalyst Otto\nRank and amateur anthropologist Lord Raglan.^[1] Eventually, hero myth pattern\nstudies were popularized by Joseph Campbell, who was influenced by Carl Jung's\nanalytical psychology. Campbell used the monomyth to analyze and compare\nreligions. In his famous book The Hero with a Thousand Faces (1949), he\ndescribes the narrative pattern as follows:\n\n> A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of\n> supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive\n> victory is won: the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the\n> power to bestow boons on his fellow man.\n\nCampbell's theories regarding the concept of a \"monomyth\" have been the\nsubject of criticism from scholars, particularly folklorists (scholars active\nin folklore studies), who have dismissed the concept as a non-scholarly\napproach suffering from source-selection bias, among other criticisms. More\nrecently, the hero's journey has been analyzed as an example of the\nsympathetic plot, a universal narrative structure in which a goal-directed\nprotagonist confronts obstacles, overcomes them, and eventually reaps\nrewards.^[1]^[2]\n\n## Background[edit]\n\nFurther information: Rank\u2013Raglan mythotype\n\nThe study of hero myth narratives can be traced back to 1871 with\nanthropologist Edward Burnett Tylor's observations of common patterns in the\nplots of heroes' journeys.^[3] In narratology and comparative mythology,\nothers have proposed narrative patterns such as psychoanalyst Otto Rank in\n1909 and amateur anthropologist Lord Raglan in 1936.^[4] Both Rank and Raglan\nhave lists of cross-cultural traits often found in the accounts of mythical\nheroes^[5]^[6] and discuss hero narrative patterns in terms of Freudian\npsychoanalysis and ritualism.^[1] According to Robert Segal, \"The theories of\nRank, Campbell, and Raglan typify the array of analyses of hero myths.\"^[3]\n\n## Terminology[edit]\n\nCampbell borrowed the word monomyth from James Joyce's Finnegans Wake (1939).\nCampbell was a notable scholar of Joyce's work and in A Skeleton Key to\nFinnegans Wake (1944) co-authored the seminal analysis of Joyce's final\nnovel.^[7]^[8] Campbell's singular the monomyth implies that the \"hero's\njourney\" is the ultimate narrative archetype, but the term monomyth has\noccasionally been used more generally, as a term for a mythological archetype\nor a supposed mytheme that re-occurs throughout the world's cultures.^[9]^[10]\nOmry Ronen referred to Vyacheslav Ivanov's treatment of Dionysus as an \"avatar\nof Christ\" (1904) as \"Ivanov's monomyth\".^[11]\n\nThe phrase \"the hero's journey\", used in reference to Campbell's monomyth,\nfirst entered into popular discourse through two documentaries. The first,\nreleased in 1987, The Hero's Journey: The World of Joseph Campbell, was\naccompanied by a 1990 companion book, The Hero's Journey: Joseph Campbell on\nHis Life and Work (with Phil Cousineau and Stuart Brown, eds.). The second was\nBill Moyers's series of seminal interviews with Campbell, released in 1988 as\nthe documentary (and companion book) The Power of Myth. Cousineau in the\nintroduction to the revised edition of The Hero's Journey wrote \"the monomyth\nis in effect a meta myth, a philosophical reading of the unity of mankind's\nspiritual history, the Story behind the story\".^[12]\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\nIn his book The Hero with a Thousand Faces (1949), Campbell summarizes the\nnarrative pattern of the monomyth as follows:\n\n> A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of\n> supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive\n> victory is won: the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the\n> power to bestow boons on his fellow man.^[13]\n\nCampbell describes 17 stages of the monomyth. Not all monomyths necessarily\ncontain all 17 stages explicitly; some myths may focus on only one of the\nstages, while others may deal with the stages in a somewhat different\norder.^[14] In the terminology of Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, the stages are the\nindividual mythemes which are \"bundled\" or assembled into the structure of the\nmonomyth.^[15]\n\nThe 17 stages may be organized in a number of ways, including division into\nthree \"acts\" or sections:\n\n  1. Departure (also Separation),\n  2. Initiation (sometimes subdivided into A. Descent and B. Initiation) and\n  3. Return.\n\nIn the departure part of the narrative, the hero or protagonist lives in the\nordinary world and receives a call to go on an adventure. The hero is\nreluctant to follow the call but is helped by a mentor figure.\n\nThe initiation section begins with the hero then traversing the threshold to\nan unknown or \"special world\", where he faces tasks or trials, either alone or\nwith the assistance of helpers. The hero eventually reaches \"the innermost\ncave\" or the central crisis of his adventure, where he must undergo \"the\nordeal\" where he overcomes the main obstacle or enemy, undergoing \"apotheosis\"\nand gaining his reward (a treasure or \"elixir\").\n\nIn the return section, the hero must return to the ordinary world with his\nreward. He may be pursued by the guardians of the special world, or he may be\nreluctant to return and may be rescued or forced to return by intervention\nfrom the outside. The hero again traverses the threshold between the worlds,\nreturning to the ordinary world with the treasure or elixir he gained, which\nhe may now use for the benefit of his fellow man. The hero himself is\ntransformed by the adventure and gains wisdom or spiritual power over both\nworlds.\n\nAct| Campbell (1949)| Christopher Vogler (2007)^[16]  \n---|---|---  \nI.

According to\nCampbell, this region is represented by\n\n> a distant land, a forest, a kingdom underground, beneath the waves, or above\n> the sky, a secret island, lofty mountaintop, or profound dream state; but it\n> is always a place of strangely fluid and polymorphous beings, unimaginable\n> torments, superhuman deeds, and impossible delight. The hero can go forth of\n> their own volition to accomplish the adventure, as did Theseus when he\n> arrived in his father's city, Athens, and heard the horrible history of the\n> Minotaur; or they may be carried or sent abroad by some benign or malignant\n> agent as was Odysseus, driven about the Mediterranean by the winds of the\n> angered god, Poseidon. The adventure may begin as a mere blunder... or\n> still, again, one may be only casually strolling when some passing\n> phenomenon catches the wandering eye and lures one away from the frequented\n> paths of man. Examples might be multiplied, ad infinitum, from every corner\n> of the world.^[17]\n\n#### Refusal of the Call[edit]\n\nOften when the call is given, the future hero first refuses to heed it. This\nmay be from a sense of duty or obligation, fear, insecurity, a sense of\ninadequacy, or any of a range of reasons that work to hold the person in his\ncurrent circumstances. Campbell says that\n\n> Refusal of the summons converts the adventure into its negative. Walled in\n> boredom, hard work, or \"culture,\" the subject loses the power of significant\n> affirmative action and becomes a victim to be saved. His flowering world\n> becomes a wasteland of dry stones and his life feels meaningless\u2014even\n> though, like King Minos, he may through titanic effort succeed in building\n> an empire of renown. Whatever house he builds, it will be a house of death:\n> a labyrinth of cyclopean walls to hide from him his Minotaur. All he can do\n> is create new problems for himself and await the gradual approach of his\n> disintegration.^[18]\n\n#### Supernatural Aid[edit]\n\nOnce the hero has committed to the quest, consciously or unconsciously, their\nguide and magical helper appears or becomes known. More often than not, this\nsupernatural mentor will present the hero with one or more talismans or\nartifacts that will aid them later in their quest.^[19] Campbell writes:\n\n> What such a figure represents is benign, protecting power of destiny. The\n> fantasy is a reassurance\u2014promise that the peace of Paradise, which was known\n> first within the mother womb, is not to be lost; that it supports the\n> present and stands in the future as well as in the past (is omega as well as\n> alpha); that though omnipotence may seem to be endangered by the threshold\n> of the world. One has only to know and trust, and the ageless guardians will\n> appear. Having responded to their own call, and continuing to follow\n> courageously as the consequences unfold, the hero finds all the forces of\n> the unconscious at their side. Mother Nature herself supports the mighty\n> task. And in so far as the hero's act coincides with that for which their\n> society itself is ready, they seem to ride on the great rhythm of the\n> historical process.^[20]\n\n#### The Crossing of the First Threshold[edit]\n\nThis is the point where the hero actually crosses into the field of adventure,\nleaving the known limits of their world and venturing into an unknown and\ndangerous realm where the rules and limits are unknown. Campbell tells us,\n\n> With the personifications of his destiny to guide and aid him, the hero goes\n> forward in his adventure until he comes to the \"threshold guardian\" at the\n> entrance to the zone of magnified power. Such custodians bound the world in\n> four directions\u2014also up and down\u2014standing for the limits of the hero's\n> present sphere, or life horizon. Beyond them is darkness, the unknown, and\n> danger; just as beyond the parental watch is a danger to the infant and\n> beyond the protection of his society danger to the members of the tribe. The\n> usual person is more than content, he is even proud, to remain within the\n> indicated bounds, and popular belief gives him every reason to fear so much\n> as the first step into the unexplored.\n>\n> ...\n>\n> The adventure is always and everywhere a passage beyond the veil of the\n> known into the unknown; the powers that watch at the boundary are dangerous;\n> to deal with them is risky, yet for anyone with competence and courage the\n> danger fades.^[21]\n\n#### Belly of the Whale[edit]\n\nThe belly of the whale represents the final separation from the hero's known\nworld and self. By entering this stage, the person shows a willingness to\nundergo a metamorphosis. When first entering the stage the hero may encounter\na minor danger or setback. According to Campbell,\n\n> The idea that the passage of the magical threshold is a transit into a\n> sphere of rebirth is symbolized in the worldwide womb image of the belly of\n> the whale. The hero, instead of conquering or conciliating the power of the\n> threshold, is swallowed into the unknown and would appear to have died.\n>\n> ...\n>\n> This popular motif gives emphasis to the lesson that the passage of the\n> threshold is a form of self-annihilation. ... [I]nstead of passing outward,\n> beyond the confines of the visible world, the hero goes inward, to be born\n> again. The disappearance corresponds to the passing of a worshiper into the\n> temple\u2014where he is to be quickened by the recollection of who and what he\n> is, namely dust and ashes unless immortal. The temple interior, the belly of\n> the whale, and the heavenly land beyond, above, and below the confines of\n> the world, are one and the same. That is why the approaches of and entrances\n> to temples are flanked and defended by colossal gargoyles [equivalent to]\n> the two rows of teeth of the whale. They illustrate the fact that the\n> devotee at the moment of entry into a temple undergoes a metamorphosis. ...\n> Once inside he may be said to have died to time and returned to the World\n> Womb, the World Navel, the Earthly Paradise. ... Allegorically, then, the\n> passage into a temple and the hero-dive through the jaws of the whale are\n> identical adventures, both denoting in picture language, the life-centering,\n> life-renewing act.^[22]\n\nIn the exemplary Book of Jonah, the eponymous Israelite refuses God's command\nto prophesy the destruction of Nineveh and attempts to flee by sailing to\nTarshish. A storm arises, and the sailors cast lots to determine that Jonah is\nto blame. He allows himself to be thrown overboard to calm the storm, and is\nsaved from drowning by being swallowed by a \"great fish\". Over three days,\nJonah commits to God's will, and he is vomited safely onto the shore. He\nsubsequently goes to Nineveh and preaches to its inhabitants.^[23] Jonah's\npassage through the belly of the whale can be viewed as a symbolic death and\nrebirth in Jungian analysis.^[24]\n\nIn The Power of Myth, Campbell agrees with Bill Moyers that the original Star\nWars film's trash-compactor scene on the Death Star is a strong example of\nthis step of the journey.^[25]\n\n### Initiation[edit]\n\n#### The Road of Trials[edit]\n\nThe road of trials is a series of tests that the hero must undergo to begin\nthe transformation. Often the hero fails one or more of these tests, which\noften occur in threes. Eventually, the hero will overcome these trials and\nmove on to the next step. Campbell explains that\n\n> Once having traversed the threshold, the hero moves in a dream landscape of\n> curiously fluid, ambiguous forms, where he must survive a succession of\n> trials. This is a favorite phase of the myth-adventure. It has produced a\n> world literature of miraculous tests and ordeals. The hero is covertly aided\n> by the advice, amulets, and secret agents of the supernatural helper whom he\n> met before his entrance into this region. Or it may be that he here\n> discovers for the first time that there is a benign power everywhere\n> supporting him in his superhuman passage.\n>\n> ...\n>\n> The original departure into the land of trials represented only the\n> beginning of the long and really perilous path of initiatory conquests and\n> moments of illumination. Dragons have now to be slain and surprising\n> barriers passed\u2014again, again, and again. Meanwhile, there will be a\n> multitude of preliminary victories, unsustainable ecstasies, and momentary\n> glimpses of the wonderful land.^[26]\n\n#### The Meeting with the Goddess[edit]\n\nThis is where the hero gains items given to him that will help him in the\nfuture. Campbell proposes that\n\n> The ultimate adventure, when all the barriers and ogres have been overcome,\n> is commonly represented as a mystical marriage of the triumphant hero-soul\n> with the Queen Goddess of the World. This is the crisis at the nadir, the\n> zenith, or at the uttermost edge of the earth, at the central point of the\n> cosmos, in the tabernacle of the temple, or within the darkness of the\n> deepest chamber of the heart.\n>\n> ...\n>\n> The meeting with the goddess (who is incarnate in every woman) is the final\n> test of the talent of the hero to win the boon of love (charity: amor fati),\n> which is life itself enjoyed as the encasement of eternity.\n>\n> And when the adventurer, in this context, is not a youth but a maid, she is\n> the one who, by her qualities, her beauty, or her yearning, is fit to become\n> the consort of an immortal. Then the heavenly husband descends to her and\n> conducts her to his bed\u2014whether she will or not. And if she has shunned him,\n> the scales fall from her eyes; if she has sought him, her desire finds its\n> peace.^[27]\n\n#### Woman as the Temptress[edit]\n\nIn this step, the hero faces those temptations, often of a physical or\npleasurable nature, that may lead them to abandon or stray from their quest,\nwhich does not necessarily have to be represented by a woman. A woman is a\nmetaphor for the physical or material temptations of life since the hero-\nknight was often tempted by lust from his spiritual journey. Campbell relates\nthat\n\n> The crux of the curious difficulty lies in the fact that our conscious views\n> of what life ought to be seldom correspond to what life really is.\n> Generally, we refuse to admit within ourselves, or within our friends, the\n> fullness of that pushing, self-protective, malodorous, carnivorous,\n> lecherous fever which is the very nature of the organic cell. Rather, we\n> tend to perfume, whitewash, and reinterpret; meanwhile imagining that all\n> the flies in the ointment, all the hairs in the soup, are the faults of some\n> unpleasant someone else. But when it suddenly dawns on us or is forced to\n> our attention that everything we think or do is necessarily tainted with the\n> odor of the flesh, then, not uncommonly, there is experienced a moment of\n> revulsion: life, the acts of life, the organs of life, a woman in particular\n> as the great symbol of life, become intolerable to the pure, the pure, pure\n> soul. ... The seeker of the life beyond life must press beyond [the woman],\n> surpass the temptations of her call, and soar to the immaculate ether\n> beyond.^[28]\n\n#### Atonement with the Father/Abyss[edit]\n\nIn this step, the hero must confront and be initiated by whatever holds the\nultimate power in their life. In many myths and stories, this is the father or\na father figure who has life and death power. This is the center point of the\njourney. All the previous steps have been moving into this place, all that\nfollow will move out from it. Although this step is most frequently symbolized\nby an encounter with a male entity, it does not have to be a male\u2014just someone\nor something with incredible power. Per Campbell,\n\n> Atonement consists in no more than the abandonment of that self-generated\n> double monster\u2014the dragon thought to be God (superego) and the dragon\n> thought to be Sin (repressed id). But this requires an abandonment of the\n> attachment to ego itself, and that is what is difficult. One must have faith\n> that the father is merciful, and then a reliance on that mercy. Therewith,\n> the center of belief is transferred outside of the bedeviling god's tight\n> scaly ring, and the dreadful ogres dissolve. It is in this ordeal that the\n> hero may derive hope and assurance from the helpful female figure, by whose\n> magic (pollen charms or power of intercession) they are protected through\n> all the frightening experiences of the father's ego-shattering initiation.\n> For if it is impossible to trust the terrifying father-face, then one's\n> faith must be centered elsewhere (Spider Woman, Blessed Mother); and with\n> that reliance for support, one endures the crisis\u2014only to find, in the end,\n> that the father and mother reflect each other, and are in essence the\n> same.^[29]\n\nCampbell later expounds:\n\n> The problem of the hero going to meet the father is to open his soul beyond\n> terror to such a degree that he will be ripe to understand how the sickening\n> and insane tragedies of this vast and ruthless cosmos are completely\n> validated in the majesty of Being. The hero transcends life with its\n> peculiar blind spot and for a moment rises to a glimpse of the source. They\n> behold the face of the father, understand \u2014 and the two are atoned.^[30]\n\n#### Apotheosis[edit]\n\nFurther information: Apotheosis\n\nThis is the point of realization in which a greater understanding is achieved.\nArmed with this new knowledge and perception, the hero is resolved and ready\nfor the more difficult part of the adventure. Campbell discloses that\n\n> Those who know, not only that the Everlasting lies in them, but that what\n> they, and all things, really are is the Everlasting, dwell in the groves of\n> the wish-fulfilling trees, drink the brew of immortality, and listen\n> everywhere to the unheard music of eternal concord.^[31]\n\n#### The Ultimate Boon[edit]\n\nThe ultimate boon is the achievement of the goal of the quest. It is what the\nhero went on the journey to get. All the previous steps serve to prepare and\npurify the hero for this step since in many myths the boon is something\ntranscendent like the elixir of life itself, or a plant that supplies\nimmortality, or the holy grail. Campbell confers that\n\n> The gods and goddesses then are to be understood as embodiments and\n> custodians of the elixir of Imperishable Being but not themselves the\n> Ultimate in its primary state. What the hero seeks through his intercourse\n> with them is therefore not finally themselves, but their grace, i.e., the\n> power of their sustaining substance. This miraculous energy-substance and\n> this alone is the Imperishable; the names and forms of the deities who\n> everywhere embody, dispense, and represent it come and go. This is the\n> miraculous energy of the thunderbolts of Zeus, Yahweh, and the Supreme\n> Buddha, the fertility of the rain of Viracocha, the virtue announced by the\n> bell rung in the Mass at the consecration, and the light of the ultimate\n> illumination of the saint and sage. Its guardians dare release it only to\n> the duly proven.^[32]\n\n### Return[edit]\n\n#### Refusal of the Return[edit]\n\nHaving found bliss and enlightenment in the other world, the hero may not want\nto return to the ordinary world to bestow the boon onto their fellow beings.\nCampbell continues:\n\n> When the hero-quest has been accomplished, through penetration to the\n> source, or through the grace of some male or female, human or animal\n> personification, the adventurer still must return with his life-transmuting\n> trophy. The full round, the norm of the monomyth, requires that the hero\n> shall now begin the labor of bringing the runes of wisdom, the Golden\n> Fleece, or his sleeping princess, back into the kingdom of humanity, where\n> the boon may redound to the renewing of the community, the nation, the\n> planet, or the ten thousand worlds. But the responsibility has been\n> frequently refused. Even Gautama Buddha, after his triumph, doubted whether\n> the message of realization could be communicated, and saints are reported to\n> have died while in the supernal ecstasy. Numerous indeed are the heroes\n> fabled to have taken up residence forever in the blessed isle of the unaging\n> Goddess of Immortal Being.^[33]\n\n#### The Magic Flight[edit]\n\nSometimes the hero must escape with the boon if it is something that the gods\nhave been jealously guarding. It can be just as adventurous and dangerous\nreturning from the journey as it was to go on it. Campbell argues that\n\n> If the hero in his triumph wins the blessing of the goddess or the god and\n> is then explicitly commissioned to return to the world with some elixir for\n> the restoration of society, the final stage of his adventure is supported by\n> all the powers of his supernatural patron. On the other hand, if the trophy\n> has been attained against the opposition of its guardian, or if the hero's\n> wish to return to the world has been resented by the gods or demons, then\n> the last stage of the mythological round becomes a lively, often comical,\n> pursuit. This flight may be complicated by marvels of magical obstruction\n> and evasion.^[34]\n\n#### Rescue from Without[edit]\n\nJust as the hero may need guides and assistants to set out on the quest, often\nthey must have powerful guides and rescuers to bring them back to everyday\nlife, especially if the hero has been wounded or weakened by the experience.\nCampbell elucidates,\n\n> The hero may have to be brought back from his supernatural adventure by\n> assistance from without. That is to say, the world may have to come and get\n> him. For the bliss of the deep abode is not lightly abandoned in favor of\n> the [disorder] of the wakened state. ... Society is jealous of those who\n> remain away from it and will come knocking at the door. If the hero ... is\n> unwilling, the disturber suffers an ugly shock; but on the other hand, if\n> the summoned one is only delayed\u2014sealed in by the [deathlike rapture] of a\n> perfect being ... an apparent rescue is effected, and the adventurer\n> returns.^[35]\n\n#### The Crossing of the Return Threshold[edit]\n\nCampbell says in The Hero with a Thousand Faces that \"The returning hero, to\ncomplete his adventure, must survive the impact of the world.\"^[36] The goal\nof the return is to retain the wisdom gained on the quest and to integrate it\ninto society. Campbell writes,\n\n> Many failures attest to the difficulties of this life-affirmative threshold.\n> The first problem of the returning hero is to accept as real, after an\n> experience of the soul-satisfying vision of fulfillment, the [ups and downs]\n> of life. Why re-enter such a world? Why [share] the experience of\n> transcendental bliss? As dreams that were momentous by night may seem simply\n> silly in the light of day, so the poet and the prophet can discover\n> themselves playing the idiot before [others]. The easy thing is to commit\n> the whole community to the devil and retire again into [bliss]. But if some\n> spiritual obstetrician has drawn the shimenawa across the retreat, then the\n> work of [distilling eternal truth] cannot be avoided.^[37]\n\n#### Master of the Two Worlds[edit]\n\nFor a human hero, it may mean achieving a balance between the material and\nspiritual. The person has become comfortable and competent in both the inner\nand outer worlds. Campbell demonstrates that\n\n> Freedom to pass back and forth across the world division, from the\n> perspective of the apparitions of time to that of the causal deep and\n> back\u2014not contaminating the principles of the one with those of the other,\n> yet permitting the mind to know the one by virtue of the other\u2014is the talent\n> of the master. The Cosmic Dancer, declares Nietzsche, does not rest heavily\n> in a single spot, but gaily, lightly, turns and leaps from one position to\n> another. It is possible to speak from only one point at a time, but that\n> does not invalidate the insights of the rest.^[38]\n\nDiscussing this stage, Campbell cites the Apostles of Jesus, who had become\nselfless in their devotion by the time of their master's transfiguration, as\nwell as the similar orthodoxy presented by Krishna, who said, \"He who does My\nwork and regards Me as the Supreme Goal ... without hatred for any creature\u2014he\ncomes to Me.\"^[39] Campbell goes on to illustrate that\n\n> The individual, through prolonged psychological disciplines, gives up\n> completely all attachment to his personal limitations, idiosyncrasies, hopes\n> and fears, no longer resists the self-annihilation that is prerequisite to\n> rebirth in the realization of truth, and so becomes ripe, at last, for the\n> great at-one-ment. His personal ambitions being totally dissolved, he no\n> longer tries to live but willingly relaxes to whatever may come to pass in\n> him; he becomes, that is to say, an anonymity.^[39]\n\n#### Freedom to Live[edit]\n\nIn this step, mastery leads to freedom from the fear of death, which in turn\nis the freedom to live. This is sometimes referred to as living in the moment,\nneither anticipating the future nor regretting the past. Campbell declares,\n\n> The hero is the champion of things becoming, not of things become, because\n> he is. \"Before Abraham was, I AM.\" He does not mistake apparent\n> changelessness in time for the permanence of Being, nor is he fearful of the\n> next moment (or of the \"other thing\"), as destroying the permanent with its\n> change. [Quoting Ovid's Metamorphoses:] \"Nothing retains its own form; but\n> Nature, the greater renewer, ever makes up forms from forms. Be sure that\n> nothing perishes in the whole universe; it does but vary and renew its\n> form.\" Thus the next moment is permitted to come to pass.^[40]\n\n## In popular culture and literature[edit]\n\nThe monomyth concept has been popular in American literary studies and writing\nguides since at least the 1970s. Christopher Vogler, a Hollywood film producer\nand writer, created a 7-page company memo, A Practical Guide to The Hero with\na Thousand Faces,^[41] based on Campbell's work. Vogler's memo was later\ndeveloped into the late 1990s book The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure for\nWriters.\n\nGeorge Lucas's 1977 film Star Wars was classified as monomyth almost as soon\nas it came out.^[42]^[43] In addition to the extensive discussion between\nCampbell and Bill Moyers broadcast in 1988 as The Power of Myth, Lucas gave an\nextensive interview in which he states that after completing American\nGraffiti, \"it came to me that there really was no modern use of mythology...\nso that's when I started doing more strenuous research on fairy tales,\nfolklore, and mythology, and I started reading Joe's books. ... It was very\neerie because in reading The Hero with a Thousand Faces I began to realize\nthat my first draft of Star Wars was following classical motifs\".^[44] Moyers\nand Lucas also met for a 1999 interview to further discuss the impact of\nCampbell's work on Lucas's films.^[45] In addition, the National Air and Space\nMuseum of the Smithsonian Institution sponsored an exhibit during the late\n1990s called Star Wars: The Magic of Myth which discussed the ways in which\nCampbell's work shaped the Star Wars saga.^[46]\n\nNumerous literary works of popular fiction have been identified by various\nauthors as examples of the monomyth template, including Spenser's The Faerie\nQueene,^[47] Melville's Moby-Dick,^[48] Charlotte Bront\u00eb's Jane Eyre,^[49]\nworks by Charles Dickens, William Faulkner, Somerset Maugham, J. D.\nSalinger,^[50] Ernest Hemingway,^[51] Mark Twain,^[52] W. B. Yeats,^[53] C. S.\nLewis,^[54] J. R. R. Tolkien,^[55] Seamus Heaney^[56] and Stephen King,^[57]\nPlato's allegory of the cave, Homer's Odyssey, L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful\nWizard of Oz, and Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, amongst\nmany others.\n\nStanley Kubrick introduced Arthur C. Clarke to the book The Hero with a\nThousand Faces by Joseph Campbell during the writing of 2001: A Space Odyssey.\nArthur C. Clarke called Joseph Campbell's book \"very stimulating\" in his diary\nentry.^[58]\n\n## Feminist literature and female heroines within the monomyth[edit]\n\n### Jane Eyre[edit]\n\nCharlotte Bront\u00eb's character Jane Eyre is an important figure in illustrating\nheroines and their place within the hero's journey. Charlotte Bront\u00eb sought to\ncraft a unique female character that the term \"Heroine\" could fully\nencompass.^[59] Jane Eyre is a Bildungsroman, a coming-of-age story common in\nVictorian fiction, also referred to as an apprenticeship novel, that shows\nmoral and psychological development of the protagonist as they grow into\nadults.^[59]\n\nJane, being a middle-class Victorian woman, would face entirely different\nobstacles and conflict than her male counterparts of this era such as Pip in\nGreat Expectations. This would change the course of the hero's journey because\nBront\u00eb was able to recognize the fundamental conflict that plagued women of\nthis time (one main source of this conflict being women's relationship with\npower and wealth and often being distant from obtaining both).^[60]\n\nCharlotte Bront\u00eb takes Jane's character a step further by making her more\npassionate and outspoken than other Victorian women of this time. The abuse\nand psychological trauma Jane receives from the Reeds as a child cause her to\ndevelop two central goals for her to complete her heroine journey: a need to\nlove and to be loved, and her need for liberty.^[59] Jane accomplishes part of\nattaining liberty when she castigates Mrs. Reed for treating her poorly as a\nchild, obtaining the freedom of her mind.\n\nAs Jane grows throughout the novel, she also becomes unwilling to sacrifice\none of her goals for the other. When Rochester, the \"temptress\" in her\njourney, asks her to stay with him as his mistress, she refuses, as it would\njeopardize the freedom she had struggled to obtain. She instead returns after\nRochester's wife passes away, now free to marry him and able to achieve both\nof her goals and complete her role in the hero's journey.^[59]\n\nWhile the story ends with a marriage trope, Bront\u00eb has Jane return to\nRochester after several chances to grow, allowing her to return as close to\nequals as possible while also having fleshed out her growth within the\nheroine's journey. Since Jane is able to marry Rochester as an equal and\nthrough her own means, this makes Jane one of the most satisfying and\nfulfilling heroines in literature and in the heroine's journey.\n\n### Psyche[edit]\n\nThe story Metamorphoses (also known as The Golden Ass) by Apuleius in 158 A.D.\nis one of the most enduring and retold myths involving the hero's\njourney.^[61] The tale of Cupid and Psyche is a frame tale\u2014a story within a\nstory\u2014and is one of the thirteen stories within \"Metamorphoses.\" The use of\nthe frame tale puts both the storyteller and reader into the novel as\ncharacters, which explores the main aspect of the hero's journey due to it\nbeing a process of tradition where literature is written and read.^[61]\n\nCupid and Psyche's tale has become the most popular of Metamorphoses and has\nbeen retold many times with successful iterations dating as recently as 1956's\nTill We Have Faces by C.S. Lewis.^[61] Much of the tale's captivation comes\nfrom the central heroine, Psyche. Psyche's place within the hero's journey is\nfascinating and complex as it revolves around her characteristics of being a\nbeautiful woman and the conflict that arises from it. Psyche's beauty causes\nher to become ostracized from society because no male suitors will ask to\nmarry her as they feel unworthy of her seemingly divine beauty and kind\nnature. Psyche's call to adventure is involuntary: her beauty enrages the\ngoddess Venus, which results in Psyche being banished from her home.^[61]\n\nPart of what makes Psyche such a polarizing figure within the heroine's\njourney is her nature and ability to triumph over the unfair trials set upon\nher by Venus. Psyche is given four seemingly impossible tasks by Venus to get\nher husband Cupid back: the sorting of the seeds, the fleecing of the golden\nrams, collecting a crystal jar full of the water of death and retrieving a\nbeauty creme from Hades.^[61] The last task is considered to be one of the\nmost monumental and memorable tasks ever to be taken on in the history of the\nheroine's journey due to its difficulty. Yet, Psyche is able to achieve each\ntask and complete her ultimate goal of becoming an immortal goddess and moving\nto Mount Olympus to be with her husband Cupid for all eternity.\n\nDuring the early 19th century, a Norwegian version of the Psyche myth was\ncollected in Finnmark by Peter Christen Asbj\u00f8rnsen and J\u00f8rgen Moe, who is\nstill considered to be Norway's answer to the Brothers Grimm. It was published\nin their legendary anthology Norwegian Folktales. The fairy tale is titled\n\"East o' the Sun and West o' the Moon\".\n\n## Self-help movement and therapy[edit]\n\nPoet Robert Bly, Michael J. Meade, and others involved in the mythopoetic\nmen's movement have also applied and expanded the concepts of the hero's\njourney and the monomyth as a metaphor for personal spiritual and\npsychological growth.^[62]^[63]\n\nCharacteristic of the mythopoetic men's movement is a tendency to retell fairy\ntales and engage in their exegesis as a tool for personal insight. Using\nfrequent references to archetypes as drawn from Jungian analytical psychology,\nthe movement focuses on issues of gender role, gender identity and wellness\nfor modern men.^[63] Advocates would often engage in storytelling with music,\nthese acts being seen as a modern extension to a form of \"new age shamanism\"\npopularized by Michael Harner at approximately the same time. ^[by whom?]\n\nAmong its most famous advocates was the poet Robert Bly, whose book Iron John:\nA Book About Men was a best-seller, being an exegesis of the fairy tale \"Iron\nJohn\" by the Brothers Grimm.^[62]\n\nThe mythopoetic men's movement spawned a variety of groups and workshops, led\nby authors such as Bly and Robert L. Moore.^[63] Some serious academic work\ncame out of this movement, including the creation of various magazines and\nnon-profit organizations.^[62]\n\nResearch published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology in 2023\nprovided evidence that viewing one's life through the Hero's Journey narrative\ncan significantly enhance a sense of life meaning and resilience. This effect\nwas consistently observed across various demographics and methodologies.^[64]\n\n## Academic reception and criticism[edit]\n\nCampbell's approach to myth, a genre of folklore, has been the subject of\ncriticism from folklorists, academics who specialize in folklore studies.\nAmerican folklorist Barre Toelken notes that few psychologists have taken the\ntime to become familiar with the complexities of folklore, and that,\nhistorically, Jung-influenced psychologists and authors have tended to build\ncomplex theories around single versions of a tale that supports a theory or a\nproposal. To illustrate his point, Toelken employs Clarissa Pinkola Est\u00e9s's\n(1992) Women Who Run with the Wolves, citing its inaccurate representation of\nthe folklore record, and Campbell's \"monomyth\" approach as another. Regarding\nCampbell, Toelken writes, \"Campbell could construct a monomyth of the hero\nonly by citing those stories that fit his preconceived mold, and leaving out\nequally valid stories... which did not fit the pattern\". Toelken traces the\ninfluence of Campbell's monomyth theory into other then-contemporary popular\nworks, such as Robert Bly's Iron John: A Book About Men (1990), which he says\nsuffers from similar source selection bias.^[65]\n\nSimilarly, American folklorist Alan Dundes is highly critical of both\nCampbell's approach to folklore, designating him as a \"non-expert\" and\noutlining various examples of source bias in Campbell's theories, as well as\nmedia representation of Campbell as an expert on the subject of myth in\npopular culture. Dundes writes, \"Folklorists have had some success in\npublicising the results of our efforts in the past two centuries such that\nmembers of other disciplines have, after a minimum of reading, believe they\nare qualified to speak authoritatively of folkloristic matters. It seems that\nthe world is full of self-proclaimed experts in folklore, and a few, such as\nCampbell, have been accepted as such by the general public (and public\ntelevision, in the case of Campbell)\". According to Dundes, \"there is no\nsingle idea promulgated by amateurs that have done more harm to serious\nfolklore study than the notion of archetype\".^[66]\n\nAccording to Northup (2006), mainstream scholarship of comparative mythology\nsince Campbell has moved away from \"highly general and universal\" categories\nin general.^[67] This attitude is illustrated by Consentino (1998), who\nremarks \"It is just as important to stress differences as similarities, to\navoid creating a (Joseph) Campbell soup of myths that loses all local\nflavor.\"^[68] Similarly, Ellwood (1999) stated \"A tendency to think in generic\nterms of people, races ... is undoubtedly the profoundest flaw in mythological\nthinking.\"^[69]\n\nOthers have found the categories Campbell works with so vague as to be\nmeaningless and lacking the support required of scholarly argument: Crespi\n(1990), writing in response to Campbell's filmed presentation of his model,\ncharacterized it as \"unsatisfying from a social science perspective.\nCampbell's ethnocentrism will raise objections, and his analytic level is so\nabstract and devoid of ethnographic context that myth loses the very meanings\nsupposed to be embedded in the 'hero'.\"^[70]\n\nIn a similar vein, American philosopher John Shelton Lawrence and American\nreligious scholar Robert Jewett have discussed an \"American Monomyth\" in many\nof their books, The American Monomyth, The Myth of the American Superhero\n(2002), and Captain America and the Crusade Against Evil: The Dilemma of\nZealous Nationalism (2003). They present this as an American reaction to the\nCampbellian monomyth. The \"American Monomyth\" storyline is: \"A community in a\nharmonious paradise is threatened by evil; normal institutions fail to contend\nwith this threat; a selfless superhero emerges to renounce temptations and\ncarry out the redemptive task; aided by fate, his decisive victory restores\nthe community to its paradisiacal condition; the superhero then recedes into\nobscurity.\"^[71]\n\nThe monomyth has also been criticized for focusing on the masculine journey.\nThe Heroine's Journey (1990)^[72] by Maureen Murdock and From Girl to Goddess:\nThe Heroine's Journey Through Myth and Legend (2010) by Valerie Estelle\nFrankel both set out what they consider the steps of the female hero's\njourney, which is different from Campbell's monomyth.^[73] Likewise, The\nVirgin's Promise, by Kim Hudson, articulates an equivalent feminine journey,\nto parallel the masculine hero's journey, which concerns personal growth and\n\"creative, spiritual, and sexual awakening\" rather than an external\nquest.^[74]\n\nAccording to a 2014 interview between filmmaker Nicole L. Franklin and artist\nand comic book illustrator Alice Meichi Li, a hero's journey is \"the journey\nof someone who has privilege. Regardless of the protagonist is male or female,\na heroine does not start out with privilege.\" Being underprivileged, to Li,\nmeans that the heroine may not receive the same level of social support\nenjoyed by the hero in a traditional mythic cycle, and rather than return from\nher quest as both hero and mentor the heroine instead returns to a world in\nwhich she or he is still part of an oppressed demographic. Li adds, \"They're\nnot really bringing back an elixir. They're navigating our patriarchal society\nwith unequal pay and inequalities. In the final chapter, they may end up on\nequal footing. But when you have oppressed groups, all you can hope for is to\nget half as far by working twice as hard.\"^[75]\n\nIn a 1999 Salon article, science-fiction author David Brin criticized the\nmonomyth template as supportive of \"despotism and tyranny,\" indicating that he\nthinks modern popular fiction should strive to depart from it to support more\nprogressive values.^[76]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Mythology portal\n  * Literature portal\n\n### Other mythology[edit]\n\n  * Allegory of the Cave\n  * Dying-and-rising deity\n  * Gregory Nagy (professor of classics)\n  * How to Kill a Dragon (1995)\n  * The Myth of the Birth of the Hero (1909)\n  * The Pilgrim's Progress (1678)\n  * Vladimir Propp (Russian folklorist)\n\n### Narratology and writing instructions[edit]\n\n  * Dan Harmon's story circle\n  * Dramatic structure\n  * The Seven Basic Plots\n  * Vladimir Propp's Morphology of the Folk Tale\n  * The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure for Writers\n\n### Genres[edit]\n\n  * Bildungsroman\n  * Chivalric romance\n  * Heroic fantasy\n  * Kishu ry\u016britan\n  * Road movie\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c Singh, Manvir (July 2021). \"The Sympathetic Plot, Its Psychological Origins, and Implications for the Evolution of Fiction\".
