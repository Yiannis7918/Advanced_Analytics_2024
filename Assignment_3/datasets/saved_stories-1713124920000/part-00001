Despite how crucial it is, it's\nhard to find a service that has all the features you need for a successful\nproduct.\n\nThat's why we built Stack. It has components to get you right started, such as\n<SignIn />, <ForgotPassword />, <AccountSettings />, <EmailVerification />,\n<UserButton />, and hooks like useUser(). We are starting with support for\nNext.js and React components (RSC or RCC), but are going to expand soon.\n\nWhat's cool about Stack is that if you use a design system like MUI or shadcn,\nits components will automatically adapt to your theme. For example, below is a\nscreenshot of the same sign-in page with Radix UI, and then with Joy UI.\n\nAnd for the developers, you probably want an interface to manage your users,\ntoo. We provide you with a handy admin dashboard that shows an overview of\nyour users and lets you edit or delete them.\n\nIt really is that simple. The best part is that Stack is 100% open-source &\nself-hostable. You wouldn't want to grow your company with sweat and tears\nonly to see that your proprietary authentication vendor locked you in to raise\nprices.\n\nThat's not where it ends, of course. On our roadmap for the next few weeks, we\nhave the following items:\n\n  * Support for more frameworks\n  * SSO/SAML\n  * Passkeys, TOTP and two-factor authentication\n  * AuthZ and permission management\n  * Analytics integrations\n  * etc. etc.\n\nWe are on GitHub, please leave a star if you like the project. We also have a\nDiscord server, where we're more than happy to answer questions. If you'd like\nto get started in just 10 minutes, sign up on our dashboard.\n\nDeveloper friendly user authentication\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2024 Stack.
