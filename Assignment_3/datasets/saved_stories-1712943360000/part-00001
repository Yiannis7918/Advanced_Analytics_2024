If you have a background in finance or economics and\nnarrative skills to transform dry financial data into engaging stories, then\napply here.\n\nNow let's dive in.\n\n### The Story\n\nThe Supreme Court of India recently recognised a distinct fundamental right \u2014\nthe right against the adverse effects of climate change!\n\nAnd it\u2019s all thanks to one of India\u2019s most critically endangered birds.\n\nConfused?\n\nOkay, we\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s going on.\n\nSee, the Great Indian Bustard (or the Godawan) is the state bird of Rajasthan.\nIt\u2019s an ostrich-like creature that stands at ~4 feet tall and weighs 15 kilos.\nSo you can imagine it\u2019s not the most agile flying species. It\u2019s quite slow in\nflight and when it does fly, it keeps its eyes focused on the scrubland in the\ndesert.\n\nAnd that creates a big problem for the bird. Because it often misses the\nnewest predator in its habitat \u2014 Power lines!\n\nYup, the open lands of the Kutch and Thar deserts in western India that are\nhome to the bird are also perfect for wind and solar projects. And the\ntransmission lines carrying power crisscross across the region.\n\nNow the unfortunate reality of this situation is that Bustards often fly into\nthese lines and are killed. And even 1 such death is too many because there\nare less than 150 of them left in the wild. And as per estimates by the\nWildlife Institute of India (WII), even four power line-induced deaths a year\nwould lead to its extinction by 2040.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sound good, does it?\n\nEspecially since this bird is found only in our country and that too in a very\nconcentrated habitat.\n\nAnd a couple of years ago, even the Supreme Court thought so. It intervened\nwhen it realised the looming extinction threat to this majestic bird. And it\nasked companies involved in renewable energy projects to fix things. It wanted\nthem to move a large segment of their transmission lines in the region\nunderground. In other cases, it wanted them to install bird diverters. Think\nof these as bright circles that dangle from the power lines to create a\nvisually clearer warning of an object.\n\nBut the companies weren\u2019t happy. They said it would cost a mammoth $4 billion\nin additional expenses. And that it would hurt projects that were already\nawarded. All their calculations would have to be tossed in the bin and\nprojects wouldn\u2019t even make economic sense anymore.\n\nEven the government was displeased.\n\nWhy, you ask?\n\nWell, the government is banking on renewable energy in the country.\n\nYou see, Indians are using a lot more electricity than before. The per capita\nconsumption is rising at a fast clip. But unfortunately, 70% of our\nelectricity needs end up being fueled by coal. Now we don\u2019t need to explain to\nyou that coal is a dirty fossil fuel that spews a lot of harmful emissions\nduring its use. So you can\u2019t claim that it\u2019s environmentally friendly. Also,\nanother issue is that we end up importing truckloads of coal to meet our needs\n\u2014 we spent a gargantuan sum of nearly \u20b94 lakh crores last year on imports.\n\nSo by switching away from coal, we save costs. But there\u2019s also something\nelse.\n\nWe have sunlight in abundance and can simply tap into this free natural\nresource. Some reports say there\u2019s no other country in the G20 \u2014 which is an\ninformal organisation of some of the top 20 economies in the world \u2014 that\nreceives more sunlight than us. In this way, we get to fulfil the renewable\nenergy promises we\u2019ve made to the world while saving our valuable foreign\nexchange reserves too\n\nSo the government appealed to the court highlighting the importance of\nrenewable power from the region. It called it \u201cessential for meeting rising\npower demand...and...India\u2019s international commitments on climate change\u201d.\n\nAnd that prompted the Supreme Court to evaluate the situation again.\n\nThis time, it said, \u201cOkay, we might have gone overboard with our previous\ndiktat. Let\u2019s reconsider this because what we actually need is an approach\nwhich does not sacrifice either of the two at the altar of the other. We need\nto save the Great Indian Bustard and we need to meet our renewable energy\ngoals. So we\u2019ll set up a committee to decide what\u2019s the best way forward.\u201d\n\nNow we don\u2019t know what will be the outcome of that. All we can hope for is\nthat the committee comes up with a feasible plan to meet our twin objectives \u2014\nsaving the bird and meeting our renewable energy goals.\n\nBut amid this tussle, the Supreme Court also realised one other thing.\n\nThe reason why we\u2019re hellbent on renewable energy is because we\u2019re conscious\nabout climate change. We know that burning fossil fuels like there\u2019s no\ntomorrow will literally mean we end up with no tomorrow. Global warming will\nchange everything. Sea levels will rise and people in low-lying areas or the\ncoast will be affected. Warmer waters will affect fishing and consequently\nhurt the livelihoods of people who depend on fishing. Erratic weather will\nspoil crop production and farmers will suffer.\n\nNow we have Article 21 in the Constitution which gives us the \u2018Right to Life\u2019.\nAnd over the years, it has been expanded to include bits and pieces. For\ninstance, in 1995, the top court had said every Indian had a \u2018right to a clean\nenvironment.\u2019 under the Right to Life too.\n\nBut the problem was that the environment is often impacted by climate change.\nAnd in order to make the Right to Life more complete, we need to address\nclimate change too. Or rather, we need a \u201cright against the adverse effects of\nclimate change\u201d. It\u2019s as distinct a right as anything else.\n\nThat means we need to ensure that we have sustainable solutions that can help\ncombat climate change. And renewable energy could be one of them.\n\nSo yeah, that\u2019s how an endangered bird, the Great Indian Bustard, gave us a\nnew fundamental right. But now it\u2019s up to us to protect the bird\u2019s right to\nlife too.\n\nUntil then...\n\nDon't forget to share this story on WhatsApp, LinkedIn, and X.\n\n\ud83d\udce2Finshots is also on WhatsApp Channels.

Here's why:\n\n1) Low premiums, forever\n\nThe same 1Cr term insurance cover will cost you far less at 25 years than at\n35 years. And once these premiums are locked in, they remain the same\nthroughout the term!\n\nSo if you\u2019re planning on building a robust financial plan, consider buying\nterm insurance as early as you can.\n\n2) You might not realize that you still have dependents in your 20s\n\nMaybe your parents are about to retire in the next few years and funding your\nstudies didn't allow them to grow their investments\u2014 making you their sole\nbread earner once they age.\n\nAnd although no amount of money can replace you, it sure can give that added\nfinancial support in your absence.\n\n3) Tax saver benefit\n\nSection 80C of the Income Tax Act helps you cut down your taxable income by\nthe premiums paid. And what's better than saving taxes from early on in your\ncareer?\n\nSo maybe, it's time for you to buy yourself a term plan.
