However, by the time the company was ready to\nlaunch Rabbit to the world, the other three companies \u2014 Mercury Callpoint,\nFerranti\u2019s Zonephone and BT\u2019s Phonepoint \u2014 had already closed down.\n\nRabbit pushed on and, with a huge marketing blitz, finally started appearing\nin the shops in May 1992.\n\nDespite the fact that it could only make calls within 100 yards of a base\nstation and couldn\u2019t receive calls (you could get a pager telling you to call\nsomeone) \u2014 in theory, it should have been a success.\n\nAt the time, the two mobile networks were for business people and Yuppies, and\nwere very expensive to use, so even the restrictive Rabbit phones would have\nan edge as they were much cheaper to make calls on \u2013 typically 50p a minute on\na basic cellphone tariff vs 20p a minute on Rabbit. And cheaper monthly\nrentals.\n\nThe other factor is that the Rabbit phones could also be used at home.\n\nMany homes had a cordless phone, but these domestic analogue radio-based\ncordless phones were large and frankly pretty poor quality, with calls often\ndropping out. The Rabbit phones came with a home base station and used early\ndigital phone technologies, so the sound quality was considerably better. And\nthe handset was much smaller than the home cordless phone.\n\nSo, when Rabbit hopped into the shops in May 1992, sales were expected to be\nbrisk, and indeed, they were. Initially.\n\nI worked in a shop selling them, and from memory the mobile calling function\nwas only about half the appeal \u2014 it was the substantially better home phone\nfunction that really appealed to people when they heard about it from friends.\n\nRabbit launched with base stations on shop fronts and lamposts across\nManchester and quickly spread, reaching nationwide coverage by late 1993.\n\nThen it abruptly closed down.\n\nOn a day to remember, Friday 5th November, Hutchison Telecom suddenly\nannounced that it was shutting down the Rabbit service. Hutchison Telecom had\nrecently been granted a license to build a full mobile network and wasn\u2019t\ninterested in its old Telepoint based service anymore.\n\nCustomers who owned a Rabbit phone were given a refund, and a promise of a\ndiscount on Hutchison\u2019s replacement, a GSM based mobile phone network \u2014 Orange\n(now EE).\n\nThe bunny had flopped. The future was Orange.\n\nThe announcement that Rabbit was closing down sparked something totally\nunexpected \u2014 a surge in sales.\n\nRemember how I mentioned that the phones worked at home as a replacement for\nthe clunky cordless phone \u2014 well, that wasn\u2019t dependent on the Rabbit base\nstations, so the handsets would keep on working in the home after the mobile\nnetwork was shut down.\n\nAnd people really liked the Rabbit phone for their homes.\n\nAwkwardly, customers offered a refund had to return the handsets, and many\nchose not to, while shops were told to return unsold stock to the warehouses,\nand many chose not to.\n\nHutchison\u2019s attempt to kill the rabbit dead was struggling for life.\n\nIn the end, shops ran out of rabbit stock, and in December 1993, the Rabbit\nbase stations switched off forever.\n\nHowever, like many items of street furniture, what is installed in haste can\ntake ages to remove at leisure. Unless the location is needed for something\nelse, old signs and clutter can linger on for years, decades even.\n\nSo, inside Seven Sisters tube station, there\u2019s still a Rabbit base station\nsitting on the wall, more than 30 years after it last broadcast a radio\nsignal.\n\nIf you want to find the dead rabbit, just hop down to Seven Sisters tube\nstation\u2019s High Road entrance ticket hall. You can find it right next to the\nescalators to the Victoria line.\n\nThere\u2019s also another one, in rather better condition, in the waiting room on\nplatform 7/8 at Watford Junction station.\n\nNEWSLETTER\n\n\u2039 London\u2019s last unprotected cabmen\u2019s shelter gets heritage protection\n\nHoly Crispiness!

Terry Chipboard says:\n\n9 April 2024 at 8:01 am\n\nI\u2019ve often wondered what they were, but not enough to Google them.\n\nI\u2019ve been seeing these signs for years. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s loads of them still\naround.\n\nReply\n\n  2. alistair twin says:\n\n9 April 2024 at 9:49 am\n\nThe waiting room at watford doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s 32 years old. certainly\nbeen redecorated since then.\n\nReply\n\n  3.

ChrisC says:\n\n9 April 2024 at 10:15 am\n\nCould do with a wipedown with a damp rag!\n\nAny reason why it can\u2019t just be removed?\n\nReply\n\n     * Keith says:\n\n9 April 2024 at 10:24 am\n\nFrom the photo it looks like there may be some electronics inside the sign. In\nwhich case it would require someone to either completely remove the wiring, or\nmake it safe at the wall with a blank plate box or similar.\n\nProbably not worth the hassle or money to do the work, unless part of a wider\nrefurbishment of that area of the station. I suspect that stations have a lot\nof no longer used wiring that\u2019s been left in place as it would cost more to\nremove, assuming they knew what it was for in the first place.\n\n  5. Adam Denning says:\n\n9 April 2024 at 10:16 am\n\nWasn\u2019t Hutchinson\u2019s mobile company actually One2One, not Orange? They did\nmerge and form EE later (and being T-Mobile for a short while)\n\nReply\n\n     * ianVisits says:\n\n9 April 2024 at 3:52 pm\n\nNo.\n\n     * Adam Denning says:\n\n9 April 2024 at 4:31 pm\n\nYes, I\u2019m completely wrong!

Floated Orange in the 90s, sold their remaining stake off in the 00s\nthen got the band together again for the 3G license round, creating Three.\n\n  7. daveid76 says:\n\n9 April 2024 at 2:18 pm\n\nmore rabbit than Sainsbury\u2019s |(rabbitrabbitrabbitrabbit)\n\nReply\n\n  8.

After the initial mirth at the name now associated with\nanother product thought I was kidding. I remember them being introduced\nManchester where I was a student plus on stations \u2013 but always used pay phones\nmyself!\n\nReply\n\n  9. Rob Healy says:\n\n9 April 2024 at 5:47 pm\n\nThere used to be one opposite the old ticket office at North Acton station.\nHigh up on the pillar. I haven\u2019t worked at the station for a few years but\nit\u2019s probably still there.\n\nReply\n\n  10. Chris Rogers says:\n\n9 April 2024 at 5:53 pm\n\nAs others note, there were a fair few of these and other telepoint signs\naround until, well, a few years ago. I remember it all at the time. It was a\ngood example of how the technology \u2013 here, proper GSM cellular \u2013 that wins\ndoes so because it comes out of nowhere, fast, and overtakes what seems like a\nbetter bet. As for \u201cThe future [i]s Orange\u201d, the v/o artist for that firm\u2019s\nads for over 10 years \u2013 almost all its life \u2013 was Paul Vaughan, one of the top\n4 in the trade at the time (the others being Sean Barrett, Andrew Sachs and\nJohn Hedges).\n\nReply\n\n     * Steve Morton says:\n\n10 April 2024 at 9:53 am\n\nPaul Vaughan the voice you never forget from BBC Horizon and other\ndocumentaries.\n\n  11. Steve Morton says:\n\n10 April 2024 at 9:52 am\n\nI remember it well. A Rabbit phone and a pager was the EDC of the day. Someone\nwho wanted to talk to you would page you, you then found a base station and\ncalled them back!\n\nThey did offer good deals on Orange phones when they stopped the service. I\ngot a Nokia Orange phone, it would be a collectors item now!!\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nHome\n\n>> News\n\n>> History\n\n##### Keep up with ianVisits\n\n##### NEWSLETTER\n\n##### Latest five articles\n\n  * Ibrahim Mahama wraps the Barbican Art Centre in massive pink fabrics\n\n  * Jools Holland and a free light show to mark the National Gallery\u2019s 200th birthday\n\n  * Consultation into housing next to Hampton Court railway station\n\n  * Exploring Ranjit Singh: A warrior King\u2019s exhibition at the Wallace Collection\n\n  * There\u2019s now a range of London Underground themed craft beers\n\n##### London events calendar\n\nSun| Mon| Tue| Wed| Thur| Fri| Sat  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n31| 01| 02| 03| 04| 05| 06  \n07| 08| 09| 10| 11| 12| 13  \n14| 15| 16| 17| 18| 19| 20  \n21| 22| 23| 24| 25| 26| 27  \n28| 29| 30  \n  \n##### Article Categories\n\n  * Books\n  * History\n  * Churches\n  * Museums\n  * Architecture\n  * Pocket Parks\n  * Unbuilt London\n  * London Theatre\n  * Transport News\n  * London Exhibitions\n  * London Ticket Alert\n  * Alleys and Passages\n  * Day trips from London\n\n##### Menu links\n\n  * What's on in London\n  * London visitor guide\n  * London theatre tickets\n  * London news\n  * London museums\n  * Privacy\n\n\u00a9 ianVisits\n\n", "frontpage": true}
