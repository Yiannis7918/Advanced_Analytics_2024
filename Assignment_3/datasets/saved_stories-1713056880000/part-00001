All the geometrical\n> quantities needed for the construction are explicitly obtained, and examples\n> of some of the application of the formalism are given.\n\nComments:| 23 pages, 3 figures. Published in 1991, in Spanish. Translated into\nEnglish by Ribhu Paul. V2 has corrected typos. The authors have made no effort\nto update it nor its bibliography. We hope, however, that by making it\npublicly available it may be useful for students interested in learning the\n3+1 formalism of general relativity within the ADM formalism  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2210.10103 [gr-qc]  \n(or arXiv:2210.10103v2 [gr-qc] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2210.10103arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \nJournal reference:| Rev.
