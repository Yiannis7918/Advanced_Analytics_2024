Is this homework? Just someone\nidly wondering?Because the interesting thing about this question is (assuming\nthat the person knows what an icosahedron is, etc.) it should be solvable in\nsixty seconds by anyone who makes the least effort. If you don't already see\nit, you should try. Try what? Just take an icosahedron, color the vertices a\nlittle, see what happens. Here, I'll help you out, here's a view of part of\nthe end of an icosahedron, although I left out most of it. Try to color it\nwith 3 colors so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color, surely\nthat will be no harder than coloring the whole icosahedron.The explanation\nbelow is a little belabored, it's what OP would have discovered in seconds if\nthey had actually tried the exercise.Let's color the middle vertex, say\nblue.The five vertices around the edge can't be blue, they must be the other\ntwo colors, say red and green, and the two colors must alternate:Ooops,\nthere's no color left for the fifth vertex.The phrasing of the question, \u201chow\nmany\u201d makes the problem sound harder than it is: the answer is zero because we\ncan't even color half the icosahedron.If OP had even tried, even a little bit,\nthey could have discovered this. They didn't need to have had the bright idea\nof looking at a a partial icosahedron. They could have grabbed one of the\npictures from Wikipedia and started coloring the vertices. They would have\ngotten stuck the same way. They didn't have to try starting in the middle of\nmy diagram, starting at the edge works too: if the top vertex is blue, the\nthree below it must be green-red-green, and then the bottom two are forced to\nbe blue, which isn't allowed. If you just try it, you win immediately. The\nonly way to lose is not to play.Before the post was deleted I suggested in a\ncomment \u201cGive it a try, see what happens\u201d. I genuinely hoped this might be\nhelpful. I'll probably never know if it was.Like I said, I would love to know\nwhat was going on here. I think maybe this person could have used a dose of\nLower Mathematics.Just now I wondered for the first time: what would it look\nlike if I were to try to list the principles of Lower Mathematics? \u201cTry it and\nsee\u201d is definitely in the list.| Buy How to Solve Itfrom Bookshop.org (with\nkickback) (without kickback)  \n---  \n  \nThen I thought: How To Solve It has that sort of list and something like \u201ctry\nit and see\u201d is probably on it. So I took it off the shelf and found: \u201cDraw a\nfigure\u201d, \u201cIf you cannot solve the proposed problem\u201d, \u201cIs it possible to\nsatisfy the condition?\u201d. I didn't find anything called \u201cfuck around with it\nand see what you learn\u201d but it is probably in there under a different name, I\nhaven't read the book in a long time. To this important principle I would like\nto add \u201cfuck around with it and maybe you will stumble across the answer by\naccident\u201d as happened here.\n\nMathematics education is too much method, not enough heuristic.\n\n[Other articles in category /math] permanent link\n\n", "frontpage": true}
