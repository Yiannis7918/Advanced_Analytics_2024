He was\nworking as a farmer, raising chickens and tending a few apple trees on a small\nplot of land his grandfather had bought for him in Derry, New Hampshire. It\nwas a difficult time in his life. He had little money and few prospects. He\nhad dropped out of two colleges, Dartmouth and Harvard, without earning a\ndegree. He had been unsuccessful in a succession of petty jobs. He was sickly.\nHe had nightmares. His firstborn child, a son, had died of cholera at the age\nof three. His marriage was troubled. \u201cLife was peremptory,\u201d Frost would later\nrecall, \u201cand threw me into confusion.\u201d\n\nBut it was during those lonely years in Derry that he came into his own as a\nwriter and an artist. Something about farming\u2014the long, repetitive days, the\nsolitary work, the closeness to nature\u2019s beauty and carelessness\u2014inspired him.\nThe burden of labor eased the burden of life. \u201cIf I feel timeless and immortal\nit is from having lost track of time for five or six years there,\u201d he would\nwrite of his stay in Derry. \u201cWe gave up winding clocks. Our ideas got untimely\nfrom not taking newspapers for a long period. It couldn\u2019t have been more\nperfect if we had planned it or foreseen what we were getting into.\u201d In the\nbreaks between chores on the farm, Frost somehow managed to write most of the\npoems for his first book, A Boy\u2019s Will; about half the poems for his second\nbook, North of Boston; and a good number of other poems that would find their\nway into subsequent volumes.\n\n\u201cMowing,\u201d from A Boy\u2019s Will, was the greatest of his Derry lyrics. It was the\npoem in which he found his distinctive voice: plainspoken and conversational,\nbut also sly and dissembling. (To really understand Frost\u2014to really understand\nanything, including yourself\u2014requires as much mistrust as trust.) As with many\nof his best works, \u201cMowing\u201d has an enigmatic, almost hallucinatory quality\nthat belies the simple and homely picture it paints\u2014in this case of a man\ncutting a field of grass for hay. The more you read the poem, the deeper and\nstranger it becomes:\n\n> There was never a sound beside the wood but one, And that was my long scythe\n> whispering to the ground. What was it it whispered? I knew not well myself;\n> Perhaps it was something about the heat of the sun, Something, perhaps,\n> about the lack of sound\u2014 And that was why it whispered and did not speak. It\n> was no dream of the gift of idle hours, Or easy gold at the hand of fay or\n> elf: Anything more than the truth would have seemed too weak To the earnest\n> love that laid the swale in rows, Not without feeble-pointed spikes of\n> flowers (Pale orchises), and scared a bright green snake. The fact is the\n> sweetest dream that labor knows. My long scythe whispered and left the hay\n> to make.\n\nWe rarely look to poetry for instruction anymore, but here we see how a poet\u2019s\nscrutiny of the world can be more subtle and discerning than a scientist\u2019s.\nFrost understood the meaning of the mental state we now call \u201cflow\u201d long\nbefore psychologists and neurobiologists delivered the empirical evidence. His\nmower is not an airbrushed peasant, a rustic caricature. He\u2019s a farmer, a man\ndoing a hard job on a still, hot summer day. He\u2019s not dreaming of \u201cidle hours\u201d\nor \u201ceasy gold.\u201d His mind is on his work\u2014the bodily rhythm of the cutting, the\nweight of the tool in his hands, the stalks piling up around him. He\u2019s not\nseeking some greater truth beyond the work. The work is the truth.\n\n> The fact is the sweetest dream that labor knows.\n\nThere are mysteries in that line. Its power lies in its refusal to mean\nanything more or less than what it says. But it seems clear that what Frost is\ngetting at, in the line and in the poem, is the centrality of action to both\nliving and knowing. Only through work that brings us into the world do we\napproach a true understanding of existence, of \u201cthe fact.\u201d It\u2019s not an\nunderstanding that can be put into words. It can\u2019t be made explicit. It\u2019s\nnothing more than a whisper. To hear it, you need to get very near its source.\nLabor, whether of the body or the mind, is more than a way of getting things\ndone. It\u2019s a form of contemplation, a way of seeing the world face-to-face\nrather than through a glass. Action un-mediates perception, gets us close to\nthe thing itself. It binds us to the earth, Frost implies, as love binds us to\none another. The antithesis of transcendence, work puts us in our place.\n\nFrost is a poet of labor. He\u2019s always coming back to those revelatory moments\nwhen the active self blurs into the surrounding world\u2014when, as he would write\nin another poem, \u201cthe work is play for mortal stakes.\u201d Richard Poirier, in his\nbook Robert Frost: The Work of Knowing, described with great sensitivity the\npoet\u2019s view of the essence and essentialness of hard work: \u201cAny intense labor\nenacted in his poetry, like mowing or apple-picking, can penetrate to the\nvisions, dreams, myths that are at the heart of reality, constituting its\narticulate form for those who can read it with a requisite lack of certainty\nand an indifference to merely practical possessiveness.\u201d The knowledge gained\nthrough such efforts may be as shadowy and elusive as a dream, but \u201cin its\nmythic propensities, the knowledge is less ephemeral than are the apparently\nmore practical results of labor, like food or money.\u201d\n\nWhen we embark on a task, with our bodies or our minds, on our own or\nalongside others, we usually have a practical goal in sight. Our eyes are\nlooking ahead to the product of our work\u2014a store of hay for feeding livestock,\nperhaps. But it\u2019s through the work itself that we come to a deeper\nunderstanding of ourselves and our situation. The mowing, not the hay, is what\nmatters most.\n\n* * *\n\nFrost is not romanticizing some distant, pre-technological past. Although he\nwas dismayed by those who allowed themselves to become \u201cbigoted in reliance /\nOn the gospel of modern science,\u201d he felt a kinship with scientists and\ninventors. As a poet, he shared with them a common spirit and pursuit. They\nwere all explorers of the mysteries of earthly life, excavators of meaning\nfrom matter. They were all engaged in work that, as Poirier described it, \u201ccan\nextend the capability of human dreaming.\u201d For Frost, the greatest value of\n\u201cthe fact\u201d\u2014whether apprehended in the world or expressed in a work of art or\nmade manifest in a tool or other invention\u2014lay in its ability to expand the\nscope of individual knowing and hence open new avenues of perception, action,\nand imagination. In the long poem \u201cKitty Hawk,\u201d written near the end of his\nlife, he celebrated the Wright brothers\u2019 flight \u201cInto the unknown, / Into the\nsublime.\u201d In making their own \u201cpass / At the infinite,\u201d the brothers also made\nthe experience of flight, and the sense of unboundedness it provides, possible\nfor all of us.\n\nTechnology is as crucial to the work of knowing as it is to the work of\nproduction. The human body, in its native, unadorned state, is a feeble thing.\nIt\u2019s constrained in its strength, its dexterity, its sensory range, its\ncalculative prowess, its memory. It quickly reaches the limits of what it can\ndo. But the body encompasses a mind that can imagine, desire, and plan for\nachievements the body alone can\u2019t fulfill. This tension between what the body\ncan accomplish and what the mind can envision is what gave rise to and\ncontinues to propel and shape technology. It\u2019s the spur for humankind\u2019s\nextension of itself and elaboration of nature. Technology isn\u2019t what makes us\n\u201cposthuman\u201d or \u201ctranshuman,\u201d as some writers and scholars these days suggest.\nIt\u2019s what makes us human. Technology is in our nature. Through our tools we\ngive our dreams form. We bring them into the world. The practicality of\ntechnology may distinguish it from art, but both spring from a similar,\ndistinctly human yearning.\n\nOne of the many jobs the human body is unsuited to is cutting grass. (Try it\nif you don\u2019t believe me.) What allows the mower to do his work, what allows\nhim to be a mower, is the tool he wields, his scythe. The mower is, and has to\nbe, technologically enhanced. The tool makes the mower, and the mower\u2019s skill\nin using the tool remakes the world for him. The world becomes a place in\nwhich he can act as a mower, in which he can lay the swale in rows. This idea,\nwhich on the surface may sound trivial or even tautological, points to\nsomething elemental about life and the formation of the self.\n\n\u201cThe body is our general means of having a world,\u201d wrote the French\nphilosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty in his 1945 masterwork Phenomenology of\nPerception. Our physical makeup\u2014the fact that we walk upright on two legs at a\ncertain height, that we have a pair of hands with opposable thumbs, that we\nhave eyes which see in a particular way, that we have a certain tolerance for\nheat and cold\u2014determines our perception of the world in a way that precedes,\nand then molds, our conscious thoughts about the world. We see mountains as\nlofty not because mountains are lofty but because our perception of their form\nand height is shaped by our own stature. We see a stone as, among other\nthings, a weapon because the particular construction of our hand and arm\nenables us to pick it up and throw it. Perception, like cognition, is\nembodied.\n\nIt follows that whenever we gain a new talent, we not only change our bodily\ncapacities, we change the world. The ocean extends an invitation to the\nswimmer that it withholds from the person who has never learned to swim. With\nevery skill we master, the world reshapes itself to reveal greater\npossibilities. It becomes more interesting, and being in it becomes more\nrewarding. This may be what Baruch Spinoza, the seventeenth-century Dutch\nphilosopher who rebelled against Ren\u00e9 Descartes\u2019 division of mind and body,\nwas getting at when he wrote, \u201cThe human mind is capable of perceiving a great\nmany things, and is the more capable, the more its body can be disposed in a\ngreat many ways.\u201d John Edward Huth, a physics professor at Harvard, testifies\nto the regeneration that attends the mastery of a skill. A decade ago,\ninspired by Inuit hunters and other experts in natural wayfinding, he\nundertook \u201ca self-imposed program to learn navigation through environmental\nclues.\u201d Through months of rigorous outdoor observation and practice, he taught\nhimself how to read the nighttime and daytime skies, interpret the movements\nof clouds and waves, decipher the shadows cast by trees. \u201cAfter a year of this\nendeavor,\u201d he recalled in a recent essay, \u201csomething dawned on me: the way I\nviewed the world had palpably changed. The sun looked different, as did the\nstars.\u201d Huth\u2019s enriched perception of the environment, gained through a kind\nof \u201cprimal empiricism,\u201d struck him as being \u201cakin to what people describe as\nspiritual awakenings.\u201d\n\nTechnology, by enabling us to act in ways that go beyond our bodily limits,\nalso alters our perception of the world and what the world signifies to us.\nTechnology\u2019s transformative power is most apparent in tools of discovery, from\nthe microscope and the particle accelerator of the scientist to the canoe and\nthe spaceship of the explorer, but the power is there in all tools, including\nthe ones we use in our everyday lives. Whenever an instrument allows us to\ncultivate a new talent, the world becomes a different and more intriguing\nplace, a setting of even greater opportunity. To the possibilities of nature\nare added the possibilities of culture. \u201cSometimes,\u201d wrote Merleau-Ponty, \u201cthe\nsignification aimed at cannot be reached by the natural means of the body. We\nmust, then, construct an instrument, and the body projects a cultural world\naround itself.\u201d The value of a well-made and well-used tool lies not only in\nwhat it produces for us but what it produces in us. At its best, technology\nopens fresh ground. It gives us a world that is at once more understandable to\nour senses and better suited to our intentions\u2014a world in which we\u2019re more at\nhome. Used thoughtfully and with skill, a tool becomes much more than a means\nof production or consumption. It becomes a means of experience. It gives us\nmore ways to lead rich and engaged lives.\n\nLook more closely at the scythe. It\u2019s a simple tool, but an ingenious one.\nInvented around 500 BC, by the Romans or the Gauls, it consists of a curved\nblade, forged of iron or steel, attached to the end of a long wooden pole, or\nsnath. The snath typically has, about halfway down its length, a small wooden\ngrip, or nib, that makes it possible to grasp and swing the implement with two\nhands. The scythe is a variation on the much older sickle, a similar but\nshort-handled cutting tool that was invented in the Stone Age and came to play\nan essential role in the early development of agriculture and, in turn, of\ncivilization. What made the scythe a momentous innovation in its own right is\nthat its long snath allowed a farmer or other laborer to cut grass at ground\nlevel while standing upright. Hay or grain could be harvested, or a pasture\ncleared, more quickly than before. Agriculture leaped forward.\n\nThe scythe enhanced the productivity of the worker in the field, but its\nbenefit went beyond what could be measured in yield. The scythe was a\ncongenial tool, far better suited to the bodily work of mowing than the sickle\nhad been. Rather than stooping or squatting, the farmer could walk with a\nnatural gait and use both his hands, as well as the full strength of his\ntorso, in his job. The scythe served as both an aid and an invitation to the\nskilled work it enabled. We see in its form a model for technology on a human\nscale, for tools that extend the productive capabilities of society without\ncircumscribing the individual\u2019s scope of action and perception. Indeed, as\nFrost makes clear in \u201cMowing,\u201d the scythe intensifies its user\u2019s involvement\nwith and apprehension of the world. The mower swinging a scythe does more, but\nhe also knows more. Despite outward appearances, the scythe is a tool of the\nmind as well as the body.\n\nNot all tools are so congenial. Some deter us from skilled action. The\ntechnologies of computerization and automation that hold such sway over us\ntoday rarely invite us into the world or encourage us to develop new talents\nthat enlarge our perceptions and expand our possibilities. They mostly have\nthe opposite effect. They\u2019re designed to be disinviting. They pull us away\nfrom the world. That\u2019s a consequence not only of prevailing design practices,\nwhich place ease and efficiency above all other concerns, but also of the fact\nthat, in our personal lives, the computer, particularly in the form of the\nsmartphone, has become a media device, its software painstakingly programmed\nto grab and hold our attention. As most people know from experience, the\ncomputer screen is intensely compelling, not only for the conveniences it\noffers but also for the many diversions it provides. There\u2019s always something\ngoing on, and we can join in at any moment with the slightest of effort. Yet\nthe screen, for all its enticements and stimulations, is an environment of\nsparseness\u2014fast-moving, efficient, clean, but revealing only a shadow of the\nworld.\n\nThat\u2019s true even of the most meticulously crafted simulations of space that we\nfind in virtual-reality applications such as games, architectural models,\nthree-dimensional maps, and the video-meeting tools used to mimic classrooms,\nconference rooms, and cocktail parties. Artificial renderings of space may\nprovide stimulation to our eyes and to a lesser degree our ears, but they tend\nto starve our other senses\u2014touch, smell, taste\u2014and greatly restrict the\nmovements of our bodies. A study of rodents, published in Science in 2013,\nindicated that the brain cells used in navigation are much less active when\nanimals make their way through computer-generated landscapes than when they\ntraverse the real world. \u201cHalf of the neurons just shut up,\u201d reported one of\nthe researchers, UCLA neurophysicist Mayank Mehta. He believes that the drop-\noff in mental activity likely stems from the lack of \u201cproximal\ncues\u201d\u2014environmental smells, sounds, and textures that provide clues to\nlocation\u2014in digital simulations of space. \u201cA map is not the territory it\nrepresents,\u201d the Polish philosopher Alfred Korzybski famously remarked, and a\ncomputer rendering is not the territory it represents either. When we enter\nthe virtual world, we\u2019re required to shed much of our body. That doesn\u2019t free\nus; it emaciates us.\n\nThe world in turn is made less meaningful. As we adapt to our streamlined\nenvironment, we render ourselves incapable of perceiving what the world offers\nits most ardent inhabitants. We travel blindfolded. The result is existential\nimpoverishment, as nature and culture withdraw their invitations to act and to\nperceive. The self can only thrive, can only grow, when it encounters and\novercomes \u201cresistance from surroundings,\u201d wrote the American pragmatist John\nDewey in Art as Experience. \u201cAn environment that was always and everywhere\ncongenial to the straightaway execution of our impulsions would set a term to\ngrowth as sure as one always hostile would irritate and destroy. Impulsion\nforever boosted on its forward way would run its course thoughtless, and dead\nto emotion.\u201d\n\nOurs may be a time of material comfort and technological wonder, but it\u2019s also\na time of aimlessness and gloom. During the first decade of this century, the\nnumber of Americans taking prescription drugs to treat depression or anxiety\nrose by nearly a quarter. One in five adults now regularly takes such\nmedications. Many also take sleep aids such as Ambien. The suicide rate among\nmiddle-age Americans increased by nearly 30 percent over the same ten years,\naccording to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nMore than 10 percent of American schoolchildren, and nearly 20 percent of high\nschool\u2013age boys, have been given a diagnosis of attention-\ndeficit/hyperactivity disorder, and two-thirds of that group take drugs like\nRitalin and Adderall to treat the condition. The current pandemic has only\nexacerbated the discontent.\n\nThe reasons for our malaise are many and only dimly understood. But one of\nthem may be that through the pursuit of a frictionless existence, we\u2019ve\nsucceeded in turning the landscape of our lives into a barren place. Drugs\nthat numb the nervous system provide a way to rein in our vital, animal\nsensorium, to shrink our being to a size that better suits our constricted\nenvirons.\n\n* * *\n\nFrost\u2019s sonnet also contains, as one of its many whispers, a warning about\ntechnology\u2019s ethical hazards. There\u2019s a brutality to the mower\u2019s scythe. It\nindiscriminately cuts down flowers\u2014those tender, pale orchises\u2014along with the\nstalks of grass. It frightens innocent animals, like the bright green snake.\nIf technology embodies our dreams, it also embodies other, less benign\nqualities in our makeup, such as our will to power and the arrogance and\ninsensitivity that accompany it. Frost returns to this theme a little later in\nA Boy\u2019s Will, in a second lyric about cutting hay, \u201cThe Tuft of Flowers.\u201d The\npoem\u2019s narrator comes upon a freshly mown field and, while following the\nflight of a passing butterfly with his eyes, discovers in the midst of the cut\ngrass a small cluster of flowers, \u201ca leaping tongue of bloom\u201d that \u201cthe scythe\nhad spared\u201d:\n\n> The mower in the dew had loved them thus, By leaving them to flourish, not\n> for us, Nor yet to draw one thought of us to him, But from sheer morning\n> gladness to the brim.\n\nWorking with a tool is never just a practical matter, Frost is telling us,\nwith characteristic delicacy. It always entails moral choices and has moral\nconsequences. It\u2019s up to us, as users and makers of tools, to humanize\ntechnology, to aim its cold blade wisely. That requires vigilance and care.\n\nThe scythe is still employed in subsistence farming in many parts of the\nworld. But it has no place on the modern farm, the development of which, like\nthe development of the modern factory, office, and home, has required ever-\nmore complex and efficient equipment. The threshing machine was invented in\nthe 1780s, the mechanical reaper appeared around 1835, the baler came a few\nyears after that, and the combine harvester began to be produced commercially\ntoward the end of the nineteenth century. The pace of technological advance\nhas only accelerated in the decades since, and today the trend is reaching its\nlogical conclusion with the computerization of agriculture. The working of the\nsoil, which Thomas Jefferson saw as the most vigorous and virtuous of\noccupations, is being off-loaded almost entirely to machines. Farmhands are\nbeing replaced by \u201cdrone tractors\u201d and other robotic systems that, using\nsensors, satellite signals, and software, plant seeds, fertilize and weed\nfields, harvest and package crops, and milk cows and tend other livestock. In\ndevelopment are robo-shepherds that guide flocks through pastures. Even if\nscythes still whispered in the fields of the industrial farm, no one would be\naround to hear them.\n\nThe congeniality of hand tools encourages us to take responsibility for their\nuse. Because we sense the tools as extensions of our bodies, parts of\nourselves, we have little choice but to be intimately involved in the ethical\nchoices they present. The scythe doesn\u2019t choose to slash or spare the flowers;\nthe mower does. As we become more expert in the use of a tool, our sense of\nresponsibility for it naturally strengthens. To the novice mower, a scythe may\nfeel like a foreign object in the hands; to the accomplished mower, hands and\nscythe become one thing. Talent tightens the bond between an instrument and\nits user. This feeling of physical and ethical entanglement doesn\u2019t have to go\naway as technologies become more complex. In reporting on his historic solo\nflight across the Atlantic in 1927, Charles Lindbergh spoke of his plane and\nhimself as if they were a single being: \u201cWe have made this flight across the\nocean, not I or it.\u201d The airplane was a complicated system encompassing many\ncomponents, but to a skilled pilot it still had the intimate quality of a hand\ntool. The love that lays the swale in rows is also the love that parts the\nclouds for the stick-and-rudder man.\n\nAutomation weakens the bond between tool and user not because computer-\ncontrolled systems are complex but because they ask so little of us. They hide\ntheir workings in secret code. They resist any involvement of the operator\nbeyond the bare minimum. They discourage the development of skillfulness in\ntheir use. Automation ends up having an anesthetizing effect. We no longer\nfeel our tools as parts of ourselves. In a renowned 1960 paper, \u201cMan-Computer\nSymbiosis,\u201d the psychologist and engineer J. C. R. Licklider described the\nshift in our relation to technology well. \u201cIn the man-machine systems of the\npast,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe human operator supplied the initiative, the direction,\nthe integration, and the criterion. The mechanical parts of the systems were\nmere extensions, first of the human arm, then of the human eye.\u201d The\nintroduction of the computer changed all that. \u201c\u2018Mechanical extension\u2019 has\ngiven way to replacement of men, to automation, and the men who remain are\nthere more to help than to be helped.\u201d The more automated everything gets, the\neasier it becomes to see technology as a kind of implacable, alien force that\nlies beyond our control and influence. Attempting to alter the path of its\ndevelopment seems futile. We press the on switch and follow the programmed\nroutine.\n\nTo adopt such a submissive posture, however understandable it may be, is to\nshirk our responsibility for managing progress. A robotic harvesting machine\nmay have no one in the driver\u2019s seat, but it is every bit as much a product of\nconscious human thought as a humble scythe is. We may not incorporate the\nmachine into our brain maps, as we do the hand tool, but on an ethical level\nthe machine still operates as an extension of our will. Its intentions are our\nintentions. If a robot scares a bright green snake (or worse), we\u2019re still to\nblame. We shirk a deeper responsibility as well: that of overseeing the\nconditions for the construction of the self. As computer systems and software\napplications come to play an ever-larger role in shaping our lives and the\nworld, we have an obligation to be more, not less, involved in decisions about\ntheir design and use\u2014before progress forecloses our options. We should be\ncareful about what we make.\n\nIf that sounds naive or hopeless, it\u2019s because we have been misled by a\nmetaphor. We\u2019ve defined our relation with technology not as that of body and\nlimb or even that of sibling and sibling but as that of master and slave. The\nidea goes way back. It took hold at the dawn of Western philosophical thought,\nemerging first with the ancient Athenians. Aristotle, in discussing the\noperation of households at the beginning of his Politics, argued that slaves\nand tools are essentially equivalent, the former acting as \u201canimate\ninstruments\u201d and the latter as \u201cinanimate instruments\u201d in the service of the\nmaster of the house. If tools could somehow become animate, Aristotle posited,\nthey would be able to substitute directly for the labor of slaves. \u201cThere is\nonly one condition on which we can imagine managers not needing subordinates,\nand masters not needing slaves,\u201d he mused, anticipating the arrival of\ncomputer automation and even machine learning. \u201cThis condition would be that\neach [inanimate] instrument could do its own work, at the word of command or\nby intelligent anticipation.\u201d It would be \u201cas if a shuttle should weave\nitself, and a plectrum should do its own harp-playing.\u201d\n\nThe conception of tools as slaves has colored our thinking ever since. It\ninforms society\u2019s recurring dream of emancipation from toil. \u201cAll\nunintellectual labour, all monotonous, dull labour, all labour that deals with\ndreadful things, and involves unpleasant conditions, must be done by\nmachinery,\u201d wrote Oscar Wilde in 1891. \u201cOn mechanical slavery, on the slavery\nof the machine, the future of the world depends.\u201d John Maynard Keynes, in a\n1930 essay, predicted that mechanical slaves would free humankind from \u201cthe\nstruggle for subsistence\u201d and propel us to \u201cour destination of economic\nbliss.\u201d In 2013, Mother Jones columnist Kevin Drum declared that \u201ca robotic\nparadise of leisure and contemplation eventually awaits us.\u201d By 2040, he\nforecast, our computer slaves\u2014\u201cthey never get tired, they\u2019re never ill-\ntempered, they never make mistakes\u201d\u2014will have rescued us from labor and\ndelivered us into a new Eden. \u201cOur days are spent however we please, perhaps\nin study, perhaps playing video games. It\u2019s up to us.\u201d\n\nWith its roles reversed, the metaphor also informs society\u2019s nightmares about\ntechnology. As we become dependent on our technological slaves, the thinking\ngoes, we turn into slaves ourselves. From the eighteenth century on, social\ncritics have routinely portrayed factory machinery as forcing workers into\nbondage. \u201cMasses of labourers,\u201d wrote Marx and Engels in their Communist\nManifesto, \u201care daily and hourly enslaved by the machine.\u201d Today, people\ncomplain all the time about feeling like slaves to their appliances and\ngadgets. \u201cSmart devices are sometimes empowering,\u201d observed The Economist in\n\u201cSlaves to the Smartphone,\u201d an article published in 2012. \u201cBut for most people\nthe servant has become the master.\u201d More dramatically still, the idea of a\nrobot uprising, in which computers with artificial intelligence transform\nthemselves from our slaves to our masters, has for a century been a central\ntheme in dystopian fantasies about the future. The very word \u201crobot,\u201d coined\nby a science fiction writer in 1920, comes from robota, a Czech term for\nservitude.\n\nThe master-slave metaphor, in addition to being morally fraught, distorts the\nway we look at technology. It reinforces the sense that our tools are separate\nfrom ourselves, that our instruments have an agency independent of our own. We\nstart to judge our technologies not on what they enable us to do but rather on\ntheir intrinsic qualities as products\u2014their cleverness, their efficiency,\ntheir novelty, their style. We choose a tool because it\u2019s new or it\u2019s cool or\nit\u2019s fast, not because it brings us more fully into the world and expands the\nground of our experiences and perceptions. We become mere consumers of\ntechnology.\n\nThe metaphor encourages society to take a simplistic and fatalistic view of\ntechnology and progress. If we assume that our tools act as slaves on our\nbehalf, always working in our best interest, then any attempt to place limits\non technology becomes hard to defend. Each advance grants us greater freedom\nand takes us a stride closer to, if not utopia, then at least the best of all\npossible worlds. Any misstep, we tell ourselves, will be quickly corrected by\nsubsequent innovations. If we just let progress do its thing, it will find\nremedies for the problems it creates. \u201cTechnology is not neutral but serves as\nan overwhelming positive force in human culture,\u201d writes one pundit,\nexpressing the self-serving Silicon Valley ideology that in recent years has\ngained wide currency. \u201cWe have a moral obligation to increase technology\nbecause it increases opportunities.\u201d The sense of moral obligation strengthens\nwith the advance of automation, which, after all, provides us with the most\nanimate of instruments, the slaves that, as Aristotle anticipated, are most\ncapable of releasing us from our labors.\n\nThe belief in technology as a benevolent, self-healing, autonomous force is\nseductive. It allows us to feel optimistic about the future while relieving us\nof responsibility for that future. It particularly suits the interests of\nthose who have become extraordinarily wealthy through the labor-saving,\nprofit-concentrating effects of automated systems and the computers that\ncontrol them. It provides our new plutocrats with a heroic narrative in which\nthey play starring roles: job losses may be unfortunate, but they\u2019re a\nnecessary evil on the path to the human race\u2019s eventual emancipation by the\ncomputerized slaves that our benevolent enterprises are creating. Peter Thiel,\na successful entrepreneur and investor who has become one of Silicon Valley\u2019s\nmost prominent thinkers, grants that \u201ca robotics revolution would basically\nhave the effect of people losing their jobs.\u201d But, he hastens to add, \u201cit\nwould have the benefit of freeing people up to do many other things.\u201d Being\nfreed up sounds a lot more pleasant than being fired.\n\nThere\u2019s a callousness to such grandiose futurism. As history reminds us, high-\nflown rhetoric about using technology to liberate workers often masks a\ncontempt for labor. It strains credulity to imagine today\u2019s technology moguls,\nwith their libertarian leanings and impatience with government, agreeing to\nthe kind of vast wealth-redistribution scheme that would be necessary to fund\nthe self-actualizing leisure-time pursuits of the jobless multitudes. Even if\nsociety were to come up with some magic spell, or magic algorithm, for\nequitably parceling out the spoils of automation, there\u2019s good reason to doubt\nwhether anything resembling the \u201ceconomic bliss\u201d imagined by Keynes would\nensue.\n\nIn a prescient passage in The Human Condition, Hannah Arendt observed that if\nautomation\u2019s utopian promise were actually to pan out, the result would\nprobably feel less like paradise than like a cruel practical joke. The whole\nof modern society, she wrote, has been organized as \u201ca laboring society,\u201d\nwhere working for pay, and then spending that pay, is the way people define\nthemselves and measure their worth. Most of the \u201chigher and more meaningful\nactivities\u201d revered in the distant past have been pushed to the margin or\nforgotten, and \u201conly solitary individuals are left who consider what they are\ndoing in terms of work and not in terms of making a living.\u201d For technology to\nfulfill humankind\u2019s abiding \u201cwish to be liberated from labor\u2019s \u2018toil and\ntrouble\u2019 \u201d at this point would be perverse. It would cast us deeper into a\npurgatory of malaise. What automation confronts us with, Arendt concluded, \u201cis\nthe prospect of a society of laborers without labor, that is, without the only\nactivity left to them. Surely, nothing could be worse.\u201d Utopianism, she\nunderstood, is a form of self-delusion.\n\n* * *\n\nA while back, I had a chance meeting on the campus of a small, liberal arts\ncollege with a freelance photographer who was working on an assignment for the\nschool. He was standing under a tree, waiting for some uncooperative clouds to\nget out of the way of the sun. I noticed he had a large-format film camera set\nup on a bulky tripod\u2014it was hard to miss, as it looked almost absurdly old-\nfashioned\u2014and I asked him why he was still using film. He told me that he had\neagerly embraced digital photography a few years earlier. He had replaced his\nfilm cameras and his darkroom with digital cameras and a computer running the\nlatest image-processing software. But after a few months, he switched back. It\nwasn\u2019t that he was dissatisfied with the operation of the equipment or the\nresolution or accuracy of the images. It was that the way he went about his\nwork had changed.\n\nThe constraints inherent in taking and developing pictures on film\u2014the\nexpense, the toil, the uncertainty\u2014had encouraged him to work slowly when he\nwas on a shoot, with deliberation, thoughtfulness, and a deep, physical sense\nof presence. Before he took a picture, he would compose the shot in his mind,\nattending to the scene\u2019s light, color, framing, and form. He would wait\npatiently for the right moment to release the shutter. With a digital camera,\nhe could work faster. He could take a slew of images, one after the other, and\nthen use his computer to sort through them and crop and tweak the most\npromising ones. The act of composition took place after a photo was taken. The\nchange felt intoxicating at first. But he found himself disappointed with the\nresults. The images left him cold. Film, he realized, imposed a discipline of\nperception, of seeing, which led to richer, more artful, more moving\nphotographs. Film demanded more of him. And so he went back to the older\ntechnology.\n\nThe photographer wasn\u2019t the least bit antagonistic toward computers. He wasn\u2019t\nbeset by any abstract concerns about a loss of agency or autonomy. He wasn\u2019t a\ncrusader. He just wanted the best tool for the job\u2014the tool that would\nencourage and enable him to do his finest, most fulfilling work. What he came\nto realize is that the newest, most automated, most expedient tool is not\nalways the best choice. Although I\u2019m sure he would bristle at being likened to\nthe Luddites of the early nineteenth century, his decision to forgo the latest\ntechnology, at least in some stages of his work, was an act of rebellion\nresembling that of the old English machine-breakers, if without the fury. Like\nthe Luddites, he understood that decisions about technology are also decisions\nabout ways of working and ways of living\u2014and he took control of those\ndecisions rather than ceding them to others or giving way to the momentum of\nprogress. He stepped back and thought critically about technology.\n\nAs a society, we\u2019ve become suspicious of such acts. Out of ignorance or\nlaziness or timidity, we\u2019ve turned the Luddites into cartoon characters,\nemblems of backwardness. We assume that anyone who rejects a new tool in favor\nof an older one is guilty of nostalgia, of making choices sentimentally rather\nthan rationally. But the real sentimental fallacy is the assumption that the\nnew thing is always better suited to our purposes and intentions than the old\nthing. That\u2019s the view of a child, naive and pliable. What makes one tool\nsuperior to another has nothing to do with how new it is. What matters is how\nit enlarges us or diminishes us, how it shapes our experience of nature and\nculture and one another. To cede choices about the texture of our daily lives\nto a grand abstraction called progress is folly.\n\nTechnology is a pillar and a glory of civilization. But it is also a test that\nwe set for ourselves. It challenges us to think about what\u2019s important in our\nlives, to ask ourselves what human being means. Computerization, as it extends\nits reach into the most intimate spheres of our existence, raises the stakes\nof the test. We can allow ourselves to be carried along by the technological\ncurrent, wherever it may be taking us, or we can push against it. To resist\ninvention is not to reject invention. It\u2019s to humble invention, to bring\nprogress down to earth. \u201cResistance is futile,\u201d goes the glib Star Trek clich\u00e9\nbeloved by techies. But that\u2019s the opposite of the truth. Resistance is never\nfutile. If the source of our vitality is, as Emerson taught us, \u201cthe active\nsoul,\u201d then our highest obligation is to resist any force, whether\ninstitutional or commercial or technological, that would enfeeble or enervate\nthe active soul.\n\nOne of the most remarkable things about us is also one of the easiest to\noverlook: each time we collide with the real, we deepen our understanding of\nthe world and become more fully a part of it. While we\u2019re wrestling with a\nchallenge, we may be motivated by an anticipation of the ends of our labor,\nbut, as Frost saw, it\u2019s the work\u2014the means\u2014that makes us who we are.\nAutomation severs ends from means. It makes getting what we want easier, but\nit distances us from the work of knowing. As we transform ourselves into\ncreatures of the screen, we face an existential question: Does our essence\nstill lie in what we know, or are we now content to be defined by what we\nwant?\n\nThis essay is adapted from the book The Glass Cage, published by W.
