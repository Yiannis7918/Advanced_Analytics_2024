Its latest such decision is a complete overhaul of elements\nsurrounding the video player on the YouTube player, and netizens are not\nhappy.\n\nRelated\n\n##### YouTube is cramming Shorts in yet another place\n\nInfiltrating the video recommendations sidebar with a new carousel on the web\n\nRecently, we spotted YouTube a/b testing a new placement for the Shorts shelf\non the web, in the column of suggested videos to the right of the video\nplayer. Now, though, the entire video title, uploader info, and comments have\nshifted to the right, trading places with the video suggestions. YouTube has\njust shrunk all the pill-shaped buttons, text, and comments into the slender\ncolumn on the right, while recommended videos and the Shorts shelf we just\nmentioned now have a prominent spot right under the player.\n\nAs a result, even accessibility focused features like video transcripts and\ndescriptions are crammed in that tiny space. Switching to Theater mode in the\nplayer controls doesn\u2019t save you either \u2014 it just shifts the video info and\ncolumn of comments under the player, but still right-aligned with the\nrecommendations taking up most of the screen real estate.\n\n## YouTube viewers are not pleased\n\nThe new web UI\n\nThe new web UI is a drastic step away from the old one, and Twitter was\nunderstandably divided. On the one hand, some users appreciated how you could\nread and engage with the comments while watching the video without scrolling\ndown and hiding the video player. On the other hand, several users found the\nchange jarring and too dense, with a lot of wasted screen space on the sides.\n\nThe new UI is quite like the recent update to the app for smart TVs, but we\nthink the new design also represents an ideological shift at the company,\nprioritizing content engagement and user retention over community interactions\nthrough the comments. We reached out to YouTube for comment, and were informed\nthe new layout is a limited test to make reading comments easier while\nwatching videos on desktop.\n\nYouTube Help documentation for test features and experiments reveals this is\none of many layouts YouTube has dabbled with since February 20 this year.\nThankfully, this is still a test and given the overwhelming feedback from\nusers on Twitter, UI designers may need to go back to the drawing board with\nthis one.\n\nReaders like you help support Android Police.
