Instead it has\nopened the floodgates of intolerance and become a tool for exclusion\n\nShare\n\nIn the early 2000s, I decided to commit to feminism, so I joined a feminist\ncampaigning group, convinced I had found an organisation that would defend the\nrights of every woman equally. At the time, a national debate was raging: in\nthe name of la\u00efcit\u00e9 \u2013 or secularism \u2013 France was questioning Muslim\nschoolgirls\u2019 right to wear head coverings in secular state schools. In March\n2004, after months of debate, the French parliament voted through a ban on\nheadscarves in schools, outlawing \u201csymbols or clothing that conspicuously\ndemonstrate a pupil\u2019s religious affiliation\u201d.\n\nThat is when I realised that the decision was quite popular in feminist\ncircles, including the predominantly white group I was part of. Many white\nfeminists thought it was their mission to help emancipate Muslim women and\ngirls from a particular type of patriarchy tied to Islam. I quit the group. If\nMuslim women were enduring a specific form of patriarchal oppression, and\nreally had no agency or free will when it came to wearing the hijab \u2013 a view I\ndon\u2019t share \u2013 how would it help them to exclude them from schools and access\nto emancipatory knowledge?\n\nTo me, the preoccupation with the hijab seemed to be a condescending way of\nsingling out a mainly non-white group of females as if they were not affected\nby the same forms of patriarchy as other women. I took the view that we had to\nlisten to what women and girls wanted for themselves before explaining their\nexperience through the lens of cultural domination.\n\nThe 1905 law that first established the principle of la\u00efcit\u00e9 in France was\nabout guaranteeing freedom. It instituted the separation of church and state,\nthe free exercise of religion by French citizens , and respect for all\ncitizens before the law, regardless of belief. Secularism imposed neutrality\non the French state and on public institutions, but did not require personal\nneutrality from citizens.\n\nBut 2004 marked a significant shift in the understanding of the secularism\nprinciple, by requiring users of state schools to be neutral about religion,\nor at least discreet about their beliefs. Education was the only public\nservice to which the 2004 rule applied.\n\nIn a post-9/11 context of rising Islamophobia, the idea that Muslims\u2019\nvisibility had to be kept in check had entered mainstream French opinion, the\nmedia and the political class. Students ought to have been protected by the\npublic educational establishments they were attending, no matter how they\nchose to present themselves. But the principle of la\u00efcit\u00e9 had evolved to\ninclude the demand that individuals make their faith an entirely private\nmatter.\n\nMembers of the Hijabeuses women\u2019s football team Photograph: Giulia\nFrigieri/The Guardian\n\nWhile the 2004 law was framed as a ban on all \u201cconspicuous\u201d religious symbols,\nincluding large Christian crosses, in practice it was targeted at expressions\nof Islam. As such, it has, over the past 20 years, opened the door to the\npursuit of an unrelenting Islamophobia, embodied in a fixation on Muslim women\nand girls\u2019 appearance.\n\nIn 2023 the Macron government added a ban on the abaya (a long-sleeved dress\nof Middle Eastern origin) in state schools, without defining it, which has\nleft a lot of scope for schools to make arbitrary rulings. Telling the\ndifference between a long dress and an abaya is simply not possible. Many\nMuslim girls and women cover themselves with dresses sold in regular retail\nstores. So the same outfit can be deemed religious on a supposedly Muslim\ngirl, but acceptably neutral if worn by a non-Muslim. What is this if not\nracial profiling?\n\nBeyond schools, in 2011 it became illegal for anyone to cover their face in a\npublic place, a measure seen as targeting Muslim burqas. In 2016\nmunicipalities began to ban burkinis from public pools and beaches. An attempt\nto overturn that rule was struck down in the courts in 2022.\n\nHijab-wearing female athletes meanwhile, have been excluded from teams, banned\nfrom practising their sport, even from the 2024 Paris Olympics. Ironically,\nwhile French athletes will not be able to wear a hijab in their own country,\nInternational Olympic Committee rules will allow women from other countries to\ncompete in hijabs.\n\nPrivately-owned businesses are not, like the public sector, bound by\nsecularism rules. But such is the confusion that many act as if they are, as a\ncontroversy which blew up this week over the treatment of a hijab-wearing\ntemporary employee at a shoe store in Strasbourg demonstrated. La\u00efcit\u00e9,\nconceived to protect freedom, has become a tool for harassment, humiliation\nand exclusion.\n\nSuch patronising of women of colour and their supposed \u201csubmission\u201d can be\ntraced to the French colonial era. Public unveiling ceremonies of colonised\nAlgerian women were organised by the military in the 1950s to promote\n\u201cassimilation\u201d and even \u201ccivilization\u201d. Unveiling the women was a way of\nasserting control over both the colony and the bodies of the colonised people.\n\nIn the post-#MeToo era, measures that encroach upon women\u2019s bodily autonomy\nwarrant unequivocal condemnation. Women should be free to choose how they\npresent their bodies, whether they opt to cover them up or not.\n\nBut the desire to track markers of religiosity reflects an intolerance of\nMuslims that goes beyond the targeting of women. Beards have been challenged,\nand a Muslim man had his application to join the police rejected because of\nhis tab\u00e2a (a mark on the forehead from the regular practice of prayer). More\nrecently, the French football federation ruled that players on the national\nteam are no longer allowed to fast during Ramadan.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to This is Europe\n\nFree weekly newsletter\n\nThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to\neconomics to the environment\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Carlo Bollo/Alamy\n\nThe message to all Muslims is clear: assimilate or stay out of the public\nsphere. It is no great surprise that an increasing number of Muslim\nindividuals are voting with their feet and opting to leave France.\n\nThe principal of a high school in Paris quit the job recently after receiving\nonline death threats following an altercation with a student who had been\nasked to remove her veil. The student, who was over 18, countered with an\naccusation of physical assault, which prosecutors dismissed. The prime\nminister Gabriel Attal then intervened to say the state would sue the student\nfor falsely accusing the head teacher of mistreatment.\n\nIt is an indictment of the headscarf ban and the wider intolerance of Muslim\ndress it ushered in, that 20 years on, schools are still struggling with\nenforcement. The measure is perceived as discriminatory by many Muslims, and\nrepeatedly fuels tensions to the point of necessitating government\nintervention. Even on its own terms, it is a blatant failure.\n\nThe positive news is that Muslims, and especially Muslim women, have, in the\npast 20 years found their own ways to resist, creating organisations such as\nLallab, which challenges narratives about Muslim women; Mamans Toutes Egales\n(Mums Are All Equal) which supports hijab-wearing mothers to be involved in\ntheir children\u2019s school lives; and Les hijabeuses, a hijab-wearing women\u2019s\nsoccer team.\n\nLuckily, younger generations tend to reject the way that the principle of\nla\u00efcit\u00e9 has been perverted. Let us hope they can build a future that is\ninclusive and welcoming for every citizen \u2013 whatever they choose to place on\ntheir heads. Only when this is achieved will we have an authentically secular\nFrench state and a free society.\n\n  * Rokhaya Diallo is a French journalist, writer, film-maker and activist.
