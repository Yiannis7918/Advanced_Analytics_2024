It originated from the merger of a neutron star with an\nunknown compact object, most likely an unusually light-weight black hole. With\na mass of only a few times that of our Sun, the object falls into the \u201clower\nmass gap\u201d between the heaviest neutron stars and the lightest black holes.\nResearchers at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics contributed\nto the discovery with accurate waveform models, new data-analysis methods, and\nsophisticated detector technology. Although this particular event was observed\nonly because of its gravitational waves, it increases the expectation that\nmore such events will also be observed with electromagnetic waves in the\nfuture.\n\nInspiral of a lower mass-gap black hole (dark gray surface) and a neutron star\n(orange sphere).

Dietrich (Potsdam University and Max\nPlanck Institute for Gravitational Physics), H. Pfeiffer, A. Buonanno (Max\nPlanck Institute for Gravitational Physics)\n\nFor about 30 years, researchers have debated whether there is a mass gap\nseparating the heaviest neutron stars from the lightest black holes. Now, for\nthe first time, scientists have found an object whose mass falls right into\nthis gap, which was thought to be almost empty. \u201cThese are very exciting times\nfor gravitational-wave research as we delve into realms that promise to\nreshape our theoretical understanding of astrophysical phenomena dominated by\ngravity,\u201d says Alessandra Buonanno, Director at the Max Planck Institute for\nGravitational Physics in Potsdam Science Park.\n\nEinstein's theory of general relativity predicts neutron stars to be lighter\nthan three times the mass of our Sun. However, the exact value of the maximum\nmass that a neutron star can have before collapsing into a black hole is\nunknown. \u201cConsidering electromagnetic observations and our present grasp of\nstellar evolution, there were expected to be very few black holes or neutron\nstars within the range of three to five solar masses. However, the mass of one\nof the newly discovered objects precisely aligns with this range,\u201d Buonanno\nelaborates.\n\nIn recent years, astronomers have uncovered several objects whose masses\npotentially fit within this elusive gap. In the case of GW190814, LIGO and\nVirgo identified an object at the lower boundary of the mass spectrum.\nHowever, the compact object detected via the gravitational-wave signal\nGW230529 marks the first instance where its mass unequivocally falls within\nthis gap.\n\n## New observing run with more sensitive detectors and improved search methods\n\nThe highly successful third observing run of the gravitational-wave detectors\nended in spring 2020, bringing the number of known gravitational-wave events\nto 90. Before the start of the fourth observing run on May 24, 2023, the\nresearchers made several improvements to the detectors to increase their\nsensitivity.\n\n\u201cResearchers at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert\nEinstein Institute) in Hannover, together with LIGO colleagues, have improved\nthe laser sources of the LIGO detectors at the heart of the instruments,\u201d\nexplains Karsten Danzmann, Director at the Albert Einstein Institute and\nDirector of the Institute for Gravitational Physics at Leibniz University\nHannover. \u201cThey provide high-precision laser light with an output power of up\nto 125 watts, with the same characteristics over very short and very long time\nscales.\u201d Benno Willke, leader of the laser development group at the Albert\nEinstein Institute Hannover, adds: \u201cThe reliability and performance of the new\nsolid-state laser amplifiers is amazing and I'm convinced that they will still\nbe used in the next detector upgrade.\u201d\n\nBut not only the hardware has been improved: the new observing run took\nadvantage of an efficient waveform code infrastructure, and the accuracy,\nspeed, and physical content of the waveform models developed at the Albert\nEinstein Institute Potsdam were improved, so that black-hole properties can be\nextracted in a few days.\n\n## Fourth observing run starts with a bang\n\nJust five days after the launch of the fourth observing run, things got really\nexciting: on May 29, 2023, the LIGO Livingston detector observed a\ngravitational wave that was published within minutes as signal candidate\n\u201cS230529ay\u201d. The result of this \u201conline analysis\u201d, which was performed almost\nin real time as the signal arrived, was that a neutron star and a black hole\nmost likely merged about 650 million light-years from Earth. However, it is\nnot possible to say exactly where the merger took place because only one\ngravitational-wave detector was recording scientific data at the time of the\nsignal. Therefore, the direction from which the gravitational waves came could\nnot be determined.\n\nThe researchers made sure that the signal was not a local disturbance in the\nLIGO Livingston detector, but actually came from deep space. \u201cAmong other\nthings, we examined all the perturbations and random fluctuations of detector\nnoise that resemble weak signals,\u201d explains Frank Ohme, leader of a Max Planck\nresearch group at the Albert Einstein Institute Hannover. \u201cGW230529 clearly\nstands out from this background and was consistently detected by several\nindependent search methods. This clearly indicates an astrophysical origin of\nthe signal.\u201d\n\nThe astrophysicists also used GW230529 to test Einstein's general theory of\nrelativity. \u201cGW230529 is in perfect agreement with the predictions of\nEinstein's theory,\u201d says Elise S\u00e4nger, a graduate student at the Albert\nEinstein Institute Potsdam who was involved in the study. \u201cIt provided some of\nthe best constraints to date on alternative theories of gravity using LVK\ngravitational-wave events.\u201d\n\n## GW230529: Neutron star meets unknown compact object\n\nYou can find this video on YouTube.

Whether these compact objects are neutron stars or black holes\ncannot be determined with certainty from gravitational-wave analysis alone.\nHowever, based on all the known properties of the binary, astronomers believe\nthat the lighter object is a neutron star and the heavier is a black hole.\n\nThe mass of the heavier object therefore lies confidently in the mass gap,\nwhich was previously thought to be mostly empty. None of the previous\ncandidates for objects in this mass range have been identified with the same\ncertainty.\n\n## Scientists expect more observations of similar signals\n\nOf all the neutron star-black hole mergers observed to date, GW230529 is the\none in which the masses of the two objects are the least different. Tim\nDietrich, a professor at the University of Potsdam and leader of a Max Planck\nFellow group at the Albert Einstein Institute, explains: \u201cIf the black hole is\nsignificantly heavier than the neutron star, no matter is left outside the\nblack hole after the merger, and no electromagnetic radiation is emitted.\nLighter black holes, on the other hand, can rip apart the neutron star with\ntheir stronger tidal forces, ejecting matter that can glow as a kilonova or a\ngamma-ray burst\u201d.\n\nThe observation of such an unusual system shortly after the start of the\nfourth observing run also suggests that further observations of similar\nsignals can be expected. The researchers have calculated how often such pairs\nmerge and found that these events occur at least as often as the previously\nobserved mergers of neutron stars with heavier black holes. Therefore, an\nafterglow in the electromagnetic spectrum should be observed more frequently\nthan previously thought.\n\nscientists can only make an educated guess as to how the heavier of the\ncompact objects \u2013 most likely a lightweight black hole \u2013 in the binary that\nemitted GW230529 was formed. It is too light to be the direct product of a\nsupernova. It is possible \u2013 but unlikely \u2013 that it was formed during a\nsupernova, where material initially ejected in the explosion falls back and\ncauses the newly formed black hole to grow. It is even less likely that the\nblack hole was formed in the merger of two neutron stars. An origin as a\nprimordial black hole in the early days of the universe is also possible, but\nnot very likely. Finally, the researchers cannot completely rule out the\npossibility that the heavier object is not a light black hole, but an\nextremely heavy neutron star.\n\n## The fourth observing run continues\n\nSo far, a total of 81 significant signal candidates have been identified in\nthe first half of the fourth observing run. GW230529 is the first of these\nthat has now been published after detailed investigation. After a\ncommissioning break of several weeks and a subsequent engineering run, the\nsecond half of O4, begins on April 10. Both LIGO detectors, Virgo, and GEO600,\nwill participate in the second half of the run.\n\nWhile the observing run continues, researchers are analyzing the observational\ndata from O4a and checking the remaining 80 significant signal candidates that\nhave already been identified. The sensitivity of the detectors should be\nslightly increased after the break. By the end of the fourth observing run in\nFebruary 2025, a similar number of new candidates are expected to be added,\nand the total number of observed gravitational-wave signals will soon exceed\n200.\n\n## Gravitational-wave observatories\n\nLIGO is funded by the NSF, and operated by Caltech and MIT, which conceived\nand built the project.
