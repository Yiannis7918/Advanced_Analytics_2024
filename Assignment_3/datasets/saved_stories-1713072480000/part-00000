But, as Ars has reported before,\nthe root cause of shortages of low-cost, off-patent generic drugs is well\nestablished. These drugs have razor-thin to non-existent profit margins,\ndriven by middle managers who have, in recent years, pushed down wholesale\nprices to rock-bottom levels. In some cases, generic manufacturers lose money\non the drugs, disincentivizing other players in the pharmaceutical industry\nfrom stepping in to bolster fragile supply chains. Several generic\nmanufacturers have filed for bankruptcy recently.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor other drugs, the situation is more complicated. The ADHD drug Adderall,\nfor instance, has been in critical shortage since October 2022, causing\nmillions of patients around the country to struggle to fill their\nprescriptions. It began when a manufacturing delay for one manufacturer kicked\noff a shortfall. Although that problem has since been resolved, it came amid a\nsignificant increase in Adderall prescriptions, which spiked further during\nthe pandemic when telehealth prescribing became more common. Additionally,\nbecause Adderall\u2014made of amphetamine-mixed salts\u2014is a controlled substance,\nthe Drug Enforcement Administration sets limits or \"quotas\" on how much of it\nmanufacturers can make. Such quotas can exacerbate shortages, ASHP said.\n\nBut, in a joint letter with the Food and Drug Administration last August, the\nDEA said that, by its data, manufacturers of amphetamine products (including\nAdderall) only sold approximately 70 percent of their allotted quotas in 2022.\nThat meant that there were approximately 1 billion more doses that they could\nhave produced but did not make or ship. At the time, the agencies said its\n2023 data was trending in the same direction.\n\nIn 60 percent of cases, manufacturers do not know or do not provide reasons\nwhy their drugs fall into short supply, ASHP found.\n\nThe organization has put forth policy recommendations to prevent shortages and\nimprove supply chains, advocating for federal and regulatory changes. \"Much\nwork remains to be done at the federal level to fix the root causes of drug\nshortages,\" Abramowitz said. \"ASHP will continue to engage with policymakers\nregularly as we guide efforts to draft and pass new legislation to address\ndrug shortages and continue to strongly advocate on behalf of our members for\nsolutions that work.\"\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How The Callisto Protocol's Gameplay Was Perfected Months Before Release\n\n#### reader comments\n\n139\n\nBeth Mole Beth is Ars Technica\u2019s Senior Health Reporter.
