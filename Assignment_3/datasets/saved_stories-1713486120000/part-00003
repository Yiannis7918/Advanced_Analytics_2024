So asserted Katie Neeves, biological male\nturned transgender female and founder of Cool to be Trans, on the BBC\u2019s World\nat One last Tuesday, responding to a long string of tweets the previous\nevening by J. K. Rowling. These comprised pictures of ten high-profile trans\nindividuals, followed by the comment, \u201cobviously, the people mentioned ...\naren\u2019t women at all\u201d, but \u201cmen performing their idea of femaleness\u201d.\n\nWhere is the hatred in that? In part, Neeves argued, because Rowling had\n\u201cimplied that all trans people are sex offenders\u201d by putting the latter at the\ntop of her list. Yet, the very first person listed was not an offender at all\nand nor were most of the rest. And later in the string, she explicitly said\nthat most trans women \u201caren\u2019t ... offenders\u201d.\n\nAnother reason why Neeves deemed the tweet transphobic was because he had\nreceived \u201ca ton of hate\u201d, most of it presumably online, which is \u201cexactly what\nshe [Rowling] wanted to happen\u201d. But Neeves can\u2019t possibly know that. We often\ncause effects we don\u2019t want or intend. Indeed, it\u2019s a practical certainty that\nNeeves himself has said things that have (perhaps unintentionally) excited\ntrans trolls to abuse Rowling. Besides, adults should know better than to take\nonline nastiness seriously. If you really don\u2019t want to wallow in it, you can\nblock it. Or leave Twitter altogether.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, it is crystal clear what Rowling\u2019s main intention was. She was\nthrowing down the gauntlet to Scotland\u2019s new Hate Crime Act, whereby\n\u201clawmakers seem to have placed higher value on the feelings of men ... than on\nthe rights and freedoms of actual women and girls\u201d. As Rowling sees it, \u201cthe\nnew legislation is wide open to abuse by activists who wish to silence those\nof us speaking out about the dangers of eliminating women\u2019s and girl\u2019s single-\nsex spaces ... and the reality and immutability of biological sex ... Freedom\nof speech and belief are at an end in Scotland if the accurate description of\nbiological sex is deemed criminal\u201d.\n\nNeeves\u2019 third reason for thinking Rowling guilty of a \u201chate crime\u201d was that\nshe was being gratuitously nasty to trans folk who are just \u201cordinary people\nwho want to be happy\u201d. \u201cSince I\u2019ve been living my truth,\u201d he declared, \u201cI\ncouldn\u2019t be happier\u201d. But that\u2019s disingenuous. The issue is not whether\nbiological males should be left undisturbed by the law or social norms to play\nsocially constructed female gender roles. Rather, it\u2019s whether the rest of\nsociety should be compelled to play along. No one is denying the truth that\nNeeves feels deeply that he is a woman. But many refuse to endorse the truth\nof what Neeves feels. What\u2019s at issue is whether those who express such\ndissent \u2014 say, by refusing to use a trans person\u2019s preferred pronouns \u2014 should\nbe made criminals.\n\nBy playing a victimhood card he had no good reason to play, Neeves\ndeliberately obscured the point. He pretended that Rowling was just spewing\nout hatred, whereas in fact she was merely disagreeing, asserting a reasonable\nbelief, and making a bold protest in the cause of free speech.\n\n> Dissent and criticism need not be hateful, even when they threaten a deeply\n> treasured identity\n\nWe need to learn again to distinguish what was being willfully confused here\nand what is widely confused elsewhere \u2014 a confusion that Neeves\u2019 BBC\ninterviewer, Johnny Diamond, signally failed to call out. Dissent and\ncriticism need not be hateful, even when they threaten a deeply treasured\nidentity. For sure, if they\u2019re delivered in a contemptuous, insulting, or\nwantonly provocative fashion, they might become vehicles of hatred. But that\u2019s\nnot necessary. Content and manner are not the same thing, and common sense is\nusually perfectly capable of telling them apart.\n\nYes, there are cases where the refusal to confirm a deeply felt identity or\nactive criticism of it, even when communicated with due respect and\nsensitivity, so shakes a person\u2019s sense of themselves as to cause profound\ndistress. That identity could be transgender, but it could equally be\nreligious. Without doubt, there are tragic times when an atheist\u2019s criticism\nso shakes a religious believer\u2019s faith, and the identity and life built on it,\nas to drive him to despair, even suicide. Yet no one rises to accuse such\natheists of \u201chate crime\u201d. And no one\u2014any longer\u2014proposes that disturbing\nexpressions of atheistic belief be outlawed.\n\nSo, let\u2019s get this clear again: dissent is one thing; hatred, another. To be\ngender-critical is not to be \u201ctransphobic\u201d.\n\nShare\n\n## Enjoying The Critic online?
