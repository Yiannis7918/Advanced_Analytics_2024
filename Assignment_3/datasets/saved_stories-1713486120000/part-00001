Its meanings\nrun the gamut from the negative to the positive, from the overpowering to the\nmysterious, from anarchy to sublimity. The negative seems to lie at the root:\netymologists trace the word to \u201cnuisance\u201d and \u201cnausea.\u201d Noise is what drives\nus mad; it sends the Grinch over the edge at Christmastime. (\u201cOh, the Noise!\nNoise! Noise! Noise!\u201d) Noise is the sound of madness itself, the din within\nour minds. The demented narrator of Poe\u2019s \u201cThe Tell-Tale Heart\u201d jabbers about\nnoise while he hallucinates his victim\u2019s heartbeat: \u201cI found that the noise\nwas not within my ears. . . . The noise steadily increased. . . . The noise\nsteadily increased.\u201d\n\nYet noise can be righteous and majestic. The Psalms are full of joyful noise,\nnoise unto the Lord. In the Book of Ezekiel, the voice of God is said to be\n\u201clike a noise of many waters.\u201d In \u201cParadise Lost,\u201d Heaven makes \u201cinfernal\nnoise\u201d as it beats back the armies of Hell. Public Enemy\u2019s \u201cBring the Noise\u201d\nmarshals forces for a different kind of battle. At the same time, the word can\nsummon all manner of gentler murmurs: \u201cThe isle is full of noises, / Sounds\nand sweet airs.\u201d Tennyson speaks of a \u201cnoise of hymns,\u201d Coleridge of a \u201cnoise\nlike of a hidden brook.\u201d In Elizabethan England, a \u201cnoyse\u201d could be a musical\nensemble, such as the one that supplied a \u201cheavenly melodie\u201d for Queen\nElizabeth I\u2019s coronation pageant. Any hope of limiting the scope of the term\nevaporated when information theorists detached it from acoustics altogether\nand applied it to any ambient activity that hinders a signal. Noise has come\nto mean an engulfing barrage of data\u2014less an event than a condition.\n\nOther languages handle noise a bit less vaguely. In French, the most common\nterm is bruit, which comes from the Latin for \u201croar.\u201d That\u2019s a straightforward\ndescription of what a noise sounds like, as opposed to a subjective assessment\nof how it might upset us. In German, L\u00e4rm tends to indicate louder noises,\nGer\u00e4usch softer, more natural ones. Russians have a range of words, including\nshum, which, according to Vladimir Nabokov, suggests \u201cmore of a swoosh than a\nracket.\u201d When Osip Mandelstam wrote of shum vremeni\u2014\u201cthe noise of time\u201d\u2014he\ncaptured an essential texture of modern life.\n\nNoise is capacious enough to have inspired a small and ever-growing library.\nAlongside various cultural histories\u2014Bart Kosko\u2019s \u201cNoise,\u201d David Hendy\u2019s\n\u201cNoise,\u201d Mike Goldsmith\u2019s \u201cDiscord: The Story of Noise,\u201d Hillel Schwartz\u2019s\nnine-hundred-page \u201cMaking Noise\u201d\u2014you can read accounts of noise-music scenes\n(\u201cJapanoise,\u201d \u201cNew York Noise\u201d), noise-based literary criticism\n(\u201cShakespeare\u2019s Noise,\u201d \u201cKafka and Noise\u201d), and philosophies of noise (\u201cAn\nEpistemology of Noise,\u201d \u201cNoise Matters: Toward an Ontology of Noise\u201d), not to\nmention practical-minded guides to reducing noise from your hvac unit or\nreducing the noise in your head. How noise relates to music is a much bruited\ntopic in itself. Samuel Johnson offers an elegant resolution: \u201cOf all noises,\nI think music the least disagreeable.\u201d Music is our name for the noise that we\nlike.\n\nWith a universal definition hovering out of reach, the discourse concerning\nnoise often starts with the personal. My history with the thing is fraught: I\nhate it and I love it. As a child, I was extraordinarily sensitive to loud\nsounds. Family expeditions to Fourth of July fireworks displays or steam-\nrailway museums routinely ended with me running in tears to the safety of the\ncar. When, in early adulthood, I moved into the noise cauldron of New York\nCity, I was tormented by neighbors\u2019 stereos and by the rumble of the street. I\nstuffed windows with pillows and insulation; I invested in industrial-strength\nearplugs; I positioned an oversized window fan next to my bed. This neurosis\nhas subsided, but I remain that maddening hotel guest who switches rooms until\nhe finds one that overlooks an airshaft or an empty lot.\n\nAll the while, I was drawn to music that others would pay money to avoid.\nHaving grown up with classical music, I found my way to the refined bedlam of\nthe twentieth-century avant-garde: Edgard Var\u00e8se, John Cage, Karlheinz\nStockhausen, Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti. In college, I hosted a widely unheard radio show\non which I broadcast things like Ligeti\u2019s \u201cPo\u00e8me Symphonique\u201d\u2014a piece for a\nhundred metronomes. When someone called in to report that the station\u2019s signal\nhad gone down, I protested that we were, in fact, listening to music. Similar\nmisunderstandings arose when I aired Cage\u2019s \u201cImaginary Landscape No. 4,\u201d for\ntwelve radios. When I moved on to so-called popular music, I had ears only for\nthe churning dissonances of Cecil Taylor, AMM, and Sonic Youth. I became the\nkeyboardist in a noise band, which made one proudly chaotic public appearance,\nin 1991. At one point, my bandmates and I improvised over a tape loop of the\nminatory opening chords of Richard Strauss\u2019s \u201cDie Frau Ohne Schatten.\u201d\n\nObviously, my issues with noise pivot on the question of control. When the\nnoise occurs on my own terms, I enjoy it; when it\u2019s imposed on me, I recoil.\nThis bifurcation is typical, even if I represent an extreme case. Garret\nKeizer, in his incisive 2010 book, \u201cThe Unwanted Sound of Everything We Want:\nA Book About Noise,\u201d observes that the noise/music distinction is ultimately\nan ethical one. If you elect to hear something, it is not noise, even if most\npeople might deem it unspeakably horrible. If you are forced to hear\nsomething, it is noise, even if most people might deem it ineffably gorgeous.\nThus, Keizer writes, \u201cLou Reed\u2019s \u2018Metal Machine Music\u2019 performed at the\nGramercy is not noise; Gregorian Chant piercing my bathroom wall is.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnwanted sound\u201d is the basic definition. An act of aggression is implied:\nsomeone is exercising power by projecting sound into your space. Sometimes the\nact is unconscious: people don\u2019t realize how loud their speakers are, or they\nassume that everyone loves their music as much as they do. Sometimes, though,\nit is a gesture of undisguised brutality. Late one night in 2002, I asked some\nfrat-boyish neighbors to turn down their thumping techno. They responded by\nturning it up. When I complained again, one of them began shouting \u201cFucking\nfaggot!\u201d and hurling his body against my door. I lacked the presence of mind\nto remark upon the irony of homophobes blasting techno\u2014in Chelsea, of all\nplaces.\n\nWe seldom reject the sounds of people we like. Disputes over noise expose\nsocial fissures. The classic cinematic study of music, noise, and violence is\nSpike Lee\u2019s \u201cDo the Right Thing,\u201d in which Radio Raheem brings his boom box\ninside Sal\u2019s pizzeria, blaring Public Enemy\u2019s \u201cFight the Power.\u201d Sal says,\n\u201cWhat did I tell you about that noise?\u201d Radio Raheem protests, \u201cThis is music.\nMy music.\u201d Minutes later, he is dead, the victim of a police killing.\n\n\u201cI bring you I.P.\u201d\n\nCartoon by Jason Adam Katzenstein and Eliza Hittman\n\nLink copied\n\nThe perception of hip-hop as \u201cBlack Noise\u201d\u2014the title of a 1994 book by the\npop-culture scholar Tricia Rose\u2014is part of a long history of sonic\ndehumanization directed at minority groups. The word \u201cbarbarian\u201d originates\nfrom a disparaging Greek term, b\u00e1rbaros, which appears to evoke the alleged\ngibberish of foreign peoples (\u201cbar bar bar\u201d). The musicologist Ruth HaCohen\nhas tracked long-standing European perceptions of Jews as a peculiarly noisy\npeople. \u201cL\u00e4rm wie in einer Judenschule,\u201d or \u201cnoise as in a synagogue,\u201d\nremained a popular German expression into the Nazi period. (Mandelstam inverts\nthose perceptions in \u201cThe Noise of Time,\u201d relishing the intricacy of \u201cJewish\nchaos.\u201d) Colonizers who disdained the weird sounds of native peoples\noverlooked the fact that they themselves were causing unprecedented levels of\ncommotion\u2014bells, trumpets, guns, cannons, machines. Noise enables power. As\nKeizer writes, it is a way of saying, \u201cThe world is mine.\u201d\n\nAmid the hubbub of urban life, silence is a luxury of the rich. They can\nafford the full-floor penthouse apartment, the house that sits on a quiet\nacre. They can install triple-paned windows and pump insulation into the\nwalls. They can, if they choose, become Proust in his cork-lined room. For the\nrest of society, noise is an index of struggle. Hendy\u2019s \u201cNoise,\u201d which is\nbased on a 2013 BBC Radio series, documents the ruckus of tenement living in\neighteenth-century Edinburgh and the altogether hellish clamor inflicted on\nironworkers in nineteenth-century Glasgow. A doctor wrote of a group of\nGlasgow boilermakers, \u201cThe iron on which they stand is vibrating intensely\nunder the blows of perhaps twenty hammers wielded by twenty powerful men.\nConfined by the walls of the boiler, the waves of sound are vastly\nintensified, and strike the tympanum with appalling force.\u201d\n\nThe colossal cacophony of the Industrial Revolution prompted some of the first\nserious efforts at noise control. Often, these amounted to crabby \u00e9litism.\nCharles Babbage lamented the \u201corgan-grinders and other similar nuisances\u201d who\nwere degrading the productivity of \u201cintellectual workers.\u201d Charles Dickens\nsigned a letter claiming that writers and artists had become \u201cespecial objects\nof persecution by brazen performers on brazen instruments.\u201d But the New York\nanti-noise activist Julia Barnett Rice, who founded the Society for the\nSuppression of Unnecessary Noise in 1906, transcended upper-crust narcissism\nby arguing that people of all backgrounds were suffering from excessive noise\nin schools and hospitals. She intuited what scientific studies later\nconfirmed\u2014that noise can inhibit learning and complicate health issues. It can\nalso, of course, cause auditory damage, in the form of tinnitus, and hearing\nloss.\n\nAttempts to mitigate and legislate noise levels run up against the challenge\nof adjudicating which sounds are excessive and unpleasant. Measuring loudness\nis itself a tricky business. The decibel scale, like the Richter scale, is\nlogarithmic, and it accounts for quirky neural responses to changing stimuli.\nA twenty-decibel sound is generally perceived as being twice as loud as a ten-\ndecibel one, yet the actual intensity is ten times greater. Furthermore, the\ndecibel scale is customarily weighted to factor in additional peculiarities.\nWe are more sensitive to upper frequencies (a soprano is more conspicuous than\na bass), to indoor sounds, to nighttime sounds. With all these complexities,\nnoise codes, where they exist, are difficult to enforce. In 2022, New York\nCity\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection received nearly fifty thousand\ncomplaints but imposed monetary penalties in only a hundred and twenty-three\ninstances.\n\nEmergency warnings\u2014foghorns, locomotive whistles, ambulance and fire-truck\nsirens, air-raid sirens\u2014fall into a special category of necessary, life-saving\nnoise. Car horns are a borderline case: sometimes they stave off disaster, but\nmore often they foster road rage. Matthew F. Jordan\u2019s \u201cDanger Sound Klaxon!:\nThe Horn That Changed History\u201d studies one of the most purposefully obnoxious\nnoises of modern times\u2014the \u201caa-ooo-gah!\u201d honk that became ubiquitous on\nAmerican roads in the early twentieth century. In a free-for-all traffic\nenvironment, drivers alerted pedestrians and other vehicle operators by using\nthe horn incessantly. Ads for the Klaxon\u2014invented by the electrical engineer\nMiller Reese Hutchison, and introduced in 1907\u2014boasted of its ability to \u201ccut\nthrough and kill musical sounds.\u201d Raw panic was the aim. During the First\nWorld War, the Klaxon was used to warn of gas attacks; it then declined in\npopularity, partly because traumatized veterans reacted poorly to its squawk.\n\nWe humans have a high tolerance for noise, despite our ambivalence. In some\nway, we seem to require it. Other species feel differently about the never-\nending sonic havoc of the Anthropocene. Caspar Henderson, in \u201cA Book of\nNoises: Notes on the Auraculous,\u201d points out that when our species stayed\nmostly indoors during the early months of the covid pandemic the animal world\nreacted with apparent relief: \u201cBirdsongs regained qualities that had last been\nrecorded decades before, when cities were quieter. The white-crowned sparrows,\nfor instance, extended their sounds back down into lower frequencies . . . and\ntheir songs became richer, fuller and more complex.\u201d Birds also sang more\nsoftly: they \u201chad been \u2018shouting,\u2019 just as people raise their voices on a\nconstruction site or at a noisy party.\u201d Their stress levels likely declined.\nNoise is another dimension of humanity\u2019s ruination of the natural world.\n\nThe inexorable advance of technological noise in the twentieth century\u2014cars,\nairplanes, helicopters, pile drivers, lawnmowers, leaf blowers, home stereos,\nstadium sound systems\u2014left the impression that the world was getting louder\nyear by year. This may well have been so, but in recent decades there has\nactually been a levelling off, or even a decline, in certain types of noise.\nJet engines are less thunderous than they were in the seventies. The\nincreasing popularity of electric vehicles has brought about a situation in\nwhich cars can be dangerously inaudible to pedestrians. (Artificial engine\nnoise has become a feature of electric models.) People now routinely listen to\nmusic on laptops and headphones, reducing incursions of bass.\n\nThese modest gains are offset by the rise of informational noise, which\nfurther blurs the meaning of the already confused parent word. Chen-Pang\nYeang\u2019s \u201cTransforming Noise: A History of Its Science and Technology from\nDisturbing Sounds to Informational Errors, 1900-1955\u201d is thick with\nmathematical equations, yet it still tells an interesting story even for those\nof us who will skip the more technical pages. Beneath the vehicular roar in\nthe years around 1900 was a simmering new electronic sound, native to the\ntelephone, the phonograph, the radio, and other forms of transmission and\nreproduction. Yeang describes this noise as \u201cdisturbances and fluctuations of\nelectrical current due to the movements of microscopic charge carriers in\nelectronic tubes and other circuit components.\u201d Such sounds weren\u2019t\naggressively unpleasant, yet they hampered the communication of messages,\nverbal or musical. Scientists and engineers set about studying this electronic\nsizzle and figuring out how to reduce it.\n\nThe investigation soon intersected with ongoing inquiries into the movement of\ngas and liquid particles. Einstein\u2019s papers on Brownian motion, between 1905\nand 1908, not only established the existence of atoms; they also helped to\nsystematize the discipline of statistical mechanics, which describes patterns\nof random fluctuations over time, also known as stochastic processes. Defense\nwork during the Second World War adapted those insights to military ends:\ndevising uncrackable cryptography, resisting signal jamming, reducing\ninterference in anti-aircraft radar systems. Claude Shannon, the founder of\ninformation theory, took an even more significant step by demonstrating how a\nsignal can cope with a \u201cnoisy\u201d channel\u2014literally or figuratively\u2014if it behaves\nin a noisy, stochastic way: by spreading itself across a broad spectrum, it\ntransmits more effectively. That insight underpins modern cellular and\nwireless communications. It was a curious extension of the logic of the\nKlaxon: in a world full of noise, you punch through by making noise at a\nsuperior level.\n\nSoon enough, the concept of stochastic noise, often simplified to the point of\nvanishing, achieved currency in a dizzying array of fields. Noise studies of\nrecent decades examine perturbations in the stock market (the economist\nFischer Black\u2019s paper \u201cNoise\u201d), unreliable patterns in decision-making (Daniel\nKahneman, Olivier Sibony, and Cass Sunstein\u2019s \u201cNoise: A Flaw in Human\nJudgment\u201d), and irregularities in political polling (Nate Silver\u2019s \u201cThe Signal\nand the Noise\u201d). The proposed corrective for such errancy is, very often, the\ndreaded algorithm. Kahneman and company argued that algorithms, being \u201cnoise-\nfree,\u201d can \u201coutperform human judgment.\u201d Machine-learning protocols in\nartificial intelligence, meanwhile, rely heavily on stochastic processes. The\nultimate import of much of this work is that humans are themselves randomly\nfluctuating particles whose behavior, in aggregate, can be forecast by\nprobabilistic methods.\n\nYeang helps out the mathematically illiterate by offering a literary frame for\nnoise\u2019s semantic shift. In his introduction, he juxtaposes a nineteenth-\ncentury account of invasive sound\u2014Nathaniel Hawthorne\u2019s dismayed reaction to a\ntrain whistle\u2014with the Reagan-era data-scape of Don DeLillo\u2019s \u201cWhite Noise,\u201d\nwith its swarm of \u201cwords, pictures, numbers, facts, graphics, statistics,\nspecks, waves, particles, motes.\u201d White noise is a sound field in which all\nfrequencies are equally intense. When the married couple at the novel\u2019s\ncenter, Babette and Jack, have a conversation about death, the crack of doom\nbecomes a wash of static:\n\n> \u201cWhat if death is nothing but sound?\u201d\n>\n> \u201cElectrical noise.\u201d\n>\n> \u201cYou hear it forever. Sound all around. How awful.\u201d\n>\n> \u201cUniform, white.\u201d\n\nWhite noise is the master noise in which all other noises drown. The perpetual\nswirl of cultural particles mutes the resonance of any individual voice. The\nirony is that the atomized buzz common to so much late-twentieth-century\ntechnology\u2014fax machines, dial-up modems, the hiss between stations on a radio\ndial, the \u201cPoltergeist\u201d snow of a TV left on overnight\u2014has largely faded. Such\nnoise now resides in our minds, as we fend off notifications, updates, \u201cJust\nfor You\u201d suggestions, consumer-feedback requests, obscene spam, clickbait\nheadlines, A.I.-generated news stories, A.I.-generated news stories about\nA.I., and the whole silently screaming rest of it.\n\nFrom time to time, nature unleashes a noise so immense that it restores the\nBiblical grandeur of the word. Many books on noise mention the Indonesian\nvolcano Krakatoa, which, in August, 1883, disgorged what is commonly called\nthe loudest sound in modern history. The eruption was audible from as far as\nthree thousand miles away. The captain of a British ship that was forty miles\ndistant wrote, \u201cSo violent are the explosions that the eardrums of over half\nmy crew have been shattered. My last thoughts are with my dear wife. I am\nconvinced that the Day of Judgment has come.\u201d\n\nIn October, I went to the Brooklyn experimental-music venue ISSUE Project Room\nto hear \u201cVirtuAural Electro-Mechanics,\u201d a fifty-minute-long audio collage by\nthe sound artist Francisco L\u00f3pez. The performance space\u2014a cavernous Beaux-Arts\ngallery that McKim, Mead & White had originally designed for the Elks\norganization\u2014was plunged into darkness. Attendees were given masks to cover\ntheir eyes. In a program note, L\u00f3pez writes, \u201cThis creation was developed from\na myriad of original sound recordings of mechanical machines, electro-\nmechanical systems and industrial environments gathered over the past 25 years\nall over the world; from food factories to \u2018white rooms,\u2019 from 18th-century\nautomata to computers, from wood and wires to magnetism, from the microscopic\nto the monumental.\u201d\n\nIf you demand that music provide an oasis of melodious sweetness, \u201cVirtuAural\nElectro-Mechanics\u201d would not be for you. It is an experience of overwhelming\ndensity. Loudness is not its chief characteristic\u2014any average rock show or\ndance club would outdo it in decibels\u2014but it covers such a vast range of\nfrequencies and timbres, from lung-shaking bass tones to a tintinnabulation in\nstratospheric registers, that the brain struggles to assimilate the entirety\nof it. I imagined phantom structures in the air: the sound was bleeding into\nmy other senses.\n\nIs \u201cVirtuAural Electro-Mechanics\u201d music? In the usual sense, no. The Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary associates music with \u201cbeauty of form, harmony, melody,\nrhythm, expressive content, etc.,\u201d implicitly excluding machines in food\nfactories. The great German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz, in his 1863 tome,\n\u201cOn the Sensations of Tone,\u201d frames music as the opposite of noise. A musical\ntone, Helmholtz writes, is a \u201cperfectly undisturbed, uniform sound.\u201d Noise is\na jumble of rapid, irregular signals. Certain combinations of tones are more\npleasing than others, on account of physiological principles that Helmholtz\ncharts in extraordinary detail. European composers have perfected the art of\nharmony\u2014creating, it would appear, a bulwark against noise.\n\nIn this same period, though, composers began to have different ideas. Like\nbirds, they were listening to the world around them and mimicking its\nincreasingly raucous character. In Wagner\u2019s \u201cDas Rheingold,\u201d the subterranean\nsmithy of the Nibelungs is evoked by a percussion section that includes,\naccording to the score, eighteen anvils. For a few bars, the orchestra stops\nplaying and the anvils hammer away on their own\u2014industry incarnate. Harmony,\nmeanwhile, was drifting from its tonal moorings: fearsome dissonances in the\nmusic of Mahler, Strauss, and Scriabin suggested both the outer density of\nmodern life and the inner turmoil of the individual. Mahler said, \u201cIf we want\nthousands to hear us in the huge auditoriums of our concert halls and opera\nhouses, we simply have to make a lot of noise [L\u00e4rm].\u201d\n\nMatters came to a head in 1913. The brutish chords that stomp through the\nsecond section of Stravinsky\u2019s \u201cRite of Spring\u201d pack seven of the twelve notes\nof the Western chromatic scale into a confined space: as a result, pitch\nbecomes a blur. T. S. Eliot later wrote that the \u201cRite\u201d seems to \u201ctransform\nthe rhythm of the steppes into the scream of the motor horn, the rattle of\nmachinery, the grind of wheels, the beating of iron and steel, the roar of the\nunderground railway . . . to transform these despairing noises into music.\u201d On\nMarch 31, 1913, two months before the premi\u00e8re of the \u201cRite,\u201d a concert in\nVienna featuring works by Arnold Schoenberg and his circle let loose an even\nmore disturbing sound. In Alban Berg\u2019s orchestral song \u201c\u00dcber die Grenzen des\nAll,\u201d or \u201cBeyond the Limits of the Universe,\u201d the winds and the brass intone a\nsoft, unearthly sonority in which all twelve pitches are heard. This is an\ninstrumental approximation of white noise, long before the term had been\ncoined. The concert promptly devolved into a riot, one that even the famous\nuproar around the \u201cRite\u201d could not equal. Fisticuffs broke out, the police\nwere called, and a lawsuit ensued.\n\nCartoon by Harry Bliss and Steve Martin\n\nLink copied\n\nIn that same year of discord and scandal, the Futurist painter Luigi Russolo\npublished a manifesto titled \u201cL\u2019Arte dei Rumori\u201d (\u201cThe Art of Noises\u201d), in\nwhich he wrote, \u201cFor years, Beethoven and Wagner have deliciously shaken our\nhearts. Now we are fed up with them. This is why we get infinitely more\npleasure imagining combinations of the sounds of trolleys, autos and other\nvehicles, and loud crowds.\u201d To that end, Russolo and his brother Antonio\ndevised a battery of homemade noise instruments. A recording from 1921\nsuggests a caf\u00e9 band tootling away in a room with bad plumbing. Other\ncomposers made more persuasive ventures: solo-percussion works by Amadeo\nRold\u00e1n and by Edgard Var\u00e8se, early electronic experiments by Paul Hindemith\nand by Oskar Sala, noise collages by the young John Cage. Var\u00e8se\u2019s mammoth\norchestral piece \u201cAm\u00e9riques,\u201d which descended on Carnegie Hall in 1926,\nconjures the full pandemonium of the metropolis, with a New York Fire\nDepartment siren filling out the orchestra. George Antheil, in his \u201cBallet\nM\u00e9canique,\u201d which arrived at Carnegie the following year, called for airplane\npropellers whirring onstage, though he had to settle for electric fans.\n\nAs Yeang notes in \u201cTransforming Noise,\u201d Antheil played a cameo role in the\nevolution of stochastic research. During the Second World War, he assisted the\nHollywood star Hedy Lamarr, an Austrian \u00e9migr\u00e9 with a mathematical gift, in\ndesigning a frequency-hopping technology that would have prevented the jamming\nof torpedo-guidance systems. Nothing immediately came of the Lamarr-Antheil\nscheme, though it forecast later breakthroughs. After the war, the engineer\nturned composer Iannis Xenakis transformed stochastic process into musical\nlanguage. The instrumental lines of his 1955-56 score \u201cPithoprakta\u201d are\nexplicitly modelled on Brownian motion. Ligeti\u2019s \u201cPo\u00e8me Symphonique,\u201d from\n1962, does something analogous. At first, the hundred metronomes generate a\nuniform cloud of indistinguishable ticktocks. Then, as one device after\nanother winds down, the remaining voices become audible. In performance, the\n\u201cPo\u00e8me\u201d begins as a comedy and ends as a tragedy\u2014an emblem of a dying\necosystem.\n\nNoise enriched popular music, too. Jazz musicians, extending the blues\ntradition, activated pitches outside the standard twelve-note gamut. The\nsirenlike sneer of the trombone glissando became a signature sound. Jazz not\nonly cut through the crackle of surface noise but also thrived on it. The\nemergence of a full-blown jazz avant-garde, after the Second World War,\nbrought musical modernism to an exuberant peak. Rock entered its noise-art\nphase in the seventies and eighties, with the industrial grind of such bands\nas Throbbing Gristle and Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten. Hip-hop manipulated noise\nfrom the outset. Hank Shocklee, Public Enemy\u2019s master producer, echoed the\nrhetoric of Var\u00e8se and Cage when he said, \u201cWe believed that music is nothing\nbut organized noise. You can take anything\u2014street sounds, us talking, whatever\nyou want\u2014and make it music by organizing it. . . . This thing you call music\nis a lot broader than you think it is.\u201d\n\nSupreme among noisemakers is Yoko Ono, who first made her name as a principled\nprovocateur in the downtown New York scene\u2014next to her, Cage looked timid\u2014and\nthen shot to global fame through her relationship with John Lennon. Her\nfuriously nuanced screaming of the word \u201cwhy\u201d at the beginning of \u201cYoko\nOno/Plastic Ono Band,\u201d from 1970, was a masterly act of one-upmanship in the\nface of the masculinist assault of mainstream rock and roll. Beatles fans,\nconfronted with noise of a higher order, were as aghast as the socialite\naristocrats who booed \u201cThe Rite of Spring.\u201d Noise is only one part of Ono\u2019s\nmercurial practice\u2014she is equally drawn to meditative gentleness\u2014but she\ndeserves a central place in histories of the genre. For the most part, she has\nbeen left out of them.\n\nImplicit in the art of noise is a promise of resistance. For millennia, music\nhas been a medium of control; noise, it follows, is a liberation. Schoenberg\nwent so far as to speak of the \u201cemancipation of the dissonance,\u201d making his\nharmonic innovations sound like a civil-rights matter. The social theorist\nJacques Attali, in his 1977 book, \u201cNoise: The Political Economy of Music,\u201d put\na sophisticated spin on that argument. The bruit nouveau that Attali hears\nemerging from free jazz and the European avant-garde has a revolutionary\nimport: it denies the marketplace, it refuses popular taste, it involves\n\u201cinventing new codes\u201d and \u201cplaying for one\u2019s own pleasure.\u201d Subsequent\ntreatises, such as Paul Hegarty\u2019s \u201cNoise/Music,\u201d have maintained Helmholtz\u2019s\nduality while reversing its biases, so that noise heroically destroys music\u2019s\nstifling banalities.\n\nThe question is: Resistance to what? Nothing about noisemaking guarantees\npersonal or political virtue. Russolo, like many other members of the Futurist\nmovement, found a way to reconcile his bourgeois-bashing ideas with Fascist\naesthetics. Var\u00e8se was tainted by racism and antisemitism. In more recent\ndecades, Nazi iconography and vocabulary have adorned noise records by\nWhitehouse and Boyd Rice. The magisterial Japanese noise artist Masami Akita,\nwho has released hundreds of implacably obliterative recordings under the name\nMerzbow, has shown self-awareness about this mentality of domination.\n\u201cSometimes I would like to kill the much too noisy Japanese by my own Noise,\u201d\nhe has said. \u201cThe effects of Japanese culture are too much noise everywhere. I\nwant to make silence by my Noise. Maybe that is a fascist way of using sound.\u201d\n\nStephen Graham, who teaches courses on underground music at Goldsmiths, in\nLondon, takes a different tack in \u201cBecoming Noise Music,\u201d a survey of the\nfield since the seventies. Aware of the murkiness surrounding the notion of\nresistance, Graham focusses instead on the genre\u2019s aesthetics. Furthermore,\nthe opposition of \u201cnoise\u201d and \u201cmusic\u201d dissatisfies him: the appeal of this\ngrittiest of genres lies precisely in the erasure of the boundary between the\ntwo. There is no way of talking about noise without taking pleasure into\naccount. The pleasure may be confined to a niche audience, and perhaps a\nsomewhat masochistic one, but it exists all the same. No one chooses to listen\nto a sound because of what it is not.\n\nHow do you articulate the aesthetics of a music that follows a logic of\ndumbfounding excess? Graham makes a good stab in some pages devoted to\nMerzbow\u2019s album \u201cNoisembryo,\u201d from 1994. He begins by observing, somewhat\ndryly, that the listener is \u201cconfronted with a kind of chaotic \u2018order\u2019 or\nmusicality flickering into and out of existence as, say, a steady pulse\npattern emerges, or an oscillating bass drone throbs into existence, or a\npanrhythm of clashing noise layers suddenly locks into polyrhythmic place.\u201d He\nthen switches to stream-of-consciousness italics to convey the rush of\nsurrender: \u201cI flow into the beating world, staying there as the music keeps\nchanging and pulsing; it\u2019s possible to transcend\u2014trance\u2014in this way with more\nconventional music, but the low rate of repetition and high rate of density\nand strangeness in noise means that such trancing can have a particularly rich\ntensile quality when it\u2019s achieved. . . . This music takes me out of (my) self\nand makes me cosmic.\u201d\n\nSuch effusions are a bit embarrassing to read\u2014but any critic who wishes to\ncapture pleasure must embarrass the reader sooner or later. I experience\nfeelings similar to Graham\u2019s when I lose myself in exemplary spells of musical\nnoise, whether it\u2019s Merzbow, Ono, the apocalyptic war scenes in Chaya\nCzernowin\u2019s opera \u201cInfinite Now,\u201d or the Krakatoan subwoofer frequencies of\nAsh Fure\u2019s installation \u201cHive Rise.\u201d The thrill I get from such sounds doesn\u2019t\ncontradict my abiding love for Bach, Schubert, and Brahms any more than the\nabstract frenzy of a Jackson Pollock contradicts the radiant calm of a Fra\nAngelico. What I love about noise is its insistence on otherness, on\ndifference. If music were ever to become a universal language, it would be\ndead.\n\nAs for L\u00f3pez\u2019s \u201cVirtuAural Electro-Mechanics,\u201d it left me in a state of happy\nvacancy, as if the digital detritus in my brain had been swept away. Yet I had\nbeen engaged in active, alert listening. I\u2019d been nodding and swaying in time,\neven when no beat was apparent. The colliding pulses seemed to coalesce into a\nfundamental ghost rhythm that was as insistent as any pounding bass. The mind\nis its own place, as Milton\u2019s Lucifer says. It can establish its own order,\nits own harmony. I walked out into the streets of Brooklyn feeling alive,\nserene, peculiarly free. When I entered the screech of the subway, though, I\nwinced and put on noise-cancelling headphones. \u2666\n\nPublished in the print edition of the April 22 & 29, 2024, issue.\n\n## New Yorker Favorites\n\n  * Why facts don\u2019t change our minds.\n\n  * The tricks rich people use to avoid taxes.\n\n  * The man who spent forty-two years at the Beverly Hills Hotel pool.\n\n  * How did polyamory get so popular?\n\n  * The ghostwriter who regrets working for Donald Trump.\n\n  * Snoozers are, in fact, losers.\n\n  * Fiction by Jamaica Kincaid: \u201cGirl\u201d\n\nSign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New\nYorker.\n\nAlex Ross has been the magazine\u2019s music critic since 1996.
