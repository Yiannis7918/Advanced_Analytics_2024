The controversial law allows for\nfar-reaching monitoring of foreign communications, but has also led to the\ncollection of US citizens\u2019 messages and phone calls.\n\nLawmakers voted 273\u2013147 to approve the law, which the Biden administration has\nfor years backed as an important counterterrorism tool. An amendment that\nwould have required authorities seek a warrant failed, in a tied 212-212 vote\nacross party lines.\n\nDonald Trump opposed the reauthorization of the bill, posting to his Truth\nSocial platform on Wednesday: \u201cKILL FISA, IT WAS ILLEGALLY USED AGAINST ME,\nAND MANY OTHERS. THEY SPIED ON MY CAMPAIGN!!!\u201d\n\nThe law, which gives the government expansive powers to view emails, calls and\ntexts, has long been divisive and resulted in allegations from civil liberties\ngroups that it violates privacy rights. House Republicans were split in the\nlead-up to vote over whether to reauthorize section 702, the most contentious\naspect of the bill, with Mike Johnson, the House speaker, struggling to unify\nthem around a revised version of the preexisting law.\n\nRepublicans shot down a procedural vote on Wednesday that would have allowed\nJohnson to put the bill to a floor vote, in a further blow to the speaker\u2019s\nability to find compromise within his party. Following the defeat, the bill\nwas changed from a five-year extension to a two-year extension of section 702\n\u2013 an effort to appease far-right Republicans who believe Trump will be\npresident by the time it expires.\n\nSection 702 allows for government agencies such as the National Security\nAdministration to collect data and monitor the communications of foreign\ncitizens outside of US soil without the need for a warrant, with authorities\ntouting it as a key tool in targeting cybercrime, international drug\ntrafficking and terrorist plots. Since the collection of foreign data can also\ningest communications between people abroad and those in the US, however, the\nresult of section 702 is that federal law enforcement can also monitor\nAmerican citizens\u2019 communications.\n\nSection 702 has faced opposition before, but it became especially fraught in\nthe past year after court documents revealed that the FBI had improperly used\nit almost 300,000 times \u2013 targeting racial justice protesters, January 6\nsuspects and others. That overreach emboldened resistance to the law,\nespecially among far-right Republicans who view intelligence services like the\nFBI as their opponent.\n\nTrump\u2019s all-caps post further weakened Johnson\u2019s position. Trump\u2019s online\nremarks appeared to refer to an FBI investigation into his former campaign\nadviser, which was unrelated to section 702. Other far-right Republicans such\nas Matt Gaetz similarly vowed to derail the legislation, putting its passage\nin peril.\n\nMeanwhile, Ohio congressman Mike Turner, Republican chair of the House\nIntelligence Committee, told lawmakers on Friday that failing to reauthorize\nthe bill would be a gift to China\u2019s government spying programs, as well as\nHamas and Hezbollah.\n\n\u201cWe will be blind as they try to recruit people for terrorist attacks in the\nUnited States,\u201d Turner said Friday on the House floor.\n\nCalifornia Democratic representative and former speaker Nancy Pelosi also gave\na statement in support of passing section 702 with its warrantless\nsurveillance abilities intact, urging lawmakers to vote against an amendment\nthat would weaken its reach.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have the time right now, but if members want to know I\u2019ll tell you\nhow we could have been saved from 9/11 if we didn\u2019t have to have the\nadditional warrants,\u201d Pelosi said.\n\nDebate over Section 702 pitted Republicans who alleged that the law was a tool\nfor spying on American citizens against others in the GOP who sided with\nintelligence officials and deemed it a necessary measure to stop foreign\nterrorist groups. One proposed amendment called for requiring authorities to\nsecure a warrant before using section 702 to view US citizens\u2019 communications,\nan idea that intelligence officials oppose as limiting their ability to act\nquickly. Another sticking point in the debate was whether law enforcement\nshould be prohibited from buying information on American citizens from data\nbroker firms, which amass and sell personal data on tens of millions of\npeople, including phone numbers and email addresses.\n\nSection 702 dates back to the George W Bush administration, which secretly ran\nwarrantless wiretapping and surveillance programs in the aftermath of the 9/11\nterror attacks. In 2008, Congress passed section 702 as part of the Fisa\nAmendments Act and put foreign surveillance under more formal government\noversight. Lawmakers have renewed the law twice since, including in 2018 when\nthey rejected an amendment that would have required authorities to get\nwarrants for US citizens\u2019 data.\n\nLast year Merrick Garland, the attorney general, and Avril Haines, director of\nnational intelligence, sent a letter to congressional leaders telling them to\nreauthorize section 702. They claimed that intelligence gained from it\nresulted in numerous plots against the US being foiled, and that it was partly\nresponsible for facilitating the drone strike that killed al-Qaida leader\nAyman Al-Zawahiri in 2022.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * US politics\n  * Surveillance\n  * US Congress\n  * House of Representatives\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
