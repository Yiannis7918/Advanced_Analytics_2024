It complements a similar post on the leading Blog\nThat Peter Wrote.\n\n[Add: this post is now supplemented by my more detailed post on the legal\nmythology of Julian Assange; also do see this excellent post by barrister Anya\nPalmer.]\n\nPlease note that particularly relevant in this case are the three English\ncourt rulings which are freely available on-line: Magistrates\u2019 Court, High\nCourt, and Supreme Court.\n\nSubscribe to the Saturday Read View all newsletters\n\nYour new guide to the best writing on ideas, politics, books and culture each\nweekend \u2013 from the New Statesman.\n\nTHANK YOU\n\n## One: \u201cThe allegation of rape would not be rape under English law\u201d\n\nThis is flatly untrue. The Assange legal team argued this twice before English\ncourts, and twice the English courts ruled clearly that the allegation would\nalso constitute rape under English law.\n\n(See my post at Jack of Kent for further detail on this.)\n\n## Two: \u201cAssange is more likely to be extradited to USA from Sweden than the\nUnited Kingdom\u201d\n\nThis is similarly untrue. Any extradition from Sweden to the United States\nwould actually be more difficult. This is because it would require the consent\nof both Sweden and the United Kingdom.\n\n(See Francis FitzGibbon QC\u2019s Nothing Like the Sun for further detail on this.)\n\nOne can add that there is no evidence whatsoever that the United Kingdom would\nnot swiftly comply with any extradition request from the United States; quite\nthe reverse. Ask Gary McKinnon, or Richard O\u2019Dwyer, or the NatWest Three.\n\nIn reality, the best opportunity for the United States for Assange to be\nextradited is whilst he is in the United Kingdom.\n\n## Three: \u201cSweden should guarantee that there be no extradition to USA\u201d\n\nIt would not be legally possible for Swedish government to give any guarantee\nabout a future extradition, and nor would it have any binding effect on the\nSwedish legal system in the event of a future extradition request.\n\nBy asking for this \u2018guarantee\u2019, Assange is asking the impossible, as he\nprobably knows. Under international law, all extradition requests have to be\ndealt with on their merits and in accordance with the applicable law; and any\nfinal word on an extradition would (quite properly) be with an independent\nSwedish court, and not the government giving the purported \u2018guarantee\u2019.\n\n(See extradition and criminal lawyer Niall McCluskey for further detail on\nthis.)\n\nAlso Sweden (like the United Kingdom) is bound by EU and ECHR law not to\nextradite in circumstances where there is any risk of the death penalty or\ntorture. There would be no extradition to the United States in such\ncircumstances.\n\n(See Mark Klamberg\u2019s blog for further information on this.)\n\n## Four: \u201cThe Swedes should interview Assange in London\u201d\n\nThis is currently the most popular contention of Assange\u2019s many vocal\nsupporters. But this too is based on a misunderstanding.\n\nAssange is not wanted merely for questioning.\n\nHe is wanted for arrest.\n\nThis arrest is for an alleged crime in Sweden as the procedural stage before\ncharging (or \u201cindictment\u201d). Indeed, to those who complain that Assange has not\nyet been charged, the answer is simple: he cannot actually be charged until he\nis arrested.\n\nIt is not for any person accused of rape and sexual assault to dictate the\nterms on which he is investigated, whether it be Assange or otherwise. The\nquestion is whether the Swedish investigators can now, at this stage of the\nprocess, arrest Assange.\n\nHere the best guide is the High Court judgment. In paragraph 140, the Court\nsets out the prosecutor\u2019s position, and this should be read in full be anyone\nfollowing this case:\n\n> 140\\. Mr Assange contended prior to the hearing before the Senior District\n> Judge that the warrant had been issued for the purpose of questioning Mr\n> Assange rather than prosecuting him and that he was not accused of an\n> offence. In response to that contention, shortly before that hearing, Mrs Ny\n> provided a signed statement dated 11 February 2011 on behalf of the\n> Prosecutor:\n>\n> \u201c6. A domestic warrant for [Julian Assange\u2019s] arrest was upheld [on] 24\n> November 2010 by the Court of Appeal, Sweden. An arrest warrant was issued\n> on the basis that Julian Assange is accused with probable cause of the\n> offences outlined on the EAW.\n>\n> \u201c7. According to Swedish law, a formal decision to indict may not be taken\n> at the stage that the criminal process is currently at. Julian Assange\u2019s\n> case is currently at the stage of \u201cpreliminary investigation\u201d. It will only\n> be concluded when Julian Assange is surrendered to Sweden and has been\n> interrogated.\n>\n> \u201c8. The purpose of a preliminary investigation is to investigate the crime,\n> provide underlying material on which to base a decision concerning\n> prosecution and prepare the case so that all evidence can be presented at\n> trial. Once a decision to indict has been made, an indictment is filed with\n> the court. In the case of a person in pre-trial detention, the trial must\n> commence within 2 weeks. Once started, the trial may not be adjourned. It\n> can, therefore be seen that the formal decision to indict is made at an\n> advanced stage of the criminal proceedings. There is no easy analogy to be\n> drawn with the English criminal procedure. I issued the EAW because I was\n> satisfied that there was substantial and probable cause to accuse Julian\n> Assange of the offences.\n>\n> \u201c9. It is submitted on Julian Assange\u2019s behalf that it would be possible for\n> me to interview him by way of Mutual Legal Assistance. This is not an\n> appropriate course in Assange\u2019s case. The preliminary investigation is at an\n> advanced stage and I consider that is necessary to interrogate Assange, in\n> person, regarding the evidence in respect of the serious allegations made\n> against him.\n>\n> \u201c10. Once the interrogation is complete it may be that further questions\n> need to be put to witnesses or the forensic scientists. Subject to any\n> matters said by him, which undermine my present view that he should be\n> indicted, an indictment will be lodged with the court thereafter. It can\n> therefore be seen that Assange is sought for the purpose of conducting\n> criminal proceedings and that he is not sought merely to assist with our\n> enquiries.\u201d\n\nAnd in paragraph 160 of the same judgment, the High Court explains why such a\nrequirement is not \u201cdisproportionate\u201d as submitted by Assange\u2019s lawyers:\n\n> 160\\. We would add that although some criticism was made of Ms Ny in this\n> case, it is difficult to say, irrespective of the decision of the Court of\n> Appeal of Svea, that her failure to take up the offer of a video link for\n> questioning was so unreasonable as to make it disproportionate to seek Mr\n> Assange\u2019s surrender, given all the other matters raised by Mr Assange in the\n> course of the proceedings before the Senior District Judge.\n>\n> The Prosecutor must be entitled to seek to apply the provisions of Swedish\n> law to the procedure once it has been determined that Mr Assange is an\n> accused and is required for the purposes of prosecution.\n>\n> Under the law of Sweden the final stage occurs shortly before trial. Those\n> procedural provisions must be respected by us given the mutual recognition\n> and confidence required by the Framework Decision; to do otherwise would be\n> to undermine the effectiveness of the principles on which the Framework\n> Decision is based. In any event, we were far from persuaded that other\n> procedures suggested on behalf of Mr Assange would have proved practicable\n> or would not have been the subject of lengthy dispute.\n\n## Five: \u201cBy giving Assange asylum, Ecuador is protecting freedom of the\npress\u201d\n\nThis is perhaps the strangest proposition.\n\nEcuador has a woeful record on freedom of the press. It is 104th in the index\nof world press freedom, and even the quickest glance at the examples of press\nabuse in Ecuador accumulated by Reporters Without Borders and Index on\nCensorship indicate a regime with a starkly dreadful and illiberal record on\nfreedom of expression.\n\nIt has even recently been reported that a blogger called Alexander Barankov is\nto be extradited by Ecuador to Belarus, of all places, where he may face the\ndeath penalty.\n\nWhatever the reason for Ecuador granting political asylum to Assange, there is\nno basis for seeing it as based on any sincere concern for media freedom\neither in Ecuador or elsewhere.\n\n## The way forward\n\nDue process is important. It is the formal means by which competing demands\nand seperate interests can be accommodated and reconciled in any overall\nlitigation process. This is why due process is an important liberal principle.\n\nAssange has challenged the arrest warrant in Sweden. It was upheld.\n\nHe then repeatedly challenged the European Arrest Warrant in the United\nKingdom. He lost at every stage, but each of his many legal arguments were\nheard and considered in extensive detail.\n\nAnd in doing this, Assange had the assistance of first rate legal advice and\nadvocacy from some of the UK\u2019s leading human rights lawyers, and he also had\nthe benefit of having been granted bail in England in the meantime. The\nextradition was fought by him all the way to the Supreme Court.\n\nAssange has been afforded more opportunities to challenge the warrant for his\narrest than almost any other defendant in English legal history. This is\nhardly \u201cpersecution\u201d or a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d.\n\nThe English side of the process is now almost over: there is a valid European\nArrest Warrant which has to be enforced as a matter of international law.\n\nIf Assange is extradited to Sweden, it may well be that the serious\nallegations of rape and sexual assault cannot be substantiated. But that is\nentirely a matter for the Swedish investigators and for any Swedish court. It\nis not an issue which can be dealt with by proxy in English litigation, and\nstill less by heated internet exchanges. In the event of an extradition\nrequest by the USA then Assange has the same rights under EU and ECHR law as\nhe has in the United Kingdom, together with an additional safeguard of consent\nbeing required from both UK and Sweden. It is difficult to see a sensible and\nwell-based reason why Assange should not now go to Sweden.\n\nEven taking the worries of Assange and his supporters at face value and at\ntheir highest, there is nothing which actually means the due process of a\ncurrent rape and sexual assault investigation should be delayed any further or\nabandoned.\n\nIt is important to remember that complainants of rape and sexual assault have\nrights too, even when the suspect is Julian Assange.\n\n[Postscript, 22 August: the \u201ctemporary surrender\u201d Zombie fact has now been\nexposed by legal blogger Greg Callus. This means all the supposed legal points\nargued by Assange supporters have been addressed by one UK legal blogger or\nother.]\n\nDavid Allen Green is legal correspondent of the New Statesman\n\nComments on this blog are now closed.\n\n###### Content from our partners\n\n###### Unlocking the potential of a national asset, St Pancras International\n\nRichard Thorp\n\n###### Time for Labour to turn the tide on children\u2019s health\n\nNikita Sinclair\n\n###### How can we deliver better rail journeys for customers?\n\nSamir Jeraj\n\nRelated\n\nBook of the Day\n\n##### Delusions of immortality\n\nBusiness\n\n##### The wisest investment in your child is not giving them a smartphone\n\nScience & Tech\n\n##### The scientific reason why January lasts forever\n\n### David Allen Green\n\nDavid Allen Green is a lawyer and writer.
