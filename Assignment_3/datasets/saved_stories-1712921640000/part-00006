(Official WeChat account of\nQingpu District, Shanghai Municipality)\n\nCHENG TING-FANG, Nikkei Asia chief tech correspondentApril 11, 2024 11:58 JST | China\n\nCopyCopied\n\nTAIPEI -- Huawei Technologies is building a massive semiconductor equipment\nresearch and development center in Shanghai as the Chinese tech titan\ncontinues to beef up its chip supply chain to counter a U.S. crackdown.\n\nThe center's mission includes building lithography machines, vital equipment\nfor producing cutting-edge chips. Washington's export controls have sharply\nreduced Huawei's access to this equipment, whose production is dominated by\njust three companies: ASML of the Netherlands and Japan's Nikon and Canon.\n\nTo staff the new center, Huawei is offering salary packages worth up to twice\nas much as local chipmakers, industry executives and sources briefed on the\nmatter told Nikkei Asia. The company has already hired numerous engineers who\nhave worked with top global chip tool builders like Applied Materials, Lam\nResearch, KLA and ASML, they said, adding that chip industry veterans with\nmore than 15 years of experience at leading chipmakers like TSMC, Intel and\nMicron are also among recent and potential hires.\n\nWashington's tighter export controls over the past few years have also\nimpacted the job market in China, including by making it more difficult for\nChinese citizens to work for foreign chip companies in the country. This has\nleft more top chip talent available for Huawei and other local companies to\nchoose from.\n\nBut while Huawei's compensation package is generous, its working culture can\nbe challenging, according to chip industry managers.\n\n\"Working with them is brutal. It's not 996 -- meaning working from 9 a.m. to 9\np.m., six days a week. ... It will literally be 007 -- from midnight to\nmidnight, seven days a week. No days off at all,\" one Chinese chip engineer\ntold Nikkei Asia. \"The contract will be for three years, [but] the majority of\npeople can't survive till renewal.\"\n\nSemiconductor equipment, like chips themselves, have been caught in the\ncrosshairs of U.S. export controls. Washington has lobbied allies Japan and\nthe Netherlands to implement similar restrictions on the export of advanced\nchip tools to limit China's access to them.\n\nThese restrictions have spurred many Chinese chipmakers to seek domestic\nalternatives wherever possible. Naura, China's leading supplier of\nsemiconductor equipment, has seen its revenue more than quadruple since 2018\nand is expected to report another record year in 2023.\n\nHuawei, too, has responded to the U.S. crackdown by aggressively beefing up\nits domestic capabilities.\n\nIts new R&D center is located in the Qingpu district of west Shanghai, sources\nbriefed on the matter said, on a spacious campus that also houses a major chip\ndevelopment center and the new headquarters of HiSilicon Technologies,\nHuawei's chip design unit. There are also research centers for wireless\ntechnologies and smartphones on the premises.\n\nTotal investment for the the entire R&D base will come to about 12 billion\nyuan ($1.66 billion), according to the Shanghai government, which listed it as\none of the city's top projects for 2024.\n\nThe campus covers about 224 football fields in area and is almost twice as big\nas the company's renowned Ox Horn Campus, a European village-style site in the\nChinese city of Dongguan. Like Ox Horn, the Shanghai campus will include\ntrains for commuting between buildings in the campus. When completed, it will\nbe able to accommodate more than 35,000 high-tech workers, according to the\nPeople's Government of Qingpu District of Shanghai Municipality.\n\nHuawei said it had no comments in response to Nikkei Asia's request for\ncomment on its chip equipment efforts and referred question about its R&D\ncampus to the Shanghai government.\n\nThe look of Huawei's Ox Horn Campus in the Chinese city of Dongguan is modeled\nafter a European village. (Photo by Cheng Ting-Fang)\n\nHuawei's R&D spending in 2023 reached a record high of 164.7 billion yuan,\nrepresenting 23.4% of its total revenue.\n\nBefore the U.S. added Huawei to its trade blacklist, the company focused\nmainly on chip design and partnered with global production partners like TSMC\nand Globalfoundries for manufacturing. After its access to American\ntechnologies was curbed, Huawei turned to Chinese chipmaker SMIC and local\nchip developers. It is now venturing into chip production itself with partners\nbacked by local governments in multiple Chinese cities, such as Shenzhen,\nQingdao and Quanzhou, Nikkei first reported. It has also invested in many\nlocal providers of chip materials.\n\nHuawei has been one of the most aggressive Chinese companies in terms of using\nlocal suppliers and investing in domestic alternatives, analysts say.\n\nBrady Wang, a semiconductor analyst with Counterpoint, said Huawei has worked\nhard to localize its chip-related sources and switch to local components from\nsuppliers such as BOE Technology and Omnivision. \"They've invested more in\nHiSilicon and introduced chips for phones and servers,\" Wang said. \"They will\nstrive to localize a greater portion of their semiconductor supply chain.\nHowever, realizing these efforts, particularly those related to chip\nmanufacturing and equipment, will be a time-intensive undertaking.\"\n\n## Read Next\n\n  * International relations\n\n#### Canada spies found China interfered in last two elections, probe hears\n\n  * Caixin\n\n#### Huawei's HarmonyOS Next is set to rival iOS and Android in China\n\n  * US-China tensions\n\n#### Yellen calls on China to offer level playing field for U.S. companies\n\n  * US-China tensions\n\n#### U.S. criminal case against China's Huawei heads toward 2026 trial\n\n  * Technology\n\n#### Huawei says 2023 net profit doubled despite U.S. crackdown\n\n## Latest On Semiconductors\n\n  * Semiconductors\n\n#### Renesas restarts shuttered plant to meet power chip demand\n\n  * Semiconductors\n\n#### TSMC's Q1 revenue rise beats market expectations on AI boom\n\n  * Semiconductors\n\n#### Taiwan chip design support majors triple sales in four years\n\n## Sponsored Content\n\n### About Sponsored Content This content was commissioned by Nikkei's Global\nBusiness Bureau.\n\nDiscover the all new Nikkei Asia app\n\n#### Get Insights on Asia in your inbox\n\nRegister for our newsletters\n\n#### Connect With Us\n\nNikkei Inc.
