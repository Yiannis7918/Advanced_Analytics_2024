Your profile can be used (also later) to present\nadvertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by\nthis and other entities.\n\nIf you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this\ninformation could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike\naccessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a\ndifferent website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike\naccessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury\ncar manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your\ninterest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are\ninterested in luxury cycling gear.\n\nAn apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It\ngets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income\ncustomers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create\nprofiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to\nhave a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising\nwithin partner apps based on those profiles.\n\nVendors129 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * A.Mob\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdElement Media Solutions\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * AdSpirit AdServer\n  * AdTheorent\n  * AdTiming\n\n1-10 / 129\n\nUse profiles to select personalised advertising\n\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising\nprofiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or\napps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and\npersonal aspects.\n\nAn online retailer wants to advertise a limited sale on running shoes.

Data\nrelating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics\nis then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.\n\nAn advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with\nits adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics\nof users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of\nsimilar platforms, across different devices.

All the latest news for any part of\nthe world you select.\n\nArthur Mensch, tall and lean with a flop of unkempt hair, arrived for a speech\nlast month at a sprawling tech hub in Paris wearing jeans and carrying a\nbicycle helmet. He had an unassuming look for a person European officials are\ncounting on to help propel the region into a high-stakes match with the United\nStates and China over artificial intelligence.\n\nMr. Mensch, 31, is the chief executive and a founder of Mistral, considered by\nmany to be one of the most promising challengers to OpenAI and Google. \u201cYou\nhave become the poster child for A.I. in France,\u201d Matt Clifford, a British\ninvestor, told him onstage.\n\nA lot is riding on Mr. Mensch, whose company has shot into the spotlight just\na year after he founded it in Paris with two college friends. As Europe\nscrambles to get a foothold in the A.I. revolution, the French government has\nsingled out Mistral as its best hope to create a standard-bearer, and has\nlobbied European Union policymakers to help ensure the firm\u2019s success.\n\nArtificial intelligence will be built rapidly into the global economy in the\ncoming decade, and policymakers and business leaders in Europe fear that\ngrowth and competitiveness will suffer if the region does not keep up. Behind\ntheir worries is a conviction that A.I. should not be dominated by tech\ngiants, like Microsoft and Google, that might forge global standards at odds\nwith the culture and politics of other countries. At stake is the bigger\nquestion of which artificial intelligence models will wind up influencing the\nworld, and how they should be regulated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe issue with not having a European champion is that the road map gets set\nby the United States,\u201d said Mr. Mensch, who just 18 months ago was working as\nan engineer at Google\u2019s DeepMind lab in Paris, building A.I. models.

As the United States turned out Google, Meta and Amazon, and China\nproduced Alibaba, Huawei and ByteDance, which owns TikTok, Europe\u2019s digital\neconomy failed to deliver, according to a report by France\u2019s Artificial\nIntelligence Commission. The 15-member committee \u2014 which includes Mr. Mensch \u2014\nwarned that Europe was lagging on A.I., but said it had the potential to take\na lead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nMistral\u2019s generative A.I. technology allows businesses to launch chatbots,\nsearch functions and other A.I.-driven products. It has surprised many by\nbuilding a model that rivals the technology developed at OpenAI, the U.S.\nstart-up that ignited the A.I. boom in 2022 with the ChatGPT chatbot. Named\nafter a powerful wind in France, Mistral has rapidly gained ground by\ndeveloping a more flexible and cost-efficient machine-learning tool. Some big\nEuropean firms are beginning to use its technology, including Renault, the\nFrench auto giant, and BNP Paribas, the financial services company.\n\nImage\n\nEurope\u2019s leaders at the U.K. Artificial Intelligence Safety Summit last year.\nArtificial intelligence will be built rapidly into the global economy in the\ncoming decade.Credit...Pool photo by Toby Melville\n\nThe French government is giving Mistral its full-throated support. President\nEmmanuel Macron has called the company an example of \u201cFrench genius\u201d and had\nMr. Mensch for dinner at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e presidential palace. Bruno Le Maire, the\ncountry\u2019s finance minister, frequently praises the company, while C\u00e9dric O,\nthe former France digital minister, is an adviser to Mistral and owns shares\nin the start-up.\n\nThe French government\u2019s backing is a sign of A.I.\u2019s growing importance. The\nUnited States, France, Britain, China, Saudi Arabia and many other countries\nare trying to strengthen their domestic capabilities, setting off a\ntechnological arms race that is influencing trade and foreign policy, as well\nas global supply chains.\n\nMistral has emerged as the strongest European contender in the global battle.\nYet many question whether the company can keep up with large American and\nChinese competitors and develop a sustainable business model. In addition to\nthe considerable technological challenges of building a successful A.I.\ncompany, the computing power needed is staggeringly expensive. (France says\nits cheap nuclear power can meet the energy demand.)\n\nOpenAI has raised $13 billion, and Anthropic, another San Francisco firm, has\nraised more than $7.3 billion. Mistral has so far raised roughly 500 million\neuros, or $540 million, and earns \u201cseveral million\u201d in recurring revenue, Mr.\nMensch said. But in a sign of Mistral\u2019s promise, Microsoft took a small stake\nin February, and Salesforce and the chipmaker Nvidia have backed the start-up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThis could be one of the best shots that we have in Europe,\u201d said Jeannette\nzu F\u00fcrstenberg, the managing director of General Catalyst and a founding\npartner of La Famiglia, two venture capital firms that invested in Mistral.\n\u201cYou basically have a very potent technology that will unlock value.\u201d\n\nMistral subscribes to the view that A.I. software should be open source,\nmeaning that the programming codes should be available for anyone to copy,\ntweak or repurpose. Supporters say allowing other researchers to see the code\nwill make systems safer and fuel economic growth by speeding its use among\nbusinesses and governments for applications like accounting, customer service\nand database searches. This week, Mistral released the latest version of its\nmodel online for anyone to download.\n\nOpenAI and Anthropic, by contrast, are keeping their platforms closed. Open\nsource is dangerous, they argue, because it has the potential to be co-opted\nby for bad purposes, like spreading disinformation \u2014 or even creating\ndestructive A.I.-powered weapons.\n\nMr. Mensch dismissed such concerns as the narrative of \u201ca fear-mongering\nlobby\u201d that includes Google, Microsoft and Amazon, which he said were seeking\nto cement their dominance by persuading policymakers to enact rules that would\nsquash rivals.\n\nImage\n\n\u201cThe issue with not having a European champion is that the road map gets set\nby the United States,\u201d Mr. Mensch said.Credit...Dmitry Kostyukov for The New\nYork Times\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nA.I.\u2019s biggest risk, Mr. Mensch added, is that it will spur a workplace\nrevolution, eliminating some jobs while creating new ones that will require\nretraining. \u201cIt\u2019s coming faster than in the previous revolutions,\u201d he said,\n\u201cnot in 10 years but more like in two.\u201d\n\nMr. Mensch, who grew up in a family of scientists, said he was fascinated by\ncomputers from a young age, learning to program when he was 11. He played\nvideo games avidly until age 15, when he decided he could \u201cdo better things\nwith my time.\u201d After graduating from two elite French universities, \u00c9cole\nPolytechnique and \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, he became an academic researcher\nin 2020 at France\u2019s prestigious National Center for Scientific Research. But\nhe soon pivoted to DeepMind, an A.I. lab acquired by Google, to learn about\nthe industry and become an entrepreneur.\n\nWhen ChatGPT burst onto the scene in 2022, Mr. Mensch teamed up with his\nuniversity friends, who decided that they could do the same or better in\nFrance. At the company\u2019s airy work space, a corps of sneaker-wearing\nscientists and programmers now tap busily at keyboards, coding and feeding\ndigital text culled from the internet \u2014 as well as reams of 19th-century\nFrench literature, which is no longer subject to copyright law \u2014 into the\ncompany\u2019s large language model.\n\nImage\n\nA member of the audience coding while Mr. Mensch spoke at Station F in Paris\nlast month.Credit...Dmitry Kostyukov for The New York Times\n\nMr. Mensch said he felt uncomfortable with Silicon Valley\u2019s \u201cvery religious\u201d\nfascination with the concept of artificial general intelligence, the point\nwhen, tech leaders like Elon Musk and Sam Altman believe, computers will\novertake the cognitive ability of humans, with potentially dire consequences.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe whole A.G.I. rhetoric is about creating God,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe\nin God.

So I don\u2019t believe in A.G.I.\u201d\n\nA more imminent threat, he said, is the one posed by American A.I. giants to\ncultures around the globe.\n\n\u201cThese models are producing content and shaping our cultural understanding of\nthe world,\u201d Mr. Mensch said. \u201cAnd as it turns out, the values of France and\nthe values of the United States differ in subtle but important ways.\u201d\n\nWith his growing clout, Mr. Mensch has stepped up his calls for lighter\nregulation, warning that restrictions will damage innovation. Last fall,\nFrance successfully lobbied in Brussels to limit regulation of open-source\nA.I. systems in the European Union\u2019s new Artificial Intelligence Act, a\nvictory that helps Mistral maintain a rapid development pace.\n\n\u201cIf Mistral becomes a big technical power,\u201d said Mr. O, the former digital\nminister who led the lobbying effort, \u201cit\u2019s going to be beneficial for all of\nEurope.\u201d\n\nLiz Alderman is the chief European business correspondent, writing about\neconomic, social and policy developments around Europe.
