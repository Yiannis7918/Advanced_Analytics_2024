These \u201cAI bets\u201d are\nalso a warning for the future. Don\u2019t trust the billionaire class.\n\nMake no mistake, Tesla\u2019s FSD story was a marketing ploy and likely one of the\nbiggest frauds of our generation in high-tech consumer products. AVs or cars\nwith autonomous vehicle driving capabilities was an \u201cAI\u201d dream much more\ndifficult in reality to implement. I think the last 15 years of failed\npromises can attest to that.\n\nSome AI stories take on a magnitude of their own over time. Tesla\u2019s promises\naround full-self driving or FSD, is such a story. While full-autonomy would be\nlevel 5 ordinarily, Tesla\u2019s \u201cFSD\u201d naming is controversial, because vehicles\noperating under FSD remain at Level 2 automation (with some features of Level\n3) and are therefore not \"fully self-driving\" and require active driver\nsupervision.\n\n###\n\nWant to Chat about this?\n\nBrowse the Chat\n\nFrom Michael Spencer\u2019s subscriber chat\n\nMichael Spencer Hey Everyone, Welcome to AI Chat What does everyone think\nabout Elon Musk's 'Robotaxi' reveal in August for Tesla's FSD. Is level 5\nautonomy finally coming to Tesla vehicles? To what extent, in what\ncircumstances? Will Tesla's FSD ever come to fruition as promised? Is Elon\nMusk a champion of deceptive marketing or is FSD only adding to his legend? In\ndigging into this I was pretty surprised how fraudulent many of his claims\nwere about Tesla's AI and tech components.\n\n25 replies...\n\nCovering emerging tech across multiple publications, including in\nsemiconductors, quantum computing and AI startups, has taught me a lot.\n\nIn case you are new to all of this and how the internet is full of\nmisinformation in the news these days, a lot of hype is not factual. If\ntechnology news is mostly public relations (\u201cPR\u201d), as an industry its\nreadership is in a stark decline because it\u2019s not reporting in good faith.\nElon Musk tries to criticize the mainstream media, but Tesla\u2019s marketing\naround AI is probably the biggest fraud of the industry.\n\n> ### Elon Musk tries to criticize the mainstream media, but Tesla\u2019s marketing\n> around AI is probably the biggest fraud of the industry. It\u2019s blatant false\n> advertising.\n\nShare this post if you tend to agree:\n\nShare\n\nTesla's FSD costs have tripled since 2019, costing more than $15,000 in the\nUnited States. This pumped up, fraudulently, Tesla\u2019s margins on selling\nvehicles, however Elon Musk\u2019s promises did not come to fruition after many\ndeadlines have passed.\n\nIn a recent April 5th Tweet on X, Elon Musk says full level 5 FSD is coming in\nAugust, 2024. Tesla\u2019s stock so far in 2024 is down 33%. Now the \u201cRobotaxi\u201d\npromise is trending on X, and a lot of people don\u2019t have good things to say\nabout this.\n\nElon Musk has 180 million followers on X, but the narrative seems to be\npolluting the brand.\n\n  * Elon Musk\u2019s promises since 2016 haven\u2019t come to fruition. Read it for yourself: Master Plan, Part Deux.\n\n  * In 2024, we have to admit Baidu, Waymo and even others are well ahead of Tesla in autonomous driving and AV innovation.\n\n  * Tesla keeps making unrealistic promises to its consumers and B2C base.\n\n  * The graph below would indicate good things are coming?

China is producing EVs at a price to quality\npoint that Western brands can no longer compete with in 2024. Lei claimed the\nstandard version of the SU7 beat the Model 3 on more than 90% of its\nspecifications.\n\nXiaomi is an innovative company, it\u2019s not even a native EV player. It claims\nits SU7 would be the best sedan \u201cunder 500,000 yuan\u201d ($69,328).\n\n###\n\nThe Danger of Making \u201cAI Promises\u201d to Consumers\n\n  * Tesla\u2019s \u201cFall to Earth\u201d is now a major tech (WSJ)story in 2024.\n\n  * It highlights the dangers of making \u201cAI promises\u201d that you cannot keep.\n\n  * It also demonstrates that Western \u201cfirst-movers\u201d don\u2019t have a competitive moat against China for the most part in anything related to the \u201cAI industry\u201d.\n\nSo why do brands make \u201cAI\u201d promises at the scale of Tesla and its FSD failure?\nBecomes it\u2019s so profitable to mislead consumers and shareholders. Elon Musk\nisn\u2019t known for his integrity and ethics in business development. He might be\namong the most skilled scam artists of tech history. Elon Musk has gone from\ninspirational figure to con artist in a decade.\n\nNow even VW is pulling out of China. Western brands are noticing they can\u2019t\n\u201ckeep up\u201d in China\u2019s super-competitive EV market. That Chinese maker market is\ncoming now to Europe, South America and SE Asia. Tariffs alone prevent them\nfrom dominating the American car market. The Americans lost the EV battle and\nTesla\u2019s decline might prove it.\n\n###\n\nTesla\u2019s Declining Share of the Global EV Market\n\nCurrently, (as of March, 2024), Tesla holds a 19.9% share of the market,\nclosely followed by BYD with 17.1%.\n\nSource: Visual Capital.\n\nDo you notice anything unusual about this list? There is only one American\nbrand and four Chinese brands in the top ten in EV sales globally. Three\nGerman brands, but they are also on the decline. There are more Chinese brands\non the fringes of the top 10 that could move up.\n\n###\n\nTesla is not an AI Company.\n\nThe myth that Tesla is a technology or AI company has been very crucial in the\nfalse promise marketing around the brand. Elon Musk\u2019s weird response to this\nfailure in 2024 is to poach AI talent from his Tesla to his own x.AI company.\n\nThis is because x.AI plans to do a huge $3 Billion funding round that would\nvalue the AI startup at $18 Billion. This is all more or less breaking news.\n\nThe problem is AI frauds have a habit of big declines. Elon Musk may have to\nmake his SpaceX company, valued at around $180 billion as of early 2024, go\npublic with an IPO to raise the funds needed to support his X Corp empire.\n\n###\n\nFSD was Too Good to be True\n\nNo conversation about self-driving can ignore Tesla. AVs were an AI promise\nthat was too good to be true. It\u2019s led to a lot of carnage in Silicon Valley.\nApple has let go 600+ jobs related to its failed Project Titan, that wasted\nten years in development. Google\u2019s Waymo cut more than 100 jobs a little over\none year ago.\n\nTesla\u2019s FSD was the entire narrative of how Tesla was more than a car company.\nAt one point Tesla seemed years ahead of the competition, but that gap has\nnarrowed quickly in recent years and shows no signs of remaining significant.\n\n###\n\nElon Musk\u2019s False Claims\n\nMusk has spoken about the robotaxi project for years, and that it could\nrepresent a major new business for the carmaker as investors grow wary of the\ncompany during a period of slowing growth.\n\n  * In 2015, Elon Musk told shareholders that Tesla\u2019s cars would achieve \u201cfull autonomy\u201d within three years.\n\n  * In 2016, he said Tesla would able to send one of its cars on a cross-country drive without requiring any human intervention by the end of the following year.\n\n  * Tesla still has yet to deliver a robotaxi, autonomous vehicle or technology that can turn its cars into \u201clevel 3\u201d automated vehicles.\n\n  * In a push for end-of-quarter sales, Musk recently mandated that all sales and service staff install and demo FSD for customers before handing over the keys.\n\nThe desperation at Tesla is very noticeable in 2024. But has its time run out?\n\n##\n\nHow do Tech Frauds Usually Turn out?\n\nFor Tesla that repeatedly and often claimed to be an AI company, things don\u2019t\nlook so good recently.\n\nSales are dropping. It's cutting prices, and FSD has not panned out. It\u2019s not\njust late, it may never arrive.\n\nThe AI hype around FSD and the reality have bifurcated and it\u2019s hard seeing\nhow the stock can get new legs after all the promises have run out.\n\nIn investor speak, it\u2019s a brutal reality:\n\nThe number of cars Tesla sold in the first quarter missed Wall Street\u2019s\nexpectations by such a wide margin that it\u2019s worth wondering how much of the\nelectric vehicle giant\u2019s demand problem is baked into the lofty expectations\nfor its revenue and earnings growth over the next few years.\n\nEveryone who (once) wanted a Tesla, likely already has one. Cheaper vehicles\nfrom China are coming. It\u2019s literally for Musk, the worst case scenario for\nthe future of Tesla. One that I like many others had predicted.\n\n###\n\nTesla is losing the AI Talent War\n\nTesla is also no longer the cool kid around in the AI talent war.\n\nOpenAI have also poached a lot of their talent.\n\n###\n\nTesla Cannot Compete Against Low Cost EV VEhicles made in China\n\nTesla knows it cannot compete in low-cost vehicles. According to Reuters,\n(also breaking news), Tesla has canceled the long-promised inexpensive car\nthat investors have been counting on to drive its growth into a mass-market\nautomaker, according to three sources familiar with the matter and company\nmessages seen by Reuters.\n\nThis is a major blow to shareholders and Tesla fans. If you cannot beat them,\ndon\u2019t even try. Elon Musk has since disputed the Reuters story entirely on his\nX platform.\n\n###\n\nTesla\u2019s FSD Isn\u2019t Safe\n\nSafety remains the paramount metric for autonomous vehicle deployment, yet\nthere has to be industry consensus on how to adequately measure a robotic or\nhuman driver\u2019s safety.\n\nTesla\u2019s FSD safety record isn\u2019t good. The AI fraud on consumers put passengers\nin serious danger, according to multiple reports.\n\nIn retrospect and I don\u2019t put this lightly, Elon Musk\u2019s automatic driving\ntechnology seems to be roughly an order of magnitude more deadly than human\ndrivers.\n\nBuying a Tesla it turns out is a major health and safety risk. If you thought\nLevel 3 was Level 5, think again!\n\nTesla has had a rough start to 2024 amid sluggish demand, but I think the AI\nfraud component of FSD is a major theme as well that\u2019s leading to less EV\ndemand in the United States. Lack of charging stations, lack of good faith in\nadvertising.\n\n###\n\nWhat do the Levels Mean?\n\n##### Level 1 (Driver Assistance)\n\nThis is the lowest level of automation. The vehicle features a single\nautomated system for driver assistance, such as steering or accelerating\n(cruise control). Adaptive cruise control, where the vehicle can be kept at a\nsafe distance behind the next car, qualifies as Level 1 because the human\ndriver monitors the other aspects of driving such as steering and braking.\n\n##### Level 2 (Partial Driving Automation)\n\nThis means advanced driver assistance systems or ADAS. The vehicle can control\nboth steering and accelerating/decelerating. Here the automation falls short\nof self-driving because a human sits in the driver\u2019s seat and can take control\nof the car at any time. Tesla Autopilot and Cadillac (General Motors) Super\nCruise systems both qualify as Level 2.\n\n##### Level 3 (Conditional Driving Automation)\n\nThe jump from Level 2 to Level 3 is substantial from a technological\nperspective, but subtle if not negligible from a human perspective.\n\nLevel 3 vehicles have \u201cenvironmental detection\u201d capabilities and can make\ninformed decisions for themselves, such as accelerating past a slow-moving\nvehicle. But\u2015they still require human override. The driver must remain alert\nand ready to take control if the system is unable to execute the task.\n\nFor all intents and purposes between 2016 and 2023, Tesla\u2019s FSD never really\ngot beyond Level 3 in any meaningful and consistent or safe way.\n\n###\n\nTesla\u2019s Historical AI Fraud in a Nutshell\n\nMusk\u2019s repeated claims that autonomous vehicles were just \u201ca year\u201d or so away,\nare now part of Tesla lore. Tesla\u2019s narrative was not based on actual facts.\n\nI am not clear how Elon Musk\u2019s conduct on this doesn\u2019t have career ending\nlawsuits, probes and costly regulation. Perhaps because the U.S. were so inept\nat developing EV technology, Tesla was seen as their best bet. Apparently rule\nof law doesn\u2019t apply in all circumstances.\n\nThat\u2019s not a picture of Silicon Valley and BigAuto that\u2019s very reassuring. If\nthe US can\u2019t build stuff in AI, maybe that\u2019s a problem?\n\nThere have been hundreds of crashes involving Tesla vehicles using FSD and\nAutopilot and dozens of deaths. Major recalls, Government investigations, but\nTesla\u2019s stock somehow remained a symbol of American greed in the early 2020s.\nThe cult of Tesla has almost been a cult of personality story for the inflated\nstock.\n\nTo recap, 2024 is the year of the robot, the birth of Agentic AI, more\npowerful SLMs and an incredible open-source LLM ecosystem, but Tesla didn\u2019t\neven get most important AI goal right after nearly a decade of work.\n\nTesla vehicles are not self-driving. Even other car manufactures have caught\nup to Tesla\u2019s so-called AI technology in autonomy. Tesla doesn't use Lidar\nbecause it's too expensive and bulky for consumer cars. This itself was once\nvery controversial. But given multi-year FSD\u2019s failure, Tesla is a brand in\nstark decline.\n\nIt\u2019s time to throw Elon Musk in the \u201cAI dumpster bin\u201d of Tech Billionaire bros\nwho have committed gigantic fraud. This is like committing future sin on\nfuture descendants. I would be (more) upset if this had not been entirely\npredictable.\n\nShare\n\nTesla is a doomed brand and Elon Musk\u2019s credibility has waned significantly in\nthe Generative AI era.\n\nIf your basic tech doesn\u2019t work, you should probably not a be a $500 bn.\ncompany.\n\n> \"Our dedicated robo taxi products will have quasi-infinite demand. The way\n> we are gonna manufacture the robo taxi is itself revolutionary. It will be\n> by far the highest units per hour of any vehicle production ever.\" - Elon\n> Musk.\n\nI\u2019m very excited to witness the downfall of Elon Musk, because like Sam Altman\nof OpenAI, he\u2019s been a pawn of the Billionaire class. Tesla\u2019s story is a\nwarning of the decline of America in technology. It\u2019s actually a prelude to\nAmerica\u2019s lost manufacturing and inability to execute in AI.\n\nTesla pretending it was an AI or technology company was never going to last.\n\nLeave a comment\n\nThe future of the robotaxi is very much in doubt.\n\nTesla delivered 386,810 vehicles worldwide in the first quarter, down 8.5%\nfrom the same period a year earlier. A lot lower than expectations:\n\n  * Is this a sign of things to come for Tesla\u2019s decline? It was the company's lowest quarterly sales since the third period of 2022.\n\n  * I\u2019d be happy to ride in a Waymo or Apollo Go vehicle, but as a passenger I\u2019d be reluctant to even enter a Tesla vehicle with what we know today.\n\nCar rental company Hertz got it right in early 2024, dumping Teslas which were\na nightmare for their company. High repair costs, poor resale value and a\nshockingly high accident rate, became a major problem to the bottom line.\n\nWhat is the bottom line for FSD of Tesla? It was a grand deception. Should\nTesla\u2019s robotaxi be banned? Delivery tallies are a rough proxy for sales and\nit feels like Tesla is a loser in 2024. Consider this a warning if you own the\nstock $TSLA.\n\nElon Musk\u2019s conduct recently resembles that of an AI prophet whose cult has\nbeen found out to be fraudulent. Tough times.\n\nRobotaxis are coming, Waymo and Baidu\u2019s Apollo are entering and arriving at\nmore cities. For all the Teslas already sold, we have to be realistic with how\nlong it will take and how safe and trustworthy Robotaxis need to be for even\nlimited real-world operation and pilots to move forwards. By the time Tesla\u2019s\nRobotaxi dream arrives, if it ever does, Tesla as a company will likely be\nirrelevant. Do your due diligence on AI promises and claims that AI will\nchange everything.\n\n###\n\nThe Robotaxi Arrival Date Dilemma\n\nThe term \u201cartificial intelligence\u201dwas coined in 1955, we have decades more to\ngo until we can be proud of this technology. GM has invested about $8 billion\nin Cruise since 2016. Countless Billions have been lost on this R&D and \u201cAI\nDream\u201d. Let\u2019s not hype or rush the future, the idea of owning a car that would\nwork for you as a robotaxi part-time was one of the craziest ideas ever\nmarketed to consumers.\n\n### Subscribe to AI Supremacy\n\nBy Michael Spencer \u00b7 Hundreds of paid subscribers\n\nNews at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, technology and business\nincluding Op-Eds, research summaries, guest contributions and valuable info\nabout A.I. startups.\n\n31 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n8 Restacks\n\n31\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Biggest AI Hype Fraud of All Time\n\naisupremacy.substack.com\n\n13\n\nShare\n\n13 Comments\n\nMichael WoudenbergPolymathic Being3 hrs agoHonestly, Elon is likely to pull it\noff.
