They told us it was effective. They told us everyone\nwas doing it. They told us not getting it was selfish. They told us it was the\nonly way we could study, work, shop, live.\n\nWe listened to them. Why would they lie to us? We trusted them. Why would they\nhurt us?\n\nSo we got it.\n\nAnd every day since that irrevocable, life-shattering decision has been\nunrelenting agony and exhaustion, apprehension and regret, uncertainty and\ndread.\n\nOur lives are now a continuum of questioning, of searching, of testing, of\nfretting.\n\nThey tell us we\u2019re faking it. They tell us we\u2019re lying. They tell us we\u2019re\nimagining it. They tell us we\u2019re anxious. They tell us we\u2019re exaggerating.\nThey tell us we\u2019re grifting.\n\nAnd once it\u2019s undeniable\u2014 when the diagnostics show heart damage, blood clots,\nmyocarditis, pericarditis, cardiac arrest, hematologic abnormalities, impaired\nimmune functionality, shingles, Bell\u2019s palsy, Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome,\nautoimmune disease, multiple sclerosis, transverse myelitis, neuropathy,\nparalysis, multi-organ inflammation, leprosy, strokes, dementia, prion\ndisease, cerebrovascular disease, brain damage, tinnitus, turbo cancer, DNA\nintegration, deep vein thrombosis, post-vaccination syndrome, multisystem\nfailure\u2014 then they tell us they\u2019re baffled. Then they tell us they don\u2019t know\nhow to fix it.\n\nEvery day, we research as if it our lives depend on it, because they do.\nBecause only we and our loved ones care enough to save us.\n\nFor some, we\u2019re a statistic, a number on a spreadsheet.\n\nFor others, we don\u2019t exist. They don\u2019t want us to exist.\n\nThey refuse to see us, They refuse to hear us, They refuse to feel us, They\nrefuse to help us.\n\nEvery minute, we scrape together the strength to endure the anguish, to resist\nthe gaslighting, to seek out supplements, procedures, practices\u2014 anything that\nwill offer relief, anything that will soften the suffering, anything that will\ndelay our terminal diagnosis.\n\nThey tell us to shut up. They tell us not to scare others. They tell us it is\nrare. They tell us it was worth it.\n\nAnd no one takes responsibility\u2014 not the NGOs that hocus-pocused us, not the\ncorporations that poisoned us, not the governments that coerced us, not the\nagencies that betrayed us, not the institutions that mandated us, not the\nphilanthropaths who targeted us, not the ideologues who ridiculed us, not the\ntyrants who scapegoated us, not the politicians who maneuvered us, not the\nenforcers who penned us, not the psychologists who manipulated us, not the\npropagandists who petrified us, not the experts who hoodwinked us, not the\nscientists who head-faked us, not the censors who erased us, not the doctors\nwho pushed us, not the nurses who needled us, not the pharmacists who stabbed\nus.\n\nThey call us anti-vaxxers. But we got jabbed? They call us conspiracy\ntheorists. But we believed them? They call us science-deniers. But we trusted\nit?\n\nAnd now we\u2019re on our own\u2014 without support, without compensation, without legal\nrecourse.\n\nSome of us have lost our jobs, our insurance, our babies, our lives.\n\nThey don\u2019t need us anymore. They don\u2019t want us anymore.\n\nThey got what they ordered ... and moved on.\n\nEach twinge of pain is silver in their pockets. Each desperate scream is Musak\nin their waiting room. Each vaxxicide is another piece of evidence buried.\n\nSo that\u2019s why we have to live. That\u2019s why we have to survive. That\u2019s why we\nhave to fight. That\u2019s why we have to wage justice.\n\nWe are living proof of their fraud, of their cruelty, of their tyranny.\n\nChisel our truth into your hearts. Tattoo our stories onto your arms.\nPhotograph our faces with your minds.\n\nTestify to our torment. Testify to their lies. Testify to their crimes.\n\nSee us. Hear us. Feel us. Help us.\n\nNote: This poem focuses on people living with injuries; murder victims will be\nhonored in a separate piece.

I know\nthere\u2019s an ocean of mis/dis/mal/information out there to navigate, so I\u2019ve\ncompiled this handy list of reasons you\u2019ll want to rush your child to the\nnearest injection site stat.\n\nRead full story\n\n#\n\nA Personal Note\n\nI recently suffered what I thought was the worst pain of my life after\ninjuring my back. Nearly every movement felt like digging around the exposed\nnerves with a sickle probe. I was finally starting to feel normal again when I\nre-injured it, and that was the worst pain of my life\u2014to the point that I\npassed out twice.\n\nI am sharing this not to elicit pity (I\u2019m on the mend and functional again, so\nplease don\u2019t worry) but because it was understanding what the vaxx-injured\nendure without respite that helped me get through this experience. I\nspecifically thought of Cody while I was crying, moaning, and screaming out\nthe pain. Perhaps you, too, can draw strength from their example in times of\ncrisis, misery, and desperation.\n\nWhat I am going through is merely temporary. I cannot fathom the fortitude,\ncourage, and resilience it requires to persist despite being bombarded with\nrelentless suffering from multiple illnesses and injuries, with each one\ntriggering a cascade of others.\n\nAnd yet they use their voices to try to help others heal and avoid the same\nliving torment\u2014even as they are stigmatized, silenced, and gaslit. Nothing\ncompares to the level of self-sacrifice they have embodied since their lives\nwere forever altered.\n\n####\n\nThe vaxx-injured are the heroes of our time. Please make others see, hear,\nfeel, and help them by sharing this poem and supporting Cody, React19, Real\nNot Rare, and the vaxx-injured individuals in your life.\n\nShare\n\nSupport Cody\n\nSupport React19\n\nSupport Real Not Rare Victims\n\n####\n\nCody\u2019s family, for example, is facing potential homelessness because the\nmedical bills have taken nearly everything from them.\n\nMargaret Anna AliceMar 31\n\nI have had the privilege of corresponding with Heather (\n\n@A mother's anthem\n\n) and Cody (\n\n@Modern Age Critical Reader\n\n), and they are two of the bravest, kindest, most resilient individuals I\nknow. They are also fellow bibliophiles and cat-lovers.\n\nThis post is long, but I urge you to read it in full. For all they have\nsuffered, the least we can do ...\n\n\u201cour dear friends who lost their son sixteen days after his COVID shot showed\nus a city you had never been to. They always tell me, \u2018You have your son. It\nmay be hard, and it isn\u2019t how it should be, but you have your son; he is still\nalive; our son is gone.\u2019 Knowing how precious each day is for us to have you\nhere, they wanted us to make memories and give you hope, no matter how sick\nyou are. So, they took you to a beautiful Japanese garden that their son, who\npassed away, used to love to go to with them. You walked slowly and with your\ncane, holding onto each of us as needed. We took our time and were in the\nshade. We saw giant Koi, wild iguanas, and Japanese Zen gardens. It was\nperfect. It was just what you needed. You were shown love and kindness. It\ntook a lot out of you, but we all were there to support you. You desperately\nneeded this kindness. They are a blessing and it is a miracle that they can\nshow kindness even though they suffered such loss.\u201d\n\nA mother's anthem\n\nCongress, the CDC, the FDA, and the HHS have left the vaccine injured in\nsimilar legal circumstances to Guantanamo detainees, dehumanized, no rights,\nno redress, and more.
