To make sure your TV isn\u2019t one\nof the unlucky few that gets unscrupulously commandeered by a dark web cretin,\nmake sure to update your device right now.\n\nIs Bitcoin too speculative?\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nview video\n\nIs Bitcoin too speculative?\n\nOn Tuesday, security firm Bitdefender published security research revealing\nfour different software bugs impacting LG\u2019s WebOS TV operating system. The\nbugs, which affect about 91,000 devices worldwide, could allow a bad actor to\ngain a number of invasive privileges, including the ability to get root access\nto an impacted device. Researchers write that the bugs \u2014 which impact WebOS\nversions 4 through 7 \u2014 could hypothetically allow a hacker to add a new user\nto the device, inject their own code into it, and thus \u201cfully take over\u201d the\nTV. Bitdefender originally alerted LG to these issues in November. Gizmodo\nreached out to LG for comment and will update this story if it responds.\n\nArs Technica helpfully notes that, in cases like this, it\u2019s not just a matter\nof your TV potentially getting hijacked. If a bad actor gets into the accounts\nlinked to your device, they may have access to a wealth of other personal\ndata, including email account access and financial information. You could also\nwind up getting your device tied into a crypto-mining scheme or a botnet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the map of the bugs provided by Bitdefender, it looks like around 7,000\ndevices in the United States are vulnerable. A majority of the impacted\ndevices are located in South Korea and Hong Kong, as well as in Sweden.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo make absolutely sure that your device is safe, you should ensure that\nyou\u2019ve updated your TV to its latest software version. LG released a patch for\nthe security issues as part of its latest update on March 22. Most LG devices\nshould have downloaded this update automatically. That said, if you want to\nmake absolutely sure you\u2019ve got the latest version of WebOS TV, follow LG\u2019s\ninstructions and head to Settings > Support > Software Update, and click\n\u201cCheck for Updates.\u201d If there is one, hit \u201cDownload and Install.\u201d That\u2019s it \u2014\nthat\u2019s all you have to do.
