We share tactics,\ntrends and valuable resources we've observed in the world of community\nbuilding.\n\n#### \ud83d\udcab Subscribe to The Observatory\n\nToday, we\u2019re excited to announce that two spacefaring companies are combining\ntheir powers. In other words, Orbit is joining Postman, the leading API\nplatform, where our scope and ambitions will broaden but our mission will\nremain the same: to help companies build awesome developer communities. As\npart of the Postman API Network, Orbit will apply our technology and expertise\nto help API builders discover, grow, and serve their communities right on\nPostman.\n\n### Why Postman?\n\nBecause the communities are already there. More than 30 million developers and\n500,000 organizations use Postman to discover and develop against tens of\nthousands of APIs\u2014and they\u2019ve made the Postman API Network the largest API hub\nin the world.\n\nAnd these developers are not passive\u2014they are actively calling APIs and\nbuilding real products on top of them. This creates a huge opportunity for API\nbuilders to engage directly with some of their most important developers,\ntheir inner circle as we'd refer to it in the Orbit Model. These developers\nhave mountains of feedback, suggestions, roadmap ideas, and real-world\nexperience just waiting to be shared. Many of them are on Postman every day,\nsome for hours at a time.\n\nThe community is there and waiting to be catalyzed.\n\nGiven the size and engagement, we believe this is the single biggest developer\ncommunity-building opportunity on the planet right now, so naturally, it's\nbeen exciting to pursue this partnership and to (finally!) share it with you\nall today.\n\nAs we'll be 100% focused on our mission at Postman, we will be winding down\nthe Orbit product as you know it today. We realize this affects our current\nusers and customers, and we'll be doing everything we can to help you migrate\nand export data smoothly. For API builders, some of what you've come to love\nin Orbit may be available soon on the API Network, so follow Postman channels\nand we will keep you updated on when things become available.\n\n### Here are some key points:\n\n  * The current Orbit product will be shutting down, and Orbit users have 90 days to wind down their use of Orbit and export their data\n  * On May 31 we will stop ingesting new data, but you will still have access to explore and export your data until July 11\n  * Existing customers will get support during the 90-day period, and customers who prepaid annually will receive prorated refunds\n  * The Orbit team will be working on the Postman API Network, building new tools to help API publishers grow their developer communities\n\n\ud83d\udc9c Thank you to our community, users, customers, and investors\n\nBefore diving deeper, Josh and I want to thank all of our customers, friends,\nand investors for collaborating with us over the past four years. We\u2019ve\nlearned tons from you all, and we can\u2019t wait to show you what\u2019s next.\n\nFor more information on what's next, keep reading\u2014and check out the\nannouncement over on the Postman blog.\n\n## An aligned mission\n\nThere are several reasons that my co-founder Josh and I (and our whole team!)\nare excited to continue our mission at Postman. For one, we both care a lot\nabout helping developers build awesome things. We both had formative\nexperiences working at API-first companies like Keen IO and Algolia, so we\nhave an appreciation for how hard it is to get every aspect of API developer\nexperience right \u2014 both the technical elements and the important yet harder-\nto-define elements like community and developer success.\n\nWe have also seen firsthand the challenges of driving adoption for an API,\nespecially when first getting started. In fact, from our very first investor\ndeck, we\u2019ve said that \u201cSoftware is no longer sold \u2014 it\u2019s adopted,\u201d and that\n\u201ccommunity is the engine that drives adoption.\u201d\n\nWe plan to address both of these areas \u2014 community and developer success, and\nthe resulting API adoption \u2014 at Postman.\n\nFor example, today, Postman public workspaces have made the onboarding,\ndevelopment, and testing parts\u2014AKA the technical parts\u2014of API DX so much\nbetter. Not to mention collaboration, releasing updates, and many other parts\nof the API development lifecycle.\n\nWith Orbit, we know we can help with the other area of DX; let's call it the\nhuman-to-human DX. How do we know if an API has good human-to-human DX? A few\nexamples:\n\n  * How long it takes to get questions answered\n  * The quality and authority of the answers\n  * How informed and supported developers feel they are\n\nThese are the kind of questions, and improvements, that Orbit has been helping\ncommunities make since we got underway in 2019, via champions programs,\nsupport programs, education initiatives, meetups and events, online community\nmanagement, and various other kinds of community programs out there.\n\nWe\u2019ve helped customers manage tens of millions of community members across\ntheir platforms, and now we\u2019re eager to take what we\u2019ve learned, and what\nwe\u2019ve built, and put it in service of the even larger API publisher and\ndeveloper communities using Postman.\n\n## FAQs\n\nWhat\u2019s happening with the current Orbit product?\n\nOver the coming months, Orbit technology will be integrated into the Postman\nAPI Network, where we\u2019ll be building experiences that help API publishers\nunderstand and serve their developer communities across platforms while also\nhelping developers discover great APIs and build relationships with their\npublishers.\n\nThat said, over the next 90 days, the existing Orbit product and platform will\nbe winding down. As of today, we won\u2019t allow new users or new workspaces to be\ncreated. Current users will be able to add users to your existing workspaces,\nas allowed by your plan type.\n\nOn May 31 we will stop ingesting new data, but you will still have access to\nexplore and export your data.\n\nOn July 11, we will disable all functionality.\n\nWhat will happen to my monthly or annual plan?\n\nIf you have prepaid for an annual subscription, we will reach out to refund\nthe prorated amount left on your current term. If you\u2019re on a monthly plan, we\nwill stop charging you at the end of May, and until then, you can cancel any\ntime.\n\nHow can I export my data?\n\nThere are two options. First, you can export a CSV of all your workspace data\nin your workspace settings.\n\nSecond, using the Orbit API, you can download all of your workspace data and\nsave it as JSON. Read the API docs here.\n\nFinally, if you have any questions, please reach out to our team at\nsupport@orbit.love.\n\nThanks again for an exciting few years, and we hope you come along with us for\nwhat\u2019s next!\n\n## Related Articles\n\nEngineering\n\n## Maximising Efficiency With LLMs: Leveraging ChatGPT-3.5 vs GPT-4\n\nAlex Morton\n\nEngineering\n\n## Capturing webhooks whilst your app is undergoing maintenance\n\nAnthony\n\nCommunity\n\n## Get in the L\u21bb\u21baP: a modern framework for Developer Enablement and Support\n\nJosh Dzielak\n\nProduct\n\n## Your community\u2019s knowledge: now searchable!\n\nJosh Dzielak\n\nProduct\n\nWhy OrbitPricingWhat\u2019s New\n\nResources\n\nKnowledge BaseDevelopersLearnPartner Program\n\nIntegrations\n\nDiscord\n\nDiscourse\n\nGitHub\n\nLinkedIn\n\nReddit\n\nSlack\n\nStack Overflow\n\nTwitter mentions\n\nZapier\n\nView All\n\nCompany\n\nAboutBlogCareersContactStatus\n\nGet closer to your customers with the Orbit Community Platform.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright Orbit Labs, Inc.
