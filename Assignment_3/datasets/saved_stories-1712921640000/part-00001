There are currently no approved therapies that\nspecifically target obesity-related heart failure with preserved ejection\nfraction in people with type 2 diabetes.\n\n\u201cObesity forms a \u2018common soil\u2019 that can lead to the development of heart\nfailure with preserved ejection fraction and type 2 diabetes, and patients\nliving with both conditions suffer from an especially high symptom burden but\nhave few available treatment options,\u201d said Dr. Mikhail Kosiborod, lead study\ninvestigator and cardiologist at Saint Luke\u2019s Mid America Heart Institute,\nKansas City, USA. \u201cToday\u2019s results, especially when combined with those from\nthe STEP-HFpEF trial, open a new chapter of targeting obesity as a new and\neffective treatment strategy in patients with obesity-related HFpEF, both with\nand without diabetes.\u201d\n\nThe mean change in the KCCQ-CSS was a 13.7-point increase at 52 weeks with\nsemaglutide 2.4 mg vs 6.4 points with placebo, leading to an estimated\ntreatment difference of 7.3 points (p<0.001). Mean change in body weight was a\n9.8% reduction with semaglutide 2.4 mg vs. 3.4% reduction with placebo,\nleading to an estimated treatment difference of 6.4% weight reduction\n(p<0.001).\n\nSTEP HFpEF DM also demonstrated a mean increase in 6-Minute Walking Distance\n(6MWD) of 12.7 meters at 52 weeks with semaglutide vs. a mean decrease of 1.6\nmeters with placebo leading to an estimated treatment difference of 14.3\nmeters (p=0.008). Semaglutide also reduced inflammation, as measured by the\nlevels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP).\n\nThe safety profile of semaglutide 2.4 mg was consistent with previous studies;\nfewer serious adverse events were observed with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared\nwith placebo.\n\nAbout heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), obesity and type\n2 diabetes There are 64 million people living with heart failure worldwide.\nHFpEF is now the most common form of heart failure, comprising approximately\n50% of all cases. Importantly, 80% of people with HFpEF also live with\noverweight or obesity and nearly half have type 2 diabetes.\n\nAbout STEP HFpEF Program The primary objective of STEP HFpEF Diabetes trial\nwas to investigate the effects of semaglutide 2.4 mg subcutaneous once-weekly\non symptoms, physical function, and body weight compared with placebo in\npatients with obesity-related HFpEF and Type 2 Diabetes. STEP HFpEF included\n616 people with symptomatic HFpEF (ejection fraction \u226545%) and obesity (BMI\n\u226530 kg/m2). Dual primary endpoints were change in KCCQ-CSS from baseline to\nweek 52 and change in body weight from baseline to week 52; with key secondary\nendpoints of change in 6MWD from baseline to week 52, hierarchical composite\nendpoint (all cause death, heart failure events, difference in KCCQ-CSS change\nand difference in 6MWD change from baseline to week 52), and change in\nC-reactive protein from baseline (screening) to week 52.\n\nThe previously published STEP HFpEF trial \u2013 another study of 529 participants\nwith obesity-related HFpEF but without type 2 diabetes \u2013 also demonstrated\nlarger reductions in heart failure-related symptoms and physical limitations,\ngreater improvement in exercise function, and greater degree of weight loss\nwith semaglutide versus placebo.\n\nAbout Saint Luke\u2019s Mid America Heart Institute Saint Luke\u2019s Mid America Heart\nInstitute, a part of Saint Luke\u2019s Health System and a teaching affiliate of\nthe University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Medicine, is one of the\ndistinguished cardiovascular programs in the country.
