We thought it might be helpful to\nreplicate the analysis for the Vancouver context.\n\nTaking ideas from the report we set up a simple counter-factual question:\n\nWhat would rents be if every apartment building built in Metro Vancouver over\nthe past five years had been on average 20% taller?\n\n# TL;DR\n\nWe estimate that planning decisions preventing apartment buildings built in\nthe past 5 years in Metro Vancouver from being on average 20% taller are\nresulting in an annual redistribution of income from renters to existing\nlandlords on the order of half a billion dollars across the region via higher\nrents.\n\n# Economics 101\n\nTo answer our counter-factual question, it\u2019s worth quickly reviewing some\nbasic economics concept. Firstly, the demand curve for housing slopes down.\nThat means that as the price or rent for housing falls, more people will look\nto buy or rent that housing. That generally leads more households to form,\ne.g. young adults moving out of their parent\u2019s basement or out of roommate or\nother complex household situations to form their own households. And it could\nmean some people that would have otherwise been pushed out are now able to\nstay, and some people deterred by high housing costs can move into our region.\nAnd the reverse of all that will happen if housing prices and rents rise.\n\nHow do we know this? Economic theory tells us demand curves generally slope\ndownward and both theory and data confirm the demographic implications. But to\nanswer our question we need to quantify this more precisely. If we increase\nour housing stock by some percentage, by what percentage will prices and rents\nchange? This is the (inverse) price elasticity of demand. It is the (inverse\nof the) slope to the demand curve, shown in black in the plot below, re-\nexpressed in terms of the percentage change of demand and supply.\n\nThese type of elasticities are notoriously difficult to identify. We are\ninterested in the \u201clong run\u201d effect, so effects after markets adjust to short-\nterm supply shocks. The report we cite above uses an estimate of -0.4 for\nSydney, and estimates done by CMHC for the whole province of British Columbia\nsuggest a similar value of around -0.5. We have previously estimated the price\nelasticity of demand for Metro Vancouver to be around -0.25, albeit with large\nconfidence intervals. For this analysis we will use the value of -0.4 which is\ncloser to what the broader literature suggests, with the understanding that\nthis estimate comes with uncertainties and actual effects might be a bit\nlarger or a bit smaller. For reference, an estimate of -0.4 is equivalent to\ncalculating that a 1% increase in supply would result in a 2.5% decrease in\nprices and rents. Since ours is a point estimate of price elasticity, these\neffects compound, and a 10% increase in supply would result in a 21% decrease\nin prices and rents.\n\nWe note that the supply curve in the graph above is to be taken with a grain\nof salt. While the demand curve for housing works roughly as one would expect,\ninsofar as housing is largely allocated via market mechanisms, the supply of\nhousing works differently. To list just two caveats, housing is a durable\ngood, with the market largely composed of existing, rather than newly\nproduced, housing. More importantly for our purposes, there are strong\nexternal constraints on how much new supply can be added through newly\nproduced housing. Even where supply curves suggest developers would happily\nadd more dwellings in response to prices, planning often prevents them from\ndoing so.\n\n# Height restrictions in Vancouver\n\nFor this post height limitation plays the role of a simple proxy for the\nrestrictiveness of zoning. A CMHC report from 2019 has found that height\nrestrictions are strongly binding in Vancouver, meaning a developer would be\nvery likely to build taller if they were allowed to do so.\n\nThe effect of zoning restrictions is generally difficult to observe when only\nlooking at development proposals that make it into the city approval process,\nbut we can still see some of the effect of height restrictions play out there.\n\nFor example the development at 1535-1557 Grant Street was initially proposed\nas a 6 storey apartment building as in principle enabled under the Grandview-\nWoodland community plan, but was subsequently cut down to 5 storeys in \u201cdirect\nresponse\u201d to Urban Design Panel & staff review.\n\nThe project at 1805 Larch brought forward under the Moderate Income Rental\nHousing Pilot Project went from six to five due to opposition at the pre-\napplication open house and was compelled to provide more parking spaces.\n\nThe development around 708 Renfrew Street proposed under the Affordable\nHousing Choices (AHC) Policy did not see a reduction in the nominal number of\nstoreys, but saw significant massing changes with the original proposal 43%\ntimes larger than the version that eventually got approved. However, the\nreduction in housing units seems to have ultimately proven fatal to the\nproject\u2019s viability, and the developer abandoned the project.\n\nThis motivates our counter-factual of trying to understand what would have\nhappened if recently constructed apartment buildings were on average 20%\ntaller, and had (roughly) 20% more units.\n\n# Apartment construction\n\nTo estimate the impact we look at historical apartment construction in Metro\nVancouver, and hypothetically add 20% more units for the past 5 years. This is\na rough estimate of what taller buildings could provide, of course. The math\nlinking unit numbers to heights can be more complicated. Taller buildings\nmight\u2019ve enabled more projects (like 708 Renfrew) to \u201cpencil\u201d potentially\nadding even more units than our estimate. On the other hand, CMHC also counts\nsecondary suites as \u201capartment units\u201d, which could lead to us overestimating,\nbut that likely only causes a small distortion in the stats.\n\nOverall, there were 81,317 apartment completions in the past 5 years. Had the\nbuildings containing these apartments been on average 20% taller there would\nhave been 16,263 additional housing units, resulting in an 1.5% increase in\ntotal housing stock in Metro Vancouver. Using our common demand elasticity\nassumption, that additional housing supply would have led to a reduction of\nprices and rents by 3.7%.\n\n# Impact on rents\n\nTo make this a little more concrete, we can use the average rent for 2-bedroom\nunits in Metro Vancouver with a new rental contract in the preceding year as a\nproxy for the average rent in the region and estimate the counter-factual\nrents.\n\nCMHC is now collecting information of rents of units with new rental\ncontracts, and the average such 2-bedroom unit in Metro Vancouver rented for\n$2,601 a month in 2023. If apartment buildings built during the past 5 years\nhad been on average 20% taller, then the average rent would have been $93 a\nmonth lower, saving the average new renter about $1,120 a year. For\ncomparison, BC\u2019s new Renter\u2019s Tax Credit maxes out at $400 per year.\n\nRents for long-time tenants tend to be lower than for new tenants under BC\u2019s\nrent control, reflecting Metro Vancouver\u2019s lengthy history of low vacancy\nrates driving rents for new contracts ever higher. Correspondingly, for\ntenants under existing rent-controlled tenancy agreements the benefits of\nadding supply are less direct than for new tenants. Long-time tenants\nprimarily experience additional supply effects in terms of increased choice\nand lower rents if they are looking to change their living arrangements\nbecause of a lower overall moving penalty. But they also potentially gain in\ntheir landlords becoming a little less keen to encourage turnover.\n\nAt this point it is useful to point out that the aggregate effect of the added\ncounter-factual housing is a net transfer of wealth from existing landlords to\ntenants. Rent control delays some of these effects, but scaling the rent\nsaving over the existing renter households in Metro Vancouver yields a net\ntransfer of $442M a year from existing landlords to tenants in terms of\naggregate rent savings.\n\n# Impact on broader housing outcomes\n\nOn top of that, the increase in housing stock will allow existing households\nto who are unhappy with their current living arrangements, for example adults\nliving with parents, or roommates, or other complex living arrangements, to\nmove into their own units. Toronto and Vancouver have elevated rates of such\nyoung adults not in \u201cMinimal Household units\u201d, and new housing units are\nneeded for these young adults to form their own households.\n\nThis under-appreciated benefit of increasing the housing stock allows\nindividuals and families to better match their housing to their needs and\npreferences.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nOne might be inclined to think that a reduction of average rents from $2,601\nto $2,508 a month is quite small. And we agree and believe that our counter-\nfactual increase in new housing by 20% is very modest. We should aim for a\nmuch larger increase in housing. Previous analysis we performed suggests\ndevelopers would have built enough units to increase our housing stock by\n250,000 units, or 23% if municipalities had let them. This would have resulted\nin a reduction of average rents by 40%, thus bringing Vancouver rents in line\nwith Canada-wide average CMA rent and resulting in enormous benefits to\nrenters.\n\nOur counter-factuals are purely hypothetical in the sense that we cannot turn\nback time and allow apartments that have already been built to be taller. But\nthey illustrate the the benefits of building more housing, and the harm of\nrestricting the amount of housing getting built.\n\nWe suspect that many municipal planners and politicians don\u2019t understand the\nextent of the harm to renters or new buyers they are causing by reducing the\nheight of buildings, or more generally by restricting the supply of housing.\nPlanning documents where planners give reasons for significantly reducing\nheight and form of proposed buildings, like the one for the MIRHPP at Larch\nand 3rd, are often justified largely on aesthetic grounds (\u201cSubstantial\nmassing change is required to provide a compatible form of development [...]\nin relation to the surrounding RT-8 and RM-4 developments\u201d) and do not seem to\nfully weigh or even consider the tradeoffs of the effects on rents and broader\nhousing outcomes, even in cases like this that contain dedicated below-market\nunits.\n\nThe other takeaway from this analysis is that affordability comes from supply\neffects. In terms of affordability, the purpose of new housing is to make old\nhousing cheaper. Often we hear people ask that new housing be affordable, or\nthat new housing should be targeted at specific income groups. This is\nentirely appropriate and important when it comes to dedicated non-market\nhousing. But trying to target new market housing at specific income bands\nfundamentally misunderstands housing, and is likely counter-productive. Or in\nthe words of Michael Manville:\n\n> If we believe that cheap housing matters and expensive housing doesn\u2019t, and\n> we act on that belief, our primary accomplishment will be to make our cheap\n> housing expensive.\n\nAnd not coincidentally we have been doing a bang-on job at making our cheap\nhousing expensive across Metro Vancouver.\n\nAs usual, the code for this post is available on GitHub for anyone to\nreproduce or adapt for their own purposes.\n\n  * Categories\n  * affordability\n  * Vancouver\n  * cmhc\n\n  * First time buyer Lorenz curves revisited\n\n### Recent Posts\n\n  * ### What if recent apartment buildings in Vancouver were 20% taller?\n\nApril 11, 2024\n\n  * ### First time buyer Lorenz curves revisited\n\nJanuary 16, 2024\n\n  * ### Housing Outcomes\n\nAugust 17, 2023\n\n  * ### Housing targets\n\nJune 27, 2023\n\n  * ### Metro Vancouver Planning Regimes\n\nJune 20, 2023\n\n  *     * View more posts\n\nTweets by @vb_jens\n\n### Categories\n\n  * vancouver 140\n  * cancensus 81\n  * censusmapper 68\n  * cansim 44\n  * zoning 28\n  * affordability 27\n  * rental 26\n  * assessment-data 25\n  * geeky 24\n  * cmhc 21\n  * density 21\n  * transportation 21\n  * empty-homes 20\n  * covid-19 19\n  * toronto 17\n  * land-use 16\n  * taxes 16\n  * osm 12\n  * newsfail 11\n  * mapzen 9\n  * bikes 8\n  * pumf 8\n  * tongfen 7\n  * surrey 6\n  * dotdensity 4\n  * teardowns 3\n  * canbank 1\n  * isochrones 1\n  * mobility 1\n  * wealth 1\n\n## About\n\nMountain Doodles is an insomnia driven MountainMath side project, born out of\nrandom questions, trying to give partial answers through data.\n\n  * Learn More\n\n\u00a9 Mountain Doodles.
