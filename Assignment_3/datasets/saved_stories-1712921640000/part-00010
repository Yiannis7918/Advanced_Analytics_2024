So,\nall blogs are now on Godaddy-managed WordPress. The migration has worked quite\nwell. Except for today, thej.in and social.thej.in went offline. I checked the\nserver it was up, but when I checked DNS, it returned nothing. I checked DNS\nrecords, and everything looked good. I have not changed anything in months.\nThen it occurred; I checked the Nameservers.\n\nThejesh GN @thej@social.thej.in\n\nUnfortunately, for this domain, I had used MediaTemple's name servers. It\nlooks like they finally brought down the MT's nameservers, which caused my DNS\nrecords to vanish. At least they should have checked how many of their hosted\ndomains use MT's nameservers before bringing it down. Anyway, I updated the\nDNS to use default Godaddy Nameservers now, so they are back.\n\nApr 12, 2024, 01:48 \u00b7 \u00b7 Web \u00b7 0 \u00b7 0\n\n2h\n\nThejesh GN @thej\n\nThis means I might have missed some toots.\n\nExploreLive feeds\n\nLogin to follow profiles or hashtags, favorite, share and reply to posts.
