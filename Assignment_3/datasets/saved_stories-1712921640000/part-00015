It's in this realm the real\nmonsters appear. Without enough real problems to go around, humans are prone\nto invent fictitious and dreadful ones.\n\nThis is the root of David Graeber's Bullshit Jobs analysis. That a shocking\npercentage of people work jobs that they themselves see little to no meaning\nin, because the work that's being produced makes no difference, has no\nessence. It's enough to make anyone mad.\n\nNow part of the problem is clearly one of perspective. I'm always amazed by\nthe pride and duty it appears most Japanese workers put into the most mundane\njobs. I forget where I read this, but it's the difference between being a\nhappy zoo keeper who think of their job as \"tending to the welfare of the\nelephants\" rather than just \"shoveling shit all day\".\n\nBut it's not all subjective either. We are biologically tuned to conserve\nenergy while being cognitively tuned to crave a challenge. So when the load is\nmaterial, we often wish it was lighter. But if we actually succeed in\nlightening the load, we wonder why we're unhappy.\n\nThis is one of those contradictory aspects of the human condition, and one\nthat's foolish to attempt to resolve. The trick I've found is to believe both\nthings to be true at the same time. Yes, occasionally there's a need to rest\nand conserve energy. But equally so, there's a need to get back into the\narena, and wrestle with something significant. Mojito island, all the time, is\na curse, not a blessing.\n\nAnd in fact, it probably is worse, for most people, to have too many stretches\nof too little to do than the opposite. Tales of workers dropping dead a year\ninto retirement is a common folklore expression of this knowledge.\n\nAll this to say: don't slice the few, meaningful problems you have at work too\nthin. The worst injury you can inflict on knowledge workers is leaving them\nwith too little of consequence to contest with.\n\nMeaningful problems are the most valuable human motivators. Made-up problems\nare a blight. Ensure you have not quite enough time and people available to\ntackle the former lest you start inventing the latter.\n\nAbout David Heinemeier Hansson\n\nMade Basecamp and HEY for the underdogs as co-owner and CTO of 37signals.\nCreated Ruby on Rails.
