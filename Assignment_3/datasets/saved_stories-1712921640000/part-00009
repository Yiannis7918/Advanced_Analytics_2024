To remedy this I've been thinking of making\ndiagrams DBMS specific. This will require the user to pick a DBMS before\nentering the editor after which all the supported datatypes will be available.\nThis, however, will only allow exporting to the SQL flavor that was selected\nin advance.On the other hand, we can have a limited set(more types can be\nadded but certainly not all) that get translated to their closest matches in\nall available SQL flavors.I want to hear your thoughts and opinions on how to\nproceed.Thank you:)  \n---  \nMake diagrams DBMS specific?Yes, pick a DBMS and stick with it100%No, make a\ngeneric diagram and export to anything0%1 vote \u00b7  \n  \nBeta Was this translation helpful?
