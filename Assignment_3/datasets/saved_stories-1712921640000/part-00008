While I don't want to dive too far into the\ntechnology, which is something I will do in a future post, this basically\nmeans I can follow Threads users that opt-in to Fediverse integration through\nmy Mastodon account.\n\nSo, I did what any \"normal\" person would do: I went to my Mastodon account and\nadded anyone I follow on Threads who had their Fediverse switch turned on so I\ncould see their posts on Mastodon. And then I started taking notes.\n\nThis is my journey that started as an experiment to see how my Threads feed\nwould look like on Mastodon and ended with me finding experiences that went\nabove and beyond my expectations.\n\n## Nothing is Perfect\n\nTo start, this post isn't a long-winded way of me saying I hate the Threads\nexperience. On the contrary, they've made some delightful choices. It's why\nI've been so active on the platform for this long.\n\nMy current need to look outward is more focused on what they haven't built and\nlikely never will. Nothing is perfect for everyone and neither is Threads.\n\nFirstly, the app always defaults to the For You feed. I think this makes sense\nfor most users, but it would be nice if power users were given the ability to\ndefault to a chronological feed.\n\nSpeaking of the chronological feed - frankly, it's not useful. It skips posts\nwithout explanation and there are no replies, which means no conversations in\nthat feed. You only see replies serendipitously in the For You feed so only\nThreads can decide which conversations you take part in.\n\nThere are also no lists. From the way it sounds, there will never be lists. I\ncan go on for hours about what makes lists useful - and boy, have I - but I'll\nsave that for another day. The point is, I use lists to make sense of the\nchronological feed - almost like a hand-crafted For You feed that...no, we're\nnot doing this today. The point is, I need lists and Threads doesn't seem to\nbe interested in catering to that need.\n\nFinally, the main reason I'm considering my options is the limited developer\nAPI. To put it short: there will be no third-party clients or augmentations of\nyour Threads feed. The feeds Threads gives you are the feeds you'll have to\nlive with. And, as I mentioned above, those feeds are not doing what I need\nthem to do.\n\nAnd so, I looked to the next biggest thing that will let me interact with\nThreads while giving me more options for how I consume my content: Mastodon.\n\n## Known Limitations\n\nIn this first phase, however, there is an important issue that will be ironed\nout once integration is complete: while Mastodon users can interact with\nThreads users, Threads users cannot interact back. That means:\n\n  1. Threads users can't reply to Mastodon comments or see them in Threads.\n  2. Threads users can be followed by Mastodon accounts but they will not be notified nor can they follow back.\n  3. Likes from Mastodon are not counted toward your Threads like count\n\nMoreover, as of writing this post, 189 out of 1524 of my Threads follow list\nis captured. While there may be more than what I currently have, that's about\n12% of my follow list. Based on my conversations with various users, it seems\nlike there are three popular reasons for why this may be the case:\n\n  1. It isn't rolled out in their region yet but they plan on switching it on.\n  2. They don't like the one-way integration and are waiting for full interaction with Mastodon users.\n  3. They don't like that there's a chance their post will remain indexed on Mastodon even if they delete it.\n\nThe first two will be solved, but the last one isn't going to be easy and it's\nnot in Meta's hands. I hope this changes in the future but I would understand\nif certain users didn't want to be spread across the internet that way.\n\nBut, knowing all this, I pushed forward to customize my experience.\n\n## Organizing the Chaos\n\nSo here I was - a Mastodon user who has about half his following list sourced\nfrom Threads. I started by moving all my Threads follows into a separate list\nso that it wouldn't fill my main Mastodon feed. I used the handy Mastodon List\nManager, segregated my Follows by domain, and added the whole threads.net\nsection to the Threads list. Then I switched on the Advanced UI (think\nTweetDeck for Mastodon) to get my real-time multi-column feed.\n\nThe reason for separating Threads users was to see how a real-time\nchronological feed for my Threads would actually look like. I also had to\ninteract with Threads posts differently since it's only one-way interaction\nfor this phase - I had to pop out of the Mastodon experience by opening the\npost on Threads and interacting there. Luckily, most Mastodon clients -\nincluding the default one - make this pretty easy and by separating my Threads\nfollows in an independent list, I could be consistent with that workflow.\n\nAs expected, the chronological feed became overwhelming to follow. But there\nwas an easy solution - I used lists. This made my feed easier to consume and\nit enabled me to focus on specific topics based on my mood. When I wanted to\nchat with online friends in the Tech Threads community, I would stay in a feed\ndedicated to that. If I was catching up on tech news, I would stay in that\nfeed. When I was ready for heavier news, I would head over to my politics\nfeed.\n\nIt was nice to able to decide what kind of content I wanted to consume rather\nthan getting an algorithm's scrambled egg of the day that doesn't consider\nwhat mood I'm in. But not all was perfect in my Mastodon experience, even if I\nput aside the one-way Threads limitation.\n\nThe main downside was that its UI is utility-first, design second. And coming\nfrom the polished Threads experience it left me a little unsatisfied. For\ninstance: if a user does a multi-post (a thread), they come in reverse\nchronological order; the same is for conversations. In my opinion, threads and\nconversations should be grouped together in the UI to keep context. This,\nalong with some other nits, left me wanting more.\n\n## The Client Search\n\nBut there's a major benefit to Mastodon: it provides a full API so that third-\nparty developers can augment the experience for specific needs, even niche\nones like mine. The lists manager I spoke about earlier is one example of\nthis. Flipboard is another for a links-focused view. And the many - there are\nSO many - third-party clients are all examples of how a user's needs can be\nmet even if the default options don't.\n\nWith an ample amount of choices, I set out to find a client that matched my\nneeds. I knew I wanted a few things that the Threads and Mastodon core\nexperiences weren't giving me: a prettier UI, a real-time feed, and better\nfeed grouping.\n\nAnd I had a final ask: an easy way to catch-up if I hadn't looked at my feed\nfor, say, 8 hours (a boy's gotta sleep, right?). What I wanted was something\nthat did what a For You feed does but doesn't leave me endlessly scrolling. I\nfigured I would find or build a separate tool since most clients would likely\nnot serve that and there was no reason to limit my search for something so\nniche.\n\nThere were numerous options that I enjoyed using quite a bit. To keep things\nshort, here were my favorites:\n\n  1. Elk - a minimalist PWA that makes some fantastic choices for the UX\n  2. Moshidon - an Android app that makes it easy to swipe between lists\n  3. Focus - a highly customizable Android app that includes a widget\n\nI don't have an iOS device, but I've heard Mammoth, Ice Cubes, and Ivory are\nall great options as well. But, as good as these experiences were, in one way\nor another they didn't scratch my itch.\n\nAnd then, I met Phanpy.\n\n## Hello, Phanpy\n\nFrom the moment I saw Phanpy, I knew this checked far more boxes than I was\nexpecting any client to.\n\nPhanpy can be as simple or a complex as you want it to be. Want a single feed\nthat refreshes when you explicitly ask it to? Default. Want multiple-columns\nhidden behind a tab bar? Easy. Want a multi-column, real-time chronological\nfeed? Go for you extremely-online feed addict (it me).\n\nPhanpy's column options\n\nIt most certainly doesn't stop there. As it brings new posts in real-time, it\nalso groups conversations and threads so you don't have to click around to get\nall the context you need to understand a single post. Here are two examples:\nthe first is a thread with replies in between and the second is a three-post\nthread.\n\nConversations and threads in Phanpy\n\nAnd sometimes there's multiple conversations happening at once - here's an\nexample of a lively discussion under a post:\n\nMultiple conversations under a post on Phanpy\n\nClean and easy to understand. And when a reply pops up in the feed, it brings\ncontextual groups with it. It makes the chronological feed so much easier to\nfollow, especially when you're running a multi-column dashboard. To make\nthings cleaner, original posts, replies, and reposts are all color coded to\nwhite, yellow, and purple respectively which helps break down the complex\nnature of microblogging feeds.\n\nPost in white, reply in yellow, and boost in purple\n\nSo I'd found it: a pretty client that grouped posts in a real-time feed while\nmaking it easy for me to pop in and out of the Threads UI. And then Phanpy\nthrew this in front of me:\n\nPhanpy's \"Catch Up\" Feature\n\nWhat you're seeing in the GIF above is \"Catch Up\", a Beta feature of Phanpy\nthat collects all the posts in your feed between 1-12 hours (configurable per\ncatch-up) and organizes them in a more sane way. You can filter by user or by\npost type (single, repost, or reply), sort by various attributes, and it\nextracts out all the links so you can see what popular news stories were\nfilling your timeline for that period of time.\n\nIt's doing what a For You feed attempts to do but gives you the power of how\nyou consume it. It also saves these sessions so you can go back when you're\nready to check different parts of it, kind of like how I use my Tech and\nPolitics lists. I typically run this in the morning to catch up while having\nmy morning coffee. I also use it whenever I'm away from my feed for a while -\nworking, social events, family time etc.\n\nSomehow, I found a client that even hit my stretch goals. Did I mention it's a\nPWA so you don't have to download any apps? It just keeps getting better.\n\nLike everything, Phanpy isn't perfect. For one, Threads posts federate 5m\nafter posting but Phanpy will re-organize the feed chronologically. So if\nthere's a Mastodon post that's been around for 2m and a Threads post makes it\nto my feed, the Threads post gets inserted underneath the Mastodon one. It\nmakes sense but it's made me keep my Mastodon and Threads real-time feeds\nseparate for the most part.\n\nPhanpy also doesn't sync across devices which means that my preferences needed\nto be set up on each device I use it on. There's an experimental feature that\ndoes this, but since it uses my Mastodon profile notes I decided to hold off\nuntil it's production-ready.\n\nThere are some other limitations but overall, Phanpy hits enough notes for me\nthat it's hard to complain. The code is also completely open source so there's\nnothing stopping me from pulling it, making some changes, and hosting a\nbespoke version of the app just for me. Which I will likely do if I decide to\nmove to a Mastodon instance once Threads completely federates.\n\n## What now?\n\nAt this point, I haven't decided if I'll move my account off of Threads after\nfederation is complete. I think there's a lot going for Threads, especially on\nthe experience front. I also have a feeling that leaving Threads will mean\nleaving behind some people I follow since I'm pretty sure not everyone is\ngoing to turn the switch on, especially if Threads never adds the option to\nturn it on during the onboarding experience. I've made a lot of friends there\nand I would hate to cut the cord completely. But after experiencing Phanpy,\nit'll be very hard to go back.\n\nMeta's goal was always to build something Twitter-like, but for a billion\nusers. The reason Twitter never hit that peak is because normal users didn't\nunderstand it. From what I can tell, the design decisions Threads is making\nare for those consumers: a single For You algorithm, no real-time feed, and -\nsay it with me - no lists. This basic experience will suffice for the 90% of\nusers that mostly lurk, comment, and like and don't want all the hurdles of\nunderstanding how any of it works. They're the ones that open an app like\nThreads once every few hours, scroll until they're done with it, then move on.\n\nIf that's their goal, then - in my opinion - they're succeeding in making all\nthe right decisions for that user.\n\nUnfortunately, I am not that user. I know many people on Threads who are not\nthat user. And I appreciate that Meta has opened itself up to let users like\nme interact with and send content to Threads from an experience that works for\nthem without being limited to Meta's vertical experience. What a time to be\nalive, right?\n\nAfter seeing the already-rich ecosystem of third-party clients - many of whom\nserve power-users and creators much better than Threads currently does - along\nwith Meta's decision not to allow third-party clients at all, I'm heavily\nleaning toward Phanpy for Mastodon for the long-term once Threads federates.\n\nHonestly, though - would lists really be that bad, Meta?\n\n### Subscribe to augment\n\nSign up now to get access to the library of members-only issues.\n\nJamie Larson\n\nSubscribe\n\naugment \u00a9 2024\n\nPowered by Ghost\n\n", "frontpage": true}
