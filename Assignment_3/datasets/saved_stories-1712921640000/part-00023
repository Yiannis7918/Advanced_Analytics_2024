Does your network have a really low-\nbandwidth connection, such that everyone, even accessing the same web pages,\nsuffers from slow downloads? Have you ever run a website, only to find that\nsuddenly you get hit with a spike of thousands of requests, overloading your\nserver and possibly causing high monthly bills? If so, CoralCDN might be your\nfree solution for these problems!\n\n## Using CoralCDN\n\nTaking advantage of CoralCDN is simple. Just append\n\nto the hostname of any URL, and your request for that URL is handled by\nCoralCDN! Try our project page, or any other site:\n\n    \n    \n    .nyud.net\n\n## What is CoralCDN?\n\nCoralCDN is a free and open content distribution network based around peer-to-\npeer technologies, comprised of a world-wide network of web proxies and\nnameservers. It allows a user to run a web site that offers high performance\nand meets huge demand, all for the price of a $50/month cable modem.\n\nPublishing through CoralCDN is as simple as appending a short string to the\nhostname of objects' URLs; a peer-to-peer DNS layer transparently redirects\nbrowsers to participating caching proxies, which in turn cooperate to minimize\nload on the source web server. CoralCDN proxies automatically replicate\ncontent as a side effect of users accessing it, improving its availability.\nUsing modern peer-to-peer indexing techniques, CoralCDN will efficiently find\na cached object if it exists anywhere in the network, requiring that it use\nthe origin server only to initially fetch the object once.\n\nOne of CoralCDN's key goals is to avoid ever creating hot spots in its\ninfrastructure. It achieves this through a novel indexing abstraction we\nintroduce called a distributed sloppy hash table (DSHT), and it creates self-\norganizing clusters of nodes that fetch information from each other to avoid\ncommunicating with more distant or heavily-loaded servers.\n\nCoralCDN has been continuously operated since March 2004, running on 300-400\nservers on the PlanetLab testbed, spread worldwide. As of 2011, it receives\n25-50 million requests per day from a few million unique clients.\n\n(What's with the Google ads? Our Illuminati measurement project sought to\nunderstand how IP addresses and public information characterize Web clients.\nOne related question is how such information plays a role in pay-per-click\nadvertising, so we decided to run some ourselves to better understand how such\nsystems work.)\n\n", "frontpage": false}
