This would benefit both mobile developers and\nusers, Epic argued in a wide-sweeping proposal that would greatly limit\nGoogle's control over the Android app ecosystem.\n\nUS District Court Judge James Donato will ultimately decide the terms of the\ninjunction. Google has until May 3 to respond to Epic's filing.\n\nA Google spokesperson confirmed to Ars that Google still plans to appeal the\nverdict\u2014even though Google already agreed to a $700 million settlement with\nconsumers and states following Epic's win.\n\n\"Epic\u2019s filing to the US Federal Court shows again that it simply wants the\nbenefits of Google Play without having to pay for it,\" Google's spokesperson\nsaid. \"We\u2019ll continue to challenge the verdict, as Android is an open mobile\nplatform that faces fierce competition from the Apple App Store, as well as\napp stores on Android devices, PCs, and gaming consoles.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Donato accepts Epic's proposal, Google would be required to grant equal\naccess to the Android operating system and platform features to all\ndevelopers, not just developers distributing apps through Google Play. This\nwould allow third-party app stores to become the app update owner, updating\nany apps downloaded from their stores as seamlessly as Google Play updates\napps.\n\nUnder Epic's terms, any app downloaded from anywhere would operate identically\nto apps downloaded from Google Play, without Google imposing any unnecessary\ndistribution fees. Similarly, developers would be able to provide their own\nin-app purchasing options and inform users of out-of-app purchasing options,\nwithout having to use Google's APIs or paying Google additional fees.\n\nNotably, Epic filed its lawsuit after Google removed the Epic game Fortnite\nfrom the Google Play Store because Epic tried to offer an \"Epic Direct\nPayment\" option for in-game purchases.\n\n\"Google must also allow developers to communicate directly with their\nconsumers, including linking from their app to a website to make purchases and\nget deals,\" Epic said in a blog post. \"Google would be blocked from using sham\ncompliance programs like User Choice Billing to prevent competing payment\noptions inside an app or on a developer\u2019s website.\"\n\nUnsurprisingly, Epic's proposed injunction includes an \"anti-retaliation\"\nsection specifically aimed at protecting Epic from any further retaliation. If\nDonato accepts the terms, Google would be violating the injunction order if\nthe tech giant fails to prove that it is not \"treating Epic differently than\nother developers\" by making it \"disproportionately difficult or costly\" for\nEpic to develop, update, and market its apps on Android.\n\nThat part of the injunction would seem important since, last month, Epic\nannounced that an Epic Games Store was \"coming to iOS and Android\" later this\nyear. According to Inc, Epic told Game Developers Conference attendees that\nits app-distribution platform will be the \"first ever game-focused,\nmultiplatform store,\" working across \"Android, iOS, PC and macOS.\"\n\n#### reader comments\n\n126\n\nAshley Belanger Ashley is a senior policy reporter for Ars Technica, dedicated\nto tracking social impacts of emerging policies and new technologies.
