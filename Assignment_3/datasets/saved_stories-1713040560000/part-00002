The problem was posed by Johann Bernoulli in\n1696.\n\nThe brachistochrone curve is the same shape as the tautochrone curve; both are\ncycloids. However, the portion of the cycloid used for each of the two varies.\nMore specifically, the brachistochrone can use up to a complete rotation of\nthe cycloid (at the limit when A and B are at the same level), but always\nstarts at a cusp. In contrast, the tautochrone problem can use only up to the\nfirst half rotation, and always ends at the horizontal.^[2] The problem can be\nsolved using tools from the calculus of variations^[3] and optimal\ncontrol.^[4]\n\nThe curve is independent of both the mass of the test body and the local\nstrength of gravity. Only a parameter is chosen so that the curve fits the\nstarting point A and the ending point B.^[5] If the body is given an initial\nvelocity at A, or if friction is taken into account, then the curve that\nminimizes time differs from the tautochrone curve.\n\n## History[edit]\n\n### Galileo's problem[edit]\n\nEarlier, in 1638, Galileo Galilei had tried to solve a similar problem for the\npath of the fastest descent from a point to a wall in his Two New Sciences. He\ndraws the conclusion that the arc of a circle is faster than any number of its\nchords,^[6]\n\n> From the preceding it is possible to infer that the quickest path of all\n> [lationem omnium velocissimam], from one point to another, is not the\n> shortest path, namely, a straight line, but the arc of a circle.\n>\n> ...\n>\n> Consequently the nearer the inscribed polygon approaches a circle the\n> shorter the time required for descent from A to C. What has been proven for\n> the quadrant holds true also for smaller arcs; the reasoning is the same.\n\nJust after Theorem 6 of Two New Sciences, Galileo warns of possible fallacies\nand the need for a \"higher science\". In this dialogue Galileo reviews his own\nwork. Galileo studied the cycloid and gave it its name, but the connection\nbetween it and his problem had to wait for advances in mathematics.\n\nGalileo\u2019s conjecture is that \u201cThe shortest time of all [for a movable body]\nwill be that of its fall along the arc ADB [of a quarter circle] and similar\nproperties are to be understood as holding for all lesser arcs taken upward\nfrom the lowest limit B.\u201d\n\nIn Fig.1, from the \u201cDialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems\u201d, Galileo\nclaims that the body sliding along the circular arc of a quarter circle, from\nA to B will reach B in less time than if it took any other path from A to B.\nSimilarly, in Fig. 2, from any point D on the arc AB, he claims that the time\nalong the lesser arc DB will be less than for any other path from D to B. In\nfact, the quickest path from A to B or from D to B, the brachistochrone, is a\ncycloidal arc, which is shown in Fig. 3 for the path from A to B, and Fig.4\nfor the path from D to B, superposed on the respective circular arc. ^[7]\n\n### Introduction of the problem[edit]\n\nJohann Bernoulli posed the problem of the brachistochrone to the readers of\nActa Eruditorum in June, 1696.^[8]^[9] He said:\n\n> I, Johann Bernoulli, address the most brilliant mathematicians in the world.\n> Nothing is more attractive to intelligent people than an honest, challenging\n> problem, whose possible solution will bestow fame and remain as a lasting\n> monument. Following the example set by Pascal, Fermat, etc., I hope to gain\n> the gratitude of the whole scientific community by placing before the finest\n> mathematicians of our time a problem which will test their methods and the\n> strength of their intellect. If someone communicates to me the solution of\n> the proposed problem, I shall publicly declare him worthy of praise\n\nBernoulli wrote the problem statement as:\n\n> Given two points A and B in a vertical plane, what is the curve traced out\n> by a point acted on only by gravity, which starts at A and reaches B in the\n> shortest time.\n\nJohann and his brother Jakob Bernoulli derived the same solution, but Johann's\nderivation was incorrect, and he tried to pass off Jakob's solution as his\nown.^[10] Johann published the solution in the journal in May of the following\nyear, and noted that the solution is the same curve as 's tautochrone curve.\nAfter deriving the differential equation for the curve by the method given\nbelow, he went on to show that it does yield a cycloid.^[11]^[12] However, his\nproof is marred by his use of a single constant instead of the three\nconstants, v_m, 2g and D, below.\n\nBernoulli allowed six months for the solutions but none were received during\nthis period. At the request of Leibniz, the time was publicly extended for a\nyear and a half.^[13] At 4 p.m. on 29 January 1697 when he arrived home from\nthe Royal Mint, Isaac Newton found the challenge in a letter from Johann\nBernoulli.^[14] Newton stayed up all night to solve it and mailed the solution\nanonymously by the next post. Upon reading the solution, Bernoulli immediately\nrecognized its author, exclaiming that he \"recognizes a lion from his claw\nmark\". This story gives some idea of Newton's power, since Johann Bernoulli\ntook two weeks to solve it.^[5]^[15] Newton also wrote, \"I do not love to be\ndunned [pestered] and teased by foreigners about mathematical things...\", and\nNewton had already solved Newton's minimal resistance problem, which is\nconsidered the first of the kind in calculus of variations.\n\nIn the end, five mathematicians responded with solutions: Newton, Jakob\nBernoulli, Gottfried Leibniz, Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus and Guillaume\nde l'H\u00f4pital. Four of the solutions (excluding l'H\u00f4pital's) were published in\nthe same edition of the journal as Johann Bernoulli's. In his paper, Jakob\nBernoulli gave a proof of the condition for least time similar to that below\nbefore showing that its solution is a cycloid.^[11] According to Newtonian\nscholar Tom Whiteside, in an attempt to outdo his brother, Jakob Bernoulli\ncreated a harder version of the brachistochrone problem. In solving it, he\ndeveloped new methods that were refined by Leonhard Euler into what the latter\ncalled (in 1766) the calculus of variations. Joseph-Louis Lagrange did further\nwork that resulted in modern infinitesimal calculus.\n\n## Johann Bernoulli's solution[edit]\n\n### Introduction[edit]\n\nIn a letter to L\u2019H\u00f4pital, (21/12/1696), Bernoulli stated that when considering\nthe problem of the curve of quickest descent, after only 2 days he noticed a\ncurious affinity or connection with another no less remarkable problem leading\nto an \u2018indirect method\u2019 of solution. Then shortly afterwards he discovered a\n\u2018direct method\u2019. ^[16]\n\n### Direct method[edit]\n\nIn a letter to Henri Basnage, held at the University of Basel Public Library,\ndated 30 March 1697, Johann Bernoulli stated that he had found two methods\n(always referred to as \"direct\" and \"indirect\") to show that the\nBrachistochrone was the \"common cycloid\", also called the \"roulette\".\nFollowing advice from Leibniz, he included only the indirect method in the\nActa Eruditorum Lipsidae of May 1697. He wrote that this was partly because he\nbelieved it was sufficient to convince anyone who doubted the conclusion,\npartly because it also resolved two famous problems in optics that \"the late\nMr. Huygens\" had raised in his treatise on light. In the same letter he\ncriticised Newton for concealing his method.\n\nIn addition to his indirect method he also published the five other replies to\nthe problem that he received.\n\nJohann Bernoulli's direct method is historically important as a proof that the\nbrachistochrone is the cycloid. The method is to determine the curvature of\nthe curve at each point. All the other proofs, including Newton's (which was\nnot revealed at the time) are based on finding the gradient at each point.\n\nIn 1718, Bernoulli explained how he solved the brachistochrone problem by his\ndirect method.^[17]^[18]\n\nHe explained that he had not published it in 1697, for reasons that no longer\napplied in 1718. This paper was largely ignored until 1904 when the depth of\nthe method was first appreciated by Constantin Carath\u00e9odory, who stated that\nit shows that the cycloid is the only possible curve of quickest descent.\nAccording to him, the other solutions simply implied that the time of descent\nis stationary for the cycloid, but not necessarily the minimum possible.\n\n#### Analytic solution[edit]\n\nA body is regarded as sliding along any small circular arc Ce between the\nradii KC and Ke, with centre K fixed. The first stage of the proof involves\nfinding the particular circular arc, Mm, which the body traverses in the\nminimum time.\n\nThe line KNC intersects AL at N, and line Kne intersects it at n, and they\nmake a small angle CKe at K. Let NK = a, and define a variable point, C on KN\nextended. Of all the possible circular arcs Ce, it is required to find the arc\nMm, which requires the minimum time to slide between the 2 radii, KM and Km.\nTo find Mm Bernoulli argues as follows.\n\nLet MN = x. He defines m so that MD = mx, and n so that Mm = nx + na and notes\nthat x is the only variable and that m is finite and n is infinitely small.\nThe small time to travel along arc Mm is , which has to be a minimum (\u2018un plus\npetit\u2019). He does not explain that because Mm is so small the speed along it\ncan be assumed to be the speed at M, which is as the square root of MD, the\nvertical distance of M below the horizontal line AL.\n\nIt follows that, when differentiated this must give\n\n    so that x = a.\n\nThis condition defines the curve that the body slides along in the shortest\ntime possible. For each point, M on the curve, the radius of curvature, MK is\ncut in 2 equal parts by its axis AL. This property, which Bernoulli says had\nbeen known for a long time, is unique to the cycloid.\n\nFinally, he considers the more general case where the speed is an arbitrary\nfunction X(x), so the time to be minimised is . The minimum condition then\nbecomes which he writes as : and which gives MN (=x) as a function of NK (=\na). From this the equation of the curve could be obtained from the integral\ncalculus, though he does not demonstrate this.\n\n#### Synthetic solution[edit]\n\nHe then proceeds with what he called his Synthetic Solution, which was a\nclassical, geometrical proof, that there is only a single curve that a body\ncan slide down in the minimum time, and that curve is the cycloid.\n\nThe reason for the synthetic demonstration, in the manner of the ancients, is\nto convince Mr de la Hire. He has little time for our new analysis, describing\nit as false (He claims he has found 3 ways to prove that the curve is a cubic\nparabola) \u2013 Letter from Johan Bernoulli to Pierre Varignon dated 27 Jul 1697.\n^[19]\n\nAssume AMmB is the part of the cycloid joining A to B, which the body slides\ndown in the minimum time. Let ICcJ be part of a different curve joining A to\nB, which can be closer to AL than AMmB. If the arc Mm subtends the angle MKm\nat its centre of curvature, K, let the arc on IJ that subtends the same angle\nbe Cc. The circular arc through C with centre K is Ce. Point D on AL is\nvertically above M. Join K to D and point H is where CG intersects KD,\nextended if necessary.\n\nLet and t be the times the body takes to fall along Mm and Ce respectively.\n\n    , ,\n\nExtend CG to point F where, and since , it follows that\n\nSince MN = NK, for the cycloid:\n\n    , , and\n\nIf Ce is closer to K than Mm then\n\n    and\n\nIn either case,\n\n    , and it follows that\n\nIf the arc, Cc subtended by the angle infinitesimal angle MKm on IJ is not\ncircular, it must be greater than Ce, since Cec becomes a right-triangle in\nthe limit as angle MKm approaches zero.\n\nNote, Bernoulli proves that CF > CG by a similar but different argument.\n\nFrom this he concludes that a body traverses the cycloid AMB in less time than\nany other curve ACB.\n\n### Indirect method[edit]\n\nAccording to Fermat\u2019s principle, the actual path between two points taken by a\nbeam of light is one that takes the least time. In 1697 Johann Bernoulli used\nthis principle to derive the brachistochrone curve by considering the\ntrajectory of a beam of light in a medium where the speed of light increases\nfollowing a constant vertical acceleration (that of gravity g).^[20]\n\nBy the conservation of energy, the instantaneous speed of a body v after\nfalling a height y in a uniform gravitational field is given by:\n\n    ,\n\nThe speed of motion of the body along an arbitrary curve does not depend on\nthe horizontal displacement.\n\nBernoulli noted that the law of refraction gives a constant of the motion for\na beam of light in a medium of variable density:\n\n    ,\n\nwhere v_m is the constant and represents the angle of the trajectory with\nrespect to the vertical.\n\nThe equations above lead to two conclusions:\n\n  1. At the onset, the angle must be zero when the particle speed is zero. Hence, the brachistochrone curve is tangent to the vertical at the origin.\n  2. The speed reaches a maximum value when the trajectory becomes horizontal and the angle \u03b8 = 90\u00b0.\n\nAssuming for simplicity that the particle (or the beam) with coordinates (x,y)\ndeparts from the point (0,0) and reaches maximum speed after falling a\nvertical distance D:\n\n    .\n\nRearranging terms in the law of refraction and squaring gives:\n\nwhich can be solved for dx in terms of dy:\n\n    .\n\nSubstituting from the expressions for v and v_m above gives:\n\nwhich is the differential equation of an inverted cycloid generated by a\ncircle of diameter D=2r, whose parametric equation is:\n\nwhere \u03c6 is a real parameter, corresponding to the angle through which the\nrolling circle has rotated. For given \u03c6, the circle's centre lies at (x, y) =\n(r\u03c6, r).\n\nIn the brachistochrone problem, the motion of the body is given by the time\nevolution of the parameter:\n\nwhere t is the time since the release of the body from the point (0,0).\n\n## Jakob Bernoulli's solution[edit]\n\nJohann's brother Jakob showed how 2nd differentials can be used to obtain the\ncondition for least time. A modernized version of the proof is as follows. If\nwe make a negligible deviation from the path of least time, then, for the\ndifferential triangle formed by the displacement along the path and the\nhorizontal and vertical displacements,\n\n    .\n\nOn differentiation with dy fixed we get,\n\n    .\n\nAnd finally rearranging terms gives,\n\nwhere the last part is the displacement for given change in time for 2nd\ndifferentials. Now consider the changes along the two neighboring paths in the\nfigure below for which the horizontal separation between paths along the\ncentral line is d^2x (the same for both the upper and lower differential\ntriangles). Along the old and new paths, the parts that differ are,\n\nFor the path of least times these times are equal so for their difference we\nget,\n\nAnd the condition for least time is,\n\nwhich agrees with Johann's assumption based on the law of refraction.\n\n## Newton's solution[edit]\n\n### Introduction[edit]\n\nIn June 1696, Johann Bernoulli had used the pages of the Acta Eruditorum\nLipsidae to pose a challenge to the international mathematical community: to\nfind the form of the curve joining two fixed points so that a mass will slide\ndown along it, under the influence of gravity alone, in the minimum amount of\ntime. The solution was originally to be submitted within six months. At the\nsuggestion of Leibniz, Bernoulli extended the challenge until Easter 1697, by\nmeans of a printed text called \"Programma\", published in Groningen, in the\nNetherlands.\n\nThe Programma is dated 1 January 1697, in the Gregorian Calendar. This was 22\nDecember 1696 in the Julian Calendar, in use in Britain. According to Newton's\nniece, Catherine Conduitt, Newton learned of the challenge at 4 pm on 29\nJanuary and had solved it by 4 am the following morning. His solution,\ncommunicated to the Royal Society, is dated 30 January. This solution, later\npublished anonymously in the Philosophical Transactions, is correct but does\nnot indicate the method by which Newton arrived at his conclusion. Bernoulli,\nwriting to Henri Basnage in March 1697, indicated that even though its author,\n\"by an excess of modesty\", had not revealed his name, yet even from the scant\ndetails supplied it could be recognised as Newton's work, \"as the lion by its\nclaw\" (in Latin, ex ungue Leonem).\n\nD. T. Whiteside notes that the letter in French has ex ungue Leonem preceded\nby the French word comme. The much quoted version tanquam ex ungue Leonem is\ndue to David Brewster's 1855 book on the life and works of Newton. Bernoulli's\nintention was, Whiteside argues, simply to indicate he could tell the\nanonymous solution was Newton's, just as it was possible to tell that an\nanimal was a lion given its claw; it was not meant to suggest that Bernoulli\nconsidered Newton to be the lion among mathematicians, as it has since come to\nbe interpreted.^[21]\n\nJohn Wallis, who was 80 years old at the time, had learned of the problem in\nSeptember 1696 from Johann Bernoulli's youngest brother Hieronymus, and had\nspent three months attempting a solution before passing it in December to\nDavid Gregory, who also failed to solve it. After Newton had submitted his\nsolution, Gregory asked him for the details and made notes from their\nconversation. These can be found in the University of Edinburgh Library,\nmanuscript A , dated 7 March 1697. Either Gregory did not understand Newton's\nargument, or Newton's explanation was very brief. However, it is possible,\nwith a high degree of confidence, to construct Newton's proof from Gregory's\nnotes, by analogy with his method to determine the solid of minimum resistance\n(Principia, Book 2, Proposition 34, Scholium 2). A detailed description of his\nsolution of this latter problem is included in the draft of a letter in 1694,\nalso to David Gregory.^[22] In addition to the minimum time curve problem,\nthere was a second problem that Newton also solved at the same time. Both\nsolutions appeared anonymously in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal\nSociety, for January 1697.\n\n### The Brachistochrone problem[edit]\n\nFig. 1, shows Gregory\u2019s diagram (except the additional line IF is absent from\nit, and Z, the start point has been added). The curve ZVA is a cycloid and CHV\nis its generating circle. Since it appears that the body is moving upward from\ne to E, it must be assumed that a small body is released from Z and slides\nalong the curve to A, without friction, under the action of gravity.\n\nConsider a small arc eE, which the body is ascending. Assume that it traverses\nthe straight line eL to point L, horizontally displaced from E by a small\ndistance, o, instead of the arc eE. Note, that eL is not the tangent at e, and\nthat o is negative when L is between B and E. Draw the line through E parallel\nto CH, cutting eL at n. From a property of the cycloid, En is the normal to\nthe tangent at E, and similarly the tangent at E is parallel to VH.\n\nSince the displacement EL is small, it differs little in direction from the\ntangent at E so that the angle EnL is close to a right-angle. In the limit as\nthe arc eE approaches zero, eL becomes parallel to VH, provided o is small\ncompared to eE making the triangles EnL and CHV similar.\n\nAlso en approaches the length of chord eE, and the increase in length, ,\nignoring terms in and higher, which represent the error due to the\napproximation that eL and VH are parallel.\n\nThe speed along eE or eL can be taken as that at E, proportional to , which is\nas CH, since\n\nThis appears to be all that Gregory\u2019s note contains.\n\nLet t be the additional time to reach L,\n\nTherefore, the increase in time to traverse a small arc displaced at one\nendpoint depends only on the displacement at the endpoint and is independent\nof the position of the arc. However, by Newton\u2019s method, this is just the\ncondition required for the curve to be traversed in the minimum time possible.\nTherefore, he concludes that the minimum curve must be the cycloid.\n\nHe argues as follows.\n\nAssuming now that Fig. 1 is the minimum curve not yet determined, with\nvertical axis CV, and the circle CHV removed, and Fig. 2 shows part of the\ncurve between the infinitesimal arc eE and a further infinitesimal arc Ff a\nfinite distance along the curve. The extra time, t, to traverse eL (rather\nthan eE) is nL divided by the speed at E (proportional to ), ignoring terms in\nand higher:\n\n,\n\nAt L the particle continues along a path LM, parallel to the original EF, to\nsome arbitrary point M. As it has the same speed at L as at E, the time to\ntraverse LM is the same as it would have been along the original curve EF. At\nM it returns to the original path at point f. By the same reasoning, the\nreduction in time, T, to reach f from M rather than from F is\n\nThe difference (t \u2013 T) is the extra time it takes along the path eLMf compared\nto the original eEFf :\n\nplus terms in and higher (1)\n\nBecause eEFf is the minimum curve, (t \u2013 T) is must be greater than zero,\nwhether o is positive or negative. It follows that the coefficient of o in (1)\nmust be zero:\n\n(2) in the limit as eE and fF approach zero. Note since eEFf is the minimum\ncurve it has to be assumed that the coefficient of is greater than zero.\n\nClearly there has to be 2 equal and opposite displacements, or the body would\nnot return to the endpoint, A, of the curve.\n\nIf e is fixed, and if f is considered a variable point higher up the curve,\nthen for all such points, f, is constant (equal to ). By keeping f fixed and\nmaking e variable it is clear that is also constant.\n\nBut, since points, e and f are arbitrary, equation (2) can be true only if ,\neverywhere, and this condition characterises the curve that is sought. This is\nthe same technique he uses to find the form of the Solid of Least Resistance.\n\nFor the cycloid, , so that , which was shown above to be constant, and the\nBrachistochrone is the cycloid.\n\nNewton gives no indication of how he discovered that the cycloid satisfied\nthis last relation. It may have been by trial and error, or he may have\nrecognised immediately that it implied the curve was the cycloid.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Mathematics portal\n  * Physics portal\n\n  * Aristotle's wheel paradox\n  * Beltrami identity\n  * Calculus of variations\n  * Catenary\n  * Newton's minimal resistance problem\n  * Trochoid\n  * Uniformly accelerated motion\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Chisholm, Hugh, ed.
