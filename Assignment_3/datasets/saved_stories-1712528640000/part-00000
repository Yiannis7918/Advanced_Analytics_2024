But new research shows that\ncouldn\u2019t be further from the truth\u2014the youth of today just don\u2019t want a desk\njob.\n\nThat\u2019s because the youngest generation of workers is shunning college (and\nwith it, the prospect of a corporate career) to take up traditional trades\nlike welding, plumbing, and carpentry.\n\nEnrollment in vocational-focused community colleges rose 16% last year to its\nhighest level since the National Student Clearinghouse began tracking such\ndata in 2018.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the same data shows a 23% surge in students studying construction\ntrades in 2023 compared to the year before, and a 7% increase in HVAC and\nvehicle maintenance and repair programs.\n\nWhy the shift? \u201cPeople are starting to pay attention,\u201d Mike Rowe, the CEO of\nMikeRoweWorks Foundation, a charity that challenges stigma and stereotypes\nagainst no-degree jobs, told Fox Business.\n\n\u201cParents and kids alike are starting to get the message that trade school is\nan amazing opportunity with just a fraction of the debt\u2014if any at all\u2014and a\nclear path to something that looks a lot like prosperity.\u201d\n\n## Students were \u2018sold a lie\u2019\n\nWith college setting students back an average of $36,436 per year, young\npeople today are questioning the return on investment they\u2019ll get on the\nqualification.\n\n\u201cPeople are starting to smell a rat,\u201d Rowe quipped, adding that blue-collar\njobs \u201care a straight path to a six-figure job\u201d without the burden of debt.\n\nRead more: More people are taking on second jobs because they literally can\u2019t\nafford not to\n\nIf you want proof, look no further than the fastest-growing job in the U.S.\nright now\u2014wind turbine service technician\u2014which pays up to $103,000 a year and\ndoesn\u2019t require a college degree.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the median pay for new construction hires was $48,089 last year,\ncompared to $39,520 for professional services new hires, according to data\nfrom payroll services provider ADP.\n\n\u201cGen Z is just starting to realize they\u2019ve been pushed in a direction that\nfrankly doesn\u2019t lead to a place they want to go,\u201d Rowe said.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder that trust in universities has sunk to an all-time low.\nMeanwhile, millennials (who are the most educated generation in history) feel\nlike they\u2019ve been \u201csold a lie,\u201d and 24% of Americans with student loan debt\nsay it\u2019s their biggest financial regret.\n\n> @robbiesmoonmusic\n>\n> if you get it, you get it. if you don\u2019t, thank God for that. #capitalism\n> #genz #millennial #boomer\n>\n> \u266c original sound \u2013 robbie scott\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s sh-tty is, we\u2019re holding up our end of the deal,\u201d 27-year-old Robbie\nScott cried in a viral TikTok video that struck a chord with many young\npeople. \u201cWe\u2019re staying in school. We\u2019re going to college. We\u2019ve been working\nsince we were 15, 16 years old...doing everything that y\u2019all told us to do so\nthat we can what? Still be living in our parents\u2019 homes in our late twenties?\u201d\n\nSo it\u2019s hardly surprising that Gen Z feels disenfranchised with the American\ndream of working hard at a soulless desk for the next 50-plus years, after\nwasting their youth studying for what seems like little gain.\n\n## But if you want to earn top dollar, college is still a safe bet\n\nStill, although it may be tempting to \u201cwork hard, play hard\u201d straight out of\nhigh school, reams of research show that those who want to earn the big bucks\nneed a ritzy college degree.\n\nLadders, the career site for six-figure jobs, analyzed the top-paid positions\nposted on its platform and found that the majority require an advanced degree.\n\nBut don\u2019t be fooled into thinking all degrees are created equally: Although it\ncosts the same to study psychology and liberal arts as it does computer\nscience, some college majors are more likely to result in a lucrative salary\nthan others.\n\nThe New York Fed studied the labor market outcomes of college graduates\ndepending on their major and computer engineering grads came out on top.\nLadders\u2019 data highlighted that those earning over the $200,000 benchmark\nstudied medicine. Meanwhile, accountancy jobs are also hot right now\u2014but most\nopenings require a bachelor\u2019s degree.\n\nSubscribe to the CEO Daily newsletter to get the CEO perspective on the\nbiggest headlines in business.
