I was on many late-night calls with Microsoft engineers diagnosing\nincidents & trying to figure out \"what the hell is going on with Azure?\" My\nteams worked heavily with Azure, too, and together, we built systems that\nscaled to millions of customers.\n\nAll of this led me to believe that maybe, just maybe, I could write a book on\nAzure. And so I started and very quickly got to about 80% done.\n\nBut then COVID hit, and I got busy at work. My teams got really busy\nmodernizing Walmart Pharmacy Tech, and I put the book to the side for a time.\nExcuses, excuses, of course. Well, they\u2019re not excuses because they're not\ntrue, but if I had just gotten the book done then, I'd now have the book and\nwouldn't need to tell you the rest of this sad story.\n\nBut then, in 2021, after I quit that job to pursue entrepreneurship, I thought\nto myself, \"Wouldn't it be nice if I had that book on Azure out there? After\nall, it's 80% done, and it may make a few dollars. It's the perfect small\nbet.\" So I dusted it up and tried to finish it off.\n\nBut as I read through this book I'd written all the way back in 2019, I\nthought, \"This reads like crap; you are a better writer now; you should\nrewrite this!\" So, I tried to rewrite it, but I didn't get very far. Rewriting\nsomething you wrote a long time ago turns out to be tedious and un-enjoyable.\n\nThen I took a course on writing books & publishing them through KDP, and I had\nmy new friend Greg Lim, who has published many books, take a look to see if we\ncan salvage this. If I could somehow just package what I've got, I could\nrelease it anyway. Greg told me what we had to do if I wanted to get this out,\nand I still couldn't do it.\n\nBut as I reflect on why I couldn't get the Azure book done, I realize that the\nbook somewhat disgusted me now\u2014the way your own old writing might sometimes\nmake you cringe when you read it back. I no longer believed many of the things\nI was recommending in that book. It was way too flowery about Azure.\n\nMy opinion changed. I simply don't think most people even need the complexity\nof Azure and many of its services anymore. And so, how can I write a book\nrecommending many of its complex services to others? I can't, and I won't.\n\nNo man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river, and\nhe's not the same man. \u2014Heraclitus\n\nBut recently, as I reflected on all this, I got a little sad.\n\nI got a little sad because, sure, I had missed out on some potential money I\ncould've made over the years. I'd missed out on having some customer emails\nand conversations with real people on this topic.\n\nBut I was mostly sad because I'd done some great work with Azure back in the\nday, and it was never captured or \"immortalized\" somewhere. Sure, the people\nwho worked with me back then knew, but those people are long gone in other\nroles & don't have the time to vouch for me in public that I know that stuff.\n\nThose people who know that I know my stuff don't have time to enter a Twitter\ndebate about whether Azure is worth using today and say, \"You can trust Louie;\nhe knows his stuff on this!\"\n\nBut a book that would've been out for a few years, maybe with some sales and\nsome reviews, would've gladly vouched for me, even if my opinion had changed.\nI got a little sad because I never got the public achievement, the\nrecognition, the credibility, or the accolades that I could've easily had if I\nhad just wrapped up that last damn 20%. And I like to remind myself of this\nstory now to make sure I timebox and get my stuff out so I never have any\nregrets.\n\nAnd so this is a cautionary tale for you too, as Naval famously said:\nInspiration is perishable.\n\nYou never know; it might be now or never for your idea, too.\n\nThanks for reading The M&Ms Newsletter!

Looking at that trend, it is probably a lot\nhigher now.\n\nI think this highlights the value of capturing attention, which does not seem\nto be going down in any way or anytime soon.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got some time, the young scholars at Rational VC (Iman & Cyrus) had\none of the best discussions on Nassim Taleb\u2019s ideas from Black Swan I\u2019ve ever\nheard.\n\nThey really geek out on this episode & explain these ideas in a way you may\nfind enjoyable on a long walk.\n\n###\n\nThree Laughs: \u201cDon\u2019t start a company. Start a religion\u201d, \u201cYes, But the Ads!\",\n\u201cEarthquakes shaking souls.\u201d\n\nSam Altman, once quote Qi Lu and said:\n\n> \"Successful people create companies. More successful people create\n> countries. The most successful people create religions.\"\n\nBased on the replies to his tweets, Sam might be getting his wish.\n\nThere are a few ways to see this: the first way I see it is that we might have\nad blockers, but they\u2019re still going to be advertised to us.\n\nThe second is that the best brands are simply advertising to us 24/7.\n\nThe recent earthquakes really have people rethinking their life choices about\nmarriage and so on.\n\nThank you for reading!\n\n\u2014Louie\n\nP.S.

I feel to this so much and have alot of regrets in this vein. I think\nit relates to creative efforts and expressions as well, they assume the role\nof a journal and reflection on a moment in time in your life's journey, but if\nnever completed, or worked on over years, they don't have the same impact. A\ngood lesson and goal to finish and look forward to new endeavors and creations\nfor your future self.Expand full commentLike (1)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n4 more comments...\n\nM&Ms: Empire Builders\n\nHow trying to build empires instead of building things people want ruins\nmanagers and teams.\n\nNov 21, 2022 \u2022\n\nLouie Bacaj\n\n22\n\nShare this post\n\n#### M&Ms: Empire Builders\n\nnewsletter.memesmotivations.com\n\n4\n\nM&Ms: Two Years In The Arena\n\nIt's my two year anniversary since I quit the big company job to become an\nentrepreneur.
