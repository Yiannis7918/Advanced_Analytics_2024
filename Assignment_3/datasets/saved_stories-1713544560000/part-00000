Burns invoked the agency\u2019s statutory privileges to avoid giving\na New York judge details of the spying operation that was revealed by EL PA\u00cdS\nin 2019\n\nJos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Irujo\n\nMadrid - Apr 19, 2024 - 11:47 GMT+2\n\nWilliam J. Burns, veteran American diplomat and director of the Central\nIntelligence Agency (CIA).\n\nCIA Director William J. Burns has invoked the National Security Act of 1947\nand the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949 to refuse to provide any\ninformation to a New York court judge investigating how a Spanish company\nspied on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange during his stay at the Ecuadorian\nembassy in London.\n\nIn an eight-page letter sent to Judge John G. Koeltl, Burns claims that the\ninformation could cause \u201cserious damage to the national security of the United\nStates.\u201d He further cites the CIA\u2019s statutory privileges \u201cto protect\nintelligence sources, methods and activities\u201d at issue in the case. The New\nYork judge ruled last December that the Spanish company UC Global S. L and the\nCIA violated the rights and privacy of the U.S. citizens who visited Assange\nduring his stay at the Ecuadorian embassy \u2014 rights protected by the fourth\namendment of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nFour U.S. citizens, two lawyers and two journalists sued Mike Pompeo, the\nformer director of the CIA, the intelligence agency, and David Morales, the\nowner of UC Global, which was tasked with security in the London embassy\nduring the Ecuadorian administration of Rafael Correa.\n\n## Confidential report for the judge\n\nThe statement from Burns, to which this newspaper has had access, is dated\nMarch 27, and is intended to anticipate the next stage of the case in which\nthe plaintiffs will request the declassification of the CIA operation in\ndiscovery. According to legal sources, Judge Koeltl could authorize this\nrequest. The details of this secret operation (audios, videos, emails and\ndocuments) were revealed by an EL PA\u00cdS investigation in 2019. Evidence from\nthis report was presented in the lawsuit filed by the spying victims in the\nNew York justice system.\n\nBurns, a renowned former diplomat and the architect of the 2015 Iran nuclear\ndeal, argues that \u201ceither admitting or denying that CIA has information\nimplicated by the remaining allegations in the Amended Complaint reasonably\ncould be expected to cause serious \u2014 and in some cases, exceptionally grave \u2014\ndamage to the national security of the United States.\u201d The head of the most\npowerful intelligence service in the United States reiterates that his legal\nprivileges include refusing to disclose the CIA\u2019s activity in this case and\nall information related to classified sources, methods and interests.\n\nIn addition to this statement, the head of the CIA has delivered to the judge\nan ex parte report, solely accessible to the magistrate, where he explains in\ndetail that only the judge can know why declassifying this espionage operation\nwould cause serious damage to the national security of the United States.\nBurns has no qualms about taking part in CIA activities on the ground: in\nAugust 2021, he met with the leader of the Taliban in Kabul during the U.S.\narmy\u2019s withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\nJudge John G. Koeltl recognized that the plaintiffs\u2019 rights were violated when\nUC Global S.L. workers seized their cell phones and photographed their\npasswords and content \u2014 practices that he considered illegal. But he ruled\nthat it was not illegal for microphone recordings to be made of their\nconversations with Assange at the Embassy or for photographs of their\npassports to be taken. For the Koeltl, these last actions of the workers of UC\nGlobal S.L. did not constitute a crime as the visitors had no \u201creasonable\nexpectation of privacy\u201d when they entered the embassy, as it is a public\nspace.\n\nFor the judge, the plaintiffs have presented sufficient evidence that Morales,\nthe Spanish ex-military officer who owns UC Global, acted as an agent or\ncollaborator and following instructions from the CIA and its then director\nPompeo, who was later appointed Secretary of State during the Donald Trump\nadministration (2017-2021).\n\nThe lawsuit over the spying of Assange\u2019s visitors was filed in August 2021 by\nlawyers Margaret Ratner Kunstler and Deborah Hrbek, and journalists John Goetz\nand Charles Glass, both national security specialists. The four visited the\nAustralian activist, as did hundreds of people who were also spied on.\nAccording to the lawsuit, a hundred American citizens, including Assange\u2019s\nlawyers and doctors, suffered the same fate.\n\nIn his ruling, the New York judge noted that Pompeo said Assange was a\n\u201ctarget\u201d of the CIA and that he would start a \u201clong-term campaign\u201d against\nWikiLeaks. The investigation of this newspaper revealed in 2019 that the\ncompany UC Global S.L. spied on the Australian\u2019s conversations with his\nlawyers and collaborators for the U.S., when the WikiLeaks founder was\npreparing his defense strategy against the U.S. extradition request for\nrevealing secret information about the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Weeks\nlater, the police arrested David Morales. The ex-military officer has been on\nbail since then and Spain\u2019s high court, the Audiencia Nacional, is\ninvestigating him for the alleged crimes of violating client-attorney\nconfidentiality, misappropriation of funds, bribery and money laundering.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage\nfrom EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition\n\n### More information\n\n### Julian Assange spying case: Judge suggests CIA may have received illicitly\nrecorded conversations\n\nJos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Irujo | Madrid\n\n### Spaniard at center of Julian Assange spying accusations claims ambassador\nordered espionage\n\nJos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Irujo | Madrid\n\n### Archived In\n\n  * Julian Assange\n  * Wikileaks\n  * CIA\n  * Ecuador\n\nAdheres to\n\nMore information\n\nIf you are interested in licensing this content, please contact\nventacontenidos@prisamedia.com\n\nSponsored Content\n\nForge Of Empires\n\nWenn du \u00fcber 45 Jahre alt bist, wirst du dieses Strategiespiel 2024\nliebenForge Of Empires|\n\nPatrocinadoPatrocinado\n\nCheckfox\n\nBis zu 50% weniger PKV-Beitrag zahlen: Geheimtipp, den jeder Privatversicherte\nkennen sollteCheckfox|\n\nPatrocinadoPatrocinado\n\nLebens Sicherheit\n\nAchtung: Wer Kinder hat, muss das vor seinem Tod erledigenLebens Sicherheit|\n\nPatrocinadoPatrocinado\n\nAnd Also...\n\n\u2018Run, run, run\u2019: Chaos at a Sydney mall as six people stabbed to death, and\nthe suspect fatally shotEl Pa\u00eds\n\nAS\n\nIs Riley Keough the sole heir of Graceland?
