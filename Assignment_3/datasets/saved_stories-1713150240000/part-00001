Both are siblings of the Kyocera KC-85 platform, comprising \u2014 in\nalphabetical order \u2014 Kyocera's own Kyotronic 85, the NEC PC-8201(A), the\nOlivetti M10, and, last but not least, the TRS-80 Model 100, with about 6\nmillion sold the most popular of all. (1984 saw the addition of two further\nmodels featuring more initial RAM and refined ROMs, the NEC PC-8300 and the\nTRS-80 Model 102.)\n\nThese computers came with a nice version of Microsoft BASIC v.1, a LCD display\nfeaturing 8 rows at 40 characters and a graphics resolution of 240 \u00d7 64\npixels, and a nice implementation of serial communications via RS-232C (the\nNEC PC-8201 adds two more SIO interfaces). So we should be able to network the\nmachines and have a decent game of Maze War running on them, preferably\nwritten as a single cross-platform program.\n\nWhile the two machines, the M10 and the PC-8201A, have much in common and\nshould run at about the same speed, there are also subtle differences. Namely,\nas of concern for this project, there are differences in the COM-settings, in\nthe communication commands, in the mechanism of machine language/ROM calls\n(CALL vs. EXEC), and, most importantly, in the graphics support. So we'll have\nto explore some tricks and work-arounds to get the same approach working for\nboth machines. Support for the Model 100 will be intended, but not tested (I\ndon't have one), the Kyotronic 85 will have to stand aside for lack of\ndocumentation (at least in Western/Roman script). (Update: Eventually, the\nKyotronic 85 became supported, too, as well as the TRS-80 Model 102 and,\nprobably, the NEC PC-8300.)\n\n#### Ingredients\n\nThe setup: Olivetti M10 and NEC PC-8201A, cables, MBA\n\nFor this project, we'll use\n\n  * an Olivetti M10 portable computer (1983), European model (German keyboard), RAM expanded to 32K,\n  * a NEC PC-8201A portable computer (1983), RAM expanded to 32K,\n  * a MacBook Air (MBA) running CoolTerm as a means of supplying the same software to both of the machines,\n  * a RS-232C DB-25 (m) to DB-25 (m) null modem cable to connect the Olivetti M10 and the NEC PC-8201A,\n  * a RS-232C DB-25 (m) to DB-9 (f) null modem cable and a serial-to-USB interface (Tera Grand USB2-VE487-TG, FTDI chipset, very stable and drivers are preinstalled in Mac OS X 10.9+) to connect each of the machines to the MBA,\n  * a text editor of choice for the MBA, we'll use the proven swiss army knife of Mac software, BBEdit, (also used for writing this blog, which might qualify for a retro-challenge as well)\n  * some documentation related to the vintage machines (manuals, technical references, ROM-listings, vintage BBS posts, etc).\n\n## The Episodes\n\nIncluding information on the hardware and software of the machines involved,\nteardown images, the thrills of BASIC-listings and our nifty plans to get\nthere, colorful rants on emulators, German keyboards, and growing upload\ntimes, the tale of a small battery wonder, and even more. Eventually, we\narrive at a program that is both low-level and does decently (while not\nrapidly) perform some pseudo-3D rendering in BASIC only, on 5 (or even six)\ndifferent machines at once (Olivetti M10, NEC PC-8201A, Kyotronic 85, TRS-80\nModel 100 and Model 102, and probably the NEC PC-8300, too \u2014 32K of RAM\nrecommended). Not the full game as intended, but some. (Summary added after\nthe fact.)\n\n  * Episode #1: The Kyocera Siblings\n\nWhere we learn some about the background, similarities and differences of the\nmachines involved, which may have some impact on our project. (Caution:\nContains lots of images.)\n\n\u25b6 Read it ...\n\n  * Episode #2: Soft Considerations\n\nWhere we consider the Grand Design in the light of the variablity of software,\nits quirks, and general implementations.\n\n\u25b6 Read it ...\n\n  * Episode #3: Drafting Time\n\nWhere we retreat to the (virtual) drawing table considering the finer details.\nFinally, we arrive at a viable mockup.\n\n\u25b6 Read it ...\n\n  * Episode #4: LCD Talk\n\nWhere we learn some about the internals of the LCD and its communication\noptions. At last, we run a program for real and put something on the screen.\n\n\u25b6 Read it ...\n\n  * Episode #5: From Mockup to Data\n\nNot much time today for the project, so we explore ways of being lazy.\nHowever, we get some essential DATA ready. Also, The tale of a small miracle.\n\n\u25b6 Read it ...\n\n  * Episode #6: The Round and the Square \u2014 Displaying the Maze Map\n\nWhere we bring the maze map onto the LCD display (naturally using our low-\nlevel approach), thus rectifying our previous omission. A sliding window is\nour friend where number theory is at odds. \u25b6 Read it ...\n\n  * Episode #7: Roaming the Maze\n\nWe promised to add roaming soon, et voil\u00e0, already a playable maze game. Not\ntoo bad for a midterm result, but still lots to do.\n\n\u25b6 Read it ...\n\n  * Episode #8: Creative Pico Murder \u2014 A Virtual Marketing Campaign\n\nIt's midterm in development and with just two more weeks to go the marketing\ndepartment is going busy. \u25b6 Read it ...\n\n  * Episode #9: Quest for Speed\n\nWhere we consider timing issues and options based on the ground we've already\nmade. (Caution: Includes machine language.)\n\n\u25b6 Read it ...\n\n  * Episode #10: Cross-Platform ROM Diving\n\nThanks to Virtual T we have a fresh view on cross-compatibility and add two\nmore models to our compatibility list. Also, we provide a comprehensive\nfeatures and properties list for most of the \"Kyocera Siblings\" to persue our\ngoal.\n\n\u25b6 Read it ...\n\n  * Episode #11: A Path to the Maze\n\nWhere we get hands-on again and render a symbolic *Ersatz* viewport. However,\nwe're already looking into the maze. Provided, it's still not 3D, but \"pseudo\"\nmay already apply...\n\n\u25b6 Read it ...\n\n  * Episode #12: A Screen With a View\n\nWhere we continue our quest for a 3D-viewport. As this is also the end of the\nmonth, it's our final episode, too. Short of time in more than one sense, JIT-\nbyte-code saves us some. Eventually, we finish with a viable dungeon crawler\n...\n\n\u25b6 Read it ...\n\n  * Addendum: A Final Fix\n\nWe were that busy with the writeup of the final episode that we didn't have a\nchance to fix a last, tiny bug before the midnight deadline. So, while\nRetrochallenge is definitely over, we return to the code to hunt down the\nlittle critter, as a question of honour ... Also, the official release of the\ncode. \u25b6 Read it ...\n\n\u2014 Thanks for dropping by and cheers to all others who particpiated in\nRetrochallenge 2016/01! \u2014\n\n+++ Breaking news: Our humble project was actually picked as one of the\nwinners! :-) +++\n\n\u2014 finis \u2014\n\nNorbert Landsteiner Janury 2016, Vienna, Austria www.masswerk.at \u2013 contact me.\n\n\u2014 This series is part of Retrochallenge 2016/01. \u2014\n\n", "frontpage": false}
