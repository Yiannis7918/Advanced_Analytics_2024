You can help by adding missing items\nwith reliable sources.\n\nThis is a list of notable custom software projects which have significantly\nfailed to achieve some or all of their objectives, either temporarily or\npermanently, and/or have suffered from significant cost overruns. For a list\nof successful major custom software projects, see Custom software^[1] #Major\nproject successes.\n\nNote that failed projects, and projects running over budget, are not\nnecessarily the sole fault of the employees or businesses creating the\nsoftware. In some cases, problems may be due partly to problems with the\npurchasing organisation, including poor requirements, over-ambitious\nrequirements, unnecessary requirements, poor contract drafting, poor contract\nmanagement, poor end-user training, or poor operational management.\n\n## Permanent failures[edit]\n\nBecause software, unlike a major civil engineering construction project, is\noften easy and cheap to change after it has been constructed, a piece of\ncustom software that fails to deliver on its objectives may sometimes be\nmodified over time in such a way that it later succeeds\u2014and/or business\nprocesses or end-user mindsets may change to accommodate the software.\nHowever, sometimes, for various reasons, neither approach succeeds (or is even\ntried), and this may be considered as another level of failure\u2014a permanent\nfailure.\n\nStarted| Terminated| System name| Type of system| Country or region| Type of\npurchaser| Problems| Cost (expected)| Outsourced or in-house?| Outcome  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n1980s| 1993| TAURUS| Electronic trading platform| United Kingdom (London)|\nStock exchange| Scope creep, cost overrun.

In the next audit in 2016, the Auditor\nGeneral of Ontario noted that 14 years after Smart Systems for Health was\nstarted, not all of the eHealth projects were complete, and it was impossible\nto even determine if they were overbudget because the government had never\noriginally put a budget on them.^[14]| Can$8bn (unknown)| In-house, but with\nheavy use of consultants  \n2013| HealthCare.gov| Healthcare exchange website^[15]| United States| Federal\ngovernment| By some estimates, only 1% of people managed to successfully\nenroll with the site in its first week of operation.^[15] On October 20, 2013,\nPresident Barack Obama remarked, \"There's no sugar coating: the website has\nbeen too slow, people have been getting stuck during the application process\nand I think it's fair to say that nobody's more frustrated by that than I\nam.\"| $1.5bn ($93.7m)| Outsourced  \n2013| Queensland Health Payroll System| Payroll system| Australia| State\ngovernment| The Queensland Health Payroll System was launched in 2010 in what\ncould be considered one of the most spectacularly over budget projects in\nAustralian history, coming in at over 200 times the original budget.

The air force\nwas operating at a 70% capacity, another area was reported to operate at a 3%\ncapacity with half of the staff not able to work at all. It would take up to a\nyear to restore capacity.^[20]^[21] At this point the cost to scrap the\nproject and develop a new one was estimated to be SEK 11bn ($1.3bn). Not seen\nas an alternative, the development continued and the original budget of SEK\n2.4bn was increased to 4bn.^[22] In 2015 the project was still on its way to\nbe fully implemented.| SEK 4bn ($470m)^[23] (ongoing)| Technical aspects\noutsourced  \n2013| Universal Credit| Welfare payments system consolidation| United Kingdom|\nCentral government| The schedule has slipped, with the final delivery date now\nexpected to be 2021, although the system is gradually being introduced.

Program has also suffered from significant scope creep^[28] and\nconfused objectives.^[29] It is likely that choice of XBRL as the reporting\nformat is the main driver behind low take-up (due to its obscurity and high\nimplementation cost ^[30]^[31]^[32] relative to other technical standards).|\n~$1bn to date (ongoing)| Technical aspects outsourced  \n  \n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Software crisis\n  * Vaporware\n  * Agile software development\n  * Government waste\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"Syed Faisal Kazmi | Expert Full Stack Web Developer\". faisalkazmi.com.
