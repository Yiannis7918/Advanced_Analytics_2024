They can solve all three, simply by doing\nnothing. Chinese citizens overwhelmingly oppose a mandatory increase in the\nretirement age; however, Chinese citizens also overwhelmingly accept that they\nwill probably have to work through retirement, because of a lack of retirement\nsavings and low government pensions. Chinese government officials announced in\n2020 and in 2021 that the retirement age in China would be raised, and were\nimmediately met with huge public outcry in opposition. Since, there have been\nno new policies formulated, nor announcements. But neither have they moved to\nincrease pension benefits for retirees. They seem content to let individuals\ndecide for themselves whether they can afford to quit working, or not.\nResources and links: Measures of consumer spending by age group: / average-\nretirement-expenses-are-you-spendi... https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-4...\nhttps://www.sunmark.org/connect/sunma...
