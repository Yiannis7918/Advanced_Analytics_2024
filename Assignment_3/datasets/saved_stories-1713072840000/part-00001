A co-\nemergence involving adjacent broods of different life cycles is something that\nhappens only roughly every 25 years. Any two specific broods of different life\ncycles co-emerge only every 221 years.\n\n### 2024 is a special year for periodical cicadas:\n\n  * For the first time since 2015 a 13-year brood will emerge in the same year as a 17-year brood.\n  * For the first time since 1998 adjacent 13-and 17-year broods will emerge in the same year.\n  * For the first time since 1803 Brood XIX and XIII will co-emerge.\n  * You will be able to see all seven named periodical cicada species as adults in the same year, which will not happen again until 2037. You will not see all seven named species emerge in the state of Illinois again until 2041.\n\nFor more information, see the table of upcoming co-emergences at the bottom of\nthis page.\n\n### What will happen in 2024...\n\nBroods XIII and XIX will emerge in their respective ranges. Because 2024 is\none year in advance of the Brood XIV emergence in 2025 and four years in\nadvance of the Brood XXIII emergence in 2027, off-cycle cicadas will also\nemerge in the ranges of these broods. See our straggler cicada page for more\ninformation about off-cycle cicadas.\n\n### What will not happen in 2024...\n\nFigure 5 from Stannard (1975). Note that the brood boundaries as shown in this\nfigure are no longer considered accurate and that the differences between this\nfigure and actual distributions are discussed on the pages for the individual\nbroods. .\n\n13-year Brood XIX and 17-year Brood XIII do not overlap to any significant\nextent. They may co-occur in patches of woods, but these patches will be small\nin size.\n\nStannard (1975) published a map of all Illinois periodical cicada broods\n(reproduced at left). We discuss Stannard\u2019s delimitation of individual broods\non the relevant pages of this site; note, however, that no significant overlap\nis shown between Broods XIII and XIX.\n\nBecause the broods do not overlap to any significant extent, the 2024 co-\nemergence of Brood XIII and XIX will not involve areas of extreme or \u201cdouble\u201d\ndensities outside the norm of what happens in any other periodical cicada\nemergence year.\n\nThe greatest likelihood of contact between these broods is around Springfield\nIL; however, note that our map (below) shows Brood XIII in the northwest\nquadrant of the city and Brood XIX in the southeast quadrant; while there may\nbe scattered woods in which both broods are present, there will be no broad\noverlap\u2013 and it will be impossible, in 2024, to identify any areas of overlap,\nlarge or small, because the cicada species present in each brood in any area\nof potential overlap will be distinguishable primarily on the basis of life\ncycle.\n\nWhat would happen if 13- and 17- year cicadas did interbreed? See discussion\nbelow.\n\nIn the map below, positive (presence) records of Brood XIII are represented by\nupwards facing cicadas, and negative (absence) records of the brood are\nrepresented by blue crosses. Positive (presence) records of Brood XIX are\nrepresented by downwards facing cicadas, and negative (absence) records of the\nbrood are represented by red crosses. Zoom into Illinois to explore the\nboundary between Brood XIII and XIX and hover over records to see details.\nOnly these two broods are shown; all others have been removed for clarity.\nNote that the dates on this map do not represent dates of adult emergence;\nrather, they represent dates on which choruses were active. Thus, in any given\narea, adult emergence may have occurred a week or more earlier than the dates\nshown on this map. This map may not be reproduced without written permission.\nSee this note about the characteristics and limitations of the maps on this\nsite.\n\nWhat can you expect to see during this rare co-emergence?\n\n> ^As a thought experiment, imagine a drive down I-57, starting in Chicago in\n> June 2024. We start our journey southward on the Dan Ryan Expressway. Right\n> in the city, we might encounter patches of cicadas when older tree canopies\n> are present, but it\u2019s so urban that we\u2019re unlikely to hit large populations\n> of periodical cicadas until we get to the Calumet River; even then, they\u2019ll\n> still be sparse and patchy until we get to the intersection of I-57 and\n> I-80. Continuing on, periodical cicadas won\u2019t be reliably present until we\n> get south of Monee (roughly where Dybas\u2019 Raccoon Grove census spot is-the\n> source of the \u201cseveral million per acre\u201d figure often quoted in the press).\n> But the cicadas will still be patchy because the woods are patchy. Once we\n> get close to Kankakee, the cicadas will be dense in the relatively thick\n> riparian woodlands.

About where you cross US 50, you\u2019ll pick up the species M.\n> tredecim, and the M. neotredecim will exhibit displaced song pitches. ^As\n> you continue south, you\u2019ll be in XIX right down to Lake of Egypt, where\n> you\u2019ll cross into Brood XXIII, which has been close to the interstate ever\n> since you passed Rend Lake. If you head south on I-24 instead of I-57,\n> you\u2019ll stay in Brood XIX almost to the Ohio River. Nowhere along the way\n> will you encounter double- densities or anything at all to tip you off that\n> you are in a co-emergence year or that you just witnessed something unsual.\n> Plenty of times along the way, you\u2019ll encounter gaps or treeless areas\n> without cicadas... But nothing obvious will indicate to you that that one\n> gap south of Kankakee was special, because that\u2019s where the broods swapped\n> over.\n\n\u201cSubtle\u201d is not a word usually associated with periodical cicadas\u2013 but the\nspecialness of the 2024 co-emergence will be subtle.\n\n### How many cicadas will there be?\n\nAlthough there are a lot of periodical cicadas, they are not generally\nconsidered to be insect pests and there is no reason to use pesticides on\nthem. Instead, see our FAQ for other means of management.\n\nIt turns out that it is extremely hard to estimate the population sizes of\nperiodical cicadas, for any number of reasons. The oft-quoted figure of\ndensities that can exceed a million per acre comes from a census taken during\nthe 1956 emergence of Brood XIII in Raccoon Grove, IL (Dybas and Davis 1962).\nIronically, Brood XIII appears to have gone extinct or nearly extinct in\nRaccoon Grove in the years since 1956 (Cooley et al. 2016; Karban 2014), so it\nis clear that periodical cicadas are variable across space and time!\n\nIf we accept a rough estimate of one million cicadas per acre... should that\nbe surprising? How many ants are there per acre? How many mayflies? How many\nfruit flies? Insects often come in large numbers. What\u2019s special about\nMagicicada is not the large numbers per se, but the periodicity\u2013 the\npredictable, synchronous emergence of large numbers of adults and their near-\ntotal absence in the years between (see the \u201cstraggler\u201d page for more\ninformation).\n\nThe state of Delaware is roughly 1.5 million acres in size. If we accept an\nestimate of a million cicadas per acre and if the total combined area of a\nperiodical cicada emergence is roughly the size of Delaware, then more than a\ntrillion cicadas will be involved. For 2024, since cicadas will emerge from\nMaryland to Oklahoma, Illinois to Alabama, clearly, trillions of adult cicadas\nwill be present\u2013 but not all in the same place at the same time.\n\n### Will the cicadas be affected by climate change?\n\nYes... but they always have been. It\u2019s complicated...\n\n### What would happen if 13- and 17-year cicadas interbred*?\n\nLloyd, Kritsky, and Simon (1983) proposed a single locus Mendelian model to\nexplain periodical cicada life cycles, with an allele for 17 year cycles\ndominant to an allele for 13-year cycles**. Sota (2022) proposed a more\ncomplex polygenic model in which life cycle length is governed by variations\nin growth rates and the action of developmental \u201cgates\u201d that allow individuals\nto move on to the next developmental stage only if they meet or exceed certain\nsize criteria. Regardless of which model better represents Magicicada life\ncycle architecture, both predict that the offspring of hybridization events\nbetween co-emerging 13- and 17- year broods will have life cycles of 13 or 17\nyears rather than cycles of intermediate length. Thus, following a co-\nemergence, if hybrid offspring were produced, then they would emerge alongside\nthe next generation of one or both of their parental broods and be\nindistinguishable from cicadas that were not hybrids. What would happen in\ngenerations after that? Stay tuned for forthcoming publications...\n\n_*Hybrid offspring have been produced experimentally between species belonging\nto different species groups (White 1973; Fontaine et al. 2007) and between\nspecies differing in life cycle (Cooley et al. 2006).\n\n_**But see Marshall (2001).\n\n### Why won\u2019t there be areas of \u201cdouble densities\u201d during the 2024 co-\nemergence?\n\nFirst, as noted, Brood XIII and XIX do not overlap to any significant extent.\nSecond, there is no special reason to expect that any woods in which the\nbroods did overlap could support more cicadas than any other woods.\nCompetition for resources (e.g., food, space, or ovipisition sites) is\nexpected to impose an upper limit on cicada densities.\n\nAs with most things related to periodcial cicadas, the story is s a little\nmore complicated. Simon et al. (1981) studied Broods I and XIV on Long Island,\nwhich have the same life cycle (17) and are always separated by a temporal gap\nof no less than four years (Brood XIV emerges, and then Brood I emerges four\nyears later, and the pattern repeats 13 years later). Simon et al. (1981)\nfound that these broods overlapped slightly and that woods with both broods\nsupported greater densities of cicadas than woods with only Brood XIV. There\nis a reasonable argument to be made that greater densities are possible in\nthis circumstance, since these broods are consistently separated by temporal\ngaps of four (or more) years; this temporal gap ensures that whatever\naboveground resources adults of each brood might compete for can replenish and\nthat the nymphs of each brood are at different enough states of development\nthat competition for resources belowground is reduced.\n\nBut a 13 and 17 year brood do not have a consistent temporal separation; in\nsome years (such as 2024), the broods co-emerge, suggesting maximal\ncompetition, while in other parts of the 221-year cycle, the two broods are as\nseparated in time as possible, suggeting minimal competition. Thus, there is\nno reason to expect that the increased densities noted by Simon et al. (1981)\nfor overlapping broods of the same cycle would also be expected where broods\nof different cycles overlap.\n\n### Table of upcoming co-emergences (highlighted rows show adjacent broods):\n\n13-year brood| 17-year brood| Year  \n---|---|---  \nXIX| XIII| 2024  \nXIX| IX| 2037  \nXXIII| XIII| 2041  \nXIX| V| 2050  \nXXII| VIII| 2053  \nXXIII| IX| 2054  \nXIX| I| 2063  \nXXII| IV| 2066  \nXXIII| V| 2067  \nXIX| XIV| 2076  \n  \n## To learn more about periodical cicadas, explore our website!\n\n## Literature\n\n  * \u00a9 University of Connecticut\n  * Disclaimers, Privacy & Copyright\n  * Accessibility\n  * Webmaster Login\n\nPrevious Slide\n\nNext Slide\n\n", "frontpage": false}
