J. reset his smooth watch in\nhis interior pocket as he came down the presbytery steps. Five to three. Just\nnice time to walk to Artane. What was that boy\u2019s name again? Dignam. Yes. Vere\ndignum et iustum est. Brother Swan was the person to see. Mr Cunningham\u2019s\nletter. Yes. Oblige him, if possible. Good practical catholic: useful at\nmission time.\n\nA onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his crutches,\ngrowled some notes. He jerked short before the convent of the sisters of\ncharity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very reverend John\nConmee S. J. Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his purse held, he knew,\none silver crown.\n\nFather Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square. He thought, but not for long, of\nsoldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs, ending\ntheir days in some pauper ward, and of cardinal Wolsey\u2019s words: If I had\nserved my God as I have served my king He would not have abandoned me in my\nold days. He walked by the treeshade of sunnywinking leaves: and towards him\ncame the wife of Mr David Sheehy M. P.\n\n\u2014Very well, indeed, father. And you, father?\n\nFather Conmee was wonderfully well indeed. He would go to Buxton probably for\nthe waters. And her boys, were they getting on well at Belvedere? Was that so?\nFather Conmee was very glad indeed to hear that. And Mr Sheehy himself? Still\nin London. The house was still sitting, to be sure it was. Beautiful weather\nit was, delightful indeed. Yes, it was very probable that Father Bernard\nVaughan would come again to preach. O, yes: a very great success. A wonderful\nman really.\n\nFather Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy M. P. looking\nso well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy M. P. Yes, he would\ncertainly call.\n\n\u2014Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy.\n\nFather Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the jet\nbeads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun. And smiled yet again, in going.\nHe had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste.\n\nFather Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father Bernard\nVaughan\u2019s droll eyes and cockney voice.\n\n\u2014Pilate! Wy don\u2019t you old back that owlin mob?\n\nA zealous man, however. Really he was. And really did great good in his way.\nBeyond a doubt. He loved Ireland, he said, and he loved the Irish. Of good\nfamily too would one think it? Welsh, were they not?\n\nO, lest he forget. That letter to father provincial.\n\nFather Conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of Mountjoy\nsquare. Yes: they were from Belvedere. The little house. Aha. And were they\ngood boys at school? O. That was very good now. And what was his name? Jack\nSohan. And his name? Ger. Gallaher. And the other little man? His name was\nBrunny Lynam. O, that was a very nice name to have.\n\nFather Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam and pointed\nto the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street.\n\n\u2014But mind you don\u2019t post yourself into the box, little man, he said.\n\nThe boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed:\n\n\u2014O, sir.\n\n\u2014Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said.\n\nMaster Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee\u2019s letter to\nfather provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox. Father Conmee\nsmiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square east.\n\nMr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, in silk hat, slate frockcoat with\nsilk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender trousers, canary gloves and\npointed patent boots, walking with grave deportment most respectfully took the\ncurbstone as he passed lady Maxwell at the corner of Dignam\u2019s court.\n\nWas that not Mrs M\u2018Guinness?\n\nMrs M\u2018Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the farther\nfootpath along which she sailed. And Father Conmee smiled and saluted. How did\nshe do?\n\nA fine carriage she had. Like Mary, queen of Scots, something. And to think\nthat she was a pawnbroker! Well, now! Such a ... what should he say? .... such\na queenly mien.\n\nFather Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the shutup free\nchurch on his left. The reverend T. R. Greene B. A. will (D. V.) speak. The\nincumbent they called him. He felt it incumbent on him to say a few words. But\none should be charitable. Invincible ignorance. They acted according to their\nlights.\n\nFather Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular road. It\nwas a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important thoroughfare.\nSurely, there ought to be.\n\nA band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street. All raised\nuntidy caps. Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly. Christian\nbrother boys.\n\nFather Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked. Saint Joseph\u2019s\nchurch, Portland row. For aged and virtuous females. Father Conmee raised his\nhat to the Blessed Sacrament. Virtuous: but occasionally they were also\nbadtempered.\n\nNear Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman. And\nnow it was an office or something.\n\nFather Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted by Mr\nWilliam Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop. Father Conmee saluted\nMr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches and\nample cools of butter. He passed Grogan\u2019s the Tobacconist against which\nnewsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in New York. In America\nthose things were continually happening. Unfortunate people to die like that,\nunprepared. Still, an act of perfect contrition.\n\nFather Conmee went by Daniel Bergin\u2019s publichouse against the window of which\ntwo unlabouring men lounged. They saluted him and were saluted.\n\nFather Conmee passed H. J. O\u2019Neill\u2019s funeral establishment where Corny\nKelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay. A\nconstable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted the\nconstable. In Youkstetter\u2019s, the porkbutcher\u2019s, Father Conmee observed pig\u2019s\npuddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in tubes.\n\nMoored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a turfbarge, a\ntowhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated\namidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him. It was\nidyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of the Creator who had\nmade turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to town and\nhamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people.\n\nOn Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S. J. of saint Francis\nXavier\u2019s church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outward bound tram.\n\nOff an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C. C. of saint\nAgatha\u2019s church, north William street, on to Newcomen bridge.\n\nAt Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he\ndisliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island.\n\nFather Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with care\nin the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a sixpence and five\npennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse. Passing the ivy\nchurch he reflected that the ticket inspector usually made his visit when one\nhad carelessly thrown away the ticket. The solemnity of the occupants of the\ncar seemed to Father Conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap. Father\nConmee liked cheerful decorum.\n\nIt was a peaceful day. The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father Conmee\nhad finished explaining and looked down. His wife, Father Conmee supposed.\n\nA tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the glasses.\nShe raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so gently, tiptapping her small\ngloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily, sweetly.\n\nFather Conmee perceived her perfume in the car. He perceived also that the\nawkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the seat.\n\nFather Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth\nof the awkward old man who had the shaky head.\n\nAt Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old woman\nrose suddenly from her place to alight. The conductor pulled the bellstrap to\nstay the car for her. She passed out with her basket and a marketnet: and\nFather Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down: and Father\nConmee thought that, as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare, she\nwas one of those good souls who had always to be told twice bless you, my\nchild, that they have been absolved, pray for me. But they had so many worries\nin life, so many cares, poor creatures.\n\nFrom the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at Father\nConmee.\n\nFather Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of\nhis sermon on saint Peter Claver S. J. and the African mission and of the\npropagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow\nsouls that had not received the baptism of water when their last hour came\nlike a thief in the night. That book by the Belgian jesuit, Le Nombre des\n\u00c9lus, seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea. Those were millions of human\nsouls created by God in His Own likeness to whom the faith had not (D. V.)\nbeen brought. But they were God\u2019s souls, created by God. It seemed to Father\nConmee a pity that they should all be lost, a waste, if one might say.\n\nAt the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the conductor\nand saluted in his turn.\n\nThe Malahide road was quiet. It pleased Father Conmee, road and name. The\njoybells were ringing in gay Malahide. Lord Talbot de Malahide, immediate\nhereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining. Then came the call\nto arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day. Those were old worldish\ndays, loyal times in joyous townlands, old times in the barony.\n\nFather Conmee, walking, thought of his little book Old Times in the Barony and\nof the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of Mary Rochfort,\ndaughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of Belvedere.\n\nA listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough Ennel, Mary,\nfirst countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening, not startled\nwhen an otter plunged. Who could know the truth? Not the jealous lord\nBelvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed adultery fully,\neiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris, with her husband\u2019s brother?\nShe would half confess if she had not all sinned as women did. Only God knew\nand she and he, her husband\u2019s brother.\n\nFather Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however for man\u2019s\nrace on earth, and of the ways of God which were not our ways.\n\nDon John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore. He was humane and honoured\nthere. He bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at smiling noble faces\nin a beeswaxed drawingroom, ceiled with full fruit clusters. And the hands of\na bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble, were impalmed by Don John Conmee.\n\nIt was a charming day.\n\nThe lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages, curtseying\nto him with ample underleaves. The sky showed him a flock of small white\nclouds going slowly down the wind. Moutonner, the French said. A just and\nhomely word.\n\nFather Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds over\nRathcoffey. His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of Clongowes\nfield. He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard the cries of the\nboys\u2019 lines at their play, young cries in the quiet evening. He was their\nrector: his reign was mild.\n\nFather Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out. An ivory\nbookmark told him the page.\n\nNones. He should have read that before lunch. But lady Maxwell had come.\n\nFather Conmee read in secret Pater and Ave and crossed his breast. Deus in\nadiutorium.\n\nHe walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till he came\nto Res in Beati immaculati:\n\n\u2014Principium verborum tuorum veritas: in eternum omnia iudicia iustitiae tuae.\n\nA flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a young\nwoman with wild nodding daisies in her hand. The young man raised his cap\nabruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care detached from her\nlight skirt a clinging twig.\n\nFather Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his breviary.\nSin:\n\n\u2014Principes persecuti sunt me gratis: et a verbis tuis formidavit cor meum.\n\nCorny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye at a\npine coffinlid sentried in a corner. He pulled himself erect, went to it and,\nspinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass furnishings. Chewing his\nblade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came to the doorway. There he tilted\nhis hatbrim to give shade to his eyes and leaned against the doorcase, looking\nidly out.\n\nFather John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram on Newcomen bridge.\n\nCorny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat downtilted,\nchewing his blade of hay.\n\nConstable 57C, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day.\n\n\u2014That\u2019s a fine day, Mr Kelleher.\n\n\u2014Ay, Corny Kelleher said.\n\n\u2014It\u2019s very close, the constable said.\n\nCorny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth while a\ngenerous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a coin.\n\n\u2014What\u2019s the best news? he asked.\n\n\u2014I seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with bated\nbreath.\n\nA onelegged sailor crutched himself round MacConnell\u2019s corner, skirting\nRabaiotti\u2019s icecream car, and jerked himself up Eccles street. Towards Larry\nO\u2019Rourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growled unamiably:\n\n\u2014For England....\n\nHe swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus, halted and\ngrowled:\n\n\u2014home and beauty.\n\nJ. J. O\u2019Molloy\u2019s white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert was in the\nwarehouse with a visitor.\n\nA stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it into\nthe cap held out to her. The sailor grumbled thanks, glanced sourly at the\nunheeding windows, sank his head and swung himself forward four strides.\n\nHe halted and growled angrily:\n\n\u2014For England .....\n\nTwo barefoot urchins, sucking long liquorice laces, halted near him, gaping at\nhis stump with their yellowslobbered mouths.\n\nHe swung himself forward in vigorous jerks, halted, lifted his head towards a\nwindow and bayed deeply:\n\n\u2014home and beauty.\n\nThe gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased. The\nblind of the window was drawn aside. A card Unfurnished Apartments slipped\nfrom the sash and fell. A plump bare generous arm shone, was seen, held forth\nfrom a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps. A woman\u2019s hand flung forth\na coin over the area railings. It fell on the path.\n\nOne of the urchins ran to it, picked it up and dropped it into the minstrel\u2019s\ncap, saying:\n\n\u2014There, sir.\n\nKatey and Boody Dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming kitchen.\n\n\u2014Did you put in the books? Boody asked.\n\nMaggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds twice with\nher potstick and wiped her brow.\n\n\u2014They wouldn\u2019t give anything on them, she said.\n\nFather Conmee walked through Clongowes fields, his thinsocked ankles tickled\nby stubble.\n\n\u2014Where did you try? Boody asked.\n\n\u2014M\u2018Guinness\u2019s.\n\nBoody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table.\n\n\u2014Bad cess to her big face! she cried.\n\nKatey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes.\n\n\u2014What\u2019s in the pot? she asked.\n\n\u2014Shirts, Maggy said.\n\nBoody cried angrily:\n\n\u2014Crickey, is there nothing for us to eat?\n\nKatey, lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt, asked:\n\n\u2014And what\u2019s in this?\n\nA heavy fume gushed in answer.\n\n\u2014Peasoup, Maggy said.\n\n\u2014Where did you get it? Katey asked.\n\n\u2014Sister Mary Patrick, Maggy said.\n\nThe lacquey rang his bell.\n\n\u2014Barang!\n\nBoody sat down at the table and said hungrily:\n\n\u2014Give us it here.\n\nMaggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl. Katey, sitting\nopposite Boody, said quietly, as her fingertip lifted to her mouth random\ncrumbs:\n\n\u2014A good job we have that much. Where\u2019s Dilly?\n\n\u2014Gone to meet father, Maggy said.\n\nBoody, breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup, added:\n\n\u2014Our father who art not in heaven.\n\nMaggy, pouring yellow soup in Katey\u2019s bowl, exclaimed:\n\n\u2014Boody! For shame!\n\nA skiff, a crumpled throwaway, Elijah is coming, rode lightly down the Liffey,\nunder Loopline bridge, shooting the rapids where water chafed around the\nbridgepiers, sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains, between the\nCustomhouse old dock and George\u2019s quay.\n\nThe blond girl in Thornton\u2019s bedded the wicker basket with rustling fibre.\nBlazes Boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper and a small\njar.\n\n\u2014Put these in first, will you? he said.\n\n\u2014Yes, sir, the blond girl said. And the fruit on top.\n\n\u2014That\u2019ll do, game ball, Blazes Boylan said.\n\nShe bestowed fat pears neatly, head by tail, and among them ripe shamefaced\npeaches.\n\nBlazes Boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about the fruitsmelling\nshop, lifting fruits, young juicy crinkled and plump red tomatoes, sniffing\nsmells.\n\nH. E. L. Y\u2019S. filed before him, tallwhitehatted, past Tangier lane, plodding\ntowards their goal.\n\nHe turned suddenly from a chip of strawberries, drew a gold watch from his fob\nand held it at its chain\u2019s length.\n\n\u2014Can you send them by tram? Now?\n\nA darkbacked figure under Merchants\u2019 arch scanned books on the hawker\u2019s cart.\n\n\u2014Certainly, sir. Is it in the city?\n\n\u2014O, yes, Blazes Boylan said. Ten minutes.\n\nThe blond girl handed him a docket and pencil.\n\n\u2014Will you write the address, sir?\n\nBlazes Boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her.\n\n\u2014Send it at once, will you? he said. It\u2019s for an invalid.\n\n\u2014Yes, sir. I will, sir.\n\nBlazes Boylan rattled merry money in his trousers\u2019 pocket.\n\n\u2014What\u2019s the damage? he asked.\n\nThe blond girl\u2019s slim fingers reckoned the fruits.\n\nBlazes Boylan looked into the cut of her blouse. A young pullet. He took a red\ncarnation from the tall stemglass.\n\n\u2014This for me? he asked gallantly.\n\nThe blond girl glanced sideways at him, got up regardless, with his tie a bit\ncrooked, blushing.\n\n\u2014Yes, sir, she said.\n\nBending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches.\n\nBlazes Boylan looked in her blouse with more favour, the stalk of the red\nflower between his smiling teeth.\n\n\u2014May I say a word to your telephone, missy? he asked roguishly.\n\n\u2014Ma! Almidano Artifoni said.\n\nHe gazed over Stephen\u2019s shoulder at Goldsmith\u2019s knobby poll.\n\nTwo carfuls of tourists passed slowly, their women sitting fore, gripping the\nhandrests. Palefaces. Men\u2019s arms frankly round their stunted forms. They\nlooked from Trinity to the blind columned porch of the bank of Ireland where\npigeons roocoocooed.\n\n\u2014Anch\u2019io ho avuto di queste idee, Almidano Artifoni said, quand\u2019 ero giovine\ncome Lei. Eppoi mi sono convinto che il mondo \u00e8 una bestia. \u00c8 peccato. Perch\u00e8\nla sua voce .... sarebbe un cespite di rendita, via. Invece, Lei si sacrifica.\n\n\u2014Sacrifizio incruento, Stephen said smiling, swaying his ashplant in slow\nswingswong from its midpoint, lightly.\n\n\u2014Speriamo, the round mustachioed face said pleasantly. Ma, dia: retta a me. Ci\nrifletta.\n\nBy the stern stone hand of Grattan, bidding halt, an Inchicore tram unloaded\nstraggling Highland soldiers of a band.\n\n\u2014Ci rifletter\u00f2, Stephen said, glancing down the solid trouserleg.\n\n\u2014Ma, sul serio, eh? Almidano Artifoni said.\n\nHis heavy hand took Stephen\u2019s firmly. Human eyes. They gazed curiously an\ninstant and turned quickly towards a Dalkey tram.\n\n\u2014Eccolo, Almidano Artifoni said in friendly haste. Venga a trovarmi e ci\npensi. Addio, caro.\n\n\u2014Arrivederla, maestro, Stephen said, raising his hat when his hand was freed.\nE grazie.\n\n\u2014Di che? Almidano Artifoni said. Scusi, eh? Tante belle cose!\n\nAlmidano Artifoni, holding up a baton of rolled music as a signal, trotted on\nstout trousers after the Dalkey tram. In vain he trotted, signalling in vain\namong the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling implements of music through\nTrinity gates.\n\nMiss Dunne hid the Capel street library copy of The Woman in White far back in\nher drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into her typewriter.\n\nToo much mystery business in it. Is he in love with that one, Marion? Change\nit and get another by Mary Cecil Haye.\n\nThe disk shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased and ogled them: six.\n\nMiss Dunne clicked on the keyboard:\n\n\u201416 June 1904.\n\nFive tallwhitehatted sandwichmen between Monypeny\u2019s corner and the slab where\nWolfe Tone\u2019s statue was not, eeled themselves turning H. E. L. Y\u2019S and plodded\nback as they had come.\n\nThen she stared at the large poster of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, and,\nlistlessly lolling, scribbled on the jotter sixteens and capital esses.\nMustard hair and dauby cheeks. She\u2019s not nicelooking, is she? The way she\u2019s\nholding up her bit of a skirt. Wonder will that fellow be at the band tonight.\nIf I could get that dressmaker to make a concertina skirt like Susy Nagle\u2019s.\nThey kick out grand. Shannon and all the boatclub swells never took his eyes\noff her. Hope to goodness he won\u2019t keep me here till seven.\n\nThe telephone rang rudely by her ear.\n\n\u2014Hello. Yes, sir. No, sir. Yes, sir. I\u2019ll ring them up after five. Only those\ntwo, sir, for Belfast and Liverpool. All right, sir. Then I can go after six\nif you\u2019re not back. A quarter after. Yes, sir. Twentyseven and six. I\u2019ll tell\nhim. Yes: one, seven, six.\n\nShe scribbled three figures on an envelope.\n\n\u2014Mr Boylan! Hello! That gentleman from Sport was in looking for you. Mr\nLenehan, yes. He said he\u2019ll be in the Ormond at four. No, sir. Yes, sir. I\u2019ll\nring them up after five.\n\nTwo pink faces turned in the flare of the tiny torch.\n\n\u2014Who\u2019s that? Ned Lambert asked. Is that Crotty?\n\n\u2014Ringabella and Crosshaven, a voice replied groping for foothold.\n\n\u2014Hello, Jack, is that yourself? Ned Lambert said, raising in salute his pliant\nlath among the flickering arches. Come on. Mind your steps there.\n\nThe vesta in the clergyman\u2019s uplifted hand consumed itself in a long soft\nflame and was let fall. At their feet its red speck died: and mouldy air\nclosed round them.\n\n\u2014How interesting! a refined accent said in the gloom.\n\n\u2014Yes, sir, Ned Lambert said heartily. We are standing in the historic council\nchamber of saint Mary\u2019s abbey where silken Thomas proclaimed himself a rebel\nin 1534. This is the most historic spot in all Dublin. O\u2019Madden Burke is going\nto write something about it one of these days. The old bank of Ireland was\nover the way till the time of the union and the original jews\u2019 temple was here\ntoo before they built their synagogue over in Adelaide road. You were never\nhere before, Jack, were you?\n\n\u2014No, Ned.\n\n\u2014He rode down through Dame walk, the refined accent said, if my memory serves\nme. The mansion of the Kildares was in Thomas court.\n\n\u2014That\u2019s right, Ned Lambert said. That\u2019s quite right, sir.\n\n\u2014If you will be so kind then, the clergyman said, the next time to allow me\nperhaps ....\n\n\u2014Certainly, Ned Lambert said. Bring the camera whenever you like. I\u2019ll get\nthose bags cleared away from the windows. You can take it from here or from\nhere.\n\nIn the still faint light he moved about, tapping with his lath the piled\nseedbags and points of vantage on the floor.\n\nFrom a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard.\n\n\u2014I\u2019m deeply obliged, Mr Lambert, the clergyman said. I won\u2019t trespass on your\nvaluable time ....\n\n\u2014You\u2019re welcome, sir, Ned Lambert said. Drop in whenever you like. Next week,\nsay. Can you see?\n\n\u2014Yes, yes. Good afternoon, Mr Lambert. Very pleased to have met you.\n\n\u2014Pleasure is mine, sir, Ned Lambert answered.\n\nHe followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away among the\npillars. With J. J. O\u2019Molloy he came forth slowly into Mary\u2019s abbey where\ndraymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnut meal, O\u2019Connor,\nWexford.\n\nHe stood to read the card in his hand.\n\n\u2014The reverend Hugh C. Love, Rathcoffey. Present address: Saint Michael\u2019s,\nSallins. Nice young chap he is. He\u2019s writing a book about the Fitzgeralds he\ntold me. He\u2019s well up in history, faith.\n\nThe young woman with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.\n\n\u2014I thought you were at a new gunpowder plot, J. J. O\u2019Molloy said.\n\nNed Lambert cracked his fingers in the air.\n\n\u2014God! he cried. I forgot to tell him that one about the earl of Kildare after\nhe set fire to Cashel cathedral. You know that one? I\u2019m bloody sorry I did it,\nsays he, but I declare to God I thought the archbishop was inside. He mightn\u2019t\nlike it, though. What? God, I\u2019ll tell him anyhow. That was the great earl, the\nFitzgerald Mor. Hot members they were all of them, the Geraldines.\n\nThe horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness. He slapped a\npiebald haunch quivering near him and cried:\n\n\u2014Woa, sonny!\n\nHe turned to J. J. O\u2019Molloy and asked:\n\n\u2014Well, Jack. What is it? What\u2019s the trouble? Wait awhile. Hold hard.\n\nWith gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and, after an instant,\nsneezed loudly.\n\n\u2014Chow! he said. Blast you!\n\n\u2014The dust from those sacks, J. J. O\u2019Molloy said politely.\n\n\u2014No, Ned Lambert gasped, I caught a .... cold night before .... blast your\nsoul ... night before last ... and there was a hell of a lot of draught ....\n\nHe held his handkerchief ready for the coming ...\n\n\u2014I was .... Glasnevin this morning ... poor little ... what do you call him\n... Chow! ... Mother of Moses!\n\nTom Rochford took the top disk from the pile he clasped against his claret\nwaistcoat.\n\n\u2014See? he said. Say it\u2019s turn six. In here, see. Turn Now On.\n\nHe slid it into the left slot for them. It shot down the groove, wobbled a\nwhile, ceased, ogling them: six.\n\nLawyers of the past, haughty, pleading, beheld pass from the consolidated\ntaxing office to Nisi Prius court Richie Goulding carrying the costbag of\nGoulding, Collis and Ward and heard rustling from the admiralty division of\nking\u2019s bench to the court of appeal an elderly female with false teeth smiling\nincredulously and a black silk skirt of great amplitude.\n\n\u2014See? he said. See now the last one I put in is over here: Turns Over. The\nimpact. Leverage, see?\n\nHe showed them the rising column of disks on the right.\n\n\u2014Smart idea, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling. So a fellow coming in late can see\nwhat turn is on and what turns are over.\n\n\u2014See? Tom Rochford said.\n\nHe slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle, stop: four.\nTurn Now On.\n\n\u2014I\u2019ll see him now in the Ormond, Lenehan said, and sound him. One good turn\ndeserves another.\n\n\u2014Do, Tom Rochford said. Tell him I\u2019m Boylan with impatience.\n\n\u2014Goodnight, M\u2018Coy said abruptly. When you two begin .....\n\nNosey Flynn stooped towards the lever, snuffling at it.\n\n\u2014But how does it work here, Tommy? he asked.\n\n\u2014Tooraloo, Lenehan said. See you later.\n\nHe followed M\u2018Coy out across the tiny square of Crampton court.\n\n\u2014He\u2019s a hero, he said simply.\n\n\u2014I know, M\u2018Coy said. The drain, you mean.\n\n\u2014Drain? Lenehan said. It was down a manhole.\n\nThey passed Dan Lowry\u2019s musichall where Marie Kendall, charming soubrette,\nsmiled on them from a poster a dauby smile.\n\nGoing down the path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichall Lenehan\nshowed M\u2018Coy how the whole thing was. One of those manholes like a bloody\ngaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it, half choked with sewer\ngas. Down went Tom Rochford anyhow, booky\u2019s vest and all, with the rope round\nhim. And be damned but he got the rope round the poor devil and the two were\nhauled up.\n\n\u2014The act of a hero, he said.\n\nAt the Dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past them for\nJervis street.\n\n\u2014This way, he said, walking to the right. I want to pop into Lynam\u2019s to see\nSceptre\u2019s starting price. What\u2019s the time by your gold watch and chain?\n\nM\u2018Coy peered into Marcus Tertius Moses\u2019 sombre office , then at O\u2019Neill\u2019s\nclock.\n\n\u2014After three, he said. Who\u2019s riding her?\n\n\u2014O. Madden, Lenehan said. And a game filly she is.\n\nWhile he waited in Temple bar M\u2018Coy dodged a banana peel with gentle pushes of\nhis toe from the path to the gutter. Fellow might damn easy get a nasty fall\nthere coming along tight in the dark.\n\nThe gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal cavalcade.\n\n\u2014Even money, Lenehan said returning. I knocked against Bantam Lyons in there\ngoing to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasn\u2019t an earthly. Through\nhere.\n\nThey went up the steps and under Merchants\u2019 arch. A darkbacked figure scanned\nbooks on the hawker\u2019s cart.\n\n\u2014There he is, Lenehan said.\n\n\u2014Wonder what he\u2019s buying, M\u2018Coy said, glancing behind.\n\n\u2014Leopoldo or the Bloom is on the Rye, Lenehan said.\n\n\u2014He\u2019s dead nuts on sales, M\u2018Coy said. I was with him one day and he bought a\nbook from an old one in Liffey street for two bob. There were fine plates in\nit worth double the money, the stars and the moon and comets with long tails.\nAstronomy it was about.\n\nLenehan laughed.\n\n\u2014I\u2019ll tell you a damn good one about comets\u2019 tails, he said. Come over in the\nsun.\n\nThey crossed to the metal bridge and went along Wellington quay by the\nriverwall.\n\nMaster Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of Mangan\u2019s, late Fehrenbach\u2019s,\ncarrying a pound and a half of porksteaks.\n\n\u2014There was a long spread out at Glencree reformatory, Lenehan said eagerly.\nThe annual dinner, you know. Boiled shirt affair. The lord mayor was there,\nVal Dillon it was, and sir Charles Cameron and Dan Dawson spoke and there was\nmusic. Bartell d\u2019Arcy sang and Benjamin Dollard .....\n\n\u2014I know, M\u2018Coy broke in. My missus sang there once.\n\n\u2014Did she? Lenehan said.\n\nA card Unfurnished Apartments reappeared on the windowsash of number 7 Eccles\nstreet.\n\nHe checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh.\n\n\u2014But wait till I tell you, he said. Delahunt of Camden street had the catering\nand yours truly was chief bottlewasher. Bloom and the wife were there.\nLashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and cura\u00e7oa to which we did\nample justice. Fast and furious it was. After liquids came solids. Cold joints\ngalore and mince pies ....\n\n\u2014I know, M\u2018Coy said. The year the missus was there .....\n\nLenehan linked his arm warmly.\n\n\u2014But wait till I tell you, he said. We had a midnight lunch too after all the\njollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o\u2019clock the morning after\nthe night before. Coming home it was a gorgeous winter\u2019s night on the\nFeatherbed Mountain. Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one side of the car and\nI was with the wife on the other. We started singing glees and duets: Lo, the\nearly beam of morning. She was well primed with a good load of Delahunt\u2019s port\nunder her bellyband. Every jolt the bloody car gave I had her bumping up\nagainst me. Hell\u2019s delights! She has a fine pair, God bless her. Like that.\n\nHe held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning:\n\n\u2014I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time. Know what\nI mean?\n\nHis hands moulded ample curves of air. He shut his eyes tight in delight, his\nbody shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips.\n\n\u2014The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh. She\u2019s a gamey mare\nand no mistake. Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the comets in the\nheavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey: the great bear and Hercules and the\ndragon, and the whole jingbang lot. But, by God, I was lost, so to speak, in\nthe milky way. He knows them all, faith. At last she spotted a weeny weeshy\none miles away. And what star is that, Poldy? says she. By God, she had Bloom\ncornered. That one, is it? says Chris Callinan, sure that\u2019s only what you\nmight call a pinprick. By God, he wasn\u2019t far wide of the mark.\n\nLenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with soft laughter.\n\n\u2014I\u2019m weak, he gasped.\n\nM\u2018Coy\u2019s white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave. Lenehan walked\non again. He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead rapidly. He\nglanced sideways in the sunlight at M\u2018Coy.\n\n\u2014He\u2019s a cultured allroundman, Bloom is, he said seriously. He\u2019s not one of\nyour common or garden ... you know ... There\u2019s a touch of the artist about old\nBloom.\n\nMr Bloom turned over idly pages of The Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk, then\nof Aristotle\u2019s Masterpiece. Crooked botched print. Plates: infants cuddled in\na ball in bloodred wombs like livers of slaughtered cows. Lots of them like\nthat at this moment all over the world. All butting with their skulls to get\nout of it. Child born every minute somewhere. Mrs Purefoy.\n\nHe laid both books aside and glanced at the third: Tales of the Ghetto by\nLeopold von Sacher Masoch.\n\n\u2014That I had, he said, pushing it by.\n\nThe shopman let two volumes fall on the counter.\n\n\u2014Them are two good ones, he said.\n\nOnions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth. He bent\nto make a bundle of the other books, hugged them against his unbuttoned\nwaistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain.\n\nOn O\u2019Connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay apparel\nof Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c.\n\nMr Bloom, alone, looked at the titles. Fair Tyrants by James Lovebirch. Know\nthe kind that is. Had it? Yes.\n\nHe opened it. Thought so.\n\nA woman\u2019s voice behind the dingy curtain. Listen: the man.\n\nNo: she wouldn\u2019t like that much. Got her it once.\n\nHe read the other title: Sweets of Sin. More in her line. Let us see.\n\nHe read where his finger opened.\n\n\u2014All the dollarbills her husband gave her were spent in the stores on wondrous\ngowns and costliest frillies. For him! For Raoul!\n\nYes. This. Here. Try.\n\n\u2014Her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss while his hands felt for\nthe opulent curves inside her deshabille.\n\nYes. Take this. The end.\n\n\u2014You are late, he spoke hoarsely, eying her with a suspicious glare.\n\nThe beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap, displaying her queenly\nshoulders and heaving embonpoint. An imperceptible smile played round her\nperfect lips as she turned to him calmly.\n\nMr Bloom read again: The beautiful woman ....\n\nWarmth showered gently over him, cowing his flesh. Flesh yielded amply amid\nrumpled clothes: whites of eyes swooning up. His nostrils arched themselves\nfor prey. Melting breast ointments (for him! For Raoul!). Armpits\u2019 oniony\nsweat. Fishgluey slime (her heaving embonpoint!). Feel! Press! Chrished!\nSulphur dung of lions!\n\nYoung! Young!\n\nAn elderly female, no more young, left the building of the courts of chancery,\nking\u2019s bench, exchequer and common pleas, having heard in the lord\nchancellor\u2019s court the case in lunacy of Potterton, in the admiralty division\nthe summons, exparte motion, of the owners of the Lady Cairns versus the\nowners of the barque Mona, in the court of appeal reservation of judgment in\nthe case of Harvey versus the Ocean Accident and Guarantee Corporation.\n\nPhlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop, bulging out the dingy curtains.\nThe shopman\u2019s uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven reddened face,\ncoughing. He raked his throat rudely, puked phlegm on the floor. He put his\nboot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along it, and bent, showing a\nrawskinned crown, scantily haired.\n\nMr Bloom beheld it.\n\nMastering his troubled breath, he said:\n\n\u2014I\u2019ll take this one.\n\nThe shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum.\n\n\u2014Sweets of Sin, he said, tapping on it. That\u2019s a good one.\n\nThe lacquey by the door of Dillon\u2019s auctionrooms shook his handbell twice\nagain and viewed himself in the chalked mirror of the cabinet.\n\nDilly Dedalus, loitering by the curbstone, heard the beats of the bell, the\ncries of the auctioneer within. Four and nine. Those lovely curtains. Five\nshillings. Cosy curtains. Selling new at two guineas. Any advance on five\nshillings? Going for five shillings.\n\nThe lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it:\n\n\u2014Barang!\n\nBang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint. J. A.\nJackson, W. E. Wylie, A. Munro and H. T. Gahan, their stretched necks wagging,\nnegotiated the curve by the College library.\n\nMr Dedalus, tugging a long moustache, came round from Williams\u2019s row. He\nhalted near his daughter.\n\n\u2014It\u2019s time for you, she said.\n\n\u2014Stand up straight for the love of the lord Jesus, Mr Dedalus said. Are you\ntrying to imitate your uncle John, the cornetplayer, head upon shoulder?\nMelancholy God!\n\nDilly shrugged her shoulders. Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them and held\nthem back.\n\n\u2014Stand up straight, girl, he said. You\u2019ll get curvature of the spine. Do you\nknow what you look like?\n\nHe let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching his shoulders and\ndropping his underjaw.\n\n\u2014Give it up, father, Dilly said. All the people are looking at you.\n\nMr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache.\n\n\u2014Did you get any money? Dilly asked.\n\n\u2014Where would I get money? Mr Dedalus said. There is no-one in Dublin would\nlend me fourpence.\n\n\u2014You got some, Dilly said, looking in his eyes.\n\n\u2014How do you know that? Mr Dedalus asked, his tongue in his cheek.\n\nMr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldly along James\u2019s\nstreet.\n\n\u2014I know you did, Dilly answered. Were you in the Scotch house now?\n\n\u2014I was not, then, Mr Dedalus said, smiling. Was it the little nuns taught you\nto be so saucy? Here.\n\nHe handed her a shilling.\n\n\u2014See if you can do anything with that, he said.\n\n\u2014I suppose you got five, Dilly said. Give me more than that.\n\n\u2014Wait awhile, Mr Dedalus said threateningly. You\u2019re like the rest of them, are\nyou? An insolent pack of little bitches since your poor mother died. But wait\nawhile. You\u2019ll all get a short shrift and a long day from me. Low\nblackguardism! I\u2019m going to get rid of you. Wouldn\u2019t care if I was stretched\nout stiff. He\u2019s dead. The man upstairs is dead.\n\nHe left her and walked on. Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat.\n\n\u2014Well, what is it? he said, stopping.\n\nThe lacquey rang his bell behind their backs.\n\n\u2014Barang!\n\n\u2014Curse your bloody blatant soul, Mr Dedalus cried, turning on him.\n\nThe lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bell but\nfeebly:\n\n\u2014Bang!\n\nMr Dedalus stared at him.\n\n\u2014Watch him, he said. It\u2019s instructive. I wonder will he allow us to talk.\n\n\u2014You got more than that, father, Dilly said.\n\n\u2014I\u2019m going to show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus said. I\u2019ll leave you all\nwhere Jesus left the jews. Look, there\u2019s all I have. I got two shillings from\nJack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for the funeral.\n\nHe drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously.\n\n\u2014Can\u2019t you look for some money somewhere? Dilly said.\n\nMr Dedalus thought and nodded.\n\n\u2014I will, he said gravely. I looked all along the gutter in O\u2019Connell street.\nI\u2019ll try this one now.\n\n\u2014You\u2019re very funny, Dilly said, grinning.\n\n\u2014Here, Mr Dedalus said, handing her two pennies. Get a glass of milk for\nyourself and a bun or a something. I\u2019ll be home shortly.\n\nHe put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on.\n\nThe viceregal cavalcade passed, greeted by obsequious policemen, out of\nParkgate.\n\n\u2014I\u2019m sure you have another shilling, Dilly said.\n\nThe lacquey banged loudly.\n\nMr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with a pursing\nmincing mouth gently:\n\n\u2014The little nuns! Nice little things! O, sure they wouldn\u2019t do anything! O,\nsure they wouldn\u2019t really! Is it little sister Monica!\n\nFrom the sundial towards James\u2019s gate walked Mr Kernan, pleased with the order\nhe had booked for Pulbrook Robertson, boldly along James\u2019s street, past\nShackleton\u2019s offices. Got round him all right. How do you do, Mr Crimmins?\nFirst rate, sir. I was afraid you might be up in your other establishment in\nPimlico. How are things going? Just keeping alive. Lovely weather we\u2019re\nhaving. Yes, indeed. Good for the country. Those farmers are always grumbling.\nI\u2019ll just take a thimbleful of your best gin, Mr Crimmins. A small gin, sir.\nYes, sir. Terrible affair that General Slocum explosion. Terrible, terrible! A\nthousand casualties. And heartrending scenes. Men trampling down women and\nchildren. Most brutal thing. What do they say was the cause? Spontaneous\ncombustion. Most scandalous revelation. Not a single lifeboat would float and\nthe firehose all burst. What I can\u2019t understand is how the inspectors ever\nallowed a boat like that... Now, you\u2019re talking straight, Mr Crimmins. You\nknow why? Palm oil. Is that a fact? Without a doubt. Well now, look at that.\nAnd America they say is the land of the free. I thought we were bad here.\n\nI smiled at him. America, I said quietly, just like that. What is it? The\nsweepings of every country including our own. Isn\u2019t that true? That\u2019s a fact.\n\nGraft, my dear sir. Well, of course, where there\u2019s money going there\u2019s always\nsomeone to pick it up.\n\nSaw him looking at my frockcoat. Dress does it. Nothing like a dressy\nappearance. Bowls them over.\n\n\u2014Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. How are things?\n\n\u2014Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.\n\nMr Kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of Peter\nKennedy, hairdresser. Stylish coat, beyond a doubt. Scott of Dawson street.\nWell worth the half sovereign I gave Neary for it. Never built under three\nguineas. Fits me down to the ground. Some Kildare street club toff had it\nprobably. John Mulligan, the manager of the Hibernian bank, gave me a very\nsharp eye yesterday on Carlisle bridge as if he remembered me.\n\nAham! Must dress the character for those fellows. Knight of the road.\nGentleman. And now, Mr Crimmins, may we have the honour of your custom again,\nsir. The cup that cheers but not inebriates, as the old saying has it.\n\nNorth wall and sir John Rogerson\u2019s quay, with hulls and anchorchains, sailing\nwestward, sailed by a skiff, a crumpled throwaway, rocked on the ferrywash,\nElijah is coming.\n\nMr Kernan glanced in farewell at his image. High colour, of course. Grizzled\nmoustache. Returned Indian officer. Bravely he bore his stumpy body forward on\nspatted feet, squaring his shoulders. Is that Ned Lambert\u2019s brother over the\nway, Sam? What? Yes. He\u2019s as like it as damn it. No. The windscreen of that\nmotorcar in the sun there. Just a flash like that. Damn like him.\n\nAham! Hot spirit of juniper juice warmed his vitals and his breath. Good drop\nof gin, that was. His frocktails winked in bright sunshine to his fat strut.\n\nDown there Emmet was hanged, drawn and quartered. Greasy black rope. Dogs\nlicking the blood off the street when the lord lieutenant\u2019s wife drove by in\nher noddy.\n\nBad times those were. Well, well. Over and done with. Great topers too.\nFourbottle men.\n\nLet me see. Is he buried in saint Michan\u2019s? Or no, there was a midnight burial\nin Glasnevin. Corpse brought in through a secret door in the wall. Dignam is\nthere now. Went out in a puff. Well, well. Better turn down here. Make a\ndetour.\n\nMr Kernan turned and walked down the slope of Watling street by the corner of\nGuinness\u2019s visitors\u2019 waitingroom. Outside the Dublin Distillers Company\u2019s\nstores an outside car without fare or jarvey stood, the reins knotted to the\nwheel. Damn dangerous thing. Some Tipperary bosthoon endangering the lives of\nthe citizens. Runaway horse.\n\nDenis Breen with his tomes, weary of having waited an hour in John Henry\nMenton\u2019s office, led his wife over O\u2019Connell bridge, bound for the office of\nMessrs Collis and Ward.\n\nMr Kernan approached Island street.\n\nTimes of the troubles. Must ask Ned Lambert to lend me those reminiscences of\nsir Jonah Barrington. When you look back on it all now in a kind of\nretrospective arrangement. Gaming at Daly\u2019s. No cardsharping then. One of\nthose fellows got his hand nailed to the table by a dagger. Somewhere here\nlord Edward Fitzgerald escaped from major Sirr. Stables behind Moira house.\n\nDamn good gin that was.\n\nFine dashing young nobleman. Good stock, of course. That ruffian, that sham\nsquire, with his violet gloves gave him away. Course they were on the wrong\nside. They rose in dark and evil days. Fine poem that is: Ingram. They were\ngentlemen. Ben Dollard does sing that ballad touchingly. Masterly rendition.\n\nAt the siege of Ross did my father fall.\n\nA cavalcade in easy trot along Pembroke quay passed, outriders leaping,\nleaping in their, in their saddles. Frockcoats. Cream sunshades.\n\nMr Kernan hurried forward, blowing pursily.\n\nHis Excellency! Too bad! Just missed that by a hair. Damn it! What a pity!\n\nStephen Dedalus watched through the webbed window the lapidary\u2019s fingers prove\na timedulled chain. Dust webbed the window and the showtrays. Dust darkened\nthe toiling fingers with their vulture nails. Dust slept on dull coils of\nbronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar, on rubies, leprous and winedark\nstones.\n\nBorn all in the dark wormy earth, cold specks of fire, evil, lights shining in\nthe darkness. Where fallen archangels flung the stars of their brows. Muddy\nswinesnouts, hands, root and root, gripe and wrest them.\n\nShe dances in a foul gloom where gum bums with garlic. A sailorman,\nrustbearded, sips from a beaker rum and eyes her. A long and seafed silent\nrut. She dances, capers, wagging her sowish haunches and her hips, on her\ngross belly flapping a ruby egg.\n\nOld Russell with a smeared shammy rag burnished again his gem, turned it and\nheld it at the point of his Moses\u2019 beard. Grandfather ape gloating on a stolen\nhoard.\n\nAnd you who wrest old images from the burial earth? The brainsick words of\nsophists: Antisthenes. A lore of drugs. Orient and immortal wheat standing\nfrom everlasting to everlasting.\n\nTwo old women fresh from their whiff of the briny trudged through Irishtown\nalong London bridge road, one with a sanded tired umbrella, one with a\nmidwife\u2019s bag in which eleven cockles rolled.\n\nThe whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from the powerhouse\nurged Stephen to be on. Beingless beings. Stop! Throb always without you and\nthe throb always within. Your heart you sing of. I between them. Where?\nBetween two roaring worlds where they swirl, I. Shatter them, one and both.\nBut stun myself too in the blow. Shatter me you who can. Bawd and butcher were\nthe words. I say! Not yet awhile. A look around.\n\nYes, quite true. Very large and wonderful and keeps famous time. You say\nright, sir. A Monday morning, \u2019twas so, indeed.\n\nStephen went down Bedford row, the handle of the ash clacking against his\nshoulderblade. In Clohissey\u2019s window a faded 1860 print of Heenan boxing\nSayers held his eye. Staring backers with square hats stood round the roped\nprizering. The heavyweights in tight loincloths proposed gently each to other\nhis bulbous fists. And they are throbbing: heroes\u2019 hearts.\n\nHe turned and halted by the slanted bookcart.\n\n\u2014Twopence each, the huckster said. Four for sixpence.\n\nTattered pages. The Irish Beekeeper. Life and Miracles of the Cur\u00e9 of Ars.\nPocket Guide to Killarney.\n\nI might find here one of my pawned schoolprizes. Stephano Dedalo, alumno\noptimo, palmam ferenti.\n\nFather Conmee, having read his little hours, walked through the hamlet of\nDonnycarney, murmuring vespers.\n\nBinding too good probably. What is this? Eighth and ninth book of Moses.\nSecret of all secrets. Seal of King David. Thumbed pages: read and read. Who\nhas passed here before me? How to soften chapped hands. Recipe for white wine\nvinegar. How to win a woman\u2019s love. For me this. Say the following talisman\nthree times with hands folded:\n\n\u2014Se el yilo nebrakada femininum! Amor me solo! Sanktus! Amen.\n\nWho wrote this? Charms and invocations of the most blessed abbot Peter Salanka\nto all true believers divulged. As good as any other abbot\u2019s charms, as\nmumbling Joachim\u2019s. Down, baldynoddle, or we\u2019ll wool your wool.\n\n\u2014What are you doing here, Stephen?\n\nDilly\u2019s high shoulders and shabby dress.\n\nShut the book quick. Don\u2019t let see.\n\n\u2014What are you doing? Stephen said.\n\nA Stuart face of nonesuch Charles, lank locks falling at its sides. It glowed\nas she crouched feeding the fire with broken boots. I told her of Paris. Late\nlieabed under a quilt of old overcoats, fingering a pinchbeck bracelet, Dan\nKelly\u2019s token. Nebrakada femininum.\n\n\u2014What have you there? Stephen asked.\n\n\u2014I bought it from the other cart for a penny, Dilly said, laughing nervously.\nIs it any good?\n\nMy eyes they say she has. Do others see me so? Quick, far and daring. Shadow\nof my mind.\n\nHe took the coverless book from her hand. Chardenal\u2019s French primer.\n\n\u2014What did you buy that for? he asked. To learn French?\n\nShe nodded, reddening and closing tight her lips.\n\nShow no surprise. Quite natural.\n\n\u2014Here, Stephen said. It\u2019s all right. Mind Maggy doesn\u2019t pawn it on you. I\nsuppose all my books are gone.\n\n\u2014Some, Dilly said. We had to.\n\nShe is drowning. Agenbite. Save her. Agenbite. All against us. She will drown\nme with her, eyes and hair. Lank coils of seaweed hair around me, my heart, my\nsoul. Salt green death.\n\nWe.\n\nAgenbite of inwit. Inwit\u2019s agenbite.\n\nMisery! Misery!\n\n\u2014Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. How are things?\n\n\u2014Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.\n\nThey clasped hands loudly outside Reddy and Daughter\u2019s. Father Cowley brushed\nhis moustache often downward with a scooping hand.\n\n\u2014What\u2019s the best news? Mr Dedalus said.\n\n\u2014Why then not much, Father Cowley said. I\u2019m barricaded up, Simon, with two men\nprowling around the house trying to effect an entrance.\n\n\u2014Jolly, Mr Dedalus said. Who is it?\n\n\u2014O, Father Cowley said. A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance.\n\n\u2014With a broken back, is it? Mr Dedalus asked.\n\n\u2014The same, Simon, Father Cowley answered. Reuben of that ilk. I\u2019m just waiting\nfor Ben Dollard. He\u2019s going to say a word to long John to get him to take\nthose two men off. All I want is a little time.\n\nHe looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in his\nneck.\n\n\u2014I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Poor old bockedy Ben! He\u2019s always doing a\ngood turn for someone. Hold hard!\n\nHe put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant.\n\n\u2014Here he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets.\n\nBen Dollard\u2019s loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops crossed the\nquay in full gait from the metal bridge. He came towards them at an amble,\nscratching actively behind his coattails.\n\nAs he came near Mr Dedalus greeted:\n\n\u2014Hold that fellow with the bad trousers.\n\n\u2014Hold him now, Ben Dollard said.\n\nMr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben Dollard\u2019s\nfigure. Then, turning to Father Cowley with a nod, he muttered sneeringly:\n\n\u2014That\u2019s a pretty garment, isn\u2019t it, for a summer\u2019s day?\n\n\u2014Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously, I threw\nout more clothes in my time than you ever saw.\n\nHe stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes from\npoints of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying:\n\n\u2014They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow.\n\n\u2014Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said. Thanks be to God\nhe\u2019s not paid yet.\n\n\u2014And how is that basso profondo, Benjamin? Father Cowley asked.\n\nCashel Boyle O\u2019Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, murmuring, glassyeyed,\nstrode past the Kildare street club.\n\nBen Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter\u2019s mouth, gave forth a deep\nnote.\n\n\u2014Aw! he said.\n\n\u2014That\u2019s the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone.\n\n\u2014What about that? Ben Dollard said. Not too dusty? What?\n\nHe turned to both.\n\n\u2014That\u2019ll do, Father Cowley said, nodding also.\n\nThe reverend Hugh C. Love walked from the old chapterhouse of saint Mary\u2019s\nabbey past James and Charles Kennedy\u2019s, rectifiers, attended by Geraldines\ntall and personable, towards the Tholsel beyond the ford of hurdles.\n\nBen Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward, his\njoyful fingers in the air.\n\n\u2014Come along with me to the subsheriff\u2019s office, he said. I want to show you\nthe new beauty Rock has for a bailiff. He\u2019s a cross between Lobengula and\nLynchehaun. He\u2019s well worth seeing, mind you. Come along. I saw John Henry\nMenton casually in the Bodega just now and it will cost me a fall if I don\u2019t\n... Wait awhile ..... We\u2019re on the right lay, Bob, believe you me.\n\n\u2014For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously.\n\nBen Dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button of his\ncoat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the heavy shraums\nthat clogged his eyes to hear aright.\n\n\u2014What few days? he boomed. Hasn\u2019t your landlord distrained for rent?\n\n\u2014He has, Father Cowley said.\n\n\u2014Then our friend\u2019s writ is not worth the paper it\u2019s printed on, Ben Dollard\nsaid. The landlord has the prior claim. I gave him all the particulars. 29\nWindsor avenue. Love is the name?\n\n\u2014That\u2019s right, Father Cowley said. The reverend Mr Love. He\u2019s a minister in\nthe country somewhere. But are you sure of that?\n\n\u2014You can tell Barabbas from me, Ben Dollard said, that he can put that writ\nwhere Jacko put the nuts.\n\nHe led Father Cowley boldly forward, linked to his bulk.\n\n\u2014Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he dropped his glasses on\nhis coatfront, following them.\n\n\u2014The youngster will be all right, Martin Cunningham said, as they passed out\nof the Castleyard gate.\n\nThe policeman touched his forehead.\n\n\u2014God bless you, Martin Cunningham said, cheerily.\n\nHe signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on towards\nLord Edward street.\n\nBronze by gold, Miss Kennedy\u2019s head by Miss Douce\u2019s head, appeared above the\ncrossblind of the Ormond hotel.\n\n\u2014Yes, Martin Cunningham said, fingering his beard. I wrote to Father Conmee\nand laid the whole case before him.\n\n\u2014You could try our friend, Mr Power suggested backward.\n\n\u2014Boyd? Martin Cunningham said shortly. Touch me not.\n\nJohn Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them quickly\ndown Cork hill.\n\nOn the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti, descending, hailed Alderman\nCowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending.\n\nThe castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street.\n\n\u2014Look here, Martin, John Wyse Nolan said, overtaking them at the Mail office.\nI see Bloom put his name down for five shillings.\n\n\u2014Quite right, Martin Cunningham said, taking the list. And put down the five\nshillings too.\n\n\u2014Without a second word either, Mr Power said.\n\n\u2014Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added.\n\nJohn Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes.\n\n\u2014I\u2019ll say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted, elegantly.\n\nThey went down Parliament street.\n\n\u2014There\u2019s Jimmy Henry, Mr Power said, just heading for Kavanagh\u2019s.\n\n\u2014Righto, Martin Cunningham said. Here goes.\n\nOutside la Maison Claire Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney\u2019s brother-in-law,\nhumpy, tight, making for the liberties.\n\nJohn Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while Martin Cunningham took the\nelbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit, who walked uncertainly,\nwith hasty steps past Micky Anderson\u2019s watches.\n\n\u2014The assistant town clerk\u2019s corns are giving him some trouble, John Wyse Nolan\ntold Mr Power.\n\nThey followed round the corner towards James Kavanagh\u2019s winerooms. The empty\ncastle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate. Martin Cunningham, speaking\nalways, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not glance.\n\n\u2014And long John Fanning is here too, John Wyse Nolan said, as large as life.\n\nThe tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood.\n\n\u2014Good day, Mr Subsheriff, Martin Cunningham said, as all halted and greeted.\n\nLong John Fanning made no way for them. He removed his large Henry Clay\ndecisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all their\nfaces.\n\n\u2014Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations? he said with\nrich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk.\n\nHell open to christians they were having, Jimmy Henry said pettishly, about\ntheir damned Irish language. Where was the marshal, he wanted to know, to keep\norder in the council chamber. And old Barlow the macebearer laid up with\nasthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order, no quorum even, and\nHutchinson, the lord mayor, in Llandudno and little Lorcan Sherlock doing\nlocum tenens for him. Damned Irish language, language of our forefathers.\n\nLong John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips.\n\nMartin Cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, to the\nassistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan held his peace.\n\n\u2014What Dignam was that? long John Fanning asked.\n\nJimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot.\n\n\u2014O, my corns! he said plaintively. Come upstairs for goodness\u2019 sake till I sit\ndown somewhere. Uff! Ooo! Mind!\n\nTestily he made room for himself beside long John Fanning\u2019s flank and passed\nin and up the stairs.\n\n\u2014Come on up, Martin Cunningham said to the subsheriff. I don\u2019t think you knew\nhim or perhaps you did, though.\n\nWith John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in.\n\n\u2014Decent little soul he was, Mr Power said to the stalwart back of long John\nFanning ascending towards long John Fanning in the mirror.\n\n\u2014Rather lowsized. Dignam of Menton\u2019s office that was, Martin Cunningham said.\n\nLong John Fanning could not remember him.\n\nClatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air.\n\n\u2014What\u2019s that? Martin Cunningham said.\n\nAll turned where they stood. John Wyse Nolan came down again. From the cool\nshadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street, harness and\nglossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering. Gaily they went past before his cool\nunfriendly eyes, not quickly. In saddles of the leaders, leaping leaders, rode\noutriders.\n\n\u2014What was it? Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up the staircase.\n\n\u2014The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland, John Wyse Nolan\nanswered from the stairfoot.\n\nAs they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his Panama\nto Haines:\n\n\u2014Parnell\u2019s brother. There in the corner.\n\nThey chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man whose beard\nand gaze hung intently down on a chessboard.\n\n\u2014Is that he? Haines asked, twisting round in his seat.\n\n\u2014Yes, Mulligan said. That\u2019s John Howard, his brother, our city marshal.\n\nJohn Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw went\nup again to his forehead whereat it rested. An instant after, under its\nscreen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and fell once more\nupon a working corner.\n\n\u2014I\u2019ll take a m\u00e9lange, Haines said to the waitress.\n\n\u2014Two m\u00e9langes, Buck Mulligan said. And bring us some scones and butter and\nsome cakes as well.\n\nWhen she had gone he said, laughing:\n\n\u2014We call it D. B. C. because they have damn bad cakes. O, but you missed\nDedalus on Hamlet.\n\nHaines opened his newbought book.\n\n\u2014I\u2019m sorry, he said. Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all minds that\nhave lost their balance.\n\nThe onelegged sailor growled at the area of 14 Nelson street:\n\n\u2014England expects .....\n\nBuck Mulligan\u2019s primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter.\n\n\u2014You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance. Wandering\nAengus I call him.\n\n\u2014I am sure he has an id\u00e9e fixe, Haines said, pinching his chin thoughtfully\nwith thumb and forefinger. Now I am speculating what it would be likely to be.\nSuch persons always have.\n\nBuck Mulligan bent across the table gravely.\n\n\u2014They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell. He will never\ncapture the Attic note. The note of Swinburne, of all poets, the white death\nand the ruddy birth. That is his tragedy. He can never be a poet. The joy of\ncreation ....\n\n\u2014Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly. I see. I tackled him this\nmorning on belief. There was something on his mind, I saw. It\u2019s rather\ninteresting because professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an interesting point out\nof that.\n\nBuck Mulligan\u2019s watchful eyes saw the waitress come. He helped her to unload\nher tray.\n\n\u2014He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth, Haines said, amid the\ncheerful cups. The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny, of\nretribution. Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea. Does he write\nanything for your movement?\n\nHe sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream. Buck\nMulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its smoking\npith. He bit off a soft piece hungrily.\n\n\u2014Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing. He is going to write something in\nten years.\n\n\u2014Seems a long way off, Haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon. Still, I\nshouldn\u2019t wonder if he did after all.\n\nHe tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup.\n\n\u2014This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance. I don\u2019t want to\nbe imposed on.\n\nElijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks of ships\nand trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new Wapping street past\nBenson\u2019s ferry, and by the threemasted schooner Rosevean from Bridgwater with\nbricks.\n\nAlmidano Artifoni walked past Holles street, past Sewell\u2019s yard. Behind him\nCashel Boyle O\u2019Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, with stickumbrelladustcoat\ndangling, shunned the lamp before Mr Law Smith\u2019s house and, crossing, walked\nalong Merrion square. Distantly behind him a blind stripling tapped his way by\nthe wall of College park.\n\nCashel Boyle O\u2019Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as Mr Lewis\nWerner\u2019s cheerful windows, then turned and strode back along Merrion square,\nhis stickumbrelladustcoat dangling.\n\nAt the corner of Wilde\u2019s house he halted, frowned at Elijah\u2019s name announced\non the Metropolitan hall, frowned at the distant pleasance of duke\u2019s lawn. His\neyeglass flashed frowning in the sun. With ratsteeth bared he muttered:\n\n\u2014Coactus volui.\n\nHe strode on for Clare street, grinding his fierce word.\n\nAs he strode past Mr Bloom\u2019s dental windows the sway of his dustcoat brushed\nrudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards, having\nbuffeted a thewless body. The blind stripling turned his sickly face after the\nstriding form.\n\n\u2014God\u2019s curse on you, he said sourly, whoever you are! You\u2019re blinder nor I am,\nyou bitch\u2019s bastard!\n\nOpposite Ruggy O\u2019Donohoe\u2019s Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, pawing the pound\nand a half of Mangan\u2019s, late Fehrenbach\u2019s, porksteaks he had been sent for,\nwent along warm Wicklow street dawdling. It was too blooming dull sitting in\nthe parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs MacDowell and the blind\ndown and they all at their sniffles and sipping sups of the superior tawny\nsherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney\u2019s. And they eating crumbs of the\ncottage fruitcake, jawing the whole blooming time and sighing.\n\nAfter Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, courtdress milliner, stopped\nhim. He stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to their pelts and\nputting up their props. From the sidemirrors two mourning Masters Dignam gaped\nsilently. Myler Keogh, Dublin\u2019s pet lamb, will meet sergeantmajor Bennett, the\nPortobello bruiser, for a purse of fifty sovereigns. Gob, that\u2019d be a good\npucking match to see. Myler Keogh, that\u2019s the chap sparring out to him with\nthe green sash. Two bar entrance, soldiers half price. I could easy do a bunk\non ma. Master Dignam on his left turned as he turned. That\u2019s me in mourning.\nWhen is it? May the twentysecond. Sure, the blooming thing is all over. He\nturned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap awry, his\ncollar sticking up. Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he saw the image of\nMarie Kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two puckers. One of them mots\nthat do be in the packets of fags Stoer smokes that his old fellow welted hell\nout of him for one time he found out.\n\nMaster Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on. The best pucker going for\nstrength was Fitzsimons. One puck in the wind from that fellow would knock you\ninto the middle of next week, man. But the best pucker for science was Jem\nCorbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of him, dodging and all.\n\nIn Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff\u2019s mouth and a swell\npair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was telling him and\ngrinning all the time.\n\nNo Sandymount tram.\n\nMaster Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to his other\nhand. His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down. The blooming stud was\ntoo small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming end to it. He met\nschoolboys with satchels. I\u2019m not going tomorrow either, stay away till\nMonday. He met other schoolboys. Do they notice I\u2019m in mourning? Uncle Barney\nsaid he\u2019d get it into the paper tonight. Then they\u2019ll all see it in the paper\nand read my name printed and pa\u2019s name.\n\nHis face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a fly\nwalking over it up to his eye. The scrunch that was when they were screwing\nthe screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were bringing it\ndownstairs.\n\nPa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling the men\nhow to get it round the bend. A big coffin it was, and high and heavylooking.\nHow was that? The last night pa was boosed he was standing on the landing\nthere bawling out for his boots to go out to Tunney\u2019s for to boose more and he\nlooked butty and short in his shirt. Never see him again. Death, that is. Pa\nis dead. My father is dead. He told me to be a good son to ma. I couldn\u2019t hear\nthe other things he said but I saw his tongue and his teeth trying to say it\nbetter. Poor pa. That was Mr Dignam, my father. I hope he\u2019s in purgatory now\nbecause he went to confession to Father Conroy on Saturday night.\n\nWilliam Humble, earl of Dudley, and lady Dudley, accompanied by\nlieutenantcolonel Heseltine, drove out after luncheon from the viceregal\nlodge. In the following carriage were the honourable Mrs Paget, Miss de Courcy\nand the honourable Gerald Ward A.D.C. in attendance.\n\nThe cavalcade passed out by the lower gate of Phoenix park saluted by\nobsequious policemen and proceeded past Kingsbridge along the northern quays.\nThe viceroy was most cordially greeted on his way through the metropolis. At\nBloody bridge Mr Thomas Kernan beyond the river greeted him vainly from afar.\nBetween Queen\u2019s and Whitworth bridges lord Dudley\u2019s viceregal carriages passed\nand were unsaluted by Mr Dudley White, B. L., M. A., who stood on Arran quay\noutside Mrs M. E. White\u2019s, the pawnbroker\u2019s, at the corner of Arran street\nwest stroking his nose with his forefinger, undecided whether he should arrive\nat Phibsborough more quickly by a triple change of tram or by hailing a car or\non foot through Smithfield, Constitution hill and Broadstone terminus. In the\nporch of Four Courts Richie Goulding with the costbag of Goulding, Collis and\nWard saw him with surprise. Past Richmond bridge at the doorstep of the office\nof Reuben J Dodd, solicitor, agent for the Patriotic Insurance Company, an\nelderly female about to enter changed her plan and retracing her steps by\nKing\u2019s windows smiled credulously on the representative of His Majesty. From\nits sluice in Wood quay wall under Tom Devan\u2019s office Poddle river hung out in\nfealty a tongue of liquid sewage. Above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel,\ngold by bronze, Miss Kennedy\u2019s head by Miss Douce\u2019s head watched and admired.\nOn Ormond quay Mr Simon Dedalus, steering his way from the greenhouse for the\nsubsheriff\u2019s office, stood still in midstreet and brought his hat low. His\nExcellency graciously returned Mr Dedalus\u2019 greeting. From Cahill\u2019s corner the\nreverend Hugh C. Love, M.A., made obeisance unperceived, mindful of lords\ndeputies whose hands benignant had held of yore rich advowsons. On Grattan\nbridge Lenehan and M\u2018Coy, taking leave of each other, watched the carriages go\nby. Passing by Roger Greene\u2019s office and Dollard\u2019s big red printinghouse Gerty\nMacDowell, carrying the Catesby\u2019s cork lino letters for her father who was\nlaid up, knew by the style it was the lord and lady lieutenant but she\ncouldn\u2019t see what Her Excellency had on because the tram and Spring\u2019s big\nyellow furniture van had to stop in front of her on account of its being the\nlord lieutenant. Beyond Lundy Foot\u2019s from the shaded door of Kavanagh\u2019s\nwinerooms John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness towards the lord\nlieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland. The Right Honourable\nWilliam Humble, earl of Dudley, G. C. V. O., passed Micky Anderson\u2019s\nalltimesticking watches and Henry and James\u2019s wax smartsuited freshcheeked\nmodels, the gentleman Henry, dernier cri James. Over against Dame gate Tom\nRochford and Nosey Flynn watched the approach of the cavalcade. Tom Rochford,\nseeing the eyes of lady Dudley fixed on him, took his thumbs quickly out of\nthe pockets of his claret waistcoat and doffed his cap to her. A charming\nsoubrette, great Marie Kendall, with dauby cheeks and lifted skirt smiled\ndaubily from her poster upon William Humble, earl of Dudley, and upon\nlieutenantcolonel H. G. Heseltine, and also upon the honourable Gerald Ward A.\nD. C. From the window of the D. B. C. Buck Mulligan gaily, and Haines gravely,\ngazed down on the viceregal equipage over the shoulders of eager guests, whose\nmass of forms darkened the chessboard whereon John Howard Parnell looked\nintently. In Fownes\u2019s street Dilly Dedalus, straining her sight upward from\nChardenal\u2019s first French primer, saw sunshades spanned and wheelspokes\nspinning in the glare. John Henry Menton, filling the doorway of Commercial\nBuildings, stared from winebig oyster eyes, holding a fat gold hunter watch\nnot looked at in his fat left hand not feeling it. Where the foreleg of King\nBilly\u2019s horse pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked her hastening husband back from\nunder the hoofs of the outriders. She shouted in his ear the tidings.\nUnderstanding, he shifted his tomes to his left breast and saluted the second\ncarriage. The honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C., agreeably surprised, made haste\nto reply. At Ponsonby\u2019s corner a jaded white flagon H. halted and four\ntallhatted white flagons halted behind him, E. L. Y\u2019S, while outriders pranced\npast and carriages. Opposite Pigott\u2019s music warerooms Mr Denis J Maginni,\nprofessor of dancing &c, gaily apparelled, gravely walked, outpassed by a\nviceroy and unobserved. By the provost\u2019s wall came jauntily Blazes Boylan,\nstepping in tan shoes and socks with skyblue clocks to the refrain of My\ngirl\u2019s a Yorkshire girl. Blazes Boylan presented to the leaders\u2019 skyblue\nfrontlets and high action a skyblue tie, a widebrimmed straw hat at a rakish\nangle and a suit of indigo serge. His hands in his jacket pockets forgot to\nsalute but he offered to the three ladies the bold admiration of his eyes and\nthe red flower between his lips. As they drove along Nassau street His\nExcellency drew the attention of his bowing consort to the programme of music\nwhich was being discoursed in College park. Unseen brazen highland laddies\nblared and drumthumped after the cort\u00e8ge:\n\nBut though she\u2019s a factory lass And wears no fancy clothes. Baraabum. Yet I\u2019ve\na sort of a Yorkshire relish for My little Yorkshire rose. Baraabum.\n\nThither of the wall the quartermile flat handicappers, M. C. Green, H. Thrift,\nT. M. Patey, C. Scaife, J. B. Jeffs, G. N. Morphy, F. Stevenson, C. Adderly\nand W. C. Huggard, started in pursuit. Striding past Finn\u2019s hotel Cashel Boyle\nO\u2019Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell stared through a fierce eyeglass across\nthe carriages at the head of Mr M. E. Solomons in the window of the Austro-\nHungarian viceconsulate. Deep in Leinster street by Trinity\u2019s postern a loyal\nking\u2019s man, Hornblower, touched his tallyho cap. As the glossy horses pranced\nby Merrion square Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, waiting, saw salutes being\ngiven to the gent with the topper and raised also his new black cap with\nfingers greased by porksteak paper. His collar too sprang up. The viceroy, on\nhis way to inaugurate the Mirus bazaar in aid of funds for Mercer\u2019s hospital,\ndrove with his following towards Lower Mount street. He passed a blind\nstripling opposite Broadbent\u2019s. In Lower Mount street a pedestrian in a brown\nmacintosh, eating dry bread, passed swiftly and unscathed across the viceroy\u2019s\npath. At the Royal Canal bridge, from his hoarding, Mr Eugene Stratton, his\nblub lips agrin, bade all comers welcome to Pembroke township. At Haddington\nroad corner two sanded women halted themselves, an umbrella and a bag in which\neleven cockles rolled to view with wonder the lord mayor and lady mayoress\nwithout his golden chain.

Both \u201c\u0444\u0430\u0431\u0443\u043b\u0430\u201d and \u201c\u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u201d can mean \u201cplot,\u201d but early\n20th century Russian critics narrowed their definitions. Fabula, in its most\nbasic sense, is the historical order of the events in a story. Sju\u017eet (from\nthe French \u201csujet\u201d) is the narrative order of the story.\n\nVery simplistically, in Ulysses, episode 3 (\u201cProteus\u201d) is after episode 4\n(\u201cCalypso\u201d) in the novel\u2019s fabula, as the events in the former take place\nstarting at 11:00 on Bloomsday, while the events in the latter cover\n8:00\u201310:00. However, \u201cProteus\u201d is before \u201cCalypso\u201d in the sju\u017eet, as it is the\nthird episode, and \u201cCalypso\u201d is the fourth. Reading Ulysses\u2019s fabula would\nforce reading episode 4 before episode 3. Reading its sju\u017eet reverses the\nprocess.\n\nAdding complication, Viktor Shklovsky builds on this distinction to\ndemonstrate how the aesthetic emerges from the material.\n\n> The concept of plot (syuzhet) is too often confused with a description of\n> the events in the novel, with what I\u2019d tentatively call the story line\n> (fabula).\n>\n> As a matter of fact, though, the story line is nothing more than material\n> for plot formation [\u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f].\n\nThe fabula is the foundation, the \u201creal world\u201d of the novel that is then bent\nand twisted into the sju\u017eet, which carries the artistic charge. As Shklovsky\ncontinues,\n\n> The forms of art are explained by the artistic laws that govern them and not\n> by comparisons with actual life. In order to impede the action of the novel,\n> the artist resorts not to witches and magic potions but to a simple\n> transposition of its parts. He thereby reveals to us the aesthetic laws that\n> underlie both of these compositional devices.\n\nThis fundamental requirement of transposition is prompted by Shklovsky\u2019s\nremarking on Tristram Shandy\u2019s own discussion of his digressions at the end of\nvolume VI of his novel. Shandy draws a set of lines to describe his\n\u201cdigressions,\u201d aiming eventually to produce a straight line, \u201cthe best line.\u201d\nBut these digressions, this manipulation of the material of the fabula, is\nwhat prompts Shklovsky to call Tristram Shandy \u201cthe most typical novel in\nworld literature\u201d (170).\n\nThe fabula (raw material) and sju\u017eet (manipulated material) generate\ncontrasting and perhaps contradictory temporalities (or, better,\nspatiotemporalities) that separate the novel from the world that the novel\ncreates. When discussing story/discourse, histoire/discours, and\nfabula/sju\u017eet, Alex Woloch reiterates this point by adding that\n\n> All these dichotomous terms refer, finally, to the essentially divided\n> nature of the literary text, as it is torn between form and content; between\n> the signified and the signifier; between the text\u2019s linguistic world\u2014words,\n> sentences, chapters\u2014and the imagined world that we grasp at through the\n> text. Discourse [sju\u017eet] points us to the narrative\u2019s actual language and\n> structure; story [fabula] to the fictional events that we reconstruct\n> through the narrative (38).\n\nThe world generated by the novel has a spacetime that interacts with the\naesthetic means by which the world is uncovered in the plot. The elements of\nthe fabula are abstracted out and exist in a spatiotemporality we could call\n\u201cgeohistory,\u201d one where time moves only in one direction. Hence the fabula of\nthe Dublin created in \u201cWandering Rocks\u201d could actually begin with the 8th Earl\nof Kildare, whose late 15th century rule of Ireland comes up in conversation\nbetween Lambert and O\u2019Molloy, as those acts are a cause whose effect (the\nconversation), bubbles up on Bloomsday. For the purposes of this\nvisualization, however, the timeline of the fabula marches in its solitary\ndirection from 14:55 to 15:58 on 16 June 1904.\n\nThe elements of the fabula, however, provide the foundation for the sju\u017eet.\nHere, the building blocks of the novel world\u2019s geohistory are recombined with\naesthetics in mind. Within the sju\u017eet, the fabula is reordered, and the\ntimeline is no longer a persistent march forward.\n\nThough Ulysses moves linearly for the most part (save the clock\u2019s resetting at\nthe beginning of \u201cCalypso\u201d as noted above), in \u201cWandering Rocks,\u201d it\u2019s clear\nhow different fabula and sju\u017eet can be. Because of Joyce\u2019s meticulous design\nfor the chapter, we can see it as a network of crisscrossing timelines. The\nfirst moment in the episode is the same in both fabula and sju\u017eet; Conmee\nchecks his watch. Similarly, the last is the same in both as well; Artifoni\nfinally catches a Dalkey tram just as the viceregal cavalcade passes him by.\nBut these events bookend something that jumps back and forth, underscoring the\ndifferent modes of spatiotemporality offered by fabula and sju\u017eet. Yet because\nof the necessary temporal component of spatiotemporality, it doesn\u2019t suffice\nto think of \u201cWandering Rocks\u201d with a fixed map showing everyone\u2019s journeys.\nThe information is incomplete.\n\nFurthermore, \u201cWandering Rocks\u201d\u2019s focus on minor characters also highlights the\ntension between the world of the novel (where the fabula is) and its art\n(where the sju\u017eet is). The episode takes the reader out of the frame of The\nOdyssey, of the story of Stephen and Bloom. Instead, it showcases Dublin and\nits inhabitants, a side story populated by masses of minor characters not\ntypically given the space to breathe in a novel.\n\n## Wandering Rocks\n\n\u201cWandering Rocks\u201d is the most obviously complexly, mechanically intertwined\nepisode in James Joyce\u2019s 1992 novel Ulysses. It also stands outside of the\nrest of the novel in its use of spatiotemporality, focus on secondary\ncharacters, and lack of an analogue in The Odyssey.\n\nUlysses, after all, has structural similarities to The Odyssey, but in the\nlatter, Odysseus is only told about the danger of sailing through the\nWandering Rocks. He takes his chances, instead, with Scylla and Charybdis. As\na result, the episode provides Joyce a bit of space in which to play outside\nthe frame of the rest of the novel, which is, of course, already a very\nforgiving frame.\n\nRichard Ellmann notes that the episode brings \u201cthe city of Dublin even more\nfully into the book by focusing upon it rather than upon Bloom or Stephen,\u201d\nthe two main characters of the novel (452). In its difference from the rest of\nthe novel on these terms, it also reflects back on the rest of the novel.\nStuart Gilbert adds, \u201cIn its structure and its technic (\u2018labyrinth\u2019) this\nepisode may be regarded as a small-scale model of Ulysses as a whole\u201d (227).\n\nAs a novel-within-a-novel, then, the episode is broken up into 19 distinct\nsections. Each centers around, more or less, a different character. Some move\naround, with the greatest distance covered in the first and last sections. But\nother characters remain in one place during the course of their section.\nFurthermore, each section except the last features at least one \u201cintrusion,\u201d\nwhich acts like a jump cut taking us to another location but at the same time.\nBecause the intrusions typically refer to characters who show up elsewhere in\nthe episode, it becomes possible to plot out a timeline of events, which is\nwhat this visualization does. We know person x was at place n to meet person\ny, but over at m later to meet person z. But through the intrusions, we also\nknow where y and z were at the same time, though separate from one another.\nThese collisions are nowhere clearer than in the final section, which features\na viceregal cavalcade riding from Phoenix Park to the Mirus Bazaar in\nBallsbridge, thereby riding straight through downtown Dublin, where nearly\nevery character in the episode has an opportunity to remark on the cavalcade\nas it rides past.\n\nThe text used in this visualization, with all the attendant caveats, is the\n1986 edition edited by Hans Walter Gabler.\n\nA brief description of each of the 19 episodes:\n\n  1. Father Conmee walks from his church to Artane, taking the tram for a part of his trip.\n\n  2. Corny Kelleher tends to a coffin and speaks to a constable.\n\n  3. A onelegged sailor walks to Eccles Street, where he is given money including a coin tossed by Molly Bloom from her window.\n\n  4. Katey and Boody Dedalus arrive home. Maggy offers them soup.\n\n  5. Blazes Boylan orders a package at Thornton\u2019s to be sent to Molly and leers at the shopgirl.\n\n  6. Stephen Dedalus and Almidano Artifoni talk by Trinity College. Artifoni misses his tram.\n\n  7. Miss Dunne does some work and gets a phone call from Boylan.\n\n  8. Ned Lambert gives a tour of the council chamber of St. Mary\u2019s Abbey to Hugh Love. J. J. O\u2019Malloy accompanies.\n\n  9. Lenehan and M\u2018Coy walk from Crampton Court to Temple Bar to the Liffey. Lenehan tells a story about groping Molly.\n\n  10. Leopold Bloom decides which books to buy for Molly.\n\n  11. Dilly Dedalus runs into Simon Dedalus and asks him for money.\n\n  12. Tom Kernan walks from completing a business deal to the Liffey where he just misses the cavalcade.\n\n  13. Stephen looks over some books and runs into Dilly, who has bought a French primer.\n\n  14. Simon, Father Cowley, and Ben Dollard walk along the Liffey toward the Ormond Hotel.\n\n  15. Martin Cunningham, Jack Power, John Wyse Nolan, and Jimmy Henry walk from Dublin Castle to Kavanagh\u2019s winerooms.\n\n  16. Buck Mulligan and Haines order m\u00e9langes at D. B. C. while John Howard Parnell plays chess.\n\n  17. Artifoni still chases his tram, while Cashel Boyle O\u2019Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walks along Merrion Square.\n\n  18. Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam starts to bring porksteaks back home.\n\n  19. The viceregal cavalcade leaves Phoenix Park and drives through downtown Dublin on the way to the Mirus Bazaar.\n\n## Spacetime, Nothing but Spacetime...\n\n> Did it start with Bergson, or before? Space was treated as the dead, the\n> fixed, the undialectical, the immobile. Time, on the contrary, was richness,\n> fecundity, life, dialectic (Foucault 70).\n\nThe relationship between space, spacetime, and the novel has been at the\ncenter of my work for almost a decade now. And still I often start with this\nmaybe throwaway quote by Michel Foucault from an interview that seems often\ncited instead for its final kicker, \u201cGeography must indeed necessarily lie at\nthe heart of my concerns\u201d (77). But the solution to geography\u2019s second-class\nstatus compared to time isn\u2019t solved by doubling down on geography, unless\nthat is done just to bring geography up to the same speed as time.\n\nIn literary study, we have a nearly century-old model for thinking literature\nspatiotemporally (as opposed to just temporally or, in a more postmodern,\nJamesonian vein, just spatially). Mikhail Bakhtin defines the chronotope as\nthat which demonstrates the \u201cintrinsic connectedness of temporal and spatial\nrelationships that are artistically expressed in literature.\u201d Based on Albert\nEinstein\u2019s Theory of Relativity, the chronotope \u201cexpresses the inseparability\nof space and time\u201d (84). Many critical geographers (Doreen Massey, Edward\nSoja, David Harvey) have insisted on merging the two for decades now, but\ndoing so continues to present challenges to literary study, at least when\nthinking about the worlds a novel creates.\n\nAuthors of aesthetic texts have followed Aristotle\u2019s command that a work have\na beginning, middle, and end for over two millennia. There is, then, an\nintrinsic temporality provided merely by how we consume the text. Even edge\ncases like Choose your Own Adventures or Rayuela still provide a linearity on\nthe fly rendered temporally. A sju\u017eet remains; it\u2019s just more reader-driven\nand divorced from the increment variable we typically call \u201cpage number.\u201d\n\nRoland Barthes writes that \u201cfor those of us who are trying to establish a\nplural... the reading must also be plural, that is, without order of\nentrance.\u201d Reaching this height of plurality or writerliness is a summit that\nI\u2019m still trying to work through, but I think that a good way in is precisely\nthrough the multiple spatiotemporalities present in any (?) novel, at least.\nBarthes\u2019s encouragement to read \u201cthe text as if it had already been read,\u201d\nwhich helps to manhandle and interrupt the text, trips up the dominance on a\ntemporal-only kind of thinking, which both allows for space to catch up and\njoin its dimensional sibling but also allows the reader to see that there is\nnot just one time\u2014or one spacetime\u2014in a novel (15).\n\nFocussing on the competing, colliding, contradicting, and circumventing\nspatiotemporalities in \u201cWandering Rocks\u201d actually helps shattered the text,\nwith what feels like literally hundreds of obvious points of entry providing\nanother rereading, another time through, another production.\n\nNo matter what I\u2019ve called the spatiotemporalities in novels before (\u201csites,\u201d\n\u201c\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0447\u0438\u0435\u201d and \u201c\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c,\u201d and so on), as I try to build out my idea of\n\u201ceveryday criticism,\u201d any kind of working over a text that allows these\nvariable points of entry and variable productions, these writings by readers,\nprovide yet newer means of pushing the plurality.\n\n## Data\n\nThere are three distinct datasets in this project, and all of them rely on the\nprevious work done by Don Gifford and Ian Gunn and Clive Hart.\n\nThe data in the first dataset are what I call \u201cinstances.\u201d These are instances\nof a place\u2019s being mentioned in the text. I wrote a web application, NYWalker,\nthat makes it easier to add these instances by hand. They include a page\nnumber, a sequence, and a specific location. To this data, I also added times,\nusing Hart\u2019s measurements. Hart did not time each instance of a place\u2019s being\nmentioned, so I guessed a time for a lot of them. The dataset is further split\ninto two explicit spatiotemporalities, in that there is an \u201cexterior\u201d\nspacetime (where actors are) and an \u201cinterior\u201d spacetime (on what actors or\nthe narrator remark). These distinctions are local to this visualization and\nare not part of the NYWalker data, which is available for download.\n\nThe second dataset is built on the first. It includes \u201ccollisions.\u201d These are\nincidents that clearly take place at a specific place and time and feature\nmultiple actors but may not be explicitly noted in the text with an \u201cinstance\u201d\n(though a nearby instance often provides a clue for location and time!). An\ninstance is Conmee\u2019s boarding a tram on Newcomen Bridge. A collision is\nConmee\u2019s (actor 1) looking at the awkward man (actor 2) while on the tram.\n\nThe third dataset is mostly invisible at this time. It is made up of the paths\ntaken by around 30 different actors in the episode. Currently, only two are\nvisible: Conmee\u2019s and the cavalcade\u2019s. These two are available because,\napparently, Joyce relied on them in constructing the mechanics of the episode.\nI drew all of the paths by hand and most rely on a lot of speculation, such as\nhow someone walks from O\u2019Connell Bridge to \u201cKing Billy\u2019s horse\u201d on College\nGreen. The narrator does not tell us, after all, how the Breens took the trip.\n\nThere are several famous geographical \u201cblunders\u201d in the episode, where the\nnarrator (or a character) misidentifies a place. Three deserve special\ncomment. important here. First, the Poddle river acts as an actor and not a\nplace. This permits its \u201cmisplacing\u201d by the Wood Quay with no worry. Next,\nFarrell confuses the Merrion Hall with the Metropolitan Hall. Finally,\nStratton\u2019s image welcomes the cavalcade on a bridge spanning the Grand Canal\nthat is referred to as the \u201cRoyal Canal Bridge.\u201d In both later instances, I\ntreated these as misidentifications, not as references to places far removed\nfrom the spatiotemporal logic of either actor\u2019s location and movement.\n\nIn one last detail, Gifford writes that Thomas Court, the location of the\nunfindable \u201cmansion of the Kildares\u201d that Love mentions, \u201cwas the main street\nof the walled city of medieval Dublin. It is at present a series of streets\nincluding Thomas Street\u201d (268). I read the reference as one to, instead, the\nLiberty of Thomas Court and Donore, a manor right outside the walled city and\nthe location of the current Dublin street Thomas Court.\n\n## Technology\n\nThis project is available on GitHub.\n\nThe scholarly incentive for the project was to think about wandering in the\ncity (for a completely unrelated project), but a secondary incentive was to\nget to know a few technologies better, namely Leaflet and D3. Along the way,\nmy familiarity with JavaScript and especially jQuery also improved.\n\nThe text in these various tabs was written in Markdown and is converted to\nHTML on the fly by Showdown. The overall aesthetic is farmed out to Bootstrap,\nwhich is extended with the Bootstrap Toggle extension to make the handsome\nswitches. The colorscheme on the map, of course, is from Color Brewer 2.0.\n\nIf the project looks a lot like Chris Whong\u2019s NYC Taxis: A Day in the Life\nvisualization, that\u2019s not a coincidence. The project proved to me that it was\npossible to do a time animation usefully using a combination of D3 and Leaflet\n(in fact, I found it by just googling \u201cd3 Leaflet animation\u201d and clicking\nthrough the link on Zev Ross\u2019s top Google hit). Mike Bostock\u2019s OG \u201cD3 +\nLeaflet\u201d demo describes how the various dots and paths are converted from\nGeoJSON to SVG objects.\n\nI also consulted two books rather extensively. Scott Murray\u2019s Interactive Data\nVisualization for the Web is a great introduction to how weird D3 is. Once I\nread and understood everything in that volume, Elijah Meeks\u2019s D3.js in Action\nserved as handy secondary resource. Both books could use updates, I feel,\nincluding sections about, among other things, something like Leaflet. Meeks\u2019s\nchapter on geospatial information visualization, for example, rather\nstartlingly answered very few of my questions, largely because of the\ndifficulty I encountered using d3.geoPath with Leaflet instead of creating a\nsui generis map where I provide even the basemap/shapes (see below).\n\nOf course, I also used StackOverflow extensively, but that goes without\nsaying.\n\n### Let\u2019s get technical...\n\nFor those seeking to emulate this project, by far and away the most\ncomplicated aspect for me is/was figuring out how to control what a Point\nGeoJSON object would look like using the d3.geoPath generator. It doesn\u2019t draw\na simple <circle> SVG object, but, rather, creates a circle in the SVG <path>\nminilanguage (visible under attribute d). Hence, the points don\u2019t respond to\nthe usual changes in the r attribute like one might expect (or like every D3\ntutorial expects).\n\nThis mostly became an issue because there are two maps in this visualization,\nmeaning two different d3.geoTransforms and d3.geoProjections. I rewrote the\nwhole project using <circle>s with on-the-fly conversions for each, but it\nslowed the site down. Bostock\u2019s example, in contrast, streams points, which\nis, if I understand correctly, asynchronous and much faster. So I had to stick\nto d3.geoPaths and figure out how to manipulate d.\n\nActually, this video from DashingD3js, despite its hilariously dull\nrepetition, was what finally made me understand what was going on with the\npath and why changing the r attribute wasn\u2019t doing anything!\n\n### To Come...\n\nI had hoped to have animated paths like in the NYC Taxi visualization above.\nWhong has it kind of easy in this case, because the path is pre-defined (or at\nleast built w/ an api call), there\u2019s a start point, an end point, and a\nduration. The animation is made up of only one piece, then\u2014that specific trip\nfrom A to B. Here, rather, I have paths covered by people where they have to\nbe in many different, specific places at many different, specific times.\nThat\u2019s a big project of splitting up the paths in the data I am not quite yet\nready to do. Building up the other datasets was enough work for now. But in\nthe future, however, I\u2019d love a little horse emoji representing the Cavalcade\nas it rides to the Bazaar, say.\n\n## This Is Great and All, but So What?\n\n> My task is to move, to shift systems (Barthes 10).\n\nThis is the hardest tab to write. Building this visualization involves\n(involved) giving in to tendencies that I am trying to avoid in my\nscholarship. Given that one of the goals was to learn the\nvisualization/animation technology, however, it could not have been otherwise.\n\nDo these animations, despite being highly neat, actually tell us much about\n\u201cWandering Rocks\u201d? I think the answer is yes, but perhaps not for the what\nmight seem obvious reasons. I give below a few conversations between my inner\nhater and myself, conversations that I think provide insight into the massive\nand potentially unforeseen problems this kind of digital work creates. Again,\nthese much more complicated than what one might expect to be initial responses\nfrom digital skeptics. Those \u201cOK, So?\u201ds tend to be much easier to parry.\n\nGreat, just what the world needs, another deep dive on James Freakin\u2019 Joyce.\nThere are lots of novels with fractured fabuly and sju\u017eety. Similarly, there\nare lots of novels that provide extensive geographical detail, making mapping\nmovements through a city possible. Why go back to such a canonical novel like\nUlysses? Well, its very canonicity means that a lot of the work has already\nbeen done. Most of the geocoding for this section was just double-checking\ngeolocations already performed by Don Gifford and Ian Gunn and Clive Hart.\nAdditionally, the timings would have been impossible for me to include without\nHart\u2019s own walking around in Dublin pretending to be an old woman or onelegged\nsailor, stopwatch in hand.\n\nGenerally, I aim to make spatiotemporal investigations of many different kinds\nof novels\u2014not just simply obvious hits like The Novel of High Modernism. Yet\nsometimes it\u2019s worthwhile to build on a strong, already existing foundation of\nscholarship and interest. For example, the geographical \u201cblunders\u201d in the\nepisode have already been dissected by generations of Joyce scholars, meaning\nwhen I stumbled upon them independently, I could rely on those scholars\u2019\nexpertise and either accept that confidently or give reasons for rejecting it.\nThe novel\u2019s canonicity and popularity helps boost this project\u2019s profile, I\nhope. I think the ideas and troubles hinted at in how I talk about this\nproject are important to any scholars interested in digital scholarship that\nframes spatiotemoporality for any novel (or perhaps any aesthetic text).\nBecause a lot of people care about Joyce, perhaps this specific visualization\nwill give those ideas more visibility.\n\nFriend, Ulysses takes place in Dublin in 1904. You have a 2017 basemap. This\nis a valid concern, but perhaps not as valid as it is clever. And it is\ncertainly one that merely putting a c. 1904 georectified basemap underneath\nthe dots and lines would not solve. Johanna Drucker encourages data-handling\nhumanists to reconsider the value of georectification, especially with\nhistorical maps, because the process merely \u201creconciles spatial data and\nmaps... with a given standard, such as Google maps\u201d (76\u201377). Georectification\nis the imposition of a specific, GIS kind of thinking on data (or \u201ccapta,\u201d to\nuse Drucker\u2019s term) that were not generated with GIS in mind. Drucker instead\nissues the following challenge: \u201cthe greater intellectual challenge is to\ncreate spatial representations without referencing a pre-existing ground,\u201d\nwhich I think anyone in my position should always keep in mind (77).\n\nThe information within \u201cWandering Rocks\u201d takes a troubling trip to your\ncomputer screen: I capture a chunk and identify it as a datum (or captum). I\nthen spatiotemporally locate it through consulting some combination of\nGifford, Gunn and Hart, Wikipedia, and Google. Following a conversion, perhaps\nwith Google\u2019s help, to Cartesian coordinates based on a measurement of the\nEarth\u2019s shape from 1984, I line those coordinates up with a contemporary map\nof Dublin, making the risky guess that, as far as downtown is concerned,\nstreets have not changed their shape all that much. Then Leaflet and D3, two\nsoftware packages, combine to recalculate those coordinates into coordinates\non an SVG plane that you see as little exploding dots. Every step adds new\nassumptions about how space and time work and move the capta further from\ntheir source. Furthermore, as soon as the jump is made to the digital, a faux-\nprecision emerges, where, for example, something like the immense idea of\n\u201cAmerica\u201d is reduced to a teeny exploding dot with its center in Kansas. These\nissues remain unsolved, and this project fails Drucker\u2019s challenge. But adding\na georectified historical map would be an even bigger blunder\u2014an attempt to\nfix these problems that probably actually doesn\u2019t.\n\nYou took pre\u00ebxisting information and just added color and made it bounce.\nDrucker distinguishes between information visualizations that produce the\nknowledge they draw and those that merely display information (3). It seems at\nfirst inarguable that this visualization does only the latter. Any new\ninsights into \u201cWandering Rocks\u201d seem destined to evoke the small surprise of\nthe merely interesting: \u201csurprising\u2014but not that surprising\u201d (Ngai 145). We\nget, then, the delayed, automatic judgment of \u201cisn\u2019t it interesting that\nBoylan\u2019s section is the first to intrude on Conmee\u2019s command of the fabula\nfrom the of the episode?\u201d It strikes me that moving that glimmer of\ninterestingness somewhere else requires a deeper look. Or perhaps more\nrereading.\n\nAs far as deeper looks are concerned, I have an idea for a different form of\nvisualizing the tension between fabula and sju\u017eet (hint: a two-dimentional\n(time|plot)line); that visualization, however, would be exclusively temporal,\nthereby violating the canonical rule of spatiotemporal thinking, in a Bill\nMurray singing voice: \u201cSpacetime, nothing but spacetime.\u201d The progress\nexplicit in any fabula or sju\u017eet lures us into thinking of them as strictly\ntemporal terms\u2014did it start with Bergson?\u2014and it\u2019s all too easy to treat them\nexclusively as such. But we have to avoid that.\n\nStill, on the other hand, the aesthetic of the merely interesting does have\n\u201cthe capacity to produce new knowledge\u201d (Ngai 171). Maybe there\u2019s a way\nthrough below.\n\nOK, but this all still boils down to being just a chance to play with\nJavaScript, no? Play! Isn\u2019t that the point? Roland Barthes again:\n\n> Rereading draws the text out of its internal chronology (\u201cthis happens\n> before or after that\u201d) and recaptures a mythic time (without before or\n> after); rereading is no longer consumption, but play (that play which is the\n> return of the different). If then, a deliberate contradiction in terms, we\n> immediately reread the text, it is in order to obtain, as though under the\n> effect of a drug (that of recommencement, of different), not the real text,\n> but a plural text: the same and new (16).\n\nThat sense of \u201cmythic time\u201d is especially appealing to me here. One way to\nread it would be to think of it as erasing time from the picture into the\n\u201cMessianic time, a simultaneity of past and future in an instantaneous\npresent\u201d (Anderson 24). For Benedict Anderson, however, this time is replaced\nby the Benjaminian \u201chomogenous, empty time\u201d that is \u201cmeasured by clock and\ncalendar\u201d (Anderson 24; Benjamin 264). This new, empty time (and space),\nrelies on external frames of reference (the one time, the one space) and is,\nof course, explicitly tied to the rise of the novel (Watt 21\u201327).\n\nInstead, to me, that \u201cwithout before or after\u201d signals that there is no one\nspatiotemporality in the text. The emptiness of the framing, homogenized time,\nis challenged by \u201cWandering Rocks\u201d on its own. That challenge becomes more\nacute through the play of this visualization, which relies on\u2014yet undoes\u2014the\ncentrality of a ticking clock to the episode. Clocks and their mechanicity\nare, of course, vital to \u201cWandering Rocks.\u201d Frank Budgen calls Joyce an\n\u201cengineer\u201d in plotting the episode, and Stuart Gilbert focuses on the ticks\nand tocks of the clocks and other \u201creferences to mechanical movement\u201d\nscattered throughout the episode (Budgen 123; Gilbert 234). The episode\nbegins, after all, with Conmee\u2019s checking his own watch and seeing that he has\nenough time to get to Artane. But then it closes with Artifoni finally\ncatching a tram and boarding it, such that the last moment of the episode\nprovides the breath catching pause of just-in-timeness (in contrast to\nHitchcock\u2019s being out of time in missing his bus at the start of North by\nNorthwest) that suggests that the framing clock is not enough.\n\nConmee\u2019s leisurely having all the time in the world is a promise made by the\nregulating ticks of a clock outside the frame. But the text reveals it to be\nan empty promise. Gilbert describes how the sections of \u201cWandering Rocks\u201d\n\u201cinterlock like a system of cog-wheels or the linked segments of an endless\nchain [that] may be described as \u2018mechanical\u2019,\u201d but that system of cog-wheels\nbreaks down throughout for the characters inhabiting the world in Ulysses\n(235). Kernan, the Ulsterman probably most excited to see the cavalcade, just\nmisses it. Master Dignam misses by several weeks the boxing match he\u2019d just\nfound out about. And for all the just-in-time success of the tram\u2019s closing\nits door right behind Artifoni, he has still been chasing it or its follower\nfor about five kilometers, having missed it at College Green and not boarded\nat Merrion Square. Considering this, the fabula is no longer a meticulous\nmachine moving like clockwork, and Budgen and Gilbert\u2019s insisting on putting\nJoyce central to the episode recasts the author not as expert machine builder\nor systems designer but as, instead, a mischievous puppeteer, the deus\npersistently torturing these minor characters by letting the machine tick past\nthem. Joyce cackles with enjoyment over the delays, the misses.\n\nThis visualization is not about Joyce\u2019s omnipotence rendered wicked, however.\nIt is about the spatiotemporalities within \u201cWandering Rocks.\u201d The sju\u017eet\u2019s\nrecombinating of the fabula already confounds the time \u201cmeasured by clock and\ncalendar,\u201d because now time is measured alongside lines of prose alongside\ndistance. Flipping back to the fabula causes a new rereading. Stepping forward\nand backward another. Clicking on dots another. The text is always the same,\nbut now it is plural. New. Interesting? Maybe even more.\n\n## Further Reading\n\n### Online resources and inspiration\n\n  * Bostock, Mike. \u201cD3 + Leaflet.\u201d The canonical D3 demo with Leaflet.\n\n  * DashingD3js. \u201cD3 Geo Path.\u201d A tedious and repetitive video that finally made me understand d3.geoPath.\n\n  * Forster, Chris. \u201cOn Joyce\u2019s \u2018Wandering Rocks\u2019 & Simultaneity.\u201d Forster includes two visualizations, but sadly the commenter\u2019s links to an animated visualization have rotted.\n\n  * Gunn, Ian, and Mark Wright. \u201cO, Rocks! she said.

The color of the dots and highlights\nare coordinated with this legend:\n\nExterior refers to places that characters happen upon in the episode. They are\nall in Dublin. Interior refers to places that either characters or the\nnarrator mentions, but aren\u2019t places at which the characters are at the time.\nThey are in Dublin, Ireland more generally, and even other places. \u201cInterior\u201d\nis like \u201cinterior monologue.\u201d Finally, Collisions are moments when two\nentities (a character and another character, or a book, or a smell) interact.\n\nClicking on a dot or a place in the text will pause the animation and reset it\nfrom that point. The dots are petulant, however. Once they\u2019re not the center\nof attention, they no longer respond to clicks. The text is always more\nforgiving. Of course, hitting the step-back button can revive dots that have\nalready faded away.\n\n### And the timeline-looking thing?\n\nAt the top is a visualization of the whole episode at once. When in \u201cFabula\u201d\nmode, it shows the events distributed among the 19 sections, in narrative\norder. When in \u201cSju\u017eet\u201d mode, it shows all of the events in chronological\norder. A little line jumps around to show where in the plotline or timeline\none is at any given moment. In other words, the line always shows the opposite\nmode of the main mode for the rest of the visualization. It does not respond\nto clicks.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
