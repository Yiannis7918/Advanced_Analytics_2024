Attempts to redevelop the area gained ground under Mayor\nMichael Bloomberg but eventually faltered before being reinvigorated with the\ninclusion of a soccer stadium. The new plan also includes a public school for\n650 students and a 250-room hotel.\n\nJennifer O\u2019Sullivan, the chief operating officer for the New York City\nFootball Club, noted that the 25,000-seat, $780 million stadium would be\nprivately financed and \u201c100% union-built,\u201d and said the plan is for it to open\nin time for the 2027 season.\n\nA sign welcomes development at Willets Points, Queens.\n\nArun Venugopal / Gothamist\n\n\u201cWith a World Cup coming to New York in 2026, you start to see that this is an\nopportunity to build New York as one of the soccer capitals of the world,\u201d\nO\u2019Sullivan said in an interview after the vote.\n\nQueens Councilmember Shekar Krishnan cast the sole dissenting vote. He noted\nthat the NYCFC\u2019s majority owner, Sheikh Mansour, is \u201cone of the wealthiest men\non the planet\u201d and that the redevelopment deal would allow the team to avoid\npaying property taxes.\n\nThe city\u2019s Independent Budget Office estimated the arrangement would cost\ntaxpayers $516 million in property tax revenue over the course of the\nstadium\u2019s 49-year lease.\n\n\u201cThis is a bad deal for New York City,\u201d Krishnan said. \u201cAnd this is a terrible\nprecedent for land use. A stadium on public land, subsidized by hundreds of\nmillions in public funds, is not a good deal.\u201d\n\nCity officials have rejected the budget office's assessment, arguing that it\ndidn\u2019t take into account the $6.1 billion in projected economic activity or\n14,200 construction jobs.\n\nPhoto from Willets Point as seen between 2018 and 2020. The \"urbanized\nwetlands are now gone, totally razed in Fall 2022,\" according to Cody\nHerrmann, Community Board 7 member.\n\nCourtesy of Cody Herrmann\n\nLocal environmentalists have also criticized the redevelopment proposal, and\nnoted that the area is home to wetlands and could present new residents with\nsignificant challenges in the face of climate change.\n\nCody Herrmann, an artist, environmentalist and member of Community Board 7,\nsaid the city is making a mistake by placing \u201cmarginalized people\u201d in\nthousands of affordable housing units in \u201csuch a vulnerable place.\u201d\n\nHowever, the community board's members overwhelmingly voted in favor of the\nproject, as did Queens Borough President Donovan Richards. Many supporters\nhave pointed to the city\u2019s housing crisis as driving the need for the\nredevelopment plan.\n\nThe project would bring \u201cdesperately needed homes for families and seniors\nthat will stand for generations,\u201d Jeff Blau, the CEO of the Related Companies,\nand Scott Wilpon, a partner at Sterling Equities, said in a joint statement.\nThe two companies formed a joint venture, Queens Development Group, which will\noversee much of the redevelopment.\n\n\u201cWe are going to have a neighborhood in a place that was once a maze of\nunpaved roads featuring the city\u2019s first soccer-specific stadium,\u201d the\nstatement said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to finally have a community.\u201d\n\nTagged\n\nhousing\n\neconomy\n\nqueens\n\nRace And Justice Unit\n\nPolitics\n\nArun Venugopal\n\nArun Venugopal is a senior reporter for the WNYC and Gothamist Race & Justice\nUnit who focuses on issues of race and bias in our region.
