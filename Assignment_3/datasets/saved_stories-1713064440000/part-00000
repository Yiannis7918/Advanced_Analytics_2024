Relevant\ndiscussion may be found on the talk page. Please help improve this article by\nintroducing citations to additional sources. Find sources: \"Triple fault\" \u2013\nnews \u00b7 newspapers \u00b7 books \u00b7 scholar \u00b7 JSTOR (May 2012)  \n---  \n  \nOn the x86 computer architecture, a triple fault is a special kind of\nexception generated by the CPU when an exception occurs while the CPU is\ntrying to invoke the double fault exception handler, which itself handles\nexceptions occurring while trying to invoke a regular exception handler.\n\nx86 processors beginning with the 80286 will cause a shutdown cycle to occur\nwhen a triple fault is encountered. This typically causes the motherboard\nhardware to initiate a CPU reset, which, in turn, causes the whole computer to\nreboot.^[1]^[2]\n\n## Possible causes of triple faults[edit]\n\nTriple faults indicate a problem with the operating system kernel or device\ndrivers. In modern operating systems, a triple fault is typically caused by a\nbuffer overflow or underflow in a device driver which writes over the\ninterrupt descriptor table (IDT). If the IDT is corrupted, when the next\ninterrupt happens, the processor will be unable to call either the needed\ninterrupt handler or the double fault handler because the descriptors in the\nIDT are corrupted.^[citation needed]\n\n## Virtual machines[edit]\n\nIn QEMU, a triple fault produces a dump of the virtual machine in the console,\nwith the instruction pointer set to the instruction that triggered the first\nexception.\n\nIn VirtualBox, a triple fault causes a Guru Meditation error to be displayed\nto the user. A virtual machine in this state has most features disabled and\ncannot be restarted. If the VirtualBox Debugger is open, a message is printed\nindicating a Triple fault has occurred, followed by a register dump and\ndisassembly of the last instruction executed, similar to the output of the rg\ndebugger command.\n\nWhen using Intel VT-x, a triple fault causes a VM exit, with exit reason 2.\nThe exit reason is saved to the VMCS and may be handled by the VMM software.\n\n## Other uses[edit]\n\nThe Intel 80286 processor was the first x86 processor to introduce the now-\nubiquitous protected mode. However, the 286 could not revert to the basic\n8086-compatible \"real mode\" without resetting the processor, which can only be\ndone using hardware external to the CPU. On the IBM AT and compatibles, the\ndocumented method of doing this was to use a special function on the Intel\n8042 keyboard controller, which would assert the RESET pin of the processor.\nHowever, intentionally triple-faulting the CPU was found to cause the\ntransition to occur much faster (800 microseconds instead of 15+ milliseconds)\nand more cleanly, permitting multitasking operating systems to switch back and\nforth at high speed.^[3]\n\nSome operating system kernels, such as Linux, still use triple faults as a\nlast effort in their rebooting process if an ACPI reboot fails. This is done\nby setting the IDT register to 0 and then issuing an interrupt.^[1] Since the\ntable now has length 0, all attempts to access it fail and the processor\ngenerates a triple fault.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b Collins, Robert (2000). \"Triple Faulting the CPU\".
