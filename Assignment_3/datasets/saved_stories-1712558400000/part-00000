This\n\"democratisation\" of content creation is pitched as The Great Promise to\nempower voices previously unheard. But democratisation is, arguably, a\nmisnomer. It suggests an egalitarian shift in the power dynamics of content\ncreation, purportedly enabling a more diverse range of voices to be heard.\nThis perspective - at best, blindly idealistic and, at worst, cynically\nmanipulative - fails to acknowledge the underlying complexities and potential\npitfalls of an AI-dominated internet.\n\nIt assumes equal access to and understanding of these technologies across\ndifferent demographics, which is far from reality. The digital divide remains\na significant barrier, preventing equitable access to these tools. The control\nand development of these AI technologies are concentrated in a few major\ncorporations and institutions, leading (inevitably) to gatekeeping, bias, and\nthe commercialisation of information.\n\nThe indiscriminate proliferation of AI-generated content will not empower the\nunderrepresented or democratise knowledge creation. Instead, it will further\ndilute and fragment the authenticity and reliability of information available\nto the public.\n\nThe AI glut significantly exacerbates the issue of misinformation and low-\nquality content. The current state of AI technology lacks the nuanced\nunderstanding and ethical judgment necessary to ensure the accuracy and\nintegrity of the content it produces. This gap in capability opens the\nfloodgates for misinformation to spread unchecked, fracturing discourse,\nheightening divides and hampering decision-making.\n\nThis all boils down to one thing. Human curation is now more critical than\never. As algorithms churn out vast quantities of information with varying\ndegrees of accuracy and quality, the discerning judgment of human curators is\nthe only defence against the tide of misinformation and mediocrity. Human\ncurators bring nuanced understanding, contextual awareness, and ethical\njudgment to the table\u2014qualities that AI, in its current state, is\nfundamentally unable to replicate.\n\nHuman curators can distinguish between nuanced arguments, recognise cultural\nsubtleties, and evaluate the credibility of sources in ways that algorithms\ncannot. This human touch is essential for maintaining the integrity of our\ninformation ecosystem. It serves not only as a filter for quality but also as\na signal for meaningful and trustworthy content amidst the overwhelming noise\ngenerated by AI systems.\n\nThe role of human curators is not just to select and present content but to\nimbue the digital landscape with a sense of reliability and authenticity that\nonly human insight can provide. In an age where technology can easily mislead\nor overwhelm, trusting in human curation becomes not a preference but a\nnecessity for preserving the quality of the information that shapes our\nunderstanding of the world.\n\nAcross the Fediverse and beyond, respected voices are leveraging platforms\nlike Mastodon and their websites to share personally vetted links, analysis,\nand creations following the POSSE model - Publish on your Own Site, Syndicate\nElsewhere. By passing high-quality, human-centric content through their own\nlens of discernment before syndicating it to social networks, these curators\ncreate islands of sanity amidst oceans of machine-generated content of\nquestionable provenance. Their followers, in turn, further syndicate these\nnuggets of insight across the social web, providing an alternative to\ncentralised, algorithmically boosted feeds.\n\nThis distributed, decentralised model follows the architecture of the web\nitself - networks within networks, sites linking out to others based on trust\nand perceived authority. It\u2019s a rethinking of information democracy around\nengaged participation and critical thinking from readers, not just content\ngeneration alone from so-called \"influencers\" boosted by profit-driven\nbehemoths. We are all responsible for carefully stewarding our attention and\nthe content we amplify via shares and recommendations. With more voices comes\nmore noise - but also more opportunity to find signals of truth if we empower\ndiscernment.\n\nThis POSSE model interfaces beautifully with RSS, enabling subscribers to\nfollow websites, blogs and podcasts they trust via open standard feeds\ncompletely uncensored by any central platform. RSS has been largely forgotten\nin the age of the social media firehose, but it provides a critical off-ramp\nfrom algorithmic feeds within walled gardens. It returns agency to readers in\ndetermining their own information diet while giving creators direct\nrelationships with their audience rather than being mediated through third-\nparty networks.\n\nRSS enables what technology essayist Venkatesh Rao calls \"commonsism\" -\nthrough simple chronological updates from websites with full article text\nincluded that let readers again own their own attention journey. With RSS, the\ncontent stream becomes democratic again, with each person curating their feed\nfrom diverse sites rather than submitting it to centralised gatekeepers. This\nis a rethinking of information democracy as grounded in context - trusting\nreaders to determine their information intake aligned with their interests and\nvalues.\n\nThe return of RSS and POSSE points to a revival of the personal website\necosystem that thrived in the early blog era. Writers, researchers,\ntechnologists and more are relaunching their independent homepages, complete\nwith feeds, as both a public notebook and a channel for sharing insights. The\npersonal website is the ultimate sovereign territory online, enabling creators\nto share content on their own terms. These sites export their ideas to the\ndigital public square while filtering outbound information to cultivate wisdom\nand perspective. They are living, extensible documents evolving over time\nbased on the site owner's journey.\n\nIn the Large Language Grift era, we need more visibility into source\nprovenance and credibility signals. Creators\u2019 personal sites provide this\nthrough clear origin stories and context. We know exactly who authored the\nnarratives and can evaluate them accordingly. These individuals seed networks\nwith reliable nodes by linking out from personal sites and syndicating via\nsocial channels. Their sites become operations bases and fortresses from\ngenerative excess - emitting only what they deem high signal based on careful\nconsideration.\n\nEcosystems in nature require careful balance across flora and fauna to thrive.\nSo, too, our information environment depends on thoughtful human stewards\ncurating nodes of insight across the digital public square - editors, authors,\nreporters, analysts and engaged citizens. With care and discernment, we can\nelevate human-centric content, rethinking information democracy as a shared,\ncollaborative process anchored in trusted human judgment, not computational\nfiat.\n\nSome will continue championing full automation and consolidation around a few\nplatforms, believing that is the only way to scale. But that creates a\nmonopoly of perspective, risking a monoculture vulnerable to cascading failure\nand abuse. We need interoperable protocols enabling sovereign voices to\ncontribute to the broader knowledge ecosystem. Generative algorithms can then\nbe directed to reinforce existing islands of curated insight instead of fully\nreplacing them. We have seen how healthy connectivity between online and in-\nnature networks contributes to antifragility and collective intelligence\nsurpassing any node.\n\nThere are early signs that ecosystem diversity may have an ally in these large\nlanguage models themselves. Tools like Anthropic's Constitutional AI are\ndesigned to respect existing corpora rather than overwriting them with\nautomatic outputs. Inherently cautious and assistive systems could work\nharmoniously with human-curated nodes to provide amplification without\ndisplacing editorial integrity. Constructed carefully with hybrid human-\nmachine curation in mind, these technologies can be a positive force - no\nmatter how much I gripe and grumble about AI bros.\n\nIn many ways, we have outsourced the curation of our information diets to\ndistant platforms unaligned with our interests. Reclaiming even partial agency\nin navigating knowledge networks is an act of self-care. Setting up our own\nRSS feeds, linking out to personal sites, elevating voices that inspire -\nthese actions are the basis of a healthy information democracy. One that is\ndefined by thoughtful pruning, editing and contextualising via trusted guides,\nnot by endless generation,\n\nIn every garden, seasons of growth require seasons of care - cultivating,\npruning, and even fallow periods to replenish the soil. May we embrace this\nfertility cycle of information - rather than seek to dominate and control it.\n\nJoan Westenberg\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/joanwestenberg\n\nPrevious\n\nPrevious\n\n## Bitcoin ETFs will make greater fools of us all.\n\nNext\n\nNext\n\n## AI hardware is kind of cool.\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n", "frontpage": false}
