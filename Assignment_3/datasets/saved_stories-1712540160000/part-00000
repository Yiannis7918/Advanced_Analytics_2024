Stay SaaSy.\n\n# Have Concerns And Commit\n\n04 Apr 2024 \u2022 leadership\n\nI lead a couple of teams. I could use a gut check on decision making. how do\nyou convey a top down decision (a decision that you don\u2019t buy in entirely) to\nyour team? something other than \u201chey, leadership wants x, I see a, b, and c as\npotential pitfalls in x. I have conveyed my reservations. now it\u2019s time to\ndisagree and commit\u201d\n\nThis question came in through our SaaSy question portal.\n\nThe topic of how to communicate top-down decisions that you disagree with is\nan important one. It\u2019s important because the scenario is common and it\u2019s bad\nif you get it wrong. If you regularly navigate these situations poorly, you\ncan ruin your entire culture.\n\nThe short answer for how to communicate a situation where you need to disagree\nand commit is that you first need to engage appropriately with the decision,\nand then you can mostly just describe how you engaged with the process.\n\nSo, how do you engage properly with a decision that you don\u2019t agree with?\nLet\u2019s break down the kind of decisions you might encounter:\n\n  * Non-material - it doesn\u2019t matter, e.g. if we should do taco lunch on Tuesdays or Thursdays.\n  * Material - it\u2019s important, it\u2019ll suck if we get it wrong, but it\u2019s not the end of the world. This might be like a yearly plan that isn\u2019t quite right, but isn\u2019t terrible.\n  * Critical - something really bad will happen if we get this wrong. The company\u2019s trajectory will change. Like that time the Enron guys decided how to do creative accounting.\n\nThe summary of how to engage with these decisions is:\n\n  * Non-material decisions: give feedback and move on. Debating unimportant issues wastes everyone\u2019s time. If your leadership team truly whiffs on a ton of small stuff, give feedback to that effect. When you communicate to your team, explain that feedback is important but that you need to give your coworkers the grace to make decisions.\n  * Material changes:\n\n    * If you\u2019re not sure of the answer but have concerns, you want to make sure that your feedback is deeply considered. You can tell your team that feedback was heard but ultimately the people with the most context made the call, which is how it should be.\n    * If you\u2019re absolutely sure the decision is wrong, you should really try to change the decision. We\u2019ll talk more about this later, but you\u2019re almost never going to actually be absolutely sure a decision is wrong.\n  * Critical changes: if you don\u2019t have enough information to know the right answer, again, make sure your feedback is heard. If you are absolutely sure things are headed in the wrong direction, you need to protest actively, and consider whether this is really a team that you want to remain on. But, remember - you\u2019re almost never absolutely sure.\n\nNon-material| Material| Critical  \n---|---|---  \nYou think that a decision is wrong, but you're not certain| No action| Ensure\nyour feedback is considered| Ensure your feedback is considered  \nYou're 100% certain a decision is wrong| Let someone know| Change the\ndecision| Quit  \n  \nThere are a lot of details to consider when determining how to handle a\ndecision that you disagree with. Let\u2019s explore some themes that show up in\nthese situations.\n\n## You don\u2019t have all the information for most decisions\n\nA true moment of humility comes when you realize that almost all the decisions\nyour leaders make are ones that you personally don\u2019t have enough information\nto be sure are right or wrong. Your leadership chain has more information than\nyou - often much more.\n\nThis context disparity exists in most hierarchical structures in an\norganization - mid-level managers know more than their team; high-level ICs\nhave more context than others. This is by design - having every person have\nall the information all the time is wasteful.\n\nAs a result, you should ensure you have a healthy sense of humility when\nengaging with decisions. Show your team that you can be a strong leader while\nadmitting you don\u2019t know everything.\n\nIn fact, I don\u2019t even really like the phrase \u201cdisagree and commit\u201d. That\nphrase too often leads people to think they should be either agreeing or\ndisagreeing with something. You should not agree or disagree with every\ndecision. Agreement and disagreement are levels of certainty that require\ndiligence - a bar to be crossed, not a box to check. This is yet another\ninstance where you should stop making people make up their minds.\n\nIt\u2019s much, much healthier to, for example, \u201chave concerns and commit.\u201d Some\ndecisions you can agree with, some you can disagree with, but most you should\neither just \u201chave concerns about\u201d or \u201cbe supportive of\u201d.\n\n## Getting leadership to enable you\n\nAs much as you have to be humble in your approach to engaging with decisions,\nhealthy companies and leaders should provide you with enough information to be\nable to understand decisions in enough detail to have confidence in supporting\nthe decision. Especially if you\u2019re a VP+ role in a company < ~5000 people, you\nneed to be able to fully support and explain the decisions being made. To do\nthat, you need information.\n\nOne possible pattern you might run into is having a leadership team that\nleaves you in the dark too often. This leaves you having to engage more than\nyou otherwise would to validate and understand decisions.\n\nIf you find this happening, explain the pattern to your leadership team. Good\nleaders should react and iterate on this feedback, understanding that\ninforming you more creates efficiency and trust.\n\nThis is also a lesson you should remember for your own decisions. It\u2019s\nsurprisingly easy to miss providing sufficient context. It\u2019s not uncommon to\ndo 10 weeks of work to get a really great decision, be very confident you got\nit right, and then not explain it well enough. It can be frustrating - \u201cyou\ndon\u2019t understand, we did so much to be sure.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re right, people don\u2019t understand, because you didn\u2019t help them\nunderstand.\n\nDon\u2019t let the diligence of your research convince you that you can short-\nchange the delivery of a correct result.\n\n## Letting small stuff go\n\nIt\u2019s critical that your team lets their coworkers do their job regularly\nwithout intense scrutiny on things that don\u2019t really matter. Sometimes\ndissatisfied people use small mistakes as fodder for commiseration - we didn\u2019t\neven get the All Hands timing right, how are we ever going to make major\ndecisions? These people don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing, who put them in charge?\n\nYou have to get people to understand that lots of stuff just doesn\u2019t matter.\nYou want leadership moving fast and being good-enough on small decisions. If\nyou start sniping on every little thing, your distractions will be more of a\nproblem than the things you\u2019re complaining about.\n\nIt can also be valuable to explain how organizations work to your team.\n\u201cListen, if we complain about everything it\u2019s going to be anarchy. I\u2019ll lose\nmy credibility if I\u2019m taking every single hiccup to our CEO. We have to pick\nour moments and this just isn\u2019t one of them.\u201d\n\n## Don\u2019t dismiss the wrong thing as a small thing\n\nDon\u2019t sweat the small stuff, but also don\u2019t make the mistake of thinking\nsomething isn\u2019t important when it is important. This is hard to do, but, then\nagain, this is why you get paid the big bucks.\n\nExamples include:\n\n  * Engineering office spaces. Engineers commonly place disproportionate value on their office space compared to other vocations. Part of this is that engineers are often involved in deep, uninterrupted work in the same spot. Part of it is that engineers are more likely to be in that space at 12am managing an incident. In any case, it\u2019s a common reality, and if you mistake an engineering office-space concern for a small thing, it will cause issues.\n  * Compensation timing. Sometimes people might say things like \u201cdoes it really matter if the bonus pays out a week in either direction?\u201d The answer is yes, it does. It might not matter to you, but for many people in your organization that timing can be materially impactful to their life.\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure if something is a big deal or not, ask people. Over time\nyou should have a diverse network of people on your team that can be early-\nwarning signal providers on most topics.\n\n## Forcing action on material and critical things\n\nWhen things are really important and about to go wrong, you should worry less\nabout disagreeing and committing and more about getting the right decision.\n\nFor material issues that you know are wrong, maybe once a year you have to be\nquite willful. If you\u2019re actually right and your leadership team is any good,\na reasonable amount of persistence, detailed advocacy, and explanation will\nhelp people understand the right decision. Often this will cause some people\nto be upset, and often times it\u2019ll cause friction with your peers, but you\u2019ve\ngot to drive through that to make sure important things get the right outcome.\n\nFor critical issues, perhaps once every 5 years you need to really break the\nglass and say no. If you do this at a higher frequency, you\u2019ll be labeled a\ntroublemaker and someone who cries wolf. But every once in a while you have to\nsay \u201cI\u2019m certain this is the wrong decision and moving in this direction is\nincompatible with me being on this team.\u201d\n\n## Dealing with bad leaders\n\nIt\u2019s reasonable to roughly keep track of whether certain leaders are\nconsistently making good decisions. If someone is consistently making you\ndisagree and commit to something stupid, one of you needs to go.\n\nThere are a few types of bad leaders - some are just wrong a lot, some just\nlike to disagree, others are too happy to commit \u2013 they don\u2019t take feedback OR\nthey\u2019re impulsive. Understanding which one you\u2019re dealing with tells you how\nfixable or tenable the situation is.\n\nIf you have a bad leader that is consistently making wrong decisions, you or\nsomeone in your leadership chain needs to do something about it. You can\u2019t\ntell your team that another leader is being performance managed, but you can\nsay that performance management is handled properly at the leadership level,\nand if certain leaders are making consistently bad decisions, they will be\naccounted for in that process.\n\n## Owning outcomes as a leader\n\nOne of the things you absolutely should not do is regularly disagree with\ndecisions and act like there is nothing you can do about it. There are a\ncouple components to this:\n\n  * Leaders who act helpless are helpless. Sometimes leaders admonish themselves by saying they couldn\u2019t influence decisions. But if you can\u2019t influence decisions, why are you our leader?\n  * Leaders who regularly bash their leaders should find a new job. Ultimately, as a leader, you should only be at a company if you believe it is going to succeed. The minute you start acting fatalist, or like there are unsolvable problems that inhibit you from succeeding, you need to leave.\n\nLeaders who regularly blame their leaders, offering no way of changing the\nsituation, are how Culture Viruses and political behavior emerge.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn summary, communicating a disagree-and-commit situation is most effective\nwhen you\u2019ve engaged well with the issue already. If you\u2019ve engaged properly\nwith a decision, you can simply communicate what you did.\n\nMore often than not, you shouldn\u2019t be disagreeing at all, but instead having\nconcerns about decisions. Having a culture of reasonable humility helps ensure\npeople are understanding the nuance of decisions and reacting appropriately.\n\nHere are some stock examples you can modify to use when describing various\ndecisions you don\u2019t totally agree with but have engaged with properly:\n\n  * Small decisions\n\n    * \u201cI gave feedback about the soda selection but there are a lot of stakeholders and ultimately it\u2019s something I trust our facilities team to manage.\u201d\n  * Material decisions\n\n    * \u201cI had my concerns about the widget strategy for next year and they were heard. I ultimately understand that the strategy is a combination of qualitative and quantitative and that the VP\u2019s job is to balance those and make decisions. I trust my feedback was integrated.\u201d\n  * Bad leaders\n\n    * You\u2019d only say this in a one-on-one setting: \u201cListen I know you have concerns about some of the decisions that have been made recently. All I can tell you is that I have confidence in our ability to manage performance at every level, so if those decisions are part of a track record of underperformance, it will be handled appropriately.\u201d\n\nShare to Twitter , Hacker News , LinkedIn\n\nstartups leadership management\n\n## Recent Posts\n\n  * ### Advice That I Can't Get Out of My Head 24 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### Getting Things Done In A Chaotic Environment 12 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### A Technology Leader's Non-Technical Reading List 04 Mar 2024\n\nFor new content, follow us at @staysaasy or subscribe via email.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
