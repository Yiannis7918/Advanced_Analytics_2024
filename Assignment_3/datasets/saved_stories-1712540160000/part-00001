The definition, when it comes\nto AI, means: \"to produce false information contrary to the intent of the user\nand present it as if true and factual.\" Dictionary.com added the definition\nthis year.\n\n\"Hallucinate as our 2023 Word of the Year encapsulates technology's continuing\nimpact on social change, and the continued discrepancy between the perfect\nfuture we envision and the messy one we actually achieve,\" Grant Barrett,\ndictionary.com's lexicography head, said.\n\n## Why did dictionary.com pick \"hallucinate\" as its word of the year?\n\nThere was a 45% increase in dictionary lookups for \"hallucinate\" when compared\nto last year, according to the site. There was a similar increase in searches\nfor the noun form \"hallucination.\" Overall, there was a 62% year-over-year\nspike in dictionary lookups for AI-related words.\n\n\"Our choice of hallucinate as the 2023 Word of the Year represents our\nconfident projection that AI will prove to be one of the most consequential\ndevelopments of our lifetime,\" Barrett and Nick Norlen, dictionary.com's\nsenior editor, said in a post. \"Data and lexicographical considerations aside,\nhallucinate seems fitting for a time in history in which new technologies can\nfeel like the stuff of dreams or fiction\u2014especially when they produce fictions\nof their own.\"\n\nHallucinations are a common problem with AI, Google CEO Sundar Pichai told 60\nMinutes earlier this year.\n\n\"No one in the field has yet solved the hallucination problems,\" Pichai said.\n\"All models do have this as an issue.\"\n\n## Where did the word \"hallucinate\" come from?\n\nHallucinate derives from the Latin word \u0101l\u016bcin\u0101r\u012b, meaning \"to dream\" or \"to\nwander mentally,\" according to dictionary.com senior editor of lexicography\nKory Stamper.\n\nOne of the first documented uses of the word hallucination in computer science\ndates back to a 1971 research paper, according to dictionary.com. The paper\nwas about training computers to accurately \"read\" handwriting and output it.\nHallucination and hallucinate began to appear in the context of machine\nlearning and AI in the 1990s.\n\n## What other words did dictionary.com consider for word of the year?\n\nEvents from the year, including prominent and lengthy strikes, Canadian\nwildfires and noteworthy indictments, drove dictionary.com searches. The site\nhad \"strike,\" \"wokeism,\" \"indicted\" and \"wildfire\" on its shortlist. It also\nconsidered \"rizz,\" which was chosen by the Oxford University Press as its word\nof the year.\n\nAI also influenced Merriam-Webster's word of the year for 2023, \"authentic.\"\nAccording to Merriam-Webster, stories about AI and social media drove people\nto look up \"authentic,\" which it defines as: \"not false or imitation\" and\n\"true to one's own personality, spirit, or character\" and a synonym of \"real\"\nand \"actual.\"\n\n### More from CBS News\n\nMore than 300 tried to evade airport security in the last year, TSA says\n\nNYC, New Jersey earthquake witnesses share first-hand accounts\n\nSacha Baron Cohen and Isla Fisher announce divorce after 13 years\n\nTrump Media shares slide 12% to end second week of trading\n\nIsrael finds body of a hostage killed in Gaza; cease-fire talks to resume\n\nIn:\n\n  * AI\n\nAliza Chasan\n\nAliza Chasan is a digital producer at 60 Minutes and CBSNews.com.
