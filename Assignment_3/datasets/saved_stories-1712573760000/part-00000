It\nuses a lot of .innerHTML from input taken directly out of your terminal.\n\nThis is ripe for an XSS attack or code-injection with a trivial amount of\neffort.\n\nI will hopefully address this in the future, but it is not an immediate\nconcern due to the context of its use.\n\n    \n    \n    $ some-other-program | logpipe > server running on http://localhost:7381\n\nThen go to the URL and inspect away!\n\nlogpipe parameters:\n\n  * \\--port <number>\n\n    * Choose a specific port (instead of random). Useful for command runners like nodemon.\n  * \\--title <some text>\n\n    * Title for the page. Useful if you have multiple logpipes open at once.\n\n### Redirecting Stderr\n\nMany programs will output their logs to stderr instead of stdout. If logpipe\nis not capturing anything and you still see output in your terminal, this is\nprobably what's happening.\n\nYou can use bash redirection to fix this.\n\n    \n    \n    my-program 2>&1 | logpipe # note the \"2>&1\"\n\n## Motivation\n\nWhen dealing with various codebases in development, you'll come across perhaps\nhundreds of logs per minute. Some of these are supposed to be useful. As it's\njust sending out unstructured text, it can be hard to find what you want.\nFurthermore, it often lacks syntax highlighting. It is hard to know where one\nlog ends and another starts.\n\nIn contrast, something like your browser's dev console allows filtering,\nhighlighting, and inspection of \"unstructured\" logs. The goal is to\nsupercharge this to be used for any system that outputs any kind of logs.\n\n## Behavior\n\nThis is a tool meant primarily for development. Therefore, the intention is to\nvalue assistance over correctness.\n\nThis allows us the following interesting features:\n\n  * Logpipe will syntax highlight logs that previously had no syntax highlighting.\n  * It will automatically apply tags to logs for you to search over.\n  * It will attempt to group logs that seem related (based on indentation or language grammar)\n\nIt also allows us to live-filter logs while retaining the log state -\nsomething already present in most log inspection tools.\n\n## Development\n\nIt has been helpful to use something like nodemon during development to\nautomatically restart the server when the code changes.\n\nThere is a file called out.js which is purely used to simulate logs like in a\nregular application.\n\nout.js parameters:\n\n  * \\--delay <number>\n\n    * delay in milliseconds between each log\n  * \\--iterations <number>\n\n    * number of iterations to run (default Infinity)\n\n    \n    \n    nodemon --exec 'node out.js | node index.mjs -p 7280' -e ts,html,js,mjs,css\n\n## About\n\nInspect your logs\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\n### License\n\nMIT license\n\nActivity\n\n### Stars\n\n4 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n1 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n0 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Languages\n\n  * JavaScript 81.0%\n  * HTML 10.2%\n  * CSS 8.8%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
