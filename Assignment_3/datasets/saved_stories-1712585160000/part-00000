Later on\nSunday, however, Russian state-owned nuclear agency Rosatom said three people\nwere wounded in the \u201cunprecedented series of drone attacks\u201d, specifically when\na drone hit an area close to the site\u2019s canteen.\n\nThe IAEA said on Sunday that its experts had been informed of the drone strike\nand that \u201csuch detonation is consistent with IAEA observations\u201d.\n\nIn a separate statement, the nuclear watchdog confirmed the physical impact of\ndrone attacks at the plant, including at one of its six reactors. One casualty\nwas reported, it said. \u201cDamage at unit 6 has not compromised nuclear safety,\nbut this is a serious incident with potential to undermine integrity of the\nreactor\u2019s containment system\u201d it added.\n\nThe power plant has been caught in the crossfire since Moscow sent troops into\nUkraine in 2022 and seized the facility shortly afterwards. The IAEA has\nrepeatedly expressed alarm about the nuclear power plant, Europe\u2019s largest,\namid fears of a potential nuclear catastrophe. Both Ukraine and Russia have\nregularly accused the other of attacking the plant, which is still close to\nthe front lines.\n\nThe plant\u2019s six reactors have been shut down for months, but it still needs\npower and qualified staff to operate crucial cooling systems and other safety\nfeatures.\n\nAlso on Sunday, three people were killed when their house was hit by a Russian\nprojectile in the frontline town of Huliaipole in Ukraine\u2019s partly occupied\nsouth-eastern Zaporizhzhia region, regional governor Ivan Fedorov said. Later\non Sunday, two people were wounded in another shelling of Huliaipole.\n\nSeparately, three people were wounded in Russian shelling in Ukraine\u2019s north-\neast Kharkiv region, according to regional governor Oleh Syniehubov.\n\nIn Russia, a girl died and four other people were wounded when the debris of a\ndowned Ukrainian drone fell on a car carrying a family of six people in\nRussia\u2019s Belgorod region bordering Ukraine, regional governor Vyacheslav\nGladkov said.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Ukraine\n  * Russia\n  * Europe\n  * Nuclear power\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
