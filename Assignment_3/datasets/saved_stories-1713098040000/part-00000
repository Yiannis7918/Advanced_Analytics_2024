This is how they will get a genuinely great user\nexperience, rather than a fragmented, broken one.\n\nThis website was the focal point of a talk, Andy Bell\u2014the founder of Set\nStudio\u2014did in 2022. You can watch him deliver it as a closing keynote, here.\n\n## Key Foundations & Principles\n\n  * ### Modern CSS with Methodologies\n\nInstead of brute-forcing your designs together with a CSS framework, consider\nopting for a CSS methodology like CUBE CSS, SMACSS or BEM that empowers you to\nwrite flexible, portable CSS, rather than rigid, inflexible and overly-\nspecific CSS.\n\n  * ### Fluid type & Space\n\nCreating type scales that respond to the viewport, rather than setting\nexplicit values for typography and space allows you to set rules once and\nforget about them, knowing that whatever device, regardless of its available\nsize will be presented with appropriate sizes.\n\n  * ### Flexible Layouts\n\nUsing flexible, flexbox-based layouts, like the ones we provide in Every\nLayout, ensures that regardless of conditions\u2014be it content or available\nscreen size: your front-end will be able to respond in the most appropriate\nway. Giving browsers hints and space to do what they do best, helps your\nfront-end handle tricky scenarios where breakpoint-based layouts consistently\nfail.\n\n  * ### Progressive Enhancement\n\nBuilding up with the lowest possible technological solution and enhancing it\nwhere device capability, connection speeds and context conditions allow, helps\nyou build for everyone, not just the minority of people that have fast\nconnections and powerful devices that work well, all the time.\n\nDoing the opposite: building the best experience, then hacking it down for a\nhandful of selected edge-cases means you\u2019re almost certainly going to build an\nexperience that\u2019s excludes a lot of people.\n\n> Stick to those principles and making excellent websites that work for\n> everyone suddenly becomes much, much easier.\n\n## Why though?\n\nIt was in 2010 when Ethan Marcotte published the legendary Responsive Web\nDesign article. It completely changed how we built websites for an ever-\ngrowing variety of device types and sizes.\n\nThe article has aged really well, but the practice of web design has not.\nOftentimes, designers and developers get stuck into pixel-pushing a design\ninto shape with rigid methods to ensure it looks exactly like that Figma,\nSketch or even Photoshop design. This attitude has stuck around for a long\ntime though, even as far back as the very early days of the web, which Jeremy\nKeith touched on in Resilient Web Design:\n\n> It was as though the web design community were participating in a shared\n> consensual hallucination. Rather than acknowledge the flexible nature of the\n> browser window, they chose to settle on one set width as the ideal ...even\n> if that meant changing the ideal every few years.\n>\n> Jeremy Keith - Resilient Web Design\n\nWe absolutely don\u2019t know what our audience device sizes are going to be or\nwhether or not they have a decent connection speed, fully working browser or\neven a bright enough screen to present our designs how we want them to be\npresented. We are all guilty of micromanaging the browser in some aspects, and\nin turn, are creating an inflexible and fragile user experience.\n\nA better way to approach this is to be the browser\u2019s mentor by setting some\nbase rules and hints, then getting out of its way to let it make decisions\nbased on the challenges it will undoubtedly face. Even looking at this 2015\nreport on Android device sizes tells us just how fragmented devices are. This\nwas also conducted 7 years ago and at the time of writing, it\u2019s 2022. That\u2019s a\nlong time for even more fragmentation to occur. Now factor in all of the other\nbrands and types of device and you can really see how problematic it is,\nbuilding websites in a rigid, specific manner.\n\nIt makes sense to lose a bit of perceived control and instead, get even\ngreater control by being the browser\u2019s mentor and not its micromanger, right?\n\nGo ahead and open up this website on multiple devices or just resize the\nbrowser window. You\u2019ll see it deals with anything that is thrown at it. It\nalso uses progressive enhancement to leverage modern CSS, while providing a\nsolid, base experience for browsers that don\u2019t yet support those features,\nthanks to the usage of semantic HTML. All in, it\u2019s around 2kb of CSS in total.\n\n## Tools of the trade\n\nTools are just tools. They don\u2019t really matter\u2014especially to the people trying\nto use the websites you build. The same goes for frameworks too. The most\nimportant thing is that you stick to the key principles. Even so, here are\nsome useful tools I use together to build flexible front-ends.\n\n  * ### CUBE CSS\n\nA CSS methodology that\u2019s orientated towards simplicity, pragmatism and\nconsistency.\n\n  * ### Utopia\n\nA handy collection of generators and tools that let you build up various fluid\ntype and space scales depending on viewport sizes to help with responsive\ndesign.\n\n  * ### Every Layout\n\nA series of simple, composable layouts that can be ported to any project.\nThere\u2019s also heaps of learning material to help you really learn CSS layout.\n\n  * ### Design Tokens\n\nCentralised data\u2014almost like a database of design values\u2014that could be\nconsumed by anything that understands a standard, like JSON to help with\ndesign consistency.\n\n  * ### Polypane\n\nA handy app that lets you spin up multiple viewports in various configurations\nto help you build truly responsive sites.\n\n  * ### Tailwind\n\nA utility-first CSS framework that is very useful for generating utility\nclasses on demand for CUBE CSS.\n\n## So with all that new knowledge:\n\nGo Forth And Build Excellent Websites.\n\nBy Andy Bell for Set Studio, published in 2022\n\nCheck out and remix the source code\n\n", "frontpage": false}
