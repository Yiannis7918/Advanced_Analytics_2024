The open RSS protocol has been used to\ndistribute audio since 2001, allowing podcasters the freedom to create, share,\nand monetize their work without limitations.\n\nBecause RSS is an open protocol, it\u2019s not owned or controlled by a single\nentity. This openness allows podcasters to create, distribute, and monetize\ntheir content however they\u2019d like. It also gives podcast listeners the freedom\nto choose how they listen.\n\nHowever, as big players have entered the podcast ecosystem, some listening\napps and hosting providers have introduced proprietary features. We\u2019ve seen\nthis happen before: in the 90s, Microsoft and Netscape added proprietary\nfeatures to their web browsers, creating user compatibility issues.\n\nThe Podcast Standards Project has a mission similar to the Web Standards\nProject of 1998: to promote a minimum set of open podcast standards that all\nhosting providers and listening apps should implement. This will ensure that\nthe creation and consumption of podcasts are consistent across all platforms.\n\nSome argue that innovation in podcasting is only achievable through\ncentralization. However, we believe it\u2019s possible to innovate on top of the\nopen RSS standard. We will make this happen through advocacy and collaboration\nwith all industry players (big and small).\n\nThe Podcast Standards Project aims for hosting platforms and listening apps to\nadopt a standard set of new podcasting tags and features. Only when these\nfeatures are widely supported can podcast creators and listeners benefit from\nthem.\n\n## Why is open podcasting better for podcasters?\n\nBig centralized platforms promise podcasters more distribution, but the\ntradeoffs can be significant. Social media platforms have reliably used this\nplaybook for years:\n\n  1. Entice content creators to their platform with the promise of \u201cmore distribution.\u201d\n  2. Initially, provide substantial organic reach for content.\n  3. Later, reduce the amount of organic reach a piece of content gets.\n  4. Monetize this (mostly free) content through ads and \u201cboosts\u201d (where creators have to pay to reach their own audience).\n\nWhen content creators are forced to pay for access, they invariably retreat to\nopen protocols. For example, they might ask their followers to subscribe to\ntheir email list or RSS feed. This is the benefit of open podcasting: it\u2019s a\nrefuge from centralized control.\n\nIt also gives podcasters significant advantages:\n\n  * They can monetize however they\u2019d like. For example, they\u2019re not beholden to a platform\u2019s ad networks. They can choose Value4Value, Patreon, or sell their own ads.\n  * Podcasters can also decide where their show is distributed. Most folks submit to Spotify, Apple, Google, and Amazon, but some choose to avoid platforms that don\u2019t align with their values.\n  * Podcasters can remove themselves from a directory if they no longer agree with that platform.\n  * If a platform removes a show from its directory, listeners can still access it via the RSS feed.\n  * Podcasters can host their audio files and RSS feeds wherever they want (they\u2019re not dependent on a single provider). If they want to move from one hosting company to another, importing their feed and forwarding the old feed to the new one is as simple as importing their feed.\n\n## Why is open podcasting better for listeners?\n\nWhen a podcast is purchased (or licensed) by a large listening app, it\u2019s no\nlonger available everywhere via RSS.\n\nFrom the beginning, podcast listeners have been able to choose their preferred\nlistening app. Some choose the default app installed on their phone, while\nothers choose to use apps by independent developers.\n\nThe distributed nature of podcasting has another significant advantage: hyper-\ntargeting is more challenging than in other media. Podcast hosts and podcast\napps receive limited data about listeners, which helps bring more balance\nbetween listener privacy and advertisers\u2019 interests than in other channels.\nThis also means no single entity can dominate the advertising market, leading\nto more competition. This helps ensure that no single platform dominates the\nmarket, ensuring value and market power accrue across the ecosystem.\n\nAlso, since we can innovate on top of the existing open standard, listeners\nwill get access to new features. Already, podcast RSS feeds can support\ntranscripts. Soon, we may be able to support cross-app comments, more\nmonetization options, and video podcasts in all apps.\n\n## Want to help us build the future of open podcasting?\n\nThe Podcast Standards Project is a grassroots coalition working to establish\nmodern, open standards, to enable innovation in the podcast industry.
