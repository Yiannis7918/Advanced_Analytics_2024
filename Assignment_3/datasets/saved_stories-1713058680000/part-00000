In a statistical report, the ministry notes that it considers an\nindividual record to be incomplete if it is missing any of the following key\ndata points: identity number, full name, date of birth, or date of death. The\nhealth ministry also released a report on April 3 that acknowledged the\npresence of incomplete data but did not define what it meant by \u201cincomplete.\u201d\nIn that earlier report, the ministry acknowledged the incompleteness of 12,263\nrecords. It is unclear why, after just three more days, the number fell to\n11,371 \u2014 a decrease of more than 900 records.\n\nPrior to its admissions of incomplete data, the health ministry asserted that\nthe information in more than 15,000 fatality records had stemmed from\n\u201creliable media sources.\u201d However, the ministry never identified the sources\nin question and Gaza has no independent media.\n\n## Expert Analysis\n\n\u201cThe sudden shifts in the ministry\u2019s reporting methods suggest it is\nscrambling to prevent exposure of its shoddy work. For months, U.S. media have\ntaken for granted that the ministry\u2019s top-line figure for casualties was\nreliable enough to include in daily updates on the war. Even President Biden\nhas cited its numbers. Now we\u2019re seeing that a third or more of the ministry\u2019s\ndata may be incomplete at best \u2014 and fictional at worst.\u201d \u2014 David Adesnik,\nSenior Fellow and Director of Research\n\n\u201cIt is important to recognize that Hamas is deeply invested in shaping the\nnarrative that emerges from Gaza, particularly regarding the number of\ncasualties in the war. Moreover, this control of data extends beyond the\nstatistics provided by the Hamas-controlled health ministry, as there is also\na deliberate effort to downplay the number of terrorists who have been killed\nby Israel in the war, potentially numbering more than 10,000.\u201d \u2014 Joe Truzman,\nSenior Research Analyst at FDD\u2019s Long War Journal\n\n## A Record of False Claims\n\nOn October 16, the health ministry told global media that an Israeli airstrike\nwas responsible for an explosion that killed 500 Palestinians at the Al Ahli\nArab Hospital in northern Gaza. U.S. media quickly reported the story even\nthough it became clear within hours there was no evidence to support claims of\nan airstrike or a death toll close to 500. Soon, evidence emerged showing that\na rocket fired by Palestinian terrorists was nearly certain to have caused a\nblast in the hospital\u2019s parking lot. An unclassified U.S. intelligence report\non October 18 said the blast likely caused between 100 to 300 deaths, and it\nleaned towards casualty estimates at \u201cthe low end of the 100-to-300 spectrum.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, the health ministry does not identify the individuals who died\nas a result of errant Palestinian fire, even though the Israel Defense Forces\nreported that 12 percent of rockets fired during the first month of the war\nfell inside Gaza \u2014 more than 1,000 total misfires.\n\n## Related Analysis\n\n\u201cHamas\u2019s Casualty Numbers Games,\u201d by David Adesnik\n\n\u201c5 Things To Know About The Hamas-Run Gaza Health Ministry,\u201d FDD Insight\n\n\u201cInside Hamas\u2019 propaganda game,\u201d by Joe Truzman\n\nSubscribe to FDD Flash Briefs\n\n#### Issues:\n\nIsrael Israel at War Palestinian Politics\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024\n\nFoundation for Defense of Democracies\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nP.O.
