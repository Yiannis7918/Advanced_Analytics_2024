Geller / Northwestern / CIERA / IT Research Computing and Data Services\n\nIn October 2022, an extremely bright flash caught the attention of the Gemini\nSouth telescope in Chile. It was quickly determined to be the brightest ever\nseen, hence its nickname: the Brightest Of All Time (the BOAT).\n\n#### Related Content\n\nAstronomers Found an Ultra-Dense White Star the Size of Our Moon\n\nNo, Betelgeuse Won\u2019t Go Supernova in 'Tens of Years'\u2014or Even Centuries\n\nWagner Moura on Playing a Journalist in Civil War\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nview video\n\nWagner Moura on Playing a Journalist in Civil War\n\nNow, a group of researchers has examined the event with the Webb Space\nTelescope and concluded that the BOAT\u2019s cause was a supernova: an explosive\nand brilliant death of a star. The researchers also looked for heavy elements\nlike gold and platinum but saw no signs of them, leaving the question of their\norigins just as open as before. The team\u2019s research is published today in\nNature Astronomy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Related Content\n\nAstronomers Found an Ultra-Dense White Star the Size of Our Moon\n\nNo, Betelgeuse Won\u2019t Go Supernova in 'Tens of Years'\u2014or Even Centuries\n\nWagner Moura on Playing a Journalist in Civil War\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nWagner Moura on Playing a Journalist in Civil War\n\nHeavy elements are produced by neutron-star mergers\u2014at least, some of them\nare. The heavy stuff in the universe is too abundant for such stellar mergers\nto account for all of them. Even after two stars in a binary system explode,\nleaving the dense shells that are neutron stars, \u201cit can take billions and\nbillions of years for the two neutron stars to slowly get closer and closer\nand finally merge,\u201d according to Peter Blanchard, an astronomer at\nNorthwestern University and the study\u2019s lead author, in university release.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut observations of very old stars indicate that parts of the universe were\nenriched with heavy metals before most binary neutron stars would have had\ntime to merge,\u201d Blanchard added. \u201cThat\u2019s pointing us to an alternative\nchannel.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGamma-ray bursts come in two flavors: long- and short-duration. Short bursts\nare associated with stars merging and black holes forming, according to NASA,\nwhile the longer bursts are associated with stellar deaths. The BOAT is\nstaunchly in the latter camp.\n\nRings of dust spewed out by the BOAT, as seen by the XMM-Newton\nObservatory.Image: ESA/XMM-Newton/M. Rigoselli (INAF)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe team intentionally waited for several months after the BOAT was detected\nto turn the Webb Telescope toward it. That\u2019s because the explosion was so\nbright\u2014and that brightness persisted for so long\u2014that they needed to wait for\nthe event to fade to spot any sign of the supernova that bore it.\n\nUsing the telescope\u2019s Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec), the team looked at\nthe elements typically seen in supernovae. The signal wasn\u2019t particularly\nbright, indicating that the supernova that yielded the brightest gamma ray\nburst ever seen wasn\u2019t superlative itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis event is particularly exciting because some had hypothesized that a luminous gamma-ray burst like the B.O.A.T. could make a lot of heavy elements like gold and platinum,\u201d said study co-author Ashley Villar, an astrophysicist at Harvard University and the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian, in the release. \u201cIf they were correct, the B.O.A.T. should have been a goldmine. It is really striking that we didn\u2019t see any evidence for these heavy elements.\u201d\n\nLong gamma ray bursts are those that last more than two seconds. The BOAT\nlasted a staggering 10 hours, according to ScienceNews. But if we\u2019re being\ntechnical, the BOAT isn\u2019t actually the BOAT. But it is \u201clikely the brightest\nburst at X-ray and gamma-ray energies to occur since human civilization\nbegan,\u201d according to Eric Burns, an astrophysicist at Louisiana State\nUniversity a co-author of a study describing the signal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA year and change after the signal, a scientific collaboration determined that\nthe BOAT put out gamma-rays with energies reaching up to 13\nteraelectronvolts\u2014the same energy as CERN\u2019s Large Hadron Collider during its\nsecond run.\n\nScientists continue to sift through the trove of data yielded by the BOAT.\nLast June, a group reported on the structure of the burst\u2019s jet, which may\ncause physicists to rework their models of jet structure. Despite all its\naccolades, the BOAT is not the largest explosion ever seen in space; that\ntitle belongs to AT2021lwx, a nearly 8-billion-year-old outburst from a\ndistant black hole and the gas cloud surrounding it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAstronomers will likely see more explosions like it\u2014and like the BOAT\u2014when\nnext-generation observatories come online. One of the facilities with the most\nhype around it is the Vera Rubin Observatory in Chile\u2019s Atacama Desert, which\nwill use a 3.2-billion-pixel camera to collect terabytes of data on the\nsouthern sky every night.\n\nMore: The World\u2019s Biggest Digital Camera Is Finally Complete\n\n", "frontpage": false}
