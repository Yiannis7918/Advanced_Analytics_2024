WOO WOO! Here are a few quick statistics for the work that went\ninto the second edition:\n\n  * 32 files changed\n  * 9521 insertions\n  * 6124 deletions\n  * 548 commits\n  * 31 weeks\n  * 1 author (me)\n  * 1 research assistant (Wilbur Powery)\n  * 3 tech reviewers (Samantha Geitz, Mohamed Said, Tate Pe\u00f1aranda)\n  * 1 editor (Alicia Young)\n  * 1 production editor (Christopher Faucher)\n  * 1 copyeditor (Rachel Head)\n  * 1 indexer (?)\n  * 7 email chains with the O'Reilly tooling support\n  * 1 new chapter (The Laravel Ecosystem)\n  * 1 entirely re-written chapter (Testing)\n  * ??? new Laravel tools added\n  * 516 total pages of content\n\nThere are a lot more fun stats I could probably come up with but, to be\nhonest, I'm tired of working on this book and I want to see it get published\nnow!\n\nWhile it's in the hands of the O'Reilly production and QA team, though, I\nwanted to share a little bit of what it's like to write a book like this. I've\noften seen folks self-publish a book without any editors or proofreaders or\nanything, and especially with the second edition of my book, I took basically\nthe opposite approach. So, I wanted to share a bit of who helped me\u2014both the\nbroader roles, but also the specific people.\n\nThere was a similar group of people who helped me in the first edition, but\nI'm going to be writing up my second edition team here because I made a big\nshift in how I wrote the book that I want to share.\n\n## The O'Reilly Structure\n\nMost of how my editing process worked was the traditional O'Reilly structure.\nI wrote the book in git, in AsciiDoc, using the MarkdownEditing plugin. Here's\nwhat it looks like:\n\nOnce I finished writing in any session, I would push it up to O'Reilly's Atlas\nplatform, where my O'Reilly editor could review it and we could both generate\npreviews:\n\n### Editor\n\nOnce I had finished a chapter, or a series of chapters, I'd get high-level\neditorial insight from my O'Reilly Editor, Alicia Young. These edits would be\nthings about writing style and communication; here's one of her notes from my\ntesting chapter:\n\n> The idea of fidelity of tests isn't really discussed elsewhere. Is that\n> something your readers will be familiar with? I admit I had a hard time\n> understanding the distinction based on the examples you give after this\n> statement, so you may want to add another line of explanation further\n> clarifying this term in this context.\n\nShe gave me 73 comments on chapters 12-18, for example, most of which were\nminor wording changes to make a sentence clearer.\n\n### Tech reviewers\n\nI had a group of tech reviewers that I found who were willing to read through\nthe whole book for a small stipend and give any notes they found. These were\nusually technical issues\u2014ranging from \"You keep referencing Eloquent but we\nhaven't had the Eloquent chapter yet\" to \"What about referencing the @csrf\nhelper here?\" to \"I don't think this code would actually work.\"\n\n### Production\n\nI can't say I remember exactly everyone who's involved in production, but\nhere's what I know so far.\n\nI know I have a production editor who is, as the name suggests, the editor of\nthe production process. They'll be responsible for getting all the right\npeople lined up to take their crack at the book, from copyeditors (who mainly\nhandle writing-related issues) to indexers (or whatever you call the people\nwho mark the book up for the index) to layout people who handle weird page\nbreaks and stuff like that.\n\nThere's a lot that goes on here, and most of it is entirely outside of my\nworld\u2014I just watch the git commits roll in, and at one point I get a PDF of\nnotes from the copyeditor to review.\n\n## My own setup\n\nOutside of the setup that O'Reilly provides, I've also brought on a little bit\nof help. For the first edition, I brought in a different group of wonderful\ntech reviewers into O'Reilly's system. I also got help in the form of a few of\nthe early readers giving me some proofreader-style feedback after we released\nthe book, which I was able to incorporate into later releases (thanks to all\nof you!)\n\nFor the second edition, I knew the book was ready for a big refresh (it\ncovered up to Laravel 5.3 and we were now on 5.5, heading toward 5.6). But I\njust didn't have time. My wife's acting career is taking off, my kids are\ngetting older, Tighten is busy and I just don't have dozens of hours a week to\nspend updating the book.\n\n### A research assistant\n\nBut, I had an idea: I would hire someone to handle two primary jobs: combing\nthrough the release logs and docs changes of the last few versions of Laravel\nto make sure we updated everything, and then running all of the code samples\nin the book in the latest version of Laravel to make sure it worked.\n\nI hired my friend Wilbur Powery to take on this task, and he became my\nresearch assistant, sending in pull requests with small modifications to the\ncode samples or some of the documentation, or any time it was more than just a\nsyntax change, leaving me a note inline that I should write or delete or\nmodify a bigger section.\n\nWith this help, I was able to essentially ignore the book for weeks at a time\nwhile Wilbur would research the next chapter and deliver his notes. Then, once\neach chapter was done, I would approve all of his minor edits, and then sit\ndown to write or re-write any bigger sections that had changed significantly.\n\n### The printout\n\nOnce that was all done, I printed the entire book and had it bound. I read the\nentire book cover to cover over the span of a few weeks, poring over every\nsentence and example with a pen or marker and a huge stack of mini postit page\nmarking tabs.\n\nOnce that was done, I entered those changes in manually.\n\n## Next steps\n\nI mentioned this on Twitter, but as I was about to publish this article, we\ndiscovered the book wouldn't go to print until early February 2019, which is\nright around when Laravel 5.8 was going to come out. So, I worked with my\neditors to add a bit of time into the production timeline so we can update it\nfor 5.8 and then push it out in early March.\n\nHere's a really rough timeline of events\u2014(without dates, but you can at least\nsee what the order is like:\n\n  * Suggest book to publisher\n  * Negotiate contract and rough timelines\n  * Write book\n  * Get feedback from editor and tech reviewers\u2014preferably in small chunks as writing progresses but sometimes in larger chunks as half or all of the book is done\n  * Personal review\n  * Send the final-ish copy to Production\n  * Copy editing (and me reviewing the edits)\n  * Indexing (and me reviewing the index)\n  * Final review\n  * Files to printer and eBook generation\n  * Book delivered to sellers\n\nI think that's all for now. Off to get Wilbur and me started with making a\nlist of edits for 5.8!\n\nShare:\n\nComments?
