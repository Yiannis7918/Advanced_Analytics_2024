The ecosystem is growing and changing so rapidly that it\u2019s hard to\nunderstand the problems that different tools are trying to solve. I started\nprogramming in 1998 but only began to learn JavaScript seriously in 2014. At\nthe time I remember coming across Browserify and staring at its tagline:\n\n> \u201cBrowserify lets you require(\u2018modules\u2019) in the browser by bundling up all of\n> your dependencies.\u201d\n\nI pretty much didn\u2019t understand any word in this sentence, and struggled to\nmake sense of how this would be helpful for me as a developer.\n\nThe goal of this course is to provide a historical context of how JavaScript\ntools have evolved to what they are today. We\u2019ll start from the beginning and\nbuild an example website like the dinosaurs did \u2014 no tools, just plain HTML\nand JavaScript. Then we\u2019ll introduce different tools incrementally to see the\nproblems that they solve one at a time. With this historical context, you\u2019ll\nbe better able to learn and adapt to the ever-changing JavaScript landscape\ngoing forward.
