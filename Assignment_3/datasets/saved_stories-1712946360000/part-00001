I came up\nwith many of them on my own a few years ago, many of which are listed here.\nthe doses are pretty reasonable and I trust the sourcing to at least be above\naverage\n\nthis post is not sponsored or paid for in any way, but I\u2019ve met BJ and think\nhe is reasonably smart and funny. below I include images, nutritional\ninformation, and plenty of links and side notes to share what I\u2019ve learned!\n\nEverything I got for one month at a cost of $343\n\n## Nutty pudding\n\nThe nutty pudding mixAfter being mixed with whole milk\n\nIngredients for the nutty pudding mix\n\n  * mostly plant protein, giving you 26g of protein per serving\n  * allulose as a sweetener is great and I\u2019m happy to see it becoming more common (see my post on allulose for why). may want to note to consumers what it does and why they might notice it\n  * cinnamon and grape seed both great inclusions\n  * no opinion on pomegranate and monk fruit extract. I\u2019m assuming the latter is as a sweetener and flavor enhancer\n  * the taste is... alright. some people definitely like it more than I do, but I\u2019d probably only rate it a 5/10 myself. I substituted whole milk in instead of nut milk as suggested and added the blueberry mix (below) to it to finish it. it tastes like a rather bland pudding, but a bit more dense and with little sugar or fat\n\n## Blueberry mix\n\nBlueberry mix!\n\n  * it\u2019s literally just dried blueberries, macadamia nuts, and walnuts\n  * tastes great no matter what do you with it really. I\u2019d suggest adding it to the above pudding or combining it with some milk\n  * blueberries are great for you and a good snack to have around\n  * with that said, this mix is so simple that I\u2019m not sure I gain much from having someone else prepare it for me\n\n## Longevity mix\n\nLongevity mix powderLongevity mix powder mixed with water and encased by glass\n\nNutrition info for the longevity mix\n\n  * simple mix that you add to water\n  * creatine, glucosamine, taurine, glycine, the gang\u2019s all here\n  * allulose again chosen as the primary sweetener\n  * I\u2019d increase the amount of glycine (1.5g), especially due to this being earlier in the day so it\u2019s unlikely to be too much to disrupt sleep (this dose would be fine before bed and likely benefit sleep but the instructions online suggest to have this mix in the morning). for more information on why I\u2019m in favor of macrodosing glycine check out the glycine section on my supplements page (hint: it extends lifespan in mice!)\n  * sodium hyaluronate is an interesting choice and I wonder why they chose it + this form of it\n  * i\u2019m a big fan of ashwagandha, with the note that it can cause digestive distress for some. great for lipid profile and often improves anxiety too\n  * there could be a bit more creatine (2.5g) for those lifting, especially since calcium alpha-ketoglutarate was added\n  * the taste is decent and comparable to most \u2018vitamin\u2019 drink mixes that you add to water. I\u2019d probably rate it a 6.5/10, nothing to complain about but not particularly exciting\n\n## Pills!\n\nThe four bottles that I got along with what the pills from each look like. The\ndaily suggested dosage is 3 pills from each of the larger bottles and 1 from\neach of the smaller, for a daily total of 8. Certainly not as bad as what was\nfeatured on my supplements page!\n\n## NAC, ginger, curcumin\n\nNutrition info for the NAC, ginger, and curcumin capsules\n\n  * NAC is reasonably popular in the longevity community and pretty interesting\n  * not 100% sure what the reasoning behind ginger was \u2013 I wonder if it was due to its ability to ameliorate potential gastrointestinal side effects of other supplements?\n  * circumin is generally a good choice, although I have concerns about lower bioavailability here. does one of the other supplements included notably modify this?\n\n## Essential capsules\n\nNutrition info for the essential capsules\n\n  * not going to list all the vitamins as they\u2019re all reasonable choices\n  * glad to see a higher amount of vitamin D (2,000 IU). could go even higher but the average blueprint consumer probably gets more sunlight than I do\n  * I don\u2019t know what the benefits of including e.g. iodine, calcium, manganese, and selenium are. would these be missed at all if excluded? feel free to enlighten me if you\u2019re a reader!\n  * lithium is interesting at 1mg but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s high enough to do very much (although perhaps this is the intention to keep it on the safe side)\n  * I didn\u2019t know that the body converts glucoraphanin into sulforaphane via myrosinase. good supplement!\n  * fisetin at100mg daily is an interesting choice. curious how they decided daily was the correct increment and 100mg was the correct dose \u2013 I found this one hard to decide on myself\n  * spermidine 10mg is perhaps one of the most promising supplements here due to directly improving lifespan in mice! how did they source this? see more info in the spermadine section on my supplements page\n  * genistein is an interesting choice as it is pretty estrogenic. there are a lot of gender-ambiguous benefits to this, but i\u2019m curious what the specific reasoning was and how the dose of 300mg was decided. it has affinity for \u03b1 estrogen receptors, but not as much as \u03b2. if it was easier to source and include 17\u03b1-estradiol, would that have been included instead? was this included for entirely different reasons, of which there could be many? see also: does 17\u03b1-estradiol/estrogen extend male human lifespan?\n\n## Essential softgel\n\nNutrition info from the essential softgels\n\n  * nothing particularly exciting here, nice to see the better forms of vitamin k (k1, k2 mk4, k2 mk7) all included\n  * astaxanthin is a nice inclusion\n  * less excited over lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin, but I don\u2019t know anything bad about them. would like to research them more later\n\n## Garlic, red yeast rice\n\nNutrition info for the garlic and red yeast rice pills\n\n  * unsure why these are in their own pill instead of included within one of the larger mixes (from which you take 3 daily from)\n  * garlic is great if we give them the benefit of the doubt on the 12:1 exact including enough allicin\n  * does the red yeast rice (500mg) actually contain a lot of monacolin k? some countries like the US dislike this due to it being bioidentical to e.g. lovastatin\n  * interesting side note: when you research a lot of natural compounds (roots, vegetable extracts, etc), it\u2019s very interesting how many of them are bioidentical to actual pharmaceuticals. when I was young I didn\u2019t understand why \u2018vegetables\u2019 or such should be good for me: adults would tell me they had \u201cvitamins and minerals\u201d in them, but I could obviously both a) test myself for vitamin and mineral deficiencies and b) supplement them if I was deficient in them. it wasn\u2019t until many, many years later that I learned how amazingly complex everything we eat is and how many biologically active ingredients are in dishes. think of a dish with many vegetables, spices, roots, meat, etc, as basically having 20 different drugs in it, but with all of them in very small doses. many of them are also very slightly psychoactive too! just as you can get high on nutmeg and sweet potatoes inhibit \u03b1-glucosidase and are thus anti-diabetic like the drug acarbose and red yeast rice is literally the same as a statin medication and berberine found in plants like barberry is a mimetic of the anti-diabetic drug metformin, the foods we eat on a daily basis have an astoundingly large amount of downstream effects in the body which have nothing to do with the vitamins or minerals in them. the cases we tend to know about like marajuana or opium are not rare in that they have strong biological effects, but rather are only rare in the dose response curves that are common with consumption. the present epistemic milieu we reside in with respect to nutrition doesn\u2019t talk about this much primarily because we know so little about the topic and actually learning what is going on enough to have high confidence and rigor is extremely tedious and slow\n\n## Olive oil\n\n  * it\u2019s olive oil. it is made from olives\n  * the branding of \u2018snake oil\u2018 is honestly pretty funny given how most supplement marketing is basically fraudulent\n\n## Marketing\n\n  * no cards or instructions were included in the box. this is missing out on a gigantic free lunch!\n  * I\u2019d strongly suggest adding instructions, a thank-you card, and a discount code for future purchases\n  * the discount code should be notable as user retention may be more challenging than other monthly supplements due to the tediousness of consumption (8 pills, one drink mix, one pudding mix, olive oil, and another mix, every single day!)\n  * given the higher price point it would be great if the bags could be redone to have a high-quality zipper on them as sealing them is annoying\n  * the supplement bottles should be shinier. this will increase conversion as this product is offered at a \u2018premium\u2019 price point. I\u2019d look into making a bespoke logo for blueprint as well or otherwise refining the font and decor around it. you will be surprised how much of a return you can get by spending $0.10 more on shiny paper and branding!\n  * I would move supplements with the highest probability of causing digestive distress into their own pill so that users can modulate dosage or ablate it themselves for e.g. supplements like ashwaganda and curcumin. this should be included in the instructions as otherwise users who feel unwell may simply never try blueprint again\n  * current marketing paradigm likely favors a cohort of more males than females and more adolescents than the elderly. this is reasonable and likely the correct choice to make early on, but I\u2019d consider long-term strategies on how to improve this. encouraging gifting to the elderly (e.g. one\u2019s parents) is likely a great idea here for obvious reasons\n\n## Research and sourcing\n\n  * most of what is included is good, but I\u2019m not told why it was included! if there was so much money spent on research and reviewing studies, it would be great if some of it could be shared to me as a lowly and uninformed end-user\n  * why does the blueprint page advertise \u2018non-gmo\u2019, and what does \u2018no artificial ingredients\u2019 mean? generally the latter means next to nothing, but I don\u2019t actually care if something as simple to synthesize as e.g. glycine is \u2018artificial\u2019 or not as long as it is the right chemical and without contaminants or impurities! modify labels for your intended audience accordingly\n  * similarly to sharing research the website states that you \u201ctest the ingredients\u201d yourselves. I assume this means more than just eating them and making sure you don\u2019t die, but this seems like a great thing to share more about, especially because this is very tedious to do\n  * having users share metrics before and after a few months of blueprint consumption would be great (BJ told me isn\u2019t necessary as the individual ingredients already have sufficient evidence on their own. but if you ask me, there is never enough science being done and there is never enough data, so I\u2019d prefer we continue to learn all that we can even if it only confirms our priors)\n  * relatedly I\u2019m concerned that some of the supplements may inhibit various enzymes that then cause unknown and/or undesired changes of bioavailability in other supplements or drugs. both curcumin and ginger inhibit CYP3A4 and this may be suboptimal if combined with other longevity drugs like rapamycin (which, similarly, could block astaxanthin which blueprint includes as well). this is challenging as we have limited knowledge on this topic for most supplements and drugs, but is worth at least being aware of\n  * fortunately i\u2019ve written from-scratch personal tracking software that I can throw all of this data into in order to solve a few of the questions (those which are easily answerable via blood tests at least), but this is costly and tedious and I am tired of getting blood tests. I may try A/B testing all of blueprint RCT-style to see if I can notice any other variables it effects that I wouldn\u2019t have otherwise predicted\n\n## Final thoughts\n\n  * overall this is a decent purchase if you want to make the trade-off of spending more money for not having to perform your own research, logistics, sourcing, purchasing, etc\n  * with that said, there\u2019s secondary effects to note: a) the substitution effect of having something decent rather than what you\u2019d have had instead (this is why most \u2018diets\u2019 are always an improvement: the typical American diet is so bad that basically anything that is not insane is likely to be a net-benefit), and b) the psychological effect of causing you to consciously think more about optimizing for your health. I would strongly bet that there is a \u2018healthy user bias\u2019 among blueprint users that results in them having e.g. better lipid and glycemic profiles than non-blueprint users even if they stopped taking blueprint as they probably get more exercise than average\n  * the largest benefits in longevity may still be things that we cannot easily sell in a bag or bottle, whether that is because it is intangible like exercise, or because of excessive regulation (e.g. the revolutionary weight-loss drug semaglutide requires a prescription and often insurance, although notably can also be purchased online regardless from parties which are not fans of the US patent system. even so, clinical trials for it began 15 years ago which likely resulted in the early death of millions of americans due to obesity. other longevity drugs like rapamycin are also challenging to distribute to the average consumer for similar reasons (and that one is FDA-approved too!). the FDA is excessively conservative in what they allow, with drugs requiring a decade and ~$600M to be later slowly distributed to the general public, and this is before we even bring in talk of gene therapies or anything newer\n  * alpha in longevity (both personal and scientific) still remains in copious quantities for those who are willing to search for it!\n  * I haven\u2019t yet decided if I\u2019ll purchase another month of blueprint. I\u2019ll try it for a bit longer and see how I feel, but I think it\u2019s a reasonable product overall and I\u2019m glad it exists\n  * If you enjoyed this post you might like my website (see also: supplements) or my twitter\n  * feedback (especially any potential corrections) is very welcome!
