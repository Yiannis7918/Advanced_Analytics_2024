His\nnote to employees is below.\n\nHi Googlers,\n\nWe\u2019re coming off an amazing Cloud Next \u2014 congrats again to all involved. It\nwas nice to see the recognition of our leading AI tools and infrastructure,\nand all the ways our customers are using them. Excited to show more progress\nduring our earnings call next Thursday. Today, I want to share some changes\nwe\u2019re making across the company to simplify decisions and help us work better\nand faster.\n\nThere\u2019s context below for the changes in 4 parts: 1. Models and Research; 2.\nResponsible AI; 3. Platforms and Devices; and 4. Mission First. It's a long\nnote, but I want you to see the full rationale.\n\nThese changes continue the work we've done over the past year to simplify our\nstructure and improve velocity and execution \u2014 such as bringing together the\nBrain team in Google Research with teams in DeepMind, which helped accelerate\nour Gemini models; unifying our ML infrastructure and ML developer teams to\nenable faster decisions, smarter compute allocation, and a better customer\nexperience; and bringing our Search teams under one leader.\n\n\\- Sundar\n\n## State-of-the-art foundation models and research\n\nLast year we created Google DeepMind, bringing together the Google Brain team,\nDeepMind, and other researchers specifically focused on creating increasingly\ncapable and general AI systems.\n\nThe progress in just one year has been incredible: Gemini models are seen as\nleaders and keep getting better. And our successive breakthroughs have put us\non a path to deliver the world\u2019s most advanced, safe, and responsible AI.\n\nNow, to accelerate this progress, we\u2019re going to consolidate the teams that\nfocus on building models across Research and Google DeepMind. All of this work\nwill now sit in Google DeepMind and scale our capacity to deliver capable AI\nfor our users, partners and customers. This will simplify development by\nconcentrating compute-intensive model building in one place and establishing\nsingle access points for PAs looking to take these models and build generative\nAI applications.\n\nThis change also gives Google Research a clear and distinct mandate to\ncontinue investing in foundational and applied computer science research in\nthree key areas that tie directly to Google\u2019s mission: computing systems\n(including quantum), foundational ML and algorithms, and applied science and\nsociety. Fundamental computer science research is in our DNA and we have some\nof the world's best computer scientists. We simply would not be the company we\nare today without the researchers who developed the foundations on which all\nGoogle\u2019s products are built and are now inventing the foundations for our\nfuture.\n\nExcited to see what these teams accomplish in their new formation. James in\nhis role across Research and Tech & Society and Labs will continue to oversee\nGoogle Research with Yossi as the dedicated leader reporting to him. James and\nDemis will keep working as closely as they always have, and Google DeepMind\nand Google Research will continue their collaborations.\n\n## Responsibility and safety\n\nWe are a longstanding leader in building and deploying responsible AI. Last\nyear, along with other companies, we committed to a set of measures to develop\nAI safely and responsibly.\n\nWe need to be the best in class at deploying accurate, trustworthy, and\ntransparent AI products for users and customers. To help do this, we're making\nchanges to the way our Responsible AI teams work at crucial points in the\ndevelopment cycle.\n\n  * We\u2019re moving Responsible AI teams in Research to Google DeepMind, to be closer to where the models are built and scaled.\n  * We've recently moved other responsibility teams into our central Trust and Safety team, where we are investing more in AI testing and evals.\n  * These shifts create clearer responsibility and accountability at every level as we build and deploy, and strengthen the feedback loop between models, products, and users.\n\nBeyond these changes, our teams have also been working hard to improve our\nprocesses and are making good progress: We\u2019re standardizing launch\nrequirements for AI-powered features and increasing investments in \u201cred team\u201d\ntesting for vulnerabilities and broader evaluations to help ensure responses\nare accurate and responsive to our users\u2019 prompts. This is vital, ongoing\nwork.\n\n## Computing platforms and devices\n\nAI gives us an incredible opportunity to reimagine computing platforms for the\nnext decade \u2014 transforming Android, Chrome, Search, Photos and so many other\nproducts to be more helpful for people everywhere.\n\nTo truly drive computing forward, we need to do it at the intersection of\nhardware, software and AI. So we are formalizing the collaboration between\nDSPA and P&E and bringing the teams together in a new PA called Platforms &\nDevices. And the Google Research teams focused on computational photography\nand on-device intelligence will also be moving over to join the new org to\nbring deep AI expertise across platforms and devices.\n\nHaving a unified team across Platforms & Devices will help us deliver higher\nquality products and experiences for our users and partners. It will help us\nturbocharge the Android and Chrome ecosystems, and bring the best innovations\nto partners faster \u2014 as we did with Circle to Search with Samsung. And\ninternally, it will also speed up decision-making.\n\nRick will oversee the entire PA and Sameer will step up to lead across our\nAndroid ecosystem. Hiroshi, who has done so much to grow Android, Chrome,\nChromeOS, G1 and Photos, will advise on the transition even as he starts work\non some new projects across Alphabet. This includes piloting a new role as\nexecutive sponsor of Japan. Hiroshi and I have been discussing these changes\nfor many months, and I\u2019m excited to see him lead across a new set of\nchallenges.\n\nOur P&E and DSPA teams have made such great progress in recent years: Google\nOne just passed 100M subscribers, Chrome is used by billions of people, and\nAndroid \u2014 now at 3 billion active devices and counting \u2014 is only getting\nstronger. It enables a vibrant ecosystem of manufacturers, carriers, silicon\nmakers like Qualcomm, and hundreds of thousands of developers who use the\nplatform to compete in the global market. On top of that, our Pixel family of\ndevices has been growing well, and helps to spur innovation \u2014 and accelerate\nthe adoption of the latest Android and AI features \u2014 across the ecosystem.\nIt\u2019s exciting to see these teams joining forces and strengthening their\ncollaboration to benefit users and partners.\n\n## Mission first\n\nOne final note: All of the changes referenced above will help us work with\ngreater focus and clarity towards our mission. However, we also need to be\nmore focused in how we work, collaborate, discuss and even disagree. We have a\nculture of vibrant, open discussion that enables us to create amazing products\nand turn great ideas into action. That's important to preserve. But ultimately\nwe are a workplace and our policies and expectations are clear: this is a\nbusiness, and not a place to act in a way that disrupts coworkers or makes\nthem feel unsafe, to attempt to use the company as a personal platform, or to\nfight over disruptive issues or debate politics. This is too important a\nmoment as a company for us to be distracted.\n\nWe have a duty to be an objective and trusted provider of information that\nserves all of our users globally. When we come to work, our goal is to\norganize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and\nuseful. That supersedes everything else and I expect us to act with a focus\nthat reflects that.\n\nThank you.\n\nPOSTED IN:\n\n###\n\nRelated stories\n\n  * Company announcements\n\n#### Hello, El Salvador!
