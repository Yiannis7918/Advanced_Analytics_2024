For $0.99 a year, you can register any .xyz domain inbetween\n000000.xyz through 999999999.xyz. They call it: 1.111B class.\n\nThey list some suggested uses on what to use these domains for:\n\n> ... Internet of Things device connectivity, vanity identification, digital\n> currencies, and any other creative uses...\n\nThe entire 1.111B class has 1,111,000,000 domains (1.111B domains). It wasn\u2019t\nfeasible to scan over a billion addresses. But, it was to scan the first 5\nmillion or so. Of the 5 million scanned, I found that just over 50,000 were\nregistered and had DNS records. I present (what I think is) a cool map you can\nexplore of registed domains.\n\nUse shift + click to pan and mousewheel to zoom. Zoom in and click on a pixel\nto view more information. Details are displayed at the bottom of the screen!\n\nEach pixel represents a domain. They\u2019re grouped by hosts. If two domains share\nthe same hosts, they share the same color. Happy exploring!\n\nA lot of these links are porn and are NSFW!\n\nThis data is most likely out-dated as of posting this as I completed the\nscanning earlier this year. The complete dataset is available for download:\nsimply inspect this page\u2019s network traffic to get the file. If you\u2019re an\nadministrator to any of these sites I would highly recommend you remove test\nor dev machines you don\u2019t want hacked.\n\nby will meyers\n\n", "frontpage": false}
