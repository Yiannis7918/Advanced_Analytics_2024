The bills, HB 1838 and SB 2919, passed\nwith amendments on Tuesday and will go back to their chambers of origin for\nfinal votes.\n\nIf passed into law, the bills would effectively give those local governments\nto ability to ban most Airbnb listings.\n\nThe Office of Hawaiian Affairs, a self-governing agency whose nonpartisan\nmembers are elected by voters statewide, testified in March that more than\nhalf of all short-term rentals (STRs) in Hawaii are owned by people living\nout-of-state, and more than a quarter of STR owners own more than 20 units.\nThe median rent in Hawaii is more than $2,200 and the median home price is\n$839,000, making it the most expensive state to live in the U.S.\n\nThese short-term listings \u201chave proven to be more profitable than renting to\nlocal families, but this profit often comes at the cost of the communities\nwhere they're located,\u201d the OHA testified.\n\nThe shortage in Hawaii has become even more dire following last year\u2019s\nwildfires, which destroyed thousands of units of housing and most of the\ncommunity of Lahaina and killed more than a hundred people. On multiple\noccasions since the wildfires, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green has threatened to\nrepurpose vacation properties into housing for victims of the fires, but has\nnot followed through; in March, he said a moratorium on vacation rentals\nwasn\u2019t necessary because enough units had been secured for the more than 3,000\nsurvivors still living in hotels. Though the state said in March that dozens\nof survivors of the fires are moving into housing, thousands remain in hotels,\nthe AP reported last month.\n\nLast year, New York City cracked down on short-term rentals, requiring hosts\nto register with the city before they\u2019re able to rent out a property. Airbnb\ndenounced the new regulations and released a poll in December purporting to\nshow that visitors are \u201cless likely to visit\u201d New York City, a place visited\nby more than 62 million people in 2023. The city of Memphis also passed short-\nterm rental restrictions last year, and in 2022, Honolulu banned rentals under\n90 days, though a federal judge has ruled to allow short-term rentals at\nproperties that were rented out before the ordinance passed.\n\nAirbnb is also lobbying hard against the proposals in Hawaii. Their efforts\nare headed up by former state Attorney General David Louie, who is also a\nlobbyist for Meta.\n\nJordan Ruidas, a Lahaina fire survivor and activist with the group Lahaina\nStrong, testified in February that the House bill would be \u201ccrucial\u201d for\nfamilies in Lahaina, and told SFGate this week the organization supports both\nbills.\n\n\u201cThe thought of the possibility of my keiki [children] and my future\ngrandchildren not being able to stay and live in Hawaii is haunting,\u201d Ruidas\ntold SF Gate.\n\nWatch our latest report on how short-term rentals are driving up housing\ncosts:\n\n####\n\nWhat\u2019s happening in the states\n\n  * Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin continued his unprecedented spree of vetoes by nixing a plan to create a Prescription Drug Affordability Board. Among his other vetoes: a $15 state minimum wage, extradition protections for abortion providers, and legal weed.\n\n  * Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is suing the state\u2019s largest county, Harris, to stop a guaranteed income pilot program for 1,900 of the poorest households in the county. The program would give those households $500 a month for 18 months, no strings attached; these programs, studies almost always show, help to alleviate poverty.\n\n  * The Pennsylvania legislature took its first steps toward reforming a controversial state law that encourages the sale of municipally-owned water and sewer systems to investor-owned corporations. In the nearly two dozen municipalities that have sold their utilities under the new rules, residents have seen their water and sewer bills skyrocket by hundreds of dollars a year.\n\n  * For the second straight year, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear has vetoed a bill to allow autonomous, driverless vehicles on Kentucky roads. The legislation is opposed by the Teamsters, who called it \u201ca threat to middle-class jobs and public safety.\u201d\n\n  * Mississippi, one of the poorest states in the country, appears to be inching further toward passing a long-overdue expansion of Medicaid, as the state deals with an increasingly dire crisis of rural hospital closures. Gov. Tate Reeves still opposes expansion and has told legislators he\u2019ll veto any bill that reaches his desk.\n\n  * After the Arizona Supreme Court reinstituted a Civil War-era complete ban on abortion, passed before Arizona even became a state, some Republican legislators denounced the ruling \u2014 and then stopped efforts to immediately repeal the law. Abortion rights will be on the ballot in Arizona in November, along with pivotal presidential and U.S. Senate contests and control of the narrowly divided state legislature.\n\n  * A Colorado Senate committee has approved a bill to ban the use of \u201cnonpublic competitor data\u201d to increase rent prices. The House has already passed the bill; a previous version would have banned using algorithms for this purpose entirely.\n\n  * The Maryland legislature passed two bills last weekend that aim to restrict the collection of consumer data and protect children under the age of 18 from manipulative techniques like autoplay videos. Gov. Wes Moore has not taken a public position on the legislation.\n\n####\n\nWhat we\u2019re reading\n\n  * Can the UAW Finally Organize the South? | D.D.
