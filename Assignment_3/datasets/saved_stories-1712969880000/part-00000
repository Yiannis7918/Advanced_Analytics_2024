So Why Is It So Hard to Track Down?\n\nAnalysts spend countless hours and resources compiling the precinct-level\nresults they need for litigation and research. They want legislation to force\nstates to make it all accessible.\n\nDara Gold | April 12, 2024\n\nElection workers are processing ballots in the 2020 presidential election (AP\nPhoto/Mary Altaffer).\n\nApril 12, 2024\n\n### Election Data Is Vital to Voting Rights. So Why Is It So Hard to Track\nDown?\n\nDara Gold\n\nShare\n\nMichael Pernick, a voting rights lawyer at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund,\ndepends on precinct-level election returns to bring many of his lawsuits. He\nneeds that granular data to analyze whether local election rules are having a\nracially discriminatory effect. But New York has no centralized database of\nprecinct results. For local elections, many jurisdictions maintain their own\ndata and often don\u2019t even report it up to their counties, let alone the state.\n\nPractitioners like Pernick need to go town by town, village by village,\ncollecting and cleaning data themselves, often spending hundreds of hours on\nmundane tasks just to get this basic information. That is, if local election\noffices are even willing to provide it in the first place.\n\nSchool districts across New York are especially prone to discrimination\nbecause they often use at-large voting systems that can marginalize residents\nof color, Pernick explained. But the lack of accessible data poses obstacles\nto investigating them. \u201cThere\u2019s something like 700 school districts across New\nYork and the only way to do an analysis of those school districts is to go\none-at-a-time and send an open records request to each one,\u201d Pernick told\nBolts. \u201cThere could be confusion and delay in responding to requests that\ncould push back even the beginning of an investigation by months.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause of these challenges in identifying and gathering data, we knew that\nin some jurisdictions where there is racial discrimination in voting, it would\nbe difficult or even impossible to prove it,\u201d he added.\n\nPerry Grossman, director of voting rights at the New York Civil Liberties\nUnion, shares Pernick\u2019s frustration at the countless hours his team has poured\ninto data gathering, often dealing with resistant or unresponsive local\noffices. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to threaten to sue counties to get this data,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\nThe New York Senate passed legislation in January that would mandate a\ncentralized state election database that anyone could access. But the bill has\nsince languished in the Assembly, leaving its champions anxious that the\nproblems may endure well past the next round of elections this fall.\n\nAnd the problem extends far beyond New York. Precinct-level election data\nunderpins a world of election analyses. It\u2019s a foundation for Voting Rights\nAct lawsuits throughout the country. Proving how badly maps are gerrymandered\nis impossible without this data, since it\u2019s needed to assess districts\u2019\npartisanship. It\u2019s also used to make all sorts of maps, graphics and tools of\nneighborhood partisan trends. And combining precinct partisanship data with\ndemographic, geographic and income data is used to address a wide range of\npolitical science questions, including showing that voter fraud claims in the\n2020 election were unfounded.\n\nYet there is no entity in the United States that records election returns or\nmaintains boundary maps for the country\u2019s 180,000 precincts. Many states don\u2019t\neven provide this data for the full collection of precincts within their\nborders. Instead, universities, newsrooms, nonprofits and volunteers\ncollectively spend thousands of hours after every major election gathering it\nthemselves.\n\nIt\u2019s a Herculean task for organizations that are often short on time and\nresources, and leaves the people who need precinct data at the mercy of\nindividual county or local election offices whose data quality varies\ndrastically. It also burdens underfunded election officials who are inundated\nwith repeated requests for the same data.\n\nSome states make this process a lot easier than others. For example,\nMinnesota\u2019s secretary of state\u2019s office posts the entire state\u2019s precinct-\nlevel election results together on its website; it also provides digital maps\nof precinct boundaries, called shapefiles.\n\nThe variation between states was captured in dramatic visual form in a project\npublished by The New York Times after the 2020 election. A team of\njournalists, data scientists, and developers set out to produce a map of U.S.\nprecincts, color-coded by how each voted.\n\nFour states on the map\u2014Alabama, Alaska, Louisiana, and Virginia\u2014are completely\nblank, as are large swaths of Idaho, Missouri, Kentucky, and Louisiana.\n\nIt took The Times three months of full-time data and software development work\nto assemble the data after the election, plus months of preparation ahead of\nelection night, according to Miles Watkins, who helped manage the project. \u201cAs\nof when we published the nationwide map, I feel pretty confident that we were\nusing every single piece of open data or FOIA-able information that we could,\u201d\nhe told Bolts. But even with that effort, one of the best-staffed publications\nin the nation wasn\u2019t able to obtain the data to complete the map.\n\nUltimately, over 10 percent of all votes cast in the election weren\u2019t pictured\nin the map.\n\nOne problem that proved intractable was that some counties report a\ncombination of their mail-in, early, and provisional ballots as one lump\ntotal, rather than distributing them based on where voters reside at the\nprecinct-level. This practice prevents analyses of voting patterns at a more\ngranular level, as was the case in the four completely blank states in The\nTimes\u2019 map.\n\nZach Mahafza, an analyst at the Southern Poverty Law Center who investigates\nvoting rights violations in the South, says this lack of precinct data often\nstalls his efforts. In 2021, he was part of a team looking into the city\ncouncil map of Mobile, Alabama. The 2020 Census showed that Mobile was\nmajority-Black. But there were only three majority-Black districts in their\nseven-district city council map. Stand Up Mobile, a local voting rights\norganization, enlisted Mahafza and the SPLC to see whether a new council map\ncould be drawn with at least four majority-Black districts where Black\nresidents would have a meaningful opportunity to elect their preferred\ncandidate. They needed precinct level election returns and precinct maps for\nthe project.\n\nThe city of Mobile provided maps in PDF format, forcing Mahafza to jump\nthrough various hoops to extract reliable data. \u201cWe\u2019d have a zoom-in of this\nprecinct in the northern part of the city, and another precinct in the\nsouthern part of the city and trying to weave all that back together got very\ndifficult,\u201d he said. He estimated that recreating the city\u2019s maps took him 80\nto 85 hours.\n\nUltimately Mahafza\u2019s team showed that it was indeed possible to draw such a\nmap; they warned local leaders that they may violate the VRA if they failed to\nensure that Black voters were fairly represented when they redistricted the\nmap. The city eventually adopted a map that has four districts with voting age\npopulations that are over 53 percent Black.\n\nTo show that a map or election system violates the VRA\u2019s ban on racial\ndiscrimination, plaintiffs must demonstrate several features about their\njurisdiction, including racial polarization among voters; that is, whether\ndifferent racial groups actually prefer different candidates. Practitioners\nconduct these analyses by looking at the demographic makeup and election\nreturns of individual precincts and inferring the voting preferences of\ndifferent populations. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have precinct-level election returns, you\nhave no way to show racially polarized voting,\u201d Ruth Greenwood, director of\nthe Election Law Clinic at Harvard Law School, told Bolts.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t enforce the federal or any state voting rights act if we didn\u2019t\nhave precinct-level data,\u201d Greenwood added.\n\nIn the absence of centralized information, a number of organizations have\ncropped up to fill the gap. OpenElections, a volunteer group of journalists\nand software developers, the Voting and Election Science Team from the\nUniversity of Florida and Wichita State University, the Redistricting Data Hub\nand the MIT Election Lab have all poured resources into collecting,\nstandardizing and publishing precinct-level election results or compiling\nprecinct shapefile maps.\n\nAfter the 2020 presidential election, while The Times was embarking on their\nnationwide precinct map, the MIT Election Lab set out to make its own database\nof the country\u2019s precinct results. It took a dozen computer scientists and\npolitical scientists nearly two years to complete this project\u2014just in time to\nstart over again after the 2022 midterms. Only about 10 states had data\norganized enough to put in their database without much work. For the remaining\nstates, they wrote code to clean data, called county offices to get returns\nthat weren\u2019t posted online, used Optical Character Recognition software to\nread election returns from PDF files and other images and designed quality\ncontrol processes to check their work.\n\nThey even found the precinct-level results of a recount in Idaho\u2019s Bonner\nCounty from a newspaper picture of numbers written on a whiteboard, recalled\nSamuel Baltz, a research scientist in the group.\n\nTired of hitting a wall after every election cycle, some researchers and\nlawyers are pushing for reform, demanding that states clean up and post\ncomplete precinct-level data in accessible formats.\n\nIn early 2018, Kansas data scientist Peter Karman emailed his state\nrepresentative, Boog Highberger, with just such a proposal. He had just spent\nmonths trying to compile the state\u2019s precinct data by calling county offices,\nwrangling it out of PDF files and tediously matching precinct names between\ndigital maps and spreadsheets. He thought the Kansas secretary of state\u2019s\noffice should be required to publish the data on its website.\n\nHighberger initiated a bill to address these issues, and Karman provided\ntestimony in both chambers. He even included requests for data formatting:\n\u201cpublish the spreadsheet as a spreadsheet, not as a picture of a spreadsheet,\u201d\nhe implored. Within four months, Karman stood by as Governor Jeff Colyer\nsigned legislation that required the secretary of state\u2019s office to post\nprecinct-level data on its website for all federal, statewide, and legislative\nraces within 30 days of the final election canvass.\n\nMore recently, Connecticut mandated a statewide elections database as part of\nits new Voting Rights Act; the broader legislation is part of a multistate\neffort to reproduce voting rights protections that federal courts have eroded.\nPernick, the Legal Defense Fund lawyer, said the law\u2019s database component was\nmodeled after the legislative proposal in New York.\n\nThe New York bill, which Pernick and Grossman helped draft, would establish a\nstatewide database that would house centralized election data and shapefiles\nfor the entire state, down to the precinct level. Sponsored by Senator Zellnor\nMyrie, the proposal first passed the Senate in 2022, but didn\u2019t receive a\nhearing in the state Assembly by the end of that legislative session.\n\nThe reform\u2019s latest version, Senate Bill S657A, is in danger of suffering the\nsame fate, having passed the state\u2019s upper-chamber in January but now stuck\nagain in the House Election Law Committee. The committee is chaired by Latrice\nWalker, who is also a sponsor of the bill. Myrie and Walker did not return a\nrequest for comment.\n\nIn the meantime, people who want New York precinct data have been left to\ntheir own devices, compiling the data on their own. Ben Rosenblatt, an\nindependent New York political consultant who has worked on Democratic\ncampaigns in the state, decided to cobble together a statewide precinct\nshapefile in 2022. He posted his progress on Twitter as he went, announcing it\nwas complete in December 2023 after a year of gathering and cleaning data from\neach of New York\u2019s 62 counties. The Times\u2019 2020 mapping project cites\nRosenblatt\u2019s work as its only New York data source.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to do it again this year for 2024,\u201d Rosenblatt told Bolts.\n\nBills with similar provisions have been introduced in Michigan and New Jersey.\nFlorida\u2019s and Maryland\u2019s versions did not move forward by the end of this\nyear\u2019s legislative sessions.\n\nIf this type of regulation existed in every state, with each state cleaning\nand posting their own precinct data in accessible formats, the resources spent\non this task by outside groups would change drastically, if not cease\naltogether.\n\nBolts asked Watkins how long his team would have needed to complete the data\nfor The Times\u2019 mapping project under these conditions. It probably would have\ntaken \u201ca few days,\u201d he said. He paused to reflect and then added, \u201cMaybe one\nweek.\u201d\n\n## Stay up-to-date\n\nSign up for our newsletter\n\n## Support us\n\nBolts is a non-profit newsroom that relies on donations, and it takes\nresources to produce this work.
