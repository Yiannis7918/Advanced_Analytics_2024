For the time zone that lies between UTC\u22121 and UTC+1, see\nUTC+00:00. For other uses, see UTC (disambiguation).\n\nCurrent time zones\n\nCoordinated Universal Time or UTC is the primary time standard globally used\nto regulate clocks and time. It establishes a reference for the current time,\nforming the basis for civil time and time zones. UTC facilitates international\ncommunication, navigation, scientific research, and commerce.\n\nUTC has been widely embraced by most countries and is the effective successor\nto Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) in everyday usage and common applications.^[1] In\nspecialized domains such as scientific research, navigation, and timekeeping,\nother standards such as UT1 and International Atomic Time (TAI) are also used\nalongside UTC.\n\nUTC is based on TAI, which is a weighted average of hundreds of atomic clocks\nworldwide. UTC is within about one second of mean solar time at 0\u00b0 longitude,\nthe currently used prime meridian, and is not adjusted for daylight saving\ntime.\n\nThe coordination of time and frequency transmissions around the world began on\n1 January 1960. UTC was first officially adopted as a standard in 1963 and\n\"UTC\" became the official abbreviation of Coordinated Universal Time in\n1967.^[2] The current version of UTC is defined by the International\nTelecommunication Union.\n\nSince adoption, UTC has been adjusted several times, notably adding leap\nseconds in 1972. Recent years have seen significant developments in the realm\nof UTC, particularly in discussions about eliminating leap seconds from the\ntimekeeping system because leap seconds occasionally disrupt timekeeping\nsystems worldwide. The General Conference on Weights and Measures adopted a\nresolution to alter UTC with a new system that would eliminate leap seconds by\n2035.^[3]\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\nThe official abbreviation for Coordinated Universal Time is UTC. This\nabbreviation comes as a result of the International Telecommunication Union\nand the International Astronomical Union wanting to use the same abbreviation\nin all languages.^[4] The compromise that emerged was UTC,^[5] which conforms\nto the pattern for the abbreviations of the variants of Universal Time (UT0,\nUT1, UT2, UT1R, etc.).^[6]\n\nMcCarthy described the origin of the abbreviation:\n\n> In 1967 the CCIR adopted the names Coordinated Universal Time and Temps\n> Universel Coordonn\u00e9 for the English and French names with the acronym UTC to\n> be used in both languages. The name \"Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)\" was\n> approved by a resolution of IAU Commissions 4 and 31 at the 13th General\n> Assembly in 1967 (Trans. IAU, 1968).^[2]\n\n## Uses[edit]\n\nTime zones around the world are expressed using positive or negative offsets\nfrom UTC, as in the list of time zones by UTC offset.\n\nThe westernmost time zone uses UTC\u221212, being twelve hours behind UTC; the\neasternmost time zone uses UTC+14, being fourteen hours ahead of UTC. In 1995,\nthe island nation of Kiribati moved those of its atolls in the Line Islands\nfrom UTC\u221210 to UTC+14 so that Kiribati would all be on the same day.\n\nUTC is used in many Internet and World Wide Web standards. The Network Time\nProtocol (NTP), designed to synchronise the clocks of computers over the\nInternet, transmits time information from the UTC system.^[7] If only\nmilliseconds precision is needed, clients can obtain the current UTC from a\nnumber of official internet UTC servers. For sub-microsecond precision,\nclients can obtain the time from satellite signals.\n\nUTC is also the time standard used in aviation,^[8] e.g. for flight plans and\nair traffic control. In this context it is frequently referred to as Zulu\ntime, as described below. Weather forecasts and maps all use UTC to avoid\nconfusion about time zones and daylight saving time. The International Space\nStation also uses UTC as a time standard.\n\nAmateur radio operators often schedule their radio contacts in UTC, because\ntransmissions on some frequencies can be picked up in many time zones.^[9]\n\n## Mechanism[edit]\n\nUTC divides time into days, hours, minutes, and seconds. Days are\nconventionally identified using the Gregorian calendar, but Julian day numbers\ncan also be used. Each day contains 24 hours and each hour contains 60\nminutes. The number of seconds in a minute is usually 60, but with an\noccasional leap second, it may be 61 or 59 instead.^[10] Thus, in the UTC time\nscale, the second and all smaller time units (millisecond, microsecond, etc.)\nare of constant duration, but the minute and all larger time units (hour, day,\nweek, etc.) are of variable duration. Decisions to introduce a leap second are\nannounced at least six months in advance in \"Bulletin C\" produced by the\nInternational Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service.^[11]^[12] The leap\nseconds cannot be predicted far in advance due to the unpredictable rate of\nthe rotation of Earth.^[13]\n\nNearly all UTC days contain exactly 86,400 SI seconds with exactly 60 seconds\nin each minute. UTC is within about one second of mean solar time (such as\nUT1) at 0\u00b0 longitude,^[14] (at the IERS Reference Meridian). The mean solar\nday is slightly longer than 86,400 SI seconds so occasionally the last minute\nof a UTC day is adjusted to have 61 seconds. The extra second is called a leap\nsecond. It accounts for the grand total of the extra length (about 2\nmilliseconds each) of all the mean solar days since the previous leap second.\nThe last minute of a UTC day is permitted to contain 59 seconds to cover the\nremote possibility of the Earth rotating faster, but that has not yet been\nnecessary. The irregular day lengths mean fractional Julian days do not work\nproperly with UTC.\n\nSince 1972, UTC may be calculated by subtracting the accumulated leap seconds\nfrom International Atomic Time (TAI), which is a coordinate time scale\ntracking notional proper time on the rotating surface of the Earth (the\ngeoid). In order to maintain a close approximation to UT1, UTC occasionally\nhas discontinuities where it changes from one linear function of TAI to\nanother. These discontinuities take the form of leap seconds implemented by a\nUTC day of irregular length. Discontinuities in UTC occurred only at the end\nof June or December. However, there is provision for them to happen at the end\nof March and September as well as a second preference.^[15]^[16] The\nInternational Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) tracks and\npublishes the difference between UTC and Universal Time, DUT1 = UT1 \u2212 UTC, and\nintroduces discontinuities into UTC to keep DUT1 in the interval (\u22120.9 s, +0.9\ns).\n\nAs with TAI, UTC is only known with the highest precision in retrospect. Users\nwho require an approximation in real time must obtain it from a time\nlaboratory, which disseminates an approximation using techniques such as GPS\nor radio time signals. Such approximations are designated UTC(k), where k is\nan abbreviation for the time laboratory.^[17] The time of events may be\nprovisionally recorded against one of these approximations; later corrections\nmay be applied using the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM)\nmonthly publication of tables of differences between canonical TAI/UTC and\nTAI(k)/UTC(k) as estimated in real-time by participating laboratories.^[18]\n(See the article on International Atomic Time for details.)\n\nBecause of time dilation, a standard clock not on the geoid, or in rapid\nmotion, will not maintain synchronicity with UTC. Therefore, telemetry from\nclocks with a known relation to the geoid is used to provide UTC when\nrequired, on locations such as those of spacecraft.\n\nIt is impossible to compute the exact time interval elapsed between two UTC\ntimestamps without consulting a table showing how many leap seconds occurred\nduring that interval. By extension, it is not possible to compute the precise\nduration of a time interval that ends in the future and may encompass an\nunknown number of leap seconds (for example, the number of TAI seconds between\n\"now\" and 2099-12-31 23:59:59). Therefore, many scientific applications that\nrequire precise measurement of long (multi-year) intervals use TAI instead.\nTAI is also commonly used by systems that cannot handle leap seconds. GPS time\nalways remains exactly 19 seconds behind TAI (neither system is affected by\nthe leap seconds introduced in UTC).\n\n### Time zones[edit]\n\nMain articles: Time zone and Lists of time zones\n\nSee also: UTC offset and List of UTC time offsets\n\n\"Zulu time\" redirects here. For the album by Caspar Br\u00f6tzmann and Page\nHamilton, see Zulutime. For the time zone of the Zulu people, see South\nAfrican Standard Time.\n\nTime zones are usually defined as differing from UTC by an integer number of\nhours,^[19] although the laws of each jurisdiction would have to be consulted\nif sub-second accuracy was required. Several jurisdictions have established\ntime zones that differ by an odd integer number of half-hours or quarter-hours\nfrom UT1 or UTC.\n\nCurrent civil time in a particular time zone can be determined by adding or\nsubtracting the number of hours and minutes specified by the UTC offset, which\nranges from UTC\u221212:00 in the west to UTC+14:00 in the east (see List of UTC\noffsets).\n\nThe time zone using UTC is sometimes denoted UTC\u00b100:00 or by the letter Z\u2014a\nreference to the equivalent nautical time zone (GMT), which has been denoted\nby a Z since about 1950. Time zones were identified by successive letters of\nthe alphabet and the Greenwich time zone was marked by a Z as it was the point\nof origin. The letter also refers to the \"zone description\" of zero hours,\nwhich has been used since 1920 (see time zone history). Since the NATO\nphonetic alphabet word for Z is \"Zulu\", UTC is sometimes known as \"Zulu time\".\nThis is especially true in aviation, where \"Zulu\" is the universal\nstandard.^[20] This ensures that all pilots, regardless of location, are using\nthe same 24-hour clock, thus avoiding confusion when flying between time\nzones.^[21] See the list of military time zones for letters used in addition\nto Z in qualifying time zones other than Greenwich.\n\nOn electronic devices which only allow the time zone to be configured using\nmaps or city names, UTC can be selected indirectly by selecting cities such as\nAccra in Ghana or Reykjav\u00edk in Iceland as they are always on UTC and do not\ncurrently use daylight saving time (which Greenwich and London do, and so\ncould be a source of error).^[22]\n\n### Daylight saving time[edit]\n\nMain article: Daylight saving time\n\nUTC does not change with a change of seasons, but local time or civil time may\nchange if a time zone jurisdiction observes daylight saving time (summer\ntime). For example, local time on the east coast of the United States is five\nhours behind UTC during winter,^[23] but four hours behind while daylight\nsaving is observed there.^[24]\n\n## History[edit]\n\nFurther information: Universal time \u00a7 History\n\nIn 1928, the term Universal Time (UT) was introduced by the International\nAstronomical Union to refer to GMT, with the day starting at midnight.^[25]\nUntil the 1950s, broadcast time signals were based on UT, and hence on the\nrotation of the Earth.\n\nIn 1955, the caesium atomic clock was invented. This provided a form of\ntimekeeping that was both more stable and more convenient than astronomical\nobservations. In 1956, the U.S. National Bureau of Standards and U.S. Naval\nObservatory started to develop atomic frequency time scales; by 1959, these\ntime scales were used in generating the WWV time signals, named for the\nshortwave radio station that broadcasts them. In 1960, the U.S. Naval\nObservatory, the Royal Greenwich Observatory, and the UK National Physical\nLaboratory coordinated their radio broadcasts so that time steps and frequency\nchanges were coordinated, and the resulting time scale was informally referred\nto as \"Coordinated Universal Time\".^[26]^[27]\n\nIn a controversial decision, the frequency of the signals was initially set to\nmatch the rate of UT, but then kept at the same frequency by the use of atomic\nclocks and deliberately allowed to drift away from UT. When the divergence\ngrew significantly, the signal was phase shifted (stepped) by 20 ms to bring\nit back into agreement with UT. Twenty-nine such steps were used before\n1960.^[28]\n\nIn 1958, data was published linking the frequency for the caesium transition,\nnewly established, with the ephemeris second. The ephemeris second is a unit\nin the system of time that, when used as the independent variable in the laws\nof motion that govern the movement of the planets and moons in the solar\nsystem, enables the laws of motion to accurately predict the observed\npositions of solar system bodies. Within the limits of observable accuracy,\nephemeris seconds are of constant length, as are atomic seconds. This\npublication allowed a value to be chosen for the length of the atomic second\nthat would accord with the celestial laws of motion.^[29]\n\nThe coordination of time and frequency transmissions around the world began on\n1 January 1960. UTC was first officially adopted in 1963 as CCIR\nRecommendation 374, Standard-Frequency and Time-Signal Emissions, and \"UTC\"\nbecame the official abbreviation of Coordinated Universal Time in 1967.^[2]\n\nIn 1961, the Bureau International de l'Heure began coordinating the UTC\nprocess internationally (but the name Coordinated Universal Time was not\nformally adopted by the International Astronomical Union until\n1967).^[30]^[31] From then on, there were time steps every few months, and\nfrequency changes at the end of each year. The jumps increased in size to 0.1\nseconds. This UTC was intended to permit a very close approximation to\nUT2.^[26]\n\nIn 1967, the SI second was redefined in terms of the frequency supplied by a\ncaesium atomic clock. The length of second so defined was practically equal to\nthe second of ephemeris time.^[32] This was the frequency that had been\nprovisionally used in TAI since 1958. It was soon decided that having two\ntypes of second with different lengths, namely the UTC second and the SI\nsecond used in TAI, was a bad idea. It was thought better for time signals to\nmaintain a consistent frequency, and that this frequency should match the SI\nsecond. Thus it would be necessary to rely on time steps alone to maintain the\napproximation of UT. This was tried experimentally in a service known as\n\"Stepped Atomic Time\" (SAT), which ticked at the same rate as TAI and used\njumps of 0.2 seconds to stay synchronised with UT2.^[33]\n\nThere was also dissatisfaction with the frequent jumps in UTC (and SAT). In\n1968, Louis Essen, the inventor of the caesium atomic clock, and G. M. R.\nWinkler both independently proposed that steps should be of 1 second\nonly.^[34] to simplify future adjustments. This system was eventually approved\nas leap seconds in a new UTC in 1970 and implemented in 1972, along with the\nidea of maintaining the UTC second equal to the TAI second. This CCIR\nRecommendation 460 \"stated that (a) carrier frequencies and time intervals\nshould be maintained constant and should correspond to the definition of the\nSI second; (b) step adjustments, when necessary, should be exactly 1 s to\nmaintain approximate agreement with Universal Time (UT); and (c) standard\nsignals should contain information on the difference between UTC and UT.\"^[35]\n\nAs an intermediate step at the end of 1971, there was a final irregular jump\nof exactly 0.107758 TAI seconds, making the total of all the small time steps\nand frequency shifts in UTC or TAI during 1958\u20131971 exactly ten seconds, so\nthat 1 January 1972 00:00:00 UTC was 1 January 1972 00:00:10 TAI exactly,^[36]\nand a whole number of seconds thereafter. At the same time, the tick rate of\nUTC was changed to exactly match TAI. UTC also started to track UT1 rather\nthan UT2. Some time signals started to broadcast the DUT1 correction (UT1 \u2212\nUTC) for applications requiring a closer approximation of UT1 than UTC now\nprovided.^[37]^[38]\n\nThe current version of UTC is defined by International Telecommunication Union\nRecommendation (ITU-R TF.460-6), Standard-frequency and time-signal\nemissions,^[39] and is based on International Atomic Time (TAI) with leap\nseconds added at irregular intervals to compensate for the accumulated\ndifference between TAI and time measured by Earth's rotation.^[40] Leap\nseconds are inserted as necessary to keep UTC within 0.9 seconds of the UT1\nvariant of universal time.^[41] See the \"Current number of leap seconds\"\nsection for the number of leap seconds inserted to date.\n\n### Current number of leap seconds[edit]\n\nThe first leap second occurred on 30 June 1972. Since then, leap seconds have\noccurred on average about once every 19 months, always on 30 June or 31\nDecember. As of July 2022^[update], there have been 27 leap seconds in total,\nall positive, putting UTC 37 seconds behind TAI.^[42]\n\nA study published in March 2024 in Nature concluded that accelerated melting\nof ice in Greenland and Antarctica due to climate change has decreased Earth's\nrotational velocity, affecting UTC adjustments and causing problems for\ncomputer networks that rely on UTC.^[43]\n\n## Rationale[edit]\n\nGraph showing the difference DUT1 between UT1 and UTC (in seconds). Vertical\nsegments correspond to leap seconds.\n\nEarth's rotational speed is very slowly decreasing because of tidal\ndeceleration; this increases the length of the mean solar day. The length of\nthe SI second was calibrated on the basis of the second of ephemeris\ntime^[29]^[32] and can now be seen to have a relationship with the mean solar\nday observed between 1750 and 1892, analysed by Simon Newcomb. As a result,\nthe SI second is close to 1/86400 of a mean solar day in the mid\u201019th\ncentury.^[44] In earlier centuries, the mean solar day was shorter than 86,400\nSI seconds, and in more recent centuries it is longer than 86,400 seconds.\nNear the end of the 20th century, the length of the mean solar day (also known\nsimply as \"length of day\" or \"LOD\") was approximately 86,400.0013 s.^[45] For\nthis reason, UT is now \"slower\" than TAI by the difference (or \"excess\" LOD)\nof 1.3 ms/day.\n\nThe excess of the LOD over the nominal 86,400 s accumulates over time, causing\nthe UTC day, initially synchronised with the mean sun, to become\ndesynchronised and run ahead of it. Near the end of the 20th century, with the\nLOD at 1.3 ms above the nominal value, UTC ran faster than UT by 1.3 ms per\nday, getting a second ahead roughly every 800 days. Thus, leap seconds were\ninserted at approximately this interval, retarding UTC to keep it synchronised\nin the long term.^[46] The actual rotational period varies on unpredictable\nfactors such as tectonic motion and has to be observed, rather than computed.\n\nJust as adding a leap day every four years does not mean the year is getting\nlonger by one day every four years, the insertion of a leap second every 800\ndays does not indicate that the mean solar day is getting longer by a second\nevery 800 days. It will take about 50,000 years for a mean solar day to\nlengthen by one second (at a rate of 2 ms per century). This rate fluctuates\nwithin the range of 1.7\u20132.3 ms/cy. While the rate due to tidal friction alone\nis about 2.3 ms/cy, the uplift of Canada and Scandinavia by several metres\nsince the last ice age has temporarily reduced this to 1.7 ms/cy over the last\n2,700 years.^[47] The correct reason for leap seconds, then, is not the\ncurrent difference between actual and nominal LOD, but rather the accumulation\nof this difference over a period of time: Near the end of the 20th century,\nthis difference was about 1/800 of a second per day; therefore, after about\n800 days, it accumulated to 1 second (and a leap second was then added).\n\nIn the graph of DUT1 above, the excess of LOD above the nominal 86,400 s\ncorresponds to the downward slope of the graph between vertical segments. (The\nslope became shallower in the 1980s, 2000s and late 2010s to 2020s because of\nslight accelerations of Earth's rotation temporarily shortening the day.)\nVertical position on the graph corresponds to the accumulation of this\ndifference over time, and the vertical segments correspond to leap seconds\nintroduced to match this accumulated difference. Leap seconds are timed to\nkeep DUT1 within the vertical range depicted by the adjacent graph. The\nfrequency of leap seconds therefore corresponds to the slope of the diagonal\ngraph segments, and thus to the excess LOD. Time periods when the slope\nreverses direction (slopes upwards, not the vertical segments) are times when\nthe excess LOD is negative, that is, when the LOD is below 86,400 s.\n\n## Future[edit]\n\nSee also: Leap second\n\nAs the Earth's rotation continues to slow, positive leap seconds will be\nrequired more frequently. The long-term rate of change of LOD is approximately\n+1.7 ms per century. At the end of the 21st century, LOD will be roughly\n86,400.004 s, requiring leap seconds every 250 days. Over several centuries,\nthe frequency of leap seconds will become problematic.^[48] A change in the\ntrend of the UT1 \u2013 UTC values was seen beginning around June 2019 in which\ninstead of slowing down (with leap seconds to keep the difference between UT1\nand UTC less than 0.9 seconds) the Earth's rotation has sped up, causing this\ndifference to increase. If the trend continues, a negative leap second may be\nrequired, which has not been used before. This may not be needed until\n2025.^[49]^[50]\n\nSome time in the 22nd century, two leap seconds will be required every year.\nThe current practice of only allowing leap seconds in June and December will\nbe insufficient to maintain a difference of less than 1 second, and it might\nbe decided to introduce leap seconds in March and September. In the 25th\ncentury, four leap seconds are projected to be required every year, so the\ncurrent quarterly options would be insufficient.\n\nIn April 2001, Rob Seaman of the National Optical Astronomy Observatory\nproposed that leap seconds be allowed to be added monthly rather than twice\nyearly.^[51]\n\nIn 2022 a resolution was adopted by the General Conference on Weights and\nMeasures to redefine UTC and abolish leap seconds, but keep the civil second\nconstant and equal to the SI second, so that sundials would slowly get further\nand further out of sync with civil time. The leap seconds will be eliminated\nby 2035. The resolution does not break the connection between UTC and UT1, but\nincreases the maximum allowable difference. The details of what the maximum\ndifference will be and how corrections will be implemented is left for future\ndiscussions.^[3] This will result in a shift of the sun's movements relative\nto civil time, with the difference increasing quadratically with time (i.e.,\nproportional to elapsed centuries squared). This is analogous to the shift of\nseasons relative to the yearly calendar that results from the calendar year\nnot precisely matching the tropical year length. This would be a change in\ncivil timekeeping, and would have a slow effect at first, but becoming drastic\nover several centuries. UTC (and TAI) would be more and more ahead of UT; it\nwould coincide with local mean time along a meridian drifting eastward faster\nand faster.^[52] Thus, the time system will lose its fixed connection to the\ngeographic coordinates based on the IERS meridian. The difference between UTC\nand UT would reach 0.5 hours after the year 2600 and 6.5 hours around\n4600.^[53]\n\nITU\u2010R Study Group 7 and Working Party 7A were unable to reach consensus on\nwhether to advance the proposal to the 2012 Radiocommunications Assembly; the\nchairman of Study Group 7 elected to advance the question to the 2012\nRadiocommunications Assembly (20 January 2012),^[54] but consideration of the\nproposal was postponed by the ITU until the World Radio Conference in\n2015.^[55] This conference, in turn, considered the question,^[56] but no\npermanent decision was reached; it only chose to engage in further study with\nthe goal of reconsideration in 2023.^[57] ^[needs update]\n\nA proposed alternative to the leap second is the leap hour or leap minute,\nwhich requires changes only once every few centuries.^[58]\n\nITU World Radiocommunication Conference 2023 (WRC-23), which was held in Dubai\n(United Arab Emirates) from 20 November to 15 December 2023 formally\nrecognized the Resolution 4 of the 27th CGPM (2022) which decides that the\nmaximum value for the difference (UT1-UTC) will be increased in, or before,\n2035.^[59]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Geography portal\n\n  * Coordinated Mars Time (MTC)\n  * Ephemeris time\n  * IERS Reference Meridian\n  * ISO 8601\n  * List of UTC timing centers\n  * Terrestrial Time\n  * Universal Time\n  * World Radiocommunication Conference\n  * Coordinated Lunar Time\n\n## References[edit]\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Evers, Liz (2013).
