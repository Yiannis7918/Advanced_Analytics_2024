He created the film in 2016 to\nprotest against film censorship in the United Kingdom and the sometimes-\nprohibitive cost to independent filmmakers which the British Board of Film\nClassification's (BBFC) classification requirement imposes. The film consists\nof 607 minutes (10 hours and 7 minutes) of a static view of white paint drying\non a brick wall. Shackleton made the film to force the BBFC to watch all ten\nhours to give the film an age rating classification. He initially shot 14\nhours' worth of footage of paint drying in 4K resolution and opened a\nKickstarter campaign to pay the BBFC's per-minute rate for a film as long as\npossible. It raised \u00a35,936 from 686 backers. After reviewing the film, the\nBBFC rated it 'U' for 'Universal', indicating \"no material likely to offend or\nharm\".^[2] Paint Drying had its first public screening at the Queensland Art\nGallery and Gallery of Modern Art in Brisbane, Australia, between 10\u201329\nNovember 2023 as part of the Cinema Obstructed film exhibition\u2014for which\nShackleton was co-curator.\n\n## Synopsis[edit]\n\nA non-narrative film, Paint Drying consists of 607 minutes (10 hours and 7\nminutes) of a static view of white paint drying on a brick wall. The entire\nfilm is a single continuous shot, and there is no audio.^[3]^[4] It receives\nits title from the expression \"like watching paint dry\",^[5] which refers to\nsomething very tedious or boring.^[6]\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n### Background and conception[edit]\n\nShackleton in 2022\n\nCharlie Shackleton (known as Charlie Lyne until 2019)^[7] is a British\nindependent filmmaker. He has written, directed and produced several\nindependent films, such as his essay-style documentary films Beyond Clueless\n(2014)\u2014his directorial debut\u2014and Fear Itself (2015).^[4]^[8] The British Board\nof Film Classification (BBFC) is the authority responsible for the national\nclassification and censorship of films exhibited at cinemas and video works\nreleased on physical media within the United Kingdom. All filmmakers wishing\nto release a film in British cinemas are required to receive a rating from the\nBBFC or exemption from the local authority.^[8]^[9] In 2015, it cost \u00a3101.50\nplus \u00a37.09 per minute of runtime to have a film reviewed by the\nBBFC.^[10]^[11]\n\nPaint Drying is a protest against both film censorship in the UK, and the\nunfair cost to independent filmmakers imposed by the BBFC's mandatory\nclassification requirement.^[5]^[10] According to Shackleton, \"this project\n[Paint Drying] is the culmination of a decade spent aimlessly railing against\nthe BBFC\u2014a decade that began when I was 13 years old\".^[12] Shackleton states\nthat his distaste for the BBFC began when he was reading the trivia section on\nIMDb for the 1999 film Fight Club, and realised that the version he had seen\nwas censored by the BBFC by having six seconds cut to \"reduce the sense of\nsadistic pleasure in inflicting violence\".^[12] Shackleton was dismayed,\nstating \"if we censor art on the basis that someone somewhere might be hurt by\nit, we'll be left with no art at all. Should the 'White Album' be banned\nbecause Charlie Manson used 'Helter Skelter' to justify murder?\"^[12]\n\nIn protest against the BBFC's per-minute rate for film classifications,\nShackleton stated that the average cost of an age classification for\nindependent filmmakers could exceed \u00a31,000, which would prove to be a heavy\nfinancial burden on most independent filmmakers.^[8] According to Shackleton,\nthe BBFC certificate for his debut self-distributed film, Beyond Clueless,\ncost \u00a3867.60, which was roughly fifty per cent of its distribution budget.\nShackleton stated that he knew of several planned cinematic releases from\nindependent filmmakers that had to be abandoned because the cost was too high,\nwhich he added was \"terrible for British film culture\".^[10] He conceived the\nidea to make a film about paint drying while at a filmmaker's event at the\nBBFC in 2015.^[13] He had expected to see conflict between the BBFC examiners\nand the visiting filmmakers, but was surprised that there was no such\ndisagreement; Shackleton added that, on the contrary, many of the attending\nfilmmakers seemed to be supportive of the BBFC.^[14] He also disapproved of\nthe examiners who were discussing the censorship of certain films and the\nrationale behind such action.^[13]\n\n### Filming, editing and Kickstarter campaign[edit]\n\nPaint Drying was made to force the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC)\nto watch all ten hours in order to give the film an age rating classification.\n\nShackleton initially shot 14 hours' worth of footage of white paint drying in\n4K resolution.^[15] He chose the colour white because of its \"certain Tom\nSawyer charm\".^[16] The location of the wall that was painted has not been\ndisclosed.^[13] On 16 November 2015, Shackleton opened a Kickstarter campaign\nto make the film's released length as long as possible.^[17] The funds raised\nwould be put towards the cost of the age classification, the final length of\nthe film being resolute with how much money was raised from the campaign.^[8]\nIt had raised \u00a3961\u2014worth 2 hours and 1 minute of footage\u2014by 18 November, and\nan individual unaffiliated with the campaign created a website that tracked in\nreal time how long Paint Drying would be.^[18] By 20 November, the film had\nraised \u00a33,147, which equated to more than seven hours of footage.^[8] By 23\nNovember, Paint Drying hit \u00a34,000.^[15] Shackleton stated that he would shoot\nmore footage if the Kickstarter campaign raised more than \u00a36,057 (meaning 14\nhours' worth of footage), although ultimately this did not happen.^[10]^[15]\n\nShackleton told The Daily Telegraph that he hoped that crowdfunding a BBFC\nclassification for the film would demonstrate how many people are concerned\nabout film censorship in the UK, adding that the prospect of making the BBFC\nexaminers watch paint dry was humorous.^[8] Shackleton acknowledged that Paint\nDrying would likely not have a large impact on film censorship within the UK,\nbut nevertheless hoped that it would encourage people to debate the practices\nof the BBFC.^[19] He further stated that people accepted the BBFC solely\nbecause of its age, claiming that if a similar organisation were to be founded\ntoday to censor literature or music, there would be public outrage.^[20] The\nKickstarter campaign ended on 31 December 2015, having raised \u00a35,936 from 686\nbackers\u2014equating to 731 minutes (12 hours and 11 minutes) of footage, which\nwas shortened to 10 hours and 7 minutes after Kickstarter's fees and value-\nadded tax.^[4]^[21]\n\nThe campaign also received donations from people outside of the UK, which\nsurprised Shackleton as he thought that non-British individuals would be\nconfused about the BBFC's authority. He concluded that censorship was\nunfortunately a \"pretty universal concept\".^[22] Shackleton also stated that\nfilmmakers from around the world, particularly Australia and India, were\nsupportive of Paint Drying.^[10] Despite suggestions from backers for\nShackleton to secretly insert a penis into a single frame of Paint Drying, he\nultimately decided against it as he believed it would have detracted from the\npoint of the film.^[13]\n\n## Classification[edit]\n\nThe Digital Cinema Package that Shackleton submitted to the BBFC for\nclassification was 310 gigabytes in size.^[23] Due to the length of the film,\nBBFC examiners split their viewing into two sessions over two consecutive\ndays, the majority being viewed on 25 January.^[24] To coincide with the\nexamination, Shackleton held an 'Ask Me Anything' (AMA) question and answer\nsession on the subreddit r/IAmA, during which he stated that he did not\nhimself watch the film in its entirety.^[21] Shackleton's post received\nhundreds of comments within a day and became top post on the subreddit on that\nday.^[25] On 26 January, upon reviewing the film, the BBFC rated it 'U' for\n'Universal,' indicating \"no material likely to offend or harm\".^[2]^[4]^[26]\nAfter receiving a digital copy of the certificate, Shackleton tweeted that it\nwas \"\u00a35,936 well spent\".^[27]\n\nIn response to the protest, the BBFC said it would classify the film as it\nwould any other submission. It added that \"The BBFC is a non-profit\norganisation that works to protect children, from content which might raise\nharm risks and to empower the public, especially parents, to make informed\nviewing choices. It implements Classification Guidelines that reflect changing\nsocial attitudes towards media content through proactive public consultation\nand research.\"^[4] The BBFC also noted that its only source of income is the\ncharges for its services.^[4]^[28] Paint Drying is not the longest film to\nhave been rated by the BBFC\u2014the French film Out 1 (1971) is 773 minutes (12\nhours, 55 minutes) long, and was classified by the BBFC in 2015. They rated it\n15 for \"very strong language\".^[4]^[29]\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\nAlthough the film likely did not have any influence on the BBFC's governing,\nthe novel idea of the film and arguments raised by Shackleton have since been\nfrequently discussed in the context of film censorship and\nclassification.^[30]^[31] After the film was first classified by the BBFC, the\nA.V. Club said that a \"14-hour director's cut is presumably forthcoming\",^[32]\nand Gizmodo AU stated that uploading the film onto YouTube would be an ideal\nplace for its \"cinematic brilliance\" to be permanently available for anyone to\nview.^[23] British magazine Dazed said that if Shackleton had allowed Paint\nDrying to be shown in cinemas, it would have been a great way to prank one's\nsignificant other on Valentine's Day.^[13] In the September 2016 issue of\nAlive, D.P. Sabharwal called the film \"a novel and innovative protest\".^[33]\nIn an April 2017 opinion piece by National Post praising Shackleton's work,\nCalum Marsh declared Paint Drying a comedy and praised Shackleton's dedication\nto creating the film. Marsh stated that he was unsure about its merit as a\nfilm, but stated that as a comedy, \"it's very, very good\".^[34]\n\nOn 1 March 2016, Paint Drying was the subject of a video essay by the French\nseries Blow Up [fr], broadcast by Arte. In it, presenter Luc Lagier positively\ncompares the film to Wavelength (1967), a structural film that consists of a\ngradually zooming-in shot of a room.^[35] Shackleton reflected on Paint Drying\nin an article he wrote for Vice in April 2017, in which he stated that the\nBBFC remained unchanged since his protest, and \"continues to ban films\noutright\".^[36] On 15 October 2018, Paint Drying was featured in an episode of\nseries P of the British panel show QI.^[37] In 2022, academic Arina Pismenny\nreferred to Paint Drying as an example of art that was objectively boring yet\ninteresting given its context.^[38]\n\n## Release[edit]\n\nAlthough Shackleton had no plans for a wide theatrical release, he stated on\n25 January 2016 that he was in talks with a cinema in London about possibly\nshowing the film.^[23]^[25] Shackleton planned for it to be followed by a\npublic debate regarding film censorship.^[39] He later added that \"it would\ntake some working out, [in terms of] how to show it. I can't imagine that many\npeople would make it through the entire duration\", stating that it would have\nto be shown in a setting that could allow for people to walk in and out of the\ntheatre.^[40] Ultimately, Paint Drying had its first public screening at the\nQueensland Art Gallery and Gallery of Modern Art in Brisbane, Australia,\nbetween 10\u201329 November 2023. It screened at the Gallery of Modern Art & Cinema\nbuilding as part of the Cinema Obstructed artistic film exhibition, for which\nShackleton was a co-curator alongside Australian-native Robert Hughes.^[41]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * List of longest films\n  * Paracinema\n  * Satire film\n\n## References[edit]\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"Paint Drying\".
