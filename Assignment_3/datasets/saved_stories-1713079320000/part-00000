Browse the archive here.\n\nHi all, Tara here, The Markup\u2019s education reporter. I\u2019m here to tell you about\na package of stories we published this morning about internet censorship in\nschools, and, also, to give you a behind-the-scenes look at how this\ninvestigation came together.\n\nDigital Book Banning\n\n### Schools Were Just Supposed To Block Porn. Instead They Sabotaged Homework\nand Censored Suicide Prevention Sites\n\nThe Trevor Project? Blocked. Planned Parenthood? Blocked. NASA? BLOCKED\n\nApril 13, 2024 06:00 ET\n\nFirst, let\u2019s talk about why this is even an issue. When schools first started\nusing the internet in classrooms, Congress decided there needed to be\nguardrails. They passed the Children\u2019s Internet Protection Act in 2000, tying\naccess to discounted telecommunications equipment and services to the use of\nfilters that would keep students away from obscene and harmful images online.\nFast forward to today, and it\u2019s clear school districts are blocking way more\nthan those types of pictures.\n\nLast fall, the Center for Democracy and Technology released the results of a\nsurvey asking students about these filters. Almost three-quarters of high\nschoolers said they made it hard to complete assignments, and a larger share\nof LGBTQ+ students said they blocked content the students didn\u2019t think should\nbe blocked. Kristin Woelfel, who was on the CDT team that conducted the\nsurvey, said she thinks of these filters as \u201cdigital book bans,\u201d similar in\nimpact to the recent purges of books about race or LGBTQ+ topics from school\nlibraries across the country.\n\nAfter talking to Woelfel, I wanted to know more about what was being blocked\nat U.S. K-12 schools and how discriminatory the filters were.\n\n## Report Deeply and Fix Things\n\nBecause it turns out moving fast and breaking things broke some super\nimportant things.\n\nGive Now\n\nI thought it would be pretty easy to request records from school districts\nabout what websites their filters had blocked. After all, public schools mean\npublic records, right? Wrong. The first six districts I wrote to told me the\nrecords I wanted could not be shared for cybersecurity reasons. But some\ndistricts I contacted did release them, and I sent out more requests.\n\nAfter a few months, I had records from 16 districts across 11 states, and I\ncould see some important trends. The most obvious was that schools block a lot\nof websites. But in the rows of the very long spreadsheets cataloging these\nblocks, some entries stood out as particularly surprising:\nplannedparenthood.org, autismspeaks.org, thetrevorproject.org\u2014even nasa.gov.\nThe records showed blocking of LGBTQ+ resources, which were categorized by\nfilters as \u201chuman sexuality\u201d and \u201csexual content,\u201d making them sound like\npornography. The spreadsheets also listed blocks against categories like \u201csex\ned,\u201d \u201cabortion,\u201d and even \u201ceducational.\u201d\n\nDigital Book Banning\n\n### Five High Schoolers Describe the Dangers and Frustrations of Censored Web\nAccess\n\nTheir schools block information about The Trevor Project, abortion,\nmicroplastics, and more\n\nApril 13, 2024 06:00 ET\n\nOnce I had gone through the records, I started talking to students, wanting to\nhear from the people who face these blocks every day. Over and over, they\ndescribed having to work around the filters just to complete their\nassignments. Several described their shock at finding out that suicide\nprevention resources for LGBTQ+ teens are blocked by the filters in their\ndistricts.\n\nThese conversations made me want to talk to students in one of the districts\nthat was most aggressive in its approach to blocking websites. I flew from my\nhome base in New York to the Rockwood School District in the western suburbs\nof St. Louis, Missouri. There, I met more students and families who described\ntheir frustrations with the filter. I also ran a set of automated tests that\nmy colleagues built to check access to a bunch of websites on the district\u2019s\nWi-Fi.\n\nIn the month or so since then, a team of us at The Markup have turned all of\nthat reporting into the package of stories and visuals we just published. I\nhope you take some time to go through it!\n\nInside the main story is an interactive tool that lets you explore examples of\nblocked sites across five school districts. You can also read more about who\ngave me what information and the district-level findings in this \u201cShow Your\nWork\u201d piece.\n\n### Digital Book Banning\n\nRead our series\n\nCheck out this gallery of student experiences with the filters. It will give\nyou a good sense of what students are dealing with, in their own words.\n\nIf you find yourself wondering how far your local district goes with web\nfiltering, use my template to request the records yourself. This guide walks\nyou through how and where to submit a request.\n\nAnd one more thing: The Markup\u2019s visualizations engineer, Joel Eastwood, built\na quiz-style survey so students can test out a handful of websites from their\nschool computers and then share the block results. We won\u2019t automatically log\nany survey responses, and students are free to share their results on social\nmedia and leave it at that. But we hope they\u2019ll share them with us, too. I\u2019m\nespecially curious which other districts block The Trevor Project and It Gets\nBetter but leave accessible the Alliance for Defending Freedom, a legal\nnonprofit that the Southern Poverty Law Center labels an anti-LGBTQ+ hate\ngroup. School districts have been taken to court for that type of uneven\nblocking and forced to stop. If you have any young people in your life, please\npass along the survey!\n\nHave any questions about this investigation? Feedback?
