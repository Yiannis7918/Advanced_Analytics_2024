While\nthere are other roads to Product/Market Fit, consider copying some of these\nideas.\n\nsource\n\nWhat is the formula for going from an initial product idea to Product/Market\nFit\u2014a company that is growing and sustainable, with customers that want to pay\nand want to stay.\n\n(Assuming you even agree with that definition of Product/Market Fit.)\n\nThere isn\u2019t a fail-safe roadmap of course, but there is a progression that\ndescribes how WP Engine became a unicorn, supported by 17 years of articles\nfrom this site.\n\nHere\u2019s what that progression looks like. Then we\u2019ll explore the other\ntruth\u2014that it often doesn\u2019t work like this after all.\n\n  1. Personal Fit: \u201cPassion\u201d is useful, but winning requires a personal edge.\n  2. Market Fit: Most good ideas aren\u2019t good businesses.\n  3. Customer Fit: Talk to customers before you waste months building the wrong thing.\n  4. Build and ship the SLC quickly: It\u2019s where the real learning happens.\n  5. Marketing and Sales more than writing code and tweaking design.\n  6. Retention-driven Product development; attend to your existing customers first.\n  7. Prioritize systematically, ruthlessly, strategically.\n  8. Manage your psychology on a journey of self-discovery and constant rejection.\n\n## 1\\. Personal Fit: The inner fire, leveraging a personal edge to do what you\nwere meant to do\n\nA great idea or a great strategy that you can\u2019t execute well, isn\u2019t a good\nstrategy for you.\n\nYou start with nothing\u2014no product, no customers, no brand, no distribution,\nand compared to competitors, no money and no time.\n\nTo succeed, you need something. Something special. Something that gives you an\nedge, despite being woefully inadequate in every dimension. Is \u201cpassion\u201d that\nsomething?\n\n#### Passion\n\n> Do what you love, and the money will follow. \u2014Motivational advisors\n\nThat is false, as evidenced by most artists, philosophy majors, and the 80% of\nstartups that fail despite founders\u2019 genuine love and obsession.\n\nPassion is required; it\u2019s just not enough. Passion is the motivator,\nespecially in the dark times when your savings is depleted, competitors are\nbeating you, as you suffer a constant bombardment of rejection from potential\ncustomers and potential employees and potential investors, as you question\nyour self-worth and wonder whether the cause of your Impostor Syndrome is that\nyou\u2019re actually an impostor.\n\n> You have to be burning with an idea, or a problem, or a wrong that you want\n> to right. If you\u2019re not passionate enough from the start, you\u2019ll never stick\n> it out. \u2014Steve Jobs\n\nYou need to articulate exactly what your passion is, so that you can use it as\na filter for business concept. This is difficult; some people spend their\nwhole life trying to figure it out. Jerry Colonna says \u201cThe purpose of life is\nto discover who you are, and then live fully into that.\u201d It is not an\nexaggeration to say that a startup is a reflection of who you are; that\u2019s why\nthey call it \u201cyour baby.\u201d\n\nSee the last section of this article on personal fulfillment for a list of\nquestions that help you suss what your purpose and passions are.\n\nYour goal is to find the work you were meant to do. Your calling. The work\nthat you would do for free, but more\u2014what you are compelled to do.\n\nsource\n\nStill, the existence of passion doesn\u2019t imply the existence of a business\nmodel. (We\u2019ll solve that in the next step.) Passion doesn\u2019t give you a\ncompetitive edge, because all the other founders have passion, and larger\ncompanies have mountains of advantages that make \u201cpassion\u201d look like a sling-\nshot attacking an aircraft carrier. You need an edge.\n\n#### Leverage\n\n\u201cLeverage\u201d means yielding a huge output from a given input\u2014accomplishing an\ninordinate amount of quantity or quality, with relatively little time and\nmoney. You generate leverage from the mixture of talents, taste, and\nexperiences that you possess. To figure out how this works for you, see this\narticle for many types and examples of leverage.\n\nLeverage is good, but unique leverage is far better, because that\u2019s your\nsource of differentiation^1 from competitors and alternatives. Often this\nappears at the intersection of your peculiar above-average talents and\nexperiences, which taken together are unique^2. This uniqueness must then be\ncoupled with a particular way that you are approaching this problem and\nsolution, such that the combination of your leverage against your path is\nuniquely excellent, even for a small number of potential customers.\n\nThis leverage + path combination also forms the kernel of your strategy^3 as\nyour competitive positioning. You need something that competitors lack,\nbecause your customers are going to compare you to competitors whether you\nlike it or not, and you have to have an answer besides \u201cwe have this one minor\nfeature that they don\u2019t have\u201d or \u201cwe\u2019re $10 cheaper.\u201d\n\n> ^1 \u201cDifferent,\u201d not \u201cbetter.\u201d Yes, you will be \u201cbetter\u201d for according to\n> some set of people, but definitionally that means you\u2019re \u201cworse\u201d for another\n> set. The latter might even be orders of magnitude more numerous than the\n> former. That\u2019s OK, and that\u2019s why I don\u2019t like using the word \u201cbetter.\u201d You\n> should be distinctive, aligned with your calling and your strengths, so that\n> the set of people who do find your brand of different to be \u201cbetter\u201d will\n> flock to you, buy from you, and even love paying you for it.\n\n> ^2 The quintessential exponent of this idea is Scott Adams, writer of the\n> Dilbert cartoon, who points out that he is a decent illustrator but not a\n> great one, a decent humorist but worse than any comedian on Netflix, and has\n> held jobs in the tech sector, unlike almost any artist or comedian. It is in\n> the intersection of being in the top 25% in each of these three \u201ccircles of\n> competence\u201d that he is unique, not because he is top 1% or \u201cbest in the\n> world\u201d at any one thing.\n\n> ^3 Leveraging strengths into durable competitive advantage is one of the six\n> characteristics of great strategy.\n\nThe key question that summarizes this intersection of \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cpath\u201d is:\n\nWhy are you the perfect person to build this company?\n\n> Be yourself. Everyone else is taken. \u2014Oscar Wilde\n\n## 2\\. Market Fit: A working theory of why they will buy.\n\nOnce you inventory the inner world\u2014the shapes of spaces where you were meant\nto play\u2014you turn your gaze externally to figure out whether your idea works\nout in the market, in the world of customers, competitors, trends, problems-\nto-solve, jobs-to-be-done, and products. These things you do not control, and\nthus must understand, conform to, but also exploit.\n\nIt\u2019s right there in the name: \u201cProduct/Market Fit\u201d means fitting into the\nmarket, not just building something that would be\nfun/interesting/edifying/curious/exciting/ego-enhancing. Those are all good\nreasons to have a side-project, but none is a reason why that side-project\nwill become a profitable business, even at a scale that feeds a single person.\nThat\u2019s why most \u201cindie hacker\u201d startups and \u201cAI is cool\u201d startups fail\u2014the\ngenesis was \u201cfun project,\u201d not \u201cplausible business.\u201d\n\n\u261e If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! \u261c\n\n##### Subscribe for more, and Thank you for sharing!\n\n\u201cI had the problem myself, so I built a product to solve it.\u201d\n\nThis might be the most common origin story, tacitly concluding that \u201cthis must\nbe a business because I would have been a customer.\u201d Indeed, my startups all\nstarted this way. But your understanding of \u201cthe problem\u201d as it pertains to\nyou alone is much less likely to be a real business than you think. You are,\nin fact, not like your customer^4.\n\n> ^4 For a start, your customer isn\u2019t quitting their day job to create a\n> business.\n\nSometimes a passion project turns into a business anyway. That\u2019s what happened\nto me at Smart Bear. More on that later. But that\u2019s luck. The point of a\nframework like this one is to reduce your reliance on luck.\n\n> \u201cThe way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas. It\u2019s\n> to look for problems, preferably problems you have yourself.\n>\n> The very best startup ideas tend to have three things in common: they\u2019re\n> something the founders themselves want, that they themselves can build, and\n> that few others realize are worth doing. Microsoft, Apple, Yahoo, Google,\n> and Facebook all began this way.\u201d \u2014Paul Graham, How to Get Startup Ideas\n\n#### A theory of why they will buy\n\nYou need a plausible theory of the customer, market, and business model.\n\u201cPlausible,\u201d because many ideas fall apart under honest scrutiny. \u201cTheory\u201d\nbecause of course it won\u2019t be entirely correct, but it will be your working\nunderstanding of the world, which you modify as you learn.\n\nHere\u2019s exactly how to develop a specific theory of the market, customer, and\nyour positioning. You\u2019ll analyze these market characteristics:\n\n  1. Plausible: Do 10M people or 100k companies have the problem?\n  2. Self-Aware: Do they know & care they have the problem?\n  3. Lucrative: Do they have substantial budget to solve this problem?\n  4. Liquid: Are they willing and able to buy right now?\n  5. Eager: Do they want to buy from you, specifically?\n  6. Enduring: Will they still be paying(-it-forward) a year from now?\n\nA lot of people read that article, then said they wish they had read it before\nthey wasted two years of their life (and savings and heartache) building\n[insert name of failed startup]. Don\u2019t be one of those people.\n\nYou might think it infeasible to answer these questions, because the research\nis impossible or the idea is so new that existing data and trends are\nirrelevant. However, as you\u2019ll see in the article, you can do it using Fermi\nEstimation\u2014a technique useful not only in market analysis but for ROI,\nprobabilities, and decisions.\n\nsource\n\n#### Early strategy\n\nEven better than having a great business model is to have a great strategy.\nNot a twenty-page document, but a one-pager that conforms to the guidelines in\nthat article, explaining \u201chow we will win.\u201d It\u2019s never too early to be asking\nyourself how to leverage your strengths to build products that are great and\ndifferentiated despite your weaknesses. It\u2019s never too early to write down\nyour assumptions and decisions, to ensure they are at least self-consistent if\nnot self-reinforcing, so that when contrary evidence appears, you can notice\nthat, and react methodically.\n\nTo generate tangible strategic ideas for your business model or\nstrategy\u2014explaining \u201chow we will win\u201d\u2014consider creating a theory of where your\nproduct will fit in the customer\u2019s Needs Stack, pick a few of these tactics\nfor navigating the fact that the future is unpredictable, and decide how you\nwill generate \u201cLove\u201d and \u201cUtility\u201d types of Willingness-to-Pay. All of these\nare fun, accessible, strategic, and they work in practice.\n\n\u201cBut often the first idea is wrong, so why do I need a specific idea with a\nspecific business model?\u201d\n\nBecause walking in a random direction is not progress, and because the main\nway to discover the right direction, is to have a clear theory of the world,\nand notice when the world contradicts it, so you can pivot into a better\ntheory, and thus iterate into a genuinely great strategy and market-\nunderstanding.\n\nThat\u2019s what actually happened with Smart Bear, and Slack and WhatsApp and\nFlickr, as described and analyzed here. Only by having a specific, strong,\nclear idea, was it possible to notice what customers really wanted instead,\nwhich led each of those companies to pivot into the idea that became\nsuccessful.\n\nIn all those cases, the idea was very personal to the founders\u2014the personal-\nfit of passion for the solution and leveraging an edge to create something\nthat resonated with early users. But it was only with a specific theory of\nbusiness model and strategy, which was then negated by reality, and then an\nintentional pivot, to achieve Product/Market Fit.\n\n## 3\\. Customer Fit: Find the ideal customers first.\n\nThere\u2019s only one source of truth for what customers will buy: Customers.\n\nNot advisors, not experts, not analysts, not Twitter polls, not research, not\npast data, not even competitors\u2019 behavior. You have to talk to customers.\n\nsource\n\nCustomers are fickle. You ask whether they\u2019ll pay $100 if your product does\n______ and they say \u201cyes;\u201d then you build it and they don\u2019t buy. So why talk\nto them at all? Don\u2019t you need to put the actual product in front of them, and\nsee what they actually do?\n\nCustomers can tell you what their lives are like, which is how you validate\nyour business model and strategy from the previous section. Customers can tell\nyou what they won\u2019t buy, which has happened to me repeatedly. You can discover\nthat the average customer doesn\u2019t know the problem exists, or doesn\u2019t have a\nbudget for it, or isn\u2019t prioritizing it. When they say \u201cyes,\u201d it\u2019s a \u201cmaybe,\u201d\nbut when they say \u201cno,\u201d it\u2019s a \u201cno,\u201d and you just saved yourself months or\nyears of wasted time.\n\nYou can find out where they go to find products like this, so that you can\nadvertise in the right place. You can find out what language they use to talk\nabout the problem or solution, so you can copy that language in your\nadvertising and social media home page and capture their attention. You can\nfind out how their budgets work, so you can price and package and position\naccordingly. You can find out how they\u2019re addressing the problem today, so you\nknow what you\u2019re selling against, whether that\u2019s a competitor, an alternative,\nor something they\u2019re doing by hand. You can find out what causes them to break\nout of their daily life and say as Bob Moesta puts it, \u201cToday is the day I\u2019m\ngoing to buy ______,\u201d so that you can try to be there when that event happens,\nor possibly even cause it.\n\nIt is easy to find examples of successful companies who never asked customers\nwhat they wanted. That happened to me at Smart Bear. But again that relies on\nluck, and most of the time, you don\u2019t get lucky. This is not a good way to\ngamble the next few years of your life.\n\n\u261e If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! \u261c\n\n##### Subscribe for more, and Thank you for sharing!\n\nBut you don\u2019t want to do this work. You want to build the product because\nthat\u2019s the fun part. Potential customers are hard to find and they don\u2019t want\nto talk to you. It\u2019s going to be like that when you have a product too, so if\nyou can\u2019t do it now, you won\u2019t be able to do it later. Building the product\nfirst won\u2019t make it easier to find or talk to customers. Building the product\nfirst will, however, ensure that you haven\u2019t actually built what people want,\nbecause you never found out what people want.\n\nsource\n\n#### How to interview customers\n\nOnce you get someone on the phone, how do you interview them in a way that\nmaximizes learning and leads to a specific theory that you can execute on,\nfrom your unique winning advantage to pricing?\n\nThe customer validation system I\u2019ve developed is the Iterative-Hypothesis\ncustomer development method. This provides you with goals that you achieve\nusing interviews, how to create the hypotheses that will drive your business\nmodel, and how to write questions that maximize learning. 15 years ago it\ninvalidated a startup idea that I thought was good, and then validated the\nstartup idea that became WP Engine\u2014now a unicorn.\n\n#### How to get customers to talk to you\n\nThe way I got interviews for WP Engine is by using LinkedIn to find people who\nhad the title and industry I was targeting (web developers in WordPress), and\nasked them for an hour of their time to chat about a new startup concept for\nwhom they are the ideal customer. Furthermore I offered to pay any amount they\nwished for that hour, because I value their expertise and their time; I\u2019m not\nasking for a donation, I\u2019m genuinely interested in their expertise. Out of 50\nrequests, 40 agreed, and only one asked to be paid. (30 eventually became\ncustomers.)\n\nAnother technique is to buy ads for a landing page with an email sign-up form\nand web-chat, and talk to the people who arrive. Ask what they\u2019re looking for,\nwhat they need it for, why are they looking for it right now, how they found\nyou, and what else they\u2019re considering. When it goes well, ask them to hop on\nthe phone and run the full method above.\n\nAnother technique: Go to an event where your target customers are, walk the\nhalls, and interview everyone all day long. People like talking about\nthemselves, and you get to hone your pitch with 100 practice sessions.\n\nMore techniques:\n\nsource\n\n#### Find your ICP\n\nYour goal is not only to validate your theory of the market, but to discover\nyour ICP (Ideal Customer Profile). This is your \u201cperfect customer\u201d\u2014a segment\nalmost comically over-specified to be so perfect for your product that you are\ntruly the best choice in the market, and they would be crazy not to buy. You\nwill then aim all of your marketing messaging at this person: Website,\nadvertisement, terminology, writing style, pricing. When the ICP lands on the\nhome page, it should be obvious in three seconds that this is perfect for\nthem, that you \u201cget\u201d them, and they will be pulled through the process until\nthey\u2019re a customer.\n\nsource\n\nYou are scared that targeting only the ICP limits your potential market, but\nthis is not what happens. In \u201cSelling to Carol,\u201d I explain the mechanism and\nprovide examples showing that for every ICP there are 10x more people who make\nsimilar buying decisions, and 100x more who take more convincing but\nultimately also agree, and therefore you end up selling to a far wider market\nthan you feared, yet earning attention and loyalty from having a clear, unique\nmessage. Your company, brand, and product will actually mean something.\n\nsource\n\nFind and talk to the customers; they\u2019re the only ones with the answers.\n\n## 4\\. Build and ship the SLC.\n\nInterviews give you a better model of the world, but the real learning doesn\u2019t\nstart until people are using\u2014or more often, not using\u2014a product.\n\nSLC is my alternative to MVP:\n\nSimple, because complex things can\u2019t be built quickly, and you need to ship\nproduct to customers now.\n\nLovable, because crappy products are insulting to customers, and you didn\u2019t\nstart this company to make crappy products. The love overpowers the fact that\nit\u2019s buggy and feature-poor. There are many wonderful, powerful,\ncompetitively-defensible forms of \u201cLove.\u201d Pick a few.\n\nComplete, because products are supposed to accomplish a job. Customers want to\nuse a v1 of something simple, not v0.1 of something broken.\n\nBuild something small (but also lovable and complete), and ship it to\ncustomers, because that\u2019s when real \u201cprogress\u201d begins. That\u2019s how you learn\nthe truth.\n\nIf you\u2019re building for six months and a customer hasn\u2019t used it, you\u2019re not on\nthe road to Product/Market Fit; indeed you\u2019re not making progress on the\nbusiness at all. What you\u2019ve done is proved what you already knew\u2014you can\nbuild software.\n\nThe learning starts only when customers are (trying to) use it.\n\nsource\n\n## 5\\. Focus more on marketing and sales, less on product.\n\nYour natural inclination is to do what you enjoy and understand, so you need\nto press yourself to do so much marketing and sales that it feels like \u201ctoo\nmuch.\u201d\n\nAsk yourself: What can you do today, that will (a) get more people from the\ntarget market to come to the website or (b) convert more of those people to\ntry the product or (c) convert more of those to buy the product.\n\n\u261e If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! \u261c\n\n##### Subscribe for more, and Thank you for sharing!\n\nThe answer might be found in writing more code. Improving the new-user\nexperience, for example, could increase the conversion rate from \u201ctry\u201d to\n\u201cbuy.\u201d But more often the answer isn\u2019t inside the product; indeed several of\nthose steps happen before the person has used the product at all.\n\nYou\u2019ll advance the product anyway\u2014I know that. And you should, but you don\u2019t\nneed to be told to do that. After all, it\u2019s all you ever wanted to do, even at\nstep one. That\u2019s why you need to set an intention every day to make progress\non one of those questions. That\u2019s how you\u2019re going to generate growth.\n\nsource\n\n## 6\\. Prioritize retention-based product work.\n\nWhat does it mean, that one person out of billions cared enough about your\nproblem-space to notice your advertisement or social media post, then felt\ncompelled to follow the link, then was so intrigued by the website that they\njoined the 1-out-of-100 that tried the product, then liked what they saw\nenough to take out their wallet and pay, then started to use it... and then\ncancelled?!?\n\nAfter all that\u2014clear signals of desire, need, willingness to pay, and apparent\n\u201cfit\u201d\u2014they decided \u201cNope, this is not what I want.\u201d\n\nWhat it means is: You made the right promise, but didn\u2019t keep it.\n\nMarketing is where you discover the promise the customer wants you to make,\nand retention^5 is where you discover whether you\u2019re fulfilling that promise.\n\n> ^5 Actually, retention is a lagging, multi-factor indicator, which makes it\n> useful as a high-level check, but not useful as an operational day-to-day\n> metric. Here\u2019s a complete system for practical metrics that embraces this\n> fact and points to the right set of metrics.\n\nsource\n\nSome people believe that low retention is fine because you can make up for it\nwith growth. That\u2019s not true for two reasons:\n\n  1. Growth will start out good, but then will slow and halt sooner than you realize^6.\n  2. If customers don\u2019t want to use the product, your \u201cgrowth\u201d is fake news. It\u2019s not Product/Market \u201cFit\u201d if the \u201cmarket\u201d decides \u201cnot a fit\u201d after actually using the product.\n\n> ^6 See these articles with data from Product/Market fit companies and the\n> math behind growth grinding to a halt at companies with low retention.\n\nTherefore, when you do work on product features, build things that increase\nretention.\n\nThis starts by understanding why people cancel. Gaining this understanding is\ndifficult, because once they leave they don\u2019t want to talk to you anymore. You\nmight coerce them by paying for interviews with Amazon gift cards or\ncharitable donations. Some people will respond to an email (no harm in\nasking). Better is to look for signs that the customer isn\u2019t being successful\n(e.g. activity within the product) and reach out before it\u2019s too late, while\nthey\u2019re still in the middle of their struggle, and therefore might be willing\nand able to articulate it.\n\nRemember that your goal is not to discover what unsuccessful customers have in\ncommon, because successful customers often have those things in common as\nwell. Rather, it is to find patterns in unsuccessful customers that are not\nshared by successful customers. Those are the attributes that lead to action.\n\nFor example, if \u201cusing feature X\u201d means people are successful, maybe\nunsuccessful customers don\u2019t know about it (so you promote its usage), or\nmaybe they can\u2019t use it because it\u2019s incompatible with their workflow (so add\nintegrations or options). Sometimes, however, it\u2019s about the customers\nthemselves, where tuning the ICP means you find more customers who are already\na fit, perhaps targeting different industries or geographies, different stages\nor sizes of company, the title or attitude of the buyer, or the specific use-\ncases they are trying to solve for.\n\nThe Talk/Walk workshop might help, because it helps elucidate the difference\nbetween the promise and the execution. But probably, as usual, you just need\nto talk to customers.\n\n## 7\\. Ruthlessly, methodically, systematically prioritize.\n\nMore than just \u201cfocus,\u201d more than a generic admonition to \u201cprioritize,\u201d use a\nsystem that ensures you\u2019re leveraging your most valuable, most limited asset\n(time) to maximize progress.\n\nDo this by combining Fairytale Planning with the Rocks, Pebbles, Sand work-\nprioritization system:\n\nIdentify the next milestone.\n\n    At all times, be crystal clear about the single most important thing to achieve.\n    (Ex: Finding a good business model. Public launch. 20 paying customers. Getting trial conversion rates from 1% to 5%. Getting cancellation from 7%/mo to 4%/mo. Getting to $10k MRR so you can quit your day job.)\n    You have to be executing against the next milestone every day. Write it down and look at it every morning. Everything else is a distraction to be ignored, or a necessary evil that you should dispatch as quickly as possible, including delegation or accepting that it\u2019s fine if it\u2019s executed poorly or late.\nIdentify the current obstacle to achieving the milestone.\n\n    At all times, be crystal clear why it is difficult or slow or expensive to achieve that milestone.\n    (Ex: Can\u2019t figure out how to leverage your strengths for something differentiated and desirable. Easy to get someone to use it once, but only 15% use it again. Got 17 customers from Product Hunt but now there\u2019s no repeatable way to get more. Can\u2019t get people to agree to be interviewed. SLC isn\u2019t accepted by beta testers. Freemium users don\u2019t have enough incentive to convert to paid.)\n    You must face the difficult truth. Do not pick the obstacle that feels comfortable; pick the existential crisis that is uncomfortable exactly because it is critical and scary and true.\n    You have to be attacking or side-stepping the obstacle every day. Write it down and look at it every morning.\nSplit work into Rocks, Pebbles, Sand.\n\n    Use this specific Rocks, Pebbles, Sand framework to prioritize and schedule different types of work with the correct philosophy and process appropriate for each type.\nSelect the Rock that attacks the obstacle and milestone together.\n\n    Use Binstack to prioritize one Rock that addresses that most important milestone and attacks the obstacle. (You don\u2019t have time for more than one.)\n    If you can\u2019t think of one that\u2019s good enough, don\u2019t just proceed with a mediocre plan that will occupy the next three months; grab some friends\u2014or better yet, customers!\u2014and brainstorm a better one.\nSchedule Pebbles sparingly.\n\n    Because you have to focus on the Rock, and you have little time for anything else, use this ROI framework to prioritize just a few other activities that are valuable enough to justify spending your remaining time.\nAlmost everything should be only \u201cgood enough\u201d\n\n    You have taste, you have craft, and part of the reason you\u2019re doing all this is to express yourself. But almost everything you do will not determine whether the company is successful. (Repeat that last sentence until you fully internalize it.) Which means most things should only be \u201cgood enough.\u201d Let it go.\n    Most metrics should be satisfied, not maximized. Pick KPIs accordingly.\n    Having said all that, sometimes the very best aspects of a design are the little things, the obsessive things, the things you are compelled to make just so. Whether web design or UX design or a \u201cperfect\u201d feature which is only perfect because of the myriad corner cases that took a surprising amount of code and care to cover, but which means a new customer has an amazing experience. Pick your battles.\n\nDon\u2019t stray from the system. You don\u2019t have the time.\n\n\u261e If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! \u261c\n\n##### Subscribe for more, and Thank you for sharing!\n\n## 8\\. Manage your psychology.\n\nsource\n\nThroughout this a step-by-step roadmap, you face demanding psychological\nchallenges.\n\n  * Facing the truth\u2014not allowing \u201cwhat you wish were true\u201d to get in the way of finding out what is true, about your abilities, customer\u2019s wishes, the shape of the market, why people leave.\n  * Finding yourself\u2014coming face-to-face with who you are, and who you are not, figuring out what is actually important versus what is necessary or temporary, enjoying the journey especially when even a successful end result is often not what you hoped it would be.\n  * Making clear decisions\u2014deciding what you\u2019re not good at, and not trying to do it anyway; deciding your place in the market, and not trying to be all things to all people; deciding your ICP and having the fortitude to go all-in; deciding the current milestone, the main challenge, the one big thing you have to do, and sticking to it without getting distracted.\n  * Constant rejection\u2014your ideas won\u2019t be good enough, your customer interviews will negate key assumptions, 99% of website visitors won\u2019t take an action, long sales calls will result in nothing, customers will buy but then leave, employees won\u2019t join you, investors won\u2019t invest.\n  * Fluid change\u2014despite clear decisions, rejections often demand a change, which is difficult to accept, difficult to enact, difficult to admit when things are wrong, and difficult to decide whether some rejection should be ignored as an anomaly, or whether it\u2019s indicative of a \u201clearning\u201d that must result in a change.\n  * Acting while uncertain\u2014being \u201call-in\u201d even while knowing you must be wrong about some things, even while getting rejected and making changes, even while doing things you\u2019ve never done while experts tell you what to do differently, even while feeling like an impostor who has no right to be here, even while knowing you have no idea what you are doing while it appears everyone else knows exactly what they\u2019re doing. (Don\u2019t worry, they really don\u2019t.)\n\nThis might be the hardest thing you\u2019ve ever done. It\u2019s a gauntlet of pain,\neven if it\u2019s also the most exciting thing you\u2019ll do in your professional life.\nMany people stop because it\u2019s so hard. You can\u2019t blame them.\n\n## But you\u2019re not going to do this, are you...\n\nYou have a fun feature idea so you\u2019re just building it.\n\nYou always wanted to learn Rust so you\u2019re just learning it.\n\nAI is astounding and it\u2019s the future so you\u2019re building things with it, even\nthough it\u2019s a technology and not a customer\u2019s problem that needs solving.\n\nYou\u2019ve started your own company in part because you don\u2019t want to be shackled\nby \u201cprocesses\u201d and \u201cframeworks,\u201d so you\u2019re just doing whatever you want.\n\nVisual Studio is comfortable and Google Ad Manager is foreign and like Las\nVegas is designed to separate you from your money, to say nothing of the\ndiscomfort of asking for the sale or getting someone on a call to talk about\ntheir workflows or get an earful about how your precious software actually\nsucks.\n\nUncomfortable. Scary. And you\u2019re lost, unskilled at those things, not making\nprogress, not even wanting to. So you slip back to Visual Studio where you\nknow what to do, and enjoy doing it, and you\u2019re good at it.\n\nThen you post on Twitter about how you have $1600 in MRR after 18 months but\nit\u2019s okay because perseverance is a virtue. When in fact you\u2019ve fallen into\nthe well-known trap of doing what you\u2019re good at, what you love, but not what\nthe business needs done.\n\n\u261e If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! \u261c\n\n##### Subscribe for more, and Thank you for sharing!\n\nPerseverance is a virtue, if you\u2019re doing the right work, with the right\ngoals. It\u2019s a vice if it means you\u2019re moving diligently in the wrong\ndirection.\n\n## Smart Bear only halfway followed the roadmap\n\nBut who am I to talk?\n\nThe company I founded in 2002, sold in 2007, and that gave me the online\nhandle that persists to this day on this site, Smart Bear\u2019s first \u201cproduct\u201d\nCode Historian was a personal project, built because I want to learn .NET (we\nwould later rewrite everything in Java), built because I thought there was\nvalue in the historical record encoded in version control (all products that\noperated under that assumption failed).\n\nThis doesn\u2019t make me look old, right? Right???\n\nI didn\u2019t talk to customers ahead of time. I did talk to them a lot after they\nstarted paying, and learned that many didn\u2019t really want Code Historian at\nall, but rather they were abusing it to accomplish something else (in a story\ntold here). As a result, I created Code Reviewer, which sort of hit the need\nin question, but the architecture was all wrong and the features were all\nhacks. But all this customer feedback gave me the confidence to rewrite\neverything from scratch (which everyone says you should never do), resulting\nin a product called Code Collaborator, which made millions of dollars.\n\nWould I have found the idea for Code Collaborator by interviewing customers\nusing the \u201cIterative-Hypothesis\u201d method above? No, because I wouldn\u2019t have\nknown what to ask them, and they wouldn\u2019t have known to tell me. I would have\ndiscovered that Code Historian wasn\u2019t a good business idea... and that\u2019s it.\nMaybe I would have had a completely different and better idea. Maybe. But the\nfact is, the actual \u201cpath to success\u201d was to create something I liked, just\ninteresting enough to attract initial customers even though it\u2019s not a great\nbusiness, and then pivot to Code Reviewer, and then pivot to Code\nCollaborator. The interviews would have stopped everything cold. Does that\nmake \u201cinterviewing\u201d the wrong road to Product/Market Fit?\n\nI do think building and getting product into customers hands is far more\nvaluable than conversations. Smart Bear was an example of (1) having a\nspecific idea matching my passions, which then because of (4) building and\nshipping and (5) marketing and selling and (6) building for retention by\ntalking to customers, lead to the right idea. So, it was part of the path, but\nnot the full path.\n\nSo, while the path to success didn\u2019t honor every step in the roadmap, it still\nwould have failed if I had violated those other steps\u2014coding in isolation,\ncoding instead of selling, coding instead of honestly figuring out what\ncustomers really wanted.\n\n## WP Engine followed the roadmap and became a unicorn\n\nThat said, with WP Engine I traveled this roadmap exactly.\n\nWP Engine wasn\u2019t the initial idea. The first idea was for a marketing\nanalytics tool with features that Google Analytics lacked: A real-time event\ndashboard, a clever goal-setting-and-measuring system that worked\nretroactively, and the ability to capture web-form data even when it was only\npartially filled-in and never submitted, all with just one line of\nJavascript^7. But I ran that Iterative-Hypothesis method and after 20\ninterviews I learned that the idea wasn\u2019t strong enough^8. I was on the road;\nI (1) had a specific idea that (2) was clearly a great market and (3) vetted\nit with customers. Thanks to (3), I did not waste years on that project.\n\n> ^7 These features are typical of analytics tools today, but in 2009 it was\n> innovative.\n\n> ^8 This article gives the details of this invalidation, and how it was\n> different from WP Engine, which the same method validated.\n\nI then had the idea of a managed WordPress platform because I needed it\nmyself\u2014my blog would crash when I got to the top of Hackernews (a link-sharing\nsite). I asked other bloggers what they use to keep WordPress fast and\nscalable; many said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, but if you find it, tell me, because I\nneed that too.\u201d I ran the Iterative-Hypothesis method again, and this time it\nwas very clear what the need was, what people would pay, and how to find them.\nAnd the market was already huge (WordPress powered 11% of the largest 10\nmillion websites) yet growing fast (in 2023 it\u2019s 43%). I knew WordPress\nbecause I was a user, and for nearly twenty years I\u2019ve loved code optimization\nproblems, so this was a problem I understood and am ideal to solve, where\ncustomers agree the problem exists, are already spending money on it, and the\nmarket is large and growing. That\u2019s steps (1), (2), and (3), but this time the\nconcept was validated.\n\nI built just enough software to fulfill the promises of speed and scale,\nbuilding the first version in 30 hours. Good enough to not only stay alive and\nfast on a Hackernews day, but with almost no load on the server, which meant I\nwas still far away from a capacity limit.\n\nHundreds of simultaneous connections on a Hackernews day in 2010\n\nThe first version didn\u2019t even have a customer dashboard. I took credit cards\nwith the default web-form supplied by the online credit card service, and the\nrest was just WordPress.\n\nThe first version of the website was... \u201cspare,\u201d shall we say?\n\nThe second version of the website was so bad, there were database errors\nshooting out the bottom. Database errors, on the home page, of the company\nthat you\u2019re supposed to trust with your precious website.\n\nThe market need must be overwhelming, if customers walk through this wall of\nfire and say \u201cyeah just take my money.\u201d\n\nSo that\u2019s step (4), the SLC product that fulfills the job completely with the\nabsolute minimum of \u201cProduct.\u201d\n\nWe reached $1M ARR after 18 months. The reason\u2014besides having the right\nproduct with the right promise in the right market, which was elements (2) and\n(3)\u2014is step (5) focus on marketing and sales.\n\nBecause I did marketing and sales before even having a product login screen, I\nwas able to launch with 30 paying customers. Sure I worked on the product and\nworked support tickets, but what I focused on was how to get customers:\n\nFrom an \u201cadvisory group\u201d email update from 2010; my asks were for marketing\nand sales, not product and engineering.\n\nWhen you do marketing and sales, with a product that people actually need, in\na large and growing market (all covered by the exercise under (2)), then you\nmight have a nice growth curve:\n\nHit $1M ARR in first 18 months at WP Engine. But wait, the Product/Market Fit\nis still to come...\n\nWe\u2019ve always spent a lot of time on (6) retention. Sometimes years would pass\nwhere we wouldn\u2019t add a new feature, because all our engineering time was\nspent on the challenges of scale and continuing to improve on the promise of\nspeed and uptime. As a result, we\u2019ve had best-in-industry customer retention\nfor 14 years.\n\nHigh retention due to happy customers folds back into growth through word-of-\nmouth referrals and a thousand top-of-class reviews:\n\nsource\n\nAll that, combined with the hard work, the craftsmanship, the large and\ngrowing market\u2014did I mention the large and growing market?\u2014and yes also the\nluck, meant that in early 2012 we hit Product/Market Fit, as further detailed\nhere:\n\nThe previous chart\u2019s \u201cup and to the right\u201d growth from 2010-2012 looks almost\nflat compared to the sudden moment of Product/Market Fit, when it became\nhyper-growth, and never slowed.\n\nThis roadmap worked for WP Engine, and it worked for others. Consider this\nthread from Simon Hoiberg, explaining why his second bootstrapped company\nsucceeded (FeedHive) where his first failed. This roadmap echos within\nit\u2014playing in a large, growing market, finding and focusing on an ICP,\nbuilding only an SLC to start, and treating marketing and sales as more\nimportant than features and innovation:\n\nsource\n\nDo you have to walk this road like Simon discovered with FeedHive and I\ndiscovered at WP Engine, or can you stumble onto it halfway through like Smart\nBear, or can you take a completely different route and just emerge at the\nfinish line? Or can you just cherry-pick the things you like from this\nframework, and ignore the rest?\n\nYes to all the above. Everything is possible.\n\nBut not all roads are equally likely to result in success. We enjoy stories\nabout outliers because exceptions are interesting. But exceptions are not\nrepeatable, and therefore they may not be teaching you anything useful. I\nbelieve the roadmap above is repeatable. Not a guarantee of success, but a\nprocess that makes sense.\n\nIt\u2019s your life; you can take any road you please.\n\nWhat are you going to do?\n\nMany thanks to Gordon Daugherty, Rowan Udell, and Sathyanand S for\ncontributing insights to early drafts.\n\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear https://longform.asmartbear.com/product-market-fit-\nformula/ \u00a9 2007-2024 Jason Cohen @asmartbear\n\n\u261e If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! \u261c\n\n##### Subscribe for more, and Thank you for sharing!\n\nThe roadmap to Product/Market Fit (PMF)... maybe\n\n1 of 1\n\n### Thank you for sharing this article:\n\n### Inside this article\n\nNo ads.
