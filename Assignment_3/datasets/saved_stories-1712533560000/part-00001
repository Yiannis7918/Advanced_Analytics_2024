An artificial intelligence-powered chatbot\nmeant to help small business owners in New York City has come under fire for\ndispensing bizarre advice that misstates local policies and advises companies\nto violate the law. But the chatbot remains online, even as Adams acknowledged\nTuesday, April 2, 2024, that its answers were \u201cwrong in some areas.\u201d (AP\nPhoto/Peter K.

Mayor Eric Adams defended the decision this week even as he\nacknowledged the chatbot\u2019s answers were \u201cwrong in some areas.\u201d\n\nLaunched in October as a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for business owners, the chatbot\noffers users algorithmically generated text responses to questions about\nnavigating the city\u2019s bureaucratic maze.\n\nIt includes a disclaimer that it may \u201coccasionally produce incorrect, harmful\nor biased\u201d information and the caveat, since-strengthened, that its answers\nare not legal advice.\n\nIt continues to dole out false guidance, troubling experts who say the buggy\nsystem highlights the dangers of governments embracing AI-powered systems\nwithout sufficient guardrails.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re rolling out software that is unproven without oversight,\u201d said Julia\nStoyanovich, a computer science professor and director of the Center for\nResponsible AI at New York University. \u201cIt\u2019s clear they have no intention of\ndoing what\u2019s responsible.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE\n\nGovernor orders transit agency to drop bid to charge NYC Marathon $750K for\nuse of Verrazzano bridge\n\nNew York can take legal action against county\u2019s ban on female transgender\nathletes, judge says\n\nTransportation officials want NYC Marathon organizers to pay $750K to cross\nthe Verrazzano bridge\n\nIn responses to questions posed Wednesday, the chatbot falsely suggested it is\nlegal for an employer to fire a worker who complains about sexual harassment,\ndoesn\u2019t disclose a pregnancy or refuses to cut their dreadlocks. Contradicting\ntwo of the city\u2019s signature waste initiatives, it claimed that businesses can\nput their trash in black garbage bags and are not required to compost.\n\nAt times, the bot\u2019s answers veered into the absurd. Asked if a restaurant\ncould serve cheese nibbled on by a rodent, it responded: \u201cYes, you can still\nserve the cheese to customers if it has rat bites,\u201d before adding that it was\nimportant to assess the \u201cthe extent of the damage caused by the rat\u201d and to\n\u201cinform customers about the situation.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Microsoft, which powers the bot through its Azure AI\nservices, said the company was working with city employees \u201cto improve the\nservice and ensure the outputs are accurate and grounded on the city\u2019s\nofficial documentation.\u201d\n\nAt a press conference Tuesday, Adams, a Democrat, suggested that allowing\nusers to find issues is just part of ironing out kinks in new technology.\n\n\u201cAnyone that knows technology knows this is how it\u2019s done,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly\nthose who are fearful sit down and say, \u2018Oh, it is not working the way we\nwant, now we have to run away from it all together.\u2019 I don\u2019t live that way.\u201d\n\nStoyanovich called that approach \u201creckless and irresponsible.\u201d\n\nScientists have long voiced concerns about the drawbacks of these kinds of\nlarge language models, which are trained on troves of text pulled from the\ninternet and prone to spitting out answers that are inaccurate and illogical.\n\nBut as the success of ChatGPT and other chatbots have captured the public\nattention, private companies have rolled out their own products, with mixed\nresults. Earlier this month, a court ordered Air Canada to refund a customer\nafter a company chatbot misstated the airline\u2019s refund policy. Both TurboTax\nand H&R Block have faced recent criticism for deploying chatbots that give out\nbad tax-prep advice.\n\nJevin West, a professor at the University of Washington and co-founder of the\nCenter for an Informed Public, said the stakes are especially high when the\nmodels are promoted by the public sector.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a different level of trust that\u2019s given to government,\u201d West said.\n\u201cPublic officials need to consider what kind of damage they can do if someone\nwas to follow this advice and get themselves in trouble.\u201d\n\nExperts say other cities that use chatbots have typically confined them to a\nmore limited set of inputs, cutting down on misinformation.\n\nTed Ross, the chief information officer in Los Angeles, said the city closely\ncurated the content used by its chatbots, which do not rely on large language\nmodels.\n\nThe pitfalls of New York\u2019s chatbot should serve as a cautionary tale for other\ncities, said Suresh Venkatasubramanian, the director of the Center for\nTechnological Responsibility, Reimagination, and Redesign at Brown University.\n\n\u201cIt should make cities think about why they want to use chatbots, and what\nproblem they are trying to solve,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cIf the chatbots are\nused to replace a person, then you lose accountability while not getting\nanything in return.\u201d\n\nJAKE OFFENHARTZ\n\nOffenhartz is a general assignment reporter in the New York City bureau of The\nAssociated Press.\n\ntwitter\n\nmailto\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to\nfactual reporting.
