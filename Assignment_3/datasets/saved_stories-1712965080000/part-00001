Still, the\ncompany\u2019s announcement on February 19th was met with collective shock.\n\nThat day, plans for a large restructuring of the company\u2019s training and\nquality team were unveiled. As a result of the global plan, almost 900 Irish\njobs at the social media giant, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, were\nplaced at risk of redundancy.\n\nThe exact number of employees set to be made redundant at the company is not\nknown, although it is believed to be between 250 and 300. Affected employees\nthis week were signing off on severance packages, and on Friday, they were\nexpected to report for work at the company for the final time.\n\nInterviews with multiple TikTok employees based in Dublin have revealed\nconcern over the fairness and transparency of the redundancy process at the\nsocial media giant. Some suggest that aggressive hiring during the pandemic\nlaid the groundwork for February\u2019s announcement.\n\nREAD MORE\n\n## Inside TikTok: \u2018The company does not value any of their workers... there\nwas no compassion\u2019\n\n## Germany in recession: What does it mean for Ireland and the EU?\n\n## Number of IT workers shrinks by almost 6,000 on back of global downturn\n\nTikTok said that restructuring would allow the company to \u201cfurther enhance our\nquality assurance processes\u201d, and said that supporting affected employees was\na priority.\n\n\u201cIreland remains a hugely important base for us, and we\u2019re continuing to hire\nfor roles across our business here,\u201d a spokesman said.\n\nEmployees who spoke with The Irish Times did so on the condition of anonymity,\nas they were not authorised to speak publicly about the company.\n\n\u201cThe way it was carried out, they\u2019re losing a lot of valuable, good people\u201d,\none senior staffer said this week, days before he was due to be made\nredundant. \u201cThe whole [redundancy] process has been a joke, if you ask me.\u201d\n\nIn early 2020, as the video-sharing platform approached two billion mobile\ndownloads worldwide, TikTok established its EMEA trust and safety hub in\nDublin.\n\nScores were hired from firms such as Accenture and Covalen to fill the hub,\nwith most employed as quality analysts, a content moderation role. People were\nenticed by the promise of opportunity, good benefits and better pay.\n\nWithin a year of establishing the hub, the headcount at TikTok\u2019s Dublin\noperation had grown to over 1,100 employees, according to a blog post\npublished by Cormac Keenan, then head of trust and safety at TikTok.\n\n> They don\u2019t care who. They want to fulfil their quota. They want to find\n> somebody\n\n\u201cThey were hiring like crazy, 2020, 2021\u201d, says a senior staff member in the\ntrust and safety department. Employees worked remotely at first, and as\ncoronavirus restrictions eased, moved into WeWork spaces based in the south\ninner city.\n\nThe company was in a rush to get people in the door, but according to a number\nof employees, the recruitment process\u2019s quality controls were severely\nlacking.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they were very selective, which created a lot of chaos, and\nwhich led to a lot of conflict between different employees, different\ndepartments\u201d, says one trust and safety team leader, who had knowledge of the\ncompany\u2019s interview process. \u201cThey just hired people and they didn\u2019t invest in\nlearning and development.\u201d\n\nSome employees are highly critical of the environment created by rampant\nrecruitment during the pandemic.\n\n\u201cNo one knew what we were doing,\u201d says the trust and safety staffer.\n\n\u201cCommunication [from management] was very poor\u201d, another senior trust and\nsafety staffer says. \u201cThey don\u2019t actually tell you anything. And if you reach\nout, for aid or for help, no one\u2019s actually able to do anything.\u201d\n\nDespite all this, there were employees who found a way to enjoy the workplace.\n\n\u201c[There were] very good benefits for us, very flexible working hours\u201d, the\nteam leader says, who initially worked as a quality analyst.\n\n> Everyone was told that it doesn\u2019t matter how you do, you can\u2019t fail,\n> there\u2019ll be no repercussions, nothing will happen to you\n\nLast year, as TikTok\u2019s competitors were laying off staff in Ireland and across\nthe globe, management in Dublin were reassuring staff that their jobs were\nsafe. Staff numbers in Dublin last year climbed to about 3,000.\n\n\u201cWe had a meeting last year, around February, that everything [was] fine with\nus ... [that] we shouldn\u2019t worry,\u201d one staffer said.\n\nWith the benefit of hindsight, the staffer says, the warning signs were\napparent.\n\nTwice-yearly performances reviews became the subject of controversy within the\ncompany last year following allegations that managers were being pressurised\nby TikTok to assign low grades to employees.\n\nThere is \u201ca lot of pressure\u201d on team leaders to fulfil a quota of low-\nperformance grades, the team leader says. \u201cThey don\u2019t care who. They want to\nfulfil their quota. They want to find somebody.\u201d\n\nA TikTok spokesman said that the company provided guidelines to ensure\n\u201cconsistency and objectivity\u201d throughout the performance review process, but\nthat ultimately, managers were responsible for their team\u2019s performance\ngrades.\n\nSeveral employees state that from last year, underperformers \u2013 generally\ndefined as employees who received two low-performance review grades in a row \u2013\nwere offered payouts to leave the company, the alternative to undertake a\nperformance improvement programme.\n\nSeparately, in November 2023, employees in the training and quality team were\nasked to complete a policy proficiency test. In a moderation task, employees\nwere asked to label a queue of 100 videos according to a specific policy\nemployed by the company to moderate material posted to the app.\n\n> Everyone was told that it doesn\u2019t matter how you do, you can\u2019t fail,\n> there\u2019ll be no repercussions, nothing will happen to you\n\nEmployees had to undertake the test whether they worked directly as a\nmoderator or not, whether they worked with policy day-to-day or not, according\nto multiple employees. Some employees were asked to complete the test in a\nlanguage they did not normally work in. Other employees said they experienced\nglitches during their test, with videos failing to load.\n\nEmployees were not provided with a breakdown of where they went wrong in the\ntest, according to sources, although the company did provide employees with a\nfinal score.\n\n\u201cThe way that they sold it was that they\u2019re just trying to see how people\u2019s\nlevels of quality and policy knowledge,\u201d one senior staffer says. \u201cEveryone\nwas told that it doesn\u2019t matter how you do, you can\u2019t fail, there\u2019ll be no\nrepercussions, nothing will happen to you.\u201d\n\nThe company said that \u201cstandard\u201d proficiency tests are often carried out at\nTikTok, and that when the November tests were conducted, it was not linked to\nthe restructuring plan. It also said that the job role of all employees who\ntook the test in November was, in some way, linked to policy, and that\nemployees were expected to have a high level of policy knowledge.\n\nContrary to what was initially communicated to employees, the proficiency test\nwould have consequences, some months down the line.\n\nOn February 19th, an invitation to an online meeting before lunch prompted\nalarm among TikTok\u2019s Dublin workforce.\n\nAt the town hall meeting, TikTok\u2019s plans for restructuring were unveiled by\nthe company. A letter sent to training and quality employees after the\nmeeting, seen by The Irish Times, confirmed that their jobs were at risk of\nredundancy.\n\nTikTok said that the restructuring would be informed by new mechanisms piloted\nby the company to measure the quality of its moderation efforts.\n\nMorale at the company took a nosedive following the announcement. A special\naccommodation allowed employees affected to work from home, and some elected\nto stop attending the office. People were stressed.\n\nWith a limited number of alternative roles within the company available for\nat-risk employees, selection criteria was decided on to determine who would be\nretained at TikTok, following consultations between the company and 20 elected\nemployee representatives.\n\n> \u201c[It] just shows how the company does not value any of their workers ...\n> there was no compassion.\u201d\n\nTo much internal ire, eligibility for retention hinged, in part, on the\nNovember policy proficiency test and performance review cycle results. It is\nunderstood that some employees considered taking legal action against the\ncompany, alleging that the inclusion of these factors in the selection\ncriteria amounted to unfair dismissal.\n\nOn March 14th, those at risk of redundancy were informed of their fate. In the\nregion of 300 employees were told that their employment was \u201cpotentially\u201d the\nsubject of termination \u201cby reason of redundancy\u201d, according to a letter seen\nby The Irish Times.\n\n\u201cIf you got that email, you were pretty much done\u201d, says one senior staffer,\nwho was facing redundancy.\n\nThose told that they were not eligible for retention were facilitated in\napplying internally to other positions, in line with the company\u2019s stated\naspiration of avoiding redundancies.\n\nHowever, two such employees say that they were rejected from multiple\npostings. It\u2019s understood that employees were often unsuccessful in applying\nto internal positions, despite similarities between their previous job and the\nnew opportunity.\n\nOne employee, who was directly involved in discussions with the company during\nthe redundancy consultation process, says that the company was not receptive\nto many of the suggested amendments to the selection criteria, or the proposed\nseverance package.\n\nIn response to suggestions to remove the November test from the criteria, the\ncompany maintained that it was a \u201cfair, objective and uniform\u201d assessment,\naccording to internal documents seen by The Irish Times.\n\nFollowing consultation, the severance package available to affected employees\noffers four weeks of pay per year of service, plus an extra month\u2019s gross\nsalary and their notice period.\n\n[ ByteDance\u2019s US investors weigh options as bill to ban TikTok advances ]\n\nThis week, many of those who were not selected for retention in the new\nrestructure were signing off on the package. In excess of 250 employees, but\nless than 300, will be made redundant.\n\nOne senior staffer said that he doesn\u2019t mind getting let go if there are more\nqualified employees available to the company \u2013 but the way that employees were\ntreated during the process has left a sour taste.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sad because, the market here is different, it\u2019s more challenging to find\njobs nowadays\u201d, he says, days before being made redundant. \u201cThese kinds of\njobs are not as well paid as they used to be, and they are not as stable as\nthey used to be.\u201d\n\nAnother senior staffer reasons that, following the intensive hiring that\noccurred during pandemic times at TikTok, the company needed to shed extra\nweight within the trust and safety department to improve efficiency.\nUnfortunately, some workers are losing out because of a \u201ccallous\u201d redundancy\nprocess, she says.\n\nThe process has left her feeling undervalued, she says. \u201c[It] just shows how\nthe company does not value any of their workers ... there was no compassion.\u201d\n\n  * Join us for The Irish Times Inside Politics podcast live in Belfast on April 10th\n  * Sign up for push alerts and have the best news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phone\n  * Find The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date\n\nTikTokTech Lay-OffsFor You\n\n##### IN THIS SECTION\n\n## Inside TikTok: \u2018The company does not value any of their workers... there\nwas no compassion\u2019\n\n## Menopause support must tread a fine line between awareness and stigma\n\n## Take chances and copy Gen Z: Five secrets of workplace success\n\n## Court cuts WRC compensation award to Debenhams staff by 50%\n\n## Nurse awarded \u20ac30,000 over \u2018serious racial and sexual harassment\u2019 from care\nhome patients\n\n##### MOST READ\n\n## A sense of foreboding descends on Liveline.
