Here's a\nmore recent usage, from Marie Claire in April: \"Should Netflix finally open\nthe kimono to reveal its ratings and demographic figures, we may finally have\nour proof that girls really do rule.\"\n\nEvery few years, it seems someone feels compelled to say the phrase is making\na comeback. Back from where? From when? In 1998, The New York Times' Steven\nGreenhouse explored the corporate idioglossia of Microsoft. Here's his entry\nfor \"open the kimono\":\n\n> \"A marvelous phrase of non-Microsoft origin, probably stemming from the rash\n> of Japanese acquisitions of American enterprises in the 80's, that has been\n> adopted into the Microspeak marketing lexicon. Basically a somewhat sexist\n> synonym for 'open the books,' it means to reveal the inner workings of a\n> project or company to a prospective new partner.\"\n\nLike most online musings on the phrase, this one guesses at a rough time of\norigin but cites no evidence. Go down the search-engine rabbit-hole and you'll\nsee references to the '70s and '80s, but either nonexistent proof or dead\nlinks. Whatever decade it comes from, plenty of people wish it had stayed\nthere.\n\nForbes included \"open the kimono\" in a \"Most Annoying Business Jargon\"\nbracket, wherein Bruce Barry, a professor at Vanderbilt University's Owen\nSchool of Business, calls it \"kind of creepy.\"\n\nThe idea of a corporation wearing clothes is kind of creepy, because the idea\nthat corporations are people is creepy \u2014 as is the idea that showing skin\nequates somehow with sharing information. Did you write the company secrets on\nyour chest in Sharpie or something?\n\nGreenhouse calls it \"somewhat sexist\" \u2014 and there's probably a reason it's\n\"open the kimono\" and not \"drop the trousers\" \u2014 but a kimono is technically a\nunisex garment. That doesn't mean the phrase isn't read in a gendered way.\n\nIn a seething post titled \"'Open the Kimono' Needs to Die,\" a blogger known\nonly as \"erika\" calls it \"a noxious phrase which manages to be both racist AND\nsexist.\" To wit:\n\n> The metaphor relies on the Western myth of the geisha: a perfectly demure,\n> subservient sex slave, who masks her physical attributes with a big baggy\n> kimono. It is superficially salacious, then, to invoke the geisha in a\n> business context.\"\n\nThat is a very narrow understanding of what a geisha was and is, but \"the\nWestern myth of the geisha\" may well be that slight. Certainly, the kimono\nitself comes with a surfeit of problematic associations: \"Numerous portraits\nwere painted of Western women in kimono during the latter part of the\nnineteenth century,\" according to one abbreviated history of the garment. \"The\nkimono could add both an exotic and an erotic flavor to a painting.\"\n\n(Let us pause briefly here to allow our eyes to finish rolling.)\n\nSimilarly, \"the use of the kimono in films and books was often to cast doubt\non the morality of the woman wearing the garment,\" according to Sonia Jarvis,\ndistinguished lecturer at Baruch College School of Public Affairs. \"The early\nimagery equated kimono-wearing geishas with prostitutes. ... The later images\nexpanded to include western women of questionable morality as well.\" (Seeming\nto support this notion, \"open the kimono\" makes a cameo in a Supreme Court\ncase from 1914 involving a wife's alleged infidelity.)\n\nSo there is certainly a gendered dimension to the kimono in the West. But is\n\"open the kimono\" a racist phrase, exactly? Well, it can certainly lead to,\nshall we say, racist-adjacent behaviors like white guys dressing up in kimonos\nfor their marketing presentations.\n\nMaybe it's all cool, though. \"In Japan, the phrase is equivalent to 'loosen\nyour tie' meaning to get comfortable so we can talk plainly and directly,\"\naccording to one blogger, Bill McDaniel. But once again, there's no citation.\nAnd that's a bit of a leap from the equivalent of \"loosen your tie\" to the\nequivalent of \"unbutton your shirt.\"\n\nAll of this raises the question: Does the phrase even come from Japan?\n\nIn a Quora thread titled \"Idioms: Is the phrase 'open the kimono' sexist?\" one\nuser responds: \"What makes it weirder is that the phrase does not have its\norigins in the Japanese language, and is virtually unknown in Japan. The only\nJapanese pages talking about the phrase have been ones wondering, like me,\nwhere the heck it came from.\"\n\nAccording to Jarvis, the lecturer from Baruch College, \"The expression 'open\nthe kimono' actually originated in feudal Japanese times and referred to the\npractice of proving that no weapons were hidden within the folds of clothing.\"\n\nStill, it's not clear that this sense of the expression carries over to its\ncurrent usage. After all, we don't associate shaking hands with proving there\nare no weapons in hand.\n\nEven if \"open the kimono\" doesn't come from Japan, it might come from a fear\nof Japan, given its predominance in business circles.\n\n\"It does make sense that this ethnically charged bit of jargon could have\nemerged from fears in the U.S. about the rise of Japan's economy in the '80s,\"\nVanderbilt's Barry says. He adds that in his view the phrase is \"kind of\nracist, frankly, especially if it is borne of fear of Japanese economic\ndominance.\"\n\nThat explanation may make sense, but like most discussion on the subject, it's\nbasically conjecture. Unfortunately, the presumed authority on such things,\nthe Oxford English Dictionary, hasn't updated its entry for \"kimono\" in a\nwhile, and makes no reference to the opening thereof.\n\nWhich brings us to The Goblin Fox and Badger and Other Witch Animals of Japan\nby U.A. Casal, a study from 1959 that contains this passage:\n\n> \"It was believed that the wolf was shameful of sexual things, having no\n> strong sexual instincts. He would never disclose his organ, but hide it\n> behind his hanging tail. Should a person perchance see his sexual act, he or\n> she would have to open the kimono and disclose his or her own organ, so as\n> not to shame the wolf.\"\n\nThat is certainly interesting, but how could this possibly be the origin of\nthe phrase in its current use? Was some mad genius business school professor\nmaking his MBA students read this obscure text to get them thinking \"outside\nthe box\"? Is the wolf a wolf of Wall Street? Or something?\n\n\"No I don't honestly think biz types were pulling out some '50s Japanese\nfolklore,\" Barry says. \"I'm guessing its origin is like most idioms \u2014 someone\nsaid it first, and then it caught on ... but it's difficult to impossible to\nknow who said it first.\"\n\nSteve Haruch is a writer, and a contributing editor at the Nashville Scene.\nYou can follow him on Twitter @steveharuch.\n\n## Code Switch\n\nRace.
