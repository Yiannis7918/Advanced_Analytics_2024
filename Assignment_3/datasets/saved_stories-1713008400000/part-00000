Mus\u00e9e\nCarnavalet, Paris.\n\nIn 1688 a young Swiss milkmaid clambered over a rocky outcrop. She was halfway\nup an Alpine slope when she slipped and tumbled down several feet. Seriously\ninjured, she was carried away to hospital in the nearby town where she lay,\nunconscious, for days. Physicians plied her with remedies and performed\nsurgeries, and gradually she healed. Once physically better, however, she\nawoke and sat straight up in her hospital bed. Realising that she was no\nlonger in the mountain village of her birth, homesickness took hold. She spat\nout her foods and medicines and wailed, \u2018Ich will Heim; ich will Heim\u2019 (\u2018I\nwant to go home; I want to go home\u2019). She would say nothing else, turning\nlistlessly to the wall. Eventually her parents came to collect her. Almost\nimmediately her mood and condition improved and, after just a few days back in\nher own home, she returned to full fitness, entirely without the aid of\nfurther medical care.\n\nThe young woman\u2019s condition had only just received a name. This milkmaid was\none of the first people in the world to be diagnosed with nostalgia, a term\ncoined by the doctor Johannes Hofer. While today nostalgia is a relatively\nbenign longing for a bygone era, for Hofer it was a sickness acquired by a\nyearning for a distant place. Born in 1669, Hofer left his home in modern-day\nGermany to attend university in Basel, graduating in 1688. His final thesis\nwas a dissertation on nostalgia, or homesickness. Having first identified the\ndisorder among Swiss mercenary soldiers, Hofer was moved by the stories of\nafflicted youths who (unless rapidly returned to their native land) \u2018met their\nlast days on foreign shores\u2019, and devoted his studies to their mysterious\nailment, which he called la maladie du pays. As he saw it, nostalgia was a\nkind of pathological patriotic love, an intense and dangerous homesickness (or\ndas Heimweh in Hofer\u2019s native German). It was an illness associated with being\nuprooted, a sickness of displacement, a kind of sadness or depression that\narose from the desire to return to one\u2019s home.\n\nHofer was concerned that this dangerous, even fatal, disease had not yet\nreceived sufficient attention from medical experts. He endeavoured to describe\nand detail the condition, and to identify its causes, characteristics and\npossible cures. Symptoms ranged from continued sadness, thinking only of the\nfatherland, disturbed sleep, either \u2018wakeful or continuous\u2019, \u2018stupidity of the\nmind\u2019 and a low tolerance for cruel jokes or even the slightest injustice, to\ndepleted strength, diminished sight or hearing, fevers and a lack of interest\nin food or drink. It was these last two symptoms that most often led to the\npatient\u2019s eventual death.\n\nVictims of nostalgia, as Hofer identified, were primarily young people and\nadolescents sent to alien lands, regions and cities. He was very clear about\nthe malady\u2019s prognosis: it was potentially fatal, particularly if left\nuntreated. To heal a stricken nostalgic, he prescribed an unspecific\ncombination of dietary adjustment, warm baths and a change of circumstances.\nOnly very rarely did he recommend more extreme treatments, such as\nbloodletting and purgatives. In such cases, patients should ingest mercury or\narsenic, and leeches could be applied to veins. He also included recreational\ntherapies such as outdoor exercise and pleasant conversation, especially in\nnostalgia\u2019s early stages. If these methods failed and the disease advanced,\nthen nostalgia could only be resolved by a return to the victim\u2019s homeland. If\nthis was not possible \u2013 for example, if the patient was conscripted to an army\nor under employment as a domestic servant \u2013 then the outlook was grim. In such\ncases, the malady was incurable, if not deadly.\n\nHofer might well have been the first to name and diagnose nostalgia, but he\nwas certainly not the last. In the early decades of the 18th century, various\nSwiss doctors embellished Hofer\u2019s theories of nostalgia. In 1710 Thomas\nZwinger added a story about a sweet Swiss melody which produced pathological\nhomesickness in anyone who heard it. \u2018K\u00fche-Reyen\u2019, a milking song played on\nthe horn of an Alpine herdsman as he drove his animals, was thought to be such\na trigger, and its impact so debilitating on the armed forces, that its\nplaying among Swiss mercenaries was punishable by death in many European\narmies.\n\nNostalgia, then, seemed peculiarly Swiss \u2013 it was first identified by Swiss\ndoctors and foreigners remarked on the disease\u2019s unusual prevalence in the\nmountainous country. One German doctor even blamed the famed Alpine air,\nsuggesting that the Swiss were so acclimatised to their home atmosphere that\nit made them unable to breathe properly in other places. Albrecht von Haller,\na doctor from Bern, thought that nostalgia was an unfortunate side effect of\nrapid changes in altitude. He recommended an unusual, if logical, cure:\nsufferers from the sickness should be put in tall towers so that they might be\nelevated again to almost Alpine heights.\n\nIt is tempting to diagnose those who died from nostalgia in early modern\nEurope with modern medical conditions. Did they succumb to scurvy,\nmalnutrition, heart disease, malaria, depression, anorexia, or psychosis? But\nthe answers to these questions are unknowable. We have no bodies to examine\nand, even if we did, depression leaves no sign in bones or mummified flesh.\nDiseases are also mutable; they reflect the societies they infect.\n\nIndeed, as the centuries marched on, nostalgia changed. At first, it began to\naffect all highlanders, irrespective of their nationality. But it soon stopped\nbeing confined to those who lived in mountainous regions altogether. It became\neven more deadly and ever more closely studied. It was particularly common in\nthe United States, France and European colonies. During the American Civil\nWar, more than 5,000 soldiers were stricken with nostalgia. As the 19th\ncentury drew to a close, nostalgia\u2019s grip on the medical imagination slowly\nwaned. But it took until the early 20th century for the malady to claim its\nfinal victim. The last person to be diagnosed with and die from nostalgia was\nan American soldier fighting on the Western Front in 1918.\n\nThis version of nostalgia \u2013 one that posed a serious threat to people\u2019s health\nand survival \u2013 is very different from the one we live with today. Nostalgia no\nlonger affects the body, just the mind. We no longer call it a malady of\nmemory or attempt to treat nostalgic patients with brisk walks and\nbloodletting, and it is no longer a fatal diagnosis. Yet it still carries its\nown emotional baggage and remains a scapegoat for a range of perceived social,\ncultural and political sins. It is still an explanation \u2013 in all sorts of\ncircumstances \u2013 for what a critic might see as wayward or irrational acts or\nbeliefs. Indeed, while nostalgia no longer kills, it remains, strangely, a\nkind of pathology. A diagnosis to levy at your enemies; a malignancy that\nrequires excision.\n\nAgnes Arnold-Forster is the author of Nostalgia: A History of a Dangerous\nEmotion (Picador, 2024).\n\nSwitzerlandMedicine & Disease\n\n## Related Articles\n\n##### The Golden Age of Medieval Nostalgia\n\n##### Mental Illness: A Curse and a Blessing\n\n## Popular articles\n\n##### When Nostalgia Was Deadly\n\n##### \u2018How Finland Survived Stalin\u2019 by Kimmo Rentola review\n\n## Recently published\n\n##### When Nostalgia Was Deadly\n\n##### The Value of Wills to Historians\n\n##### \u2018How Finland Survived Stalin\u2019 by Kimmo Rentola review\n\n## Most read\n\n  1.
