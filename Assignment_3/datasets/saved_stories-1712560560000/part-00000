This is triggered\nautomatically when a new daily note is created via the internal Daily notes\nplugin, or the Periodic Notes plugin., It can also be run as a command from\nthe Command Palette.\n\n## Usage\n\n### 1\\. New Daily Note\n\nJust create a new daily note using the Daily notes or Periodic Notes plugin.\nThe previous day's incomplete todos will be rolled over to today's daily note.\n\nNote: Automatic rollover can cause conflicts with other plugins, particularly\nthe Templater plugin. If you're using Templater for your daily notes, it's\nrecommended that you disable automatic rollover in the plugin's settings and\ninstead trigger it manually after creation.\n\n### 2\\. Command: Manual Rollover Todos Now\n\nYou can also open your command palette (CMD+P on macOS) and start typing roll\nto find this command. No matter where you are in Obsidian, the previous day's\ntodos will get rolled forward. There is also a command called Undo last\nrollover which can be run within 2 minutes of a rollover occurring. Both\ncommands are potentially destructive, and the default text element undo\ncommand (CMD+Z on macOS) didn't work. Currently only 1 undo is available for\nuse at the moment.\n\nNote that if you create a daily note in the future, and you try to run this\ncommand, todos will not be rolled into a future date. They will always be\nrolled to today's note (if it doesn't exist, nothing will happen), from the\nchronologically closest (in the past) daily note.\n\n## Requirements\n\n  * You must have either:\n\n    1. Daily notes plugin installed or\n    2. Periodic Notes plugin installed AND the Daily Notes setting toggled on\n  * A Note folder set in one of these plugins. Inside it you must have:\n\n    1. 2 or more notes\n    2. All notes must be named in the format you use for daily notes (for example 2021-08-29 for YYYY-MM-DD )\n\n## Settings\n\n### 1\\. Disable automatic rollover\n\nIf you prefer to trigger the rollover of your todos manually, you can use this\nsetting to prevent the plugin from rolling them over when a new note is\ncreated.\n\n### 2\\. Template Heading\n\nIf you chose a template file to use for new daily notes in Daily notes >\nSettings or Periodic Notes > Settings, you will be able to choose a heading\nfor incomplete notes to roll into. Note that incomplete todos are taken from\nthe entire file, regardless of what heading they are under. And they are all\nrolled into today's daily note, right under the heading of choice.\n\nIf you leave this field as blank, or select None, then incomplete todos will\nbe rolled onto the end of today's note (for new notes with no template, the\nend is the beginning of the note).\n\n### 3\\. Delete todos from previous day\n\nBy default, this plugin will actually make a copy of incomplete todos. So if\nyou forgot to wash your dog yesterday, and didn't check it off, then you will\nhave an incomplete checkmark on yesterday's daily note, and a new incomplete\ncheckmark will be rolled into today's daily note. If you use the Undo last\nrollover command, deleted todos will be restored (remember, the time limit on\nthis is 2 minutes).\n\nToggling this setting on will remove incomplete todos from the previous daily\nnote once today's daily note has a copy of them.\n\n### 4\\. Remove empty todos in rollover\n\nBy default, this plugin will roll over anything that has a checkbox, whether\nit has content or not. Toggling this setting on will ignore empty todos. If\nyou have #2 from above toggled on, it will also delete empty todos.\n\n## Bugs/Issues\n\n  1. Sometimes you will use this plugin, and your unfinished todos will stay in the same spot. These could be formatting issues.\n\n  * Regex is used to search for unfinished todos: /\\s*[-*+] \\\\[ \\\\].*/g\n  * At a minimum, they need to look like: start of line | tabs- [ ]Your text goes here\n  * If you use spaces instead of tabs at the start of the line, the behavior of the plugin can be inconsistent. Sometimes it'll roll items over, but not delete them from the previous day when you have that option toggled on.\n\n  2. Sometimes, if you trigger the rollover function too quickly, it will read the state of a file before the new data was saved to disk. For example, if you add a new incomplete todo to yesterday's daily note, and then quickly run the Rollover Todos Now command, it may grab the state of the file a second or two before you ran the command. If this happens, just run the Undo last rollover command. Wait a second or two, then try rolling over todos again.\n\nFor example (no template heading, empty todos toggled on):\n\n    \n    \n    You type in: - [x] Do the dishes - [ ] Take out the trash And then you run the Rollover Todos Now command. Today's daily note might look like: - [ ] Take out the trash And the previous day might look like - [x] Do the dishes\n\n  3. There are sometimes conflicts with other plugins that deal with new notes -- particularly the Templater plugin. In these situations, your todos may be removed from your previous note, and then not be saved into your new daily note. The simplest remedy is to disable the automatic rollover, and instead trigger it manually.\n\n## Installation\n\nThis plugin can be installed within the Third-party Plugins tab within\nObsidian.\n\n## About\n\nAn obsidian plugin that rolls over todo items from the previous daily note\n\n### Topics\n\nobsidian obsidian-plugin obsidian-md\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\n### License\n\nMIT license\n\nActivity\n\n### Stars\n\n238 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n6 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n57 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases 15\n\n1.1.8 Latest\n\nJan 22, 2024\n\n\\+ 14 releases\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Contributors 14\n\n## Languages\n\n  * JavaScript 100.0%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
