Despite its\npotential to revolutionize connectivity, Starlink has been unable to obtain a\nlicense to operate in South Africa from the Independent Communications\nAuthority of South Africa (Icasa).\n\nIcasa's requirements mandate that any applicant must have 30% ownership from\nhistorically disadvantaged groups to be considered for a license. However,\nmany in South Africa resorted to creative methods to access Starlink services,\nincluding purchasing roaming packages from countries where Starlink is\nlicensed.\n\nHowever, Icasa clarified in a government gazette last November that using\nStarlink in this manner is illegal. Additionally, Starlink itself stated in\nthe recent email to users that the 'Mobile \u2013 Regional' plans are meant for\ntemporary travel and transit, not permanent use in a location. Continuous use\nof these plans outside the country where service was ordered will result in\nservice restriction.\n\nStarlink advised those interested in making its services available in their\nregion to contact local authorities.\n\n## Related articles\n\n01:06\n\n### Internet disruption hits West and Central Africa, Netblocks and Cloudflare\ndata shows\n\n15/03 - 07:03\n\n01:10\n\n### Senegal: authorities restrict internet access and ban march\n\n14/02 - 11:25\n\n01:09\n\n### Senegal cuts internet access as lawmakers debate a bill to possibly extend\nthe president's tenure\n\n05/02 - 21:50\n\n## From the same country\n\n### How South Africa's former leader Zuma turned on his allies and became a\nsurprise election foe\n\n1 hour ago\n\n01:00\n\n### South Africa inflation eases in March\n\n5 hours ago\n\n### South Africa ; Gauteng Health raises concerns about rising food poisoning\nincidents\n\n17/04 - 11:27\n\nView more\n\nShare\n\nMore About\n\n  * Internet\n  * starlink\n  * Elon Musk\n  * Africanews\n\nRecommended for you\n\nRecommended by\n\n## Related articles\n\n01:06\n\n### Internet disruption hits West and Central Africa, Netblocks and Cloudflare\ndata shows\n\n15/03 - 07:03\n\n01:10\n\n### Senegal: authorities restrict internet access and ban march\n\n14/02 - 11:25\n\n01:09\n\n### Senegal cuts internet access as lawmakers debate a bill to possibly extend\nthe president's tenure\n\n05/02 - 21:50\n\n## From the same country\n\n### How South Africa's former leader Zuma turned on his allies and became a\nsurprise election foe\n\n1 hour ago\n\n01:00\n\n### South Africa inflation eases in March\n\n5 hours ago\n\n### South Africa ; Gauteng Health raises concerns about rising food poisoning\nincidents\n\n17/04 - 11:27\n\n## On the same subject\n\n  * NEWS\n\n####\n\nGo to video\n\n### Another Nigerian socialite Cubana Chief Priest charged for throwing money\nin air\n\n17/04 - 15:55\n\n  * NEWS\n\n####\n\nGo to video\n\n### Nigeria suspends permit of 3 private jet operators\n\n16/04 - 16:27\n\n  * NEWS\n\n####\n\n01:08\n\n### Burkina Faso expels three French diplomats for 'subversive activities'\n\n33 minutes ago\n\n  * NEWS\n\n####\n\nGo to video\n\n### Deadly Sahel heatwave caused by \u2018human-induced\u2019 climate change: Study\n\n5 hours ago\n\n  * NEWS\n\n####\n\nGo to video\n\n### Britain's contentious plan to send some migrants to Rwanda hits a hurdle\nin Parliament\n\n5 hours ago\n\n  * NEWS\n\n####\n\nGo to video\n\n### Burna Boy, William Ruto land a spot on \u2018TIME\u2019 2024 Most Influential People\n\n5 hours ago\n\n  * NEWS\n\n####\n\nGo to video\n\n### Another Nigerian socialite Cubana Chief Priest charged for throwing money\nin air\n\n17/04 - 15:55\n\n  * NEWS\n\n####\n\nGo to video\n\n### Nigeria suspends permit of 3 private jet operators\n\n16/04 - 16:27\n\n  * NEWS\n\n####\n\n01:08\n\n### Burkina Faso expels three French diplomats for 'subversive activities'\n\n33 minutes ago\n\n  * NEWS\n\n####\n\nGo to video\n\n### Deadly Sahel heatwave caused by \u2018human-induced\u2019 climate change: Study\n\n5 hours ago\n\n  * 1\n  * 2\n  * 3\n  * 4\n  * 5\n  * 6\n\n## More stories\n\n#### Nigeria\n\n### A Nigerian schoolgirl abducted by extremists 10 years ago is rescued\npregnant, with 3 kids\n\n1 hour ago\n\n#### Spain\n\n### Spain: 2 smugglers convicted for the death of 4 Moroccan migrants\n\n1 hour ago\n\n#### Tunisia\n\n### Tunisian journalist sentenced to 6 months in prison for insulting an\nofficial\n\n1 hour ago\n\nBy using this website, you agree with our use of cookies to improve its\nperformance and enhance your user experience.
