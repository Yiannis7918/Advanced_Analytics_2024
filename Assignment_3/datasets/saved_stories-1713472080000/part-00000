The project addresses the\ngrowing demand for buying and selling Bitcoin without compromising personal\ndata, introducing a groundbreaking solution for peer-to-peer exchanges.\n\nMostro manages communications on top of Nostr, creating a decentralized\nplatform without a single point of failure. This design enhances resistance to\ncensorship compared to other existing options.\n\n## Docs\n\nIf you are a developer and want to create your own Mostro's client, you can\nread the development documentation here:\n\nDocs\n\n## Donate\n\nMostro is FOSS, if you think the project is useful, consider making a donation\nto help us develop and maintain it in the long term. Thanks!\n\nDonate\n\n## How it works?\n\nMostro works as an escrow that allows the buyer and seller to exchange bitcoin\np2p, reducing the risk for both parties, while only holding the Sats for the\nminimum time necessary. Mostro handles Bitcoin using a Lightning Network node.\nThe node creates hold invoices for sellers and pays the buyers lightning\nregular invoices.\n\nIt works within the Nostr protocol so buyers and sellers will need Mostro's\nclients to buy/sell Bitcoin. Users will be able to rate Mostros and Mostros\nwill compete to obtain more users to survive. Users should reject bad Mostros\nwhich will lose incentives to keep existing.\n\nGithub\n\n## Disclaimer\n\n### By using Mostro, you agree to the following terms and conditions:\n\nMostro is an open-source software that is available for anyone to use, copy,\nmodify, and run.
