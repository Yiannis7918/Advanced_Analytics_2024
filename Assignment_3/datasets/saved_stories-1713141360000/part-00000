To reduce the labor and time cost to collect or annotate data\n> by humans, researchers start to explore the use of LLMs to generate\n> instruction-aligned synthetic data. Recent works focus on generating diverse\n> instructions and applying LLM to increase instruction complexity, often\n> neglecting downstream use cases. It remains unclear how to tailor high-\n> quality data to elicit better instruction-following abilities in different\n> target instruction distributions and LLMs. To this end, we introduce\n> CodecLM, a general framework for adaptively generating high-quality\n> synthetic data for LLM alignment with different downstream instruction\n> distributions and LLMs. Drawing on the Encode-Decode principles, we use LLMs\n> as codecs to guide the data generation process. We first encode seed\n> instructions into metadata, which are concise keywords generated on-the-fly\n> to capture the target instruction distribution, and then decode metadata to\n> create tailored instructions. We also introduce Self-Rubrics and Contrastive\n> Filtering during decoding to tailor data-efficient samples. Extensive\n> experiments on four open-domain instruction following benchmarks validate\n> the effectiveness of CodecLM over the current state-of-the-arts.\n\nComments:| Accepted to Findings of NAACL 2024  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI);\nMachine Learning (cs.LG)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.05875 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2404.05875v1 [cs.CL] for this version)  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Zifeng Wang [view email] [v1] Mon, 8 Apr 2024 21:15:36 UTC (1,343 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled CodecLM: Aligning Language Models with Tailored\nSynthetic Data, by Zifeng Wang and 7 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI cs.LG\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
