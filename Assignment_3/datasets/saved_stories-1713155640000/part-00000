Those without a watch can use the Internet to view\nthe current time on the watchmaker's website. The concept is actually the same\nas decimal minutes in French Revolutionary decimal time.\n\nInstead of hours and minutes, the mean solar day is divided into 1,000 parts\ncalled .beats. Each .beat lasts 86.4 seconds (1.440 minutes) in standard time.\nThe time of day begins at midnight and is notated from 1 to 1000; for example,\n@248 BEATS would indicate a time 248 .beats after midnight, representing\n248\u20441000 of a day, just over 5 hours and 57 minutes.\n\nThere are no time zones in Swatch Internet Time; it is globally based on the\ntime zone of Biel, Switzerland, where Swatch's headquarters is located, what\nis conventionally known as Central European Time (UTC+1 or West Africa Time).\nSwatch calls this \"Biel Mean Time\" (BMT), although it is not actually mean\nsolar time as measured in Biel. And, unlike civil time in Switzerland and many\nother countries, Swatch Internet Time does not observe daylight saving time\n(DST).\n\n## History[edit]\n\nSwatch Internet Time was announced on 23 October 1998, in a ceremony at the\nJunior Summit '98,^[1] attended by Nicolas G. Hayek, President and CEO of the\nSwatch Group, G.N. Hayek, President of Swatch Ltd., and Nicholas Negroponte,\nfounder and then-director of the MIT Media Lab. During the Summit, Swatch\nInternet Time became the official time system for Nation.1, an online country\n(supposedly) created and run by children.\n\n### Uses[edit]\n\nA Swatch watch showing .beat time in the bottom part of the display\n\nDuring 1999, Swatch produced several models of watch, branded \"Swatch .beat\",\nthat displayed Swatch Internet Time as well as standard time, and even\nconvinced a few websites (such as CNN.com) to use the new format.^[2] PHP's\ndate() function has a format specifier, 'B', which returns the Swatch Internet\nTime notation for a given time stamp.^[3] It is also used as a time reference\non ICQ, and the online role-playing game Phantasy Star Online used it since\nits launch on the Dreamcast in 2000 to try to facilitate cross-continent\ngaming (as the game allowed Japanese, American and European players to mingle\non the same servers). In March 2001, Ericsson released the T20e, a mobile\nphone which gave the user the option of displaying Internet Time. Outside\nthese areas, it is infrequently used. While Swatch still offers the concept on\nits website, it no longer markets Beat watches.^[citation needed] In July\n2016, Swatch released Touch Zero Two, its second wirelessly connected watch,\nwith Swatch Internet Time function.\n\n### Beatnik satellite controversy[edit]\n\nSee also: Sputnik 99\n\nIn early 1999, Swatch began a marketing campaign about the launch of their\nBeatnik satellite, intended to service a set of Internet Time watches. They\nwere criticized for planning to use an amateur radio frequency for\nbroadcasting a commercial message (an act banned by international treaties).\nThe satellite was intended to be deployed by hand from the Mir space station.\nSwatch instead donated the transmitter batteries for use in normal Mir\nfunctions, and the satellite never broadcast.^[4]\n\n## Description[edit]\n\nSee also: Abolition of time zones\n\nThe concept was touted as an alternative, decimal measure of time. One of the\nsupposed goals was to simplify the way people in different time zones\ncommunicate about time, mostly by eliminating time zones altogether. It also\ndoes away with the division of the day into 12 or 24 parts (hours), then 60\nparts (minutes), then 60 parts (seconds), then 1000 parts (milliseconds).\nFurthermore, there is no confusion between the AM/PM system and 24-hour time.\n\n### Beats[edit]\n\n.beats per unit of timeUnit| Beats conversion  \n---|---  \n1 day| 1,000 .beats  \n1 hour| 41.6 .beats  \n1 min 26.4 s| 1 .beat  \n1 min| 0.694 .beats  \n1 s| 0.011574 .beats  \n  \nInstead of hours and minutes, the mean solar day is divided into 1,000 parts\ncalled .beats. Each .beat lasts 1 minute and 26.4 seconds. One .beat is equal\nto one decimal minute in French decimal time.\n\nAlthough Swatch does not specify units smaller than one .beat, third party\nimplementations have extended the standard by adding \"centibeats\" or \"sub-\nbeats\", for extended precision: @248.00. Each \"centibeat\" is a hundredth of a\n.beat and is therefore equal to one French decimal second (0.864\nseconds).^[5]^[6]\n\n### Time zones[edit]\n\nThere are no time zones; instead, the new time scale of Biel Mean Time (BMT)\nis used, based on the company's headquarters in Biel, Switzerland. Despite the\nname, BMT does not refer to mean solar time at the Biel meridian (7\u00b015\u2032E), but\nto the standard time there. It is equivalent to Central European Time and West\nAfrica Time, or UTC+1.\n\nLike UTC, Swatch Internet Time is the same throughout the world. For example,\nwhen the time is 875 .beats, or @875, in New York, it is also @875 in Tokyo.\nUnlike civil time in most European countries, Internet Time does not observe\ndaylight saving time, and thus it matches Central European Time during\n(European) winter and Western European Summer Time, which is observed by the\nUnited Kingdom, Ireland, Portugal and Spain's Canary Islands during summer.\n\n### Notation[edit]\n\nThe most distinctive aspect of Swatch Internet Time is its notation; as an\nexample, \"@248\" would indicate a time 248 .beats after midnight, equivalent to\na fractional day of 0.248 CET, or 04:57:07.2 UTC. No explicit format was\nprovided for dates, although the Swatch website formerly displayed the\nGregorian calendar date in the order day-month-year, separated by periods and\nprefixed by the letter d (e.g. d31.01.99).\n\n### Calculation from UTC+1[edit]\n\nThe formula for calculating the time in .beats from UTC+1 is:\n\nWhere h is UTC+1 hours and m is UTC+1 minutes. The result is rounded down.^[7]\n\n## When does the day begin?[edit]\n\nExample cities across the globe @1000 BEATS midnight:\n\n@1000 BEATSCity| Time zone| Time  \n---|---|---  \nSan Francisco| PST| 03:00 PM  \nNew York| EST| 06:00 PM  \nLondon| BST| 11:00 PM  \nBiel| CET (UTC+1)| 12:00 midnight  \nTokyo| JST| 08:00 AM  \nSydney| AEST| 09:00 AM  \n  \n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Traditional Chinese timekeeping \u2013 1 k\u00e8 = 10 'beats'\n  * Metric time\n  * New Earth Time\n  * Unix time\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ at page generation\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Wright, Sarah H.
