'Cordial\nAgreement') comprised a series of agreements signed on 8 April 1904 between\nthe United Kingdom and the French Republic which saw a significant improvement\nin Anglo-French relations. On the surface, the agreement dealt with minor\nissues related to fishing and colonial boundaries. Egypt was recognized as\npart of Britain's sphere of influence, and Morocco as part of France's. The\nEntente was not a formal alliance and did not involve close collaboration, nor\nwas it intended to be directed against Germany. However, it paved the way for\na stronger relationship between France and Britain in the face of German\naggression. It should not be mistaken for the official Anglo-French military\nalliance, which was only established after the outbreak of World War I in\n1914.^[1]\n\nThe main colonial agreement was the recognition that Egypt was fully in the\nBritish sphere of influence and likewise Morocco in France's, with the proviso\nthat France's eventual dispositions for Morocco include reasonable allowance\nfor Spain's interests there. At the same time, Britain ceded the Los Islands\n(off French Guinea) to France, defined the frontier of Nigeria in France's\nfavour, and agreed to French control of the upper Gambia valley; while France\nrenounced its exclusive right to certain fisheries off Newfoundland.\nFurthermore, French and British proposed zones of influence in Siam\n(Thailand), which was eventually decided not to be colonised, were outlined,\nwith the eastern territories, adjacent to French Indochina, becoming a\nproposed French zone, and the western, adjacent to Burmese Tenasserim, a\nproposed British zone. Arrangements were also made to allay the rivalry\nbetween British and French colonists in the New Hebrides.\n\nIn long-term perspective, the Entente Cordiale marked the end of almost a\nthousand years of intermittent conflict between the two states and their\npredecessors, and replaced the modus vivendi that had existed since the end of\nthe Napoleonic Wars in 1815 with a more formal agreement.^[2] The Entente\nCordiale represented the culmination of the policy of Th\u00e9ophile Delcass\u00e9\n(France's foreign minister from 1898 to 1905), who believed that a Franco-\nBritish understanding would give France some security in Western Europe\nagainst any German system of alliances (see Triple Alliance (1882)). Credit\nfor the success of the negotiation of the Entente Cordiale belongs chiefly to\nPaul Cambon (France's ambassador in London from 1898 to 1920) and to the\nBritish Foreign Secretary, Lord Lansdowne. In signing of the Entente Cordiale\nboth powers reduced the virtual isolation into which they each had withdrawn.\nBritain had no major-power ally apart from Japan (1902). France had only the\nFranco-Russian Alliance. The agreement threatened Germany, whose policy had\nlong relied on Franco-British antagonism. A German attempt to check the French\nin Morocco in 1905 (the Tangier Incident, or First Moroccan Crisis), and thus\nto upset the Entente, served only to strengthen it. Military discussions\nbetween the French and the British general staffs were initiated. Franco-\nBritish solidarity was confirmed at the Algeciras Conference (1906) and\nreconfirmed in the Second Moroccan Crisis (1911).\n\n## Background[edit]\n\nA cartoon on the Entente Cordiale from Punch, with John Bull stalking off with\nthe harlot Marianne (in what is supposed to be a Tricolour dress) and turning\nhis back on the Kaiser, who pretends not to care. The tip of the scabbard of a\ncavalry sabre protrudes from beneath the Kaiser's army overcoat, implying a\npotential resort to force.\n\nThe French term Entente Cordiale (usually translated as \"cordial agreement\" or\n\"cordial understanding\") comes from a letter written in 1843 by the British\nForeign Secretary Lord Aberdeen to his brother, in which he mentioned \"a\ncordial, good understanding\" between the two nations. This was translated into\nFrench as Entente Cordiale and used by Louis Philippe I in the French Chamber\nof Peers that year.^[3] When used today the term almost always denotes the\nsecond Entente Cordiale, that is to say, the written and partly secret\nagreement signed in London between the two powers on 8 April 1904.\n\nThe agreement was a change for both countries. France had been isolated from\nthe other European powers, in part because of the destruction of the\nNapoleonic Wars, threat of liberalism and perceived recklessness in the\nFranco-Prussian War of 1870\u201371. German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck also\nmanaged to estrange France from potential allies, as it was thought that\nFrance might seek revenge for its defeat in the Franco-Prussian War, reverse\nits territorial losses and continue to press for the conquest of the Saar and\nterritories in the Ruhr. Britain had maintained a policy of \"splendid\nisolation\" on the European continent for nearly a century, intervening in\ncontinental affairs only when it was considered necessary to protect British\ninterests by limiting the power of other countries, such as Russia in the\nBalkans, or supporting the creation of Belgium to weaken the Netherlands and\ncreate a buffer between France and the German states. The situation for\nBritain and France changed in the last decade of the 19th century.^[4]\n\nThe change had its roots in a British loss of confidence after the Second Boer\nWar and a growing fear of the strength of Germany. As early as March 1881, the\nFrench statesman L\u00e9on Gambetta and the Prince of Wales, Albert Edward, met at\nthe Ch\u00e2teau de Breteuil to discuss an alliance against Germany. The Scramble\nfor Africa prevented the countries from coming to terms, however. On the\ninitiative of Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain, there were three rounds\nof British-German talks between 1898 and 1901. The British decided not to join\nthe Triple Alliance, broke off the negotiations with Berlin, and revived the\nidea of a British-French alliance.^[5]\n\nThe British and French colonial empires reached their peaks after World War I,\na reflection of the power of this agreement.\n\nWhen the Russo-Japanese War was about to erupt, France and Britain found\nthemselves on the verge of being dragged into the conflict on the side of\ntheir respective allies. France was firmly allied with Russia, while the\nBritish had recently signed the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. In order to avoid\ngoing to war, both powers \"shucked off their ancient rivalry\"^[6] and resolved\ntheir differences in Africa, the Americas, Asia, and the Pacific. Toward this\nend, French foreign minister Th\u00e9ophile Delcass\u00e9, and Lord Lansdowne, the\nBritish Foreign Secretary, negotiated an agreement on colonial matters, and\nLord Lansdowne and Paul Cambon, the French Ambassador to the Court of St\nJames's, signed the resulting convention on 8 April 1904.^[7]\n\n## Documents signed[edit]\n\nFrench and British scouts, with their respective national flags, shaking\nhands. 1912\n\nThe Entente was composed of three documents:\n\n  * The first and most important document was the Declaration respecting Egypt and Morocco. In return for the French promising not to \"obstruct\" British actions in Egypt, the British promised to allow the French to \"preserve order ... and provide assistance\" in Morocco. Free passage through the Suez Canal was guaranteed, finally putting the Convention of Constantinople into force, and the erection of fortifications on part of the Moroccan coast forbidden. The treaty contained a secret annex dealing with the possibility of \"changed circumstances\" in the administration of either of the two countries.\n  * The second document dealt with Newfoundland and portions of West and Central Africa. The French gave up their rights (stemming from the Treaty of Utrecht) over the western coast of Newfoundland, although they retained the right to fish the coast. In return, the British gave the French the town of Yarbutenda (near the modern border between Senegal and the Gambia) and the Iles de Los (part of modern Guinea). An additional provision dealt with the border between French and British possessions east of the River Niger (present-day Niger and Nigeria).\n  * The final declaration concerned Siam (Thailand), Madagascar, and the New Hebrides (Vanuatu). In Siam, the British recognised a proposed French sphere of influence to the east of the Menam (Chao Phraya) River basin; in turn, the French recognised a proposed British influence over the territory to the west of the Menam basin. Both parties eventually disclaimed any idea of annexing Siamese territory. The British withdrew their objection to the French introducing a tariff in Madagascar. The parties came to an agreement which would \"put an end to the difficulties arising from the lack of jurisdiction over the natives of the New Hebrides\".^[8]\n\n## Aftermath[edit]\n\nIt is unclear what exactly the Entente meant to the British Foreign Office.\nFor example, in early 1911, following French press reports contrasting the\nvirility of the Triple Alliance with the moribund state of the Entente, Eyre\nCrowe minuted: \"The fundamental fact of course is that the Entente is not an\nalliance. For purposes of ultimate emergencies it may be found to have no\nsubstance at all. For the Entente is nothing more than a frame of mind, a view\nof general policy which is shared by the governments of two countries, but\nwhich may be, or become, so vague as to lose all content.\"^[9]\n\nSuch commentary however proved spurious, for the Triple Alliance collapsed as\na result of Italy remaining neutral at the outbreak of World War I, while the\nEntente endured.\n\n## Commemoration[edit]\n\nThe 100th anniversary of the Entente Cordiale in 2004 was marked by a number\nof official and unofficial events, including a state visit to France in April\nby Queen Elizabeth II, and a return visit by President Jacques Chirac in\nNovember. British troops (the band of the Royal Marines, the Household Cavalry\nMounted Regiment, the Grenadier Guards and the King's Troop, Royal Horse\nArtillery) also led the Bastille Day parade in Paris for the first time, with\nthe Red Arrows flying overhead.\n\nAt both London Waterloo International and Paris Gare du Nord, the flags of\nUnited Kingdom and of France were depicted, connected with the words 'Entente\ncordiale' superimposed on posters. Some French political leaders had\ncomplained^[10] about the name \"Waterloo\" for the destination of trains from\nParis, because the London terminus is named after the 1815 battle in which a\nBritish-led alliance defeated Napoleon's army, and in 1998 French politician\nFlorent Longuep\u00e9e wrote to British Prime Minister Tony Blair demanding,\nwithout success, that the name be changed.^[10]^[11] However, in November 2007\nSt Pancras International became the new London terminus for the Eurostar\nservice.\n\n### Entente Cordiale Scholarships[edit]\n\nThe name \"Entente Cordiale\" is used for the Entente Cordiale Scholarships\nscheme, a selective Franco-British scholarship scheme which was announced on\n30 October 1995 by British Prime Minister John Major and French President\nJacques Chirac at an Anglo-French summit in London.^[12] It provides funding\nfor British and French students to study for one academic year on the other\nside of the Channel. The scheme is administered by the French embassy in\nLondon for British students,^[13] and by the British Council in France and the\nBritish embassy in Paris for French students.^[14]^[15] Funding is provided by\nthe private sector and foundations. The scheme aims to foster mutual\nunderstanding and to promote exchanges between the British and French leaders\nof tomorrow. The programme was initiated by Sir Christopher Mallaby, British\nambassador to France between 1993 and 1996.^[16]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Anglo-French Supreme War Council\n  * France\u2013United Kingdom relations\n  * Auld Alliance\n  * British military history\n  * Causes of World War I\n  * Diplomatic history of World War I\n  * Diplomatic history of World War II\n  * Entente (disambiguation)\n  * Entente frugale\n  * Foreign relations of France\n  * Franco-British Council\n  * Franco-British Union\n  * French entry into World War I\n  * History of the foreign relations of the United Kingdom\n  * International relations of the Great Powers (1814\u20131919)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Margaret Macmillan, The War That Ended Peace: The Road to 1914 (2013) ch 6\n  2. ^ A.J.P.
