Currently 2.0 is believed to be largely functional while work on\n3.5 has just begun.\n\nOfficially, .NET Framework 3.5 never supported anything below XP, and .NET in\ngeneral never supported 95. This project changes that, backporting CLR 2.0 to\n95 and Framework 3.5 to 9x.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Windows 95\n\n.NET CLR 2.0 requires the following to be installed:\n\n  * Windows 95 B (OSR 2) or newer. Currently older versions will not work, however I am investigating ways to get around this requirement (see below).\n  * Internet Explorer 5.01. The installer is packaged in this repository at bin/msie501. One day I plan to make it an automatic part of the installation process, however for the time being you'll have to run it manually.\n  * Microsoft USB Supplement. The installer is packaged in this repository at bin/usbsupp or may be on your Windows 95 install disc at other/updates/usb. This is why 95 B is necessary, the USB supplement makes patches to VMM32.VXD that allow .NET to work, and it isn't available on RTM/A. I am currently investigating why this is necessary and whether it can be patched out.\n\nOnce those are installed, simply download dotnet9x.exe from the Releases tab\nand install! After that, applications written for .NET Framework 2.0 - 3.5\nshould run.\n\n## Known Issues\n\nIn my testing, this appears to largely work now, but .NET may still make some\ncalls to missing system functions that need to be patched or reimplemented. If\nyou run into an unexpected exception or error message, feel free to make a\nthread in the Issues tab.\n\n## About\n\nBackport of .NET 2.0 - 3.5 to Windows 9x\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\nActivity\n\n### Stars\n\n746 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n19 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n14 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases 1\n\nContinuous build Latest\n\nMar 18, 2024\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Languages\n\n  * NSIS 65.3%\n  * ASP.NET 13.8%\n  * TSQL 13.5%\n  * C 3.6%\n  * C# 2.0%\n  * HTML 1.0%\n  * Other 0.8%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
