The White House and Senate Democrats\nproposed new legislation Tuesday that would help combat pandemic aid fraud.\n(Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post)\n\nListen\n\n4 min\n\nShare\n\nComment\n\nSave\n\nSenate Democrats on Tuesday unveiled a sweeping, roughly $1.3 billion bill\nthat would expand the federal government\u2019s powers to find and prosecute\npandemic fraud, as Washington scrambles to recover the federal aid stolen by\nscammers during the worst economic crisis in a generation.\n\nThe measure, which would deliver on an earlier budget request from President\nBiden, arrived as the Justice Department announced that its efforts to date\nhad resulted in charges against more than 3,500 defendants and the seizure or\nforfeiture of more than $1.4 billion in illegally obtained coronavirus relief\nfunds.\n\nBut the new spending package immediately faced the prospect of a tough slog on\nCapitol Hill: Even though lawmakers often complain about waste, fraud and\nabuse, they have failed for years to overhaul government benefits, upgrade\ncomputer systems or take other steps that would safeguard federal funds in a\nfuture emergency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe newly proposed legislation would devote about $675 million toward guarding\nprotecting programs from identity theft, aiming to ward off criminals who\noften use real Americans\u2019 stolen information to collect government aid. With\nit, lawmakers would allocate roughly $550 million to the Justice Department\nand leading inspectors general to bolster their oversight of federal spending.\n\nThe bill is authored by Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the majority whip; Sen.\nGary Peters (D-Mich.), who leads the chamber\u2019s Homeland Security and\nGovernmental Affairs Committee; and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the chairman of\nthe Finance Committee. The trio of lawmakers coupled their proposed new\nspending with additional powers for federal law enforcement officials, who\nwould gain more time to investigate crimes targeting certain pandemic relief\nprograms.\n\n\u201cBad actors got their hands on money that was meant to help our communities\nget through what was an incredibly difficult time,\u201d Peters told reporters,\nadding that the proposal would help the government \u201cget back stolen funds.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe legislation follows four years after the U.S. government first marshaled\nits historic response to the pandemic, adopting aid packages that would total\nmore than $5 trillion in federal aid. The money ultimately rescued the\neconomy, helping workers who were out of a job and preserving businesses from\nshuttering forever. But the funds also became a tempting target for criminals,\nwho seized on Washington\u2019s haste and generosity starting in the Trump\nadministration and racked up billions of dollars in fraud.\n\nAt the height of the pandemic, scammers targeted the nation\u2019s unemployment\ninsurance program, stealing the identities of real people to obtain benefits\nthey did not deserve, according to a year-long investigation by The Washington\nPost, the Covid Money Trail. Last year, federal officials estimated that\nfraudsters stole $135 billion from the program, amounting to $1 of every $7\nspent on jobless benefits.\n\nOthers beginning in 2020 deceived the Small Business Administration using fake\ntax records, ineligible Social Security numbers and names of the dead,\nobtaining low-interest loans that were supposed to help companies maintain\ntheir payrolls during the economic crisis. Two relief funds \u2014 the Paycheck\nProtection Program, or PPP, and the Covid-19 Economic Injury Disaster Loan, or\nEIDL \u2014 together may have been responsible for more than $200 billion in fraud-\nrelated losses, the agency\u2019s inspector general has found.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nGene Sperling, a senior adviser to the president, attributed the rampant theft\nof taxpayer dollars to a lack of investment in federal technology, an\noverwhelming demand for federal aid and \u201cthe removal of several basic anti-\nfraud safeguards\u201d at the start of the pandemic. That, he said, \u201cled the Biden\nadministration to inherit historic levels of fraud.\u201d\n\nIn response, Biden in 2022 announced a new chief prosecutor for pandemic fraud\nat the Justice Department. The following year, he asked Congress to approve a\n$1.6 billion package that would toughen federal enforcement against\ncoronavirus-related crimes, while bolstering U.S. aid programs to prevent\nfuture identity theft.\n\nUnder Biden\u2019s watch, the Justice Department has also ramped up its enforcement\nefforts: In August, for example, federal prosecutors announced that they had\nbrought 718 charges and other sanctions during a three-month sweep, totaling\nabout $836 million in alleged fraud. On Tuesday, Attorney General Merrick\nGarland highlighted some of those prosecutions, stressing that the\ngovernment\u2019s work is still \u201cfar from over.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nBut the activity has stood in stark contrast with the delays on Capitol Hill,\nwhere lawmakers for years have failed to deliver on Biden\u2019s requests, leaving\nfederal watchdogs underfunded. Often, House Republicans have blasted the\npresident for misspending coronavirus relief money, even though federal\ninvestigators have found the worst abuses occurred during the Trump\nadministration. No GOP lawmakers signed onto the new bill unveiled Tuesday,\nthough party lawmakers have backed some of the proposed changes to\nunemployment insurance and other federal benefit programs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nPersonal finance\n\nThe basics for making smart money decisions\n\nAdvice|IRS Commissioner Werfel talks about Direct File, audits and IRS budget\n\nAre you ready to buy a house?
