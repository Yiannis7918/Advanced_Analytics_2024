I also wrote in the past about the\nhistory of OpenStreetMap Carto, the cartographic face of OpenStreetMap and\nwithout doubt the most influential map design project in OpenStreetMap \u2013 today\nas well as historically. But it is neither the only map design endeavor in and\naround OpenStreetMap, nor is it going to be in its current position forever.\nIn this post i am going to discuss various other map design projects \u2013\nhistoric and present \u2013 that exist in and around OpenStreetMap and that\nsubstantially have shaped or are shaping map design in OpenStreetMap.\n\n### Beyond OSM-Carto\n\nI am going to leave a more concrete discussion of commercial OSM based maps\nout of this post. As discussed in the previous post about the history of\ndigital map making, the domain of web maps is strongly dominated by big tech\ncompanies and their digital platforms. These have mostly optimized their maps\nfor cost efficiency \u2013 in terms of operational costs for serving the maps just\nas in terms of development costs. Summarily, these maps are largely simplistic\nin design, dominated by relatively coarse visual elements and with a lack of\nconscious attention to detail and semantic nuances. Seen as art they feature\nelements in particular of primitivism and dadaism \u2013 as well as a kind of\ndigital technological surrealism. It is fitting in my opinion to say that\nthese maps form the core of post modern cartography.\n\nExamples of commercial OpenStreetMap based web map styles: Maptiler and Mapbox\n\nBecause of their dominance in today\u2019s practical use of maps they have a\nsignificant influence on contemporary map design but at the end of the day\nthey contribute very little to the advancement of the state of the art in map\ndesign in general. The big problem is \u2013 as i have pointed out in the past \u2013\nthat the technological basis of today\u2019s digital map design is largely financed\nby these companies, which hampers the development of map design beyond that.\n\nWhat i do want to mention in that context is the probably most important\nprecursor of today\u2019s corporate cartography, the avant-garde of post modern\ncartography you might say. That is quite clearly the web maps work of Stamen\nfrom \u2013 in parts \u2013 more than 10 years ago.\n\nEarly map styles by Stamen\n\nThere is another quite substantial set of maps that are commercially\ndeveloped, usually by smaller businesses, for specific use cases that i am\nalso going to skip here. For most of these, the main connection to\nOpenStreetMap is that they use OSM data. Collectively, this body of map design\nwork is quite significant for the OSM community as it demonstrates a broad\nrange of use cases for OpenStreetMap data to the wider public and the mapper\ncommunity. But individually, these maps tend to be of rather limited reach,\ncompared to the maps of the big tech platforms, their individual significance\nfor OpenStreetMap design wise is rather small, especially also since the vast\nmajority are not open source. Reviewing this set of map styles from a map\ndesign perspective would probably also be interesting, but i consider this out\nof scope here.\n\nAnd finally i am also going to leave out various specialized QA maps and\noverlays produced by the OSM community \u2013 some of these feature noteworthy\ndesign techniques \u2013 but overall, their purpose is so much different from that\nof normal maps that they are not really that relevant here.\n\nHistorically the origin of OSM based map design was Osmarender. Osmarender was\nthe primary platform of visualization of OSM data and mapper feedback in the\nearly days of the project and has enormously shaped mapping in OpenStreetMap\nas well as OSM based map design \u2013 which can still to some extent be observed\nin present day maps. Unfortunately, documentation of these early days of\nOpenStreetMap is generally still very poor.\n\nHistoric example of the Osmarender map design\n\nEspecially also together with the Tiles@home framework facilitating\ndistributed rendering of maps, Osmarender was a fairly revolutionary project\nwhich anticipated many later developments and already tried to address some\nproblems that we still struggle with today. It was also the first attempt of\nthe OSM community at cooperative map design and the experiences made with that\nsignificantly influenced the approach to subsequent projects.\n\nI won\u2019t discuss OSM-Carto and its XML predecessor style here \u2013 for that please\nrefer to my previous posts. I am going to look at the various OSM-Carto\nderivatives a bit though that form a significant part of the OSM map design\necosystem.\n\nI will start with the German OSM-Carto fork, maintained by Sven Geggus. This\nOSM-Carto variant features various color and design differences to the parent\nproject, in particular\n\n  * A road coloring scheme derived from traditional German road maps\n  * Various different symbols specific to German cartographic culture\n  * Green instead of purple boundaries\n  * Rendering tracktype=1 tracks similar to service roads\n  * Different rendering of footways/cycleways/paths\n\nIn addition, the German style features a sophisticated label language\nselection and transliteration system. This is implemented during database\nimport, meaning the style uses a different database schema than OSM-Carto.\n\nThe German OSM-Carto fork is the only of the larger forks that is regularly\nkept in sync with upstream changes. This constrains the ability to implement\nlarger and more invasive design changes because such would make synchronizing\nwith upstream changes more difficult. Some of the color changes in land cover\nand water coloring, that have been implemented in the style at some time, have\nbeen dropped again because of that.\n\nGerman OSM-Carto fork\n\nThe French map style, in contrast to the German one, is a hard fork that has\nsplit off from OSM-Carto a longer time ago. It therefore retains in particular\nmany of the original colors of early OSM-Carto for buildings, landcover and\nroads. It is maintained by Christian Quest and, apart from some symbology\nadjustments to French cartographic tradition, comes with a number of\ninnovative feature extensions and rendering techniques. Some have been adopted\nby OSM-Carto in the meantime \u2013 like the depiction of trees and the rendering\nof details on golf courses. Others remain unique to the french style.\nSpecifically:\n\n  * The rendering of street lamps using circular symbols similar to those for trees.\n  * Rendering of pedestrian crossings on roads.\n  * Rendering of sport specific linework on sport pitches.\n  * Normalization and abbreviation of French names.\n  * Low zoom landcover depiction based on scaled raster rendering.\n\nFrench OSM-Carto fork (high zoom level)\n\nFrench OSM-Carto fork (low zoom level)\n\nThen there is the AJT-Style by Andy Townsend as an OSM-Carto fork with a\ndistinct British and pedestrian focus. The AJT-Style departed from OSM-Carto\ndesign wise even before the French one. It is noteworthy for being likely the\nmost feature rich style in OpenStreetMap in total, with a strongly\ndifferentiated rendering of various attributes of roads and paths (like\nBritish rights of way) and a huge number of different classes of point\nfeatures being shown with point symbols.\n\nDesign wise the style is relatively traditional with pixel painted raster\nsymbols. And much of the symbology uses relatively cryptic and not necessarily\nvery intuitive encodings to represent semantic differences. In contrast to\nOSM-Carto, which is explicitly designed to be intuitively usable without a\nlegend, the AJT style deliberately accepts to require a legend to be used and\nputs formal clarity in differentiation above intuitive readability.\n\nTechnically, the most remarkable aspect of the AJT-Style is the way tag\ninterpretation is performed at data import through successive conditional in-\nplace manipulation of attributes in a more than 10k lines long LUA script.\n\nBritisch/Rural pedestrian focused OSM-Carto fork by Andy Townsend\n\nAnd for completeness: There is of course also my own Alternative Colors style\n\u2013 which i have discussed extensively here in past posts so i will only mention\nit in passing in this post.\n\nFinally, i want to mention one OSM-Carto fork that is not strictly open source\n\u2013 which i cover here primarily because it is meanwhile featured on the\nOpenStreetMap website. I am talking about the Tracestrack style. This is an\nOSM-Carto derived collage of design components from OSM-Carto and OpenTopoMap\nremixed/overlayed with separately designed additional features and design\nmodifications. The add-on features and design modifications have a distinct\nurban European cultural focus \u2013 contrasting quite clearly with the global\norientation of OSM-Carto.\n\nI call the Tracestrack style not strictly open source because, although they\nhave published some code components of the style and licensed them under an\nopen license, this entails only parts of the style. The openly licensed parts\ndo not allow you to independently reproduce the map they offer. While this is\nin principle totally legitimate as far as OSM-Carto is concerned (which is\nCC-0), the only partial open licensing is potentially at odds with the more\nconstraining license of OpenTopoMap (CC-BY-SA).\n\nOSM-Carto derived style by Tracestrack\n\nSo far these were OSM-Carto forks \u2013 which are implementation wise based on the\nOSM-Carto code. There is another class of OSM-Carto derivatives that are mere\nOSM-Carto look-alikes which try to imitate the OSM-Carto design appearance-\nwise to some extent but which do so with an independent implementation. The\ndepth of imitation in those varies, some merely try to resemble the color\nscheme in broad strokes while others go into more depth to resemble the design\nof OSM-Carto. The ESRI client side rendered demo is one of the earliest and\nthe most ambitious projects in that regard.\n\nClient side rendered OSM-Carto look-alike by ESRI based on a proprietary tool\nchain\n\nThe trend to imitate OSM-Carto design in technically independently developed\nmap design projects is testimony to two things:\n\n  * That the visual design of OSM-Carto has turned into a kind of reference standard in OSM map design meanwhile independent of the concrete technical implementation.\n  * That designing a rich OSM based map similar in scope to OSM-Carto is a lot of work that requires significant map design skills and therefore avoiding this substantial investment and building on what OSM-Carto has developed over many years is an attractive option (which does not seem to become less attractive with the increasing age of the project and the design).\n\nOutside the range of OSM-Carto derivatives we have another particularly\nnoteworthy project: OpenTopoMap. OpenTopoMap is being developed and maintained\nby Stefan Erhardt and Max Berger. Technologically, the project is remarkable\nbecause it is the only actively maintained style written directly in Mapnik\nXML. This makes editing the style rather awkward but compared to CartoCSS\nbased styles it has the advantage that it can make full use of the Mapnik\nfeature set while CartoCSS styles are limited to the subset of Mapnik features\nsupported by Carto.\n\nDesign wise OpenTopoMap is different from other OSM map styles because it aims\nto resemble and follow many of the design paradigms of traditional topographic\nmaps. This means in particular deliberately using only a limited set of\ncolors. But it goes beyond a mere imitation of traditional maps, it extends\nthe traditional design paradigms with OSM specific ideas.\n\nOpenTopoMap also features a number of other substantial innovations:\n\n  * context dependent orientation of train station and saddle symbols\n  * visualization of view directions of viewpoints\n  * importance rating of peaks and parkings based on isolation\n  * curved labeling of polygons\n\nOpenTopoMap at low zoom levels\n\nOpenTopoMap at higher zoom levels\n\nIn context of maps with relief depiction it is also important to mention the\noldtimer in that context \u2013 TopOSM by Lars Ahlzen. The map is no more\noperational and its development ceased more than ten years ago, but it was a\nsignificant step in the development of OSM based maps with relief depiction.\n\nThe historic TopOSM style\n\nAnother noteworthy contributor to the OSM map design ecosystem is the style of\nfreemap.sk \u2013 an outdoor oriented map style that is written in a unique mixture\nof TypeScript and Mapnik XML by Martin \u017ddila. It is one of the most carefully\ndesigned OSM based map styles with relief shading (which is otherwise often\nnot very well executed in Mapnik based styles)\n\nThe freemap.sk outdoor map style\n\nThen we have as a relative newcomer to the field of OSM based maps, the\nOpenStreetMap Americana project. This is a client side rendered style based on\nthe commercially developed and maintained OpenMapTiles data schema. Because\nOpenStreetMap Americana has been newly created and not derived from a pre-\nexisting map style it is not yet really a complete map style. Technically, it\nis fairly unique as a style written in Javascript \u2013 some would even say it is\ntherefore strictly seen not really a map style but a piece of software\nimplementing map rendering on top of Maplibre GL as a rendering library.\n\nIts use of the OpenMapTiles data schema and client side rendering through\nMaplibre GL design wise puts the project relatively close to the post modern\nideas of corporate maps discussed above. Since the US cartographic tradition\nthat Americana tries to connect to in its design even in the pre-digital\nmanifestations has substantial post modern elements (much more than European\ncartography at least) this is a relatively good match. But it is also visible,\nthat despite Americana being a relatively young and not yet feature complete\nproject by its own goals, it already struggles significantly with the\ntechnical limitations of the map rendering framework used and the commercially\ndeveloped data schema it is built on.\n\nOpenStreetMap Americana style\n\nOne particularly noteworthy design innovation of OpenStreetMap Americana is\nthe highway shield library it contains. Pictorial highway shields are an\nimportant component of the US cartographic tradition and Americana meanwhile\ncontains the most extensive collection of highway shield designs in digital\nform, with coverage way beyond the US. This work is unfortunately fairly\nstrongly tied to the Javascript based framework of the style and therefore not\neasy to reuse in other map design projects.\n\nI also want to mention Map Machine by Sergey Vartanov \u2013 which is both a map\nrendering engine and a map style and is noteworthy in particular because of\nthe extensive set of point symbols for a highly differentiated depiction of\nfeatures in the map that competes with the AJT-Style mentioned above in that\nregard.\n\nMap Machine rendering example\n\nAnd finally this list of maps is closed with another rather unusual project \u2013\nthe Stra\u00dfenraumkarte Neuk\u00f6lln by Supaplex030. This is kind of a personal niche\nproject so far, being limited to a small area in Berlin and \u2013 while it is in\nprinciple open source \u2013 not really being suitable for an independent\ndeployment. But it is \u2013 map design wise \u2013 pretty innovative. It is more of a\nfeasibility study on how large scale map design based on OSM data could look\nlike.\n\nStra\u00dfenraumkarte Neuk\u00f6lln\n\n### Conclusions\n\nSo much as a glimpse into the current state of map design in and around the\nOpenStreetMap project. This is not meant as a complete list, more like a cross\nsection with the aim to include most of the projects where major innovation in\nmap design is happening or has happened during the past years in direct\nconnection to OpenStreetMap. Still: If anyone feels that i have missed an\nimportant project please mention it in the comments below.\n\nWhat does this tell us? That there is a reasonable diversity of map design\nwork to be found around OpenStreetMap if you look carefully enough, although\nmuch of this is in a pretty precarious situation. Many of the projects\nmentioned show no or very little activity in recent years and practically all\nof them in some way struggle with the technical limitations of the tools used\nand quite a few resort to pretty exotic methods of script generating style\nrules to be able to develop the design they use. Also worth pointing out is of\ncourse that map design work in and around OpenStreetMap is massively dominated\nby European and North American projects and designers \u2013 much more so than\nmapping and also software development.\n\nThis situation is quite definitely not due to the lack of people interested in\nand with the talent and ambition to work in map design. The problem is that of\nthe countless people that start looking into designing OSM based maps every\nmonth very few reach a level where they actually become innovative and produce\nsomething that is expanding the state of the art in OSM based map design and\ncould therefore realistically make it on the list here. The reason for that is\nthe map design tools we have are universally insufficient for that. Or in\nother words: Essentially, everything that can be reasonably done with the\ntools at hand for map design and map rendering has been already done a long\ntime ago and to actually do something new you typically have to navigate\naround an obstacle course of limitations and flaws in rendering engines and\nstyling languages \u2013 a requirement that a large percentage of to-be map\ndesigners are typically going to pass on.\n\nWhat the main limitations are that, from my perspective, stand in the way of\nmoving map design in OpenStreetMap to the next level and to practically get\ntalented and motivated people into OSM map design, i have explained some time\nago.\n\nI am not going to speculate when and how something along these lines might\nactually happen. Obviously i would very much like to see progress here. But if\nsuch progress should come out of the OSM community (and not \u2013 like most of the\ncurrently used map design and map rendering tools \u2013 originate largely from the\noutside from the investments of commercial map producers) that would require a\nbroader realization from within the OSM community of the necessity to invest\nhere. And that is clearly a long shot.\n\nWhat i am going to do in the next post (which is going to conclude this short\nseries on map design) is explaining a bit where the short term trend in map\ndesign in OpenStreetMap might be heading in light of the recent activities of\nthe OpenStreetMap Foundation around map rendering.\n\nCategories: Geo-Visualization, Reviews | Tags: map design, Openstreetmap |
