It can also help future enterprises, to protect\nthemselves against existing and unknown attacks.\u201d\n\nCISA said Malware Next-Gen is currently providing malware analysis support to\nall US federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial governmental agencies.\nAnalysis is performed by a combination of static and dynamic analysis tools in\na secure environment and results are available in PDF and STIX 2.1 data\nformats.\n\n## Registration required to access results of analysis\n\nWhile the service has been made publicly available, CISA is enforcing account\nregistration in order to be able to access the analysis. Any user (and\norganizations) can submit a threat sample for analysis, but will need to\nregister to see the analytical results from submissions.\n\n\u201cPlease note, the Malware Next-Gen Analysis platform is a U.S. government\ncomputer and information system,\u201d the agency wrote in an explainer for the\ntool. \u201cTo receive analysis of any malware samples you submit to this system,\nyou will need to create a user account and consent to monitoring of your\nactivities. Access to this system is restricted to authorized users only and\nsubject to rules of behavior.\u201d\n\nUsers who wish to submit malware samples without registering will have to use\nthe \u201cAnonymous submission\u201d option on the login page. Although available behind\na \u201csign-up\u201d wall, the public availability of the tool is being received\npositively by the cybersecurity community.\n\n\u201cThis CISA malware analysis tool will help democratize cybersecurity,\u201d said\nPareekh Jain, chief analyst at Pareekh Consulting. \u201cWhile large organizations\nhave access to sophisticated resources, small organizations and individuals\noften suffer due to a lack of access and an inability to implement\ncybersecurity effectively. With this tool, anyone can access sophisticated\nanalyses of any malware content in files or URLs.\n\n## Related content\n\n  * news analysis\n\n#### Attackers exploit critical zero-day flaw in Palo Alto Networks firewalls\n\nPalo Alto Networks works on hotfixes for GlobalProtect vulnerability and is\naware of \u201climited number of attacks\".\n\nBy Lucian Constantin\n\nApr 12, 2024 3 mins\n\nZero-day vulnerability Vulnerabilities\n\n  * news\n\n#### CISA orders US government agencies to check email systems for signs of\nRussian compromise\n\nThe scope of cyberattack on Microsoft made public in January widens as\ngovernment agencies ordered to assess the scale of Russian compromise.\n\nBy John Dunn\n\nApr 12, 2024 5 mins\n\nIncident Response Security Practices\n\n  * feature\n\n#### Top cybersecurity M&A deals for 2024\n\nThe rise of AI as a component of cyber products, increasing concern over an\nincrease in cyberattacks, and more stringent government regulation could spur\nrobust M&A activity in 2024 after a lackluster 2023.\n\nBy CSO Staff\n\nApr 12, 2024 12 mins\n\nMergers and Acquisitions Data and Information Security IT Leadership\n\n  * PODCASTS\n  * VIDEOS\n  * RESOURCES\n  * EVENTS\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n### From our editors straight to your inbox\n\nGet started by entering your email address below.\n\nby Shweta Sharma\n\nSenior Writer\n\nShweta Sharma is a senior journalist covering enterprise information security\nand digital ledger technologies for IDG\u2019s CSO Online, Computerworld, and other\nenterprise sites.\n\n## Most popular authors\n\n  * Shweta Sharma\n\nSenior Writer\n\n  * Linda Rosencrance\n\nContributing Writer\n\n  * Andy Ellis\n\nAdvisory CISO, Orca Security, and Contributing Writer\n\n#### Show me more\n\nnews\n\n#### CISA opens its malware analysis and threat hunting tool for public use\n\nBy Shweta Sharma\n\nApr 12, 20243 mins\n\nAnti Malware\n\nnews\n\n#### Top cybersecurity product news of the week\n\nBy CSO staff\n\nApr 12, 202477 mins\n\nGenerative AISecurity\n\nnews\n\n#### ISC2 study pegs average US cybersecurity salaries at $147K, up from $119K\nin 2021\n\nBy John Mello Jr.\n\nApr 12, 20244 mins\n\nCSO and CISOSalariesHuman Resources\n\npodcast\n\n#### CSO Executive Sessions: Geopolitical tensions in the South China Sea -\nwhy the private sector should care\n\nApr 02, 202416 mins\n\nCSO and CISO\n\npodcast\n\n#### CSO Executive Sessions: 2024 International Women's Day special\n\nMar 13, 202410 mins\n\nCSO and CISO\n\npodcast\n\n#### CSO Executive Sessions: Former convicted hacker Hieu Minh Ngo on\nblindspots in data protection\n\nFeb 20, 202421 mins\n\nCSO and CISO\n\nvideo\n\n#### CSO Executive Sessions: Geopolitical tensions in the South China Sea -\nwhy the private sector should care\n\nApr 01, 202416 mins\n\nCSO and CISO\n\nvideo\n\n#### CSO Executive Sessions: 2024 International Women's Day special\n\nMar 13, 202410 mins\n\nCSO and CISO\n\nvideo\n\n#### LockBit feud with law enforcement feels like a TV drama\n\nMar 05, 202456 mins\n\nRansomwareArtificial Intelligence\n\nSponsored Links\n\n  * Tomorrow\u2019s cybersecurity success starts with next-level innovation today.
