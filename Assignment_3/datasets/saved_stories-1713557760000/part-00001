Some threaten the\nway we live, like the housing crisis. Others are difficult to solve, like\nspace travel. More still both threaten the way we live and are difficult to\ntackle, like climate change and pollution.\n\nBut of all the discussion of the problems of the modern world, one is often\noverlooked: how do we live happier, more meaningful lives.\n\nI've found that there are two main potential answers which involve the way we\nsleep and the way we work. They are related to the ongoing brain damage of\nmillions of Americans, social media and lighting. By attempting to solve this\nproblem (that of happiness and productivity), all other grand challenges\nbecome easier to solve.\n\nUnlike other grand challenges, like space travel, whose solutions lie in the\nhands of relatively few scientists and administrators, this problem of how to\nlive well is the responsibility of both individuals and businesses.\n\n## Step 1: Sleep\n\nAs a high school student, I had an adversarial relationship with sleep. The\nway I saw it, every minute asleep was a minute of homework not done, a minute\nof friendship not cherished. A minute of life lost.\n\nI went many nights completely forgoing it entirely, believing that it was\nmerely a preview of death. In hindsight, I think it reflects well on my work\nethic, but poorly on my work technique. The ancient Greeks seemed to agree\nwith me. According to them, god of sleep was Hypnos, twin brother of death.\n\nI couldn't have been more wrong, for sleep is incredibly important. In fact, I\nmay have received mild brain damage for my decisions. Sleep is not mere lack\nof activity. In the book Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker, he discusses why\nsleep is critical for living a life containing depth of work and depth of\nbeing.\n\nThere are two types of sleep, and each are equally important.\n\n### NREM (Non-Rapid Eye Movement) Sleep\n\nNREM sleep is critical in the integration and solidification of memory. This\nis the portion of sleep where your eyes are stationary, thus the name. In\nfact, NREM sleep seems to be the only time the brain actively works to retain\nmemory. Since NREM sleep is more prevalent in the earlier hours of the night,\ngoing to bed two hours hours later than usual results in a 69% reduction in\nretention of factual information the next day.\n\n### REM Sleep\n\nREM sleep is pivotal in creative thinking and emotional processing.\n\nWalker models ideas as a knowledge graph. During wakefulness, traversal across\nthis graph for the purpose of problem solving is somewhat isolated. In other\nwords, people who are awake are only thinking of solutions or making\nconnections that are conceptually similar to the existing solutions and ideas.\nDuring REM sleep, however, the brain makes finds longer-distances\nrelationships, from much further-apart sections of the graph.\n\nPTSD patients always have poor quality sleep from to nightmares. It isn't just\na correlation, it is literally required in the diagnosis. Walker claims this\nis because the brain is attempting to process the negative emotions associated\nwith trauma, but, since the emotions are so strong, wakes itself up. One of\nthe main goals with cognitive behavioral therapy for PTSD patients is get the\nvictim through a full night of sleep. By giving the brain the opportunity to\nproperly process the negative experience (in REM sleep), they are able to\ndramatically speed up recovery.\n\nMain takeaway: sleep more and you will live a longer, healthier, more\nimpactful life.\n\nThe need for sleep varies across your lifetime less than many people think.\nThe most desperate need is during infancy, with babies and toddlers requiring\nas much as 18 hours of sleep per day. As you get older, decreases until\nleveling off at eight and half hours of time in bed. No, that is not time\nasleep it is time in bed. It is a myth that seniors require less sleep. In\ntruth, they require just as much sleep as in middle age, but have greater\ndifficulty achieving it. This is primarily due to the correlated difficulty\nbreathing, and secondarily due to the earlier bed-time seniors require.\n\nThere are a number of traits of the modern world that have resulting in the\nWHO diagnosis of sleep deprivation as a pandemic. More than 28% of Americans\nare chronically sleep deprived.\n\n### The Danger of Sleep Deprivation\n\nChronic sleep deprivation can result in brain damage. While you are awake, the\nglymphatic system (which is similar in function, different in implementation\nto the lymphatic system) is inactive. As a result, there is a gradual buildup\nof garbage in the brain, blocking neurotransmitters and generally disrupting\nthe ability for neurons to communicate with each other. One protein that\nbuilds up: beta amyloid, the same protein that causes Alzheimer's disease.\nWhen you sleep, the glymph system starts up and cleans up the garbage\nwakefulness accumulated. However, if not given enough time to do its work (by\nsleeping), the glymphatic system is not able to do its job entirely. This is\nwhy your likelihood of getting Alzheimers increases the less you sleep.\n\nSleep deprivation also causes increased concentrations of cannabinoids. Just\nlike Marijuana, these increases appetite for unhealthy foods. Additionally,\nsleep is an energy intensive process. The body burns more calories at night\nduring sleep than during harmful wakefulness. All in all, there is a very\nstrong connection between sleep deprivation and obesity.\n\nMatthew Walker highlights one especially critical time when physical and\nmental health (especially memory retention) are important: school. The primary\ngoal of school is to learn, to which NREM sleep is critical (due to its role\nin memory retention).\n\nStarting in middle school, children's circadian rhythms start to shift later.\nIn other words, teenagers naturally fall asleep and wake up later than other\nage groups. Walker attributes this to the need for teens to become more\nindependent. Evolution pushes them to operate by themselves by forcing their\nparents to go to bed earlier.\n\nSchools operate under the circadian rhythms of parents and teachers. 7 o'clock\nin the morning is the ideal time for them, but not for the students. But we\nfind that students don't go to bed any earlier, even though they are forced to\nawake at the same time as their parents. The end result: millions of middle\nand high school students are currently experiencing chronic sleep deprivation,\njust because school starts too early.\n\nThe eating and physical habits developed during one's school years serve as\nthe template for the remainder of their lives. If one spends their developing\nyears under sleep deprivation (which is the case for millions of students in\nthe U.S.) they are learning how to live their life under the influence of\ncannabinoids, all the while getting gradual brain damage from the buildup of\nbeta amyloid.\n\n### Sleeping Pills\n\nAs an aside, I feel the need to address sleeping pills. Do not take them.\n\nThere are currently no medications on the market that induce real sleep. There\nare medications that slow and stop brain function, like Ambien. They do not\nprovide real sleep, and as such do not result in memory integration, emotional\nprocessing or any of the other benefits of sleep. In fact, studies with Ambien\nshow that induced \"sleep\" actually results in a net loss of memory, compared\nwith not sleeping at all. Not only does Ambien stop natural memory\nintegration, it actively causes forgetfulness.\n\n### Phones and Blue LEDs\n\nThe part of the brain that runs your circadian rhythm is called the\nsuperchiasmatic nucleus. This is an extremely small cluster of neurons that\nsits on the intersection of your two optic nerves. It watches for signals of\nblue light. If is any is detected (since the only significant, natural blue is\nfrom the sky) it can safely assume it is day and will slowly adjust itself\nunder that assumption.\n\nPhones and other sources of blue light mess with this process. If your eyes\ndetected any at night, you are guaranteed to sleep worse.\n\nThere are other neurological effects at play. Most activities that take place\non a phone activate the part of the brain called the amygdala, which we most\ncommonly associate with the fight or flight response. When activated, your\nbody prepares itself for survival. It slows or halts digestion, dilates the\npupils and increases metabolism. In other words, prepares your body for\naction, not rest.\n\nThe issue: one of the most commons staples of modern office spaces are the\nrows upon rows of florescent lights. All people working in buildings outfitted\nwith these lights may be experiencing worst quality and quantity of sleep as a\nresult, especially those working later or longer hours.\n\nIn the search for producing deep work and living a full life, getting enough\nsleep is paramount. It is the single most effective move one can make, since\nit makes all other actions more effective.\n\nHowever, as I previously pointed out, success in the new economy relies\nparticularly on deep work, which requires deep focus.\n\n## Step 2: Deep Focus\n\nAt the beginning, I mentioned there are two problems restricting the ability\nfor people to live happy, effective lives. The first was related to sleep, the\nsecond was related to deep focus.\n\nBefore I can explain how to achieve deep focus (according to Cal Newport), I\nfirst need to explain why it is so critical.\n\n## The Information Age\n\nWe like to separate history into ages. The age of the dinosaurs was followed\nby the ice age which was followed by the human age (the Anthropocene).\nGranted, that's an oversimplification, but it highlights the point: we\ndelineate swaths of time with the most important and unique variable at play.\n\nThe industrial age began with the widespread use of the steam engine. With\nsteam engines came factories, and with factories came factory workers.\n\nWe live in a new age, identified by the integration and advancement of\ncomputer and communication technology. We call it the information age. With\nthe information age comes information or knowledge workers.\n\nThis is the subject of Cal Newport's fantastic book, Deep Work: Rules for\nFocused Success in a Distracted World.\n\n## Knowledge Work\n\nKnowledge work is defined by the need for a depth and breadth of knowledge,\nand a high ability to manipulate it. Programming, writing, accounting, and\nteaching are all examples of knowledge work. They require enormous amounts of\nknowledge and the value the provide is accomplished through thought.\n\nCal Newport makes the case that the globalization of knowledge (via the\ninternet) has initiated an economic shift that will benefit just a few\nknowledge workers, the most skilled superlinearly relative to the rest.\n\nBefore the internet, any given company had a limited pool of potential\nworkers: those in the geographic vicinity. This meant, if a company wanted to\nhire the best programmer for a job, they would have to make do with what was\navailable.\n\nToday, however, if a company wants to hire the best programmer, they have the\nentire world's pool. Knowledge work doesn't typically have a strict on-site\nrequirement. Companies also have much more to gain from getting the best than\ngetting pretty good, so they're willing to pay much more. The end result: the\npeople at the top of their field are in higher demand now than ever before.\n\nCal Newport identifies two key traits in these \"superstars\" at the top of\ntheir field. First, \"the ability to quickly master hard things.\" In other\nwords, learn complex and applicable things.\n\nSecond, \"the ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality\nand speed.\"\n\nAll of this is to say: to be successful in the changing economy, people need\nto become better at deep, meaningful work. Since the most valuable resources\nare the result of deep thought, it makes sense that the highest achievers are\nthose who practice deep focus.\n\nIn Deep Work, Cal Newport highlights a number of strategies for achieving\ntrue, deep focus. However, only one is broadly applicable for most people. The\nothers require an often unreasonable amount time set aside, something that\nmost employers do not allow, unfortunately.\n\n### Rhythmic Deep Work Scheduling\n\nThis is most effective strategy for achieving deep focus for most people.\nThere are others Newport highlights in his book, but this is the most\nimportant. Particularly, most people have daily obligations that halt them\nfrom deeply focusing for more than 22 hours. This could be due to your job,\nfamily, or school.\n\nEither way, a number of people have centered on a seemingly simple solution:\nmake a habit. Instead of forcing yourself to make a decision to move into deep\nwork, regularly schedule it.\n\nThe brain has a limited number of deep concentration hours per day (I'm not\nsure why, but I suspect it is related previously described buildup of proteins\nin the brain). Use them up front, when you are least likely to be distracted:\nin the morning.\n\nThis is something I've adopted. I schedule all my classes in the afternoon and\nmost social encounters naturally happen in the evening. This leaves the entire\nmorning dedicated to deep focus. I put my phone out of sight and work,\nundistracted, from 5:45 AM to 11:00 AM.\n\nSince implementing this habit, I've found that I'm able to complete the\nmajority of my work twice as fast, leaving more time for other pursuits, like\nHarper.\n\n### The Open Office Plan\n\nThe open office plan it an example of a general trend in many modern\ncompanies. Managers believe the largest barrier to productivity is a lack of\ncommunication. In theory, knowledge workers will be able to complete work\nfaster if they are able to share knowledge faster.\n\nFor example, a junior accountant needs to perform an operation in Excel to\ntabulate a company's expenses for this year. This process, with the knowledge\nthey currently have, will take three hours to perform. They have to write the\nformulas, import in the data, and present it in a graph.\n\nA senior accountant, however, if given the same job, would know that there is\na single button in Excel that does all the same operations in five minutes.\n\nThe friction at play, is that the senior accountant has more knowledge of\nExcel capabilities than the junior. If they could communicate this knowledge,\nthe junior's work could be completed much faster. This is why managers believe\nthat increasing communication increases productivity.\n\nHowever, most attempts to increase productivity have a negative effect on the\nability for knowledge workers to focus, which results in a net decrease of\nproductivity in the team.\n\nFor example: the open office plan. Sure, there may be instances where a senior\naccountant sees that a junior needs help on something, but if any two people\nare talking elsewhere in the room, their noise disrupts the focus of every\nsingle worker present.\n\n### Hub and Spoke Model\n\nThere is one tried and true method of increasing deep focus without\nsacrificing communication: changing the way our buildings are designed.\n\nThe Bell Labs Holmdel Complex is a fantastic example of this. At its peak, it\nwas filled with some of the greatest minds of a generation. Ten Nobel Prizes,\nfive Turing Awards, and twenty-two IEEE Medals of Honor were awarded for work\ndone in this building\n\nThe Holmdel Complex was designed like with a Hub and Spokes. Each worker had\ntheir own private office, so they could work completely uninterrupted. You can\nthink of each office as a spoke on a wheel. However, if they needed to go\nanywhere else in the building, they had to enter the hub: a large hallway that\nconnected all rooms in the building. This meant that chance encounters with\nother workers were commonplace, but only when a worker wasn't actively trying\nfocus. They retained the benefits of both deep work and communication.\n\nThese chance encounters gave rise to unexpected applications of each\nindividual researcher's work. The people working on Unix discovered they could\nhelp the information theory researchers and vice versa.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLet us return to great challenge I'm trying to highlight: the question of how\nto live happier and more effectively. The answers are surprisingly simple.\n\nWe need to schedule our schools and workplaces to account for the needs of\nsleep for our workers and students. Students that remember more material\nbecome more effective problem solvers later on, which makes all other problems\neasier to solve.\n\nThe people who are attempting to solve other great issues, like unequal access\nto education, climate change, and pollution will be able to work more\neffectively given the opportunity to enter deep focus.\n\nSo please, sleep well, and don't be distracted by the things that don't\nmatter.\n\n## Works Cited\n\n[1] M.
