Several\nscientists have launched research projects on solar geoengineering, and some\nsee it as a potential future policy option.\n\nTo us, these proliferating calls for solar geoengineering research and\ndevelopment are cause for alarm. We share three fundamental concerns:\n\nFirst, the risks of solar geoengineering are poorly understood and can never\nbe fully known. Impacts will vary across regions, and there are uncertainties\nabout the effects on weather patterns, agriculture, and the provision of basic\nneeds of food and water.\n\nSecond, speculative hopes about the future availability of solar\ngeoengineering technologies threaten commitments to mitigation and can\ndisincentivize governments, businesses, and societies to do their utmost to\nachieve decarbonization or carbon neutrality as soon as possible. The\nspeculative possibility of future solar geoengineering risks becoming a\npowerful argument for industry lobbyists, climate denialists, and some\ngovernments to delay decarbonization policies.\n\nThird, the current global governance system is unfit to develop and implement\nthe far-reaching agreements needed to maintain fair, inclusive, and effective\npolitical control over solar geoengineering deployment. The United Nations\nGeneral Assembly, the United Nations Environment Programme or the United\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change are all incapable of\nguaranteeing equitable and effective multilateral control over deployment of\nsolar geoengineering technologies at planetary scale. The United Nations\nSecurity Council, dominated by only five countries with veto power, lacks the\nglobal legitimacy that would be required to effectively regulate solar\ngeoengineering deployment.\n\nThese concerns also arise with informal governance arrangements such as multi-\nstakeholder dialogues or voluntary codes of conduct. Informal arrangements\nface barriers to entry by less powerful actors and risk contributing to\npremature legitimization of these speculative technologies. Science networks\nare dominated by a few industrialized countries, with less economically\npowerful countries having little or no direct control over them. Technocratic\ngovernance based on expert commissions cannot adjudicate complex global\nconflicts over values, risk allocation and differences in risk acceptance that\narise within the context of solar geoengineering.\n\nWithout effective global and democratic controls, the geopolitics of possible\nunilateral deployment of solar geoengineering would be frightening and\ninequitable. Given the anticipated low monetary costs of some of these\ntechnologies, there is a risk that a few powerful countries would engage in\nsolar geoengineering unilaterally or in small coalitions even when a majority\nof countries oppose such deployment.\n\nIn short, solar geoengineering deployment cannot be governed globally in a\nfair, inclusive, and effective manner. We therefore call for immediate\npolitical action from governments, the United Nations, and other actors to\nprevent the normalization of solar geoengineering as a climate policy option.\nGovernments and the United Nations should take effective political control and\nrestrict the development of solar geoengineering technologies before it is too\nlate. We advocate for an International Non-Use Agreement on Solar\nGeoengineering specifically targeted against the development and deployment of\nsuch technologies at planetary scale.\n\nThe International Non-Use Agreement on Solar Geoengineering should commit\ngovernments to five core prohibitions and measures:\n\n  1. The commitment to prohibit their national funding agencies from supporting the development of technologies for solar geoengineering, domestically and through international institutions.\n  2. The commitment to ban outdoor experiments of solar geoengineering technologies in areas under their jurisdiction.\n  3. The commitment to not grant patent rights for technologies for solar geoengineering, including supporting technologies such as for the retrofitting of airplanes for aerosol injections.\n  4. The commitment to not deploy technologies for solar geoengineering if developed by third parties.\n  5. The commitment to object to future institutionalization of planetary solar geoengineering as a policy option in relevant international institutions, including assessments by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nAn International Non-Use Agreement on Solar Geoengineering would not prohibit\natmospheric or climate research as such, and it would not place broad\nlimitations on academic freedom. The agreement would instead focus solely on a\nspecific set of measures targeted purely at restricting the development of\nsolar geoengineering technologies under the jurisdiction of the parties to the\nagreement.\n\nInternational political control over the development of contested, high-stakes\ntechnologies with planetary risks is not unprecedented. The international\ncommunity has a rich history of international restrictions and moratoria over\nactivities and technologies judged to be too dangerous or undesirable. This\nhistory demonstrates that international bans on the development of specific\ntechnologies do not limit legitimate research or stifle scientific innovation.\nIn addition, an International Non-Use Agreement on Solar Geoengineering could\ninclude exceptions for less dangerous approaches, for example by allowing the\nuse of localized surface albedo-related technologies that pose few cross-\nregional or global risks.\n\nIn sum, an International Non-Use Agreement on Solar Geoengineering would be\ntimely, feasible, and effective. It would inhibit further normalization and\ndevelopment of a risky and poorly understood set of technologies that seek to\nintentionally manage incoming sunlight at planetary scale. And it would do so\nwithout restricting legitimate climate research. Decarbonization of our\neconomies is feasible if the right steps are taken. Solar geoengineering is\nnot necessary. Neither is it desirable, ethical, or politically governable in\nthe current context.\n\nGiven the increasing normalization of solar geoengineering research, a strong\npolitical message to block these technologies is required. An International\nNon-Use Agreement on Solar Geoengineering is needed now.\n\nRead the Extended Argument Here\n\nBack\n\n## We Call for an International Non-Use Agreement on Solar Geoengineering\n\nTake Action Now\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter!\n\nSubscribe below to receive updates to our intitiative, as well as ways to\nengage further.\n\nFollow our social media\n\nTwitter Instagram\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2021 Solar Geoengeneering Non-Use Agreement.
