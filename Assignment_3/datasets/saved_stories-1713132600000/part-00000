Do you get anxious a lot?\n\nAnxiety comes from a lack of perspective.\n\nIf you\u2019re missing perspective, you can\u2019t see the bigger picture. Perspective\ngives you clarity of thought.\n\nWithout it, you are unable to solve problems. You feel stuck. Negative\nemotions overweigh positive experiences. You feel as if an invisible cloud is\nalways present around you, obsctructing your mental acuity.\n\nYou feel it deep down. You really want to break free, but it feels tough.\n\nI was always called \u2018too serious\u2019. And for good reasons: Because I was. I\nlacked perspective and felt trapped in the mental prison that I created for\nmyself.\n\nYou probably know that feeling because you have it too \u2014 We all do. We get\ncaught up in the daily stress. It feels like we are missing something but we\ncan\u2019t quite grasp what it is.\n\nNow I do.\n\nWhat I didn\u2019t realize, is that I was playing in a game all along. And I was\ndoing it without knowing the rules.\n\nIf you are still feeling the same way, it\u2019s because you haven\u2019t figured it out\nyet.\n\nWe are all playing a game.\n\nThe Game of life.\n\nSome might even say we are living in a Simulation. Whether you believe in this\nor not, it doesn\u2019t matter. The game of life is here. It\u2019s up to you to choose\nto learn the rules, or get left behind.\n\nSo don\u2019t be like me and wait 36 years to discover this.\n\nAs soon as I made that shift, I became more engaged in everything I did. I got\n150% more motivation. Nowadays, I always perform at a higher level. Everything\nis fun, easy and exciting.\n\nWhen things get hard, it\u2019s just fuel for extra motivation.\n\nThe reason I am able to do this is because I finally understood the rules of\nthe game of life. And these rules, I want to teach them to you, because nobody\nelse will.\n\nThink about where we often get our guidance. If you\u2019re like me:\n\nParents were our first teachers.\n\nThey wanted the best for us, but sometimes they didn\u2019t have all the answers.\nThey taught us what they knew which might have not been enough.\n\nSchool was about academics.\n\nMath, science, and more. But it missed the real stuff, like handling the\ncurveballs fo life. Schools fill our heads with facts to remember, rarely with\ncomplete understanding of what\u2019s after.\n\nFriends were on their own path.\n\nThey went to the same schools, had parents from the same generation, and were\njust as busy figuring things out.\n\nTwo things are key here: The first is to realize life is a game, the second is\nto get armed with the unwritten rules.\n\nOnce you do, the challenges that seemed insurmountable become exciting puzzles\nwaiting to be solved. The daily grind transforms into an purposelful quest for\ngrowth and self-discovery.\n\nI want you to picture yourself waking up every morning, not with fear, but\nwith a burning anticipation for the day's challenges.\n\nImagine embracing this anticipation.\n\nVisualize seeing each obstacle as a stepping stone to success.\n\nEnvision commanding your destiny with fearless determination and absolute\nauthority.\n\nThis is what I want you to get from this letter.\n\nBefore, I was stressed. \u2014 All \u2014 The \u2014 Time. I felt like I was aging too fast,\nand I lacked control over my own destiny.\n\nEverything seemed difficult and painful.\n\nNow, I am am having fun. And I am winning the game.\n\nSo learn the rules with me, and win the game of life.\n\n## 1\\. Most of the companies have figured it out. It\u2019s time you do too.\n\nHave you noticed that games are all around you? Even the companies you work\nfor or shop at?\n\nGamification is a proven strategy. It transforms how we work, shop, and\ninteract.\n\nMicrosoft boosted contact center productivity and engagement by introducing a\nsystem of points, badges, and personalized goals.\n\nThe result? A 12% drop in absenteeism and a an increase in productivity.\n\nDating apps have turned the search for a match into an engaging game, with\nmechanisms like:\n\n  * Swipe decisions\n\n  * Rewards for daily logins\n\n  * Achievement Badges\n\n  * Progression systems\n\n  * Personality Quizzes\n\nThrough these gamification techniques, they make the process of finding a\nmatch more entertaining. You are encouraged to spend more time on the platform\nand engage more deeply. '\n\nAnd this isn't limited just to tech giants.\n\nRetailers and workplaces are doing it too. They use leaderboards, points, and\nbadges to motivate and engage employees and customers.\n\nYou see, gamification taps into our natural desires for achievement, learning,\nand socializing.\n\nThe point I am trying to make here is that a lot of companies have figured\nthis out. They are applying gamification to engage and leverage people\u2019s\nnatural desires for things like:\n\n  * self expression\n\n  * socializing\n\n  * learning\n\n  * competition\n\n  * status\n\nBut the draw towards games goes beyond simple entertainment; it taps into the\ncore of our being.\n\nWhen we engage with points, levels, progress bars, goals, and instant\nfeedback, we're not just participating in a game\u2014we're engaging with a\nfundamental part of what makes us human.\n\n## 2\\. Why are humans drawn to games?\n\nGamification leverages our deepest motivations, and there\u2019s a reason for that.\nTurns out, there are 6 main biological factors that we can trace back to.\n\n1 - Dopamine Release: Playing games triggers the release of dopamine, a\nneurotransmitter associated with pleasure and reward. When you succeed in a\ngame by:\n\n  * Solving a puzzle\n\n  * Completing a level\n\n  * Winning against an opponent\n\n2 - Learning and Brain Plasticity: You have a constant desire to learn and\nexplore. This is supported by your brain\u2019s plasticity. Games stimulate the\ncognitive processes like:\n\n  * Problem-solving\n\n  * Spacial navigation\n\n  * Strategy\n\n  * Quick decision making\n\nWhen you engage in these activities, it enhances your brain\u2019s function and\nneuroplasticity.\n\n3 - Stress Response and Play: Playing games reduces stress levels because the\nrelease of endorphins are stimulated. This is your body\u2019s natural painkillers\nand mood elevators. Animals play too. This is often how they (and you and me),\nlearn social skills naturally.\n\n4 - Competition and Cooperation: This has always been crutial to our survival\nas a species. Games simulate these aspects of social interaction, and they\nactivate ancient brain areas responsible for navigating social hierarchies,\nalliances, and rivalries.\n\n5 - Reward Circuits and Feedback Loops: Games provide immediate feedback and\nrewards. They are designed to exploit the reward circuits effectively. This\ncreates a loop that promotes engagement. Just like finding food, or social\ninteraction.\n\n6 - Risk and Reward Assessment: The prefontal cortex is stimulated when\nstrategy and uncertainty is involved.\n\nBefore we bridge the understanding of our natural attraction to games into the\nreal-world application, I have to bring up about the holy grail of games.\n\nThe ones that are the most addictive, the most rewarding and most lucrative:\nVideo games.\n\n## 3\\. What we can learn from video games.\n\nThe reason I wanted to study them is that they are specifically engineered to\nkeep you engaged so that you stay on the platform for as long as possible in\norder for you to get shown ads, or purchase products inside.\n\nVideo games captivate us in ways real life often doesn't.\n\nI want to specifically pinpoint three aspects that set them apart.\n\n### Video games have better clarity of objectives.\n\nMost of the time, we know exactly what to do. Steps are broken down to smaller\nsteps.\n\nIn real life, it\u2019s more random. You usually don\u2019t know you are playing the\ngame.\n\nYou are born in a random family. You are not given a clear tutorial on what to\ndo, or what the game it. You are expected to figure it out on your own, with\nbarely to no guidance.\n\nWorst part is, people around you tell you to get a good job, settle down, get\na house. There is no clarity on this. There is no clear vision.\n\n### Video games have less friction.\n\nIn a video game, obtaining new skills equates to a couple of clicks on the\nmouse or screen. Let\u2019s take your physical appearance for example. On a video\ngame, you simply get to choose your character type. If you want him jacked,\njust select that option. It\u2019s that easy.\n\nIn real life, things take longer, there is a lot more friction. There are\nmultiple iterations. Things take a lot longer.\n\n  * Finding the right relationship will most likely require multiple attemps.\n\n  * Learning a valuable skill will require time, and often sacrifices \u2014 like choosing to not go out with your friends in order to finish the course you bought.\n\n  * Getting jacked will require you to eat enough protein, and workout consistently.\n\nResults will appear over time, not after a few clicks.\n\n### Video games have less risk.\n\nIf you die in a video game, you just get to start over. It\u2019s that simple.\nRisks are virtual, they don\u2019t have real life consequences.\n\nThere\u2019s this beautiful freedom to mess up, dust yourself off, and dive back\nin. In a game, you're encouraged to leap into the unknown, to explore wildly\nand live out scenarios you'd never dream of in the real world.\n\nReal life has consequences and irreversible paths. It doesn\u2019t offer the same\nluxury. And society, parents, school, friends too often remind us of that.\n\n## 4\\. The Rules of the Game of Life:\n\nAlright.\n\nThe moment you've been waiting for has arrived. Let\u2019s dive in.\n\nHow to become the best player you can be, regardless of the cards you were\ndelt with?\n\nLet\u2019s use the best of video games, apply them to real life.\n\nThe timeless areas we want to master in life are:\n\n  * Health\n\n  * Wealth\n\n  * Knowledge\n\n  * Relationships.\n\nIt\u2019s been like this since the begining of humanity, and will remain like this\nforever. It makes these rules evergreen.\n\n### 1\\. Create Your Character.\n\nShape yourself actively through self-education, reflection, and by aligning\nyour actions with your values and goals.\n\n### 2\\. Create Momentum\n\nLike acquiring houses in Monopoly to generate income, momentum in health,\nwealth, and knowledge is key. Regular effort breeds results.\n\n### 3\\. Foster Persistence\n\nKnowledge. More knowledge, all the time. Read, and write to master your\nthoughts. There is no end to this game. You must never stop learning.\n\n### 4\\. Define what your objectives are.\n\nDefine your goals, and establish steps to get there. Define the reward that\nyou will get for achieving that goal.\n\n### 5\\. Reduce the difficulty.\n\nCreate speficic goals (break down goals to small daily tasks to build\nmomentum). It makes it easy, and it coumpounds.\n\n### 6\\. Control Your Attention.\n\nLearn to control where your attention goes. Avoid comparisons that lead to\nsuffering and focus on what truly matters to you.\n\n### 7\\. Ignore Societal Programming.\n\nThe hand you were dealt at birth doesn't dictate your potential for success.\nHistory is filled with stories of individuals who overcame their beginnings.\n\n### 8\\. Embrace Infinite Paths.\n\nAcknowledge that there are endless choices and paths in life. Like character\ncustomization in video games, you have the power to decide your appearance,\nrole, and most importantly, your actions. So make them count.\n\n### 9\\. Pursue Continuous Growth.\n\nContinuously develop your skills and knowledge to take on more complex\nchallenges. This development is just like leveling up in a game.\n\n### 10\\. Balance Skill and Challenge.\n\nMatch your skills with the challenges you face to keep engaged and avoid\nboredom or overwhelming anxiety. Strive for the next level without skipping\nsteps.\n\n### 11\\. Control your thoughts.\n\nYour thoughts and actions dictate your reality in the game. Adopt positive\nmindset, through both Words and Thoughts. Make this a daily practice, ideally\nbefore starting your day.\n\n## 5\\. Lets talk about Cheat Codes.\n\nJust like in video games, there are cheat codes available in life.\n\nBut while it will have an immediate result, it\u2019s always associated with a\ndownside.\n\nCheating with health when taking steroids will make you grow faster, but will\ndamage your body.\n\nCheating in business will make you money quicker, will end you with fines,\npossibly in jail.\n\nCheating in relationships will give you immediate pleasure, but won\u2019t allow\nyou to have a meaninful relationship. Worse, it will sabotage the foundation\nfor profound connections.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget one of the most important ways to cheat:\n\nCheating yourself - The greatest deception.\n\nThis is the less obvious, but the far too common and damaging one. The one I\nhave struggled with the most.\n\nCheating yourself is a silent thief of joy that will slowly eat you alive. You\nignore your true aspirations, you suppress your inner voice, you mask your\nflaws. These acts of self-betrayal don't just chip away at your happiness;\nthey completely shatter your self-esteem.\n\nThe point is, there is always a way to cheat and temporarily get ahead of the\ngame, but it\u2019s only a matter of time when it sets you back further than where\nyou began.\n\nPlus, isn\u2019t beating a game by playing the rules more rewarding than the\nfeeling of beating it by cheating?\n\n## 6\\. This is not a 0 sum Game\n\nWinning in life doesn't mean everyone else loses.\n\nWhile the the board might be finite, the game goes on forever.\n\nEven the richest or happiest person can't have everything forever. Everybody\ndies one day.\n\nThere are enough opportunities for everyone to win. There is enough money for\neveyone to get rich. There are enough people for everyone to find love.\n\nThe best part?\n\nHelping others win is the fastest way to advance in the game of life.\nSuccesful businesses are succesful because their clients are winning.\nSuccesful relationships are succesful because both parties win.\n\n## 7\\. Final toughts\n\nEmbrace life's game without fear or hesitation.\n\nRecognize that each challenge is not a setback but a step forward in mastering\nthe unwritten rules that govern our paths.\n\nWhen you shift perspective, seeing life not as a series of obstacles but as\nopportunities for growth, everything changes.\n\nYou'll find motivation surges, tasks become engaging, and every day is a\nchance to level up in your personal journey.\n\nApply these rules, see yourself addicted to the game of life.\n\nIn this grand game, you are both the player and the game maker. Remember: The\nrules of life are not to bind you, but to forge within you the power to\ncreate, conquer, and thrive.\n\nDon\u2019t just play to partake \u2014 make your mark.\n\nDon\u2019t just leave your footprints \u2014 leave a legacy.\n\nApply these rules with intention. Challenge the game.\n\nUntil next time.\n\nBen.\n\nPS. If you feel like additional rules could be added, fee free to send me a\nnote. I didn\u2019t make the rules, I simply tried to recognize them and categorize\nthem.\n\n## Footer\n\n#### The Simulation Strategists\n\nEngineer Your Existence.
