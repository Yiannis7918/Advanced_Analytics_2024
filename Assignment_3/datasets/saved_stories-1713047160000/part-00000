But we\u2019ve had no response from Google for several days, and\nwant to explain the situation in more detail.\n\n## Summary\n\nWe merged some changes from our upstream project, Conversations, and we\nsubmitted the new version to Google for review. Before responding, they\nremoved the existing published version from the store. We have submitted a new\nversion (on 10th April) that we believe should satisfy Google, but they have\nnot yet published it or provided any feedback.\n\nThis means that it\u2019s not currently possible for Android users to install the\napp using Google Play. We recommend that you install it via F-Droid instead.\n\n## Workaround for Android users\n\nIf you receive an invitation to Snikket, the Play Store link in the invitation\nwill not work. The best course of action is to install the app using an open-\nsource marketplace instead: F-Droid.\n\n  1. Follow the instructions on f-droid.org to download and install F-Droid.\n  2. Install Snikket using F-Droid.\n  3. After the Snikket app is installed, open your Snikket invitation link again.\n  4. Tap the \u2018Open the app\u2019 button.\n  5. Follow the Snikket app\u2019s instructions to set up your new Snikket account.\n\n## The full story\n\nI\u2019m Matthew, founder of Snikket and lead developer. This is the story of how\nwe arrived at this situation with Google.\n\n### It all began when...\n\nA few months ago, Snikket, along with a number of other XMPP apps, found our\nupdates rejected by Google\u2019s review team, claiming that because we upload the\naddress book entries of users to our servers, we need a \u201cprominent disclosure\u201d\nof this within the app. The problem is... we don\u2019t upload the user\u2019s address\nbook anywhere!\n\nThe app requests permission to read the address book. Granting this permission\nis optional, and the reason is explained before the permission is requested.\nIf you grant the permission, the app has a local-only (no upload!) feature\nthat allows you to \u201clink\u201d your XMPP contacts with your phone address book\ncontacts, allowing you to unify things like contact photos. Contact\ninformation from your address book is never uploaded.\n\nMany messaging apps, such as WhatsApp, Signal, and others, request access to\nyour address book so they can upload them to their servers and determine who\nelse you know that is using their service. Google have decided that\u2019s what\nwe\u2019re doing, and they won\u2019t accept any evidence that we\u2019re not.\n\nWe don\u2019t have telemetry in our app, but we assumed that this feature is\nprobably not used by most people, so we decided to remove it from the Play\nStore version of the app rather than continue fighting with Google.\n\nAmusingly, Google also rejected the update that removed the \u2018READ_CONTACTS\u2019\npermission. Multiple times. It took an appeal before they revealed that they\nwere rejecting the new version it because one of the beta tracks still had an\nolder version with the READ_CONTACTS permission. Weird.\n\nI fixed that, and submitted again. They rejected it again. This time they said\nthat they required a test login for the app. Funny, because we already\nprovided one long ago. I assumed the old test account was no longer working,\nso I made them a new one and resubmitted the app. They rejected it again with\nthe same reason - saying we had not provided valid test account credentials.\n\n> \u201cYou didn\u2019t provide an active demo/guest account or a valid username and\n> password which we need to access your app.\u201d \u2013 Google reviewers\n\nThe weird thing was, when I logged in to that account to test it, I saw that\nthey had logged in and even sent some messages. So they were lying?!\n\nWe submitted an appeal with all the evidence that the account was working, and\ntheir reviewers had even logged in and used it successfully. After some time,\nthey eventually responded that they wanted a second test account. Why couldn\u2019t\nthey just say that in the first place?!\n\nAfter adding credentials for a second account, and using the Snikket circles\nfeatures to ensure they could find each other easily, we resubmitted.\n\nRejected again.\n\nThis time the rejection reason was really the best one so far: they claimed\nthe app was unable to send or receive messages. Rather funny for a messaging\napp that thousands of people use to send and receive messages daily.\n\n### Wait, a messaging app that can\u2019t send messages?\n\nOnce again, I logged into the test account we had provided to Google, and once\nagain saw that they had successfully exchanged messages between their two test\naccounts. We submitted another appeal, with evidence.\n\nEventually they responded, clarifying that their complaint was specifically\nabout the app when used with Android Auto, their smart car integration. I do\nnot have such a car, and couldn\u2019t find any contributor who had, but I found\nthat Google provide an emulator that can run on a PC, so I set that up on my\nlaptop and proceeded to test.\n\nYou won\u2019t be surprised to learn at this point that the messaging functionality\nworked fine. We responded to the appeal, including a screencast I made of the\nmessaging functionality working with Android Auto. They informed us that they\nwere \u201cunable to assist with the implementation\u201d of their policies. Then at the\nend of their response, suggested that if we think the app is compliant, that\nwe should resubmit it for review.\n\nSo we resubmitted the app, which by this point had already been rejected 7\ntimes. We resubmitted it with no modification at all. We resubmitted the\nversion they rejected. They emailed us later that day to say it was live.\n\nHow would I rate the developer experience of publishing an app with Google\nPlay? An unsurprising 1 star out of 5. If I could give zero, I would.\n\n### The removal\n\nBut this was all a couple of months ago. Everything was fine. Until I merged\nsome of the nice things Daniel has been working on recently in Conversations,\nthe app upon which Snikket Android is based. We put the new version out for\nbeta testing and everything was going fine - the app passed review, and a few\nweeks later with no major issues reported, we pushed the button to promote the\nnew version from beta to live on the store.\n\nOn the 8th April we received an email from Google with the subject line:\n\n> \u201cAction Required: Your app is not compliant with Google Play Policies\n> (Snikket)\u201d\n\nI was ill this day, and barely working. For reasons that, if you have read\nthis far, you will hopefully understand, I decided to take up this fight when\nI was feeling better. Confusingly, a couple of days later we received another\nemail with the same subject. At this point I realised with horror that the\nfirst email was not about the new update - they had reviewed the current\npublished version and decided to remove it entirely from the store.\n\nWith Snikket unavailable, anyone trying to add a new Android user to their\nSnikket instance (whether hosted or self-hosted) is going to have a hard time.\nThis is not good.\n\nTheir complaint was that the privacy policy was not prominent enough within\nthe app. They had previously hit Conversations with the same thing. Daniel had\nalready put a link to the privacy policy in the main menu of that app and this\nwas already in the update waiting for their review. They didn\u2019t reject the\nupdate until a couple of days later, and for a different reason.\n\nUnknown to me, Daniel had tried to re-add the \u2018READ_CONTACTS\u2019 permission to\nConversations, hoping that with the new privacy policy link and other\ndisclaimers in place, that would be enough. They had already rejected that,\nand he had removed the permission again. But he did this after I had already\nstarted testing the new beta release of Snikket. The order of events went\nsomething like this:\n\n  * Daniel experimentally re-adds READ_CONTACTS permission to Conversations\n  * I merge Conversations changes into Snikket, and begin beta testing\n  * Conversations update gets rejected due to the permission, and Daniel reverts the READ_CONTACTS change\n  * Without knowing of the Conversations rejection, I promote the Snikket beta to the store.\n  * Google rejects the Snikket update\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that Google rejected only on the permission change. The\ncontacts integration itself was still disabled in Snikket. This is strong\nevidence that Google just assumes that if you have the permission (and\npresumably network permission too) then of course you must be uploading the\nuser\u2019s contacts somewhere.\n\nAs soon as I realised the problem, I merged the new changes from Conversations\nand rushed a new upload to Google Play. However at the time of writing this,\nseveral days later, Snikket remains unavailable in the store and no feedback\nhas been received from Google.\n\n### This is an unsustainable situation\n\nDuring this period we have had multiple people sign up for hosted Snikket\ninstances, and then cancel shortly after. This is almost certainly because a\nvital step of the onboarding process (installing the app) is currently broken.\nThis is providing a bad experience for our users and customers, negatively\naffecting the project\u2019s reputation and income.\n\nWe are grateful that alternatives such as F-Droid exist, and allow people\naccess to open-source apps via a transparent process and without the tyranny\nof Google and their faceless unaccountable review team. We need to ensure\nthese projects are supported, and continue to improve their functionality,\nusability and user awareness.\n\nFinally, we also welcome the efforts that the EU has been working on with\nthings like the Digital Markets Act, to help break up the control that\nGoogle\u2019s (demonstrably) arbitrary review process has over the the success and\nfailure of projects, and the livelihoods of app developers.\n\nGoogle, are you there?\n\nBack to top\n\n## Snikket Blog\n\n### Feed\n\nSubscribe to our RSS feed for the latest updates from the Snikket project!\n\n  * Snikket Blog (rss)\n\n### Recent Posts\n\n  * Snikket Android app temporarily unavailable in Google Play store\n  * Security notice: Snikket not affected by CVE-2024-3094\n  * Snikket Hosting is now available!\n  * Snikket Server - January 2024 release\n  * On the jabber.ru MITM attack\n  * State of Snikket 2023: Funding\n  * State of Snikket 2023: The Apps\n  * State of Snikket 2023\n\n### Donate\n\nThis open-source project runs on external funding.
