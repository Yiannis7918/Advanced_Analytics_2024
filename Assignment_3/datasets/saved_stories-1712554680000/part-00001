Her Story\n\nCurated By: Rohit\n\nNews18.com\n\nLast Updated: April 03, 2024, 20:39 IST\n\nAmsterdam, Netherlands\n\nTer Beek, who once aspired to be a psychiatrist, has been dealing with mental\nhealth struggles throughout her life. (@medusach13/X)\n\n## Dutch woman, Zoraya ter Beek, to be euthanized due to severe depression.\nRising euthanasia cases in the West spark debates on mental health care\n\n  * Follow us:\n\nWhatsappFacebookTwitterTelegramGoogle News\n\nA Dutch woman has decided to legally end her life citing her struggles with\ncrippling depression and autism, according to a report. Zoraya ter Beek, a\n28-year-old physically healthy, who lives in a small village in the\nNetherlands near the German border, is slated to be euthanised in May,\naccording to the New York Post (NYP).\n\nEuthanisation refers to the act of intentionally ending the life of a person\nor animal to relieve suffering, typically in the context of terminal illness\nor severe injury. It is often performed by administering drugs or other means\nto induce a painless death. Ter Beek, who does not have much family, has\ngrappled with mental health challenges throughout her lifetime. She has\ndecided to end her life, despite being in love with her 40-year-old boyfriend\nand living with two cats.\n\nThe Dutch woman said she decided to be euthanised after her doctors told her\nnothing more could be done to improve her condition. \u201cI was always very clear\nthat if it doesn\u2019t get better, I can\u2019t do this anymore,\u201d NYP quoted ter Beek\nas saying. Ter Beek, who earlier aimed to become a psychiatrist, is just one\nof the growing number of people in the West who have decided to die rather\nthan continue living in pain.\n\nPeople protest against a law to legalise euthanasia as Spanish Parliament\nvotes to approve it in Madrid, Spain, March 18, 2021. REUTERS/Susana Vera\n\n#### Contentious Issue\n\nSeveral countries have legalised euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide in\nsome form, but the issue remains contentious and is debated by both legal and\nphilosophical luminaries. Some of these nations include the Netherlands,\nBelgium, Luxembourg, Canada, Colombia, Switzerland, Germany, and parts of the\nUS. Notably, the Netherlands was the first country to legalise assisted\nsuicide in 2001. Fast forward to 2022, Dutch media reported 8,720 euthanasia\ndeaths, around 5 percent of all deaths, up from 4 percent the previous year.\nIn February, former Dutch Prime Minister Dries van Agt and his wife died\ntogether by euthanasia.\n\nTer Beek plans to be cremated after she\u2019s euthanised on the couch in her\nliving room. Reports said a doctor will first give her a sedative, followed by\na drug that will stop her heart. Ter Beek\u2019s boyfriend will be at her side\nuntil the end but there will not be a funeral. \u201cThe doctor really takes her\ntime. It is not that they walk in and say, \u2018Lay down, please!\u2019 Most of the\ntime it is first a cup of coffee to settle the nerves and create a soft\natmosphere,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThen she asks if I am ready. I will take my place on the couch. She will once\nagain ask if I am sure, and she will start up the procedure and wish me a good\njourney. Or, in my case, a nice nap, because I hate it if people say, \u2018Safe\njourney.\u2019 I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d Ter Beek said her boyfriend will scatter\nher ashes in \u201ca nice spot in the woods\u201d that they have picked out. \u201cI\u2019m a\nlittle afraid of dying, because it\u2019s the ultimate unknown,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\ndon\u2019t really know what\u2019s next, or is there nothing? That\u2019s the scary part.\u201d\nCritics say that people like Ter Beek have been encouraged to kill themselves\nby the law, with many likening the suicide surge to a contagion, according to\nthe Free Press.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nRohit\n\nRohit is sub-editor at News18.com and covers international news.
