SecureCRT provides secure remote access, file transfer, and data\ntunneling for everyone in your organization.\n\nWhether you are replacing Telnet or Terminal, or need a more capable secure\nremote access tool, SecureCRT is an application you can live in all day long.\nWith the solid security of SSH, extensive session management, and advanced\nscripting, SecureCRT will help raise your productivity to the nth degree.\n\n  * ### Keyword Highlighting\n\nHighlight individual words, phrases, or substrings in the session window to\nidentify errors in log files or streaming output and to highlight prompts.\nRegular expressions are also supported, making it easier to highlight strings\nlike IP addresses. Keyword display attributes (bold, reverse video, and color)\ncan be combined.\n\n  * ### Tabbed Sessions\n\nTabs and tab groups allow you to organize sessions in a variety of ways so\nthat you can get more done in less time. Tabs can be grouped vertically or\nhorizontally, allowing you to compare the output of two sessions, group\nrelated sessions together, or work in one tab while monitoring the output from\na command in another tab and then go back to a single tab group when the\ncommand has finished.\n\n  * ### Command Manager\n\nStreamline repetitive tasks with the dockable Command Manager, which makes it\neasy to organize commands into named folders, filter commands by name, and\nlaunch them with a double click or by pressing Enter. Commands and command\nfolders can also be shared with the button bar and vice versa.\n\n  * ### Scripting\n\nUse Python and ActiveX scripts to save time and automate tasks. Python 3 is\nsupported on Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu Linux. On Windows, edit scripts\ndirectly in a tab without leaving SecureCRT.\n\n  * ### Credentials management\n\nSaving sets of credentials simplifies local password management within\nSecureCRT and SecureFX. Rather than specifying credentials for each saved\nsession, sessions can reference a global set of credentials, making it easier\nto update stored passwords. This is especially helpful when monthly, weekly,\nor even daily password changes are required.\n\n### Key Benefits\n\nSecurely access business applications on UNIX, Linux, or VMS from machines\nrunning Windows, Linux, and macOS \u2014 employ the rich emulation support for\nVT100/102/220, TN3270, ANSI, SCO ANSI, Wyse 50/60, Xterm, and Linux console.\n\nConfigure, manage, and organize all your sessions with full control over\nscrollback, key mappings, colors, fonts, and more \u2014 whether you have one or\nthousands of sessions.\n\nAccess your full array of network devices from one client with SSH (SSH2,\nSSH1), Telnet, Telnet/TLS, serial, RDP (Windows only), and other protocols.\n\nLeverage the high-productivity GUI with time-saving capabilities including\nmulti-session launch, tabbed sessions, tab groups, tiled sessions, cloned\nsessions, a button bar and Command Manager for repeated commands, and mapped\nkeys.\n\nDepend on the open standard Secure Shell (SSH) protocol for encrypted logon\nand session data, flexible authentication options, and optional FIPS 140-2\n-approved ciphers.\n\nAutomate repetitive tasks in SecureCRT by running scripts using VBScript,\nJScript, PerlScript, or Python. The script recorder builds your keystrokes\ninto a VBScript or Python script.\n\nImplement smart cards for highly secure, two-factor authentication. SecureCRT\nsupports X.509 smart cards (PIV/CAC) with the ability to select a specific\ncertificate to be used for public-key authentication.\n\nTransfer files between network devices with SFTP, Xmodem, Ymodem, Zmodem, or\nKermit. A built-in TFTP server provides additional file transfer flexibility.\n\nSave steps with the close integration of SecureCRT and the SecureFX^\u00ae file\ntransfer client, which share sessions and settings that let you run SFTP, FTPS\n(FTP/TLS), HTTPS (WebDAV and Amazon S3), SCP, FTP, and HTTP file transfer\nsessions without reentering passwords.\n\nLearn more about SecureCRT features.\n\nVanDyke products are available for download and evaluation with a 30-day\nevaluation license.
