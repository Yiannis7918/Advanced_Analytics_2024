A solid\nEarth geophysicist at Harvard, he studies the internal structure and processes\nof the Earth, which has implications for fields from climatology to the timing\nof human migration and even to the search for life on other planets. Early in\nhis career he and colleagues showed that Earth\u2019s tectonic plates not only move\nfrom side to side, creating continental drift, but also up and down. By\nrefocusing attention from the horizontal of modern Earth science to the\nvertical, he helped to found what he has nicknamed postmodern geophysics.\nMitrovica has revived and reinvigorated longstanding insights into factors\nthat cause huge geographic variation in sea level, with important implications\nfor the study of climate change today on glaciers and ice sheets.\n\nWe caught up with Mitrovica in his airy office next to Harvard\u2019s renowned\nmineral collection. Though a practiced public speaker and recipient of\nnumerous awards, in person he speaks softly and deflects plaudits. He refers\nfrequently to the colleagues, graduate students, and mentors who have inspired\nhim and contributed to his work.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

That seems surprising.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nThis is just Newton\u2019s law of gravitation applied to the Earth. An ice sheet,\nlike the sun and the moon, produces a gravitational attraction on the\nsurrounding water. There\u2019s no doubt about that.\n\nWhat happens when a big glacier like the Greenland Ice Sheet melts?\n\nThree things happen. One is that you\u2019re dumping all of this melt water into\nthe ocean. So the mass of the entire ocean would definitely be going up if ice\nsheets were melting\u2014as they are today. The second thing that happens is that\nthis gravitational attraction that the ice sheet exerts on the surrounding\nwater diminishes. As a consequence, water migrates away from the ice sheet.\nThe third thing is, as the ice sheet melts, the land underneath the ice sheet\npops up; it rebounds.\n\nSo what is the combined impact of the ice-sheet melt, water flow, and\ndiminished gravity?\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nGravity has a very strong effect. So what happens when an ice sheet melts is\nsea level falls in the vicinity of the melting ice sheet. That is\ncounterintuitive. The question is, how far from the ice sheet do you have to\ngo before the effects of diminished gravity and uplifting crust are small\nenough that you start to raise sea level? That\u2019s also counterintuitive. It\u2019s\n2,000 kilometers away from the ice sheet. So if the Greenland ice sheet were\nto catastrophically collapse tomorrow, the sea level in Iceland, Newfoundland,\nSweden, Norway\u2014all within this 2,000 kilometer radius of the Greenland ice\nsheet\u2014would fall. It might have a 30 to 50 meter drop at the shore of\nGreenland. But the farther you get away from Greenland, the greater the price\nyou pay. If the Greenland ice sheet melts, sea level in most of the Southern\nHemisphere will increase about 30 percent more than the global average. So\nthis is no small effect.\n\n> The last time we were as warm as we are today, the ice sheets that we think\n> of as the least stable disappeared.\n\nWhat happens with melting in Antarctica?\n\nIf the Antarctic ice sheets melt, sea level falls close to Antarctic. But it\nwould rise more than you\u2019d otherwise expect in the Northern Hemisphere. These\nare known as sea-level fingerprints, because each ice sheet has its own\ngeometry. Greenland produces one geometry of sea level change and the\nAntarctic has its own. Mountain glaciers have their own fingerprint. This\nexplains a lot of variability in sea level. It\u2019s also a really important\nopportunity. If you have people denying climate change because they say\nthere\u2019s geographic variation in sea level changes\u2014it doesn\u2019t go up\nuniformly\u2014you can say, \u201cWell, that is incorrect because ice sheets produce a\ngeographically variable change in sea level when they melt.\u201d You can also use\nthat variability to say this percentage is coming from Greenland, this\npercentage is coming from the Antarctic, and this percentage is coming from\nmountain glaciers. You can source the melt. And that\u2019s an important argument\nfrom a public-hazard viewpoint.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nWhy is the source of the melt important?\n\nIf you\u2019re living on the U.S. east coast, or Holland, you don\u2019t need to worry\nwhat global average sea-level rise is doing. I was in Holland a few summers\nago and was trying to convince the Dutch that if the Greenland ice sheet\nmelts, they have less to worry about than the Antarctic ice sheet melting. But\nit doesn\u2019t register. When I give public talks, people just shake their heads.\nThey don\u2019t believe it when I show this bull\u2019s-eye around the melting\n[Greenland] ice sheet, which is an area where sea level will fall. Our\nintuition is built from walking along a shoreline or turning a tap on. It\nisn\u2019t from considering what would happen if a major large-scale ice sheet\nmelts.\n\nRISE AND FALL: A melting ice sheet has two effects on sea level. Diminished\ngravitational attraction lowers the sea near an ice sheet. At the same time,\nwater flowing into the ocean raises it. So if the Greenland ice sheet\ncollapsed into the sea, the melt water would dramatically raise global sea\nlevels. But nearby countries would see sea levels dip. Graphic by Simon\nWerdmuller, courtesy of Maureen Raymo.\n\nWhy are you so confident that the world\u2019s glaciers, including the polar ice\nsheets, will keep melting?\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nOne way to understand where we\u2019re heading in this warming world of ours is to\nrun a climate model. The other way is to look to the past and ask what the ice\nsheets did the last time we were this warm or a little bit warmer. We\u2019re\ncurrently in an interglacial\u2014a warm period between glacial cycles. If humans\nweren\u2019t warming the climate, Earth might be poised to enter into another Ice\nAge in the future. The last interglacial prior to the present one was about\n120,000 years ago. Of course, 120,000 years ago, humans weren\u2019t having any\nimpact on climate. That was natural climatic variability.\n\nWhat did the ice sheets do the last time the climate was this warm?\n\nThe last time we were as warm as we are today, the ice sheets that we think of\nas the least stable disappeared, albeit over a protracted period. So why\nshould we expect that the issue is going to be any different in the next few\nhundreds to thousands of years? There\u2019s no reason to believe it, unless we do\nsomething to reverse what we\u2019re doing.\n\nOK. So we\u2019d expect warming to cause ice sheets to melt and raise sea level.\nBut what\u2019s the evidence that we\u2019re seeing that now?\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nThe average sea level change in the 20th century was 1.2 millimeters per year.\nWhat we\u2019ve seen in the last 20 years is an average of three millimeters per\nyear\u2014that\u2019s a factor of two-and-a-half increase from the 20th century to now.\nSo that\u2019s a nice way to address the skeptic\u2019s argument that it hasn\u2019t changed\nor that it\u2019s not getting worse. It\u2019s already gotten worse. And if you look\nback thousands of years, you have a wide range of tools at your disposal. One\nis eclipse records, and one is the Roman fish tanks.\n\nWhat do Roman fish tanks tell us about sea levels?\n\nWealthy Romans at the time of Augustus were building fish holding tanks. The\nfishermen would come in with the fish, they\u2019d put them there so that the fish\nwere fresh when they ate them\u2014they wanted to keep them alive for a few days or\nweeks or whatever. The Romans were engineers, so they built these fish tanks\nat very precise levels relative to sea level at the time. You didn\u2019t want the\nwalls to be too low because at high tide the fish would swim out; you didn\u2019t\nwant it to be too high because you wanted tides to refresh the water within\nthe tanks.\n\nKurt Lambeck, a professor at the Australian National University, recognized\nthat by looking at the present day elevation of those fish tanks, we could say\nsomething about how sea level had changed over the 2,500 years since then. If\nsea level over the last 2,500 years was going up at the rate that it went up\nin the 20th century, those fish tanks would be under 4 meters of water\u201412 feet\nof water\u2014and I can assure you they\u2019re not. You can see them. You can walk\nalong the coast, they\u2019re visible. What that tells you is that it is impossible\nthat sea level went up by the rates that we saw in the 20th century for any\nextended period of time earlier than that. Sea level has not gone up over the\nlast 2,500 years like it has in the 20th century.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

And you can\ndo that for Greek, Arabic, Babylonian, Chinese eclipses, and this is what a\nprofessor in the U.K., F. Richard Stephenson, did. He tabulated, as others did\nbefore him, a large suite of such eclipses that show a clear slowing of the\nEarth\u2019s rotation rate over the last few thousand years. Say you have two\nclocks synchronized 2,500 years ago. One kept time perfectly and the other was\nconnected to the Earth whose rotation rate was slowing. Over 2,500 years, they\nwould go out of sync by about four hours. That\u2019s kind of the level of slowing.\nSo what we know is that the Earth\u2019s rotation rate has slowed over the last\n2,500 years. But the Earth\u2019s slowing isn\u2019t what we would predict exactly.\n\nWhy would you expect the Earth\u2019s rotation to slow at all?\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nI published this paper in Science Advances on something called Munk\u2019s Enigma.\nWhat we showed is that it comes from three different effects. One is what\u2019s\nknown as \u201ctidal dissipation.\u201d Tides crash into the shoreline and each time\nthey do they dissipate energy, and for a variety of reasons they slow the\nEarth\u2019s rotation. Another thing we talk about is that there is a very subtle\ncoupling between the core of the Earth, which is iron, and the rocky part of\nthe Earth, the mantle, which acts to change the Earth\u2019s rotation rate we see\nsitting on the surface of the planet.\n\nIs it like the friction of the fluid in a car\u2019s a transmission; it has to do\nwith how viscous the connection is between the inner and outer parts of the\nplanet?\n\nIt\u2019s not friction, but it\u2019s pretty darn close. It\u2019s the fact that you\u2019ve got\none fluid moving against another fluid that\u2019s moving at a different rate. If\nthey come out of sync, their rates will influence each other. But it is as you\nsay, a connection.\n\nSo, this is another effect. We have the tides crashing in and what\ngeophysicists would call core-mantle coupling. We can predict both of those\npretty accurately, but you\u2019re still left with a difference and that difference\nis due to the ice age and we model that. We\u2019ve got tidal dissipation, core-\nmantle coupling, and now we add the Ice Age Effect, which I\u2019m the expert on.\nAnd lo and behold, when I add that to these other two effects, I get precisely\nthe four-hour slowing I saw.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nWhat is the Ice Age Effect?\n\nThe Earth is growing more spherical because 20,000 years ago we had a lot more\nice at the poles. When ice sheets were at the poles they kind of squished the\nEarth from both poles and the Earth flattened a little bit. When those ice\nsheets melted, that flattening started to rebound and we\u2019re becoming\nspherical, so our spin rate should be increasing, like a ballerina or a figure\nskater. The ice age correction is a speeding up of the rotation rate.\n\nSo these three factors\u2014core-mantle coupling, post ice rebounding of poles, and\ntidal dissipation\u2014explain changes in the speed of the Earth until the 20th\ncentury. What\u2019s happening now?\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nWe want to take that same ice age model and correct for 20th-century changes\nin Earth\u2019s rotation. When we do, we get a difference that we haven\u2019t explained\nyet. So now we say; well, maybe that\u2019s due to polar ice sheet melting or polar\nglacier melting.\n\nThe way to do that is to go to the IPCC, their last assessment report, and\nlook at the calculation of mountain glacier melting, because those tabulations\nsuggest that the ice sheets weren\u2019t changing that much in the 20th century.\nIce sheets have only really started to melt in the last 20 years or so, but\nthe glaciers were popping off all through the 20th century. We take that\nglacier melting that the IPCC tells us, compute its effect on rotation, and\none effect would be to slow the Earth\u2019s rotation just like the figure skater,\nand compare it to these ice-age corrected observations.\n\nGLOBAL MELTING: Though it may seem counterintuitive, melting glaciers in one\narea may cause local sea levels to drop\u2014while causing a rise in sea levels\nfarther away. Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nIs water moving off glaciers, slowing the Earth\u2019s rotation, this time\nanalogous to a figure skater putting arms out?\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nRight. Glaciers are mostly near the axis. They\u2019re near the North and South\nPoles and the bulk of the ocean is not. In other words, you\u2019re taking glaciers\nfrom high latitudes like Alaska and Patagonia, you\u2019re melting them, they\ndistribute around the globe, but in general, that\u2019s like a mass flux toward\nthe equator because you\u2019re taking material from the poles and you\u2019re moving it\ninto the oceans. That tends to move material closer to the equator than it\nonce was.\n\nSo the melting mountain glaciers and polar caps are moving bulk toward the\nequator?\n\nYes. Of course, there is ocean everywhere, but if you\u2019re moving the ice from a\nhigh latitude and you\u2019re sticking it over oceans, in effect, you\u2019re adding to\nmass in the equator and you\u2019re taking mass away from the polar areas and\nthat\u2019s going to slow the earth down. That\u2019s the calculation we did. We also\ncomputed how those glaciers would affect the orientation of poles. In both\ncases, when you do that calculation and you compare it to this ice age\ncorrected satellite and astronomical observations, you fit them precisely.\n\nWhat we showed in this recent paper is that when you look at the modern data\non rotation and you correct for ice age, you have a leftover, and that\nleftover is precisely what it should be if it were due to the kind of melting\nthat global change scientists believe happened in the 20th century.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

It\u2019s a\nvery good way because if you\u2019re looking at Greenland and you say, \u201cOh, it\u2019s\nmelting in the southern sector, I can see ice diminishing,\u201d you don\u2019t\nnecessarily know what it\u2019s doing in the northern sector. You don\u2019t get a good\nintegrated view of what the Greenland ice sheet is doing. But rotation doesn\u2019t\ncare about north vs. south, it just cares about how much mass is moving from\nGreenland into the oceans. And so rotation provides what a scientist would\ncall a really elegant integrated measure of the mass balance of polar ice\nsheets.\n\nWhat inspired you to become a scientist?\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nIn my family, we had more discussions about Renaissance history than we ever\ndid about science. I\u2019m the only scientist in my family. I went into what\u2019s\ncalled an engineering science or engineering physics program. I took a course\nin plate tectonics in my third year, and I thought, \u201cWhoa!\u201d And my first\npaper\u2014it wasn\u2019t my idea, it was my advisor\u2019s idea\u2014about what caused the\nflooding of the western part of North America 50 to 80 million years ago\u2014that\nwas quite a thrill. You\u2019re a few years into research graduate school, and\nyou\u2019ve just published a paper that explains why North America was underwater,\nthe western part.\n\nWhat is the explanation?\n\nSome said it was some ice effect, that ice volumes had changed. More often\npeople thought that it was linked to changes in the rate at which tectonic\nplates were created. But in my work and that of some colleagues we\u2019ve shown\nthat those sorts of events when continents flood typically are due not to some\nglobal change in sea level. Rather, it\u2019s due to the vertical motion of the\ncontinent itself reacting to the flow that\u2019s driving plate tectonics and\ndriving continents up and down.\n\nSo many of your results seem abstract and counterintuitive. Is that a\ncoincidence?\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nThere are so many interesting problems in our science that you can see with\nyour eyes. But your eyes can fool you. Richard Feynman, the great physicist,\nused to start his physics lectures by showing students their intuition could\ntake them a long way. They could do things just through intuition that would\nget them roughly the right answer. Then he used to throw some counterintuitive\nexamples at them. Then he said, \u201cThis is why you need physics. You need to\nunderstand when your intuition might go wrong.\u201d I firmly am a Feynman acolyte.\nThere are some things that you can explain, but as a scientist you\u2019re always\ngoing to face things that are counterintuitive. You\u2019re never going to\nunderstand that water is falling near an ice sheet from your everyday\nexperiences of the bathtub. You need to bring in something more; in this case,\nNewton\u2019s second law of gravitation. You have to bring in physics; otherwise,\nyou\u2019re never going to explain that.\n\nWhere do your \u201cA-ha!\u201d moments come from?\n\nI think some scientists would disagree with me, but I think you really do have\nto give yourself time to think. You need to have some way in your life as a\nscientist to mull over what you\u2019re seeing. And I strongly encourage my\ngraduate students to have other interests, because the best way to have that\ntime is to take a break from science. I\u2019ve had moments where I\u2019ve seen\nsomething in my models that I\u2019d never seen before and I think, \u201cWell, you\nknow, a good scientist is never going to walk away from that.\u201d A good\nscientist at that point sort of burrows in and says, \u201cWhy am I seeing that?\u201d\nBecause to see the unexpected is the reward of science.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.
