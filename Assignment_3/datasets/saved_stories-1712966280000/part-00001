If you\u2019d like\nto sign up to receive issues over email, you can do so here.\n\nA few days ago, it came out that the CEO of health care goliath UnitedHealth\nGroup, Stephen Hemsley, sold $101.5 million of stock before a government\nantitrust probe of his company became public. Obviously there are unknown\ndetails, but trading on non-public information is a crime. Why would Hemsley\ndo something so nakedly corrupt while under investigation by the Antitrust\nDivision? The obvious answer is he doesn\u2019t expect any consequences. Such an\nattitude is common among executives of prestigious companies, such as Boeing\nand Ticketmaster. They believe themselves above the law. And frankly, they\nusually are.\n\nWhy don\u2019t they get prosecuted? There are many reasons, such as bad Supreme\nCourt precedent, political corruption, and institutional sloth. But one\nlittle-explored problem is that the lawyers and cops at the FBI and Justice\nDepartment who go after the powerful can face serious career sanction. So\nthat\u2019s what I\u2019m going to write about today.\n\nLet\u2019s dive in.\n\n###\n\nPlata O Plomo\n\nIn white collar prosecutor Neil Barofsky\u2019s book Bailout, about the rancid\nbehavior of the Obama administration during the financial crisis, one story\nstands out. Herbert Allison, a well-known Wall Street banker turned political\nappointee, asked Barofksy, who was then attacking the lack of guardrails\naround the use of public money, a question. \u201cHave you thought at all about\nwhat you\u2019ll be doing next?\u201d He then added, \u201cOut there in the market, there are\nconsequences for some of the things that you\u2019re saying and the way that you\u2019re\nsaying them.\u201d\n\nIt was a threat, and Barofsky took it as such. Barofsky had a long career in\nwhite collar prosecution, having gone after both complex financial crimes and\nmajor drug dealers. And Allison\u2019s comments were similar if less violent than\nthose of Latin American drug dealers, who used the phrase \u201cPlata O Plomo,\u201d\nwhich translated as \u2018the silver or the lead.\u2019 That meant you cooperated and\ngot rich, or you didn\u2019t cooperate and got shot.\n\nA few weeks ago, I wrote a piece for paid subscribers on how and why the new\nantitrust regime is different than the previous regimes, showing that FTC\nChair Lina Khan and Jonathan Kanter take multi-billion dollar companies to\ntrial routinely where their predecessors didn\u2019t. Today I want to explain the\ncost of doing so, in antitrust or any other realm where the defendant is a\npolitically connected or wealthy individual. And not the cost in terms of\nbudget, but the cost to the specific careers of the government lawyers who\ntake on the powerful.\n\nWe are all aware of the scenario that Barofsky cited above, where officials in\ngovernment go easy on the powerful so they get good jobs after they leave\npublic service. And that wasn\u2019t just a financial crisis era dynamic; it\u2019s\npretty well-known among prosecutors that if they are aggressive in litigating\nagainst politically connected corporate targets, they will have a tougher time\ngetting a job outside of government. Corporate lawyers argue otherwise, saying\nthat corporations respect people who are hard-nosed litigators in government,\nand want to hire them when they leave. This theory is possible, I suppose,\nthough it does not explain why so many officials hostile to enforcing the law\nget snapped up by big law and big tech firms.\n\nI believe Barofsky, if for no other reason than ambitious lawyers who want to\nget rich aren\u2019t stupid, and if they thought they could do so by bringing\nbillion dollar cases while in government, they would. Instead, they have over\nthe past four decades done the opposite. (The carousel from government to top\nfirms is so routine that the wife of Supreme Court Justice John Roberts makes\nmillions as a recruiter.) When you pull the trigger to block a big merger,\ngood luck working in that industry later on.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that this dynamic is no longer confined to the revolving\ndoor; because of increasing tolerance among judges for nakedly bad faith\nbehavior by rich defense lawyers, line government attorneys can have their\ncareers destroyed just for going after a criminal who happens to be\npolitically savvy.\n\nI\u2019ll start with a story outside the realm of antitrust, a multi-billion dollar\ncase of Medicare fraud in South Florida. And like most Florida stories, had a\nnovelist come up with this, it would not sound believable.\n\n###\n\nBecause Florida\n\nThe main villain is a man named Philip Esformes, a Miami nursing home kingpin,\nwho in 2019 was convicted of the largest health care fraud scheme ever charged\nby the government, having stolen roughly $1.3 billion from 1998 to 2016 by\nmaking bogus claims to Medicare and Medicaid and bribing doctors and state\ninspectors. Esformes lived large, buying Ferraris, luxury watches, and\nprostitutes, as well as bribing officials at the University of Pennsylvania to\nget his son accepted.\n\nThere was plenty of evidence of his crimes, so you\u2019d think going after this\nguy would be a slam-dunk, a career builder for ambitious prosecutors. But as\nyou\u2019ll see, Esformes managed to put Beth Young, the government lawyer who went\nafter him, on trial, and nearly ruined her career.\n\nHere\u2019s how. In 2015, two conspirators of Esformes, Gabriel and Guillermo\nDelgado, were indicted for these schemes, with an added charge of drug\ntrafficking. The Delgados, to ward off a stricter sentence, became informants\nfor the government, and wore a wire, which revealed new crimes. Esformes, for\ninstance, \u201coffered to pay a significant sum of money to [Guillermo] Delgado so\nthat he could flee the United States and avoid prosecution in the United\nStates.\u201d Soon Esformes was indicted, and the FBI raided his facilities,\nincluding where one of his lawyers had an office.\n\nEnter Roy Black and Howard Srebnick, two celebrity South Florida lawyers known\nfor defending high-profile cocaine dealers and famous people in disgrace.\nEsformes hired these men, as much because they are leaders of the clubby Miami\ndefense legal establishment as for their legal acumen. They decided, as such\nlawyers often do, that the best defense was a good offense. And they got an\nopening when Young, the attorney on the case, used a document found in an FBI\nsearch in the office of a lawyer for Esformes, a lawyer the the government\nsuspected was a conspirator.\n\nQuestions of which documents can be used come up a lot in document-intensive\nlitigation, and usually the defense will say \u2018you can\u2019t use that document or\nany information from it,\u2019 the judge rules, and that\u2019s the end of the matter.\nThe particular document at hand wasn\u2019t important, since prosecutors already\nhad records of systemic fraud, and tape recordings of Esformes seeking to\nbribe the co-conspirator. Moreover, prosecutors went by the book, asking\nsuperiors for approval at every step of the way; the FBI even established a\n\u2018taint\u2019 protocol to ensure they weren\u2019t intruding on privileged information\nwhen they conducted their search.\n\nBut Black and Srebnick, financed by Esformes and his Medicare fraud money,\nalleged misconduct, asking the judge to dismiss the criminal charges under the\nsilly premise that three lawyers and one FBI agent had perjured themselves so\nthey could use a document they did not need. The judge, an Obama appointee\nnamed Robert N. Scola, sent the matter to an inexperienced magistrate judge,\nAlicia Otazo-Reyes, to figure out. With stars in her eyes from presiding over\na procedure involving the legendary Black and Srebnick, Otazo-Reyes allowed\nthe defense team to put the prosecutors on the stand for endless amounts of\ncross-examination.\n\nI can\u2019t emphasize how insane this procedure is, but it happened, to the point\nwhere the government lawyers had to hire their own counsel to defend\nthemselves. Eventually, two out of the three prosecutors quit the case. (And\nEsformes\u2019 team then had the gall to argue Young was now conflicted, because\nshe was on trial.)\n\nMagistrate judge Otazo-Reyes, who hadn\u2019t really litigated before, ruled there\nhad been misconduct, dishonesty, and bad faith by the prosecutors. Judge\nScola, seeing the absurdity of what Otazo-Reyes had done, overrode her\nfindings and let the trial go forward. In 2019, Esformes was convicted of 20\nof 26 charges, with the other 6 involving a hung jury. The judge said these\ncrimes were \u201cunmatched in our community, if not our country\u201d and that he\n\u201cviolated [our] trust in epic proportions.\u201d\n\n###\n\nEnter the GOP Establishment\n\nBut that\u2019s not the end of the story. In 2020, on his way of out office,\nPresident Donald Trump pardoned Esformes. As it turns out, the nursing home\nkingpin was well-connected; his clemency appeal had support from high-profile\nGOP establishment legal elites such as Reagan Attorney General Edwin Meese,\nBush Attorneys General Michael Mukasey, John Ashcroft, and Alberto Gonzales,\nas well as former independent counsel Kenneth Starr. I doubt there was\npassionate devotion to the cause of criminal justice; more likely these men\nwere paid for the use of their names.\n\nThen, in 2021, the Department of Justice under Biden decided to go back and\nretry Esformes on the 6 charges that had never been resolved. Esformes tried\nto bring back the allegations of misconduct, which appeared in an Eleventh\nCircuit Court opinion. Ultimately, Esformes pled guilty on one count, and\nthough he paid a fine, he didn\u2019t have to go back to jail, able to enjoy the\nfruits of whatever ill-gotten gains he was able to keep out of the hands of\nthe government. Meanwhile, Young\u2019s name is in an 11th Circuit opinion, not as\na lawyer who won a difficult case, but as someone who was alleged to have\nengaged in bad faith by a magistrate judge.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at the incentives. Rather than getting credit for putting away\na politically connected billion dollar plus fraudster, Young got her names\nsplashed across court opinions alleging dishonesty, misconduct, and bad faith,\nwhich made it hard to get a new job or go to a different part of government.\nShe had to hire a lawyer, on her own dime, to defend herself, and the\nDepartment of Justice had to do an internal investigation simply because of\nthe allegations. (She was cleared.) These kinds of allegations can have\nprofessional consequences, potentially holding up promotions, threatening bar\nlicenses, and damaging reputations. It\u2019s far easier to simply go after\npowerless supplement scammers or irrelevant small time crypto types.\n\nThere are a bunch of bad actors here. Clearly, high-level political officials\nwilling to lend their names for money are gross. Defense lawyers who engage in\na campaign of harassment towards litigators are also overstepping. The Federal\nrules of procedure bar motions meant \u201cto harass, cause unnecessary delay, or\nneedlessly increase the cost of litigation.\u201d But another fundamental problem\nhere is a judge who didn\u2019t sanction these lawyers for what they did, but\nindulged it.\n\n###\n\nIs this Problem Systemic?\n\nBut still, one response to this story is, \u2018so what?\u2019 Esformes is just one guy.\nThe answer is that increasingly, white collar defense firms are now alleging\nmisconduct as part of a defense strategy.\n\nA prosecutor might win, or lose on the allegation, but the point is to put the\nprosecutor on trial. Even when the accusers are the lawyers of a Medicare\nfraudster in league with drug dealing associates, somehow, judges take these\nallegations seriously. They shouldn\u2019t. But because they do, because people\nthink that if there\u2019s an allegation of misconduct against a white collar\nprosecutor, then maybe there\u2019s controversy, it creates an incentive to\nsystemically file allegations of professional misconduct against white collar\nprosecutors. And so that\u2019s what\u2019s happening.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this in the antitrust realm when, say, Amazon demanded that FTC\nChair Lina Khan recuse herself from overseeing it because she published\nacademic work on the firm, or when Google asked a judge to force Antitrust\nchief Jonathan Kanter to withdraw from the trial over allegations of bias.\nBoth failed, but the point was to gin up controversy.\n\nStill, Khan and Kanter are well-known public officials, and there was\nreporting showing that the charges were part of a sleazy political and legal\nstrategy. But when you get into the parts of the bureaucracy where lawyers\nlike Young reside, it\u2019s much lonelier and more difficult to be a line\nprosecutor. And judges are not picking up on the bad faith allegations from\nthe defense bar.\n\nHere are a few examples of how allegations of misconduct are now put forward\nby lawyers for wealthy clients, reported in the niche trade publication\nLaw360, which isn\u2019t a widely known outlet, but is obsessively read by the\nlegal fraternity.\n\nNote how all of these defendants are wealthy and charged with white collar\ncrimes. Defense lawyers know that senior Department of Justice officials, such\nas Garland deputy Lisa Monaco and her team, read these articles in specialized\ntrade publications and panic, worried about how they look. One former senior\nofficial told me he would read the headlines of Law360 every morning just to\nknow what he\u2019d get a call about. Pointing out it was nonsense didn\u2019t matter,\nMonaco would put pressure on those down the ranks because of the fear of a bad\nheadline. Corporate lawyers exploit this dynamic.\n\n####\n\nBIG is a reader-supported newsletter focused on the politics of monopoly and\nfinance.

Instead, the attempt to destroy the reputation and career of\na prosecutor on frivolous grounds is becoming a legitimate grounds for\ncourtroom discussion rather than something for which defense lawyers should be\nsanctioned or disbarred.\n\nThis dynamic is bad for several reasons. The first and most obvious one is\nthat it puts an entire class of people above the law. As someone familiar with\nwhite collar cases told me, \"When the defendants are wealthier the lawyers get\nmore leeway.\" The second is that it creates a bureaucratic pull upward of\nmediocre risk averse lawyers, since those who are promoted are usually those\nwith a spotless record, with spotless increasingly meaning willing to pick on\npoor people.\n\nAnd that legitimizes prosecutorial misconduct towards the poor. After all,\nprosecutors will conclude there\u2019s no point in trying to adhere to universal\nrules, since judges don\u2019t enforce them equally. The only thing that matters is\nwhether the target is rich or poor.\n\nAnd that is why trying to put the CEO of UnitedHealth Group on trial for\ninsider trading seems unimaginable. If a Florida nursing home kingpin with\noodles of evidence of criminality can cause so much trouble, what kind of\nblowback are you going get from trying to get at a genuinely powerful\ncorporate leader if you\u2019re a government lawyer who makes $120,000 a year? It\u2019s\nmuch easier to go after criminals without resources at this point than to risk\nthe professional ruin from taking such a risk. It\u2019s a low intensity version of\nthe silver or the lead.\n\n###\n\nEnding the Chickenshit Club\n\nOne of the simplest ways to fix this dynamic is to just change the culture\ninside government, away from fearing a bad headline. We need political leaders\nwho court controversy rather than avoid it. Donald Trump does this quite well,\nand so does Joe Biden personally, but embracing polarization isn\u2019t unique to\nany political figure. For instance, when the Wall Street Journal editorial\npage published nearly 100 hit pieces on Lina Khan, that became a point of\npride instead of fear.\n\nSo the response to the question \u2018why did a rich guy allege professional\nmisconduct against you?\u2019 should be, \u201cBecause I\u2019m doing a good job. Why hasn\u2019t\na rich guy alleged professional misconduct against you?\u201d And political leaders\nshould seek to fill their administrations with people willing to take such\nchances. There are many other obvious solutions, like educating judges, filing\nbar complaints, doing aggressive public relations on the issue, calling out\ndefense lawyers who abuse their position, and changing the culture of the\nJustice Department.\n\nBut ultimately, if it doesn\u2019t get fixed, the situation where white collar\ncriminals can act with impunity is untenable. Americans no longer believe that\nour system delivers justice, but offers a form of legal amnesty for anyone\nwith power. And while that\u2019s not always the correct assessment, it\u2019s right too\nmuch of the time.\n\nThanks for reading!
