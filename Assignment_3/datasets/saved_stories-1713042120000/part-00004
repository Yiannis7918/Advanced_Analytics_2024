It holds their\nreligious freedoms dear\u2014with a special emphasis on the freedom not to believe.\nThe right to be secular runs like a thread through religious regulations\nenacted this year in Xinjiang, the far-western region that is home to 12m\nUyghurs and other Muslim minorities. The revised rules impose new controls on\neverything from religious teaching to mosque architecture, which should\nreflect Chinese style. The regulations talk of extremists warping minds and\npromoting terrorism. To prevent this, the rules state, no organisations or\nindividual shall induce or coerce locals to believe or not believe in any\nreligion.\n\nThis is in part a euphemism for enhanced controls on religion\u2014in a region that\nat the peak of a security campaign in 2018 and 2019 saw perhaps a million of\nits Muslim residents locked in re-education camps. In part, an old argument is\nbeing revived. The right to believe or not believe is in China\u2019s constitution.\nBut a propaganda line is also taking shape: namely, that harsh rule in\nXinjiang protects its residents\u2019 free will.\n\n#### Already have an account?Log in\n\n## Get the full story\n\n### Enjoy a month of insightful analysis for free.
