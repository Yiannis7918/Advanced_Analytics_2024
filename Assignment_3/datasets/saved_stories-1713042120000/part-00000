We use a trapped-ion quantum server and a client-side\nphotonic detection system networked via a fiber-optic quantum link. The\navailability of memory qubits and deterministic entangling gates enables\ninteractive protocols without postselection\u2014key requirements for any scalable\nblind server, which previous realizations could not provide. We quantify the\nprivacy at leaked classical bits per qubit. This experiment demonstrates a\npath to fully verified quantum computing in the cloud.\n\n  * Received 10 May 2023\n  * Accepted 16 January 2024\n\nDOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.150604\n\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative\nCommons Attribution 4.0 International license.

The\ncomputation is expressed as a sequence of measurements on a brickwork state\n(two-dimensional graph with vertices representing virtual qubits, and edges\nindicating cz gates). The server holds physical memory qubits (orange atoms)\nand one physical network qubit (violet atom). The server can entangle these\nqubits deterministically with each other. The network qubit can also be\nentangled with a photon; by measuring this photon, the client can steer the\nnetwork qubit in the server remotely without the server learning about its\nstate. This allows the client to hide the computation (inputs, outputs, and\ncircuit) from the server. Moreover, the client can verify that the computation\nhas not been tampered with by (randomly) interleaving test rounds, which\nproduce classically simulatable outcomes and cannot be distinguished from the\nactual computation by the server.\n\nReuse & Permissions\n\n  * ###### Figure 2\n\nProtocol used to generate a linear cluster state using a trapped-ion quantum\nserver and a photonic client. The client can steer the network qubit into by\nmeasuring the polarization of the photon in the basis and obtaining as\noutcome. In the initialization step, the server transfers this state onto a\nmemory qubit such that the network qubit can be steered again [21]. Every\nsubsequent interaction step extends the size of the cluster state; the client\nsteers the network qubit remotely into , the server entangles it (cz gates),\nand performs a measurement in the basis , where is provided by the client. See\ntext for details.\n\nReuse & Permissions\n\n  * ###### Figure 3\n\nThe client performs remote state preparation (RSP) using a fast-switching\npolarization analyzer. (a) The control voltages (, ) of two EOMs separated by\na wave plate enable the client to arbitrarily rotate the measurement basis\ngiven by the PBS. (b) Laser light is used to reconstruct this basis for\ndifferent , . Polarization ellipses are shown for the basis states heralded by\ndetector , where the color represents their phase. (c) To find , which\nmaximize the fidelity to each target state needed during the protocol, we\nperform tomography on the network qubit after RSP. The averaged results from\n36 calibrations over 2 weeks are shown in the Bloch sphere representation of\nthe network qubit. Values indicate , with standard deviations obtained from\nbootstrapping.\n\nReuse & Permissions\n\n  * ###### Figure 4\n\nExperimental results on an expanding linear cluster state, where the leading\nqubit is measured in the basis after (a) one and (b) two interaction steps\nbetween the client and the server. (a) While the server observes mixed\noutcomes (squares, test and computation rounds each), for each , the client\ncan decode the results using the secret keys. A fit to the decoded computation\noutcomes (circles) is shown to guide the eye. Error intervals indicate the\nbinomial standard error. The test round errors are significantly below the\nthreshold for verification of a two-node cluster state (dashed line). (b) The\ndecoded outcome is shown for different blind measurement settings, (, ), each\ncomprising computation rounds (see Supplementary Material [32] for interleaved\ntest round results).\n\nReuse & Permissions\n\n1 of 4\n\n\u00d7\n\nSign up to receive regular email alerts from Physical Review Letters\n\n##### More Links\n\n  * APS\n  * Current Issue\n  * Earlier Issues\n  * News & Announcements\n  * About this Journal\n  * Editorial Team\n  * About the Journals\n  * Join APS\n\n  * ###### Authors\n\n    * General Information\n    * Submit a Manuscript\n    * Publication Rights\n    * Open Access\n    * SCOAP^3\n    * Policies & Practices\n    * Tips for Authors\n    * Professional Conduct\n\n  * ###### Referees\n\n    * General Information\n    * Submit a Report\n    * Update Your Information\n    * Policies & Practices\n    * Referee FAQ\n    * Guidelines for Referees\n    * Outstanding Referees\n\n  * ###### Librarians\n\n    * General Information\n    * Subscriptions\n    * Online License Agreement\n    * Usage Statistics\n    * Your Account\n\n  * ###### Students\n\n    * Physics\n    * PhysicsCentral\n    * Student Membership\n\n  * ###### APS Members\n\n    * Subscriptions\n    * Article Packs\n    * Membership\n    * FAQ\n    * APS News\n    * Meetings & Events\n\n  * Privacy\n  * Policies\n  * Contact Information\n  * Feedback\n\nISSN 1079-7114 (online), 0031-9007 (print). \u00a92024 American Physical Society.\nAll rights reserved.
