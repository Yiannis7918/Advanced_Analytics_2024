It was actually invented a little over a century ago, in 1907, by a\nGerman photography pioneer named Julius Neubronner.\n\nNeubronner worked as an apothecary (i.e. an old-school independent pharmacist)\nand used carrier pigeons to rush deliver medications to clients. After one of\nhis pigeons returned four weeks late, Neubronner came up with the wacky idea\nof sticking a camera onto his pigeons in order to glimpse into their\nactivities.\n\nThe Wikipedia article on pigeon photography states,\n\n> Neubronner began the development of a light miniature camera that could be\n> fitted to a pigeon\u2019s breast by means of a harness and an aluminum cuirass.\n> Using wooden camera models weighing 30 to 75 grams [...], the pigeons were\n> carefully trained for their load. To take an aerial photograph, Neubronner\n> carried a pigeon to a location up to about [60 miles] from its home, where\n> it was equipped with a camera and released. The bird, keen to be relieved of\n> its burden, would typically fly home on a direct route, at a height of [160\n> to 330 feet]. A pneumatic system in the camera controlled the time delay\n> before a photograph was taken.\n\nHere\u2019s the nifty little pigeon camera rig that he camera up with:\n\nThis is what Neubronner\u2019s pigeons looked like while in \u201cphotography mode\u201d:\n\nNeubronner filed a patent for his invention in 1907, but was initially shot\ndown after the officials at the patent office didn\u2019t believe domestic pigeons\nhad sufficient carrying capacity for his camera rigs. He appealed by\npresenting some photos taken by his pigeon photographers, and was awarded the\npatent the next year.\n\nHis invention \u201cwent viral\u201d in 1909 after he demonstrated it at the\nInternational Photographic Exhibition in Dresden, Germany (a predecessor of\nPhotokina?). He had his camera-equipped birds fly into the show while\nspectators watched, and then developed the images on the spot to sell as\npostcards. The clever marketing stunt worked, and he quickly received\ninternational attention for the device.\n\nHere are some examples of photographs shot by Neubronner\u2019s birds. The first\nphoto below became quite famous at the time due to the fact that it included\nthe avian photographer\u2019s wing tips:\n\nAlthough there was some initial excitement over pigeon photography (e.g.\nmilitaries exploring the idea for its spying potential), other superior forms\nof aerial photography emerged, causing most people \u2014 even Neubronner himself \u2014\nto abandon the idea.\n\nStill, it appears that there has been a small resurgence of interest as of\nlate, nearly a century after bird photography was first introduced.\n\nEducational, Equipment\n\naerial, aerialphotography, bird, birdphotography, birds, educational, facts,\nhistorical, history, pigeon, vintage\n\nRelated Articles\n\nPhotographer Captures Formal Portraits of \u2018Misunderstood\u2019 Pigeons\n\nA Pigeon Took These Photographs\n\n3 Month Time-Lapse Shows Pigeons Going From Eggs to Adults\n\nRevealing Cold War Espionage Photo Tech: Spy Pigeons, Concealed Cameras, and\nMore\n\nDiscussion\n\nTrending Articles\n\nScientists Photograph 50 Never-Before-Seen Deep Sea Species\n\nApr 12, 2024\n\nThis \u2018Photo\u2019 Was Made From an 84-Year-Old Woman\u2019s Memory\n\nApr 11, 2024\n\nAdobe Will Buy Your Videos for Up to $7.25 Per Minute to Train AI: Report\n\nApr 11, 2024\n\nTourist Falls 170 Feet Off a Cliff to Her Death While Taking Selfie\n\nApr 10, 2024\n\nNight Vision Camera Films Leopard Hunting Baboons in World-First Footage\n\nApr 11, 2024\n\nReading mode: Light Dark\n\n\u00a9 2024 PetaPixel Inc.
