This allows plasmas to be widely used for a variety of\nchemical processes for materials, recycling among others. Because of the\nincrease in urgency to find more sustainable methods of waste management,\nplasmas have been enthusiastically applied to recycling processes. This review\npresents recent developments of plasma technologies for recycling linked to\neconomical models of circular economy and waste management hierarchies,\nexemplifying the thermal decomposition of organic components or substances,\nthe recovery of inorganic materials like metals, the treatment of paper, wind\nturbine waste, and electronic waste. It is discovered that thermal plasmas are\nmost applicable to thermal processes, whereas nonthermal plasmas are often\napplied in different contexts which utilise their chemical selectivity. Most\napplications of plasmas in recycling are successful, but there is room for\nadvancements in applications. Additionally, further perspectives are\ndiscussed.\n\nKeywords:\n\nplasma; recycling; thermal plasmas; nonthermal plasmas; circular economy;\nplasma gasification; plasma reforming\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nAs billions of tons of industrial waste gradually gnaw at the health of the\nenvironment each year, the need to streamline and ameliorate existing\nrecycling processes has become growingly more critical [1].\n\nThere are various types and kinds of waste emitted all over the world. They\ncan be classified by the states of substances, uses, and materials. Taking\nEurope as an example, approximately 25.8 Mt of plastic wastes is generated\nevery year, among which less than 30% is collected for recycling each year\n[2]. The majority of these are considered to be processed by primary\nrecycling. Recycling processes for metals, which often use thermal plasmas,\ngenerally include sorting, squeezing/compacting, and melting in a furnace [3].\nIn 2018, 94 Mt of steel scrap was recycled. Other commonly recycled metals\ninclude aluminium (4.9 Mt), copper (1.6 Mt), lead, zinc, nickel, titanium,\ncobalt, chromium and specialty and precious metals (gold, silver, and\nplatinum) [4].\n\nPlasma, a reactive ionised gas known as the fourth state of matter [5], has\nproved to be very useful in the realm of waste treatment and recycling\nprocesses. Through the lens of recycling models, classifications, and\neconomical models [6], this review discusses cutting-edge advancements of\nplasma technologies in recycling processes and evaluates their successes and\nshortcomings.\n\n## 2\\. Classifications of Recycling\n\nThere are four main types of recycling: primary, secondary, tertiary, and\nquaternary recycling [7,8,9]. These are classified for plastics, but for the\nsake of analysis these definitions will be applied to general waste as well.\nThere are different definitions in different literature, but the most commonly\nused definitions will be presented here.\n\nPrimary recycling is a closed-loop process, where the waste is only broken\ndown to the level where its original chemical structure is not significantly\nmodified [8,9]. It is a simple and cost-effective process. Recycling of\npolyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles is a good example of primary\nrecycling.\n\nSecondary recycling involves downgrading the waste into less valuable\nmaterials [8,9]. Secondary recycling may be less desirable than primary,\ntertiary, or quaternary recycling, but is often otherwise inevitable.\nSecondary recycling is often employed to recycle inorganic substances, which\nare then mixed with concrete for reinforcement, for example.\n\nPrimary and secondary recycling are often collectively referred to as\nmechanical recycling [8,9]. However, this term may cause confusion or\nmisunderstanding, since mechanical recycling generally involves not only\nmechanical processes but also heating and mixing (which may include melting),\nas well as chemical reactions. Hence, since the term is not rigorously defined\nin literature, this expression is not used in the present review.\n\nTertiary recycling refers to chemical recycling and thermal recycling. Thermal\nrecycling, in which the waste is broken down to a molecular level [9] is\ndifferent from combustion. Quaternary recycling involves the thermal\ncombustion of the waste and aims to use the energy generated from this process\n[8,9]. Tertiary or quaternary recycling is often employed for wastes which are\ndifficult to be recycled in a simple manner, often due to their complex\nstructures or contents.\n\nDifferent types of waste disposal models are also explored. First, there\nexists a model known as the waste management hierarchy model, as shown in\nFigure 1. This model ranks the desirability of different types of waste\nmanagement, raking the most desirable at the top and the least desirable at\nthe bottom. Taking plastic as an example and starting from the most preferred\nmethod:\n\nFigure 1. A diagram of the waste management hierarchy model.\n\n  * Reduction (reducing the amount of plastic material produced in the first place);\n\n  * Reuse (reusing the used plastic);\n\n  * Recycling (breaking down the used plastic to its constituent components, corresponding to primary recycling);\n\n  * Recovery (breaking down the used plastic to its molecular components or using them for energy production, corresponding to tertiary recycling, as well as the generation of energy from quaternary recycling);\n\n  * Disposal (throwing away the used plastic).\n\nEssentially, the purpose of this model is not too dissimilar to the circular\neconomy model, which is discussed later: the fundamental concept is to\nminimise the amount of processing i.e., the amount of change required to make\nthe waste reusable again, at least to some capacity.\n\nWhat is recycled and what is discarded as waste depends on what kind of waste\nis being processed. For example, with plastics, one may keep the organic\ncomponents as syngas (a gas mixture of H_2 and CO), while in the recovery of\nmetal waste one often discards organic components.\n\nAdditionally, a circular economy, as depicted in Figure 2, is considered. A\ncircular economy is a circular model of production and consumption, aiming at\nextending the life cycle of products as much as possible [10]. Specifically,\nwaste should be reduced to a minimum, while end-of-life products should be\nkept within the economy by recycling to create further value. The concept of\ncircular economy helps increase the amount of reused or recycled plastic in\nthe overall cycle [11], to ensure that one prevents the needless discarding of\nplastics as much as possible. This is achieved by creating closed loops within\nthe waste management process, and \u201clooping back\u201d with a given piece of waste\nto a given point on the progression, such that as much of the waste goes\nthrough the cycle as possible. As can be seen, secondary, tertiary, and\nquaternary recycling do not form a closed circular loop.\n\nFigure 2. A diagram of the circular economy model.\n\nSomething to consider with regards to a circular economy is that smaller loop\nsizes correspond to higher efficiencies. This is because as the size of the\nloop increases, this inevitably leads to an increase in the energy used in the\nprocesses needed to break down the plastic to its constituent components.\n\nIn this model, extra materials or defective materials produced during the\nmanufacturing process may also be taken into consideration. This is important;\nto start with raw materials that are initially unused makes reprocessing\neasier. Additionally, defective materials found during manufacturing can be\nvery easily processed for recycling, since their components are already known\nby the manufacturer. Environmentally speaking, this results in a net positive;\nwhile the production of waste is inevitable and new materials have to be added\nto the system constantly, using materials of known origin boosts their\nreusability. With regards to the classifications of different recyclable\nproducts, it is also worth mentioning that the circular economy is applicable\nto organic and inorganic substances.\n\nThe four-level classification (primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary),\nwaste management hierarchy, and circular economy are different in a few ways.\nThe four-level classification groups different types of recycling in terms of\nthe process utilised, while the waste management hierarchy groups recycling\nprocesses in terms of their environmental friendliness. On the other hand, the\ncircular economy attempts to describe the dynamic flow of recycling processes.\nTherefore, the processes described in the four-level classification and waste\nmanagement hierarchy appear in the circular economy model. Combining these\ndifferent recycling models helps classify a given recycling process in terms\nof effectiveness, accessibility, and need.\n\nOne major drawback of the circular economy model is that there are many cases\nwhere a loop is not actually formed in the recycling process. Therefore, it\nmust be understood that the circular economy model with a closed loop is an\nidealistic one.\n\n## 3\\. An Overview of Plasma\n\nPlasma is often known as the fourth state of matter that contains electrons,\nions, and radicals [5,12], which in nature can be seen in, e.g., stellar\nstructures [13,14] and the northern lights [15].\n\nIn the waste management community among others, plasmas are generally\nclassified into thermal and nonthermal plasmas. Thermal plasmas, also called\nhigh-temperature plasmas, have high energy densities and are very productive\nin terms of processing speed. In these types of plasmas, the gas temperature\nand the electron temperature are high, and the plasma is at an equilibrium\nstate or is almost at an equilibrium state. Additionally, the gas molecules\ninside a thermal plasma are fully or mostly ionised. Meanwhile, nonthermal\nplasmas, otherwise known as low-temperature plasmas, cold plasmas, or non-\nequilibrium plasmas [16], are only weakly or partially ionised. An important\ncharacteristic of the nonthermal plasma is that the electron temperature is\nmuch higher than those of ions and neutrals, and in fact, in some cases can be\neven higher than the electron temperature in a thermal plasma. The electron\ntemperature in a nonthermal plasma can be, for example, 10^4\u201310^5 K,\ncorresponding to ca. 1\u201310 eV, while the temperatures of the ions and neutrals\ncan be as low as room temperature, or often up to several hundred K [17].\n\nIn the following two subsections, the different advantages and disadvantages\nof thermal and nonthermal plasmas are discussed in detail. In short, thermal\nplasmas are suitable for high-speed processes, while nonthermal plasmas are\nfavourably used for selective chemical processes [18].\n\n#### 3.1. Thermal Plasmas\n\nThermal plasmas can be operated with very high power, and the reaction process\nis also very fast, since the voltage required to sustain them is very low.\nPlasma torches using thermal plasmas are commonly used for waste handling\nprocesses. The main disadvantage of thermal plasma processes is the fact that\nsuch a process is essentially a thermal process, and therefore is has low\nchemical selectivity; if given the opportunity to do so, it will react\nindiscriminately with all target particles. Different configurations for the\ngeneration of thermal plasmas are shown in Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5.\nFigure 3 is the design for a direct current (DC) plasma torch, Figure 4 is the\ndesign for an inductively coupled radiofrequency (RF) plasma torch, and Figure\n5 is the design for a microwave (MW) plasma torch. In all cases, thermal\nplasmas are generated by introducing electrical energy and are extended by a\ngas flow. Waste is then exposed to the extended plasma.\n\nFigure 3. A configuration for a direct current (DC) thermal plasma torch.\n\nFigure 4. A configuration for a radiofrequency (RF) thermal plasma torch.\n\nFigure 5. A configuration for a microwave (MW) thermal plasma torch.\n\nSpark plasma is also a thermal plasma that is similar to an arc plasma. These\ntechnical terms are often interchangeably used. However, arcs are continuous\nwhile sparks are momentary. Spark plasma is generated by applying a pulsed\nelectric field between electrodes.\n\nAn overview of the types of plasma that can be used in recycling processes are\ngiven below in Table 1.\n\nTable 1. Typical plasma parameters of plasma processes in air (values are\nrounded).\n\n#### 3.2. Nonthermal Plasmas\n\nThe main advantage of nonthermal plasma is its selectivity due to its high\nelectron temperature [5]. This means that the desired reaction paths for a\ngiven process can be easily designed using this type of plasma. Since the gas\ntemperature is low, nonthermal plasmas typically do not affect the bulk\nproperties of solids or liquids but interact only with their surfaces\n[5,12,28,29]. Therefore, nonthermal plasmas are preferably applied to surface\n[30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49] or gas\nprocessing [50,51,52,53,54], and their comparative safety to thermal plasmas\nalso make them applicable to medical and oncological processes\n[55,56,57,58,59,60]. In fact, recent progress in plasma treatment of cancer\nmay be considered a worthwhile addition to more popularly addressed cancer\ntreatments like single-cell RNA sequencing [61].\n\nThe main shortcoming, however, is that nonthermal plasmas are unable to take a\nhigh energy density; hence, they are not as productive as thermal plasmas in\nterms of processing speed. Additionally, nonthermal plasmas are often operated\nat low gas pressure at which it is easy to generate such types of plasmas; the\ndownside to this is that low gas pressures require expensive vacuum systems.\nAlthough plasma at atmospheric pressure is desirable, if one attempts to\nincrease the gas pressure, the temperature of the gas and ions in the plasma\ncan easily increase. This is because the increase in gas pressure leads to an\nincrease in the frequency of inelastic collisions between the electrons and\nthe other particles in the plasma. In order to sustain the plasma, the input\npower has to be increased. Therefore, at higher pressures, the heating of the\ngas is accelerated and the nonthermal plasma evolves to a thermal plasma [12]\nat a very high likelihood, although there are several techniques with which\nnonthermal plasma can be stably operated at a high gas pressure\n[5,12,28,29,62].\n\nNonthermal plasmas generally used for processing materials include low-\npressure plasmas and atmospheric-pressure plasmas. Low-pressure plasmas are\ngenerally operated by DC, RF, or MW. Atmospheric-pressure plasmas, which do\nnot require an expensive vacuum system, is preferred for recycling processes.\nAtmospheric-pressure plasmas may be generated using DC (which include pulsed\noperation), high frequencies up to but less than a megahertz, RF, or MW [62].\n\nDifferent types of atmospheric-pressure plasmas have been developed, which\ninclude corona discharge, dielectric barrier discharge (DBD), cold plasma\ntorches, and gliding arcs [28,62].\n\nA corona discharge is generated in a significantly non-uniform electric field,\nusually appearing in the vicinity of sharp edges of electrodes, as can be seen\nin Figure 6. The discharge current must be limited to avoid the plasma\nbecoming an arc. This is done by applying pulsed high voltages, resulting in\nan expensive power supply and low speed processing.\n\nFigure 6. A configuration of corona discharge.\n\nDBD is generated between electrodes by applying an alternating current (AC)\nvoltage. At least one dielectric insulator is inserted between the electrodes\nto block DC. DBD is the most widely used atmospheric-pressure plasma in\nmaterials processing\n[31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,51,63]. Two\nconfiguration of DBDs are known, as illustrated in Figure 7. As in Figure 7a,\na volume discharge is generated at the gap between the electrodes. The gap is\ntypically limited to several millimetres. A surface discharge is generated at\na dielectric material surface with an electrode on each side, or with all\nelectrodes embedded in the dielectric material, like in Figure 7b.\nAlternatively, two electrodes are attached on one side of the dielectric\nmaterial, while the surface discharge is generated on its reverse side. In\nthis case, a surface discharge is achieved by feeding a specific gas such as\nhelium or argon to the reverse side. The frequency required to operate a DBD\nis typically between 500 Hz and 500 kHz, but DBDs at 50 Hz are also reported\n[42]. As the frequency is lowered, capacitive impedance increases at a fixed\ngap, and at a fixed applied voltage the power is lowered. Therefore, in\ngeneral, a higher frequency is preferred for high-speed processing.\n\nFigure 7. Configurations of DBD plasmas. (a) Volume discharge. (b) Surface\ndischarge.\n\nIn most cases, DBDs consist of non-uniform filamentary discharges, and\nsubsequently, the plasma treatment is not uniform. However, it is possible to\ngenerate uniform DBDs, and such a discharge is called a glow discharge. It is\nreported that a filamentary discharge can be avoided by using a noble gas such\nas argon or helium [28,29]. It may also be avoided using short pulses or by\noperating DBDs using RF. When RF plasmas are used, the dielectric is\nunnecessary. However, the operation of DBDs using RF requires an impedance-\nmatching network to deliver RF energy to the plasma, usually limiting high\nvoltage outputs. Due to the limitation of the high-voltage application, the\nelectrode gap must be small enough for the stable operation of the discharge.\nIn this respect, atmospheric-pressure RF plasma is rather preferably developed\nfor cold plasma torches (depicted in Figure 8), which do not require the\ninsertion of a specimen between the electrodes [64,65].\n\nFigure 8. A configuration of a cold plasma torch.\n\nDBD and other plasmas, which are typically capacitively coupled plasmas, can\nbe extended by a gas flow of argon or helium into an ambient air to realise\ncold plasma torches. They are typically weakly ionised [12,28]. A cold plasma\ntorch can be operated at a high frequency (kHz) or RF in a DBD [12], or\nwithout covering electrodes with the dielectrics [12].\n\nIt is desirable that atmospheric-pressure plasma processing demonstrates a\nhybrid condition, which simultaneously achieves high chemical selectivity and\nefficient productivity [12,34,62]. In most cases, neither thermal nor\nnonthermal plasmas are able to provide them simultaneously. However, a gliding\narc can achieve such a hybrid condition [5,12,16,34,62]. A gliding arc, as\nseen in Figure 9, is generated between diverging electrodes, and it is\nextended and quenched by a gas flow\n[12,16,27,63,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77]. Atmospheric-pressure MW\nplasmas can also be generated and extended in a similar way. When the gas flow\nis fast enough to quench the plasma, its properties are similar to those of\nthe gliding arcs [12]. However, using MW is argued to be less economical\n[18,62]. An industrially available open-air technology called technology\n\u201cPlasmatreat^\u00ae\u201d is also a plasma generated as an arc that is extended and\nquenched by a gas flow, and its performance is similar to general gliding\narcs.\n\nFigure 9. A photograph of a gliding arc.\n\n#### 3.3. Terminologies\n\nThere are inconsistencies in the literature regarding the classification of\nplasmas. There are, for example, publications claiming that high-temperature\nplasmas are only seen in stellar structures and fusion reactors and that group\nboth thermal and nonthermal plasmas as low-temperature plasmas [78]. However,\nthis claim requires reconsideration on a few fronts and may be cause for\nconfusion.\n\nFirstly, the claim is semantically undesirable. If thermal plasmas were low-\ntemperature plasmas, they should not be called thermal plasmas in the first\nplace.\n\nSecondly, this claim is fallacious where astrophysical phenomena are\nconsidered. There are stellar prominences known as slingshot prominences,\nwhich are effectively coronal plasma condensations on rapidly rotating stars\n[79]. For the coronae of stars with temperatures at around 10^6 to 10^7 K, the\ntemperatures of slingshot prominences are set at around 8500 K [79,80]. It is\ntrue that the coronae are at very high temperatures, but the temperatures of\nthe prominences themselves can be easily achieved using DC thermal plasma\ntorches, as their maximum temperature is somewhere around 20,000 K [81]. This\nis to say, according to the aforementioned claim, a slingshot prominence at\n8500 K may be considered a high-temperature plasma, while simultaneously a DC-\ngenerated thermal plasma at 20,000 K is considered a low-temperature plasma.\nThese are incompatible, and hence claiming that thermal and nonthermal plasmas\nare both low temperature is inappropriate. If high-temperature plasmas\ncorrespond to an environment of fusion reactions, it is suggested that this\nkind of plasma is called a fusion plasma.\n\nAnother cause for possible confusion regarding plasmas is the fact that plasma\narcs and plasma torches have been differentiated, and plasma arcs have been\ncategorised into transferred arcs and non-transferred arcs [78]. However, it\nis known that transferred and non-transferred arcs are essentially plasma\ntorches [81]. In fact, the plasma torch uses an arc which is extended by a gas\nflow. Furthermore, the technical term \u201cplasma arc\u201d should be avoided, since an\n\u201carc\u201d is an arc plasma. Hence, the categorisation and differentiation of\nplasmas into plasma arcs and plasma torches is unnecessary.\n\nThe term \u201cplasma arc\u201d originated from \u201cplasma arc welding\u201d, which is\nessentially the use of plasma torches. It is speculated that \u201cplasma arc\u201d just\nisolated itself from this term, as it sounds attractive on its own. However,\nin the realm of plasma physics it is desirable to append the word \u201cplasma\u201d as\na suffix rather than a prefix, such as in, e.g., arc plasma, DBD plasma, etc.\n\nTo avoid these confusions in the recent literature, the present review takes\nthe following definitions for plasma:\n\n  * Thermal plasmas refer to high-temperature plasmas, which are at an equilibrium state or almost at an equilibrium state;\n\n  * Nonthermal plasmas refer to low-temperature plasmas which are at a non-equilibrium state, or more specifically, whose electron temperature is much higher than the temperature of the gas.\n\nThese definitions are not unique\u2014they have already been established in other\nliterature reviews [82]. With this background, different types of plasma\nprocesses in recycling are reviewed, in conjunction with different types of\neconomic models.\n\n## 4\\. Thermal Plasmas in Recycling Processes\n\nThermal plasmas are most extensively used in recycling. They include plasma\ntorches and spark plasmas. In both cases, plasma is used to effectively heat\nup solid waste. Plasma torches are commonly employed in plasma gasification\n(see Section 4.1) and metal recovery (see Section 4.2), while spark plasmas\nare used to sinter ceramics (see Section 4.3). Plasma torches are further\nclassified into three different types in terms of their operation frequencies.\nThey are DC, RF, and MW plasma torches as shown in Figure 3, Figure 4 and\nFigure 5. Table 2 summarises the differences in these plasma torches.\n\nTable 2. Comparison of plasma torches used for recycling.\n\nThese are essentially the same with some minor differences, which make them\nsuitable for specific situations. Detailed descriptions are presented in\nSection 4.1 and Section 4.2.\n\n#### 4.1. Plasma Gasification\n\nA commonly used recycling process that utilises thermal plasmas is the thermal\ngasification process. Plasma gasification produces a syngas (H_2, CO) which\ncan be used as a fuel. The process also produces raw materials from which\nvaluable resources, such as hydrocarbons or ammonia, may be synthesised. It is\nevident that this process corresponds to the recovery process in Figure 1, and\ntherefore this is a tertiary recovery process in Figure 2.\n\nThe plasma gasification process is a leading method for solid-waste treatment\n[87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109,110,111,112,113,114,115,116,117,118,119,120,121,122,123,124,125,126,127,128,129,130,131,132,133]\nand has been reviewed quite extensively over the past several years\n[82,94,95,96,99,134,135]. This process, which usually involves thermal\nplasmas, is considered very effective and environmentally friendly\n[109,110,134,136,137,138,139,140,141,142,143,144,145,146]. One important thing\nto note about the plasma gasification process is that it is a purely thermal\nprocess.\n\nWhile there technically do exist gasification processes that do not utilise\nplasmas, many cases where the term \u201cgasification\u201d is used implicitly refer to\nplasma gasification.\n\nDone at high temperatures, plasma gasification entails the thermal\ndecomposition of waste. In the case of inorganic compounds, these are usually\noxidised and turned into slag, which can either be disposed of [147] or reused\nin materials like concrete [148], while the organic compounds are turned into\na syngas which has a double merit; not only is it a fuel, but it is also\ncleaner than its more popular counterparts [87].\n\nSyngas is environmentally friendlier than what is produced in gasification\nprocesses that do not involve plasma, since hydrocarbons are produced for such\nprocesses. The burning of hydrocarbons results in the production of CO_2,\nwhereas burning the hydrogen gas in syngas from plasma gasification only\nproduces H_2O [107]. In the past, CO was also used as a fuel [149], but it has\nrecently been avoided due to its toxicity [150]. It is also worth noting that\nwhile the components in the syngas may be used as a clean fuel, they can also\nbe used to make, e.g., ammonia (NH_3), methane (CH_4), methanol (CH_3OH),\nformaldehyde (HCHO), or formic acid (HCOOH).\n\nA simplified schematic diagram of a typical plasma gasification process is\nshown in Figure 10.\n\nFigure 10. A diagram of the plasma gasification process.\n\nPlasma gasification using thermal plasma involves a plasma torch, in which an\nelectric arc is generated and extended by a gas flow to heat the waste. The\ngas used to extend the electric arc is often air, or oxygen-rich air.\nSometimes, argon (Ar) is introduced as well so that the ignition becomes\neasier at a lower voltage [12].\n\nAs for the plasma itself, its temperature can generally reach around 13,000 \u00b0C\nbut touches the waste in question at a much lower temperature, between 2700 to\n4500 \u00b0C, which is more than enough to decompose the target waste [151].\n\nIn recent publications, one can often find the terms \u201cplasma pyrolysis\u201d and\n\u201cplasma gasification\u201d. Technically speaking, plasma pyrolysis is thermal\ndecomposition of target waste in \u201cthe near absence of oxygen\u201d [152], while the\npresence of oxygen is encouraged in plasma gasification. However, these two\nterms are often used as synonyms [81,82,135,153], and hence they are used\nsynonymously in this review as well.\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5, there are three main types\nof plasma torches that are used for plasma gasification: DC plasma torches, RF\nplasma torches, and MW plasma torches [81].\n\nDue to the availability of large-scale power supplies, DC plasmas are capable\nof generating a power output in the range of megawatts. Their main shortcoming\nis that since the temperature of their arc is so high, the electrodes start to\nerode. Hence, impurities are generated in the arc, and this affects the\nquality of the products which are processed by DC plasmas [81].\n\nRF plasmas can be generated in two ways: it can either be generated as an\ninductively coupled plasma (ICP), or as a capacitively coupled plasma (CCP).\nIn the ICP, the time-varying magnetic field induces an electric field, whereas\nin the CCP, the electric field is directly oscillated. The electron density\ncan be higher in the ICP, whereas with the CCP, a DC self-bias can be\ngenerated with an appropriate impedance-matching network, such that the ions\nin the plasma are accelerated toward the powered electrode. This can be used\nfor physical etching of the target material. One must consider here that in\ngasification, a rise in temperature is necessary; therefore, the ICP is more\nsuitable in this case [154]. If it is an ICP, RF plasmas are operated without\nthe use of an electrode, and hence do not suffer the disadvantage of\ngenerating impurities\u2014the caveat being that they are less efficient compared\nto DC plasma, generating only a few hundred kilowatts [81,135]. Additionally,\nthere are some issues with impedance matching [81,135].\n\nMW plasmas can have a higher plasma density than RF plasmas, and their plasma\nzone can also be much larger [78]. Their other advantages include that they\nare highly effective and only require a \u201csimple and robust\u201d design for their\nreactor [82], while also being a low-voltage operation. Additionally, they do\nnot have any issues with impedance matching, and they do not require\nelectrodes either [135]. These are the reasons why some researchers in the\nfield consider MW plasmas to be the most superior type of thermal plasmas\n[135]. However, MW plasmas do come with their own set of shortcomings. First,\nMW plasmas generate the least amount of power out of the three types; they are\ngenerally able to generate up to only 10 kW of power [81]. Furthermore, while\nthey require the least amount of power in sustaining the arc, the initial\nignition of the arc requires a comparatively high voltage [135] and thereby a\nseparate ignition system, while neither DC nor RF plasma requires this.\n\nIt is interesting to see just how many areas of waste management plasma\ngasification is used in: the treatment of medical waste [141,155,156] and\nmunicipal solid waste (MSW) [142,157], as well as deriving fuel from enhanced\nlandfill mining (ELM) [158] and from the conversion of coal [159] and biomass\n[160,161], as well as plenty more.\n\nHowever, plasma gasification proves to be disadvantageous through the lens of\neconomic viability [113,162]. With regards to this, it is highly debatable\nwhether plasma gasification is necessarily the most efficient method of waste\ndecomposition. As will be discussed in Section 5.1, although low-temperature\nplasma (i.e., nonthermal plasma) may also be used to gasify waste [91,96,118],\nthe plasma gasification process primarily involves thermal plasma which, as\nstated previously, inevitably involves an extremely high processing\ntemperature [96,118]. Additionally, it is not always the case that the waste\nproduct needs to be decomposed into its molecular constituents, at least not\nto the extent that plasma gasification allows. Here, one must take the waste\nmanagement hierarchy model and the circular economy model into consideration.\nIf waste was decomposed to its molecular components every time, the process is\nnot as energy-efficient or as cost-effective as reusing a less-decomposed part\nof the original material.\n\nIn terms of the waste management hierarchy model [163] in Figure 1, plasma\ngasification corresponds to the recovery step, which is far from ideal. In\nother words, purely economically speaking, plasma gasification is not the most\nideal method of recycling using plasmas. However, it is worth noting that the\nmajor advantage of plasma gasification renders the sorting of waste into\nspecific categories unnecessary or at least reduces its need, since the waste\nis decomposed into its molecular constituents anyway.\n\nCurrently, a motivating factor of plasma gasification research seems to be to\nmaintain the high gas temperature while decreasing the input power [135], as\nthe high input power is a major setback of the thermal plasma. However, since\nthis type of plasma is inherently characterised by a high input power and a\nhigh pressure, this is not an optimal solution. One can only hope that the\ntheoretical framework of plasma gasification is further developed to fix its\nsetbacks [82], and that the development of numerical models\n[142,156,157,161,164,165,166,167,168,169,170] will optimise the efficiency and\neffectiveness of this process in the future. For example, it may be\nadvantageous for future numerical methods to simulate a situation in which a\ntemperature limit is set for the plasma discharge, such that the target\nmaterial is selectively thermally decomposed. For instance, selecting an\nappropriate temperature window may facilitate selectivity\n[142,156,157,161,164,165,166,167,168,169,170].\n\n#### 4.2. Recovery of Metals\n\nPlasma processes are also commonly used in the recovery of inorganic\nmaterials. For example, as mentioned earlier, slag can be recovered in the\ngasification process for use in construction.\n\nThermal plasma may also be used in the recovery of metals from waste. Most of\nthese cases involve thermal plasma torches. The recovery of metals also\ncorresponds to the recovery process in Figure 1 and therefore corresponds to\ntertiary recycling in Figure 2. Pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy are\ncommonly used techniques for recycling metal. Pyrometallurgy is a thermal\nrecycling technique that extracts metals from electronic waste, often using\nthermal plasmas. In other words, if pyrometallurgy is employed, a thermal\nplasma process is often involved. Hydrometallurgy is a wet process using\nliquids. It does not require high temperatures but emits significant amounts\nof waste liquids.\n\nFor example, the recovery of metals from household uses, industrial\napplications such as steel, aluminium, and copper, and electronic waste is one\nof the most popular applications of thermal plasma\n[3,171,172,173,174,175,176,177], and it is commonly performed with secondary\nbatteries and waste circuit boards. However, the recycling of secondary\nbatteries is complicated, so it is discussed further in Section 5.3. For waste\ncircuit boards, a plasma torch is used to ensure that the organic molecule\nmacrostructures in the circuit board are destroyed to generate a syngas\n(plasma gasification), and the bonds connecting the metals and fibreglass\nboards are also broken efficiently [172]. However, the main purpose of this\nprocess is not in the generation of combustible gases but rather the recovery\nof metals from the waste. Indeed, the remaining metals exist in a mixture\n[175,177]. This mixture of metals can then promptly be coupled with acid\nleaching and a depolariser to yield desirable metals like copper, aluminium,\nand iron [177]. DC plasma torches are most often used for this process, as the\nhigh temperature improves the separation of the slag metal [175]. In all\ncases, thermal plasma torches are used, similarly to the plasma gasification\nprocess.\n\nThere are of course other applications of plasmas in the recovery of metals\nfrom different types of waste. For example, another application of plasmas in\nthis area is the recovery of pig iron from red mud [178]. Red mud is a\nhazardous residue that is separated from sodium aluminates during the Bayer\nprocess [178,179]. A DC plasma torch is used for this process [178].\n\nSimilarly, electroplating sludges usually come from electroplating plants and\nconsist of a large quantity of heavy metals [180,181]. While metals like\nchromium and nickel among others can be obtained from this waste using\nvitrification [180], in-flight treatment of the waste with a DC plasma torch\nhas also been used to obtain these same metals [182].\n\nFor galvanic sludge, a byproduct of industrial metal surface treatment, a DC\nplasma torch is used for the decomposition [1,175].\n\nLastly, aluminium dross (or slag), which is considered an odorous hazardous\nwaste [1,175,183], may be treated using plasmas. This may achieved by using a\nplasma torch to recover aluminium at a very high efficiency [175,184], or by\napplying an MW plasma torch to produce calcinated alumina [183].\n\nFor a comprehensive review of these processes, consult the review by Changming\n[175].\n\nIt is important to note, however, that some also consider the decomposition of\nzircon to fall under this category [175]. This is not the case. It is indeed\ntrue that zircon refractories may be thermally decomposed using plasmas\n[185,186], but these processes do not belong in this waste decomposition\ncategory as zircon is not waste. Zircon is the source for zirconia, a mineral\nwith many uses [187], and additionally has been considered as one of the\nleading hosts for radioactive waste [188,189]. Hence, zircon is not waste, and\nshould not be considered as such.\n\n#### 4.3. Spark Plasma Sintering\n\nSpark plasma is used to sinter ceramics. The process is called spark plasma\nsintering, which is also called plasma pressure compaction or pulsed electric\ncurrent sintering, and it is additionally referred to as a field-assisted\nsintering technique\n[190,191,192,193,194,195,196,197,198,199,200,201,202,203,204]. Spark plasma\nsintering is a pressure-assisted sintering process, in which a material is\nsubjected to a simultaneous uniaxial pressure and high-intensity pulsed\ncurrent induced by a spark. It is similar to hot pressing, but in spark plasma\nsintering, thermal energy is directly provided to a material by a current flow\nin a plasma. The original concept was proposed in 1912 [205], but its\npractical use started in the 1980s after the first laboratory-scale systems\nwere developed [206]. The development of commercial spark-plasma-sintering\nsystems induced a wide range of use for sintering.\n\nSpark plasma sintering is also applied to waste processes. Spark plasma\nsintering is proposed as a solid-state recycling technique [207], exemplifying\nthe consolidation of aluminium alloy scraps [208]. Calcareous waste concrete\npowder is processed by spark plasma sintering [209], improving the flexural\nstrength and modulus of the sintered bodies. It is reported that rice straw\nagricultural waste can be processed by spark plasma sintering to produce\naluminosilicate matrices for caesium immobilization [210]. Calcium silicate\nmatrices are manufactured from boric acid production waste using spark plasma\nsintering for removing and immobilizing ^60Co [211].\n\n## 5\\. Nonthermal Plasmas in Recycling Processes\n\nNonthermal plasmas are characterised by their high electron temperatures and\nlow gas temperatures, as listed in Table 1. The electron temperature is high\nenough to affect the chemical bonding of molecules, while the gas temperature\nmay be as low as room temperature. They are therefore suitable for surface\nchemical processes and gas-phase chemical processes. Gas-phase reactions in\nnonthermal plasmas typically involve several hundred reactions [212]. On the\nother hand, since the gas temperature is low, nonthermal plasmas do not\nexhibit optimal performance if a thermal process is desired for solids or\nliquids.\n\nNonthermal plasmas may also be applied to waste recycling processes. A number\nof their applications are listed below, and are discussed in detail in the\nfollowing subsections:\n\n  * Plasma reforming;\n\n  * Wind turbine blade recycling;\n\n  * Battery recycling;\n\n  * Paper recycling.\n\nIn short, plasma reforming is an example of gas-phase reactions. In wind\nturbine blade recycling, there has been an attempt to use nonthermal plasma\nfor a moderate thermal process with less success. Recycling processes for\nlithium-ion batteries and papers employ plasma surface modifications.\n\n#### 5.1. Plasma Reforming\n\nPlasma reforming is a very broad term that entails the production of usable\nfuels and raw materials. Reforming is not only used for waste handling, but\nalso the conversion of organic compounds like methane or other hydrocarbons\nand alcohols to hydrogen, syngas, or valuable organic molecules [213,214,215].\n\nPlasma reforming using nonthermal plasmas, at least in the literature,\nconsiders only gas-phase reactions, since bulk properties of solids or liquids\nare not significantly affected by the nonthermal plasma. Plasma reforming\nencompasses both (nonthermal) plasma gasification and plasma liquefaction;\nthese processes are possible using nonthermal plasmas, by tuning the\nselectivity of reactions. The major difference between nonthermal plasma\ngasification and plasma liquefaction is the state of the main product at room\ntemperature, whether it be gas or liquid; otherwise, they are essentially the\nsame. The term \u201cplasma gasification\u201d is mostly used for the thermal plasma\nprocess. To avoid confusion, this review collectively refers to both\nnonthermal plasma gasification and nonthermal plasma liquefaction as plasma\nreforming.\n\nNonthermal plasmas are often used in the production of hydrogen from waste\nplastics [216,217,218,219], or for the conversion of methane [220,221,222,223]\nor other organic materials to hydrocarbons [224,225]. A high selectivity is\nneeded for such a process, and therefore, nonthermal plasmas are desirable.\n\nIt is interesting to see that plasma reforming is often used for the treatment\nof organic materials [224,225,226,227,228,229]. Namely, gasification or\nliquefaction via nonthermal plasmas is often used in combination with biomass\n[230,231]. For example, this process is used to combine biorefinery with the\nchemical recycling of plastics [232], to upgrade biomass vapours so that\nbiofuels may be produced [230], or for the refinery of biomass by removing tar\nfrom it [231]. The last process particularly benefits from the plasma\nreforming process, as the level of tar produced from this process is less than\n0.1% of the level of tar in usual plasma gasification processes [96].\n\nAlthough it is reported that thermal gasification is also used in processes\nlike the decomposition of municipal waste [96], it is in fact an example of\ncold plasma pyrolysis, a thermal process operated at around 600 \u00b0C that\ndecomposes plastic waste with the help of biological catalysts [91,233]. At\nthis range of temperatures, this plasma process is regarded as a nonthermal\nplasma process.\n\nWhile admittedly the energy required for this process is significantly lower\nthan if one were to use thermal plasmas, the same shortcomings regarding\neconomic viability in terms of the two models still apply. This is to say, it\nstill corresponds to the recovery step in the waste management hierarchy model\nin Figure 1. There is also an additional shortcoming regarding the efficiency\nof gasification; since gasification is a purely thermal process, the low\ntemperature of the nonthermal plasma is not advantageous to the speed of this\nprocedure. Hence, gas production using nonthermal plasmas is less efficient\nthan with thermal plasmas.\n\nIt is important to understand that plasma gasification is favourable if syngas\nor hydrogen are desirable products. However, some processes may require the\nuse of syngas as a raw material in an organic compound. Since plasma reforming\nallows for the direct formation of favourable compounds, this is the more\nappropriate process for such instances.\n\nWhile plasma gasification produces a syngas, the corresponding main product\nproduced in plasma liquefaction is liquid fuel. It is evident that this\nprocess, much like plasma gasification, also corresponds to the recovery\nprocess in Figure 1 and is therefore also a tertiary recovery process. The\nproduction of liquids is not possible using thermal plasmas, since the\ntemperatures achieved by thermal plasmas are too high for the target product\nfuel to remain as a liquid that can still be further decomposed.\n\nPlasma liquefaction using nonthermal plasma is a process by which solid\nbiomass is transformed into a liquid form, with the help of catalysts and\nsolvents. This is an attractive process, since producing liquid forms of fuels\nis advantageous [234]. Note the two following reasons. Firstly, in\napplications other than in fuel, there is a preference to keep biomass in a\nform where their molecules are decently large: this usually corresponds to a\nliquid form. Secondly, transportation becomes easier when biomass is in a\nliquid form; the transport of gaseous fuels requires containers that can\nsustain high gas pressures.\n\n#### 5.2. Wind Turbine Blade Recycling\n\nThere are two major challenges in the recycling of wind turbine blades. The\nfirst challenge is that wind turbine blades have a complicated structure, and\nthe separation of components can prove to be quite difficult [235]; therefore,\nprimary recycling of these blades is challenging. The second challenge is that\nwind turbine blades are partially made from fibre-reinforced polymers (FRP),\ntypically with high contents of inexpensive glass fibres.\n\nFRPs are widely used in aerospace and aeronautics [236,237], construction\n[238,239,240], transportation [241,242], and of course, wind energy, among\nmany other areas. This is due to their light weight, environmental\nfriendliness, mouldability, resistance to corrosion, and general mechanical\nproperties [242]. FRPs are mainly composed of two materials: 1. fibres that\nare made of glass, carbon, or natural fibre [243] among others and 2. polymer\nmatrices, which are either thermoplastics or thermosets [244]. The fact that\nthere are various combinations for FRPs provides different challenges in their\ndecomposition and separation. Recycling by way of heating proves to be\nparticularly difficult when thermosets are present in the FRP, as thermosets\nremain hard when exposed to heat [245]. In wind turbine blades, thermosets are\ngenerally used.\n\nThere are two main ways to separate glass fibres: first, by retaining the\noriginal shape of the fibre, e.g., recycling glass fibres by using nonthermal\nplasma, or second, by melting it at a high temperature [244]. In the former\ncase, the physical properties of the fibre are severely degraded, while the\nlatter may only be performed at the laboratory level [241]. Additionally, the\nfact that glass fibre is not so expensive in the first place decreases the\nmerit of melting it, especially considering the cost associated with the\nrecycling process. The volume fraction of polymers in wind turbine blades is\nnot very large. Although polymer matrices in wind turbine blades are much more\nvaluable for recycling than glass fibres, this means that the plasma\ngasification of wind turbine blades produces significant amounts of degraded\nglass while also producing a limited amount of syngas, even in comparison to\nthe regular plasma gasification process, which is unfavourable. Therefore, the\nwind energy community considers that it is cheapest to directly dispose of\nFRPs in landfills, and this is what is done in the majority of cases\n[246,247,248,249]. In this respect, it may be considered that wind energy is\nnot an environmentally friendly green technology. Admittedly, FRPs are also\nused in electronic parts including circuit boards, whose wastes are generally\nhandled by thermal plasma as discussed before. The important difference when\nrecycling electronic wastes is that it primarily aims at recycling valuable\nmetal components.\n\nFrom this, it is not surprising to see that plasmas are not commonly used to\nrecycle FRPs in wind turbine blades. There have been attempts to upcycle the\ncarbon fibre in FRPs via pyrolysis, but the problem is that the upcycled\ncarbon fibre is still degraded in comparison to virgin carbon fibres. Even\nthough the use of thermal plasma somewhat mitigates the amount of\ngraphitization that is usually seen [250], the previous issues regarding heat\ndegradation still stand. However, the recovery of carbon fibres from carbon\nFRPs via chemical swelling and plasma treatment has been performed with\nsuccess; compared to the original fibres, the recycled carbon fibres had\n93.55% tensile strength and 118.76% interfacial shear strength [251].\n\nRecycling entire wind turbine blades has also been attempted [252,253], and\nwhile researchers seem to be hopeful despite the degraded recycled products,\nthe fact that most wind turbine waste is disposed of in landfills suggests\nthat research in this field has proved to be unsuccessful so far.\n\n#### 5.3. Recycling Lithium-Ion Batteries\n\nLithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are referred to as secondary batteries, and are\nwidely used in cars, mobile phones, and the like.\n\nPlasmas are commonly used in the production processes of LIBs\n[6,254,255,256,257,258,259,260,261,262,263,264,265,266,267,268,269,270,271,272,273,274,275,276,277].\nBoth thermal plasmas [278,279,280] and nonthermal plasmas\n[281,282,283,284,285] are used for these production processes. The\nrecyclability of LIBs is limited, and there are also many challenges that such\na process would entail, which include the variety of battery designs and the\nlimitations of current recycling technologies [286,287]. There are many\nexpensive components in a LIB that are preferably recovered rather than\nrecycled, which complicates the recycling process further [286]. Therefore,\ncomponents are selectively recycled, and for LIBs, this is the case for metal\ncomponents.\n\nBroadly speaking, there are two different methods of recycling LIBs:\n\n  * A heat-based smelting process (pyrometallurgy);\n\n  * A liquid-based leaching process (hydrometallurgy).\n\nOf these, smelting is a thermal process for which thermal plasmas are often\nused [288]. However, nonthermal plasmas have also been used to recycle LIBs,\nalbeit very briefly: for example, to heat and combust the byproduct gas in an\nLIB recycling process [287], and the used graphite anode in the LIB has been\nshown to be fully functional after reactivation using a plasma jet [255].\nAccording to the corresponding patent, the temperature of the plasma torch is\n1150 \u00b0C (ca. 900 K) [289]. Such a temperature can be easily achieved using a\nquenched gliding arc. So, in this review, it is assumed to be a nonthermal\nplasma. This process can be broadly considered as a part of recycling\ntechniques, as properties of substances or materials under the subjects are\nsomehow recovered or improved so that they are ready to use and or reuse. On a\ntangent, it is very important to consider that techniques which have\npreviously been considered out of the scope of recycling may potentially be\napplied in relevant recycling processes.\n\nThe latter process would be an example of reuse, as in Figure 1 and Figure 2.\n\n#### 5.4. Paper Recycling\n\nDe-inking used paper is a useful and environmentally conscious process in\nrecycling [290,291] and may be considered a tertiary recycling process that\ncorresponds to the recovery and recycling processes in Figure 1 and Figure 2.\nWhile biological catalysts like cutinases are commonly used [290,291],\nnonthermal plasmas, like atmospheric-pressure helium DBD plasmas, are also\nemployed to speed up these catalytic reactions in recycling [292]. One may use\nMW low-pressure plasma to increase the hydrophilicity of the paper and\ndecrease its disintegration time. This treatment decreases the energy\nconsumption of the de-inking process [292,293].\n\nIn publications that discuss de-inking, references are sometimes made to\n\u201cplasma jets\u201d. This is synonymous to a cold plasma torch, or a nonthermal\nplasma torch. In recent years, it has been discovered that cold plasma torches\nthat use helium are more efficient at increasing the hydrophilicity of\npolymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) [294] than those that use argon. This increase\nin wettability was found through surface characterization techniques, using\nthe contact angle measurements of PMMA with water [294]. When surface\nmodification plays an important factor in finding a solution in recycling\nprocesses, the concepts of surface energy and surface tension, as well as\nsimple surface characterisation techniques such as contact angle measurements,\nare considered to be important\n[295,296,297,298,299,300,301,302,303,304,305,306].\n\nThese examples indirectly assist recycling processes. Enthusiastically\nconsidering these indirect processes as plasma recycling techniques may lead\nto novel applications.\n\n## 6\\. A Critique of Applying Plasmas in Recycling Processes\n\nIn general, thermal plasmas are suitable for thermal processes, while\nnonthermal plasmas better suit applications in surface processes and gas-phase\nreactions. Since each advantage is distinctively different, one possible\nperspective to synergistically combine the processes of thermal and nonthermal\nplasmas in recycling can be to employ a thermal plasma to generate gases,\nwhich are afterwards treated by a nonthermal plasma. Alternatively, after\ninorganic solids are processed by a thermal plasma, their surfaces may be\nmodified by a nonthermal plasma.\n\nBoth thermal and nonthermal plasma processes are known to be environmentally\nfriendly, dry processes that do not use solvents. However, one cannot neglect\nthe expenses induced by employing them into any specific application. The\ninvestment cost including a plasma generator and a chamber usually dominates\nthe expense of the process. It means that if the plasma system used is not\nefficiently used for mass production, the investment cost may become high.\n\nAnother important issue is the use of electricity within the running cost.\nPlasmas used for materials processing are electric gas discharges, which\ninevitably consume a certain amount of electric energy. If the mass\nconsumption of electrical energy is an issue, the use of plasma should be\navoided.\n\nIt is often the case that costs are the major driving force for selecting a\nprocess, and not the effectiveness of the technologies themselves. Since this\nis also the case for recycling processes, it is difficult to foresee future\ntrends. For example, owing to recent serious developments in the generation\nand storage of electricity, as well as technological advancements, the above\nconcerns regarding expenses may become minor issues.\n\nFrom the viewpoints of the recycling classifications discussed in Section 2,\nit is desirable not to destroy waste down to a molecular level, but to\npreserve bulk properties. In this sense, nonthermal plasmas will play a more\nimportant role in solutions of recycling. However, in order for nonthermal\nplasmas to play more important roles in recycling, an overall change is\nrequired with respect to the design, manufacture, and suitability of the\ntreatment to a given process.\n\n## 7\\. Conclusions\n\nWhen thermal plasmas are used for waste management, these are generated in\nplasma torches in all cases excluding spark plasma sintering. While the\nterminology differs from publication to publication, it is seen that the\nprocesses are essentially all the same. It has also been noted that when a\nlarge quantity of waste is thermally processed, this is most efficiently\nachieved by using a thermal plasma; this also helps achieve the maximum\ntemperature. This is because the electrical impedance of thermal plasmas is\nlow, so a high current can be generated from a low voltage. This leads to a\nhigh-power process, in which a high-temperature environment can easily be\nachieved from the Joule heat. With regards to DC, RF, and MW plasmas, if the\ncontamination from the electrodes melting is not a significant issue, DC\nplasmas are the most efficient for large-scale processes.\n\nThe shortcomings of thermal plasmas are that a high power is needed to achieve\na high temperature, and that they need an environment or a container resistant\nto high temperature. It is advisable to consider these limitations.\nAdditionally, the residue waste after gasification will also be exposed to\nhigh temperatures; for cases in which this is not appropriate, it is important\nto select a process that does not reach very high temperatures.\n\nThe number of attempts that use nonthermal plasmas in recycling processes are\nmuch less than for thermal plasmas. This is due to the fact that nonthermal\nplasmas are unsuited for the high-speed processing of bulk solids or liquids.\nHowever, considering their selectivity, gas-phase reactions, and their\naffinity for surface reactions with solids and liquids, there are applications\nthat are able to utilise these advantages.\n\nAlternatively, one may consider nonthermal plasmas in processes that assist\nthe main recycling process. In these cases, nonthermal plasmas may be found to\nbe increasingly more useful. In reality, nonthermal plasmas are already used\nin recycling processes, even if they are not explicitly defined as such. In\norder to improve recycling processes in the future, this may be something\nworth considering.\n\n## Author Contributions\n\nConceptualization, Y.K.; investigation, R.K. and Y.K.; data curation, R.K. and\nY.K.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, R.K.; writing\u2014review and editing,\nR.K. and Y.K.; visualization, R.K.; supervision, Y.K.
