Photograph: davidxgreen/Alamy\n\nArts education is essential \u2013 yet on both sides of the Atlantic, the\nhumanities and critical thinking are under attack. With massive redundancies\nannounced at this London institution, is it the canary in the coalmine?\n\nby Zoe Williams\n\nShare\n\nIt is a couple of days before Easter, and the students who have been holding a\nsit-in in the Professor Stuart Hall building in Goldsmiths, University of\nLondon are packing up. The large basement smells of duvets and camping mats\nand solidarity and liveliness, and deodorant sprayed on in a hurry under a\nT-shirt, and it smells like a place where people have slept, which 20 of them\nhave done since 20 February, with crowds swelling to 100 for spontaneous\nlectures.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a story about idiot idealists making futile gestures: Mark Peacock,\na 28-year-old postgraduate student in the politics department, rattles through\na number of concessions the senior management team at the university has made\nas a result of the action. Yet Danna MacRae, 24, studying for an MA in\necology, culture and society, says the occupation has been greater than the\nsum of its demands: \u201cIt\u2019s about opening up the literal physical space but also\nthe social space to expand political possibilities. So much becomes possible\nwhen you\u2019re living together 24/7.\u201d I read their banner as they\u2019re furling it\nup: among other things, it calls for the university to protect students\u2019 right\nto protest, expand scholarships for Palestinian students and divest from any\ncompany providing equipment to Israel.\n\nThese are by no means extraordinary calls, particularly among students \u2013 many\nuniversities have coordinated protests and motions on Palestine. Besides,\ncalling for an end to the bombardment and starvation of Gaza becomes a more\nmainstream position the longer it goes on. But I\u2019m really surprised, because\nthere\u2019s a whole separate, hot dispute going on at Goldsmiths, and I\u2019d assumed\nthe students were protesting as part of that. The media are really bad at\nexamining two issues at once, particularly if they\u2019re on different scales and\nnot obviously connected \u2013 more than one academic from the media and\ncommunications department explained this to me.\n\nMidway through the occupation, the warden of Goldsmiths, Frances Corner, had\nannounced the so-called Transformation Programme, which would require 132\nmembers of staff \u2013 or the full-time equivalent, so it was expected to affect\nmore than that number of people \u2013 to be made compulsorily redundant. It would\nmean losing 17% of the staff, with some departments \u2013 English and sociology,\narguably their most famous, along with art and politics \u2013 taking hits of 50%.\n\nIt is no exaggeration to say that staff are devastated, gobsmacked. They had a\nhunch that something was about to happen but say that for days ahead of the\nannouncement, Goldsmiths\u2019 council, its governance body, wouldn\u2019t meet them,\nputting them off until the day after it had approved the redundancies, the day\nacademics got the letters. \u201cThey agreed, but we said: \u2018We cannot meet you now\nbecause half of us are having a panic attack,\u2019\u201d says history of art lecturer\nYaiza Hern\u00e1ndez Vel\u00e1zquez.\n\nA teach-in during this winter\u2019s student occupation of Goldsmiths.\n\nMany are at pains to admit that they know \u201cthe glory days of the 80s are no\nlonger with us\u201d (in the words of an academic from the English department, who\nasked to remain anonymous because they are at risk of redundancy). Many\nunderstand very well the financial pressures Goldsmiths is under, although\nthey point out that they\u2019ve already made many concessions to save money.\n\u201cVoluntary redundancy schemes, vacancy rates and cutting down associate\nlecturer budgets and research budgets: with that, Goldsmiths had already\nrecouped \u00a310.1m. We didn\u2019t really oppose any of that, because it was\nacknowledged there was a need,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez Vel\u00e1zquez says.\n\nBut to make cuts like this, which are planned for this September, will surely\nchange the face of the university, diminishing the educational offer that many\nstudents \u2013 certainly many undergraduates \u2013 signed up for, and curtailing much\nof the activity for which Goldsmiths is famous.\n\nApart from the fact Blur met there, Goldsmiths is known for a few things. It\u2019s\nquite an anarchic, radical place. English students go there for the\ndecolonisation, and students of sociology and art go there for the ecology\ncourse. Des Freedman, professor of media and communications (not at risk from\nthe redundancy plans), summarises it more broadly as: \u201cIt specialises in the\ncreative and the critical, so you would expect more musicians, more artists,\nmore film-makers, more designers than in less specialist institutions, all of\nthose with a critical perspective.\u201d It has punched above its weight \u2013 being a\nsmall university of about 8,600 students, with a turnover of \u00a3135m versus a\nuniversity average of \u00a3250m \u2013 both in terms of reputation and international\npull. Since about a third of its students are international, more as\npostgraduates than undergrads, and since, as is well known, the fees foreign\nstudents pay go so very far towards keeping any tertiary education institution\nafloat, to strip out the unique elements that bring them here seems, in the\nfirst place, bizarre.\n\nCorner is adamant: \u201cOur financial position is really serious. We absolutely\nknow what we\u2019ve got to do. [These redundancies] sound like a lot, but part of\nthe problem is that over the last five years we\u2019ve lost a thousand students.\nIn terms of the amount of money our staff bring in, only the London School of\nTropical Medicine is lower than us. The number of students per member of staff\nis very low, and it\u2019s not sustainable.\u201d\n\nWithout question, some of this situation is unique to Goldsmiths and the\ndecisions of Corner and her senior management team. The administrative staff\nwere streamlined in the so-called recovery plan into one central hub in\n2021-22, again to save money, and there has been chaos ever since. The details\nare quite funny, like watching W1A, but only if you are doing so from a\ngigantic distance. One of the reasons for the decline in international student\nrecruitment was that \u201cthe letters went out too late\u201d, says Hern\u00e1ndez\nVel\u00e1zquez. \u201cThe prospective students couldn\u2019t get their visas. They can\u2019t deny\nthat, but what has been very frustrating is that they have never explained how\nmany letters didn\u2019t get sent. We were never told what the shortfall was. We\nwere just told that people don\u2019t want to come here any more.\u201d\n\nThat is thought to have cost hundreds of international applications, though\nCorner rejects that, blaming \u201cproblems within departments\u201d, along with\nspurious applications and a tightening of Home Office regulations,\nparticularly recently around dependency visas for postgrads. That anti-\nimmigrant sabre-rattling by the government has fallen harder on some\nuniversities than others. Chinese postgrads, for example, tend not to bring\ndependants, while Nigerians on average bring two and a half.\n\n> Enter the performative xenophobia of the new Conservative. Foreign students\n> used to be an export success story\n\nYet in many ways, what\u2019s happening at Goldsmiths is a vivid thumbnail sketch\nof the crises, both accidental and deliberately manufactured, hitting the\nentire sector, bar a very few stunningly well-funded universities from the\nhigh-profile Russell Group.\n\nSpecific to the so-called \u201cclassroom\u201d subjects of the humanities \u2013 English,\nhistory, sociology \u2013 the financial model is falling apart. Would it amaze you\nto hear that the Tories and Lib Dems of 2010 did not think this through? When\ntuition fees were first hiked to nine grand a year by the coalition\ngovernment, Andrew McGettigan, author of the Great University Gamble and\nexpert in university funding and finance, says: \u201cSuddenly classroom subjects\nwere getting a lot more than the cost of delivering teaching, so you could\nfund research time in your department out of the money you were getting from\nyour students.\u201d You could also cross-subsidise more expensive subjects.\n\nThis led to what he calls \u201ca great sucking sound\u201d as larger, more prestigious\ninstitutions pulled in humanities students because they were very lucrative.\nThis became even more pronounced when George Osborne abolished the cap on\nstudent numbers in the 2013 autumn budget. This led to a slow death spiral for\nsmaller universities; their prestige came from being research universities,\nrather than just teaching universities, but they were having to drop their\ngrade requirements to keep their numbers up. Prestige takes quite a long time\nto drain away, though (longer to rebuild, of course), so the situation bobbed\nalong for a bit with a lot of research staff in the humanities who were\nbasically paid for by undergraduates they didn\u2019t teach.\n\nBut there was a much bigger problem coming: as tuition fees have stagnated,\ngoing up only by \u00a3250 in 14 years, even classroom subjects are now costing\nmore than they bring in. So the only possible cross-subsidy is from foreign\nstudents, whose fees are unregulated and have no ceiling \u2013 some undergraduate\ncourses at Oxford are \u00a348,000 a year for overseas students. Oxbridge has more\nmoney than it knows what to do with, while smaller institutions just get by.\nBut now enter \u2013 let\u2019s call it, for brevity \u2013 the performative xenophobia of\nthe new Conservative. Foreign students, considered until so recently an export\nsuccess story (not just their fees but every meal deal they bought counted as\na plus on the UK\u2019s balance of payments), are now a number that Tory ministers\nvie with one another to reduce.\n\nSo when Corner blames the government (in tactful, passive terms: \u201cThat\u2019s why\narts and humanities have been undermined\u201d), that is fair. When academics and\nstudents say they suspect her of trying to turn Goldsmiths into a \u201cmanagement\nand business teaching university\u201d, as Peacock describes it, supplying\ntechnical and vocational education to students who pay through the nose and\ndefinitely don\u2019t occupy lecture theatres, she would deny that in general\nterms: \u201cI would say that that thing that makes Goldsmiths really special is\nthe combination of humanities and social sciences.\u201d But her core argument is\nthat the sector is underfunded and the funding model is bust anyway, and she\u2019s\nnot wrong.\n\n> Arts, humanities and social sciences are seen as easy targets by tabloids,\n> by GB News. But this is a huge asset to the economy\n\nProf Des Freedman\n\nMore sinister is the sense that Freedman describes: \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to think\nthat a culture war is being evoked against you simply for trying to think\nindependently and critically.\u201d Science minister Michelle Donelan\u2019s recent\nshameful attack on two academics, reporting them to UKRI (the national\nresearch-funding body) for extremism and blighting their lives over an\naccusation that was wholly without foundation, springs to mind \u2013 but then so\ndoes almost everything Donelan and education secretary Gillian Keegan say\nabout the sector in general, and humanities in particular. All those\nreferences to \u201cwoke ideology\u201d, \u201cintolerant woke bullies\u201d and \u201ccancel culture\u201d\nare increasingly accompanied by defunding of the humanities, using increased\naccessibility to education as a fig leaf, as Keegan announced last week.\n\n\u201cYour subjects are mocked and called low value,\u201d Freedman says. \u201cArts,\nhumanities and social sciences haven\u2019t played the instrumentalist game, so\nthey\u2019re seen as easy targets by tabloids, by GB News. We would laugh it off,\nbut this is a huge asset to the British economy.\u201d More importantly, he\ncontinues, \u201cit\u2019s not just a tragedy \u2013 it\u2019s almost like a crime to shrink those\nspaces that provide a home for the inquisitive, the experimental. If the space\ndisappears, it\u2019s very hard to recreate it.\u201d\n\nStudent campaigners took control of Deptford town hall on the Goldsmiths\ncampus in 2019. Photograph: Anna Gordon/The Guardian\n\nMcGettigan perceives expedience here: universities are very independent,\ninstitutionally, and that\u2019s a problem when the market starts to fail (and it\nis failing: a truly tragic sidebar is that it\u2019s not working out for students\neither, and some universities are hitting 30% dropout rates after the first\nyear. Maintenance grants haven\u2019t kept pace with inflation, and students just\ncan\u2019t afford to stay). \u201cCulture wars do distract from market failure,\u201d he\nsays, \u201cand leave the impression that the market failure was a result of\nmisplaced priorities.\u201d\n\nAll that would definitely be bad \u2013 cynical, self-sabotaging, philistine. But\nthere\u2019s another possibility that is worse: that culture wars aren\u2019t being\nfought to destroy the humanities \u2013 rather that humanities are being destroyed\nbecause they\u2019re incredibly inconvenient to authoritarianism, representing as\nthey do \u201ca pedagogical practice that calls students beyond themselves,\nembraces the ethical imperative for them to care for others, embrace\nhistorical memory, work to dismantle structures of domination, and to become\nsubjects rather than objects of history, politics, and power\u201d.\n\nThat\u2019s from Critical Pedagogy in the Age of Fascist Politics by the American\nacademic Henry Giroux, and I mention it not to freak anyone out, merely to\nnote how striking the similarities are between rhetorical and financial\nattacks on the arts and humanities in the US and in the UK. You can read about\nthe crisis in the creative writing degree at the University of Florida and\nswap out only one or two words (\u201csemester\u201d, plus the name of the president)\nand you could be reading about Goldsmiths.\n\n\u2018Cultural and social vandalism\u2019: job cut plans at Goldsmiths attacked\n\nRead more\n\nIn fact, the students protesting about Gaza at Goldsmiths are also\npassionately opposed to the mass redundancies, and many of the staff were\ninvolved, non-residentially, with the occupation \u2013 teach-ins, coming to guest\nlectures, supportive vibes. But there\u2019s a deeper connective logic, common to\nstudent protest throughout history. MacRae, when the occupation began, was\nworking on a soundscape about the Tiananmen Square massacre, where her father\nhad witnessed the occupation of the square and subsequent shootings of\nstudents and civilians. \u201cDid they get what they wanted?\u201d she says. \u201cOf course\nnot. But for a few months, the whole city was in a state of anarchy in a\nbeautiful way, and people still remember that feeling.\u201d\n\nWhen you embark on an education that cannot obviously be commodified, that\ndoesn\u2019t translate into earnings, it is a way of saying (and believing) that\nyour mind\u2019s value to society is innate. Politics is your business because you\nare its business. You are the keeper of ideas, historical memory, compassion,\ncontext, hope, that the market cannot understand and authoritarianism cannot\nstomach.\n\nBack in February, one (anonymous) academic was in a meeting at which some of\nthe senior management team wanted to get the students arrested. \u201cCan you\nimagine?\u201d they said. \u201cCalling the police on your own students? At Goldsmiths?\u201d\nThat was outvoted, but the ludicrousness hangs in the air.\n\nCan you imagine? Trying to hollow out the arts and humanities? In the UK,\nwhere it\u2019s one of the few things we\u2019re good at? (No offence, scientists:\nyou\u2019re good too.) You don\u2019t have to imagine it \u2013 you can see it. But I don\u2019t\nthink it\u2019s a done deal.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Goldsmiths, University of London\n  * University funding\n  * Universities\n  * Higher education\n  * Teaching\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Education\n  * Schools\n  * Teachers\n  * Universities\n  * Students\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
