The first famous person\nto be imprisoned in the island by the order of emperor Nikephoros I was Plato\nof Sakkoudion, the uncle of renowned cleric Theodoros Stoudites, for\nsupporting his nephew in his conflict with the emperor. Other famous people\nwho stayed in the island for religious and political reasons were Gebon, Basil\nSkleros, Nikephoritzes (the chief minister of Michael VII Doukas), Patriarch\nJohn of Antioch and Patriarch Michael II of Constantinople. The graves of\nthose who died on the island during the Byzantine period can still be seen\ntoday.^[1]\n\nThe ruins of a Roman settlement and a 9th-century Byzantine monastery can\nstill be seen on the shore, close to the fishermen's shelter, a small wharf\nwhich is often used by yachts. The most important buildings on the island were\nbuilt in the 9th century AD, including a church, a chapel dedicated to\nreligious martyrs, a monastery on the eastern end (with its walls still seen\ntoday) and a cistern in the center of the island (a part of which can still be\nseen).\n\nIn 1911, in an event called \"Hay\u0131rs\u0131zada Dog Massacre\", the Governor of\nIstanbul ordered the stray dogs in the streets to be rounded up and exiled to\nSivriada. About 80,000 dogs were killed during the ordeal, mostly due to\nhunger and thirst on the barren land of the island, and some due to drowning\nas they tried to escape the horrible conditions of the island. A severe\nearthquake which immediately followed the event was perceived by the local as\n\"a punishment by God for abandoning the dogs.\" That is why the island is known\nboth as Sivriada and Hay\u0131rs\u0131zada (\"the inauspicious island\").^[2]^[3]^[4]^[5]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"Sivriada\".
