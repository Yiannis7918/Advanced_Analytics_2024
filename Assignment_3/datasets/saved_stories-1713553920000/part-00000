The 2024 Index is our\nmost comprehensive to date and arrives at an important moment when AI\u2019s\ninfluence on society has never been more pronounced. This year, we have\nbroadened our scope to more extensively cover essential trends such as\ntechnical advancements in AI, public perceptions of the technology, and the\ngeopolitical dynamics surrounding its development. Featuring more original\ndata than ever before, this edition introduces new estimates on AI training\ncosts, detailed analyses of the responsible AI landscape, and an entirely new\nchapter dedicated to AI\u2019s impact on science and medicine.\n\nRead the 2024 AI Index Report\n\n## Mission\n\nThe AI Index report tracks, collates, distills, and visualizes data related to\nartificial intelligence (AI). Our mission is to provide unbiased, rigorously\nvetted, broadly sourced data in order for policymakers, researchers,\nexecutives, journalists, and the general public to develop a more thorough and\nnuanced understanding of the complex field of AI.\n\nThe AI Index is recognized globally as one of the most credible and\nauthoritative sources for data and insights on artificial intelligence.\nPrevious editions have been cited in major newspapers, including the The New\nYork Times, Bloomberg, and The Guardian, have amassed hundreds of academic\ncitations, and been referenced by high-level policymakers in the United\nStates, the United Kingdom, and the European Union, among other places. This\nyear\u2019s edition surpasses all previous ones in size, scale, and scope,\nreflecting the growing significance that AI is coming to hold in all of our\nlives.\n\n## Steering Committee Co-Directors\n\n### Jack Clark\n\n### Ray Perrault\n\n## Steering Committee Members\n\n### Erik Brynjolfsson\n\n### John Etchemendy\n\n### Katrina Ligett\n\n### Terah Lyons\n\n### James Manyika\n\n### Juan Carlos Niebles\n\n### Vanessa Parli\n\n### Yoav Shoham\n\n### Russell Wald\n\n## Staff Members\n\n### Loredana Fattorini\n\n### Nestor Maslej\n\n## Letter from the Co-Directors\n\nA decade ago, the best AI systems in the world were unable to classify objects\nin images at a human level. AI struggled with language comprehension and could\nnot solve math problems. Today, AI systems routinely exceed human performance\non standard benchmarks.\n\nProgress accelerated in 2023. New state-of-the-art systems like GPT-4, Gemini,\nand Claude 3 are impressively multimodal: They can generate fluent text in\ndozens of languages, process audio, and even explain memes. As AI has\nimproved, it has increasingly forced its way into our lives. Companies are\nracing to build AI-based products, and AI is increasingly being used by the\ngeneral public. But current AI technology still has significant problems. It\ncannot reliably deal with facts, perform complex reasoning, or explain its\nconclusions.\n\nAI faces two interrelated futures. First, technology continues to improve and\nis increasingly used, having major consequences for productivity and\nemployment. It can be put to both good and bad uses. In the second future, the\nadoption of AI is constrained by the limitations of the technology. Regardless\nof which future unfolds, governments are increasingly concerned. They are\nstepping in to encourage the upside, such as funding university R&D and\nincentivizing private investment. Governments are also aiming to manage the\npotential downsides, such as impacts on employment, privacy concerns,\nmisinformation, and intellectual property rights.\n\nAs AI rapidly evolves, the AI Index aims to help the AI community,\npolicymakers, business leaders, journalists, and the general public navigate\nthis complex landscape. It provides ongoing, objective snapshots tracking\nseveral key areas: technical progress in AI capabilities, the community and\ninvestments driving AI development and deployment, public opinion on current\nand potential future impacts, and policy measures taken to stimulate AI\ninnovation while managing its risks and challenges. By comprehensively\nmonitoring the AI ecosystem, the Index serves as an important resource for\nunderstanding this transformative technological force.\n\nOn the technical front, this year\u2019s AI Index reports that the number of new\nlarge language models released worldwide in 2023 doubled over the previous\nyear. Two-thirds were open-source, but the highest-performing models came from\nindustry players with closed systems. Gemini Ultra became the first LLM to\nreach human-level performance on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding\n(MMLU) benchmark; performance on the benchmark has improved by 15 percentage\npoints since last year. Additionally, GPT-4 achieved an impressive 0.97 mean\nwin rate score on the comprehensive Holistic Evaluation of Language Models\n(HELM) benchmark, which includes MMLU among other evaluations.\n\nAlthough global private investment in AI decreased for the second consecutive\nyear, investment in generative AI skyrocketed. More Fortune 500 earnings calls\nmentioned AI than ever before, and new studies show that AI tangibly boosts\nworker productivity. On the policymaking front, global mentions of AI in\nlegislative proceedings have never been higher. U.S. regulators passed more\nAI-related regulations in 2023 than ever before. Still, many expressed\nconcerns about AI\u2019s ability to generate deepfakes and impact elections. The\npublic became more aware of AI, and studies suggest that they responded with\nnervousness.\n\nRay Perrault Co-director, AI Index\n\n## Our Supporting Partners\n\n## Analytics & Research Partners\n\n## Learn More\n\nStay up to date on the AI Index by subscribing to the Stanford HAI newsletter.\n\n## Follow us\n\nhttps://twitter.com/StanfordHAI https://www.facebook.com/StanfordHAI\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UChugFTK0KyrES9terTid8vA\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/stanfordhai\nhttps://www.instagram.com/stanfordhai\n\n### Newsletter Sign Up\n\nDon\u2019t miss out.
