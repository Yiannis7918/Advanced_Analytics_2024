That's up about 48% from 84 launch and re-entry events in 2022,\nand 106% from 60 in 2021.\n\nThe agency in February called for a 36% increase in the budget of its\ncommercial space office.\n\n\"We've seen increased demand for our services over the last few years,\" Kelvin\nColeman, FAA associate administrator for commercial space transportation, said\non a media roundtable in February, per spacenews.com.\n\n\"Right now we're at about 140 people and they're all pedaling as fast as they\ncan,\" said Coleman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpaceX dominates the US commercial space sector, accounting for almost half of\nall licensed launches in the US between 1989 and August 2023, per the FAA.\n\nThe company has already launched more than 30 rockets in 2024, having broken\nits own record by launching 96 rockets in 2023.\n\nStill, commercial partners say Biden's move could be premature. Many space\nexploration firms are in a fragile early state where they are struggling to\nbreak even, and spaceflight takes up a small amount of time in the airspace \u2014\nabout 15 seconds per flight \u2014 compared to sectors handled by the FAA, per The\nTimes.\n\nTaxing the industry is \"not appropriate at this time,\" said Karina Drees,\npresident of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, per The Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiden's call comes as part of an overhaul of the aviation excise tax\nstructure, fueled in part by an independent safety review report published by\nthe FAA last year, according to The Times.\n\nThe US President last month also called for private and corporate jet owners\nto increase their contributions, as part of his push for the wealthy and big\ncorporations to pay \"their fair share.\"\n\nHis proposal would increase the tax on fuel to $1.06 per gallon over five\nyears, up from 21.8 cents, per The Times.\n\nSpaceX and Blue Origin did not immediately reply to a request for comment\n\nRead next\n\n### Watch: While Delta's business is 'extremely robust,' the airline's\nmarketing chief stays focused on the data\n\nSpaceX Biden\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecommended video\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollow us on:\n\n  * * Copyright \u00a9 2024 Insider Inc.
