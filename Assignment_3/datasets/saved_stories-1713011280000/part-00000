The stamps were\nnamed as such so one knew they could use the stamp \"forever,\" regardless of\nwhen it was purchased.\n\nThe latest proposed changes \u2014 to be reviewed and approved by the governors of\nthe Postal Service \u2014 also include a nickel hike to the price to mail a 1-ounce\nmetered letter, to 69 cents, the postal service said Tuesday in a news\nrelease.\n\nMailing a postcard domestically will run you 56 cents, a 3-cent increase,\nwhile the price of mailing postcards and letters internationally are both\nrising by a dime to $1.65.\n\nAll told, the proposed changes represent a roughly 7.8% increase in the price\nof sending mail through the agency.\n\nNotably, the price of renting a Post Office Box is not going up, and USPS will\nreduce the cost of postal insurance 10% when mailing an item, it said.\n\nThe cost of Forever stamps rose to 68 cents in January, from 66 cents.\n\nThe increases, part of the Postal Service's 10-year plan toward profitability,\nare hurting mail volume and USPS' bottom line, according to Keep US Posted, a\nnonprofit advocacy group of consumers, nonprofits, newspapers, greeting card\npublishers, magazines and catalogs.\n\nThe group called for the proposed increases to be rejected and for Congress to\ntake a closer look at the Postal Service's operations, citing findings by NDP\nAnalytics in March.\n\n\"If rate increases continue to proceed at this frequency and magnitude without\ncritical review, it risks plummeting volume further and exacerbating USPS's\nfinancial challenges,\" according to the report commissioned by the Greeting\nCard Association and Association for Postal Commerce.\n\nUSPS in November reported a $6.5 billion loss for fiscal 2023, and is\nprojecting a $6.3 billion deficit in 2024.\n\n### More from CBS News\n\nInflation runs hot for a third straight month, led by by gas and rent\n\nWhy you should open a high-yield savings account with inflation increasing\nagain\n\nInflation is sticking around.
