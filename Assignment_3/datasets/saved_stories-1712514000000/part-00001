He freely\nadmits that the Hakko is probably better, but he wonders if it\u2019s good enough\nto justify being four times as expensive. He shows both of them off in a\nrecent video that you can see below.\n\nOften, desoldering doesn\u2019t get as much attention as soldering, but for repairs\nor if you make mistakes \u2014 and who doesn\u2019t \u2014 it is an essential skill. Many of\nthe differences will be either good or bad, depending on your personal\npreference. For example, the Hakko is an all-in-one unit, so it doesn\u2019t have a\nbulky box to sit on your bench. However, that also means the Hakko is larger\nand heavier. It also lacks controls and indicators the other unit has on the\nbase station box.\n\nWhat doesn\u2019t come down to personal preference, though, is usability. The Hakko\nseems much easier to clean and if you\u2019ve ever used a gun like this, you know\nhow often you do have to clean it. If you ever forget to ream the nozzle out\nregularly during use, you probably won\u2019t forget a second time because\nunclogging any of these guns can be a nightmare. We like to use a long, stiff\nwire to push through the barrel frequently when using a tool like this to\nprevent having to clear it like [Lee] did at the eleven-minute mark.\n\n[Lee] mentions that the Hakko also has more suction and sustains it better.\nThat seems like a clear win. We\u2019ve had expensive guns and cheap ones, and if\nthey don\u2019t suck well or long, you are as well off with a spring-loaded solder\npuller. In fact, for our money, buying a high-quality hand unit is probably a\nbetter deal for most people. It is hard for the pumps to equal the amount of\npull you get from a spring.\n\nNozzle changing is another area where the Hakko shines. Our impression is that\nthe Hakko is clearly better when it comes to creature comforts. However, the\nreal question is how they desolder. The end of the video shows a face-off, and\nwhile the Hakko does seem superior, the cheap gun certainly got the job done.\n[Lee] mentions it may come down to volume. If you desolder constantly, you\nwill likely be happier with the Hakko. However, the cheap gun would be fine\nfor occasional use. Or save your money and invest in a good spring-loaded\nsucker.\n\nOf course, everyone has their own favorites. We\u2019ve seen custom soldering iron\ntips that heat whole areas efficiently if you don\u2019t want to use something like\nChip Quik. We are always surprised we don\u2019t see more desoldering needles.\nMeanwhile, if you want to examine all your options, ask [Bil Herd] how he does\nit.\n\nPosted in Tool HacksTagged desoldering station\n\n### Leave a ReplyCancel reply\n\nPlease be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.\n(Comment Policy)\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
