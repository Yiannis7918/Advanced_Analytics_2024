But it\u2019s hard to talk about. If I say\nyou got lucky, I look jealous. If I tell myself that I got lucky, I feel\ndiminished.\n\nMaybe a better way to frame luck is by asking: what isn\u2019t repeatable?\n\nLucky implies random events you could not see coming. What isn\u2019t repeatable is\ndifferent. Did Jeff Bezos get lucky creating Amazon? Not in the same way a\nlottery winner is lucky, of course. He was visionary and ambitious and savvy\nto a degree you only see a few times per century.\n\nBut could he, starting today, without any money or name recognition, create a\nnew multi-trillion dollar business from scratch?\n\nMaybe, but probably not. There are so many things that helped Amazon become\nwhat it is that can\u2019t be replicated \u2013 growth of the internet, market\nconditions, old competitors, politics, regulations, etc. Bezos is enormously\nskilled in a way that is not luck. But a lot of what he did was not\nrepeatable. Those points are not contradictory.\n\nIt\u2019s so important to know the difference between the two when attempting to\nlearn from someone. You want to try to emulate skills that are repeatable.\nAttempting to copy the parts of someone\u2019s success that aren\u2019t repeatable is\nequivalent to a 56-year-old dressing like a teenager and expecting to be cool.\n\nThere\u2019s a law in evolution called Dollo\u2019s Law of Irreversibility that says\nonce a species loses a trait, it will never gain that trait back because the\npath that gave it the trait in the first place was so complicated that it\ncan\u2019t be replicated. Say an animal has horns, and then it evolves to lose its\nhorns. The odds that it will ever evolve to regain its horns are nil, because\nthe path that originally gave it horns was so complex \u2013 millions of years of\nselection under specific environmental and competitive conditions that won\u2019t\nrepeat in the future. You can\u2019t call evolutionary traits luck \u2013 they came\nabout because of very specific forces. You just can\u2019t ever rely on those\nforces repeating themselves exactly as they did in the past.\n\nA lot of things work like that.\n\nIn business and investing, you want to learn the big lessons about why things\nbehave the way they do without assuming the past is a direct guide to the\nfuture, because it\u2019s not \u2013 most of the details are not repeatable. History is\nthe study of change, ironically used as a map of the future.\n\nJason Zweig of the Wall Street Journal once talked about what happens when you\ntry to learn a very specific, non-repeatable lesson when a broader, very\nrepeatable lesson is what you needed to pay attention to:\n\n> [After the dot-com crash], the lesson people learned from that was not, \u201cI\n> should never speculate on overvalued financial assets.\u201d The lesson they\n> learned was, \u201cI should never speculate on internet stocks.\u201d And so the same\n> people who lost 90% or more of their money day-trading internet stocks ended\n> up flipping homes in the mid 2000s, and getting wiped out doing that. It\u2019s\n> dangerous to learn narrow lessons.\n\nThe great thing when you ask, \u201cis this repeatable?\u201d is that you start to focus\non things that you and I \u2013 ordinary lay people \u2013 have a chance of repeating\nourselves.\n\nYou can learn a lot from Warren Buffett\u2019s patience. But you can\u2019t replicate\nthe market environment he had in the 1950s, so be careful copying the specific\nstrategies he used back then.\n\nYou can learn so much from John D. Rockefeller about the importance of\ncontrolling distribution. But you cannot replicate the 20th century legal\nsystem that allowed him to destroy competitors, so don\u2019t get carried away\nthere.\n\nElon Musk can teach you a lot about risk-taking and branding, but much less\nabout competing in the auto business.\n\nJeff Bezos can teach you so much about management and long-term thinking, but\nmuch less about e-commerce and cloud computing.\n\nThe way to get luckier is to find what\u2019s repeatable.\n\nSHARE\n\n  * Copy Link\n\n### Sign up for more Collab Fund content\n\n## More from the blog...\n\n### Smart Words From Smart People\n\nby Morgan Housel \u2014 Mar 24, 2024\n\nA few smart things I\u2019ve read recently...\n\n### The Dumber Side of Smart People\n\nby Morgan Housel \u2014 Mar 3, 2024\n\nMost people will die after three days without water.\n\n### A Few Thoughts on Spending Money\n\nby Morgan Housel \u2014 Jan 31, 2024\n\nThere are two ways to use money.\n\n# Collab Fund\n\nCollaborative is a leading source of capital for big ideas pushing the world\nforward.\n\n## Newsletter\n\nSign up for updates \u2197\n\n## Twitter\n\nFollow @collabfund \u2197\n\n## RSS\n\nSubscribe to the blog \u2197\n\nCollaborative Fund Management LLC, Collaborative Holdings Management LP and\nCollab+Currency Management, LLC are distinct investment advisory entities, are\nnot a unitary enterprise and operate independently of one another.
