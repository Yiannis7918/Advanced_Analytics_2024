It\u2019s\nalso aging and under increasing stress from climate-driven disasters such as\nwildfires, hurricanes and heat waves.\n\nOver the past decade, power grids have played roles in wildfires in multiple\nstates, including California, Hawaii, Oregon and Minnesota. When wind speeds\nare high and humidity is low, electrical infrastructure such as aboveground\npower lines can blow into vegetation or spark against other components,\nstarting a fire that high winds then spread.\n\nUnder extreme conditions, utilities may opt to shut off power to parts of the\ngrid in their service areas to reduce wildfire risk. These outages, known as\npublic safety power shutoffs, have occurred mainly in California, where\nwildfires have become larger and more destructive in recent decades.\n\nOn April 5-6, 2024, Colorado utility Xcel Energy carried out that state\u2019s\nfirst public safety power shutoff, cutting power to thousands of customers\nahead of an intense windstorm. Public officials and Xcel customers complained\nthat they had not received enough warning or explanation. Gov. Jared Polis has\ndirected state regulators to investigate the incident and propose better\nprocedures for the future.\n\nColoradans describe how they were affected by the April outages.\n\nI am an electrical and computer engineer, and study efficient operation of\npower grids. I also live in Boulder County, where a wind-driven wildfire\ndestroyed more than 1,000 homes in 2021. These shutoffs are likely to become\nmore common in more places as climate-driven weather extremes stress aging\ngrid components. This makes it important to understand and evaluate utilities\u2019\npublic safety shutoff plans.\n\n## An intricate system\n\nShutting off power and turning it back on \u2013 in utility-speak, de-energizing\nand re-energizing \u2013 requires more than flipping a switch. The power grid is a\ncomplex system that maintains a balance in real time between electricity\nflowing in from generating plants and out to customers.\n\nPower lines don\u2019t have the capacity to store electricity for use later \u2013 it\nhas to be used immediately. This makes the grid different from other critical\ninfrastructure. Water networks can hold water in their pipes, and roadways can\nsupport cars at a standstill if traffic can\u2019t flow.\n\nBecause the grid can\u2019t store electricity, de-energizing and re-energizing have\nto happen in stages to ensure that changes in the demand side of the power\ngrid are not too rapid for the supply side to adapt to. Power plants can\u2019t\nturn on instantaneously: Some can start up within minutes, while others take\nhours, depending on their age, design and the type of fuel they use. And they\ngenerally can\u2019t raise their output from 10% of their generating capacity to\n90% with the flick of a switch.\n\nWhen a utility restores power after an outage, it produces a large,\ninstantaneous spike in power use as devices in many homes turn back on. The\ngrid also needs time to adapt to that surge in demand. And utilities may\nvisually inspect power lines to check for damage before restoring power.\n\nThe complexities of local grids can make it seem as though these outages are\nbeing implemented unevenly or arbitrarily. The distribution transformer\nserving power to your home may be completely electrically disconnected from\nthe one serving your neighbor across the street, putting your block in the\ndark while the next block\u2019s lights stay on.\n\nAnd a utility may cut power because of a risk somewhere in its network that\ncustomers can\u2019t see. It\u2019s not always possible for utilities to fine-tune areas\nwhere power shutoffs happen.\n\nAerial view of homes destroyed by the 2018 Camp Fire in Paradise, Calif. The\nfire, which killed 85 people, was blamed on inadequate equipment inspection\nand maintenance by PG&E, one of the state\u2019s largest utilities.

The\nstate\u2019s public utility commission approved them in 2012 as a way to mitigate\nthe potential impacts of utility equipment-induced wildfires, and it has\nissued regulations guiding when utilities can de-energize power lines. The\nregulations require power companies to notify customers in advance and submit\ndetailed reports within 10 days after each planned blackout.\n\nMillions of Californians have experienced these shutdowns over the past\ndecade. A 2023 review by PSE Healthy Energy, an independent research\ninstitute, found that the most-affected counties, mainly in Southern\nCalifornia, average four to five public safety outages yearly, which on\naverage last 48 hours.\n\nOregon has followed suit, adopting public safety shutdown rules in 2022, but\nmany other jurisdictions do not yet have formal protocols in place. Instead,\nthese critical decisions rest with utilities. Developing sophisticated plans\nfor public safety outages requires extensive knowledge of a utility\u2019s\nterritory and accurate assessments of which zones are high-risk areas.\n\nUtilities, however, don\u2019t always have abundant sensors in low-voltage\ndistribution grids \u2013 the portion of the system that brings power into\nneighborhoods \u2013 and may lack extremely granular control over individual\ncomponents. In fact, unplanned outages often must be manually reported. Many\nutilities are installing smart meters, some of which can automatically report\noutages back to the utility.\n\nPower providers are also taking other steps to strengthen their grids against\ndisasters, such as burying power lines. But depending on the location, this\nstrategy can easily cost up to US$1 million per mile for low-voltage\ndistribution grids and millions of dollars per mile for high-voltage\ntransmission lines. These projects require intricate cost-benefit\ncalculations, and their costs ultimately will trickle down to electricity\nconsumers.\n\nThis Southern California Edison video explains how the utility determines\nwhether a public safety power outage is required and how it manages these\nactions.\n\n## Preparing for public safety power shutdowns\n\nFor some people, losing power is a minor inconvenience. For others, it can\nmean the difference between life or death if they need electricity to keep\nessential medicine refrigerated, charge a portable oxygen concentrator or\nmaintain their home temperature within a safe range.\n\nUtilities should keep in contact with customers during every step of a public\nsafety shutoff, starting with alerting them to charge essential devices and\ntake other preparatory steps. They also should move people who have medical\nconditions or other issues that require access to power out of the blackout\nzone.\n\nTo make that kind of cooperation possible, utilities will need better insight\ninto the state of the distribution grid, more detailed models of their\nsystems, and improved measurement and sensing strategies that can help them\ndevelop accurate and granular assessments of wildfire risk.\n\nFinally, utilities will need to make their decisions more transparent. No one\nlikes losing power, so it is essential for ratepayers to understand why and\nhow these outages happen and what their utility is doing to provide power as\nsafely and reliably as possible.\n\n  * Electricity\n  * Colorado\n  * Regulation\n  * Natural disasters\n  * California\n  * Extreme weather\n  * Public safety\n  * Blackouts\n  * Electric utilities\n  * Wildfires\n  * Power outages\n\n### Events\n\nMore events\n\n### Jobs\n\n  * ##### Faculty of Law - Academic Appointment Opportunities\n\n  * ##### Operations Manager\n\n  * ##### Senior Education Technologist\n\n  * ##### Audience Development Coordinator (fixed-term maternity cover)\n\n  * ##### Lecturer (Hindi-Urdu)\n\nMore jobs\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2010\u20132024, The Conversation Media Group Ltd\n\n", "frontpage": true}
