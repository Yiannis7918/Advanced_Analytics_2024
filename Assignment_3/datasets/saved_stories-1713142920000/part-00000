The Board of\nCommissioners for the Port of Oakland voted to proceed with a plan to change\nthe airport\u2019s name to San Francisco Bay Oakland International Airport.\n\n(Justin Sullivan / Getty Images)\n\nBy Jireh DengStaff Writer\n\nApril 13, 2024 3 AM PT\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Show more sharing options\n\nShare\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Email\n  * Copy Link URLCopied!\n  * Print\n\nThe Port of Oakland Board of Commissioners unanimously voted this week to\nchange the name of Oakland International Airport to San Francisco Bay Oakland\nInternational Airport, infuriating San Francisco officials who promised to sue\nover the decision.\n\nThe name change will be finalized if approved in a second vote May 9.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very pleased with today\u2019s unanimous board approval, especially as a proud\nOaklander myself who wants to enhance economic activity and local jobs for\nOakland,\u201d Danny Wan, executive director of the Port of Oakland, said in a\nstatement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPort of Oakland officials say the change is necessary to sustain the airport\u2019s\n30,000 direct jobs and $1.6-billion economic impact in the region. Under the\nproposed rebranding, the airport code, OAK, will not be changed.\n\nThe move has angered San Francisco leaders, who say it will confuse travelers.\nBefore the vote, San Francisco City Atty. David Chiu wrote to the Port of\nOakland, promising to sue if the change was approved. The city of San\nFrancisco, he wrote, \u201chas strong legal claims ... for trademark infringement\nthat we intend to bring in court against the Port of Oakland.\u201d\n\nThe San Francisco airport, which has been operating since 1927, has been known\nby its moniker for almost the entirety of its existence, Chiu noted.\n\n\u201cThe names \u2018San Francisco Airport\u2019 and \u2018San Francisco International Airport\u2019\nare famous and highly recognizable among consumers in connection with the\nairport services that only SFO provides,\u201d Chiu wrote.\n\n\u201cWhile the proposed new name is very likely to cause confusion and mistakes\nbroadly, the problem will be particularly acute for an audience of\ninternational travelers who may not speak or read English,\u201d he added. \u201cThose\ninternational travelers comprise an essential part of SFO\u2019s consumer base.\u201d\n\nSan Francisco International Airport Director Ivar C. Satero said the airport\nwould support a lawsuit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSan Francisco Mayor London Breed asked Oakland officials to \u201cfollow a similar\nmodel to SFO\u201d and improve its airport services to increase revenue rather than\nchanging its name.\n\nKaley Skantz, a spokeswoman for Oakland International Airport, said attempts\nto expand services over the years have not been successful because of \u201cthe\nlack of geographic awareness among inbound travelers.\u201d\n\nShe pointed to a study by the Port of Oakland, which found that 30% of\ndomestic travelers did not realize how close the airport was to other Bay Area\ncities such as San Francisco, which is only 18 miles west by car.\n\n\u201cFlights to OAK haven\u2019t performed as well as they could,\u201d Skatnz said. Between\nJuly 2008 and March 2024, the airport attempted to add 54 new routes, she\nsaid, but 39 have been eliminated. In addition, six preexisting routes were\ncanceled because they did not have enough passengers.\n\nOakland officials hope the name change will boost recognition of the airport\u2019s\nlocation in the Bay Area. In 2016, Bob Hope Airport rebranded as Hollywood\nBurbank Airport and reported a subsequent 19% increase in flights during 2018\nto 2019, though it\u2019s not clear if the name change alone resulted in the\ngrowth.\n\nThe Port of Oakland began surveying residents of Oakland and the surrounding\nEast Bay area last fall, receiving results this month that showed general\nsupport for an airport rebrand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe rebrand would cost about $150,000, but the change would be self-funded by\nthe Port of Oakland without taxpayer dollars, port officials said.\n\nSouthwest and Spirit are two major airlines that have endorsed the change.\nJennifer Bridie, senior vice president of marketing for Southwest, voiced\nsupport for \u201ccontemporary naming\u201d that has \u201ca newfound regional draw and\ninstantly gains even more visibility among those around the world shopping for\nair travel to the Bay Area.\u201d\n\nMary Richardson, an attorney for the Port of Oakland, said officials are doing\nall they can to ensure clarity for prospective visitors to the Bay Area.\n\n\u201cSFO cannot lay claim to the geographically descriptive term \u2018San Francisco,\u2019\nlet alone claim exclusive rights to the San Francisco Bay,\u201d she said in a\nstatement.\n\n### More to Read\n\n  * ### This Bay Area airport wants to change its name.
