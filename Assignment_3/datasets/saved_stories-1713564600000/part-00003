From that group, five\nwere arrested in Sunnyvale and accused of trespassing, and four were arrested\nand charged with criminal trespassing in New York City.\n\nGoogle said in the memo the behavior violated multiple policies, including its\ncode of conduct and policy on harassment, discrimination, retaliation,\nstandards of conduct, and workplace concerns.\n\n\"They took over office spaces, defaced our property, and physically impeded\nthe work of other Googlers,\" Google said in the internal memo. \"Their behavior\nwas unacceptable, extremely disruptive, and made co-workers feel threatened.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to one of the arrested employees in New York City, 23-year-old Hasan\nIbraheem, the protest started around noon on Tuesday. The group of employees\nsat in the office and gave chants and speeches every 15 to 20 minutes until\nabout 6 p.m.\n\nThe group was asked to leave multiple times, but Ibraheem said at the time, he\nviewed the requests as \"empty threats.\" After losing access to the company's\nsystems and refusing to leave, the police arrested the remaining group at 9:30\np.m.\n\nRelated stories\n\nGoogle said it will continue to investigate and take action as needed.\n\n\"Behavior like this has no place in our workplace and we will not tolerate\nit,\" Google said in the memo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoogle added that it will continue to use its policies to take action against\ndisruptive behavior, which may include termination. The company also said\nemployees should expect to hear more from leaders about standards of behavior\nand discourse in the workplace.\n\nGoogle employees have generated headlines in the past for organizing protests,\nranging from walkouts protesting sexual misconduct at the company to petitions\nurging Google CEO Sundar Pichai to stop providing AI tech to US military\ndrones.\n\nMost recently, Google fired one employee for disrupting a presentation in New\nYork by the company's head of Google Israel.\n\nRead the full memo below:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGooglers,\n\nYou may have seen reports of protests at some of our offices yesterday.\nUnfortunately, a number of employees brought the event into our buildings in\nNew York and Sunnyvale. They took over office spaces, defaced our property,\nand physically impeded the work of other Googlers. Their behavior was\nunacceptable, extremely disruptive, and made co-workers feel threatened. We\nplaced employees involved under investigation and cut their access to our\nsystems. Those who refused to leave were arrested by law enforcement and\nremoved from our offices.\n\nFollowing investigation, today we terminated the employment of twenty-eight\nemployees found to be involved. We will continue to investigate and take\naction as needed.\n\nBehavior like this has no place in our workplace and we will not tolerate it.\nIt clearly violates multiple policies that all employees must adhere to \u2013\nincluding our Code of Conduct and Policy on Harassment, Discrimination,\nRetaliation, Standards of Conduct, and Workplace Concerns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe are a place of business and every Googler is expected to read our policies\nand apply them to how they conduct themselves and communicate in our\nworkplace. The overwhelming majority of our employees do the right thing. If\nyou're one of the few who are tempted to think we're going to overlook conduct\nthat violates our policies, think again. The company takes this extremely\nseriously, and we will continue to apply our longstanding policies to take\naction against disruptive behavior \u2013 up to and including termination.\n\nYou should expect to hear more from leaders about standards of behavior and\ndiscourse in the workplace.\n\nChris\n\nOn February 28, Axel Springer, Business Insider's parent company, joined 31\nother media groups and filed a $2.3 billion suit against Google in Dutch\ncourt, alleging losses suffered due to the company's advertising practices.\n\nRead next\n\n### Watch: Nearly 50,000 tech workers have been laid off \u2014 but there's a hack\nto avoid layoffs\n\nGoogle\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecommended video\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollow us on:\n\n  * * Copyright \u00a9 2024 Insider Inc.
