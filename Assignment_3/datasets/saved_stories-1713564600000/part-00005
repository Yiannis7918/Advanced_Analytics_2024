From late April through June 2024, the largest brood\nof 13-year cicadas, known as Brood XIX, will co-emerge with a midwestern brood\nof 17-year cicadas, Brood XIII.\n\nThis event will affect 17 states, from Maryland west to Iowa and south into\nArkansas, Alabama and northern Georgia, the Carolinas, Virginia and Maryland.\nA co-emergence like this of two specific broods with different life cycles\nhappens only once every 221 years. The last time these two groups emerged\ntogether was in 1803, when Thomas Jefferson was president.\n\nFor about four weeks, scattered wooded and suburban areas will ring with\ncicadas\u2019 distinctive whistling, buzzing and chirping mating calls. After\nmating, each female will lay hundreds of eggs in pencil-size tree branches.\nThen the adult cicadas will die. Once the eggs hatch, new cicada nymphs will\nfall from the trees and burrow back underground, starting the cycle again.\n\nThere are perhaps 3,000 to 5,000 species of cicadas around the world, but the\n13- and 17-year periodical cicadas of the eastern U.S. appear to be unique in\ncombining long juvenile development times underground with synchronized, mass\nadult emergences. There are two other known periodical cicadas in the world,\none in northeast India and one in Fiji, but these have only four-year and\neight-year life cycles, respectively.\n\nPeriodical cicadas raise many questions for entomologists and the public\nalike. What do cicadas do underground for 13 or 17 years? Why are their life\ncycles so long? Why are they synchronized? Will the two broods emerging this\nspring interact? How can citizen scientists help to document this emergence?\nAnd is climate change affecting this wonder of the insect world?\n\nWe study periodical cicadas to understand questions about biodiversity,\nbiogeography, behavior and ecology \u2013 the evolution, natural history and\ngeographic distribution of life. It\u2019s no accident that the scientific name for\nperiodical 13- and 17-year cicadas is Magicicada, shortened from \u201cmagic\ncicada.\u201d\n\nIllinois is expected to be ground zero for the dual emergence of two\nperiodical cicada broods in 2024.\n\n## Ancient visitors\n\nAs species, periodical cicadas are older than the forests that they inhabit.\nMolecular analysis has shown that about 4 million years ago, the ancestor of\nthe current Magicicada species split into two lineages. Some 1.5 million years\nlater, one of those lineages split again. The resulting three lineages are the\nbasis of the modern periodical cicada species groups, Decim, Cassini and\nDecula.\n\nEarly American colonists first encountered periodical cicadas in\nMassachusetts. The sudden appearance of so many insects reminded them of\nbiblical plagues of locusts, which are a type of grasshopper. That\u2019s how the\nname \u201clocust\u201d became incorrectly associated with cicadas in North America.\n\nDuring the 19th century, notable entomologists such as Benjamin Walsh, C.V.\nRiley and Charles Marlatt worked out the astonishing biology of periodical\ncicadas. They established that unlike locusts or other grasshoppers, cicadas\ndon\u2019t chew leaves, decimate crops or fly in swarms.\n\nInstead, these insects spend most of their lives out of sight, growing\nunderground and feeding on plant roots as they pass through five juvenile\nstages. Their synchronized emergences are predictable, occurring on a\nclockwork schedule of 17 years in the North and 13 years in the South and\nMississippi Valley. There are multiple, regional year classes, known as\nbroods.\n\nEach color on this map represents a brood of 13-year or 17-year cicadas,\ndenoted by University of Connecticut researchers observing active cicada\nchoruses.

This\nincreases their chances of accomplishing their key mission aboveground:\nfinding mates.\n\nDense emergences also provide what scientists call a predator-satiation or\nsafety-in-numbers defense. Any predator that feeds on cicadas, whether it\u2019s a\nfox, squirrel, bat or bird, will eat its fill long before it consumes all of\nthe insects in the area, leaving many survivors behind.\n\nWhile periodical cicadas largely come out on schedule every 17 or 13 years,\noften a small group emerges four years early or late. Early-emerging cicadas\nmay be faster-growing individuals that had access to abundant food, and the\nlaggards may be individuals that subsisted with less.\n\nIf growing conditions change over time, as is happening now with climate\nwarming, having the ability to make this kind of life cycle switch and come\nout either four years early in favorable times or four years late in more\ndifficult times becomes important. If a sudden warm or cold phase causes a\nlarge number of cicadas to come out off schedule by four years, the insects\ncan emerge in sufficient numbers to satiate predators and shift to a new\nschedule.\n\n## Will climate change shift Magicicada clocks?\n\nAs glaciers retreated from what is now the U.S. some 10,000 to 20,000 years\nago, periodical cicadas filled eastern forests. Temporary life cycle switching\nin diverse locations has formed a complex mosaic of broods.\n\nToday there are 12 broods of 17-year periodical cicadas in northeastern\ndeciduous forests, where trees drop leaves in winter. These groups are\nnumbered sequentially and fit together like a giant jigsaw puzzle. In the\nSoutheast and the Mississippi Valley there are three broods of 13-year\ncicadas.\n\nBecause periodical cicadas are sensitive to climate, the patterns of their\nbroods and species reflect climatic shifts. For example, genetic and other\ndata from our work indicate that the 13-year species Magicicada neotredecim,\nwhich is found in the upper Mississippi Valley, formed during a previous\ninterglacial period about 200,000 years ago.\n\nAs the environment warmed, 17-year cicadas in the area emerged successively,\ngeneration after generation, after 13 years underground. Eventually, they\npermanently shifted to a 13-year cycle.\n\nBut it\u2019s not clear whether cicadas can continue to evolve as quickly as humans\nare altering their environment. Although periodical cicadas prefer forest\nedges and thrive in suburban areas, they cannot survive deforestation or\nreproduce successfully in areas without trees.\n\nA pile of dead and dying periodical cicadas and their cast-off nymph shells\ncollect at the base of a tree in Columbia, Md., during the 2021 Brood X\nemergence. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nIndeed, some broods have already become extinct. In the late 19th century, one\nBrood (XXI) disappeared from north Florida and Georgia. Another (XI) has been\nextinct in northeast Connecticut since around 1954, and a third (VII) in\nupstate New York has shrunk from eight counties to one since mapping first\nbegan in the mid-1800s.\n\nClimate change could also have farther-reaching effects. As the U.S. climate\nwarms, longer growing seasons may provide a larger food supply. This may\neventually change more 17-year cicadas into 13-year cicadas, just as past\nwarming altered Magicicada neotredecim.\n\nEarly emergences occurred in 2017 in Cincinnati and the Baltimore-Washington\nmetro area, and in 1969, 2003 and 2020 in the Chicago metro area, with more\nindividuals participating in successive generations. We hypothesize that this\nwas due to climate warming.\n\nIn 2024, 17-year Brood XIII will emerge geographically adjacent to 13-year\nBrood XIX. However, contrary to some recent media reports, they will not\noverlap. We know this because we have mapped them in previous generations when\nthey emerged separately. In the area of adjacency, we are not able to tell the\ntwo broods apart. They are identical in appearance, song and genetics.\n\nResearchers need detailed high-quality information to track cicada\ndistributions over time. Citizen scientists are key to this effort because\nperiodical cicada populations are so large and their adult emergences last\nonly a few weeks.\n\nVolunteers who want to help document the 2024 emergence can download the\nCicada Safari mobile phone app, provide snapshots and follow our research in\nreal time online at www.cicadas.uconn.edu. Cicadas will be hard to ignore if\nthey\u2019re in your area, so why not learn to appreciate them and have fun?\n\nThis is an updated version of an article originally published on March 12,\n2021.\n\n  * Climate change\n  * Evolution\n  * Ecology\n  * Insects\n  * Trees\n  * Entomology\n  * Suburbs\n  * US Midwest\n  * Illinois\n  * Life cycles\n  * Cicadas\n\n### Events\n\nMore events\n\n### Jobs\n\n  * ##### Sydney Horizon Educators (Identified)\n\n  * ##### Senior Disability Services Advisor\n\n  * ##### Deputy Social Media Producer\n\n  * ##### Associate Professor, Occupational Therapy\n\n  * ##### GRAINS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION CHAIRPERSON\n\nMore jobs\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2010\u20132024, The Conversation Media Group Ltd\n\n", "frontpage": false}
