The service was rolled out for Android in\nOctober 2020, before coming to iOS devices and Macs in 2022.\n\nWhen it originally launched it was part of Google One's Premium 2TB storage\nplan, priced at $9.99 per month or $99.99 per year. Last year, availability\nwas expanded to all Google One plans, including the cheapest offering for\n$1.99 per month, making it significantly more affordable.\n\nThe company told 9to5Google that it is killing the service because \"people\nsimply weren't using it.\" Existing users will be directed to third-party VPN\nalternatives instead.\n\nGoogle will continue to offer VPN functionality through its Google Fi cellular\nservice. Google says Pixel users will also still be able to access its VPN\nfeatures via Pixel settings if they have a Pixel 7 or newer model.\n\nTags: Google, VPN\n\n[ 24 comments ]\n\n## Top Rated Comments\n\nhacky\n\n2 hours ago at 02:46 am\n\nMove on, yet another service killed by the Google\n('https://killedbygoogle.com/').\n\nScore: 16 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nApple Knowledge Navigator\n\n2 hours ago at 03:05 am\n\nI think everyone knew there was a particular irony with \u2018Google\u2019 and \u2018VPN\u2019 in\nthe same service...\n\nScore: 16 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nSamplasion\n\n2 hours ago at 02:48 am\n\nGoogle shuts down something?

Certainly across the Five Eyes I wouldn't be surprised if\nthey're illegal before the end of the decade.

I want everything to work as\nseamlessly as it does on iOS so naturally I choose Googles solutions. There\nisn\u2019t anything wrong with them and the cloud interface is good.\n\nBut you just never know what they will just randomly cut next. It started\nreally with the perfectly good Play Music app but the recent cull of their own\nPodcasts app (which I really liked) means I\u2019ll never go back now.\n\nApple doesn\u2019t normally drop apps and if they do it\u2019s for good reason. I used\nto devour content on iTunesU but it\u2019s a little redundant in the face of\nYouTube which has wider compatibility. The fact I can still use modern cloud\nfeatures on my 13 year old Mac Mini speaks volumes.\n\nScore: 3 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nRickDEGH\n\n2 hours ago at 03:15 am\n\n??? oh thou Google how hast my distrust in thee always been validated.\n\nScore: 2 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nRead All Comments\n\n## Popular Stories\n\n### When to Expect a New Apple TV to Launch\n\nTuesday April 9, 2024 8:30 am PDT by Joe Rossignol\n\nIt has been nearly a year and a half since the current Apple TV was released,\nso the device is becoming due for a hardware upgrade.
