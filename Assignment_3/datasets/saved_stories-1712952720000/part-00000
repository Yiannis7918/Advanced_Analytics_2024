In addition to \u201cMy\nTwo Cents,\u201d she writes about work and parenting for the site. Previously, she\nwas the senior features editor at Harper's Bazaar and a senior editor at the\nCut. She was also the editorial director for MM.LaFleur. Her work has also\nbeen published in Glamour, Art in America, Politico, and other places.\n\n## My Two Cents\n\nFinancial-advice columnist Charlotte Cowles answers readers\u2019 personal\nquestions about personal finance.\n\n## My Two Cents\n\nFinancial-advice columnist Charlotte Cowles answers readers\u2019 personal\nquestions about personal finance.\n\nPhoto-Illustration: by The Cut; Photo: Getty Images\n\nLike any adult with a looming fear of scarcity, I\u2019ve dabbled in online side\nhustles since my teens. One of my longest-running ventures was editing other\npeople\u2019s graduate-school applications in my mid-20s. It was easier than\nbabysitting (I could do it in my pajamas), but it was still labor intensive \u2014\nI got up at 5 a.m. on countless mornings to rewrite strangers\u2019 badly\npunctuated personal essays before putting on real pants to go to my actual job\n(more editing) at 8 a.m. Eventually, it became clear that this revenue stream\n\u2014 roughly a few hundred dollars every fall, when applications were due \u2014\nwasn\u2019t worth the hours it took.\n\nMore recently, the promise of making \u201ceasy\u201d or \u201cpassive\u201d income online has\nreached a fever pitch. \u201cThere\u2019s money everywhere! Go get it!\u201d claims one\nTikToker in a post about how anyone can make $50 an hour creating real-estate\nads on Canva (she has 2.5 million followers). \u201cI turned zero dollars into\n$10,000 using only my phone,\u201d boasts another. \u201cKids are making money way too\neasily right now,\u201d declares the influencer Caden Booth, who has racked up 1.5\nmillion followers mainly by testing various side-hustle ideas. The hashtags\n#makemoneyonline and #sidehustle have 1.5 and 2.5 million posts on TikTok,\nrespectively.\n\nAccording to a recent article in the Washington Post, digital side hustles are\nincreasingly popular among Gen-Z workers because they \u201chave low entry barriers\nto make additional income.\u201d But in an increasingly crowded market, those\nbarriers are higher than they seem. You only hear about the success stories \u2014\nthe man who makes $700 a month from his old fish-tank reviews, or the 25-year-\nold influencer who made $107,000 a year sharing finance tips. The real numbers\nare harder to grasp and a lot less compelling. For every fish-tank guy,\nthere\u2019s hundreds of people trying much harder and earning a lot less, if\nanything at all.\n\nA graphic designer I know thought she could make extra income selling\ntemplates and other printed products online, only to find that she was\nvirtually invisible to potential customers. \u201cIt\u2019s really easy to set up a\nstore website or a shop on Etsy, but the only way you\u2019ll sell anything is if\nyou spend a ton of money on marketing,\u201d she said. \u201cThe algorithms are so\nefficient you only get the eyeballs you pay for. So you will end up spending\nat least as much, if not more, than the revenue you bring in.\u201d Luckily, she\nquit before that happened.\n\nAnother woman I spoke to tried selling foot photos online while she job-hunted\nafter college. \u201cI saw numbers on Twitter and TikTok, like $5,000 to $10,000\nper month, but that\u2019s actually very rare,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just create\nyour profile, prepare your pictures and pricing, and get in touch with\ncustomers.\u201d Instead, after three months of posting photos without any\ntraction, she tried subscribing to the \u201cpremium\u201d versions of the photo-sharing\nplatforms to attract more clients. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t work at all. So I lost more\nmoney!\u201d\n\nStill, there\u2019s a digital business model for every possible pipe dream \u2014 you\ncould do online coaching, make a podcast, earn commissions on stuff you\nconvince people to buy through affiliate links, or vie for ad dollars on\nYouTube. To get a better idea of what\u2019s worth your effort (and what isn\u2019t), I\nspoke to Melissa Jean-Baptiste, a financial educator and author of So ... This\nIs Why I\u2019m Broke: Money Lessons on Financial Literacy, Passive Income, and\nGenerational Wealth. Here are her tips.\n\n## 1\\. Monetize something you\u2019re already doing.\n\nThe best side gigs are the ones that use your existing skills, says Jean-\nBaptiste. She learned this the hard way: After years of dog-walking,\nbabysitting, tutoring, and creating content on YouTube and her personal blog \u2014\non top of working a full-time job as a high-school teacher \u2014 she was exhausted\nand didn\u2019t have much to show for it. Then she realized that she could make a\nfew hundred dollars a month selling her lesson plans to other teachers online.\n\u201cI had already spent hundreds of hours creating these lesson plans, but I was\nthe only one using them,\u201d she says. \u201cOther people were willing to pay for the\nwork I had already done.\u201d\n\nTo figure out what your equivalent product could be, Jean-Baptiste recommends\nmaking a list of five skills that you regularly use and enjoy. \u201cIf you\u2019re\nemployed, what are the top-five things that you do daily or weekly at your\njob?\u201d she asks. Then, pick one and do some research. \u201cExplore what is\nmonetizable with this particular skill, that won\u2019t really take over your\nentire life, and put in a few hours to see how it goes,\u201d she says. She warns\nagainst \u201chustling backward\u201d \u2014 taking a side gig just because it\u2019s available.\n\u201cIf you do that, you\u2019re just shooting in the dark.\u201d\n\n## 2\\. Think about when you need the money \u2014 and remember that building an\naudience can take years.\n\nUnlike her lesson plans, Jean-Baptiste\u2019s YouTube videos didn\u2019t bring in a\npaycheck until six years after she started making them; even then, the ad\nrevenue wasn\u2019t meaningful. \u201cInfluencing is more of a long game,\u201d she says.\nWhile some creators do manage to break out of the pack and make money quickly,\nit takes most people years to build up a big enough following to do so, if\nthey even get to that point.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, banking on income from your followers is risky \u2014 many platforms\nthat help influencers leverage their audience into profits, like Amazon and\nFacebook, can change their algorithms and commission models at any time,\ncreating huge fluctuations in how much money they generate. Natalie Fisher, a\npersonal-finance TikToker, says her income swung between $3,388 and $15,829\nper month last year. So just because you have one successful month doesn\u2019t\nautomatically translate to future earnings.\n\n## 3\\. If you need cash now, be nimble.\n\nFor quicker results, Jean-Baptiste recommends submitting your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to\nLiveOps, a platform that matches independent contractors to virtual short-term\njobs around the country. \u201cFor example, a company might be looking for a\nvirtual assistant or a customer-service representative for 12 weeks. You\nspecify how much time you\u2019re available to work every week, and then you get\npaid,\u201d she says.\n\nAnd if all else fails, there\u2019s always the more traditional side-hustle route.\n\u201cIf you need money right away, you\u2019ll probably have to do a more hands-on,\nphysical side hustle \u2014 like dog-walking or Instacart deliveries \u2014 as opposed\nto a remote side hustle that requires research,\u201d she says. You could also sign\nup for focus groups in your area \u2014 psychology departments at local\nuniversities will often have them. \u201cThey typically start off at about $50 for\nan hour of time. So you\u2019re not going to be making thousands of dollars, but at\nleast you know what you\u2019re getting into.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the day, you can\u2019t monetize every inch of your life. Plus, if\nyour side hustle takes time and energy away from your actual job or career, it\ncould backfire. That\u2019s why Jean-Baptiste recommends exploring just one side\nhustle at a time. \u201cI see a lot of people working an extra 20 or 30 hours a\nweek just to make an extra $100 or $200. Especially if you\u2019re doing that on\ntop of a full-time job, that leads to burnout,\u201d she says. \u201cDon\u2019t overcommit up\nfront.\u201d\n\nEmail your money conundrums to mytwocents@nymag.com (and read our submission\nterms here.)\n\n### Related\n\n  * \u2018My Friend Is in Financial Trouble.
