Previously, he led AI teams at the Chinese\ntech company Baidu and Google, where the team he oversaw taught a computer\nsystem to recognize cats in YouTube videos without ever being taught what a\ncat was.\n\nNg\u2019s addition to the board comes as Amazon, like other tech companies, makes\nmassive investments in generative artificial intelligence.\n\nIn his annual shareholder letter released on Thursday, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy\nsuggested the technology could be the next big pillar of Amazon\u2019s business,\njoining the company\u2019s prominent online marketplace, Prime subscription program\nand its cloud computing unit AWS. Jassy wrote generative AI may be the the\nlargest technological transformation since cloud computing, and \u201cperhaps since\nthe internet.\u201d\n\nSubscribe to the Eye on AI newsletter to stay abreast of how AI is shaping the\nfuture of business.
