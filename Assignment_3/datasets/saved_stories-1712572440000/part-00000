A greater reliance on\ncultivated plant foods, rich in fermentable carbohydrates, resulted in rotting\nteeth.\n\nNow, the analysis of 52 adult dentitions from hunter-gatherer skeletons found\nin a cave in Taforalt, Morocco dating from between 15,000 and 13,700 years ago\nsuggests people suffered tooth decay in much earlier times.\n\nEvidence of decay was found in more than half of the teeth that were intact,\nwith only three skeletons showing no sign of cavities.\n\n#### Living with toothache\n\nMuseum palaeobiologist Isabelle De Groote, who studied the teeth, said: 'These\npeople's mouths were often affected by both cavities in the teeth and\nabscesses, and they would have suffered from frequent toothache.'\n\nArchaeological excavations at the site in Taforalt, including elaborate human\nburial areas, showed evidence of methodical harvesting and processing of wild\nfoods, including sweet acorns, pine nuts and land snails.\n\nMuseum human origins expert Dr Louise Humphrey said a staple diet of edible\nacorns could have been the cause of the dental disease.\n\n'The acorns may have been boiled or ground to make flour; cooking the acorns\nwould have added to their stickiness,' Dr Humphrey said.\n\n#### Pulling teeth\n\nDr Humphrey also speculated that these Pleistocene hunter-gatherers may have\npulled out their own teeth.\n\nSkeletons at Taforalt reveal that most people practiced tooth evulsion,\nwhereby one or two healthy incisors were deliberately removed in late\nchildhood or early adulthood. This would have been for cultural reasons, such\nas indicating group affiliation or as a rite of passage.\n\nThe same skills could have been used to extract diseased teeth and relieve\ndental pain.\n\n0\n\n  * Evolution\n  * Collections\n  * Museum research\n  * Science news\n\n### Explore human evolution\n\nMuseum science is helping to answer where, when and how humans evolved.\n\nExplore our origins\n\n### Don't miss a thing\n\nReceive email updates about our news, science, exhibitions, events, products,\nservices and fundraising activities.
