Credit: Lauren Petracca/New York Times/Redux/eyevine\n\nRanga Dias, the physicist at the centre of the room-temperature\nsuperconductivity scandal, committed data fabrication, falsification and\nplagiarism, according to a investigation commissioned by his university.\nNature\u2019s news team discovered the bombshell investigation report in court\ndocuments.\n\nThe 10-month investigation, which concluded on 8 February, was carried out by\nan independent group of scientists recruited by the University of Rochester in\nNew York. They examined 16 allegations against Dias and concluded that it was\nmore likely than not that in each case, the physicist had committed scientific\nmisconduct. The university is now attempting to fire Dias, who is a tenure-\ntrack faculty member at Rochester, before his contract expires at the end of\nthe 2024\u201325 academic year.\n\nSuperconductivity scandal: the inside story of deception in a rising star\u2019s\nphysics lab\n\nThe investigation report (see Supplementary information) and numerous other\ndocuments came to light as the result of a lawsuit that Dias filed against the\nuniversity in December last year. Dias submitted a grievance to Rochester over\nits decision to remove his students last August, but the university refused to\nhear the grievance on the grounds that it did \u201cnot relate to academic\nfreedom\u201d. The physicist\u2019s lawsuit claims that this response was unreasonable.\nA university spokesperson declined to comment on the specifics of ongoing\nlitigation and personnel matters, but emphasized that Rochester is \u201cvigorously\ndefending its course of action\u201d.\n\nIn March, Nature\u2019s news team uncovered details about how Dias distorted data\nto make claims about room-temperature superconductivity in two now-retracted\npapers published in Nature^1^,^2, and how he manipulated his students to keep\nthem in the dark about those data. (Nature\u2019s news and journal teams are\neditorially independent.) Soon after, the Wall Street Journal reported that\nRochester\u2019s investigation found evidence of misconduct.\n\nNow, Nature\u2019s news team can reveal the details of that investigation.\nDocuments filed by Rochester with the Monroe County Supreme Court show that\nthe investigation was ordered by the National Science Foundation (NSF), a\nmajor funder of US academic research that in 2021 awarded Dias a prestigious\nUS$790,000 CAREER grant. The NSF Office of Inspector General declined to\ncomment to Nature\u2019s news team on the investigation\u2019s findings or the agency\u2019s\nfuture actions.\n\nThe 124-page investigation report is a stunning account of Dias\u2019s deceit\nacross the two Nature papers, as well as two other now-retracted papers \u2014 one\nin Chemical Communications^3 and one in Physical Review Letters (PRL)^4. In\nthe two Nature papers, Dias claimed to have discovered room-temperature\nsuperconductivity \u2014 zero electrical resistance at ambient temperatures \u2014 first\nin a compound made of carbon, sulfur and hydrogen (CSH)^1 and then in a\ncompound eventually found to be made of lutetium and hydrogen (LuH)^2.\n\nCapping years of allegations and analyses, the report methodically documents\nhow Dias deliberately misled his co-authors, journal editors and the\nscientific community. A university spokesperson described the investigation as\n\u201ca fair and thorough process,\u201d which reached the correct conclusion.\n\nDias did not respond to requests for comment. His lawyer referred Nature\u2019s\nnews team to documents filed with the lawsuit. In one of those, Dias said: \u201cIt\nis imperative to reassert the foundational integrity and scientific validity\nof our work amidst the criticisms and accusations.\u201d\n\n## A trio of inquiries\n\nThe NSF-ordered investigation wasn\u2019t the first time Rochester examined\npossible problems in Dias\u2019s laboratory. Between 2021 and 2022, the university\nconducted three preliminary \u2018inquiries\u2019 into the CSH Nature paper^1 \u2014 some\ndetails of which are now revealed by the investigation report. Any of the\ninquiries could have decided that a full misconduct investigation was\nwarranted, but none of them did.\n\nThe first inquiry was initiated after Jorge Hirsch, a condensed-matter\ntheorist at the University of California, San Diego, sent complaints to\nRochester. The university asked three unnamed internal reviewers, and Dias\ncontacted one external reviewer to examine Hirsch\u2019s claims. Information in the\nreport suggests that the external reviewer is Maddury Somayazulu, a physicist\nat Argonne National Laboratory in Lemont, Illinois.\n\nHirsch alleged that there were problems with the paper\u2019s magnetic\nsusceptibility data \u2014 evidence crucial to Dias\u2019s claim that CSH is a room-\ntemperature superconductor. The inquiry came to the conclusion on 19 January\n2022 that there was \u201cno credible evidence to warrant further investigation\u201d.\n\nThe second inquiry was prompted by Dirk van der Marel, editor-in-chief of\nPhysica C, a journal for superconductivity research. Van der Marel sent\nRochester his own concerns about the same CSH data on 20 January 2022 \u2014 just a\nday after the first inquiry ended. Another reviewer took up the case and\njudged no formal investigation was warranted on 6 April of that year. Their\nwork was checked by a second reviewer, who appears to be Russell Hemley, a\nphysicist at the University of Illinois Chicago, based on identifying\ninformation in the report. Although the reviewers did not support an\ninvestigation, they said that the paper was \u201cverging on misleading due to\nomission of details\u201d. They recommended that an erratum be applied (none was).\n\nRochester\u2019s investigation notes that two reviewers \u2014 apparently Somayazulu and\nHemley \u2014 have collaborated with Dias on several papers, including a study^5 in\n2021 about the properties of CSH. Rochester\u2019s academic misconduct policy\nstates that \u201cno individual who has an unresolved personal, professional or\nfinancial conflict of interest ... should participate in the proceedings\u201d of\nan inquiry.\n\nA spokesperson for Argonne denied that Somayazulu was an inquiry reviewer, but\ndid not respond when asked why a footnote in the investigation refers to\n\u201cReport of Somayazulu_Review of NSF 2020 (CSH) Paper\u201d. Hemley did not clarify\nwhether he was an inquiry reviewer.\n\nNature's journals team conducted its own investigation into the CSH paper\nusing independent reviewers, two of whom found evidence that the magnetic\nsusceptibility data were probably fabricated. When the journal indicated that\nit would retract the CSH paper, and in response to another complaint from\nHirsch, the university conducted a third inquiry. Despite having access to\nNature\u2019s findings, the single reviewer assigned to this inquiry \u2014 the same\nanonymous reviewer from the second inquiry \u2014 concluded on 19 October 2022 that\nany oddities in the data could be attributed to how they were processed, and\nthat no investigation was needed.\n\nRochester\u2019s inquiries \u201cshould be \u2018Exhibit A\u2019 about how not to run one of these\nthings,\u201d says Peter Armitage, a condensed-matter experimentalist at Johns\nHopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\n## Under investigation\n\nRochester was finally forced to launch a full investigation to determine\nmisconduct by the NSF. In October 2022, James Hamlin, a physicist at the\nUniversity of Florida in Gainesville, submitted concerns about Dias\u2019s work to\nthe NSF. These included \u201cdata discrepancies that cannot be attributed to data\nprocessing\u201d, according to a 16 March 2023 letter from the NSF to Stephen\nDewhurst, the then-interim vice-president for research at Rochester.\n\nWithin weeks, Dewhurst assembled a committee of three physicists external to\nRochester \u201cto ensure that this investigation would be credible\u201d: Marius Millot\nand Peter Celliers, both at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in\nCalifornia; and Marcus Knudson, at Sandia National Laboratories in\nAlbuquerque, New Mexico.\n\nNature retracts controversial superconductivity paper by embattled physicist\n\nNature\u2019s news team asked several superconductivity researchers to review the\ninvestigation report. At first, they were concerned by the university\u2019s choice\nof committee members. The three physicists are specialists in shock-wave\nphysics, not in superconductivity. Millot and Celliers were also co-authors\nwith Dias on a 27-author review paper published earlier this year^6.\n\nHowever, those doubts evaporated when the researchers read the report. \u201cI\ncouldn\u2019t help but be incredibly impressed,\u201d Armitage says. Paul Canfield, a\nphysicist at Iowa State University in Ames, says: \u201cThere should be a good\nGerman word that\u2019s 50 letters long and is simultaneously \u2018impressive\u2019 and\n\u2018depressing\u2019\u201d to describe the report. Brad Ramshaw, a physicist at Cornell\nUniversity in Ithaca, New York, concurs. \u201cThis is a great sacrifice of their\ntime,\u201d he says. \u201cThe whole community should be grateful that we have\ncolleagues who are willing to go to these lengths.\u201d\n\nThe three investigators did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe investigation committee secured records, including data on computer hard\ndrives, e-mails and physical notebooks, in the course of their work. They also\nconducted interviews with 10 individuals connected with the case, including\nDias and some of his former students, and met at least 50 times to deliberate.\n\n\u2018A very disturbing picture\u2019: another retraction imminent for controversial\nphysicist\n\nNotably, the investigators confirmed previous analyses by van der Marel,\nHirsch, Hamlin and Ramshaw \u2014 all of whom found apparent evidence that Dias\nfabricated magnetic susceptibility data in the CSH paper.\n\nThe report clarifies the extent of this misconduct: first Dias fabricated CSH\ndata and published it. Then, when its origins came under scrutiny, Dias and\nhis collaborator and co-author Ashkan Salamat, a physicist at the University\nof Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), released a set of fabricated raw data.\n\nQuestions about discrepancies between the raw and the published data continued\nto mount, so Dias crafted an explanation \u2014 he claimed to have used an\nelaborate data-processing method for the published data. This provided \u201ca\nveneer of plausibility, by focusing critics\u2019 attention on background\nsubtraction methods\u201d instead of on the raw data, the investigation committee\nwrote.\n\nSalamat did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n## Fact finding\n\nAt any time throughout the investigation, Dias could have dispelled many\nallegations if he had provided genuine raw data \u2014 data taken directly from a\nmeasuring instrument and containing details such as timestamps. \u201cThe absence\nof certain raw data files does not inherently indicate their non-existence or\nsuggest any misconduct on my part,\u201d Dias wrote in response to the\ninvestigation findings. Yet he promised to deliver raw data multiple times and\nnever did, according to the report.\n\nIn several instances, the investigation found, Dias intentionally misled his\nteam members and collaborators about the origins of data. Through interviews,\nthe investigators worked out that Dias had told his partners at UNLV that\nmeasurements were taken at Rochester, but had told researchers at Rochester\nthat they were taken at UNLV.\n\nDias also lied to journals. In the case of the retracted PRL paper^4 \u2014 which\nwas about the electrical properties of manganese disulfide (MnS_2) \u2014 the\njournal conducted its own investigation and concluded that there was apparent\nfabrication and \u201ca deliberate attempt to obstruct the investigation\u201d by\nproviding reviewers with manipulated data rather than raw data. The\ninvestigators commissioned by Rochester confirmed the journal\u2019s findings that\nDias had taken electrical resistance data on germanium tetraselenide from his\nown PhD thesis and passed these data off as coming from MnS_2 \u2014 a completely\ndifferent material with different properties (see \u2018Odd similarity\u2019). When\nquestioned about this by the investigators, Dias sent them the same\nmanipulated data that was sent to PRL.\n\nHow exactly Dias distorted data was clearest in the report\u2019s findings about\nthe LuH paper^2. With the aid of Dias\u2019s former students, the investigation\ncommittee pinpointed raw data on the lab\u2019s hard drives. These data showed that\nDias frequently made selective omissions to conceal \u201cerratic drops and jumps\nin the resistance data, the presence of which would undermine the claim of\nsuperconducting behavior in LuH\u201d, the investigation committee wrote.\n\nDias, the investigation committee found, \u201crepeatedly lied\u201d about data during\nNature\u2019s review of the paper after concerns came to light. But perhaps the\nmost egregious instance of misconduct, which the report refers to as involving\n\u201cprofuse manipulations\u201d of data, occurred when Dias inverted a set of LuH data\nso that it demonstrated the Meissner effect \u2014 a sharp change in the magnetic\nproperties of a material that is a hallmark of superconductivity. On 27 August\n2022, Sachith Dissanayake, a co-author who was then a faculty member working\nwith Dias at Rochester, explained to Dias that the data had been improperly\nmanipulated, but Dias ignored the warning, according to the report. In his\nresponse to the report, Dias claimed Dissanayake misunderstood the data.\nDissanayake did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThese manipulated data were key to the LuH paper\u2019s acceptance. And the\ninvestigation committee concluded that Dias fabricated data \u201cto convince\nNature editors and pre-publication referees that LuH exhibits\nsuperconductivity at room temperature\u201d.\n\nPrevious stories in Physics Magazine and Science reported allegations of\nserial plagiarism by Dias, including that he copied more than 20% of his 2013\nthesis from other sources. The Rochester investigators uncovered another, more\nrecent instance: on 30 July 2020, researchers, including Dias\u2019s colleagues at\nRochester, submitted a scientific manuscript^7 to the preprint server arXiv.\nTwelve days later, Dias submitted an NSF grant proposal that included\nparagraphs copied from that manuscript, as well as two identical figures. That\nproposal later won Dias the CAREER grant from the agency. In his response to\nthe investigation, Dias admits to \u201cinstances where references are\ninadvertently missed\u201d.\n\n## Closing arguments\n\nThe investigation committee sent Dias a draft copy of its report on 22\nDecember last year. In a two-part response totalling hundreds of pages, which\nwas revealed in the lawsuit, Dias attacks the expertise and integrity of the\ninvestigators. The physicist asserts that the investigators\u2019 approach displays\n\u201ctraits that could sometimes be seen in the realm of conspiracy theories\u201d and\nthat it is \u201clacking a robust logical foundation\u201d. Dias also claims that\nSalamat convinced Dias\u2019s former students to oppose him when they sent a letter\nto Nature asking to retract the LuH paper. The opposite is true: Nature\u2019s news\nteam previously reported that it was the students who initiated the letter.\n\nWhy superconductor research is in a \u2018golden age\u2019 \u2014 despite controversy\n\nNowhere in the response does Dias provide the raw data requested by the\ncommittee. In their final report, the investigators respond to Dias\u2019s\naccusations, saying that the \u201cinvocation of baroque explanations to interpret,\nand therefore justify, the omission of these data does not alter the\nInvestigation Committee\u2019s reasoning or findings\u201d.\n\nUltimately, the committee found that the Rochester students and Dissanayake\nwere not culpable, but victims. The committee did not have access to resources\nat UNLV to clear those researchers, including Salamat, from blame, but it\nconcluded that those parties too were deceived, and did not find \u201csubstantial\nevidence of wrongdoing\u201d.\n\nAs a result, the investigators recommended that Dias should not be permitted\nto teach or to carry out public or privately funded research. They added:\n\u201cEvidence uncovered in this investigation shows that [Dias] cannot be\ntrusted\u201d.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-00976-y\n\nThe author of this story is related to Robert Garisto, the chief editor of\nPRL.
