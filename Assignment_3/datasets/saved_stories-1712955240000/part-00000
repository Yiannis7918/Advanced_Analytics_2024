Secret behind Airbnb's Billion-Dollar Empire\n\n  2. A tool to find awesome lists on all kinds of interesting topics\n\n  3. One recommended video on how to social engineer your way into anything\n\n### Secret behind Airbnb's Billon Dollar Empire\n\nAirbnb definitely has one of the most impressive growth stories but most\npeople don't know how Airbnb actually started.\n\nSilicon Valley wants you to believe that their unicorn startups succeeded\ndoing things legally.\n\nBut that couldn't be far from truth.\n\nFor starters, Airbnb used multiple Gmail accounts to spam Craigslist.\n\n\u275d\n\n\"They posted unrealistically (fake) cheap rentals of beautiful apartments in\nplaces where normal rent should be 10x more. Once people replied, they auto-\nresponded that the unit has been rented, but they should be looking for\nanother unit on AirBnB.\"\n\nAt one point in time, Craigslist was used for everything from Dating Sites\nknown as Personals to Vacation Listings like Airbnb before they were unbundled\none-by-one by Silicon Valley's startups like Tinder, Airbnb and many more.\n\nUnbundling of Craigslist\n\nThe Game of Blackhat is a cat-and-mouse game.\n\nYou need a lot of guardrails to protect yourself from people using your Social\nSite by spamming their products.\n\nCraigslist is a small team of 30 people.\n\nThere's stuff AI can automate now with such a small team but back then, it\nwasn't possible.\n\nAirbnb used Craigslist as its playground to spam Craigslist visitors to grow\ntheir supply-side.\n\nIn a 2-sided marketplace, growing both supply and demand is very important.\nAnd both must grow at the same time for the marketplace to work.\n\nAirbnb Blackhat Strategy to grow their Supply Side\n\nThese findings were discovered by a Blackhat himself with proof as he set a\nmouse-trap on Craigslist.\n\nWhat he did was create a new test site to get vacation rental owners to sign-\nup so that he can test his Airbnb theory.\n\nHe grabbed their real email-addresses (not Craigslist anonymous addresses) via\nCraigslist by specifically targeting those who were advertising their vacation\nrentals on Craigslist.\n\nHe skipped over the other categories that were directly related to AirBnB's\nbusiness model because they didn't fit with the test site he built.\n\nOnce he got 1000+ sign-ups, he then took it upon himself to post it to the\nadvertising section on Craigslist.\n\nEmail from Airbnb on Craigslist Listing\n\nHe did the same in Week 2 and Week 3 to test if it wasn't a one-time thing.\n\nEmail from Airbnb on Craigslist Listing on Week 3\n\nSurely, it wasn't a fluke.\n\nAfter posting 4 ads on Craigslist in 3 weeks, he received 5 identical emails\nfrom 2 ladies who were raving fans of AirBnB and spent their days emailing\nCraigslist advertisers.\n\nThis is one of the greatest blackhat strategies used in the real world to\nbuild a billion-dollar marketplace by growing the supply-side with pure\nblackhat.\n\nThese strategies are not mentioned in Press Interviews, Media, or any Founder\nstories but this is probably the most important piece of the puzzle. Without\nit, Airbnb probably wouldn't have survived.\n\n\"Some very famous investors have alluded to the fact that they look for a\ndangerous streak in the entrepreneurs they invest in...and while those\ninvestors will never come out and tell you what they mean, this kind of thing\nis probably what they mean.\"\n\nDave Gooden\n\nNobody would've found out what Airbnb did if it weren't for Dave's findings.\n\n> airbnb used a cool growth hack by asking their users to post their couch on\n> craigslist as well.\n>\n> craigslist didn't ask them to but initially airbnb didn't have as much\n> demand so they stole the demand from craigslist.\n>\n> they reduced friction by making it a 1-click solution.\n>\n> \u2014 Startup Spells \ud83e\ude84 (@StartupSpells) Dec 13, 2021\n\nI'm wondering how many startups have employed similar strategies in their\nearly days that aren't mentioned in any book nor will it get any coverage?\nOnly the founders and the early marketers would know.\n\nThe conversation on Hacker News about this topic has interesting insights as\nit violates CAN-SPAM.\n\n> \"CAN-SPAM, sending from a fake address (illegal headers). CA has a specific\n> law that pre-empts CAN-SPAM that definitely makes this illegal if sent from\n> CA.\"\n\n> \"It's commercial email 100%. Probably a fake sender name (illegal), against\n> gmail ToS, against CL ToS and no unsubscribe link and no one even subscribed\n> in the first place. 100% against CAN-SPAM.\"\n\nA few months back, I was checking Twitter when I came across these 2\ninteresting tweets:\n\nSmart Criminals.

Yep, she's currently in\njail.\n\nHer skillset included Social Engineering.\n\nSocial Engineering is how you subtly get information from strangers or your\ncompetitors, without them knowing.\n\nIn our day-to-day lives, we give so much information to strangers by talking\ntoo much.\n\n3 innocent questions by a stranger and bam, they can get all the info they\nneed on you pretty easily.\n\nYou can get someone's phone number, their address, their bank account or\nliterally anything you want.\n\nI recommend watching this unlisted video by Heather Graham where she gives a\nbasic rundown on how she did Social Engineering. You can't search it through\nYouTube since its unlisted so make sure to add it to Watch Later if you can't\nwatch it right now.\n\nIf you want to watch the best movie scene on Social Engineering, watch this 3\nmins video from the German movie \"Who Am I?\" (2014). The movie is great too.\n\n### Rabbit Hole Reads\n\n  1. The 80-hour Myth - Do you really need to work 80 hours?
