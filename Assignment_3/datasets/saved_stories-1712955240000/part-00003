A declaration of members\u2019 interests, of a sort.\nSo, I am going to be talking to you about reading. I\u2019m going to tell you that\nlibraries are important. I\u2019m going to suggest that reading fiction, that\nreading for pleasure, is one of the most important things one can do. I\u2019m\ngoing to make an impassioned plea for people to understand what libraries and\nlibrarians are, and to preserve both of these things.\n\nAnd I am biased, obviously and enormously: I\u2019m an author, often an author of\nfiction. I write for children and for adults. For about 30 years I have been\nearning my living through my words, mostly by making things up and writing\nthem down. It is obviously in my interest for people to read, for them to read\nfiction, for libraries and librarians to exist and help foster a love of\nreading and places in which reading can occur.\n\nSo I\u2019m biased as a writer. But I am much, much more biased as a reader. And I\nam even more biased as a British citizen.\n\nAnd I\u2019m here giving this talk tonight, under the auspices of the Reading\nAgency: a charity whose mission is to give everyone an equal chance in life by\nhelping people become confident and enthusiastic readers. Which supports\nliteracy programs, and libraries and individuals and nakedly and wantonly\nencourages the act of reading. Because, they tell us, everything changes when\nwe read.\n\nAnd it\u2019s that change, and that act of reading that I\u2019m here to talk about\ntonight. I want to talk about what reading does. What it\u2019s good for.\n\nI was once in New York, and I listened to a talk about the building of private\nprisons \u2013 a huge growth industry in America. The prison industry needs to plan\nits future growth \u2013 how many cells are they going to need? How many prisoners\nare there going to be, 15 years from now? And they found they could predict it\nvery easily, using a pretty simple algorithm, based on asking what percentage\nof 10 and 11-year-olds couldn\u2019t read. And certainly couldn\u2019t read for\npleasure.\n\nIt\u2019s not one to one: you can\u2019t say that a literate society has no criminality.\nBut there are very real correlations.\n\nAnd I think some of those correlations, the simplest, come from something very\nsimple. Literate people read fiction.\n\nFiction has two uses. Firstly, it\u2019s a gateway drug to reading. The drive to\nknow what happens next, to want to turn the page, the need to keep going, even\nif it\u2019s hard, because someone\u2019s in trouble and you have to know how it\u2019s all\ngoing to end ... that\u2019s a very real drive. And it forces you to learn new\nwords, to think new thoughts, to keep going. To discover that reading per se\nis pleasurable. Once you learn that, you\u2019re on the road to reading everything.\nAnd reading is key. There were noises made briefly, a few years ago, about the\nidea that we were living in a post-literate world, in which the ability to\nmake sense out of written words was somehow redundant, but those days are\ngone: words are more important than they ever were: we navigate the world with\nwords, and as the world slips onto the web, we need to follow, to communicate\nand to comprehend what we are reading. People who cannot understand each other\ncannot exchange ideas, cannot communicate, and translation programs only go so\nfar.\n\nThe simplest way to make sure that we raise literate children is to teach them\nto read, and to show them that reading is a pleasurable activity. And that\nmeans, at its simplest, finding books that they enjoy, giving them access to\nthose books, and letting them read them.\n\nI don\u2019t think there is such a thing as a bad book for children. Every now and\nagain it becomes fashionable among some adults to point at a subset of\nchildren\u2019s books, a genre, perhaps, or an author, and to declare them bad\nbooks, books that children should be stopped from reading. I\u2019ve seen it happen\nover and over; Enid Blyton was declared a bad author, so was RL Stine, so were\ndozens of others. Comics have been decried as fostering illiteracy.\n\nNo such thing as a bad writer... Enid Blyton\u2019s Famous Five. Photograph: Greg\nBalfour Evans/Alamy\n\nIt\u2019s tosh. It\u2019s snobbery and it\u2019s foolishness. There are no bad authors for\nchildren, that children like and want to read and seek out, because every\nchild is different. They can find the stories they need to, and they bring\nthemselves to stories. A hackneyed, worn-out idea isn\u2019t hackneyed and worn out\nto them. This is the first time the child has encountered it. Do not\ndiscourage children from reading because you feel they are reading the wrong\nthing. Fiction you do not like is a route to other books you may prefer. And\nnot everyone has the same taste as you.\n\nWell-meaning adults can easily destroy a child\u2019s love of reading: stop them\nreading what they enjoy, or give them worthy-but-dull books that you like, the\n21st-century equivalents of Victorian \u201cimproving\u201d literature. You\u2019ll wind up\nwith a generation convinced that reading is uncool and worse, unpleasant.\n\nWe need our children to get onto the reading ladder: anything that they enjoy\nreading will move them up, rung by rung, into literacy. (Also, do not do what\nthis author did when his 11-year-old daughter was into RL Stine, which is to\ngo and get a copy of Stephen King\u2019s Carrie, saying if you liked those you\u2019ll\nlove this! Holly read nothing but safe stories of settlers on prairies for the\nrest of her teenage years, and still glares at me when Stephen King\u2019s name is\nmentioned.)\n\nAnd the second thing fiction does is to build empathy. When you watch TV or\nsee a film, you are looking at things happening to other people. Prose fiction\nis something you build up from 26 letters and a handful of punctuation marks,\nand you, and you alone, using your imagination, create a world and people it\nand look out through other eyes. You get to feel things, visit places and\nworlds you would never otherwise know. You learn that everyone else out there\nis a me, as well. You\u2019re being someone else, and when you return to your own\nworld, you\u2019re going to be slightly changed.\n\nEmpathy is a tool for building people into groups, for allowing us to function\nas more than self-obsessed individuals.\n\nYou\u2019re also finding out something as you read vitally important for making\nyour way in the world. And it\u2019s this:\n\nThe world doesn\u2019t have to be like this. Things can be different.\n\nI was in China in 2007, at the first party-approved science fiction and\nfantasy convention in Chinese history. And at one point I took a top official\naside and asked him Why? SF had been disapproved of for a long time. What had\nchanged?\n\nIt\u2019s simple, he told me. The Chinese were brilliant at making things if other\npeople brought them the plans. But they did not innovate and they did not\ninvent. They did not imagine. So they sent a delegation to the US, to Apple,\nto Microsoft, to Google, and they asked the people there who were inventing\nthe future about themselves. And they found that all of them had read science\nfiction when they were boys or girls.\n\nFiction can show you a different world. It can take you somewhere you\u2019ve never\nbeen. Once you\u2019ve visited other worlds, like those who ate fairy fruit, you\ncan never be entirely content with the world that you grew up in. Discontent\nis a good thing: discontented people can modify and improve their worlds,\nleave them better, leave them different.\n\nAnd while we\u2019re on the subject, I\u2019d like to say a few words about escapism. I\nhear the term bandied about as if it\u2019s a bad thing. As if \u201cescapist\u201d fiction\nis a cheap opiate used by the muddled and the foolish and the deluded, and the\nonly fiction that is worthy, for adults or for children, is mimetic fiction,\nmirroring the worst of the world the reader finds herself in.\n\nIf you were trapped in an impossible situation, in an unpleasant place, with\npeople who meant you ill, and someone offered you a temporary escape, why\nwouldn\u2019t you take it? And escapist fiction is just that: fiction that opens a\ndoor, shows the sunlight outside, gives you a place to go where you are in\ncontrol, are with people you want to be with(and books are real places, make\nno mistake about that); and more importantly, during your escape, books can\nalso give you knowledge about the world and your predicament, give you\nweapons, give you armour: real things you can take back into your prison.\nSkills and knowledge and tools you can use to escape for real.\n\nAs JRR Tolkien reminded us, the only people who inveigh against escape are\njailers.\n\nTolkien\u2019s illustration of Bilbo\u2019s home, Bag End. Photograph: HarperCollins\n\nAnother way to destroy a child\u2019s love of reading, of course, is to make sure\nthere are no books of any kind around. And to give them nowhere to read those\nbooks. I was lucky. I had an excellent local library growing up. I had the\nkind of parents who could be persuaded to drop me off in the library on their\nway to work in summer holidays, and the kind of librarians who did not mind a\nsmall, unaccompanied boy heading back into the children\u2019s library every\nmorning and working his way through the card catalogue, looking for books with\nghosts or magic or rockets in them, looking for vampires or detectives or\nwitches or wonders. And when I had finished reading the children\u2019s\u2019 library I\nbegan on the adult books.\n\nThey were good librarians. They liked books and they liked the books being\nread. They taught me how to order books from other libraries on inter-library\nloans. They had no snobbery about anything I read. They just seemed to like\nthat there was this wide-eyed little boy who loved to read, and would talk to\nme about the books I was reading, they would find me other books in a series,\nthey would help. They treated me as another reader \u2013 nothing less or more \u2013\nwhich meant they treated me with respect. I was not used to being treated with\nrespect as an eight-year-old.\n\nBut libraries are about freedom. Freedom to read, freedom of ideas, freedom of\ncommunication. They are about education (which is not a process that finishes\nthe day we leave school or university), about entertainment, about making safe\nspaces, and about access to information.\n\nI worry that here in the 21st century people misunderstand what libraries are\nand the purpose of them. If you perceive a library as a shelf of books, it may\nseem antiquated or outdated in a world in which most, but not all, books in\nprint exist digitally. But that is to miss the point fundamentally.\n\nI think it has to do with nature of information. Information has value, and\nthe right information has enormous value. For all of human history, we have\nlived in a time of information scarcity, and having the needed information was\nalways important, and always worth something: when to plant crops, where to\nfind things, maps and histories and stories \u2013 they were always good for a meal\nand company. Information was a valuable thing, and those who had it or could\nobtain it could charge for that service.\n\nIn the last few years, we\u2019ve moved from an information-scarce economy to one\ndriven by an information glut. According to Eric Schmidt of Google, every two\ndays now the human race creates as much information as we did from the dawn of\ncivilisation until 2003. That\u2019s about five exobytes of data a day, for those\nof you keeping score. The challenge becomes, not finding that scarce plant\ngrowing in the desert, but finding a specific plant growing in a jungle. We\nare going to need help navigating that information to find the thing we\nactually need.\n\nPhotograph: Alamy\n\nLibraries are places that people go to for information. Books are only the tip\nof the information iceberg: they are there, and libraries can provide you\nfreely and legally with books. More children are borrowing books from\nlibraries than ever before \u2013 books of all kinds: paper and digital and audio.\nBut libraries are also, for example, places that people, who may not have\ncomputers, who may not have internet connections, can go online without paying\nanything: hugely important when the way you find out about jobs, apply for\njobs or apply for benefits is increasingly migrating exclusively online.\nLibrarians can help these people navigate that world.\n\nI do not believe that all books will or should migrate onto screens: as\nDouglas Adams once pointed out to me, more than 20 years before the Kindle\nturned up, a physical book is like a shark. Sharks are old: there were sharks\nin the ocean before the dinosaurs. And the reason there are still sharks\naround is that sharks are better at being sharks than anything else is.\nPhysical books are tough, hard to destroy, bath-resistant, solar-operated,\nfeel good in your hand: they are good at being books, and there will always be\na place for them. They belong in libraries, just as libraries have already\nbecome places you can go to get access to ebooks, and audiobooks and DVDs and\nweb content.\n\nA library is a place that is a repository of information and gives every\ncitizen equal access to it. That includes health information. And mental\nhealth information. It\u2019s a community space. It\u2019s a place of safety, a haven\nfrom the world. It\u2019s a place with librarians in it. What the libraries of the\nfuture will be like is something we should be imagining now.\n\nLiteracy is more important than ever it was, in this world of text and email,\na world of written information. We need to read and write, we need global\ncitizens who can read comfortably, comprehend what they are reading,\nunderstand nuance, and make themselves understood.\n\nLibraries really are the gates to the future. So it is unfortunate that, round\nthe world, we observe local authorities seizing the opportunity to close\nlibraries as an easy way to save money, without realising that they are\nstealing from the future to pay for today. They are closing the gates that\nshould be open.\n\nAccording to a recent study by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment, England is the \u201conly country where the oldest age group has\nhigher proficiency in both literacy and numeracy than the youngest group,\nafter other factors, such as gender, socio-economic backgrounds and type of\noccupations are taken into account\u201d.\n\nOr to put it another way, our children and our grandchildren are less literate\nand less numerate than we are. They are less able to navigate the world, to\nunderstand it to solve problems. They can be more easily lied to and misled,\nwill be less able to change the world in which they find themselves, be less\nemployable. All of these things. And as a country, England will fall behind\nother developed nations because it will lack a skilled workforce.\n\nBooks are the way that we communicate with the dead. The way that we learn\nlessons from those who are no longer with us, that humanity has built on\nitself, progressed, made knowledge incremental rather than something that has\nto be relearned, over and over. There are tales that are older than most\ncountries, tales that have long outlasted the cultures and the buildings in\nwhich they were first told.\n\nI think we have responsibilities to the future. Responsibilities and\nobligations to children, to the adults those children will become, to the\nworld they will find themselves inhabiting. All of us \u2013 as readers, as\nwriters, as citizens \u2013 have obligations. I thought I\u2019d try and spell out some\nof these obligations here.\n\nI believe we have an obligation to read for pleasure, in private and in public\nplaces. If we read for pleasure, if others see us reading, then we learn, we\nexercise our imaginations. We show others that reading is a good thing.\n\nWe have an obligation to support libraries. To use libraries, to encourage\nothers to use libraries, to protest the closure of libraries. If you do not\nvalue libraries then you do not value information or culture or wisdom. You\nare silencing the voices of the past and you are damaging the future.\n\nWe have an obligation to read aloud to our children. To read them things they\nenjoy. To read to them stories we are already tired of. To do the voices, to\nmake it interesting, and not to stop reading to them just because they learn\nto read to themselves. Use reading-aloud time as bonding time, as time when no\nphones are being checked, when the distractions of the world are put aside.\n\nWe have an obligation to use the language. To push ourselves: to find out what\nwords mean and how to deploy them, to communicate clearly, to say what we\nmean. We must not to attempt to freeze language, or to pretend it is a dead\nthing that must be revered, but we should use it as a living thing, that\nflows, that borrows words, that allows meanings and pronunciations to change\nwith time.\n\nWe writers \u2013 and especially writers for children, but all writers \u2013 have an\nobligation to our readers: it\u2019s the obligation to write true things,\nespecially important when we are creating tales of people who do not exist in\nplaces that never were \u2013 to understand that truth is not in what happens but\nwhat it tells us about who we are. Fiction is the lie that tells the truth,\nafter all. We have an obligation not to bore our readers, but to make them\nneed to turn the pages. One of the best cures for a reluctant reader, after\nall, is a tale they cannot stop themselves from reading. And while we must\ntell our readers true things and give them weapons and give them armour and\npass on whatever wisdom we have gleaned from our short stay on this green\nworld, we have an obligation not to preach, not to lecture, not to force\npredigested morals and messages down our readers\u2019 throats like adult birds\nfeeding their babies pre-masticated maggots; and we have an obligation never,\never, under any circumstances, to write anything for children that we would\nnot want to read ourselves.\n\nWe have an obligation to understand and to acknowledge that as writers for\nchildren we are doing important work, because if we mess it up and write dull\nbooks that turn children away from reading and from books, we \u2018ve lessened our\nown future and diminished theirs.\n\nWe all \u2013 adults and children, writers and readers \u2013 have an obligation to\ndaydream. We have an obligation to imagine. It is easy to pretend that nobody\ncan change anything, that we are in a world in which society is huge and the\nindividual is less than nothing: an atom in a wall, a grain of rice in a rice\nfield. But the truth is, individuals change their world over and over,\nindividuals make the future, and they do it by imagining that things can be\ndifferent.\n\nLook around you: I mean it. Pause, for a moment and look around the room that\nyou are in. I\u2019m going to point out something so obvious that it tends to be\nforgotten. It\u2019s this: that everything you can see, including the walls, was,\nat some point, imagined. Someone decided it was easier to sit on a chair than\non the ground and imagined the chair. Someone had to imagine a way that I\ncould talk to you in London right now without us all getting rained on.This\nroom and the things in it, and all the other things in this building, this\ncity, exist because, over and over and over, people imagined things.\n\nWe have an obligation to make things beautiful. Not to leave the world uglier\nthan we found it, not to empty the oceans, not to leave our problems for the\nnext generation. We have an obligation to clean up after ourselves, and not\nleave our children with a world we\u2019ve shortsightedly messed up, shortchanged,\nand crippled.\n\nWe have an obligation to tell our politicians what we want, to vote against\npoliticians of whatever party who do not understand the value of reading in\ncreating worthwhile citizens, who do not want to act to preserve and protect\nknowledge and encourage literacy. This is not a matter of party politics. This\nis a matter of common humanity.\n\nAlbert Einstein was asked once how we could make our children intelligent. His\nreply was both simple and wise. \u201cIf you want your children to be intelligent,\u201d\nhe said, \u201cread them fairy tales. If you want them to be more intelligent, read\nthem more fairy tales.\u201d He understood the value of reading, and of imagining.\nI hope we can give our children a world in which they will read, and be read\nto, and imagine, and understand.\n\nThis is an edited version of Neil Gaiman\u2019s lecture for the Reading Agency,\ndelivered on Monday October 14 at the Barbican in London.
