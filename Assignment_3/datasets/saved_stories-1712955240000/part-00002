On one hand: yeah, just like every other industry! On the other\nhand, there are some glaring reasons to think that the book business \u2014 the\nwhole sprawling chain, from writing to publishing to selling \u2014 is overdue for\nits own big wave of unionization. Book workers, unite! You have nothing to\nlose but the branded tote bags they give you instead of raises.\n\nContrary to conventional wisdom, any type of worker, in any type of workplace,\nin any area can be convinced to organize. The hard part is just helping people\nunderstand exactly what they are losing by not having a union, and what they\ncan do about it. This process of education and empowerment that precedes union\ndrives can be more or less difficult depending on how easily employees can be\nmisled, intimidated, or bought off by management. For these reasons, the\nsweetest of sweet spots for union organizing is often \u201covereducated, underpaid\nworkers.\u201d Hmm. . . where do these sorts of workers work?\n\nYou know the answers. These workers, who my former colleagues and I at Gawker\nused to refer to as the \u201ccreative underclass,\u201d can be found in great numbers\nin academia, higher education, journalism and media, and the high prestige,\nlow-pay precincts of the cultural world at museums and other institutions. In\nother words: in many of the industries that have, in recent years, been\nfeverishly unionizing. By and large, these workers went to school and got\neducated as they were told to do \u2014 often at fancy schools, which left them in\ngreat debt \u2014 and then emerged to find that, contrary to all that stuff they\nhad heard about Hard Work and the American Dream, their education did not\ntranslate into a decent living.\n\nThis basic dynamic, from higher ed to media to the cultural world, has been\nlike Miracle-Gro for union organizing \u2014 the one thing that these workers\nunderstand can rearrange the power imbalance that is screwing them over.\n\nThe book world, though, has been something of an outlier. Writers themselves\nmay very well have passed through unions when they were on campus or working\nin media, but the permanent workers of the book industry mostly have not. Of\nthe \u201cBig Five\u201d publishers, only HarperCollins is unionized. (My own publisher,\nHachette, is not.) Last year, workers at HarperCollins went on strike for more\nthan two months in a fight over the modest demand of a $50,000 per year salary\nminimum, which gives you a good idea of the industry\u2019s traditionally low\nwages.\n\nThrough all of the past century\u2019s labor uprisings, publishing has largely\nmanaged to sustain its ability to leverage its own cultural cachet \u2014 a\nglamorous literary dream job, in dazzling New York City! \u2014 to pay peanuts to\nworkers who want to be a part of it. To launch a union drive in a competitive,\nhighly consolidated industry like that always runs the risk of being cast out\nof the place that you have dreamed to work your whole life. The unionized\nworkers at HarperCollins have therefore been stuck with the heroic but unfair\ntask of carrying the whole industry\u2019s labor standards on their shoulders.\n\nMajor publishers are a glaring target for unions. They sit roughly adjacent to\nthe media industry, where unions have been feasting for nearly a decade now,\nand to the entertainment industry, where unions are more energized than ever\nafter a 2023 characterized by two national strikes. (On top of that, Simon &\nSchuster, one of the Big Five, was bought by a private equity firm last year,\nwhich is always and everywhere a flashing red warning sign for employees to\nunionize before the financial vultures attack.)\n\nBesides the natural benefit to workers, unionization of publishers is an\nimportant part of the long-term project of organizing the entire supply chain\nof American culture. Movies, media, music, books \u2014 the things that are,\nbesides bombs, America\u2019s most potent global export \u2014 should all be union\nindustries. Otherwise, as Hollywood proves, they will be fully digested by the\npower of capital. Helping publishing workers catch up with their unionized\ncounterparts in this swath of the economy makes a great deal of sense for\neveryone.\n\nThe one part of the book industry that has joined the union wave in earnest is\nbookstores. Some of the biggest independent book stores in the country, like\nthe Strand and Powell\u2019s, have long been unionized \u2014 and now, as the Guardian\nreported this week, workers at Barnes & Noble are accelerating plans to join\nthem. In the past year, six of the company\u2019s six hundred locations have\nunionized, over the bleating objections of the CEO. Four of those stores,\nincluding three in New York City, have joined the Retail Wholesale &\nDepartment Store Union (RWDSU) \u2014 a union inclined to lean into new organizing\ndrives, as evidenced by the great resources it expended trying to win a union\nat the Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama.\n\nThe union effort at Barnes & Noble is proceeding on a store-by-store basis,\naccording to RWDSU communications director Chelsea Connor. The three New York\nCity stores have been in bargaining for seven months, but the company has so\nfar refused to allow them to negotiate a single master contract for all of the\nstores in the city. Connor says the union is in the midst of a \u201cnational\norganizing effort\u201d at Barnes & Noble, though she wouldn\u2019t disclose specific\nplans.\n\nIn any union drive at a national chain, it is easy to imagine that if the\nunion can get enough stores organized, it can use a combination of strikes and\nnegative PR to force the company to bargain a national contract, elevating the\nwork lives of all of the employees at once. Indeed, this is the thing that the\nStarbucks union appears to have accomplished, weathering a storm of union\nbusting to wear the company down and force it to the table. Besides the ample\nefforts of the workers and organizers themselves, the victory at Starbucks was\naided by a friendly Biden administration National Labor Relations Board\n(NLRB), which deluged Starbucks with charges for violating labor laws, and by\nfriendly politicians like Sen. Bernie Sanders, who dragged Starbucks founder\nHoward Schultz in front of Congress to berate him for being a hypocritical\nscumbag.\n\nA company like Barnes & Noble, whose customers are probably more sensitive\nthan average to the idea that they are supporting an exploitative monster, is\nvulnerable to a Starbucks-esque approach. The more stores that the RWDSU can\norganize, the more plausible such a strategy becomes.\n\nGaze at the book industry with optimistic eyes and you will be able to see the\noutlines of a union-fueled alternative to the shoddy and deflating\ncommodification of culture that American businesses specialize in. We can\nunionize the schools that teach people to write, so they can think without\ndebt suffocating them. We can unionize the media outlets where the writers\nhone their craft, so that they don\u2019t have to give up their writing dreams\nbefore it starts. We can unionize the publishing houses so the people who do\nthe actual work of producing the books can share in the prosperity of the\nsuccessful authors (and the always successful corporate managers). We can\nunionize the book stores, so that no one who plays a part in the delivery of\nbooks to readers has to be condemned to a life of genteel poverty. And then we\ncan sell the books to a unionized Hollywood, where unionized screenwriters can\nturn them into movies staffed by unionized actors and directors and crews.\nSounds nice, right? We\u2019re already on the path. It\u2019s just a matter of helping\nour friends in the book industry fill in the gaps.\n\nOr, we can just let artificial intelligence read every book ever written and\nproduce infinite versions of Twilight that can be turned directly into CGI\nmovies overseen by a single paid employee whose job is to send the profits\ndirectly to the limited partners of the private equity firm. The choice is\nours!\n\nRepublished from In These Times.\n\n#### Share this article\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\n#### Contributors\n\nHamilton Nolan is senior writer at Deadspin.\n\n#### Filed Under\n\n  * United States\n\n  * Unions\n\n  * unions\n  * Union Organizing\n  * Publishing\n  * Books\n\n# Sign up for our mailing list\n\nAlready on our list?
