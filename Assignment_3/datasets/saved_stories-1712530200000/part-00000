In fact, fusion\nenergy\u2019s promise of clean, safe, and virtually unlimited energy has driven\nresearchers of many generations toward the realization of this future energy\nsource. However, in recent years, efforts toward commercialization have\nsignificantly accelerated worldwide, which is exemplified by recent national\ninitiatives like the Bold Decadal Vision for Commercial Fusion Energy in the\nU.S. [1] and the UK\u2019s electricity-generating STEP plant that plans to be\ncompleted by 2040 [2]. Further, the private sector is proposing even more\nambitious timelines than the UK government, where 3 out of 4 companies are\nexpecting to achieve fusion power generation during the 2030s [3].\n\nThus arises the following question: is the age-long sarcasm of \u201cfusion is\nalways 30 years away\u201d still valid in 2023? This paper answers this question\nthrough a literature review of researchers' expectations about when fusion\nenergy will be \u201cready\u201d for over the past 40 years.\n\n## Results\n\nFigure 1 summarizes the evolution of the researchers' remarks on the estimated\ntiming of fusion realization published between 1985 and 2022. The screening\nprotocol for literature is described in the \u201cAppendix\u201d. The horizontal axis of\nFig. 1 shows the year of publication, and the vertical axis plots the remarks\nwithin the given paper about the number of years needed before fusion is\nrealized, i.e., the \u201cfusion is X years away\u201d factor.\n\nFig. 1\n\nResearchers\u2019 expectations on fusion realization over the past 40 years. (N.B.\nDrawn by the author based on Tables 1 and 2. JET: Joint European Torus; NIF:\nNational Ignition Facility; JT-60: Japan Torus-60; FIA: Fusion Industry\nAssociation.)\n\nFull size image\n\nThe authors then performed regression analyses of the review result. Here, the\nrealization of fusion was categorized into two phases: the first transmission\nof fusion power to the grid, i.e., the realization of a DEMO plant or\nequivalent, and the introduction of fusion to the commercial market, i.e., the\nrealization of the first commercial plant. Linear regression models, which\nassume constant progress over the years, are shown as dotted lines (the\nConstant Progress Model). The model assuming non-constant progress, regression\nmodels fitted with cubic functions, are drawn as solid lines (the Dynamic\nProgress Model). Regression results are summarized in the \u201cAppendix\u201d as Table\n2.\n\n## Discussions and Conclusion\n\n### Progress Towards Fusion Realization\n\nThe result illustrated in Fig. 1 is insightful. Referring to the Constant\nProgress Model, which assumes constant progress toward fusion realization over\nthe past four decades, the slope of the regression line is \u2212 0.4319 for first\nfusion power generation and \u2212 0.2521 for commercialization. In other terms,\nscientists\u2019 expectations for the first electricity generation plant have\nshortened by 2.5 years every 10 years since 1985; similarly, expectations for\nthe first commercial plant have shortened by 4.3 years every 10 years. This\nindicates that the scientists\u2019 collective expectation for fusion realization\nhas progressed over the last four decades, as opposed to widespread cynicism.\n\nA further intriguing trend becomes apparent under the Dynamic Progress Model,\nwhich assumes a dynamic change in expectations toward fusion. Observing the\nsolid lines in Fig. 1, it is clear that the expectations for fusion energy\nwent downhill from 1985 until 2000s, and then improved afterward. This is a\nquantitative indication that scientists were optimistic about the realization\nof fusion until the 1980s, but became pessimistic from the 1990s to the 2000s,\nand then their confidence returned after the 2010s. The peak of the pessimism\nwas in 2006, with \u201cfusion being 29.2 years away\u201d for demonstration, and in\n2001, with \u201cfusion being 53.0 years away\u201d for commercialization.\n\n### Accelerated Expectations for Fusion\n\nComparing the R-squared values of the two models (Table 2), it is clear that\nthe Dynamic Progress Model fits the evolution of the expectations for fusion\nbetter than the Constant Progress Model. This implies that the change in the\nexpectation for fusion has, in fact, not been constant; rather, it has been\naccelerated since the 2010s.\n\nWhat caused these dynamic changes in expectations? Comparing the timelines of\nthe key events in the fusion community and the shifts in expectations, it\nwould seem that the major scientific achievements in the late 90 s (including\nthe successful JET and JT-60 experiments) created the turning point for the\nexpectations for commercialization. Then, milestone achievements of the public\nprograms (including NIF and ITER) as well as the advent of the private sector\naround the year 2010 coincided with the turning point in the expectation for\nthe first fusion power generation.\n\nIt would be difficult to objectively conclude if private enterprises (or the\npublic programs, for that matter) contributed to the accelerated progress or\nif they are simply benefitting from this trend from this result alone.\nPersonally, judging from Fig. 1, the author would like to believe that private\ncompanies are both contributors and beneficiaries of this trend. In the end,\nthe turning in expectations did happen before the advent of the private\nsector; at the same time, there would be no denying that the accelerated\nexpectations for fusion around the year 2020 owe significantly to the private\nsector.\n\n### Limitations\n\nBefore moving into conclusions, it should be noted there are some limitations\nto the study. The most notable limitation of this review is that, due to the\nambiguous nature of the review criteria, the authors could not design a\nsystematic review process. As a result, the authors could not ensure that\nevery published literature that mentions the timing of fusion realization is\nincluded in this study. Further, the \u201cfusion is X years away\u201d statements are\noften subject to biases and opinion of the scientists, rather than scientific\nassessments. Notwithstanding, the authors made every effort to be\ncomprehensive and impartial in their screening process as outlined in\n\u201cAppendix\u201d, and the extracted literature (N = 45) was sufficient to produce\nstatistically significant regression models. As a result, the authors believe\nthat the result is sufficient to discuss the general trend of the scientists'\nexpectations of fusion energy over the past four decades.\n\n## How Many Years Away is Fusion?\n\nIn conclusion, according to the collective remarks by scientists, the popular\nphrase \u201cfusion is always 30 years away\u201d is proven wrong, technically speaking.\nTo be precise, we should now say \u201cfusion was said to be 19.3 years away 30\nyears ago; it was 28.3 years away 20 years ago; 27.8 years away 10 years ago.\u201d\nAnd now, scientists believe fusion energy is only 17.8 years away. So there is\na progress, and it is accelerating toward the realization of this ultimate\nclean energy.\n\n## References\n\n  1.

Web of\nScience, Scopus, and Google Scholar were used as search engines for locating\neligible articles. The keywords that were used in the search were \u201cfusion\nenergy,\u201d \u201cnuclear fusion,\u201d and \u201cfusion power.\u201d The phrases that were used to\nsearch the articles used a combination of Boolean operators AND/OR/IN with\nEnglish phrases and words such as \u201cyears away,\u201d \u201chow many years,\u201d \u201calways\nyears,\u201d \u201crealization,\u201d \u201cprogress,\u201d \u201cbreakthrough,\u201d \u201crealistic,\u201d and\n\u201cfeasible.\u201d While priority was given to peer-reviewed articles published in\nacademic journals, gray literature, such as technical reports, government\ndocuments, conference papers, editorial letters, and perspectives, were also\ncited in this study, as these articles also reflect the sentiments of the\npublished era. Other than database search, a snowballing procedure was also\nused to identify potential sources. The screening process began with title\nscreening, followed by abstract and full-text screening resulting in 45\narticles tabulated in Table 1.\n\nThen the authors conducted a manual full-text search to identify the key\nquotations regarding the timing of fusion realization to extract the \u201cX years\naway\u201d factors. One important caveat of this full-text search is that, for this\nstudy, the authors presumed that technical assessment, educated guesses, and\nquotations were all reflective of the sentiment of the scientists at the time.\nThis presumption was applied even for quotations from previous works, as\nauthors of the paper can arbitrarily cite previous works that state \u201cfusion is\n30/40/50 years away.\u201d As such, it would be reasonable to assume that the cited\nnumber would reflect the authors\u2019 own sentiment on the expectation of fusion\nrealization. When the literature estimates the timing of fusion realization\nwith a range, the median value for the expected range was used for regression.\nWhen the article does not specifically mention if the prediction is for the\ndemonstration or for the commercialization, the authors manually determined\nthe category carefully from the context of the remark. The key quotations,\nalong with the \u201cX years away\u201d factors, are tabulated in Table 1. Regression\nresults are summarized in Table 2.\n\nTable 1 Tabulated list of screened literature with key quotations\n\nFull size table\n\nTable 2 Regression results for scientists' expectations on fusion realization,\nbased on Table 1\n\nFull size table\n\n## Rights and permissions\n\nOpen Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\nInternational License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate\ncredit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the\nCreative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.
