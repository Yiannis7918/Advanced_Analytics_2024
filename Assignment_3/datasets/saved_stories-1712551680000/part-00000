million\u2014but in the cryptocurrency's early\ndays, one hacker was able to create 184 billion Bitcoin out of thin air.\n\nBy Robert Stevens\n\nAug 26, 2020Aug 26, 2020\n\n4 min read\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 by pseudonymous inventor Satoshi Nakamoto (Image:\nShutterstock)\n\nCreate an account to save your articles.\n\n#### In brief\n\n  * In August 2010, someone exploited a flaw in Bitcoin\u2019s code to create 184 billion Bitcoin.\n  * The bug was quickly corrected by Bitcoin\u2019s anonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.\n  * The person behind the \"value overflow incident\"

We\u2019re not too far off\u2014around 18\nand a half million Bitcoin are already in circulation. But on the 15th of\nAugust, 2010, that limit was destroyed by one person who managed to exploit a\nflaw to produce 184 billion Bitcoin.\n\nLet\u2019s set the scene: back in 2010, BitcoinBitcoin peaked at around $0.3\u2014so\nlow, in fact, that in May that year someone spent 10,000 Bitcoin buying a\nsingle pizza, now worth over $110 million.\n\n## Bitcoin Pizza Day 2020: How two Papa John's pies became famous\n\nToday, the whole crypto community is celebrating the 10th anniversary of\nBitcoin Pizza Day. Exactly ten years ago, Laszlo Hanyecz, a programmer from\nFlorida who also contributed to Bitcoin's source code in the past, made the\nfirst documented purchase of physical goods with Bitcoin.

Enter block 74,638, the fateful block that created\n184,467,440,737.09551616 Bitcoin, with two addresses receiving just over 92\nbillion Bitcoin each\u201492,233,720,368, to be specific.\n\nThe errant transaction in Bitcoin block 74,638 (Image: Bitcoin Talk)\n\nThe anomaly was quickly spotted on the Bitcoin Talk forum by Jeff Garzik, a\nBitcoin developer who today is the CEO of Bloq. The issue was termed an\n\u201coverflow bug\u201d; the code for checking Bitcoin transactions didn't work if\noutputs were large enough that they overflowed when summed.\n\nThe bug that caused the \"value overflow incident\" was corrected very quickly.\nIt took just five hours before a \u201csoft fork\u201d was rolled out, which reset the\nBitcoin blockchain to before the bugged block and included code to reject\noutput value overflow transactions.\n\n## $500,000 Bitcoin stash from Satoshi era just moved\n\nA long term Bitcoin hodler\u2014or someone who just found an old wallet\u2014has moved a\nlarge amount of Bitcoin, mined during the network's earliest days. Today, 50\nBitcoin, worth $500,000 today, was moved, and split up into two addresses in\none transaction. As pointed out by Coindesk reporter Zack Voell, the coin was\nmined in block 3,654\u2014and hadn't moved since then. It's not every day you see\ncoins from the 3000s block heights moving around. https://t.co/ozHpq4m1Up\npic.twitter.com/jkRhf7Kcme \u2014 Zack Voe...\n\nNewsTechnology\n\n4 min read\n\nTim CopelandMay 20, 2020May 20, 2020\n\nCreate an account to save your articles.\n\nA soft fork is a blockchain update. Since the Bitcoin community forked the\nstate of the blockchain before the 184 billion Bitcoin was mined, that means\nthat some blocks that were previously valid were turned into invalid blocks,\nremoving them from the blockchain and restoring it to an earlier state.\n\nThe fork erased all transactions and mining that had been recorded on blocks\nthat were produced after the bugged block. It also disposed of the 184 billion\nbugged Bitcoin. The update, Bitcoin patch 0.3.10, was implemented by Bitcoin\u2019s\npseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto himself (or herself, or themselves).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n## How many Bitcoin does its inventor Satoshi Nakamoto still own?\n\nThe enigmatic creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, was the first person to\nmine the cryptocurrency\u2014at a time when each block mined yielded a 50 BTC\nreward. Unlike today's Bitcoin miners, Satoshi didn't split these rewards with\npotentially thousands of other mining pool users, and instead benefitted from\nthe entire reward himself. At the time Bitcoin had practically zero value;\ntoday, the price of Bitcoin is at the mid-end of the five-figure dollar range.\nBetween January and July 2009, Satoshi...\n\nNewsTechnology\n\n4 min read\n\nDaniel PhillipsJan 3, 2021Jan 3, 2021\n\nCreate an account to save your articles.\n\nThe rapid implementation of the patch was vital in keeping Bitcoin a viable\ncryptocurrency. 184 billion Bitcoin would have devalued the currency\ncompletely, leaving it at the mercy of the person holding the newly-minted\nBitcoin. Even if the breach happened today, the amount of bugged Bitcoin would\ncompletely dwarf the current supply of the cryptocurrency, making any Bitcoin\nworthless.\n\n> 10 years ago a bug was exploited to create 184 billion BTC. Due to the\n> ability to easily audit the supply it was noticed quickly; bug was patched\n> in 5 hours.\n>\n> Several protocols have since suffered inflation bugs that went unnoticed for\n> months.\n>\n> Independent auditability has value.\n>\n> \u2014 Jameson Lopp (@lopp) August 14, 2020\n\nBitcoin also benefited from this exploit being patched close to its inception,\nsince taking the Bitcoin network offline could be done without significant\nconsequences.\n\nToday, such a disruption would cause widespread chaos; trading would be\nheavily disrupted and any purchases that were made using Bitcoin would have\nbeen canceled. The very fact that a bug could enable the 21 million Bitcoin\nlimit to be breached would also create shockwaves in the crypto community,\nlikely causing the price of Bitcoin to collapse and fatally undermining\nconfidence in the cryptocurrency.\n\n## What happened to Bitcoin\u2019s price?\n\nThe exploit and subsequent soft fork didn\u2019t dent the price of Bitcoin. Indeed,\nBitcoin actually experienced a surge over 2010; its price increased by over\n300% between the day of the patch and the end of the year (from $0.07 to\n$0.30). That Satoshi himself intervened, and did so so quickly, showed that\nBitcoin was not as easily hackable as some might have assumed and built\nconfidence in a concept which up to that point remained untested.\n\nBTC\n\n+146.86%$69,042.38\n\n24H7D1M1YMAX\n\nPrice data by\n\nBTC price\n\nTo this day, the person behind the exploit remains unknown, and due to the\nanonymous nature of the blockchain there is no way to trace them. Despite\ntheir anonymity, they are still a significant individual in the history of\nblockchain\u2014quite possibly the first ever blockchain hacker.\n\n### Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.\n\nIPFSIPFS\n\n### Recommended News\n\n  * ## BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF Gets Backing From Wall Street Titan Goldman Sachs\n\nSeveral major U.S. banks have been added as partners to BlackRock\u2019s spot\nBitcoin ETF since the product went live in January, including a prominent Wall\nStreet titan that has previously derided crypto for years.
