Understanding the model is useful not only for predicting\ngrowth, but because understanding the foundational drivers of growth allows us\nto take smarter actions to create growth in our own companies.\n\n## Dispelling \u201cexponential\u201d\n\nTo evaluate whether hypergrowth is properly described as \u201cexponential,\u201d let\u2019s\nrecall what that word means. Here\u2019s an exponential curve (like y=2x), compared\nto a quadratic one (like y=x2):\n\nIn exponential growth, values grow by a multiple. For example: In year 1 you\ngrow 10, in year 2 by 100, in year 3 by 1000\u2014each time the amount of growth is\nmultiplied by ten. The compounding effect of multiplication causes the numbers\nto grow slowly initially, then skyrocket. The compounding effect gets\njournalists and VCs justifiably excited.\n\n> Compound interest is the most powerful force in the universe. \u2014Albert\n> Einstein\n\nIn quadratic growth, values grow by a adding a constant amount more each time-\ninterval, rather than multiplying a constant amount more each time-interval.\nIn the same example, growing in year 1 by 10, then in year 2 by 20, in year 3\nby 30:\n\nSuccessive values (in blue) are increasing more and more (in green). The green\ndifferences are increasing linearly: 10, 20, 30.\n\nGrowth is still accelerating, so the blue curve slopes upwards, but gently\ncompared to exponential growth.\n\nWith these patterns in mind, let\u2019s examine real-world data, and see whether\n\u201cexponential\u201d is the right model.\n\nFacebook is the definition of hypergrowth\u2014getting to $50B in revenue faster\nthan any company in history. The product is \u201cviral\u201d\u2014friends bring other\nfriends\u2014which theoretically leads to \u201cexponential growth.\u201d But Facebook didn\u2019t\ngrow exponentially in the number of monthly active users:\n\nEssentially linear for nearly twenty years, only exponential in the first four\nyears.\n\nSlack was the fastest-growing enterprise software company ever, going from $0\nto $10M ARR in their first 10 months, and 0 to 10,000,000 active users in just\nfive years. It\u2019s also a \u201cviral\u201d product\u2014organizations invite their members,\nwho then create their own Slack-groups and invite others. So surely Slack has\nexponential growth?\n\nSlack\u2019s own data shows initial quadratic growth, followed by years of linear\ngrowth.\n\nIf you compare Slack\u2019s growth with Microsoft Team\u2019s growth, do you still think\nSlack\u2019s growth is \u201cexponential?\u201d\n\nsource\n\nDropbox was another \u201chypergrowth\u201d company, achieving 100,000,000 registered\nusers five years after being founded in 2007, but it wasn\u2019t exponential,\nneither in freemium users nor in revenue, early nor later in life.\n\nsource\n\nEarly in life, Dropbox registered users grows non-exponentially, nearly\nexactly 100M per year\n\nsource\n\nLater in life, Dropbox revenue grows linearly, and slows down\n\nTrello grew fast too, getting to 10,000,000 registered users in three years.\nBut not exponentially:\n\nsource\n\nLyft grew in part due to \u201cnetwork effects\u201d according to their S1, but this\nchart they presented shows that active rider growth isn\u2019t exponential:\n\nHubspot\u2019s revenue curve is astonishingly consistent, despite hitting multiple\ninflection points^1 in their business:\n\n> ^1 e.g. launching new business models like selling through agencies instead\n> of only directly, launching new product lines like sales CRM on top of\n> marketing automation tools, and scaling the number of customers and\n> employees by 10x\n\nsource\n\nAnalyzing this last example, we arrive at a new, non-exponential model.\n\n## Hypergrowth is quadratic\n\nThe language we use can determine the thoughts we have.\n\nThe Hubspot slide says \u201c41% CAGR.\u201d \u201cCAGR\u201d means annualized growth rate.\nThey\u2019re saying that if you start with the first number on the slide, then from\nthere plot growing 41% per each year, compounding each year upon the previous,\nfor seven years, you would arrive at the last number on the slide. This is\nexactly the definition of \u201cexponential\u201d\u2014multiplying by a number repeatedly. In\ngeneral when you use \u201cCAGR\u201d or \u201cpercentage growth\u201d as a metric, you are\nimplicitly saying \u201cThis is an exponential process.\u201d\n\nBut Hubspot didn\u2019t grow by 41% every year; in this timeframe, it started at\n60% and ended around 30%:\n\nExponential curves have a constant year-over-year growth rate, therefore this\nis not exponential growth.\n\nIf instead we examine growth in absolute dollars, rather than in percent, a\npattern emerges. In the first set of four quarters on this report, they grew\n$17M. The next set grew $23M. Then $28M. Then $34M. Each year $5-7M more than\nthe previous. This is the definition of a quadratic\u2014adding an amount that\nincreases by a constant amount each period, not multiplying.\n\nCharting these year-over-year revenue differences in absolute dollars rather\nthan in percent, it\u2019s clear that indeed the changes were almost completely\nlinear for years, then suddenly changed in 2020^2 to a new (but still linear)\nrate:\n\n> ^2 Coinciding with the launch of a new product: Hubspot CMS Hub.\n\nIt is therefore mathematically inevitable that plotting a quadratic curve\n(rather than exponential) on top of Hubspot\u2019s revenue data will be a perfect\nfit:\n\nWhen you said \u201cbest-fit,\u201d you weren\u2019t kidding!\n\nMy thesis is that High-growth^3 companies grow quadratically, not\nexponentially.\n\n> ^3 My guess is low-growth companies are similar, but data are more easily\n> available for the runaway-growth companies who publicly flaunt their\n> success.\n\nThe consequence of this conclusion is important for operators and analysis and\ninvestors. These are all people trying to understand\u2014and possibly\nchange\u2014growth drivers. Getting the right language, and the right model, will\nlead to right analysis, and right action.\n\n\u261e If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! \u261c\n\n## Why marketing-driven products grow quadratically: A first-principles\nexplanation\n\nIt\u2019s not enough to draw best-fit lines on top of PowerPoint slides. We have to\nexplain why this model makes sense, which in turn will create a better\nunderstanding of the growth drivers in our own companies.\n\nWe\u2019ve been taking a macro view of growth, looking at multi-year trajectories.\nNow we\u2019ll peer into the microscope instead of the telescope, and consider how\ngrowth arises from a single marketing campaign.\n\n### The life of a marketing campaign\n\nIn my experience, marketing campaigns follow this pattern:\n\nAt the foot of the curve, we\u2019ve launched a new campaign, but it\u2019s ineffective;\nwe haven\u2019t figured out the best design and messaging and calls-to-action for\nthis new medium and audience. Sometimes we never figure it out, and abandon\nthe effort^4.\n\n> ^4 It\u2019s hard to distinguish (a) our failure to build effective copy and\n> conversion funnels from (b) channels that are fundamentally a bad fit for\n> our market or product. This uncertainty, together with the rapid evolution\n> of digital marketing, suggests that we should retry campaigns in previously-\n> failed channels every few years.\n\nBut in the case that we unlock the secret of efficacy, the campaign rapidly\nreaches a natural level of contribution; in this example, a number of \u201csales\nper week.\u201d The specific level depends on many things: ad inventory, our\nbudget, audience-receptivity, and the consonance between the audience and our\ntarget market.\n\nNext we enter the optimization phase. We A/B Test our way to incrementally\nbetter results. Also we enjoy the result of multiple exposures\u2014most people\nneed to see the ad more than once before they act.\n\nFinally we enter a phase of decline. There are various causes, all\ninstructive:\n\n  * The audience saturates. Everyone in the channel has seen the ad more times than is required to act; it\u2019s now falling on deaf ears. Even if the audience is growing, the number of new people is small compared to the number of people that were new-to-us when we began the campaign.\n  * The channel declines. A media site that was popular loses readers through over-monetization. An event that was well-attended loses favor. A newsletter that was frequent and insightful becomes less frequent or other writers take over. A podcast moves to a closed platform and loses many listeners.\n  * The auction becomes uneconomical. For auction-based systems like Google and Facebook advertisements, or other zero-sum programs like affiliates or limited-inventory spots on newsletters or podcasts, the winner is the one who will pay the most. What is cost-effective for one bidder will be laughably overpriced for another, due to better conversion rates, higher revenue per customer, higher profitability per customer, or due to categorization as a \u201closs leader\u201d or other way of ascribing value beyond immediate pay-back.\n\nThis curve leads to actionable ideas for managing marketing (given at the end\nof this article), but also forms my central thesis about how all sorts of\ngrowth works at companies. So I\u2019m giving it a name:\n\n### How the idealized marketing campaign converts to growth\n\nThe model above shows the number of sales per week the campaign contributes.\nTo understand how this looks in terms of revenue growth, let us suppose a\nsimple business model in which all sales are for a recurring revenue product\ngenerating $10 per month, with a 1% per month cancellation rate. How will\nrevenue grow over time?\n\nGrowth initially accelerates as the campaign is solved, then grows roughly\nlinearly as the campaign is optimized, and then starts sagging (although still\ngrowing!) as the campaign declines, and as the now-sizable customer base\nproduces a non-trivial number of cancellations.\n\n### The layer-cake of quadratic growth\n\nMarketing departments don\u2019t stop at a single campaign. They add new ones. Some\nare bigger than others, some can be optimized more than others, some decline\nsooner than others, some decline more precipitously than others.\n\nSo, let\u2019s model that: A variety of Elephant Curves, with differing parameters,\nbeginning at different times, stacking the revenue-contribution of each to\narrive at overall revenue growth for the company.\n\nLayered campaigns create a \u201cwavy quadratic.\u201d\n\nScan your eye across the top of this kaleidoscopic cake, and you trace a wavy\nquadratic. This makes sense mathematically, because each campaign is\nessentially linear after it gets going, even if it sags during decline.\n\u201cAdding more linear things over time\u201d is the definition of a quadratic.\n\nThe reason it\u2019s \u201cwavy,\u201d is that when we unlock a new campaign we get a burst\nof growth. Do real-life revenue curves exhibit this waviness? Maybe so; here\u2019s\nanother slide from the Hubspot deck:\n\nsource\n\nHubspot didn\u2019t just add new marketing channels, however, but also layered on\nnew geographies and new products. Do those activities have the same effect as\nmarketing campaigns?\n\n### Multiple product lines at marketing-driven companies: Still quadratic\n\nSo far we\u2019ve assumed a single product, driven by marketing campaigns. High-\ngrowth companies who want to continue growing quickly after their first\nproduct reaches scale, must launch new products into new markets.\n\nIs the Elephant Curve also the shape of an entire product line? After all,\nproducts often have an initial slow-growth period (because only cutting-edge\nearly adopters are eager to pay to \u201cbe first\u201d with bugs and missing features),\nfollowed by a faster expansion period, then reach some sort of natural\nceiling, and possibly enter a period of decline (as the market evolves or\ncompetition overwhelms).\n\nIndeed, this is what we see with many products, especially those that are\nmarketing-driven, and without recurring-revenue. iPod sales, for example, are\na perfect match:\n\nsource\n\nIt should therefore be unsurprising when we look at the overall revenue chart\nfor Apple, and once again see quadratic growth on the top-line, admittedly\nwith a special one-time bump for the unprecedented^5 success of the iPhone:\n\n> ^5 It is rare for a second product to dramatically outpace the first; even\n> juggernauts like Google, Amazon, and Facebook never achieved that.\n\nsource\n\nEach product is in a different phase of its lifecycle: The iPod declined to\nzero, the iPad is still declining; Macs are teetering but essentially flat;\niPhones and software services are still increasing.\n\n### The quadratic explanation for \u201cgrowth decay\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s well-known that growth\u2014as a percentage\u2014naturally declines with scale,\neven when there\u2019s nothing wrong with the company.\n\nThis law of nature has been given a name: Growth Decay (or sometimes Growth\nPersistence). Because of the traditional insistence of talking about growth as\na percentage, the concept is articulated this way: If a company grew X% last\nyear, it\u2019s likely to grow a bit less than X% this year. With this formulation,\nthe question becomes: How much less?\n\nThe data give us the answer of 85%, although with R2=0.51, this is a tendency\nbut far from a law:\n\nsource\n\nWith our new appreciation that growth isn\u2019t exponential, and therefore\n\u201cpercentage\u201d might be the wrong way to characterize growth, we could ask what\ncurve would best model the idea of Growth Decay? Specifically, let\u2019s plot\nrevenue for an initially-fast-growing company that is subject to the principle\nof Growth Decay:\n\nThe first leg of the curve is quadratic. While mathematically not identical,\nthe best-fit quadratic curve for this data has a staggering R2=0.999.\n\nThis is yet another signal that quadratic growth is the correct model.\n\n\u261e If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! \u261c\n\n## Beyond marketing campaigns: \u201cViral\u201d and other forms of \u201cexponential\u201d growth\n\nBut some products really do grow exponentially. In theory.\n\n> In theory, theory and practice are the same. In practice, they\u2019re not.\n> \u2014Benjamin Brewster\n\nSome products don\u2019t grow proportionally with marketing and sales, but instead\nself-propel with a mechanism that theoretically ought be exponential. There\nare at least three ways for this to happen:\n\n  1. Virality. When each user invites on average another a users, then each of those a new users bring in another a new users, so we end up with a2 more. Then each of those brings in another a which yields a3 . Then a4 and so on; this is the definition of exponential growth. Biological viruses grow exponentially for a similar reason, justifying the label.\n\nExamples: social media, chat clients, peer-to-peer payment platforms,\nmassively-multi-player games, fantasy sports leagues\n\n2\\. Word-of-Mouth. All products have some word-of-mouth component, but here\nwe\u2019re referring to products that are primarily driven this way; this creates a\ngrowth process that is similar to viral. Typically the mechanism of \u201ctelling\nothers\u201d is built into the product, rather than bolted on by marketing or\ngenerated by goodwill. The difference between \u201cword-of-mouth\u201d and \u201cviral,\u201d is\nthat viral products are unusable unless you invite others to become users\n(thus exponential growth is enforced) whereas word-of-mouth products encourage\nsharing. Thus chat clients are viral because without inviting others you can\u2019t\nchat, whereas Wordle^6 was word-of-mouth, because you play the game alone, but\nare encouraged to share results on Twitter, which in turn brings in new users.\n\n> ^6 Wordle exploded from 90 players in November 2021, to 300,000 in December,\n> to 2,000,000 in January, when it was bought by the New York Times.\n\nExamples: gamified products that generate significant sharing (self-\nimprovement, game-results), consumer-to-consumer marketplaces where being a\nbuyer plants the idea of becoming a seller (eBay, Airbnb, Uber); organizations\nwith a cause that creates on-going buzz (brazenly unique cultures, a\npassionate higher purpose, something people feel is linked to their personal\nidentity).\n\n3\\. Hot Trend. Products that \u201ceveryone\u201d (in some well-defined market) is going\nto buy. For smartphones, that might be half the population of the world. For\ninternet search, that might be 100% of the online world. For backend\nmanagement systems for large hospital chains, that could be 1000 potential\ncustomers. These products hit \u201ctipping points\u201d where \u201csuddenly everyone buys\nit.\u201d Even if, like internet search, the product has no explicitly viral nor\nword-of-mouth component\u2014when you search on Google, you don\u2019t \u201cinvite friends\u201d\nto also search on Google\u2014the ubiquity and inevitability of the trend leads to\nan explosion of users.\n\nExamples: word-processing, spreadsheets, broadband internet, the smartphone,\nthe shifts to cloud computing and online shopping, major media delivery\nplatforms of radio, TV, DVD, and video streaming,\n\n### Logistic growth: Nearly the right model for virality\n\nProducts cannot grow forever, for the obvious reason that markets are finite.\nThe Facebook virus spread to billions of people, but not infinite. Smartphones\nhave been purchased by billions of people, but not infinite.\n\nTherefore, even if \u201cexponential\u201d is the correct model for the core growth\nmechanism of the product, it nevertheless cannot continue growing\nexponentially because it runs out of market. Furthermore, markets tend to have\nso-called \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d\u2014customers who are more eager to buy\u2014so although\nthe virus spreads exponentially through these easy-pickings, it runs into the\nmajority of people who will buy, but maybe later, maybe after more of their\nfriends or competitors are using it, maybe if it\u2019s less expensive, maybe once\nit has more features, maybe once it supports integration with specific other\nsoftware, and all manner of other excuses. The virus has more trouble\ninfecting these high-strung fruits, so growth slows.\n\nThis suggests a curve that starts exponentially, but then slows as it runs\ninto the soft back-pressure of more demanding customers, and finally flattens\nout completely as it runs into the hard limit of the size of the addressable\nmarket.\n\nBiologists have already done the work for us, because this is the correct\nmodel not just for viral products, but biological viruses infecting a\npopulation\u2014akin to product types 1 and 2 above. Intriguingly, this is also the\ncorrect model^7 for the diffusion of a gas across a membrane\u2014akin to product\ntype 3. The mathematical model for all of these processes is the logistic\ncurve:\n\n> ^7 The similarity is that in both cases you have a sudden demand that enters\n> into a new space, but which slows and eventually stops as the new space\n> becomes saturated.\n\nThe logistic curve is exponential in the early days when it is far away from\nits natural limit. As the product (or gas or virus) gets to around 25% market\npenetration (or infections or saturation), the curve flattens into linear\ngrowth, in a tension between the exponential force of growth, countered by\nfewer and more demanding remaining targets. Finally it levels out at what is\ncalled the \u201ccarrying capacity\u201d\u2014the fully-saturated market.\n\nThe logistic curve is evident in the real world, in all three product types:\n\nsource\n\nTwitter is a type 1 \u201cViral\u201d product that follows the logistic model\n\nsource\n\nPinterest is a type 1 \u201cViral\u201d product that follows the logistic model\n\nsource\n\neBay is a type 2 \u201cWord-of-mouth\u201d in the number of buyers, following the\nlogistic model (though also sagging towards the end, reminiscent of the\nElephant Curve)\n\neBay also follows the logistic model in the number of sellers (with even more\npronounced sagging)\n\nsource\n\nSmartphones are a type 3 \u201cHot Trend\u201d that follows the logistic model all the\nway to saturation\n\nsource\n\nSmartphone usage, separate from smartphone sales, is also logistic. Many\npundits predicted this percentage would grow nearly without bound; in fact it\nsaturated at 55%.\n\nThe internet is a type 3 \u201cHot Trend\u201d product with a near-exact logistic shape;\nat 66% global penetration, it hasn\u2019t reached carrying-capacity, but it\u2019s been\nin its linear mode for many years, and fell off the exponential path sooner\nthan you might have expected\n\n### Stacking logistic growth: The quadratic reappears\n\nMarketing-driven products demonstrated quadratic growth, especially once\nElephant-shaped campaigns and products were stacked. How does this differ with\nlogistic growth?\n\nAs already pointed out, logistic growth is similar to the Elephant Curve. The\n\u201chigh growth\u201d portion of a marketing campaign might in fact be logistic; a\nproduct might extend that period into years rather than weeks, and the\nabsolute magnitude of the result might be many times larger.\n\nIf this idea is correct, we ought to see viral-like products exhibit a similar\ncurve to the iPod curve\u2014i.e. a product with initially-exponential growth, then\na flattening, perhaps with some small growth, then on a long-enough timeline,\na decline. An Elephant with a more stretched-out trunk.\n\nThe Facebook Messenger product appears to exhibit at least the first half of\nthe logistic curve:\n\nsource\n\nFurthermore, this curve is actually a sum of US growth and outside-US growth.\nLooking only inside the US, Facebook Messenger is further along the curve,\npast the linear mid-section and already leveling out near some carrying-\ncapacity:\n\nThe same thing happens with Facebook DAUs and MAUs^8. DAUs in the United\nStates and Canada are logistical and have already topped-out at an apparent\nnatural carrying-capacity of 185 million:\n\n> ^8 Daily Active Users, Monthly Active Users\n\nsource\n\nBreaking out MAUs by all geographies reveals that top-line growth of users is\nan aggregate of some geographies essentially not growing at all (late in the\ncurve), while others are still growing, albeit also linearly (middle of the\ncurve):\n\nsource\n\nThe result of these individual effects of different products, released at\ndifferent times, in different geographies, each with a \u201cmarketing campaign\u201d\nstyle growth curve, is that it adds up to linear growth:\n\nExponential growth for the first few years crashes down into linear growth for\nnearly twenty years, from large-scale logistic-shaped products and geographies\n\nDoes this conform to the Elephant Curve? Is this really still essentially\nquadratic? The answer is clear when we plot the same data, this time measuring\nthe year-over-year change in MAUs. Not as a percentage, but as numbers:\n\nFacebook MAU growth is indeed an Elephant Curve: Logistic at first, then\nflat(ish), then starting to decline.\n\nWhy do we keep seeing this pattern, even at the scale of Facebook, one of the\nmost \u201cviral\u201d products of all time? Because mathematically, things that look\nlike an Elephant Curve, even if the logistic \u201ctrunk\u201d is elongated over time,\nare linear for nearly their entire lifetimes. Everywhere except the very\nbeginning. Adding up linear things definitionally creates a quadratic.\n\nAs a striking example of this claim\u2014that multiple, various Elephant Curves\nresult in quadratic growth in the real world\u2014consider the detail behind the\nearlier chart of Global Internet Users over time, a type 3 product. Every\ncountry has grown logistically, at a variety of starting-times, diffusion\nrates, and carrying capacities, yet the aggregate is quadratic:\n\nsource\n\n(Click to Enlarge)\n\nThirty years of varied logistic growth adds up to quadratic growth\n\nTo be certain the graph at the bottom (which is the same data as the chart\nshown earlier) is specifically quadratic, we chart the absolute difference in\nonline population year by year. In a quadratic, these differences should grow\nlinearly, i.e. each year adding a constant amount more than the previous year\nadded. Which is indeed what we find, as precisely as we could expect from data\nin the messy real-world:\n\nBringing it back down to the scale of a single company, consider Netflix,\nanother type 3 product. While their overall growth accelerates, under the hood\nwe can see the US is was already in a phase of slow-growth by 2014, with\noutside-US is taking up the slack through 2019:\n\nsource\n\nA quadratic top-line, created by two roughly-linear geographies\n\nIf we chart the changes in subscribers, rather than totals, it\u2019s even more\nclear that growth in the US has been in the declining phase of the Elephant\nCurve for a while, with outside-US is growing linearly:\n\nsource\n\nAnd then, fast-forwarding to 2023, looking at total, global subscribers, we\nsee that growth slowed outside of the US as well, and the familiar Elephant\nCurve returns in its entirety:\n\nsource\n\n### Logistic growth with a varying carrying capacity: Start with market-share\n\nSuppose you\u2019re Facebook, and you\u2019ve saturated many markets. You might be at\ncarrying-capacity for those markets, but more people are still coming online.\nThe markets are growing, so your carrying-capacity is growing, so you should\nstill be able to grow too.\n\nIndeed, recalling the charts above, Facebook\u2019s current MAU growth rate, and\nthat of global Internet users, both are currently hovering around 7% per year.\nWhich isn\u2019t a coincidence.\n\nLet\u2019s plot Facebook\u2019s MAUs as a percentage of people online\u2014their market\nshare.\n\nThe Elephant Curve strikes again\n\nFinally we have the complete answer to why Facebook\u2019s growth appears so\n\u201clinear,\u201d when the theory expects an Elephant Curve. When you examine growth\nrelative to market size it is an Elephant, complete with logistic trunk,\noptimized back, and declining rump (even despite a COVID bump).\n\nThis is why at-scale companies are willing to spend billions of dollars\nincreasing the size of the market\u2014it\u2019s one of the few ways to create growth\nother than raising prices. So Google spent billions on Loon\u2014a subsidized\nservice to bring low-cost internet to remote areas of the world. Its problem-\nstatement is the first text on its website: \u201cBillions of people across the\nglobe still don\u2019t have reliable, affordable access to the internet.\u201d Or,\nputting it another way, \u201cWifi balloons are a kooky idea but how else are we\ngoing to increase the carrying-capacity of the \u2018global internet user\u2019 Elephant\nCurve?\u201d\n\nOr Facebook with its \u201cFree Basics\u201d system that (in their words) \u201cHelps people\ndiscover the relevance and benefits of connectivity with free access to basic\nonline services.\u201d Except actually it\u2019s only a few, hand-curated websites, all\nof which just happen to be western consumer products companies that are large\nFacebook advertisers, and the only available social network just happens to be\nFacebook. And there\u2019s no email, so I hope you like Facebook Messenger. In\nother words, a digital colonialism whose purpose is to increase the carrying\ncapacity of Facebook MAUs and the advertising that goes with it.\n\nElephant Curves are more visible when we plot growth as market share, because\nthis incorporates the idea that carrying-capacity of the underlying market can\nitself be a moving target.\n\n### Logistic growth with a varying unit revenue\n\nWe\u2019ve largely been analyzing users rather than revenue, and for good reason:\nThe lifeblood of any product is people who use it, regardless how much money\nit can extract in the process.\n\nHowever, when we turn to revenue, we find that curves can become perkier.\nFacebook\u2019s user growth might be linear, but could it be that revenue is\nexponential? It\u2019s certainly not linear:\n\nsource\n\nWe already know Facebook\u2019s user growth is linear, so the missing piece is\nFacebook\u2019s revenue per user:\n\nLogistic or Elephant yet again\n\nPerhaps by now we\u2019re not shocked to see the Elephant Curve once again. And we\nalso know how the rest of the story goes: Because MAUs are Elephantine (which\nmeans mostly linear), and revenue-per-user is Elephantine (which means mostly\nlinear), when you multiply them you get a quadratic, not an exponential, and\nthat\u2019s what we see in Facebook\u2019s overall revenue growth.\n\n\u261e If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! \u261c\n\n## Actionable conclusions\n\nWhen we seek out the Elephant Curve in our marketing channels, product lines,\ngeographies, and verticals, not just in its hopefully-explosive initial phase,\nbut its phases of optimization and decline, we can proactively look for these\nphases, and take action.\n\n### Model by component\n\nOur final discussion on the value of analyzing components of growth separate\nleads to a prescription for analyzing growth.\n\n  1. Estimate the growth curve for the entire market. Expect to be Elephantine (or simply logistic, in the case of trends that you can reasonably assume will not decline in the forecasted future, like global Internet use or smartphone use).\n  2. Estimate the product market-share curve. Expect to be Elephantine, and don\u2019t be so bold as to assume your product will never decline relative to the market\u2014are you better at execution than Facebook?\n  3. Estimate monetization, i.e. revenue per customer^9. This curve might be Elephantine, but not necessarily. It is highly dependent on the product and market, on how distinct the product is competitively, on the budgets of the customers, and more. Facebook has a strong moat (network effect) and doesn\u2019t charge end-users, so they (like Google) can raise prices consistently. A product in a commoditized market might never be able to raise prices, and thus must find growth in avenues like increasing usage, the introduction of companion products, expanding to other verticals or geographies, or by applying their technology to new markets.\n\n> ^9 The definition of \u201ccustomer\u201d should match whatever activity is most\n> highly correlated with growth; this is also what \u201cmarket share\u201d should mean.\n> For normal products people pay for, this is simply \u201cpaying customers,\u201d but\n> for example in the case of Facebook, this is MAUs at least, perhaps even\n> DAUs.\n\nYou get better models by predicting each of these components separately, then\nmultiplying for a final growth prediction. You\u2019re also better able to track\nthe model against reality, as more data becomes available.\n\nBesides this break-down, there are many operational ideas suggested by the\nresults above, especially for managing marketing campaigns.\n\nThis might be expanded in a future article, but for now, these probing\nquestions might lead to better ideas on how to analyze and affect growth:\n\n### Advice for Marketing teams\n\n  * Is our AdWords campaign topped out? Are we fooling ourselves into thinking there\u2019s more inventory to access? How much more optimization is there to be had, and how would know? Are we hitting a decline due to uneconomical auctions, and if so, what is our reaction? When should we start experimenting with new channels, rather than continue to flog the AdWords channel for results that don\u2019t exist?\n\n  * Is it ok to be less cost-effective if it means we can stave off decline? Should we be that \u201cirrational bidder\u201d who bids \u201ctoo much\u201d because we\u2019re wise enough to see value beyond immediate cash pay-back? If so, how do we quantify that value, so we know just how \u201cirrational\u201d to be?\n\n  * To hit our growth goals for the year, what would have to be true of the growth of existing campaigns? Which can be reasonably expected to grow, hold steady, or shrink, based on their phase? How many additional, successful campaigns do we need, and how soon? Since not all that we attempt will succeed, how many do we need to start to yield the final quantity we need?\n\n  * Rather than stack up small, limited campaigns, is there something more substantial that could generate more total growth? A single, large new geography instead of many smaller ones? A single, substantial new sales mechanism (e.g. reselling) rather than more advertising? A different pricing model instead of an additional sales model? Even if it takes 10x the effort, and possible even if it takes 10x the time, it might have 10x the results.\n\n  * Or the reverse\u2014do we pull funds when we smell decline, rather than spending our time and money fighting a losing battle, accepting a short-term hit on top-line growth in exchange for more efficient growth? Do we try to stack up many smaller, more efficient campaigns, generating growth as a bulk effort? Each effort affects the top line only marginally, but conversely our growth is less sensitive to the decline of any one campaign.\n\n### Advice for Product Managers\n\n  * It\u2019s great to add a feature to an existing product, but significant additional growth comes from increasing carrying capacity or creating a new avenue of growth. Early on you should focus on winning market share in one space, creating the first Elephant Curve, but after the product matures, something more drastic is required: Wholly new products, or updates significant enough to address new markets.\n\n  * It\u2019s well-known that companies need to add additional products to continue fast growth after achieving scale. However the second product is highly unlikely to achieve same market share and monetary scale as the first, so there needs to be multiple, not just one^10. This requires serious investment, parallel efforts, and the chutzpah to kill off the ideas that aren\u2019t working.\n\n> ^10 This is true at any scale\u2014advertising is still 82% of Google\u2019s revenue;\n> of that 71% is advertising from search alone (i.e. excluding YouTube and\n> other properties). Apple revenue is 60% iPhone. Even at smaller scales:\n> Basecamp (ne\u00e9 37signals) built multiple products over nearly two decades but\n> only their first was successful enough to be worth working on; the company\n> divested itself of the rest and rebranded to be identical to that product.\n> It is possible for second products to eclipse the first; the iPhone was of\n> course not Apple\u2019s first product; The Tesla model 3 outsells the earlier\n> model X, And at my own company Smart Bear our second product ended up being\n> 95% of sales, and we essentially did the same as 37signals and went to a\n> single product model.\n\n  * Because word-of-mouth-driven growth is so much more effective than marketing-driven growth (both in cost-per-customer and in that unlike direct advertising it grows automatically as the company grows), it is worth a great deal of time trying to figure out how to build that into the product, rather than relying only on the marketing team.\n\n> Half my advertising is wasted. I just don\u2019t know which half. \u2014John Wanamaker\n\nMr. Wanamaker made his famous complaint more than a hundred years ago; even\nwith modern analytics, today it\u2019s worse. The quadratic growth model won\u2019t\nsolve that puzzle, but the better you understand the mechanisms of growth, the\nmore it is under your control.\n\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear https://longform.asmartbear.com/exponential-growth/\n\u00a9 2007-2024 Jason Cohen @asmartbear\n\n\u261e If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! \u261c\n\n##### Subscribe for more, and Thank you for sharing!\n\nThe Elephant in the room: The myth of exponential hypergrowth\n\n1 of 1\n\n### Thank you for sharing this article:\n\n### Inside this article\n\nNo ads.
