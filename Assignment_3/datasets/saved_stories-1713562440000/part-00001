A lot of capital. A giant pile of\ncash.\n\nThere are, to a first approximation, only three places you can find of a giant\npile of cash. There\u2019s government money. There\u2019s venture capital. And there\u2019s\nbig corporate R&D.\n\nThanks for reading The Future, Now and Then!

The reason is\nsimple: government funding doesn\u2019t come attached to some rich asshole who\ninevitably screws things up later.\n\nVenture capital, for this same reason, is quite clearly the worst. Andy\nBaio\u2019s, \u201cThe Quiet Death of Ello\u2019s Big Dream\u201d is worth reading on this point.\nVC funding comes attached to VC revenue expectations. It makes unreasonable\ndemands. Sometimes they work out for the investors. They very rarely work out\nfor everyone else.\n\nBig corporate money is somewhere in the middle. I\u2019d classify it as eh, fine I\nguess, so long as the marketplace is otherwise well-regulated and those large\ncorporations are constrained. (Which, heh, ofcoursewedon\u2019thaverightnow.)\n\nThe examples of big corporate money that spring immediately to mind are Bell\nLabs and Xerox PARC. There was indeed a time when big companies invested a ton\nin basic science and R&D, with no immediate plans to turn the results into\nproducts. And, as Ian Betteridge pointed out last month, this was because the\nbig companies were rightly concerned about the antitrust cops. A nervous\nmonopolist is a (relatively) well-behaved monopolist.\n\nStill, there\u2019s a bit of elegance to the big-pile-of-government-money approach.\nI first took notice of this with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act\n(IRA). Fifteen years ago, everyone kind of thought that the only way to\njumpstart the clean energy transition was to institute a carbon tax or cap-\nand-trade/cap-and-dividend system. (Basically, do some fancy tricks that the\neconomists suggested, then let the market work its magic.) Cap-and-Trade\nfailed for a whole lot of reasons, but one of the biggest was that the\nproposal was complex and boring in a way that appealed to the economists but\nwere impossible to message. Most people were left thinking \u201cthis is probably\ngonna turn into weird corporate bullshit, right?\u201d\n\nThe IRA, by contrast, was just a big pile of money attached to industrial\npolicy \u2014 directional instructions for how to spend the pile. That\u2019s\neffectively all it could be, because of some vagaries in the Senate rules that\nlet you avoid the filibuster and pass budget bills with a 51-vote majority.\nAnd while that big pile of money isn\u2019t perfect, it is funding a lot of good\nthings.\n\nAnd of course we can scan back in history for plenty of other examples. The\nsemiconductor industry and the internet were both built out of government\ngrants and defense contracts. We have sputnik and the space race to thank for\nthe computer age. The Human Genome Project was government funding. So was the\nNational Nanotechnology Initiative. Some of these were big hits, some were\nglancing misses. But the general model of promising avenue \u2014> government sets\nup a big pile of money \u2014> research and development flourishes in that area is\npretty well established. It works.\n\nThe are, as far as I can tell, only three downsides to the government-pile-of-\nmoney approach:\n\n  1. You\u2019ll need to make the money back through taxes on the industries that develop as a result. And they won\u2019t want to pay those taxes. And these industries will be popular, with a lot of capital to spend on pressuring government to give them special deals and tax breaks. So maintaining the equilibrium of establish big pile of government money \u2014> industries flourish \u2014> they pay taxes, which lets you set up the next big pile of government money is going to take constant effort to maintain. (This is an abbreviated version of Marianna Mazzucato\u2019s The Entrepreneurial State. Her book is excellent, btw.)\n\n  2. The big pile of government money is tied up in bureaucracy, which means it isn\u2019t especially nimble or responsive. This can be fixed through public-private partnerships and other administrative design choices. But it\u2019s bound to be frustrating and sometimes wasteful. (Imagine if, circa 2022, the Biden administration had set up a $30 billion fund for, like, metaverse research.) And that waste and frustration will be fodder for ideological opponents to the whole endeavor.\n\n  3. The big pile of government money doesn\u2019t glorify entrepreneurs and innovators as the very-special-boys who are heroically building the future. And that doesn\u2019t feel very gratifying. They would much prefer an equilibrium where government provides the big pile of money, but then no one talks about it. Or gives the government any credit. Or taxes the windfall profits. It is not, in other words, a story that plays well at Davos. If those entrepreneurs get rich enough, they\u2019ll develop elaborate philosophical justifications for why the most important cause in the world is that everyone clap louder for them.\n\nBut those three downsides just mean that the system will require political\nmaintenance. It works quite well, but it isn\u2019t self-sustaining. And this\nobservation extends beyond science and technology. The big-pile-of-government-\nmoney is a return to how we approached public problems through much of the\n20th century, before it was rejected as \u201ctax-and-spend\u201d liberalism and\nreplaced by neoliberalism\u2019s faith-based market fundamentalism.\n\nThe basic proposition is as follows: we should provide public funding for\npublic goods. Those public goods will make us a better, more productive\nsociety. And then we refill the public coffers through a system of taxation.\nThe same approach can be applied to other public goods:\n\n  * There is no magic-unicorn funding model that will save journalism. It\u2019s going to require public subsidy.\n\n  * The crises facing the U.S. education system can mostly be reduced to the simple fact that we no longer fund public education like we used to. The idea that we are going to somehow innovate our way into a system that is both higher-quality and cheaper is as fantastical as it is flawed.\n\n  * Ditto for higher education. If you think higher education is a public good, then you should demand public subsidy of higher ed. (Including, but not limited to, student debt cancellation.) If you do not think higher eduction is a public good, then that\u2019s fine too. But you ought to go ahead and say as much.\n\nThe VC approach is the prevailing model today. And I have become increasingly\nconvinced that many of the problems with the current state of Silicon Valley\nare rooted in the venture capital-class simply acquiring too much capital. VC\nis fine (good, even!) when it is relatively small. But when VC is the primary\nsource of funding new science and technology breakthroughs, the whole system\ngets skewed.\n\nAs it stands today, the primary direction-setter for new advances in science\nand technology is \u201cwhat do folks like Marc Andreessen and Peter Thiel and Gary\nTan and Sam Altman find exciting?\u201d\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t just that these guys are ideological fellow-travelers, hell\nbent on a shared political project that socializes all risk while privatizing\nall gain. (though, I mean... that would kinda be enough of a problem on its\nown.)\n\nIt\u2019s also that their eye for science, technology, and even consumer products\njust kinda sucks. Building toward their vision of the future means we\u2019re going\nto end up with a lot of silly investments in pretend-cities and eugenics\nvaporware. It means we\u2019ll have abundant funding for hail-mary attempts at\ndeveloping cold fusion and geo-engineering, and practically nothing for\nhelping cities remain habitable under extreme weather conditions.\n\n(Read Karen Hao, I\u2019m begging you!: We\u2019re sapping all the remaining water from\nthe desert to cool AI data centers. It\u2019s good for Microsoft\u2019s stock\nperformance. It is counterproductive to the climate emergency.)\n\nThis kind of VC-thinking works fine under limited conditions, and pretty\nterribly everywhere else.\n\nTake Sam Altman. Altman is not an engineer. He is not a scientist. He has no\nreal training in either. He is an entrepreneur, with a flair for optimistic\ntech futurism. He places bets on where technology is headed, and then attempts\nto bend society in a direction that makes those bets pay off.\n\nThe previous generation of venture capitalists were, for the most part, actual\nengineers and scientists. They had spent time in the lab. They had experience\nbeing \u201cclose to the metal.\u201d They made some real money early, then started to\npoint that money in the direction of funding audacious high-risk/high-reward\nprojects that didn\u2019t fit anywhere else. The sector was small, compared to\ngovernment money and corporate R&D money.\n\nFolks like Altman approach the future much like bad sci-fi. They begin from a\nprediction of where they\u2019d like to end up, and then work backwards. Altman has\nfaith that we\u2019re going to end up at world-changing Artificial General\nIntelligence. That means we\u2019ll need transformative breakthroughs in chip\nproduction and energy production. Ergo, he invests in cold fusion companies\nand sets out to raise $7 trillion to build his own manufacturing empire.\n\nThat\u2019s actually a fine approach, as private investment strategies go. (Hey,\nyou\u2019ve got a prediction for where the world is heading, and you want to make a\nbunch of correlated bets that support the prediction? Go ahead and spend your\nown money that way. God bless.) But when it becomes the primary source of\nfunding for basic science and/or applied technologies, then the whole system\ngets warped in the direction of a few billionaires\u2019 speculative fantasies.\n\nVenture Capital is not inherently better than government funding. That\u2019s a\nmyth that was popularized during the neoliberal era. It has now become\nimpossible to sustain. (Just look at all the stupid bullshit they fund and all\nthe nice things that they ruin!)\n\nBig Tech only got so big because we stopped enforcing antitrust 20+ years ago.\nIf the current reemergence of antitrust enforcement has staying power, that\nwill be good for society and also good for Big tech funding of basic research.\n\nBut, most of all, we should get back to enthusiastically celebrating large\npiles of government money, paired with substantial taxes on the companies that\nflourish as a result. Government money isn\u2019t perfect. It can be slow and\ninefficient. But nothing is perfect. And of all the potential big-pile-of-\nmoney sources, it is the one that does the most good, while putting power in\nthe hands of people who are at least supposed to have the best interests of\nthe public in mind.\n\nThanks for reading The Future, Now and Then!
