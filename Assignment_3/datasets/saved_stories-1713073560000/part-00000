The site describes five land sale events that\noccurred this spring in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nAnother land sale event held in Baltimore invited attendees to \u201cBuy Your Home\nin Israel Now!\u201d But, as with the other events, attendees couldn\u2019t just be\nanyone interested in some freshly stolen land. You have to be Jewish, but not\njust any kind of Jewish.\n\nGreg Kaplan, a local Jewish community member who wanted to learn more about\nthese restrictive events and who tried signing up for the April 1 land sale\nevent in Baltimore, which was hosted by the Jerusalem-based CapitIL Real\nEstate Agency, told me:\n\n> I got a call from Shmuly Eisenmann of CapitIL. He asked me where I daven,\n> who the rabbi is there, and for the rabbi\u2019s number, seeming incredulous that\n> I wouldn\u2019t just have the rabbi\u2019s number stored in my phone. He said he would\n> check on me with the rabbi and asked if the rabbi would know who I was. I\n> said probably not because I don\u2019t go to shul that much. He asked if there\n> was someone at another shul who could vouch for me.\n\nKaplan was not allowed into the event, which was scheduled to take place at\nShomrei Emunah, \u201ca full-service shul and Jewish center\u201d in Baltimore whose\nlist of speakers and scholars in residence includes an IDF lieutenant colonel.\n\n### Related Story\n\nNews Analysis\n\n|\n\nEducation & Youth\n\n## Israel Has Ruined 76 Percent of Gaza\u2019s Schools in Systematic Attack on\nEducation\n\nDenying Palestinians\u2019 right to education has been central to Israel\u2019s settler-\ncolonial project for eight decades.\n\nBy\n\n    Thea Renda Abu El-Haj ,\n    Fida J. Adely ,\n    Jo Kelcey ,\n    Truthout\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\nTruthout\n\nGillian Stoll, a member of the New Jersey chapter of IfNotNow, who tried to\nregister for the Teaneck, New Jersey, event on March 31, received a series of\nphone calls. On the first call, Stoll admits to being caught off guard by a\nslew of questions including the name of her temple and rabbi, his direct\nnumber as well as what the reading was at the temple that week. She gave the\nname of her old rabbi and temple, and the man calling seemed satisfied for the\nmoment, offering that they had to cancel previously \u201cbecause of protestors.\u201d\nShe then \u201cgot a second call from another not so nice guy saying he called the\nrabbi and he hadn\u2019t heard of me ... and asked how old I was ... and if I\u2019d\nbeen to Israel.\u201d Stoll was also not allowed into the event.\n\nNeedless to say, I \u2014 as a secular Jew who hasn\u2019t been to temple since about\n2007 and whose most recent run-in with a rabbi involved one chanting alongside\nme at an anti-Zionist action \u2014 didn\u2019t even get a phone call. And while these\ndiscriminatory practices might be necessary to avoid a bunch of anti-Zionist\nprotestors in your midst, they are, in fact, illegal.\n\nA recent press release from the Palestinian Assembly for Liberation (PAL) Law\nCommission pointed out that these land sale events \u201care illegal under the Fair\nHousing Act of 1968 and Civil Rights Act of 1965, since registration, entry,\nand participation are denied on the basis of identity (i.e., race, ethnicity,\nnational origin, and religion).\u201d\n\nThe commission added that these events violate not only U.S. law but also\ninternational law with regard to hosts \u201cexhibiting and offering properties on\nWest Bank settlements recognized as illegal by the U.S. Department of State\nand by international law\u201d including \u201cArticle 49 of the Geneva Convention ...\nSettlements have been found to be grave breaches of international law, and\ntherefore war crimes, by the International Court [ICJ] of Justice in 2004, and\nare also currently under review by the ICJ in the context of the case of South\nAfrica v. Israel for crimes of genocide, and by the International Criminal\nCourt.\u201d\n\nPAL Law Commission has filed notices and complaints with attorneys general and\nreal estate licensing authorities, and has also served formal cease and desist\nletters alongside notice and demand letters regarding their findings.\n\nWhen asked about responses from hosts or organizers, PAL spokesperson Hena\nZuberi said:\n\n> The response we\u2019ve received is them shifting their events online and/or\n> sponsors pulling out of the events, at least publicly. Although this hasn\u2019t\n> been a direct communication with us it came as an effect directly following\n> our legal action and served as a major legal and grassroots victory for the\n> case and the campaign overall. We\u2019ve shut down several events and moved\n> others online through this action.\n\nOne such event was scheduled to take place in Flatbush, Brooklyn, at the Khal\nBnei Avrohom Yaakov Simcha Hall and was later moved online after both legal\naction and local protests. Indeed, it\u2019s impossible to say whether legal\naction, direct action or a combination of the two has pushed the cancellation\nor relocation of land sale events. Either way, it\u2019s clear that hosts and\norganizers are uncomfortable with the attention, as they should be.\n\nOn the site listing the event in Flatbush as well as events in Montreal;\nToronto; Teaneck, New Jersey; and Lawrence, New York, a banner reads \u201cOur\nexpert speakers will address all your questions about purchasing real estate\nin Israel and focusing on: Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Ramat Beit Shemesh, Modiin,\nGivat Shmuel, Raanana, Neve Daniel, Efrat, Motza, Haifa, Ma\u2019ale Adumim,\nAshkelon, Netanya.\u201d\n\nWhen I sent this list of location names to Nora Barrows-Friedman, an associate\neditor at The Electronic Intifada who has covered Palestine for 20 years and\nhas a deep understanding of various demarcated zones and boundaries, she\nexplained:\n\n> Neve Daniel and Efrat are major settlements in the area between Bethlehem\n> and Hebron in the West Bank. Efrat is the settlement Palestinians call \u201cthe\n> snake\u201d because it\u2019s a narrow but long settlement that snakes atop the hills.\n> Ma\u2019ale Addumim is one of the largest settlements in the West Bank, and\n> Ashkelon is the city just north of Gaza.\n\nWithout more information on Modiin, she couldn\u2019t say whether or not it\u2019s\nModiin Illit, which is \u201cpart of the Ariel/Maale Addumim/E-1 settlement bloc.\u201d\nHowever, even without that clarification, it\u2019s clear that much of the property\non offer at least five of these land sale events falls within the West Bank.\nBut, as Barrows-Friedman pointed out, \u201cit\u2019s all occupied land, of course.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, violence and displacement has skyrocketed with roughly 4,000\nPalestinians displaced in the West Bank in 2023, the majority after October 7,\naccording to a February report by the UN Office for the Coordination of\nHumanitarian Affairs.\n\nTamara Nassar at The Electronic Intifada reported in late March that \u201cIsraeli\nforces and settlers have injured nearly 5,000 Palestinians in the West Bank\nsince 7 October, more than 700 of them children.\u201d The Express Tribune, a\nPakistani partner paper of The New York Times, reported on March 30 that some\n27,000 decares of land (roughly 6,600 acres) in the West Bank have been\nconfiscated by Israel just since October 7.\n\nThis displacement and violence looks many different ways, from airstrikes and\ntargeted demolition by \u201cmilitary operations,\u201d to physical attacks by armed\nsettlers, to what a friend of mine once called \u201cpaper genocide\u201d vis-a-vis\nPalestinians not having Israeli-issued building permits \u2014 permits basically no\nPalestinian can get because of the apartheid regime\u2019s discriminatory\npermitting policies. Zuberi points out that, like the violence against\nPalestinians, these land sale events \u201chave been occurring over a significant\nperiod ... well before the recent events in Gaza.\u201d\n\nThough an escalation in violence is clear, we must be careful to see October 7\nand its aftermath as a continuation of this colonial violence, rather than a\nbeginning. Likewise, the current critical attention being given to land sale\nevents is a credit to the growth of the Palestinian movement, not an\nindication of Israel having adopted a new colonialist tactic.\n\nIn short, be it 1948, 1967, 2014 or today, Palestine is occupied land, Israel\nupholds apartheid, and these land sale events are one of many tactics being\nused to disappear an Indigenous people and culture, to wipe them off the map\nliterally and figuratively, much as was done here in the so-called United\nStates with mass land sale events of so-called \u201cIndian land\u201d in the West.\n\nOutside the land sale event held on the stolen land known as Baltimore, our\nprotest was powerful. Palestinian flags waved above my head along with\nplacards and homemade signs decrying genocide and demanding justice and\nliberation. Bullhorns carried the message of \u201cFree Palestine\u201d and \u201cOccupation\nis a Crime.\u201d\n\nA woman paused in front of me and offered up a box of dates. I smiled and took\none, thanking her. She smiled back, adjusted her hijab and continued to weave\nher way between the small crowd that had assembled across the street from\nShomrei Emunah, where the land sale event was scheduled to take place.\n\nMeanwhile, across the street in front of Shomrei Emunah, a crowd of Zionist\ncounterprotesters waved the Israeli flag, and several marched across the\nstreet to get in our faces, spitting and yelling abuse and threats.\n\nPolice presence grew over the course of the evening, but it hardly dissuaded\nthe violent Zionists from harassing our group of peaceful protesters, some of\nwhom were at prayer. Several drivers hurled insults and threats as they drove\nby, some coming around several times waving Israeli and U.S. flags. A few cars\nrevved their engines and slammed on their brakes in front of us, reminding me\nvery starkly and grotesquely of the terrorist in Charlottesville, Virginia,\nwho drove his car into our group of anti-fascist protestors, killing Heather\nHeyer and injuring several others.\n\nAs the evening wore on, we heard news that the land sale event had been moved\nlast minute to a new location. A small victory, but a victory nonetheless.\nZuberi told me, \u201cThese victories would not have been possible without the\nrelentless pressure mounted by the PAL legal team and the local PAL chapters\u2019\nand allies\u2019 grassroots support and organizing.\u201d This grassroots organizing\nincluded the Baltimore chapter of Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP), the Council on\nAmerican-Islamic Relations\u2019 office in Maryland, and American Muslims for\nPalestine (AMP) as well as individuals such as me who, though not affiliated\nwith any one organization, felt the need to show up.\n\nCassidy Cohen with Jewish Voice for Peace\u2019s Baltimore chapter added: \u201cWe come\nfrom a Jewish tradition that has for millennia opposed empire, colonization\nand nationalism, that values every human life, and is rooted in social\njustice.... As Jews, we oppose all displacement and genocide of Palestinians.\nWe say never again for anyone.\u201d\n\nIn other words, to act in solidarity with tireless Palestinian leadership in\nthe struggle for their liberation is the mandate of all who believe in\njustice, especially us Jews.\n\n##### Tired of reading the same old news from the same old sources?\n\nSo are we!
