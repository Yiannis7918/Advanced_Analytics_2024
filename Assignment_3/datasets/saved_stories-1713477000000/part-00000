For homeowners not looking to move anytime soon,\nthe low rates they secured during the pandemic will benefit them for years to\ncome. But for many others, those rates have become a complication, disrupting\nboth household decisions and the housing market as a whole.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nIndeed, according to new research from economists at the Federal Housing\nFinance Agency, this lock-in effect is responsible for about 1.3 million fewer\nhome sales in America during the run-up in rates from the spring of 2022\nthrough the end of 2023. That\u2019s a startling number in a nation where around\nfive million homes sell annually in more normal times \u2014 most of those to\npeople who already own.\n\nThese locked-in households haven\u2019t relocated for better jobs or higher pay,\nand haven\u2019t been able to downsize or acquire more space. They also haven\u2019t\nopened up homes for first-time buyers. And that\u2019s driven up prices and gummed\nup the market.\n\nAnother way to state how unusual this dynamic is: Between 1998 and 2020, there\nwas never a time when more than 40 percent of American mortgage holders had\nlocked-in rates more than one percentage point below market conditions. By the\nend of 2023, as the chart below shows, about 70 percent of all mortgage\nholders had rates more than three percentage points below what the market\nwould offer them if they tried to take out a new loan.\n\nShare of existing mortgages with rates below or above new market rates\nPercentage point difference from rates on new mortgages\n\nFederal Housing Finance Agency analysis.

Rates then fell with the dot-com recession, and dropped further\ncoming out of the Great Recession. Many homeowners also refinanced along the\nway.\n\nThen early in the pandemic, rates bottomed out at historical lows, giving many\nhouseholds bargains below 3 percent.\n\nDistribution of fixed rates held by existing mortgage holders\n\n1999\n\nBefore the dot-com recession\n\n2005\n\nDuring the housing boom\n\n2011\n\nEmerging from the Great Recession\n\n2019\n\nOn the eve of the pandemic\n\n2023\n\nPost-pandemic\n\nSource: Federal Housing Finance Agency analysis. Note: Data shown captures the\nfourth quarter of each year.\n\nFor most of this period of generally declining rates and regular refinancing,\nmost homeowners held rates that weren\u2019t so different \u2014 within a single\npercentage point or so \u2014 from what they could get on a new loan. If you held a\nmortgage rate higher than the market, that made moving or refinancing\nrelatively painless. If you held a lower one, the difference was seldom big\nenough to discourage people from changing homes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut that shifted significantly in the last two years as the Fed battled\ninflation, and as interest rates on all kinds of loans spiked.\n\nIt might seem strange to suggest there\u2019s a problem now with so many people\nhaving scored great housing deals during the pandemic. The problem arises from\nthe fact that rates rose from their pandemic low so high, so fast. Seemingly\novernight, most American homeowners with mortgages found themselves in a\nsituation where it might now feel financially foolish to sell their home.\n\n\u201cYou could think of your locked-in rate as an asset that you own,\u201d said Julia\nFonseca, a professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\n\nAnd over this period, that asset has never been worth as much as it is now.\n\nProfessor Fonseca estimates that locked-in rates are worth about $50,000 to\nthe average mortgage holder. That\u2019s roughly the additional amount people would\nhave to spend if they swapped the existing payments left on their current\nmortgages for higher payments at today\u2019s rates.\n\nPut another way, the F.H.F.A. researchers estimate that this difference was\nworth about $511 a month to the average mortgage holder by the end of 2023.\nThat\u2019s enough to influence the decisions households make and cause shock waves\nin the housing market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThese are real families that are not able to optimize their housing,\u201d said\nJonah Coste, a F.H.F.A. economist who worked on the research.\n\nThe ripple effects are already evident in other research. The economists Jack\nLiebersohn and Jesse Rothstein find that mobility rates fell for homeowners\nwith mortgages in 2022 and 2023, at a time when there were no comparable\ndeclines in mobility for homeowners without mortgages or for renters.\n\nProfessor Fonseca and Lu Liu at the University of Pennsylvania also find that\nhomeowners who are more locked in are less likely to move to nearby areas with\nhigh wage growth. That suggests how kinks in the housing market can create\nproblems in the labor market, eventually preventing businesses from hiring the\nright workers, or preventing wages from rising further.\n\nAll of this stems not simply from the level of high rates today, but from the\nparticular sequence of events that led us here.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never had anything like the last four years,\u201d Professor Rothstein said.\n\nSome of these effects may sound similar to the years after the 2008 housing\ncrash, when a different problem \u2014 underwater mortgages \u2014 trapped many people\nin homes they wanted to leave. But today\u2019s challenge may be more lasting.\nThat\u2019s because 30-year mortgage rates get locked in for, well, 30 years, and\nbecause rates below 3 percent are unlikely to be seen again anytime soon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nPresident Biden has made note of how unsettling this may feel to many people.\nIn his State of the Union last month, he spoke directly to anyone fretting\nabout interest rates. \u201cIf inflation keeps coming down, mortgage rates will\ncome down as well,\u201d he said.\n\nBut while many Americans wait, he proposed temporary tax credits worth up to\n$10,000 for new buyers and the owners who sell to them. For first-time buyers\ndoing the psychologically fraught mortgage math at home, the White House\npoints out that for the median-priced home, this is equivalent to reducing\nrates by more than 1.5 percentage points for two years.\n\nFor the homeowners who\u2019ve so far been unwilling to sell, however, that sum is\na good deal less than the $50,000 that locked-in rates are effectively worth\nto the typical mortgage holder.\n\nEmily Badger writes about cities and urban policy for The Times from\nWashington.
