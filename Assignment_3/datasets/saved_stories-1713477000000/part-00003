Reed (https://www.deepplum.com/contactinfo)\n\n[Note: an earlier version of this essay was prepared as an online supplement\nto an article in Context magazine published in Spring 1999]\n\nBob Metcalfe, inventor of the Ethernet, is known for pointing out that the\ntotal value of a communications network grows with the square of the number of\ndevices or people it connects. This scaling law, along with Moore's Law, is\nwidely credited as the stimulus that has driven the stunning growth of\nInternet connectivity. Because Metcalfe's law implies value grows faster than\ndoes the (linear) number of a network's access points, merely interconnecting\ntwo independent networks creates value that substantially exceeds the original\nvalue of the unconnected networks. Thus the growth of Internet connectivity,\nand the openness of the Internet, are driven by an inexorable economic logic,\njust as the interconnection of the telephone network was forced by AT&T's long\ndistance strategy. This strategy created huge and increasing value to AT&T\ncustomers, based on the same (then unnamed) law of increasing returns to scale\nat the beginning of the 20th century. In the same way, the global\ninterconnection of networks we call the Internet has created huge and\nincreasing value to all its participants.\n\nBut many kinds of value are created within networks. While many kinds of value\ngrow proportionally to network size and some grow proportionally to the square\nof network size, I've discovered that some network structures create total\nvalue that can scale even faster than that. Networks that support the\nconstruction of communicating groups create value that scales exponentially\nwith network size, i.e. much more rapidly than Metcalfe's square law. I will\ncall such networks Group-Forming Networks, or GFNs.\n\nEven if it's not your business to supply communications services, your\nbusiness participates in many networks\u2014perhaps the most important are supply\nnetworks that allows access to and bidding among suppliers and distribution\nnetworks that allows access to and competition among customers. The structure\nof these networks or market spaces, especially the value of the connectivity\nand relationships produced in these networks, can play a crucial role in\ndefining the value of your business. If you can manage or influence the\nnetworks that connect you to suppliers and customers to create more value for\nall concerned, that extra value can be used as a competitive weapon. So paying\nattention to network value is a crucial strategic issue, especially as\nbusinesses move their customer and supplier relationships into the 'net.\n\nWhat kind of value are we talking about, when we say the value of a network\nscales as some function of size? The answer is the value of potential\nconnectivity for transactions. That is, for any particular access point\n(user), what is the number of different access points (users) that can be\nconnected or reached for a transaction when the need arises. As a simple\nillustration, consider a phone that can call only 911. A customer for such a\nphone buys it because of a low probability future need to call for emergency\nhelp; in fact, the customer probably takes other steps never to need to use\nthe phone. But the existence of a lucrative market for such phones indicates\nthat customers can value potential connectivity to a single point, even though\nthe connection is never used. Potential connectivity to many points should\nhave value proportionally larger, since it is not necessary to use the\nconnection to find value in its availability.\n\nThe value of potential connectivity is the value of the set of optional\ntransactions that are afforded by the system or network. Economically, the\nvalue of each optional transaction is like a financial option (e.g., the value\nof an option to buy a share of stock at a particular price). To simplify the\nmodel and focus on scaling, I'll assume that the value of any particular\noptional transaction in a network comes from a distribution that does not\ndepend strongly on the number of participants in the network.\n\nMetcalfe's law, simply derived, says that if you build a network so that any\ncustomer can choose to transact with any other customer, the number of\npotential connections each of the N customers can make is (N-1), giving a\ntotal number of potential connections as N(N-1) or N^2-N. Assuming each\npotential connection is worth as much as any other, the value to each user\ndepends on the total size of the network, and the total value of potential\nconnectivity scales much faster than the size of the network, proportional to\nN^2.\n\nAt this point a skeptic once said to me, that's too simplistic, that's not the\nmost important source of value in the network like the phone network. For\nexample, there's a weather service that everyone calls once a day, and the 911\nservice, and a couple of other services like that. And each user typically has\na fixed, small set of friends and family that they call all of the time. Since\nthe value of these services to a particular user does not depend on the number\nof other users of the network, the total value of these services grows more\nslowly\u2014proportional to N, not N^2.\n\nThe skeptic was right that some important services scale only linearly, but in\ndrawing his conclusion missed a crucial, very important point about scale and\ngrowth. To illustrate this, let's assume that we can lump all of the kinds of\nvalue that grow proportional to N in one term, which we can write by the\nformula aN, where a is a constant that represents the value per customer. We\ncan also represent the value of potential connectivity by bN^2, where b is the\nconstant value of a potential connection between a pair of customers. Let's\nassume that b is much smaller than a, so that for a modest size network, the\ntotal network value aN + bN^2 is for all intents and purposes the same as aN.\nBut still, if we allow N to get large enough, the total network value will get\ncloser and closer to bN^2. Thus, the \"square\" value of potential connectivity\ndominates all linear sources of value once N gets sufficiently large. See\nfigure 1, which shows how, when N is small, the total value is approximately\nlinear, but as N gets larger, the total value begins to follow bN^2.\n\nThis dominance of peer connection value suggests that it is foolish for phone\ncompanies to lust after the video rental business in an attempt to compete\nwith cable. As networks get larger, the value of peer connectivity is likely\nto dominate the combined capability of phone and cable networks. Only when the\npotential consumers of peer connectivity have been saturated does it seem\nsensible to go after businesses where value grows linearly with customer base.\nOf course, the same scaling dominance suggests that cable TV networks ought to\ndo whatever is necessary to enable their systems to support telephony and\nother transactional services if possible!\n\nBut there's an additional, new wrinkle to network scaling. I recently\ndiscovered a new value-creation effect that dominates even the remarkable\neffects of Metcalfe's Law, when a network supports it.\n\nIn networks like the Internet, Group Forming Networks (GFNs) are an important\nadditional kind of network capability. A GFN has functionality that directly\nenables and supports affiliations (such as interest groups, clubs, meetings,\ncommunities) among subsets of its customers. Group tools and technologies\n(also called community tools) such as user-defined mailing lists, chat rooms,\ndiscussion groups, buddy lists, team rooms, trading rooms, user groups, market\nmakers, and auction hosts, all have a common theme\u2014they allow small or large\ngroups of network users to coalesce and to organize their communications\naround a common interest, issue, or goal. Sadly, the traditional telephone and\nbroadcast/cable network frameworks provide no support for groups.\n\nWhat I found that's surprising and important is that GFNs create a new kind of\nconnectivity value that scales exponentially with N. Briefly, the number of\nnon-trivial subsets that can be formed from a set of N members is 2^N-N-1,\nwhich grows as 2^N. Thus, a network that supports easy group communication has\na potential number of groups that can form that grows exponentially with N.\n\nThe exponential, 2^N, is a sneaky function. Though it may be very small\ninitially, it grows much faster than N^2, N^3 or any other power law. So if\nthere is any portion of the total network value that grows exponentially,\nscale effects will eventually bring that value to the fore, where it will\ndominate any other source of value. (To put it simply, if a network's value\nconsists of components that scale proportional to N, N^2, and 2^N, we can\nwrite the total value as aN + bN^2 + c2^N where a, b, and c are constants. As\nlong as a, b, and c are positive, there will be some M such that the total\nvalue is dominated by the term c2^N for all N>M. Even if c is quite small, the\nexponential will eventually dominate.) See figure 2.\n\nLaw:| Sarnoff| Metcalfe| GFN (Reed)  \n---|---|---|---  \nOptional Transactions| Tune In Broadcast| Connect Peers| Join/Create Groups  \nExamples| OnSale, Remote Access| Yahoo! Classifieds, EMail| eBay, Chat Rooms  \nValue of N member net| N| N^2| 2^N  \nCombined Value of N, M member nets| N + M| N^2 + M^2 + 2NM| 2^N x 2^M  \n  \nThis exponential law of GFNs, like Metcalfe's Law, creates increasing returns\nas scale increases, which has surprising economic results.\n\nBoth laws give a powerful bonus to interconnection; mergers and partnerships\nof networked companies should be able to extract a premium resulting from\nthese laws. When we combine two networks together so that users of one network\ncan connect seamlessly to users of the other, Metcalfe's Law tells us already\nthat substantial new value is created: (M+N)^2 = M^2 +N^2+2MN. This bonus\nterm, 2MN, is substantial-up to 100% of the value in the original unconnected\nnetworks. Thus there is an enormous incentive to find ways to interconnect\nnetworks, since the members of each network can access a much larger set of\npotential transaction partners. With the GFN law, interconnection is even more\npowerful, creating many new potential groups that span the two networks: 2^M+N\n= 2^M2^N. The GFN interconnection bonus percentage itself grows exponentially\nwith the size of the smaller network.\n\nWhat we see, then, is that there are really at least three categories of value\nthat networks can provide: the linear value of services that are aimed at\nindividual users, the \"square\" value from facilitating transactions, and\nexponential value from facilitating group affiliations. What's important is\nthat the dominant value in a typical network tends to shift from one category\nto another as the scale of the network increases. Whether the growth is by\nincremental customer additions, or by transparent interconnection, scale\ngrowth tends to support new categories of killer apps, and thus new\ncompetitive games. See figure 3.\n\nWe can see this scale-driven value shift in the history of the Internet. The\nearliest usage of the Internet was dominated by its role as a terminal\nnetwork, allowing many terminals to selectively access a small number of\ncostly timesharing hosts. As the Internet grew, much more of the usage and\nvalue of the Internet became focused on pairwise exchanges of email messages,\nfiles, etc. following Metcalfe's Law. And as the Internet started to take off\nin the early ' 90's, traffic started to be dominated by \"newsgroups\" (Internet\ndiscussion groups), user created mailing lists, special interest websites,\netc., following the exponential GFN law. Though the previously dominant\nfunctions did not lose value or decline as the scale of the Internet grew, the\nvalue and usage of services that scaled by newly dominant scaling laws grew\nfaster. Thus many kinds of transactions and collaboration that had been\nconducted outside the Internet became absorbed into the growth of the\nInternet's functions, and these become the new competitive playing field.\n\nWhat's important in a network changes as the network scale shifts. In a\nnetwork dominated by linear connectivity value growth, \"content is king.\" That\nis, in such networks, there is a small number of sources (publishers or\nmakers) of content that every user selects from. The sources compete for users\nbased on the value of their content (published stories, published images,\nstandardized consumer goods). Where Metcalfe's Law dominates, transactions\nbecome central. The stuff that is traded in transactions (be it email or voice\nmail, money, securities, contracted services, or whatnot) are king. And where\nthe GFN law dominates, the central role is filled by jointly constructed value\n(such as specialized newsgroups, joint responses to RFPs, gossip, etc.).\n\nIn \"real\" networks, it is important to note that although the total value of\noptional transactions that involve pairs and groups grows faster than\nlinearly, the total price that can be paid cannot grow that fast. Typically,\nthe consumers of the value have money and attention resources that scale\nlinearly with N. So the law of supply and demand will kick in, lowering prices\nuntil the available resources (dollars and attention) are saturated. What's\ninteresting is that this saturation process affects all types of optional\ntransactions-so GFN value, peer transaction value, and broadcast content value\nall compete for the same resources. Once N grows sufficiently large, GFN\ntransactions create more value per unit of network investment than peer\ntransactions, and peer transactions create more value per unit of network\ninvestment than do broadcast transactions. So what tends to happen is that as\nnetworks grow, peer transactions out-compete broadcast content in the arena of\nattention and return on investment. And remarkably, once N gets sufficiently\nlarge, GFN transactions will out-compete both of the other categories.\n\nThe chart in Figure 4 is based on a simple model of saturation and competition\nfor dollars and attention. As N grows, first peer transactions start to gain\n\"market share\" at the cost of broadcast, and the GFN transactions gain share.\n\nScale driven value shifts will powerfully shape electronic commerce. The\nInternet auction pioneer, OnSale, is based on a business model that scales\nlinearly, proportionally to the reach of its network. OnSale buys closeout\nproducts and auctions them to anyone who can access its website to present a\nbid. In return, OnSale gets margin on every sale. Online classifieds, which\nconnect buyers to sellers on a peer-to-peer basis, would seem to create a\nmarket space whose value follows Metcalfe's Law. We'd expect to see a shift of\ndominance from OnSale to online classifieds once the network tools for safe\npeer transactions can be made to work. But the newly public company eBay seems\ndestined to capture a scale shift to the exponential logic of GFNs in creating\nvalue for its members. EBay's concept is to help its members to set up\nspecialized auction communities on its website as buyers and sellers of many\nkinds of collectibles, art, and other easily traded special interest goods.\nThough eBay's share of the transactions it facilitates is much smaller than\nOnSale's share, eBay's returns can increase much more rapidly with scale. This\ngrowth in returns will be driven by an exponential growth in value of the eBay\nGFN as its membership increases (and new kinds of jointly constructed value\nbecome important-e.g. eBay's origins in creating a market for Pez candy\ndispenser collectors).\n\nScale driven value shifts have already caused IBM subsidiary Lotus, the\npioneer of enterprise groupware, to incorporate features into Notes/Domino to\ninterconnect in a limited way with the faster-growing Internet. But Notes'\nenterprise focus makes it difficult to support ad hoc groups that live outside\nlarge enterprise boundaries or span multiple enterprises. Though the email\ncapabilities of Notes can easily interconnect with other Internet email\nsystems across boundaries to capture a fair share of Metcalfe's Law value as\nthe Internet grows, Lotus has chosen an enterprise-oriented model for sales\nand an enterprise focused security model. That choice effectively limits GFN\nreach to a few islands scattered throughout a vast Internet. Thus scale driven\nvalue seems likely to shift dominance to new groupware products and business\nmodels that can capture exponential value growth by enabling all Internet\nusers to affiliate flexibly. By facilitating easy ad hoc creation of\n\"teamrooms\", Instinctive's eRoom and Excite's Excite Communities, among\nothers, seem likely to capture big shares of a scale driven value shift from\nemail to ad hoc project team collaboration.\n\nAs digital networking brings scale and global reach to all aspects of our\nlives and activities, there will be many more ways that we'll see scale driven\nvalue shifts that threaten established business networking patterns. For\nexample, health care networks may move from treatment transactions to\ncollaborations around disease management. Risk management in the financial\nservices sector may move to group-forming structures that facilitate\nmanagement of \"micro-risks\". How will it impact your business and your\nindustry?\n\nI'd like to close with a speculative thought. As Francis Fukuyama argues in\nhis book Trust, there is a strong correlation between the prosperity of\nnational economies and social capital, which he defines culturally as the ease\nwith which people in a particular culture can form new associations. There is\na clear synergy between the sociability that Fukuyama discusses and the\ntechnology and tools that support GFNs-both are structural supports for\nassociation. As the scale of interaction grows more global via the Internet,\nisn't it possible that a combination of social capital and GFN capital will\ndrive prosperity to those who recognize the value of network structures that\nsupport free and responsible association for common purposes?\n\nFor further information\n\nI've begun assembling a collection of materials related to the concept of\nGroup Forming Networks on my website.
