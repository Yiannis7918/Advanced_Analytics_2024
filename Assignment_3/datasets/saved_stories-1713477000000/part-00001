A shortage of the medicine has contributed to\nbehavioral issues that led him to be sent home from school.\n\nDr. Jennifer Miller has been an author of dozens of studies about rare\nendocrine diseases over the last two decades. Hundreds of patients fly to\nGainesville, Fla., from all over the U.S. to see her for treatment.\n\nBut now, her office is inundated with faxes, emails, texts and phone calls\nthat have little to do with her life's work. Miller, a professor of pediatric\nendocrinology at the University of Florida's College of Medicine, has research\npapers in her inbox that just need a few finishing touches before publication\nin medical journals. She doesn't have time for them.\n\nA shortage of growth hormone \u2014 as well as how insurance companies are handling\nthe problem \u2014 has consumed nearly every spare minute she has had for the last\nsix months.\n\nNorditropin, the growth hormone prescribed most often, went into shortage in\nthe fall of 2022. It's still scarce a year and a half later, despite\nassurances from Novo Nordisk, maker of the drug, that supplies would stabilize\nin 2024. As people try to switch to other brands, a ripple effect has been\ncausing shortages of those products too.\n\n### Children feel the effects of drug shortage\n\nFor Miller's patients, 500 of whom have a rare disorder called Prader-Willi\nsyndrome, it has been devastating. Without the injectable drug, they are\nalways hungry, causing blood sugar and behavioral problems, weight gain and\nother complications.\n\n\"These kids are suffering. And it's not OK,\" she says. \"It's overall just a\nhorrendous situation because they're eating more, they're gaining weight more,\nyou know, and they're having a ton of behavioral problems. And it's been a\nhuge issue for us to not be able to get growth hormone for some of these\npeople for over six months now.\"\n\nGrowth hormone is prescribed for conditions like growth failure due to a\nhormone deficiency, short stature due to various genetic conditions, and\nPrader-Willi syndrome. Sometimes, it's needed only for the years a child is\ngrowing. But for others, like Prader-Willi patients, it is a lifelong\ntreatment.\n\n\"People think: 'Growth hormone. Oh, big deal, right? It's for growth. Who\ncares if you don't have it?' But that's not the point,\" says Miller. \"They're\nhaving actual physiologic consequences from not being on growth hormone. And\nto me, that's just not acceptable.\"\n\n### Prior authorizations compound the problem\n\nTo make matters worse, insurance companies are making patients and clinicians\njump through extra hoops to get the drug \u2014 even during the shortage.\n\nMost insurance companies require a prior authorization for growth hormone,\nmeaning health care providers need to justify their prescription with the\ninsurance company before the company will cover the drug, allowing the\npharmacy to dispense it to the patient. The process can take days or weeks,\nwhich is cumbersome but at least was required only once or twice a year for\nmost families.\n\nNow that the drugs are in shortage, patients and doctors are chasing whatever\nsize injection pen and whatever brand is available. That triggers insurance\ncompanies to ask for a new prescription and new prior authorization every time\npatients need to switch gears and ask for a different pen size because their\nnormal one is out of stock.\n\n\"It's just we're switching pen sizes because that's what's available at the\nmoment,\" Miller says. \"And so we spend all day doing these prescriptions and\nprior authorizations. And then by the time the prior [authorization] is\nprocessed, 48 hours later, oftentimes that is out too.\"\n\nKaren Van Nuys, a health economist at the University of Southern California\nwho has studied prior authorizations, says they have increased dramatically\nfor all kinds of drugs in the last 10 years. \"As you might imagine, doctors\nhate this process,\" she says. \"It's incredibly time-consuming on their part\nand keeps them from doing more patient-focused work and introduces delay.\"\n\nNow that growth hormone is in shortage, it's particularly cumbersome.\n\nSome families say they have been through five prior authorizations in one\nmonth before they could get pens shipped to them. Others were told to have\ntheir doctors resend prescriptions multiple times only to be told there was no\ndrug at all. And some paid for drugs they never got.\n\n/ Bridget Bennett for NPR\n\n/\n\nBridget Bennett for NPR\n\nHillary and Jeff Hall were able to get a supply of Omnitrope, a growth\nhormone, from Mexico. But the medicine cost $1,400 and wasn't covered by the\nLas Vegas family's insurance.\n\nHillary Hall, who lives in Las Vegas, has spent hours on the phone trying to\nget growth hormone for her 9-year-old son, Winston Hall, who has Prader-Willi\nsyndrome.\n\n\"I'll get it one month, and then they're like, 'Oh, well, we're out of that\npen now. Now we need a new prescription and a new pre-authorization,'\" she\nsays. \"That's not just like an overnight process. It's like a couple-of-weeks\nthing. And then by the time they mail it out to me, you know, we're talking\nthree weeks.\"\n\nWinston wasn't able to get any growth hormone for three months. The behavioral\nconsequences became especially bad.\n\n\"He was getting kicked out of school once a week for the last three weeks,\"\nHillary says.\n\n\"He has a hard time getting through the day without having outbursts and\nthings like that,\" says his father, Jeff Hall. \"They send him home because\nhe's had a breakdown and, you know, like tearing stuff off walls.\"\n\nThey eventually went without their insurance and bought Winston a 30-day\nsupply of growth hormone from Mexico for $1,400.\n\n### Challenges remain, despite some improvement\n\nNovo Nordisk says it is \"taking every action possible\" to ramp up supply,\nwhich it says has become more consistent since earlier in the shortage. It\nalso says it's working with insurers and specialty pharmacies to simplify\ntheir processes for dispensing medicines.\n\nThe company said in an email to NPR on March 20 that it was temporarily\ndiscontinuing one of its pen sizes to focus on the others. It expected to\ncontinue to have supply problems for at least a few more months.\n\nNPR asked all three major pharmacy benefit managers, which handle prescription\ndrugs for insurance companies, why they're still requiring new prescriptions\nand prior authorizations every time a patient switches during the shortage.\n\n/ Bridget Bennett for NPR\n\n/\n\nBridget Bennett for NPR\n\nMembers of the Hall family pose for a photo at their Las Vegas home: parents\nHillary and Jeff and children Winston (from left), Maggie and Walker.\n\nIn an emailed statement, CVS Caremark defended its decision to keep prior\nauthorization in place for growth hormone. The statement said that prior\nauthorization can help keep costs down for employers sponsoring their\nemployees' health plans and that the Food and Drug Administration doesn't\nconsider different brand names interchangeable, requiring a new prescription\nwhen patients switch brands because one is out of stock.\n\nExpress Scripts said it has offered plan sponsors, such as employers, some\noptions to help patients during drug shortages in general: \"That may include\nrecommendations on additional preferred formulary alternatives, and in some\ncases, preapproving alternatives for the impacted medications to minimize\nextra steps for prescribers and patients.\" It didn't say what it was doing\nspecifically for the growth hormone shortage but added that the company is in\ntouch with the manufacturers and hoping the shortage will be resolved \"in the\ncoming weeks.\"\n\nOptum Rx said that it has \"made several formulary and utilization management\nchanges to ensure members have access to somatropin products. This included\nadding more [growth hormone] products to [the] formulary and allowing members\nto switch among formulary [growth hormone] products and strengths without\ngenerating additional prior authorization reviews.\"\n\nThat seems to be some progress, says Miller, the University of Florida doctor.\nAs recently as February, Miller said, not a single insurer had taken the step\nof removing the prior authorization requirement during the shortage.\n\nCopyright 2024 NPR.
