It is\nfree and open source, you can look at source code on Github. Lume is actively\nimproving the app and adding new features, you can expect new update every\nmonth.\n\nDownload\n\n### What is nostr & how does it work?\n\nNostr stands for Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays. It is an open,\npermission-less protocol that aims to provide censorship-resistance and\ninteroperability. It can be used to create social networks or just about any\nother type of app (other stuff part of the acronym). It is not a single\nwebsite or app, but the glue that holds together many apps (clients) and Lume\nis one of it.\n\nAt its core, nostr consists of relays and events. A person does something\n(event) and this event is sent to a relay. The relay stores the event, then\nwaits for another person to request it. The most common types of events are\nnotes and reactions - the stuff social media is made of, but there are many\nother types of events. It works very similar to how any other app would work\nwith a database, except in nostr there is no single database, rather a large\nnumber of relays that store the events.\n\n### Lume is multiple columns experience\n\nLume is display your timeline as multiple column, each column is each\ndifferent content and you can define your experience\n\nYou can create a column to display newsfeed from specific people, you can\ncreate a column to display all contents related to some hashtags. It all up to\nyou.\n\n### \"For You\"\n\nUnlike some social networks, they feed you by algorithm. In Lume, you totally\ncontrol what to will see\n\n### Download and Explore\n\n(Universal) macOS: Lume_3.0.0_universal.dmg\n\n(x86-64) Windows 11: Lume_3.0.0_x64-setup.exe\n\n(x86-64) Ubuntu: lume_3.0.0_amd64.deb\n\n(x86-64) Fedora: lume-3.0.0-1.x86_64.rpm\n\n(x86-64) Linux Flatpak: lume_3.0.0_amd64.flatpak\n\n(x86-64) Linux AppImage: lume_3.0.0_amd64.AppImage\n\nSupport for ARM, RISC-V and Loongarch architecture are coming soon.\n\nSupported by Open Sats and Community\n\n", "frontpage": false}
