Back there, before the facial recognition\nalgorithms and the generative AIs, I thought it would be good to show the face\nto pass... credibility? Confidence? I don\u2019t know. Maybe it wasn\u2019t even a\nnecessity as it\u2019s today, because we didn\u2019t have AIs that wrote convincing\ngibberish. Simpler times.\n\nI started thinking about removing some of the photos from my face from the\ninternet. I deleted some photos of obvious places that are under my control,\nsuch as social media and my website, and found that it takes time for search\nengines and some platforms to \u201cnotice\u201d the update or even delete the images. I\nwas reminded that, also in a very literal sense, the internet doesn\u2019t forget.\n\nThen I realized that I posted dozens of videos on YouTube showing my face.\nMaybe it\u2019s a lost case.\n\nStill, I decided to use a silly avatar where possible: an orange ball with a\nsmiling face. You can see it on this site\u2019s footer.\n\nBefore that, I tried to use one of the ugly avatars I mentioned up there. I\nreplaced my picture with it on Telegram and right after I got an email from\nsomeone thinking my account was hacked.\n\n\u00ab Almost no one cares whether your site is on social media\n\nSubscribe to my newsletter:\n\nRodrigo Ghedin is a Brazilian journalist covering consumer tech for a small,\nindependent publication called Manual do Usu\u00e1rio.
