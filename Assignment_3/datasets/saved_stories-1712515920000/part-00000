And he invested over 12 million dollars in the\ncompany I built based on it. You may never have heard of it because we were\ntoo early. But now I'm back at it - and the timing is just right.\n\n#### Jordan Ritter\n\nApr 3, 2023 \u2022 7 min read\n\nprompt: rectangle brown glasses on top of a pile of smartphones and laptops\n\nLast week, Bill Gates published an incredibly insightful article about the Age\nOf AI. One paragraph caught my eye:\n\n> Advances in AI will enable the creation of a personal agent. Think of it as\n> a digital personal assistant: It will see your latest emails, know about the\n> meetings you attend, read what you read, and read the things you don\u2019t want\n> to bother with. This will both improve your work on the tasks you want to do\n> and free you from the ones you don\u2019t want to do. You\u2019ll be able to use\n> natural language to have this agent help you with scheduling,\n> communications, and e-commerce, and it will work across all your devices.\n\nHe goes on to say,\n\n> Because of the cost of training the models and running the computations,\n> creating a personal agent is not feasible yet, but thanks to the recent\n> advances in AI, it is now a realistic goal.\n\nWhat's interesting about that paragraph is: it's something I described to\nBill, 10 years ago. And he invested over 12 million dollars in the company I\nbuilt based on it \u2014 Atlas Informatics. You may never have heard of it because\nwe were too early \u2014 as Bill said, the AI technology wasn\u2019t there yet. But now\nI'm back at it, building the next version of Atlas with Augment AI \u2014 and the\ntiming is just right.\n\nLet me tell you the story.\n\nAlmost 10 years ago, I found myself standing on a street corner right around\nsunset, having just sold my company and signed the paperwork. As I was\ncontemplating what was next, I thought, \u201cWow, my entire world just evaporated.\nWhat am I going to do now? Selling a company is great, but everything, my\npeople, my purpose \u2014 everything is gone. What am I going to do with myself\nnow?\u201d\n\nAt this precise moment, my phone rang. It was Bill Gates\u2019 team.\n\n\u201cWe represent some well-known Seattle-based investors,\u201d they said. \u201cWe love\nyour background and track record, and we'd like to back your next play. Do you\nknow what it is you want to do?\u201d\n\n...\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d\n\nI was too stunned to speak. Serendipity had struck like a lightning bolt.\n\nA month later, I found myself sitting outside Bill Gates\u2019 office. He and\nNathan Myhrvold had been working at Intellectual Ventures on deep science\nprojects and yearned to get back into productivity software \u2014 outside of\nMicrosoft. They needed an entrepreneur to work with, and they called me.\n\nAnd so it was, 10 years ago \u2014 2013 \u2014 while sitting outside Gates\u2019 office, I\nreceived a fateful notification on my phone. It read, \u201cTime to go!\u201d It was\nthat moment when I thought, \u201cWow. That\u2019s dumb. This thing is always on, always\nconnected, has infinite storage talking to the cloud, has all my email,\ncalendar, and files - yet it doesn\u2019t know me at all. It just told me to leave,\nbut I'm already here.\u201d\n\nI had mere minutes left before it was time to go in. But I started to think\nabout why my phone was so sophisticated, yet so dumb.\n\nIt was then that I realized everything Smart was Dumb. My smartphone wasn\u2019t\nsmart. My smart speaker: to this day, a voice-activated kitchen timer is the\n#1 most utilized feature \u2014 not that smart. \u201cSmart\u201d technology is a big lie \u2014\nit\u2019s what we wish it was, but it\u2019s not.\n\nThe reason everything Smart is Dumb is: because the thing doesn't know me.\n\nWhat is it to know me?\n\nIf I were a very dedicated assistant, I would sit next to you and observe\neverything you did. I\u2019d start learning who you spend your time with, and what\nyou spend your time on, and observe your patterns and behaviors. I could begin\ninferring what you were trying to do (activities), and what you were like\n(attributes and characteristics). Just by standing next to you and shadowing\nyour work, I could learn a lot about you: who and what is important to you,\nand your patterns and behaviors.\n\nThat is what it is to know someone. My files are not me \u2014 what I do with them\nand who I work on them with is.\n\nThe door finally opens; I walk in and greet Bill and Nathan. Pleasantries\naside, they asked me: \u201cHey, we\u2019ve got tons of great ideas, but before we tell\nyou any of them, do you have any of your own?\"\n\nWell, as a matter of fact, I did. I proceeded to tell them how Smart Devices\nwere actually really Dumb (holding up my iPhone \u2013 that prompted a chuckle),\nbut I had an idea about how to make them \u2014 these dumb things labeled smart \u2014\nactually smart: by helping these things get to know me, in a radically\ndifferent way.\n\nI then told them how I could technically achieve it, to build an assistant\nthat could remember everything the user saw. And that's how Atlas Recall was\nborn: a product whose tagline was \u201cEverything Seen Is Remembered\u201d \u2014 real\nuniversal search, not the fake kind that we\u2019ve been sold. We built it, and it\nworked. And people loved it.\n\nThis explainer video we made for it six years ago speaks for itself:\n\nAtlas explainer video - 2016\n\nAt the time, we went to market as a search engine, as many apps have done and\nare still doing today. We had a robust strategy to build extra functionality \u2014\nrecommending things to you, doing things for you automatically \u2014 and while we\nhad a lot of work to do and a long road ahead, our initial product was\nprimarily focused on building a better search engine.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: nobody lays awake at night wondering how to buy search. This\nis a useful nugget of Truth I\u2019ve learned in my career: if the problem you\u2019re\nsolving isn\u2019t causing people to lose sleep at night, then it\u2019s not a solution\nthey will ultimately pay for in the long term.\n\nSo I'm more than convinced \u2014 with my own and others' experiences to back me up\n\u2014 that going to market as a search engine is a dead end. Search is table\nstakes that everybody wants, but in the mass market (which is where your head\nshould be at if you\u2019re trying to build a company), no one wants to pay for it.\n\nIt\u2019s helpful \u2014 don't get me wrong. We\u2019re inundated with information, and we\nhave tons of apps \u2014 but none of these apps talk to each other, and my\ninformation is scattered. We\u2019ve been living in the Great Data Diaspora of the\nInformation Age, thanks to this glorious thing we think of as the App\nEcosystem. But if I don't remember where the stuff I need is, most of the time\nI\u2019m not going to find it quickly. So yeah, we need a better way to search and\nfind things \u2014 and folks are having fun asking questions of ChatGPT and saying\nit's better than digging information out of Google \u2014 but people aren\u2019t laying\nawake at night wondering how to buy a product that does it.\n\nIn other words, the problem is consumers don\u2019t want to buy a better search\nengine \u2014 they don\u2019t want to have to find their data. Instead, what they need\nis to have their data find them \u2014 to surface in the context of whatever app\nthey're using, Augmenting their day-to-day tasks.\n\nI had yet to learn that lesson, so, even though we built a product that could\nrecall anything I\u2019d seen, it was probably too late. We went to market in\nOctober and tried to expand in the worst consumer growth time (Holidays). But\nthe hard truth is, even though we gained an impressive 15k users by April\ngrowing to 40k by July, we were still just going to be too early \u2014 the AI\ncapabilities we needed back then weren\u2019t developed enough. But we have the AI\ntechnology today.\n\nSo, while Atlas Informatics, the big bet that Bill Gates funded 10 years ago,\nwas destined to fail, my current company, Augment AI, will succeed today. Let\nme explain why.\n\nAtlas Recall is the foundation for what we have built at Augment AI. And we've\ntaken it much further, integrating it with the magic of AI to build\npersonalized foundation models. That vision I had 10 years ago of a digital\npersonal assistant following you across devices and applications, agnostic to\nplatforms and ecosystems, adapting to your unique workflow, is finally here.\n\nWhat makes us unique? Every other AI company is building solutions on top of\ngeneralized foundation models or building task-specific specialized models.\nWe're building personalized foundation models. Meaning: it's not just AI on\nyour apps; it's your AI.\n\nWe are the only ones who can call it truly personalized, thanks to our unique,\nhorizontal approach, which is applied to everything you see, across all your\napplications and devices. Allowing your AI to learn from you, anywhere and\neverywhere.\n\nI\u2019m pleased to introduce you to Augment, your real digital personal assistant\nin the Age of AI. Here\u2019s why you will want it:\n\n1) It\u2019s personalized to you, not only in tone and style but also by\nunderstanding the relationships between things and who and what is important\nto you. And it's always learning how to best assist you, simply by you doing\nwhat you normally do \u2014 no uploading or training necessary.\n\n2) It works across all of your tools, augmenting all of them, regardless of\nwhether they have APIs or not. A rising tide that lifts all apps.\n\n3) It\u2019s able to act like a second brain with perfect memory, remembering\neverything for you, especially the important details you tend to forget,\nenabling you to recall anything anytime, automatically distilling and\nsummarizing those things for you.\n\n4) It brings the missing context and smarts wherever it\u2019s needed, telling you\nthings you need to know when they\u2019re relevant, offering the right help at the\nright time.\n\n5) It understands you and how you work in such a way that it can begin your\nsentences for you - and finish your work.\n\nAnd it all started 10 years ago with a big bet by Bill Gates \u2014 a bet that,\nfrom what he's been writing recently, I think he\u2019d be happy to know is finally\npaying off.\n\nIf you want to experience the real power of AI, we\u2019re adding new users to our\nPrivate Beta every day.
