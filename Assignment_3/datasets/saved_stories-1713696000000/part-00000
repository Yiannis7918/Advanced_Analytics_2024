I fear the lack of them.\"\n\n\u2013 Isaac Asimov\n\n## Motivation \ud83e\udde0\n\nIf a component is to be calculated, it is generally possible to search the\nliterature for corresponding closed-form solutions in order to describe the\nphysical behaviour of a component by means of an equation.\n\nI-Beam - Analytical Solutions to this Problem Are Known!\n\nFor example, we can use the following analytical solution for an I-beam to\ncalculate the deflection:\n\nu=3EIFL3+2EIML2\n\nWhere I is the \"Second Moment of Area\":\n\nI=121(BH3\u2212bh3)\n\nI-Beam \u2013 Description of Beam Parameters\n\nAs I mentioned in my \"Beginner's Guide to FEM\"...whenever engineers solve\ncomplex problems involving complex geometries, loading conditions or material\nlaws, they cannot use classical analytical approaches using closed-form\nmethods.\n\nFEM offers a way to solve a problem where an analytical solution does not\nexist!\n\n## Introduction \ud83d\udc47\n\nWhenever we cannot use the aforementioned approach, we have to talk about\nnumerical methods such as the Finite Element Method (FEM) which discretises,\nor subdivides our domain into finite elements. We can call ourselves\nincredibly lucky that today's computer aided engineering (CAE) tools allow for\nautomatic mesh generation and solving these systems. We do not have to waste\nengineering brain power anymore on deriving equations for new problems and\nstart \"from scratch\", but can instead use FEA software tools that do the job\nfor us.\n\nSupport My Blog\n\nWe could technically derive the equations by simply taking the heat equation\nand deriving all equations from that one. From my experience teaching\nstudents, the easier approach is to describe the behaviour of a single bar\nelement and model it as a spring. The behaviour of each element generally\nrequires the development of partial differential equations (PDEs) for the\nproblem and formulation of its weak form. PDEs...weak form...?\n\nDon't worry. That's a bit of an advanced topic and will not be covered in this\nbeginner friendly piece. We derive the basic equations without considering\ngoverning partial differential equations, weak forms or any other fancy\nmethods.\n\nWe solely focus on deriving the equation for a single one-dimensional bar\nelement which will be the basis to derive and solve bigger systems. The\nfollowing approach will be used:\n\n1\\. Look at force equilibrium of the element \u2013 assume that the sum of the\nnodal internal forces acting on the element is equal to zero\n\n2\\. Apply Hooke\u2019s law, which states that the stress \u03c3 is a linear function of\nthe strain \u03b5\n\n\u03c3=E\u03b5\n\n3\\. Derive matrix for of the element stiffness matrix K that relates the force\nand displacement matrices\n\n4\\. ...Profit! \ud83d\ude80\n\n## Notation \u270d\ufe0f\n\n### Nomenclature of Elements & Nodes \ud83d\udcdd\n\nWhen talking about the FEM, a simple notation will be used to denote element\nand node numbers.\n\n  * Element numbers are denoted by superscripts\n  * Node numbers are denoted by subscripts\n\nWhen the variable is a vector with components in specific directions, the\ncomponent is given after the number. In any other case we assume that we mean\nthe global node number.\n\nExample:\n\nThe image below shows a simple version of one bar element. The first node is\non the left side, the second node on the right side, as indicated by the\nnaming of the displacement u. The element is kept general in this case but\nwill be renamed once we talk about bigger systems and need to distinguish\nbetween elements. It will also help you when we work on the \"matrix assembly\",\nso putting all matrices together to build a global matrix of all elements.\nStay tuned!\n\nExample of the Nomenclature\n\nTo reemphasise, for more complex cases where we have multiple elements in a\nsystem, u3x2 would mean that we talk about the displacement of node 3 at\nelement 2 in x direction \u2013 because multiple directions could be possible such\nas y, or if we talk about three dimensions, even z.\n\nIf that is not clear just yet, don't worry! You will understand it once we\ndeal with bigger systems that we are going to solve! \ud83d\ude42 It might seem annoying\nto do this but you will see that you understand the derivations much more\neasily if we do it in such a way.\n\nThe more familiar you become with the method, the less we will use this\nnotation as it will \"click\" at some point and you'll become more proficient in\nusing the method.\n\n### Force Convention \ud83d\udcc4\n\nWe distinguish internal axial forces (and stresses) as well as nodal internal\nforces. The internal force is positive in tension and negative in compression,\ni.e. the force is positive when it points out from the surface on which it is\nacting and the nodal internal forces are positive when they point in the\npositive x-direction.\n\nFree Body Diagram of a Single Bar Element\n\n## A Single Bar Element \u261d\ufe0f\n\nWe will model each of our homogeneous bar elements as a linear-elastic spring,\nsubjected to Hooke's law F=KU. We first note the correlation between normal\nForce N , the cross sectional area A and the uniaxial tensile stress \u03c3\n\n\u03c3=AN\n\nWith Hooke\u2019s law (\u03c3=E\u03b5) and the one dimensional distortion\n\n\u03b5=dxdu(x)=l0e\u0394le\n\nfollows that with the length variation \u0394le and the original length of the bar\nl0e and rearranging equation 2\n\nN=A\u03c3=AE\u03b5=AEl0e\u0394le\n\nor rewrite it simply to\n\nN=l0eEA\u0394le\n\nwhich finally gives us\n\nN=ke\u0394le\n\nWe call ke the element stiffness (sometimes called extensional stiffness) \u2013\nthe superscript e indicates that we refer to one single element only. The\nelongation \u0394le can be described as a function of displacements of the nodes of\na bar\n\n\u0394le=u2e\u2212u1e\n\nIf we apply the equilibrium condition on the bar, i.e. we take the sum of the\nforces applied on each node of the element and say they are equal to zero\n\nF1+F2=0\n\nWe now apply the same principle to the other free body diagram.\n\nWhat happens if we evaluate the equilibrium?\n\nThe left side gives us\n\nF1e+N=0\n\nor\n\nF1e=\u2212N\n\nWe do the same for the right side\n\nF2e\u2212N=0\n\nyielding F2e=N as N for the right side shows to the left, so is accounted for\nnegative!\n\n### Bringing Everything Together \ud83d\udcd6\n\nLet's now use everything we have so far.\n\nF2e=N=ke\u0394le=ke(u2e\u2212u1e)= keu2e\u2212keu1e\n\nWe do not have to do the same for F1e as we know from equation 10 that\n\nF1e=\u2212F2e\n\nThe force equilibrium in matrix notation (tensor notation) looks as follows\n\nFe=[F1eF2e]=[\u2212NN]=ke[1\u22121\u221211][u1eu2e]=Kede\n\nThe matrix Ke is called the element stiffness matrix. From a mathematical\npoint of view, this matrix is positive semi-definite which is symmetric with\nnon-negative eigenvalues.\n\nThe vector de is called the element displacement matrix and Fe the element\nforce matrix.\n\nThe stiffness matrix establishes the correlation between nodal displacements\nand nodal forces. Keep in mind that the matrix Ke is always singular which\nmeans the matrix is non-invertible and its determinant is zero.\n\nTo physically interpret the matrix singularity, imagine that our little bar is\nable to undergo rigid body motions and flow around in the universe as it is\nnot fixed yet. Or to formulate this more physically: We have not added\nboundary conditions yet!\n\nTo see that this is the case, you can simple add the rows of the stiffness\nmatrix and you will see that the equations are linearly dependent. When does\nthis happen? Whenever our system is statically under-determined!\n\nThe mathematical property of the matrix being positive semi-definite follows\nfrom the non-negativity of the deformation energy of our bar for arbitrary\nnodal displacements de (We have always mechanical input in our system. No\nmatter if it is tension or compression!)\n\nWe(de)=21(de)\u22a4Kede\u22650\n\nDon't worry. We will not need this equation. I simply wanted to put the\nequation here for completion and in case you want to look it up online...and\nalso because I seek external validation and think \"complex\" equations are\ncool.\n\nTo summarise, here's a simplified version of the formula we derived in matrix\nnotation.\n\n[K\u2212K\u2212KK][U1U2]=[F1F2]\n\nIf we write the same equation in the form of a symbolic representation, we\nreceive the renowned \"FEA Formula\".\n\nKU=F\n\n\ud83d\udc49 In the next blog, we will have a look at a simple arithmetic example and\ncover how we can add boundary conditions to statically under-determined\nsystems.\n\nIf this post was helpful to you, consider subscribing to receive the latest\nblogs, tutorials, code snippets and course updates! \ud83d\ude42\n\nAnd if you would love to see another topic on FEA, please leave a comment!\ud83d\udc47\n\nFEM Courses \ud83e\udde0\n\nKeep engineering your mind! \u2764\ufe0f\n\nJousef\n\n## Comments\n\n\u270d\ufe0f Sign in or become a member to leave comments.\n\n#### Browse Topics\n\nArtificial Intelligence \ud83e\udde0 Business \ud83d\udcbc Career \ud83d\udcc8 CFD \ud83d\udca6 Coding \ud83d\udcbb Engineering \ud83d\udc77\nExpert Interviews \ud83d\udcdd FEM \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f Fluid Mechanics \ud83d\udca6 Money \ud83d\udcb5 My Journal \u270d\ufe0f Notion \ud83c\udf31\nNotion Templates \ud83c\udf31\n\n###### ON THIS PAGE\n\n  1.
