For the more responsible\nreaders \u2013 aka \u201ceveryone but me\u201d \u2013 this was probably already done weeks \u2013 if\nnot months \u2013 ago. But don\u2019t worry. Taxes will roll around again the same time\nnext year, as inevitable as death itself as the famous philosopher noted, and\nour financial lives are year-round. So in other words, this is merely a good\nexcuse to discuss some ways that you can protect your financial life \u2013 both\nonline and off \u2013 and keep your funds, identity, and credit safe.\n\n## Protecting the Digital\n\nProtecting the digital side of your financial life works much the same as\nprotecting any other account. There are some universal constants, such as\nusing a password manager to generate and safely store strong, unique passwords\nand enabling the strongest form of two-factor authentication your various\naccounts and apps offer. On the topic of apps, I strongly advocate for digital\nminimalism. Do you really need Venmo and CashApp and Zelle and PayPal and so\non? Try to cut down on the number of apps and services you use to the fewest\nnumber possible. Not only will this be less to keep up with, it\u2019ll be safer.\nThe more services you\u2019re signed up for, the more opportunity for your data to\nget exposed in a data breach.\n\nBe sure to take a few minutes to do a quick threat assessment of the risks of\nyour setup. For example, do you use apps like Google Wallet or Apple Pay for\nquick payments? They may be convenient, but they also present a very real\nthreat of theft. Do you really save enough time to make it worth having those\nservices on your device? If so, how can you make sure to protect them against\nsuch threats? In some cases, the device may offer extra protection \u2013 Apple\nrecently rolled out Stolen Device Protection, for example, while some custom\nAndroid operating systems like Calyx and Graphene allow you to scramble your\nunlock PIN pad, making it harder for an on-looker to learn your PIN just based\non where you tap (the drawback there is that neither of those operating\nsystems support NFC \u201ctap to pay\u201d natively, but such tricks can protect other\nsensitive apps and information). Taking actions such as these \u2013 and others \u2013\ncan help keep your accounts and devices safer.\n\nFinally, be sure to tackle the low-hanging fruit: keep your apps and devices\nupdated, enable automatic updates wherever possible to make that easier, and\nbeware of phishing attempts \u2013 where people call, text, or email you attempting\nto get you to click a link, open an attachment, go to a website, or otherwise\nhand over personal data. Never do it. Go to the official website directly, or\nhang up and call back no matter how official or legitimate it seems. It may be\nannoying but those few seconds can save you a lot of grief down the road.\n\n## Protecting the Other-Than-Digital\n\nI would\u2019ve called this section \u201cProtecting the Offline,\u201d except that a lot of\nit involves digital services, so rather this is about protecting things that\nexpand beyond apps, accounts, and devices.\n\nI believe that every American (and probably many other people in other\ncountries, too) should freeze their credit. In America, it\u2019s free, and even\nthe most active reward-hacking personal finance nerd probably isn\u2019t applying\nfor new credit cards so often that the annoyance of logging in to temporarily\nunfreeze their credit is going to outweigh the security benefit.\n\nCredit reports have also become free on a weekly basis until further notice \u2013\nsurprisingly not by law, but because it became normalized during lockdown. You\nprobably don\u2019t need to be checking your credit reports every week, but you\nshould probably check at least every few months for any unfamiliar charges or\nmistakes. In addition to having the chance to correct them and fix your credit\nscore, it also offers you the opportunity to detect any possible fraud or\nleaks in your security early before the damage gets out of control.\n\nI also strongly encourage the use of cash and masked payment options wherever\npossible. The benefits of cash have been well-known for ages: you can\u2019t skim\ncash, and it helps you stick to your budget because once the wallet (or\nenvelope) is empty, you\u2019re done (there's also a psychological component that\nmakes spending cash harder than swiping a card for most people). Masked\npayments can help if your card ever gets stolen online: you still have access\nto your normal card to withdraw cash and go about your daily life while the\ndigital one can be easily replaced. My personal favorite is Privacy.com as it\ncomes with extra features like the ability to lock a card to a vendor (so if\nyour Netflix card gets stolen it can\u2019t be used for an Amazon shopping spree,\nfor example) and the ability to set limits (so your phone company can\u2019t\novercharge you) but really anything that helps provide that layer of\nprotection is an improvement.\n\nFinally, don\u2019t forget that when you do file taxes each year, you can request\nan Identity Protection PIN from the IRS that will help make it harder for\nsomeone to file taxes in your name and steal your refund. You\u2019ll need to\nrequest one each year, but they\u2019re worth it since it only takes a few minutes\nand offers yet another layer of protection.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that nothing is unhackable. Doing these things will\nmake your financial life and identity a lot more secure, but I don\u2019t want to\nlull anyone into a false sense of security. The goal is not to be perfectly\nsecure, but rather to create just enough obstacles that the attackers give up\nand go somewhere else. Following these tips will create a strong, reasonable\nlayer of security around your financial life and make you a less appealing\ntarget.\n\nYou can find more recommended services and programs at TheNewOil.org, and you\ncan find our other content across the web here or support our work in a\nvariety of ways here.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
