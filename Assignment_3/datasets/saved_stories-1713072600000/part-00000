Ten turned us down on\ncybersecurity grounds.\n\nApril 13, 2024 06:00 ET\n\nAll of these students saw the same message in their web browsers as they tried\nto complete their work: \u201cThe site you have requested has been blocked because\nit does not comply with the filtering requirements as described by the\nChildren\u2019s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) or Rockwood School District.\u201d\n\nCIPA, a federal law passed in 2000, requires schools seeking subsidized\ninternet access to keep students from seeing obscene or harmful images\nonline\u2014especially porn.\n\nSchool districts all over the country, like Rockwood in the western suburbs of\nSt. Louis, go much further, limiting not only what images students can see but\nwhat words they can read. Records obtained from 16 districts in 11 different\nstates show just how broadly schools block content, forcing students to jump\nthrough hoops to complete assignments and keeping them from resources that\ncould support their health and safety.\n\nCaption: Lafayette High School is part of the Rockwood School District, which\nuses web-filtering software that block students from accessing certain\ncontent. Credit:Tara Garc\u00eda Mathewson\n\nSome of the censorship inhibits the ability to do basic research on sites like\nWikipedia and Quora. Students have been blocked from going to websites that\nweb-filtering software categorizes as \u201ceducation,\u201d \u201cnews,\u201d or \u201cinformational.\u201d\nBut even more concerning, especially for some students who spoke with The\nMarkup, are blocks against sex education, abortion information, and resources\nfor LGBTQ+ teens\u2014including suicide prevention.\n\nVirtually all school districts buy web filters from companies that sort the\ninternet into categories. Districts decide which categories to block, often\nmaking those selections without a complete understanding of the universe of\nwebsites under each label\u2014information that the filtering companies consider\nproprietary. This necessarily leads to overblocking, and The Markup found that\ndistricts routinely have to create new, custom categories to allow certain\nwebsites on a case-by-case basis. Students and teachers, meanwhile, suffer the\nconsequences of overzealous filtering.\n\nThe filters did sometimes keep students from seeing pornographic images, but\nfar more often they kept students from playing online games, browsing social\nmedia, and using the internet for legitimate academic work. Records from the\n16 districts include blocks that students wouldn\u2019t necessarily notice,\nrepresenting just elements of a page, like an ad or an image, rather than the\nentire site, but they reveal that districts\u2019 filters collectively logged over\n1.9 billion blocks in just a month.\n\n### 1.9 billion\n\nBlocks of web pages and page elements recorded in the course of a month by 16\nschool districts surveyed by The Markup.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re basically trapped in this bubble, and they\u2019re deciding what we can and\ncan\u2019t see,\u201d said 18-year-old Ali Siddiqui, a senior at a San Francisco Bay\nArea high school.\n\nThe Markup requested records from 26 school districts. Many we selected\nbecause they had made headlines for banning library books; others we chose\nbecause government records showed they had purchased web filters or because\nthey were mentioned by students interviewed for this article. Although 10\ndistricts did not release the records\u2014almost all claiming it would compromise\ntheir cybersecurity\u2014we were still able to compile one of the most\ncomprehensive datasets yet showing how U.S. schools censor the internet.\n\nThe blocks raise questions about whether schools\u2019 online censorship runs afoul\nof constitutional law and federal guidance. The Markup\u2019s investigation\nrevealed that some districts, including Rockwood, continue to block content\nthat\u2019s supportive of LGBTQ+ teens while leaving anti-LGBTQ+ content\naccessible, something a Missouri court ruled was unconstitutional over a\ndecade ago. What\u2019s more, many districts completely block social media sites,\nsomething the Federal Communications Commission said in 2011 was inconsistent\nwith CIPA.\n\nThe districts examined by The Markup varied significantly in what they\nblocked. While many districts blocked YouTube and most blocked social media,\nonly a handful blocked sex education websites.\n\nCatherine Ross, professor emeritus of law at George Washington University and\nauthor of a book on school censorship, called the blocks \u201ca very serious\nconcern\u2014particularly for those whose only access is through sites that are\ncontrolled by the school,\u201d whether that access is limited because they can\u2019t\nafford it at home or simply can\u2019t get it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re setting up a system in which students, by the accident of geography,\nare getting very different kinds of education,\u201d Ross said. \u201cDo we really want\nthat to be the case? Is that fair?\u201d\n\n> We\u2019re setting up a system in which students, by the accident of geography,\n> are getting very different kinds of education.\n>\n> Catherine Ross, professor emeritus of law, George Washington University\n\nSurvey data show how these inequities play out. The Center for Democracy and\nTechnology asked teachers last year whether internet filtering and blocking\ncan make it harder for students to complete assignments. Among teachers in\nschools with high rates of poverty, 62 percent said yes; among teachers in\nschools with lower rates, 50 percent said the same.\n\nThough banned books get more attention than blocked websites in schools, some\ngroups are fighting back. Students in Texas are supporting a state law that\nwould limit what schools can censor, and the American Library Association\nhosts Banned Websites Awareness Day each fall. The ACLU continues to fight the\nissue at the local level more than a decade after wrapping up its national\n\u201cDon\u2019t Filter Me\u201d campaign against school web blocks of resources for the\nLGBTQ+ community. Yet as the culture wars play out in U.S. schools, Brian\nKlosterboer, an attorney with the ACLU of Texas, said there are signs the\nproblem is getting worse. \u201cI\u2019m worried there\u2019s a lot more content filtering\nreemerging.\u201d\n\n\u21a9\ufe0e link\n\n### Explore the sites schools blocked\n\n#### The sites below appeared in records obtained from five school districts\nin four states.

As someone who\nidentifies as queer, she was particularly interested in the transgender\ncommunity\u2019s battle for civil rights. Steldt, now a sophomore, remembers having\nto do much of her research on her phone to get around the district\u2019s web\nfilter.\n\nDigital Book Banning\n\n### Five High Schoolers Describe the Dangers and Frustrations of Censored Web\nAccess\n\nTheir schools block information about The Trevor Project, abortion,\nmicroplastics, and more\n\nApril 13, 2024 06:00 ET\n\nShe also remembers that one of her teachers that year had a poster on her wall\nabout The Trevor Project, whose site offers suicide prevention resources\nspecifically for LGBTQ+ young people. The teacher wanted students to know her\nroom was a safe space and that there was help available.\n\nBut the Rockwood web filter blocks The Trevor Project for middle schoolers,\nmeaning that Steldt couldn\u2019t have accessed it on the school network. Same for\nIt Gets Better, a global nonprofit that aims to uplift and empower LGBTQ+\nyouth, and The LGBTQ+ Victory Fund, which supports openly LGBTQ+ candidates\nfor public office nationwide. At the same time, the filter allows Rockwood\nstudents to see anti-LGBTQ+ information online from fundamentalist Christian\ngroup Focus on the Family and the Alliance Defending Freedom, a legal\nnonprofit the Southern Poverty Law Center labeled an anti-LGBTQ+ hate group in\n2016.\n\nCaption: The Rockwood school district\u2019s web filter blocks students from\naccessing the It Gets Better website, a nonprofit that aims to empower LGBTQ+\nyouth.\n\nBob Deneau, the school district\u2019s chief information officer, said his\ndepartment works with teachers to determine the curricular benefit of\nunblocking certain categories. \u201cWhen we look at it, we say, \u2018Is there\neducational purpose?\u2019\u201d he explained.\n\n> The policy is to block first and only unblock in the face of a compelling\n> case.\n\nThe policy is to block first and only unblock in the face of a compelling\ncase.\n\nRockwood did unblock some LGBTQ+ sites for high schoolers, including The\nTrevor Project and It Gets Better, in response to individual requests, but\nthey remain blocked for middle and elementary schoolers, and the district\nrecords listed some thwarted attempts to visit the sites.\n\nRockwood School District gets its web-filtering platform, ContentKeeper, from\na company called Impero, which, in 2021, was reportedly used by over 300\nschool districts in the U.S. One of its filter categories is called \u201chuman\nsexuality,\u201d and it captures informational resources, support websites, and\nentertainment news designed for the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nEven though the ACLU\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Filter Me\u201d campaign, launched in 2011, urged\nfiltering companies to get rid of LGBTQ+ categories, The Markup investigation\nfound that ContentKeeper and a filter from a company called Securly both still\nuse them. Securly is one of the most popular web filters, used in more than\n20,000 schools, and its \u201csexual content\u201d category covers \u201cwebsites about\nsexual health and LGBTQ+ advocacy websites.\u201d Despite the category name, it is\nnot designed to include porn.\n\nCredit:Securly; annotation by The Markup\n\nCaption: The \u201csexual content\u201d category for the web filter Securly.\n\nTwo other filtering companies represented in The Markup\u2019s dataset, iboss and\nLightspeed, removed similar categories in response to the ACLU campaign.\nLightspeed says it serves 28,000 schools globally; while iboss doesn\u2019t offer\nschool-specific numbers, it works with more than 4,000 organizations\nworldwide.\n\nThe ACLU campaign didn\u2019t focus only on filtering companies. It also pressured\ndistricts to unblock the categories themselves. Missouri\u2019s Camdenton R-III\nSchool District refused, and the ACLU took it to court. Attorneys argued the\ndistrict\u2019s filter amounted to viewpoint discrimination, blocking access to\nsupportive LGBTQ+ information while allowing access to anti-LGBTQ+ sites. They\nwon.\n\nYet complaints have continued. Cameron Samuels first encountered blocks to\nLGBTQ+ web pages during the 2018\u201319 school year while working on a class\nproject as a ninth grader in Texas\u2019 Katy Independent School District. Like\nRockwood, Katy uses ContentKeeper to filter the web; to Samuels, the LGBTQ+\ncategory of blocks felt like a personal attack. Not only did Samuels find that\nthe LGBTQ+ news source The Advocate was blocked, the teen also couldn\u2019t visit\nThe Trevor Project.\n\n\u201cThe district was blocking access to potentially lifesaving resources for me\nand my LGBT identity,\u201d Samuels said.\n\nCaption: Cameron Samuels was blocked by Katy Independent School District\u2019s\ninternet filter from visiting The Trevor Project.\n\nBy senior year, Samuels was ready to challenge the whole filter category,\nhaving gained confidence and experience in community organizing. The ACLU of\nTexas got involved, helping Samuels file a grievance with Katy ISD. District\nadministrators ruled against them, but the school board ruled in Samuels\u2019\nfavor on appeal, unblocking the entire \u201chuman sexuality\u201d category for high\nschoolers.\n\n> The district was blocking access to potentially lifesaving resources for me\n> and my LGBT identity.\n>\n> Cameron Samuels, graduate of Katy Independent School District in Texas\n\nStill, the category remains blocked for younger students, and Anne Russey\nwants to change that. A mom of two elementary schoolers in Katy ISD and a\nprofessional therapist for LGBTQ+ adults, Russey first filed tech support\ntickets to ask for individual websites to be unblocked. After being denied,\nshe escalated her fight through the same grievance process Samuels took, but\nthe school board would not unblock The Trevor Project in its elementary\nschools. Seeing no further recourse locally, Russey also filed a\ndiscrimination complaint with the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Office for\nCivil Rights, and that case remains open.\n\n\u201cMy biggest fear is that we lose a student as a result of this filter,\u201d she\nsaid. The Trevor Project estimates that at least one LGBTQ+ person between the\nages of 13 and 24 attempts suicide every 45 seconds.\n\n\u201cOn a less catastrophic level,\u201d Russey said, \u201ckids do start to figure out who\nthey are attracted to in these upper elementary grades.\u201d If kids want to\nexplore LGBTQ+ information, thinking they might identify as part of that\ncommunity, they would only be able to access negative information on school\ncomputers.\n\n\u21a9\ufe0e link\n\n### Appealing censorship\n\nDistrict| State| Can students appeal blocked sites?  \n---|---|---  \nBeaufort County School District| South Carolina| No  \nFort Worth Independent School District| Texas| No  \nGranite School District| Utah| No  \nHouston Independent School District| Texas| No  \nJefferson Parish Schools| Louisiana| No  \nParadise Valley Unified School District| Arizona| No  \nSchool District of Manatee County| Florida| No  \nSchool District of Palm Beach County| Florida| No  \nSeattle Public Schools| Washington| No  \nTexarkana Independent School District| Texas| No  \nForsyth County Schools| Georgia| Not directly  \nWashington County School District| Utah| Not directly  \nWentzville School District| Missouri| Not directly  \nPleasant Valley School District| Pennsylvania| Yes  \nRockwood School District| Missouri| Yes  \nWilliston Basin School District #7| North Dakota| Yes  \n  \nDistricts are those that provided records for this story.

But research often proves nearly impossible on her school\ncomputer. She recently sought out information for a presentation about health\ncare disparities and abortion access.\n\n\u201cPage after page was just blocked, blocked, blocked,\u201d Perez said. \u201cIt\u2019s\nchallenging to find accurate information a lot of times.\u201d\n\n> Page after page was just blocked, blocked, blocked.\n>\n> Maya Perez, senior in the Forth Worth Independent School District in Texas\n\nShe resorted to looking things up on her phone and then typing notes into her\ncomputer, which was \u201creally inefficient,\u201d she said. \u201cI just wish I had access\nto more news sites and informational sites.\u201d\n\nIn response to a request for records of blocked websites through November, the\nFort Worth Independent School District released only two days\u2019 worth of\nblocking, showing the five most frequently blocked domains (Spotify, Facebook,\nTikTok, Roku, and Instagram) as well as a list of categories blocked.\n\u201cAbortion\u201d did not show up as a blocked category, but search engines were\nblocked more than 4,500 times, education websites were blocked about 3,800\ntimes, and news websites were blocked 648 times.\n\nPlanned Parenthood affiliates around the country end up negotiating directly\nwith local school districts to unblock their website, according to Julia\nBennett, the nonprofit\u2019s senior director of digital education and learning\nstrategy. Some schools say yes, some no.\n\nDigital Book Banning\n\n### Students: Investigate Internet Censorship in Your School District\n\nVirtually every public school filters the web, and blocked websites create a\npaper trail\n\nApril 13, 2024 06:00 ET\n\nAlison Macklin spent almost 20 years as a sex educator in Colorado; at the end\nof her lessons she would tell students that they could find more information\nand resources on plannedparenthood.org. \u201cKids would say, \u2018No, I can\u2019t, miss,\u2019\u201d\nshe remembered. She now serves as the policy and advocacy director for SIECUS,\na national nonprofit advocating for sex education.\n\nOnly 29 states and the District of Columbia require sex education, according\nto SIECUS\u2019 legislative tracking. Missouri is not one of them. The Rockwood and\nWentzville school districts in Missouri were among those The Markup found to\nbe blocking sex education websites. The Markup also identified blocks to sex\neducation websites, including Planned Parenthood, in Florida, Utah, Texas, and\nSouth Carolina.\n\nIn Manatee County, Florida, students aren\u2019t the only ones who can\u2019t access\nthese sites \u2014 district records show teachers are blocked from sex education\nwebsites too.\n\n\u21a9\ufe0e link\n\n## The Breadth of the Internet\n\nLike Perez, Rockwood School District sophomore Brooke O\u2019Dell most frequently\nruns into blocked websites when doing homework. Sometimes she can\u2019t access\nPDFs she wants to read. Her workaround is to pull out her phone, find the\nwebpage using her own cellular data, navigate to the file she wants, email it\nto herself, and then go back to her school-issued Chromebook to open it. When\nit\u2019s website text she\u2019s interested in, O\u2019Dell uses the Google Drive app on her\nphone to copy-and-paste text into a Google Doc that she can later access from\nher Chromebook. She recently had to do this while working on a literary\ncriticism project about the book \u201cJane Eyre.\u201d\n\n\u21a9\ufe0e link\n\n### If you are a student...\n\nYou can test the filtering at your school by logging on to your campus Wi-Fi\nand taking our quiz-style survey.\n\nTell us which sites are blocked or just post your results on social media with\na personalized image.\n\nRead more\n\nRecounting her frustration, O\u2019Dell bristled at the need for any web filter at\nall.\n\n\u201cWhile you\u2019re in school, they are in charge of you,\u201d she said, \u201cbut that\ndoesn\u2019t mean they need to control everything you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nIn Forsyth County Schools in Georgia, which blocks a relatively narrow set of\ncategories, records obtained by The Markup reveal a spate of blocked YouTube\nvideos: One video shows a person reading a novel about Pablo Picasso. Another,\na clip of Picasso himself painting. A third is an analysis of the painting\n\u201cGuernica,\u201d and a final one describes Picasso\u2019s life and impact. Besides\ninhibiting Picasso research, the filter stopped other internet users in the\ndistrict from history videos, a physics lesson, videos of zoo animals, and\nchildren\u2019s songs about the seasons and days of the week.\n\nAmong the 16 districts that released records about their blocked websites, 13\nshared the categories tied to the blocks. Games and social media were the most\nfrequently blocked categories, along with ads, entertainment, audio and video\ncontent, and search engines.\n\nSites labeled \u201cporn\u201d or \u201cnudity\u201d didn\u2019t crack the top 10 categories blocked in\nany district. Only in Palm Beach County, Florida, and Seattle were they even\nin the top 20.\n\n> Internet users in the School District of Manatee County, in Florida, were\n> blocked from accessing dictionary websites, Google Scholar, academic\n> journals, church websites, and a range of news outlets.\n\nThe School District of Manatee County blocks its internet more broadly than\nalmost any other district The Markup analyzed. Internet users in Manatee were\nblocked from accessing dictionary websites, Google Scholar, academic journals,\nchurch websites, and a range of news outlets, including Teen Vogue, Fox News,\nand a Tampa Bay TV station, according to the records. Manatee\u2019s chief\ntechnology officer, Scott Hansen, said many of those websites are available to\nstudents and staffers but not guests on the district\u2019s network, such as\noutside students working on homework during downtime over long sports\ntournaments or other events. Still, Manatee students can\u2019t access the local\npublic library catalog; most social media platforms; or sites with audio and\nvideo content including Fox Nation, Spotify, and SoundCloud.\n\nAs Deneau explained in the Rockwood School District, Hansen described a\nfiltering policy in Manatee that errs on the side of blocking. If a category\nisn\u2019t seen as having an explicit educational purpose, it is blocked.\n\n## Report Deeply and Fix Things\n\nBecause it turns out moving fast and breaking things broke some super\nimportant things.\n\nGive Now\n\nHansen started working in school district IT before CIPA required filters. \u201cIn\nthe early days, they were all terrible,\u201d he said. \u201cThey created lots of\nchallenges, but their intent was good and they were needed.\u201d Now, by contrast,\nHansen said the most widely used filters do a good job of properly\ncategorizing the internet, which limits the complaints he hears from teachers;\nfew instructors actually request that sites get unblocked.\n\nWhile that may be true, interviews with students and teachers around the\ncountry indicate many of them have simply resigned themselves to being kept\nfrom much of the internet. Students don\u2019t necessarily know they can ask that\nsites get unblocked, and many who do make the request have been denied. The\noverarching rationale for the filters\u2014keeping students safe\u2014seems\nunimpeachable, so few people try to fight them. And schools, after all, have\nthe right to limit what they make available online. CIPA lets the FCC refuse\ninternet subsidies to school districts that don\u2019t filter out porn, but the law\ndoesn\u2019t identify any consequence for excessive filtering, giving districts\nwide latitude to make their own decisions.\n\nIn the Center for Democracy and Technology\u2019s survey, nearly three-quarters of\nstudents said web filters make it hard to complete assignments. Even\naccounting for youthful exaggeration, 57 percent of teachers said the same was\ntrue for their students.\n\n> Kristin Woelfel at the Center for Democracy and Technology started to think\n> of the web filters as a \u2018digital book ban,\u2019 an act of censorship that\u2019s as\n> troubling as a physical book ban but far less visible.\n\nKristin Woelfel, a policy counsel at CDT, said she and her colleagues started\nto think of the web filters as a \u201cdigital book ban,\u201d an act of censorship\nthat\u2019s as troubling as a physical book ban but far less visible. \u201cYou can see\nwhether a book is on a shelf,\u201d she said. By contrast, decisions about which\nwebsites or categories to block happen under the radar.\n\nWhen Rockwood started using ContentKeeper a few years ago, O\u2019Dell noticed that\nthe filtering became more restrictive. While she recognizes that the blocking\nprevents students from playing games on their computers, she doesn\u2019t believe\ntechnology should play that role.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not really teaching kids the responsibility of when to pay attention in\nclass,\u201d she said. \u201cIt kind of just takes that entire part of learning\ncompletely away.\u201d\n\n\u21a9\ufe0e link\n\n## A Stubborn Status Quo\n\nThe American Library Association has been calling for a more nuanced approach\nto filtering the internet in schools and libraries since 2003, when it failed\nto convince the Supreme Court that CIPA is unconstitutional. In that case, the\nALA argued that the filters violate public library patrons\u2019 right to receive\ninformation, a constitutional protection legal scholars trace back to the\n1940s. The Supreme Court has upheld the concept multiple times since then,\narguing that the First Amendment protects not only the right to speak but the\nright to receive information and ideas. In the 2003 case, however, the Supreme\nCourt ruled that, as long as people 17 and older could request a website be\nunblocked, the filters did not unduly limit internet users\u2019 constitutional\nrights.\n\nThough CIPA makes clear that school districts only have to block a narrow\nsliver of the internet, it does leave schools with the power to determine what\nelse is inappropriate for their students. In 2010, the U.S. Department of\nEducation lamented that filters put up barriers \u201cto the rich learning\nexperiences that in-school Internet access should afford students.\u201d Shortly\nafter the Department of Education complained about the law\u2019s impact, the FCC\nemphasized that school districts should not set up blanket blocks on social\nmedia websites.\n\nDigital Book Banning\n\n### Does Your School Block These Sites?\n\nIf you are a K-12 student, help extend our internet censorship investigation\nby connecting to your school\u2019s wifi and clicking on websites to test them.\n\nApril 13, 2024 06:00 ET\n\nYet in more than a decade, districts have had no additional federal guidance\nabout what they owe students online. And the Markup investigation showed that\nmany districts are flouting the limited existing guidelines; almost all\ndistricts blocked some social media sites in their entirety. And only three\nout of 16 school districts analyzed by The Markup let students directly\nrequest sites be unblocked. Deborah Caldwell-Stone, director of the ALA\u2019s\nOffice for Intellectual Freedom, said schools that refuse to field such\nrequests are potentially infringing on students\u2019 constitutional rights.\n\nCaldwell-Stone called CIPA \u201ca handy crutch\u201d for censorship that is not\njustified by the law. \u201cThe FCC makes it clear that it\u2019s not [justified], but\nthere\u2019s no remedy for the kind of activity other than going to court,\u201d she\nsaid, which is too expensive and time-consuming for many families.\n\nLawsuits also have limited reach, often changing behavior in only one small\npart of the country at a time. Rockwood School District has a filter doing\nwhat the ACLU sued Camdenton for over a decade ago and the two districts are\nin the same state, just 150 miles apart. Battling discrimination carried out\nvia web filters is like a game of whack-a-mole in a nation where much of the\ndecision-making is left to more than 13,000 individual school districts.\n\n> The American Library Association\u2019s Deborah Caldwell-Stone called CIPA \u2018a\n> handy crutch\u2019 for censorship that is not justified by the law.\n\nBob Deneau, the chief information officer at Rockwood, said he wasn\u2019t aware of\nthe Camdenton case or that the district\u2019s filter policies might be a legal\nliability.\n\nAnd besides the cases where filters explicitly block one viewpoint while\nallowing another\u2014as with LGBTQ+-related content in Rockwood and Katy\u2014the\nquestion of what students have a right to see is only getting murkier. In 2023\nalone, the American Library Association tracked challenges to more than 9,000\nbooks in school libraries nationwide.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. Schools could use the wide latitude the\nFCC leaves them to take a more hands-off approach to web filtering. In\nGeorgia\u2019s Forsyth County, where books have been banned from school libraries,\nMike Evans, the district\u2019s chief technology and information officer, said\nwebsites have not been involved in the controversy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll always have different families on one side or another,\u201d Evans said.\n\u201cSome would rather have things more restricted if they don\u2019t agree with any\nLGBTQ-type material or video that might be available, but we try to stay away\nfrom that type of [filtering] altogether.\u201d\n\nForsyth County Schools does not have a block category for LGBTQ+ resources.\n\nIn Texas, meanwhile, Katy ISD grad Cameron Samuels co-founded Students Engaged\nin Advancing Texas to fight for open access to information statewide. The\ngroup supported a bill, introduced by state Rep. Jon Rosenthal last year, that\nwould prohibit schools from blocking websites with resources for students\nabout human trafficking, interpersonal or domestic violence, sexual assault,\nor mental health and suicide prevention for LGBTQ+ individuals. It didn\u2019t go\nanywhere, but Samuels hopes it will in the future\u2014especially because new board\nmembers in Katy ISD could mean the websites Samuels fought so hard to unblock\nget blocked once again.\n\n\u201cCensorship,\u201d Samuels said grimly, \u201cis a winning issue right now.\u201d\n\nYour donations power our award-winning reporting and our tools.
