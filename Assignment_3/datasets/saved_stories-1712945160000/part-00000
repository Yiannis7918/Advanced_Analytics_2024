You'll also be able to access these\nfeatures on more devices, including Pixel tablets.\n\nHere\u2019s a closer look at some of these editing tools, and how they can spruce\nup your photos:\n\nItem 1 of 3\n\n  * The before and after effects of using Photo Unblur to sharpen a photo of three people\n\nPhoto Unblur: Clear up those blurry shots to relive your favorite moments with\ngreater clarity.\n\n  * The before and after effects of using Magic Eraser to remove a trash can in the background of a photo with two children.\n\nMagic Eraser: Remove photobombers and other distractions with a few taps.\n\n  * The before and after effects of using Portrait Light to help brighten a photo of two people with a scenic background.\n\nPortrait light: Adjust the position and brightness of light in portraits.\n\n## Make complex edits with Magic Editor\n\nLast year, we launched Magic Editor on Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro.
