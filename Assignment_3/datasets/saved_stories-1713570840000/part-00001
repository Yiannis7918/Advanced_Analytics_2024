It\u2019s still early, we know. It\u2019s difficult to imagine\nthe state of security in the future when companies aren\u2019t even sure how they\nmight use AI or what the underlying infrastructure might look like.\n\nYet when we asked these top minds gathered over a dinner in New York, the\nconsensus was that AI will have a greater impact on security than even the\ncloud. While most enterprises are only in the piloting phase (if they\u2019re even\nthat far), these CISOs at the forefront of AI planning were certain it would\nreshape their workflow.\n\n\u201cInitially, AI will lower the cost for hackers to launch attacks, but security\nteams will soon use AI to increase the cost of attacks, rendering most common\nattacks obsolete,\u201d said one participant. Another added, \u201cAI will automate a\nlot of the manual processes in security.\u201d The main point these top security\nleaders voiced was acceptance of the AI revolution, even as they grappled with\nmany open questions about the best way to prepare.\n\nIt\u2019s clear only in retrospect that the transition from on-premise computing to\nthe cloud would dramatically upend the lineup of players dominating the\nsecurity sector. The move from on-prem to the cloud began in the late 2000s,\nbut it wasn\u2019t until 2014 or 2015 that large enterprises fully embraced the\nidea. For all AI\u2019s expected impact on the enterprise, until we better\nunderstand its infrastructure. We make sense of its impact on our software\ndelivery and operational practices by drawing parallels to traditional devops\nand software engineering. Surprisingly, many of the surveyed CIOs shared that\nthey have no immediate intention to adjust their approach to security due to\nAI innovation, even though they primarily agreed that AI will fundamentally\nreshape security tooling much like the cloud. Most security approaches we see\ntoday are reactive\u2014understand user behavior first and then fix the after-\neffects\u2014but AI will likely need a more proactive protective stance.\n\nWe surveyed 41 CISOs prior to our New York dinner. All agreed that their\norganizations, to the extent they were implementing AI, needed to implement it\nsecurely. Yet some saw no need to purchase additional products. They believe\nthat augmenting their existing security software tools will be adequate.\nOthers understand that AI will invariably spark new security purchases,\nincluding the need for new firewalls to contain LLMs and enable secure data\nretrieval through RAG.\n\nThe CISOs surveyed, representing Fortune 100s and unicorn startups alike,\nindicated that spending on software security will continue to grow despite\nbelt-tightening in other areas. After increasing by an average of 9 percent in\n2023, their spending on software security is expected to grow by another 10\npercent in 2024. This is modestly outpacing the average growth of overall\nsoftware spending.\n\nKeeping up with rapid AI innovations is quickly becoming a top priority for\nsecurity teams. Take email phishing, one of the primary methods attackers use\nto infiltrate organizations. Now, attackers can leverage open-source LLMs that\nspit out a -infinite number of natural-sounding phishing emails. Enterprises\nmay be adopting a cautious attitude toward adopting AI, but that\u2019s unlikely\ntrue for those seeking to harness it for ill gain.\n\n\u201cMost of the impact will be negative,\u201d the CISO at one company with a security\nbudget north of $20 million told us. For years, organizations have taught\nemployees to look for obvious grammatical errors to determine if an email is\nsuspicious. That is no longer enough.\n\n## AI threats as opportunities\n\nYet, of course, the concerns expressed by the CISOs we spoke with can also\nrepresent an opportunity for enterprising founders. Below are some of the key\ntakeaways from our survey:\n\n#### (1) Email security ranked as a top five priority in 2024.\n\nCISOs are unhappy with the incumbents they\u2019ve been relying upon for email\nsecurity, which provides an opportunity for disruption. Phishing attacks will\nundoubtedly become more advanced using AI, pushing security teams to evolve in\nthe ever-ongoing cat-and-mouse game. Companies currently leading in this area,\nsuch as Proofpoint and Mimecast, came up numerous times in our surveys as\noffering products that left users feeling disappointed. That\u2019s provided an\nopportunity for companies like Sublime and Abnormal, which are applying AI to\nhelp secure inboxes and provide customizable solutions for CISOs.\n\n#### (2) Identity management, for both human and non-human accounts, is a top\nconcern.\n\nIn addition to needing to consistently and accurately verify human identity,\nthe adoption of AI portends a far greater reliance on machine-to-machine\ninteractions without human intervention. Investing in new non-human identity\nsolutions to better secure APIs, keys, tokens, and eventually AI Agents is the\nnext evolution of Zero Trust security and an area that requires investment.\nCISOs surveyed most commonly cited non-human identity (which can consist of\nAPI and machine identity) as the top security pain point that needs a\nsatisfactory solution. Non-human identities were often overlooked\nhistorically, but are now front and center. This on all facets of identity are\nwhy companies pursuing parts of the identity stack like ConductorOne, Oso\n(both Felicis investments) and Clutch are seeing a lot of interest from\nsecurity teams.\n\n#### (3) Security operations will incorporate AI and require better data.\n\nThe use of autonomous SecOps copilots means more automated and autonomous\noperations. But AI is only as good as the quality of the data\u2014the SIEM\u2014beneath\nthese autonomous agents. SIEM came up as a top priority and a place where\nCISOs are hungry for a better solution, and incumbents scored very low NPS\nnumbers. New concepts such as Security Data Fabric and additional data layers\nto lower SIEM bills are also top of mind. In the SecOps layer, companies still\ncrave solutions like Tines (a Felicis investment) to automate human processes\nacross multiple systems and view this area as ripe for AI Security Copilots\nand Agents.\n\n#### (4) AI can potentially upend the sizable pen testing & services market.\n\nSome CISOs we spoke with indicated that pen testing and other red team\nactivities would account for as much as 25 percent of their total security\nbudget in 2024. While other CISOs found that allocation surprisingly high, it\nsuggests a meaningful opportunity for a new generation of AI-powered pen\ntesting products. For instance, while many existing pen testing solutions\nautomate numerous processes, they still often require the heavy presence of a\nhuman in the loop. Newer solutions have the opportunity to take automation to\na much higher level and help reduce the human cost of pen testing.\n\n## Another paradigm shift in the offing?\n\nThere are reasons to suspect that AI\u2019s impact will be bigger and more\ndisruptive than the move to the cloud. AI adds both complexity and quantity to\nany attack and allows attackers to move lightning-fast. In the past,\nautomation has been nice to have. Automation now seems mandatory for many\nfronts of an enterprise\u2019s defenses.\n\nThat\u2019s good news for the team behind Tines, the only early-stage company that\nCISOs mentioned multiple times when asked to name their top vendors. One\nrespondent described Tines, a platform that helps security teams automate more\nof their processes, as \u201cthe kind of tool that makes other tools in the stack\nand our team better.\u201d\n\nAccess to sensitive internal data had long been a top concern but now CISOs\nmust throw AI into the mix. Some models are internal-facing, but many are\nexternal-facing products, which raises serious governance and privacy\nconcerns. An organization can\u2019t just throw AI on top of something and let the\nmodel figure out what it crawls. This is why we were excited to invest in Dig,\na cloud data security platform recently acquired by Palo Alto Networks (PANW).\nGiven PANW\u2019s history of smart acquisitions, this shows an increasing awareness\nby major players of how crucial data security is to the next generation of\ncomputing.\n\nFounders wondering where to start building should consider where CISOs are\nmost dissatisfied. Our survey reveals that incumbent vendors with the lowest\nnet promoter score (NPS) are: Broadcom/Symantec, followed by Cisco, IBM,\nMcAfee, and, in a tie, Okta and KnowBe4.\n\nOf course, new, unforeseen categories will arise as we all start relying more\non AI. Invariably, the adoption of any new technology introduces new\nvulnerabilities that an organization must address\u2014as happened with the\ntransition to the cloud, to the benefit of a long list of founders and their\ninvestors.\n\nIf you are building something at the intersection of security and AI or data,\nwe\u2019d love to connect.\n\nMore Stories\n\ndate is not set\n\nApril 8, 2024\n\n## Minecraft, Physics, and ML\n\ndate is not set\n\nMarch 14, 2024\n\n## Software and a Service\n\ndate is not set\n\nMarch 6, 2024\n\n## Financial Services are the New Wedge\n\ndate is not set\n\nMarch 5, 2024\n\n## Investing in Metaplane\n\ndate is not set\n\nFebruary 29, 2024\n\n## AI Has Killed the Traditional SaaS GTM Playbook\n\ndate is not set\n\nFebruary 21, 2024\n\n## Investing in PermitFlow\n\nMore Stories\n\nAbout us\n\nFounder PledgeFounders on FelicisImpactBenchmark Your Org\n\nMission\n\nTeam\n\nCompanies\n\nFocus Areas\n\nAIGlobal ResilienceInfraHealth & BioSecurityVertical SaaS\n\nInsights\n\nGet updates about Felicis, our founders, and our insights in your inbox:\n\nThank you!
