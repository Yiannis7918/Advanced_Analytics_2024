This is one of the most frequently used records in the DNS Zones.\n  * What is PTR record? - PTR records are used for the Reverse DNS (Domain Name System) lookup. Using the IP address you can get the associated domain/hostname.\n  * What is the CNAME record? - The CNAME record is also known as a canonical name record. It is used for specifying that a domain name is an alias for another domain, the \"canonical\" domain.\n\n  * Master DNS zone - The Master Zone also known as Primary Zone in the DNS server is the read or write copy of the DNS database.\n  * Slave DNS zone - The Slave/Backup DNS zone also known as Secondary is the read-only copy of the DNS records. This means that the DNS records cannot be added directly to the Slave/Backup DNS zone.\n  * What is a DNS query? - A DNS query (also known as a DNS request) is a demand for information sent from a user's computer (DNS client) to a DNS server.\n\nFree DNS\n\nFree Forever\n\n  * 4 Unicast DNS servers\n  * 1 DNS zone\n  * 50 DNS Records\n  * 500K DNS queries per month\n  * 1 Mail forward\n  * Dynamic DNS\n  * 24/7 Live chat support\n\nSign Up for free\n\nPremium DNS\n\nStarting from: $2.95/month\n\n  * All free and extended features\n  * +4 Anycast Premium Servers\n  * More zones, records, queries and mail forwards\n  * DNS Failover & DNSSEC\n  * Free zones migration\n  * Free SSL\n  * 24/7 Live chat support\n  * 1,000% Uptime SLA\n  * Starting from $2.95/month\n\nCompare plans\n\nDDoS Protected DNS\n\nStarting from: $5.95/month\n\n  * All free and extended features\n  * +4 Anycast Protected Servers\n  * More zones, records and mail forwards\n  * Unlimited queries per month\n  * DNS Failover & DNSSEC\n  * Free zones migration\n  * Free SSL\n  * 24/7 Live chat support\n  * 10,000% Uptime SLA\n  * Starting from $5.95/month\n\nCompare plans\n\nGeoDNS\n\nStarting from: $9.95/month\n\n  * 4 Anycast DNS servers\n  * Cost Effective.
