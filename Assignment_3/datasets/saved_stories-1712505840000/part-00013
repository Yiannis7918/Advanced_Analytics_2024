The\nvehicle's central software and communications platform can be configured to\nshow advertising on large screens that can be fitted to the sides of the van,\nand signing up to fit this system to your van is quite simple. Put simply, if\na vehicle is going to see constant use in high density urban areas, the system\nenables businesses to generate advertising revenue whilst they work.\n\nhelixx.tech\n\n3/10\n\nThe Helixx delivery van has a 2100 litre capacity and a 500 kg maximum\npayload.

Helixx\nTechnologies has begun taking registrations in Southeast Asia for its electric\ncar and van subscription service and we're about to see a fascinating roll-out\nof what appears to be a thoroughly excellent and potentially VERY disruptive\nidea.\n\nHelixx's cheapest subscription rate works out to $0.25 cents per hour, which\nwould logically be the full-time rate of having a new car/van with \"the lot\"\n(insurance, maintenance) ... that's $6.00 per day ... no up front fees ...\nnothing else to pay ... just add your own electricity.\n\nMore Stories\n\nUrban Transport\n\nTiny electric robovan cleans 1 million square feet of road per charge\n\nMarine\n\nBiomimetic propeller brings whale-like flow to hubless marine e-drive\n\n### We recommend\n\nPowered by\n\n  * Targeting settings\n  * Do not sell my personal information\n  * Google Analytics settings\n\nIf your car stops or is in an accident, there's an instant replacement\navailable, which is an attribute bound to appeal to those using the EV for\ncommercial purposes - with the ownership model, that's the owner's problem.\nHere, the car is immediately replaced like-for-like and commercial activity\nresumes post haste.\n\nMinimising downtime for commercial vehicles is important so having the\nbatteries swappable makes sense too. The Helixx vehicle platform can take up\nto six 2 kWh LFP (Lithium iron Phosphate (LFP) battery packs for a total\ncapacity of 12 kWh and a range of 200 km (124 miles). If that's not enough for\na taxi shift or a delivery run, it's just a matter of swapping batteries to be\nproductive again. Charging times become irrelevant.\n\nThe Helixx delivery van has a 2100 litre capacity and a 500 kg maximum\npayload. The 140cm long load bay is accessible by a rear door 110cm wide, so\nit can accommodate most global shipping pallets. The body is 3.2 meters long\nand 1.5 meters wide. The central driving position ensures compatibility in\nboth left- and right-hand-drive markets.\n\nhelixx.tech\n\nThis all makes for a very compelling proposition in comparison to the current\ncar \"ownership model\" that is responsible for the 1.5 billion cars currently\ncirculating on the planet. The problem is that the ownership model has the\nmomentum of a century-old industry behind it and a lot of influential people\nhave a lot invested in maintaining the status quo.\n\n## The auto industry is one of the most potent economic drivers in history\n\nThe Helixx EV comes in four main variants, all based on the same platform\nwhich has 30% less mass and hundreds of fewer individual components than\ntraditional vehicles.\n\nhelixx.tech\n\nThe automotive industry currently contributes USD $1 trillion to the American\neconomy each year and has historically contributed 3+% of the Gross Domestic\nProduct (GDP) of the entire country. It directly employs 1.7 million people\nand is also a massive consumer of goods and services from other manufacturing\nsectors, making it an even more important driver of the entire manufacturing\nindustry's contribution (11.5%) to GDP.\n\nAmerica has had its \"century of the automobile\", as have all other developed\neconomies. America and most of Europe are now \"replacement markets\" for the\nautomobile industry. Earth has nine billion people and 1.5 billion motorised\nvehicles in circulation, so while the ownership model has been good to the\nworld's most advanced economies, it is probably not as widespread as you might\nhave thought.\n\nAll the Helixx vehicles have a top speed of 80 km/h (50 mph) and a maximum 20\nhp. Up to six 2 kWh LFP (Lithium iron Phosphate (LFP) battery packs can be\ninstalled for a total capacity of 12 kWh and a maximum range of 200 km (124\nmiles).\n\nhelixx.tech\n\nIn America, only 8% of households don't have a car. There are 50 countries in\nthe world where only 8% of households DO have a car, and where it is still an\naspirational dream to have the freedom that powered personal mobility brings.\n\nEvery major country benefits enormously from its automotive industry, with\nChina leading the way as the world\u2019s largest producer and consumer of\nautomobiles. The Chinese automotive industry represents 10% of the gargantuan\nChinese GDP. For smaller automobile-producing countries, the percentage is\nhigher: it's 16% in France, with some smaller automobile-producing countries\ndepending on the industry for more than a third of GDP.\n\nIt's not hard to see how Helixx\u2019s business model could bring disruptive\ninnovation to one of the world's largest industries and how that might have\ndire consequences across the broader economic landscape ... by achieving its\nintended purpose of empowering under-privileged communities access to greater\nmobility.\n\n## Helixx is currently building a pilot manufacturing facility in Singapore\n\nThe perfect contrast between the electric Helixx and the vehicle it will\nreplace across the world, the ubiquitous two-stroke Tuk-Tuk.\n\nhelixx.tech\n\nSometime early in 2025, we'll be able to see this grand scheme in action when\nthe Singapore facility begins producing cars, utes, vans and tuk-tuks. If all\ngoes to plan, the people currently signing up to indicate interest in becoming\nthe scheme's first customers, will have their vehicles a year from now.\n\n\"Disruptive entrants\" typically capture unmet demand in an existing market,\nand the ingenious nature of the Helixx system is based around that premise. It\nisn't attempting to sell automobiles to the most privileged third of the\nspecies who already have one, but to reconfigure the automotive (\"autos\" is\nGreek for \"self\", \"motivus\" means \"of motion\" in Latin) offering for all those\nwho don't.\n\nHelixx is unlikely to reach America or Europe with its current vehicles.\nHelixx is aiming its subscription model at developing countries where vehicles\nhave traditionally been imported and expensive and its model is disruptive in\nmore than one way, because the intention is to offer a complete 'Factory in a\nBox' system that can establish a local manufacturing facility inside six\nmonths.\n\nThe vehicles are modest by developed-world standards, but they are built to be\nperfectly fit for purpose. The aim is to provide cost-efficient transport\noptions for people who don't want or can't afford the up-fronts of the vehicle\nownership model and who don't need a car that does more than 50 mph.\n\nThat's one of the fascinating outcomes of taking a helicopter view of the\nautomotive industry. The citizens of most Western countries drive around in\ncars and vans that are capable of achieving double the posted speed limits,\neven though those capabilities are almost never used. Many people own cars\nthat can do triple the speeds they will actually be driven at.\n\nThe Helixx manufacturing hubs will be local, flexible, scalable and very\nefficient. A 5,000m^2 building can support the manufacture of 100,000 cars a\nyear, with the energy use and manufacturing costs of the system claimed to be\nless than half the current auto industry standard\n\nhelixx.tech\n\nIn Western economies, where there are dozens of cars in each class competing\nin a replacement market, it is important that manufacturers have cars that\ncompete on the spec sheet, so they build their cars bigger and stronger to be\nsafely capable of the 100+ mph speeds their competitors can do, and the end\nresult is that we are all paying to have a car that is engineered for\nconditions it will never experience. It is much heavier than it needs to be,\nso it needlessly uses lots of energy accelerating and decelerating, and tires\nand brake pads wear faster because of the weight too.\n\n## Part McDonalds, part Netflix\n\nThe entire Helixx plan calls for the modular cars and vans to be produced\nlocally using a high-tech computational manufacturing system that enables\nmarkets with no EV-manufacturing legacy to create their own e-mobility\necosystems. Helixx claims it can have a Mobility Hub up and running in just\n180 days. That is, from initial site survey to producing saleable vehicles in\nsix months.\n\nhelixx.tech\n\nIn a puzzle of logic, no-one disputes the genius of the potentially disruptive\nHelixx business model, yet the two main parts of the Helixx system were\ninspired by existing business models.\n\nThe \"local manufacturing facility in a box\" idea first occurred to Helixx\nfounder and CEO Steve Pegg when he was in a McDonalds, and began thinking\nabout the McDonald's franchise model. Just as McDonald's franchisees don\u2019t\nneed to know how to create hamburgers (they simply have to strictly follow a\nset of detailed instructions), the same is now true for the Helixx\nmanufacturing facility.\n\nThe body system has been designed for ease of construction and assembly, and\nsignificantly reduces manufacturing costs by using only five key structural\ncomponents, which are glued together.\n\nOne of the in-built potentials of the Helixx system is the ability to\nsubsidise running costs in urban areas through advertising revenue. The\nvehicle's central software and communications platform can be configured to\nshow advertising on large screens that can be fitted to the sides of the van,\nand signing up to fit this system to your van is quite simple. Put simply, if\na vehicle is going to see constant use in high density urban areas, the system\nenables businesses to generate advertising revenue whilst they work.\n\nhelixx.tech\n\nBy now you can tell that Helixx is a bold business venture, an exceedingly\nclever suite of ideas and we're not surprised that it won the 'Emobility\ninfrastructure provider' award at the recent 2024 E-Mobility Awards.\n\nThe big question is, \"what happens to the existing automotive economy if it\nworks as advertised?\"\n\nView gallery - 10 images\n\n### We recommend\n\n  1.
