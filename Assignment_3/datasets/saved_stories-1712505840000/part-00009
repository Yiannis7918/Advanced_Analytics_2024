That's exactly what an experimental new quadcopter can\nnow do, allowing it to stay aloft pretty much indefinitely.\n\nDeveloped by scientists from the University of Southern Denmark, the charging\ntechnology could be utilized by drones carrying out a wide variety of tasks.\nThat said, it's intended first and foremost for use by autonomous drones\nperforming power line inspections. After all, those copters are already going\nto be within easy reach of the lines at all times.\n\nMore Stories\n\nTechnology\n\nWorld's largest digital astronomy camera ready to solve cosmic mysteries\n\nTechnology\n\nNixie tube space clock gives you the time in kilometers\n\n### We recommend\n\nPowered by\n\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Do not sell my personal information\n  * Google Analytics settings\n\nI consent to the use of Google Analytics and related cookies across the\nTrendMD network (widget, website, blog).

This device sits within a cable guide consisting of two\nwidely spread inward-sloping arms.\n\nWhen the drone's onboard software detects that its battery is getting low, the\naircraft uses its camera and radar to spot the closest power line. The\naircraft then flies straight up toward that line from underneath.\n\nUpon reaching the power line, the drone's cable guide directs the line into\nthe gripper. As the line goes in, it pushes down on two elastomer ribbons\nspanning the open space between the gripper's two rubber sides. This action\ncauses those sides to quickly close together overtop of the power line \u2013 no\nelectricity required.\n\nThat said, once the line has been gripped, a magnetic control circuit kicks in\nto power the gripper, keeping it firmly closed around the line as the drone\nhangs beneath. A top-located inductive charger on the drone then starts\ndrawing current from the power line. Once the aircraft's battery is fully\ncharged, the gripper opens and the drone can resume its line-inspecting\nduties.\n\nIt should be noted that only a small amount of upward thrust by the drone is\nrequired to initially trip the gripper. Additionally, if the voltage of the\npower line is sufficient, it serves as the power source for the control\ncircuit \u2013 otherwise, the drone's battery is used.\n\nIn field tests performed on power lines at Denmark's HCA Airport, the 4.3-kg\n(9.5-lb) demonstrator drone was able to operate for over two hours, recharging\nits battery five times between line-inspection sessions. The scientists are\nnow working on boosting the system's robustness, and hope to test it in both\nmore remote locations and in adverse weather conditions.\n\nYou can see the drone in power-line-gripping action, in the video below. A\npaper on the research is being presented at The 2024 IEEE International\nConference on Robotics and Automation.\n\nAnd for another take on power-line-inspecting drone-like things, check out the\nLineRanger robot, which crawls along lines instead of flying overtop of them.\n\nAutonomous Overhead Powerline Recharging for Uninterrupted Drone Operations -\nICRA 2024\n\nSource: University of Southern Denmark\n\n## Tags\n\nDronesUniversity of Southern DenmarkPowerCharging\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Flipboard\n  * LinkedIn\n\nNo comments\n\nBen Coxworth\n\nBased out of Edmonton, Canada, Ben Coxworth has been writing for New Atlas\nsince 2009 and is presently Managing Editor for North America.
