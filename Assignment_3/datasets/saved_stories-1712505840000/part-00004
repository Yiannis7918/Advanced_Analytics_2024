Our platform empowers users to create their own AI assistants tailored\nto them, integrating seamlessly with their existing tools and services.\n\nThrough an intuitive chat interface, users can interact with their AI\nassistant to perform a wide range of tasks, from managing customer inquiries\nand updating sales records to analyzing data trends and generating reports.\nThe AI assistant utilizes natural language processing and machine learning\nalgorithms to understand user queries and execute actions across multiple\nplatforms efficiently.\n\nMoreover, our platform offers flexibility by allowing users to communicate\nwith their AI assistant through popular chat platforms like Slack, Discord,\nNotion, WhatsApp, and more. Whether at their desk or on the go, users can\naccess their AI assistant from any device or chat application, ensuring\nseamless communication and productivity.\n\nAI Assist as a Service revolutionizes the way users manage their workflows by\nproviding a centralized and intelligent assistant capable of handling tasks\nacross various platforms with ease. With our platform, users can boost\nefficiency, save time, and enhance collaboration across their organization.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n  * Installation\n  * Usage\n  * To-do\n  * Contributing\n  * License\n\n## Installation\n\n### Backend (Python/Django)\n\n  1.
