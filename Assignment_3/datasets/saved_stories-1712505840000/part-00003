The cake was devoured by hungry network\nprofessionals at the NANOG 47 meeting.\n\nIPv6 is the next generation of the Internet Protocol, and will dramatically\nexpand the number of addresses available for web sites, as well as millions of\nmobile devices with Internet access. Although the transition will address some\nof the network's challenges, others will clearly persist. That includes\ndisputes over peering, which have quickly made the jump from IPv4 to IPv6.\n\nComplaints of a \"broken IPv6 Internet\" emerged last week on the North American\nNetwork Operators Group mailing list, which surfaced a peering issue involving\nIPv6 connections between Hurricane Electric and Cogent Communications. That\nprompted a response from Hurricane's Mike Leber, who blamed Cogent for the\ndifficulties.\n\n\"If you've been around long enough, you'd know that normally nobody talks\nabout peering publicly like this,\" Leber wrote. \"Then why would I write this\npost? Because I want to set the record straight regarding Hurricane Electric's\nIPv6 peering goals, and nothing in Cogent's case seems to get through\n\nto them.\"\n\nCogent had less to say its relationship about Hurricane Electric. \"It is\npublic knowledge that our networks are connected,\" said Travis Wachter, the\nMarketing Communications Manager for Cogent. \"As for peering agreements, we\ncannot discuss them publicly as we have non-disclosure agreements in place.\"\n\nTraffic Swapping Peering allows two providers exchanging large volumes of\ntraffic to save money by connecting directly, rather than routing traffic\nacross their paid Internet connections. Peering is often free as long as the\namount of traffic exchanged is not out of balance, providing substantial cost\nsavings for bandwidth for high-traffic sites and networks.\n\nCogent has been involved in a number of high-profile peering disputes over the\nyears, including de-peerings that disrupted IPv4 connectivity with Sprint,\nTelia and Limelight Networks.\n\nHurricane Electric has invested time and money in staking out an early\nposition as an IPv6 compliant network. \"We are a Tier 1 IPv6 backbone,\" said\nMartin Levy, Hurricane Electric's Director of IPv6 Strategy. \"If there is\nanother player that comes into v6, we set up peering. We continue with our\noffer to Cogent to turn up peering with him. The community in general has\nlooked at us and given us the vote of approval.\"\n\nA Cake-Shaped Olive Branch While Hurricane Electric pointed the finger at\nCogent, it has also extended an olive branch. Leber's NANOG post commented\nthat \"we stop short of baking cakes\" to encourage peering. But at this week's\nNANOG 47 meeting in Dearborn, Mich., Hurricane Electric presented a cake\ninscribed with an invitation to Cogent to peer with HE over IPv6.\n\n\"At Hurricane Electric, we want v6 to be successful and have spent a lot of\ntime evangelizing it,\" Levy explained. \"If our competitors don't want to do\nanything, so be it. Turning up v6 has been good for us. It has fundamentally\nchanged our business. But the same problems that exist in the v4 world will\nexist in the v6 world.\"\n\n5 comments\n\nHide comments\n\nRecommended Reading\n\nGuide to Migrating From VMware to Hyper-V\n\nApr 04, 2024\n\nUnlocking Tomorrow's Data Centers: A Deep Dive into Next-Gen Innovations\n\nApr 04, 2024\n\nIn-Sync: The Crucial Role of Timing in Data Centers\n\nApr 03, 2024\n\nHow AI Is Poised to Upend Cloud Networking\n\nMar 28, 2024\n\n  * Load More\n\n  * About Us\n  * Contact Us\n  * Advertise\n  * Sitemap\n  * Ad Choices\n\n  * CCPA: Do not sell my personal info\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Terms of Service\n  * Content Licensing/Reprints\n  * Cookie Policy\n\nFollow us:\n\n\u00a9 2024 Informa USA, Inc., All rights reserved\n\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Terms of Use\n\nSubscribe to Receive Data Center Knowledge Straight to your your inbox.\n\nI am a Data Center Professsional - I want to subscribeI\nproduce/distribute/finance data centers - I want to subscribe\ud83d\udcd6 Not interested.\nLet me read on\n\n", "frontpage": false}
