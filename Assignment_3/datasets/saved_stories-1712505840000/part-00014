However, it has a 4 minute\nmaximum compile time, which is not enough to compile large documents into\nPDFs.\n\nTo solve this problem, I devised an automated approach to compile Overleaf\ndocuments on Github. This approach takes advantage of the automated Github\nsync built into Overleaf.\n\nThe approach has two steps:\n\n  1. Sync project to Github\n  2. Run Github actions to compile the PDF automatically.\n\nI\u2019ll walk you through step-by-step how to do this.\n\n## Sync to Github Actions\n\nYou\u2019ll need to first setup Github sync. If you don\u2019t already have one, you\u2019ll\nneed a free Github account.\n\nInside your Overleaf project, click Menu, then Github. Once you connect your\nOverleaf to Github, you\u2019ll be presented with a screen like this:\n\nClick \u201cCreate a Github Repository\u201d and wait a few minutes for everything to be\nsetup. Afterwards, close and reopen the Github dialog in Overleaf and click\n\u201cPush Overleaf changes to Github\u201d.\n\n## Automatic compilation using Github Actions\n\nWe will use Github actions to compile the Latex to a PDF every time we sync\nfrom Overleaf to Github.\n\nIn your Overleaf project, create a new folder called .github (using the little\nfolder icon circle). Inside .github, create another folder called workflows.\nAnd inside workflows create a file called compile.yml. Make sure to remove the\n\u201c.tex\u201d from the ending. It should look like this:\n\nPaste the following into compile.yml\n\n    \n    \n    name: Build LaTeX document on: [push] jobs: build_latex: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Set up Git repository uses: actions/checkout@v3 - name: Compile LaTeX document uses: xu-cheng/latex-action@v2 with: root_file: ClassicThesis.tex continue_on_error: true args: -pdf -file-line-error -interaction=nonstopmode - name: Upload PDF file uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3 with: name: PDF path: ClassicThesis.pdf\n\nReplace, \u201cClassicThesis\u201d with the name of your Latex file. Then, sync Overleaf\nto Github again. You might be asked to authorize Overleaf to use Github\nactions; say yes.\n\nNext, go to the repository that you created earlier on Github. Under the\nActions tab for the repository, you\u2019ll be able to click your latest workflow\nrun. Inside that run, there will be the new PDF under Artifacts:\n\n", "frontpage": false}
