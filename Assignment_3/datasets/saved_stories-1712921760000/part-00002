However, some advanced materials and configurations developed over\nthe past several years have demonstrated the capability of generating and\ncollecting more than one electron from high-energy photons, representing an\nEQE of over 100%.\n\nWhile such multiple exciton generation (MEG) materials are yet to be broadly\ncommercialized, they hold the potential to greatly increase the efficiency of\nsolar power systems. In the Lehigh-developed material, the intermediate band\nstates enable the capture of photon energy that is lost by traditional solar\ncells, including through reflection and the production of heat.\n\nThe researchers developed the novel material by taking advantage of \"van der\nWaals gaps,\" atomically small gaps between layered two-dimensional materials.\nThese gaps can confine molecules or ions, and materials scientists commonly\nuse them to insert, or \"intercalate,\" other elements to tune material\nproperties.\n\nTo develop their novel material, the Lehigh researchers inserted atoms of\nzerovalent copper between layers of a two-dimensional material made of\ngermanium selenide (GeSe) and tin sulfide (SnS).\n\nEkuma, an expert in computational condensed matter physics, developed the\nprototype as a proof of concept after extensive computer modeling of the\nsystem demonstrated theoretical promise.\n\n\"Its rapid response and enhanced efficiency strongly indicate the potential of\nCu-intercalated GeSe/SnS as a quantum material for use in advanced\nphotovoltaic applications, offering an avenue for efficiency improvements in\nsolar energy conversion,\" he said. \"It's a promising candidate for the\ndevelopment of next-generation, high-efficient solar cells, which will play a\ncrucial role in addressing global energy needs.\"\n\nAlthough integrating the newly designed quantum material into current solar\nenergy systems will need further research and development, Ekuma points out\nthat the experimental technique used to create these materials is already\nhighly advanced. Scientists have, over time, mastered a method that precisely\ninserts atoms, ions, and molecules into materials.\n\nMore information: Srihari Kastuar et al, Chemically Tuned Intermediate Band\nStates in Atomically Thin CuxGeSe/SnS Quantum Material for Photovoltaic\nApplications, Science Advances (2024).
