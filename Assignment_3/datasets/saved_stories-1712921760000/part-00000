Usually they shouldn\u2019t.\nIntellectual property lawyers might disagree with this advice but, remember,\nthey make more money if you don\u2019t take it.\n\nThere are two strategies to patents. A defensive strategy tries to protect\nvalue, and an offensive strategy tries to create it. Early stage startups\nshould only have offensive strategies. Here\u2019s how it works:\n\n# Defensive strategies\n\nA defensive patent strategy tries to protect value. Your strategy is defensive\nif you might use patents against competition. Especially if your startup\nbuilds proprietary technology, this seems like the obvious approach. But it is\nalmost never the right one.\n\nThe first issue is money. Actually defending patents is almost impossible for\nstartups. By definition, startups don\u2019t have the money to invest in\nlitigation. You\u2019ll run out of money before anyone worth suing. And your\ncompetitors will already have won if you spend your resources trying to build\na legal case instead of a business.\n\nThe money problem is compounded by time. You can\u2019t defend against patent\ninfringement until your patent is granted so, for the application period\n(usually a few years), patents are pure cost. If you are outcompeted or die\nbefore you can defend them, whatever patents do get granted are too little too\nlate.\n\nThird, patents are flimsy. Doing patents well means creating a portfolio of\nmixed risk applications, like you would with an investment portfolio. Some are\nbroad and speculative \u2013 hard to defend but valuable if you can; and some are\nnarrow and safe \u2013 easier to defend but probably less valuable. There\u2019s the\nflimsiness: the patents you\u2019re most able to defend are the easiest to work\naround. A few tweaks and competitors won\u2019t be infringing.\n\nIronically, for early stage startups, a defensive patent strategy is more\nlikely to be a cause of death than protection against it.\n\n# Offensive strategies\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean patents are useless for early stage startups. You can use\nthem offensively \u2014 to create value, rather than protect it.\n\nThe first way is to use patents to increase acquisition value. Although early\nstage startups can\u2019t have a defensive patent strategy, big companies often do.\nIf you\u2019re in a competitive field with acquisitive corporates, a good patent\nportfolio could be extremely valuable for them. You can use this to your\nadvantage.\n\nLike with talent acquisitions, big companies will buy startups\u2019 technology at\na premium to its immediate value to the startup. Talent acquisitions have\ndouble value for big companies: if you work for me, you create value for me;\nand you also can\u2019t work for my competitors. The same thing is true for\nintellectual property: if I have your patents, I can use them against my\ncompetitors; and my competitors can\u2019t use them against me.\n\nThe technology you\u2019re patenting isn\u2019t necessarily valuable for your startup,\neven if your startup is more valuable to your acquirers. The ways you can\nmonetise your technology might be different. This is your hedge \u2013 \u2018what are we\ndoing that\u2019s relevant to potential acquirers?\u2019.\n\nThe second way is to use patents as signalling to investors. If you\u2019re working\non something novel or hard, most investors won\u2019t understand it. Often it won\u2019t\nbe cost effective to do the due diligence required to, either. Patents are a\nquick, if unreliable, shortcut. You can use this to your advantage.\n\nHaving patent applications often makes investors less sceptical about your\ntechnology. This is especially true if a reputable firm filed your\napplications: their reputation depends partially on useful patents getting\napproved.\n\nGiven this, you should patent proof points for your most ambitious technology\nclaims. This strategy won\u2019t make your technology actually new or valuable \u2013\nanyone can file a patent application. But, oddly, it might make investors more\nlikely to believe you.\n\n# Three simple rules\n\nThere are three simple patent rules for early stage startups:\n\n  1. Don\u2019t think about patents until you need to raise money.\n\n  2. You can\u2019t patent defensively.\n\n  3. Only patent offensively.\n\nThere will always be exceptions, but you\u2019re probably not one of them.\n\n# PS. hedging\n\nYou can use provisional patent applications to hedge and buy optionality.\nUsing patents offensively can be complex, expensive, and time consuming.\nBuying time is useful, especially if you\u2019re in an fast moving area where new\ninformation becomes available quickly.\n\nProvisional patent applications give you a placeholder for a fixed time,\nusually a year, to apply for a patent. They require less effort and, if you do\nend up filing a full patent, the date you made the provisional application\nwill be used as the filing date. They also don\u2019t require you to publicly\ndisclose as much information as a full patent application.\n\nYou can focus on building your business, but keep the option to patent later.\n\nI am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice.
