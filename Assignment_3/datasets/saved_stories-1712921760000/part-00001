But it instead filed a discontinuance notice\nending the matter.\n\n###### READ MORE\n\nFacebook owner sued over dodgy crypto ads\n\nForrest said the decision showed Facebook was \"beyond the laws of Australia\"\nand that Australians who had lost savings in the scam were \"not protected\".\n\n\"Scams will continue to run rampant with no recourse for those who are duped\nby increasingly sophisticated technology on social media platforms that take\nno responsibility,\" he said.\n\n\"In this case, the Australian legal system was incapable of holding Meta to\naccount for flagrant conduct that causes significant harm to Australian\ncitizens.\"\n\n### Twiggy pledges to continue battle\n\nForrest said he would continue his battle and campaign for urgent law reform\nso action could be taken against foreign-owned social media platforms, such as\nFacebook.\n\n\"Meta hides behind the lie that it does not do business in Australia, hiding\nbehind a US entity.\"\n\nAndrew Forrest said Facebook had \"blatantly\" refused to take down fraudulent\nads on the platform featuring his likeness. Source: AAP / James Ross\n\nWhen Forrest launched the case in 2022 it was the first time Meta had been\nprosecuted with criminal charges \u2014 three counts of recklessly dealing with\nproceeds of crime to the value of $1,000 or more \u2014 related to its social media\nplatform.\n\nIt's alleged the company failed to take sufficient steps to take down the scam\nads, that were published in 2019 and feature Forrest and other prominent\nAustralians.\n\nForrest has said Meta \"blatantly\" refused to remove thousands of fraudulent\nscam ads on its platforms despite repeated requests.\n\n###### READ MORE\n\n'Is this still available?': The common trick scammers are using to skim your\nmoney on Facebook Marketplace\n\nMeta had entered pleas of not guilty to the charges after initially saying it\nhad no case to answer in Australia.\n\n### Civil case to be heard in the US\n\nForrest, the founder of Perth-based Fortescue Metals Group, also launched\ncivil proceedings against Facebook in California in September 2021.\n\nThat matter is also scheduled to be heard in the US on Friday.\n\nThe civil case will determine if Meta is liable for allegedly publishing and\nnot removing thousands of fraudulent ads featuring Forrest's image.\n\n\"I'm asking the courts of California, I will ask the courts of Australia, to\nfix this illegal or improper content rapidly,\" Forrest said.\n\nIf successful, it could force Meta to be more accountable for fraudulent\ncontent on its platforms in Australia and globally.\n\nShare\n\n3 min read\n\nPublished 12 April 2024 2:29pm\n\nSource: AAP\n\nTags\n\nScamsSocial media\n\nShare this with family and friends\n\n## Recommended for you\n\n### The unexpected cost that could add $500 to your Bali trip\n\nVaccination\n\n### Lizzo says 'I quit' in emotional Instagram post\n\nSingers\n\n### A new scam is circulating in Australia.
