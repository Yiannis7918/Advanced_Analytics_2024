As a man, I made a couple\nof attempts a few years ago to learn Italian; while I'm hardly fluent, I have\nalways been struck by the minimalism and elegance of Italian grammar. (I've\nbeen told that Italian is afflicted with a painfully large number of irregular\nverbs, but I never got far enough to suffer through that.)\n\nAs a native speaker of English, I'm obviously not qualified to judge the\ngrammatical complexity or simplicity of my own language compared to someone\nelse's.

As English is pretty isolating, it is\ncertainly pretty straightforward by this metric.\n\nUnfortunately this perspective ignores the fact that English conveys a lot of\ngrammatical information through syntax, something that probably seems\nfiendishly complex to a monolingual speaker of a polysynthetic language with\nvery free word order. English is also renowned for its enormous lexicon and,\ndespite much of it being so infrequently used that one has to wonder the\nextent to which it actually exists in people's heads, this does result in some\ndistinctions of nuance that might seem like needless nitpicking to many second\nlanguage speakers, rather than simple straightforward language.\n\nExamining the underlying assumption (that the number of distinct inflections\nreflects the complexity of a language's grammar), Finnish is often given as an\nexample of an incredibly complicated language (after all, just look at how\nhuge any of the verb tables on Wiktionary are), and yet each suffix behaves in\na fairly predictable way and looks pretty much the same no matter what word it\nappears on, all whilst being able to put the words in different orders with\nmuch less risk of accidentally asking a question or saying something\nunintelligible.\n\nUltimately I think it's just a perspective bias. As English-speakers we take\nour complex syntax for granted, but we aren't used to complex inflectional\nmorphology and so that is the only thing we tend to notice when asking \"is\nthis language's grammar simple or complex\". Add to this the fact that native\nEnglish-speakers are less likely to be exposed to other languages at a young\nage than speakers of many other languages and so don't have our assumptions\nchallenged so much, and that bias can get pretty overwhelming (and on the\nconverse, this means that, e.g. native Finnish-speakers, being exposed to\nEnglish and other more isolating languages like Swedish from a young age, are\nless likely to take the biased position that Finnish is straightforward, and\nit is the English and Swedes who are overly complex with all their rules on\nword order).\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\nImprove this answer\n\nFollow this answer to receive notifications\n\nedited Sep 23, 2020 at 13:53\n\nPeter Mortensen\n\n12744 bronze badges\n\nanswered Sep 22, 2020 at 15:04\n\nTristanTristan\n\n8,2922525 silver badges4646 bronze badges\n\n11\n\n  * 5\n\nAre you saying then that all perceptions as to the relative complexity of\nvarious languages are 'just a perspective bias'?

However,\nUkrainian and Russian are very similar, they don't have any principal\ndifferences, although differences are present on all the levels of the\nlanguage, beginning with alphabet and phonemes and ending with syntax. When\nUkrainians start learning English they are usually shocked with the idea of\nhow enormously different a language can be from what they thought a language\nshould be.\n\nIn Ukraine, the majority of English textbooks and dictionaries are in British\nEnglish. The first difficulty a learner faces is the amazingly complicated\nsound system of English, especially the vowel system. Ukrainian has 6 vowel\nphonemes, /a, \u025b, i, \u026a, \u0254, u/, English (RP) has 20 (excluding triphthongs),\nwhich is about 3.5 times more than in Ukrainian. And they can be short and\nlong!.. And there are diphthongs!.. All of them are different from the\nUkrainian vowels, none is pronounced the same way, and they all should be\ndistinguished in pronunciation!.. Half of the consonants are alveolar (no\nalveolar consonants at all in the Slavic languages). And the consonants are\nnot palatalized before /i\u02d0/... Really? How can that be? And the aspirated\nstops... None of the Slavic languages has aspirated consonants, few learners\never master them. And those /\u03b8/ and /\u00f0/... Then goes the spelling... The\nUkrainian spelling is pretty phonetic, but strictly prescriptive, especially\npunctuation, at school Ukrainians have to learn lots of long and complicated\nrules, e. g. when to write the negative particle together with, and when\nseparately from the following word or where to put a comma and where a\nsemicolon. In English you've just got to learn the spelling of each individual\nword and no obvious rules (actually, there is one spelling rule), which is a\nrelief for some, but a baffling difficulty for others.\n\nThe English noun doesn't have any genders, a luxury which only learners of\nFrench and German can fully appreciate. And no case forms! Still, it has\nsomething that is so complicated that most Ukrainian and Russian learners of\nEnglish never master it fully. As for me, I cannot dare swear I've mastered it\nas much as I would like to. That thing is the number-countability-definiteness\ncomplex. The very idea of the noun category of definiteness / indefiniteness\nis alien to the majority of the Slavic languages except for the closely\nrelated Macedonian and Bulgarian languages. In order to begin using articles\ncorrectly Ukrainians have to learn to analyze the reality in quite a new way,\nto change their way of thinking from the moment they learn about the existence\nof articles and to the end of their lives. Few succeed. I think this category\nis much more complicated than gender and case taken together, since\nremembering the gender and case forms of a noun is mechanical work, you use\nthis or that form automatically, the syntax suggests which form should be\nused. Definiteness is different. It's up to you which one you choose, a or\nthe, but! the meaning of the whole utterance depends on this choice of yours,\nand you cannot skip the choice since it is mandatory in English that\ndefiniteness / indefiniteness should be explicitly marked on every noun, which\nmeans you really have to learn the analysis of the reality for definiteness, a\nskill which is needed only when you talk or write in English, that is, which\nis useless for most learners who usually use English for reading or watching\nfilms and who talk English only at English lessons.\n\nThe English adjective is a real candy with just one single form (in the\npositive degree) as compared to 24 gender-number-case forms in Ukrainian and\nRussian and 48 gender-number-case-declension forms in German. But the English\nverb... Everything about the English verb is very complicated. Well, the\nUkrainian and Russian verbs are also complicated, but they are complicated in\nan absolutely different way, their synthetic morphology is tangled, all those\nnumerous prefixes with unpredictable meaning, irregular forms that even native\nspeakers have problems with (remember, our grammar is highly prescriptive),\nand many seemingly grammatical categories which are realized not by\ninflection, but lexically, by derivation. Still, in the indicative mood active\nvoice Russian has 3 tenses (present, past, and future), Ukrainian has 5\n(present, past, pluperfect, and 2 future tenses with exactly the same meaning)\nor 4, pluperfect being practically not used nowadays. And English has 16...\nSimple, Continuous, Perfect, Perfect Continuous times Present, Past, Future,\nFuture-in-the-Past is 16 tenses. Whyyy? Sooo? Manyyy? What's the purpose of\nthat unbelievable number, if one can well live with 3 or even 2 tenses? How on\nearth can there be 4 present tenses while I live pretty happily with just 1?\nHere again, in order to be able to use those 16 tenses one has to learn a new\nway of analyzing the reality, tracing the actions for continuousness and\nperfectness (needless to say that continuousness and perfectness are alien to\nUkrainian and Russian ways of seeing the reality), and watching closely for a\nnon-past tense not getting accidentally into a sentence with the past in the\nmain clause. The Ukrainian and Russian tenses have relative meanings, and in\nthe subordinate clauses of sentences like \u201cHe said he knew me\u201d and \u201cHe said he\nwould find me\u201d Ukrainian and Russian use present and future verb forms\nrespectively, so an English learner has to understand the idea of an absolute\ntenses which is extremely difficult, it's not because the very idea is\ncomplicated, but because that idea contradicts all of one's life experience,\nit's a fundamental difference which is usually learned by many, but understood\nand used in practice by few. And then, there's that weird question and\nnegation do/does/did thing which is aggravated by the fact that some verbs\nneed it and some don't... Slavic native speakers aren't even usually aware\nthat there's such a thing as a negative form of the verb, you just put the\nparticle ne before the verb, and that's all! (Czechs and Slovaks are, perhaps,\naware, since ne is written together with the following verb in their\nlanguages). But in English, negating a verb is a complicated thing to do, it\ncomes out that those \u201cnegator\u201d don't / doesn't / didn't is inflected for\ntense, number, and person, very much like it's in Finnish, one would hardly\nexpect such a situation from an Indo-European language. Because of that, the\nfirst English tense which is usually presented to a learner is Present\nContinuous (\u2018I am doing\u2019), but here again, one faces all these I'm, you're,\nisn't, aren't, the words made of words of different parts of speech fused\ntogether into one, and you have to know when you can use them and when you're\nto use the full form. And also, there are phrasal verbs, like \u201cgo on\u201d or \u201cgive\nup\u201d with unpredictable meaning which compensate for the Slavic prefixed verbs.\nThe English verbals have continuous and perfect forms (e. g. \u2018to have been\ndoing\u2019, \u2018having done\u2019, etc.) which are not complicated to construct but very\ncomplicated to grasp the meaning of, and the way to use them correctly. Then\ngo the modal verbs (\u201ccan\u201d, \u201cmight\u201d, \u201cmust\u201d, and the like) which are not a\nsimple thing in practically all the languages, but in English they are\nespecially complicated, since one is supposed to distinguish the minute\ndetails and distinctions of, say, \u201ccan do\u201d, \u201ccould do\u201d, and \u201ccould have done\u201d.\nI wrote \u201cminute details\u201d, since in Ukrainian and Russian the distinctions\namong the modal words are very rough. For example, we have the same word for\n\u201ccan\u201d and \u201cmay\u201d (U. \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0442\u0438, Ru. \u043c\u043e\u0447\u044c) and Russian has the same word for \u201cmust\u201d,\n\u201cshould\u201d, \u201cought to\u201d, \u201cto have to\u201d, \u201cto be to\u201d: \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0435\u043d (actually, there are\ndifferent words for the latter must-like words, but they are rarely used).\n\nAs for the syntax, it's been already mentioned in other answers here, the\nfixed, rigid word order of English is what makes it complicated. Slavs are\nused to beginning a sentence with whatever word first comes to one's mind.\nSubject pronouns are often dropped (Polish, Czech, and Slovak are consistent\npro-drop languages). Not so in English, the SVO sequence is practically never\nbroken, which means that to be able to speak English correctly you've got to\nknow what the subject and what the object in the utterance are, that is, you\nhave to learn the sentence analysis, which can be rather difficult, especially\nfor adult learners (children study sentence analysis at school and they\nusually remember how to do it). Additionally, the ability to find the main\nclause of the utterance is needed for following the sequence of tenses rule.\n\nAlso, English uses different infinitive and participial constructions which\nare not found at all in Ukrainian and Russian, e. g. \u201cI like her to sing\u201d, \u201cI\nheard her sing\u201d (oh, no \u2018to\u2019 here...), \u201cI heard her singing\u201d, \u201cIt turned out\nto be good\u201d, \u201cI waited for her to sing\u201d, \u201cThe rain having stopped we went\nhome\u201d, etc. The correct usage of all those numerous forms of the English\nverbals is such constructions is a fine art not easily mastered by the\nmajority of learners (not even by the majority of the learners who were\npersistent enough to reach this point of the curriculum).\n\nAnd also there are the dialects of English. When I heard Australian English\nfor the first time I couldn't make out anything. For the native speakers of\nthe Slavic languages who are used to long and beautiful words, English words\nare too short and generally hard to make out in the stream of speech, the\nEnglish language has a strikingly low level of redundancy as compared with the\nSlavic languages (cf. American English \u201cI can't take\u201d sounds exactly like \u201cI\ncan take\u201d). Compare a rather typical Ukrainian noun \u0440\u043e\u0437\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0441\u044e\u0434\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f\n[r\u0254z.p\u0254w.\u02c8sju.d\u035c\u0290\u025bnj.nja] and its English translation, \u201cspread\u201d (like in\n\u2018spread of HIV\u2019)\n\nIn general, the level of analyticity English displays has no parallels among\nthe languages of Europe, and, perhaps, among all the Indo-European languages.\n\u201cAnalytic\u201d is a derivative of \u201canalysis\u201d, and it is deep and complicated\nanalysis of reality that one has to perform in order to be able to use English\nwell.\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\nImprove this answer\n\nFollow this answer to receive notifications\n\nedited Sep 23, 2020 at 21:33\n\nanswered Sep 23, 2020 at 19:42\n\nYellow SkyYellow Sky\n\n18.3k3939 silver badges6565 bronze badges\n\n19\n\n  * 2\n\nI'm not a linguist so I might be misunderstanding something, but I'm rather\ncertain that \"no alveolar consonants at all in the Slavic languages\" is wrong.\n\n\u2013 Dan M.\n\nSep 24, 2020 at 13:18\n\n  * 7\n\nThis is the beautiful thing about learning languages: languages beyond your\nmother tongue have features, concepts, and ways of looking at the world that\nyou would never even imagine if only knew your mother tongue.

Probably also biased by the fact that I've learned English first and at a younger age. Foreign languages are not alone in that regard.

The root of\nthe problem is the mistaken belief that English is a single language.\n\nEnglish has roots in multiple ancient languages, from the various tribes who\nconquered the country up to the Norman Conquest and beyond, as well as loan\nwords from other languages, and entirely new words constructed from (usually)\nGreek or Latin roots. Historically, England had literally hundreds of local\ndialects, which may even have been different enough to constitute a different\nlanguage - remember Caxton's story about people trying to buy eggs. Most of\nthese have not completely survived, but there are still many local dialect\nwords which remain, perhaps the most obvious example being what you call a\nbread roll.\n\nCaxton and printing generally started to apply some standardisation to\nspelling, but this was not entirely consistent. In some ways, this started the\ndevelopment of written English as at best a separate dialect of English and at\nworst a separate language - consider the similar issue of Mandarin and\nCantonese using the same spelling system, but translating those written\ncharacters to different spoken words. Unfortunately, just as spellings started\nto become somewhat standardised, the Great Vowel Shift took place and\npronunciations changed dramatically, making the written language entirely non-\nphonetic. This leads to obvious problems with teaching systems such as\nphonics, which inherently assume that English spelling has phonetic patterns.\nIt does sometimes, but there are many rules, and many exceptions. English\nschoolchildren quite literally have lessons dedicated to memorising these\nexceptions, typically lasting from around age 6-7 until they start secondary\nschool at age 11.\n\nSpelling English words is hard enough that we actually have the concept of\ncompetitive spelling. This is a concept which is completely alien to any\nlanguage such as German where spelling is (almost) entirely phonetic. (Of\ncourse German has its own complexities - Germans have a similar challenge to\nlearn the gender of words, and some very irregular prefixes, but that's\nanother story.) The problem of irregular spelling makes dyslexia a major issue\nfor English people.\n\nOf course spelling is not grammar. However the multiple roots of English words\ncreate multiple, conflicting rules for noun plurals, verb tenses, and other\ngrammatical constructs such as negation, comparison and superlatives, plus\nsome cases which are simply irregular. With this being the case, it is not\neasily possible to separate spelling and grammar when it comes to these\ngrammatical features. And as I said, written English is its own dialect and\nhas different rules from spoken English, including grammatical rules, which\nthese issues feed into. This has not been helped by Victorian amateur\nlexicographers attempting to \"standardise\" these based on sometimes-incorrect\nbeliefs about the origins of words, and their varying success has tended more\nto confuse matters than to simplify.\n\nMoving on from there, how do we construct sentences? There was a period from\nthe 1970s to maybe the 1990s or so where English grammar was not really\ntaught, and many people only found out that grammar rules existed when\nlearning foreign languages and having to identify the corresponding rules in\ntheir own language. These days though, grammar also forms a part of the\nprimary school curriculum in England - often to the confusion of parents, who\nhave to Google what their children are asking them because they were not\ntaught this themselves!\n\nBasic English grammar does generally have fewer rules than some other\nlanguages - verbs mostly do not change significantly depending on subject or\nobject. However it also has a fair degree of flexibility and inference from\ncontext, which can be both a strength and a weakness. As previously said,\nirregular forms are a problem for many situations such as plural nouns. It\nalso has rules which are not often formally stated for native English\nspeakers, which are simply absorbed implicitly. Adjective order is a good\nexample of this - all native English speakers would notice an incorrect use of\nadjective order as being \"wrong\", and most could correct it, but most would be\nunable to say why it was wrong. And across the British Isles, basic sentence\nstructure can be slightly different between England, Wales, Scotland and\nIreland, so even these rules of grammar are not set in stone.\n\nThe situation is complicated further by Britain's expansion around the world,\ntaking the English language with it. Dialects of English now exist all round\nthe world, and since each dialect has developed separately, English people\n(and speakers of English in other dialects) may not be able to understand\nthem. American English is the obvious example - we mostly know that \"sidewalk\"\nmeans \"pavement\" and \"pavement\" means road, for instance, but American English\nalso has some words such as \"catercorner\" (meaning \"diagonally across a\ncrossroads\") which simply do not exist in Britain. (In the case of American\nEnglish, these are often older English words which have fallen out of use in\nBritain, which complicates the issue still further - an English person in 1700\nmight have understood them, but we don't today!) The situation is even worse\nfor Indian English where not only are there significant dialect words to deal\nwith, but the influence of Hindi affects the basic grammar.\n\nAll this does have an upside though, and this is where Eddie Izzard may have a\npoint. With the number of dialects and the variations in grammar, words and\naccents, most English speakers are relatively used to having to understand\npeople who don't speak exactly the same as themselves. For people who speak\nEnglish as a second language, this is a definite advantage because native\nEnglish speakers are highly experienced in interpreting meaning from context.\nThe results may be unintentionally amusing, but we can still pick up on what\nwas intended, and it can be relatively easy to get your meaning across with\nrelatively little command of the language. This should not be mistaken for\nEnglish being \"easy\" though - it's just that we generally have a high\ntolerance for errors before comprehension completely breaks down.\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\nImprove this answer\n\nFollow this answer to receive notifications\n\nedited Sep 23, 2020 at 15:56\n\nanswered Sep 23, 2020 at 13:13\n\nGrahamGraham\n\n24911 silver badge66 bronze badges\n\n7\n\n  * @PeterMortensen Thanks for the tweaks! :)\n\n\u2013 Graham\n\nSep 23, 2020 at 14:45\n\n  * 6\n\nCaxton's story is about the lexicon, not grammar.

There are some grammar differences, but\nthey're minimal. And I suspect Izzard wasn't really talking about all the\ndialects combined, but the British English that he's familiar with (most\nspeakers of any language don't need to interact much with people who speak a\ndifferent dialect).\n\n\u2013 Barmar\n\nSep 23, 2020 at 15:07\n\n  * 2\n\n@Barmar As I said, the reason English is different is that most speakers do\nregularly need to interact with people who speak a different dialect/accent,\nor do regularly consume media where people speak with different\ndialects/accents. And because of this, the tolerance for errors (whether in\nword choice, spelling or grammar) is generally higher because our \"normal\"\nrange is wider to start with. This compares with a language such as French\nwhere there is literally a government organisation to standardise what French\n\"should\" be.\n\n\u2013 Graham\n\nSep 23, 2020 at 15:53\n\n  * 4\n\n@Graham But the same is true of the vast majority of languages. Apart from a\nfew edge cases (most either creoles or located in the UK), the vast majority\nof English dialects are actually extremely similar, particularly considering\ntheir enormous geographic spread. And most English-speakers do not deal with\nsignificantly different dialects very often. Americans rarely hear Glaswegians\nor Belfasters, and they often need subtitles when they do. Overall, English is\none of the most homogenous languages in the world, relative to number of\nspeakers and geographic spread.\n\n\u2013 Janus Bahs Jacquet\n\nSep 24, 2020 at 0:06\n\n| Show 2 more comments\n\nThis answer is useful\n\n3\n\nSave this answer.\n\nShow activity on this post.\n\nAs one of my English teachers used to say, English is like a cactus: it looks\nvery simple from a distance, but when you get close, you can see all the\nspines.\n\nI can't comment on most of the languages out there, but in comparison to some\nof the few European languages I know at least a bit about, English is indeed\nvery simple on the usual first stumbling blocks:\n\n  * English only uses 26 letters. No diacritics. French has the same 26, to which one has to add at least \u00e0\u00e2\u00e9\u00e8\u00ea\u00ef\u00f4\u00f9\u00fb\u00fc\u00e7. Even french people have a hard time with many of those.\n\n  * English has three genders, but they are mostly straightforward: other than a few amusing exceptions such as ships, only people are male or female, everything else is neutral. Compare that with French (only two genders, but they seem to have been randomly assigned) or German (three genders, apparently randomly assigned as well).\n\n  * English has only four forms of nouns: singular or plural, and possessive variations thereof, and which one to use is straightforward. No accusative, dative, genitive, or other such cases as in German, Latin, or Russian, where you need to learn which form goes with each verb (possibly several). Of course English uses prepositions, which you need to learn, but German uses both!\n\n  * English adjectives do not change with gender, count, case, or anything else.\n\n  * English has at most 8 different (non composed) forms of a verb, and that includes all variations in person, case, tense, etc. Other than to be and to have, all other verbs have at most 2 forms which can be irregular (hence the irregular verb list). Compare that to French which can have dozens, not including composed forms.\n\nEven comparing composed forms, English is much simpler than French and its 4\nmodes and 20+ tenses (granted, a few of those are rarely if ever used, but a\ngood selection remains).\n\nEnglish verb forms to not change with gender, and only in limited cases with\nperson. Compare that to french and its complex rules to decide when the past\nparticiple needs to follow the gender and count of... well, it depends :-)\n\n  * Sentence structure is easier in English that in German, where verbs can be pushed at the end.\n\nAlso, it is worth noting that if you can speak English, you can mostly write\nit, and have little risk of getting it wrong if you pay attention to a few\ntricks (it's/its, your/you're...). Note that the opposite is not true, you\ncannot read aloud English without context and knowledge, the same letter\nsequence can be pronounced in very different ways (e.g. ough and its 12\ndifferent pronunciations, as in though, through, cough, ought, drought...),\nand even the exact same word can be pronounced differently in different\ncontexts (e.g. read).\n\nThis is very different from French for instance, where a verb finishing with\nan \u00e9 sound could be spelled with \u00e9, \u00e9e, \u00e9s, \u00e9es, er, ez...), depending on\ngrammar. You just can't imagine how many french people just can't get those\ncorrectly.\n\nAll in all, at least compared to French, German, Latin or Russian, English is\nindeed quite simple. Things may be quite different if compared to Chinese\ndialect for instance, though.\n\nA good indicator is perhaps the frequency at which national authorities\npublish \"reforms\" or \"simplifications\" of the language. Both French and German\nunderwent such reforms in the nineties...\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\nImprove this answer\n\nFollow this answer to receive notifications\n\nanswered Sep 23, 2020 at 22:20\n\njcaronjcaron\n\n13933 bronze badges\n\n11\n\n  * 1\n\nEnglish adjectives do change for the degrees of comparison, e. g. big \u2013 bigger\n\u2013 biggest. Also, a typical English regular verb has 4 simple forms, not 2, e.\ng. work \u2013 works \u2013 worked \u2013 working and a typical irregular verb has 5: write \u2013\nwrites \u2013 wrote \u2013 written \u2013 writing.\n\n\u2013 Yellow Sky\n\nSep 24, 2020 at 4:13\n\n  * 1\n\n\"if you can speak English, you can mostly write it\" - from the point of view\nof a German native speaker, that claim sounds extremely far-fetched. How would\nyou decide between \"if\"/\"iff\", \"you\"/\"yoo\", \"speak\"/\"speek\"/\"speeque\" without\nmemorizing the correct spelling, for instance? Not to mention that there are\nseveral inaudible letters in there.\n\n\u2013 O. R. Mapper\n\nSep 24, 2020 at 6:39\n\n  * 5\n\nQuite a bit of this is about orthography, not about grammar. The German\nlanguage has never been reformed nor officially encoded; there only was a\nsmall orthography reform. Also, English orthography only has never been\nreformed because it lacks a central authority to do this and it\u2019s such a mess\nthat you wouldn\u2019t even know where to begin (thanks to the Great Vowel Shift).\nIf there is any true language absolute, it\u2019s that English has the worst\northography. There is a reason why spelling bees are only a thing in the\nAnglosphere \u2013 disproving: \u201cif you can speak English, you can mostly write it\u201d.\n\n\u2013 \u02c8v\u0280\u0329\u02a6l\u0329\u02ccp\u0280m\u0329ft\n\nSep 24, 2020 at 6:40\n\n  * @\u02c8v\u0280\u0329\u02a6l\u0329\u02ccp\u0280m\u0329ft: \"The German language has never been (...) officially encoded\" - umm, I'd say in German, there is a definitive sense that there is one \"officially correct\" spelling and grammar, at least individually within Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, and along with that, an equally definitive sense that what is not covered by any of those \"official\" definitions is, plain and simple, \"wrong\". It is at least my impression that this aspect is a lot hazier in English.\n\n\u2013 O. R. Mapper\n\nSep 24, 2020 at 6:47\n\n  * 1\n\n@YellowSky \"2 forms which can be irregular\". Of course the base form\n(infinitive) is the starting point, and 2 of the forms are regular (s suffix\nand ing suffix), and do not need to be memorised in any way. That's why\nirregular verb tables only have 3 forms, infinitive (base form) and the 2\nforms which can be irregular (preterite and past participle).

But only weakly, and the difference is especially small compared to\nthe other major world languages. He thinks languages that, as he puts it,\n\"have been subjected to a lot of second language learning\" get a lot of their\ntricky rules dropped. This would include Spanish, French, Portuguese, and\nChinese, among other languages. The really complicated ones are the indigenous\nlanguages spoken by only a few hundred people.\n\nI believe there is controversy around his argument, but it seemed relevant to\nthis discussion. I don't have a specific reference to cite, but he has written\nabout this a fair amount, so it shouldn't be too hard to track down.\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\nImprove this answer\n\nFollow this answer to receive notifications\n\nanswered Sep 24, 2020 at 17:26\n\nMark FoskeyMark Foskey\n\n43133 silver badges66 bronze badges\n\n1\n\n  * He's got a point, too.
