In such a scenario, the Space Force wants to have the capability\nto respond, either to deter an adversary from taking action or to defend a US\nsatellite from an attack.\n\n## Going up to take a look\n\n\"When another nation puts an asset up into space and we don't quite know what\nthat asset is, we don't know what its intent is, we don't know what its\ncapabilities are, we need the ability to go up there and figure out what this\nthing is,\" said Gen. Michael Guetlein, the Space Force's vice chief of space\noperations.\n\nThis is what the Space Force wants to demonstrate with Victus Haze. For this\nmission, True Anomaly's spacecraft will launch first, posing as a satellite\nfrom a potential adversary, like China or Russia. Rocket Lab will have a\nsatellite on standby to go up and inspect True Anomaly's spacecraft and will\nlaunch it when the Space Force gives the launch order.\n\n\"Pretty sporty,\" said Even Rogers, co-founder and CEO of True Anomaly.\n\nThen, if all goes according to plan, the two spacecraft will switch roles,\nwith True Anomaly's Jackal satellite actively maneuvering around Rocket Lab's\nsatellite. According to the Space Force, True Anomaly and Rocket Lab will\ndeliver their spacecraft no later than the fall of 2025.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"If a near-peer competitor makes a movement, we need to have it in our quiver\nto make a counter maneuver, whether that be go up and do a show of force or go\nup and do space domain awareness or understand the characterization of the\nenvironment\u2014what's going on?\" Guetlein said.\n\nVictus Haze is the next in a series of military missions dedicated to\nvalidating Tactically Responsive Space (TacRS) capabilities. With these\nefforts, the Space Force and its commercial partners have shown how they can\ncompress the time it takes to prepare and launch a satellite.\n\nLast year, the Space Force partnered with Firefly Aerospace and Millennium\nSpace Systems on the Victus Nox mission. The Victus Nox satellite was built\nand tested in less than a year and then readied for launch in less than 60\nhours. Firefly successfully launched the spacecraft on its Alpha rocket 27\nhours after receiving launch orders from the Space Force, a remarkable\nachievement in an industry where satellites take years to build and launch\ncampaigns typically last weeks or months.\n\nEnlarge / One of True Anomaly's first two Jackal \"autonomous orbital\nvehicles,\" which launched in March on a SpaceX rideshare mission.\n\nTrue Anomaly\n\n\"We no longer have the luxury of time to wait years, even 10 or 15 years, to\ndeliver some of these capabilities.\" Guetlein said in a discussion in January\nhosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"A tactically\nrelevant timeline is a matter of weeks, days, or even hours.\"\n\n\"Victus Haze is about continuing to break those paradigms and to show how we\nwould rapidly put up a space domain awareness capability and operate it in\nreal time against a threat,\" Guetlein said.\n\nThe Victus Haze mission is more complicated than Victus Nox, involving two\nprime contractors, two spacecraft, and two rocket launches from different\nspaceports, all timed to occur with short timelines \"to keep the demonstration\nas realistic as possible,\" a Space Force spokesperson told Ars.\n\n\"This demonstration will ultimately prepare the United States Space Force to\nprovide future forces to combatant commands to conduct rapid operations in\nresponse to adversary on-orbit aggression,\" Space Systems Command said in a\nstatement.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How The Callisto Protocol's Gameplay Was Perfected Months Before Release\n\n#### reader comments\n\n14\n\nStephen Clark Stephen Clark is a space reporter at Ars Technica, covering\nprivate space companies and the world\u2019s space agencies.
