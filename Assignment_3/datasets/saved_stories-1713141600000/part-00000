Security sources are\nsteering us away from the hostile state theory.\n\nSo who was behind the scam (if that's what it was)? And what did Charlie and\nAbi want?\n\nHere is what we know - and, almost as importantly, what we don't know about\none of the weirdest, and most troubling, stories to hit Westminster in a long\ntime.\n\n## It all began in Bournemouth\n\nThought this was a story confined to the Conservative Party and William Wragg\n- the MP who ended his own career after admitting he had been \"scared\" into\nsharing colleagues' numbers with someone he met on a dating app?\n\nThink again.\n\nThe honeytrapper - as we shall call him, her or them - first popped up on\nSaturday, 23 September last year in Bournemouth, the opening day of the\nLiberal Democrats' annual conference.\n\n  * Police knew about 'honeytrap' messages last year\n  * Wragg quits Commons jobs over Westminster honeytrap\n  * Honeytrap Tory MP right to apologise, says Sunak\n\nWe have spoken to two male conference attendees who received messages that day\non the gay hook-up app Grindr from someone with the user name M-xl.\n\nM-xl said he was 28 and interested in \"chat, friends, hookups\". He used a\nphoto of a blonde man appearing in his 20s.\n\nGrindr is a proximity-based app, meaning that you are shown the profiles of\nthose who are nearest to you.\n\nGetty Images\n\nMessages were exchanged on a gay hook-up app\n\nFalling into conversation with one of those he messaged, M-xl said he had\nheard about \"orgy stories\" from the conference.\n\nThe conference attendee responded with what he said was a made up story.\n\"Hot,\" M-xl replied.\n\nBy this point, he was in a bar with friends. \"I said to the people I was with:\n'Hang on, have you had a message from this person?' And we'd all had similar\nmessages,\" he said.\n\n\"They were kind of hinting they wanted to sleep with MPs,\" the second attendee\ntold us. \"They were asking for gossip, if I knew of anyone that would be\ninterested in sleeping with them.\"\n\n## His name was Charlie\n\nMonths later, people would suspect what became known as the Westminster\nhoneytrap of being the act of anyone ranging from a lone individual seeking\nsexual gratification to being the actions of a hostile state.\n\nBut those messaged in Bournemouth reached a different conclusion: they thought\nthey were being targeted by a journalist seeking information.\n\n\"Just as a heads up to gays,\" another man wrote on a group chat for some male\nfriends at the conference, \"pretty sure there's a Journo honeytrap on Grindr\".\n\nOthers then disclosed that M-xl had asked them questions about what the worst\nthing they had ever heard an MP do was, and to share any compromising photos\nthey had of others.\n\nCertainly there were plenty of journalists in Bournemouth to cover the Liberal\nDemocrat conference.\n\nYet despite Grindr being designed to show you men nearby, M-xl was not\nactually there. One of those messaging M-xl realised why he appeared keen on\ninformation but not that keen on meeting up: he was using a feature of the app\nwhere you can chat to profiles elsewhere. M-xl appeared in fact to be in north\nLondon.\n\nIn one case we're aware of, the conversation with M-xl progressed to WhatsApp.\nThey asked what his real name was. M-xl said his name was Charlie.\n\n## Mystery deepens at Labour gathering\n\nDifferent party, different city, same approach. A few weeks later M-xl was\nmessaging men at the Labour conference in Liverpool.\n\nSo far, several attendees, including an MP, have reported speaking to M-xl on\nGrindr there. One was reportedly sent explicit photos by the account.\n\nThe BBC has not been able to speak directly to those who exchanged messages\nwith M-xl on Grindr at the Labour conference. A crucial question is whether\nM-xl was indeed in Liverpool or was messaging from London, as with the Liberal\nDemocrat conference.\n\nBut according to The Times, M-xl told at least one user that he worked for a\nlobbying organisation and had been working at a stall in the convention\ncentre.\n\n## Honeytrapper gets by-election fever\n\nOn 19 October, Labour overturned two vast Conservative majorities in by-\nelections in Mid-Bedfordshire and Tamworth.\n\nIt was a big night for the honeytrapper too. As polls closed, one person\nworking in parliament received a message from a number they did not have saved\non WhatsApp asking them if they were staying up for the by-election results.\nThey called themselves Charlie. And they used a photo of the same person as\nM-xl.\n\nThis was the first \"out of the blue\" message we are aware of - what would\nbecome Charlie and Abi's modus operandi.\n\nThe next day, as jubilant Labourites celebrated their victories, one got a\nmessage from Abi. \"Long time no speak,\" it said. \"But think I saw you from a\ndistance in MB yesterday...how're you?\"\n\nThe activist had indeed been in mid-Bedfordshire that day. Abi claimed they\nknew the individual from their work on a previous political campaign.\n\nAnd then... silence.\n\n## A missed opportunity?\n\nThe honeytrapper seems to have simply ceased operating for several months\nafter the by-elections. We are not aware of anybody who was in contact with\nthem, either on Grindr or WhatsApp, between October and February.\n\nBut a new disclosure by the Metropolitan Police on Thursday makes that picture\nless clear.\n\nHoC\n\nWilliam Wragg ended his career four days after his admission\n\nIn response to enquiries by the BBC, the Met admitted that it had received\nreports from two different MPs about receiving unsolicited explicit images -\nin October, November and March. It's unclear whether the October and November\nreports were different MPs or the same one, followed by a new MP sounding the\nalarm in March.\n\nAs part of their regular liaison with the Met, parliamentary security\nofficials were informed.\n\nWas this a missed opportunity? Should MPs have been warned at this point to\navoid any messages from Abi and Charlie?\n\nOne MP we spoke to argued otherwise, saying that MPs received frequent general\nwarnings about their cyber-security.\n\n\"We're meant to be grown-ups. We get warnings the whole time,\" they said. And\nthe Met said there was no suggestion at this point of the scale of people\nbeing targeted.\n\n## Finally rumbled\n\nEither way, the honeytrapper's known actions became much more intense after\nthe Met was first made aware of their work.\n\nFrom February onwards, it seems to have mainly been politicians and political\njournalists receiving unwanted messages, as some of us have already recounted,\nincluding details of a fractious exchange on the morning of Monday, 11 March.\n\nAt one point during this exchanges Abi appeared to admit that she was indeed\nthe same person as Charlie.\n\nThat evening the honeytrapper's activities resumed with a passionate\nintensity.\n\nLast week we reported that a former MP had been messaged by Charlie just after\n5pm.\n\nWe now know that another man, a former Conservative MP, received a message\nfrom Charlie 15 minutes earlier that same night, to which he did not respond.\n\nA serving government minister also received a message from Charlie late that\nnight, telling Politico that they engaged briefly before blocking that number.\n\nIt means that at least four people were targeted by the honeytrapper on just\nthat day. As it happened, it was a heady day in Westminster too, with Rishi\nSunak holding a widely-discussed meeting with the executive of the 1922\ncommittee of Conservative backbenchers.\n\nGetty Images\n\nTory MP Andrea Jenkyns has suggested she was also targeted\n\nOn 19 March, Conservative MP Luke Evans made a complaint to Leicestershire\npolice about an unsolicited image he received of a naked woman. He also\nalerted the Conservative chief whip. The BBC is aware of another man working\nin Westminster who was contacted by Charlie on 22 March.\n\nYet other than the Liberal Democrat conference attendees right back in October\n2023 there is no evidence that at any point any of the many targeted realised\nthat they were part of a broader group.\n\nNot, that is, until a story on the Politico website, on 2 April, brought Abi\nand Charlie to public attention and the honeytrapper's scheme was rumbled.\n\n## The unanswered questions\n\nLet's start with the biggest question: who is behind this?\n\nWe simply don't know, and nor do the Met as far as we know.\n\nOne initial theory - that these are the actions of a hostile state - seems to\nhave been roundly discounted. Security sources say there is no sign of the\nhigh level of sophistication or insight that would suggest a state is\ninvolved.\n\nSo, who then? William Wragg's statement last week may provide some clues to\nwhat is going on.\n\nHe says that he felt \"threatened\" into handing out the phone numbers of\ncolleagues by somebody he had met on Grindr. Yet there is no reason why he\nshould have had the numbers for those in other parties who were not contacted\nvia Grindr, and they generally say they have never interacted with him.\n\nIt is also unclear when Mr Wragg handed over the numbers, or indeed when he\nfirst began interacting with the honeytrapper.\n\nAs well as the who, there is the why?\n\nSome people involved, including MPs, were asked for and sent explicit photos.\n\nBut we are not aware of any instances where they were specifically blackmailed\nor told the photos would be used in a certain way.\n\nSome of the targets believe that the motive was sexual: that the person wanted\nexplicit photos of specific people for their own pleasure.\n\nHow widely did this spread?\n\nThis may prove an unanswerable question.\n\nAlmost every day we have reported on this story we have learnt of at least one\nmore target. It may well be that shame or embarrassment is preventing more\nfrom coming forward, at least to journalists rather than to the police.\n\nYet if the honeytrapper is never identified, we may never know how vulnerable\nWestminster's inhabitants are to security threats.\n\nAnd there is no doubt that more sophisticated scams will come their way soon.\n\nConservative Party\n\nPalace of Westminster\n\nWilliam Wragg\n\nCyber-security\n\nRelated\n\n## Tory MP appears to back Reform UK's Lee Anderson\n\n3 days ago\n\nUK Politics\n\n## Green quits mayoral race 'to prevent vote split'\n\n3 days ago\n\nTees\n\n## Tory mayoral candidate promises 1,500 extra police\n\n4 days ago\n\nLondon\n\nMore\n\n2 days ago\n\n## Cyber-attack data 'could be sold by hackers'\n\nInformation accessed by hackers could be used to make passports, a cyber-\nsecurity expert says.\n\n2 days ago\n\nLeicester\n\n3 days ago\n\n## Police knew about 'honeytrap' messages last year\n\nThe Met began investigating suspicious WhatsApps to men at Westminster much\nearlier than thought, the BBC learns.\n\n3 days ago\n\nUK Politics\n\n4 days ago\n\n## Honeytrap Tory MP right to apologise, says Sunak\n\nThe PM brushes off suggestions he should have acted before the MP voluntarily\ngave up the Tory whip.\n\n4 days ago\n\nUK Politics\n\n4 days ago\n\n## Does Sunak regret not sacking William Wragg?\n\nThe PM says William Wragg was right to apologise for sharing the phone numbers\nof MPs with someone he met on a dating app\n\n4 days ago\n\nUK Politics\n\n4 days ago\n\n## Election poll tracker: How do the parties compare?\n\nHow do people say they will vote in the UK general election?
