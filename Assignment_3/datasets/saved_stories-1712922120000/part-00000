Like Siri, Alexa or\nGoogle Assistant, you could ask the pin for answers to general questions, get\ncalendar updates, and receive and respond to text messages. More impressively,\nyou could use the device\u2019s onboard camera to scan objects in front of you to\nprovide helpful information. In his demo, Chaudhri asked the pin to scan a\npiece of food held in his hand to determine whether eating it might be\nunhealthy.\n\nIt was pitched as a device finally capable of breaking our smartphone\naddiction. It just also happened to include a camera, a rechargable battery,\nmicrophones, speakers and a cellular data plan and phone number for making\ncalls.\n\nMore accurately, it teased the potential of ending the game of the app Whac-A-\nMole we all currently play on our phones. By pushing our primary interaction\nwith technology away from screens, we could be free again to fully take in the\nlife happening right in front of us.\n\nThe entire elevator pitch might as well have been cocaine to some venture\ncapital and technological evangelists online. \u201cIt uses AI!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a new\nhardware form factor!\u201d \u201cFormer Apple alums started the company!\u201d \u201cDid we\nmention AI!?!\u201d\n\nA few months later, leaks began springing in the brand\u2019s hype fuel tanks.\n\nHumane\n\nThe company conducted a more traditional unveiling presentation in November,\nwhich some online immediately ribbed for its odd, low energy vibes. Word also\ncirculated that several prominent tech media outlets, including The Verge,\nweren\u2019t invited to the presentation, suggesting Humane was more interested in\nsharing information with a narrower, and potentially less scrutinizing media\ncadre.\n\nThen there was the matter of the Pin doing a very typical AI thing in the\nmiddle of the presentation \u2013 i.e., bullshitting with extreme confidence. The\ncompany also laid off 4% of its staff in January.\n\nIn short, it\u2019s been a brutal six-month stretch for the fledgling brand, and\nthings don\u2019t appear to be turning around any time soon based on the slew of\ninitial reviews on the Humane AI pin.\n\nJust look at these headlines.\n\nFrom Engadget: \u201cThe Humane AI Pin is the solution to none of technology\u2019s\nproblems.\u201d\n\nFrom The Verge: \u201cHumane AI Pin review: not even close.\u201d\n\nFrom The Washington Post: \u201cHumane A.I. Pin review: A promising mess you don\u2019t\nneed yet.\u201d\n\nFrom Wired: \u201cHumane Ai Pin Review: Too Clunky, Too Limited.\u201d\n\nWoof.\n\nThen there\u2019s this. The CEO of ChatGPT, Sam Altman, who is an investor in\nHumane, has made news headlines about his attempts to raise $1 billion\nalongside Jony Ive \u2013 the legendary hardware designer of iEverything fame \u2013 to\nbuild an \u201cartificial intelligence-powered personal device.\u201d\n\nIt all feels oddly reminiscent to me of the dreaded vote of confidence in\ncollege athletics, when athletic directors give public statements of\nsolidarity about a coach\u2019s future with a program, right before they turn heel\nand fire them.\n\nIf I can briefly put the schadenfreude aside, I\u2019ll admit that I\u2019m personally\ndisappointed that Humane\u2019s first attempt has gone so sideways. I\u2019m not an AI\nevangelist by any stretch. I work in an industry the technology seems gung-ho\non subsuming first.\n\nBut I have, like many other tech fans, grown frustrated with the lack of\ninnovation in mobile computing. And until a competitor arrives with an\nappealing enough product to challenge the established powers, the industry has\nfew incentives to shake things up.\n\nI also support at least the part of Humane\u2019s mission statement about building\ntech that \u201cfeels familiar, natural and human.\u201d Like I\u2019m sure many of you, I\nconstantly see competent people struggle to use devices that the tech industry\nchampions as standard bearers for intuitive technology.\n\n> This isn\u2019t some case of your grandparents unknowingly trolling an Apple\n> store employee. If tech experts can\u2019t manage to reliably navigate through a\n> device menu, what possible hope do the rest of us have?\n\nTechnology can be life-changing, but only when it\u2019s easily applied to the\nchallenges we all face. And it\u2019s in this real-life use and application layer\nthat most consumer tech desperately needs to improve.\n\nMany early technologies and first attempts fail. Humane\u2019s domed-shaped hype\ncurve isn\u2019t unprecedented by any means. And voice-based interactions with tech\nstill seem to be an Achilles heel for even the tech giants.\n\nWhat is striking about this particular tech tale is how unready the device is\nfor prime time.\n\nMany reviewers shared that the pin got noticeably warm or hot after wearing\nit. Surely, it\u2019s an issue Humane would have known about through its testing\nprocess.\n\nGiven they designed the device primarily as a wearable you stick on your\nchest, you\u2019d think uncomfortable heating results would have triggered \u201cdon\u2019t\nship this yet\u201d conversations internally.\n\nThen, there are the basic gestures the device requires users to master to\nnavigate its various menus and functions. The early feedback is that the hand\nmaneuvers also appear to be very difficult to master and replicate\nconsistently.\n\nThis isn\u2019t some case of your grandparents unknowingly trolling a sweet Apple\nstore employee. If tech experts can\u2019t manage to reliably navigate through a\ndevice menu, what possible hope do the rest of us have?\n\n> The Humane AI Pin\u2019s launch seems to have suffered from one obvious and all\n> too common mistake that plagues companies, societies, and all of us\n> individuals \u2013 failing to get, or even worse, listen to, outside perspective.\n\nThe company\u2019s media engagement team seems to have handled the initial launch\nreview phase oddly as well.\n\nReviewers found that several Humane AI Pin features weren\u2019t available or\nshipped obviously broken. Early bugs are common for a cutting-edge technology\nrelease. What\u2019s strange is that the reviewers weren\u2019t pre-briefed by Humane\nabout capabilities that still need more time in the oven, which is a\nwidespread practice in tech marketing relations. Maybe Humane did provide a\nheads-up, and reviewers simply collectively forgot about it.\n\nHowever, to those of us on the sidelines, it looks as if Humane just hoped\nsome of the AI Pin\u2019s rough edges would go unnoticed.\n\nThere\u2019s another broader concern too that the Humane AI pin is the latest in an\nincreasingly more frequent line of beta products from Silicon Valley in search\nof an initial wave of paying guinea pigs to learn from.\n\nAt the highest-levels though, the Humane AI Pin\u2019s launch seems to have\nsuffered from one obvious and all too common mistake that plagues companies,\nsocieties, and all of us as individuals \u2013 failing to get, or even worse,\nlisten to, outside perspective.\n\nI\u2019d be shocked if the company didn\u2019t gather testing data from third-party\nproduct testers, making this outcome feel more infuriating and cliche.\n\nAfter all the rationalizing is over, all that\u2019s temptingly left to explain how\nthis could have happened is unrestrained hubris, which the AI industry has\nalready given the world enough of.\n\nFuture reporting may reveal if the Humane AI Pin was just another example of\nthe echo chamber at work. It could also reveal a more straightforward reason \u2013\nlike having to meet an irrational investor\u2019s timelines \u2013 for why the company\nlaunched a product that was so clearly not ready.\n\nWe only know for sure now that Humane\u2019s set a new precedent. Convincing an\nalready weary AI world that AI-centric consumer hardware would be great was a\ntough enough sell. After this failed launch, Humane and even better-executed\nideas in the future will all face an even harder challenge ahead. They must\nconvince us all that their device isn\u2019t just another Humane AI Pin.\n\n## Read More\n\n  * Apple Vision Pro: Our First Impressions of Apple\u2019s New Mixed-Reality Headset\n\n  * Sonos Is About to Relaunch Its App and Solve Our Biggest Beefs\n\n  * The Latest Trend in Tech?
