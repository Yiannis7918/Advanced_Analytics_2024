You love BSD? From FreeBSD to\nOpenBSD, you can get a Kate package via your normal package system.\n\nAnd in the normal case, you can just build it from source on your own, all\nneeded patches should be in our repositories upstream. If that is not the case\nfor your system, please help to upstream them.\n\nBelow the current state of the master branch compiled on NixOS unstable with\nWayland.\n\nHow to compile Kate on your own on a Unix like system and start to help to\ndevelop it can be found out here.\n\n## Windows#\n\nSince several years there are activities in the KDE community to provide our\nlibraries and applications for Windows.\n\nEven if that is a non-free platform, we can reach out to new users and\ndevelopers that might later be then even interested to switch a full open\nplatform.\n\nProgress is slow, but steady. We have Kate and some other applications in the\nofficial Windows Store and nightly build for more of them. With reasonable\neffort you can develop Kate on Windows with Craft.\n\nBelow the current state of the master branch running on Windows 11 inside\nVirtualBox.\n\nIf you like to try that, use the nighly installer linked on the Kate website.\n\n## macOS#\n\nBeside Windows, the major other non-free platform Kate tries to support is\nmacOS.\n\nWe have nighly build available for that and you can, like on Windows, develop\nKate with the help of Craft.\n\nBelow the current state of the master branch running native on my M2 ARM Mac\nMini.\n\nSame as for Windows, if you like to try that, use the nighly installer for\neither ARM or Intel Macs linked on the Kate website.\n\n## Other Platforms#\n\nNaturally there are more than the above mentioned operating systems around.\n\nBeside the mobile ones like Android and iOS that are not that interesting for\nKate, many other desktop operating systems exist.\n\nEven if the Kate team itself doesn\u2019t put active work it them, that doesn\u2019t\nmean Kate can\u2019t run there.\n\nWithout any active work on our side, for example a Kate port for Haiku was\ndone. Some one-liner patches for that got even upstreamed.\n\nIf you work on some port of our stuff and need to upstream stuff, please\ncontact us. Even if you work on a non-mainstream system, as long as the\npatches are not too intrusive, we are interested to have them.\n\n## Help us!#\n\nNaturally the most of our developers are working on the Linux or some BSD.\n\nThat means the other systems are always in need of more people to help out,\nboth on the programming and testing side.\n\nFor Kate, testing should be easy, grab a nighly build for Windows or macOS on\nthe Kate website. Or even better, get Craft running, that will make it easier\nto contribute, too.\n\nOne recent topic that needs love is the removal of DBus for\nWindows/macOS/Android and other systems that don\u2019t use it normally.\n\nIf you are up to help with that, here that is coordinated. The current state\nis already sufficient that the nightly builds of Kate no longer hang on e.g.\nmacOS, but still some frameworks like KIO will need more work.\n\nJust don\u2019t get that wrong, DBus is great on the Linux or BSD systems that use\nit natively, but it is a pain on systems that have no notion of DBus and leads\nthere to hangs or the spawning of unwanted processes. Beside that, the\nusefulness is low there, as there are no services on the bus to communicate\nwith anyways.\n\n## Feedback#\n\nYou can provide feedback on the matching KDE Social or reddit post.\n\n  * kde\n\n\u00a9 2024 Ignorance is bliss... \u00b7 Powered by Hugo & PaperMod\n\n", "frontpage": true}
