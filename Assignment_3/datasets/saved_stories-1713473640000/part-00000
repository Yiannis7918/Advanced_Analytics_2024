Positives and\nnegatives are two sets of outcomes for a binary test. The blue curve shows\ndistribution of negatives and the red curve shows distribution of positives.\nThis distribution is obtained from the result of a classifier which estimates\nthe probability of a test point being positive.\n\nThe key point to note is the area under curve (AUC) is the highest when the\ntwo curves are farthest with little overlap.\n\nAdjust mean of negatives using slider. You can also drag the threshold line in\nthe graph below.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
