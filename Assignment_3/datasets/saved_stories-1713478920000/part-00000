In my\nexperience the only time you ever get a good fit is when you\u2019re copying\nsomeone else (and by definition a budget which already exists).\n\nUsually (and for quite a long time) product market fit means that your\ncustomers have got just enough value from your product or service that they\u2019re\nwilling to tolerate the bugs, inefficiencies and brokenness of the other 75%\nof it.\n\nThanks for reading. You can subscribe for free to get this a little more\nconveniently.\n\nPeter Levin and Martin Casado put it so brilliantly that I almost got\nemotional:\n\n> Most companies don\u2019t find a magical product that just happens to address a\n> key pain point in the market, thus making their go-to-market (GTM) plan a\n> straightforward one. Rather, they engage in a multi-year-long battle of\n> hammering the shit out of the company and the market simultaneously, trying\n> to get the two to hold together.\n\nAn important part of this battle is convincing a selection of companies that\nthey are in fact a category. A label. A cohort. An addressable market.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty amazing just how poor the addressable market data is in some\nsectors (try getting hard data on how much non-UA money is spent advertising\nto games audiences). I have a loose theory that the more VC-driven sectors\nhave the least resilient market data because the funds can\u2019t afford to\ndiligence it properly. PE firms will spend $1m on a transaction including all\nsorts of outsourced research. VCs will call people they went to business\nschool with1.\n\nAn amusing historical fact is that most of the digital kids ad market sizing\nwhich floats around today in pitch decks, earnings reports and all sorts of\ncompany presentations actually originated as an investor due diligence report\nwhich a PE fund commissioned on SuperAwesome (it was so good we released it as\nan industry report). But it\u2019s amazing how much that same data gets\nmisattributed.\n\nThis is not just true for investor-facing market data. At a certain scale,\ncompanies have to move from being product and sales engines to being customer\nunderstanding engines. For example, companies which monetize from advertising\nare fundamentally in the share of wallet business. Early on you can build your\nprojections based on bottoms-up sales team growth targets. But at a certain\nscale the issue becomes not whether you can secure another 10% of the budget\nbut whether there is any more budget there to secure.\n\n#\n\nReading\n\nBy far my most abused term is \u2018ecosystem\u2019. Although it is slightly slow going\nat the beginning, a journey through Charles Mann\u2019s excellent 1493 is a\nworthwhile investment of your time. He describes the Columbian Exchange,\nessentially the merging of various ecologies across the Americas and Europe\nafter Columbus re-established trading lanes in 1493. While reading it, I was\nconstantly being hammered by thoughts of how the merging of AI and other\nsectors will play out over the next few decades. What will be the\ntechnology/software equivalent of oranges growing in Florida today?\n\nThe timeline of human history is being revised almost weekly through a\ncombination of ancient DNA analysis, underwater archaeology, LIDAR analysis\nand occasionally ancient scroll ML competitions. Many of these outcomes\nrequire a displacing of well-seated theories which have either a large volume\nof evidence behind them or a great number of people who have quoted that\nevidence over time. A lot of high quality heresy is about reversing social\nproof and, even if it\u2019s not entirely correct, making people think a bit more\ndeeply about their assumptions. Depending on your interpretation of the\nevidence, Gunung Padang either is or isn\u2019t a 25,000 year-old man-made pyramid\nin Indonesia. The authors of a (peer-reviewed) paper on the topic released all\nthe behind-the-scenes correspondence of what happened when their paper got\nsubsequently retracted.\n\nWardley mapping: a business strategy mapping technique which is helpful to use\nwhen thinking about component invention versus commoditisation (and maybe\nother things too, I\u2019m still working on it)\n\nAt some point a universal age API will be a real thing. In the meantime Meta\nhas been investing in its own user age group API so that app developers can\nsort their offerings into different age groups. Worth reading.\n\n1\n\nThis is not me being mean about VCs! Assuming 2% management fees (at least in\nthe investing period), a $75m seed fund will have ~$1.5m/yr to spend on\nsalaries and transactions whereas a $1b PE fund will have ~$20m/yr for\nprobably the same number of deals. Business school networks are excellent life\nleverage.\n\n### Subscribe to Dylan's half-formed thoughts and musings\n\nBy Dylan Collins \u00b7 Launched 8 months ago\n\nNotes, observations and opinions from a builder and occasional investor in the\ndigital media sector\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The fraud of product-market fit and addressable markets\n\ndylancollins.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nTraps to avoid when you do another startup\n\nThe changing nature of building companies as you get older\n\nFeb 19\n\n6\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Traps to avoid when you do another startup\n\ndylancollins.substack.com\n\nSome thoughts on LEGO Fortnite...\n\nI've wanted to write about this topic for a while.
