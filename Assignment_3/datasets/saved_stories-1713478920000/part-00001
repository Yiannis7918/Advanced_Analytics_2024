Deadline June 1, 2024\n\n# Dnsmasq wins the first BlueHats Prize\n\ndnsmasq\n\nBlueHats prizes is an initiative by the French Interministerial Digital\nDirectorate. They are awarded to maintainers of critical free and open source\nprojects. In 2024 four prizes of \u20ac 10 000 each will be given out. We are happy\nto announce the winner of the first 2024 BlueHats prize is Simon Kelley,\nmaintainer of the dnsmasq project. Dnsmasq provides network addressing for\nsmall networks: DNS, DHCP, router advertisement and network boot.\n\nThe jury, made up of public officials from the Ministries of Education and\nYouth, ANSSI and DINUM, recognised the importance of dnsmasq and its ongoing\ndevelopment for network security. The members of the Open Source Software\nCouncil wish to continue to highlight this type of initiative: discrete\nprojects that are critical to software infrastructures, and maintained by\nreliable teams over the years.\n\nIn response to hearing he had won, Simon Kelley said:\n\n> I'm delighted to accept the prize. Like many Free Software projects, dnsmasq\n> started as a creation for it's own sake, but it has been kept alive and\n> developing for a quarter of a century because of the feedback that has come\n> from its role in the outside world, and the recognition, small and large,\n> that it makes a difference. This prize is valuable financially, but much\n> more so as a mark of public recognition that dnsmasq is still something\n> that's worth doing.\n\n## About dnsmasq\n\nThe dnsmasq project was started in the early 2000\u2019s by Simon Kelley. He wanted\nto connect his laptop to the internet via his PC. The concept of a home router\nwas new: connecting even one computer, via a telephone line, to the internet\nwas a luxury. To let his laptop speak to the internet, the PC had to act as\ngo-between for all the address information.\n\nTo make this happen, Simon started his own project and got it to run on his\nPC. He has been improving and expanding it ever since. And he has been so\ngenerous to publish dnsmasq as Free Software.\n\nThere is a good chance you are using dnsmasq since it is used in many home\nrouters, some Internet of Things devices and included in the Android mobile\noperating system. Dnsmasq is a popular choice because it has low system\nresource requirements and fits a lot of functionality into one program. It\ndoes so in about fifty thousand lines of C code. That is a low number given\nall the different types of devices, each with its own quirks, that dnsmasq has\nto talk to.\n\n## Praise for dnsmasq\n\nAnyone can nominate free and open source projects for one the BlueHats prizes\n(and nominations are still open). Dnsmasq was nominated by Samuel Bizien-\nFilippi, system administrator at P\u00f4le d'expertise de la r\u00e9gulation\nnum\u00e9rique(PEReN) (Center of Expertise in Digital Regulation), motivated his\nchoice by writing:\n\n> Dnsmasq is a versatile server: in a nutshell, it is both a DHCP server and a\n> DNS proxy (that resolves domain names on local networks and internet).\n> Dnsmasq is present in most routers (\"internet box\") and in several\n> virtualization platforms (at least Proxmox VE). It greatly simplifies\n> network configuration. Dnsmasq is a foundational - and overlooked - building\n> block of networks for SMEs and public administrations. We use it at P\u00f4le\n> d'expertise de la r\u00e9gulation num\u00e9rique(PEReN) (Center of Expertise in\n> Digital Regulation).\n\nWhen asked how dnsmasq is used at PEReN, Filippi answered:\n\n> \"At PEReN, we strive to keep all network and system configuration as code in\n> a version control system. Since dnsmasq is configured using flat text files,\n> it's a perfect fit for us. In our setup, dnsmasq is used:\n>\n>   * for network configuration of clients via DHCP\n>   * for automated installation of systems with DHCP and TFTP (both\n> functionality provided by dnsmasq)\n>   * for local name resolution.\"\n>\n\n## BlueHats prizes for maintainers of critical software\n\nThe BlueHats prize aims to place maintainers of critical open source software\nin the spotlight. It is a well-known problem in the free and open source\nworld: The benefit of having open source software is enormous but there is not\nenough attention and resources for maintenance and maintainers. Dnsmasq is a\ntypical example of this state of affairs. Dnsmasq is a component used in many\ncommercial products. Some of the vendors have been willing to pay Simon Kelley\nfor implementing new feautures but there has been no funding for maintenance.\nThe BlueHats prizes seek to encourage users of free and open software to\ninvest in maintenance.\n\n## Nominations still open\n\nThree more BlueHats prizes will be awarded in the upcoming months. You can\nstill nominate your favorite project for one of the \u20ac 10 000 prizes. The\nBlueHats prizes are an initiative of the French public administration. The\nFrench Free Software Unit (an OSPO) has partnered with NLnet to put four\nnotable projects in the spotlight and award them the BlueHats 2024 prizes.\n\n### Search\n\n## NLnet news archive\n\n  * 2024\n  * 2023\n  * 2022\n  * 2021\n  * 2020\n  * 2019\n  * 2018\n  * 2017\n  * 2016\n  * 2015\n  * 2014\n  * 2013\n\n|\n\n  * 2012\n  * 2011\n  * 2010\n  * 2009\n  * 2008\n  * 2007\n  * 2006\n  * 2003\n  * 2002\n  * 2001\n  * 2000\n  * 1999\n\n  \n---|---  \n  \n##### Currently open for proposals:\n\n  * NGI0 Core\n  * NGI0 Commons Fund\n  * NGI TALER\n  * NGI Mobifree\n\n##### Nominate FOSS projects\n\nNominate Free Software Projects for the four \u20ac10.000 BlueHats Prizes.\n\n### Events\n\n2024-05-02 - Tech talk with bunnie on IRIS: an open hardware project to verify\nchips\n\n2024-04-11 - Webinar: Open source CPU and SoC design : The flow, the\nchallenges and a perspective\n\n2024-02-22 - Webinar: The GNU Name System and the road to publishing an RFC\n\n  * Upcoming webinars & recordings\n  * Event archive\n\n### News\n\nDnsmasq wins the first BlueHats Prize 2024-04-18\n\n41 new projects awarded 2024-04-17\n\nApply before June 1st 2024 2024-04-01\n\nDigital David versus Tech Giant Goliath: Interview with Michiel Leenaars on\nRadio 1 2024-03-11\n\nWebinar recording: The GNU Name System and the road to publishing an RFC\n2024-02-22\n\n  * More news\n\n##### Want to do us a favour?\n\nHelp us with 5 minutes of your time.\n\n##### Donate today\n\nYour donation can help grow the future!\n\nNLnet\n\n  * Foundation\n  * People\n  * Contact\n  * Press\n  * Privacy statement\n\nNewsletter\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\nSubscribe\n\nFind us\n\n  * Fediverse\n  * RSS feed\n  * Our BBB server\n\nSite search\n\nFunding\n\n  * Open calls\n  * Theme funds\n\nProjects\n\n  * All projects\n  * Currently running\n  * Thematic index\n\nNews & events\n\n  * News\n  * Events\n  * Webinars\n  * NGI Zero Tour Schedule\n  * Speaker bureau\n\nSupport NLnet\n\n  * Financial contribution\n  * Join the Open Invention Network\n\n", "frontpage": true}
