Some conflicts\nhave been relatively small grudge matches between rivals from adjoining solar\nsystems with maybe a dozen or so frigates and cruisers facing off in fast-\npaced combat. Others, like the Great War, are fueled by tens of thousands of\nplayers and blossom with all the same propaganda, diplomacy (and espionage),\nsupply-chain logistics and military tactics that might fuel a real-world\nconflict, taking months to resolve and changing entire industrial patterns\nacross the star map.\n\nIn all that time one kind of ship has always been the most coveted target for\nany fleet, thirsted after for the glory of defeating it as evidenced by this\nrecording of the first one to die in combat.\n\nTitans, the largest ship class in EVE Online, take thousands of man hours to\nproduce, take months to train to fly, and are capable of fitting massive\ndoomsday weapons that obliterate lesser ships with a single volley. To get a\ngood understanding of the size of these Sci Fi monsters, check out this\ncomparison chart (the Amarr Avatar is the brownish \u201cmushroom\u201d looking behemoth\nwith the similarly sized Erebus above it and Ragnarok and Leviathan below it.\nOther EVE ships are found throughout) or watch this to-scale player-made video\ncomparing several classes of EVE ships.\n\nEach Titan is a prized strategic asset of the Alliance that controls it, and\nup until now no more than 12 had ever been destroyed in any single battle.\nThat recently changed in the largest, most destructive battle in gaming\nhistory.\n\nThe Bloodbath of B-R5RB\n\nIn the early hours of January 27^th, 2014 CONCORD (the NPC \u201cpolice force\u201d)\ncame to collect the sovereignty bill for a dead-end system in the Immensea\nregion called B-R5RB. One of over 7,500 in game, this particular system \u2013 with\nits 9 planets, 66 moons and 12 asteroid belts \u2013 had recently been transferred\nto a player corporation called H A V O C, a corp used by the alliance Pandemic\nLegion to handle sovereignty transfers between Alliances (which are\ncollections of Corporations). Unfortunately, when CONCORD tried to extract the\nISK (EVE\u2019s currency) that would maintain sovereignty in the system for another\nmonth, they found that H A V O C had left their automatic payment unchecked.\nWithout the necessary payment, sovereignty in the system immediately dropped\nleaving the system up for grabs.\n\nMissed bill payments are certainly not new to the human experience nor are\nthey to EVE Online. Human error has caused many a system to lapse. Sometimes\nit merely means that another Territorial Control Unit (a flag of sorts) has to\nbe anchored in space to regain control of the system. Sometimes it means that\nan entire region is lost and an Alliance is disbanded.\n\nThis particular system however happened to be the staging system for all\nPandemic Legion fleets in one of the largest wars to ever be waged in EVE\nOnline. The Halloween War, having waged for months, had been punctuated by\nmany engagements across the vast EVE universe. This single missed payment\nsparked off what would become the most expensive battle in EVE Online history.\nOne pilot\u2019s action (or inaction) had repercussions for the entire universe\u2014a\nbutterfly wing causing a massive typhoon of destruction. Coincidentally, this\noccurred a year to the day of another infamous battle where a single mistake\nby a single player offered destruction on a galactic scale\u2014the Battle of\nAsakai.\n\nSensing this moment of unexpected weakness in a strategically critical\nlocation, the opposing Coalition comprised of the CFC Alliance and Russian-\nheavy coalition forces scrambled to get a foothold in the system. The message\nwent out. Thousands logged in and fleeted up. If the CFC and Russian fleets\ncould capture the station in system, they would trap Pandemic Legion assets\ninside, including hundreds of capital and sub-capital fleet hulls, rendering\nthem unavailable for the wider conflict.\n\nMeanwhile the forces of Pandemic Legion and N3 (a coalition made up Nulli\nSecunda, Northern Coalition. and assorted other allies) tried whatever they\ncould to maintain control of the system. Despite anchoring Territorial Control\nUnits all over the system, opposing forces destroyed them before any of them\ncould online to regain control. In an attempt to at least secure the station,\nPandemic Legion and N3 deployed what capital and super-capital forces they\ncould muster in their patented \u201cWrecking Ball\u201d formation just off the station.\n\nUpon seeing that Pandemic Legion and N3 had a smaller capital and super-\ncapital fleet (due to the surprise nature of the fight and it occurring during\na Monday work day) CFC and Russian forces decided that it was time to seize\nthe opportunity for a decisive fight. Taking into account lessons learned in\nthe massive \u201cBattle of HED-GP\u201d earlier in the week, which had been a\nresounding loss for the CFC and Russian Forces at the hands of the \u201cWrecking\nBall,\u201d they chose this time to seize the initiative and deploy the entirety of\nthe Capital Fleet to gain field superiority before PL and N3 could respond.\nMeanwhile, their sub-capital fleets were deployed to N3 staging systems to\ndelay any reinforcements.\n\nUnlike nearly every other large scale super-capital engagement up till this\npoint, both sides thought they could win. They continued trying to get every\nsingle pilot into system with the most powerful warships they could bring to\nbear. After a few hours, the field was being lit up by doomsdays and the\nglittering hulls of hundreds of Titans and Supercarriers and thousands of\nDreadnaughts and Carriers and smaller ships.\n\nThe battle was relatively even for some time with CFC and Russian forces\nholding moderate lead at first and only have a slight lead in Titan kills.\nThen came a turning point in the battle. Manfred Sideous, the initial Fleet\nCommander for PL/N3, handed over command to the CEO of Northern Coalition.,\nVince Draken. After successfully focusing fire to destroy several CFC/RUS\nTitans and causing some Russian Titans to jump out of the system with shields\nand armor depleted, PL/N3 began to overestimate their success and the primary\ntarget was switched to the Titan of Sort Dragon, one of fourteen members of\nthe current Council of Stellar Management and the man coordinating all the\nRussian Forces left on field. His Titan successfully withstood the onslaught\nmore than any so far with the assistance of his entire fleet actively working\nto repair it and very high damage resistance bonuses. By the time his\nstructure was finally breached, the CFC/RUS forces had killed 5 Titans in\nreturn. From this point on, every volley cycle of the CFC/RUS Titan doomsdays\nput them further and further ahead.\n\nHere\u2019s what it looked like\u2014a particularly good video by a neutral third party\nwitness.\n\nLink: //www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCK-E5AopVI\n\nEventually, after nearly 12 hours of brawling in what had clearly become the\nlongest engagement in online gaming PvP history, the PL/N3 forces sounded the\nretreat. In the ensuing evacuation several more Titans, Super Carriers, and\nCapitals were lost, many trapped by warp disruption bubbles that covered the\nfield\n\nHere\u2019s a shot with the in-game UI showing the action. Each red or orange dot\nis either a ship or a drone.\n\nThroughout the fight, related battles also raged across the universe. Fleets\ntried to prevent reinforcements, kill wounded capitals and super-capitals\nattempting to flee, or trap the brave few who were trying to enter the fight\nand tip the scales.\n\nThe entire fight was watched live on Twitch.tv courtesy of Nick_Fuzzeh of\nPandemic Legion as well as a host of other marathon streamers. In what can\nonly be considered a meta-SciFi moment of more than 12,000 people watching a\nvirtual war unfold live across the internet, his music news ticker,\nand......spooky dancing skeleton graphic entertained as the fight raged on.\n\nCommercial break for more spaceships\n\nWhen the dust finally settled and daily server maintenance downtime ended the\nconflict, all involved were shocked at the devastation. The winning side alone\nhad lost more Titans that in any battle seen before. The losing side had lost\nmore Titans than anyone had previously thought possible.\n\nTITANOMACHY: COMMEMORATING THE FIGHT\n\nAlmost immediately following the fight, players universally clamored for an\nin-game monument. Actually the emails amongst EVE developers demanding the\nsame had already begun. Something of this scale, where the players had left an\nindelible mark on the universe through their extraordinary actions, needed to\nhave something more permanent in game to commemorate it and we are proud to\nhighlight the bravery and commitment of our players to their craft of blowing\nup spaceships.\n\n\u201cTitanomachy\u201d has been created using the brand new Titan wreck models that\nwere introduced with EVE Online: Rubicon\u2019s 1.1 release that was\n(coincidentally) deployed immediately following the battle itself. A permanent\nsite in the game, it will be placed around the seventh planet in the B-R5RB\nsolar system and be \u201coff grid\u201d from the station. Thereafter, any player who\nplays EVE can make the dangerous pilgrimage there and marvel at the scope of\ndestruction. We expect some of the \u201ctravel\u201d bloggers to do full write-ups on\nit almost immediately and EVE videographers to make some moving tributes as\nwell.\n\nWe\u2019re aiming for installation of Titanomachy during downtime of January 31^st,\nand are hard at work placing the wrecks in a hauntingly beautiful arrangement.\n\nYou can read more about the process of creating the new Titan wrecks in this\nnewly published devblog bythe EVE art team. A couple are pictured below. For\nmore information about Rubicon check the feature site. For Rubicon 1.1, check\nout this in-development video, scan the past few dev blogs and read the patch\nnotes. As always, new patches and expansions are free to all paid subscribers.\n\nB-R5RB BY THE NUMBERS\n\n\u00b7 Around 21 hours of total fighting\n\n\u00b7 7,548 unique characters belonging to those two coalitions participated in\nthe overall battle (i.e. landed on at least one killmail). 6,058 participated\ndirectly in the B-R5RB system with 2,670 in system at max\n\n\u00b7 717 unique player Corporations\n\n\u00b7 55 unique player Alliances\n\n(the two dips are missing data)\n\nThe butcher\u2019s bill by the end of the fight was staggering:\n\nTotals destroyed:\n\n\u00b7 Titans \u2013 75 (74 in system, one on its way to the fight) N3/PL lost 59 titans\nand CFC/DTF lost 16 titans\n\n\u00b7 Titan losses by type: Gallente Erebus \u2013 37, Amarr Avatar \u2013 25, Minmatar\nRagnarok \u2013 13, Caldari Leviathan - 0\n\n\u00b7 Supercarriers \u2013 13 (12 in system, one as it tried to escape the system)\n\n\u00b7 Dreadnaughts \u2013 370 (356 in system, 14 in connected skirmishes as both sides\nattempted to stop the other from bringing reinforcements)\n\n\u00b7 Carriers \u2013 123 (109 in system, 14 in connected skirmishes as both sides\nattempted to stop the other from bringing reinforcements)\n\n\u00b7 And lots more smaller ships and probably a bajilion drones and fighters\n\nIn comparison, the previous record for largest single battle Titan losses was\na tie between battles in \u201cO2O\u201d and \u201cUemon\u201d, with 12 total Titans destroyed in\neach.\n\nApproximately 775 doomsdays were fired, which is about 24% of all the\ndoomsdays fired in the last two years inclusive. The Battle for HED-GP, which\npreceeded this one in the Halloween War, had about 200 doomsdays.\n\nThe Economic Impact\n\n11 TRILLION ISK.\n\nAccording to some PLEX conversions that could equate to approximately\n$300,000-$330,000 USD.\n\nIntel!\n\nNote that these are filled with EVE Online-specific jargon and terms and can\nat times include colorful language. The light that they shed on the operations\nof these massive fleets by the people behind them is nonetheless fascinating.\n\nManfred Sideous\u2019 AMA on Reddit.

Without some help, it would have been entirely too\nmuch to take and we wouldn\u2019t be here talking about a bunch of exploded\nspaceships. In EVE, we know that fights like this are a major deciding factor\nin large-scale warfare, so in order to support them the best we can we\nintroduced a system called Time Dilation. Its job is to give the server the\nmeans to control the amount of load an insane-scale fight like this causes.\n\nThe mechanism behind Time Dilation is reasonably simple \u2013 if the server cannot\nkeep up with the load of simulation, it slows down time in the solar systems\nit\u2019s managing. For example, if there\u2019s twice as much going on than the server\ncan normally handle, it\u2019s got the ability to run that heavy simulation at half\nspeed, bring the rate of load back to something manageable. Due to how we set\nup our universe, the effect of this slowdown is localized, often applying to\njust the problematic system and allowing the vast majority of other online\nplayers to continue on as happy as can be blowing up ships, mining, trading,\nexploring etc as long as they didn\u2019t come near these massive fights.\n\nWith the length and intensity of this fight however, this slowdown was not\nenough to completely cover it, so it hit our limit of running the simulation\nat 10% of normal time. Consequently, over the 21 hours players experienced of\nthe fight, the server was put to task to run just over 2 hours worth of\nsimulation. It was much more able to fulfil that task than if it had to handle\nit all in real time, which ultimately gave players a smoother, more\npredictable experience than would take place otherwise.\n\nFly Safe\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the largest single battle in terms of numbers of participants in\nsystem at once. That record still belongs to the battle for 6VDT-H, which\nreached 4,070 pilots in system.\n\nA final note. EVE has been growing in subscribers every year since it started,\nfor nearly 11 years straight. The way the game is set up you could join now\nand possibly be at the forefront of one of these battles. Or you could avoid\nthis level of gameplay altogether and forge your own path.

You might find people\naround the globe you enjoy flying with and find worthy of slugging it out for\n21 hours straight on behalf of. You might be the next person making that\nsingle mistake that causes thousands of people to hurtle their ships at you or\nyou might be the person that catches that next mistake and becomes the hero of\nthe day.\n\nAdvice for new players: ask questions of vets and advice from them, don\u2019t be\nafraid to look for answers on the internet, and try to find someone to fly\nwith whether a friend from another game that starts at the same time, someone\nyou know in real life, or one of the many corporations that recruit in game.\nIt is a multiplayer game after all. EVE is a game that challenges you in a way\nthat others just don\u2019t, as I\u2019m sure you gathered from this writeup.
