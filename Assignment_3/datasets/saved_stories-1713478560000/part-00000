It's a\nquestion that often goes unasked. We power on our devices, run programs, and\ninteract with the digital world, assuming we're the ones in charge or perhaps\nnot even pondering the matter. But this control we believe we have is nothing\nmore than an illusion, a facade carefully crafted by proprietary software.\n\nProprietary software operates under a veil of secrecy. Its inner workings are\nhidden, and its source code is a guarded secret accessible only to the\ndeveloper who made it. This translates directly into a lack of control for\nyou, the user. You are not just limited but bound by the restrictions imposed\nby the developer, confined by their vision and rules to do or not do whatever\nthey say. This is not just a lack of control; it's a feeling of being trapped,\nof being at the mercy of someone else's decisions.\n\nLet's dissect these restrictions and expose the control they strip away:\n\n1\\. Restrictions on Use: Proprietary software licenses may limit the number of\ninstallations, restrict commercial use, the type of hardware you can run it\non, or even dictate how you can use it. Imagine a calendar program that says\nabortion clinics can't use it for scheduling. Whatever the activity, someone\nsomewhere may find an issue with it. The only answer is that we can't allow\nsuch restrictions on use. This fundamentally undermines your freedom to be in\ncontrol of the software rather than the other way around. Imagine purchasing a\ncar but being told you can only drive it on certain roads or at certain times\nof the day. Such restrictions would be absurd, yet many seem to accept them\nwithout question in software.\n\n2\\. Restrictions on Modification: Imagine wanting to tweak a program to suit\nyour needs better, add a feature, fix a frustrating bug, or remove something\nthat you don't like. Proprietary software slams the door on this possibility.\nYou are forced to rely on the developer to implement changes, leaving you at\nthe mercy of their priorities and timelines. This lack of control means you\ncannot adapt the software to your unique workflow or address specific needs.\nInstead, you find yourself pleading with the developers, \"Please, almighty\ndeveloper, please make this change,\" hoping they might hear your pleas and\ndeem them worthy of their attention. This power dynamic places you in a\nsubservient position, subject to the whims of the corporation. You are not in\ncontrol; you are at their mercy.\n\nEven if you decide to switch to another proprietary software program, you are\nmerely changing masters. You have yet to escape the inherent control that\nproprietary software exerts. You remain within the confines of a system that\nprioritizes the developer's interests over the users' freedom.\n\n3\\. Restrictions on Sharing: Sharing software with a friend or colleague\nbecomes an ethical and legal tightrope with proprietary software. The ability\nto help others and collaborate freely is stifled, creating an environment of\nisolation and dependence. Imagine if you couldn't lend a book to a friend or\nshare a recipe with a neighbor. Proprietary software imposes similar barriers.\nThis lack of sharing restricts collaboration and community building, further\nisolating users and reinforcing the developer's control.\n\nAs discussed in The Price of Convenience, proprietary software can lure people\nwith the promise of convenience. It's pre-packaged, seemingly ready to use out\nof the box. However, this convenience comes at a steep cost - your freedom.\nYou become dependent on the developer for everything from updates to bug fixes\nand everything else. This dependence creates a just power imbalance. The\nillusion of convenience masks the reality of control and dependence.\n\nBeyond the Individual: The ramifications of proprietary software extend far\nbeyond individual users. It impacts society as a whole. What you use shows\nothers that it is okay. When people use programs like GitHub or other examples\nwhere proprietary software is needed to do anything, you're not just using it;\nyou're helping it spread, creating barriers, and concentrating power in the\nhands of the developer. Schools and universities become facilities for\nteaching people that it's okay to be controlled by and dependent on\nproprietary software, and also limiting their ability to provide quality\neducation. The control exerted by proprietary software also stifles innovation\nand exacerbates social inequalities. This is not just about you; it's about\nthe society we live in and the future we want to create.\n\nWhy does this matter? This isn't a technical issue; it's an ethical one. Free\nsoftware champions the principles of user freedom. It empowers you to study,\nmodify, and share your software. This fosters an environment where users are\nin control of their computing. This is the vision of the free software\nmovement. I urge you to consider these points and take a step towards using\nfree software, thereby supporting the movement and reclaiming control over\nyour digital life.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Jason Self.
