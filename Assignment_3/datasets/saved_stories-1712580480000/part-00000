At the\ntime of publication, it represented the best available science.\n\nSeptember 23, 2015JPEG\n\nAn astronaut aboard the International Space Station took this nighttime\npanorama while looking north across Pakistan\u2019s Indus River valley. The port\ncity of Karachi is the bright cluster of lights facing the Arabian Sea, which\nappears completely black. City lights and the dark color of dense agriculture\nclosely track with the great curves of the Indus valley. For scale, the\ndistance from Karachi to the foothills of the Himalaya Mountains is 1,160\nkilometers (720 miles).\n\nThis photograph shows one of the few places on Earth where an international\nboundary can be seen at night. The winding border between Pakistan and India\nis lit by security lights that have a distinct orange tone. Another night\nimage (click here) shows the border zone looking southeast from the Himalaya.\nA daylight view shows the vegetated bends of the Indus Valley winding through\nthe otherwise desert country.\n\nMore than two millennia ago, Alexander the Great entered the Indus plains in\n327 BCE from the northwest. He then spent many months leading his army and\nnavy down the length of the Indus valley shown in this view. From near\nKarachi, he then began the desert march back to Mesopotamia (modern Iraq). By\ncontrast, it takes the space station just three minutes to travel this\ndistance.\n\nAstronaut photograph ISS045-E-27869 was acquired on September 23, 2015, with a\nNikon D4 digital camera using a 28 millimeter lens, and is provided by the ISS\nCrew Earth Observations Facility and the Earth Science and Remote Sensing\nUnit, Johnson Space Center. The image was taken by a member of the Expedition\n45 crew. The image has been cropped and enhanced to improve contrast, and lens\nartifacts have been removed. The International Space Station Program supports\nthe laboratory as part of the ISS National Lab to help astronauts take\npictures of Earth that will be of the greatest value to scientists and the\npublic, and to make those images freely available on the Internet. Additional\nimages taken by astronauts and cosmonauts can be viewed at the NASA/JSC\nGateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth. Caption by M.
