You walk around, and it seems fine? There\u2019s a slight pinch in the right\ntoe but it\u2019s so mild, you tell yourself. I barely notice it.\n\nKnowingless is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and\nsupport my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.\n\nBut start wearing the shoes, and that tiny, barely-there bump you felt in the\nbeginning grows after repeated, subtle rubbing. It starts to hurt, and you\u2019re\nlike, fuck, should not have ignored that in the store.\n\nThere was lots of incentive to ignore that in the store, though. You were\nexcited about how neat the shoes looked. You imagined other people seeing you\nin those shoes and being impressed. You were taken in by the department store\nsmells and how squeaky clean the shoes looked and smelled. You loved how good\nit felt to walk in them.\n\nBut here, in actual use, the tiny warning signs have turned into big blisters,\nand now you\u2019re limping.\n\nAnd the shoe doesn\u2019t want to be taken off. It absolutely refuses to allow you\nto try on a new shoe. And you\u2019re out in the middle of your hike now, and\ngetting a new shoe would be a drag - you\u2019d have go all the way back, find a\nnew shoe, and start your hike all over again. And maybe then you\u2019d even have\nthe same problems! How do you know the new pair wouldn\u2019t end up blistering you\njust the same, except now you\u2019re back at the beginning of your hike and you\u2019ve\nwasted half the day? Can you really trust yourself to know which early twinges\nare ones to notice, especially when you\u2019re hot with excitement?\n\nAnd it can get bad. Your entire gait sort of crumples a bit to try to\ncompensate for the pain. Maybe your knee or hip or ankle starts hurting; the\nrest of your body begins to suffer as you warp your stride to try to make the\nshoes hurt a little bit less. You have to keep going, after all. You\u2019re just\ntrying to find the way to move forward that\u2019s tolerable. You didn\u2019t know it\nwas going to be this bad when you tried the shoes on in the store, but you\ncouldn\u2019t have known. Could you?\n\nIt has to get really bad for you to consider going barefoot. If you peel off\nthe shoes they will be very sad, and now your feet will be single and meeting\nthe rough ground of life without aid. Those shoes were blistering your heel or\nknocking into your toenail so badly, but the rest of your foot was cushioned\nand floating painlessly along the ground. How bad does it have to be to make\ngoing barefoot worth it?\n\nMaybe it\u2019s frustrating. Maybe it seems like all the shoes do this. Some\npeople\u2019s feet are more sensitive and soft than others, more likely to be\nblistered by shoes that other people can just throw on and run off with. You\nask people \u201cHow do you find a shoe that won\u2019t hurt me?\u201d and people say \u201cget\none with padding\u201d, and you get one with padding but somehow this seems to make\nthe blistering worse somehow?\n\n(Or maybe you\u2019re very lucky, and it\u2019s not that hard to find shoes that don\u2019t\nblister! Maybe your feet are solid and not easily damaged. Or if you\u2019re even\nmore lucky, over time you figure out the kinds of traits in shoes less likely\nto blister you, and this valuable piece of knowledge makes your future steps\nso much smoother.)\n\nMaybe you shouldn\u2019t go barefoot though - maybe you should push through it, and\nover time you\u2019ll develop callouses. Your feet will grow hard, scarlike tissue\nto resist the repeated chafing.\n\nOr maybe the shoe will eventually soften and mold to your foot.\n\nThe worst part is it\u2019s hard to know. How far should you travel with the shoe\nbefore deciding you should go barefoot instead? Do you really want to walk in\nthe shoes for a long time, praying they\u2019ll eventually stop hurting, only to\nfind they haven\u2019t stopped? You talked to a friend who swore their shoes became\nawesome after a few years of walking in them, you just need to keep at it. You\ndon\u2019t wanna be one of those people who throws away their shoes at the first\nlittle sign of pain. But how do you know that journey will be the same for\nyou?\n\nIt\u2019s so hard to know how much pain is normal. Are you genuinely unlucky with\nshoes, or are you a wimp with unreasonable expectations? You can sometimes\ncompare actual damage to feet - showing your own blister or callous to someone\nelse. This doesn\u2019t work for pain in your knee or hip though, the hard ways\nyou\u2019ve adjusted your life to avoid any damage from the shoe itself. Those ways\nare invisible.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not bleeding\u201d, you say, showing your feet, but privately wonder if\nthis is just because you\u2019re suppressing who your natural walk in order to\navoid the damage in the first place.\n\nIt\u2019s also unclear how much is the type of shoe. Some people wear high heels\nand laugh when you ask about it; \u201cit\u2019s worth the way I feel in them\u201d, they say\n(though some seem like they\u2019re just trying to fit in; this is what it means to\nbe feminine). Other people wear casual flats meant for comfort and lounging\nand sidewalks, that work wonderfully as long as they stick to sidewalks.\nOthers wear hefty hiking boots meant for rugged terrain, which is impressive\nbut maybe overkill. You\u2019re not sure which kind of shoe is right for you. Are\nyou just accidentally picking up the wrong kind of shoe for your lifestyle?\n\nAnd maybe this is all sad, but how much of it is in your head? You\u2019re\nsurrounded by stories of people who\u2019ve had their same pair of shoes for\ntwenty, thirty years. At this point the shoes are practically the skin on\ntheir feet. \u201cPersisting was worth it,\u201d they say happily, and you believe them,\nthough you notice an occasional cane in the happy crowd, just common enough to\ninject into you a little suspicion.\n\nAnd now and then you run across someone who went barefoot a long time ago and\nnever bothered to stop by a store to grab some new shoes. Their feet are\ncalloused now, toes splayed out for gripping, and they seem to be doing okay.\n\u201cYeah the tradeoff is sometimes I get a glass shard in there; it\u2019s harder to\nhandle unexpected problems with my bare feet alone. But I don\u2019t really need\nshoes anymore. If I happen to find some shoes on the ground that fit, sure why\nnot - but I\u2019m not going out of my way.\u201d\n\nThis seems great and peaceful, though you notice their toes have grown wide\nand strong - too big to fit comfortably into storebought shoes anymore. You\nwonder if being barefoot so long has actually made it harder to find shoes\nthat don\u2019t hurt.\n\nKnowingless is a reader-supported publication.

Romantic relationships are a lot more about power than\nthey are about \"love\", much like religion itself, and pointing out how human\nsexuality actually works in a way that contradicts the ideals of romance is\noften treated like blasphemy.Expand full commentLike (7)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n4 replies\n\nWillWorkerJul 4, 2023While I understood this analogy when I read it, something\nfelt off.It's like there's some kind of uncanny valley with it. All the parts\nlook right and fit neatly together, but there's something missing that causes\nthe intuition to bristle (enough that it got some free rent in my head for a\nday or so).The problem is every experiential reason I could think of as to why\nthe metaphor doesn't fully intuit nonetheless resulted in it rotating into\nposition with marginal effort. Be a pickier shopper. Inoculate one's self\nagainst the razzle-dazzle of the store and fashion expectations. Give up\nshopping for shoes, only to find a great pair at the grocery store a week\nlater. Steal someone else's shoes.The only common thread I can think of\nbetween them is some sort of impulse to scream, \"Fuck shoe stores!\". Maybe\nit's that there is already unnecessary rigidity in how society generally\ndefines relationships that also carries through to the metaphor. And it is\nthat rigidity which needs to be rejected, which is why the metaphor\nchafes.Expand full commentLike (5)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n3 replies\n\n46 more comments...\n\nMy Birthday Gangbang\n\na slutistical breakdown\n\nMar 1 \u2022\n\nAella\n\n222\n\nShare this post\n\n#### My Birthday Gangbang\n\naella.substack.com\n\n18\n\nHow To Be Good At Sex: Starve Her Brain (pt1)\n\nA guide for men in bed\n\nOct 18, 2023 \u2022\n\nAella\n\n235\n\nShare this post\n\n#### How To Be Good At Sex: Starve Her Brain (pt1)\n\naella.substack.com\n\n35\n\nFetish Tabooness vs Popularity\n\n~250 fetishes, graphed for your pleasure\n\nSep 24, 2022 \u2022\n\nAella\n\n84\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Fetish Tabooness vs Popularity\n\naella.substack.com\n\n5\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Aella\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
