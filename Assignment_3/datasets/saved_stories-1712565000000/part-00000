Police\nsent in two other robots often used for bomb disposal into the house to find\nthe suspect along with Roscoe.\n\nThe robot dog, which was controlled remotely by state troopers, first checked\nthe two main floors before finding someone in the basement. The person, armed\nwith a rifle, twice knocked over Roscoe before shooting it three times,\ndisabling its communication.\n\nThe person then shot at one of the other robots and an outdoor swimming pool\nbefore police deployed tear gas and arrested them.\n\n\u201cThe incident provided a stark example of the benefits of mobile platforms\ncapable of opening doors and ascending stairs in tactical missions involving\narmed suspects,\u201d state police said in a statement. \u201cIn addition to providing\ncritically important room clearance and situational awareness capabilities,\nthe insertion of Roscoe into the suspect residence prevented the need, at that\nstage of response, from inserting human operators, and may have prevented a\npolice officer from being involved in an exchange of gunfire.\u201d\n\nBoston Dynamics, the company that made the SPOT robot, said in a statement\nthat it was the first time one of them had been shot.\n\n\u201cWe are relieved that the only casualty that day was our robot,\u201d the company\nsaid. \u201cIt\u2019s a great example of how mobile robots like Spot can be used to save\nlives.\u201d\n\nAuthorities have not identified the shooter or said what charges they face.\n\nRoscoe was sent to Boston Dynamics to remove the bullets. It will remain with\nthe company and a new unit will be sent to state police.\n\nSubscribe to the Eye on AI newsletter to stay abreast of how AI is shaping the\nfuture of business.
