The economy declined by\n3.3 percent in the previous three months, meaning the country entered a\ntechnical recession.\n\nWith a GDP of $4.5 trillion, Germany now sits behind the United States and\nChina in terms of economic heft, and narrowly leads Japan, which has a GDP of\n$4.2 trillion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGermany's economy shrank by 0.3 percent in 2023, with \"rising interest rates\nand weaker domestic and foreign demand\" to blame, according to the Federal\nStatistics Office.\n\nHowever, last October, the International Monetary Fund projected that\nGermany's GDP would indeed eclipse that of Japan in 2024, as the yen's slide\nagainst the dollar continues to cause headaches for policymakers in Tokyo.\n\nThough it has long been Europe's largest economy, the last time Germany held\nthe number three spot was in 2007, before it was overtaken by China.\n\nRelated Tags\n\nAsia economy Currencies Currency Economic performance Global economy Growth\nInterest rates Monetary Policy U.S. economy\n\nRelated Countries\n\nChina Germany Japan United States\n\nRelated Organizations\n\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)\n\n## Our readers read next\n\nCartoon Carousel\n\n## World\u2019s cartoonists on this week\u2019s events\n\n12 HRS ago 1 min read\n\n## Euro plunges, eyes parity with dollar after Lagarde\u2019s go-it-alone pledge\n\n22 HRS ago 4 mins read\n\n## Bank of England\u2019s forecasting needs urgent revamp, says ex-US Fed chief\nBernanke\n\nApr 12 4 mins read\n\n## Why Germany\u2019s Scholz is bowing to the Chinese dragon\n\nApr 12 10 mins read\n\n## More from Seb Starcevic\n\n## Westminster \u2018honey trap\u2019 scandal: Tory MP Wragg resigns from top roles\nafter leaking numbers\n\nHe admitted he was targeted by a scammer on Grindr and had given out the\npersonal phone numbers of a number of other MPs, who were later also targeted.\n\nApr 9 2 mins read\n\n## France, Egypt, Jordan jointly call for \u2018unconditional\u2019 Gaza cease-fire\n\nEmmanuel Macron, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and King Abdullah seek end to \u201cthe\ncatastrophic human suffering\u201d and a 2-state solution.\n\nApr 9 2 mins read\n\n## Which of your fave Taylor Swift, Drake and Beyonc\u00e9 songs has Chechnya\nbanned?\n\nThe Eras Tour won\u2019t be coming to Grozny anytime soon.\n\nApr 8 4 mins read\n\n## Macron to acknowledge France\u2019s failure to stop Rwanda genocide\n\nIt\u2019s the 30th anniversary of the humanitarian tragedy, which saw the mass\nmurder of an estimated 800,000 people.\n\nApr 5 2 mins read\n\n", "frontpage": false}
