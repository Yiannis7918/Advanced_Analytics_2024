We\u2019re presently at the end of the post-WW-2 order (or the post-\nbroadcasting order), sort of nervously contemplating what happens next. There\nhas been an active clerisy of nerdoids in place since the 1930s before the\nwar: FDR implemented this idea of a nerdoid clerisy in its current form.\nHerbert Hoover offered a different nerdoid clerisy -he was an excellent\nengineer and administrator and was more effective than what replaced him. FDRs\nnerds were arguably a failure from the start: FDR\u2019s clerisy put the \u201cGreat\u201d in\n\u201cGreat Depression.\u201d\n\nYou know who didn\u2019t have a Great Depression? Knuckle dragging anti-\nintellectual fascisti, that\u2019s who: people who were sans clerisy. Literal beer\nhall philosophers. The US clerisy did take credit for winning WW-2. Whether or\nnot they did anything useful is questionable: the Russians did most of the\nactual fighting. The US had the foresight to build nukes and ramp up military\nproduction to help the Russians kill our enemies (and themselves -an important\nunspoken goal of WW2) for us. Some of this plan was executed by various kinds\nof bureaucrat-nerd, but few to none of the important decisions were made by\nsuch people, who probably supported the communists on principle. Nukes would\nhave been built without Oppenheimer, but probably wouldn\u2019t have without the\nmostly unsung Leslie Groves who did all of the important leadership work,\nincluding hiring Oppenheimer.\n\nI bet Groves gave Oppie noogies when out of range of the cameras: the weak\nshould fear the strong\n\nGroves was 0% nerd race; he was an Army engineer, a type of cultured thug who\nhas existed since the late Stone Age. He had zero tolerance for nerdoid\nbullshit, and you can see how hard he mogs Oppie in the photo above. Groves is\nthe type of man leaders have relied on for all of human history, and quite a\nfew centuries before. Groves, to put it in American terms, was more of a\nCaptain of the Football team than he was a nerd. The same can be said of other\ntechnical work done in Radar. Nerds had little to do with American victory in\na \u201ccalling the shots\u201d sense. They helped: but only because they were told what\nto do and kept under strict control by the Captain of the Football team.\nSubsequently, nerds and their bureaucracies flourished in the US, essentially\ncargo-culting what happened in WW-2, leaving out the all-important urgency and\naccountability to the Captain of the Football team who mercilessly bullycided\nthem into producing results on a timeline, as is correct and proper.\n\nAfter American victory, nerds proliferated like cockroaches, and to this\nproliferation was attributed a lot of the postwar American financial and\nindustrial dominance. American financial and industrial dominance was more\nreadily attributed to the fact that it held the world\u2019s gold and the only\nfunctioning factories that hadn\u2019t been bombed to cinders. The proliferation of\nnerds and nerd institutions was a result of prosperity; not a driver of it.\nYou can make new nerds more easily than we do now should we happen to need\nmore; the sciences did better when a Ph.D. was unnecessary or a brief\napprenticeship. This compared to the present system where science nerds aren\u2019t\neven paper productive almost until their 30s, and are often still kissing ass\nand publishing bullshit papers to get tenure in their 40s.\n\nA historical example of astounding governmental success: the East India\ncompany (the US was modeled after it; the flag anyway). None of the men in it\nwere nerds. All of them were Leslie Grove types. British gentlemen, while\noften superbly educated in the classics and in technical fields, were not\nnerds. The British elite were known by continentals to be anti-intellectual.\nThen you go look at the situation where nerds run everything: Wiemar Germany,\ncurrent year, any random 1000 years of shitty Chinese history, peak Gosplan\nSoviet times. Nerd leadership isn\u2019t good. Nerds belong in the laboratory. If\nthey\u2019re not in the laboratory they should be bullycided. Even when in the lab\nthey need to be held accountable for producing good results; nerds will always\ntell you some bullshit story about their fuckups. That includes bureaucrat\nnerds pushing bits and paper. Do something useful with matter or GTFO. Nerds\nlike Robert McNamera come up with failson do-everything products like the\nF-111, the golden dodo-bird of its time. Not-nerds who put their ass on the\nline like John Boyd come up with the F-16; after almost 40 years, still the\nbackbone of Western air forces.\n\nThe same is true in tech leadership. Most of the leaders of nerds who matter\nare not really nerds, even if they fake it for the troops. Zuck does Brazool\nJiu Jitsu and kills goats: he ain\u2019t doing leetcode pull requests. Elon was a\nstreet fighter before he developed his interest in payment systems and\nrockets, and his personal life is more like Andrew Tates than that of a nerd.\nThe nerds who founded google and kept it an engineering company in its early\ndays hired a womanizing chad to make it a useful company, and speaking of\nLarry types, Larry Ellison is both a womanizing saleschad and lunatic jet\npilot rather than a nerd. Look at the most prominent actual nerd entrepreneur\nin recent history: Sam Bankman Fiend. Archetypical nerd; he even worked at\nuber-nerdy Jane Street and had filthy sex orgies with other ugly nerdoids.\nNerds need to be bullycided. It\u2019s good for them, good for the organizations\nthey work for.\n\nBeing intelligent isn\u2019t the same as being a nerd. Though nerdism is touted as\nbeing a sort of definition of intelligence: it isn\u2019t. Being a nerd is being a\ndisembodied brain; a king of abstraction. Being a nerd is a lifestyle open to\nobvious stupidians. Even when they\u2019re bright, nerds lack thumos; they have a\nhard time operating outside the nerd herd. If something is declared \u201cstupid\u201d\nthe nerd won\u2019t give it a second thought. If other nerds like a thing, or are\ndeclared \u201cexpert,\u201d even the 200 IQ nerd will go along with it, because being a\nnerd is his identity. This is why the football star is superior to the nerd:\nhis life isn\u2019t made of abstractions -it\u2019s made of winning, which is something\nthat happens when you\u2019re right, not when you do the proper nerd-correct thing\nto sit at the nerd table in high school. Right now there are probably a\nhundreds thousand nerds trying to predict the stock market with ChatGPT (aka\nautocomplete). That\u2019s what a nerd does: acts on propaganda as if it is real\ninformation. Chad either exploits a bunch of ChatGPT specialists and flips it\nas a business to a greater fool, or invents a new branch of mathematics to\nbeat the market the way Ed Thorp did.\n\nObjectivity is another thing the nerd lacks. Nerds are masters of dogma.\nThey\u2019re good at putting dogma into their brains: that\u2019s in one sense what\n\u201cbook learning\u201d is -you have a sort of resonator in your noggin that easily\nlatches into patterns. People who are good at tests are good at absorbing\npropaganda. They\u2019re bad at noticing the thing they absorbed is propaganda;\nthat takes another personality type. One that nerds associate with \u201cstupid\npeople\u201d who bullied them in high school. You know, the ones who should be\ntheir bosses.\n\nNerds become in love with their ideas, even when they\u2019re wrong. Architecture\nastronauts, mRNA enthusiasts, marxists and other schools of economics, diet\nloons, snake-oil pharmaceutical salesmen, \u201cexperts\u201d in most fields -these are\nideologies that people can\u2019t course correct without losing face. Since being\n\u201csmart\u201d is all a nerd has, they stick with shitty ideas even unto their actual\ndeaths. Actually intelligent people play with ideas, consider where they might\nbe useful and where they might break down. Ideas are like wrenches; they\u2019re\nnot useful in every situation, and you have to pick the right one for the job.\nYou have to put down the wrong wrench and pick a screwdriver sometimes. That\u2019s\nwhy you need a General Groves to manage the nerds: your legions of shrieking\nnerd wrench-enthusiasts can be helpful in putting together a car, they need to\nbe bullycided into not using a wrench to install rivets or screws. The other\nuseful management technique is to pair them with machinists who will make fun\nof them for trying to use a wrench for everything: the China Lake approach.\n\nIt\u2019s OK to be a nerd; nerds can serve a purpose. We can even admire the nerd\nif he\u2019s actually capable of rational thought. It\u2019s not OK to give nerds\nleadership positions. You need people who played sports or who killed people\nfor a living, or otherwise interacted with matter and the real world. The\ncleric doesn\u2019t order the warrior in a functioning society; it\u2019s the other way\naround.\n\nExamples of nerd failure:\n\nhttps://gaiusbaltar.substack.com/p/why-is-the-west-so-weak-and-russia\n\nhttps://archive.is/20240107140058/https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-01-07/2024-elections-\nin-taiwan-eu-uk-us-and-elsewhere-threaten-democracy\n\nhttps://collabfund.com/blog/the-dumber-side-of-smart-people/\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Facebook\n  * X\n  * Reddit\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### Related\n\nHistorical censorship attempts and shifting elitesAugust 19, 2023In \"history\"\n\nWilliam R.

Einstein produced the work he\u2019s most well-known\nfor at age 26. What scientists really need to produce original, useful results\nis autonomy\u2013a lot more could be said about this, looking to Bell Labs as a\nmore recent model for producing useful research.\n\nThe modern system is vastly more formalized, rigidly structured, and dogmatic\nthan the systems that came before it, and still hasn\u2019t figured out the\ndistinction between rote memorization vs general understanding by way of\nprinciples, something the Greeks worked out thousands of years ago. The modern\nsystem genuinely believes that there\u2019s no real distinction between rote\nmemorization and general intelligence (which might explain a lot of the hype\naround chatGPT), and prefers to promote students who are the best memorizers\nrather than people capable of synthesizing and applying new ideas.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that sports and philosophy is a better base for leadership\nthan \u201cstudying\u201d or whatever you call sitting around alone memorizing tables of\ncrystal structures.\n\nReply\n\n     * William O.

If the siloviki actually planned the initial invasion well, then Russia\ncould\u2019ve received a new 30 million Slavs, a releatively undamaged\ninfrastructure, a Black Sea lake, and strongly refocus on domestic reforms.\nInstead, it\u2019s stuck in a costly quagmire where the biggest territorial gains\nnow are dilapidated, abandoned rust belt villages. What\u2019s even worse is that\nRussia risks Kiev, Odessa falling permanently out of its orbit if this anemic\nrate does not change. Letting another potential pole for Orthodox Eastern\nSlavs emerge is a terrible strategic blow to your monopoly on this type of\ncivilization.\n\n>Singapore, Park era South Korea, Dubai, Putl0r era Russia, Pinochet era\nChile, Bukele era El Salvador\n\nI specifically mentioned \u201cdecent size country\u201d to avoid discussion of city-\nstates like Dubai (yes I know Dubai is part of UAE and not a city state alone)\nand Singapore. Park era South Korea, Pinochet era Chile were transitory\nphenomenons that proved lacking in having permanence just like nerd free\nFrancoist Spain and Salazar Portugal. They proved unable to buck the nerd\nworld order and folded into joining it. Bukele is early and has only faced bad\npress from Nerd Inc. and need to wait for more significant challenges are\nposed to see how robust his system is. Putin would\u2019ve been okay but like I\noutlined above he really bungled the invasion and the Nerds are freely\noperating east of Kharkov now. Time will tell, but siloviki messing up\nsomething so important as the invasion is a big testament against the \u201cnon-\nsense\u201d culture they are suppose to bring while the nerds in the economic\nministry were blindsided by the actual invasion and still pulled it off.\n\nReply\n\n         * Scott Locklin said, on April 1, 2024 at 6:03 pm\n\nI don\u2019t think the Russian central bankers are nerds; they\u2019re too effective.\n\nI also don\u2019t think the Russians fucked up the invasion, though I know nerds\nwould like us to think Putl0r will be gone in two more weeks.

Perhaps they are nerds; they must have some Leslie\nGroves pointing a gun at them and making the actual decisions.\n\nAs for the invasion I had this argument with a bunch of people and predicted\nexactly what happened: the russians would walk in, take what they wanted, sit\nthere, stubbornly refusing to adhere to the dipshit western narrative that\nPutl0r is stupid Hitler: exactly like they did in Georgia a few years\npreviously.

Minh said, on April 4, 2024 at 8:29 am\n\nOne other area where nerds fail heavily is Networking, one of my main gigs.\nThe problem with nerds, besides the lack of spirit/soul, is that they\u2019re\nmostly reductionists, even when some of them claim to be total thinkers.\nThat\u2019s why they screwed up the Internet addressing architecture with this\ndisgusting abomination called IPv6. This monstrosity was introduced by ivory-\ntower nerds who thought the solution to the problem of IP address depletion\nwas making the address space infinitely bigger, and to hell with everything\nelse. Reductionist thinking at its ugliest.\n\nNeedless to say, people who deal with real things, on the ground, opposed this\nmadness and put up a great, heroic struggle for 30 years. But the ruling nerds\npersisted, and tried all possible methods under the sun to slam their\ninsufferable love-child down everyone\u2019s throats, including the use of\ntechnical threats and blatant lies about IPv6\u2019s capabilities. Recently, with\nthe help of Big Techs who own the Cloud, they\u2019re trying a new gimmick:\ncharging people for the use of IPv4, in an attempt to coerce IPv6 adoption.\nThey think going after people\u2019s pocket will be the much-needed final solution\nto enforce compliance. The hi-tech version of naked terrorism.\n\nIndeed, looks like as a social force, the nerds have been getting stronger\nover the years (probably by design), and they\u2019re ruling just about all\nmainstream aspects of Western societies now. So what we can expect, is for the\nsocial downturn to continue from here on out.\n\nAnother thing I find irritating about them nerds, is they tend to \u201ctrust the\nscience\u201d, to the point of total blindness. These easy-going folks, always with\na gentle smile on their face, were among the most vocal in advocating for the\nCovid jab 3 yrs ago. They also think Bill Gates is generally a nice guy who\nworks for the betterment of humanity, the Rockefellers and the WEF standing\nbehind the scamdemic, the clot-shot and the Great Reset, are just conspiracy\ntheory, the soul doesn\u2019t exist \u2014 it\u2019s all just biochemistry \u2014 and fundamental\nphysics, you know, mathematical trash the likes of Quantum Gravity and\nStandard Model, amount to something grand that will enlarge our understanding\nof the world and the universe, rather than just a form of worthless bread and\ncircus. Oh, and some of them think Quantum Computing poses a real threat to\nour cyber security so it\u2019s good to have regulations in place to combat this\nall too tangible threat.\n\nReply\n\n  20.

FWIIW he\nwas way more right about security issues than Oppenheimer was; the latter\nfigure deserved to be stripped of his security clearance as it was basically\nhis fault the Russians got the bomb as quickly as they did.
