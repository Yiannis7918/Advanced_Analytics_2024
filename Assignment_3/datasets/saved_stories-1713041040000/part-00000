In fact, Italy\u2019s industry\nminister says the decision actually violates Italian law, and he\u2019s actually\nnot wrong.\n\n#### Related Content\n\nStellantis Says Canada Isn't Holding Up its End of the Deal\n\nHang Out In Alfa Romeo's Secret Vault For The Next Hour\n\nThe Chrysler 300C Ends Production\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nview video\n\nThe Chrysler 300C Ends Production\n\nEarlier this week, the debilitatingly-Italnin automaker revealed its new\nMilano small SUV, named after the northern Italian city of Milan, where Alfa\nwas founded in 1910. There\u2019s just one problem: Stellantis wants to build the\nMilano in its Tychy plant in Poland, according to Reuters. It would be the\nfirst Alfa Romeo to ever be entirely built outside of Italy. Again, there is a\nlaw on the books in Italy that forbids this type of thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Related Content\n\nStellantis Says Canada Isn't Holding Up its End of the Deal\n\nHang Out In Alfa Romeo's Secret Vault For The Next Hour\n\nThe Chrysler 300C Ends Production\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nThe Chrysler 300C Ends Production\n\nHere\u2019s more from Reuters on just why you cannot build \u201cItalian sounding\u201d\nproducts outside of Italy, and what the country\u2019s Minister of Economic\nDevelopment had to say about it:\n\n> \u201cA car called Milano cannot be produced in Poland. This is forbidden by\n> Italian law,\u201d Adolfo Urso said in Turin, referring to 2003 legislation that\n> targets \u201cItalian sounding\u201d products that falsely claim to be Italian.\n>\n> \u201cThis law stipulates that you cannot give indications that mislead\n> consumers. So a car called Milano must be produced in Italy. Otherwise, it\n> gives a misleading indication which is not allowed under Italian law,\u201d Urso\n> said.\n>\n> [...]\n>\n> Urso\u2019s complaint is the latest in a war of words between Prime Minister\n> Giorgia Meloni\u2019s nationalist government and the Franco-Italian automaker, as\n> the two sides hold talks on a plan to boost domestic auto production to one\n> million units.\n>\n> The law mentioned by Urso says it is illegal to present a foreign-made\n> product as coming from Italy. Typically, it has been invoked against food\n> products, for example U.S.-made \u201cparmesan\u201d cheese resembling Italy\u2019s\n> \u201cparmigiano\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I first read about all this, I was super skeptical that this was an\nactual thing. Surely a country cannot ban this sort of situation, but\napparently, it is very true! There\u2019s even a Wikipedia page about it, and if\nit\u2019s on Wikipedia, it has to be real! Anyway, Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares\ndefended the choice to produce the Milano outside of Italy and explained why\nit was made in the first place. The CEO told Automotive News Europe that\nproducing the little crossover in Poland will cut about $10,700 from its final\nprice. That\u2019s a good enough reason to me, to be honest. Here\u2019s what Tavares\ntold the outlet:\n\n> \u201cIf built in Italy, a Milano would have started from about \u20ac40,000 instead\n> of \u20ac30,000, limiting its potential on the marketplace,\u201d Tavares said during\n> a roundtable discussion in Milan at the launch of the new model.\n>\n> So far, the Milano is the only Alfa Romeo model set for production outside\n> Italy. Tavares confirmed that the next-generation Stelvio midsize SUV, due\n> in 2025, and Giulia midsize sedan, due in 2026, will continue to be built in\n> Cassino, central Italy. Stellantis will invest more than \u20ac100 million there\n> to install European production for its new STLA Large platform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019ll be interesting to see how this all shakes out. To be honest, the messy\npart of me really hopes this all goes crazy for Stellantis and Italy, but I\nlike to keep things spicy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n", "frontpage": false}
