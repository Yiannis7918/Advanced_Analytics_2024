Foundation DNS is one of\nCloudflare's largest leaps forward in our authoritative DNS offering since its\nlaunch in 2010, and we know our customers are interested in an enterprise-\nready authoritative DNS service with the highest level of performance,\nreliability, security, flexibility, and advanced analytics.\n\nStarting today, every new enterprise contract that includes authoritative DNS\nwill have access to the Foundation DNS feature set and existing enterprise\ncustomers will have Foundation DNS features made available to them over the\ncourse of this year. If you are an existing enterprise customer already using\nour authoritative DNS services, and you\u2019re interested in getting your hands on\nFoundation DNS earlier, just reach out to your account team, and they can\nenable it for you. Let\u2019s get started...\n\n## Why is DNS so important?\n\nFrom an end user perspective, DNS makes the Internet usable. DNS is the phone\nbook of the Internet which translates hostnames like www.cloudflare.com into\nIP addresses that our browsers, applications, and devices use to connect to\nservices. Without DNS, users would have to remember IP addresses like\n108.162.193.147 or 2606:4700:58::adf5:3b93 every time they wanted to visit a\nwebsite on their mobile device or desktop \u2013 imagine having to remember\nsomething like that instead of just www.cloudflare.com. DNS is used in every\nend user application on the Internet, from social media to banking to\nhealthcare portals. People's usage of the Internet is entirely reliant on DNS.\n\nFrom a business perspective, DNS is the very first step in reaching websites\nand connecting to applications. Devices need to know where to connect in order\nto reach services, authenticate users, and provide the information being\nrequested. Resolving DNS queries quickly can be the difference between a\nwebsite or application being perceived as responsive or not and can have a\nreal impact on user experience.\n\nWhen DNS outages occur, the impacts are obvious. Imagine your go-to ecommerce\nsite not loading, just like what happened with the outage Dyn experienced in\n2016, which took down multiple popular ecommerce sites among others. Or, if\nyou are part of a company, and customers aren\u2019t able to reach your website to\npurchase the goods or services you are selling, a DNS outage will literally\nlose you money. DNS is often taken for granted, but make no mistake, you\u2019ll\nnotice it when it\u2019s not working properly. Thankfully, if you use Cloudflare\nauthoritative DNS, these are problems you don\u2019t worry about very much.\n\n## There is always room for improvement\n\nCloudflare has been providing authoritative DNS services for over a decade.\nOur authoritative DNS service hosts millions of domains across many different\ntop level domains (TLDs). We have customers of all sizes, from single domains\nwith just a few records to customers with tens of millions of records spread\nacross multiple domains. Our enterprise customers, rightfully, demand the\nhighest level of performance, reliability, security, and flexibility from our\nDNS service, along with detailed analytics. While our customers love our\nauthoritative DNS, we recognize there is always room for improvement in some\nof those categories. To that end, we set off to make some major improvements\nto our DNS architecture, with new features as well as structural changes. We\nare proudly calling this improved offering Foundation DNS.\n\n## Meet Foundation DNS\n\nAs our new enterprise authoritative DNS offering, Foundation DNS was designed\nto enhance the reliability, security, flexibility, and analytics of our\nexisting authoritative DNS service. Before we dive into all the specifics of\nFoundation DNS, here is a quick summary of what Foundation DNS brings to our\nauthoritative DNS offering:\n\n  * Advanced nameservers bring DNS reliability to the next level.\n  * New zone-level DNS settings provide more flexible configuration of DNS specific settings.\n  * Unique DNSSEC keys per account and zone provide additional security and flexibility for DNSSEC.\n  * GraphQL-based DNS analytics provide even more insights into your DNS queries.\n  * A new release process ensures enterprise customers have the utmost stability and reliability.\n  * Simpler DNS pricing with more generous quotas for DNS-only zones and DNS records.\n\nNow, let\u2019s dive deeper into each of these new Foundation DNS features:\n\n### Advanced nameservers\n\nWith Foundation DNS, we\u2019re introducing advanced nameservers with a specific\nfocus on enhancing reliability for your enterprise. You might be familiar with\nour standard authoritative nameservers which come as a pair per zone and use\nnames within the cloudflare.com domain. Here\u2019s an example:\n\n    \n    \n    $ dig mycoolwebpage.xyz ns +noall +answer mycoolwebpage.xyz. 86400 IN NS kelly.ns.cloudflare.com. mycoolwebpage.xyz. 86400 IN NS christian.ns.cloudflare.com.\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at the same zone using Foundation DNS advanced nameservers:\n\n    \n    \n    $ dig mycoolwebpage.xyz ns +noall +answer mycoolwebpage.xyz. 86400 IN NS blue.foundationdns.com. mycoolwebpage.xyz. 86400 IN NS blue.foundationdns.net. mycoolwebpage.xyz. 86400 IN NS blue.foundationdns.org.\n\nAdvanced nameservers improve reliability in a few different ways. The first\nimprovement comes from the Foundation DNS authoritative servers being spread\nacross multiple TLDs. This provides protection from larger scale DNS outages\nand DDoS attacks that could potentially affect DNS infrastructure further up\nthe tree, including TLD name servers. Foundation DNS authoritative nameservers\nare now located across multiple branches of the global DNS tree structure,\nfurther insulating our customers from these potential outages and attacks.\n\nYou might also have noticed that there is an additional nameserver listed with\nFoundation DNS. While this is an improvement, it's not for the reason you\nmight think it is. If we resolve each one of these nameservers to their\nrespective IP addresses, we can make this a little easier to understand. Let\u2019s\ndo that here starting with our standard nameservers:\n\n    \n    \n    $ dig kelly.ns.cloudflare.com. +noall +answer kelly.ns.cloudflare.com. 86353 IN A 108.162.194.91 kelly.ns.cloudflare.com. 86353 IN A 162.159.38.91 kelly.ns.cloudflare.com. 86353 IN A 172.64.34.91 $ dig christian.ns.cloudflare.com. +noall +answer christian.ns.cloudflare.com. 86353 IN A 108.162.195.247 christian.ns.cloudflare.com. 86353 IN A 162.159.44.247 christian.ns.cloudflare.com. 86353 IN A 172.64.35.247\n\nThere are six total IP addresses for the two nameservers. As it turns out,\nthis is all DNS resolvers actually care about when querying authoritative\nnameservers. DNS resolvers usually don\u2019t track the actual domain names of\nauthoritative servers; they simply maintain an unordered list of IP addresses\nthat they can use to resolve queries for a given domain. So with our standard\nauthoritative nameservers, we give resolvers six IP addresses to use to\nresolve DNS queries. Now, let's look at the IP addresses for our Foundation\nDNS advanced nameservers:\n\n    \n    \n    $ dig blue.foundationdns.com. +noall +answer blue.foundationdns.com. 300 IN A 108.162.198.1 blue.foundationdns.com. 300 IN A 162.159.60.1 blue.foundationdns.com. 300 IN A 172.64.40.1 $ dig blue.foundationdns.net. +noall +answer blue.foundationdns.net. 300 IN A 108.162.198.1 blue.foundationdns.net. 300 IN A 162.159.60.1 blue.foundationdns.net. 300 IN A 172.64.40.1 $ dig blue.foundationdns.org. +noall +answer blue.foundationdns.org. 300 IN A 108.162.198.1 blue.foundationdns.org. 300 IN A 162.159.60.1 blue.foundationdns.org. 300 IN A 172.64.40.1\n\nWould you look at that! Foundation DNS provides the same IP addresses for each\nof the authoritative nameservers that we provide to a zone. So in this case,\nwe have only provided three IP addresses for resolvers to use to resolve DNS\nqueries. And you might be wondering,\u201cisn\u2019t six better than three? Isn\u2019t this a\ndowngrade?\u201d It turns out more isn\u2019t always better. Let\u2019s talk about why.\n\nYou are probably aware of Cloudflare\u2019s use of Anycast and, as you might\nassume, our DNS services leverage Anycast to ensure that our authoritative DNS\nservers are available globally and as close as possible to users and resolvers\nacross the Internet. Our standard nameservers are all advertised out of every\nCloudflare data center by a single Anycast group. If we zoom in on Europe, you\ncan see that in a standard nameserver deployment, both nameservers are\nadvertised from every data center.\n\nWe can take those six IP addresses from our standard nameservers above and\nperform a lookup for their \"hostname.bind\" TXT record which will show us the\nairport code or physical location of the closest data center where our DNS\nqueries are being resolved from. This output helps explain the reason why more\nisn\u2019t always better.\n\n    \n    \n    $ dig @108.162.194.91 ch txt hostname.bind +short \"LHR\" $ dig @162.159.38.91 ch txt hostname.bind +short \"LHR\" $ dig @172.64.34.91 ch txt hostname.bind +short \"LHR\" $ dig @108.162.195.247 ch txt hostname.bind +short \"LHR\" $ dig @162.159.44.247 ch txt hostname.bind +short \"LHR\" $ dig @172.64.35.247 ch txt hostname.bind +short \"LHR\"\n\nAs you can see, when queried from near London, all six of those IP addresses\nroute to the same London (LHR) data center. Meaning that when a resolver in\nLondon is resolving DNS queries for a domain using Cloudflare\u2019s standard\nauthoritative DNS, no matter which nameserver IP address is being queried,\nthey are always connecting to the same physical location.\n\nYou might be asking, \u201cSo what? What does that mean to me?\u201d Let\u2019s look at an\nexample. If you wanted to resolve a domain using Cloudflare standard\nnameservers from London, and I am using a public resolver that is also located\nin London, the resolver will always connect to the Cloudflare LHR data center\nregardless of which nameserver it's trying to reach. It doesn\u2019t have any other\noption, because of Anycast.\n\nBecause of Anycast, should the LHR data center go offline completely, all the\ntraffic intended for LHR would be routed to other nearby data centers and\nresolvers would continue to function normally. However, in the unlikely\nscenario where the LHR data center was online, but our DNS services aren\u2019t\nable to respond to DNS queries, the resolver would have no way to resolve\nthese DNS queries since they can\u2019t reach out to any other data center. We\ncould have 100 IP addresses, and it would not help us in this scenario.\nEventually, cached responses will expire, and the domain will eventually stop\nbeing resolved.\n\nFoundation DNS advanced nameservers are changing the way we use Anycast by\nleveraging two Anycast groups, which breaks the previous paradigm of every\nauthoritative nameserver IP being advertised from every data center. Using two\nAnycast groups means that Foundation DNS authoritative nameservers actually\nhave different physical locations from one another, rather than all being\nadvertised from each data center. Here is how that same region would look\nusing two Anycast groups:\n\nLet\u2019s go back and finish our comparison of six authoritative IP addresses for\nstandard authoritative DNS vs three IP addresses for Foundation DNS now that\nit's understood that Foundation DNS is using two Anycast groups for\nadvertising nameservers. Let\u2019s see where Foundation DNS servers are being\nadvertised from for our example:\n\n    \n    \n    $ dig @108.162.198.1 ch txt hostname.bind +short \"LHR\" $ dig @162.159.60.1 ch txt hostname.bind +short \"LHR\" $ dig @172.64.40.1 ch txt hostname.bind +short \"MAN\"\n\nLook at that! One of our three nameserver IP addresses is being advertised out\nof a different data center, Manchester (MAN), making Foundation DNS more\nreliable and resilient for the previously mentioned outage scenario. It's\nworth mentioning that in some cities, Cloudflare operates out of multiple data\ncenters which will result in all three queries returning the same airport\ncode. While we guarantee that at least one of those IP addresses is being\nadvertised out of a different data center, we understand some customers may\nwant to test for themselves. In those cases, an additional query can show that\nIP addresses are being advertised out of different data centers.\n\n    \n    \n    $ dig @108.162.198.1 +nsid | grep NSID: ; NSID: 39 34 6d 33 39 (\"94m39\")\n\nIn the \"94m30\" returned in the response, the number before the \"m\" represents\nthe data center that answered the query. As long as that number is different\nin one of the three responses, you know that one of your Foundation DNS\nauthoritative nameservers is being advertised out of a different physical\nlocation.\n\nWith Foundation DNS leveraging two Anycast groups, the previous outage\nscenario is handled seamlessly. DNS resolvers monitor requests to all the\nauthoritative nameservers returned for a given domain, but primarily use the\nnameserver that is providing the fastest responses.\n\nWith this configuration, DNS resolvers are able to send requests to two\ndifferent Cloudflare data centers, so, should a failure happen at one physical\nlocation, queries are then automatically sent to the second data center where\nthey can be properly resolved.\n\nFoundation DNS advanced nameservers are a big step forward in reliability for\nour enterprise customers. We welcome our enterprise customers to enable\nadvanced nameservers for existing zones today. Migrating to Foundation DNS\nwon\u2019t involve any downtime either because even after Foundation DNS advanced\nnameservers are enabled for a zone, the previous standard authoritative DNS\nnameservers will continue to function and respond to queries for the zone.\nCustomers don\u2019t need to plan for a cutover or other service-impacting event to\nmigrate to Foundation DNS advanced nameservers.\n\n### New zone-level DNS settings\n\nHistorically, we have received regular requests from our enterprise customers\nto adjust specific DNS settings that were not exposed via our API or\ndashboard, such as enabling secondary DNS overrides. When customers wanted\nthese settings adjusted, they had to reach out to their account teams, who\nwould change the configurations. With Foundation DNS, we are exposing the most\ncommonly requested settings via the API and dashboard to give our customers\nincreased flexibility with their Cloudflare authoritative DNS solution.\n\nEnterprise customers can now configure the following DNS settings on their\nzones:\n\nSetting| Zone Type| Description  \n---|---|---  \nFoundation DNS advanced nameservers| Primary and secondary zones| Allows you\nto enable advanced nameservers on your zone.  \nSecondary DNS override| Secondary zones| Allows you to enable Secondary DNS\nOverride on your zone in order to proxy HTTP/S traffic through Cloudflare.  \nMulti-provider DNS| Primary and secondary zones| Allows you to have multiple\nauthoritative DNS providers while using Cloudflare as a primary nameserver.  \n  \n### Unique DNSSEC keys per account and zone\n\nDNSSEC, which stands for Domain Name System Security Extensions, adds security\nto a domain or zone by providing a way to check that the response you receive\nfor a DNS query is authentic and hasn't been modified. DNSSEC prevents DNS\ncache poisoning (DNS spoofing) which helps ensure that DNS resolvers are\nresponding to DNS queries with the correct IP addresses.\n\nSince we launched Universal DNSSEC in 2015, we\u2019ve made quite a few\nimprovements, like adding support for pre-signed DNSSEC for secondary zones\nand multi-signer DNSSEC. By default, Cloudflare signs DNS records on the fly\n(live signing) as we respond to DNS queries. This allows Cloudflare to host a\nDNSSEC-secured domain while dynamically allocating IP addresses for the\nproxied origins. It also enables certain load balancing use cases since the IP\naddresses served in the DNS response in these cases change based on steering.\n\nCloudflare uses the Elliptic Curve algorithm ECDSA P-256, which is stronger\nthan most RSA keys used today. It uses less CPU to generate signatures, making\nthem more efficient to generate on the fly. Usually two keys are used as part\nof DNSSEC, the Zone Signing Key (ZSK) and the Key Signing Key (KSK). At the\nsimplest level, the ZSK is used for signing the DNS records that are served in\nresponse to queries and the KSK is used to sign the DNSKEYs, including the ZSK\nto ensure its authenticity.\n\nToday, Cloudflare uses a shared ZSK and KSK globally for all DNSSEC signing,\nand since we use such a strong cryptographic algorithm, we know how secure\nthis key set is and as such, do not believe there is a need to regularly\nrotate the ZSK or KSK \u2013 at least for security reasons. There are customers,\nhowever, that have policies that require the rotation of these keys at certain\nintervals. Because of this, we\u2019ve added the ability for our new Foundation DNS\nadvanced nameservers to rotate both their ZSK and KSK as needed per account or\nper zone. This will first be available via the API and subsequently through\nthe Cloudflare dashboard. So now, customers with strict policy requirements\naround their DNSSEC key rotation can meet those requirements with Cloudflare\nFoundation DNS.\n\n### GraphQL-based DNS analytics\n\nFor those who are not familiar with it, GraphQL is a query language for APIs\nand a runtime for executing those queries. It allows clients to request\nexactly what they need, no more, no less, enabling them to aggregate data from\nmultiple sources through a single API call, and supports real-time updates\nthrough subscriptions.\n\nAs you might know, Cloudflare has had a GraphQL API for a while now, but as\npart of Foundation DNS we are adding a new DNS dataset to that API that is\nonly available with our new Foundation DNS advanced nameservers.\n\nThe new DNS dataset in our GraphQL API can be used to fetch information about\nthe DNS queries a zone has received. This faster and more powerful alternative\nto our current DNS Analytics API allows you to query data from large time\nperiods quickly and efficiently without running into limits or timeouts. The\nGraphQL API is more flexible with regard to which queries it accepts, and\nexposes more information than the DNS Analytics API.\n\nFor example, you can run this query to fetch the mean and 90th percentile\nprocessing time of your queries, grouped by source IP address, in 15 minute\nbuckets. A query like this would be useful to see which IPs are querying your\nrecords most often for a given time range:\n\n    \n    \n    { \"query\": \"{ viewer { zones(filter: { zoneTag: $zoneTag }) { dnsAnalyticsAdaptiveGroups( filter: $filter limit: 10 orderBy: [datetime_ASC] ) { avg { processingTimeUs } quantiles { processingTimeUsP90 } dimensions { datetimeFifteenMinutes sourceIP } } } } }\", \"variables\": { \"zoneTag\": \"<zone-tag>\", \"filter\": { \"datetime_geq\": \"2024-05-01T00:00:00Z\", \"datetime_leq\": \"2024-06-01T00:00:00Z\" } } }\n\nPreviously, a query like this wouldn\u2019t have been possible for several reasons.\nThe first is that we have added new fields like sourceIP, which allows us to\nfilter data based on which client IP addresses (usually resolvers) are making\nDNS queries. The second is that the GraphQL API query is able to process and\nreturn data from much larger time ranges. A DNS zone with sufficiently large\namounts of queries was previously only able to query across a few days of\ntraffic, while the new GraphQL API can provide data for a period of up to 31\ndays. We are planning further enhancements to that range, as well as how far\nback historical data can be stored and queried.\n\nThe GraphQL API also allows us to add a new DNS analytics section to the\nCloudflare dashboard. Customers will be able to track the most queried\nrecords, see which data centers are answering those queries, see how many\nqueries are being made, and much more.\n\nThe new DNS dataset in our GraphQL API and the new DNS analytics page work\ntogether to help our DNS customers to monitor, analyze, and troubleshoot their\nFoundation DNS deployments.\n\n### New release process\n\nCloudflare\u2019s Authoritative DNS product receives software updates roughly once\na week. Cloudflare has a sophisticated release process that helps prevent\nregressions from affecting production traffic. While uncommon, it's possible\nto have issues only surface once the new release is subject to the volume and\nuniqueness of production traffic.\n\nBecause our enterprise customers desire stability even more than new features,\nnew releases will be subject to a two-week soak time with our standard\nnameservers before our Foundation DNS advanced nameservers are upgraded. After\ntwo weeks with no issues, the Foundation DNS advanced nameservers will be\nupgraded as well.\n\nZones using Foundation DNS advanced nameservers will see increased reliability\nas they are better protected against regressions in new software releases.\n\n### Simpler DNS pricing\n\nHistorically, Cloudflare has charged for authoritative DNS based on monthly\nDNS queries and the number of domains in the account. Our enterprise DNS\ncustomers are often interested in DNS-only zones, which are DNS zones hosted\nin Cloudflare that do not use our reverse proxy (layer 7) services such as our\nCDN, WAF, or Bot Management. With Foundation DNS, we\u2019re making pricing simpler\nfor the vast majority of those customers by including 10,000 DNS only domains\nby default. This change means most customers will only pay for the number of\nDNS queries they consume.\n\nWe\u2019re also including 1 million DNS records across all domains in an account.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t support more. In fact, the biggest single zone\non our platform has over 3.9 million records, while our largest DNS account is\njust shy of 30 million DNS records spread across multiple zones. With\nCloudflare DNS, there is no trouble handling even the largest deployments.\n\n## There is more to come\n\nWe are just getting started. In the future, we will add more exclusive\nfeatures to Foundation DNS. One example is a highly requested feature: per-\nrecord scoped API tokens and user permissions. This will allow you to\nconfigure permissions on an even more granular level. For example, you could\nspecify that a particular member of your account is only allowed to create and\nmanage records of the type TXT and MX, so they don\u2019t accidentally delete or\nedit address records impacting web traffic to your domain. Another example\nwould be to specify permissions based on subdomain to further restrict the\nscope of specific users.\n\nIf you\u2019re an existing enterprise customer and want to use Foundation DNS, get\nin touch with your account team to provision Foundation DNS on your account.\n\nWe protect entire corporate networks, help customers build Internet-scale\napplications efficiently, accelerate any website or Internet application, ward\noff DDoS attacks, keep hackers at bay, and can help you on your journey to\nZero Trust.\n\nVisit 1.1.1.1 from any device to get started with our free app that makes your\nInternet faster and safer.\n\nTo learn more about our mission to help build a better Internet, start here.\nIf you're looking for a new career direction, check out our open positions.\n\nDiscuss on Hacker News\n\nDNSFoundation DNSProduct News\n\nFollow on X\n\nCloudflare|@cloudflare\n\nRelated posts\n\nMarch 07, 2024 2:00 PM\n\n## Advanced DNS Protection: mitigating sophisticated DNS DDoS attacks\n\nWe're proud to introduce the Advanced DNS Protection system, a robust defense\nmechanism designed to protect against the most sophisticated DNS-based DDoS\nattacks...\n\nBy\n\n  * Omer Yoachimik,\n\n  * Cody Doucette\n\nSecurity Week, DNS, Advanced DDoS, Network Protection\n\nFebruary 29, 2024 2:00 PM\n\n## Remediating new DNSSEC resource exhaustion vulnerabilities\n\nCloudflare recently fixed two critical DNSSEC vulnerabilities: CVE-2023-50387\nand CVE-2023-50868.
