According to Cognition, Devin can perform\nall these tasks unassisted: build a website from scratch and deploy it, find\nand fix bugs in codebases, and even train and fine-tune its own large language\nmodel.\n\nFollowing its launch, open-source alternatives to Devin have cropped up,\nincluding Devika and OpenDevin. Meanwhile makers of established assistants\nhave not been standing still. Researchers at Microsoft, GitHub Copilot\u2019s\ndeveloper, recently uploaded a paper to the arXiv preprint server introducing\nAutoDev, which uses autonomous AI agents to generate code and test cases, run\ntests and check the results, and fix bugs within the test cases.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting to see more versions of AI coding assistants with new\ncapabilities,\u201d says Ben Dechrai, a coder and developer advocate at software\ncompany Sonar. \u201cThey validate the need for generative AI tools in developers\u2019\nworkflows.\u201d\n\nDechrai adds that these coding copilots can help software engineers write code\nfaster, allowing them to focus on more strategic and creative tasks. Another\nadvantage of these programming tools is the ability to create a template for\ncode, notes Saurabh Bagchi, a professor of electrical and computer engineering\nat Purdue University. Much as with prompt engineering, developers must provide\nthese assistants with \u201cthe right kind of software requirements to produce a\ntemplate, and then a software engineer can fill in the gaps,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cTo develop intuitive systems, you need an iterative process with humans in\nthe loop to provide feedback\u201d \u2014Saurabh Bagchi, Purdue University\n\nThese gaps include safety and reliability considerations. Software engineers\nmust look out for security vulnerabilities in AI-generated code, as well as\nthe types of corner cases that could cause it to crash.\n\n\u201cDevelopers still need to ensure rigorous quality standards are in place when\nanalyzing and reviewing code written with generative AI, just as they would\nwith code developed by a human,\u201d says Dechrai. \u201cAI coding assistants are good\nat suggesting code, reflecting on the code, and reasoning about its\neffectiveness, but even then it\u2019s not 100 percent accurate.\u201d\n\nDechrai cautions that autonomous coders are \u201cstill so new that developers are\njust learning which use cases will be most beneficial.\u201d And they\u2019ll need to be\n\u201cironed out in the real world to see how much they\u2019re able to deliver on their\npromise,\u201d says Bagchi.\n\n## AI Coders vs. the Humans\n\nDoom-and-gloom predictions of replacing human software engineers are also\nbound to follow the emergence of these \u201cAI software engineers,\u201d but that won\u2019t\nbe happening anytime soon. Devin, for instance, resolved only 14 percent of a\nsubset of GitHub issues from real-world code repositories. \u201cThere\u2019s still a\nlong way to go for it to become something I can rely on blindfolded,\u201d says\nBagchi.\n\nHe notes that these autonomous programming tools have another blind spot: the\nfact that software development happens in collaboration. Coding copilots try\nto do everything, and they might do it reasonably well. On the other hand,\ndifferent software engineers have their own specialties\u2014be it front end, back\nend, full stack, or data, to name a few\u2014and they all work together to build a\ncohesive product.\n\n\u201cTo develop intuitive systems, you need an iterative process with humans in\nthe loop to provide feedback,\u201d Bagchi says. \u201cThe fundamental human intuition,\ndepth, and imagination has to be brought to bear.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why Bagchi believes these unassisted versions won\u2019t be dominating the\nspace that coding assistants hold\u2014at least for now. \u201cThe models running\nunderneath are similar in architecture, and as technology continues to evolve,\nboth of them will get better,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the Copilot or CodeWhisperer\nmodel seems most promising and is better suited to complex software\ndevelopment where humans work with the assistance of AI.\u201d\n\nYet programmers \u201cshould start using these tools if they haven\u2019t already, or\nthey\u2019ll risk getting left behind,\u201d says Dechrai. \u201cIf you want to know if an AI\ncoding assistant is truly beneficial, you have to use it yourself, get to know\nit, and see where it fails.\u201d\n\nBagchi echoes the sentiment: \u201cTry them out with the use cases you have and\nstress them with the kinds of software you\u2019re creating.\u201d But because\nunassisted coding copilots are a nascent technology, they are likely to\nimprove rapidly. \u201cSo you have to track them,\u201d he adds.\n\nMoreover, software engineers will have to \u201cconsistently ensure code is secure,\nreliable, and maintainable throughout its life cycle,\u201d Dechrai says. \u201cIt will\nalways be up to the developer to properly understand the output and how it was\ngenerated.\u201d\n\nFrom Your Site Articles\n\n  * How Coders Can Survive\u2014and Thrive\u2014in a ChatGPT World \u203a\n  * Ownership of AI-Generated Code Hotly Disputed \u203a\n\ngithubai generated softwareartificial intelligencecodinggenerative\naiprogrammingsoftware developmentsoftware engineering\n\nRina Diane Caballar\n\nRina Diane Caballar is a journalist and former software engineer based in\nWellington, New Zealand.\n\nThe Conversation (1)\n\nSort by\n\nAugusto Silva de Paula12 Apr, 2024\n\nAM\n\nIncorporating A.I. assistants in our workflow should be encouraged from our\nemployers but the general feeling still is that of loosing control over\ncorporate data and IP\n\ncopied to clipboard\n\n0 RepliesHide replies\n\nShow More Replies\n\nEnergyAerospaceInterview\n\n## Caltech\u2019s SSPD-1 Is a New Idea for Space-Based Solar\n\n14 hours ago\n\n6 min read\n\nRoboticsArtificial IntelligenceInterview\n\n## Marco Hutter Wants to Solve Robotics\u2019 Hard Problems\n\n17 hours ago\n\n5 min read\n\nAerospaceRoboticsGuest ArticleConsumer ElectronicsDIYTelecommunications\n\n## Ukraine Is the First \u201cHackers\u2019 War\u201d\n\n10 Apr 2024\n\n8 min read\n\n1\n\n## Related Stories\n\nSemiconductorsArtificial IntelligenceNewsComputing\n\n## Intel\u2019s Gaudi 3 Goes After Nvidia\n\nClimate TechOpinionClimate ChangeComputing\n\n## Software Sucks, but It Doesn\u2019t Have To\n\nAerospaceArtificial IntelligenceNews\n\n## AI Generates 3D City Maps From Single Radar Images\n\n", "frontpage": false}
