But\nas the effects of climate change bleach and break down coral reefs around the\nworld, and extreme weather events become more common, coastal communities are\nleft increasingly vulnerable to frequent flooding and erosion.\n\nAn MIT team is now hoping to fortify coastlines with \u201carchitected\u201d reefs \u2014\nsustainable, offshore structures engineered to mimic the wave-buffering\neffects of natural reefs while also providing pockets for fish and other\nmarine life.\n\nThe team\u2019s reef design centers on a cylindrical structure surrounded by four\nrudder-like slats. The engineers found that when this structure stands up\nagainst a wave, it efficiently breaks the wave into turbulent jets that\nultimately dissipate most of the wave\u2019s total energy. The team has calculated\nthat the new design could reduce as much wave energy as existing artificial\nreefs, using 10 times less material.\n\nThe researchers plan to fabricate each cylindrical structure from sustainable\ncement, which they would mold in a pattern of \u201cvoxels\u201d that could be\nautomatically assembled, and would provide pockets for fish to explore and\nother marine life to settle in. The cylinders could be connected to form a\nlong, semipermeable wall, which the engineers could erect along a coastline,\nabout half a mile from shore. Based on the team\u2019s initial experiments with\nlab-scale prototypes, the architected reef could reduce the energy of incoming\nwaves by more than 95 percent.\n\n\u201cThis would be like a long wave-breaker,\u201d says Michael Triantafyllou, the\nHenry L. and Grace Doherty Professor in Ocean Science and Engineering in the\nDepartment of Mechanical Engineering. \u201cIf waves are 6 meters high coming\ntoward this reef structure, they would be ultimately less than a meter high on\nthe other side. So, this kills the impact of the waves, which could prevent\nerosion and flooding.\u201d\n\nDetails of the architected reef design are reported today in a study appearing\nin the open-access journal PNAS Nexus. Triantafyllou\u2019s MIT co-authors are\nEdvard Ronglan SM \u201923; graduate students Alfonso Parra Rubio, Jose del Aguila\nFerrandis, and Erik Strand; research scientists Patricia Maria Stathatou and\nCarolina Bastidas; and Professor Neil Gershenfeld, director of the Center for\nBits and Atoms; along with Alexis Oliveira Da Silva at the Polytechnic\nInstitute of Paris, Dixia Fan of Westlake University, and Jeffrey Gair Jr. of\nScinetics, Inc.\n\nLeveraging turbulence\n\nSome regions have already erected artificial reefs to protect their coastlines\nfrom encroaching storms. These structures are typically sunken ships, retired\noil and gas platforms, and even assembled configurations of concrete, metal,\ntires, and stones. However, there\u2019s variability in the types of artificial\nreefs that are currently in place, and no standard for engineering such\nstructures. What\u2019s more, the designs that are deployed tend to have a low wave\ndissipation per unit volume of material used. That is, it takes a huge amount\nof material to break enough wave energy to adequately protect coastal\ncommunities.\n\nThe MIT team instead looked for ways to engineer an artificial reef that would\nefficiently dissipate wave energy with less material, while also providing a\nrefuge for fish living along any vulnerable coast.\n\n\u201cRemember, natural coral reefs are only found in tropical waters,\u201d says\nTriantafyllou, who is director of the MIT Sea Grant. \u201cWe cannot have these\nreefs, for instance, in Massachusetts. But architected reefs don\u2019t depend on\ntemperature, so they can be placed in any water, to protect more coastal\nareas.\u201d\n\nMIT researchers test the wave-breaking performance of two artificial reef\nstructures in the MIT Towing Tank.\n\nCredit: Courtesy of the researchers\n\nThe new effort is the result of a collaboration between researchers in MIT Sea\nGrant, who developed the reef structure\u2019s hydrodynamic design, and researchers\nat the Center for Bits and Atoms (CBA), who worked to make the structure\nmodular and easy to fabricate on location. The team\u2019s architected reef design\ngrew out of two seemingly unrelated problems. CBA researchers were developing\nultralight cellular structures for the aerospace industry, while Sea Grant\nresearchers were assessing the performance of blowout preventers in offshore\noil structures \u2014 cylindrical valves that are used to seal off oil and gas\nwells and prevent them from leaking.\n\nThe team\u2019s tests showed that the structure\u2019s cylindrical arrangement generated\na high amount of drag. In other words, the structure appeared to be especially\nefficient in dissipating high-force flows of oil and gas. They wondered: Could\nthe same arrangement dissipate another type of flow, in ocean waves?\n\nThe researchers began to play with the general structure in simulations of\nwater flow, tweaking its dimensions and adding certain elements to see whether\nand how waves changed as they crashed against each simulated design. This\niterative process ultimately landed on an optimized geometry: a vertical\ncylinder flanked by four long slats, each attached to the cylinder in a way\nthat leaves space for water to flow through the resulting structure. They\nfound this setup essentially breaks up any incoming wave energy, causing parts\nof the wave-induced flow to spiral to the sides rather than crashing ahead.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re leveraging this turbulence and these powerful jets to ultimately\ndissipate wave energy,\u201d Ferrandis says.\n\nStanding up to storms\n\nOnce the researchers identified an optimal wave-dissipating structure, they\nfabricated a laboratory-scale version of an architected reef made from a\nseries of the cylindrical structures, which they 3D-printed from plastic. Each\ntest cylinder measured about 1 foot wide and 4 feet tall. They assembled a\nnumber of cylinders, each spaced about a foot apart, to form a fence-like\nstructure, which they then lowered into a wave tank at MIT. They then\ngenerated waves of various heights and measured them before and after passing\nthrough the architected reef.\n\n\u201cWe saw the waves reduce substantially, as the reef destroyed their energy,\u201d\nTriantafyllou says.\n\nThe team has also looked into making the structures more porous, and friendly\nto fish. They found that, rather than making each structure from a solid slab\nof plastic, they could use a more affordable and sustainable type of cement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve worked with biologists to test the cement we intend to use, and it\u2019s\nbenign to fish, and ready to go,\u201d he adds.\n\nThey identified an ideal pattern of \u201cvoxels,\u201d or microstructures, that cement\ncould be molded into, in order to fabricate the reefs while creating pockets\nin which fish could live. This voxel geometry resembles individual egg\ncartons, stacked end to end, and appears to not affect the structure\u2019s overall\nwave-dissipating power.\n\n\u201cThese voxels still maintain a big drag while allowing fish to move inside,\u201d\nFerrandis says.\n\nThe team is currently fabricating cement voxel structures and assembling them\ninto a lab-scale architected reef, which they will test under various wave\nconditions. They envision that the voxel design could be modular, and scalable\nto any desired size, and easy to transport and install in various offshore\nlocations. \u201cNow we\u2019re simulating actual sea patterns, and testing how these\nmodels will perform when we eventually have to deploy them,\u201d says Anjali\nSinha, a graduate student at MIT who recently joined the group.\n\nGoing forward, the team hopes to work with beach towns in Massachusetts to\ntest the structures on a pilot scale.\n\n\u201cThese test structures would not be small,\u201d Triantafyllou emphasizes. \u201cThey\nwould be about a mile long, and about 5 meters tall, and would cost something\nlike 6 million dollars per mile. So it\u2019s not cheap. But it could prevent\nbillions of dollars in storm damage. And with climate change, protecting the\ncoasts will become a big issue.\u201d\n\nThis work was funded, in part, by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects\nAgency.\n\n### Share this news article on:\n\n  * X\n  * Facebook\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Reddit\n  * Print\n\n## Paper\n\nPaper: \u201cArchitected materials for artificial reefs to increase storm energy\ndissipation\u201d\n\n## Related Links\n\n  * Michael Triantafyllou\n  * Neil Gershenfeld\n  * MIT Sea Grant\n  * Center for Bits and Atoms\n  * Department of Mechanical Engineering\n  * School of Engineering\n\n## Related Topics\n\n  * Climate change\n  * Disaster response\n  * Environment\n  * Fluid dynamics\n  * Mechanical engineering\n  * Ocean science\n  * Oceanography and ocean engineering\n  * Physics\n  * Sustainability\n  * Water\n  * Weather\n  * Research\n  * School of Engineering\n  * Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)\n\n## Related Articles\n\n### Engineers devise a modular system to produce efficient, scalable aquabots\n\n### Intelligent Towing Tank propels human-robot-computer research\n\n### Scientists discover slimy microbes that may help keep coral reefs healthy\n\n### 3 Questions: Harnessing wave power to rebuild islands\n\n### Exploring New England's coastal ecosystems in the dead of winter\n\n## More MIT News\n\n### A biomedical engineer pivots from human movement to women\u2019s health\n\nPostdoc Shaniel Bowen studies women's sexual anatomy and health while also\nworking to interest young women in STEM careers.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n### MIT tops among single-campus universities in US patents granted\n\nFor 10th consecutive year, the Institute ranks No. 2 among all colleges and\nNo. 1 among colleges with one main campus, underlying the impact of innovation\nand critical role of technology transfer.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n### A new way to detect radiation involving cheap ceramics\n\nWork by MIT engineers could lead to plethora of new applications, including\nbetter detectors for nuclear materials at ports.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n### A crossroads for computing at MIT\n\nThe MIT Schwarzman College of Computing building will form a new cluster of\nconnectivity across a spectrum of disciplines in computing and artificial\nintelligence.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n### Growing our donated organ supply\n\nGraduate student Hammaad Adam is working to increase the supply of organs\navailable for transplants, saving lives and improving health equity.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n### New AI method captures uncertainty in medical images\n\nBy providing plausible label maps for one medical image, the Tyche machine-\nlearning model could help clinicians and researchers capture crucial\ninformation.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n  * More news on MIT News homepage \u2192\n\n## More about MIT News at Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nThis website is managed by the MIT News Office, part of the Institute Office\nof Communications.\n\n### News by Schools/College:\n\n  * School of Architecture and Planning\n  * School of Engineering\n  * School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences\n  * MIT Sloan School of Management\n  * School of Science\n  * MIT Schwarzman College of Computing\n\n### Resources:\n\n  * About the MIT News Office\n  * MIT News Press Center\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Press Inquiries\n  * Filming Guidelines\n  * RSS Feeds\n\n### Tools:\n\n  * Subscribe to MIT Daily/Weekly\n  * Subscribe to press releases\n  * Submit campus news\n  * Guidelines for campus news contributors\n  * Guidelines on generative AI\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA,\nUSA\n\nRecommended Links:\n\n  * Visit\n  * Map (opens in new window)\n  * Events (opens in new window)\n  * People (opens in new window)\n  * Careers (opens in new window)\n  * Contact\n  * Privacy\n  * Accessibility\n  *     * Social Media Hub\n    * MIT on X\n    * MIT on Facebook\n    * MIT on YouTube\n    * MIT on Instagram\n\n", "frontpage": false}
