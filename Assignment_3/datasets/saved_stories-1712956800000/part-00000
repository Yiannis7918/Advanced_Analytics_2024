Bestsvetnaya koka-kola, lit.\n\"colorless Coca-Cola\") was a clear variant of Coca-Cola produced in the 1940s\nat the request of Marshal of the Soviet Union Georgy Zhukov. Like other clear\ncolas, it had the same flavor as the original, virtually unchanged by the\nabsence of caramel coloring.\n\n## History[edit]\n\nMarshal Zhukov (shown here with a General's insignia) reportedly requested the\nmanufacture of a colorless, unlabeled variant of Coca-Cola, known later as\n\"White Coke\"\n\nZhukov was introduced to Coca-Cola during, or shortly after, World War II by\nhis counterpart in Western Europe, Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was also a fan of\nthe drink.^[2] As Coca-Cola was regarded in the Soviet Union as a symbol of\nAmerican imperialism,^[3] Zhukov was apparently reluctant to be photographed\nwith or reported as consuming such a product. According to journalist Tom\nStandage, without corroborating sources, Zhukov later asked whether Coca-Cola\ncould be manufactured and packaged to resemble vodka.^[1]^[4]\n\nMarshal Zhukov reportedly made this inquiry through General Mark W. Clark,\ncommander of the US sector of Allied-occupied Austria, who passed the request\non to US President Harry S. Truman. The President's staff contacted James\nFarley, chairman of the Board of the Coca-Cola Export Corporation. At the\ntime, Farley was overseeing the establishment of 38 Coca-Cola plants in\nSoutheast Europe, including Austria. Farley delegated Zhukov's special order\nto Mladin Zarubica, a technical supervisor for the Coca-Cola Company.^[5] He\nhad been sent to Austria in 1946 to supervise establishment of a large\nbottling plant. Zarubica found a chemist who could remove the coloring from\nCoca-Cola.\n\nThe colorless version of Coca-Cola was bottled using straight, clear glass\nbottles with a white cap and a red star in the middle.^[6]^[7] The bottle and\nthe cap were produced by the Crown Cork and Seal Company in Brussels.^[1] The\nfirst shipment of White Coke consisted of 50 cases.^[3]^[8]\n\nOne unusual consequence for the Coca-Cola Company was a relaxation of the\nregulations imposed by the occupying powers in Austria at the time. Coca-Cola\nsupplies and products were required to transit a Soviet occupation zone while\nbeing transported between the Lambach bottling plant and the Vienna warehouse.\nWhile all goods entering the Soviet zone normally took weeks to be cleared by\nauthorities, Coca-Cola shipments were never stopped.^[8]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Coca-Cola Clear\n  * Crystal Pepsi\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c ^d O'Callaghan, Tommy (21 October 2018). \"White Coke: The capitalist drink Soviet generals couldn't get enough of\".
