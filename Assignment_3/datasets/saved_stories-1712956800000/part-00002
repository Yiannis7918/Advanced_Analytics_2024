They\u2019ve really accelerated the\nrate of progress that we are all benefiting from now.\u201d\n\nJohn Brecher / Microsoft\n\nOpenAI\u2019s custom supercomputing system in Iowa\n\nThe report: On March 29, the Information reported that OpenAI and Microsoft\nare planning to spend up to $100 billion on a new data center project\ncontaining a supercomputer with \u201cmillions of specialized server chips.\u201d\n\nThe Information cited three anonymous sources it says have been involved in\nconversations about the project, including one who has spoken directly to\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman about it and one who has seen Microsoft\u2019s eye-popping\ncost estimates.\n\n> \u201cThese supercomputing systems are really the lifeblood of our research.\u201d\n>\n> Katie Mayer\n\nAccording to the Information\u2019s sources, the supercomputer is being called\n\u201cStargate,\u201d and it could launch as soon as 2028. It might then be expanded\nover the course of two years, with the final version requiring as much as 5\ngigawatts of power. (To put that in context, the largest nuclear power station\nin the US \u2014 Palo Verde in Arizona \u2014 has a total capacity of just 3.9\ngigawatts.)\n\nMicrosoft is also considering building a different, smaller supercomputer for\nOpenAI in Wisconsin. It could launch as soon as 2026 and cost up to $10\nbillion.\n\nOpenAI declined to comment on the report, while a Microsoft spokesperson\nissued a general statement that the company is \u201calways planning for the next\ngeneration of infrastructure innovations needed to continue pushing the\nfrontier of AI capability.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead: Seemingly little about the project has been decided, according\nto the Information \u2014 Microsoft and OpenAI are still contemplating where\nStargate should be located, which computer chips and cables to use, and how to\npower the whole operation, with nuclear energy being one possibility.\n\nRegardless of how the details shake out, if the project does come to fruition,\nthe processing power it would provide OpenAI could lead to the development of\nAIs with capabilities we can only dream about today \u2014 and maybe even the first\nartificial general intelligence.\n\nWe\u2019d love to hear from you!
