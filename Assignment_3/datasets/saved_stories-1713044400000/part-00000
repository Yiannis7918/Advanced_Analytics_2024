High performance engineering teams are downstream of\nculture, and a culture reigns supreme if it has internalized the primacy of\nwinning. Because winning is what matters. I\u2019m not talking about stock price or\nOKRs. I\u2019m talking about fulfilling your mission, delivering outcomes, and\ngoing faster, higher, and further than anyone thinks possible.\n\nWhat is a high-performing engineering team? A sufficient number of software\nupdates per hour? Crazy impressive DORA metrics? Elegant code that puts the\nbest Haskell poetry to shame? It\u2019s none of these things. A high-performing\nengineering team wins.\n\nJRock said it best: \u201cWin win win win win, fuck everything else, win.\u201d It\u2019s\nobvious, but not enough people think this way. Engineers get caught up in how\nthey want the world to work, how they\u2019ve been taught the world should work,\nbut they rarely understand how the world actually works. And you can\u2019t win if\nyou aren\u2019t living in reality. It\u2019s a natural human tendency to define the\nproblem based on what you can win at, but that is the ultimate corruption. You\nhave to take the red pill and see how far down the rabbit hole goes (18 years\nin, and I haven\u2019t hit bottom yet).\n\nRoadmaps, planning, communication, release notes, and the process du jour\naren\u2019t evil. But when process interferes with the primacy of winning, you\u2019re\ndoing it wrong. Besides, the number one reason people buy into process is\nbecause they want to avoid pain, and they believe things are supposed to get\nless painful over time. But as champion cyclist Greg LeMond said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t\nget any easier, you just go faster.\u201d You can\u2019t build greatness if your primary\nfeedback loop is built around pain avoidance. In reality there is no process,\nand it will be painful.\n\nAre you winning? Do more of that. Are you losing? Don\u2019t do that. You\u2019ll figure\nout the rest, but in this piece, I explain in detail some helpful things I\u2019ve\npicked up during my career to figure it out faster.\n\n## Missionaries vs. Mercenaries\n\nNo one has started a great company with the principal purpose of making money.\nThat\u2019s not a big enough \u201cwhy\u201d to bind you through the hard times, the near-\ndeath experiences when you\u2019re days away from running out of money, when you\nhave to pivot hard and blow up everyone\u2019s roadmaps, when great people leave\nyour team. There is no recovery from the congenital defect of choosing a bad\nquest.\n\nInstead, people need to wonder, \u201cIs this a cult or a company?\u201d\n\nHiring missionaries who pursue winning with a religious and existential zeal\nis key. These initial cohorts will create the environ. As mercenaries\n(inevitably) interview \u2014 and even if you should make a mistake and let one\nslip through \u2014 they will find your team of missionaries as acerbic as the\nmissionaries find them. Mercenaries are optimizing on their next job.\nMissionaries see this one as their only calling.\n\nShortly after Palantir started, investors and the few folks in the valley who\nwere into us wanted us to hire a well-known 1000x engineer. At this stage as a\ncompany, we had nothing. No product, no business, no traction. We were\ndesperate for any validation our model would work. And the fact that this\nengineering god would work at Palantir was very validating. The problem was,\nhe wanted $500k in cash (that 2004 cash salary expresses at $10 million 2024\nSilicon Valley dollars) and very clearly didn\u2019t value the equity we were\noffering him. Fundamentally, he was a mercenary. To him, Palantir wasn\u2019t a\ncalling. Not giving him the offer was so hard \u2014 our investors weren\u2019t happy\nand our own sense of self wobbled \u2014 but it led us to double down on the\nimportance of missionaries. From that point forward, all salaries were capped\nbelow market, but with generous equity. We were going to be a cult. It was\ngoing to be painful to join, so applicants needed to want to be on board\nbadly.\n\nRod Rhines was a U.S. Navy SEAL and CIA officer who tragically lost his life\nin a car accident in 2018. Rod led a lot of our early DOD (Department of\nDefense) work. He often told me he did more for his nation at Palantir than as\na SEAL or CIA officer. Don\u2019t let anyone into your engineering organization\nthat doesn\u2019t understand the privilege, obligation, and opportunity of your\nmission.\n\nRod on a humanitarian mission in Vanuvatu\n\n## The False Choice of Work-Life Balance\n\nIf you build a cult, you won\u2019t have to field too many questions about the\nfalse choice of work-life balance (another great example of how engineers want\nthe world to work). But inevitably you will get a few. Don\u2019t capitulate. You\nshould live your life however you want, but if you want to do great things,\nyou have to choose life over balance and commit to work so meaningful that you\nwouldn\u2019t want it to exist as a concept distinct from your life.\n\nExample: one of our first opportunities to deploy overseas came suddenly and\nall at once. We had spent time with the 10th Special Forces Group and their\ncommander at their home garrison at Ft. Carson, Colorado, as they were\npreparing to take over command of a base in Balad, Iraq. They had liked what\nwe showed them, but didn\u2019t have time to train up predeployment. Then suddenly,\nseveral weeks later, the call came with three days notice to drive our servers\nfrom Palo Alto to Colorado, palletize them, and grab four seats on the C-17\nthat would deliver them to Iraq. The crusty warrant officers didn\u2019t understand\nwhy they had to find space and housing for a few kids at the commander\u2019s\nrequest (Anduril cofounder and COO Matt Grimm was one of those kids). Two\nweeks later, after our team crushed many cans of Red Bull and made countless\ncommits, the units wouldn\u2019t go on missions without Palantir.\n\nMatt Grimm (left), summer of 2009, Iraq\n\nShortly before that, we had been training with the 5th Stryker Brigade Combat\nTeam, 2nd Infantry Division, in anticipation of their deployment to Iraq. This\nwas during the depths of a brutal conflict between combat units and Army\nbureaucracy around an Army intel platform that cost billions of dollars and\ndidn\u2019t work. The combat units wanted Palantir. The 5th Stryker Brigade Combat\nTeam was asking for Palantir. But the bureaucrats won \u2014 5/2 found out while\nfinishing training that not only were they now going to Afghanistan instead of\nIraq, they were also going without Palantir. The first few months of their\ndeployment was carnage \u2014 they lost a lot of lives. This led them to call us up\nto figure out how they could get our software. Unfortunately, we had\ndeprioritized a bunch of the capabilities they needed months ago when we\nlearned they wouldn\u2019t be using us. It was a whole-of-company effort over the\nnext month to catch up. We tore up our roadmaps and organized around the\nproblem. It was quite literally lives over balance.\n\nIn 2016, we expanded our product focus from intelligence analysis to mission\nplanning and battle management, building a new product called Gaia. There was\nno flow state, neat OKRs, or planning documents because we were in Iraq, with\nno space on base, sleeping on cold concrete floors, committing code and\nresponding to feedback real time. Born during the Battle of Mosul, Gaia\u2019s\nfirst job was on this rescue mission of CNN journalists. Most Palantir\nproducts have an origin story like this \u2014 a conscious rejection of work-life\nbalance in favor of something greater.\n\n## Real Growth Will Never Not Be Painful\n\nSometimes you need painkillers, but don\u2019t confuse them for medicine. Levels,\nladders, and any form of ex-ante performance expectation neatly codified into\na rubric or guide are lies. They\u2019re corporate opioids that keep the masses\npliant and \u2018productive\u2019 as batteries in a vast matrix. The companies that are\nreally good at telling their employees about their career growth make them\nfeel great but deliver no actual growth.\n\nReal growth is scary, hard, periodic, non-linear, and responsive to the\nenvironment. It doesn't happen on schedule, and it is subject to periods of\nintense activity.\n\nBruce Banner didn\u2019t become the Incredible Hulk by lifting a little bit more\neveryday. It took a near-fatal dose of gamma rays to unleash his potential.\nAnd it felt awful. If you love your employees, regularly expose them to gamma\nrays by throwing them off the deep end. Put them in roles that stretch and\neven tear them. If you aren\u2019t constantly talent spotting and taking bets,\nyou\u2019re doing it wrong. If no one at your company who has been there three\nmonths is leading an effort with people who have been there three years,\nyou\u2019re doing it wrong.\n\nNone of our leaders followed a conventional path. Khan Tasinga joined Palantir\nshortly before our first DOD deployment in 2008 as part of the effort to\ndefeat improvised explosive devices. As with any first deployment, things were\nrough. Most of the engineering organization wanted the field team to send the\ndebug logs and stacktraces back to Palo Alto. They wanted to be efficient. But\nKhan was not most people. He recognized efficiency was an illusion, and he\ncommitted to doing the hard work, onsite, in the windowless Sensitive\nCompartmented Information Facility (SCIF): pounding through logs, decompiling\njars, and shipping fixes and monkey patches to solve problems. Technically\nhired outside the core engineering team, he stepped in and stepped up, pushing\nhimself and all of us. It was three weeks of 18-hour days \u2014 his immense dose\nof gamma rays. He threw himself at every hard problem, and these experiences\ncompounded. Khan eventually went on to run all of engineering.\n\nMark Scianna is another great example. Mark joined Palantir as a quality\nengineer outside of core dev. No one at the company spent more time supporting\nwarfighters in Denied, Disrupted, Intermittent, and Limited (DDIL) network\nenvironments, and no one had a sharper sense of what was needed and what could\nwork in these areas. When his pleas to redesign our flagship Nexus Peering\ntechnology weren\u2019t gaining traction with the engineering organization and its\nsenior leaders, Mark and a few others set off during a single week to hack\ntogether the poetically named \u201cRed-Headed Step Child\u201d project. He was right,\nand the red-headed progeny of Nexus Peering still drives global operations\ntoday.\n\nMark Scianna on his way to Afghanistan to deliver our first forward laptops to\n5/2 users, 2010\n\n## Create an Artist Colony, Not a Factory\n\nManagement\u2019s desire to scale in repeatable ways and reduce pain leads most\norganizations to scale like a factory. This approach requires interchangeable\nparts, people, and functions. Human interfaces define how the various teams\ninteract with finance, recruiting, and themselves. Levels provide a clean way\nto handle comp conversations and keep talent on a conveyor belt. Coarsely\ndefined roles let recruiting trawl the vast ocean for Software Engineer IIs.\nThis cog-oriented approach elevates process over content, breeds conformity,\nand imposes a mimetic, self-limiting conception of the role. It makes it easy\nto lose sight of the primacy of winning.\n\nInstead, you want to be an artist colony. What does managing and leading 10 of\nthe world\u2019s greatest artists look like? It isn\u2019t command and control. It\ndoesn\u2019t hew to any structure or strictures. Instead, the leader must maximize\nthe unique strengths of each individual in the colony \u2014 with the right person\nin the right role in the right time \u2014 to produce a great work of art.\n\nAlso keep in mind that not every work by an artist is going to be beautiful,\nbecause artists go through periods and phases, so you have to be committed to\nthe incredible talent of your 1000x engineers and producers through their ups\nand downs. Episodic hits transform your business.\n\nArtists are attitudinally anti-authoritarian. We love and encourage that. When\nI interact with new hires in AMAs, I always end them by asking them to tell me\nto \u201cfuck off\u201d in unison. Mark Scianna\u2019s Red-Headed Step Child was one such\nrebellion. But one rebellion started it all. Dan Cervelli, now known to be a\nfront-end god, was a new hire in 2008 and a former volcanologist. He was\narguing with Bob McGrew, now VP of Research at OpenAI, about building a new\nmap in Gotham, our battlefield intelligence product which has since evolved.\nBob, who was head of the project at the time, didn\u2019t believe it was feasible.\nDan did, and what he built during one of our hack weeks was so eye-watering\nthat we reorganized violently around it (much to Bob\u2019s credit). It changed the\ntrajectory of our business, not only because his product was so good, but\nbecause it encouraged us to allow Dan to continuously throw himself off the\ndeep end in pursuit of his convictions and intuitions.\n\n## The Necessity of Chaos\n\nChaos feels bad, but structure is anti-creative. So much of a conventionally\ndefined, well-run engineering organization is built to eliminate chaos by\ncreating legibility and clarity, and avoiding \u201cwasted\u201d work. Project\nassessments are always retrospective \u2014 upon completion, there\u2019s a tendency to\ndetermine that the frustration and pain the team experienced to meet the\nobjective were unnecessary, and in the future should be avoided through the\nimposition of more order and process. But this is almost always wrong. You\nwant to get there quickly, not painlessly. Every lesson you can learn about\ngoing faster is likely right; every lesson aimed at reducing chaos alone is\nlikely wrong.\n\nAt its best, the engineering organization metabolizes pain and excretes\nproduct.\n\nSome degree of flux, confusion, and chaos is a precondition to creativity. You\nwant to be effective before you worry about being efficient. In the zero to\none stage of any project, it should be chaotic (or you\u2019ve already lost). Five-\nto-N is well-suited to structured approaches that drive repeatability. Thus\nthe R&D product transition that happens when a product goes from one-to-five\nis always the most painful. The humans who did the scrappy, zero-to-one work\nsee the world in irreconcilably different ways from the humans who must now\nscale this work by imposing some semblance of process. Managing the colony\nthrough this chaotic, interpersonal friction is your privilege.\n\nWhen Google walked away from Project Maven, the groundbreaking DOD AI\nwarfighting initiative, Palantir stepped in. The project called for a complete\nreimagination and fusion of intelligence and operations. We already had\npowerful pieces of the puzzle, but a lot of entirely new things needed to be\nbuilt, and it wasn\u2019t at all clear what those pieces were and what they should\ndo. Classic zero to one. The team took over my D.C. office as a colocation\nspace. And when they weren\u2019t in D.C., they were in Afghanistan, Iraq,\nDjibouti, and other places working with operators.\n\nThe traction was immediate and intense, but so was the friction when I had to\npull in more teams to mainline the effort. Roadmaps were at risk. Requirements\nwere hazy. The ambiguity made problem decomp and clarity hard. There wasn\u2019t\ngoing to be a linear path conducive to flow to get from here to there. This is\nperhaps why so much of the DOD\u2019s R&D fails to transition to production.\nScaling innovative product is not reducible to Gantt charts, milestones, and\nexcessive requirements. To the extent it\u2019s a \u201cprocess,\u201d it\u2019s one that requires\nexceptional individuals who are willing to forge a unique path each and every\ntime.\n\nWe built so much epic shit because of the chaos during Maven. And it was\nepically painful, one of the most painful experiences I\u2019ve had, because of the\nchaos. And I would do it all again. Just look at the outcomes.\n\n## Superpowers and Kryptonite\n\nExceptional people are highly uneven. Very few, if any, are well-rounded. Thus\nthe winning team has exceptional abilities, deep flaws, and complicated\npersonalities. These unique humans have superpowers, but they likely don\u2019t\nactually know what they are. Your job is to help them discover their\nsuperpowers and manage them to peak performance.\n\nX-ray vision, the ability to fly: these were just some of Superman\u2019s powers.\nBut they weren\u2019t hard for him, they were natural and effortless. Likewise,\nmost people don\u2019t know what their superpowers are because they\u2019re not\ndifficult to exercise, and unfortunately, talented people tend to believe that\nwhat they wish they were good at are their superpowers. A simple way to sort\nthis out is to help them look at an ability they wish they had and help them\nsee if they are two or three standard deviations away from genpop (likely not)\n\u2014 and compare that to their effortless superpower, where they are probably\nmany more deviations away.\n\nSimilarly, it isn\u2019t Superman\u2019s fault that kryptonite is his weakness. It just\nis. There\u2019s no cure for it, and only one solution: avoid kryptonite at all\ncosts. All exceptionally talented people have kryptonite. Your job is to help\nyour talent discover and accept that in a world that has taught them it\u2019s\nfatal to admit to any weakness you can\u2019t improve. You need to teach them the\nopposite is true: weaknesses don\u2019t hold you back unless you\u2019re in denial about\nthem.\n\nI discovered my kryptonite when, after truthfully answering a seemingly\ninnocuous question from a congressional staffer about which agency was most\nbehind on technology adoption, our team found all our badges to that\norganization\u2019s buildings deactivated the next morning. Guileless engineer\nmeets D.C. power politics.\n\nWinning comes from the power law returns of maximizing superpowers and\nminimizing kryptonite. Despite what conventional HR professionals tell you,\nleave the rest unmanaged.\n\n## Decoupling Position and Portfolio\n\nIn the traditional model, employees embody a defined position with a defined\nportfolio. The chief virtues (vices, really) of this approach are\npredictability and legibility. This is why conventional, status-driven\norganizations are so often ruthless and dysfunctional. You can only be really\naggressive and formal about promoting leaders if you're equally aggressive\nabout firing leaders. This dynamic is inherently pro-mercenary.\n\nThe alternative model is the artist colony, where position and portfolio are\nnot only decoupled, but position itself is an arbitrary construct \u2014 there are\nonly artists and their work. Decoupling position and portfolio enables you to\nmanage your artists to their superpowers and apply them to the company\u2019s most\npressing challenges. This approach also allows you to manage them out of their\nweaknesses without humiliating or breaking them, whereas in a traditional\norganization, taking away a portfolio or position implies an embarrassing loss\nof status.\n\nThe fundamental fluidity of portfolio and position constitutes the artist\ncolony's greatest inherent advantage (and challenge). This approach is not a\npanacea of any kind \u2014 it requires constant engagement and examination. But it\ncan be an unfair advantage to winning.\n\n## The Quantum Org Structure\n\nIs the right org structure functional, matrixed, cross-functional, something\nelse? Yes and no. Both. It\u2019s like asking if light is a wave or a particle.\n\nThat\u2019s because the best org structure is quantum. It\u2019s both flat and\nhierarchical, functional and horizontal. For a point in time it manifests in\nan observed state when you organize around the problem that needs to be solved\nright now. Then it reorganizes around the next problem with a different\nstructure more appropriate to the new challenge. Your people will hate this\nbecause it seems chaotic, and the common belief is that the \u2018correct\u2019 approach\nis one that\u2019s well-ordered.\n\nBut that isn\u2019t true. To win today, solve for the right structure. To win\ntomorrow, solve for the right structure again.\n\nBroken companies have to reorg at great expense because they pick a structure,\noptimizing for legibility and planning for a world that inevitably stops\nexisting, purely due to the entropy of the universe over time.\n\nCode delivery is continuous and always optimized for winning. Your flying\nformation should be the same.\n\n## Building the Right Things vs. Building the Right Way\n\nBroadly speaking, there are two types of engineers: hackers and artists. To\npaint a caricature, hackers derive joy and satisfaction out of solving a\nproblem in the world \u2014 building the right things \u2014 but they are likely to do\nit in a way that doesn\u2019t scale. Artists derive joy and satisfaction out of\nbuilding a beautiful product the right way, but whether it solves a problem is\ncompletely beside the point.\n\nIf your team is made up of only one of these types of engineers, you\u2019ll fail.\nAll value comes from a managed misalignment between building the right things\nand building things the right way. Building the right thing is really hard.\nIt\u2019s the first 80% of the work. Building things the right way is really hard.\nIt\u2019s the second 80% of the work. Each type undervalues the contributions and\ndifficulty of the other\u2019s work, and there will be endless, unsolvable tension\nhere \u2014 if you are lucky (that means you\u2019re doing it right).\n\nIn 2006, Alex Karp asked me if I knew why French restaurants were so good. I\nhad no idea. He told me that at a French restaurant, the wait staff is\nactually part of the kitchen staff. They intimately understand the food, the\nmethodology, and the technique. They are not merely carrying the food from the\nkitchen to the table, but are instead part of a subtle and complex system that\naffects kitchen operations. He wanted me to build that, but for engineering.\n\nI did just that, and in 2007, I gave it the name \u201cforward deployed\nengineering\u201d (FDE) in homage to our customers. FDEs embed alongside our\ncustomers and work to ensure our software solves their problem and not some\nproxy for their problem. They\u2019re crazy enough to get on a last-minute plane to\nIraq, they\u2019re smart enough to ship quality, same-day code, and their EQ is\nstill high enough to talk to users (and maybe even enjoy it). Investors\nridiculed us for creating a \u201cservices\u201d role that would only serve to depress\nthe margins of a software company. We didn\u2019t look like the other SaaS\nbusinesses, something they eventually realized was a feature, not a bug. Just\nlike French restaurants don\u2019t blindly hand off food from an uninformed waiter\nto the diner, we didn\u2019t believe in throwing our software over the wall in the\nhopes the customer would divine the correct meaning from it. This approach\nbuilt an engineering organization with unmatched creativity, responsiveness,\nand focus on the primacy of winning.\n\n## Kill the Orcs!\n\nIn Middle Earth, the Orcs spawned in the seams of the world. In this realm,\nthe Orcs spawn in the seams between teams, generating dysfunction in a\nmalevolent bid to block the engineering organization from delivering valuable\nbits at the right time to the right user. As a leader, managing, mending, and\nmerging those seams is a crucial responsibility. Organizing around the problem\nwill help you win here.\n\nWe grew up as company that proudly built and shipped monoliths. Our software\nprovided an exquisite and integrated user experience. It just worked the way\nyou expected it to. This was wonderful for our users and incredibly painful\nfor us. Releases were a huge pain. Upgrades sucked. Managing quality in\nmission-critical environments was brutal. I can remember more than one upgrade\nthat exceeded its outage window (remember those days where when you used to\nhave outage windows?) and missions had to be scrubbed as a result. I never\nwant to feel that shitty again.\n\nWe built Apollo to solve this. It enabled each dev team to be operationally\nresponsible for their products across nearly 1,000 production environments,\nincluding nearly 100 air-gapped environments. It could manage each\nenvironment, its blue/green upgrades, rollbacks, CVEs \u2014 everything that was\npainful for the engineering team at scale and speed.\n\nApollo let us ship at blinding speed. But what we soon realized was that the\nblinding speed came at the expense of delivering an integrated user\nexperience. Teams could now ship independently, without coordinating, and this\nencouraged people to build things with blinders on as to what was happening\nelsewhere. Unintentionally, Apollo had expanded the seams between the teams.\nWe had to build a series of new muscles \u2014 moving the front-end back to a\nmonorepo, growing new product muscle, changing the surface area of product\nownership and tens of other small changes to regain the advantage and be able\nto both deliver 90,000 upgrades a week and a winning user experience. This is\na problem you manage, not solve. Kill the Orcs!\n\nInternal propaganda poster I had put up everywhere in the office when we had a\npeak orc attack\n\n## The Truth is Out There\n\nThere is only the primacy (and finality) of winning. The right answers, the\nbig gaps, and the valuable ideas have to be mined in the field, hidden within\nthe chaos and crisis of the outside world.\n\nAsk yourself constantly, \u201cAm I winning?\u201c If the answer is yes, nothing else\nmatters \u2014 chaos is tolerable; pain is tolerable. The only thing that matters\nis to win.\n\n\u2014Shyam Sankar\n\nGet the Industry newsletter\n\nThe business of technology\n\nSign in\n\n0 free articles left\n\nPlease sign-in to comment\n\nThere are no comments yet.
