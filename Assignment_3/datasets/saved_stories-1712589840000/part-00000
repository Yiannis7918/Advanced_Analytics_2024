Since leaving that previous life, he has\ntraveled the world providing high-level (cyber threat) intelligence briefings\nto multinational organizations\u2014the kinds of briefings that require a series of\nprior coordination meetings with corporate lawyers and lots of signatures on\nmulti-page non-disclosure agreements (NDAs).\n\nRegardless of the time of year or the location of each briefing, Ryan\u2019s\nroutine is always the same\u2014he would spend the entire day before the briefing\ncarrying out a specific set of activities in almost sequential order: spend an\nhour reading the local newspaper over and drinking black coffee at a local\nfamily-owned coffee shop; then he would head over to a nearby library to\n(re)read the first 60-80 pages of his copy of Religion and the Decline of\nMagic by Keith Thomas. Afterward, he would eat lunch at a nearby restaurant\nrecommended by the front desk employee at the local library, and then return\nto his hotel room to take a two-hour nap. After the nap, he would email his\npoint of contact at the client organization to confirm details and other\nlogistics for the briefing the following day. The check-in email is usually\nfollowed by calls to different people back home\u2014his partner, his two sons,\ntheir mom\u2014his ex-wife\u2014and a few close friends. He would then head over to the\nhotel\u2019s bar for a glass of red wine, grab some snacks on the way back to his\nroom, and eventually fall asleep.\n\nPhoto by Kyle Glenn on Unsplash\n\n##\n\nThe Briefing\n\nRyan\u2019s January 2024 briefing in New York City had been rescheduled twice since\nearly November 2023 to accommodate two board members who had to fly in from\nTel Aviv (Israel) and \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (Poland). The briefing itself was an ad-hoc, all-\nhands-on-deck, in-person-only briefing for the client\u2019s C-Suite and board\nmembers, to help them understand the impact of ongoing events in the Middle\nEast on their organization\u2019s global operations.\n\nSince late 2023, conflicts in the Middle East, spanning Iraq, Turkey, Syria,\nYemen, Israel/Palestine, and Armenia/Azerbaijan, have posed significant\nphysical and cyber threats to multinational organizations operating across\nEurope and the Middle East, including Ryan\u2019s client.\n\nThe briefing began right after Ryan was called in from the waiting area\noutside the boardroom. He started his presentation with an outline:\n\n  * the sources and methods his team used to gather and analyze intelligence based on the specific requirements the client provided;\n\n  * a detailed analysis of the cyber threats discovered; and\n\n  * the implications of the cyber threats to the organization\u2019s strategic interests, operations, and competitive standing in the Middle East and elsewhere.\n\n##\n\nSources & Methods\n\nBecause of the nature of the specific threat to his client, Ryan\u2019s team\nfocused on three primary intelligence sources: open source intelligence\n(OSINT), human intelligence (HUMINT), and signals intelligence (SIGINT).\n\nOSINT\n\nRyan\u2019s team monitored non-English-language local media outlets, websites,\nblogs, social media platforms, and online forums in the Middle East for any\ndevelopments indicating shifts in cyber espionage tactics or targets. They\ndeployed social media analysis tools to identify trends and sentiment related\nto cyber threats and geopolitical events. They also used natural language\nprocessing (NLP) tools to analyze vast amounts of textual data for relevant\ninformation. In addition, they used automated web scraping tools to collect\ncontextual data as needed, and regularly checked technical databases and\nrepositories that list vulnerabilities, cyber attacks, and threat actors\u2019\nknown tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).\n\nHUMINT\n\nRyan\u2019s team maintained a network of contacts within industries and government\nagencies who could provide insights into emerging threats and the\n(geo)political landscape worldwide, including the Middle East. This network\nallowed them to gather valuable insider information from employees or partners\nin regions affected directly and indirectly by Middle Eastern tensions to the\nextent that it was legally, ethically, and morally allowable.\n\nSIGINT\n\nThe client organization had provided Ryan and his team some level of access\ninto their network. This access allowed them to analyze network traffic logs\nto identify patterns indicative of espionage activities or other suspicious\nand abnormal activities such as phishing campaigns, malware distribution, or\ncommand and control server communications. They also analyzed publicly\navailable forensic analyses of past cyber attacks against other organizations\nin their client\u2019s industry, security reports and threat intelligence feeds\nfrom cybersecurity firms and alliances, and reports from cyber threat\nintelligence platforms to aggregate and analyze information on indicators of\ncompromise (IOCs), TTPs, and to track threat actors.\n\n##\n\nIntegration and Analysis\n\nRyan used two approaches to present the outcome of how his team integrated the\nintelligence they had gathered from diverse sources: threat modeling and\nscenario planning.\n\nThreat Modeling\n\nWithin the context of his client\u2019s Middle East operations, Ryan\u2019s team was\nable to identify three main potential threat actors, including state-sponsored\ngroups, terrorist organizations, and cybercriminals, each of them with\ndistinct motivations and methods. The state-sponsored (or state-sanctioned)\nthreat actors may engage in cyber espionage or sabotage against his client to\nfurther national interests. Terrorist groups could target his client\u2019s\nphysical assets to disrupt operations or leverage cyberattacks for propaganda,\nwhile cybercriminals might aim for financial gain through ransomware\noperations or data theft.\n\nAs for capabilities, state-sponsored groups often deploy sophisticated tools\nand resources, enabling them to carry out advanced persistent threats (APTs)\nand cyber espionage. Terrorist organizations might have less sophisticated\ncapabilities but can execute significant physical threats or insider attacks.\nOn the other hand, cybercriminals frequently exploit known vulnerabilities and\nengage in social engineering to breach networks.\n\nBased on Ryan\u2019s team\u2019s assessment, the likely targets within his client\u2019s\nMiddle East operations include:\n\n  * data centers (for cyber espionage or ransomware attacks),\n\n  * proprietary information (related to negotiations, strategies, or innovations), and\n\n  * personnel (for insider threats or social engineering).\n\nScenario Planning\n\nFor the other component of integration and analysis, Ryan\u2019s presentation\noutlined detailed scenarios that map out future states of his client\u2019s threat\nlandscape, ranging from most likely to highly speculative and covering a\nspectrum of potential cyber incidents such as data breaches, ransomware\nattacks, infrastructure sabotage, and others. Each scenario was carefully\ndesigned to reflect the unique geopolitical, economic, and social contexts of\nthe Middle East, recognizing that cyber threats in this region often intersect\nwith political tensions and economic instabilities.\n\nPersonally, Ryan believes that scenario planning helps foster a culture of\npreparedness and resilience. Hence, he ensures his team incorporates it into\nevery analysis they produce. Clients are not only tasked with identifying\npotential vulnerabilities and assessing their impact but also with developing\nstrategic responses that are both adaptive and robust. This may involve\nstrengthening cyber defenses, building redundancy into critical systems,\nestablishing incident response protocols, and fostering partnerships with\nlocal and international cybersecurity entities.\n\nIn addition, scenario planning demands continuous refinement. As new\nintelligence on cyber threats emerges, scenarios must be updated, and\nstrategies recalibrated, ensuring that organizational responses remain\nrelevant and effective. This iterative process underscores the dynamic nature\nof cybersecurity, where static defenses are not enough, and agility and\nforesight are paramount.\n\nIn essence, scenario planning\u2014grounded in comprehensive intelligence gathering\non cyber threats\u2014equips organizations like Ryan\u2019s client with a significant\nfootprint in the Middle East with the strategic foresight needed to navigate\nthe complexities of the digital age. By preparing for several future\npossibilities, these organizations guarantee their resilience against cyber\nthreats and secure a competitive advantage in an increasingly volatile\nregional landscape. This approach represents a strategic imperative in a world\nwhere the cyber domain is a critical battlefield for economic, political, and\nsocial influence.\n\n##\n\nThreat Implications\n\nThe last section of Ryan\u2019s presentation outlined the implications of the\nidentified threats to the organization\u2019s strategic interests, operations, and\ncompetitive standing in the Middle East and elsewhere.\n\nRegional Disparities\n\nThe geopolitical fragmentation and varying cyber capabilities across the\nMiddle East could invariably lead to an uneven threat landscape. Threat actors\nmight exploit weaker cyber defenses in conflict zones for initial ingress,\nsubsequently pivoting to more secure networks within his client\u2019s footprint.\n\nCyber Espionage and Information Warfare\n\nGenerally, global conflicts are hotbeds for cyber espionage and information\nwarfare, aiming to undermine state entities, influence public opinion, and\nsteal intellectual property. Ryan\u2019s client could be caught in the crossfire,\neither as direct targets or collateral damage. Strategic intelligence must\ntherefore encompass multiple intelligence sources (OSINT, HUMINT, SIGINT, and\nothers) to understand the informational threats and develop countermeasures\nagainst misinformation and propaganda that could affect business operations or\nreputation.\n\nRansomware and DDoS Extortion\n\nThe ensuing chaos and need for funding within conflict zones may embolden\ncybercriminals to launch ransomware attacks against organizations perceived as\ncapable of paying significant ransoms. Such attacks disrupt operations and\npose a risk to sensitive data. Ryan outlined a robust cyber situational\nawareness framework for his client to identify and mitigate ransomware threats\nthrough cybersecurity hygiene, employee awareness, and incident response\nplanning.\n\nSupply Chain Vulnerabilities\n\nRyan\u2019s client\u2019s suppliers and partners in the Middle East may become\ncompromised, thereby serving as conduits for cyberattacks. His team advised\nthat scenario planning must extend to third-party risk management,\ncontinuously assessing and securing the supply chain from potential cyber\nthreats emanating from or exacerbated by regional conflicts.\n\nPhoto by Rohit Tandon on Unsplash\n\nIf you like what you just read, let\u2019s connect on LinkedIn or buy me a coffee.\n\nShare\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Second-Order Consequences\n\nbidemiologunde.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nOperation Golden Dome\n\nA DDoS Extortion Incident in Denver, Colorado, Followed by Tampering with MX\nRecords\n\nMar 29 \u2022\n\nBidemi Ologunde\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Operation Golden Dome\n\nbidemiologunde.substack.com\n\nPerverse Incentives and Bad Outcomes\n\nAn AI training data exposure that led to an Emotet campaign - the story of a\nbrand marketing agency in Orlando, Florida\n\nApr 1 \u2022\n\nBidemi Ologunde\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Perverse Incentives and Bad Outcomes\n\nbidemiologunde.substack.com\n\nSky-High Risks: The Hidden Dangers of Airplane WiFi\n\nWhat Airlines Are Not Telling You About Your Connection\n\nMar 25 \u2022\n\nBidemi Ologunde\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Sky-High Risks: The Hidden Dangers of Airplane WiFi\n\nbidemiologunde.substack.com\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Bidemi Ologunde\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great writing\n\nShare\n\n", "frontpage": false}
