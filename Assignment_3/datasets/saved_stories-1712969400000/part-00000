For\noutdoor photographers, capturing the decisive moment of a living creature or\nan awe-inspiring landscape photograph is paramount.\"\n\nIt's easy to assume that this just refers to the OM-1 and OM-5 models the\ncompany has updated since taking on the former Olympus camera business, but\nTogashi suggests this isn't the case: \"Our definition of outdoor use extends\nbeyond just the adventurous; it encompasses outdoor activities in everyday\nlife as well. Our system is ideal for individuals who enjoy capturing\nsnapshots, macro shots while traveling, or shoot astrophotography.\"\n\nIt may be seen as a step down from the PEN F, and it isn't currently sold in\nNorth America, but OM System does still make and sell PEN-series\ncameras.Image: OM System  \n---  \n  \nCould this mean a revival of the PEN line, we asked. \"In Japan and Asia we\ncontinue to sell PEN E-P7,\" he reminded us: \"The E-P7 is small, with compact\nbright lenses, making it highly advantageous for travel photography.\nTherefore, we\u2019ll reinforce such products in our lineup in the future.\"\n\nTogashi didn't explicitly say that this means a return of the PEN line to\nNorth America, but says: \"We\u2019d like to try to expand the scope of people\nenjoying cameras for travels or for everyday use to capture scenery.\"\n\n> \"The E-P7 is ... highly advantageous for travel photography ... we\u2019ll\n> reinforce such products in our lineup in the future.\"\n\nFor now, at least, the company's focus seems to be on higher-end products: \u201cWe\nanticipate that photography enthusiasts will remain central to driving growth\nin our industry,\" says Togashi. But, he added, it's important to attract new\naudiences to photography, identifying those \"who currently lack an interest in\ncameras,\" as an opportunity for the industry.\n\n\"We firmly believe that maintaining a stable business scale has broader\nbenefits for all customers,\" he reasons: \"Conversely, a shrinking market\ncauses challenges for manufacturers in innovating and developing new\ntechnologies. Therefore, it\u2019s crucial to explore new potential customer\nsegments. In the world of photography, acknowledging the diverse needs is\nparamount. By recognizing various perspectives on photography, camera\nequipment and the art of capturing images, we anticipate the entry of new\ncustomers into the fold more effectively.\u201d\n\n### Trends and the role of AI\n\nWe asked Togashi about the significant trends OM System has seen in the past\nyear. \"I think the most significant trend in imaging has been the advancement\nof image processing applications and AI-driven noise reduction techniques.\nThese innovations have greatly progressed the industry.\u201d\n\nWe asked whether he thought AI has a different role to play in cameras than in\nsmartphones. \"I believe the role will vary,\" he says. \"In terms of\ncomputational photography for cameras, we see its potential to revolutionize\nart creation and broaden photographers\u2019 expressive capabilities.\"\n\nAs an example, he highlights a feature from the company's latest model:\n\"photographers who may have shied away from using Graduated Neutral Density\n[GND] filters due to their perceived complexity could find these features\ninvaluable. Additionally, for photographers accustomed to employing GND\nfilters and post-processing their images, we believe that integrating Live GND\nduring shooting to capture high-quality Raw images, followed by fine-tuning\ndetail in editing software can give artwork that exceeds expectations. For\nsmartphones their role is to record everyday life, beautifully. This is\ntotally different: between artwork and recording something.\u201d\n\nTogashi highlights the virtual GND filter feature of the OM-1 Mark II, but\nsuggests it would be very difficult to offer a comparable feature in the\noriginal model, as the memory handling of the camera has been re-\nwritten.Photo: Shaminder Dulai  \n---  \n  \n\"As technology advances in the future, personally I think it will be possible\nto integrate such an AI noise reduction function into the camera body. But\nmaybe it will be challenging to realize this.\"\n\nWe wondered whether collaboration between cameras companies might be an\neffective way to compete with the R&D budgets of the biggest smartphone\nmakers.\n\n\u201cIf our company had an opportunity to collaborate with other companies, maybe\nwe would collaborate with an image processing software company, maybe.\" But\nthere are areas in which Togashi thinks the industry should co-operate: \"As a\ncamera industry, we may have to consider technology to judge: is this picture\na real one or a fake? For such kinds of things, maybe we should collaborate\nwith all kinds of companies to develop such technology through using AI\ntechnology.\u201d\n\n### The future for video\n\nAs the conversation continued, the topic turned to video, who's using it and\nwhat's required to make it useful to a wider audience.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of the usage of our video features through our customer research\ndata,\" Togashi says: \"Encouraging more people to use a dedicated camera to\nshoot video, instead of using a smartphone, is less about technical\nspecifications and more about creating opportunities for users to engage with\nvideo. Just as with photography for those who want to start photography.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur user research findings show that people who don\u2019t have high knowledge or\nlong experience of video shooting have some concerns about how to enjoy and\nhow to edit video. Therefore I think such user-friendly functions are very\nimportant to expand more fans to use video functions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe it\u2019s important to have functions and services that allow people to\nenjoy shooting video more easily, without specialized knowledge or expensive\nediting equipment.\"\n\n### OM-1 firmware\n\nFinally, we asked about the OM-1 and the launch of the Mark II and whether\nMark I owners can expect further updates. \"OM-1 users can expect some\nadditional functionalities as a result of firmware updates we announced on\nFeb. 21, 2024.\" says Togashi. But he also says it's not possible to simply\nduplicate all the OM-1 Mark II's features in the older model. \"The OM-1 Mark\nII has increased internal memory and new optimized memory controls compared to\nthe OM-1, so providing all the new features to the mark one is not possible.\"\n\nThis article was based on an interview conducted by Dale Baskin and Richard\nButler at the CP+ show in Yokohama, Japan.\n\nTags: micro-four-thirds, om-1, om-digital-solutions, om-system, pen\n\nView Comments (253)\n\n## Comments\n\nAll (253)\n\nMost popular (15)\n\nEditors' picks (1)\n\nDPR staff (0)\n\nOldest first\n\nComments on this article may be moderated before they are made public.

Someday, I hope to buy an E-PL7 just to round\nout the collection. I'd consider upgrading to a current PEN model...but I need\nan EVF. Nothing in the current PEN lineup offers an EVF.\n\nIf you've never seen or used it, the \"AP2\" accessory port on Olympus cameras\nbetween about 2011 and 2018 was the best compromise I've encountered in terms\nof portability and usability. I have a VF-3 and a VF-4, removable electronic\nviewfinders that I can click into my PEN cameras (or even my point-and-shoot\nXZ-1) when I want a viewfinder.

But I am\nafraid m43 is a non sustainable camera segment in the long run. NOT because\nthe cameras aren\u2019t any good, but because the traditional buyers in the segment\nof low end cameras have fallen away.\n\nThe enthusiasts whom remain and whom are vivid supporters of the m43 system\nare not enough in numbers to keep this business afloat.\n\nThere is a reason why Sony, Canon and Nikon have mostly dropped support for\nsmaller sensor sized systems and why Fujifilm has entered the Small Medium\nFormat market. It is to be profitable while being able to sell less cameras.\nAnd yet they are all still facing challenges as the need for replacement is\nless than it ever was before.\n\nIt is going to be challenging times ahead for all camera manufacturers the\nfuture is not bright. Yet those whom failed to adapt to these new\ncircumstances are vulnerable and will fall.\n\nReply\n\nLike\n\n9\n\n3 days agopermalink\n\nReport\n\ndmanthree\n\nSorry to say I think you're right. M4/3 has so much to offer; good IQ, smaller\nand lighter lenses, etc. But, well, the lure of FF is too much. And with\nsmaller FF cams (Sony A7c) the size and weight advantage is lessened. Oh,\nwell.\n\nLike\n\n1\n\n2 days agopermalink\n\nReport\n\nDave Etchells\n\nThat could be, but OM does have a unique niche in the outdoor/nature/adventure\ncategory. If the smaller sensor is acceptable (which it is for me personally\n99% of the time), the reduced bulk of a system including several lenses\ncompared to a FF system is dramatic. FF bodies can be very compact, but the\nbigger image circle and longer absolute focal lengths for a given FOV\ntranslate into a huge difference in overall system weight.\n\nOther brands have caught up with IS (Olympus was way ahead of others at one\npoint) and somewhat in weather sealing, but for a portable system that just\ndoesn't care what kind of downpour you're shooting in, the OM System is still\na standout.\n\nI think their biggest issue is just communicating these advantages strongly\nenough. You don't have to be an adventure photographer to appreciate a\nlightweight system and superb weather sealing. But neither is apparent to\nshoppers just reading spec sheets or online reviews of just a camera or lens\non its own.\n\nLike\n\n6\n\n1 day agopermalink\n\nReport\n\nAbrasiveReducer\n\nI plan to use my m43 stuff until somebody makes a 70-200 lens for full frame\nthat's sharp and weighs 9 ounces. But m43 faces headwinds that no amount of\nmarketing can fix. Consumer electronics is all about specs. Think of the\nstereo speakers that go beyond human hearing. Gotta have 'em, and Sony\nunderstands this. Using the same reasoning, Olympus and Panasonic should have\n40 mp sensors in their m43 cameras by now. Would it make a difference to most\nusers? No. But it would make a marketing argument to upgrade, not \"side\ngrade\".\n\nAs a still photographer who wants to travel light and not make prints bigger\nthan a barn, the only feature my OMD3 has that my Pen-F lacks is handheld high\nres and that's not essential. In fact, the Pen-F has features than could have\nbeen omitted, like effect filters that generate tons of extra files while\ndoing something that's easier to accomplish with NIK or something similar.\n\nFor $2000, what would a new Pen-F offer besides 26mp instead of 20?\n\nLike\n\n1 day agopermalink\n\nReport\n\nGourmet Chef\n\nI am sorry Dave - But I see this very differently.\n\nIt is not about their advertising or message not coming across. It is more\nabout real photography enthousiasts on one side and a general audience on the\nother not really caring about photography. The enthousiasts are willing to\nspend more money on a proper camerasystem, whereas the general audience find\ntheir smartphone good enough.\n\nOMD catered for the High Volume low profit segment. - The general audience -\nThese days it is the 'No Volume, No profit segment'. The segment OMD is in has\nbeen mostly wiped away. It has become nearly non-existent. No message from\nthis company is going to change that.\n\nImho - it is utter incompetence of the management to stick their heads deep\ninto the ground still thinking this segment is going to revive, with a\nmarketing message that doesn't stick. The only people whom remained is their\nfan base. Those are not enough people to make this segment sustainable.

How well do\nyou think an M43 camera for that amount of money will sell?\n\nWe all know the game Fuji is playing with its X100 series. Create a hype and\nartificial shortage and you may be able to end up to such amount. Still I\nthink the actual sales numbers of such cameras is much lower than the hype\nsuggests.\n\nLike\n\n1\n\n14 hours ago*permalink\n\nReport\n\nImpulses\n\nI think Dave had a point, 5+ years ago. Back then there weren't any small or\nflat top FF bodies and small primes and lightweight zooms were scarce; M4/3\nhad a much more tangible portability angle to sell itself on at the time\n(beyond the teles).\n\nThings change tho, Fuji has a full complement of small f2 WR primes which is\nsomething M4/3 never had (you can count them on one hand and have fingers to\nspare), Sony started to take weather sealing more seriously and the number of\nsmall E mount lens options truly exploded over just the last 4 years.\n\nM4/3 can still scale smaller with something like a PEN, GX###, or GM... But\njust like the market that cares about wildlife and outdoors but wants to save\nsome weight, that might be too niche a market. Panasonic seems to have found a\nmore viable niche in video...\n\nLike\n\n16 min agopermalink\n\nReport\n\ndmanthree\n\nYeah, and Panny didn't do itself any favors by using a FF body for the G9 II.\n\nLike\n\n1\n\n13 min agopermalink\n\nReport\n\nImpulses\n\n(cont.) I'm still shooting M4/3 alongside FF, mostly by inertia and because I\nalready own some nice lenses for key use cases like my Oly 75/1.8... If anyone\nasks me for a recommendation tho I'm pointing them to Fuji X, Sony APS-C, or\nSony/Nikon FF. I'm not sure a small but declining fan base will sustain OM.\n\nI honestly hope it does cause the system is far better off with two 1st party\nOEM, but I'm more skeptical than ever. I think there is still value in the\nsystem, but I don't know that they're playing to their strengths or really\nleveraging that. If weather sealing is one of the big selling points then\nwhere are the updated f1.8 w/sealing?\n\nAt least Pana updated the PL25 and the 20/1.4 was a nice addition, but they're\nstill pricey and outside that and the PL9/1.7 there isn't a lot that qualifies\nas small when it comes to sealed primes. The f4 Pro zooms were another nice\nstep but they should've been out years earlier.\n\nLike\n\n11 min ago*permalink\n\nReport\n\nImpulses\n\nThe Oly 8-25/4 is still heavier than the PL8-18 btw, in fact it weighs just\nabout as much as my FF 17-50/4, so if the intent is to sell people on\nlightweight gear then the system isn't cutting it.\n\nThey refreshed the 9-18 but really didn't do anything with it, OTOH take a\nlook at recent APS-C UWA options like the 10-20/4 G and the 10-18/2.8. Why\nwould anyone choose a 9-18 or heavier M4/3 zooms vs those? The 12-45/4 is ok\nbut the Sigma 18-50/2.8 is cheaper, I know 1st party vs 3rd party isn't\nnecessarily fair but it's the reality...\n\nSo nearly no small sealed primes, only relatively heavy UWA zooms, essentially\nit all goes back to the teles. I love my 35-100/2.8 but even M4/3 users don't\nseem that jazzed about older (but still worthy) options like that.\n\nIt's a tough place to be in, specially with no new bodies <$2K in 4-5 years to\ncreate any buzz. I'd buy a new PEN if they graced it with the E-M5/1 III\nsensor tbh, that's a really low bar.\n\nLike\n\n4 min ago*permalink\n\nReport\n\nShow more replies (6) Reply\n\nSamuel Dilworth\n\nJust wanted to mention that I appreciated the fun title of this article.\n\nReply\n\nLike\n\n11\n\n3 days agopermalink\n\nReport\n\nDave Etchells\n\nHah, funny, I didn't even notice it until I saw your comment :-)\n\nLike\n\n1\n\n1 day agopermalink\n\nReport\n\ndmanthree\n\nI still haven't noticed it. ??\n\nLike\n\n23 hours agopermalink\n\nReport\n\nHide replies Reply\n\nTimmi\n\nWell, well..

A big\nfactor in Olympus' unprofitability was that they were spreading themselves and\ntheir sales too thin, with too many models crowding each other, for probably\nnot that many incremental sales between them.\n\nThe E-M1X in my view was an odd one-off that was nonetheless necessary for\nthem to take the leap to AI focusing. The big body is at odds with their\nmaximum-portability selling point, but it let them pack in enough of that-\ngeneration image processing power to implement AI autofocus at a higher level\nthan anyone else had come close to at the time.\n\nThe big body gave the space and thermal budget for two 4-core CPUs, which in\nturn let them implement the AI algorithms on very general-purpose hardware,\nand not be constrained by the design of a specific AI accelerator chip.

Besides the ruggedness\nand weather sealing, this is a huge factor for me: I can carry a system with a\nwhole batch of lenses for probably less than half the weight of an equivalent\nFF one.\n\n(Remember that it's not just the FL difference, but MFT lenses only have to\ncover half the image circle, which further reduces bulk.)\n\nLike\n\n1 day agopermalink\n\nReport\n\ndanart\n\n@twinfighter- point snd shoot is correct.\n\nAs someone that shoots both hi-res FF vs M43 on a daily basis, you are often\nsurprised how little difference there is.

Especially when it\ncomes to hi pixel count and practical output. We have long been at the point\nof diminishing returns.\n\nComparing a 5mp camera to a 10mp you will see a big difference. 20- vs 45mp\nnot so much.

You never look at images from a camera at pixel peeping levels or\nyour nose on the print.\n\nAll this full frame superiority is quite amusing to watch. meanwhile, most of\nthose in that category do not even use 1/100th of their cameras so called\npotential.

Sold the Oly Pro... (kept the\nvenerable 20/1.7) These FF lenses in my Sony kit are remarkably similar in\nsize and were often cheaper, none were more expensive and most have a light\ngathering or IQ/AF advantage: 20/1.8 G, 24/2.8 G, 35/1.4 GM, SY 45/1.8.\n\nIt's really hard to compete with that IMO... Same story for my PL8-18, loved\nit but at a similar size and just a bit more weight I can get a FF UWA zoom\nwith a much broader shooting envelope than an f5.6-8 equivalent... 16-35/4 G,\n16-28/2.8, 17-50/4, etc. (the latter is barely any heavier than the Oly\n8-25/4...).\n\nLike\n\n1 day agopermalink\n\nReport\n\nImpulses\n\n(cont.)\n\nHOWEVER, what FF can't quite compete with is travel/super zooms, pancakes, and\ntele reach. You can pry my Oly 75/1.8 + GM1/GX850 from my cold dead hands\n(cropping the SY 75/1.8 by 2x isn't quite the same, tho close, if it wasn't\nfor the smaller body I'd sacrifice the Oly 75). Still shooting that combo by\nitself and/or alongside my A7R IV, the 35-100/2.8 too.\n\nStuff like Pana's own L 28-200 f4-7.1 and Canon's RF 100-400 f5.6-8 are\nchallenging that notion too tho, bringing M4/3-size and weight zooms to FF\nland by way of slower lenses that are still faster than M4/3 equivalents (who\nwouldn't want a 14-100 f2-3.5?). The Tamron 28-200 f2.8-5.6 isn't any larger\nthan the Oly 12-100/4 either... And it doesn't seem like pancakes move the\nneedle much, as much as I love them myself.\n\nSo in the end the system/format's main advantage does seem to be the teles\nIMO, and that's a niche that may or may not care to compromise for size...\nHopefully it's profitable enough for OM.\n\nLike\n\n1 day ago*permalink\n\nReport\n\nImpulses\n\nAs an aside, I'd argue APS-C has been doing small zooms better than M4/3\nlately, or at least on par but for less of a premium... eg Sigma 18-50/2.8 &\n10-18/2.8 along with the Sony 10-20/4 or 18-135 & 70-350 G. Those UWA the Oly\n9-18 look like a relic, but they aren't any larger, I know some of it is 3rd\nparty vs 1st party but still, it's reality.\n\nThen at the other end of the spectrum you've got Viltrox doing excellent APS-C\nprimes like the 27/1.2 & 75/1.2 for far far less than the price of an Oly Pro\nf1.2 or than the 20/1.4 Pro & PL25/1.4 even. Again, more for less at a similar\nor smaller size is really hard to compete with. Fuji came out with a whole f2\nWR line, M4/3 failed to have any semblance of a full line of small weather\nsealed primes.\n\nIf it weren't for the teles there wouldn't be much left for the system to hang\nit's hat on...

Problem with focusing on wildlife and birding won\u2019t change\nanything. Wildlife and birds are most active in early morning or late evening.\nJust at those times this system doesn\u2019t have its peak performance.\n\nGood for daytime photography, but not good enough during the times that count\nmost. The refusal of not wanting to admit the shortcomings of the system is\nalso the downfall for this system. A renewed strategy and larger sensors are\nimho needed to get OMD/Olympus back on track.\n\nLike\n\n2\n\n5 days agopermalink\n\nReport\n\nCharlesB58\n\nI use m4/3 for concert and theater photography. Very rare. I've spent years\ndeveloping a workflow to reduce noise and deal with the tonality of the 4/3\nsensors. My work sells, but I will readily admit that using FF would make\nthings easier, and get results that look like the standard for concert\nphotography. Which is one reason why i continue to use m4/3: clients care far\nless about noise levels than photographers do, and my images have a different\nlook to them than typical FF concert photos (in part also because a lot of\nconcert photoraphers use the same processing steps to get images that look\nlike the most sucessful concert photographers>\n\nAll this is to agree that trying to promote m4/3 for low light use would be an\nuphill battle, not worth attempting.\n\nLike\n\n4\n\n5 days agopermalink\n\nReport\n\nHide replies Reply\n\njaeae\n\nOlympus has always been a bit unsure who their customers are, and it seems\nstill the same with the new owner..\n\n\"maybe we would collaborate with an image processing software company,\nmaybe..\"\n\nYes, yes, get on with it already!

Olympus was always the odd man out. They didn't\ncollaborate with Adobe like the others. They were secretive about technology.\nProbably understandable since they were a small fish in a large bowl. However,\nthat led to Olympus being a step behind on software, in both the camera, photo\nediting and other ancillary software. I get the feeling things are changing\nwith OMDS. The collaboration with Sigma on the 150-600mm lens, despite the\npredictable criticism, might be a sign of this.\n\nLike\n\n5 days agopermalink\n\nReport\n\nHubertus Bigend\n\nOlympus already collaborated with Sigma back in the Four Thirds DSLR days.
