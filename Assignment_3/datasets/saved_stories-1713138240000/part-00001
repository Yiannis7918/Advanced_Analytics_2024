Marc Baier, Ryan Adams and Daniel Gericke, senior managers\nin the UAE-based company DarkMatter, are accused of violating US export\ncontrol laws in providing the UAE dictatorship with regulated technology and\nservices without a requisite license and with violating a US computer hacking\nlaw. As part of a deferred prosecution agreement with the government, the\nthree will have to forfeit $750,000, $600,000, and $335,000, respectively.\n\nFormer NSA operator and analyst David Evenden worked with the three men in the\nUAE and was among the first US intelligence workers recruited for the job \u2014\nthough he didn\u2019t know it was a surveillance program when he and his wife said\nyes to moving to Abu Dhabi.\n\nIn June 2014, Evenden was finishing his military service and intelligence work\nfor the NSA, when a recruiter contacted him about working for a US-based\ncompany called CyberPoint. The company had a consulting contract with the UAE,\nand Evenden was led to believe the work for the UAE would be entirely\ndefensive in nature, aimed at helping the UAE secure its infrastructure\nagainst attacks from adversarial nations and terrorists.\n\nOnce in Abu Dhabi, Evenden realized he had been deceived and that he and\ncolleagues had actually been recruited to perform offensive hacking operations\nand surveillance on behalf of the UAE\u2019s National Electronic Security\nAuthority, or NESA (the UAE\u2019s equivalent of the NSA).\n\nThe deception didn\u2019t initially concern Evenden, however, because the work was\nprimarily focused on conducting surveillance against would-be terrorist\ntargets. But when his team was asked to help spy on the government of Qatar as\nwell as the movements of the royal family and others with no discernible\nterrorist connection, they began pushing back. The UAE subsequently cancelled\nits contract with CyberPoint and moved the surveillance project \u2014 known as\nProject Raven \u2014 to a UAE-based company called DarkMatter that would be more\namenable to the spying requests. While a number of Evenden\u2019s US colleagues\njumped to DarkMatter to continue the work at considerably higher salaries \u2014 in\nsome cases more than $200,000 for analysts and close to half a million dollars\nfor managers \u2014 Evenden quit and returned to the U.S.\n\nA lot of what DarkMatter was doing in the UAE has already been described in\ndetail in stories published by reporter Jenna McLaughlin in The Intercept and\nForeign Policy in 2016 and 2017, and in 2019 by Reuters' journalists Chris\nBing and Joel Schectman, who obtained extensive internal documents about\nProject Raven and an on-the-record interview with Lori Stroud, another\nAmerican who worked in the program. Stroud and the documents revealed just how\nmuch she and other former US intelligence workers were involved in spying for\nthe UAE. Evenden spoke about his UAE work for an episode of the DarkNet\nDiaries podcast in 2019, and in her recent book, NY Times journalist Nicole\nPerlroth revealed that some of the communications Evenden and his team\nintercepted from Qatar were emails between Qatar\u2019s Sheikha Moza bint Nasser\nand First Lady Michelle Obama about the latter's visit to Qatar.\n\nHere Evenden describes how he was approached by a headhunter in June 2014 to\nwork for CyberPoint and the red flags that he ignored \u2014 including concerns\nabout his manager, Marc Baier, who was charged by the Justice Department. The\ninterview has been edited and organized for length and clarity.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on the charges against Marc brought by the Justice\nDepartment?\n\nI actually feel like ... what they\u2019re doing ultimately is, in my opinion, a\nterrible precedence. Because you just made [hacking] foreign infrastructure\nfrom a foreign location open-season for US citizens. The only thing that\nthey\u2019re charging them with is attacking US infrastructure [not helping the UAE\nspy on other countries].... [L]et\u2019s just say I\u2019m an American and I want to\ntarget something overseas. What\u2019s going to happen to me? Nothing. Almost\nnothing. We just proved that....\n\nHow were you first approached to go to the UAE?\n\n[I]t was a full headhunter....He worked for a third-party recruiting company\nthat was looking for somebody to fulfill billets overseas by CyberPoint.\n\nYou had just left the NSA at that time?\n\nI was still there.... [W]e had decided to leave the military but I had\naccepted another position with a different contracting firm to stay there on\ncampus with the NSA... My EoS (End of Service for the military) was August 3.\nSo...from June 2 [we] started the entire interview process [with the\nheadhunter], and we leave for Abu Dhabi on August 7.\n\nWow. Whirlwind.\n\nI can\u2019t believe we did that. Then August or September, we find out we\u2019re\npregnant [with our first child].\n\n    \n    \n    Evenden and his wife initially lived in a hotel before moving into \u201ca crazy huge villa.\u201d He says about half a dozen other Americans were hired around the same time, which grew to about 35 by the time he quit.\n\nYou\u2019ve said there were no red flags. How did the recruiter convince you to re-\nlocate to Abu Dhabi?\n\nThere were no red flags because I was so naive. But... there\u2019s a ton of red\nflags [in retrospect].... [For example] when you\u2019re in the interview process\nand you\u2019re talking about defending [the UAE] and ... doing tracking of\nterrorist activity,... but then you\u2019re [being asked] very specific questions\nabout integrated enterprise Windows environments and [how you might hack\nthem]. Guess who doesn\u2019t have those type of networks? Terrorist organizations.\nSo why [is the recruiter] asking these kinds of questions...?\n\nSo had I been really cognizant of where or what I was stepping into, I\nprobably would have known during even the interview process that something is\na little bit amiss here.\n\nI can see why you might have thought everything was legit since CyberPoint did\nhave approved contracts with other governments.\n\nRight. We had an official signed export control license from the State\nDepartment. We had ITAR [International Traffic in Arms Regulations]\nauthorities, we had permissions. We had the whole deal to help protect [the\nUAE]. We did not have authorities to help perform offensive operations.\n\nSo you believed the entire mission for CyberPoint in the UAE was defensive.\n\nExactly.\n\nBut when you were interviewed for the job, the interviewer asked you about\noffensive operations.\n\nExactly. And had I been not naive, that would have been much more clear.\n\nDid the contract between the UAE and CyberPoint include offensive operations?\n\n[T]he CyberPoint contract with the UAE, as pertains [to what] the State\nDepartment... authorized, it was defensive. [W]ere we supposed to be\nperforming offensive operations? The answer is no. Was it happening anyways as\nto whether or not we were assisting or performing these actions on our own?\nYes.\n\nYour personal contract was also for defensive work only?\n\nThe way that the CyberPoint contracts were written and what the missions were,\nwere not really clear. I think they were written that way on purpose, though.\n\nBut you thought you were going to help the UAE set up a defensive network.\n\nEveryone did.\n\n    \n    \n    Once he arrived in Abu Dhabi and met with Marc Baier, who had previously worked for the NSA in Hawaii, he says there were more red flags.\n\nI actually, just because of our conversations [with Marc] and the way\neverything was being handled when I first [arrived], I reached out to somebody\nthat I knew that knew Marc previously in the service and just kind of asked,\n\u2018Something seems weird here with this person. What\u2019s going on?\u2019\n\nWhat did Marc say or do that made you think you should ask someone about him?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to answer questions based on intuition... His personality, ... if\nyou ever met him, you would just know immediately like something\u2019s wrong\nhere.... It\u2019s weird that...my spidey sense went off and it was actually so\nincredibly accurate. I probably should have just listened [to it].\n\nDid you think he was deceptive?\n\nOne hundred percent. I mean you can\u2019t have a conversation with him and not\nthink he\u2019s being deceptive. I mean at least at that point.... We weren\u2019t\nallowed to have copies of \u2014 or spend a lot of time reading \u2014 the documents\nfrom the State Department. No one was allowed to have a copy of that.\n\nThe licensing documents?\n\nExactly. So in my mind, it\u2019s like why? Unless what we\u2019re doing here is not\napproved, why else would I not be allowed to have a copy of that?\n\nDid he seem troubled by what they were doing?\n\nI think that he knew what was coming down the road, and he knew what the next\nfive to ten years looks like.\n\nPart of me felt like he was just continually incredibly depressed about the\nprocess, but doing his best. Let\u2019s just say you start a process...and you\u2019re\nthis naive person that wants to help the world and make the world a better\nplace. And now fifteen years later you\u2019re...using [people] for something\ncompletely different than what they think they\u2019re doing. Ultimately I feel\nlike he had a conscience....\n\nThat seems to contradict what the FBI says. The FBI says they were warned as\nearly as 2017 that their activity violated US regulation, and Marc and the\nothers shrugged it off.\n\nI think at that point yes. But what I\u2019m talking about is 2014... when he was\nstill a CyberPoint employee.\n\nSo he was feeling some guilt about not being straight with you guys?\n\nOne hundred percent.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t you leave as soon as you sensed in August that something was off?\n\nThey didn\u2019t really make it easy to just turn around and leave. I think that\nhad it been a lot easier ... it\u2019s possible we might have. Purchasing plane\ntickets, breaking a contract, moving household goods,... the contract says if\nyou don\u2019t do this, you\u2019re going to have to pay for all of this. So it\u2019s like,\nNo I don\u2019t have like $30,000 sitting around just to pay this back. So it\u2019s\nlike I might as well just push through and make it work.\n\nWere there other red flags once you started the work?\n\n[T]here\u2019s just so many things throughout the process that just became very\nclear something is just different here.... [T]he way that information was\ndelivered to us altered \u2014 as a request from the UAE government back down to us\n... filtered through Marc and Ryan. [It] ended up being presented in a way\nthat did meet or align with our authorities, or rather seemed to... Ryan Adams\nwas good at taking stuff and making it sound like it actually did support our\nmissions or what we thought our mission was.\n\n    \n    \n    Evenden says they never did defensive work. Initially, they were tasked with doing open-source intelligence research and analysis aimed at terrorist groups and individuals \u2014 identifying ISIS and al Qaeda movements across borders to help prevent attacks. But it gradually turned into something more. For example, they were asked to see if they could penetrate computers in Qatar to see if the country was funneling money to terrorist organizations. But when they found they could access many government ministry offices and other sensitive networks in Qatar, their UAE overlords wanted more than just terrorist intelligence; they wanted to track the flights that members of the royal family were taking, and they wanted to know if Qatar was bribing officials of FIFA (the Federation Internationale de Football Association) to get the 2022 World Cup hosted in Qatar. CyberPoint\u2019s CEO Karl Gumtow has long insisted that his employees only did defensive work for the UAE and that if anyone engaged in offensive operations, this was rogue activity.\n\nWe would [also] regularly purchase new laptops and install them with malware,\nand [then they would] give them away as gifts \u2014 completely re-package them.\n\nWho were they giving the laptops to?\n\nOther leaders. Leaders who were coming to visit [UAE] sheiks.... We reported\n[to people] two or three steps down from the sheik ... but the only real\npeople who knew who those people were, were Ryan and Marc.\n\nSo Ryan and Marc would task you with outfitting a laptop with spyware and they\nwould pass it to the sheik\u2019s staff, who would give them to foreign\ndignitaries?\n\nYeah. \u201cThanks for coming. Just as a sign of our appreciation, here\u2019s a bunch\nof stuff.\u201d One of those things happened to be a laptop. We do know that they\nwere turned on sometimes. What happened after that we don\u2019t aways know the\nanswers to.\n\nYou know they were turned on because they were beaconing out? But then you\ndidn\u2019t see any other communication after that?\n\nSome situations there were, some situations there weren\u2019t.\n\nDid you feel safe in Abu Dhabi?\n\nI would say from a local crime perspective yes. [Did] I feel safe from the\ncountry that I\u2019m helping?... I think that I continually felt on edge the whole\ntime I was there. It\u2019s just the nature of where you\u2019re at. [Y]ou\u2019re with your\nfamily in a country that\u2019s not very far from very active terrorist activity\nfor one. But from the country itself,... they effectively are watching the\npeople helping and supporting the contract almost continuously.\n\nSo you were under surveillance. At home?\n\nI don\u2019t think at home no, but definitely if you do something different \u2014 if\nyou fly to an adjacent country, if you have friends from out of town, if\nyou\u2019re traveling across borders a lot. Yes there is definitely always people\nwith their eye on you. Also, watching that [surveillance] happening to people\nwho are...targets of our shop and knowing what that looked like \u2014 what they\u2019re\nwilling to do, and what they can get away with in the UAE is frightening.\nThere\u2019s no checks and balances.\n\nWere there enough expats there that you felt comfortable being there?\n\nUltimately that\u2019s what creates this facade of international comfort is that\nthe country is 90 percent expats. We went to church, we were part of a small\ngroup \u2014 in fact some of the people we were friends with there we see regularly\nstill. We developed really strong relationships... So it does kind of give you\nthis almost a false sense of security because you\u2019re incorporated with so many\nother expats.\n\nWhen did it become clear that things were changing in your work?\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until maybe the first quarter of 2015 that we really truly stepped\ninto expanding, or at least participating in expanding, offensive operations\nas it pertains to regional countries... the targeting of foreign countries. It\ndidn\u2019t happen that quickly. It probably went from January to October before\nsome serious suspicions started to get raised. [Though] I would imagine some\nof the other people probably had similar questions and that they were being\nasked and raised before I even thought about them.\n\nYou guys weren't talking about it among yourselves?\n\nWe were some. But we were just pushing it off: \u201cI\u2019m assuming it's approved, so\nit\u2019s probably fine\u201d... until you get other [requests] like flight patterns [of\nthe Qatar royal family], journalist activity, ... then you begin to ask\nquestions like why do you guys want this? And... as soon as those questions\ncame about, that\u2019s when this shift began to happen [the transfer of the\ncontract from CyberPoint to DarkMatter.]\n\n[W]e realized holistically that our shop is actually.... an offensive shop and\npart of NESA. So there wasn\u2019t even a pretense that you were doing defense.\nEverything we were doing is offensive.\n\nWere you talking with Lori Stroud during this time and did she share the same\nconcerns before she took the offer to jump to DarkMatter?\n\nI think Lori was significantly more naive than I was. In fact when we left, I\ntold Lori, \u201c[I]f you stay here, you\u2019re going to struggle and you\u2019re going to\nbe asked to do this stuff.\u201d And she said no, no, no. They've assured me not.\n\u201cLori, you\u2019re going to be asked to do this stuff. There\u2019s logically no other\nreason for them to shift the contract [to DarkMatter].\u201d She didn\u2019t have the\nsame suspicion; at least not for quite a while.\n\n    \n    \n    DarkMatter would go on to spy on Emirati activist Ahmed Mansoor, British journalist Rori Donaghy, and three US journalists who have never been identified, causing Stroud to raise questions and become sidelined by the company. She would eventually provide information to the FBI for their investigation.\n\nWhat was the breaking point for you?\n\nI think when the shift happened over to DarkMatter [in December 2015]....[W]e\nsaid...you\u2019re shifting here and going to work for a foreign intelligence\nservice? They said, no, we\u2019re going to work for this other commercial\ncompany.... Well who owns that?.... That was the breaking point for us.\n\n    \n    \n    DarkMatter was founded by an Emirati named Faisal Al Bannai. Evenden says when he learned in mid-December 2015 that the contract was moving to DarkMatter, he and his wife and child were in the US for the holidays. Evenden decided not to jump to DarkMatter, but he says CyberPoint told him he should tell Baier and Adams that he would stay in Abu Dhabi.\n\nEven though we already made the decision [that] I'm not going to work for\nDarkMatter.... [T]hey said, don\u2019t tell them that yet, just stay on for as long\nas you can. So I went back [to Abu Dhabi without my wife], and everything was\ncompletely fine, until Ryan realized that [my wife] didn\u2019t come back with me\nand it raised all this suspicion.\n\n    \n    \n    Evenden says they accused him of trying to collect intelligence on their activities.\n\n[Ryan asked], Are you staying or are you not? But imagine that 1,000 times\nmore aggressive. A lot of yelling, a lot of screaming... interrogating us\nabout how much information we\u2019ve shared with people....\n\nWere you collecting intelligence on them at that point?\n\nUltimately,... you want to get as much information as you can before you\nleave. So yeah [I wanted information].\n\nI told them we haven\u2019t fully decided [about leaving]. Yeah I lied. At a\ncertain point I finally said yeah this is it. I\u2019ll send my two weeks notice\nfor the contract. They let me finish out the end of that week and then I left\n... January 16. I probably stayed another two weeks [after that to pack up the\nhouse].\n\n    \n    \n    In early 2016, after more than half a dozen CyberPoint employees quit their jobs and returned to the US from the UAE, the FBI contacted them to ask about their activities there and whether their team had targeted Americans or US infrastructure as part of the UAE's spying operations.\n\nIf you found this article useful or interesting, feel free to share it with\nothers.\n\n### Subscribe to Kim\u2019s Substack\n\nBy Kim Zetter \u00b7 Launched 12 hours ago\n\nMy personal Substack\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Former NSA Hacker Describes Being Recruited for UAE Spy Program\n\nzetter.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nNo posts\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Kim Zetter\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
