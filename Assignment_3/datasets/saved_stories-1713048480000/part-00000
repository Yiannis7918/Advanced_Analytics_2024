You aren\u2019t quite a startup anymore, but\nyou\u2019re also definitely not a big company. And given the high rate of growth,\nthe nature of the job changes meaningfully over the course of just a few\nyears. Few companies get to this point, and the time period is relatively\nbrief: the strongest companies go from ~$1-2M ARR to $200M+ in well under ten\nyears.\n\nFrom what I\u2019ve seen, there are a few traits that disproportionately lead to\nstartup scaling success, and I actively think about them when assessing talent\nfor the scaling journey:\n\n  * I look for these traits in people I work for or with\n  * I am wary of them in people I compete against\n  * I wouldn\u2019t invest in someone who didn\u2019t have them\n  * I especially would not promote someone to senior levels who didn\u2019t exhibit them\n\n## They Are Unapologetically Competitive\n\nThe best startup people are highly competitive. They are always aware of their\ncompetitors, and even if they don\u2019t react to the competition, they\u2019re highly\nattuned to the landscape that they operate in. They\u2019re also motivated by\ncompetition \u2013 when they want to win, they want to win. They aren\u2019t necessarily\ncompetitive all the time \u2013 they aren\u2019t stiff-arming their own kids in the\nbackyard. But when they do choose to compete they are savage, and as a result\nthey really only have two modes: not competing, and fighting to the death.\n\nBeing competitive is a prerequisite to scale a company past $200M ARR, and\nthere are big, long-lasting challenges on the journey that can only be\novercome by even longer-lasting competitiveness.\n\nThe first problem is that if you aren\u2019t competitive, you fundamentally aren\u2019t\nready for the dynamics of winning in tech markets. Virtually all markets are\nultimately dominated by just a handful of winners in even the best case. Your\nmoney will be taken out of your hands by others, unless you cut their hands\noff first. This is unpleasant to confront, but inability to confront hard\nmarket truths is often fatal.\n\nThe second is that the impulse to compete outlasts almost all other desires.\nIt\u2019s a lot easier to run out of stuff to buy than it is to quiet the voice\nsaying \u201cyou need to win.\u201d I find that the greatest startup people stay hungry\nfor as long as they have opponents to compete against.\n\nAs a result, these leaders are unapologetic in their competitiveness, because\nthey\u2019re in total zen harmony \u2013 the market demands that they compete like rabid\nwolverines, and that is completely in keeping with their personalities.\n\n## Obsessed With Forward Momentum\n\nThe best startup people I know are excited by small wins. They\u2019re excited\nabout the smallest deal, they\u2019re excited about every renewal, they\u2019re excited\nabout each incremental positive feature. They love big wins but derive\nemotional fuel from the small ones. There are a few reasons why I think this\nis the case.\n\nPeople who have truly driven real wins know that achievement comes from\nthousands of tiny steps. Sure, huge step function improvements are great \u2013 but\nvictory is determined in the trenches with every incremental deal, every small\npolish feature, every rapidly resolved support ticket.\n\nBut people who have only seen wins (but weren\u2019t instrumental to their success)\noften don\u2019t realize this. To them, that great win came from magic:\n\n  * We built a better product\n  * We had the better sales strategy\n  * We had the best brand\n\nIn reality, the great victory came from the momentum of the tiny wins:\n\n  * We built a better product by fine-tuning our engineering hiring, minimizing management whiplash, supporting teams with great designers, and defending a product development process that balanced quality and speed well.\n  * We had the better sales strategy because we rigorously tested our positioning and trained our reps to be able to execute on it flawlessly, and then we fine-tuned our demand gen to maximize leads within our ideal customer profile. We also just worked our butts off and made twice the calls, and our reps (almost) always actually put relevant information into Salesforce, because diligence is part of our culture.\n  * We built the best brand because we have the best customer support, and our product works the way we say it does \u2013 the product of thousands of tiny optimizations. We also have avoided spiking costs like crazy over the years, and have invested in hundreds of cost optimizations to allow us to do so.\n\nThe best startup scalers are single-minded about maintaining momentum, and\ntheir hunger for small wins doesn\u2019t cause them to lose focus on longer term\ngoals. Because they know the road they\u2019re on, they\u2019re comfortable driving in a\nsnowstorm when they can only see five feet ahead.\n\nPeople who are obsessed with forward momentum can also go much further before\nthey get burnt out or give up. The startup journey often doesn\u2019t provide\nanything like a grade at the end of a semester \u2013 this drives many people\ncompletely crazy. If you\u2019re excited by each small win, it\u2019s easier to handle\nputting one foot in front of the other for years.\n\nAnd finally, there\u2019s a certain type of upward-managing, highly corporate\nanimal that is allergic to small wins. The compounding momentum of thousands\nof small wins is what actually leads to a huge outcome over time; but if\nyou\u2019re at a big company that\u2019s not how you get promoted. At a big company, a\nbunch of small wins leaves you forgotten \u2013 what you need are a few very\nvisible wins that can round out a promotion packet. Unsurprisingly, this\ndoesn\u2019t translate to successful scaling.\n\n## Equally Comfortable With Both High and Low Granularity Thinking\n\nThe best startup scalers can bounce between different levels of detail. For\nexample, they can walk into a product review and talk about how the ordering\nof the buttons on your UI is confusing, and then walk into their next meeting\nand talk about the org chart requirements for next year\u2019s business expansion.\nThey have a wide range of competence.\n\nSuccessfully scaling is truly an odyssey. You begin it as a startup, and you\nessentially end it as you become a corporation worth billions of dollars (if\nyou survive). As a result, you need to build and actively use a wide array of\nskillsets. High-level strategy at $1M ARR might consist of a great new product\nthat strengthens your product-market fit; high-level strategy at $100M ARR\nmight mean acquiring a competitor or changing how your team is compensated.\nThe best scalers have the ability to grow with a company and evolve their\nskillsets.\n\nBut it isn\u2019t enough to just have the ability to grow your skills \u2013 you also\nneed to be comfortable using the full range of skills that you learn. There\nare two traps that I see people fall into:\n\n  * People who only want to think about high strategy \u2013 often long-time executives who only ever do multi-year planning, talk about market positioning, departmental reorgs, and future partnerships. They can be strong at strategy while having no idea what sort of customer support issues their company is facing.\n  * Highly detail-oriented subject matter experts who can go miles deep on a problem, but are clueless when they need to look up towards the horizon. They can crack super-hard technical problems, but sometimes have no concept for where their business needs to go in the next 6 months, let alone 6 years.\n\nThe reason that a lot of people focus exclusively on broad strategy or\ntactical details is almost always due to ego:\n\n  * I\u2019m too strategic to deal with the details.\n  * I\u2019m a technical expert, and my details are the most crucial. This can morph into an even more toxic attitude \u2013 the only worthwhile job is what I do.\n\nIn both cases the same theme is mirrored: It\u2019s not my job to span the full\nscope of the business. The best startup people can and must deal with both big\npicture strategy and small picture details. When you see someone who\u2019s a\ndecathlete at all of the skills that go into scaling a startup, it\u2019s a truly\nformidable sight.\n\nFinally, while it\u2019s a prerequisite to be strong in both details and the big\npicture, I\u2019ve found that the best leaders can also pivot extremely quickly\nbetween low- and high-level thinking. Think of someone switching between very\nstrategic and very tactical matters in the course of one conversation, without\ntheir head spinning.\n\n## Takeaways\n\nSome people are born with the traits listed above, and some people aren\u2019t.\nThis is generally fine, because they\u2019re all trainable or testable to at least\nsome degree.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t naturally competitive, keep in mind that your market probably\nwill devolve to winner-take-most, and use that fact to guide your decision-\nmaking. And make sure that you hire people who can bring the competitive\nfervor that you might naturally lack. Test for this by asking about\ncompetitive environments people have worked at in their past \u2013 competitive\npeople are itching to talk about their past battles and you can usually see\nthe bloodlust in their eyes.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t excited about small wins, try to set up internal systems that\ntrack how small wins compound into big ones \u2013 for example, dashboards that\nshow how you\u2019re reducing support tickets or generating more pipeline. And try\nto learn more about the details of different functions \u2013 this often creates a\nmuch deeper appreciation for the small momentum-building plays that make the\nbusiness tick. This trait is hard to test for, but can be trained because it\u2019s\nmore of a habit than a personality trait.\n\nIf you\u2019re having trouble with high or low granularity thinking, realize that\nboth are equally important muscles to build. And never say \u201cthat\u2019s not my\njob.\u201d Test for this trait by discussing a mix of high and low granularity\ntopics in quick succession \u2013 switching altitudes like this makes many people\nvisibly uncomfortable, but the best will thrive because they love the variety\nand mental stimulation.\n\nShare to Twitter , Hacker News , LinkedIn\n\nstartups leadership scaling careers\n\n## Recent Posts\n\n  * ### Have Concerns And Commit 04 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### Advice That I Can't Get Out of My Head 24 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### Getting Things Done In A Chaotic Environment 12 Mar 2024\n\nFor new content, follow us at @staysaasy or subscribe via email.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
