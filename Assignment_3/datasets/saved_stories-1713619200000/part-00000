Pasteurisation also kills the virus.\n\n\"It is important for people to ensure safe food practices, including consuming\nonly pasteurised milk and milk products,\" said Zhang.\n\nFrom 2003 to April 1 this year, the WHO said it had recorded 463 deaths from\n889 human cases across 23 countries, putting the case fatality rate at 52\npercent.\n\nZhang noted that the human cases recorded in Europe and the United States in\nthe past few years -- since the virus surged -- have been mild cases.\n\nSo far, there is no evidence that A(H5N1) is spreading between humans.\n\nAnd Zhang stressed that the A(H5N1) viruses identified in cows and in the\nhuman case in Texas showed no increased adaptation to mammals.\n\nAs for potential vaccines, if required, Zhang said there were some in the\npipeline.\n\n\"Having candidate vaccine viruses ready allows us to be prepared to quickly\nproduce vaccines for humans, if this becomes necessary,\" she said.\n\n\"For this particular H5N1 virus detected in dairy cows, there are a couple of\ncandidate vaccine viruses available.\"\n\n##### Barron's Newsletters\n\n### The Barron's Daily\n\nA morning briefing on what you need to know in the day ahead, including\nexclusive commentary from Barron's and MarketWatch writers.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nYou have been successfully subscribed to The Barron's Daily.
