Renato Grigoli | Apr 2, 2024\n\nWhile editing Thavolia Glymph\u2019s column for this issue, I found myself pausing\nover the word freelancer. It\u2019s a word with a clear medieval connotation\u2014has\nlance, will travel\u2014but subtly different from a knight-errant, which suggests\nthe temporary wandering associated with a noble quest. A freelancer is a\nknight for hire. Its semantic range cannot now be separated from Akira\nKurosawa\u2019s stories of ronin and the Hollywood Western\u2019s gunslinger. Both are\nlinked to medieval knighthood, the former through a false equivalence between\nmedieval Europe and \u201cfeudal\u201d Japan and the latter more explicitly. Take, for\nexample, Paladin, the protagonist of the television series Have Gun\u2014Will\nTravel (1957\u201363). Paladin, from the Latin palatinus, \u201cof the palace,\u201d\nliterally means \u201cknight,\u201d though it\u2019s taken on more of a flavor of \u201crighteous\nhero.\u201d The word freelancer thus suggests an antiquity to contract labor, as\nwell as a nobility. Sir DoorDasher, if you will.\n\nThere\u2019s only the usual problem: freelancer was coined by Sir Walter Scott,\nfirst appearing in Ivanhoe (1820). For those of us who study the 19th-century\nreception of the Middle Ages, this discovery elicits not surprise but a rueful\nchuckle. Scott\u2019s depiction of the medieval is supposedly responsible for\neverything from the modern Renaissance faire (when his contemporaries\nenthusiastically re-created Ivanhoe\u2019s depiction of a medieval tournament) to\nthe self-conceptions of Southern gentry in the United States (at least\naccording to Mark Twain, who subsequently went to war with the Romantic memory\nof the medieval). In fact, there\u2019s no good culturally equivalent term in\npremodernity. The closest medieval version of the freelancer was perhaps the\ncondottieri of the Italian city-states, but these were, as their name\nsuggests, contracted mercenary bands (condotta means \u201ccontract\u201d). That term\ndescribes a collective and still carries a very medieval sense of mutual\nobligation. It has little relationship to individuals working odd jobs.\nFreelancing is a word created in a capitalist, industrializing era to describe\na capitalist, industrial approach to labor. It is neither ancient nor\nparticularly noble; it has no actual association with any knightly practice.\n\nPeople often like to believe that identities with which they associate are\nolder than they generally are. I have written about the 19th-century desire to\nestablish\u2014via academic arguments, folklore, and monumental architecture\u2014a pre-\nColumbian European history in North America. Most of these efforts are ill-\ndisguised racism. The insistence that Vikings discovered Massachusetts Bay, or\neven more southern parts of the Atlantic coast, was in large part due to the\ndisquiet over the fact that Christopher Columbus was, by 19th-century\nstandards, not white. But some of the insistence that things have more of a\ndepth to their history than they actually do is an attempt to give the United\nStates the authorizing length and richness of history enjoyed by European\nstates.\n\nBut although it fits into the usual pattern, the popular adoption of\nfreelancer is something unusual: it makes a labor model older than it seems\nthrough its relationship to the medieval. When it comes to economics and\npolitical systems, the premodern is much more typically seen as reviled past\nrather than hallowed origin. There is a strong argument that the very idea of\na \u201cfeudal system\u201d in the Anglophone world stemmed from attempts in the 17th\ncentury to differentiate parliamentary democracy and nascent capitalist labor\npractices from royal absolutism and serfdom.\n\nIn popular media, the Middle Ages are poorly understood and often conflated\nwith the fantastic. As such, they make an excellent, fact-free medium for\nexploring and defining one\u2019s own identity. This is how white supremacists\ncould unironically carry the flag of a Black saint to riot in Charlottesville\nin 2017; it\u2019s also one of the reasons why Dungeons and Dragons is popular in\nLGBTQ+ spaces. Romanticism has always been a means to escape the modern. It is\nnot surprising that those being ground to dust under the iron heel of\nexploitative hedge funds and the gig economy might want to find something\nnoble and ancient in their day-to-day experience of late-stage capitalism.\n\nL.
