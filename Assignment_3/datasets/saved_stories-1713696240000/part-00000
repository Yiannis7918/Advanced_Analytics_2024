Philbrick Researches (GAP-R). GAP-R pioneered the\nfirst reasonable-cost, mass-produced operational amplifier (op-amp), the K2-W.\nAt GAP-R, Pease developed many high-performance op-amps, built with discrete\nsolid-state components.\n\nIn 1976, Pease moved to National Semiconductor Corporation (NSC) as a Design\nand Applications Engineer, where he began designing analog monolithic ICs, as\nwell as design reference circuits using these devices. He had advanced to\nStaff Engineer by the time of his departure in 2009.^[7]^[8] During his tenure\nat NSC, he began writing a popular continuing monthly column called \"Pease\nPorridge\" in Electronic Design about his experiences in the world of\nelectronic design and application.^[9]\n\nThe last project Pease worked on was the THOR-LVX^[10]^[11]^[12]^[13] (photo-\nnuclear) microtron Advanced Explosives contraband Detection System: \"A Dual-\nPurpose Ion-Accelerator for Nuclear-Reaction-Based Explosives-and SNM-\nDetection in Massive Cargo\".^[14]^[15]^[16]^[17]^[18]\n\nPease was the author of eight books, including Troubleshooting Analog\nCircuits, and he held 21 patents.^[19] Although his name was listed as \"Robert\nA. Pease\" in formal documents, he preferred to be called \"Bob Pease\" or to use\nhis initials \"RAP\" in his magazine columns.\n\nHis other interests included hiking and biking in remote places, and working\non his old Volkswagen Beetle, which he often mentioned in his columns.^[20]\nPease's writing was \"strongly opinionated, but he could communicate with a wry\nsense of humor that endeared him to readers whether they agreed with him or\nnot\".^[1]^[21]^[22]\n\n> My favorite programming language is ... solder.^[6]\n\n## Death[edit]\n\nFlag at half-staff at National Semiconductor on June 21, 2011\n\nPease was killed in the crash of his 1969 Volkswagen Beetle, on June 18,\n2011.^[23]^[24]^[25] He was leaving a gathering in memory of Jim Williams, who\nwas another well-known analog circuit designer, a technical author, and a\nrenowned staff engineer working at Linear Technology. Pease was 70 years old,\nand was survived by his wife, two sons, and three grandchildren.^[25] The\nsudden death of Pease triggered a small flood of remembrances and tributes\nfrom fellow technical writers, practicing engineers, and electronics hardware\nhacking enthusiasts.^[21]^[23]^[26]^[27]^[16]^[28]^[29]\n\n> Bob was notorious for his design chops, but also for his messy office. Below\n> is one of his early offices at National, where he won a contest from a\n> newspaper for messiest desk. Nancy (his wife) recollects, \u201cIt was a San Jose\n> Mercury News messiest desk contest. Someone entered a picture of his office\n> on his behalf, and asked him if he won a big prize would he share it. Bob\n> didn\u2019t know what the prize was at the time. The competition was in no way up\n> to his entry, so they gave him 1st, 2nd, and 3rd prizes. The prize was for\n> office furniture. Bob sold it to National and threw a pizza party with the\n> money.\u201d^[28]\n\n## Publications (partial)[edit]\n\nBooks\n\n  * Pease, Robert A. (1993). Troubleshooting analog circuits.

He also designed a seismic pre-amplifier chip used to measure lunar ground tremors in the U.S. Apollo moon landing missions. Among his more memorable designs are the LM331 voltage-to-frequency converter and the LM337 adjustable voltage regulator....Pease's reputation grew as he shared the secrets of analog design with engineers around the world through National's Analog Seminars. His passion for sharing information knew no bounds. He worked long hours, answering phone calls and emails from anyone with questions about analog design: customer, student, veteran engineer \u2013 it didn't matter....National Fellow Dennis Monticelli remembers Pease as a helpful colleague and friend. \"We go way back to my days as a green engineer when his gregarious personality and sheer knowledge drew me in.
