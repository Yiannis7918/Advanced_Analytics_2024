It authenticates\ncommunicating parties by using the OPAQUE cryptographic protocol.\n\n## How It Works\n\nEvery shared password has a Lookup ID and a single-use PIN. These must be\ncommunicated to the recipient by email or IM.\n\nThink of the PIN as a debit card ATM PIN. A thief would have only three\nattempts to guess it until he is locked out.\n\n## Example\n\n##### Step 1\n\n  * Alice wants to send a password Qwerty123 to Bob.\n\n  * She creates a password share in Crosspass and receives a Lookup ID of YNMK and a PIN of 9038.\n\n##### Step 2\n\n  * The password has not been sent to a server but remains on Alice\u2019s phone only.\n\n  * She must keep her phone online for Bob to retrieve the password.\n\n##### Step 3\n\n  * She emails YNMK 9038 to Bob and he enters it into his Crosspass app.\n\n  * His phone retrieves the password Qwerty123 from her phone, encrypted end to end.\n\n##### Step 4\n\n  * The password gets deleted from Alice\u2019s phone.\n\n  * The password remains on Bob\u2019s phone for a day.\n\n## Features\n\n### End-to-end encryption\n\nOne end is the sender\u2019s mobile phone, and the other end is the recipient\u2019s\nmobile phone.\n\nThe encryption scheme is based on the OPAQUE protocol. See the white paper for\ndetails.\n\n### Text notes\n\nWhen you need to send more than just a password, use the text note option. For\ninstance, use it for sending credit cards or bank account information.\n\n### Brute force attacks\n\nThe API server does not keep any hashed passwords and the app limits attempts\nto retrieve the password. Therefore, a MITM could not brute-force the PIN.\n\n### Impersonation attacks\n\nThe app does not rely on receiving a recipient\u2019s public key from the server.\nTherefore, a MITM who does not know the PIN cannot impersonate the recipient.\n\n### Free to receive\n\nIt is always free to receive the passwords and notes which you send, so that\nthe process has no barriers for your recipients.\n\nYou can send three passwords for free. After that there is a one-time fee of\n$1 to continue sending.\n\n### Anonymity\n\nCrosspass does not ask users for their phone numbers or email addresses.\n\nCrosspass uses Push Notifications and has in-app purchases via App Store on\niOS and Google Play on Android.\n\n## Not Only for Passwords\n\nSocial Security numbers\n\nPGP fingerprints\n\nAPI credentials\n\nCredit card numbers\n\nBank account numbers\n\nDriving License numbers\n\nSocial Security numbers\n\nPGP fingerprints\n\nAPI credentials\n\nCredit card numbers\n\nBank account numbers\n\nDriving License numbers\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n  * Why would I ever need to share my own password?\n\nExamples:\n\n    * Encrypt a ZIP file and send the password by Crosspass\n    * Send your gate code to your AirBnb cleaner\n    * Let your mom watch your Netflix\n    * Send a password or an API token to your client\n    * Access the same encrypted drive (Veracrypt, BitLocker, DMG, Cryptomator)\n\nMore use cases\n\n  * Why should I trust Crosspass?\n\nYour secrets are stored on your mobile phone and are shared in encrypted form.\n\n    * The Crosspass server never sees your passwords or private notes.\n    * It relays blobs of data between two phones, but it cannot decrypt them.\n    * It does not hold any encryption keys of users (no public, private, symmetric, or Diffie-Hellman shares).\n\nIf the Crosspass server is compromised, the perpetrator must guess an\nequivalent of 11 coin flips in sequence in order to MITM a single exchange.\nOther server-based encryption apps can MITM without difficulty by giving out\nrogue cryptographic keys.\n\nLearn more\n\n  * What happens if the PIN is intercepted?\n\nWhoever gets to use the PIN first is the winner. However, a theft would be\nhard to conceal. If a thief uses the PIN first but cannot be a MITM, then the\nreal recipient will complain to the sender that he cannot access the share.\n(The share can be accessed only once.)\n\nLearn more\n\n  * Do I need to send the PIN by another channel?\n\nYou can send both the Lookup ID and PIN together. However, if you are\ncommunicating over an insecure channel and you need to refer to the share\nwithout mentioning the PIN, then you can refer to it by the Lookup ID.\n\nLearn more\n\n  * Why not use Signal or WhatsApp to send a password?\n\nFirst, the sender cannot compose a message by IM unless the recipient already\nhas the same IM and the sender knows recipient\u2019s phone number.\n\nSecond, the Signal server keeps track of \u201cwho is who,\u201d namely it proxies\npublic keys and Diffie-Hellman shares. Therefore, the server can MITM any\nconversation. Preventing this requires verifying \u201cSafety Numbers\u201d, which are\n60 digits long, before texting. Use Crosspass to exchange and verify them\nconveniently.\n\nDitto for WhatsApp where the \u201cSafety Numbers\u201d are called \u201cSecurity Code\u201d.\n\nLearn more\n\n  * Why not share a password via a Password Manager?\n\nIf they rely on asymmetric encryption, then they have the same MITM issue as\nSignal and WhatsApp.\n\nIf they rely on symmetric encryption, then the password manager stores a first\npart of cryptographic data on the server and a second part in a shared code or\nweb link. However, the assumption is that no thief can collect these two\nparts, neither immediately nor at any future time. But this cannot be\nguarranteed because no one can guarrantee the deletion of data.\n\nLearn more\n\n  * Why not use PGP to share a password?\n\nThere are usability problems with PGP which is the reason for its small\nadoption since it was invented in 1991. However, if you already use PGP with\nsuccess, then you can still benefit from using Crosspass to exchange PGP\npublic keys or fingerprints.\n\nLearn more\n\n  * What information is observed on the Crosspass API server?\n\nFrom the perspective of the Crosspass server the user is anonymous. Only Apple\nor Google can map the collected information to the identity of the owner of\nthe iOS or Android device respectively.\n\nThe Crosspass API server observes the following information:\n\n    * Device ID of the sender\u2019s device.\n    * IP addresses of both sender and recipient.\n    * The date and time when requests are made.\n    * App Store or Play Store payment receipt of the sender.\n    * Device Check (for iOS only).\n    * Attestation that the requests to the server originate from authentic Crosspass app running on a real device.\n\n  * What information is stored on the device?\n\nThe Crosspass app stores the following on the device:\n\n    * The outbound password is stored on sender\u2019s device until it is retrieved by recipient. Then it is deleted on the sender\u2019s device.\n\n    * Cryptographic keys that can decode ciphertext are stored on the sender\u2019s device until the password is retrieved by the recipient. Then all cryptographic keys pertaining to this password are deleted on the sender\u2019s device.\n\n    * If the recipient has not retrieved the password, the password will remain on the sender\u2019s device for two weeks, then will be deleted.\n\n    * Received password is stored on the recipient\u2019s device for 24 hours, then it is deleted.\n\nNote that data on either device is not backed up in iCloud.\n\n  * Can I use Crosspass on Desktop or Web?\n\nThe short answer is no, however a desktop version is planned in the future.\nUntil then, use Crosspass in conjunction with a password manager to copy-paste\ntext between your desktop and your phone.\n\nCommunication web apps by their nature are subject to JavaScript Backdoor\nattacks, thus they cannot provide an end-to-end encryption guarantee. For this\nreason a web app for Crosspass will not be available.\n\n  * Can I share files with Crosspass?\n\nCrosspass is designed to complement existing workflows. For example, use\nWinZip to create an AES-encrypted ZIP archive and transfer it by Dropbox.\nThen, use Crosspass to send the encryption password.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2022 Entelecheia Inc.
