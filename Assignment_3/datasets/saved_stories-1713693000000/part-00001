That\u2019s not what I do.\n  * Most people in tech work on one specific digital product like Google Maps, for example. I work for an agency which means I work on the agency\u2019s client projects.\n  * On average (sometimes more, rarely less), I work on 5 projects per week/at a time.\n  * Some client projects have a clear finish line like the new website is live. Other projects (also called retainers) are ongoing and include yearly roadmaps and agile sprints and retros.\n  * My title includes the word \u201clead\u201d but I don\u2019t have people management duties. I\u2019m also not interested in a people manager role.\n\nIt is pretty funny. I do enjoy flexing my content design muscles by changing\nmy explanation based on my audience and their level of tech savviness. I\u2019m 99%\nsure my grandmother still thinks I\u2019m a psychologist. Plot twist: I was never a\npsychologist.\n\n> *me to a close lifelong friend*: how\u2019s your job and also what is it\n>\n> \u2014 avi steinbach (@Muscles__McGee) October 22, 2021\n\nIn the past few months, you might\u2019ve noticed I\u2019ve written a bunch of articles\non content design/my day-to-day work. Sure, I did this for my professional\ngrowth, but also because I want my friends and family to actually know what I\ndo (if they want to).\n\nSo, today, I\u2019d like to share a day in my life as an agency content designer.\n\n## Day in the life\n\nI wake up around 8.30am. I leave work at 8pm at the latest. Since we all work\nremotely and are in different time zones, leaving work means I\u2019ve outlined my\nworking hours in Google Calendar and Slack. Obviously, I prefer not to have\nlate meetings, but I try to remain flexible and will join calls past 8pm if\nthat\u2019s the only time that works for the client or the rest of the team. I ran\na 10.30pm-12.30am workshop late last year with a group of physicians that had\nunderstandably tricky schedules, but at least I only had to run the first\nportion of the workshop and at the risk of stating the obvious, I didn\u2019t have\nto join.\n\nOriginally, I\u2019m an early bird, but working for an American company from\nAustria (6-8h time difference), I realized way, way later than I should have\nthat:\n\n  * honoring my body\u2019s cycles by waking up early, starting work at 8am and\n  * working until 8pm so that I could have a large overlap with the US team\n\nwouldn\u2019t work in the long term. For the past year or so, I\u2019ve started work\naround 11am and closed my laptop at 8pm... just to open it a few minutes later\nto watch The Office, New Girl, Sopranos, or The Bear (currently watching,\n10/10 so far, no spoilers please). These new work hours have worked way better\nfor my mental health, energy levels, and relationships.\n\nThis also means I can work out in the morning, run errands, talk to friends\nwho also work remotely, and find the cutest libraries (see: featured image) or\ncoffee shops to work from.\n\n## Projects I worked on\n\nFYI: Some days I have no meetings, some days I have 7. Some weeks I work on 4\nprojects, some weeks I work on 6. I picked a random February Tuesday. I\nbelieve it\u2019s an accurate depiction of most of my \u201ca day in my life.\u201d\n\n  1. defined new editorial workflows for a college\u2019s internal content request/submission process. Here\u2019s the rough agenda I put together for the client call:\n\n     * Discuss previously identified editorial pain points\n     * Review workflow recommendations solving for those pain points identified in a previous workshop (like staff members having to manually review and update copy despite it coming from vetted sources or not having a way to periodically review and audit time-sensitive info like deadlines or people retiring)\n     * Confirm new roles and permissions of people who will be involved in content creation or curation moving forward\n  2. finalized sitemap and content model updates for a university\u2019s website and for their lab services website\n\n     * A colleague and I had presented both to the client. For revisions, we were relying on async communication. I had received the client\u2019s second round of feedback, made updates (or asked questions/probed further if necessary) to both sitemaps and content models, and sent the revised versions to them.\n  3. rehearsed with the internal team the IA presentation for a company offering versatile and reliable fasteners. This is also known in the vast world of American acronyms as dry run. Here\u2019s the rough agenda I put together for the client call:\n\n     * 10min / Defining terms -Let\u2019s build a shared understanding of the artifacts we\u2019ll be reviewing today.\n     * 10min / Current state and future experience strategy\n     * 30min / Sitemap \u2013 We\u2019ll discuss how we envision the new navigation being organized to help users fulfill their key tasks.\n     * 10min / Next steps\n  4. content audit for a leading provider of inpatient rehabilitation for stroke, brain injuries, and other conditions. I analyzed a few metrics in the content audit to measure content effectiveness including:\n\n     * word count\n     * title & title length\n     * usage of alternative text\n     * readability score\n     * link text \u2013 The term \u201clink text\u201d refers to the text used to link to a specific webpage or document. I suggested rewriting link text so that it describes the content of the link target. Avoid using ambiguous link text, such as \u2018click here\u2019 or \u2018read more\u2019 or single words like nuts or choice. Yes, I\u2019m pulling from the audit verbatim.\n  5. met with the internal team to finalize next steps for gated content strategy for a major consumer (and B2B) electronics corporation. I\u2019d be presenting findings, recommendations, and estimates to the client team in the next client call.\n\nI had 2 other meetings this day besides the ones mentioned in #3 and #5:\n\n  * a status call with the internal team working on the college website rebuild project mentioned on #1\n  * a virtual hangout with my best friend who lives in the Netherlands before starting work (prioritize your relationships!!!)\n\nLooking at photos from this day, I\u2019m reminded that I worked from the library.\nWhen I arrived at the station, I saw that the train to get to the library was\na few minutes away so I stood outside enjoying the sun. On the way there, I\nread Factfulness: Ten Reasons We\u2019re Wrong About the World \u2014 and Why Things Are\nBetter Than You Think. For lunch, I had stuffed peppers. I was going through a\nbolgur phase.\n\nI also completed a peer review. Not on this day, but generally, I also work on\ninternal stuff to advance the content design discipline within the company.\nThis may look like running a content crit during weekly content design team\nsyncs, rethinking and rewriting how we talk about our deliverables on the\ninternal documentation site, auditing tools/processes, being part of a product\n& design integration committee (did I mention we\u2019re going through a merger?).\n\nAs an agency content designer, there\u2019s plenty of variety in my days: different\nindustries, different teams, different deliverables / types of projects.\n\nHowever, a lot is missing from the lists above, namely questioning myself,\nfrantically searching online, feeling stuck and overwhelmed and anxious and\nlike I\u2019m failing (not to mention all the days that I can\u2019t get anything done\nbecause I feel so burnt out). These are difficult feelings to deal with in the\nmoment, but on most days once I\u2019m done with work, I can appreciate all of this\nfor what it is: part of the process. Basically, I oscillate between these two\nmoods.\n\nIf my meetings end earlier in the day, I\u2019ll go on a walk with my partner\naround the large body of water near our house which might end up in a little\ncoffee little cake reading session at a lovely cafe that stays open \u201clate\u201d\n(most coffeeshops in Vienna close at 6.30).\n\nIf my meetings end later than 8pm, I\u2019ll treat myself with pizza and 2\nnegronis.\n\n## What I wish I had known when I started\n\nFirstly, I have to mention that my current role has provided incredible\nopportunities for me so far. Juicy (I refuse to say meaty) problems, a lot of\nresources at my disposal (hello $3000 yearly professional development budget),\ndeep learning about many industries, a seat at every table as a content\ndesigner (no \u201csprinkling copy magic\u201d here) focused on high impact and high\nvisibility work, some of the smartest and kindest people I\u2019ve worked with, and\nopportunities to start over and do things differently on every new project.\nThis isn\u2019t the point of this article, but I\u2019d be remiss not to mention the\ngratitude (dare I say, love?) I feel for 10up specifically and agency life\ngenerally.\n\nA healthy baseline optimism is the general level of optimism you\u2019ve built and\nthat you maintain even at times when things are kinda shitty for you. I\u2019ve\nwritten about some of my healthy baseline optimism activities. They include\nmeditation, working out, writing.\n\nIt\u2019s important to build a healthy level of baseline optimism regardless of\nwhere you work, but it\u2019s especially important when you work at an agency and\nyou\u2019re constantly in a busy period.\n\nMany people have written about the pros and cons of in-house vs agency work.\nWhether agency is right for you depends on where you\u2019re at with your career,\npersonal life, how you deal with context switching, and generally how much you\ncare or let work affect you. It\u2019s okay to not care about work, but you need to\nknow what you\u2019re signing up for.\n\n  * My first full-time job: Content Strategist at an online food ordering and delivery platform launched in 2015 in Albania.\n  * Second full-time job: Content Strategist at the first Albanian native advertising platform.\n  * Third full-time job before the one I\u2019ve been at for the past 2.5 years: Content Strategist at the largest and oldest Albanian C2C platform (think Craigslist).\n\nEach of these companies also had a web agency. The agency was the main source\nof income for some, for others, the agency had become obsolete since the\nactual product took off. These side hustle agencies had somehow prepared me\nfor my current role at a world-class agency, but also, not really. Each agency\nis different and you\u2019ll benefit more from refining your skills rather than\nfocusing on how each agency works, aka learning coping mechanisms rather than\nskills.\n\nIn 5 Signs It\u2019s Time to Quit Your Job, Cate Huston\u2019s fantastic article that\nI\u2019ve probably mentioned to 10 people at this point including my therapist, she\ncalls out \u201cYou\u2019re learning coping mechanisms rather than skills\u201d as a sign.\n\n> \u201cEvery organization has their quirks that people find their way to work\n> around. Perhaps the reporting is a little overly arduous, or your manager\u2019s\n> manager a little political, or the culture a little too argumentative for\n> your liking. Over time, we learn to cope with these things \u2013 we set aside\n> extra time for the reports, make sure we take the time to sell the political\n> person on our ideas, or learn how to argue.\n>\n> The trap: Sometimes organizations are (or become) sufficiently toxic that\n> we\u2019re investing more time in developing and refining the coping mechanisms\n> than the actual skills. If your list of things to develop is really a list\n> of things that you won\u2019t have to do in a more functional environment, none\n> of which will make you more employable elsewhere... it\u2019s time to walk away.\n> The coping mechanisms trap is particularly vicious because in a healthy\n> environment, coping mechanisms will often be harmful. The more time you\n> invest in refining them, the more time you\u2019re going to have to spend\n> untangling them in a healthy environment \u2013 if you ever make it to one.\u201d\n\nTanya Reilly put together this 5 Signals Rubric: template (screenshot below)\nbased on Cate\u2019s article. \u201cMake a copy of this template. Set a regular reminder\nto re-read this article by Cate Huston and update your metrics. We all have\ngood weeks and bad weeks. Instead of reacting to what\u2019s happening right now,\ntrack how your signals are trending over time.\u201d\n\n## This content design job requirement is pretty ridiculous\n\nWorking in an agency isn\u2019t easy. You\u2019re quasi-forced to be organized, manage\nmultiple workstreams and deadlines simultaneously, communicate clearly and\noften, present to execs, have above-average note taking or memory skills, and\nlearn new industries constantly.\n\nFasteners? Medical simulation? Clinical trials? Law publications? Electronics?\nAll of it!\n\nGoogle\u2019s content design job postings include \u201c2 years of writing, editorial,\nmarketing, or UX writing experience in an agency setting\u201d under preferred\nqualifications.\n\nI roll my eyes whenever I see hiring managers disregard web design agency\nexperience and ask exclusively for product experience. Content design skills\nare transferable whether you\u2019re working for clients or internal stakeholders\nand whether you\u2019re working on flyers, websites, or mobile apps. Implying\notherwise suggests a misunderstanding of the content design craft, what we do,\nand how flexible we are. Not to mention that that Sarah Winters created\n\u201ccontent design\u201d while working on GOV.UK (spoiler: it\u2019s a website).\n\n> \u201cBetween 2010 and 2014, Sarah Winters and her team at the United Kingdom\u2019s\n> Government Digital Service did what many thought impossible: they took over\n> 400 separate government websites and transformed them into a single site\n> designed to effectively serve its users. In doing so, they codified a new\n> discipline: content design.\u201d\n\n## Chickpeas and job descriptions\n\nFun fact: the Albanian equivalent of looking for a needle in a haystack is\nasking for chickpeas in a rotisserie grill. This makes us sound way more\nvegetarian-friendly than we really are which I like. So what does a good job\ndescription look like, one that\u2019s not looking for chickpeas in a rotisserie\ngrill?\n\nI like Google\u2019s content design job descriptions. The first thing you see when\nyou land on the page are minimum and preferred qualifications. They only ask\nfor 4 \u201chard\u201d requirements, all of which sound reasonable to me (yes, including\nproduct writing experience, as long as it\u2019s not the first or only thing you\u2019re\nlooking for). Nice-to-haves are clearly labeled as such. As you scroll down\nthe page, there\u2019s an About the job section (4 paragraphs) and a\nResponsiblities section (5 bullet points). The location requirement and Apply\nbutton are impossible to miss. There\u2019s a salary range. Okay I like it,\nPicasso. Did a content designer put this together?!\n\nIt should say Experience in UX-focused product writing instead of Experience\non UX-focused product writing, but hey, we\u2019re focusing on the most impactful\nwork, not obsessing over copy edits.\n\n## Minimum qualifications\n\n  * Bachelor\u2019s degree in English, Journalism, Communication, Literature, Business, Marketing, a related field, or equivalent practical experience.\n  * 2 years of experience in writing, editorial, marketing, UX writing, or related, as well as leading content strategy projects.\n  * Experience on UX-focused product writing and shaping content for multi-disciplinary projects.\n  * Portfolio highlighting UX-focused writing samples and style guidelines.\n\n## Preferred qualifications\n\n  * 3 years of experience interacting with executive leadership.\n  * 2 years of writing, editorial, marketing, or UX writing experience in an agency setting.\n  * 2 years of experience working in a complex, cross-functional technology organization.\n  * Experience developing information architecture for complex documentation sets or product suites, including localization and accessibility best practices.\n  * Knowledge of online technology and related products, including web and mobile UI and tools.\n  * Familiarity with user experience research principles and practices and how to use data to provide informed user insights.\n\n### Parting thoughts\n\n6 months ago, I came across this post by Kristina Halvorson and felt seen.\nKristina\u2019s an industry leader, someone I deeply respect, and is not\ninconsequential in many of us having jobs in the first place.\n\nI used to never write about content design stuff, but I told myself I only had\nto write 6 articles, and sat down with pen and paper to plan it all.\n\n56 hours = 8h/piece 48h left 4h a week = 12 weeks = 3 months = deadlines,\nSunday, March 31, 2024\n\nI always thought I\u2019d go back to this post which I reposted back then with the\nemoji and publicly thank Kristina once I was done.\n\nWhat happens next will shock you. lol.\n\nBefore I had a chance to thank her, she found and reshared one of my articles,\nsaying:\n\n> I LOVE THIS POST. Truly. This substantive, how-to article by Delfina Hoxha\n> is a fantastic example of how to share your work. You can do it! Be like\n> Delfina!\n\nThis is my last (6 out of 6, baby) content design article for a while. A looot\nof good things happened during these 2 months (more on that another time?).\nThank you Kristina for inspiring me to share my work.
