P. C.\n\nAmazon Web Services\u2019 Virtual Private Cloud is often the first real hurdle for\ndevelopers and others looking to understand cloud systems. I know it was for\nme; I\u2019d not had much networking experience when I first encountered it. To\nreally grok VPC, you need to have at least a mild understanding of network\narchitecture, including subnets and gateways. In my experience, such knowledge\nisn\u2019t par for the course with software developers.\n\nMost software developers can quickly understand EC2 (oh, a virtual machine)\nand S3 (ah, a gigantic disk drive). However, VPC\u2019s networking abstractions are\ntougher. However, VPC is magic.\n\nLet\u2019s talk a bit more about this. AWS built a performant software defined\nnetworking layer. But they didn\u2019t just port all the concepts from the physical\nworld into the cloud. At least, when I read the Unix and Linux Sysadmin\u2019s\nGuide, which dives deep into such things, that\u2019s how it looks to me.\n\nInstead, AWS followed the 80/20 rule, giving developers and architects\nflexibility to build real network architectures. These architectures can\nsupport real world applications, with real world security needs and compliance\nconcerns.\n\nYes, you can also achieve such separation using different AWS constructs (and\nshould!). IAM and Organizations spring to mind. But for many, making sure that\nthey could easily port their current security posture to AWS made a cloud\ntransition easier.\n\nVPC simplifies the networking layer enough that even developers with little\nnetworking experience can understand it (like me!). AWS has even provided\nnetwork logging so that, should you need to delve deep into your networking\nlayer for troubleshooting or auditing, you can.\n\nVPC is also fundamental to other services. EC2 instances are still the\nmajority of AWS budgets, according to Corey Quinn\u2019s 2020 Re:Invent rebuttal.\n\nVPCs are where those \u201cmachines\u201d exist. The fancy managed services AWS wants\nyou to use so they can lock you in? Often they are accessed by dropping ENIs\ninto your VPC.\n\nIf not, these services are running in VPCs managed by AWS, therefore\ninaccessible to you except through tightly managed interfaces. See, the\nsecurity works!\n\nTo top it all off, VPC is free and ubiquitous.\n\nAWS\u2019s VPC is the water to cloud engineers\u2019 fish; we don\u2019t even see it, let\nalone appreciate it.\n\nAWS |
