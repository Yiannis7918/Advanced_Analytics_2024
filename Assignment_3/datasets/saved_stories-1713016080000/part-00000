But how do we detect them, given that\n> experts have blind spots and may not realize the myriad ways in which\n> students can misunderstand programs? Furthermore, once identified, what can\n> we do to correct them?\n>\n> In this paper, we present a curated list of misconceptions, and an\n> instrument to detect them. These are distilled from student work over\n> several years and match and extend prior research. We also present an\n> automated, self-guided tutoring system. The tutor builds on strategies in\n> the education literature and is explicitly designed around identifying and\n> correcting misconceptions.\n>\n> We have tested the tutor in multiple settings. Our data consistently show\n> that (a) the misconceptions we tackle are widespread, and (b) the tutor\n> appears to improve understanding.\n\n#### Paper\n\nPDF\n\nThese papers may differ in formatting from the versions that appear in print.\nThey are made available only to support the rapid dissemination of results;\nthe printed versions, not these, should be considered definitive.
