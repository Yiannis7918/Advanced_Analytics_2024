I. Rosenbaum\n\nIllustration by The Atlantic. Source: Arturo Holmes / Getty.\n\nApril 7, 2024, 7 AM ET\n\nUntil recently, in all of human history, the number of true cyborgs stood at\nabout 70. Ian Burkhart has kept a count because he was one of them\u2014a person\nwhose brain has been connected directly to a computer.\n\nBurkhart had become quadriplegic in a swimming accident after a wave ran him\ninto a sandbar and injured his spine. He was later able to receive an implant\nfrom a research study, which allowed him to temporarily regain some movement\nin one hand. For seven and a half years, he lived with this device\u2014an\nelectrode array nestled into his motor cortex that transmitted signals to a\ncomputer, which then activated electrodes wrapped around his arm. Burkhart now\nheads the BCI Pioneers Coalition, an organization for the small cohort of\nother disabled people who have volunteered their brain to push the boundaries\nof brain-computer-interface technology, or BCI.\n\nLast month, Burkhart, along with perhaps millions of other people, watched the\ndebut of the newest cyborg. In a video posted on X, the first human subject\nfor Elon Musk\u2019s BCI company, Neuralink, appeared to control a laptop via brain\nimplant. Neuralink has not published its research and did not respond to a\nrequest for comment, but the device presumably works this way: The subject, a\nparalyzed 29-year-old named Noland Arbaugh, generates a pattern of neural\nactivity by thinking about something specific, like moving the cursor on his\ncomputer screen or moving his hand. The implant then transmits that pattern of\nneural signals to the computer, where an AI algorithm interprets it as a\ncommand that moves the cursor. Because the implant purportedly allows a user\nto control a computer with their thoughts, more or less, Musk named the device\nTelepathy.\n\nRead: Demon mode activated\n\nBurkhart watched Arbaugh play hands-free computer chess with a mix of approval\nand frustration at how clearly the demo was created for investors and Musk\nfans, not for disabled people like him. It\u2019s no secret that Musk\u2019s real goal\nis to create a BCI device for general consumers, and not just so we can move a\ncursor around; he envisions a future in which humans can access knowledge\ndirectly from computers to \u201cachieve a symbiosis with artificial intelligence.\u201d\nThat dream is ethically fraught\u2014privacy, for instance, is tricky when your\nthoughts are augmented by proprietary algorithms\u2014but it is also a long way\nfrom being realized. Researchers have sort of managed two-way information\ntransfer with rats, but no one is sure how the rats felt about it, or whether\nit\u2019s an experience they\u2019d be willing to pay for at a mall kiosk.\n\n## Recommended Reading\n\n  * ### Dear Therapist: My Boyfriend Is Going Through a Divorce\n\nLori Gottlieb\n\n  * ### The Pentagon\u2019s Army of Nerds\n\nAlec Ross\n\n  * ### Parental Leave Is American Exceptionalism at Its Bleakest\n\nJoe Pinsker\n\nYet a more modest vision for a safe, workable neuro-prosthesis that would\nallow disabled people to use a computer with ease is realizable. The question\nis whether our social structures are ready to keep pace with our advanced\nscience.\n\nIt\u2019s taken decades for BCI tech to get to this point\u2014decades of scientists\nbuilding prototypes by hand and of volunteers who could neither move nor speak\nstruggling to control them. The most basic challenge in mating a brain and a\ncomputer is an incompatibility of materials. Though computers are made of\nsilicon and copper, brains are not. They have a consistency not unlike tapioca\npudding; they wobble. The brain also constantly changes as it learns, and it\ntends to build scar tissue around intrusions. You can\u2019t just stick a wire into\nit.\n\nDifferent developers have tried different solutions to this problem. Neuralink\nis working on flexible filaments that thread inconspicuously\u2014they hope\u2014through\nthe brain tissue. Precision Neuroscience, founded in part by former Neuralink\nscientists, is trying out a kind of electrode-covered Saran Wrap that clings\nto the surface of the brain or slips into its folds. Then there\u2019s the Utah\nArray, a widely used model that looks a little like a hairbrush with its\nbristly pad of silicone spikes. That\u2019s what Burkhart had in his head until\n2021, when the study he was part of lost funding and he decided to have the\nimplant taken out. He was worried surgeons might have to \u201cremove some chunks\nof brain\u201d along with it. Luckily, he told me, it came out \u201cwithout too much of\na fight.\u201d\n\nOnce an implant is in place, the tiny signals of individual neurons\u2014measurable\nin microvolts\u2014have to be amplified, digitized, and transmitted, preferably by\na unit that\u2019s both wireless and inconspicuous. That\u2019s problem number two.\nProblem three is decoding those signals. We have no real idea of how the brain\ntalks to itself, so a machine-learning algorithm has to use a brute-force\napproach, finding patterns in neural activity and learning to correlate them\nwith whatever the person with the implant is trying to make the computer do.\n\nNone of these problems is trivial, but they\u2019ve been substantially tackled over\nthe past 30 years of BCI research. At least six different companies are now\ntesting applications such as desktop interfaces (like the one that helped\nArbaugh play chess), drivers for robotic limbs and exoskeletons, and even\nspeech prostheses that give voice to thought. Proof-of-concept devices exist\nfor all of these by now.\n\nBut that only brings us to problem number four\u2014which has nothing to do with\nengineering and might be harder to solve than all the others. This problem is\nwhat Ben Rapoport, the chief science officer at Precision, described to me as\n\u201cthe productization of science.\u201d It\u2019s where engineering successes run into\npolitical and economic obstacles. To roll out even a basic point-and-click\nmedical BCI interface, developers would have to win approval not just from the\nFDA but also from \u201cpayers\u201d: Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance\ncompanies. This is make-or-break: Medical devices, even ingenious ones, won\u2019t\nget to consumers if insurance won\u2019t cover them. Few people can afford such\nexpenses out of pocket, which means too small a pool of potential consumers to\nmake production profitable.\n\nRead: I\u2019m disabled. Please help me.\n\nOther devices have cleared this hurdle\u2014cochlear implants, deep-brain\nstimulation devices, pacemakers\u2014and it\u2019s not unlikely that BCI implants could\njoin that list if insurers decide they\u2019re worth the expense. On the one hand,\ninsurance companies might argue that BCI devices aren\u2019t strictly medically\nnecessary\u2014they\u2019re \u201clife-enhancing,\u201d not \u201clife-sustaining,\u201d as Burkhart put\nit\u2014but on the other hand, insurers are likely to see them as cost-efficient if\ntheir implementation can save money on other, more expensive kinds of support.\n\nEven so, there\u2019s a limit to what brain implants can do and what they can\nreplace. The people who would benefit most from BCI devices, people with major\nmotor impairments like Arbaugh and Burkhart, would still depend on human labor\nfor many things, such as getting in and out of bed, bathing, dressing, and\neating. That labor can easily cost as much as six figures a year and isn\u2019t\ntypically reimbursed by private health-insurance companies. For most people,\nthe only insurer that covers this kind of care is Medicaid, which in most\nstates comes with stringent restrictions on recipients\u2019 income and assets.\n\nIn Ohio, where Burkhart lives, Medicaid recipients can\u2019t keep more than $2,000\nin assets or make more than $943 a month without losing coverage. (A waiver\nprogram raises the monthly income cap for some to $2,829.) The salary they\u2019d\nhave to make to cover both expenses and in-home care out of pocket, though, is\nmuch more than most jobs pay. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t have the opportunity to\nmake such a giant leap,\u201d Burkhart said. \u201cThe system is set up to force you to\nlive in poverty.\u201d\n\nIn addition to his work with the BCI Pioneers Coalition, Burkhart also leads a\nnonprofit foundation that fundraises to help people with disabilities cover\nsome of the expenses insurance won\u2019t pay for. But these expenses would be\n\u201cnowhere near the size that would pay to get a BCI or anything like that,\u201d he\ntold me. \u201cWe do a lot of shower chairs. Or hand controls for a vehicle.\u201d\n\nStarting in the late 20th century, simple switch devices began to enable\npeople with severe motor disabilities to access computers. As a result, many\npeople who would previously have been institutionalized\u2014those who can\u2019t speak,\nfor example, or move most of their body\u2014are able to communicate and use the\ninternet. BCI has the potential to be much more powerful than switch access,\nwhich is slow and janky by comparison. Yet the people who receive the first\ngeneration of medical implants may find themselves in the same position as\nthose who use switch technology now: functionally required to stay unemployed,\npoor, or even single as a condition of accessing the services keeping them\nalive.\n\nMusk may be right that we\u2019re quickly approaching a time when BCI tech is\npractical and even ubiquitous. But right now, we don\u2019t have a social consensus\non how to apportion resources such as health care, and many disabled people\nstill lack the basic supports necessary to access society. Those are problems\nthat technology alone will not\u2014and cannot\u2014solve.\n\nS.I.
