It\u2019s the water. Of course,\nwater is used to make food, clean salad and veggies, wash dishes, make ice,\nand more.\n\n## What Makes Good Tap Water?\n\nIt is important to avoid drinking tap water in places where it just isn\u2019t safe\nto drink because it is contaminated with harmful substances such as lead,\nmercury, chlorine, and arsenic. This is the problem with tap water in\ncountries such as Algeria, Cambodia, and Haiti. But some of the dirtiest tap\nwater in the world is in the United States, we\u2019re talking about you Illinois\nand Michigan.\n\nIn contrast, Chile has some of the purest tap water anywhere in the world. It\nis almost completely free of bad chemical compounds. But while locals in\nSantiago might drink it freely, visitors might want to think twice. The water\nhas a high natural mineral content that can wreak havoc with your stomach if\nyou aren\u2019t accustomed to it. If you are staying for a couple of months, it is\nprobably worth adapting. But if you are only staying for a few weeks, you\nmight want to stick to bottled water.\n\nBut, to complicate matters, it is not just the water source that you need to\nworry about. Brazil has many excellent sources of very clean water, but it is\nstill not recommended to drink tap water. This is because the quality of the\npipe infrastructure in cities and individual homes isn\u2019t great, so the clean\nwater can become contaminated between where it is sourced and treated and\nwhere you turn on the tap.\n\nWith so many things to consider, you might think that it is safer to stick to\nbottled water in general when traveling. But, if the local tap water is safe\nto drink, you should definitely drink it.\n\nAround 85% of plastic water bottles are thrown away rather than recycled. A\nhuge volume of water bottles end up in the ocean, contributing to a \u201cplastic\nsmog\u201d composed of around 171 trillion plastic particles. They also break down\ninto microplastics, that make their way into food and water, making more of\nthe world\u2019s water unsafe to drink.\n\nPlastic water bottles are an environmental disaster.\n\n## 10 Countries with the Purest Drinkable Tap Water\n\nSo, of all the countries in the world, which has the purest tap water, and\nwill you be adding any of these countries to your digital nomad destination\nlist? Bear in mind that while we are talking about entire countries, you\nshould always check local conditions. Are the locals drinking it?\n\n### Iceland\n\nHome of the Northern Lights and the Icelandic Viking Sagas, Iceland also has\nsome of the purest tap water in the world. This is perhaps no surprise since\naround 6% of the country is covered in rivers and freshwater lakes, often fed\nby glaciers. It also has a small population density, which means less pressure\non natural resources.\n\nIceland does actually have a digital nomad visa for six months renewable, but\nthe minimum income requirement is more than US$7,000 per month. Read our guide\nto Iceland for digital nomads.\n\nGreenland, which is politically part of Denmark, also has excellent water for\nsimilar reasons if you want to visit. Yes, people live there.\n\n### Switzerland and Austria\n\nIt should be no surprise that a wealthy country with excellent infrastructure\nand characterized by an Alpine Mountain landscape has some very good drinking\nwater. Water is sourced from lakes, springs, and groundwater, and strict water\nquality procedures are in place.\n\nHead to Switzerland for skiing in winter and walking the rest of the year\nwhere you can bathe in beautiful lakes while enjoying clean and delicious tap\nwater. Discover the top places to visit in Switzerland.\n\nAustria has excellent tap water for similar reasons, with water coming\nstraight from the alps with minimal artificial intervention in terms of\npurifying and adding chemicals. Not only can you drink the tap water, but you\ncan drink directly from street fountains, at least in Vienna.\n\n### Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Denmark\n\nThe Vikings were seafaring people who knew their water, and all the former\nViking nations of Europe (plus Finland, since the Finns weren\u2019t Vikings) have\ngreat tap water.\n\nSweden is a land of fjords and lakes. Combine this with strict environmental\npolicies, and Sweden has excellent tap water. While dams feed the major\ncities, in the countryside, many people rely on freshwater wells that are\ndesigned to be good for the environment and minimize pollution.\n\nNorway has similarly excellent tap water, with 377 billion cubic meters\nsourced each year from lakes, glaciers, ponds, streams, and groundwater.\nHowever, locals are encouraged to use water economically to preserve the\nprecious resource.\n\nFinland actually had a major water problem until about 30 years ago due to\nfactory residues polluting lakes and rivers. But following a concerted effort\nto stop water contamination, Finland now has some of the cleanest water in the\nworld.\n\nFinally, the seaside country of Denmark sources its tap water from deep\nunderground reservoirs, where it is largely protected from contaminants. It is\npurified through sand filters before being sent to homes around the small\nnation.\n\n### Australia and New Zealand\n\nA young nation with plenty of natural resources, Australia has many freshwater\nsources that it maintains through strict standards, monitoring, and control\nprocedures. In some states, they even add one milligram of fluoride to the\nwater per liter in line with medical guidelines, helping children develop\nstronger and healthier teeth.\n\nBut while tap water in Australia is safe and delicious, don\u2019t forget that the\ncenter of the country is a giant desert and that it is prone to droughts.\nDuring drought seasons, while you can continue to drink the tap water, you\ncan\u2019t water your garden. You should also limit yourself to two-minute showers,\ndo laundry just once a week, and flush only when \u201cnecessary\u201d.\n\nNew Zealand joins its neighbor in having great tap water, with around 3% of\nthe nation covered in fresh water. With a small population and an\nenvironmentally conscious government, water is managed well. Most New\nZealanders choose tap water.\n\n### Canada\n\nCanada is a land of mountains, lakes, and glaciers, so has plenty of\nfreshwater sources to utilize for tap water. And Canadians take their tap\nwater seriously! In Ottawa, over 125,000 quality tests are conducted annually,\nand in Toronto, water is tested every 4-6 hours.\n\nCanada is a giant nation of natural (if chilly) beauty and is also very\nwelcoming. Not only has Canada opened their borders to digital nomads, but you\nare free to look for work while in Canada and transition to a work visa.\n\n### Estonia and Lithuania\n\nThe Balkan countries of Estonia and Lithuania both have excellent tap water\nthanks to huge deposits of underground water which are fairly safe from human\nintervention.\n\nEstonia also offers a digital nomad visa and has an innovative e-resident\nprogram that appeals to many digital entrepreneurs.\n\n## What About Everywhere Else?\n\nThese aren\u2019t the only places in the world where it is safe to drink the tap\nwater. You can drink it in the United Kingdom, Ireland, most of Europe, most\nof the United States, and many other places. But what can you do to minimize\nyour reliance on bottled water where the water isn\u2019t safe to drink? Also carry\na reusable cup, as plastic cups are another major problem.\n\nFirst, invest in a good quality water bottle that is convenient to carry with\nyou. Maybe you prefer something that clips onto your backpack, or maybe\nsomething collapsable. Choose something that you will carry with you,\neverywhere, and fill it up with clean water at every opportunity.\n\nIn your accommodation, you can boil water before chilling it to drink. You can\nalso carry purifiers, such as Aquatabs, or a sterilizing straw with you to\nclean water in emergencies. If you need a drink on the beach in a tropical\ncountry, think about getting a coconut instead. It is delicious, healthy, and\nthe natural packaging is biodegradable.\n\nOf course, sometimes you just need to buy a bottled water, and you shouldn\u2019t\nbeat yourself up about it as long as you are doing the right thing most of the\ntime. But try and reuse or recycle the bottle wherever possible.\n\n### Related posts:\n\nBest and Worst Countries for Expats to Call Home Kyrgyzstan Introduces Digital\nNomad Visa for Citizens of Select Countries The Top 100 Countries for Remote\nWorkers Canada Announced a Digital Nomad Visa\n\n### You may also like\n\nBest and Worst Countries for Expats to Call Home Kyrgyzstan Introduces Digital\nNomad Visa for Citizens of Select Countries 4 European Countries that Offer\nDigital Nomad Visas The Top 100 Countries for Remote Workers New Digital Nomad\nVisa for Ecuador Now Available Canada Announced a Digital Nomad Visa\n\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n\n## Get the Latest News for Location-Independent Professionals!\n\n  * 1 newsletter/week\n  * We keep your data safe\n  * Unsubscribe anytime\n\n## Digital Nomad FAQ\n\n### What is a Digital Nomad?\n\n### Skills you Need to Become a Digital Nomad?\n\n### How Much Money Can I Earn as A Digital Nomad?\n\n### Do Digital Nomads Pay Taxes?\n\n### Is it Legal to be a Digital Nomad?\n\n## Remote Working\n\n### How to transition to remote working?\n\n### 14 tips to prevent remote working burnout\n\n### Boost your charisma on video calls\n\n### Covid has accelerated the demand of freelancers\n\n### 5 tips to increase your productivity\n\n## Well-being\n\n### Ikigai, finding your purpose\n\n### Staying fit as a digital nomad\n\n### Morning routine\n\n### Exercises to stay fit on the road\n\n### Balancing your work and social life\n\n## Hot Topics\n\n### 10 Best Cities for Digital Nomads\n\n### The Digital Nomad Gear\n\n### The Ultimate Digital Nomad Packing Guide\n\n### Guide for Health Insurance Plans\n\n### Best Retreats and Conferences for DN\n\n## About\n\n### About\n\n### Xpoint Consultancy Services\n\n### Webseries\n\n### They talk about us\n\n### Contact\n\n  * Follow\n  * Follow\n  * Follow\n  * Follow\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 \u2013 www.andysto.com\n\n", "frontpage": false}
