No puzzle spoilers,\nhowever...\n\nThe ending of 1991\u2019s Monkey Island 2: LeChuck\u2019s Revenge is as shocking in its\nway as that of the infamous last episode of the classic television series St.\nElsewhere. Just as the lovable wannabe pirate Guybrush Threepwood is about to\nfinally dispatch his arch-nemesis, the zombie pirate LeChuck, the latter tears\noff his mask to reveal that he is in reality Guybrush\u2019s older brother, looking\nrather irritated but hardly evil or undead. Guybrush, it seems, is just an\nordinary suburban kid who has wandered away from his family to play make-\nbelieve inside a storage room at Big Whoop Amusement Park, LeChuck the family\nmember who has been dispatched to find him. An irate janitor appears on the\nscene: \u201cHey, kids! You\u2019re not supposed to be in here!\u201d And so the brothers\nmake their way out to rejoin their worried parents, and another set of Middle\nAmerican lives goes on.\n\nThe ending served partially as Ron Gilbert\u2019s homage to one of his games\u2019\ninspirations, the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland. In more\npractical terms, however, it steered the burgeoning Monkey Island franchise\nstraight into a cul de sac with no obvious escape. Gilbert soon left LucasArts\nto found Humongous Entertainment, where he would use the SCUMM graphic-\nadventure engine he had helped to invent to make educational games for\nyoungsters, even as LucasArts would continue to evolve the same technology to\nmake more adventure games of their own. It\u2019s hard not to imagine Gilbert\ncackling over his shoulder like LeChuck himself as he walks out the door,\nconfident that he has sequel-proofed Monkey Island for all time: \u201cLet\u2019s see\nyou write your way out of that ending!\u201d\n\nFor a surprisingly long time, LucasArts really did seem nonplussed by the trap\nGilbert had sprung on them. A third Monkey Island game was nowhere to be seen,\nnot even after the first two became icons of their genre. Still, it is a law\nof the games industry that sequels to hit games will out, sooner or later and\none way or another. In late 1995, LucasArts\u2019s management decided to make a\nthird Monkey Island at last, trick ending be damned. Why they chose to do so\nat this particular juncture isn\u2019t entirely clear. Perhaps they could already\nsense an incipient softening of the adventure market \u2014 a downturn that would\nbecome all too obvious over the next eighteen months or so \u2014 and wanted the\nsecurity of such an established name as this one if they were to invest big\nbucks in another adventure project. Or perhaps they just thought they had\nwaited long enough.\n\nLarry Ahern and Jonathan Ackley.\n\nWhatever their reasoning in beginning the project, they chose for the gnarly\ntask of finding a way out of the trap laid by Ron Gilbert an in-house artist\nand a programmer, a pair of good friends who had been employed at LucasArts\nfor years and were itching to move into a design role. Larry Ahern had been\nhired to help draw Monkey Island 2 and had gone on to work on most of\nLucasArts\u2019s adventure games since, while Jonathan Ackley had programmed large\nparts of Day of the Tentacle and The Dig. Knowing of their design aspirations,\nmanagement came to them one day to ask if they\u2019d like to become co-leads on a\nprospective Monkey Island 3. It was an extraordinary amount of faith to place\nin such unproven hands, but it would not prove to have been misplaced.\n\n\u201cWe were too green to suggest anything else [than Monkey Island 3], especially\nan original concept,\u201d admits Ahern, \u201cand were too dumb to worry about all the\nresponsibility of updating a classic game series.\u201d He and Ackley brainstormed\ntogether in a room for two months, hashing out the shape of a game. After they\nemerged early in 1996 with their design bible for The Curse of Monkey Island\nin hand, production got underway in earnest.\n\nAhern and Ackley escaped from Ron Gilbert\u2019s trap about as nimbly as anyone\ncould have \u2014 which is to say, not very nimbly at all. At the end of Monkey\nIsland 2, they announced, Guybrush had actually been \u201chexed\u201d by LeChuck into\nbelieving he was just a little boy in an amusement park. By the beginning of\nthe third game, he would have snapped back to his senses, abandoning mundane\nhallucination again for a fantastical piratey reality.\n\nA team that peaked at 50 people labored over The Curse of Monkey Island for\neighteen months. That period was one of dramatic change in the industry, when\nphrases like \u201cmultimedia\u201d and \u201cinteractive movie\u201d were consigned to the\nkitschy past and first-person shooters and real-time strategies came to\ndominate the sales charts. Having committed to the project, LucasArts felt\nthey had no choice but to stick with the old-school pixel art that had always\nmarked their adventure games, even though it too was fast becoming pass\u00e9 in\nthis newly 3D world. By way of compensation, this latest LucasArts pixel art\nwas to be more luscious than anything that had come out of the studio before,\ntaking advantage of a revamped SCUMM engine that could now display thousands\nof colors at once at a resolution of 640 X 480. (How strange to think that\nthis technology had been born on a 16-color Commodore 64!)\n\nThe end result is, in the opinion of this critic at least, the loveliest\nsingle game in terms of pure visuals that LucasArts ever produced. Computer\ngraphics and animation, at LucasArts and elsewhere, had advanced enormously\nbetween Monkey Island 2 and The Curse of Monkey Island. With 1993\u2019s Day of the\nTentacle and Sam and Max Hit the Road, LucasArts\u2019s animators had begun\nproducing work that could withstand comparison to that of role models like\nChuck Jones and Dan Bluth without being laughed out of the room. (Indeed,\nJones reportedly tried to hire Larry Ahern and some of his colleagues away\nfrom LucasArts after seeing Day of the Tentacle.) The Curse of Monkey Island\nmarked the fruition of that process, showing LucasArts to have become a world-\nclass animation studio in its own right, one that could not just withstand but\nwelcome comparison with any and all peers who worked with more traditional,\nlinear forms of media. \u201cWe were looking at Disney feature animation as our\nquality bar,\u201d says Ahern.\n\nThat said, the challenge of producing a game that still looked like Monkey\nIsland despite all the new technical affordances should not be underestimated.\nThe danger of increased resolution and color count was always that the\nfinished results could veer into a sort of photo-realism, losing the\nramshackle charm that had always been such a big part of Monkey Island\u2018s\nappeal. This LucasArts managed to avoid; in the words of The Animation World\nNetwork, a trade organization that was impressed enough by the project to come\nout and do a feature on it, Guybrush was drawn as \u201ca pencil-necked beanpole\nwith a flounce of eighteenth-century hair and a nose as vertical as the face\nof Half Dome.\u201d The gangling frames and exaggerated movements of Guybrush and\nmany of the other characters were inspired by Tim Burton\u2019s The Nightmare\nBefore Christmas. Yet the characters aren\u2019t grotesques; The Curse of Monkey\nIsland aims to be lovable, and it hits the mark.\n\nFor this game is written as well as drawn in the spirit of the original Secret\nof Monkey Island, abandoning the jarring mean-spiritedness that dogs the\nsecond game in the series even long before you get to that ending, a change in\ntone that has always left me a lot less positively disposed toward it than\nmost people seem to be. The three principal characters here are once again\nGuybrush, LeChuck, and their mutual love interest, the spirited and fetching\nlady pirate Elaine. This was the first Monkey Island game to feature voice\nacting from the outset, as telling a testament as any to the technological\ngulf that lies between the second and third entries in the series. The\nperformances are superb \u2014 especially Guybrush, who sounds exactly like I want\nhim to, all gawky innocence and dogged determination. (His voice actor Dominic\nArmato would return for every single Monkey Island game that followed, as well\nas circling back to give Guybrush a voice in the remastered versions of the\nfirst two games. I, for one, wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.)\n\nThe opening sees Guybrush adrift on the open ocean in, of all forms of\nconveyance, a floating bumper car, for reasons that aren\u2019t initially clear\nbeyond the thematic connection to that amusement park at the end of Monkey\nIsland 2. He floats smack-dab into the middle of a sea battle between LeChuck\nand Elaine; the former is trying to abduct the latter to make her his bride,\nwhile the latter is doing her level best to maintain her single status. Stuff\nhappens, LeChuck seems to get blown up, and Guybrush and Elaine wind up on\nPlunder Island, a retirement community for aging pirates that\u2019s incidentally\nalso inhabited by El Pollo Diablo, the giant demon chicken. (\u201cHe\u2019s hatching a\ndiabolical scheme\u201d; \u201cHe\u2019s establishing a new pecking order\u201d; \u201cHe\u2019s going to\nbuck buck buck the system\u201d; \u201cHe\u2019s crossing the road to freedom\u201d; etc.)\nGuybrush proposes to Elaine using a diamond ring he stole from the hold of\nLeChuck\u2019s ship, only to find that there\u2019s a voodoo curse laid on it. Elaine\ngets turned into a solid-gold statue (doh!), which Guybrush leaves standing on\nthe beach while he tries to figure out what to do about the situation. Sure\nenough, some opportunistic pirates \u2014 is there any other kind? \u2014 sail away with\nit. (Double doh!) Guybrush is left to scour Plunder Island for a ship, a crew,\nand a map that will let him follow them to Blood Island, where there is\nconveniently supposed to be another diamond ring that can reverse the curse.\n\nThe vicious chickens of Plunder Island. \u201cLarry and I thought we were so clever\nwhen we came up with the idea of having a tropical island covered with feral\nchickens,\u201d says Jonathan Ackley. \u201cThen I took a vacation to the Hawaiian\nisland of Kauai. It seems that when Kauai was hit by Hurricane Iniki, it blew\nopen all the chicken coops. Everywhere I went on the island I was surrounded\nby feral chickens.\u201d\n\nFrom the shopping list of quest items to the plinking steelband soundtrack\nthat undergirds the proceedings, all of this is a dead ringer for The Secret\nof Monkey Island; this third game is certainly not interested in breaking any\nnew ground in setting, story, or genre. But it when it\u2019s done this well, who\ncares? There is a vocal segment of Monkey Island fans who reject this game on\nprinciple, who say that any Monkey Island game without the name of Ron Gilbert\nfirst on its credits list is no Monkey Island game at all. For my own part, I\ntend to believe that, if we didn\u2019t know that Gilbert didn\u2019t work on this game,\nwe\u2019d have trouble detecting that fact from the finished product. It nails that\nmixture of whimsy, cleverness, and sweetness that has made The Secret of\nMonkey Island arguably the most beloved point-and-click adventure game of all\ntime.\n\nDuring the latter 1990s, when most computers games were still made by and for\na fairly homogeneous cohort of young men, too much ludic humor tried to get by\non transgression rather than wit; this was a time of in-groups punching \u2014\nusually punching down \u2014 on out-groups. I\u2019m happy to say that The Curse of\nMonkey Island\u2018s humor is nothing like that. At the very beginning, when\nGuybrush is floating in that bumper car, he scribbles in his journal about all\nthe things he wishes he had. \u201cIf only I could have a small drink of\nfreshwater, I might have the strength to sail on.\u201d A bottle of water drifts\npast while Guybrush\u2019s eyes are riveted to the page. \u201cIf I could reach land, I\nmight find water and some food. Fruit maybe, something to fight off the scurvy\nand help me get my strength back. Maybe some bananas.\u201d And a crate of bananas\ndrifts by in the foreground. \u201cOh, why do I torture myself like this? I might\nas well wish for some chicken and a big mug of grog, for all the good it will\ndo me.\u201d Cue the clucking chicken perched on top of a barrel. Now, you might\nsay that this isn\u2019t exactly sophisticated humor, and you\u2019d be right. But it\u2019s\nan inclusive sort of joke that absolutely everyone is guaranteed to\nunderstand, from children to the elderly, whilst also being a gag that I defy\nanyone not to at least smirk at. Monkey Island is funny without ever being the\nslightest bit cruel \u2014 a combination that\u2019s rarer in games of its era than it\nought to be.\n\nWhich isn\u2019t to say that this game is without in-jokes. They\u2019re everywhere, and\nthe things they reference are far from unexpected. Star Trek gets a shout-out\nin literally the first line of the script as Guybrush writes in his \u201ccaptain\u2019s\nlog,\u201d while, appropriately enough given the studio that made this game, whole\nchunks of dialogue are re-contextualized extracts from the Star Wars movies.\nThe middle of the game is an extended riff on/parody of that other, very\ndifferent franchise that springs to mind when gamers think about pirates \u2014 the\none started by Sid Meier, that\u2019s known as simply Pirates!. Here as there, you\nhave to sail your ship around the Caribbean engaging in battles with other sea\ndogs. But instead of dueling the opposing captains with your trusty cutlass\nwhen you board their vessels, here you challenge them to a round of insult\nsword-fighting instead. (Pirate: \u201cNow I know what filth and stupidity really\nare!\u201d Guybrush: \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear you attended your family reunion.\u201d)\n\nOne of the game\u2019s best gags is an interactive musical number you perform with\nyour piratey crew, feeding them appropriate rhymes. \u201cAs far as I know, nobody\nhad ever done interactive singing before,\u201d says Jonathan Ackley. \u201cI think it\nwas an original idea and I still laugh when I see it.\u201d Sadly, the song was cut\nfrom the game\u2019s foreign localizations as a bridge too far from its native\nEnglish, even for LucasArts\u2019s superb translators.\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t work, but somehow it does. In fact, this may just be my favorite\nsection of the entire game. Partly it succeeds because it\u2019s just so well done;\nthe action-based minigame of ship-to-ship combat that precedes each round of\ninsult sword-fighting is, in marked contrast to those in LucasArts\u2019s previous\nadventure Full Throttle, very playable in its own right, being perfectly\npitched in difficulty, fun without ever becoming frustrating. But another key\nto this section\u2019s success is that you don\u2019t have to know Pirates! for it to\nmake you laugh; it\u2019s just that, if you do, you\u2019ll laugh that little bit more.\nAll of the in-jokes operate the same way.\n\nPirates! veterans will feel right at home with the ship-combat minigame. It\nwas originally more complicated. \u201cWhen I first started the ship-combat\nsection,\u201d says programmer Chris Purvis, \u201cI had a little readout that told how\nmany cannons you had, when they were ready to fire, and a damage printout for\nwhen you or the computer ships got hit. We decided it was too un-adventure-\ngamey to leave it that way.\u201d Not to be outdone, a member of the testing team\nproposed implementing multiplayer ship combat as an \u201cthe greatest Easter egg\nof all time for any game.\u201d Needless to say, it didn\u2019t happen.\n\nThe puzzle design makes for an interesting study. After 1993, the year of Day\nof the Tentacle and Sam and Max Hit the Road, LucasArts hit a bumpy patch in\nthis department in my opinion. Both Full Throttle and The Dig, their only\nadventures between those games and this one, are badly flawed efforts when it\ncomes to their puzzles, adhering to the letter but not the spirit of Ron\nGilbert\u2019s old \u201cWhy Adventure Games Suck\u201d manifesto. And Grim Fandango, the\nadventure that immediately followed this one, fairs if anything even worse in\nthat regard. I\u2019m pleased if somewhat perplexed to be able to say, then, that\nThe Curse of Monkey Island mostly gets its puzzles right.\n\nThere are two difficulty levels here, an innovation borrowed from Monkey\nIsland 2. Although the puzzles at the \u201cMega-Monkey\u201d level are pretty darn\nconvoluted \u2014 one sequence involving a restaurant and a pirate\u2019s tooth springs\nespecially to mind as having one more layer of complexity that it really needs\nto \u2014 they are never completely beyond the pale. It might not be a totally\ncrazy idea to play The Curse of Monkey Island twice, once at the easy level\nand once at the Mega-Monkey level, with a few weeks or months in between your\nplaythroughs. There are very few adventure games for which I would make such a\nrecommendation in our current era of entertainment saturation, but I think\nit\u2019s a reasonable one in this case. This game is stuffed so full of jokes both\novert and subtle that it can be hard to take the whole thing in in just one\npass. Your first excursion will give you the lay of the land, so to speak, so\nyou know roughly what you\u2019re trying to accomplish when you tackle the more\ncomplicated version.\n\nRegardless of how you approach it, The Curse of Monkey Island is a big,\ngenerous adventure game by any standard. I daresay that the part that takes\nplace on Plunder Island alone is just about as long as the entirety of The\nSecret of Monkey Island. After that comes the Pirates! homage, to serve as a\nnice change of pace at the perfect time. And then there\u2019s another whole island\nof almost equal size to the first to explore. After all that comes the bravura\nclimax, where LeChuck makes his inevitable return; in a rather cheeky move,\nthis ending too takes place in an amusement park, with Guybrush once again\ntransformed into a child. Whatever else you can say about their way of\nescaping Ron Gilbert\u2019s trap, you can\u2019t accuse Larry Ahern and Jonathan Ackley\nof simply hand-waving it away.\n\nIf I was determined to find something to complain about, I might say that the\nback half of The Curse of the Monkey Island isn\u2019t quite as strong as the front\nhalf. Blood Island is implemented a little more sparsely than Plunder Island,\nand the big climax in particular feels a little rushed and truncated,\ndoubtless the result of a production budget and schedule that just couldn\u2019t be\nstretched any further if the game was to ship in time for the 1997 Christmas\nseason. Still, these are venal sins; commercial game development is always the\nart of the possible, usually at the expense of the ideal.\n\nWhen all is said and done, The Curse of Monkey Island might just be my\nfavorite LucasArts adventure, although it faces some stiff competition from\nThe Secret of Monkey Island and Day of the Tentacle. Any points that it loses\nto Secret for its lack of originality in the broad strokes, it makes up for in\nsize, in variety, and in sheer gorgeousness.\n\nAlthough I have no firm sales figures to point to, all indications are that\nThe Curse of Monkey Island was a commercial success in its day, the last\nLucasArts adventure about which that statement can be made. I would guess from\nanecdotal evidence that it sold several hundred thousand copies, enough to\nconvince the company to go back to the Monkey Island well one more time in\n2000. Alas, the fourth game would be far less successful, both artistically\nand commercially.\n\nThese things alone are enough to give Curse a valedictory quality today. But\nthere\u2019s more: it was also the very last LucasArts game to use the SCUMM\nengine, as well as the last to rely primarily on pixel art. The world-class\ncartoon-animation studio that the company\u2019s adventure division had become was\nwound down after this game\u2019s release, and Larry Ahern and Jonathan Ackley were\nnever given a chance to lead a project such as this one again, despite having\nacquitted themselves so well here. That was regrettable, but not\nincomprehensible. Economics weren\u2019t working in the adventure genre\u2019s favor in\nthe late 1990s. A game like The Curse of Monkey Island was more expensive to\nmake per hour of play time it provided than any other kind of game you could\nimagine; all of this game\u2019s content was bespoke content, every interaction a\nunique one that had to be written and story-boarded and drawn and painted and\nanimated and voiced from scratch.\n\nThe only way that adventure games \u2014 at least adventures with AAA production\nvalues like this one \u2014 could have remained an appealing option for gaming\nexecutives would have been if they had sold in truly massive numbers. And this\nthey emphatically were not doing. Yes, The Curse of Monkey Island did\nreasonably well for itself \u2014 but a game like Jedi Knight probably did close to\nan order of magnitude better, whilst probably costing considerably less to\nmake. The business logic wasn\u2019t overly complicated. The big animation studios\nwhich LucasArts liked to see as their peers could get away with it because\ntheir potential market was everyone with a television or everyone who could\nafford to buy a $5 movie ticket; LucasArts, on the other hand, was limited to\nthose people who owned fairly capable, modern home computers, who liked to\nsolve crazily convoluted puzzles, and who were willing and able to drop $40 or\n$50 for ten hours or so of entertainment. The numbers just didn\u2019t add up.\n\nIn a sense, then, the surprise isn\u2019t that LucasArts made no more games like\nthis one, but rather that they allowed this game to be finished at all.\nJonathan Ackley recalls his reaction when he saw Half-Life for the first time:\n\u201cWell... that\u2019s kind of it for adventure games as a mainstream, AAA genre.\u201d\nMore to their credit than otherwise, the executives at LucasArts didn\u2019t\nsummarily abandon the adventure genre, but rather tried their darnedest to\nfind a way to make the economics work, by embracing 3D modelling to reduce\nproduction costs and deploying a new interface that would be a more natural\nfit with the tens of millions of game consoles that were out there, thus\nbroadening their potential customer base enormously. We\u2019ll get to the noble if\nflawed efforts that resulted from these initiatives in due course.\n\nFor today, though, we raise our glasses to The Curse of Monkey Island, the\nlast and perhaps the best go-round for SCUMM. If you haven\u2019t played it yet, by\nall means, give it a shot. And even if you have, remember what I told you\nearlier: this is a game that can easily bear replaying. Its wit, sweetness,\nand beauty remain undiminished more than a quarter of a century after its\nconception.\n\nThe Curse of Monkey Island: The Graphic Novel\n\n(I\u2019ve cheerfully stolen this progression from the old Prima strategy guide to\nthe game...)\n\nOur story begins with our hero, Guybrush Threepwood, lost at sea and pining\nfor his love Elaine.\n\nHe soon discovers her in the midst of a pitched battle...\n\n...with his old enemy and rival for her fair hand, the zombie pirate LeChuck.\n\nGuybrush is captured by LeChuck...\n\n...but manages to escape, sending LeChuck\u2019s ship to the bottom in the process.\nThinking LeChuck finally disposed of, Guybrush proposes to Elaine, using a\ndiamond ring he found in the zombie pirate\u2019s treasure hold...\n\n...only to discover it is cursed. Elaine is less than pleased...\n\n...and is even more ticked off when she is turned into a gold statue.\n\nGuybrush sets off to discover a way to break the curse \u2014 and to rescue Elaine,\nsince her statue is promptly stolen. His old friend the voodoo lady tells him\nhe will need a ship, a crew, and a map to Blood Island, where he can find a\nsecond diamond ring that will reverse the evil magic of the first.\n\nHe meets many interesting and irritating people, including some barbers...\n\n...a restaurateur...\n\n...and a cabana boy, before he is finally able to set sail for Blood Island.\n\nAfter some harrowing sea battles and a fierce storm...\n\n...his ship is washed ashore on Blood Island.\n\nMeanwhile LeChuck has been revived...\n\n...and has commanded his minions to scour the Caribbean in search of Guybrush.\n\nUnaware of this, Guybrush explores Blood Island, where he meets a patrician\nbartender...\n\n...the ghost of a Southern belle...\n\n...a vegan cannibal...\n\n...and a Welsh ferryman.\n\nHe finally outsmarts Andre, King of the Smugglers, to get the diamond that\nwill restore Elaine.\n\nUnfortunately, as soon as Elaine is uncursed, the two are captured by LeChuck\nand taken to the Carnival of the Damned on Monkey Island.\n\nLeChuck turns Guybrush into a little boy and attempts to escape with Elaine on\nhis hellish roller coaster.\n\nBut Guybrush\u2019s quick thinking saves the day, and he sails off with his new\nbride into the sunset.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?
