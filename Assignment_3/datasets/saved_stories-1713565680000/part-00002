Provenance is a frontend for many existing emulators, and\nit would allow iPhone and Apple TV users to emulate games released for a wide\nvariety of classic game consoles, including the original PlayStation,\nGameCube, Wii, SEGA Genesis, Atari 2600, and others.\n\nApple has so far approved emulators on the App Store for older Nintendo\nconsoles and the Commodore 64. For example, Riley Testut's popular Delta\nemulator is now in the App Store in many countries, and it can emulate games\nreleased for the Game Boy Pocket, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, Nintendo\nEntertainment System (NES), Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES),\nNintendo 64, and Nintendo DS. Provenance would bring the first Sony, SEGA, and\nAtari emulators to the App Store if approved.\n\nProvenance has been in development since 2016, and it can already be\nsideloaded on the iPhone and the Apple TV outside of the App Store.\n\nApple updated its App Review Guidelines earlier this month to allow \"retro\ngame console emulator apps\" on the App Store for the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and\nother devices. Earlier this week, Apple told us that emulators that can load\ngames (ROMs) are permitted on the App Store, so long as the apps are emulating\n\"retro console games\" only. It is unclear if Apple will consider consoles like\nthe GameCube and Wii to be \"retro.\"\n\nWhile a U.S. court ruled that emulators are legal, downloading copyrighted\nROMs is typically against the law in the country. On its customer support\nwebsite for the U.S., Nintendo says that downloading pirated copies of its\ngames is illegal. A wide collection of public-domain \"homebrew\" games are\navailable to play legally.\n\nTags: App Store, Emulator\n\n[ 57 comments ]\n\n## Top Rated Comments\n\nmdnz\n\n1 hour ago at 08:44 am\n\nApple might as well stop with Apple Arcade, this stuff is going to blow it out\nof the water as a free app. No wonder they wanted to block emulators for so\nlong.\n\nScore: 10 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nvertsix\n\n1 hour ago at 08:46 am\n\nWe've come full circle...\n\nScore: 7 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nBaron Thompson\n\n1 hour ago at 08:32 am\n\nCommodore on the big screen Apple tv.

This is sick!\n\nCommodore 64 emulation is not available in the Provenance emulator that my\nMacRumors story is focused on. I did link to a separate Commodore 64 emulator\n('https://apps.apple.com/us/app/emu64-xl/id6483251916') that is already\navailable on the App Store, but it is only for the iPhone and iPad. However,\nyou should be able to mirror it to the Apple TV via AirPlay.
