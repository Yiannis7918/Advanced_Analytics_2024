Even so, the U.S. Department of Justice\npresented the first version as true while convicting Paylor of being a felon\nin possession of a firearm, then presented the second version as true while\nprosecuting a corrupt police detective who had arrested Paylor.\n\n### Get Our Top Investigations\n\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nThanks for signing up.

When Paylor later challenged\nhis conviction, the use of conflicting theories by the U.S. Department of\nJustice did not sit well with a judge on the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of\nAppeals.\n\n\u201cWhich is the truth?\u201d the judge, Stephanie Thacker, asked an assistant U.S.\nattorney during oral argument in 2021.\n\n\u201cDoes the government not share at least my concern that the government has\ntalked out of both sides of its mouth on this case?\u201d she asked the prosecutor.\n\nThe case of Keyon Paylor \u2014 in which the 4th Circuit appeals court issued a\nstrikingly blunt opinion two months ago \u2014 is but another in a string of cases\nin which prosecutors offer one version of the truth while trying one person,\nthen offer a very different version while trying another person.\n\nI wrote about contradictory prosecutions in 2017, and this ruling and others\nsuggest the practice has not abated.\n\nIn U.S. v. Driggers, a case involving guns stolen from a train in Chicago, the\ndefendant, Nathan Driggers, was convicted of being a felon in possession of a\nfirearm. When prosecuting a co-defendant named Warren Gates, the federal\ngovernment contended Gates bought guns from the train robbery from two other\nmen. But in trying Driggers, the government contended Gates bought them from\nDriggers.\n\nConfused? You are, again, not alone. The government denied using conflicting\ntheories, but the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals wasn\u2019t persuaded. In a\n2019 opinion, it wrote, \u201cThe government has not explained to us (or to anyone\nelse) how these two conflicting factual representations can coexist, and we\nare at a loss to reconcile them.\u201d Still, the court upheld Driggers\u2019\nconviction.\n\nIn the cases I found previously, prosecutors presented shifting theories on\nwhich defendant stabbed someone, or chopped someone\u2019s skull, or held someone\u2019s\nhead underwater. Most cases involved a gun: Prosecutors would say one\ndefendant fired a fatal shot, then, in a separate trial, before a different\ntrier of fact, say a different defendant fired it.\n\nIn 2009, in Lynn, Massachusetts, a state prosecutor argued that Bonrad Sok\nfired the single shot that killed a man outside a restaurant; six months\nlater, in a separate trial, the same prosecutor said the shooter was actually\nKevin Keo. Both men were convicted.\n\nSometimes, prosecutors offered not two versions of the truth, but three. In\nStuart, Florida, a convenience store clerk was shot and killed in 1982. In a\nfirst trial, the prosecution argued John Earl Bush was the shooter; at a\nsecond trial, it argued Alphonso Cave was the shooter; at a third trial, it\nargued J.B. Parker was the shooter. All three men were convicted and sentenced\nto death. Bush was executed in 1996. Cave died last year while still on death\nrow. Parker\u2019s sentence last year was reduced to life, for reasons unrelated to\nthe prosecution\u2019s contradictory positions.\n\nAt least 29 men have been sentenced to death in the U.S. since the 1970s in\ncases where prosecutors were accused of presenting competing versions of the\ntruth, from what I found searching legal cases. When prosecutors change their\nversion of who did what, it can lead to more serious charges or harsher\nsentences for more people. But as one federal judge wrote in a capital case,\n\u201cSuch actions reduce criminal trials to mere gamesmanship and rob them of\ntheir supposed purpose of a search for truth.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has never ruled squarely on whether conflicting\nprosecution theories violate due process. Lower courts are divided. In a\nhandful of cases, a court has overturned a conviction or a death sentence,\nfinding the prosecution\u2019s contradictory stances to be fundamentally unfair.\nBut more often than not, courts have allowed the tactic, even as many have\ndescribed it as unseemly or worse.\n\nJurors seem more taken aback by the conduct than many judges. For the 2017\narticle, I called a juror in a Missouri case in which the jury had convicted\nthe defendant of being the second of two robbers in a fatal robbery. When I\ntold her that the same prosecutor had argued, just two weeks before, in a\nseparate trial, that the second robber was someone else, she gasped. \u201cI think\nour justice system should actually be justice,\u201d she said. Later, as we kept\ntalking, she was so shaken that she began to cry.\n\n### The Prosecution\u2019s First Version of the Truth\n\nIn January 2014, four Baltimore police officers arrested Paylor. One of the\nofficers was Detective Daniel Hersl.\n\nHersl wrote up an incident report and probable cause statement, saying this is\nwhat happened:\n\nThe four officers were in an unmarked police car. They saw Paylor walking.\nWhen Paylor noticed the officers, he fled down the street. The officers\nfollowed in their car and saw Paylor arrive at his front porch, where he\nremoved what appeared to be a black handgun from his waistband and put it\nunder a chair cushion. Police lifted the cushion and found a loaded handgun.\n\nPaylor, 22 at the time, had prior convictions on gun and drug charges,\naccording to court records. After this arrest, he was indicted by a federal\ngrand jury on a charge of illegal possession of a firearm by a felon.\n\nPaylor\u2019s version of what happened differs from Hersl\u2019s. According to a brief\nfiled by Paylor\u2019s current lawyers, Paylor was simply walking home. When the\npolice detained him in his home\u2019s downstairs, one officer went upstairs and\nstole thousands of dollars from a bedroom dresser. Police planted the gun on\nhis porch and framed him, Paylor said. After his arrest, he called relatives\nfrom a jail phone; in recorded conversations, he denied the gun was his,\nclaimed the police stole his money and said, \u201cHersl plays a dirty game.\u201d\n\nAt that point, Hersl had dozens of misconduct complaints and had been sued\nmultiple times, according to court records. He was so notorious that in 2014,\nYoung Moose, a Baltimore rapper, called Hersl out by name in his song \u201cFuck\nThe Police.\u201d (In a first-person account, D. Watkins, a University of Baltimore\nprofessor, would later call Hersl \u201carguably the most hated cop in Baltimore.\u201d)\n\nPaylor\u2019s attorney, hoping to use Hersl\u2019s history to discredit him, asked for\nevery internal affairs department file in which Hersl had been accused of\nmisconduct. Prosecutors turned over 30 files to the judge, who, in turn,\nallowed Paylor\u2019s attorney to see only four of them and part of another,\naccording to court records. Paylor\u2019s attorney believed that provided too\nlittle ammunition to impeach Hersl and suggested Paylor plead guilty.\\\n\nThe federal gun charge carried a maximum sentence of 10 years. Paylor was also\naccused of violating probation on a state charge, for which he was looking at\nanother 15 years.\n\nThe government offered Paylor a deal: plead guilty and get five years on the\nfederal charge and time served on the state charge.\n\nPaylor took the deal \u2014 and at a hearing in 2015, the Justice Department\npresented its first version of the truth in this case.\n\nPeter J. Martinez, an assistant U.S. attorney, appeared on behalf of the\ngovernment. Asked by the judge for a summary of the facts, Martinez adopted\nHersl\u2019s version of events. He said if this case had gone to trial, the\ngovernment would have proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the gun was\nPaylor\u2019s and that he had tried to hide it from the police.\n\n### The Prosecution\u2019s Second Version of the Truth\n\nIn 2015, the same year Paylor pleaded guilty, the FBI was investigating\npossible corruption within the Baltimore Police Department. The investigators\neventually focused on a special unit called the Gun Trace Task Force. Task\nforce officers, the federal investigation would show, were robbing people,\nmany of them drug dealers who were unlikely to complain \u2014 and unlikely to be\nbelieved, if they did.\n\nOfficers were stealing money and planting evidence, the very sorts of behavior\nalleged by Paylor. \u201cThey were, simply put, both cops and robbers at the same\ntime,\u201d a federal prosecutor would say in court.\n\nHersl joined that task force in 2016 and became a key suspect.\n\nIn March 2017, the FBI arrested Hersl and six other task force officers on\nfederal racketeering charges. (Another task force member would later be\narrested, bringing the total to eight.)\n\nThe investigation continued after the initial arrests. Investigators listened\nto recorded phone calls made from jail by people arrested by Hersl and other\ntask force members \u2014 and came across the calls made by Paylor.\n\nThe federal prosecutors handling this case were Leo Wise and Derek Hines.\n\nWise wrote a book about the case, \u201cWho Speaks for You? The Inside Story of the\nProsecutor Who Took Down Baltimore\u2019s Most Crooked Cops.\u201d \u201cThis is a story of\nbelief and disbelief, of how I came to believe that the Task Force\u2019s victims\nwere telling the truth and the police officers were lying,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn the book, Wise wrote of how the recorded jail calls helped corroborate\naccounts that might otherwise be dismissed: \u201cThe jail calls were like time\ncapsules; they told us what had happened and when it happened. If we ever got\nto trial, they could also help us convince a jury that the victims weren\u2019t\nlying.\u201d\n\nIn June 2017, Hines and FBI agents met with Paylor, according to court\nrecords. Paylor reiterated what he\u2019d said in those calls, that he was\ninnocent. Hines then put Paylor before a grand jury, where the Justice\nDepartment presented its second version of the truth in this case.\n\nPaylor, under oath, testified that police framed him, planting the gun.\n\nThe Justice Department didn\u2019t charge Hersl in connection with the Paylor case,\nbut it did file a motion asking that Paylor\u2019s sentence be reduced, saying\nPaylor had \u201cprovided substantial assistance to the government.\u201d Paylor turned\ndown the offer, telling his lawyer that \u201cthe risk of retaliation by the police\nwas too high\u201d if he went through with the motion, according to court records.\n\n### \u201cThere Cannot Be Two Sides to the Truth\u201d\n\nHersl was convicted of racketeering offenses in February 2018 and sentenced to\n18 years. Seven other members of the Gun Trace Task Force were also convicted.\nIn the fallout, charges were dropped or convictions vacated in more than 800\ncases the officers had handled, because their word could not be trusted.\n\nThe extent of the police misconduct was so great that the Baltimore city\ncomptroller created a settlement tracker \u201cto memorialize the devastating\nimpact of the Gun Trace Task Force on our City.\u201d To date, the city has settled\n41 lawsuits for nearly $23 million, according to the tracker. Hersl was\ninvolved in 10 of those settled cases, the tracker says. Justin Fenton, a\nreporter now with the Baltimore Banner, wrote a book about the scandal, \u201cWe\nOwn This City,\u201d which was the basis for an HBO miniseries with the same name.\nFenton has also written about the Paylor case.\n\nIn March 2018 \u2014 one month after Hersl was convicted \u2014 Paylor filed a motion\nasking that his own conviction be vacated. The Justice Department opposed\nPaylor\u2019s request, and in 2019, a U.S. District Court judge denied the motion.\n\nThe case then went to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where one of the\nissues was whether the federal government could contradict itself: Should the\ngovernment be allowed to defend Paylor\u2019s conviction after having presented\nhim, to a grand jury, as a victim of a corrupt police officer?\n\nAt the 2021 oral argument, conducted by video conference because of the\npandemic, Paylor\u2019s lawyer was Debra Loevy, executive director of the\nExoneration Project, a free legal clinic whose staff represents people they\nbelieve were wrongfully convicted. Loevy told the court that the government\nvouched for Paylor while going after the police, \u201cand then they threw him\nunder the bus.\u201d\n\nThe lawyer representing the federal government was Martinez, the same\nprosecutor who had helped secure Paylor\u2019s conviction.\n\n\u201cLet me ask you this,\u201d Judge Thacker, who had previously been a federal\nprosecutor herself, said to Martinez. \u201cIn the government\u2019s view, was Mr.\nPaylor\u2019s testimony at his plea hearing the truth, or was his testimony at the\ngrand jury, that the government put on, the truth?\u201d\n\n\u201cVery much the former, your Honor,\u201d Martinez said.\n\n\u201cSo the government put on testimony in the grand jury that was not truthful?\u201d\nThacker said.\n\nMartinez wouldn\u2019t give a yes or no. He said prosecutors put Paylor before the\ngrand jury immediately after investigators interviewed him.\n\nThe judge pressed. \u201cThey can\u2019t both be true,\u201d she said of the two accounts.\n\n\u201cHis sworn admission of guilt is the truth. His grand jury testimony is\nfalse,\u201d Martinez said.\n\n\u201cAll right, all right, so then the government did suborn perjury in the grand\njury?\u201d the judge said.\n\nAgain, Martinez avoided a yes or no. Instead, he said that while prosecutors\ncan\u2019t knowingly present perjured testimony, the grand jury \u201cis an\ninvestigative tool,\u201d and prosecutors often put witnesses in the grand jury\nwhile still vetting their reliability.\n\nBut Paylor had pleaded guilty, the judge said. And the government knew that.\n\u201cSo the government had to think that what he was saying in the grand jury was\ntrue, and what he said at the plea hearing was not true,\u201d Thacker said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to speak to the mental state of the prosecutor who put Paylor\nin the grand jury,\u201d Martinez said.\n\nThe judge asked Martinez, \u201cThe government didn\u2019t feel an obligation to get to\nthe truth before it put somebody in the grand jury, under oath, to say\nsomething completely opposed to what he had pled guilty to?\u201d\n\nIn the back-and-forth, Martinez said that after Paylor\u2019s grand jury testimony,\nthe government further investigated Paylor\u2019s claim of being framed and\nconcluded it was false. And ultimately, Martinez said, Paylor\u2019s claim wasn\u2019t\nused in any charge against Hersl or mentioned in Hersl\u2019s trial or sentencing.\n(Loevy, Paylor\u2019s attorney, disputed that the government\u2019s subsequent\ninvestigation undermined Paylor\u2019s claim of innocence.)\n\nThacker had few kind words for the government, saying it \u201chasn\u2019t been the best\njudge of who\u2019s telling the truth in this case.\u201d\n\nLoevy, in a recent interview, said, \u201cI don\u2019t recall ever having an argument\nlike that \u2014 where the court was that vocally angry at one side\u2019s position.\u201d\n\nTwo months ago, the three-judge panel issued a unanimous opinion, written by\nThacker.\n\nThe court didn\u2019t vacate Paylor\u2019s conviction, but for Paylor\u2019s lawyers, it did\nthe next best thing. The court\u2019s ruling returned the case to a lower court for\na hearing at which Paylor\u2019s attorneys will have the chance to present evidence\nof the breadth of Hersl\u2019s misconduct, particularly any instances that preceded\nPaylor\u2019s guilty plea. The ruling authorized Paylor\u2019s attorneys to conduct\ndiscovery, meaning they can now have access to records they were previously\ndenied; plus, they can depose Hersl, asking him questions under oath.\n\n\u201cThis case presents the extraordinary circumstance in which the Government has\ntaken antithetical stances supporting two completely different versions of the\ntruth relative to Appellant\u2019s offense of conviction,\u201d Thacker wrote. \u201cBut,\nthere cannot be two sides to the truth. The truth is the truth.\u201d\n\nThe judge wrote: \u201cThe Government\u2019s two-faced positions and contrary statements\nbefore the court are clearly at odds with the notion of justice.\u201d\n\n### \u201cThanks!\u201d\n\nI wanted to ask the various prosecutors in this matter about the 4th Circuit\u2019s\nopinion lambasting the government.\n\nI emailed Martinez, who left the Department of Justice and now works for a\nlarge law firm. He emailed back, saying: \u201cAs I understand the relevant DOJ\nregulations, I am prohibited from speaking with you, absent authorization,\nregarding the work I did in the United States Attorney\u2019s Office.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department separately sent me an email, saying, \u201cWe are not\ncommenting on this case, nor are we authorizing Mr. Martinez to comment.\u201d Can\nI speak with Derek Hines and Leo Wise? I wrote back. \u201cDepartment guidelines\ngenerally prohibit commenting on pending cases, therefore Wise and Hines are\nnot authorized to sit for an interview. Thanks!\u201d the Justice Department\nresponded.\n\nWise and Hines are both now working on the DOJ team prosecuting Hunter Biden,\nthe president\u2019s son, on gun and tax charges.\n\nHersl asked last fall to be released early from prison on grounds of\ncompassion. An emergency motion said Hersl has been diagnosed with metastatic\nprostate cancer; a doctor, in September, wrote that Hersl\u2019s life expectancy is\nless than 18 months. The DOJ opposed the motion \u2014 noting, among other things,\nthat Hersl has shown no remorse, continuing to maintain his innocence \u2014 and a\njudge denied Hersl\u2019s request.\n\nHersl was represented at his trial by William Purpura. Purpura, in an\ninterview with ProPublica, said he once asked Hersl if he ever planted a gun\non anyone. Hersl laughed, according to Purpura, and said no, that in Baltimore\nthere\u2019s no need to put a gun on someone.\n\nIn 2021, while this appeal was pending, Paylor pleaded guilty to a state\nrobbery charge and was returned to prison. He got back out in December.\n\nRead More\n\nI Got Mailers Promoting Toddler Milk for My Children. I Went on to Investigate\nInternational Formula Marketing.\n\nPaylor was released from prison last month, after serving time in a robbery\ncase. Before that, he had already served his sentence on the gun charge\ninvolving Hersl. I asked Gayle Horn, another of Paylor\u2019s lawyers, why they\nkeep fighting that 2015 conviction, and she said, \u201cWe\u2019d like to see justice be\ndone.\u201d\n\nPaylor, asked the same question, said: \u201cBecause from day one, I\u2019ve been\ntelling people I was innocent.\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019m just trying to clear my name.\u201d\n\nDo You Have a Tip for ProPublica?
