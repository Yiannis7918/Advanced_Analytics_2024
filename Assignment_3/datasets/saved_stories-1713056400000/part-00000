Robin Conkel-hAnnan\n\nJuly 21, 2019 at 7:38 pm\n\nI am skeptical of studies that include such a small percentage of the\npopulation, 30,000 out of millions.. How can a natural diet be unhealthy.?\nExperts keep reversing what they have told us in the past.. My husbands family\nhas a history of heart disease.. In 1978 he had tests done that said he was\nnot in need of surgical intervention.. His cholesterol was high but his\narteries were clear.. I followed their guidelines scrupulously.. He gave up\nhis favorite foods hoping to live long enough to see our children grown.. When\nhe died, less than two years later, the coroner said his arteries were closed\ndown to pin-head size.. He gave up his favorite foods and still died.. Since\nthen I feed myself and my family the foods that our ancestors ate.. That\nincludes meat, fat, dairy and eggs.. Our children are now middle-aged, older\nthan many of their family who died young.. They are in good health with good\ncholesterol levels..\n\n  6. Tom Underwood\n\nJuly 21, 2019 at 3:25 pm\n\nScientist can find anything they want and prove that it is bad for people, but\nwhen it comes to finding what is best to use for any given illness, guess\nwhat, getting ten scientist to agree on that subject is a million to one shot.\nPeople live until their expiration date, which becomes part of their lives\nwhen they are born. The fact that scientist cannot grantee how long any one\nwill live proves that fact. The best statement they can come up with is;\n\u201cpeople will live until they die!\u201d However, some people are cut off from life\nthrough abortions, but they should know that was not in God\u2019s plan where\nlength of life is concerned. Life begins at conception whether people like it\nor not. It appears to me that most people believe that life is on some kind of\nauto-pilot, or something similar, but the Bible makes it clear that is not the\ntruth. What does that book say?\n\nPsalm 104:27-30; \u201cThese wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their\nmeat in due season. That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine\nhand, they are filled with good. Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou\ntakest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust. Thou sendest\nforth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.\n\nThe entire dependence of this immense family on God is set forth from\ncreatures in the sea. With Him, to kill or make alive is equally easy. To hide\nHis face is to withdraw favor (Psalms 13:1). By His spirit, or breath, or mere\nword, He gives life. It is His constant providence which repairs the wastes of\ntime and disease. However, while God can equally glorify His power in\ndestruction, in His severity He can give death as easily as He gives life in\npreservation of His goodness and mercy, so that we may well spend our lives in\ngrateful praise, honoring to Him, and delightful to pious hearts (Psalms\n147:1). Paul tells us these things through his epistle to the Romans 11:22;\n\u201cBehold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell,\nseverity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness:\notherwise thou also shalt be cut off.\u201d\n\n    1. John Thompson\n\nJuly 21, 2019 at 5:19 pm\n\nI am a Christian and so agree with the things that you have written, although\nI am confused about your applying this broad of a brush to the specific\ncontext of healthy eating. So with that as a baseline . . .\n\nThere is one point on which I will disagree, namely\n\n\u201cPeople live until their expiration date, which becomes part of their lives\nwhen they are born.\u201d Really? Based on what other than you saying it?\n\nAny time I hear an extreme statement like this, I immediately question its\nvalidity. If there were truly an \u201cexpiration date\u201d, then it would have very\nfew component causes, such as death by disease or old age. Your statement\nincludes every other causal effect as something set at birth that ultimately\nresults in our expiration on a specific and lethal date. Nothing could be\nfurther from the truth.\n\nFor example, take the case of someone who smoked from an early age, acquired\nlung cancer and died decades before when they would have died had they never\nsmoked. Is that behavior programmed at birth? Were they unwilling accomplices\nin bringing about their demise on their expiration date, or did they make a\npoor choice and pay the price. Or is rampant obesity \u2013 the backdrop of this\narticle \u2013 an overwhelming tool of fate that seals the doom of millions because\nthey must die on their expiration date?\n\nWhat about the 70,000-odd people who have died each of the last several years\nbecause of opioid addiction \u2013 either purposeful or accidental? Or what of the\nperson killed by the drunk driver? On the subject of car accidents, what about\nthe young person who died after being struck by someone running the red light,\na death mainly caused by just not looking before entering the intersection? Or\nwhat about someone who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time,\nlike tourists killed in the tsunami events in the Far East in 2004? Or, for\nthat matter, what of the countless number of people killed world-wide every\nyear by Mother Earth with typhoons, tornadoes, rain/floods, lightning strikes,\nexposure, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, etc? Many people who die are,\nmetaphorically speaking, just drive-by shooting victims. Yet you have lumped\nall together in your better-felt-than-known pronouncement of this \u201cExpiration\nDate\u201d theory.\n\nThe industrial revolution has certainly added huge number of causal deaths in\nits wake along with immeasurable benefits, one of them being extending\nlifespans. How does that fit into your thesis? There would be no death by\nelectrocution, airplane / car / train crashes, building and bridge collapses,\nrocket launches and on and on if we still lived in the stone age. But if we\ndid live in the stone age, neither would there be induced immunity from\ninfectious diseases, or life-saving surgeries, or vastly decreased infant\nmortality, although there would be people dying en masse from polluted water\nand poor sanitary conditions, food poisoning due to no refrigeration, heat\nexhaustion due to lack of air conditioning, being kicked by a mule while\nplowing, ad infinitum.\n\nTo use your terminology, there certainly is something that hastens one\u2019s\nexpiration date and that something is stupidity. The death-and-injury\noccurrence of young male drivers along with their high insurance rates is\nample proof of that.\n\nHere\u2019s another extreme statement that is broadcast as if it came from God\nHimself \u2013 \u201cEverything happens for a reason\u201d. That usually is quoted when\nsomething bad happens and we the search has begun for a silver lining.\nStupidity is a big reason for bad things happening. The problem is that most\npeople don\u2019t want to own their own mistakes. It is far easier to say that \u201cthe\nuniverse is doing this to me\u201d than to just say I messed up and now am bearing\nthe pain for it. I have done some stupid things in my life, and have the scars\nto prove it. I own them all.\n\nIn the metaphorical sense, we all certainly do have an expiration date as far\nas being mortal. To say that each of us has a date on which we will die and no\none has any power over that date is foolish indeed.\n\n      1. chris parodi\n\nJuly 21, 2019 at 11:49 pm\n\nI would have to assume that he is a believer in the notion that God has a plan\nfor each and every one of us the moment we are conceived. My only issue with\nthat is if we are including outside extremities as \u201cGod\u2019s Plan\u201d, wouldn\u2019t we\nhave to include a terminated pregnancy in that grouping as well? I was born\nand raised Catholic. I am non-practicing, yet do not believe in abortion\nneither. I do not on the other-hand feel that our destiny is written at\nconception, and from what I can recall from 12 years of catholic schooling,\nneither does the church. I believe the teaching is that, while god does have\n\u201cplans\u201d per say, for each of us, it is up to us to live out this \u201cplan\u201d. But,\nit is by no means a pre-recorded outcome. But yea, why this discussion was\nstarted in an article about my favorite breakfast item is beyond me.\n\n      2. Joe\n\nJuly 22, 2019 at 2:22 am\n\nYou misunderstood the sentence. It just meant each of us will eventually die.\nIt isn\u2019t actually saying our date of death is predetermined.\n\n    2. Terry\n\nJuly 21, 2019 at 10:39 pm\n\nLife Begins At Breath. Abortion is a made up issue designed to coalesce a\nright-wing political movement. It isn\u2019t even mentioned in the Bible unless you\nconsider the obvious implications of the ordeal of the bitter water in Numbers\n5. Everyone has a right to make their own decisions about abortion and we\nbelieve if someone is against it they shouldn\u2019t have one. No one has the right\nto impose their beliefs on this topic on others, especially when right-wing\nBiblical interpretations are fabricated for political purposes. Genesis 2:7,\nHe \u201cbreathed into his nostrils the breath of life and it was then that the man\nbecame a living being.\u201d You need to get a grip brother, you losing it, right\nwing alternativechristians are spending billions of dollars a year on an anti\nabortion message. Just imagine if they spent that on the already living, for\nclean water, safe housing, better birthing practices, etc. Now please do me a\nfavor. Since what we eat has nothing to do with how long we live, please come\nfour cups of these night shade berries from out back of the barn and cook\nyourself up a divine little pie, sweeten it with honey and make a nice sugar\ncrust!! Trust in God that all his fruit is good, and it is only an expiration\ndate that will take you out. Peace and Love. You rationale is inspired by an\nindoctrination of hate and division, and it is very odd you feel such a need\nto THROW UP the abortion issue every single time you blog. Glory\n\n    3. noland dumond\n\nJuly 21, 2019 at 11:58 pm\n\nI have know knowledge about bacon and what it can or cannot do to you, not a\nfan. I am a seventy year old man and I can tell you I have eaten 2 egg every\nday most of my life. Lets say the first 10 years of my life I did not eat eggs\nand take 1 more year off for not having eggs for breakfast here and there over\nthe 70 years. Now that leave 59 years of eating 2 eggs a day which work out to\n43,070. So you would think I should be dead after eating all those eggs and\nthat much cholesterol over the years. I have high blood pressure, high\ncholesterol, Diverticulitis, C.O.P.D, Asthma, Aortic Aneurysm, Arthritis,\nSacroiliac joint pain, Fibromyalgia, Angina and Diabetes. I also had carpal\ntunnel in both arms. Appendicitis twice, first time it burst, Bladder Cancer,\nA foot and a half of my bowel removed. I know your saying this guy is full of\nshit or he should be dead and I would agree but I\u2019m not, dead that is. I also\nhad a angioplasty procedure to check my heart. The heart specialist were\nabsolutely positive I had a heart attack. I was told my heart was as clean as\na new born baby. I wonder about the high cholesterol the doctor said I have.\nThe many doctors I have seen over the years said 2 egg a week is all you\nshould eat it is bad for cholesterol. So do I believe egg are keeping my heart\nclean you bet your ass. I believe all the doctors were wrong about eggs I am\nnot like the people they have study that can\u2019t remember whether or not they\nate eggs three days earlier. As I said earlier I am diabetic and I write\neverything down I eat and drink. So lady and gentlemen I would not take much\nstock in these scientific studies. There was a study done on cholesterol a few\nyears back. They found there are two kind, good and bad cholesterol. The study\nsaid eggs have good cholesterol that kills the bad cholesterol which is fatty\nmeats. I tend to believe there is good and bad cholesterol. I was not only an\negg eater I was a lover of fat, so the good cholesterol in eggs must kill the\nbad cholesterol in fatty meats or I believe I would be dead years ago.\n\n  7. Arnold Saenz\n\nJuly 21, 2019 at 3:17 pm\n\nAverage person produces about 2000 mg of cholesterol a day. Average chicken\negg has about 170 mg of cholesterol. If you eat 2 eggs in a given day your\nbody should produce 340 mg fewer mg of cholesterol because it tries to keep\ncholesterol levels constant, not too high nor too low. This is normal, but\nthere are people that are exceptions that fall towards extremes of normal\ncurve due to genetics or their own particular differences. So there isn\u2019t a\none-size-fits-all in that a large study will provide an answer to all. Also,\nyou might not know how scientifically thorough the study was performed. Best\nthing is do perform a sensitivity study of your own and see how consuming\nfoods with cholesterol affect you personally and that will show up with blood\nlab results. Some people might not have to change anything and others might\nneed to change foods, activity, other lifestyle changes. and/or take\nmedications to control cholesterol.\n\n  8.

Ari Maayan\n\nJuly 21, 2019 at 11:33 am\n\nMy great grandfather, a Mvskoke Creek Indian ate 6 eggs a day all his life and\ndied at the age of 100. He was never sick a day in his life.\n\n  11. Ari Maayan\n\nJuly 21, 2019 at 11:20 am\n\nMy great grandfather, a Mvskoke Creek Indian ate 6 eggs a day all his adult\nlife and lived to be 100 and was never sick a day of his life.\n\n  12. Max Fester\n\nJuly 21, 2019 at 10:50 am\n\nMy parents 89 and 90, and doing as well as expected. Dad has a number of\nissues due to Agent Orange exposure, but their outlook on eating their entire\nlife has been \u201cEverything in Moderation\u201d. And so, I view eating the same way.\nI dont avoid anything, but never over-indulge either.\n\n    1. Susan J Millis\n\nJuly 21, 2019 at 10:38 pm\n\nMax has it right! My grandmother passed on to me the same exact words:\n\u201cEverything in Moderation.\u201d She said the words and lived them AND she taught\nme how to cook and bake fabulous food, not to lie or be wasteful and how to\nsew beautiful clothes!\n\n  13. Jery\n\nJuly 21, 2019 at 9:12 am\n\nOne major problem with this study is that dietary cholesterol has been shown\nto have no effect on cholesterol found in our systems.\n\n    1. Bill\n\nJuly 21, 2019 at 10:56 pm\n\nDietary intake of cholesterol may have little or no effect on blood\ncholesterol levels. In my case this was true. With an extremely high blood\ncholesterol level my doctor recommended I go on a diet where all fats and\nproducts containing cholesterol were eliminated. After three months the effect\nwas close to zero, even despite me taking the highest dose of Lipitor, Statin\nbased cholesterol reducing drugs. Ironically, after reading a book titled the\n\u2018Atkins Diabetes Revolution\u2019 I changed my diet to the Atkins (anti diabetes)\ndiet. My physician said \u2018you have nothing to lose if you want to try a\ndifferent approach\u2019, which required me to eat more fats, proteins including\nplenty of eggs and other high cholesterol containing foods, while reducing to\na minimum carbohydrates, especially the common \u2018white\u2019 carbs found in rice,\nflour and white breads, sugar and potatoes. After three months my doctor was\namazed. Not only was my blood cholesterol normal (he took me off Lipitor), but\nmy blood pressure had also come down and I no longer required medication for\nelevated blood pressure, all my other blood analysis results were perfect. I\nhad lost about 5 Kg of body weight and felyt fitter than ever. I have now for\nover 15 years maintained a low carbs diet with no restriction on protein, fats\nor good carbs like green and red vegetables and reducing intake of sugar and\n\u2018bad white\u2019 carbs. My health remains excellent (I\u2019m now 78 years of age and\nstill doing the same things I used to do 25 years ago). So diets can work\ndifferently for different individuals. I ama good test case. But of course\nsome individuals would likely have a very different outcome to mine.\n\n  14. Mark\n\nJuly 21, 2019 at 2:47 am\n\nArguments persist regarding human ingestion of eggs but researchers using\nrabbits have long standing, indisputable ways of inducing atherosclerosis in\nrabbits by what they feed them. How this translates to humans remains\ndebatable. Plus, not all humans are alike. The same diet can produce\nsignificantly different levels of atherosclerosis in different individuals.\nNutrition is an infant science for sure IMO.\n\n    1. June\n\nJuly 21, 2019 at 1:31 pm\n\nThe problem with using rabbits in nutritional research is that they are\nobligate herbivores and therefore have no mechanism to deal with saturated\nfats found in animal products. It\u2019s like putting diesel in a standard car\nengine and concluding that diesel makes a terrible fuel and should be\noutlawed.\n\n  15. chris erb\n\nJuly 21, 2019 at 12:43 am\n\nThis has been the biggest shit show I\u2019ve ever read.\n\nHas anyone done a study on fertilized chicken eggs?\n\nAlso 150 year ago when bacon and eggs was a way to keep your heart lubricated,\nbut only if you could afford it. If you could afford bacon and eggs you\nprobably didn\u2019t get infection from cuts while shoveling horse shit.\n\nSo yes eggs are definitely good for you if you can afford them.\n\n    1. Rafa Oliana\n\nJuly 21, 2019 at 9:06 am\n\nIs there a diet to control rudeness?\n\n    2. Sam\n\nJuly 21, 2019 at 12:33 pm\n\nI agree with you that 150 years ago only the wealthy could afford to eat bacon\nand eggs on a regular basis. However, you say that eating bacon and eggs was a\nway to keep your heart lubricated. Why do you think that eating bacon and eggs\nkeeps your heart lubricated? You also say that eating bacon and eggs reduced\nthe likelihood that cuts would become infected. Why do you think that\nregularly eating bacon and eggs reduced the likelihood of infection?\n\n  16. PennieBenny\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 11:39 pm\n\nThank You ! Excellent work. Shut up nay sayer\u2019s. What work have YOU put in to\nthis study ? NONE.\n\n    1. Sam\n\nJuly 21, 2019 at 12:44 pm\n\nYou claim that if someone did not put any work into the study, then they have\nno right to criticize that study. That makes absolutely no sense. Suppose that\nsomeone writes an essay on how planet earth is as flat as a pancake, or an\nessay on how bacteria do not exist. Also, assume that you did not help them\nwrite that essay. You did not put any work yourself into the essay on how\nbacteria don\u2019t exist. That does not mean that your criticism of their essay in\nsomehow invalid. The study on eggs tracked participants\u2019 health outcomes for\nat least 13 years. Participants were asked about their diet only once, at the\nbeginning of the study. Lots of people change their diet. A lot of people\nprobably did not eat the same thing 10 years later as when the study was\nstarted. That a legitimate criticism, even if the critic never helped work on\nthe study.\n\n  17. Ken Marino\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 10:33 pm\n\nMy maternal grandfather, born in Italy, had a raw egg in a shot of whiskey\nmost mornings for breakfast and said it was an old world remedy for a long\nlife. He was extremely healthy till the last year of his life (died at 94). He\nseldom drank more than a glass of wine with dinner, otherwise.\n\n    1. George Bedell\n\nJuly 21, 2019 at 1:23 pm\n\nMy maternal step-grandfather, Fortunato, also from Italy, had the same egg and\nwhiskey routine as your grandfather did every morning. I recall in his later\nyears, Nona cracking a raw egg in a brandy glass for him every morning before\nhe went out to work in the family garden. (It was an immense garden.) He\nclaimed that his \u2018breakfast\u2019 was the secret behind his good health and\nlongevity. He could still climb trees in his seventies and lived to be 98. I\ntried this routine in my early twenties for three days. On the third day,\nwhile in a daze at my drafting table, it dawned on me that I was showing up to\nwork drunk. The experiment ended there. Now in my later years, I am thinking\nabout giving it another shot. Ken, thanks for rekindling the good memories!\n\nGeorge Bedell\n\n  18. Paul H\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 9:34 pm\n\nWhat I find funny is when people discuss weight loss or gain it\u2019a always food\nfault. How about sitting on the couch and binge watching mind numbing things.\nImagine if one of those hours these do-no-exercise humans got up and burned\nthese calories and increased their metabolism? How much discussion would we\nneed about diet?\n\n    1. Katherine\n\nJuly 21, 2019 at 1:56 pm\n\nSpeaking of the requirement to exercise for healthy and successful weight\nloss, a theory that is \u2018believed\u2019 by nearly everyone, I have found that\nexercise makes no difference whatsoever to weight loss while dieting. I lose\nweight well when I diet properly. I aim for 2 lbs a week and nearly always\nreach that. If I were to try to exercise (or move strenuously) enough to\nactually burn off enough calories to have an affect I would have to do SO much\nof that that I\u2019d have to quit many or some of the things I do daily that are\npart important parts of my life. I have never ever seen any difference in\nweight loss when I am more active vs less. I read a study a few years ago that\nstated clearly that activity level, described as \u2018exercise\u2019, made no\ndifference in weight loss. Since I already believed that, I believed the study\nfindings. My point is that perhaps for some people exercise can affect weight\nloss (and metabolism) but it certainly does NOT affect ALL people, and I am\none example of that. I am healthy and slim. I diet successfully. I do it all\nas I move normally doing normal things that are NOT considered strenuous or\nathletic. I don\u2019t like to sweat and refuse to deliberately impose that upon\nmyself. So, I wish that the athletic people would recognize that bodies are\nALL different and that their method is not necessarily the right thing for\nothers.\n\n      1. Michael Hoffman\n\nJuly 21, 2019 at 5:15 pm\n\nPerhaps exercise is less important for weight loss, though I would argue that\na certain amount would contribute to a certain degree, exercise is very\nimportant for overall health. Keeping your weight under control is important,\nbut keeping fit is equally if not more important. Wouldn\u2019t you agree?\n\n  19. Ric\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 9:08 pm\n\nEggs as a source of protein are cheaply available and best of all they are\nportion controlled. Arguably in the western world\u2019s over-large portions and\nlack of fiber are our #1 and #2 problems (unless you want to count lack of\nexercise). At only 70 calories for a large egg, eggs are great. I\u2019m 53 and my\ncholesterol always comes in low. Any food study should account for how eggs\nare cooked (fried anything is less healthy). It should also account for what\nis eaten with it\u2013as much as I like bacon or sausage, bacon and sausage are\nprocessed foods (usually fried). Instead of telling people not to eat eggs, we\nwould be better off to tell people to cut (or cut back on) processed\nfoods\u2013such as bacon. Also, we should reconsider how we eat our 1 or 2 eggs. If\nwe have one egg on toast\u2013get the 3 grams of fiber, 60 calorie bread. If we eat\ntwo eggs\u2013because we are really hungry\u2013then we should be putting our eggs in a\nsalad or scrambling our eggs in a cooked cabbage/carrots/kale salad bowl so\nthat we get the daily recommended amount of fiber. Then afterwards, go for a\nwalk.\n\n  20.

It\u2019s\nmy experience that you can eat a whole pizza and not even know it if you are\nengrossed in a television program, and the ads on the program generally are\ndesigned to make you want to eat even more. A corollary to this \u201cno television\nwhile eating\u201d rule is that meals eaten in the car should be limited.

Kim Hargan\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 7:35 pm\n\nIn response to IMissLiberty, the biological sciences suffer from trying to\nemulate the physical sciences, which include a precept of \u201cuniversality\u201d in\ntheir way of doing science. That is, if pure water freezes at 0 degrees\nCentigrade at sea level in Canada, then it will also freeze under the same\nconditions in China. And a water molecule will always consist of two atoms of\nhydrogen and one atom of oxygen. And we have Newton\u2019s \u201cLaws\u201d of motion and the\n\u201cLaws\u201d of thermodynamics. Unfortunately, biological systems are much more\ncomplex than simple physical systems, and with each passing year we discover\nnew layers of complexity in biological systems (epigenetics, anyone?). So,\nalthough your point makes perfect sense, biological scientists are likely to\ncontinue to search for \u201cuniversals\u201d, often running roughshod over genetic\ndiversity as well as over all the factors that play into genetic expression\n(the aforementioned epigenetics). Even with your minority immune system, an\nidentical twin separated from you at birth but raised in radically different\nconditions (tropical or arctic climate, nasty pollution from nearby\nindustries, different diet with perhaps certain deficiencies, etc.) could end\nup with sufficiently different metabolic processes that good advice for you\nmight be bad advice for the other, and vice versa. But of course that would\nrun counter to the ideal of discovering biological \u201cuniversals\u201d equivalent to\nthe universals of the physical sciences.\n\nAs just another example (in addition to my previous post), much of Africa is\ntropical, and most of its soils are geologically ancient, meaning that a\nnumber of compounds, such as salts, have been washed out. As a result, most\nAfricans have metabolic mechanisms that conserve sodium (from common salt)\nwhich would otherwise be lost through perspiration. (Sodium is necessary for a\nnumber of processes, including the ion exchange involved in messages\ntraversing our nerves.) However, excess sodium can contribute to hypertension\n(high blood pressure), so people of African heritage come under a health\nthreat when salt, which was scarce in their ancestral environment, is not only\nfreely available in massive amounts, but is likewise massively added to most\nprocessed foods in modern America. The Danes, on the other hand, in their past\ndid a lot of fishing and ate copious amounts of cod and herring harvested from\nthe sea. To this day, they like their food much saltier than I care for,\nincluding a popular brand of licorice, which was a bit of a shock to me the\nfirst time I tried a piece of it. So advice on a \u201cnormal\u201d amount of salt\nintake for a Dane might actually be dangerously unhealthy for a person of\nAfrican descent. Researchers looking to discover a biological \u201cuniversal\u201d in\nthat regard are going to be way off base if their study pool contains too much\nof one genotype or another, and their \u201cuniversal\u201d will essentially be\nmeaningless.\n\nAnd referring to my earlier post, the Mediterranean diet would probably be\nunhealthy for Inuit, leading to various metabolic disorders, while a healthy\nInuit diet would probably give the majority of Mediterranean people heart\nattacks in short order. A true science of nutrition is going to have to be\nhighly personalized, and we are so very far away from that now \u2014 and will\nremain so as long as researchers continue to be fixated on discovering\n\u201cuniversals\u201d instead of focusing on the wide variety of metabolic paths\nwritten in our genes.\n\n    1. Ralph\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 10:48 pm\n\nFirst and foremost. ALL health sciences, and biologic sciences are based on\nthe two physical sciences. If you don\u2019t understand the fundamental principles\nof chemistry and physics you understand nothing about biology. Health sciences\nare based on the information and fundamental research that is attributed to\nchemistry and physics. The failure of individuals in these professions to\ntruly understand chemical reactions, quantum mechanics and numerous other\ntopics makes them inadequate and sometimes incompetent doctors, nurses,\ndieticians etc. Most of what medical doctors do is prescribe medication. Their\nlack of understanding of the pharmacodynamics , pharmacokinetics and\ndetoxification chemistry of these drugs put patients at risk. Studies are\nsimply anecdotal. Research takes years to understand the chemistry of how the\nmolecules of living systems works. Unfortunately the public is mostly unaware\nof this huge difference. They will latch on to any study that the media puts\nforward. I am not saying that you should not see a doctor when you are ill or\nhave a disease. I am saying that medical doctors are not scientists and before\nprescribing any medication the absolutely should dig into the science of those\nmolecules.\n\n      1. Sam\n\nJuly 21, 2019 at 1:15 pm\n\nYou wrote, that the failure of those in the health sciences to truly\nunderstand quantum mechanics, amoung other topics, makes for inadequate and\nsometimes incompetent doctors, nurses, dieticians etc. The field of quantum\nmechanics is useful for describing the behavior of stuff at the heart of a\nstar, inside of a nuclear reactor, where atoms are being smashed together\nunder extreme heat and pressure. However, human beings cannot live under those\nconditions. Quantum mechanics is not necessary for understanding the kind of\nchemistry where atoms almost never gain or lose protons. knowledge of quantum\nmechanics is not at all useful for understanding pharmaceutical drugs. This is\nbecause the atoms inside of a drug molecule and the atoms inside of a person\u2019s\nbody aren\u2019t splitting or fusing, gain or losing protons. Additionally, if\nmedical doctors were required to be experts in physics and chemistry, there\nwould be a shortage of people to give you a plaster cast when you broke your\nleg, or prescribe an antibiotic when you had a sinus infection. Consider the\nfollowing: You do not have to understand the physics behind and internal\ncombustion engine in order to be an excellent car driver. Doctors only need to\nknow how to use the pedals; how and when to turn the steering wheel etc...\nThey do not actually have to have intimate knowledge of every single little\ndetail of a car\u2019s inner workings in order to be excellent drivers.\n\n      2. JOHN WALKER\n\nJuly 21, 2019 at 11:59 pm\n\nSo many comments, so much ignorance and misguided opinion? The irony! It\u2019s a\nscience site not a biblical rant site, and not an anecdotal heresay site \u2013 so\nstick to those if you feel you need to make silly comments?\n\nMost people have zero understanding of scientific method or statistical\nanalysis, preferring to follow a superstition like religion or some internet\nguru touting ridiculous rubbish, then claim it makes them super healthy or\nsaved their life, whatever.\n\nThey are the most surprised when diagnosed with a disease or cancer \u2013 as if\nanything can give any of us perfect health and immortality!

The biological sciences \u2013 mainly medical doctors love to pigeon hole\neveryone into one type. The only problem with that is that we are physically\ndifferent and so one drug or treatment may work on one person but not on\nanother. My body is nearly immune to pain killers, and I always get a smug\nsmile from doctors when I tell them this because their closed minds that\nlearned medicine from the 1960\u2019s in textbooks with data based on you guessed\nit statistics, told them that\u2019s\u2019 not possible. The best source of information\nany doctor has of how their patients\u2019 body works, is the patient themselves.\nBut hey, if a study done in 1980 on 100 people most likely from the same\ngenotype and socio-cultural background proved that something was \u201cthat way\u201d\nthen well it MUST be that way for the other 7 billion+ people of 2019 right? I\nmean really, only an idiot thinks nature is continually adapting and changing\nto its\u2019 environment right? Medical science needs to stop acting like it\u2019s a\nstatic science. Biology mutates, learns, adapts, changes to suit its\u2019\nenvironment, thus the human body does the same on an individual human scale.\nWe need to develop technology and mindsets that work on an individual human\nscale and stop just trying to do what\u2019s easy for big pharma to make money.\n\n      1.

Perhaps,\none day, there will be useful guidelines available to help us know how to eat\nwell to improve the quality and longevity of life.

Lord knows, you\u2019ll never\nfind Trump in a vegan restaurant.\n\nNo doubt eggs have some nutrients. But those are outweighed in matters of\nhealth by the poisonous saturated fats (animal proteins, also, are suspect,\nbut don\u2019t want to overload your brain). Dr. Kellogg and associates were on the\nright track with their cereal breakfasts, more motivated by public-spirited\nzeal than the profit motive.

Lindsey Martin-Bowen\n\nJuly 21, 2019 at 1:24 am\n\nWhen I was in junior high and high school, one of my girlfriends lived only a\nfew houses from me, and we spent time together daily as teenage girls often\ndo. Her father, whom I knew fairly well when my friend and I were in our\nteens, lived a healthy life, but died about two years ago at age 104 years.\n\nFrom spending the night with my friend and accompanying her family on trips to\nthe Lake of the Ozarks, I was able to see much of his usual diet, which was\nvery balanced. Many of his breakfasts comprised bacon and eggs, and he usually\nate vegetables, potatoes, bread, and meat daily. He drank coffee daily, was\nnever overweight, and stayed physically active\u2013at least, until he was beyond\n100 years old. (He may not have been as active during that final year of 104.\nI am unsure. I didn\u2019t see the family almost daily then.)\n\nIn short, although what we eat definitely affects our health, it is not the\nsole factor. Our activities, including not only work, but how we choose to\nspend our leisure time dramatically affect our health (and often life\nexpectancy\u2013depending upon other genetic factors), too. Thus, although such\nnutritional studies are fascinating\u2013and may often offer some valuable\ninformation to at least consider, they need not be taken too seriously.\n\n      2.

Wake up MEAT,\nDAIRY IS AND WILL ALWAYS BE DEATH.\u201d\u2014\u2014\n\nI am a bit embarrassed for you, but I realize you are just ignorant (meaning\nto be without knowledge or understanding of something). Don\u2019t be offended\nbecause we are ALL ignorant about many things. Here, I will briefly explain\nabout the mistakes in your statement -not to try to change your mind about\nwhether you should consume animal proteins, but just so you have a greater\nunderstanding.\n\nIn order for a laid egg to become an embryo, a hen must be inseminated by a\nrooster; the semen must find and penetrate the egg, thus fertilizing it; and\nthe laid egg must be incubated for a duration of time, and remain undamaged.\n\nThe contents of freshly laid, fertilized egg, if cracked open, still look just\nlike what one sees in an egg purchased from a market: a liquid white and yolk.\nIt is only after a number of days being incubated does that substance\ntransform and begin to resemble an embryo. To incubate basically means to keep\nsomething in a controlled environment, for a specific amount of time, at a\nspecific, usually warm, temperature. Hens achieve incubation by sitting on\ntheir eggs.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing about the vast majority of eggs produced for consumption:\nthey are not fertilized. Some people may be unknowingly eating fertilized egg\nbecause freshly laid eggs (fertilized or not) are typically either consumed\nimmediately or put into refrigeration. The refrigeration prevents the contents\ntransformation into an embryo, thus in either case, the person only sees a\nyolk and white. The likely scenario, though, is that those who consume\nfertilized eggs are fully aware because they seek them out, and the ones sold\nin grocery markets are clearly labeled as being fertilized. Hens (the female\nchickens) don\u2019t need to be inseminated in order to produce eggs, however. When\nthey reach a certain point of physiological maturity, they begin their egg-\nlaying cycles -much like human females when they begin their\novulation/menstruation cycle. Insemination and fertilization is not what\ninitiates it; the cycle happens regardless, in the cases of both creatures.\nThat\u2019s why a person can have a couple backyard chickens, without a rooster,\nand still get eggs.\n\nI hope this helps you, Anton.\n\nBest regards.\n\n      1. Esther Cleman\n\nJuly 21, 2019 at 12:59 pm\n\nI love this answer. It is very clear and precise, easy to understand, while\nnot being in the least condescending.

In which case, it is possible that the egg was\nfertilized. I spent time on my aunt and uncles farm summers when I was a girl\nand I was allowed to polish ( with sand paper) and candle eggs \u201c\u201d( hold it up\nto the light to see if you could find the sperm left by the Rooster). This was\nneeded to be done so the eggs could be sold. We got to eat the ones that were\nfertilized...guess my aunt just scooped out the sperm when she cracked the egg\ninto the bowl...will have to ask my cousin.

Kim Hargan\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 6:04 pm\n\nAnd now for a total monkey wrench to toss into the discussion. My degrees are\nin archaeology, and one of the graduate courses I took was a physical\nanthropology course on endocrinological differences between \u201craces\u201d. Now,\ncholesterol in and of itself is a chemical building block that the body uses\nin a number of biochemical processes. The body produces a certain amount on\nits own (after all, we are mammals), and gets the rest of what it needs from\nits diet. There are penalties to the body both for the presence of too much\ncholesterol as well as levels that are too low. But what is fascinating is\nthat various groups have apparently (I have to say apparently here because of\ncourse there is no fossil evidence to document the process) developed\ndifferent metabolic responses with regard to cholesterol. This is expressed in\nfasting serum cholesterol levels. The group that showed the lowest serum\ncholesterol levels on average were Inuit peoples. This makes perfect sense as\na response to their dietary environment, which included eating whale and seal\nblubber as well as using rendered blubber oils in their cooking. You would\nfigure any lineage whose metabolism would overload from disease-consequences\nof receiving so much external cholesterol would be eliminated from the gene\npool. The American Indians were the next in the ranking (also makes sense, as\nmany of them were hunter-gatherers or hunter-small scale farmers before the\narrival of the Europeans with their farming technology) and the list went on\nwith distinct differences between groups, appearing (again, a cautionary word\nhere) to correlate with the depth of their history of large-scale farming with\ncereal grains. There were also differences on how \u201cwell\u201d the body retained\nsodium (from salt), correlating with how close to or far from the equator a\npopulation had historically lived, as well as other sorts of things like\nvitamin D requirements (likewise correlatable with distance from the equator).\nSo a study that examined the metabolic effects of a certain level of\ncholesterol consumption could show significantly different results if the\nstudy group was all Eskimos as compared to a group of all Caucasians.\n\nSo, what does this mean? Groups of Homo sapiens each lived in much the same\nareas which had much the same seasonal variation providing much the same food\nsources for tens of thousands of years once the last Ice Age ended, and the\nevidence suggests (another cautionary word) that groups living in given\nenvironments adapted to a certain extent to the local conditions, including\nthe abundance or lack of certain nutrients. Only in the last ten thousand\nyears have we developed domestication of food plants and food animals for\nfarming and totally changed the human dietary environment with blazing speed\n(in geological and evolutionary terms) for those groups which turned to\nfarming in place of hunting and gathering. In other words, humanity has been\nconducting a massive dietary and nutritional experiment upon itself since the\ndevelopment of farming, as the technology changes so much faster than the\nhuman metabolism evolves. On top of that, over the last millennium or so\ngroups of humans have become more mobile and more engaged in trade of all\nsorts, including foodstuffs. That means more exposure to more foodstuffs and\nenvironments for which one\u2019s ancestral group was not adapted (or accustomed,\nif you prefer that), which only increases the complexity of the experiment we\nare running on ourselves. Movements of and therewith intermarriages between\ngroups only muddies the genetic factors governing metabolism further. In the\nend, this fairly destroys the ability to run a study and then to say\ndefinitively \u201cThis thing is 100% good for all humans and that other thing is\n100% bad for all humans\u201d (leaving out such universally needed things as oxygen\nor such universally toxic things as certain plant poisons, of course). We may\nsome day approach a true science of nutrition when we can tease out from a\nperson\u2019s genetic heritage what combination of things is best for each\nindividual metabolism; I would guess until science takes that into account we\nwill continue to get seesawing evaluations of various foods or diets because\nof the (sometimes wildly) varying reactions of the various genetic makeups of\nthe subjects participating in them.\n\nAnd now for an anecdotal case in point. My ancestry is mostly western\nEuropean, but I also have a reasonably recent Native American ancestor through\nthe maternal line \u2014 I have brown eyes, brown hair, tan easily, although my\npaternal grandmother was blonde, blue-eyed and fair and so are both of my\npaternal aunts. I didn\u2019t realize there were inherited metabolic factors as\nwell until my first complete blood workup as part of a health check before\ngoing off to do field work in the jungles of Central America. The printout\nshowed all the values of the components of my blood to be in the normal range,\nexcept for an asterisk next to cholesterol number. Well, with all the bad news\nabout the effects of too much cholesterol, that was a shocker. (This was back\nin the day \u2014 the printout only showed the numbers without including the normal\nrange for each value.) I rushed back to the university health center to ask\nthe doctor how bad I had it and what should I do. However, he told me that\nyes, the asterisk indicated that my cholesterol was outside the normal range,\nbut that it was almost vanishingly low \u2014 which is why the computer had flagged\nit with an asterisk. And this was at a time when I ate eggs daily, drank whole\nmilk with every meal, and had some form of meat (even if it was only ground\nbeef in a spaghetti sauce or chili) for lunch and dinner. And so it has been\nmy whole life. When a different doctor reviewed a later blood workup while I\nwas serving in the Foreign Service (and our family had a much better budget\nfor food than when I was a graduate student), he looked at my somewhat pudgy\nform and asked in a somewhat disbelieving tone, \u201cAre you a vegetarian?\u201d Once\nagain, the point being that until we can account for all of the test subjects\u2019\ngenetic inheritances with regard to all nutrients, let alone lifestyle and\nenvironmental factors, drawing broad generalizations of what\u2019s good or bad\nfrom almost any nutritional study is going to be suspect, if not highly\nsuspect.\n\n    1. Sue Kalt\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 8:50 pm\n\nVery thought provoking response. You raised some really good points to chew\non. (pun intended)\n\nNutrition is more complex as it has to take into account the individual. You\nbrought up very good points \u2014 our metabolism differs from person to person and\nhow our bodies react to certain combinations of nutrients, body chemistry and\nactivity. The generalities of diets \u2014 be a vegan, be a vegetarian, be on Keto,\nbe on Atkins, be on this or that, should not be taken lightly. I fully\nunderstand people\u2019s aversion to food produced from animals \u2014 just like I fully\nunderstand people who like food produced from animals. I prefer a balance \u2014\nthe body wants a balance.\n\nWhen we become fat, or have high levels of \u201cbad\u201d substances in our system,\nbased on blood work and current measuring techniques, or have a bad reaction\nto certain foods and chemicals/substances, it is one way our body is reacting\nto an imbalance. I love veggies \u2014 certain veggies \u2014 but if I eat too much, I\ndon\u2019t feel good. During different times in our lives we have certain needs or\ncravings. When I was a kid, I did not like cheese. Drinking milk for a few\ndays resulted getting sick to my stomach or ending up in the bathroom. Now I\nlike cheese and I can tolerate half-and-half (not regular milk). Even a few\nyears ago I could not stand cilantro \u2014 it tasted like soap \u2014 but now I find it\nquite tasty. As a kid I liked raw peas but could not stand it in my soup. Now\nI can\u2019t get enough of the peas in the soup. All this just shows how are bodies\nand nutrient-needs change over time.\n\nI know saying, \u201ceat in moderation,\u201d is like using a match to light a fire, but\nthe fact remains, our bodies are complex systems striving for homeostasis \u2014\nthat necessary equilibrium to maintain health. Upset that cart, and upset that\nfine balance. That is why it is hard to only look at one element and say your\nbody needs this or that without knowing with what other elements it will\nreact. Even within the same family one has variations in body chemistry,\nactivity, and external substance exposure. Knowing what works for us,\nindividually, is the better way to approach nutrition. If I develop a rash\nafter eating strawberries, should I keep eating them or take an allergy pill\nso I can eat it? Going down that rabbit hole, medications can also start to\ntilt that fine balance.\n\nWe cannot account for everything in our bodies and how it all reacts together.\nHowever, we need to know the underlying cause of symptoms rather than throwing\nmedication at it or finding that one super food to end all super foods.\nMarketing material should never serve as a guide to nutrition. Common sense,\nbalanced meals, and paying attention to what your body is telling you is the\nbetter approach to nutrition. My dad lived to be 97 not by eating junk food or\nbeing a vegetarian, or being vegan, or being gluten free, or being egg free.\nHe liked balanced meals \u2014 meat, potatoes, vegetables, fruit. Meat could be\nanything \u2014 pork, chicken, beef, fish, etc. In his late eighties he would\ncomplain about the quality of the meat found in grocery stores \u2014 they were\ntasteless so those times when I bought expensive organic meats, he noticed\ndifference in taste. He was mentally sharp to the day he died.\n\nWe will all die, so stress less over extreme positions \u2014 eat what you like in\na balanced way. Your body needs all types of nutrients \u2014 but what works for\nyou may not necessarily work for me so look at your own plate, not mine.\n\n    2. CVG\n\nJuly 21, 2019 at 1:03 am\n\n@Kim Hargan \u2013 I read your reply to IMissLiberty and thought, \u201cWow! Yes. Why\ndon\u2019t more people understand these things like this Kim person does.

Rik\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 7:27 pm\n\nActually Robo that is incorrect. No cholesterol = no bile production in your\nbody. No bile = poor digestion. Poor digestion = malnutrition.

Robo\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 11:53 pm\n\nSorry Rik, Bile helps to emulsify fats. Bile contains cholesterol that is made\nin the liver.

I remember\nwhen scientists said sugary cereals were actually good for you, and then it\nturned out General Mills had funded the study. Likewise, the person who\nmentioned that eggs contain lecithin which helps to process cholesterol.\nNutrients work together, and if you just get some but not others, the\ndeficiencies produced can inhibit the absorption of the ones you took in. You\ncan\u2019t just say, take this or eat this or don\u2019t eat that one thing and you\u2019ll\nbe fine, especially in cases of already established ill health. Not to mention\nthat these studies don\u2019t take into account food allergies, genetic factors,\nand the consumption of commercially grown foods with pesticide and herbicide\ntoxin residues and/or missing critical nutrients grown in soil worn out from\nplanting the same crops over and over and using chemical fertilizers that trap\nminerals in the soil. There are sound nutrition principles, but you have to\napply them as an art as well as a science.\n\n  33. Barbara Scott\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 4:20 pm\n\nInteresting information Dr. Fleming.

Steve Koelzer\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 10:36 pm\n\nCholesterol is essential but not needed. Why? Its natural function is to\nmodulate the dynamic viscosity of membranes. Cell membranes are lipid bilayers\nconsisting of lipid bilayers of fatty acids arranged with hydrocarbon tails\nend to end comprising the membrane center and the fatty acid heads forming the\noutsides. Soap bubbles follow the same physical arrangement. The hydrocarbon\ntail of cholesterol dissolves into this area because in chemistry \u201clike\ndissolves like\u201d. Cholesterol modulates the dynamic viscosity of the membrane\nlike an anchor wherein it moves in and out according to the principles of\nsolvency. Many other natural products conform to membrane properties. Books\nare written on the subject. Of interest are the essential (polyunsaturaated)\nfatty acids, omega three (\u03a9-3, linolenic acid) and omega six (\u03a9-6, linoleic\nacid) and their metabolites. Many disease-like conditions result from their\nlack. For example, brain functioning, scaly skin, migraine and vascular\nfunctioning... Books have also been written on all of these, too. I chug flax\noil (mixing with saliva, to liberate the free fatty acids) before swallowing.\nThis is how I get my Essential Fatty Acids. I highly recommend it (organically\ngrown Flax oil from Saskatchewan, CAN.)

James\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 3:11 pm\n\nAfter my Doctor told me a year ago that I needed to loose weight, and be on\nmedicine for my high bad cholesterol and blood pressure I tried various diets\nwhich did not work. My son was having problems and to support him I went on a\nKeto diet with him. (That would mean Eggs and Bacon almost every day.) I over\ndid it at first and lost 40 lbs in about 40 days after realizing it was a\nlittle much I stopped counting carbs on vegetables and added nuts when I\nneeded a boost (maintaining weight). Still eat eggs and bacon almost ever day\nand 2 months ago when I saw my doctor he said: \u201cWow! What did you do? You bad\ncholesterol is low, the good is really high and your blood pressure is on the\nlow side of normal.\u201d I do not know about other people but apparently for now,\nthis life stile diet works well for my particular physiology.

Ben Sbeg\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 3:02 pm\n\nWell, if you eat two eggs a day and splurge on sweet things like sweet coffee,\njam, and other fast carbs, of course you\u2019ll get heart disease ! The reason is\nthat fast carbs spike insulin levels which shuts down lipid metabolism, which\nin turn become stored dead weight in all places such as arteries and liver.\nThe minimum will be a cardiovascular disease. Elementary Mr. Watson ! And I\nbet that those smart college persons did not take that into account. I find it\nvery instructive that people go to such expense to ge a higher education and\nbecome so dumb. May be they\u2019re agents of the vegetalian lobby, uuh ?\n\n    1.

Andy W\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 6:19 pm\n\ninsulin indeed ,is the problem. And eating meat (or protein) also raises\ninsulin. It may not raise glucose (although in some ketogenic people) it does.\nBut as your rightfully point out the culprit is insulin. The problem with\ninsulin is you can\u2019t live without it and you can\u2019t live with it. Its the high\nlevel of insulin. The only answer is a diet that results in low levels of\ninsulin. This will happen with a high fat diet. So go 1/3 protein, 1/3\nveggies, and 1/3 fat from nuts not grains or animals.\n\n  39. Ziggy\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 2:34 pm\n\nPeople need to stop looking at trends and fads and start understanding their\nown bodies. Just turned 45. I\u2019m 5\u20199, 200 pound female but nobody has ever\nguess that I weigh more than 160 because of my build, body fat, stature and\nathletic physique.\n\nSince around 1994 when I was 20, I have been an intermittent faster. I didn\u2019t\neven know that was a \u201cthing\u201d and it certainly wasn\u2019t a popular term at the\ntime. My reasoning for doing it back then was simply that I got full really\nquickly and hated going to bed on a full stomach. So I generally stopped\neating after 6pm-ish. At the time, and even as recently as 5 years ago,\nfriends would look at me like I was crazy? They couldn\u2019t believe I could go\nthat long without eating and not get hungry. What they didn\u2019t understand as I\ntried to explain to them, is that this worked for MY BODY because that was how\nmy body responded to food.\n\nI\u2019m still intermittent fasting today and I\u2019m not a small girl but I never\ngained a lot of weight (average + or \u2013 5 pounds during my cycle; max 10 pounds\ngenerally.). In my 20s and 30s I ate pretty much anything I wanted (in\nmoderation) and although not a junk food junkie, I definitely ate my fair\nshare of pizza and burgers. I worked out moderately over the years but never a\ngym rat. I\u2019ve always had high cholesterol but my good cholesterol (HDL?) is\nalways perfect. How does that even make sense, I thought? Well, it\u2019s possible,\nI learned. But docs were concerned so I cut eggs from my diet per their\nadvice. They also wanted to put me on meds but I declined because I wanted to\nsee if eggs were the culprit. Come to learn, cutting eggs alone did not lower\nmy numbers. In fact, nothing did.\n\nAround 2000 I was diagnosed as Hyperthyroid. Removed it and now I\u2019m\nhypothyroid. My bad cholesterol is still bad and good cholesterol still good.\nDoctors have now told me my metabolism and cholesterol levels will always be\naffected by this condition. So I\u2019m also back to eating eggs. Why? Because it\nalso turns out that high cholesterol is hereditary and no matter what I do,\nand unless I\u2019m on meds, I can\u2019t avoid it. So it turns out that for me, eggs\nisn\u2019t necessarily the bad guy here. And the idea that it\u2019s touted as a\nterrible food is unfortunate.\n\nToday I still fast intermittently, although I\u2019m more prone to snacking at 8pm.\nMy metabolism is definitely affected by my thyroid condition as I now find I\ncan\u2019t lose weight even when I work out 5 times a week. But the bottom line is\nthat I have never felt overweight even though probably 50 \u2013 60% of my family\nmembers would be considered obese. So it\u2019s all relative. People have to stop\nblindly relying on studies. If you can, find and stick with a doctor who\nunderstands your medical history and story. Also, Live Your Life Your Way and\nnot by the way of others. Studies aren\u2019t 100% applicable to everyone so use\ndiscernment when absorbing the info.\n\n    1.

Escondido\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 2:23 pm\n\nIf someone claiming to be a doctor talks about calories and losing weight, run\nto the nearest exit, and lock it behind you as you leave. Calories are\nmeasured by burning the food items. Your body does not burn food. It digests\nit. You need not learn from clowns with an axe to grind. Go to Amazon, and buy\na used Guyton and Hall physiology text book. You can get an older edition for\nless than $10 including shipping. It is not easy reading, but most literate\nfolks with patience and access to Internet dictionaries can handle it.\n\nG & H describes the different digestion processes for carbs; fats (called\nlipids in G & H); and protein. And, it specifically says if you increase fats\n(lipids) and decrease carbs, the body starts burning its own fat. (i.e. \u2013\nAtkins.)\n\nThe cells of the body can get their energy from glucose OR fat. There is no\nMDR for carbs. Once your body adjusts to no carbs the liver converts enough\nfat to glucose for the brain and other critical organs. MDR for carbs is\n0.000g/day. Yet, all of medicine, including diet research, is based on a\n\u2018glucose diet\u2019. Both the Canadian government and the Atkins Institute have\nfound that Diabetes Type II can be CURED with low-carb diets.\n\nI certainly agree with the person who said most doctors are technicians, not\nscientists. My best friend in Mexico is a doctor who says the same thing. So\nis he. I saved his life when he developed Intermittent Claudication and he\nadmits it; he has yet to save my life.\n\n    1. Robo\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 5:42 pm\n\nYou do realize that Dr. Aktins did of a stroke, which subsequently is one form\nof cardiovascular disease \u2013 go figure! Also, you are correct we do not \u201cburn\u201d\ncalories in the sense that the word burn is usually associated with. We do\nbreak down ingested particles at a molecular level that helps provide us with\nenergy.\n\n      1.

Tired of psuedoscientists\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 1:57 pm\n\nUnless this study made sure these 30k people ONLY ate eggs with their\nbreakfast, it\u2019s ridiculous to assume eggs are the main contributor of the\nincrease in cholesterol. Most people who eat eggs tend to eat them with things\nlike bacon or sausages, etc... I\u2019m tired of these statistic based studies.\nstatistics are a fallacy that the new generations are latching onto like a\ndrowning man in an ocean. All studies are biased in some way, and in most\ncases they are morosely biased towards an intended result. Usually the study\nis only created for the purpose of selling some product, or influencing an\nindustry/market. In most other cases it\u2019s about some individual trying to get\nnoticed for a paper he/she wrote, so the more controversial they can \u201carrange\u201d\nthe results to become the more notoriety they get. It\u2019s disgusting really how\nmany youtubers, pseudo-scientists, and just basic wack jobs, can get so many\npeople to listen to them when common sense and logic are completely thrown out\nthe window these days. If ten sites on the internet say something is the \u201cnew\nanswer to everything\u201d everyone jumps on the proverbial \u201ctruth wagon\u201d and acts\nlike it must be true, when in fact in most scenarios, the \u201cfact\u201d was based on\nan opinion that was re-posted/rehashed and then \u201cconfirmed\u201d through a biased\nstudy so many times that it becomes a fake fact. This is similar to how \u201cza\u201d\ncame to be allowed in the American dictionary as an actual word for \u201cpizza\u201d\nWhat a joke when laziness of basic reasoning becomes the standard for\nestablishing the facts of tomorrow or today. It\u2019s so sad that the words fact\nand truth have utterly lost their defining meaning in the last twenty years.\nWhen you throw out logic/common sense/reason, and everything becomes\nsubjective, we are left with a tenuous world built on lies and self deception.\nNo wonder the new generations are lacking in confidence when the world around\nthem keeps redefining reality on a daily and sometimes hourly basis of\npopularity votes.\n\n  44.

An old army joke says, \u201cIn a war\nzone, anything you do can get you killed including doing nothing at all\u201d. I\ncan tell you from personal experience that sleeping meets the definition of\none of those \u201cdoing nothing at all\u201d situations. My cousin was killed one night\ndue to in-coming enemy rocket or mortar fire while sleeping next to his\nArmored Personnel Carrier with the Amercal Division in Vietnam.\n\nIn the same war, 2 years earlier, I survived a friendly fire incident in the\ncentral highlands of South Vietnam while sleeping when a U.S. Army, 105\nhowitzer artillery shell landed close by. After the explosion,I thought it was\nsomeone setting off a Claymore mine on our defense perimeter. Next it sounded\nlike rain started landing on our olive drab in color, general purpose, medium\ntent, then the rain got chunckier. Do you know about the Eureka effect? That\u2019s\nrefers to the common human experience of SUDDENLY understanding a previously\nincomprehensible problem. \u201cThat\u2019s not rain landing on our tent, that\u2019s dirt!!\nI thought. Eureka! Translated into military speak, O, Sh*t!! Kicked up from an\nincoming artillery strike!! No one was killed or injured. The reason that\nstrike happened, Guerrilla Tactics. The enemy was able to simulate a call for\n\u201cfire support\u201d using our LOCATION on our OWN military, voice, radio defense\nnetwork!! Gotta hate that when it happens.

Of\ncourse, people say one thing and do other things. That\u2019s why systematic\nobservation is so important and why survey data are often so hard to learn\nfrom. But well-done, long term field studies are expensive, so that kind of\nwork is rare. It is not true that the bigger the sample the more robust the\nresult. The opposite may be said to be true the bigger the sample, the greater\nthe potential for errors. That\u2019s why people use statistical sampling. That,\ntoo, has limitations, if you are stuck with means-based statistical measures.\nLife does not revolve around the mean (see, for example, Maltz, M.D., 1994.\nDeviating from the mean: The declining significance of significance. Journal\nof research in crime and delinquency, 31(4), pp.434-463). Seems quite correct\nthat a single-food study is misleading and unhelpful. Quite right that surveys\nare very much limited and over-used in much of public health research. Solid\nethnographic work combines systematic observational, survey, and text and\ndiscourse analysis to understand a fuller range of the contexts, in and\nthrough which food choices are made, when, and why. Once you identify well-\nunderstood clusters of variables, there is great benefit in experimental\ntechniques, but choosing a method depends on the context of the\nstudy\u2013experimental work is not automatically better. Are folks in public\nhealth or nutrition studies trained for multi-method work? That would be a\ngreat question for a science writer, IMHO.\n\n  49.

Eggs, Meat, Butter, etc... are\ngenerally not good for you, and the only reason we ate them for hundreds and\nthousands of years, it is simply because we didn\u2019t have food sources during\nseasons when plant based foods were unavailable. We never needed to. NEVER...!\nAnd we still don\u2019t; in fact, it hurts us, slowly but surely.\n\n  50. Zapp Kerblapp\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 1:08 pm\n\nThe egg is both good and bad for cardiovascular health. This most recent\nstudy, noted in this article, actually clarifies the situation immensely.\nUnfortunately, the researchers and publishers of this most recent research\ndidn\u2019t discuss their findings with cellular biologists or gastroenterologists.\n\nThe egg is good because it contains a suite of healthy amino proteins and two\nof these contain substantial amount of sulfur: methionine and cysteine. Sulfur\nin small yet daily amounts is crucial for mitochondria to efficiently\nfunction. The result is that when they\u2019re busy converting ADP to ATP, they\ngive off fewer free radicals that can result in cellular disruption and\ninflammation. The studies showing that egg consumption, up to two a day, was\nstrongly correlated with lower cardiovascular risk was done in a population\nthat rarely gets these amino acids in sufficient quantity from other sources\nas they don\u2019t eat much meat. So if you\u2019re mostly a vegetarian or on a diet\nthat doesn\u2019t include beef and pork, eating an egg or two a day is very\nhealthy. The egg is also good because the cholesterol that it contains, also\nknown as dietary cholesterol, has been found in many studies to not make it\u2019s\nway from digestion into the blood stream in detectable quantities. The rise in\ncholesterol that was seen in this most recent study, noted in this article,\nwas produced within the body. It didn\u2019t come from the eggs. In this case,\ncorrelation doesn\u2019t equal causation. The egg was falsely blamed at the scene\nof the crime for circumstantial evidence. Eggs also contain creatine that\u2019s\nused by the body to produce phosphocreatine, an element highly vital to\nmitochondria in the production of ATP, the preferred energy supply for the\ncell.\n\nThe egg is bad because it contains contains a substantial amount of the highly\nreactive form of iron called heme, 1 mg/two eggs and lecithin. Heme is the\nsame type of iron that\u2019s contained in beef and pork, both linked with\nincreasing cardiovascular risk. Two eggs contain approximately the same amount\nof iron as 2 ounces of beef.\n\nSecondly, a gut bacteria is preferentially fed and thrives on a diet of\nlecithin and carnitine (along with more common choline and other nutrients),\nproducing TMAO that leads to a dramatic increase in inflammatory factors in\nthe blood stream just 10 minutes after consuming them, assuming that you eat\nthis diet at least weekly (Vegetarians didn\u2019t harbor this particular variety\nof bacteria in sufficient numbers, so they were able to eat bacon, eggs, and\nbeef with impunity, but just once a month... of course if they ate meat more\noften they certainly wouldn\u2019t be Vegetarians.). A serving of 4 ounce steak\ncontains 100 milligrams of carnitine. (reference: Research, led by Stanley\nHazen, M.D., Ph.D.Cleveland Clinic: \u201cCleveland Clinic Studies Reveal Role of\nRed Meat in Gut Bacteria, Heart Disease Development\u201d). A single egg contains\nup to 1.3 grams of lecithin. If you\u2019re eating meat and eggs in your weekly\ndiet, the lecithin from the eggs will increase the production of TMAO and\nresult in higher cardiovascular risk.\n\nI\u2019d like to note that the book Forks over Knives featured a study where they\nremoved both meat and eggs from the diet of fire fighters, resulting in a\nsubstantial improvement in cardiac health. If the study was repeated, where\nthey just removed the beef and pork while keeping 1-2 eggs per day in the diet\nand then compared it to a diet that lacked both meat and eggs, the group\neating only eggs along with the primarily vegetarian diet would\u2019ve had the\nlowest cardiac risk. Perhaps this will be sensationally published in a study\nin the next decade.\n\n  51. Anthony R\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 1:07 pm\n\nThere is only one diet that has gotten people off diabetes medication,\nreversed heart disease, or stopped the progress of cancer. Starch based diets\nthat reduce or eliminated the use of processed oils, sugar and salt. The\nproteins in meat,milk and eggs are not even of any particular quality. The\nAmino acids in meat and dairy products that we cant use have to be eliminated\nand during that process produce an acid byproduct that slowly weaken bones and\ncause osteoporosis.

The following is how an average Joe\nprocessed the article and the proceeding comments.\n\nThanks for all the input everyone. From the comments above, it seems, life\nstyle is worth considering first. If you enjoy a sedentary approach to life\nyour dietary needs would be of foods that are slow to digest and offer up slow\ninsulin increase. If you are highly active or hard charging, foods that\nsupport higher energy release and recovery requirements are needed. I have no\nformal training nor education in medical / nutritional science. Reading up on\nfood studies is my way of maximizing my dietary needs to budgetary reality.\n\nI use to be really active because my body allowed me to be. Now that I\u2019m\ngetting on in years my body just doesn\u2019t recover as fast as it use to. So less\nactivity leading to less expensive injury (monetary and quality of life cost)\nseems to be the road to more enjoyable miles on life\u2019s odometer. So, for me,\nlots less concentrated sugar and less process foods (foods that spike insulin\n?) allow for more whole fruits and vegetables with more lean higher quality\nproteins with fats that promote good cardiovascular and mental function and\ninclude foods that increase my metabolic rate (intensify caloric burn\nrate(s)(?)).\n\nThat said, how do eggs fit into my life style, dietary and monetary\nrestrictions? 1. Readily available, sustainable and affordable source of\ndietary protein? Seems so. 2. Do eggs support the dietary requirements of a\nmoderately active middle aged person? Seems so 3. I\u2019m I grazer or hunter? This\nanimal eats animals, fruits, nuts and vegetables. ;-). Opportunistic because\nmy job, wallet and local market said so.\n\nWell to close its seems consulting with a nutritional expert is the only means\nof getting closer to the truth about eggs. Be well and eat well my fellow\nanimal friends. That is, if you can afford it.;-)\n\nGod Bless\n\nP.S. \u2013 What eggactly is bulletproof coffee?

BUT \u2013 also full of lecithin, the substance that cuts the sticky\nclumps cholesterol into tiny pieces so they can enter the cells and not get\nstuck to the walls of your arteries.\n\nThis information has been known for over 50 years.\n\n    1. Fadi\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 1:22 pm\n\nThere is nothing more frightful than ignorance in action.\n\nHumans DO NOT need to ingest cholesterol; yet another myth. The body makes its\nown. The body can make 100% of all cholesterol you eat. You just have to\nunderstand what cholesterol is. To understand this, you need to go to the raw\nscience. For example, the NCBI NIH\u2019s database of hundreds of real medical\narticles. Reading \u201cBRO Science\u201d articles, including the one above, and other\nweb based articles, is just another reason people just spew out garbage,\nwhether in support or against, a particular topic.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470561/\n\nCHOLESTEROL can be introduced into the blood through the digestion of dietary\nfat via chylomicrons. However, since cholesterol has an important role in\ncellular function, it can also be directly synthesized by each cell in the\nbody. The synthesis of cholesterol begins from Acetyl-CoA and follows a series\nof complex reactions that will not be covered in this article. A primary\nlocation for this process is the liver, which accounts for most de-novo\ncholesterol synthesis. Since cholesterol is mostly a lipophilic molecule, it\ndoes not dissolve well in blood. For this reason, it is packaged in\nlipoproteins which have phospholipid, and apolipoprotein [3]. Lipoproteins are\nmade up of a lipid core (which can contain cholesterol esters and\ntriglycerides) and a hydrophilic outer membrane comprising phospholipid,\napolipoprotein, and free cholesterol.\n\n+++++\n\nSimply put, we DO NOT NEED need to ingest ANY Cholesterol at all. And HDL and\nLDL is NOT cholesterol; it is the lipoprotein that carries the cholesterol\naround. Don\u2019t confuse a bus of children for the children themselves.\n\n+++\n\nThere is nothing more frightful than ignorance in action. Ignorance more\nfrequently begets confidence than it does knowledge.\n\n    2. M Lee fan\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 2:09 pm\n\nYou roasted them M. Lee, let them have it\n\n    3.

Lee, our bodies make all of the cholesterol we need, There is no need\nto ingest it what so ever. The terms you mentioned have very little if any\nreal meaning in this context. If you can get eggs from a guy down the road,\nwell then you are in the one half of one percent of those who can. The rest of\nthe eggs are from birds living in their own excrement. They are not healthy\nnor nutritious. If they were, that information would be right under their\ntagline \u201cthe incredible, edible egg\u201d.

Rachelle\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 11:36 am\n\nAlso, most food studies are on factory raised food: which is raised on\nextremely substandard and unnatural nutrition and conditions...and then it\ngets applied to all of that type of food i.e. eggs, milk, meat and various\nplants, even those naturally raised. I say eat God\u2019s food (especially what\ngrows naturally in your climate) grown in health promoting conditions, and\neaten when that type of food is abundant (intensive on milk, eggs,\ngreens/plants etc in the spring/summer/fall and foods that naturally store\nwell in a root cellar or without refrigeration for winter (meat, real\nfermented food, root vegetables, apples etc).

With that change, wine, with its alcohol, was dropped\nfrom my O.K. to have list. Eggs are the same. A lot depends on how one\u2019s body\nis handling cholesterol. When I was healthy both eggs and wine were fine. Now,\nboth are verboten. That said, I may not be healthy but I am leading a\nsuccessful life with my modified diet. I am now on my second pacemaker/ICD and\nhope to live long enough to have a third. Cheers!\n\n    2. Rexford O Ames\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 3:31 pm\n\nPoint well made. In my world.

It\u2019s another ploy to promote the use of statin drugs\nwhich have so many harmful side effects. Eggs are one of most nutritional\nfoods we can eat, and if cage-free, pasture-raised the better.\n\n    1. Anthony R\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 1:22 pm\n\nYour comment that eggs are one of the most nutritious foods cant be backed by\nany scientific study. All studies with exception of those by the meat and\ndairy industry have shown what cholesterol does and how it promotes heart\nAttacks and stroke. Cholesterol is merely a marker which shows how much animal\nproteins a person is consuming. Eggs being highly concentrated with\ncholesterol. The consumption of eggs creates choline in the gut which is\nanother indicator like cholesterol. Almost all cancer patients have Colline in\nthere system. so much so it is used to screen for cancer. No study has ever\nfound that adding more protein to anyone\u2019s diet has had positive effects on\ndisease or life span. In fact they all show reduced life span and more\ndisease.\n\n  66.

I used to be on one and that is when I felt the\nmost horrible with barely no energy, I had also had hard time staying awake\nand my weight kept going up. When I had switched form eating meat to a more\nwhole plant food diet my weight went down and I am not as tired a used be and\nhave more energy and have no problem staying awake. I do not eat meat anymore,\ni do not drink milk anymore. On occasion I will eat cheese. Granted anecdotal\nstories is not scientific studies. Every person handle food differently and\nreact differently. Some people can do well on an all beef diet and some can\nnot. I do agree crops can most destructive to ecosystem. But majority of the\ncrops that are grown are not for human consumption. They are for animal\nconsumption such cows being fed grain which is not the natural diet. The main\nreason I believe the people have the many health issues that they do is the\neating of ultra process garbage from food manufactures instead making real\nfood from scratch. Please research the Dr.Kempner diet and Dr. John McDougal\ndiet. Also look at Dr. Campbell of the China Study and Dr. Esselystien. Now\nthe food stated that are plant-based are also process food and are not health\nfood since they devoid of most nutrition from the whole food counterparts. The\nplant base foods such as the impossible burger is give choice. Either eat a\nbeef burger knowing that is promoting murder of an sentient being or eat the\nplant base alternative knowing that money spent was not spent on killing an\nanimal.\n\n    6.

Memo\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 10:55 am\n\nFollow the $$$$\n\nThe strange idea that cholesterol causes atherosclerosis was revived in the\n1950s when the vegetable oil industry learned that their polyunsaturated oils\nlowered serum cholesterol. (Many other toxins lower cholesterol, but that is\nnever mentioned.) The industry began advertising their oils as \u201cheart\nprotective,\u201d and they enlisted some influential organizations to help in their\nadvertising: The American Dietetic Association, the American Heart\nAssociation, the US Dept. of Agriculture and FDA, and the AMA. Besides the\nearly rabbit research, which didn\u2019t make their case against cholesterol and\nmight actually have had implications harmful to their argument (since\nAnitschkow had used vegetable oil as solvent for his cholesterol feedings),\nthe oil industry helped to create and promote a large amount of fraudulent and\nunscientific work.\n\n  70. Dr, J\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 10:42 am\n\nLet me start by situating my source of knowledge on this topic\u2013I have been a\nscientist for over 25 years and have had to deal with the problems commonly\nassociated with research methodology during all that time. This article\nfundamentally misunderstands the manner in which the process of scientific\nresearch builds knowledge. First of all one instance of research is\ninsufficient to produce unquestionable knowledge\u2013on any topic, not just\nnutrition. In order to scientifically produce knowledge there must be a large\nbody of research, meaning extensive numbers of individual research efforts in\nwhich, essentially, scientists efforts are all in competition with one another\nin order to help researchers refine ensuing efforts. Every scientist knows and\nsees the mistakes (methedological and otherwise) other scientists are making\n(as long as it is ethically reported in research report articles) and their\nown research, typically in the review of the literature portion of every\nscientific article, must address what others did wrong/right and how this\ninfluenced how and why they preformed research as they did. What I\u2019m saying is\nthat picking out a few specific articles will not adequately support the\nauthor\u2019s contentions, and this means this article is highly flawed.\n\nThe present article also ignores the fact that all science is flawed. There is\nno perfect way, even with the use of experimental research design, to filter\nout all possible errors. This is why the scientific process requires a large\nbody of work addressing each topic, as well as replication research in order\nto examine and test previous research. Also, because of how science produces\nknowledge (using many varieties of research methods) there is most certainly\nroom for research based on survey methods in nutrition research. With a great\ndeal of replication research, over time survey research can and does most\ncertainly contribute to our knowledge of nutrition. The real problems with all\nscientific research today is the way in which research gets funded and the\nmanner in which scientists are pushed to produce \u201coriginal\u201d research.\u201d\nUnfortunately too many scientists erroneously believe that \u201coriginal research\u201d\nrefers to research on a topic that has never been done before, when all it\nreally means is that they must do research in which they design it and collect\nthe data. This common misunderstanding results in far too few replication\nstudies which scientific knowledge relies on in order to test all previous\nresearch on a topic. Publication requirements also influence the types of\nresearch that gets done, and too often flawed publication efforts filter out\nreally good research which then may never get published. Research that is\nhighly technical or advanced also can get overlooked (not published) due to\npublication editors and reviewers who aren\u2019t knowledgeable enough on a topic\nor are simply intellectually unable to comprehend a topic. My point is that\nthe nature of the process of developing knowledge scientifically is filled\nwith many areas in which errors are commonly made, and the idea promoted by\nthis article, namely that using the experimental design would \u201cfix\u201d the flaws\nin nutrition research is quite preposterous.\n\n  71. alexa G\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 10:27 am\n\nTripe.

Dennis DeBasco\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 10:15 am\n\nNone of the nutritional studies, whatever their results, seems to care that\neveryone has a particular and unique system. No rule applies across the board\nto everyone. This is simple common sense which Chinese medicine understands\nperfectly but Western medicine refuses to address or acknowledge. Eggs are\nfine for some people, not for others.\n\n  76. Fred Y\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 9:59 am\n\nThere\u2019s ONE very important fact that every study I\u2019ve ever read about seems to\nmiss and that is the \u201corder\u201d in which you eat certain foods.\n\nLet me explain. As a two-time cancer patient, I had bladder cancer in 2007 and\ncolon cancer in 2017. I\u2019ve had a neo-bladder since 2007 which is that they\ntook a section of my small intestine ou and built a bladder that works as a\nsubstitute for the original. Also with the colon cancer, they removed some of\nmy large intestines.\n\nSo as you can imagine my entire digestive system is now shorter than what God\nintended and gove us. As a result, I need Vttiaman B12 injections every 28\ndays, because vitamin B12 is one of the hardest vitamins for our system to\nabsorb.\n\nOne of the worst side effects of having a shorter GI trace system is that I\u2019m\nsubject to diarrhea. This may sound like an advertisement but it isn\u2019t.\n\nThe simple solution that I found is taking 2 heaping teaspoons of ground chia\nseeds and 3 heaping tablespoons full of milled flax seed BEFORE eating\nanything EVERY day. The two tend to slow my GI trace down and thus I\u201dm able to\nregulate myself this way. The easiest and most nutritional way I\u2019ve found to\ndo this is to add the two ingredients to a large smoothie I drink every day\nbefore eating anything. The smoothies consist of pineapple, apple orange,\ngrapes, strawberries, blueberries, spinach or kale, or some other vegetables\nand fruits that are in season. I freeze the strawberries, blueberries, kale,\nand spinach as they perish quickly.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I\u2019d suggest that it\u2019s not only what you eat it\u2019s the order\nyou eat it. It\u2019s like eating a salad before a meal. So I\u2019d suggest that people\nwho are overweight tend to have slower digestive traces than people who remain\nthin no matter what they eat. For some reason, these facts never seem to be a\npart of these studies.\n\n  77.

Anna\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 9:43 am\n\nEggs contain everything necessary for to properly grow and sustain a living\nbeing. Of course eggs are healthy for us! If we don\u2019t overeat, eat a varied\ndiet of largely unprocessed foods with lots of fruits and veggies and stay\nactive at least a little bit, most of us will be healthy. For example, my\ndaily breakfast contains 1 egg, 1/2 of an avocado, and 1 slice of homemade\nwhole wheat toast, snack is a plain yogurt or a piece of fruit like a\ngrapefruit or banana. Lunch is leftovers from dinner the night before, and\ndinner might be something like chicken Marsala with a giant serving of green\nbeans from the garden and brown rice. I usually have 1-2 dinners a week that\nare vegetarian, like black bean and sweet potato soup, or lentil Shepard\u2019s\npie. I choose to push mow my lawn. I walk my dog at least a mile every day,\nand when I go to the restroom at work I usually do 10 squats before washing my\nhands to squeeze in a little activity. I do no other exercise and at 29 years\nold I\u2019m at an ideal body weight and all of my \u201cvitals\u201d are excellent with a\nresting heart rate of about 65-75 beats per minute and a blood pressure of\n115/75.

For reasons still not sure of but as a\nwhole, we were a healthy lot. Sure we were active as a general rule. Kids went\nto school, learned real world issues and systems that worked and what didn\u2019t.\nNever perfect and we talked and listened to each other.

Tashia Berman\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 8:58 am\n\nToday with all the food and nutrition tracking apps, I don\u2019t see why a large-\nscale cohort could not be created for nutritional and dietary studies that\nself-report using a tracking app. If they can be made to self-report even when\nthey \u201ccheat\u201d then those transgressions can be accounted for or excluded from\nthe study.\n\nAnecdotally, I belong to a support group who do avoid excess carbohydrates on\na low-carb, ketogenic diet. MANY report enormous health benefits in addition\nto weight loss and have found it to be sustainable in the long term. It\nhappens that I am also fighting metastatic breast cancer. When I was\ndiagnosed, I was halfheartedly doing the keto diet \u2014 frequently cheating, not\nreally tracking, etc. \u2014 but after diagnosis I cracked down hard on the diet.\n\nSome reading of the research I was able to find indicated that indeed cancer\ncells do uptake glucose on a massive scale and through a different metabolic\nchannel than do normal cells. What I had learned about a ketogenic diet \u2014\noriginally created to help people with intractable seizures \u2014 was that normal\ncells could live on ketones produced in the liver. I hypothesized that cancer\ncells probably could NOT, given their proclivity for massive amounts of\nglucose uptake and rapid reproduction.\n\nSince getting serious and strict with my ketogenic diet, my cancer has\nsubsided over 50% in just 9 months, over 3 separate CT scans. Full disclosure\n\u2014 I AM getting chemo treatment with carboplatin. However my cancer was triple\nnegative and I wasn\u2019t given a lot of hope for it responding to much of\nanything over the long term.\n\nUnfortunately, whenever I have told this to people who have exhausted their\ntreatment options and resigned themselves to die, I am as much as banned from\nthe discussion boards for daring to give anyone any hope. I would hope that\nsome scientist would undertake such a study and prove whether or not this has\nany merit. While I would not recommend anyone forego treatment with\nchemotherapy, this would be an excellent candidate for an adjunct treatment\nand might allow for less aggressive chemo with fewer side effects that would\nhave a better success rate over the long term when combined with the proper\ndietary intervention. Why not include a dietician in the treatment team and\ngive it a try?\n\n  86. Diane Warfield\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 8:45 am\n\nI had cancer and read everything I could about what contributes to it. One of\nthe factors is high levels of Omega-6 such in corn.\n\nI have been raising sheep for the last 5 years, mostly pasture, but also a\ntoken mixture of whole grains (oats, wheat, alfalfa pellets) so they\u2019ll come\nwhen I call them. I was amazed to find what a high level of corn all our\nanimals are fed which we then eat. So it is not just the chicken or the beef\nor the fish that is bad for us; if our food sources are fed large amounts of\ncorn (I am sure other feed too, but nothing is pushed like corn) as feed lot\nfed cattle, farm fed fish, confined chickens, and even wild herbivores such as\ndeer and pigs (hunters plant corn so the deer are fat and tasty), we then\nconsume the large amounts of Omega 6. When you combine that with the other\nthings we eat full high fructose corn syrup and corn starch, which are in just\nabout every processed food, I am not surprised that cancer rates are climbing.\n\n  87.

Eamon Nerbonne\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 5:54 am\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that it is very, very tricky to actually\naccount for hidden variables, to the point of often being numerically\nimpossible. So this quote:...\n\n\u201cAnd in fairness, the study\u2019s defenders say that it did a good job accounting\nfor factors that might have influenced the findings, such as overall fat\nconsumption, smoking, and lifestyle.\u201d\n\n...is almost certainly unreasonably optimistic. The issue is indirectly\npointed out in this article to, and that\u2019s that when we account for stuff like\n\u201cfat consumption\u201d and \u201clifestyle\u201d, we\u2019re not actually accounting for \u201cfat\nconsumption\u201d and \u201clifestyle\u201d, but for *our measurements* thereof. There\u2019s an\nerror, and if they had just one questionnaire decades ago \u2013 that error is\nlikely significant. And then there are certainly going to be non-linear\ninteractions between the factors you\u2019re correcting for \u2013 but you can only\naccount for factors with some known model, and often that\u2019s linear (but even\nif it\u2019s not \u2013 your model is almost certainly not precisely correct). What if\none of your corrected-for-factors interacts with a factor you didn\u2019t correct\nfor? I mention that because that\u2019s actually quite expected \u2013 they\u2019re trying to\naccount for \u201clifestyle\u201d, and even if they have some really specific definition\nof that, the fact remains that overal lifestyle patterns may well contain\nhidden risks and rewards, *and* that lifestyle, population wide, changes over\ndecades. Even a small generalization error caused by interpreting decades old\nlifestyles as todays might, after interacting with all the statistical\nmachinery needed to squeeze out significant but noisy effects from huge\nsamples, render the result moot today.\n\nThere\u2019s a much more interesting discussion here:\nhttps://www.talyarkoni.org/blog/2016/06/11/the-great-minds-journal-club-\ndiscusses-westfall-yarkoni-2016/ including links to academic papers that (try)\nto work through the statistics.\n\nBut I\u2019d like to think of this as a validation of KISS. If you need lots of\nstatistical machinery to find a significant result, there are lots of\nopportunities for mistakes. And even if somebody knew about all these\nmistakes, and were an expert on them... there\u2019s just so many chances for\ngotchas, and places were incorrect model assumptions can throw out your\ninterpretation... so even in the best of cases where unbiased experts honestly\ndo their best work \u2013 I think it\u2019s wise to retain a healthy dose of skepticism\nif they needed to correct for all kinds of factors to find a significant\nresult. (Not to mention that the choice of correcting or not needs to be\napriori, otherwise you\u2019re introducing a kind of publication bias!)\n\n    1.

I\u2019d go so far\nas to say, with very rare examples, any findings from the nutritional\n\u201cscientific\u201d community are not science at all. The humble egg is a rather easy\nexample to help people question how accurate the ever-changing views on\nnutrition are. Something far more controversial that will have people\nconvinced you are a lunatic for suggesting it, but equally as true, is to\npoint out that the well-organized, world-wide and frequently government-\nsponsored attack on sugar is every bit as much based on fallacies and bad\nscience.\n\nThe only thing we know with scientific certitude regarding nutrition is that\nthe body has energy requirements to function, that energy is provided by\nconsuming food, and that the measurement of that energy, calories, can\ndetermine whether one gains or loses weight in a rather simple formula: more\ncalories consumed than required leads to weight gain while fewer calories\nconsumed than required to maintain weight leads to weight loss. There are a\nvery few other nutritional scientific truths, but this is the one that should\nmatter to most people and is actionable for people willing to use the\ninformation.\n\n    1. Dr. Maya\n\nJuly 19, 2019 at 3:41 pm\n\nExcept you just missed one of the most important points, calories in must be <\ncalories out to lose weight is a fallacy that does not take into account a\nperson with a damaged (and therefore slowed) metabolism. That is one piece\nthat has been empirically and scientifically shown more than once, and yet\npeople who don't understand what that looks like continue to spout the same\nold calories in/calories out garbage.\n\n      1. Dr Troy Farringdon\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 4:06 am\n\nNo, calories in < calories out = weight loss is indeed all you need to know.\nIt takes into account metabolic rate: people with slower metabolisms have\nfewer calories out. That is what metabolism is \u2013 consumption of food calories\nto produce energy for cells. Indeed something like 80% of your food intake is\nspent entirely on metabolic processes \u2013 keeping you warm, breathing and alive.\nOnly a small proportion is used in moving (exercise). Of course, determining\nyour basal metabolic rate is not easy, so I think I see where you are coming\nfrom \u2013 if you have a \"damaged\" metabolism then you are liable to overestimate\nyour calorie expenditure.\n\n      2. James Corr\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 4:13 am\n\nWhy is the \u201ccalories in must be < calories out to lose weight\" a fallacy? Even\nwith a damaged metabolism I would think it would hold true. If your metabolism\nis slower doesn't that just mean you use less calories? So instead of needing\n2000 calories a day, you only need 1500 calories a day. If you were to consume\n1250 calories wouldn't you lose weight?\n\n        1. Cathy\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 10:03 am\n\nThat is theoretically correct except that, as stated in the article...once you\nstart dieting, the bodies metabolism slows down. For example, when eating a\n2000 calorie day, regular life and exercise will burn maybe 1800 calories.\nHowever, when on a restricted diet of 1250 calories \u2013 the very same regular\nlife and exercise that should be burning 1800 calories is now only burning\naround 1500 calories. It is how the body conserves the energy, unsure of when\nthe next influx of energy will come from. Even worse off is the chronic\ndieters metabolism! It is very hard to increase the rate of metabolism for\nthose people that diet on a regular basis. Pretty soon it becomes that you are\non a 1200 calorie diet and still gaining weight. I am in this boat myself. Add\nto the effect that our metabolism naturally slows down as we age and all the\nprocessed food that we consume. As well as our addiction to sugar and\neverything white (white flour, white rice, white sugar etc) everything\nstripped of nutritional content. It is not hard to see how the population is\nbecoming more and more obese.\n\n      3. Mark\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 4:21 am\n\nYep. If your weight is healthy, you\u2019re probably eating right. If not, you\u2019re\nprobably not. Medical conditions that cause people to be obese or too skinny\neven with healthy diets excepted of course.\n\n      4. Barnaby Clamp\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 4:40 am\n\nIt\u2019s been empirically and scientifically proven that you can consistently\nproduce an energy surplus over time in a closed system while using more joules\nthan are provided?

Bud Mor\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 5:23 am\n\nI\u2019m unaware of any evidence that disproves the idea that using more calories\nthan one consumes will result in weight loss; especially for the vast majority\nof people.\n\n        1.

It really is as\nsimple as calories in<calories out. This does NOT mean that there are not\nreactions by the body to input differences, and that it is not a complicated\nsystem. But until/unless it is proven otherwise, laws of conservation of\nmatter/energy and equal and opposite reactions holds true.\n\n      7.

James King\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 6:57 am\n\nI\u2019m confused. Are you saying that those with damaged, slow metabolisms should\nconsume MORE calories than they burn?\n\n        1.

The Food Lawyer\n\nJuly 19, 2019 at 12:19 pm\n\nExperts don\u2019t agree about avoiding processed foods, as \u201cprocessed\u201d is way too\nvague of a term. Cooking something is a process, mixing a salad is a process,\netc. Even \u201coverly processed\u201d is problematic, as most aren\u2019t really concerned\nabout the number of ingredients, but what the ingredients actually are.\n\n    1.

Brad Hansen\n\nJuly 19, 2019 at 12:05 pm\n\nThe key to evaluating nutrition studies is to examine three things: where did\nthe funding come from, what was the experimental design, and how were the\nresults analyzed?\n\nAll the positive findings on egg consumption turn out to be funded by various\nEgg Boards. He who pays the piper calls the tune. Those studies also usually\nhave small sample sizes and highly questionable designs.\n\nE.g. the egg study that resulted in the Time Magazine cover story \u201cEggs are\nBack\u201d had only 60 participants. And they were all white men who had unhealthy\ncholesterol levels at the START of the study. And all were on cholesterol\nlowering medication before and during the study.\n\nSo the actual result of that study is that if you\u2019re a white man who has an\nunhealthy cholesterol level, even while on medication, eating an egg a day\nwill not make you any more unhealthy. Hardly the recommendation that the mass\nmedia took from the study\u2019s summary. Read past the summary!\n\n    1. Not Brad\n\nJuly 19, 2019 at 11:54 pm\n\nBrad,\n\nIt\u2019s not really appropriate to convey your point with broad and false\ngeneralizations.

Hominid\n\nJuly 19, 2019 at 12:02 pm\n\n(1) Nutrition is a hypercomplex phenomenon encompassing many relevant,\ninteractive variables \u2013 scientific methodology fairs poorly with hypercomplex\nphenomena like much of human physiology, psychology, climate, nutrition,\neconomics, society. (2) Epidemiological studies do not address consideration\nof individual susceptibilities. One never knows where he lies in the\ndistribution or what factors are responsible for his position in the\ndistribution. (3) Studies based on human reporting are highly unreliable.\nPeople lie, spin, and don\u2019t realize what they are saying much of the time. (4)\nPhysicians are NOT scientists \u2013 they are technicians \u2013 and most have a poor\ngrasp of the requirements of rigorous science. They also have a GOAL in mind\nof finding beneficial conclusions \u2013 something a rigorous scientist would never\ndo.\n\n    1. Dr. Maya\n\nJuly 19, 2019 at 3:46 pm\n\nActually, many doctors consider themselves scientists first. All valid\nresearch is required to have a specific stated outcome at the start.\n\n      1. John Yonko\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 7:27 am\n\nDr. Maya \u2013 would you consider rephrasing the part of your comment where you\nstate that \u201cAll valid research is required to have a specific stated outcome\nat the start.\u201d? I believe you meant \u2018stated hypothesis\u2019, not \u2018stated goal\u201d The\ngoal of research is to determine whether the stated hypothesis is true or\nfalse.\n\n      2. Lzvolk\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 9:08 am\n\n\u201cActually, many doctors consider themselves scientists first. All valid\nresearch is required to have a specific stated outcome at the start.\u201d\n\nDisagree. And perhaps a naive comment. Nearly all MDs I know often state they\nare not scientists and they rely on extracts or abstracts of medical research.\nAnd most of the same subset also confess they have no time to read medical-\nrelated literature, especially nutritional studies.\n\nAs a long-time research biologist, the belief that \u201call research is required\nto have a specific stated outcome at the start\u201d is naive. Published research,\nyes. However, that is easily manipulated to meet those publishing (and\nfunding) requirements. All studies, all scientific literature, for that\nmatter, should be read and critically evaluated: the methodology, data,\ninterpretation, and, especially the conclusions. Even peer review is not\nalways perfect.\n\nToo many times researchers have manipulated data, interpretations and\nconclusions to fit their stated hypothesis, or altered their stated hypothesis\n(and stated outcome) to match the data. Over the four decades as a scientist,\nI have seen it too often.\n\nAre all scientists then unethical? Are all published studies unreliable? Not\nat all. Most of the media and the lay public lack knowledge to critical\nanalyze scientific literature. We teach students pursuing careers in science\nto critically evaluate and question reported science, and require evidence for\ncriticisms, which often are based in related or non-related fields. Journal\nclubs especially focus on thoroughly dissecting specific studies and their\npublications. Many university tracts in medicine and nutrition do not\nemphasize that degree of scrutiny.\n\nEvery report -agency, media, scientific- should be examined with careful and\nknowledgable scrutiny. That is part of the scientific process.\n\n        1. Lesa\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 12:49 pm\n\nWell put. Thank you for your evaluation.\n\n      3. Carl R\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 9:52 am\n\n\u201cAll valid research is required to have a specific stated outcome at the\nstart.\u201d This is exactly correct, albeit not well stated, which leads to the\nconfusion you can see in the comments that reply to it. Dr. Maya is not saying\nthat you start with a conclusion, and then you make the data show that\nconclusion. What Dr. Maya is saying is that, in order to do valid research,\nyou need to follow a simple three step method: 1. Create a hypothesis (\u201ca\npriori\u201d) 2. Develop a research method that will test that hypothesis 3. Test\nit using entirely new data, excluding any data that was used to create the\nhypothesis\n\nObservational studies tend to break all these rules. They take a set of data,\nand observe it, looking for associations, but skip the important steps, number\n2 and number 3, that are essential to turn it into \u201cresearch\u201d. Consider the\nendive observation above. It\u2019s fine to look at data and think \u201cwow, people in\nthis sample that ate endive weekly got less ovarian cancer\u201d, but that only\ngets you to step one! You now have a hypothesis. The next step is to figure\nout a way to test it, and then to test it, using entirely different data.\nShall we sign up 1000 people and have half agree to eat one cup of cabbage a\nweek, and the other half agree to eat 1 cup of endive a week, and then track\nthem for ten years, including monthly checkups where they verify that they are\nstill eating their cabbage, or their endive, and that the diets of the two\ngroups are otherwise similar? That would work, and now we have a test that,\nalthough imperfect, and difficult, and expensive, can actually hope to test\nwhether eating endive is beneficial.\n\nObservational studies are interesting, but they are not research. All they do\nis help you discover some plausible hypotheses that you may want to actually\ntest.\n\n      4. Brad Franklin\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 1:19 pm\n\nThat\u2019s sadly not true, based on my experience. Most doctors I have come into\ncontact with are woefully ignorant about research on many issues that affect\ntheir patients. I know only one MDs of the dozen+ I know well enough to say\nthey take a scientific approach, they understand statistics, and are unafraid\nto go against the very standardized \u201cguidelines\u201d of their practice based on\ntheir own understanding of the patient\u2019s history and current health.\n\nLike most industries, medicine is mostly populated by people who follow the\ntrends of that industry for good or ill. The exceptional doctors who truly\npractice their art to its fullest are, well, exceptions.\n\n  110. Gina\n\nJuly 19, 2019 at 11:52 am\n\nThis is one of the best articles on \u201cnutrition in the media\u201d I have read in\nquite a while. Maybe the author should have put the word \u201cScience\u201d in quotes\n(?). I have long been frustrated by web click-bait and catch-phrases from TV\npersonalities and news anchors who like to pare down a \u201cstudy\u201d to a few words\nsuch as \u201cnow you can enjoy red wine and chocolate every day!\u201d or \u201cNew study\nsays no amount of alcohol is safe!\u201d or \u201cPut turmeric in EVERTHING\u201d \u201cLeeches\nfor everyone\u201d I can go on! I won\u2019t My point is, Every person need\nindividualized diet needs, but our General health care providers do not have\nthe time or training to provide it and Dietitians are not covered by most\ninsurance. If a person has a medical problem or bloodwork that is out-of-\nnormal range they are given general advice and medication. Generally, this can\nhelp, but for the general population, it can be frustrating and confusing if\nno progress is made. We then read about \u201cstudies\u201d and listen to \u201cDr.\u201d Oz and\nagain get frustrated by spending a whole lot of money on whatever is being\nsold by these guys. Like this article brings to light, the media should take\nit easy on calling these trends \u201cstudies\u201d or \u201cscience\u201d and perhaps recommend\nthat each person consult their own Dr. before changing their diet. We should\nhave better basic nutrition education in schools. GPs should refer people with\nhealth problems to a Registered Dietitian immediately for individualized\nguidance.\n\n    1. Dr. Maya\n\nJuly 19, 2019 at 3:49 pm\n\nActually, Naturopathic doctors have extensive training in nutrition and diet.\nMaybe look one up sometime, you might be very surprised.\n\n      1. Kevin\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 10:14 am\n\nPer your request I decided to look up naturopathic doctors. After thorough\nresearch of the front page of Google, I came to the conclusion that\nnaturopathic doctors aren\u2019t real doctors. On that topic, are you really a\ndoctor? Evidence from your other comments would suggest that you have not\nreceived the same extent of education as other doctors. I am concerned as to\nwhich institution is giving medical doctorates to people who lack a basic\nunderstanding of metabolism.\n\n    2. Emily\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 12:38 pm\n\nThank you Gina! I will become an RD at the end of this year. Nothing against\nGP\u2019s but they often do not have specialized training in nutrition and frankly\nshould not be expected to. I am working hard to support the American Dietetic\nAssociation\u2019s efforts to increase the requirements for becoming an RD in an\neffort to (among other things) convince insurance companies to cover our\nservices. We will still be 10 times cheaper to cover than an MD and I am\nexpecting the resulting benefits to their bottom line will be obvious in time,\nsimply because so many poor (and expensive) health outcomes experienced in the\nUS are either directly related to or influenced by diet. I am expecting GPs\nwill also welcome increased coverage because they are painfully aware they\nthey do not have the time or expertise to properly address nutrition within\ntheir own practice. Currently they make brief nutrition recommendations\nbecause they are being realistic. Side note. By 2021 all RDs will also be\nrequired to have a Masters Degree and I\u2019m not optimistic there will be a\ncommensurate increase in salary so I\u2019m hoping more stakeholders come around\nand I\u2019m thanking you for your recommendation on behalf of my future\nprofession.\n\n  111. Alan D. McIntire\n\nJuly 19, 2019 at 10:51 am\n\nI realize anecdotal evidence is unreliable, but here\u2019s mine. My father had\nbacon and eggs for breakfast every day of his life at least since I can\nrecall.\n\nMy sister drove him to the VA hospital for a check up at age 84. When his\ndoctor said he should eat more fruits and vegetables, he replied, \u201d LOOK, I\u2019m\n84 years old! How much longer do you expect me to live if I start eating that\ncrap?\u201d, leaving his doctor speechless.\n\nMy father just celebrated his 100th birthday on May 8, 2019. I figure why not\nstick to eggs for breakfast?\n\n    1. Kris\n\nJuly 19, 2019 at 1:10 pm\n\nBacon, eggs, and toast? Or just the bacon and eggs? This enquiring mind wants\nto know!\n\n      1.

Kenneth Barley\n\nJuly 19, 2019 at 10:22 am\n\nWhat everyone one is missing is the level of LPa cholesterol in your body. Few\ndoctors test for this and it affects 20% of the world\u2019s population. LPa is the\nsticky LDL cholesterol that is produced by the liver. Its hard to treat and is\nprobably the main cause of many peoples clogged arteries. I had a brother drop\ndead from a heart attack a year ago at age 64. I went and had a heart scan and\nfound I had a 1200 calcium score which is very very bad & 80% of it was in my\nLAD artery(widow maker). Anything above 400 is red alarm bell territory. I am\n63 and a health nut who eats very clean and works out. I just had a orbital\natherectomy to remove the clog and a stent. I now feel great after many months\nof angina and sharp heart pains. Bottom line is that all this crap about\ncholesterol is meaningless if you have this hereditary problem. Get tested and\na heart scan before it\u2019s too late.\n\n    1. B Crawford\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 8:37 am\n\nThis is the unknown factor Ken. The annual medical check-up beats all.

Ravioliollie Kaye\n\nJuly 19, 2019 at 1:05 pm\n\nhere is my take on the difficulty of eating a balanced diet. The majority of\npeople have the t.v. on, (for noise), and what they fail to recognize is the\nfact that their brains \u201chears\u201d each and every commercial. that is to say\nthey\u2019re preprogramed to respond to all of those food based commercials which,\nfor the most part are the products of food scientists, not farmers.\n\n  114. Micki Jacobs\n\nJuly 19, 2019 at 9:13 am\n\nOur obsession with dietary lipids has overlooked the fat soluble vitamins in\nthem to our detriment. Atherosclerotic plaque is accurately measured via CAC\nmeasurements by CT scans...an awkward finding that frequently does not jibe\nwith \u2018traditional risk factors\u2019 and which has made such as AHA/ACC jump\nthrough hoops to accommodate in their incredibly misguided guidelines. This\ncalcium in arteries is highly predictive of death by all causes with a CAC\nscore of zero conferring a 15 year warranty from death by all causes. (!) CAC\nis linearly associated with MACEs. So what makes CAC? Can it regress? One\nthing in CAC etiology is activation of vitamin K-dependent proteins such as\nmatrix gla protein or osteocalcin, which require sufficient K status and a\nlack of interference of the complex processes that make this status. And\nvitamin K2 supplements do regress the plaque in animal models and better K2\nintake has been observed in human assessments to offer reduced cardiovascular\nrisk. K2 is different than vitamin K 1, the form if K we tend to consider to\nthe exclusion of K2...and certainly we have missed what makes endogenously\nmade menaquinone-4 (MK-4). Instead of looking at fats as saturated or\nunsaturated or monosaturated or whatever, let\u2019s look at the nutrients they\ncontain!! And we must also learn that hydrogenation of high K1 oils such as\nsoy or canola oil (novel in human diets, increased exponentially in recent\ntimes along with obesity and diabetes and as an unintended consequence of\ndisparaging saturated fats) creates an aberrant form of vitamin K \u2013\ndihydrophylloquinone \u2013 that doesn\u2019t act properly and thus makes calcium\ndysregulation in arteries because matrix gla protein is not properly\nactivated. Thus, it\u2019s NOT trans fats... it\u2019s dihydrophylloquinone behind the\nobserved ill effects of these ubiquitous novel oils. K1 can make endogenous\nMK-4, but K2 appears to be better. This form of vitamin K2 \u2013 MK-4 \u2013 the form\nof vitamin K highest in us is made endogenously. We eat it, but it is then\ncleaved in the small intestine to become vitamin K3, menadione, which is\ntransported via the lymph system to bodywide tissues where an enzyme, UBIAD1,\nconverts the K3 to MK-4. This enzyme also controls calcium behavior and\ncholesterol...in CKD patients, who tend to have calcium dysregulation, K2\nsupplements reduced cholesterol and when supplements stopped, cholesterol rose\nagain. Dietary K is processed this way, tearing it apart to create K3 and\npackaged in chylomicrons to transport in lymph but how much and the factors\nthat affect this are still unknown. Some is also transported seemingly\ndirectly in blood. My criticism of much here is the belief that we eat\nsomething and it goes directly to blood as this. It doesn\u2019t work this way.\nEven silly guidelines on cholesterol \u2013 and I could argue that all our\nobsessions with it are missing what is downstream that makes its levels, so we\nare chasing the wrong things \u2013 now realize that consumption of cholesterol is\nnot what makes serum levels and that the liver makes it mostly, which should\nbe affected by homeostatic mechanisms. So back to calcium regulation:\nEndocrinology sees PTH Nutrition folks see lipids Heart folks see cholesterol\nEtc. All are missing these huge issues surrounding vitamin K2. It\u2019s intimately\ninvolved in calcium regulation. MK-4 is a hormone...binds SXR. K2 appears to\nbe intimately involved in obesity, cardiovascular disease, cancer, CKD, liver\nfunction, brain function and more. Go search! Be amazed! Ask about foods\ndifferently than here. And ask about all the additives in ultraprocessed\nfoods- emulsifiers, colors, sweeteners, anti-mold ingredients- and what they\ndo to guts, microbes and the processes I discussed. Ask what drugs do, too. We\nare seeing it all wrong.\n\n    1. Will\n\nJuly 19, 2019 at 9:22 am\n\nI didn\u2019t read your whole post. I stopped as soon as you claimed that coronary\nartery calcium scans can identify atherosclerotic plaques, because while that\nmay be true of plaques which are calcified, many (perhaps most)\natherosclerotic lesions are not calcified. Calcification doesn\u2019t always occur,\nand there\u2019s even debate as to whether or not calcification stabilizes or\ndestabilizes plaques.\n\n    2. mark knudsen\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 6:52 am\n\nWait, what?\n\n    3.

I have been avoiding surgery on a\nclogged carotid artery for at least five years with the use of K2. Regulating\ncalcium and keeping calcium in your bones instead of the arteries. The body is\nconstantly trying to achieve balance of ph. When we eat a lot of acid causing\nfoods our body has to compensate by taking it from the bones. It may end up in\nthe arteries as the patch for inflamation along with cholesterol.\n\n  115. S. Cheatham\n\nJuly 18, 2019 at 6:28 pm\n\nI\u2019m tired of this at this point.

There is\na big difference in nutrient content in the meat and the eggs they lay when it\ncomes to commercially raised hens cooped up indoors that eat just grains vs\npasture raised free roaming chickens that also eat bugs and grub. The same\ngoes for farm raised vs wild caught fish, grain fed vs grass fed cows and the\nlist goes on with mass agricultural farming practices. I personally don\u2019t eat\neggs unless I know where the chickens come from. I get my eggs when I can from\nfarms where chickens roam free and when I do I have no qualms eating 4 eggs a\nday.

Where you come up with it being menstruation is\nreally bizarre. It is never in contact with blood and only becomes unclean to\neat if it has a blood spot in it. (consumption of blood is forbidden) The\nprescribed method of eating it does not include breaking it open unless it was\nbaked or boiled first. Science today seems hell bent on teaching us to abandon\neating clean foods which included red meat such as beef, lamb, goat, deer,\netc. We are not supposed to eat pork which as a white meat is often pushed on\nus as being healthier that red meat. Most of the traditional foods are being\nabandoned for vegetarian diets and those high in scavenger based meats. All\nquite contradictory to the Divinely prescribed diets. All a person has to do\nis eat what is to be meat for us and avoid that which is unhealthy and not\nintended to be received. You are what you eat; a scavenger such as catfish,\neels, and filter feeders such as shellfish are full of the filth they clean up\nand out of our water. I like a little of it once in a while but I have no\ndesire to drink my water by sucking it out of the dirty side of my water\nfilter. An egg is clean and and can be consumed as food but maybe part of the\nway they benefit us is in the way they are prepared. Maybe frying them in a\npool of bacon grease is not as good as hard boiled or baked. If my Lord said I\nshould eat them and some scientist or doctor or someone who thinks they are\nmenstruation says I shouldn\u2019t eat them, to whom should I listen.

I ate\nvegetarian. A ate vegan. I ate low fat. I ate no fat (ornish).\n\nObserving the rise in obesity and diabetes and my frustrations with supposedly\nhealthy/weight loss diets, I made up my own. I drank only water, ate lean\nproteins, healthy fats (olive, avocado, oily fish), plenty of low glycemic\nvegetables that grow above ground, an occasional piece of whole fruit, and\nnothing that I had to cook a while to make edible. Low glycemic foods.\nUnderstanding metabolic syndrome, blood sugar spikes, insulin response, etc. I\naimed for a low and slow blood sugar curve.\n\nI lost 95lbs, actually getting too thin, and my blood tests went from bad to\npristine. And I've maintained that diet easily, its not particularly\nrestrictive, and my weight and blood tests remain good.\n\nUnfortunately peoples ideas of what are good and bad foods gets flipped over\nby bad nutritional studies and advice that changes every few months. And the\nformat in which we eat foods, healthy or not, can also be problematic. For\nexample if I eat a big salad, it takes hours to digest and release its\nnutrients. If I put those ingredients in a juicer or blender, they're absorbed\nwithin 15 minutes. You pee out half the vitamins, get less hard to digest\nfiber, and your digestive tracts gets a shotgun of nutrients when its not\nbuilt to function that way. Similarly, a \"healthy\" food like oatmeal is worth\na look. A whole groat or steel cut oats (looks like a bit of rice and pieces\nof rice respectively) have a glycemic index of 50. A steamed rolled \"old\nfashioned/microwavable/instant\" oat has a glycemic index in the low 70's.\nWhite table sugar is 67.\n\nMy advice? Eat the eggs, skip the instant oatmeal.\n\n    1. Working Dad\n\nJuly 19, 2019 at 8:51 am\n\nI think this a good point. I don \u0301t know if it can be said that eggs are\nhealthy or not on an absolute basis, but we can look at them on a relative\nbasis compared to our other options. I feed my kids breakfast every morning. I\nhave readily available to me option 1) some sugary, processed breakfast cereal\ndoused in milk, 2) instant oatmeal topped with a little butter and brown\nsugar, or 3) scrambled eggs with some whole grain toast. The eggs, I feel, are\nthe better option of the three and the oatmeal better than the cereal. Like\nmost things in life, it\u2019s relative.\n\nIn reality, I rotate through multiple breakfast items during the week\nincluding some other options I didn\u2019t mention, but it never includes breakfast\ncereal. I think variety is key and diet is only half the equation. If you\ndon\u2019t get enough exercise, having a good diet doesn\u2019t get you very far.\n\n  121.

They barely skim the surface\nof nutrition in Medical School. Dieticians and certainly one with a PHD in\nfood science have much greater knowledge regarding food, nutrition and how\nvarious diseases affect the food absorption process. In addition food science\ndegrees have a greater chemistry requirement than someone trying to get into\nmedical school. If one cooks eggs in bacon grease then eggs are very\nunhealthy. How he can say eggs are unhealthy when they are full of B vitamins,\ncontain the greatest source of choline which is a precursor to Acetalcholine\nand the egg yolk contains a high amount of high density lipoprotein (the good\ncholesterol) is ludicrous. If you have a high cholesterol health issue then\nyou have to limit the amount of eggs you eat in one week. If you exercise and\nstrength train you increase the good cholesterol in your body.\n\n      1. Kalnius DiGrandi\n\nJuly 18, 2019 at 2:43 pm\n\nCorrection...Dr Greger\n\n      2.

There are very few industry people (a\ncouple are in the food services industry but are not directly tied to certain\nbrands such as Coke). Most are professors/university department heads and\nindividuals who own their own nutrition consulting practices. The ADA has\nethical guidelines and can and does revoke membership based upon these\nguidelines (I\u2019m not saying they are prefect). It\u2019s possible you are confusing\nthe accrediting agency (the ADA), with governmental entities such as the USDA.\nIf you have evidence that any one of these individuals have a direct and\nconflicting relationship with one of the \u201cbig agra\u201d companies you mention, I\u2019d\nbe interested in hearing about it.

We are actively encouraged to rely on information from a\nvariety of sources in our practice and taught how to scrutinize information\nfrom the literature. We are also taught about how various governmental\nagencies and research organizations can be influenced by the food industry.\nMembers of AMA (American Medical Association) can also have possible conflicts\nof interest and the organization itself has put out misleading statements in\nthe past. Does that mean all MDs are not to be trusted? Is there a possibility\na few RDs are giving their clients at least some information that may be\nmisleading (intentionally or unintentionally)? You bet. Does this hold true\nfor all healthcare related professions? You bet. Is the better alternative to\nexperiment on yourself for the vast majority of people who have minimal basic\nscientific education and almost none specifically related to human nutrition.\nI would argue no.\n\n    2.

No mention of the\nfact that animal fats cause type 2 diabetes. No mention of how animal fats\nblock insulin receptors. No mention of the effect on elasticity to the\narteries immediately after consuming fatty foods which include animal fats and\nprocessed cooking oils including olive oil. There is no special nutrition\nfound in an egg that cant be found in a healthier source like plant base\nfoods. Then you have the China study.

Kalnius DiGrandi\n\nJuly 18, 2019 at 10:04 am\n\nEggs by themselves are very nutritious. Yes, eggs contain a great amount of\ncholesterol but most of the cholesterol is high density lipoprotein which is\nthe good cholesterol. In the past it was the large amounts of bacon, sausage\nand buttered on fiber depleted white bread toast. Cholesterol is actually\nquite good for men\u2019s testosterone if they lead a healthy lifestyle and\nmaintain a lower body fat percentage. The problem is automation has made\nAmericans less physically active and Americans waistline and obesity rates\nhave increased and continue to increase. Only one third of all Americans are\nactive at least 3 times a week. I personally eat a Mediterranean type diet,\nhit the gym 6 days a week and consume 4 to 6 eggs a day. I have my blood\ntested every 3 months and I am in excellent health. I also follow the\nphilosophy of Hippocrates \u201cThe Father of Modern Medicine\u201d Let food be thy\nmedicine and medicine be thy food\u201d I eat to live not live to eat.\n\n    1. Kalnius DiGrandi\n\nJuly 18, 2019 at 10:26 am\n\nA few corrections to my comment. The large amount of sausage, bacon and\nbuttered fiber depleted processed white bread toast in the past was more\ndetrimental to the human body than the eggs. I am 56 years of age and in\nexcellent health. Calories in/calories out \u201cThe law of thermodynamics is the\nbest dietary advice for a healthier lifestyle if a Mediterranean diet is not\nyour choice.\n\n      1. cfbcfb\n\nJuly 18, 2019 at 1:43 pm\n\nA common misperception. Your body is not a furnace and responds to different\nfoods in different forms differently and different types of calories are\nhandled differently.\n\nIf I eat a certain amount of calories of a lean protein and vegetables, I\u2019ll\nget a limited blood sugar kick, it\u2019ll stay flat and take hours to digest.\n\nIf I eat a bunch of bread and instant oatmeal, it\u2019ll be rapidly converted into\nblood sugar, triggering an insulin response that tells your body to store the\nexcess blood sugar as fat.\n\nIf I cut calories and work out more, your body will hang onto that fat for\ndear life as it enters \u201csurvival mode\u201d, preserving fat stores while consuming\nmuscle tissue.\n\nThe laws of thermodynamics do NOT apply to the human body.\n\n        1. Kalnius\n\nJuly 18, 2019 at 3:11 pm\n\nGranted you have young individuals with fast metabolisms who consume mega\ncalories and never gain a pound. But on the average person and or a person in\ntheir mid 20s if you burn more calories than you take in there is a much\ngreater chance you will lose weight whether it is lean muscle tissue and or\nbodyfat. There is no such thing as a fat burning cycle with regards to cardio\nexercise. It was proven to be a myth. The human body is much like an\nautomobile. After exercising the body targets the bodyfat while it is cooling\ndown much like an automobile as it parked after driving it out on the highway.\nAlso the more lean muscle tissue one possesses the greater basal metabolic\nrate (more calories burnt at rest) I have worked with many dieticians, was\nengaged to PHD in Nutrition and I know many Naturopathic Physicians. I myself\nhave completed 75 percent of my Exercise Science /Pre Physical Therapy degree\nwith a minor in Nutrition. I am also a Certified Personal Trainer with the\nNASM organization in addition to being specialized in CES, PES, Nutrition,\nLadies Fitness, Senior Fitness and group fitness. What are your credentials?\n\n        2. Kalnius\n\nJuly 19, 2019 at 8:31 am\n\nYou are correct regarding the law of thermodynamics not being applicable to\nthe human body. It was an older concept from the late 1990\u2019s and early 2000s\nbut proven wrong shortly thereafter. I understand insulin and fat storage\nconcepts and that each food item consumed is processed a little different in\nthe human body. I should have left that statement out of comment.\n\n    2. Lewis Goudy\n\nJuly 18, 2019 at 12:23 pm\n\n>eggs contain a great amount of cholesterol but most of the cholesterol is\nhigh density lipoprotein<\n\nThat's nonsense. LDL and HDL are particles in your blood. They got there\nbecause your body manufactured them for its own purposes. You don't get them\nfrom your diet like you get your potassium. If you drink blood you are\nconsuming them, but they don't survive digestion and end up in your blood like\npotassium does. They are digested just like any other protein.\n\nRaw food cultists believe that heating carrots to the point that its enzymes\nare denatured destroys their nutritional value. Those enzymes are digested\njust like any other protein you eat is (and one might wonder what use carrot\nenzymes would be to a human in the first place since they don't serve any\npurpose of ours and would simply elicit an immune response to a foreign\nmolecule if they did make it to the bloodstream, perhaps pursuant to carrot\njuice self-injection by a particularly zealous raw foodist).l\n\nThere is a term for magical thinking of this sort: cargo cult.\n\n      1. Kalnius\n\nJuly 18, 2019 at 3:24 pm\n\nWhat is your medical or nutrition background? Take a nutrition course or two\nand you might learn something valid. Those that exercise also increase their\nHDL\u2019s. Not to mention helps control one\u2019s blood suagr levels. I guess my\nfriends who are dieticians and Naturopaths don\u2019t know squat in comparison to\nyourself.\n\n      2. Kalnius\n\nJuly 18, 2019 at 3:39 pm\n\nA small amount of heat actually helps break down the cellular wall in many\nvegetables which is a good thing as it releases more vitamins and minerals. It\nparticularly applies to cruciferous vegetables. I steam my vegetables for 30\nseconds in a microwave while covered in wax paper. Vitamin C is highly heat\nsensitive. Over Cooking vegetables offers very little vitamin and mineral\ncontent.\n\n        1. Jim S\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 1:02 pm\n\nIf you\u2019re \u201cmicrowaving\u201d your food, you\u2019re destroying anywhere from 60 \u2013 90\npercent of the nutritive value!\n\n          1. GG\n\nJuly 21, 2019 at 10:06 pm\n\nProve it Reeks of exaggeration and substantiated purely by word of mouth.\nPlease go elsewhere.\n\n      3. Kalnius\n\nJuly 18, 2019 at 4:27 pm\n\nI guess I will have to admit I am wrong regarding the HDL content in eggs.\nEating an egg or eggs does have a positive effect with the liver releasing HDL\ninto one\u2019s bloodstream. Even when people ate three or more eggs per day their\nbodies made bigger LDL- and HDL-lipoprotein particles than when they ate no\neggs. That\u2019s important because other recent studies have suggested that larger\nLDLs are less likely than small ones to enter artery walls and contribute\ntheir cholesterol load to artery-clogging plaque. Similarly, larger HDLs are\nmore robust than smaller ones at hauling cholesterol out of the bloodstream\nand, ultimately out of the body.\n\n    3. Dave B.\n\nJuly 18, 2019 at 1:58 pm\n\nPretty sure 4-6 eggs per day (!) doesn\u2019t fit the definition of Mediterranean\ndiet.\n\n      1. Kalnius\n\nJuly 18, 2019 at 3:18 pm\n\nThe eggs maybe not. But i do consume fatty fish, olive oil, avocado, and\nplenty of fruit and vegetables on a daily basis.

If they\nwere, that word would be included within any advertising campaign created to\nsupport them. Do you know what other word you will not find as part of any egg\nadvertising? Healthy.

Sr. Tech Writer\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 8:51 am\n\n\u201cDo you think the American Heart Association is purposely lying to the\npublic?\u201d I can answer your question. Just show me the funding listings for the\nAHA and for any \u2018study\u2019 the AHA approves. When I see that not one single\ncommercial enterprise has contributed to their funding, I will accept the AHA\npronouncements without question.\n\n\u201cTo what end?\u201d It appears that you have no concept of the \u2018funding -> desired\noutcome -> more (or continued) funding\u2019 economic cycle in research fields.\nThose researchers are earning a living, and quite predictably they want to\ncontinue to get paid. Achieving a result that is contrary to what the funding\nsource wants results in withdrawal of the funding ... and having to go find a\nnew job. Successive rounds of job-seeking results in lower (or no) wages due\nto \u201cunreliable\u201d job performance. This is true in ANY field of research.\n\nMany years ago, I did a study for Control Data Corp. The object of the study\nwas to discover a reliable way to detect when a disk drive read/write head\ncrashed against the surface of the spinning disk (they normally \u2018fly\u2019 on a\nthin boundary layer of air).\n\nMy study came to the inescapable conclusion that a little heat probe built\ninto a head could do the job with about 99.8% reliability. But that added\n$6.72 to the cost of each head, in a machine that had dozens of heads in\nmultiple disk stacks.\n\nAnother study determined that it was possible to detect the sound of a head\nticking against the surface. Reliability was only about 41%, but the cost was\nonly $19.95 for a cheap microphone from Radio Shack per disk stack. The\ndetection reliability sort of sucked, but hey ... the customers were VERY\nimpressed that an audio system could detect ANY crashes.\n\nGuess which system went into the machines.\n\nWrong. NEITHER system was implemented. The corporate marketing team determined\nfrom their own study that it was more financially beneficial to CDC to insist\nthat customers increase the frequency of the routine maintenance which\ninvolved taking a drive off line and meticulously cleaning it. CDC received\nfinancial rewards for doing the more frequent maintenance cycles.\n\nI was out of a job.\n\n      3. tom calarco\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 11:38 am\n\nTo promote the use of statins.\n\n      4.

The AHA is made up of individuals from many different backgrounds, each\nwith their own agenda. This agenda is not necessarily a malicious one, however\nwe all have agendas and when many agendas either conscious or unconscious are\nat play, things get complicated. 2. Nutrition science is complicated. See\narticle and postings as an example. 3. Many in the public lack the resources,\neducation, time, and motivation to learn even the simplest nutrition concepts\nfor reasons way to numerous to get into here. This is not a judgement of these\npeople, it is simply a fact. These organizations have to keep the message\nsimple in order to have any hope of producing meaningful behavior change. 4.\nIt takes time for consensus to be established in these organizations and they\nare often behind the \u201clatest research\u201d. You might think research that is 10-20\nyears old is, well, old news. But in order to develop an informed consensus,\nthese organizations need to wait for follow up studies to be conducted. This\nis time consuming. They also have to weigh the benefit of being more pro-\nactive with the risks. Currently there are very few known risks to consuming\nLESS cholesterol, so I believe they are still erring on the side of caution.\nWhether or not they\u2019ve waited too long is debatable.\n\nAs a public health professional with a biological sciences background who will\nbe a practicing RD (Registered Dietitian) next year, this is obviously\nfrustrating. In my dietetics program there are still professors who will\ncontradict each other on this point. I could be wrong, but this is my theory\nbased on my education and professional experience.\n\n      5. Dr. J\n\nJuly 20, 2019 at 12:14 pm\n\nThe American Heart Association (AHA) is funded by huge amounts of money from\nvarious corporations whose interests are not the health of the American public\nbut to make a profit.

Then, starting in\nthe late 1970s and early 1980s, it began to be disparaged as a dangerous\nsource of artery-clogging cholesterol, a probable culprit behind Americans\u2019\nexceptionally high rates of heart attack and stroke. Then, in the past few\nyears, the chicken egg was redeemed and once again touted as an excellent\nsource of protein, unique antioxidants like lutein and zeaxanthin, and many\nvitamins and minerals, including riboflavin and selenium, all in a fairly low-\ncalorie package.\n\nThis March, a study published in JAMA put the egg back on the hot seat. It\nfound that the amount of cholesterol in a bit less than two large eggs a day\nwas associated with an increase in a person\u2019s risk of cardiovascular disease\nand death by 17 percent and 18 percent, respectively. The risks grow with\nevery additional half egg. It was a really large study, too \u2014 with nearly\n30,000 participants \u2014 which suggests it should be fairly reliable.\n\nSo which is it? Is the egg good or bad? And, while we are on the subject, when\nso much of what we are told about diet, health, and weight loss is\ninconsistent and contradictory, can we believe any of it?\n\nQuite frankly, probably not. Nutrition research tends to be unreliable because\nnearly all of it is based on observational studies, which are imprecise, have\nno controls, and don\u2019t follow an experimental method. As nutrition-research\ncritics Edward Archer and Carl Lavie have put it, \u201c\u2019Nutrition\u2019 is now a\ndegenerating research paradigm in which scientifically illiterate methods,\nmeaningless data, and consensus-driven censorship dominate the empirical\nlandscape.\u201d\n\nOther nutrition research critics, such as John Ioannidis of Stanford\nUniversity, have been similarly scathing in their commentary. They point out\nthat observational nutrition studies are essentially just surveys: Researchers\nask a group of study participants \u2014 a cohort \u2014 what they eat and how often,\nthen they track the cohort over time to see what, if any, health conditions\nthe study participants develop.\n\nThe trouble with the approach is that no one really remembers what they ate.\nYou might remember today\u2019s breakfast in some detail. But, breakfast three days\nago, in precise amounts? Even the unadventurous creature of habit would\nprobably get it wrong. That tends to make these surveys inaccurate, especially\nwhen researchers try to drill down to specific foods.\n\nThen, that initial inaccuracy is compounded when scientists use those guesses\nabout eating habits to calculate the precise amounts of specific proteins and\nnutrients that a person consumed. The errors add up, and they can lead to\nseriously dubious conclusions.\n\nA good example is the 2005 study that suggested that eating a cup of endive\nonce a week might cut a woman\u2019s risk of ovarian cancer by 76 percent. There\nwas even a possible mechanism to explain the effect: Endive is high in\nkaempferol, a flavonoid that has shown anticarcinogenic properties in\nlaboratory experiments. It was a big study, based on a cohort of more than\n62,000 women. This study was published in the prestigious journal Cancer, and\nmany in the media were convinced. Dr. Mehmet Oz even touted it on his\ntelevision show.\n\nBut, as Maki Inoue-Choi, of the University of Minnesota, and her colleagues\npointed out, the survey had asked about many other kaempferol-rich foods \u2014\nincluding some that had higher levels of kaempferol than endive does \u2014 and not\none of those other foods had the same apparent effect on ovarian cancer.\n\nThe new study linking eggs and cardiovascular disease deserves similar\nscrutiny. Statistically speaking, 30,000 participants makes for a very\npowerful study. And in fairness, the study\u2019s defenders say that it did a good\njob accounting for factors that might have influenced the findings, such as\noverall fat consumption, smoking, and lifestyle.\n\nBut on the other hand, the study tracked participants\u2019 health outcomes over\nperiods ranging from 13 to more than 30 years, and participants were queried\nabout their diet only once, at the beginning of the study. Can we assume that\nthe participants gave a reliable depiction of their diet at the outset, and\nthen that they maintained that same diet for the years \u2014 in many cases,\ndecades \u2014 that followed? Probably not. Who eats the same way for 10 years?\n\nIn light of these flaws, Dr. Anthony Pearson, a cardiologist at St. Luke\u2019s\nHospital in suburban St. Louis, had this advice: \u201cRather than drastically\ncutting egg consumption,\u201d he wrote in a blog for MedPage Today, \u201cI propose\nthat there be a drastic cut in the production of weak observational nutrition\nstudies and a moratorium on inflammatory media coverage of meaningless\nnutritional studies.\u201d\n\nInstead of observational studies, most nutrition scientists would rather see\nexperimental studies like those performed by the late Dr. Jules Hirsch. A\npioneer in the study of obesity, Hirsch got his start in the 1950s, long\nbefore weight control became the problem that it is today. He took a\nrelatively unglamorous, ignored area of medical health and made it extremely\ninteresting. To this day, his controlled experiments on human nutrition are\nconsidered a gold-standard in nutrition science. He discovered that when a\nperson diets, their heart rate slows, they feel cold, and their immune system\nis undermined.\n\nBut here\u2019s the rub: Hirsch worked at Rockefeller University \u2014 a serene little\ncampus tucked away on the Upper East Side of Manhattan \u2014 where researchers are\nfree to follow their muse, free of teaching duties. Rockefeller University\nalso has a hospital. Between that and the endowment support, Hirsch was able\nto do research that would have been impractical to do virtually anywhere else.\n\nHirsch started with basic science, looking at fat cells and how they\nfunctioned. Then he moved on to patients. He would admit them to the\nuniversity hospital and keep them there, assigning them to a metabolic ward\nwhere he could control nearly everything they ate. That was critical, because\nit is really hard to be on a restricted diet, and there are temptations.\n\nIn perhaps his most famous study, Hirsch admitted 18 obese men and women to\nthe hospital together with 23 people who had never been obese. He fed them all\nmostly a liquid diet to control their calories precisely. First, he had them\nmaintain their initial weight and took measurements. Then he had them gain 10\npercent of their initial weight and took measurements. Finally, he limited\ntheir portions, causing them to go at least 10 percent below their initial\nweight, and repeated the measurements a third time.\n\nThe experiment revealed the now-well-known fact that when an individual loses\nweight, their metabolism slows. That\u2019s what makes it so hard to lose weight \u2014\nand to keep the weight off afterward.\n\nUnfortunately, it is impractical \u2014 and probably impossible \u2014 for most\nresearchers to carry out those types of studies on a large scale. Crunching\nthe data from a big observational study is a much easier way to get a\npublication and some media attention. So we get what we get.\n\nIn the meantime, what do the rest of us do with our diets?\n\nMost experts recommend avoiding processed foods as much as possible and\nsticking with a Mediterranean-like diet because it makes intuitive sense. It\nis not too restrictive. It is heavy in fruits and vegetables. It has the right\nkinds of fats and some grains. It includes fish and generally lean proteins.\n\nThese experts contend that you should also be wary about foods that are said\nto have newly revealed healthy, or unhealthy, properties. In other words,\ndon\u2019t buy the notion of superfoods. The evidence is just not there.\n\nIn an email, Michael Blaha, a cardiologist at Johns Hopkins University who has\nwritten about methodological issues with nutritional science, told me he finds\n\u201cparticularly distasteful studies of one particular food (e.g., broccoli) or\none particular macronutrient,\u201d because \u201cit is impossible to disentangle the\neffect of one particular food or one macronutrient from the accompanying foods\nand macronutrients that characterize a typical dietary pattern.\u201d\n\nTo put it another way: Eat what you like but keep it balanced. And, perhaps,\nlong live the omelet!\n\nTimothy F. Kirn is a freelance writer based in Sacramento, California.
