It's like a UPS (uninterruptable power supply) that primarily charges from sunshine. We don't even notice power outages or public safety shut-offs anymore (same would go snowstorm outages or hurricane outages elsewhere).\n  * Saves you money the rest of the year until the sun is down & battery is empty, then falls back to the grid. It generally pays for itself in 4 years with those savings.\n\n## Benefits\n\n  * Built To Go - take it with you if you move. Throw it in the back of a truck. Nothing is permanently attached or wired in. The Sunpower T5s are built to withstand up to 120 mph winds while lying on the roof.\n  * Landlord-friendly - Non destructively place panels on your roof without making holes. I did ask my landlord for permission as a common courtesy.\n  * Plug-in Hybrid - In normal operation the system runs off solar & battery, but can seamlessly flip to utility pass-through mode if both other sources are exhausted. Like a plug-in hybrid car can avoid range anxiety with a backup gas engine for long trips, the system removes the worry of running out of power if you go over your self-generation that day.\n  * Utility-friendly - This system is off-grid as far as the utility is concerned. It never feeds back into the grid, only ever drawing if necessary.\n\n## Tracking\n\nYou can track the usage and inputs with an app - I got a (bad and expensive)\ntracker dongle but I'd strongly recommend Solar Assistant\n\n## Stored sunlight runs the place\n\nStored sunlight runs my kitchen, dining & living room - fridge, induction\nstove (Ikea, placed on gas stove), kettle, entertainment system, and\neverything else. It could also run microwaves and space heaters. It doesn't\nrun my lights - it's a PITA to get an alternate power system to everywhere I\nwant lights. But LEDs nowadays are in the 2-5 watt range, so consumption of\nthose is minimal. The system powers all of my high-power devices above, which\nmakes a way bigger dent with fewer cables.\n\n## The Secret Sauce\n\nThe secret sauce is that the sunbox is usually off-grid and never pushes power\nback into the grid. The only reason it's connected to the wall at all is that\nif it runs out of power it can pull energy from the wall. The sunbox (and its\nsatellite on the roof - the solar panels) are acting as a \"solar buffer\"\nbetween your devices and the wall. It's not wired into the meter, doesn't\nrequire a permit, etc.\n\nWall plug for pass-through UPS mode & cables through window-gap to solar\npanels\n\n## The Downside\n\nThe potential downside is that you need to run your own \"alternate electricity\nsystem\" through the house (ie. long white extension cables) to each room, as\nyou're side-stepping the house's built-in wiring in the walls and using your\nown that you can redirect to the sunbox.\n\nMain 2,500W power distribution strip. Relatively neat wiring from the box to\nthe fridge, induction cooktop and on to the living room.\n\n## Components & Cost - $1,124 total\n\n$200 for 1.2kW solar (used) - 4 x 320W Sunpower T5s @ $50 - though if there's\nno used panels near you then new ones 4 x 455W = $746 is great too\n\n$494 for 3kW inverter/controller/UPS all-in-one - 3kW pure sine wave inverter,\n4kW MPPT solar charge controller, UPS function - falls back to grid when\nbattery empty\n\n$418 for 2.5kWh LiFePo4 battery\n\nCables / Tender:\n\n  * https://amzn.to/43NkcuJ - $14.79\n  * https://amzn.to/4cwxY8Y - $30.42\n  * https://amzn.to/4cuS3fx - $13.00\n  * https://amzn.to/43u3ikz x2 - $17.00\n  * https://amzn.to/43u3r7B - $12.99\n  * https://amzn.to/43y5Qhx - $8.89\n  * Total: $114.09\n\n=> $1,124 total\n\nRemote tracking (optional):\n\n  * https://amzn.to/3Vs3COI - $7.99\n  * https://amzn.to/3TPaXGI - $23.92\n  * https://amzn.to/4a6UMdI - $6.99\n  * https://solar-assistant.io - $55.83\n  * Total (additional): $94.73\n\n### How to guide\n\nComing soon, for now refer to Will Prowse\u2019s wiring guide on his very-similar\n48V 3000W off-grid solar system which I followed and works great for me!\n\n### Financial Payback & Embodied Energy\n\n    \n    \n    Financial payback period for 3000W System cost : $1,124 on Amazon in 2024 Yearly energy creation: 365d * 4.26hsun/d * 1.280kW = 2,000kWh/y (but more like 1,000kWh/year after losses) Yearly value creation: 1,000kWh/y * $0.55/kWh in SF = $550/y energy created 100W system payback period: $1,124 / $550 = 2 years until payback\n\n### How green is it:\n\nProduction footprint PV (source): 2,900kWhee/kW * 1.28kW = 3,712kWh embodied\nenergy\n\nProduction footprint LiFePo4 battery (source): 106kWhee/kWh * 2.4kWh = 254kWh\nembodied energy\n\nAnnual energy production system: 1100kWh/y Payback period: 3966kWh / 1100kWh/y\n= 3.5 year footprint payback\n\n### FAQ\n\nWhat\u2019s the catch? Seems to good to be true? Well, this thing sits between your\ndevices and the wall. So you need to neatly run extension cables from every\nroom in the house to the \u201csun box\u201d, and then run one cable from the box to the\npanels, and another to the wall (optional, just so it can fall back to pulling\npower from the wall). Photos of this are coming soon.\n\nWill it ever push power back into the wall? Nope! It\u2019ll only ever draw from\nthe wall in the event that both the sun is down and the battery is dead (so\nyour fridge won\u2019t go off overnight for example).\n\nIs this legal? Yes, see above. No difference to plugging your fridge into your\nwall, as far as the utility is concerned.\n\n## Want some help?\n\nSet up a call with us and we can plan your system!\n\nEmail Us\n\nSubmitting...\n\n### Thank you!\n\n  * Home Solar Kit\n  * Mini Solar Kit\n  * Grid-tied Solar Panel\n  * About\n  * Blog\n  * Contact\n\n  * Shipping\n  * Refunds, Returns & Warranty\n\n\u00a9 sunboxlabs 2021.
