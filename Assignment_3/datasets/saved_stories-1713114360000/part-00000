We are pleased to announce that Fortran-lang is now officially\nfiscally sponsored by NumFOCUS 1, joining the likes of many other great\norganisations such as Numpy, SciPy, PETSc and LFortran.\n\nBeing fiscally sponsored by NumFOCUS means that Fortran-lang will now have\naccess to a number of resources that will help us grow and improve the\ncommunity. This includes the ability to accept donations, managed by NumFOCUS\n(more on how that works soon!), applying for grants through the Small\nDevelopment Grants 2 program, access to the NumFOCUS network of projects and\ncontributors, along with legal, financial and marketing support.\n\nWe are still figuring out exactly how to use all these new resources, and\nthere is still some work to be done to get everything set up, but we are\nreally excited about what this means for the future of Fortran-lang!\n\nA big thank you from the Fortran-lang team (@certik, @milancurcic, @awvwgk,\n@lkedward and @gnikit) to all the amazing community members, contributors, and\nsupporters who helped us get here. We\u2019ll keep you posted on any new\ndevelopments!\n\nNumFOCUS\n\n### Fortran-lang - NumFOCUS 14\n\nFortran-lang is an open-source community that builds and maintains a set of\nmodern tools and libraries for Fortran developers.\n\nEst. reading time: 3 minutes\n\n### Related Topics\n\nTopic| Replies| Views| Activity  \n---|---|---|---  \nDiscussion: Applying to NumFOCUS - Deadline: 15 October 2022Meta| 1.5k| Jan 8  \nNew Fortran-lang paperAnnouncements| 628| Sep 2021  \nOptions for funding Fortran-Lang projectsMeta| 1.7k| Sep 2022  \nFortran-lang Roadmap IdeasMeta| 439| Oct 2022  \nRequest for feedback: GSoC 2022 Fortran-lang Org applicationGSoC-2022| 565|\nFeb 2022  \n  \nPowered by Discourse\n\n", "frontpage": false}
