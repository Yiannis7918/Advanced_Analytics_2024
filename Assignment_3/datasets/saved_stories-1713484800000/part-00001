Synopsys and OpenLight Present First PCIe 7.0\nData-Rate-Over-Optics Demo\n\nKeivan Javadi Khasraghi, Priyank Shukla\n\nApr 09, 2024 / 3 min read\n\nTable of Contents\n\n  * Transitioning to PCIe Over Fiber Optics\n\n  * Benefits and Challenges of PCIe Over Optics\n\nThe transition of PCIe over optical interfaces heralds a breakthrough for low-\nlatency operations. As a key player in the PCI Special Interest Group (PCI-\nSIG), Synopsys is deeply involved in actively helping develop a new standard.\nThe wheels of change are in motion for the Peripheral Component Interconnect\nExpress (PCIe) standard, with transformative implications for the chip design\nprocess.\n\nThe PCI-SIG formation of a PCIe Optical Workgroup, announced last August,\nmeans that PCIe is set to transcend the practical limitations of copper\nsignaling. The group sees optical, light-based interfaces as integral to the\nfuture of PCIe. This shift carries multiple prospective advantages, including\nexpanded ranges and data rates and reduced power requirements.\n\n## The Transition to PCIe Over Fiber Optics\n\nThe goal is to standardize the implementation of PCIe over fiber optics while\nkeeping the field open to a broad swathe of optical technologies. There is\nalso talk of evolving the card electromechanical (CEM) connector toward an\noptical-based solution as a means to deliver PCIe.\n\nHowever, while full ecosystem change will not be instantaneous, we can be sure\nthat it is coming and prepare accordingly. With this in mind, Synopsys has\nbeen an active participant in the PCI-SIG Workgroup (as well as the only IP\ncompany on the board of directors) and is working with OpenLight Photonics, a\nleader in integrated silicon photonics technology, to develop tools that will\nenable a smooth transition.\n\nFigure 1: Synopsys PCIe PHY demonstrates non-retimed linear-drive PCIe 7.0\ndata-rate Electro-Optical-Electro Link\n\nAt the recent Optical Fiber Communication Conference and Exposition (OFC) in\nSan Diego, Synopsys and OpenLight brought two data center energy-efficient\nsolutions to life. In the first demonstration, Synopsys showcased both a PCIe\n7.0 and PCIe 6.0 over Optics with OpenLight\u2019s Photonics IC delivering PCIe at\na rate of 128 and 64 gigatransfers per second (GT/s) correspondingly. The\nsecond featured Synopsys 224G TX over optics performance with OpenLight\u2019s 200G\nper Lambda Photonic IC.\n\n## The Benefits and Challenges of PCIe Over Optics\n\nIt bears noting that this is not the PCI-SIG\u2019s first foray into this new\nterritory. Calls to draft a proposal for PCIe over optics surfaced almost a\ndecade ago, driven by demand for low-power use cases. However, the case for\ndevelopment was not strong enough back then (even though increased efficiency\ndoes stand to reduce the total cost of ownership for data center operators).\n\nNow, however, the promise of low latency that PCIe and Compute Express Link\n(CXL) offer together is compelling enough to warrant true progress. Reducing\nlatency is a challenge that has dogged the industry for years, as excess\nlatency threatens a system\u2019s throughput.\n\nPCIe over optics doesn\u2019t just represent a low-power option; it can also\nprovide a cache \u2014 a coherent way of splitting compute resources between\nprocessors and accelerators using an optical link. This breakthrough is likely\nto prove timely given the proliferation of large language models and requisite\ntraining systems, the growing need for unstructured data processing, and the\ncorresponding exponential increase in demand for compute power.\n\nA further advantage for data centers that the low-latency PCIe over optics\nsolution offers is the disaggregation of resources such as central processing\nunits (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs), freeing up access to memory\nthat is currently highly localized and often untapped.\n\nPCIe over optics is crucial in enabling connectivity between rack units and\nenabling them to function as a cluster. PCIe itself serves as a controller \u2014\nthe digital logic that interfaces with a piece of software. One challenge is\nensuring the shift to PCIe over optics does not upend the software stack\ncontrol process.\n\nA bigger challenge lies in managing the physical layer and the\ninteroperability of the electro-optical interface. This is where Synopsys,\ntogether with OpenLight, plays a pivotal role by providing an electrical IP\nsolution that can work in conjunction with a photonic one. Once a common\nstandard is set, any photonic die vendor will be in a position to assimilate\nPCIe.\n\nIn an age defined by the activities of supercomputers and hyperscalers as well\nas data centers, it is clear that PCIe over optics represents the future of\nsignaling. Its development and adoption depends on the enablement of a\nsupportive ecosystem, which Synopsys is energetically pursuing. Once it\nbecomes a reality, Synopsys complete IP solutions for PCIe, CXL and Ethernet\nwill be on hand to make your first-pass silicon success possible.\n\n  * Chip Design Insights\n  * Photonic\n  * Silicon IP\n\n## Continue Reading\n\n#### The Future of PCIe Is Optical: Synopsys and OpenLight Present First PCIe\n7.0 Data-Rate-Over-Optics Demo\n\nBy Priyank Shukla, Keivan Javadi Khasraghi\n\nApr 09, 2024 / 3 min read\n\nTags: Chip Design Insights, Photonic, Silicon IP\n\n#### Mentium Accelerates Tape-out of AI Accelerator Chip for Space\nApplications on Synopsys Cloud\n\nBy Anuj Pant\n\nApr 04, 2024 / 3 min read\n\nTags: Customer Spotlight, Cloud, Chip Design Insights, Optical\n\n#### With USB4 v2, Faster Speeds Is the Name of the Game\n\nBy Gervais Fong\n\nMar 14, 2024 / 4 min read\n\nTags: Chip Design Insights, Interface IP, Consumer, Silicon IP\n\n## Footer\n\n### Corporate\n\n  * About Us\n  * Careers\n  * ESG\n  * Inclusion & Diversity\n  * Investor Relations\n  * View our Office Locations\n  * Contact Us\n\n### Product Insights\n\n  * Design\n  * Manufacturing\n  * Silicon IP\n  * Verification\n\n### Trending Solutions\n\n  * AI & Machine Learning\n  * Automotive\n  * Cloud EDA\n  * HPC, Data Center\n  * Multi-Die Systems\n\n### Learn\n\n  * Blogs\n  * Press Releases\n  * Newsroom\n  * What is EDA?\n  * What is Application Security?\n\n### Legal\n\n  * Privacy\n  * Software Integrity Agreements\n  * Security\n\n### Follow\n\n### Follow\n\n\u00a92024 Synopsys, Inc.
