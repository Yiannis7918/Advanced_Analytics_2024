She got up\naround 5:30 a.m., did some YouTube yoga, made coffee, prepared avocado toast\nfor breakfast, packed some lunch, and got ready for work, all while partially\nlistening to NPR\u2019s Morning Edition on KCRW 89.9FM. Around 7:30 a.m., she began\nher commute to her downtown Los Angeles office, where she works as a financial\ninstitution\u2019s Chief Financial Officer (CFO).\n\nAfter a fairly typical workday, she headed to her mother\u2019s condo on Olympic\nBlvd around 4:30 p.m. They caught up and spent quality time together over\nhome-cooked dinner. Around 6:00 p.m., they set out for the Crypto.com Arena,\nwhich is a short walk from her mother\u2019s condo, to watch the basketball game\nbetween the visiting Golden State Warriors (the reigning NBA champions at the\ntime), and the Los Angeles Lakers. Tip-off time was shortly after 7:00 p.m.,\nso Kara and her mom had enough time to settle in before the game.\n\n> Contents Intro: Kara at the game\u2014February 23, 2023 An Unusually High Bill\n> Background: PurpleUrchin All Units Be Advised\u2014February 24, 2023 What the IT\n> Security Team Found Mitigation and Response Kara\u2019s Review Session (Lessons\n> Learned)\n\n##\n\nAn Unusually High Bill\n\nDuring halftime, Kara glanced at her phone and noticed a new email. It was\nfrom one of her direct reports\u2014a financial controller\u2014responsible for managing\ncompany expenses. The controller\u2019s email detailed an unusually high bill from\ntheir cloud service provider, requesting immediate attention to review the\nunexpected charges and determine the next steps. The timing was less than\nideal, adding a layer of urgency literally in the middle of an otherwise\nengaging basketball game. Kara sent a quick reply and set up a meeting with\nthe controller first thing the following day.\n\nThe basketball game ended around 9:30 p.m.\u2014the Lakers defeated the visiting\nWarriors 124-111. Kara and her mom eventually navigated their exit from the\npacked arena. They got back to her mom\u2019s condo, said their goodbyes, and Kara\nbegan the long drive back home to Glendale through some light rain, all while\nthinking about the email from her controller.\n\n## Keep reading with a 7-day free trial\n\nSubscribe to IntelEdge360 with Bidemi Ologunde to keep reading this post and\nget 7 days of free access to the full post archives.\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
