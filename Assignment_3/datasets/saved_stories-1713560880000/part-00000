Soon the governor pulled up in his\nSUV. Women danced, and an emcee raised his hands to the sky. When the crowd\ngathered around an enclosure holding the camels, one man said he was looking\nat \u201cthe future.\u201d\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nThe camels had arrived to replace the cows.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nSamburu County\u2019s governor says that the climate patterns have become\n\u201cabnormal.\u201d The reduction in rainfall is so obvious, he said, that anybody can\nsee it. \u201cYou don\u2019t need science machines here to measure that.\u201d\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nCows, here and across much of Africa, have been the most important animal for\neons \u2014 the foundation of economies, diets, traditions.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nBut now grazable land is shrinking. Water sources are drying up. A three-year\ndrought in the Horn of Africa that ended last year killed 80 percent of the\ncows in this part of Kenya and shattered the livelihoods of so many people.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nIn this region with the thinnest of margins, millions are being forced to\nadapt to climate change \u2014 including those who were now drawing numbers from a\nhat, each corresponding to one of the 77 camels that had just arrived in\nSamburu County.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\n\u201cYour number?\u201d a village chief, James Lelemusi, asked the first person to\ndraw.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nThe regional government had purchased the camels from traders near the border\nwith Somalia, at $600 per head. So far 4,000 camels, as part of that program,\nhave been distributed across the lowlands of the county, speeding up a shift\nthat had already been happening for decades across several other cattle-\ndependent parts of Africa. A handful of communities, particularly in Kenya and\nEthiopia, are in various stages of the transition, according to academic\nstudies.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nThe global camel population has doubled over the last 20 years, something the\nU.N. agency for agriculture and investment attributes partly to the animal\u2019s\nsuitability amid climate change. In times of hardship, camels produce more\nmilk than cows.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nMany cite an adage: The cow is the first animal to die in a drought; the camel\nis the last.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\n\u201cIf there was no climate change, we would not even bother to buy these\ncamels,\u201d said Jonathan Lati Lelelit, the governor of Samburu, a county about\n240 miles north of Nairobi. \u201cWe have so many other things to do with the\nlittle money we have.

They were also\nthose judged by local officials to be the most in need. They had stories of\nnear-total cattle losses, of walking miles to find water, of violent run-ins\nwith a neighboring tribe as they strayed farther from their territory in\nsearch of grazing space for their faltering livestock.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nStill, many said the plight of one person stood out: Dishon Leleina.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nLeleina, 42, had been wealthy by the standards of this region before the\ndrought. He had two wives and 10 kids, and had been surrounded by an abundance\nof cows for nearly as long as he could remember. He even sacrificed bulls \u2014\nwith a stab to the back of the head \u2014 on each of his wedding days.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nBut when one rainy season failed, then another, then another, his stock of 150\ncows plummeted over several years as never before. A few dozen were raided by\nthe bordering Pokot tribe. And more than a hundred withered away \u2014 going\nskinny in the midsection, swelling in other areas. Some would go to sleep at\nnight and never wake up. Some would arrive at last at a water source, drink\nlustily and collapse to their death. Several times, including after losing his\nbest milking cow, Leleina roared at the sky in fury. By the time the rains\nresumed last year, he had seven cows left.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\n\u201cI had one status\u201d before the drought, he said. \u201cAnd now I have another.\u201d\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nPeople walked for hours to attend the camel distribution, some putting on\ntheir best clothing.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nWhat hadn\u2019t changed was his daily routine; he moved in step with his\nlivestock, often walking miles per day. But now he had cut back to one meal\nper day \u2014 as did many other pastoralists. He lost weight. Several times, he\nfainted. Even on the day of the camel distribution, as the event stretched\ninto late afternoon, almost nobody was seen eating or drinking.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nAs the number drawing began, Leleina pressed into the crowd. An organizer with\na sheet of paper recorded who would take which camel home. Some of the camels\nwere big, some small, some muscular, many slender, and as soon as people\npulled numbers \u2014 73, 6, 27 \u2014 they darted off to find their animal in the\ncrowd.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nThen it was Leleina\u2019s turn. He reached into the hat.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\n\u201cNumber 17,\u201d he said.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nCamel recipients, including Leleina (center, in green), crowd around a\nchecklist keeping track of the animals and their new owners.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nHe walked toward the camels, scrap of paper in hand, and tried to use his\nwooden staff to poke a few of the animals, which were bunched together,\nobscuring the numbers painted at the base of their necks. Leleina squinted\ninto the sun. He went in another direction. He prodded a few more animals. And\nthen he found her: a skinny camel with a medium build, a rich tuft of longer\nfur on its hump.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nHe gave her a pat.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nIt would be dark soon, and Leleina still needed to guide his new camel home \u2014\nseveral miles through the powdery dirt and shrub land. But even in this harsh\nplace, Camel 17 could manage to find a snack.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nShe darted over to an acacia tree, pulling flowers into her mouth, working her\ntongue around two-inch thorns.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\n### An animal built for drought\n\nThe camel is sometimes described as an animal designed by committee, what with\nits hodgepodge of features \u2014\n\nCamel features\n\nthe thin legs of a whippet,\n\nthe rippled midsection\n\nof a horse,\n\nthe neck of a stunted giraffe.\n\nthe thin legs of a whippet,\n\nthe rippled midsection\n\nof a horse,\n\nthe neck of a stunted giraffe.\n\nthe thin legs of a whippet,\n\nthe rippled midsection of a horse,\n\nthe neck of a stunted giraffe.\n\nBut among mammals, the camel is almost singularly equipped to handle extremes.\n\nCamels can go two weeks without water, as opposed to a day or two for a cow.\nThey can lose 30 percent of their body weight and survive, one of the highest\nthresholds for any large animal. Their body temperatures fluctuate in sync\nwith daily climate patterns. When they pee, their urine trickles down their\nlegs, keeping them cool. When they lie down, their leathery knees fold into\npedestals that work to prop much of their undersides just above the ground,\nallowing cooling air to pass through.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nOne recently published paper, perhaps straying from science to reverence,\ncalled them a \u201cmiracle species.\u201d\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re unparalleled in terms of domestic animals.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Piers Simpkin, the Nairobi-based global livestock adviser for Mercy Corps\n\nMilk is one of the biggest nutrition sources for people in Samburu. With\ncamels, the hope is that people can still have milk during droughts.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nAnd yet in much of Africa \u2014 for much of human history \u2014 their attributes\nhaven\u2019t been needed. For centuries, they\u2019ve resided primarily in the driest\nouter ring of the continent, while cows \u2014 outnumbering camels in Africa 10 to\n1 \u2014 reigned in the lush river plains, in the highlands. Kenya, where the\nlandscape can turn from green to reddish and back in an hour\u2019s drive, has long\nbeen a middle ground: a place where some tribes use camels and more use cows,\nwith identities forming around that choice. Because of that, neighboring\ntribes see the consequences of using one animal vs. the other. That has\nseemingly transformed Samburu County \u2014 an area the size of New Jersey that is\nhome to the Samburu tribe \u2014 into an experiment on how livestock fare, and how\nhumans respond, in a warming climate.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nThe experiment started about a half-century ago, according to Louise Sperling,\na scholar who conducted fieldwork in Samburu in the 1980s. The Samburu were\namong the most \u201cspecialized and successful\u201d cattle-keepers in East Africa, she\nwrote in one account, but they were increasingly mixing with and marrying\nmembers of a nearby tribe, the Rendille \u2014 camel-keepers.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nOver the subsequent decades, they also noticed changes in traditional weather\npatterns. Fewer rainy seasons. Less predictability. And most importantly: more\nfrequent droughts.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nUptake was gradual. Cows still overwhelmingly outnumbered camels. And cows\nstill defined the Samburu identity, used in celebrations or as dowries.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nBut then came the longest series of failed rainy seasons on record in the Horn\nof Africa.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nThe drought started in 2020 and held its grip for three years. An\ninternational team of scientists said a drought of this severity had been 100\ntimes more likely because of climate change. In Samburu, the smell of rotting\ncattle carcasses spread across this county of roughly 310,000 people.\nMalnutrition spiked, including among children and the elderly. The Kenyan\ngovernment and the World Food Program had to step in with aid.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nAnd yet the level of need wasn\u2019t equal.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nNoompon Lenkamaldanyani, a single mother of four, lost 18 of her 20 cows and\nfell short on milk, but she noticed her camel-owning neighbors were willing to\nstep in and offer help.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nOne county official calls cows a cultural \u201ctreasure.\u201d But they are becoming\nrarer in the county\u2019s lowlands.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nLekojde Loidongo said he and his family \u201cdidn\u2019t suffer much,\u201d as all 22 of\ntheir camels continued to produce milk.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nEven Leleina, the new owner of Camel 17, said he noticed how the animals fared\ndifferently. He\u2019d owned three camels before the drought hit. They all\nsurvived.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nIf he had any regrets, it was that he hadn\u2019t moved earlier. His father, who\ndied in 2021, had been an early adopter of camels.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\n\u201cIn the future,\u201d Leleina said, echoing a conclusion shared by others, \u201cI\nforesee having more camels than cows.\u201d\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nBecause of these realizations, there has been very little backlash to the\ngovernment\u2019s camel program, which started eight years ago. Some are also\nobtaining their own camels by trading cattle at markets. Pastoralists \u2014 people\nwho move with their livestock herds \u2014 are often described as among the most\nvulnerable people in the world to climate change, and their fortunes can swing\nbased on the decisions they make about which animals to keep.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nA 2022 research paper published in Nature Food, analyzing a huge belt of land\nacross northern sub-Saharan Africa, noted increased heat stress and reduced\nwater availability in some areas and said milk production would benefit from a\nhigher proportion of camels, as well as goats, which are also more climate-\nresilient than cows. Camel milk is a comparable substitute for cow\u2019s milk. It\ntends to be lower in fat and higher in certain minerals, said Anne Mottet, the\nlead livestock specialist at the International Fund for Agricultural\nDevelopment. Many say it has a saltier taste.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nCamel vs cattle\n\nCow vs. camel milk production impacts\n\nFeed needed (kg)*\n\nWater needed (kg)*\n\nCO2 emissions (kg)*\n\n*for producing one metric ton of milk\n\nCows\n\nCamels\n\nCow vs. camel milk production impacts\n\nFeed needed (kg)*\n\nWater needed (kg)*\n\nCO2 emissions (kg)*\n\nCows\n\n*for producing one metric ton of milk\n\nCamels\n\nCow vs. camel milk production impacts\n\nFeed needed (kg)*\n\nWater needed (kg)*\n\nCO2 emissions (kg)*\n\nCows\n\nCamels\n\n*to produce one metric ton of milk\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just following the trends of the drought,\u201d said Lepason Lenanguram,\nanother camel recipient in Samburu. \u201cPeople want camels now. The culture is\nchanging.\u201d\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nThe Samburu governor said he believes \u201ctotally\u201d that shifting to the camel is\nthe right move. He noted that Samburu \u2014 with large swaths far removed from the\nelectrical grid and without running water \u2014 had contributed relatively little\nto global greenhouse gas emissions. By far the greatest source of emissions in\nrural areas like Samburu is methane, a byproduct of the cow\u2019s complex\ndigestive process. Camels emit far less methane.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nThe program gives away only one camel per person. But it can still build up\npeace of mind, said the director of the governor\u2019s press service, Jeff Lekupe,\nwho was on-site when the camels were distributed. With even one camel, a\nfamily has better chances of having milk during a drought. And then there is a\n\u201cripple effect,\u201d he said. The camel gives birth. The population grows.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\n\u201cSo that next time,\u201d he said, \u201cthe need for the WFP will be minimal.\u201d\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\n### Getting acclimated to Camel 17\n\nFor Leleina, Camel 17 \u2014 a female \u2014 symbolized the start of a rebuild, but it\ndidn\u2019t begin well. Arriving at her new home \u2014 a circular property, ringed by\nbranches and thorns, a mile from the closest unpaved road \u2014 the animal quickly\nstarted tussling with one of the three other camels. They bit one another.\nThey made noises. They locked necks, and they only stopped when Leleina roped\nthe legs of the other camel as a way to keep her from moving.\n\nThat night, Leleina put a mat on the floor outside his hut and felt too\nnervous to go to sleep. He\u2019d heard stories about other camels darting off \u2014\nsomething that almost never happened with a cow \u2014 or feeling uneasy in new\nsurroundings; a neighbor\u2019s camel had escaped and been mauled by a lion. So\nLeleina trained his eyes on Camel 17 for hour after hour as she brayed.\n\nEventually the sun rose. Camel 17 was still there.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nSamburu had to depend on food aid during the most recent drought. Officials\nhope that in the next drought that won\u2019t be necessary.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\n\u201cThe camel might have been thinking about where it came from,\u201d Leleina said.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nIn the morning, more at ease, he let the newest addition to his herd go off.\nShe needed to eat. The job of following her fell to Leleina\u2019s 9-year-old\ndaughter, and after the camel had been out for a while, Leleina decided to\njoin her. So he set off in the direction of a red-rock table mountain,\ncrunching through the scrub, occasionally coming upon bones, and moving closer\nto an area that he knew had foliage for camels and was free of predators. He\nheard nothing for five minutes, then 10, and then shouted his daughter\u2019s name.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\n\u201cNashenjo,\u201d he shouted.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nThen a minute later:\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\n\u201cNashenjo!\u201d\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nHe heard an animal noise.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\n\u201cThe camels are not far from here,\u201d he said.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nIn a circle of trees, he saw not only Camel 17, but a half-dozen other camels\n\u2014 craning their necks from branch to branch. A few of the camels were his.\nOthers belonged to a neighbor. It was a critical mass of camels in a place\nthat had once belonged almost entirely to cattle, and the ranks only figured\nto grow. A day earlier, at the same time of the distribution, a neighbor\u2019s\ncamel had gone into labor. Leleina\u2019s neighbors had crouched at the camel\u2019s\nside, pulling out the healthy baby by the legs.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\nLeleina sat down at the base of a tree and watched the animals eat. Camel 17\nwas still skinny, but that was understandable, he said. She needed time to\nrecover. Her trip to get here had been 100-odd miles, seven days, three stops\nfor water, and even in that journey he saw why she was suited for her new\nhome.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a survivor,\u201d he said.\n\n# How climate change is turning camels into the new cows\n\n##### About this story\n\nDesign, development and illustrations by Hailey Haymond.
