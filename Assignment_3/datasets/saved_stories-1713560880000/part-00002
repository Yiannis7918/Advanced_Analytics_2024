A dramatic\nrecent spike in the number of drugs that are unavailable has created serious\nproblems for doctors, pharmacists, the NHS and patients, it found.\n\nThe number of warnings drug companies have issued about impending supply\nproblems for certain products has more than doubled from 648 in 2020 to 1,634\nlast year.\n\nMark Dayan, the report\u2019s lead author and the Nuffield Trust\u2019s Brexit programme\nlead, said: \u201cThe rise in shortages of vital medicines from rare to commonplace\nhas been a shocking development that few would have expected a decade ago.\u201d\n\nThe UK has been struggling since last year with major shortages of drugs to\ntreat ADHD, type 2 diabetes and epilepsy. Three ADHD drugs that were in short\nsupply were meant to be back in normal circulation by the end of 2023 but\nremain hard to obtain.\n\nSome medicine shortages are so serious that they are imperilling the health\nand even lives of patients with serious illnesses, pharmacy bosses warned.\n\nHealth charities have seen a sharp rise in calls from patients unable to\nobtain their usual medication. Nicola Swanborough, head of external affairs at\nthe Epilepsy Society, said: \u201cOur helpline has been inundated with calls from\ndesperate people who are having to travel miles, often visiting multiple\npharmacies to try and access their medication.\u201d\n\nPaul Rees, the chief executive of the National Pharmacy Association, which\nrepresents most of the UK\u2019s 7,000 independently owned pharmacies, said:\n\u201cSupply shortages are a real and present danger to those patients who rely on\nlife-saving medicines for their wellbeing. Pharmacy teams have seen the\nproblems get worse in this country over recent years, putting more patients at\nrisk.\n\n\u201cPharmacists ... are spending hours a day hunting down stock, yet too often\nhave to turn patients away. It\u2019s distressing when pharmacy teams find\nthemselves unable to provide a prompt medicines services, through no fault of\ntheir own.\u201d\n\nGlobal manufacturing problems linked to Covid, inflation, the war in Ukraine\nand global instability have helped cause the UK\u2019s unprecedented inability to\nensure patients can access drugs.\n\nBut Britain\u2019s departure from the EU in 2020 has significantly aggravated the\nproblem, laid bare the \u201cfragility\u201d of the country\u2019s medicines supply networks\nand could lead to the situation worsening, the report said.\n\n\u201cA clear picture emerged of underlying fragilities at a global and UK level,\nnot fundamentally rooted in Brexit but exacerbated by it in some specific\nways, especially through some companies removing the UK from their supply\nchains,\u201d it said.\n\nThe UK\u2019s exit from the single market has disrupted the previously smooth\nsupply of drugs, for example through the creation of a requirement for customs\nchecks at the border, as has Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU\u2019s European\nMedicines Agency and start approving drugs itself. The UK is now much slower\nthan the EU at making new drugs available, the report found.\n\nPost-Brexit red tape has prompted some firms to stop supplying to the UK\naltogether.\n\nThe fact that the fall in sterling\u2019s value after the Brexit vote in 2016\ncoincided with drugs being in much shorter supply globally due to\npharmaceutical firms experiencing shortages of ingredients, which drove up\nprices, has also played a key role in creating the shortages.\n\nThat has forced the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) to agree to\npay above the usual price for drugs that are scarce to try to ensure\ncontinuity of supply far more often than it used to. \u201cPrice concessions\u201d rose\ntenfold from about 20 a month before 2016 to 199 a month in late 2022, and\ncost the NHS in England \u00a3220m in 2022-23, the thinktank found.\n\nThe report is based on Freedom of Information requests to health bodies as\nwell as interviews and a roundtable discussion with key figures in the drugs\nindustry, senior DHSC civil servants and European health bodies.\n\nIt warned that Brexit had created \u201cfurther risks ... for the UK\u201d. The Nuffield\nTrust said drug shortages could get worse because the EU\u2019s 27 countries have\nrecently decided to act as a unified bloc to try to minimise the impact of\nglobal scarcity, which could leave supplying Britain even less of a priority\nfor drug companies.\n\nDr Andrew Hill, an expert in the drugs industry at Liverpool University, said:\n\u201cWith this background stress on global supplies, the UK is now more vulnerable\nto drug shortages. The UK is now stuck behind the US and Europe in the queue\nfor essential drugs. Other countries offer high prices and easier access, with\nsimpler regulations for supply.\u201d\n\nMinisters should agree to pay more for generic medicines, which are usually\nmuch cheaper than branded ones, to help tackle shortages, Hill added.\n\nThe Royal Pharmaceutical Society, which represents pharmacists, urged\nministers to amend the law to allow community pharmacists to circumvent\nshortages by giving patients slightly different prescriptions, as their\ncounterparts in hospitals already do.\n\n\u201cAt present, if a liquid version of a medicine is available but tablets have\nbeen prescribed and are out of stock, the pharmacist cannot provide the liquid\nversion,\u201d said James Davies, the society\u2019s director for England. \u201cThe patient\nhas no choice but to return to the prescriber for a new prescription, which\ncauses unnecessary workload for GPs and delay for the patient.\u201d\n\nDHSC said most drugs remained available. \u201cConcessionary prices can arise for\nvarious reasons and cannot be linked to shortages,\u201d a DHSC spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cOur priority is to ensure patients continue to get the treatments they need.\nThere are around 14,000 licensed medicines and the overwhelming majority are\nin good supply.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Drugs\n  * Brexit\n  * European Union\n  * NHS\n  * Health\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### Brexit plans in \u2018complete disarray\u2019 as EU import checks delayed, say businesses\n\n1h ago\n\n  * ### UK to delay start of health and safety checks on EU imports \u2013 report\n\n19h ago\n\n  * ### Brussels proposes return to pre-Brexit mobility for UK and EU young people\n\n22h ago\n\n  * ### Labour aiming to draw closer to Europe on foreign and security issues\n\n2d ago\n\n  * ### Garden centres in UK stockpile plants before new Brexit checks\n\n2d ago\n\n  * ### Even Europe\u2019s far-right firebrands seem to sense Brexit is a disaster\n\n5d ago\n\n  * ### \u2018It\u2019s catastrophic\u2019: Italian restaurants in London struggle to find staff post-Brexit\n\n5d ago\n\n  * ### New Brexit checks will cause food shortages in UK, importers warn\n\n6d ago\n\n  * ### UK and EU \u2018within kissing distance\u2019 of post-Brexit Gibraltar border deal\n\n7d ago\n\n  * ### Briton and French wife face \u00a311,000 Brexit visa bill to return home to UK\n\n10 Apr 2024\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * UK\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Ukraine\n  * Environment\n  * Science\n  * Global development\n  * Football\n  * Tech\n  * Business\n  * Obituaries\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
