Poudre Libraries\n\nOn February 13, 1919, a reader in Colorado checked out Ivanhoe, Walter Scott\u2019s\nhistorical romance novel, from the Fort Collins Public Library and Free\nReading Room.\n\nA few months ago, the book was finally returned to the library\u2014now named the\nPoudre River Public Library District\u2014105 years after its due date.\n\n\u201cIt came to us from an unnamed woman who [got it from] from her brother, who\nfound it in their mom\u2019s belongings in Kansas,\u201d Annaclaire Crumpton, the\nlibrary\u2019s digital communications specialist, tells Jennifer Meckles of the\nlocal TV station KUSA.\n\nThe book\u2019s inside back cover holds the original due date slip, which shows\nthat it was checked out just three times before its disappearance. The inside\nfront cover features a slip displaying its accession number, which was\nassigned to the book when the library acquired it, and the library\u2019s lending\nrules.\n\nAccording to the rules, \u201cA fine of two cents per day shall be collected on all\nbooks. If a messenger be sent for a detained book an additional charge of 25\ncents shall be collected.\u201d\n\nUnder this system, the fine would now be approximately $760, or about $14,000\nwhen adjusted for inflation, writes Katie Auman, the library\u2019s communications\nand development director, for the Poudre Libraries blog.\n\nThe inside front cover of the overdue Ivanhoe Poudre Libraries\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been annotated and well-loved\u2014so you wonder how many generations it went\nthrough, how many parents to kids,\u201d Crumpton tells KUSA.\n\nLuckily for the unknown reader who checked out the book, the library stopped\nenforcing overdue materials fines in November 2020.\n\nIvanhoe was not the first decades-overdue book recovered by the Colorado\nlibrary. In 2019, a book was returned in the mail 40 years after its due date.\nThe text, Working With Stained Glass by Jean Jacques Duval, had been checked\nout in October 1978. Although it was returned before the termination of\noverdue fines, the library dismissed the charges, which, when calculated at\nthe 2019 rate of $0.10 per day, totaled almost $1,500.\n\nFort Collins\u2019 library system has a rich history dating back to 1882, when\ncitizens established a community reading room. In 1900, it became Colorado\u2019s\nsixth public library.\n\nWCVB\u2019s Jocelyn Brumbaugh reports that the library\u2019s staff hopes the overdue\nIvanhoe can be displayed at a local history museum or in a special space at\nthe library.\n\nIn other parts of the country\u2014and the world\u2014libraries have received books that\nhad been missing for even longer periods. Just last year, a university\nreceived a donation that included a copy of James Clerk Maxwell\u2019s An\nElementary Treatise on Electricity that was nearly 120 years overdue at a\nlibrary in Massachusetts.\n\nMeanwhile, the record for the world\u2019s most overdue library book belongs to an\nobscure German text borrowed from the University of Cambridge\u2019s Sidney Sussex\nCollege around 1667 or 1668. A professor stumbled across the volume and\nreturned in 1956, nearly 300 years after it went missing.\n\nGet the latest stories in your inbox every weekday.\n\nAaron Boorstein | READ MORE\n\nAaron Boorstein is an intern with Smithsonian magazine.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  1.
