I\u2019d like to think that I\u2019m resilient and well adjusted, having\ngone through medical school and rigorous surgical training. I\u2019ve been a doctor\nfor 13 years and much of that period has been spent training to be as good a\nsurgeon as I could ever be. I have great family support, a physician wife who\nunderstands my work and I\u2019ve never been diagnosed with a mental illness.\n\nThe suicide death of Dr Andrew Bryant, a Brisbane gastroenterologist last week\nhit a raw nerve. His wife wrote this honest and courageous letter.\n\nAlthough I\u2019ve never had serious suicidal thoughts, I \u2013 like many other doctors\n\u2013 have been through many dark seasons. Depression, anxiety, burnout,\nsuicidality, hopelessness, lethargy, anhedonia, feeling flat, worry, and the\nlike are all different flavours of the same phenomena: the negative human\nresponse to internal or external stressors. Of course, the causes are always\nmultifactorial. It cannot and should not be oversimplified to family history,\ngenetics, behavioural deficiencies, bad environment or poor social support.\n\nWhen I carefully dissect my dark seasons, some common themes often emerge.\nWork is often the critical exacerbating and perpetuating factor in those dark\ntimes. Because as a surgeon I spend the vast majority of my lifetime at work,\nwhat happens there influences all other aspects of my life including my\nmarriage, family and social life.\n\nHere are 3 common things that have thrown me into some dark pit of despair:\n\n####\n\n1\\. Loss of Control\n\nI have lost control of my days. I had worked in a hospital where I was oncall\n24/7, 12 days out of 14. I had fortnightly weekends off. When I was preparing\nfor surgical exams, I\u2019d be working and studying from 6.30am to 10pm everyday,\nseeing my family only on the weekends for lunch. I had worked in a hospital\nnetwork that covered 4 campuses and drove 500kms a week when covering these\nsites. I had worked in a hospital where I didn\u2019t get home for days at a time,\nsleeping overnight in hospital quarters, outpatient clinic benches and in my\ncar. I used to have my sleeping bag, toiletries and change in the boot of my\ncar because I didn\u2019t know if I was going to make it home some nights. Plans\nchange every single day at work because of emergencies. I can\u2019t even be sure\nwhat the next hour will bring when I am on call. You might ask, why can\u2019t you\nwork less? It\u2019s not as easy as that. If I decide to work less, who is going to\ncover the hospital? If the hospital aren\u2019t employing other doctors, we can\u2019t\nallow patients to go uncovered. I accept the fact that I have a duty of care\nto be on call. The intensity and personal damage of these on call periods are\noften forgotten.\n\nNot only that, we are losing control of health care in general. Everyday,\nthere\u2019s a new form, a new guideline, a new protocol, a new health software, a\nnew policy all dictating, restricting and modifying clinician activities. Some\nof these policies are written by people who do not see patients. There\u2019s a\nwhole paid industry dedicated to restructuring what doctors and nurses do to\nreduce costs and increase output.\n\n####\n\n2\\. Loss of Support.\n\nJust imagine. I start my days at 6am. I wake up to an email alerting me of the\nnumber of discharge summaries that haven\u2019t been completed and the various\ncomputer based modules I have to complete (hand washing, privacy, lifting\npatients, etc). Round starts at 7am. I see 15-20 patients with various travel\nforms, certificates, scripts that need completing. All to be done via the\nelectronic health system, clunky, not user friendly, takes a long time to log\nin. Then I start an overbooked operating list at 8am. There are 7 cases\nbooked. I have no say on who gets on the operating list and the order of\npatients. The first patient haven\u2019t been checked in. The diabetic one is\nhypoglycaemic. The infant is cranky. The autistic child is running away. The\ninterpreter is not here yet. The computer is still not logging in. The\npassword is expired. I used to be able to arrange the operating list because I\nknow that some operations take longer than others. But now, the bookings\noffice determine that that all my tonsillectomies take 14 minutes because\nthat\u2019s the average time recorded on the computer. The moment I scrub in, the\ntimer starts. The moment I unscrub timer stops. Click. Click. Click. Because\nthe theatre bookings does not take into account the interpreter time, pre-med\nperiod or transfer to ICU, the list is running late. The nurse in charge is\nbreathing down my neck to finish on time. I still took about 14 minutes on\neach case, but the team is delayed by external clinical reasons. The theatre\nteam is anxious to finish, everything is rushed, and mistakes are bound to\noccur.\n\nIn the mean time, I field 12 phone calls from ED, GP and other units. By now\nthere are 3 patients waiting for me in ED and 1 being flown in from another\nhospital. The operating list is finished late. I rushed to ED, and gulped down\na cup of instant coffee. Then I arrive late to the afternoon clinic, which\nagain is overbooked. Clinic nurses are not happy. I see 8-10 patients while\ntaking more calls. I try to discuss complex surgeries with patients but I keep\ngetting interrupted by calls and paperwork. Then I run back to theatre for an\nemergency case. By this time I\u2019m set up for failure. I\u2019m tired, cranky and my\nhead is full of jobs to do. I do the afternoon round, see more consults, admit\nmore patients and dictate letters. I have taken up to 70 calls on a 24h on\ncall period. By 6pm I\u2019m totally exhausted. I grab a packet of chips, ginger\nbeer, and start working on the papers I was meant to write up. I review the\ncase notes for the next couple of days. I get home between 7-8pm. Grab dinner\nand put the kids to bed. I get called back in and I take a patient to theatre\nfor an emergency procedure. I come back just after midnight and sleep. I get\ncalled four more times between midnight and 6am.\n\n6am. Repeat.\n\nI have lost control of my days and I have lost support. When can I actually\nfind support? I don\u2019t have time to talk to my colleagues about life. I don\u2019t\nhave time with my family. I don\u2019t have time to catch up with friends. Social\nties are lost when one stepped into medical school. I\u2019ve lost count of the\nnumber of significant life events I have missed (birthdays, anniversaries,\nreunions, school recitals, first walks, etc.)\n\nI delivered my third child with my own hands because the obstetrician was\nstuck in a traffic jam. The following morning I went to work because if I\ndidn\u2019t 12 patients have to miss their surgeries, 2 anaesthetists and about 8\nnurses will miss out on their day\u2019s income. More importantly, admin would not\nbe happy because a cancelled operating list is a huge financial loss to the\nhospital.\n\nI know where I can get support, but practically, when and how am I going to\nget that support?\n\nIn addition, doctors who scream for help may be formally reported, therefore\nhaving restrictions placed on their practice and then incurring higher medical\nindemnity fees in some situations. Trainees who ask for help may be labelled\nas underperforming and have to be commenced on probation or remediation. We\nmay not have practical access to the support that are often advertised.\n\n####\n\n3\\. Loss of Meaning\n\nInterestingly, the above physical and emotional stressors are reasonably\nmanageable to me. I\u2019m understanding my own physical and emotional limits.\nThese stressors induce exhaustion, but the excitement of the work and the\nintellectual challenge of the job bring a lot of personal satisfaction. I do\nget emotionally shaken at times because I deal with dying cancer patients,\nemergency airway disasters and sick complex children, but I get by.\n\nI am realising more and more that what brings me greatest distress is the\nrelentless administrative pressure which take away the meaningful clinical\nengagement I have with my patients. And I wonder if this is what many young\ndoctors are experiencing as well. Medicine used to be a meaningful pursuit.\nNow it has become a tiresome industry. The joy, purpose and meaning of\nmedicine has been codified, sterilised, protocolised, industrialised and\nregimented. Doctors are caught in a web of business, no longer a noble\nvocation. The altruism of young doctors have been replaced by the shackles of\nefficiency, productivity and key performance indicators.\n\nI have little say in organising my very own operating lists or clinics. Even\nthe power to re-order the operating list has been taken from the surgeon. The\nthing that I love doing (operating & seeing patients) is being measured,\nrecorded and benchmarked. The clinics are overbooked to get numbers through.\nThe paperwork for each patient encounter is increasing with each passing year.\nThere are so many other non-clinical departments dictating what I should do\nand how best to do it. The mantra is \u201ccost-effectiveness and increased\nproductivity.\u201d\n\nI went into medicine knowing that I will have to sacrifice much for the sake\nof my patients. What I am realising is that today in modern medicine, a doctor\nis just one of the many commodities in this complex industry. It\u2019s no longer\nabout the patient. It\u2019s about the business of hospitals. Patient satisfaction\nofficers, Theatre Utilisation officers, Patient Flow Coordinators. These are\nall business roles.\n\nAs a surgeon I spent a year in a hospital where I smiled on the way to work\nand I am so grateful for my job. I looked forward to long days because I knew\nwhat I was doing was significant. Another year in another hospital, I dreaded\ngoing to work. I hated being on call. I was burned out and I couldn\u2019t control\nmy emotions at work and at home. I\u2019m not inherently an offensive or rude\nperson, I\u2019m just a person pushed to the limits and set to fail because of the\ncircumstances around my work. Same surgeon, different jobs. The forces that\npushed me to losing control of my emotions are likely the same forces that\nmight push some of us to suicide.\n\nTo some hospitals and their business, I\u2019m not a Surgeon. I\u2019m just an employee.\nOverworked, burned out, replaceable. The noble call to Medicine has been\nsuffocated by the bureaucratic force exerting itself as the medical industry.\n\nWould you agree or disagree with my thoughts?
