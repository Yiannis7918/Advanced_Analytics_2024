The company hopes it\nwill support future artificial intelligence (AI) research.\n\nThe machine, dubbed \"Hala Point,\" can perform AI workloads 50 times faster and\nuse 100 times less energy than conventional computing systems that use central\nprocessing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs), Intel\nrepresentatives said in a statement. These figures are based on findings\nuploaded March 18 to the preprint server IEEE Explore, which have not been\npeer-reviewed.\n\nHala Point will initially be deployed at Sandia National Laboratories in New\nMexico, where scientists will use it to tackle problems in device physics,\ncomputing architecture and computer science.\n\nRelated: China develops new light-based chiplet that could power artificial\ngeneral intelligence \u2014 where AI is smarter than humans\n\nPowered by 1,152 of Intel's new Loihi 2 processors \u2014 a neuromorphic research\nchip \u2014 this large-scale system comprises 1.15 billion artificial neurons and\n128 billion artificial synapses distributed over 140,544 processing cores.\n\nIt can make 20 quadrillion operations per second \u2014 or 20 petaops. Neuromorphic\ncomputers process data differently from supercomputers, so it's hard to\ncompare them. But Trinity, the 38th most powerful supercomputer in the world\nboasts approximately 20 petaFLOPS of power \u2014 where a FLOP is a floating-point\noperation per second. The world's most powerful supercomputer is Frontier,\nwhich boasts a performance of 1.2 exaFLOPS, or 1,194 petaFLOPS.\n\n## How neuromorphic computing works\n\nNeuromorphic computing differs from conventional computing because of its\narchitecture, Prasanna Date, a computer scientist with the Oak Ridge National\nLaboratory (ORNL), wrote on ResearchGate. These types of computers use neural\nnetworks to build the machine.\n\n## Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now\n\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nIn classical computing, binary bits of 1s and 0s flow into hardware like the\nCPU, GPU or memory before processing calculations in sequence and spitting out\na binary output.\n\n(Image credit: Walden Kirsch/Intel Corporation)\n\nIn neuromorphic computing, however, a \"spike input\" \u2014 a set of discrete\nelectrical signals \u2014 is fed into the spiking neural networks (SNNs),\nrepresented by the processors. Where software-based neural networks are a\ncollection of machine learning algorithms arranged to mimic the human brain,\nSNNs are a physical embodiment of how that information is transmitted. It\nallows for parallel processing and spike outputs are measured following\ncalculations.\n\nLike the brain, Hala Point and the Loihi 2 processors use these SNNs, where\ndifferent nodes are connected and information is processed at different\nlayers, similar to neurons in the brain. The chips also integrate memory and\ncomputing power in one place. In conventional computers, processing power and\nmemory are separated; this creates a bottleneck as data must physically travel\nbetween these components. Both of these enable parallel processing and reduce\npower consumption.\n\n## Why neuromorphic computing could be an AI game-changer\n\nEarly results also show that Hala Point achieved a high energy efficiency\nreading for AI workloads of 15 trillion operations per watt (TOPS/W). Most\nconventional neural processing units (NPUs) and other AI systems achieve well\nunder 10 TOPS/W.\n\nNeuromorphic computing is still a developing field, with few other machines\nlike Hala Point in deployment, if any. Researchers with the International\nCentre for Neuromorphic Systems (ICNS) at Western Sydney University in\nAustralia, however, announced plans to deploy a similar machine in December\n2023.\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\n\u2014New brain-like transistor goes 'beyond machine learning'\n\n\u2014New DNA-infused computer chip can perform calculations and make future AI\nmodels far more efficient\n\n\u2014World's largest computer chip WSE-3 will power massive AI supercomputer 8\ntimes faster than the current record-holder\n\nTheir computer, called \"DeepSouth,\" emulates large networks of spiking neurons\nat 228 trillion synaptic operations per second, the ICNS researchers said in\nthe statement, which they said was equivalent to the rate of operations of the\nhuman brain.\n\nHala Point meanwhile is a \"starting point,\" a research prototype that will\neventually feed into future systems that could be deployed commercially,\naccording to Intel representatives.\n\nThese future neuromorphic computers might even lead to large language models\n(LLMs) like ChatGPT learning continuously from new data, which would reduce\nthe massive training burden inherent in current AI deployments.\n\nKeumars Afifi-Sabet\n\nChannel Editor, Technology\n\nKeumars is the technology editor at Live Science.
