I had, however, clarity\non what I wanted, and I hustled hard!\n\nNothing illegal, don't worry. But I was relentless and determined to push\nboundaries to create opportunities.\n\nI got my first job when I was seventeen. I moved 500 kilometers away from my\nhometown and anything familiar. I moved to Paris. Well, it wasn't really\nParis; it was the inner city, which was, in many ways, an even bigger\ndisruption than where I came from.\n\nA few weeks earlier, I had seen an ad for a company in a Linux magazine and\nthought it would be cool to work there.\n\nAgain, I had no prior experience, and it's worth emphasizing that I was\nseventeen. 17, for crying out loud! I would not have hired myself, and I was\naware of that.\n\nBut I emailed them to ask for a job. I took a long shot to get what I wanted.\n\nThey didn't reply. So, I searched for the owner's name and tracked him down. I\nwould call 2, 3, or 4 times a day for a few days until he picked up the phone\nand agreed to interview me.\n\nI got a job working for this company.\n\nIt was a long shot, but it paid off.\n\nA few years later, a friend told me about a business program he was in. It\nsounded super interesting. I thought I would enroll to plug the holes in my\nunderstanding of business.\n\nI applied and got rejected. I didn't qualify for the program because I didn't\nhave enough work experience and the required prior education.\n\nI accepted the rejection and went back to my regular job...\n\nJust kidding. I decided to take a long, long shot.\n\nI looked up their upcoming events. They had a public presentation of the\nbusiness program I was interested in soon. The man in charge of the program\nwould be presenting.\n\nI dressed up in a suit and tie and went to the business school for the\nmeeting. As soon as the man in charge of the program left the stage, I ran to\nhim and introduced myself.\n\n> \"Hello. My name is Greg. I'm a young entrepreneur, and I'm interested in\n> this program.\"\n\n> \"Great! You should apply. We like entrepreneurs.\"\n\n> \"I did, but I was told I don't qualify.\"\n\nHe pulled up his phone and called the woman in charge of the admissions.\n\nNext thing you know, my application was back on the evaluation pile. I became\nthe youngest person to graduate from this business program.\n\nAs we get older, it's natural to become more risk-averse because rejection\nsucks. So, we take fewer and fewer, smaller and smaller shots. We get\nreasonable.\n\nWe don't create these luck-forcing actions that can propel us 100 steps\nforward.\n\nWe subconsciously think our experience and skills should spare us from having\nto take these scary moves.\n\nThat's a mistake.\n\nWe should deliberately seek and take a few long shots every year. These kinds\nof shots have a 3 out of 10 or less chance of succeeding, but if they do, they\nwill make our lives better, more fun, or more interesting.\n\nSkills and experience should not just shield us from taking shots\u2014they should\nempower us to take even greater ones.\n\nGreg Gilbert's notes \u00a9 2024\n\n", "frontpage": false}
