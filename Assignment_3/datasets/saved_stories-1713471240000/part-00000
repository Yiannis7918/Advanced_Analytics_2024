The\nfine-tuned versions, called Llama 3, are optimized for dialogue use cases.\nLlama 3 models perform well on the benchmarks we tested, and in our human\nevaluations for helpfulness and safety, are on par with popular closed-source\nmodels.\n\nThis offer enables access to Llama-3-8B inference APIs and hosted fine-tuning\nin Azure AI Studio. Azure AI Studio is the perfect platform for building\nGenerative AI apps. AI Studio comes with features like playground to explore\nmodels and Prompt Flow to for prompt engineering and RAG (Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration) to integrate your data in your apps.\n\nThe inference APIs are billed on a pay-as-you-go basis for the input and\noutput tokens when scoring with the model. The fine-tuning jobs for models\nthat support fine-tuning are charged by the hour and inference for fine-tuned\nmodels is also billed by the tokens used plus an hourly hosting fee.\n\nThis offer is integrated with Azure AI Studio. You will be asked to navigate\nto Azure AI Studio to subscribe to this offer and use the models.\n\n###### Learn more\n\nResponsible Use Guide\n\nhttps://store-\nimages.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1072.683e5060-78e0-4023-be1b-8831550ccc99.8961ab3f-3e18-49f6-8812-41c668586e44.3602211b-579d-4b83-9b0c-b3ef46fe2563\n\nhttps://store-\nimages.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1072.683e5060-78e0-4023-be1b-8831550ccc99.8961ab3f-3e18-49f6-8812-41c668586e44.3602211b-579d-4b83-9b0c-b3ef46fe2563\n\nEnglish (United States) Your Privacy Choices Consumer Health Privacy\n\n", "frontpage": false}
