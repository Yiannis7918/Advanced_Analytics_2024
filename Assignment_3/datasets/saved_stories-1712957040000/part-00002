But in\nspace, the Sun can do more than provide electrical energy; it also emits an\nunending stream of solar wind.\n\nSolar sails can harness that wind and provide propulsion for spacecraft. NASA\nis about to test a new solar sail design that can make solar sails even more\neffective.\n\nSolar pressure pervades the entire Solar System. It weakens with distance, but\nit\u2019s present. It affects all spacecraft, including satellites. It affects\nlonger-duration spaceflights dramatically. A spacecraft on a mission to Mars\ncan be forced off course by thousands of kilometres during its voyage by solar\npressure. The pressure also affects a spacecraft\u2019s orientation, and they\u2019re\ndesigned to deal with it.\n\nThough it\u2019s a hindrance, solar pressure can be used to our advantage.\n\nA few solar sail spacecraft have been launched and tested, beginning with\nJapan\u2019s Ikaros spacecraft in 2010. Ikaros proved that radiation pressure from\nthe Sun in the form of photons can be used to control a spacecraft. The most\nrecent solar sail spacecraft is the Planetary Society\u2019s LightSail 2, launched\nin 2019. LightSail 2 was a successful mission that lasted over three years.\n\nThe Red Sea and the Nile River, from the LightSail 2 spacecraft.

Their\npropulsion systems are extremely lightweight and never run out of fuel. Solar\nsail spacecraft can perform missions more cheaply than other spacecraft and\ncan last longer, though they have limitations.\n\nThe solar sail concept is now proven to work, but the technology needs to\nadvance for it to be truly effective. A critical part of a solar sail\nspacecraft is its booms. Booms support the sail material; the lighter and\nstronger they are, the more effective the spacecraft will be. Though solar\nsails are much lighter than other spacecraft, the weight of the booms is still\na hindrance.\n\n> \u201cBooms have tended to be either heavy and metallic or made of lightweight\n> composite with a bulky design \u2013 neither of which work well for today\u2019s small\n> spacecraft.\u201d\n>\n> Keats Wilkie, ACS3 principal investigator, NASA\n\nNASA is about to launch a new solar sail design with a better support\nstructure. Called the Advanced Composite Solar Sail System (ACS3), it\u2019s\nstiffer and lighter than previous boom designs. It\u2019s made of carbon fibre and\nflexible polymers.\n\nThough solar sails have many advantages, they also have a critical drawback.\nThey\u2019re launched as small packages that must be unfurled before they start\nworking. This operation can be fraught with difficulties and induces stress in\nthe poor ground crew, who have to wait and watch to see if it\u2019s successful.\n\nThis image shows the ACS3 being unfurled at NASA\u2019s Langley Research Center.\nThe solar wind is reliable but not very powerful. It requires a large sail\narea to power a spacecraft effectively. The ACS2 is about 9 meters (30 ft) per\nside, requiring a strong, lightweight boom system. Image Credit: NASA\n\nACS3 will launch with a twelve-unit (12U) CubeSat built by NanoAvionics. The\nprimary goal is to demonstrate boom deployment, but the ACS3 team also hopes\nthe mission will prove that their solar sail spacecraft works.\n\nTo change direction, the spacecraft angles its sails. If boom deployment is\nsuccessful, the ACS3 team hopes to perform some maneuvers with the spacecraft,\nangling the sails and changing the spacecraft\u2019s orbit. The goal is to build\nlarger sails that can generate more thrust.\n\n> \u201cThe hope is that the new technologies verified on this spacecraft will\n> inspire others to use them in ways we haven\u2019t even considered.\u201d\n>\n> Alan Rhodes, ACS3 lead systems engineer, NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center\n\nThe ACS3 boom design is made to overcome a problem with booms: they\u2019re either\nheavy and slim or light and bulky.\n\n\u201cBooms have tended to be either heavy and metallic or made of lightweight\ncomposite with a bulky design \u2013 neither of which work well for today\u2019s small\nspacecraft,\u201d said NASA\u2019s Keats Wilkie. Wilke is the ACS3 principal\ninvestigator at Langley Research Center. \u201cSolar sails need very large, stable,\nand lightweight booms that can fold down compactly. This sail\u2019s booms are\ntube-shaped and can be squashed flat and rolled like a tape measure into a\nsmall package while offering all the advantages of composite materials, like\nless bending and flexing during temperature changes.\u201d\n\nACS3 will launch from Rocket Lab\u2019s launch complex 1 on New Zealand\u2019s north\nisland. Image Credit: Rocket Lab\n\nACS3 will be launched on an Electron rocket from Rocket Lab\u2019s launch complex\nin New Zealand. It\u2019ll head for a Sun-synchronous orbit 1,000 km (600 miles)\nabove Earth. Once it arrives, the spacecraft will unroll its booms and deploy\nits sail. It\u2019ll take about 25 minutes to deploy the sail, with a photon-\ngathering area of 80 square meters, or about 860 square feet. That\u2019s much\nlarger than Light Sail 2, which had a sail area of 32 square meters or about\n340 square feet.\n\nAs it deploys itself, cameras on the spacecraft will watch and monitor the\nshape and symmetry. The data from the maneuvers will feed into future sail\ndesigns.\n\n\u201cSeven meters of the deployable booms can roll up into a shape that fits in\nyour hand,\u201d said Alan Rhodes, the mission\u2019s lead systems engineer at NASA\u2019s\nAmes Research Center. \u201cThe hope is that the new technologies verified on this\nspacecraft will inspire others to use them in ways we haven\u2019t even\nconsidered.\u201d\n\nACS3 is part of NASA\u2019s Small Spacecraft Technology program. The program aims\nto deploy small missions that demonstrate unique capabilities rapidly. With\nunique composite and carbon fibre booms, the ACS3 system has the potential to\nsupport sails as large as 2,000 square meters, or about 21,500 square feet.\nThat\u2019s about half the area of a soccer field. (Or, as our UK friends\nmistakenly call it, a football field.)\n\nWith large sails, the types of missions they can power change. While solar\nsails have been small demonstration models so far, the system can potentially\npower some serious scientific missions.\n\n\u201cThe Sun will continue burning for billions of years, so we have a limitless\nsource of propulsion. Instead of launching massive fuel tanks for future\nmissions, we can launch larger sails that use \u201cfuel\u201d already available,\u201d said\nRhodes. \u201cWe will demonstrate a system that uses this abundant resource to take\nthose next giant steps in exploration and science.\u201d\n\nA solar flare as it appears in extreme ultraviolet light. The Sun is a free\nsource of energy that\u2019s not going away anytime soon, yet it\u2019s also hazardous.\nCredit: NASA/SFC/SDO\n\nSolar sail spacecraft don\u2019t have the instantaneous thrust that chemical or\nelectrical propulsion systems do. But the thrust is constant and never really\nwavers. They can do things other spacecraft struggle to do, such as taking up\nunique positions that allow them to study the Sun. They can serve as early\nwarning systems for coronal mass ejections and solar storms, which pose\nhazards.\n\nThe new composite booms also have other applications. Since they\u2019re so\nlightweight, strong, and compact, they could serve as the structural framework\nfor lunar and Mars habitats. They could also be used to support other\nstructures, like communication systems. If the system works, who knows what\nother applications it may serve?\n\n\u201cThis technology sparks the imagination, reimagining the whole idea of sailing\nand applying it to space travel,\u201d said Rudy Aquilina, project manager of the\nsolar sail mission at NASA Ames. \u201cDemonstrating the abilities of solar sails\nand lightweight, composite booms is the next step in using this technology to\ninspire future missions.\u201d\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nCategoriesSolar System, Space Exploration Technologies, Space FlightTagsACS3,\nAdvanced Composite Solar Sail System, Ikari, light sail, NASA, Rocket Lab,\nSmall Spacecraft Technology, solar sails\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
