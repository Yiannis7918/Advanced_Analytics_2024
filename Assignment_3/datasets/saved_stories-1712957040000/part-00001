In an interview, she discusses the revolution\nspawned by the drugs.\n\nInterview conducted by Martin U. M\u00fcller und Alexander Preker in Copenhagen\n\n04.01.2024, 14.55 Uhr\n\n  * X.com\n  * Facebook\n  * E-Mail\n  * Messenger\n  * WhatsApp\n\n  * E-Mail\n  * Messenger\n  * WhatsApp\n\nA home in the upmarket town of Gentofte, north of Copenhagen. A heart-shaped\nwreath on the front door, with a crackling fireplace behind it. The family of\nHans Christian Hagedorn, the founder of the Nordisk company known for its\ninsulin, once lived here. After decades of competition, the Danish company\nmerged with its much larger competitor Novo, and the corporation today bears\nboth names. Novo Nordisk bought back the old building to use for conferences\nand meetings. Lotte Bjerre Knudsen is wearing a knitted sweater under her down\njacket and has traveled to the interview by commuter train.\n\nAs unpretentious as the scientist appears, her discovery was revolutionary.\nHer research laid the foundation that led to the development of the weight\nloss drug Wegovy, which has changed the world. The medication causes the\npancreas to release more insulin, which helps against diabetes and \u2013 because\npeople taking the medication feel full more quickly \u2013 also against obesity.\nU.S. supermarkets claim they have been selling slightly fewer calories since\nthe drug\u2019s release. Airlines are even hoping that they will be able to consume\nless jet fuel because passengers will weigh less. Meanwhile, dialysis\nproviders are fearing for their business because patients might not need to\nhave their blood cleaned as often. And what does Knudsen think about all this?\nShe seems a bit taken by surprise.\n\nDER SPIEGEL: Do you still remember the day you signed your employment contract\nwith Novo Nordisk?\n\nLotte Bjerre Knudsen: That was in 1989. My first day at work was just before\nChristmas.\n\nDER SPIEGEL: Have you ever been dissatisfied with your contract?\n\nKnudsen: Never. Why should I be?\n\nAbout Lotte Bjerre Knudsen\n\nLotte Bjerre Knudsen, born in 1964, studied biotechnology and has worked for\nthe Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk since 1989, including many\nyears in drug discovery and development. She is interested especially in the\nuse of the peptide hormone GLP-1 to combat obesity. She has held a doctor of\nmedical science (DMSc) in scientific medicine from the University of\nCopenhagen since 2014 and served as an adjunct professor in translational\nmedicine at Aarhus University from 2015 to 2020. Before joining Novo Nordisk,\nshe traveled on the Trans-Siberian Railway.\n\nDER SPIEGEL: You have made Novo Nordisk Europe's most valuable company, with a\ngreater market capitalization than Daimler, Bayer, Lufthansa and BMW combined.\nDo you benefit financially?\n\nKnudsen: I don\u2019t care that much about money, I\u2019m a socialist! Here in\nScandinavia, we teach our children teamwork from an early age. It\u2019s not about\nthe individual. And that\u2019s how I am too. I have never asked for a raise in 34\nyears.\n\nDER SPIEGEL: You never got more money? Not even now?\n\nKnudsen: Yes, of course. But I didn\u2019t push. I can\u2019t see that capitalism and\nmoney make people happy. At Novo Nordisk, I have always preferred to use my\ncredibility to demand more funding for science, not more salary for myself. I\nalso have no intellectual property rights. They belong to the company because\nI gave them up when I was employed.\n\nKnudsen developed what is known as a GLP-1 receptor agonist for use against\npathological obesity: liraglutide. The agonist is the active ingredient in the\nweight loss drugs. For diabetics, Novo Nordisk currently markets semaglutide\nunder the brand name Ozempic \u2013 and as Wegovy for obesity. With a market\ncapitalization of more than 400 billion euros, the Danish company now has a\nstock market value greater than the current estimated gross domestic product\nof Denmark.\n\nDER SPIEGEL: When did you realize that you had created an active ingredient\nthat would revolutionize the world as a weight loss injection?\n\nKnudsen: I always secretly hoped for that outcome. I was less surprised that\nit became a weight-loss medication. In conversations with obese patients, I\nrepeatedly heard how stressful it is to be constantly hungry. Imagine feeling\nlike you always have to eat for 20 years. These people can now lead a more\nnormal life.\n\nDER SPIEGEL: Walmart is apparently now selling fewer frozen pizzas because of\nyour research. Did you expect such developments?\n\nKnudsen: My mother was a chef, so I\u2019m happy if Walmart is selling fewer\npizzas. It feels good to have worked on something that is important to many\npeople. But I try not to think about it too much. I\u2019m more interested in what\nelse I can do. However, I really like to count what the drug brings in\nfinancially for the company. That's my argument for new research funding.\n\nInsulin was the main product for Novo and Nordisk for a hundred years. Before\nit could be produced synthetically from the 1970s onwards, it had been made\nusing slaughterhouse waste products. Ozempic and Wegovy now account for more\nthan 50 percent of the company\u2019s revenues. In the third quarter of 2023 alone,\nthe company had an operating profit of over 3 billion euros.\n\nDER SPIEGEL: There are also moral concerns about your invention. Do you worry\nthat people will have to justify their obesity more in the future? Along the\nlines of: You could have taken the injection.\n\nKnudsen: I\u2019m more interested in the general question of why obesity should be\ntreated. Because if you do so, you significantly reduce the risk of\ncardiovascular disease. This is extremely valuable for people.\n\nDER SPIEGEL: But the medication is expensive and it isn\u2019t covered by health\ninsurance in many countries. So, will things remain as they are now: that\nbeing poor means being fat?\n\nKnudsen: I try not to worry too much about sales prices because there are\ncomplex decisions involved. It always takes a while for a new drug to reach\nthe general population.\n\nGlobal demand for the drug is huge, with serious consequences for diabetics.\nThey are dependent on medicines that are now regularly sold out in pharmacies.\nGermany\u2019s Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices is already\nconsidering a ban in Germany on the onward export of Ozempic.\n\nDER SPIEGEL: You invented the first drug for weight loss, liraglutide, back in\n1997. There was no hype at the time. Why is it different this time around?\n\nKnudsen: I think it has to do with the weight loss. With liraglutide, the\naverage weight loss per person was 8 percent; with its successor semaglutide,\nit is 17 percent. When we sought approval for liraglutide for obesity in 2014,\nit was the first time, and we did a lot of preparatory work for why you should\neven consider having medicines treat obesity. It wasn\u2019t really what people\nthought was important. When there were also setbacks in pharmaceutical\nresearch, for example when diabetes treatment was switched from injections to\npills, many companies walked away from the fight against obesity.\n\nDER SPIEGEL: We have a different supposition: Novo Nordisk grew up with\ninsulin, which will now be used less in the fight against diabetes. And your\ncompany didn\u2019t want to give up its old revenue generator.\n\nKnudsen: I\u2019m not buying that. Why didn\u2019t Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Pfizer\nand all the other manufacturers prioritize anti-obesity drugs?\n\nDER SPIEGEL: But you had to struggle against resistance within the company.\n\nKnudsen: It\u2019s true that over the years I\u2019ve clashed with some colleagues who\nfocus on insulin. People told me directly that they thought the GLP-1 peptide\nwas a bad idea. We wouldn\u2019t need new injectors for diabetes or obesity. Even\nour former CEO jokes today that he didn\u2019t believe in a successful anti-obesity\ndrug. But I was allowed to continue researching.\n\nKnudsen on the train as she commutes to work: She faced resistance within her\ncompany for the research that would later make headlines around the world.\n\nFoto: Jeppe B\u00f8je Nielsen / DER SPIEGEL\n\nDER SPIEGEL: Former COO K\u00e5re Schultz was thought to be particularly skeptical.\n\nKnudsen: I always listened to criticism very carefully and countered it with\nclinical data. I know a lot of people in the scientific community, and they\nhave helped me with some of the answers. Interestingly enough, a large\nproportion are from Germany. At the time, I was in contact with everyone in\nthe world who was researching GLP-1. Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day.\n\nDER SPIEGEL: And why did you continue?\n\nKnudsen: I am still motivated by the unmet need in the treatment of obesity\nand by the perspectives in the field. Also, a stroke in my immediate family\nsome years ago provided extra motivation to keep searching for ways to prevent\nsevere diseases.\n\nDER SPIEGEL: Semaglutide helps against diabetes, obesity \u2013 and possibly also\nagainst Alzheimer's. What else can it help with?\n\nKnudsen: The effectiveness against Alzheimer's has not yet been proven, but it\nis a hypothesis that we are investigating. However, when it comes to use\nagainst heart failure, the data is actually phenomenal. This is because GLP-1\ndrugs also dampen inflammatory processes in the body.\n\nOn social media, numerous A-listers are currently celebrating semaglutide for\nits slimming effect. American influencer Kim Kardashian swears by it, and pop\nstar Robbie Williams recently told the Times how he lost weight: \"Babe, I\u2019m on\nOzempic.\u201d\n\nDER SPIEGEL: What do you think about influencers promoting the product on\nTikTok and Instagram? It is a prescription medication, after all.\n\nKnudsen: I always tell people that they need to talk to their doctor. Every\nmedication has side effects, you should therefore ask your doctor. But I think\nit\u2019s OK for people to exchange ideas about this, as long as they adhere to the\nrules of their country. They also do that with blood pressure-lowering drugs.\n\nDER SPIEGEL: But there are only a few influencers who deal with blood pressure\nmedications. Entrepreneur Elon Musk promoted \"fasting\" and Wegovy. Does that\nworry you?\n\nKnudsen: My husband drives a Tesla, so Elon Musk is definitely close to me.\nAll joking aside: As a researcher, you shouldn\u2019t worry too much about the hype\non social media. I only use Facebook to keep in touch with family and\nneighbors. I do have an Instagram account \u2013 but only for food.\n\nDER SPIEGEL: And are you able to eat more carefree now thanks to your\ninvention?\n\nKnudsen: I love food, but that also means I have to restrain myself. I\u2019m\nexperimenting with periodic fasting. That means I don\u2019t eat anything before 11\na.m. or 12 p.m., and then only for eight hours. I don\u2019t do this to lose\nweight, but so that I can eat without thinking too much: even the delicious\ncake that is handed out in meetings. But fasting has taught me how difficult\nit can be to control your appetite and say \"no.\" Because it is often not true\nwhen obese people are confronted with the idea that it is their own fault for\ntheir weight. This is where genetics and biology meet the modern, affluent\nsociety.\n\nIn the past, obesity was difficult to control medically. Earlier slimming\nproducts were withdrawn from the market. And semaglutide also has side\neffects. A German authority has even pointed out the risk of cancer. Possible\nlong-term effects are unclear. Novo Nordisk nonetheless pays for Wegovy\nprescriptions, which cost hundreds of euros each month, for its employees and\ntheir spouses.\n\nDER SPIEGEL: What do you think about those people who see the injections as a\nlicense to eat whatever they want?\n\nKnudsen: Such a lifestyle is certainly not healthy. And on that point, the\nweight loss injection doesn\u2019t help. When I am asked about their use, I like to\nanswer: \"If you want the luxury of growing old, then you should take care of\nyourself.\" And by that, I don\u2019t mean taking our medication.\n\nDER SPIEGEL: There are some serious side effects. An increased risk of thyroid\ncancer and pancreatitis has been discussed, muscle atrophy or suspected\nincreased suicide rates under the use ...\n\nKnudsen: I am a scientist. We have done many studies to prove the safety of\nour drug. But yes, all medicines have side effects. With GLP-1 drugs, this is\nmost often nausea and malaise. Suicidal adiation was one of those things that\ncame with the rimonabant drug molecule. We studied the mechanism in order to\nshow that GLP-1 works in the brain on the well-described neurons that regulate\nappetite, fatigue and reward. We believe that there is no scientifically based\nrelevant risk with our product.\n\nDER SPIEGEL: If you start treatment with the drug, do you have to keep taking\nit for the rest of your life?\n\nKnudsen: As is the case with medications for other chronic diseases such as\ndiabetes or high blood pressure, it is a chronic treatment that only works as\nlong as the person is taking the medication. It\u2019s not a diet.\n\nDER SPIEGEL: There are reports that Novo Nordisk has invited American doctors\nwho will potentially prescribe semaglutide to expensive obesity seminars. And\nSwedish doctors are said to have received high fees for consulting work. Do\nyou think this is ethical?\n\nKnudsen: I think paying someone to take their time is OK. Of course, if we\ndidn\u2019t follow the rules, that wouldn\u2019t be OK. But we are intensively trained\nin how to deal with doctors and decision-makers. Fortunately, this is not the\njob of a researcher to deal with.\n\nThe battle for market share in GLP-1 products is in full swing. Eli Lilly, the\nAmerican company that has traditionally been Novo Nordisk\u2019s biggest\ncompetitor, is awaiting approval for a weight loss drug in Europe based on a\nmechanism similar to the one in Wegovy. The drug Zepbound is even said to work\nslightly better against obesity. Both companies are currently investing\nbillions of euros in the expansion of production in Europe. Novo Nordisk, for\nexample, at one of its most important plants in Kalundborg in Denmark and Eli\nLilly in Alzey, Germany.\n\nDER SPIEGEL: Katalin Karik\u00f3 received the Nobel Prize in 2023 for her research\ninto mRNA vaccination against COVID-19. You are considered the inventor of the\nweight loss injection. Are women better researchers?\n\nKnudsen: Basic researchers come up with new findings. Industry, on the other\nhand, is good at inventing applications. It doesn\u2019t matter whether men or\nwomen do it. However, women are probably underestimated and not always\nsufficiently appreciated. But there are role models: Just think of Marie\nCurie, who even won two Nobel prizes. Now, women are on the rise again after\nnot being very visible for a long time. I too know the feeling that being a\nwoman is a disadvantage.\n\nDER SPIEGEL: When did you feel disadvantaged?\n\nKnudsen: As a project manager in the 1990s and 2000s, it certainly would have\nbeen easier for me as a man.\n\nDER SPIEGEL: Why?\n\nKnudsen: During this time, some people labeled me as too passionate. Men, on\nthe other hand, were described as intelligent, hardworking or ambitious. I was\ncalled \"the mother of GLP-1,\" and I had a hard time with that for a long time.\nAt least until I saw the first season of \"Game of Thrones.\" There was a\ncharacter called \"Mother of Dragons,\" so I could come to terms with that\nattribution. And even though things have got better, unfortunately, a quirky,\nnerdy female scientist is still often treated differently than her male\ncolleagues.\n\nDER SPIEGEL: Are quotas for women the right way forward?\n\nKnudsen: We have had good experiences with this at Novo Nordisk. Socially, it\nwill take a few more generations to achieve complete equality. But we have to\nbe careful not to forget the men. This year, I also supported the \"Movember\"\nfor men\u2019s health in our company. What is crucial is that people who have good\nideas are able to get them through and have the feeling that they are allowed\nto do so.\n\nDER SPIEGEL: If you are the \"mother of\" in the company \u2013 are you also called\nthat at parties? The mother of weight loss injections?\n\nKnudsen: My nickname is actually \"Mutti,\" which must be strange for you\nbecause Germans usually think of \"Mutti\" as another person.\n\nDER SPIEGEL: Yes, Angela Merkel.\n\nKnudsen: The nickname also confused my family for a long time. Because until\nnow, they had no idea what exactly I was doing. This has only changed since\nthe newspapers started reporting on the drug.\n\nDER SPIEGEL: Ms. Knudsen, thank you for this interview.\n\n### Mehr lesen \u00fcber\n\nMedicine Health\n\nKostenlose Online-Spiele\n\nmehr Spiele\n\n  * Kreuzwortr\u00e4tsel\n  * Solit\u00e4r\n  * Sudoku\n  * Mahjong\n  * Bubble-Shooter\n  * Jackpot\n  * Snake\n  * Exchange\n  * 2048\n  * Doppel\n  * Rushtower\n  * Sudoken\n  * Street\n  * Wortblitz\n  * Fibonacci\n  * Gumblast\n  * Wimmelbild\n  * Skiracer\n  * Trivial Pursuit\n\nServiceangebote von SPIEGEL-Partnern\n\nGutscheine\n\nAnzeige\n\nOTTO Gutscheine\n\nLidl Gutscheine\n\nThalia Gutscheine\n\nTchibo Gutsheine\n\nTop Gutscheine Alle Shops\n\n  * Bu\u00dfgeldrechner\n  * Firmenwagenrechner\n\n  * Brutto-Netto-Rechner\n  * Jobsuche\n  * Kurzarbeitergeld-Rechner\n  * Studienf\u00e4cher erkl\u00e4rt\n\n  * Gehaltsvergleich\n  * Versicherungen\n  * W\u00e4hrungsrechner\n  * Unternehmen\n\n  * B\u00fccher bestellen\n  * Eurojackpot\n  * Ferientermine\n\n  * Gl\u00fccksSpirale\n  * Gutscheine\n  * LOTTO 6aus49\n\n  * Seniorenportal\n  * Spiele\n  * Streaming Guide\n\n  * Das t\u00e4gliche Quiz\n\nAlle Magazine des SPIEGEL\n\n  * DER SPIEGEL\n  * SPIEGEL GESCHICHTE\n  * SPIEGEL COACHING\n  * SPIEGEL WISSEN\n  * Dein SPIEGEL\n  * SPIEGEL BESTSELLER\n  * SPIEGEL CHRONIK\n  * SPIEGEL SPEZIAL\n  * SPIEGEL START\n  * SPIEGEL GELD\n  * S-Magazin\n  * SPIEGEL EDITION\n\nSPIEGEL Gruppe\n\nAbo Abo k\u00fcndigen Shop manager magazin Harvard Business manager 11FREUNDE\nWerbung Jobs MANUFAKTUR SPIEGEL Akademie SPIEGEL Ed\n\nImpressum Datenschutz Nutzungsbedingungen Teilnahmebedingungen Cookies &\nTracking Newsletter Kontakt Hilfe Text- & Nutzungsrechte\n\nFacebook Instagram Wo Sie uns noch folgen k\u00f6nnen\n\nDie Wiedergabe wurde unterbrochen.\n\n0:00\n\n0:00\n\nLotte Bjerre Knudsen: \"I don't care that much about money, I'm a socialist!\"\n\nFoto: Jeppe B\u00f8je Nielsen / DER SPIEGEL\n\nKnudsen on the train as she commutes to work: She faced resistance within her\ncompany for the research that would later make headlines around the world.\n\nFoto: Jeppe B\u00f8je Nielsen / DER SPIEGEL\n\n", "frontpage": false}
