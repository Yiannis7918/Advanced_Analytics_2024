Elderly cognitively healthy\nindividuals with APOE\u03b54 also exist, suggesting the presence of cellular\nmechanisms that counteract the pathological effects of APOE\u03b54; however, these\nmechanisms are unknown. We hypothesized that APOE\u03b54 carriers without dementia\nmight carry genetic variations that could protect them from developing\nAPOE\u03b54-mediated AD pathology. To test this, we leveraged whole-genome\nsequencing (WGS) data in the National Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Disease\nFamily Based Study (NIA-AD FBS), Washington Heights/Inwood Columbia Aging\nProject (WHICAP), and Estudio Familiar de Influencia Genetica en Alzheimer\n(EFIGA) cohorts and identified potentially protective variants segregating\nexclusively among unaffected APOE\u03b54 carriers. In homozygous unaffected\ncarriers above 70 years old, we identified 510 rare coding variants. Pathway\nanalysis of the genes harboring these variants showed significant enrichment\nin extracellular matrix (ECM)-related processes, suggesting protective effects\nof functional modifications in ECM proteins. We prioritized two genes that\nwere highly represented in the ECM-related gene ontology terms, (FN1) and\ncollagen type VI alpha 2 chain (COL6A2) and are known to be expressed at the\nblood\u2013brain barrier (BBB), for postmortem validation and in vivo functional\nstudies. An independent analysis in a large cohort of 7185 APOE\u03b54 homozygous\ncarriers found that rs140926439 variant in FN1 was protective of AD (OR =\n0.29; 95% CI [0.11, 0.78], P = 0.014) and delayed age at onset of disease by\n3.37 years (95% CI [0.42, 6.32], P = 0.025). The FN1 and COL6A2 protein levels\nwere increased at the BBB in APOE\u03b54 carriers with AD. Brain expression of\ncognitively unaffected homozygous APOE\u03b54 carriers had significantly lower FN1\ndeposition and less reactive gliosis compared to homozygous APOE\u03b54 carriers\nwith AD, suggesting that FN1 might be a downstream driver of APOE\u03b54-mediated\nAD-related pathology and cognitive decline. To validate our findings, we used\nzebrafish models with loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in fn1b\u2014the ortholog\nfor human FN1. We found that fibronectin LOF reduced gliosis, enhanced\ngliovascular remodeling, and potentiated the microglial response, suggesting\nthat pathological accumulation of FN1 could impair toxic protein clearance,\nwhich is ameliorated with FN1 LOF. Our study suggests that vascular deposition\nof FN1 is related to the pathogenicity of APOE\u03b54, and LOF variants in FN1 may\nreduce APOE\u03b54-related AD risk, providing novel clues to potential therapeutic\ninterventions targeting the ECM to mitigate AD risk.\n\nUse our pre-submission checklist\n\nAvoid common mistakes on your manuscript.\n\n## Introduction\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is typically characterized clinically by progressive\nmemory impairment and decline in other cognitive domains; however, there is a\nlong pre-symptomatic period without clinical manifestations [74]. At death,\npathological hallmarks in the brain include extracellular \u03b2-amyloid protein in\ndiffuse and neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles made of hyper-\nphosphorylated tau protein. AD, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is\ncurrently unpreventable, and, with available drugs only marginally affecting\ndisease severity and progression, remains effectively untreatable. A critical\nbarrier to lessening the impact of late-onset AD (LOAD) is the slow\ndevelopment of drugs that prevent or treat AD due, in part, to an incomplete\ncharacterization of the basic pathologic mechanisms. Determining which genes\nand gene networks contribute to AD could reveal the biological pathways for\ndrug development and inform the development of genetic testing methods for\nidentifying those at greatest risk for AD.\n\nThe presence of the APOE\u03b54 allele is among the most prominent genetic risk\nfactors for AD in White, non-Hispanic populations [21], but the associated\nrisks observed in African-Americans and Hispanics are somewhat lower [82].\nRelative risk of AD associated with a single copy of APOE\u03b54 is 2.5- to\n3.5-fold in Caucasians compared to 1.0\u20132.4 and 1\u20131.9 in African-Americans and\nHispanics, respectively [9, 82]. However, in every population, homozygosity\nfor the APOE\u03b54 allele is associated with increased risk and nearly complete\npenetrance [7, 64, 91]. APOE, a critical player in lipid metabolism and\ntransport, has been extensively studied for its role in Alzheimer's disease\n(AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders [14, 55, 56]. The APOE\u03b54 allele is\na well-established risk factor for late-onset AD, with carriers of this allele\nexhibiting an increased susceptibility to cognitive decline and dementia and\nearlier age at onset of clinical symptoms. However, within the population of\nAPOE\u03b54 carriers, there is variability in age of onset and severity of AD\nsymptoms. Some \"resilient\" or \"cognitively normal, unaffected\" individuals who\ncarry the \u03b54 allele do not develop AD or experience a delayed onset of\nsymptoms. Several potential factors might contribute to the variability in AD\nrisk and presentation among APOE\u03b54 carriers. Genetic modifier mutations\noutside of the APOE gene might interact with APOE\u03b54 to influence the risk of\nAD. APOE\u03b54 carriers might also be influenced by other risk factors for AD,\nsuch as vascular health, inflammation, and metabolic conditions. Interactions\nbetween APOE\u03b54 and these factors could modify the course of the disease.\nCertain rare protective variants in other genes could offset the risk posed by\nAPOE\u03b54.\n\nAmid the well-documented association between APOE\u03b54 and AD risk, a growing\nbody of evidence suggests intriguing nuances in the effects of this allele,\nparticularly in certain subsets of individuals who defy the expected\ntrajectory of cognitive decline and remain remarkably resilient to\nneurodegenerative diseases. Notably, heterozygosity of APOE\u03b54 has incomplete\npenetrance [31], and the polygenic risk of the rest of the genome could\nstratify APOE\u03b54 carriers into high- and low-risk strata. In this study, we\naimed to identify putative protective mechanisms, influenced by genetic\nmodifiers that might counteract the detrimental effects of the APOE\u03b54 allele.\nWe sought to identify \u201cprotective\u201d genetic factors that can modify or reduce\nthe effect of APOE\u03b54 on AD risk and to identify new pathogenic mechanisms,\nproteins, and pathways that inform development of therapeutic targets and\ndiagnostics.\n\n## Results\n\n### Whole-genome sequencing identifies putative protective variants in\ncognitively unaffected elderly APOE\u03b54 carriers\n\nWe accessed whole-genome sequencing data in 3,578 individuals from over 700\nnon-Hispanic White and Caribbean Hispanic families multiply affected by AD\n(Table 1). After harmonization and QC of the WGS data, we identified rare (MAF\n< 1% in gnomAD) coding variants in the healthy elderly APOE\u03b54 homozygous (over\nthe age of 70) and heterozygous (over the age of 80) carriers that were absent\nin non-carriers (Fig. 1). We further prioritized exon coding variants in\nhealthy APOE\u03b54 carriers that bear the potential to be damaging to the\nresulting protein product. Supplementary Tables 1\u20133 provide the lists of\ncandidate variants that were identified in cognitively unaffected elderly\nAPOE\u03b54 carriers. Our strategy and analysis pipeline are summarized in Fig. 2.\nWe found 510 variants in 476 genes that were present in at least 1% of APOE\u03b54\nunaffected homozygous carriers (388 in EFIGA/WHICAP and 130 in NIA-AD FBS and\n8 variants found in both datasets) (Supplementary Table 1 and 2). Two variants\n(rs116558455 and rs140926439) in the FN1 gene (fibronectin-1) were found in\nhealthy elderly \u03b54 homozygous carriers in EFIGA/WHICAP and NIA-AD FBS cohorts\nwith MAF = 1.85% and 3.33%, respectively (Table 2). In Hispanics, rs116558455\nwas absent in all APOE\u03b54 carriers with AD. In non-Hispanic Whites rs140926439\nwas absent in homozygous APOE\u03b54 AD patients, but found in 1% of heterozygous\npatients. Pathway analysis of the genes harboring variants segregating in\nAPOE\u03b54 carriers identified several biological pathways and molecular functions\nsuch as \u201cactin binding\u201d, \u201cmicrotubule binding\u201d, and \u201cextracellular matrix\nstructural constituent\u201d (Fig. 3). These results suggested a strong correlation\nwith cellular morphologies and the architectural organization of those cells.\n\nTable 1 Demographics of samples sequenced\n\nFull size table\n\nFig. 1\n\nStudy design.

This suggested that functional alterations in\nthe ECM composition could act as a protective mechanism in APOE\u03b54 carriers,\nboth heterozygotes and homozygotes without dementia. We hypothesized that\nAPOE\u03b54-related increase in ECM components could be counteracted by loss-of-\nfunction (LOF) variants in those genes, leading to protection through rescue\nof pathological mechanisms that those ECM components partake.\n\nTo test our hypothesis, we selected two genes from the variant lists that were\ncommon in ECM-related gene ontology classes (Fig. 3), collagen type VI alpha 2\nchain (COL6A2) and fibronectin 1 (FN1). These genes are well-known ECM\ncomponents that harbor putatively protective variants in APOE\u03b54 cognitively\nunaffected carriers. Additionally, prioritized variants in FN1 were,\nrespectively, present in both Hispanic and non-Hispanic White cohorts\n(Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Table 2). COL6A2 variation (rs777822883)\ngenerates a substitution of arginine at the 862nd residue to tryptophan, while\nFN1 variation (rs140926439) converts the glycine at the 357th position to\nglutamic acid. Since both alterations result in change in charged residues\n(loss in COL6A2, gain in FN1), we hypothesized that these variations could\nhave detrimental effect on the protein function, as charged interactions are\nessential for matric proteins and their stability [20, 61, 94]. Therefore, we\nanalyzed the AlphaFold structures of these proteins in Ensembl\n(http://www.ensembl.org) and found that both variations are potentially\ndetrimental according to SIFT, REVEL, and MetaL R predictions (Supplementary\nFig. 1). Arginine in COL6A2 at the 862nd position may coordinate with valine\n859 and glutamic acid 858 in the alpha helix structure, while glycine at the\n357th position in FN1 may provide structural stability by coordinating with\nglutamic acid 358 and serine 355 (Supplementary Fig. 1). Therefore, we\ncategorized these variants as likely loss-of-function alleles based on loss of\nelectrostatic interactions.\n\n### FN1 variant is protective in an independent cohort of APOE\u03b54 carriers\n\nWe queried an independent collection of AD-related genetic cohorts from\nseveral sources: the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Genetic Consortium (ADGC), the\nAlzheimer\u2019s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP), and United Kingdom Biobank\n(UKB) resources, primarily consisting of non-Hispanic White individuals of\nEuropean ancestry (EU) (Supplementary Table 4 and 5). A total of 465,669 NHW\ncase\u2013control individuals ages 60 and above were available after genetic and\nphenotypic quality control. Since rs116558455 is very rare in EU (gnomAD non-\nFinnish EU allele frequency = 0.016%), we focused on rs140926439 which is less\nrare in EU and thus provides sufficient allele counts to enable replication\nanalyses (gnomAD non-Finnish EU allele frequency = 0.46%). We specifically\nfocused analyses on APOE\u03b54/4 carriers ages 60 and above (N = 7185), to\ninterrogate whether there were any elevated frequencies for the rs140926439\nminor allele (T) associated with reduced AD risk and delayed age at onset.\n\nThe variant rs140926439 was associated with strongly reduced risk of AD in\nAPOE\u03b54/4 carriers (OR = 0.29; 95% CI [0.11, 0.78], P = 0.014; Table 3, Fig.\n4a). Sensitivity analyses were conducted, which ensured that any overlapping\nsamples with our discovery were excluded and corroborated primary findings (OR\n= 0.31; 95% CI [0.11, 0.87], P = 0.027; Supplementary Table 6, Fig. 4b).\nSecondary age at onset analyses further showed a significant protective effect\nin APOE\u03b54/4 carriers, delaying age at onset by 3.4 years for a single copy of\nthe minor allele (beta = 3.37; 95% CI [0.42, 6.32], P = 0.025; Fig. 4c). These\nanalyses represent the largest-to-date genetic association tests in a sample\nof APOE\u03b54/4 carriers at an age range relevant to AD.\n\nTable 3 Replication of FN1 variant in the ADSP and UKBB cohorts\n\nFull size table\n\nFig. 4\n\nReplication analyses. a Forest plot showing the association of rs140926439\nwith Alzheimer\u2019s disease risk in APOE\u03b54/4 carriers.

Cochran\u2019s Q test\nindicated no significant heterogeneity\n\nFull size image\n\n### FN1 deposition correlates with APOE\u03b54 dosage\n\nBased on our findings, we hypothesized that APOE\u03b54 dosage might correlate with\ndeposition of COL6A2 and FN1, at the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) basement\nmembrane, one of their prominent expression locations, as FN1 is an important\nsignaling molecule that interacts with specific integrins [69] expressed in\nvarious vascular niche cell types [52]. We immunostained and analyzed the\nbrains of 27 individuals with known APOE genotypes (8 APOE\u03b54/4 homozygous\ncarriers with AD, 8 APOE\u03b53/4 heterozygote carriers with AD, and 11 APOE\u03b54 non-\ncarriers (APOE\u03b53/3) with AD (Supplementary Table 7) for FN1 and CD31\n(endothelial cell marker), and COL6A2 and COL4 (a vascular basement membrane\nmarker) (Fig. 5, Supplementary Dataset 1, Supplementary Dataset 2). We found\nthat FN1 levels (Fig. 5a\u2013c\u2032) significantly increased with APOE\u03b54 dosage (Fig.\n5d, Supplementary Fig. 2). Compared to APOE\u03b53/3 individuals, FN1 expression\nincreased significantly in APOE\u03b53/4 (8.1%, P = 3.4e\u221202) and in APOE\u03b54\nhomozygous individuals (26.6%, P = 3.1e\u221209). Least squares linear regression\nand non-linear fit comparison of FN1 intensities according to the diameter of\nthe vessels showed that compared to APOE\u03b53/3, FN1 expression is more prominent\nwith increasing vessel size in APOE\u03b53/4 and APOE\u03b54/4 individuals (adjusted\nR^2: APOE\u03b53/3: 0.81, APOE\u03b53/4: 0.86, APOE\u03b54/4: 0.89; all P values are less\nthan 1.0xE-15 for non-zero significance of the slopes) (Fig. 5e).\nImmunostainings for COL6 (Fig. 5f\u2013h\u2032) showed a non-linear relationship between\nAPOE\u03b54 dosage and COL6 expression. APOE\u03b54 heterozygotes showed reduced (7.7%,\nP = 9.9e\u221203) homozygotes indicating increased levels of COL6 (6.7%, P =\n3.4e\u221202) (Fig. 5i). COL4 expression is only reduced in APOE\u03b54 heterozygotes\n(8.6%, P = 1.4e\u221203), but remain unchanged in homozygotes (Fig. 5i). The\nchanges in COL6 expression with blood vessel size was less pronounced\n(adjusted R^2: APOE\u03b53/3: 0.67, APOE\u03b53/4: 0.50, APOE\u03b54/4: 0.55; all P values\nare less than 1.0 \u00d7 E\u221215 for non-zero significance of the slopes) (Fig. 5j).\n\nFig. 5\n\nChanges in FN1 and COL6A2 according to APOE genotype. a\u2013c\u2032 Double IFS for CD31\n(green) and FN1 (red) with DAPI nuclear counterstain in APOE\u03b53/3 (a, a\u2032),\nAPOE\u03b53/4 (b, b\u2032) and APOE\u03b54/4 (c, c\u2032). d FN1 and CD31 intensity comparisons in\n2,044 blood vessels from 28 individuals. e Regression model for FN1 intensity\nwith respect to blood vessel diameter in three APOE genotypes. f\u2013h\u2032 Double IFS\nfor COL4 (green) and COL6A2 (red) with DAPI nuclear counterstain in APOE\u03b53/3\n(f, f\u2032), APOE\u03b53/4 (g, g\u2032) and APOE\u03b54/4 (h, h\u2032). i COL4 and COL6A2 intensity\ncomparisons in 1,816 blood vessels from 28 individuals. j Regression model for\nCOL6A2 intensity with respect to blood vessel diameter in three APOE\ngenotypes.

We\ntested this hypothesis by comparing FN1 and GFAP (marker for reactive gliosis)\nlevels in APOE\u03b53/3 (control, n = 2), APOE\u03b54/4 AD (n = 2), and APOE\u03b54/4\nunaffected (n = 6) individuals (Fig. 6, Supplementary Table 8, Supplementary\nDataset 3). We found elevated reactive gliosis and FN1 deposition in APOE\u03b54/4\ncarriers with AD compared to APOE\u03b53/3 controls (ANOVA adjusted P = 1.5E\u221202 for\nGFAP intensity, 4.1E-11 for FN1 intensity) (Fig. 6). APOE\u03b54/4 unaffected\ncarriers had FN1 and GFAP levels that were similar to that in controls (ANOVA\nadjusted P = 0.5245 for GFAP intensity, P = 0.8884 for FN1 intensity) (Fig. 6,\nSupplementary Fig. 3). This implies that the non-demented APOE\u03b54 carriers are\nprotected from gliosis and FN1 deposition (Fig. 6g, h).\n\nFig. 6\n\nFN1 deposition and gliosis reduce to control levels in APOE\u03b54/4 cognitively\nunaffected individuals, but not in APOE\u03b54/4 AD patients. a\u2013c Double IFS for\nFN1 (green) and GFAP (red) with DAPI nuclear counterstain in APOE\u03b53/3 (a),\nAPOE\u03b54/4 AD (b), and APOE\u03b54/4 cognitively unaffected individuals (c).\nBlack\u2013white images are individual fluorescent channels for FN1, GFAP, and\nDAPI. d\u2013f Two blood vessels in every condition are shown in high magnification\ntogether with FN1 channel alone. g FN1 intensity comparisons (2 APOE\u03b53/3\nindividuals without AD, 2 APOE\u03b54/4 individuals with AD, and 6 APOE\u03b54/4\nindividuals without AD). h GFAP intensity comparisons.

Zebrafish has two fibronectin\n1 genes: fn1a and fn1b [78]. Our single-cell transcriptomics analyses in the\nzebrafish brain showed that fn1b, but not fn1a is expressed in the zebrafish\nforebrain (Fig. 7a). fn1b expression is predominantly detected in vascular\nsmooth muscle cells and immune cells, while endothelia and astroglia express\nfn1b at considerably lower levels (Fig. 7b). Amyloid toxicity results in\nincreased fn1b expression in immune cells and vascular smooth muscle cells\n(Fig. 7b), similar to what we observed in AD brains (Figs. 5, 6). To determine\nthe effects of fibronectin function in amyloid-induced pathology, we used an\nfn1b full knockout zebrafish line (fn1b^\u2212/\u2212), which was previously\nfunctionally validated [33]. After treating wild-type and fn1b^\u2212/\u2212 animals\nwith A\u03b242, we performed immunohistochemical stainings for astroglia (red, GS)\nand tight junctions that mark vascular structures (green, ZO-1) (Fig. 7c\u2013f,\nSupplementary Dataset 4). Compared to wild-type animals treated with A\u03b242,\nfn1b^\u2212/\u2212 animals with A\u03b242 showed less colocalization of GS and ZO-1 (\u2212 16.3%,\nP = 5.3E\u221209), suggesting that gliovascular interactions were reduced with\nfibronectin loss of function (LOF) (Fig. 7g). Based on our previous findings\nthat reduced gliovascular contact upon amyloid toxicity is a protective\nmechanism through enhancing clearance of toxic protein aggregates and immune\nsystems activity [47], our results suggest that fibronectin could negatively\nregulate amyloid beta clearance and therefore an LOF variant could be\nprotective against disease pathology. By performing intensity measurements for\nastroglia with GS immunoreactivity, we observed that GS intensity reduces with\nfn1b LOF (\u2212 24.7%, P = 4.7E\u221203; Fig. 7h, Supplementary Dataset 5), indicative\nof reduced gliotic response upon A\u03b242. To determine the effect of fibronectin\non synaptic density and the number and activation state of microglia, we\nperformed immunostainings (Fig. 7i, j, Supplementary Dataset 6) and found that\nloss of fibronectin leads to increased numbers of total (41.5%, P = 8.7E\u221204)\nand activated microglia (64.3%, P = 2.9E\u221204). We did not observe change in the\nsynaptic density when A\u03b242-treated fn1b^\u2212/\u2212 was compared to A\u03b242-treated wild-\ntype animals (Fig. 7i\u2013k, Supplementary Dataset 7).\n\nFig. 7\n\nFibronectin loss of function affects gliovascular interactions, gliosis, and\nmicroglial activity after amyloid toxicity in zebrafish brain. a Feature plots\nfor fibronectin 1a (fn1a) and fibronectin 1b (fn1b) genes in zebrafish brain.\nb Violin plots in control and A\u03b242-treated brains. fn1b is mainly expressed in\nvascular smooth muscle cells and immune cells and is upregulated with A\u03b242. c,\nd Double IF for astroglia marker glutamine synthase (GS, red) and tight\njunction marker (ZO-1, green) in wild-type and fn1b^\u2212/\u2212 animals.

We base our\nconclusions on four main observations: (1) FN1 coding variants were present in\ncognitively unaffected APOE\u03b54 homozygous carriers, but not in affected\ncarriers with clinically diagnosed AD (Supplementary Table 1), and the\nprotective effect was independently replicated is a large cohort of APOE\u03b54\nhomozygous carriers. (2) Deposition of FN1 at the BBB basement membrane\nincreases with APOE\u03b54 dosage (Fig. 5). (3) Unaffected/resilient homozygous\nAPOE\u03b54 carriers above the age of 70 without AD have FN1 deposition levels\nsimilar to APOE\u03b53 control individuals (Fig. 6). (4) In the zebrafish brain,\nknockout of fn1b alleviates amyloid toxicity-related pathological changes\n(Fig. 7). These results suggest that the basement membrane thickening and\nremodeled ECM composition in the BBB may be a pathological contribution to\nAPOE\u03b54-mediated AD pathology that may be mitigated by variants in FN1 or other\nECM genes (Fig. 8). This conclusion is supported by the presence of variants\nin other BBB-related ECM components, such as LAMA1, LAMA3, and HSPG2, in\nunaffected elderly APOE\u03b54 carriers but not in carriers with AD (Supplementary\nTable 1). Therefore, our findings propose a new direction for potential\ntherapeutic interventions reducing the impact of APOE\u03b54-mediated risk of AD by\ntargeting the BBB basement membrane. Thus, we propose that fibronectin loss of\nfunction may be a protective mechanism for AD (Fig. 8).\n\nFig. 8\n\nSchematic abstract for the protective effect of FN1 variants\n\nFull size image\n\nAPOE\u03b54 has been associated with increased neuroinflammation and\nneurodegeneration, which can accelerate the progression of AD [63]. Our\nresults in zebrafish fn1b knockout model showed that reduced fibronectin 1\nincreased the gliovascular (GV) endfeet retraction and reduced gliosis. We\npreviously showed that the relaxed GV contact was a beneficial response to\namyloid toxicity [47] as it helps enhance the clearance of toxic aggregates\nthrough the bloodstream. Additionally, gliosis is an immediate response in\nastroglia to insult and prevents functional restoration of neuronal activity\nin disease [16, 29, 73, 93]. Independent reports showed that astrocytic\nremoval of APOE protects against vascular pathology [89], and gliosis is a\nmediator of amyloid-dependent tauopathy in late AD [6]. We propose that the\nrelationship of fibronectin with these processes is pathogenic, and reduced\nfibronectin could be protective by allowing more efficient clearance through\nthe bloodstream and reduced astrogliosis. The enhanced microglial activity\nsupports this hypothesis, as acute activation of microglia is a beneficial\nresponse to toxic protein aggregation [36, 62].\n\nOur results are consistent with the previous findings on APOE-dependent\nvascular pathologies and their relationship to AD [38, 45, 46, 56, 67, 79].\nEndothelial fibronectin induces disintegration of endothelial integrity and\nleads to atherosclerotic vascular pathologies [1, 18, 95], supporting our\nfindings that reduced fibronectin 1 protects the blood\u2013brain barrier integrity\ndisrupted by APOE\u03b54. Our findings are coherent with the previous observations,\nwhere AD-related changes in collagen and fibronectin around the blood\u2013brain\nbarrier (BBB) and alterations in the BBB's structure and function were\ndocumented [43, 80, 92]. Additionally, the serum levels of fibronectin\nincrease in AD patients in comparison to healthy individuals [15]. Collagen\nand fibronectin can also be early pathological markers of AD [48], where the\nincrease in the deposition and cross-linking of basement membrane around the\ncerebral blood vessels lead to a thickening of the basement membrane,\npotentially compromising its permeability and function [35, 67, 83, 84, 90].\nFibronectin expression levels in brain vasculature increases in AD [22, 41,\n49, 79, 88], where remodeling of the BM and replacing ECM with FN1 have been\nsuggested to indicate hypoperfusion and atherosclerosis-prone state [1, 46,\n54]. Additionally, APOE\u03b54 might regulate BM remodeling through inhibition of\npericyte-mediated matrix proteinase expression [55]. Pericyte degeneration,\nmural cell dysfunction, and alterations in cerebrospinal flow dynamics are\nlong-term consequences of vascular pathologies in aging and AD and is\naccelerated with APOE\u03b54 [5, 25, 27, 34, 38, 66]. Therefore, based on our\nfindings, we propose that excess ECM deposition and BM thickening with\ncollagen and fibronectin could promote the blood\u2013brain barrier breakdown.\nPotential loss-of-function variants in ECM genes are likely to render ECM\ncomponents non-functional, thus protecting against AD progression. Stronger\ninstructive interactions of collagen and fibronectin with their receptors on\nvarious BBB cell types in AD [39, 59, 79, 88] support this hypothesis.\nConsistently, FN1 provides attachment surface for immune cells, which\u2014when\nbecomes chronic\u2014damages the vascular functions, contribute to BBB breakdown,\nand loss of synaptic integrity.\n\nWe found that despite their APOE\u03b54/4 status, unaffected/resilient individuals\nwho do not develop cognitive decline have lower FN1 deposition and gliosis at\nthe vascular basement membrane that are not different from APOE\u03b53/3 control\nindividuals, but significantly lower than those in APOE\u03b54/4 AD patients (Fig.\n6). This demonstrated that FN1 is a critical component of APOE\u03b54-mediated\ndevelopment of AD, and a yet unknown protective mechanism against the effects\nof APOE\u03b54/4 genotype suppresses FN1 deposition. We propose that FN1 is a\ncritical downstream effector of APOE\u03b54 and reduced FN1 levels, either through\nrare, protective genetic variations in FN1 or through other resilience\nmechanisms, promoting protection against AD. An interesting future research\ncould investigate the other rare protective variants of APOE such as APOE\u03b52\n[28, 31] and APOE\u03b53 Christchurch [70] and their effects on the BBB basement\nmembrane.\n\nThe strength of this study is the cross-species design with pathological and\nfunctional validation to show that ECM component fibronectin could be related\nto key pathological aspects of AD such as toxic protein clearance, blood\u2013brain\nbarrier integrity, and microglial activity. We present the first knockout\nzebrafish for fibronectin 1 in relation to amyloid toxicity and identified\ncellular changes that relate to fibronectin activity.\n\nFurther studies could address some limitations of our study. First, the\nmechanism by which APOE\u03b54 enhances FN1 requires further investigations.\nAlthough in human and zebrafish brains, fibronectin is upregulated, the\nlongitudinal relationship of amyloid aggregation to FN1 activity needs to be\nanalyzed. Additionally, our genetic studies were conducted in clinically\nassessed individuals, and given the rarity of the FN1 mutation, we did not\nhave neuropathological assessments of APOE\u03b54/4 individuals with this rare\nprotective mutation. Future studies in large-scale neuropathologic cohorts are\nnecessary to demonstrate the pathological consequences of the rare FN1\nvariants. Finally, mechanistic studies of FN1 with and without the rare\nmutation are necessary to demonstrate the nuanced functional consequences.\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n### Ethics statement\n\nAll human samples were de-identified and the researchers could not infer or\nobtain personal information of the donors. Institutional Review Board approval\nfrom Columbia University Irving Medical Center and Mayo Clinic was taken\nbefore clinical data generation. Human cohorts and their characteristics are\nprovided below. Animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the\nanimal experimentation permits of the Institutional Animal Care and Use\nCommittee (IACUC) at Columbia University (protocol number AC-AABN3554).\nAnimals were maintained according to the Institutional Animal Care and Use\nCommittee (IACUC) standards of the Institute of Comparative Medicine at the\nColumbia University Irving Medical Center and the accepted guidelines [2, 30,\n44, 77]. The animal care and use program at Columbia University is accredited\nby the AAALAC International and maintains an Animal Welfare Assurance with the\nPublic Health Service (PHS), Assurance number D16-00003 (A3007-01). Animal\nexperiments were approved by the IACUC at Columbia University (protocol number\nAC-AABN3554). For zebrafish studies, 8- to 10-month-old wild-type AB strains\nor fn1b^\u2212/\u2212 homozygous knockout fish lines of both genders were used. In every\nexperimental set, animals from the same fish clutch were randomly distributed\nfor each experimental condition.\n\n### Human cohort information\n\nNIA-AD Family Based Study (NIA-AD FBS): This study recruited multiplex\nfamilies across the USA. Families were included if at least one member had a\ndiagnosis of definite or probable Alzheimer\u2019s disease [40, 51] with onset\nafter age 60 and a sibling with definite, probable, or possible disease with a\nsimilar age at onset. Demographic information, diagnosis, age at onset for\npatients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, method of diagnosis, Clinical Dementia\nRating Scale [37], and the presence of other relevant health problems were\navailable for each individual. The age at onset for patients was the age at\nwhich the family first observed signs of impaired cognition. For unaffected\nfamily members, we used their age at the time of their latest examination\nwithout impairment. Each recruitment site used standard research criteria for\nthe diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease [51]. For deceased family members who had\nundergone autopsy, the results were used to determine the diagnosis. For\nanalyses, clinical Alzheimer\u2019s disease was defined as any individual meeting\nNINCDS\u2013ADRDA criteria for probable or possible Alzheimer\u2019s disease [51] and\ndefinite Alzheimer\u2019s disease when CERAD pathological criteria [53] were met\npostmortem.\n\nWashington Heights/Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP): WHICAP is a\nmultiethnic, community-based, prospective cohort study of clinical and genetic\nrisk factors for dementia. Three waves of individuals were recruited in 1992,\n1999, and 2009 in WHICAP, all using similar study procedures [32, 60].\nBriefly, participants were recruited as representatives of individuals living\nin the communities of northern Manhattan who were 65 years and older. At the\nstudy entry, each person underwent a structured interview of general health\nand function, followed by a comprehensive assessment including medical,\nneurological, and psychiatric histories, and standardized physical,\nneurological, and neuropsychological examinations. Individuals were followed\nevery 18\u201324 months, repeating examinations that were similar to baseline. All\ndiagnoses were made in a diagnostic consensus conferences attended by a panel\nconsisting of at least one neurologist and one neuropsychologist with\nexpertise in dementia diagnosis, using results from the neuropsychological\nbattery and evidence of impairment in social or occupational function. All-\ncause dementia which was determined based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual\nof Mental Disorders, 4th Edition criteria [4]. Furthermore, we used the\ncriteria from the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative\nDisorders and Stroke\u2013Alzheimer Disease and Related Disorders Association to\ndiagnose probable or possible AD [51].\n\nEstudio Familiar de Influencia Genetica en Alzheimer (EFIGA): We used families\nfrom a different ethnic group to identify protective alleles in APOE\u03b54 healthy\nindividuals. This cohort comprises participants from a group of families from\nthe Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and New York. Recruitment, study design,\nadjudication, and clinical assessment of this cohort have been previously\ndescribed [86] as were details of genome-wide SNP data, quality control, and\nimputation procedures of the GWAS data [68, 85]. Participants were followed\nevery 2 years and evaluated using a neuropsychological battery [76], a\nstructured medical and neurological examination, and an assessment of\ndepression [65, 75]. The Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) [57, 58] and\nfunctional status were done and the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease\nwas based on the NINCDS\u2013ADRDA criteria [10, 50].\n\n### Whole-genome sequencing and quality control\n\nThe demographics of the individuals selected for sequencing is shown in Table\n1. WGS was performed at the New York Genome Center (NYGC) using 1 \u03bcg of DNA,\nan Illumina PCR-free library protocol, and sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq\nplatform. We harmonized the WGS and the EFIGA families (n = 307), and jointly\ncalled variants to create a uniform, analysis set. Genomes were sequenced to a\nmean coverage of 30\u00d7. Sequence data analysis was performed using the NYGC\nautomated analysis pipeline which matches the CCDG and TOPMed-recommended best\npractices [3]. Briefly, sequencing reads were aligned to the human reference,\nhs38DH, using BWA-MEM v0.7.15. Variant calling was performed using the GATK\nbest practices. Variant filtration was performed using variant quality score\nrecalibration (VQSR at tranche 99.6%) which identified annotation profiles of\nvariants that were likely to be real and assigns a score (VQSLOD) to each\nvariant.\n\n### Identification of variants segregating in healthy APOE\u03b54 individuals\n\nFirst, we filtered high-quality rare (MAF < 0.01 in gnomAD) variants with\ngenotype quality (GQ) \u2265 20 and depth (DP) \u2265 10. We then excluded any variant\nobserved in APOE \u03b54 non-carriers. Within variants that segregated in APOE\u03b54\ncarriers, we prioritized those that were observed in at least 1% of APOE\u03b54\nhomozygous healthy elderly (\u2265 70 years) and had additional support in healthy\nelderly (\u2265 80 years) heterozygous carriers. We further prioritized variants\nthat were absent in AD patients carrying an APOE\u03b54 allele. A simplified\npipeline is provided in Fig. 2.\n\n### Genotyping, amyloid administration, and tissue preparation\n\nA previously generated fn1b knockout line using CRISPR\u2013Cas9 gene editing [33]\nwas used in homozygous form. The full deletion was genotyped as described\n[33]. Amyloid-\u03b242 was administered to the adult zebrafish brain through\ncerebroventricular microinjection into the cerebral ventricle [13]. Euthanasia\nand tissue preparation were performed as per institutional ethics committee\napproval and international guidelines [13, 44]. 12-\u03bcm-thick cryo-sections were\nprepared from these brain samples using a cryostat and collected onto glass\nslides which were then stored at \u2212 20 \u00b0C.\n\n### Replication of FN1 variant\n\nAn in-depth overview of the methodology and analyses of replication datasets\nis provided in the Supplementary Text. The current study followed STREGA\nreporting guidelines. Participants or their caregivers provided written\ninformed consent in the original studies. The current study protocol was\ngranted an exemption by the Stanford Institutional Review Board because the\nanalyses were carried out on \u201cde-identified, off-the-shelf\u201d data; therefore,\nadditional informed consent was not required. Case\u2013control, family-based, and\nlongitudinal AD genetic cohorts were available through public repositories,\nwith genetic data from high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism\nmicroarrays, exome microarrays, whole-exome (WES) and whole-genome sequencing\n(WGS) (Supplementary Table 4\u20136). These data pertained to cohorts belonging to\nthe ADGC and the ADSP R3. We additionally used population-based data from the\nUKB, where we had access to health record information to derive case\u2013control\ndiagnoses [17].\n\nGenetic quality control procedures for the UKB are detailed elsewhere. ADGC\nand ADSP genetic data underwent extensive quality control, imputation to the\nTOPMed reference panel (for ADGC array-based samples) [26, 81], and ancestry\ndetermination (SNPweights v2.1) [19]. Duplicated individuals were identified\nand their clinical, diagnostic, and pathological data, as well as age at onset\nof cognitive symptoms, age at examination for clinical diagnosis, age at last\nexamination, age at death, sex, race, ethnicity, and APOE genotype, were\ncross-referenced across cohorts. Duplicate entries with irreconcilable\nphenotypes were excluded. APOE genotypes were adjudicated using state-of-the-\nart APOE prioritization approaches, filtering out samples where APOE genotypes\nlacked robustness (prioritizing APOE genotypes from sequencing data and cross-\nreferencing APOE genotypes from high-quality imputation with those provided in\nstudy demographics through various protein-based and DNA-based methods) [8].\n\nFinally, in all datasets, samples were filtered to ages 60 years and above,\ncases or controls, belonging to non-Hispanic White ethnicity and European\nancestry, and retaining only a single individual per cryptic relatedness\ncluster (determined down to third-degree relatedness). Secondary analyses\nevaluated associations with AD age at onset. Significant discoveries were\nconsidered at P < 0.05. All statistical analyses were conducted using R\n(v.4.2.1).\n\n### Immunohistochemistry\n\nPostmortem human brain sections from BA9 prefrontal cortex were obtained from\nNew York Brain Bank at Columbia University and Mayo Clinic Jacksonville as\nparaffin-embedded blanks and with neuropathology assessments (Supplementary\nTable 7 and 8). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed as described [47,\n87]. As primary antibodies FN1 (Proteintech, catalog number 66042-1-Ig,\n1:250), CD31 (Abcam, catalog number ab134168, 1:250), COL6A2 (Thermo Fisher,\ncatalog number PA5-65085, 1:200), COL4 (Thermo Fisher, 14-9871-82, 1:100), and\nGFAP (Thermo Fisher, catalog number OPA1-06100), and as secondary antibodies\ngoat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 448 (Thermo Fisher, catalog number A-21131, 1:500)\nand goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 555 (Thermo Fisher, catalog number A-21137,\n1:500) were used. In short, for deparaffinization and hydration, xylene and\nalcohol were used. Antigen retrieval was performed with citrate buffer (pH:\n6.0) or antigen retriever EDTA buffer (pH:8.5) in a pressure cooker or\nmicrowave for 18\u201325 min. Sections were blocked in 10% normal goat serum for 1\nh at room temperature and were incubated with primary antibody combinations\n(FN1-CD31, COL6A2-COL4 or FN1-GFAP) overnight at 4 \u00b0C in a humidified chamber.\nEach secondary antibody to the respective primaries was applied for 2 h at\nroom temperature. Slides were covered by mounting medium with nuclear\ncounterstain DAPI (Thermo Fisher, catalog number D1306, 5 ng/ml).\nImmunohistochemistry for zebrafish was performed as described [13]. In short,\nthe slides were dried at room temperature for 30 min and washed with PBS with\n0.03% Triton X-100 (PBSTx). Primary antibody combinations (ZO-1 + GS and SV2A\n+ l-Plastin) were applied overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Next day, after washing three\ntimes with PBSTx appropriate secondary antibodies were applied for 2 h at room\ntemperature. The slides were then washed several times before mounting using\n70% glycerol in PBS. The following antibodies were used: mouse anti-ZO-1\n(1:500, Thermo Fisher Cat. No. 33-9100), rabbit anti-glutamine synthetase (GS)\n(1:500, Abcam Cat. No. ab176562), mouse anti-SV2A (1:500, DSHB Cat. No. SV2),\nand rabbit anti-l-plastin (1:3000, gift from Michael Redd), secondary\nantibodies goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 448 (Thermo Fisher, catalog number\nA-21131, 1:500), and goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 555 (Thermo Fisher, catalog\nnumber A-21137, 1:500). For antigen retrieval of ZO-1 and SV2, slides were\nheated in 10 mM sodium citrate (pH:8.0) at 85 \u00b0C for 15 min before primary\nantibody incubation.\n\n### Image acquisition, quantification, and statistical analyses\n\nFive random illumination field images per patient from the immunostained\nslides were acquired using Zeiss LSM800 confocal microscope equipped with ZEN\nsoftware (version blue edition, v3.2, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Based on\nvascular markers, coronally sectioned blood vessels were delineated with the\nselection tool of ZEN software. Fluorescence intensity measures, diameter, and\narea was calculated. Acquisitions were performed in a blinded fashion (sample\nIDs, neuropathology details, and genotypes were revealed after the\nacquisition) and no vessels were specifically left out unless their diameters\nwere larger than 50 \u03bcm. GraphPad Prism software version 9.2.0. was used for\nthe statistical analyses. For multiple comparisons, one-way Brown\u2013Forsythe and\nWelch ANOVA test with two-stage linear step-up procedure of Benjamini,\nKrieger, and Yekutieli comparison with individual calculation of variances was\nused. For non-Gaussian distributions, non-parametric Kruskal\u2013Wallis test with\nDunn\u2019s multiple comparison test was performed. For correlation of vessel\ndiameter to fluorescent intensity, simple linear regression model and second-\norder polynomial robust regression with no weighting was used. Significance is\nindicated by \u2217(P < 0.0332), \u2217\u2217(P < 0.0021), \u2217\u2217\u2217(P < 0.002), ****(P < 0.0001).\nNo asterisks indicate non-significance. No sample set was excluded from the\nanalyses unless the histological sections were damaged severely during the\nacquisition of the sections (constitutes less than 3% of all sections\nanalyzed).\n\nFor zebrafish studies, the effect sizes for animal groups were calculated\nusing G-Power, and the sample size was estimated with n-Query. Four zebrafish\nfrom both sexes were used per group. For quantification of SV2-positive\nsynapses, 3D object counter module of ImageJ software was used with the same\nstandard cutoff threshold for every image. For quantification of\nactivated/resting l-plastin-positive microglial cells, two different\nmicroglial states were classified based on their cellular morphology: slender\nand branched as resting microglia; round and regular as active microglia. Six\nimages each from telencephalon sections were analyzed per animal. For\ncolocalization studies, vascular fields were determined using ZO-1 staining on\nsections (20 for every group), and colocalization with glial endfeet labeled\nwith GS stainings was performed using ImageJ software (v.2.1.0/1.53c) with its\ncolocalization test. Data acquisition was randomized with Fay (x, y, z\ntranslation) to acquire in total 1670 data points from two experimental\ngroups. R(and) correlation values from wild-type and fn1b^\u2212/\u2212 animals were\ncompared using GraphPad Prism (v.9.2.0). Intensity values for individual\nfluorescent channels were obtained with modal gray values and integrated\ndensity measurements using ImageJ. Comparison of 40 sections from two\nexperimental groups was performed. An unpaired non-parametric\nKolmogorov\u2013Smirnov t test was performed to test the statistical significance\nfor all analyses.\n\n### In silico structure prediction\n\nProtein structures, interspecies similarities, and the deleterious effects of\nvariants were analyzed by SWISS-MODEL protein structure homology-modeling\nserver through Expasy web server (https://swissmodel.expasy.org). SWISS-MODEL\nrepository entries for respective proteins were retrieved and compared to\ndesired protein orthologs using the superposition function. Deleterious\nmutation prediction was performed using Ensembl-integrated AlphaFold\nprediction model with SIFT, MetaLR, and REVEL modules for prediction of\ndeleteriousness.\n\n### Amyloid toxicity and single-cell sequencing\n\nAmyloid toxicity was induced as described [13, 47] in the adult telencephalon;\nthe brains were dissected and single-cell suspensions were generated as\npreviously described [23, 24]. Chromium Single-Cell 3\u2019 Gel Bead and Library\nKit v3.1 (10X Genomics, 120,237) was used to generate single-cell cDNA\nlibraries. Generated libraries were sequenced via Illumina NovaSeq 6000 as\ndescribed [12, 13, 23, 24, 71]. The cell clusters were identified using a\nresolution of 1. In total, 34 clusters were identified. The main cell types\nwere identified by using s100b and gfap for astroglia; sv2a, nrgna, grin1a,\ngrin1b for neurons; pdgfrb and kcne4 for pericytes; cd74a and apoc1 for\nmicroglia; mbpa and mpz for oligodendrocytes; myh11a and tagln2 for vascular\nsmooth muscle cells, kdrl for endothelial cells.\n\n## Data availability\n\nWhole Genome Sequencing data (WGS) from EFIGA and NIA-AD FBS cohorts that were\nanalyzed in the study have been deposited to NIAGADS (The National Institute\non Aging Genetics of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Data Storage Site) and are shared\nwith the research community as part of the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Sequencing\nProject (ADSP). The brain tissue used in this analysis was requested from the\nNew York Brain Bank at Columbia University. Raw data generated from the brain\ntissue and zebrafish experiments are available upon request. The zebrafish\ngliovascular single-cell dataset can be accessed at NCBI\u2019s Gene Expression\nOmnibus (GEO) with the accession number GSE225721.\n\n## References\n\n  1.

Additional families were\ncontributed to the NIA-AD FBS through NIH grants: R01AG028786, R01AG027944,\nRO1AG027944, RF1AG054074, U01AG052410. The NIA-AD FBS began in 2003 with the\ngoal of recruiting large, multiply affected families with late-onset\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) for genetic research. The study created a resource of\nwell-characterized families with late-onset AD. The initial phases of the\nAlzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) included genotyping of hundreds\nof participants from NIA-AD FBS. The ADSP Follow-Up Study heavily engages\nresources provided by the NIA-AD FBS and depends upon the longitudinal follow-\nup of families, and the collection of additional families, in particular those\nfrom diverse populations. Samples include biological materials for genome-wide\nassociation studies (GWAS) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS), peripheral blood\nmononuclear cells (PBMC) for stem cell modeling, plasma for studies of\nmetabolomics, proteomics, and biomarker research, and brain autopsy materials\nfor bulk RNA sequencing.

Estudio Familiar\nde Influencia Genetica en Alzheimer (EFIGA) is a study of sporadic and\nfamilial Alzheimer\u2019s disease among Caribbean Hispanics recruited from clinics\nin the Dominican Republic and New York (R01 AG067501). The goal of this study\nis to identify genetic variants that increase late-onset Alzheimer disease\nrisk in this ethnic group. This study was initiated in 1998 and recruited\nindividuals and their families in New York as well as from clinics in the\nDominican Republic. Recruitment for the EFIGA began in 1998, to study the\ngenetic architecture of AD in the Caribbean Hispanic population. Patients with\nfamilial AD were recruited and if a sibling of the proband had dementia, all\nother living siblings and available relatives underwent evaluation. Cases were\ndefined as any individual meeting NINCDS\u2013ADRDA criteria for probable or\npossible AD. EFIGA study is supported by NIA grants R56AG063908, R01AG067501,\nand RF1AG015473.
