He passed away\npeacefully at home following a short illness.Peter is renowned the world over\nfor his prediction of the existence of a new particle \u2013 the so-called Higgs\nboson \u2013 which he first proposed in 1964. It would be almost 50 years before\nthe particle\u2019s existence could be confirmed, with experiments at the Large\nHadron Collider at CERN finally confirming Higgs\u2019 theory in 2012. He was\njointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for this work in 2013, along with\nFran\u00e7ois Englert.Peter was also a great teacher and mentor, inspiring\ngenerations of young scientists. He was a remarkable individual \u2013 a truly\ngifted scientist whose vision and imagination have enriched our knowledge of\nthe world that surrounds us. His pioneering work has motivated thousands of\nscientists, and his legacy will continue to inspire many more for generations\nto come.Our thoughts are with Peter\u2019s family and all who knew and worked with\nhim.With very best wishes,Peter  \n---  \n| | | | | | | | More ways you can keep up to date:  \n---  \nStaff News | Bulletin Magazine | Advice and Support | Teaching Matters | Staff Twitter  \n---  \n| The University of Edinburgh is a charitable body, registered in Scotland,\nwith registration number SC005336.
