The university had previously said it was\ngoing to keep its test-optional policy through the entering class of fall\n2026.\n\nWithin hours of Harvard\u2019s announcement, Caltech, a science and engineering\ninstitute, also said it was reinstating its testing requirements for students\napplying for admission in fall 2025.\n\nThe schools had been among nearly 2,000 colleges across the country that\ndropped test score requirements over the last few years, a trend that\nescalated during the pandemic when it was harder for students to get to test\nsites.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nDropping test score requirements was widely viewed as a tool to help diversify\nadmissions, by encouraging poor and underrepresented students who had\npotential but did not score well on the tests to apply. But supporters of the\ntests have said without scores, it became harder to identify promising\nstudents who outperformed in their environments.\n\nIn explaining its decision to accelerate the return to testing, Harvard cited\na study by Opportunity Insights, which found that test scores were a better\npredictor of academic success in college than high school grades and that they\ncan help admissions officers identify highly talented students from low income\ngroups who might otherwise had gone unnoticed.\n\n## More on America\u2019s College Campuses\n\n  * Stanford\u2019s New President: The next president of the university will be Jonathan Levin, an economist who currently serves as dean of the graduate business school and whose association with the university dates back to his undergraduate days in the 1990s.\n  * Harvard\u2019s Applications Drop: Even as many other very selective schools hit record highs, applications to Harvard College were down this year, suggesting that a year of turmoil may have deterred students.\n  * Columbia University: Scientists in a prominent cancer lab at the university have now had four studies retracted and a stern note added to a fifth accusing it of \u201csevere abuse of the scientific publishing system,\u201d the latest fallout from research misconduct allegations.\n  * FAFSA Blunders: The Education Department was supposed to make applying for federal financial aid easier. Instead, the process got worse, plunging the college admission season into disarray.\n\n\u201cStandardized tests are a means for all students, regardless of their\nbackground and life experience, to provide information that is predictive of\nsuccess in college and beyond,\u201d Hopi Hoekstra, dean of the faculty of arts and\nsciences, said in a statement announcing the move.\n\n\u201cIn short, more information, especially such strongly predictive information,\nis valuable for identifying talent from across the socioeconomic range,\u201d she\nadded.\n\nCaltech, in Pasadena, Calif., said that reinstating testing requirements\nreaffirmed the school\u2019s \u201ccommitment as a community of scientists and engineers\nto using all relevant data in its decision-making processes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nHarvard and Caltech join a growing number of schools, notable for their\nselectivity, that have since reversed their policies, including Brown, Yale,\nDartmouth, M.I.T., Georgetown, Purdue and the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nFor Harvard, the move comes at a time of transition, and perhaps a return to\nmore conservative policies.\n\nLast June, the Supreme Court struck down race-conscious college admissions in\ncases involving Harvard and the University of North Carolina, raising fears\nthat with the demise of affirmative action, those schools would become less\ndiverse.\n\nAnd in January, Harvard\u2019s first Black president, Claudine Gay, resigned under\npressure from critics who said she had not acted strongly enough to combat\nantisemitism on campus after the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on Israel, and under\nmounting accusations of plagiarism in her academic work, which she stood by.\n\nThe provost, Alan Garber, was named interim president, while the dean of the\nlaw school, John Manning, became interim provost, the university\u2019s second-\nhighest administrative position. Mr. Manning is considered a strong potential\ncandidate to replace Dr. Gay. His background stands out for his conservative\nassociations, having clerked for the former Supreme Court justice Antonin\nScalia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn the current climate on campus, a return to test scores could be seen as a\nreturn to tradition. It also may address concerns of many parents that the\ncollege admissions process, especially in elite institutions, is inscrutable\nand disconnected from merit.\n\nApplications to Harvard were down by 5 percent this year, while those at many\nof its peer universities went up, suggesting that the recent turmoil may have\ndented its reputation. But it still received a staggering number of\nundergraduate applications \u2014 54,008 \u2014 and admitted only 3.6 percent. Requiring\ntest scores could make sorting through applications more manageable.\n\nCritics of standardized tests have long raised concerns that the tests helped\nfuel inequality because some wealthier students raised their scores through\nhigh-priced tutoring. But recent studies have found that test scores help\npredict college grades, chances of graduation and post-college success, and\nthat test scores are more reliable than high school grades, partly because of\ngrade inflation in recent years.\n\nBut Robert Schaeffer, director of public education at FairTest, an\norganization that opposes standardized testing, said Thursday that the\nOpportunity Insights analysis had been criticized by other researchers. \u201cThose\nscholars say that when you eliminate the role of wealth, test scores are not\nbetter than high school G.P.A.,\u201d he said, adding that it is not clear whether\nthat pattern is true among the admissions pool at super selective colleges\nsuch as Harvard.\n\nMr. Schaeffer said that at least 1,850 universities remain test optional,\nincluding Michigan, Vanderbilt, Wisconsin and Syracuse, which have recently\nextended their policies. \u201cThe vast majority of colleges will not require test\nscores.\u201d An exception, he said, could be the University of North Carolina\nsystem, which is considering a plan to require tests, but only for those\nstudents with a G.P.A. below 2.8.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nAcknowledging the concerns of critics, Harvard said that it would reassess the\nnew policy regularly. The school said that test scores would be considered\nalong with other information about an applicant\u2019s experience, skills, talents,\ncontributions to communities and references. They will also be looked at in\nthe context of how other students are doing at the same high school.\n\n\u201cAdmissions officers understand that not all students attend well-resourced\nschools, and those who come from modest economic backgrounds or first-\ngeneration college families may have had fewer opportunities to prepare for\nstandardized tests,\u201d William R. Fitzsimmons, Harvard\u2019s dean of admissions and\nfinancial aid, said in a statement.\n\nHarvard said that in the interest of selecting a diverse student body, it has\nenhanced financial aid and stepped up recruitment of underserved students by\njoining a consortium of 30 public and private universities that recruits\nstudents from rural communities.\n\nA correction was made on\n\nApril 11, 2024\n\n:\n\nAn earlier version of this article misstated Robert Schaeffer\u2019s position.
