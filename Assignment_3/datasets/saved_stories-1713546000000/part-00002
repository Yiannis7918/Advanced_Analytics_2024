Before joining Tsinghua I was a\nresearcher at VISA Research. In 2018 I got my Ph.D. from Boston University\nunder the guidance of Professor Ran Canetti and Professor Leonid Reyzin. I\nattended college at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I was seduced to\nscience by an interesting problem.\n\nMy research interest is cryptography. As cryptographers, our mission is to\nspread love with mystery. Occasionally I make comic slides to carry out my\nduty; see samples \"Merkletree\", \"Napoleon\", \"Howareyou\", \"VAR\",\n\"KuleshovEffect\", EC2020rump.\n\nNew: Quantum Algorithms for Lattice Problems [ eprint || Github ]\n\nUpdate on April 18: Step 9 of the algorithm contains a bug, which I don\u2019t know\nhow to fix. See the updated version of eprint/2024/555 - Section 3.5.9 (Page\n37) for details. I sincerely thank Hongxun Wu and (independently) Thomas\nVidick for finding the bug today. Now the claim of showing a polynomial time\nquantum algorithm for solving LWE with polynomial modulus-noise ratios does\nnot hold. I leave the rest of the paper as it is (added a clarification of an\noperation in Step 8) as a hope that ideas like Complex Gaussian and windowed\nQFT may find other applications in quantum computation, or tackle LWE in other\nways.\n\n[ Whatislife ] [ Resume ] [ Publications ] [ WhereamI ] [ Github ] [ Forbidden\nCity Crypto Day ]\n\n  * Cryptographers seldom sleep well\n  * My Favorite Open Problem\n  * Superluminal fiction\n  * Top 10 fake college ranking\n  * Why study Chinese\n\n  * Cryptography S2024\n  * Lattices F2023\n  * Cryptography S2023\n  * Lattices F2022\n  * Cryptography S2022\n  * Cryptography S2021\n\n", "frontpage": true}
