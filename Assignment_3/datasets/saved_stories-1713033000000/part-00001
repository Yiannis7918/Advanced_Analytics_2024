Which includes my story. I tell myself they are not the\nsame. Someday they won\u2019t. There will be a time I walk away. I can\u2019t live up to\nthis and won\u2019t try. \ud83e\uddf5 ^\n\nThis is not important. I have tweeted parts before and then deleted others.\nThere\u2019s no reveal. There no product line. Just looking back and what happened\nand what it meant.\n\nIt will probably be the last time I talk about this in detail.\n\nNothing is pre-written. I\u2019m just posting. ^\n\nMy dad was a trained aerospace engineer turned IT manager and IC for CRM/BI.\nMy mother was a childhood speech pathologist.\n\nI was raised in Silicon Valley and grew up with computers. My dad ran a web\nhosting/development side business so I had a T1 and spare hardware. In my\nroom. ^\n\nHad hardware and some assistance but my father is... distant. So I did not get\nmuch or ever ask for help. I started off having to build machines from parts\non the family room carpet and then get DOS running, for games like Doom and\nLemmings and Putt-Putt. Later Win3.1 confused me. ^\n\n(Note I was literally born in 1989 that is not a joke) My first online\ninteraction was on my dad\u2019s machine using newsgroups for some reason.\nEventually I got it on my PC. Don\u2019t remember any details. But my dad got\nhundreds of MSDN disks so I always had server and Microsoft software ^\n\nYes I was like 9 with a T1 and and MSDN subscription I promise you don\u2019t get\nas fucked as me without the universe conspiring. If you don\u2019t know about these\ngo look them up it\u2019s how you\u2019d get gigabytes of test software and keys before\nbroadband. Anyway I graduated to 95 then XP. ^\n\n(My PC in 1999 with cat Blanca) Anyway I was also a broken kid who would have\nabsolutely crashed and burned more if I was not so lucky to grow up in a\nhousehold with involved parent and ability to pay for therapy. We were upper-\nmiddle but I always just got used hardware parts. ^\n\nMy dad\u2019s interest as an engineer meant a workbench where I would take apart\nVCRs and cut through plastic electronics with a soldering iron. I eventually\nrepurposed a RC car on foam packaging + glued propeller as a RC boat.\n\nNever told anyone any of this. I\u2019m using you to dump. \ud83e\udd37\u2640\ufe0f\n\n> https://twitter.com/justwanttoq1/status/1777509307556229193\n\n^\n\nI had ongoing issues in schooling. I was transferred to a magnet middle school\nwith a crazy daily period of 30 eMacs. Learned Office then teacher left & rest\nof year we did whatever. Unfiltered internet. That Dino game. StickDeath was\nhuge. Absolute anarchy of technical commune. ^\n\nSkipping back: Due to what I had at home I started in elementary with\nFrontPage 97, Microsoft\u2019s discontinued website editor with crazy sitemap\ninterface. My dad provisioned website for me. I posted pics of animals and\nsplit them by pages. My internet was very fast so it was easy. ^\n\nI progressed to DreamWeaver. (Templates >>> CMS). I created one of the most\npopular gaming tips websites for an MMO. And I complained my middle school\nwebsite sucked. They let me take it over as a weekly class period in the\noffice. I rebuilt it. This was me: web.archive.org/web/2004041721... ^\n\n(Note the site looked way tighter natively in contemporary browsers.) Also\nnote: I never lie except when it\u2019s obvious joke or to trivially misdirect on\nwho I am. I learned a long time ago I\u2019m not good enough to track the endless\ntree of states that lying creates so I just don\u2019t. ^\n\nAnyway I was still a broken kid but I got cool local Silicon Valley high\nschool. Went through electronic accommodations from PDA to Toshiba M3500 XP\ntablet. I was reading ComputerWorld when I was bored in class because\ndisruptive kids ran everything. I\u2019m a loser whatever I know. ^\n\nHad a eMac lab in the library. Befriended the school admin, Adrian. Eventually\nit was a daily period where I helped him run things, based on Windows Server\nand such. I even accompanied him offsite to buy stuff but was 100% above-\nboard. Zero weird stuff ever. An Apprentice. Lucky. ^\n\nIt gets way weirder from here trust me. And I\u2019m skipping tons of shit too like\nthe elementary school Mac lab where I had some magic touch to help kids in a\ndrawing program save stuff or in middle school with teacher MacBook to TV\nadaptors. Don\u2019t care? Mute the thread. Continuing: ^\n\nWas great school. I took one of the last Photography high school electives\never from a veteran photog where our film camera\u2019s only electronic was an\nexposure meter and we developed our own film darkroom. Egg smell. Photoshop.\nVW pic in this I took in that class. Privileged, yes.\n\n> https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/734204860405407749\n\n^\n\nI had ongoing issue that were my own inadequacy. I transferred to a college\nprogram where I took half college, half high school classes at SJCC. There, I\nmade one of the greatest mistakes in my life. I didn\u2019t understand the context\nfor or appreciate what I had. I was a fool. ^\n\nWas top performer but cruel to teachers who I felt didn\u2019t match up. Then I\ntook the state test \u2013 and instead of answering \u2013 I used bubble scantron to\nmake bit art instead of test. I am a bad person. Admin of the program said it\nwould hurt them. I was called to the Superintendent. ^\n\n(It was a state test for statical scoring for funding in a small program so it\nwas bad. I may be too hard on myself. But I wish I could go back.) Anyway I\nfailed out of the best opportunity of my life and became a recluse doing\nremote education workbooks I could do in 10 minutes. ^\n\nI don\u2019t have much memory of or objective judgement on my status but one day I\nwas basically kidnapped and sent to a full-time rehabilitation program in\nUtah, mostly drug addicted teens and oppositional mental disorders. It was a\nnice place that tried. I cried every day for a year ^\n\nEvery day I just had my crying time in a bathroom or in bed silently. I knew I\nwas a failure but also resented my parents. Now, I don\u2019t think about it. We\ndon\u2019t mention it. Maybe it helped. Lucked out it was absolutely one of the\nnicer ones. Every other person had horrors. ^\n\nTroubled teens can be sent to this thing called \u201cwilderness\u201d where they strand\nyou in a wooded area with sadistic psychos and at night you get locked into a\nsleeping bag. One person told me they broke their arm on purpose and after\nhospital were sent back. Anyway. Moving on. ^\n\nOn that topic, looking back. Therapy is a great scoped treatment for certain\nissues. I eventually ended up at one of the most accomplished and published\npsychologists in the area. They were great. Outside medication it didn\u2019t help.\nI am not fixed by talking. That\u2019s my truth. ^\n\nI have a book-length story just in that year of living on a ranch tending to\ncows and horses before breakfast but skipping over to tell notables. This is\nthe GED I earned meanwhile. In Utah. Like I said. If you want to hire me I\u2019ll\nbe happy to show you I \u201ccompleted high school.\u201d ^\n\nThe thing about 17 is a year is forever. But not as long as summer break in\nkindergarten. Yet it is a long time. I learned to care for cows. I learned to\nride and interact with horses. Muck stalls. Sports. Be manual labor and not\ncomplain. (Again for many ppl it\u2019s a nightmare) ^\n\nEvery one of these posts I could write entire blog or book about but you don\u2019t\nhave time for that so we\u2019ll move on. And I did cry every single day I was\nthere. When arrived back, my childhood home was no longer. My bed was alien.\nUnease. But I had finished school. Time for a job. ^\n\nShit I didn\u2019t even mention being on the robotics team and what happened.\nAgain, I\u2019m leaving a lot out. Retrospective: I had always been technical\nbecause in those days to pursue tech hobbies you had to be. Shit broke all the\ntime. Nothing was compatible. I was forged in the fire. ^\n\nMy first forum was N64CC, because I loved the GameShark and wanted codes and\nadvice. Became a social pub for me. And that\u2019s where I learned about security.\nThe capability and impunity in those days was extreme for the skilled. I got\nto experience that. Thanks to a guy named Viper ^\n\nThe forums were some PHP bulletin board software. It was the 90s and sucked\nbut it worked. Occasionally a guy named Viper would hack the site and do shit.\nThe admin\u2019s admitted they couldn\u2019t do anything. Viper was exploiting the code\ndirectly. Luckily wasn\u2019t bad just annoyance. ^\n\nSo at a young age I was exposed to the idea of web vulnerabilities and 0days\nand the impunity they allowed bad actors. Wish I could thank Viper someday.\nThey did it for the lulz, not malicious. There was no ransomware back then.\nHacking was pure. It was humans and a machine. ^\n\nHacking at its absolute purest is demonstration of mastery. That\u2019s it. Just\nlike Tony Hawk doing 900\u2019s. It was an audience in the zone, not disrupting\nnormies. You could so you did. I was also on IRC, another thing I won\u2019t dive\ninto for brevity. I miss those days of ignorance.\n\n> https://twitter.com/minitru/status/1777908432340684832\n\n^\n\nThen joined TechTV/G4 forums and found my experience and outlook useful. I\u2019ve\nalways had to fix everything myself. And that taught me about computers. About\nWindows. Sorta. As a fool I still am. So it was not a stretch to be...useful.\nTo those lacking all but advice. I excelled. ^\n\nOh yeah I forgot to mention the reason I was failing at highschool is I was\naddicted to editing Wikipedia I\u2019m still a top-1000 account and built a part of\nsome tooling still in use today. I failed school because I just read the\nencyclopedia instead. My life is so fucking dumb. ^\n\nI arrive back home actually 17. And because we\u2019re being honest, my dad helped\nget me my first job as L1 helpdesk contractor for 2 months. I still had to\ninterview and impress the manager. The start date was 1 day before I turned\n18. The agency lied about my birthday to get me in. ^\n\nThe job was a temp supporting a temporary call center staffed by temps for an\nirregular business event. Setup and ghost machines from floppy, be L1 tech\nsupport, plug the mouse back in if they unplug it accidentally. Alongside like\n4 other temps? They were a gamut of... skills. ^\n\nAlso: Photos from residental treatment facility. Long story why I have them.\nFirst is the bottle room where before breaskfast every day you filled nipple\nbottles for calves in the field. That's my building, 22 double bunks. Other\nhouse other gender. Utah is fucking beautiful btw\n\n^\n\nEventually get car. Grandma stopped driving. 1991 Honda Accord. It would kill\nme and save me later in story. This is a view from the Lick Observatory,\ngreatest driving experience I've ever had if you're in the SF Bay Area. With\nmy first paychecks I bought a DSLR camera and drove.\n\n^\n\nI loved photography at a young age. Even as a child I hated myself. And I\nfigured out the best way to never be in front of a camera, is to be behind it.\nThere are almost no photos of me. Latest is probably my employee badge photo.\nI wanted to erase myself from the world. So I did ^\n\nAt my temp job I am continually retained as other temps are let go. I stay as\na temp for like a year and am the only one left. They hit some time limit and\nhired me full-time as staff. I would later accidentally delete the HR person\u2019s\nAD account that walked me through paperwork. ^\n\nShortly after that, they announce they are closing the west coast HQ. I won\u2019t\nexplain what that means. Everyone is told: We will pay to move you if you\nwant. Deadline 2 months. I don\u2019t sign up. This is all I know. But I get the\nidea. I have done this before. I have left my world. ^\n\nI tell my parents I\u2019m not doing it. But one day at 19 I decide I have no\nfuture in Silicon Valley. I will never own a home. I\u2019ll be a lessor of a room,\na bed. Like I was before in Utah. I walk into the Director\u2019s office. I tell\nthem I\u2019m going. And I tell my parents that night. ^\n\nAs a preview, I fly out to my new home and supervisor. On the flight I talk\nextensively with my seatmate. They ask if I want lunch with them when we land.\nI decline, saying I already have a car picking me up.\n\nI realize years later they were flirting with me. ^\n\nMy life is just constant L\u2019s interspersed with unlikely career advancement. ^\n\nOn my last day in California I am packing my 1991 Accord full of everything I\nwould take. I would drive thousands of miles. I was upset and bristly to a\nfinal doctor appointment I had. I came back rather than immediately go on. I\nsat on my bed. And I cried the hardest I ever have ^\n\nWhat had I done. I am 19. I will have nothing. I don\u2019t know how to be an\nadult. It will just be me. I am a sheltered fool. I give a final goodbye to my\nfamily, feeling terrible for my bruskness. I get in my 1991 Accord. With\neverything I have. And I drive. Across the horizon. ^\n\nI remember transiting through Los Angeles by the sudden low smog layer. I took\npictures and videos of my journey. Which I have lost forever due to misplaced\nconfidence and my own arrogance. A part of me is missing. It takes days. My\nfirst stay in hotels alone. Waypoints to a dawn ^\n\nI eventually arrive in the metro area on Cold War highways. I arrive in the\napartment complex. I go to the office. I unlock my apartment and walk into the\nirrevocable future. My mom thoughtfully included a basic folding chair, which\nI bring up. I sit and cry. What had I done. ^\n\nI know it seems like I cry a lot in this but now I don\u2019t and miss being able\nto emote. ^\n\nDecided I can\u2019t bore endless events so here\u2019s the accelerated timeline: I work\nin Helpdesk roles for 10 years+in new home. I thought I was my job title. I\nhad no hope of explaining to new companies, so I just stayed. I increasingly\ndo security stuff, January 2014 changes my life. ^\n\nIn January 2014 I suffer a car crash and traumatic brain injury. My 2001*\nAccord ends up tumbling down embankment. My head crushed against the inside to\na retention pond, almost drowning me. I am medivac\u2019d to a tier-1 stoke\nhospital. And I do not create new memories for 3+ days. ^\n\nMy body has lacerations I see every day in morning. I suffer traumatic brain\ntrauma, can\u2019t really describe. Half my facial nerves are shot and droop. My\nleft eye is cross-eyed. I can barely walk. Likely never drive again. Don\u2019t\nknow if I even know anything. Could never recover. ^\n\nGet to local physical therapy place after parents flew in, but beyond walking\nno progress. I do not deny my luck or ascribe to myself. I opt not to know my\nIQ score. And I am left with an abundance of time of ponderance. I am 24. Can\nI work? Do I know anything? What is left? ^\n\nI get evaluated for a disability services pass because I can\u2019t drive. Every\nday I get moved around on a group bus, seeing other lives. Talking to them for\nhours across rides and therapies. I met a lot of teens brain damaged from\nmotorcycles. I\u2019ve commented before on their tragedy ^\n\nI talk to an emergency response person who was there. They said if my car was\nany older I\u2019d have been dead. If my car was much newer, I\u2019d have maybe opened\nthe door and walked away. That\u2019s all they saw. All the time. You lived or\ndied. It was the machine that weighed the scale. ^\n\nIn my time off from work I need to figure out if I know anything. I join a\nsecurity forum and prodigiously post. One day Heartbleed arrives. I used\nTwitter since 2007. I had experience in one-day novelty accounts. So I made\nSwiftOnSecurity. I cringe at parody. Fact, not intent. ^\n\nI knew not a lot past music tracks, no opinion she was dumb. Respected the\nlyrical finesse. A time of crap jokes about her open-hearted nature, thus\nHeartBleed. And I made a few heartbleed posts. On premise Taylor Swift was\nsecretly 100% legitimately a cybersecurity expert. ^\n\nSomething I tried to make clear was the joke was never she was dumb. A bimbo\nplayed to the crowd. The conceit was, why would you doubt she\u2019s this smart?\nShe\u2019s got time. She\u2019s intelligent. She\u2019s good with language. I wouldn\u2019t swear\nor post during appearances. Tried to be earnest. ^\n\nI was not a Taylor Swift fan before this. I was not a swiftie. It was a dumb\ncringe joke for a day, but not in anyway meant to be dismissive. But. It turns\nout, she is truly smart as fuck? She is a master of her craft. Accomplished\nand would only become more so. What had I done. ^\n\nI\u2019ll be honest, parodic Twitter culture of 2014 is somewhat alien today. There\nwas no seriousness. Novelty accounts were huge. There was no risk of\nmisunderstanding. My original name was \u201cInfoSec Taylor Swift.\u201d Would that fly\ntoday? Absolutely not. It\u2019s cringe. That is history. ^\n\nThe car crash had probably made me dumber, but it gave me this driving\ncompulsion to write in styles of formal indulgence. And I wanted to know, did\nI even know all the words? So past the dumb jokes I embarked on an AI doom\ntheme. Cringe? Not 2015. Judge me. That\u2019s the story.\n\n^\n\nI don\u2019t expect you to today respect me from 2015 but I\u2019m at least going to\nexplain. This is not my professional identity it\u2019s something I use to foster\nconversation and shitpost. I\u2019ve been cringe. But I was earnest. Do you want\nthe truth or a lie. I can be a liar if you prefer. ^\n\nI realized later \u201cbeing\u201d SwiftOnSecurity was my hope. It was the outlay that I\ncould ever be respected. That I could ever work in security. That I could be\nbeautiful. It was a vehicle for fantasy. It was something I could desperately\ninhabit. It was a lie. A lie for an ugly duck. ^\n\nSkipping a bunch, I decided to kill myself. I was a misshapen ugly fool. I buy\na shotgun shipped to a local FFL dealer. I picked out a reclusive field near\nmy work. I bought a tarp to make cleanup easier. I get a shotgun carry bag,\nfor some reason. And then at work I get a call. ^\n\nSomehow, my billing address got automatically filled in as California, maybe\ndue to browser extension. While my shipping address was my new state. They\ncalled me. In my cube. They asked me what to do. I\u2019m an agnostic. But I took\nit as a sign. I was wrong.\n\nI cancelled the order. ^\n\nIt was too late to cancel the shotgun bag. I get it and put it in my car\ntrunk, unsure what to do. On a visit my mom asks what it is. I don\u2019t remember\nwhat I said. It was a lie. I threw it away sometime later. ^\n\nAs a child, you need someone to tell you to go on. To live. But as an adult\nit\u2019s just you. Your thoughts. A thousand miles from anchor. You have to\ndecide. Continually, in adversity. I decided not to continue \u2013 but the\nuniverse intervened. And that day I decided to live. ^\n\nI\u2019m skipping over incredible amounts of my life here. Professional, personal.\nSomething I want to highlight is Sysmon, by @markrussinovich. It changed my\nlife. It helped saved it. Because when I decided to live, it was the\nspringboard. I\u2019ll explain shortly. ^\n\nWindows is a General Purpose Operating System designed for extensibility and\nuser changes in a time before modern viruses. It is an incredible system. It\nWon. But there are hundreds, thousands of way to \u201cextend\u201d it built on\ninnocence that made it, that malicious programs exploit. ^\n\nHow do you monitor this? Well you mostly Don\u2019t. Sorta. Until Mark released\nSysmon, which could real-time audit sensitive areas in the OS much more\npowerful than before. Problem was, it\u2019s a blank slate requiring endless hours\nand knowledge to leverage into monitoring an enterprise ^\n\nAgain skipping insane amounts of my professional life, I knew the power of\nthese file locations and registry areas. Not just security, but Helpdesk. Same\nareas viruses use, random programs fuck shit up. So. I decided to be the\nfirst. To make Sysmon work. (Why I\u2019m ~famous btw)\n\n^\n\nI publish the only comprehensive system-wide configuration for Sysmon. It has\nbeen recommended by training and books and governments as a basis for\nsecurity. When I released it I had a choice. Under my name as a nobody for\ncareer advancement. Or SwiftOnSecurity, for popularity. ^\n\nAt that time I was planning to not exist. I did not matter. What was important\nwas sharing what I had made. Not my name. So I created a SwiftOnSecurity\nGitHub. And I published it. @markrussinovich would later highlight it in\npresentations on using Sysmon.\n\ngithub.com/SwiftOnSecurit... ^\n\n@markrussinovich sysmon-config is now the basis for all public Sysmon\nconfigurations (which have superseded it) and multiple commercial product\nrulesets, including one my employer pays for. I know because it includes a\nmistake I made. I\u2019m honored. But nobody will ever know my name. I chose that.\n^\n\n@markrussinovich Just like in photographs. Like in my tools and edits for\nWikipedia. My contributions to Windows security monitoring. My personality\nhere. I decided to erase myself from the world. I decided to not exist. And I\ndid it. I won. I\u2019m okay with that, now. It is its own sort of freedom. ^\n\nI would later miraculously mostly? recover from my brain injury, mostly the\nnerves. I can now see straight. My face works 99% like before. They said it\nwas due to my age, they didn\u2019t want to promise anything. If 48 and you get hit\nin the head you\u2019re prob just fucked forever sry\ud83e\udd37\u2640\ufe0f ^\n\nIf you talk to me, you may know there is something wrong. Humans are like\nthat. The face is an organ of impossible truth to the visual cortex. You will\nnotice the side with the ever subtle droop. My slight slur of words you can\u2019t\ndescribe. I\u2019m branded. But I lived. I chose to. ^\n\nIf this sounds like super hot to you @ me ^\n\n@robbycooper The 70-200 F2.8 IS certainly helped. I still have that lens lol.\nI didn't have rent so I was... a bit spendy on that hobby. ^\n\nI was recently prompted to comment on influencers. I don\u2019t. It\u2019s fine done\nright. A few partners know who I am because I thought they were interesting,\nbut I do not own their products in my role. I\u2019m just. I\u2019m just a person. A\nhandful of coworkers know but they do not tell people ^\n\nI\u2019m concerned many do not understand \u2018SwiftOnSecurity\u2019 is not a professional\nidentity or alias. It\u2019s not a resentful illicit insider. It\u2019s an escape I\u2019m\nprivileged to have autonomy to post in about certain things most don\u2019t. I\ncannot be this. That\u2019s okay. It\u2019s good. I\u2019m glad. ^\n\nNear home stretch. I decided to live. I decided my life wasn\u2019t good enough. It\nwas time to be aggressive. I started applying to places. I flew to Microsoft\nfor interview. I\u2019m glad didn\u2019t get was not right role but so privileged to\nvisit I\u2019m so glad. Core memory. (Ft @film_girl\u2764\ufe0f)\n\n^\n\n@film_girl Yeah that\u2019s right I haven\u2019t just been making shit up this whole\ntime it\u2019s wild getting told someone\u2019s actual life story not a version with\nsexy eternal vampires. ^\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nMissing some Tweet in this thread?

Its progression goes industrial IBM\nsolutions with all services included, to piecemeal solutions separating\nsoftware and hardware, to innumerable OS options and hardware, to standardized\nhardware and narrowing OS options, to 90\u2019s businesses\n\nAs these options narrowed, Windows offered a solution in NT Domains with a\ncompelling, if junior way, to solve the hardest problem in computing:\nInteroperability and per-user security across server and client. There were\nothers we won\u2019t get into them. It was a huge success.\n\nRead 19 tweets\n\n#### SwiftOnSecurity\n\n@SwiftOnSecurity\n\nMar 18\n\nIf you\u2019re an influencer: inspire hope instead of despair \u2013 because trust me\nI\u2019ve iterated despair and it\u2019s fucking worthless. These Zoomers have every\nreason to give up. They never hear a reason to persevere. It\u2019s easy to fail.\nIt takes the exceptional to disregard. And live.\n\nI\u2019ve been the person who tried to die. Who wanted to, most of my life. I\u2019ve\n_been_ that game. I\u2019ve lived it. And survived it. And let me tell you.\nFulfilling demand for that idol dipshit feeding narrative is easy. That\u2019s the\nmainstream advertising busks. Persevering is exception.\n\nThe fools all follow the path to exhaust money and give up. You have to. The\npills. The courses. The denigration of a life lived in simple honor. They\u2019re\nplaying your death to feed their exuberance. That Bugatti is hundreds dead.\nAnd it means _nothing_ to them. You are the cost.\n\nRead 5 tweets\n\n#### SwiftOnSecurity\n\n@SwiftOnSecurity\n\nMar 16\n\nWhenever you see NIMBY\u2019s in a city council meeting and blocking housing,\nremember they\u2019re doing it to steal hundreds of thousands of dollars from the\nnext buyer of their house. They are freeriders with a decaying asset expecting\nsomeone to kiss their feet for the opportunity.\n\nImagine if people stood outside a car factory blocking assembly so their 1996\nOldsmobile became a rarity in a world where you have to drive to work. It\u2019s\nextortion and fake.\n\nI\u2019m fortunate to own a house now, and I see the dogshit incentives to me. I\ncan try to stop housing anywhere in the city and my Zillow line just goes up\nmore. Doing nothing but impeding society. I see it for what it is. These lying\ndipshits.\n\nRead 10 tweets\n\n#### SwiftOnSecurity\n\n@SwiftOnSecurity\n\nMar 5\n\nWhat is the right timeout for a laptop to lock itself?\n\nIMO computer lock should be ~30 minutes for orgs without biometric login.\n(This is NOT my org policy) Making Security people feel better is not the\ngoal. I\u2019m unconvinced local attacks are remotely notable enough to incur the\ncosts of employees having to continually login.\n\nSecurity people should develop better protective measures and access controls\nand monitoring instead of sloughing it off to some poor schmuck just trying to\ndo their job in a game of responsibility hot-potato.\n\nRead 15 tweets\n\n#### SwiftOnSecurity\n\n@SwiftOnSecurity\n\nFeb 25\n\nI want someone to touch me like this\n\n> https://twitter.com/mokei_tetudou/status/1761294143245128062\n\nAs hands approach, I feel anticipation. The warmth of the fingers encircles\nme, a gentle yet firm grip that promises exploration. The first touch is\ntentative, a soft brush against the cool, plastic surface of my body. I revel\nin the sensation , the contrast with pliable skin.\n\nExploration begins in earnest - gliding over my exterior, tracing the lines\nand curves with curiosity. The touch is gentle, reverent, as if understanding\nthe care that went into me. Movable and precise, my turret is carefully\nrotated, its exercise a rush of lubricated action.\n\nRead 14 tweets\n\n## Did Thread Reader help you today?\n\nSupport us!
