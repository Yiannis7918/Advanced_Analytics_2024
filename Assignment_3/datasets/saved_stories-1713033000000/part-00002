In this study the first author aimed\nto examine the effects of local genetic manipulation of local nerves\ninnervating individual tumours on the individual tumour dynamics, and thus\nselected experiments in which individual tumours were used as n = 1 (n = 8\ntumours per group). However multiple individual tumours within one animal were\nused as one group. The first author failed to describe this situation and in\nthe figure legends stated that n = mice in each group. The investigative\ncommittees of Okayama University and National Cardiovascular Research Center\nin Japan performed an investigation into this matter and concluded that the\ncalculated numbers of animals necessary for all experiments were more than the\npurchased number of animals when n = 8 rats/mice per group. The committee also\nstated that the details of each experiment, raw data, primary data and\noriginal drawings were not submitted to the Okayama University Investigation\nCommittee as objective evidence during the investigation. The committee also\nconcluded that there were several errors in the description of virus particles\nin this paper and confirmed that irregularities had been identified in the\nfollowing figures:\n\n  * Figure 1\n\n  * Figure 1e and 5e,\n\n  * Figure 2e and 5e,\n\n  * Figure 6e and Supplementary Figure 2b,\n\n  * Figure 3d and 5d\n\n  * Figure 7g and Figure 7h\n\n  * Supplementary Figure 17f and Supplementary Figure 17h\n\n  * Supplementary Figure 20c and Supplementary Figure 20h\n\n  * Supplementary Figure 20f and Supplementary Figure 20h\n\n  * Supplementary Figure 28e and Supplementary Figure 28g\n\n  * Supplementary Figure 30b and Supplementary Figure 30g\n\n  * Supplementary Figure 30e and Supplementary Figure 30g\n\n  * Supplementary Figures 17c\u2013g and Supplementary Figures 28b\u2013f\n\n  * Supplementary Figures 20c\u2013g and Supplementary Figures 30b\u2013f\n\nAdditionally the Research Ethics Committee of National Cardiovascular Research\nCenter and National Cancer Center have stated that the authors did not have\nthe appropriate ethics approval for the use of the human specimens in this\nstudy.\n\nShigeki Kato, Akihiko Shimomura, Takushi Shimomura, Kazuto Kobayashi and\nTakahiro Ochiya agree to this retraction. Ryosuke Kaneko and Yuchio Yanagawa\nhave not responded to any correspondence from the editor about this\nretraction.
