(Getty)\n\n## AI is a powerful tool, but it's not a magic ingredient for every product.\nIf the benefit is not clear or seems like something you could do yourself\neasily, it might just be buzzword marketing\n\n  * Follow us:\n\nWhatsappFacebookTwitterTelegramGoogle News\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is one keyword that sticks out like a neon light\nin the misty sky of technological wonders. The AI mania has reached a new\nhigh, with businesses of all kinds rushing to develop \u2018smarter\u2019 products\npowered by the technology.\n\nA few years ago, Microsoft founder Bill Gates stated that AI can be humans\u2019\nfriend. Similarly, financial wizards like Warren Buffett once said that AI\nwill change the world. Recently, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, at the Intel Vision\n2024 conference, stated that every company will embrace AI as he unveiled AI\nchip Gaudi 3.\n\nBut none of these statements implies that certain consumer electronics or\ntechnology businesses would lose their wits and begin plastering AI labels on\nproducts only to attract people, without any value addition.\n\nFor example, AI smart mattresses claim to be using a variety of sensors to\nmonitor users\u2019 sleep habits and general health, dynamically responding to\ntheir specific demands in real time. Developers of these smart mattresses\nclaim that they may considerably enhance sleep quality, allowing for a faster\nstart of sleep and promoting deeper, more restorative sleep.\n\nBut since it has an \u2018AI\u2019 and \u2018smart\u2019 tag, the high prices raise eyebrows,\nmaking them out of reach for many potential consumers. Furthermore, there is\nrising concern about the possible risks of excessive sleep surveillance.\nCritics warn that overreliance on such technologies may unintentionally\nincrease sleep-related worries such as misjudging the presence of a sleep\nproblem, which may cause unnecessary anxiety.\n\nExamples of products that might be overhyping their AI features also include\nAI-powered toothbrushes. In the vast landscape of oral hygiene, the act of\nbrushing teeth has evolved from ancient practices to modern ones. While rural\ncommunities often rely on traditional neem twigs for dental care, urbanites\nhave embraced the convenience of toothbrushes and toothpaste. But in recent\nyears, the market has witnessed the rise of electric toothbrushes, promising\nsuperior oral cleanliness with each oscillation.\n\nAmidst this dental revolution, companies are introducing the next frontier:\nAI-enabled toothbrushes. These futuristic gadgets boast advanced technology\nand massive price tags. Oral health experts speculate that these AI\ntoothbrushes may feature sensors to monitor brushing habits and offer real-\ntime feedback via accompanying apps. But they also argue that while the\nfeedback can be beneficial, it is not pushing the boundaries of what AI is\ncapable of.\n\nQuestions also linger regarding the substantiation of these claims. Are these\nAI toothbrushes backed by comprehensive studies involving hundreds of\nparticipants? Where is the empirical data validating their efficacy?\nScepticism arises as consumers grapple with the notion of blindly accepting\nAI-labeled products solely based on marketing hype.\n\nSimilarly, another overhyped product would be AI refrigerators. As AI extends\nits reach into our homes, even our humble refrigerators are getting a\nfuturistic makeover. But the question arises: do we really need our\nrefrigerators transformed into AI-powered assistants? While AI fridges boast\nof features like generating shopping lists and recommending recipes based on\ninventory, critics argue that these functionalities merely replicate tasks\nalready performed manually or through existing digital platforms. What is the\nproblem it will be solving?\n\nMoreover, the integration of Wi-Fi connectivity in AI fridges raises privacy\nconcerns. Imagine a scenario where your fridge\u2019s camera monitors your\ngroceries, potentially collecting data on your eating habits. This information\ncould be exploited by companies to bombard you with hyper-personalised ads or\ninfluence your dietary choices, potentially leading to unhealthy habits.\nAdditionally, AI-generated recipe recommendations may not always prioritise\nhealth or cater to individual needs, promoting fad diets or unhealthy\nsubstitutes based on limited data.\n\nIn the realm of culinary tech, there are AI cooking devices which promise to\nrevolutionise meal prep by cooking with Artificial Intelligence. However, they\nfall short in capturing the essence of cooking, as taste, smell, and texture\nremain vital aspects that AI struggles to replicate. Beyond this limitation,\nthe complex technology driving these machines renders them costly to purchase\nand maintain. Additionally, their widespread adoption will face challenges as\nthey fail to address any significant consumer needs.\n\nTo spot genuine AI applications, there are a few things consumers need to look\nat. Does the AI address a real need and improve the product\u2019s functionality in\na meaningful way? Can the AI adapt and learn over time? Does it offer helpful\ninsights or automate complex tasks? Also, if the AI features seem like a minor\nadd-on, the price increase might not be justified.\n\nAI is a powerful tool, but it\u2019s not a magic ingredient for every product. If\nthe benefit is not clear or seems like something you could do yourself easily,\nit might just be buzzword marketing.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nBhaswati Guha Majumder\n\nBhaswati Guha Majumder, Senior Correspondent at News18, has been passionately\ncovering stories related to technology, business (infrastructure),\ngover...Read More\n\nfirst published:April 11, 2024, 11:14 IST\n\nlast updated:April 11, 2024, 11:14 IST\n\n## Latest News\n\nMore Latest News\n\n## LIVE TV\n\n## TRENDING VIDEOS\n\n## Latest Blogs\n\n## Photogallery\n\n## Welcome!\n\n# Our site asks for your consent to use your personal data to:\n\n  * perm_identity\n\nPersonalised advertising and content, advertising and content measurement,\naudience research and services development\n\n  * devices\n\nStore and/or access information on a device\n\n  * How can I change my choice?\n\n  * What if I don't consent?\n\n  * How does legitimate interest work?\n\n  * Do I have to consent to everything?\n\nYour personal data will be processed and information from your device\n(cookies, unique identifiers, and other device data) may be stored by,\naccessed by and shared with 136 TCF vendor(s) and 63 ad partner(s), or used\nspecifically by this site or app.\n\nSome vendors may process your personal data on the basis of legitimate\ninterest, which you can object to by managing your options below.
