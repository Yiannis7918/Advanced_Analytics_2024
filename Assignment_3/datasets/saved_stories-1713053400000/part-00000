We are committed to cutting the net CO2 flux from crust to\natmosphere as quickly as possible. As solar power gets cheaper, there will\ncome a time when it is cheaper to get carbon from the atmosphere than an oil\nwell. That time is now.\n\nProduct Information\n\nUpdates\n\nMarch 2024: Terraform completes the end to end demo, successfully producing\nfossil carbon free pipeline grade natural gas from sunlight and air. We also\nachieved green hydrogen at <$2.50/kg-H2 and DAC CO2 at <$250/T-CO2, two\nincredible milestones.\n\nFebruary 2024: We hired Arvind Nagarajan and Russell Newman to join the\nengineering team, both bring decades of experience at the highest levels of\nengineering. Nathan Schuh has also joined us to work on ramping electrolyzer\nproduction.\n\nJanuary 2024: Terraform won a DOE-funded study with Energywerx, with which we\nare completing our 45V eligibility life cycle analysis (LCA).\n\nDecember 2023: We were joined by Brian Towle and Jett Ferm of Second Group\nDesign to help with our winter fabrication push. They will work mostly on\nsorbent regeneration for our ground-breaking direct air capture of CO2\nprocess.\n\nNovember 2023: Our integrated solar-electrolyzer test rig successfully\nproduced hydrogen at the predicted efficiency, validating our approach to low\ncost beyond-the-grid solar.\n\nOctober 2023: Our Gen 3 reactor achieved >99% conversion of CO2 to methane.\nOur Gen 7 electrolyzer hit key purity and current density targets. Major\ncongratulations to the team - both these achievements are on the edge of the\nimpossible and they made them look easy.\n\nSeptember 2023: We were invited to meet with ARPA-E program managers to\ndiscuss beyond-the-grid dynamically operated electrolyzers - one of our core\ntechnology achievements. Also, you should be working on hardware.\n\nAugust 2023: We hired Dr Stephen Robinson, a materials science/manufacturing\nexpert and also a very accomplished rock climber!\n\nJuly 2023: Preliminary life cycle analysis on the Terraform process shows a\ncarbon intensity of <0.02 kg-CO2/kg-CH4, 140x less than fossil natural gas.\n\nJune 2023: We welcomed our summer interns Jasmin, Ava, Shefali, and Swetha,\nwho are already hard at work on projects they get to lead.\n\nMay 2023: Our electrolyzer team hit our target current density of 200 mA/cm^2,\nvalidating our ultra-low cost design and target efficiency.\n\nApril 2023: We raised a $6m seed extension round to complete our product\nprototype, the Terraformer, and run a pilot operation. As usual, we are\nhiring!\n\nMarch 2023: We participated in the SXSW panel discussion on Atoms vs Bits\nalong with space industry expert Lauren Lyons, Darby Dunn of Commonwealth\nFusion Systems, and Skyler Shuford of Hermeus.\n\nFebruary 2023: We signed an offtake agreement with PG&E. Together with our\nagreement with SoCalGas, we now have access to >90% of California's gas\nmarket, worth ~$20b/year.\n\nJanuary 2023: We commissioned our Gen 2 Sabatier reactor, ran our first full\nscale electrolyzer cell tests, and began construction of our CO2 recovery\nkiln.\n\nEnd of 2022: We built our early team, captured CO2, generated hydrogen, and\nsynthesized natural gas. In 2023, we are working to integrate these processes\nat meaningful scale and move towards commercialization.\n\nDecember 2022: We brought in Dr Lucie Nurdin (Caltech chemical engineer) to\nwork on the Sabatier reactor which converts CO2 and hydrogen into natural gas,\nand Kyle Cothern (former SpaceX, Hyperloop, Vast) to supercharge our\nelectrolyzer development. We made significant progress on an improved process\nfor sorbent regeneration.\n\nNovember 2022: In our conversations with customers, investors, and potential\npartners we've discovered a bunch of neat, counterintuitive facts that TI's\ntechnology brings into the world. If power is cheap, low efficiency is good.\nShort ROI is good. Many technical problems are soluble in cheap power. Local\nsolar is better than long distance transmission. We need a LOT of solar\npanels. CO2 production correlates with wealth - the problem is fossil\nhydrocarbons, not CO2 per se. Our process is 1000x more energy efficient than\nphotosynthesis. Our competition is fracking, and we'll use ~80% of all solar\nlong term. We also built pelletizers to regenerate our sorbent and the next\nelectrolyzer prototype.\n\nOctober 2022: We crunched the impact of the IRA on our business model. The 45V\ngreen hydrogen PTC is worth nearly $32/kcf, and the 45E green electricity PTC\nis worth another $13.50/kcf. There are a bunch of other state and federal\nsubsidies for carbon capture, low carbon fuel, etc and in aggregate they\naccelerate our profit margins by about a decade - which is to say we would be\nvery profitable if in production today.\n\nSeptember 2022: Signed our first natural gas offtake agreement with SoCalGas.\nCongratulations to the business team for this major milestone.\n\nAugust 2022: We commissioned our in house gas chromatograph, confirming >96%\nconversion of CO2 into CH4. The Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law,\ncontaining a number of compelling production credits which significantly\naccelerate our timeline to profitability and enormous scale.\n\nJuly 2022: First methane from our in house Sabatier reactor. Congratulations\nto Arun Johnson for rapid execution of this task.\n\nJune 2022: This month our four formidable interns started. Arun Johnson is\nworking on the Sabatier reactor. Graham Kersey is working on the calcination\nsystem. Tiana Wong has joined the business team with David and Crystal. Jason\nLe is working on the electrolyser.\n\nMay 2022: Welcome Dr Crystal Dilworth, who will run our post carbon industrial\nstrategy.\n\nApril 2022: We finalized a lease on our first facility in Burbank, California.\nIt can deliver 2400 amps of 480 V 3 phase power and, most importantly, it's a\ncastle!\n\nMarch 2022: This month we were joined by Ryan Okerson who will be mechanically\nengineering our atmospheric carbon conversion machinery. Ryan joins us after a\nstellar career at Hyperloop and SpaceX, where he was the RE of Starlink solar\narrays.\n\nFebruary 2022: The real estate search continues.\n\nJanuary 2022: Terraform Industries is excited to announce that David Smyth, Dr\nStephanie Coronel and Jenna Amundson have joined our mission to make natural\ngas better and cheaper with sunlight and air.\n\nDecember 2021: Terraform Industries has raised a $5m seed round from Nat\nFriedman and Patrick Collison to profitably deliver industrial scale\natmospheric hydrocarbon synthesis and drive down net flux of crustal CO2 into\nthe atmosphere.\n\nCareers\n\nAre you mechanically intuitive?
