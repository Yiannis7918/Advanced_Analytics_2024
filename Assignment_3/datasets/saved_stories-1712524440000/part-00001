On Feb. 20, Proofpoint researchers observed TA578\nimpersonating various companies to send legal threats about alleged copyright\ninfringement. If a link on the impersonated site was visited, the victim was\nredirected to a landing page personalized to display both the victim\u2019s domain\nand the name of the impersonated company reporting the copyright infringement.\nThe URL then downloads a malicious JavaScript file from a Google Firebase URL.\n\n## Did Latrodectus emerge as a response to 2023 crackdown on Qbot?\n\nKen Dunham, cyber threat director at the Qualys Threat Research Unit, added\nthat Latrodectus emerged in late 2023 following a government crackdown on Qbot\ninfrastructure, one of the oldest malware campaigns in the wild that has been\nactive since 2007.\n\n\u201cBattling eCrime is similar to moving a couch where roaches live, they simply\nrun to another piece of furniture or room nearby to seek harbor and continue\nbusiness as normal, despite any actions taken by the homeowner,\u201d said Dunham.\n\u201cLatrodectus has powerful components upon its emergence, capable of defeating\nsandboxes, and use of RC4 encrypted command-and-control communications. It\nappears likely that actors behind QBot felt the heat from takedowns last year,\nmigrating to this new code base and infrastructure in the fall of 2023.\u201d\n\nLactrodectus and IcedID share many similarities, such as the way they\ncommunicate to their C2, and even commands such as \"cmd_run_icedid\" that\ndownloads and runs bp.dat, the IcedID bot, explained Adam Neel, threat\ndetection engineer at Critical Start.\n\nNeel said it\u2019s becoming clear that Lactrodectus isn't too different from\nIcedID, but it does demonstrate sandbox evasion tactics not utilized by\nprevious IcedID loaders. After initialization, Neel said the malware will\ncheck it's environment to confirm that it\u2019s not running in a sandbox by\nconfirming the amount of running processes on the device, then checking to\nmake sure it is running on a 64-bit host. Lastly, the malware looks to see if\nthe host has a valid MAC address.\n\n\u201cThese sandbox evasion techniques can slow down researchers and defenders from\nanalyzing samples of Latrodectus,\u201d said Neel. \u201cOverall Latrodectus is still\nsimilar to IcedID, but it\u2019s important for researchers to keep an eye on it as\nit continues to evolve. It\u2019s possible that this is not the last form of\nLatrodectus and it could continue to grow and differentiate itself from IcedID\nmore in the future.\u201d\n\nSteve Zurier\n\n### Related\n\nNetwork Security\n\n##### Bing ad posing as NordVPN aims to spread SecTopRAT malware\n\nLaura FrenchApril 5, 2024\n\nThe remote access trojan creates a second hidden desktop to control the\nvictim\u2019s browser.\n\nNetwork Security\n\n##### Financial sector targeted by new JSOutProx RAT variant\n\nSC StaffApril 5, 2024\n\nBleepingComputer reports that phishing attacks with an updated JSOutProx\nremote access trojan variant have been deployed against financial entities in\nSouth and Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.\n\nData Security\n\n##### Phishing campaigns with updated Rhadamanthys, Agent Tesla malware\nreported\n\nSC StaffApril 5, 2024\n\nOrganizations in the oil and gas industry have been targeted with a phishing\ncampaign that involved the deployment of a new Rhadamanthys information-\nstealing malware variant, The Hacker News reports.\n\n### Related Events\n\n  * Cybercast\n\n##### Top Ten ATT&CK Techniques: The Rise of \u2018Hunter-Killer\u2019 Malware\n\nOn-Demand Event\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n### Get daily email updates\n\nSC Media's daily must-read of the most current and pressing daily news\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.
