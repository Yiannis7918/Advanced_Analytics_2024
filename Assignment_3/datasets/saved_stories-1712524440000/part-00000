The pair noted that while many studies had examined\nprivacy issues with third-party apps for Apple devices, very little literature\ninvestigates the issue in first-party apps \u2013 like Safari and Siri.\n\nThe aims of the study [PDF] were to investigate how much data Apple's own apps\ncollect and where it's sent, and to see if users could figure out how to\nnavigate the landscape of Apple's privacy settings.\n\nThe lengths to which Apple goes to secure its ecosystem \u2013 as described in its\nPlatform Security Guide [PDF] \u2013 has earned it kudos from the information\nsecurity world. Cupertino uses its hard-earned reputation as a selling point\nand as a bludgeon against Google.\n\nBourdoucen and Janne Lindqvist don't dispute Apple's technical prowess, but\nargue that it is undermined by confusing user interfaces.\n\n\"Our work shows that users may disable default apps, only to discover later\nthat the settings do not match their initial preference,\" the paper states.\n\n\"Our results demonstrate users are not correctly able to configure the desired\nprivacy settings of default apps. In addition, we discovered that some default\napp configurations can even reduce trust in family relationships.\"\n\nThe researchers criticize data collection by Apple apps like Safari and Siri,\nwhere that data is sent, how users can (and can't) disable that data tracking,\nand how Apple presents privacy options to users.\n\nThe paper illustrates these issues in a discussion of Apple's Siri voice\nassistant. While users can ostensibly choose not to enable Siri in the initial\nsetup on macOS-powered devices, it still collects data from other apps to\nprovide suggestions. To fully disable Siri, Apple users must find privacy-\nrelated options across five different submenus in the Settings app.\n\nApple's own documentation for how its privacy settings work isn't good either.\nIt doesn't mention every privacy option, explain what is done with user data,\nor highlight whether settings are enabled or disabled. Also, it's written in\nlegalese, which almost guarantees no normal user will ever read it.\n\n\"We discovered that the features are not clearly documented,\" the paper\nconcludes. \"Specifically, we discovered that steps required to disable\nfeatures of default apps are largely undocumented and the data handling\npractices are not completely disclosed.\"\n\n### Apple users struggled to grasp privacy options\n\nThe authors also conducted a survey of Apple users and quizzed them on whether\nthey really understood how privacy options worked on iOS and macOS, and what\napps were doing with their data.\n\nWhile the survey was very small \u2013 it covered just 15 respondents \u2013 the results\nindicated that Apple's privacy settings could be hard to navigate.\n\nEleven of the surveyed users were well aware about data tracking and that it\nwas mostly on by default. However, when informed about how privacy options\nwork in iOS and macOS, nine of the surveyed users were surprised about the\nscope of data collection.\n\n  * Apple slams Android as a 'massive tracking device' in internal slides revealed in Google antitrust battle\n  * In-app browsers are still a privacy, security, and choice problem\n  * The way Apple, Alphabet implemented DMA rules 'seems to be at odds' with law\n  * Mozilla CEO quits, pushes pivot to data privacy champion... but what about Firefox?\n\nConcerning the amount of data Safari collected, one participant remarked: \"I\nwasn't aware of that ... if I would search for anything sensitive, then I\nwould switch browser.\"\n\nUnsurprisingly, Apple's \"Family Sharing\" feature was a bit contentious, as it\nallows users to share info such as their location. Seven participants liked\nthe idea, but the remainder were less positive on privacy grounds.\n\nUsers were also tested on their knowledge of privacy settings for eight\ndefault apps \u2013 including Siri, Family Sharing, Safari, and iMessage. According\nto the study, none could confidently figure out how to work their way around\nthe Settings menu to completely disable default apps. When confused, users\nrelied on searching the internet for answers, rather than Apple's privacy\ndocumentation.\n\nThe lack of consistent settings across Apple devices was also a key issue \u2013\neven though iPhones and Macs often share many of the same apps, like iMessage.\niCloud also has its own settings, adding to the confusion.\n\nAssuming Apple has any interest in fixing these shortcomings, the team made a\nfew suggestions. Since many users first went to operating system settings\ninstead of app-specific settings when attempting to disable data tracking, a\nchange could assist users. Centralizing these options would also prevent users\nfrom getting frustrated and giving up on finding the settings they're looking\nfor.\n\nInforming users what specific settings do would also be an improvement \u2013 many\nsettings are labelled with just a name, but no further details. The\nresearchers suggest replacing Apple's jargon-filled privacy policy with\ndescriptions that are in the settings menu itself, and maybe even providing\nsome infographic illustrations as well. Anything would be better than\nlegalese.\n\nWhile this study probably won't convince Apple to change its ways, lawsuits\nmight have better luck. Apple has been sued multiple times for not\ntransparently disclosing its data tracking. One of the latest suits calls out\nApple's broken promises about privacy, claiming that \"Apple does not honor\nusers' requests to restrict data sharing.\"\n\nWe've asked Apple for its thoughts on the Finnish study's findings, and will\nlet you know if someone in Cupertino has a response. \u00ae\n\nReminder: Apple has a multi-billion-dollar online ads business that it built\nwhile strongly criticizing Facebook and others for their privacy practices.\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Apple\n  * iOS\n  * iPhone\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Apple\n  * iOS\n  * iPhone\n  * macOS\n  * Privacy\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * AirTag\n  * Apple M1\n  * App stores\n  * cookies\n  * iCloud\n  * iMac\n  * iPad\n  * iPod\n  * iTunes\n  * Mac\n  * MacBook\n  * Privacy Sandbox\n  * Safari\n  * Siri\n  * Tim Cook\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Operating System\n  * Smartphone\n  * Steve Jobs\n  * Steve Wozniak\n\n#### More about\n\n25 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Apple\n  * iOS\n  * iPhone\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Apple\n  * iOS\n  * iPhone\n  * macOS\n  * Privacy\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * AirTag\n  * Apple M1\n  * App stores\n  * cookies\n  * iCloud\n  * iMac\n  * iPad\n  * iPod\n  * iTunes\n  * Mac\n  * MacBook\n  * Privacy Sandbox\n  * Safari\n  * Siri\n  * Tim Cook\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Operating System\n  * Smartphone\n  * Steve Jobs\n  * Steve Wozniak\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Apple iPhone AI to be powered by Baidu in China, maybe\n\nOf course it's called ERNIE seeing as Google has BERT\n\nPersonal Tech16 days | 13\n\n#### Apple fans deluged with phony password reset requests\n\nBeware support calls offering a fix\n\nSecurity11 days | 18\n\n#### Apple cuts hundreds of jobs after ditching the car project and more\n\nSelf-driving to the nearest job center\n\nPersonal Tech2 days | 11\n\n#### A different view from the edge\n\nHow Dell NativeEdge provides the single pane of glass which harmonizes your IT\nand OT perspective\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### Apple's GoFetch silicon security fail was down to an obsession with speed\n\nOpinion Ye cannae change the laws of physics, but you can change your mind\n\nSecurity5 days | 23\n\n#### TSMC's 3nm node powers up, setting stage for tech giants' next-gen chips\n\nAMD, Apple, Intel throw weight \u2013 and cash \u2013 behind process technology\n\nSystems11 days | 3\n\n#### Google will delete data collected from 'private' browsing\n\nDeclares victory in settlement of class action lawsuit, but individual claims\nremain possible\n\nPersonal Tech6 days | 30\n\n#### Uncle Sam, 15 US states launch antitrust war on Apple\n\nLawsuit alleges iGiant rips off fans, stifles dev innovation, makes it tough\nto dump iOS for rivals\n\nOSes17 days | 40\n\n#### No joke: FTC boss goes on the Daily Show and is told Apple tried to block\nher\n\nComment Land of the Free has lost its way in quest for profits\n\nOffbeat5 days | 66\n\n#### Ex-White House CIO tells The Reg: TikTok ban may be diplomatic disaster\n\nInterview Theresa Payton on why US needs a national privacy law\n\nPublic Sector6 days | 63\n\n#### Meta, Microsoft, X, Match pledge selves to Epic battle against Apple App\nStore\n\nYou have my sword ... and my bow ... and my axe!\n\nApplications17 days | 14\n\n#### Woz calls out US lawmakers for TikTok ban: 'I don\u2019t like the hypocrisy'\n\nGo look at Facebook and Google, says Mac man\n\nPersonal Tech13 days | 66\n\nThe Register Biting the hand that feeds IT\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Contact us\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Who we are\n\n#### Our Websites\n\n  * The Next Platform\n  * DevClass\n  * Blocks and Files\n\n#### Your Privacy\n\n  * Cookies Policy\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Ts & Cs\n\nCopyright.
