I had\nno idea what people would want, so the copywriting was pretty simple:\n\nI added a card to my pricing page with the content: \"Have needs that don't\nneatly fit into our plans? I can help.\", with a call-to-action of \"Let's\ntalk\".\n\nA few people have reached out, I had a quick chat with some folks to learn\nwhat they were looking for in an enterprise version of OnlineOrNot (nothing\nsalesy on my end - I just wanted to learn), and I got absolutely slapped down\nby their requirements. OnlineOrNot fulfilled maybe half of what was being\nasked.\n\nOne particularly helpful person (that I'm eternally grateful for) walked me\nthrough their procurement spreadsheet, as well as letting me know what similar\nsolutions are charging, along with the \"must-have\", \"should-have\", \"nice-to-\nhave\" status of each feature, so I now have more information about what\ncustomers expect from OnlineOrNot than ever before. I'm particularly excited\nfor the roadmap.\n\n## I should've done that years ago\n\nI left those quick demo meetings feeling amazing, like I knew exactly what\ncustomers expected, and I'd be able to build those features pretty quickly\ntoo. At the same time, I was wondering \"why on earth didn't I do that\nsooner?!\" - the answer is simple:\n\nI wasn't ready.\n\nFor those of you that don't know me in real life, I'm a massive introvert.\nUnless we've already talked in real life, I'll probably have a notebook of\nthings to talk about if we end up doing a phone call together.\n\nThese demo calls were nothing like that. I just showed up to the call, and\nasked \"Hey, how can I make the next 20 minutes useful?\", and chatted about\nwhat their business does, what kind of monitoring needs they have, and how\nthey want to display their uptime to their customers.\n\nFrankly, I'm surprised I pulled it off, but I guess when you think about\nuptime monitoring for at least two hours a day for three years like I have, it\nstarts to become natural, and you don't need a notebook of questions to keep\nthe conversation going.\n\n## How giving up \"sugar-surge marketing\" is going\n\nAs I wrote in the previous diary, I'm no longer playing engagement games on\nTwitter, and writing articles solely so they rank on Hacker News.\n\nIt's not like I'm not good at it - I've written articles that reached #1 on\nHacker News several times now. I'm not going to lie, it feels AMAZING when it\nhappens. 40k+ people on your site, discussing your product, potentially\nsending business your way.\n\nThe trouble is, most of that traffic is irrelevant at best, distracting and a\nwaste of time at worst. Hacker News are not your customers. Maybe 0.01% of\nthem kinda-sorta fit your Ideal Customer Profile, but you now have to work out\nif a helpful-looking comment fits the profile of the type of customer you want\nto serve.\n\nSo instead, I've been writing helpful content for software teams. Traffic is\ndown, way down. Sign-ups are surprisingly stable, and conversions from trial-\nto-paid are increasing.\n\nNow, customer feedback comes directly to me via email, and I can immediately\nsee in their email signature that they're title X at software company Y, and\nthat the thing they're asking for will likely make OnlineOrNot better for\nfolks like them.\n\n### A quick rant on engagement games\n\nSomewhat related to sugar-surge marketing: asking extremely basic questions\nfor the sake of generating engagement does not do anything for your business,\nunless you're in the business of selling \"how to quit your job and make 500k!\"\ncourses for $500 a pop.\n\nYou might get some new followers out of it, but these are not the people\nthat'll stay on your mailing list for years. Folks that stick around, get\nvalue from what you're building, and give you feedback as you build do not\ncome from engagement games.\n\nrssMastodonTwitterGitHub\n\n\u00a9 2024 rozenmd.
