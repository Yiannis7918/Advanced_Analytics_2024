Our use case is a collective of fans aiming to promote\n> the visibility of an artist by strategically placing one of their songs in\n> the existing playlists they control. The success of the collective is\n> measured by the increase in test-time recommendations of the targeted song.\n> We introduce two easily implementable strategies towards this goal and test\n> their efficacy on a publicly available recommender system model released by\n> a major music streaming platform. Our findings reveal that even small\n> collectives (controlling less than 0.01% of the training data) can achieve\n> up 25x amplification of recommendations by strategically choosing the\n> position at which to insert the song. We then focus on investigating the\n> externalities of the strategy. We find that the performance loss for the\n> platform is negligible, and the recommendations of other songs are largely\n> preserved, minimally impairing the user experience of participants.\n> Moreover, the costs are evenly distributed among other artists. Taken\n> together, our findings demonstrate how collective action strategies can be\n> effective while not necessarily being adversarial, raising new questions\n> around incentives, social dynamics, and equilibria in recommender systems.\n\nSubjects:| Information Retrieval (cs.IR); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Social and\nInformation Networks (cs.SI)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.04269 [cs.IR]  \n(or arXiv:2404.04269v1 [cs.IR] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.04269arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Joachim Baumann [view email] [v1] Tue, 19 Mar 2024 23:27:15 UTC (4,598\nKB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Algorithmic Collective Action in Recommender\nSystems: Promoting Songs by Reordering Playlists, by Joachim Baumann and\nCelestine Mendler-D\\\"unner\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.IR\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.LG cs.SI\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
