Apologies for having so many of these so close together,\nbut the recent car troubles I\u2019ve had have eaten into my time quite a lot. At\nthe same time I am getting ready for the annual Society for Military History\nconference coming at the end of next week. In an effort to make a virtue of\nnecessity then, I\u2019ll muse a bit on the topic of the roundtable at SMH that I\nam moderating, \u201cWarfighting other than Battle in the Late Classical and\nHellenistic World.\u201d\n\nWe seem to have gotten more Percy pictures lately, so here is Ollie resting a\nbit after a hard day\u2019s worth of resting a bit, but he moves on to his arduous\npost-nap nap.\n\nI was actually brought in somewhat late to fill in as moderator for the panel\nso I didn\u2019t have a choice in the title, but I actually think the title is very\nwell and carefully chosen. There is a tendency to talk about these kinds of\nnon-battle military actions as \u2018irregular\u2019 or \u2018unconventional\u2019 in some way,\nand I think this is actually a mistake in essentially any period, but\nespecially for pre-modern armies.\n\nOf course the first problem is one of framing. To imply certain kinds of\nwarfare (generally warfare focused on raiding, ambushes or popular resistance\nto imperial authority) are \u2018irregular\u2019 or \u2018unconventional\u2019 is to set out an\nunexamined assumption that the other kind of warfare \u2013 large armies meeting in\npitched battles or sieges \u2013 is \u2018regular\u2019 or \u2018conventional\u2019 which is to say\nnormal or typical. But in fact \u2018unconventional\u2019 warfare, as we discussed with\nmy loose concept of the \u2018First System of War\u2018 is the oldest form of warfare,\nthe oldest convention, as it were.^1 Instead, historically speaking it is the\nbattles-and-sieges agrarian system (what I\u2019ve termed the \u2018Second System\u2019)\nwhich is the newer one.\n\nBut even within \u2018second system\u2019 armies \u2013 the armies of, say, Alexander or the\nRomans \u2013 soldiers are doing a lot of \u2018warfighting\u2019 that resembles, when it\nisn\u2019t identical to, supposed \u2018unconventional\u2019 or \u2018guerrila\u2019 warfare. We\nimagine raiding and cattle rustling to be the kind thing done by bandits or by\nunsophisticated non-state \u2018tribal\u2019 peoples (and they do do that!) but this was\nalso a core part of how supposedly more sophisticated large \u2018conventional\u2019\nstate armies worked! A big \u2018conventional\u2019 Roman army, moving through enemy\nterritory would be raiding the villages and towns it moved through, stealing\nforaging food from the locals, grabbing moveable wealth and also, of course,\nabducting and enslaving people.\n\nLikewise, it isn\u2019t like big armies don\u2019t try to surprise or ambush each other,\nbut rather than very large armies struggle to surprise each other and well\ncommanded, which is to say surrounded by a cloud of scouts, they are also hard\nto surprise. Though they can surprise civilians in villages, which loops right\nback in to the point about foraging. Finally, \u2018policing\u2019 actions in antiquity\nare also often not very different from banditry. While sometimes troops\ndeployed this way are enforcing laws more broadly as we\u2019d understand them,\ngenerally their primary purpose is to assure the regular collection of tribute\nand to employ violence \u2013 or at least the threat of violence \u2013 to make sure it\ngets collected.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say there\u2019s no difference. Roman armies do not seek to conceal\nthemselves in the civilian population, for instance and the taking and holding\nof territory is a meaningful difference as well. But rather that we\u2019re not\nlooking at a \u2018bright line\u2019 between what big state armies do in battles and\nsieges and what smaller forces do in raids, ambushes, banditry or resistance.\nIt\u2019s a continuum of grey.\n\nAnd that problem is made harder by a consistent rhetoric turn in a lot of our\nsources, which of course tend to be written by the literate, wealthy\nadministrators of these big empires: the rhetorical turn to represent any\nresistance or opposition for anything that isn\u2019t a peer big empire as just\n\u2018banditry\u2019 (e.g. Latin, latrocinium). You can see the propaganda value of this\nas such a label inherently delegitimizes what might be popular movements by\nre-classifying something like resistance simply as \u2018crime\u2019 (though we should\nbe quick to note that there was plenty of actual banditry in antiquity as\nwell!). But I think it was also often a sincere (but motivated) position for\nmilitary aristocrats who wanted to separate the thing they did \u2013 honorably\nwield violence on behalf of the state \u2013 from the thing others did \u2013\ndishonorable wield violence without the sanction of the state. That said, our\naristocratic sources are also perfectly happy to classify local resistance as\n\u2018banditry\u2019 too, even when the targets of this \u2018banditry\u2019 are traditional\nmilitary targets in warfare in this period, like raids against forts or\ngarrisons, or violence against state officials like tax collectors, or efforts\nto seize population centers.\n\nThat said, this tendency to reduce almost any form of non-state violence (or\nof non-recognized state violence) to \u2018banditry\u2019 can have adverse impacts on\nour understanding of warfare. A good example of this is in how generations of\nscholars have regarded Roman fighting in Spain. For a long time, the native\nSpaniards (Iberians, Celtiberians, Lusitanians, etc. etc.) were often regarded\nas \u2018irregulars\u2019 or \u2018guerrilas\u2019 in part because our sources keep calling them\nbandits and in part, I suspect, from the long shadow that actual Spanish\nguerillas fighting Napoleon in the Peninsular War (1807-1814) cast. Scholars\nlooked at these \u2018bandits\u2019 in their sources and said, \u201cah yes, the venerable\n\u2018Spanish guerilla\u2019 from antiquity to today.\u201d\n\nExcept \u2013 as Fernando Quesada Sanz has been pointing out now in his lonely\ncrusade for roughly two decades \u2013 these \u2018guerilla\u2019 armies of \u2018bandits\u2019 in fact\noften fought in pitched battles! When they fight the Romans, they aren\u2019t\nusually skirmishing or ambushing, but forming into main battle lines or\nresisting the Romans in sieges (like that at Numantia, famously). Absolutely,\nthese armies also engage in raiding, but so do the Romans and one man\u2019s raid\nis another\u2019s \u2018foraging operation.\u2019\n\nFinally, much of the time \u2018warfighting other than battle\u2019 flies quite under\nthe radar in our sources. We catch glimpses of some of this low-level violence\nin our sources when things \u2018blow up\u2019 in a region or when, by some accident of\npreservation, we have local records (mostly this happens in Egypt). What we\nsee is actually quite a fair bit of low-level violence as part of the\n\u2018maintenance\u2019 of empire: taxes and tribute were generally not popular and so\nforce might be required. That might produce resistance, including armed\nresistance, which in turn produced a lot of low-level fighting which was\nnevertheless important for the continued function of the larger imperial\nstate. The impression one gets is that the Romans achieve a bit more\ncompliance than most ancient empires, but only a bit. I\u2019ve recommended it\nbefore, but if you want to get a sense of the kind of regular use of force the\nRomans required to administer their empire \u2013 even in the minimal, generally\nindirect way they did so in the early empire \u2013 the book to read is C. J.\nFuhrmann\u2019s Policing the Roman Empire: Soldiers, Administration and Public\nOrder (2012).\n\nOn to Recommendations:\n\nThe latest Pasts Imperfect has an interesting short essay by Tim Whitmarsh\nmusing on the complexity of authorship in the context of Candida Moss\u2019 God\u2019s\nGhostwriters (which I have not read) on the likely role of enslaved scribes in\nthe production of classical texts, particularly the Bible. The issue also\nnotes \u2013 and this is well worth relating \u2013 that the Getty has made some 88,000\nimages downloadable under a Creative Commons license (CC0, in fact). Included\nin the Getty\u2019s collection and the new image release are some notable ancient\nartifacts. Of particular interest to me is the decorated bronze shield-cover\ngenerally known as the \u2018Shield of Pharnakes,\u2019 as its inscription declares it\nto belong to King Pharnakes, which would be Pharnakes I of Pontus (r. c.\n190-155).\n\nAlso on the Classics front, Peopling the Past had a fascinating blog-essay a\ncouple of months back (which I have only now gotten around to) by Melissa\nFunke on trying to put together the life and legacy of the famous hetaira (as\nFunke defines it, \u201can upscale female sex worker\u201d which is, I think, sometimes\na clearer definition than \u2018courtesan,\u2019 a word that few use today and many\nstudents will not be able to parse the precise meaning of) of Athens, Phryne.\nIn particular, Funke \u2013 whose book on the topic, recently out, I have not yet\nhad a chance to read \u2013 I think brings out really well the contrast between the\nalmost legendary Phryne of the literary tradition on the one hand and the\nmarginal, sometimes perilous legal and social conditions under which she would\nhave worked, where hetaira, generally being metics, lacked the protections\ncitizen women would have.\n\nIn a more military-history focused vein, Alexander Burns posted on Twitter\nsome of his thoughts on, as he puts it, \u201chis students who are \u201cinto\u201d military\nhistory\u201d (Burns teaches at Franciscan University of Steubenville). I think his\nassessment of the basic stages of knowledge, moving from \u2018paradigm invocation\u2019\n(the \u2018received opinion\u2018 buttressed with lots of standard facts) to \u2018paradigm\nrejection\u2019 (having seen the received opinion critiqued, it is rejected\nwholesale) to a more sophisticated social/cultural contextualization\n(\u2018actually, the rivet-count of a T-34 matters less than these other social\nfactors...\u2019) and finally a more mature \u2018measured appreciation\u2019 of the breadth\nof the field. I\u2019ve seen those same stages in my students too and there\u2019s\nnothing wrong with the stages of development, so long as one understands that\nyou are supposed to mature out of each.\n\nFor this week\u2019s book recommendation, I\u2019m going to recommend one of the books I\nleaned on for the last fireside on Roman values, C.A. Barton\u2019s Roman Honor:\nThe Fire in the Bones (2001). I studied under Barton as an undergraduate at\nthe University of Massachusetts at Amherst, but only looped back around to\nfully read her book on Roman honor during my Ph.D studies. This is a book\nabout Roman culture and the Roman worldview \u2013 or more correctly the way the\nRomans view themselves and more crucially their innermost selves. This is an\nimportant exercise for the student of history, because, as L.P. Hartley\nfamously put it, \u201cThe past is a foreign country; they do things differently\nthere.\u201d And so part of what the historian aims to do is not merely know what\nhappened, but in order to understand why it happened, to be able to get into\nthe minds of those people in the past, doing things differently. To put\nanother way: we must also understand the vibes. This is a book about some\nserious Roman vibes.\n\nThe focus of Barton\u2019s book, of course, is the Roman concept of honor and the\nwhole constellation of ideas and concepts that circle around it (virtus, pudor\nand so on). For Barton, the Roman lived for the discrimen or certamen \u2013 that\nmoment of testing and decision for which we have so many well-worn phrases\n(\u2018sorting the wheat from the chaff\u2019 \u2018separating the men and the boys\u2019 and so\non).^2 It is in that moment that the Roman is, in a sense, most alive,\npropelled forward by virtus, guided by the other virtues, to pass the test and\nthereby win honor.\n\nTwo things, I think, distinguish Barton\u2019s approach. The first is a focus on\nhow these ideas make Romans feel and act; the man of honor shines, he is\nfiery, he glows. He stands tall, while others defer to him. The man filled\nwith shame is the opposite. Understanding how real these ideas could be in\nRoman culture is in turn important for understanding how the Roman state \u2013\nrepublic and empire \u2013 works, because it is predicated on those values, on the\nassumption that those not yet tested defer to those with honos who have been\nso tested and have shown their virtus. Second, the way Barton engages with the\nsources leaves a strong impression: the reader is bombarded with quotations\n(translated in the text, original in the footnotes) where the Romans can speak\nthemselves about their values. And goodness do the Romans ever speak for\nthemselves \u2013 almost never one example but half a dozen or more.\n\nThat strength can also be a weakness: to get that many references, Barton has\nto cast a wide net, especially chronologically and it isn\u2019t unusual to see\ndifferent examples for a point covering centuries, for instance from Plautus\n(late 3rd cent. BC) to Seneca (mid-late 1st cent. AD) in the same paragraph.\nThat somewhat weakens the book\u2019s ability to address chronological change,\nthough Barton does work a bit of that chronology back in some of the later\nchapters. That said, Barton\u2019s conception remains rooted with the bulk of her\nsources in the Late Republic (c. 133-31 BC) and while she stretches beyond\nthis and notes some changes, this is fundamentally not a chronologically\nfocused work. On the upside, the book is printed with footnotes (often taking\nup half a page or more!) with both original text for the translations and\nother useful notes, so for the student a trip from Barton\u2019s prose to the\noriginal sources is quick and often quite fruitful.\n\nBarton\u2019s prose is very readable. As someone who sat in her classes, I can hear\nher lecture voice in the pages \u2013 she is well-known among the students as a\npassionate lecturer (now retired) who would shout and gesture, jump up and\ndown and even get a bit misty-eyed at the fall of the Gracchi. The passion, I\nthink, comes through in the book as well, to its benefit and that\u2019s important,\nbecause this is fundamentally about things the Romans themselves were\npassionate about. I will also note, I think this book combines well with J.E.\nLendon\u2019s Empire of Honor (somewhat harder to obtain) to give a the fullest\npicture of honor in Roman affairs. But for someone looking to understand how\nthe Romans thought about their own inner-lives and emotions, Roman Honor is, I\nthink, the place to start.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n\n  1. Though I should be clear, I intend my numbered \u2018systems of war\u2019 there as mostly teaching categories, rather than rigorous research categories. The basic models, I think, describe a lot of military activity, but the exceptions and edge cases are many and in any detailed study of any individual military system, the exceptions will often overwhelm the rules. Nevertheless it remains clearly true that \u2018unconventional\u2019 raid-and-ambush warfare was first.\n  2. One thing that\u2019s striking: whereas the Greek equivalent, the agon is a contest against another, the Roman discrimen is a test against any sort of challenge or hardship. Greek arete (\u2018excellence\u2019) tends to be comparative in nature: the best, the strongest, the fastest and so on, whereas the Roman equivalents are less inherently comparative. Virtus is not zero-sum. That doesn\u2019t mean the Romans aren\u2019t competitive, but it is, I think, a subtle but real difference in ethos (especially aristocratic ethos).\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n  * Tagged\n  * Ancient\n  * Fireside Chat\n  * First System Warfare\n  * Resistance\n  * Rome\n\n## Published by Bret Devereaux\n\nView all posts by Bret Devereaux\n\nPublished April 12, 2024\n\n## 75 thoughts on \u201cFireside Friday, April 12, 2024\u201d\n\n  1. Adam says:\n\nApril 12, 2024 at 11:49 am\n\nInteresting note, back when I was an undergrad taking poli-sci ages ago, when\nwe were talking about \u2018conventional\u2019 vs irregular military conflicts, the\ndefining line was often considered whether or not the attempt to effect\npolitical change was controlling or coercive. I.E., both the Anglo-Zanzibar\nwar and the Eastern Front of WW2 were conventional conflicts because they\nattempted to effect political change by moving in and altering the status quo\non the ground; no amount of will absent means could have prolonged the\nconflict. Irregular wars, on the other hand, are characterized by one or both\nsides attempting to raise the costs of the conflicts to the point that the\nother side decides to back down rather than continuing, even if they had the\nmeans to continue.\n\nNow, this was very explicitly about modern conflicts, but I wonder if that\nsort of construction is still used in analyses of modern conflicts, but also\nif that\u2019s even applicable to ancient ones. Ancient polities seem to be a lot\nmore politically unstable than modern ones, by and large, and the difference\nbetween \u201cWe could fight on, but the game isn\u2019t worth the candle\u201d and \u201cmuch\nmore comprehensive defeat and an inability to resist further\u201d don\u2019t seem to be\nas far apart, especially since bad battlefield defeats could and did collapse\nthe governing coalition.\n\nIt also makes my ability to understand a panel like this somewhat limited. How\nmuch a Roman army\u2019s operations resembles bandits or other unconventional\nactors matters less to me. If I were on this panel or asking it questions, I\nwould be more interested in how the Romans planned on drawing the line between\ntheir operations, including pitched battle if it came to that, and asserting\ncontrol over the Iberian countryside to determine if this was a \u2018conventional\u2019\nconflict or not.\n\nLoading...\n\nReply\n\n    1. Philip Koop says:\n\nApril 12, 2024 at 3:28 pm\n\nThat\u2019s interesting, because Clausewitz (drink!) did draw a distinction on this\nbasis. What you call regular and irregular he might have called theoretical\nand real:\n\n\u201cBut this object of War in the abstract, this final means of attaining the\npolitical object in which all others are combined, the DISARMING THE ENEMY, is\nrarely attained in practice and is not a condition necessary to peace.\nTherefore it can in no wise be set up in theory as a law. There are\ninnumerable instances of treaties in which peace has been settled before\neither party could be looked upon as disarmed; indeed, even before the balance\nof power had undergone any sensible alteration. Nay, further, if we look at\nthe case in the concrete, then we must say that in a whole class of cases, the\nidea of a complete defeat of the enemy would be a mere imaginative flight,\nespecially when the enemy is considerably superior. The reason why the object\ndeduced from the conception of War is not adapted in general to real War lies\nin the difference between the two, which is discussed in the preceding\nchapter. If it was as pure theory gives it, then a War between two States of\nvery unequal military strength would appear an absurdity; therefore\nimpossible. At most, the inequality between the physical forces might be such\nthat it could be balanced by the moral forces, and that would not go far with\nour present social condition in Europe. Therefore, if we have seen Wars take\nplace between States of very unequal power, that has been the case because\nthere is a wide difference between War in reality and its original conception.\nThere are two considerations which as motives may practically take the place\nof inability to continue the contest. The first is the improbability, the\nsecond is the excessive price, of success.\u201d\n\nLoading...\n\nReply\n\n      1.

E.g.\nas I understand there is no consensus among historians about Spartacus\u2019 long-\nterm goals. If you say he was not a bandit because he at least had the further\ngoal of \u201cescape slavery\u201d, does that mean any group made up of escaped slaves\nare definitionally not bandits? Taking it a step further, there may be many\ncases where we can\u2019t positively identify a group of alleged bandits as escaped\nslaves, but in how many of those cases can we positively determine they\n*weren\u2019t* escaped slaves?\n\nI don\u2019t think these concerns are entirely hypothetical, given that in more\nrecent history where we have better documentation it is very common for groups\nmany would classify as bandits claiming to fight for some cause or other, e.g.\npost ACW bandits claiming to be carrying the torch of the confederacy, or more\nexamples claiming to espouse Marxism, Islamic fundamentalism, etc. The fact\nthat those groups are better documented also lets us have debates about their\nsincerity, but by the same token sincerity is hard to assess in an ancient\nRoman context!\n\nLoading...\n\nReply\n\n        1.

Have talked with a professional historian\non r/AskHistorians where they were openly contemptuous of technical details\nsaying, to paraphrase, \u201camateurs get hung up on the technical details but we\nprofessionals have more serious things to worry about\u201d which just left me a\nbit gobsmacked (kind of like the psychologist who told me that a lot of people\nin the field still take Jung seriously, I thought his ideas were seriously\noutdated...). I can understand your eyes glazing over a bit when obsessives go\non endlessly about all of the slightly different versions of WW II firearms or\nwhat have you but I agree strongly that the kind of grounding you\u2019re talking\nabout is essential. You get historians who seem to think textual analysis is\nthe end all and be all of the field which just makes my brain hurt.\n\nLoading...\n\nReply\n\n        1.

Personally my eyes just glaze over when\npeople start going on about WW II weapon stats (except for really exceptional\nthings like the horrible initial design of American torpedoes in WW II). But\nif you\u2019re a professional historian you really should know what they\u2019re talking\nabout so you can avoid falling down the same rabbit holes yourself and to be\nable to put those metrics into the proper context.\n\nThe stuff I\u2019ve noticed with historians goofing about details of beer\nproduction isn\u2019t not caring about metrics, it\u2019s more not knowing what makes\ntank cannons go boom. Really surface level stuff you could get off of\nWikipedia articles.\n\nNot all historians are like this of course. I listen to a lot of history\npodcasts and I came across one interview where the historian was talking about\ntracing where in neolithic China people used malted vs. unmalted grains to\nmake alcohol by analyzing residue on pot shards, which was fascinating (she\nseemed to really know her shit) but a depressing number of historians...just\ndon\u2019t seem to bother learning even the basics of the technical details of the\nstuff they\u2019re analyzing the socio-economic implications of.\n\nLoading...\n\n  18.
