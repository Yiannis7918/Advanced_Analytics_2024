What you gain is transparency, control over resources,\nprivacy etc etc; what you lose, to a quite significant degree, is power and\ncomplexity.\n\nI used llamafile from Mozilla, a programme which lets you download small LLMs\n(filesizes are around 1GB) and tried out two very lightweight models, at the\nabsolute maximum of what I can run on my wheezy secondhand laptop. With very\nlittle RAM and no GPU, they can only output a few tokens (~words) a minute, so\nthe process was quite painful. Furthermore, neither were capable of designing\na chair.\n\nThe above are my attempts to sketch out designs for scrap wood chairs based on\nthe instructions from two locally-running LLMs: LLAVA 1.5 and Phi-2 (click\nthose links for full transcripts of our conversations). While I tried to makes\nsense of what I was given, the above sketches are very creative\ninterpretations of instructions which mostly did not make sense. Confusion\nover materials, inconsistent referents, and severe difficulties with\nmeasurements, resulted in descriptions which sounded like they should make a\nchair, but really didn\u2019t.\n\nI don\u2019t know how much of this I can blame on the models, or the fact that they\nwere running on a seriously underpowered machine. But I decided if I was going\nto use up my remaining stock of scrap wood, I would work with a slightly more\nhelpful assistant, so I turned to the ChatGPT competitor, Mistral.\n\n> I have a pile of scrap wood and I would like to make a chair.

Please note that the design will be basic due to the limited materials\n> and tools. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide: Materials: \u2022 Pine panels: A (18,\n> 180, 490 mm), B (18, 255, 490 mm), C (18, 255, 490 mm) \u2022 Plywood sheet: D\n> (4, 480, 455 mm) \u2022 L-shaped laminated chipboard sheet: E (15, 280, 410 mm) \u2022\n> Planks: F (20, 95, 1300 mm), G (20, 95, 1200 mm), H (20, 95, 1200 mm) \u2022 Wood\n> beam: I (50, 50, 895 mm) Tools: \u2022 Saw \u2022 Drill \u2022 Screws \u2022 Wood glue Steps: 1.\n> Backrest and Seat: \u2013 Use pine panel A (18, 180, 490 mm) as the backrest. \u2013\n> Use the plywood sheet D (4, 480, 455 mm) as the seat. 2. Back Legs: \u2013 Cut\n> plank F (20, 95, 1300 mm) into two equal pieces (20, 95, 650 mm) for the\n> back legs. 3. Front Legs: \u2013 Use plank G (20, 95, 1200 mm) and cut it into\n> two equal pieces (20, 95, 600 mm) for the front legs. 4. Armrests: \u2013 Use\n> plank H (20, 95, 1200 mm) for the armrests. Cut it into two pieces, one of\n> 20, 95, 500 mm and the other of 20, 95, 700 mm. The longer piece will be the\n> back armrest, and the shorter one will be the front armrest. 5. Support\n> Beam: \u2013 Use the wood beam I (50, 50, 895 mm) as a support beam between the\n> front legs. 6. Assembly: \u2013 Attach the backrest (A) to the top of the back\n> legs. \u2013 Attach the seat (D) to the top of the front legs and the bottom of\n> the back legs. \u2013 Attach the back armrest to the top of the backrest and the\n> back legs. \u2013 Attach the front armrest to the front legs. \u2013 Attach the\n> support beam (I) between the front legs for added stability. \u2013 Use the\n> L-shaped laminated chipboard sheet (E) as additional support. Attach it to\n> the back of the seat and the backrest. Remember to pre-drill all your holes\n> to prevent the wood from splitting. Also, use wood glue in addition to\n> screws for extra strength.

Good luck\n> with your project!\n\nThis seemed like a pretty do-able set of instructions, although I had doubts\nabout some of the aspects, so I went ahead and built it. There was a bit more\nback-and-forth about how to attach the seat (the above makes no sense), the\nseat\u2019s orientation, and various connections. Read the full transcript here.\nMistral is very apologetic, but I\u2019d also been told it was more technically\naccurate than ChatGPT and less likely to make stuff up, so let\u2019s go.\n\nThere were two major changes to Mistral\u2019s first design, one of which I\nprompted directly, and the other I did without discussing it. The first is\nthat it was very obvious that the seat as described had no way of attaching to\nthe legs, and there was no way of adapting the design as given without using\nmore wood. Challenged on this, Mistral advised adding cleats to the back legs\nto support the chair. I interpreted this in the way you see in the chair:\nadding additional blocks to the legs to widen them and provide a secure base\nfor the seat. I did this to the front legs too, which Mistral didn\u2019t ask for,\nbut was very obviously necessary (and still insufficient; see below). As an\naside, this produced a detail which I absolutely love, where the rear of the\nseat is very neatly sandwiched between the rear leg cleats and the backrest.\n\nSecondly, Mistral suggested armrests, but it was very unclear where these went\nor how they were attached. As the original instructions included bracing\nbetween the front legs, but left the front-back axis supported only by the 4mm\nply seat (again: no), I decided to use these pieces as semi-armrests, semi-\nbraces, as you see in the final design. I like this: a design element I would\nnot have come up with without having to solve a structural problem posed by,\nand constrained by, my collaborator\u2019s instructions.\n\nMistral advised me to use the incredibly thin plywood sheet as a seat again,\njust as ChatGPT did. However, in this case it over-reached. It said the seat\nshould \u201coverhang the front legs slightly\u201d, which when combined with the other\nmeasurements it provided, resulted in the above. This cracked as soon as I sat\non it. To prevent this crack getting a lot worse, I had to add an additional\nbeam support underneath the seat \u2013 although this actually worked really well,\nboth aesthetically as it connected the armrests nicely, and structurally to\nstabilise the chair.\n\n(A reminder when looking at these photos: I am building these chairs quickly,\nwith very poor tools, out of materials which have been sitting in the rain and\nsun for months/years. Do not judge my joinery.)\n\nHere\u2019s the other major problem with the design as given:\n\nI am 6\u20190 (182cm) tall, but even my feet don\u2019t touch the ground. Now, the\nChatGPT chair was weirdly large, but kind of comfortingly so, like an outsized\nchild\u2019s chair. Mistral went even bigger, specifying legs which are 60cm long.\nThis is too long.\n\nOf course, I could see this coming, and in a true collaboration I would have\nsimply adjusted the height, and I nearly did this. But since I am still in the\nprototyping phase, I decided to let it stand, as it makes for a good point of\ncomparison with other collaborators, for now. As I said, Mistral was supposed\nto be more technically precise, and concise, than ChatGPT, but from this\nexperience it seems slightly less capable with materials and human dimensions.\nThe various changes prompted or needed \u2013 adding cleats, shortening the legs \u2013\nalso made for much less efficient use of materials than the first pass.\n\nOn the other hand, apart from the material efficiency issue (which does\nmatter), those adaptations are my job: Mistral made a way more interesting\nchair. The inclusion of armrests-turned-braces and the low backrest led to\nsomething that\u2019s much closer to a \u2018designer\u2019 chair than ChatGPT\u2019s oversized\ndoll\u2019s chair, even in this very rough prototype version.\n\nFinally, for comparison, here\u2019s where we are now: from left to right, the\nFR\u00d6SVI folding chair by IKEA, the AI Chair 1.0 by ChatGPT and me, and the AI\n(High?) Chair 1.1 by Mistral and me:\n\nAm I annoyed that I started making chairs, rather than simpler, elongated\nstools, so that I could have made a BENCHMARKING joke? Yes I am. But if any\nother AI developers want to give me access to their paid / geo-locked products\n(Anthropic, I\u2019m looking at you there), I\u2019d be happy to discuss BENCHMARKING\nyour product too.\n\n(Go read the history of benchmarks now. It has nothing to do with furniture,\nbut it\u2019s very nice.)\n\nComments are closed.
