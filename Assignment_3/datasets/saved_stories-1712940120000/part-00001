Specifically, I\ndidn\u2019t want something which replaced me, or the interesting bits of work, but\nsomething more like a smart carpenter\u2019s mate, to do some of the sums and make\ninteresting suggestions, and leave me to do the fiddling and the sanding. A\ncollaborator, not a god.\n\nHere is the wood that was knocking around on my balcony, left over from a few\nthings:\n\nAnd here is the prompt I gave OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT 4:\n\n> I have a pile of scrap wood and I would like to make a chair. I have a saw,\n> a drill, screws, and wood glue.\n>\n> Please give me step by step instructions for making a chair from the\n> following materials, using as little wood as possible.\n>\n> 4 pine panels:\n>\n>   * 18, 180, 490 mm\n>   * 18, 255, 490 mm\n>   * 18, 255, 490 mm\n>   * 18, 255, 490 mm\n>\n\n>\n> 1 plywood sheet:\n>\n>   * 4, 480, 850 mm\n>\n\n>\n> 1 L-shaped laminated chipboard sheet:\n>\n>   * 15, 280, 410 mm missing 130, 135 mm cutout\n>\n\n>\n> 1 20mm diameter dowel, 1900 mm long\n>\n> 1 pine or fir plank\n>\n>   * 20, 95, 1300 mm\n>\n\n>\n> 5 wood beams\n>\n>   * 50, 50, 890 mm\n>   * 50, 50, 900 mm\n>   * 50, 50, 980 mm\n>   * 50, 50, 980 mm\n>   * 50, 50, 1030 mm\n>\n\nThere was a bit more to it than that: I had some issues formatting the prompt\nin a way that didn\u2019t crash the chat client, and we also went back and forth on\na backrest. I also tried to push for a more interesting design, in the way I\ndescribed in the original post, but this resulted in something I could not\nmake (materially and physically) \u2013 and wasn\u2019t very interesting either. You can\nread the whole transcript here.\n\nSo, this is what we settled on:\n\n> > Materials Needed:\n>>\n\n>>   * Plywood Sheet: For the seat.\n\n>>   * Pine Panels: For the backrest.\n\n>>   * Wood Beams: For legs and support structure.\n\n>>   * Dowel: For additional bracing.\n\n>>   * Tools: Saw, drill, screws, and wood glue.\n\n>>\n\n>>\n\n>> Cutting Plan:\n\n>>\n\n>>   1. Seat: Use the plywood sheet to cut a rectangular seat, 480 mm x 400\nmm.\n\n>>   2. Backrest: Select one pine panel (255 mm x 490 mm) and trim if\nnecessary to match the width of the seat for aesthetic continuity.\n\n>>   3. Legs/Support Structure:\n\n>>\n\n>>      * Front Legs: Cut two pieces from the beams to the desired seat height\n(about 450 mm).\n\n>>      * Rear Legs/Backrest Support: Use the longer beams (980 mm or 1030 mm)\nand cut them so they can serve both as rear legs and extend upward to support\nthe backrest. The total length should support a standard seat height plus the\nbackrest height, roughly 900-1000 mm depending on your desired backrest angle\nand height.\n\n>>   4. Seat Supports: Use leftover wood or the pine/fir plank to create\nsupport planks that run underneath the seat for added stability. Cut these to\nmatch the width of the seat (400 mm).\n\n>>\n\n>>\n\n>> Assembly:\n\n>>\n\n>>   1. Prepare the Seat: Attach the support planks to the underside of the\nplywood seat using wood glue and screws for extra stability. Space them evenly\nto distribute weight.\n\n>>   2. Attach Legs:\n\n>>\n\n>>      * Front Legs: Secure the front legs directly to the underside of the\nseat at its corners with screws and wood glue.\n\n>>      * Rear Legs/Backrest Support: Align the rear legs so they support the\nseat and extend up to support the backrest. Attach them to the underside of\nthe seat and the lower end of the backrest.\n\n>>   3. Install the Backrest: Attach the backrest to the extended rear legs\nusing screws and glue. Ensure it\u2019s firmly in place and offers comfortable\nsupport.\n\n>>   4. Bracing with Dowel: For additional lateral stability, use the dowel to\ncreate cross-braces between the legs. Cut the dowel into pieces that fit\nbetween the legs under the seat and halfway up the rear legs/backrest\nsupports.\n\n>>\n\n>>\n\n>> Finishing Touches:\n\n>>\n\n>>   * Sand the chair thoroughly to smooth out any rough edges and corners.\n\n>>   * Apply a finish of your choice to protect the wood and enhance its\nappearance.\n\n>>\n\n>>\n\n>> This approach makes efficient use of your materials while providing a\nsturdy, comfortable seat with a backrest. The extended rear legs contribute to\na streamlined, elegant design, and the under-seat supports ensure durability\nand weight distribution.\n\nBased on this description, I worked up a rough plan that made sense. I tried\nto be as literal as possible. I suspected that the dowel braces between the\nlegs would be necessary, and they very much were:\n\nThe chair did not take very long to build \u2013 even on a narrow balcony, in the\ndark \u2013 and I didn\u2019t try too hard to make it nice. My saw is not very good; I\nsanded things down a bit; I glued where necessary. I tried to interpret the\ninstructions as literally as possible. I decided where the screws and glue\nshould go (twelve screws). You can sit in the chair.\n\nMy first impression of the chair was that this is what you get when you ask\nsomeone who has read a lot about chairs, but has never sat in one, to design a\nchair, which is exactly what it is. To be fair, it did a pretty good job.\n\nMy main concern building it was that the plywood seat was much too thin. It\nstill feels very thin when you sit in it: it creaks and gives. But it holds \u2013\nso far \u2013 and it\u2019s perhaps more comfortable than a thicker, more rigid seat\nwould have been.\n\nIt is what I wanted in that regard: minimalist \u2013 in the sense of using the\nabsolute minimum of material \u2013 and it pushes at the boundaries of what I would\nhave done myself.\n\nMy go-to example of what I mean here is the Optometrist Algorithm, which I\nwrote about in New Dark Age. The Optometrist Algorithm was designed, by\nGoogle, to improve nuclear fusion experiments. It\u2019s an algorithm which works\nalongside human researchers, as a collaborator, serving to push their\nexploration of a problem space just a little bit further, or in novel\ndirections, than they would do alone.\n\nI would not have designed this seat: I would have used another piece of\nthicker wood. And this would probably have been less efficient. This is all\nthe wood I had left at the end (from the pieces which ChatGPT selected):\n\nThe one change I would make would be to cut that remaining bit of ply down and\nuse it to laminate the seat, doubling its thickness. Maybe.\n\nThe chair also felt too big. Here\u2019s a size comparison with an IKEA folding\nchair:\n\nThat\u2019s still not terribly clear, but it\u2019s much taller, and deeper, than most\nchairs I have (I doubted the dimensions so much I clarified, in the chat,\nwhich way round the seat should be). But, again, I\u2019m not sure I disagree. I\u2019m\n6\u20190, and it feels the right size \u2013 it makes me feel like a lot of chairs are\ntoo small for me. Plus, again: efficiency. It used all the wood. It does look\nvery big though. It looks a bit weird. A slightly uncanny chair.\n\nI\u2019m not including here the images that ChatGPT made to accompany the\ninstructions; you can see them in the transcript, but they\u2019re not very\nhelpful, and don\u2019t match the descriptions in a useful, technical way. They are\nstill the same sort of thing though: generic images of chairs, rather than\ngeneric descriptions of chairs.\n\nI\u2019m still a bit disappointed that other prompts which asked the programme to\ngo a bit crazier with its design didn\u2019t pan out. Perhaps a chair isn\u2019t the\nbest thing for playing with here: humanity has converged on pretty much the\nbest minimal chair design possible without AI\u2019s help, it\u2019s hard to improve on\nthat. But it\u2019s nice that after years of trying to peer inside the machine, I\nget to explore in more practical ways what comes out of it.\n\nIt should be noted that this chair is built on the stolen labour of everyone\nwho\u2019s ever put something on the internet (including many who passed centuries\nbefore the internet was invented). The energy use is not good. I didn\u2019t make\nthis with ChatGPT: I made it with a partial history of all previous chairs,\nand I held myself back from making it \u201cbetter\u201d. But it\u2019s something to think\nwith.\n\nI learned to make chairs from Enzo Mari, Donald Judd, my grandpa, YouTube.\nWhat the machine is good at is numbers, efficiency, tolerances (maybe). What\ncan we do with that which is more interesting than putting people out of work?\nWhich is more, genuinely, generative? Which is more interesting than more\ncomputers? Which, ultimately, builds agency rather than contributing to our\ngeneral disempowerment us? That, at least, is what I mean by collaboration. We\nlearn together.\n\nEdit 19/3/24: As a couple of people have pointed out, this feels like the\nopposite of generative AI. The machine can only use the tools and materials I\nhave to hand: it\u2019s restrictive, yet paradoxically more productive as a result.\nSomething to think about.\n\nComments are closed.
