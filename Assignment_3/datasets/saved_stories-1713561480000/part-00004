There was a lot of exciting news\nthis week. For the first time, SpaceX launched a reusable Falcon 9 booster for\na 20th flight. A few miles away at Cape Canaveral, Boeing and United Launch\nAlliance completed one of the final steps before the first crew launch of the\nStarliner spacecraft. But I think one of the most interesting things that\nhappened was NASA's decision to ask the space industry for more innovative\nideas on how to do Mars Sample Return. I have no doubt that space companies\nwill come up with some fascinating concepts, and I can't wait to hear about\nthem.\n\nAs always, we welcome reader submissions, and if you don't want to miss an\nissue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-\nenabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-,\nmedium-, and heavy-lift rockets, as well as a quick look ahead at the next\nthree launches on the calendar.\n\nGoing vertical Down Under. Gilmour Space has raised its privately developed\nEris rocket vertical on a launch pad in North Queensland for the first time,\nthe Australian Broadcasting Corporation reports. This milestone marks the\nstart of the next phase of launch preparations for Eris, a three-stage rocket\npowered by hybrid engines. If successful, Eris would become the first\nAustralian-built rocket to reach orbit. Gilmour says the maiden flight of Eris\nis scheduled for no earlier than May 4, pending launch permit approvals. This\npresumably refers to a commercial launch license from the Australian\ngovernment.\n\nA milestone for Australia... Rockets from the United States and the United\nKingdom have launched satellites from Australian soil before, but Gilmour aims\nto become the first to do this with an entirely homemade rocket. The Eris\nrocket is capable of hauling about 670 pounds (305 kilograms) into a Sun-\nsynchronous polar orbit. This puts Eris in the same class as other commercial\nsmall satellite launchers, such as Rocket Lab's Electron. While the commercial\noutlook for the Eris rocket might seem somewhat dubious, it could make history\nin Australia and provide that nation with its first indigenous orbital launch\ncapability.

Astrobotic is making a strategic move into\nthe defense sector with its Xogdor reusable rocket, designed to test payloads\nat the edge of space, Space News reports. Perhaps most famous for its\ncommercially developed lunar landers, Astrobotic also builds and tests small\nreusable rockets with vertical takeoff and vertical landing capability. These\nrockets were developed by Masten Space Systems, which filed for bankruptcy in\n2022. Astrobotic acquired Masten a couple of months later. The next rocket\ndeveloped by Astrobotic and Masten, named Xogdor, is scheduled to debut in\n2025. \"We think the opportunities to leverage a platform like this are\nextensive, and they haven\u2019t fully been explored,\" said Sean Bedford,\nAstrobotic's director of business development for propulsion systems.\n\nNew opportunities ... Masten, and now Astrobotic, has historically flown small\nreusable rockets at low altitudes in the atmosphere to test propulsion\ntechnology and navigation sensors for precision landings on Earth or other\nplanets. The liquid-fueled Xogdor will be a different animal, standing 27 feet\ntall and 3 feet in diameter. An upgraded version of Xodgor will have the\nability to fly to altitudes higher than 62 miles (100 kilometers), according\nto Astrobotic. The Xogdor is funded by a NASA contract, but Bedford said\nAstrobotic is looking for ways the rocket can support the US military, the\nMissile Defense Agency, and other defense organizations for hypersonic\nresearch testing and point-to-point transportation.

UK-based small launch developer Orbex\ngot another boost from Scotland\u2019s national bank and other investors as it\ngears up for its first orbital launch, though that mission still does not have\na set date, TechCrunch reports. Orbex said it received \u00a316.7 million ($20.8\nmillion) from six financial backers in an update to its Series C funding\nround, which closed in October 2022 at \u00a340.4 million ($50 million). Founded in\n2015, Orbex is a privately held company, so we don't have any insight into its\nfinancial situation, but this latest funding round should be enough to keep\nOrbex going while it prepares for the inaugural test flight of its Prime\nrocket, a two-stage, 62-foot-tall (19-meter) rocket designed to loft small\nsatellites into low-Earth orbit.\n\nTesting and launch now in sight? ... Orbex's Prime rocket has faced chronic\ndelays, and it's been a while since the company revealed any real schedule for\nthe first test flight from Scotland. In mid-2022, Orbex aimed to launch Prime\nin late 2022 or early 2023. When Orbex announced its fresh funding Thursday,\nthe company stated that \"testing and launch (are) now in its sights.\" The new\nfunding will help Orbex ramp up development of Prime and \"ensure full\nreadiness and scalability for its launch period.\" Whenever that is.

For the first time, SpaceX launched one\nof its reusable Falcon 9 boosters on its 20th mission with a flight to deliver\n23 more Starlink Internet satellites to orbit, Ars reports. The successful\nlaunch and landing April 12 broke a three-way tie in SpaceX's fleet for the\nmost-flown Falcon 9 rocket. Another launch later this month will also use a\nFalcon 9 booster making its 20th flight. Pretty much every day, SpaceX is\neither launching a rocket or rolling one out of the hangar to the launch pad.\nAt this pace, SpaceX is redefining what is routine in the space industry, but\nthe rapid-fire launch rate also means the company is continually breaking\nrecords, mostly its own.\n\nSix launches in eight days ... This was also the sixth launch of a Falcon 9\nrocket in a period of eight days, more flights than SpaceX's main US rival,\nUnited Launch Alliance, has launched in 17 months. The booster used on April\n12, tail number B1062, has now launched more than 550 spacecraft, mostly\nStarlinks, plus eight commercial astronauts on two crew missions. When SpaceX\ndebuted the latest version of its Falcon 9 rocket, the Falcon 9 Block 5,\nofficials said the reusable first stage could fly 10 times with minimal\nrefurbishment and perhaps additional flights with a more extensive overhaul.\nNow, SpaceX is certifying Falcon 9 boosters for 40 flights.\n\nRussia's space chief is dreaming big. Yuri Borisov, head of Roscosmos,\nrecently spoke at a Russian space museum about the country's future launch\nplans. Among the topics was Russia's next-generation Amur-CNG rocket, a\nreusable vehicle conceived as a competitor to SpaceX's Falcon 9. Borisov said\nthe Falcon 9 could be reused about 10 times, and then claimed the Amur-CNG\nwould be capable of much more, perhaps up to 100 flights per booster, Ars\nreports. The problem is the Amur-CNG is nothing more than a paper rocket at\nthis stage. When Russian officials first discussed the Amur rocket in 2020,\nits first flight was scheduled for 2026. Now, that has slipped to 2028 or\n2029. This is probably still an optimistic timeline, and if Amur ever flies,\nit will surely take even longer to recover and reuse the booster, not to\nmention getting to 100 flights.\n\nRussian bluster ... This clearly was a message intended to placate an audience\nthat must be wondering why SpaceX has launched more than three dozen rockets\nso far in 2024, whereas Russia has mustered just half a dozen. However,\nBorisov's claims fall well short of reality. Russia's once-vaunted launch\nindustry has been much in decline due to a combination of factors, including\nan aging fleet of rockets, a reduction in government investment, and the\ncountry's war in Ukraine driving away Western customers. So officials turn to\nbluster, and this is what we're seeing here.\n\nEverything is coming together for Starliner. Ground teams on Florida's Space\nCoast hoisted Boeing's Starliner spacecraft atop its United Launch Alliance\nAtlas V rocket this week, putting all the pieces in place for liftoff May 6\nwith two veteran NASA astronauts on a test flight to the International Space\nStation, Ars reports. This will be the first time astronauts fly on Boeing's\nStarliner crew capsule, following two test flights without crew members in\n2019 and 2022. The Starliner Crew Flight Test (CFT) will wrap up a decade and\na half of development and, if all goes well, will pave the way for operational\nStarliner missions to ferry crews to and from the space station.\n\nSafety scrutiny ... In parallel with final preparations of the rocket and\nspacecraft, NASA and Boeing managers are participating in several reviews this\nmonth to formally clear Starliner for its first flight with astronauts.\nMembers of NASA's Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) are sitting in on\nthese reviews. Congress set up the independent panel in 1968, shortly after\nthe deadly Apollo 1 fire, to advise NASA on safety matters. For years, ASAP\nmembers have tracked the technical problems that plagued the Starliner\nprogram, including software woes, valve corrosion, and most recently,\nflammable material inside the spacecraft and parachutes that didn't measure up\nto design specifications. \u201cNow that the launch date is nearly here ... we have\nstepped up our fact finding in line with NASA\u2019s prelaunch activity,\" said\nSusan Helms, a retired Air Force general, former astronaut, and current chair\nof the safety panel.\n\nLooking back at SpaceX's first sooty rocket. Ten years ago this week, when a\nFalcon 9 rocket took off from Florida, something strange happened.\nDramatically, as the rocket lifted off, a geyser of dirty water splashed\nupward alongside the vehicle, coating the rocket in grime. Eric Berger's\nreporting on the story of why this occurred is fascinating, particularly for\nreporters like me who covered the launch when it happened. Essentially, SpaceX\ncreatively solved a problem with a leaky liquid oxygen connection by trickling\nwater from the launch pad's fire suppression system over the oxidizer pipe.\nThe fluid inside was flowing at cryogenic temperatures, so the water quickly\nfroze to seal the leak. The water continued trickling over the liquid oxygen\npipe through the countdown, so by the time the Falcon 9 took off, tens of\nthousands of gallons of water had flowed into the launch pad's flame trench.\nWhen the rocket fired its engines, dirty water and steam erupted up the side\nof the booster like a Bellagio fountain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo harm, no foul ... This didn't cause any problem for the rocket, but\nBerger's story jogged my memory from covering this launch. This story is a\nwonderful illustration of how quick-thinking aerospace engineers can solve\nproblems on the fly. In this instance, thanks to this problem-solving, the\nsmall liquid oxygen leak on the launch pad didn't delay the mission to\nresupply the International Space Station. In many ways, this was an entirely\ndifferent era for SpaceX, which was still basically a startup in 2014. This\nwas just the ninth flight of a Falcon 9 rocket. Now, SpaceX has launched more\nthan 330 Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets and dominates the global launch\nindustry.\n\nFinal hotfire for Ariane 6's upper stage. ArianeGroup, builder of Europe's\nAriane rocket family, conducted the final hotfire test of the new Ariane 6\nrocket's upper stage in Germany. This hotfire test of the upper stage's Vinci\nengine was delayed from late last year, and its purpose was to gather data for\nfuture Ariane 6 missions beyond the rocket's inaugural flight planned for the\nmiddle of this year. While previous test-firings focused on demonstrating the\nupper stage's ability to operate under normal conditions with its cryogenic\nVinci engine, this hotfire test focused on operating the upper stage during\n\"off-nominal\" conditions.\n\nAPU ... A major objective of this recent upper stage hotfire test involved the\nAriane 6's Auxiliary Propulsion Unit (APU). The APU is a nifty little device\non the upper stage responsible for pressurizing the liquid hydrogen and liquid\noxygen propellant tanks, settling propellants before each ignition of the\nrestartable Vinci engine and generating small amounts of additional thrust on\ndemand. This thrust can allow the Ariane 6 rocket to more precisely inject\nsatellites into orbit, deploy clusters of payloads into slightly different\norbits, and deorbit the stage at the end of its mission. This final hotfire\ntest included three long APU boosts for a total duration of 66 minutes.\n(submitted by Ken the Bin and EllPeaTea)\n\nSpaceX could play a role in Mars Sample Return. NASA's $11 billion plan to\nrobotically bring rock samples from Mars back to Earth is too expensive and\nwill take too long, so officials are tasking government and private sector\nengineers to come up with a better plan, Ars reports. SpaceX's giant Starship,\ndesigned with Mars missions in mind, could be part of the solution for NASA to\nbring back samples from the red planet cheaper and sooner than the 2040\nschedule the agency laid out this week, according to Scientific American. NASA\nis encouraging companies to submit ideas using capabilities that are part of\nthe Artemis lunar program. Starship is under contract to be the human-rated\nlander for the first two Artemis crew missions to the Moon's surface.\n\nSomehow the solution ... \u201cThe only conclusion you can really draw from that is\nthey\u2019re hoping Starship somehow is the solution here,\" said Casey Dreier,\nsenior space policy adviser for the Planetary Society, in an article published\nby Scientific American. That could provide MSR (Mars Sample Return) with a\nwhopper of a solution. NASA is already funding Starship, the largest rocket in\nhistory, to the tune of billions of dollars to ferry astronauts to the lunar\nsurface\u2014but Starship also has the potential to launch immense payloads off\nother worlds and back to Earth. \u201cStarship has the potential to return serious\ntonnage from Mars within [about] 5 years,\u201d noted SpaceX CEO Elon Musk on X,\nformerly Twitter, on April 15 in response to NASA\u2019s MSR solicitation.\n\nULA has received two more BE-4 engines. Blue Origin has delivered both BE-4\nmain engines United Launch Alliance needs for the second flight of its Vulcan\nrocket later this year. The first engine was delivered in February, and ULA's\nCEO, Tory Bruno, posted an image on X this week showing the second BE-4 engine\nbeing installed on the Vulcan first stage at the company's factory in Alabama.\nBruno previously said the first two flightworthy BE-4 engines performed\nflawlessly on the first Vulcan mission in January but that the supply chain\nfor BE-4s remained in the critical path for ramping up Vulcan's flight rate to\na goal of two launches per month by the end of next year.\n\nFall launch ... ULA plans to launch the second test flight of Vulcan this\nfall, a few months later than hoped. The main driver to this schedule appears\nto be the readiness of Sierra Space's Dream Chaser spaceplane, which is\nundergoing environmental testing in Ohio before its delivery to Cape Canaveral\nfor launch preparations. Dream Chaser is designed to ferry cargo and\nexperiments to and from the International Space Station. If Dream Chaser isn't\nready this year, ULA will face a choice about what to do with the second\nVulcan launch. The Space Force is eager for ULA to launch the second Vulcan\nflight as soon as possible to get the rocket certified for national security\nmissions.\n\n## Next three launches\n\nApril 20: Long March 2D | Unknown Payload | Xichang Satellite Launch Center, China | 23:45 UTC\n\nApril 22: Falcon 9 | Starlink 6-53 | Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida | 22:40 UTC\n\nApril 23: Electron | NeonSat-1 and ACS3 | Mahia Peninsula, New Zealand | 21:30 UTC\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How The Callisto Protocol's Team Designed Its Terrifying, Immersive Audio\n\n#### reader comments\n\n59\n\nStephen Clark Stephen Clark is a space reporter at Ars Technica, covering\nprivate space companies and the world\u2019s space agencies.
