This took one of the days:\n\nThis is a screenshot of a working wallhack for classic Star Wars Battlefront\nII. I created it yesterday after getting carried away with reversing the game.\nIt was a fun puzzle, an intellectual challenge, made more interesting by the\nfact that I couldn\u2019t find any information about the internals of the game\nonline due to its old age. It turns out that everything is stored in huge\nglobal arrays, instead of there being a pointer to a to a dynamically\nallocated address which points to a dynamically allocated list of pointers\nthat each point to one dynamically allocated game entity.\n\nJoseph Bronski is a reader-supported publication.

These\nvideos feature totally obedient high IQ people doing complicated wholesome\nchungus 6,000,000 codesoy projects that make them feel very smart. And it\u2019s\nclear that this is the kind of thing they do; and recently it\u2019s what I\u2019ve been\ndoing.\n\nThis is very bad for humanity because instead of high IQ people collecting\ndata about the natural world, or, if smart enough, modeling said data, many\nhigh IQ people are coding block games \u201cfrom scratch\u201d numerous times to prove\nhow awesome their heckin computer skillz are. The programming matrix is a\nsimulated world full of stimulating puzzles smart people capable of furthering\nhuman knowledge can easily get addicted to. Computers are a type II IQ\nshredder.\n\nA type I IQ shredder was defined by Spandrell:\n\n> How many bright Indians and bright Chinese are there, Harry? Surely they are\n> not infinite. And what will they do in Singapore? Well, engage in the\n> finance and marketing rat-race and depress their fertility to 0.78, wasting\n> valuable genes just so your property prices don't go down. Singapore is an\n> IQ shredder.\n\nType I IQ shredders shred intelligence genes. They are very dangerous for the\nlong term because they decrease the overall intelligence of the next\ngeneration. Type II IQ shredders destroy intellectual output now by\ndistracting high IQ people from real pursuits, or via other means. Tlon is a\ngood example of a type II IQ shredder. If Tlon worship doesn\u2019t effect high IQ\nreproduction, then it is only a type II IQ shredder, because it grinds actual\nintellectual output to a halt by distracting everyone intelligent. Likewise,\nif everyone went to San Francisco or Singapore to improve human knowledge, but\nthey didn\u2019t reproduce due to housing prices, density, liberal culture, etc,\nthen San Francisco and Singapore would only be type I IQ shredders, because\nthey adequately use the intelligence they are given, but deprive it from the\nnext generation.\n\nIn reality, Singapore, San Francisco, et al. are both type I and type II IQ\nshredders, because not only do the people who go there suffer from reduced\nfertility \u2014 they also spend all day interacting with the intellectual Matrix,\nthe Tlon that are computers.\n\nWe know intellectual pursuits by their fruits. Some computer pursuits are not\nIQ shredders. The whole process of getting computer tech to where it is now\nwas not fruitless. It was an amazing feat of intellectual output. Most\nwebshit, \u201chacking\u201d the C++ compiler so you can save you game, and most\nprograms and codesoy projects in general now are just distractions. We know\nthis because their fruit is worthless distraction. A video game? How long did\nyou spend making it? Video games are virtual drugs. You\u2019re a drug dealer.\nCongratulations. A new webshit framework? Do we need that? A new memelang like\nGo or Rust or Kotlin? Do we need that? A new shitcoin? How long did you spend\non that? How smart do you feel? You feel very smart and 1337 despite doing\nnothing of value? You\u2019ve been had by the type II IQ shredder.\n\nJoseph Bronski is a reader-supported publication.
