In the past half-decade, their integration into core natural\n> language processing tools has dramatically increased the performance of such\n> tools, and they have entered the public discourse surrounding artificial\n> intelligence. Consequently, it is important for both developers and\n> researchers alike to understand the mathematical foundations of large\n> language models, as well as how to implement them. These notes are the\n> accompaniment to the theoretical portion of the ETH Z\u00fcrich course on large\n> language models, covering what constitutes a language model from a formal,\n> theoretical perspective.\n\nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2311.04329 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2311.04329v1 [cs.CL] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2311.04329arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Clara Meister [view email] [v1] Tue, 7 Nov 2023 20:21:42 UTC (2,924 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Formal Aspects of Language Modeling, by Ryan\nCotterell and 3 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2311\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
