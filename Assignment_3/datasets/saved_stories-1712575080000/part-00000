Milk was a\nsubscription service and that made a lot of sense, especially as the milkman\nalso sold eggs, bread and other staples. Unusually, where I live there is\nstill a milkman.\n\nThe bottles are made of glass. When they are empty they are rinsed and then\nleft out for the milkman to collect next time and so are reused. The only\n(recyclable) waste is the small foil cap. The milkman arrives in an special\nelectric van called a \"milk float\" so if you are into your environmentalism\nthen milk is the SaaS for you.\n\nAt some point though, milk became something your bought at the supermarket, in\na disposable plastic bottle that you put in \"the recycling\" but the plastic is\nmostly not in fact recycled at all but just moved around. This makes milk an\nunusual case of a service turning into a product to its detriment.\n\nMy teenage weekend and summer job was to be shelf-stacker in a \"big box\" shop.\nI specialised in printers and printer cartridges. Customers sometimes wanted\nto hear my advice but once they received my recommendation of a \u00a3100 mono\nlaser they never wanted to hear any more of it. Most of them bought the\ncheapest printer in the shop, a Lexmark model for less than \u00a330, clearly a\nscreaming deal. A huge fraction of them returned within the week to buy more\nink, for the cartridge that was bundled with the printer came only a third\nfull. When they saw that the refill cartridge for their new printer was nearly\n\u00a340 it often really did become a screaming deal.\n\nThe very last thing they wanted to hear about at that point was \"that bleeding\nmono laser again\". It would have been more rational to switch printer but sunk\ncost fallacy exerts a strong pull and the majority did buy the refill\ncartridge. That little Lexmark cartridge did excellent repeat business.\n\nThe secret of printers is that you aren't buying the printer but instead\nentering into a subscription for printer cartridges, which are often ruinous.\nBut that truth is obscure and printer manufacturers work hard to ensure it\nremains so.\n\n## The dreaded riddle of \"capex and opex\"\n\nThere are two ways to spend money on things. One is to buy something outright\nand then own it. Accountants call this capital expenditure (\"capex\") because\nyou're spending your company's share capital. It then ends up on your balance\nsheet, meaning you count it as something of value that your company owns.\n\nThe other way is to rent. Accountants call this operational expenditure\n(\"opex\") and instead of owning the thing forever you pay someone to give you\naccess to it for a while. Despite the printer example, it is important to\nunderstand that this is not necessarily worse and can often be a better deal.\n\nIf, as a company, you owned your own offices you would sink your company's\ncapital into commercial property in the town your company operates in. That\nwould be some capital no longer available to your core business. If your core\nbusiness has a return on equity of 20% then it's probably a better idea to use\nyour capital there rather than putting it into commercial property which makes\nonly about 7% a year (...in a good year).\n\n## Software, despite widespread pretence, is usually opex\n\nNot all capex vs opex decisions are so rational, or so clear. One of the great\nconceits of modern business is to pretend that you are investing capital when\nyou are really just cultivating a new stream of expenses. It's common for\npeople to say that they are \"investing in [such and such]\" or \"building an\nasset\" when really they are just allocating more budget for spending (ie:\nopex).\n\nWhat makes an asset, though? More terms from accountancy help. When an\naccountant values an asset in order to record it on the company balance sheet\nthey mark its value at historical cost or net realisable value - whichever is\nlower. Demonstrating \"net realisable value\" proves hard for many software\nprojects. It means you have to find a buyer.\n\nThat isn't someone who will buy licences (ie rent access) but someone who\nwould buy the thing outright and take it off you. Generating revenue does not\nmake something an asset - though if you can sell licences (profitably, after\ncosts!) that is a suggestion that there might be someone out there who would\nbuy it or that it could be spun out as a separate business.\n\nIn practice is it pretty exceptional for any software project to have a real\nprospective buyer. That new, \"big data\" warehouse platform probably won't have\nany ready buyers - it's too specific to your business, with that analytics\ndata you \"need\". The new customer service system also won't - no one else in\nthe hospitality industry is crying out for Kafka-based replayability of hotel\ncomplaints.\n\nWhere does the pressure to capitalise come from? Generally from managers. Most\nbusiness units have some income and some expenses. If you start capitalising\nstuff those expenses disappear and, better yet, even start to appear on your\nbalance sheet as an asset - however nebulous. Now your numbers look really\ngood. Accountants have heard this one before and that's why the rules are so\nstrict.\n\nA home truth of mine is that software projects in fact look more like a\nliability than an asset. Software, whether anyone is getting any benefit from\nit or not attracts a huge number of very annoying expenses: security\nvulnerability scrambles, bug fixes and database upgrades, and all of it just\nlines the pockets of wealthy sysadmins.\n\n## Sneaky opex\n\nLike the printers of my teenage years, some things appear to be products but\nin fact are subscriptions. One sign of a product that is secretly a\nsubscription is networking: if it connects to the internet, and thus to some\nserver, it is likely to be a subscription rather than a product - even if the\n\"product\" itself claims otherwise.\n\nMy favourite example of this are the \"smart\" televisions that one day decided,\nall on their own, to start showing adverts: a new, recurring psychic cost for\ntheir subscribers, who had thought they were owners. Another is the tractor\nmanufacturer John Deere, who work hard to ensure that you can no longer keep\nyour tractor in good working order with just a socket set and an owner's\nmanual but also need a paid-up subscription to their online services (else\nthey will remotely disable crucial features).\n\nTo paraphrase Leslie Lamport, a secret subscription is one in which the\nreliance on a server which you did not even know existed can render new\nexpenses onto your continued use of the \"product\".\n\nSometimes, though, \"opex\" is ok. There are times when you truly want a little\nbite out of something that is very big. You want, for a few hours or minutes,\nto have access to an enormous data centre: then hourly rental of cloud\ncomputers is the thing for you. All of the low-level sysadmin knowledge\nrequired to operate such a thing is encompassed in the service offered - and\nthey are quite open about it being a service.\n\n## Corporate finance, upside-down\n\nIn any given scenario, a company (or person) will want to buy or rent\nsomething they need and they should decide carefully which to do. It's fair to\nsay that the answer to that question is the total subject of corporate\nfinance.\n\nCompanies rarely succeed based on good corporate finance alone but there is a\nkind of upside-down corporate finance that can really help: to make your\nsuppliers and customers do bad corporate finance.\n\nAn example, very of-the-moment, is to turn what would otherwise be a single\npurchase of a software package into a long-term rental - a \"SaaS\". This\nhappened with Adobe Photoshop, which was happily a thing you could buy a copy\nof for decades until Adobe realised that they could really start cooking with\ngas if they only made it available for an ongoing fee. For Adobe's\nsubscribers, the lock-in is considerable as access to their existing bank of\nfiles and documents is contingent on continued payment.\n\nAnother example occurs in business-to-business deals. If one party to the deal\nis stronger than the other they will often make the weaker party apply their\ncapital rather than invest their own. Supermarkets often only stock items on\n\"consignment\" - meaning they pay nothing until the items sell (in fact,\nusually 90 days after that) and have the right to return them if it doesn't\nsell. This ties up the supplier's capital in the products instead of Tesco's\nand so Tesco have them on the grocer's equivalent of \"no win, no fee\".\n\nA third example is cars. Cars are an extremely annoying product to sell\nbecause they are not much use unless they are reliable and if you do make them\nreliable they tend to last a long time - about 20 years. In order to ensure\nthat most people do not go two decades between new cars, carmakers have\nenormous consumer finance departments and they strongly encourage people to\nget their cars via an exceptionally confusing monthly subscription plan called\na \"PCP\". The gist of a PCP is that you pay \u00a3250-\u00a3500 per month for 4-5 years\nand at the end you do not own the car - despite pseudo-financial mutterings to\nthe contrary about \"deposits\", \"equity\" and \"options to purchase\" (my golden\nrule as a consumer is never to buy a financial derivative). At the end of\ntheir 4-5 year contract these secret renters are bamboozled at the dealership\nand convinced to just \"roll over\" their deal onto a new car with much the same\nmonthly payment and, again, no ownership. It costs considerably more to do\nthis great rigmarole than just to buy outright.\n\nGood business sense is to do only what is reasonable for yourself but great\nbusiness sense is to make others do what is not.\n\n## Contact/etc\n\nPlease do send me an email about this article, especially if you disagreed\nwith it.\n\nSee other things I've written.\n\nGet an alert when I write something new, by email or RSS .\n\nI am on:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Mastodon\n  * and Linkedin.\n\n\ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddee I have moved to Helsinki and am organising the Helsinki Python group.

I still think this\na very pretty sharp interview question. It's a shame my own field does not\nhave such a good \"which way is up?\" interview question.\n\nThe older I get the more widely applicable I think corporate finance knowledge\nis. For example I enjoyed this article discussing it's relevance to computer\ngame development.\n\nI love Michael Porter's Strategy and the Internet. It would seem reasonable to\nassumed that any writing on strategy regarding the internet from 2001 would be\nso dated as to be irrelevant but I think it still hasn't been adopted fully. I\nalso loved Information Rules which covers some of the same material but from a\nmore economic perspective.\n\nI have not gotten onto all the incredible hijinks of the printer cartridge\nbusiness but will put some quick facts here, all accurate as of mid-2008:\n\n  * Many inkjet manufacturers put all the colours in a single cartridge and then block it from printing when any of them get low. Usually one gets low first and you have to buy a whole new cartridge.\n  * Inkjet manufacturers have no consensus on whether it's better for reliability to have the ink dropper on the cartridge or built in to the printer. The trade-off is that the dropper can dry out from inactivity or wear out from overuse. Those who think it'll probably dry it out first put it on the cartridge and those who think you'll wear it out first put it on the printer mechanism.\n  * Below a certain (actually quite high) level of printed pages per year, you are better off renting access to printers. The big box shop I worked for would do colour printing for 5p a page (monochrome for much less) which really was a screaming deal but very, very few customers used it. They all wanted to own their own printer for that one time they'd print off an 8-colour pie chart at home, in a rush or late at night. Of course.\n  * The average user prints exactly one colour page during the lifetime of their colour printer. It is usually the test page.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
