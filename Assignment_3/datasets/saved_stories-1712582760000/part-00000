The advertising is\npresented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change\nactions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that\nthey are in an urban zone.\n\nA large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online\nadvertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its\naudience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and\navoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles\nabout how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been\npresented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often.\n\nVendors we use for this purpose42 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * Adform\n  * Advanced store\n  * Amazon Ad Server\n  * Appier\n  * AudienceProject\n  * Bannernow\n\n1-10 of 42\n\nCreate profiles for personalised advertising\n\nInformation about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit,\ncontent you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about\nyou (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and\nother websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or\nimprove a profile about you (that might include possible interests and\npersonal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present\nadvertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by\nthis and other entities.\n\nIf you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this\ninformation could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike\naccessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a\ndifferent website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike\naccessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury\ncar manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your\ninterest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are\ninterested in luxury cycling gear.\n\nAn apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It\ngets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income\ncustomers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create\nprofiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to\nhave a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising\nwithin partner apps based on those profiles.\n\nVendors we use for this purpose129 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * A.Mob\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdElement Media Solutions\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * AdSpirit AdServer\n  * AdTheorent\n  * AdTiming\n\n1-10 of 129\n\nUse profiles to select personalised advertising\n\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising\nprofiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or\napps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and\npersonal aspects.\n\nAn online retailer wants to advertise a limited sale on running shoes. It\nwants to target advertising to users who previously looked at running shoes on\nits mobile app. Tracking technologies might be used to recognise that you have\npreviously used the mobile app to consult running shoes, in order to present\nyou with the corresponding advertisement on the app.\n\nA profile created for personalised advertising in relation to a person having\nsearched for bike accessories on a website can be used to present the relevant\nadvertisement for bike accessories on a mobile app of another organisation.\n\nVendors we use for this purpose127 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * A.Mob\n  * ADventori\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdElement Media Solutions\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * AdSpirit AdServer\n  * AdTheorent\n\n1-10 of 127\n\nMeasure advertising performance\n\nInformation regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you\ninteract with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for\nyou or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For\ninstance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you\nto buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand\nthe relevance of advertising campaigns.\n\nYou have clicked on an advertisement about a \u201cblack Friday\u201d discount by an\nonline shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click\nwill be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will\nbe measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.\n\nYou are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an\n\u201cinternational appreciation day\u201d discount by an online gift shop within the\napp of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how\noften a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the \u201cinternational\nappreciation day\u201d ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in\norder to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad\nplacements.\n\nVendors we use for this purpose76 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * Adelaide\n  * Adform\n  * Adikteev\n  * Adloox\n  * Adnami\n\n1-10 of 76\n\nUnderstand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different\nsources\n\nReports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user\nprofiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your\ninteractions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising)\ncontent to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which\ntarget audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).\n\nThe owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the\nproportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or\nconsulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as\nthe average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data\nrelating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics\nis then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.\n\nAn advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with\nits adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics\nof users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of\nsimilar platforms, across different devices.

Thompson and Nico Grant\n\nReporting from San Francisco, Washington and New York\n\n  * April 6, 2024\n\nIn late 2021, OpenAI faced a supply problem.\n\nThe artificial intelligence lab had exhausted every reservoir of reputable\nEnglish-language text on the internet as it developed its latest A.I. system.\nIt needed more data to train the next version of its technology \u2014 lots more.\n\nSo OpenAI researchers created a speech recognition tool called Whisper. It\ncould transcribe the audio from YouTube videos, yielding new conversational\ntext that would make an A.I. system smarter.\n\nSome OpenAI employees discussed how such a move might go against YouTube\u2019s\nrules, three people with knowledge of the conversations said. YouTube, which\nis owned by Google, prohibits use of its videos for applications that are\n\u201cindependent\u201d of the video platform.\n\nUltimately, an OpenAI team transcribed more than one million hours of YouTube\nvideos, the people said. The team included Greg Brockman, OpenAI\u2019s president,\nwho personally helped collect the videos, two of the people said. The texts\nwere then fed into a system called GPT-4, which was widely considered one of\nthe world\u2019s most powerful A.I. models and was the basis of the latest version\nof the ChatGPT chatbot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe race to lead A.I. has become a desperate hunt for the digital data needed\nto advance the technology. To obtain that data, tech companies including\nOpenAI, Google and Meta have cut corners, ignored corporate policies and\ndebated bending the law, according to an examination by The New York Times.\n\nAt Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, managers, lawyers and engineers\nlast year discussed buying the publishing house Simon & Schuster to procure\nlong works, according to recordings of internal meetings obtained by The\nTimes. They also conferred on gathering copyrighted data from across the\ninternet, even if that meant facing lawsuits. Negotiating licenses with\npublishers, artists, musicians and the news industry would take too long, they\nsaid.\n\nLike OpenAI, Google transcribed YouTube videos to harvest text for its A.I.\nmodels, five people with knowledge of the company\u2019s practices said. That\npotentially violated the copyrights to the videos, which belong to their\ncreators.\n\nLast year, Google also broadened its terms of service. One motivation for the\nchange, according to members of the company\u2019s privacy team and an internal\nmessage viewed by The Times, was to allow Google to be able to tap publicly\navailable Google Docs, restaurant reviews on Google Maps and other online\nmaterial for more of its A.I. products.\n\nThe companies\u2019 actions illustrate how online information \u2014 news stories,\nfictional works, message board posts, Wikipedia articles, computer programs,\nphotos, podcasts and movie clips \u2014 has increasingly become the lifeblood of\nthe booming A.I. industry. Creating innovative systems depends on having\nenough data to teach the technologies to instantly produce text, images,\nsounds and videos that resemble what a human creates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe volume of data is crucial. Leading chatbot systems have learned from pools\nof digital text spanning as many as three trillion words, or roughly twice the\nnumber of words stored in Oxford University\u2019s Bodleian Library, which has\ncollected manuscripts since 1602. The most prized data, A.I. researchers said,\nis high-quality information, such as published books and articles, which have\nbeen carefully written and edited by professionals.\n\nFor years, the internet \u2014 with sites like Wikipedia and Reddit \u2014 was a\nseemingly endless source of data. But as A.I. advanced, tech companies sought\nmore repositories. Google and Meta, which have billions of users who produce\nsearch queries and social media posts every day, were largely limited by\nprivacy laws and their own policies from drawing on much of that content for\nA.I.\n\nTheir situation is urgent. Tech companies could run through the high-quality\ndata on the internet as soon as 2026, according to Epoch, a research\ninstitute. The companies are using the data faster than it is being produced.\n\n\u201cThe only practical way for these tools to exist is if they can be trained on\nmassive amounts of data without having to license that data,\u201d Sy Damle, a\nlawyer who represents Andreessen Horowitz, a Silicon Valley venture capital\nfirm, said of A.I. models last year in a public discussion about copyright\nlaw. \u201cThe data needed is so massive that even collective licensing really\ncan\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nTech companies are so hungry for new data that some are developing \u201csynthetic\u201d\ninformation. This is not organic data created by humans, but text, images and\ncode that A.I. models produce \u2014 in other words, the systems learn from what\nthey themselves generate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nOpenAI said each of its A.I. models \u201chas a unique data set that we curate to\nhelp their understanding of the world and remain globally competitive in\nresearch.\u201d Google said that its A.I. models \u201care trained on some YouTube\ncontent,\u201d which was allowed under agreements with YouTube creators, and that\nthe company did not use data from office apps outside of an experimental\nprogram. Meta said it had \u201cmade aggressive investments\u201d to integrate A.I. into\nits services and had billions of publicly shared images and videos from\nInstagram and Facebook for training its models.\n\nFor creators, the growing use of their works by A.I. companies has prompted\nlawsuits over copyright and licensing. The Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft\nlast year for using copyrighted news articles without permission to train A.I.\nchatbots. OpenAI and Microsoft have said using the articles was \u201cfair use,\u201d or\nallowed under copyright law, because they transformed the works for a\ndifferent purpose.\n\nMore than 10,000 trade groups, authors, companies and others submitted\ncomments last year about the use of creative works by A.I. models to the\nCopyright Office, a federal agency that is preparing guidance on how copyright\nlaw applies in the A.I. era.\n\nJustine Bateman, a filmmaker, former actress and author of two books, told the\nCopyright Office that A.I. models were taking content \u2014 including her writing\nand films \u2014 without permission or payment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThis is the largest theft in the United States, period,\u201d she said in an\ninterview.\n\n## \u2018Scale Is All You Need\u2019\n\nImage\n\nJared Kaplan, a theoretical physicist at Johns Hopkins University, wrote a key\npaper on A.I. and data. He is also the chief science officer of the A.I.\nstart-up Anthropic. Credit...Chris J. Ratcliffe/Bloomberg\n\nIn January 2020, Jared Kaplan, a theoretical physicist at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity, published a groundbreaking paper on A.I. that stoked the appetite\nfor online data.\n\nHis conclusion was unequivocal: The more data there was to train a large\nlanguage model \u2014 the technology that drives online chatbots \u2014 the better it\nwould perform. Just as a student learns more by reading more books, large\nlanguage models can better pinpoint patterns in text and be more accurate with\nmore information.\n\n\u201cEveryone was very surprised that these trends \u2014 these scaling laws as we call\nthem \u2014 were basically as precise as what you see in astronomy or physics,\u201d\nsaid Dr. Kaplan, who published the paper with nine OpenAI researchers. (He now\nworks at the A.I. start-up Anthropic.)\n\n\u201cScale is all you need\u201d soon became a rallying cry for A.I.\n\nResearchers have long used large public databases of digital information to\ndevelop A.I., including Wikipedia and Common Crawl, a database of more than\n250 billion web pages collected since 2007. Researchers often \u201ccleaned\u201d the\ndata by removing hate speech and other unwanted text before using it to train\nA.I. models.\n\nIn 2020, data sets were tiny by today\u2019s standards. One database containing\n30,000 photographs from the photo website Flickr was considered a vital\nresource at the time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nAfter Dr. Kaplan\u2019s paper, that amount of data was no longer enough. It became\nall about \u201cjust making things really big,\u201d said Brandon Duderstadt, the chief\nexecutive of Nomic, an A.I. company in New York.\n\nBefore 2020, most A.I. models used relatively little training data.\n\nMr. Kaplan\u2019s paper, released in 2020, led to a new era defined by GPT-3, a\nlarge language model, where researchers began including more data in their\nmodels ...\n\n... much, much more data.\n\nNote: Includes estimates. Source: Epoch.\n\nWhen OpenAI unveiled GPT-3 in November 2020, it was trained on the largest\namount of data to date \u2014 about 300 billion \u201ctokens,\u201d which are essentially\nwords or pieces of words. After learning from that data, the system generated\ntext with astounding accuracy, writing blog posts, poetry and its own computer\nprograms.\n\nIn 2022, DeepMind, an A.I. lab owned by Google, went further. It tested 400\nA.I. models and varied the amount of training data and other factors. The top-\nperforming models used even more data than Dr. Kaplan had predicted in his\npaper. One model, Chinchilla, was trained on 1.4 trillion tokens.\n\nIt was soon overtaken. Last year, researchers from China released an A.I.\nmodel, Skywork, which was trained on 3.2 trillion tokens from English and\nChinese texts. Google also unveiled an A.I. system, PaLM 2, which topped 3.6\ntrillion tokens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\n## Transcribing YouTube\n\nIn May, Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, acknowledged that A.I.\ncompanies would use up all viable data on the internet.\n\n\u201cThat will run out,\u201d he said in a speech at a tech conference.\n\nMr. Altman had seen the phenomenon up close. At OpenAI, researchers had\ngathered data for years, cleaned it and fed it into a vast pool of text to\ntrain the company\u2019s language models. They had mined the computer code\nrepository GitHub, vacuumed up databases of chess moves and drawn on data\ndescribing high school tests and homework assignments from the website\nQuizlet.\n\nBy late 2021, those supplies were depleted, said eight people with knowledge\nof the company, who were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nOpenAI was desperate for more data to develop its next-generation A.I. model,\nGPT-4. So employees discussed transcribing podcasts, audiobooks and YouTube\nvideos, the people said. They talked about creating data from scratch with\nA.I. systems. They also considered buying start-ups that had collected large\namounts of digital data.\n\nOpenAI eventually made Whisper, the speech recognition tool, to transcribe\nYouTube videos and podcasts, six people said. But YouTube prohibits people\nfrom not only using its videos for \u201cindependent\u201d applications, but also\naccessing its videos by \u201cany automated means (such as robots, botnets or\nscrapers).\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nOpenAI employees knew they were wading into a legal gray area, the people\nsaid, but believed that training A.I. with the videos was fair use. Mr.\nBrockman, OpenAI\u2019s president, was listed in a research paper as a creator of\nWhisper. He personally helped gather YouTube videos and fed them into the\ntechnology, two people said.\n\nMr. Brockman referred requests for comment to OpenAI, which said it uses\n\u201cnumerous sources\u201d of data.\n\nLast year, OpenAI released GPT-4, which drew on the more than one million\nhours of YouTube videos that Whisper had transcribed. Mr. Brockman led the\nteam that developed GPT-4.\n\nSome Google employees were aware that OpenAI had harvested YouTube videos for\ndata, two people with knowledge of the companies said. But they didn\u2019t stop\nOpenAI because Google had also used transcripts of YouTube videos to train its\nA.I. models, the people said. That practice may have violated the copyrights\nof YouTube creators. So if Google made a fuss about OpenAI, there might be a\npublic outcry against its own methods, the people said.\n\nMatt Bryant, a Google spokesman, said the company had no knowledge of OpenAI\u2019s\npractices and prohibited \u201cunauthorized scraping or downloading of YouTube\ncontent.\u201d Google takes action when it has a clear legal or technical basis to\ndo so, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nGoogle\u2019s rules allowed it to tap YouTube user data to develop new features for\nthe video platform. But it was unclear whether Google could use YouTube data\nto build a commercial service beyond the video platform, such as a chatbot.\n\nGeoffrey Lottenberg, an intellectual property lawyer with the law firm Berger\nSingerman, said Google\u2019s language about what it could and could not do with\nYouTube video transcripts was vague.\n\n\u201cWhether the data could be used for a new commercial service is open to\ninterpretation and could be litigated,\u201d he said.\n\nIn late 2022, after OpenAI released ChatGPT and set off an industrywide race\nto catch up, Google researchers and engineers discussed tapping other user\ndata. Billions of words sat in people\u2019s Google Docs and other free Google\napps. But the company\u2019s privacy restrictions limited how they could use the\ndata, three people with knowledge of Google\u2019s practices said.\n\nImage\n\nAfter OpenAI released ChatGPT, Google researchers and engineers discussed\ntapping other user data to develop A.I. products, people with knowledge of the\ndiscussions said.

The employees said they didn\u2019t know if the company had previously\ntrained A.I. on such data.\n\nAt the time, Google\u2019s privacy policy said the company could use publicly\navailable information only to \u201chelp train Google\u2019s language models and build\nfeatures like Google Translate.\u201d\n\nThe privacy team wrote new terms so Google could tap the data for its \u201cA.I.\nmodels and build products and features like Google Translate, Bard and Cloud\nAI capabilities,\u201d which was a wider collection of A.I. technologies.\n\n\u201cWhat is the end goal here?\u201d one member of the privacy team asked in an\ninternal message. \u201cHow broad are we going?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe team was told specifically to release the new terms on the Fourth of July\nweekend, when people were typically focused on the holiday, the employees\nsaid. The revised policy debuted on July 1, at the start of the long weekend.\n\n## How Google Can Use Your Data\n\nHere are the changes Google made to its privacy policy last year for its free\nconsumer apps.\n\nGoogle uses information to improve our services and to develop new products,\nfeatures and technologies that benefit our users and the public.

They were not given clear answers, they said.\n\nMr. Bryant said that the privacy policy changes had been made for clarity and\nthat Google did not use information from Google Docs or related apps to train\nlanguage models \u201cwithout explicit permission\u201d from users, referring to a\nvoluntary program that allows users to test experimental features.\n\n\u201cWe did not start training on additional types of data based on this language\nchange,\u201d he said.\n\n## The Debate at Meta\n\nMark Zuckerberg, Meta\u2019s chief executive, had invested in A.I. for years \u2014 but\nsuddenly found himself behind when OpenAI released ChatGPT in 2022. He\nimmediately pushed to match and exceed ChatGPT, calling executives and\nengineers at all hours of the night to push them to develop a rival chatbot,\nsaid three current and former employees, who were not authorized to discuss\nconfidential conversations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut by early last year, Meta had hit the same hurdle as its rivals: not enough\ndata.\n\nAhmad Al-Dahle, Meta\u2019s vice president of generative A.I., told executives that\nhis team had used almost every available English-language book, essay, poem\nand news article on the internet to develop a model, according to recordings\nof internal meetings, which were shared by an employee.\n\nMeta could not match ChatGPT unless it got more data, Mr. Al-Dahle told\ncolleagues. In March and April 2023, some of the company\u2019s business\ndevelopment leaders, engineers and lawyers met nearly daily to tackle the\nproblem.\n\nSome debated paying $10 a book for the full licensing rights to new titles.\nThey discussed buying Simon & Schuster, which publishes authors like Stephen\nKing, according to the recordings.\n\nThey also talked about how they had summarized books, essays and other works\nfrom the internet without permission and discussed sucking up more, even if\nthat meant facing lawsuits. One lawyer warned of \u201cethical\u201d concerns around\ntaking intellectual property from artists but was met with silence, according\nto the recordings.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg demanded a solution, employees said.\n\n\u201cThe capability that Mark is looking for in the product is just something that\nwe currently aren\u2019t able to deliver,\u201d one engineer said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nImage\n\nMark Zuckerberg, Meta\u2019s chief executive, pushed his company to catch up in\ngenerative A.I. after OpenAI released ChatGPT.Credit...Jason Andrew for The\nNew York Times\n\nWhile Meta operates giant social networks, it didn\u2019t have troves of user posts\nat its disposal, two employees said. Many Facebook users had deleted their\nearlier posts, and the platform wasn\u2019t where people wrote essay-type content,\nthey said.\n\nMeta was also limited by privacy changes it introduced after a 2018 scandal\nover sharing its users\u2019 data with Cambridge Analytica, a voter-profiling\ncompany.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg said in a recent investor call that the billions of publicly\nshared videos and photos on Facebook and Instagram are \u201cgreater than the\nCommon Crawl data set.\u201d\n\nDuring their recorded discussions, Meta executives talked about how they had\nhired contractors in Africa to aggregate summaries of fiction and nonfiction.\nThe summaries included copyrighted content \u201cbecause we have no way of not\ncollecting that,\u201d a manager said in one meeting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nMeta\u2019s executives said OpenAI seemed to have used copyrighted material without\npermission. It would take Meta too long to negotiate licenses with publishers,\nartists, musicians and the news industry, they said, according to the\nrecordings.\n\n\u201cThe only thing that\u2019s holding us back from being as good as ChatGPT is\nliterally just data volume,\u201d Nick Grudin, a vice president of global\npartnership and content, said in one meeting.\n\nOpenAI appeared to be taking copyrighted material and Meta could follow this\n\u201cmarket precedent,\u201d he added.\n\nMeta\u2019s executives agreed to lean on a 2015 court decision involving the\nAuthors Guild versus Google, according to the recordings. In that case, Google\nwas permitted to scan, digitize and catalog books in an online database after\narguing that it had reproduced only snippets of the works online and had\ntransformed the originals, which made it fair use.\n\nUsing data to train A.I. systems, Meta\u2019s lawyers said in their meetings,\nshould similarly be fair use.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nAt least two employees raised concerns about using intellectual property and\nnot paying authors and other artists fairly or at all, according to the\nrecordings. One employee recounted a separate discussion about copyrighted\ndata with senior executives including Chris Cox, Meta\u2019s chief product officer,\nand said no one in that meeting considered the ethics of using people\u2019s\ncreative works.\n\n## \u2018Synthetic\u2019 Data\n\nOpenAI\u2019s Mr. Altman had a plan to deal with the looming data shortage.\n\nCompanies like his, he said at the May conference, would eventually train\ntheir A.I. on text generated by A.I. \u2014 otherwise known as synthetic data.\n\nSince an A.I. model can produce humanlike text, Mr. Altman and others have\nargued, the systems can create additional data to develop better versions of\nthemselves. This would help developers build increasingly powerful technology\nand reduce their dependence on copyrighted data.\n\n\u201cAs long as you can get over the synthetic data event horizon, where the model\nis smart enough to make good synthetic data, everything will be fine,\u201d Mr.\nAltman said.\n\nA.I. researchers have explored synthetic data for years. But building an A.I\nsystem that can train itself is easier said than done. A.I. models that learn\nfrom their own outputs can get caught in a loop where they reinforce their own\nquirks, mistakes and limitations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe data these systems need is like a path through the jungle,\u201d said Jeff\nClune, a former OpenAI researcher who now teaches computer science at the\nUniversity of British Columbia. \u201cIf they only train on synthetic data, they\ncan get lost in the jungle.\u201d\n\nTo combat this, OpenAI and others are investigating how two different A.I.\nmodels might work together to generate synthetic data that is more useful and\nreliable. One system produces the data, while a second judges the information\nto separate the good from the bad. Researchers are divided on whether this\nmethod will work.\n\nA.I. executives are barreling ahead nonetheless.\n\n\u201cIt should be all right,\u201d Mr. Altman said at the conference.\n\nA correction was made on\n\nApril 6, 2024\n\n:\n\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the publisher of J.K.
