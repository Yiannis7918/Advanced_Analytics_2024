Most animal\nenthusiasts know that blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) are the largest\nanimals, but few are aware of our planet's most miniature inhabitants. So,\nwhat is the smallest animal?\n\nThere's always the potential for undiscovered species to emerge, but it's hard\nto imagine animals getting any smaller than myxozoans, a group of microscopic\ninvertebrates related to jellyfish.\n\nBeth Okamura, a professor at the Natural History Museum in London, believes\nmyxozoans are the smallest animals on Earth because many myxozoan species are\njust a single cell as adults.\n\n\"All of us at some point in our life cycle have tiny stages, but when we're\nmature, we're complex multicellular animals,\" Okamura said. \"That's not the\ncase for Myxozoa. When they mature, they're still single cells.\"\n\nRelated: What is the most genetically diverse species?\n\nMyxozoans can be as small as 0.02 millimeter (20 micrometers) across as\nadults. For scale, that's up to 100 times smaller than a grain of sand,\naccording to the University of Hawaii.\n\nAn Etruscan shrew (Suncus etruscus), one of the smallest mammals on Earth.\n(Image credit: Antonio Petrone/Shutterstock.com)\n\nThe Myxozoa subphylum has evolved a simple form that suits its parasitic life\ncycle. Most myxozoan species produce infectious water-borne spores. Cells from\nthese spores invade and develop inside both vertebrate hosts, such as fish,\nand invertebrate hosts, like annelid worms, Okamura explained.\n\n## Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now\n\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nFor example, some myxozoans \u2014 certain ceratomyxids \u2014 infect the gallbladders\nof Amazon fish and \"grow\" into worm-like creatures similar to multicellular\nnematodes but with unicellular bodies.\n\nWhile some myxozoans cause diseases in their hosts, many are harmless. This\ninnocuousness, combined with their tiny size, means scientists often overlook\nthese minuscule creatures. However, there are thousands of myxozoan species\nliving all over the world. \"The more you look, the more you find,\" Okamura\nsaid.\n\nA magnified image of a myxozoan (Myxobolus cerebralis), a parasite that lives\nin salmon and trout species.

For\nexample, the smallest-mammal title is shared between Etruscan shrews (Suncus\netruscus) and bumblebee bats (Craseonycteris thonglongyai), according to a\n2012 study published in the journal Mammal Review.\n\nThe University of Michigan's Animal Diversity Web considers bumblebee bats to\nbe the shorter of the two species, with a length of 1.1 to 1.3 inches (2.9 to\n3.3 centimeters), while the shrews can grow up to 2 inches (5 cm) long.\nHowever, bumblebee bats also have a wingspan of around 6 inches (15 cm), so\nthey're considerably wider than shrews during flight.\n\nThe smallest vertebrates of all are miniature frogs, several of which are less\nthan an inch in length. In a February 2024 study published in the journal\nZoologica Scripta, Mirco Sol\u00e9, a professor of zoology at the State University\nof Santa Cruz in Brazil, crowned a frog called Brachycephalus pulex the\nsmallest known vertebrate.\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\n\u2014Which group of animals has the most species?\n\n\u2014Why are animals so colorful?\n\n\u2014Can animals really smell fear in humans?\n\nSol\u00e9 and his colleagues found that mature female B. pulex average just 0.32\ninch (8.15 mm) in length, while males are even shorter, at 0.28 inch (7.1 mm)\n\u2014 small enough to fit on a human fingernail.\n\nThis tiny species is found only on two mountains in the eastern Brazilian\nstate of Bahia. B. pulex lives in leaf litter near rivers and mainly eats\nmites. \"Most animals do not feed on mites because they are so small,\" Sol\u00e9\nsaid.\n\nWhile B. pulex is currently the smallest vertebrate researchers have found,\nSol\u00e9 noted that there could be an even smaller frog out there.\n\n\"We are still far away from knowing what's living on the planet,\" he said.\n\"It's the smallest now.\"\n\nPatrick Pester\n\nLive Science Contributor\n\nPatrick Pester is a freelance writer and previously a staff writer at Live\nScience.
