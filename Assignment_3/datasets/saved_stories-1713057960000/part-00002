Unemployment rates have returned to pre-pandemic lows, commentators\ncorrectly point out, and the official rate of inflation is declining. So why\nare Americans ignoring the view of many experts that the economy is doing\nwell?\n\nAccording to a striking new paper by a group of economists from Harvard and\nthe International Monetary Fund, headlined by former Treasury Secretary Larry\nSummers, the answer is that Americans have figured out something that the\nexperts have ignored: that rising interest rates are as much a part of\ninflation as the rising price of ordinary goods. \u201cConcerns over borrowing\ncosts, which have historically tracked the cost of money, are at their highest\nlevels\u201d since the early 1980s, they write. \u201cAlternative measures of inflation\nthat include borrowing costs\u201d account for most of the gap between the experts\u2019\nrosy pictures and Americans\u2019 skeptical assessment.\n\n## Inflation is not an objective number, but a judgment call\n\nAt the heart of the issue is a misconception that bedevils academics,\njournalists, and ordinary Americans: the idea that the official inflation rate\nis an objective number, impervious to human biases, much in the way that\nsomeone\u2019s height or weight can be objectively measured with a ruler and a\nscale.\n\nIn fact, the formula used to calculate the inflation rate is subjective. It\nrequires economists to make hundreds of judgment calls about how one assesses\nthe overall trajectory of prices. What goods and services should be included\nin the \u201cbasket\u201d of prices in the formula? How should those goods and services\nbe weighted against each other? How do we account for the fact that poor\npeople consume different things than rich people, or that people in different\nparts of the country may consume different things in different proportions?\n\nAnd, most relevant to the new research: What is the best way to measure\nchanges in the price of important things like housing? There has always been\nconsiderable debate about this.\n\nThe most widely used measure of inflation in the U.S. is the Consumer Price\nIndex for All Urban Consumers, or CPI-U, which is put out by the U.S. Bureau\nof Labor Statistics (BLS). This formula has undergone numerous revisions from\nits creation in 1919 to the present day.\n\n## Consumer prices no longer include the price of money\n\nMost notably, as Summers and his coauthors Marijn Bolhuis, Judd Cramer, and\nKarl Schulz point out, in 1983 the BLS eliminated interest costs from its\ncalculations of consumer price inflation. The argument at the time, made by\nBLS economist Robert Gillingham, was that including home mortgage interest\nrates in the CPI formula was overstating inflation. Instead, Gillingham\nargued, the BLS should estimate what homeowners could charge if they rented\nout their homes, and use that to calculate housing inflation.\n\nThis change had a huge impact on the calculation of CPI, write Bolhuis et al.,\nbecause the BLS removed housing prices and financing costs from the official\nCPI formula, even though everyday Americans still experienced those costs in\nthe real world. \u201cOwners\u2019 equivalent rent\u201d\u2014the new CPI measure\u2014amounts to over\na quarter of the Consumer Price Index today.\n\nBolhuis et al. point out that the elimination of interest costs from CPI isn\u2019t\njust about housing. \u201cNew and used vehicles combine to represent nearly 7\npercent of the CPI,\u201d they point out, but \u201cexclude financing costs.\u201d Given that\nfour-fifths of all new cars were purchased using auto loans, this makes no\nsense.\n\nFurthermore, more people buy consumer goods with credit cards than with\ncash\u2014and yet the interest costs of credit cards aren\u2019t included in the\nofficial BLS formula. \u201cMeasurements of the cost of living that exclude\nfinancing costs,\u201d Bolhuis et al. argue, \u201cwill understate the pressure under\nwhich consumers, who rely on credit for many purchases, have found\nthemselves.\u201d\n\nInclusive of interest costs, inflation reached 18% in November 2022, and\nremains elevated.\n\nNBER.org\n\n## What would inflation look like under the pre-1983 formula?\n\nBolhuis et al. then went on to see if they could recalculate the official CPI\nnumbers using a pre-1983-like formula that incorporated the cost of mortgage\ninterest, auto loan interest, and credit card interest on the cost of living.\nThey found three things: first, that the pre-1983-like formula led to a\ndramatically different estimate of inflation in 2022 and 2023, peaking at 18\npercent in November 2022.\n\nSecond, they found that consumer sentiment\u2014as measured by the widely-used\nUniversity of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment\u2014correlated much more\nstrongly with the pre-1983 CPI formula than it did with the modern one that\nexcludes interest costs.\n\nThird, they found these differences to be also true in Europe: higher interest\nrates were correlated with lower consumer sentiment, and vice versa. This was\nan important finding, as some have suggested that the gap between American\nconsumer sentiment and the official government statistics is a result of\nAmericans\u2019 mistrust of institutions and mainstream sources of information. \u201cWe\nfind little evidence that the United States, despite its rising partisanship,\nsocial distrust, and large reported levels of overall \u2018referred pain\u2019 differ\nmeaningfully\u201d in their economic perceptions from those in peer nations.\n\n\u201cConsumers are including the cost of money in their perspective on their\neconomic well-being, while economists are not,\u201d the authors conclude. Since\nhome and auto purchases \u201care integral to American consumers\u2019 sense of their\neconomic well being but their price is not included in official inflation\nmeasures, it is no wonder that sentiment lags traditional measures of economic\nperformance.\u201d\n\n## The gap between CPI and the pre-1983 formula could widen over time\n\nThere are other obvious problems with relying on the declining rate of\nofficial CPI inflation to gauge what consumers should be feeling. Inflation is\ncumulative; a decline in the rate of inflation does not reverse the price\nincreases from previous years; it simply means that prices are now rising at a\nslower rate.\n\nMost importantly, the exclusion of interest costs from the CPI and the Federal\nReserve\u2019s preferred measure of Personal Consumption Expenditures could become\na growing problem over time, due to the ever-expanding federal debt.\n\nAs the debt increases, the federal government has to borrow more money from\nU.S. and foreign investors. But as would-be lenders to the U.S. see America as\nincreasingly insolvent, investors will demand higher interest rates to lend us\nthat money. Higher rates of government borrowing lead to higher rates for home\nmortgages, credit cards, student loans, car loans, and every other form of\nborrowing. And, as we\u2019ve seen, these higher interest rates lead to higher\nprice inflation, whether or not the Bureau of Labor Statistics recognizes it\nas such.\n\nIn recent years, the Federal Reserve has suppressed these higher interest\nrates by printing new dollars out of thin air to lend to the U.S. government.\nBut printing new money can also cause inflation, by decreasing the purchasing\npower of each preexisting dollar in circulation.\n\n## We need a healthier debate on how to measure consumer price inflation\n\nThose who believe in the primacy of experts have long attacked those who\nquestion the accuracy of the BLS\u2019 inflation measures. Balaji Srinivasan, the\nventure capitalist and entrepreneur, was criticized by mainstream commentators\nfor investing in Truflation, an attempt at independently developing a measure\nof inflation using real-time price data from a variety of sources.\n\nBut whether one likes or dislikes Truflation\u2019s methodology, we should be\nencouraging independent thinking on how best to measure prices in the economy.\nAs the IMF-Harvard analysis shows, the Bureau of Labor Statistics is capable\nof making misjudgments. My colleagues Jackson Mejia and Jon Hartley at the\nFoundation for Research on Equal Opportunity have shown that even relatively\nlow rates of inflation disproportionately harm the poor, because the poor lack\nthe financial wherewithal to absorb higher consumer prices.\n\nIt\u2019s important\u2014and healthy\u2014for us to look at different measures of consumer\nprices. Everyone has a stake in the outcome, especially those who live\npaycheck to paycheck.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other\nwork here.
