It originated from a discussion between physicists John von\nNeumann and Enrico Fermi.\n\n## History[edit]\n\nIn a 2004 article in the journal Nature, Freeman Dyson recounts his meeting\nwith Fermi in 1953. Fermi evokes his friend von Neumann who, when asking him\nhow many arbitrary parameters he used for his calculations, replied, \"With\nfour parameters I can fit an elephant, and with five I can make him wiggle his\ntrunk.\" By this he meant that the Fermi simulations relied on too many input\nparameters, presupposing an overfitting phenomenon.^[1]\n\n  * John von Neumann\n\n  * Enrico Fermi\n\n  * Freeman Dyson in 2005\n\nSolving the problem (defining four complex numbers to draw an elephantine\nshape) subsequently became an active research subject of recreational\nmathematics. A 1975 attempt through least-squares function approximation\nrequired dozens of terms.^[2] The best approximation was found by three\nphysicists in 2010.^[3]\n\n## Construction[edit]\n\nThe construction is based on complex Fourier analysis.\n\nFermi-Neumann elephant\n\nThe curve found in 2010 is parameterized by:\n\nThe four fixed parameters used are complex, with affixes z_1 = 50 - 30i, z_2 =\n18 + 8i, z_3 = 12 - 10i, z_4 = -14 - 60i. The affix point z_5 = 40 + 20i is\nadded to make the eye of the elephant and this value serves as a parameter for\nthe movement of the \"trunk\".^[3]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Epicycloid\n  * Curve fitting\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Dyson, Freeman (January 22, 2004). \"A meeting with Enrico Fermi\".
