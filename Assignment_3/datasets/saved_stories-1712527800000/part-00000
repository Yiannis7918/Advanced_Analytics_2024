But the world will likely pass that threshold within a\ndecade, and global warming is showing little sign of slowing.\n\nThe world is already facing natural disasters of epic proportions as\ntemperatures rise. Heat records are routinely broken. Wildfire seasons are\nmore extreme. Hurricane strength is increasing. Sea level rise is slowly\nsubmerging small island nations and coastal areas.\n\nThe only known method able to quickly arrest this temperature rise is climate\nengineering. (It\u2019s sometimes called geoengineering, sunlight reduction methods\nor solar climate intervention.) This is a set of proposed actions to\ndeliberately alter the climate.\n\nThese actions include mimicking the cooling effects of large volcanic\neruptions by putting large amounts of reflective particles in the atmosphere,\nor making low clouds over the ocean brighter. Both strategies would reflect a\nsmall amount of sunlight back to space to cool the planet.\n\nThere are many unanswered questions, however, about the effects of\ndeliberately altering the climate, and there is no consensus about whether it\nis even a good idea to find out.\n\nPotential climate engineering techniques. Chelsea Thompson NOAACIRES\n\nOne of the largest concerns for many countries when it comes to climate change\nis national security. That doesn\u2019t just mean wars. Risks to food, energy and\nwater supplies are national security issues, as is climate-induced migration.\n\nCould climate engineering help reduce the national security risks of climate\nchange, or would it make things worse? Answering that question is not simple,\nbut researchers who study climate change and national security like we do have\nsome idea of the risks ahead.\n\n## The massive problem of climate change\n\nTo understand what climate engineering might look like in the future, let\u2019s\nfirst talk about why a country might want to try it.\n\nSince the industrial revolution, humans have put about 1.74 trillion tons of\ncarbon dioxide into the atmosphere, largely by burning fossil fuels. That\ncarbon dioxide traps heat, warming the planet.\n\nOne of the most important things we can do is to stop putting carbon into the\natmosphere. But that won\u2019t make the situation better quickly, because carbon\nstays in the atmosphere for centuries. Reducing emissions will just keep\nthings from getting worse.\n\nCountries could pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and lock it away, a\nprocess called carbon dioxide removal. Right now, carbon dioxide removal\nprojects, including growing trees and direct air capture devices, pull about 2\nbillion tons of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere per year.\n\nHowever, humans are currently putting over 37 billion tons of carbon dioxide\ninto the atmosphere annually through fossil fuel use and industry. As long as\nthe amount added is larger than the amount removed, droughts, floods,\nhurricanes, heat waves and sea level rise, among numerous other consequences\nof climate change, will keep getting worse.\n\nIt may take a long time to get to \u201cnet-zero\u201d emissions, the point at which\nhumans aren\u2019t increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.\nClimate engineering might help in the interim.\n\n## Who might try climate engineering and how?\n\nVarious government research arms are already gaming out scenarios, looking at\nwho might decide to carry out climate engineering and how.\n\nClimate engineering is expected to be cheap relative to the cost of ending\ngreenhouse gas emissions. But it would still cost billions of dollars and take\nyears to develop and build a fleet of airplanes to carry megatons of\nreflective particles into the stratosphere each year. Any billionaire\nconsidering such a venture would run out of money quickly, despite what\nscience fiction might suggest.\n\nHowever, a single country or coalition of countries witnessing the harms of\nclimate change could make a cost and geopolitical calculation and decide to\nbegin climate engineering on its own.\n\nThis is the so-called \u201cfree driver\u201d problem, meaning that one country of at\nleast medium wealth could unilaterally affect the world\u2019s climate.\n\nFor example, countries with increasingly dangerous heat waves may want to\ncause cooling, or countries that depend on monsoon precipitation may want to\nrestore some dependability that climate change has disrupted. Australia is\ncurrently exploring the feasibility of rapidly cooling the Great Barrier Reef\nto prevent its demise.\n\n## Creating risks for neighbors raises conflict alarm\n\nThe climate doesn\u2019t respect national borders. So, a climate engineering\nproject in one country is likely to affect temperature and rainfall in\nneighboring countries. That could be good or bad for crops, water supplies and\nflood risk. It could also have widespread unintended consequences.\n\nSome studies show that a moderate amount of climate engineering would likely\nhave widespread benefits compared with climate change. But not every country\nwould be affected in the same way.\n\nOnce climate engineering is deployed, countries may be more likely to blame\nclimate engineering for extreme events such as hurricanes, floods and\ndroughts, regardless of the evidence.\n\nClimate engineering may spark conflicts among countries, leading to sanctions\nand demands for compensation. Climate change can leave the poorest regions\nmost vulnerable to harm, and climate engineering should not exacerbate that\nharm. Some countries would benefit from climate engineering and thus be more\nresilient to geopolitical strife, and some would be harmed and thus left more\nvulnerable.\n\nIs geoengineering a risk worth taking?\n\nWhile small experiments have been carried out, nobody has conducted large-\nscale climate engineering yet. That means that a lot of information about its\neffects relies on climate models. But while these models are excellent tools\nfor studying the climate system, they\u2019re not good at answering questions about\ngeopolitics and conflict. On top of that, the physical effects of climate\nengineering depend on who is doing it and what they\u2019re doing.\n\n## What\u2019s next?\n\nFor now, there are more questions about climate engineering than answers. It\u2019s\nhard to say whether climate engineering would create more conflict, or if it\ncould defuse international tensions by reducing climate change.\n\nBut international decisions on climate engineering are likely coming soon. At\nthe United Nations Environment Assembly in March 2024, African countries\ncalled for a moratorium on climate engineering, urging all precaution. Other\nnations, including the United States, pressed for a formal scientific group to\nstudy the risks and benefits before making any decisions.\n\nClimate engineering could be part of an equitable solution to climate change.\nBut it also carries risks. Put simply, climate engineering is a technology\nthat can\u2019t be ignored, but more research is needed so policymakers can make\ninformed decisions.\n\n  * Climate change\n  * Food security\n  * Climate\n  * National security\n  * Africa\n  * Science\n  * Geoengineering\n  * Water security\n  * Monsoon\n  * Climate engineering\n  * Solar geoengineering\n  * Paris climate agreement\n  * Small Island States\n  * International norms\n  * US national security\n  * Greenhouse gas emissions (GHG)\n\n### Events\n\nMore events\n\n### Jobs\n\n  * ##### Audience Development Coordinator (fixed-term maternity cover)\n\n  * ##### Data and Reporting Analyst\n\n  * ##### Lecturer (Hindi-Urdu)\n\n  * ##### Director, Defence and Security\n\n  * ##### Opportunities with the new CIEHF\n\nMore jobs\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2010\u20132024, The Conversation Media Group Ltd\n\n", "frontpage": false}
