Through innovative experiments, the team identified two\ndistinct neuronal populations that enable the spinal cord to independently\nadapt and remember movements.\n\nThis groundbreaking work not only provides insight into the spinal cord\u2019s\ncomplex role in movement but also opens new avenues for rehabilitation\nstrategies following spinal injuries. The findings highlight the potential for\nrethinking how movement recovery is approached in patients with spinal damage.\n\nKey Facts:\n\n  1. The spinal cord can learn and remember movements autonomously, thanks to specific dorsal and ventral neuronal populations.\n  2. This discovery was made possible by a novel experimental setup that measures movement changes in mice, offering fresh insights into spinal cord plasticity.\n  3. The research could have significant implications for the rehabilitation of people with spinal injuries, suggesting new methods for enhancing recovery.\n\nSource: VIB\n\nThe role of the spinal cord is often simplified to that of a simple relay\nstation, carrying messages between the brain and the body. However, the spinal\ncord can actually learn and remember movements on its own.\n\nA team of researchers at the Leuven-based Neuro-Electronics Research Flanders\n(NERF) details how two different neuronal populations enable the spinal cord\nto adapt and recall learned behavior in a way that is completely independent\nof the brain.\n\nPart of the problem is the difficulty in directly measuring the activity of\nindividual neurons in the spinal cord in animals that are not sedated but\nawake and moving. Credit: Neuroscience News\n\nThese remarkable findings, published today in Science, shed new light on how\nspinal circuits might contribute to mastering and automating movement. The\ninsights could prove relevant in the rehabilitation of people with spinal\ninjuries.\n\n## The spinal cord\u2019s puzzling plasticity\n\nThe spinal cord modulates and finetunes our actions and movements by\nintegrating different sources of sensory information, and it can do so without\ninput from the brain.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, nerve cells in the spinal cord can learn to adjust various tasks\nautonomously, given sufficient repetitive practice. How the spinal cord\nachieves this remarkable plasticity, however, has puzzled neuroscientists for\ndecades.\n\nOne such neuroscientist is Professor Aya Takeoka. Her team at Neuro-\nElectronics Research Flanders (NERF, a research institute backed by imec, KU\nLeuven and VIB) studies how the spinal cord recovers from injuries by\nexploring how the nerve connections are wired, and how they function and\nchange when we learn new movements.\n\n\u201cAlthough we have evidence of \u2018learning\u2019 within the spinal cord from\nexperiments dating back as early as the beginning of the 20th century, the\nquestion of which neurons are involved and how they encode this learning\nexperience has remained unanswered,\u201d says Prof. Takeoka.\n\nPart of the problem is the difficulty in directly measuring the activity of\nindividual neurons in the spinal cord in animals that are not sedated but\nawake and moving. Takeoka\u2019s team took advantage of a model in which animals\ntrain specific movements within minutes. In doing so, the team uncovered a\ncell type-specific mechanism of spinal cord learning.\n\n## Two specific neuronal cell types\n\nTo check how the spinal cord learns, doctoral researcher Simon Lavaud and his\ncolleagues at the Takeoka lab built an experimental setup to measure changes\nin movement in mice, inspired by methods used in insect studies.\n\n\u201cWe evaluated the contribution of six different neuronal populations and\nidentified two groups of neurons, one dorsal and one ventral, that mediate\nmotor learning.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese two sets of neurons take turns,\u201d explains Lavaud. \u201cThe dorsal neurons\nhelp the spinal cord learn a new movement, while the ventral neurons help it\nremember and perform the movement later.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can compare it to a relay race within the spinal cord. The dorsal neurons\nact like the first runner, passing on the critical sensory information for\nlearning. Then, the ventral cells take the baton, ensuring the learned\nmovement is remembered and executed smoothly.\u201d\n\n## Learning and memory outside the brain\n\nThe detailed results, published in this week\u2019s edition of Science, illustrate\nthat neuronal activity in the spinal cord resembles various classical types of\nlearning and memory. Further unravelling these learning mechanisms will be\ncrucial, as they likely contribute to different ways in which we learn and\nautomate movement, and may also be relevant in the context of rehabilitation,\nsays Prof. Aya Takeoka:\n\n\u201cThe circuits we described could provide the means for the spinal cord to\ncontribute to movement learning and long-term motor memory, which both help us\nto move, not only in normal health but especially during recovery from brain\nor spinal cord injuries.\u201d\n\nFunding: The research (team) was supported by the Research Foundation Flanders\n(FWO), Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie Actions (MSCA), a Taiwan-KU Leuven PhD\nfellowship (P1040), and the Wings for Life Spinal Cord Research Foundation.\n\n## About this learning and memory research news\n\nAuthor: India Jane Wise Source: VIB Contact: India Jane Wise \u2013 VIB Image: The\nimage is credited to Neuroscience News\n\nOriginal Research: Closed access. \u201cTwo inhibitory neuronal classes govern\nacquisition and recall of spinal sensorimotor adaptation\u201d by Aya Takeoka et\nal. Science\n\nAbstract\n\nTwo inhibitory neuronal classes govern acquisition and recall of spinal\nsensorimotor adaptation\n\nSpinal circuits are central to movement adaptation, yet the mechanisms within\nthe spinal cord responsible for acquiring and retaining behavior upon\nexperience remain unclear.\n\nUsing a simple conditioning paradigm, we found that dorsal inhibitory neurons\nare indispensable for adapting protective limb-withdrawal behavior by\nregulating the transmission of a specific set of somatosensory information to\nenhance the saliency of conditioning cues associated with limb position.\n\nBy contrast, maintaining previously acquired motor adaptation required the\nventral inhibitory Renshaw cells. Manipulating Renshaw cells does not affect\nthe adaptation itself but flexibly alters the expression of adaptive behavior.\n\nThese findings identify a circuit basis involving two distinct populations of\nspinal inhibitory neurons, which enables lasting sensorimotor adaptation\nindependently from the brain.\n\nTags\n\nbrain researchlearningMemorymovementneurobiologyNeurologyNeurosciencespinal\ncordVIB\n\nShareTweetShareShareSubmitEmail\n\nNeuroscience News\n\nNeuroscience News posts science research news from labs, universities,\nhospitals and news departments around the world.
