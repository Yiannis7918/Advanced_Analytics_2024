Overall,\nabout half of the participants reported co-sleeping with pets \u2013 defined in our\nstudy as sleeping in the same room with your pet for at least part of the\nnight.\n\nNext, our research team compared the sleep habits of people who did and didn\u2019t\nco-sleep with pets. Our analyses revealed that participants who co-slept with\npets had poorer sleep quality and more insomnia symptoms than those who did\nnot. These findings persisted even after accounting for demographic\ndifferences between these groups. When considering pet type, we found evidence\nfor a negative effect on sleep when co-sleeping with dogs but no evidence for\na negative effect on sleep when co-sleeping with cats.\n\nCats may have less of a negative effect on sleep than dogs when sharing the\nsame room with their owners.

Although more research is needed, these findings could suggest that\nmost people are unaware of the potential negative effects their pets may have\non their sleep.\n\n## Why it matters\n\nMost pet owners report that their pets have a generally positive effect on\ntheir mental health. Pets can improve their owners\u2019 health in numerous ways\nduring the day, such as by encouraging physical activity, promoting a daily\nroutine and providing love and companionship.\n\nHowever, our study fills an important knowledge gap by indicating that co-\nsleeping with pets can affect sleep quality. Good sleep is a pillar of health\nand wellness. Even though pets may have an overall positive effect on mental\nhealth, it is possible that some of this benefit may be undermined if they are\nalso causing you to lose sleep at night.\n\nAlthough some people report that co-sleeping with their pets can provide them\nwith a sense of comfort or intimacy, it is important for people sharing a\nbedroom with their pets to be aware of their potential to serve as a source of\nnighttime noise, heat or movement that can disrupt your ability to fall or\nstay asleep.\n\n## What still isn\u2019t known\n\nSurvey-based studies like ours are unable to prove that co-sleeping with pets\ncauses disrupted sleep, although there is some evidence suggesting that this\ncould be the case.\n\nOne important factor that our study did not assess was whether participants\nwere also co-sleeping with other people like a spouse or child. Previous\nresearch suggests that sharing a bed with other people can also affect our\nsleep and that the mental health benefits of pet ownership could be stronger\nfor people with a romantic partner.\n\nPets provide many health benefits during the day, but consider keeping them\nout of your bed at night.

So, what should someone do to improve their sleep if they already\nshare a bed with their pets?\n\nSome expert tips include choosing a mattress that is large enough for you and\nyour pets, washing and changing your bedding regularly, and establishing and\nmaintaining a consistent bedtime routine with your pets. Further research is\nneeded to identify more specific habits and routines that pet owners can adopt\nto ensure a good night\u2019s sleep when sharing the bedroom with their pets.\n\nThe Research Brief is a short take about interesting academic work.\n\n  * Sleep\n  * Pets\n  * Cats\n  * Animals\n  * Dogs\n  * Insomnia\n  * Pets and human health\n  * Quick reads\n  * Sleep problems\n  * Sleep hygiene\n  * Sleep quality\n  * Research Brief\n\n### Events\n\nMore events\n\n### Jobs\n\n  * ##### Faculty of Law - Academic Appointment Opportunities\n\n  * ##### Operations Manager\n\n  * ##### Senior Education Technologist\n\n  * ##### Audience Development Coordinator (fixed-term maternity cover)\n\n  * ##### Lecturer (Hindi-Urdu)\n\nMore jobs\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2010\u20132024, The Conversation Media Group Ltd\n\n", "frontpage": false}
