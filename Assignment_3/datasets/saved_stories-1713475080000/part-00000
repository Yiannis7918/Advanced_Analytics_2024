While some cereals aimed at older toddlers\ncontain added sugar, there is none in products targeted at babies between six\nmonths and one year.\n\nLaurent Gaberell, Public Eye\u2019s agriculture and nutrition expert, said: \u201cNestl\u00e9\nmust put an end to these dangerous double standards and stop adding sugar in\nall products for children under three years old, in every part of the world.\u201d\n\nObesity is increasingly a problem in low- and middle-income countries. In\nAfrica, the number of overweight children under five has increased by nearly\n23% since 2000, according to the World Health Organization. Globally, more\nthan 1 billion people are living with obesity.\n\nIt is not always easy for consumers in any country to tell whether a product\ncontains added sugar, and how much is present, based on nutritional\ninformation printed on packaging alone. Labels often include naturally\noccurring sugars in milk and fruit under the same heading as any added sugars.\n\nWHO guidelines for the European region say no added sugars or sweetening\nagents should be permitted in any food for children under three. While no\nguidance has been specifically produced for other regions, researchers say the\nEuropean document remains equally relevant to other parts of the world.\n\nCerelac on sale in a British supermarket.

US government\nguidelines recommend avoiding foods and drinks with added sugars for those\nyounger than two.\n\nIn its report, written in collaboration with the International Baby Food\nAction Network, Public Eye said data from Euromonitor International, a market-\nresearch company, revealed global retail sales of above $1bn (\u00a3800m) for\nCerelac. The highest figures are in low- and middle-income countries, with 40%\nof sales just in Brazil and India.\n\nDr Nigel Rollins, a medical officer at the WHO, said the findings represented\n\u201ca double standard [...] that can\u2019t be justified\u201d.\n\nBiscuit-flavoured cereals for babies aged six months and older contained 6g of\nadded sugar for every serving in Senegal and South Africa, researchers found.\nThe same product sold in Switzerland has none.\n\nTests on Cerelac products sold in India showed, on average, more than 2.7g of\nadded sugar for every serving.\n\nIn Brazil, where Cerelac is known as Mucilon, two out of eight products were\nfound to have no added sugar but the other six contained nearly 4g for each\nserving. In Nigeria, one product tested had up to 6.8g .\n\nMeanwhile, tests on products from the Nido brand, which has worldwide retail\nsales of more than $1bn, revealed significant variation in sugar levels.\n\nIn the Philippines, products aimed at toddlers contain no added sugar.\nHowever, in Indonesia, Nido baby-food products, sold as Dancow, all contained\nabout 2g of added sugar per 100g of product in the form of honey, or 0.8g a\nserving.\n\nIn Mexico, two of the three Nido products available for toddlers contained no\nadded sugar, but the third contained 1.7g per serving. Nido Kinder 1+ products\nsold in South-Africa, Nigeria and Senegal all contained nearly 1g per serving,\nthe report said.\n\nGlobal health and environmental costs of food industry are $10tn a year \u2013 UN\n\nRead more\n\nA Nestl\u00e9 spokesperson said: \u201cWe believe in the nutritional quality of our\nproducts for early childhood and prioritise using high-quality ingredients\nadapted to the growth and development of children.\u201d\n\nShe said that within the \u201chighly regulated\u201d category of baby food, Nestl\u00e9\nalways complied \u201cwith local regulations or international standards, including\nlabelling requirements and thresholds on carbohydrate content that encompasses\nsugars\u201d and declared total sugars in its products, including those coming from\nhoney.\n\nVariations in recipes depended on factors including regulation and\navailability of local ingredients, she said.\n\nThe company has reduced the total amount of added sugars in its infant cereals\nportfolio by 11% worldwide over the past decade, she said, and continued to\nreformulate products to reduce them further.\n\nSucrose and glucose syrup were being phased out of \u201cgrowing-up milks\u201d aimed at\ntoddlers worldwide, she added.\n\nThis article was amended on 17 April 2024 to correct sales figures supplied by\nPublic Eye. Nido has worldwide sales of more than $1bn, not $4.1bn, and\nCerelac $1bn, not $1.2bn, as an earlier version said.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Global development\n  * Nestl\u00e9\n  * Food & drink industry\n  * Switzerland\n  * Africa\n  * Asia Pacific\n  * Global health\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
