Since some friends have asked me about the switch \u2014 \u201cNow that\nyou work at Zed, are you using Zed instead of Vim?\u201d \u2014 I thought I\u2019d write\nabout it. You now know that I did switch, yes, so what\u2019s left to talk about is\nthe Why.\n\nBefore we do that, though, let me make something clear: I love Vim and Neovim.\nI\u2019ve used Vim professionally, intensely, admiringly, loudly (guess that\u2019s why\npeople ask me whether I switched) for the last 13 years. I wrote a blog post\nabout getting better at Vim 12 years ago and haven\u2019t lost interest since. 5\nyears ago I switched to Neovim. Discovering what Neovim and its community had\nto offer brought me a lot of joy. I got my 10000 hours in Vim.\n\n\u201cOkay, we get it: you used to use Vim and you\u2019re old\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s right. But I\nhave to tell you all of this, since I wrote about testing before and put a\nparagraph with credentials in it and people still thought I just hadn\u2019t\nwritten enough tests yet.\n\nSo, let me say it again, in a second paragraph: I love Vim, I know Vim, I\u2019m\nvery good at Vim. I can hear Drew Neil\u2019s accent when I close my eyes. I know\nwho my pope is. I remember when Derek said \u201cVim the Wonder Horse\u201d. I\u2019ve\nlearned Vim tricks from Gary Bernhardt. I was there when TJ read the Vim\nmanual. I live on home row. I once spent a Christmas vacation reading through\nthe Best Vim Tips back when it was a single .txt file on vim.org. Others leave\n:w lying around, I twitch vapgq when writing prose. Grown-ups I brought to\ntears with my use of Vim macros. It\u2019s not clear whether it was awestruck-\nweeping or \u201cjust stop and do this by hand so we can move on\u201d-weeping, but that\nshall not matter for this discussion.\n\nWhat\u2019s hopefully clear now is that I don\u2019t switch editors lightly. Yet I did.\nWhy?\n\nLet\u2019s start with the obvious, even though it\u2019s more a requirement than a\nreason: Zed has a Vim mode. Without that, I wouldn\u2019t have switched. But what\u2019s\nintriguing to me, what lured me to Zed, is that its Vim mode is composable\nwith the rest of Zed. And Zed has a lot of things I\u2019ve always been curious\nabout: multi-cursors, multi-selections, undo/redo stack for selections,... In\nZed, I can use them all while also using Vim motions and operators. Imagine,\nas I did: the powers of a Vim mode combined with multi-cursors, multi-\nselections? That\u2019s what got my curiosity. (Conversely, that\u2019s also why I find\nthe idea of just embedding Neovim into Zed a bit boring. In my eyes, it would\nmake Zed just another GUI wrapper.)\n\nUsing `cmd-d` to create multiple selections and combining it with Vim motions\n\nThen there\u2019s the multi-buffer. Oh, the multi-buffer. What a thing of beauty.\nIn short: the multi-buffer allows you to view multiple excerpts from multiple\nbuffers (files) in a single tab and (here\u2019s the amazing part) edit them as if\nthey were all in the same file! Yes! You can search for my_dumb_typo or find\nall references of a variable or find all implementations of an interface and\nthe results all get displayed in a multi-buffer and in the multi-buffer you\ncan edit all of the excerpts! It\u2019s glorious. Vim users: imagine if you could\nedit the quickfix list. Emacs users: yes, you already know this and call it\nOccur mode, thanks for tuning in.\n\nThe multi-buffer in action: I\u2019m editing two files in the same tab.\n\nMulti-cursor, multi-buffer, multi-selection, in combination with a Vim Mode \u2014\nthe powers seem endless. How could I not try that?\n\nTo linger on the practical matters before switching to the abstract: yes, I\nwork at Zed, that\u2019s also a reason for why I use it. Would I use it even if I\ndidn\u2019t work there? Yes, I did, before I joined Zed. Now I use Zed because I\nwork on Zed, I work on Zed because I used Zed and found it very interesting.\nPulling this apart into hypotheticals seems pointless. What I can tell you is\nthat I wouldn\u2019t work at Zed without using it \u2014 that seems hypothetically\nabsurd to me. (Would I write this post if I didn\u2019t work there? Yes,\nabsolutely. Do I work there because I\u2019m the type of guy who writes blog posts\nabout switching editors?)\n\nNow, as for the abstract that made me try it out and switch and makes me keep\nusing it: the values behind Zed \u2014 the editor & the team \u2014 overlap with my own.\nPerformance, simplicity, focus, aesthethics, love for the craft \u2014 that\u2019s what\nI saw when I first used it and what resonated with me. Whether the founders\nwould sign off on this list I\u2019m not sure about, but does it matter? Sometimes\nyou use software and it\u2019s as if you\u2019re walking past a bar, hear music coming\nout of it, and you immediately start to nod your hear \u2014 do you go in, or go\nhome and listen to the same music you\u2019ve always been listening to?\n\n\u201cBut, Thorsten, values schmalues \u2014 what I want to know: does it support Vim\nmacros, registers, marks, does it have jumplist? What about those rainbow\nparentheses?\u201d \u2014 it supports some of these, will support a lot of the others,\nmight never have 100% feature compatibility with Neovim. But, I have to admit,\nI don\u2019t care that much. I need it to feel 90% Vimmy so I don\u2019t curse, but\nwhat\u2019s more important than getting the other 10% to me is that it\u2019s something\nnew.\n\nI try out and sometimes even switch to new tools on a regular basis. Why?\nBecause you\u2019ll never know what you\u2019ll find and very often there is something\ninteresting to be learned, or to be adapted into your old workflow.\n\nHere\u2019s some examples. Until a few years ago I didn\u2019t use any autocomplete,\nonly Vim\u2019s filename completion. Then I tried language servers and autocomplete\nand now I can\u2019t live without it. Inlay hints \u2014 first time I saw them in VS\nCode, had to try it out when writing Rust, ended up writing Rust in VS Code\nfor a few months purely because of inlay hints, then switched back to Neovim\nwhen inlay hints landed there, and now I\u2019m convinced inlay hints are a game\nchanger in developer tooling. This year I also ditched tmux from my regular\nsetup, purely because I wanted to know what it\u2019s like to use Ghostty without\ntmux in the middle, to get more performance out of it. Back in 2017, I flirted\nwith Emacs and still think of the ideas I found on a regular basis.\n\nSo there you go, I switched because Zed has a Vim mode, there\u2019s some very\nintriguing text editing mechanics in it, because its values resonate with,\nbecause I wanted to try something new.\n\nDo I still use Vim? Yes, for some config files, or when I want to edit a\ndirectory using oil.nvim, but my main editor for programming is Zed. There\u2019s a\nlot to learn.\n\nIf you too describe using new text editors as \u201cflirting\u201d, subscribe here:\n\n31 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n1 Restack\n\n31\n\nShare this post\n\n#### From Vim to Zed\n\nregisterspill.thorstenball.com\n\n6\n\nShare\n\n6 Comments\n\nKristian QuirapasKristian\u2019s SubstackApr 5One of the best things I love about\nvim/neovim is that migration to new machines or ssh server manipulations\naren't hard.But I can imagine that if Zed has vim mode.
