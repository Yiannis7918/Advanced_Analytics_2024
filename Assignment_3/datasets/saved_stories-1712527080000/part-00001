Known as the A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b, it contained\n4,000 s\u016btras, or rules, for writing classical Sanskrit. The extensive work\nalso distinguishes between how the language should be expressed colloquially\nor when reciting sacred texts.\n\nTo put that in perspective for a modern, English-speaking audience, the\nA\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b is what you would get if William Strunk Jr. and E.B. White\u2019s The\nElements of Style was an eight-volume tome designed to not only dole out\nadvice but offered meticulous instruction for crafting any word or sentence in\nthe language. (Fortunately for English 101 students the world over, Strunk and\nWhite\u2019s efforts were less extensive.)\n\nAlthough P\u0101\u1e47ini had his predecessors, his work is the oldest surviving example\nof a complete linguistic text. Its influence on modern linguists, such as\nFerdinand de Saussure, has led some to honor P\u0101\u1e47ini as the \u201cfather of\nlinguistics.\u201d\n\nNot long after P\u0101\u1e47ini produced his masterwork, scholars did what they do best:\nThey argued over how to best interpret it. The intervening centuries of\nscholarly debate generated a convoluted lineage of explanations for\nunderstanding the A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b \u2014 and in doing so, how we should read classical\nSanskrit.\n\nMore than 2,500 years later, a University of Cambridge Ph.D. student, Rishi\nRajpopat, may have solved the mystery of how to use P\u0101\u1e47ini\u2019s language machine\naccurately.\n\nThe page of the A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b was written on palm-leaf paper. (Credit: Sarah\nWelch/Wikimedia Commons).\n\n## An ancient language machine\n\nBefore discussing Rajpopat\u2019s solution, it\u2019s worth considering what exactly is\nmeant by \u201clanguage machine.\u201d P\u0101\u1e47ini\u2019s treatise isn\u2019t meant to just describe\nclassical Sanskrit or prescribe usage like a fussy language arts teacher. It\u2019s\ndesigned to help its readers generate \u201cflawless\u201d Sanskrit.\n\nAlthough the Indian subcontinent has produced many writing systems \u2014 historian\nSteven Roger Fischer calls it \u201cthe world\u2019s richest treasury of scripts\u201d \u2014 it\nalso maintains a strong oral tradition. The Brahmins, India\u2019s priestly class,\nlong considered speech superior to writing. Even centuries after the Indians\nadopted writing, the Brahmins continued to pass down the hymns of the Vedas,\nHinduism\u2019s oldest four sacred texts, orally.\n\nThis tradition meant the desire to use language correctly wasn\u2019t simply a\nmatter of avoiding an embarrassing correction in the comments section. It was\nof the utmost religious consequence.\n\nWith the A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b, P\u0101\u1e47ini didn\u2019t only want to teach the language. He aimed\nto protect Hinduism\u2019s sacred texts from corruption. He built a system of\noperations that allowed a reader to combine base words and affixes to generate\nproper word forms. The user could then combine those words to construct\nimpeccable sentences. All readers had to do was follow the instructions.\n\nEffectively, he created an analog algorithm that would produce the same\nSanskrit word, sentence, and hymn each time \u2014 preserving the language and\nsettling disputes over correct usage for time immemorial.\n\n## An enigma in the machine\n\nIf only.\n\nUnfortunately for later scholars, P\u0101\u1e47ini\u2019s style is succinct, economical, and\nintricately self-referential. Preceding rules affect later rules in the\noperation but without explicitly stating so. As Rajpopat writes in his Ph.D.\nthesis: \u201cThere is no universal convention as to which terms are supposed to or\ncan become [continued] into a certain rule.\u201d\n\nThese stylistic choices make the A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b shorter and easier to memorize\nthan it would be otherwise \u2014 some historians believe it was initially composed\norally \u2014 but also incredibly dense. That density leads to rule conflicts, in\nwhich two rules may apply simultaneously to the same word yet produce\ndifferent outcomes.\n\nP\u0101\u1e47ini did provide a meta-rule to solve such conflicts. According to\ntraditional scholarship, this meta-rule states that \u201cin the event of a\nconflict between two rules of equal strength, the rule that comes later in the\nserial order of the A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b wins.\u201d\n\nSeems simple enough. But when applied, this meta-rule yields many exceptions.\nTo correct those exceptions, scholars have for centuries created their own\nmeta-rules. However, those meta-rules yielded even more exceptions, which\nrequired the creation of additional meta-rules (meta-meta-rules?). Those meta-\nrules in turn created even more exceptions \u2014 and you see where this is going.\n\nDr. Rishi Rajpopat solved the grammatical problem of P\u0101\u1e47ini\u2019s metarule and\npublished the results in his Ph.D. thesis. (Credit: Cambridge University\nLibrary)\n\n## One meta-rule to rule them all\n\nWhile working on his thesis, Rajpopat decided that this meta morass could not\nhave been what P\u0101\u1e47ini intended with the A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b. \u201cP\u0101\u1e47ini had an\nextraordinary mind and he built a machine unrivaled in human history. He\ndidn\u2019t expect us to add new ideas to his rules. The more we fiddle with\nP\u0101\u1e47ini\u2019s grammar, the more it eludes us,\u201d Rajpopat said in a press release.\n\nRajpopat returned to P\u0101\u1e47ini\u2019s original meta-rule and considered it with a\nfresh lens. When he found a rule conflict, rather than give preference to the\nlater rule in serial order, he deferred to the word that came later in the\nsentence. Because Sanskrit is written left to right, that meant applying the\nrule appropriate to the word on the right.\n\nAn example shared by Rajpopat is the sentence \u201cdev\u0101\u1e25 prasann\u0101\u1e25 mantrai\u1e25\u201d (\u201cThe\nGods are pleased by the mantras\u201d). Rajpopat notes that a rule conflict arises\nwhen trying to derive the word mantraih (\u201cby the mantras\u201d). One rule applies\nto the left word, mantra, and another to the right word, bhis. By applying his\ninterpretation of the meta-rule, he followed the rule for bhis and arrived at\nthe correct form of mantraih.\n\nSubscribe for counterintuitive, surprising, and impactful stories delivered to\nyour inbox every Thursday\n\nRajpopat\u2019s research looked at many other rule conflicts, and thorough textual\nevidence shows that the meta-rule results in the correct form time and again.\nThis potentially makes it possible to construct millions of grammatically\ncorrect classical Sanskrit texts.\n\n\u201c[Rajpopat] has found an extraordinarily elegant solution to a problem which\nhas perplexed scholars for centuries. This discovery will revolutionize the\nstudy of Sanskrit at a time when interest in the language is on the rise,\u201d\nVincenzo Vergiani, a professor of Asian and Middle Eastern studies at\nCambridge, said in the same release.\n\nA sage idol of P\u0101\u1e47ini found at Panini Tapobhumi, Arghakhanchi.

Throughout India\u2019s\nhistory, works of poetry, philosophy, mathematics, and literature have been\nwritten in the script. By solving this grammatical problem, Rajpopat has given\nmodern scholars a fresh means to interpret and understand this wealth of human\nachievement.\n\nAnd now unlocked, Panini\u2019s ancient algorithm could also potentially be taught\nto computers. This may not only improve the accuracy of modern translations\nbut dramatically increase the speed at which such scholarship can be\nundertaken.\n\n\u201cSome of the most ancient wisdom of India has been produced in Sanskrit, and\nwe still don\u2019t fully understand what our ancestors achieved. We\u2019ve often been\nled to believe that we\u2019re not important, that we haven\u2019t brought enough to the\ntable. I hope this discovery will infuse students in India with confidence,\npride, and hope that they too can achieve great things,\u201d Rajpopat said.\n\nTags\n\nClassic Literatureculturehistoryproblem solving\n\nIn this article\n\nClassic Literatureculturehistoryproblem solving\n\nRelated\n\nHigh Culture\n\nThe secret history of 7 common words\n\nHow drugs, demons, and the search for immortality gave us words we use\neveryday.\n\nLife\n\nThe unknown linguistic laws that apply to all life\n\nLinguistic laws are remarkably versatile and have applications in ecology,\nmicrobiology, epidemiology, demographics, and geography.\n\nStrange Maps\n\nDerinkuyu: Mysterious underground city in Turkey found in man\u2019s basement\n\nA basement renovation project led to the archaeological discovery of a\nlifetime: the Derinkuyu Underground City, which housed 20,000 people.\n\nThinking\n\n7 essential Eastern philosophy books\n\nDiscover the holistic and all-encompassing philosophies of the ancient East.\n\nThinking\n\n10 Indian Thinkers and Why You Should Know Them.\n\nIndia is a vast land, rich in history, beauty, and great ideas.
