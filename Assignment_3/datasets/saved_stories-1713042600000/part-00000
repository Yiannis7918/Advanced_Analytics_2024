In this work, we demonstrate\nthe passive, diamagnetic levitation of a centimeter-sized massive oscillator,\nwhich is fabricated using a method that ensures that the material, though\nhighly diamagnetic, is an electrical insulator. Electrical conductors moving\nin a magnetic field experience eddy damping\u2014which can severely reduce their\nmotional quality factor. By chemically coating a powder of microscopic\ngraphite beads with silica and embedding the coated powder in high-vacuum\ncompatible wax, we form a centimeter-sized thin square plate which\nmagnetically levitates over a checkerboard magnet array. The insulating\ncoating reduces eddy damping by almost an order of magnitude compared to\nuncoated graphite with the same particle size. These plates exhibit a\ndifferent equilibrium orientation from pyrolytic graphite due to their\nisotropic magnetic susceptibility. We measure the motional quality factor to\nbe for an approximately centimeter-sized composite resonator with a mean\nparticle size of 12 \u03bcm. Furthermore, we apply delayed feedback to cool the\nvertical motion of frequency and achieve center-of-mass temperature decrease\nby three orders of magnitude.\n\nTopics\n\nMagnetic energy, Electrical insulator, Magnetic potential, Sensors, Magnetic\nlevitation devices, Feedback control system, Diamagnetic materials, Magnetic\nmaterials, Magnetic susceptibility, Carbon based materials\n\nOptomechanical systems are the most precise measuring devices in existence,\nmost notably the LIGO gravitational wave observatory which can measure\ndistortions in spacetime 10 000 smaller than a proton. Tabletop systems aim to\nexploit the versatile optomechanical interaction to design compact classical\nand quantum sensors. Optomechanical systems are fundamentally limited by\nthermal noise from the environment, which interferes with the measurement\nsignal and causes decoherence of fragile quantum states. Levitated\noptomechanics suspends the system without any physical connection to the\nenvironment. The resulting exquisite isolation means that the quantum ground\nstate of its harmonically confined motion can be attained at room temperature\nusing feedback-cooling.^1 This is promising for both high-precision laboratory\nmeasurements and deployment in noisy real-world settings.^2,3 Levitation also\nleads to a natural coupling with gravity. Thus, levitated systems are natural\ntestbeds for probing some of the deepest outstanding questions in physics,\nsuch as quantum gravity and gravity-induced wavefunction collapse\nmechanisms.^4\n\nDiamagnetic levitation of graphite slabs offers a unique platform for\nlevitated optomechanics. Most levitated platforms use active methods, such as\noptical tweezers or Paul traps. These use time-varying optical or\nelectromagnetic fields^2,3 and can trap particles of nano- and micro-meter\nsizes. In contrast diamagnetic levitation is passive, and centimeter-sized\nslabs of graphite can be easily levitated above an array of commercially\navailable permanent magnets.^5\u20139 This removes the noise associated with an\nactive power source.^10 Moreover, the lowered power and hardware requirements\nare promising for developing commercial sensors. Diamagnetic levitation can\nalso support much larger masses than traditional levitated optomechanics. More\nmassive systems have greater sensitivity for accelerometry and\ngravimetry^11,12 and are crucial to explore the behavior of quantum physics at\nlarger scales. The large mass, ease of use, and passive nature give graphite\ndiamagnetic levitation a unique status in levitated optomechanics.\n\nThe greatest limiting factor for these systems is eddy damping. Most\nexperiments use highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), a synthetic\nmaterial consisting of layered planes of graphite. This has a very strong\ndiamagnetic susceptibility along the axis perpendicular to the graphite\nplanes. However, HOPG is an electrical conductor. As it moves through the\nmagnetic field generated by the magnets, currents are induced along the\ngraphite planes, which cause strong damping. Consequently, the quality factor\nof levitated pyrolytic graphite in vacuum is only several hundred for\nmillimeter-sized slabs and decreases as size increases.^9 Although a thin\ngraphite film has demonstrated sufficient sensitivity to experimentally test\ntheories of dark matter,^13 increasing the quality factor would substantially\nincrease sensitivity and unlock powerful feedback-cooling methods.\n\nIt is, thus, necessary to find methods of suppressing eddy damping in\nlevitated graphite systems. The currents can be disrupted by engineering\nnarrow slits, allowing quality factors of several thousand in vacuum.^14,15 An\nalternative approach has been to use composite materials, consisting of\nmicrometer-sized graphite particles dispersed in an insulating resin.^16 Eddy\ncurrents can only flow within the microparticles or between neighboring\nparticles which happen to touch. In such systems, eddy damping depends only on\nthe size of the particles and is independent of the overall size of the\nresonator. Millimeter-sized slabs of composite graphite attained quality\nfactors of half a million at high vacuum at room temperature, the largest\ndemonstrated for any system of that mass.^16\n\nComposite graphite is, thus, a highly promising system for levitated\noptomechanics. However, it also presents new challenges. Since the magnetic\nsusceptibility of graphite is highly oriented, the random positioning of\nparticles in the composite lowers the effective magnetic susceptibility. The\nsusceptibility further decreases for particle sizes smaller than ,^17 though\nsuch sizes are necessary to significantly suppress eddy currents. Thus, the\nmass that can be supported is decreased, if, for example, we wished to place a\nmirror or other system on the levitated graphite. There is also a limit on the\nvolume fraction of graphite in the material, which was about 40% in Chen et\nal.^16 for reasons of structural integrity. Moreover, the graphite particles\nmust be kept separated by the insulating resin. At high volume fractions, it\nbecomes increasingly likely that neighboring graphite particles will touch,\nallowing eddy currents to flow between them and, thus, decreasing the quality\nfactor.\n\nTo enable large graphite volume fractions while maintaining suppression of\neddy currents, we coat the graphite particles with an insulating shell. Our\ngraphite particles are mesocarbon microbeads (MCMB), whose average diameter is\n. We chemically coat these with a thin insulating layer of silica in a \u201csol-\ngel process\u201d using polyethylene glycol (PEG) and the silica precursor\ntetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS)^18 (see the supplementary material for details\non the fabrication process). First, PEG adsorbs onto the surface of the\nmicrocarbon microbeads. A solution of TEOS and ammonium hydroxide catalyst is\nthen added and stirred for 17 h on a hot plate. During this time, silicon from\nTEOS attaches to the PEG, resulting in a silica coating on the graphite as\nshown in Fig. 1(a). The mixture is then washed, filtered, and dried. Analysis\nusing scanning electron microscopy with elemental mapping shown in Fig. 1(b)\nconfirms the near-uniform coverage of the graphite beads with silica. The\npowder is then mixed in vacuum-compatible wax at a temperature of\napproximately , then cooled, and shaped into small square slabs of approximate\nwidth and thickness . We obtained a graphite mass fraction of , with the\nvolume fraction estimated as . At larger volume fractions, mixing the graphite\npowder into the wax requires significant stirring force, which causes cracking\nof the silica shell.\n\nFIG. 1.\n\nView largeDownload slide\n\nCoated graphite and experimental setup.

In Figs.\n2(a) and 2(b), we show photographs of both pyrolytic and composite graphite,\ntaken from above once their positions had reached equilibrium. We can see that\nthe pyrolytic and composite graphite exhibit different orientations. This\narises from the difference in their magnetic susceptibilities. The potential\nenergy of a diamagnet in a magnetic field is given by\n\n(1)\n\nHere, \u03c7_j are the components of the magnetic susceptibility tensor, B_j are\nthe components of the magnetic field, and \u03bc_0 is the vacuum permeability. The\nintegral is over the volume of the slab, which depends on its levitation\nheight z and orientation . The susceptibility of pyrolytic graphite is highly\nanisotropic: , and thus, the slab orients itself primarily to avoid the\nz-component of the magnetic field. The composite graphite, on the other hand,\nhas uniform susceptibility and orients itself to avoid all magnetic field\ncomponents equally.^16 We estimate this to be , based on the volume fraction\nof graphite. We plot the magnetic potential energy densities in Figs. 2(c) and\n2(d), which we see accounts for the difference in orientation.\n\nFIG. 2.\n\nView largeDownload slide\n\nRe-orientation of diamagnetic slabs for HOPG (left) and composite graphite\n(right).

Note that (c)\u2013(f) are individually normalized, so the color\nscale cannot be directly compared between plots.\n\nClose modal\n\nWe can further study the difference between the two materials by evaluating\nthe total potential energy, which is the sum of the magnetic and gravitational\ncomponents. We graph this for pyrolytic and composite graphite in Figs. 2(e)\nand 2(f), which clearly show the difference in orientation. We can see that\nthe composite graphite experiences a much looser angular confinement. The\ncomposite also levitates at smaller heights as compared to the HOPG. There are\nseveral effects which contribute to the different levitation height, namely,\nthe lower effective susceptibility of the composite, its graphite mass\nfraction of 57%, and the density of the wax. These factors also influence the\nshape of the trap, as we discuss further in the supplementary material.\n\nWe note that these observations seem to disagree with those of Chen et al.,^16\nwhich reported composite resonators to orient themselves similarly to\npyrolytic graphite. A more detailed analysis in our supplementary material\ndoes not find a regime where such orientation is expected. One likely\nexplanation is the geometry of the magnets. In our experiment shown in Figs.\n2(a) and 2(b), the chamfering is small compared to the size of the magnets and\ngraphite slabs; hence, we assumed the magnets to be perfect cubes in our\nanalysis. However, in Chen et al. their magnets show significant chamfering,\ncomparable to the size of their composite slabs. Given how shallow the\ncomposite potential is in Fig. 2(f), it is likely that this could be distorted\nby such changes to the magnet geometry. Another explanation could be that some\nunknown factor is causing slight orientation of the particles in their\ncomposite.\n\nThe composite's trapped dynamics were characterized using the setup shown in\nFig. 1(c). The insulating resonator is levitated by an alternating polarity\ncheckerboard magnet array made up of four NdFeB magnets. They are rigidly held\nwithin a holder that is mounted on a small optical breadboard. The breadboard\nitself sits on four vibration isolation supports. The velocity and\ndisplacement of the resonator are monitored by an interferometric displacement\nsensor (SmarAct PICOSCALE Interferometer). It is based on a compact Michelson\ninterferometer and enables high-precision measurement of the position (and\nusing numerical differentiation, also the velocity), in real time with a\nresolution of picometers at a high bandwidth. The sensor of the PICOSCALE is\nfixed to a five-axis ultra-high vacuum-compatible motorized stage. The whole\nstructure is placed in a vacuum chamber, which is evacuated by a system\nconsisting of a turbopump, an associated roughing pump, and an ion pump.\nDuring the measurement periods, the turbopump is switched off to avoid\nmechanical vibrations, while the ion pump operates continuously to maintain a\nhigh vacuum. To isolate the setup from vibrations, the vacuum chamber and ion\npump are supported by a damped and vibration-isolated optical table, and the\nturbopump is supported by a separate vibration-damped and isolated platform.\nThe insulating resonator levitates above a checkerboard of four permanent\nmagnets, with a small mirror placed on top of the slab in order to read out\nits position and velocity with a PICOSCALE interferometer. This setup is most\nsensitive to the slab's vertical oscillation, whose frequency is observed to\nbe . This frequency matches simulations of the potential in Fig. 2(d). We\nactuate the system using a coil situated just above the graphite. A current\nflowing through this coil generates a magnetic field along its vertical axis,\nwhich perturbs the field generated by the magnets and, thus, exerts a force on\nthe graphite. As discussed in the supplementary material, the force exerted by\nthe coil depends only on the magnitude of the applied voltage, not its sign.\nWhen applying voltage signals to the coil, we, thus, operate around a DC\nshift, allowing us to apply both positive and negative forces. When performing\nmeasurement at high vacuum only the ion pump is left on, allowing us to\nmaintain vacuum while minimizing vibrations. We refer to the supplementary\nmaterial for further details on the setup.\n\nTo study the eddy damping in our composite resonator, we drive the vertical\nmode using the coil close to the resonance frequency of and then measure the\nringdown at a pressure of for , as shown in Fig. 3. The velocity of a damped\nresonator decays exponentially as , where f_0 is the natural frequency of the\nvertical mode. By fitting the envelope of measured velocity, we find the\nquality factor of vertical mode for the square composite plate.\n\nFIG. 3.\n\nView largeDownload slide\n\nRingdown of the composite graphite resonator at a pressure of .

This is almost an\norder of magnitude smaller than the damping rate for other graphite composites\nwith similar particle sizes ( ).^16 This demonstrates that the insulating\nsilica shell is effectively suppressing eddy currents between neighboring\ngraphite particles.\n\nFIG. 3.\n\nView largeDownload slide\n\nRingdown of the composite graphite resonator at a pressure of .

Moreover, the damping rate is almost one order of\nmagnitude lower than that of the composite with the same particle size\nmeasured in Ref. 16 (see the supplementary material for a detailed\ncomparison). This demonstrates that the insulating silica shell is indeed\nsuppressing the flow of eddy currents between neighboring graphite particles,\nleading to almost an order of magnitude increase in quality factor.\n\nOptomechanical applications of graphite composites will invariably require\nfeedback cooling.^19 Aided by the electromagnetic coil above the levitated\nresonator, we apply feedback forces to cool the vertical motion. The feedback\nsignal is generated from the real-time measured velocity by a Red Pitaya FPGA.\nTo suppress noise and isolate the vertical mode, the velocity is bandpass\nfiltered using a finite impulse response (FIR) filter. The filter and\nelectronics have an intrinsic delay which we find to be approximately 7.6\nperiods of the oscillation signal. The FPGA, thus, also applies a variable\ntime delay, allowing us to make sure velocity feedback is applied with the\ncorrect phase relative to the composite's motion. The signal from the FPGA is\nthen amplified and applied to the coils. Further details on the feedback\nscheme are provided in the supplementary material.\n\nFor theoretical analysis, we approximate the vertical motion as a one-\ndimensional harmonic oscillator with a thermal drive. This approximation\nshould be valid for small oscillations, where coupling to other motional modes\nshould not be significant. Considering the velocity feedback, the equation of\nmotion is\n\n(2)\n\nwhere dots denote the time derivative. The vertical position of the oscillator\nis given by x. The oscillator has resonant frequency , damping rate \u03b3, and\nmass m. The temperature of the thermal bath is T, and k_B is Boltzmann's\nconstant. The bath is modeled as Gaussian white noise , with autocorrelation .\nThe feedback strength is given by , which is applied with some time delay \u03c4.\nThis corresponds to a feedback force of . In the supplementary material, we\nshow that this has power spectral density\n\n(3)\n\nThis formula is valid when , where f_0 is the oscillator frequency and n is an\ninteger. In this regime, the time-delay is such that the applied feedback\nopposes the system's velocity. Otherwise the feedback acts to amplify the\nvelocity, causing unbounded heating of the system.\n\nTo characterize the effectiveness of feedback in this system, we performed\ndelayed velocity feedback cooling experiments at moderate ( ) and low ( )\npressures, with varying time delays and feedback strengths. The measured power\nspectral densities are shown in Fig. 4, which match closely with Eq. (3). We\ndescribe the feedback using feedback strength and dimensionless time delay ,\nwhere f_0 is the natural frequency in the magnetic trap. At moderate\npressures, we can estimate the value of \u03b3 by fitting to the PSD. At low\npressures, the PSD is very narrow, so we estimate \u03b3 using ring-down\nmeasurements. The parameter is fit from the experimental data. For the time\ndelay \u03c4, we first find an approximate value using our measured delay and the\nmanual delay added by the FPGA and then fit \u03c4 within one period deviation of\nthis. It is also necessary to fit the overall scale of the PSD. This scale\nfitting accounts for the fact that Eq. (2) models a point particle following\nideal Brownian motion, whereas our system consists of a three-dimensional\nextended plate. Measurements at the moderate pressure took 20 min, while at\nlow pressure, we required 7 h to resolve the peak. As we show in the\nsupplementary material, at low pressure without feedback, the resonance\nfrequency drifts slightly during this time which may be caused by the thermal\nexpansion of the composite plate.\n\nFIG. 4.\n\nView largeDownload slide\n\nPower spectral densities at (a) and (b) moderate pressure and (c) and (d) low\npressure . We parameterize these with the feedback strength (Hz) and\ndimensionless time delay , where f_0 is the natural frequency (Hz). The noisy\ntraces are the experimental data, smoothed using Welch's method. The curves\nare fittings to Eq. (3), which show good agreement with theory. In (a) and\n(c), we fix , respectively, and vary the time delay. In (b) and (d), we fix\nand vary the feedback strength. We note the presence at moderate pressure of\nother modes. Sidelobes appear due to the significant time delay in the system.\nAt low pressure, the peak is significantly narrowed, and feedback cooling is\nable to decrease the temperature by three orders of magnitude. All fitting\nparameters are provided in the supplementary material.\n\nFIG. 4.\n\nView largeDownload slide\n\nPower spectral densities at (a) and (b) moderate pressure and (c) and (d) low\npressure .

All fitting\nparameters are provided in the supplementary material.\n\nClose modal\n\nThe temperature is defined as being proportional to the integrated area under\nthe PSD. We find that cooling is strongest when \u03c4 is an integer number of\nperiods, which from Eq. (2) means that the feedback is directly opposing the\nvelocity. When \u03c4 deviates from an integer value the PSD broadens and the peak\nshifts. At higher pressures with strong feedback strength, the time delay\nleads to visible sidelobes. Increasing the strength of the feedback leads to\nstronger cooling and larger sidelobes at higher pressure. At low pressure,\nwith a time delay of 8 periods and a feedback strength of , we attain three\norders of magnitude decrease in the temperature. We note that Brownian motion\nis typically studied for spherical objects. Brownian motion for non-spherical\nobjects yields shape-dependent anisotropic diffusion,^20 which means that\nestimating the effective mass and absolute motional temperature through is\ndifficult. We do the measurements following extended periods for the system to\nrest, which leads us to suppose that the system without feedback is in thermal\nequilibrium with the environment at and so the minimum temperature could be .\nWe refer to the supplementary material for further discussion of the\nexperimental data and analysis.\n\nIn conclusion, we demonstrate a magnetically levitated centimeter-size\ncomposite resonator by mixing the silica-coated graphite particles with wax.\nThe insulating coating on the graphite prevents eddy currents from flowing\nbetween adjacent particles, significantly reduces eddy damping, and provides a\nroute to engineer larger motional Q-factors. We report the cooling of vertical\nmotional mode at different delays and feedback strengths, with good agreement\nbetween experiment and theory. At suitable feedback conditions, we realize\nstrong cooling of the centimeter-sized resonator by three orders of magnitude\ndecrease in the center-of-mass temperature. In future work, larger Q-factors\ncould be attained by further reducing the graphite particle sizes and using\nfiltering to remove stray large particles. There are also schemes for cooling\nlow frequency resonators further toward their ground state.^21,22 We note that\none does not need to approach the ground state for the demonstrated resonator\nto be useful as a sensor. The acceleration sensitivity of a thermal noise\nlimited resonator can be estimated as .^11 For our massive high-Q resonator at\n, the acceleration sensitivity can reach , which is more precise than research\ngrade atomic gravimeters,^23 the latter which achieve , where g is the\ngravitational acceleration. This work is an initial step toward the\npreparation of quantum states of motion of large objects and shows the\npotential of our composite resonator for fundamental quantum physics and\nultrahigh precision sensing.\n\n## SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL\n\nSee the supplementary material for details of the fabrication and\ncharacterization of the resonators, description of the setup, measurement and\nsimulation of Q factors, theory of orientation of the resonators, theory and\nsimulation of delayed feedback cooling, and measurement and fitting of the\nPSDs.\n\nWe are grateful for the help and support provided by the Scientific Computing\nand Data Analysis Section, the Scientific Imaging Section and the Engineering\nSection at OIST, and T.
