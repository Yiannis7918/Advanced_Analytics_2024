The\ninvestment will accelerate delivery of the company's plans to expand into the\nUS market by opening its first US-based office, recruiting senior US talent,\nenhancing its current product offering for US apparel companies and more. A\ncornerstone of Veesual's US expansion is a new partnership with leading\nwomen's fashion brand EILEEN FISHER. Under the terms of the collaboration,\nVeesual's augmented shopping experiences powered by next-generation virtual\ntry-on technology have been integrated into the EILEEN FISHER online shopping\nexperience.\n\nFounded in 2020, Veesual is on a mission to transform the online shopping\nexperience for all customers, independent of style, fit and fashion\npreferences. Through its Augmented Shopping solutions Mix&Match, Switch Model\nand Look Inspiration, Veesual's proprietary 2D-based Image Generation Engine\n(IGT) was designed specifically for fashion brands to deliver high-quality\nimagery at scale, and to be able to adapt several pieces of clothing on any\nmodel, with natural renderings and precise fitting. Veesual works with leading\nbrands and retailers in Europe including premium (Claudie Pierlot), kids\nfashion (Sergent Major and DPAM), and popular fashion (Le Redoute and Gemo).\n\nWhile brands are working to reflect diversity for e-commerce shoppers by\nfeaturing models of different ethnicities, ages and body types, it can be\nextremely costly to shoot individual products on various models. Veesual's\nSwitch Model experience allows customers to choose a model they identify with\nwhile simultaneously accelerating online sales and reducing returns for\nbrands.\n\n\"We are thrilled to be the first US brand to partner with Veesual on this\ninnovative new virtual try-on tool,\" notes Blair Silverman, Vice President of\nE-commerce at EILEEN FISHER. \"EILEEN FISHER is committed to inclusivity,\ndesigning clothes that cater to every body shape. Navigating online shopping\nposes challenges, particularly in predicting how garments fit diverse body\ntypes. Our collaboration with Veesual addresses these challenges head-on and\nwe are proud to be launching a tool that is sure to be a new standard for\ne-commerce.\"\n\nWhile 3D-based try-on technology can be expensive and time-consuming, 2D image\nsolutions offer a scalable and cost-effective solution for brands that engage\nshoppers. According to recent data published by Insider Intelligence, by 2026\ne-commerce is expected to total over $8.1 trillion and 24% of retail purchases\nare expected to take place online. Veesual enables brands to create a more\nseamless and inclusive shopping experience for customers and in turn, yield\nhigher sales and a lower return rate, allowing them to capture a larger\npercentage of online sales.\n\n\"We are proud to invest in Veesual, in order to accelerate its commercial\nroll-out and pursue its technological developments, as well as its\ninternational expansion,\" said Fran\u00e7ois Robinet, Managing Partner of AVP. \"We\nbelieve in Maxime and his team's vision. They have demonstrated a strong\nability to execute and understand market challenges by offering fashion brands\nsolutions to optimize their customer experience. With a presence on both sides\nof the Atlantic, AVP's teams will be able to support Veesual in the next\nstages of its development.\"\n\nTo support aggressive growth in the US, Veesual is working to recruit more\nsenior talent and will open its first US office in New York in 2025. In\naddition to e-commerce, Veesual aims to create value for brands by displaying\ngenerated images on their acquisition and retargeting channels.\n\n\"The global fashion ecosystem is undergoing a seismic shift right now. The\nindustry is increasingly focused on sustainable production, a better, more\nrelevant buying experience and upcycling as a new standard. At Veesual, we're\nmeeting those changes by drastically improving how shoppers buy online which\ncreates a more inclusive retail experience while also improving fit and\nreducing waste,\" said Veesual Co-Founder and CEO, Maxime Patte. \"This\nfundraise is critical for our plans as we scale in the United States with\nbrands who are pioneering the augmented shopping experience. We anticipate\nsignificant growth in 2024 and beyond.\"\n\nAbout Veesual Founded in 2020, Veesual was developed when co-founders Maxime\nPatte and Damien Meurisse recognized the limited means of fashion brands to\nvisually engage diverse customers online. The platform offers solutions that\nleverage the power of images to create inclusive experiences that engage all\ncustomers. Globally, brands including Claudie Pierlot, Sergeant Major and La\nRedoute use Veesual. To date, these partnerships have outperformed\nexpectations, with a 75% average increase in conversation rate and a more than\n20% increase in average order value for shoppers who engaged with one of\nVeesual's solutions.
