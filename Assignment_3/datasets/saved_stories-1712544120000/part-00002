A 45-rpm single could hold only\nabout five minutes of music. Exceeding this often meant a dip in sound\nquality.\n\nRadio edits typically shortened songs to around three and a half minutes to\naccommodate advertising and news segments. \u201cWriters who want to have pop hits\nfor mainstream radio are likely to be influenced by that technological\nconstraint,\u201d said Bennett.\n\nBut several artists in the 1960s experimented with longer compositions that\nstretched the limits of what was considered standard. Bob Dylan\u2019s \u201cLike a\nRolling Stone\u201d rumbled for more than six minutes, and by the time the Beatles\nfinished the last na-na-na, \u201cHey Jude\u201d had crossed the seven-minute mark.\n\n\u201cThey were the Beatles ... they had commercial power to get the radio stations\nto do what they wanted,\u201d said Bennett. Fans didn\u2019t mind the extra length \u2014\nthey bought the records and sang along with the heartfelt pleas \u2014 and soon\nother artists began to push through the vinyl ceiling.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, tapes and CDs didn\u2019t have the time limitations of\nvinyl and allowed artists more flexibility in songwriting. The average song\nlength peaked at 4 minutes 21 seconds in 1992.\n\nNow streaming platforms are shaping music trends. On platforms like Spotify,\nartists earn royalties only if a listener stays engaged for at least 30\nseconds, making songs with shorter intros and instantly engaging hooks\ndominant as it ensures that listeners don\u2019t skip on to the next.\n\nStreaming platforms\u2019 pay-per-play model also incentivizes artists to create\nshorter songs. Shorter songs encourage more replays, and more replays mean\nmore revenue.\n\n\u201cA lot of songs don\u2019t have bridges anymore, which is really disappointing for\nme because a bridge in a song is so special. It\u2019s one of my favorite parts of\nwriting. Streaming music has definitely affected that,\u201d said Erika Nuri\nTaylor, a songwriter who was nominated for a 2008 Grammy for the song \u201cWhen I\nSee U,\u201d recorded by Fantasia Barrino. Shorter intros, sing the chorus upfront,\ndon\u2019t have long, boring bits when not much happens \u2014 these are now the keys\nfor success.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven social media is nudging song lengths downward. Video platforms encourage\nusers to join dance challenges and create meme videos with short song\nsnippets. Few people want to make \u2014 let alone watch \u2014 an eight-minute TikTok.\n\n\u201cThe attention span for any entertainment has changed a lot. People are\ninterested for two minutes and then they want to switch to the next thing \u2014\nthe next song, the next video, the next TikTok. It\u2019s constant scrolling and\nbouncing around,\u201d said Nuri Taylor.\n\nTake Lil Yachty\u2019s \u201cPoland.\u201d The 83-second hit captivated audiences with its\nbrevity, catchy hook and meme-friendly content.
