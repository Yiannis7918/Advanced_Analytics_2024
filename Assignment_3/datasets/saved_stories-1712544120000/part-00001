Amid the\ncommotion, an invisible gas often escapes unnoticed, warming the planet and\nharming our health: methane.\n\nOn Thursday, the climate-data sleuths at Carbon Mapper published a study in\nScience that shows U.S. landfills emit methane at levels at least 40 percent\nhigher than previously reported to the Environmental Protection Agency. At\nmore than half of the hundreds of garbage dumps surveyed \u2014 in the largest\nassessment yet of such emissions \u2014 most of the pollution flowed from leaks,\ncreating concentrated plumes. The researchers found these super-emitting\npoints can persist for months or even years, and account for almost 90 percent\nof all measured methane from the landfills. Tackling these hotspots could be a\nhuge stride toward lowering emission rates, but blindspots in current\nmonitoring protocols mean they often evade detection.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very hard problem to get totally right without any leaks at any\nplace,\u201d said Daniel Cusworth, an atmospheric chemist and project scientist for\nCarbon Mapper, a nonprofit that provides data to inform greenhouse gas\nreduction efforts. Sometimes Cusworth conducts aerial surveys of landfills and\nis relieved to find nothing. \u201cAnd then other times, you know, I\u2019ll see a\nmassive billowing plume that\u2019s three kilometers long.\u201d\n\nMethane is a potent greenhouse gas created by, among other things, decaying\ntrash, and it often seeps through the soil and plastic covers meant to contain\nit. Although federal regulations require large facilities to use gas capture\nsystems, landfills remain the third biggest source of these emissions in the\nUnited States, accounting for over 14 percent of the national total. Because\nmethane is 84 times more powerful than carbon dioxide during its first 20\nyears in the atmosphere, scientists say reducing the amount of it floating\naround up there is the quickest way to curb global warming. Doing so also\nbenefits communities: A disproportionate number of U.S. landfills are near\nmarginalized neighborhoods, where gas exposure impacts health or poses an\nexplosion risk.\n\nGrist thanks its sponsors.

Here's How\n\nLeaks that exceed the Clean Air Act\u2019s limit of 500 parts per million are\ncommon, as shown by the hotspots Carbon Mapper identified. These areas\ntypically appear after unanticipated events, such as cracks in landfill\ncovers, valve failure in the vast gas collection systems, and other\nmaintenance or construction issues. \u201cThey really dominated the total emissions\nfor the landfill,\u201d Cusworth said. The survey found that average release from\nthe most surveyed sites was at least 1.4 times, and sometimes as much as 2.7\ntimes, larger than those reported to the EPA\u2019s Greenhouse Gas Reporting\nProgram.\n\nMethane plumes observed by Carbon Mapper during aerial surveys at a landfill\nin Georgia Carbon Mapper\n\nAlthough federal guidelines require these facilities to track emissions and\nprovide that data to the EPA, current reporting and monitoring methods just\naren\u2019t up to snuff, according to the study. Most operators report an estimate,\nusing EPA guidelines, calculated from the amount of trash they take in, not\nfrom measured data. Regulators also require facilities to perform walking\nground surveys four times a year, but experts like Cusworth say these efforts\naren\u2019t frequent or precise enough. Hotspots can easily escape notice because\nmany areas are too dangerous or inaccessible to walk on, and monitoring\nsensors react only to high concentrations on the ground and wouldn\u2019t catch\ndispersed plumes. \u201cYou can\u2019t manage what you can\u2019t measure,\u201d said Cusworth,\nadding that it\u2019s a popular cliche in the air monitoring business.\n\nIn the survey, the Carbon Mapper researchers flew over landfills with\nairplanes that captured infrared images, revealing the plumes. Similar remote\nsensing methods, such as drones and satellites, are among recent technological\nadvances that could keep the pollutant in check, helping facilities find and\naddress leaks quickly. Other innovations to methane capturing systems, such as\nself-calibrating caps on valves and sensors that can detect leaks, further\nreduce the risk of failures.\n\n\u201cIn the waste sector, specifically, we know what technologies to implement \u2013\nwe\u2019ve known for a number of years. They\u2019re feasible, readily available, and a\nnumber of them are actually quite cost effective,\u201d said Kait Siegel, waste\nsector manager on the methane pollution team at Clean Air Task Force. \u201cWe need\nto have regulations in place.\u201d This upcoming August, the EPA is expected to\nupdate its landfill management policies as part of a required 8-year review\ncycle.\n\nGrist thanks its sponsors.

Here's How\n\nTom Frankiewicz, a waste sector methane scientist at RMI, which collaborated\nwith Carbon Mapper on the study, said addressing outsized methane sources,\nlike landfills, is urgent due to the short lifespan and extreme potency of the\ngas, compared to the longer-lasting carbon dioxide. The world won\u2019t see the\nclimate benefits of reducing CO2 emissions for a century, he said. That time\nframe drops to a decade when curbing methane. \u201cWe have to be working on both,\nand leaning in on methane because it buys us time.\u201d And in the race to\nmitigate climate change, every moment counts.\n\nRead Next\n\nA message from\n\n#### All donations DOUBLED!\n\nGrist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable\nsolutions to climate change.
