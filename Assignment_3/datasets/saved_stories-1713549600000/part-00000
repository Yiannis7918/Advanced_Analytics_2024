Hoffman\n\nmaravic/Getty Images\n\nIn early April, a committee of U.S. aviation, aeromedical and safety experts\npublished a landmark report commissioned by the Federal Aviation\nAdministration (FAA) related to the mental health of pilots and air traffic\ncontrollers. The 24 recommendations directed to the FAA include sweeping\nchanges to current mental health policies, including dropping the need for\npilots and controllers to inform the FAA when they see a therapist and easing\nthe pathway to medication use for aviation workers. These recommendations and\nothers could transform an industry whose medical fitness standards may have\ncreated barriers for certain pilots and controllers needing mental health\nassistance. Now, FAA and industry leaders must decide if and how to enact\nthese recommendations.\n\nThe FAA requires airline pilots and air traffic controllers to meet certain\nmedical standards in order to work. Pilots and controllers who disclose that\nthey have new mental health symptoms, or that they are taking a new\npsychoactive medication or seeing a therapist may run the risk of what is\nusually a temporary loss of their medical certification. Time out of work can\nresult in lost pay, and the evaluations required to return can be prolonged,\nunpredictable and expensive. For this reason, I and others have argued that\npilots and controllers face a barrier to seeking mental health care due to\nwhat a change in health status might mean for their career.\n\nData from my colleagues and myself support this; a study of 5,170 pilots\nacross the U.S. and Canada showed that 56 percent reported a history of health\ncare avoidance (for example, reporting that they decided to forgo an\nevaluation for a symptom or not fully disclosing health information during\nscreening) based on their fear that they would lose their flying status. While\nthese data included all types of health concerns, it seems reasonable to also\napply these data to mental health. The U.S. has employed its current approach\nto screening pilots and controllers for many years in hopes of ensuring they\nare fit to perform their high-risk and often stressful duties. That said, many\nvoices are now calling to change a system that may inadvertently harm aviation\nworkers while not always achieving what it aims to do.\n\n\u201cNo one ... should have to think twice about their job before seeking help,\u201d\nsaid National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy during a\nDecember roundtable on aviation mental health, as quoted in the Web\npublication The Hill. \u201cAnd yet, we\u2019re here today because that\u2019s not currently\nthe case in U.S. aviation.\u201d\n\nMultiple mental health incidents in pilots, including a recent one in which an\noff-duty airline pilot attempted to shut down the engines of a full passenger\naircraft amid a mental health crisis, and a bipartisan letter from Congress\nchallenging the FAA to modernize its mental health protocols, fueled momentum\nthat culminated in the committee\u2019s report. The committee is formally known as\nthe Mental Health and Aviation Medical Clearances Aviation Rulemaking\nCommittee; such bodies are referred to as ARCs.\n\n\u201cMy personal belief is that the goal of this Mental Health ARC is to better\nthe life of all pilots and controllers both current and aspiring,\u201d Travis\nLudwig, Air Line Pilots Association representative and committee co-chair\nwrote in the report. \u201cThis ARC strived to save a life, a job, a family. If we\naccomplish this lofty goal even once, the amount of work thrown into this\nproject will be worth it.\u201d\n\nNow FAA leaders will need to determine not only which recommendations they\nincorporate, but also how to cover the costs, while assuring the 2.5 million\npassengers who fly in the U.S. daily that changes are safe. In an agency\nresponsible for overseeing one of the world\u2019s safest aviation systems, some\nrecommendations are likely to face obstacles. While new mental health\neducation efforts are unlikely to face opposition, broad overhauls to computer\nand medical processing systems will likely be contingent on major support\noutside of the agency. More difficult will be decisions about what pilots and\ncontrollers can do while working and what they need to tell the FAA amid a\nsurprising paucity of safety data. To implement the committee\u2019s 24\nrecommendations, the FAA will need broad support both within and outside of\nthe agency.\n\nMental health is not the only aspect of aviation facing calls for change.\nIncidents involving Boeing aircraft\u2014including the death of 346 passengers in\ntwo Boeing 737 MAX 8 incidents attributed to corporate missteps in the rollout\nof new flight control systems and a Boeing 737 MAX 9 door plug falling off in-\nflight\u2014have brought public calls for the FAA to have stricter oversight over\nwhat critics view as a decades-long slide towards lax self-regulation and\nconcessions to quickly building aircraft. \u201cIt is time to reexamine the\ndelegation of authority and assess associated safety risks,\u201d FAA Administrator\nMike Whitaker said in a January 2024 statement, adding that \u201cmultiple\nproduction-related issues identified in recent years require us to look at\nevery option to reduce risk.\u201d When it comes to building America\u2019s aircraft,\ncalls to increase oversight aim to bolster safety.\n\nBut despite this discourse, one critical misunderstanding must be avoided when\nit comes to mental health.\n\nGovernment leaders and ultimately the flying public must avoid the simplistic\nview that the committee\u2019s recommendations aim to reduce oversight at the cost\nof safety. This is simply not the case. History has taught us that turning up\nthe dials on traditional oversight tools does not necessarily mean greater\nsafety when it comes to mental health. Instead, these recommendations propose\nnovel, innovative ways to address hidden risks currently existing within our\nnational air space while acknowledging an elemental quality of every aviation\nworker: the normal human need for support. This should be a key part of the\nFAA\u2019s messaging to the public. Further, the public should insist the FAA is\nprovided sufficient funding and backing to implement all 24 recommendations\nthat will ultimately bolster wellness and safety in our aviation system.\n\nThis is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed are those of\nthe author or authors and not necessarily those of any other organization or\nScientific American.\n\nRights & Permissions\n\nWilliam R.
