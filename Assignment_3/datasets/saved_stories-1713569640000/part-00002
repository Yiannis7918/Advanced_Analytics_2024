Stripe (5 / 8 use it)\n\nAverage score: 80 / 100\n\nCosts go up into the thousands per month based on how much revenue they are\ndoing.\n\nTop Review: \"It handles all the payment methods we offer. We also built an\nentire subscription system for our customers using Stripe Connect. Our\ncustomers can offer subscriptions to their customers using Calendesk and\nStripe. I like their API; it's easy to integrate and super reliable.\nAdditionally, the variety of features Stripe offers allows companies like\nCalendesk to provide more options for their customers. However, I'm not a fan\nof their invoicing system. We couldn't use it in Poland because it lacked some\nimportant information required for Polish customers. The fees are quite high\nas well.\"\n\n### 2\\. Webflow (3/8 use it)\n\nAverage score: 85 / 100\n\nAverage cost: $61 / month\n\nTop Review: \"We'll be using it soon for the new product page, blog, and help\ncenter. We're moving away from custom code. It solves the problem of designing\nUIs and then having to code them. Now, just one person can manage the website\ndesign and simultaneously bring the design to life on a real webpage. It also\nseems to be well-optimized for SEO purposes. However, I dislike their pricing;\nthere are lots of hidden costs that you're unaware of when you start.\nSometimes, the designer itself is buggy, especially in the localization\nmodules.\"\n\n### Other Tools Mentioned Where 2/8 use them:\n\n### Sendgrid, Slack, Google Workspace, Trello, ChatGPT, AWS, Plausible\n\n### More datapoints:\n\nThe median number of software products used by a SaaS founder is 8 products.\n\nThe founder of the 8 figure company with 100+ employees uses 27 products.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, this survey of eight SaaS founders reveals insightful trends\nand preferences in their use of various software tools, highlighting Stripe\nand Webflow as particularly prominent among them. Stripe emerges as a favored\npayment platform, appreciated for its robust API and extensive feature set,\nthough it faces criticism for its invoicing capabilities and higher fees,\nespecially from international users. Webflow, on the other hand, is noted for\nits ability to streamline web design and development, though its pricing\nstructure and occasional bugs in the designer tool present challenges. The\ndata also illustrates a wide variance in the number of tools used, with the\nmedian standing at eight but reaching as high as 27 for larger companies. This\ndiversity in software adoption underscores the varying needs and scaling\nchallenges faced by SaaS companies at different stages of growth. As the\ndigital landscape evolves, the adaptability and integration capabilities of\nthese tools will likely play a crucial role in their sustained popularity and\neffectiveness within the SaaS community.\n\n## Discover the stacks behind successful entrpreneurs\n\nFounder Stacks\n\nContactPrivacy PolicyBLOG\n\n", "frontpage": false}
