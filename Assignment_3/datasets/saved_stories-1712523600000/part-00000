So I want your assurance that AI isn\u2019t removing\nthe human from the loop.\u201d\n\nStewart cited an NBC News interview with Microsoft\u2019s CEO, Satya Nadella, who\nargued: \u201cThis is not about removing the human from the loop. In fact, it\u2019s\nabout empowering the human\u201d with an \u201cassistant\u201d.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s good for all of us!\u201d said Stewart. \u201cAlthough they do let the real\ntruth slip out every now and again.\u201d As Arvind Krishna, the CEO of IBM put it:\n\u201cWe can get the same work done with fewer people. That\u2019s just the nature of\nproductivity.\u201d\n\nStewart shook his head with recognition. \u201cSo AI can cure diseases and solve\nclimate change, but that\u2019s not exactly what companies are going to be using it\nfor, are they?\u201d\n\nSeth Meyers on Trump selling Bibles: \u2018His slimiest cash grab yet\u2019\n\nRead more\n\nStewart noted the example of Dukaan, a company that used AI as a reason to lay\noff 90% of its employees. As the company\u2019s CEO, Suumit Shah, put it on Fox\nNews: \u201cIt\u2019s brutal, if you think like a, uh, like a human.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018AI: it\u2019s brutal, if you think like, as a human\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s not the catchiest ad\nslogan I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d Stewart remarked.\n\n\u201cSo while we wait for this thing to cure diseases and solve climate change,\nit\u2019s replacing us in the workforce \u2013 not in the future, but now,\u201d he added.\n\nStewart then looked back on how presidents from George HW Bush onwards\nrationalized the loss of jobs for progress \u2013 essentially, by arguing that\npeople should train for new ones and embrace change.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the game,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s globalization or industrialization\nor now artificial intelligence, the way of life that you are accustomed to is\nno match to the promise of more profit and new markets. Which sounds brutal,\nif you\u2019re a human.\n\n\u201cBut at least those other disruptions took place over a century, or decades,\u201d\nhe continued. \u201cAI is going to be ready to take over by Thursday. And once that\nhappens, what the fuck is there left for the rest of us to do?\u201d\n\n## Seth Meyers\n\nOn Late Night, Seth Meyers reacted to Donald Trump\u2019s 70-plus posts on Truth\nSocial on Easter. \u201cWhat was in the baskets at the Trump family Easter egg\nhunt? Cadbury meth eggs?\u201d he wondered.\n\nThe Easter rant, which Meyers read in full, \u201cmay be the most deranged thing\nthat Trump has ever posted online, which is saying something because he once\nmisspelled is own name.\n\n\u201cBut Trump\u2019s lunacy is not an aberration within the GOP; it\u2019s the norm,\u201d he\nadded. \u201cThey spent all weekend furious about the fact that transgender day of\nvisibility just happened to fall on the same day as Easter this year, and they\nblamed it on Joe Biden rather than the real reason, the calendar.\u201d\n\nAs one Fox News commentator put it: \u201cThis is a clear and coordinated effort to\nremove God from our society and to replace God with false gods, in this\ninstance, it\u2019s the trans community.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, we should have a more respectful Easter proclamation that puts the\nemphasis where it\u2019s deserved \u2013 evil Fani Willis, sick Jack Smith and the\ncorrupt judges and prosecutors who despise America,\u201d Meyers deadpanned. \u201cNot\nonly did Trump not mention religion in his screed, everyone who read it took\nthe Lord\u2019s name in vain.\u201d\n\n## Stephen Colbert\n\nOn the Late Show, Stephen Colbert recapped Trump\u2019s all-caps screed on Truth\nSocial that said, in part: \u201cHappy Easter to all, including crooked and corrupt\nprosecutors and judges that are doing everything possible to interfere with\nthe presidential election of 2024, and put me in prison, including those many\npeople that I completely & totally despise.\u201d\n\n\u201c... and also with you,\u201d Colbert deadpanned.\n\nIn happier Easter news, the White House Easter egg roll enlisted 40,000\nparticipants this year. \u201cBut, as with everything in our politics, the Maga\ncrowd found something to be fake outraged about,\u201d Colbert noted. In this case,\nFox News complained that the White House banned religious-themed designs from\nthe Easter egg art contest, despite the fact that such guidelines have been in\nplace since 1976. \u201cHow dare they dishonor the true spirit of Easter, when\nJesus laid colorful eggs for his apostles to find!\u201d Colbert joked.\n\nAnd according to new SEC filings, Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter knock-off Truth\nSocial lost $58m in 2023. \u201cHow could that be?\u201d Colbert wondered. \u201cThey have\nsuch a solid business model \u2013 old rapist yells at Easter!\u201d\n\n## Jimmy Kimmel\n\nAnd in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel admitted that he missed the Trump\nadministration\u2019s Easter egg rolls: \u201cMelania reading books to the kids, Donald\npretending he\u2019s ever been to church, Secret Service trying to get Eric to stop\nbeating the plastic eggs. Those were the days.\u201d\n\nAs part of his social media rampage over the weekend, Trump posted an article\nfrom a far-right outlet titled \u201cThe Crucifixion of Donald Trump\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, you know, Jesus was treated unfairly, too. Some would say, the\nsecond most unfairly in history,\u201d Kimmel laughed. \u201cOnly Donald Trump would\nrepost a photo of himself holding a Bible upside down.\u201d\n\nAs for Eric\u2019s wife Lara Trump\u2019s new music, released on Easter weekend, all\nKimmel had to say was: \u201cAutotune doesn\u2019t work on everyone.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s threatening to release one new song every week until she achieves her\ngoal of marrying her father-in-law,\u201d Kimmel added. \u201cAnd that is not an April\nFool\u2019s joke.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Late-night TV roundup\n  * Stephen Colbert\n  * Jon Stewart\n  * Seth Meyers\n  * Jimmy Kimmel\n  * TV comedy\n  * Comedy\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Books\n  * Music\n  * TV & radio\n  * Art & design\n  * Film\n  * Games\n  * Classical\n  * Stage\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
