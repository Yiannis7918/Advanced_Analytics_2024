The displayed span is 2-22 MHz. Click on the image for a larger version  \n---  \n  \nAbout the TinySA:\n\nThe \"TinySA\" is a small spectrum analyzer with a 2.4\" touch screen, costing\napproximately U.S. $50. Capable of operating from below 100 kHz to as high as\n950 MHz (the optimal range being between 100 kHz and 350 MHz) its minimum\nresolution bandwidth (RBW) is about 2.6 kHz. This resolution bandwidth is too\nwide for precise analysis of the components of an SSB or NBFM signal, but it\nis useful for general RF surveying - including the measurement of harmonic and\noff-frequency spurious components of a transmitter in addition to the\ndetection of low-level signal sources.\n\nWhile it may seem silly to use a spectrum analyzer for the detection of\nsignals, the TinySA, at about U.S. $50, is only about 2-3 times the cost of\nthe least expensive, battery-powered shortwave receiver that you'll find\nonline - and it has the advantage of \"seeing\" a large swath of spectrum in a\nsingle view, allowing detection of signal sources that may otherwise go\nunnoticed.\n\nThe usable sensitivity of the TinySA in the range of 1 MHz to 350 MHz (e.g.\nthe \"Low\" input) is approximately -152dB/Hz meaning that its sensitivity is\nslightly poorer - but roughly comparable to - \"real\" spectrum analyzers with\nexpensive-sounding names: This value is quite a bit poorer than a typical\ncommunications-grade receiver which will likely have a sensitivity better than\n-160dB/Hz - often much better.\n\nThe TinySA comes with a telescoping antenna, but being only about 12\" (25cm)\nlong it's usefulness extend below VHF frequencies (e.g. 50-100 MHz): At HF,\nthe combination of the 50 ohm input impedance of the analyzer and the\nphenomenally poor mismatch of the small telescoping whip results in uselessly-\npoor sensitivity, meaning that one must be nearly atop a signal source before\nit may even be seen on the analyzer. Clearly, more help is needed here!\n\nThe TinySA is NOT the NanoVNA!The TinySA is NOT electrically similar to a\nNanoVNA, despite physical similarities: It has completely different circuitry\nand works like a \"real\" spectrum analyzer in that it's a proper, swept\nfrequency, narrowband logarithmic receiver-detector.While a NanoVNA does have\na detector that tracks its built-in signal generator, it makes a terrible\nspectrum analyzer!  \n---  \n  \nWhere to get a TinySA?\n\nThe TinySA is widely available - but there are apparently many inferior clones\nout there (e.g. lack of shielding, poorer quality or omitted components, etc.)\n\nFor the U.S. readers, I suggest R&L Electronics as a source (see the link\nHERE). I have no connection to R&L and suggest them only because they are\nsupplying the genuine article and they are an established equipment dealer\n(e.g. more likely to help if you have any problems with the unit), and they\nare offering it for a decent price.\n\n* * * * *\n\nActive antennas to the rescue:\n\nAdhering to the theme of portability, a useful companion to the TinySA would\nbe some sort of small, active antenna - and two of the most common types are\nthe active (E-field) whip and the electrically-small loop.\n\nThe Active Whip:\n\nA popular active whip is of the \"PA0RDT\" design - the so-called \"Mini-Whip\".\nIt is the intent that this antenna be mounted outside and in the clear with a\nquiet \"local\" ground - that is, well away from noise sources, grounded to a\nmass of metal (or a ground system) that is isolated from the (noisy!) shack\nground with a common-mode choke or two - so using it as a \"sense\" antenna for\nsniffing RF sources isn't exactly what the designer had in mind.\n\nFigure 2: A homebrew E-field whip using the PA0RDT design. This unit is built\ninto a piece of 1/2\" PVC irrigation pipe. A BNC connector was chosen over an\nSMA for durability. Click on the image for a larger version  \n---  \n  \nThe reason for this specification of a \"clean\" ground and being placed\noutside, in the clear is that this antenna - being a tiny fraction of a\nwavelength on the highest frequency for which it is to be used - is\nessentially a capacitor that couples into the \"\u00e6ther\" (e.g. free space). To\naccomplish this, the whip is just a Hi-Z probe that has no gain of its own,\nbut rather a circuit that matches the impedance of the \"antenna\" portion\n(usually a piece of wire or a plate of copper on a circuit board) to 50 ohms\ntypically using JFET and bipolar follower circuits, avoiding what would\notherwise be tremendous losses due to mismatch - but this is only half of the\nantenna: The feedline - and the gear to which it is connected - is the other\nhalf - and this is the basis of the recommendation of a \"local\" ground with\nthe feedline being decoupled via a common mode choke to minimize the\nconduction of RF energy from a \"noisy\" shack ground.\n\nAs a \"sense\" antenna in this application, its purpose is largely to determine\nthe presence of RF energy: Sources of this energy may be located by noting the\namplitude increase as one moves the antenna nearer to the potentially-noisy\ndevice - or near a conductor (e.g. power cord, cable, etc.) that is conducting\nor radiating this RF energy. Because the antenna will be carried by the user,\nthe \"ground\" portion of the antenna will be nothing more than the hand\ncapacitance of the user holding the equipment and the connecting cables - and\nit is imperative that these not be a source of interference in their own right\nor connected to something that could be a source of such signals.\n\nFigure 3: Inside the E-field whip of Figure 2. The \"antenna\" is the copper\nfoil \"plate\" with the electronics having been built on an SMD prototype board.\nThis version uses the BF862 JFET as the source-follower and a BFU589GX as the\nemitter-follower. Click on the image for a larger version.  \n---  \n  \nBecause of the vagaries of coupling energy into this \"whip\" - which include\nthe inconsistencies mentioned above - it's difficult to make absolute signal\nlevel measurements, but relative amplitude measurements can be made by noting\nsignal levels as it's moved about. Because it lacks directionality and is\nrelatively insensitive to polarization, proximity is indicated mostly by\nrelative amplitude: If one happens to be close to the suspected device or\ninterference source, this is easy to discern as even small changes of distance\nto the source can markedly change amplitude, but if you are somewhat distant\nfrom it this will not be the case and the lack of a directional response can\nbe a challenge as one may not know in which direction one should move to get\ncloser.\n\nA few more articles about the small whip - its construction and its operation:\n\ndl1dbc.net/SAQ/Mwhip/Article_pa0rdt-Mini-Whip_English.pdf - The diagram of\nthis ubiquitous circuit is that in Figure 7.\n\n472khz.org/media/pa0rdt-Mini-Whip-Manual.pdf\n\npa3fwm.nl/technotes/tn07.html\n\nAnd an \"improved\" version:\n\npa3fwm.nl/projects/miniwhip/\n\nWhere to get a mini-whip?\n\nIf you choose not to build one, the so-called \"Mini-Whip\" and its clones may\nbe found on EvilBay and Amazon - to mention but two places - typically for $25\nU.S. or less. All of these devices work reasonably well - the ones from\nEastern Europe often performing slightly better and being more consistent in\nquality than those from Asia - and they come with a \"power inserter\" (a.k.a.\n\"Bias Tee\") - a device that injects DC power for the amplified antenna onto\nits coaxial cable.\n\nThese antennas are also easy to construct, the details being found - and the\ntheory of operation - in the above links.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe Small Loop:\n\nThis name refers to an \"electrically small\" loop - that is, one with a\ncircumference that is a small fraction of the wavelength of the highest\nfrequency for which it to be used. For LF, MF and HF purposes, we are\nreferring to a receive-only loop that is typically 1-3 feet (25-75cm) in\ndiameter.\n\nFigure 4: The completed shielded loop. The gap in the shield is on the top\nwith the transformer and amplifier in the box at the bottom. The loop itself\nis 3/8\" \"Heliax\" supported by a frame made of 3/4\" PVC irrigation pipe, using\na \"cross\" in the center and \"tees\" on the sides. Click on the image for a\nlarger version  \n---  \n  \nUnlike the active whip, this antenna can be entirely \"self contained\" in the\nsense that the amount of energy impinging on the loop that is being conveyed\nto the receiving device and the cable itself has little effect on this level.\nAdditionally, this type of antenna exhibits a degree of directionality with\nsharp, deep nulls being present normal to the plane of the loop - which is\nanother way of saying that if you were to hold the loop flat against your\nchest, the nulls would be directly in front of and behind you with very broad\npeaks to your left and right.\n\nThis loop, being electrically small for the intended wavelengths, has negative\ngain compared to a full-sized antenna, but even a chunk of coaxial cable\nconnected directly to the loop with no attempt at matching will work \"less\nbadly\" than a piece of wire or telescoping antenna - with no amplification or\nmatching - of similar size. Having said this, including a modest amount of\ngain in the loop's signal path is extremely helpful.\n\nHaving consistent \"gain\" lobes and nulls means that the amplitude readings\nfrom this type of antenna are more predictable and it is possible to divine\nthe apparent bearing of the noise source by exclusion. Because this type of\nantenna has two nulls (and two broad peaks) one must move about to resolve\nthis ambiguity, noting the geometry of the direction of the these null and\nyour surroundings to determine if it is very close or distant - and whether it\nis in front of or behind you!\n\nWhere do I get a loop like this?\n\nUnfortunately, these loop antennas are nowhere near as ubiquitous as the \"Mini\nWhip\" - and those that are available tend to cost about an order of magnitude\nmore than a mini-whip. Fortunately, these types of antennas are not\nparticularly difficult to construct - and such a loop is described below.\n\nWhile this type of antenna may be constructed using just loop of wire - and\nthe techniques shown in Figure 7, below, will work fine with just a piece of\nwire, the preferred version is the \"shielded loop\" as it is somewhat less\nsensitive to very nearby E-field interference and its pattern of broad peaks\nand nulls can be more symmetrical and of better quality - as discussed here:\n\nw8ji.com/magnetic_receiving_loops.htm\n\nand\n\nowenduffy.net/antenna/shieldedloop/index.htm\n\n* * * * *\n\nWhich type of antenna should I use?\n\nIf I had to choose just ONE of these types of antennas, I would pick the loop\nantenna due to its directional properties using the nulls.\n\nHaving said that, I would prefer to have both on hand: The whip is much\nsmaller and can easily be held near suspect devices and conductors to aid in\ndetection/exclusion.\n\n* * * * *\n\nConstructing a shielded, symmetrical, untuned loop:\n\nThis portion of the article will described the \"untuned, balanced, shielded\"\nloop, and adding a simple amplifier to extend the noise floor of the TinySA.\nThere are many ways to construct this type of loop, but what follows is a\nrather simple and effective version that will tolerate component variations\nquite well.\n\nIn addition to locating sources of noise and interference, it provides\nreasonable performance for general listening on frequencies from below the AM\nbroadcast band to the top of HF, and its ability to cast a null toward a noise\nsource may prove to be useful. While lacking the apparent \"gain\" response of\nthe resonance peak of a tuned loop at a specific frequency, an untuned loop is\neasier to build and more convenient to use in a broadband application.\n\nWhat to use for the loop itself?\n\nIt common to use \"Heliax\" (tm) coaxial cable (50 or 75 ohm is fine) to\nconstruct the loop itself - typically of the 1/2 inch or 3/8 inch variety as\nit is fairly rigid and can support itself fairly well, mechanically. Aluminum-\njacketed CATV (cable TV) \"hardline\" will work as well - although unlike the\nHeliax - which has a copper jacket - making connection to the outside shield\ncan be a challenge.\n\n\"I don't have any hardline/Heliax - can I use 'normal' coax?\"\n\nBarring the availability of \"scraps\" of Heliax cable, ordinary coaxial cable\nwill also work quite well, but it must be mechanically supported as it may not\nbe able to hold any shape - The frame depicted in Figure 4, above, can do\nthis. If you are using \"ordinary\" coaxial cable, practically any coax will\nwork, from RG-58 to RG-11 (the impedance doesn't really matter): Even\ninexpensive RG-6 cable will work if one uses standard \"F\" connectors - both on\nthe cable itself and on the box containing the electronics - to make reliable\nconnections to the aluminum shield found on most cables of this type.\n\nFigure 5: Details of the gap in the middle of the shield - the dielectric foam\nbeing retained for additional support. This gap should be covered with heat-\nshrinkable tubing or electrical tape to protect it from moisture. Sliding a\npiece of rigid tubing over the gap is recommended to immobilize the cable at\nthe gap in the shield. A small piece of metal tubing may be used for this as\nlong as it's insulated from the shields. Click on the image for a larger\nversion.  \n---  \n  \nFor the loop described, I used a 66\" (167cm) long scrap of 3/8\" Heliax (FSJ2\ntype) which would correlate with a loop diameter of approximately 21\" (53cm) -\nbut the precise length and diameter is unimportant in this case: While a\nlarger loop (with a greater area inside the loop) will intercept more signal,\na loop that is between 12\" and 24\" (25-50cm) diameter will work.\n\nIn the center of the loop, as depicted in Figure 5, there must be a small gap\nwhere the shield is opened, symmetrical about the loop's circumference: Were a\ngap not present, this would simply be a loop of coax and a signal could not be\nexcited on its center conductor with respect to the shield portion. This type\nof loop has the advantage that an electrostatic field cannot easily excite the\ninner conductor, but the lack of the \"shorted turn\" provided by the gap in the\nshield means that the magnetic field portion of the signal is unimpeded.\n(Hint: Determine the center of the length of coaxial cable that you plan to\nuse for your loop before you form it into a loop!)\n\nFeeding the loop:\n\nFigure 6: Inside the box - the transformer and loop amplifier. The transformer\n(T101 in Figure 7, below) may be seen in the middle. The circuitry is built\n\"dead bug\" on a piece of glass- epoxy circuit board material bolted to the\nbottom of the box. The shields of the halves of the loop are connected with\nheavy wire to the circuit board - both for electrical bonding and mechanical\nsupport - and wire (a.k.a. \"zip\") ties are used to prevent the cable from\nbeing pulled out through the sides of the box. The RF out/DC in is via a BNC\nconnector mounted to the side of the box - this being preferable to the bottom\nof the box to help protect it from damage in handling. Click on the image for\na larger version.  \n---  \n  \nThe two open ends of the loop are brought together opposite the shield gap and\nit is there that the shields are connected to each other at a common signal\n\"ground\" - and this is typically done in a small enclosure: While a metal box\nis preferred, it's not absolutely necessary. The box shown in Figure 6 is a\ndie-cast aluminum enclosure approximately 5-3/4\" x 2-1/2\" and 1-1/2\" deep\n(about 122 x 65 x 40mm).\n\nWhile one may simply connect a 50 ohm coax to either side of the center\nconductor of the loop - and connecting the shield of that cable to the shield\nof the loop itself - this will cause a bit of asymmetry. Practically speaking,\nthis isn't going to cause much of an issue in terms of directionality, but it\nis preferred that balance be maintained to provide the best symmetry in its\nresponse. While there are many designs out there that include differential\namplifiers, the use of a simple, ferrite transformer will be just fine for\nthis - and most - applications. Remember: We are looking for noise sources!\n\nFor this, a small transformer must be constructed. A good choice for this is a\ntoroid - either an FT37-75 or FT50-75. Experimentally I determined that either\n2 or 3 turns on the primary and 3 or 4 turns on the secondary will provide\ngood response across the HF spectrum (I used 3 turns on each, for a 1:1 turns\nratio). The gauge of wire is not critical and something in the range of 18-26\nis suggested with a preference on the larger size.\n\nAmplification:\n\nBecause of its small size, the gain of the loop will be very low compared to a\nfull-sized antenna and to bring the signal level up to where weaker signals\nmay be \"seen\" by the TinySA, a simple amplifier is used, depicted\nschematically in Figure 7, below. This amplifier could be considered to be a\ngeneral-purpose \"gain block\" as it is quite well-behaved in terms of stability\nand input and output impedance - and it is very forgiving in terms of\ncomponent variation.\n\nCircuit description:\n\nFigure 7: Schematic of the loop/amplifier and power inserter (a.k.a. \"Bias\nTee\"). Click on the image for a larger version  \n---  \n  \nThe shielded loop is schematically depicted in Figure 7, above, along with the\ntransformer T101, which I found to work reasonably well with a 1:1 turns\nratio. Using a VNA and with a bit of empirical testing, this configuration was\noptimized for low-mid HF (e.g. 3-15 MHz or so) but it seemed to work quite\nwell through the AM broadcast band and below. Like many similar loops - and\nthe Mini-Whip - its performance will start to drop off at higher frequencies\n(above 20 MHz) and a bit of circuit redesign would be required to optimize for\nthese higher frequencies. As noted, the circumference of the loop must be a\nsmall fraction of the wavelength at the highest frequency at which it will be\nused in order to maintain the directionality of the nulls, so a loop of\napproximately 18\" diameter will work well throughout HF, but not offer the\ndesired properties on, say, 2 meters where its circumference would be\napproximately a quarter wave!\n\nT101 does a reasonable job of maintaining the symmetry of the loop itself -\nalthough purists would insist on a somewhat different topology to eke out\nevery bit. As described, the symmetry is quite good and it is possible to\ncompletely null local 50 kW AM broadcasts stations.\n\nAmplifier portion:\n\nQ101 and associated components form a simple feedback-type RF amplifier. This\nbasic circuit is well-behaved and has reasonable input and output matching to\n50 ohms. Shown is the use of the common 2N3904 transistor which is perfectly\nacceptable for this sort of use - and similar devices, such as the 2N2222 and\n2N4401 - work pretty well. A \"better\" device would be the 2N5109, 2N3866 or\nsimilar RF amplifier which will offer a bit better performance in terms of\nintermodulation distortion and gain at higher frequencies, but they are more\nexpensive and harder to find - and are likely overkill for a \"sniffing\"\ndevice. This amplifier is not the penultimate in performance (e.g. IP3, P1dB,\netc.) but it has very good performance and fairly low noise (6-8 dB noise\nfigure) considering its simplicity.\n\nTo a degree, the gain of this stage may be adjusted by varying the value of\nfeedback resistor R101 - resistances over the range of 330 to 680 ohms being\nuseful, with higher gain (roughly 18 dB) being associated with higher\nresistance. The purists will note changing devices or feedback resistance will\nalter the properties of the amplifier (e.g. input/output impedance, etc.) but\none can generally ignore this in all but the most critical applications - such\nas matching to an impedance-sensitive filter network.\n\nAlthough a battery could be placed within the loop's enclosure - in which case\nL101 could be eliminated and the V+ lead connected to the junction of\nC104/R104 - it is common to use a power inserter (a.k.a. \"Bias Tee\") that\ncouples DC onto same coaxial cable that conducts receive RF from the loop,\nmaking one bias tee useful for multiple antennas!\n\nHow much RF noise does the TinySA produce?Because it's a computer with a\ndisplay, one might wonder how much RF noise the TinySA itself produces.The\ndesigners of the TinySA appear to have been very careful about this - for\nexample, critical components are shielded and they to have chosen to use\nlinear voltage regulators instead of more-efficient switching-type regulators.\n(I can't speak to the construction of the many clones out there!)In testing,\nthe TinySA was held up to the E-field whip and placed inside (and moved\naround) inside the circumference of the loop: Through the range of 2-22 MHz,\nthere are no obvious \"spikes\" or lumps of noise that appear on the display -\nat least above the ambient RF noise floor in my ham shack.Clearly, one isn't\nlikely to walk around with the TinySA held against the antenna - but the\ninitial glance shows that you probably could get away with it!  \n---  \n  \nThe power for the amplifier is picked off the coaxial cable by decoupling\nchoke L101. The value of this choke is not critical - and anything above about\n100uH will work fine to a bit below the AM broadcast band.\n\nMolded chokes may work, but they tend to have quite high internal resistance\nand the current consumption of the amplifier itself (50-80 milliamps) can\ncause a significant voltage drop. An alternative is to use the same core as\nthat used for T101 (you did get several FT50-75 toroids, didn't you?)\n\nPower inserter (a.k.a. \"Bias Tee\")\n\nThe \"power inserter\" (a.k.a. \"Bias Tee\") is also included on the diagram and\nits job is to combine the RF and DC onto the same cable, using the same type\nof choke (L201) as on the amplifier portion. Optional enhancements to this\ndevice would be a diode (D201) to protect against accidental reverse-polarity\napplication to the antenna and an LED to show that power is turned on (LED201)\nwith its current intentionally set low (e.g. a 10k limiting resistor for about\n1mA) to minimize battery drain. The addition of a fuse - preferably of the\nself-resetting thermal type (F201, with a current rating of 100-300 mA) is a\ngood idea as well to prevent damage to the blocking choke, L201 should the\noutput be accidentally shorted and to limit current into protection diode D201\nshould reverse polarity be applied.\n\nIf you happen to get a \"Mini Whip\" from one of the online sources, it will\nlikely come with a power inserter/bias tee that is electrically very similar\nto that depicted above - and that device will work just fine with the\nloop/amplifier depicted in Figure 7.\n\n* * * * *\n\nUsing a shortwave receiver for RFI sensing and source identification:\n\nUp to now we haven't mentioned one RFI-locating tool that may be already in\nyour possession - a portable shortwave receiver.\n\nFigure 8: A small selection of inexpensive portable shortwave receivers.\nUpper-right: A DAK MR-101 - an inexpensive receiver from the early-mid 90s.\nLower-right: A Grundig YB-400PE - the only one shown that is capable of CW/\nSSB reception. On the left: A $15 receiver (labeled LCJ 310) - one of many\nnearly-identical units available from. Amazon capable of tuning from 5.9-21.85\nMHz on SW and on the AM and FM broadcast bands. Of the receivers pictured,\nonly the Grundig and DAK have external antenna connections (a 3.5mm \"phono\"\nconnector) which would be required to use the directionality of the loop\nantenna. This connector would be needed to be added to the \"LCJ\" receiver to\ntake advantage of this antenna property. Click on the image for a larger\nversion.  \n---  \n  \nWhile one can only \"hear\" a small bit of spectrum with a receiver rather than\n\"see\" a larger slice with an analyzer and increase the likelihood of detecting\nan otherwise-unnoticed interference source, being able to tune into an\ninterference source and listen to it can give a clue as to the source of this\nsignal and type of device. If your portable shortwave receiver has an external\nantenna jack - especially one that automatically disconnects the built-in\nantenna when a connection is made - you can use the same antennas (whip, loop)\ndescribed above and take advantage of any directional/nulling properties.\n\nFor example, a mains-frequency \"hum\" in the noise implies a switching power\nsupply while a sharp \"buzz\" might indicate a triac light dimmer. If your\nreceiver has a BFO, one may be able to hear the harmonics of a switching\nsupply and be able to specifically identify it by it's unique \"sound\" as it's\npowered on and off, being able to distinguish it from other devices.\n\nA caveat with the use of a receiver: Other than \"missing\" interference sources\non frequencies other than that to which the receiver is tuned, a receiver will\nhave an AGC which, by its nature, will adjust the internal gain to keep the\nvolume constant. When trying to locate a signal or noise source, this can work\nagainst you as it may be difficult to determine if the signal is moderately\nweak, strong, or very strong unless the AGC can be defeated and a manual RF\ngain control be operated - something that cannot usually be done with very\ninexpensive receivers. Even if this is the case, the \"sound\" of the\ninterference can still be useful in providing a clue as to the type of device\nthat may be causing the interference.\n\n* * * * *\n\nAgain, there are many possible ways to do this, but the gear described above\nhas been proven to be useful. The next installment of this two-part series\nwill include details on how it has been used and what to expect when doing so.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThis page stolen from ka7oei.blogspot.com\n\n[End]\n\nPosted by KA7OEI at\n\n9:52 PM\n\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest\n\nLabels: direction finding, interference, locating interference, loop, mini-\nwhip, PA0RDT, qrm, RFI, shielded loop, spectrum analyzer, tiny spectrum\nanalyzer, TinySA, untuned loop\n\n#### 5 comments:\n\n  1.

KA7OEIApril 25, 2021 at 9:38 AM\n\nHi Oliver,\n\nI'm surprised that you aren't seeing a bit of external noise floor with just\none stage of amplification on the loop - surely SWBC signals are reasonably\nstrong with the amplifier powered up?\n\nFor other uses, I have a version of this same loop/amp (although the loop is\nlarger) in which there is a DPDT relay that bypasses the amplifier when\nunpowered: I use this with my FT-817 which has a known problem in that S-meter\nreadings >= S9 along with its \"IPO\" and \"ATT\" settings to better-locate\nstrong, local signals.\n\nAnyway, the \"naked\" loop (no amplifier) - which significantly down from a\nfull-sized antenna - does permit hearing a reasonable number of signals on the\nlower bands (e.g. those that are open these days) so it would be good to make\nsure that the sensitivity of the loop passes a \"sanity check\": When connecting\na radio to the loop+amp, it should be roughly as good in absolute sensitivity\nas a full-sized antenna.\n\nTo answer your question: Yes, you *could* add another amplifier, but in my\nexperience, it shouldn't really be necessary.\n\nDelete\n\nReplies\n\nReply\n\nReply\n\nAdd comment\n\nLoad
