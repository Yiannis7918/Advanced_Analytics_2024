Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n# Ubisoft is stripping people's licences for The Crew weeks after its\nshutdown, nearly squandering hopes of fan servers and acting as a stark\nreminder of how volatile digital ownership is\n\nNews\n\nBy Mollie Taylor\n\npublished 17 hours ago\n\nUbisoft has gone one step further to try and stop people getting into The\nCrew.\n\n(Image credit: Ubisoft)\n\nThe downside of digital ownership has reared its ugly head for enjoyers of\nUbisoft's open-world multiplayer racer The Crew. The publisher has revoked its\nlicence for those who owned it on Ubisoft Connect, almost destroying fan\nambitions to revive the game in both an offline and online format.\n\nThe Crew was pulled from sale back in December, with Ubisoft revealing that\nthe servers would be shut down at the beginning of April. Frustratingly,\ndespite a large portion of the game being doable in singleplayer, The Crew\nremained an online-only endeavour throughout its decade-long lifespan. That\nhad already rendered the game unplayable, but it seems Ubisoft is determined\nto take things one step further to stamp out any attempts to continue playing\nit past its expiry date.\n\nFans began to notice earlier in the week that the licence to the game had been\nsnatched away from them. A message at the top of the game's library page\nreads, \"You no longer have access to this game. Why not check the Store to\npursue your adventures?\" It's also been moved to its own individual section in\nplayer libraries, listed under \"inactive games\". Apparently booting the game\ndirectly from the installation directory will still launch the game, but only\nin a demo mode.\n\nThe news has, unsurprisingly, gone down very poorly. \"This was the saddest and\nmost ruthless decision I've ever seen in gaming history,\" one Redditor\ncommented after a screenshot began circulating on the site. \"I will always\nfight for digital media, I love all the advantages it gives to users all\naround the world. But this... we need protection on the national or European\nlevel, that when we purchase something, we need to have lifetime access to it.\nNo matter what.\"\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM pcgamer\n\n(Image credit: Ubisoft)\n\nA further Reddit user called it \"really abhorrent behavior that needs to stop\nbeing legal,\" with another writing, \"In an ideal world, revoking a license\nlike this should entitle the buyer to a refund. I'm not sure why they're even\nbothering doing this. The game isn't playable anymore, so what exactly is the\nharm in keeping the game available for download for those who have purchased\nit? Server space? Is Ubisoft really that cheap?\"\n\nIt's worth noting that it appears you can technically still download the game\non Steam, but any attempt to play is followed-up with a request to input a\ngame key\n\nNow it's one thing to just delist a game and still allow owners to download\nand boot it up if they want\u2014even if the game is technically dead\u2014but it's\nanother thing to revoke the licence to the files entirely. It came very close\nto putting a dent in plans to bring fan servers to the game, but one project\nappears to still be chugging along.\n\n## PC Gamer Newsletter\n\nSign up to get the best content of the week, and great gaming deals, as picked\nby the editors.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nThe Crew Unlimited Discord server is housing a project called The Crew\nOffline+Online Server Emulation, intended to bring the game back to a playable\nstate \"both offline locally and online\" via a community server\u2014no cracking or\npirating involved. I asked project member ChemicalFlood how it had impacted\ntheir plans:\n\n\"We are deeply saddened by Ubisoft's choice to start revoking licences to this\ngame when people have paid hard-earned cash for it,\" he told me. \"In regard to\nthe project, yes! We are currently working on a Server Emulator as opposed to\ncracking the game. Before the shutdown of the servers, we took the precaution\nof capturing Network Communications Data. Had we not done this, the project\nwould [have] sadly fallen over and this game would [have] been lost forever.\n\n\"Thankfully, a server emulation is still possible. But no other patch is\npossible due to the high amount of DRM placed into the game by Ubisoft, which\nsadly has restricted our ability to work on a fix, but not impossible!\"\n\nI also asked ChemicalFlood how the news had gone down with fans and The Crew\nUnlimited Discord:\n\n\"Obviously, Ubisoft pulling the game licences has left a sour taste in every\ngamer's mouth and it has unfortunately made it so the game cannot even be\nlaunched without it turning into a restricted trial mode. However, we can\nbypass this new change made by them without having to modify the existing game\nfiles, so the project is still on track!\n\n\"It should go without saying that, by any means, the fact that the community\nhas to implement something like this to continue playing something we all paid\nfor is abysmal, especially something of this magnitude. We of course love the\ngame and want it to be played for generations to come (my own son loved\nplaying this on the PlayStation, 'loved' being the keyword!) But Ubisoft\nshould [have] implemented an offline mode and they could [have]! The offline\nmode already exists in the files, we just can't turn it on because of the DRM\nin place.\n\n\"We hope that the Stopkillinggames campaign will mean that the communities and\nfans of these games will not be expected to be able to restore every single\nonline-only game like this.\"\n\n(Image credit: Ubisoft)\n\nI've requested comment from Ubisoft regarding the situation and will update if\nI hear back. I'll be interested to know if the publisher provides any solid\nreason for being extra thorough with its shutdown process. There's a good\nchance it has something to do with licensing\u2014there are a good deal of licensed\nsongs in The Crew, not to mention all of the real-world car manufacturers\npresent, too. It could make for a sticky situation keeping the files around,\nand perhaps it was easier to try and kill the whole thing instead.\n\nRegardless of the reason, it's an ever-looming reminder of how fragile digital\nownership can be. A study by the Video Game History Foundation last year found\nthat around 87% of games are unplayable without diving into some kind of\npiracy or fan-created archive, and that number could even worsen as physical\ndiscs slowly die out. But preservation is becoming a bigger topic, one that's\nnow being taken more seriously as a means of conserving the medium.\n\nEarlier this month, YouTuber Ross Scott launched a campaign called \"Stop\nKilling Games\" with The Crew as its primary example. His hope is to eventually\nwin a legal victory that would require publishers to keep their live service\ngames playable in some form after they end support, such as by releasing\nprivate servers.\n\nMollie Taylor\n\nFeatures Producer\n\nMollie spent her early childhood deeply invested in games like Killer\nInstinct, Toontown and Audition Online, which continue to form the pillars of\nher personality today.
