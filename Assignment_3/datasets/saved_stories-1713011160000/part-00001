Lots was written about Sports in its first couple of\nweeks, but I was on a blogging hiatus back then. I\u2019ve recently looked at it\nagain to see if I was too hasty or if its failings had been fixed (no to\nboth), so I figured I\u2019d write up my thoughts.\n\nI won\u2019t be saying anything about how Sports fits into the Apple sports\nuniverse; go to Jason Snell for that. And I won\u2019t be talking about how its\ndesign may be a harbinger of iOS 18; that\u2019s Lickability\u2019s baliwick. But I do\nwant to talk about its design as a sports app.\n\nYou may recall that the main selling point of Sports was its ability to give\nyou up-to-date scores. Eddy Cue said, \u201cI just want to get the damn score of\nthe game.\u201d That\u2019s Apple marketing at its best: it\u2019s short, pithy, and it\ndirects you to the app\u2019s best feature, the presentation of today\u2019s scores.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to set up Sports to follow your favorite leagues/conferences and\nteams, and once that\u2019s done the presentation of scores is logical. Games being\nplayed in your chosen leagues are displayed generally in chronological order,\nbut the games with your favorite teams are floated to the top. That\u2019s the\nright way to do it.\n\nBut scores are only part of what a good sports app is about. Sports apps are\nused not only when you can\u2019t watch a game and want to be kept plugged in,\nthey\u2019re also used\u2014even more often used, I think\u2014to give you background\ninformation on the game you\u2019re currently watching. Announcements during a\nbroadcast are ephemeral, but a sports app can tell you how many fouls Nikola\nJoki\u0107 has at any time.\n\n^1 And this is where Sports falls down.\n\nIn basketball, for example, the box score statistics are thin. There\u2019s no info\non free throws, steals, blocks, turnovers, or personal fouls. League standings\nare missing common stats like the home/away record, record over the last 10\ngames, and win/loss streaks, These are things fans want and that other sports\napps provide. No amount of beautiful presentation is going to make up for\nmissing data.\n\nAnd, weirdly for an Apple app, the presentation isn\u2019t beautiful\u2014it\u2019s actually\nawful. Here\u2019s a screenshot of the box score from last night\u2019s Chicago\nBulls/Detroit Pistons game:\n\nLike many sports apps, Sports splits the box score into starters and bench\nplayers (during a game, the players on the court have marks next to their\nnames). Apple\u2019s designers decided to put the headers only at the top of the\nStarters portion of the table, which I would applaud if they\u2019d aligned the\ncolumns of the Bench portion of the table with the columns of the Starters\nportion. But they didn\u2019t. Bench rebounds, for example, are more or less under\nthe PTS header. This is not how you present a table of numbers, and it\u2019s\ninconceivable to me that anyone would look at this mess and give it a pass.\n\nThe programming problem here is obvious. Although the use of a single header\nsuggests this is meant to be seen as a single table, inside the app the\nStarters and Bench parts are two separate tables. The column spacing of the\nStarters table is based on widths that include the headers (several of which\nare wider than the data below them), and the column spacing of the Bench table\nis based on widths of the data alone. Instead of looking at both tables,\ngetting the maximum width of each column, and applying that to both tables,\nthe programmers simply allowed the tables to be formatted separately, thus\nsaving themselves at least five lines of code.\n\nAgain, did nobody at Apple look at this before putting it in the App Store?\nAnd has nobody looked at it in the seven weeks since?\n\nI admit I may be unduly irritated by this because I spent a lot of my career\nmaking tables of figures and doing my best to make them easy to read. But\nbefore you dismiss me as a crank, look at what happens when you swipe on the\ntables left and right to see the additional stats. They get even further\nmisaligned because the two tables don\u2019t scroll together.\n\nWhen you use a single header, you\u2019re telling the reader that they\u2019re looking\nat a single table. But this design cheats the reader.\n\nI\u2019ve used several sports apps over the years. Many of them are crappy and fill\nyour small screen with ads. A good Apple Sports app would fill a real need.\nBut I can\u2019t use it until it stops offending me.\n\n  1. My examples are going to be about basketball because that\u2019s the sport I care about the most. \u21a9\n\nPrevious post\n\n# Site search\n\n# Meta\n\n  * drdrang at leancrew\n  * Blog archive\n  * RSS feed\n  * JSON feed\n  * Mastodon\n  * GitHub repositories\n\n# Recent posts\n\n  * A tardy assessment of the Apple Sports app\n  * Counting poker hands\n  * My 2024 Eclipse\n  * Moment diagrams for continuous beams\n  * Moment diagrams for simply supported beams\n  * Structural continuity and the Francis Scott Key Bridge\n  * My Mac 40th anniversary draft\n  * A Typinator snippet for plotting\n  * Ladders and friction\n  * Again with man pages and BBEdit\n  * Holes in the Wolfram Knowledgebase\n  * Dates, triangles, and Python\n\n# Credits\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0\nUnported License.\n\n\u00a9 2005\u20132023, Dr. Drang\n\n", "frontpage": false}
