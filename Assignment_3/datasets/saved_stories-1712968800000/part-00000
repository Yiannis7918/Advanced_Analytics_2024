Between career obligations, socializing with\nfriends and family, and our own personal development, optimizing how we use\nour time seems to be the challenge of the 21st century.\n\nI am no productivity guru, but I\u2019ve spent a considerable amount of time\nstudying how people get things done and how people manage their time.\nUnfortunately, I haven\u2019t found a silver bullet. There is no single way that\nwill allow you to get more done overnight.\n\nHowever, there are a few frameworks I\u2019ve found that can start moving you in\nthe right direction. It might seem odd that I am talking about productivity on\na financial blog, but I believe that your income is the most important\ncomponent of your financial success. And, if you want more income, increasing\nyour productivity is one of the best ways to have more career success and,\nideally, more income.\n\nWith that being said, let\u2019s think about how you get through your to-do list.\n\n## How Do You Get Through Your To Do List?\n\nImagine you are a financial advisor that comes into the office on a Monday\nmorning with the following to do list:\n\n  * Call back a client related to a question about their financial plan\n  * Setup a meeting with a prospect\n  * Create content to market your services on social media\n  * Spend 1 hour doing continuing education on an investment-related topic\n\nWhich of these items should you do first? Should you do the one that takes the\nleast amount of time, the one that\u2019s the most important, or the one that is\nmost likely to increase this year\u2019s profits?\n\nWhatever you choose, this class of problem falls under the what is known as\nscheduling theory, or the science of finding the optimal order to do a given\nset of tasks. Though you may have never heard of scheduling theory before, I\nknow you know the concept well. We all must make decisions under uncertainty\nbased on what we have to do at any given moment. This is why the study of how\nto get things done (aka scheduling theory) is so important.\n\nThere\u2019s good news and bad news about scheduling theory. The good news is that\nfor some set of tasks, there is an optimal solution for which order you\ncomplete them in. However, the bad news is that this isn\u2019t true for all sets\nof tasks.\n\nSome scheduling problems have no optimal solution. These problems are what\ncomputer scientists call \u201cintractable.\u201d How many scheduling problems are\nintractable? The vast majority. As Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths stated in\nAlgorithms to Live By:\n\n> Of the 93% of problems that we do understand, however, the news isn\u2019t great:\n> only 9% of them can be solved efficiently, and the other 84% have proven\n> intractable. In other words, most scheduling problems admit no ready\n> solution. If trying to perfectly manage your calendar feels overwhelming,\n> maybe that\u2019s because it actually is.\n\nNote that this 84% intractable figure includes the set of problems that\ninvolve multiple individuals completing tasks in a team setting. When you\nremove those, the figure that is intractable (for an individual completing a\nset of tasks) isn\u2019t quite so high.\n\nBut, before you get discouraged, keep in mind that many sets of tasks still\nhave an optimal solution if you follow the right strategy. Let\u2019s look at some\nof those now.\n\n## Which Scheduling Strategies Are Out There?\n\nWhen it comes to figuring out the ideal order to complete a set of tasks,\nthere are a few different strategies you can employ:\n\n  * First Come, First Serve: This strategy involves completing your tasks in the order you receive them. No emphasis is placed on a task\u2019s due date, importance, or expected completion time.\n\n    * Pros: Fairness (tasks are completed in the order received).\n    * Cons: Slow and Doesn\u2019t Prioritize (some tasks can take a long time and some can be missed altogether).\n  * Earliest Due Date: This strategy involves completing the task with the earliest due date first and then going on to the next one. No emphasis is placed on when a task is received, it\u2019s importance, or it\u2019s expected completion time.\n\n    * Pros: Prompt (prevents tasks from being completed late)\n    * Cons: Doesn\u2019t Prioritize (important tasks may not get the attention they deserve)\n  * Priority Scheduling (Highest to Lowest): This strategy involves focusing on the highest priority tasks first, then moving down the list. No emphasis is placed on when a task is received or it\u2019s expected completion time.\n\n    * Pros: Prioritizes (cares about a task\u2019s importance)\n    * Cons: Slow (can leave quicker tasks longer in the queue than necessary)\n  * Shortest Processing Time: This involves completing tasks based solely on how long they take to finish. While this will minimize the size of someone\u2019s task list, it also de-emphasizes the importance and priority of tasks.\n\n    * Pros: Fast, High Throughput (completes more tasks in less time)\n    * Cons: Doesn\u2019t Prioritize (can miss tasks and not emphasize important tasks). Heavier Mental Load (this strategy requires the ability to switch in and out of different tasks quickly, which is not ideal for everyone.)\n  * Weighted Shortest Processing Time: Similar to the shortest processing time strategy, this strategy completes tasks based on how long they take to finish, but changes the ordering of the tasks based on their importance. For example, imagine three tasks with the following expected completion times:\n\n    * Task A (20 minutes)\n    * Task B (2 minutes)\n    * Task C (60 minutes)\n  * The Shortest Processing Time strategy would tell you to do Task B, then Task A, and, finally, Task C. But what if we could include weights (1-10) on these tasks based on their relative importance? Let\u2019s assume the following weights for each task:\n\n    * Task A (20 minutes), Weight = 2\n    * Task B (2 minutes), Weight = 1\n    * Task C (60 minutes), Weight = 8\n  * Now if we divide the weight by the expected time to complete the task we would get:\n\n    * Task A = 2/20 = 0.1\n    * Task B = 1/2 = 0.5\n    * Task C = 8/60 = 0.13\n  * Using this new weighted measure, the Weighted Shortest Processing Time strategy would tell you to do Task B, then Task C, and, finally, Task A. Since Task C is 4x as important as Task A, it is prioritized though it will take 3x as long to complete.\n\n    * Pros: Generally Fast, Prioritizes (Gets more tasks done and cares about a task\u2019s importance)\n    * Cons: Higher Ongoing Costs (takes more time to organize task list as you must weight and then re-order the items on the list as new tasks are added)\n  * Though the Weighted Shortest Processing Time strategy will take you a bit longer to organize, it also might just be the best scheduling strategy out there. Once again from Algorithms to Live By:\n\n> In fact, the weighted version of Shortest Processing Time is a pretty good\n> candidate for the best all-purpose scheduling strategy in the face of\n> uncertainty.\n\nThough the Weighted Shortest Processing Time strategy is great to use, how do\nyou know if it\u2019s right for you? For this we turn to our next section.\n\n## Which Scheduling Strategy is Right For You?\n\nFinding the right task completion strategy is something that is very dependent\non the context of your work. If you\u2019re an air traffic controller, minimizing\nthe number of incomplete tasks (e.g. cancelled flights) is probably more\nimportant than aiming for the shortest completion time (e.g. minimizing\ndelays). However, if you work in a hospital, emphasizing priority (e.g. a\npatient with no heartbeat) is more important than the number of procedures you\ncomplete in a day.\n\nEvery industry and every job has a different value system that they apply to\ntheir tasks. Once you know the value system you are working under, then it\nbecomes much easier to pick the right strategy for getting things done.\n\nA great example of this comes from Matthias Lux, a data scientist at Uber, who\nwrote about how Uber had to look beyond the average outcome when evaluating\nnew algorithms that would match riders with drivers. Matching riders with\ndrivers is a kind of scheduling problem since each rider can be thought of as\na task (with a wait time) that needs to be completed by the driver.\n\nHow should Uber allocate their drivers to riders? A simple solution is to find\na strategy that leads to the lowest average wait time. This seems great at\nfirst glance, until you realize how it might impact someone living in a less\nvisited location. If you create an algorithm that directs all of your drivers\ntoward riders in the most populated parts of a city, this will decrease the\naverage wait time across the system, but will also increase the wait time for\na small number of riders in remote areas.\n\nUber could find this acceptable, or it could not, depending on its goals. If\nit wants as many riders as possible on the platform, then increasing wait time\nby 2 minutes for those in downtown might be worth it if it also decreases wait\ntime by 10 minutes for those on the outskirts of the city.\n\nEither way, everything comes back to what goals you are trying to accomplish.\nOnce you define your goals, then you can determine which scheduling strategy\nis right for your situation.\n\nNow that we\u2019ve discussed which strategy might be right for you, let\u2019s wrap\nthings up by considering why higher productivity isn\u2019t always the ideal\nsolution.\n\n## When Getting More Done Isn\u2019t Actually the Answer\n\nAn implicit assumption I\u2019ve made throughout this post is that getting more\ndone is always the right answer to your problems. But, it may not be.\n\nIn Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals, Oliver Burkeman argues\nthat the real solution to getting more done is accepting that you won\u2019t get\neverything done. Instead, Burkeman believes that we should focus on getting\nthe most meaningful things done instead of getting everything done. As\nBurkeman states:\n\n> I\u2019ve been writing as if the efficiency trap were a simple matter of\n> quantity: you have too much to do, so you try to fit more in, but the ironic\n> result is that you end up with more to do. The worst aspect of the trap\n> though, is that it\u2019s also a matter of quality. The harder you struggle to\n> fit everything in, the more time you\u2019ll find yourself spending on the least\n> meaningful things...If you never stop to ask yourself if the sacrifice is\n> worth it, your days will automatically begin to fill not just with more\n> things, but more trivial or tedious things, because they\u2019ve never had to\n> clear hurdle of being judged more important than something else.\n>\n> Commonly, these will be things other people want you to do to make their\n> lives easier, and, which you didn\u2019t think to try and resist. The more\n> efficient you get, the more you become \u201ca limitless reservoir for other\n> peoples\u2019 expectations,\u201d in the words of management expert Jim Benson.\n\nAs one of my mentors told me early in my career, \u201cThe reward for work is more\nwork.\u201d\n\nMy solution to this problem takes it a bit further than Burkeman. Not only\nshould you prioritize the right things, but you should also ensure that\nthere\u2019s always some slack in the system. In other words, make sure you\u2019re\nalmost never fully utilized. Why?\n\nBecause when you\u2019re already at 100% of your operating capacity and an\nunexpected emergency hits, the whole system fails. You\u2019ve probably felt this\nfeeling before. It\u2019s overwhelming and you can\u2019t figure out what to do next.\nIt\u2019s the same thing that happens to your computer when you have too many\nprograms open. It doesn\u2019t know which program to prioritize, so it freezes, and\nthen crashes.\n\nThe same thing happens with people when we get too busy. We don\u2019t know what to\ndo and we can crash. Unfortunately, that single crash can decrease\nproductivity more than a slow day once in a while. That\u2019s why your goal should\nbe to be about 80%-85% utilized. You may have a less productive day here or\nthere, but this slight inefficiency will prevent larger failures when fires\ninevitably pop up from time to time. I firmly believe this is one of the\nreasons why I haven\u2019t burned out despite working full-time and blogging every\nsingle week for over 7 years now.\n\nMy secret to getting so much done is rarely operating at full capacity. My\nphilosophy on this is simple\u2014if you take care of the days, the years take care\nof themselves.\n\nWe know that this is right intrinsically, but many of us choose to ignore it\nto our own detriment. If I told a runner to sprint at 100% effort, they might\nbe able to sprint for a minute before they would have to slow down or stop\ncompletely. But, if told them to run at 75% of their max effort, they could go\non for hours. Same person. Same body. The only difference is what capacity\nthey are operating at.\n\nSo instead of trying to get everything done, the better solution is to get the\nright things done (at the right capacity). But figuring out what the right\nthings are is a challenge all its own.\n\nIf you enjoyed this post, check out Algorithms to Live By and Four Thousand\nWeeks, two books I highly recommend on this topic.
