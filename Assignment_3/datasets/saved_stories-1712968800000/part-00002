The plant, when completed, will make batteries for\nnearly a million electric pickup trucks each year.\n\nWhen Dugan walked in, huge wooden boxes containing battery-making machines,\nlargely shipped from overseas, were laid across the mile-long factory floor.\nBlack streaks on those wooden boxes, plus the smell, immediately raised alarm\nbells for workers. But for months, those concerns were met with little remedy\nfrom the contractors hired by BlueOval to oversee construction.\n\nDugan and scores of others now believe they are in the midst of a health\ncrisis at the site. \u201cWe don\u2019t get sick pay,\u201d Dugan said. \u201cYou\u2019re sick, you\u2019re\nout of luck.\u201d\n\nThe BlueOval SK Battery Park, billed to open in 2025, is a banner project for\nPresident Joe Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act, a program of public subsidies\nand financing to companies moving away from fossil fuels. The Department of\nEnergy has pledged to support the construction of three BlueOval plants in\nTennessee and Kentucky with a $9.2 billion low-cost loan.\n\nBut under all the high-tech green fanfare, several construction workers,\nincluding some who wished to be anonymous, say the site has been gripped by\nmold and respiratory illness\u2014medieval hazards that workers feel managers\nneglected in the pressure to quickly open the plant.\n\nJason Shaffer, a fellow member with Dugan of the International Brotherhood of\nElectrical Workers, was tasked with setting electrical wiring right above\nlaborers breaking down wooden crates. He believes that mold exposure led to\nthe illness that knocked him out of work for over a week.\n\n\u201cThree nights ago, I couldn\u2019t get air in my lungs,\" Shaffer said in early\nFebruary. \u201cI was seeing fireflies, coughing up chunks like white leather all\nnight, crawling across the floor.\u201d A nearby clinic diagnosed Shaffer with a\nbacterial infection of the lungs, but he has yet to get a diagnosis and care\nfor his mold exposure.\n\nAmid contractor companies\u2019 rush to build the plant for Ford, many have\nrequired their union workers to build on 12-hour shifts, seven days a week.\nDespite months of worker concerns, managers waited until early February to\ntake basic precautions against the mold\u2014precautions that might slow\nconstruction.\n\nThree months after workers first brought their complaints to management, the\nKentucky Education and Labor Cabinet is now investigating the issue. That\nstate agency, along with managers at BlueOval and two contracting companies,\ndid not respond to requests for comment. But the president of an electrical\ncontractor at BlueOval, in an email to a site manager which workers obtained\nand shared on Facebook, wrote he considers it \u201cinevitable\u201d that contractors\nwill finally shut down the site for a mold cleanup for \u201cmost of March.\u201d\n\nThe start of this Kentucky green jobs boom reminds Shaffer of what workers\nfaced in the years before unions: \u201cIt\u2019s production supersedes all, even life.\u201d\n\n### HIGH-TECH, OLD FOE\n\nSince construction began on the Kentucky BlueOval factory in early 2022,\nworkers have raised safety issues.\n\nElectrical workers complained to foremen about the scarce, unheated outdoor\nportajohns that contractors often left uncleaned and overflowing. The day\nbefore a state safety agency inspection last month, Shaffer says, contractors\nrolled in new portajohns. Another worker sent extensive photos to management\nof structural concerns in the building, where he had circled joints and\nsupports he considered deeply unsafe.\n\nThe building structure was largely in place by spring 2023. Soon after,\nworkers say the sub-contractor Lesco began directing laborers to haul the\nheavy equipment crates inside and break them down on the factory floor.\n\nAlthough Shaffer raised concerns about the black streaks and smell from the\nboxes early in the fall, contractors didn\u2019t shift procedure. In November, with\na cold and wet winter rolling in, the general contractor Abel decided to close\nthe huge bay doors on the building, which had previously helped keep the area\nventilated.\n\n### MOUNTING ILLNESSES\n\nThat\u2019s when workers say they started to fall sick with respiratory illnesses\nthat kept coming back. At least a few have been diagnosed with Covid or flu.\nBut others who are sick said they have tested negative for those viruses,\nwhile struggling to get mold tests. Far from their homes in this sparse\nstretch of Kentucky, on breaks between marathon shifts, many have struggled to\nget health care at all.\n\nIn December, Dugan drove to a clinic and a distant hospital where he was \u201ctold\nI had the flu, then told I had a pulmonary condition. Finally I had to go to\nthe ER in an ambulance, I couldn\u2019t breathe, and got an X ray, which found\nsomething in my lungs.\u201d\n\nWorker complaints piled up until, on December 8, Abel management hired the\nfirm Environmental Testing & Consulting of Kentucky to take \u201climited samples\u201d\nfor mold. Their report, sent to Abel less than one week later, found seven\ntypes of mold inside the wooden crates, including three in \u201cheavy\u201d\nconcentrations. It also noted an \u201cintense mold odor\u201d inside the containers.\n\nTo limit exposure, the report included a recommendation for handling the\nwooden boxes: \u201cDO NOT PUT INSIDE.\u201d\n\nWorkers say they first saw the report in early January, and Lesco management\ncontinued to bring crates inside and break them down there until early\nFebruary. In that time, Shaffer said, another 15 workers he knows on site have\nbeen ill. \u201cBasically everybody I know on the job says they\u2019ve been sick\nrepeatedly since they started here.\u201d An electrical worker, who wanted to\nremain anonymous due to concerns about his employment, said he knew 10 co-\nworkers who had taken mold spit tests in recent weeks, with five returning\npositive.\n\n### \u2018SLIGHT ODOR\u2019\n\nA January 19 notice from Abel addresses the mold concerns but seems to\ndownplay the situation, casting the odor as \u201cslight\u201d and stating that reports\nby two environmental testing agencies found the mold to be non-hazardous. The\ncompany instructed workers with pre-existing conditions or those who are\n\u201coverly sensitive to molds/dust\u201d to wear a disposable mask.\n\n## SUPPORT LABOR NOTES\n\n### BECOME A MONTHLY DONOR\n\nGive $10 a month or more and get our \"Fight the Boss, Build the Union\"\nT-shirt.\n\nPaula Schenck, environmental specialist at the University of Connecticut, said\nthat mold exposure, particularly indoors and over a long period of time, could\ncause health issues.\n\n\u201cMoldy smells and evidence of water damage does correlate with respiratory\nsymptoms in some people, irrespective of what sampling you do,\u201d she said,\nnoting that anyone who thinks they are having mold-induced respiratory issues\nshould see their doctor. \u201cEqually important, the moldy smell is an indication\nthat there are other things\u2014dust mites, critters, bacteria. There\u2019s a whole\nbiological soup that can then be aerosolized that can cause respiratory\nsymptoms.\u201d\n\nSchenck cautioned that workers\u2019 positive mold tests could only prove they\u2019d\nbeen exposed, not that mold was causing their illness. But the confirmed\npresence of mold on-site, she said, indicated the need for serious\nprecautions.\n\nWith over a 1,000 electrical workers on the BlueOval site, many spread the\nword about mounting illnesses on their breaks and over Facebook. Dugan\norganized a weekly \u201cBrotherhood Night\u201d for IBEW members to gather at a bar or\nrestaurant. Recently, that gathering became a fundraiser to help the family\nmembers of \u201csparkies\u201d laid out by illness, or who needed car repairs to move\nto a new job.\n\nAlthough Dugan, Shaffer, and other members say their union stewards on site\nhelped press their concerns to management, they say that local and\ninternational IBEW officers who visited the facility scoffed at their\nconcerns. Dugan says a local officer refused to file a grievance on his behalf\nabout the mold in January. One worker requested to stay anonymous out of\nconcern that union officials might withhold his future job placements if he\nspoke out. Officers with the IBEW local and district did not return requests\nfor comment.\n\nWhile the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration has no\nspecific standard for mold, Debbie Berkowitz, former OSHA chief of staff and\nfellow at Georgetown University\u2019s Kalmanovitz Initiative, said that OSHA could\nstill cite employers for failing to protect workers\u2019 health. OSHA recommends\nthat workers handling mold-contaminated materials be provided with an N-95\nmask, at a minimum.\n\nKentucky, however, runs its own worker safety program\u2014one that is notorious\nfor taking a more lenient and pro-industry approach to enforcement than OSHA.\nThe state\u2019s labor cabinet is now investigating the situation and visited the\nconstruction site in late January after receiving complaints from workers.\n\nRecords show that, in the past 11 months, the Kentucky agency has opened 12\ninvestigations into contractors over health or safety complaints at the\nBlueOval site. Half of those cases were closed without any penalty or finding\nof wrongdoing, and at least two were accidents that resulted in the companies\nchanging procedures; the other six investigations are still ongoing.\n\nPenalties for violations in Kentucky are lower than at the federal level, and\nthe state will only accept complaints from the workers themselves, meaning a\nwealth of non-employee complaints go ignored. In 2018, the Kentucky Center for\nInvestigative Reporting found that the agency had \u201cfailed to properly\ninvestigate nearly every single worksite death in two years,\u201d and OSHA\u2019s audit\nthat year found that the state-run agency was investigating fewer workplaces.\n\nOn February 1, local TV channel WDRB aired a story about worker mold concerns\nand illnesses at the BlueOval site. In the days after, Shaffer says, Abel\nmanagement finally started making changes. \u201cThey\u2019re handing out masks, trying\nto get more people to wear them. They say they\u2019re going to bring in a third\nparty contractor to open the boxes outside.\u201d A notice from Abel dated February\n3 says that the company will start providing workers with suits, goggles, dust\nmasks, and gloves, as well as spraying the wooden crates with a bleach\nsolution.\n\nBut according to the Environmental Testing & Consulting report, mold issues in\nBlueOval\u2019s supply chain \u201care not going to change any time soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cRoughly 1,500 out of 12,000 seaworthy metal containers are on-site as of now.\nIt may not be possible to stop this contamination from happening considering\nthe many years of planning taken to begin the construction of the battery\nplant,\u201d inspectors wrote.\n\nAlong with dozens of other workers they know, Dugan and Shaffer have\nvolunteered for layoffs and plan to move to new jobs. They expect less-\nseasoned workers will fill their shoes.\n\nA looming shortage of skilled hands has at least one contractor considering\ndirty tricks. In the internal email where Lighthouse Electric president Anton\nMikec said a March BlueOval shutdown looked \u201cinevitable\u201d for mold cleanup, he\nalso asked for a list of BlueOval workers. His goal: make sure to \u201cturn them\naround at the door\u201d at his company\u2019s Indiana jobsite, so they\u2019d be more likely\nto stay laid off and hungry to work at BlueOval in April.\n\nTo stop that kind of opportunistic blacklisting by construction bosses, IBEW\nand many building trades have won contract rights to a union hiring hall that\nhandles worker dispatch. In the new manufacturing building boom, it may take\nunion pressure to enforce that hard-won right.\n\n### CANARY IN THE BATTERY PLANT\n\nSince it passed in August 2022, the Biden administration has trumpeted the\nInflation Reduction Act as a crowning achievement, allocating a landmark $369\nbillion to climate and clean energy programs. At $9.2 billion, the BlueOval\nloan is not only the largest IRA incentive, but also the largest financial\nbacking offered by the federal government to an automaker since the 2009\nfinancial crisis.\n\nThe state of Kentucky has also shown unprecedented support for the project in\nthe form of a $250 million upfront forgivable loan. According to the non-\nprofit government watchdog Good Jobs First, the loan is the \u201cbiggest economic\ndevelopment deal in Kentucky history,\u201d as well as \u201clikely the most generous\ncorporate subsidy the state has ever offered.\u201d\n\nThese public subsidies have gently encouraged union labor, but not mandated\nit. Ford has not committed to bring BlueOval manufacturing workers under its\nmaster contract with the United Auto Workers, even after the union\u2019s 2023\nstrike won unionization of similar battery plants at GM and Stellantis.\n\nBut even with fully union construction at the BlueOval Kentucky site, workers\nsaid the grueling shifts and outbreak of illness left them worried about the\ndirection of the building boom.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all scared because we know we could be carrying mold on our clothes\nback to our families, exposing the community,\u201d said Dugan. \u201cThis is corporate\nAmerica walking all over us.\u201d\n\nSchuyler Mitchell is an investigative reporter and editor based in Brooklyn.\nKeith Brower Brown is Labor Notes' Labor-Climate organizer.\n\nA version of this article appeared in Labor Notes Issue #540-541, March/April\n2024.
