In this respect, they\ncontain elements of archaeology albeit in an unscientific manner. The Elder\nScrolls franchise is no different. This article will analyse the various\nburial practices in the Elder Scrolls games, finding parallels between several\nreal-life cultures from medieval Europe to Ancient Egypt.\n\n## THE ELDER SCROLLS\n\nThe Elder Scrolls franchise has been running since 1994 and consists of eight\ngames developed and published by Bethesda Softworks (1994\u20131998) and Bethesda\nGame Studios (2002\u2013present). It is set in the fictional continent of Tamriel\non the world of Nirn and has a rich lore and history behind it, with races and\ncultures adjacent to real-world cultures \u2013 a typical feature in the fantasy\ngenre. The games follow an open-world roleplaying style in which the player\ncharacter typically faces existential threats in the provinces of Tamriel,\nusually of divine origin from the lore\u2019s pantheon of deities.\n\nThe Elder Scrolls are full of historical comparisons: the Nords resemble the\nViking age Scandinavia, the Imperials are the Romans, and the Breton are\nmedieval Celtic peoples. The Wood-Elves and High-Elves have been compared to\nindigenous North Americans/ Mongolians and Imperial China respectively, with\nsome Tolkien influence, while the Dark Elves bear a resemblance to the Ancient\nNear East, and the Red Guards to medieval North Africa. The Argonions resemble\nMesoamerican cultures living in jungles and the Khajit are like a variety of\ncultures from nomadic cultures in Eurasia and settled ones from the Indian\nsubcontinent (Schuhart, 2021).\n\nArchaeology and roleplaying games are inextricably linked \u2013 player characters\nwill enter ancient ruins and caves to seek ancient treasures and mysteries.\nThese often include tombs and burial grounds (Fig. 1) full of the undead and\ndraugr. In this respect, funerary archaeology or the burial of the dead is\npresent everywhere in the game (Parker Pearson, 2010). This article will\nexamine the funerary and burial practices in the Elder Scrolls games and look\nat real-world parallels. Archaeology is not new to the franchise, with both\nthe in-canon excavations and texts as well as projects like the Skyrim\nArchaeological Survey (2020).\n\nFigure 1. Concept art of a Nordic tomb (Nordic Ruins, by Adamowicz, 2008;\nBethesda Softworks). Source: Bethesda Softworks, via The Unofficial Elder\nScrolls Pages (https://en.uesp.net/).\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nThis study was undertaken using the games The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind (2002),\nOblivion (2006) and Skyrim (2011) as well as the associated download content\n(DLC) of each game. Comparison of in-game burial practices was done with real\nworld practices using archaeological and historical literature.\n\n## DRAUGR AND DRAGON CULTS\n\nThe Draugr (Fig. 2) are undead warriors of the Nord race who most commonly\ninhabit Skyrim and culturally resemble early medieval Scandinavian cultures.\nThey are followers of the dragon priests or nobility who are sealed inside\ntombs with them. An in-game book, Amongst the Draugr by Bernedette Bantien,\nwhich resembles a piece of anthropological/archaeological research on the\nDraugr observes these beings waking up daily to clean and worship the dragon\npriest, transferring energy to the priests to maintain their eternal afterlife\n(Bantien, 2012). This is a form of retainer sacrifice or the act of killing\nservants and burying them with their lords so they might join them in the\nafterlife. While human sacrifice was found in Norse burials, it is more common\non a smaller scale than observed in Skyrim, and sacrifices were usually young\nwomen and often decapitated (Price, 2012: 266). Egyptian burials often\ncontained figurines that functioned as servants for the afterlife, known as\nshabti (Taylor, 2001: 112). Another non-biological example of servants\naccompanying their overlords is the terracotta warriors of Qin Shi Huang in\nnorthern China (Man, 2007; Rawson, 2023: 348).\n\nFigure 2. A Draugr during battle. Source: UESPWiki (screen capture from the\ngame).\n\nIn the game, the dragon priests and levelled draugr bosses inhabit the main\nantechamber of the tombs are the remains of cult leaders or local nobility;\nSeveral of these are named and have associated quests. They are often guarding\na wall covered in script resembling Norse runes, known as a \u2018Word Wall\u2019\n(Williams, 2012).\n\nIn the in-game book Cadaver Preparation Findings by an Unnamed Necromancer, it\nis noted that the Draugr are mummified by removing certain organs that \u201cno\nlonger serve any function and only encumber the cadaver\u201d and the skin is\nremoved to prevent rot. Organ or viscera removal is a feature of Ancient\nEgyptian mummification; burial urns resembling Egyptian canopic jars can be\nfound commonly in the tombs of Skyrim (Taylor, 2001: 54). The method of skin\nremoval resembles no real-world methods of mummification; besides, Skyrim\u2019s\ncold climate would have contributed to the preservation of the skin as it did\nwith the Iron Age Scythian Pazyrk burials, in which the mummies still had\ntheir skin and even tattoos (Parker Pearson, 2010: 61; Cunliffe, 2019: 199).\n\nDraugr are typically found laid in grouped chambers horizontally in shelving\nbuilt into the wall of tombs; the monumental tombs vary in form and size. They\ncarry corroded iron axes and swords, resembling those used by Norse warriors\n(Pederen, 2012). There are 44 tombs on the map in Skyrim and Solstheim, with\nforms resembling temples (Bleak Falls Barrow), cities (Saarthal), and barrows\n(Shroud Heath Barrow) (Skyrim Archaeological Survey, 2020). Norse chambered\ntombs have been found but many of the more prominent examples are from the\nNeolithic and Bronze Age (Parker Pearson, 2010; Price, 2012: 263; Cooney,\n2023). The complexity of the tombs found in Skyrim is likely to be a decision\nbased on gameplay rather than practicality, but the closest real-world\nexamples are that of the tomb of Qin Shi Huang and those of the Ancient\nEgyptians (Taylor, 2001: 150; Rawson, 2023: 353).\n\n### Red Eagle\n\nMost of the uniquely named draugr or dragon priests (quest bosses) are of\nNordic descent. The one exception to this is one named \u2018Red Eagle\u2019, associated\nwith the quest \u2018The Legend of Red Eagle\u2019 (Elder Scrolls Fandom, 2023). Red\nEagle is from an ethnic group known as the Reachmen from western Skyrim, a\ngroup who has clashed with the empire and the Nords on several occasions and\nfollowed their own cultures and practices \u2013 namely, the veneration of\nHargravens (witch-like creatures) and the ritual raising of Briar hearts, a\nform of undead. Red Eagle bears similarity to the tale of King Arthur, who\nfought off invaders and promised to return as well.\n\nOverall, despite the Nord culture\u2019s resemblances to early medieval\nScandinavian and Germanic cultures. The combination of mummification, large-\nscale monumental tombs, and master-retainer sacrifice (notably only observed\nin Early Dynastic tombs), bears more in common with the burial practices of\nthe Ancient Egyptians (Taylor, 2001).\n\n## MORROWIND ANCESTRAL TOMBS\n\nAncestor Tombs are found around Morrowind, usually guarded by Ancestor Ghosts\nor Undead. The player can access them to find loot. Ancestor worship is noted\nin most cultures in Tamriel but in Morrowind it is a particular point of\ncontention between the tribunal religion of the settled towns (of whom the\ngods were once ancestors themselves) and the nomadic Ashlander tribes\n(UESPWiki, 2024a).\n\nAncestor worship is something that has been found in various cultures varying\nchronologically and geographically from the Romans to groups in Africa, the\nAmericas and Asia (Steadman et al., 1996; Janelli & Janelli, 2000).\n\n### Falkreath Graveyard\n\nThe graveyard at Falkreath (Fig. 3) is an in-game contemporary cemetery that\nis still in use and maintained by Runil, the local priest of Arkay (God of the\nCycle of Birth and Death) and local monk, Kust; both these NPCs reside in the\nHall of the Dead (see below). It is one of two graveyards found in game, with\nthe other being Hamvir\u2019s Rest. When entering Falkreath for the first time, the\nplayer can witness a funeral taking place; the funeral is of a young child and\nconsists of Runil and the two parents. It is difficult to ascertain whether\nthis small funeral is a norm or whether it is due to the young age of the\nperson. Archaeologically, child burials are often seen as \u201cdeviant\u201d and to be\navoided, possibly explaining the small funeral (Millett & Gowland, 2015;\nEvans, 2020: 58).\n\nFigure 3. The graveyard at Falkreath. Source: Elder Scroll Fandom (screen\ncapture from the game).\n\nThe graveyard bears a resemblance to medieval European cemeteries and contains\nmany worn graves but includes those of heroes such as Hoag Merkiller thus it\nis considered an honour to be buried here (Elder Scrolls Fandom, 2024; Evans,\n2020). Nord beliefs of the afterlife pertain that warriors travel to\nSovengarde after death, an afterlife like that of the Norse Valhalla (Schodt,\n2012: 220). The player can enter here in the quests \u2018The World-Eater\u2019s Eyrie\u2019\nand \u2018Sovngarde\u2019. When entering, the player can encounter several NPCs who have\ndied in the game as well characters from the game lore and Tsun, Nord god of\ntrials.\n\n### Hall of the Dead\n\nHalls of the Dead are buildings encountered in most major settlements in\nSkyrim. These mausoleums are built for the dead to be laid to rest and be\nprepared to undergo funerary rites; they are usually run by a priest of Arkay.\nThe Hall of the Dead in Whiterun and Solitude has access to the catacombs\n(UESPWiki, 2022). When an NPC who is associated with the settlement dies, the\nplayer can locate their body in this area afterwards.\n\nThe burial rites and treatment of the (in-game) contemporary Nordic dead vary\nacross Skyrim from shared tombs such as in Whiterun/Solitude to inhumations\nsuch as those in Falkreath Cemetery. The reason for this difference is unclear\nand never explained in the game but we can hypothesise it being due to reasons\nsuch as lack of space or unsuitable geography for burials in these locations.\nHowever, Whiterun is located on vast grasslands, so this reason is improbable.\nIt may be a cultural reason with some parts of Skyrim having more Imperial\ninfluence than others.\n\n### Tombs of Emperors and Holy Knights\n\nIn The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, the player undertakes a quest \u2018Blood of the\nDivines\u2019, to find the sacred armour of the Tiber Septim in Sancre Tor (Golden\nHill) (UESPWiki, 2024c). The site has a long relationship with the imperial\ncivilisation, dating back to the founding of the first empire by St Alessia.\nThe site was eventually abandoned by Tiber Septim, founder of the third empire\nand contains the tombs of Reman (second Empire) emperors (in-game book The\nLegendary Sancre Tor). The tombs, of which there are five, belong to Reman I,\nReman II and Reman III, plus two unmarked tombs (Fig. 4). The tombs are\ninscribed as such (UESPWiki, 2021):\n\nReman \u2014 \u201cHere lies Reman of Cyrodiil. He defeated the Akaviri Horde and\nbrought peace to Tamriel. 2762.\u201c\n\nReman II \u2014 \u201cHere lies Reman II of Cyrodiil, crowned Emperor of Tamriel in the\nyear 2812. He fell in battle against the Dark Elves, in the fifty-seventh year\nof his age, after a reign of thirty-nine years and eight months wanting a\nday.\u201c\n\nReman III \u2014 \u201cHere lies Reman III, last Emperor of the Cyrodiils, the scourge\nof the Dark Elves, who was cruelly slain by treachery, in the year 2920. He\nreigned forty-three years.\u201c\n\nSarcophagi like this appeared in the early Christian Byzantine transition and\nwere typically reserved for the imperial family or martyrs (Chalkia, 2015:\n57).\n\nFigure 4. The tombs of the Reman emperors in Sancre Tor. Source: UESPWiki\n(screen capture from the game).\n\nThis matches with the next set of Sarcophagi found from the Knights of the\nNine DLC (2006). The knights they contain are part of the eponymous Knights of\nthe Nine, an order dedicated to gathering the relics of the crusader, a set of\narmour worn by Pelinal Whitestrake, a legendary warrior with parallels to\nAchilles. The knights themselves bear a resemblance to the real-life holy\norders the Templars combined with elements of the Arthurian knights of the\nRound Table (Jones, 2018). Templar burials have been found in England in 2021\n(Holder, 2021). The tombs here are effigy tombs, a common occurrence during\nthe high/later medieval period (1000\u20131500 CE). Effigy tombs are monuments to\nthe elite dead, depicting the deceased in a supine position holding an object\nor artefact; in this case a sword (Orme, 2021: 348; Williams, 2014). It is\nunclear who made the tombs, but it was likely they were commissioned by Sir\nAmiel Lannus, the last surviving member of the order.\n\n## NECROMANCY\n\nIt is impossible to discuss death in a fantasy setting without mentioning\nnecromancy. Necromancy is defined as the practice of communicating with the\ndead to foresee the future or, more generally, black magic (Cambridge\nDictionary, 2024). This practice dates to antiquity and has been found in\nAncient Egypt, Babylonia, Greece, Rome, and China. In Ancient Greece, people\nwould travel to the Neckromanteion, where they took part in complex rituals\ninvolving psychological and physical preparation including a specialised diet\n(broad beans, milk, oysters, honey, pork, barely bread), as well as chanting\nand rituals; then the people entering a soundless room where a figurine was\nmanipulated with pulleys and levers to speak to them (Aggaili, 2015: 31).\nThere are also accounts of it dating from the medieval and renaissance eras\nand relying on plants from the nightshade family to create hallucinogenic\naffects. In the contemporary world, the use of Ouija boards and s\u00e9ances\ncontinues the practice.\n\nIn modern fantasy, necromancy concerns the raising of dead thralls using black\nmagic and achieving immortality through lichdom. Immortality has famously been\nsought by philosophers and emperors such as Qin Shi Huang (Man, 2007). In The\nElder Scrolls, in-game attitudes to necromancy vary from province to province,\nwith some areas being accommodating while others treat it as a taboo. The\nElder Scrolls IV: Oblivion depicts necromancy as taboo and involves a quest\nwhereupon the player faces the king of the necromancers Mannimarco during the\nMages Guild questline (UESPWiki, 2023a). The player is unable to use\nnecromancy without obtaining a special item, the Staff of Worms. In Skyrim,\nnecromancy can be used by the player as part of the conjuration magic school,\nthough there are several quests and encounters in which necromancers are\nvillains (UESPWiki, 2023b). In the real world, there is archaeological\nevidence of preventing the dead from resurrecting; for instance, the practice\nof mutilating corpses to stop them from rising as revenants has been noted in\na possible case study in the deserted medieval village of Wharram Percy in\nEngland (Mays et al., 2017).\n\nFigure 5. Cadlew Chapel, a chapel that has been desecrated by necromancers for\nrituals. Source: UESPWiki (screen capture from the game).\n\n### City of the Dead\n\nDuring the Shivering Isles DLC, the player can encounter the ruined city of\nVitharn. The ruin is inhabited by the ghosts of its past inhabitants being\nattacked by ghosts of a tribe of Fanatics (in-game book Fall of Vitharn by an\nUnknown Author). These are cursed by the island\u2019s mad god Daedra. The main\nzones of the city are its Keep, Bailey, Mausoleum, Sump and Reservoir\n(UESPWiki, 2024b). In the centre of the Mausoleum sits a brazier (marked by an\n\u2018E\u2019 in Fig. 6). In the Mausoleum\u2019s western wing, there are the coffins for\nCountess Sheen-In-Glade and Count Csaran Vitharn, separated by a glass display\nwith jewellery (Fig. 6: C). The eastern wing contains coffins for Countess\nJideen and Count Cesrien Vitharn, with a bit more jewellery (Fig. 6: D).\n\nFigure 6. A map and guide to Vitharns mausoleum. Source: UESPWiki (2024c).\n\nThe richness of the tombs (Fig. 7) and the jewellery found is indicative of\nthe noble birth of the deceased within. The style of the coffins bears\nsimilarity to the imperial tombs of the Reman emperors mentioned before. The\ntwo possible explanations of this may be due to meta reasons related to game\ndesign or it could be postulated that the rulers of Vitharn saw themselves as\nequal to or higher than the god ruler of the Shivering Isles, Sheogorath. In\nworld history, many emperors were thought to be divine, and this may have\nexplained this similarity with the count\u2019s attempt at usurpation and hubris\n(Lieven, 2022).\n\nFigure 7. The mausoleum of Vitharn. Source: UESPWiki (screen capture from the\ngame).\n\n### Mammoth Graveyards\n\nIn Skyrim, players can encounter roving bands of giants herding mammoths.\nGiants are tall humanoids who stand between 11 and 12 feet tall. They are not\na playable race but are encountered by the player in the plains of White Run\n(UESPWiki, 2024d). The player can encounter the Camp of Secunda\u2019s Kiss,\nlocated southwest of Whiterun in which several Mammoth skulls can be found\nwith carvings on them, and it is mentioned in-game as being a place where\nrituals take place. It can be seen in random encounters that giants will mourn\nthe death of mammoths, which is indicative of complex cosmological beliefs\nheld by giants concerning their mammoths (Varnson, 2021). This suggests that\ngiants saw mammoths as more than just livestock but held them in high regard.\nArchaeological studies of animal burials have found them to be part of\nmourning as well as ritualistic purposes (Morris, 2016).\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nThis article has covered the wide range of burial practices shown in the games\nMorrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim. We have analysed them anthropologically and\narchaeologically and found various real-world comparisons with surprising\nresults, such as the dragon cult burials resembling those of the Ancient\nEgyptians rather than those of the Norse, on which their culture is based. For\nthe most part, the other burial types analysed resemble the real-world\ncultural parallels they were intended to, albeit with a fantastical twist. The\npractice of necromancy likewise bears little resemblance to the real-world\npractice of communicating with the deceased, instead focusing on the raising\nof undead minions and the search for immortality. This article has not\ndiscussed the MMORPG The Elder Scrolls Online (2014), however, which would\nprovide a whole new dataset of burial practices. If one were to look at other\ngames too, an entire volume could be written on burial practices in fantasy\nvideo games, as the interactive nature of the role-playing genre naturally\nlends itself to anthropological analysis.\n\n## REFERENCES\n\nAggaili, A.
