Nevertheless, there are other reasons why a pilot may\nwant to leave the flight deck mid-flight, the most common of which is for a\nbathroom break.\n\nRegulations relating to cockpit door safety have significantly changed after\nsignificant events like the 2001 terrorist attacks of9/11and the 2015\nintentional crash of a Germanwings Airbus A320 into the French Alps. Let's\ntake a look at how the current regulations deal with the issue of pilots\nleaving the cockpit during flight.\n\n## Leaving the cockpit\n\nPilots are generally free to leave thecockpitduring the cruise phase of\nflight. This can be to make a trip to the restroom, check on certain things in\nthe passenger cabins, or simply stretch their legs. On longer flights, pilots\nare also allowed to take periods of \"controlled rest,\" usually a 40-minute nap\ntimed to prevent pilots from entering a deeper stage of sleep.\n\nPhoto: Sumit Singh | Simple Flying\n\nHowever, regulations state that only one pilot can leave the flight deck at a\ntime, and crucially, only if there is another crew member present. That means\nthat for a flight crew that only consists of a captain and a first officer,\nany one of the pilots who wants to leave the cockpit will have to call in a\nflight attendant. The need for a flight attendant is eliminated if a relief\npilot is already present on the flight deck. Simply put, there must be at\nleast two people in the cockpit at all times when the aircraft is airborne.\n\nRelated\n\n##### How The Advent Of Glass Cockpits Reduced The Need For Flight Engineers\n\nTechnological advances in the cockpit enable modern aircraft to fly with only\ntwo pilots.\n\nIndeed, when flying below 10,000 ft, the sterile cockpit rule applies,\nprohibiting all unnecessary conversation and activities. This includes leaving\nthe cockpit for reasons other than absolutely necessary. That said, a pilot\ncan still leave the flight deck to have a first-hand look at certain aircraft\nareas that are only visible from the passenger cabins.\n\nPhoto: Airbus\n\nOn some occasions, the pilot may need to leave the flight deck to deal with an\nonboard or technical problem. In such cases, the pilot may need to inspect\nsomething for themselves before making a decision on whether to divert the\nplane. This can include a visual inspection of the aircraft or an assessment\nof an unruly passenger.\n\n## How 9/11 changed cockpit safety\n\nThe 9/11 terrorist attacks have had a lasting impact on aviation security.\nThey proved that even commercial airplanes could be deadly weapons in the\nwrong hands. The most significant change that directly resulted from the 2001\nterrorist attacks was related to cockpit access. Before the incident,\nregulations relating to access to flight decks were pretty lenient - pilots\nwere free to bring passengers and children into the cockpit during pretty much\nany phase of flight.\n\nPhoto: easyJet\n\nHowever, following the attacks\u2014which involved terrorists storming each\ncockpit\u2014access was limited to certain authorized personnel only. Moreover,\nregulations mandated more robust and durable cockpit doors that were to be\nkept locked at all times, even when a pilot was out on a restroom break.\n\nDiscover more aviation news with Simple Flying.\n\nPhoto: Airbus\n\nThere's no doubt that flight safety from onboard threats has improved\ndramatically in the past half-century, particularly after the 9/11 attacks.\nHijackings were a much more common occurrence in previous decades, generally\npeaking around the early 1970s before authorities implemented better security\nmeasures. In fact, as perColumbia Daily Tribune, a hijacking was occurring on\naverage once every five days somewhere in the world between 1968 and 1972,\nwith over 130 such events in the US alone.\n\n## Recent incidents\n\nImpenetrable doors and no way to access the cockpit from outside indirectly\nled to the Germanwings crash in 2015, where a mentally disturbed first officer\ndeliberately flew an Airbus A320 into a mountain when the captain was out of\nthe cockpit on a bathroom break. The first officer locked the cockpit door\nfrom inside, leaving no way for the captain to force his way in. This led to\nanother rule change, mandating at least two people on the flight deck at all\ntimes.\n\nRelated\n\n##### Why Are An Aircraft's Cockpit Doors Open During Boarding?\n\nThe cockpit is a busy place before takeoff\n\nEvery now and then, an unruly passenger will try to gain access to the\ncockpit, whether due to inebriation or some kind of mental episode. This\nhappened recently on an Alaska Airlines flight when a student pilot -\ndescribed by an airline spokesperson as appearing \"confused\" - attempted\ntoopen the cockpit door on three separate occasionsbefore he was restrained by\noff-duty police.\n\n## Singe-pilot operations\n\nSome in the industry are pushing for the acceptance of single-pilot operations\nbut have faced opposition from those pointing out the safety risks. The most\nlikely safety risk would be pilot incapacitation due to some kind of medical\nevent\u2014while modern aircraft are becoming increasingly automated, not all\npassengers would feel particularly safe with only a single pilot in the\ncockpit, either.\n\nRelated\n\n##### EASA Rules Out Single Pilot Flights By 2030 But Slightly Opens The Door\n\nThe issue of solo-pilot operation has bubbled back up to the surface, although\nEASA has positively ruled it out before 2030.\n\nCan you remember visiting the cockpit of a commercial flight when you were\nyounger?
