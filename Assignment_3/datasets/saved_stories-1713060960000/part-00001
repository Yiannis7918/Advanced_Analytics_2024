Saar\u2019s COV-2\n\nSaar Wilf is an ex-Israeli entrepreneur. Since 2016, he\u2019s been developing a\nnew form of reasoning, meant to transcend normal human bias.\n\nHis method - called Rootclaim - uses Bayesian reasoning, a branch of math that\nexplains the right way to weigh evidence. This isn\u2019t exactly new. Everyone\nsupports Bayesian reasoning. The statisticians support it, I support it, Nate\nSilver wrote a whole book supporting it.\n\nBut the joke goes that you do Bayesian reasoning by doing normal reasoning\nwhile muttering \u201cBayes, Bayes, Bayes\u201d under your breath. Nobody - not the\nstatisticians, not Nate Silver, certainly not me - tries to do full Bayesian\nreasoning on fuzzy real-world problems. They\u2019d be too hard to model. You\u2019d\nmake some philosophical mistake converting the situation into numbers, then\nend up much worse off than if you\u2019d tried normal human intuition.\n\nRootclaim spent years working on this problem, until he was satisfied his\nmethod could avoid these kinds of pitfalls. Then they started posting analyses\nof different open problems to their site, rootclaim.com. Here are three:\n\nFor example, does Putin have cancer? We start with the prior for Russian men\nages 60-69 having cancer (14.32%, according to health data). We adjust for\nPutin\u2019s healthy lifestyle (-30% cancer risk) and lack of family history (-5%).\nPutin hasn\u2019t vanished from the world stage for long periods of time, which\nseems about 4x more likely to be true if he didn\u2019t have cancer than if he did.\nAbout half of cancer patients lose their hair, and Putin hasn\u2019t, so we\u2019ll\ndivide by two. On the other hand, Putin\u2019s face has gotten more swollen\nrecently, which happens about six times more often to cancer patients than to\nothers, so we\u2019ll multiply by six. And so on and so forth, until we end up with\nthe final calculation: 86% chance Putin doesn\u2019t have cancer, too bad.\n\nThis is an unusual way to do things, but Saar claimed some early victories.\nFor example, in a celebrity Israeli murder case, Saar used Rootclaim to\ndetermine that the main suspect was likely innocent, and a local mental\npatient had committed the crime; later, new DNA evidence seemed to back him\nup.\n\nOne other important fact about Saar: he is very rich. In 2008, he sold his\nfraud detection startup to PayPal for $169 million. Since then he\u2019s founded\nmore companies, made more good investments, and won hundreds of thousands of\ndollars in professional poker.\n\nSo, in the grand tradition of very rich people who think they have invented\nnew forms of reasoning everywhere, Saar issued a monetary challenge. If you\ndisagree with any of his Rootclaim analyses - you think Putin does have\ncancer, or whatever - he and the Rootclaim team will bet you $100,000 that\nthey\u2019re right. If the answer will come out eventually (eg wait to see when\nPutin dies), you can wait and see. Otherwise, he\u2019ll accept all comers in video\ndebates in front of a mutually-agreeable panel of judges.\n\nSince then, Saar and his $100,000 offer have been a fixture of Internet\ndebates everywhere. When I argued that Vitamin D didn\u2019t help fight COVID (Saar\nthinks it does), people urged me to bet against Saar, and we had a good\ndiscussion before finally failing to agree on terms. When anti-vaccine\nmultimillionaire Steve Kirsch made a similar offer, Saar took him up on it,\nalthough they\u2019ve been bogged down in judge selection for the past year.\n\nRootclaim also found in favor of the lab leak hypothesis of COVID. When Saar\ntalked about this on an old ACX comment thread, fellow commenter tgof137\n(Peter Miller) agreed to take him up on his $100K bet.\n\nAt the time, I had no idea who Peter was. I kind of still don\u2019t. He\u2019s not\nInternet famous. He describes himself as a \u201cphysics student, programmer, and\nmountaineer\u201d who \u201cobsessively researches random topics\u201d. After a family member\ngot into lab leak a few years ago, he started investigating. Although he\nstarted somewhere between neutral and positive towards the hypothesis, he\nended up \u201c90%+\u201d convinced it was false. He also ended up annoyed: contrarian\nbloggers were raking in Substack cash by promoting lab leak, but there seemed\nto be no incentive to defend zoonosis.\n\nUnlike Saar, Peter was not especially rich. $100K represented a big fraction\nof his net worth. But (he wrote me an email):\n\n> It was a moderately large financial risk for me ... I [expected] a smart and\n> unbiased person would vote for zoonosis with, say, 80% odds after seeing all\n> the evidence. If both judges voting for lab origin is uncorrelated, that's\n> 20% squared, and it was pretty low odds of a catastrophic financial risk for\n> me.\n>\n> I wasn't highly worried about losing the debate because I was wrong about\n> the science. I put in enough effort to know I'm probably correct there. My\n> biggest fear was that I'd choke at the debate for some reason, that I'd be\n> too anxious and particularly that I'd be unable to sleep the night\n> beforehand. I have zero prior debate experience to rely upon.\n\nIf this seems like a weirdly blase attitude towards risk, Peter told blogger\nPhilipp Markolin that he \u201cis a mountain climber where sometimes there is a 5%\nchance to die, and the stakes are just not that high for a debate.\u201d\n\nUnlike the eternally bogged-down Saar-Kirsch debate, here things moved\nquickly. The two contestants put out a call for judges on the ACX subreddit,\nand agreed on:\n\n  * Will van Treuren, a pharmaceutical entrepreneur with a PhD from Stanford and a background in bacteriology and immunology.\n\n  * Eric Stansifer, an applied mathematician with a PhD from MIT and experience in mathematical virology.\n\n...both of whom received $5,000 as payment for their ~1001 hours of work, paid\nby the two contestants along with their $100,000 table stakes2.\n\nThe format would be three sessions, each consisting of hour-and-a-half\narguments by both sides, then three hours for the debaters to answer questions\nfrom the judges and each other.\n\n#\n\nII. The Debate\n\nBelow, I\u2019ve included the videos from each session, plus my (long) summary if\nyou prefer text. In the second session (on viral genetics) biotech\nentrepreneur and lab leak expert Yuri Deigin stood in for Saar; Peter\ncontinued to represent himself.\n\n###\n\nSession 1: Epidemiology\n\nPeter: The first officially confirmed COVID case was a vendor at the Wuhan wet\nmarket. So were the next four, and half of the next 40. A heat map of early\ncases is obviously centered on the wet market, not on the lab. The wet market\nand the lab are about 6 miles away as the crow flies, or a 15 mile / half hour\ndrive.\n\nLocation of COVID cases in December 2020. Source: NYT, slightly edited.\n\nA map of cases at the wet market itself shows a clear pattern in favor of the\nvery southwest corner:\n\nThe southwest corner is where most of the wildlife was being sold. Rumor said\nthat included a stall with raccoon-dogs, an animal which is generally teeming\nwith weird coronaviruses, and is a plausible intermediate host between humans\nand bats:\n\nAwwww, come on, you can\u2019t stay mad at this little guy.\n\nChina said this rumor was false and refused to release any information.\nScientists were finally able to confirm the existence of the raccoon-dog shop\nin the funniest possible way: a virologist had visited Wuhan in 2014, saw the\nawful conditions in the shop, and took a picture as an example of the kind of\nplace that a future pandemic might start.\n\nSource: NPR. To be fair, we have only the scientist\u2019s word that this is why he\nhad the picture. But he definitely did have it.\n\nPeople say it would be a surprising coincidence if a zoonotic coronavirus\npandemic just so happened to start in a city with a big coronavirus research\nlab, and this is true. But it would be an even more surprising coincidence if\na lab-leak coronavirus pandemic just so happened to first get detected at a\nraccoon-dog stall in a wet market!\n\nSaar: It\u2019s not clear that the first case was at the wet market; a certain Mr.\nChen, with no connection to the market, seems to have fallen sick on December\n8. An SCMP article suggested there were 92 previously-undetected cases\nsuspicious for COVID as far back as November. And even if half of the first\nforty universally-agreed-upon cases had market connections that means another\nhalf didn\u2019t.\n\nThere was a bias towards detecting cases at the market: because authorities\nthought the market was the origin, and because everyone was thinking about\nzoonosis after SARS1, they only screened/diagnosed people with a market\nconnection. One of the few non-market-connected COVID cases detected during\nthis period was only detected because he was the relative of a hospital\nworker; the worker noticed the signs and insisted they go to the hospital\ndespite the lack of a wet market connection.\n\nAlthough the map of positive samples and cases at the market was centered near\nthe raccoon-dog stall, that could be because that area was sampled more; it\u2019s\nalso close to the mahjong room, where visitors and vendors at the market would\ngo and unwind in a tight, poorly ventilated area.\n\nThe next session will focus more on the WIV, but the short version is that\nthey were doing lots of gain of function research. So one story compatible\nwith the evidence is that a worker at WIV got infected with their modified\ncoronavirus and passed it to his contacts. COVID started spreading quietly a\nfew weeks to months before the first market-related case was detected. This\naccounts for the 92 earlier cases, Mr. Chen\u2019s case, and the half of\nofficially-detected cases with no wet market association. Then an infected\nperson went to the market, causing a super-spreader event. Some of the\ninfected market patrons went to the hospital, where doctors traced it back to\nthe market and told other doctors to be on the lookout for wet market patrons\ncoming in with weird viral pneumonias. They found some, declared victory, and\nthe few anomalies - like the hospital worker\u2019s relative - were forgotten, or\nassumed to have wet market connections that nobody could find. China quashed\nall evidence of the lab research (as was done in previous lab leak cases, eg\nthe USSR) so all we have is the apparent wet market links that Peter found so\nconvincing.\n\nPeter: The supposed pre-wet-market cases are confirmed fakes.\n\nYes, the WHO did an investigation of whether there might have been COVID cases\ncirculating before the wet market, and identified 92 unusual pneumonias that\nmerited further review. But their final investigation, which included testing\nsamples from these people after good tests became available, found that none\nof these people really had COVID.\n\nAs for Mr. Chen, he said in an interview that he was hospitalized for dental\nissues on December 8, caught COVID in the hospital on December 16, and then\nwas erroneously reported as \u201chospitalized for COVID on December 8\u201d. The\nDecember 16 date is after the first wet market cases.\n\nFurther, it seems epidemiologically impossible for COVID to have been\ncirculating much before the first cases were officially detected December 11.\nThe COVID pandemic doubles every 3.5 days. So if the first infection was much\nearlier - let\u2019s say November 11 - we would expect 256x as much COVID as we\nactually saw. Even if the first couple of cases were missed because nobody was\nlooking for them, the number of hospitalizations, deaths, etc, in January or\nwhenever were all consistent with the number of people you\u2019d expect if the\npandemic started in early December - and not consistent with 256x that many\npeople.\n\nSo probably we should just accept that the first reported case - a wet market\nvendor, December 11 - was very early in the pandemic. She wasn\u2019t literally the\nfirst case - that would most likely have been someone who worked at the\nraccoon-dog shop, whose case might (like 95% of COVID cases) have been mild\nenough not to come to medical attention. But she was certainly very early.\n\nAlthough authorities eventually decided COVID spread through a wet market and\nstarted deliberately looking for wet market connections, this only happened on\nDecember 30. So the earliest cases - including the 40 very earliest cases\nwhere half came from the wet market - weren\u2019t biased (at least not through\nthat particular route). So the claim that \u201cthe first case, and half of the\nfirst 40 cases, had wet market connections\u201d stands as real and convincing\nevidence.\n\nAlthough the exact center of the map of positive COVID samples in the wet\nmarket was the mahjong room, the samples taken from the mahjong room were not,\nthemselves, positive (cf: although a low-resolution population density map of\nNew York might show Central Park in the exact center of the population density\ngradient, Central Park does not itself have population).\n\nThere was no real \u201csuper-spreader event\u201d at the wet market. There was a slow\nburn - one case the first day, a few more the next day, a few more the day\nafter that. It\u2019s hard to see how a single visit from an infected lab worker\ncould do that.\n\nSo the only way it could possibly be a lab leak is if the lab leaked sometime\nin late November, infected exactly one lab worker, that worker went straight\nto the wet market, infected a vendor, then went home, quarantined, recovered,\nand all other cases were downstream of that first infected wet market vendor.\nThis is unparsimonious.\n\nSaar: The only source saying that Mr. Chen got sick early was an anonymous\ninterview. And even if he was later than the first wet market cases, nobody\nwas able to find any wet market connections. This means that whoever infected\nhim was earlier than the index case and not linked to the wet market.\n\nPeter argued that COVID couldn\u2019t have been more than a few weeks old when the\nfirst wet market cases were detected. But this was based on its known doubling\nrate. If pre-discovery COVID had a slower doubling time than known COVID, it\ncould have been around longer. And post-lockdown serology suggested numbers\nthat were larger than claimed at the time. So contra Peter\u2019s claims, the\ninfection could have been going on longer, which wouldn\u2019t require the first\nlab worker to go straight to the market. It could have been weeks.\n\nDr. Jesse Bloom\u2019s investigation of the wet market samples, considered the\nfinal and most conclusive, failed to find a clear connection between COVID and\nraccoon-dogs or any other animals. Although the concentration of positive\nsamples seemed highest near the raccoon dog stall, if you do a formal\nstatistical analysis of which animals\u2019 DNA was found near COVID samples most\noften, raccoon dogs are near the bottom. The top is wide-mouth bass, which\ncan\u2019t get COVID. This is obviously contamination, probably from infected\nhumans touching wide-mouth bass tanks or something.\n\nAlthough the Chinese data included a negative sample from a mahjong table, it\nincluded a mention of poultry being sold nearby, which might mean this wasn\u2019t\nthe mahjong room itself, but some other mahjong table at a poultry shop\nelsewhere in the market, and (dry) mahjong tables might not hold the virus\nwell anyway.\n\nPeter: Raccoon-dogs were sold in various cages at various stalls, separated by\nair gaps big enough to present a challenge for COVID transmission, and there\u2019s\nno reason to think that one raccoon-dog would automatically pass it to all the\nothers. The statistical analysis just proves there were many raccoon-dogs who\ndidn\u2019t have COVID. But you only need one. The raccoon dog shop and the drain\nleading out of the raccoon dog shop had some of the highest positive sample\nrates, which is more interesting than a statistical analysis which everyone\nagrees must be wrong (since it favors bass).\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why the negative mahjong sample says something about poultry, but\nbased on the stated location, it\u2019s definitely the one in the mahjong room.\n\n###\n\nSession 1.5: Lineages\n\nThis was technically part of Session 2, but formed enough of a discrete topic\nthat I found it confusing to intermix it with all the other viral genetics\npoints. I\u2019m spinning it out into a separate summary, but the videos are all in\nthe next session.\n\nYuri: The coronavirus eventually mutated into many different strains. But the\nfirst big split, seen in some of the earliest samples, is between two\ndifferent sub-strains called Lineage A and Lineage B, which differ by two\nmutations. In these two mutations, Lineage A is the same as BANAL-52, a bat\nvirus which is the closest-known relative of COVID, but Lineage B is\ndifferent. Since COVID probably evolved from something like BANAL-52, Lineage\nA must have come first, spread for a while, and then gotten two new mutations,\nturning it into Lineage B.\n\nAll of the cases at the wet market, including the first detected case, were\nLineage B. Lineage A wasn\u2019t discovered until about a week later, and none of\nthe Lineage A patients had been to the wet market.\n\nLineage A (left) was used by the Minoan Cretans, but has never been\ndeciphered. Lineage B (right) was used by the Mycaeneans for lists of palace\ngoods.\n\nThis matches Saar\u2019s story above. The lab leaked to somewhere else in Wuhan,\nnot the wet market. The virus spread undetected in the population for a while.\nDuring this time, it mutated to Lineage B. Then one of the people with Lineage\nB went to the wet market and started a superspreader event. The authorities\nsampled the patients, found Lineage B, then started looking elsewhere. Later\nthey detected some of the earlier Lineage A cases.\n\nThe market is unlikely to be the origin of the pandemic, because the original\nLineage A strain wasn\u2019t found there.\n\nPeter: Although Lineage A is evolutionarily older, Lineage B started spreading\nin humans first.\n\nWe know this because Lineage B is more common. Throughout the early pandemic,\nuntil the D614G variant drove all other strains extinct, a consistent 2/3 of\nthe cases were B, compared to 1/3 A. Both strains spread at the same rate, so\nthe best explanation is that B started earlier than A. Since COVID doubles\nevery 3-4 days, probably Lineage B started 3-4 days earlier than Lineage A,\nwhich explains why it\u2019s always been twice as many cases.\n\nBut also, Lineage B also has more internal genetic diversity than Lineage A.\nIn general, older viruses have more genetic diversity (the \u201cmolecular clock\u201d).\nThis is further evidence that B started spreading first. Pekar 2022 and Pipes\n2021 do analyses with known parameters for spread rate and diversity, and find\n90%+ odds that Lineage B was the first one in humans.\n\nWhy did the older strain start spreading later? Probably the virus crossed\nfrom bats into raccoon-dogs on some raccoon-dog farm out in the country. It\nspread in the raccoon-dogs for a while, racking up mutations, including the\n(less mutated) Lineage A strain and the (slightly more mutated) Lineage B\nstrain. Then several raccoon-dogs were taken to Wuhan for sale, including one\nwith Lineage A and another with Lineage B. The one with Lineage B passed its\nvirus to humans earlier. Then 3-4 days later, the Lineage A one passed its\nvirus to humans.\n\nLineage A was first found in a Wuhan neighborhood right next to the wet market\n(closer to the wet market than 97% of Wuhan\u2019s population). Again, it would be\na bizarre coincidence if a lab leak pandemic was first detected at a wet\nmarket. But it would be an even more bizarre coincidence if a lab leak\npandemic separated into two strains, and both were first detected at a wet\nmarket!\n\nAlthough no known wet market cases were Lineage A, a positive Lineage A\nenvironmental sample was found at the wet market, and everyone agrees most\ncases went undetected. So maybe the Lineage B raccoon-dog spread its virus to\na vendor, and that sub-strain mostly stayed in the market. But the Lineage A\nraccoon-dog spread its virus to a customer, who went back to his house nearby,\nand that strain spread in the neighborhoods next to the market.\n\nThis is the only story that explains the evolutionary precedence of A, the\ngreater spread and older molecular clock of B, and the fact that both strains\nwere first found very close to the wet market.\n\nYuri/Saar: Lineage B could be more common and diverse because it got the\nadvantage of a super-spreader event in the wet market.\n\nThere are a few scattered cases of intermediates between A and B, and a few\nother scattered cases of lineages that seem even more ancestral (ie closer to\nthe bat virus) than either. This doesn\u2019t make sense in a double spillover\nhypothesis. But it does make sense if the lineages separated in human\ntransmission somewhere between the lab and the first super-spreader event at\nthe wet market.\n\nPeter: Again, the wet market wasn\u2019t a super-spreader event. COVID spread in\nthe wet market at exactly its normal spread rate, doubling about once every\n3.5 days. Stop calling the wet market a super-spreader event.\n\nThe scattered cases of \u201cintermediates\u201d are sequencing errors. They were all\nfound by the same computer software, which \u201cautofills\u201d unsequenced bases in a\ngenome to the most plausible guess. Because Lineage B was already in the\nsoftware, depending on which part of a Lineage A virus you sequenced, you\nmight get one half or the other autofilled as Lineage B, which looked like an\n\u201cintermediate\u201d. We know this because all the supposed \u201cintermediates\u201d were\npartial cases sequenced by this particular software. We can confirm this by\nnoting that there are too many intermediates! That is, where Lineage A is\n(T/C) and Lineage B is (C/T), the software found both (T/T) \u201cintermediates\u201d\nand (C/C) \u201cintermediates\u201d. But obviously there can only be one real\nintermediate form, and we have to dismiss one or the other. But in fact we can\ndismiss both, because they were both caused by the same software bug.\n\nThe scattered \u201cprogenitor\u201d cases - those closer to the ancestral bat virus\nthan either A or B - are reversions, ie cases where a new mutation in the\nvirus happened to hit an already-mutated base and shift it back towards the\nancestral virus. We know this because all of these \u201cprogenitors\u201d were\nscattered cases found months after the pandemic started, often in entirely\ndifferent countries from Wuhan. If these were real progenitor viruses, they\nwould have either fizzled out or exploded into a substantial portion of all\ncases, not be found one time in one guy in Malaysia. Given the number of\nmutations the virus developed over the course of the pandemic, it\u2019s inevitable\nthat some of them would be mutations that bring it closer to the original bat\nvirus, and in fact we find the number of \u201cprogenitors\u201d found very nicely\nmatches the number of progenitor-appearing viruses we would expect by chance.\nAnd in many cases, we know the \u201cprogenitors\u201d are newer than the original\nlineages, because they also have some of the later mutations that Lineage A or\nB picked up along the way, alongside their apparent ancestral-bat-virus-like\nmutations.\n\n###\n\nSession 2: Viral Genetics\n\nYuri: Two years before COVID, scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology,\ntogether with colleagues at the University of North Carolina, sent in a grant\nproposal for the DEFUSE program. This program, intended to locate and better\nunderstand potential future pandemic viruses, involved going into bat caves\nand collecting new coronaviruses. Once they had them, they would do gain-of-\nfunction: specifically, they would add a furin cleavage site to make them more\ninfectious and see what happened.\n\n(quick interlude: COVID\u2019s spike protein has two sections: one binds to human\ncells through the ACE2 receptor, the other helps fuse with the cell after\nbinding. In order to avoid the immune system, it hides both of these into one\nspike. But when it reaches a cell, it needs to separate them again. It takes\nadvantage of a human respiratory enzyme, furin, to do the separation - this\nalso ensures that it only infects its primary target, human respiratory cells.\nThe part of COVID that lets it get separated by furin is called the \u201cfurin\ncleavage site\u201d. COVID\u2019s bat-virus ancestors were gastrointestinal viruses; the\naddition of a furin cleavage site was what made them respiratory viruses.)\n\nWe\u2019ve found two close relatives of COVID: bat viruses called RATG-13 and\nBANAL-52. In particular, COVID looks more or less like BANAL-52 plus a furin\ncleavage site.\n\nThere are 1500 sarbecoviruses, members of the family of viruses that includes\nSARS and SARS2/COVID. None of them except COVID have furin cleavage sites.\nBANAL-52, COVID\u2019s closest ancestor, doesn\u2019t even have anything resembling one\nthat could mutate into a functional furin cleavage site like COVID\u2019s.\n\nInstead, COVID - which mostly just resembles BANAL-52 with a few scattered\nsingle-point mutations - has twelve completely new nucleotides in a row - a\nfully formed furin cleavage site that came out of nowhere. There is nowhere\nelse in the genome that COVID differs from BANAL-52 in such a profound way.\nIt\u2019s just BANAL-52 plus a little bit of random mutation plus a fully-formed\nfurin cleavage site that came out of nowhere.\n\nFurther, the furin cleavage site is weird. It uses the protein arginine twice.\nBut instead of the nucleotides coding for arginine in the usual viral way,\nboth times it uses the codons CGG - the way that higher animals code for\narginine. This works fine - it\u2019s just not how viruses do it.\n\nSo the obvious conclusion is that WIV, which said in 2018 that it was going to\nfind viruses and add furin cleavage sites to them, found a close relative of\nBANAL-52 and added a furin cleavage site. Since they were humans, and most\nfamiliar with the human way of encoding arginine, they added it as CGG both\ntimes.\n\nCOVID seemed surprisingly optimized for infecting humans. Of fifty animals it\nwas tested in, including the usual coronavirus intermediate hosts (pangolins,\nraccoon-dogs, etc), it was best at infecting human cells. Further, a virus\nthat enters a new species will usually show a burst of mutations as it\n\u201cfigures out\u201d the best way to adapt to that species\u2019 unique biology. But COVID\nhas had a pretty constant mutation rate in humans, from the beginning of the\npandemic to the end. That suggests it was already adapted to humans. This\ncould be because the lab screened for viruses with existing adaptations,\nbecause they passed it through humanized mice in the lab, or because it\nadapted in the hundreds of undetected cases that happened between the lab and\ndetection in the wet market.\n\nUsually, research with potentially dangerous coronaviruses is done in BSL-3 or\n4, ie high to very-high security. But WIV was irresponsibly doing it in BSL-2,\nie medium security. The researchers weren\u2019t even required to wear masks. In\ngeneral, about 1/500 labs will leak any given pathogen they\u2019re working on\n(?!). But because WIV was researching such an infectious virus in such an\nirresponsible way, the odds of a leak were much higher.\n\nThe most likely explanation for all these facts is that WIV went ahead and did\nthe gain-of-function research they said they were going to do (the particular\nDEFUSE grant proposal we know about got rejected, but it proves that Wuhan\nwanted to do this, and they could easily have gotten funding somewhere else,\nor done it out of their regular budget). They found a close relative of\nBANAL-52 and added a furin cleavage site as a simple twelve-nucleotide\ninsertion, using the human method of encoding arginine that their genetic\nengineers were familiar with. Then it leaked, spread for a while in the\ngeneral Wuhan population, and eventually made it to the wet market where it\ngot detected.\n\nPeter: As mentioned earlier, the DEFUSE grant was rejected. Further, the grant\nsaid that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was responsible for finding the\nviruses, and the University of North Carolina would do all the gain-of-\nfunction research. This was a reasonable division of labor, since UNC was\nactually good at gain-of-function research, and WIV mostly wasn\u2019t. They had\ndone a few very simple gain-of-function projects before, but weren\u2019t really\nset up for this particular proposal and were happy to leave it for their\nAmerican colleagues.\n\nEven if WIV did try to create COVID, they couldn\u2019t have. As Yuri said, COVID\nlooks like BANAL-52 plus a furin cleavage site. But WIV didn\u2019t have BANAL-52.\nIt wasn\u2019t discovered until after the COVID pandemic started, when scientists\nscoured the area for potential COVID relatives. WIV had a more distant COVID\nrelative, RATG-13. But you can\u2019t create COVID from RATG-13; they\u2019re too\ndifferent. You would need BANAL-52, or some as-yet-undiscovered extremely\nclose relative. WIV had neither.\n\nAre we sure they had neither? Yes. Remember, WIV\u2019s whole job was looking for\nnew coronaviruses. They published lists of which ones they had found pretty\nregularly. They published their last list in mid-2019, just a few months\nbefore the pandemic. Although lab leak proponents claimed these lists showed\nweird discrepancies, this was just their inability to keep names consistent,\nand all the lists showed basically the same viruses (plus a few extra on the\nlater ones, as they kept discovering more). The lists didn\u2019t include BANAL-52\nor any other suitable COVID relatives - only RATG-13, which isn\u2019t close enough\nto work.\n\nCould they have been keeping their discovery of BANAL-52 secret? No. Pre-\npandemic, there was nothing interesting about it; our understanding of\nvirology wasn\u2019t good enough to point this out as a potential pandemic\ncandidate. WIV did its gain-of-function research openly and proudly (before\nthe pandemic, gain-of-function wasn\u2019t as unpopular as it is now) so it\u2019s not\nlike they wanted to keep it secret because they might gain-of-function it\nlater. Their lists very clearly showed they had no virus they could create\nCOVID from, and they had no reason to hide it if they did.\n\nCOVID\u2019s furin cleavage site is admittedly unusual. But it\u2019s unusual in a way\nthat looks natural rather than man-made. Labs don\u2019t usually add furin cleavage\nsites through nucleotide insertions (they usually mutate what\u2019s already\nthere). On the other hand, viruses get weird insertions of 12+ nucleotides in\nnature. For example, HKU1 is another emergent Chinese coronavirus that caused\na small outbreak of pneumonia in 2004. It had a 15 nucleotide insertion right\nnext to its furin cleavage site. Later strains of COVID got further 12 - 15\nnucleotide insertions. Plenty of flus have 12 to 15 nucleotide insertions\ncompared to other earlier flu strains.\n\nSometimes insertions happen because of a mistake in viral replication. Other\ntimes the virus gets confused between its own RNA and its host\u2019s, and splices\na bit of the host RNA into the virus. This would neatly explain why the\ninsertion used the unusual coding CGG for arginine, which is common in animals\nbut rare in viruses. On the other hand, it\u2019s not that rare in viruses - COVID\nuses CGG for arginine about 3% of the time. And human engineers don\u2019t\nnecessarily use it any more than that - Peter was able to find one example of\nhumans adding arginine to a virus, and 0 out of the 5 arginines added were\nCGG.\n\nCOVID\u2019s furin cleavage site is a mess. When humans are inserting furin\ncleavage sites into viruses for gain-of-function, the standard practice is\nRRKR, a very nice and simple furin cleavage site which works well. COVID uses\nPRRAR, a bizarre furin cleavage site which no human has ever used before, and\nwhich virologists expected to work poorly. They later found that an adjacent\npart of COVID\u2019s genome twisted the protein in an unusual way that allowed\nPRRAR to be a viable furin cleavage site, but this discovery took a lot of\ncomputer power, and was only made after COVID became important. The Wuhan\nvirologists supposedly doing gain-of-function research on COVID shouldn\u2019t have\nknown this would work. Why didn\u2019t they just use the standard RRKR site, which\nwould have worked better? Everyone thinks it works better! Even the virus\neventually decided it worked better - sometime during the course of the\npandemic, it mutated away from its weird PRRAR furin cleavage site towards a\nmore normal form.\n\nFurther, COVID\u2019s furin cleavage site was inserted via what seems to be a\nframeshift mutation - it wasn\u2019t a clean insertion of the amino acids that\nformed the site, it was an insertion of a sequence which changed the context\nof the surrounding nucleotides into the amino acids that formed the site. This\nis a pointless too-clever-by-half \u201cflourish\u201d that there would be no reason for\na human engineer to do. But it\u2019s exactly the kind of weird thing that happens\nin the random chance of evolution.\n\nCOVID is hard to culture. If you culture it in most standard media or animals,\nit will quickly develop characteristic mutations. But the original Wuhan\nstrains didn\u2019t have these mutations. The only ways to culture it without\nmutations are in human airway cells, or (apparently) in live raccoon-dogs.\nGetting human airway cells requires a donor (ie someone who donates their body\nto science), and Wuhan had never done this before (it was one of the\ntechnologies only used at the superior North Carolina site). As for raccoon-\ndogs, it sure does seems suspicious that the virus is already suited to them.\n\nThe claim that COVID is uniquely adapted to humans is false. The paper that\nclaimed that defined how well COVID was adapted to different animals by those\nanimals\u2019 difference (on the relevant cell receptors) from humans. So in its\nmethodology, humans came out #1 by default. If you don\u2019t do that, COVID is\nbetter-adapted to many other animals.\n\nIt\u2019s not necessarily true that viruses see a burst of mutations when they\nenter a new host. COVID spread to deer and mink, and in neither case was there\na burst of mutations. COVID has a pretty simple job of infecting respiratory\ncells and is already very good at it, regardless of species.\n\nIn Yuri\u2019s model, Wuhan Institute of Virology picked up a discarded grant and\ndecided to do the gain-of-function half allotted to a different university,\ndespite their relative inexperience. They skipped over all the SARS-like\nviruses they were supposed to work on, and all the standard gain-of-function\nmodel backbones, in favor of BANAL-52, a virus which would not be discovered\nfor another two years, but which they somehow had samples of, which they had\nfor some reason decided to keep secret despite its total lack of\ninterestingness. Then they would have had to eschew all usual gain-of-function\npractices in favor of inserting a weird furin cleavage site that shouldn\u2019t\nhave worked according to the theory they had at the time, via a frameshift\nmutation. Then they would have had to culture it, a technique beyond their\nlimited capabilities. Then it would have had to leak, and magically show up\nagain in front of the raccoon-dog stall at a wet market.\n\nYuri: WIV wouldn\u2019t have needed to keep BANAL-52 \u201csecret\u201d in some kind of\nsinister way. Plenty of researchers have backlogs of work they haven\u2019t\npublished yet. Probably they a found BANAL relative in one of their normal\nsampling trips, did some preliminary studies on it, and planned to publish it\nlater once they cleaned up their data. Everyone works like this.\n\nThe part of DEFUSE saying that they would only work on viruses that were 95%\nsimilar to SARS is unclear and might mean something else. It looks more like\nthey say they\u2019ll start with those viruses, but also do some work on novel\nviruses. BANAL-52 could have been one of the novel viruses.\n\nThe furin cleavage site is weird, but the researchers might have done that on\npurpose, to make the virus easier to keep track of, or to test different furin\ncleavage sites. Depending on the exact BANAL-52 relative they used, it might\nnot even be a frameshift; there\u2019s a particular way to spell serine that would\nmake the insertion more natural.\n\nThe claims that COVID can\u2019t be cultured in normal media are based on\nspeculative original research by Peter and might not hold up.\n\nPeter: WIV did most of its virus-gathering in a trip to a Yunnan cave between\n2010 and 2015. All those viruses have long since been processed and added to\nthe database. There\u2019s no sign that they made more trips to Yunnan caves, and\nno reason for them to keep that secret. So the idea that they might just have\nsome new viruses they didn\u2019t publish doesn\u2019t hold up.\n\nBut suppose they did make more trips. Given the amount of time between the\nDEFUSE proposal and COVID, if they kept to their normal virus-collection rate,\nthey would have gotten about thirty new viruses. What\u2019s the chance that one of\nthose was BANAL-52? There are thousands of bat viruses, and BANAL-52 is so\nrare that it wasn\u2019t found until well after the pandemic started and people\nwere looking for it very hard. So the chance that one of their 30 would be\nBANAL-52 is low. Also, they said in DEFUSE that they planned to go back to the\nsame Yunnan cave. But BANAL-52 was found far away from that cave, so unless it\nranged over a wide area, they probably couldn\u2019t have found it even if they got\nvery lucky.\n\n###\n\nSession 3: Closing Arguments\n\nThis third debate was supposed to be about \u201cinference\u201d, ie how much Bayesian\nevidence was provided by each of the facts given so far, and how to fit them\ninto the Rootclaim probabilistic model. I\u2019m going to relegate my summary of\nthe more probabilistic half to the next section of this post, and just include\nthe closing arguments here.\n\nSaar: Peter\u2019s case hinges on the idea that it\u2019s very improbable that a lab\nleak pandemic would first show up at a wet market. But this isn\u2019t necessarily\nimprobable. The Huanan Seafood Market had several factors that made it a\nlikely location for a superspreader event. It was busy, with over 10,000\nvisitors a day. Many of the people there (eg the 1,000 vendors) came back\ndaily, letting them reinfect each other. It had poor ventilation, especially\nin the high-positivity area near the raccoon-dog stall. It had cold wet\nsurfaces on which the virus could survive for long periods. It was indoors,\nwhich prevented UV light from killing the virus. Given a small amount of\nsporadic COVID going around Wuhan, it\u2019s not surprising for the first place it\nstarted spreading en masse to be a wet market.\n\nIn fact, we have several examples of this. When China was COVID Zero, there\nwould occasionally be small outbreaks that the authorities would have to\ncontain. Most of these were at wet markets. For example, the big COVID\noutbreak in Beijing started at Xinfadi Market, their local seafood market.\nThis couldn\u2019t be an animal spillover, because there were no raccoon-dogs or\nother weird wildlife there. So it must be that wet markets are natural places\nfor superspreader events. There are several other examples, which make up\nabout half of the total outbreaks in Zero COVID era China, plus others in\nSingapore and Thailand. Since COVID clusters concentrate in wet markets even\nwhen there is no animal spillover, we should accept this as a property of the\nvirus, and not attribute any significance to the fact that this happened in\nWuhan too.\n\nPeter: About 1/10,000 citizens of Wuhan was a wet market vendor. So there\u2019s a\n1/10,000 chance that the first known COVID case should be a wet market vendor\nby chance alone. Weibo lists the most popular places for people to check in to\ntheir network on their phones, and the wet market was the 1600th most popular\nplace in Wuhan, meaning that if you weight locations by busy-ness, there\u2019s a\nless than 1/1600 chance that the first cases would be in the wet market.\n\nYes, the wet market is indoors, has mediocre ventilation, has repeat visitors,\netc. So do thousands of other places in Wuhan, like schools, hospitals,\nworkplaces, places of worship. The wet market isn\u2019t special in any way. And\nagain, it wasn\u2019t a superspreader event! COVID spread at the same rate in the\nwet market as it does everywhere else: doubling once per 3.5 days. It doesn\u2019t\nmatter what kinds of arguments you can come up with for why the wet market\nshould have been the perfect superspreader event location, we can look at it\nand see that it wasn\u2019t. It\u2019s an environment that spreads COVID at exactly the\nnormal rate.\n\nZero COVID era Chinese outbreaks were concentrated in wet markets because they\nreceived infected animal products. We know why there was an outbreak in the\nXinfadi Market in Beijing: it was because the seafood stall got frozen fish\nfrom some non-Zero-COVID country, the fish had COVID particles on it, and the\nvendor got infected and spread it to everyone else. Something like this is\ntrue for the other Chinese wet market based outbreaks we know about it. So\nthis makes the opposite point you think it does: wet markets start outbreaks\nbecause there are infected goods being sold there. Then the virus spreads\nthrough the wet market at a completely normal rate.\n\nSaar: The Weibo list of 1600 places bigger than the wet market is likely\ninaccurate, because it's based on check-in data and people don't check in to\nseafood markets. Most of those 1600 places aren't amenable to superspread. The\n70 markets supposedly bigger than Huanan are irrelevant, because they're\nsupermarkets, open air markets, etc. Huanan is the largest seafood market in\ncentral China, and a more likely place for the first cluster of cases to be\nnoticed.\n\nMarkets weren't a common spillover location in SARS1, so the zoonosis\nhypothesis hasn't \"called\" this event in a way that should give them a high\nBayes factor.\n\nAnd there\u2019s still plenty of evidence for isolated (though not super-spreading)\npre-market cases. A British expatriate in Wuhan, Connor Reed, says he got sick\nin November, three weeks before the first wet market case. Later the hospital\ntested his samples and said it was COVID. Another paper reports 90 cases\nbefore the first wet market one.\n\nPeter: Connor Reed was lying. The case wasn\u2019t reported in any peer-reviewed\npaper. It was reported in the tabloid The Daily Mail, months after it\nsupposedly happened. He also told the Mail that his cat died of coronavirus\ntoo, which is rare-to-impossible. Also, to get a positive hospital test, he\nwould have had to go to the hospital, but he was 25 years old and almost no\n25-year-olds go to the hospital for coronavirus. His only evidence that it was\nCOVID was that two months later, the hospital supposedly \u201cnotified\u201d him that\nit was. The hospital never informed anyone else of this extremely surprising\nfact which would be the biggest scientific story of the year if true. So\nprobably he was lying. Incidentally, he died of a drug overdose shortly after\ngiving the Mail that story; while not all drug addicts are liars, given all\nthe other implausibilities in his story, this certainly doesn\u2019t make him seem\nmore credible. And in any case, he claimed he got his case at a market \u201clike\nin the media\u201d\n\nThe other 90 cases are also fake. A lab leak guy found a paper that mentioned\n90 more cases than other papers, and made up a conspiracy theory where the\nauthor was trying to secretly communicate that there had been 90 secret cases\nbefore any of the confirmed cases, even though there was nothing about this in\nthe text of the paper. But actually that paper just counted cases differently\nthan other papers, and they were referring to normal cases after the pandemic\nofficially started.\n\nAgain, I\u2019ll come back to the discussion about inference later, but for now,\nhere\u2019s a table of both sides\u2019 reasoning. This exact presentation comparing\nboth analyses is mine3, but you can see Saar\u2019s version here, and Peter\u2019s\nstarting at 45:33 of this video.\n\nSlightly made up; the two sides didn\u2019t express their probabilities in the same\nway and I had to make editorial decisions to match them. Note that these\naren't entirely comparable because Peter is being laxer about out-of-model\nprobability than Saar. Although Saar's final odds here are 533-to-1, this just\nthe central estimate. Rootclaim\u2019s real final probability is 94% lab leak. You\ncan see their analysis here.\n\n###\n\nAnd The Winner Is . . .\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\nPeter and the zoonosis hypothesis.\n\nThis was a decisive victory. There were two judges, who each gave separate\nverdicts (or were allowed to declare a draw). Both judges decided in favor of\nPeter.\n\nYou can see the judges\u2019 own summary of their reasoning here (Will, Eric)\n\nManifold agreed with the judges. There was a prediction market on who would\nwin. It started out 70-30 in favor of lab leak. As the videos came out,\nzoonosis started doing better and better. I don\u2019t want to take the exact final\nnumbers too seriously, since I think some of the later price increases\ninvolved hints from the participants\u2019 behavior. But it\u2019s clear which way\nviewers thought the wind was blowing4.\n\nAround the same time, the Good Judgment Project - Philip Tetlock\u2019s group\nstudying superforecasters - put out a report on the lab leak hypothesis. After\nstudying it in depth, his forecasters ended up 75-25 in favor of zoonosis. The\nRootclaim debate was one of ten sources they said they found especially\ninteresting.\n\nAnd also around the same time, and unrelated to any of this, the Global\nCatastrophic Risks Institute surveyed experts (\u201c168 virologists, infectious\ndisease epidemiologists, and other scientists from 47 countries\u201d) and found\nthe same thing (though see here for some potential problems with the survey):\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I was close to 50-50 before the debate, and now I\u2019m 90-10\nin favor of zoonosis.\n\n#\n\nIII. The Math And The Aftermath\n\nThe third debate session was about \u201cinference\u201d, how to put evidence together.\nI put this part off until after disclosing the winner, because I wanted to\ntalk about some of these issues at more length.\n\n###\n\nThe Math: Judges\n\nBoth judges included a probabilistic analysis in their written decision.\nHere\u2019s the same table as above, expanded to add the judges:\n\nI shoehorned the judges\u2019 factors into the categories I already had; some of\nthem were actually subtly different from Peter\u2019s, Saar\u2019s, and each other\u2019s.\nThe \u201cpriors\u201d category is especially a mess here.\n\nWe\u2019ll go over these later, but I get the impression that they both thought of\nprobabilistic analyses as an afterthought. For example, Judge Eric wrote\n30,000 words about which considerations moved him, and only then includes the\nanalysis, saying:\n\n> I am not convinced that this Bayesian calculation is even an appropriate way\n> to estimate the relative posterior probability of Z and LL; it just seemed\n> fair that after criticizing Rootclaim\u2019s calculations at length I should make\n> an attempt at it myself.\n\nJudge Will\u2019s decision ran to 10,000 words. He said he independently tried both\nreasoning it out intuitively, and running the Bayesian analysis, and was\nrelieved when these two methods returned the same result. He said:\n\n> I am skeptical that the Bayesian decision making/evaluation methods are any\n> more \"objective\" than [intuitive reasoning]. I think they maximize\n> legibility, not objectivity, and tend to hide the intuitive/heuristic\n> portion in the data inclusion step and values, where it\u2019s harder to see . .\n> . I am not skilled in the Bayesian method, and I am sure I made significant\n> mistakes. More time and practice would improve and refine my estimates. At\n> the fundamental rules of the universe level, Bayesian analysis must be the\n> best way to evaluate evidence. However, I am unsure that it\u2019s a good\n> strategy for a human given our cognitive limitations, and doubly unsure it\u2019s\n> truly being used (in the dispassionate sense) where the outcome is social\n> desirability/fame/Twitter likes.\n\nI\u2019m focusing on this because Saar\u2019s opinion is that the debate went wrong (for\nhis side) because he didn\u2019t realize the judges were going to use Bayesian\nmath, they did the math wrong (because Saar hadn\u2019t done enough work explaining\nhow to do it right), and so they got the wrong answer. I want to discuss the\nmath errors he thinks the judges made, but this discussion would be incomplete\nwithout mentioning that the judges themselves say the numbers were only a\nsupplement for their intuitive reasoning.\n\nThat having been said, let\u2019s look deeper into some of Saar\u2019s concerns.\n\n###\n\nThe Math: Extreme Odds\n\nSaar complained that Peter\u2019s odds were too extreme. For example, Peter said\nthere was only a 1/10,000 chance that a lab leak pandemic would first show up\nat a wet market.\n\nPeter\u2019s argument went something like: obviously a zoonotic pandemic would\nstart at a site selling weird animals. But a lab leak pandemic - if it didn\u2019t\nstart at the lab - could show up anywhere. 1/10,000 Wuhan citizens work at the\nwet market. So if a lab leak was going to show up somewhere random, the wet\nmarket was a 1/10,000 chance.\n\nSaar had specific arguments against this, but he also had a more general\nargument: you should rarely see odds like 1/10,000 outside of well-understood\ndomains. In his blog post, he gave this example:\n\n> A prosecutor shows the court a statistical analysis of which DNA markers\n> matched the defendant and their prevalence, arriving at a 1E-9 probability\n> they would all match a random person, implying a Bayes factor near 1E9 for\n> guilty.\n>\n> But if we try to estimate p(DNA|~guilty) by truly assuming innocence, it is\n> immediately evident how ridiculous it is to claim only 1 out of a billion\n> innocent suspects will have a DNA match to the crime scene. There are\n> obviously far better explanations like a lab mistake, framing, an object of\n> the suspect being brought by someone to the scene, etc.\n\nSo the real p(wet market|lab leak) isn\u2019t the 1/10,000 chance a pandemic\narising in a random place hits the wet market, but the (higher?) probability\nthat there\u2019s something wrong with Peter\u2019s argument.\n\nThen Saar tried to show specific things that might be wrong with Peter\u2019s\nargument. I didn\u2019t find his specific examples convincing. But maybe the\nquestion shouldn\u2019t be whether I agreed with him. It should be whether I\u2019m so\nconfident he\u2019s wrong that I would give it 10,000-to-1 odds.\n\nThis makes total sense, it\u2019s absolutely true, and I want to be really, really\ncareful with it. If you take this kind of reasoning too far, you can convince\nyourself that the sun won\u2019t rise tomorrow morning. All you have to do is\npropose 100 different reasons the sunrise might not happen. For example:\n\n  1. The sun might go nova.\n\n  2. An asteroid might hit the Earth, stopping its rotation.\n\n  3. An unexpected eclipse might blot out the sun.\n\n  4. God exists and wants to stop the sunrise for some reason.\n\n  5. This is a simulation, and the simulators will prevent the sunrise as a prank.\n\n  6. Aliens will destroy the sun.\n\n...and so on until you reach 100. On the one hand, there are 100 of these\nreasons. But on the other, they\u2019re each fantastically unlikely - let\u2019s say\n99.9999999999% chance each one doesn\u2019t happen - so it doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nBut suppose you get too humble. Sure, you might think you have a great model\nof how eclipses work and you know they never happen off schedule - but can you\nreally be 99.9999999999% sure you understood your astronomy professor\ncorrectly? Can you be 99.9999999999% sure you\u2019re not insane, and that your\n\u201creasoning\u201d isn\u2019t just random seizings of neurons that aren\u2019t connecting to\nreality at any point? Seems like you can\u2019t. So maybe you should lower your\ndisbelief in each hypothesis to something more reasonable, like 99%. But now\nthe chance that the sun rises tomorrow is 0.99^100, aka 36%. Seems bad.\n\nAlso, suppose I agree I shouldn\u2019t use numbers like 1-in-10,000. What should my\nreal numbers be? Saar says it\u2019s the strength of the strongest hypothesis for\nwhy I might be wrong. But I can\u2019t think of any good reasons I might be wrong\nhere. Should I feel okay after adjusting it down to 1-in-1,000? 1-in-100?\n1-in-10?\n\nSaar said he \u201ccould have\u201d argued that there was only a one-in-a-million chance\nCOVID\u2019s furin cleavage site evolved naturally. Instead, he gave a Bayes factor\nof 1-in-20, because he wanted to leave room for out-of-model error. But (as\nSaar understands it) the judges\u2019 probabilistic analysis took Peter\u2019s\nunadjusted 1-in-10,000 wet market claim seriously and Saar\u2019s fully-adjusted\n1-in-20 furin cleavage site claim literally, compared them, found Peter\u2019s\nevidence stronger, and gave him the victory. You can see why he\u2019s upset.\n\n(again, the judges deny basing their verdict solely on the probabilistic\nmodels)\n\nAt some point you have to take your best guess about how confusing a given\nfield is and how wrong you could be - how often do labs overstate their DNA\nresults? How much do you know about how viruses get furin cleavage sites? How\nsure are you about the demographics of Wuhan? How tightly does your \u201cthere\nhave been at least a million days without aliens destroying the sun, therefore\naliens will not destroy the sun tomorrow\u201d argument hang together? - and choose\na number.\n\n###\n\nThe Math: Extreme Odds, Part II\n\nDuring the debate, Peter showed this slide:\n\nOkay, this one is just awful.\n\nIt takes the risky gambit above - giving extreme odds to something - then\ndoubles down on it by multiplying across twenty different stages to get a\nstupendously low probability of 1/5*10^25. If we believe this, it\u2019s more\nlikely that we win the lottery three times in a row than that we learn lab\nleak was true after all.\n\nEliezer Yudkowsky calls this the Multiple Stage Fallacy. Even aside from the\nfailure mode in the sunrise example above (where people are too reluctant to\ngive strong probabilities), it fails because people don\u2019t think enough about\nthe correlations between stages. For example, maybe there\u2019s only 1/10 odds\nthat the Wuhan scientists would choose the suboptimal RRAR furin cleavage\nsite. And maybe there\u2019s only 1/20 odds that they would add a proline in front\nto make it PRRAR. But are these really two separate forms of weirdness, such\nthat we can multiply them together and get 1/200? Or are scientists who do one\nweird thing with a furin cleavage site more likely to do another? Mightn\u2019t\nthey be pursuing some general strategy of testing weird furin cleavage sites?\n\n(For example, Yuri proposed that, because the scientists wanted to understand\nhow pandemic coronaviruses originate in nature, they might deliberately pick\nmore natural-looking features over more designed-looking ones, which would\nneatly explain many features seemingly inconsistent with lab leak. Is this a\nconspiracy theory? Rootclaim is able to successfully route around this\nquestion. If the probability of a feature happening in nature is X, then the\nprobability of it happening in this variant of lab leak scenario is X *\n[chance that the scientists wanted to imitate nature). This gives it a\n(deserved) complexity penalty without ruling out this (non-zero and\npotentially important) possibility.)\n\nIn any case, Peter didn\u2019t care as much about probabilistic analysis as Saar,\nhe didn\u2019t make his case hinge on this slide, and he might have been kind of\nusing it to troll Rootclaim (which definitely worked). He might not have been\nmaking any of the mistakes above. But anyone who took this slide seriously\nwould end up dramatically miscalibrated.\n\n###\n\nThe Math: Big Pictures\n\nAnother of Saar\u2019s concerns with the verdict was that Peter was an\nextraordinary debater, to the point where it could have overwhelmed the signal\nfrom the evidence.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to watch the videos and not come away impressed. Peter seems to have\na photographic memory for every detail of every study he\u2019s ever read. He has\nsome kind of 3D model in his brain of Wuhan, the wet market, and how all of\nits ventilation ducts and drains interacted with each other. Whenever someone\nchallenged one of his points, he had a ten-slide PowerPoint presentation\nalready made up to address that particular challenge, and would go over it\nwith complete fluency, like he was reciting a memorized speech. I sometimes\nget accused of overdoing things, but I can\u2019t imagine how many mutations it\nwould take to make me even a fraction as competent as Peter was.\n\nSaar\u2019s closing argument included the admission:\n\n> Peter, I think everyone can agree, has much more knowledge on [COVID]\n> origins than we do. He's invested much more time. He may be a much more\n> talented researcher. He's much more into the details. He probably knows the\n> best in the world on origins at this point.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve described your opponent that way in your closing argument, what\u2019s\nleft of your case?\n\nSaar thought a lot was left. Throughout the debate, he tried to make a point\nabout how getting the inference right was more important than winning sub-sub-\nsub-debates about individual lines of evidence. Although Peter won most\nspecific points of contention, Saar thought that if the judges could just keep\ntheir mind on the big picture, they would realize a lab leak was more likely.\n\nI\u2019m potentially sympathetic to arguments like Saar\u2019s. Imagine a debate about\nUFOs. Imaginary-Saar says \u201cUFOs can\u2019t be real, because it doesn\u2019t make sense\nfor aliens to come to Earth, circle around a few fields in Kansas, then leave\nwithout providing any other evidence of their existence.\u201d Imaginary-Peter says\n\u201cJohn Smith of Topeka saw a UFO at 4:52 PM on 6/12/2010, and everyone agrees\nhe\u2019s an honorable person who wouldn\u2019t lie, so what\u2019s your explanation of\nthat?\u201d Saar says \u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe he was drunk or something?\u201d Peter says\n\u201cHa, I\u2019ve hacked his cell phone records and geolocated him to coordinates XYZ,\nwhich is a mosque. My analysis finds that he\u2019s there on 99.5% of Islamic holy\ndays, which proves he\u2019s a very religious Muslim. And religious Muslims don\u2019t\ndrink! Your argument is invalid!\u201d On the one hand, imaginary-Peter is very\nimpressive and sure did shoot down Saar\u2019s point. On the other, imaginary-Saar\nnever really claimed to have a great explanation for this particular UFO\nsighting, and his argument doesn\u2019t depend on it. Instead of debating whether\nSmith could or couldn\u2019t have been drunk, we need to zoom out and realize that\nthe aliens explanation makes no sense.\n\nThe problem was, Saar couldn\u2019t effectively communicate what his big picture\nwas. Neither deployed some kind of amazingly elegant prior. They both used the\nsame kind of evidence. The only difference was that Peter\u2019s evidence hung\ntogether, and Saar\u2019s evidence fell apart on cross-examination.\n\nI think - not because Saar really explained it, but just reading between the\nlines - Saar thought the un-ignorable big picture evidence was the origin in a\ncity with a coronavirus gain-of-function lab, and the twelve-nucleotide\ninsertion in the furin cleavage site.\n\nTo some degree, Peter just ate the loss on those questions. No matter how you\nslice it, it really is a weird coincidence that the epidemic started so close\nto Asia\u2019s biggest coronavirus laboratory. Peter tried to deflect this - he\npointed out there were other BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories in Beijing,\nShanghai, Shenzhen, etc. But this was a rare question where he unambiguously\ncame out looking worse - the other cities\u2019 labs had much less coronavirus-\nspecific research. Wuhan really was unique (aside from the other big\ncoronavirus lab in North Carolina).\n\nPeter did better when he tried to control the damage: there are a couple\nhundred million people in the South Asian areas where people eat weird animals\nexposed to virus-infected bats, Wuhan has a population of about 12 million, so\nmaybe 1.5% of all potential zoonotic pandemics should start in Wuhan. Peter\ntried to argue that Wuhan was a local trade center, so maybe we should up that\nto 5 - 10%. 5 - 10% coincidences aren\u2019t that rare. Even 1.5% coincidences\nhappen sometimes.\n\nLikewise, the furin cleavage site really does stand on a genetic map. I didn\u2019t\nfeel like either side did much math to quantify how weird it was. Naively, I\nmight think of this as \u201c30,000 bases in COVID, only one insertion, it\u2019s in\nwhat\u2019s obviously the most interesting place - sounds like 30,000-to-one odds\nagainst\u201d. Against that, a virus with a boring insertion would never have\nbecome a pandemic, so maybe you need to multiply this by however much viral\nevolution is going on in weird caves in Laos, and then you would get the odds\nthat at least one virus would have an insertion interesting enough to go\nglobal. Neither participant calculated this in a way that satisfied me (though\nsee here for related discussion). Instead, Peter tried to undermine the furin\nargument by showing that, as surprising as the site was under a natural\norigin, it would be an even more surprising choice for human engineers. Saar\nargued it wasn\u2019t - but because of his policy of giving adjusted-for-model-\nerror odds, he only gave this a factor of 30 in his analysis. Since Peter gave\nit a higher factor of 50 in his analysis, it looked from the outside like Saar\nhad already conceded this point, and the judges were mostly happy to go with\nSaar\u2019s artificially-low estimate.\n\n###\n\nThe Math: Double Coincidences\n\nSaar brought up an interesting point halfway through the debate: you should\nrarely see high Bayes factors on both sides of an argument.\n\nThat is, suppose you accept that there\u2019s only a 1-in-10,000 chance that the\npandemic starts at a wet market under lab leak. And suppose you accept there\u2019s\nonly a 1-in-10,000 chance that COVID\u2019s furin cleavage site could evolve\nnaturally.\n\nIf lab leak is true, then you might find 1-in-10,000 evidence for lab leak.\nBut it\u2019s a freak coincidence that there was 1-in-10,000 evidence for\nzoonosis5.\n\nLikewise, if zoonosis is true, you might find 1-in-10,000 evidence for this\ntrue thing. But it\u2019s a freak coincidence that there was 1-in-10,000 evidence\nfor lab leak.\n\nEither way, you\u2019re accepting that a 1-in-10,000 freak coincidence happened.\nIsn\u2019t it more likely you\u2019ve bungled your analysis?\n\nI was following along at home, and I definitely bungled this point; I had some\nhigh Bayes factors on both sides. I adjusted some of them downward based on\nSaar\u2019s good point, but how far should we take it?\n\nHere I remember The Pyramid And The Garden: you can get very strong\ncoincidences if you have many degrees of freedom, ie buy a lot of lottery\ntickets. So for example, suppose there are fifty things about a virus. You\nshould expect at least one of those to have a one-in-fifty coincidence by pure\nchance.\n\nWhat about more than that? You might be able to get away with this by saying\nthere are an infinite number of possible conspiracy theories, and some from\nthat infinite set are brought into existence when a strong enough coincidence\nmakes them plausible. For example, it\u2019s really weird that John Adams and\nThomas Jefferson both died on the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of\nIndependence. If I wanted, I could form a conspiracy theory about a group of\nweird assassins obsessed with killing Founding Fathers on important dates, and\nthen Jefferson and Adams\u2019 deaths would be 1/10,000 evidence for that theory.\nBut this is the Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy, which Saar warned against several\ntimes.\n\nI don\u2019t know if \u201cthe virus started in Wuhan, which is where they\u2019re doing this\nresearch\u201d gets a Texas Sharpshooter penalty, or how high that penalty should\nbe. But the furin cleavage site doesn\u2019t - people were talking about lab leak\nbefore anyone noticed it.\n\n###\n\nThe Aftermath: Peter\n\nPeter seemed satisfied with the result, in an understated sort of way:\n\n> It seemed like an interesting experiment in monetizing the debunking of a\n> conspiracy theory. I think there's usually a big asymmetry where it's easy\n> to get rich spreading bullshit (like, the top anti-vaxxers during the\n> pandemic all made a million dollars a year on substack), but it's almost\n> impossible to make money on debunking it.

It does seem like there could\n> be a positive social impact from more people understanding that the lab leak\n> hypothesis is (almost certainly) false.\n\n###\n\nThe Aftermath: Saar\n\nSaar says the debate didn\u2019t change his mind. In fact, by the end of the\ndebate, Rootclaim released an updated analysis that placed an even higher\nprobability on lab leak than when they started.\n\nIn his blog post, he discussed the issues above, and said the judges had erred\nin not considering them. He respects the judges, he appreciates their efforts,\nhe just thinks they got it wrong. Although he respected their decision, he\nwanted the judges to correct what he saw as mistakes in their published\nstatements, which delayed the public verdict and which which Viewers Like You\ndid not appreciate:\n\nI ran an early draft of this post by him. There was some miscommunication\nabout the exact publication date, so he hasn\u2019t had time to write up a full\nresponse, but he has some quick thoughts (and I\u2019ll link the full response when\nhe writes it). He says:\n\n> We will provide a full response to this post soon, but the main problem with\n> it is fairly simple:\n>\n> There is general agreement that the main evidence for zoonosis is HSM\n> (Huanan Seafood Market) forming an early cluster of cases.

He\u2019s even still committed to\n$100,000 bets on Rootclaim findings, settled via debate. He\u2019d even be willing\nto re-debate Peter on lab leak! (Peter declined)\n\nHe does want to make some changes to the debate format - specifically,\nswitching from video to text, and checking in more often with the judges to\nget feedback on their thought processes.\n\nThe switch from video to text seems reasonable. Saar was clearly flummoxed by\nPeter\u2019s memory and agility, and wants a format where ability to remember/think\non your feet is less important, and where you can do lots of research before\nhaving to think up a response.\n\nThe part with the feedback seems to be Saar wanting even more of an\nopportunity to identify disagreements with the judges early, and get a chance\nto tell them beforehand about issues like the ones above.\n\nI\u2019m sympathetic to both these changes, but I don\u2019t think they would have\nchanged the outcome of this debate.\n\n###\n\nThe Aftermath: Rootclaim\n\nRootclaim is an admirable idea. Somebody called it \u201cheroic Bayesian analysis\u201d,\nand I like the moniker. Regular human reasoning doesn\u2019t seem to be doing a\ngreat job puncturing false beliefs these days, and lots of people have\nconverged on something something Bayes as a solution. But the something\nsomething remains elusive. While everyone else tries \u201cpop Bayesianism\u201d and\n\u201cBayes-inspired toolboxes\u201d, Rootclaim asks: what if you just directly apply\nBayes to the world\u2019s hardest problems? There\u2019s something pure about that, in a\nway nobody else is trying.\n\nUnfortunately, the reason nobody else is trying this is because it doesn\u2019t\nwork. There\u2019s too much evidence, and it\u2019s too hard to figure out how to\nquantify it.\n\nPeter, Saar, and the two judges all did their own Bayesian analysis. I\nfollowed along at home7 and tried the same. Daniel Filan, who also watched the\ndebate, did one too. Here\u2019s a comparison of all of our results:\n\nAgain, most people didn\u2019t use these exact categories, I\u2019m putting them in this\nformat to make them easy to compare, and any errors are mine....\n\nThe six estimates span twenty-three orders of magnitude. Even if we remove\nPeter (who\u2019s kind of trolling), the remaining estimates span a range of ~7\nOOMs. And even if we remove Saar (limiting the analysis to neutral non-\nparticipants), we\u2019re still left with a factor-of-50 difference.\n\n50x sounds good compared to 23 OOMs. But it only sounds good because everyone\nexcept Saar leaned heavily towards zoonosis. If raters were closer to even, it\nwould become problematic: even a factor of 50x is enough to change 80-20 lab\nleak to 80-20 natural.\n\nSaar\u2019s perspective is that true theories should have many orders of magnitude\nmore evidence than false theories (most of the Rootclaim analyses end up with\nnormal-sounding percentages like \u201c94% sure\u201d, but that\u2019s after they correct for\npotential model error). If that\u2019s true, a 50x fudge factor shouldn\u2019t be fatal.\n\nBut 23 orders of magnitude is fatal any way you slice it. The best one can say\nis that maybe this is no worse than normal reasoning. Among normal people who\ndon\u2019t use Rootclaim, many are sure lab leak is true, and many others are sure\nit\u2019s false. If we interpret \u201csure\u201d as 99%, then even normal people without\nRootclaim are a factor of 10,000x away from each other. If we interpret \u201csure\u201d\nas including more nines than that, maybe normal people are 23 OOMs away from\neach other, who knows? In this model, Rootclaim is no worse than anything\nelse; it\u2019s just legible enough that we notice these discrepancies. We\u2019ve\ngotten inured to people failing to agree on difficult issues. Maybe Rootclaim\ngets credit for showing us exactly where we fail, and putting numbers on the\nfailure.\n\nStill, this is faint praise for a method that hoped to be able to resolve\nthese kinds of disagreements. In the end, I think Saar has two options:\n\n  1. Abandon the Rootclaim methodology, and go back to normal boring impure reasoning like the rest of us, where you vaguely gesture at Bayesian math but certainly don\u2019t try anything as extreme as actually using it.\n\n  2. Claim that he, Saar, through his years of experience testing Rootclaim, has some kind of special metis at using it, and everyone else is screwing up.\n\nSaar gestured at (2) in the debate, repeatedly emphasizing that Rootclaim was\ndifficult and subtle. But he mostly talked about things like the Texas\nSharpshooter Fallacy, which all participants already knew about and were\ntrying to avoid. Maybe he should go further.\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t necessarily be special pleading. When psychoanalysts claim their\ntherapies work, they don\u2019t mean that someone who just read a two page \u201cWhat Is\nPsychoanalysis?\u201d pamphlet can do good therapy. They mean that someone who\nspent ten years training under someone who spent ten years training and so on\nin a lineage back to Freud can do good therapy. When scientists say the\nscientific method works, they don\u2019t mean that any crackpot who reads an Intro\nTo Science textbook can figure out the mysteries of the universe. They mean\nsomeone who\u2019s trained under other scientists and absorbed their way of\nthinking can do it.\n\nIf Saar wants to convince people, I think he should abandon his debates -\nwhich wouldn\u2019t help even if he won, and certainly don\u2019t help when he loses -\nand train five people who aren\u2019t him in how to do Rootclaim, up to standards\nwhere he admits they\u2019re as good at it as he is. Then he should prove that\nthose five people can reliably get the same answers to difficult questions,\neven when they\u2019re not allowed to compare notes beforehand. That would be\ncompelling evidence!8\n\n###\n\nThe Aftermath: Pseudoscience\n\nSuppose we accept the judges\u2019 decision that COVID arose via zoonosis. Does\nthat mean lab leak was a \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d and we should be embarrassed to\nhave ever believed it?\n\nThe term \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d is awkward here because there were definitely at\nleast two conspiracies - one by China to hide the evidence, one by western\nvirologists to convince everyone that lab leak was stupid and they shouldn\u2019t\nthink about it. Saar cited some leaked internal conversations among expert\nvirologists. Back in the earliest stage of the pandemic, they said to each\nother that it seemed like COVID could have come from a lab leak - their\nspecific odds were 50-50 - but that they should try to obfuscate this to\nprevent people from turning against them and their labs. So the best we can\nsay here is that maybe the conspiracies got lucky on their 50-50 bet, and the\nthing they were trying to cover up wasn\u2019t even true.\n\nStill, it\u2019s awkward to use \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d as an insult when the\nconspiracies were real. Maybe a better question is whether lab leak is\n\u201cpseudoscience\u201d.\n\nThe argument against: lots of smart people and experts believed it was a lab\nleak. There were all those virologists giving 50-50 odds in their internal\nconversations. Even Peter says he started out leaning lab leak, back in 2021\nwhen everyone was talking about it.\n\nThe argument in favor: since 2021, experts (and Peter) have shifted pretty far\nin favor of zoonosis. They\u2019ve been convinced by new work - the identification\nof early cases, the wet market surveys, the genetic analysis.\n\nWhat category of noun does the adjective\u201cpseudoscientific\u201d describe? It\ndoesn\u2019t necessarily describe theories: Newtonian mechanics wasn\u2019t\npseudoscience when Newton discovered it, but if someone argued for it today\n(against relativity), that would be pseudoscientific. It doesn\u2019t even describe\narguments: \u201cwe don\u2019t have enough data to confirm global warming\u201d was a strong\nargument against global warming before there were good data, and a\npseudoscientific one now. Might we place the locus of pseudoscientificness in\npeople, communities, and norms of discussion?\n\nPeter\u2019s position is that, although the lab leak theory is inherently plausible\nand didn\u2019t start as pseudoscience, it gradually accreted a community around it\nwith bad epistemic norms. Once lab leak became A Thing - after people became\nobsessed with getting one over on the experts - they developed dozens of\nfurther arguments which ranged from flawed to completely false. Peter spent\nmost of the debate debunking these - Mr. Chen\u2019s supposed 12/8 COVID case,\nConnor Reed\u2019s supposed 11/25 COVID case, the rumors of WIV researchers falling\nsick, the 90 early cases supposedly \u201chidden\u201d in a random paper, etc, etc, etc.\nPeter compares this to QAnon, where an early \u201cseed\u201d idea created an entire\ncommunity of people riffing off of it to create more and more bad facts and\narguments until they had constructed an entire alternative epistemic edifice.\n\nIf we don\u2019t accept the judges\u2019 verdict, and think lab leak is true, are we\nworried the zoonosis side has some misbehavior of its own? Yuri and Saar\ndidn\u2019t talk about that as much. High-status people misbehave in different ways\nfrom low-status people; I think the zoonosis side has plenty of things to feel\nbad about (eg the conspiracies), but pseudoscience probably isn\u2019t the right\ndescriptor.\n\n###\n\nThe Aftermath: Ebb And Flow\n\nDuring the debate, Peter accused the lab leak side of being constantly left\nflat-footed by new evidence. Sure, it had seemed plausible back in 2020, but\nthey\u2019d had to scramble to explain a steady stream of pro-zoonosis papers.\n\nAfterwards, Saar and Yuri got some new evidence of their own. A Chinese team\nappeared to have found a T/T intermediate strain of COVID in Shanghai,\npossibly imported from very early in Wuhan. If true, it would provide new\nevidence against a double spillover, instead supporting Lineage A mutating\ninto B in humans.\n\n(You can see Peter\u2019s response here - basically that we\u2019re not sure it\u2019s a true\nintermediate and not a reversion - if it were true, how come the two strains\non either side of it got millions of cases, and it just got one guy in\nShanghai? But if it were true, it would still be compatible with zoonosis -\nLineage A would have spread from an animal and quickly mutated into B, the\nfirst A case would have been someone who left the wet market for a nearby\narea, and the first B case would have been someone who stayed in the wet\nmarket.)\n\nAlso, a new Freedom of Information Act request got early drafts of the DEFUSE\ngrant proposal with new details, of which the most explosive was a comment by\nthe American half of the team, reassuring the Chinese half that even though\nthe proposal focused on American work to please funders, they would let the\nChinese side do some \u201cassays\u201d. Lab leakers say this disproves the argument\nthat, because DEFUSE said the work would be done in the US, the Wuhan\nInstitute of Virology couldn\u2019t/wouldn\u2019t do advanced gain-of-function research.\n\n(I asked Peter his response - he said the original draft of DEFUSE also said\nthat the Chinese side would do \u201clive virus binding assays\u201d, and this isn\u2019t the\nkind of gain-of-function research necessary to make COVID.)\n\nIn an email, Saar and Yuri suggested it was an \u201cinteresting coincidence\u201d that\nall the new evidence that came out after the debate favored their side. I\u2019ve\ndecided against updating on these considerations - either Peter\u2019s version or\nSaar/Yuri\u2019s. My impression is that anyone who starts out believing something\nat time t will also believe all the new evidence after time t favors that\nthing.\n\nThere\u2019s also a pattern I want to discourage, where one side will come up with\nsome new trivial finding, or re-dredge up and re-package something that\neveryone already everyone else had already considered, then release it as THE\nSMOKING GUN! Then they release another SMOKING GUN!, and another, and after\nfive or six SMOKING GUNS, they say their opponents are stubborn and refuse to\nyield to evidence, since they\u2019ve obstinately ignored every single SMOKING GUN!\nwithout changing their probability even a little bit.\n\nOverall I don\u2019t think it\u2019s useful to update on the exact contours of the ebb\nand flow of new evidence. Just treat new evidence the same as old evidence,\nupdating your model the same amount as everything else.\n\n###\n\nThe Aftermath: Debate\n\nSome skeptic blogs picked up this story last month, and one of the points they\nmade was that even if this one turned out well for their side, in general\nthey\u2019re against this kind of thing.\n\nPart of their argument was that debating \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d just helps\nspread and legitimize them. I\u2019ve made fun of this position before, and I\u2019ll\nmake fun of it again now. According to polling, about 66% of Americans believe\nlab leak, compared to 16% who believe natural origin and 17% who aren\u2019t sure.\nThat means that people with an opinion on the issue are more than 4:1 in favor\nof lab leak. At some point you have to start debating! What are you waiting\nfor? If you hold off so long that finally every single person in the world\nexcept you believes lab leak, would you still be sitting there, pristine in\nyour imperturbability, saying from your lofty height \u201cI refuse to engage,\nbecause that would be providing the rest of you oxygen\u201d?\n\nThe other part of the argument was that saying \u201cI will debate all comers for\nan $X bet\u201d is annoying, and we shouldn\u2019t encourage that kind of thing.\nCertainly this technique has been used by bad actors - for example, the\nHolocaust denial group Institute For Historical Review offered a $50,000 prize\nto anyone who could prove the Holocaust happened (it was eventually won by an\nAuschwitz survivor whose \u201cproof\u201d was that he saw his family led to the gas\nchambers; IHR failed to accept this; the survivor sued and won). Likewise,\nanti-vaccine multimillionaire Steve Kirsch has offered to bet $500,000 on the\nresults of a debate about vaccines not working9 (Saar took him up on it and\nthey\u2019re continuing to hammer out the specifics).\n\nI assume the concern is that (if the court system hadn\u2019t stepped in), the\nInstitute for Historical Review could have kept denying any evidence they were\ngiven, then kept taunting people with \u201cWe\u2019ve offered $50,000 for proof that\nthe Holocaust happened, nobody has ever won our money, so the proof must not\nexist\u201d. Or Kirsch could keep saying \u201cNobody will bet me $500,000 on vaccines,\nguess they\u2019re scared and think they don\u2019t have evidence\u201d (when in fact it\u2019s\njust that most people don\u2019t have the time, courage, and risk tolerance to do\nthis, especially when there\u2019s no guarantee the right person will win the\ndebate). In order to deny these people this weapon (the argument goes) we need\nto make it common knowledge that this strategy isn\u2019t legitimate. And taking\npeople up on their offer, having a great debate that leaves everybody more\nenlightened and serves as a model for rational discourse, then having the\nright side win in the end - seems like the opposite of delegitimizing this\nstrategy.\n\nI guess I classify this with all the other examples in Less Utilitarian Than\nThou. Cool Machiavellian plot you have there, but maybe the fact that you\u2019re\nlosing 16%-66% should make you question whether you\u2019re really as smart as you\nthink you are, and whether your plan to suppress all discussion for the\ngreater good is really the mastermind-level strategy you hoped it would be.\n\nIt\u2019s good to assert the true fact that these kinds of challenges are often\ndumb/rigged/useless, and that \u201cnobody has yet responded to my challenge\u201d isn\u2019t\na valid argument that someone\u2019s necessarily right. But I stop short of trying\nto set some kind of social norm that nobody may respond to anyone else\u2019s\nchallenges, even if they think that person is being honest and has organized\nthe challenge well (as Saar was and did). That almost seems like itself\nlegitimizing the whole thing, in the sense of accepting that if someone loses\na challenge then it means something important. I would rather place the\nillegitimacy where it belongs (a challenge really doesn\u2019t prove anything,\nseparate from the arguments made in it) and let people do what they want.\n\nI want to see more debates like this. I learned more watching the 15 hours of\nRootclaim debate than I think I would have researching on my own for 15 hours.\nBut a lot of things had to come together to make this work. Most of all, this\ndebate worked out because the judges were two very smart scientists with\nrelevant expertise. To get such good judges, lots of things had to fall into\nplace.\n\nFirst, the debate itself had to be expensive enough that neither side\nbegrudged paying the extra $5,000 per judge to hire the best people.\n\nAnd second, the debate had to be about a topic where lots of intelligent\npeople haven\u2019t yet made up their minds. If the debate was about flat earth, I\nwould despair of finding good judges. Either the judges would already be\nconvinced the Earth was round (which the flat Earth side would understandably\nrefuse to accept). Or they would be 50-50, which would mean they were\nextremely weird people whose reasoning couldn\u2019t be trusted. Flat Earth is an\nextreme example, but even a debate about COVID vaccines would be pushing it\nhere.\n\n(since writing this, I learned Peter had made this same argument and analogy\nin a blog post on Kirsch; sorry for the unintentional plagiarism)\n\nI think I would genuinely update on the conclusion of any other Rootclaim\ndebate with the same caliber of participants as this one, but not necessarily\non whatever Steve Kirsch or the Institute of Historical Review comes up with,\nnor the next person to hit on the strategy of \u201cI\u2019ll pay you $100,000 if you\nprove me wrong!\u201d10\n\n###\n\nThe Aftermath: Conclusion\n\nThis was one of my favorite topics to write about this year, for a few\nreasons.\n\nFirst, on the object level, I learned a lot about the origins of COVID, which\nis a great story. I feel like I know much more now about this disease that\ncame out of nowhere and ruined all of our lives for a few years. It\u2019s a weird\nrabbit hole, which I\u2019m not yet entirely out of. I have a weird urge to visit\nWuhan as a tourist, see the Wuhan Institute of Virology, stroll through the\nHuanan Central Seafood Market (unfortunately closed), maybe eat a raccoon-dog.\n\nSecond, some of the lessons of this debate are actionable. I\u2019ve written before\nabout how we should learn the lessons of lab leak even if it turns out to be\nfalse this time; that hasn\u2019t changed. But this was a good reminder to also\nlearn the lessons of zoonosis, for the same reason. We need more attention on\nclosing wet markets and tracking weird Chinese wildlife. The DEFUSE proposal\nwanted to immunize bats - is this still a wortwhile idea? The virologists got\na bad rap for wanting to gain-of-function exactly the pathogen that caused the\ncentury\u2019s worst pandemic, but in a way that speaks well of them - they clearly\nknew what to be worried about. Has anyone mumbled an apology and asked them if\nthey have any other useful predictions?\n\nThird, John Nerst has written about erisology, the study of disagreements.\nThis was surely one of history\u2019s greatest erisological studies. Two very smart\npeople spent fifteen hours hashing out every argument and counterargument in\ngood faith, then quantified all of their beliefs in a way that lets us figure\nout exactly where they differed and by how much. This isn\u2019t entirely a victory\n- as a newly minted member of team zoonosis, I still can\u2019t trace exactly why\nSaar is so sure I\u2019m wrong. But if the COVID origin story fascinates me as this\npeek deep into a pestiferous underworld of sinister laboratories and reeking\nwet markets, something about this debate felt like analogous peek into the\ncreepy subconscious swamps where disagreements begin.\n\nFourth, for the first time it made me see the coronavirus as one of God\u2019s\nbiggest and funniest jokes. Think about it. Either a zoonotic virus crossed\nover to humans fifteen miles from the biggest coronavirus laboratory in the\nEastern Hemisphere. Or a lab leak virus first rose to public attention right\nnear a raccoon-dog stall in a wet market. Either way is one of the century\u2019s\nbiggest coincidences, designed by some cosmic joker who wanted to keep the\ndebate stayed acrimonious for years to come.\n\nBut fifth, if the coronavirus\u2019 story is a comedy, all of this - Rootclaim, the\ndebate, the $100K - is a tragedy. Saar got $100 million, decided to devote a\nbig part of his life to improving human reasoning, and came up with a really\nelegant system. He was so confident in his system, and in the power of open\ndiscussion, that he risked his money and reputation on an accept-all-comers\ndebate offer . Then some rando who nobody had ever heard of accepted the\nchallenge, turned out to be some kind of weird debate savant, and won, turning\nwhat should have been Rootclaim\u2019s moment of triumph into a bitter defeat.\nTotally new kind of human suffering, worthy of Shakespeare.\n\nI look forward to the movie, especially seeing who plays the dashing young\nblogger who helped the participants meet.\n\n##\n\nOther Resources\n\n  * Daniel Filan\u2019s running Twitter commentary of the debate\n\n  * Daniel\u2019s Bayesian analysis Google Doc\n\n  * Peter\u2019s blog, with some articles on his COVID investigation\n\n  * Rootclaim site\n\n  * Philipp Markolin\u2019s article (preachy, annoying, but has good interview with Peter)\n\n  * Another debate paralleling this one on Less Wrong, starting with Roko for lab leak, and with viking_math and EZ97 on the zoonosis side.\n\n  * Both sides emailed me excitedly about this claim by Marc Johnson to have found COVID regressing back to its original gut virus form. Johnson claims the regression pattern suggests COVID spent significant time in some non-bat animal before progressing to humans, although this doesn\u2019t distinguish between an intermediate host (eg raccoon-dog) or an animal-based culture medium at a lab (eg human airway cells). Yuri thinks you might be able to run COVID ancestors through different animals and media to see which one produces COVID-characteristic mutations, which might help resolve this debate.\n\n  * Interview with Saar about Rootclaim (not the lab leak debate) in Israeli news\n\n  * Michael Weissman has an excellent Bayesian analysis favoring lab leak, which I unfortunately didn\u2019t include in my table because it would have taken too long to translate his language into mine.\n\n  * Judge Eric has a site about the debate and a blog including a response to Michael Weissman.\n\n  * If you want to try doing your own analysis in the same style as the ones above, I\u2019ve put a calculator up here. You\u2019ll have to copy it to your own Google Drive before adding your own numbers. If you do try it, please link your results here (after setting share settings to \u201canyone with the link\u201d) so I can try to aggregate everybody\u2019s work later. The calculator has not been exhaustively tested and might be wrong/buggy, please let me know if you notice problems.\n\n1\n\n15 hours of watching/moderating the debate, and the rest was a combination of\nresearch (to double-check participants\u2019 claims) and writing their verdicts.\n\n2\n\nPotential conflict of interest notice: I handled escrow for this bet, and was\npaid $1,000.\n\n3\n\nMaking these tables was tough, both because everyone\u2019s analysis had a slightly\ndifferent structure, and because you have to be careful not to accidentally\ndouble-count factors. Peter and I got in an argument over whether having a\nprior for a given pandemic being lab leak, a factor for the pandemic starting\nin Wuhan in particular, and a factor for how likely the virus was to escape\nfrom WIV was implicitly double-counting things. I eventually settled for\nsomething like his presentation, but I\u2019ve probably managed to mess it up\nsomehow. Sorry in advance if this analysis turns out not to make sense.\n\n4\n\nA separate market on the lab leak hypothesis itself shifted less, from about\n70% to 60%. This could either be because bettors thought Peter was a great\ndebater but wasn\u2019t actually right, or because most people in this (very large)\nmarket didn\u2019t even watch the debate. In general I\u2019m not optimistic about\nmarkets with no plausible way of ever being resolved.\n\n5\n\nIn a discussion on this point, Saar says he\u2019s suspicious even of 1-in-10,000\nlevel evidence on one side, because even if you\u2019re right, you might be\nignoring outside-of-model error. I accept that this is a valid point, but\ncounter with this article on how Strong Evidence Is Common. For example,\nsuppose I win the lottery, I\u2019m told I win the lottery, the lottery company\ngives me a big check, I cash the check, and I become rich. Given that there\nwere 1-in-100-million odds against me winning the lottery, the lottery company\ngiving me the check and so on must be at least 100-million-to-1-level evidence\n- otherwise I should refuse to believe I really won the lottery, even as I\nenjoy my newfound wealth! This is a kind of stupid and trivial point, but I\nstill think it\u2019s useful to remember. The reason 1-in-10,000 level odds are\nrare in arguments isn\u2019t because they\u2019re rare in real life, it\u2019s because if\nthere\u2019s an argument it means there\u2019s a smart person on the other side who\u2019s\nnot interpreting the odds the same way you do, so you might be wrong.\n\n6\n\nI wouldn\u2019t really describe our interaction this way. I started with a 10,000x\nBayes factor on the market, but it was extremely lightly considered and not\nreally adjusted for out-of-model error. Based on our discussions, I divided by\nfour based on Saar\u2019s good point that the market represented less than 100% of\nthe possible zoonotic spread opportunity in Wuhan (I cashed this out as it\nrepresenting 25% of opportunity, though with high error bars). Then I divided\nby an extra factor of five representing some sort of blind outside view\nadjustment based on how strongly Saar holds his position (this was kind of\nalso a decision to explicitly include potential outside-the-model error\nbecause that would make discussing it with Saar easier).\n\n7\n\nThe end probability on my analysis (95% zoonosis) is pretty close to my\ngenuinely held probability (~90% zoonosis). But this is a coincidence - my\noriginal calculation had some errors, it returned 99.999% zoonosis, and I\nplanned to ignore it and continued to believe ~90% zoonosis. I don\u2019t claim to\nbe good enough at explicit probabilistic analysis that you should take my\nresults seriously.\n\n8\n\nOr he should enter forecasting contests. I hope to talk to him more about\nspecifics of this option.\n\n9\n\nSome people have since claimed that Kirsch\u2019s debate offer isn\u2019t honest - see\nhttps://twitter.com/SkepticJonGuy/status/1665071649555906561 and\nhttps://twitter.com/SwaledaleMutton/status/1721170306788630713.\n\n10\n\nIt would also be interesting to have a respected central institution that runs\nthese kinds of debates, just as longbets.org is a respected central\ninstitution that runs bets.\n\n### Subscribe to Astral Codex Ten\n\nBy Scott Alexander\n\nP(A|B) = [P(A)*P(B|A)]/P(B), all the rest is commentary.\n\n341 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n28 Restacks\n\n341\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Practically-A-Book Review: Rootclaim $100,000 Lab Leak Debate\n\nwww.astralcodexten.com\n\n896\n\nShare\n\nShare this discussion\n\n#### Practically-A-Book Review: Rootclaim $100,000 Lab Leak Debate\n\nwww.astralcodexten.com\n\n896 Comments\n\n  * New First\n  * Chronological\n\nDeiseachMar 28\"Either a zoonotic virus crossed over to humans fifteen miles\nfrom the biggest coronavirus laboratory in the Eastern Hemisphere.\"As they\nsay, 'you couldn't make it up'.

This alone rules out raccoon dogs as plausible\nhosts for two independently sufficient reasons. Firstly, there is unanimity in\nthe literature that the bat ancestral virus to SARS-CoV-2 is in southern\nYunnan or South East Asia. Everyone agrees with this, including Shi Zhengli.\nIf a species was wild caught in Hubei, then there would be no explanation of\nhow it acquired the ancestral bat virus, given that Hubei is 1000 miles from\nsouthern Yunnan.Secondly, a mystery of sars-cov-2 is how it acquired the furin\ncleavage site that makes it so transmissible. There are 850 known sars-like\ncoronaviruses, and only one with a furin cleavage site. According to private\nmessages exchanged by proponents of zoonosis, the furin cleavage site could\nnot have been acquired in the market because the density of animals was too\nlow (only 3-4 per cage). When avian influenza acquires a furin cleavage site\nthat occurs on farms with thousands of chickens densely packed, i.e. not in\nthe wild and not when there are a handful of animals in cages in a market.\nhttps://usrtk.org/covid-19-origins/visual-timeline-proximal-origin/2\\. Wang et\nal (2022) https://academic.oup.com/ve/article/8/1/veac046/6601809 also\nconfirms that the raccoon dogs were wild caught in Hubei. What's more, Wang et\nal (2022) tested 15 wild raccoon dogs of suppliers of Wuhan markets, including\nthe Huanan market, in January 2020 and found them to be negative for SARS-\nCoV-2. On average, 38 raccoon dogs were sold across the four markets in Wuhan\nfrom 2017 to 2019. So, the 15 raccoon dogs likely comprised nearly the whole\ninventory of raccoon dogs that would have been supplied to the Huanan market\nat the time.In short, the raccoon dogs supplied to the market were tested and\nwere negative.

Here, rational evidence easily\ntrumps claims made based on scientific evidence: a child could see if\nexplained to that no matter how many unidentified cases there might be,\nthere's no way for IFR to be lower than total excess mortality within the\npopulation. And additionally, I have a clear model where the people working in\nthe institute with their virology doctorate doctorate degrees went wrong: they\nrely (indeed, might be contractually obligated to, I haven't checked) on\nscientific studies, but as none had been published at such an early stage,\nthey pattern-match to the most closely analogous study, which might be about\nflu or something.

However, just because you can imagine\na hypothetical in which this might happen, doesn't mean it's remotely likely,\nespecially when characteristics like who is involved and how competent they\nare change from argument to argument. China is not omnipotent and frankly\nprobably doesn't care much about lab leak vs zoonosis. Let's consider the\nepidemological data pointing to the market, which is often alleged to be\ntainted.1\\. The Chinese government first tried to cover up the existence of\nthe pandemic at all, and failed. Also, as Peter points out, if it started much\nearlier, you would have many times more deaths, which is even harder to cover\nup.2\\. They also tried to cover up (or at least, were incompetent) the wet\nmarket, by claiming animal testing showed no results, but then it turned out\nthey hadn't actually tested live animals (roughly, I might be getting details\nwrong here).3\\. Now they claim the virus started in the US; if they were\ntrying to fake evidence of this, they would have had cases cluster near an\nairport or hotel or something, not a market that is almost exclusively visited\nby residents.4\\. There's multiple different lines of evidence that point to\nthe market, which makes it increasingly unlikely that China could manipulate\nall of them in a way that's undetectable.5\\. If you don't believe the market\ndata, why do you believe the pandemic started in Wuhan at all? Couldn't China\nbe trying to hide, like a secret bioweapon plant in a different city?

Do you\nhave more specifics?(Even in the case of lab leak, there might not have been\nany such cover up--I have seen the theory that the leak was totally accidental\nand came directly from samples, so they might not have even realized at first\neven if they were to blame, and WIV workers were behaving pretty normally\nthrough December at least. Conversely, even in the case of zoonosis, panicked\nworkers could have engaged in some sort of cover up if they had some vague\nidea they might be considered responsible.

As far as\nI can recall, I don't think Rootclaim really dove into this point, but rather\njust used it at a very high level (\"those data could be wrong, so the evidence\nprovided is weak\") so the judges may have just taken it has most likely that\nthe data are accurate.Keep in mind that the data merely being limited (which\nis known to be the case) doesn't necessarily tell you much, because you have\nto explain why the cases cluster at the *market* specifically.

The Chinese government\nfirst tried to cover up the existence of the pandemic...It's a bit more\nnuanced than that. When people started coming down with mysterious cases of a\npneumonia-like disease during the first weeks of December, the local hospital\nMDs and administrators alerted the health authorities of Wuhan, and they in\nturn notified the Mayor of Wuhan and the Governor of Hubei. The mayor and the\ngovernor tried to hush it up because a big party convention was scheduled to\nbe held in Wuhan (early in Jan IIRC). The mayor and governor of Hubei Province\ndecided to go forward with the conference. They felt a small outbreak of some\nunknown pathogen would reflect poorly on their administration, and they didn't\nalert the national authorities to the outbreak\u2014until people were crowding the\nemergency wards, and they couldn't cover up all the hospitalized patients.\n(This would have been around the third week of December when they couldn't\ncover it up anymore\u2014although it didn't reach the Western media until the first\nweek of January.)Local dithering and silence wasted two critical weeks, but\nsome of the hospital MDs notified the folks across the river at the WIV, and\nthey were able to alert the National Health Commission of the PRC that they\nsuspected they had a SARS-like outbreak on their hands. Not long after the MDs\nwere beaten and arrested by local Gong An Bu, probably at the behest of the\nlocal authorities who were embarrassed about the outbreak happening on their\nwatch (again, it's unclear who directed them to do this, but the Mayor and the\nGovernor had the motive).The national health authorities took the warning\nseriously, and they informed Chairman Xi that the situation was potentially\nquite serious. He immediately fired the Mayor (and then the Governor) for\nincompetence and he sent in a hand-picked troubleshooter to handle the\nsituation. (I wasn't able to find out what happened to the mayor and governor.\nI don't know if they were allowed to fade into private life or were maximally\ndisciplined.) Once the National-level health authorities assessed the\nsituation (and it took them about a week), they alerted the WHO at the end of\nDecember, and the Chinese started sharing data with the WHO, the ECDC and the\nCDC. The local coverup wasted two critical weeks, but it was at the local\nlevel, and not at the national level.> 2\\. They also tried to cover up (or at\nleast, were incompetent) the wet market...Due to the case cluster, the Chinese\nnational health authorities immediately focused on the wet markets in that\ndistrict. SARS1 and some Avian Flu outbreaks had started at wet markets, so\nthe wet markets within the initial case cluster were immediately suspect. And\nonce it was clear that they had something dangerous on their hands, public\nhealth authorities immediately shut down the wet markets in Wuhan (I believe\nthey shut them all down all over the city). The animals were disposed of, and\nthe market stalls were disinfected. From a public health perspective, this was\na wise decision\u2014but from a data-gathering perspective, they lost the chance to\ntest the animals when they incinerated the carcasses. Again, I may be\nmisremembering some of the details but they invited the WHO to visit the site\nin mid-January. Either the Chinese or the Chinese with the WHO collected swabs\nof DNA and RNA from the stalls. So the disinfection happened after they\ncollected the DNA and RNA. The Chinese sequenced the virus and they sent the\ngenome to the WHO, to ECDC, and the CDC on January 15th. It wasn't until March\nwhen the CIA director and Trump started accusing the Chinese of covering up a\nlab leak that the Chinese stopped cooperating with us. Then naturally, they\nblamed us for creating the virus.It's important to note that wild animal\nfarming is a 7 billion dollar business in Hubei, and Wuhan is the second only\nto Guangzhou as a transshipment center for the animals and their byproducts.\nIt's a big business, and the authorities don't want to see it shut down\nbecause it lines their own pockets. So their impulse is to cover up instead of\ndisclose because of all of the negative attention they've garnered\nworldwide.Expand full commentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nanomieMar 28\u00b7edited Mar 28What's important to realize here is that the CCP\ndoesn't want evidence to exist for *either* of these theories.

Both sides in the debate agree that Mr\nChen contracted symptoms on 16th Dec. This suggests he was exposed around 10th\nDec. He thinks he was exposed on the train or in hospital on 8th Dec.This\nraises two problems:1\\. Mr Chen lived 30km away from the Huanan market on the\nsouth of the river, and never went anywhere near it in December, according to\nhis interviews. His case was only recorded because he happened to be\ntransferred to the top tier Wuhan Central Hospital, which is a sentinel\nhospital for respiratory outbreaks in Wuhan. It is in the north of the river\nfrom his local hospital because his relative happened to work there. This is\nevidence of a geographical bias in he case search. How many other cases were\nmissed on the south of the river because they happened not to visit top tier\nhospitals, which were largely near the market.Geographic bias in the case\nsearch is also confirmed by:\\- Literal statements to the effect that 'we\nfocused too much on the market' by the man in charge of the case search\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m001ng7c\\- A mountain of evidence in\nofficial Chinese documents of a market-bias in the case search.\nhttps://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/mbio.00313-23\\- This short\nstatistical argument -https://academic.oup.com/jrsssa/advance-article-\nabstract/doi/10.1093/jrsssa/qnae021/7632556?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=false\nCases with no links to the market were closer to the market than linked cases.\nThis is evidence FOR ascertainment bias in the case search.2\\. Given that\nthere was a confirmed case 30km from the market around 10th of December, this\nsuggests widespread community transmission across Wuhan in early December and\nlate November. i.e. not that there was a zoonosis in early Dec. The first\nconfirmed case was on 10th/11th Dec (even for that case, it is unclear whether\nthe first case was market linked). There was no published retrospective case\nsearch. The first case was initially thought to be 1st Dec. Usually if you do\ncontact tracing and a case search, the first official case goes backward in\ntime.

This would not have happened for the other people with covid in\nJiangxia (30km from the market) at that time. This suggests that there were\nlots of cases (not just mr chen) probably in late November far from the\nmarket. Does that make sense?Expand full commentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nAristophanesApr 2What the selection mechanism is really depends on what data\ngenerating procedure you are hypothesizing.A) Suppose Mr Chen (and 100 others)\nare \"successfully\" exposed to Covid while in hospital c. Dec 14. Some of those\npeople will have short incubation periods, some will have long ones. By\nchance, Mr Chen happens to be the one with the shortest window, has symptoms\nby Dec 16. Someone goes \"woah, the average incubation to symptoms is 5-6 days,\nso he probably caught it pre-hospital\", on Dec 10 on average, before the first\nknown wet market case. This would be a mistake - the reason we're noticing Mr\nChen in this story is we're selecting on the fact he got symptoms quickly. But\nin that case, you should see all his exposed hospital cohort come down with\nsymptoms over the following week. (Note that if the hypothesis is that Mr Chen\nis the only / one of the few that got exposed in hospital at this time / by\nthe same source, then we haven't actually strongly selected him on \"got\ninfected quickly\", and his early symptom date returns to being a relative\nsurprise - and thus evidence against \"infected in hospital\" vs \"infected pre-\nhospital\". Not a 100-1 factor - quick symptom onset isn't that rare. But a 5-1\nor a 10-1 factor is possible).B) Suppose instead the hypothesis is (per your\nnearby comment, paraphrasing), \"the first known case - the shrimp vendor who\ngot symptoms on Dec 11, probably wasn't actually the first human case, she\ncould easily be anywhere in generation 2-4+, lots of cases are undetected, one\nof those chains infects Mr Chen on the train on the 8th/10th/whatever\", then\nsure, his early symptom date (Dec 16) is easy to explain away (i.e. we don't\nneed to appeal to quick hospital infection). But the way we explain it away is\n\"potentially lots of undetected non-market transmission prior to the first\n*detected* market case\". In this 'world', there's no/minimal selection into\nnoticing (in the data, not by us) Mr Chen just because he got sick quickly (in\nfact, we would have only very weak evidence he got sick quickly, but in the\nsame manner as is true for any early case detection: if a + b is low, some of\nthis accrues to our estimate of E(a) and some to E(b)). Rather he was captured\nin the data for the idiosyncratic reasons that he was transferred to a\nspecific hospital well away from where he lived. But then, this implies there\nare likely many other early unlinked cases like Mr Chen that never made the\nofficial data counts because - unlike Mr Chen - they did not share his\nidiosyncratic hospital transfer. If we only captured Mr Chen in the data due\nto 1 in a 100 luck, there were probably 100 others like him. Which then is\nstrong evidence of geographic/travel history bias in detection of early cases.\n(That the search was geographically/travel history biased seems very clear -\nboth in the primary sources that list linkage to the wet market as a necessary\nrequirement through mid January 2020, and in the fact that epidemiologically\nunlinked cases in the early data are physically closer to the wet market than\nlinked cases. This is a smoking gun for non-random search. See links provided\nby others above).So in some sense, Mr Chen only raises the probability of two\nthings that were already quite probable.(i) the earliest infections were never\ncaptured in the data; the first case is probably several generations in.(ii)\nthe early data was biased in searching for cases near/linked to the wet\nmarket(Note that both of these things follow - in the sense of raised\nprobability - from Mr Chen's case even if, by a huge fluke, he was the only\ninfection (in his generation) in the unlinked/undetected transmission chain he\nwas a part of. Whether there was 0 others, or whether there was 100 people\nlike him is relatively immaterial - it's just ex post chance. However many\ninfections did exist, they are unlikely to have been detected).But both (i)\nand (ii) are bad for the wet market hypothesis. If we knew that we had\ndetected the location of the first infected person, \"it happened at the wet\nmarket\" would have a large odds ratio for the zoonotic hypothesis. But if we\nmerely know \"well, lots of generation 3-4-5 cases happened at the wet market\",\nthe relevant question is Pr(lots of gen 3-4-5 cases at wet market| zoonotic) /\nPr(lots of gen 3-4-5 cases at the wet market|lab leak). But the characteristic\nthat makes a wet market have a high chance of hosting spread for gen 3-4-5\ncases has ~nothing to do with the wild animals present, and instead loads very\nheavily on \"how good a location is this for superspreading\" * \"how likely is\nit that authorities will notice / get suspicious quickly of a linked outbreak\nat this location (due to the history of SARS CoV 1 etc).\" But this conditional\nprobability differs *much* less between zoonotic and LL, and becomes\nincreasingly weak evidence the bigger a phenomena (ii) is.As a simple example,\nconsider the Omicron outbreak in Australia, where testing was very good at the\nstart (and we know the first cases had to be imported from overseas). The\nfirst imported case was discovered in Sydney on November 27. The first\ncommunity transmission was discovered on December 3. On Dec 8, 680 people\n\"checked in\" to a nightclub about 2 hours north of Sydney. It was a super-\nspreader event, 295 of them tested\npositive.https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-12-15/newcastle-omicron-outbreak-\nlargest-covid-superspreader-\nevent/100699092https://www.newcastleherald.com.au/story/7634098/study-shows-\nhow-two-men-infected-hundreds-at-argyle-house/If testing/detection had been\nless widespread (as is inevitable early on in an outbreak, e.g. in Wuhan),\nthese nightclub cases would be the first detected.

She probably wasn't the first human\ncase, because she didn't interact with the raccoon-dogs; more likely a\nraccoon-dog vendor got (quietly) sick first and spread it to some other\nvendors. It's not even clear she was in the second batch of cases - only 5-10%\nof COVID gets detected, probably less when it was first starting, so she could\nbe anywhere from one to four transmissions away from human Patient Zero. So\nhuman Patient Zero probably got sick in late November or early December.Let's\nsay Patient Zero got COVID November 27 (with high error bars).

Or in any case \u201ca\ndiscrete event with a much higher rate of infection than the base rate\nexpected by the observed growth rate of the epidemic\u201d.Peter is saying the wet\nmarket doesn\u2019t look like that, it looks like a \u201cnormal\u201d rate of infection and\ngrowth in cases.Why does that matter? The two sides of the argument both need\nto explain why the epidemic was first detected and seemed to spread from the\nWuhan market, rather than somewhere else.Saar\u2019s claim is that basically Covid\nleaked from the lab sometime prior to the wet market outbreak, and was\ncirculating around at a low rate, but a \u201csuperspreader\u201d event in the wet\nmarket made it the epicenter of subsequent infections. This theory takes a\nmajor hit if the spread in the wet market was not atypical, because in that\ncase the market should just be one of many similar outbreak sites started by\nthe various infected folks circulating around, rather than a clear\nepicenter.Peter claims that the wet market was the actual origin of the\nzoonotic transmission. It looks like it all spread from there because it *did*\nall spread from there. The fact that there was nothing \u201csuper\u201d about the\nspread at the market supports this theory - wet market infections don\u2019t need\nto swamp other potential epicenters because there are no other\nepicenters.Expand full commentReply (1)Share  \n---  \n  \nREFMar 28No, superspreader is, \"went to my own wedding with COVID and kissed\nall 200 guests.Expand full commentReply (1)Share  \n---  \n  \nGbdubMar 28Either way, it comes down to one person infecting way more than the\naverage 0-2 people per case, right?Expand full commentReply (1)Share  \n---  \n  \nREFMar 28It does.

Such a scenario is a priori unlikely for\nlab leak, since it requires a lab worker to go to the market and infect\nsomeone there, but infect no one anywhere else, either in the lab or in\nbetween, since there are no other early clusters. To make this hypothesis seem\nmore plausible, Rootclaim asserted that the market provided very good\nconditions for much faster growth of Covid, possibly even a superspreader\nevent (i.e. a case where a single person infects a dozen or several dozen\npeople all at once, greatly in excess of the average number of secondary\ninfections, which for early covid is less than 2. This would explain why the\nmarket dominates the early cases, but as Peter points out, these claims have\nno evidence and are contradicted by available data. If the spreading rate is\nthe same inside the market as everywhere else, then the strong clustering of\nearly cases to the market is very good evidence in favor of the pandemic\nstarting there (and thus, in favor of zoonosis).Bu the upshot is that this\nargument is specifically a response to Rootclaim's argument, so if you don't\nbelieve the latter, then this part would be irrelevant for you.Expand full\ncommentReply (1)Share  \n---  \n  \nGbdubMar 28This is a better summary than I was able to put together.I think\nRootclaim needs to defend their assertion of a superspreader event at the\nmarket, because otherwise Peter seems to have convincingly shown that it\nwasn\u2019t, and if it wasn\u2019t it\u2019s pretty good evidence in favor of the wet market\ntheory.Expand full commentReply (1)Share  \n---  \n  \nAlex ZavolukMar 28I don't think they're going to do that, and from Saar's\npoint of view they don't really need to.

Proline is not part of\nany FCS motif, however, the amino acid is considered a helix-breaker;\nsomething that will mess up your protein structure with a high probability.\nWhy risk introducing that?\\- Even more curious, the whole sequence insertion\nis \"out-of-frame\", meaning the nucleotides were not introduced neatly but\nrather staggered for no reason, again something that scientists would not do\nordinarily (or at all)\\- However, the FCS insertion is right next to an RNA\nsequence motif prone for copy-choice recombination, arguing for this natural\nmechanism bringing it about (and copy-choice recombination is reading-frame\nindependent and favors out-of-frame insertions 2:1)\\- The GC content of the\ninsertion is 83%, very unusual for artificial introductions\\- The coded amino\nacids themselves make an odd, non-canonical, and weak recognition motif (RRXR)\nfor furin-like proteases; a motif that might ordinarily not work compared to\nstrong motifs such as RRSRR (which would usually be used by virologists).\\-\nThe FCS cleavage at S1/S2 destabilizes the original (Wuhan-Hu-1) spike\nprotein, which only got compensated partially when the D614G mutation emerged\nquickly in the early pandemic, arguing for a recent acquisition, not design or\ncell culture\\- Furthermore, potentially because the FCS in the original SARS-\nCOV-2 is not that stable, it is lost very quickly in Vero cells and other\ntypical cell culture systems. Selection pressures seem to run against it in\nthese research-associated amplification systems; so how exactly did an FCS-\ncontaining virus that first has to be amplified in cell culture before it can\ninfect a researcher escape from a lab and do so with an FCS?But these alone is\nnot proof. Who knows what weird and arcane experiments those Chinese\nresearchers would cook up in a lab, right? (Some lab leak truthers with no\nmolecular biology experience would say. For actual genetic engineers, the\nsituation is already clear as day) Fortunately, we do not need to rely on\nexperience or speculations about any motivations or experimental procedures\nChinese scientists might have followed.This is because nature just has more\nsecrets hidden in the FCS that humans could not have come up with in the first\nplace:After intensive mechanistic studies of the FCS in SARS-CoV-2,\nresearchers discovered a hitherto unknown synergistic interplay between the\nodd, suboptimal FCS and the genetic backbone of the virus (which we by now\nknow is natural because of recombination).\\- We have learned that pre-cleavage\nof SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 by furin is what boost TMPRSS2-mediated cell fusion and\nthus impacts cellular tropism and transmission dynamics (ergo infectivity)\\-\nBut it turns out, that was not the full mechanistic story. In nature, no\ngenetic element acts alone\\- The viral QTQTN amino acid motif is an uncommon\nnatural sequence in several sarbecovirus spike proteins directly upstream of\nthe FCS sequence\\- In cell culture experiments, QTQTN is not stable and\nrepeatedly lost, similar to the FCS. Loss results in impaired viral\nreplication.\\- QTQTN determines how tightly the loop harboring the FCS is\nbound to the spike protein, thus it regulates spike protein stability and\nshapes how well the Golgi-bound furin-like proteases have access to recognize\nthe FCS motif and pre-cleave at S1/S2\\- The QTQTN motif is also glycosylated\nand loss of that glycosylation impairs viral replication as well.\\-\nResearchers showed beautifully that there is an intricate functional interplay\nbetween the FCS, the loop length, and glycosylation: These separate but co-\ndependent elements work together synergistically and all elements are\nultimately required for efficient FCS pre-cleavage (and with it, impact viral\nreplication and pathogenesis). In nature, no genetic element acts alone.Co-\ndependency and synergy between genetic elements are hallmarks of evolutionary\nselection; these type of complex interactions are extremely hard to design for\neven with perfect knowledge of all structural components, which nobody had in\n2019. In the case of SARS-CoV-2's FCS, there is no conceivable way how\nengineers could have designed the observed - but hitherto undiscovered -\nmechanistic synergy purposefully.Take this together with all the other\nunexplainable design choices listed above; and you have your answer.

It is correct to say that if there were an unknown virus that\nthe WIV following the workflow outlined in DEFUSE, the insert could have been\nout of frame but could not have been. From a Bayesian point of view, one has\nto weigh this against the possibility that the furin cleavage site emerged\nnaturally in a farm in Hubei. The 850 sars-like coronavirus don't have a furin\ncleavage site, suggesting it is selected against in nature.One also has to\nthink about the timing of the acquisition when weighing the probabilities. The\nfurin cleavage site emerged the year after the WIV was on a proposal to insert\nthe site. The mutations in the virus also suggest that the furin cleavage site\nemerged recently around Oct/Nov. Choe and Farzan (2021) argue that \u201cThe\nnotable emergence of D614G suggests that the acquisition of a destabilizing\nfurin site was a recent event\u201d. So, zoonosis has to posit that the furin\ncleavage site emerged only once naturally, was never found in nature despite\nthem looking, and caused approx 1-2 spillovers in Wuhan city.Expand full\ncommentReply (1)Share  \n---  \n  \ntgof137Heterodox HeresyMar 29\u00b7edited Mar 29Yes. I dealt with it in a\nprobabilistic manner by assuming the original virus could have different\ncodons.I suppose what you really want is the ratio, i.e. 1/3rd of natural\ninserts would be in frame, but let's assume closer to 100% of lab inserts\nwould be in frame, so you could change my numbers that way. But I was already\nbeing generous by assuming that the natural viruses have even priors for all\ncodons at that spot, when it's actually out of frame for every one we know\nabout.The presence of the furin cleavage site itself is dealt with separately\nin the probabilities. To some degree that may just be included in your priors\n-- i.e. the judges both assumed a serious coronavirus pandemic on the order of\n1 in 100 years, it wouldn't be serious without the furin cleavage site, so\nit's double counting to include that.Saar used a factor of 2, that the lab\npandemic is twice as likely as the natural pandemic to have such a site.\nThat's probably double counting, but maybe not, since his pandemic prior was 1\nin 20 years. I could see going up to a factor of 5 here since we don't know\nexactly how often the serious coronavirus pandemics are.Then the last question\nis do you get separate odds for it being an \"inserted FCS\" vs just an FCS.\nThis is the real thing Saar thinks is important, he gave it a factor of 50 at\nthe debate but later said he privately thinks it's 1 in a billion, or\nsomething like that. He thinks that the lab would totally put a 12 NT insert\ninto a coronavirus but nature could never do that.Strangely, he actually has\nthat backwards -- no lab in history has ever inserted 12 NT's to make a\ncleavage site. They typically mutate existing amino acids, rather than\ninserting. On the other hand, nature has shown that it repeatedly does 12 NT\ninsertions at random spots, including sometimes at or near the FCS. So the\nodds here probably actually lean towards nature, if you understand how\nvirologists normally work (Saar does not).It's not the least bit clear that\nthe DEFUSE grant suggests to \"insert the site\" -- that's a highly motivated\nreasoning that few virologists agree with.Finally, the fact that this is a\nsarbecovirus with a furin cleavage site is kind of weird -- it's never been\nobserved in such a bat virus. But those are enteric viruses, not respiratory\nviruses, so the FCS is selected against. In an intermediate host, it's quite\nlikely that this feature would be selected for. We just don't know of many\nsarbecoviruses which have spilled over into something else... I think that's\njust SARS1, SARS2, and a couple pangolin viruses? Maybe there are others I\ndon't know about.So it's kind of a 0 divided by 0 situation, going off prior\nodds. 0 out of 5 labs have done anything like this. 0 out of 3 natural viruses\nwere just like this.Very hard to look at that situation and confidently assign\nsome strong bayes factor for the lab.Expand full commentReply (1)Share  \n---  \n  \nSimon statsMar 30Thanks for the very detailed comment, it's very helpful. I\nwas more thinking of Markolin's claim that the FCS definitely wasn't inserted,\nwhich seems wrong.How do you interpret what DEFUSE says their plan is with\nrespect to the FCS? Did you see those recent FOIA documents where they have an\narrow with FCS pointing to the S1/S2 junction, which is where the FCS is in\nsars2?Isn't one part of the update from DEFUSE the timing? They put in this\nresearch proposal in 2018. The WIV has a history of copying leading edge work\ndone by Baric but at lower biosafety. The next year, something broadly in-\nkeeping with that workflow emerges in Wuhan. Whereas the odds on a coronavirus\nemerging naturally with an FCS are just spread out over 100 years.Regarding\nthe natural insertion of the FCS, what do you make of the point that this\nrequires intense transmission among the intermediate host? This is what\nhappens with avian influenza to make it highly pathogenic - spread among\nthousands of birds leads to acquisition of a cleavage site. But then on the\nnatural scenario, (1) the infected hosts should be easy to find; (2) we should\nexpect many more than 1-2 spillovers.Expand full commentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nThe Lone RangerMar 28Why is all the above incompatible with forced rapid\nevolution via e.g. serial passage in humanized mice?Expand full commentReply\n(1)Share  \n---  \n  \nPhilipp Markolin, PhDProtagonist ScienceMar 28Many technical reasons. Maybe\nthe simplest: Viruses adapt to their host system. The original SARS-CoV-2\ncould not infect mice. Even with mice carrying a human copy of the ACE2\nreceptor, the virus shows none of the characteristic adaptations that it\nacquired once it learned to infect mice (alpha, delta varients) that one would\nhave expected to see earlier if it has ever been passaged in such a system.\nThe real problem is actually transmission, but that is more complex to quickly\nwrite out here.Expand full commentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nArbituramMar 28Thank you for this thorough explanation of that particular\npoint!

In the whole history of the WIV, collecting 20,000+\nsamples, they only ever managed to culture 3 sarbecoviruses. Usually it's just\nenough RNA to get a sequence but not so much that you can get yourself\nsick.There are also signs that the starting virus was already adapted to a\nrespiratory system, whereas the bat viruses are enteric viruses. The furin\ncleavage site is the most notable such feature, but there are other smaller\nones. So it was in some species other than a bat, before it jumped into\nhumans.I suppose if researchers went out sampling raccoon dogs or some other\nanimals and a researcher got sick, that could do it.

The reason to at least consider 'zoonotic\ncollection' is that we know researchers were going and continue to go collect\nsamples from remote locations where the closest known relatives to coronavirus\nexist.

Rather there was a\nwet market and a lab and a bunch of people all doing a bunch of different\nthings, etc.. Way too complex to explain. (Though because of funky math where\nwe condition on the fact that there was a pandemic, we also can't ignore that\nthere is a competition between these two factors; they just aren't the\ngenerators of reality, and therefore not of the evidence either.)It is\nextremely common to have pieces of evidence with extremely low priors, because\nthese pieces of evidence contain a lot of information about the specifics of\nthese underlying processes, and probability drops exponentially with\ninformation. Notably, contra focusing on the big picture, accurately\nintegrating this evidence requires building a narrow, specific picture of what\nhappened, because otherwise you don't really know how to evaluate the\ninteractions between the probabilities when conditioning on multiple things.As\nyou build these complex, low-probability models, that means you end up eating\na bunch of losses, in rough proportion to the evidence you add to your model\nto account for the complexity.

Assuming you're doing your Bayesian updating correctly on a good\nmodel, you should be well-calibrated, so you shouldn't be updating outside the\n0.1% to 99.9% range until you actually have a ~final conclusion. This sure\nseems like it means that strong Bayes factors should only line up for the true\nhypothesis.I think the way one gets extreme Bayes factors is model\nmisspecification. Like both hypotheses often need to eat the odds for the\ninformation contained in a piece of evidence, as they both need to be updated\nto give high probability to that information, so the low odds for the\ninformation doesn't directly give strong Bayes factors. But then the models\nshould be ready to predict similar information in the future, and if they\nconfidently disagree on what \"similar information\" means, that gives you the\ncrux for what settles the debate.But if one of the models get updated wrongly,\nfor instance by not adding a factor that explains the information, then when\nsimilar information comes around, the model that was updated wrongly gets\nforced to eat this information too, which might turn into an extreme update\nagainst it.Expand full commentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nJBGMar 28Did either side get into the US intelligence assessments at all?It\nseems to me that by far the strongest argument for lab leak is the US\ngovernment conclusions to that effect.

Like, if there were tapes of the scientists saying \"oh shit we\ndid this\" intercepted by the NSA, then all the agencies would line up behind\nthat.We also know that the FBI and DOE both think a lab leak is the\nexplanation, but according to the declassified report, they reached that\nconclusion for *different* reasons than one another. We also know that the DOE\nchanged its position between 2021 and 2023 based on some kind of new\nintelligence received in that period, whereas the FBI thought it was a lab\nleak all along.

Early on it was, back in 2019 before the PCR test\nfor it was developed and diagnosis was handled by doctors, but once public\nhealth officials got involved the definition changed to become circular: COVID\nis defined as having a positive test, a positive test is defined as having\nCOVID.This leads to all kinds of stupid stuff like the way governments\ninsisted that COVID testing had no false positives whatsoever, even when that\nclearly wasn't true. Except it kinda was true given their violent abuses of\nlogic - if the test is positive then by definition you did have COVID, even if\nyou never got sick.Due to this it's possible for the cat to both \"have COVID\"\nand also \"not have COVID\" simultaneously. We might call it COVIdinger's Cat.\nThe cat cannot actually be infected by the virus or get sick under any\nconventional understanding of disease, yet it can test positive anyway simply\ndue to having some human-generated virus particles somewhere in its body. The\nPCR tests don't care and will detect tiny quantities of fully destroyed virus,\nwhich is why they could trigger in people who'd been sick and recovered weeks\nearlier.

But the prior on an pet cat dying from it should be\nlow.Another commenter above suggested that \"maybe the cat just tested\npositive\". This is late November or early December 2019, before covid was\nknown to exist and before covid tests were invented. The only way that Connor\nhimself would even know if he had it is if he went to a hospital and they\nsaved a sample and then the hospital tested it later. Connor claims that the\nhospital called him weeks/months later and told him he tested positive, but\nthere's no other record of that. Either way, they most definitely did not save\na swab from his cat and PCR test that.The prior on a 25 year old going to the\nhospital from covid should also be pretty low. This also can't be a sampling\nbias thing, given the predicted number of covid patients at that time, there\naren't going to be many and even less are going to speak English -- even in\nthe case growth model that Rootclaim tried to present, I calculated there\nwould be at most 1 at that time)The last interesting thing is that Connor says\nthat he shopped at the market!Specifically, he wrote:\"My local paper back in\nLlandudno, North Wales, has been in touch with me. Maybe I caught the\ncoronavirus at the fish market.It\u2019s a great place to get food on a budget, a\npart of the real Wuhan that ordinary Chinese people use every day, and I\nregularly do my shopping there.Since the outbreak became international news,\nI\u2019ve seen hysterical reports (especially in the U.S. media) that exotic meats\nsuch as bat and even koala are on sale at the fish market. I\u2019ve never seen\nthat.\"So, that's not 100% explicit as to referring to Huanan market, but\nHuanan market was the one in the news, and there was a specific rumor about\nKoalas being sold at Huanan market, so it seems pretty clear that's the market\nhe's referring to.So, either:A. He's lying about the whole story and just\nfabricating it from stuff he's seen in the news.B. He's a super early patient\nwho got infected at Huanan market, and he's great evidence for the zoonosis\ntheory.C. His story is true except that he actually shopped at a different\nmarket other than Huanan, and that makes him the super secret early case that\nproves lab leak.I interpret this as most likely A. Rootclaim sees C as most\nlikely.In the third debate, I even tried to lay out a quick bayesian analysis\nfor how to decide between these options. I think that's sort of the problem\nwith Rootclaim's method -- they decided from a high level view that they think\nthat lab leak is true, then they went looking for evidence to confirm that\nview, with no good filter on what evidence should be trusted, i.e. they\ndecided that the cases in the WHO report are 100% fraudulent but Connor Reed's\ncase is 100% likely to be covid.

(Lots of cat diseases to go around,\nunfortunately.) This is a major source of kitten mortality in litters, pounds\n(so notorious as to have their own names like 'kennel flu'), and cat colonies,\nor cats in general, and there is nothing all that odd about it happening or a\nkitten dying of it; and it dying is that much more likely if not treated\n(which it apparently wasn't inasmuch as Connor was busy being sick and being\nan expat probably couldn't call on anyone for a local vet).

The people who have\ndied must have had underlying health problems\", which is a weird description\nfor hospitalized for 2 weeks.I suppose you can't entirely determine whether\nConnor's story is inconsistent or this is bad reporting.Same with \"the feline\ncoronavirus\". How would he know what the cat had? He says he was housebound,\nwasn't going to the vet. I'm not sure the usual timeline for FIPV. In the\nDailymail, he's asking if the cat got the \"flu\" he had. Then in the Wales\nonline article, he's saying he's not sure if he caught it from the cat. But if\nhe's certain it was \"the feline coronavirus\", that doesn't even infect people,\nright?The path to this all being important requires both that \"Connor is\ntrustworthy\" and also \"Connor is lying about shopping at Huanan\" (or else I\nmisinterpreted which market he was talking about) and \"We've settled on a\nspecific growth rate for the market outbreak\" for which this evidence would\ncontradict and it's somewhat dependent on \"Connor got covid on Nov 25th, not\nduring his second wave of illness in early Dec\".I think I'm very likely to win\neither \"Connor is untrustworthy\", with \"Connor shopped at Huanan\" as a\nbackup.With a certain motivated reasoning, though, you can conclude that\nConnor is great evidence to contradict zoonosis at the market, and therefore\n\"SMOKING GUN FOR LAB LEAK!\"I also think I have a strong enough model, between\ncase growth rates, genetic diversity, Wuhan serology, etc, to simply put low\nprior odds on dubious covid infections in November as being likely to be\ntrue.Likewise, if Connor really got sick in November, where are the interviews\nwith 100+ Chinese people that also did, that you would statistically expect?\nThere are interviews available with some of the earliest people sick at the\nmarket. Did China somehow retroactively censor every other similar account\nfrom before?It's the same thing with e.g. positive covid tests in Italy in\nSeptember. I did a laborious deep dive through all those papers just in case\nSaar brought them up, but you can also determine they're unlikely to be valid\nif you have a good enough understanding of the other evidence.In a larger\nsense, I think there's a certain personality type that gets drawn to the\npatterns and another that gets fixated on outliers. This dynamic even created\na new theory, at the\ndebate:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u_Ne53YLJuSPm75jjCRkeQJHGvpRogor/view?usp=sharingI\nwrote some code to model and graph mutations that were reversions. There were\n2 dots out of place in my graph. I sort of noticed when making it, but it\ndidn't really register in my brain as that important.Saar noticed the dots\nlater and concluded they were \"SMOKING GUN FOR LAB LEAK!\" and they coincided\nwith SMOKING GUN DELETED EARLY CASES and SMOKING GUN ANTARCTICA SOIL SAMPLES\n(which both also turn out to be misleading and unimportant claims under\nfurther investigation).So I dug into the code and the data to figure out why\nmy diagram didn't match Pekar's, and found it was a mundane explanation for\nthe 2 dots and corrected the diagram.Once you've been through this process\ndozens of times with the lab leak crew, you kind of develop an understanding\nthat they're just throwing out one bad claim after another, and those rarely\never hold up.I think this is actually a great heuristic, that's better than\nbayesian reasoning, for spotting conspiracy theories.One of the first places I\nmight have developed this approach was in 2020, when I was trying to figure\nout if the election was stolen, i.e. for curiosity and to know who to bet on\nin the political betting markets.The 2020 election fraud people made a lot of\nclaims that the election was stolen. People who doubted it asked \"where is the\nevidence?\"So someone made a site called \"here is the\nevidence\"https://hereistheevidence.com/It looks like it currently has 1,687\nclaims as to why the 2020 election was stolen.My process, back in 2020, was to\ngo through maybe 20-30 election fraud claims and evaluate them. Every single\none I evaluated was either clearly false or just ambiguous and misleading. So\nI concluded that I did not have to read a list of 1,000 and I bet that Biden\nwould still win (I forget the rules of the market, perhaps I was still taking\na risk on a successful coup).It's kind of similar with lab leak -- I've\nevaluated hundreds of claims now and found the vast majority either blatantly\nor subtly wrong. Had any of them been convincing, I would have dropped out\nprior to the debate and moderated my stance on covid origins, maybe even\nflipped it. Saar credulously relied on many of them in the debate, many more\ntransparently false than Connor Reed's covid case.From Saar's probabilistic\nperspective, it's more like: the details for Connor don't even matter. Even if\nConnor didn't have covid, someone else did, and if he dug hard enough, he's\nsure he could find that person. And because he thinks that, you can't apply\nhigh odds to the market outbreak. In fact, he thinks you can't apply any odds\nat all to it, he thinks all existing case data is bayes factor 1 between\nmarket and lab.I think Saar has concluded that lab leak is almost certainly\ntrue based on the location in Wuhan and the furin cleavage site. Therefore,\nlots of non-market early cases must exist somewhere, and he doesn't even have\nto look.If someone made \"here is the lab leak evidence dot com\", with 1,700\ndifferent examples of early cases, I would go through 100 and notice that 95\nare clearly wrong and 5 are ambiguous and whoever curated the site is probably\njust not very careful.Saar would look at the list and say, \"wow, that's 1,700\ndifferent claims. If even one of them is correct, then it's surely a lab leak!\nWhat are the odds that 1,700 claims are all wrong?\"I could be wrong about all\nthis, of course.

I think that was just coincidence.\"That is, he is\nexplicitly saying his kitten caught and died of FCoV and *not* COVID-19, and\nhe is denying any suggestions that his mystery sickness might've been some\nnon-COVID-19 caught from her (which is probably right, I've never come across\nanything about FCoV infecting humans).> Same with \"the feline coronavirus\".\nHow would he know what the cat had?He knew it had 'feline coronavirus' (FCoV)\nfor the reasons I knew that the kitten probably died of perfectly ordinary\nFCoV/FIP before I ever saw this additional article: because that kills a huge\nnumber of healthy kittens with exactly the described symptoms and often quite\nrapidly once they become visibly sick with respiratory symptoms. (I would not\nbe surprised if the reason he was firmer and more precise in his second claim\nis because he had time to look up more information on FCoV or someone read his\nDaily Mail comments and told him that it was definitely FCoV.)On a side note,\nScott, the whole drug approval situation for FIP is interesting and might be\nworth a post: https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/05/remdesivir-\ncats/611341/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GS-441524\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feline_infectious_peritonitis> He says he was\nhousebound, wasn't going to the vet. I'm not sure the usual timeline for\nFIPV.The usual timeline is days to weeks for a large fraction of cats for the\nwet form. In other words, exactly what he reported.> In the Dailymail, he's\nasking if the cat got the \"flu\" he had.Which is a reasonable question to ask\nin a diary entry while delirious and sick and ignorant of veterinary medicine.\n(Because if he had COVID-19, she absolutely could have gotten it, as we now\nknow, but she probably didn't because she died so it was far more likely to be\nFCoV.)> Then in the Wales online article, he's saying he's not sure if he\ncaught it from the cat. But if he's certain it was \"the feline coronavirus\",\nthat doesn't even infect people, right?Er, no, that's not what he said? He\nsays the exact opposite. He says he *didn't* catch it from her: \"I don't think\nI caught it from her.\"So let me ask again: you have repeatedly said that\nConnor said COVID-19 killed his cat.

(I like cats, so I didn't mind the prospect of reading more about cats &\nCOVID.) I started with his first slide point which Scott has mis-paraphrased\nand so could be regarded as a quasi-random choice on my part: \"Claims his cat\ndied from covid\". Quotes are some of the easiest things there are to use and\nto factcheck, and so good for epistemic spotchecks of miscitations.\n('Miscitation' is common https://gwern.net/leprechaun#miscitation ,\nunsurprisingly usually favors the thesis of the misciter, highly skewed in\nspecific papers https://twitter.com/ianhussey/status/1641745134495596547\nhttps://twitter.com/ianhussey/status/1641745136785805314 with papers ranging\nas high as 50% false descriptions of all cited sources, and in my experience\nmiscitation is a red flag for bad research. So miscitation research tends to\njustify the old saw _falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus_.)This turns out to take\nall of 15s to fact-check: hotkey to Google 'connor covid cat daily mail', open\nhit #1 \"First British victim, 25, describes coronavirus\"\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8075633/First-British-\nvictim-25-describes-coronavirus.html , C-f ' cat ', and the first hit is an\nimage caption quoting Connor, \"Pictured: Connor and the cat that hangs around\nhis apartment in Wuhan, China. Suddenly, I\u2019m feeling better, physically at\nleast. The flu has lifted. But the poor kitten has died. I don\u2019t know whether\nit had what I\u2019ve got, or whether cats can even get human flu. I feel\nmiserable\". This obviously does not support, or outright contradicts, Peter's\nclaim and is an immediate red flag. Perhaps the rest of the article...? No.\nThe 'day 11' quote is the same, and further reading just shows a sentence or\ntwo about how the kitten died of what sounds like a classic FCoV infection\n(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feline_coronavirus) and has the usual terminal\noutcome.Perhaps Peter has some *other* source where Connor changes his mind\nlater on and is now claiming that cats definitely can get 'human flu' and his\nkitten definitely did die of it? No, in the Wales article (not findable via\n'connor covid cat' but hit ~#5 for 'connor reed covid cat'), he says\nspecifically that it was \"feline coronavirus\" (FCoV). OK, it's not looking\ngood... So let's ask Peter. This is a dead simple question that he should have\nin his notes, at least, if not his slides.And... you can see the results in\nthis thread. Thousands of words about everything *but* how he interprets \"I\ndon\u2019t know whether it had what I\u2019ve got\" or \"My kitten caught the feline\ncoronavirus and developed pneumonia and died\" and turns that into his\nassertion that Connor \"Claims his cat died from covid\" & this helps discredit\nConnor. Obviously Peter just screwed it up and it was convenient for his case\nso he never double-checked. Either he was in too much of a rush to actually\nread the Daily Mail article or he did actually read that Wales article but he\ndidn't know what FCoV is or bothered to look up the phrase and so just\n*assumed* that 'feline coronavirus' must have meant 'COVID-19 but in a cat'.\n(It's actually quite funny how many words and how many other topics get\ndragged in to not respond to such a simple question - where it would've been\nso much easier to just say \"hm yeah I guess I misread it in my rush since it\nwas, after all, such a minor point in a big complicated debate. It happens. My\nbad! I'll correct that if it ever comes up again.\")So: 1/1 epistemic\nspotchecks failed.\\---I think this is good to know, not because Peter should\nbe embarrassed. He shouldn't be, IMO. Peter's job here was not to tell the\ntruth about Connor, so it's not a problem that he didn't. His job was to make\nwhatever mouth-noises convinced the judges to give him $100,000. He has\nsucceeded splendidly at this. Congratulations! (To put it another way, Peter\nhas now earned approximately $99,000 more from 'arguing online' than I ever\nhave.) If anything, his victory is *more* impressive if he's making basic\nmiscitations and no one notices until long afterwards.The people who should be\nembarrassed here are not Peter, but *his opponents* and the judges. The point\nof an adversarial format is that your opponents are supposed to keep you\nhonest. Checking Peter's citations is about the very least critical\nexamination one could do. It takes literally ~15s to check his cat claim, and\nrequires no scientific knowledge or skills beyond elementary school-level\nEnglish literacy. And yet, Saar and his team could not do that (and neither\ndid the judges, despite being paid a substantial amount of money to judge).Did\nthey lack adequate incentive? Apparently, whatever that is, '$100,000' is\nstill not enough incentive. If $100,000 doesn't pay for a few seconds checking\nthe top-level slide claims like \"*did* Connor claim his cat died from COVID?\",\nI don't know how much money it would take to incentivize checking Peter's\nclaims to a level that, say, a newspaper would not be embarrassed by. And this\nis the simplest, easiest possible type of claim to check; claims about all the\n*other* stuff like software bugs or mahjong parlor locations or state-level\ncensorship operations...So what I've learned from this is that the Rootclaims\nadversarial debate format is not fit for its purpose, and has blatantly failed\nto incentivize adequate criticism of positions.\\---Can this be fixed?\nHonestly, I am pretty negative about adversarial debate formats in general,\nregardless of Bayesian gloss. Even excluding the pathological instances like\n'debate clubs', 'debate' does not have a good historical track record. You\nknow what sorts of organizations are really fond of debates? Ones like the\nmedieval Catholic Church and contemporary Creationists. We don't do science by\ndebate formats. (I am also pretty down on approaches to AI safety involving\n'debate', although at least there you have the benefit of being able to\n*force* AI agents to spend arbitrary amounts of time examining every part of a\ndebate tree.)If Rootclaim wants to continue experimenting with this mechanism,\ninstead of considering alternatives with better chances of success like\n(either adversarial or cooperative) prediction markets or (cooperative) Delphi\npanels, I have two suggestions for them:1\\. refocus on questions that will be\ndefinitively known in the short-term. As matters stand, Rootclaim seems to be\nobsessed with failing to create a track record. 'Did Putin have cancer?' 'Was\nCOVID a lab leak?' Come on. You may never get a definitive answer to these.\nAnd if you look at what they consider a 'track record'\nhttps://www.rootclaim.com/rootclaim-track-record , it's stuff like \"was XYZ\nmurdered like we concluded after all? well, later on it turned out someone has\na surveillance tape of a guy sitting in a car! Case closed.\"2\\. adopt a more\ntruly adversarial attitude towards the intellectual redteaming. For example,\nadd a simple attention check, like requiring the judges to add a randomized\nnumber of deliberate errors to both sides in a debate; report how many were\nfound by the adversaries at the end with the verdict. (For a debate this size,\nI think around a dozen would be adequate.) I predict that most of the errors\nwill not be found, and this will, correctly, cast considerable doubt on the\nevidential value of the debate: if the debators cannot find the deliberate\nerrors reliably, why do you think they can find any of the debators' self-\nbiased errors adversarially chosen to fool listeners, or the underlying errors\nin the original sources, or that the final verdict based on all this would be\nreliable? For an even more rigorous debate format, one could add a requirement\nabout passing the attention check: if the winner doesn't find at least half of\nthe errors added to their adversary's case, they forfeit either their winnings\nor their winnings & their stake to charity. (Otherwise, one has no incentive\nto check any more carefully than seems necessary to beat an incompetent\nopponent and will loaf.)Expand full commentReply (3)Share  \n---  \n  \ntgof137Heterodox HeresyMar 28Alright, here's where I first made the claims in\nweek 1:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1vaooTKHCM#t=1h10m30sHere's where Saar\nbrought up the discussion again in week\n3:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWMmj8ZprnI#t=55m30sAt 57 minutes, Saar\ninfers that it was not Huanan market.It is ambiguous, Connor just says \"the\nfish market\".

For one\nthing, there's no actual verification that he was sick with COVID during that\ntimeframe in the first place, which is why he was not included in the official\ncases in spite of all these media stories. Other people have claimed to be\nunconfirmed early cases such as athletes attending the Wuhan Military Games in\nOctober, but these are generally believed to be cases of misidentification.In\nhis story Connor Reed says he might have been infected at \"the fish market\"\nthat was written about in the Western media, where bats and koalas were\nallegedly sold. This only describes one market in Wuhan, the Huanan Seafood\nMarket, where news sites incorrectly reported the sale of koalas (it ended up\nbeing a mistranslation of another\nspecies).https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/food-market-at-centre-of-deadly-\ncoronavirus-outbreak-admits-selling-live-koalas-snakes-rats-and-\nwolves/WMMILWGWLTKZVLSK5VK6W5H7G4/https://mothership.sg/2020/01/wild-animal-\nwuhan-market/So if we take him at his word, Connor Reed may actually be\nbacking up the market origin, although it's strange that he seems to not know\nthe name of the market itself. He apparently lives some distance from the\nHuanan Market. All the details in his story could be picked out of media\nreports.There was a wave of influenza going through Wuhan at the time so it\nseems possible that he just had a bad case of flu and confused it with\nCOVID-19 (although he claims to have been tested).

The participants largely seem to agree on what\nthe site *is* but disagree on whether or not the site is more likely to be of\nnatural evolution or a man-made insertion.For DEFUSE, yes to some extent Peter\nis taking WIV at their word. But he also points out several reasons why it\u2019s\nactually likely that they weren\u2019t doing the right type of experiments on the\nright strain to cause the epidemic. And why if they were doing those\nexperiments, it\u2019s likely they would have said so (since before the epidemic\nthey had no reason to cover up).Meanwhile Saar\u2019s theory *depends on* WIV / CCP\nlying about what they did after not getting the DEFUSE grant. And he doesn\u2019t\nactually have any proof that they did, he\u2019s just inferring that they did from\nhis conclusion that the furin cleavage sites were probably man-made. His\nargument also relies on either WIV/CCP pre-emptively covering up their\nactivities that eventually caused COVID (while being open about their other\nresearch and desire to be involved in gain-of-function studies) OR this\nresearch occurring at exactly the right time that it had gotten done but not\npublished before the virus leaked and they went into cover-up mode.Conditional\non this being an unintentional lab leak, yes it\u2019s very likely it would occur\nin Wuhan vs. somewhere else. Conditional on it being zoonotic, there\u2019s not\nreally any reason it would be in Wuhan vs some other Chinese city (but no\nparticular reason it wouldn\u2019t be in Wuhan). How much you weight you put on\nthat \u201ccoincidence\u201d will largely be swamped by how likely you consider zoonotic\ntransmission and lab leaks in the first place (which is really hard to sus\nout, since both are rare).Expand full commentReply (1)Share  \n---  \n  \nThe Lone RangerMar 28We can be reasonably sure the WIV/CCP are lying about\nsomething, because they have stonewalled or misdirected all attempts at\ninvestigation, taken virus databases offline in the middle of the night,\ndisappeared people involved and done various other highly suspicious things,\nsome of which are known only via intel leaks from western intelligence\nagencies.The debate here didn't touch on most of the evidence, but for example\nthe US Government has claimed that they intercepted messages in November\ntalking about a very severe situation at the WIV, and there is evidence they\nwas a sharp uptick in activity there (hacked mobile phone records), and that\nthey were rapidly acquiring \"air incinerators\" and other things. Air\nincinerators would imply they suspected or found a leak in the lab's air ducts\nor air handling equipment. It's been a while since I last looked at this but\nthe weight of evidence for something having gone wrong at the lab is very\nhigh, unless you assume the leaks are all invalid (which would lead to a\nquestion of motive, as the establishment is very keen on zoonosis as a\ntheory).I do not buy the idea that it's unlikely they were doing such\nexperiments:1\\. It's very likely that the PLA were involved or at least\nmonitoring the research going on there. All this stuff is highly tied up with\nmilitary research, hence why DEFUSE was submitted to DARPA in the first place.\nThus we can't assume everything would have been made public.2\\. Peter argues\nthe WIV would have been totally open and transparent before COVID, even though\nthey became immediately 100% opaque afterwards and that has never changed\nsince. If they're so innocent, why the sudden switch? More plausible: they\nhave something to hide and thus were plausibly also previously hiding\nsomething.3\\. I don't think WIV/CCP have ever commented on the DEFUSE grant or\nwhether the WIV did or did not do the suggested research, did they?4\\. The\nresearch occurring at the time of a leak and before it got published, assuming\nit was destined to be published at all, seems very plausible, no?5\\. The \"FCS\nis natural\" argument makes some bold assumptions about the nature of whatever\nwas being done, why and what could or could not have happened in a lab. I\ndon't buy it. We know virologists love to play games with accelerating\nevolution, so what a geneticist might or might not have done to add an FCS\ndoesn't seem very relevant to what WIV researchers would have done.6\\. Lab\nleaks aren't particularly rare. They happen quite frequently, especially if\nyou consider accidents that are bad but don't manage to start pandemics.Expand\nfull commentReply (2)Share  \n---  \n  \nGbdubMar 28Again, your entire argument here is that there is a cover-up that\nis effective enough to make zoonotic origin plausible enough to convince a lot\nof smart people who\u2019ve looked deeply into it, but not so good that Saar et al\ncouldn\u2019t prove it to be false. That\u2019s a fine line! Meanwhile you expect Peter\nto prove a negative (CCP didn\u2019t lie in precisely that way).I would also\nreiterate: a wet market outbreak still looks very bad for China, and we can\nsee that the Party line is that *neither* theory is true. Why would the CCP\nstage an elaborate cover up that still paints them in a bad light, vs. cooking\nup some evidence that it was from a Sri Lankan tourist or whatever?I don\u2019t\nhave infinite time but I\u2019ll address two points where I think you\u2019re being\nuncharitable to Peter\u2019s argument.2\\. Peter is not saying the WIV is \u201cperfectly\ntransparent\u201d. He is however saying they were open about their research, and\nuntil the leak of Covid would have had no reason to cover up specifically the\nline of research and exact strain that would later lead to an outbreak,\nbecause they would have had no way to know beforehand that that strain and\nthat research was the one that would leak.Unless you believe it was a\ndeliberate bioweapon, in which case you\u2019d sort of expect them to be completely\nopaque rather than \u201cvery open and then opaque only after a possible screw\nup\u201d.The WIV going full CYA mode strikes me as likely whether or not they were\nat fault.

I have to admit,\nmy biggest surprise when I started reading this article was that there was\nsomeone smart who was willing to argue against the lab leak. I know a lot of\nsmart people and not one believes in it was a natural event. And as Scott\nshows at the start, the vast majority of all people don't believe that either.\nPeter is certainly being very counter-cultural. And if you want to argue that\n\"smart people\" are in the minority, well that's an appeal to authority that\nacademics no longer have.Putting that aside, I don't think Saar retreated at\nall. Let's assume both argue in good faith, and I think Peter did even though\nI think he's wrong. Remember that language is very imprecise. This imprecision\nhas already created a ton of confusion on this topic for several years\nalready. If the WIV do something to speed up the natural rate of evolution, is\nthat \"natural\"? Is it \"engineering\"? That's entirely subjective and you could\neasily argue for both words. Peter here starts by assuming that not natural\nmeans genetically engineered and then starts arguing against it being\ngenetically engineered, which isn't a correct assumption given the nature of\nthe WIV's investigation. They were interested in what a coronavirus pandemic\nmight look like. They wanted to look into the future (at least, officially).\nJust directly engineering an FCS into a pre-existing virus can't possibly tell\nthem that, so why would they have done so? Rapid forced evolution in humanized\norganisms on the other hand are a much closer way to \"speed up time\", and\ncould easily have led to the evolution of a strange FCS under lab conditions.\nIf they didn't expect it to happen because it's never known to have happened\nin nature before then they would not have been taking the necessary\nprecautions, as indeed we know they were not. And bang, that's all it takes to\nstart a pandemic for real.So Saar didn't shift at all, in my perspective. He\ncorrected a misunderstanding by Peter of what was being actually argued, an\nhonest misunderstanding coming from the vagueness of terms like \"natural\" when\ntalking about serial passaging experiments. But it does invalidate most of\nPeter's arguments about the exact genetic code of the FCS.Expand full\ncommentReply (1)Share  \n---  \n  \nGbdubMar 28Peter won the debate and convinced Scott, and Peter\u2019s evidence\nseems to be reliant on a growing body of recent research and expert opinion\nshifting back toward zoonosis. Anyway, ignore my throwaway line, point was\nthis would need to be a very good but not perfect cover up, and a cover up\nthat still leaves the CCP looking bad, which is weird.I have to disagree with\nthe rest of your assessment. The initial argument was that the 12 nucleotide\nmutation, and inclusion of a sequence similar to a human sequence was too\nunlikely, too \u201cout of nowhere\u201d, to be natural in origin.\u201cIt looks natural, but\nthat\u2019s because it was intentionally designed to look natural and/or it was\nmutated in a lab by manipulating natural processes\u201d is a plausible argument,\nbut it\u2019s incompatible with the first argument.If you concede the second\nargument, that preserves the possibility that the virus was lab-made, but it\nmust reduce the probability that it is lab-made, because you\u2019re conceding that\nthe virus is no longer obviously distinct from a naturally mutated zoonotic\nvirus.Expand full commentReply (1)Share  \n---  \n  \nThe Lone RangerMar 28\u00b7edited Mar 28I dunno, \"good but not perfect\" sums up a\nlot of things? By definition we don't know about the perfect conspiracies. I\nmean, you're arguing these are smart people, so surely \"good but not perfect\"\nis about what we'd expect.> is a plausible argument, but it\u2019s incompatible\nwith the first argument.I don't quite follow why it's incompatible, sorry.\nIsn't it the same? Are we getting hung up on the definition of natural? The\nmutation being too unlikely and \"out of nowhere\" to be natural would be\ncorrect, if the only way to get it were to artificially speed up evolution in\na lab. When we say \"natural\" we mean in the absence of human help. Something\ncan be both ~impossible to occur truly naturally, and also the result of\n\"natural\" processes that have been tweaked or tampered with. No virus in the\nwild is going to spend lots of time inside genetically engineered mice that\nhave ACE2 receptors, which is what the WIV was doing. In this sense it isn't\nnatural. On the other hand, if you force evolution to occur in weird animals\nbred to resemble humans then the results are going to look a bit like it could\nhave been natural. That's why other evidence has to be taken into account\ntoo.The virus is distinct from all known naturally mutated coronaviruses - it\nappears already well adapted to humans (serial passage through humanized mice\nwill do that), it has an apparently evolved furin cleavage site (not observed\nin nature in this type of virus), and it appeared spontaneously in the middle\nof a city rather than near large animal reservoirs as is typical for other\ncrossovers. It's also not influenza which was the previously anticipated cause\nof a global pandemic. All of these things are highly compatible with the type\nof experiments the WIV were known to be proposing and doing.Expand full\ncommentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \neverythingismMar 31\u00b7edited Mar 31You are missing some important context which\nis that many of the allegations you mentioned (about a \"severe situation\" at\nWIV for instance) seem to be exaggerated or made\nup.https://fallows.substack.com/p/on-that-propublica-chinese-lab-leakThe\n\"severe situation\" story by Katherine Eban and Propublica seems to be based on\na bad translation, with China experts questioning it and Propublica eventually\nissuing an update on the article itself. And there are a number of stories\nabout the lab like this that end up being the result of bad reporting,\nmisinterpreted evidence etc.When you look into who is behind these stories\nmany of them seem to be coming from the Trump State Department under Mike\nPompeo, which conducted an investigation into the lab back in 2020. \"State\nDepartment investigators\" is the source given for many of the key lab leak\nstories, such as the claims about sick scientists with COVID symptoms\npublished by Michael Shellenberger and the Wall Street Journal or the Sunday\nTimes story including the claim that a Chinese scientist might have been\nexecuted by being thrown off the roof of the lab.There's actually an account\nby another State Department official who was involved in the investigation\nabout what happened:https://christopherashleyford.medium.com/the-lab-leak-\ninquiry-at-the-state-department-96973cff3a65He says he was open to the lab\nleak but that certain officials like David Asher and Miles Yu became very\nfanatical about it. According to him they were already believing unhinged\nconspiracy theories like the virus being a racially targeted bioweapon and\nwanted to charge China under the Biological Weapons Convention, which he\nthought was a bad idea. Eventually they ended up accusing him of being part of\nthe conspiracy and trying to cover up their work. The same people, along with\nTrump, Pompeo and Richard Dearlove, the former head of MI6, appeared in Sherri\nMarkson's documentary \"What Really Happened in Wuhan.\"There's some interesting\nbackground to all this which is that both Miles Yu and Mike Pompeo have\nconnections to the New Federal State of China, a weird regime change group\nthat says it wants to overthrow the Chinese government. This group was the\nfirst to promote the lab leak theory in a major way starting all the way back\nin mid January\n2020.https://twitter.com/wanderer_jasnah/status/1631438683688648705https://mediamanipulation.org/case-\nstudies/cloaked-science-yan-\nreportshttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/20/business/media/steve-bannon-\nchina.htmlMike Pompeo received an award from the group and Miles Yu has spoken\nglowingly of its founder Guo Wengui, who is now facing trial for defrauding\nthe overseas Chinese community out of $1 billion, in speeches he's given. So\nit seems quite possible this group and others in the anti-CCP Chinese diaspora\nare influencing the lab leak narrative to some\nextent.https://twitter.com/dfriedman33/status/1631346935905886224https://twitter.com/mrspanstreppon/status/1745855771005317279https://twitter.com/gujingc/status/1707281401857663145Only\nproblem is that when the ODNI issued a report on the lab last year, it seemed\nto greatly downplay the significance of many of these allegations. Turns out\nthere was no specific biosafety incident known about, the people at the lab\nwho got sick probably just had normal seasonal illness and there was no\nindication they were the ones working on coronavirus research (discussed\ntowards the end of this article).https://archive.is/BEwU2All of this therefore\nneeds to obviously be taken with a lot of skepticism.

Quant traders / financial people in\ngeneral are one of the most calibrated and truth tracking professions.2\\.\nBasically all traders, after accounting for fees, risk, and long run\nperformance, underperform the index.Which seems contradictory. However, there\nare obvious ways in which these claims can be both true.1\\. We're talking\nabout different populationsA. People talking online are highly selected by the\ncompetence of their peers, so all the anecdotes online are selecting for say,\nthe top1% of traders.B. There are two criteria for success, marketing and\nactual financial talent. Funds that are mostly good at selling a story to\nretail investors \"drag down\" the average, but remain solvent because their\ncustomers do not understand \"underperforming the index\". Calibrated people\ncome from the latter, or produce models for the former that are then\norganizationally neutered in some way.C. This is just talking about two time\nperiods. Kahneman released his analysis something like 20 years ago, and most\nof what I read about this was from that timeframe. 20 years is a very long\ntime for a bunch of intelligent people to incorporate new information and\ndevelop good norms around them.2\\. The second situation is that one of the\npremises above is flawed.A. Individual models do perform better or worse, but\nthey do so for significantly short periods of time, or the models themselves\nare calibrated, but the financial EVs aren't, so you end up with something\nlike a black schols situation, where most calibrated models do well, then\nsomeone accidentally has a programming error flipping a sign, or something\nwhich wipes out a lot of value, and these unlikely incidents form a balancing\nfactor for performance. So calibration does not necessarily track financial\nperformance.D. The \"fees\" part of the \"outperforming the index fund\" is where\nall the magic happens: the individual trader or firm wins by having good\nmodels, but they aren't good enough for the retail investor. So calibration\ndoes track financial performance, just not enough.Hmm, maybe ai should talk to\nfinance people more.Expand full commentReply (3)Share  \n---  \n  \n1123581321Mar 28\"All traders\", taken literally, are the index, and therefore\nmust underperform due to various frictions.Expand full commentReply (1)Share  \n---  \n  \nMicaiahCMar 28That's not it, I don't think, since the index is a specific\nalgorithm weighting everything and \"all traders\" here specifically mean \"like\n200 firms that Kahneman looked at in Wall Street\" or something like that.I'm\nnot sure if that's definitionally true or false, it is the case that every\ntrade has a buyer and a seller, but I have an intuition that at least some\nmovement of the stock market reflects \"real underlying wealth\" whatever that\nmeans, and that it would be possible to have economic growth such that indexes\nin fact do not perform well.

And\nit wasn't detected, because until special tests were developed, COVID just\nlooked like \"atypical pneumonia\". That is where it adapted to humans.

But if I am correct, our knowledge\nof what viruses are circulating where is quite patchy and incomplete.

So perhaps they just haven't been looking in the\nproper caves to find a closer example.FWIW, I don't think the evidence is\nsufficient to invest ANY of the theories assigning blame with much belief.\nPeople can't even agree on what was the most probable non-human host. (Why not\nsome weasel...we know it spread well among mink.)Expand full commentReply\n(1)Share  \n---  \n  \neverythingismMar 31The main challenge to this idea would probably be the fact\nthat the pandemic seems to be descended from the strain of the virus that\nemerged in Wuhan, with scientists arguing it traces back in terms of timing to\nlate November, right around the time the Huanan Market outbreak would have\nbegun. This is why the scenario of spillover at the market seems to make\nsense, especially given there were multiple potential host species sold and\nslaughtered there. As it happens one of the stores at the market had a website\nthat was archived on the Wayback Machine and you can get an idea of the range\nof species that were being\nsold:https://web.archive.org/web/20190707014745/http://whdaz.com/Some of the\nanimals were being imported from the part of China where similar viruses\ncirculate in bats, while others are the same species found infected during\nSARS-CoV-1.But all of that could be wrong of course. Apparently there was a\nwave of influenza spreading through Hubei province right before the pandemic\nbegan so you could speculate that this masked smaller-scale rural outbreaks.\nThere's never been retrospective case-finding outside of Wuhan that's been\npublicly released. There's a report in a Hubei paper that markets in Enshi,\nwhere civets and raccoon dogs sold in Wuhan were raised, were shut down on\nDecember 23, 2019 -- a week before the Huanan Market in Wuhan was\nclosed.https://www.independent.co.uk/asia/china/covid-coronavirus-bats-caves-\nhubei-b1940443.htmlChina has also failed to release testing of blood banks\noutside of Wuhan, and testing of the animal trade in general has been limited.\nOfficially the government still claims that zero animals within their borders\nhave tested positive at any point during the pandemic and there have been no\noutbreaks on fur farms in spite of tens of millions of susceptible species\nbeing raised there. So it's difficult to draw conclusions but the genetic\nhistory seems to point to the outbreak in Wuhan being caused by spillover to\nhumans either at the market itself, or at a closely linked location such as a\nfarm that supplied the market.Expand full commentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nKenny EaswaranMar 28Is 1000 miles nearer or farther than you expect for a\nvirus that is separated by several years or decades of evolution from the\nvirus we're talking about?Expand full commentReply (1)Share  \n---  \n  \nMr. DoolittleApr 2According to Saar's argument, which Peter did not refute,\nthe nearest example we've found was located 1,000 miles away.

Yet we are usually able to\nupdate our beliefs and correct course by ourselves when such opportunities\npresent themselves, while conspiracy theorists usually can not. The term\n\"conspiracy theorist\" should - in my opinion - be reserved for the accurate\ndescription of participants and activists in closely-knit conspiratorial\ncommunities that are hyper-engaged and trapped in these all-encompassing\nworldviews, even victims of it. They need help and deprogramming; they do not\ndeserve our attention, but also not our scorn.

Self-serving influencers, populist commentators, unethical\njournalists, calculating politicians, fanatic activists, power brokers, media\nmanipulators, conflict entrepreneurs, contrarian grifters, and their ilk would\nprobably fall into that group.

This is definitely very\ninteresting.I find myself walking away with a couple of thoughts. First, about\nthe debate itself:1) I started out pretty strongly leaning towards but far\nfrom certain about Lab Leak being correct. A lot of this I think stems from\nfinding out that the anti-lab-leak side was a literal conspiracy that had a\nlot of institutional support to try to shut down the debate. Even those\nshouting down the theory secretly thought it might be true (at least early\non)!2) Likely related, I could feel learned helplessness setting in while\nreading the back and forth descriptions of the debate. With no priors on the\nbelievability of either participant, and seeing that both were making very\nstrong claims that could reasonably answer their opponents, I want to mentally\nshut down and hold my existing perspective.3) I end the debate slightly closer\nto zoonosis/no opinion, but still leaning towards lab leak.Meta-discussion I\nfeel much worse about Bayesian reasoning, especially the hard version with\nmath. Peter clearly has a number that's beyond implausible, but the error bars\non all of the numbers seem unworkably large. You could adjust all of the\nfactors up and down by relatively small amounts and come up with any\ninterpretation.Even more, sometimes really really implausible things happen.\nAs Scott notes here, something really implausible definitely did happen! In\nfact, across the world, implausible things happen quite often. People die of\nincredibly unlikely events all the time - an average of about 7 kids per year\nin the US have drowned in buckets since 1984. If you had never heard that\nnumber, what probability would you put on the chances of a child drowning in a\nbucket? There are 22.4 million kids 0-5 in the US right now, with seven per\nyear drowning in a bucket, which suggests about 0.0000003125 chance of a child\ndrowning in a bucket in a given year. No matter how you do the math, the\nchances are very truly low. But it happens seven times a year.How would we\nmodel COVID's origins if something incredibly unlikely happened? It's not\nimpossible that it originated in neither the Wuhan Institute nor the wet\nmarket. In the realm of possible, it may not even have started in Wuhan.\nSaying that something is *more* or *less* likely is all well and good, but\nreality happens in exactly one way, which can be the very rare event. I think\n1/10,000 is incorrect for the likelihood here, but sometimes 1/10,000 things\nhappen. Just because we say something is unlikely doesn't mean it's untrue.\nSaar implicitly believes that the wet market theory is ~6% likely to be true.\n6% is far from ruling something out, even if he's arguing as if it's closer to\n99.99% the other way.Expand full commentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nConnGatorMar 28Interesting debate, well covered.I updated my lab leak\nconfidence from 99% to 90%.

College debate has this concept of dropped arguments, where the worst\nthing you can do is not respond to a specific argument your opponent makes,\nbecause they automatically win that argument. That's what this felt like, I'm\nnot actually convinced by Peter's overall story, I'm not even sure there's a\ncoherent story there, but Peter kept coming up with specific situations where\nSaar was wrong and that convinced me.I'm reading back through the lineages\nthing and, just reading through, Peters positive argument for why the older\nlineage started spreading later is pretty handwavy. Compare that to the next\nsection where he goes through why the intermediates are a programming error,\nhe's on point. But I come back to the core question of why the older lineage\nstarted spreading later than the new lineage and I don't have a great answer\nto the main point, and I think Saar's is better here, but Peter dominates on\nthe subpoint.I'm just scared of focusing too much on the subpoint and\nirrationally weighing that too heavily.

To elaborate a bit - and to\nintegrate over a few strands of ~independent evidence:a) We have two lineages,\nLineage A appears (with v. high probability) older, and the wet market cases\nare lineage B (and iirc, no original Lineage A cases at all).b) We have other\nrelatively early cases that don't have a known market linkc) None of the early\nwet market cases look remotely like Patient Zero smoking guns (none of the\nanimal trade workers, no infected animals detected at the market etc).d) We\nsee superspreading events at other wet/seafood markets in other\ncities/countries.These fit quite well with a story of \"the outbreak starts at\nunknown location, the first detected cases we see at the wet market are\nseveral generations in [something that in the abstract is pretty likely - what\nare the odds of observing Patient Zero?], a superspreader event happens at the\nwet market\". This story is bad for zoonotic proponents because it doesn't have\na high odds ratio of P(.|zoonotic)/P(.|LL)The response is \"well, we can't be\nmissing the first few generations because we know the doubling rate and if\nwere missing the first few generations then by January there would have been\nfar more deaths/cases\". And then conclude:(i) \"well Covid can't have started\nearlier, so there can't be meaningful early non-market spread, so anyone who\nlooks early and is unlinked must have had a really short incubation period\",\n[even though ex ante that's less likely and should be penalised].(ii) \"well,\nCovid can't have started earlier, so even though Lineage A looks older, since\nLineage B is more common, it must have started spreading first\"But these\ndeterministic timing arguments are nonsense because not only is stochasticity\npotentially important anytime you have small n, the over dispersion of Covid\nspread is huge so the variance of spread early on is very high. The most\ncommon number of people for someone to infect is 0. The second most common is\n1. The vast majority of spread is driven by a small minority of infected\npeople.So the argument dismissing the Lineage A vs Lineage B point dies\nimmediately. (Suppose Lineage A has a 1-2 generation head start. What is the\nprobability that a month hence it has more people infected than Lineage B, if\nboth have identical latent spread potential? It won't be far off 50-50, even\nif you condition on both surviving, which we should). You don't even need to\npenalise Lineage B being smaller as \"improbable bad luck, what a coincidence\nthat the more predominant lineage is the one at the market\", because while\nthere is probably lots of room for random luck, the most likely reason Lineage\nB \"got lucky\" and outgrew A early on is that it (by happenstance) spread at\nthe market while A did not. E.g. if I tell you \"Lineage X has a 1-2 generation\nhead start, but the first known Lineage Y case is at the wet market, which\nlineage has larger share a few generations hence\", isn't the smart money on\nY?And the point of \"the total outbreak would be too big by date T if it\nstarted a couple generations earlier\" also dies immediately because the 95% CI\nof outbreak size after 1-2 months given a t0 probably covers at least an order\nof magnitude.It seems really bad for Peter's arguments in general that he\nwould consistently make this obviously wrong argument, to argue against\nmultiple lines of evidence, seemingly without realizing that it is\nwrong.Expand full commentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n\u00c9corch\u00e9Mar 28I can't find the ref, but there was a paper that looked at\nchanges in reporting criteria during the outbreak.

I don't think that changing the\ndispersion/superspreading rate (k) would impact it as much.Changing January\nsize is hard because you can bound that by excess deaths and serology. And you\ncan measure R0 in other cities besides Wuhan, so you can't make that so much\nsmaller.I am, of course, not sufficiently confident in this model to say,\n\"there were exactly 70 cases in Wuhan, on December 10th\". There's a range of\nvalues, both because the parameters aren't exact, because there's a\nstatistical range even within given parameters, and because the model may not\nperfectly represent reality.None of this absolutely disproves a lab leak,\neither. It just makes it very unlikely because the lab leak needs to cross\ntown to the market within, say, the first 40 cases or less.

My bayes argument would be something\nlike \"If covid WAS leaked from the Wuhan research lab, how plausible is that\npicture of events?\" If so I'd expect an average amount of \"well, we don't\nknow\" for scientific research. But each thing that needs to be explained away\nrapidly adds to \"that doesn't sound right\". Today I learned that they did do\nmodifications like this. But I also learned that they were usually publishing\ntheir research like any academic institution, so you need coincidences or\ncover-up to suppress anything they'd done on COVID specifically.This includes\na lot of things that I don't know. But I still like my reasoning, because I\nknow there's lots of biologists out there who have a better picture than me.\nAnd I haven't heard of any reason for biologists to avoid thinking about a lab\nleak, and don't think it's likely there could be a reason that wouldn't be\nwell-known. (Whereas there ARE reasons for physicists to dislike many worlds,\nor doctors to dislike \"chronic fatigue exists and easy weight loss doesn't\")\nBut what I usually hear from random biologists is \"well, yeah, it could be,\nbut I don't have any particular reason to think it is\". And so I think that's\nprobably right.I'm interested in the ways of putting more specific numbers\ninto reasoning but I think you can rapidly get into territory where it's hard\nto tell if the reasoning is sound. E.g. trying to describe how much of a\ncoincidence each theory is raises questions like, if it was zoontic, how many\nother places would have sounded as suspicious as the wuhan research lab?\nRestricted secret areas? Other kinds of labs? How unique is the nearby lab, in\nadvance? If it was a leak, how many places would have seemed as suspicious as\na wet market? Nowhere else seems very suspicious, but \"coming out of nowhere\"\nwould have seemed completely plausible for zoonotism. Or how much are the lab\nand the pandemic both there because there's convenient reservoirs of\ncoronoviruses nearby, that could be, I've no idea. I think trying to make\nthese precise leads to \"things we didn't know we needed to account for\"\nswamping the analysis.I ought to read how the probability calculation is\nactually working. I would be really interested.

That seems pretty plausible from a general \"we can't\nusually trace outbreaks back to an individual person\" expectation. This debate\nshowed some argument why it's plausible it started at the market, but I don't\nunderstand the biology well enough to really know. But it doesn't really\naffect how likely I think a lab leak is, that's more based on the default in\nthe absence of evidence being spontaneous mutation, not the specific evidence\nfor the market origin.Expand full commentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nSam OwensMar 28Perhaps this description of the debate wrongly magnifies this,\nbut it struck me as really discrediting to the lab leak side that they kept\nrelying on debunked claims.

One of the most annoying habits conspiracy-adjacent thinkers\nonline have is to gish-gallop between weak evidence they're only lightly\nacquainted with, and then not change anything about their thinking when a\npiece of evidence is disproven.

It's not\nlike the mutating virus would know that it happened to mutate near a lab.\nHowever, the second part is only a grand coincidence if we assume that if\nthere was a lab leak, that it was a) fully accidental, and that b) no one\nacting in bad faith had the ability to distort data from early testing,\netc..I'm not sure I'm of the opinion that lab leak is thus more likely. But I\ncan't help but think: it sure would be convenient if you were a lab\nresearcher/administrator/related government official and you didn't want to be\nblamed for something you negligently made possible - then it sure is\nconvenient that there is that nice big wet market nearby that perhaps you can\nshift the blame toward.My current thoughts: though I didn't sit through the 15\nhours - I am now of the opinion that the zoonotic hypothesis is stronger than\nI had thought before. I am updating to be less confident in the lab leak. But\nI'm probably now to about even odds, fwiw.Expand full commentReply (3)Share  \n---  \n  \nLucae/alphaMar 28Exactly my thought.

That it\nappeared in a wet market near a particular stall feels like strong evidence\nbecause it's so specific, but -any- real world-case would be equally specific\n- what we actually need to consider is the full reference class of places\nwhich might -feel- weirdly specific. Like, it had first appeared in a zoo with\nan on-site veterinary clinic which regularly treats wild animals. My local zoo\ndoes this, although I can't find statistics on how common this is. Or maybe\nthe zoo just got a shipment of wild animals, which isn't that unusual,\nparticularly in China. (Sure, none of the shipment of animals tested positive,\nbut did any of the raccoon-dogs test positive?) Or maybe it first showed up in\na restaurant who had a staff member test positive, and who had recently been\nat a wet market.That it first showed up where it did, then, doesn't actually\ngive us very much evidence for or against a zoonotic origin - the reference\nclass for places that intuitively feel weirdly coincidental/specific is huge,\nbecause the specificity is post-hoc.However, that it showed up where it did\nrelative to a coronavirus research laboratory researching not just the\ndisease, but the specific thing that made the disease such a problem, is much\nmore unusual; there are only a handful of places in the world which satisfy\neven a broadened criteria.You'd have to have quite high priors against a\nlaboratory leak happening at all to arrive at a conclusion, based purely on\nthe location of first observation, to think that it is zoonotic based on that\ninformation.

When humans are inserting\nfurin cleavage sites into viruses for gain-of-function, the standard practice\nis RRKR, a very nice and simple furin cleavage site which works well. COVID\nuses PRRAR, a bizarre furin cleavage site which no human has ever used before,\nand which virologists expected to work poorly. They later found that an\nadjacent part of COVID\u2019s genome twisted the protein in an unusual way that\nallowed PRRAR to be a viable furin cleavage site, but this discovery took a\nlot of computer power, and was only made after COVID became important. The\nWuhan virologists supposedly doing gain-of-function research on COVID\nshouldn\u2019t have known this would work.

Virologists aren't the once who take decisions\nin bioweapons research. It's the army guys. And they don't accept public\nscrutiny.My point was about what the field of virology should be doing right\nnow. I assume that their research paths have been affected by Covid. Scott was\nsuggesting that they should get out there and debate the public to make the\ncase that it probably wasn't the lab leak.

I'm a teacher, and I\n\"lie\" to the children I teach all the time. I do it because they're not yet\nready to process the full complexity of English grammar yet. I would expect\nvirology experts to say different things to people inside the field than they\ndo to people outside the field. So when we observe them doing that, I don't\nreally see it as a \"lie\". For example, it would seem perfectly reasonable to\nme if they chose to communicate to the media the *most* likely origin story as\nunderstood by their field, i.e. wild animal origin; while internally\ndiscussing the less likely but more dramatic possibility of a lab leak. That\ndoesn't sound mendacious, it sounds like normal professional behaviour.But I\ncould be wrong about that. Perhaps a significant number of virologists (not\nall, remember they're not a monolith) behaved badly in the immediate aftermath\nof the outbreak. Even if they did, that absolutely does not invalidate the\nwhole field of virology, or suggest that virologists need to be put under\ngreater public scrutiny.

Which is why I\nbrought up the field's questionable contribution.The lying invalidates the\na-priori trust in the decision-making that the field enjoyed beforehand. If\nthere's a real chance the field is a net negative, and I know for sure that\nsuch possibilities are exactly what you might be lying about, you don't get to\ntell me \"oh trust me I'm a scientist\" without so much as the courtesy to even\nshow up to debate something that tons of intelligent people disagree about.Two\nmore general points.Firstly, I think you're under-playing the role and duty of\nscience in education and enlightenment of society. If the origins of such a\nworld-changing event are of interest to the public, and the opinions of the\npublic (including the generally well-educated public) strongly disagree with\nscientific consensus - it is a failure.Secondly, I think you're overestimating\nscientists. I did a PhD (in an entirely unrelated field) and am married to a\npost-doctoral researcher in a biology-flavored field (involving RNA, as it\nhappens) and I had many opportunities to see how the sausage is made. It's not\npretty. And it's not pretty exactly in a way pertinent to our discussion. Ego,\ndesperate need to publish or to secure a grant at the expense of quality,\nintegrity, basic decency. I absolutely do not believe that their internal and\nopaque communications are more likely to be truth-seeking and productive than\nanything exposed to broader scrutiny.Some aspects of modern science are\nprofoundly broken, and there's every reason to believe that viral GoF is not\none of the healthier ones. So when there's a reasonable debate about its\nusefulness, they do not get to go \"please play quietly in the corner while we\nbrilliant grown-ups decide matters\".

In contrast to those, nothing about\nthe debate felt like dull filler, and yet, unlike most really demanding books,\nit was possible to miss bits here and there without losing the overall thread\nof the argument. It's almost a perfect format for content to listen to while\nslightly distracted, and I think that for that reason, debates like this can\nprovide a ton of value to people beyond just shifting their opinions on the\ntopic.Granted, a text format would probably result in slightly better\narguments- though I don't buy that Peter ambushing Saar with new claims was a\nmajor factor in his loss; the lab leak side had plenty of time to research\nclaims between debates, and plenty of time to respond later. A book-length\nwritten debate, however, is something I expect almost nobody would be willing\nto read, since it doesn't provide that extra value as good content to consume\nwhile doing other things. It would also require a lot more effort on the part\nof the debators, so I'd expect there to be both fewer long-form debates and\nmuch less engagement- and I don't think a slight bump in quality would at all\nmake up for that loss of value.Expand full commentReply (2)Share  \n---  \n  \nRadarMar 28Oh interesting argument, I like that.

Everyone knew that wet markets were a\npotential risk center for spreading diseases. See for example:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7141584/ about the 2003 Avian\nFlue outbreak. That's the same year that China approved construction of a\nbiosafety level 4 lab at WIV.They built the lab there because it was a good\nplace to gather research data, and maybe also because the local government was\nstrongly interested in that sort of research to protect themselves. It's the\nsame reason that the \"Center for the Study of Active Volcanoes\" is in Hawaii,\nthe \"Earthquake Engineering Research Institute\" is in California, and the\n\"Hurricane Resilience Research Institute\" is in Houston. Of *course* they are\nthere where the threat is greatest. And gain-of-function research was just the\nmost effective means of researching that kind of virus, if you want to\nresearch it before it actually starts spreading.You might ask, if they knew\nthe threat of wet markets, why didn't they just shut them down? My\nunderstanding is that China doesn't have that kind of state power. There are\ntoo many poor, rural people who really want to eat meat, and still can't\nafford ranch-raised animals.

Something like this is\ntrue for the other Chinese wet market based outbreaks we know about it. So\nthis makes the opposite point you think it does: wet markets start outbreaks\nbecause there are infected goods being sold there. Then the virus spreads\nthrough the wet market at a completely normal rate.I definitely know that\nChina ascribed COVID outbreaks to things like \"the person in the plane on the\nprevious flight left covid residue\". China was desperate to explain every\noutbreak so they could continue attempting to achieve a horrible and\nimpossible goal. I don't actually believe that is how the virus was spreading?\nIn particular, surface contact spread and the idea that you should wet wipe\nyour boxes quickly fell out of style. I think the ubiquity of spreads getting\nfirst observed at wet markets during covid zero is strong evidence that even\nif covid is zoonotic but first entered the population by like, bats during a\nvacation, you would still have first observed it in the wet market.I filled\nthis out with others' hidden, and ended up weighing that even less than Saar\ndid, which probably means I'm overly\ndismissive.https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IOHp6PINEbqizpbO7liXLEQTsIuNRpqx/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113816084183231439418&rtpof=true&sd=trueExpand\nfull commentReply (1)Share  \n---  \n  \nKenny EaswaranMar 28I think that surface contact spread and the idea that you\nshould wipe your boxes very naturally fell out of style, because it's probably\nseveral orders of magnitude less likely a mode of transmission than airborne\ndirectly from a person.

Many Thanks!Expand full\ncommentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nSteve ByrnesMar 28Way back in 2020 there was an article\nhttps://www.independentsciencenews.org/commentaries/a-proposed-origin-for-\nsars-cov-2-and-the-covid-19-pandemic/ , which I read after George Church\ntweeted it (!) (without comment or explanation). Their proposal (they call it\n\"Mojiang Miner Passage\" theory) in brief was that it WAS a lab leak but NOT\ngain-of-function. Rather, in April 2012, six workers in a \"Mojiang mine fell\nill from a mystery illness while removing bat faeces. Three of the six\nsubsequently died.\" Their symptoms were a perfect match to COVID, and two were\nvery sick for more than four months.The proposal is that the virus spent those\nfour months adapting to life in human lungs, including (presumably) evolving\nthe furin cleavage site. And then (this is also well-documented) samples from\nthese miners were sent to WIV. The proposed theory is that those samples were\nput in a freezer at WIV for a few years while WIV was constructing some new\nlab facilities, and then in 2019 researchers pulled out those samples for\nstudy and infected themselves.I like that theory! I\u2019ve like it ever since\n2020! It seems to explain many of the contradictions brought up by both sides\nof this debate\u2014it\u2019s compaible with Saar\u2019s claim that the furin cleavage site\nis very different from what\u2019s in nature and seems specifically adapted to\nhumans, but it\u2019s also compatible with Peter\u2019s claim that the furin cleavage\nsite looks weird and evolved. It\u2019s compatible with Saar\u2019s claim that WIV is\nsuspiciously close to the source of the outbreak, but it\u2019s also compatible\nwith Peter\u2019s claim that WIV might not have been set up to do serious GoF\nstudies. It\u2019s compatible with the data on differences between COVID and other\npreviously-known viruses. Etc. (As I understand it.)Old as this theory is, the\nauthors are still pushing it and they claim that it\u2019s consistent with all the\nevidence that\u2019s come out since then (see https://jonathanlatham.net/ ).

I hope you\u2019ll\nforgive me if I can't find the exact quote, but in the initial MMP theory\nJohnathan explictly said something in the line of \"one thing that will be a\nbig problem for the MMP theory is if the virus hunt yields a genetically\ncloser ancestor to SARS-CoV-2 than RaTG13\". And we found one : BANAL-52.\nJohnathan handwave it by saying \"we found it in north Laos, and north Laos is\ngeographically the same thing as Mojiang\".But we don\u2019t know where exactly the\nmine is in Mojiang county (eyeballing google maps, it\u2019s 300 km from north\nMojiang to south Mojiang). More problematic, the paper that announced the\ndiscovery of BANAL-52 never said it was found in north Laos ; indeed they say\nthat all BANAL clades were found in the same site, \"site 1\", which was in east\nLaos, close to (again, eyeballing the map) Pak Lay, which, again by eyeballing\nGoogle Maps, is close to 800 km to Mojiang county.This is a big problem for\nMMP theory, I haven\u2019t seen a good answer to that.But to be fair, it\u2019s a big\nproblem for the Wuhan wet market theory too.

But that raises the question of why we got\nan outbreak of a virus with that Furin cleavage site, instead of a\nhypothetical precursor that lacks it.

I think this lands in\nthe genre of competency porn and I'm here for it.A meta-observation: I started\ntoday 50-50 on this question. Right after reading it, I was briefly at 90-10\nzoonotic. An hour or two later, I'd say it slipped to 75-25, and now I'm\nlanding maybe at 60-40. That's an interesting experience just to watch over\nthe course of a day. I don't know, but I think if I read it all over again, it\nmight goose me back up to 80-20, temporarily.When I ask myself why looking at\nthe debate as presented swings me a lot but then that regresses over hours, I\nwould summarize that as \"mistrust\". Mistrust of the institutions that produce\ninformation, mistrust of the arguments presented, mistrust of the biasing\npotential of the debate format. That's my emotional/psychological bias and so\nthe further I get from direct contact with the elements of the debate (which I\nfound persuasive), then that default bias starts to take over more.While my\nintuition listens along to the content of the debate, it also has some deeply-\nheld opinions about the trustworthiness (or lack thereof) of experts. I have\nmy hobbyhorse example of this around guidance to parents for what position to\nput their infants down to sleep -- which has changed three times since my\nadulthood. It's not that anyone was misleading anyone, but that things that\nlook absolutely true to science in one era turn out to be absolutely wrong in\nthe next era and that's how science proceeds. We don't know what we don't\nknow, and that makes all my reactions to these kinds of competing stories\npretty uncertain. And it also makes me marvel at other people's certainty.I\ndon't know, but I think this might have some relevance for questions people\nask about how to persuade people about the importance of large scale risks\nbased on a mish-mash of reasoning and data.

The\nChinese authorities who did the search have been clear on this (Bahry, 2023,\nTable 1 and Fig. 1).E.g. we now know that the raccoon dog stall was sampled 10\ntimes, with 5/10 positive; while the pool of blood outside a beef stall in the\neast wing was only sampled once, with 1/1 positive (Liu et al., 2023; cf.\nBahry, 2023, Fig. 1). That, not the racoon dog stall, was the highest\npositivity ratio. Peter's heatmap was based on a paper by some Western\nscientists who had no idea how many times each stall had been sampled, and had\ninstead speculated that every sampled stall had been sampled equally (Worobey\net al., 2022).* After Jesse Bloom also showed there's no positive association\nbetween raccoon dog and SARS-CoV-2 genetic material, nothing implicates them,\nnot even in a God's-joke way (Bloom, 2023).China CDC director George Gao has\nalso emphasized, when asked by the host of a BBC podcast, that this\noverwhelming ascertainment bias means you can't assume genuine case clustering\naround HSM (https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m001ng7c,\n24:00\u201325:12).ReferencesBahry, D.

But the B.1 mutations\nmade the virus better adapted to humans, so it would need to then travel to\nWuhan and revert back to something less well adapted and then mutate into B.1\nagain.A far more likely theory is that the 1 sample from Brazil and 1 sample\nfrom Italy were processed in labs where someone was a little bit sick.Expand\nfull commentReply (2)Share  \n---  \n  \n\u00c9corch\u00e9Mar 29I think one of the Italy studies tested samples from a range of\ndates, with positivity showing up maybe in mid-December?

The\nstored samples are physically sorted chronologically, because this is a\nresearch lab and research labs like to be organized and alphabetical order\nwouldn't make sense in this case. Material from an \"actual, for-real positive\"\nsample contaminates its neighbors.2\\. The work of studying the samples is\npassed to multiple people. The work is divided into chronological batches. By\na stroke of luck, a positive-but-asymptomatic employee happens to handle and\ncontaminate the batch of samples immediately preceding the \"actual, for-real\npositive\" batch.3\\. The samples are stored \"bottom to top\", chronological\norder, and processed \"top to bottom\". Residue from an actual, for-real\npositive sample is left behind in lab equipment.4\\. (comedy option) All the\nsamples are processed by one person in chronological order. None of the\nsamples originally contained covid, but the one person processing them caught\ncovid at some point and began contaminating the batches as they worked on\nthem. All the positives are false.Basically, jokes aside, it becomes a lot\nmore likely (or at least less-unlikely) when you consider the on-the-ground\nhuman aspects of lab work and sample storage.Expand full commentReply (1)Share  \n---  \n  \nAristophanesApr 2This feels like a good real life example why it is extremely\nhard for the LR from any specific piece of information to ever be extremely\nlarge, say 10000. Above some value, \"if I am wrong, it is most likely this is\ndue not to bad luck, but due to a fundamental error in my model of the world\".\nIn this case, for example, rather than testing \"did these samples have Covid\"\nwhat we really are measuring is \"did laboratory testing of samples, including\nvarious forms of human error, detect Covid\". When priors are very small, false\npositives are relatively likely.There is an analogy to frequent statistics\nhere. Even with the standard \"correct\" interpretation of a p-value, p is not\n\"the probability of something this extreme occurring by chance if there is no\ntrue effect\". It's more like \"the probability of something this extreme\noccurring by chance if there is no true effect and we are modelling the DGP\ncorrectly, for example assuming that there are no omitted Zs that are\nconditionally correlated with the X variable of interest\". It doesn't tell you\n\"how likely is this result to go away if I control for additional truly-\nimportant variables\". So when a p-value is very small, if the result *is*\nwrong, it is much more likely to be wrong not due to sampling luck, but due to\nmisspecification / a violation of the identifying assumption.Expand full\ncommentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nNicholas HaldenMetropolitan EatingMar 30Informative blog post, thank\nyou.Expand full commentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nThomas StearnsMar 29\u00b7edited Mar 29I mentioned this elsewhere, but how is an\nearly December market outbreak consistent with a 3.5 day doubling time?

They can talk about likelihoods and logical fallacies all they\nwant, but the problem is that no one has any hard evidence. Peter's obviously\nthe smartest one in the room here, but just being intelligent is of no use if\nyou don't have anything to work with. Sure, you can take a bunch of\ncircumstantial evidence and then claim that they make your theory more likely\nby pulling numbers out of your ass, but none of that gets you any closer to\nverifying the actual truth. And at this point, actually verifying the cause of\nCOVID is likely impossible-- any hard evidence would have been burned by the\nCCP, since even they don't have anything to gain by knowing the truth....So\nwhat's even the point of all of this? As others have pointed out, the actual\ndangers of wet markets or GoF research is completely independent of whether or\nnot COVID in particular was caused by either of them. One event doesn't change\nthe reality of the systems at play. We already agree on the information that\nmatters: that the situation was potentially preventable by the CCP, and that\nthey failed to do so.

You care about the probabilities only because of the\noff-chance that during your lifetime CCP will fall from power or something\nequally dramatic will happen in China, which makes the authorities open the\narchives so it is possible to check if what you thought was probably the\ncause, was actually the cause.(2) You portray yourself as a participant in the\nworld, and want to influence policy-makers and your fellow man to limit\nthreatening risks. The probabilities you and/or others assign to possible\ncauses serve as calls to action to do something to change/reduce the\nprobability of similar pandemics in the future.These motivations are very\ndifferent. They are likely to influence your own stated probabilities, as well\nas how you interpret why others offer the probabilities they do.Expand full\ncommentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nVitorMar 29This is a highly interesting topic. Unfortunately I don't have the\nenergy tonight to get deep into all the great points brought up in the post.\nBut I want to share a few scattered thoughts in babble mode:(1) Taking a 5%\nchance of dying on a climb is pure insanity. Maaaybe taking a 5% *lifetime*\nrisk is worth it if you really love climbing. Hardly an endorsement for\nrisking $100k at 4%.(2) It's a terrible idea to offer a standing bet on your\ntrue beliefs. You're literally doing adverse selection and end up with a\nsneaky rules lawyer as your debate \"partner\".(3) It seems that Peter is just a\ngood debater, of the \"debate club\" variety. Laser focused on winning the\ndebate, rather than finding truth. I was repulsed by the dirty arguments made,\nfor example the quibbling about whether to call the first outbreak a\n\"superspreader event\" or not. Regardless of the completely irrelevant doubling\ntimes Peter brings up multiple times, a place like the Wuhan market clearly is\na mechanism for turning a handful of cases into 80k cases. I've only skimmed\nthe *summary* of the debate, so please point me to where Peter tackles the\nreal underlying issue head on.(4) Re: orders of magnitude. There is no limit\nto how badly you can fuck up a bayesian estimate. For example, Peter's 1 in\n10'000 probability of the first infected person working at the wet market.\nThat's just a uniform prior! It's so, so bad. The easiest way to debunk this\nis to take these odds, and start listing conclusions that would need to follow\nif they were actually correct: \"viruses are equally likely to spread to\neveryone regardless of their profession and their position in the social\ngraph\"... um no, everyone with an inch of common sense (or kids) knows that\nviruses spread where people gather: schools, workplaces, and yes, markets. The\nvendor at that market didn't need to be the first, merely among the first\n*few*, and then keep coming to work while contagious.(4a) It strikes me this\nmight be a valuable method to flesh out. Let's call it the *reverse inference\ntest\". I don't know why, I just feel like it latches onto my intuitions more\ncleanly than trying to refute a claim in the same direction it's made.(5)\nProbability cascades are bullshit. To me, this is the classic example of\n\"science as attire\"; you pretend to be scientific by multiplying numbers\ntogether, but what you're really doing is spinning a narrative. It's extremely\nhard to come up with an exhaustive enumeration of posibilities. MECE, as it's\nsometimes called (mutually exclusive, collectively encompassing). Or for the\nmathy people, an equivalence relation on the possible states of reality. If\nyou doubt this, go take an advanced algorithms class and report back. I'm not\njoking... repeated encounters with impartial yet implacable entities\n(compilers, test suites, theorem provers, etc) will drill this into you like\nnothing else. Peter's argument style is that of a college freshman, and any\ncompetent math mentor would beat it out of him before it rots his brain. To\nthe extent Peter is aware of this, it just reinforces (3).(5a) to clarify the\nabove point, the typical mistakes made is multiplying together probabilities\nthat aren't independent, and to implicitly assume that the only way to reach\nstate X is the specific path towards X you've laid out. These can make a 50%\nevent seem like a 1% event, or the other way around.(6) Explicit bayesian\ncalculations in the absence of a *formal model* are a horrible idea. It just\ntakes confusion and multiplies it by orders of magnitude. What I've learned in\nmy time as a scientist is that the relationship between the real world and the\nmodel you're working on, and how to transport assumptions and conclusions back\nand forth between them, is one of the hardest things to get right. And we\ndon't really have a systematic way of teaching this skill.(7) If you wanted to\nblackpill me on the applicability of bayesian calculations to everyday life,\nyou've succeeded. In particular, I see no reason to update my beliefs\nregarding the lab leak hypothesis in response to this debate. I'm still 50%+\nin favor.Wow, that was a lot more than I thought.

Everyone *on\nboth sides* including the Worobey group and the WIV, agrees that the ancestral\nvirus is in Yunnan or SE Asia. Miller keeps denying this but it is so totally\nat odds with all of the evidence, that you have to ask questions of him\nhere.2\\. The claim therefore has to be that the raccoon dog was infected in\nYunnan and taken to a farm in Hubei where it acquired the furin cleavage site\nin Oct or Nov 2019. There is no direct evidence of this, and raccoon dogs roam\nwild in Hubei, so it seems weird for them to ship them from Yunnan. There is\nno evidence that raccoon dogs can sustain such intense transmission to cause\nacquisition of the furin site as happens with avian influenza, and lab\nexperiments suggest that they cannot do this. Freuling et al found an R0 of 1\nin their experimental infection of raccoon dogs.3\\. Raccoon dogs have never\nbeen found infected outside of a lab, unlike eg mink.4\\. If lots of raccoon\ndogs on a farm get infected, why were there no outbreaks anywhere except Wuhan\ncity where the farm was supplying? If you are envisioning thousands of\ninfected raccoon dogs on a farm, this is a big BF in favor of the lab. It only\nreally works if you are envisioning about 100-200 raccoon dogs on a farm, but\nthen you are conditioning on a very specific farm size, and we have evidence\nthat the typical farm is an order of magnitude larger.5\\. The raccoon dogs\nwere wild caught in Hubei. Wang et al 2022 tested 15 wild caught raccoon dogs\nat the suppliers of the market in Jan 2020 and they were found negative.\nAround 38 raccoon dogs were sold at four markets per month. So, this is half\nof the inventory. The raccoon dogs photographed at the market were agreed by\nthe Worobey group to be wild caught in Hubei. Maybe you think half of the\nraccoon dogs were topped up from farms in Hubei. There is no evidence for\nthis. If they were topped up from fur farms, they would have been in eastern\nChina, even further from the ancestral bat viruses.6\\. So, the claim is now\nthat these ~10 raccoon dogs are responsible for the outbreak. This is an\nextremely small fraction of the total wildlife trade in China, and conditions\nthe zoonosis hypothesis on an extremely specific proposition. To justify this,\none would need extremely strong countervailing evidence of raccoon dogs being\nthe intermediate host. But what we do have is extremely small traces of covid\nin their cages and a negative correlation of raccoon dog genetic material with\ncovid. Whereas for the viruses that the animals in the market were actually\ninfected by, like bamboo rats covs or canine covs, there is a strong\ncorrelation. Miller's claim that 'we have down to the stall' is just wrong.The\ncollective BFs in favor of this causal chain are extremely weak, and in fact\nrule out raccoon dogs.Expand full commentReply (1)Share  \n---  \n  \nEMSKE PhytochemPraxidike PapyrusApr 4Just noting this comment implicitly\nreferences Jesse Bloom's work.

The vast majority of his evidence is\nbasically \"if things were different in a way we can't know, then our\nconclusions would also be different, therefore lab leak.\" E.g. \"if COVID\nspread rate was lower in the beginning\", \"if an infected WIV worker spread to\nthe wet market then isolated\", and so on. That's it, really? I was expecting\nso much more actual evidence. And then what data points they do provide (e.g.\n\"Mr Chen\", 90 cases, intermediates, etc) have apparently valid reasons why\nthey're not evidence. I started out 60/40 zoonotic, but based on this I feel I\nhave no choice but to update to 99/1.I feel the real problem with this\nsetup/framework is that a specific position is taken, with overly-precise\nnumbers, and the goal of the debate is to simply justify that final\npercentage. You see this with Saar's \"but the judges just did the math wrong\"\nsour grapes complaint.In the IT and infosec world, we have the FAIR method--a\nsimilar method for building quantified models of risks. The real value of\nthese isn't that you convinced yourself you have only a 1-in-10000 chance of\nbeing compromised by a state actor in the next 10 years... it's the shared\nunderstanding of the risks your business thinks are important, how you think\nthose risks are correlated, how you think they're evolving over time, etc.\nThat enables your organization to act from shared goals, and not get bogged\ndown in interminable debates day-to-day. The final numbers are fine,\nespecially if you use confidence intervals, but you know it's only a snapshot\nin time using your best data and estimates as of the last time you underwent\nthe exercise; by the time you update in a year/quarter, you will have more\ndata and different estimates. Sometimes, risks that weren't even on your model\nlast cycle, are now the top priority because of what's happening in the world\n(or because you gained new information that you missed previously). It's a\nfact of life.With that in mind, I think Saar fares better if his arguments are\nframed as reducing absolute confidence in zootonic origin, and not the reason\nwhy LL is the only possible explanation (which it obviously isn't, even from\nSaar's own arguments). So yeah, I was only joking about updating to 99% in\nfavor of Z--I think there's enough doubt thrown in from Saar's evidence alone\nthat it could not possibly be more than 80%. But Peter/Z still wins this\nversion of the debate, and Saar's over-confidence in \"no way it's anything\nother than LL, here's the math to prove it, and if you disagree then you're\ndoing the math wrong\" does border on pseudoscience here.To that end, I think\nScott's final takeaways are the most important. If we have any shared goals\nanymore as a society, then we should devote resources to better preparing for\npandemics from both origins, and in also improving government/organizational\ntransparency so it's easier next time to understand what went wrong. As it is,\neither a natural disaster can be ignored because \"teh government conspiracy,\"\nor else somebody got away with murder; either way, the debates that focus\nsolely on convincing everybody that one's favored position is the only\nexplanation means we're not more prepared for future disasters than we were\nwith this one, we're just more divided and easier to manipulate.Expand full\ncommentReply (1)Share  \n---  \n  \npolscistoicpolscistoic\u2019s SubstackMar 31\"The final numbers are fine, especially\nif you use confidence intervals, but you know it's only a snapshot in time\nusing your best data and estimates as of the last time you underwent the\nexercise; by the time you update in a year/quarter, you will have more data\nand different estimates.

The Wuhan CDC is *right next to\nthe market*. And while it doesn't seem that the Wuhan CDC was conducting gain\nof function research, their employees were fanning out all over China going\ninto bat caves.From this Washington Post article -\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/coronavirus-bats-china-\nwuhan/2021/06/02/772ef984-beb2-11eb-922a-c40c9774bc48_story.html\"In the video,\nthe researchers scale the cavern wall, their headlamps ghostly blue.\u201cIf our\nskin is exposed, it can easily come in contact with bat excrement and\ncontaminated matter, which means this is quite risky,\u201d says Tian Junhua\n[\"associate chief technician in the Wuhan CDC\u2019s pest-control department, but\nhe has a reputation as a swaggering adventurer in his work with bats and\ninsects\"], one of the bat hunters....The video was released by national\nscience authorities and Chinese state broadcaster CCTV on Dec. 10, 2019, and\ncirculated on social media. It\u2019s a high-quality production, designed to\npromote China\u2019s world-leading viral research....Tian and his team from the\nWuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention are filmed catching horseshoe\nand pipistrelle bats and collecting samples of guano, in search of new bat-\nborne diseases and the basis of new vaccines. Tian talks about the need for\ncaution. \u201cIt is while discovering new viruses that we are most at risk of\ninfection,\u201d he says, though he is shown handling sample vials without wearing\nfull protective gear....In 2017, Tian told the state-run Wuhan Evening News he\nonce forgot personal protective equipment and was splattered with bat urine,\nleading him to quarantine at home for two weeks.

By the start of this\nyear, after way more than 15 hours of studying way more evidence than I\nimagined we would ever have, I was at 80% lab leak, 20% natural origin, After\nthis, maybe I should update to 70% lab leak, 30% natural origin. But I'm going\nto indulge in a bit of emotion and make that 25% lab leak, 100%\nannoyed.Annoyed in that it seems like the rationalist and rationalist-adjacent\ncommunity, parts of which at least I value and respect, has decided that on\nthis one issue we're going to flip a $100K coin to decide what to believe, and\nI suspect anyone who dissents will at best be quietly dismissed as an\nignoramus by much of the community. I will grant that by paying $100K, we got\na coin that is *slightly* biased towards the truth,Seriously, one-on-one\npersonal realtime debate is a *lousy* way to find the truth.

The process selects for\nthe most skilled and charismatic debater, and in some cases for the favor of\nbiased judges, with the truth mostly just serving as a tiebreaker.In this\ncase, there was no tie to break. Miller, by all accounts including this one,\nis an exceptionally capable debater. Wilf, while clearly skilled as an\nentrepreneur and possibly as an analyst, does not seem to be very good at in-\nperson debate. From this very thorough account, Wilf completely failed to\nraise some of the very strong points in favor of the lab leak hypothesis,\nfailed to call out Miller on some of his indefensibly weak points, and agreed\nto a structure where he'd open by spending the first third of the debate on\nthe very weak assertion, \"maybe it didn't come from the Wet Market\" even\nthough that is in no way necessary to the lab leak case. Or maybe he did raise\nthe strong points and call out Miller's weak points, but in a way that neither\nScott nor the judges noticed.As for Scott shifting is odds from 50-50 to 90-10\non the basis of this debate, I think that requires p<0.20 for \"Wilf isn't very\ngood at this and left the winning arguments at home\", which I don't think is\ndefensible.

I no longer have confidence this method\nproduces more signal than noise.For example, what prior do you set for an\noutbreak in WSM?

I don't think there was a great difference in rhetorical skill, but\nthere was an extreme difference in both the level of preparedness and the\ncommitment to the cause. This case involves 50+ pieces of circumstantial\nevidence of various degrees of strength, some favoring lab leak and some\nfavoring zoonosis. All the ones favoring lab leak were heavily contested, but\nat least to me it did not seem like the same was true for many of the ones\nfavoring zoonosis. This was probably a mixture of a few things. Saar didn't\nseem to not know enough of the precise details to effectively push back\nagainst some of the bolder zoonosis arguments, such as how confident we should\nbe that we actually have a good picture of the first cluster. In other words,\nhe conceded far too much, allowing the zoonosis side to look much stronger\nthan I suspect many people still believe it is. Secondly, I don't think Saar\nfully understood what his \"role\" in this debate was. Instead of being a\nsoldier for his side, he mostly stuck with his 2-3 year old argument for what\nhe thought the \"truth\" was. Peter, on the other hand, seemed eager to actually\nwin the debate, so he made the maximally strong argument for his cause, not\ngranting anything, as opposed to trying to converge on the \"truth\". So for\nevery piece of evidence, he was able to put on the \"maximally pro zoonosis\"\nspin, perhaps resulting in his absurdly low final lab leak probability.It is\nperhaps interesting to think about how this compares to adversarial\ncollaborations, which are popular in our community. Using the language of\nJulia Galef, one can perhaps think of an adversarial collaboration as a\n\"dance\" between two scouts. Similarly, a debate can perhaps be thought of as a\nbattle between two soldiers. The incentive is to win, not to find the truth.\nThe rootclaim debate looked like a battle between a soldier and a scout, with\nthe predictable result.Expand full commentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nEMSKE PhytochemPraxidike PapyrusMar 30(Disclosure that I support in\nBiosafetyNow, but these are my views and don't necesarily reflect those of\nBN)The Twitter origins debate, which Scott understandably shies away from\n(ref. his most recent tweets, and ofc I certainly don't blame him) represented\nthe richest, most boisterous most tumultuous, most rancorous, most acrimonious\nform of the origins debate I've ever encountered online.

So I'd obviously caution against anyone taking your response itself as\na reasonable attempt at an estimate of the \"correct\" Bayes factors, because\nthis is all very bad epistemic practice! Public explanations and arguments are\nsocial claims, and usually contain heavily filtered evidence (even if\nunconsciously).

And in this case, it was\nwritten by someone who already had a strong view of what the outcome should\nbe, repeated publicly frequently, which makes it doubly hard to accept the\nimplicit necessary claim that it was performed starting from an unbiased point\nat face value!

The added layer of information control\ntypical of the Chinese government makes the situation even more opaque.Maybe\nthis isn't a debate which can be settled based on the available information.\nMaybe that is by design.The real question for me is this- why is any of this\nimportant in the long run? The obvious answer is that it has some bearing on\nhow the world might respond to future pandemics. If it is yet another zoonoses\nthen all the efforts to date to prevent them didn't prevent this one and\nprobably wont prevent the next one, so maybe we should attempt to apply\ndemocratic pressure to make governments do more. I'm not sure they can do much\nmore either way.If laboratory research is behind covid, then this is also not\ncompletely unprecedented (though the level of genetic engineering might be\nsomewhat new). Again, the technology isnt something that can be easily\nregulated by governments. Nucleotide sequence synthesis is relatively\ncentrally controlled by a few large companies with the technical capacity, but\nthat is only one of many ways to generate genetically modified pathogens.\nAgain, we could attempt to apply democratic pressure to democratic\ngovernments, but again that would likely have limited impact.The only thing\nthat really shines through with the whole covid affair was the government and\nhealth authority overreach, panic, incompetence and opportunism. Once again\nnone of this is new. The corporate capture of the medical system has been\nprogressing for decades. At best the whole covid affair is just another\nreminder that authorities do not often have the interests of the individual as\ntheir main priority, and even when they do their capacity to deliver\nfunctional outcomes is usually highly limited. All trends point to this\nsituation worsening in the future.Novel pathogens will likely always remain\npotential black swans, which means that most of the time authorities will over\nreact to their emergence relative to the actual risk posed. Over time this\nwill probably build up broad social resistance to government responses until a\ngenuinely threatening pandemic emerges. The relative difference in perceived\nthreat between pathogens that are novel and fast moving versus those that are\nfamiliar and slow (such as tuberculosis) is also worth contemplating. Our\ninformation ecosystem thrives on novelty. Nobody is going to buy a newspaper\nthat reports the same steady rate of slow deaths from tuberculosis or malaria.\nNo government minister is going to win the fanatical devotion of the masses by\nheroically fighting such unexciting killers.Expand full commentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nDavid BahryApr 1\u00b7edited Apr 2>\"Peter seems to have a photographic memory for\nevery detail of every study he\u2019s ever read.

So even while I find Peter's points as you've summarized them\nto be pretty reasonable, he hurts himself IMHO by making the characterization\nof lab leak as a \"conspiracy theory\", because accusing an opponent of that\nalso happens to be great tribal signaling. And the data on which all of this\nis premised comes from sources like the WHO which is clearly willing to lie\nfor a variety of reasons.So despite finding Peter's arguments here pretty\nreasonable, I can't get over the hump. I also, were I as dishonest as the PH\nestablishment, would be inclined to just say it was a lab leak to induce\npublic fear of gain-of-function research to help eliminate it. I can live with\nthat having been wrong for this one virus, but still wanting to ban such\nresearch because next time it may NOT be wrong, but since most people don't\nreason that way then zoonosis being true is quite a blow to efforts to end\nthis dangerous stuff.

I understand that you likely\nhave dedicated dozens of hours to this post already and reading through a\nmassive updated analysis is likely not especially appealing, but just looking\nat the probabilities alone does a disservice to the immense amount of\nresearch, evidence, and analysis that is included in Michael's write-up. For\nwhat it's worth, I've read an incredible amount of high-effort research and\ndebate on this topic throughout years of following this, and Michael's\nresearch/analysis is the first one that I find convincing. In addition to more\nconvincing Bayesian logic, his research includes crucial compelling\nevidence/information that came out after the debate (or was available but\ndismissed or potentially misrepresented at the time of the debate). I am\ntrying to be as fair to both sides as possible and I honestly can't see how\nsomeone can read Michael's v5.7 post in full and come away with a 90%\nprobability of Zoonosis.
