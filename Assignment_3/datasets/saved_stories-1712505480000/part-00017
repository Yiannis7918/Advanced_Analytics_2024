But this is a non-Euclidean dream rather than a nightmare, an\nimage swathed in warm pinks and turquoises. You poke at the screen with your\nfinger, and a tiny, hooded figure begins to move. You tap on a giant crank,\nand walkways start swinging 90 degrees. Lo, a route presents itself out of\nthis maze.\n\nIn 2014, pulling out your iPhone and playing Monument Valley felt like a cloud\nwas being lifted from your brain. The game was crystalline in its execution:\nevery beautifully composed image, every carefully chosen sound, its handful of\nmeaningful interactions. \u201cI used to talk about it as a sanctuary in your\npocket,\u201d says producer Danny Gray, who is now chief creative officer at the\nLondon-based studio that made Monument Valley, ustwo Games. \u201cYou\u2019re on the\ntube or having a hard time, and you\u2019re able to go into this Zen-like space\nwhere you\u2019re in a kind of flow state\u2014just existing.\u201d\n\nThe world was a different place in 2014. For a start, not everyone had a\nsmartphone, and those who did were a little less plugged into social media\napps than they are today. The term \u201cdoomscrolling\u201d had yet to enter the\npopular lexicon. But even during this ostensibly less anxiety-inducing era,\nthe pressures of the world were not nothing. Enter this serene puzzle\nadventure, which had a knack for making life a little more tolerable\u2014certainly\na little more beautiful. It did so in ways that were concretely different from\nmobile peers like Candy Crush Saga, the free-to-play match-three juggernaut\nthat, in the week before Monument Valley\u2019s release, helped its maker, King,\nsoar to a $7.1 billion valuation on the New York Stock Exchange. Where Candy\nCrush Saga tickled and then gnawed at the brain through design that resembled\nthe kind used in gambling machines (with levels numbering in the thousands),\nMonument Valley could be wrapped up in 90 minutes\u2014a brief and bittersweet\nsojourn without the hangover.\n\nAs far as it\u2019s possible for a multipurpose, multigenerational machine like the\niPhone to have a killer app, Monument Valley was it\u2014like Wii Sports for the\nWii, or Halo for the original Xbox. Its minimalistic design perfectly matched\nthe form, function, and elegance of the device it was played on. Adriaan de\nJongh, maker of the 2017 hit mobile puzzle game Hidden Folks, describes it as\n\u201carchetypical\u201d: \u201cYou played in portrait mode,\u201d he says. \u201cThe puzzles were\nslick and clever; a gameplay session only had to last a handful of minutes.\u201d\nApple seemed to know as much, awarding the game a prestigious Apple Design\nAward in June 2014 and then announcing\u2014and launching\u2014its sequel onstage at\nApple\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference in June 2017 in San Jose.\n\nBut Monument Valley wasn\u2019t even conceived of with the iPhone in mind; at\nfirst, it was meant for the iPad. \u201cInitially, we used to say it was a \u2018coffee-\ntable\u2019 game: big format, bright colors, inviting,\u201d David Fern\u00e1ndez Huerta,\nsenior artist on the game, recalls. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want it to look like a game\ngame. We wanted it to look like something you\u2019d see in a design magazine.\u201d\n\nEven in the process of shrinking Monument Valley to fit the more compact\niPhone screen, this central tenet of its visual design came through loud and\nclear for reviewers. \u201cA painting you can touch,\u201d enthused Kill Screen. \u201cIf\nthere was ever a game that begged to be framed and hung, it is Monument\nValley,\u201d opined The Guardian. The mobile games specialist site TouchArcade\ndescribed it as a \u201cfeast for your senses.\u201d Effusive reviews translated into\ngigantic download numbers on iOS and, starting the month after that initial\nrelease, on Android: some 3 million in the first year and many tens of\nmillions more in the following years (the game has amassed more than 100\nmillion downloads to date). \u201cI remember being totally wowed by it,\u201d says Kyle\nOrland, senior gaming editor at Ars Technica. \u201cFor the gameplay itself, it\nsounds braggy, but I found it kind of simple. But maybe that\u2019s not bragging;\nmaybe that\u2019s just the [way the] game was designed. The solutions came\nnaturally. Your brain wrapped around this weird geometry without too much\neffort.\u201d\n\nHarry Nesbitt, the maker of Alto\u2019s Adventure, another indie mobile darling\nfrom the era of sleek graphic visuals, recalls that part of Monument Valley\u2019s\nappeal lay in how cohesive it felt: \u201cThe sounds, animations, visual effects,\ncolors, gradients\u2014when all of those things combined, it was just delightful\nand very accessible,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was the first time I really played a game\non mobile that I could point to and say, \u2018Yes, this is the kind of thing I\nwant to make.\u2019\u201d\n\nWith such gigantic success, Monument Valley should have become a blueprint for\nindies on mobile (and it did, for the small cohort of artful titles such as\nAlto\u2019s Adventure and Old Man\u2019s Journey that followed soon after it). But as\nthe years wore on, it became clear that the game was really more of an\naberration. Premium mobile games, that is, those that you pay for, eventually\nturned into an endangered species, crowded out by free-to-play \u201cforever game\u201d\nbehemoths such as Clash Royale and, most recently, Monopoly Go! (the latter of\nwhich is partly bankrolled by Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund and spent\nan eye-watering sum of nearly $500 million on marketing and user acquisition\nalone). A binary, then (and thus a battle), presents itself, pitting the art\ngame that values people\u2019s time against the commercial product that seeks to\nexploit it with ever-increasing, capitalistic intensity. \u201cIn 2014, it was just\nthe beginning of that battle,\u201d says Orland. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a clear winner.\u201d\n\nNow, it\u2019s easy to see which way the wind ultimately blew. Cast your eye across\nthe top 50 games on the App Store. Beyond the acclaimed, rogue-like Hades,\nwhich first came out on consoles and computers, there\u2019s hardly a title that\ndoesn\u2019t subscribe to the attention-grabbing and attention-holding logic that\ntook root in the 2010s (and suffused everything from media to politics). For\nthis reason, playing Monument Valley today only reveals its fundamental\nqualities more potently: its lucidity, charm, and deft, artisanal touch. To\nreturn to Gray\u2019s own formulation, the game now offers a greater sanctuary than\nit ever could have a decade ago, and not just because the woes of the world\narguably feel more intense.\n\nSurely,Surely, a quiet, reflective work such as Monument Valley would have\nbeen made under circumstances reflective of such a contemplative mood. Not so,\naccording to its development team, which sat in the busiest part of the\noriginal ustwo office, next to the front doors and sandwiched between the IT\ndepartment and kitchen. The office, located in Shoreditch, an undeniably hip\npart of East London, had a \u201cvery Nathan Barley\u2013esque feel,\u201d says Manesh\nMistry, a programmer on Monument Valley and now ustwo\u2019s technical director.\nMichael Anderson, QA lead on the game, agrees. \u201cIt was just wacky,\u201d he says of\nthe decor, which included a Wendy house with a PlayStation 3 inside. \u201cOne of\nour cofounders, [Matt] \u2018Mills\u2019 [Miller], used to be known as \u2018chief Wonka\u2019 as\nopposed to CEO. His whole thing was to make the space fun and playful.\u201d\n\nExcept ustwo wasn\u2019t cooking up delicious confectionery; it was banking\napps\u2014and, in its earliest days, user interfaces for Sony Ericsson phones. It\nwas first and foremost a design agency rather than a games studio, one that\nlooked conspicuously different from the \u201ccore\u201d games companies that Gray and\nAnderson had worked at before. In Gray\u2019s mind, it wasn\u2019t just \u201cwhite dudes in\nblack hoodies,\u201d but fashion-conscious people \u201cfrom all over the world.\u201d Mistry\nemphasizes the \u201cmultidisciplinary\u201d nature of the workplace, a \u201creal melting\npot of the early days of digital creativity.\u201d\n\nBefore Monument Valley, the games team, which included Mistry and Anderson,\nhad made two warmly, if not rapturously, received mobile puzzle games, 2011\u2019s\nWhale Trail and 2013\u2019s Blip Blup. Now it was time to level up. Mistry,\nAnderson, and a few others were joined by Ken Wong, who had previously served\nas art director on 2011\u2019s Alice: Madness Returns, the sequel to the acclaimed\nthird-person adventure American McGee\u2019s Alice. Gray jumped ship from Hello\nGames, which was in the early stages of developing No Man\u2019s Sky. The group sat\ntogether in their chic surroundings hashing out ideas, some in the form of\ninteractive prototypes and others as little more than pieces of visual art.\nThese would be stuck onto a nearby glass wall, attracting the idle-minded\nattention of passersby. The one ustwo employees kept cooing over was a drawing\nof Wong\u2019s, just a \u201csmall character at the bottom of a portrait screen with a\nvery clean, isometric structure in front of them,\u201d remembers Gray. \u201cThere was\nno crazy M.C. Escher\u2013style stuff yet.\u201d\n\nA few more pieces of concept art were drawn. And then, while making a\nprototype, the team stumbled upon a bug (while dragging some of the\narchitectural building blocks in front of other blocks) that ultimately led to\nthe impossible architecture mechanic. Such was the clarity of the vision, when\nFern\u00e1ndez Huerta joined ustwo a few weeks later, that he \u201cunderstood\nimmediately what the game wanted to be.\u201d Still, he thought there was room for\nimprovement. \u201cIt read as very cold, a bit serious,\u201d he says, a point he made\nwhen quizzed about the prototype in his job interview. It was a moment when\nFern\u00e1ndez Huerta thought to himself: \u201cDo these people want to hear what I\nthink, or do they want me to just say yes?\u201d\n\nA look began to coalesce. On the one hand, Wong\u2019s original art: pristine and\nperhaps a little clinical, yet charged with a deep, tantalizing mystery. On\nthe other, an effort by Fern\u00e1ndez Huerta to soften it: a warmer color palette\nand playful animations, crow people kicking their legs with carefree abandon,\ntotems that hopped like puppies. A further ingredient: minimalist Japanese\nart. Woodblock prints and, perhaps surprisingly, ikebana, the ancient practice\nof flower arranging. There was a \u201csobriety\u201d to these decidedly delicate works,\nsays Fern\u00e1ndez Huerta, and instructive lessons on the \u201ccomposition\u201d of an\nimage from a few key elements.\n\nThen, a battle, or perhaps a creative tussle, over the introduction of plot:\n\u201cKen was adamant that the game shouldn\u2019t have any kind of story whatsoever,\u201d\nrecalls Gray. \u201cHe was keen on the main character being the architecture.\u201d\nWong, the project\u2019s de facto lead, eventually relented, letting players step\ninto the shoes of Ida, a princess who must traverse the world to return the\nso-called sacred geometry she once stole and seek forgiveness. Gray\ncharacterizes the tone of these discussions as \u201cvery direct,\u201d adding, Monument\nValley is the \u201conly game I\u2019ve worked on where someone has told me to \u2018fuck\noff.\u2019\u201d The guiding principle of the team was \u201cefficiency,\u201d one of the reasons\nwhy the game took just 10 months from start to finish to create. \u201cWe had to\nassume that this was a highly talented team who all trusted each other\u2019s work\nand opinions,\u201d Gray adds. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t much time for the fluffier side of\ncommunication.\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez Huerta doesn\u2019t recall it being a particularly\n\u201cclashy team\u201d but notes that everyone on it had had a \u201cvery high, critical\nmindset.\u201d\n\n(In 2019, a former employee at Mountains, the studio Wong cofounded after\nworking on Monument Valley, said that Wong had been emotionally abusive to\nstaff while working on the award-winning mobile game Florence, which was\npublished by Annapurna Interactive in 2018. Wong issued an apology. Ustwo team\nmembers I interviewed described a challenging work environment during Monument\nValley\u2019s development, but nothing that corresponded to Wong\u2019s later behavior\nwas reported.)\n\nGray recalls feeling intense self-imposed pressure. The eight-person team\nwanted to do justice to the acclaimed design work of their colleagues, but\nthey were aware of the fact that the unbridled creativity they\u2019d enjoyed\nlikely couldn\u2019t last\u2014there was only so much goodwill and funding their bosses\ncould offer. \u201cWe were this little renegade team that wasn\u2019t bringing in any\nmoney,\u201d he admits. \u201cWe pretty much only had one chance to make something\nbefore the team was probably going to get disbanded,\u201d either fired or absorbed\nback into the design agency.\n\nThe team pulled in one direction, which perhaps explains why there is such a\nthrilling coherence to Monument Valley. Its architectural puzzles exude the\nsolidity and control of an actual building, each mechanic built on another,\ngiving the whole structure strength, all while gently expanding the game\u2019s\nsuite of possibilities. There are no progress-halting difficulty spikes, and\nwhen a new interaction is introduced\u2014like doors that enable Ida to magically\ntraverse space or the ability for her to walk upside down and on walls\u2014you\nbarely even notice; such is their seamless integration. At times, Monument\nValley goes down so easy it can feel like a hallucination.\n\nThis was not the result of happenstance or even design genius but the\napplication of a philosophy used by ustwo\u2019s design team: The user is never\nwrong. In order to make good on the promise, accommodating the greatest number\nof players with a wide range of skills\u2014and giving them the best chance of\nactually completing the game, something famously few players actually do\u2014the\nteam adopted a rigorous and borderline obsessive approach to testing. It\nstarted with the approval of other team members; they\u2019d swivel their office\nchairs around to show work-in-progress material and then develop it further if\nit passed muster or can it if it didn\u2019t. Then they hit up their ustwo design\ncolleagues, a vast resource of what Anderson calls \u201cnormal people,\u201d that is,\nnon-gamers. They\u2019d grab, say, Paul from finance, a dad with a couple of kids\nwho played golf but didn\u2019t play games. They\u2019d jot down when the gratifying\nsounds of \u201coohs\u201d and \u201cahhs\u201d came and feed that back into the design,\nultimately eschewing the traditional approach of working from a design\ndocument in favor of something more fluid and intuitive, albeit rooted in the\nempiricism of user testing.\n\nFast-forward to April 2014, and the unorthodox approach paid off handsomely.\nWithin a month of its release, Monument Valley had secured the top spot in the\npaid app charts in more than 30 countries; it had become profitable in just a\nweek. Yet a portentous omen for premium mobile gaming loomed with the release\nof its expansion pack, Forgotten Shores, six months later. The expansion\nwhisked players off to a melancholic coastline bathed in mist, giving them\nanother hour of gameplay for the hardly bank-breaking cost of $1.99. Yet\nrather than celebrating the arrival of this additional adventure, many flocked\nto the App Store to leave one-star reviews. \u201cI expected the new chapters to be\nfree,\u201d wrote one player. \u201cSuch a rip off,\u201d complained another.\n\n\u201cIt was a sign of things to come,\u201d reflects Gray. \u201cWe\u2019ve trained consumers to\nexpect various things, and oftentimes that is a lot for not very much.\nSomething like Journey [roughly 90 minutes long, like Monument Valley] cost\n$14.99. Monument Valley was $3.99. We didn\u2019t pick that price because that\u2019s\nwhat we thought it was worth. We picked it because that\u2019s what we thought\nmobile players would pay, and we hoped the volume of sales would make up for\nit.\u201d Gray says it was \u201cdemoralizing\u201d to see players react like this, not least\nbecause he and the rest of the team were burned out after flinging themselves\ninto the DLC (while contributing to an Apple charity campaign) immediately\nafter finishing the game. \u201cBut at the time, we didn\u2019t blame the players,\u201d he\nadds. \u201cWe kind of collectively blamed the games industry for taking us to that\npoint\u2014that we have devalued art and culture so much that spending $1.99 on\nsomething that took a number of people six or seven months of their lives to\nmake is too much.\u201d\n\nJustJust under a decade later, on March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of\nJustice, alongside 16 state and district attorneys general, filed a landmark\nantitrust case against Apple, revolving around how the biggest of the five\nmajor tech companies was said to have used its locked-down iPhone ecosystem to\nbuild an illegal monopoly. The suit arrived hot on the heels of the Epic\nlawsuit against Apple, which took umbrage at, among other things, the 30\npercent cut Apple took of every financial transaction on the App Store.\n(Spotify, which owns The Ringer, was part of a group of companies supporting\nthe suit.) But the mere existence of the DOJ case arguably makes a more\npowerful argument than one filed by a competitor ever could.\n\nThe U.S. government, like many App Store users on both the consumer and\ndeveloper sides, has grown disillusioned and dissatisfied with the effects of\nApple\u2019s 65-70 percent share of the smartphone market. Ethan Gach, a senior\nreporter at Kotaku and author of the newsletter Dead Game, sees this backlash\nas reflective of a widespread sense that many of the things Apple\npromised\u2014functionality, a device that\u2019s \u201cnot throwing crap in your face\u201d\u2014have\nnot come to pass. He singles out the App Store, which was for so long the best\nplatform for a game like Monument Valley to make money on but in recent years\nhas descended into something akin to the cluttered Amazon Marketplace. \u201cYou\u2019re\njust sort of sifting through all this stuff,\u201d he says.\n\nOn the developer side, de Jongh has grown \u201cincreasingly frustrated\u201d with Apple\nas a \u201cgatekeeper,\u201d focusing particular ire on what he refers to as\n\u201cdiscoverability\u201d issues. He released two further games on iOS and Android\nafter 2017\u2019s Hidden Folks: Wurdweb, which was distributed via Apple\u2019s\nsubscription service, Apple Arcade, in 2021, and Secret Shuffle a year later.\nBut the situation has worsened so much for game makers such as him that he\ndescribes premium indie games on iOS in 2024 as effectively \u201cdead in the\nwater.\u201d It\u2019s a stark turn of events that the purchasing of premium mobile\ngames has gone from being something tens of millions of people do on a regular\nbasis to an act so rare that the closest analogue Orland can think of is a\nmusic fan buying an MP3. \u201cIt\u2019s reserved for this niche of people who are\nreally devoted to a market for art\u2019s sake,\u201d he says. \u201cThey want to support it\nmore than they want to get the best deal.\u201d\n\nDe Jongh points to a single date as the watershed: June 5, 2017, a handful of\nmonths after the release of Hidden Folks. That\u2019s when Apple introduced a\nredesign of the App Store. Before, says de Jongh, Apple \u201cfeatured\u201d a couple of\ntitles per week, promoting them to anyone across the entire globe who opened\nthe App Store. It was the \u201csingle biggest marketing beat\u201d for Hidden Folks,\nhelping the game earn just more than $50,000 on its very first day. Then, with\nthe redesign, the opportunity practically vanished. iPhone users had to\nnavigate to a different tab to see new games. In de Jongh\u2019s view, this was a\nfundamental and ultimately fatal layer of friction.\n\nFelix Bohatsch, cofounder of Broken Rules, the Austrian studio behind 2017\u2019s\nOld Man\u2019s Journey (which managed to secure a feature on the App Store just two\nweeks before the redesign), sees it the same way. \u201cThe amount of eyeballs we\ngot was amazing,\u201d Bohatsch says. \u201cWhat made it even more valuable is that we\ngot eyeballs from people from all kinds of cultures, all kinds of backgrounds,\nall around the world, and not only gamers.\u201d His studio released a follow-up,\nthe musical puzzle game Eloh, a year later under the new conditions, securing\nfeatured placements within the \u201cnew games\u201d tab and even winning an Apple\nDesign Award. But the game didn\u2019t break through in the same way. \u201cNone of\nthose events had as much of an impact on sales numbers,\u201d he says. \u201cEven if I\nunderstand some of the intentions behind the redesign, it was clear that\ndiscoverability was much worse.\u201d\n\nWithout making it sound like the moon landing, the App Store from the early\n2010s to 2017 offered something close to a gaming utopia. Experimental and\nexpressive titles found their way to audiences that were genuinely mainstream\nin their size and demographics. These games could hold their own against those\nwhose core gameplay loops weren\u2019t always designed according to the most\nethical of principles. But, de Jongh says, alongside the App Store redesign,\nsomething else changed at Apple. The recommendations of indie gems started to\ndry up, supplanted by plugs for sports titles, branded titles (which mobile\ndevelopers have increasingly turned to), and, of course, free-to-play\ngoliaths, the \u201cstuff that just makes money.\u201d Gaming on the iPhone, previously\na breath of fresh air, began to feel stale: Rather than inspiring emotions\nsuch as wonder and calm, as Monument Valley does, the titles that dominated\nthis new era of the App Store were more likely to leave players with a sense\nof shame and guilt. Now, in 2024, it\u2019s clear that Monument Valley is\nemblematic of a creative golden age for mobile games, albeit one that has been\nunequivocally consigned to history. The future it pointed to has fizzled\nout\u2014little more than a faded dream, and maybe a naive one at that.\n\nGach describes a \u201cdereliction of duty\u201d on Apple\u2019s part in the way it \u201callowed\nthe worst things to flourish,\u201d not least because it appears to him, in\nhindsight at least, as though Apple was cynically leveraging premium titles\nlike the Apple Design Award\u2013winning Monument Valley to build the iPhone\u2019s\nreputation in the 2010s. \u201cAt the time, it felt like Apple was trying to\npromote these sorts of games as part of the brand of the App Store\u2014like, \u2018Come\nhere for quality things that you won\u2019t see anywhere else\u2019\u2014and in the years\nsince, it\u2019s been clear that this has atrophied,\u201d Gach says. In his view,\nthere\u2019s perhaps no greater (or more ironic) indictment of what happened to\ngaming on the App Store than the very existence of Apple Arcade, the\nsubscription service many, including Gray, viewed as an attempt to save\npremium-style games. But, the new storefront, says Gach, is just another\nwalled garden within a much larger one, or \u201ca little App Store within the App\nStore where none of the other garbage is.\u201d\n\nEven Apple Arcade has sputtered. It burst onto the scene in 2019 with a\ngenerous slate of games from an all-star lineup of studios, including Simogo\n(Sayonara Wild Hearts), Dinosaur Polo Club (Mini Motorways), and, naturally,\nustwo (Assemble With Care). But in 2020, the service reportedly pivoted\n(canceling contracts in the process) from one-and-done premium-esque titles to\n\u201csticky\u201d games, that is, those with high replay value. Last month, another\nreport alleged the \u201csmell of death\u201d around the service. De Jongh, who also\nhelps fund indie games, hasn\u2019t heard of a single title that has signed to\nApple Arcade in the past year. \u201cEither they\u2019re going to radically shift\ndirection again, make their minds up about it, or the whole thing is going to\nget killed,\u201d he says.\n\n### Sign up for the The Ringer Newsletter\n\nRegardless, Gray sees a logic baked into the subscription service that makes\nit susceptible to the same kind of forces that have afflicted the App Store:\n\u201cAt the end of the day, they\u2019ve created subscription platforms to make people\nsubscribe for months in a row,\u201d he says, noting how retention-based games\n\u201caren\u2019t a million miles away\u201d from their free-to-play counterparts: \u201cYou\u2019re\njust taking the monetization out of the equation\u2014it still has to last\nforever.\u201d\n\nA decade on, Monument Valley feels emblematic, in a way that stretches beyond\ngaming, of a time when digital culture and media still had an opportunity to\nchart a different course. The battle that Orland speaks of, waged between\nartistic games and glorified slot machines \u201cwith pretty lights and randomized\nrewards,\u201d was really a battle for the \u201cbetter angels of our nature.\u201d Ten years\nlater, it feels as if those angels have been decisively crushed (or maybe they\njust logged off). To varying degrees, we\u2019ve all been pulled deeper into the\n\u201cmachine zone,\u201d hooked on social media, short-form video, dating apps, on-\ndemand television, and, of course, free-to-play games (microtransactions make\nup some 98 percent of all mobile revenue). There have been corresponding\ndeclines in the amount of sex we\u2019re having and our levels of happiness. For\nthe writer Magdalene J. Taylor, there is a clear culprit: \u201cIt\u2019s obviously the\nphones.\u201d\n\nBut this is too simple a diagnosis, making a scapegoat out of our screens.\nPerhaps more accurate is Gray\u2019s contention that \u201cwe got too good at\ncapitalizing [on] people\u2019s attention.\u201d He\u2019s talking about how the video game\nindustry has married compulsive interactive design with an economic system\nthat profits as people spend ever-rising amounts of time with machines, but he\nmight as well be referring to pretty much any subsector of tech. This is the\nlandscape into which ustwo Games will at some unspecified point release\nMonument Valley 3, about which scant details exist beyond the identity of its\ndirector, Jennifer Estaris. Gray does, however, divulge that the game will\nmake concessions to players\u2019 increasingly voracious appetites for sheer\ncontent by lengthening the experience while taking pains to preserve and\nexpand the original\u2019s distinct vision. Monument Valley 3, then, will move with\nthe times, but perhaps not too much.\n\nGray admits there is something fundamentally \u201cweird,\u201d and maybe even uncanny,\nabout such an endeavor in 2024. \u201cIt almost feels like a glimpse into a\nparallel existence,\u201d he says. \u201cOne where we didn\u2019t optimize for analytics,\nmonetization, and attention capturing, but one where, somehow, as an industry,\nwe optimized for quality and beauty instead.\u201d\n\nLewis Gordon is a writer and journalist living in Glasgow who contributes to\noutlets including The Verge, Wired, and Vulture.\n\nTV\n\n### HBO Shows on Netflix.
