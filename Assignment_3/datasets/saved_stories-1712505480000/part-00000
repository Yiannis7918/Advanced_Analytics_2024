This will be followed by a period of lead ion\ncollisions in October.\n\nBefore the LHC could restart, each accelerator in the CERN complex had to be\nprepared for another year of physics data taking. Beginning with Linac4, which\nwelcomed its first beam two months ago, each accelerator has gone through a\nphase of beam commissioning in which it is gradually set up and optimised to\nbe able to control all aspects of the beam, from its energy and intensity to\nits size and stability. During this phase researchers also test the\naccelerator\u2019s performance and address any issues before it is used for\nphysics. Following Linac4, which contains the source of protons for the beam,\neach accelerator was commissioned in turn: the Proton Synchrotron Booster, the\nProton Synchrotron, the Super Proton Synchrotron, and finally the LHC from 8\nMarch until 5 April. The whole complex is now ready for data taking.\n\nBack to the CCC. While stable beams are the goal, the CCC engineers must first\ntake several steps to achieve them. First, they must inject the beams into the\nLHC from the previous accelerators in the chain. Then begins the ramp-up\nprocess, which involves increasing the beam energy up to the nominal energy of\n6.8 TeV. The next step \u2013 shown as \u201cflat top\u201d on LHC Page 1 \u2013 is where the\nenergy in the beams is consistent, but they\u2019re not quite ready yet. In order\nto achieve stable beams, the circulating beams must then be \u201csqueezed\u201d and\nadjusted using the LHC magnets. This involves making the beams narrower and\nmore centred on their paths, and therefore more likely to produce a high\nnumber of collisions in the detectors. Only after the squeezing and adjustment\nhas been completed can stable beams be declared and the experiments around the\nLHC begin their data taking.\n\nWatch a video explaining the process from first injection to stable beams:\n\nDelphine Jacquet and Georges Trad, both engineers in charge of the LHC,\nexplain how the LHC beams work from the injections of protons to stable beams.\n(Video: CERN)Did you know?Although the solar eclipse on 8 April will not\naffect the beams in the LHC, the gravitational pull of the moon, like the\ntides, changes the shape of the LHC because the machine is so big.
