Both in its assertion and its slightly pedestrian\nprose, it typifies Isaac Asimov, who has died in New York aged 72. He was an\nindustrious and engaged man whose clear belief in scientific method led him to\ndevour many sciences in the way most of us get through meals.\n\nAsimov was born in Petrovich, Russia, in 1920. His Russian Jewish parents\nemigrated to the United States when he was three. Legend has it that it was in\nhis father's candy store he came across science fiction magazines. His first\nSF story was published in 1938. He was as precocious as he was productive.\n\nJohn W. Campbell, another prodigy, was then editing Astounding, which later\nbecame Analog. Asimov's early fame is associated with Campbell, a great\ndriving force in inspiring his writers with new ideas. Campbell was the\ninspiration behind Asimov's Three Laws Of Robotics. Between them they coined\nthe term 'robotics', which is still in use. Asimov's robot stories ran first\nin Astounding, culminating in one of his most brilliant novels, The Naked Sun\n(1956), a hybrid of SF and detection.\n\nAstronomy is, or certainly was, the science inspiring most SF writers. When\none had read all the astronomy books in the library, one perforce turned to\nthe fiction as second best.\n\nAsimov's most famous short story is Nightfall (1941), firmly based on\nastronomical phenomena. Weak on characterisation, it has great lighting\neffects. Astronomy again fuelled the work for which Asimov is most famous,\ngenerally known as The Foundation Trilogy, first brought to book in 1964. The\nfirst story on which the trilogy builds, Foundation, ran in Astounding in\n1942. It was immediately acclaimed. The trilogy portrays a future galaxy over\nwhich a predicted 10,000 years of barbarism is about to descend. A lowly\nfoundation, established at one end of the galaxy, will keep civilisation\nalight, propelled onward by the psychohistory of Hari Seldon.\n\n'Psychohistory' is a way of predicting future outcomes of events by large\nstatistical reference. Rather like all the polls currently clarifying - or\notherwise - our thinking on the election. Hari Seldon returns from the dead\nevery so often to prompt his project on its way, just as we may imagine Asimov\nwill contrive to do.\n\nThe Foundation stories earned Asimov about two cents a word on their first\nappearance. By now, they have probably earned him several thousand dollars a\nword so often have they been reprinted in so many countries. The Foundation\nseries has been voted the most popular SF book ever written (not counting\nhaute sf from the likes of Orwell, Huxley and Burgess). For readers\neverywhere, these novels have probably served as inspiring introductions to\nfuture worlds, larger lives, and greater issues.\n\nWhen SF went modern in the Sixties with a revolt into style Asimov was upset.\nIt was only in the eighties that he began to write SF consistently again, with\nrather ponderous continuations of his old Foundation series. Foundation's Edge\n(1982) began the solemn march. Meanwhile, the march towards an enduring place\nin The Guinness Book Of Records proceded elsewhere. Isaac Asimov is one of the\ncentury's great popularisers of science. In this, he rivals HG Wells. All his\nwriting in the scientific field is enlightened and enjoyable; in this respect,\nthere is no one to take his place.\n\nEccentricity showed every now and again in the unrolling asimovian canon. It\nwas widely hold that Asimov's Guide to the Bible (1968-69) and Asimov's Guide\nto Shakespeare (1970) - not to mention The Sensuous Dirty Old Man (1971) -\nwere overdoing things somewhat.\n\nHowever, every man likes to think of himself as human and humorous, even when\nhis mountain of books, by now numbering more than 500, shows him to be in some\nrespects monstrous. Asimov lived in an apartment overlooking Central Park in\nNew York and worked with the blinds down so as not to be distracted. He seemed\nto live much of his life hidden behind word-processor and computer.\n\nUnlike Heinlein, at one time regarded as Asimov's rival, he showed a broad\nhumanistic streak and always interested himself in other SF writers. His\nopposition to the sixties New Wave is long behind him. He did once threaten to\nsue me, over something I had erroneously written about his connection with the\nmagazine bearing his name. I apologised, and received a good-natured letter in\nreply. He knew that life is difficult 'out there', as much for science fiction\nwriters as for human beings. In the SF and fantasy field, which for some\nreason tends to breed talented Calibans, Asimov was a most admirable monster.\n\nAlthough his death is saddening, it comes as no surprise. Doris Lessing said\nthat hearing the news was like learning that the Taj Mahal had collapsed.\nAsimov had been ailing for some while after several heart operations. He\nleaves behind a widow, Janet Jeppson, a psychiatrist who has also written\nscience fiction. The last words in his volume, Asimov On Science Fiction\n(1981), have a sober and valedictory ring: 'If you want to be a prolific\nwriter, you have to be a single-minded, driven, non-stop person. Sounds\nhorrible, doesn't it? Well, then, concentrate on being a good writer, and\nleave prolific for those poor souls who can't help it.'\n\nIsaac Asimov, born January 2, 1920; died April 6, 1992\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Books\n  * Isaac Asimov\n  * obituaries\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Books\n  * Music\n  * TV & radio\n  * Art & design\n  * Film\n  * Games\n  * Classical\n  * Stage\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
