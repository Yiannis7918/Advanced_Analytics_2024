This trend points to a broad global decline in\nreligious affiliation and identity. The United States has seen one of the\nbiggest drops: the share of its residents who said they belonged to a church,\nsynagogue, or mosque fell from 70 percent in 1999 to 47 percent in 2020,\naccording to Gallup.\n\nOne potential factor is the proliferation of artificial intelligence and\nrobotics, according to a team of researchers led by Chicago Booth\u2019s Joshua\nConrad Jackson and Northwestern\u2019s Adam Waytz. The more exposed people are to\nautomation technologies, the researchers find, the weaker their religious\nbeliefs. They argue that the relationship is not coincidental and that \u201cthere\nare meaningful properties of automation which encourage religious decline.\u201d\n\nResearchers and philosophers have pondered the connection between science and\nreligion for many years. The German sociologist Max Weber spoke of science\ncontributing to the \u201cdisenchantment of the world,\u201d or the replacement of\nsupernatural explanations for the workings of the universe with rational,\nscientific ones. Evidence from prior research doesn\u2019t support a strong\n\u201cdisenchantment\u201d effect, Jackson says, but he and his coresearchers suggest\nthat AI and robotics may influence people\u2019s beliefs in a way that science more\ngenerally does not.\n\nTo explore the link between automation and religion, the researchers gathered\ndata at the national, regional, organizational, and individual levels. They\ncombined survey data on the importance of religion with information on the use\nof industrial robots to compare the populations of 68 countries over the years\n2006\u201319. They controlled for factors such as per capita GDP, population size,\nand exposure to other technologies. The researchers find that countries with a\nlarge stock of robots\u20141 standard deviation above average\u2014experienced a 3\npercent decline in religiosity each decade. By contrast, countries with a\nstock 1 standard deviation below average experienced a slight uptick in\nreligiosity.\n\nThey also looked at members of a single community who self-reported\ninformation about their religious beliefs and their jobs at various points\nover time. Using an occupational database that indicated the importance of\nprogramming to various professional roles\u2014a proxy for AI exposure\u2014the\nresearchers find that people whose jobs were 1 standard deviation higher than\naverage in exposure to AI were 45 percent less likely to believe in God than\nthose with average exposure. Further, because they were able to follow\nresponses over time, they observed how a person\u2019s career path and religious\nfeelings changed from survey to survey.\n\n## Losing their religion\n\nCountries* where workers had more exposure to robots tended to experience a\ndecline in religiosity, the research finds.\n\n\u201cOccupational AI exposure explained variation in religious belief across\nindividuals, but also religious decline in the same individual over time,\u201d the\nresearchers write.\n\nTwo other studies\u2014one comparing religiosity and the stock of industrial robots\nacross US metropolitan areas and the other exploring the relationship between\noccupational exposure to AI and religious attitudes and practices among\nemployees of a manufacturing plant that was integrating AI technology\u2014both\nsupported the link between automation and religious decline.\n\nIn a follow-up experiment, the researchers asked participants to read about\neither three advances in AI technology or three non-AI scientific\ndevelopments. The participants then rated how impressive and technologically\nadvanced each discovery was, and also how much it affected the strength of\ntheir religious faith. Reading about AI had a stronger negative effect on\nparticipants\u2019 religious convictions than reading about other kinds of\nbreakthroughs, even when the breakthroughs were judged as equally impressive.\n\nAutomation\u2019s impact on religious faith may have to do with what the\nresearchers call the \u201cinstrumental\u201d value of religion. \u201cHistorically, people\nhave deferred to supernatural agents and religious professionals to solve\ninstrumental problems beyond the scope of human ability,\u201d they write. \u201cThese\nproblems may seem more solvable for people working and living in highly\nautomated spaces.\u201d\n\nJackson and his coresearchers note that apart from its instrumental value,\nreligion also plays a role in defining morality. Whether people ultimately\nconsider automation a suitable substitute for religion in performing that\nfunction is an open question. They point out that people are currently\nunlikely to trust AI with moral decision-making, but this trust may grow over\ntime.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nJoshua Conrad Jackson, Kai Chi Yam, Pok Man Tang, Chris G.
