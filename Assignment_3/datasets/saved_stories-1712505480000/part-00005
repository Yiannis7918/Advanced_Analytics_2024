Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n# ChatGPT might get its own dedicated personal AI device \u2013 with Jony Ive's\nhelp\n\nNews\n\nBy David Nield\n\npublished 14 hours ago\n\nBut it's not a smartphone\n\nThe new device may resemble the Humane AI Pin (Image credit: Humane)\n\nSam Altman, the CEO of ChatGPT developer OpenAI, is reportedly seeking funding\nfor an AI-powered, personal device \u2013 perhaps not unlike the Humane AI Pin \u2013\nand ex-Apple design guru Jony Ive is apparently getting involved as well.\n\nThis is as per The Information (via MacRumors), and the rumor is that Altman\nand Ive have started a \"mysterious company\" together to make the device a\nreality. The report doesn't mention much about the hardware, except to say it\nwon't look like a smartphone.\n\nAs we've seen with the Humane AI Pin and the Rabbit R1, having an AI assistant\nrunning on a device means you don't necessarily need a display and traditional\napps \u2013 the artificial intelligence engine can do everything for you, no\ntapping or scrolling required.\n\nAltman and Ive are said to be seeking around $1 billion in funding, so this is\nclearly a major undertaking we're talking about. It's not clear how much\ninvolvement OpenAI would have, but its ChatGPT bot would most likely be used\non the new device.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM techradar\n\n## Previous rumors\n\nChatGPT could find itself in a new device (Image credit: Shutterstock/Daniel\nChetroni)\n\nThis hasn't come completely out of the blue: back in September The Financial\nTimes reported that Altman and Ive were \"in talks\" to get funding for a new\nproject from SoftBank, a Japanese investment company.\n\nSoftBank has a stake in CPU company Arm, which might be tapped to provide\ncomponents for the hardware \u2013 which can't run entirely on AI cloud magic of\ncourse. All this is speculation for the time being, however.\n\nIn January, Sam Altman was spotted touring around a Samsung chip factory, so\nall the indications are that he's planning something in terms of physical\nhardware. It remains to be seen just how advanced this hardware is though.\n\n## Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\n\nGet the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion,\nanalysis and more from the TechRadar team.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nDuring his time with Apple, Jony Ive led the design teams responsible for the\niPod, iPhone, iPad and MacBook, so whatever is in the pipeline, we can expect\nit to look stylish.
