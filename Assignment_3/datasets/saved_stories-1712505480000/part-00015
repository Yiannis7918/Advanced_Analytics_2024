They recorded the largest\njump in temperature ever measured at a meteorological centre on Earth.\nAccording to their instruments, the region that day experienced a rise of\n38.5C above its seasonal average: a world record.\n\nThis startling leap \u2013 in the coldest place on the planet \u2013 left polar\nresearchers struggling for words to describe it. \u201cIt is simply mind-boggling,\u201d\nsaid Prof Michael Meredith, science leader at the British Antarctic Survey.\n\u201cIn sub-zero temperatures such a massive leap is tolerable but if we had a 40C\nrise in the UK now that would take temperatures for a spring day to over 50C \u2013\nand that would be deadly for the population.\u201d\n\nThis amazement was shared by glaciologist Prof Martin Siegert, of the\nUniversity of Exeter. \u201cNo one in our community thought that anything like this\ncould ever happen. It is extraordinary and a real concern,\u201d he told the\nObserver. \u201cWe are now having to wrestle with something that is completely\nunprecedented.\u201d\n\nPoleward winds, which previously made few inroads into the atmosphere above\nAntarctica, are now carrying more and more warm, moist air from lower\nlatitudes \u2013 including Australia \u2013 deep into the continent, say scientists, and\nthese have been blamed for the dramatic polar \u201cheatwave\u201d that hit Concordia.\nExactly why these currents are now able to plunge so deep into the continent\u2019s\nair space is not yet clear, however.\n\nNor has this huge temperature hike turned out to be an isolated event,\nscientists have discovered. For the past two years they have been inundated\nwith rising numbers of reports of disturbing meteorological anomalies on the\ncontinent. Glaciers bordering the west Antarctic ice-sheet are losing mass to\nthe ocean at an increasing rate, while levels of sea ice, which float on the\noceans around the continent, have plunged dramatically, having remained stable\nfor more than a century.\n\nThese events have raised fears that the Antarctic, once thought to be too cold\nto experience the early impacts of global warming, is now succumbing\ndramatically and rapidly to the swelling levels of greenhouse gases that\nhumans continue to pump into the atmosphere.\n\nThese dangers were highlighted by a team of scientists, led by Will Hobbs of\nthe University of Tasmania, in a paper that was published last week in the\nJournal of Climate. After examining recent changes in sea ice coverage in\nAntarctica, the group concluded there had been an \u201cabrupt critical transition\u201d\nin the continent\u2019s climate that could have repercussions for both local\nAntarctic ecosystems and the global climate system.\n\n\u201cThe extreme lows in Antarctic sea ice have led researchers to suggest that a\nregime shift is under way in the Southern Ocean, and we found multiple lines\nof evidence that support such a shift to a new sea ice state,\u201d said Hobbs.\n\nThe dramatic nature of this transformation was emphasised by Meredith.\n\u201cAntarctic sea ice coverage actually increased slightly in the late 20th and\nearly 21st century. However, in the middle of the last decade it fell off a\ncliff. It is a harbinger of the new ground with the Antarctic climate system,\nand that could be very troubling for the region and for the rest of the\nplanet.\u201d\n\nThe continent is now catching up with the Arctic, where the impacts of global\nwarming have, until now, been the most intense experienced across the planet,\nadded Siegert. \u201cThe Arctic is currently warming at four times the rate\nexperienced by the rest of the planet. But the Antarctic has started to catch\nup, so that it is already warming twice as quickly as the planet overall.\u201d\n\nA key reason for the Arctic and Antarctic to be taking disproportionate hits\nfrom global warming is because the Earth\u2019s oceans \u2013 warmed by fossil-fuel\nburning \u2013 are losing their sea ice at their polar extremities. The dark waters\nthat used to lie below the ice are being exposed and solar radiation is no\nlonger reflected back into space. Instead, it is being absorbed by the sea,\nfurther heating the oceans there.\n\n\u201cEssentially, it is a vicious circle of warming oceans and melting of sea ice,\nthough the root cause is humanity and its continuing burning of fossil fuels\nand its production of greenhouse gases,\u201d said Meredith. \u201cThis whole business\nhas to be laid at our door.\u201d\n\nIce cover in Antarctica has been eroding at an alarming rate due to global\nwarming caused by burning fossil fuels.

If all the ice on Antarctica were to melt, this\nwould raise sea levels around the globe by more than 60 metres. Islands and\ncoastal zones where much of the world\u2019s population now have homes would be\ninundated.\n\nSuch an apocalypse is unlikely to occur for some time, however. Antarctica\u2019s\nice sheet covers 14m square kilometres (about 5.4m square miles), roughly the\narea of the United States and Mexico combined, and contains about 30m cubic\nkilometres (7.2m cubic miles) of ice \u2013 about 60% of the world\u2019s fresh water.\nThis vast covering hides a mountain range that is nearly as high as the Alps,\nso it will take a very long time for that to melt completely, say scientists.\n\nNevertheless, there is now a real danger that some significant sea level rises\nwill occur in the next few decades as the ice sheets and glaciers of west\nAntarctica continue to shrink. These are being eroded at their bases by\nwarming ocean water and could disintegrate in a few decades. If they disappear\nentirely, that would raise sea levels by 5m \u2013 sufficient to cause damage to\ncoastal populations around the world. How quickly that will happen is\ndifficult to assess. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said\nthat sea levels are likely to rise between 0.3m to 1.1m by the end of the\ncentury. Many experts now fear this is a dangerous underestimate. In the past,\nclimate change deniers accused scientists of exaggerating the threat of global\nwarming. However, the evidence that is now emerging from Antarctica and other\nparts of the world makes it very clear that scientists did not exaggerate.\nIndeed, they very probably underrated by a considerable degree the threat that\nnow faces humanity.\n\n\u201cThe picture is further confused in Antarctica because, historically, we have\nhad problems getting data,\u201d added Meredith. \u201cWe have never had the information\nabout weather and ecosystem, compared with the data we get from the rest of\nthe world, because the continent is so remote and so hostile. Our records are\ncomparatively short and that means that the climate models we have created,\nalthough very capable, are based on sparse data. They cannot capture all of\nthe physics, chemistry and biology. They can make predictions that are\ncoherent but they cannot capture the sort of extremes that we\u2019re now beginning\nto observe.\u201d\n\nThe woes facing Antarctica are not merely of human concern, however. \u201cWe are\nalready seeing serious ecological impacts that threaten to spread through the\nfood chain,\u201d said Prof Kate Hendry, a chemical oceanographer based at the\nBritish Antarctic Survey.\n\nA critical example is provided by the algae which grow under and around sea\nice in west Antarctica. This is starting to disappear, with very serious\nimplications, added Hendry. Algae is eaten by krill, the tiny marine\ncrustaceans that are one of the most abundant animals on Earth and which\nprovide food for predators that include fish, penguins, seals and whales. \u201cIf\nkrill starts to disappear in the wake of algae, then all sorts of disruption\nto the food chain will occur,\u201d said Hendry.\n\nThe threat posed by the disappearance of krill goes deeper, however. They play\na key role in limiting global warming. Algae absorb carbon dioxide. Krill then\neat them and excrete it, the faeces sinking to the seabed and staying there.\nDecreased levels of algae and krill would then mean less carbon from the\natmosphere would be deposited on the ocean floor and would instead remain near\nthe sea surface, where it would return to the atmosphere.\n\n\u201cThey act like a conveyor belt that takes carbon out of the atmosphere and\ncarries it down to the deep ocean floor where it can be locked away. So if we\nstart messing with that system, there could be all sorts of other knock-on\neffects for our attempts to cope with the impact of global warming,\u201d added\nHendry. \u201cIt is a scary scenario. Nevertheless that, unfortunately, is what we\nare now facing.\u201d\n\nAnother victim of the sudden, catastrophic warming that has gripped the\ncontinent is its most famous resident: the emperor penguin. Last year the\nspecies, which is found only in Antarctica, suffered a catastrophic breeding\nfailure because the platforms of sea ice on which they are born started to\nbreak up long before the young penguins could grow waterproof feathers.\n\n\u201cWe have never seen emperor penguins fail to breed, at this scale, in a single\nseason,\u201d said Peter Fretwell, of the British Antarctic Survey. \u201cThe loss of\nsea ice in this region during the Antarctic summer made it very unlikely that\ndisplaced chicks would survive.\u201d\n\nResearchers say that the discovery of the loss of emperor penguins suggests\nthat more than 90% of colonies will be wiped out by the end of the century, if\nglobal warming trends continue at their current disastrous rate. \u201cThe chicks\ncannot live on sea ice until they have fledged,\u201d said Meredith. \u201cAfter that,\nthey can look after themselves. But the sea ice is breaking up before they\nreach that stage and mass drowning events are now happening. Colonies of\npenguins are being wiped out. And that\u2019s a tragedy. This is an iconic species,\none that is emblematic of Antarctica and the new vulnerability of its\necosystems.\u201d\n\nThe crisis facing the continent has widespread implications. More than 40\nnations are signatories of the Antarctic Treaty\u2019s environmental protocol,\nwhich is supposed to shield it from a host of different threats, with habitat\ndegradation being one of the most important. The fact that the continent is\nnow undergoing alarming shifts in its ice covering, eco-systems and climate is\na clear sign that this protection is no longer being provided.\n\n\u201cThe cause of this ecological and meteorological change lies outside the\ncontinent,\u201d added Siegert. \u201cIt is being caused because the rest of the world\nis continuing to emit vast amounts carbon dioxide.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, there is a good case for arguing that if countries are\nknowingly polluting the atmosphere with greenhouse gases, and Antarctica is\nbeing affected as a consequence, then the treaty protocol is being breached by\nits signatories and their behaviour could be challenged on legal and political\ngrounds. It should certainly make for some challenging meetings at the UN in\nthe coming years.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Climate crisis\n  * The Observer\n  * Antarctica\n  * Climate science\n  * Animals\n  * Wildlife\n  * Global research\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Comments (...)\n\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * UK\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Ukraine\n  * Environment\n  * Science\n  * Global development\n  * Football\n  * Tech\n  * Business\n  * Obituaries\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
