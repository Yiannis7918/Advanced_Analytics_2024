This perspective doesn't see AI as a\nlevel playing field, but rather as a turbocharger for those already racing\nahead. Imagine a world not where David and Goliath both get slingshots, but\nwhere Goliath gets a slingshot that fires at the speed of sound. The premise\nis simple yet profound: AI, in its majestic potential, could indeed amplify\ndisparities rather than bridging them.\n\nTake, for instance, the idea of AI as a force multiplier - a concept borrowed\nfrom military strategy to describe how technology can increase (or multiply)\nthe effectiveness of a unit. In the hands of a skilled developer or artist, AI\ncan turn what would be a week's work into an hour's. Now, apply a 100x\nmultiplier. For the adept, it's the difference between creating at a scale of\n1 million versus a hopeful amateur's 10,000. The numbers aren't just stark;\nthey're a chasm, widening with every AI-assisted leap and bound.\n\nThis scenario doesn't just apply to raw output but extends to quality,\ninnovation, and the very essence of creativity. While novices fiddle with the\nbasics, professionals harness AI to explore uncharted territories, pushing\nboundaries far beyond the novice's grasp. The AI doesn't just work; it\ncollaborates, becoming an intellectual sparring partner for those who speak\nits language fluently. The dialogue between a master and AI can reach\nsymphonic levels, while others struggle to tune their instruments.\n\nOf course, this reflection isn't a surrender to dystopia but a call to\nacknowledge the potential disparities AI could exacerbate. There's a seductive\nsimplicity in believing technology alone can dismantle decades, if not\ncenturies, of accumulated advantage. Yet, without conscious effort to bridge\nthis gap - through education, policy, and inclusive design - AI could indeed\nbecome the exclusive amplification of those already ahead, leaving others to\nmarvel at the distance from afar.\n\nIn the end, the narrative of AI as a universal leveler may need revision. It's\nnot that the Goliaths of the world will use AI to crush the Davids; rather,\nthey'll sprint so far ahead that the race itself changes. As we stand on the\nbrink of this potential future, the challenge isn't just to harness AI but to\ndo so in a way that brings everyone along for the ride. The alternative is a\nworld where the gap between \"can\" and \"cannot\" isn't just wide but, for all\npractical intents and purposes, insurmountable.\n\n  * Is it just about customer support\n\nIs the realm of conversational AI confined to just solving our problems after\nwe've committed to a product or service?
