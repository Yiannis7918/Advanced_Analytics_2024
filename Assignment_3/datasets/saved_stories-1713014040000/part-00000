Case in point: Redditor gthing has describes how they\nequipped the Anbernic RG353V with a keyboard and Ubuntu Linux to turn into a\npocket terminal called the AnberDeck.\n\ngthing\u2019s AnberDeck\n\nFirst launched in the fall of 2022, the Anbernic RG353V/S currently sells for\naround $74 and up at AliExpress or for $88 and up if you order one from the\nAnbernic website. The 126 x 83 x 21mm (5\u2032\u2032 x 3.3\u2032\u2032 x 0.8\u2032\u2032) handheld comes\nwith 1 to 2GB of LPDDR4 memory, up to 32GB of eMMC storage, a microSD card\nreader, a 3,200 mAh battery, and support for WiFi 5 and Bluetooth 4.2.\n\nTo turn the handheld game console into a pocket terminal, gthing replaced the\ndefault software with ArkOS, an Ubuntu 19.10-based operating system with an\nemphasis on gaming, modified a 3D printed case design for the RG353 to\naccommodate a keyboard, and then affixed a BlackBerry 9900 keyboard + case to\nthe front.\n\nUnfortunately, like the BBQ20KBD we wrote about last year, this is a wired\nkeyboard. And since the USB port is on top of the keyboard, most USB cables\nwill block a portion of the screen, although gthing notes that it might be\npossible to hook up with a low-profile USB cable that can run behind the\nkeyboard. A Bluetooth keyboard might also work.\n\nOverall this is a pretty nifty DIY project to repurpose a handheld game\nconsole as a pocket-sized Linux terminal. But it\u2019s not necessarily the most\nelegant solution: the finished product ends up being very thick thanks to a\ncase that covers the Anbernic RG353V/S controllers and a keyboard that sits on\ntop of the case.\n\ngthing\u2019s AnberDeckgthing\u2019s AnberDeckgthing\u2019s AnberDeck\n\nvia Hackster.io\n\n## Support Liliputing\n\nLiliputing's primary sources of revenue are advertising and affiliate links\n(if you click the \"Shop\" button at the top of the page and buy something on\nAmazon, for example, we'll get a small commission).\n\nBut there are several ways you can support the site directly even if you're\nusing an ad blocker* and hate online shopping.\n\n### Contribute to our Patreon campaign\n\nor...\n\n### Contribute via PayPal\n\n* If you are using an ad blocker like uBlock Origin and seeing a pop-up message at the bottom of the screen, we have a guide that may help you disable it.\n\n## Subscribe to Liliputing via Email\n\nJoin 9,543 other subscribers\n\nTagged: anberdeck, anbernic, anbernic rg353, anbernic rg353vs, cyberdeck, diy,\nlinux, pocket terminal\n\n## Join the Conversation\n\n3 Comments\n\nCancel reply\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

Chris K says:\n\n04/12/2024 at 3:55 PM\n\nYou know... Anbernic cranks out new devices like crazy, almost to the point\nwhere they\u2019re competing against themselves as much as they are other\ncompanies.\n\nI wonder if they\u2019d ever consider releasing a purpose-built like this\u2013basically\none of their vertical game handhelds but with an integrated Blackberry-style\nkeyboard? That would be a spiffy little Linux terminal, or even good for some\nDOS emulation. And nobody else is making something similar, certainly not with\nAnbernic\u2019s build quality.\n\nReply\n\n    1. Michael says:\n\n04/12/2024 at 9:54 PM\n\nYeah, I reckon Anbernic could make a pretty compelling low cost Linux\nterminal. Either a \u201ccyberdeck\u201d (kind of like the hacked device in this\narticle, a small clam-shell or a touchscreen-only tablet style device. If they\ncould get a decent screen size and battery life and still keep a sharp price,\nthen I would definitely be interested.\n\nReply\n\n## Follow\n\n## Recent Posts\n\n  * AnberDeck mod turns Anbernic RG353V game system into a handheld Linux terminal\n\n  * A new RK3588 processor module lets you upgrade the MNT Reform laptop (modular, open hardware)\n\n  * MINISFORUM UM690 Pro is a Ryzen 9 6900HX mini PC for $349 and up\n\n## Latest Deals\n\n  * Daily Deals (4-12-2024)\n\nDisclosure: Some links on this page may be monetized by Skimlinks and Amazon's\nand eBay's affiliate programs.\n\n\u00a9 2024 Liliputing.
