Exploring Laravel Octane for Performance Boost\n\n## 1\\. Utilising Jobs and Queues\n\nTo handle the increased load on your Laravel application, leveraging jobs and\nqueues with Laravel Horizon and Redis is crucial.\n\nBy efficiently managing tasks asynchronously, you can improve application\nresponsiveness and scalability. Instead of waiting for all the process to be\ndone, you can reply with a 201 HTTP Status and do everything in the\nbackground.\n\nIn MetricsWave, for example, every time that we receive a new event or visits\nwe are storing it in redis, and, in the background, making all the process to\nstore that visit in a proper way. The user doesn\u2019t need to wait for it.\n\nAdditionally, scaling workers based on the workload it\u2019s easier than scaling\nthe whole application. You can have all the workers you need in the background\ndoing all the job.\n\n## 2\\. Optimising Code for Performance\n\nThis sounds obvious but is not. You have to take care of your code, you can\nuse tools like Sentry or Laravel Debugbar to see what are the slowest points\nand with the most options for improvement.\n\nOne of the most common bottlenecks in Laravel are the N+1 query issue.\n\nMost of the time, solving this problem is just loading your entity with the\nchildren\u2019s you need in that particular use case.\n\n    \n    \n    Author::with('books')->get()\n\nThis will reduce the number of queries needed significantly.\n\n## 3\\. Identifying and Resolving Slow Queries\n\nMonitoring and addressing slow queries is essential for maintaining optimal\ndatabase performance.\n\nTechniques such as adding indexes, partitioning tables, and optimizing query\nexecution can help in improving overall database efficiency.\n\nTry to analyze your most common queries with MySQL EXPLAIN and EXPLAIN\nANALYZE. This will give you super useful information about how the query is\nbeing executed and in how many steps. With the proper indexes, and sometimes,\nchoosing just the fields you need, you can x10 uno query performance.\n\n## 4\\. Cache Implementation Strategies\n\nWhile caching can enhance application speed, it's crucial to use it\njudiciously.\n\nSometimes, using cache is more a problem than a solution. We have to avoid\nusing cache if we can, but there are some use cases where a few seconds of\ncache, or depending in the use case more, can improve our app performance by a\nlot.\n\nImplement caching only where necessary to reduce database load and improve\nresponse times.\n\nProper caching strategies can significantly benefit the performance of your\nLaravel app.\n\n## 5\\. Exploring Laravel Octane for Performance Boost\n\nConsider integrating Laravel Octane into your application to handle concurrent\ntasks efficiently.\n\nBy utilizing Swoole under the hood, Octane can improve application\nperformance, especially in scenarios requiring high levels of concurrency.\n\nIt requires some extra work, there are something that doesn\u2019t work in the same\nway, but it is something worth analyzing and thinking about if we need to\nscale our application in a big way.\n\nScaling a Laravel application to manage over 3 million requests per month\nrequires a comprehensive approach encompassing efficient job handling, code\noptimization, query tuning, caching strategies, and innovative solutions like\nLaravel Octane.\n\nBy implementing these strategies diligently, you can ensure your Laravel app\nscales seamlessly and delivers a smooth user experience even under high\ntraffic volumes.\n\n\u2190 Go back to the blog\n\n## Work with me\n\nDo you own a company or need help with your Laravel project?

For starters, the annual cost of a full-time senior-level\ndeveloper now exceeds $100,000, plus benefits (and good luck finding one\navailable).\n\nAside from that, you may not always have enough work to keep them busy at all\ntimes, so you're stuck paying for time you aren't able to utilize.\n\nWith the monthly plan, you can pause and resume your subscription as often as\nyou need to ensure you're only paying your developer when you have work\navailable for them.\n\nNo, once subscribed you're able to request as many things as you'd like, and\nthey will be delivered one by one.\n\nDelivery will always be fast without compromising quality. Very complex\nrequests will be divided into smaller products for continuous delivery.\n\nAlways, before starting to work, we can make a planning so that you know,\nbefore starting, when each change will be delivered.\n\nYou'll work directly with me, the founder and only person behind DeveloperJoy.\n\nWe understand you may not have enough work to fill up entire month. Perhaps\nyou only have one or two requests at the moment. That's where pausing your\nsubscription comes in handy.\n\nBilling cycles are based on 31 day period. Let's say you sign up and use the\nservice for 21 days, and then decide to pause your subscription. This means\nthat the billing cycle will be paused and you'll have 10 days of service\nremaining to be used anytime in the future\n\nI had experience making products with PHP, Go, and JavaScript/TypeScript.\n\nAlso I feel really comfortable working with WordPress, Laravel, Symfony,\nVue.js, React, Svelte, and more.\n\nMail me and we will see how best to collaborate.\n\nYou can make this request by email, sharing a task board with me or, depending\non your plan, by call or Slack.\n\nThat's fine. You can pause your subscription when finished and return when you\nhave additional requests needs. There's no need to let the remainder of your\nsubscription go to waste.\n\nDue to the high quality nature of the work, there will be no refunds issued.\n\n\u00a9 2024 DeveloperJoy\n\n  * Pricing\n  * Blog\n  * Contact\n  * Login\n\n", "frontpage": false}
