Credit: ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces (2023). DOI:\n10.1021/acsami.3c11235\n\nA research team has developed an inorganic-organic thermoelectric composite\nthat promises competitive pricing while addressing efficiency and flexibility\nchallenges in thermoelectric technology.\n\nThermoelectric technology, an energy conversion technology between heat and\nelectricity, represents an eco-friendly approach to converting waste heat into\nelectricity. It is known for its ability to generate power from heat and\nprovide cooling effects using electricity.\n\nWith applications ranging from waste heat recovery generation and refrigerant-\nfree cooling devices in traditional industries to precision temperature\ncontrol systems through localized cooling and heating and continuous power\nsupply energy harvesters in advanced new industries, its versatility is\nreceiving significant attention.\n\nDespite ongoing research and development on various types of bulk and thin-\nfilm thermoelectric materials and devices, owing to the advantages of\nthermoelectric technology, the chronic issue of lower efficiency and\nflexibility, as compared to other energy conversion technologies, has been a\npersistent challenge.\n\nAccordingly, the team at the Nano Convergence Research Department, led by\nPrincipal Researcher Kim Cham, manufactured an inorganic-organic\nthermoelectric composite by combining conventional inorganic thermoelectric\nmaterials with conductive polymers to maximize the efficiency and flexibility\nof thermoelectric materials.\n\nNotably, the team developed a manufacturing process capable of synthesizing\nand mixing organic and inorganic components, overcoming the technical\nchallenge of maintaining a uniform phase and securing high density. The\ninorganic-organic thermoelectric composite produced through this process\nboasts not only excellent thermoelectric properties but also flexibility and\ncost reduction.\n\nPrincipal Researcher Kim Cham of DGIST's Nano Convergence Research Department\nstated, \"Through this research, we were able to develop a new material that\nmaximizes the utility of eco-friendly energy technology, i.e., thermoelectric\ntechnology. We will continue our efforts to scale up the production technology\nof thermoelectric composites and stabilize their performance for\ncommercialization, aiming for wide application in both traditional and\ncutting-edge new industries.\"\n\nThe paper is published in the journal ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.\n\nMore information: Cham Kim et al, Selective Charge Carrier Transport and\nBipolar Conduction in an Inorganic/Organic Bulk-Phase Composite: Optimization\nfor Low-Temperature Thermoelectric Performance, ACS Applied Materials &\nInterfaces (2023).
