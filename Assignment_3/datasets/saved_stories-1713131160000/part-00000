The compatibility list includes iOS or iPadOS\n11 or later, M1 Macs running macOS 11.0 or later, and the Apple Vision Pro.\n\nThe VICE-based emulator by Raffaele Amuso is able to load .T64 and .D64 files\nas if they are floppy disks, with it also offering various programs and\nsources written in CBM64 basic.\n\nAnother emulator aimed at more mainstream gamers is iGBA, a Gameboy Advance\nand Gameboy Color emulator from Mattia La Spina, with it claimed to accurately\nrun Gameboy Color games with extensive customization options.\n\nAgain, the emulator can run on iPhones and iPads running iOS 12 or iPadOS 12,\nM1 Macs, and the Apple Vision Pro.\n\nBoth apps are listed as free to download and without any in-app purchases.\n\nUnder Apple's rule changes, emulators must adhere to a number of guidelines,\nincluding adding ways to filter objectionable content, follow all privacy\nguidelines, and to not share data or privacy permissions with other software.\nHowever, the nature of emulators makes it hard to determine how some of the\nrules will be enforced by Apple at all.\n\nThe concept of emulation itself is legal, but to play games legally, it is\ngenerally accepted that users must own the original ROM files for games they\nwant to use. AppleInsider strongly recommends that potential players check out\ntheir local laws to determine their particular legal requirements.\n\nFollow AppleInsider on Google News\n\nMalcolm Owen\n\nProduct Comparison Expert\n\nBased in South Wales, Malcolm Owen has written about tech since 2012, and\npreviously wrote for Electronista and MacNN.
