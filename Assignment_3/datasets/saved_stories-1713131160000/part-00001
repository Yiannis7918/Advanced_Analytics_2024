In its cornerstone was a time capsule, interred in 1874\nwhen the building was still known as \u201cthe Main Building.\u201d Shortly before the\ncapsule was exhumed and opened this winter, University Archivist Kathleen\nSmith shared her excitement\u2014and apprehension: \u201cYou don\u2019t know what condition\nthe materials will be in.\u201d\n\nSmith knew what was inside, thanks to a newspaper article of that era. Those\nobjects highlighted what the university community valued so soon after\nVanderbilt\u2019s founding: a Bible and a hymnal, newspapers and church circulars,\nand a copy of Cornelius Vanderbilt\u2019s original donation papers.\n\nWhen the capsule was opened in late February, Smith was disappointed to find\nthat the copper box had been infiltrated by an archivist\u2019s worst enemies:\nwater and mold. \u201cThe paper items are almost a complete loss,\u201d she says. She\u2019s\nnow part of the team working to salvage some of the contents.\n\nIt\u2019s a painful but useful object lesson for preservationists planning a time\ncapsule for Kirkland\u2019s new cornerstone. But to Vice Provost for Arts and\nLibraries Tracy Denean Sharpley-Whiting, Kirkland itself is a time capsule:\nIt\u2019s a beautiful, stately structure that embodied the founders\u2019 hopes for the\nuniversity 150 years ago. \u201cBut it\u2019s leaky. It\u2019s not ADA-compliant,\u201d she says.\nThe updated Kirkland will retain its venerable elegance while honoring modern\npriorities of functionality and accessibility. \u201cKirkland is representative of\nthis time capsule,\u201d she says\u2014simultaneously preserving history and looking\nahead.\n\nSharpley-Whiting says that the grand sweep of aspirations across time is\nexactly what a capsule should communicate. So as she, Smith and University\nLibrarian Jon Shaw work together to design a time capsule that will convey a\nmessage to the future university community, they share tips about how to\ncreate your own.\n\n## 1\\. Location, location, location\n\nChoose a location where the time capsule is likely to be found. Enclosing it\nin a building that\u2019s treasured by a community or an institution\u2014and thus,\nlikely to be renovated instead of demolished\u2014will increase the odds it will be\nopened one day by the audience you have in mind.\n\nKeep the capsule in a cool, dry, stable environment, safe from water and too\nmuch light exposure. \u201c[In Kirkland] they\u2019re going to use a new cornerstone,\u201d\nSmith says. \u201cSo hopefully it\u2019ll be protected from the elements.\u201d\n\n## 2\\. The container matters\n\nThe capsule should be made of chemically inert materials such as stainless\nsteel, aluminum or uncoated polyethylene. It should seal tightly\u2014usually with\na screw top and rubber gasket\u2014to keep out water, light and dirt.\n\nInside the container, you can package like items together in smaller, inert\ncontainers such as acid-free paper envelopes or uncoated PET zip-closure bags.\n\n## 3\\. Be mindful of materials\n\nChoose items that will last for 100 years or more. Smith suggests that printed\nmaterials be on high-quality, acid-free paper whenever possible. Paper made\nwith wood pulp, such as newsprint or mid-century pulp novels, contains acid\nthat will break down the paper over time. \u201cSurround things that aren\u2019t acid-\nfree on either side with acid-free paper,\u201d she advises. Also, black-and-white\nphotographs survive better than color photos. Consider choosing analog media\nover electronic\u2014people of the future might not have the equipment to read a\nzip drive.\n\n## 4\\. Tell a story\n\nShaw envisions a collection of things that would portray the university\u2019s\nevolution\u2014and its aspirations. To represent the past, he\u2019d want to incorporate\nsomething like a facsimile of \u201cCornelius Vanderbilt\u2019s letter talking about the\nreunification of the country, and how Vanderbilt is supposed to be this place\nto bring both sides together.\u201d Shaw and Sharpley-Whiting point out that\nVanderbilt\u2019s growth into an inclusive institution with global reach far\nexceeds the vision the founders had 150 years ago, in the fractured, post-\nCivil War milieu they inhabited. \u201cThey would be astounded,\u201d Sharpley-Whiting\nsays. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to give a sense of how far we\u2019ve come.\u201d\n\nShe hopes to include items that capture a broad swath of present-day\nuniversity culture; e.g., student newspapers, trustees\u2019 minutes, campus maps\nand photographs of student life. That culture is inherently forward-looking\nbecause Vanderbilt is \u201cin the business of ideas and innovation,\u201d Sharpley-\nWhiting says. \u201cWe help shape future leaders.\u201d\n\nBuilding on this idea, Shaw envisions another way the capsule might highlight\nVanderbilt\u2019s future: enclosing a \u201cstudent\u2019s narrative or a penned letter to\nthe future of what they can imagine that future being,\u201d he says. \u201cReading\nabout that 100 years from now would really give a sense of \u2018Where do we think\nwe\u2019re going?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe condition of the contents in the time capsule interred in Kirkland Hall\u2019s\ncornerstone and opened in February emphasizes the importance of using a\nwaterproof container for housing important documents and objects.\n\nWatch a video about Vanderbilt\u2019s time capsules at vu.edu/time-capsule.\n\nVisit vu.edu/capsule-survey to suggest items to include in the new time\ncapsule.\n\n### Keep Reading\n\n  * ### Vanderbilt archivists reflect on university\u2019s 1874 time capsule while preparing to create another for the next generation\n\n  * ### Conversation Pieces: If these items could talk...\n\n#### Explore Story Topics\n\n  * Expertise\n  * Prologue\n  * publications\n  * Spring-Summer 2023\n  * Vanderbilt Magazine\n  * Jon Shaw\n  * Kathleen Smith\n  * kirkland hall\n  * time capsule\n  * Tracy Denean Sharpley-Whiting\n  * Vanderbilt Magazine\n\nVanderbilt University\n\n  * University Leadership\n  * Residential Colleges\n  * Equity, Diversity and Inclusion\n  * This Is Vanderbilt\n  * Research@Vanderbilt\n\n  * Working at Vanderbilt\n  * Events\n  * Logins\n  * Campus Map\n  * Media Resources\n\nNashville, Tennessee 37240\n\n615-322-7311 \u2022 Contact Us\n\nVanderbilt University\u2019s Online Privacy Notice\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Instagram\n  * YouTube\n  * TikTok\n  * Flickr\n\nVanderbilt University is committed to the principle of equal opportunity.\nVanderbilt University does not discriminate against individuals on the basis\nof their race, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, color,\nnational or ethnic origin, age, disability, military service, or genetic\ninformation in its administration of educational policies, programs, or\nactivities; admissions policies; scholarship and loan programs; athletic or\nother University-administered programs; or employment.
