Have you ever been served that with your\nsushi?\n\nI've got news for you, unless you're Japanese or frequent super-fancy sushi\nestablishments, you most likely haven\u2019t.\n\nThat green stuff they call wasabi is not real wasabi, made from Wasabia\njaponica.\n\nNo, it's horseradish where they add artificial green coloring to give it the\nappearance of real wasabi.\n\nThe green spicy concoction they try to pass as wasabi tastes very different\nthan real wasabi.\n\nMost people when they talk about Scrum, they are talking about artificially\ncolored horseradish and not wasabi.\n\nNow, the problem is, if you were to taste real wasabi you would think they\u2019ve\nmade a mistake. Why did they not give me real wasabi?\n\nThe fake condiment has become the real condiment.\n\nWe have exactly the same problem with Scrum.\n\nThe state of Scrum mirrors our wasabi situation: almost nobody has a clue what\nreal Scrum looks like, even if it would be right in front of their eyes.\n\nThey would believe it to be something fake, as it is so far removed from what\nthey usually observe.\n\nThanks for reading Maarten\u2019s Newsletter!

PetersenPragmatic Software Development1 hr agoAn analogy, not a\nmetaphor. Most \u201cWasabi\u201d is fake. Given the outward facing parts of Scrum were\nco-opted from Professors Takeuchi and Nonaka by 1995.. anything labeled\n\u201cScrum\u201d since then is indeed fake.
