I remember going to\nthe house of the Dean of Students, who was a good friend, and listening to\nmusic on an extremely high end sound system. First, I\u2019ll never forget how\nbeautiful his huge Musical Fidelity integrated amp with an external power\nsupply was. And second...the sound moved me like little in life ever had. I\nwas hooked. I got some JBL S412s, some cheap Denon amp, and then splurged on\nan SACD player. As my family can attest, I sat in my room for hours a day\nburying myself in the joy of music, frequently much to their consternation\nwhile trying to sleep.\n\nI\u2019ve previously discussed my adoration of music and high end audio equipment.\nAs someone who struggles to relax and enjoy life, music provides a much needed\nrespite.\n\nThanks for reading Innovation Nation!

I\nwant to share it with you.\n\nSee, stereo (that is, a left and right channel) music has been the standard\nsince 1933. It came in many formats from vinyl to cassette tape to CDs to\nmodern streaming music, which actually comes in numerous unique formats (ask\nme about it in the comments). Meanwhile, movies have been something else\nentirely. For decades, they have incorporated surround speakers to place sound\naround you. This started with Dolby Digital way back on VHS. Blu Rays really\nupped the standard with things like DTS TrueHD which honestly sounds\nfantastic.\n\nBut today\u2019s ultra high quality movies and tv shows use a very unique format\nlaunched around 2016: Dolby Atmos.\n\nDolby Atmos is truly a fascinating invention. It first has a normal 5 or 7\nchannel high quality surround mix, but then has another entirely different\nlayer of sound. This unique layer is individual sound tracks placed in 3\ndimensional space around the listener. What this means in practice are\nspeakers on the ceiling in front, above, and behind you so that these sounds\ndo not come out of one speaker, but actually sound like they are coming from a\n3d location around you. Atmos tracks can even have these sounds move in three\ndimensional space (and it\u2019s incredible to hear).\n\nThe effect on movies with a good setup is amazing. In previous theater rooms\nwhere I had surround speakers, Dolby Digital and the like always seemed to\nemanate from the point of that speaker. Sure, you could hear something behind\nyou but you could tell it was that speaker. Even in front of me I could always\ntell which speaker a sound was coming from. I thought this was what surround\nsound was supposed to sound like.\n\nMeanwhile, in my high end 2 channel setup, I have what we audiophiles call a\ngreat \u201csoundstage.\u201d That is, I don\u2019t hear my speakers at all. I hear each\ninstrument placed somewhere between them like the band is set up in front of\nme. My music doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s coming from the speakers at all. It\u2019s\nsomething every audiophile pays a lot of attention to and invest a lot in\ngetting right. For instance, placement of speakers and how you aim them plays\na huge role in creating this experience.\n\nNow, with my new 7.1.4 (7 surround channels at ear height, 1 subwoofer, and 4\nceiling speakers) playing Dolby Atmos movies...my speakers disappear. It\u2019s\nhonestly mind blowing. Sounds come from the exact location of where, say, a\ngunshot is made in 3d space, not in the direction of one speaker. It\u2019s\nactually hard to discern the ceiling speakers. I\u2019ve even had to put my ear to\none and to check if it was even working.\n\nThe result is that you feel enveloped in sound. It\u2019s like comparing swimming\non the surface of a pool to diving in. It\u2019s a remarkable feat of engineering\nand lets you disappear into movies much more than I ever have in my life. You\nmay have noticed modern IMAX theaters sound incredible and that\u2019s because they\nuse this kind of Dolby Atmos setup.\n\nBut we were talking about music! Because, only recently, has some music been\nupgraded to Dolby Atmos. The best way of obtaining it is streaming through\nApple Music who refers to this as \u201cSpatial Audio,\u201d which you may have heard\nof. So I have my Apple TV hooked up and tried some of Apple\u2019s Spatial Audio.\n\nNow, results are mixed and I\u2019ll get to why in a minute. But this is a crazy\nnew way of listening to music. Instruments are not placed across a two\ndimensional axis in front of me, but instead surround me from every direction!\nAgain, it\u2019s like diving into a pool of music where you are simply surrounded\nby it.\n\nWhen it works well, it\u2019s incredible. Music has never been so exciting. It\nmakes my heart race. To put it very simply, rather than sitting in front of\nthe stage, I feel like I\u2019m standing on it, surrounded by a band.\n\nBut the problem is it\u2019s inconsistent. See, music made in this format is as\nmuch a reflection of the sound engineer as it is of the recording since they\nare arbitrarily placing sounds in literal three dimensional space.\n\nThis is what it looks like to make:\n\nAudio engineers have a much more difficult job. Rather than simply moving one\nslider between left and right, they can place any track at any angle, at any\nheight, and at any distance from the listener. The number of variables went up\nexponentially.\n\nAnd it shows. Some songs like, and I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to admit this,\nTaylor Swift\u2019s Blank Space (Taylor\u2019s Version) sound absolutely phenomenal\nutilizing the height and surround speakers to effortlessly help you enjoy the\nmusic in three dimensions.\n\nBut other songs like Coldplay\u2019s The Scientist...don\u2019t sound so unique. They\nsound more like they are pumping audio from the surround speakers just because\nthey are there.\n\nWhat results is an odd experience. Maybe 25% of the songs I have tried sound\nabsolutely fantastic. This would be my preferred way of listening to them. But\nyou can tell that in the rest the engineer either didn\u2019t have the experience\nor the vision to make a mix that was more moving or interesting than the\nsimple stereo version.\n\nThe other issue is when you have 9 speakers, switching in size and quality\nfrom big front left and right speakers to little, incapable ones in the\nceiling, the quality of the sound gets downgraded from a typical audiophile\ntwo channel setup. So while I can hear the damper pedal on Einaudi's Nuvole\nBiance in my living room, I can\u2019t in my theater. The detail isn\u2019t there. Other\ndetails like hearing fingernails on guitar strings get lost in the sea of\naudio as well, especially with the inconsistency in quality of speakers.\n\nSo what does it all mean? Well first off, this is definitely the future of\nmusic. Dolby Atmos isn\u2019t just meant for a fully equipped theater room like\nmine. Everything from headphones to sound bars to TVs and everything else in\nbetween frequently decodes Dolby Atmos. This new encoding format, with the\nright mastering, will make music sound better on any setup. If you have Apple\nMusic, give this playlist a try. You\u2019re likely to have an interesting\nexperience. Make sure to play it on the best setup you have and not that\nstreaming through AirPlay negates the effects. If you have an Apple TV and\nsomething like a soundbar or better, you definitely have to try this asap.\n\nSo, have I changed my listening spot from my couch? Not yet. There\u2019s a very\nlimited number of songs available in this format and not many of my favorites.\nIs if a fun gimmick when I want to relax? You bet. And I\u2019ll bet there\u2019s a lot\nmore coming in the future.\n\nGod I love technology.\n\nThanks for reading Innovation Nation!
