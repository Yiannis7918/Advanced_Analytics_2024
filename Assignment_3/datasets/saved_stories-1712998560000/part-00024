We introduce a novel population-based method for\n> numerical optimization using LLMs called Language-Model-Based Evolutionary\n> Optimizer (LEO). Our hypothesis is supported through numerical examples,\n> spanning benchmark and industrial engineering problems such as supersonic\n> nozzle shape optimization, heat transfer, and windfarm layout optimization.\n> We compare our method to several gradient-based and gradient-free\n> optimization approaches. While LLMs yield comparable results to state-of-\n> the-art methods, their imaginative nature and propensity to hallucinate\n> demand careful handling. We provide practical guidelines for obtaining\n> reliable answers from LLMs and discuss method limitations and potential\n> research directions.\n\nSubjects:| Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2403.02054 [cs.AI]  \n(or arXiv:2403.02054v1 [cs.AI] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2403.02054arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Shuvayan Brahmachary [view email] [v1] Mon, 4 Mar 2024 13:57:37 UTC\n(7,409 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Large Language Model-Based Evolutionary\nOptimizer: Reasoning with elitism, by Shuvayan Brahmachary and 8 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.AI\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2403\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
