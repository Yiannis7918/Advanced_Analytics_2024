Since then we have been working together on the soundtrack of\nFactorio Space Age. Conceptualising and finding solutions to our not small\namount of problems, and filling the expansion with quality music, specially\ndesigned for the best possible Factorio experience.\n\nPetr is a very special musician, because besides being a proven master of\nelectronic music, his education and experience in the conservatory makes him\ncapable of composing music using the full range of a classic orchestra. His\nmodern style of going to more experimental solutions, makes him very flexible\nat creating the score of the Factorio Space Age expansion.\n\n#### Orchestrated music\n\nThis time though, since we are combining electronics and orchestral music, we\ndecided to record the orchestrated parts with a real orchestra in a real\nstudio. The difference, as you know, between a synthetic orchestra and a real\none can be huge.\n\nThe experience of playing the game with this soundtrack must be, at least,\nnoticeable.\n\n#### Recording sessions\n\nRecording music with a traditional orchestra is a big challenge, which\nrequires a long process and a really complex coordination. From music\ndirecting and composing, to orchestration, coordination of all the musicians,\narrangements, recording, post production, etc.\n\nIn the case of our soundtrack, 174 professionals are involved, without\ncounting the Factorio team. The music production company Soundsgate, which\nrepresents Petr, is taking care of this whole process for us.\n\nThe recording sessions of our soundtrack have been held since November 2023 in\nthe \u010cesk\u00fd Rozhlas studios, in Prague. I post you here some pictures of the\nfirst recording session.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>\n\n### Current soundtrack will stay as 'Nauvis' soundtrack\n\nThe style of the Factorio 1.1 soundtrack was already given by our dear Daniel\nJames Taylor. Petr had to adapt his work to continue with Daniel's Nauvis\nsoundtrack. That doesn't mean that the expansion of the soundtrack won't add\nnew colours and textures to the game. Totally the contrary. The new content\nfor the expansion, as its name says, expands the soundscape of Factorio to new\ndimensions.\n\nIn general, what the soundtrack tries to do, is to accompany the player\nthroughout all the mental processes required by the game, to focus the\nattention at the time of designing the factories and its logistics. So the\nmusic should create a balanced and relaxed atmosphere to allow the player to\nconcentrate.\n\nThe music is not decoration, it helps the player to have a better immersive\nexperience and also to visualise what is not shown on the screen.\n\n#### The Factorio motif\n\nA constant in the entire soundtrack, and I'm adding Daniel's work also, is the\nFactorio motif. I'm sure you have it tattooed on your brain already. Do you\nremember the melody that sounds when loading the game?. Yes you do. Well, Petr\ndeveloped an entire universe based on these couple of notes.\n\nThis melody sounds through all the planets with many different moods, rhythms\nand instruments. The good part is that you don't hear it clearly, one just\nfeels it. This is amazing because it creates this sort of coherent cosmos that\nundoubtedly belongs to Factorio. One example is the video of Vulcanus, coming\nbelow.\n\nSomething also shared by all the planets, is the idea of a sense of wonder. We\nwant to express how incredibly nice and positive the discovery of all these\nnew worlds is. Some of the tracks in different planets have this idea behind\nthem.\n\n#### Factorio engine constraints\n\nWe don't have a way for the engine to tell the music system what is happening\nin the game. In other words, the music system has no idea if the player is in\nthe middle of a battle destroying biter nests, or meticulously placing\ntransport belts to satisfy the needs of a growing factory.\n\nThis fact is greatly limiting the creative solutions at the time of composing\nthe score. Imagine the player quietly placing pipes to simply connect 2\nmachines, and suddenly there is super epic battle music in the background.\nThis would create a silly situation, and we don't want that.\n\nThe solution that we decided to take is, instead of trying to illustrate the\naction itself, we better go for a description of the landscape, in a more\nambient solution. The atmosphere of the planet and its nuances. The mood and\nits variations.\n\nThe music must be neutral in a way of not having big emotive peaks, but on the\nother hand it should be rich and dynamic, otherwise it would become dull. So\nthe balance between neutral and expressive is something very important to\ncontrol.\n\n### There are 4 new planets + Space, so we will have 5 unique soundscapes\n\nEvery planet/surface has its own mood, shapes, and spirit. The player should\nfeel on which surface the action is focused, without having to look at the\ngraphics. Well, this is a very subjective matter, sometimes it is clear for\nsome, sometimes not that much. But you get the point.\n\nAt the beginning of the project we had to work almost blindly, because none of\nthe graphics or gameplay were fully designed, just ideas, which is what anyone\nneeds to start anything. But now it is different, with all the work done by\nthe team, we can start showing little tastes of how things come together.\n\nAll the music excerpts and visuals presented in this post are Work in\nProgress. The videos are meant to be proof of concepts. I made them to easily\nvisualise all these concepts that I'm talking about. I hope you enjoy them.\n\n#### Space\n\nThe space platform is the most tricky one, because it has 2 modes: stationary\nin space, and in motion. So we decided to cover both cases with 2\ncomplementary elements:\n\n  * We use a spacey atmosphere (obviously), with a bit of synth electronics trying to describe how it feels floating in the cold void of the universe.\n  * We use a rhythmic bass for the feeling of the platform movement, the powerful thrusters impulsing the big mass of metal. Like a space ferry, \"slow\" but unstoppable.\n\n#### Vulcanus\n\nDark, oppressive, hot and heavy. But also wonderful.\n\nWe found it very coherent and appropriate to use long chords of brass\ninstruments. These are pointing to the magnificence of this fantastic\nlandscape, with contrast to the hazardous volcanoes and lava.\n\n#### Fulgora\n\nThe main theme in this area is electro-magnetism. We are aiming for more\nelectric sounds. Petr made lots of experiments with the sound of electricity.\nLike tapping an audio jack with his finger and recording rhythms with it, then\nmanipulating it for use in the compositions.\n\nThe excerpt shown in this video illustrates it quite well.\n\n#### The other 2 planets\n\nIn the future we will explain more about the other planets, for now these are\nundisclosed subjects. But I can't resist showing a little bit more, this time\nwithout graphics. Listen to this track and imagine a remote and unexplored\nplanet, full of...\n\n### Over 5 hours of soundtrack\n\nEvery surface of the game plays around 1h of music. That means that we have to\nplay 5 hours of soundtrack, +1h of Nauvis. Next week we will speak about some\ntechniques that we developed to not only cover this amount of time, but also\nsurpass it.\n\n#### What's next?\n\nNow we have all the demos and recordings of the orchestrated parts. We don't\nyet have the final mixes, only a few of Petr's pre-mixes. Every step in the\nprocess produces changes in the track, normally for the better.\n\nWe are also starting to see in a better shape the graphics and the gameplay.\nSo I'm going to put all this material in the engine before the final mixes, in\norder to test it and get feedback.\n\nI'm quite sure that we will be able to fine-tune the entire soundtrack in a\nway that pays off all the energy Petr (and everybody involved) put in to such\na crazy project.\n\nStay tuned.\n\nAs always, orchestrate your thoughts at the usual places.\n\nDiscuss on our forums Discuss on Reddit Subscribe by email\n\nTerms of Service|Privacy|Imprint|Presskit|Contact|RSS|Jobs\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 - 2024 Wube Software - all rights reserved.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
