The\nincome is passive and you don't have to do anything after the setup but keep\ngetting payouts to your account. The main advantage of this script is the use\nof multiple proxies through docker containers. This script has been tested in\nlinux amd64, armv7, arm64 or aarch64 platforms. Your income depends on the\nnumber of proxies used and the location of proxy. If you use all the apps\nmentioned, you can earn about $50 per month or more from 1 IP depending on the\nlocation of the proxy. Please read the legal terms or FAQ section of the\nrespective apps if you have any queries on the type of traffic sent.\n\n## \ud83d\udcb0 Register with the following links:\n\n1\\. EarnApp| 2\\.

It\nresets every 4 hours. Please use tunproxy branch to test it using proxies.\n\n## \ud83d\udc47 Next steps\u2753\n\nDownload the code and edit the configuration file properties.conf with your\naccount details. If you don't have GUI access but have terminal access, use\nthe following commands to download the code.\n\n### Download the code\n\n    \n    \n    wget -O main.zip https://github.com/engageub/InternetIncome/archive/refs/heads/main.zip sudo apt-get install unzip unzip -o main.zip cd InternetIncome-main\n\n  * Please edit the \"properties.conf\" file using the following instructions and save the changes.\n  * If you are using proxies, please set \"USE_PROXIES\" value to \"true\".\n  * When setting your email, password, or token, always use double quotes (\"\") due to special characters.\n  * If you do not wish to use a particular application, leave the default value as it is, and the script will not run for that application.\n\n### Update configuration and save\n\n    \n    \n    vi properties.conf\n\n## \ud83c\udfc3 Run the script\n\nAfter you have followed all the mentioned above steps just run the following\ncommand to start and check your income flow to you \ud83e\udd11 .\n\n### Start the process\n\n    \n    \n    sudo bash internetIncome.sh --start\n\n## \ud83d\uded1 Stop and Delete containers\n\nTo stop and delete all the containers started with the script. Run the\nfollowing command. Note that for earnapp, proxyrack, traffmonetizer and\nmysterium the data is not deleted and same ids will be used on delete and\nstart, since it is required to do manual setup each time you start. Delete\nthem or use a different folder to download the script if you want to change\nthe node ids.\n\n### Stop and delete containers\n\nNote that back up of device Ids and node Ids are present in the same folder of\nthe script.\n\n    \n    \n    sudo bash internetIncome.sh --delete\n\n### Delete backup files and folders\n\nTo delete the backup files and folders created by the script, use the\nfollowing command.\n\n    \n    \n    sudo bash internetIncome.sh --deleteBackup\n\n## \ud83c\udfec Proxies or Hosting Providers\n\nClick here to get proxies or hosting providers with free credits.\n\n## \u2754 FAQ\n\n### \ud83e\udd14 How to use residential proxies\u2753\n\nIf you wish to use proxies, you need to set the value of variable USE_PROXIES\nto true in properties.conf file. Then, create a file name proxies.txt in the\nsame folder you have internetIncome.sh file. Add your proxies in each line in\nthe format protocol://user:pass@ip:port or protocol://ip:port Example\nproxies.txt file below. Use your own proxies.\n\n### Proxy list example format\n\n    \n    \n    socks5://username:password@12.4.5.2:7874 http://username:password@1.23.5.2:7878 socks5://15.4.5.2:7875 http://13.23.5.2:7872\n\nFor any other proxy format, please click here to format proxies.\n\n### \ud83e\udd14 Can I use without proxies\u2753\n\nYes\u2757 You can use the script with direct internet connection by setting the\nvariable USE_PROXIES to false in properties.conf file. This is the default\nconfiguration when you download the script.\n\n### \ud83e\udd14 How to use multiple accounts\u2753\n\nFor multiple users to use the same host, simply create different folders and\ndownload the script in each folder and set the configuration. It is\nrecommended not to create multilple accounts for yourself.\n\n### \ud83e\udd14 How to auto update containers\u2753\n\nTo auto update all containers on the host, run the following command.\n\n    \n    \n    sudo docker run --detach --name watchtower --restart always --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock containrrr/watchtower\n\n### \ud83e\udd14 How to clean up all docker containers on the host\u2753\n\nPlease run the following command to delete all the running and stale\ncontainers on your host. The commands also delete stale docker images.\n\n    \n    \n    sudo docker container ls -a | awk '{print $1}' | xargs sudo docker rm -f sudo docker system prune -f -a\n\n### \ud83e\udd14 Why are some of the containers for the same application offline\u2753\n\nIf your proxies are working properly, ensure that your CPU usage remains below\n80% and that you have enough available RAM. Otherwise, high CPU usage or\ninsufficient RAM could cause the issue you are experiencing. In addition to\nthis, the application website may also be throttling the requests either due\nto multiple authentication requests in a short span of time or the request may\nbe timing out etc. For example in case of iproyals pawns website this happens\nvery frequently when multiple devices are added. Giving a delay between\nstartup of instances is not always a solution for this, since it worked\nwithout any delay sometimes. Restarting the instance multiple times always\nworked. This is something intermittent and related to the application that is\nbeing used. You will need to restart containers manually for those instances\nwhere proxies are offline.\n\n### \ud83e\udd14 Why is Mysterium node not working\u2753\n\nIf you are using proxy instead of direct connection, you may see the node\nonline but no earnings. There is an ongoing issue here xjasonlyu/tun2socks#262\n. However note that mysterium works with VPN. Please use the test branch if\nyou would like to use multiple VPNs. It is crucial to understand that the\nMysterium node operates differently from other applications, as it\nnecessitates the enabling of UDP (User Datagram Protocol). This protocol is\nessential for the proper functioning of the Mysterium node. In the case of\nutilizing SOCKS5 proxies, it is imperative to confirm with your provider\nwhether UDP is enabled for your specific SOCKS5 proxy. When utilizing a direct\ninternet connection, it is imperative to ensure that your firewall is\nconfigured to allow UDP traffic.\n\n### \ud83e\udd14 Where is Mysterium data stored\u2753\n\nThe data pertaining to your Mysterium keys is stored in the designated\n\"mysterium-data\" folder, located in the same directory as the script. It is\ncrucial to note that the script does not remove or delete this folder, as it\ncontains your private keys. Losing these keys would necessitate the payment\nfor a new Mysterium node. Therefore, it is imperative to exercise caution and\nensure the safety and security of the \"mysterium-data\" folder, as it contains\nsensitive and valuable information. By taking appropriate measures to preserve\nand back up this data, you can mitigate the risk of potential loss and\nsubsequent financial implications.\n\n### \ud83e\udd14 How to access 127.0.0.1 urls for ebesucher or mystnodes if GUI is not\navailable in linux\u2753\n\nIf your VPS does not have port restrictions to access your VPS IP globally,\nyou can access your localhost urls by replacing it with your VPS IP address.\nFor example, if your VPS IP address is 2.4.75.2 and you wish to access your\nlocalhost url http://127.0.0.1:2000 ,then replace the IP with your VPS IP to\naccess it elsewhere. The url to access directly using VPS IP would be\nhttp://2.4.75.2:2000\n\nIf your VPS IP is not accessible globally, please run the following command to\nget the corresponsing url.\n\n    \n    \n    ssh -R 80:127.0.0.1:2000 serveo.net\n\nIn the above command 2000 represents the port number of your localhost or\n127.0.0.1. For each browser instance, there is a separate port number. Please\nchange the port number accordingly. You will receive an url after running the\nabove command which can be accessed globally.\n\n### \ud83e\udd14 Where are earnapp node urls stored and how to restore them\u2753\n\nThe UUID or node IDs are required to identify your unique nodes in earnapp\ndashboard. These nodes are stored in earnapp.txt file and are not deleted. The\nsame node Ids will be used when you start the application again. You do not\nneed to delete existing nodes in dashboard and add them again when you use\n--delete option. If you already have an existing node and would like to use it\nvia the script you may add them in earnapp.txt file in the same format as the\nexisting file.\n\n### \ud83e\udd14 How to replace proxies for already running containers\u2753\n\nIf you wish to use change proxies for already running container due to bad\nproxies or proxies being offline, update them in proxies.txt and remove your\nold proxies. Make sure you have the same number of proxies as you had earlier\nin proxies.txt file. Then run the following command.\n\n    \n    \n    sudo bash updateProxies.sh\n\n### \ud83e\udd14 How to use it multiple IP or VPN\u2753\n\nFor advance users who wish to use multiple IP or multiple VPN, please use test\nbranch.\n\n## \ud83d\udcc7 License:\n\n  * This product is available for free and may be freely copied and distributed in its original form.\n  * However, it is prohibited to distribute modified copies of the product.\n  * Personal modifications are allowed for personal use only.\n\n## \u26a0\ufe0f Disclaimer\n\nThis script is provided \"as is\" and without warranty of any kind.
