(A = wood with soil, B = leaves\n(possibly turf), C = compost, D = garden soil (not shown is the top layer of\nmulch to protect against erosion and drying out))\n\nH\u00fcgelkultur (German pronunciation: [\u02c8hy\u02d0\u0261l\u0329k\u028al\u02cctu\u02d0\u0250\u032f]), literally mound bed or\nmound culture, is a horticultural technique where a mound constructed from\ndecaying wood debris and other compostable biomass plant materials is later\n(or immediately) planted as a raised bed. Considered a permaculture practice,\nadvocates claim that the technique helps to improve soil fertility, water\nretention, and soil warming, thus benefitting plants grown on or near such\nmounds.^[1]^[2]\n\n## History[edit]\n\nH\u00fcgelkultur bed prior to being covered with soil\n\nH\u00fcgelkultur is a German word meaning mound culture or hill culture.^[3] Though\nthe technique is alleged to have been practiced in German and Eastern European\nsocieties for hundreds of years,^[1]^[4] the term was first published in a\n1962 German gardening booklet by Herrman Andr\u00e4.^[5] Inspired by the diversity\nof plants growing in a pile of woody debris in his grandmother's garden, Andr\u00e4\npromoted \"mound culture\" as opposed to \"flatland culture\".^[5] This was also\nposited as an easy way to utilise woody debris without burning, which was\nillegal.^[5] Andr\u00e4 appears to have been influenced by Rudolf Steiner's\nbiodynamic agriculture. Steiner explained his biodynamic philosophy as\ndeveloped through meditation and clairvoyance, on the grounds that his methods\nwere \u201ctrue and correct unto themselves.\u201d^[6] Andr\u00e4 quotes a 1924 lecture on\nbiodynamics by Steiner, which describes mixing of soil with composting or\ndecaying material in earthen hillocks.^[5] Joined by author Hans Beba, another\nGerman gardener, \"Hill Culture - the horticultural method of the future\" was\nrevised and republished several times in the 1970s and 1980s.^[5]^[7]\n\nThe technique was later adopted and developed by Sepp Holzer, an Austrian\npermaculture advocate.^[8] More recent permaculture advocates such as Paul\nWheaton strongly promote H\u00fcgelkultur beds as a perfect permaculture\ndesign.^[9]\n\n## Use[edit]\n\n### Construction[edit]\n\nH\u00fcgelkultur bed construction, shown without the top layer of soilH\u00fcgelkultur\nlayout\n\nIn its basic form, mounds are constructed by piling logs, branches, plant\nwaste, compost and additional soil directly on the ground. The pile has the\nform of a pyramid. (Note\u2014Wheaton suggests piling the wood higglety-pigletty\nrather than in a neat stack as shown, for structural engineering of the steep\nslope, or perpendicular to the spine of the mound.) The sides of the two\nslopes both have a grade of between 65 and 80 degrees.^[10] The beds are\nusually about 3 by 6 feet (0.91 by 1.83 m) in area and about 3 feet (0.91 m)\nhigh.^[1] However, this height reduces as decomposition progresses.^[5]\n\nWhen positioned on sloped terrain, the beds need to be placed on contour, or\nput at an angle to the hillside (rather than having them parallel to it). This\nmakes sure the beds do not receive unequal amounts of water. In most cases, it\nis useful to have the beds positioned against the prevailing wind direction.\n\nThe raised bed can form light-duty swales, circles and mazes.^[11]^[12] Mounds\nmay also be made from alternating layers of wood, sod,^[13] compost, straw,\nand soil. Although their construction is straightforward, planning is\nnecessary to prevent steep slopes that would result in erosion.^[8]^[4]\n\nIn his book Desert or Paradise: Restoring Endangered Landscapes Using Water\nManagement, Including Lake and Pond Construction, Holzer describes a method of\nconstructing H\u00fcgelkultur which incorporates rubbish such as cardboard, clothes\nand kitchen waste. He recommends building mounds that are 1 meter (3.3 ft)\nwide and any length. Mounds are built in a 0.7 meters (2.3 ft) trench in sandy\nsoil, and without a trench if the ground is wet.^[10]\n\n### Planting[edit]\n\nThe mound is left to rest for several months before planting,^[5] although\nsome advise immediate planting.^[citation needed]\n\nAnything can be grown on the raised beds, but if the bed will\ndecompose/release its nutrients quickly (so long as it is not made of bulky\nmaterials like tree trunks), more demanding crops such as pumpkins, zucchini,\ncucumbers, cabbages, tomatoes, sweet corn, celery, or potatoes are grown in\nthe first year, after which the bed is used for less demanding crops like\nbeans, peas, and strawberries.^[citation needed]\n\n### Lifespan[edit]\n\nThe original German publications described the mounds as having a lifespan of\n5\u20136 years, after which they had to be rebuilt from scratch.^[5]\n\n## Evidence[edit]\n\nAs of 2017 there are no peer-reviewed scientific studies available regarding\nthe efficacy of the technique.^[5] A few university student projects\ninvestigate H\u00fcgelkultur but have not been published in scientific\njournals.^[5]\n\nOne small scale and short term student project investigated the H\u00fcgelkultur\nmethod as a potential use for yard trimmings waste, and also if lima beans,\nkale and okra planted on a H\u00fcgelkultur mound showed any signs of nutrient\ndeficiency compared to a non-raised control bed. It was found that over 11\ntons of yard trimmings were used in the mound, and no evidence of\nmacronutrient deficiency could be detected in the crops in the short\nterm.^[14] Indeed, despite concerns that incorporation of large quantities of\nhigh carbon woody matter would lead to nitrogen immobilization and hence\nnitrogen deficiency in the crop, a higher level of nitrogen was found in the\nraised bed. However, the micronutrient iron was lower relative to the control\nbed.^[14] The author speculated that no nitrogen deficiency occurred since the\nroots of the plants did not penetrate past the superficial layers of the mound\ninto the deeper wood-containing region.^[14]\n\nA student thesis investigated the water holding capacity of H\u00fcgelkultur beds\nand whether the technique could be useful to prevent karst rocky\ndesertification in China.^[15] Over 3 months of measurements, water\nconcentration in h\u00fcgel mounds remained high. Samples from h\u00fcgel sites\ncontained almost twice as much water as those from flat control plots. It was\nsuggested that 1 ha (2+1\u20442 acres) of h\u00fcgels has 3-10 times more water than a\nflat plot affected by karst rocky desertification.^[15]\n\n## Theory[edit]\n\nLayers of woody material and compost or soil used to build a H\u00fcgelkultur bed\n\nMany publications and websites advocate the technique based on personal\nexperience of the authors.^[5] Some have criticised the technique as lacking\ngenuine scientific principles, and running counter to the ecological\nprinciples of soil building with litterfall.^[5]\n\nH\u00fcgelkultur is said to replicate the natural process of decomposition that\noccurs on forest floors, however in natural ecosystems wood would be present\nat the soil surface.^[5] Trees that fall in a forest often become nurse\nlogs^[8] decaying and providing ecological facilitation to seedlings. As the\nwood decays, its porosity increases, allowing it to store water like a sponge.\nThe water is slowly released back into the environment, benefiting nearby\nplants.^[1]\n\nThese beds are also considered beneficial because of the airpockets created by\nthe settling caused by the wood's decomposition. This gives the benefits of\ntilling, without the destruction of soil microorganisms that come with tilling\n(\"every time you till the soil, you lose 30% of the organic material\n(microbial soil life is killed, and plants feast on their bodies)\"^[16]). And,\nthe organic material of the rotting wood also houses beneficial soil\nmicroorganisms.^[16]\n\nH\u00fcgelkultur beds are said to be ideal for areas where the underlying soil is\nof poor quality or compacted. They tend to be easier to maintain due to their\nrelative height above the ground.^[8]\n\nThe decomposition speed of organic material depends on the carbon to nitrogen\nratio of the material, among other factors. Wood breaks down relatively slowly\nbecause it has one of the highest carbon to nitrogen ratios of all organic\nmatter that is used in composting. If the wood is not processed into smaller\npieces with larger surface area to speed up chemical reactions, breakdown is\neven slower. The decomposition process may, in the short term, take more\nnitrogen from the soil through microbial activity (nitrogen immobilization),\nif not enough nitrogen is available.^[17] Thus, in the short term, the\nfertility of the soil may be decreased before, eventually, perhaps after one\nto two years, the nitrogen level is increased past the original level.^[17]\nTraditionally, therefore, it is said to be advantageous to balance \"browns\"\n(e.g. woodchippings) with \"greens\" (e.g. grass clippings) for efficient\ncomposting, and to allow compost to become well-rotted before applying it to a\nbed, to prevent competition between soil bacteria and plants for nitrogen,\nwhich reduces yield.\n\n## Criticisms and controversy[edit]\n\n### H\u00fcgelkultur mounds as solid earthworks[edit]\n\nH\u00fcgelkultur bed with wildflower overplanting, Los Angeles County arboretum\n\nAlthough H\u00fcgelkultur beds can safely retain water in light-duty applications\n(for example, conserving the moisture of rain that falls on the bed), creating\nheavy-duty rainwater retention areas behind H\u00fcgelkultur beds on contour, to\ncatch surface runoff from surrounding areas, can be dangerous. Some designers\nconflate the H\u00fcgelkultur bed's appearance with that of solid earthworks, but\nH\u00fcgelkultur beds cannot predictably control large amounts of stormwater in the\nway that solid earthworks can. Whereas embankment dams or the hillsides of\nswales can be relied on to hold back many thousands of gallons of water for\nweeks to allow it to seep into the ground, and berms can slow runoff,\nH\u00fcgelkultur beds are different in two ways: earthworks have no buoyant core\n(whereas H\u00fcgelkultur mounds contain logs), and the soil that they are made of\nis compacted. If fresh or dried timber is used in the bed, it may become\nbuoyant in the water-saturated substrate, bursting from the soil covering and\nreleasing all the sitting water through a breach. This can be an issue for\nyears, until the wood is sufficiently rotten and infused with water. Another\nconsideration is that H\u00fcgelkultur beds will degrade, shrinking over time into\nmuch lower mounds of soft, rich soil. This means that the retention area will\nhave less depth as time goes on, but it also means that the uncompacted soil\nwill remain a threat to breaching even if the logs become saturated.\n\nSome permaculturists have taken mild positions against the \"h\u00fcgel swales\"\nstill being promoted by other permaculturists, citing the danger and cross-\npurposes of H\u00fcgelkultur beds and swales. Swales are for long-term\ninstallations where perennials - like fruit trees - are grown. H\u00fcgelkultur is\nused for shorter term, more annual crops, as the soil settling that occurs\nwith hugel decomposition is bad for the root system of fruit trees.^[18] A\ncommon practice is to plant fruit trees beside a hugelkultur mound where some\nnutrient runoff can feed the tree without the tree\u2019s support collapsing under\nit, while also allowing the tree to extend its roots laterally under or upward\ninto the hugelkultur mound as far as it \u201cneeds.\u201d\n\nThere is a recorded instance of a breach occurring in a new project. Upon the\nfirst rainstorm, the retention areas behind the H\u00fcgelkultur beds filled with\nwater and broke through. The released water carried the freshly-buried logs\nand dirt downhill, smashing a hole in a building being used as a church and\nfilling the space with mud. No injuries were reported.^[19]\n\n### Overfertilization, contamination of soil and water habitats[edit]\n\nOver-fertilized plants are said to have less flavor,^[20] and too much\nnitrogen can be consumed by eating certain plants which have been over-\nfertilised (e.g., spinach).^[20] Advocates state that overfertilization is a\nrisk in the first year if woodchips are used, which will break down too\nfast.^[20] Instead raised beds made with whole logs release nutrients slowly\nover a period of years.^[20] It has been suggested that excessive use of\ndecomposing organic matter in H\u00fcgelkultur could leach out and contaminate and\ndisrupt soil and water habitats.^[5]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Agriculture and agronomy portal\n  * Gardening portal\n\n  * Hotbed\n  * Hot container composting\n  * Vertical farming\n  * Za\u00ef, similar African technique\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c ^d Miles, Melissa (August 3, 2010). \"The Art and Science of Making a Hugelkultur Bed \u2013 Transforming Woody Debris into a Garden Resource\".
